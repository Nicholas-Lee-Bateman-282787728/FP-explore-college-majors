With the special features in this Criterion Collection, one gains an insight into the over hour-long interpretation by Japanese-film historian Donald Richie.  An interpretation certainly is helpful to a film that has little dialogue and is rich on visuals.Director Robert Altman speaks about the film and influences from Kurosawa.  And one of the more informative features is an excerpt from ""The World of Kazu Miyagawa, the film's cinematographer.  This, too, is a wonderful lesson on the skill used in shooting this visual masterpiece.A booklet is included, no page numbers, but it includes the full-length dialogue from the source stories ""In a Grove"" and ""Rashomon"".The story is based on four people's interpretation of what happened to a man who was murdered and his wife raped in the woods.  The movie leaves the viewer without any concrete answers; it allows the viewer to decide who is telling the truth, or, if the truth is even spoken.Picture quality is excellent as well as subtitles and it also provides optional subtitle or soundtrack choices.If you have seen this classic foreign film on VHS, choose the DVD Criterion Collection.

Boy was I surprised how well this popular movie was shot, the camera trickery through the woods is spectacular, I love how the sun blazes and blinds the camera in certain shots. There are five different points of view throughtout the film and I think the last take on what really happened to the young married couple is the probably the truth and the best story of Rashomon.

354548,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,6303073107,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[6, 10]","To have a film that holds the coveted title of being the reason that the ""Best Foreign Film"" category was created for the Oscars is one thing, but to be able to back up that myth with a powerful film that speaks both about humanity and the strength of truth is a whole new angle.  Often we witness powerful foreign films that slip through the lines of cinema, regarded by so many as valuable assets to the film community, but never see the gold of Oscar.  In the same sense, sometimes the most popular of those foreign films eventually become Oscar contenders, not because they are worthy enough, but because studios had the funds to allow bigger distribution to audiences, thus allowing popularity to do the rest.  Rashmon is one of those few films that succeed in giving us both a quality film and the accolades to represent it.  Rashmon is a rare breed of film.  The Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa took many bold steps with this film (pointing his camera at the sun, filming deep within the jungle, and the mockery of truth), that it is unlikely that you could go to a modern day Hollywood film without seeing one of these techniques being ""borrowed"".  His bold storytelling, creative camera work, and powerful characters give us a unique story that should be included in everyone's film library.While the characters were strong, the direction was flawless, and the story was compelling, there is a theme that needs to be discussed while talking about Rashmon.  This is the story of murder, betrayal, and rape and in any typical ""courthouse"" film you would have some spineless witness finally break down and confess the truth.  At the end of these films the truth is discovered, but not in Rashmon.  Kurosawa gives us the ""black sheep"" of themes by never really giving us what we really wanted from the beginning of this story.  As I began this film, I thought I was going to get a clear-cut story with honesty and troubled souls, but instead I was handed no prize at the end.  What I sought after the most is not handed to me in a Happy Meal container at the end, but instead trapped still within the film.  Kurosawa gives us the meaning behind the story, that there possibly is no way of knowing the true ""truth"".  Four different souls, seeing the same event all culminating to four different results means that the ""truth"" may never be known.  Kurosawa has taken the story and provided us with the main character being truth, and like Kaiser Soze, the greatest trick it ever pulled was convincing us that ""it didn't exist"".  Deep within Rashmon the truth is hidden, and it may never emerge, but that is what Kurosawa intended.  A viewer could walk away from this film, after several viewings, and discover different truths about the characters and story.  This is a constantly evolving film that will continually get better with time.Outside of these beautiful themes, Rashmon is a flawless film.  From the execution of the actors to the simplicity of the direction, there is plenty in this film to keep your mind busy and your jaw nearly dragging on the floor.  To begin, the performance by Toshiro Mifune ranks among the best in film history.  In each of the stories he is portrayed differently (even in his own) and with precise execution he delivers every time.  He is insane, passionate, loyal, and villainous all at the same time.  While some may see his acting as eccentric or over-the-top, I found each of his portrayals as accurate and astute.  When Mifune is on the screen his presence commands your eyes and you cannot help but become involved.  Second to his performance is that of the troubled wife.  While her characters is the most confusing/suspicious of them all, Masayuki Mori keeps us intertwined with the story by controlling her character with the greatest of ease.  When it is time for her to be unleashed, the true drama of the story is thrown in your face with brilliance and expertise.Overall, I thought that this was a near perfect film.  Kurosawa is intense, original, and adeptly secure about his stories.  I have seen the same passion in Ran, and it cannot be denied.  My only concern with this film is that if you are going to watch this movie, make sure that you can devote your entire mind to it.  I found myself watching it three times because I could not stay focused (outside factors) enough to see those darkly hidden themes.  I especially enjoyed the unearthed darkness of humanity, which is hinted on at the end.  The fact that after hearing these stories of murder and rape, it doesn't stop one from continuing along a similar path.  It is a powerful tale that should be enjoyed by all!Grade: **** out of *****",4,Most of the time we can't even be honest with ourselves.,1136419200,"01 5, 2006",2006,4658,"['have', 'film', 'coveted', 'title', 'being', 'reason', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Film', 'category', 'was', 'created', 'Oscars', 'one', 'thing', 'be', 'able', 'back', 'up', 'myth', 'powerful', 'film', 'humanity', 'strength', 'truth', 'whole', 'new', 'angle', 'witness', 'powerful', 'foreign', 'films', 'slip', 'lines', 'cinema', 'regarded', 'so', 'many', 'valuable', 'assets', 'film', 'community', 'never', 'see', 'gold', 'Oscar', 'same', 'sense', 'sometimes', 'most', 'popular', 'foreign', 'films', 'eventually', 'become', 'Oscar', 'contenders', 'not', 'are', 'worthy', 'enough', 'studios', 'had', 'funds', 'allow', 'bigger', 'distribution', 'audiences', 'thus', 'allowing', 'popularity', 'do', 'rest', 'Rashmon', 'one', 'few', 'films', 'succeed', 'giving', 'quality', 'film', 'accolades', 'represent', 'Rashmon', 'rare', 'breed', 'film', 'Japanese', 'filmmaker', 'Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'took', 'many', 'bold', 'steps', 'film', 'pointing', 'camera', 'sun', 'filming', 'deep', 'jungle', 'mockery', 'truth', 'unlikely', 'could', 'go', 'modern', 'day', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'seeing', 'one', 'techniques', 'being', 'borrowed', 'bold', 'storytelling', 'creative', 'camera', 'work', 'powerful', 'characters', 'give', 'unique', 'story', 'should', 'be', 'included', 'everyone', 'film', 'characters', 'were', 'strong', 'direction', 'was', 'flawless', 'story', 'was', 'compelling', 'theme', 'be', 'discussed', 'talking', 'Rashmon', 'story', 'murder', 'betrayal', 'rape', 'typical', 'courthouse', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'spineless', 'witness', 'finally', 'break', 'down', 'confess', 'truth', 'end', 'films', 'truth', 'discovered', 'not', 'Rashmon', 'Kurosawa', 'black', 'sheep', 'themes', 'never', 'really', 'giving', 'what', 'really', 'wanted', 'beginning', 'story', 'began', 'film', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'get', 'clear-cut', 'story', 'honesty', 'troubled', 'souls', 'instead', 'was', 'handed', 'prize', 'end', 'What', 'sought', 'most', 'not', 'handed', 'Happy', 'Meal', 'container', 'end', 'instead', 'trapped', 'still', 'film', 'Kurosawa', 'meaning', 'story', 'possibly', 'way', 'knowing', 'true', 'truth', 'Four', 'different', 'souls', 'seeing', 'same', 'event', 'culminating', 'four', 'different', 'results', 'truth', 'may', 'never', 'be', 'known', 'Kurosawa', 'taken', 'story', 'provided', 'main', 'character', 'being', 'truth', 'Kaiser', 'Soze', 'greatest', 'trick', 'ever', 'pulled', 'was', 'convincing', 'did', ""n't"", 'exist', 'Deep', 'Rashmon', 'truth', 'hidden', 'may', 'never', 'emerge', 'what', 'Kurosawa', 'intended', 'viewer', 'could', 'walk', 'away', 'film', 'several', 'viewings', 'discover', 'different', 'truths', 'characters', 'story', 'constantly', 'evolving', 'film', 'will', 'continually', 'get', 'better', 'time.Outside', 'beautiful', 'themes', 'Rashmon', 'flawless', 'film', 'execution', 'actors', 'simplicity', 'direction', 'plenty', 'film', 'keep', 'mind', 'busy', 'jaw', 'nearly', 'dragging', 'floor', 'begin', 'performance', 'Toshiro', 'Mifune', 'best', 'film', 'history', 'stories', 'portrayed', 'differently', 'even', 'own', 'precise', 'execution', 'time', 'insane', 'passionate', 'loyal', 'villainous', 'same', 'time', 'may', 'see', 'acting', 'eccentric', 'over-the-top', 'found', 'portrayals', 'accurate', 'astute', 'When', 'Mifune', 'screen', 'presence', 'eyes', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'become', 'involved', 'Second', 'performance', 'troubled', 'wife', 'characters', 'most', 'confusing/suspicious', 'Masayuki', 'Mori', 'intertwined', 'story', 'controlling', 'character', 'greatest', 'ease', 'When', 'time', 'be', 'unleashed', 'true', 'drama', 'story', 'thrown', 'face', 'brilliance', 'expertise.Overall', 'thought', 'was', 'near', 'perfect', 'film', 'Kurosawa', 'intense', 'original', 'adeptly', 'secure', 'stories', 'have', 'seen', 'same', 'passion', 'Ran', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'denied', 'only', 'concern', 'film', 'are', 'going', 'watch', 'movie', 'make', 'sure', 'can', 'devote', 'entire', 'mind', 'found', 'watching', 'three', 'times', 'could', 'not', 'stay', 'focused', 'outside', 'factors', 'enough', 'see', 'darkly', 'hidden', 'themes', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'unearthed', 'darkness', 'humanity', 'hinted', 'end', 'fact', 'hearing', 'stories', 'murder', 'rape', ""n't"", 'stop', 'one', 'continuing', 'along', 'similar', 'path', 'powerful', 'tale', 'should', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'Grade', '****', '*****']",Rashomon VHS

354551,A3NQU1649SH0Q4,6303073107,"Allen Smalling ""Eclectic Reader,""","[3, 3]","RASHOMON is, as most prior reviewers have acknowledged, a classic film that put director Akira Kurosawa, leading man Toshiro Mifune, and cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa on the map, not only in Japan but around the world.Even people who have not seen this wonderful film understand a ""Rashomon"" situation as being what this movie portrays:  a series of events that play out entirely differently when recalled by various people at a criminal arraignment.  This case involves a brutal rape and murder, but a loggerman, a priest, a bandit (Mifune), a veiled lady and her dead husband (portrayed by a ghost) all tell different stories.  Whether intentionally or un, each player in the atrocity tells a version most favorable to him- or herself.  This provokes a crisis of faith in the priest, who begins to wonder if there is any such thing as verifiable reality.  And there's even a surprise ending! (Or two, if you count the last witnessing.)All the cast is good, but Toshiro Mifune, here relatively early in his career, is stellar playing the thief who waylays (or is it encounters?) an upper-class veiled woman on horseback and her solicitous spouse. He plays about every human emotion portrayable in an over-the-top performance that is completely convincing nonetheless. It doesn't hurt that Mifune had one of those intensely masculine faces that are fun to watch under any portrayal.  (His career embraced over 70 feature films, mostly Japanese, including most of Kurosawa's output.)Criterion Collection's version of the DVD has some very good bells-and-whistles that help open up the film.  There's a (subtitled) documentary made for Japanese TV network NHK about cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa and his work on RASHOMON, in which he relates his experiences during filming. Another plus is film scholar Donald Richie's audiotrack commentary, which reveals further interesting cinematographic innovations:  RASHOMON was a very early film (perhaps the first commercial release in Japan) to photograph the sun directly, and to encourage solar ""flare"" (optical streaking that on film prints extends from the sun itself).  There was also a great use of mirrors (including one full-length mirror borrowed from the wardrobe department) for highlighting and the occasional impressionistic effect.Unfortunately this restoration's technical quality, while excellent under any circumstances, does not achieve the level of technical perfection under Criterion's restoration as other classic films I've seen from them, such as RULES OF THE GAME or LA STRADA.  Obvious blemishes had been banished, but the occasional freckling gets through anyway.  Also noticeable at times is the kind of flickering many of us have been exposed to in other black-and-white movies (not to be confused with the deliberate impressionistic use of mirrors as related above).  I doubt these minor demerits will detract from anyone's enjoyment of the film, though; but for the sake of perfection I hope Criterion will restore it yet another time with the very, very latest technology.I also want to point out that RASHOMON is not only profound, but profoundly entertaining.  It uses a very precise screenplay that bears close attention and makes each witness's testimony at least plausible. It's also fast-paced, well-acted, and engrossing.  This film holds up under multiple viewings, partly to coordinate the plotworks from different sources, but also for the sheer joy of seeing an outstanding movie.  Does anyone making films today put together philosophical, narrative and technical elements so well, and combine them with such outstanding action scenes?",5,You have to see RASHOMON to appreciate it,1262908800,"01 8, 2010",2010,3622,"['RASHOMON', 'most', 'prior', 'reviewers', 'have', 'acknowledged', 'classic', 'film', 'put', 'director', 'Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'leading', 'man', 'Toshiro', 'Mifune', 'cinematographer', 'Kazuo', 'Miyagawa', 'map', 'not', 'only', 'Japan', 'world.Even', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'wonderful', 'film', 'understand', 'Rashomon', 'situation', 'being', 'what', 'movie', 'series', 'events', 'play', 'out', 'entirely', 'differently', 'when', 'recalled', 'various', 'people', 'criminal', 'arraignment', 'case', 'brutal', 'rape', 'murder', 'loggerman', 'priest', 'bandit', 'Mifune', 'veiled', 'lady', 'dead', 'husband', 'portrayed', 'ghost', 'tell', 'different', 'stories', 'Whether', 'intentionally', 'un', 'player', 'atrocity', 'version', 'most', 'favorable', 'him-', 'crisis', 'faith', 'priest', 'who', 'wonder', 'such', 'thing', 'verifiable', 'reality', 'even', 'surprise', 'ending', 'two', 'count', 'last', 'witnessing', 'cast', 'good', 'Toshiro', 'Mifune', 'here', 'relatively', 'early', 'career', 'stellar', 'playing', 'thief', 'who', 'upper-class', 'veiled', 'woman', 'horseback', 'solicitous', 'spouse', 'human', 'emotion', 'portrayable', 'over-the-top', 'performance', 'completely', 'convincing', 'nonetheless', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'Mifune', 'had', 'one', 'intensely', 'masculine', 'are', 'fun', 'watch', 'portrayal', 'career', 'embraced', '70', 'feature', 'films', 'mostly', 'Japanese', 'including', 'most', 'Kurosawa', 'output', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'version', 'DVD', 'very', 'good', 'bells-and-whistles', 'help', 'open', 'up', 'film', 'subtitled', 'documentary', 'made', 'Japanese', 'TV', 'network', 'NHK', 'cinematographer', 'Kazuo', 'Miyagawa', 'work', 'RASHOMON', 'experiences', 'filming', 'film', 'scholar', 'Donald', 'Richie', 'audiotrack', 'commentary', 'further', 'interesting', 'cinematographic', 'innovations', 'RASHOMON', 'was', 'very', 'early', 'film', 'perhaps', 'first', 'commercial', 'release', 'Japan', 'photograph', 'sun', 'directly', 'encourage', 'solar', 'flare', 'optical', 'streaking', 'film', 'prints', 'sun', 'was', 'also', 'great', 'use', 'mirrors', 'including', 'one', 'full-length', 'mirror', 'borrowed', 'wardrobe', 'department', 'highlighting', 'occasional', 'impressionistic', 'effect.Unfortunately', 'restoration', 'technical', 'quality', 'excellent', 'circumstances', 'not', 'achieve', 'level', 'technical', 'perfection', 'Criterion', 'restoration', 'other', 'classic', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'such', 'RULES', 'THE', 'GAME', 'LA', 'STRADA', 'Obvious', 'blemishes', 'had', 'been', 'banished', 'occasional', 'freckling', 'anyway', 'Also', 'noticeable', 'times', 'kind', 'flickering', 'many', 'have', 'been', 'exposed', 'other', 'black-and-white', 'movies', 'not', 'be', 'confused', 'deliberate', 'impressionistic', 'use', 'mirrors', 'related', 'doubt', 'minor', 'demerits', 'will', 'detract', 'anyone', 'enjoyment', 'film', 'sake', 'perfection', 'hope', 'Criterion', 'will', 'restore', 'yet', 'time', 'very', 'very', 'latest', 'technology.I', 'also', 'want', 'point', 'out', 'RASHOMON', 'not', 'only', 'profound', 'profoundly', 'entertaining', 'very', 'precise', 'screenplay', 'close', 'attention', 'witness', 'testimony', 'least', 'plausible', 'also', 'fast-paced', 'well-acted', 'engrossing', 'film', 'up', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'partly', 'coordinate', 'plotworks', 'different', 'sources', 'also', 'sheer', 'joy', 'seeing', 'outstanding', 'movie', 'anyone', 'making', 'films', 'today', 'put', 'together', 'philosophical', 'narrative', 'technical', 'elements', 'so', 'well', 'combine', 'such', 'outstanding', 'action', 'scenes']",Rashomon VHS

354553,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6303073107,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 9]","I know this is far from a popular opinion, but I find this lauded classic to be quite sloppy.  It's a messy, redundant film that has a deep message yet fails to really capitalize on its promise.  I really expected (especially with all the heaps of praise) for this film to blow my mind, and sadly it did, just not in a good way.Can you say `over the top'?Better yet, can you say `unnecessary'?Telling the tragic tale of a rape and murder through the eyes of fur separate people who were either party to or witness to the crime, `Rashomon' feels desperate in its attempt to alienate our emotions and cast aside all logic.  It is a film that begs you to get confused, because that is the point.  The film basically tells you up front that truth is nothing more than a belief subject to our own interpretation.  None of the stories told are wrong because they are `as they see it' and so we are not supposed to piece together this chaotic puzzle, we are just supposed to take in the `deeper meaning' Kurosawa presents to us.I would have loved to have done that, but I just couldn't.The film for me suffers in a few major areas.  The pacing is an issue for me.  Telling the same story four times becomes rather tedious and redundant.  There could have been a better way to have constructed this film.  While it is true that the four stories differ drastically, the inclusion of the same setting, scenery, characters and actions tends to grow tiresome.  There isn't enough variety to completely reign in my attention.  Another issue is the spastic acting.  I have mentioned this issue before in previous reviews, but my opinion of Asian cinema is not as high as others.  I find the unrealistically theatrical way they act these films to be rather off putting.  It is chaotic to the enth degree.  In some films it works, but in a film as deeply entrenched (or so it would like to be) in the raw emotional realism of `truth' I found the acting here to be distracting and out of place.What strikes me as even more `hurtful' to the films message is the fact that, when all is said and done, it fails to convey the message thoroughly enough to really make a valid impact.  I got what Kurosawa was trying to say, but I didn't really `feel' it the way it is apparent he wanted me to.Visually, the film is stunning, and there are moments (the ending and that medium scene) that are stellar, but overall, `Rashomon' was a miss for me.  It could have really been a beautiful spectacle, one that I would stand behind and laud immensely, but instead it remains one of those films I just `don't get'.I give it a C, thanks in part to initial concept, Kurosawa's visual direction and Noriko Honma's BRAVE performance.I think I'm being generous.",3,Really?,1259884800,"12 4, 2009",2009,2724,"['know', 'far', 'popular', 'opinion', 'find', 'lauded', 'classic', 'be', 'quite', 'sloppy', 'messy', 'redundant', 'film', 'deep', 'message', 'yet', 'really', 'capitalize', 'promise', 'really', 'expected', 'especially', 'heaps', 'praise', 'film', 'blow', 'mind', 'sadly', 'did', 'just', 'not', 'good', 'way.Can', 'say', 'top', 'Better', 'yet', 'can', 'say', 'unnecessary', 'Telling', 'tragic', 'tale', 'rape', 'murder', 'eyes', 'fur', 'separate', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'either', 'party', 'witness', 'crime', 'Rashomon', 'feels', 'desperate', 'attempt', 'alienate', 'emotions', 'cast', 'aside', 'logic', 'film', 'get', 'confused', 'point', 'film', 'basically', 'up', 'front', 'truth', 'nothing', 'more', 'belief', 'subject', 'own', 'interpretation', 'None', 'stories', 'told', 'are', 'wrong', 'are', 'see', 'are', 'not', 'supposed', 'piece', 'together', 'chaotic', 'puzzle', 'are', 'just', 'supposed', 'take', 'deeper', 'meaning', 'Kurosawa', 'presents', 'us.I', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'have', 'done', 'just', ""couldn't.The"", 'film', 'suffers', 'few', 'major', 'areas', 'pacing', 'issue', 'Telling', 'same', 'story', 'four', 'times', 'becomes', 'rather', 'tedious', 'redundant', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'way', 'have', 'constructed', 'film', 'true', 'four', 'stories', 'differ', 'drastically', 'inclusion', 'same', 'setting', 'scenery', 'characters', 'actions', 'grow', 'tiresome', ""n't"", 'enough', 'variety', 'completely', 'reign', 'attention', 'issue', 'spastic', 'acting', 'have', 'mentioned', 'issue', 'previous', 'reviews', 'opinion', 'Asian', 'cinema', 'not', 'as', 'high', 'others', 'find', 'unrealistically', 'theatrical', 'way', 'act', 'films', 'be', 'rather', 'off', 'putting', 'chaotic', 'enth', 'degree', 'films', 'film', 'deeply', 'entrenched', 'would', 'like', 'be', 'raw', 'emotional', 'realism', 'truth', 'found', 'acting', 'here', 'be', 'distracting', 'place.What', 'strikes', 'even', 'more', 'hurtful', 'films', 'message', 'fact', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'convey', 'message', 'thoroughly', 'enough', 'really', 'make', 'valid', 'impact', 'got', 'what', 'Kurosawa', 'was', 'trying', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'feel', 'way', 'apparent', 'wanted', 'to.Visually', 'film', 'stunning', 'are', 'moments', 'ending', 'medium', 'scene', 'are', 'stellar', 'overall', 'Rashomon', 'was', 'miss', 'could', 'have', 'really', 'been', 'beautiful', 'spectacle', 'one', 'would', 'stand', 'laud', 'immensely', 'instead', 'one', 'films', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", ""get'.I"", 'give', 'C', 'thanks', 'part', 'initial', 'concept', 'Kurosawa', 'visual', 'direction', 'Noriko', 'Honma', 'BRAVE', 'performance.I', 'think', ""'m"", 'being', 'generous']",Rashomon VHS

That's because Rashomon has become part of the world's consciousness & lexicon.  It's story of an action involving several participants, each with their own differing version of the truth, has been elaborated and riffed-on by many others since it appeared on the world's stage in the 50's.So, it is an old movie, often imitated.  And yet, I found it fresh and involving and well worth a look.  As Robert Altman says on the DVD extras, many of the camera techniques, particularly shooting directly at the sun and allowing lens flare, were taboo-breaking and radically new when this film appeared.  Now, that is put in as a joke in Shrek.So you come to Rashomon not to be overwhelmed with its ""newness"" and the refreshing change of first encountering Japanese cinema and acting styles.  No, you come to Rashomon as to an old master, to appreciate its lasting impression of the universality of human foibles and passions and the illusory nature of truth.A rape and murder have occured in a woods.  We hear and see different versions of the same encounter.  Who is telling the truth?  Is there an absolute objective truth, or does every teller of the tale inherently only tell the truth as he sees it?  And if everyone is a ""liar"" and there is no absolute truth, what is the point of anything?Don't let the heavy questions mislead you.  Rashomon moves quickly, fluidly and gracefully, telling its story with economy and, to me, humor.  Much is made of the dark philosophy underneath the theme, but I find great sardonic humor in the film.  One example, the fight between the thief & the man as related by the woodcutter:it is messy and unheroic, sweaty, breathless and awkward and the antithesis of the stylized balletic sword fights found in, even Kurosawa's, samurai movies.In the end, as familiar and much copied as Rashomon has been, it is still like no other film.

354558,A1BJOEQSRX2IBM,6303073107,"Bertin Ramirez ""justareviewer""","[1, 3]","Rashomon is quite simply an amazing piece of filmmaking. Kurosawa was nothing less than a master at his craft. At a technical viewpoint it is an amazing film, the same story is told in 4 different ways by 4 different characters, each of them trying to paint themselves in the best possible light. The camerawork is also amazing, notice for example the shots when a character is walking through the woods in the beginning, there is no dialogue, the sequence is long, there are amazing shots of the sun through the trees, the camera movement is flawless. Notice also how he plants his camera in the prison sequences, a la 'Ozu' (low level steadishots) and how the camera can barely stay still in the woods sequences. The beginning of the film in the apocalyptic storm is overpowering in its effect. The dialogue and acting are also pitchperfect. Notice how actors in Kurosawa films always seem to be screaming their dialogue or laughing in an over the top manner, Kurosawa wasn't aiming for realism (like Ozu does), he's out to make a point and he does it so well, that it shows in how well his films have crossed over to western audiences. This is the first japanese film that was widely seen by american audiences and won the academy award for foreign film, not to mention introducing the great Toshiro Mifune to cinema and beginning arguably the best filmmaking pair ever (not counting Scorsese/DeNiro) with Kurosawa/Mifune, which would go on and make lots of films together. Also the tremendous impact this film has had on the film infustry alone is enough to consider it a classic. Even so, it's ability to move audiences of all nationalities and through the decades, speaks very well of how Kurosawa handled his themes. In it's 90 min. of running time, this film tells you more about human nature than most any film will, it has all the richness that reading a good book might give you, and it is cinematically amazing. If you like this film, I recommend 'Seven Samurai' for Kurosawa or 'Tokyo Story' for more great Japanese cinema.

It's a great idea, but what really makes the picture work so well is that through each version of the story the characterizations deepen and become multi-layered.

354560,AODKUG6FAKD2Z,6303073107,"Bryan Byrd ""reviewer of bad films and good books""","[13, 21]","In a brief introduction to this edition, Robert Altman talks about how 'Rashomon' influenced him as a director - how the day after watching he incorporated into his own work camera angles he'd first seen the day before.  From the perspective of a film buff, even from a casual one, this is instructive and educational.  Others who aren't concerned about film techniques and storytelling methods may wonder what all the fuss is about.Part of the problem when dealing with groundbreaking films like 'Rashomon', and which is unavoidable, is that other filmmakers, like Altman, are going to pilfer from the original until it's as common as its imitations.  Without clues, as a modern viewer, I already have trouble picking out exactly what it was that made the first film so unique, though when it's pointed out, as in commentaries, I do find it noteworthy.  Not necessarily compelling though - and not the primary reason I have for watching a film.As an average member of the audience, it's the story in which I'm interested.  In fact, absorbing stories and different outlooks are why I seek out foreign films in the first place - I'm looking for a distinct perspective on the human condition.  The way that it is told - the art of direction and editing - plays an important part in the effective transmission of that story from director to audience, and may even add depth to the story, but particular techniques tend to lose their surprising originality over time, especially in the case of pioneering, often copied directors like Kurosawa.  So the question is, does 'Rashomon' still tell a compelling story after the once startling imagary is old hat?It begins in a torrential downpour.  Two men, a priest and a woodcutter, have taken refuge in the ruins of an abandoned gatehouse and are joined by a third, a boorish ruffian.  He notices the others are under a horrible mental strain, and badgers them until they tell of the trial they had recently witnessed, and of four eyewitness accounts of a murder and a rape.  Each participant's account is un-reconcilable with the other, until it is unclear if anyone is telling the truth.While the on-screen events of the film may have been somewhat daring for 1950's America, the idea that people will twist their stories around to suit their own temperament and needs could hardly have been astonishing.  Maybe my own cynicism gets in the way, but that the lies of the trial's participants would affect the priest and the woodcutter down to their existential core seems unlikely and contrived.'Rashomon' is a critical favorite - it won the Oscar in 1951 for Best Foreign Language film, is in the top ten of director's favorites, and currently enjoys clear popularity in the film community as evidenced by its ranking on IMDB.  Those factors, and the idea that the film dealt with the slippery notion of truth, led me to expect a truly engaging and thought-provoking film.  By no means is 'Rashomon' a bad movie, but have to say I was under-whelmed.  Of Kurosawa's films, I would handily recommend 'Throne of Blood' over 'Rashomon' for an intense movie experience - and even though it's a different type of movie, I'd say that 'Seven Samurai' is also a better choice.I'm glad that such films as 'Rashomon' are still prized and in print - I enjoy seeing how the medium has evolved and learning about film in general.  But it would be unfair to recommend unreservedly 'Rashomon' to those who are not likely to appreciate it for what it is - a good film with pioneering camera and storytelling techniques that will probably seem ho-hum by today's standard.  Budding auteurs and film buffs will find much to value - those looking solely for morally and mentally challenging content will likely be disappointed.",3,"Lies, Darn Lies, and Movies",1254787200,"10 6, 2009",2009,3750,"['brief', 'introduction', 'edition', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'talks', 'how', ""'Rashomon"", 'influenced', 'director', 'how', 'day', 'watching', 'incorporated', 'own', 'work', 'camera', ""'d"", 'first', 'seen', 'day', 'perspective', 'film', 'buff', 'even', 'casual', 'one', 'instructive', 'educational', 'Others', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'concerned', 'film', 'techniques', 'storytelling', 'methods', 'may', 'wonder', 'what', 'fuss', 'about.Part', 'problem', 'when', 'dealing', 'groundbreaking', 'films', ""'Rashomon"", 'unavoidable', 'other', 'filmmakers', 'Altman', 'are', 'going', 'pilfer', 'original', 'as', 'common', 'imitations', 'clues', 'modern', 'viewer', 'already', 'have', 'trouble', 'picking', 'out', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'made', 'first', 'film', 'so', 'unique', 'when', 'pointed', 'out', 'commentaries', 'do', 'find', 'noteworthy', 'Not', 'necessarily', 'compelling', 'not', 'primary', 'reason', 'have', 'watching', 'film.As', 'average', 'member', 'audience', 'story', ""'m"", 'interested', 'fact', 'absorbing', 'stories', 'different', 'outlooks', 'are', 'why', 'seek', 'out', 'foreign', 'films', 'first', 'place', ""'m"", 'looking', 'distinct', 'perspective', 'human', 'condition', 'way', 'told', 'art', 'direction', 'editing', 'important', 'part', 'effective', 'transmission', 'story', 'director', 'audience', 'may', 'even', 'add', 'depth', 'story', 'particular', 'techniques', 'tend', 'lose', 'surprising', 'originality', 'time', 'especially', 'case', 'pioneering', 'often', 'copied', 'directors', 'Kurosawa', 'question', 'still', 'tell', 'compelling', 'story', 'once', 'startling', 'imagary', 'old', 'hat', 'torrential', 'downpour', 'Two', 'men', 'priest', 'woodcutter', 'have', 'taken', 'refuge', 'ruins', 'abandoned', 'gatehouse', 'are', 'joined', 'third', 'boorish', 'ruffian', 'others', 'are', 'horrible', 'mental', 'strain', 'badgers', 'tell', 'trial', 'had', 'recently', 'witnessed', 'four', 'eyewitness', 'accounts', 'murder', 'rape', 'participant', 'account', 'un-reconcilable', 'other', 'unclear', 'anyone', 'telling', 'truth.While', 'on-screen', 'events', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'somewhat', 'daring', '1950', 'America', 'idea', 'people', 'will', 'twist', 'stories', 'suit', 'own', 'temperament', 'needs', 'could', 'hardly', 'have', 'been', 'astonishing', 'Maybe', 'own', 'cynicism', 'way', 'lies', 'trial', 'participants', 'would', 'affect', 'priest', 'woodcutter', 'down', 'existential', 'core', 'unlikely', 'contrived', 'critical', 'favorite', 'won', 'Oscar', '1951', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Language', 'film', 'top', 'ten', 'director', 'favorites', 'currently', 'clear', 'popularity', 'film', 'community', 'evidenced', 'ranking', 'IMDB', 'factors', 'idea', 'film', 'dealt', 'slippery', 'notion', 'truth', 'led', 'expect', 'truly', 'engaging', 'thought-provoking', 'film', 'means', ""'Rashomon"", 'bad', 'movie', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'under-whelmed', 'Kurosawa', 'films', 'would', 'handily', 'recommend', ""'Throne"", 'Blood', ""'Rashomon"", 'intense', 'movie', 'experience', 'even', 'different', 'type', 'movie', ""'d"", 'say', ""'Seven"", 'Samurai', 'also', 'better', 'choice.I', ""'m"", 'glad', 'such', 'films', ""'Rashomon"", 'are', 'still', 'prized', 'print', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'how', 'medium', 'evolved', 'learning', 'film', 'general', 'would', 'be', 'unfair', 'recommend', 'unreservedly', ""'Rashomon"", 'who', 'are', 'not', 'likely', 'appreciate', 'what', 'good', 'film', 'pioneering', 'camera', 'storytelling', 'techniques', 'will', 'probably', 'seem', 'ho-hum', 'today', 'standard', 'Budding', 'auteurs', 'film', 'buffs', 'will', 'find', 'much', 'value', 'looking', 'solely', 'morally', 'mentally', 'challenging', 'content', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'disappointed']",Rashomon VHS

Arguments raged in intellectual and arts circles about whether artists in every medium needed to address these two issues as well as Kurosowa did.  No one argues about that any longer but it is fair to say that any art work that deals with those issues was influenced by this film. The initial set-up is very simple.  A woman is raped and her husband is murdered.  Four different characters then give their versions of what happened.

It felt like he painfully belabored the point and not much else was added to make the plot interesting.

Confused?  This movie has that tendency.  It's basic ""hook"" is that 4 people tell very different versions of the same story, and each time you hear it, your faith in reality is shaken just a little bit.  Even in the end, you won't know left from right, but you'll probably have a grin from ear to ear.Rashamon is a masterpiece because of the utter ease in which all this flows.  This movie often made me wonder just how on earth it was conceived and created in the first place.  The audience is effortlessly introduced to the story as if it were an after-thought, just some gossip between peasants.  A noble samurai and his loving wife are attacked by a ruthless bandit on the highway.  The samurai is tortured and killed, and the wife raped.  Or is that really what happened?  The wild bandit gives a very different version of the story, and then, amazingly enough, the dead samurai speaks through a medium and tells HIS version.  After all three witnesses speak, you don't know who is the villian and who is the hero.And yet, amazingly enough, the movie digs deeper, and one of the peasants tells HIS version of the story, as he witnessed it from behind a bush.  As I sat watching this final telling in utter disbelief, I suddenly thought:  I have just watched the same thing 4 times in a row, and never once was bored!Of course, Toshiro Mifune gives a typically outstanding performance, yet this film is all about Kurosawa, the master director working behind the scenes.  Every shot and edit is in perfect place, nothing the director does undercuts his actors or his story.  There are no harsh angles like in Kubrick, or sappy endings from Spielberg.  Even the strong, general themes from directors like Ford are muted to serve the movie as a whole, complete story.

354565,A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,6303073107,"Christopher Barrett ""Evil Corgi""","[4, 4]","I have been a long time fan of Rashomon.  It is a film based on three short stories by Ryunosuke Akutagawa and directed by Akira Kurosawa.  It was one of the only films he directed for Daiei, and it is arguable the film that catapulted Kurosawa to fame (definitely the film that brought international attention to his talent).  The film was the Grand Prix selection of the Venice International Film Festival and won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film.  Though Seven Samurai is often regarded as his masterpiece (and often regarded as one of - if not THE - greatest film of all time), Rashomon was a success that endures to this day and without that success, Kurosawa's later films may not have ever been realized.Rashomon is interesting because of the broken narrative.  The film is about a rape and murder in the forest and four different accounts of the events of the crime to a tribunal.  The initial scenes are set at a 'Rashomon' gate.  The three characters are a priest, a woodcutter, and a commoner.  The priest and woodcutter recount their recollections to the commoner.  Interestingly, all four accounts might be false.  Kurosawa even stated (in his autobiography - the excerpt is included with this version of the film) that the film is a metaphor for the human spirit.  Regardless of the symbolism, the film is an icon of classic Japanese cinema.About this version.  I have seen the previous Criterion version, and it is very good.  But Kadokawa headed and funded a major restoration of the film in 2008 for re-release in Japan.  Criterion gained the rights to distribute this version in the states.  And I must say that I was blown away by the restoration.  The Blu-Ray is phenomenal.  The viewer can see each stray hair on characters' heads.  Other amazing scenes are the gorgeous forest backdrops, the close ups of the characters under the gate, and one particularly amazing and beautiful scene where the woman is running her hand through a stream.  It's all so clear that I am amazed it was released in 1950.The sound is amazing, but there are a few scenes where the audio track is off so very slightly from the spoken dialogue.  I assume these scenes had to be re-recorded in studio due to ambient sounds (they were all scenes from the gate set).  The music is at its eerie best.Extras are plentiful.  There are several options on the Blu-Ray itself.  There is an interview with Takashi Shimura, though I found this disappointing, sadly.  Another extra on disc is a 60 odd minute documentary with several members of the original crew.  But the best extra is the audio commentary by Donald Richie, which is included on previous versions.  The booklet is nearly identical to the previous Criterion booklet: it includes an excerpt from 'Something Like an Autobiography' as well as the short stories 'Rashomon' and 'The Grove' by Akutagawa.So really, the only true bonuses for this edition over the previous edition are the restoration, the additional Shimura interview, and the mini documentary.  If you are thinking of upgrading to the Blu-Ray then this is a worthy purchase.  If you own the previous DVD version and are thinking of just getting the newer version on DVD, then there really isn't much more you can expect.  If you don't own a previous copy, then either version is worthy.  But the Blu-Ray is the way to appreciate the new restoration.  It's a film that is timeless, and I applaud Kadokawa for spending the time and money on this masterful restoration for the 21st century.Verdict: buy the Blu-Ray regardless of if you own a previous copy, then sell or give away the previous copy.",5,Blu-Ray version = Definitive version,1357430400,"01 6, 2013",2013,3615,"['have', 'been', 'long', 'time', 'fan', 'Rashomon', 'film', 'based', 'three', 'short', 'stories', 'Ryunosuke', 'Akutagawa', 'directed', 'Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'was', 'one', 'only', 'films', 'directed', 'Daiei', 'arguable', 'film', 'catapulted', 'Kurosawa', 'fame', 'definitely', 'film', 'brought', 'international', 'attention', 'talent', 'film', 'was', 'Grand', 'Prix', 'selection', 'Venice', 'International', 'Film', 'Festival', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Film', 'Though', 'Seven', 'Samurai', 'often', 'regarded', 'masterpiece', 'often', 'regarded', 'one', 'not', 'THE', 'greatest', 'film', 'time', 'Rashomon', 'was', 'success', 'day', 'success', 'Kurosawa', 'later', 'films', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'ever', 'been', 'realized.Rashomon', 'interesting', 'broken', 'narrative', 'film', 'rape', 'murder', 'forest', 'four', 'different', 'accounts', 'events', 'crime', 'tribunal', 'initial', 'scenes', 'are', 'set', ""'Rashomon"", 'gate', 'three', 'characters', 'are', 'priest', 'woodcutter', 'commoner', 'priest', 'woodcutter', 'recount', 'recollections', 'commoner', 'Interestingly', 'four', 'accounts', 'might', 'be', 'false', 'Kurosawa', 'even', 'stated', 'autobiography', 'excerpt', 'included', 'version', 'film', 'film', 'metaphor', 'human', 'spirit', 'Regardless', 'symbolism', 'film', 'icon', 'classic', 'Japanese', 'cinema.About', 'version', 'have', 'seen', 'previous', 'Criterion', 'version', 'very', 'good', 'Kadokawa', 'headed', 'funded', 'major', 'restoration', 'film', '2008', 're-release', 'Japan', 'Criterion', 'gained', 'rights', 'distribute', 'version', 'states', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'restoration', 'Blu-Ray', 'phenomenal', 'viewer', 'can', 'see', 'stray', 'hair', 'characters', 'heads', 'Other', 'amazing', 'scenes', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'forest', 'backdrops', 'close', 'ups', 'characters', 'gate', 'one', 'particularly', 'amazing', 'beautiful', 'scene', 'where', 'woman', 'running', 'hand', 'stream', 'so', 'clear', 'am', 'amazed', 'was', 'released', '1950.The', 'sound', 'amazing', 'are', 'few', 'scenes', 'where', 'audio', 'track', 'so', 'very', 'slightly', 'spoken', 'dialogue', 'assume', 'scenes', 'had', 'be', 're-recorded', 'studio', 'due', 'ambient', 'sounds', 'were', 'scenes', 'gate', 'set', 'music', 'eerie', 'best.Extras', 'are', 'plentiful', 'are', 'several', 'options', 'Blu-Ray', 'interview', 'Takashi', 'Shimura', 'found', 'disappointing', 'sadly', 'extra', 'disc', '60', 'odd', 'minute', 'documentary', 'several', 'members', 'original', 'crew', 'best', 'extra', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Donald', 'Richie', 'included', 'previous', 'versions', 'booklet', 'nearly', 'identical', 'previous', 'Criterion', 'booklet', 'excerpt', ""'Something"", 'Autobiography', 'as', 'well', 'short', 'stories', 'Grove', 'Akutagawa.So', 'really', 'only', 'true', 'bonuses', 'edition', 'previous', 'edition', 'are', 'restoration', 'additional', 'Shimura', 'interview', 'mini', 'documentary', 'are', 'thinking', 'upgrading', 'Blu-Ray', 'then', 'worthy', 'purchase', 'own', 'previous', 'DVD', 'version', 'are', 'thinking', 'just', 'getting', 'newer', 'version', 'DVD', 'then', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'more', 'can', 'expect', 'do', ""n't"", 'own', 'previous', 'copy', 'then', 'version', 'worthy', 'Blu-Ray', 'way', 'appreciate', 'new', 'restoration', 'film', 'timeless', 'applaud', 'Kadokawa', 'spending', 'time', 'money', 'masterful', 'restoration', '21st', 'century.Verdict', 'buy', 'Blu-Ray', 'regardless', 'own', 'previous', 'copy', 'then', 'sell', 'give', 'away', 'previous', 'copy']",Rashomon VHS
354566,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,6303073107,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[0, 0]","Akira Kurosawa had been a filmmaker for almost a decade, since his 1943 debut film Sugata Sanshiro, and had some renown in his native Japan, when, in 1950, his film Rashomon rocketed him to international acclaim, including the Academy Award For Best Foreign Film, after winning the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival brought the film and its director, and Japanese cinema, a Western audience. He deserved every plaudit he received for it, as well as every ticket sold, because it is an excellent film. Yes, there are some flaws- minor, such as the all too sunny (literally) ending, and some of the over the top hammy acting of Toshiro Mifune as the bandit Tajomaru, but given what was coming out of Hollywood at the time- mind-numbing musicals and grade B comedies- Kurosawa brought filmmaking style back to an earlier, simpler place, even as he many times over increased the bar for narrative complexity. Given that the film is not even an hour and a half long, the many interpretations of the multifarious actions of the characters are all the more impressive.The story is as familiar as it is simple. The central ostensible narrative concerns the rape of a woman (Machiko Kyo) and the murder of her Samurai husband (Masayuki Mori), both unnamed, in the 11th or 12th Century, in a wooded glen. The main suspect is the notorious bandit Tajomaru (Mifune), yet, the viewer cannot be certain, for never do we get a single unbiased version of the events that transpire. All three of the main characters tell self-serving versions of the story of how the lady was raped and the Samurai murdered....The film does stretch real reality, a bit, in that while it is well known that minor differences crop up in people's versions of singular events, such glaring inconsistencies as whether or not the Samurai died of a knife or sword wound are implausible, even given the film's setting. But, we allow for this dramatic license because the resonance of the tale's moral is so profound, as well the fact that Kurosawa does not cop out by giving us a `real' authoritative version. That said, the end of the film, after the differing tales of the crime have been discussed thoroughly by the woodcutter, priest, and commoner, Kurosawa seems to stumble, as if he did not have a really good way to end the film. The commoner hears a baby, who's been abandoned at the temple. He steals its blanket, and the priest and woodcutter try to stop him, claiming him evil. He responds by implying that the abandoning parents were evil, and that the woodcutter is a liar, and possible killer. Off into the rain he goes, with his booty. The priest and woodcutter stand with the child until the rain breaks and the sun emerges. The woodcutter offers to take the babe as his own, that he has six children already, and another mouth will hardly matter. The priest feels that his optimism about life and mankind, so tested by the events he has seen, is reaffirmed by the woodcutter's generous offer, and the sun shines through the clouds. That such a terrifically subtle and ambiguous film ends so tritely (the emergent sun and abandoned and rescued baby are a simply awful and heavy-handed use of symbolism), and preachily, reminded me of the greatly disappointing ending that Fyodor Dostoevsky tacked on to Crime And Punishment, in his two terrible epilogues that hammer the book's themes into a reader's head, for he distrusted his own book's ability to convey those themes. The visual and musical aspects of the film's ends do much to mitigate the narrative drop to the floor Crime And Punishment bears, and Rashomon is still a great film, partly because its ending is not as bad as Crime And Punishment's, and partly because it reaches greater artistic heights, and dares more conventions, than Dostoevsky's novel. Still, there's no excuse for its veer from even greater heights, even if the last few minutes are not the heart of the film.While all the actors are wonderful, too much attention has been given to Toshiro Mifune's loony overacting (sometimes a necessity for the comic and divergent elements to emerge) as the bandit. Yes, this film made him a star, but the best performance in the film is by Masayuki Mori, already a major film and stage star in Japan. His is a far less showy role than Mifune's, but he conveys the slight differences all the versions the others tell with none of the easy visual pyrotechnics Mifune's almost boobish bandit is allowed. The raising of an eyebrow can mean the difference between truth and lie, and Mori is expert at walking the line between those ends. Machiko Kyo, as the wife, is the least notable performer.This motto of the film is not only true, but so powerfully true that the term Rashomon Effect was coined to signify the differing perceptions of individuals over singular events, and has been used in both psychological and jurisprudential venues. Ultimately, the film is about even more than the difficulties of interpreting reality and truth, but about how and why they swerve under the force of mere human egoism. Of course, the beauty of the film really lies in the fact that all of its viewers think it's about something other than what it may ultimately be about, which only recapitulates the internal characters' dilemmas, further binding us emotionally in their angst, making us feel what they live. In this empathy Kurosawa cinches and twists that bind, and we are turned from mere percipients into purveyors of an art and reality for our own selves that we, unfortunately, too rarely experience.",4,"Great, but end bombs",1221523200,"09 16, 2008",2008,5540,"['Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'had', 'been', 'filmmaker', 'almost', 'decade', '1943', 'debut', 'film', 'Sugata', 'Sanshiro', 'had',

354567,AUHG8KSHI529U,6303073107,Craig Matteson,"[3, 5]","Yes, this is a very important and influential movie, but it is also fascinating to watch.  Made more than fifty years ago, only five years after the end of World War II, it holds up extremely well and even without understanding all or even most of the things in the movie that speak directly to Japanese culture.  The movie challenges us by providing us a sense of reality and then undermining our certainty.  At the end of the movie it is common for a viewer to think that there is no independent reality, that reality is simply a personal construct and that all our personal ""stories"" are simply lies.  That is indeed a very twentieth century post-modern college sophomore lesson to derive from it.The story opens with two men sitting forlornly at the ruined Rashomon (Dragon gate) outside twelfth century Kyoto.  It is pouring rain and they keep muttering that they don't understand, they don't believe what they have recently been through.  An unnamed man, obviously a poor and very cynical individual, joins them inside the structure to get out of the rain.  He breaks off pieces of the structure to make a fire and, overhearing the muttering, and asks the men to tell what it is they don't understand.The woodcutter tells how he went into the woods to get the firewood he sells and came upon a body and ran to get the police.  We learn that the other man is a priest and his encounter with the man and his wife before they met the bandit.  The woodcutter then recounts the trial of a bandit. Tajomaru (Mifune) and his testimony of how he came to kill the man and rape his wife.  After the testimony we think we have the story.  However, they then bring in the wife who has been found hiding out.  She tells a completely different story including the statement that SHE killed her husband.The dead man testifies through a woman who evokes his spirit.  She becomes possessed and recounts what he knows about his death.  He doesn't know who killed him or who removed the weapon.  The cynical man senses something is wrong with the woodcutter's story and challenges him to tell what really happened.  We then get another very different version.There is much more to the story than this broad outline, but I don't want to take away from your viewing pleasure.There is a very interesting commentary on the disk by Donald Richie, an authority on the films of Kurosawa.  He sounds a lot like a professor teaching undergraduates driving home the same points multiple times.  One of them is that every one of the speakers has his or her own story and that each is true for them and that there is no other truth to know.This is clearly a lesson you could learn from the film, but that would be like learning you can never get a pepperoni and mushroom pizza because the driver delivered a ham and pineapple pizza instead.  It may well be that there is no perfect or Platonic Ideal pepperoni and mushroom pizza.  Some may have more pepperoni than others, others may use different kinds of mushrooms.  What is pizza anyway?  Yet, when I give you a pizza, you know if it is pepperoni and mushroom or something else, right?As for the impossibility of reconciling these stories, well, we have forensics nowadays.  Even before scientific analysis, intelligent folks could and did compare the various testimonies given and then did some analysis to come up with a more likely scenario that is different than any individual testimony.  It will also likely be incomplete and wrong in details, but will reveal more than accepting only one version or none.It is also important to remember that the testimonies recounted here are also not direct, but are also recounted by the woodcutter even though we see them as if they were direct accounts.  So, there is another level of potential distortion.  And it is clear that everyone here is indeed bearing false witness.  This is a very different thing than a person who is trying to provide a truthful account, but is limited by the human condition and is only able to provide a partially complete version (even with errors).  This kind of error is quite different than a conscious lie that is meant to deceive.  The person telling a real lie often understands how their story differs from reality because they are calculating their distortion to be believable but deceptive.  It may be that they eventually commit so strongly to the lie that they forget reality, but others can still get closer to what really happened than accepting the lie at face value and shrugging one's shoulders saying, ""Well, what can you do.  It is his reality.""Anyway, this is a fascinating and important film.

The image of a half-destroyed Japan as represented by the half-destroyed Rashomon gate appears in the opening scene.  Beneath it, several people find shelter in the undestroyed portion, and as the rain forms them into a group, they seek to understand why a terrible crime has occurred.  Rashomon opened to Japanese audiences in 1950, about four years after the Emperor spoke to his nation and ended the war.Watch carefully as Kurosawa takes his audience through the process of understanding.  We never get to the truth of the actual events of the murder, and that was the experience of the Japanese public regarding their country and WWII.  Instead, like their truths, the truth seen by the Rashomon audience is distorted through viewpoints.  The warrior class samurai-turned-bandit knows he'll be blamed, and then recounts the episode with self-aggrandizing machismo in true kamakazi fashion.  The cleric did accurately recall the deceased's weaponry in type and number and didn't see the woman's face.  The woman says she can't remember if she's responsible, but we all know she herself was a victim.  The dead man, who speaks to us through a medium, claims responsibility for his own death, and thereby absolves the living -- almost.  Later we learn that the woodcutter, the average Japanese worker, saw the whole thing and did nothing to stop it.  That, as it turns out, is the most horrible crime of all.The movie concludes at the Rashomon gate, where we are left with the guilt of the average Japanese citizen for failing to stop the warlords, and a priest.  We then discover that in the half-destroyed structure, there is now someone else, an orphan.  The skies clear and the woodcutter, who already has six children, insists that the priest allow him to take the baby.

Perhaps that was a shocking consideration in 1950.  Nowadays, erg, it seems trivial.  Add to that that the acting was often silly and overdone in a big way (seemed more like Kabuki than film), the silent film-esque sort of vibe got tedious, and the music grated on me after a certain point.All that said, perhaps this film was a mind-blower sixty years ago, but I can't help but think that the Wizard of Oz seems a hundred times more modern than this and came out 11 years earlier.",2,A Dud,1294531200,"01 9, 2011",2011,674,"['Okay', 'interesting', 'point', 'people', 'who', 'experience', 'witness', 'crime', 'life', 'experience', 'can', 'have', 'different', 'points', 'view', 'perspectives', 'truth', 'can', 'be', 'relative', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'shocking', 'consideration', '1950', 'erg', 'trivial', 'Add', 'acting', 'was', 'often', 'silly', 'overdone', 'big', 'way', 'seemed', 'more', 'Kabuki', 'film', 'silent', 'film-esque', 'sort', 'vibe', 'got', 'tedious', 'music', 'grated', 'certain', 'point.All', 'said', 'perhaps', 'film', 'was', 'mind-blower', 'sixty', 'years', 'ago', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'hundred', 'times', 'more', 'modern', 'came', 'out', '11', 'years', 'earlier']",Rashomon VHS
354570,A2GYX971VETQBV,6303073107,Daniel R. Sanderman,"[4, 5]","First of all, let me just say this: if you are not a fan of Japanese films, Kurosawa, or ""Samurai"" flicks in general, you owe it to yourself to see RASHOMON and change your opinion.  It is a gorgeous film visually, emotionally powerful, and is short enough to keep even the most impatient filmgoer content.  The plot is deceptively simple: a heinous crime has been committed in the dream-like landscape of the forest.  A samurai has been found dead in the woods and his wife raped.  What unfolds is four different ""versions"" of what happened, told by each of the persons involved in the incident.Many viewers have complained about the lack of objective truth in the film.  They do not want four ""versions"" of the story.  They want the truth.  Some viewers expect this film to be a murder/mystery, a ""whodunit"" film.  ""So who actually killed the samurai?"" they ask.  But the film is not about discovering who, nor is it concerned with figuring out the objective truth.  If anything, Kurosawa's film cares about humanity's inability to experience life unfiltered from our subjective viewpoints.  The result: a statement that there is, perhaps, no such thing as objective truth.  RASHOMON seems to be interested in the way that each of us experiences and observes the world differently by enlarging and distorting the role that we play in various events.  Each of the initial three storytellers claims to be responsible for the crime, suggesting how we each ""personalize"" reality to provide ourselves with meaning and understanding.  The effect is marvelous.Realism looms large in the film.  From their own viewpoint, our samurai warriors are the paragons of bravery and military excellence.  Yet, from a different viewpoint, they are both examples of cowardice, yielding one of the most truthful and honest swordfighting sequences I have ever seen.  I'm talking about a sequence in which people get exhausted (fighting is tough) and are afraid to die.  Few films manage to capture life with such a purity.The visual cinematography in this film is absolutely stunning.  The film begins with a dreary rain sequence in which the audience is invited under a shelter with some of its principle characters.  The rest of the film flashes back and forth in time between the crime and the dreary rain.  The contrast of the downpour with the ""dreamlike"" forest is effective and disturbing.  The forest sequence, which soon follows the opening, finds our principle storyteller walking into the woods, as if to symbolize a journey to another reality.  The camera work in the woods is phenomenal and we get to witness several new techniques being tried out: shooting directly at the sun through the leaves of trees, casting dark (false) shadows from fake trees on the characters' faces, and one long-rail shot that, for its time period, is light years ahead of its time.  The trial sequence is also unique and interesting.  Rather than show us who is doing the questioning, instead we just get to hear the witnesses' side of the investigation.  Moreover, the witnesses speak directly into the camera, giving the film the feel that they are confessing their story to us, the audience.RASHOMON is a brilliant film and I believe it holds up to Kurosawa's THE SEVEN SAMURAI, often regarded as his masterpiece.

When it won various awards around the world, including the Academy award for best foreign film, the reaction was one of some surprise.  Now, over 50 years later, Rashomon stands as a benchmark in cinema, a film that has been copied and ripped off countless times, but never duplicated.  The camera work, storytelling, script, and setting are flawless, giving us the proper mood right from the start.The start is a torrential rainstorm, where several men sit around discussing a trial they have either witnessed, or taken part in.  The trial concerns the murder of a samurai and the rape of his wife, apparantly at the hands of a famous bandit (played by Toshiro Mifune, a Kurasawa favorite).  The story of what actually happened is told through the point of view of the bandit, the woman, the dead man (through a spriritual medium) and a woodcutter who was there and now is standing with these men at the beginning of the film.The interesting thing is that we as the audience are left to assume what really happened, as the film gives no definitive solution.  The subject is really the nature of man, and how point of view will change the perception of a scenario to favor or in some cases, cast a negative light on events that transpire.This was the first film to shoot directly at the sun.  In fact, the beginning shot of the woodcutter traveling into the woods to cut lumber is breathtaking, the camera weaves in and out, up and down, through branches and leaves, showing just how far out of the way these things will be happening.  The excellent DVD has a feature on the camera work, which you will find interesting and will help you when you go back to the film for a second viewing.Also included with the disc is a booklet with the two short stories Kurasawa used as the premise for the film (most notably &quot;In the Grove&quot;)along with an excerpt from Kurasawa's book about the shooting of the film and the apprehension of the Japanese film companies about the fact that the story seemed to have no good ending.  Kurasawa explained that the story was not about the solution of the murder as it was about the nature of man.Film fans need to see this movie.  So many movies made in the last few years (Snake Eyes, The Usual Suspects) owe themselves to Rashomon, movies which show us points of view that are not necessarily the truth.  The fact is that four people can see a situation but report it four completely different ways.  What's the truth?

354572,A34U6WKGEO82P2,6303073107,"Denis Benchimol Minev ""Amazonia""","[1, 1]","The film Rashomon is a pure classic. The acting and plot twists make this a truly enjoyable movie to watch for everyone from film students to casual viewers. When you start watching the classics, you start to realize that modern film is built off of classic film like this. Truly, Akira Kurosawa's much revered movie has become a model off which countless other movies have been made. Overall, the film is enjoyable to watch, and the storytelling is superb, especially when taken in perspective with modern film. The structure of the story is one which has been copied in many movies, even those which are quite famous.What makes Rashomon notable, besides the fact that it was made in 1950 in Japan, well before the modern convention was used in most films, is that is uses a non-linear approach to the tale. Instead of having a static protagonist and setting, the same story is told from many points of view. In Rashomon, there are four main perspectives from which the same story is told. The event which the story revolves around is a rape and murder. However, just as in real life, the truth about what really happened is not as clear as we would like.The movie is full of action which keeps most viewers entertained, but it is also home to a stunning story of truth, justice, and consequences. The director, Kurosawa, focuses on the difficulty in knowing what human nature is really like, as it goes through the different perspectives of the characters in the story. The picture is better because background information about the film indicates that the director's favorite actor, Toshiro Mifune, plays the lead role. This unity is obvious throughout the film which is a work of art.",5,UNIQUE CLASSIC,1295308800,"01 18, 2011",2011,1688,"['film', 'Rashomon', 'pure', 'classic', 'acting', 'plot', 'twists', 'make', 'truly', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'watch', 'everyone', 'film', 'students', 'casual', 'viewers', 'When', 'start', 'watching', 'classics', 'start', 'realize', 'modern', 'film', 'built', 'classic', 'film', 'Truly', 'Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'much', 'revered', 'movie', 'become', 'model', 'countless', 'other', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'Overall', 'film', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'storytelling', 'superb', 'especially', 'when', 'taken', 'perspective', 'modern', 'film', 'structure', 'story', 'one', 'been', 'copied', 'many', 'movies', 'even', 'are', 'quite', 'famous.What', 'Rashomon', 'notable', 'fact', 'was', 'made', '1950', 'Japan', 'well', 'modern', 'convention', 'was', 'used', 'most', 'films', 'non-linear', 'approach', 'tale', 'Instead', 'having', 'static', 'protagonist', 'setting', 'same', 'story', 'told', 'many', 'points', 'view', 'Rashomon', 'are', 'four', 'main', 'perspectives', 'same', 'story', 'told', 'event', 'story', 'around', 'rape', 'murder', 'However', 'just', 'real', 'life', 'truth', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'not', 'as', 'clear', 'would', 'like.The', 'movie', 'full', 'action', 'most', 'viewers', 'entertained', 'also', 'home', 'stunning', 'story', 'truth', 'justice', 'consequences', 'director', 'Kurosawa', 'difficulty', 'knowing', 'what', 'human', 'nature', 'really', 'like', 'different', 'perspectives', 'characters', 'story', 'picture', 'better', 'background', 'information', 'film', 'director', 'favorite', 'actor', 'Toshiro', 'Mifune', 'lead', 'role', 'unity', 'obvious', 'film', 'work', 'art']",Rashomon VHS
354573,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,6303073107,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[3, 4]","As the week of Akira Kurosawa's 100th birthday celebration has came and past, I decided that it was appropriate to watch a Kurosawa film and what best than a film he created 50 years ago, ""Rashomon"".  A film written and directed by Akira Kurosawa and based on two stories ""Rashomon"" and ""In a Grove"" by Ryunosuke Akutagawa and featuring cinematography by Kazuo Miyagawa.Many consider ""Rashomon"" to be the first film that American and Western audiences were exposed to a Kurosawa film and with the film winning an Italian Critics Award and the highly coveted Golden Lion award at the Venice Film Festival and an Academy Honorary Award, there was quite a bit of interest in the film.  Needless to say, the film was an influence to many filmmakers and even received a loosely-based remake in 1964 titled ""The Outrage"" starring Paul Newman.VIDEO & AUDIO:""Rashomon"" is presented in black and white (1:33:1).  It is important to note that the film has received major restoration in Japan by Kadokawa and the version featured by Criterion Collection on DVD as released years before the restoration was completed.  But the version shown on the DVD is good for a 50-year-old film and has its share of dust and specks but at the time of this DVD's release, the Criterion Collection did feature the film with a new HD digital transfer and restored image.The transfer was created from a 35mmm fine-grain master positive on a high definition Spirit Datacine.  The MTI Digital Restoration was used to remove thousands of instances of dirt, debris and scratches.Some scenes look very good such as closeups where we can see the beads of sweat on the characters.  But also various cuts during the forest and in many ways, Kurosawa's admiration for silent film is used in ""Rashomon"" as there are minimal sets and  kept things simple.  Also, the film utilized really technological uses of contrasting shots courtesy of cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa.With the Criterion Collection dedicated in releasing Kurosawa's films on Blu-ray, fans can only hope that this new restored version of ""Rashomon"" will be considered for Blu-ray release sometime in the near future.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:Audio for ""Rashomon"" is presented in Dolby Digital Monaural.  Dialogue is primarily center channel driven but for a more immersive soundscape, I chose to watch ""Rashomon"" via my receiver set on stereo on all channels.  According to the Criterion Collection, the HD transfer of the film includes restored sound.According to the Criterion Collection, the MTI Digital Restoration System was used to remove thousands of instances of dirt, debris and scratches.  The soundtrack was mastered at 24-bit from the original audio magnetic tracks.  Audio restoration tools were used to remove clicks, pops, hiss and crackle.It is important to note that the main Japanese soundtrack is included but also the original English dubbed soundtrack.  Personally, I didn't watch much of the film with the English soundtrack as it was very reminiscent to watching old Kung Fu, Shaw Brothers films in the early '80s.  But for those who can't stand subtitles, at least they have the option to select an English dubbed soundtrack.Subtitles are in English.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Rashomon - THE CRITERION COLLECTION #138' comes with the following special features:* Audio Commentary by Donald Richie - Film historian Donald Richie provides the commentary of ""Rashomon"".  As a film critic well-versed in Japanese cinema, Richie goes into depth about the filmmaking of the film.* Video Introduction by Robert Altman - (6:39) Filmmaker Robert Altman (""Mash"", ""Shortcuts"", ""Gosford Park"") talks about his love for the film and Kurosawa's symbolic use of light.* Excerpts from ""The World of Kazuo Miyagawa"" - (12:32) A Japanese documentary (with English subtitles) based on Akira Kurosawa's longtime cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa who talks about working with Akira Kurosawa and gives viewers insight to the director and the their professional relationship.  Most importantly, the techniques used to film ""Rashomon"".* Trailer - (3:27) The original theatrical trailer for ""Rashomon"".* 28-Page Booklet - Featuring the an essay on ""Rashomon"" by Stephen Prince (Author of ""The Warrior's Camera: The Cinema of Akira Kurosawa""), ""Akira Kurosawa on Rashomon"" (from ""Something Like an Autobiography) and excerpts from Ryunosuke Akutagawa's ""Rashomon"" and ""In a Grove"" novel (both translated in English).JUDGMENT CALL:I first watched ""Rashomon"" while I was a young college student and was very surprised by how the film was much different from ""The Seven Samurai"", especially when it came to the number of characters featured, the emotion of the characters especially the crazy Tajomaru and also taken aback by the reaction of the samurai's wife Masako.Needless to say, the concept of seeing flashbacks and finding out that these flashbacks were either truth or fabrications, one can't deny of how this film captures your attention as you want to know who committed the crime.I was impressed how Kurosawa was able to film ""Rashomon"" despite receiving a low budget and keeping things to a minimalist set.  Just to see how the camerawork came about, how meticulous the editing was since Kurosawa likes to shoot a scene with several cameras and of course, the character performances which were quite important in the development of the film.  In fact, prior to the film, the actors and staff lived together temporarily and it was a system which Kurosawa felt worked in bringing harmony to the set.As mentioned, there has been restoration done on ""Rashomon"" with the source material being extremely in bad condition despite the 35mm print from 1962 being in very good physical condition.  So, each scene was digitally restored and cleaned up courtesy of the Academy Film Archive, the National Film Center of the National Museum of Modern Art in Tokyo and Kadokawa Pictures, Inc.  The film has been shown throughout the world in 2009 and one can hope that with Kurosawa's films making it to Blu-ray, the Criterion Collection considers the new restored version of ""Rashomon"" for Blu-ray release.But for now, those who find ""Rashomon"" can be content with the Criterion Collection's DVD release for now.  A good number of special features, solid picture and audio quality as one can expect from a 50-year-old film on DVD and an informative booklet and a few bonus features included.  ""Rashomon"" is definitely a Kurosawa masterpiece worth watching and having in your collection.",5,A wonderful AK DVD from Criterion!

354574,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,6303073107,Dennis Littrell,"[2, 2]","In the Bible, Pilate asks, ""What is truth?"" and, as Roger Bacon puts it, ""would not stay for an answer.""I felt a bit the same way after seeing this remarkable film by Japan's celebrated film maker, Akira Kurosawa.  It is set in 12th century Japan, and while most viewers would say it examines the nature of truth and finds it slippery, I think it more properly examines the nature of the feudal Japanese society.We have as representatives of that society, a priest (Minuru Chiaki) and a woodcutter (Takashi Shimura) sitting out a rain storm in a place called Rashomon.  It might pass for a ruined Greek temple except that its pillars and roof are made of wood.  The priest and the woodcutter declare that they just can't understand it.  They shake their heads and stare at the ground.  Along comes a commoner (Kichijiro Uedo), a cynical man who asks what it is that they cannot understand.They have witnessed an investigation into the death of a samurai, Takehiro (Masayuki Mori).  He is in some ways the equivalent of a medieval knight.  He has a horse and lady, Masako (Machiko Kyo).  The accused is an infamous outlaw named Tajomaru (played brilliantly by Toshiro Mifune, who obviously had a lot of fun with the part).  He tells his story.  He admits to having his way with the lady, but lets the court know that she liked it so much that she began to embrace him while her husband was tied up watching.  Afterwards he says that she insisted that they fight over her.  Tajomaru obliges.  He cuts the rope holding Takehiro and they sword fight.  Tajomaru wins.Next the wife tells her story.  It is different of course.  This causes the court to get a medium (Fumiko Honma) to tell the story from the point of view of the dead Takehiro.  His story is different yet again.  Finally the woodcutter reveals to the priest and the commoner that he saw the whole thing, and he then gives his version, again different of course.The commoner has some terrifically cynical lines.  Here are three:""It's human to lie. Most of the time we can't even be honest with ourselves.""(To the priest:) ""Not another sermon! I don't mind a lie if it's interesting.""""Man just wants to forget the bad stuff, and believe in the made-up good stuff. It's easier that way.""He speaks for the natural or animalistic man.His counterpoint, the priest, opines, ""If men don't trust each other, this earth might as well be hell.""He speaks for moral man.Near the end of the film a baby is discovered crying.  The woodcutter, who has five or six children of his own, takes the baby home.He represents civilized man.Masako represents the samurai's view of the nature of women when she is heard to say, ""A man has to make a woman his by his sword.""What impressed me most about this film is the way Kurosawa was able to create an emotional atmosphere in each of the sittings.  ""In the Grove"" we feel the trees and the light that sparkles through the leaves, and the disturbed serenity.  At Rashomon in the rain we feel the men isolated and waiting, and in the sterile court scene we feel the severity of the tragedy.",5,Required viewing at most film schools,1176163200,"04 10, 2007",2007,3076,"['Bible', 'Pilate', 'What', 'truth', 'Roger', 'Bacon', 'would', 'not', 'stay', 'answer', 'felt', 'bit', 'same', 'way', 'seeing', 'remarkable', 'film', 'Japan', 'celebrated', 'film', 'maker', 'Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'set', '12th', 'century', 'Japan', 'most', 'viewers', 'would', 'say', 'nature', 'truth', 'slippery', 'think', 'more', 'properly', 'nature', 'feudal', 'Japanese', 'society.We', 'have', 'representatives', 'society', 'priest', 'Minuru', 'Chiaki', 'woodcutter', 'Takashi', 'Shimura', 'sitting', 'out', 'rain', 'storm', 'place', 'called', 'Rashomon', 'might', 'pass', 'ruined', 'Greek', 'temple', 'pillars', 'roof', 'are', 'made', 'wood', 'priest', 'woodcutter', 'declare', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'shake', 'heads', 'stare', 'ground', 'Along', 'commoner', 'Kichijiro', 'Uedo', 'cynical', 'man', 'who', 'what', 'can', 'not', 'understand.They', 'have', 'witnessed', 'investigation', 'death', 'samurai', 'Takehiro', 'Masayuki', 'Mori', 'ways', 'equivalent', 'medieval', 'knight', 'horse', 'lady', 'Masako', 'Machiko', 'Kyo', 'accused', 'infamous', 'outlaw', 'named', 'Tajomaru', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Toshiro', 'Mifune', 'who', 'obviously', 'had', 'lot', 'fun', 'part', 'story', 'having', 'way', 'lady', 'court', 'know', 'liked', 'so', 'much', 'began', 'embrace', 'husband', 'was', 'tied', 'up', 'watching', 'Afterwards', 'insisted', 'fight', 'Tajomaru', 'rope', 'holding', 'Takehiro', 'sword', 'fight', 'Tajomaru', 'wife', 'story', 'different', 'course', 'court', 'get', 'medium', 'Fumiko', 'Honma', 'tell', 'story', 'point', 'view', 'dead', 'Takehiro', 'story', 'different', 'yet', 'again', 'Finally', 'woodcutter', 'reveals', 'priest', 'commoner', 'saw', 'whole', 'thing', 'then', 'version', 'again', 'different', 'course.The', 'commoner', 'terrifically', 'cynical', 'lines', 'Here', 'are', 'three', 'human', 'lie', 'Most', 'time', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'be', 'honest', 'priest', 'Not', 'sermon', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'lie', 'interesting', 'Man', 'just', 'forget', 'bad', 'stuff', 'believe', 'made-up', 'good', 'stuff', 'easier', 'way', 'natural', 'animalistic', 'man.His', 'counterpoint', 'priest', 'opines', 'men', 'do', ""n't"", 'trust', 'other', 'earth', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'hell', 'moral', 'man.Near', 'end', 'film', 'baby', 'discovered', 'crying', 'woodcutter', 'who', 'five', 'six', 'children', 'own', 'baby', 'home.He', 'civilized', 'man.Masako', 'samurai', 'view', 'nature', 'women', 'when', 'heard', 'say', 'man', 'make', 'woman', 'sword', 'What', 'impressed', 'most', 'film', 'way', 'Kurosawa', 'was', 'able', 'create', 'emotional', 'atmosphere', 'sittings', 'Grove', 'feel', 'trees', 'light', 'leaves', 'disturbed', 'serenity', 'Rashomon', 'rain', 'feel', 'men', 'isolated', 'waiting', 'sterile', 'court', 'scene', 'feel', 'severity', 'tragedy']",Rashomon VHS
354575,A21279TEPJ8YJ9,6303073107,"Diaspora Chic ""diaspora_chic""","[2, 2]","Akira Kurosawa's highly acclaimed film Rashomon isn't about who did it or why it was done. It is more about the who is telling the truth about a samurai's killing. Did the bandit really kill him? Or did he commit suicide? Is the woodcutter's story more true than ones dictated by the bandit, the samurai's wife, and the samurai himself? The viewer will never know the events that lead to the tragic death of the samurai.The movie in itself is interesting to watch because, as the commoner said, a lie can sometimes be entertaining. As is today with the tabloids and reality television, it is more interesting to hear what is not true than what isn't true. And that is where humans become confused, lost, and sometimes angry. Akira Kurosawa is very indepth with human emotion. The rain symbolizes the emotion that can be drained from people when they have lost faith in others and themselves. The sun is a reflection of what is expected to come when people go on about their business.But in the end, there is always a new beginning for hope and faith.

This can be watched in a group  or at a party and great discussion will result, maybe with some Saki to  mellow the differences.There is an actor who walks into the scene at  the beginning, wanders around and seems to set the stage for the four  stories.

354577,A2TWIZ33KJCQ54,6303073107,"Dr. Luther Wolfgang Polaris ""LWP""","[13, 14]","Rashomon still contains hope that humankind on planet Earth may be a sort of ""WORK-IN-PROGRESS"".FIRST OFF - This is the film where numerous perspectives/viewpoints of the same event illustrate rather persuasively how [literally] there are often two or more sides to most stories. The central event in this story has been the basis of many similar themes since. The Roshomon knock-off that is the most fun to watch and most illuminating to me is probably an episode of ""All IN THE FAMILY"" titled, ""EVERYBODY TELLS THE TRUTH"". Of course, Archie Bunker does not deal in subtlety, so it is an interesting and comical take on the Roshomon theme.Another similar treatment, but this time a drama, is on the big screen and features Paul Newman, ""The Outrage"", from 1964, with William Shatner, Lawrence Harvey and Claire Bloom as co-stars. This film is hard to find, but well worth the effort.RAMBLING ON ABOUT ""RASHOMON"":This film is NOT an easy thing to watch. In English it is somewhat less effective and in Japanese one must contend with the subtitles. Still, I suggest the Japanese with subtitles. Be aware, however, that this is a highly visual film so avoid getting bogged down in the subtitles. More than any other film I have seen, ""Rashomon"" shows rather than tells, so be prepared to pay very close attention to seemingly small details. Like Kubrick, everything you see and the way you see it has been reduced or altered to be just what is needed for the story. In essence, this is a rather stark though epic production and it may take a few viewings to truly appreciate ""Rashomon's"" true splendor and significance. It is a short movie that I wished was longer though I was quite satisfied with the ending.WHAT THIS FILM IS ABOUT: [Without giving away the plot of course.]HOPE! Through the re-enactment of some perceptional permutations and nuances of a tragic event we are almost left with the conclusion that human beings are fatally-flawed, evil, weak beings fueled by lust and driven with selfish motives and little else.THE MESSAGE OF HOPE:But then there is a ray of hope in the form of a helpless abandoned infant and what follows. What we see is intrinsically-flawed humans that through self-awareness may seek to improve their character. If this is true, maybe then through self-awareness, human flaws may be intrinsic but solvable over time making us flawed but NOT FATALLY FLAWED! Sentience may over time be our deliverance in the form of character and integrity. If this is true, then humans are not naturally depraved and everything may not be preordained. Perhaps we are a kind of ""work-in-progress"". What a nice thought, though Kurosawa gives it to us rather like castor oil.ABOUT THE DVD:This is a Criterion Collection DVD and that speaks for itself. Here, however, the best special feature is the rather large booklet that is included with the DVD. The transfer is excellent for a 55-year-old black and white film and it is in Full Screen Format.LAST THOUGHTS: A FILM THAT MAY NEED TO BE SEE MORE THAN ONCE TO FULLY APPRECIATEALSO RECOMMENDED TO VIEW:--* ""EVERYBODY TELLS THE TRUTH"", ALL IN THE FAMILY - episode 58, 1973--* ""THE OUTRAGE"", Martin Ritt, 1964",5,GROUNDBREAKING FILM THAT INFLUENCED MANY OTHER FILMMAKERS & EVERYDAY PEOPLE TOO,1150416000,"06 16, 2006",2006,3174,"['Rashomon', 'still', 'hope', 'humankind', 'planet', 'Earth', 'may', 'be', 'sort', 'WORK-IN-PROGRESS', 'OFF', 'film', 'where', 'numerous', 'perspectives/viewpoints', 'same', 'event', 'illustrate', 'rather', 'persuasively', 'how', '[', 'literally', ']', 'are', 'often', 'two', 'more', 'sides', 'most', 'stories', 'central', 'event', 'story', 'been', 'basis', 'many', 'similar', 'themes', 'Roshomon', 'knock-off', 'most', 'fun', 'watch', 'most', 'illuminating', 'probably', 'episode', 'IN', 'THE', 'FAMILY', 'titled', 'EVERYBODY', 'TELLS', 'THE', 'TRUTH', 'course', 'Archie', 'Bunker', 'not', 'deal', 'subtlety', 'interesting', 'comical', 'take', 'Roshomon', 'theme.Another', 'similar', 'treatment', 'time', 'drama', 'big', 'screen', 'features', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'Outrage', '1964', 'William', 'Shatner', 'Lawrence', 'Harvey', 'Claire', 'Bloom', 'co-stars', 'film', 'hard', 'find', 'well', 'effort.RAMBLING', 'ON', 'RASHOMON', 'film', 'NOT', 'easy', 'thing', 'watch', 'English', 'somewhat', 'less', 'effective', 'Japanese', 'one', 'must', 'contend', 'subtitles', 'Still', 'suggest', 'Japanese', 'subtitles', 'Be', 'aware', 'however', 'highly', 'visual', 'film', 'so', 'avoid', 'getting', 'bogged', 'down', 'subtitles', 'More', 'other', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'Rashomon', 'rather', 'tells', 'so', 'be', 'prepared', 'pay', 'very', 'close', 'attention', 'seemingly', 'small', 'details', 'Kubrick', 'everything', 'see', 'way', 'see', 'been', 'reduced', 'altered', 'be', 'just', 'what', 'needed', 'story', 'essence', 'rather', 'stark', 'epic', 'production', 'may', 'take', 'few', 'viewings', 'truly', 'appreciate', 'Rashomon', 'true', 'splendor', 'significance', 'short', 'movie', 'wished', 'was', 'longer', 'was', 'quite', 'satisfied', 'ending.WHAT', 'THIS', 'FILM', '[', 'giving', 'away', 'plot', 'course.', ']', 'HOPE', 're-enactment', 'perceptional', 'permutations', 'nuances', 'tragic', 'event', 'are', 'almost', 'left', 'conclusion', 'human', 'beings', 'are', 'fatally-flawed', 'evil', 'weak', 'beings', 'fueled', 'lust', 'driven', 'selfish', 'motives', 'little', 'else.THE', 'MESSAGE', 'HOPE', 'then', 'ray', 'hope', 'form', 'helpless', 'abandoned', 'infant', 'what', 'What', 'see', 'intrinsically-flawed', 'humans', 'self-awareness', 'may', 'seek', 'improve', 'character', 'true', 'maybe', 'then', 'self-awareness', 'human', 'flaws', 'may', 'be', 'intrinsic', 'solvable', 'time', 'making', 'flawed', 'NOT', 'FATALLY', 'FLAWED', 'Sentience', 'may', 'over', 'time', 'be', 'deliverance', 'form', 'character', 'integrity', 'true', 'then', 'humans', 'are', 'not', 'naturally', 'depraved', 'everything', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'preordained', 'Perhaps', 'are', 'kind', 'work-in-progress', 'What', 'nice', 'thought', 'Kurosawa', 'rather', 'castor', 'THE', 'DVD', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'DVD', 'speaks', 'Here', 'however', 'best', 'special', 'feature', 'rather', 'large', 'booklet', 'included', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'excellent', '55-year-old', 'black', 'white', 'film', 'Full', 'Screen', 'Format.LAST', 'THOUGHTS', 'FILM', 'THAT', 'MAY', 'NEED', 'TO', 'BE', 'SEE', 'MORE', 'THAN', 'ONCE', 'TO', 'FULLY', 'APPRECIATEALSO', 'RECOMMENDED', 'TO', 'VIEW', '*', 'EVERYBODY', 'TELLS', 'THE', 'TRUTH', 'ALL', 'IN', 'THE', 'FAMILY', 'episode', '58', '1973', 'OUTRAGE', 'Martin', 'Ritt', '1964']",Rashomon VHS
354578,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,6303073107,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 0]","A man is dead, a woman was raped, and that's all that can be definitely said. Somebody has committed murder, but nobody knows whodunnit. Genius filmmaker Akira Kurosawa's ""Rashomon"" is a classic for its skillful direction, suspense and wonderful acting. It's one of those movies you think must be vastly overrated until you see it, and are blown away by it.At the Rashomon Gate in eleventh-century Japan, a man (Kichijiro Ueda) takes shelter with a priest (Minoru Chiaki) and a woodcutter (Takashi Shimura) during a rainstorm. The woodcutter is depressed and the priest is horrified, over a recent crime: the vicious bandit Tajmaru (Toshir Mifune) was arrested for murdering a man named Takehiro (Masayuki Mori) and raping his wife Masako (Machiko Ky). But when taken before the police, Tajmaru claims that he has his fun with the woman and killed her husband honorably in a fight.But Masako begs to differ; she claims to be the victim first of the sadistic bandit, then of her cold-hearted husband. And when a medium calls up the spirit of Takehiro, he claims that Masako was unfaithful, asking the bandit to murder him, then spurned by Tajmaru. Her actions drove Takehiro to suicide. And the woodcutter himself claims to have seen the altercation -- and his version is wildly different from them all.During the filming of ""Rashomon,"" director Akira Kurosawa stated that the film is a reflection of life, which doesn't always have clear meanings. The same could be said of truth. Questions are raised by the events of ""Rashomon,"" but given no easy answers -- sometimes no answers at all (my biggest question was how Masako's gown stays so white if she's always weeping on the ground).Light and shadow whirl and dance in a frankly beautiful woodland setting, serving as a pretty backdrop for some very ugly acts. The fight scenes are masterful -- they look like real fights, as opposed to choreography. Tajmaru's are more stylized, whereas the woodcutter sees two guys rolling and staggering around with swords, obviously freaked out. Kurosawa was even brave enough to touch on the unique idea of having the deceased testify. The spinechilling seance scene, starring a downright spooky, stark-faced Fumiko Honma, is a haunting classic scene.Are Kurosawa's insights dark and depressing? In a fascinating, hypnotic way... yes. But while calmly pointing out the ability of human beings to lie even to themselves, he acknowledges that there's good in there too (a scene where the woodcutter adopts an abandoned baby as the priest watches). We lose our illusions and innocence as the priest loses his, forced to look on how despicable people can be, but while being comforted with the knowledge that people aren't all bad, and that unadulterated truth isn't really necessary to have good in you.Toshir Mifune chews the scenery with gusto as the barbarian bandit, laughing and jerking like a hyena just to see people jump. At first glance, Machiko Ky seems to be overacting, until you see how unhinged her character has become by whatever happened. Masayuki Mori doesn't get to act as much as the others (the poor guy spends most of his time tied to a tree), but is good when the camera zooms in on him. Minoru Chiaki and Takashi Shimura add an extra dimension as the innocent young priest and the tormented woodcutter.Gloomy, thought-provoking and ultimately quite freaky, ""Rashomon"" still defies conventional filmmaking and will suck you right in. It's brilliantly crafted and exceptionally directed, and must be seen by all lovers of cinema.

354579,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,6303073107,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 3]","Leave it to the Criterion Collection to give Akira Kurosawa's seminal 1950 masterpiece its due with this superb 2002 DVD package. First, renowned Japanese film scholar Donald Richie provides a terrifically insightful commentary as he does on classics of other Japanese genres, Yasujiro Ozu's family drama, ""Early Summer"" (1951), and K Ichiwara's sun-tribe melodrama, ""Crazed Fruit"" (1956). Second, there is a seventeen-minute excerpt about the film from a feature-length documentary about its masterful cinematographer, ""World of Kazuo Miyagawa"", who did similarly amazing work on Kenji Mizoguchi's ""Ugetsu"" (1953) and Ozu's ""Floating Weeds"" (1959). Third, if you choose to buy rather than rent the DVD, there is a beautifully designed booklet with relevant excerpts from Kurosawa's autobiography and the two short stories by Ryunosuke Akutagawa from which Kurosawa and co-writer Shinobu Hashimoto based their screenplay. Add a brief testimonial introduction by Robert Altman, and this becomes one of the best of the Criterion Collection DVDs.Set in feudal 12th-century Japan, it is a far more intimate film than its vaunted reputation leads one to believe and quite brief at 88 minutes. Ostensibly a courtroom drama, the multi-layered story focuses on the rape of a woman and the murder of her husband in a forest grove. The events of the crimes are told from four different perspectives - a swaggering bandit named Tajmaru, a woodcutter who witnesses the crime, the wife and even the murdered husband by way of a medium. Each account unfolds in a distinct style - an extravagant samurai adventure according to Tajmaru, the wife's melodramatic recollection as a victim, a heroic martyr's tale from the dead husband. In a blessedly economical style, the contradictions in their accounts multiply as the story unfolds.The framing device is the woodcutter's own flashback of the incident as told to a commoner, but his version is far from the definitive one as he may have stolen a dagger from the crime scene. Kurosawa does such a brilliantly dexterous job in structuring the differing accounts that as the film progresses, it becomes less about seeking the truth and more about the power and inevitable conflicts arising from everyone's sense of ego. The only thing that becomes clear by the end is how individual perceptions shape reality and that the absolute truth is a myth. Miyagawa's expert camerawork is stellar in a way that raises the bar for subsequent cinema, especially the vivid facial close-ups of the main characters, the sharp angles of the sun-dappled forest scenes, and the dramatically ink-tinted raindrops.A sterling cast has been assembled with Kurosawa's muse, Toshiro Mifune, a youthfully feral presence as Tajmaru. Masayuki Mori and an especially vibrant Machiko Ky, who later reunited in the ghostly ""Ugetsu"", lend particular distinction to the couple ensnared by the tragic situation, and the three legendary actors show impressive versatility in highlighting different aspects of their personalities in the various accounts. Takashi Shimura, who later starred in Kurosawa's poignant ""Ikuru"", is also superb as the woodcutter. Many filmmakers have since copied Kurosawa's then-daring narrative structure (for example, Martin Ritt's ""The Outrage"" and Edward Zwick's ""Courage Under Fire""), but none comes close to capturing the pervasive sense of ambiguity that makes this movie retain its initial power.",5,The Indisputable Kurosawa Masterwork Given Worthy Criterion Treatment,1150416000,"06 16, 2006",2006,3428,"['Leave', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'give', 'Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'seminal', '1950', 'masterpiece', 'due', 'superb', '2002', 'DVD', 'package', 'First', 'renowned', 'Japanese', 'film', 'scholar', 'Donald', 'Richie', 'terrifically', 'insightful', 'commentary', 'classics', 'other', 'Japanese', 'genres', 'Yasujiro', 'Ozu', 'family', 'drama', 'Early', 'Summer', '1951', 'K', 'Ichiwara', 'sun-tribe', 'melodrama', 'Crazed', 'Fruit', '1956', 'Second', 'seventeen-minute', 'excerpt', 'film', 'feature-length', 'documentary', 'masterful', 'cinematographer', 'World', 'Kazuo', 'Miyagawa', 'who', 'did', 'similarly', 'amazing', 'work', 'Kenji', 'Mizoguchi', 'Ugetsu', '1953', 'Ozu', 'Floating', 'Weeds', '1959', 'Third', 'choose', 'buy', 'rather', 'rent', 'DVD', 'beautifully', 'designed', 'booklet', 'relevant', 'excerpts', 'Kurosawa', 'autobiography', 'two', 'short', 'stories', 'Ryunosuke', 'Akutagawa', 'Kurosawa', 'co-writer', 'Shinobu', 'Hashimoto', 'based', 'screenplay', 'Add', 'brief', 'testimonial', 'introduction', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'one', 'best', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'DVDs.Set', 'feudal', '12th-century', 'Japan', 'far', 'more', 'intimate', 'film', 'vaunted', 'reputation', 'one', 'believe', 'quite', 'brief', '88', 'minutes', 'Ostensibly', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'multi-layered', 'story', 'focuses', 'rape', 'woman', 'murder', 'husband', 'forest', 'grove', 'events', 'crimes', 'are', 'told', 'four', 'different', 'perspectives', 'swaggering', 'bandit', 'named', 'Tajmaru', 'woodcutter', 'who', 'crime', 'wife', 'even', 'murdered', 'husband', 'way', 'medium', 'account', 'distinct', 'style', 'extravagant', 'samurai', 'adventure', 'according', 'Tajmaru', 'wife', 'melodramatic', 'recollection', 'victim', 'heroic', 'martyr', 'tale', 'dead', 'husband', 'blessedly', 'economical', 'style', 'contradictions', 'accounts', 'multiply', 'story', 'unfolds.The', 'framing', 'device', 'woodcutter', 'own', 'flashback', 'incident', 'told', 'commoner', 'version', 'far', 'definitive', 'one', 'may', 'have', 'stolen', 'dagger', 'crime', 'scene', 'Kurosawa', 'brilliantly', 'dexterous', 'job', 'structuring', 'differing', 'accounts', 'film', 'less', 'seeking', 'truth', 'more', 'power', 'inevitable', 'conflicts', 'arising', 'everyone', 'sense', 'ego', 'only', 'thing', 'clear', 'end', 'how', 'individual', 'perceptions', 'shape', 'reality', 'absolute', 'truth', 'myth', 'Miyagawa', 'expert', 'camerawork', 'stellar', 'way', 'bar', 'subsequent', 'cinema', 'especially', 'vivid', 'facial', 'close-ups', 'main', 'characters', 'sharp', 'angles', 'sun-dappled', 'forest', 'scenes', 'dramatically', 'ink-tinted', 'raindrops.A', 'sterling', 'cast', 'been', 'assembled', 'Kurosawa', 'muse', 'Toshiro', 'Mifune', 'youthfully', 'feral', 'presence', 'Tajmaru', 'Masayuki', 'Mori', 'especially', 'vibrant', 'Machiko', 'Ky', 'who', 'later', 'reunited', 'ghostly', 'Ugetsu', 'lend', 'particular', 'distinction', 'couple', 'ensnared', 'tragic', 'situation', 'three', 'legendary', 'actors', 'show', 'impressive', 'versatility', 'highlighting', 'different', 'aspects', 'personalities', 'various', 'accounts', 'Takashi', 'Shimura', 'who', 'later', 'starred', 'Kurosawa', 'poignant', 'Ikuru', 'also', 'superb', 'woodcutter', 'Many', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'copied', 'Kurosawa', 'then-daring', 'narrative', 'structure', 'example', 'Martin', 'Ritt', 'Outrage', 'Edward', 'Zwick', 'Courage', 'Fire', 'none', 'close', 'capturing', 'pervasive', 'sense', 'ambiguity', 'movie', 'retain', 'initial', 'power']",Rashomon VHS

354581,A60PQSFWSQK8K,6303073107,Erik Rupp,"[16, 16]","Rashomon was the first movie where Akira Kurosawa really found his filmmaking voice.Visually, Rashomon is stunning.  The techniques used by Kurosawa were years ahead of their time.  The outdoor filming, especially in the forest, gives the film an authenticity that you just can't get on a soundstage.As far as the story goes, there is enough ambiguity to keep people discussing this movie for decades.  Is it about lying?  Distorted memories?  People lying to themselves?  Selfishness?  Or is it about all of the above?Kurosawa's story of a murder told from four different points of view that come across with distinctly different details is captivating.  In the end we still aren't 100% sure exactly what happened, although we have a fairly good idea.  Toshiro Mifune is, as he often is, over the top as the bandit.  But being Toshiro Mifune over the top works extremely well.  It comes across as genuine, and not just hammy acting.  Mifune would take this performance and refine it further in Seven Samurai just four years later.As for the Essential Art House DVD, it is the Criterion version without the extras.  The picture quality is quite good, as the contrast is just about perfect, and the picture has a sharpness and clarity that is very pleasing.  The sound doesn't fare quite so well, as there is a lot of hiss and crackling to be heard, but not so much as to be a deal breaker.  The voices come through clearly, as does the rain and other forest sounds.Why buy this version?  Price.  It is roughly half the cost of the fully loaded Criterion release, so that makes it a lot easier to make the purchase.  Yes, the extras on the full Criterion version are quite good, but if you're on the fence about buying the movie this would be the one to get (especially if price is a major consideration).",5,Groundbreaking Movie: Criterion Version - Without the Extras,1281139200,"08 7, 2010",2010,1804,"['Rashomon', 'was', 'first', 'movie', 'where', 'Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'really', 'found', 'filmmaking', 'voice.Visually', 'Rashomon', 'stunning', 'techniques', 'used', 'Kurosawa', 'were', 'years', 'ahead', 'time', 'outdoor', 'filming', 'especially', 'forest', 'film', 'authenticity', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'soundstage.As', 'far', 'story', 'enough', 'ambiguity', 'keep', 'people', 'discussing', 'movie', 'decades', 'lying', 'Distorted', 'memories', 'People', 'lying', 'Selfishness', 'above', 'Kurosawa', 'story', 'murder', 'told', 'four', 'different', 'points', 'view', 'distinctly', 'different', 'details', 'captivating', 'end', 'still', 'are', ""n't"", '100', '%', 'sure', 'exactly', 'what', 'happened', 'have', 'fairly', 'good', 'idea', 'Toshiro', 'Mifune', 'often', 'top', 'bandit', 'being', 'Toshiro', 'Mifune', 'top', 'extremely', 'well', 'genuine', 'not', 'just', 'hammy', 'acting', 'Mifune', 'would', 'take', 'performance', 'refine', 'further', 'Seven', 'Samurai', 'just', 'four', 'years', 'later.As', 'Essential', 'Art', 'House', 'DVD', 'Criterion', 'version', 'extras', 'picture', 'quality', 'quite', 'good', 'contrast', 'just', 'perfect', 'picture', 'sharpness', 'clarity', 'very', 'pleasing', 'sound', ""n't"", 'fare', 'quite', 'so', 'well', 'lot', 'hiss', 'crackling', 'be', 'heard', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'be', 'deal', 'breaker', 'voices', 'come', 'clearly', 'rain', 'other', 'forest', 'sounds.Why', 'buy', 'version', 'Price', 'roughly', 'cost', 'fully', 'loaded', 'Criterion', 'release', 'lot', 'easier', 'make', 'purchase', 'Yes', 'extras', 'full', 'Criterion', 'version', 'are', 'quite', 'good', ""'re"", 'fence', 'buying', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'get', 'especially', 'price', 'major', 'consideration']",Rashomon VHS
354582,A2F5PAC9I5SCG6,6303073107,Ernest Jagger,"[1, 4]","Or for that matter, what is the truth? Director Akira Kurosawa leaves this for the viewer to decide. As the films narrative moves forward, we all know that a crime has been committed, and more importantly, by whom. So what is Kurosawa out to prove in this masterful film? That everyone has a different view of the truth? Perhaps some of us embellish the truth? Or possibly something altogether different? In Akira Kurosawa's film, ""Rashomon,"" the viewer is introduced various witnesses to the rape of a woman, and the murder of her husband. Why are there different interpretations by the various witnesses to the crime in the film? Are they lying? Or is there a mixture of both lies and truths? Director Akira Kurosawa has left this for the audience to decide. This is a great film, however, I do not believe that it is Kurosawa's greatest film. ""Ikiru,"" holds that distinction---for me at least. ""Rashomon"" has always been one of the most talked about films in Japanese cinema, and many place it amongst the greatest films ever, be it foreign or domestic.This films narrative is an attempt to let the viewer decide who is telling the truth, or why the different characters each have a different interpretation. But why are they all different? There have been many different opinions of this film, and even after all these years since its release, this film has been discussed at length. So what is Kurosawa out to prove? That even the innocent may have something to hide? Or that our perceptions of reality differ? The film starts off with a man that has just testified to a horrible crime. And from here the film begins innocently enough with a woodcutter walking through the woods. This woodcutter is portrayed by the late, great actor, (Takeshi Shimura). He is a witness to a crime. But he is not the only witness. There are four different versions of a murder and rape: the woodcutter, the deceased mans wife, the killer (Toshiro Mifune), and the victim---through the use of a medium.The one thing I was really impressed with by this film, both at the time I first saw it many years ago, and recently again on this CRITERION DVD was the way Kurosawa used his camera. The way the woodcutter is walking through the forest, and especially the way the wind seems to capture the forest breathes life into the film. The forest appears to come alive as Takashi Shimura is walking through the woods. Plus, the way the wind blows and the sound of the rain falling at the beginning and ending of the film makes one feel they are part of the forest itself. This film will be talked about as long as cinema exists, and many will give their own interpretations of the film.For me, however, the film is telling in many ways, as each of the characters have something to hide: be it their own perception of the truth, or their unwillingness to come to terms with the truth: Be it guilt or shame. Moreover, I really like the way that Kurosawa uses the non-verbal area of the film: The visuals themselves. As in many Kurosawa films, the cinematography does much of the talking---and just looking at the scenery, and trying not to focus too much on the dialogue; one can see that Kurosawa relies heavily on the visuals themselves, as they are as much, if not more, of the story. As for who is telling the truth? And why are there different versions? This I leave for others to decide for themselves.

The truth exists only for an instant, after that it is only a memory, a memory filtered through human perception.  Does this make man evil?  No, it only makes him human...""Rashomon"" deals with such themes.  Akira Kurasawa's thought-provoking, meditative, and inovative film asks philosophical questions about the nature of truth, by showing one act of fatal violence as seen through the eyes of four different people.  The results are varied, and obscure the truth.  But this is far more complex than one would imagine, for the characters do not, as it is often said, tell the story to make themselves seem the more innocent.  In fact, 3/4 claim to have commited the murder themselves.  This results in a profound, but delightful psychological and philosophical puzzle of a film.The visual aesthetics of Kurasawa's film are beautiful, and most innovative considering the very low budget.  As a whole the film has a soft, meditative, and very Japanese feel.  Scenes of the sun playing through the trees, dappling the ground in dancing shadows, come to mind as being most effective.  But what is most impressive, is that the pacing can be so lively, and entertaining, despite the fact that the majority of the film is made up of variations of the same scene.Kurasawa's pallete of truth and humanity introduced western culture to Japanese cinema, and is still a fine introduction to the film of that culture.

354585,AC4Z26E60FBEM,6303073107,Fr. Charles Erlandson,"[3, 4]","Rashomon is one of the relatively few movies that truly deserves the name ""classic."" There are so many reasons why Rashomon is worth watching and so much has already been said about the movie, but here's my take. I watched it recently with my wife and my 16 and 15 year old kids, and I could tell that although it wasn't one my kids would have chosen, they understood that they were in the presence of something greater than the typical movie they've seen.So why should you watch Rashomon?1. It's a groundbreaking film. Many of Kurosawa's techniques were cutting edge at the time Rashomon was filmed. While this is one of the main reasons film critics give for rating movies highly, in my opinion it's not enough of a reason to call a movie great.2. Great acting. Many moviegoers wouldn't recognize this as great acting because the culture and moviemaking are so different from what they're used to. The greatness of the acting is best seen in how each actor or actress has to adapt to fit the 4 versions of the same story. But even great acting isn't enough to make a great film for me.3. Multiple perspectives and richness of meaning. We live in an age when we've come to expect that every story has multiple angles and no one right answer. I'd like to officially blame Rashomon for that. While the use of multiple perspectives has now become a common part of the grammar of cinema, with Rashomon it was revolutionary. The 4 different versions of the story not only create a deep layering effect on the question of what really happened but also create a sort of 3-D effect in terms of gaining some understanding of human nature. While Kurosawa's actors wanted to know which was the ""real"" story, the big K told them that no single one was correct. Even though, personally, this irks me just a little, the truth is that the movie reveals a lot about human nature.4. The movie reveals a lot about human nature. Now here's perhaps the best reason for calling a movie great. This is also why great movies like Rashomon transcend time and culture. I'm a 21st century Christian in America watching a Japanese movie from 1950 set in an unspecified time. And while the multiple perspectives preclude knowing exactly what happened, Kurosawa still manages to communicate truth. I can't reduce the message of the movie to a moral, but suffice it to say that Rashomon leaves you with a strong sense of the evil of humanity but also with the possibility of redemption.5. Great storytelling. What I noticed first about watching Rashomon with my kids was that the story sucked them in, and it did it without the following: rapid scene changes, a blaring soundtrack, lots of sound effects, rapid action, color film, noise that fills every crevice of the film's aural canvass, and a director who tells you exactly what to think and what he tells you to think is the same shallow, safe moralism - or anti-moralism and anti-heroism - that most movies offer. No, at the center of this story was a question: ""What happened?"" But the way the story was told and developed engrossed all of us.I wish some grand experiment could be conducted on teenagers (and adults!) today and have millions of them all sit down and watch Rashomon. I'd like to see if perhaps, in spite of the usual pablum they serve themselves, they wouldn't catch a glimpse of a deeper world that is worth thinking about and worth thinking about long after the trance induced by the movie had worn off.",5,Groundbreaking Classic That Still Transcends Time and Culture,1309737600,"07 4, 2011",2011,3449,"['Rashomon', 'one', 'relatively', 'few', 'movies', 'truly', 'name', 'classic', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'reasons', 'why', 'Rashomon', 'worth', 'watching', 'so', 'much', 'already', 'been', 'said', 'movie', 'here', 'take', 'watched', 'recently', 'wife', '16', '15', 'year', 'old', 'kids', 'could', 'tell', 'was', ""n't"", 'one', 'kids', 'would', 'have', 'chosen', 'understood', 'were', 'presence', 'something', 'greater', 'typical', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen.So', 'why', 'should', 'watch', 'Rashomon', '1', 'groundbreaking', 'film', 'Many', 'Kurosawa', 'techniques', 'were', 'cutting', 'edge', 'time', 'Rashomon', 'was', 'filmed', 'one', 'main', 'reasons', 'film', 'critics', 'give', 'rating', 'movies', 'highly', 'opinion', 'not', 'enough', 'reason', 'call', 'movie', 'great.2', 'Great', 'acting', 'Many', 'moviegoers', 'would', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'great', 'acting', 'culture', 'moviemaking', 'are', 'so', 'different', 'what', ""'re"", 'used', 'greatness', 'acting', 'best', 'seen', 'how', 'actor', 'actress', 'adapt', 'fit', '4', 'versions', 'same', 'story', 'even', 'great', 'acting', ""n't"", 'enough', 'make', 'great', 'film', 'me.3', 'Multiple', 'perspectives', 'richness', 'meaning', 'live', 'age', 'when', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'story', 'multiple', 'angles', 'one', 'right', 'answer', ""'d"", 'like', 'officially', 'blame', 'Rashomon', 'use', 'multiple', 'perspectives', 'now', 'become', 'common', 'part', 'grammar', 'cinema', 'Rashomon', 'was', 'revolutionary', '4', 'different', 'versions', 'story', 'not', 'only', 'create', 'deep', 'layering', 'effect', 'question', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'also', 'create', 'sort', '3-D', 'effect', 'terms', 'gaining', 'understanding', 'human', 'nature', 'Kurosawa', 'actors', 'wanted', 'know', 'was', 'real', 'story', 'big', 'K', 'told', 'single', 'one', 'was', 'correct', 'Even', 'personally', 'just', 'little', 'truth', 'movie', 'lot', 'human', 'nature.4', 'movie', 'lot', 'human', 'nature', 'Now', 'here', 'perhaps', 'best', 'reason', 'calling', 'movie', 'great', 'also', 'why', 'great', 'movies', 'Rashomon', 'transcend', 'time', 'culture', ""'m"", '21st', 'century', 'Christian', 'America', 'watching', 'Japanese', 'movie', '1950', 'set', 'unspecified', 'time', 'multiple', 'perspectives', 'preclude', 'knowing', 'exactly', 'what', 'happened', 'Kurosawa', 'still', 'communicate', 'truth', 'ca', ""n't"", 'reduce', 'message', 'movie', 'moral', 'say', 'Rashomon', 'strong', 'sense', 'evil', 'humanity', 'also', 'possibility', 'redemption.5', 'Great', 'storytelling', 'What', 'noticed', 'first', 'watching', 'Rashomon', 'kids', 'was', 'story', 'sucked', 'did', 'following', 'rapid', 'scene', 'changes', 'blaring', 'soundtrack', 'lots', 'sound', 'effects', 'rapid', 'action', 'color', 'film', 'noise', 'crevice', 'film', 'aural', 'canvass', 'director', 'who', 'exactly', 'what', 'think', 'what', 'think', 'same', 'shallow', 'safe', 'moralism', 'anti-moralism', 'anti-heroism', 'most', 'movies', 'offer', 'No', 'center', 'story', 'was', 'question', 'What', 'happened', 'way', 'story', 'was', 'told', 'developed', 'engrossed', 'us.I', 'wish', 'grand', 'experiment', 'could', 'be', 'conducted', 'teenagers', 'adults', 'today', 'have', 'millions', 'sit', 'down', 'watch', 'Rashomon', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'perhaps', 'spite', 'usual', 'pablum', 'serve', 'would', ""n't"", 'catch', 'glimpse', 'deeper', 'world', 'worth', 'thinking', 'worth', 'thinking', 'long', 'trance', 'induced', 'movie', 'had', 'worn', 'off']",Rashomon VHS

Many already know how my personal favourite Kurosawa filmSeven Samurai (The Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray] directly or indirectly influenced films likeThe Magnificent Seven [Blu-ray] and evenOcean's Trilogy (Ocean's Eleven / Ocean's Twelve / Ocean's Thirteen) [Blu-ray] but Rashomon has influenced too many future films and even tv dramas over the years to even be mentioned.  Every time you see a scene with a direct shot of the sun in it it's because of this film.  It was the first film shot mostly in the depths of the jungle too.  Every time Gregory House states in one of my all time favourite tv series ""House"" that ""everybody lies"" or every time we get to see alternate possibilities on any CSI episode all this has its genesis here in this brilliant Kurosawa classic.  Kurosawa himself once described this film as an attempt to show that everybody relates events that they have experienced in ways that put them in a favourable light or that no testimony is ever completely objective.  We see this premise here as every witness somehow manages to relate the same event in a way that they feel achieves a positive outcome for them.  Whose story is true?  The viewer will have to decide and for this viewer the answer is a mixture of all the stories but we'll never be sure and unlikeBlade Runner (30th Anniversary Collector's Edition) [Blu-ray] where Ridley Scott basically tells you if Decker is a replicant or not (at least in the special features documentary of the version that I have) Kurosawa does no such thing here and he leaves you to decide.Thankfully we get Criterion in the driver's seat and not Kino or worse StudioCanal and taking responsibility for the very important task of restoring and making this essential film worthy of a blu-ray release.  The source master isn't perfect but Criterion's effort at picture quality restoration does bear fruit and although it is not perfect you would have to try very hard to detect any obvious imperfections like spots or scratches although they are not completely eliminated.  Also the constrast and picture definition isn't the best that you'll see in other black and white 1080p releases but considering the age of the film they are still quite admirable.  The sound quality in Mono also isn't perfect but it is still very good.  Also included is a 48-page booklet containing essays on the film as well as the transfer details.Like any true classic film Rashomon rewards repeated viewing and while I enjoyed ""Seven Samurai"" a lot more this film is still one that I look forward to watching again and again on my short list of films to view at least once every year.This Criterion blu-ray release comes highly recommended and only just misses getting 5 stars from me because the picture and sound quality isn't the best but perhaps there will be another restoration attempt made in the future to outdo this one.  In the meantime this release will do very well and is probably the best version of the film that is currently out there.",4,An All-Time Great Film Now On Blu-Ray To Mostly Satisfying Results!,1357430400,"01 6, 2013",2013,3316,"['have', 'taken', 'so', 'much', 'what', 'film', 'introduced', '1950', 'granted', 'doubt', 'great', 'debt', 'film-makers', 'owe', 'wonderful', 'director', 'regards', 'massive', 'contributions', 'film-making', 'entire', 'lifetime', 'then', 'film', 'certainly', 'long', 'way', 'putting', 'rest', 'Many', 'already', 'know', 'how', 'personal', 'favourite', 'Kurosawa', 'filmSeven', 'Samurai', 'Criterion', 'Collection', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'directly', 'indirectly', 'influenced', 'films', 'likeThe', 'Magnificent', 'Seven', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'evenOcean', 'Trilogy', 'Ocean', 'Eleven', '/', 'Ocean', 'Twelve', '/', 'Ocean', 'Thirteen', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'Rashomon', 'influenced', 'too', 'many', 'future', 'films', 'even', 'tv', 'dramas', 'years', 'even', 'be', 'mentioned', 'time', 'see', 'scene', 'direct', 'shot', 'sun', 'film', 'was', 'first', 'film', 'shot', 'mostly', 'depths', 'jungle', 'too', 'Every', 'time', 'Gregory', 'House', 'one', 'time', 'favourite', 'tv', 'series', 'House', 'everybody', 'time', 'get', 'see', 'alternate', 'possibilities', 'CSI', 'episode', 'genesis', 'here', 'brilliant', 'Kurosawa', 'classic', 'Kurosawa', 'once', 'described', 'film', 'attempt', 'show', 'everybody', 'events', 'have', 'experienced', 'ways', 'put', 'favourable', 'light', 'testimony', 'ever', 'completely', 'objective', 'see', 'premise', 'here', 'witness', 'somehow', 'relate', 'same', 'event', 'way', 'feel', 'positive', 'outcome', 'Whose', 'story', 'true', 'viewer', 'will', 'have', 'decide', 'viewer', 'answer', 'mixture', 'stories', ""'ll"", 'never', 'be', 'sure', 'unlikeBlade', 'Runner', '30th', 'Anniversary', 'Collector', 'Edition', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'where', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'basically', 'Decker', 'replicant', 'not', 'least', 'special', 'features', 'documentary', 'version', 'have', 'Kurosawa', 'such', 'thing', 'here', 'decide.Thankfully', 'get', 'Criterion', 'driver', 'seat', 'not', 'Kino', 'worse', 'StudioCanal', 'taking', 'responsibility', 'very', 'important', 'task', 'restoring', 'making', 'essential', 'film', 'worthy', 'blu-ray', 'release', 'source', 'master', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'Criterion', 'effort', 'picture', 'quality', 'restoration', 'bear', 'fruit', 'not', 'perfect', 'would', 'have', 'try', 'very', 'hard', 'detect', 'obvious', 'imperfections', 'spots', 'scratches', 'are', 'not', 'completely', 'eliminated', 'Also', 'constrast', 'picture', 'definition', ""n't"", 'best', ""'ll"", 'see', 'other', 'black', 'white', '1080p', 'releases', 'considering', 'age', 'film', 'are', 'still', 'quite', 'admirable', 'sound', 'quality', 'Mono', 'also', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'Also', 'included', '48-page', 'booklet', 'containing', 'essays', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'transfer', 'true', 'classic', 'film', 'Rashomon', 'rewards', 'repeated', 'viewing', 'enjoyed', 'Seven', 'Samurai', 'lot', 'more', 'film', 'still', 'one', 'look', 'forward', 'watching', 'again', 'again', 'short', 'list', 'films', 'view', 'least', 'once', 'year.This', 'Criterion', 'blu-ray', 'release', 'highly', 'recommended', 'only', 'just', 'getting', '5', 'stars', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', ""n't"", 'best', 'perhaps', 'will', 'be', 'restoration', 'attempt', 'made', 'future', 'outdo', 'one', 'meantime', 'release', 'will', 'do', 'very', 'well', 'probably', 'best', 'version', 'film', 'currently', 'there']",Rashomon VHS

354588,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,6303073107,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[61, 63]","Somewhat curiously, Japanese critics were not enthusiastic about RASHOMON when it was released in 1950 Japan.  Today, however, RASHOMON is generally considered to be the film that introduced both master director Akira Kurosawa and Japanese cinema to the west; it is also often cited as the film that prompted The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to create an award for Best Foreign Language film.  It is widely regarded as a masterwork of world cinema.Set in 12th Century Japan, the film's premise is at once both very simple and very complex.  A man is found dead in a forrest, and several people are brought forward to give testimony in the matter.  In some respects their accounts agree--but in numerous others, some obvious and some very subtle, their stories differ.  As each character gives his or her version of events, the various differences pile higher and higher, leaving the viewer to wonder at the motivations involved.Has each person simply interpreted the same facts in different ways?  Do they deliberately lie in order to protect themselves?  Are the differences in their stories deliberate or subconcious?  The film offers no easy answers.  Some have criticized the film for seeming to state that there is no such thing as ultimate truth, but RASHOMON is more complex than this: it is essentially a meditation on our inability, be it deliberate or unintentional, to reach more than an approximation of ultimate truth due to the very nature of humanity itself.Much has been written about the look of the film, which is indeed memorable.  Filmed by Kazuo Miyagawa, it presents the forrest as a living, breathing entity; the images are powerful, the editing remarkable.  No less so are the performances, which require the various actors to shift in behavior as each person involved gives their own account of the event; this is particularly true of Toshiro Mifune, a frequent performer in Kurosawa films, and actress Machiko Ky&#333;.  But whether lead or supporting player, all performaces are equally astonishing.The film has been extremely, extremely influential over the years, and as such it no longer has quite the same ""shock of the new"" that it had for audiences of the 1950s; nonetheless, this is director Kurosawa working very close to the height of his power, and while he would create other films that equalled and bested RASHOMON, it remains among his masterworks.  The Criterion edition is quite fine, offering a near-pristine print with your choice of subtitles or dubbing (the former is recommended) and several memorable extras.

Script is tight and the plot is simple but when we hear four different versions of a same incident from four different persons in the film, it is perplexing and even confusing. I watched this after a long time, still it was as fresh as when I watched it for the first time.The film on surface revolves around rather a simple incident of rape of wife of a samurai by a bandit and subsequent killing (or suicide?) of the samurai by the bandit. However beneath the visuals, it deals with something more fundamental and abstract - that is of our perception of truth. When we describe or tell something, we may deliberately tell a false. That is simple. But we may tell something, that we BELIEVE to be true, but we MAY BE wrong in our perception in the beginning. This is a second type of lie (or truth?). When the film ends after delivering one of the finest example of imagery even by today's standard, we are also puzzled - like the woodcutter and the priest - within this conflict of apparent and real truth.

You'll read many reviews and commentaries on how the film is about ""the subjectivity of truth"", but this couldn't be further from the truth! The film is about the human tendency to DENY the truth, which is both real and essential to the growth of the individual.Kurosawa himself said of the film's message: ""Human beings are unable to be honest with themselves about themselves. They cannot talk about themselves without embellishing. This script portrays such human beings--the kind who cannot survive without lies to make them feel they are better people than they really are.""The film makes no statement about the reality of truth, or even its attainability, but instead about our unwillingness to take an objective look at ourselves. The films characters embody the variety of responses and choices we take in life: selfish cynicism to moral despair, to true responsibility in the face of an unpleasant view of our true natures. The characters are similar in that they lie to themselves, to ""save face"", and to see themselves as better than they actually are. And yet they differ in their willingness to suffer the pain of a view of themselves.It is in this willingness that the road to truth exists, and self-knowledge is the key in Kurosawa's vision. The final scene is hauntingly beautiful in its symbolism: the man who has taken the first step to self-knowledge bears the child - his own soul - into the world.An absolute classic and highly recommended!",5,The Lies We Tell Ourselves,1263168000,"01 11, 2010",2010,1565,"['Rashomon', 'one', 'Kurosawa', 'masterpieces', 'deceptively', 'clever', 'moving', 'portrayal', 'human', 'nature', ""'ll"", 'read', 'many', 'reviews', 'commentaries', 'how', 'film', 'subjectivity', 'truth', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'further', 'truth', 'film', 'human', 'tendency', 'DENY', 'truth', 'real', 'essential', 'growth', 'individual.Kurosawa', 'said', 'film', 'message', 'Human', 'beings', 'are', 'unable', 'be', 'honest', 'can', 'not', 'talk', 'embellishing', 'script', 'such', 'human', 'beings', 'kind', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'survive', 'lies', 'make', 'feel', 'are', 'better', 'people', 'really', 'are', 'film', 'statement', 'reality', 'truth', 'even', 'attainability', 'instead', 'unwillingness', 'take', 'objective', 'look', 'ourselves', 'films', 'characters', 'embody', 'variety', 'responses', 'choices', 'take', 'life', 'selfish', 'cynicism', 'moral', 'despair', 'true', 'responsibility', 'face', 'unpleasant', 'view', 'true', 'natures', 'characters', 'are', 'similar', 'lie', 'save', 'face', 'see', 'better', 'actually', 'are', 'yet', 'differ', 'willingness', 'suffer', 'pain', 'view', 'themselves.It', 'willingness', 'road', 'truth', 'exists', 'self-knowledge', 'key', 'Kurosawa', 'vision', 'final', 'scene', 'hauntingly', 'beautiful', 'symbolism', 'man', 'who', 'taken', 'first', 'step', 'self-knowledge', 'bears', 'child', 'own', 'soul', 'world.An', 'absolute', 'classic', 'highly', 'recommended']",Rashomon VHS
354592,A26HFSVLAGULIM,6303073107,"Heather L. Parisi ""Robert and Heather Parisi""","[3, 4]","RAMBLING ABOUT RASHOMON:This film is not an easy thing to watch. In English it is somewhat less effective and in Japanese one must contend with the subtitles. Still, I suggest the Japanese with subtitles. Be aware, however, that this is a highly visual film so avoid getting bogged down in the subtitles. More than any other film I have seen, ""Rashomon"" shows rather than tells, so be prepared to pay very close attention to seemingly small details. Like Kubrick, everything you see and the way you see it has been reduced or altered to be just what is needed for the story. In essence, this is a rather stark though epic production and it may take a few viewings to truly appreciate ""Rashomon's"" true splendor and significance. It is a short movie that I wished was longer though I was quite satisfied with the ending.WHAT THIS FILM IS ABOUT: [Without giving away the plot of course.]HOPE! Through the re-enactment of some perceptional permutations and nuances of a tragic event we are almost left with the conclusion that human beings are fatally-flawed, evil, weak beings fueled by lust and driven with selfish motives and little else.THE MESSAGE OF HOPE:But then there is a ray of hope in the form of a helpless abandoned infant and what follows. What we see is intrinsically-flawed humans that through self-awareness may seek to improve their character. If this is true, maybe then through self-awareness, human flaws may be intrinsic but solvable over time making us flawed but NOT FATALLY FLAWED! Sentience may over time be our deliverance in the form of character and integrity. If this is true, then humans are not naturally depraved and everything may not be preordained. Perhaps we are a kind of ""work-in-progress"". What a nice thought, though Kurosawa gives it to us rather like castor oil.ABOUT THE DVD:This is a Criterion Collection DVD and that speaks for itself. Here, however, the best special feature is the rather large booklet that is included with the DVD.

354593,A16CZRQL23NOIW,6303073107,Hiram Gomez Pardo,"[2, 3]","Rashomon is a masterpiece. This film shows us a hard statement that maybe disagree to many people; the truth doesn't exist. We see always fragments of it no matter how old you are.Aesop in his fables states: in every man always there are three ; that who he thinks he is; what other people think he is and finally that one who really is. In that sense Goethe talked about four levels of the reality; lineal, literal, methaporical and finally the cosmic.In what level are you when you assume the judgement about a fact?Remember his beliefs are always relative; your ethical world depends about a lot of issues; such as your social status; your religion; your birthplace; your culture and even your age; so be careful when you say are in possesion of the absolute true.And that's what the movie shows us; a terrible murder; five persons state about the fact ; and before you five different versions are given. So, the questions is; who of these persons is lying and who is true?All of us have a sight blind; and because of this you may agree with some of these people; and your close friend or even your couple may be perfectly disagree with you.The reasonable doubt is a very well konwn device employed by all the lawyers in their cases . Indeed, this term inspired to Sidney Lumet for making his opera prima &quot;Twelve angry men&quot; in 1957.Back to Rashomon we find to Akira Kurosawa in one of his major achievements. The handle camera is superb; and this is the first film in the story where , by the first time the camera shows us the sun; a brilliant methapor and also a challenging aaproach by this master director.Mesmerizing ; unforgettable ; you'll be shocked every time you watch. Remember what the woman says uin a sequence: &quot;The men lie because they are weak&quot;.And this point is remarkable, just because the fragile human condition; the human being always will keep his dignity, pride and a set of values above all the odds; and through this process, the truth is always put in a second place, by obvious reasons.Heissenberg established the uncertain principle in 1930 and this review is far to explain about this issue, but what it deserves to call your attention at the time you say ; I found the truth; or even worst; I represent the truth.This procedure is typical of dictatorial regimes; the state is me and other similar statements reveal a syntom of being out of the life and even the nature, a wise mind always thinks and acts; after rethinks and reacts; but never remains quiet.Kurosawa adapted this film from a novel from the same title  Rashomon from 1927 written by Yabu no Naka.This film is a wonderful exploraton of truth and human weakness.In fact this film is watched and analyzed in Post Grade School of Management, for purposes related with another goals.This film was remade in 1964 as Outrage for Martin Ritt, where Paul Newman plays the role of Toshiro Mifune in the original version.A true landmark.

354595,A366S12KCZ280V,6303073107,"Janet Chandler ""Music/Movie Lover""","[1, 2]","I have been a fan of the Japanese director Akira Kurosawa for many years. His list of films he directed are all well known and admired by movie fans all over the world. Many are considered masterpieces including films like ""Seven Samurai"", ""Ikiru"" and ""Ran"" among them. The 1950 film ""Rashomon"" is another one considered a masterpiece by many. It was probably the first major movie to be made by Kurosawa after the end of World War II.I consider it an almost masterpiece. That is I like this film but don't feel it is ranks up there among he other masterpieces. Before seeing it for the first time I had read a lot about ""Rashomon"". Most of it with glowing reviews. So when I saw it for the first time while I did enjoy watching it and was caught up it in the story I was at the same time slightly disappointed in it. It seemed to me to lack a little bit in being called a masterpiece. I found I wasn't quite as caught up in the story or in the characters the way I was in watching other Kurosawa movies. In fact after the first time I watched it I felt even a little let down by the experience. After a couple of more viewings of ""Rashomon"" my opinion began to be more favorable towards it. Still for me ""Rashomon"" is just a near masterpiece.That is not to say the story to the film is not interesting because it is and very unique. The story itself takes place in 12th century Japan. A murder and rape has taken place but what exactly happened? We don't see the actual events as they occur. Instead after the body has been found and reported to the police the viewer is then presented with four different versions of what happened. We first hear from the road bandit, who is accused of both the rape and murder that took place, as to what happened. Then we hear from the wife of the murdered man who tells what she saw and how she was raped. Then in an interesting twist in the story we hear from a medium who the murdered man is speaking through who tells what occurred. Finally we hear from the woodcutter who found the body originally and who in fact may have seen just what had happened. The whole premise to the movie is just what is truth and who is telling it in ""Rashomon"". One version must be the right version of what just did happened. If so does that mean everyone else is lying as to what happened? Or is it that between all or some of the versions does the truth appear in bits and pieces leaving the viewer to take the parts from each version to form one whole truth? Or if you really want to get philosophical does everyone have their own idea just what truth is or is it human nature for people to lie? In that regard the film does prove interesting and compelling for the viewer to watch so they can put together just what they think the truth, as well as truth itself, really is. This is a movie that can get you thinking. At the same time there is some action to it as the road bandit and the murdered man, a samurai, get into a sword fight. There even is a touch of comedy in it. One of the versions of the sword fight scene becomes a little bit humorous in its portrayal as both men act like they want to kill each other while at the same time trying to run away.Two things that do make this movie worth the viewing is the acting and the cinematography. The cast of ""Rashomon"" is first rate with some of the best Japanese actors to appear in it. It is lead by Kurosawa's favorite actor over the years Toshiro Mifune who is the road bandit. I would rate this as one of Mifune's finest performances in his career. The cinematography is groundbreaking which helps to bring life to the movie with camera angles and unique shots which would become influential in other future movies by other directors.This is a movie everyone should watch at least once. Maybe if you do you will consider ""Rashomon"" a masterpiece as many others do. I will admit while I was a bit disappointed in it the first time I watched ""Rashomon"" it has grown on me little by little in subsequent viewings.

What is truth?--surely a hard theme to tackle. Seems to me that whether the samurai was killed with a dagger or a sword could be easily determined--at least today. There would be fingerprints, etc. On the other hand, consider how much of the story depends on interpretation. Does the samurai really look at his wife with disgust after she is raped? After all, only she would really know--he doesn't say anything. Is she really fierce, as the bandit says, or weeping and weak as she appears in court? Was Kurosawa really poking fun at the genre with the clumsy fighting, or was he depicting stark reality for an audience that still romanticized ancient times? And is the ending really redemptive--I found myself wondering if the woodcutter would go off and sell the child if it was a girl. Even though Kurosawa intended it to be uplifting--note the shining sun--couldn't we wonder otherwise?I found this film extremely interesting as a precursor to the notion that truth is ambiguous--but not non-existent.Did anyone notice that during Machiko Kyo's (the wife) testomony, the score sounded suspiciously like Bolero--but not quite.

Has some good extras including an in depth analysis commentary that provides deep insight about the story, script writing, cinematography and directing within the context of traditional Japanese culture. Options include Japanese or dubbed English dialog (both mono), and English subtitles. It's interesting to watch with dubbed English and subtitles as they are clearly different translations. Found using both together that it provides additional insight into the more subtle meaning of the Japanese dialog.Roshamon is not an original screenplay, it is an adpttion of two Akutagawa short stories, &#34;Roshmon&#34; providing the story-telling setting and infant scene, and &#34;In a Grove&#34; providing the plot and charcters. Even without the optional analysis commentary, it becomes clear within the first 20 minutes or so this is not a Kurosawa action film. It is intellectual and challenges the viewer's concepts about absolute Truth and reality. It is a mental exercise as the priest and the woodsman relate their story about a crime and trial they recently saw to a third party who is curious, wanting to be entertained while waiting out a torrential rainstorm in the shelter of the Rashomon Gate.  The priest in particular is losing his faith and belief in the basic Goodness of humanity after hearing the very different and self-serving testimony at the trial. The basic facts that a rape and murder occurred are not disputed, but who committed the murder and how both were carried out are what substantially differ in five different versions of the events (woodsman with original and later revised stories, notorious bandit on trial, murdered samurai via a &#34;medium, and samurai's wife who was raped by the bandit). It's an absolutely outstanding exploration of Truth, what it is, and how it relates to what people perceive, remember and want or wish to believe. Add to it strong probability of ulterior motives and self-interest tainting the testimony. The themes are universal and timeless, and Kurasowa's portrayal of the story allows the film to be readily understood in nearly any country/culture, 60+ years later. It is cited by some as Japan's &#34;Citizen Kane,&#34; their all-time greatest film with groundbreaking flashback-driven screenplay, directing, acting and cinematography (albeit a much different plot). Not surprising to me that Roshamon received the 1952 Academy Award (Oscar) for Best Foreign Language Film, and has withstood the test of time, continuing to place high on lists of the best Japanese films.Like two other Kurosawa films that were remade as Westerns, &#34;The Outrage&#34; in 1964 with Paul Newman, Edward G. Robinson and a very young Willim Shatner very closely follows Roshamon (with Kurosawa credited for the screenplay. The other two are Seven Samurai / Magnificent Seven and Yojimbo / Fistful of Dollars. Other films use major elements or the same themes more abstractly, but analysis shows the source.This is a film well worth seeing, more than once as the finer details in the story and Kurosawa's directing become more apparent",5,Excellent Film and Blu-ray Transfer by Criterion,1368230400,"05 11, 2013",2013,3226,"['Blu-ray', 'typical', 'Criterion', 'excellence', 'keeping', 'mind', 'starting', 'point', '1950', 'Japanese', 'B', 'W', 'mediocre', 'fidelity', 'monaural', 'audio', 'good', 'extras', 'including', 'depth', 'analysis', 'commentary', 'deep', 'insight', 'story', 'script', 'writing', 'cinematography', 'directing', 'context', 'traditional', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'Options', 'include', 'Japanese', 'dubbed', 'English', 'dialog', 'mono', 'English', 'subtitles', 'interesting', 'watch', 'dubbed', 'English', 'subtitles', 'are', 'clearly', 'different', 'translations', 'Found', 'using', 'together', 'additional', 'insight', 'more', 'subtle', 'meaning', 'Japanese', 'dialog.Roshamon', 'not', 'original', 'screenplay', 'adpttion', 'two', 'Akutagawa', 'short', 'stories', '34', 'Roshmon', '34', 'providing', 'story-telling', 'setting', 'infant', 'scene', '34', 'Grove', '34', 'providing', 'plot', 'charcters', 'Even', 'optional', 'analysis', 'commentary', 'clear', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'so', 'not', 'Kurosawa', 'action', 'film', 'intellectual', 'viewer', 'concepts', 'absolute', 'Truth', 'reality', 'mental', 'exercise', 'priest', 'woodsman', 'relate', 'story', 'crime', 'trial', 'recently', 'saw', 'third', 'party', 'who', 'curious', 'wanting', 'be', 'entertained', 'waiting', 'out', 'torrential', 'rainstorm', 'shelter', 'Rashomon', 'Gate', 'priest', 'particular', 'losing', 'faith', 'belief', 'basic', 'Goodness', 'humanity', 'hearing', 'very', 'different', 'self-serving', 'testimony', 'trial', 'basic', 'facts', 'rape', 'murder', 'occurred', 'are', 'not', 'disputed', 'who', 'committed', 'murder', 'how', 'were', 'carried', 'out', 'are', 'what', 'substantially', 'differ', 'five', 'different', 'versions', 'events', 'woodsman', 'original', 'later', 'revised', 'stories', 'notorious', 'bandit', 'trial', 'murdered', 'samurai', '34', 'medium', 'samurai', 'wife', 'who', 'was', 'raped', 'bandit', 'absolutely', 'outstanding', 'exploration', 'Truth', 'what', 'how', 'what', 'people', 'perceive', 'remember', 'want', 'wish', 'believe', 'Add', 'strong', 'probability', 'ulterior', 'motives', 'self-interest', 'tainting', 'testimony', 'themes', 'are', 'universal', 'timeless', 'Kurasowa', 'portrayal', 'story', 'film', 'be', 'readily', 'understood', 'nearly', 'country/culture', '60+', 'years', 'later', 'cited', 'Japan', '34', 'Citizen', 'Kane', '34', 'all-time', 'greatest', 'film', 'groundbreaking', 'flashback-driven', 'screenplay', 'directing', 'acting', 'cinematography', 'much', 'different', 'plot', 'Not', 'surprising', 'Roshamon', 'received', '1952', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Language', 'Film', 'withstood', 'test', 'time', 'continuing', 'place', 'high', 'lists', 'best', 'Japanese', 'films.Like', 'two', 'other', 'Kurosawa', 'films', 'were', 'remade', 'Westerns', '34', 'Outrage', '34', '1964', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'Edward', 'G.', 'Robinson', 'very', 'young', 'Willim', 'Shatner', 'very', 'closely', 'Roshamon', 'Kurosawa', 'credited', 'screenplay', 'other', 'two', 'are', 'Seven', 'Samurai', '/', 'Magnificent', 'Seven', 'Yojimbo', '/', 'Fistful', 'Dollars', 'Other', 'films', 'use', 'major', 'elements', 'same', 'themes', 'more', 'abstractly', 'analysis', 'source.This', 'film', 'well', 'seeing', 'more', 'once', 'finer', 'details', 'story', 'Kurosawa', 'directing', 'become', 'more', 'apparent']",Rashomon VHS

In that age of conformity it confirmed some of their worst fears:  That they were being turned into vegetables & parents & elders shouldn't be believed.  Truth was used simply as a tool of the powerful.  Truth was an exercise of power; hence:  Mutable.  A few years later LA DOLCE VITA confirmed another suspicion that the behaviour of one's betters, when behind locked doors & away from the sight of their children, was atrocious.  In this magnificent Kurosawa film set in 9th century Japan a nobleman & his wife traveling through a forest are set upon by a highwayman.  The nobleman is killed, his wife raped & the whole thing is witnessed by a woodsman.  The highwayman is later arrested & at his trial these incidents are examined & re-examined by having each of the 4 participants tell their version.  The dead man speaks through the mouth of a medium.  Each narrator relates the same incidents but in each telling the narrator becomes the protagonist & the nuances are different.  How can one know the truth of anything?  And with each telling the puzzle deepens & becomes more & more fascinating.  A word of warning:  The wife's voice is chalk on slate & you may find yourself hitting the mute button.  Also the music is by a Ravel 'wannabe'.  It's BOLERO written by a supremely untalented plagiarist.  When the movie was first released here some exhibitors instructed projectionists to turn off the sound during long stretches without dialogue.  (Ravel was revered by the beats of the time.)

Akira Kurosawa, probably best known here in the states for The Seven Samarai, creates a puzzling movie that the mind can't help but ponder over long after the movie is finished.The simple plot is about three people.  A warrior, his wife and a bandit.  The wife is raped, the warrior is murdered and the bandit is captured.  The story is being narrated to us by two men, a woodsman and a priest, both who witnessed not only parts of the crime but also the testimony of the wife, the bandit and even the warrior (via a medium) in court.What this movie eventually becomes is an experiment on truth and reality. As all the testimonies contradict each other, we begin to doubt each person's reality.  The story is told 5 different times, none of them in agreement, and what we begin to realize is that Kurosawa is trying to show us how our reality is altered by our perceptions.The extras on the DVD are great, Criterion has succeeded again in putting together a great deal of extras that add to a movie that would easily stand on its own.  Robert Altman introduces the movie, and talks about why the movie is one of his favorites.  Also, a Kurasawa expert, Donald Richie, has recorded a commentary that helps the viewer really appreciate the subtle nuances of Rashomon, little points like how much silent film influenced Kurosawa.This movie is a classic and has influenced film makers in the states for years.

All the stories have a grain of truth but all the stories also contradict each other. As I was watching the movie, the peasant's story seemed to tie up the loose ends except that for the fact that a notorious bandit like Tajomaru does not get that way by being a snivelling coward. He had surely killed many people before and dispatching the noble man in cold blood would not be as difficult for him as the peasant seems to suggest.

354609,AYCJSA9HR7TKO,6303073107,Kerry Walters,"[1, 1]","Everytime I watch ""Rashomon,"" I'm reminded of the problem of the synoptic gospels.  How can three accounts of the same person differ so much in detail?  And do the differences between them render them false?It seems to me that Kurosawa invites viewers to reflect on memory, narrative, and accuracy in this gripping synoptic account of the murder of a husband and the rape of his wife.  That the two crimes took place is indisputable.  But the four witnesses to them--a woodcutter, the wife, the criminal, and the victim (through a medium) all famously give different accounts of them.  Kurosawa deliberately leaves the viewer in suspense as to the ""correct"" account.  Accuracy isn't what's important here so much as the four different narratives and the psychological reasons why the four witnesses experienced the same event so differently.  If there was ever a compelling argument against taking eye-witness reports literally, this is it.And yet truth emerges from the four accounts, as from the three synoptic gospels.  It's not literal truth, but is what might be called existential truth.  We learn something valuable about the way in which memory reconstructs events and about human passions, fears, hopes, and yearning.So much has been said about Kazuo Miyagawa's cinematography here and elsewhere that I've nothing to add.  It's really genius the way he manages to capture the dappled light of the forest, and his ability to switch back and forth between the faces of the witnesses without in any way blocking the story's flow is admirable.  The acting, while a bit overblown in places for western tastes (particularly Toshiro Mifune's portrayal of the criminal), isn't bad at all.The Criterion edition is, as usual, nicely transferred.

354612,A1U6B2LDK3BUVU,6303073107,"LF ""Keep your feedback to yourself, these are...","[20, 48]","This is a fairly good movie, ridiculously overrated.  It is the story of a bandit's assault on a couple in the woods.  Perhaps he rapes the woman.  Perhaps he kills the man.  Perhaps the woman prefers the rapist to her husband.  Perhaps not.The most annoying thing about the analysis of this movie is that people come to the conclusion that there is no such thing as absolute truth, that it all depends on who is telling the story.  Baloney.  There is such a thing as absolute truth.  It doesn't all depend on who is telling the story.  The opposing view is just a bunch of over-intellectualized garbage.  Either the bandit killed the man or he didn't. Either the woman asked him to kill her husband or she didn't.  Those who take an opposing view are just being silly and stupid.  They are over-intellectualizing.  Keep it simple, stupid.How about this.  I punch you in the head.  Then I say I didn't do it, it all depends on who is telling the story.  Make sense to you?  That's the argument being used by fools who draw idiotic conclusions after seeing this movie.It is the quantum theory of movies.  There is no truth.  It is one of the stupidest positions that Stephen Hawking ever took.  You can't just say that one thing happened.  Every possible thing happened.  Gimme a break.  Would a grain of common sense be inappropriate?It seems clear that the overly heroic version told by the bandit, about his daring swordfight, about the woman begging to be his wife after she was raped by him, is a bunch of bull, because he has a motive to tell things this way.  His motive is to paint himself as the kind of hero he admires.Nobody really tells a convincing story here.  One thing I like about the movie is that one of the witnesses is a trance medium who channels the dead man.  He should know what happened, and he should have no motive to lie.  What was his story anyway?  You hear so many stories, you forget who told what.  Did he say it was suicide?  If the movie had more emotional power, I'd care more what happened to the characters.  It is emotionless.  That is its biggest weakness.It is a bit of a comedy.  The acting is overdone.  The duels are overdone.  The director was consciously making fun of the genre, of the Japanese movies that stage stupid duels with the same stock things happening, the sword getting stuck, the men chasing each other around a tree, one guy falling, sort of like old cowboy movies that keep showing you similar fight scenes.  The woman getting blamed for her own rape.  So many cliches pulled out for us.  A lot of ""in"" jokes for the viewer, making fun of the same old same old in Japanese films.In the end, they pull a baby out of a hat.  The baby has absolutely nothing to do with the film.  Nothing.  It isn't the raped woman's baby.  It is so completely incongruous to the rest of the movie that I thought it must be the raped woman's baby somehow, but it isn't.  It's just a baby pulled out of a hat.On the commentary, the speaker makes a big deal about how the baby symbolizes hope, and how great Kurosawa is for thinking of using this baby to symbolize hope.  What a bunch of baloney that is.  It is over-intellectualized nonsense.  The diagonals that are shown on screen, the triangles that are shown on screen, all further the plot, all show the greatness of Kurosawa.  No they don't.  It is all over-intellectualized nonsense.  Diagonals and triangles do not make a great film.  They just give lecturers something to flimflam their audiences with.  I don't doubt that Kurosawa used these diagonals and triangles purposely.  I don't care either.  It's just a bunch of baloney.  I'm not emotionally moved by a triangle, nor even by a diagonal.  The subtlety of it is just a wee bit too subtle to make an impact on me.To sum up, this is a pretty interesting movie that is ridiculously overrated.  To be great, a movie should move us.  This one doesn't.  It's pretty good.  That's about it.

It means that the truth is elusive and people will remember things with their own particular spin.  When the film first came out it was nominated for an academy award and is still considered the masterpiece of the director Akira Kurosawa.Shot in black and white, the mood is set right at the beginning, as there's a rainstorm going on and a priest and a woodcutter are seeking shelter in an ancient temple.  Both of them are troubled, as they have heard witnesses to a crime explain events that they just ""don't understand"".  When a third man joins them, they tell their stories.  Eventually the audience watches the reenactment of four different versions of the same incident.  At the end, there is still confusion.The acting is done in classical Japanese style, which is more appropriate for a large auditorium than for a small screen.  The actors shout, they roll their eyes, and every gesture is exaggerated.  There's passion throughout and a great mythic theme.  It seemed all to be set on a great stage.  And the interesting part is that three out of the four people telling the story claim to be the killer.  The cinematography is also special, using the rain as one realm of reality and harsh sunlight as another.  The woods in which the crime takes place look hot and stifling, and the actors are all excellent.However, once the novelty of the setting and the dramatic elements of this stylized film wore off, I found myself restless.

Then I saw that NYC's Film Forum was showing ""Rashomon"" as part of a Kurasawa festival: I said to myself, TutorGal it's now or never! So I rounded up my friend Renee the psychotherapist and went.Wow! Yes, it's clear to see why this movie was such a revelation back in 1950-1 when it appeared on the scene. Compare it, for example, to 1950's Oscar winner, ""All About Eve"". At the outset of ""Eve"", we're introduced to a tableful of people at an award show, looking at the two-faced Eve accept her award. As we go round the table, we hear every character's thoughts about Eve, and then go back in time to that part of the story. The story, however, moves forward chronologically; we never revisit a scene, either, to see if somebody else perceived it differently.Well, that IS what the hoopla was about with ""Rashomon"". We start with three men meeting during a rainstorm in a deserted building. Two tell the third man about the murder trial where they've just given evidence. Then we go back in time to the trial, where we see the various witnesses and the defendant tell their versions of what happened. As they do, we return over and over to the scene of the crime, and each time the murder is enacted differently.  The idea of presenting multiple perspectives of the same incident was ground-breaking for 1950, and has been imitated over the years, but rarely as well as in the original, ""Rashomon"".I felt I had to brace myself for seeing this movie, because I read it was about a murder AND a rape, and I balked at seeing a rape scene (yet how many murders would you say you and I have both seen in movies, huh?). However, I was relieved to see that the rape is never shown; that part of the story is always over by the time we revisit the scene. In fact, the woman doesn't even appear to be disheveled. The IDEA of the rape is the important thing, not its enactment on screen. Some have commented on the amount of apparent overacting and screaming going on with both the woman character and Mifune's bandit, but it didn't bother me too much.All in all, this was my first excursion into classic Japanese cinema (unless you would count all those Godzilla and Gidra movies as classics of a sort), and it was not only interesting anthropologically, but entertaining as well.

The movie is a combination two stories one in which a buddhist monk, a woodcutter and eventually a farmer are sheltering in the Rashomon gate of Kyoto during a rainstorm.  The monk and the woodcutter begin telling a disturbing tale which the farmer listens to with interest.  They had witnesses a trial of a thief who was accused of murdering a lord who was traveling through the forest with his wife.  The story is told in three parts, the thief tells his story, the wife hers and a medium tells the husband/murder victims story.  Much of it involves the rape of the wife who has an interest because she is considered disgraced by the rape and a lack of status.  Was she willingly ""raped"" by the thief?  Did she end up humiliated by both men who saw her as worthless after the act?  Or did the husband see her encourage the thief to kill him so there would be no witness to her shame?

It feels 'different'.Rashomon is the story of a man's death told from four different points of view. A man takes his wife through a forest when they encounter a bandit, Tajomaru, played by Toshiro Mifune, Kurosawa's favourite actor. The events which take place between that moment and the death of the man are unknown.Four recollections are told from Tajomaru's point of view, the man's wife point of view, the man's spirit point of view, and, finally, from the peasant who is out collecting firewood and sees the incident. Every character tells his or her story to appear as if they've done nothing wrong. That's why it's difficult to believe any of them.The direction of the film is beautiful. Every scene is perfect, like a fairy tale (one memorable scene is when the woman spins around in the dust and is possessed by her dead husband's spirit). Mifune's character, Tajomaru, is a rogue, full of mischief and animalism, basically what Mifune does best.Rashomon's quality lies in its philosophies of mankind. We're already living in hell and there's no such thing as truth, laughs one of the peasants, though, if you're not put off by thoughtful films, Rashomon is quite heavenly to watch.",1,A delight,982281600,"02 16, 2001",2001,1332,"['Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'loved', 'rain', 'opening', 'shot', 'rain', 'used', 'mask', 'thought', 'doubt', 'Rashomon', 'very', 'strange', 'film', 'feels', 'story', 'man', 'death', 'told', 'four', 'different', 'points', 'view', 'man', 'wife', 'forest', 'when', 'encounter', 'bandit', 'Tajomaru', 'played', 'Toshiro', 'Mifune', 'Kurosawa', 'favourite', 'actor', 'events', 'take', 'place', 'moment', 'death', 'man', 'are', 'unknown.Four', 'recollections', 'are', 'told', 'Tajomaru', 'point', 'view', 'man', 'wife', 'point', 'view', 'man', 'spirit', 'point', 'view', 'finally', 'peasant', 'who', 'out', 'collecting', 'firewood', 'incident', 'character', 'story', 'appear', ""'ve"", 'done', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'why', 'difficult', 'believe', 'them.The', 'direction', 'film', 'beautiful', 'scene', 'perfect', 'fairy', 'tale', 'one', 'memorable', 'scene', 'when', 'woman', 'dust', 'possessed', 'dead', 'husband', 'spirit', 'Mifune', 'character', 'Tajomaru', 'rogue', 'full', 'mischief', 'animalism', 'basically', 'what', 'Mifune', 'best.Rashomon', 'quality', 'philosophies', 'mankind', ""'re"", 'already', 'living', 'hell', 'such', 'thing', 'truth', 'one', 'peasants', 'though', ""'re"", 'not', 'put', 'off', 'thoughtful', 'films', 'Rashomon', 'quite', 'heavenly', 'watch']",Rashomon VHS

As such, I found myself looking and thinking ahead rather than focussing on the current scene on the screen.This is an older movie which should be appreciated for what a masterful work it was in its' time.  It hasn't lost much during its' tenure but the texture of this black and white movie has seen better days.  The acting is very good and, to better appreciate it, I watched it in Japanese with sub-titles.  The DVD has other options for viewing including English dubbing.  I will probably look at that option the next time I view it.The story is simple yet complex.  There is a rape and murder in the countryside.  The story of what happened is related by four witnesses including, in a very impressive use of make-up, the deceased himself.  Everyone's story is slanted towards their role in the events.  The participants tend to see themselves as victims and so the truth looks different depending on who is telling the story.  This is the magnificence of the movie.There are three persons who serve as a sort of narration and editorial team which helps give the movie greater impact.  The story begins in a poring rain with the story-line just as dismal.

(Worse, what brought the original viewing back is Machiko Kyo's vastly annoying derisive laugh about three-quarters through, a sound that grates on my nerves even worse than Julianne Moore's hideous faked cough in Safe.) That said, and taking the fact that I'd forgotten I'd seen the film before into account, it's a pretty good little flick.The story: A bandit accosts a man and wife on their way through the woods. The husband winds up dead. Simple, right? Well, no. Not really. The story is told from four different perspectives, and those perspectives are related secondhand through the experiences of a trio of travellers who have been thrown together by coincidence during a rainstorm. It's the unreliable narrator, but fractured and diffused to the point where no one-- including the traveller who, it has been hypothesized by some, is the actual killer-- knows what's real and what isn't. The idea here, according to most critics, is that Kurosawa was examining life and our perceptions of it-- the idea that nothing we know is true in any empirical sense, that all of it is filtered through our perceptions. True enough. And it's certainly not a bad film; it's rich, complex, well-acted (well, except for that laugh), well-directed, and fun to watch. But I'm not sure why it gets so much more attention that a number of other, more brilliant, Kurosawa films (Ikiru is the obvious contemporary choice).

Is this the first film to fully embrace relativism?Certainly somewhat existential and post modern in its central conceit, this exceptionally absorbing drama still resonates with a timely and provocative tale of the illusive nature of so-called Truth.Through an ingenious use of camera and flashbacks, Kurosawa reveals the seemingly paradoxical complexities of human nature as four people -- all witnesses to one degree or another -- recount different versions of the story of a man's murder and the rape of his wife. Toshiro Mifune gives another commanding performance in this eloquent masterwork that secured his international stardom.With a restored image and sound, this classic revolutionized film language and introduced Japanese cinema to a global audience. Loaded with extras, including a video introduction by Robert Altman and a brilliant commentary by Japanese film historian Donald Richie. Excerpts are also included from ""The World of Kazuo Miyagawa,"" a documentary about Rashomon's incredible cinematographer.Even in the pantheon of our greatest filmmakers, Kurosawa stands apart as an intellectual and an artist.

This film, of course, was the inspiration for the Paul Newman Western, 'The Outrage', so if imitation is the highest form of flattery this fascinating film has been flattered plenty.It is redundant to point out that this film tells the tale of a rape and murder told from four separate points of view i.e. 1.  the rapist  2.  the raped woman  3. the murdered husband via a medium and 4. an unseen witness.  All 'testimonies' vary as to the facts and the points of view.  Unlike the 'Outrage', though, the bare 'facts' aren't enormously variable.  The bandit 1. ties up the husband and rapes his beautiful wife in front of his eyes.  2.  The husband ends up dead.  3.  the wife may or may not have put up an initial struggle but sometime during the 'rape' she seems to have passively, if not actively, yielded/participated with her ravisher  4.  The husband, before his death, is appalled/horrified/contemptuous of what has happened to his wife or his wife's pleasure in it.The questions revolve around the details.  Did the wife demand a duel to decide who would get her?  Did she simply insist on her husband's execution?  Did she slay her own husband, herself, unable to take the contempt in his eyes?The questions are subtle enough to gain different interpretations or misinterpretations.  Lie, Truth and simple misinterpretation are explored.  There are no real villains only perpetrators and/or victims.  In one version [the bandit's] the husband comes out as something as a hero, dying manfully in a duel.  Otherwise--at one level or another--all three are at some level complicit.

354641,AY3AVLL5IWW9,6303073107,Russell Fanelli,"[12, 17]","In the first chapter of Burton F. Porter's excellent new book, Philosophy through Fiction and Film, he discusses the problem of obtaining reliable knowledge and he uses Akira Kurosawa's ground breaking film, Rashomon, to illustrate the difficulty of determining the truth value of what we think we see and know.  Professor Porter gives us a careful summary of the film with his thoughtful comments on the challenge of knowing the absolute truth about what we experience.When asked about what he knew for certain, Albert Einstein said that the only thing he could be certain of was the speed of light, and even that was open to question.  Kurosawa and Einstein appear to be in accord and Rashomon is Kurosawa's attempt to show how difficult it is to know the truth of what actually happened, even when an event is viewed by several eyewitnesses.Rashomon is now available on DVD, courtesy of the Criterion Collection of Films, and the black and white print we see on the screen is sharp and clear and the sound is good.  This film does not translate well to the small televison screen.  I sat up close to my 32"" Panasonic and wished I had a larger TV so that I might be drawn in more completely as a witness to the complex and engaging story.The movie opens at the Rashomon Gate in feudal Japan.  A woodcutter and a priest are sitting patiently waiting for a rainstorm to subside.  Soon another man, a commoner, joins them and the woodcutter begins to share with the two other men his confusion about the facts surrounding a recent rape and murder.  We learn later that the woodcutter is an eyewitness to the crimes, but first he tells us about his experience as he watches intently an investigation/trial.  A judge is listening to a bandit, a woman, and a dead samurai, whose testimony is revealed through a medium, tell the judge their version of the rape and murder.The bandit first tells us he is reponsible for rape of the woman and the death of the samurai.  Next the woman seems to indicate that she might be responsible for the death of the samurai, her husband.  Then the samurai, by means of a medium, indicates that he committed suicide.  Finally, the woodcutter tells us that the bandit is indeed responsible for the murder.  Each of these stories is visually recreated in effective flashbacks.Lest any viewer think this problem is factual and straight forward, all the viewer needs to do is to write out his version of the various stories and then check with what even well respected critics have to say to see that the viewer's version will differ sometimes signficantly from various professional reviews.  Kurosawa demonstrates convincingly that in the telling of events each viewer is likely to put forward a version that enhances the way that viewer is perceived by others.  This film is about truth and lies and the point made is that the person we are most likely to be untruthful to is ourself.  If we are unable to tell the truth to ourselves, how will we be able to be honest with others?Everthing we see and experience is filtered through the total experience of our lives.  In a world filled with competing stimuli, where do we focus our attention?  We miss more than we see, sometimes even things right under our very noses.  Reality is fabulous, as in this Kurosawa film, but he shows us that it is also as ephemeral as the light passing through the trees in the forest creating shadows everywhere.Rashomon was made for a Japanese audience and was very popular in Japan. In 1951 it was shown at the Venice Film Festival and won the Golden Lion Award.  Since that time it has taken its place among the finest films ever made.It is not without its flaws, chief of which, in my opinion, is the music score, particularly the adaptation of Ravel's Bolero, which distracts the viewer from the events taking place on screen.  Also, at the very end of the film a baby is found at the Rashomon Gate and the woodcutter takes the baby home to add to his large family.  This plot device to soften the negative impact of the film on the audience and to give hope where little has been experienced weakens the impact of all the events in the story we have just seen.  For a film meant to be shown to a Japanese audience, this ""Hollywood"" ending seems out of place and untrue.The greatness of the film is the story it tells and the superb perfomances of all the actors.  I cannot agree with critics who feel that some of the perfomances of the actors, particularly the bandit, were ""over the top.""  This film is a highly visual, almost a throwback to silent pictures.  We learn about the characters from what we see more than from what we hear.  Additionally, the superb camera work is a most important part of the story telling process.Rashomon is a must for students of the cinema and, as was mentioned earlier in this review, for anyone interested in trying to learn the truth value of knowledge.",5,"""What is truth?""",1059264000,"07 27, 2003",2003,4908,"['first', 'chapter', 'Burton', 'F.', 'Porter', 'excellent', 'new', 'book', 'Philosophy', 'Fiction', 'Film', 'problem', 'obtaining', 'reliable', 'knowledge', 'Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'ground', 'breaking', 'film', 'Rashomon', 'illustrate', 'difficulty', 'determining', 'truth', 'value', 'what', 'think', 'see', 'know', 'Professor', 'Porter', 'careful', 'summary', 'film', 'thoughtful', 'comments', 'challenge', 'knowing', 'absolute', 'truth', 'what', 'experience.When', 'asked', 'what', 'knew', 'certain', 'Albert', 'Einstein', 'said', 'only', 'thing', 'could', 'be', 'certain', 'was', 'speed', 'light', 'even', 'was', 'open', 'question', 'Kurosawa', 'Einstein', 'appear', 'be', 'accord', 'Rashomon', 'Kurosawa', 'attempt', 'show', 'how', 'difficult', 'know', 'truth', 'what', 'actually', 'happened', 'even', 'when', 'event', 'viewed', 'several', 'eyewitnesses.Rashomon', 'now', 'available', 'DVD', 'courtesy', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'Films', 'black', 'white', 'print', 'see', 'screen', 'sharp', 'clear', 'sound', 'good', 'film', 'not', 'translate', 'well', 'small', 'televison', 'screen', 'sat', 'up', 'close', '32', 'Panasonic', 'wished', 'had', 'larger', 'TV', 'might', 'be', 'drawn', 'more', 'completely', 'witness', 'complex', 'engaging', 'story.The', 'movie', 'Rashomon', 'Gate', 'feudal', 'Japan', 'A', 'woodcutter', 'priest', 'are', 'sitting', 'patiently', 'waiting', 'rainstorm', 'subside', 'Soon', 'man', 'commoner', 'woodcutter', 'share', 'two', 'other', 'men', 'confusion', 'facts', 'surrounding', 'recent', 'rape', 'murder', 'learn', 'later', 'woodcutter', 'eyewitness', 'crimes', 'first', 'experience', 'intently', 'investigation/trial', 'judge', 'listening', 'bandit', 'woman', 'dead', 'samurai', 'testimony', 'revealed', 'medium', 'tell', 'judge', 'version', 'rape', 'murder.The', 'bandit', 'first', 'reponsible', 'rape', 'woman', 'death', 'samurai', 'woman', 'indicate', 'might', 'be', 'responsible', 'death', 'samurai', 'husband', 'Then', 'samurai', 'means', 'medium', 'committed', 'suicide', 'Finally', 'woodcutter', 'bandit', 'indeed', 'responsible', 'murder', 'stories', 'visually', 'recreated', 'effective', 'flashbacks.Lest', 'viewer', 'think', 'problem', 'factual', 'straight', 'forward', 'viewer', 'do', 'write', 'out', 'version', 'various', 'stories', 'then', 'check', 'what', 'even', 'well', 'respected', 'critics', 'have', 'say', 'see', 'viewer', 'version', 'will', 'differ', 'sometimes', 'signficantly', 'various', 'professional', 'reviews', 'Kurosawa', 'convincingly', 'telling', 'events', 'viewer', 'likely', 'put', 'forward', 'version', 'way', 'viewer', 'perceived', 'others', 'film', 'truth', 'lies', 'point', 'made', 'person', 'are', 'most', 'likely', 'be', 'untruthful', 'are', 'unable', 'tell', 'truth', 'ourselves', 'how', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'be', 'honest', 'others', 'Everthing', 'see', 'experience', 'filtered', 'total', 'experience', 'lives', 'world', 'filled', 'competing', 'stimuli', 'where', 'do', 'focus', 'attention', 'miss', 'more', 'see', 'sometimes', 'even', 'things', 'right', 'very', 'noses', 'Reality', 'fabulous', 'Kurosawa', 'film', 'also', 'as', 'ephemeral', 'light', 'passing', 'trees', 'forest', 'creating', 'shadows', 'everywhere.Rashomon', 'was', 'made', 'Japanese', 'audience', 'was', 'very', 'popular', 'Japan', '1951', 'was', 'shown', 'Venice', 'Film', 'Festival', 'won', 'Golden', 'Lion', 'Award', 'time', 'taken', 'place', 'finest', 'films', 'ever', 'made.It', 'not', 'flaws', 'chief', 'opinion', 'music', 'score', 'particularly', 'adaptation', 'Ravel', 'Bolero', 'viewer', 'events', 'taking', 'place', 'screen', 'Also', 'very', 'end', 'film', 'baby', 'found', 'Rashomon', 'Gate', 'woodcutter', 'baby', 'home', 'add', 'large', 'family', 'plot', 'device', 'soften', 'negative', 'impact', 'film', 'audience', 'give', 'hope', 'where', 'little', 'been', 'experienced', 'impact', 'events', 'story', 'have', 'just', 'seen', 'film', 'meant', 'be', 'shown', 'Japanese', 'audience', 'Hollywood', 'ending', 'place', 'untrue.The', 'greatness', 'film', 'story', 'superb', 'perfomances', 'actors', 'can', 'not', 'agree', 'critics', 'who', 'feel', 'perfomances', 'actors', 'particularly', 'bandit', 'were', 'top', 'film', 'highly', 'visual', 'almost', 'throwback', 'silent', 'pictures', 'learn', 'characters', 'what', 'see', 'more', 'what', 'hear', 'Additionally', 'superb', 'camera', 'work', 'most', 'important', 'part', 'story', 'telling', 'process.Rashomon', 'must', 'students', 'cinema', 'was', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'review', 'anyone', 'interested', 'trying', 'learn', 'truth', 'value', 'knowledge']",Rashomon VHS

The scene where he pulls slowly at the leather thong to which his sword is tied as he looks up into the dazzling light filtering down through the leaves...that slow movement to evil, caused by the heat and one breath of air.The rain that relentlessly batters the Rashomon gate forms another plot point, and sets the mood..one feels completely paralyzed....the poor humans grappling to understand the complex distortions of the horrible human drama..are frozen by their inability to understand why the story is different, depending of who tells it..and unable to leave the story alone...paralyzed from shaking it off by the rain which forces them into contemplation as they sit under the rotting gate.Some trickery going on, here. Why do the stories differ? A simple answer, and the one Kurosawa gave to his uncomprehending assistant directors was that we all invent our own little worlds, and our version of a story flatters our own self-concept.The bandit wishes to be seen as bold and powerful, beyond the confines of law. The husband, confronted with the rape, wishes to see himself as wrongfully betrayed by his wife. The wife wishes to see herself as victim. The woodcutter, when finally confronted, wishes to ""tell the truth"".The film puts ""the truth"" into a relativistic purgatory, and is unfathomable, and yet, completely truthful. The mental pretzels one can make trying to figure out the ""truth"" are less satisfying than the experience and acceptance of the story as it plays out. Hey, there are some things in life you are just not going to know.Kurosawa missed the beauty of the silent cinema, and aimed, in this film, to bring back a way of storytelling that depended on visual cues, camera movement, shot compostion and acting rather than dialogue to produce the film's power and emotion. This is surely one of the most exquisitely filmed works of all cinema, so sensitively photographed that the shades of grey suggest colors...!I see Mifune's eyes, lit by a reflection of the sun from a mirror laced with foilage (a trick the cinematographer used to increase the available light in the forest while retaining the proper ""leaf-filtered"" quality of the light) in color. His eyes appear chestnut.There is no way to understand the communication of color in a black and white film, other than to say that the communication of seeing is so fulsome, that nothing seems missing, and hey! That's kinda like the film, huh? We invent our reality.Rashomon is the film that catapulted Japanese film into the international cinematic consciousness, made a reputation for Kurosawa, launched Mifune to international stardom, and revolutionized cinematography.The sun and rain on Rashomon gate are there for you.

RASHOMON tells the same story from different sources: the  dead husband ghost; his wife; the bandit; the peasant and leaves it all up  to you to justify and select your version of truth-in-itself, if any, out  of these four. Each one told the story just in ways to suggest own  benefits, leading us to comtemplate which one is just more or less true, if  any of these is true at all ( I know it sounds absurd for one to find it  more or less true, yet no kidding ! ).Considered to be way too  avant-garde in its own decade the movie was originally released, due to the  non-conventional story-telling sequence / screenplay ( More or less like  Pulp Fiction's ) Rashomon was artistically portrayed in ways to  continuously provoke viewers' thoughts wittily with the sublime performance  by the main characters under magnificent light use within the tensed  atmosphere wherever appropriate.The film will suit best the following  viewer types: 1) Unconventional die-hard moviehead; 2) Film-making school  student; 3) Movie critic; 4) Any art house movie lover; et alFrom this  film and others including Seven Samurai, The Hidden Fortress, Yojimbo, Ran,  etc. Kurosawa sensei ( master ) is probably the best conventional director  of all time.

354649,AQQLWCMRNDFGI,6303073107,Steven A. Peterson,"[3, 3]","""Rashomon"" is one of the great movies for the ages.  It challenges us to think about what ""reality"" might be, and leads us to wonder if we can truly comprehend ""reality.""Let me begin this review with a fragment about postmodern perspectives.  One key point here is that subject and object cannot be separated.  We cannot ""get outside"" ourselves in order to objectively observe the world around us--including the world of human affairs. This is oversimplified, of course, but it provides one lens through which to consider Akira Kurosawa's great work, ""Rashomon.""This 1950 film, starring Toshiro Mifune as a bandit, is based on what seems to be a straightforward event. A samurai is killed and his wife raped. The movie starts with three people seeking refuge from a heavy rain under a decayed gate in 12th century Japan.  The three: a woodcutter, a priest, and a peasant.  They begin talking about the incident just noted.Then, we see the murder and rape through the eyes of the three people involved--the samurai, his wife, and the bandit.  And each version (the dead samurai's version is provided through a medium) differs remarkably from the other two.  In short, we have three eyewitnesses telling of a fundamentally different event.  So, what is reality?  That is the question at stake.  And, to make matters even murkier, the woodcutter finally mentions that he had observed the whole scene himself--and his view was different still!  Thus, four very distinct interpretations of a single event.  The woodcutter's version might seem most plausible, but then he trips himself up by revealing something that raises questions about his motives.Why speak of a postmodern perspective earlier in this review?  Because postmodernists argue that it is difficult for people to step outside themselves and  their unique perspectives and biases to observe ""objective reality."" And contemporary psychologists tell us the same: humans are remarkably able to distort reality to protect self-image and make their motives appear to be good (and competitors' to be not so good).

Establishing who is responsible for what and what truly happened proves difficult, if not impossible.  Through a series of flashbacks and stories-within-stories we come close to learning the `truth,' learning the limitations of `truth' in the process.I approached RASHOMON with a certain amount of trepidation.  I watched it years and years ago and don't remember much about the first viewing.  I'm happy to report that RASHOMON can be enjoyed without notepad or textbook.  It's a beautiful looking black-and-white film that was more or less Kurosawa favorite Toshiro Mifune's coming out movie.  Mifune plays the Thief with a full palette.  As the various stories unfold, the Thief ranges from noble to craven, from hysterical to plotting.  Sometimes Mifune seems a little... excessive to me, but sooner or later I catch up with what he's doing.  In other words, he's brilliant, and repeated viewings won't catch him playing it false.  And if there's ever been a movie that rewards repeat viewers, it's RASHOMON.There are classics and there are Classics, and Akira Kurosawa's RASHOMON is a 600-pound lumbering giant of a Classic.  Capital-C Classics can be a little intimidating and more than a little disappointing.  RASHOMON can be enjoyed without digging deep into it.  The commentary track by Donald Richie is informative, if a little didactic.  He tends to tell us what we're seeing, although he compensates by also letting us know what to look for in repeated viewings.  The introduction by Robert Altman could probably have been dispensed with without too much harm - basically it's six minutes of Altman telling us how much he likes the movie.

In my opinion, and the opinion of thousands of people who have watched Rashomon over the years, this film is a bona fide masterpiece. But even though thousands of people agree that this film is one of the very best ever made, does that mean that my opinion and the opinions of those thousands are true? No, it doesn't. We all are subjective humans prone to errors and biases, and ""truth"" is something that may be completely out of our grasp. Are we viewing truth or just a convincing illusion that everyone agrees on? This is one of the many questions that Rashomon poses.If we try to be as objective as we can and at least form criteria to judge this film a masterpiece, we could check off some of these questions as yes or no.Does this film really make you think? Yes. In fact, it forces you to think. After all, as the viewer, you're trying to figure out who murdered and raped somebody.Does this film have truly stunning cinematography and camerawork? Yes, some of the best ever. Especially for a film released in 1950.Does this film have incredible actors in it? Yes, Toshiro Mifune and Takashi Shimura are both in this film, two of the very best actors you'll come across.Is this film directed exceptionably? Yes, Akira Kurosawa. Enough said. This artist directed superb films like bees make honey.Does this film actually have an ""Effect"" named after it? Yes, it does. Not many movies can say that.Does this film continue to influence TV, movies, books, and even scientific research to this day? Yes, without a doubt. You've probably seen something or read something using Rashomon in some way, and you didn't know it.I'll give a brief synopsis. A murder and rape occur out in the woods. Someone is accused of committing both crimes, and a trial is held. There are four ""witnesses"" who give their own accounts of what happened that day. The problem is that all of the accounts contradict each other in some way. Even after hearing the rape victim testify, you are not even convinced that a rape occurred because she says a lot of things that are self-serving and things already demonstrated to be false. What in the name of the Rashomon gate really happened? Which story is correct?The unreliability of eyewitness testimony is now something firmly documented by science, but at the time Kurosawa made this film, it wasn't. In fact, eyewitness testimony was once considered the bedrock of the justice system, something unassailable and key to proving or disproving a case. Now, of course, we know that an eyewitness account is vulnerable to all sorts of things, most of which can't be avoided. People can view the same event happen, and not one person's account of what happened will completely match another. And people can be made to ""see"" things happen that they didn't actually witness, a fact born out by current research as well. The fallibility of human perception is now beyond dispute. So how can we know the ""truth""?As with all great art, this movie poses great questions that don't have easy answers, if there are any answers at all.Did you see what you think you saw? Is your memory of an event accurate? We'd like to think so, but it is itself a human bias to fool ourselves with comforting illusions to protect our own egos. At least being aware that our brains aren't all they are made out to be can at least help us on the road to truth.The Criterion Collection edition is great, lots of extras, interviews, etc. It's well worth the extra money.If ""Ikiru"" is Kurosawa's heart, then ""Rashomon"" is Kurosawa's brain.

Well known and regarded for his classic samurai films, Kurosawa's rich and sharply observed personal films are often overlooked by most fans of Japanese cinema. It has more to do with Kurosawa's unconventional approach to storytelling than anything else. Like Hitchcock, Truffaut, Kubrick and Spielberg, Kurosawa uses the camera as truth detector. When a young woman is raped and her husband is killed, we are asked to interpret their various stories and figure out who's telling the truth. We realize, in the process, that everyone and no one is being completely truthful for a variety of selfish personal choices. We also begin to question the subjective nature of truth and personal observation about the world.Mifune is marvelous as the rapist/killer/lover (you decide which hat he truly wears)in an unexpected role. He's just as compelling here as he was in The Seven Samurai and other Kurosawa epics.The Criterion transfer is crisp rendering the black and white photographer in stark, sharp images whose beauty belies the ugly truth underneath it all. The extras include a running commentary by a Kurosawa scholar and loads of goodies including the original US run theatrical trailer. Given the age of the film and condition of the negative, the transfer is nearly flawless having none of the flaws I've seen in many video transfers and new prints of the film.I'd highly recommend Rashomon for fans of Japanese cinema as well as anyone who likes entertainment to be more than a giant meatball.",5,The elusive nature of truth,1037318400,"11 15, 2002",2002,1617,"['film', 'subjective', 'nature', 'truth', 'Rashomon', 'startlingly', 'original', 'film', 'Japanese', 'director', 'Kurosawa', 'Well', 'known', 'regarded', 'classic', 'samurai', 'films', 'Kurosawa', 'rich', 'sharply', 'observed', 'personal', 'films', 'are', 'often', 'overlooked', 'most', 'fans', 'Japanese', 'cinema', 'more', 'do', 'Kurosawa', 'unconventional', 'approach', 'storytelling', 'anything', 'else', 'Hitchcock', 'Truffaut', 'Kubrick', 'Spielberg', 'Kurosawa', 'camera', 'truth', 'detector', 'When', 'young', 'woman', 'raped', 'husband', 'killed', 'are', 'asked', 'interpret', 'various', 'stories', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'telling', 'truth', 'realize', 'process', 'everyone', 'one', 'being', 'completely', 'truthful', 'variety', 'selfish', 'personal', 'choices', 'also', 'begin', 'question', 'subjective', 'nature', 'truth', 'personal', 'observation', 'world.Mifune', 'marvelous', 'rapist/killer/lover', 'decide', 'hat', 'truly', 'unexpected', 'role', 'just', 'compelling', 'here', 'was', 'Seven', 'Samurai', 'other', 'Kurosawa', 'Criterion', 'transfer', 'crisp', 'rendering', 'black', 'white', 'photographer', 'stark', 'sharp', 'images', 'beauty', 'ugly', 'truth', 'extras', 'include', 'running', 'commentary', 'Kurosawa', 'scholar', 'loads', 'goodies', 'including', 'original', 'US', 'run', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'Given', 'age', 'film', 'condition', 'negative', 'transfer', 'nearly', 'flawless', 'having', 'none', 'flaws', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', 'video', 'transfers', 'new', 'prints', 'film.I', ""'d"", 'highly', 'recommend', 'Rashomon', 'fans', 'Japanese', 'cinema', 'as', 'well', 'anyone', 'who', 'entertainment', 'be', 'more', 'giant', 'meatball']",Rashomon VHS
354658,A1IFHFXIHESV28,6303073107,"William M. Feagin ""music dealer/geek""","[8, 8]","Rashomon (1950; directed by Akira Kurosawa and starring Toshiro Mifune) is one of those films that the truly hip have seen, and not many others; rather like certain books--On the Road, The Satanic Verses, One Hundred Years of Solitude, Naked Lunch--it has a certain hip cache, being one that cineastes have all seen and can discuss in great detail.  Name-droppers know they need only mention the name in a knowledgeable context to be viewed with awe.In truth, however, Rashomon is the sort of film that everyone should see; it's a true classic, in a league with Casablanca, Citizen Kane and others.  The film examines truth, in the context of a rape and murder in 12th Century Japan, from four different perspectives; a woodcutter who witnessed the whole incident yet was afraid to report it, the bandit who committed the crime, the murdered man's ghost (through a medium) and the rape victim (the murdered man's wife).  There are a few elements which remain constant from each version of the story--that the murdered man was tied up and forced to watch the bandit ravish his wife, and that he did indeed die--but how he died varies.  It was either a swordfight with the bandit, at his wife's hand with a dagger, or suicide resulting from his being absolutely crushed by his wife choosing to leave with the bandit.  Did she demand his death?  Did he look at her with scorn after the crime?  Was she really raped or did she yield consensually to the bandit?  Honesty is also explored in detail, with the wife's honesty being most in question, but also with the three men sheltering from a rainstorm at the ruined gate of Rashomon who relate the story between themselves.This was one of the late Toshiro Mifune's (1920-1997) first collaborations with Akira Kurosawa, and his criminally-insane Tajomaru is masterfully acted.  So effective is Mifune's acting that you truly loathe Tajomaru; you're torn between pity and disgust for the wife (Masahiko Kyo, also a brilliant actress), and there are truly few really sympathetic characters among the cast here.  The camera work is exemplary, shows what Kurosawa was best known for--unusual perspectives in some truly arresting shots, proving that his eye for detail was as sharp in black and white as it would later be in colour (cf. Dersu Uzala, Kagemusha, and Ran, 3 latter-day Kurosawa masterpieces).  Absolutely worth seeing, and proof of the saying that there are three sides to every story (to wit:  mine, yours, and what really happened)--but also proving that what really happened isn't even ever certain.",5,One of the greatest foreign films ever...,1162944000,"11 8, 2006",2006,2556,"['Rashomon', '1950', 'directed', 'Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'starring', 'Toshiro', 'Mifune', 'one', 'films', 'truly', 'hip', 'have', 'seen', 'not', 'many', 'others', 'rather', 'certain', 'books', 'Road', 'Satanic', 'Verses', 'One', 'Hundred', 'Years', 'Solitude', 'Naked', 'Lunch', 'certain', 'hip', 'cache', 'being', 'one', 'have', 'seen', 'can', 'discuss', 'great', 'detail', 'Name-droppers', 'know', 'need', 'only', 'mention', 'name', 'knowledgeable', 'context', 'be', 'viewed', 'awe.In', 'truth', 'however', 'Rashomon', 'sort', 'film', 'everyone', 'should', 'see', 'true', 'classic', 'league', 'Casablanca', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'others', 'film', 'examines', 'truth', 'context', 'rape', 'murder', '12th', 'Century', 'Japan', 'four', 'different', 'perspectives', 'woodcutter', 'who', 'witnessed', 'whole', 'incident', 'yet', 'was', 'afraid', 'report', 'bandit', 'who', 'committed', 'crime', 'murdered', 'man', 'ghost', 'medium', 'rape', 'victim', 'murdered', 'man', 'wife', 'are', 'few', 'elements', 'remain', 'constant', 'version', 'story', 'murdered', 'man', 'was', 'tied', 'up', 'forced', 'watch', 'bandit', 'ravish', 'wife', 'did', 'indeed', 'die', 'how', 'died', 'varies', 'was', 'swordfight', 'bandit', 'wife', 'hand', 'dagger', 'suicide', 'resulting', 'being', 'absolutely', 'crushed', 'wife', 'choosing', 'leave', 'bandit', 'Did', 'demand', 'death', 'Did', 'look', 'scorn', 'crime', 'Was', 'really', 'raped', 'did', 'yield', 'consensually', 'bandit', 'Honesty', 'also', 'explored', 'detail', 'wife', 'honesty', 'being', 'most', 'question', 'also', 'three', 'men', 'sheltering', 'rainstorm', 'ruined', 'gate', 'Rashomon', 'who', 'relate', 'story', 'themselves.This', 'was', 'one', 'late', 'Toshiro', 'Mifune', '1920-1997', 'first', 'collaborations', 'Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'criminally-insane', 'Tajomaru', 'masterfully', 'acted', 'So', 'effective', 'Mifune', 'acting', 'truly', 'loathe', 'Tajomaru', ""'re"", 'torn', 'pity', 'disgust', 'wife', 'Masahiko', 'Kyo', 'also', 'brilliant', 'actress', 'are', 'truly', 'few', 'really', 'sympathetic', 'characters', 'cast', 'here', 'camera', 'work', 'exemplary', 'what', 'Kurosawa', 'was', 'best', 'known', 'unusual', 'perspectives', 'truly', 'arresting', 'shots', 'proving', 'eye', 'detail', 'was', 'sharp', 'black', 'white', 'would', 'later', 'be', 'colour', 'cf', 'Dersu', 'Uzala', 'Kagemusha', 'Ran', '3', 'latter-day', 'Kurosawa', 'masterpieces', 'Absolutely', 'worth', 'seeing', 'proof', 'saying', 'are', 'three', 'sides', 'story', 'wit', 'mine', 'yours', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'also', 'proving', 'what', 'really', 'happened', ""n't"", 'even', 'ever', 'certain']",Rashomon VHS

Kurosawa attempted to re-capture the beauty of silent films, with their focus on imagery over dialog.  The twisting plot, the characters, all combing to make a unique viewing experience.  Mifune is wild, larger than life.  I have heard that each actor in &quot;Roshomon&quot; was given a traditional Noh mask on which to base their character.  It is a considered film.Criterion's Kurosawa DVDs get a little better with every release.  &quot;Roshomon&quot; surpasses earlier releases with a cavalcade of extras.  The Robert Altman interview is nice, comparable to the George Lucas interview for &quot;Hidden Fortress.&quot;  I appreciate Donald Richie's commentary.  I wish that other Criterion Kurosawa DVDs had his commentary recorded.  There is a nice documentary on the cinematographer.My favorite extra is the collection of the original stories &quot;Roshomon&quot; and &quot;In the Grove.&quot;  They are in booklet form, and not electronic as I feared.I am excited for Criterion to release more Kurosawa on DVD.

The actors act like savages, lacking the human values that are found in our culture. But as I got further into the movie I realized that there is much that we can learn from other cultures. A recent documentary told the story of our female soldiers who were  routinely being raped by male soldiers in a war zone and the top brass routinely covered it up. How would the Japanese react to this news? Even more important, how does the US population react to this story or to the fact that many US states are passing legislation to make it impossible for women to have an abortion or to use contraceptives?",5,Viewing A Foreign Culture From the Inside Can Be Frightening,1366761600,"04 24, 2013",2013,709,"['what', 'happened', 'Rashomon', 'where', 'women', 'seem', 'have', 'rights', 'men', 'are', 'always', 'fighting', 'actors', 'act', 'savages', 'lacking', 'human', 'values', 'are', 'found', 'culture', 'got', 'further', 'movie', 'realized', 'much', 'can', 'learn', 'other', 'cultures', 'recent', 'documentary', 'told', 'story', 'female', 'soldiers', 'who', 'were', 'routinely', 'being', 'raped', 'male', 'soldiers', 'war', 'zone', 'top', 'brass', 'routinely', 'covered', 'up', 'How', 'would', 'Japanese', 'react', 'news', 'Even', 'more', 'important', 'how', 'US', 'population', 'react', 'story', 'fact', 'many', 'US', 'states', 'are', 'passing', 'legislation', 'make', 'impossible', 'women', 'have', 'abortion', 'use', 'contraceptives']",Rashomon VHS
354661,A25JBPU5G0C29H,6303073107,Zev Bazarov,"[8, 11]","Akira Kurosawa, known as one of the greatest directors of all time, got international attention with this film, that opened up the Japanese film market to the world. Released in 1950, this film, along with the director won many coveted awards. The story is simple, but at the same time the film is very complex. Tajomaru, a bandit, played wonderfully by the great Toshiro Mifune, is accused of raping a woman, and murdering her husband, in the woods. Tajomaru, the woman, a witness, and the man himself (speaking through a medium) tell their version of the events. The thing is each one tells a different story, with their own perspective on the events, and perception of those involved. So as each story is told we go into flashback and see the different events, and how the characters act differently.The film from a technical standpoint is perfect, with innovative use of the camera, and editing. Acting is done superbly, with each actor, playing a slightly different version of their characters in each flashback. The script cannot get better, based on two short stories. The film is very serious, and is a meditation on the nature of truth.Its about how truth is relative, and how we each have a different viewing of events, tastes, and concepts. It is also about how each person makes up their own truth, lies, to deceive themselves. Our ego is so big we need to comfort it, and keep it safe from harsh reality. In all this film is perfect, and is even sometime called Japan's Citizen Kane, in the way it impacted Japanese filming. The two films have many similarities. If you enjoy serious films, investigating the nature of truth, and ourselves, see this film. 5 stars.",5,Kurosawa's breakthrough film,1039651200,"12 12, 2002",2002,1677,"['Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'known', 'one', 'greatest', 'directors', 'time', 'got', 'international', 'attention', 'film', 'opened', 'up', 'Japanese', 'film', 'market', 'world', 'Released', '1950', 'film', 'director', 'won', 'many', 'coveted', 'awards', 'story', 'simple', 'same', 'time', 'film', 'very', 'complex', 'Tajomaru', 'bandit', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'great', 'Toshiro', 'Mifune', 'accused', 'raping', 'woman', 'murdering', 'husband', 'woods', 'Tajomaru', 'woman', 'witness', 'man', 'speaking', 'medium', 'tell', 'version', 'events', 'thing', 'one', 'different', 'story', 'own', 'perspective', 'events', 'perception', 'involved', 'So', 'story', 'told', 'go', 'flashback', 'see', 'different', 'events', 'how', 'characters', 'act', 'differently.The', 'film', 'technical', 'standpoint', 'perfect', 'innovative', 'use', 'camera', 'editing', 'Acting', 'done', 'superbly', 'actor', 'playing', 'slightly', 'different', 'version', 'characters', 'flashback', 'script', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'better', 'based', 'two', 'short', 'stories', 'film', 'very', 'serious', 'meditation', 'nature', 'truth.Its', 'how', 'truth', 'relative', 'how', 'have', 'different', 'viewing', 'events', 'tastes', 'concepts', 'also', 'how', 'person', 'up', 'own', 'truth', 'deceive', 'ego', 'so', 'big', 'need', 'comfort', 'keep', 'safe', 'harsh', 'reality', 'film', 'perfect', 'even', 'sometime', 'called', 'Japan', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'way', 'impacted', 'Japanese', 'filming', 'two', 'films', 'have', 'many', 'similarities', 'enjoy', 'serious', 'films', 'investigating', 'nature', 'truth', 'see', 'film', '5', 'stars']",Rashomon VHS
