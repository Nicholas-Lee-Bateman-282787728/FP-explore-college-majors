972612,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000EGEKRO,A Customer,"[13, 15]","The fifteen-year-old Duncan (Emile Hirsch) and his laconic father Edgar Mudge (Richard Jenkins) are reeling after the death of the most important person in their life. Duncan's mother and Edgar's wife died suddenly, whilst biking some farm eggs to her neighbor.  An alcoholic, she was the glue that tethered this family together, and her death has left Duncan and Edgar emotionally fragile and at a loss.It isn't only his wife's passing that is bothering Edgar; he notices that Duncan's a ""different"" kind of boy - sensitive, kindly and delicate. Duncan constantly dotes on his pet chicken and dresses in his mother's clothes, perhaps in an effort to stay connected to him mom.  At church - where he sings out of tune  - a neighbor in their tiny farm community comments on how Duncan is the spitting image of his mom.Duncan is soft, not in an effeminate way; it's just that he has an intuitiveness and a compassion that places him at odds with some of the older and rougher boys, who mock him, and call him ""weird"" and question his sexuality, something he's already tormented over. Was Duncan a mama's boy? Well, we're not really sure. Obviously there was incredible love between them both, but it's a love that his father is unable to replicate.Edgar worries about his son and he loves him dearly, but he's is clueless about how to help him. He tries to get him to help out around the farm in an effort to toughen him up. He also encourages Duncan to go out with his older friends, the ringleader of which is Perry (Tom Guiry), a butch and macho town stud who likes to brag about his sexual conquests. Perry's bravado is a cover-up for his scary feelings toward Duncan, and it's only a matter of time before their relationship reaches a crisis.Mudge Boy is the perfect example of understatement, a tale of bourgeoning same sex attraction, and also a titular exploration of the isolation of farm life. Deeply religious, Edgar could be the fire and brimstone type of father; instead he's a thoughtful, considerate and caring man, who is at a loss at how to deal with his eccentric son. Hirsch, who projects a shy modesty, is perfectly cast as Duncan - a boy who is somewhat out of his depth with the people around him, an outcast with many quirks and eccentricities.At times, Mudge Boy can be difficult to watch, there's a quasi-rape scene, where the result of some teenage sexual experimentation reaches an ugly climax. But writer-director Michael Burke is always sensitive to his subject matter, beautifully rendering his protagonists' dysfunctions and setting them against a bucolic backdrop of Vermont farm land with it's meadows, tumbling down barns and cow patches.Whether Duncan is sweetly ingratiating himself and getting drunk with the local in crowd, or sucking on the head of his pet chicken, he's a character who many of us will probably be able to relate to. He's desperate to fit in, confused about his bourgeoning sexuality and is undoubtedly a troubled and confused soul. The final denouement, when Duncan is forced to confront the evils of small town bigotry is absolutely heart wrenching, as is the teary and world-weary reconciliation with his father.

972618,A4XFOO76EOYPC,B000EGEKRO,"B ME ""B ME""","[12, 15]","There have been some very good reviews written giving the synopsis so I won't re-hash that.  This is a very disquieting movie - social isolation in rural isolation, and themes of not fitting in. No emotional attachment/connections are apparent until the 2 main characters meet.  It is interesting how the relationship develops - being referred to as a friend by Perry (even as a throw-away line) starts the ""relationship"".The wedding dress/barn scene is truly disturbing. And yet the reaction of Duncan is not what you expect (was he into it or not?) - unless you have had anything to do with abandoned youth that are desperately seeking a connection in any form.  Perry is a sad one and yet he reacts to the gentleness and innocence in Duncan as one would expect from a victim of child abuse (who react to positive attention and adoration and recognise those that are not a threat)...he has compassion in the scene with the chicken, returning it to Duncan.  However, WARNING, if you don't like sad endings or disturbing ones DON'T GO BEYOND THE RETURNING OF THE CHICKEN.  It was hinted at in other reviews but I didn't realise that the giving back of the chicken was not the end of it for the chicken.I saw hope of acceptance of self and others in the scene at night in the truck with the kiss.  Watching Perry give the boy what he thought he wanted even though he was angry that he did want to give it to the boy - and the gentleness and courage of the boy to change it into what he actually wanted causing a momentary softening in Perry. The outcome of that brief softening was that of a door slamming on possibilities (and a fist slamming from an abusive father), to be opened near the end (before the  chicken scene) showing Perry could be saved from his wretched spiral given the right stimuli.  There are some issues with the movie but I am not one of those techno-buffs that pick holes in production, or a critic of writing or acting - I just love movies that express love in its various forms.  Do I wish I hadn't bought this?  No.  Am I recommending it?  Yes, however the chicken scene needs to be rated as disturbing - but then I love happy endings and I didn't get one. Well, you do see Duncan and Dad reconnecting so I suppose that is happy.

972619,A3J5UO5QMTFSWB,B000EGEKRO,"Connoisseur Rat ""armchair experientialist""","[15, 17]","In viewing the difficult-to-stomach ""Mudge Boy"", I was reminded of one of acclaimed author Kurt Vonnegut's Rules for Writing Fiction: ""Be a sadist.  No matter how sweet and innocent your leading characters, make awful things happen to them.""  Well, writer/director Michael Burke must have had that rule etched into the arm of his director's chair, since this movie's adorable and engaging main character has a most difficult time of it, to say the least.  (And I'm not even talking about the Duncan Mudge character, by the way - I'm talking about the chicken!)But the guileless and grief-stricken Duncan doesn't have it too easy either; struggling with the recent loss of his mother in a rugged and rural environment that seemingly has no place for him, and a reticent father who just wishes the boy would ""grieve like a normal person"" (i.e. start bonding more with the local kids instead of with mom's pet chickens, and stay out of her fur coats and wedding dresses while you're at it, Dunc).""People do weird stuff sometimes,"" says Duncan to his only friend (and possible love interest) Perry, and this line could work very well as a thesis statement for many of its characters actions.  'Cause even though Duncan (played with striking bravery and purity by Emile Hirsh) is known as the local weirdo, the randy farmhand Perry (played with much swagger and bravado by Tommy Guiry, who up till this film had taken more docile and sensitive roles, so really is impressive with the level of latent menace he brings to the role) doesn't exactly keep to the straight and narrow himself.Early on in the film, in providing two chickens for father Edgar's helper friend, Duncan says to him (about the chickens): ""These are good layers.""  Which also struck me as being a good comment about the film itself, since this mood piece of pain and redemption is all about layers - and not only the chicken kind.There are the competing layers of guilt and lust in the lonely rural young men who are so desperate to connect that they flirt dangerously with the lines of taboo within their machismo posturing (or expectations thereof).  There are the layers of love and scorn in the brilliant Richard Jenkins as Edgar, not approving of his sons choices but not withholding love just because he holds back his approval.  There are the layers of connection and betrayal, especially in the brutal and infamous Mudge packing scene, where Perry defiles both Duncan's sacred place and his physical space as well.Then there are the visual layers, the spectacular cinematography with its carefully composed shots consisting of frames within frames - shots through doors and windows, and wide, layered shots with natural motion, all nestled comfortably beneath a plaintive and spare mostly-acoustic soundtrack.There is almost a pugilistic poignancy to the ""Mudge Boy"" - a poetry without words that hits you hard in the heart and in the gut.  And even though there's so much malice in the film, there is at least the attempt at a tender - if not completely happy - ending.  But, for this viewer, that attempted uplift came just a little too late (and after a few too many shocking moments) to be truly soothing - it's kind of like a band-aid applied to a gushing wound.Still, there is at least some degree of catharsis and understanding amidst the bloodletting.  In the director's commentary track, he spells out what the game plan was for himself and his DP: ""Let's be bold in our choices.  Let's just go for it.  Let's not go halfway.  Let's make strong decisions and take risks and stand behind them.""  And to that I feel they succeeded and remained very true to their vision.  And in ""The Mudge Boy,"" we get an uncomfortable up close look at how American rural men sometimes have to subvert their sensitive side in order to thrive, and how those who cannot manage this subversion must somehow struggle to survive.Not recommended for those who like feelgood films, lots of plot, and snappy dialog.  Highly recommended to those who enjoy long, visually meditational and lyrical scenes of life at its most harrowing, where freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose.",4,I Know This Mudge Is True,1175904000,"04 7, 2007",2007,4148,"['viewing', 'difficult-to-stomach', 'Mudge', 'Boy', 'was', 'reminded', 'one', 'acclaimed', 'author', 'Kurt', 'Vonnegut', 'Rules', 'Writing', 'Fiction', 'Be', 'sadist', 'matter', 'how', 'sweet', 'innocent', 'leading', 'characters', 'make', 'awful', 'things', 'happen', 'Well', 'writer/director', 'Michael', 'Burke', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'rule', 'etched', 'arm', 'director', 'chair', 'movie', 'adorable', 'engaging', 'main', 'character', 'most', 'difficult', 'time', 'say', 'least', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'talking', 'Duncan', 'Mudge', 'character', 'way', ""'m"", 'talking', 'chicken', 'guileless', 'grief-stricken', 'Duncan', ""n't"", 'have', 'too', 'easy', 'struggling', 'recent', 'loss', 'mother', 'rugged', 'rural', 'environment', 'seemingly', 'place', 'reticent', 'father', 'who', 'just', 'boy', 'would', 'grieve', 'normal', 'person', 'i.e', 'start', 'bonding', 'more', 'local', 'kids', 'instead', 'mom', 'pet', 'chickens', 'stay', 'fur', 'coats', 'wedding', 'dresses', ""'re"", 'Dunc', 'People', 'do', 'weird', 'stuff', 'sometimes', 'Duncan', 'only', 'friend', 'possible', 'love', 'interest', 'Perry', 'line', 'could', 'work', 'very', 'well', 'thesis', 'statement', 'many', 'characters', 'actions', ""'Cause"", 'even', 'Duncan', 'played', 'striking', 'bravery', 'purity', 'Emile', 'Hirsh', 'known', 'local', 'weirdo', 'randy', 'farmhand', 'Perry', 'played', 'much', 'swagger', 'bravado', 'Tommy', 'Guiry', 'who', 'up', 'till', 'film', 'had', 'taken', 'more', 'docile', 'sensitive', 'roles', 'so', 'really', 'impressive', 'level', 'latent', 'menace', 'role', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'keep', 'straight', 'narrow', 'himself.Early', 'film', 'providing', 'two', 'chickens', 'father', 'Edgar', 'helper', 'friend', 'Duncan', 'chickens', 'are', 'good', 'layers', 'Which', 'also', 'struck', 'being', 'good', 'comment', 'film', 'mood', 'piece', 'pain', 'redemption', 'layers', 'not', 'only', 'chicken', 'are', 'competing', 'layers', 'guilt', 'lust', 'lonely', 'rural', 'young', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'so', 'desperate', 'connect', 'flirt', 'dangerously', 'lines', 'taboo', 'machismo', 'posturing', 'expectations', 'thereof', 'are', 'layers', 'love', 'scorn', 'brilliant', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'Edgar', 'not', 'approving', 'sons', 'choices', 'not', 'withholding', 'love', 'just', 'back', 'approval', 'are', 'layers', 'connection', 'betrayal', 'especially', 'brutal', 'infamous', 'Mudge', 'packing', 'scene', 'where', 'Perry', 'Duncan', 'sacred', 'place', 'physical', 'space', 'well.Then', 'are', 'visual', 'layers', 'spectacular', 'cinematography', 'carefully', 'composed', 'shots', 'consisting', 'frames', 'frames', 'shots', 'doors', 'windows', 'wide', 'layered', 'shots', 'natural', 'motion', 'nestled', 'comfortably', 'plaintive', 'spare', 'mostly-acoustic', 'soundtrack.There', 'almost', 'pugilistic', 'poignancy', 'Mudge', 'Boy', 'poetry', 'words', 'hard', 'heart', 'gut', 'even', 'so', 'much', 'malice', 'film', 'least', 'attempt', 'tender', 'not', 'completely', 'happy', 'ending', 'viewer', 'attempted', 'uplift', 'came', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'late', 'few', 'too', 'many', 'shocking', 'moments', 'be', 'truly', 'soothing', 'kind', 'band-aid', 'applied', 'gushing', 'wound.Still', 'least', 'degree', 'catharsis', 'understanding', 'amidst', 'bloodletting', 'director', 'commentary', 'track', 'out', 'what', 'game', 'plan', 'was', 'DP', 'Let', 'be', 'bold', 'choices', 'Let', 'just', 'go', 'Let', 'not', 'go', 'halfway', 'Let', 'make', 'strong', 'decisions', 'take', 'risks', 'stand', 'feel', 'succeeded', 'remained', 'very', 'true', 'vision', 'Mudge', 'Boy', 'get', 'uncomfortable', 'up', 'close', 'look', 'how', 'American', 'rural', 'men', 'sometimes', 'have', 'subvert', 'sensitive', 'side', 'order', 'thrive', 'how', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'manage', 'subversion', 'must', 'somehow', 'struggle', 'survive.Not', 'recommended', 'who', 'like', 'feelgood', 'films', 'lots', 'plot', 'snappy', 'dialog', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'who', 'enjoy', 'long', 'visually', 'meditational', 'lyrical', 'scenes', 'life', 'most', 'harrowing', 'where', 'freedom', 'just', 'word', 'nothin', 'left', 'lose']",The Mudge Boy

972625,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000EGEKRO,Grady Harp,"[123, 128]","Michael Burke both wrote and directed this first class, finely wrought exploration of coming of age in the emotional battlefield of rural bigotry. Rarely has so much been said so successfully with so little dialogue. Burke is clearly a gifted filmmaker about whom we should be hearing much! The film opens with what appears to be an idyllic country road over which a person on an old bicycle is delivering eggs. As the credits are ending we see the person on the bicycle walk up a steep incline then fall to the ground. As the actual film opens we discover that this person was the mother of Duncan (Emile Hirsch in a career making performance), a fourteen year old young lad who is left mourning with his distant father Edgar (Richard Jenkins). Unable to wholly cope with the loss of his mother, Duncan holds closely to her remnants - a chicken as a pet who his mother taught him could be calmed by putting the chicken's head in Duncan's mouth, an old fake fur coat he wears to bed, and some kitchen skills he learned at her side. Edgar is resentful that Duncan isn't more helpful on their small farm and is shaken by observing Duncan's means of mourning his mother.Duncan is a loner, hungry for relating, and encounters neighboring Perry (Tom Guiry, in another gripping performance), a seemingly macho kid who apparently is beaten (if not more) by his low-class father. The two bond, slowly, out of mutual needs. Perry defends Duncan's ridiculing by the local rowdy kids and even encourages Duncan to join the drinking bouts with the group. Yet Duncan remains an outsider, longing to be included, and when certain events occur with Perry (Perry urges Duncan to put on his mother's wedding dress in the secrecy of the barn and then progresses to having Duncan perform sexual acts with him, declaring all the while that he, Perry, is not gay...) only to have the incident be partially discovered by Duncan's father. At odds with what to do with his strange acting son, Edgar forces Duncan to work at meaningless jobs on the farm, help with the haying, and makes Duncan observe the burning of the mother's clothes and belongings.Duncan seeks Perry's consolation after the above events and despite Perry's homophobic comments, Duncan manages to gain the kiss from Perry that he so desires as a resurrection of affection desperately missing in his life. Perry is further abused by his own father and participates to a degree in an incident of harassment by the local rowdies of Duncan and his pet chicken. It is the method in which this final confrontation ends that speaks so strongly about Duncan's needs and Perry's buried feelings. After the confrontation Duncan rides his bicycle home to where his father finally perceives the agony chewing Duncan's soul and the movie ends in one of the most life affirming moments ever captured on film.The photography is magnificent, the musical score is spare and enhancing, and the acting on the part of every member of this well directed cast is superb. This is a film that deserves wide audience exposure, and especially for those young people who are struggling with their sexuality in the ugly isolation surrounding the lives of the main characters of this excellent film.

He's socially inept and psychologically troubled, and his best friends are an invisible boy named Edgar and a chicken named Chicken.  In fact, chickens are just about his only real friends.The kid's troubled, and his chicken friendship is not the only problem.  He also enjoys deep-throating chicken heads (not a euphimism) and wearing his deceased mother's clothing.  And when around others his age, he's hopelessly out of place and goofy - basically he's Forrest Gump with a chicken instead of Jenny.One day he's with a classmate named Perry when more is revealed about Duncan.  He stares at his friend's penis, then peaks at it again, while Perry urinates while telling a lurid sexual tale.  That night, Duncan's father catches him wearing his mother's nightgown.  The next day he is huddled next to Perry, both in underwear, and reaches for Perry's bicep.  It's safe to say that his mother's death has brought on the gender confusion and homosexual tendencies.  In fact, I'd say that the underlying message of the movie is that many believe those actitivies and beliefs are more often than not the result of some sort of childhood trauma, and a mental problem.The movie gets weirder by the minute, and it's only a matter of time before there's fellatio, voyuerism, and Duncan gets raped in the barn by Perry while wearing his mother's wedding dress - despite Perry's protestations of not being a ""queer"".  Yeah, you read that right.Don't let anyone convince you otherwise; this movie is disgusting for the sake of shock in order to make a statement of some perverse kind.  It's not about love as some posters have stated or glossed over.  It's violent, abusive, and criminal what happens, and displays more about what can happen to someone facing constant physical and psychological trauma than anything else.

972630,A8QG61LYK0XO1,B000EGEKRO,JUST A REVIEWER2,"[28, 39]",".................is Falling, The Sky is Falling"" (on the Director's head, we can only hope)The synopses ((synopsis?........oasis.....oases.......you say tomato, I say to-mah-to.......you say banana, I say ba-nah-na........oh, never mind, please excuse the foolishness)) of two or three of the reviewers already here are just topnotch.  I can add nothing much to them, but would like to stick in the following few observations for your consideration.Only 3 actors are really deserving of truly big acknowledgement in this film (Hirsch for Duncan, Guiry for Perry and Jenkins for ""Chicken Boy's"" Dad (who IS distant, as described by one reviewer, but certainly not emotionless, as described by another, for he gives us at film's end an unexpected and utterly amazing emotional moment).  Oh, wait, there is also the sweet teen-girl (Handerhan's Tonya) who becomes ""Chicken Boy's"" benefactress/protectress during the film.  Well, gee, stupid me, slow down, almost completely forgot there is, indeed, a fifth notable character:  ""Chicken,"" the little lady who gives her all (and more) to the making of this film.We've been given a couple of very brave young stars (respectively, about 17 and 21 years at time of filming).  Not every rising young actor, particularly one with the level of sensitivity displayed by Hirsch, and also Guiry (under a 'tough guy' veneer), is going to accept a role which requires him to give fellatio, or play the part of the one forcing it.  Even more difficult might be agreeing to play a character who is going to be so obviously ""taking it up the bum"" or, again, play the part of the one forcing it (sorry for the unintended play on words).  To compound the difficulty, not only must a young Hirsch, playing Duncan, face his screen Dad following such behavior, but a young Hirsch playing this scene must also face his real-life Father, who, according to the director's DVD commentary, accompanied Emile on his casting call (and, I would suspect, due to young age, to the shooting as well).  What a great open and understanding relationship we must have between these two, eh?  To close out my thoughts, the following is a must-mention.Beyond stunned(!) has to be this reviewer's reaction to a statement made by the director (dare I even afford him that title----notice the small 'd') in his voice-over commentary as the DVD plays out.  It's in a near-end-of-film scene at which we find our young teens, well after dark, huddled in an old truck cab.  Duncan, in the very depths of his despair, at his very lowest emotional level to this point in the film, has made his way to Perry's house and awakened him in an effort to find even some slight display of comfort and affection.  The scene that plays out is the film's most emotional to that point (the earlier barn rape being the most shocking).  Yet, astoundingly, rather than discuss the emotional difficulties likely faced by both young actors in playing out this difficult scene and how he might have facilitated their doing so, the director, instead, spends the entire time commenting over and over why the scene was (apparently) shot in black and white.  If possible, even more thoughtless are statements he then makes, quoted here pretty much verbatim:  ""What we were going for....to sort of undercut the, uh, you know, uh, mushy love story, you know, part of it, to make a real coolness that, you know, uh, to give the scene this other sort of color.........""Being, I hope, an empathetic viewer, I was just floored.  I can't imagine how hard it must be for an actor to have gone through what Hirsch apparently did to reach the point of shyly and almost inaudibly asking Perry:  ""Did ya ever think about kissing me?""  Then, to later learn, in viewing the DVD, that your director's apparent take on the scene was that it's ""mushy.""  OH, MY!PS--And, no, I haven't ""mis-adjectivized"" the scenes mentioned so far ('most shocking'......'most emotional'). But what, you ask, of that next-to-last-scene between Duncan and his tormentors? Ah, say I, that one is the 'most sad' (for it tells us of our treatment of one another). And about the movie's final scene, you query? Well, the 'most uplifting', of course.PPS--Well, can't stay mad forever. Thank you, Mr. Director, for giving us a very well written and well-brought-to-the-screen production.****",5,"QUOTH Chicken Mudge:  ""The Sky...................",1153699200,"07 24, 2006",2006,4327,"['..is', 'Falling', 'Sky', 'Falling', 'Director', 'head', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'synopses', 'synopsis', '..oasis', '..oases', '.you', 'say', 'tomato', 'say', 'to-mah-to', '.you', 'say', 'banana', 'say', 'ba-nah-na', '..oh', 'never', 'mind', 'please', 'foolishness', 'two', 'three', 'reviewers', 'already', 'here', 'are', 'just', 'topnotch', 'can', 'add', 'nothing', 'much', 'would', 'like', 'stick', 'following', 'few', 'observations', 'consideration.Only', '3', 'actors', 'are', 'really', 'deserving', 'truly', 'big', 'acknowledgement', 'film', 'Hirsch', 'Duncan', 'Guiry', 'Perry', 'Jenkins', 'Chicken', 'Boy', 'Dad', 'who', 'distant', 'described', 'one', 'reviewer', 'certainly', 'not', 'emotionless', 'described', 'film', 'end', 'unexpected', 'utterly', 'amazing', 'emotional', 'moment', 'Oh', 'wait', 'also', 'sweet', 'teen-girl', 'Handerhan', 'Tonya', 'who', 'Chicken', 'Boy', 'benefactress/protectress', 'film', 'Well', 'gee', 'stupid', 'slow', 'down', 'almost', 'completely', 'forgot', 'indeed', 'fifth', 'notable', 'character', 'Chicken', 'little', 'lady', 'who', 'more', 'making', 'film.We', ""'ve"", 'been', 'given', 'couple', 'very', 'brave', 'young', 'stars', 'respectively', '17', '21', 'years', 'time', 'filming', 'Not', 'rising', 'young', 'actor', 'particularly', 'one', 'level', 'sensitivity', 'displayed', 'Hirsch', 'also', 'Guiry', ""'tough"", 'guy', 'veneer', 'going', 'accept', 'role', 'give', 'fellatio', 'play', 'part', 'one', 'forcing', 'Even', 'more', 'difficult', 'might', 'be', 'agreeing', 'play', 'character', 'who', 'going', 'be', 'so', 'obviously', 'taking', 'bum', 'again', 'play', 'part', 'one', 'forcing', 'sorry', 'unintended', 'play', 'words', 'compound', 'difficulty', 'not', 'only', 'must', 'young', 'Hirsch', 'playing', 'Duncan', 'face', 'screen', 'Dad', 'following', 'such', 'behavior', 'young', 'Hirsch', 'playing', 'scene', 'must', 'also', 'face', 'real-life', 'Father', 'who', 'according', 'director', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'accompanied', 'Emile', 'casting', 'call', 'would', 'suspect', 'due', 'young', 'age', 'shooting', 'as', 'well', 'What', 'great', 'open', 'understanding', 'relationship', 'must', 'have', 'two', 'eh', 'close', 'out', 'thoughts', 'following', 'must-mention.Beyond', 'stunned', 'be', 'reviewer', 'reaction', 'statement', 'made', 'director', 'dare', 'even', 'afford', 'title', 'small', ""'d"", 'voice-over', 'commentary', 'DVD', 'out', 'near-end-of-film', 'scene', 'find', 'young', 'teens', 'well', 'dark', 'huddled', 'old', 'truck', 'cab', 'Duncan', 'very', 'depths', 'despair', 'very', 'lowest', 'emotional', 'level', 'point', 'film', 'made', 'way', 'Perry', 'house', 'awakened', 'effort', 'find', 'even', 'slight', 'display', 'comfort', 'affection', 'scene', 'out', 'film', 'most', 'emotional', 'point', 'earlier', 'barn', 'rape', 'being', 'most', 'shocking', 'astoundingly', 'rather', 'discuss', 'emotional', 'difficulties', 'likely', 'faced', 'young', 'actors', 'playing', 'out', 'difficult', 'scene', 'how', 'might', 'have', 'facilitated', 'doing', 'so', 'director', 'instead', 'entire', 'time', 'commenting', 'why', 'scene', 'was', 'apparently', 'shot', 'black', 'white', 'possible', 'even', 'more', 'thoughtless', 'are', 'statements', 'then', 'quoted', 'here', 'pretty', 'much', 'verbatim', 'What', 'were', 'going', '.to', 'sort', 'undercut', 'uh', 'know', 'uh', 'mushy', 'love', 'story', 'know', 'part', 'make', 'real', 'coolness', 'know', 'uh', 'give', 'scene', 'other', 'sort', 'color', 'Being', 'hope', 'empathetic', 'viewer', 'was', 'just', 'floored', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'how', 'hard', 'must', 'be', 'actor', 'have', 'gone', 'what', 'Hirsch', 'apparently', 'did', 'reach', 'point', 'shyly', 'almost', 'inaudibly', 'asking', 'Perry', 'Did', 'ya', 'ever', 'think', 'kissing', 'Then', 'later', 'learn', 'viewing', 'DVD', 'director', 'apparent', 'take', 'scene', 'was', 'mushy', 'OH', 'MY', 'PS', 'have', ""n't"", 'mis-adjectivized', 'scenes', 'mentioned', 'so', 'far', ""'most"", 'shocking', 'emotional', 'what', 'ask', 'next-to-last-scene', 'Duncan', 'tormentors', 'Ah', 'say', 'one', ""'most"", 'sad', 'treatment', 'one', 'movie', 'final', 'scene', 'query', 'Well', ""'most"", 'uplifting', 'course.PPS', 'Well', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stay', 'mad', 'forever', 'Thank', 'Mr.', 'Director', 'giving', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'well-brought-to-the-screen', 'production', '****']",The Mudge Boy

It is a full-length feature expanded from the bucolic short film, 'Fishbelly White', but which contains none of its lyricism and rural poetry.Duncan is a 14-year-old misfit known for the chickens that he cares for like pets.  He is isolated and lonely because his mother has just died, and his mono-syllabic father ignores him.  And, in keeping with a time-honored cinematic cliche (starting with `Tea and Sympathy'), he is teased, tortured, and threatened by his macho peers for being 'different'.  It seems that he may have a friend in leader-of-the-pack Perry but this is where the two versions part company.  In the short, they develop a lovely, understated homoerotic romance.  Here, Perry is violent and brutal, like his abusive father, ultimately instigating Duncan's final humiliation.There is not one moment of tenderness in the entire film until the final 'reconciliation' between Duncan and his father but, considering the unrelenting nastiness which has come before, it feels highly contrived.  Duncan is such a willing, unquestioning `victim' throughout the film, any resolution-of-conflict which might have raised this to a true coming-of-age story is lost.This is a surprising entry from the usually gay-friendly Showtime Network.

972634,A20NJAPECFGIR9,B000EGEKRO,"nina ""Movie Maiden""","[0, 0]","Duncan's behavior was the most compelling part of this film. It's what drives you to keep watching. I kept waiting for the film to further explore why he was the way he was. I don't believe he changed only when his mother died. From the disturbing way Duncan acted it was apparent that he had issues other than his mother's passing. The passing just brought it out.Duncan is the perfect candidate to grow up a serial killer. He stays isolated, he's tormented by the local ""cool kids"" and abused emotionally and a little physically by his dad.He is the perfect villain, if the story had carried it that way. Duncan makes you feel sorry for him but also frightened because he's like a ticking time bomb that's about to pop any second. You just hold your breath wondering when.By the end of the film I assumed Duncan would shoot everyone in the county. I enjoyed this character very much.I also enjoyed his friendship/relationship with Perry. But Perry's motives aren't clear. It's hard to tell if Perry is really gay or just after sex with Duncan to see what sex with a boy is like. Perry is such a sexual person that he almost seems addicted to it. If he's not having sex, he's talking about it and in such crude detail. It's obvious his mission in life is to be turned on and turn others on, but why? His attraction to Duncan plays more like a fantasy he has than sincere.We know Perry is being abused but what was under the surface? I wished the film had focused more on why Perry and Duncan really did what they did instead of gloss over their actions. I also think the homosexual spin took too long to display. Perry and Duncan spend the movie hanging with each other but it wasn't until almost the end of the movie that they take their relationship to another level.Which was also very disturbing. Perry ends up raping Duncan (after tricking Duncan into putting on a wedding dress) and the movie is done to where even though Duncan knows what happened, he accepts it and even likes it. Another disturbing action that we don't get any explanation for. Instead of Duncan being upset or confused about what Perry did, he encourages more attention.The characters could've benefited from better direction. I liked both Duncan and Perry very much and would've rather the bulk of the film just been about these two. But we get a lot of boring scenes in between and a lot of things that just aren't explained.With more attention to detail and better writing, this movie could've been five star material.",2,Should've Focused More on Duncan's Behavior,1339891200,"06 17, 2012",2012,2499,"['Duncan', 'behavior', 'was', 'most', 'compelling', 'part', 'film', 'what', 'keep', 'watching', 'kept', 'waiting', 'film', 'further', 'explore', 'why', 'was', 'way', 'was', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'changed', 'only', 'when', 'mother', 'died', 'disturbing', 'way', 'Duncan', 'acted', 'was', 'apparent', 'had', 'issues', 'other', 'mother', 'passing', 'passing', 'just', 'brought', 'perfect', 'candidate', 'grow', 'up', 'serial', 'killer', 'isolated', 'tormented', 'local', 'cool', 'kids', 'abused', 'emotionally', 'little', 'physically', 'dad.He', 'perfect', 'villain', 'story', 'had', 'carried', 'way', 'Duncan', 'feel', 'sorry', 'also', 'frightened', 'ticking', 'time', 'bomb', 'pop', 'second', 'just', 'hold', 'breath', 'wondering', 'when.By', 'end', 'film', 'assumed', 'Duncan', 'would', 'shoot', 'everyone', 'county', 'enjoyed', 'character', 'very', 'much.I', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'friendship/relationship', 'Perry', 'Perry', 'motives', 'are', ""n't"", 'clear', 'hard', 'tell', 'Perry', 'really', 'gay', 'just', 'sex', 'Duncan', 'see', 'what', 'sex', 'boy', 'Perry', 'such', 'sexual', 'person', 'almost', 'addicted', 'not', 'having', 'sex', 'talking', 'such', 'crude', 'detail', 'obvious', 'mission', 'life', 'be', 'turned', 'turn', 'others', 'why', 'attraction', 'Duncan', 'more', 'fantasy', 'sincere.We', 'know', 'Perry', 'being', 'abused', 'what', 'was', 'surface', 'wished', 'film', 'had', 'focused', 'more', 'why', 'Perry', 'Duncan', 'really', 'did', 'what', 'did', 'instead', 'gloss', 'actions', 'also', 'think', 'homosexual', 'spin', 'took', 'too', 'long', 'display', 'Perry', 'Duncan', 'spend', 'movie', 'hanging', 'other', 'was', ""n't"", 'almost', 'end', 'movie', 'take', 'relationship', 'level.Which', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'disturbing', 'Perry', 'up', 'raping', 'Duncan', 'tricking', 'Duncan', 'putting', 'wedding', 'dress', 'movie', 'done', 'where', 'even', 'Duncan', 'what', 'happened', 'even', 'disturbing', 'action', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'explanation', 'Instead', 'Duncan', 'being', 'upset', 'confused', 'what', 'Perry', 'did', 'more', 'attention.The', 'characters', 'could', ""'ve"", 'benefited', 'better', 'direction', 'liked', 'Duncan', 'Perry', 'very', 'much', 'would', ""'ve"", 'rather', 'bulk', 'film', 'just', 'been', 'two', 'get', 'lot', 'boring', 'scenes', 'lot', 'things', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'explained.With', 'more', 'attention', 'detail', 'better', 'writing', 'movie', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'five', 'star', 'material']",The Mudge Boy
