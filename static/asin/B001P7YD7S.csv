1225970,A1ALOIPRR8Q06J,B001P7YD7S,"2 cents ""meaningless memes""","[36, 37]","Hands down the best show featuring land dwelling cephalopods ever made. One thing the show has going for it is a total disregard for continuity. It's fun seeing characters mutilated or killed repeatedly. Also, it is a show about hillbilly squids. They live in Northern Georgia and are protected by the Endangered Species Act so they're free to raise hell. In addition to the squids other regular characters include a Sheriff and an evil capitalist named Dan Halen that looks like a....I don't know. He has no knees and looks like half a ball sac. He talks like Orson Welles and is immortal and then there is Krystal. And well, come to think of it, you got a bunch of great characters including the Reverend (another bizarre creation) and the Devil and Jesus too --both as you've never seen them before. Anyway, I've seen hillbilly shows and hillbillies in person and the same with squids and putting the two together to make one creature makes perfect sense. The animation is superb. Crude and decadent as it should be. One aspect of the show that I love is the narration featured on some episodes. Cracks me up like an Easter egg. Just the tone of it. The second volume is even better than the first one. Do it to it.6 Stars.",5,quality entertainment,1240358400,"04 22, 2009",2009,1226,"['Hands', 'down', 'best', 'show', 'featuring', 'land', 'dwelling', 'cephalopods', 'ever', 'made', 'One', 'thing', 'show', 'going', 'total', 'disregard', 'continuity', 'fun', 'seeing', 'characters', 'mutilated', 'killed', 'repeatedly', 'Also', 'show', 'hillbilly', 'squids', 'live', 'Northern', 'Georgia', 'are', 'protected', 'Endangered', 'Species', 'Act', ""'re"", 'free', 'raise', 'hell', 'addition', 'squids', 'other', 'regular', 'characters', 'include', 'Sheriff', 'evil', 'capitalist', 'named', 'Dan', 'Halen', '.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'knees', 'ball', 'sac', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'immortal', 'then', 'Krystal', 'well', 'come', 'think', 'got', 'bunch', 'great', 'characters', 'including', 'Reverend', 'bizarre', 'creation', 'Devil', 'Jesus', 'too', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'before', 'Anyway', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'hillbilly', 'shows', 'hillbillies', 'person', 'same', 'squids', 'putting', 'two', 'together', 'make', 'one', 'creature', 'perfect', 'sense', 'animation', 'superb', 'Crude', 'decadent', 'should', 'be', 'One', 'aspect', 'show', 'love', 'narration', 'featured', 'episodes', 'Cracks', 'up', 'Easter', 'egg', 'Just', 'tone', 'second', 'volume', 'even', 'better', 'first', 'one', 'Do', 'it.6', 'Stars']",Squidbillies: Volume Two
1225971,AQUVTQFFXP4AC,B001P7YD7S,"Andariel Halo ""Disillusioned Smark""","[2, 2]","Somehow the novelty of the fact that the Cuyler family is one of the rare, endangered ""North Georgia Mountain Squid"" never ceases to be hilarious as they do stuff, usually involving lots of mayhem and insanity and drunkenness.Unknown Hinson's voice is a goldmine that makes any and all lines spoken by Early into hilarity waiting to happen, or not. The accents, the butchered english, the jokes, the sounds, all the sort of things, all done to a poorly animated, poorly drawn visuals that nevertheless are fun to watch because of their grit and filthiness.Unfortunately for the show, it's one of those ""Adult Swim"" originals that typically will have a fanbase only as large as a hatebase. As many people would/will hate the show as much as people would love it.Surprisingly, the creators, in one of the DVD bonus documentaries, take the show idea quite seriously, and detail stories of how hundreds of people put together crappy auditions for the roles, and how they did not want to ""mock"" Southern people or accents, but wanted genuine Southerners in the roles so as to make it sound more natural.Ultimately, though, the show is about crazed dialogue, overt offensive humor, and seemingly ""random"" things (such as aliens who befriend the Cuyler, and shout ""Death to America!"" at random moments, which no one seems to notice).This is a show that is immensely quotable.  And inspired me to want a Truck-boat-truck when I grow up.",5,It's made more hilarious by the fact that they are squids,1246406400,"07 1, 2009",2009,1428,"['Somehow', 'novelty', 'fact', 'Cuyler', 'family', 'one', 'rare', 'endangered', 'North', 'Georgia', 'Mountain', 'Squid', 'never', 'be', 'hilarious', 'do', 'stuff', 'usually', 'involving', 'lots', 'mayhem', 'insanity', 'drunkenness.Unknown', 'Hinson', 'voice', 'goldmine', 'lines', 'spoken', 'Early', 'hilarity', 'waiting', 'happen', 'not', 'accents', 'butchered', 'english', 'jokes', 'sounds', 'sort', 'things', 'done', 'poorly', 'animated', 'poorly', 'drawn', 'visuals', 'nevertheless', 'are', 'fun', 'watch', 'grit', 'filthiness.Unfortunately', 'show', 'one', 'Adult', 'Swim', 'originals', 'typically', 'will', 'have', 'fanbase', 'only', 'as', 'large', 'hatebase', 'many', 'people', 'would/will', 'hate', 'show', 'as', 'much', 'people', 'would', 'love', 'it.Surprisingly', 'creators', 'one', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'documentaries', 'take', 'show', 'idea', 'quite', 'seriously', 'detail', 'stories', 'how', 'hundreds', 'people', 'put', 'together', 'crappy', 'auditions', 'roles', 'how', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'mock', 'Southern', 'people', 'accents', 'wanted', 'genuine', 'Southerners', 'roles', 'so', 'make', 'sound', 'more', 'natural.Ultimately', 'show', 'crazed', 'dialogue', 'overt', 'offensive', 'humor', 'seemingly', 'random', 'things', 'such', 'aliens', 'who', 'befriend', 'Cuyler', 'Death', 'America', 'random', 'moments', 'one', 'notice', '.This', 'show', 'immensely', 'quotable', 'inspired', 'want', 'Truck-boat-truck', 'when', 'grow', 'up']",Squidbillies: Volume Two
