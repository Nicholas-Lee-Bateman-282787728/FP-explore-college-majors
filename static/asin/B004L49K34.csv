The overall quality of the dubbing is quite good especially for Asuta and Ayuki, ironically the two least main of the main characters. Some such as Tomari are not bad but it will take me some time to get used to their new voices. Overall I feel this is worth it for all because even if you don't like the dubbing you always have the option to watch it in Japanese and I am a big fan of options.",4,"Not Bad, Not Bad at All",1348012800,"09 19, 2012",2012,559,"['have', 'been', 'watching', 'anime', 'Japanese', 'English', 'subtitles', 'reading', 'manga', 'while', 'nice', 'see', 'finally', 'gotten', 'English', 'dub', 'overall', 'quality', 'dubbing', 'quite', 'good', 'especially', 'Asuta', 'Ayuki', 'ironically', 'two', 'least', 'main', 'main', 'characters', 'such', 'Tomari', 'are', 'not', 'bad', 'will', 'take', 'time', 'get', 'used', 'new', 'voices', 'Overall', 'feel', 'worth', 'because', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'dubbing', 'always', 'have', 'option', 'watch', 'Japanese', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'options']",N/A
1412925,AOB5695UUUJ0,B004L49K34,"Anime Lover ""D""","[2, 2]","Okay, this is a story that caught my eye from the moment I read the synopsis.  A sensitive young man who, while being egged on by his childhood friend who is hiding her own feelings for him, was crushed by the girl of his dreams, only to get a spaceship right between the eyes and turned into a girl. As s/he starts her new life as a girl, Hazumo learns that being a girl is not as easy as it appears.  New clothes, new behaviors, and of course using the girls restroom is only the beginning.  Her parents are space cases, her best male friend is having a hard time taking her seriously, and not to mention that the alien who ran her over is now living with her, works in her school so he can observe our society, and his ship looks like her and calls her sister-brother.  But then when the girl she liked as a boy actually likes her as a girl, and her childhood friend is fighting the fact she liked him as a boy and can not get over the fact he is a she, someone's heart might get broken.The story gives the romantic person a good run, while still giving good laughs. the story is well written, the actors were well chosen, and the dub is right on (and you can hear it in japanese with titles if yu want to hear the orignial soundtrack).  give this one a watch, it is worth it.",5,"A beautiful story, but a good laugh",1304985600,"05 10, 2011",2011,1279,"['Okay', 'story', 'caught', 'eye', 'moment', 'read', 'synopsis', 'sensitive', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'being', 'egged', 'childhood', 'friend', 'who', 'hiding', 'own', 'feelings', 'was', 'crushed', 'girl', 'dreams', 'only', 'get', 'spaceship', 'right', 'eyes', 'turned', 'girl', 's/he', 'new', 'life', 'girl', 'Hazumo', 'being', 'girl', 'not', 'as', 'easy', 'New', 'clothes', 'new', 'behaviors', 'course', 'using', 'girls', 'restroom', 'only', 'beginning', 'parents', 'are', 'space', 'cases', 'best', 'male', 'friend', 'having', 'hard', 'time', 'taking', 'seriously', 'not', 'mention', 'alien', 'who', 'ran', 'over', 'now', 'living', 'school', 'can', 'observe', 'society', 'ship', 'sister-brother', 'then', 'when', 'girl', 'liked', 'boy', 'actually', 'girl', 'childhood', 'friend', 'fighting', 'fact', 'liked', 'boy', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'fact', 'someone', 'heart', 'might', 'get', 'broken.The', 'story', 'romantic', 'person', 'good', 'run', 'still', 'giving', 'good', 'laughs', 'story', 'well', 'written', 'actors', 'were', 'well', 'chosen', 'dub', 'right', 'can', 'hear', 'japanese', 'titles', 'yu', 'want', 'hear', 'orignial', 'soundtrack', 'give', 'one', 'watch']",N/A

One day he is nearly killed when an alien space craft lands on Earth. The aliens attempt to reconstruct his body, but they accidentally make him a girl instead. Now Hazumu has the attentions of the girl he always liked when she was a boy. Hazumu's best friend even starts being attracted to her. This is where the love triangle begins. Hazumu, his childhood female friend Tomari, and Yasuna, the girl she has had a crush on, are caught in a strange love triangle. The trio's friendship will be tested to the breaking point and new feelings will be discovered. In the end, can all of them be happy?This show has a strange premise, but it's executed very well. All the characters are lovable, fun, and engrossing. The series is animated well and has a good soundtrack. My only real complaint is the English dub. Some of the characters voices aren't bad, but some are terrible. The voice actor for Tomari especially. It's the same voice actor that did Kota in Kanokon.One of the worst English dub actors I've ever heard. Other than that, this series is captivating. After it gets going, the characters grow on you. It's one of those that you like more after every episode. While it starts off kinda above average, it finishes strong and emotional.I really enjoyed this anime. It has comedy, drama, and romance. That's about all you could hope for with a series like this. I recommend it to viewers 13 and up. There is a bit of language, fan service and some perverted stuff, especially from Hazumu's Dad. Overall, it's a lot of fun. It's one that you can watch over again and not get bored with it.

1412927,A2F6UZ8BMH45GX,B004L49K34,peter krug,"[2, 2]","Hazumu was an ordinary (if somewhat effeminite) high school boy who one day worked up the courage to ask out Yasuna, the most beautiful girl at his school, only for her to turn him down. Depressed, Hazumu wandered off to the hills just outside town...and then an alien spaceship came crashing down right on him! The aliens worked quickly to repair his body and save him from death, but they made one big blunder: they turned Hazumu into a girl! Now Hazumu must learn to live his life as the fairer sex. Thankfully for him that's not too difficult, since his personality was pretty feminine to begin with. Yasuna actually finds herself more attracted to Hazumu now that he's a she. But things get complicated when Hazumu's childhood gal pal, the tomboyish Tomari, finds herself falling for Hazumu as well. And then there's the matter of two of the aliens who've decided to stay in town awhile...Lately alot of shows that were originally released Japanese-language only are getting re-released on bilingual format. (Such as BLUE DROP and CLANNAD.) I think it's really wonderful, since now both types of anime fans (purists and dub lovers) can watch the show however they want.There are voice actor interviews, however they are all with the Japanese voice actors, none of the Americans are interviewed.

1412928,AYX5FCONESYBQ,B004L49K34,Rick Dooley Sr.,"[0, 2]","I had been waiting for a dubbed version to come out for a while , so I picked this up and was pretty disappointed . The voice actors I felt were pretty lousy and I ended up watching it subbed . The ending was pretty weak and some of the character developement went backwards , where at the end of the show I liked them less than at the start .I really had high hopes for this one after reading the manga , which had won awards and was highly recommended by reviewers . If you're interested in Kashimashi , then trust me when I tell you , buy the manga . You'll end up with a story with great characters and tons of heart , lots of depth , laughs and some real tugs on your heart strings ( I actually shed a few tears , it touched me so much) .They could have made a show that could have rivalled Air and Clannad instead of tearing the heart of the story and pushing this hollowed out version onto us. So pass on this dvd and use your money to buy the Kashimashi omnibus vol 1+2 for not much more money and you'll thank me . Just make sure you keep some tissues nearby , it can get pretty heart wrenching .",3,Could have been great .,1305590400,"05 17, 2011",2011,1105,"['had', 'been', 'waiting', 'dubbed', 'version', 'come', 'out', 'while', 'picked', 'up', 'was', 'pretty', 'disappointed', 'voice', 'actors', 'felt', 'were', 'pretty', 'lousy', 'ended', 'up', 'watching', 'subbed', 'ending', 'was', 'pretty', 'weak', 'character', 'developement', 'went', 'backwards', 'where', 'end', 'show', 'liked', 'less', 'start', '.I', 'really', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'one', 'reading', 'manga', 'had', 'won', 'awards', 'was', 'highly', 'recommended', 'reviewers', ""'re"", 'interested', 'Kashimashi', 'then', 'trust', 'when', 'tell', 'buy', 'manga', ""'ll"", 'end', 'up', 'story', 'great', 'characters', 'tons', 'heart', 'lots', 'depth', 'real', 'tugs', 'heart', 'strings', 'actually', 'shed', 'few', 'tears', 'touched', 'so', 'much', '.They', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'show', 'could', 'have', 'rivalled', 'Air', 'Clannad', 'instead', 'tearing', 'heart', 'story', 'pushing', 'hollowed', 'version', 'So', 'pass', 'dvd', 'use', 'money', 'buy', 'Kashimashi', 'omnibus', '1+2', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'money', ""'ll"", 'thank', 'Just', 'make', 'sure', 'keep', 'tissues', 'nearby', 'can', 'get', 'pretty', 'heart', 'wrenching']",N/A
