726306,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B00007AJHS,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[17, 17]","The four videos in this set provide a nice variety of yoga practices which are applicable to a wide range of yoga practitioners, from experienced beginners to more advanced yoga students.  The videos are led by Rainbeau Mars, who offers voiceover instruction in a calm soothing voice.  Her mirrored cueing is excellent (although sometimes slightly out-of-sync with her movements on screen), and she is obviously very knowledgeable about yogic principles and traditions as well as anatomical issues.  In addition, the videos are filmed in Hawaii against beautiful backdrops.The most basic practice in this series is Pure Tranquility, which is designed to prepare the body and mind for meditation.  The entire practice is performed in a seated position, and Rainbeau guides you through gentle stretches to open the body and relax the muscles.  The Beginners video actually offers a bit of a challenge and requires some pre-existing strength.  In this practice, Rainbeau begins slowly with breathing exercises and warm-up stretches.  She continues with several vinyasa flow series, still moving slowly but holding some poses (such as downward dog) for an extended period of time.The remaining two videos in this set are significantly more challenging than the first two.  In Pure Power, Rainbeau builds on a series of sun salutations by adding rigorous poses such as side plank,  crescent lunges, chair, and 3-legged down dog.  Pure Sweat further picks up the pace by adding additional lunges and twists as well as plenty of yogi push-ups (chatturangas).  Although these two practices are definitely at an intermediate/advanced level, Rainbeau performs them at a leisurely pace and does not include inversions, thus making the practices extremely accessible.One of the things I like best about this series is that each video is only 30 minutes long, which is especially rare for intermediate/advanced practices.  However, the videos could be easily combined to form an hour long workout if desired:  Beginners would make a perfect warm-up for Pure Sweat, and Pure Tranquility would work well for winding down after Pure Power.As an intermediate yogi who has been practicing yoga for several years now, I would not recommend this set for those totally new to yoga:  while Rainbeau's cueing is excellent, her instruction is not overly detailed, and she does not offer modifications for the poses.  However, beginners who have had some prior experience with yoga can start with the first two videos and build up to the remaining two over time.  Finally, this series is not for someone who is looking for a fast-paced, power yoga or ashtanga-type practice, as everything about Rainbeau is laid back and relaxed.  Rather, this set is perfect for intermediates looking for softly flowing practices which will provide a gentle challenge to their home practice.",4,A series of yoga practices which allow for variety & growth,1093305600,"08 24, 2004",2004,2850,"['four', 'videos', 'set', 'provide', 'nice', 'variety', 'yoga', 'practices', 'are', 'applicable', 'wide', 'range', 'yoga', 'practitioners', 'experienced', 'beginners', 'more', 'advanced', 'yoga', 'students', 'videos', 'are', 'led', 'Rainbeau', 'Mars', 'who', 'voiceover', 'instruction', 'calm', 'soothing', 'voice', 'mirrored', 'cueing', 'excellent', 'sometimes', 'slightly', 'out-of-sync', 'movements', 'screen', 'obviously', 'very', 'knowledgeable', 'yogic', 'principles', 'traditions', 'as', 'well', 'anatomical', 'issues', 'addition', 'videos', 'are', 'filmed', 'Hawaii', 'beautiful', 'backdrops.The', 'most', 'basic', 'practice', 'series', 'Pure', 'Tranquility', 'designed', 'prepare', 'body', 'mind', 'meditation', 'entire', 'practice', 'performed', 'seated', 'position', 'Rainbeau', 'guides', 'gentle', 'stretches', 'open', 'body', 'relax', 'muscles', 'Beginners', 'video', 'actually', 'bit', 'challenge', 'pre-existing', 'strength', 'practice', 'Rainbeau', 'slowly', 'breathing', 'exercises', 'warm-up', 'stretches', 'several', 'vinyasa', 'flow', 'series', 'still', 'moving', 'slowly', 'holding', 'poses', 'such', 'downward', 'dog', 'extended', 'period', 'time.The', 'remaining', 'two', 'videos', 'set', 'are', 'significantly', 'more', 'challenging', 'first', 'two', 'Pure', 'Power', 'Rainbeau', 'series', 'sun', 'salutations', 'adding', 'rigorous', 'poses', 'such', 'side', 'plank', 'crescent', 'lunges', 'chair', '3-legged', 'down', 'dog', 'Pure', 'Sweat', 'further', 'up', 'pace', 'adding', 'additional', 'lunges', 'twists', 'as', 'well', 'plenty', 'yogi', 'push-ups', 'chatturangas', 'two', 'practices', 'are', 'definitely', 'intermediate/advanced', 'level', 'Rainbeau', 'leisurely', 'pace', 'not', 'include', 'inversions', 'thus', 'making', 'practices', 'extremely', 'things', 'like', 'best', 'series', 'video', 'only', '30', 'minutes', 'long', 'especially', 'rare', 'intermediate/advanced', 'practices', 'However', 'videos', 'could', 'be', 'easily', 'combined', 'form', 'hour', 'long', 'workout', 'desired', 'Beginners', 'would', 'make', 'perfect', 'warm-up', 'Pure', 'Sweat', 'Pure', 'Tranquility', 'would', 'work', 'well', 'winding', 'down', 'Pure', 'Power.As', 'intermediate', 'yogi', 'who', 'been', 'practicing', 'yoga', 'several', 'years', 'now', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'set', 'totally', 'new', 'yoga', 'Rainbeau', 'cueing', 'excellent', 'instruction', 'not', 'overly', 'detailed', 'not', 'offer', 'modifications', 'poses', 'However', 'beginners', 'who', 'have', 'had', 'prior', 'experience', 'yoga', 'can', 'start', 'first', 'two', 'videos', 'build', 'up', 'remaining', 'two', 'time', 'Finally', 'series', 'not', 'someone', 'who', 'looking', 'fast-paced', 'power', 'yoga', 'ashtanga-type', 'practice', 'everything', 'Rainbeau', 'laid', 'back', 'relaxed', 'Rather', 'set', 'perfect', 'intermediates', 'looking', 'softly', 'flowing', 'practices', 'will', 'provide', 'gentle', 'challenge', 'home', 'practice']","Sacred Yoga Practice with Rainbeau Mars: Vinyasa Flow - 4 Volume Gift Set Beginners, Pure Tranquility, Pure Power, Pure Sweat  VHS"
726307,A17TDSX354MP7Y,B00007AJHS,CPTScott,"[10, 10]","This 4 tape set by Rainbeau Mars is a treasure of Yoga Gold with many unique colours. I love this set so much that I'm reviewing it for the second time now that I've gotten to use it for well over a year.If you only owned one set of Yoga Videos I would say this would be one of my top choices without a doubt (and this opinion is based on my experience with over 70 yoga programs in addition to studying with an amazing teacher). The reason I would choose this particular set is that there is so much variety between these tapes that you can choose one on any given day depending on your level of energy or depending on what you want to focus on.What is special about this series is that each of these programs is completely unique. Many Sets of Yoga programs are basically the same routine with more poses added (or harder variations) rather than unique programs unto themselves. Rather these programs are completely different from each other. What's nice about this is that you can actually alternate these programs each day or combine them if you have more time without the routines overlapping.The first two tapes ""Beginners"" and ""Pure Tranquility"" are gentle tapes that let you melt into wonderful yoga flows that will make you feel incredible as you open up your body, mind and spirit with movement and breath.The last two tapes ""Pure Power"" and ""Pure Sweat"" will challenge you and push you to new levels of strength, endurance and flexibility while maintaining the true essence of yoga which is awareness and breathing.Rainbeau Mars is a wonderful and inspiring teacher who comes across with real depth and sincerity. You feel like she's right there with you leading you through the practice. She's a real yoga teacher and not an aerobics teacher who decided to do a yoga video because it's the ""in thing"" .Also, these tapes clock in at about 30 minutes so they are very easy to fit into anyone's schedule so there are not reasons to ever skip a day of Yoga.When your ready to move on to a wonderful intermediate practice I also recommend Sherri Baptiste Freeman's ""Power Of Yoga"" which is available on Amazon as well (see my detailed review).Highly recommended!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Namaste",5,The Many Colors of Rainbeau's Yoga,1074297600,"01 17, 2004",2004,2191,"['4', 'tape', 'set', 'Rainbeau', 'Mars', 'treasure', 'Yoga', 'Gold', 'many', 'unique', 'colours', 'love', 'set', 'so', 'much', ""'m"", 'reviewing', 'second', 'time', 'now', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'use', 'well', 'year.If', 'only', 'owned', 'one', 'set', 'Yoga', 'Videos', 'would', 'say', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'top', 'choices', 'doubt', 'opinion', 'based', 'experience', '70', 'yoga', 'programs', 'addition', 'studying', 'amazing', 'teacher', 'reason', 'would', 'choose', 'particular', 'set', 'so', 'much', 'variety', 'tapes', 'can', 'choose', 'one', 'given', 'day', 'depending', 'level', 'energy', 'depending', 'want', 'focus', 'on.What', 'special', 'series', 'programs', 'completely', 'unique', 'Many', 'Sets', 'Yoga', 'programs', 'are', 'basically', 'same', 'routine', 'more', 'poses', 'added', 'harder', 'variations', 'rather', 'unique', 'programs', 'unto', 'Rather', 'programs', 'are', 'completely', 'different', 'other', 'What', 'nice', 'can', 'actually', 'alternate', 'programs', 'day', 'combine', 'have', 'more', 'time', 'routines', 'overlapping.The', 'first', 'two', 'tapes', 'Beginners', 'Pure', 'Tranquility', 'are', 'gentle', 'tapes', 'let', 'melt', 'wonderful', 'yoga', 'will', 'make', 'feel', 'incredible', 'open', 'up', 'body', 'mind', 'spirit', 'movement', 'breath.The', 'last', 'two', 'tapes', 'Pure', 'Power', 'Pure', 'Sweat', 'will', 'challenge', 'push', 'new', 'levels', 'strength', 'endurance', 'flexibility', 'maintaining', 'true', 'essence', 'yoga', 'awareness', 'breathing.Rainbeau', 'Mars', 'wonderful', 'inspiring', 'teacher', 'who', 'real', 'depth', 'sincerity', 'feel', 'right', 'there', 'leading', 'practice', 'real', 'yoga', 'teacher', 'not', 'aerobics', 'teacher', 'who', 'decided', 'do', 'yoga', 'video', 'thing', '.Also', 'tapes', 'clock', '30', 'minutes', 'are', 'very', 'easy', 'fit', 'anyone', 'schedule', 'are', 'not', 'reasons', 'ever', 'skip', 'day', 'Yoga.When', 'ready', 'move', 'wonderful', 'intermediate', 'practice', 'also', 'recommend', 'Sherri', 'Baptiste', 'Freeman', 'Power', 'Yoga', 'available', 'Amazon', 'as', 'well', 'see', 'detailed', 'review', '.Highly', 'recommended', 'Namaste']","Sacred Yoga Practice with Rainbeau Mars: Vinyasa Flow - 4 Volume Gift Set Beginners, Pure Tranquility, Pure Power, Pure Sweat  VHS"

726309,A2066JC1FGIEAT,B00007AJHS,Nadira Jamal of the Improvisation Toolkit,"[9, 9]","I really like this set. Rainbeau is a lovely instructor: she has a very sweet, calm and encouraging presence, and  the slow flow style of these programs is exactly what I wanted.  I never got the PEACE aspect of yoga begore.I've tried Iyengar yoga (tapes and and classes), but the ""let's do pose A.  Okay, now let's do pose B"" format felt too fragmented and, well, like exercise.  I tried power yoga as well (DVDs from two instructors), but I always felt like I was rushing to keep up.  Rainbeau's slowly-flowing sequences were a perfect balance:  the smooth progression of poses made the whole program feel like a single dance, which really kept me in the moment.  I always had enough time to mindfully execute the transition between poses, and enough time to really feel the poses as I held them.That's not to say it's easy: moving slowly is actually harder than moving quickly, because it's easier to cut corners when you go quickly.  Going slowly forces you to use the muscles that support the intermediate positions that you pass through on the way.  Plus, the poses can be as intense as you need them to be, as long as you choose the appropriate disk for your level, and push yourself to do each one with intention and commitment.My only complaint:  in the beginner program, there seems to be an error in the voiceover timing during the alternating lunges section.  If you follow her voice exactly, you'll end up doing your lunge on the second leg for much longer than on the first.  Once I figured this out, it was easy to deal with, but it's something to watch out for.",5,Wonderful flow,1136073600,"01 1, 2006",2006,1577,"['really', 'set', 'Rainbeau', 'lovely', 'instructor', 'very', 'sweet', 'calm', 'encouraging', 'presence', 'slow', 'flow', 'style', 'programs', 'exactly', 'what', 'wanted', 'never', 'got', 'PEACE', 'aspect', 'yoga', 'begore.I', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'Iyengar', 'yoga', 'tapes', 'classes', 'let', 'do', 'pose', 'A', 'Okay', 'now', 'let', 'do', 'pose', 'B', 'format', 'felt', 'too', 'fragmented', 'well', 'exercise', 'tried', 'power', 'yoga', 'as', 'well', 'DVDs', 'two', 'instructors', 'always', 'felt', 'was', 'rushing', 'keep', 'up', 'Rainbeau', 'slowly-flowing', 'sequences', 'were', 'perfect', 'balance', 'smooth', 'progression', 'poses', 'made', 'whole', 'program', 'feel', 'single', 'dance', 'really', 'kept', 'moment', 'always', 'had', 'enough', 'time', 'mindfully', 'execute', 'transition', 'poses', 'enough', 'time', 'really', 'feel', 'poses', 'held', 'them.That', 'not', 'say', 'easy', 'moving', 'slowly', 'actually', 'harder', 'moving', 'quickly', 'easier', 'cut', 'corners', 'when', 'go', 'quickly', 'Going', 'slowly', 'forces', 'use', 'muscles', 'support', 'intermediate', 'positions', 'pass', 'way', 'poses', 'can', 'be', 'as', 'intense', 'need', 'be', 'as', 'long', 'choose', 'appropriate', 'disk', 'level', 'push', 'do', 'one', 'intention', 'commitment.My', 'only', 'complaint', 'beginner', 'program', 'be', 'error', 'voiceover', 'timing', 'alternating', 'section', 'follow', 'voice', 'exactly', ""'ll"", 'end', 'up', 'doing', 'lunge', 'second', 'leg', 'much', 'longer', 'first', 'Once', 'figured', 'out', 'was', 'easy', 'deal', 'something', 'watch', 'out']","Sacred Yoga Practice with Rainbeau Mars: Vinyasa Flow - 4 Volume Gift Set Beginners, Pure Tranquility, Pure Power, Pure Sweat  VHS"

I have several yoga tapes but the ""Beginners"" volume of this set has been my favorite since I purchased three months ago. It's gentle but challenging, especially if you listen carefully to her instructions. I also like the fact that she incorporates some of the philosophy of yoga into the practice, bringing a spiritual dimension that -- depending on your mood -- can feel quite uplifting. And Rainbeau's emphasis on the importance of coordinating breath and movement adds yet another dimension, making this feel like a very full practice, though it is only about a half hour.Rainbeau is a great instructor. She is a very positive and encouraging throughout. It's as close to having the benefits of a ""live"" instructor as I've found.The ""Tranquility"" tape is also great. Though I prefer ""Beginners"" as a daily practice, I do enjoy this tape for night or weekend practices, or when I have a greater need to unwind from stress. It is designed to prepare you for meditation, though I simply use it to stretch and decompress. As an inflexible person, I did find some of the stretches a little painful and slightly injured myself doing one. I need to remind myself to take it easy and accept my limitations. On the whole, though, it's a very mellow and satisfying practice.I have tried to do the other two volumes of the set, but found them too difficult. I like that I have them, with the idea that it's something to work toward: to get to the point where I have the flexibility and stamina to make it completely through one.
