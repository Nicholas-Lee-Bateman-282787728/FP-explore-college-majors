It is fun to watch, and I have loaned it to many friends, some of whom bought their own copies.  I liked it so well that I bought two more  - one for my son and one for my son-in-law.",5,My Favorite DVD!,1386374400,"12 7, 2013",2013,370,"['had', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'year', 'ago', 'absolutely', 'fascinating', 'Mr.', 'Soskin', 'headed', 'up', 'tour', 'following', 'same', 'path', 'England', 'would', 'definitely', 'sign', 'up', 'fun', 'watch', 'have', 'loaned', 'many', 'friends', 'whom', 'bought', 'own', 'copies', 'liked', 'so', 'well', 'bought', 'two', 'more', 'one', 'son', 'one', 'son-in-law']",Standing With Stones: A Journey Through Megalithic Britain

The  film quality was excellent. Rupert Soskin presented a very good general explanation of  the sites.  I  saw megalithic  sites that  I will probably never visit.  Any further studyof  the  sites I  can obtain through  books or  internet.  I  have added the Standing With  Stones DVD to  my  DVD archaeologicalcollections.

1234885,A1G3BV4IAOWDU5,B001SGEUBK,Gary E. Welsh,"[0, 0]","Being from the U.S; I have been always intrigued by the Megalithic stone sites in the British Isles and Ireland, I picked up this video to try to get a better understanding of what they were all about.  This video is basically a travelogue of Megalithic sites that the production team visited, with seemingly expert commentary and a history about each site.  The production values are very high and an effort was taken to visually present each site at its best, regarding natural lighting and viewing angles.  Although this is a private production, it could easily have been a very high class PBS presentation. A large number of sites were visited/recorded, most of the well known ones are here; but, also it includes a great number of sites that seemed to be well off the beaten track.The only negative thing I can say is that I was hoping to understand how and why the peoples of that era spent the time and energy, as they must have done, and just how they made use of them in their culture.  That is not the film's fault.  I've have never read/heard that science has made that determination yet  ... much of these Megalithic sites remain, and maybe always will, an enigma.",5,"Travelogue of various types of Megalithic sites across Britian, Ireland, and the Scottish Isles",1389312000,"01 10, 2014",2014,1176,"['Being', 'U.S', 'have', 'been', 'always', 'intrigued', 'Megalithic', 'stone', 'British', 'Isles', 'Ireland', 'picked', 'up', 'video', 'try', 'get', 'better', 'understanding', 'what', 'were', 'about', 'video', 'basically', 'travelogue', 'Megalithic', 'production', 'team', 'visited', 'seemingly', 'expert', 'commentary', 'history', 'site', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'very', 'high', 'effort', 'was', 'taken', 'visually', 'present', 'site', 'best', 'regarding', 'natural', 'lighting', 'viewing', 'angles', 'private', 'production', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'high', 'class', 'PBS', 'presentation', 'large', 'number', 'sites', 'were', 'visited/recorded', 'most', 'well', 'known', 'ones', 'are', 'here', 'also', 'great', 'number', 'sites', 'seemed', 'be', 'well', 'beaten', 'only', 'negative', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'was', 'hoping', 'understand', 'how', 'why', 'peoples', 'era', 'spent', 'time', 'energy', 'must', 'have', 'done', 'just', 'how', 'made', 'use', 'culture', 'not', 'film', 'fault', ""'ve"", 'have', 'never', 'read/heard', 'science', 'made', 'determination', 'yet', 'much', 'Megalithic', 'sites', 'remain', 'maybe', 'always', 'will', 'enigma']",Standing With Stones: A Journey Through Megalithic Britain

The stuff that dreams are made on, that invisible thing inside all of us, that spirit somehow permeates this transcendental documentary like attending a religious service...without any mention of dogma, faith, psalm or prayer.

1234888,A4Q65S8MUUMY5,B001SGEUBK,Michael Gunther,"[13, 14]","""Standing With Stones"" is a two-hour video tour of over one hundred (!) megalithic sites in Great Britain. It's great to visit so many spots at once, but the downside is that very little time can be spent at any given place. Even Stonehenge is given only a very short scene in the video. The film's writer (and on-camera host) is an enthusiast, not an expert; there isn't much interpretation and analysis, nor even many facts, to be had on this video. (It is useful, though, to be reminded how little we really know about these ancient places). The photography is quite well done, and adds measurably to one's enjoyment of the DVD.To summarize, this is a pleasant video that will appeal to people who would like a brief tour of (lots of) British megalithic sites. However, viewers who want more details about these places are likely to come away disappointed.",3,"Nice, But Low On Content",1255132800,"10 10, 2009",2009,859,"['Standing', 'Stones', 'two-hour', 'video', 'tour', 'one', 'hundred', 'megalithic', 'sites', 'Great', 'Britain', 'great', 'visit', 'so', 'many', 'spots', 'once', 'downside', 'very', 'little', 'time', 'can', 'be', 'spent', 'given', 'place', 'Even', 'Stonehenge', 'given', 'only', 'very', 'short', 'scene', 'video', 'film', 'writer', 'on-camera', 'host', 'enthusiast', 'not', 'expert', ""n't"", 'much', 'interpretation', 'analysis', 'even', 'many', 'facts', 'be', 'had', 'video', 'useful', 'though', 'be', 'reminded', 'how', 'little', 'really', 'know', 'ancient', 'places', 'photography', 'quite', 'well', 'done', 'measurably', 'one', 'enjoyment', 'DVD.To', 'summarize', 'pleasant', 'video', 'will', 'appeal', 'people', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'brief', 'tour', 'lots', 'British', 'megalithic', 'sites', 'However', 'viewers', 'who', 'want', 'more', 'details', 'places', 'are', 'likely', 'come', 'away', 'disappointed']",Standing With Stones: A Journey Through Megalithic Britain
