739627,A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,B00008DDWN,"Christopher Barrett ""Evil Corgi""","[0, 0]","By today's steep animation standards, Orphen looks a little dated. However, one should notice the care and attention to many details the animators used despite the absence of computer modified animation. The characters are likeable and well portrayed. Though there are issues and flaws, many of these are minor and easily overlooked. The story is engaging and full of surprises. Of particular note: the two trolls who seem to always cause Orphen a ton of trouble are wonderful comedic additions.The anime gets high marks for fun, action, and characterization. Lower marks due to some inconsistency in the story and plot, as well as merely average voice acting.Overall this is a worthy, classic anime addition to any library.",5,A classic wizard and warrior series ~,1198022400,"12 19, 2007",2007,724,"['today', 'steep', 'animation', 'standards', 'Orphen', 'little', 'dated', 'However', 'one', 'should', 'notice', 'care', 'attention', 'many', 'details', 'animators', 'used', 'absence', 'computer', 'modified', 'animation', 'characters', 'are', 'likeable', 'well', 'portrayed', 'are', 'issues', 'flaws', 'many', 'are', 'minor', 'easily', 'overlooked', 'story', 'engaging', 'full', 'surprises', 'particular', 'note', 'two', 'trolls', 'who', 'seem', 'always', 'cause', 'Orphen', 'ton', 'trouble', 'are', 'wonderful', 'comedic', 'additions.The', 'anime', 'high', 'marks', 'fun', 'action', 'characterization', 'Lower', 'marks', 'due', 'inconsistency', 'story', 'plot', 'as', 'well', 'merely', 'average', 'voice', 'acting.Overall', 'worthy', 'classic', 'anime', 'addition', 'library']",Orphen - The Perfect Collection

Im glad ADV is releasing this as a box set, they are one of the few reasonable anime distributors. Everyone else wants to rip you off now a days ex: Bandai, Pioneer, etc. Great story and great characters, leaves you wanting to see more when youre finished, too bad the sequel is not as dark and mysterious as the original. Story goes something like this, Orphen is a sorcerer on a mission to save his friend Ashley who was turned into a dragon, as a dragon Ashley is verry destructive and dangerous. Orphen will stop at nothing to restore his friend back to human form even if it means sacrificing his own life. Im not good at writing descriptions, amazon probably has a better more detailed description. Anyway trust me this is one of the better series out there.",5,"Awesome series, been waiting for a box set!!",1049241600,"04 2, 2003",2003,852,"['great', 'series', 'originally', 'owned', 'Japan', 'import', 'version', 'bad', 'subtitles', 'Im', 'glad', 'ADV', 'releasing', 'box', 'set', 'are', 'one', 'few', 'reasonable', 'anime', 'distributors', 'Everyone', 'else', 'rip', 'off', 'now', 'days', 'ex', 'Bandai', 'Pioneer', 'etc', 'Great', 'story', 'great', 'characters', 'wanting', 'see', 'more', 'when', 'youre', 'finished', 'too', 'bad', 'sequel', 'not', 'dark', 'mysterious', 'original', 'Story', 'something', 'Orphen', 'sorcerer', 'mission', 'save', 'friend', 'Ashley', 'who', 'was', 'turned', 'dragon', 'dragon', 'Ashley', 'verry', 'destructive', 'dangerous', 'Orphen', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'restore', 'friend', 'back', 'human', 'form', 'even', 'sacrificing', 'own', 'life', 'Im', 'not', 'good', 'writing', 'descriptions', 'amazon', 'probably', 'better', 'more', 'detailed', 'description', 'Anyway', 'one', 'better', 'series', 'there']",Orphen - The Perfect Collection

I liked the english and japanese dub, about 5 of the 24 episodes i switched to japanese because the english voices were annoying in those particular episodes.  Majic, orphens apprentice is voiced by the guy that did shenji in evangelion, everyone noes how notorious he is to being one of the most whiny and annoying characters in anime.  one more thing,  the ending is just too nice, no braveheart ending here folks.  I bought the import for $13, and it was of great quality, beautiful fold out boxed set.

739630,A3FIKATQ286DMV,B00008DDWN,Niko,"[13, 15]","When I first bought Orphen, I was not sure if I did the right thing. I cannot claim that I am a maniac, but the least I expect from an anime is that the animation should be at least good, the music should be good but most of all the storyline should be interesting.In the case of Orphen I would say that the animation - in my humble opinion- is very good, I fell in love with the music and as for the storyline it is unique. For instance, watching ""Grave of the fireflies"", the music is very good, the animation fair but the story etc. made it one of the best animes ever. The same as Orphen, in its category I definitely will say that it will become one of the best of its kind. The story begins somewhere in the middle, and it unfolds not just forwards, but backwards as well, putting the pieces together with a lot of action.After watching all the episodes I was sure that the money I spent for it was a good decision (thanks god) because it was funny, dramatic, emotional and very interesting.AS FOR THE STORY:Orphen, the main protagonist, is a sorcerer who is trying to save his female friend, with who he grew up together as orphens and are like brother and sister, Ashley who was turned into a dragon, which is very destructive and dangerous. Clio is the girl that will fall in love with him and follow him everywhere, not to mention the fact that she will support him in everyway possible. Magic, is a young teen who is something like Orphens pupil and wants to learn magic from him. Well, most of the times Orphen proofs himself to be a rip-off, something that changes later on. Additionally, the Magician Guilt (where Orphen and Ashley were magician students)is divided in that: Some of them help Orphen and some try to kill him. To sum up, Orphen will stop at nothing to safe Ashley and return her to her previous human form, even if he has to sacrifice his own life.As for you people who are not sure what to do I highly recommend the shows!!!",5,5 Stars because...,1099526400,"11 4, 2004",2004,1955,"['When', 'first', 'bought', 'Orphen', 'was', 'not', 'sure', 'did', 'right', 'thing', 'can', 'not', 'claim', 'am', 'maniac', 'least', 'expect', 'anime', 'animation', 'should', 'be', 'least', 'good', 'music', 'should', 'be', 'good', 'most', 'storyline', 'should', 'be', 'interesting.In', 'case', 'Orphen', 'would', 'say', 'animation', 'humble', 'opinion-', 'very', 'good', 'fell', 'love', 'music', 'storyline', 'unique', 'instance', 'watching', 'Grave', 'fireflies', 'music', 'very', 'good', 'animation', 'fair', 'story', 'etc', 'made', 'one', 'best', 'animes', 'ever', 'same', 'Orphen', 'category', 'definitely', 'will', 'say', 'will', 'become', 'one', 'best', 'kind', 'story', 'somewhere', 'middle', 'not', 'just', 'forwards', 'backwards', 'as', 'well', 'putting', 'pieces', 'together', 'lot', 'action.After', 'watching', 'episodes', 'was', 'sure', 'money', 'spent', 'was', 'good', 'decision', 'thanks', 'god', 'was', 'funny', 'dramatic', 'emotional', 'very', 'interesting.AS', 'THE', 'STORY', 'Orphen', 'main', 'protagonist', 'sorcerer', 'who', 'trying', 'save', 'female', 'friend', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'together', 'orphens', 'are', 'brother', 'sister', 'Ashley', 'who', 'was', 'turned', 'dragon', 'very', 'destructive', 'dangerous', 'Clio', 'girl', 'will', 'fall', 'love', 'follow', 'everywhere', 'not', 'mention', 'fact', 'will', 'support', 'everyway', 'possible', 'Magic', 'young', 'teen', 'who', 'something', 'Orphens', 'pupil', 'learn', 'magic', 'Well', 'most', 'times', 'Orphen', 'be', 'rip-off', 'something', 'later', 'Additionally', 'Magician', 'Guilt', 'where', 'Orphen', 'Ashley', 'were', 'magician', 'students', 'divided', 'help', 'Orphen', 'try', 'kill', 'sum', 'up', 'Orphen', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'safe', 'Ashley', 'return', 'previous', 'human', 'form', 'even', 'sacrifice', 'own', 'life.As', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'do', 'highly', 'recommend', 'shows']",Orphen - The Perfect Collection
739631,AFMOGEUDSM9RI,B00008DDWN,Spirit Wolf,"[21, 21]","Having gone into Orphen with no idea what to expect, I was pleasantly surprised from the beginning. I'm not normally a fan of fantasy titles, but there was something about this one that just demanded I keep watching.The story is the highlight here; it's interesting and mysterious from the get-go and unfolds excellently throughout the series. One of my favorite aspects about this series is that it sort of begins in the middle of the story, and it unfolds not just forwards, but backwards as well, slowly piecing the past together via flashbacks and revelations.I found the characters to be interesting and enjoyable. They made me laugh when I needed to, and made me sympathetic at just the right moments. Most interesting is the way things are turned on their head halfway through the series; you'll find yourself wondering who's an enemy and who isn't.In the end, I thoroughly enjoyed this series. It was funny, intruiging, and dramatic. This is a title that definitely gets overlooked far too much; take my advice and check it out. I highly recommend it.",5,A fantastic experience,1069027200,"11 17, 2003",2003,1059,"['Having', 'gone', 'Orphen', 'idea', 'what', 'expect', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'beginning', ""'m"", 'not', 'normally', 'fan', 'fantasy', 'titles', 'was', 'something', 'one', 'just', 'demanded', 'keep', 'watching.The', 'story', 'highlight', 'here', 'interesting', 'mysterious', 'get-go', 'unfolds', 'excellently', 'series', 'One', 'favorite', 'aspects', 'series', 'sort', 'begins', 'middle', 'story', 'not', 'just', 'forwards', 'backwards', 'as', 'well', 'slowly', 'piecing', 'past', 'together', 'flashbacks', 'revelations.I', 'found', 'characters', 'be', 'interesting', 'enjoyable', 'made', 'when', 'needed', 'made', 'sympathetic', 'just', 'right', 'moments', 'Most', 'interesting', 'way', 'things', 'are', 'turned', 'head', 'halfway', 'series', ""'ll"", 'find', 'wondering', 'who', 'enemy', 'who', ""isn't.In"", 'end', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'was', 'funny', 'intruiging', 'dramatic', 'title', 'definitely', 'overlooked', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'take', 'advice', 'check', 'out', 'highly', 'recommend']",Orphen - The Perfect Collection
