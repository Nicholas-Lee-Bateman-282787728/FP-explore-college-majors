The acting talent is there and the story seemed like it could have been interesting, but this film is slow and boring.  Each scene seems to go on endlessly.  Each plot point is unendingly belabored.  There are numerous inexplicable scenes which only serve to muddle up the story line further.  By the time the film moves from one plot point to another you've nearly forgotten what came before.  This film left me scratching my head trying to figure out what happened.  Completely forgettable.

The story leads to very predictable places, but Clea DuVall and Darryl Hannah are each absolutely stunning.  A fan (more of an obsessor) of Clea DuVall, I HAD to have this film - and it is FAR better than the Astronaut's Wife or Little Witches - but not nearly as good as Girl, Interrupted or But I'm a Cheerleader.I'd only recommend this to people who want to watch acting, and don't need a very interesting story.",4,Predictable... but beautiful none-the-same.,1003968000,"10 25, 2001",2001,522,"['story', 'friendship', '2', 'women', 'one', 'young', 'tomboy-ish', 'girl', 'older', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'story', 'very', 'predictable', 'places', 'Clea', 'DuVall', 'Darryl', 'Hannah', 'are', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'fan', 'more', 'obsessor', 'Clea', 'DuVall', 'HAD', 'have', 'film', 'FAR', 'better', 'Astronaut', 'Wife', 'Little', 'Witches', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'Girl', 'Interrupted', ""'m"", 'Cheerleader.I', ""'d"", 'only', 'recommend', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'watch', 'acting', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'very', 'interesting', 'story']",Wildflowers

If you are a Daryl Hannah fan, don't worry, she's prettier than ever. And if you are curious about Clea DuVall, well, she's proven all her potentials for stardom in this movie.

486382,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,6305979367,Westley,"[4, 5]","Wildflowers is about 17-year-old Cally's search for her past.  She was raised on a commune by hippies in the 1960's (the movie is set in 1985), and now she lives with her father.  She's been told little about her mother, except that she had to leave Cally and her father because she got in trouble for her political activities.  Cally becomes convinced that the woman she meets in San Francisco (Daryl Hannah) is her mother, and she tries to become friends with the woman.  As she learns more about the woman and her father, she also begins to understand herself better.  The story is simple and straight forward, and the style and acting are extremely low-key. Although the movie is not great by any standards, it is fairly likeable.  Look fast for a quick appearance by Blue's Traveller.  Overall, a very average small-budget film.",2,Meandering but likeable coming of age movie,1021334400,"05 14, 2002",2002,833,"['Wildflowers', '17-year-old', 'Cally', 'search', 'past', 'was', 'raised', 'commune', 'hippies', '1960', 'movie', 'set', '1985', 'now', 'father', 'been', 'told', 'little', 'mother', 'had', 'leave', 'Cally', 'father', 'got', 'trouble', 'political', 'activities', 'Cally', 'convinced', 'woman', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Daryl', 'Hannah', 'mother', 'become', 'friends', 'woman', 'more', 'woman', 'father', 'also', 'understand', 'better', 'story', 'simple', 'straight', 'forward', 'style', 'acting', 'are', 'extremely', 'low-key', 'movie', 'not', 'great', 'standards', 'fairly', 'likeable', 'Look', 'fast', 'quick', 'appearance', 'Blue', 'Traveller', 'Overall', 'very', 'average', 'small-budget', 'film']",Wildflowers
