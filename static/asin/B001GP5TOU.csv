Being a middle-aged life-long Boston/New England Patriots fan I would love to own a boxed set of our 10 greatest games. But going by this selection it would seem that all the greatest games were played after the year 2000? We didn't have a single exciting contest for 40 years? We appeared in 2 Super Bowls before 2000 and didn't have one challenging game getting there.All those nasty & vindictive contests vs. the Steelers and Raiders back in the 1970's or the boarder-wars with the New York Jets. Games that were dubbed ""The Fog Bowl"", ""The Tuna Bowl"" and ""Squish the Fish"". In 1976 we had a TD by QB rushing record set that would stand for 35 years. In 1978 we set an NFL single season team rushing record with 3,156 total yards with 4 different players gaining at least 500 yards each. In 1994 QB Drew Bledsoe set a single game record with 70 passing attempts.During all these events and all these games we didn't have a single notable contest until after 2000?BS!",2,Good Purchase For Bandwagon Fans,1404691200,"07 7, 2014",2014,1010,"['listing', 'always', 'Being', 'middle-aged', 'life-long', 'Boston/New', 'England', 'Patriots', 'fan', 'would', 'love', 'own', 'boxed', 'set', '10', 'greatest', 'games', 'going', 'selection', 'would', 'seem', 'greatest', 'games', 'were', 'played', 'year', '2000', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'single', 'exciting', 'contest', '40', 'years', 'appeared', '2', 'Super', 'Bowls', '2000', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'one', 'challenging', 'game', 'getting', 'there.All', 'nasty', 'vindictive', 'contests', 'Steelers', 'Raiders', 'back', '1970', 'boarder-wars', 'New', 'York', 'Jets', 'Games', 'were', 'dubbed', 'Fog', 'Bowl', 'Tuna', 'Bowl', 'Squish', 'Fish', '1976', 'had', 'TD', 'QB', 'rushing', 'record', 'set', 'would', 'stand', '35', 'years', '1978', 'set', 'NFL', 'single', 'season', 'team', 'rushing', 'record', '3,156', 'total', 'yards', '4', 'different', 'players', 'gaining', 'least', '500', 'yards', '1994', 'QB', 'Drew', 'Bledsoe', 'set', 'single', 'game', 'record', '70', 'passing', 'attempts.During', 'events', 'games', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'single', 'notable', 'contest', '2000', 'BS']",NFL GREATEST GAMES SERIES:NEW ENGLAND

The reason you have to pay a hundred grand for this set is because it was never officially released in the first place. If you're old enough to know what I'm talking about, this is equivalent to the Blank figure from the Dick Tracy toy line. It practically doesn't exist. If you're got 1/10th of a million dollars to blow, go for it. Otherwise, just watch the highlights on YouTube.Rated 5 stars for what could have been a great set.
