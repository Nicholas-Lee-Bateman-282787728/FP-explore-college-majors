This is a very touching movie which portrays the life of a very beautiful and talented woman who's life was tragically cut short by the president of her fan club and someone who Selena trusted with her business dealings as well. We see Selena grow up from a little girl who loved Donna Summer to the famous Latino star she became. We see the hard road that she and her family had to travel in order to reach the much deserved fame she encountered. We also get to experience the love story between Selena and Chris ( played by Jon Seda ) and how determined Selena was to marry the love of her life. Jennifer Lopez was the perfect choice to play Selena. She did an excellent job portraying Selena. In many scenes in the film, you would think that it's the real Selena on stage performing. The soundtrack is awesome also. The casting of the movie was excellent also. If anyone is interested in this movie or the story of Selena, I strongly urge you to buy this movie... you won't be sorry. Although ending tragically, you get to experience the journey of a woman who lived out her dream, if only for a short time.

I have to admit I would have preferred that they didn't embellish the movie even a tiny bit as I later learnt the initial meeting between Selena and Chris was not as shown in the movie but a decision made for movies sake...a shame.Having loved this movie and having watched it so many times during the years, when my not so reliable VCR recently kicked the bucket I instantly ordered the DVD version as there was no way I would not have the opportunity to keep this amazing and moving story in my library of movies",5,Heartbreaking,1363478400,"03 17, 2013",2013,1365,"['bought', 'video', 'yes', 'said', 'video', 'movie', 'decade', 'ago', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'instantly', 'become', 'one', 'favourite', 'movies', 'unfortunate', 'truth', 'tragedy', 'demise', 'was', 'true', 'Someone', 'beautiful', 'angelic', 'person', 'beautiful', 'angelic', 'voice', 'had', 'been', 'struck', 'dead', 'way', 'time', 'selfish', 'individual', 'who', 'was', 'so', 'loved', 'Selena', 'talent', 'would', 'have', 'taken', 'sing', 'world', 'not', 'just', 'Latin', 'market', 'what', 'shame', 'first', 'crossover', 'occurred', 'death.I', 'also', 'have', 'give', 'credit', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'Jon', 'Seda', 'roles', 'Selena', 'love', 'husband', 'be', 'Chris', 'Perez', 'did', 'amazing', 'job', 'portraying', 'two', 'loversThe', 'extras', 'end', 'real', 'Selena', 'singing', 'especially', 'Donna', 'Summer', 'disco', 'medley', 'was', 'just', 'amazing', 'fitting', 'remembrance', 'loved', 'Tejano', 'singer', 'have', 'admit', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'did', ""n't"", 'embellish', 'movie', 'even', 'tiny', 'bit', 'later', 'initial', 'meeting', 'Selena', 'Chris', 'was', 'not', 'shown', 'movie', 'decision', 'made', 'movies', 'sake', 'shame.Having', 'loved', 'movie', 'having', 'watched', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'years', 'when', 'not', 'so', 'reliable', 'VCR', 'recently', 'kicked', 'bucket', 'instantly', 'ordered', 'DVD', 'version', 'was', 'way', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'opportunity', 'keep', 'amazing', 'moving', 'story', 'library', 'movies']",N/A

Edward James Olmos and Constance Marie were also great as Abraham and Marcella Quintilla. Edward James Olmos shows off his versatility and what a job they did with make-up and all that stuff for Constance Marie as her character got older on top of her top-notch performance. Jon Seda did a great as Selena's husband Chris along with Jacob Vargas playing A.B. and that actress who plays Suzie.

428962,ADS5APY1NKTL4,6304584229,"D. Pawl ""Dani""","[2, 2]","This was my introduction to the beautiful, legendary and irresistable Selena.  Selena Quintanilla Perez (played with fire and great love by Jennifer Lopez--the performance that made her a star), was a greatly talented and wonderful singer whose humble beginnings and soaring talent are chronicled in this well-made and engaging film.Gregory Nava, the director best known for the intense, beautiful, and ultimately tragic EL NORTE, captures the rise (and tragic fall) of the late, great Selena.  Selena was well-loved throughout the Spanish-speaking communities of  Texas and California, as well as in Mexico and Central America, for her sizzling tejano cumbia, her ballads, mariachi, pop and, finally, her English crossover music, recorded on the eve of her murder at the hands of deranged fan/former fan club president Yolanda Saldivar.  Gregory reunites with Jennifer Lopez, Edward James Olmos (as Abraham Quintanilla, Selena's father), and Jacob Vargas (as AB Quintanilla, her brother) who were previously seen together in MI FAMILIA.We get a sense of Selena's life, from her musical beginnings with her band, Selena y Los Dinos, a band first put together by her father, Abraham, a former do wop singer, with her brother AB on guitar and sister Suzette, on drums.  Selena, whose true calling is to sing, quickly beomes famous and well-known.  Jennifer Lopez convincingly portrays Selena from her teen years through the end of her life at age twenty-three. She does a great job, even looks like her, has the dance moves down, and believably lip synchs.  The rest of the cast is great, too.  Edward James Olmos, Jacob Vargas and Constance Marie (as Marcella Quintanilla, Selena's mother) are especially noteworthy, as well as Jon Seda (as Chris Perez-Selena's lead guitarist, who eventually marries her--against the wishes of her family).This is a great film for everyone to see.  Whether you were a Selena fan long before her death in 1995, or you are newly becoming acquainted with her music, this film will touch your spirit.  How sad that such a beautiful performer was taken from us way too soon.  At least her legacy lives on in her music and in this great film.  You will find yourself dancing to the cumbias, and shedding tears at the end.",5,a great film for a great legend......,1111276800,"03 20, 2005",2005,2248,"['was', 'introduction', 'beautiful', 'legendary', 'irresistable', 'Selena', 'Selena', 'Quintanilla', 'Perez', 'played', 'fire', 'great', 'love', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'performance', 'made', 'star', 'was', 'greatly', 'talented', 'wonderful', 'singer', 'humble', 'beginnings', 'soaring', 'talent', 'are', 'chronicled', 'well-made', 'engaging', 'film.Gregory', 'Nava', 'director', 'best', 'known', 'intense', 'beautiful', 'ultimately', 'tragic', 'EL', 'NORTE', 'rise', 'tragic', 'fall', 'late', 'great', 'Selena', 'Selena', 'was', 'well-loved', 'Spanish-speaking', 'communities', 'Texas', 'California', 'as', 'well', 'Mexico', 'Central', 'America', 'sizzling', 'tejano', 'cumbia', 'ballads', 'mariachi', 'pop', 'finally', 'English', 'crossover', 'music', 'recorded', 'eve', 'murder', 'hands', 'deranged', 'fan/former', 'fan', 'club', 'president', 'Yolanda', 'Saldivar', 'Gregory', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'Edward', 'James', 'Olmos', 'Abraham', 'Quintanilla', 'Selena', 'father', 'Jacob', 'Vargas', 'AB', 'Quintanilla', 'brother', 'who', 'were', 'previously', 'seen', 'together', 'MI', 'FAMILIA.We', 'get', 'sense', 'Selena', 'life', 'musical', 'beginnings', 'band', 'Selena', 'y', 'Los', 'Dinos', 'band', 'first', 'put', 'together', 'father', 'Abraham', 'former', 'do', 'wop', 'singer', 'brother', 'AB', 'guitar', 'sister', 'Suzette', 'drums', 'Selena', 'true', 'calling', 'sing', 'quickly', 'famous', 'well-known', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'convincingly', 'Selena', 'teen', 'years', 'end', 'life', 'age', 'twenty-three', 'great', 'job', 'even', 'dance', 'down', 'believably', 'lip', 'synchs', 'rest', 'cast', 'great', 'too', 'Edward', 'James', 'Olmos', 'Jacob', 'Vargas', 'Constance', 'Marie', 'Marcella', 'Quintanilla', 'Selena', 'mother', 'are', 'especially', 'noteworthy', 'as', 'well', 'Jon', 'Seda', 'Chris', 'Perez-Selena', 'lead', 'guitarist', 'who', 'eventually', 'wishes', 'family', '.This', 'great', 'film', 'everyone', 'see', 'were', 'Selena', 'fan', 'long', 'death', '1995', 'are', 'newly', 'becoming', 'acquainted', 'music', 'film', 'will', 'touch', 'spirit', 'How', 'sad', 'beautiful', 'performer', 'was', 'taken', 'way', 'too', 'soon', 'least', 'legacy', 'music', 'great', 'film', 'will', 'find', 'dancing', 'cumbias', 'shedding', 'tears', 'end']",N/A

Other than that the picture is very nice to look at, the concert sequences are filled with deep, rich colors. A good example of this is Chapter 2 where Selena begins her last Houston Concert @ the Astrodome. Selena's purple bellbottom jump suit, sprinkled with silver sparkles show up so clearly and vivily it almost seems like a moving photograph.The D.D 5.1 Soundtrack IS, in my opinion perfect. While spilt-surround sound is heard through out the 128 min, the best examples are the concert sequences. For the 'Disco Medley' performance, the sound is deep and loud, with Selena's voice surrounding you as you watch. For the 'Dreaming of You' performance, Selena's beautiful voice echos through the room as if you were in that concert hall your self.The Supplements are low. Not one trailer.

428985,A2Q0ERQ25AQQNG,6304584229,Jonas Cukierman,"[1, 1]","Once in a great while, an overnight success hits the world. This was no exception when Selena Quintanilla-Perez, otherwise known as SELENA, hit the music kingdom with her transcendental story. Beginning as a Tejano music  vocalist, Selena became an individual to break barriers on more than one  front. Going from a specific audience to a world-renowned pop star is  difficult enough. But throw in the fact of being a woman of  Mexican-American decent, overcoming a domineering father and reaching a  larger and discriminating audience, and you have a huge task of coming out  on top.The humble beginnings of Ms. Perez set the mood for the base of  the film. Born in a small Texas town and performing the festival and lounge  circuit of such places, Selena is clearly determined to make a name for  herself and her family. Her father, Abraham Quintanilla (the always  cerebral Edward James Olmos), battling racist demons from his own past,  will stop at nothing to teach his children music in order to succeed where  he feels he failed. As Selena's manager and publicist, Abraham is the  protector of his nurturing family which gives Selena the confidence and  ambition to climb the ladder to success. But despite the close-knit  environment of the ubiquitous Quintanilla clan, Abraham is also the soul  dictator and &quot;lawmaker&quot; in the household. This conflict, combined  with everyday ups and downs of family disagreement, is what on one hand  creates Selena's success, but at the same time, makes for the overachieving  singer become at times blind to what goes on around her. Being that her  father never lets her venture on her own into the world, Selena is the  trusting and at times naive figure in this tragedy of monumental  proportions. The downfall, as many of us already know, is when Selena's fan  club manager, Yolanda Saldivar (Lupe Ontiveros from As Good As It Gets)  takes the singer's life in a sudden fit of frenzy over money issues.The  most disturbing and emotionally charged scene in the film is ironically  only a few moments long, towards the end of the film, with Selena onstage  and having a rose land in front of her as she begins singing. This rose of  course being the metaphor of being cut short in life and career. From  there, Dreaming Of You, one of Selena's most famous songs, plays in its  entirety as it takes us on a brief flashback of her career leading up to  her fatal collapse.This film has a universal feel and message. Thus,  even if you don't like the music of Selena (which is hardly featured in the  film anyway), you will be able to feel the shock of innocence being torn  away. In addition, despite it is at times a bit of a blur in that it moves  too fast, Selena will strike the vital nerves in that it is such a  beautifully acted and emotionally taxing film. Director Gregory Nava could  not have employed a better cast to display these characters for the human  beings (not pop-stars) that they are. Filled with experience and the magic  of growing up and taking flight, Selena is incisive and haunting in its  ability to move its audience through constant highs and lows. Jennifer  Lopez is a convincing mirror image of the Tejano superstar.",5,Sets the standard for musical biopics.,959040000,"05 23, 2000",2000,3203,"['Once', 'great', 'while', 'overnight', 'success', 'world', 'was', 'exception', 'when', 'Selena', 'Quintanilla-Perez', 'otherwise', 'known', 'SELENA', 'hit', 'music', 'kingdom', 'transcendental', 'story', 'Beginning', 'Tejano', 'music', 'vocalist', 'Selena', 'became', 'individual', 'break', 'barriers', 'more', 'one', 'front', 'Going', 'specific', 'audience', 'world-renowned', 'pop', 'star', 'difficult', 'enough', 'throw', 'fact', 'being', 'woman', 'Mexican-American', 'decent', 'overcoming', 'domineering', 'father', 'reaching', 'larger', 'discriminating', 'audience', 'have', 'huge', 'task', 'coming', 'out', 'top.The', 'humble', 'beginnings', 'Ms.', 'Perez', 'set', 'mood', 'base', 'film', 'Born', 'small', 'Texas', 'town', 'performing', 'festival', 'lounge', 'circuit', 'such', 'places', 'Selena', 'clearly', 'determined', 'make', 'name', 'herself', 'family', 'father', 'Abraham', 'Quintanilla', 'always', 'cerebral', 'Edward', 'James', 'Olmos', 'battling', 'racist', 'demons', 'own', 'past', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'teach', 'children', 'music', 'order', 'succeed', 'where', 'failed', 'Selena', 'manager', 'publicist', 'Abraham', 'protector', 'nurturing', 'family', 'Selena', 'confidence', 'ambition', 'climb', 'ladder', 'success', 'close-knit', 'environment', 'ubiquitous', 'Quintanilla', 'clan', 'Abraham', 'also', 'soul', 'dictator', 'quot', 'quot', 'household', 'conflict', 'combined', 'everyday', 'ups', 'downs', 'family', 'disagreement', 'what', 'one', 'hand', 'Selena', 'success', 'same', 'time', 'overachieving', 'singer', 'become', 'times', 'blind', 'what', 'Being', 'father', 'never', 'venture', 'own', 'world', 'Selena', 'trusting', 'times', 'naive', 'figure', 'tragedy', 'monumental', 'proportions', 'downfall', 'many', 'already', 'know', 'when', 'Selena', 'fan', 'club', 'manager', 'Yolanda', 'Saldivar', 'Lupe', 'Ontiveros', 'As', 'Good', 'singer', 'life', 'sudden', 'fit', 'frenzy', 'money', 'issues.The', 'most', 'disturbing', 'emotionally', 'charged', 'scene', 'film', 'ironically', 'only', 'few', 'moments', 'long', 'end', 'film', 'Selena', 'onstage', 'having', 'rose', 'land', 'front', 'singing', 'rose', 'course', 'being', 'metaphor', 'being', 'cut', 'short', 'life', 'career', 'there', 'Dreaming', 'one', 'Selena', 'most', 'famous', 'songs', 'plays', 'entirety', 'brief', 'flashback', 'career', 'leading', 'up', 'fatal', 'collapse.This', 'film', 'universal', 'feel', 'message', 'Thus', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'music', 'Selena', 'hardly', 'featured', 'film', 'anyway', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'feel', 'shock', 'innocence', 'being', 'torn', 'away', 'addition', 'times', 'bit', 'blur', 'too', 'fast', 'Selena', 'will', 'strike', 'vital', 'nerves', 'such', 'beautifully', 'acted', 'emotionally', 'taxing', 'film', 'Director', 'Gregory', 'Nava', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'employed', 'better', 'cast', 'display', 'characters', 'human', 'beings', 'not', 'pop-stars', 'are', 'Filled', 'experience', 'magic', 'growing', 'up', 'taking', 'flight', 'Selena', 'incisive', 'haunting', 'ability', 'move', 'audience', 'constant', 'highs', 'lows', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'convincing', 'mirror', 'image', 'Tejano', 'superstar']",N/A

The extended TV version of Selena restores deleted scenes such as Mexican school girls poking fun of Selena's inability to speak Spanish in the early 1980's.

The good thing about Selena is that it's a musical biopic that is actually about the music. At least 50% of the movie features musical performances, concerts, and recordings instead of spendning most of its time focused on Selena's murder and death.  The film highlights her career as an artist, which I think is an important thing to keep at the forefront. Furthermore, whether you like J.Lo or not, I think it's important to recognize that she did a great job portraying this rising Tejano singer. She wasn't even J.Lo yet when the movie was filmed, and I still only knew her as a fly girl from In Living Color.The movie Selena tells a great story--though a sad one.

The story of Selena Quintanilla Perez's (Lopez) rise to become Tejano's queen is so compelling that it can be viewed over and over again, as I did every time it was on cable or TV.  Certainly, the slant Gregory Nava took also contributed to the success of the movie.  The story begins not with Selena outright, but with her father, Abraham Quintanilla, who had musical dreams early on in his own life.  His band, &quot;Los Dinos&quot; fails before it gets a chance to start due to discrimination and prejudice. Flash forward several years, and Abraham has settled in Texas with his small family.  Almost by accident, he discovers his younger daughter, Selena (played by Becky Lee Meza) has real singing talent, and he resurrects the band with his children (after MANY hours of forced practice), christening them Selena y los Dinos. We then pick up with the family several years later touring on the road, and they are facing a new kind of prejudice- Selena is treading into &quot;man's&quot; territory, and Abraham is told she'll never make it in this business. They persevere, at the expense of never having known a normal lifestyle.  Soon Selena and her band hit number one, and things start to really take off for them. She even meets her future husband, Chris, played by Jon Seda.  The introduction of the infamous figure that would take her life, Yolanda Saldivar (Lupe Ontiveros), was so subtle and underplayed, that it did not detract from the story. Obviously, this production was handled with sincerity and is a loving tribute to the young woman cut down in her prime.  If she hasn't cast her spell over you yet, check this movie out, and she just might.

She is nothing short of sensational in this film. She is Selena!The film recounts the brief life of Selena Quintanilla Perez (Jennifer Lopez), a life that was built around her father's broken dreams. Her father (Edward James Olmos) had himself had a band in his youth called &quot;Los Dinos&quot;. Now a married man with children, his dreams have stalled along the wayside. When he realizes, however, that his young daughter has some musical talent, he builds a band around her, &quot;Selena and Los Dinos&quot;, and begins living vicariously through her.Under the watchful eye of her martinet father, years of forced, musical practices and life on the road follow. Loving, possessive, and controlling, he succeeds in almost losing her, when she marries her guitarist without her father's permission. They reconcile, however, and he places Selena on the path to stardom, a tejano sensation on the cusp of becoming a crossover musical star. Unfortunately, her path crosses that of a fan, Yolanda Saldivar, whom Selena befriends, only to have her be the one who cuts her down in her prime.Jennifer Lopez is sensational as Selena, big booty and all. She charms. She beguiles. She entertains. She is every inch the star. This has been her best role, and her performance is stellar. She should have won an award for her performance, because she most certainly deserved one for her portrayal of Selena. It is unfortunate that her acting career has been downhill ever since.Edward James Olmos is perfect as Abraham Quintanilla, the father who pushed his daughter to heights that he had dreamed for himself but had been unable to reach. His performance is powerful and rich. He, too, should have had his award calibre performance acknowledged in some way, as it was close to perfect.

I do agree that a bit more time should have been waited before making a movie about the doomed Tex-Mex singer. Selena was a talented artist and that feeling vibrates through-out the entire movie, especially with Jennifer Lopez's immpecable performance which is right up there with Val Kilmer in &quot;The Doors.&quot; However, sometimes we do feel as if this is really a shot at gaining some big bucks off Selena's image (but then again, isn't that the case with ALL products quickly released after a singer's death?). Yet the movie works, it is not an epic, grand piece, but it is still well-directed by Gregory Nava, who manages to capture the characters and their feelings in a believable way. Also, in the tradition of all singer movie bios, Nava also adds some mythic touches we know probably didn't take place, but for the sake of elevating our modern artists into rock god/goddess status, he puts them in (take that scene where she quiets a huge crowd by just raising a finger for example). Do we care about the dramatic license? Not really, since movies are fantasies in themselves. Back to Jennifer Lopez, she looks so much like the real thing that we never doubt for a moment that it is SELENA on screen, even with Lopez's current superstar status, we can still see this movie and think it is Selena doing things on screen and not Lopez. She also lip-syncs the songs perfectly and moves like the real person resurrected. All in all, it's not just a movie for tejano fans, it is a film anyone looking for a good time can enjoy. It is a sweet package about fame, singing and falling in love. The songs are pretty good too. It's a fun movie all around and I really can't think of anyone making another movie about Selena.

Prior to becoming an international sensation, Selena was a homegirl from Corpus Christi, Texas.The 'perfect' looks of everybody give this an icky TV movie feeling, also ignoring the fact that it was a big screen release. Physical imperfections would have brought the characters closer to their real life counterparts and perhaps given this film it's greater due.They were ordinary people who touched the world in extrordinary ways.I also would have loved to see more of Selena's singing. I consider it an irony that a movie about a singer (staring a person who would largely launch her own singing career from this same title) had so little of her performances.Finally, it seemed odd this film would want to skip over the arrest and apprehension of Selena's killer Yolanda Saldivar. Since there was so grand conspiracy ala JFK, viewers who do not neccessarily know what happened (or have honestly forgotten details since there was perpetrator confirmation from the moment which Selena had been murdered) are left hanging at this film's end.

I also give huge props to the Young Selena (Rebecca Lee Meza). The film had me in tears at the end and the storyline was sentimental and sweet, not trashy. A very well-produced, great movie! I don't care if people though that because Jennifer Lopez was Puerto Rican, she shouldn't have been playing a person of Mexican lineage, but she did a wonderful job to bring Selena's music and spirit back to life!

It made Selena one too, or should I say, a star in a wider arena. Most of the mainstream population had never heard of Selena, myself included. When I first saw this movie, I had no idea how it would end, and was shocked by the tragic conclusion, and deeply saddened.Today, this is still a movie I enjoy. Any underdog story is inspiring, and Selena was an underdog, alright. The odds were against her ever making it big, (that's showbiz) but not only did she, but with flair.Lopez not only plays Selena, she BECOMES Selena. I'm no J.Lo fan, but she absolutely blows me away in this film. Anybody who can critize Lopez's performance in this film is either impossible to please, or still bitter that a Puerto Rican played a famous Mexican American. From the footage of Selena I've seen, Lopez nailed it, and that should mean more than pedigree.There is no bad acting in this film. Perhaps the weakest link would be Jon Seda, who plays Chris, Selena's husband. But that's not to say he does a bad job. He convinces me he loves Selena, and that he can play the guitar. Not much else is needed, even if he doesn't dazzle with his skills. He's there to support a part of the story, so why expect Oscar worthy?Still, however much I enjoy the film, I can't escape the feeling that I'm not getting the entire truth, that I'm getting a censored, whitewashed version of events. But what can one expect? This movie was released just two years after Selena got shot, and nobody was ready to see a gritty, raw version of the singer's life. It was also produced by her father, for crying out loud. This movie was for Selena's fans, and to get her story and music out there. It certainly accomplished that. Still, it would be interesting to see an unathorized version of Selena's life, made by somebody totally objective, see how it holds up.",4,Surgarcoaded? Probably. Effectively Powerful?
