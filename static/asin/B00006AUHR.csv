710256,A1YCV76MUFESR1,B00006AUHR,Anne-Marie G,"[4, 5]","This movie is very different from any of the other muppet movies I have seen to date, for a number of reasons.  Firstly, the muppets had the brilliance to appeal to children and adults at the same time--this movie focuses solely on the first group.  There is little of the witty rapport between the characters that really makes the muppets have their zing.  Its on level with ""Bear in the Big Blue House"" except it lacks the sweetness of that show as well, its straddling some middle line with humour that its quite un-muppet like (the mooning--which will probably get laughs from the right audience, but it seems demeening and below what muppets should do) very juvenile.  The plot is only so-so.  the songs, none of them really stand out except for the Me First and the Gimme Gimmes cover of the Rainbow connection, which wasn't even original to the movie.What I did enjoy were many of the new characters introduced.  Croaker and Goggles are very enjoyable in terms of muppet aesthetics, they really fit in, but in new ways.  Blotch is a fun character but I didn't enjoy is character design as much he seemed a little too stiff in the body, the facial close ups though really highlighted the innovantions they have made with allowing the puppeteers more control of over the face--such as the eyes and the eyelids.  Pilgrim--eeeeh, the puppet design was sort of weak I though, she looked too much like a puppet trying to look real, they should have gone one way or the other.I did not enjoy the disection scene (uh didn't we already go there in ET? maybe they should have found a way to pay homage to that)  Originally when the Mister Doctor guy was collecting frogs I was thinking Steinbeck's character Doc in Cannery Row (which is similar but not quite what they had).There are enjoyable little homages to Henson in the film (""Let me give you a hand"") and if you watch the movie with the selected audio commentary on kermit points these things out--but the commentary is kinda boring really.  The bloopers are kinda funny--they are the best extra feature followed by the behind the scenes footage with Joe the Armadillo.",3,Ehh..definately lacks a certain charm,1167782400,"01 3, 2007",2007,2123,"['movie', 'very', 'different', 'other', 'muppet', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'date', 'number', 'reasons', 'Firstly', 'muppets', 'had', 'brilliance', 'appeal', 'children', 'adults', 'same', 'time', 'movie', 'solely', 'first', 'group', 'little', 'witty', 'rapport', 'characters', 'really', 'muppets', 'have', 'zing', 'level', 'Bear', 'Big', 'Blue', 'House', 'sweetness', 'show', 'as', 'well', 'straddling', 'middle', 'line', 'humour', 'quite', 'un-muppet', 'mooning', 'will', 'probably', 'get', 'laughs', 'right', 'audience', 'demeening', 'what', 'muppets', 'should', 'do', 'very', 'juvenile', 'plot', 'only', 'so-so', 'songs', 'none', 'really', 'stand', 'out', 'Me', 'First', 'Gim', 'Gimmes', 'cover', 'Rainbow', 'connection', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'original', 'movie.What', 'did', 'enjoy', 'were', 'many', 'new', 'characters', 'introduced', 'Croaker', 'Goggles', 'are', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'terms', 'muppet', 'aesthetics', 'really', 'fit', 'new', 'ways', 'Blotch', 'fun', 'character', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'character', 'design', 'as', 'much', 'seemed', 'little', 'too', 'stiff', 'body', 'facial', 'close', 'ups', 'really', 'highlighted', 'innovantions', 'have', 'made', 'allowing', 'puppeteers', 'more', 'control', 'face', 'such', 'eyes', 'eyelids', 'Pilgrim', 'eeeeh', 'puppet', 'design', 'was', 'sort', 'weak', 'looked', 'too', 'much', 'puppet', 'trying', 'look', 'real', 'should', 'have', 'gone', 'one', 'way', 'other.I', 'did', 'not', 'enjoy', 'disection', 'scene', 'uh', 'did', ""n't"", 'already', 'go', 'there', 'ET', 'maybe', 'should', 'have', 'found', 'way', 'pay', 'homage', 'Originally', 'when', 'Mister', 'Doctor', 'guy', 'was', 'collecting', 'frogs', 'was', 'thinking', 'Steinbeck', 'character', 'Doc', 'Cannery', 'Row', 'similar', 'not', 'quite', 'what', 'had', 'are', 'enjoyable', 'little', 'homages', 'Henson', 'film', 'Let', 'give', 'hand', 'watch', 'movie', 'selected', 'audio', 'commentary', 'kermit', 'points', 'things', 'out', 'commentary', 'kinda', 'boring', 'really', 'bloopers', 'are', 'kinda', 'funny', 'are', 'best', 'extra', 'feature', 'followed', 'scenes', 'footage', 'Joe', 'Armadillo']",Kermit's Swamp Years

Willemsen,"[8, 11]","As with most things Muppets this can be taken on many levels with lots of gags aimed primarily at adults while still being very entertaining for the little ones. It has rapidly become one of my 18 month old's favorite movies to watch and gives us a welcome break from Elmo/Sesame Street. The outtakes at the end of the movie and in the special features also give some &quot;behind the scenes&quot; insight into what goes into a muppet production. Pilgrim the dog is also the most lifelike yet expressive muppet I have ever seen.In many ways this movie is a muppets &quot;Stand by me&quot;, a coming of age movie for Kermit and his buddies that isn't always pretty. If you are easily offended stay away, but otherwise step back and enjoy this little romp that gives us some insight into why Kermit became the frog he is today...To respond to the other posters who object to the &quot;violence&quot;, it has to be said that the bully bullfrog ultimately learns the value of friendship, helping others and self-sacrifice. Most kids will meet real life bullies soone enough, and I hope they can learn something from how these frogs deal with that situation.
