1387759,A2D7B5I7ZQ51XL,B0046JLTLA,Anthony Pittore,"[0, 0]","'Gun,' which was written by Curtis '50 Cent' Jackson and directed by the guy who did 'Soul Plane' (need I say more?), tells the story the city of Detroit's crackdown on a gun-running organization run by the criminal Rich (Fitty Cent). Rich then teams up with his friend Angel (Val Kilmer) to expand business. This leads to even more problems beyond his business. . .First things first, most people will be drawn to this film based on the supporting cast. While Val Kilmer is on a serious run of crap movies (joining the ranks of formerly talented stars like Cuba Gooding, Jr.), he still maintains at least a mild following, even if his last solid flick was 'D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu' a half-decade ago (okay, 'Felon' was also pretty good, so I'll let that pass as well). Alongside Kilmer, 'Gun' also includes a few other well known actors like John Larroquette, James Remar, & Danny Trejo (though Remar is the only one of the bunch who is featured enough throughout). Regardless of the reasonably notable cast, 'Gun' doesn't have a lot to offer. Now, it's not the total disaster that one would expect from the writer/director combination. Keep in mind, 50 Cent grew up in a life of crime with a teenage coke dealer for a mother (who was murdered when 50 was only twelve), and his own time as a dealer in both guns & drugs before he became a rapper. Therefore, he's pretty well versed in street crime, so he knows how to set up a realistic story about it. Unfortunately, even though the story does have the gritty realism of the Detroit crime world. . . it's just not implemented well by director Jessy Terrero at all. Not to mention that the overall story is completely overdone and the ""twists"" are anything but shocking from the early parts of the film. This makes for a bit of a lag in the thrills of the crime, and a total lack of surprise by the end.Overall, the film isn't a complete & utter disaster. The story is interesting enough to maintain interest, but the director's failure to fully exploit the dark themes forced the film to fail. To be honest, a story chronicling 50 Cent's ridiculous life story seems like it'd be a hell of a lot more interesting than any of the movies he stars in.Final Verdict: 5/10.-AP3-",2,"Not the worst, but still not worth the time.",1298419200,"02 23, 2011",2011,2222,"[""'Gun"", 'was', 'written', 'Curtis', 'Cent', 'Jackson', 'directed', 'guy', 'who', 'did', ""'Soul"", 'Plane', 'say', 'more', 'story', 'city', 'Detroit', 'crackdown', 'gun-running', 'organization', 'run', 'criminal', 'Rich', 'Fitty', 'Cent', 'Rich', 'then', 'up', 'friend', 'Angel', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'expand', 'business', 'even', 'more', 'problems', 'business', '.First', 'things', 'first', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'drawn', 'film', 'based', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'serious', 'run', 'crap', 'movies', 'joining', 'ranks', 'formerly', 'talented', 'stars', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'still', 'least', 'mild', 'following', 'even', 'last', 'solid', 'flick', 'was', ""'D"", 'eacute', 'agrave', 'Vu', 'half-decade', 'ago', 'okay', 'was', 'also', 'pretty', 'good', ""'ll"", 'let', 'pass', 'as', 'well', 'Alongside', 'Kilmer', ""'Gun"", 'also', 'few', 'other', 'well', 'known', 'actors', 'John', 'Larroquette', 'James', 'Remar', 'Danny', 'Trejo', 'Remar', 'only', 'one', 'bunch', 'who', 'featured', 'enough', 'Regardless', 'reasonably', 'notable', 'cast', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'offer', 'Now', 'not', 'total', 'disaster', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'writer/director', 'combination', 'Keep', 'mind', '50', 'Cent', 'grew', 'up', 'life', 'crime', 'teenage', 'coke', 'dealer', 'mother', 'who', 'was', 'murdered', 'when', '50', 'was', 'only', 'twelve', 'own', 'time', 'dealer', 'guns', 'drugs', 'became', 'rapper', 'Therefore', 'pretty', 'well', 'versed', 'street', 'crime', 'how', 'set', 'up', 'realistic', 'story', 'Unfortunately', 'even', 'story', 'have', 'gritty', 'realism', 'Detroit', 'crime', 'world', 'just', 'not', 'implemented', 'well', 'director', 'Jessy', 'Terrero', 'Not', 'mention', 'overall', 'story', 'completely', 'overdone', 'twists', 'are', 'anything', 'shocking', 'early', 'parts', 'film', 'bit', 'lag', 'thrills', 'crime', 'total', 'lack', 'surprise', 'end.Overall', 'film', ""n't"", 'complete', 'utter', 'disaster', 'story', 'interesting', 'enough', 'maintain', 'interest', 'director', 'failure', 'fully', 'exploit', 'dark', 'themes', 'forced', 'film', 'fail', 'be', 'honest', 'story', 'chronicling', '50', 'Cent', 'ridiculous', 'life', 'story', ""'d"", 'be', 'hell', 'lot', 'more', 'interesting', 'movies', 'in.Final', 'Verdict', '5/10.-AP3-']",Gun

1387762,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B0046JLTLA,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[0, 0]","From the director of ""Soul Plane"" Jessy Terrero and the hip hop star Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson comes ""GUN"", a 2010 independent film which showcases 50 Cent not only as an actor but the main screenwriter for the film.VIDEO:""GUN"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (Widescreen 2:35:1).  I wish there was special features included because the picture quality has this look of overcast (it was shot during the Winter time) and looks a bit desaturated at times.  But for the most part, it fits with the film.  Black levels are deep, I didn't see any artifacting or banding.  But overall, if the desaturated look was intended by cinematographer Zeus Morand, then I can say that ""GUN"" looks good on Blu-ray.Considering this is a low-budget film, ""GUN"" looks good on Blu-ray.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""GUN"" sports an English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 soundtrack.  While the majority of the film is dialogue and music-driven through the center, front and even surround channels, possibly the best part is how the gun battles were used.  Although the film is not action-driven throughout the film, there are scenes were rifle shots, gun shots come out with excellent clarity.  Even scenes where Fifty Cent keeps hitting a man between legs with a baseball bat, the crunching sounds and the visual of that scene literally makes you cringe.Subtitles are presented in English SDH and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""GUN"" does not come with any special features.JUDGMENT CALL:Hip hop star 50 Cent makes his debut as a screenwriter for his latest film ""GUN"", which he produced and stars in.  While his heart was in the right place in capturing arms deals, this low-budget film is hampered by plot holes, utilization of characters and overall execution.  Otherwise, if you are a fan of Fifty Cent, Val Kilmer or the stars in this film, give it a chance.But with a film shot under $3 million, it was an ambitious film and there's only so much you can do.In an interview for ""GUN"", Fifty Cent said. ""Initially when I started the plot, it was a socially conscious story about how guns go from the manufacturing point to retail and purchased by law-abiding citizens and how they fall into the wrong hands. And what made it interesting and so relevant...was the fact that companies like Smith & Wesson are up 125 percent in sales in the middle of a recession.""For gun enthusiasts, I'll give 50 Cent credit because he knows the streets, he knows how things are done.  But the problem lies in execution.  The Detroit police department are shown as weak, that the mayor is so impatient that he brings two members of the ATF to shake things up and get things done.While the police are complaining that they don't have anything on Rich, the things that comes out of Detective Rogers' (played by James Remar) lips are unbelievable and once again, he and his force look so weak, you just feel sorry for them as they seem like a small town police force trying to take down big city players.I felt that Fifty Cent at least did a good job playing Rich but the others...  Val Kilmer was good but somehow when we start to learn more about him, that cool and collected man suddenly changes to become something less.  I don't know how to explain it but he goes from a man that can easily put a bullet in someones head to later become a man who starts to whimper.  But I think the biggest thing that will shock people about ""GUN"" is seeing the once sexy Val Kilmer that people remember from ""Top Gun"", ""Willow"", ""Heat"" or ""Batman Forever"" having changed a lot physically since those films and has gained a lot of weight and unfortunately, his acting is all over the place for this film.  I have seen better acting from Val Kilmer and this film was not one of them.Both actors Danny Trejo (""Machete"", ""xXx""), LaLa Vasquez (""You Got Served""), John Larroquette (""Night Court"", ""Boston Legal"") are limited to short roles and unfortunately, we barely see Danny Trejo doing anything major shooting, LaLa Vasquez is just a person who works at a restaurant and John Larroquette plays the man who is supplying the weaponry is only shown at the end and unfortunately, because of that, there is no major impact to the end of the film.The film also stars ""90210' sexy vixen AnnaLynne McCord who plays Rich's girlfriend and the go-between between Rich and the weaponry suppliers.  Although she can do sex scenes with 50 Cent, her character as the go-between for weaponry, just didn't seem right.This week I had a chance to review T.I.'s ""Takers"" and now Fifty Cent's ""GUN"".  Two hip hop stars trying to make it big in live action films as a producer and an actor and one thing that T.I. did right with his film is align himself with people to make sure the writing is top notch.  For ""GUN"", I wonder if anyone even gave Fifty Cent constructive criticism to make some changes to the screenplay.  I felt that Fifty Cent's heart was in the right place for the screenplay, but the overall execution was hurt by bad acting, storyline structure and a lackluster Blu-ray release.This Blu-ray release should have had some form of special features which sometimes helps enhance our movie watching experience, may it be a commentary or making of, this would have been a great film for Fifty Cent to talk about the screenwriting process and such.  But nothing was included.During the screening of the film back in December (and reported on the The Grand Rapids Press), Fifty Cent told the audience before the film, ""I'm a work in progress.  I'll be better tomorrow than I am today.""""GUN"" is one of the three films that 50 Cent has written and I just hope that by the second film, what he learned from the making of this film as a producer, writer and actor shows improvement for his next film.  We all live and learn from our experiences and although ""GUN"" is not a good film, nor is it a good Blu-ray release, I look forward to see how he improves in the future.",2,"Blu-ray: 50 Cent takes on the role of screenwriter/actor for ""GUN"".

This was wrote by 50 Cent & unfortantly stars him this is when I knew this  wasgoing to have a lot of problems but it is watchable it is worth a watch 50 plays some kind of arms dealer named Rich, Val Kilmer plays Angel & James Remar as Detective Rogers. You start off with this arms dealer Rich & crewshoot up a Night Club. Then you have this guy named Angel has gotten out of prison & he's friends with Rich. Yeah I'm really buying that Val Kilmer is good in the hood & he's friends with 50 Cent. You also have this guy named Detective Rogers he's investigating Rich which if they would've focused more on James Remar I think it could've been a little better. 50 goes on & on about his revolver. Danny Trejo is killed in a gun deal that goes bad which was good after Machete he deserved it. You learn why Angel was released is that he agreed to help Rogers capture Rich cause that Night Club that Rich & his crew shot up Angel's wife was 1 of the victims. The funniest part is when 50 tells a story when they were little some dude bullied 1 of his friends & he took a black & white TV & smashed it over that bullies head I know it was suppose to funny but I'm not laughing with 50. Ok it ends Angel helps the cops bust Rich & his gang we have a big shoot out with the cops Angel confonts Rich he shot Rich & he goes to jail Angle reunites with his daughter & this movie was pretty sub par. I know it was a bad explaination of the plot but but it's not a good movie. If you had somebody like Wesley Snipes or Micheal Jai White it may have been better cause 50 Cent can't act. Really he can only play 1 character I know somebody will tell me that Jean Claude Van Damme does too I call BS on that cause he played Frank Dux in Bloodsport he played Kurt Sloane in Kickboxer Luc Deverux in  Universal Soldier Max Walker in Timecop a serial killer & a clone in the same movie Replicant  Kyle LeBlanc in, In Hell & Ben Archer in Wake Of Death those are 7 completly different characters played way diffent.

1387765,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B0046JLTLA,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","I've not watched the numerous films that rap artists Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson has made to date. As a matter of fact I think TWELVE was actually the first thing I'd seen him in. With the number of rap stars crossing over into films it never seems like they stretch much, almost always portraying thugs or drug dealers and the like. On rate occasion a few have made memorable performances but, like rap music, those that make a lasting impression are few and far between.The same can't be said of Jackson. Sure, his characters might be street wise but there is more depth to them than can be found in most exploitation films. And this film, while the slim plot might make one think it qualifies for that genre, is actually better than one would expect.Jackson stars as Rich, a young street punk who's out to make a name for himself in the world of gun running. The film opens with Rich and his crew tricking his competition into running from a club only to be caught in a hail of bullets. With this group gone, Rich is now the top dog in the world of gun running in Detroit.Moving forward we get to see Angel (Val Kilmer) released from prison. His story is yet unclear to us, but he moves into a room and soon finds his way to Rich. The two have a history where Angel once saved Rich from certain death. He asks Rich for a gun which he is more than happy to provide. A few days later he returns to take Rich up on an offer to join his crew.As these two stories merge a third part of the puzzle appears in the persona of Detective Rogers (James Remar), a veteran cop on the force who has made his single most important goal to shut down the gun runners in his town. Saddled with a pair of hot shot ATF agents who seem more intent on ridiculing him than in helping, Rogers trudges along following the leads which eventually take him to Rich.As the film moves along we discover that Rich has made a connection with a powerful organization that can supply him with more guns than he could ever imagine. His connection is a beautiful woman named Gabriella (AnnaLynee McCord) who seems as interested in bedding down Rich as she does in establishing him with her bosses.While each of these items comes together there is still something missing, some piece that we are yet unaware of that connects them all together. And this missing piece is the one part of this film that makes it rise above the common street thug films that usually arrive straight to DVD. I won't spoil it and some of you may figure it out long before the final reel, but it does offer something that for many will be unexpected.The film was written by Jackson, another plus that makes it a bit more ambitious than most. He does a good job here providing realistic characters that might on occasion fall back on the usual stereotypes but for the most part seem true to the story. The dialogue doesn't rank with that of say Kevin Smith, but it flows naturally and is delivered by a cast that treats it like Shakespeare rather than a dime store direct to DVD feature.I doubt that this film will come close to Oscar consideration but it does offer a solid story, entertainment for fans of the genre and some good performances. Kilmer, an actor who started strong and lately has become a staple of direct to DVD films, always turns in a performance that exceeds the material he is given. Who knows why Hollywood has seemed to shun him when it comes to major studio releases? Whatever the reason, he raises the quality of the films he stars in. And this is one that rises to meet his achievement on its own merits.",3,GUN: OFFERS A FULL CLIP,1295222400,"01 17, 2011",2011,3570,"[""'ve"", 'not', 'watched', 'numerous', 'films', 'rap', 'Curtis', '50', 'Cent', 'Jackson', 'made', 'date', 'matter', 'fact', 'think', 'TWELVE', 'was', 'actually', 'first', 'thing', ""'d"", 'seen', 'number', 'rap', 'stars', 'crossing', 'films', 'never', 'stretch', 'much', 'almost', 'always', 'portraying', 'thugs', 'drug', 'dealers', 'like', 'rate', 'occasion', 'few', 'have', 'made', 'memorable', 'performances', 'rap', 'music', 'make', 'lasting', 'impression', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'between.The', 'same', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'said', 'Jackson', 'Sure', 'characters', 'might', 'be', 'street', 'wise', 'more', 'depth', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'most', 'exploitation', 'films', 'film', 'slim', 'plot', 'might', 'make', 'one', 'think', 'genre', 'actually', 'better', 'one', 'would', 'expect.Jackson', 'stars', 'Rich', 'young', 'street', 'punk', 'who', 'out', 'make', 'name', 'world', 'gun', 'running', 'film', 'Rich', 'crew', 'tricking', 'competition', 'running', 'club', 'only', 'be', 'caught', 'hail', 'bullets', 'group', 'gone', 'Rich', 'now', 'top', 'dog', 'world', 'gun', 'running', 'Detroit.Moving', 'forward', 'get', 'see', 'Angel', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'released', 'prison', 'story', 'yet', 'unclear', 'room', 'soon', 'way', 'Rich', 'two', 'have', 'history', 'where', 'Angel', 'once', 'saved', 'Rich', 'certain', 'death', 'Rich', 'gun', 'more', 'happy', 'provide', 'few', 'days', 'later', 'take', 'Rich', 'up', 'offer', 'join', 'crew.As', 'two', 'stories', 'merge', 'third', 'part', 'puzzle', 'persona', 'Detective', 'Rogers', 'James', 'Remar', 'veteran', 'cop', 'force', 'who', 'made', 'single', 'most', 'important', 'goal', 'shut', 'down', 'gun', 'runners', 'town', 'Saddled', 'pair', 'hot', 'shot', 'ATF', 'agents', 'who', 'seem', 'more', 'intent', 'ridiculing', 'helping', 'Rogers', 'following', 'leads', 'eventually', 'take', 'Rich.As', 'film', 'moves', 'discover', 'Rich', 'made', 'connection', 'powerful', 'organization', 'can', 'supply', 'more', 'guns', 'could', 'ever', 'imagine', 'connection', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'named', 'Gabriella', 'AnnaLynee', 'McCord', 'who', 'as', 'interested', 'bedding', 'down', 'Rich', 'establishing', 'bosses.While', 'items', 'together', 'still', 'something', 'missing', 'piece', 'are', 'yet', 'unaware', 'together', 'missing', 'piece', 'one', 'part', 'film', 'rise', 'common', 'street', 'thug', 'films', 'usually', 'arrive', 'straight', 'DVD', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'may', 'figure', 'out', 'long', 'final', 'reel', 'offer', 'something', 'many', 'will', 'be', 'unexpected.The', 'film', 'was', 'written', 'Jackson', 'bit', 'more', 'ambitious', 'most', 'good', 'job', 'here', 'providing', 'realistic', 'characters', 'might', 'occasion', 'fall', 'back', 'usual', 'stereotypes', 'most', 'part', 'seem', 'true', 'story', 'dialogue', ""n't"", 'rank', 'say', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'naturally', 'delivered', 'cast', 'Shakespeare', 'rather', 'dime', 'store', 'direct', 'DVD', 'feature.I', 'doubt', 'film', 'will', 'come', 'close', 'Oscar', 'consideration', 'offer', 'solid', 'story', 'entertainment', 'fans', 'genre', 'good', 'performances', 'Kilmer', 'actor', 'who', 'started', 'strong', 'lately', 'become', 'staple', 'direct', 'DVD', 'films', 'always', 'performance', 'material', 'given', 'Who', 'why', 'Hollywood', 'seemed', 'shun', 'when', 'major', 'studio', 'releases', 'reason', 'quality', 'films', 'one', 'meet', 'achievement', 'own', 'merits']",Gun

In the first scene there is a strip joint with pole dancers who keep their clothes on. A hit is done outside the joint as Jackson kills his competition in the drug trade. The Mexican Cartels need lots of high powered guns, which Jackson claims he will provide. His connection is the pretty Annalynne McCord who also has sex with Jackson, the author of the script. Meanwhile Val Kilmer is being released from prison and goes to work for Jackson, a man who he once saved in a street shoot out. Danny Trejo is on the screen for about 3 minutes, nothing to write home about.The cops along with their rival, the ATF are after the gun dealers. Their role was done rather poorly while the thugs was done well, a reflection of what 50 cents really knows well. Hip-hop background music, no surprise.

Rich (Jackson) and Angel (Kilmer) are crime partners involved with the distribution of arms.  Overall better then I expected it to be, (50 Cent wrote it).  We find out pretty early that Rich is the one with the revolver and from then on it gets pretty predictable.  For the type of movie it is, I will give it a 6 out of 10, but don't let that deceive you, it's better then Streets of Blood (the last Jackson and Kilmer movie) but thats not saying a whole lot.  If you are looking for a top notch, exciting action flic I'd go with A-Team over this one.  I will say that this is Kilmer's best movie in awhile, which again isn't saying a whole lot.
