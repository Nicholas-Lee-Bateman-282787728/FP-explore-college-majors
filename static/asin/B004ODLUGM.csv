1422976,A1KONL8ECYFG37,B004ODLUGM,DVD Verdict,"[2, 4]","Judge Clark Douglas, DVD Verdict-- The Gruffalo isn't a particularly ambitious animated short nor a remarkably inventive one, but it's a perfectly charming little tale that should keep the youngsters spellbound. Older viewers will be two steps ahead of the game from the beginning (and I imagine that even the young kids will have figured out the final twist by the time it arrives), but this is a sturdy example of how to bring a children's storybook to life. The story is classical in style and stays free from the pop-culture snark that runs through so much children's entertainment these days (if this were a Dreamworks flick, you know the word ""Gruffalo"" would be rhymed with ""Mark Ruffalo"" at some point). The animation is low-budget but distinctively designed, which is more or less essential if you don't have the funds to dazzle with technical polish. The voice work from the very overqualified cast (most characters only have a small handful of lines) is exceptional, and the music by Rene Aubry has an appealingly breezy quality.There's not much else to say about this 27-minute short (which moves at such a laid-back pace that it somehow feels even shorter), save for the fact that it probably deserved its Oscar nomination but also deserved to lose the win to The Lost Thing.I do wish that The Gruffalo could have been paired with something else to pad the running time of the disc, but the transfer is very handsome, boasting vibrant colors and excellent detail. Audio is top-notch too, with the pleasant score and sonorous vocal work coming through with clarity. Extras include a 13-minute making-of featurette and some storyboards.-Full review at dvdverdict.com",4,Deserved its Oscar nomination,1311552000,"07 25, 2011",2011,1677,"['Judge', 'Clark', 'Douglas', 'DVD', 'Verdict', 'Gruffalo', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'ambitious', 'animated', 'short', 'remarkably', 'inventive', 'one', 'perfectly', 'charming', 'little', 'tale', 'should', 'keep', 'youngsters', 'spellbound', 'Older', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'two', 'steps', 'ahead', 'game', 'beginning', 'imagine', 'even', 'young', 'kids', 'will', 'have', 'figured', 'out', 'final', 'twist', 'time', 'sturdy', 'example', 'how', 'bring', 'children', 'storybook', 'life', 'story', 'classical', 'style', 'stays', 'free', 'pop-culture', 'snark', 'so', 'much', 'children', 'entertainment', 'days', 'were', 'Dreamworks', 'flick', 'know', 'word', 'Gruffalo', 'would', 'be', 'rhymed', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'point', 'animation', 'low-budget', 'distinctively', 'designed', 'more', 'less', 'essential', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'funds', 'dazzle', 'technical', 'polish', 'voice', 'work', 'very', 'overqualified', 'cast', 'most', 'characters', 'only', 'have', 'small', 'handful', 'lines', 'exceptional', 'music', 'Rene', 'Aubry', 'appealingly', 'breezy', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'say', '27-minute', 'short', 'such', 'laid-back', 'pace', 'somehow', 'feels', 'even', 'shorter', 'save', 'fact', 'probably', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'also', 'deserved', 'lose', 'win', 'Lost', 'Thing.I', 'do', 'wish', 'Gruffalo', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'paired', 'something', 'else', 'pad', 'running', 'time', 'disc', 'transfer', 'very', 'handsome', 'boasting', 'vibrant', 'colors', 'excellent', 'detail', 'Audio', 'top-notch', 'too', 'pleasant', 'score', 'sonorous', 'vocal', 'work', 'coming', 'clarity', 'Extras', 'include', '13-minute', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'storyboards.-Full', 'review', 'dvdverdict.com']",The Gruffalo

I borrowed it from our local library because my two older kids love the book.I am pushing 40, and was drawn into the absolutely fantastic production values put into this short children's film.  Already knowing the story inside out (hey, reading it every night for weeks on end, it's almost memorized now), I was pleasantly surprised how many added details these filmakers were able to put into this DVD.On top of this, there is a wonderful behind-the-scenes featurette on the DVD showing all the work that went into making this film.  And not only did the filmmakers put their all into this show, they managed to bring in top notch actors to voice the main characters.  I mean, having Helena Bonham Carter, Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid from Harry Potter movies) and John Hurt (the poor man who found out how Aliens are born) working on this shows just how seriously everyone took the project.Beautifully rendered in CGI computer graphics, the main characters actually inhabit a real-life created world; that's right, the background soil, trees, rocks etc. were all made in miniature, including meticulously made leaves and twigs.  Amazing.This goes to show how a labour of love can be realized with the right people helping you out.And the music!  Full orchestra soundtrack - not just a synthesizer.And all wrapped up in a 34 minute show.Incredible.  Well worth the price, despite being a short film.

The books allow him to page through at his own pace and go back and forth and search out the details in the illustrations.",5,very nice movie for young children,1365724800,"04 12, 2013",2013,703,"['4-year', 'old', 'Grandson', 'had', 'seen', 'movie', '34', 'Gruffalo', 'child', '34', 'loved', 'so', 'much', 'went', 'looking', 'book', 'other', 'video', 'series', 'found', '34', 'Gruffalo', '34', '34', 'Gruffalo', 'Child', '34', 'book', 'form', 'Video', 'purchased', 'formats', 'books', 'short', 'little', 'videos', 'amazing', 'how', 'well', '4-year', 'old', 'child', 'understood', 'twist', 'story', 'video', 'out', 'big', 'belly', 'time', 'mouse', 'other', 'creatures', 'forest', 'highly', 'recommend', 'series', 'books', 'allow', 'page', 'own', 'pace', 'go', 'back', 'forth', 'search', 'out', 'details', 'illustrations']",The Gruffalo
