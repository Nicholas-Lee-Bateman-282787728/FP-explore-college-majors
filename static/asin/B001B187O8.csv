1169920,A1N528QZ6Z32I8,B001B187O8,"Amazon Customer ""Webhead""","[0, 0]","I had never heard of these books or videos before. i'm the father of a 6 year old girl and we're very protective of what we expose her to on tv. A lot of what we watch is PBS, etc. It was by pure chance that I happened to catch a part of one of these shows live on TV while I was channel surging. Granted, this is a kids show, but it captured MY (the adult) attention right away and I finished watching the show. In fact, I recorded it. Showed it to my daughter a couple days later and she wanted to know if there were any more. Instant hit. I showed it to my wife and she loved it too. This is a rare find people. A wholesome show about a brother and sister who actually get along. The brother shows more patience and kindness to his sister than probably any real brother would his real sister. But it's still really nice, when we're accustomed to watching shows about how DYSFUNCTIONAL families can be in the name of entertainment and comedy, to be able to watch a brother helping his sister, teaching her, taking care of her. And the innocent whimsy and imagination of the sister is really what drives the show. The show tackles topics that are super relevant to ANY kid... fear of failing, how to share, being scared to be away from your parents, losing a tooth, being a picky eater, being scared of things at night, being a good listener, etc. There are at least 3 more volumes that are out there (volumes 9-11) that are not part of this set, but there's no easier, nicer, or better way to get volumes 1-8 all at once. If you have never seen this show, try it right away, you won't be disappointed. And if you have seen the show and you're looking for an easy way to fill out your collection, this is it, look no further. I went ahead and bought volumes 9-11 individually because there's no set for them yet, and those are good too. As always, there's no substitute for parental supervision, even with a show like this. If there are topics you prefer your kids not watch (ie, halloween, death of a pet, etc) then you should bypass those. But every topic is handled carefully and in a kid friendly and wholesome way.",5,what rock was i hiding under?,1394668800,"03 13, 2014",2014,2120,"['had', 'never', 'heard', 'books', 'videos', 'i', ""'m"", 'father', '6', 'year', 'old', 'girl', ""'re"", 'very', 'protective', 'what', 'expose', 'tv', 'lot', 'what', 'watch', 'PBS', 'etc', 'was', 'pure', 'chance', 'happened', 'catch', 'part', 'one', 'shows', 'live', 'TV', 'was', 'channel', 'surging', 'Granted', 'kids', 'show', 'captured', 'MY', 'adult', 'attention', 'right', 'away', 'finished', 'watching', 'show', 'fact', 'recorded', 'Showed', 'daughter', 'couple', 'days', 'later', 'wanted', 'know', 'were', 'more', 'Instant', 'hit', 'showed', 'wife', 'loved', 'too', 'rare', 'find', 'people', 'wholesome', 'show', 'brother', 'sister', 'who', 'actually', 'get', 'brother', 'more', 'patience', 'kindness', 'sister', 'probably', 'real', 'brother', 'would', 'real', 'sister', 'still', 'really', 'nice', 'when', ""'re"", 'accustomed', 'watching', 'shows', 'how', 'DYSFUNCTIONAL', 'families', 'can', 'be', 'name', 'entertainment', 'comedy', 'be', 'able', 'watch', 'brother', 'helping', 'sister', 'teaching', 'taking', 'care', 'innocent', 'whimsy', 'imagination', 'sister', 'really', 'what', 'show', 'show', 'topics', 'are', 'super', 'relevant', 'ANY', 'kid', 'fear', 'failing', 'how', 'share', 'being', 'scared', 'be', 'away', 'parents', 'losing', 'tooth', 'being', 'picky', 'eater', 'being', 'scared', 'things', 'night', 'being', 'good', 'listener', 'etc', 'are', 'least', '3', 'more', 'volumes', 'are', 'there', 'volumes', '9-11', 'are', 'not', 'part', 'set', 'easier', 'nicer', 'better', 'way', 'get', 'volumes', '1-8', 'once', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'show', 'try', 'right', 'away', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'have', 'seen', 'show', ""'re"", 'looking', 'easy', 'way', 'fill', 'out', 'collection', 'look', 'further', 'went', 'ahead', 'bought', 'volumes', '9-11', 'individually', 'set', 'yet', 'are', 'good', 'too', 'always', 'substitute', 'parental', 'supervision', 'even', 'show', 'are', 'topics', 'prefer', 'kids', 'not', 'watch', 'ie', 'halloween', 'death', 'pet', 'etc', 'then', 'should', 'bypass', 'topic', 'handled', 'carefully', 'kid', 'friendly', 'wholesome', 'way']",Charlie & Lola: The Absolutely Completely Complete Seasons One and Two

Well they spent the rest of the week watching them, again and again. They are very educational and very tricky in how they add the education in there. They are there to help children understand morals although they are not preachy. Some have a point, some are just for fun, and that makes them perfect.Charlie and Lola are highly recommended for your children, or even the child in you because they are that enjoyable.But Charlie!!!",5,But Charlie...,1325635200,"01 4, 2012",2012,547,"['got', 'kiddo', 'watching', 'Disney', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'came', 'DVD', 'just', 'had', 'get', 'Well', 'spent', 'rest', 'week', 'watching', 'again', 'again', 'are', 'very', 'educational', 'very', 'tricky', 'how', 'add', 'education', 'there', 'are', 'there', 'help', 'children', 'understand', 'morals', 'are', 'not', 'preachy', 'have', 'point', 'are', 'just', 'fun', 'perfect.Charlie', 'Lola', 'are', 'highly', 'recommended', 'children', 'even', 'child', 'are', 'enjoyable.But', 'Charlie']",Charlie & Lola: The Absolutely Completely Complete Seasons One and Two

The children are very kind, say please and thank you.  They do have conflicts and are worked out in very creative ways.  The Christmas episode actually says, ""Baby Jesus"" and they sing the song ""Away in a Manger"". I really appreciated that since I do believe in Jesus and celebrate his birthday as Christmas day. It's refreshing to find the true meaning recognized in a childrens show, where American's are so afraid to mention Jesus on his birthday, he's been all but removed, it's ridiculous.  I am very happy with these videos, and would recommend them to any parent looking for quality programming that you do not have to worry about what your child is watching.",5,"Wonderful show for children, non violent, kind teaches manners....",1301529600,"03 31, 2011",2011,722,"['programs', 'are', 'so', 'fantastic', 'are', 'non-violent', 'children', 'are', 'very', 'kind', 'say', 'please', 'thank', 'do', 'have', 'conflicts', 'are', 'worked', 'out', 'very', 'creative', 'ways', 'Christmas', 'episode', 'actually', 'Baby', 'Jesus', 'sing', 'song', 'Away', 'Manger', 'really', 'appreciated', 'do', 'believe', 'Jesus', 'celebrate', 'birthday', 'Christmas', 'day', 'refreshing', 'find', 'true', 'meaning', 'recognized', 'childrens', 'show', 'where', 'American', 'are', 'so', 'afraid', 'mention', 'Jesus', 'birthday', 'been', 'removed', 'ridiculous', 'am', 'very', 'happy', 'videos', 'would', 'recommend', 'parent', 'looking', 'quality', 'programming', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'worry', 'what', 'child', 'watching']",Charlie & Lola: The Absolutely Completely Complete Seasons One and Two

We had all their DVD's but they were the wrong region for us as now we live in Florida. Last year i was looking for the dvds like this but could't find any. Now i've found these, she watches them all the time and gives me some peace and quiet!They come in the cases and the jacket as pictured, which is also great because that way she can keep them all neat.There are a few DVD's missing, in the sense of it only goes up to 8 and i know that there are 12, so i suppose we're meant to buy those separately, that was a bit annoying.

Here's why:***The children are thoughtful and kind to one another (no bratty sass);***Charlie and Lola are loving brother and sister in an age where siblings are rivals;***They work through their problems together;***They use their imaginations, in fact, the show's foundation is based on using the imagination;***The kids are adorable, realistic to their ages, and have wonderful senses of humor.16-month old Baby Jane watches an episode before bedtime with a big grin and smiling eyes, and I feel good about what she's absorbing. Heck, it's even soothing to have on in the background while I'm doing dishes. We've watched through volume five, and so far picture and sound quality has been excellent. I'll be watching this show when I'm fifty, it brings such a good feeling of love and humor into our home.Thank you Lauren Child.
