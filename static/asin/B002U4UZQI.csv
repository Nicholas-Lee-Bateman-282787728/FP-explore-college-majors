All of the 4 are excellent movies - ones that the whole family can enjoy. All of them involve children and their families, the modern day hardships that children experience - even though the movies are 10 years++ old - they still are relevant in what children experience. All of the movies are heart warming and very funny. My favorite is Corrina Corrina - and now that i have seen the others - they are great too. They also deal with the black/white issue - how children see it before they are jaded - how they work through it with love - not hatred.

One latest such bargain was a collection of four Whoopi Goldberg movies. The two DVDs were double sided with a movie on each side. They worked fine, but you have to be careful of getting fingerprints on them.In any case, all the movies in this set were enjoyable feel-good stories with happy endings. Of course, they were humorous from place to place. My top favorites were ""Corrina, Corrina"" and ""Made in America,"" but the other two were not far behind. All were well done in the moviemaking ways. I reviewed each movie under the separate titles and my intent here is to review the package. Whoopi Goldberg is one of those Hollywood stars that has a large enthusiastic fan base and, if you're one of them, you'd like this package of DVDs. However, they're rather lightweight as movies go and if you're looking for something more serious, I'd look elsewhere.Gary Peterson",4,"Light, Humorous, Well Done.",1332547200,"03 24, 2012",2012,942,"['buy', 'lot', 'movies', 'DVD', 'bargain', 'rack', 'nearby', 'Ross', 'store', 'One', 'latest', 'such', 'bargain', 'was', 'collection', 'four', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'movies', 'two', 'DVDs', 'were', 'double', 'sided', 'movie', 'side', 'worked', 'fine', 'have', 'be', 'careful', 'getting', 'fingerprints', 'them.In', 'case', 'movies', 'set', 'were', 'enjoyable', 'feel-good', 'stories', 'happy', 'endings', 'course', 'were', 'humorous', 'place', 'place', 'top', 'favorites', 'were', 'Corrina', 'Corrina', 'Made', 'America', 'other', 'two', 'were', 'not', 'far', 'were', 'well', 'done', 'moviemaking', 'ways', 'reviewed', 'movie', 'separate', 'titles', 'intent', 'here', 'review', 'package', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'stars', 'large', 'enthusiastic', 'fan', 'base', ""'re"", 'one', ""'d"", 'like', 'package', 'DVDs', 'However', ""'re"", 'rather', 'lightweight', 'movies', 'go', ""'re"", 'looking', 'something', 'more', 'serious', ""'d"", 'look', 'elsewhere.Gary', 'Peterson']",4 Film Favorites: Whoopi Goldberg (Bogus / Clara's Heart / Corrina / Corina / Made In America)
