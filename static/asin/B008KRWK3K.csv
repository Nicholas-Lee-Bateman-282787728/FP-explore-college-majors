World history has changed by the ""unknown"" and still keep the conversations of belief and non-belief in the programs. Having worked for NASA and a belief in a superior being, I am still in awe of the many things man will continue to conceive or understand, and our reasons for why we are here on this third planet from the Sun!

It may not be aliens but something other than what I was taught in school happened.  This is a great series for the whole family.  The locations that you are taken to are better than any travel show.  The world and mankind is truly more fascinating than any school book shows.,5,The Perfect Gift That Makes You Think,1396828800,"04 7, 2014",2014,383,"['series', 'outstanding', 'watching', 'series', 'think', 'history', 'needs', 'be', 're-investigated', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'aliens', 'something', 'other', 'what', 'was', 'taught', 'school', 'happened', 'great', 'series', 'whole', 'family', 'locations', 'are', 'taken', 'are', 'better', 'travel', 'show', 'world', 'mankind', 'truly', 'more', 'fascinating', 'school', 'book', 'shows']",N/A

Is season 5 in this package?  At the this time I have seen no extra details of what is offered.As far as content I have particularily enjoyed seasons 1 - 3 with season 4 being a stretch and I stopped watching season 5.  I will buy 5 when it comes out.  Obviously none of the other reviewers have purchased this particular package either.The camera work is excellent and the questions the writers bring out are ones that I have asked over the years without getting a reply that has satisfied me.  Plus, I had no idea that most of these ancient wonders even existed!  Whether there were ancient aliens or not the theories expounded on by these shows make more sense than anything I have seen/heard to date.  This includes the explanations for religious stories which never made sense to me.  If I had to choose between the current religious dogma and the theories in this television series to explain the ancient world these DVDs make a lot more sense.All in all the series is well done and expresses the views of the Ancient Aliens theorists.  Well worth my time watching.",5,What is in this product more than the individual seasons?,1360368000,"02 9, 2013",2013,1270,"['have', 'purchased', 'first', '4', 'seasons', 'show', 'less', 'half', 'price', 'collectors', 'edition', 'so', 'would', 'like', 'know', 'what', 'disks', 'would', 'make', 'worth', 'extra', 'money', 'season', '5', 'package', 'time', 'have', 'seen', 'extra', 'details', 'what', 'offered.As', 'far', 'content', 'have', 'particularily', 'enjoyed', 'seasons', '1', '3', 'season', '4', 'being', 'stretch', 'stopped', 'watching', 'season', '5', 'will', 'buy', '5', 'when', 'out', 'Obviously', 'none', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'purchased', 'particular', 'package', 'either.The', 'camera', 'work', 'excellent', 'questions', 'writers', 'bring', 'out', 'are', 'ones', 'have', 'asked', 'years', 'getting', 'reply', 'satisfied', 'had', 'idea', 'most', 'ancient', 'wonders', 'even', 'existed', 'were', 'ancient', 'aliens', 'not', 'theories', 'expounded', 'shows', 'make', 'more', 'sense', 'anything', 'have', 'seen/heard', 'date', 'explanations', 'religious', 'stories', 'never', 'made', 'sense', 'had', 'choose', 'current', 'religious', 'dogma', 'theories', 'television', 'series', 'explain', 'ancient', 'world', 'DVDs', 'make', 'lot', 'more', 'sense.All', 'series', 'well', 'done', 'views', 'Ancient', 'Aliens', 'theorists', 'Well', 'time', 'watching']",N/A
