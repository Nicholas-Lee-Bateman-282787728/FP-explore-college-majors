My 9.5 years daughter really enjoyed it. It reminded her about story of Pilgrims coming to America.Although the story was probably fictional it was interesting since it had one main topic and a moral dilemma. Who should a person be loyal to and what is more important -  loyalty or passion.I did not rate it with 5 stars since some parts of the movie were not consistent. In the beginning Bach is presented  as an angry, almost violent man, then he is becoming a very understanding and even compromising, although he never compromises his music. Good action, nice costumes, I wish it was more factual and it talks more about Bach's music and his life in overall and less about a small boy who was so perfect and almost saved bach's freedom. But maybe this is a reason why children like it because they can identify with this small boy.",4,My daughter really enjoyed it,1265760000,"02 10, 2010",2010,957,"['very', 'good', 'introduction', 'young', 'kids', 'music', 'how', 'people', 'lived', 'Germany', 'first', 'half', 'XVIII', 'century', '9.5', 'years', 'daughter', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'reminded', 'story', 'Pilgrims', 'coming', 'America.Although', 'story', 'was', 'probably', 'fictional', 'was', 'interesting', 'had', 'one', 'main', 'topic', 'moral', 'dilemma', 'Who', 'should', 'person', 'be', 'loyal', 'what', 'more', 'important', 'loyalty', 'passion.I', 'did', 'not', 'rate', '5', 'stars', 'parts', 'movie', 'were', 'not', 'consistent', 'beginning', 'Bach', 'presented', 'angry', 'almost', 'violent', 'man', 'then', 'becoming', 'very', 'understanding', 'even', 'compromising', 'never', 'music', 'Good', 'action', 'nice', 'costumes', 'wish', 'was', 'more', 'factual', 'more', 'Bach', 'music', 'life', 'overall', 'less', 'small', 'boy', 'who', 'was', 'so', 'perfect', 'almost', 'saved', 'bach', 'freedom', 'maybe', 'reason', 'why', 'children', 'can', 'identify', 'small', 'boy']",Bach's Fight for Freedom VHS

Bach *did* have a stormy temper, particularly when his patrons yanked him around at their whim and fancy. He *did* sometimes have some trouble getting anyone to encourage or financially support his secular works. And he *most definitely* faced a quandary of what to do with his life, torn between providing for his large family and suffering under the monotony of being a chess piece to noblemen.Alright, so the acting isn't top-notch, but if I understand correctly, this was really only meant to be a short movie for children, not a historically accurate and Olivier-quality piece for the grown-ups. It's still pretty cute. It still puts a positive light on classical music, and it suggests the idea that it was far from just stuffy music played by people in dumb white wigs. The people who wrote it were dreamers, bravely bold and boldly brave, often risky and not always accepted the first time around. Many famous classical composers were deeply imperfect people who were just trying to get their ideas out there and perhaps scrape a living together. Bach had fire in his belly and everyone knew it, and he had to reconcile that with the rules-heavy world of his day, for the entire duration of his (sometimes constricted) life.  Yes, this program has ""messages,"" but many videos for children DO have messages, and the ones in here are good!Is it hoaky? Yes. Historically inaccurate? Yes. A pointless waste of 50 minutes? No!!! I have seen children watch this movie and turn it over in their little heads. This is still one of the less goofy ways out there to subtly expose children to classical music without bogging them down with music theory they won't remotely understand. This isn't a constant cringe-fest like some other tripe they push on children these days. I would rather get a child interested in great music and explain inaccuracies later instead of just make the entire experience a chore from the very beginning. This little movie has some glimmers of real grace in it, and that's worth watching no matter the inaccuracies and amateur production. This was basically a sincere effort and I choose to take my hat off to them for trying.",4,"Cute as a kid's movie, even with its flaws",1372723200,"07 2, 2013",2013,2293,"['Okay', 'ca', ""n't"", 'prove', 'most', 'characters', 'movie', 'ever', 'existed', 'are', 'still', 'grains', 'truth', 'little', 'fantasy', 'Bach', '*did*', 'have', 'stormy', 'temper', 'particularly', 'when', 'patrons', 'yanked', 'around', 'whim', 'fancy', '*did*', 'sometimes', 'have', 'trouble', 'getting', 'anyone', 'encourage', 'financially', 'support', 'secular', 'works', '*most', 'definitely*', 'faced', 'quandary', 'what', 'do', 'life', 'torn', 'providing', 'large', 'family', 'suffering', 'monotony', 'being', 'chess', 'piece', 'noblemen.Alright', 'acting', ""n't"", 'top-notch', 'understand', 'correctly', 'was', 'really', 'only', 'meant', 'be', 'short', 'movie', 'children', 'not', 'historically', 'accurate', 'Olivier-quality', 'piece', 'grown-ups', 'still', 'pretty', 'cute', 'still', 'positive', 'light', 'classical', 'music', 'idea', 'was', 'far', 'just', 'stuffy', 'music', 'played', 'people', 'dumb', 'white', 'wigs', 'people', 'who', 'wrote', 'were', 'dreamers', 'bravely', 'bold', 'boldly', 'brave', 'often', 'risky', 'not', 'always', 'accepted', 'first', 'time', 'around', 'Many', 'famous', 'classical', 'composers', 'were', 'deeply', 'imperfect', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'just', 'trying', 'get', 'ideas', 'there', 'perhaps', 'scrape', 'living', 'together', 'Bach', 'had', 'fire', 'belly', 'everyone', 'knew', 'had', 'reconcile', 'rules-heavy', 'world', 'day', 'entire', 'duration', 'sometimes', 'constricted', 'life', 'Yes', 'program', 'messages', 'many', 'videos', 'children', 'DO', 'have', 'messages', 'ones', 'here', 'are', 'good', 'hoaky', 'Yes', 'Historically', 'inaccurate', 'Yes', 'pointless', 'waste', '50', 'minutes', 'No', 'have', 'seen', 'children', 'watch', 'movie', 'turn', 'over', 'little', 'heads', 'still', 'one', 'less', 'goofy', 'ways', 'there', 'subtly', 'expose', 'children', 'classical', 'music', 'bogging', 'down', 'music', 'theory', 'wo', ""n't"", 'remotely', 'understand', ""n't"", 'constant', 'cringe-fest', 'other', 'tripe', 'push', 'children', 'days', 'would', 'rather', 'get', 'child', 'interested', 'great', 'music', 'explain', 'inaccuracies', 'later', 'instead', 'just', 'make', 'entire', 'experience', 'chore', 'very', 'beginning', 'little', 'movie', 'glimmers', 'real', 'grace', 'worth', 'watching', 'matter', 'inaccuracies', 'amateur', 'production', 'was', 'basically', 'sincere', 'effort', 'choose', 'take', 'hat', 'trying']",Bach's Fight for Freedom VHS

It is, at the very least, a way to show what people may have looked like in Bach's time.  Bach's music is played throughout, which is wonderful.  The most appealing thing is that it is a fun story for children to watch.  That's enough all by itself.The only thing that concerns me is the fiction.  Bach was a man deeply faithful in his place and duty before God as a musician.  This doesn't come across in the least.  Unfortunately, one's religion almost never makes it to the final cut of children's movies no matter how vital it is to the truth and reality about a person of historical significance.  That seems to be more artistic license than ought to be allowed.Just the same, the story is fun.
