640254,AW3VZ5O895LRK,B00005JOHC,"carol irvin ""carol irvin""","[5, 8]","Charlie Sheen is a very good actor.  I enjoyed him in movies, especially in PLATOON and WALL STREET. He thereafter made a lot of duds in film and then, following in his father's footsteps, he turned to being a star in a tv series. I can't say that he does a bad job on this series.  For what it is, he delivers.  I guess where I have a problem is that this series is such a throwback to the past and not in a good way.  If MAD MEN makes us look back at ourselves during sexist times we'd rather forget now, this series brings those days into the here and now.  Worse, it seems to revel in them. I suppose it also reminds me of the Doris Day-Rock Hudson movies where Rock chases women and evades women like Day only to be bagged by Day in the end.  Charlie could be a present day version of the Rock character but he never meets Doris.  He just keeps going and going in his usual women chasing ways, never to be bagged. The twist offered here is a nephew and a brother to provide the counter balance of family and tradition.  Charlie is stuck with them and their more middle class values in the wake of his brother's divorce.  I made it half way through this DVD series and gave up. This series might be for someone else but it's not for me.  I just don't care about Charlie, his life or his problems and that is fatal for enjoying this series.",3,Not Horrible But I Couldn't Continue Watching It,1250726400,"08 20, 2009",2009,1343,"['Charlie', 'Sheen', 'very', 'good', 'actor', 'enjoyed', 'movies', 'especially', 'PLATOON', 'WALL', 'STREET', 'thereafter', 'made', 'lot', 'duds', 'film', 'then', 'following', 'father', 'footsteps', 'turned', 'being', 'star', 'tv', 'series', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'bad', 'job', 'series', 'what', 'guess', 'where', 'have', 'problem', 'series', 'such', 'throwback', 'past', 'not', 'good', 'way', 'MAD', 'MEN', 'look', 'back', 'ourselves', 'sexist', 'times', ""'d"", 'rather', 'forget', 'now', 'series', 'days', 'here', 'now', 'Worse', 'revel', 'suppose', 'also', 'Doris', 'Day-Rock', 'Hudson', 'movies', 'where', 'Rock', 'women', 'evades', 'women', 'Day', 'only', 'be', 'bagged', 'Day', 'end', 'Charlie', 'could', 'be', 'present', 'day', 'version', 'Rock', 'character', 'never', 'Doris', 'just', 'going', 'going', 'usual', 'women', 'chasing', 'ways', 'never', 'be', 'bagged', 'twist', 'offered', 'here', 'nephew', 'brother', 'provide', 'counter', 'balance', 'family', 'tradition', 'Charlie', 'stuck', 'more', 'middle', 'class', 'values', 'wake', 'brother', 'divorce', 'made', 'half', 'way', 'DVD', 'series', 'gave', 'up', 'series', 'might', 'be', 'someone', 'else', 'not', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'Charlie', 'life', 'problems', 'fatal', 'enjoying', 'series']",TWO AND A HALF MEN: S1(DVD)

640261,A1FW37K0DKH5M9,B00005JOHC,David Seaman,"[0, 0]","Chuck Lorre is a brilliant man; a complex but calm man who has realized that as the boss in a performing arts company he must remain calm and staid because almost no one else will, He got his start, as most of the Hollywood writing staff did, on Roseanne, where his writing skills were honed under the demands of a woman who planned out an entire series between season two and three.Roseanne was making a plug for women's rights and it centered on the fact that women were capable of doing just about anything. Sadly, in the late 80'ws and early 90's the methods she used were by making men seem like idiots. John Goodman is not only a brilliant actor and a man who clearly wanted out of his  contract in season nine, managed to come across as a wonderful man; a feminist who refused to give up his maleness. Still, we watched Roseanne hit him in the head with a cast iron skillet one too many times. When Roseanna (who had a philosophy that any writer had one or two good season in him and then it was time to cut him loose- she was wrong) released Lorre, he went on to create Dharma and Greg, Becker, Two and a Half Men and The Big Bang Theory. Lorre manages to do well by surrounding himself with outstanding people and allowing them to do their jobs. There is plenty of laughter on the set and Charlie Sheen aside, there are no ""stars"" on his shows. The Big Bang Theory is an excellent example of ensemble work we haven't seen since Marta Kaufman and David Crane gave us ""Friends.""Two and a Half Men is about two unmarried brothers. Charlie (played by Charlie Sheen), two years older, who has managed a career as a musician writing jingles for advertising- bringing in vast amounts of money, a house on Malibu Beach and an endless supply of single malt scotch. Alan (Jon Cryer) is an anal retentive chiropractor- not quite a doctor- who was kicked out of his home a la Felix Unger by his wife of twelve years named Judith.(Marin Hatch) They share custody of a boy, Jake (expertly played by Angus T. Jones) whp is lazy, fraqnk and has the typical locker room humor of a young adolescent. The premise- at first- was to see how an adolescent boy would co-exist with a single uncle who is living with a Peter Pan comp-lex, bringing in woman after woman foir meaningless one night stands, developing a reputation where by almost anywhere he goes woman are saying ""Hi, Charlie"" or ""Charlie, you filthy creep! You ruined my life.""On the surface, Alan comes across as the better behaved of the two and we strongly suspect that Lorre intended this. However, Alan begins to make up for last time and despite the many jokes about Charlie thinking with his penis, we noticed that soon enough Alans penis was doing all of HIS thinking and at a substantially lower IQ than that of Charlie's. Aolan spends all of his time comp0laining about how easily things come to Charlie while he has had t5o dfight for every single failure in his life. What is left to us to see is that Charlie has just as many challenges and failures as Alan but has learned not to complain about them. His relaxed attitude serves him better than Alan's constant anxiety and explosive diarrhea. Still, it is often Charlie who gets a surprise trip to the Emergency room. Charlie is the one who's got a stalker and had his testicles super glued to his thighs. Charlie is the one who is a kind man and wants nothing more than kindness in return. Alan is unable to see this and thus feels great jealousy about the fact that he feels that he struggles and struggles, loses everything, while Charlie has gold falling from the sky.Alan wastes every opportunity he has. His second marriage comes about a year and a half after Judith has thrown him out and he ends up in a weekend long sex marathon with a girl whose body is spectacular and her very loe I.Q. somehow makes her even more sexy. She is enamored by Alan;s sweetness and doesn;lt mind that she is half his age. She struts around the house in a bikini, to the delight of young Jakes and, during a foolish moment in Las Vegas, Alan marries her. Fifteen minutes later a single coin in the slot wins him a half million dollars and then four months after that she has thrown him out and he has eleven dollars left.;And Charlie is the fool?The show doesn't make any attempts to teach us lessons and this is nice. After all we wept through Family Ties, M*A*S*H*, Designing Women and even Roseanna, but it is nice to have a TV series where there is never any growth- a pure half hour of comedy.As each season passes we see that both men are destroyed by childhood issues stemming from a terrible mother played expertly by the clkassic Holland Taylor). The boys father died when they were swtill in elementary school by food poisoning of fish. ""( I was a new housewife and learning to cook, "": Said Evelyn- their mother, ""How was I to know that fish couldn't be kept in a drawer? ""Charlie contends that his father KNEW the fish was bad and he ate it anyway. Alan refuses to discuss it. After his death came a string of ""Uncles"" who helped to raise the boys. Alan became the type A child who did anything he could to please but never succeeded. Charlie simply began to drink and have indiscriminate sex. They endured boarding school, Charlie got out as fast as he could and Alan married a duplicate of his mother. Alan gets reamed for both Alimony and Child Support. He loses the house, all the money, the furniture and the car. Why? Because Charlie couldn't heolp himself and slept with, then dumped, Alan;s attorney.Similar episodes occurred with Jake's Karate teacher, den mother, fifth grade teacher and countless others.Charlie falls in love more often and Alan ends up in terrible situations because off his loud but stupid penis. (a true highlight is his venture into computer dating when Alison JAnney plays a date who leaves, saying good night to Charlie, explaining she has to get up for work and that Alan has turned into bed for the night. Charlie who is plagued by being in love with a ballet dancer who will be traveling, enters Alan's room to see him cuffed at fours in red stockings, arm gloves and leather corset and panties.Alison Janney is an excellent example of the remarkable guest stars that visit this show. Martin Sheen plays an emotionally unbalanced father of Charlie's stalker, Rose (perhaps the gem of the series), Robert Wagner plays the boys father and as a result of a fun conversation between Chuck Lorre and the creator of CSI, a switch of writing staffs occur creating a hysterical episode here and a wonderful CSI parody. CLoris Leachman  moves in next door, Sean Penn and Elvis Costello play themselves in a support group with Charlie. Martin Mull is a remarkable pharmacist trying to compete with the larger chains and copes by delving into the sample drawers. He pays three sets of alimony but not a cent of child support. It goes on and on.The gem of the series is Conchetta Ferrall who plays Berta, Charlie's housekeeper who does much more than keeps house. She is part of the family and her wit and wisdom is curt and cute. Nothing disgusts her (one morning after finding a bra abd panties on the kitchen table with the bananas and the butter says, ""Good God, I'm workin;' for Caligula."" She's a good woman, the mother of a handful of failure girls for whom she'd face a meth chemist to extort $5,000 in pre-paid child support. She could have only five lines in a scene and still manage to steal it. The house can't run without Berta and she and Charlie have a strong relationship, well defined and honed over the course of many years.Okay. The writing is full of 8th grade fart jokes but they're cleverly written so that one must delve into intelligence to get the meaning. There's a great deal of gas, as a result of a 12 year old boy who will (and can) eat anything and has no shame. We have watched only up to season six and we suppose that there's not a soul in America who has not heard of the medical condition that crashed Charlie Sheen. We have not seen that final season as his illness took him down nor have we viewed any of the new seasons with the adorable and perpetually adolescent Ashton Kutcher. The series is approaching it';s 200tgh episode, something rarely seen in television so that there are 8 seasons before Mr Sheen's illness affects the show- if at all. We will revisit this subject when the time comes, but in the mean time, score this one as a way of understanding men- of making up for the men hating Roseanne and at looking at two emotionally damaged men and why. All the women in this series are depicted as equally damaged with the expception of Berta and Charlie's stalker. There is the regular appearance of a therapist- a [psychiatrist who still does therapy at $250 an hour and from time to time all two and a half men have sat with her. She played a phys ed teacher on Old Christine and now has a lead in the show Glee- the only actress in Hollywood taller than Alison Janney, she spends most of her scenes seated in her expensive chair making jokes at the expens fo Charlie or Alan and helping them to come to terms with what haunts them.Yes, it took us years to open our arms to Two and a half Men because at first, it appears to be arm-pit farts and network Pokys, but it is ever so much more. This is a good one for everyone and even more so for any man who has been under the control over the stronger sex.",4,"One of the btter ones; Not art, but excellent vaudeville",1356652800,"12 28,

This program is frequently panned by television critics in Australia, and I can't, for the life of me, figure out why, since this is one of the funniest shows I have seen in years. The scripts are great and never fail to make me laugh (although, be warned, given that the main character is a chronic womanizer, many of the jokes are a bit off-colour), but what really makes this show stand out it its cast. It's not just the two leads, Charlie Sheen and Jon Cryer, who make this show (although both fit perfectly into their respective roles, and often, just seeing the look on Sheen's face, is enough to get me chuckling), but also Holland Taylor (one of the funniest, and most underrated, actresses of all time) as Sheen and Cryer's self-absorbed and domineering mother, who steals every scene she is in, and Melanie Lynskey as Rose, Sheen's slightly-psychotic ex-girlfriend, who also happens to be one of the most surreal characters on prime-time television.

I wasn't disappointed!The premise of the show centers around two very different brothers -- laidback, vice-filled jingle-writer Charlie (Charlie Sheen) and neurotic chiropractor Alan (Jon Cryer) -- who are forced to share Charlie's posh Malibu home after Alan's divorce. Along for the ride are Jake, Alan's young son, and Berta, Charlie's wise-cracking and crass housekeeper.Particularly memorable episodes include ""An Old Flame with a New Wick,"" where Charlie learns an old girlfriend has become a man; and ""Big Flappy Bastards,"" where the guys try to get rid of a houseful of seagulls Jake accidentally let in.Although many of the storylines quickly become familiar -- Charlie's careless one-night stands, Alan's money woes and battles with ex-wife Judith, both brothers' uncomfortable relationship with their less-than-maternal mother Evelyn -- they never turn stale. Perhaps it's because just as in life, we all have a number of ever-present situations, so it's to be expected that the Harpers also battle the same demons on a regular basis. But it could also be that the wit and grace with which ""Two and Half Men"" tackle every problem is very human, and guaranteed to bring viewers near their hearts -- flawed though they might be.Those who enjoy DVD sets for the extras shouldn't be disappointed, as this set includes several -- a behind-the-scenes chat with cast and crew; a backstage tour with Angus T. Jones, who plays Jake; and bloopers.Five stars for a show whose writing and acting is consistently fresh, never failing to provide its audience with new laughs.",5,Hilarious and endearing,1193270400,"10 25, 2007",2007,1681,"['Not', 'having', 'gotten', 'show', '2006', 'was', 'pretty', 'excited', 'chance', 'purchase', 'Season', '1', 'DVD', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed', 'premise', 'show', 'around', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'brothers', 'laidback', 'vice-filled', 'jingle-writer', 'Charlie', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'neurotic', 'chiropractor', 'Alan', 'Jon', 'Cryer', 'who', 'are', 'forced', 'share', 'Charlie', 'posh', 'Malibu', 'home', 'Alan', 'divorce', 'ride', 'are', 'Jake', 'Alan', 'young', 'son', 'Berta', 'Charlie', 'wise-cracking', 'crass', 'housekeeper.Particularly', 'memorable', 'episodes', 'include', 'Old', 'Flame', 'New', 'Wick', 'where', 'Charlie', 'old', 'girlfriend', 'become', 'man', 'Big', 'Flappy', 'Bastards', 'where', 'guys', 'try', 'get', 'rid', 'houseful', 'seagulls', 'Jake', 'accidentally', 'let', 'in.Although', 'many', 'storylines', 'quickly', 'become', 'familiar', 'Charlie', 'careless', 'one-night', 'stands', 'Alan', 'money', 'woes', 'battles', 'ex-wife', 'Judith', 'brothers', 'uncomfortable', 'relationship', 'less-than-maternal', 'mother', 'Evelyn', 'never', 'turn', 'stale', 'Perhaps', 'because', 'just', 'life', 'have', 'number', 'ever-present', 'situations', 'be', 'expected', 'Harpers', 'also', 'battle', 'same', 'demons', 'regular', 'basis', 'could', 'also', 'be', 'wit', 'grace', 'Two', 'Half', 'Men', 'tackle', 'problem', 'very', 'human', 'guaranteed', 'bring', 'viewers', 'hearts', 'flawed', 'might', 'be.Those', 'who', 'enjoy', 'DVD', 'sets', 'extras', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'set', 'several', 'behind-the-scenes', 'chat', 'cast', 'crew', 'backstage', 'tour', 'Angus', 'T.', 'Jones', 'who', 'Jake', 'bloopers.Five', 'stars', 'show', 'writing', 'acting', 'consistently', 'fresh', 'never', 'failing', 'provide', 'audience', 'new', 'laughs']",TWO AND A HALF MEN: S1(DVD)

640286,A36EW68H08UOCS,B00005JOHC,"Mark J. Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[0, 0]","Co-creator Chuck Lorre has been involved in several good sit-coms, a television form that we can see degenerating before our very eyes as producers found out that people would just as happily watch a television show that consists of a collection of nobodies with no discernible talent being followed by a camera.If that sounds like an editorial comment aimed at bashing reality television - you are correct, and my advise is to make your OWN lives interesting enough that you're not tempted to watch a television show that consists of the exploits of real people less interesting than YOU!But I digress.  I enjoyed Lorre's previous shows: Roseanne, Grace under Fire, Dharma and Greg, but it wasn't until I became addicted to the genius ""Big Bang Theory"" that I decided to go back and check out ""Two and a Half Men.""I see ""Men"" described as a modern version of ""The Odd Couple"", and there are similarities as both shows featured a fastidious man who is kicked out by his wife, then moves in with a slob.  ""Men"" stars Charlie Sheen as older Casanova Charlie Harper.  Charlie is a jingle-writer and has made enough money to live in a Malibu beach-house where he avoids work and responsibility and beds as many bimbos as possible.  Jon Cryer plays brother Alan, a chiropractor who has an inferiority complex about essentially everything.  Alan's son Jake is played by Angus T. Jones and provides the writers an opportunity to exploit the ways that young Jake may be influenced by Charlie's degenerate lifestyle.Melanie Lynskey steals her scenes as Rose, a neighbor who has been stalking Charlie ever since a one-night stand.  Holland Taylor plays the brother's shallow, self-centered mother Evelyn and Marin Hinkle plays Judith, the cold-hearted wife who booted Alan.  Conchata Ferrell is another scene-stealer as Berta, Charlie's no-nonsense housekeeper.  Berta sees people for what they are, and as the show is populated with one character flaw after another, Berta has ample opportunity to unleash her sarcasm with maximum comedic effect.I withhold my highest recommendation because the characters are shallow and one-dimensional.  Charlie is perpetually irresponsible and completely lacking respect for any woman while he is more than willing to engage any dim-witted beauty in a sexual encounter.  Alan is perpetually downtrodden and lacking respect from himself or others.  The other characters are even more ""one-note"".I find ""The Big Band Theory"" better than any comedy on television today.  I find ""Two and a Half Men"" better than any of those shows where a camera follows people I don't know.",4,Chuck Lorre was warming up,1259625600,"12 1, 2009",2009,2598,"['Co-creator', 'Chuck', 'Lorre', 'been', 'involved', 'several', 'good', 'sit-coms', 'television', 'form', 'can', 'see', 'degenerating', 'very', 'eyes', 'producers', 'found', 'out', 'people', 'would', 'just', 'happily', 'watch', 'television', 'show', 'collection', 'nobodies', 'discernible', 'talent', 'being', 'followed', 'camera.If', 'editorial', 'comment', 'aimed', 'bashing', 'reality', 'television', 'are', 'correct', 'advise', 'make', 'OWN', 'lives', 'interesting', 'enough', ""'re"", 'not', 'tempted', 'watch', 'television', 'show', 'exploits', 'real', 'people', 'less', 'interesting', 'YOU', 'digress', 'enjoyed', 'Lorre', 'previous', 'shows', 'Roseanne', 'Grace', 'Fire', 'Dharma', 'Greg', 'was', ""n't"", 'became', 'addicted', 'genius', 'Big', 'Bang', 'Theory', 'decided', 'go', 'back', 'check', 'out', 'Two', 'Half', 'Men', 'see', 'Men', 'described', 'modern', 'version', 'Odd', 'Couple', 'are', 'similarities', 'shows', 'featured', 'fastidious', 'man', 'who', 'kicked', 'out', 'wife', 'then', 'slob', 'Men', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'older', 'Casanova', 'Charlie', 'Harper', 'Charlie', 'jingle-writer', 'made', 'enough', 'money', 'live', 'Malibu', 'beach-house', 'where', 'work', 'responsibility', 'beds', 'many', 'bimbos', 'possible', 'Jon', 'Cryer', 'brother', 'Alan', 'chiropractor', 'who', 'inferiority', 'complex', 'essentially', 'everything', 'Alan', 'son', 'Jake', 'played', 'Angus', 'T.', 'Jones', 'writers', 'opportunity', 'exploit', 'ways', 'young', 'Jake', 'may', 'be', 'influenced', 'Charlie', 'degenerate', 'lifestyle.Melanie', 'Lynskey', 'scenes', 'Rose', 'neighbor', 'who', 'been', 'stalking', 'Charlie', 'ever', 'one-night', 'stand', 'Holland', 'Taylor', 'brother', 'shallow', 'self-centered', 'mother', 'Evelyn', 'Marin', 'Hinkle', 'Judith', 'cold-hearted', 'wife', 'who', 'booted', 'Alan', 'Conchata', 'Ferrell', 'scene-stealer', 'Berta', 'Charlie', 'no-nonsense', 'housekeeper', 'Berta', 'people', 'what', 'are', 'show', 'populated', 'one', 'character', 'flaw', 'Berta', 'ample', 'opportunity', 'unleash', 'sarcasm', 'maximum', 'comedic', 'effect.I', 'withhold', 'highest', 'recommendation', 'characters', 'are', 'shallow', 'one-dimensional', 'Charlie', 'perpetually', 'irresponsible', 'completely', 'lacking', 'respect', 'woman', 'more', 'willing', 'engage', 'dim-witted', 'beauty', 'sexual', 'encounter', 'Alan', 'perpetually', 'downtrodden', 'lacking', 'respect', 'others', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'even', 'more', 'one-note', '.I', 'find', 'Big', 'Band', 'Theory', 'better', 'comedy', 'television', 'today', 'find', 'Two', 'Half', 'Men', 'better', 'shows', 'where', 'camera', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'know']",TWO AND A HALF MEN: S1(DVD)

Charlie Sheen (Platoon) plays Charlie Harper, a fornicator of grandiose proportions, he has a given talent, but squanders it on the easy buck. Jon Cryer (No Small Affair) is Alan, a character weak at best, his only real strong trait his love for his son. The brothers mother (Holland Taylor) is deplorable on most occations, Alans former wife Judith (Marin Hinkle) is all business and neuroses. Our titular half man, Jake (Angus Jones), is a dunce, and not your lovable, smart mouthed, wise beyond his years, kind of kid most US sitcoms are filled to the brim with. The neighbour, Rose (Melanie Lynskey, Heavenly Creatures) is sweet, but may or may not be borderline dangerous.Despite all of this you got to love these flawed people, and that's probably why this is a success.

In the case of 2 and  Men, guess I'll catch it on cable because it really doesn't matter if it's viewed chronologically, mildly amusing, but no great shakes.The Charlie Sheen character has an ancestor on 1950's TV, the Bob Cummins role in Love That Bob. They should have stuck to that idea more closely, because the 1950's swinger and pinups seem to be having genuine fun.

This is one series that just hooks you in and you can't resist it.I wanted to especially see the extras on this set. Since others have told you pretty much which episodes are included, I'll go into a couple of the extras found on disc 4.One is a ""tour"" of the set with Angus (Jake). While less than 10 minutes long, it's still interesting as you get to see what exactly is around each corner on the set. What exactly IS at the top of the stairs? Is the house actually on the beach? What's around that corner in the kitchen were Berta usually goes or comes out of?Another extra is about 6 minutes of outtakes with some of the bloopers made during the recording of the series. Even though it's relatively short, it's a lot of fun to watch as each star makes his or her fair share of blunders.There's one other extra where there is a very good history of the series and how it developed. Is Charlie and Alan's ""Mom"" REALLY that grumpy in real life? How about Berta? How did they settle on hiring the stars to fit the parts? Was Rose originally to be a recurring role?Needless to say, the episodes are great in this set, and the extras definitely add to the fun.",5,GREAT SERIES,1218758400,"08 15, 2008",2008,1202,"['watch', 'TV', 'whenever', 'broadcast', 'one', 'series', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'resist', 'it.I', 'wanted', 'especially', 'see', 'extras', 'set', 'others', 'have', 'told', 'pretty', 'much', 'episodes', 'are', 'included', ""'ll"", 'go', 'couple', 'extras', 'found', 'disc', '4.One', 'tour', 'set', 'Angus', 'Jake', 'less', '10', 'minutes', 'long', 'still', 'interesting', 'get', 'see', 'what', 'exactly', 'corner', 'set', 'What', 'exactly', 'top', 'stairs', 'house', 'actually', 'beach', 'What', 'around', 'corner', 'kitchen', 'were', 'Berta', 'usually', 'extra', '6', 'minutes', 'outtakes', 'bloopers', 'made', 'recording', 'series', 'Even', 'relatively', 'short', 'lot', 'fun', 'watch', 'star', 'fair', 'share', 'blunders.There', 'one', 'other', 'extra', 'where', 'very', 'good', 'history', 'series', 'how', 'developed', 'Is', 'Charlie', 'Alan', 'Mom', 'REALLY', 'real', 'life', 'How', 'Berta', 'How', 'did', 'settle', 'hiring', 'stars', 'fit', 'parts', 'Was', 'Rose', 'originally', 'be', 'recurring', 'role', 'Needless', 'say', 'episodes', 'are', 'great', 'set', 'extras', 'definitely', 'add', 'fun']",TWO AND A HALF MEN: S1(DVD)
640303,A1L8HRCM60W0W7,B00005JOHC,Shashank Tripathi,"[20, 20]","Most of my friends who have seen this show wouldn't think twice before they concurred: it's flat out hilarious. I had my reservations about Charlie Sheen in a role not unlike his cameo at the tail-end ofSpin City--a suave yuppie and a consummate Lothario--but he is the delight of this party! Few can fit so snugly in the role of a relaxed, affluent young retiree lounging in his Malibu seafront apartment when he's not effortlessly schmoozing with the opposite gender. He's at his wry sharpest.There's excellent chemistry between him and Jon Cryer, who plays his uptight, righteous elder brother. As they tackle mature subjects such as frivolous relationships and artificial insemination and pretty much everything that surrounds this nature of things, the brother's smart-mouthed son is kept ever so cleverly in the dark. These parallel tracks of young and old humor lend the show some sparkling dimensions. The little boy, Angus Jones, is a natural. Some of us may have seen him at the Emmy Awards last year. An outspoken housekeeper, a domineering mother, and a cutting curmudgeon of an ex-wife round out an ensemble cast; any episode featuring Holland Taylor's portrayal of a prim and proper modern-day mom of the two brothers in her crisp Chanel skirts and bright red lipstick can almost guarantee a laugh-riot.The true hallmark of a successful sitcom is the degree to which you end up warming up to its characters. Amidst its spate of one-liners, 2&1/2 Men does a fairly decent job of making viewers relate to its characters. None of these archetypal characters is new, but each is idiosyncratic without being wildly over-the-top. There are even some touching episodes such as the one when Charlie's favorite neighborhood girl sets off to a distant destination, leaving his supposedly wooden heart all aflutter.If the recent drought of funny shows on TV is any indication, sitcoms are no cakewalk. There have only been a handful of the truly funny ones that did not run out of steam in their later days and kudos to the scriptwriters for making 2&1/2 Men belong plushly in that elite league! I must say I am not pleased with the damage that this 'introductory price' may wreak on your wallet, but that's a minor quibble for a DVD you know you're going to be watching more than once.",5,A SITCOM THAT DREW CONSISTENT LAUGHS,1180224000,"05 27, 2007",2007,2289,"['Most', 'friends', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'show', 'would', ""n't"", 'think', 'twice', 'concurred', 'flat', 'out', 'hilarious', 'had', 'reservations', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'role', 'not', 'cameo', 'tail-end', 'ofSpin', 'City', 'suave', 'yuppie', 'consummate', 'Lothario', 'delight', 'party', 'Few', 'can', 'fit', 'so', 'snugly', 'role', 'relaxed', 'affluent', 'young', 'retiree', 'lounging', 'Malibu', 'seafront', 'apartment', 'when', 'not', 'effortlessly', 'schmoozing', 'opposite', 'gender', 'wry', 'excellent', 'chemistry', 'Jon', 'Cryer', 'who', 'uptight', 'righteous', 'elder', 'brother', 'tackle', 'mature', 'subjects', 'such', 'frivolous', 'relationships', 'artificial', 'insemination', 'pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'nature', 'things', 'brother', 'smart-mouthed', 'son', 'kept', 'ever', 'so', 'cleverly', 'dark', 'parallel', 'tracks', 'young', 'old', 'humor', 'lend', 'show', 'sparkling', 'dimensions', 'little', 'boy', 'Angus', 'Jones', 'natural', 'may', 'have', 'seen', 'Emmy', 'Awards', 'last', 'year', 'outspoken', 'housekeeper', 'domineering', 'mother', 'cutting', 'curmudgeon', 'ex-wife', 'round', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'episode', 'featuring', 'Holland', 'Taylor', 'portrayal', 'prim', 'proper', 'modern-day', 'mom', 'two', 'brothers', 'crisp', 'Chanel', 'skirts', 'bright', 'red', 'lipstick', 'can', 'almost', 'guarantee', 'laugh-riot.The', 'true', 'hallmark', 'successful', 'sitcom', 'degree', 'end', 'up', 'warming', 'up', 'characters', 'Amidst', 'spate', 'one-liners', '2', '1/2', 'Men', 'fairly', 'decent', 'job', 'making', 'viewers', 'relate', 'characters', 'None', 'archetypal', 'characters', 'new', 'idiosyncratic', 'being', 'wildly', 'over-the-top', 'are', 'even', 'touching', 'episodes', 'such', 'one', 'when', 'Charlie', 'favorite', 'neighborhood', 'girl', 'distant', 'destination', 'leaving', 'supposedly', 'wooden', 'heart', 'aflutter.If', 'recent', 'drought', 'funny', 'shows', 'TV', 'indication', 'sitcoms', 'are', 'cakewalk', 'have', 'only', 'been', 'handful', 'truly', 'funny', 'ones', 'did', 'not', 'run', 'steam', 'later', 'days', 'kudos', 'scriptwriters', 'making', '2', '1/2', 'Men', 'belong', 'plushly', 'elite', 'league', 'must', 'say', 'am', 'not', 'pleased', 'damage', ""'introductory"", 'price', 'may', 'wreak', 'wallet', 'minor', 'quibble', 'DVD', 'know', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'watching', 'more', 'once']",TWO AND A HALF MEN: S1(DVD)

The episodes,while not rocket science,move along chronilogically to an appropriate and certain extent. It may sound like a stretch. Yet,depsite that,it is the fire and energy of ""Two and a Half Men"". This is the season where Alan Harper(Jon Cryer)was struggling to make ends meet by living with his older brother Charlie(Charlie Sheen)in the middle of his divorce from his wife Judith(Marin Hinkle)and being a single father to his son Jake(Angus T. Jones). The order helps ""Two and a Half Men"" come to life--in despite of its humor and,throughout certain times,the ""dramatic"" moments. The overall plot for the first season of ""Two and a Half Men"" creates antic humor that,instead of running low along the way,just gets better. It is humor that gives the situation several problems for the characters and gives several certain aspects to draw and come to life from. It works more than perfect for the humor written in it. With the richly executed style and talent in which the episodes are written,being brought to life by representation and the performances of the characters,the first season of ""Two and a Half Men"" is,by far,a winner. An excellent starting place for one of the funniest and most popular shows on television--period.To make things even better,the first season of ""Two and a Half Men"" couldn't have been better packaged. There are a total of three bonus feautures in this DVD set. The first feauturette,""Two Adults,One Kid,No Grown-Ups:Go Behind the Scenes with Cast and Crew"",tells how ""Two and a Half Men"" began and goes behind the scenes of the show's production,providing several interesting and enjoying facts. The second,""Backstage Tour with Angus T. Jones"",finds Angus T. Jones giving a tour of the set of ""Two and a Half Men"",showing how it is filmed and what life on the set is like. And then,you have a Gag Reel--which feautures several memorable and hillarious outtakes from the filming of the first season of ""Two and a Half Men"". Add all of that together with the ***entire*** set having good photographs from the episodes that are to be found here,alongside a booklet that has info on the episodes,you are in  luck with the first season DVD of ""Two and a Half Men"".Even if you just watch ""Two and a Half Men"" occasionally,still,don't forget to buy this DVD. It is the perfect way to sit back,have a good laugh,and be well acquainted with ""Two and a Half Men"",while no DVD ever represented a show so well.",5,Let the good times roll..........,1199577600,"01 6, 2008",2008,2662,"['first', 'season', 'DVD', 'Two', 'Half', 'Men', 'episode', 'show', 'major', 'treat.What', 'have', 'here', 'four-disc', 'set', 'twenty-four', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'Two', 'Half', 'Men', 'uncut', 'unedited', 'episodes', 'not', 'rocket', 'science', 'move', 'along', 'chronilogically', 'appropriate', 'certain', 'extent', 'may', 'sound', 'stretch', 'depsite', 'fire', 'energy', 'Two', 'Half', 'Men', 'season', 'where', 'Alan', 'Harper', 'Jon', 'Cryer', 'was', 'struggling', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'living', 'older', 'brother', 'Charlie', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'middle', 'divorce', 'wife', 'Judith', 'Marin', 'Hinkle', 'being', 'single', 'father', 'son', 'Jake', 'Angus', 'T.', 'Jones', 'order', 'Two', 'Half', 'Men', 'come', 'life', 'humor', 'certain', 'times', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'overall', 'plot', 'first', 'season', 'Two', 'Half', 'Men', 'antic', 'humor', 'instead', 'running', 'low', 'way', 'just', 'better', 'humor', 'situation', 'several', 'problems', 'characters', 'several', 'certain', 'aspects', 'draw', 'come', 'life', 'more', 'perfect', 'humor', 'written', 'richly', 'executed', 'style', 'talent', 'episodes', 'are', 'written', 'being', 'brought', 'life', 'representation', 'performances', 'characters', 'first', 'season', 'Two', 'Half', 'Men', 'far', 'winner', 'excellent', 'starting', 'place', 'one', 'funniest', 'most', 'popular', 'shows', 'television', 'period.To', 'make', 'things', 'even', 'better', 'first', 'season', 'Two', 'Half', 'Men', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'better', 'packaged', 'are', 'total', 'three', 'bonus', 'feautures', 'DVD', 'set', 'first', 'feauturette', 'Two', 'Adults', 'One', 'Kid', 'No', 'Grown-Ups', 'Go', 'Scenes', 'Cast', 'Crew', 'how', 'Two', 'Half', 'Men', 'began', 'scenes', 'show', 'production', 'providing', 'several', 'interesting', 'enjoying', 'facts', 'second', 'Backstage', 'Tour', 'Angus', 'T.', 'Jones', 'Angus', 'T.', 'Jones', 'giving', 'tour', 'set', 'Two', 'Half', 'Men', 'showing', 'how', 'filmed', 'what', 'life', 'set', 'then', 'have', 'Gag', 'Reel', 'several', 'memorable', 'hillarious', 'outtakes', 'filming', 'first', 'season', 'Two', 'Half', 'Men', 'Add', 'together', '***entire***', 'set', 'having', 'good', 'photographs', 'episodes', 'are', 'be', 'found', 'here', 'booklet', 'info', 'episodes', 'are', 'luck', 'first', 'season', 'DVD', 'Two', 'Half', 'Men', '.Even', 'just', 'watch', 'Two', 'Half', 'Men', 'occasionally', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'buy', 'DVD', 'perfect', 'way', 'sit', 'back', 'have', 'good', 'laugh', 'be', 'well', 'acquainted', 'Two', 'Half', 'Men', 'DVD', 'ever', 'represented', 'show', 'so', 'well']",TWO AND A HALF MEN: S1(DVD)
