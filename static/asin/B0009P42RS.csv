He was such a Heel that he attempted to engineer his own kidnapping to get out of paying a high divorce settlment, but he had pissed of a number of others to the extent that his estranged wife engineered  a plan to kidnap him to make sure that he doesnot get out of settlement.  He had passed over promoting his top administrator to being his assistant and gave the assistant position to his emptyheaded mistress.  The offended female worker engineered her own plot with two of her friends to kidnap him as well.  A fellow applying for a job at his company was pressured by his sister who had broken out of jail to get her $10,000  or she was going to tell the law that he was mastermind of the robbery that got her put away in prison,when this fellow applied to mr king for a job.  Anthony Anderson insulted him and turned him dow flat-this fellow engineered his own plot to kidnap him.  So there were four kidnap plots against this one obnoxious man.  The story took on a halarious turn when all of the kidnappers tripped over each other to kidnap the star.  Loretta Divine  kept the comedy alive as well.

Bernabo,"[1, 2]","Malcolm King (Anthony Anderson) has made millions despite the fact that he treats everybody at King Enterprises like dirt and thinks hiring a bimbo to run a key part of his company instead of someone pretends to have a whole bunch of college degrees is a good thing.  His dumb as a post girlfriend, Peaches Clarke (Regina Hall) apparently looks good next to his shrewish wife, Renee (Kellita Smith), and apparently he got his big mouth from his secretary, Miss Gladys (Loretta Devine), who is the only person on Earth who apparently can stand him.  Malcolm is in the middle of an ugly divorce and he is afraid Renee is going to get his fortune, so he decides to fake being kidnapped so he can keep the ransom money.  But then Renee decides she should kidnap Malcolm to make sure she gets his money, as does Angela Drake (Nicole Ari Parker), who lost out on the promotion to the aforementioned Peaches, and Corey (Jay Mohr) who is down on his luck and had his shoes insulted by Malcolm.Of course, in Wayne Conley's script all four of the kidnapping attempts happen at the same time.  Malcolm thinks he has been kidnapped by the people he wants to kidnap him, but that would make sense and that is not the direction this film wants to go.  Confusion certainly reigns, but really not as much comedy as you would like to see, most of which seems to be pretty heavy handed.  Besides, it is not like any of these characters are worth rooting for, which I find to be the fatal flaw of the film, so there is a basic apathy towards the entire plot.  I knew it was a bad sign when Malcolm's lunch order was pointed out because this was obviously going to be a clue that would come into play later in the film (yep, it sure did).  But then this is a movie that treats foot massage as a sublime sexual experience of the first order.Not only is ""King's Ransom"" a bad movie, there is so much of it.  The film runs two hours and then there are well over a half-hour of deleted scenes.  I suppose there are plenty of laughs, as long as you enjoy laughing at the characters rather than with them, but the more I watched this film the more I was impressed with ""Ruthless Person,"" a movie that I have not thought about in years but which is clearly a much better example of a kidnapping gone awry comedy.  You will also be thinking of movies like ""Kangaroo Jack,"" ""Barbershop,"" and ""Urban Legends,"" all of which made much better use of Anthony Anderson's talents in decidedly different ways.  Donald Faison and Charlie Murphy are also wasted in this lame 2005 comedy as well, which underscores the great chasm between the talent of the cast and the value of the script.",3,There is nobody to root for in this lame kidnapping comedy,1122854400,"08 1, 2005",2005,2650,"['Malcolm', 'King', 'Anthony', 'Anderson', 'made', 'millions', 'fact', 'everybody', 'King', 'Enterprises', 'dirt', 'hiring', 'bimbo', 'run', 'key', 'part', 'company', 'instead', 'someone', 'pretends', 'have', 'whole', 'bunch', 'college', 'degrees', 'good', 'thing', 'dumb', 'post', 'girlfriend', 'Peaches', 'Clarke', 'Regina', 'Hall', 'apparently', 'good', 'next', 'shrewish', 'wife', 'Renee', 'Kellita', 'Smith', 'apparently', 'got', 'big', 'mouth', 'secretary', 'Miss', 'Gladys', 'Loretta', 'Devine', 'who', 'only', 'person', 'Earth', 'who', 'apparently', 'can', 'stand', 'Malcolm', 'middle', 'ugly', 'divorce', 'afraid', 'Renee', 'going', 'get', 'fortune', 'fake', 'being', 'kidnapped', 'can', 'keep', 'ransom', 'money', 'then', 'Renee', 'should', 'kidnap', 'Malcolm', 'make', 'sure', 'money', 'Angela', 'Drake', 'Nicole', 'Ari', 'Parker', 'who', 'lost', 'out', 'promotion', 'aforementioned', 'Peaches', 'Corey', 'Jay', 'Mohr', 'who', 'down', 'luck', 'had', 'shoes', 'insulted', 'Malcolm.Of', 'course', 'Wayne', 'Conley', 'script', 'four', 'kidnapping', 'attempts', 'happen', 'same', 'time', 'Malcolm', 'been', 'kidnapped', 'people', 'kidnap', 'would', 'make', 'sense', 'not', 'direction', 'film', 'go', 'Confusion', 'certainly', 'really', 'not', 'much', 'comedy', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'most', 'be', 'pretty', 'heavy', 'handed', 'not', 'characters', 'are', 'worth', 'rooting', 'find', 'be', 'fatal', 'flaw', 'film', 'basic', 'apathy', 'entire', 'plot', 'knew', 'was', 'bad', 'sign', 'when', 'Malcolm', 'lunch', 'order', 'was', 'pointed', 'out', 'was', 'obviously', 'going', 'be', 'clue', 'would', 'come', 'play', 'later', 'film', 'yep', 'sure', 'did', 'then', 'movie', 'foot', 'massage', 'sublime', 'sexual', 'experience', 'first', 'order.Not', 'only', 'King', 'Ransom', 'bad', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'film', 'two', 'hours', 'then', 'are', 'well', 'half-hour', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'suppose', 'are', 'plenty', 'laughs', 'as', 'long', 'enjoy', 'laughing', 'characters', 'rather', 'more', 'watched', 'film', 'more', 'was', 'impressed', 'Ruthless', 'Person', 'movie', 'have', 'not', 'thought', 'years', 'clearly', 'much', 'better', 'example', 'kidnapping', 'gone', 'awry', 'comedy', 'will', 'also', 'be', 'thinking', 'movies', 'Kangaroo', 'Jack', 'Barbershop', 'Urban', 'Legends', 'made', 'much', 'better', 'use', 'Anthony', 'Anderson', 'talents', 'decidedly', 'different', 'ways', 'Donald', 'Faison', 'Charlie', 'Murphy', 'are', 'also', 'wasted', 'lame', '2005', 'comedy', 'well', 'great', 'chasm', 'talent', 'cast', 'value', 'script']",King's Ransom
