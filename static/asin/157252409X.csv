On the way I had the privilege of taking communion at Rev. Green's Full Force Tabernacle in Memphis and a long video interview with the Rev. Willie Morganfield (Muddy's cousin).This Robert Mugge documentary captured Green at his most contemplative and charismatic.

Ed. DVD by Acorn Media.The blend of information related to the rise and stardom of this popular performer of music is presented with the 1973 ""converted"", ""born-again"", ""forgiven"" (Al Green's own words) reformation of Green's drive and music toward gospel and preaching.This is a must for fans who remember and still enjoy the early music, like the ""Let's Stay Together"" beginning of his pop achievements which earned him financial success as well as many awards including a Grammy Lifetime Achievement (2002). This DVD offers a taping of the first use of the ""Let's Stay Together"" song, after years of refusal to perform those career-beginning love songs. Green had reverted in 1977 to only gospel songs after a song with the words ""it's you that I want but Him that I need"" convicted him to a total conversion in his music and ministry.  He was ""spiritually uplifted"" (again Green's words) to risk his career for Jesus Christ.In Oct. 1974, Green was scalded with hot grits, followed by his girlfriend/attacker committing suicide in his apartment. That event is discussed in the interview on this DVD, the first time he publicly talked of the happening, surprising even his band members. Greatly influenced, he bought a church in 1976, was ordained, and began preaching along with continuing of singing gospel.In this ""GOSPEL according to AL GREEN"", live footage of the 7th Anniversary Celebration of his church, Full Gospel Tabernacle, Memphis, is presented, including Greens sermon.  He preaches with his musical style attached to traditional southern-Black preaching.  This DVDs documentation and interview of Al Green shows him to be as sincere in his music and his faith as he is with his broad facial smile.Green's individualistic style of soul-pop-R&B-gospel-heavenly; fire inspired renditions to old hymns is included through the toe tappin', foot stompin' ""Amazing Grace"" number.Since the taping of the material on this 2009 25th Ann. Ed.; Al Green has returned to some popular music, the first being his joining in the song ""Put a Little Love in Your Heart"" from ""Scrooged."" Many of Green's songs could be sung to a lover, or to a loving Christ and God, with equal sincerity.DVD special features are listed in the description above, but the best is the ""Director Reflections."" Many other parts of this bonus section repeat segments but with in Audio Only. I found I enjoyed the video being included. Information for those requiring it: no subtitles or CC could be found.AL GREEN, born in 1946, saved in 1973, ordained in 1977, R&R; Hall of Fame in 1995, is still recording in 2009. And preaching. Get a taste of both with this DVD, already labeled by the press, ""Marvelous"" ""Transcendent"" ""A Must-see"" ""Extraordinary"" ""Powerful"" ""Electricity"" and ""A Revelation.""Guaranteed, you will know Al Green better than before after viewing this DVD.

187371,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,157252409X,Stephanie De Pue,"[8, 8]","""Gospel according to Al Green,"" is a long-awaited 25th anniversary edition of the television profile by Robert Mugge. The DVD documentary, originally televised in 1984, has been shown on PBS stations, BET, and at various festivals.  It offers a candid, close look at Green, one of the few remaining candidates for King of Soul who's still with us today.  (And one of the few who could give James Brown a run for his money as the hardest-working man in show business.) It shows the performer in the recording studio, in performance at Bolling Air Force base, and preaching at the church he founded in Memphis, Tennessee. This reissue also offers a 90-minute audio interview with the singer, and several other special features.Green is a nine-time Grammy winner, and member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame; he's recorded more than 40 albums.  He recently released a new CD,Lay It Down, and received the BET Lifetime Achievement Award (2008).  He was a 1970's soul singer with a healthy career, built on ""Let's Stay Together"" and other hits, until he awoke one morning in a hotel room hungry for religion, and so became a gospel singer and Pentecostal preacher.  The singer has a non-stop, whiter than white-toothed smile, a bedrock of honesty, and a galvanizing energy, and he sweats up a storm, whether in concert or preaching, which he does in speech-to-music, and song - looks to me like he literally invented rap.  On this DVD, we see his electrifying takes of ""Let's Stay Together,"" ""Free at Last,"" and ""Amazing Grace.""Mugge has been called ""the king of the American music documentary"" by ""L.A. Weekly."" The award-winning filmmaker has also madeNew Orleans Music in Exile; andSaxophone Colossus.Many years ago, during my English exile, I was lying on the floor of the cottage, listening to Otis Redding, when Tony Burfield, the pompous young music business flunky who lived next door, came in.  Burfield told me that the floor was meant ""to walk upon and stand upon, not to lie upon,"" and that I was dating myself listening to Redding; that those in the know were now listening to Green, and I've never forgiven him. But I've long since forgiven Green: the man just has an amazing way with him.",5,The Amazing Grace of Al Green,1232064000,"01 16, 2009",2009,2199,"['Gospel', 'according', 'Al', 'Green', 'long-awaited', '25th', 'anniversary', 'edition', 'television', 'profile', 'Robert', 'Mugge', 'DVD', 'documentary', 'originally', 'televised', '1984', 'been', 'shown', 'PBS', 'stations', 'BET', 'various', 'festivals', 'candid', 'close', 'look', 'Green', 'one', 'few', 'remaining', 'candidates', 'King', 'Soul', 'who', 'still', 'today', 'one', 'few', 'who', 'could', 'give', 'James', 'Brown', 'run', 'money', 'hardest-working', 'man', 'show', 'business', 'performer', 'recording', 'studio', 'performance', 'Bolling', 'Air', 'Force', 'base', 'preaching', 'church', 'founded', 'Memphis', 'Tennessee', 'reissue', 'also', '90-minute', 'audio', 'interview', 'singer', 'several', 'other', 'special', 'features.Green', 'nine-time', 'Grammy', 'winner', 'member', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'Hall', 'Fame', 'recorded', 'more', '40', 'albums', 'recently', 'released', 'new', 'CD', 'Lay', 'Down', 'received', 'BET', 'Lifetime', 'Achievement', 'Award', '2008', 'was', '1970', 'soul', 'singer', 'healthy', 'career', 'built', 'Let', 'Stay', 'Together', 'other', 'hits', 'awoke', 'one', 'morning', 'hotel', 'room', 'hungry', 'religion', 'so', 'became', 'gospel', 'singer', 'Pentecostal', 'preacher', 'singer', 'non-stop', 'whiter', 'white-toothed', 'smile', 'bedrock', 'honesty', 'galvanizing', 'energy', 'up', 'storm', 'concert', 'preaching', 'speech-to-music', 'song', 'literally', 'invented', 'rap', 'DVD', 'see', 'electrifying', 'Let', 'Stay', 'Together', 'Free', 'Last', 'Amazing', 'Grace', 'Mugge', 'been', 'called', 'king', 'American', 'music', 'documentary', 'L.A', 'Weekly', 'award-winning', 'filmmaker', 'also', 'madeNew', 'Orleans', 'Music', 'Exile', 'andSaxophone', 'Colossus.Many', 'years', 'ago', 'English', 'exile', 'was', 'lying', 'floor', 'cottage', 'listening', 'Otis', 'Redding', 'when', 'Tony', 'Burfield', 'pompous', 'young', 'music', 'business', 'flunky', 'who', 'lived', 'next', 'door', 'came', 'Burfield', 'told', 'floor', 'was', 'meant', 'walk', 'stand', 'upon', 'not', 'lie', 'upon', 'was', 'dating', 'listening', 'Redding', 'know', 'were', 'now', 'listening', 'Green', ""'ve"", 'never', 'forgiven', ""'ve"", 'long', 'forgiven', 'Green', 'man', 'just', 'amazing', 'way']",N/A
