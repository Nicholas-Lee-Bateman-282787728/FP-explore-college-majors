788169,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0000WN1NG,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 4]","I had heard lots of wonderful things about `Melvin and Howard', mostly from my cinephile friends who considered it a classic example of quirky 80's comedy and thought that it was one of the best films of that particular decade.  Yes, heavy praise indeed.  Tack on that the fact that a lot of people consider Steenburgen's Oscar win to be one of the best in the category and you have a film that I was dying to see for quite some time.  I finally nestled into it the other night, and I must say that I was floored to the fact that I didn't like it, hardly at all.`Melvin and Howard' is a semi-true story about a man who happened to stumble across Howard Hughes and, remarkably, wound up in his will.  Whether that really happened or not isn't the point; allegedly it did.  The film opens with an overlong car ride where Melvin, a down on his luck milkman, picks up a man he assumes is a bum and gives him a lift.  The man claims to be Howard Hughes and Melvin thinks he's crazy.  That said, they have a nice conversation, Melvin pressures him into singing a Christmas song he wrote and then he gives him a quarter and he leaves.  Melvin goes back to his life, which is all over the place (I'll get to that in a second) and eventually finds out that he was named a beneficiary in Howard Hughes' will.  Problem is, no one believes him.So here is my problem with this film; it has no structural narrative.  A friend of mine told me that I was looking at the film wrong, that it was not meant to be viewed as a structured story because it was more a character study of one man's life and personality.  He said that real lives rarely have convenient narrative arcs and so I shouldn't look for them in this film.Sorry, but I can't get behind that much.  I mean, the constant narrative shifts here completely overwhelmed the film.  It made the film seem nonsensical, rushed and unfocused.  Instead of allowing us to soak in a situation the film just jumps around so much it feels like a hodgepodge of random scenes spliced together with not lyrical structure.  The performances are mostly fine.  Paul Le Mat is pretty great as Melvin, and Mary Steenburgen is wonderful as his embittered wife.  I felt that the rushed editing and the poor screenplay made her look like an idiot for most of the film, but she found a way to balance her ambitions and her naivety in a way that made her feel whole, despite the deconstructed feel of the film itself.  Jason Robards is fine, I guess, but I'll never understand that Oscar nomination.  He basically grumbled for three minutes and sang a song.  He has two scenes (sure, he bookends the film) but really, the film isn't at all interested in him.Which brings up another complaint; why is a film about a man who claims to be on Howard Hughes will give the actual claim a minimal amount of attention?  I mean, the claim itself is given like three scenes, maybe fifteen minutes.  The bulk of the film is NOT about that situation at all.  Every review talks about `how Melvin handles the situation' as being some major plot point, but it's not; at all.Meh, this film is just bad.Alas, Steenburgen was a respectable Oscar winner, especially in that horrid lineup, but she isn't enough to make me suggest this film to anyone.",2,What the...,1337558400,"05 21, 2012",2012,3251,"['had', 'heard', 'lots', 'wonderful', 'things', 'Melvin', 'Howard', 'mostly', 'cinephile', 'friends', 'who', 'considered', 'classic', 'example', '80', 'comedy', 'thought', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'particular', 'decade', 'Yes', 'heavy', 'praise', 'indeed', 'Tack', 'fact', 'lot', 'people', 'consider', 'Steenburgen', 'Oscar', 'win', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'category', 'have', 'film', 'was', 'dying', 'see', 'quite', 'time', 'finally', 'nestled', 'other', 'night', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'floored', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'hardly', 'all.', 'Melvin', 'Howard', 'semi-true', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'happened', 'stumble', 'Howard', 'Hughes', 'remarkably', 'wound', 'up', 'will', 'Whether', 'really', 'happened', 'not', ""n't"", 'point', 'allegedly', 'did', 'film', 'overlong', 'car', 'ride', 'where', 'Melvin', 'down', 'luck', 'milkman', 'up', 'man', 'bum', 'lift', 'man', 'be', 'Howard', 'Hughes', 'Melvin', 'crazy', 'said', 'have', 'nice', 'conversation', 'Melvin', 'singing', 'Christmas', 'song', 'wrote', 'then', 'quarter', 'Melvin', 'back', 'life', 'place', ""'ll"", 'get', 'second', 'eventually', 'out', 'was', 'named', 'beneficiary', 'Howard', 'Hughes', 'will', 'Problem', 'one', 'him.So', 'here', 'problem', 'film', 'structural', 'narrative', 'friend', 'mine', 'told', 'was', 'looking', 'film', 'wrong', 'was', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'viewed', 'structured', 'story', 'was', 'more', 'character', 'study', 'one', 'man', 'life', 'personality', 'said', 'real', 'lives', 'rarely', 'have', 'convenient', 'narrative', 'arcs', 'so', 'should', ""n't"", 'look', 'film.Sorry', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'mean', 'constant', 'narrative', 'shifts', 'here', 'completely', 'overwhelmed', 'film', 'made', 'film', 'seem', 'nonsensical', 'rushed', 'unfocused', 'Instead', 'allowing', 'soak', 'situation', 'film', 'just', 'jumps', 'around', 'so', 'much', 'hodgepodge', 'random', 'scenes', 'spliced', 'together', 'not', 'lyrical', 'structure', 'performances', 'are', 'mostly', 'fine', 'Paul', 'Le', 'Mat', 'pretty', 'great', 'Melvin', 'Mary', 'Steenburgen', 'wonderful', 'embittered', 'wife', 'felt', 'rushed', 'editing', 'poor', 'screenplay', 'made', 'look', 'idiot', 'most', 'film', 'found', 'way', 'balance', 'ambitions', 'naivety', 'way', 'made', 'feel', 'whole', 'deconstructed', 'feel', 'film', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'fine', 'guess', ""'ll"", 'never', 'understand', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'basically', 'grumbled', 'three', 'minutes', 'sang', 'song', 'two', 'scenes', 'sure', 'film', 'really', 'film', ""n't"", 'interested', 'him.Which', 'up', 'complaint', 'why', 'film', 'man', 'who', 'be', 'Howard', 'Hughes', 'will', 'give', 'actual', 'claim', 'minimal', 'amount', 'attention', 'mean', 'claim', 'given', 'three', 'scenes', 'maybe', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'bulk', 'film', 'NOT', 'situation', 'Every', 'review', 'talks', 'how', 'Melvin', 'situation', 'being', 'major', 'plot', 'point', 'not', 'all.Meh', 'film', 'just', 'bad.Alas', 'Steenburgen', 'was', 'respectable', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'especially', 'horrid', 'lineup', ""n't"", 'enough', 'make', 'suggest', 'film', 'anyone']",N/A

788171,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,B0000WN1NG,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[22, 23]","Directed by Jonathan Demme, Melvin and Howard (1980) tells the supposedly true story of Melvin E. Dummar, a man who may have had a chance encounter with the late multi-billionaire recluse Howard Hughes before his death, and Dummar's inclusion into Hughes' will.Demme, who also directed Something Wild (1986) and Silence of the Lambs (1991) does a wonderful job of relating the story of Melvin (Paul Le Mat) and how he came across Howard Hughes (Jason Robards) stranded in the desert outside of Las Vegas and gave him a ride.  Hughes, looking disheveled and grisly, stated that he was who he was, but Melvin didn't take him seriously, thinking he was just some old wino.Some time goes by, Howard Hughes passes away, and a mysterious stranger leaves a handwritten letter in Melvin's gas station.  The document, which appears to be Hughes will, names Melvin as a beneficiary, entitling him to somewhere in the neighborhood of $156 million dollars.  Well, this immediately launches Melvin into the public spotlight and focuses much attention on the validity of the will.While the movie is titled Melvin and Howard, it's mostly about Melvin, and deals with his many ups and downs (mostly downs) in a particular period of his life.  Melvin switches jobs a few times, working as a magnesium bagger, milk truck driver, and gas station owner, and deals with personal problems like his wife leaving, cars repossessed, being in debt up to his ears...Paul Le Mat, who many may recognize as John Milner from American Graffiti (1973) is wonderful as the poor but likeable schlub who, due to his natural good nature, may have found himself in a position to inherit millions.  The supporting cast is great including Robards, Dabney Coleman, John Glover, Pamela Reed, and Mary Steenburgen, who won an academy award for best supporting actress as Melvin's wife, Lynda.  The real Melvin E. Dummar even makes an appearance as a counter clerk at a bus terminal.  And speaking of academy awards, it should also be noted that Bo Goldman won the award for best writing for this film.There are no special features on this release, only a trailer, but the picture looks wonderful in the wide screen format.  There is another release, one from Anchor Bay Entertainment that does include some more extras like commentary and production notes not available here, so if you are interested in those kinds of things, you might want to search it out.  Does Melvin get the money in the end?  It doesn't really matter, at least not in the scope of this film.  I highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys good filmmaking and is interesting in discovering an under-appreciated movie with great scripting, casting, dialogue, direction, and music.  Everything clicks really well in this little 'slice of life' gem.Cookieman108",4,"&quot;C'mon old timer, sing me a song...&quot;",1078444800,"03 5, 2004",2004,2793,"['Directed', 'Jonathan', 'Demme', 'Melvin', 'Howard', '1980', 'supposedly', 'true', 'story', 'Melvin', 'E.', 'Dummar', 'man', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'chance', 'encounter', 'late', 'multi-billionaire', 'recluse', 'Howard', 'Hughes', 'death', 'Dummar', 'inclusion', 'Hughes', 'will.Demme', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'Something', 'Wild', '1986', 'Silence', 'Lambs', '1991', 'wonderful', 'job', 'relating', 'story', 'Melvin', 'Paul', 'Le', 'Mat', 'how', 'came', 'Howard', 'Hughes', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'stranded', 'desert', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'gave', 'ride', 'Hughes', 'looking', 'disheveled', 'grisly', 'stated', 'was', 'who', 'was', 'Melvin', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'seriously', 'thinking', 'was', 'just', 'old', 'wino.Some', 'time', 'Howard', 'Hughes', 'away', 'mysterious', 'stranger', 'handwritten', 'letter', 'Melvin', 'gas', 'station', 'document', 'be', 'Hughes', 'will', 'names', 'Melvin', 'beneficiary', 'entitling', 'somewhere', 'neighborhood', '156', 'million', 'dollars', 'Well', 'immediately', 'Melvin', 'public', 'spotlight', 'much', 'attention', 'validity', 'will.While', 'movie', 'titled', 'Melvin', 'Howard', 'mostly', 'Melvin', 'deals', 'many', 'ups', 'downs', 'mostly', 'particular', 'period', 'life', 'Melvin', 'jobs', 'few', 'times', 'working', 'magnesium', 'bagger', 'milk', 'truck', 'driver', 'gas', 'station', 'owner', 'deals', 'personal', 'problems', 'wife', 'leaving', 'cars', 'repossessed', 'being', 'debt', 'ears', 'Paul', 'Le', 'Mat', 'who', 'many', 'may', 'recognize', 'John', 'Milner', 'American', 'Graffiti', '1973', 'wonderful', 'poor', 'likeable', 'schlub', 'who', 'due', 'natural', 'good', 'nature', 'may', 'have', 'found', 'position', 'inherit', 'millions', 'supporting', 'cast', 'great', 'including', 'Robards', 'Dabney', 'Coleman', 'John', 'Glover', 'Pamela', 'Reed', 'Mary', 'Steenburgen', 'who', 'won', 'academy', 'award', 'best', 'supporting', 'actress', 'Melvin', 'wife', 'Lynda', 'real', 'Melvin', 'E.', 'Dummar', 'even', 'appearance', 'counter', 'clerk', 'bus', 'terminal', 'speaking', 'academy', 'awards', 'should', 'also', 'be', 'noted', 'Bo', 'Goldman', 'won', 'award', 'best', 'writing', 'are', 'special', 'features', 'release', 'only', 'trailer', 'picture', 'wonderful', 'wide', 'screen', 'format', 'release', 'one', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'Entertainment', 'include', 'more', 'extras', 'commentary', 'production', 'notes', 'not', 'available', 'here', 'so', 'are', 'interested', 'kinds', 'things', 'might', 'want', 'search', 'out', 'Does', 'Melvin', 'get', 'money', 'end', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'least', 'not', 'scope', 'film', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'good', 'filmmaking', 'interesting', 'discovering', 'under-appreciated', 'movie', 'great', 'scripting', 'casting', 'dialogue', 'direction', 'music', 'Everything', 'clicks', 'really', 'well', 'little', ""'slice"", 'life', 'gem.Cookieman108']",N/A
788172,A315K47GRB024C,B0000WN1NG,Daniel C. Markel,"[4, 4]","This review is for the Universal DVD released in 2004.The movie begins with Melvin Dummar (Paul Le Mat) accidentally finding an injured old man (Jason Robards) out in the cold Nevada desert.  The haggardly old man convinces Melvin to drive him to Las Vegas and during the long drive, the old curmudgeon tells Melvin that he is Howard Hughes.  Melvin is skeptical of the claim and even more so when the old man panhandles some pocket change from Melvin at the end of the trip.  Later that morning Melvin returns to his mobile home somewhere in rural Nevada and later that day his pickup truck and motorcycle are repossessed.  This apparently is the straw that breaks the camel's back for Melvin's wife Lynda (Mary Steenburgen) and she leaves him for another man.  This sets up the rest of the movie where both Howard Hughes and Lynda are far from gone from Melvin's life.The movie is supposedly based on a true story.  The debatable issue is if Melvin Dummar really did meet and save billionaire Howard Hughes and did Hughes return the favor years later after he died by leaving Dummar 1/16th of his estate in a dubious hand-written will.  The movie's goal isn't really trying to prove the veracity of the Hughes events.  The story is in essence about a hardworking blue-collar guy who gets a few big breaks, in fact one potentially colossal break, and a few smaller breaks dropped in his lap, but in all cases does a seemingly poor job in handling them.  Melvin is likable and earnest, but instead of taking charge of life, it seems that life takes charge of him.  The movie is also a wonderful snapshot of lower middle class life in the later part of the `70's.  There's a great scene in a gaudy Las Vegas wedding chapel, and later they participate in an outrageously artificial TV game show.  It also had that unmistakable `70's aura of pursuing the American dream with ostentatious wealth such as a brand new, but cheaply constructed and unoriginal suburban house, an enormous Cadillac convertible, a monstrosity of a motorboat and a mammoth-size console TV.  You also get your fill of some of the more comical and obnoxious country & western songs from that era.  The charm of the movie is that when things go wrong, Melvin picks himself up, keeps his chin up, doesn't seem at all bitter, tries again tomorrow and nobody can take away his wonderful memories from yesterday.  I don't recall a single moment in the film being laugh-out-loud funny, but just about every scene put a smile on my face. But overall for me, it wasn't a great film, but a very good one.As for the DVD, it's a nice widescreen color presentation.  The opening shot seemed noticeably grainy, and the rest of the movie had just average resolution and sharpness with no film defects.  I've seen much sharper DVDs from late `70's films, but on the other hand, the comparative slight loss in sharpness made it look and feel like a cheap late 1970's film, true to the characters of the movie itself.  The audio is excellent.  The only bonus the original trailer.Movie: BDVD Quality: B+",4,"An offbeat, small treasure of a film and possibly true!",1123718400,"08 11, 2005",2005,3056,"['review', 'Universal', 'DVD', 'released', '2004.The', 'movie', 'Melvin', 'Dummar', 'Paul', 'Le', 'Mat', 'accidentally', 'finding', 'injured', 'old', 'man', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'out', 'cold', 'Nevada', 'desert', 'haggardly', 'old', 'man', 'Melvin', 'drive', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'long', 'drive', 'old', 'curmudgeon', 'Melvin', 'Howard', 'Hughes', 'Melvin', 'skeptical', 'claim', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'when', 'old', 'man', 'pocket', 'change', 'Melvin', 'end', 'trip', 'Later', 'morning', 'Melvin', 'mobile', 'home', 'somewhere', 'rural', 'Nevada', 'later', 'day', 'pickup', 'truck', 'motorcycle', 'are', 'repossessed', 'apparently', 'straw', 'camel', 'back', 'Melvin', 'wife', 'Lynda', 'Mary', 'Steenburgen', 'man', 'up', 'rest', 'movie', 'where', 'Howard', 'Hughes', 'Lynda', 'are', 'far', 'gone', 'Melvin', 'life.The', 'movie', 'supposedly', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'debatable', 'issue', 'Melvin', 'Dummar', 'really', 'did', 'meet', 'save', 'billionaire', 'Howard', 'Hughes', 'did', 'Hughes', 'return', 'favor', 'years', 'later', 'died', 'leaving', 'Dummar', '1/16th', 'estate', 'dubious', 'hand-written', 'will', 'movie', 'goal', ""n't"", 'really', 'trying', 'prove', 'veracity', 'Hughes', 'events', 'story', 'essence', 'hardworking', 'blue-collar', 'guy', 'who', 'few', 'big', 'breaks', 'fact', 'one', 'potentially', 'colossal', 'break', 'few', 'smaller', 'breaks', 'dropped', 'lap', 'cases', 'seemingly', 'poor', 'job', 'handling', 'Melvin', 'likable', 'earnest', 'instead', 'taking', 'charge', 'life', 'life', 'charge', 'movie', 'also', 'wonderful', 'snapshot', 'lower', 'middle', 'class', 'life', 'later', 'part', '70', 'great', 'scene', 'gaudy', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'wedding', 'chapel', 'later', 'participate', 'outrageously', 'artificial', 'TV', 'game', 'show', 'also', 'had', 'unmistakable', '70', 'aura', 'pursuing', 'American', 'dream', 'ostentatious', 'wealth', 'such', 'brand', 'new', 'cheaply', 'constructed', 'unoriginal', 'suburban', 'house', 'enormous', 'Cadillac', 'convertible', 'monstrosity', 'motorboat', 'mammoth-size', 'console', 'TV', 'also', 'get', 'fill', 'more', 'comical', 'obnoxious', 'country', 'western', 'songs', 'era', 'charm', 'movie', 'when', 'things', 'go', 'wrong', 'Melvin', 'up', 'chin', 'up', ""n't"", 'seem', 'bitter', 'tries', 'again', 'tomorrow', 'nobody', 'can', 'take', 'away', 'wonderful', 'memories', 'yesterday', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'single', 'moment', 'film', 'being', 'laugh-out-loud', 'funny', 'just', 'scene', 'put', 'smile', 'face', 'overall', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'one.As', 'DVD', 'nice', 'widescreen', 'color', 'presentation', 'opening', 'shot', 'seemed', 'noticeably', 'grainy', 'rest', 'movie', 'had', 'just', 'average', 'resolution', 'sharpness', 'film', 'defects', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'much', 'sharper', 'DVDs', 'late', '70', 'films', 'other', 'hand', 'comparative', 'slight', 'loss', 'sharpness', 'made', 'look', 'feel', 'cheap', 'late', '1970', 'film', 'true', 'characters', 'movie', 'audio', 'excellent', 'only', 'original', 'trailer.Movie', 'BDVD', 'Quality', 'B+']",N/A

788175,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0000WN1NG,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[4, 5]","I recently picked up a copy of ""Melvin and Howard,"" a picture that I remembered fondly from many years ago--to be pleasantly rewarded once again by its subtle, yet unmistakable charms.  Even though this movie was warmly regarded upon it's release, it's not a film I would characterize as ever having been immensely popular.  Despite being directed by Jonathan Demme, who went on to many great films including ""Silence of the Lambs,"" and despite Oscars for Mary Steenburgen and its screenplay--it's a film I feel has been largely forgotten.It's unfortunate, because I think ""Melvin and Howard"" is a terrific film based on a fascinating true life incident.  It has a real indie sensibility about it, a smallness, an attention to slice-of-life drama, a richness in detail.  Today, I really don't believe this would have been a studio film.  For such a BIG story, this is a little (but rich) comedy.Essentially, the plot follows the adventures of Melvin Dummar--a small town loser.  Melvin claims to have once given a ride to billionaire Howard Hughes and upon Hughes' death claimed to have a will naming him heir to the Hughes' fortune.  Of course, this becomes scrutinized and debated.  Is the story true?  Are the papers valid?  And although these events are based on fact, the films plays out as a smart satire on the nature of greed and asks us to determine what qualities in life make us the richest.Paul Le Mat, an interesting actor, has his best role here as Melvin.  Jason Robards plays, very briefly, as the man who may or may not be Hughes (a few minutes was enough to garner him an Oscar nomination).  And Mary Steenburgen is a riot as Melvin's first wife.  She swept most of the major awards that year, hers is a deft comedic performance reminiscent of a young Jean Arthur.  This is a MUST for her fans.There's a lot of joy to be had in this small picture, and I definitely want to recommend it.  It's a sophisticated telling, as well.  It never purports to advance what is true or not--and that'll leave you with a smile and some good discussion points when the film ends.

Okay, I cheered for Paul Le Mat, playing Melvin .... wanting the courts to find in his favor.  But even though that fell through, the movie is entertaining, and a great watch.  Everytime I hear Bye Bye Blackbird, I think of Jason Robards and Paul Le Mat in the truck heading for Vegas.  (Like 'sitting on the ritz', reminds me of Young frankenstein.)  A great comedy film, that personally I don't think you can watch without cheering for Melvin .... he's a likable ordinary Joe ... like all of us, so why shouldn't he inherit part of Howard Hughes estate?And then to see the sweet Back to the Future school marm, Mary Steenburgen topless / nude .... that was the top of the toppata's ....

She normally plays the harried wife in various comedies, but this role is strictly Utah trailer trash, and it is delicious.  Her husband, Melvin the Milk Man of the Year can't keep a job, so she goes off to make a living anyway she can, shuffling her ten year old daughter off to Melvin. Melvin divorces her, takes her back and she's off again mostly because Melvin spends like a drunken sailor.  Paul LeMat had a number of likable fool roles in the late 70's and early 80's.  He's chewing gum and singing cowboy songs while they repo his vehicles.  A chance meeting with the legendary Howard Hughes, millionaire in the desert is the plot device that propels this cute little film.Sure, downtrodden folks dream of hitting the lottery or inheriting money from an unknown relative, but it is possible that a desperate man in real life, Melvin Dummar, may have forged himself into Hugh's will, but I doubt it.  How did he duplicate Hugh's handwriting?

In this film, Melvin E. Dummar picks up an older hitch hiker in the American Southwets. The first twenty minutes of the film is about the ride between Robards and Paul LeMat who played likable Melvin Dummar. During this strange encounter, Melvin doesn't believe it's Howard Hughes in his truck. During their ride, he treats him like a human being without asking questions. In the beginning, Melvin encourages him to see a doctor in the neighboring town but he doesn't want too. He wants to go to Las Vegas and that is where Dummar drops him off on the Strip even giving him his last few cents.When he drops him off, Howard drops the money into the homeless sleeping on the street. It's possible that it really was Howard Hughes, the eccentric legendary entrepreneur. Melvin returns home to his trailer where he is broke and living with his wife, Lynda, and their daughter, Darci. His wife, Lynda, is played by the fabulous Mary Steenburgen who won an Academy Award for Supporting Actress in this role. The Dummars aren't rich to say the least. They have financial problems. Melvin works hard to support his family. When Lynda moves Darci to live with her mother in Los Angeles, she gets to win on a game show in one of the highlighted films. The cast is pretty terrific especially Paul LeMat who played Melvin in the role.I wished the DVD version would have included a mention of the true story behind the movie. I was surprised that it was based on actual events and people. I thought it was fiction until the end. The DVD could have added the making and behind the scenes or making of the film which was shot on location in California, Utah, and Nevada. Even Mary Steenburgen's Academy Award isn't mention on the DVD package as well, the film also won an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.",3,An Unlikely Encounter Leads to Fortune!,1363046400,"03 12, 2013",2013,1965,"['Jason', 'Robards', 'should', 'have', 'earned', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'performance', 'possibly', 'late', 'eccentric', 'billionaire', 'Howard', 'Hughes', 'film', 'Melvin', 'E.', 'Dummar', 'up', 'older', 'hitch', 'hiker', 'American', 'Southwets', 'first', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'film', 'ride', 'Robards', 'Paul', 'LeMat', 'who', 'played', 'likable', 'Melvin', 'Dummar', 'strange', 'encounter', 'Melvin', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Howard', 'Hughes', 'truck', 'ride', 'human', 'being', 'asking', 'questions', 'beginning', 'Melvin', 'see', 'doctor', 'neighboring', 'town', ""n't"", 'want', 'too', 'go', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'where', 'Dummar', 'off', 'Strip', 'even', 'giving', 'last', 'few', 'cents.When', 'off', 'Howard', 'money', 'homeless', 'sleeping', 'street', 'possible', 'really', 'was', 'Howard', 'Hughes', 'eccentric', 'legendary', 'entrepreneur', 'Melvin', 'home', 'trailer', 'where', 'broke', 'living', 'wife', 'Lynda', 'daughter', 'Darci', 'wife', 'Lynda', 'played', 'fabulous', 'Mary', 'Steenburgen', 'who', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'role', 'Dummars', 'are', ""n't"", 'rich', 'say', 'least', 'have', 'financial', 'problems', 'Melvin', 'hard', 'support', 'family', 'When', 'Lynda', 'Darci', 'live', 'mother', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'win', 'game', 'show', 'one', 'highlighted', 'films', 'cast', 'pretty', 'terrific', 'especially', 'Paul', 'LeMat', 'who', 'played', 'Melvin', 'role.I', 'wished', 'DVD', 'version', 'would', 'have', 'included', 'mention', 'true', 'story', 'movie', 'was', 'surprised', 'was', 'based', 'actual', 'events', 'people', 'thought', 'was', 'fiction', 'end', 'DVD', 'could', 'have', 'added', 'making', 'scenes', 'making', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'location', 'California', 'Utah', 'Nevada', 'Even', 'Mary', 'Steenburgen', 'Academy', 'Award', ""n't"", 'mention', 'DVD', 'package', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'also', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Original', 'Screenplay']",N/A
