This movie has two major strengths going for it: 1- The characters, though in a panic, are not stupid, and come up w/ some innovative ideas in order to escape / survive. 2- There's a central theme of humanity within the carnage-filled chaos, making things more believable and heart-breaking, not just shocking.

1423543,A3GKMQFL05Z79K,B004PFOGJ2,blackaciddevil,"[0, 1]","Another day, another zombie movie, lol. Seriously, though, I've only purchased one of the Bloody Disgusting Selects movies(i.e.Exit Humanity) but was so impressed with it that I figured that my next one would be even better. Well, my figuring ended up in some disappointment.Rammbock: Berlin Undead tells the story of Michael, a guy who goes to Berlin to see his girlfriend: Gabi. Yet, when he gets there, a terrible virus starts spreading across the city turning people into mindless zombies. Thankfully, Gabi isn't home. There, he meets Harper. Together, He and Harper must face off against zombies that have surrounded the apartment building. It's going to take all the wits about them and then some to make their way out to find Gabi.I think what disappointed me the most was the fact that the movie was way too short. Course, you can look at other reviews here and tell I'm not the only one who felt that way. Second, it isn't as gory as most zombie movies are yet that makes things more creepy and effective I suppose. Third, it doesn't try to be original. The only area where they were original was with the storyline. Everything else is pretty much typical zombie-fare. Lastly, the movie feels like it isn't complete. You know, like there's more story to be told even though the end pretty much leaves things there.What I did like most about the movie was its' humanity. Those little moments that mirrored real life in the movie, even though this unnatural thing was happening. Touching moments.While it isn't a complete waste of time for a zombie movie, it doesn't have alot of redeeming qualities to it that would make me want to recommend it to everyone. Don't get me wrong, I liked the movie. Even though it's a lowbudgeter, you couldn't really tell. It should tide over zombie fans looking for something to sink their teeth into. Just don't expect the Earth to move with this movie.

1423545,A2TJOYIPDU6E5Q,B004PFOGJ2,damgrunt,"[2, 4]","There were times when i thought this movie could have been saved. i really feel as if they intention of this movie was to give the viewer the hope of seeing an enjoyable film and then steal that hope away with bad acting, bad character decisions, bad plot decisions, and bad zombie weakness.First complaint is the acting. i have never wanted to punch a main character more than i did while watching this movie. He really did complain about the weakest of topics while he sat idly as the world was collapsing around him. i watched this movie with two friends and we made fun of the main character most of the time. Just way too whiny for my taste. he prevented me from giving the movie hope at all.Character decisions is next. the smartest and bravest guy in the whole movie, was the jacked dude who hung himself right before he turned. that should tell you something about the characters of the film. The sad pouty ex-boyfriend looking for his Ex, who dumped him along time ago, but he's still in love and sad, while being sad, and pouty, with more sad. It was such crap acting and I really felt like he should've been asking when he could feed the rabbits. (&#34;Of Mice and Men&#34;). the jerk sissy from across the way that shouts out ideas that he wants others to try because he's too scared. The husband that wants to off himself because of his wife, the ex gf who feels bad, but not bad enough to do anything about it. pretty much every character in the whole movie had an awful role. The handy man's helper did a pretty good job at acting though, so 1 point for him.Poor plot decisions come from the bad character decisions. Much like the cliche falling down while running away, opening the door without checking the peep, running upstairs, or sticking with the dumb guy, this movie had the equivelant just in different form. the only person that didn't perish from their own doing was the brother and sister, and the jerk. Everyone else killed themselves for ridiculous reason and in ridiculous ways. they seriously should've put a gun in their mouths and saved me 45 minutes.Zombie afraid of flashing lights?.... really?

1423550,A29TKSIWA3JKF3,B004PFOGJ2,Einsatz,"[12, 13]","I don't know if it's a good thing or not, but it felt like this movie was a lot longer than 63 minutes.  I didn't realize it was that short until after watching the movie.  As for its length being an issue, that was standard practice in the 30s through the 50s; it helped with double features, a short, and a cartoon on the billing if movies were kept to shorter viewing times.  If it's a good movie, what difference does it make how long it is?I am a fan of this genre and as such, I try to watch every zombie movie that comes to DVD.I loved the DVD cover, when I saw it I just had to buy it.  Is it a fair representation of what the movie is like?  Not really.  The movie was seen less at eye level than is depicted on the cover; it's an interesting perspective to take for a zombie movie.  Most of the story takes place in confined spaces: an apartment complex with a courtyard.  The two main characters go from one confined area to another (despite what it says on the DVD case; they could neither hide nor run).  In that sense, they did a good job.  These zombies are like a pack of wolves chasing them from room to room, apartment to apartment, ever upward, into an attic then the rooftop.  How can you truly run from an infection?This is basically a two character story involving an average lovelorn dolt named Michael and a very resourceful plumber's assistant, Harper.  It starts quietly enough, a bit of sad comedy, yells, gunshots.  The epidemic hits a plumber first then suddenly the building is full of them.  From that point on things escalate, as would be expected, as it happens in most zombie flicks.  The only difference here is the brief glimpses of humanity in confusion, neighbors conversing through open windows high above the courtyard that rapidly fills with zombies.

1423552,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B004PFOGJ2,Eric Sanberg,"[0, 1]","This 64 minute 'walking dead' flick from Germany takes a bit from here and a bit form there and slices and dices them into a satisfying, if not quite original, whole.Here's the scoop. A guy goes to his ex-girl's apartment to return her keys. The two are history and he's broken up about it. While in her complex, he goes to her apartment to find she's not there, but two workmen are. One goes zombie-fied and tries to kill him. The young assistant intervenes and the two find themselves in survivalist mode as the complex is overrun by more zombies.This movie does induce some of the horror found in ""Night of the Living Dead"" along with that movie's attempts of the protagonists to survive in an enclosed space. It also aims at delving into the human side of things as depicted in ""The Walking Dead"" series. This is all done in a nice, neat little package. It's set in a multi-story complex so the shut-ins can see and communicate with each other out of windows facing each other across the courtyard. They are neighbors who know and care for each other. They're not just a faceless lot of zombie fodder. Our hero is a decent sort. He wants to get out of course, but he puts himself in harm's way to help others. He's a bit off his rocker in trying to locate his ex in the ensuing mayhem, but, other than that that, he's an Okay guy. He does find his gal but it's less than an ideal reunion. As a result, his plans for escape become more focused and realizable. The horror/ action is tight and makes sense in its own right. What happens to our hero is sad and, the final scene when he runs into his gal, is both surreal and sad. I don't believe anything like this has been done before.This is just a nifty little flick.

1423555,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B004PFOGJ2,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[3, 4]","Once Christmas has elapsed and good tidings are gone, it's only natural that our minds turn to horror cinema and, specifically, to the business of the zombie apocalypse (because you never know). As such, in the interest of self-preservation, it behooves us all to keep apprised of all zombie film releases. Case in point, RAMMBOCK BERLIN UNDEAD.I'm always hoping to pick up new survival tips from these walking dead pictures. Sadly, RAMMBOCK offers not much fresh illumination. It's a good thing there are other more helpful, info-friendly zombie films out there, else you can pretty much kiss humanity goodbye when the zombie apocalypse falls upon us. From purely a movie buff's perspective, I suppose that you can savor the pretty decent acting and the film's focus on characterization. As ever, a zombie flick's success depends on whether the viewer can latch onto the characters and emotionally invest in them. And I appreciate the lack of stupidity exhibited by the characters. Other than that chick yelling from her window, I didn't have much occasion to roll my eyes. But it's important to keep in mind that while zombies are indeed undead, it doesn't mean that they're deaf.The plot has an Austrian bloke named Michael traveling from Vienna to Berlin to drop in unannounced on his ex-girlfriend, Gabi, ostensibly to return her keys but, really, to see if he can rekindle that old flame. Except that he chooses to do this just as the zombie infestation was in the offing. In Gabi's cramped apartment, Michael evicts an infected plumber and horrifyingly learns that Gabi isn't home, having just stepped out for a mite, or so the young plumber's assistant, Harper, informs Michael. With zombies feverishly prowling and feasting outside, Michael and Harper find no recourse but to barricade themselves in Gabi's apartment. How it must've sucked when their sole bridge to the outside world - the television in which the networks had promised to keep viewers apprised of the epidemic - begins to show test patterns.RAMMBOCK BERLIN UNDEAD - in German with English sub-titles - is solid if unspectacular. It clocks in at a no-nonsense 61 minutes. The survivalist story takes place in the confines of an apartment block and, unfortunately for this tiny pocket of humanity, these zombies aren't the plodding, shambling kind. This contagion is more in keeping with the rage virus from 28 DAYS LATER, and so the deceased tend to flit around like Carl friggin' Lewis. The talking heads on the idiot box are pretty pointed about warning those who get infected to stay calm as losing one's cool would propel the virus to take effect even sooner.One nugget I did walk away with from this film: zombies may have aversion for bright lights. Survivalists all over should already be well stocked on batteries and halogen lamps. But maybe you should get an extra supply? You may not be as lucky as the cast of HAMMBOCK whose zombies demonstrate the courtesy of not being much in the film. There are occasional frenzied bursts of action as swarming infected maniacs compel the few survivors to fight their way out and scurry from room to room. But gorehounds will be disappointed by the lack of icky gore - or kill scenes, for that matter. Oh, and Michael does eventually find his ex-girlfriend Gabi. But, by then, he's lost the keys.The DVD's bonus stuff:- ""Zombiefication"" - tongue-in-cheek safety tips on how to survive exposure to zombies, except that this is just regurgitated material for old hands like us (00:07:04 minutes)- The Making of RAMMBOCK (in German, with English sub-titles; 00:15:52 minutes)",3,Undead in Deutschland,1324944000,"12 27, 2011",2011,3596,"['Once', 'Christmas', 'elapsed', 'good', 'tidings', 'are', 'gone', 'only', 'natural', 'minds', 'turn', 'horror', 'cinema', 'specifically', 'business', 'zombie', 'apocalypse', 'never', 'know', 'such', 'interest', 'self-preservation', 'keep', 'apprised', 'zombie', 'film', 'releases', 'Case', 'point', 'RAMMBOCK', 'BERLIN', 'UNDEAD.I', ""'m"", 'always', 'hoping', 'pick', 'up', 'new', 'survival', 'tips', 'walking', 'dead', 'pictures', 'Sadly', 'RAMMBOCK', 'not', 'much', 'fresh', 'illumination', 'good', 'thing', 'are', 'other', 'more', 'helpful', 'info-friendly', 'zombie', 'films', 'there', 'else', 'can', 'pretty', 'much', 'kiss', 'humanity', 'goodbye', 'when', 'zombie', 'apocalypse', 'From', 'purely', 'movie', 'buff', 'perspective', 'suppose', 'can', 'savor', 'pretty', 'decent', 'acting', 'film', 'focus', 'characterization', 'ever', 'zombie', 'flick', 'success', 'viewer', 'can', 'latch', 'characters', 'emotionally', 'invest', 'appreciate', 'lack', 'stupidity', 'exhibited', 'characters', 'Other', 'chick', 'yelling', 'window', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'occasion', 'roll', 'eyes', 'important', 'keep', 'mind', 'zombies', 'are', 'indeed', 'undead', ""n't"", 'mean', ""'re"", 'deaf.The', 'plot', 'Austrian', 'bloke', 'named', 'Michael', 'traveling', 'Vienna', 'Berlin', 'drop', 'unannounced', 'ex-girlfriend', 'Gabi', 'ostensibly', 'return', 'keys', 'really', 'see', 'can', 'rekindle', 'old', 'flame', 'do', 'just', 'zombie', 'infestation', 'was', 'offing', 'Gabi', 'cramped', 'apartment', 'Michael', 'infected', 'plumber', 'horrifyingly', 'Gabi', ""n't"", 'home', 'having', 'just', 'stepped', 'out', 'mite', 'so', 'young', 'plumber', 'assistant', 'Harper', 'Michael', 'zombies', 'feverishly', 'prowling', 'feasting', 'outside', 'Michael', 'Harper', 'find', 'recourse', 'barricade', 'Gabi', 'apartment', 'How', 'must', ""'ve"", 'sucked', 'when', 'sole', 'bridge', 'outside', 'world', 'television', 'networks', 'had', 'promised', 'keep', 'viewers', 'apprised', 'epidemic', 'show', 'test', 'patterns.RAMMBOCK', 'BERLIN', 'UNDEAD', 'German', 'English', 'sub-titles', 'solid', 'unspectacular', 'no-nonsense', '61', 'minutes', 'survivalist', 'story', 'place', 'confines', 'apartment', 'block', 'unfortunately', 'tiny', 'pocket', 'humanity', 'zombies', 'are', ""n't"", 'plodding', 'shambling', 'kind', 'contagion', 'more', 'keeping', 'rage', 'virus', '28', 'DAYS', 'LATER', 'so', 'deceased', 'tend', 'flit', 'Carl', 'friggin', 'Lewis', 'talking', 'heads', 'idiot', 'box', 'are', 'pretty', 'pointed', 'warning', 'who', 'get', 'infected', 'stay', 'calm', 'losing', 'one', 'cool', 'would', 'propel', 'virus', 'take', 'effect', 'even', 'sooner.One', 'nugget', 'did', 'walk', 'away', 'film', 'zombies', 'may', 'have', 'aversion', 'bright', 'lights', 'Survivalists', 'over', 'should', 'already', 'be', 'well', 'stocked', 'batteries', 'halogen', 'lamps', 'maybe', 'should', 'get', 'extra', 'supply', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'lucky', 'cast', 'HAMMBOCK', 'zombies', 'demonstrate', 'courtesy', 'not', 'being', 'much', 'film', 'are', 'occasional', 'frenzied', 'bursts', 'action', 'swarming', 'infected', 'maniacs', 'compel', 'few', 'survivors', 'fight', 'way', 'scurry', 'room', 'room', 'gorehounds', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'lack', 'icky', 'gore', 'kill', 'scenes', 'matter', 'Oh', 'Michael', 'eventually', 'find', 'ex-girlfriend', 'Gabi', 'then', 'lost', 'keys.The', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'stuff', 'Zombiefication', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'safety', 'tips', 'how', 'survive', 'exposure', 'zombies', 'just', 'regurgitated', 'material', 'old', 'hands', '00:07:04', 'minutes', 'Making', 'RAMMBOCK', 'German', 'English', 'sub-titles', '00:15:52', 'minutes']","Siege Of The Dead (a.k.a.

1423557,A1L7IMLGPF72GG,B004PFOGJ2,Howard M. Kindel,"[0, 1]","I've now watched a German, a French, an Irish, an Australian, a New Zealand, a Hong Kong, a Thailand and a Japanese zombie film.  This, of course, in addition to the prolific Italian and Spanish genres.  And each has had its own special aura.  ""Berlin Undead"" has a dark, brooding, almost introspective feel to it.  It's very slight on action, even on suspense; but the atmosphere is almost overpowering.  There's nothing surprising about seeing a group of zombies suddenly appear from out of nowhere because it just looks and feels like the kind of place where zombies might spontaneously generate.I didn't go to the ""Setup Menu"" because I just assumed it would be in German with English subtitles; but it wasn't, so my first viewing was in German only.  Even so, I could pretty easily follow along and enjoy the film.  I watched it a second time with English dialogue.  I had missed four crucial pieces. 1) The young man, Harper, was a plumber's helper - not the son of the main character, Michael's, girl friend Gabi, as I first thought.  2) The zombie plague was pathogenic in nature.  3) There apparently was a cure.  And 4), the use of sedatives could slow the pathogen's progress - this fourth piece of information made sense of the pills being passed around.The best part of the movie was the ending.  It wasn't the usual ambiguous ending but rather a clear escape by the survivors.  They were in a boat rowing down what appeared at first to be a little backwater stream till the scene opened up to show the boat being rowed in a great river (presumably either the Spree or the Havel).  They were headed for a ship whose foghorn had sounded sporadically throughout the film; it was assumed that the water provided the only safe haven.  This scene, of the rowboat all alone in the water, was even more brooding and introspective than the rest of the movie.All in all, this was probably the most unique zombie film I've ever seen. The zombies took a back seat not only to the main characters but to the environment itself.  And when the survivors planned and executed their escape, it wasn't so much to get away from the zombies as it was to seek food and a safe haven.",5,Score One More For The International Scene,1319760000,"10 28, 2011",2011,2175,"[""'ve"", 'now', 'watched', 'German', 'French', 'Irish', 'Australian', 'New', 'Zealand', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'Thailand', 'Japanese', 'zombie', 'film', 'course', 'addition', 'prolific', 'Italian', 'Spanish', 'genres', 'had', 'own', 'special', 'aura', 'Berlin', 'Undead', 'dark', 'brooding', 'almost', 'introspective', 'feel', 'very', 'slight', 'action', 'even', 'suspense', 'atmosphere', 'almost', 'overpowering', 'nothing', 'surprising', 'seeing', 'group', 'zombies', 'suddenly', 'appear', 'nowhere', 'just', 'feels', 'kind', 'place', 'where', 'zombies', 'might', 'spontaneously', 'generate.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'Setup', 'Menu', 'just', 'assumed', 'would', 'be', 'German', 'English', 'subtitles', 'was', ""n't"", 'first', 'viewing', 'was', 'German', 'only', 'Even', 'so', 'could', 'pretty', 'easily', 'follow', 'along', 'enjoy', 'film', 'watched', 'second', 'time', 'English', 'dialogue', 'had', 'missed', 'four', 'crucial', 'pieces', '1', 'young', 'man', 'Harper', 'was', 'plumber', 'helper', 'not', 'son', 'main', 'character', 'Michael', 'girl', 'friend', 'Gabi', 'first', 'thought', '2', 'zombie', 'plague', 'was', 'pathogenic', 'nature', '3', 'apparently', 'was', 'cure', '4', 'use', 'sedatives', 'could', 'slow', 'pathogen', 'progress', 'fourth', 'piece', 'information', 'made', 'sense', 'pills', 'being', 'passed', 'around.The', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'was', 'ending', 'was', ""n't"", 'usual', 'ambiguous', 'ending', 'rather', 'clear', 'escape', 'survivors', 'were', 'boat', 'rowing', 'down', 'what', 'appeared', 'first', 'be', 'little', 'backwater', 'stream', 'scene', 'opened', 'up', 'show', 'boat', 'being', 'rowed', 'great', 'river', 'presumably', 'either', 'Spree', 'Havel', 'were', 'headed', 'ship', 'foghorn', 'had', 'sounded', 'sporadically', 'film', 'was', 'assumed', 'water', 'provided', 'only', 'safe', 'haven', 'scene', 'rowboat', 'alone', 'water', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'brooding', 'introspective', 'rest', 'movie.All', 'was', 'probably', 'most', 'unique', 'zombie', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'zombies', 'took', 'back', 'seat', 'not', 'only', 'main', 'characters', 'environment', 'when', 'survivors', 'planned', 'executed', 'escape', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'get', 'away', 'zombies', 'was', 'seek', 'food', 'safe', 'haven']","Siege Of The Dead (a.k.a.

Praise God!Rammbock rocks, even if I have to watch it dubbed in English! But seriously, Rammbock is a really great ""zombie"" movie, and by far the best non-North American made zombie movie I have seen so far, and yes, I have seen The Horde (it`s saving grace is the fact that J. C. VanDam, Sylvester Stallone and Jason Statum are not in it)! The creators and writers of Rammbock did a fantastic job of coming up with a great story and then coming up with a well thought out and written script. The actors are super great, adding believability to the movie. Film production was also top notch; great filming, lighting and editing. And the zombies, well, they were good and zombie, no slacker fx / make-up jobs in this movie. I don't know what kind of budget the production had to work with, but they did a great job with every German cent they had. The movie had a real, raw grit feel to it, not like some over blown Resident Hollywood Evil over produced and under written high gloss crap that for some reason continues to make sequels.  Dubbing was not to bad, or I got use to it, accepted it and went with it and enjoyed the zombie goodness that Rammbock delivered. And for those of you looking for ""something new to the zombie genre"" well Rammbock's got that too.... You're not dealing with your same old reanimated dead undead zombies, nope, these guys are infected and all it takes is a bit of strong emotion to set them off into full attack zombie mode.

It's sort of like a Japanese movie, their mouthing doesn't fit the words perfectly, but it didn't annoy me.There are some pretty scary scenes in this movie. Does it live up to I Am Legend or The First Resident Evil? *Sorry if I am being biased, but those are my two favorite zombie movies* Certainly not. The production of this movie is not nearly the caliber of those two (obviously, haha) and it's a bit more of a funny zombie movie. Not Shaun of the Dead funny, but bad acting funny.The main character Michael (Michael Fuith) is looking for his ex-girlfriend Gabby. You do not know that they are exes in the beginning because of how in love, almost obsessively, he is with her. Maybe it was just the voice that was dubbed in English, but it started to annoy me how many times he said ""Gabby."" (Would make a GREAT drinking game!)The movie is short, very short at one hour, so it get's to the action right away... which isn't a bad thing. Of course the zombies (which are less than par special effect make up wise) do have a kryptonite, which is light... what I don't understand is that they do come out in sunlight, but they do not like bright flashes...The end is romantic, but just not enough in my opinion.

The premise of the movie is about apartment dwellers who try to survive the zombies in claustophobic conditions. The movie has surprising insights into human nature and humanity.

My rating of four stars presumes that you are a fan of the horror / zombie genre and not looking for Oscar-worthy cinema.  Be warned, the movie is in German.  The movie is sub-titled and I was able to ""read"" and follow the movie with no problem but I know many folks dislike (or hate) having to ""read"" a movie.This is not a long movie -- just over 60 minutes -- but does not feel like a ""short film"".  The movie follows Michael, who has come to Berlin in an effort to see (and re-connect) with his ex-girlfriend.  As he enters her block of apartments, he (and we) hear yelling and gunshots in the distance.  Michael finds the apartment, but his love is not there.  He is then confronted with the outbreak and ends up trapped in the apartment with a young plumber's assistant.  There is an interesting ""rear window"" dynamic between various characters trapped in their apartments but able to see and communicate with their neighbors (this block of apartments faces a central courtyard).  The characters are believable in their actions and quirks, which is not always the case for zombie movies and helps make this a superior zombie film.From a ""technical"" perspective, this is a viral outbreak movie where the infected become white eyed, mouth frothing homicidal maniacs (a la 28 Days Later or the American version of Rec).  The zombies are ""fast shamblers"" and our heroes discover they are sensitive to light (which becomes part of the obligatory PLAN the survivors come up with to escape).So put on your reading glasses, grab a German beer (but not so many as to slow your reading) and enjoy.",4,Nice addition to the zombie genre,1363219200,"03 14, 2013",2013,1646,"['liked', 'movie', 'being', 'fan', 'zombie', 'genre', 'rating', 'four', 'stars', 'are', 'fan', 'horror', '/', 'zombie', 'genre', 'not', 'looking', 'Oscar-worthy', 'cinema', 'Be', 'warned', 'movie', 'German', 'movie', 'sub-titled', 'was', 'able', 'read', 'follow', 'movie', 'problem', 'know', 'many', 'folks', 'dislike', 'hate', 'having', 'read', 'movie.This', 'not', 'long', 'movie', 'just', '60', 'minutes', 'not', 'feel', 'short', 'film', 'movie', 'Michael', 'who', 'come', 'Berlin', 'effort', 'see', 're-connect', 'ex-girlfriend', 'block', 'apartments', 'hear', 'yelling', 'gunshots', 'distance', 'Michael', 'apartment', 'love', 'not', 'there', 'then', 'confronted', 'outbreak', 'up', 'trapped', 'apartment', 'young', 'plumber', 'assistant', 'interesting', 'rear', 'window', 'dynamic', 'various', 'characters', 'trapped', 'apartments', 'able', 'see', 'communicate', 'neighbors', 'block', 'apartments', 'central', 'courtyard', 'characters', 'are', 'believable', 'actions', 'quirks', 'not', 'always', 'case', 'zombie', 'movies', 'helps', 'make', 'superior', 'zombie', 'technical', 'perspective', 'viral', 'outbreak', 'movie', 'where', 'infected', 'become', 'white', 'eyed', 'mouth', 'frothing', 'homicidal', 'maniacs', 'la', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'American', 'version', 'Rec', 'zombies', 'are', 'fast', 'shamblers', 'heroes', 'are', 'sensitive', 'light', 'part', 'obligatory', 'PLAN', 'survivors', 'come', 'up', 'escape', '.So', 'put', 'reading', 'glasses', 'grab', 'German', 'beer', 'not', 'so', 'many', 'slow', 'reading']","Siege Of The Dead (a.k.a.

If I hadn't seen that mentioned here, I'd never have noticed.It takes place in an apartment block in Germany and pretty well captured a realistic feel of being stuck with nowhere to go during a zombie outbreak.No real explanation for the outbreak is given and they're not ""technically"" zombies but I don't really get that picky. Apparently getting agitated after a bite transforms you and taking sedatives can hold back the change for a bit.Most of the story revolves around Michael who came to Berlin to bring some apartment keys to his ex-girlfriend Gabi who's out while a couple of plumbers are working. One of the Plumbers turns zombie and the other, a kid named Harper, along with Michael, lock themselves in the apartment. From there it's a matter of figuring out what to do next along with a few other apartment dwellers across the central courtyard. Michael is desperate to find Gabi and only seems to be thinking of her, while Harper seems a bit more ready to fight back.* Overall, I'd say this is worthy of a rental by diehard zombie fans.

This is to its credit; Kren and Hessler, both working on their first feature-length project, deliver a lean, mean flick heavy on the problem-solving skills and character interaction, but with still enough time for some stupid fun. What there isn't is a single wasted moment.Michael (&lt;em>Free to Leave&lt;/em>'s Michael Fuith) is a sad sack who has come back to Berlin (he lives in another city now) in order to return housekeys to his ex Gabi (Polish child actress Anna Graczyk in her first grown-up role), hoping to have one last chance to win her back. How pathetic is he? In the opening scene of the movie, he's trying out his delivery of the ""I brought your keys back"" routine on the guy he thumbed a ride from. Yeah, you know this will not end well. Just how badly it's going to turn out, though, Manni has no clue. Gabi's apartment doesn't have Gabi, but there's a plumber who's... chained to the radiator? Okay, why not? Michael thinks, and continues looking for Gabi, not realizing said plumber seems to be trying to eat him. (Think the immortal scene with Simon Pegg in the convenience store in &lt;em>Shaun of the Dead&lt;/em>.) The plumber's assistant, Harper (&lt;em>Die Weisse Band&lt;/em>'s Theo Trebs), is the first person to clue Michael in to the fact that something is amiss. The second clue comes when a horde of other flesh-hungry people try to find themselves a free Michael appetizer. (While the subtitle of the film in its American release is ""Berlin Undead"", I'm going with a Rage-like disease here instead, given the makeup, way of movement, etc.) At this point, with Michael and Harper trapped in Gabi's apartment, they notice a number of other survivors in other apartments, and the lot of them start sharing information by calling to one another across the courtyard. A bad idea if you've got a bunch of flesh-eaters running around, so the first part of the plan of attack: luring out the cannibals and closing off the courtyard...Given that you've got a cast of mostly unknowns and a writer and director who have previously only worked on a handful of shorts, this is quite a good little movie, mostly straightforward action/horror/comedy, but with a few touches of the surreal thrown in for good measure (WHAT IN THE NAME OF GOD WAS WITH THE FURSUIT???).

The movie is about their survival and what one will do to survive.Michael is torn between the microcosm of finding his gf and saving her forks from harm and the macrocosm of the enormity of the situation. It examines the spectrum of human emotions and what we would do when faced with a full blown viral zombie infection.This movie also needlessly deals with ""where do we go to the bathroom"" issue.

Running just over an hour, the story is set primarily in an apartment building in Berlin, which has suddenly been overrun by the infected.  The movie doesn't have a large budget, but with German as the spoken language, still features some good acting performances, and decent action scenes.  Although the outbreak genre is quite saturated, Rammbock still manages to incorporate a few new wrinkles.Michael (Michael Fuith) arrives at his girlfriend Gabi's apartment, hoping to patch up their relationship.  She isn't home, and Michael suddenly finds himself being attacked by a plumber who was working in the unit.  Along with Harper (Theo Trebs), the plumber's helper, Michael manages to evict the infected man, and lock themselves inside the apartment.  Safe for the moment, the pair peer out a window overlooking a courtyard, and see other survivors in the units on the other side.  They all watch as a group of the infected swam into the building, and attack anyone they encounter.The survivors learn from TV new reports that there has been an outbreak, and that sedatives may be effective in slowing the effects.  One of the survivors on the other side, tells Michael that there is a supply of sedatives in the unit next to Gabi's, and offers food in return for the drugs.  In a creative move, Harper and Michael build a battering ram, and break through the wall into the adjoining apartment, but they are soon on the run from the infected.  Harper discovers that the infected have a weakness, and manages to drive the hoard from the building, and lock them outside.  The small group of survivors comes up with a bold plan, but selfishness produces tragic results, and forces them to improvise.Shot mostly in dimly lighted locations, the film has a dull, gritty look, and dark depressing atmosphere, as the infected appear to be mostly former working class types.  The makeup effects and gore are adequate, and not overdone.  For non-speakers of German, evaluating the acting via subtitles involves some speculation, but the performances seem to be fairly well grounded in reality.Aware of its limitations, Rammbock doesn't attempt to do too much, taking a rather simplistic approach, that is mostly effective.  Cut to the bone, the film isn't padded with unnecessary scenes, or overdramatic banter.  While not perfect, it's a tight little adventure that provides some solid scares, and down to earth performances.",3,the infected invade berlin...,1349136000,"10 2, 2012",2012,2551,"['fairly', 'familiar', 'storyline', 'Rammbock', 'Berlin', 'Undead', '2010', 'viral', 'outbreak', 'film', 'homicidal', 'flesheaters', 'Running', 'just', 'hour', 'story', 'set', 'primarily', 'apartment', 'building', 'Berlin', 'suddenly', 'been', 'overrun', 'infected', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'large', 'budget', 'German', 'spoken', 'language', 'still', 'good', 'acting', 'performances', 'decent', 'action', 'scenes', 'outbreak', 'genre', 'quite', 'saturated', 'Rammbock', 'still', 'incorporate', 'few', 'new', 'wrinkles.Michael', 'Michael', 'Fuith', 'girlfriend', 'Gabi', 'apartment', 'hoping', 'patch', 'up', 'relationship', ""n't"", 'home', 'Michael', 'suddenly', 'being', 'attacked', 'plumber', 'who', 'was', 'working', 'unit', 'Harper', 'Theo', 'Trebs', 'plumber', 'helper', 'Michael', 'evict', 'infected', 'man', 'lock', 'apartment', 'Safe', 'moment', 'pair', 'out', 'window', 'overlooking', 'courtyard', 'see', 'other', 'survivors', 'units', 'other', 'side', 'watch', 'group', 'infected', 'swam', 'building', 'attack', 'anyone', 'encounter.The', 'survivors', 'learn', 'TV', 'new', 'reports', 'been', 'outbreak', 'sedatives', 'may', 'be', 'effective', 'slowing', 'effects', 'One', 'survivors', 'other', 'side', 'Michael', 'supply', 'sedatives', 'unit', 'next', 'Gabi', 'food', 'return', 'drugs', 'creative', 'move', 'Harper', 'Michael', 'build', 'battering', 'ram', 'break', 'wall', 'adjoining', 'apartment', 'are', 'soon', 'run', 'infected', 'Harper', 'infected', 'have', 'weakness', 'drive', 'hoard', 'building', 'lock', 'outside', 'small', 'group', 'survivors', 'up', 'bold', 'plan', 'selfishness', 'produces', 'tragic', 'results', 'improvise.Shot', 'mostly', 'dimly', 'lighted', 'locations', 'film', 'dull', 'gritty', 'look', 'dark', 'depressing', 'atmosphere', 'infected', 'appear', 'be', 'mostly', 'former', 'working', 'class', 'types', 'makeup', 'effects', 'gore', 'are', 'adequate', 'not', 'overdone', 'non-speakers', 'German', 'evaluating', 'acting', 'subtitles', 'speculation', 'performances', 'seem', 'be', 'fairly', 'well', 'grounded', 'reality.Aware', 'limitations', 'Rammbock', ""n't"", 'attempt', 'do', 'too', 'much', 'taking', 'rather', 'simplistic', 'approach', 'mostly', 'effective', 'Cut', 'bone', 'film', ""n't"", 'padded', 'unnecessary', 'scenes', 'overdramatic', 'banter', 'not', 'perfect', 'tight', 'little', 'adventure', 'solid', 'scares', 'down', 'earth', 'performances']","Siege Of The Dead (a.k.a.

Never once did the movie state that the infected were ""undead"" which was disappointing given the title of the movie. There was a palatable lack of gore and the zombie smashing/bashing I've become accustomed to in recent genre films. This movie lacked intensity, which was building during each scene and then lost at the moment of truth each time.
