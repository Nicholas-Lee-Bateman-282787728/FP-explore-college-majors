I have been waiting for years, wishing somebody would please release the Dinosaurs seasons on DVD.  Finally, they have released season one and two May 2nd. I bought it yesterday and I have to say that it has brought back a lot of nostalgia. When I was younger, I was like everyone else and watched it for the dinosaurs, same as now. But it also has things for the older audience as well with jokes adults understand. Although it is by Disney and it is a Disney release, it's not really a kid's show. Sure, it's like I said and it has dinosaurs, but they also drink beer and cuss.Watching this series as an adult is just as fun as it was when I was younger. The animatronics are excellent. You will find yourself in awe just staring at how well done the character's facial expressions are. The acting is great as well, the voice actors do an excellent job at making the characters come to life and be believable.  It's like watching a dinosaur version of the Honeymooners. The jokes are fresh and still very funny. From just the first episode, I found myself laughing at a lot of the jokes.Speaking as a fan of the series when it originally aired who grew up and bought this DVD, I can say that it is still as fun as it was when I watched it originally. If you loved Dinosaurs years ago, get this DVD!! You will have as much fun as you did when you first watched this great series. Season One and Two is a must have, that is 29 episodes and it also has two ""making of"" special features and Easter eggs!!! What a great package.

Nevertheless, there is always one that has definitely delivered well. With the success of the Henson family, and Jim Henson Productions, the Muppets had a hugely successful franchise base that still has delivered today, but innovations of the prehistoric past have also brought in very well too. With Dinosaurs, the show became a outrageous and cult classic about Earl Sinclair and his family Robbie, Charlene, Baby, and his wife Fran through the comical prehistoric times. Now, it finally has a home on home video.Dinosaurs: The Complete First & Second Seasons really became the prime of the ABC series. The DVD compilation includes some of the funniest primetime episodes ever, that still introduce comical and delightful family fun. The episodes that are highlighted here definitely still remain as pure delights like Family Challenge, where Earl & company go on this television game show just to have a chance to play for a television set, and Nuts To War Parts I & II where the dinosaur population goes to war over pistachio nuts and Robbie gets himself into the conflict, and Golden Horn, where Baby Sinclair is declared The Golden Child from a horn coming out on his head, and becomes a popular favorite among the populace that also is the most powerful leader in the realm of Pangia. The episodes here were definitely remastered well, and still deliver within each moment of delight and fun.For those who haven't seen Dinosaurs during its era on ABC, this is a absolute delight for all to watch and enjoy. I loved this show when it was on television years ago, and everytime I get the chance to see these classic shows, they still are just as funny and exciting as they were years ago. I absolutely recommend Dinosaurs: The Complete First & Second Seasons.

Absolutely, all the time--when I'm cleaning up the house and need a few laughs in the background, when I'm tired of reality television/depressing news stories and would rather watch a cute baby and his grumpy siblings take on the problems of global warming and establishing gender identity in ways both earnest and ridiculous, and when I'm trying to entertain my three-year-old, who simply loves the idea of ""thunder lizards"" walking the Earth. This is a show that is good for all ages (from 2 to 200 )and is full of humorous allusions to popular culture, as well as good lessons about taking care of the environment, taking a friend's advice with a pinch of salt, standing up for individuality, and celebrating eccentricities.
