761788,ACXHNOC6L8LUO,B0000A5A1K,Artist & Author,"[2, 2]","Although this movie is generally for kids, my five-year-old grandson was a bit frightened by some of this movie.  He was fine when I had him sit on my lap, and told him the boy in the movie was brave just like he was.  His seven-year-old sister was fine with it.  That said, this is a movie the family can enjoy together.  I am not sure any lessons are very clear; maybe that life is more than being a hermit that doesn't like kids.  Of course the little boy in the movie won over the heart of the cold-hearted, bitter magician.  So the magician got his wife back and took in the orphaned boy, typical of all movies like this one.  It isn't a great movie, but fun to watch with the kids.",3,"Entertaining, But Not a Classic",1203120000,"02 16, 2008",2008,687,"['movie', 'generally', 'kids', 'five-year-old', 'grandson', 'was', 'bit', 'frightened', 'movie', 'was', 'fine', 'when', 'had', 'sit', 'lap', 'told', 'boy', 'movie', 'was', 'brave', 'just', 'was', 'seven-year-old', 'sister', 'was', 'fine', 'said', 'movie', 'family', 'can', 'enjoy', 'together', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'lessons', 'are', 'very', 'clear', 'maybe', 'life', 'more', 'being', 'hermit', ""n't"", 'like', 'kids', 'course', 'little', 'boy', 'movie', 'won', 'heart', 'cold-hearted', 'bitter', 'magician', 'magician', 'got', 'wife', 'back', 'took', 'orphaned', 'boy', 'typical', 'movies', 'one', ""n't"", 'great', 'movie', 'fun', 'watch', 'kids']",Spooky House

Its low buget (like GooseBumps) but I'd say more closely resembling SandLot or Never Ending Story (of which I only liked the first one). I found myself wanting to stop but couldn't, I just had to see what happened next, but then having a professional magician as a father most likely helped too.I deffiantly recommend this for anyone looking for 'nicer' story of a different type, not high budget, not real flashy, not an 'on the edge of your seat' type of movie but just a good alround family show, with a few funny parts here and there.But if your looking for 'Spooky', 'Scary', 'High Budget', something you would pay at a theator to see, then keep looking (but be sure to bookmark it for a later date!)",5,Spooky House,1152057600,"07 5, 2006",2006,971,"['found', 'one', 'searching', 'GooseBumps', 'shows', 'daughters', 'loved', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'how', 'got', 'wrapped', 'up', 'show', 'not', ""'glitzy"", 'GooseBumps', 'definatly', 'not', 'spooky', 'show', 'GooseBumps', 'rather', 'pleasant', 'alternative', 'low', 'buget', 'GooseBumps', ""'d"", 'say', 'more', 'closely', 'resembling', 'SandLot', 'Never', 'Ending', 'Story', 'only', 'liked', 'first', 'one', 'found', 'wanting', 'stop', 'could', ""n't"", 'just', 'had', 'see', 'what', 'happened', 'next', 'then', 'having', 'professional', 'magician', 'father', 'most', 'likely', 'helped', 'too.I', 'deffiantly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'looking', ""'nicer"", 'story', 'different', 'type', 'not', 'high', 'budget', 'not', 'real', 'flashy', 'not', 'edge', 'seat', 'type', 'movie', 'just', 'good', 'alround', 'family', 'show', 'few', 'funny', 'parts', 'here', 'there.But', 'looking', ""'Spooky"", ""'Scary"", ""'High"", 'Budget', 'something', 'would', 'pay', 'theator', 'see', 'then', 'keep', 'looking', 'be', 'sure', 'bookmark', 'later', 'date']",Spooky House

Gunderson ""gundy""","[1, 2]","First off, I am not one to post negative reviews but in this case, I felt the need in hopes of preventing others from making the same mistake I did in buying and watching this mainly based on the many positive reviews posted here (which I really don't understand). This is flat out one of the worst movies I have ever seen and I have watched (and collected) hundreds over the years of all genres. The storyline is haphazzard jumping all over the place for the first half of the movie not even making sense at times, the script/dialogue is awful, the character portrayals (I won't even call it acting) is horrendous, the cinematography and editing is terrible, the ""special effects"" are a joke and even the few bits of music sprinkled in would rather have you sticking needles in your ears. I understand this was made for children and not meant to be Oscar-worthy material but you still have to draw the line somewhere. Additionally, there are aspects of the film that some parents may not want to subject their children to. Bullying is one of the central themes and is rampant throughout along with the violence that comes with it; the evil ""coughing lady"" when shown, is almost always smoking not one but multiple cigarettes at once (hence her nickname); guns are used threateningly during a standoff in the final scene (though one turns out to be fake) and there are several scenes that may be frightening for younger viewers (it is about a ""spooky house"" after all) but I would expect that due to the afforementioned lack of quality filmmaking, will have most adults laughing. Though the intentions for this film may have been honorable, the execution is terrible. I watched this with my 9-year old daughter who enjoyed being able to predict what would happen next which made her happy. Of course this is just my personal opinion but I like to think I have a pretty open mind, and don't say you haven't been warned.",1,Unbelievably AWFUL!,1356912000,"12 31, 2012",2012,1918,"['First', 'am', 'not', 'one', 'post', 'negative', 'reviews', 'case', 'felt', 'need', 'hopes', 'preventing', 'others', 'making', 'same', 'mistake', 'did', 'buying', 'watching', 'mainly', 'based', 'many', 'positive', 'reviews', 'posted', 'here', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'flat', 'one', 'worst', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'have', 'watched', 'collected', 'hundreds', 'years', 'genres', 'storyline', 'haphazzard', 'jumping', 'place', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'not', 'even', 'making', 'sense', 'times', 'script/dialogue', 'awful', 'character', 'portrayals', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'call', 'acting', 'horrendous', 'cinematography', 'editing', 'terrible', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'joke', 'even', 'few', 'bits', 'music', 'sprinkled', 'would', 'rather', 'have', 'sticking', 'needles', 'ears', 'understand', 'was', 'made', 'children', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'Oscar-worthy', 'material', 'still', 'have', 'draw', 'line', 'somewhere', 'Additionally', 'are', 'aspects', 'film', 'parents', 'may', 'not', 'want', 'subject', 'children', 'Bullying', 'one', 'central', 'themes', 'rampant', 'violence', 'evil', 'coughing', 'lady', 'when', 'shown', 'almost', 'always', 'smoking', 'not', 'one', 'multiple', 'cigarettes', 'once', 'hence', 'nickname', 'guns', 'are', 'used', 'threateningly', 'standoff', 'final', 'scene', 'one', 'out', 'be', 'fake', 'are', 'several', 'scenes', 'may', 'be', 'frightening', 'younger', 'viewers', 'spooky', 'house', 'would', 'expect', 'due', 'afforementioned', 'lack', 'quality', 'filmmaking', 'will', 'have', 'most', 'adults', 'laughing', 'intentions', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'honorable', 'execution', 'terrible', 'watched', '9-year', 'old', 'daughter', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'being', 'able', 'predict', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'next', 'made', 'happy', 'course', 'just', 'personal', 'opinion', 'like', 'think', 'have', 'pretty', 'open', 'mind', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'warned']",Spooky House
