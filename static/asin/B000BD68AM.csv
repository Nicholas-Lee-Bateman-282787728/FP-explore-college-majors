It is so very educational and helpful for toddlers that will begin pre-kindergarten or kindergarten. The video makes learning the alphabet fun and the child will like it so much that they interact with the letters. I am a big fan of these videos and DEFINITELY RECOMMEND them to parents!! You will not regret it!!!,5,Another Successful Video,1392336000,"02 14, 2014",2014,394,"['have', 'rented', 'videos', 'Kathy', 'Oxley', '3', 'year', 'old', 'so', 'very', 'educational', 'helpful', 'toddlers', 'will', 'begin', 'pre-kindergarten', 'kindergarten', 'video', 'learning', 'alphabet', 'fun', 'child', 'will', 'like', 'so', 'much', 'interact', 'letters', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'videos', 'DEFINITELY', 'RECOMMEND', 'parents', 'will', 'not', 'regret']",Meet the Letters

940631,AAFVB4SGR3AC5,B000BD68AM,"C. Sharifi ""CS""","[1, 1]","Meet the LettersMy youngest son has special needs & mainly uses sign language as a form of communication.  My son can learn all sorts of things from these videos that he was unable to learn in preshcool.  With just days of ""Meet the Numbers"" he knew several numbers and with 2 weeks of ""Meet the Letters"" he was able to name many letters on the cover of Meet the Numbers.  This is a big deal because just saying words clear enough for us to understand is hard yet he was able to say these things.  I even consider somewhat of a speech therapy while he does the video because he talks along with them.  With the simple & repetitive style it is very easy to pick up and they associate the characters with what they are leraning and are able to generatlize it into every day activities.  I HIGHLY recomend this item not only for normal children but for those with special needs.  We use our's in the car on the way to school.

940632,AW7VVW61YKZIQ,B000BD68AM,"J M P ""Hotel Mom 123""","[0, 0]","The first five minutes of this video and I was personally wondering how I was going to sit through it with my two year old and convinced that he would be up and requesting to watch something else in about the same time. Much to my surprise he watched the entire thing (the main segment) and asked to watch more (and watched about half of it) after dinner. The main video is pretty bare bones repetition, plus there is an alphabet song. Very quickly my son could figure out alot of the character representations such as D is for dancing. My only hang up with this video is that some of the characters I don't understand. My husband figured out E was for earrings on the second go, still don't understand why G is sitting in a swimming pool. This might make me dumb, but if I can't figure it out I am not sure how a toddler can. I cannot really tell you what the real outcome for results is of yet as my son already actively recognizes most of the capital letters and I haven't really quizzed him, but it seems to draw in the interest and looks like it should be a good tool. One interesting thing is that the whole video is also available in Spanish. Thus, when he gets a little older and masters his first language he could view this to watch the Spanish alphabet. No miracles here, just good old fashion learning--but definitely don't feel like this was a bad idea.",4,Got request for a second viewing,1287273600,"10 17, 2010",2010,1366,"['first', 'five', 'minutes', 'video', 'was', 'personally', 'wondering', 'how', 'was', 'going', 'sit', 'two', 'year', 'old', 'convinced', 'would', 'be', 'up', 'requesting', 'watch', 'something', 'else', 'same', 'time', 'Much', 'surprise', 'watched', 'entire', 'thing', 'main', 'segment', 'asked', 'watch', 'more', 'watched', 'half', 'dinner', 'main', 'video', 'pretty', 'bare', 'bones', 'repetition', 'alphabet', 'song', 'Very', 'quickly', 'son', 'could', 'figure', 'out', 'alot', 'character', 'representations', 'such', 'D', 'dancing', 'only', 'up', 'video', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'husband', 'figured', 'out', 'E', 'was', 'earrings', 'second', 'go', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'G', 'sitting', 'swimming', 'pool', 'might', 'make', 'dumb', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'toddler', 'can', 'can', 'not', 'really', 'tell', 'what', 'real', 'outcome', 'results', 'yet', 'son', 'already', 'actively', 'most', 'capital', 'letters', 'have', ""n't"", 'really', 'quizzed', 'draw', 'interest', 'should', 'be', 'good', 'tool', 'One', 'interesting', 'thing', 'whole', 'video', 'also', 'available', 'Spanish', 'Thus', 'when', 'little', 'older', 'masters', 'first', 'language', 'could', 'view', 'watch', 'Spanish', 'alphabet', 'miracles', 'here', 'just', 'good', 'old', 'fashion', 'learning', 'definitely', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', 'bad', 'idea']",Meet the Letters
