I see most of them had the same problem, but one reviewer led off with cane toads and golf clubs and pretty much nailed it.You can see all the awards, every one well-deserved.  It was faithful to the tone of the novel, which my wife has read and which I'll find.  And then you can read all these reviews and still wonder what this movie is about.  That's the beauty of it.

875965,A3G0TESLQF4HFK,B0006ZUJ8M,Bryan A. Pfleeger,"[1, 1]","Director Richard Lowenstein attempts to film the unfilmable John Birmingham novel of shared living arrangements in He Died with a Falafel in His Hand. The film loosely follows the travails of a writer named Danny (Noah Taylor) as he moves in an out of three shared houses in Australia. The houses and the roomies as much as the cities of Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney get top billing here.The film winds its quirky way from location to location introducing us to new characters and those who follow Danny around. Lowenstein fills his movie with a ton of pop culture references which the careful viewer will have no problem spotting. There is a good deal of homage to the French New Wave as there is to classic comedy. The film is an entertaining and humorous look at the social environment and its impact on the individual. Lowenstein's script acutely captures the angst, the disparity, the conflict and the heart of the characters, each of which is beautifully drawn. The ensemble cast is especially good and this is a film that gets better with repeated viewings. It may put off some with its lack of cohesive plotline but is rewarding to those who stick with it. The film , like much of Lowenstein's work is likely to develop a cult following sa more and more people see it.",3,Quirky and Fun,1311120000,"07 20, 2011",2011,1278,"['Director', 'Richard', 'Lowenstein', 'film', 'unfilmable', 'John', 'Birmingham', 'novel', 'shared', 'living', 'arrangements', 'Died', 'Falafel', 'Hand', 'film', 'loosely', 'travails', 'writer', 'named', 'Danny', 'Noah', 'Taylor', 'out', 'three', 'shared', 'houses', 'Australia', 'houses', 'roomies', 'as', 'much', 'cities', 'Brisbane', 'Melbourne', 'Sydney', 'get', 'top', 'billing', 'here.The', 'film', 'quirky', 'way', 'location', 'location', 'introducing', 'new', 'characters', 'who', 'follow', 'Danny', 'Lowenstein', 'movie', 'ton', 'pop', 'culture', 'references', 'careful', 'viewer', 'will', 'have', 'problem', 'spotting', 'good', 'deal', 'homage', 'French', 'New', 'Wave', 'classic', 'comedy', 'film', 'entertaining', 'humorous', 'look', 'social', 'environment', 'impact', 'individual', 'Lowenstein', 'script', 'acutely', 'angst', 'disparity', 'conflict', 'heart', 'characters', 'beautifully', 'drawn', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'especially', 'good', 'film', 'better', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'may', 'put', 'off', 'lack', 'cohesive', 'plotline', 'rewarding', 'who', 'stick', 'film', 'much', 'Lowenstein', 'work', 'likely', 'develop', 'cult', 'following', 'sa', 'more', 'more', 'people', 'see']",He Died with a Felafel in His Hand

Granted, cultural and literary references were plentiful and cleverly integrated, but I too often found the dialogue tedious.2. Many of the plot situations were over the top and just not that funny to me---a tribal roasting interrupted by skin heads???  I felt these silly plot gags were at odds with the often deadpan pseudo(?) intellectual dialogue.  The tone of the movie veered from one extreme to the other.3. There really was not much of a plot, which is ok with me if there is sufficient character development.  But I didn't find much character development here either.

We sit and stare at it for a bit, then a three wood lines up alongside it. It disappears, then you hear a cry of ""Fore!"" cut to main title, and there's a wet thwack. If you almost fall off your chair laughing at this scene, then I can guarantee you that He Died with a Felafel in His Hand is a movie that you're going to enjoy in a big way.The movie follows Danny (Max's Noah Taylor), a chronically unemployed Australian who fancies himself a writer, as he tries to find cheap living arrangements that don't feature neurotic and/or insane flatmates. A number of those we meet in his first living arrangement (""House #43"") keep popping up as he goes from place to place, including his childhood pal Sam (Emily Hamilton, probably best remembered on this side of the pond for Haunted, her first big-screen role) and his best friend Flip (Brett Stewart). Other than that, I can't say much of anything about the movie without unveiling a number of spoilers; like most slice-of-life films, every event builds on what comes before it.It's funny, but laced with a number of moments of surprisingly poignant human drama that will keep the chick-flick fans happy. Some of the acting is a bit subpar, and some of the minor characters aren't fully fleshed out, but these are nitpicky complaints in a movie this good. ****",4,Now THAT'S comedy!,1178841600,"05 11, 2007",2007,1438,"['Died', 'Felafel', 'Hand', 'Richard', 'Lowenstein', '2001', 'movie', 'opening', 'scene', 'close-up', 'Australian', 'cane', 'toad', 'sit', 'stare', 'bit', 'then', 'three', 'wood', 'lines', 'up', 'then', 'hear', 'cry', 'Fore', 'cut', 'main', 'title', 'wet', 'thwack', 'almost', 'fall', 'off', 'chair', 'laughing', 'scene', 'then', 'can', 'guarantee', 'Died', 'Felafel', 'Hand', 'movie', ""'re"", 'going', 'enjoy', 'big', 'way.The', 'movie', 'Danny', 'Max', 'Noah', 'Taylor', 'chronically', 'unemployed', 'Australian', 'who', 'writer', 'find', 'cheap', 'living', 'arrangements', 'do', ""n't"", 'feature', 'neurotic', 'and/or', 'insane', 'flatmates', 'number', 'meet', 'first', 'living', 'arrangement', 'House', '43', 'keep', 'popping', 'up', 'place', 'place', 'including', 'childhood', 'pal', 'Sam', 'Emily', 'Hamilton', 'probably', 'best', 'remembered', 'side', 'pond', 'Haunted', 'first', 'big-screen', 'role', 'best', 'friend', 'Flip', 'Brett', 'Stewart', 'Other', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'anything', 'movie', 'unveiling', 'number', 'spoilers', 'most', 'slice-of-life', 'films', 'event', 'what', 'it.It', 'funny', 'laced', 'number', 'moments', 'surprisingly', 'poignant', 'human', 'drama', 'will', 'keep', 'chick-flick', 'fans', 'happy', 'acting', 'bit', 'subpar', 'minor', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'fully', 'fleshed', 'out', 'are', 'nitpicky', 'complaints', 'movie', 'good', '****']",He Died with a Felafel in His Hand
