Some fictionalize events and for the most part true.

Schneider,"[20, 20]","Endings always come at last, endings always come too fast...The people who made this brilliant TV series had the wisdom to conclude it after three and a half seasons. It doesn't pay to overstretch a tale.The story, that Trem&eacute; tells us, is about post-Katrina New Orleans, up to the time of Obama's inauguration. It is about politics, police corruption, real estate speculation, high and low crime, the legal system, the culture... Culture mainly about music, mardi gras, and the music and restaurant businesses.We follow a dozen people through their lives, as in any other soap. We follow a traditional trombonist, a lawyer with a social agenda, a bar owner with awful bad luck, but fighting spirit, a chef with similar characteristics, a DJ, an honest cop, a violinist, a modern jazz trumpeter, a carnival fanatic, an ambiguous, deceptively charming speculator shark.... And whom have I forgotten?In a way, this plot is all just a smoke screen, a pretext to give us plenty of music. We are rarely left without music for more than a few minutes. We get studio sessions, practice sessions at home, funerals, orchestra class at school, the DJ at work, mardi gras processions, live gigs in bars and concert halls... The music includes all shades of jazz, blues, rock, country...

1673251,AI1HCK9KJ5QX7,B00FRKKVL6,JB,"[0, 0]","The five-episode fifth season is really better described as a miniseries. And yet, watching the episodes conveyed to me a sense that a full season had been stuffed in there. Any concerns about the show seemingly losing steam as season 3 progressed will quickly be allayed as the first episode rockets into the election of Barack Obama, the ascendance of Trombone Shorty, and a significant time jump for all the characters you've come to know and love.The episodes are packed to the brim with music, to the point where some of the more peripheral characters are largely pushed out (Sonny, if I'm not mistaken, skips a couple of episodes entirely). However, everyone gets a resolution. Not a neat, tied up one that suggests their lives will be perfect from here on out, but something that satisfies the various plot threads that have been developing since season 3 (and really since the beginning). References to earlier episodes abound.A special mention to the drama of cancer being played out. Having gone through similar scenarios myself more than once, the struggle of a family to deal with the issue was played out in a way that felt emotionally honest and extremely heart-rending.The show ends demurely; honestly I can't even remember what the final shot is, but it doesn't matter. The last episode as a whole was an appropriate goodbye to a show that provided engaging and powerful storytelling for four years, again directed by Agnieszka Holland who directed the pilot, and again with some jaw-dropping imagery.The packaging is a conventional DVD case (unlike the other seasons with their nice cardboard slipcases), but that's hardly a reason not to buy it. If you haven't finished the show, finish it, and if you haven't started it, start. It's a credit to HBO that they supported even this many episodes of a show that had very low viewership and (somehow) won them little to nothing in terms of awards and prestige, yet which consistently produced high art and covered important issues.

The characters are complex, the filming rich with nuance, the music--jazz, blues--beyond compare. Other films have tried to pare music with drama, but most fail. The music seems an odd add-on; the characters a mere appendage. But Treme understands that without music there is no New Orleans. Those of us who lament the paucity of good drama on television should fear no more; those of us who lament the vacuity in many of the present movies in our cinemas still have much to regret.

"" ' You Know What It Means To Miss New Orleans'Lights down, the last season of 'Treme', shown in five episodes. David Simon, the co-creator and writer, played it beautifully. The last season was one of the best, however, you had to have the first three, to fully understand what happened during and after Katrina. We grew to love the city, the culture, the music, we learned a lot about New Orleans music and it's part in Treme. The musicians who inhabit,who come and go. The characters in 'Treme', who had their ups and downs and downs again in every year. The scumbags, the hoodlums, the police, the Mayor, Ray Nagy. We followed the news and the crimes, the bodies, the deaths, the careless nature in which people were treated, particularly the African Americans.This last season gives us a summary of the lives of all the characters. We learn more about their true natures, where they may be headed. I particularly loved the last episode. It ended as it started, but the lives of those involved had all been changed, drastically.'Treme'' ended with Hope in it's veins. We know that New Orleans has not changed that much, the vultures, the money grubbers are still around, but we can sense some changes wrought by the hard work of the people who love New Orleans.
