It was an obsession of mine. I recall being engrossed by the animation, the music, the battles, and the overall drama of it all. It's been over ten years since I lost that tape and my memories of it became increasingly blurred. But the awe I felt whenever the movie was switched on never left me. A part of me felt just slightly empty in the duration of these numerous years, and I always gained a slight satisfaction whenever I tried to conjure up the memories of this enigmatic Transformers film.Well, after all these years of emptiness, I suddenly had an epiphany: ""Why not search the Internet for that cool Transformers movie I saw over 13 years ago?"" One click lead to another and the tape soon thereafter in my possession. Let me tell you this: Transformers: The Movie is a great movie. The rock score, the heroism, the drama, the anime-style action and battle sequences... it's all there and it's even better than I remembered. Oh, there's definitely a seminal quality to it, as the animation ranges from plain ugly to beautifully fluid. It's also a little hard to appreciate if you're not a Transformers fan. But the more you watch it, the more you realize the true beauty behind what first ""meets the eye."" This animated flick was ahead of its time when it saw its release in 1986. Transformers: The Movie dared to aim at a more mature film back when Disney was still doing movies with dragons and castles.  It's kind of like what Don Bluth did with Titan A.E. in trying to revolutionize public perception of the animated film with more mature themes, except Transformers: TM came out much earlier. First-class tale of heroism and destiny with a ""so cheesy that it's cool"" rock-score, and a dramatic, well-organized plot make this one of the most underrated movie in recent memory.  A classic that deserves a look by those who didn't see it when it came out.",5,Greatest film ever shunned by the public?,952387200,"03 7, 2000",2000,1993,"['When', 'was', 'little', 'kid', 'used', 'be', 'entranced', 'clips', 'Transformers', 'flicks', 'messily', 'recorded', 'low', 'quality', 'beta', 'tape', 'was', 'obsession', 'mine', 'recall', 'being', 'engrossed', 'animation', 'music', 'battles', 'overall', 'drama', 'been', 'ten', 'years', 'lost', 'tape', 'memories', 'became', 'increasingly', 'blurred', 'awe', 'felt', 'whenever', 'movie', 'was', 'switched', 'never', 'left', 'part', 'felt', 'just', 'slightly', 'empty', 'duration', 'numerous', 'years', 'always', 'gained', 'slight', 'satisfaction', 'whenever', 'tried', 'conjure', 'up', 'memories', 'enigmatic', 'Transformers', 'film.Well', 'years', 'emptiness', 'suddenly', 'had', 'epiphany', 'Why', 'not', 'search', 'Internet', 'cool', 'Transformers', 'movie', 'saw', '13', 'years', 'ago', 'One', 'click', 'lead', 'tape', 'soon', 'thereafter', 'possession', 'Let', 'tell', 'Transformers', 'Movie', 'great', 'movie', 'rock', 'score', 'heroism', 'drama', 'anime-style', 'action', 'battle', 'sequences', 'there', 'even', 'better', 'remembered', 'Oh', 'definitely', 'seminal', 'quality', 'animation', 'plain', 'ugly', 'beautifully', 'fluid', 'also', 'little', 'hard', 'appreciate', ""'re"", 'not', 'Transformers', 'fan', 'more', 'watch', 'more', 'realize', 'true', 'beauty', 'what', 'first', 'eye', 'animated', 'flick', 'was', 'ahead', 'time', 'when', 'saw', 'release', '1986', 'Transformers', 'Movie', 'dared', 'aim', 'more', 'mature', 'film', 'back', 'when', 'Disney', 'was', 'still', 'doing', 'movies', 'dragons', 'castles', 'kind', 'what', 'Don', 'Bluth', 'did', 'Titan', 'A.E', 'trying', 'revolutionize', 'public', 'perception', 'animated', 'film', 'more', 'mature', 'themes', 'Transformers', 'TM', 'came', 'out', 'much', 'earlier', 'First-class', 'tale', 'heroism', 'destiny', 'so', 'cheesy', 'cool', 'rock-score', 'dramatic', 'well-organized', 'plot', 'make', 'one', 'most', 'underrated', 'movie', 'recent', 'memory', 'classic', 'look', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'when', 'came', 'out']",N/A

The excitement behind the  Transformers seems to have been lost, with the Beast Wars cartoon offering  a pale comparison to the 80s splendor involved with the original crew of  Optimus, Megatron, Soundwave and the rest.  Transformers: The Movie sent  the Autobots and Decepticons in a new direction, with prominent characters  dying off from both sides, and a new enemy being revealed.  Vince DiCola  offers a soundtrack that is total cheese, but fits quite well with the 80s  glory that was the Transformers.  The list of guest voices is quite  impressive as well: Frasier's Dad, Monty Pythoner Eric Idle, and that  fast-talking guy from the old Micro-Machines commercials are just a few.

511701,AE2WZJ5OQR52R,B00001U0DX,A. Salazar,"[1, 2]","Like many others of my generation, I have many fond memories of the early to mid 80's cartoons.  Rushing home to catch Transformers, He-Man, Thundercats, GI Joe, Ultraman.  Saturdays had morning cartoons, Spider-man and his Amazing Friends, Superfriends and Kung-Fu theater...hell, sunday was the only day without cartoons back then until the Simpsons came out.  Something happened in the late 90's to 00's, it seemed cartoons weren't on tv as much anymore unless you had cable and Cartoon Network, or then only like an hour or so.  Most of these 80's cartoons are all out on dvd now, and it was finally time that Transformers had a proper and available release.Ok, so, you were either the right age when Transformers hit the screens (both big and small), or you just aren't really gonna be into it.  A decade or so later the new generation of Transformers came out, Beast Wars, Armada, Cybertron, Energon.  And you either were a total Transformers geek and loved them all, or they just weren't the same as the old school g1 series.  In any case, these get released on DVD, manufacturer's seem to do one print run, and that's it!So, Shout Factory has released the old g1 series, and an awesome looking box set as well.  Ok, so, where's the movie??  Well, fork over some big bucks for a new one, and you're lucky if it arrives (according to some of these reviews).  If you weren't hip enough to get it when it came out, you're s.o.l. right now.  And the movie is a bridge between the 2nd and 3rd season's.  Practically no main characters from season 1 & 2 return outside of Decepiticons.  It's an all new cast, story's, and even setting/time, as the movie is roughly 10 years later, and the 3rd season jumps in right after that.So, many may be wondering why it wasn't included in the box, and if there are plans for a Shout Factory re-release, which is what I was truly hoping for.  Well, tough luck peoples.  Sony still owns the rights, and while it seems pretty much every company seems to want to capitilize with double, triple, quadruple dippings, especially when a movie version, sequel or series re-vamp comes out, they got me wondering when they are gonna put this back out!!!!Well, I'll have to rely on memories for now, or do some hunting to find it out in a store somewhere.

511703,A36RRLVEBABY5Z,B00001U0DX,"Axel Law ""The Happy Seizure Kid""","[4, 6]","In the 1980s, it's no surprise that Transformers ruled television screens while simultaneously causing every kid to want to go out and buy the toys.  I am one of the ones that grew up watching my favorite Transformers duking it out for the fate of mankind.  I loved every minute of it, even if some of the episodes were really corny.  However, this review isn't about the show; it's about the movie, originally released in 1986.  The movie brought forth new circuits for us to admire while also killing off several of the old characters, including the beloved Optimus Prime.The animation is ten times more advanced than that of the original show.  Optimus Prime and Megatron have never looked sleaker and it's quite a shame they didn't last very long in the movie (well... Megatron turned to Galvatron... you get the idea.).  Even by today's standards, they haven't aged badly at all.  The voice cast is a list of well-known actors and most of them put in fine performances.  While Robert Stack's portrayal of Ultra Magnus seemed somewhat bland, Leonard Nimoy's portrayal of Galvatron was nothing less than excellent.  You also have to consider they were probably brought to the project based on the pay, not for the art.  Other actors included Judd Nelson as Hot Rod (another good voice performance), Lionel Stander as Kup, Eric Idle as Wreck-Gar (Yes, THAT Eric Idle), and of course, Casey Kasem and Scatman Crothers as Cliffjumper and Jazz, respectively.  But of course, let's not forget the legendary Orson Welles voicing the most bad(...) Transformer of them all: Unicron.  The planet eating monster that transforms from planet killer to robot and vice versa.  In fact, this was Orson Welles' final performance.  That means Transformers is the last credit on his resume.  How cool is that??The music score was contributed by Vince DiCola, back in the day when synthesized scores were becoming huge.  He previously did the score for ""Rocky IV"" and additional music for ""Staying Alive.""  I really like the score and it's quite a shame that Mr. DiCola has not done many film scores since.  Speaking of which, the DVD features an interview with him that's somewhat interesting for the diehard Transformers fan.  The songs are from largely unknown musicians; the most notables ones are Stan Bush, who did the songs ""Dare"" and the hit single ""The Touch,"" and Spectre General, who performed ""Nothin's Gonna Stand in my Way"" and ""Hunger.""  Spectre General is actually a pseudonym for Canadian rock band Kick Axe.  Sound familar now?  They did two albums and toured with Judas Priest before their breakup (they were also produced by Spencer Proffer, the producer of Quiet Riot, which explains his credit on the two songs).The storyline does seem a bit Star Wars-ish.  But seriously, who really cares?  And more importantly, what sci-fi HASN'T?  It does have a few holes and/or mistakes that seem like lazy writing (for example, jettisoning injured Decepticons to ""make room and less weight"" doesn't apply to space; it's called MASS), but the overall good versus evil story was pretty good.  It also sports some impressive dialogue like Springer's ""I've got better things to do tonight than die!"" or the infamous ""Ba Weep Granna Weep Nini Bang"" greeting the Junkions use.The infamous (...)has been restored back in the film.  The picture quality has been greatly enhanced and so has the sound quality.  Including the interview, the DVD comes with the original theatrical trailer and original storyboards.  My ONLY complaint with this DVD is that it doesn't come with a widescreen version.  Didn't Sunbow claim they found the widescreen print?  Why didn't Rhino include it?  Oh well.  Perhaps in the future.A memorable piece of 80s nostalgia and a must for diehard fans.  Looking back on it now, it's a pretty good animated film.  I must admit I almost cried when my favorite hero, Optimus Prime, bit the dust, but it's pretty awesome they brought him back at the end of Season 3.  Any Transformers fan will enjoy this.

The dialogue isn't great and the animation is not very fetching in some scenes, but for the most part it kept our attention and fed my son's appetite for every thing 'Transformers'.  The one troubling moment happens in the first 1/3 of the movie when one of the autobots delivers a shocking expletive.  In the 20 years since this movie debuted animated shows like South Park have elevated the swear word to an art form, but I wasn't quite prepared for that particular word to appear in this 1980's cartoon movie.  It is a bit awkward.  At least if it had been a bad guy I could have turned into a moral lesson about making bad choices; instead I was left to hope the boy had completely missed that line.  This isn't to say my son hasn't watched a movie here and there with questional language, but if he repeats the robot potty words in front of my wife I'm the one who is going to be in for it.

511711,A33WATQKA3FARE,B00001U0DX,Carl Peterson,"[5, 12]","With the new live-action Transformers movie due out next summer, Sony's trying to drum up excitement with an anniversary release of the animated movie on DVD. But no amount of special features can make up for an inferior transfer of the film itself. And the slew of special features are mostly not that special.VIDEO:With any DVD release, the video quality of the film is important. Sony has clearly dropped the ball in this department. The widescreen disc looks okay, but the color correction is not accurate and there is still a fair amount of dust visible. On the fullscreen disc, the movie is a mess. Colors are completely off with purples appearing as blackish reds and oranges appearing as yellows. And the contrast is way too high. Details are lost in deep shadows and overexposed highlights. There is also a lot of noise on the fullscreen version. This is disappointing because the fullscreen disc actually shows more of the animated image than the widescreen. This is because the film was animated 4:3 and cropped for the theatrical release. Why Sony couldn't have restored the fullscreen version and cropped that to create the widescreen version I can't imagine. In any event this release is sadly lacking in the video quality department.*NOTE: There IS one reason you might prefer this release to the previous Rhino DVD. If you have a high-definition, widescreen format TV, the widescreen transfer is overall easier to watch than selecting the 'stretch' option with the 4:3 Rhino release. Even though Sony's color correction isn't quite right, its formatting wins out. Just remember, the movie was animated 4:3 and cropped down for the widescreen theatrical version, so you're losing a fair amount of the image watching it widescreen. But for those who have a fancy TV and want the movie to fill it, this Transformers DVD is the way to go.EXTRAS:The extras are what any fan would request, but they're mostly handled poorly. The major exeption is the involvement of Nelson Shin (director), Flint Dille (story consultant) and Susan Blu (voice of Arcee). They offer their thoughts in a commentary track and in several featurettes. These are pretty cool. But they don't make up for the DVD's disappointing qualities.The original toy commercials are fun bonus features (some hidden as Easter Eggs), but Sony couldn't secure rights to the actors' likenesses, so all of the faces are blurred. And the commercials were taken from VHS tape which means the quality is decidedly inferior.The Scramble City bonus feature is also quite disappointing. Again, Sony couldn't secure some of the rights. This time they couldn't use the audio track. In its place is a mildly interesting fan commentary, but since the full version is availible (subtitled) on the internet, this is really fairly pointless.The test/deleted/alternative footage is nothing special either. One long shot of tiny Autobots surrounding a fallen Optimus Prime that had never been seen and several clips from the final film without an effect or two.

So you can imagine how excited I was to see Spike all grown up in, ""The Transformers - The Movie"".""Look, it's Unicron!""The movie opens with our introduction to the devastating, planet-eating robot, Unicron.  Voiced by the legendary Orson Welles (in his final performance), Unicron proves to be no match for any Autobot or Decepticon.""Roger me! Wilco me! Anything! Hello! Hello! Earth?!""Fortunately, it doesn't take long for Spike and his son Daniel to make their appearance.  I'll admit, seeing Spike as an adult, took some getting used to.  Especially, during the scene when Spike's spaceship is being attacked by Unicron, and Spike yells, ""Oh, s**t, what are we going to do?!""  If my mother knew that there was profanity in this movie, I don't think she would have been so anxious to drive me to the movie theater.""One shall stand, one shall fall!""This movie contains many epic battles, including the fight between Prime and Megatron.  I still think this is one of the best action sequences in motion picture history.  Watching Optimus Prime fall to Megatron was uncomfortable for me, mostly because Spike and Prime always seemed to be the closest of friends.  If it was painful for me to watch, I knew it would be painful for Spike.I don't want to give away too much of the plot, but I will say that the Autobot Matrix of Leadership is the only thing that can destroy Unicron.  Once Megatron is reborn as Galvatron (that's right, I said ""reborn""!... you'll just have to see the movie to know what I'm talking about), he will stop at nothing to get the Matrix of Leadership.  Can you blame him?  When a robot the size of a planet tells you to do something - you do it!You might want to take a nap before you watch ""The Transformers - The Movie"", because the climatic battle at the end of the movie will leave you exhausted.

But as it happens, this UK Madman release has extra features that rival even the U.S. Sony/ BMG DVD release.  Highlights include a Peter Cullen Q&A;, the alternate Star Wars-style opening, awesomely bad Stan Bush music video, lots of toy commercials, and a PDF file of the movie script.The only problem with all of this is that all of the extras are in PAL format and not compatible with U.S. players.  The version I bought of the movie was described as ""Region Free.""  That's kind of true, as the feature film is presented in 1080p 24fps and playable anywhere.  The special features are not, however, and I had to use computer software to be able to watch them.  When I try to launch a special feature from my PS3, nothing happens.So, with the bad news out of the way, I can say that I love this transfer.  First, it's genuine 1080 HD, certainly not upscaled (some YouTube uploads had me worried).  Second, it's unabashedly filthy.  Just the way I remember movie prints as a kid.  We're not talking Tarantino Grindhouse, here, it just feels like you snuck into the last theater left playing the movie.  It's refreshingly organic and fitting for an 80s cartoon.  Thanks to blu-ray, digital artifacts are minimal (nice to see after the digital mess on the U.S. DVD).  Even the many ""strobe light"" sections fare pretty well.Bad things: motion judder is apparent in panning/ zooming shots where it shouldn't be; anyone who thinks Rodimus should be red will be disappointed; some challenging scenes still show some MINOR compression artifacts (not noticeable and nowhere near the DVD releases); I would have liked to see a 4:3 option; that obnoxious PG logo on the front obscures the artwork like the movie's a pack of cigarettes.  And, as I said, the special features are PAL and won't play on U.S. players-- you'd have to rip the videos to your PC to play them.Odd bit of trivia: even though this disc is advertised as single layer, my PC reports the disc as using 28.78GB (blu-rays max out at ~25GB per layer).All in all I'm very satisfied with this release, especially considering there is no U.S. counterpart.

511719,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B00001U0DX,"Cloud ""...""","[4, 4]","Films like this are funny since waves of nostalgia completely hit you, remembering what toys you had, and how much of a pain they were, or just simply how awesome it was. While I was actually more a Beast Wars fan, Transformers always held that special place in my youth, along Ninja Turtles, G.I Joe, or Tiny Toons Adventures. Upon first release, this movie believe it or not was panned with many critics hating it. But as always, it developed into a cult film and people loved it. Released in a Anniversary edition, but also to tie in to the forthcoming live-action film, this is probably the best the film has ever looked and it helps since it's so awesome.A huge moon-sized Transformer named Unicron proceeds to completely engulf a moon base and mash it to pieces while absorbing it. Meanwhile, the Decepticons, led by Megatron, find a perfect opportunity to lead an assault against the Autobots. The battle has heavy casualities including a massive one in Optimus Prime. The Autobots find themselves chased by the Decepticons as well as the foreboding threat of Unicron.One cannot think of the Transformer movie without thinking of the death of Optimus Prime. This is essentially like if they wrote Bugs Bunny out of Warner Bros. cartoons or got rid of Mickey Mouse from Disney. While it most likely will infuriate diehards as well as bum out kids, it's handled extremely well and not done just to create false emotion. Oddly though I can't even remember when I first saw it but even being in my 20's, it's still quite a powerful scene.Does the movie fumble? Well, I guess in 2 areas: the music and the pacing. This movie just screams 80's made since there's quite a few cheesy hair metal-like songs including ""The Touch"" which I still can't stand. The film would've worked immensely better if it had a proper score rather than songs from bands who didn't even get one hit wonder status. As for the pacing, well the first act is awesome when we see an all-out battle with Autobots defending their city against the Decepticons. We get the aforementioned death as well as a great end to Megatron's scheming right hand man but after that it kind of falls apart. It's not that it's badly-written, it just doesn't have that sustainability the film started with.The extras are of course well worth it, unlike certain Anniversary Editions.

511724,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B00001U0DX,Cubist,"[3, 4]","For those of us who grew up watching the Transformers cartoon every day after school in the early 1980s, the movie came as quite a shock. Most of us, at that early, impressionable age, were unprepared for the much darker tone and the increased level of violence, including some of the show's most popular and beloved characters getting quickly killed off in the first few opening scenes. Transformers: The Movie was a commercial and critical failure but went on to develop a strong cult following among fans. Various incarnations of the movie have been released on DVD in various regions but this latest one, timed to celebrate the movie's 20th anniversary (has it been that long?), promises to be the definitive edition.On the first disc the film is presented in its theatrical aspect ratio.The ""Autobot Matrix of Knowledge"" allows you to watch the entire movie with the occasional factoid or bit of trivia appearing on the screen. These scraps of info, the DVD proudly proclaims, were ""supplied by the fans for the fans.""There is an audio commentary by director Nelson Shin, story consultant Flint Dille and the voice of Arcee Susan Blu. Shin tends to state what we are seeing but thankfully Dille and, to a lesser degree, Blu tend to dominate. They talk about the effect the death of Optimus Prime had on its fans back then and still 20 years later. This is an engaging trip down memory lane for all involved.The second commentary is by fans (and webmasters of Transformers fan sites) Rik Alvarez, Paul Hitchens, Joe Moore and Alex Weiner. One of them constantly refers to the screenplay and points out the differences from what we are seeing. These guys certainly know a lot about this movie (maybe too much) but their passion for it comes through loud and clear and this makes it a must-listen for any dedicated fan.There is a theatrical trailer and eight T.V. spots. It is a lot of fun to watch these vintage ads, including the toys that were made at the time.""Cinex and Credit Test"" features colour and exposure tests for the movie's opening credits.The ""Photo Gallery"" includes sketches and profiles of various characters. Also included are various designs for the Matrix.Finally, there is ""Scramble City with commentary"" as a couple of the guys from the fan commentary return to talk about this episode that only aired in Japan before the movie and that actually introduced several characters who went on to appear in it. It would have been nice to have been able to watch this without the accompanying commentary but this is a minor quibble.The second disc presents the film in its full screen aspect ratio which it was actually filmed in so you actually see more information. It is nice that we get a choice between both aspect ratios.""The Death of Optimus Prime"" takes a look at the demise of one of the most important characters in the series. They didn't realize the impact it would have on the fans and, in particular, children some of whom were traumatized by his death. In retrospect, they probably wouldn't have killed off Prime.""The Cast and Characters"" examines the voice actors who worked on the movie and how certain voices defined that particular character. Key crew members recount anecdotes about the famous voice talent.""Transformers Q&A;"" features key crew members revealing what their favourite scene is in the movie, how they named the characters, their favourite character and so on.""Deleted/Alternate Footage"" is presented with commentary by a couple of the participants from the fan commentary. One fan points out what this footage is, what was used and what wasn't. Also included is test footage with some of it in an unfinished form.Also included are ""Scramble City"" commercials, U.S. and Japanese toy commercials.Finally, there are ""Animated Storyboards"" for four scenes, including one cut scene.",5,The Special Edition Fans Have Been Waiting For,1163721600,"11 17, 2006",2006,3831,"['who', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'Transformers', 'cartoon', 'day', 'school', 'early', '1980s', 'movie', 'came', 'quite', 'shock', 'Most', 'early', 'impressionable', 'age', 'were', 'unprepared', 'much', 'darker', 'tone', 'increased', 'level', 'violence', 'including', 'show', 'most', 'popular', 'beloved', 'characters', 'getting', 'quickly', 'killed', 'off', 'first', 'few', 'opening', 'scenes', 'Transformers', 'Movie', 'was', 'commercial', 'critical', 'failure', 'went', 'develop', 'strong', 'cult', 'following', 'fans', 'Various', 'incarnations', 'movie', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'various', 'regions', 'latest', 'one', 'timed', 'celebrate', 'movie', '20th', 'anniversary', 'been', 'long', 'be', 'definitive', 'edition.On', 'first', 'film', 'presented', 'theatrical', 'aspect', 'ratio.The', 'Autobot', 'Matrix', 'Knowledge', 'watch', 'entire', 'movie', 'occasional', 'factoid', 'bit', 'trivia', 'appearing', 'screen', 'scraps', 'info', 'DVD', 'proudly', 'were', 'supplied', 'fans', 'fans', 'audio', 'commentary', 'director', 'Nelson', 'Shin', 'story', 'consultant', 'Flint', 'Dille', 'voice', 'Arcee', 'Susan', 'Blu', 'Shin', 'state', 'what', 'are', 'seeing', 'thankfully', 'Dille', 'lesser', 'degree', 'Blu', 'tend', 'dominate', 'talk', 'effect', 'death', 'Optimus', 'Prime', 'had', 'fans', 'back', 'then', 'still', '20', 'years', 'later', 'engaging', 'trip', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'involved.The', 'second', 'commentary', 'fans', 'webmasters', 'Transformers', 'fan', 'sites', 'Rik', 'Alvarez', 'Paul', 'Hitchens', 'Joe', 'Moore', 'Alex', 'Weiner', 'One', 'constantly', 'screenplay', 'points', 'out', 'differences', 'what', 'are', 'seeing', 'guys', 'certainly', 'know', 'lot', 'movie', 'maybe', 'too', 'much', 'passion', 'loud', 'clear', 'must-listen', 'dedicated', 'fan.There', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'eight', 'T.V', 'spots', 'lot', 'fun', 'watch', 'vintage', 'ads', 'including', 'toys', 'were', 'made', 'time', 'Cinex', 'Credit', 'Test', 'colour', 'exposure', 'tests', 'movie', 'opening', 'credits.The', 'Photo', 'Gallery', 'sketches', 'profiles', 'various', 'characters', 'Also', 'included', 'are', 'various', 'designs', 'Matrix.Finally', 'Scramble', 'City', 'commentary', 'couple', 'guys', 'fan', 'commentary', 'return', 'talk', 'episode', 'only', 'aired', 'Japan', 'movie', 'actually', 'introduced', 'several', 'characters', 'who', 'went', 'appear', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'watch', 'accompanying', 'commentary', 'minor', 'quibble.The', 'second', 'disc', 'film', 'full', 'screen', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'was', 'actually', 'filmed', 'so', 'actually', 'see', 'more', 'information', 'nice', 'get', 'choice', 'aspect', 'ratios', 'Death', 'Optimus', 'Prime', 'look', 'demise', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'characters', 'series', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'impact', 'would', 'have', 'fans', 'particular', 'children', 'whom', 'were', 'traumatized', 'death', 'retrospect', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'killed', 'off', 'Prime', 'Cast', 'Characters', 'voice', 'actors', 'who', 'worked', 'movie', 'how', 'certain', 'voices', 'defined', 'particular', 'character', 'Key', 'crew', 'members', 'recount', 'anecdotes', 'famous', 'voice', 'talent', 'Transformers', 'Q', 'A', 'key', 'crew', 'members', 'revealing', 'what', 'favourite', 'scene', 'movie', 'how', 'named', 'characters', 'favourite', 'character', 'so', 'Deleted/Alternate', 'Footage', 'presented', 'commentary', 'couple', 'participants', 'fan', 'commentary', 'One', 'fan', 'out', 'what', 'footage', 'what', 'was', 'used', 'what', 'was', ""n't"", 'Also', 'included', 'test', 'footage', 'unfinished', 'form.Also', 'included', 'are', 'Scramble', 'City', 'commercials', 'U.S.', 'Japanese', 'toy', 'commercials.Finally', 'are', 'Animated', 'Storyboards', 'four', 'scenes', 'including', 'one', 'cut', 'scene']",N/A

Let us take a look at the details of this dvd release which will help buyers in making the choice as to whether or not to make this film part of their dvd library.Firstly, this dvd is released by Sony BMG Music Entertainment, as therefore those who might be expecting a dvd release of the animated film together with the live action film later in 2007 will be sorely disappointed as the property doesn't belong to the same distributor.Secondly, this dvd release is a 2 disc release featuring three versions of the feature film, commentary tracks and interviews, a sneak peak at the live-action movie.A breakdown of the dvd details are as follows :*Brilliantly remastered and color-corrected*16x9 widescreen presentation, which has not been seen anywhere since the movie was in theatres twenty years ago*Full screen edition as well*Commentary tracks*Interviews with director Nelson Shin, story consultant Flint Dille and voice actress Susan Blu*Autobot Matrix of Knowledge Presentation: Truly showcasing the pop culture phenomenon that is The Transformers, Sony BMG has created a special version of the film for the DVD release.*The `Autobot Matrix of Knowledge' will feature trivia and fun facts about the movie itself, the Transformers brand, and the pop culture references in which Transformers has been spoofed/tributed. Approximately one hundred fun facts will show up on screen throughout the movie. Many of the factoids were provided by fans through a special DVD site created by Sony BMG to solicit input--marking the first time that the hugeTransformers fan base has ever been asked to participate in the creation of a Transformers home entertainment release.*Original commercials for the toy line and movie*Behind-the-scenes sneak peak at next summer's highly anticipated Transformers live action movie event. The special feature segment on the DVD will include comments from Michael Bay and Steven Spielberg who share their vision and passion for Transformers*Collectible `transforming' coverMy personal view is that for this price, and the amount of special features thrown in, this dvd is a real bang for your buck. If you are a Transformers fan, this is a must buy. If you wanna have a Transformers history lesson and get hyped up before the movie release, this is also a worthy consideration.If you belong to none of the people in the category above, you might wanna stay away.

But, from secret staging grounds on two of Cybertron's moons, the valiant Autobots plan to retake their homeland.""Ok, those reading this have probably already seen this movie, so I see no reason to describe it, I would rather answer some retorical questions:Q: Why isn't the Aerialbots and Stunticons and Combaticons or Jetfire in the movie?A: The script was being written when we were still watching the first 16 episodes of Season 1 in 1984 on Saturday mornings.  It wasn't until sometime during the second season that we started to see trailers for the movie due to come out in 1986.  Therefore some of the characters didn't exsist when the film was near completion.Q: One thing I didn't understand, if they could fix Kup and Ultra Magnus when they were hurt, why couldn't they fix Prime and the others?A: When Optimus Prime and other Autobots who died were shot, they wern't blasted apart, but fatally hit in vital circuts, much like a human being shot in single vital organs like the liver.  Kup and Ultra Magnus was mearly torn apart and could be repaired by skilled hands.  A truely lifeless Transformer has dark grey metal skin and colourless eyes.Now those who complain about the music, remember this is a kids movie made in the 1980's and I'm sure many of you have bought the soundtrack even if it's rather cheesy by today's standards. It's not that bad really.I give this DVD 3 stars out of five, while I give the movie 5 stars.  My reason for only 3 stars, is that the DVD was rushed rather than taking the time to insert the extras we were hoping for like the deleted scenes and 'The Touch' music video or Trailers and the lack of subtitles and language features.  The other reviewers were right, we would see these if Rhino Studios were true Transfans rather than cashing in on popular pop culture. But look on the bright side, it's better than the VHS release.

The transformers were a fad in the 80's that all the boys wanted, including me.  They would morph into random items and well, later on some of the robots morphed into some really weird stuff.  Anyway, this movie starts off with a planet full of robots being destroyed by a big, scary, evil planet named Unicron, voiced by the evil Orson Welles! How appropriate!  So pretty soon you see a battle taking place between the Autobots and the Decepticons.  You're introduced to an endless slew of robots with very &quot;clever&quot; at least the people who made them thought so, names.  While the robots are fighting you witness some of the WORST jokes ever to be burned on a DVD.  Like this one for example:(Fortress is shaking)  Jazz (voiced by Scatman!):  Hey, what's shaking? Besides  this fortress.Yeah, I know just awful, but you know, Pokemon's jokes aren't so great either.  Soon, you're introduced to optimus prime a huge robot who can morph into a truck who is feuding with Megatron, a deceptacon who can change to a gun who can't even fire himself(how useful is that?)  Megatron kills Prime, getting trashed himself in the process.  Unicron makes a deal with Megatron to get the matrix and he would give Megatron a new identity (plus a new villian to make all the kids buy).  The rest of the movie is pure history.  There is one scene I absolutely have to point out.  While the Auto bots are on some strange planet fighting other robots one of the bots they are fighting some some cheesy one liner, and his eye starts to sparkle!  This is the most cheesy thing I have ever witnessed and I was on the floor laughing.  After that they say something in a weird language and start break dancing to Weird Al music! CLASSIC!

We loved watching this movie as friends growing up even in high school, but by the end I was always mentally tired out from the blaring hard rock music played after each fight with screaming punk rock lyrics.But to me, even worse than that, the one (or two depending on which version you see) curse word that was mentioned in the movie was COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE and shameful for a movie that includes a large child audience (really doesn't need to be in any kind of movie but especially not a kids movie).  THAT is what really SHOCKED me more than anything else seeing this movie on video for the first time.  Some may think I sound behind the times in my thinking...to you I can only say flattery will get you nowhere ;)BUT, this movie does get three stars for it's sci fi story, it's animation, it's ties to the tv series linking the first generation lead by optimus prime (who dies in the beginning, making everyone back in 1986 mad) and the second generation lead by the new Rodimus Prime.

I remember the excitement of seeing all the new characters being introduced, the surprise at seeing so many old favorites killed, and the chills I felt as Optimus Prime died.  It was so much more than ""just a cartoon"", then and now.  My interest in Transformers has never waned, and I've never lost any of the excitement I felt for watching this movie.While mostly action, there is a depth to this work that so many other movies would love to claim to have.  And it's fun.  I loved the battle sequences and the bits of humor and the music.  I also own the soundtrack and, like the movie, I have enjoyed it constantly.Of course, it's not perfect.  It includes some of the flubs and inconsistencies that were a constant with the series, but none of these things detracted from enjoying the movie.Maybe the one negative I have with the movie is that it led to the poor third (and final) season of the series.  It's ironic that a movie that so many fans consider an amazing piece of work was followed by a season that was generally considered so weak.Overall, an amazing piece of animation with excellent characters and stories that can be enjoyed over and over again.

511745,AXFI7TAWD6H6X,B00001U0DX,Erica Anderson,"[4, 4]","I grew up on the animated series ""The Transformers"". The animation back then is considered outdated by today's standards and the writing is relatively cheesy yet entertaining. And of course due to popularity, there had to be a Transformers movie. Here the animation is vastly superior than the original series. Unfortunately in the movie a lot of classic characters were killed off to introduce new characters. When I first saw this movie as a kid, I was thoroughly disappointed to see Optimus Prime killed off as well as Prowl, Ironhide, Rachet, Wheeljack, etc..etc... . Thankfully the dinobots remained intact (although where the heck was Snarl the stegosaurus in the movie?) as well as Bumblebee, Jazz, and Cliffjumper (the few classic characters that remained on board). Of course on the decepticon side, some of my favorite characters were changed: Skywarp, Thundercracker and the Insecticons, and even Starscream when Galvatron (i.e Megatron finally got his revenge). I was thoroughly impressed that the movie producers managed to get legendary actor Orson Welles to play the  voice of the destructive planet/robot Unicron. Unlike the series, the movie takes a darker tone in the storyline by killing a good number of the original characters and intensifying the war between the Autobots and Decepticons, making the war more angst-ridden and filled with despair. And in the movie, the viewer sees a grown up Spike who has a son of his own. As far as new characters are concerned, I loved the introduction of new villains the Quintessans with their minions the Sharkticons. Again, I loved the improved animation in the movie. It adds a bit more depth to the characters themselves. The silly part of this movie I thought was when the autobots were leaving earth to escape Galvatron and his cronies was that they left behind Blaster and whatever remaining Autobots were left. Where was Skyfire? Or the Aerialbots? On the Decepticon side, the Combaticons? I know there are others but I just can't seem to name them at the moment. Nevertheless the movie is a good popcorn movie and pretty much remains faithful to the series despite the loss of some of my favorite characters.",5,A modern animated classic,1021075200,"05 11, 2002",2002,2177,"['grew', 'up', 'animated', 'series', 'Transformers', 'animation', 'back', 'then', 'considered', 'outdated', 'today', 'standards', 'writing', 'relatively', 'cheesy', 'yet', 'entertaining', 'course', 'due', 'popularity', 'had', 'be', 'Transformers', 'movie', 'Here', 'animation', 'vastly', 'superior', 'original', 'series', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', 'lot', 'classic', 'characters', 'were', 'killed', 'off', 'introduce', 'new', 'characters', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'movie', 'kid', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'disappointed', 'see', 'Optimus', 'Prime', 'killed', 'off', 'as', 'well', 'Prowl', 'Ironhide', 'Rachet', 'Wheeljack', 'etc..etc', 'Thankfully', 'dinobots', 'remained', 'intact', 'where', 'heck', 'was', 'Snarl', 'stegosaurus', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'Bumblebee', 'Jazz', 'Cliffjumper', 'few', 'classic', 'characters', 'remained', 'board', 'course', 'decepticon', 'side', 'favorite', 'characters', 'were', 'changed', 'Skywarp', 'Thundercracker', 'Insecticons', 'even', 'Starscream', 'when', 'Galvatron', 'i.e', 'Megatron', 'finally', 'got', 'revenge', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'impressed', 'movie', 'producers', 'managed', 'get', 'legendary', 'actor', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'play', 'voice', 'destructive', 'planet/robot', 'Unicron', 'series', 'movie', 'darker', 'tone', 'storyline', 'killing', 'good', 'number', 'original', 'characters', 'intensifying', 'war', 'Autobots', 'Decepticons', 'making', 'war', 'more', 'angst-ridden', 'filled', 'despair', 'movie', 'viewer', 'grown', 'up', 'Spike', 'who', 'son', 'own', 'As', 'far', 'new', 'characters', 'are', 'concerned', 'loved', 'introduction', 'new', 'villains', 'Quintessans', 'minions', 'Sharkticons', 'Again', 'loved', 'improved', 'animation', 'movie', 'bit', 'more', 'depth', 'characters', 'silly', 'part', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'when', 'autobots', 'were', 'leaving', 'earth', 'escape', 'Galvatron', 'cronies', 'was', 'left', 'behind', 'Blaster', 'remaining', 'Autobots', 'were', 'left', 'Where', 'was', 'Skyfire', 'Aerialbots', 'Decepticon', 'side', 'Combaticons', 'know', 'are', 'others', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'name', 'moment', 'movie', 'good', 'popcorn', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'faithful', 'series', 'loss', 'favorite', 'characters']",N/A

Lam,"[1, 1]","I just recently purchased this remastered version of Transformers: the Movie and I was pretty impressed with the color correction that brightened up and revealed more of what to see on the characters, planets, moons, and surroundings. Yet some shaded areas deserved to remain untouched to show definition between light and dark areas. The new underwater ripple effect with Hot Rod and Kup looks really good and they cleared up that orange yellow underwater haze from the original.As far back as I remember before the animated movie, the Transformers made their first commercial televised appearance promoting the release of their debut in a 4-part comic book mini-series from Marvel Comics. That commercial caught my attention when I was a kid back in the 80's, the comic book made a huge impact for a marketable toy product line which led to a 3-part animated mini-series that prompted for the animated series for several seasons to the height of the Transformers' popularity for the animated movie that continued the animated series for several more seasons until the Transformers popularity died down. Until 2004 and last year, the Transformers were reactivated by IGW Publishing that relaunched their popularity for alternate versions of the G1 Transformers which leads us to the remastered version and the upcoming live-action movie for 2007. (Whew! Who's up for a coffee break?)Yet it's hard to believe it has been 20 years since ""The Movie"" was released in theaters in the summer of 1986. It didn't draw a high box office rating when I was one of a few mid-teen year olds watching this movie in a theater that recently closed down which became another Good Guys store that recently closed down as well.  Normally any moviegoer would've expected a movie that earned critcal acclaim after several decades would get an anniversary re-release, but the Transformers? Come on, be serious! ""Heavy Metal"" would be acceptional but, those Autobots and Decepticons skyrocketed to popculture status.I've only seen a few of the bonus features so I don't want to ruin it for anyone else who plan on purchasing this item. Not like how the other reviewers have done, several leading characters were killed off especially, the big shocker on the Death of Optimus Prime, I've seen the preview on Amazon showing the cast and crew discussing their roles in the movie. So I have yet to see the rest.In a movie theater, the live-action trailer came up when I was going to see ""Pirates Of The Caribbean 2"". I started laughing in embarrassment and disbelief going, ""Oh my god!"" when the Transformers title came up. It's like, they can't be serious! I wasn't sure if I would see it when it comes out. As for the live-action ""sneak peek,"" Steven Spielberg and Michael Bay summed up what they had in mind about their movie project. And I was surprised they were very serious about making this movie to be believeable as possible. The robots will look similar in design to Robocop 2 but not how they appear in the comics and animation.

Worst part is they write a stupid ending and managed to kill of several of the best Transformers most notable is Optimus Prime. The Transformers series was a great show between good vs. evil with the good guys winning at the end. However, somebody forgot to tell the writers that. The animation is great but meaningless after Optimus Prime dies the life of movie was slowly slipping away. Most fans hate this movie and I can see why when it could have clearly been written better. The series continued after this movie but became less popular and drove fans toward other cartoon shows that dont kill of the good guys!!Not much as plot goes, the writers seem to make the moviesas they went along. Optimus Primes and Autobots getattacked by the Decepticons near their home base.Optimus tries to protect Ultra Magnus then gets killed.Megatron is also fatally wounded.Megatron then gets thrown out like scrap metal only to berecreated by Unicron (Orson Welles) as Galvatron.Galvatron then sneaks attacks and kills Lord Starscream(Chris Latta) in one of the films most popular but weak scene.That kinda describes the whole movie it seems to be a bigcommerical for the series. Yes the animation is wonderfuland the score is incredible, but the movie is wasted becauseits just a marketing ploy for Hasbro to reep the Transformersfranchise for all its worth.The writers of the series then saw their mistakes and ofcourse brought back Optimus and even brought back StarScreamfor several eps following the movie.The movies does introduce a couple of key character the Quintessons another robotic race that created the Autobotsand Decepticons but then became evil and basically want to rulethe universe.",2,The beginning of the end of the Transformers in US,1091750400,"08 6, 2004",2004,1886,"['seeing', 'movie', 'many', 'other', 'fans', 'could', 'only', 'draw', 'one', 'conclusion', 'guys', 'who', 'made', 'film', 'made', 'clearly', 'money', 'capitalize', 'popularity', 'Transformers', 'Worst', 'part', 'write', 'stupid', 'ending', 'managed', 'kill', 'several', 'best', 'Transformers', 'most', 'notable', 'Optimus', 'Prime', 'Transformers', 'series', 'was', 'great', 'show', 'good', 'vs.', 'evil', 'good', 'guys', 'winning', 'end', 'However', 'somebody', 'forgot', 'tell', 'writers', 'animation', 'great', 'meaningless', 'Optimus', 'Prime', 'life', 'movie', 'was', 'slowly', 'slipping', 'away', 'Most', 'fans', 'hate', 'movie', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'when', 'could', 'have', 'clearly', 'been', 'written', 'better', 'series', 'continued', 'movie', 'became', 'less', 'popular', 'drove', 'fans', 'other', 'cartoon', 'shows', 'dont', 'kill', 'good', 'guys', 'Not', 'much', 'plot', 'writers', 'seem', 'make', 'moviesas', 'went', 'along', 'Optimus', 'Primes', 'Autobots', 'getattacked', 'Decepticons', 'home', 'base.Optimus', 'tries', 'protect', 'Ultra', 'Magnus', 'then', 'killed.Megatron', 'also', 'fatally', 'then', 'thrown', 'out', 'scrap', 'metal', 'only', 'berecreated', 'Unicron', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'Galvatron.Galvatron', 'then', 'attacks', 'kills', 'Lord', 'Starscream', 'Chris', 'Latta', 'one', 'films', 'most', 'popular', 'weak', 'scene.That', 'whole', 'movie', 'be', 'bigcommerical', 'series', 'Yes', 'animation', 'score', 'incredible', 'movie', 'wasted', 'becauseits', 'just', 'marketing', 'ploy', 'Hasbro', 'reep', 'Transformersfranchise', 'worth.The', 'writers', 'series', 'then', 'saw', 'mistakes', 'brought', 'back', 'Optimus', 'even', 'brought', 'back', 'StarScreamfor', 'several', 'eps', 'following', 'movie.The', 'movies', 'introduce', 'couple', 'key', 'character', 'Quintessons', 'robotic', 'race', 'created', 'Autobotsand', 'Decepticons', 'then', 'became', 'evil', 'basically', 'want', 'rulethe', 'universe']",N/A

And I was a tad jealous since they were so cool and could transform into such neat stuff. So I never saw the movie when it was originally released. But since the Michael Bay movie is coming out next year I just had to see this. And WOW!!! Conceptually, it was so ahead of its time. I can only imagine if the TV series had come out now. I'm impressed. The animation is terrific. When I think of all the more recent animated features released over the past couple of years, this classic has to be the most clever and inventive. Despite the archaic methods, the transformations are superb. And who would have thought of a planet that could transform and behave the way Unicron does? Just amazing. I knew I wanted this DVD when I saw that it was being released. I wanted to see Optimus Prime. I love singing the theme song when no one else is around me. It's so distinct. But I loved the movie. This film is particularly good if you're unfamiliar with the TV series or the characters or what transpired in the film. Despite not having seen the film until now, I knew what happened because all the boys on my school bus talked about it so much. So I'm happy that I've finally seen it and I now know what all of the hype was about firsthand. I would definitely recommend this to those that plan on seeing the 2007 movie. It's just brings back great memories of growing up in the 80's. So many great things came out of that era and the Transformers have to be one of the highlights.

With a twist-laden storyline and detailed animation (during its time), Transformers the Movie blew me away when I first saw as a kid. Fast forward years later and it still blows me away. The creators were brave enough to kill off the popular characters so you have a sense of unpredictability and they also made the Decepticons more sinister and less fumbling than the series.  The voices of Orson Welles, Leonard Nimoy, Eric Idle, Robert Stack, Judd Nelson, among others add a ""bigness'"" in the movie. The soundtrack, though cheesy, is a sheer guilty pleasure. From the title track that antedates The Darkness to the Van Halen/Survivor sounding songs of Stan Bush, Dare and The Touch (which resurfaced as the song being recorded by Mark Wahlberg in Boogie Nights), it is a perfect companion to the blistering action of the Autobots vs. Decepticons.

I saw this movie twice-- the second time, because I was too scared to go see ALIENS..As a kid back then, i was totally into going to see this film-- and I was not disappointed--I felt the death of PRIME was done tastefully-- I felt then, as I do now, that comic-book/animated action shows should deal more directly with the consequences of violence, that sometimes people DO get hurt and die-- the anti-injury imperatives imposed on most post-70's animated US shows are potentially more injurious in terms of perception of reality, than the reality that some people feel they're protecting kids from--Enough ranting-- this film introduced many ""new"" characters into the Transformers canon, including Kup, Hot Rod, Galvatron, and more-- Most importantly, Arcee, the female Autobot, makes her debut!  You would think that all the Transformers were monks!  Also, like Optimus Prime, many characters meet their final fate in this film-- Such is the nature of war...  The Autobots' human sidekick Spike was college-aged during the TV show; in the movie, he's all grown-up, with a son, Daniel.  Like his father, Daniel is drawn into the Autobot/Decepticon war whether he likes it or not... Spike even gets to utter a mild expletive, which caused a few laughs in the original theatrical version (it was excised from the original VHS home version)..The planet-sized threat of Unicron is reminiscent of the character Galactus in Marvel Comics' FANTASTIC FOUR comics.. Seemingly omnipotent, granting powers to those who will do his bidding, and needing the energy of entire planets to survive...  The connection is made even more curious when one considers that Marvel's Animation Studio in L.A. was key in co-producing the TV series, along with Hasbro's SunBow productions.Unfortunately, even the celebrity voices in the cast (Star Trek's Leonard Nimoy, Judd Nelson in his brat-pack heyday, and the legendary Orson Welles) couldn't make this film a hit at the box office.  The toy tie-ins were obvious, and, to many, this film just smacked of commercial exploitation.. But to fans of the show, it was way beyond a simple excuse to say ""buy this stuff!""On top of all that, is the sobering reality that in the United States, animation, as a story-telling form, is seemingly cursed to be perceived as only valid for telling stories to children.  in Japan, anime' has long been an accepted element of adult-consumed pop-culture.  But even the technically excellent TITAN A.E. (produced by the now-defunct 20th Century Fox Animation Studios) could not escape reaching only animation cultists at the box-office.  Certain inroads have been made-- for example, the SIMPSONS TV show has been a hit with adults for well over a decade now-- and the recent success of Dreamworks' SHREK 1 & 2 and Disney/Pixar's collaborations (Toy Story, Finding Nemo, Bug's Life, The Impossibles) has revealed that adult appeal and animation don't have to be at odds with each other..A Japanese-produced sequel to THE TRANSFORMERS has been airing on cable and is being produced for home video now-- Perhaps, if it is a big enough hit, we may see a long-delayed sequel in the franchise...",4,Excellent fantasy action film!

After three delays it finally arrived and I was thouroughly impressed. First off the movie itself is crystal clear it's almost like they stripped a layer of the film off and recolored it. Second the sound quality is good, not fully surround but much better than the vhs version before. I wish there could have been more extra features like vintage commercials and preveiws, but there are deleted scene storyboards, and a interveiw with Vince DiCola, the movies composer. I highly recomend this DVD version for all of you Transformers fans, or if you are just a fan of great animation. I've really enjoyed showing this movie to some of the children I know, who are stuck with todays &quot;crap&quot; cartoons, instead of the gems from 15 years ago,(Transformers, G.I.

511764,AX11CD4P4VXPX,B00001U0DX,"jcb02 ""jcb02""","[18, 44]","In 1986 I was awash in anticipation over Transformers: The Movie.  Like every other kid, I had a ton of worn out Decepticons and Autobots, and I watched the television show religiously.  For kids like me, the movie promised a watershed moment in the continuity of the story.I watched this film on DVD for the first time since I saw it in the theater this past week.  I remember being extremely let down by the film as an 11 year old, and I was curious if time, and the knowledge that Optimus doesn't really die, would make it cooler for me.  Alas, no such luck was to be had.The biggest problem is that by slaughtering most of the existing characters in the first twenty minutes, you are left watching a bunch of robots you never saw before or give much of a rat's behind about, Dinobots excepted.  Hot Rod?  Ultra who?  Compounding the problem was the suspicion I had even at 11 that the creators were killing off the old simply to make room for the new on the show and hence force me to buy them.  Need proof this was a bad move?  A near fan revolt convinced the creators to resurrect Optimus at the end of the next season.  And speaking of dead Autobots, I could have sworn I saw a number of them take much more abuse on the show and survive!  In the movie, several are felled by wimpy blasts from the individual Constructicons!  And just to address your argument, simply because you can get away with more in the theater doesn't mean you should sacrifice continuity.Another complaint- by that point in the continuity, there were a lot more transformers that didn't have any part in the flick. Devastator was the only one of several really big robots to make an appearance. They could have brought out all of them to take on Unicron.  Where is Omega Supreme when you need him?The rest of the story was not much better.  Why were the Quintessons there at the time?  It was also repetitive... how many times did Glavatron think he had destroyed the Matrix only to be tortured by Unicron? Did anyone else find the Junkions incredibly annoying? Or Daniel?  U Got the Touch is a God awful song.  The theme for Unicron is lifted directly from the Drago theme in Rocky IV.Most reviewers love this movie, so rock on guys, but my advice to someone who is thinking about purchasing this to relive their childhood is- get season 1 instead!",1,"sorry fellas, but it was a turkey then and is now",1092268800,"08 12, 2004",2004,2331,"['1986', 'was', 'awash', 'anticipation', 'Transformers', 'Movie', 'other', 'kid', 'had', 'ton', 'worn', 'out', 'Decepticons', 'Autobots', 'watched', 'television', 'show', 'religiously', 'kids', 'movie', 'promised', 'watershed', 'moment', 'continuity', 'story.I', 'watched', 'film', 'DVD', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'theater', 'past', 'week', 'remember', 'being', 'extremely', 'let', 'down', 'film', '11', 'year', 'old', 'was', 'curious', 'time', 'knowledge', 'Optimus', ""n't"", 'really', 'die', 'would', 'make', 'cooler', 'Alas', 'such', 'luck', 'was', 'be', 'had.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'slaughtering', 'most', 'existing', 'characters', 'first', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'are', 'left', 'watching', 'bunch', 'robots', 'never', 'saw', 'give', 'much', 'rat', 'behind', 'Dinobots', 'excepted', 'Hot', 'Rod', 'Ultra', 'who', 'Compounding', 'problem', 'was', 'suspicion', 'had', 'even', '11', 'creators', 'were', 'killing', 'off', 'old', 'simply', 'make', 'room', 'new', 'show', 'hence', 'force', 'buy', 'Need', 'proof', 'was', 'bad', 'move', 'near', 'fan', 'revolt', 'convinced', 'creators', 'resurrect', 'Optimus', 'end', 'next', 'season', 'speaking', 'dead', 'Autobots', 'could', 'have', 'sworn', 'saw', 'number', 'take', 'much', 'more', 'abuse', 'show', 'survive', 'movie', 'several', 'are', 'felled', 'wimpy', 'blasts', 'individual', 'Constructicons', 'just', 'address', 'argument', 'simply', 'can', 'get', 'away', 'more', 'theater', ""n't"", 'mean', 'should', 'sacrifice', 'continuity.Another', 'complaint-', 'point', 'continuity', 'were', 'lot', 'more', 'transformers', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'part', 'flick', 'Devastator', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'several', 'really', 'big', 'robots', 'make', 'appearance', 'could', 'have', 'brought', 'out', 'take', 'Unicron', 'Where', 'Omega', 'Supreme', 'when', 'need', 'rest', 'story', 'was', 'not', 'much', 'better', 'Why', 'were', 'Quintessons', 'there', 'time', 'was', 'also', 'repetitive', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'did', 'Glavatron', 'think', 'had', 'destroyed', 'Matrix', 'only', 'be', 'tortured', 'Unicron', 'Did', 'anyone', 'else', 'find', 'Junkions', 'incredibly', 'annoying', 'Daniel', 'U', 'Got', 'Touch', 'God', 'awful', 'song', 'theme', 'Unicron', 'lifted', 'directly', 'Drago', 'theme', 'Rocky', 'IV.Most', 'reviewers', 'love', 'movie', 'so', 'rock', 'guys', 'advice', 'someone', 'who', 'thinking', 'purchasing', 'relive', 'childhood', 'is-', 'get', 'season', '1', 'instead']",N/A

511767,ATS1HA5M3EPZ4,B00001U0DX,"J. Elmquist ""Moviephile""","[0, 0]","Believe it or not, The Transformers is an exercise in rebellious filmmaking.  Take a cartoon children's show about robots from another planet that can change into vehicles (yeah we all liked it, even though we were a little older) beef up the animation, get some high talent voices, give it a Heavy Metal soundtrack, actually kill some of the characters (yes, I said kill) and what have you got?  Well it beats me but it works.  This movie was a marketing ploy (as well as a big toy commercial) to change the guard of the Transformers characters.  When I said earlier that they killed some of the characters, I mean some of the main characters.  And not just power down type of deaths, these were deaths caused by war.  This movie is violent in places, but not bloody.  The implications of the Decepticons as they kill their do good Autobot enemies is down right classic.  They kill without thought, and the Autobots defend and die without concern for themselves.  They truly are heroes as much as the Decepticons are villains.  The movie is simply about a large planet eating moon, voiced by Orson Wells (yes, THAT Orsen Wells).  It is traversing the galaxy chomping everything that is getting in its way.  Of course its heading straight for Cybertron, the Transformers home planet.  In the middle of the Autobot/Decepticon War no less.  The first battle that takes place on Earth is furious, having only to do with the war.  When the Autobots learn of the Planet eater, they start for home  immediately.  They run into trouble along the way, keeping the action quota way up.  The lead role, Hot Rod, voiced by Judd Nelson, is slick and skilled, but young and immature.  Its obvious what's going to happen to him later (no he doesn't die).  The lead Decepticon is voiced by Lenord Nimoy, joyfully overplaying the voice role of a bad guy, and he does it so well.  In any case, there is plenty of action until the final showdown where the planet eater shows there's more to him then meets the eye (sorry, no pun intended).  The movie starts to slip toward the last quarter, the animation declines a bit, as if they may have been running out of money.  But overall, this movie is entertaining and a blast to watch.

511780,A2E1QTFS01GT4P,B00001U0DX,"J. Urban ""U2fan4ever76""","[8, 11]","It never seems to amaze me anymore with 2-disc ""Special Editions"". Not only is the release an insult to all of those fans who have already bought the regular DVD edition, but there really isn't anything ""special"" about it. All of the ""special features"" could have been included on the original release as all, but the 2007 Movie material, was available at that time as well. As we all know the movie, let me say that the remastering is what you are paying for and will be happy. The colors are corrected and the image is very sharp. Now what the marketing people would have you believe you are paying full DVD price for is as follows:Original theatrical trailer and TV spots--This is to be expected and the TV spots are very redundant (as they usually are)Cinex and credit tests--Perhaps one of the biggest wastes of time and effort for a dvd. If anyone understands what this is or why it was put on a dvd I would love to know. (All you see is the various intro credits and original test sheets--no animation or any real point. If you want to see ""Leonard Nimoy"" handwritten on a credit sheet, then see the name appear as it did in the credits, then this ""special feature"" is for you!Photo gallery--Designs of the various Transformers with information on them. Standard fair and not all that interesting, especially trying to squint and read the text next to the photos.""Scramble City"" episode with fan commentary--This could have been REAL good, I mean REAL good--WITHOUT the fan commentary. In fact, there is no audio from the episode. All you hear is the fan's talking somewhat intelligently about a Japan-only episode that was released before Transformers: The Movie was released in Japan. (Note: It was released in Japan in 1987, so this Japan episode bridges the gap between the 1st and 2nd season Transformers and the movie.) This episode gives you a glimpse of a lot of the Transformers that first appeared in the movie over here in the states. One scene shows Optimus and Ultra Magnus together--which over here in the states, didn't happen until Prime's death in the movie. Likewise, you will see some epic battles of the various ""combiners""--the Constructicons, Stunticons, Combaticons, etc., and the first appearance of Metroplex--in the states, he didn't appear until after the movie. This would have been perfect had it contained the original sound effects and subtitles. As it stands, you here two fanboys talk during the whole episode.Remastering side-by-side comparison--Interesting, but it gets old after about a minute. It basically makes it appear that the remaster process was more of a ""brightening"" process than anything else--as the images appear more bright in the remastered version.Trailer: Transformers live action film--A teaser trailer that was in the theaters a while back. It briefly shows what appears to be a Decepticon towards the end, but apparently the CGI was not yet complete at the time this teaser came out--so it is more of a second glance and a shadow.Sneak peek: Transformers live action film--Literally, about one minute long. This has a quick ""I always thought Transformers would make a great film"" line from Spielberg, some non-CGI crash scenes (showing scenes of the actual actors reacting to non-existent effects). Nothing here to wet the appetite really.Next generation video game trailer--Not even a Transformers game!!  Some generic new PS3 game!Featurette: ""Death of Optimus Prime""--Features the original producers, a writer, and the woman who played Arcee talking about how surprised they were that Prime's death really mattered to people. My favorite part is when they said something to the effect of ""We were just trying to kill off a toyline so we could start the next generation of toys."" They also talk about the parents' complaints about Prime's death and how it affected their kids. Again, this would have been great had there been something that appeared to show that Prime's death was written as an important plot point rather than killing off an old toy line.Featurette: ""Cast and Characters""--The same crew above talk about what it was like working with various actors--somewhat interesting.Featurette: ""Transformers Q & A""--Probably the best ""featurette"" as there were some decent questions and answers--but still, you could tell they were trying to fill the 2nd DVD to justify the price.Promotional trailer with commentary--Worth one look. Beyond that, not much.Test, deleted/alternate footage with commentary--This is where one would think the meat of a ""special edition"" would be, but there is nothing that stands out. You see some alternate (read:  unfinished scenes) with commentary over the scenes, so you really can't hear the scenes. Likewise, there is such a subtle addition or change from the original version that you can't tell really what has been deleted even with the commentator yapping away.Animated storyboards--Interesting again for one view. The ""cut scene"" was nothing spectacular.US and Japanese toy commercials--low quality vhs versions of the commercials. It was cool seeing the first few, but then it was redundant. Likewise, what was up with the blurred children's faces? Is it illegal to show kids from commercials that appeared in the '80's?""Scramble City"" commercials--Pathetic!All in all, wait till this is a $9.99 DVD and buy it for the 1st disc that has the remastered version. The animated menus are nice, but there is very little substance here. It was a quick way to get $16-20 out of Transformers' fans again!",3,"Movie is 5 Stars, 20th Anniversary DVD is 3 Stars",1163376000,"11 13, 2006",2006,5510,"['never', 'amaze', 'anymore', '2-disc',

One of the most memorable is ""Transformers"", and not surprisingly ""Transformers"" is still as popular, and maybe even more so today than it was back then.  What was great about this series is that it gave every kid what they always wanted to see, giant robots fighting alongside humans in an intergalactic struggle for control.  The show was so popular that in 1987 it was adapted into a feature film, ""Transformers: The Movie"".""Transformers: The Movie"" takes the basic story of the tv show and kicks it into high gear.  This time however, the Decepticons are not the only enemy the Autobots must face off against, now their's an even greater threat to not only the Transformers but to all of the galaxy.  This new threat is Unicron (voiced by Orson Welles).  Unicron is a world eating, super Transformer that does not play sides, it eats anything that it wants.  Now it is up to Autobots to not only thwart the Decepticons, but also protect themselves and Earth from annihilation at the hands of Unicron.""Transformers: The Movie"" served as a great turning point in the animated tv series, as it introduced several new characters and eliminated a few others to really shake things up.  Since this was a film to be released to theaters the story was more mature to appeal to a bigger audience than just fans of the tv show.  The original theatrical release, as it turns out, was a slightly watered down version of the original film.  There was some blood and a little more language removed from the theatrical release so as not to offend parents of small children.  When the film was finally released to DVD these deleted items had been reinserted into the film so that audiences could watch the movie as it was intended.Superb voice acting and great storytelling makes for an enjoyable ride, even if you haven't seen much of the tv show, you can easily catch on to what is occuring in the movie.""Transformers: The Movie"" is rated PG for animated violence and brief language.",5,More Than Meets the Eye...,1120262400,"07 2, 2005",2005,2121,"['Speaking', 'viewpoint', 'someone', 'was', 'born', 'raised', '1980', 'were', 'several', 'key', 'cartoons', 'shaped', 'childhood', 'memories', 'One', 'most', 'memorable', 'Transformers', 'not', 'surprisingly', 'Transformers', 'still', 'popular', 'maybe', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'today', 'was', 'back', 'then', 'What', 'was', 'great', 'series', 'gave', 'kid', 'what', 'always', 'wanted', 'see', 'giant', 'robots', 'fighting', 'alongside', 'humans', 'intergalactic', 'struggle', 'control', 'show', 'was', 'so', 'popular', '1987', 'was', 'adapted', 'feature', 'film', 'Transformers', 'Movie', 'Transformers', 'Movie', 'basic', 'story', 'tv', 'show', 'kicks', 'high', 'gear', 'time', 'however', 'Decepticons', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'Autobots', 'must', 'face', 'off', 'now', 'even', 'greater', 'threat', 'not', 'only', 'Transformers', 'galaxy', 'new', 'threat', 'Unicron', 'voiced', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'Unicron', 'world', 'eating', 'super', 'Transformer', 'not', 'play', 'sides', 'anything', 'Now', 'Autobots', 'not', 'only', 'thwart', 'Decepticons', 'also', 'protect', 'Earth', 'annihilation', 'hands', 'Unicron', 'Transformers', 'Movie', 'served', 'great', 'turning', 'point', 'animated', 'tv', 'series', 'introduced', 'several', 'new', 'characters', 'eliminated', 'few', 'others', 'really', 'shake', 'things', 'up', 'was', 'film', 'be', 'released', 'theaters', 'story', 'was', 'more', 'mature', 'appeal', 'bigger', 'audience', 'just', 'fans', 'tv', 'show', 'original', 'theatrical', 'release', 'out', 'was', 'slightly', 'watered', 'down', 'version', 'original', 'film', 'was', 'blood', 'little', 'more', 'language', 'removed', 'theatrical', 'release', 'so', 'not', 'offend', 'parents', 'small', 'children', 'When', 'film', 'was', 'finally', 'released', 'DVD', 'deleted', 'items', 'had', 'been', 'reinserted', 'film', 'audiences', 'could', 'watch', 'movie', 'was', 'intended.Superb', 'voice', 'acting', 'great', 'storytelling', 'enjoyable', 'ride', 'even', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'much', 'tv', 'show', 'can', 'easily', 'catch', 'what', 'occuring', 'movie', 'Transformers', 'Movie', 'rated', 'PG', 'animated', 'violence', 'brief', 'language']",N/A

I am yet another one of the millions of bona fide Transformers fans out there who can tell you that this movie is one of the best animated movies ever made.  A solid story, strong voice cast, excellent animation by the Japanese artists, and engaging and appropriate soundtrack by Vince Di Cola. I have to say that I don't know any other movie in which the music meshs so well with the actual movie. Very well done.

Corn ""reviewer""","[1, 1]","To be perfectly clear here, this review is CO-WRITTEN by a person who loved Transformers when they were at the height of their popularity. If you had a kid like that, your house was probably filled with various transformers, some of which linked together to make one HUGE transformer.I never fully appreciated the appeal of these toys but their power, their magic was indisputable. Day and night, they were a favorite toy, providing hours of imaginative play. If you were crazy about Transformers (or had a kid who was) you should relate to this review.Anyway, according to my co-writer, who still has a serious attack of nostalgia when it comes to Transformers, the newest movie ""sucks"" and this old version ""rules"". I'll concede to his opinion. I do know that the toys became popular after the tv show became a favorite of kids and, from that point on, names like Optimus Prime and Decepticon rolled off the tongues of my kids (all males) as they started collecting them like mad.Anyway, if you found the newest movie a disappointment, give this one a try. It certainly held the attention of a group of adult males who were suffering from some serious nostalgia (and disappointment) after seeing the newest movie. This one relieved some of that pain.So take that for what its worth - and see what YOU think.Also, check out these:Transformers Movie Leader Optimus PrimeTransformers: The Ultimate Guide: The Ultimate Guide (Transformers)Transformers Movie Leader Megatron",5,Compare this to the latest movie (2007) and this one RULES!,1183507200,"07 4, 2007",2007,1471,"['be', 'perfectly', 'clear', 'here', 'review', 'CO-WRITTEN', 'person', 'who', 'loved', 'Transformers', 'when', 'were', 'height', 'popularity', 'had', 'kid', 'house', 'was', 'probably', 'filled', 'various', 'transformers', 'linked', 'together', 'make', 'one', 'HUGE', 'transformer.I', 'never', 'fully', 'appreciated', 'appeal', 'toys', 'power', 'magic', 'was', 'indisputable', 'Day', 'night', 'were', 'favorite', 'toy', 'providing', 'hours', 'imaginative', 'play', 'were', 'crazy', 'Transformers', 'had', 'kid', 'who', 'was', 'should', 'relate', 'review.Anyway', 'according', 'co-writer', 'who', 'still', 'serious', 'attack', 'nostalgia', 'when', 'Transformers', 'newest', 'movie', 'sucks', 'old', 'version', 'rules', ""'ll"", 'concede', 'opinion', 'do', 'know', 'toys', 'became', 'popular', 'tv', 'show', 'became', 'favorite', 'kids', 'point', 'names', 'Optimus', 'Prime', 'Decepticon', 'rolled', 'off', 'tongues', 'kids', 'males', 'started', 'collecting', 'mad.Anyway', 'found', 'newest', 'movie', 'disappointment', 'give', 'one', 'try', 'certainly', 'held', 'attention', 'group', 'adult', 'males', 'who', 'were', 'suffering', 'serious', 'nostalgia', 'disappointment', 'seeing', 'newest', 'movie', 'one', 'relieved', 'pain.So', 'take', 'what', 'worth', 'see', 'what', 'YOU', 'think.Also', 'check', 'Transformers', 'Movie', 'Leader', 'Optimus', 'PrimeTransformers', 'Ultimate', 'Guide', 'Ultimate', 'Guide', 'Transformers', 'Transformers', 'Movie', 'Leader', 'Megatron']",N/A

In this movie, the die, and I  mean, they have huge holes in their chests and they get blown apart and one  even gets reduced to a pile of ashes (I'm sure all of you TF fans know that  one).

511785,A2DCS39GFBJV24,B00001U0DX,Kenya Starflight,"[1, 1]","If you were a child of the '80s, chances are you encountered Transformers at some point in your life.  Whether it was watching the cartoon, playing with the toys, or just seeing the commercials, they were inescapable.  But unlike some fads of the '80s, which sank without a trace, these giant robots from another planet somehow captured children's imaginations and stayed with them.  And today, after three live-action movies, nearly a dozen cartoon revivals, and countless toylines and comic spinoffs, it's quite obvious that the Autobots, Decepticons, and their war and adventures are here to stay.Before Michael Bay's explosion-fest films, however, there was another movie... a 2D animated affair that is most notable for rather brazenly killing off beloved characters.  And while it's not a masterpiece, it's a whole lot of fun, and remains a cult classic to this day.The most notable flaw of this movie, sadly, is the fact that it takes place smack in the middle of the cartoon, bridging the gap between Seasons 2 and 3.  While it does ensure that the movie doesn't contradict with the cartoon's continuity (as much continuity as the old cartoon ever had...), it does mean that a viewer who hasn't watched much of the cartoon will probably be lost as to what's going on.  Thus, it's recommended that a potential viewer be at least somewhat familiar with the characters before watching this.Set in the year 2005, the film opens with a Decepticon attack on the Autobot Base... one that leaves several beloved characters, including the legendary Optimus Prime, dead.  With his dying words, he selects the stern Ultra Magnus (voiced by Robert Stack of ""Twilight Zone"" fame) as his successor.  While the Autobots struggle to recover from the attack, a new threat rises in the form of a new Decepticon leader, Galvatron (voiced by Leonard Nimoy).  Even as they flee for their lives, the Autobots learn that the real danger isn't Galvatron, but his creator -- a godlike, world-devouring being known as Unicron (Orson Welles in his final film role).  It will take all their strength and courage -- and the bravery of a young hot-headed Autobot named Hot Rod (voiced by Judd Nelson) -- to defeat Unicron and Galvatron and ensure the safety of their homeworld.The animation in this movie isn't Disney quality, but it is a notable step up from the original cartoon, with more detail and fewer animation errors that plagued the cartoon.  The voicework is well-done, utilizing both voice actors from the original show (Peter Cullen, Frank Welker, Scatman Crothers, etc.) and new, more famous actors (Robert Stack, Judd Nelson, Leonard Nimoy, Orson Welles, Eric Idle, etc.) to great effect.  Perhaps the greatest asset of the original show was its voice actors and their talent for bringing their characters to life, and it shines through here.That and the soundtrack alone is worth giving this movie a look.  It's a boisterous combination of an excellent techno score and energetic '80s rock, with numbers by Stan Bush, Specter General, NRG, and ""Weird Al"" Yankovic.  And the classic ""Transformers"" theme song gets an exciting, pulse-pounding makeover by the band Lion, not only giving it an epic feel but adding new verses.Is this movie perfect?  Not by a long shot.  Is it as much of a classic as other '80s films like ""Empire Strikes Back"" or ""Back To the Future?""  Probably not.  But is it fun?  Heck yes.  Call it a guilty pleasure, but this movie is a ton of fun, even if a few scenes are hard to watch.  (I admit, I'm thirty and watching Optimus Prime die will still bring a tear to my eye...)  And given that this movie's purpose is to have fun (well, and sell toys), I'd say it did it's job very well.This 2-disc anniversary edition of the film contains a wide range of special features, including audio commentaries, interviews, deleted footage, storyboards, some of the original TV commercials, and an episode of the original show that was previously only aired in Japan, ""Scramble City.""  If you're a Transformers fan or even if you just love '80s movies, this is a must-own for your collection.

511786,A26G35WR7QCFR2,B00001U0DX,Kevbo,"[3, 4]","There is one big difference in watching this movie in 2007 and watching it in 1986 - now it's your money you are spending and not your parents.I was born in 1977, so I remember just being old enough (9 years old) to sit with just my little 7 year-old brother beside me when this movie rocked us.  Sure, I had watched as many episodes as possible on Saturdays (I likely saw them all), but this movie offered new venues for the classic and new characters of Transformers.What is interesting is that I saw this movie only one time - back in the summer of 1986 with my kid brother.  When I saw it available on DVD recently, I only remembered a couple things.  (1) That there were two cuss words in the script (plus ""hell"" in one of the songs), and (2) the story was epic.  Funny what you remember, no?  I also remember that I was a little prude back then, so I was quite disgruntled to hear that sour language, let alone to actually watch Transformers die!  I didn't think it was possible, especially not seeing any cartoon character die, even G.I. Joe and his adversaries.  Everybody just had bad aim back in the 80s... until this movie came out.  All of a sudden, cartoons are dying.  (Robots, even!)I just received my DVDs today.  Of course, I just got done watching the movie right now.  (Couldn't wait.)  Here is what I have to say about this DVD set.First off, the movie rocked me right here, right now.  Sure, I forgot lots of details as I only saw this movie once before, but this tale is gripping!  I also wanted to get out my Aqua Net hairspray and headbang to the soundtrack.  Dude, this piece is so awesome.  They say that they re-did the animation and coloring, but I didn't give a hoot.  I just sat there rockin' out, man.  Every shot, every line, every friggin' toy I wish my parents had the money to buy me... everything was there.Of course, I am 30 now, and now I got money.  Problem: Mom tossed my two Transformers some time during the late 80s, and those ""friends"" I had (the ones with the Transformers I didn't have) are long gone.  I am contemplating dropping green to get these toys, or maybe just start getting DVDs in rabid fashion.So let me just wrap up this ""review.""  BUY THE DAMN DVD. I don't care how old you are; I don't care if you think glam rock is for nancy boys - BUY THE DAMN DVD.  It is SO much better than what crap they've had on TV since then.  (Power Rangers?  Eat my shorts, pansies.)  You will love the storyline; you will love the action; you will dig the animation as it feels like you are living a comic book; and you will headbang once or twice.  If you ever loved toys, and if you are male (let's face it, ladies, My Little Pony, Care Bears, Cabbage Patch Kids, She-Ra, and Gem  are your babies) you will watch this and go, ""Why don't they make movies like this anymore...?  Why don't they rock like this anymore...?  Why is everything so darn sissy anymore...?  Bring back Reagan!  Bring back the 80s!  Bring back THE TRANSFORMERS!""$16 is worth it my friends, but only because you get added features galore.  They have nerd commentaries, and you know those are the best.  They also have ""Easter eggs"" (special surprises) that show the very toy commercials that had us waking our parents up on Saturdays - ""Mom... Dad... Can you buy me Transformers today?""  The commentaries, the special features, and that blasted, rockin' flick are so worth $16.  Do it, man.Alright... I gotta sleep now.  My dreams already have a theme song to rock to.  Buy it.

Nenstiel ""omnivore""","[1, 7]","Remember when we were kids and this was new and it was the coolest thing to hit the big screen and it was so awesome and you could just watch it over and over again for days?  Me neither.  I don't know whether I'm older and more sophisticated, or if CGI has jaded me on eight-cell animation, or if I was blinded by the awesomeness of the Transformers when I was a kid, but this is difficult to watch now.The animation, done at eight cells per second to cut costs, is herky-jerky and inconsistent.  The problems with the visuals are amplified by the problems with the sound, which is flat and full of metallic screeches.  The story proceeds hastily and with little explanation of its deviations from the TV series, as characters who have taken a massive pounding for years suddenly can't handle one sock in the gut.It's interesting how many stars contributed voice work to this movie.  Casey Kasem, Eric Idle, and Judd Nelson must be proud of their contributions.  Leonard Nimoy and Robert Stack, both semi-retired at this point, contribute significant characters, and this was the last work for both Scatman Crothers and Orson Welles, the latter of whom reputedly expressed shame to realize this would be his swan song.There may be a great deal of nostalgia value to this movie for people who, like me, grew up on the Transformers.  But I can't bring myself to watch it more than once.  The Transformers may have been a pocket full of awesome when I was a kid, but I'm not a kid anymore, and neither are you.

511788,A3WIOO9L0DNGZ,B00001U0DX,Kevin Major,"[0, 0]","Let me preface my review by stating that The Transformers were more or less my religion while growing up.  I had the toys, I watched the cartoon.  Heck, I even had Transformers underwear.  And to this day I can still tell the difference between Sideswipe and Sunstreaker.As others have said, Transformers: The Movie takes place between the second and third season of the cartoon show.  It takes place, ironically, in 2005, twenty years after the show originally aired.  The Autobots are winning the war, having secured Earth and Cybertron's two moons.  The Decepticons decide to launch one final all-out attack on Metroplex, the Autobot city.  In the course of battle, many Autobot favorites, including Windcharger, Wheeljack, Prowl, and Ironhide are killed.  Both Megatron and Optimus Prime are mortally wounded.In the aftermath of the attack, the Decepticons flee to Cybertron, having been defeated.  Starscream abandons Megatron and the other wounded Decepticons in space.  They are found by Unicron, a robotic planet which, uh, eats other planets.  He transforms the Decepticons into more powerful beings, most notably turning Megatron into Galvatron.  On Earth, Optimus Prime dies, and entrusts his magical Matrix to Ultra Magnus.  The Autobots learn that Unicron is devouring Cybertron's moons and will shortly devour the entire galaxy.The rest of the movie more or less plods along with the Autobots successfully defeating Unicron.  Galvatron, of course, survives to terrorize the Autobots in the future.  The Autobots' Hot Rod, a new character introduced in the movie, is transformed and becomes Rodimus Prime, their new leader.  Everything else remains rather status quo as the war between Autobots and Decepticons rages on, only with new faces in the forefront.  That being said, the movie is decidedly uneven in terms of mood.On the one hand, the movie has a lot of violence and death in it.  Many of the more popular characters are slain within the first 15-20 minutes of the film, and all die in rather violent ways.  Galvatron, played with viscious zeal by Leonard Nimoy, is a ruthless villain.  During the climactic battle, he even says something along the lines of (I'm paraphrasing): ""It's a shame you Autobots die so easily.  I'll kill you slowly so I can have some satisfaction.""  He's out for blood (or motor oil).On the other hand, there are several 'kids only' facets to the film.  Daniel, the new human character, is a child around the same age as The Transformers' target audience.  In the course of the movie, he gets to wear a mechanical suit which allows him to transform.  Blur (an Autobot who talks very fast and seems to suffer from ADD), Wheelie (a literal child Autobot who speaks in rhyme), and the Junkions (Transformers from a junk planet who speak in television cliches) are utterly useless except for appealing to kids.  Finally, Hot Rod, the movie's hero, is the prototypical 1980's sixteen year old.  As a result of these character choices, the rather adult-oriented plot suffers from these attempts to lighten the mood because they are incredibly obvious and distract from the movie's flow.The animation is very good, and still holds up today, even if it's a bit dated (the mecha designs and human fashion style scream 1980's).  Everything is fluid and the action sequences are a joy to watch.Aurally, the movie is a mixed bag.  It features some stomach-turning music by the band Kick Axe (no, I'm not kidding about their name).  They perform the worst cliche 80's hair metal (""You've got the touch!

It starts strong, but it slowly goes downhill as the plot  progresses, and by the last 20 minutes, it looked like they really rushed  the ending...but I will give it this: There has yet to be a popular ACTION  cartoon, theatrical or not, to ever come close to topping  &quot;Transformers: the Movie&quot;. This is a fact. With an all-star cast,  (and being the great Orson Welles' last movie) &quot;Transformers: the  Movie&quot; is already a classic. I see Autobot/Decepticon insignias on  cars EVERYWHERE out here in California. This movie is a bestseller on  Amazon.com! I knew I wasn't the only one crazy about &quot;Transformers:  The Movie&quot;...Till all are one.P.S. There seems to be a correlation  between those who liked &quot;Voltron&quot;, &quot;G.I. Joe&quot;,  &quot;Robotech&quot; or &quot;Thundercats&quot; and a love for the  &quot;Transformers&quot;. These were the great cartoons of the 1980s. If  for some strange reason you're familiar with the aforementioned cartoons  and not with the &quot;Transformers&quot;, I can guarantee that this movie  will not be a dissapointment. As a single film by itself,  &quot;Transformers: The Movie&quot; stands out way above the rest.  &quot;Robotech&quot; may be my favorite overall, but mark my words, there  has yet to be a popular ACTION cartoon to top 'Transformers: The  Movie'...trust me.Oh, and &quot;Transformers: The Movie&quot; is an  'Anime' title...personally, I find Anime (japanese animation) to the best  kind of animation for action cartoons. Stop reading and just get yourself a  copy before it goes out of print again!You may want to check out  &quot;Macross 1984: Do You Remember Love?&quot; - my other fave.

However, upon my arrival  in New York, I discovered this film when I rented it on video and became  fascinated. Based on the toy line and cartoon series, this film uses dark  animation and realism to illustrate the ultimate battle beween Autobots and  Decepticons. With a menancing planet approaching (Unicron), the Autobots  flee Earth and find themselves seperated in two parts of the galaxy. Hot  Rod, Kup and the Dinobots find themselves on the planet of their creators,  the Quintesons, and Arcee, Blurr, Ultra Magnus, Springer, Spike and his son  find themselves on the Planet of Junk. The animation is fantastic and the  soundtrack is pure heavy metal (appropriately for a film about  &quot;heavy&quot; robots) I got great news for all you Transformers fans.  After contacting Rhino, the DVD version will be released in October in its  UNEDITED glory. The DVD will be in an anamorphic widescreen and will  include bonuses such as the trailer.

511794,A2O0CFU9Q9XK3,B00001U0DX,"""madnessmark""","[2, 2]","Transformers The Movie had a lot of competion in the dawn of animated TV-to-movie era. It was in competition with the GI Joe Movie and the Robotech Movie. But out of all of them, Transformers was the only one that stood the test of time.The movie begins in the year 2005 when Cybertron has been taken over by the Decepticons. While Ironhide makes a special shuttle run to Autobot City on Earth, the shuttle is hijacked by Megatron and the other Decepticons. Once hearing of this, Optimus Prime rushes to earth to assist the other Autobots in combat. However, Optimus bites the big one as well as Megatron once Starscream throws him out into space. Soon, Megatron meets the gigantic Unicron and is offered a second chance to destory the matrix.Many fans of Transformers were a bit angry at the fact that so many characters were killed off in the movie. The reason for that was because they saw that in GI Joe, Duke dies, but it was edited out. The writers thought that would be cool and have a greater impact so they went overboard with it. There were too many characters to begin with anyway.This version is the special so called ""PG"" version that was originally released in theaters. I call it the PG version because once it was discovered that Danny's father says the S word in the PG version, they released an unrated edited version that includes a Star-Wars-esque opening. I like this version way better than that of the edited version that was released by FHE. The all-star voice cast includes a range of great celebrities. You may remember Peter Cullens (Optimus Prime) as the announcer for Toonami trailers. Some more famous names are Lenord Nemoy, Robert Stack (Unsolved Mysteries), Scatman Crothers (Roots), Orson Welles (his last film I should mention) and Eric Idle (Monty Python) although you can bearly understand a word he is saying since his voice is distorted in the film.Extras on here are pretty slim, but good extras at that. The first is an interview with Vince DiCola, the composer for Transformers. It's pretty long and mentions a lot of stuff about going through the process of composing music for Transformers. The second extra is a bunch of unused storyboards. These were fun to look at especially since there are descriptions on each storyboard. I would have liked it better if Rhino had included all the Transformers movie trailers.Overall, this is the best version of Transformers The Movie that easily overpowers the Laser Discs.

I heard that movie ticket sales weren't good at the time, but it seems to now be popular due to 80's nostalgia.As stated, the presentation is very well done.  Great animation (That first panning shot of Unicron is top-rate Anime quality), great voices, lots of action, and even a cool soundtrack to boot.  Some of the fight scenes (like ones in Autobot city) were superb, but I have one major gripe:Optimus Prime dies yet Megatron (turned into Galvatron) lives?!  This did not make trans fans happy (and partly explains why the movie didn't sell well upon release).  Ultra Magnus was pretty cool, but when I found out Hot Rod (later Rodimus Prime) became leader, it just made me think, &quot;This sucks, no more Optimus.&quot;  It's replaced by this lame guy who doesn't fight much, doesn't project himself like one of authority, and shorts himself out just so he can have a pow-wow with the Matrix.

Overall the details of this movie, with a darker theme to it and a heavy metal music sound, make this a very excellent movie to watch.

The story definitely had a utter shock for all fans when it was released in 1986.  Some fans didn't like back then, but you'll have to look at the special features to see why they (the movie's crew....and even Hasbro) did that.It stars a cavalcade of 1980's voice acting superstars, such as Peter Cullen (Optimus Prime and Ironhide), Frank Welker (Megatron, various other Transformers), Dan Galvezan (Bumblebee) and Susan Blu (Arcee).  It also features guest stars Judd Nelson (The Breakfast Club), Leonard Nimoy (Star Trek), the late actors Robert Stack (Unsolved Mysteries), Lionel Stander (Hart to Hart), Scatman Crothers (Hong Kong Fooey) and Orson Wells (Citizen Kane).It also has a ton of special features goodies for any TF:TM fan:-Widescreen and full screen presentations on 2 discs-Digitally color corrected and remastered-Dolby 5.1 Surround Sound-Interviews with director Nelson Shin, producers Jay Bacal and Tom Griffin, story consultant/writer Flint Dille and voice actress/director Susan Blu (who provides the voice of Arcee)-Original ""Scramble City"" episode that premiered in Japan (now with fan commentary)-Promo and theatrical teasers and trailers-TV and contest spots-Transformers toy commercials from the U.S. and Japan-Credit screen tests-Storyboard/script comparisons-Photo galleries-Transformers Trivia FanFacts (displayed through the movie)-DVD-ROM movie content-*Hidden Easter eggs on both discsThe only thing extra that they could've put on this was the interview with the film's composer, Vince DiCola.  It was included when Rhino Home Video released it first on DVD.  I guess that was the only thing that Sony BMG had missed the mark on, but other than that, overall satisfaction!A definite must for your DVD library, especially those of us who are die-hard Transformers fan from day one.

511806,A2ASEBCEN9ZWTZ,B00001U0DX,"Mr. JKW ""jkw""","[2, 2]","A mainstay of children's cartoons from the 80's, I bought this DVD in my attempts to ""relive"" my childhood.  Personally, I feel this DVD is a good buy for anyone out there who was ever a Transformers fan, or in fact ANY fan of great animation.  Like the box says, it's a ""Collector's Edition.""The movie itself was okay.  For the uninitiated, here's a rundown:Plot synopses:  The Autobots (good guy robots) battle the (evil bad guy robot) Decepticons (as usual).  The plot twist, a new menace, the planet eating Unicron, makes his way into the galaxy chomping away on things.  After a great battle between the Autobots and Decepticons, Unicron forms his army from a portion of the defeated Decepticons and wrecks havoc through them on the Autobots.  The mission - destroy the Autobot matrix of leadership.The movie marked a bridge in Transformers storylines.  It marked the end of the ""Optimus Prime, Earth based Transformers"" era.  Most of the characters from the early episodes were ""written out"" in the movie.  The movie introduced the new ""Outer space, futuristic"" era of Transformers with the introduction of new characters.  Plus, we finally see Spike become a man and have his own son Daniel.Movie features:  A rock soundtrack still kicks, animation and fight scenes that still rule even by today's standards.  All-star cast of voices:  Orson Welles, Leonard ""Mr. Spock"" Nimoy, Robert ""Unsolved Mysteries"" Stack, ""Top 40"" Casey Kasem, etc.DVD features:  Interview with musical score composer Vince DiCola and production Storyboards from the movie.Here's my rundown:Good:  The movie itself.  It's piece of Transformer history.  Solid action, kicking music. They sure don't make things like this anymore!!! The pure nostalgia makes it worthwhile for me.So-so:  The DVD extras.  The interview with the musical scorist was a ""whatever"" for me.  The production storyboards were also a ""whatever"" for me.  If you're getting it for the DVD features it's probably not worth it.Bad:  A large portion of the Transformers from the earlier episodes weren't in the movie.For me personally, this movie, in fact the whole Transformer franchise, has stood the test of time.  It was something ahead of its time.  Transforming robots that turned into cars, planes, etc.  I would put it up against anything out there today like Pokemon, Digimon, Power Rangers, etc and I think it holds it's own well.  Great for any Transformers fans out there.  Great for any kids of this generation that didn't grow up with Transformers.  Great for any action cartoon lovers.Recommended viewing for all.

The movie's greatest strengths are that the animation is above and beyond any other Transformers animation before or since.  The soundtrack (""You got the touch, you got the power!"") is absolutely awesome for the time, and the character development is surprisingly strong for an animated film about robots that turn into vehicles, guns, etc...I remember being heart-broken as a little kid watching Optimus Prime die, and that remains my biggest problem with this movie and with Transformers in general.  For whatever unknown stupid reason, the creators decided it would be great to have a new ""Prime"" so they killed off Optimus and turned Hot Rod into Rodimus Prime in the movie.  With the beginning of Season 3, Rodimus Prime was the leader of the Autobots while Galvatron was the leader of basically the Decepticons since Megatron was also given the boot.  In my opinion, creators should never ever ever kill off or destroy the main characters of children's television shows.  The kids do not understand the ""dramatic effect"" of killing off the two most popular Transformers, and 20 years later they still won't understand it (take me for instance).With the exception of those deaths this is a great movie that is a whole lot of fun.

Throughout many of the action  sequences the music is overpowering instead of flowing with the action  scenes.  Its actually annoying.  Its fill in music that should have been  replaced with background music as it was done in the TV Series on which  this movie is based.  My only other problem was some missing characters  that I would have like to see such as the Aerialbots, the Protectobots, the  Combaticons, and The Stunticons.Ok...that was the bad...Now the  Good.The animation is first class, it rivals Japanese Anime...yes it is  that good.  The story is very good.  It contains a ton of action, and some  drama but doesnt slow down once during its 90 minutes.You will see the  demise of some of your favorite Autobot/ Decepticon characters, but you  will have to watch and see which ones.  There are big name actors doing  voices for many of the characters.  New enemies are introduced (if you  thought Megatron was bad, you haven't seen anything yet! ) which play a  hand in the future episodes of the series.If you plan to buy any of the  volumes or 3 episode sets that are currently on sale, you need to buy this  first.

511823,A2TX79GR278JMA,B00001U0DX,P. Opus,"[3, 3]","There are some bits of pop culture that end up occupying a far more important place in a person's life than they possibly should because of the time and place of their arrival.  Such is the case with the 1986 Transformers movie, which appeared on the big screen when I was about nine years old and at the peak of my obsession with the war between Autobots and Decepticons.  I remember well receiving my first Transformer toy (well, actually it was a Go-Bot, the Transformers' less popular cousins) from my dad in about 1984 when he returned from a business trip to Europe.  I was hooked from then on and shortly before every birthday or holiday I would beg my parents for a few.  I watched the TV show religiously from 1984 onwards, and was enamored with the heroic and wise Optimus Prime and his band of soldiers who spent every afternoon from about 3:00 until roughly 3:30 (with commercial interruption of course) defending the world from the increasingly zany plots of Megatron and his bumbling yet commitedly (or commitably?) evil Decepticon forces.So of course I begged my mother to take me to see this movie, and arrived at the theater expecting to see the usual fare only on the big screen.  What I saw was far different and drastically more traumatizing to my young mind.  Within roughly the first fifteen minutes of the film, many of my favorite characters were unceremoniously gunned down by Megatron and his somehow-suddenly-much-more-powerful-then-ever-before Deceptions.  A few of them even had quasi-gruesome deaths, if a robot can have such a thing, exploding in flames from within their metal ""guts."" But nothing could prepare me from what was next.  Optimus Prime, the reliable and strong Autobot Leader, was killed off by Megatron.  Yes at least he put up an epic fight, but the effect was no less devastating for me.  Optimus was more than just a cartoon robot for me, he represented a certain constancy and depth of wisdom and good which I KNEW had to always prevail.  And there he was, not just dead but decaying and gray.  I sat there aghast and then asked my mom if we could leave the theater.  We walked out right as Unicron began attacking Cybertron's moons.This moment was notable as the first act of cultural criticism in my young life.  I decided that I didn't want to waste my time as well as my allowance money and voted with my feet.  I have since used that technique more than once on the same principle.None of this stopped me from watching Season 3 of the Transformers TV show, where the Decepticons returned to their bumbling ways and nobody (major) except for Optimus Prime (for the second time, in an episode called Dark Awakening) died.  However, I didn't fully understand who Rodimus Prime was and how he got there, so I began to wish I had sat through the movie just for some context.I saw the movie in full soon thereafter (I think it was actually on TV, aired in pieces) and by that I time had seen the Return of Optimus Prime episode which concluded Transformers Season 3 so I took comfort in the ""fact"" that Optimus never ""really"" died.  By this time I was probably ten and with the life wisdom I had gained in my one additional year I wasn't quite so sensitized to all the character deaths.  What I saw was a fun, very Star Wars-derivative romp through an animated galaxy where our heroes faced danger at every turn.  The Quintessons made for interesting villains (especially given the knowledge that they had created the Transformers in the first place; the back story was provided in Season 3 of the animated series) and the sheer giant scale of Unicron was, well, freakin awesome.  I saw the movie a few times after that and then soon thereafter became a teenager who was supposed to think toy robots were childish and therefore forgot all about this experience.Or did I?  As an adult, I found myself remembering this movie when the live-action Transformers films were released and wondered whether this bit of 80s nostalgia had any value.  At first I watched it online (it can be found for free there) and then subsequently bought the DVD to see it on a larger screen.  I can honestly say that watching this movie was a lot more fun and exciting than I had expected.  The animation isn't so bad and the characters are actually pretty well written.  The settings are pretty cool too (planet Junk being my favorite) and the plot has plenty of weird and unexpected twists and turns.  For a 2-hour-long toy commercial this movie is pretty good.  I also enjoyed the commentary provided by the film's creators in the bonus material.  They obviously did not know the impact that killing off Optimus Prime would have on youngsters, and it was amusing to learn that I was hardly alone in my extreme reaction to the film the first time I saw it.  I felt like I had unwittingly been a part of a larger cultural experience shared by many, which is what happens when a piece of pop culture has a wider impact than anyone had expected.Now for the four stars - no this isn't a great cinematic triumph.  But for what it is, taken as both an animated space adventure and a cultural landmark for those who came of age in the 1980s, it's well worth a few viewings.  I'm not sure that it would have the same impact if seen by subsequent generations (given some of the video game content I've witnessed, the violence here is hardly on the extreme side for them), but for us 80s children, especially those who are feeling nostalgic, this DVD set is a worthy purchase (when it is available again, that is).",4,Chicken soup for the inner child's soul,1307664000,"06 10,

Non-stop all out from the moment you hit the  play button, a dark rollercoaster ride of guns, violence, shocks and tears.  A kids movie?The highlight is the stunning battle sequence which opens  the movie. Childhood memories literally engraved on my mind were relived as  heroes fall in battle, quite shocking now nevermind when I was 6. The movie  is fantastically paced, its very fast and the soundtrack (a jolly rock  based affair mainly from Stan Bush) will have your adrenalin in overdrive.  It is brutal battle sequences which make this movie more than just a childs  film, the same being true of cartoon films like Watership Down. Then the  chaos pauses as Optimus Prime announces &quot;Megatron must be stopped...  no matter the cost.&quot; As he slowly transforms the inevitable dawns on  you and tears may fall.The actual storyline is highlighted by the awsome  menace that is Unicron, and he's actually quite haunting and mysterious -  certainly not a baddy to laugh at.

511833,A2QAUMR0V33GC9,B00001U0DX,"Scot Carr ""Film and book phanatic""","[2, 3]","I remember the '80s.  In fact, I was a high school/college geek during that time (before ""geekdom"" was actually cool) who still watched afternoon/Saturday morning cartoons.  Apart from the exceptions (all Japanese imports), most of them were basically extended commercials for what was being offered as toylines to kids.  There were two series that were different - both were selling toylines, true, but both had excellent storytelling, interesting graphics, and excellent overseas production houses that kept the quality of animation just a little bit ahead of its competitors.  They were also properties owned by Hasbro and licensed by Marvel Entertainment.  These were ""Transformers"" and ""G.I. Joe; A Real American Hero.""When The ""Transformers"" series (both TV and toyline) needed a reboot, they took an unusual approach.  Rather than doing another ""miniseries""/extended pilot to introduce new characters, Hasbro/Marvel/Sunbow Productions (the animation house responsible for most of the Marvel Entertainment series during that time) took the unusual step in spending a vast amount of money on a theatrical release.  Not just another theatrical release either - a bold, mature, sensible retelling of the Autobot saga that, rather than sticking with the tried and true simple adventure story, made the decision to massacre a lot of characters in order to make room for the new.  The even killed off the most popular character of the franchise, Optimus Prime, thus adding an emotional punch that couldn't be avoided.Yes, there were commercial reasons for doing all this, but the characters were so well established, and the script dealing with them so well-constructed as to make you care for a bunch of, let's face it, machines, the effect was to cause mass hysteria in the theaters by the younger audience members.  Parents who were expecting merely another, longer, Saturday morning diversion, were horrified.  All hands responsible got more publicity, good and bad, than they ever anticipated.  Finally, and more importantly, the Transformers were cemented in popular cuture lore fully and finally, even with their non-target audience (older guys like me who were the rarity in the cinema).What can there be said for this movie that hasn't already been?  As I mentioned, the producers spent a great deal of money to make it a quality film.  They brought in a real film scorer, the excellent Vince DeCoia (sp?) of ""Rocky IV"" fame, to do the incidental music. They built an iconic '80s soundtrack to go with it (Stan Bush?  a guilty pleasure form the big-haired decade).  They even gathered an eclectic selection of top-line stars to do voicework (yeah, they exploited the dying Orsen Welles, even ditching most of the work when it didn't cut the mustard, but they got Leonard Nimoy - Spock, the ultimate scifi good guy - to play the revived villain Galvatron).  The result?  Something that had an epic feel all over it, what with all the death, wandering around from mission to mission and such, a unique achievement in a bloated field.An epic with a decidedly mature feel as well.  I've read some of the previous reviews, and understand that, as like then, some parents ignored the justified PG rating and got this for their young kids, expecting a merely ""kids"" cartoon.  Therefore I must add this to what I wrote - THIS IS NOT FOR YOUNG OR EASY UPSET CHILDREN!  As mentioned earlier, characters die - shockingly, brutally, and in rather large numbers.

511834,A3EOHYIHQM3KK,B00001U0DX,Sean Ares Hirsch,"[0, 2]","There are some things to be said for this movie. The action is there and suspense is well placed at times. Some characters like Optimous Prime, Ultra Magness, Galvatron, and Unicron are well drawn and memorable. On it's own, it is a fairly good movie. But in all honesty, this is very shallow compared to several animated movies I have seen. &quot;Scooby Doo On Zombie Island&quot; actually had a better story line; this movie actually frightened me more; character development was stronger; the story started normal and gradually unfolded into terror; and surprise events were VERY WELL placed. The Voltron series also carried more weight. We had 5 heroes with distinct personalities; and the villains King Zarkon, Hagar the witch, and Prince Lotour carried a very frightening and chilling essence. But at times they were even likable! The animated Batman series not only tried to stay within certain boundaries of plausibility, but they also worked greatly on character development. And often, we could be in two minds as to whether we should oppose the villains or feel sorry for them. I did like the Transformers at one time. But they lack either the charm and organization of the Scooby Doo Movies, the creepy charm of the Voltron (Lion) Movies, or the superb character development of the early 90s Batman Series. This movie seems to suffer from some of Disney's traits. (A simple good guy versus bad guy plot, no gray areas, low humor, ('Me Grimlock kick butt'), and amongst other things an artificial simplistic happy ending. Couldn't the autobots have said one nice thing about their deceased noble leader Optimous Prime in the end? How about poor Prowl, Iron Hide, and Ratchet?

But it's a must for animation fans in general and practically a Bible for fans of TFs in specific.There are enough reviews about the movie itself here, so I'll just say a few words about the DVD. The storyboards of un-animated scenes and interview with Vince DiCola are both fun, but they weren't all the DVD could have included. TF:TM is a five-star movie, but the DVD only scores a 3 at most.Being an animated feature, there wouldn't be any outtakes or deleted scenes anyway, so that's fine. But no trailer? I'd have killed for a trailer! I'd still kill for a trailer! Or maybe some toy commercials from the 80's featuring the movie action figures, like the GI Joe DVD. Or, like the Dragonball DVDs, I'd have liked a mini-featurette about how the Transformers got to the point where they were at when the movie began, or where they went afterwards. Wouldn't those have been cool? Plus, it would have been a kick to see the scrolling prologue and epilogue which were in the UK version of the movie. And what's with the full-screen [stuff]? This movie was in theaters, y'know! Where's my widescreen option???Still, no point in complaining now. TF:TM was, unfortunately, a box-office flop, so we're lucky we got this.

This whole concept of a vehicle that could transform into a humanoid form, wich not only had a deep character but also a form of spirituality, is very mind stimulating.Transformers The Movie is a modern myth, like Star Wars, only Star Wars is very limited in comparison to the Transformers. Like all good myths this movie has certain universal themes, the latter I shall describe below:- The battle between good and evil (Autobots vs Decepticons)- That wich transcends and unites good and evil (the infinte danger of Unicron that would wipe out all existence).- A secret power from within, a spiritual essence (the Autobotmatrix).- The transcendence of the hero (HotRod becoming Rhodimus Prime).- The transcendence of the villain (Megatron becoming Galvatron).- The exploration of an unknown realm (Cup and HotRod visiting Quintessa).- The victory over the subconciouss mind (when Cup and HotRod are thrown into the Sharkticon pool they even go deeper, and drive in circles, thus creating a vortex wich throws the water out giving them free game to battle the Sharkticons).- True comradry and friendship (well, this is just all over the movie).- The rise and fall of pride (Starscream's coronation).These are just a few wich are displayed but I think you have to watch the movie and decide for yourself. I rate this movie five stars because it is such a wonderfull myth (but a myth wich is greatly animated and highly entertaining and has fantastic music).

511842,A1TR9417Z4U72F,B00001U0DX,"S. M. Robare ""smurfwreck""","[1, 1]","Transformers: the Movie was one of two animated feature films that were released in 1986 by DEG/Marvel/Sunbow entertainment, the other being G.I. Joe: the Movie.  Both films had very similar plots (both written by Ron Friedman a series writer for the G.I. Joe cartoon), both served as a re-launch of the cartoon franchises, and both featured controversial major character death scenes that caused a minor blip on the radar of concerned parents everywhere.  They also both featured a fair amount of big named actors doing voice-work (Transformers has Judd Nelson, Eric Idle, Robert Stack, Leonard Nimoy, and freaking Orson Welles, whereas G.I. Joe has Don Johnson and Sgt. Slaughter.)  What sets Transformers apart is that it was released first which meant that it actually got into theatres un-edited whereas G.I. Joe didn't fare so well (it was rushed to TV instead as a five part mini series with a new ending to 'fix' the original character death scene.)I have to say, outside of not including the original cover art that I am pretty partial too, this is the best this film has ever looked (will probably ever look) and it's accompanied by the best set of extras that pretty much anyone could hope for.  The cover art isn't all that bad.  There are two separate covers for the flick that are printed on both sides of the insert so you can choose the version that you like the best, either with the original generation 1 characters or with the newer revamp characters that are introduced in the movie. When you consider that the original cover featured Ultra Magnus, it sort of makes a nice triptych of images with all the Autobot leaders featured.  The DVD was also packaged with a special lenticular insert that lets you flip between the two images and is very reminiscent of the old Transformers sticker books.  The other thing that I really like about the DVD is the artwork on the discs themselves and granted it's a bit superficial, but it does illustrate that whoever worked on the packaging had the fans at heart.  The discs creatively display both Unicron and the Matrix, utilizing the hole in the center of the disc.Anyway, the actual film has been cleaned-up and the brightness of the color in the animation restored for the first time since it was theatrically released.  Sony has also provided two versions of the film, both widescreen and full screen, which for this film is particularly important as the widescreen version (that was seen in theatres) is actually a cropped version of the film to attain the widescreen ratio.  The full screen version that has been previously released on home video actually has the complete image that was intended for view by the animators (there is a version of the film floating around that was restored from either a test copy of the film or the original animation that has an even larger visible image area, but it's all page runoff stuff that was never intended for view.)  So for the first time in 20 years the film can be watched either as it was intended or as it was shown in theatres, which is pretty cool.The DVD also features commentary by Nelson Shin, the director (which I haven't listened to yet, but could be interesting or it could be worse than Warwick Davis' commentary on Willow), as well as both a fan commentary and a 'pop-up video-esque' trivia feature, that probably has nothing new as far as info for hardcore fans, but is fun to have none the less.  There's also a slew of promo material like trailers, TV spots, animatics, and test footage as well as a few toy commercials from both the US and Japan.  There's also an episode from a Japan only Transformers spin-off, Scramble City with optional commentary.Pretty much this DVD set has everything (outside of the music videos for a couple of the songs in the film) that a Transformers fan could every want out of a DVD release.",5,I would have waited an eternity for this DVD...,1245369600,"06 19, 2009",2009,3854,"['Transformers', 'Movie', 'was', 'one', 'two', 'animated', 'feature', 'films', 'were', 'released', '1986', 'DEG/Marvel/Sunbow', 'entertainment', 'other', 'being', 'G.I', 'Joe', 'Movie', 'Both', 'films', 'had', 'very', 'similar', 'plots', 'written', 'Ron', 'Friedman', 'series', 'writer', 'G.I', 'Joe', 'cartoon', 'served', 're-launch', 'cartoon', 'franchises', 'featured', 'controversial', 'major', 'character', 'death', 'scenes', 'caused', 'minor', 'blip', 'radar', 'concerned', 'parents', 'everywhere', 'also', 'featured', 'fair', 'amount', 'big', 'named', 'actors', 'doing', 'voice-work', 'Transformers', 'Judd', 'Nelson', 'Eric', 'Idle', 'Robert', 'Stack', 'Leonard', 'Nimoy', 'freaking', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'whereas', 'G.I', 'Joe', 'Don', 'Johnson', 'Sgt', 'Slaughter', 'What', 'Transformers', 'apart', 'was', 'released', 'first', 'meant', 'actually', 'got', 'theatres', 'un-edited', 'whereas', 'G.I', 'Joe', 'did', ""n't"", 'fare', 'so', 'well', 'was', 'rushed', 'TV', 'instead', 'five', 'part', 'mini', 'series', 'new', 'ending', ""'fix"", 'original', 'character', 'death', 'scene', 'have', 'say', 'not', 'including', 'original', 'cover', 'art', 'am', 'pretty', 'partial', 'too', 'best', 'film', 'ever', 'looked', 'will', 'probably', 'ever', 'look', 'accompanied', 'best', 'set', 'extras', 'pretty', 'much', 'anyone', 'could', 'hope', 'cover', 'art', ""n't"", 'bad', 'are', 'two', 'separate', 'covers', 'flick', 'are', 'printed', 'sides', 'insert', 'can', 'choose', 'version', 'best', 'either', 'original', 'generation', '1', 'characters', 'newer', 'revamp', 'characters', 'are', 'introduced', 'movie', 'When', 'consider', 'original', 'cover', 'featured', 'Ultra', 'Magnus', 'sort', 'nice', 'triptych', 'images', 'Autobot', 'leaders', 'featured', 'DVD', 'was', 'also', 'packaged', 'special', 'lenticular', 'insert', 'flip', 'two', 'images', 'very', 'reminiscent', 'old', 'Transformers', 'sticker', 'books', 'other', 'thing', 'really', 'DVD', 'artwork', 'discs', 'granted', 'bit', 'superficial', 'illustrate', 'worked', 'packaging', 'had', 'fans', 'heart', 'discs', 'creatively', 'display', 'Unicron', 'Matrix', 'utilizing', 'hole', 'center', 'disc.Anyway', 'actual', 'film', 'been', 'cleaned-up', 'brightness', 'color', 'animation', 'restored', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'theatrically', 'released', 'Sony', 'also', 'provided', 'two', 'versions', 'film', 'widescreen', 'full', 'screen', 'film', 'particularly', 'important', 'widescreen', 'version', 'was', 'seen', 'theatres', 'actually', 'cropped', 'version', 'film', 'attain', 'widescreen', 'ratio', 'full', 'screen', 'version', 'been', 'previously', 'released', 'home', 'video', 'actually', 'complete', 'image', 'was', 'intended', 'view', 'animators', 'version', 'film', 'floating', 'was', 'restored', 'test', 'copy', 'film', 'original', 'animation', 'even', 'larger', 'visible', 'image', 'area', 'page', 'runoff', 'stuff', 'was', 'never', 'intended', 'view', 'So', 'first', 'time', '20', 'years', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'watched', 'either', 'was', 'intended', 'was', 'shown', 'theatres', 'pretty', 'cool.The', 'DVD', 'also', 'commentary', 'Nelson', 'Shin', 'director', 'have', ""n't"", 'listened', 'yet', 'could', 'be', 'interesting', 'could', 'be', 'worse', 'Warwick', 'Davis', 'commentary', 'Willow', 'as', 'well', 'fan', 'commentary', ""'pop-up"", 'video-esque', 'trivia', 'feature', 'probably', 'nothing', 'new', 'as', 'far', 'info', 'hardcore', 'fans', 'fun', 'have', 'none', 'less', 'also', 'slew', 'promo', 'material', 'trailers', 'TV', 'spots', 'animatics', 'test', 'footage', 'as', 'well', 'few', 'toy', 'commercials', 'US', 'Japan', 'also', 'episode', 'Japan', 'only', 'Transformers', 'spin-off', 'Scramble', 'City', 'optional', 'commentary.Pretty', 'much', 'DVD', 'set', 'everything', 'music', 'videos', 'couple', 'songs', 'film', 'Transformers', 'fan', 'could', 'want', 'DVD', 'release']",N/A

There have been 2 Care Bear movies (both good) GI Joe the movie (Ok at best) Masters of the Universe (Laughable) and all have have been basically what the cartoons were all about.  They easily could of been part of the animated series (Except Masters because it was live action).  This one however went above and beyond that.  It didn't start off like anohter episode, we went to many years later (At least from the point I remember) the war is in the favor of the Decepticons and there is much trouble a brewing.  Optimus Prime and Ultra Magnus are valiently defending the Autobots (as well as the other guys) and things are looking grim, especially since an even more dangerouse menace called Unicron is coming.  That is mearly the start.Teh animation is straight out of the series as it should be, no fancy computer effecxts (I am looking in Pokemons direction) or just a measily follow up to the series (GI Joe).What really impressed me however was not just the story, it was the new theme music that Lion gave the movie.  It's the same words but with a powerful 80's rock and roll style to it that is incredible.  Literally you must hear it to believe it.In the end however it will dwindle down through time as another leave on the shelf rental.  Why, because of one primary reason, it's age.  True this came out in the late 80's, but in the childrens section iut does it little justice.  The violence and mild profanity deem it to be at the very least in the animation section of any rental place.  That it has become a cult hit that few will pay attention to unless you were actually a fan of the series.  The new series can even begin to compare to power and coolness that this one held.  Beat Wars come on, and this new combo of the two is just as bad.Buy this if you are either a fan of the series or like a good animated movie.",5,More than meets the eye,1012953600,"02 6, 2002",2002,1888,"['Many', 'classic', 'cartoons', 'have', 'become', 'movies', 'have', 'been', '2', 'Care', 'Bear', 'movies', 'good', 'GI', 'Joe', 'movie', 'Ok', 'best', 'Masters', 'Universe', 'Laughable', 'have', 'have', 'been', 'basically', 'what', 'cartoons', 'were', 'easily', 'could', 'been', 'part', 'animated', 'series', 'Masters', 'was', 'live', 'action', 'one', 'however', 'went', 'did', ""n't"", 'start', 'off', 'anohter', 'episode', 'went', 'many', 'years', 'later', 'least', 'point', 'remember', 'war', 'favor', 'Decepticons', 'much', 'trouble', 'brewing', 'Optimus', 'Prime', 'Ultra', 'Magnus', 'are', 'valiently', 'defending', 'Autobots', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'guys', 'things', 'are', 'looking', 'grim', 'especially', 'even', 'more', 'dangerouse', 'menace', 'called', 'Unicron', 'coming', 'mearly', 'start.Teh', 'animation', 'straight', 'series', 'should', 'be', 'fancy', 'computer', 'effecxts', 'am', 'looking', 'Pokemons', 'direction', 'just', 'measily', 'follow', 'up', 'series', 'GI', 'Joe', 'really', 'impressed', 'however', 'was', 'not', 'just', 'story', 'was', 'new', 'theme', 'music', 'Lion', 'gave', 'movie', 'same', 'words', 'powerful', '80', 'rock', 'roll', 'style', 'incredible', 'Literally', 'must', 'hear', 'believe', 'end', 'however', 'will', 'dwindle', 'down', 'through', 'time', 'leave', 'shelf', 'rental', 'Why', 'one', 'primary', 'reason', 'age', 'True', 'came', 'out', 'late', '80', 'childrens', 'section', 'iut', 'little', 'justice', 'violence', 'mild', 'profanity', 'deem', 'be', 'very', 'least', 'animation', 'section', 'rental', 'place', 'become', 'cult', 'hit', 'few', 'will', 'pay', 'attention', 'were', 'actually', 'fan', 'series', 'new', 'series', 'can', 'even', 'begin', 'compare', 'power', 'coolness', 'one', 'held', 'Beat', 'Wars', 'come', 'new', 'combo', 'two', 'just', 'as', 'bad.Buy', 'are', 'either', 'fan', 'series', 'good', 'animated', 'movie']",N/A

Yeah, now that I am older I can see some flaws and cheesyness to the whole plot and things, but I still love it. I feel just like a kid again. Overall, a great piece of work at the cutting edge for it's time.  I do think they could have done more in depth documentary stuff for this set.  I know one thing missing that I thought was funny on the first DVD release was the fact that they mentioned how the movie boogie nights asked them for rights to use ""the touch"", this was not on this version.  Sony did a good job on the remaster, and I look foreward to the Cartoons remastering soon and hopefully being released some time early next year.",4,"Love the widescreen remastering, looks great, like the  triva,.",1163635200,"11 16, 2006",2006,710,"['huge', 'fan', 'transformer', 'movie', 'just', 'classic', 'Yeah', 'now', 'am', 'older', 'can', 'see', 'flaws', 'cheesyness', 'whole', 'plot', 'things', 'still', 'love', 'feel', 'just', 'kid', 'again', 'Overall', 'great', 'piece', 'work', 'cutting', 'edge', 'time', 'do', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'more', 'depth', 'documentary', 'stuff', 'set', 'know', 'one', 'thing', 'missing', 'thought', 'was', 'funny', 'first', 'DVD', 'release', 'was', 'fact', 'mentioned', 'how', 'movie', 'boogie', 'nights', 'asked', 'rights', 'use', 'touch', 'was', 'not', 'version', 'Sony', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'remaster', 'look', 'foreward', 'Cartoons', 'remastering', 'soon', 'hopefully', 'being', 'released', 'time', 'early', 'next', 'year']",N/A
