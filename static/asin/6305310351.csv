Reate is a pretty good movie but it is nowhere close to his best movies of the early 80's like Coming to America, Trading Places and Beverly Hills Cop. Eddie Murphy is doing a great job in the role but his jokes are a bit lame since one has heard them in other movies before. The music is what makes this movie less then stellar. The music is terrible to say the least. It seems to me like they went way cheap on selecting the person to write the soundtrack and many other tracks sounds like cheap 80's music produced in someone's basement. The script is alright but it just that extra fun and excitement that other Eddie Murphy movies.

Like the official critic reviews above, I beg to differ. I love low brow, I'll just get that off my chest, the only criteria a movie needs to meet in my opinion is did it do its job of entertaining me, even if production value is low and the acting was wooden but it provided hilarity then it did its job. ""The Golden Child"" isn't a second ""Citizen Kane"" nor does it try to be, if your looking for Oscar worthy script or performance, look elsewhere. This movie however is a funny, action filled, slam bam thank you mam, typical 80's fantasy where a child is born the new Dali Lama, the reincarnation of the Buddhist's equivalent of Jesus. He has come to save and heal the world, there are dark forces out to destroy him and Eddie Murphy plays the social worker who seeks to protect and deliver him to safety. I know not a original plot and yes it is kind of stupid (demon skeleton is outdated and  the director seemed to have a fascination with oatmeal and blood yuck!), but stupid can be entertaining. Especially 80's stupid which is the best.

But the only member of the cast to approach it that way was Eddie Murphy as Chandler Jarrell (finder of lost children).  Charles Dance, as the allegedly evil villain Sardo Numspa, simply looks bewildered throughout (as does much of the rest of the cast).  It is an odd movie, a fantasy of sorts.  Murphy's character is supposed to rescue a boy (played by a girl).  The kid is mystical; he can turn pop cans into tap dancing creations, when he's not resurrecting dead butterflies and the odd corpse.  The jokes are pounded into the ground without much enthusiasm.  (Apparently, the role of Chandler Jarrell was first offered to Mel Gibson!!!)  The special effects are a bit slapdash, when there are any.  There was actually a bidding war for this script.  Frank (Scooby-Doo) Welker did the voice of The Thing.  Everyone should watch this movie at least once in their life (I've lost track of the number of times I've watched it).

In this role, he has the ""onerous"" responsibility of finding the ""Golden Child"". The Golden Child is a Buddhist child with supernatural powers who was kidnapped by some evil villains and sorcerers. I first saw this film in the late 1980s and I loved it. I still enjoy watching it to this day, particularly the sarcastic humour typical of Eddie Murphy.Eddie Murphy plays the reluctant hero, having been thrust into an unnatural and supernatural world of sorcery and mysticism. The Golden child, who is one in a line of divine Lamas and upon his compassion and grace the fate of the world rests, is a delightful and charming kid. The lady who identifies Eddie Murphy as the Chosen One is cute. Charles Dance, who plays as the wicked ""Sardun Numspa"", performs his role with expertise.In this film, Eddie Murphy looks more serious than usual and the swearing and four letter words are much less. Eddie Murphy fans will enjoy his usual cute jokes. Viewers will also enjoy many visual appealing scenes.This is one of Eddie Murphy's best movies.

It is nice to be able to show our children what T.V. used to be like and why we don't like what is on T.V. now.We don't have cable any more due to all the trash on T.V. we use Netflix and stream Netflix on our Roku and Logi Revue (Google T.V.) We have a more quality life and more time on our hands since we don't channel surf. We can watch T.V. when we want to at an affordable price thanks to Netflix and our streaming devices. This is the way T.V. should be. No need for the inflation that happens every month/year.

459758,A2HVL790PBWYTU,6305310351,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 2]","Boy, this flick was a lot better when I saw it as a kid in the 1980s. Now, the material seems horribly dated and the movie, compared to today's CG technology, suffers from decidedly less than spectacular special effects (though the animated dancing Pepsi can is still cute). Also grating on the nerves now is the strident electronic chords and horns heard in the soundtrack. Not as good and diverting as BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA, THE GOLDEN CHILD, which came out in the same year (1986), shares the same Eastern mysticism, horror/fantasy elements, and tongue-in-cheek tone.Plot SPOILERS begin:In Los Angeles, fez-wearing Chandler Jarrell (Eddie Murphy), finder of lost children, is pestered by exotically beautiful Kee Nang (Charlotte Lewis) into searching for the Golden Child, a magical Buddhist boy kidnapped from Tibet who is prophesied to save the world. When a connection seemingly links the missing Golden Boy to a murdered girl Jarrell had been looking for, he reluctantly takes on Kee Nang's case. Jarrell is told that he's the Chosen One, the one destined to find the Golden Child. Over the course of the film, as inexplicable supernatural events persist in surfacing, Jarrell's initial mocking incredulity transforms into gradual belief. Witnessing freaky dreams, demons, reptilian women, and enigmatic men materializing and dematerializing into thin air will do that. Everything hinges on his unearthing the Ajanti Dagger, an otherworldy artifact capable of killing the Golden Child but capable of also turning the tide in Jarrell's favor.Given, Eddie Murphy isn't at his best here, for some reason, though his trademark bray of a laugh is ever present. Maybe because of the action-heavy, horror-oriented plot, less emphasis is placed on comedy, although this feature still offers vestiges of the funny (I know this is unPC but my favorite line in the film is Murphy's aside to the Golden Child: ""Did you have Star Search in Tibet? Probably not...you probably have Food Search.""). I recall only two instances where Eddie seriously cuts loose with his patented Axel Foley jive (in the unconvincing Kathmandu airport scene and later in the ""Brother Numsy"" routine, also in an airport). His character of Jarrell does present the familiar smirky, wisecracking persona we've all come to know and love, but he's definitely not as effectively funny here as in, say, 48 HOURS, TRADING PLACES, or BEVERLY HILLS COP. Another detriment is that the romance seems somewhat forced to me as Eddie and Charlotte Lewis display little chemistry. Too, that insipid dream segment annoyed the living crap out of me.End SPOILERS.It's hard to criticize a gorgeous woman like Charlotte Lewis but, sadly, she proves to be tepid in her performance. Fortunately, I didn't care all that much because the eye candy she embodies more than made up for her lackluster acting (Gawd, that sexy face, those enticing gams, that shot of her on the bed in that blue shirt and panties!) and her character does gain bonus points for her somersaults and her use of martial arts. Charles Dance (the contact lens-happy villain of THE LAST ACTION HERO) carries off his dastardly role of Sardo Numspa with sinister British aplomb, while young J.L. Reate is fine as the close-mouthed but cute bald child of prophecy. Ex-boxer Randall ""Tex"" Cobb has a minor role as a childlike baddie while James Hong and the terrific Victor Wong (both are in BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA) also appear.While not the most horrible movie he ever made, THE GOLDEN CHILD is still a lesser light in the Eddie Murphy oeuvre. Simply put, it just isn't as good as his more prominent films (the three mentioned above, as well as his later, more family-oriented features). Having said that, I did enjoy it as a child and it does have its merits. If you have a hankering for fantasy/horror, a touch of kung fu, a whiff of irreverent comedy, and the hot Charlottle Lewis to slobber over, well, THE GOLDEN CHILD is the dvd to pop in.

The romance that almost works, the sometimes Indiana Jones characterization, the dry humor more reminiscent of Bill Murray -- all of these things push this film into mediocrity. It might be better, but it could be a whole lot worse. It has the &quot;feel&quot; of a 1930s/40s setting, more because of the alien settings (even in modern Los Angeles) and I have to wonder if some of this film didn't steal from Carpenter's Big Trouble in Little China...While others (especially the critics) panned this one, I suspect they were looking for another fast-talking, wise-cracking performance and that just isn't to be found in this interesting film. What we have is a more subdued and serious Eddy Murphy, but not taking himself too seriously, who is caught up in a very strange situation.

459779,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,6305310351,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[18, 18]","Murphy was so popular before this flick came out, somebody wrote at the time, that he could survive if it flopped.  ""Golden Child"" was a commercial disappointment and it did hurt him.  To this day, I don't know why.Murphy is Chandler Jerroll - an LA-based PI with a flip attitude on anything.  He's a hero of the city of angels, but he's no angel himself.  In short, he is the ""chosen one"", the foretold hero destined to save the ""golden child"" from evil.  While Jerroll searches LA for lost children, the enchanted golden child rises in spiritual purity in a snowy monastery in the Himalayas.  The wicked forces of Sardo Numspar (Charles Dance) invade the monastery and, after overrunning the monks, spirit the boy away in a cage.  The boy, it turns out, is one of a line of divine lamas upon whom the world rests, and whom evil must destroy.  Dark Forces had already claimed other golden children.  With the loss of the ""bringer of justice"", the death of another golden child will plunge the world into hell.  Why Murphy is the ""Chosen One"" (and who's doing the choosing here?) are subjects the script keeps wisely away from.  Instead, what we get is a deft mix of high adventure and comedy.  It shouldn't work at all, but Murphy mugs on cue and can handle the preposterousness of the situation - a modern LA guy having to battle the forces of evil.  The joke of the flick is that Eddie Murphy is the Chosen One - only a comically refined mind could effectively mix the fun and action like he does.  Crude special effects aside, the fantasy mixes well with the comedy, and Murphy's light touch plays well off of the evil Numspar and Charlotte Lewis as Jerrol's love interest.  This is simply an underappreciated classic.",4,Great Murphy flick,1020902400,"05 9, 2002",2002,1722,"['Murphy', 'was', 'so', 'popular', 'flick', 'came', 'out', 'somebody', 'wrote', 'time', 'could', 'survive', 'flopped', 'Golden', 'Child', 'was', 'commercial', 'disappointment', 'did', 'hurt', 'day', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why.Murphy', 'Chandler', 'Jerroll', 'LA-based', 'PI', 'flip', 'attitude', 'anything', 'hero', 'city', 'angels', 'angel', 'short', 'chosen', 'one', 'foretold', 'hero', 'destined', 'save', 'golden', 'child', 'evil', 'Jerroll', 'searches', 'LA', 'lost', 'children', 'enchanted', 'golden', 'child', 'spiritual', 'purity', 'snowy', 'monastery', 'Himalayas', 'wicked', 'forces', 'Sardo', 'Numspar', 'Charles', 'Dance', 'invade', 'monastery', 'overrunning', 'monks', 'spirit', 'boy', 'away', 'cage', 'boy', 'out', 'one', 'line', 'divine', 'lamas', 'whom', 'world', 'whom', 'evil', 'must', 'destroy', 'Dark', 'Forces', 'had', 'already', 'claimed', 'other', 'golden', 'children', 'loss', 'bringer', 'justice', 'death', 'golden', 'child', 'will', 'plunge', 'world', 'hell', 'Why', 'Murphy', 'Chosen', 'One', 'who', 'doing', 'choosing', 'here', 'are', 'script', 'wisely', 'away', 'Instead', 'what', 'get', 'deft', 'mix', 'high', 'adventure', 'comedy', 'should', ""n't"", 'work', 'Murphy', 'mugs', 'cue', 'can', 'handle', 'preposterousness', 'situation', 'modern', 'LA', 'guy', 'having', 'battle', 'forces', 'evil', 'joke', 'flick', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'Chosen', 'One', 'only', 'comically', 'refined', 'mind', 'could', 'effectively', 'mix', 'fun', 'action', 'Crude', 'special', 'effects', 'aside', 'fantasy', 'mixes', 'well', 'comedy', 'Murphy', 'light', 'touch', 'plays', 'well', 'evil', 'Numspar', 'Charlotte', 'Lewis', 'Jerrol', 'love', 'interest', 'simply', 'underappreciated', 'classic']",The Golden Child
