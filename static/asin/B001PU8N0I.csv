In fact, I liked it better than the novel, which I read afterwards.  The series seemed to get at the heart of the story without all the melodramatic subplots that clutter up the novel-- which Dickens after all had to stuff in to keep his magazine serial going.  I wish I could see the Jacobi version again, but unfortunately it's not available on DVD.  So I tried this 2000s BBC one, and was appalled at the mess it makes even of Dickens's melodrama.  It crams all the subplots into an overproduced, overacted, and underwritten 8 hours or so, and the result is an incoherent embarrassment in which the heart of the story-- commerce's lethal effects on human relationships-- doesn't come out at all.  It's not even bad Dickens.  I stopped watching about two thirds of the way through.

Little Dorrit is a story of how people deal with poverty such as Amy's being born and growing up in a debtor's prison. Also, there are her father's difficulties in finding self esteem and acceptance even when he is freed from the prison and has to struggle to gain acceptance in a society in which status is considered of prime importance.  Amy's compassion for her father is shown with great sensitivity-- especially when she comforts him when he feels he is a failure because he is in prison and has lost his former life of wealth and success.  And there is that moving moment near the end of the story when Amy and Arthur Clenham realize that they have a fortune in their love relationship even though it looks as if their money is all gone. This miniseries is so good that seeing it makes you want to read the book.The only drawback with this set is the case that was provided.

But then, why am I not giving it five stars rather than giving it 4 starts? I think the problem is with the book ""Little Dorrit"" itself - as a drama it has nothing like the quality of Bleak House - the book is a book of 2 halves which fit together somewhat akwardly i.e the pre and post incarceration period for the Dorrits.No matter how good a production is, its very difficult to cure a problem which is a problem with the book itself. There are some parts of the story which are too bizarre to be beleivable - the murdering frenchman, for example, is not really believable and I felt uncomfortable with the ending (the House of Clenham angle) - obviously it was delightful that Clenham and Little Dorrit get it together. So, what I am saying is that the book has too many problems and I don't think without being unfaithful to the book, that these problems can be ironed out by any production. Thus, whilst I greeted each Bleak House episode with real interest and joy, I was happy to merely watch Little Dorrit on and off i.e. I was not driven to watching it whereas I was with Bleak House.",4,Another excellent production from the BBC/Boston,1273536000,"05 11, 2010",2010,1196,"['Bleak', 'House', 'wonderful', 'production', 'wonderful', 'acting', 'evocative', 'theme', 'music', 'then', 'why', 'am', 'not', 'giving', 'five', 'stars', 'rather', 'giving', '4', 'starts', 'think', 'problem', 'book', 'Little', 'Dorrit', 'drama', 'nothing', 'quality', 'Bleak', 'House', 'book', 'book', '2', 'halves', 'fit', 'together', 'somewhat', 'akwardly', 'pre', 'post', 'incarceration', 'period', 'Dorrits.No', 'matter', 'how', 'good', 'production', 'very', 'difficult', 'cure', 'problem', 'problem', 'book', 'are', 'parts', 'story', 'are', 'too', 'bizarre', 'be', 'beleivable', 'murdering', 'frenchman', 'example', 'not', 'really', 'believable', 'felt', 'uncomfortable', 'ending', 'House', 'Clenham', 'angle', 'obviously', 'was', 'delightful', 'Clenham', 'Little', 'Dorrit', 'get', 'together', 'So', 'what', 'am', 'saying', 'book', 'too', 'many', 'problems', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'being', 'unfaithful', 'book', 'problems', 'can', 'be', 'ironed', 'out', 'production', 'Thus', 'whilst', 'greeted', 'Bleak', 'House', 'episode', 'real', 'interest', 'joy', 'was', 'happy', 'merely', 'watch', 'Little', 'Dorrit', 'i.e', 'was', 'not', 'driven', 'watching', 'was', 'Bleak', 'House']",N/A

1229836,A3OXRFCJI67IMN,B001PU8N0I,Bold Consumer,"[1, 1]","The story, although centered on a depressing topic, is brilliantly and delightfully told, a story more about hope than despair, even though there was plenty of that around as well. It's easy to care about what happens to the characters from the beginning. Amy finds beauty in everything and everyone. Others find beauty in her in spite of the drab surroundings. As usual with a Charles Dickens novel, all is not exactly as it seems. There is much more hidden within the lives of these amazing characters. This classic novel comes to life as portrayed by these excellent actors.Amy or ""Little Dorrit"" is desperately poor, spending most of her life caring for her father who is in debtor's prison, a place we get to know well throughout the story. Amy is, in spite of her circunmstances, a lady, as her father, who has become emotionally unstable over the years in debtor's prison,  constantly reminds her. Surrounded in poverty and wearing her one old ragged dress, she speaks modestly but elegantly, as if she had received an excellent education, which she apparently did, from her father. Amy moves through her many duties with grace, and wins respect from everyone who observes her, rich or poor. Her sweet, unselfish disposition and the fact that she takes care of everyone else,  makes viewers love her as well, and want to protect her from the dangers and insults we see around her. For example, when she got locked out of the debtor's prison and had to seek refuge off a street full of ruffians on a cold staircase, Amy never uttered a complaint. She was more concerned with the welfare of her friend, who was 'slow' mentally and unable to take care of herself. She moves gracefully and purposefully, never questioning why she has been given such a tough life situation.I had heard of debtor's prisons all my life, but never had a handle on what they really were. Very interesting, and not at all what I would have thought. The atmosphere, with the streets teeming with people selling whatever they could find to sell, potatoes, violets, etc., effectively set the stage for this story. A number of intriguing characters interact in surprising ways as the complicated plot makes its twists and turns, characters interesting enough to make us care what happens to them, good and bad.Does good triumph over evil in this story? You'll have to read the novel, watch the DVD, or both, to find out.

1229840,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B001PU8N0I,Byron Kolln,"[4, 4]","Following up the BBC's epic 2005 miniseries of ""Bleak House"" comes Charles Dickens' poignant LITTLE DORRIT, the tale of a young girl born into London's most infamous debtors' prison, but whose destiny is inextricably linked to the lives and fortunes of several others.Growing up the daughter of Marshalsea Prison's most esteemed inmate Mr Dorrit (Tom Courtenay), ""Little"" Amy Dorrit (Claire Foy) is a dutiful and charming young girl, who does what she can to contribute towards the upkeep of the Dorrit family.  Following his families' unexpected fall from fortune, Dorrit has spent the entire span of Amy's life locked away in the Marshalsea, where he has become something of a London celebrity.  When Amy goes to work as a seamstress for the ageing Mrs Clennam (Judy Parfitt), nobody, lest not Amy, is prepared for the events which will unfold.Arriving back in London after spending many years in China with his ill father, Mrs Clennam's son Arthur (Matthew Macfadyen) is full of pressing questions that he desperately needs answers for, the most puzzling one being a hand-stitched note reading ""Do not forget"", hidden inside a fob-watch, given to Arthur on his father's deathbed.  When Arthur encounters Amy, he determines to unravel the legal red-tape around the Dorrit's fortune at the Circumlocution Office.  Despite Arthur's best intentions, there are sinister forces lurking in the shadows, namely Rigaud (Andy Serkis), a criminal recently-escaped from France with a score to settle at the Clennam house, and a shady young woman named Miss Wade (Maxine Peake), who leads the impressionable young ladies' maid Tattycoram (Freema Agyeman) down a dangerous path.Like most of Dickens' works, LITTLE DORRIT contains a colourful gallery of supporting players, many quite comical (Arthur's jilted childhood sweetheart Flora Finching and her crazy aunt, Amy's sister Fanny and her somewhat simple husband Edmund Sparkler, former convict Mr Cavaletto; and the Plornish family of Bleeding Heart Yard).Charles Dickens originally serialised LITTLE DORRIT between 1855-57, and the same episodic approach is replicated in this miniseries version.  There are hour-length opening and closing episodes with 12 half-hour instalments sandwiched in-between, each one climaxing at a delicious cliffhanger.  Screenwriter Andrew Davies (1995's ""Pride and Prejudice"", ""Daniel Deronda"" and, yes, 2005's ""Bleak House"" to name only a few) knows how to write a cracking costume drama and LITTLE DORRIT is amongst his best work.  It can't have been easy to incorporate the panoramic range of characters in the story and let them all have their own individual moments to shine (Dickens was always famous for his extensive range of characters - in LITTLE DORRIT there are no less than 30 notable figures, all more or less tightly tied into the story of Amy and Arthur); but Davies manages to give them all space to be enjoyed.The BBC wisely decided to cast the role of Amy Dorrit with an unknown, and in Claire Foy they found their ideal heroine.  She is everything you could possibly want in ""Little"" Amy, a demure young girl, so caring and dutiful to her family, yet unwilling to give away her heart, conceal true feelings or suffer fools.  Ms Foy has since gone on to play the spoilt, wilful Lady Persie in the BBC's revamped series of ""Upstairs Downstairs"".  Arthur Clennam is Dickens' most true-hearted (almost too good to be real) hero, a man who is, in the scheme of things, perhaps even more innocent than Amy is, and Matthew Macfadyen is absolutely wonderful in the part.  Andy Serkis is truly chilling as Rigaud, and Alun Armstrong (something of a Dickens veteran with his earlier roles in 1999's ""David Copperfield"" and ""Bleak House"") is very effective as Mrs Clennam's assistant, Flintwinch.  Tom Courtenay's Dorrit is a titanic portrayal which walks the knife-edge of subtle comedy and unbearable tragedy, and his performance will haunt you.The only temptation in watching LITTLE DORRIT will be to properly pace yourself and not watch the entire thing in one sitting!  It was all I could do to turn off the DVD player after 3 or 4 episodes.  This will surely go down as one of the crown jewels in the BBC's considerable canon of literary dramas.

1229851,A3R91AXWLU19N8,B001PU8N0I,DCGUY,"[15, 15]","This is one of Dickens' lesser known works and is given a wonderful screenplay by Andrew Davies who also did the Pride and Prejudice and Bleak House adaptations for BBC TV.  The novel centers on two characters whose lives are changed when the father of one of them dies and triggers a search for answers from the past.  Much of the storyline is taken from Dickens' personal experiences as a young boy when his father was imprisoned in a debtors prison.  The theme of imprisonment pervades the entire storyline and every character is affected by it in one shape or form (physical, psychological, familial, and societal).  Dickens' satire of the pre-Victorian 1826 English society class snobbery, bureaucracy, and greed are displayed by the characters in this novel.The original novel was broken into two parts with Arthur Clennam being the primary focus in the first part and Amy Dorrit in the second part.  This adaptation chose to focus on both characters right away instead of following the original novel time line.  There are many great individual performances in this 7 1/2 hours saga.  The two central characters remain unchanged despite financial, family, and social status pressures.  This adaptation blends humor, sorrow, joy, and a mystery embedded in a love story that transcends time and place.  It is a rare TV event to see such a wide ranging emotional and visually impressive presentation.  Many of the questions that people look for answers like who we will live our lives with, what obligations do parents and children have for each other, and how will we live our lives are brought out from this presentation.  This is a timeless series with a timeless message that what really matters in life is not money, status, or power.I had the opportunity to ask the screenwriter questions on the screenplay adaptation when the series was being broadcast on US TV networks in April 2009.  Mr. Davies changed some of the scenes from the novel to make it with a more contemporary feel and to give the heroine a more dignified and individual character.  The ending of the series also does not follow the novel exactly.  Arthur Clennam gets the answers to his dying father's request in the TV series while the novel leaves some questions unanswered.  Mr. Davies wanted Arthur to have closure and to make for a more emotionally satisfying ending.  The following is taken from Mr. Davies' introduction to the BBC novel edition.--------------------------------------------------------------------------I realized that I would have to simplify and clarify the way the characters are introduced, so that the audience could get a sense of how they interrelate.  I also needed to get a handle on the mystery that lies at the heart of the Clennam household.  The mystery goes back into the past, involving characters that are dead before the book begins.  It revolves around a will, a particular bequest, twin brothers, and a tin box that disappears and then reappears, and it culminates by bringing the house down literally.  I had to consider how to translate all this coherently to television, while laying the clues so that the audience can get a shock of recognition when all is revealed.--------------------------------------------------------------------------The sets, costumes, background scenery, and acting are all first rate with many familiar British actors/actresses in the cast.  A lot of work and effort was done to make this production so special (the makeup work for the Maggy character took over 2 hours).  The heroine, newcomer Claire Foy, becomes the primary focus of the entire story and deservedly so.  Claire called the making of the series like a ""special Christmas gift"".  Kudos to the casting director, Rachel Freck, who brought together a wonderful cast to the series and for her encouragement to Claire Foy which was crucial to her selection for the leading role (she flubbed the first two auditions for the part).  The musical pieces (especially the haunting opening score with the piano and string instrument and Amy Dorrit's pensive mood music scenes when she was thinking about Arthur or was with him - taken from the Chinese music box) are beautifully matched to the story actions throughout the presentation.  Dickens is mostly known for his more popular works such as Oliver Twist, David Copperfield, A Christmas Carol, and Great Expectations.

Well acted for the most part, good cosutme and sets (though if you look closely, you can see some scrimping on sets), and generally true to the Dickens book. Tom Courtenay is outstanding, as is Claire Foy. Claire plays Amy Dorrit, and is charming. One fault that might be found is that she is actually a bit large to be Little Dorrit, mainly in terms of height, but that is a small point to overlook. I feel that both Macfayden and Foy did an excellent job of finding the center of their characters, and thus neither sublimating them nor going ""over the top"" with acting. If there was any point I could find fault with, it would be that the French murderer (forgot his name, at the moment) was a bit too much like a really evil Maurice Chevalier, seemed to play the part a bit TOO French. Overall, though, if you like Charles Dickens, Britlit, costume drama, and a bit of romance, you will not be disappointed with this.

Dickens wrote about class tiers within society, levels of wealth, and the injustices that caused. The Emmy writer, Andrew Davies, condensed the novel, reorganized it's events, and added dialogue into making a series actually considered by some to be better than the Dickens book. That it won 6 Emmys out of 16 BAFTA/EMMY nominations in 11 different area is endorsement enough.Dickens style was not lost. The series includes the caravan of peculiar, grotesque, quirky, and funny characters; the names being equally odd: Flintwich, Pancks, Fanny Sparkler, Pet, Tattycoram, Chivery, Tip, Affery, & Tite Barnacle. Dickens suspense was mingled throughout the 14 episodes, with the overriding plot related to ""Do not forget"" inside a watch, and ""Make it right"" a dad's dying last words, which remains unrevealed till the end (unless you've read the book). Each individual episode ends with suspense, just like Dickens wrote it originally when published in magazine form.Pure Dickens, but better. What fabulous scenes, sets, locations, costumes, hair, dialogue, props, cast, it's all perfection even Dickens would be proud of.  You will fall in love with Amy, Little Dorrit (Claire Foy) much before Arthur (Matthew Macfadyen).  What a delightful adventure into period drama, humor sprinkled, intoxicating, till you can feel the grime of Marshalsea Prison, and sparkle to the glamor of the rich in Venice. A sensual presentation of a rags-to-riches tale.Was it fiction? The bonus material explains that Dickens father spent 14 weeks in the Marshalsea Debtors Prison, and Charles had to work in a factory at age 12 to help meet the financial needs.  Dickens also had a mistress, an unhappy marriage, and well, how much of this is a Dickens bio? A very enlightening, and lengthy, bonus feature.

It was probably the Christmas Carol thing....over saturated from an early age.  I had no interest in reading his books.  I purchased the DVD series because Matthew MacFadyen was in it.  His surprising portrayal of Mr. Darcy in P & P 3, prompted me to seek out his other work, thus ""Little Dorrit.""This story is an highly populated, intertwined, multi-layered, mystery thriller/love story.  It incorporates all the suspense of a mystery novel, with all the elements of a love story, along side the critical commentary of (could it be satire?) the inner-workings of socio-economic mores of 19th century England.A young girl, born in a debtor's prison, living along side her father there, finds employment with a recluse, wealthy, elderly woman who holds grudges and secrets.  Her only son, living abroad with his father, returns to England upon his father's death.  Disillusioned with the family business, as well as disturbed by his fathers' parting words, he seeks out his own employment and begins a quest to uncover a family mystery.  He meets the young girl at his mothers house and begins a journey of self-discovery that intercepts the lives of numerous persons that are all woven together and associated in some way.  It explores the true meaning of wealth and happiness in a moving and poignant way.  It forces you to think of contentment in ways not normally thought of, opening your eyes to the possibility of being satisfied with the lot you were given.  (who would have thought it?)This story is engrossing from the beginning.  And, although, there are numerous characters, each one is fully explored and you have a complete understanding of them.  Even minor characters have place and background in the large scheme of the story, and you never wonder who they are or why they are interjected into the storyline.  So complex and multi-layered is this story, it is confounding how uncomplicated it moves through to the end. It is never convoluted or confused.  Andrew Davies wrote the screenplay, and even though some of his interpretations fall short for me, this has to be one of his best films.The cast is phenomenal.  There is not one weak element among them.  The caliber of performance is astounding!!!  Such fine talent and all working well off of each other.  The characters are rich with depth and personality and the actors seamlessly portray them.There is comedy, social commentary, love, heartbreak, riches, poverty and riches, again.  Although a complicated mystery is evolving, the steady stream of subplots only enforce the storyline.This was well worth the money.  I have purchased the novel and will be plowing through it with great enthusiasm.  This was a pleasure and will be seen several times over as it takes a prominent place in my DVD collection.

I've been watching BBC/Masterpiece Theatre productions since 1971 and this rates among the very best.The adaptation by Andrew Davies manages to include every major episode from Dickens' sprawling book, but makes each more concise and compelling. The story has everything: heroes, villains, mystery, family dysfunction, unrequited love, greed, selflessness - all leavened with hilarious comic bits by some of the quirkier characters.Kudos to the acting company: each actor, whether bit player or star, attacks their role with such brio that viewers will be delighted and pressing the 'rewind' button to watch again. Standouts in a stellar cast are Eddie Marsan as Pancks, Emma Pierson as Fanny, Amanda Redman as Mrs. Merdle (a real hoot), and Russell Tovey as John Chivery (who may bring tears to your eyes). The scenes between newcomer Claire Foy as Little Dorrit and stage/screen vet Tom Courtenay as her father were especially moving.In this series, Amy Dorrit is somewhat more assertive than in the book and previous film, making her more relatable to a modern audience. The age difference between her and Arthur Clennam seemed less extreme, making their relationship more credible as well. Amy and Arthur are such kind, moral characters, they could have seemed cloying or even boring. But their stories are compelling because their goodness is challenged by so many obstacles, yet endures.

1229874,A96AUNSF6GESO,B001PU8N0I,Janeite,"[148, 150]","I only recently read Little Dorrit, and it is my new favorite Dickens novel. The story of Amy Dorrit, an honest girl born in debtor's prison, is a wonderful tale full of ups and downs, trials and tribulations, death and romance. As with many Dickens books, it literally has a cast of thousands, and this production follows most of the storylines from the book quite faithfully. I just watched this on the internet, and I thought this version was sensitive to the material and did a good job of keeping the characters engaging and true while obviously having to shorten Dickens' voluminous descriptions into shorter episodes. The story is a bit of a soap opera with plenty of bad luck and broken hearts lying around. However, it totally works for me. When I read the book, I actually couldn't put it down and devoured it in a couple of days. This movie was the same way. I couldn't stop watching it or wait until the next episode. At the end, I was sitting in front of my computer crying. It is just a lovely story, well-scripted, beautifully acted, and engaging throughout. I haven't ordered my copy yet so I can't speak to any issues with the actual dvd yet, and I will admit that I have thus far been unable to sit through the 1988 version. I want to like it since I've heard so many raves about it (and I adore Derek Jacobi--he's my all time favorite Hamlet) but it moves very slowly and ploddingly to me, and I just lose interest. So I highly recommend this version if you like Dickens at all or if you like any of the actors because the cast (Matthew Macfadyen and Claire Foy especially) do a lovely job. UPDATE: I received my dvd from Amazon and am thrilled to have purchased it. I had seen it on the internet and on Masterpiece (I'm in the US) and the episodes on the dvd are a bit different from what was shown on PBS. The dvd set consists of 4 discs in a widescreen format with 14 episodes coming in at a whopping 452 minutes and includes an interesting ""making of"" feature with info. about Dickens himself as well as the film's production. I'm pretty sure I saw a scene or two here that was missing on PBS, plus I got the widescreen format that I didn't get on my tv. A word of caution: the episodes end in cliff-hangers that make it almost impossible to go to bed without watching ""just one more episode.""

1229875,A106016KSI0YQ,B001PU8N0I,Jay Dickson,"[2, 2]","This may be the best Dickens miniseries yet made by the BBC. After scoring a series of dud literary adaptations in the first decade of the millennium (A ROOM WITH A VIEW, BRIDESHEAD REVISITED), Andrew Davis returned to the metier that served him best in the 1990s with this 2008 multi-part adaptation of a long Victorian novel and reaffirmed the faith many of us had nearly lost in his abilities. Actors have long loved Dickens adaptations because they can take the indelible outlines of characters Dickens provides and make them deeper and richer; it would be hard to imagine a cast that could do better with these parts than we find here. Claire Foy retains the sweetness and loyalty of the title character while also showing us her intelligence and her awareness of the besetting selfishness of her family, while Matthew MacFadyen (still handsome, if less dashing than in his previous roles in THE WAY WE LIVE NOW and PRIDE AND PREJUDICE) is ideal as her well-meaning if blinkered eventual beau Arthur Clennam. The real acting honors, though go to the characters in the more colorful parts: Eddie Marsan as the snorting snuffling Pancks, the crusty rent-collector with the gentle heart; Amanda Redman as the viciously snobbish Mrs. Merdle; Andy Serkis, fully realizing the caricature of an evil Frenchman Dickens draws in Rigaud/Blandois and making him truly loathsome and scary; Tom Courtenay, in the most Lear-like of Dickens' characters, William Dorrit, ""the Father of the Marshalsea""; and above all the estimable Judy Parfitt, subtly showing the great conflicts within the grotesquely proud Mrs. Clennam with the tiniest twitches of her mouth and eyebrows. This seems a more expensive production than many Dickens miniseries, and allows for a very complex vision of London that is alternately sunny and welcome and also claustrophobic and frightening. The greatest set is a magnificent recreation of the Clennams' crumbling house near the Thames, which seems to tremble with the anguish of those within. Davies has some difficulty wrapping up the multiple plot threads in the final episodes (a few are left unexplained, such as the fate of the Gowans and Meagleses), but the production does full justice to Dickens's unforgettable denouement with Mrs. Clennam rising into the streets to beg forgiveness only to see the falling apart of her house with the most truly wicked within it.",5,Houses divided,1281571200,"08 12, 2010",2010,2390,"['may', 'be', 'best', 'Dickens', 'miniseries', 'yet', 'made', 'BBC', 'scoring', 'series', 'dud', 'literary', 'adaptations', 'first', 'decade', 'millennium', 'ROOM', 'WITH', 'A', 'VIEW', 'BRIDESHEAD', 'REVISITED', 'Andrew', 'Davis', 'returned', 'metier', 'served', 'best', '1990s', '2008', 'multi-part', 'adaptation', 'long', 'Victorian', 'novel', 'reaffirmed', 'faith', 'many', 'had', 'nearly', 'lost', 'abilities', 'Actors', 'have', 'long', 'loved', 'Dickens', 'adaptations', 'can', 'take', 'indelible', 'outlines', 'characters', 'Dickens', 'make', 'deeper', 'richer', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'imagine', 'cast', 'could', 'do', 'better', 'parts', 'find', 'here', 'Claire', 'Foy', 'sweetness', 'loyalty', 'title', 'character', 'also', 'showing', 'intelligence', 'awareness', 'besetting', 'selfishness', 'family', 'Matthew', 'MacFadyen', 'still', 'handsome', 'less', 'dashing', 'previous', 'roles', 'WAY', 'WE', 'LIVE', 'NOW', 'PRIDE', 'AND', 'PREJUDICE', 'ideal', 'well-meaning', 'blinkered', 'eventual', 'beau', 'Arthur', 'Clennam', 'real', 'acting', 'honors', 'though', 'go', 'characters', 'more', 'colorful', 'parts', 'Eddie', 'Marsan', 'snorting', 'snuffling', 'Pancks', 'crusty', 'rent-collector', 'gentle', 'heart', 'Amanda', 'Redman', 'viciously', 'snobbish', 'Mrs.', 'Merdle', 'Andy', 'Serkis', 'fully', 'realizing', 'caricature', 'evil', 'Frenchman', 'Dickens', 'Rigaud/Blandois', 'making', 'truly', 'loathsome', 'scary', 'Tom', 'Courtenay', 'most', 'Lear-like', 'Dickens', 'characters', 'William', 'Dorrit', 'Father', 'Marshalsea', 'estimable', 'Judy', 'Parfitt', 'subtly', 'showing', 'great', 'conflicts', 'grotesquely', 'proud', 'Mrs.', 'Clennam', 'tiniest', 'twitches', 'mouth', 'more', 'expensive', 'production', 'many', 'Dickens', 'miniseries', 'very', 'complex', 'vision', 'London', 'alternately', 'sunny', 'welcome', 'also', 'claustrophobic', 'frightening', 'greatest', 'set', 'magnificent', 'recreation', 'Clennams', 'crumbling', 'house', 'Thames', 'tremble', 'anguish', 'Davies', 'difficulty', 'wrapping', 'up', 'multiple', 'plot', 'threads', 'final', 'episodes', 'few', 'are', 'left', 'unexplained', 'such', 'fate', 'Gowans', 'Meagleses', 'production', 'full', 'justice', 'Dickens', 'unforgettable', 'denouement', 'Mrs.', 'Clennam', 'rising', 'streets', 'beg', 'forgiveness', 'only', 'see', 'falling', 'apart', 'house', 'most', 'truly', 'wicked']",N/A
1229876,A1LQLQUJJZUBTC,B001PU8N0I,Jeff  Farrow,"[3, 3]","I agree totally with the 5 stars given in other reviews of this wonderful Dicken's LITTLE DORRIT, including the Masterpiece Theatre's outstanding version of the story. It concerns the odd institution of Old London's debtor's prison.I'm not sure why I never read the book, the title may have thrown me off. It sounded just a little too sentimental--even for the melodramatic style of the great writer. In a sense it is a little different from CD's usual themes of class & oppression. Oh, that exists in LITTLE DORRIT, but there is a more gentle presentation here, balanced by every day life. Dickens' concern for the idea of Forgivness is here too, but not so many people to be forgiven. There is a surprising multi-racial theme as well, but only revealed in full near the conclusion. I am not aware of this idea existing in any other of Dickens'novels. The revealation in the plot very neatly ties up several subthemes. Like so many modern movies, the next to final action in LITTLE DORRITT is a stunning, Armagedon-like destruction. This too was a bit unusual for Dickens--and, of course, it works perfectly under his skilled vision.Also, like so much of CD's work, LITTLE DORRIT is highly autobiographical, perhaps more so than the other novels. The theme of debtor's prison struck home to Dickens because his financially irresponsible father ended up in one. The child Dickens was sent to live & work in a printer's shop in order to pay off his father's debts in order to get him released. It was not a pleasant experience. What hurt the boy most was how easily his mother acquiesced in his forced servitude. He never really got over his feeling of betrayal. Strangely perhaps, he was often less than fair in dealing with his own wife & children (there is a character in the book who is a rather cruel parody of his overweight wife.). All this aside, LITTLE DORRIT is neither an angry or bitter tale. It is more a love story told in the many facets of that emotion.If you're building a DVD library, you've got to include Dickens; and if you are building a Dickens section, this version of LITTLE DORRIT is an absolutely essential. Oh, yes...The book/movie is called ""Little"" Dorrit because the main character is short statured. I really didn't particularly notice this in Claire Foy who plays Dorrit. What I did notice is that she is a wonderful actress--and the actress playing her fickle yet loyal sister was excellent as well. I liked her make-up, sort of Edwardian-Gheisa.

I wonder if we will look back at this in 20-30-or-40 years and applaud it for following the book more closely than the 1988 production ?  Or...will we instead be fixated on the over-the-top dark melodramatic style.  Lemony-Snicketish if you will.  I think this style of production will eventually run its' course and look terribly dated.In my opinion many of the characters were overplayed, the sets were hyped, and there was an overall lack of genuine human spirit.  I had thought that Dickens was rather a master at portraying the different facets of human nature through his quirky characters.  The exaggerated acting style and effects detracted from that mastery.That said, I did finish it because I was not familiar with this novel and was interested in the plot.  The leads, Foy and McFayden helped save the production, although I did find Foy's ""Little Dorrit"" somewhat static.  She never did seem to fully transform from a girl into a young woman, capable of an undying love.  I loved Mr. Panck's, Mr. Chivaree, and in general, the young gatehouse keeper John.

(It's got 7.5 hours to do it too...)The acting was superb- I can't remember when I've seen better. The scenery was very detailed, and the costumes were very believable. Every last detail in the plot was intricately planned out to give you the feeling of being there with the Dorrits and the Meagles and the Clennams. And the murderer.Tom Courtenay stood out as an excellent actor. Though I hated the way his character changed to one of pride for half of the series, that was his job as an actor, and he did it well.Matthew Macfayden couldn't have done better. Those who loved him in ""Pride and Prejudice,"" won't be disappointed, though it's a strange to see him smile so much as opposed to his role as Mr Darcy. (But that's a good thing.) And as a matter of fact, if you didn't like him as Darcy in Pride and Prejudice, try him as Arthur Clennam. The difference is astounding.Claire Foy fit the role of ""Little"" Amy Dorrit perfectly. She made it all believable, pulling the strands of each character to the center of the story. The performances of the other actors were certainly great work and with time and space, each could be given a whole review on their own.Pros: Great acting by all the characters (love them or not)Lovely soundtrack. (Really, the music stands out. Unfortunately, there's no soundtrack CD or MP3)Very memorable quotes. (For a person who loves quotes, that's fantastic.)The movie has a good deal of heartbreaking scenes, and a good deal of hilarious ones as well.When you see Flora Finching, get ready to laugh.Cons: Some amount of swearing though not an extremely excessive amount.Hints of a questionable character in the obscure Miss Wade. Her role is unlikable to say the least. It plays a very small part in the story, and I still haven't quite gotten why she was necessary to the plot. She lures a girl away from her family to her home. Her purpose in doing this wasn't quite clear, and much is left to the imagination.A couple of graphic scenes, one involving a murder, the other involving suicide. The latter is more graphic than the first, and might bother younger children especially.Rigaud (the murderer) plays the part of a french villan,  and at times gets too free with women. This is limited to kissing for the most part in the second episode; after that, he goes around charming (or trying to charm) every female in his path. He was too much of a womanizer for my liking.Though I was happy for Amy and Arthur, I really felt bad for John Chivery. He was an unforgettable character, broken-hearted over young Amy, yet loyal forever, and in his words, (he was fond of composing his own epitaph.) ""Here lie the mortal remains of John Chivery, Assistant Turnkey and later Chief Turnkey of the Marshalsea Prison for Debt. He was unlucky in love and endured a good deal of sorrow, but he rose above it and performed many an act of kindness, even to his rival. And always engraved, on stone, deep into his very heart, is the name of ""Amy Dorrit"".From the humor of the Circumlocution Office and Mrs. F's Aunt to the heartbreaking lines of John Chivery, to the smile that will be on your face at the end of the movie, it makes for a truly unforgettable experience. Sometimes you'll cry, sometimes you will be laughing.In short, ""Little Dorrit"" is a movie I'm not likely to forget. I'll be keeping it for a long while.Hats off to the BBC.Once again, they've produced a classic.",5,"It's Going on My ""Favorites List""",1358294400,"01 16, 2013",2013,3872,"['Amy', 'Little', 'Dorrit', 'type', 'series', 'when', 'over', 'sit', 'thinking', 'daze', 'Okay', 'now', 'what', 'should', 'do', 'Truly', 'think', 'long', 'while', 'afterwards', 'Then', 'go', 'find', 'more', 'knowing', 'while', 'gem.I', ""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'Little', 'Dorrit', ""'m"", 'not', 'one', 'say', 'how', 'closely', 'original', 'story', 'line', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'pretty', 'close', 'ideas', 'novel', 'got', '7.5', 'hours', 'do', 'too', 'acting', 'was', 'superb-', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'when', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'better', 'scenery', 'was', 'very', 'detailed', 'costumes', 'were', 'very', 'believable', 'last', 'detail', 'plot', 'was', 'intricately', 'planned', 'out', 'give', 'feeling', 'being', 'Dorrits', 'Meagles', 'Clennams', 'murderer.Tom', 'Courtenay', 'stood', 'out', 'excellent', 'actor', 'hated', 'way', 'character', 'changed', 'one', 'pride', 'half', 'series', 'was', 'job', 'actor', 'did', 'well.Matthew', 'Macfayden', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'done', 'better', 'who', 'loved', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'strange', 'see', 'smile', 'so', 'much', 'opposed', 'role', 'Mr', 'Darcy', 'good', 'thing', 'matter', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'Darcy', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'try', 'Arthur', 'Clennam', 'difference', 'astounding.Claire', 'Foy', 'fit', 'role', 'Little', 'Amy', 'Dorrit', 'perfectly', 'made', 'believable', 'pulling', 'strands', 'character', 'center', 'story', 'performances', 'other', 'actors', 'were', 'certainly', 'great', 'work', 'time', 'space', 'could', 'be', 'given', 'whole', 'review', 'own.Pros', 'Great', 'acting', 'characters', 'love', 'not', 'Lovely', 'soundtrack', 'Really', 'music', 'out', 'Unfortunately', 'soundtrack', 'CD', 'MP3', 'Very', 'memorable', 'quotes', 'person', 'who', 'quotes', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'good', 'deal', 'heartbreaking', 'scenes', 'good', 'deal', 'hilarious', 'ones', 'well.When', 'see', 'Flora', 'Finching', 'get', 'ready', 'laugh.Cons', 'amount', 'swearing', 'not', 'extremely', 'excessive', 'amount.Hints', 'questionable', 'character', 'obscure', 'Miss', 'Wade', 'role', 'unlikable', 'say', 'least', 'very', 'small', 'part', 'story', 'still', 'have', ""n't"", 'quite', 'gotten', 'why', 'was', 'necessary', 'plot', 'girl', 'away', 'family', 'home', 'purpose', 'doing', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'clear', 'much', 'left', 'imagination.A', 'couple', 'graphic', 'scenes', 'one', 'involving', 'murder', 'other', 'involving', 'suicide', 'latter', 'more', 'graphic', 'first', 'might', 'bother', 'younger', 'children', 'especially.Rigaud', 'murderer', 'part', 'french', 'villan', 'times', 'too', 'free', 'women', 'limited', 'kissing', 'most', 'part', 'second', 'episode', 'charming', 'trying', 'charm', 'female', 'path', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'womanizer', 'liking.Though', 'was', 'happy', 'Amy', 'Arthur', 'really', 'felt', 'bad', 'John', 'Chivery', 'was', 'unforgettable', 'character', 'broken-hearted', 'young', 'Amy', 'yet', 'loyal', 'forever', 'words', 'was', 'fond', 'composing', 'own', 'epitaph', 'Here', 'mortal', 'John', 'Chivery', 'Assistant', 'Turnkey', 'later', 'Chief', 'Turnkey', 'Marshalsea', 'Prison', 'Debt', 'was', 'unlucky', 'love', 'endured', 'good', 'deal', 'sorrow', 'rose', 'performed', 'many', 'act', 'kindness', 'even', 'rival', 'always', 'engraved', 'stone', 'deep', 'very', 'heart', 'name', 'Amy', 'Dorrit', 'humor', 'Circumlocution', 'Office', 'Mrs.', 'F', 'Aunt', 'heartbreaking', 'lines', 'John', 'Chivery', 'smile', 'will', 'be', 'face', 'end', 'movie', 'truly', 'unforgettable', 'experience', 'Sometimes', ""'ll"", 'cry', 'sometimes', 'will', 'be', 'laughing.In', 'short', 'Little', 'Dorrit', 'movie', ""'m"", 'not', 'likely', 'forget', ""'ll"", 'be', 'keeping', 'long', 'while.Hats', 'BBC.Once', 'again', ""'ve"", 'produced', 'classic']",N/A

All of the players perform marvelously; however, it is Claire Foy's incandescence which essentially carries this film. If the viewer does not literally/figuratively fall in love with Amy Dorrit, an ECG and an EEG are in order. Miss Foy's Amy Dorrit is the single most engaging silver-screen character I've encountered in several decades...the last being Kinski's Tess.Little Dorrit, the film, does not have the sweep, majesty and poetry of Polanski's Tess of the D'Urbervilles (vast budget differential), but Dorrit's primary characters are more convincingly realized, in my opinion. One cannot legitimately compare the dramatic arrow of Dorrit with Tess...Dickens and Hardy inspected their respective worlds with entirely different lenses. Both heroines represent the archetypal ideal of purity and ingenuous innocence for whom you fear brutal violation. Therein lies the fundamental difference of the two novels. Dorrit is  dramatic (brief violence) with comedic relief. Tess; pure tragedy.This is a complex multi-layered tapestry; carded, spun, dyed and designed by a master, woven here by several hands (directors), and filled with the typically Dickensonian collection of caricatures (who the medical world names syndromes after) which are animated with colorful aplomb.This film requires patience, as the warp and weft are methodically shuttled and combed with deliberate care. There are flaws in the weave, but these are peripheral. The two central characters  (Amy Dorrit and Arthur Clennam) retain their noble integrity through every vicissitude. The secondary characters are so superb, you grow to love, tolerate, empathize with or hate them as intended. Marked over-length with trivial tangents, minor mis-casting, and un-necessary scenes are some of its flaws.Your patience will be thoroughly rewarded in the final two chapters as you are inexorably pulled into the very fibers of the tapestry. Miss Foy's skills are unrivaled in the transcendence, power and authenticity she breathes into Amy. Her ethereal essence escapes the confines of the screen and fills the room with warmth, sweetness and light. To share one's life with such a being! Alas, we must settle for these 7.5 hours with her, and Arthur Clennam (only slightly less divine). Little Dorrit's infectious goodness charms even the worst of our species.Father Dorrit, John Chivery, Mrs Clennam, Mr Pancks, Affrey, Auntie, and Rigaud are all magnificent; unforgettable...you will journey with these individuals a long time, I suspect. Amy will accompany you to your eternal rest.Foy (Little Dorrit), Tovey (John Chivery), Courtenay (William Dorrit), and E. Marsan (Pancks)should be giving acting lessons to our icons who pull down 10-20 million a picture.Timely sermon, given the Rigauds and Merdles that surround us; that have always surrounded us.The product packaging, for a retail $50. set, is pathetically parsimonious.",5,Power of Goodness,1242864000,"05 21, 2009",2009,3138,"['timeless', '7.5', 'hour', 'exposition', 'disarming', 'power', 'simple', 'goodness', 'uncorrupted', 'money', 'societal', 'censure', 'familial', 'decadence.The', 'British', 'seem', 'have', 'endless', 'procession', 'superb', 'character', 'actors', 'many', 'whom', 'are', 'employed', 'here', 'players', 'perform', 'marvelously', 'however', 'Claire', 'Foy', 'incandescence', 'essentially', 'film', 'viewer', 'not', 'literally/figuratively', 'fall', 'love', 'Amy', 'Dorrit', 'ECG', 'EEG', 'are', 'order', 'Miss', 'Foy', 'Amy', 'Dorrit', 'single', 'most', 'engaging', 'silver-screen', 'character', ""'ve"", 'encountered', 'several', 'decades', 'last', 'being', 'Kinski', 'Tess.Little', 'Dorrit', 'film', 'not', 'have', 'sweep', 'majesty', 'poetry', 'Polanski', 'Tess', ""D'Urbervilles"", 'vast', 'budget', 'differential', 'Dorrit', 'primary', 'characters', 'are', 'more', 'convincingly', 'realized', 'opinion', 'One', 'can', 'not', 'legitimately', 'compare', 'dramatic', 'arrow', 'Dorrit', 'Tess', 'Dickens', 'Hardy', 'inspected', 'respective', 'worlds', 'entirely', 'different', 'lenses', 'heroines', 'represent', 'archetypal', 'ideal', 'purity', 'ingenuous', 'innocence', 'whom', 'fear', 'brutal', 'violation', 'Therein', 'fundamental', 'difference', 'two', 'novels', 'Dorrit', 'dramatic', 'brief', 'violence', 'comedic', 'relief', 'Tess', 'pure', 'tragedy.This', 'complex', 'multi-layered', 'tapestry', 'carded', 'spun', 'dyed', 'designed', 'master', 'woven', 'here', 'several', 'hands', 'directors', 'filled', 'typically', 'Dickensonian', 'collection', 'caricatures', 'who', 'medical', 'world', 'names', 'syndromes', 'are', 'animated', 'colorful', 'aplomb.This', 'film', 'patience', 'warp', 'weft', 'are', 'methodically', 'shuttled', 'combed', 'deliberate', 'care', 'are', 'flaws', 'weave', 'are', 'peripheral', 'two', 'central', 'characters', 'Amy', 'Dorrit', 'Arthur', 'Clennam', 'retain', 'noble', 'integrity', 'vicissitude', 'secondary', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'superb', 'grow', 'love', 'tolerate', 'empathize', 'hate', 'intended', 'Marked', 'over-length', 'trivial', 'tangents', 'minor', 'mis-casting', 'un-necessary', 'scenes', 'are', 'flaws.Your', 'patience', 'will', 'be', 'thoroughly', 'rewarded', 'final', 'two', 'chapters', 'are', 'inexorably', 'pulled', 'very', 'fibers', 'tapestry', 'Miss', 'Foy', 'skills', 'are', 'unrivaled', 'transcendence', 'power', 'authenticity', 'Amy', 'ethereal', 'essence', 'confines', 'screen', 'room', 'warmth', 'sweetness', 'light', 'share', 'one', 'life', 'being', 'Alas', 'must', 'settle', '7.5', 'hours', 'Arthur', 'Clennam', 'only', 'slightly', 'less', 'divine', 'Little', 'Dorrit', 'infectious', 'goodness', 'charms', 'even', 'worst', 'species.Father', 'Dorrit', 'John', 'Chivery', 'Mrs', 'Clennam', 'Mr', 'Pancks', 'Affrey', 'Auntie', 'Rigaud', 'are', 'magnificent', 'unforgettable', 'will', 'journey', 'individuals', 'long', 'time', 'suspect', 'Amy', 'will', 'accompany', 'eternal', 'rest.Foy', 'Little', 'Dorrit', 'Tovey', 'John', 'Chivery', 'Courtenay', 'William', 'Dorrit', 'E.', 'Marsan', 'Pancks', 'should', 'be', 'giving', 'acting', 'lessons', 'icons', 'who', 'pull', 'down', '10-20', 'million', 'picture.Timely', 'sermon', 'given', 'Rigauds', 'Merdles', 'surround', 'have', 'always', 'surrounded', 'us.The', 'product', 'packaging', 'retail', '50', 'set', 'pathetically', 'parsimonious']",N/A

Schumacher,"[2, 3]","Both this, the 2008 BBC version, and the 1988 film, of Little Dorrit are really good, and each has its strengths and weaknesses.The 1988 version was filmed for the big screen (shown in theaters as two separate movies), so it doesn't have the see-their-pores closeups of the 2008 version.  This gives the newer version an intimate feel, but loses some of the epic scope.The newer version has far more sumptuous scenery, but the Marshalsea (Debtors' Prison) is not as cramped or squalid.  The newer version's prison apparently was a thinly rehabbed church or college, and hardly looks punitive at all.The two Amy (Little) Dorrits are certainly different.  The earlier one is mousy and stoic the entire way through (actually closer to the book), whereas the newer one is spunky and feisty and constantly chafing at restraints--more admirable, but less like Dickens.The two William Dorrits are also very different.  Alec Guinness, in the earlier one, plays him as a grandiloquent narcissist, blithely sponging and never doubting his entitlement.  Tom Courtenay, in the later, plays him as a nervous, constantly self-doubting wreck.  Guinness's interpretation is more fun to watch, and has much more dramatic punch when, in the banquet scene, William cracks up and becomes human.The later version is more literal, and leaves nothing out.  The earlier one left out Rigaud/Lagnier/Blandois, and really this is not much of a loss.

When Arthur Clennam returns to England after many years abroad in China, he goes on a quest to discover the truth about 'Little Dorrit', as Amy is called, who works as a seamstress for his mother, and particularly how her father came to be in the Marshalsea.Filled with murderers, liars, deceit, destruction, cunning & much more, this story is filled to the brim with interesting and unique characters, as only Charles Dickens could give us: from rags to riches is this story, showing the best and worst of 1820's British society:As always, I was a little reluctant to put this in to watch, as Dickens is almost always notoriously depressing at times ~ he did not disappoint in this instance, nor, I find, did Andrew Davies and the BBC...the whole thing was most excellently done!  I was well pleased with the actors & actresses chosen, they played their parts well: the story was both intriguing and gripping, and I found that I just couldn't wait until the end to find out the truth that some characters were trying so very hard to hide.For those of you worried about family-friendly content, in typical Dickens fashion this story is filled with evil characters, dark species of men, and wicked women: there lots of unsavory things going on, most of them revolving around murders, violence and betrayal!  Everything was handled with taste, however, but I would not recommend this for the young: there is a bit of language, some violence, adult situations, lots of threatening of beatings, flirting, seduction, etc.I would recommend this as another exceptionally well-done Dickens tale, with the full 452 minutes doing the story every bit of justice it deserves: not for the faint of heart, but this series is cut into little bit-sized 27 minute pieces (except for the 1st and Last Episode) ~ I greatly enjoyed this series!",5,Another series well done from Andrew Davies & the BBC!,1259366400,"11 28, 2009",2009,2094,"['Delve', 'exciting', 'story', 'Dorrits', 'head', 'Dorrit', 'long', 'prisoner', 'famous', 'Marshalsea', 'Debtors', 'Prison', 'son', 'two', 'daughters', 'come', 'often', 'visit', 'one', 'called', 'Amy', 'stays', 'also', 'work', 'gain', 'money', 'upkeep', 'When', 'Arthur', 'Clennam', 'England', 'many', 'years', 'abroad', 'China', 'quest', 'discover', 'truth', ""'Little"", 'Dorrit', 'Amy', 'called', 'who', 'seamstress', 'mother', 'particularly', 'how', 'father', 'came', 'be', 'Marshalsea.Filled', 'murderers', 'liars', 'deceit', 'destruction', 'cunning', 'much', 'more', 'story', 'filled', 'brim', 'interesting', 'unique', 'characters', 'only', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'could', 'give', 'rags', 'riches', 'story', 'showing', 'best', 'worst', '1820', 'British', 'society', 'always', 'was', 'little', 'reluctant', 'put', 'watch', 'Dickens', 'almost', 'always', 'notoriously', 'depressing', 'times', '~', 'did', 'not', 'disappoint', 'instance', 'find', 'did', 'Andrew', 'Davies', 'BBC', 'whole', 'thing', 'was', 'most', 'excellently', 'done', 'was', 'well', 'pleased', 'actors', 'actresses', 'chosen', 'played', 'parts', 'well', 'story', 'was', 'intriguing', 'gripping', 'found', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'end', 'find', 'out', 'truth', 'characters', 'were', 'trying', 'so', 'very', 'hard', 'hide.For', 'worried', 'family-friendly', 'content', 'typical', 'Dickens', 'fashion', 'story', 'filled', 'evil', 'characters', 'dark', 'species', 'men', 'wicked', 'women', 'lots', 'unsavory', 'things', 'going', 'most', 'revolving', 'murders', 'violence', 'betrayal', 'Everything', 'was', 'handled', 'taste', 'however', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'young', 'bit', 'language', 'violence', 'adult', 'situations', 'lots', 'threatening', 'beatings', 'flirting', 'seduction', 'etc.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'exceptionally', 'well-done', 'Dickens', 'tale', 'full', '452', 'minutes', 'doing', 'story', 'bit', 'justice', 'not', 'faint', 'heart', 'series', 'cut', 'little', 'bit-sized', '27', 'minute', 'pieces', '1st', 'Last', 'Episode', '~', 'greatly', 'enjoyed', 'series']",N/A

This particular adaptation is very faithful to the original work, perhaps overly so, yet the incredible cast makes this production top-quality period drama.Typical of Dickens' work, there is much focus on the differences between the upper and lower strata in society. Matthew MacFadyen plays Arthur Clennam, who returns from abroad to find his emotionally-detached mother [played by Judy Parfitt] employing an impoverished young woman, Amy ""Little"" Dorrit [ an almost luminescent Claire Foy] who was basically born and bred in debtor's prison where her father William [Tom Courtenay]has been incarcerated for more than two decades. She goes back to tend to his needs on the weekends. Arthur begins to fear that his mother is concealing some dark secrets and that his family may be involved in bringing about the Dorrits' downfall, and the well-intentioned young man goes about remedying the situation. The kind-hearted  Amy falls for Arthur but the path of true love doesn't run very smoothly here, and it takes some convoluted plot twists.On the whole, the casting was well-done but I did find the actress playing Tattycoram to be more annoying than convincing in her performance. I also thought that the scenes with Ms Wade [Maxine Peake] were overly-dramatized. Though this production stays very faithful to the book, it could have done with some editing, as the story itself is laborious and can be quite daunting to a viewer unfamiliar with the book, noting the complex cast of characters and their relationship to one another.I would definitely recommend this production of ""Little Dorrit"" to fans of British period dramas, and especially to those who love Dickens' work. It would perhaps be prudent to read the book before watching this drama if only to refresh one's memory of the intricate storyline, especially considering that the last hour of the production seems like a rushed attempt to iron out the plot towards its conclusion.",5,"Lavish and well-cast production of Dickens' ""Little Dorrit""",1238976000,"04 6, 2009",2009,2141,"['screenplay', 'acclaimed', 'Andrew', 'Davies', '[', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'screenplays', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'Bleak', 'House', 'etc', ']', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'Little', 'Dorrit', 'alive', 'onscreen', 'shown', 'PBS', 'particular', 'adaptation', 'very', 'faithful', 'original', 'work', 'perhaps', 'overly', 'so', 'incredible', 'cast', 'production', 'top-quality', 'period', 'drama.Typical', 'Dickens', 'work', 'much', 'focus', 'differences', 'upper', 'lower', 'strata', 'society', 'Matthew', 'MacFadyen', 'Arthur', 'Clennam', 'who', 'abroad', 'find', 'emotionally-detached', 'mother', '[', 'played', 'Judy', 'Parfitt', ']', 'employing', 'impoverished', 'young', 'woman', 'Amy', 'Little', 'Dorrit', '[', 'almost', 'luminescent', 'Claire', 'Foy', ']', 'who', 'was', 'basically', 'born', 'bred', 'debtor', 'prison', 'where', 'father', 'William', '[', 'Tom', 'Courtenay', ']', 'been', 'incarcerated', 'more', 'two', 'decades', 'back', 'tend', 'needs', 'weekends', 'Arthur', 'fear', 'mother', 'concealing', 'dark', 'secrets', 'family', 'may', 'be', 'involved', 'bringing', 'Dorrits', 'downfall', 'well-intentioned', 'young', 'man', 'remedying', 'situation', 'kind-hearted', 'Amy', 'Arthur', 'path', 'true', 'love', ""n't"", 'run', 'very', 'smoothly', 'here', 'convoluted', 'plot', 'whole', 'casting', 'was', 'well-done', 'did', 'find', 'actress', 'playing', 'Tattycoram', 'be', 'more', 'annoying', 'convincing', 'performance', 'also', 'thought', 'scenes', 'Ms', 'Wade', '[', 'Maxine', 'Peake', ']', 'were', 'overly-dramatized', 'production', 'very', 'faithful', 'book', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'editing', 'story', 'laborious', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'daunting', 'viewer', 'unfamiliar', 'book', 'noting', 'complex', 'cast', 'characters', 'relationship', 'one', 'another.I', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'production', 'Little', 'Dorrit', 'fans', 'British', 'period', 'dramas', 'especially', 'who', 'love', 'Dickens', 'work', 'would', 'perhaps', 'be', 'prudent', 'read', 'book', 'watching', 'drama', 'only', 'refresh', 'one', 'memory', 'intricate', 'storyline', 'especially', 'considering', 'last', 'hour', 'production', 'rushed', 'attempt', 'iron', 'out', 'plot', 'conclusion']",N/A
