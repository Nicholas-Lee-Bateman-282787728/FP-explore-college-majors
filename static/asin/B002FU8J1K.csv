So there is no need to convince you that this is a great collection. But I will say that the time and care given to the complete details of not only the world series, but also to the division and championship series footage leading up to it, are a must for anyone looking to relive this amazing world series. Too many other sets have only highlights, so to be able to watch the complete games was a joy.",5,Fantastic DVD Set!,1347494400,"09 13, 2012",2012,552,"['First', 'all', ""'re"", 'looking', 'set', ""'re"", 'Yankees', 'fan', 'just', 'fan', 'Baseball', 'general', 'someone', 'who', 'really', 'Phillies', 'So', 'need', 'convince', 'great', 'collection', 'will', 'say', 'time', 'care', 'given', 'complete', 'details', 'not', 'only', 'world', 'series', 'also', 'division', 'championship', 'series', 'footage', 'leading', 'up', 'are', 'must', 'anyone', 'looking', 'relive', 'amazing', 'world', 'series', 'Too', 'many', 'other', 'sets', 'have', 'only', 'highlights', 'so', 'be', 'able', 'watch', 'complete', 'games', 'was', 'joy']",N/A
