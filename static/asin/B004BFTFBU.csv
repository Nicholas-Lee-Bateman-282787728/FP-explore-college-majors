1395391,A2UMA3ZKBM9OLW,B004BFTFBU,Tommy in Texas,"[3, 3]","Based on the awesome reviews I had very high expectations for this &#34;movie&#34;.  They were too high.This is not a movie and not even a documentary.  Instead its a somewhat random collection of guys talking about how much they love football and their positive memories from playing it in their youth.  It's kind of like being a fly on the wall at a party where you don't know any of the attendees and you are just listening to their stories.  If you have actually played football yourself, you have your own stories and can get together with your actual friends and have a real party.Those looking for actual football movies should look to classics such as the following:- Rudy, Radio, Blind Side, Facing the Giants, Longest Yard, and the comedy Waterboy",2,Was hoping for more of a story or documentary,1381968000,"10 17, 2013",2013,757,"['Based', 'awesome', 'reviews', 'had', 'very', 'high', 'expectations', '34', 'movie', '34', 'were', 'too', 'high.This', 'not', 'movie', 'not', 'even', 'documentary', 'Instead', 'somewhat', 'random', 'collection', 'guys', 'talking', 'how', 'much', 'love', 'football', 'positive', 'memories', 'playing', 'youth', 'kind', 'being', 'fly', 'wall', 'party', 'where', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'attendees', 'are', 'just', 'listening', 'stories', 'have', 'actually', 'played', 'football', 'have', 'own', 'stories', 'can', 'get', 'together', 'actual', 'friends', 'have', 'real', 'party.Those', 'looking', 'actual', 'football', 'movies', 'should', 'look', 'classics', 'such', 'following', 'Rudy', 'Radio', 'Blind', 'Side', 'Facing', 'Giants', 'Longest', 'Yard', 'comedy', 'Waterboy']",N/A
1395392,AP3B615GM191G,B004BFTFBU,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[37, 37]","Though the National Football League is ""king of the hill"" right now in terms of organized sports, this documentary takes a look at football on the high school level, with input from coaches and players from all aspects of the sports' history.The great thing about this DVD, based on the Kenny Chesney song of the same name, is that everybody can relate to its message, which is the spectacle of the action under the friday night lights.  From the fans to the coaches, and the players to the pep band, nearly everyone was has lived can remember those innocent high school nights and not help but be caught up in a wave of nostalgia.What really hooks you, though, is the input from high-profile guests like John Madden (good to hear that voice again!), Brett Favre, Troy Aikman, and a long list of famous coaches from the college ranks, to name but a few.  In this relaxed, chit-chat type setting, all the pressures of winning and losing are cast aside, and the simple joy and life experience of playing the game are touched on.  When all the X's and O's and the business aspects of the game are stripped away, it quickly becomes clear the power that team sports can have in not only shaping teams, but also individuals in other aspects of life away from the football field.Basically, this is just a great little documentary to watch if you are sick of the pomp and circumstance of the NFL and just want to get back to football's roots: a group of guys coming together as individuals to form a team and try to win instead of lose together.  It really isn't any more complicated than that, despite all our attempts to make it so.  Thus, this is the perfect gift for the pigskin-head in your family.  It may not remain in the entertainment center for good, but it will make an impression on the first viewing, that is for sure.",5,Football For The Heart & Soul,1290297600,"11 21, 2010",2010,1823,"['National', 'Football', 'League', 'king', 'hill', 'right', 'now', 'terms', 'organized', 'sports', 'documentary', 'look', 'football', 'high', 'school', 'level', 'input', 'coaches', 'players', 'aspects', 'sports', 'history.The', 'great', 'thing', 'DVD', 'based', 'Kenny', 'Chesney', 'song', 'same', 'name', 'everybody', 'can', 'relate', 'message', 'spectacle', 'action', 'friday', 'night', 'lights', 'fans', 'coaches', 'players', 'pep', 'band', 'nearly', 'everyone', 'was', 'lived', 'can', 'remember', 'innocent', 'high', 'school', 'nights', 'not', 'help', 'be', 'caught', 'up', 'wave', 'nostalgia.What', 'really', 'though', 'input', 'high-profile', 'guests', 'John', 'Madden', 'good', 'hear', 'voice', 'again', 'Brett', 'Favre', 'Troy', 'Aikman', 'long', 'list', 'famous', 'coaches', 'college', 'ranks', 'name', 'few', 'relaxed', 'chit-chat', 'type', 'setting', 'pressures', 'winning', 'losing', 'are', 'cast', 'aside', 'simple', 'joy', 'life', 'experience', 'playing', 'game', 'are', 'touched', 'When', 'X', 'O', 'business', 'aspects', 'game', 'are', 'stripped', 'away', 'quickly', 'clear', 'power', 'team', 'sports', 'can', 'have', 'not', 'only', 'shaping', 'teams', 'also', 'individuals', 'other', 'aspects', 'life', 'away', 'football', 'field.Basically', 'just', 'great', 'little', 'documentary', 'watch', 'are', 'sick', 'pomp', 'circumstance', 'NFL', 'just', 'want', 'get', 'back', 'football', 'roots', 'group', 'guys', 'coming', 'together', 'individuals', 'form', 'team', 'try', 'win', 'instead', 'lose', 'together', 'really', ""n't"", 'more', 'complicated', 'attempts', 'make', 'so', 'Thus', 'perfect', 'gift', 'pigskin-head', 'family', 'may', 'not', 'remain', 'entertainment', 'center', 'good', 'will', 'make', 'impression', 'first', 'viewing', 'sure']",N/A
