The best part is you can choose several different short 10-15 min. routines and put them in any order through the menu interface! Wow, what a lovely way to do it. You choose the sequence. It's not choppy like some of the other DVD's I've tried with this function.I love ball workouts. I'm not a big lover of pilates, but this one is great! Most of it is fairly easy, but you make it what you will like any exersize routines. Some of her bridge poses are a bit difficult, so it does have some challenges.Well worth the money if you're looking for a good balance ball routine.

I have to be real careful to not use wts, as I have chronic myofascial pain, I also have fibro, for anyone considering if they should try this or not.  I really love it!  I stretch as much, or sometimes NOt as much as I can, whatever suits me at that time.  I always feel so good about myself and my  balance after doing this workout.  I know that out of all my video's, this is my favorite.  It's 50 min, which if someone told me that, I wouldn't even bother, but it's very relaxed and slow stretches.  At this time and point, I think this is the best exercise for me. Kathy Smith was my all time favorite and 'The Firm', but I can no longer do those anymore,.  I no longer feel that I'm 'missing out' of my workouts, this one is great and I can actually keep up with it!  I hope you try this, it may be the best for you too.

842495,A3K4OSWZE8GZAZ,B0002OXUPG,E. Evans,"[54, 74]","I love my new stability ball and I love to exercise. I do not, however, love this DVD. I tolerate it and that's about it!The best aspect of the DVD is that it is easy to navigate. There is an introduction, a section of fundamentals, and three pilates-based exercise routines (warm-up, core, upper body). I do like that you can select the sections you want to do in order to create your own workout.I like to be lead through instruction. That way it feels like you are in an exercise class and is more ""personal"". In this video, the instructor used voice-over after the fact to give the instructions. I just find it a bit eery to watch an stone-faced instructor while a disembodied voice tells me to inhale and exhale!I also find the title a bit misleading. I don't think you would lose a lot of weight doing this video alone as it is toning and not cardio at all. It also has a bit of a ""New Age"" vibe to it, which is a turn-off to me.If you are a beginning exerciser and the above problems don't both you, this DVD may be appropriate for you.",2,"A little too ""New Age"" For Me",1104710400,"01 3, 2005",2005,1043,"['love', 'new', 'stability', 'ball', 'love', 'exercise', 'do', 'not', 'however', 'love', 'DVD', 'tolerate', 'best', 'aspect', 'DVD', 'easy', 'navigate', 'introduction', 'section', 'fundamentals', 'three', 'pilates-based', 'exercise', 'routines', 'warm-up', 'core', 'body', 'do', 'can', 'select', 'sections', 'want', 'do', 'order', 'create', 'own', 'workout.I', 'be', 'lead', 'instruction', 'way', 'are', 'exercise', 'class', 'more', 'personal', 'video', 'instructor', 'used', 'voice-over', 'fact', 'give', 'instructions', 'just', 'find', 'bit', 'eery', 'watch', 'stone-faced', 'instructor', 'disembodied', 'voice', 'tells', 'inhale', 'exhale', 'also', 'find', 'title', 'bit', 'misleading', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'lose', 'lot', 'weight', 'doing', 'video', 'alone', 'toning', 'not', 'cardio', 'also', 'bit', 'New', 'Age', 'vibe', 'turn-off', 'me.If', 'are', 'beginning', 'exerciser', 'above', 'problems', 'do', ""n't"", 'both', 'DVD', 'may', 'be', 'appropriate']",Balance Ball For Weight Loss

Susan's cuing is excellent, the breathing is very important and you first have to get the hang of it, and I think the workout will be even more effective once you have the breathing down pat.  Its not an exciting video, but if I had wanted that I would've purchased something else.  This is my third Susan Deason DVD and the background music is always lovely during her workouts, her voice is very soothing, and her instruction is excellent.",4,Excellent DVD,1242000000,"05 11, 2009",2009,536,"['tried', 'out', 'yesterday', 'was', 'surprised', 'really', 'Pilates', 'workout', 'ball', 'Susan', 'cuing', 'excellent', 'breathing', 'very', 'important', 'first', 'have', 'get', 'hang', 'think', 'workout', 'will', 'be', 'even', 'more', 'effective', 'once', 'have', 'breathing', 'down', 'pat', 'not', 'exciting', 'video', 'had', 'wanted', 'would', ""'ve"", 'purchased', 'something', 'else', 'third', 'Susan', 'Deason', 'DVD', 'background', 'music', 'always', 'lovely', 'workouts', 'voice', 'very', 'soothing', 'instruction', 'excellent']",Balance Ball For Weight Loss

While I do love my balance ball, this video was so slow, and not challenging one bit.
