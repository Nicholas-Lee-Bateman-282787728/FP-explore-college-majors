1650211,A39650P2CZUUC9,B00CQ8HCSM,"Bonnie Brody ""Book Lover and Knitter""","[12, 14]","This movie starts off with Teresa (Margaret Tiesel) saying goodbye to her daughter who is lying on her bed playing with her cell phone.  It is obvious that her daughter finds Teresa an annoyance.  Their relationship seems fraught with disconnection and Teresa leaves for her vacation in Kenya on that note.  Once in Kenya, Teresa seems enamored of the country and the beautiful weather along with her hotel.  The other women she meets tell her about the men they have been having sex with - young Africans who they meet at the beach or in town.  She sees that one of her new friends has purchased a motorbike for her 'boyfriend' and this surprises Teresa.  Teresa, at first, is totally against finding a lover.  Gradually, she succumbs to the idea and tries to have sex with a man she meets.  She can not go through with it as it seems too perfunctory.This movie examines the morphing of Teresa from a prudish Austrian tourist to a woman who opens up to her sensuality with the young African men she takes to bed.  It also shows her increasing knowledge of the psychological and fiscal cost of these encounters.  Her 'lovers' want money for different things: their sick nephews, their ill fathers, etc.  She realizes at one point that she is being used and lied to and gets furious with the man, berating and even physically battering him.This is a hard movie to watch.  As Teresa becomes aware of the real cost of fulfilling her sexuality, she goes through stages and then partakes of what is expected in this culture of self-fulfillment.  There is much frontal nudity which may be difficult for some people to watch.  There are also many painful emotional scenes that make this movie dark and despairing.  I found that the title hinted at what Teresa hoped for but never did find.  I liked the movie but cringed a lot throughout it.  It is not a movie for everyone.  The plot is not action filled but is slow and filled with a deep nod to Teresa's experiences.  Overall, it is a fine movie that left me emotionally spent.  The movie is originally in German and has sub-titles.",4,Paradise Lost,1377475200,"08 26, 2013",2013,2078,"['movie', 'Teresa', 'Margaret', 'Tiesel', 'saying', 'goodbye', 'daughter', 'who', 'lying', 'bed', 'playing', 'cell', 'phone', 'obvious', 'daughter', 'Teresa', 'annoyance', 'relationship', 'fraught', 'disconnection', 'Teresa', 'vacation', 'Kenya', 'note', 'Once', 'Kenya', 'Teresa', 'enamored', 'country', 'beautiful', 'weather', 'hotel', 'other', 'women', 'tell', 'men', 'have', 'been', 'having', 'sex', 'young', 'Africans', 'who', 'meet', 'beach', 'town', 'one', 'new', 'friends', 'purchased', 'motorbike', ""'boyfriend"", 'Teresa', 'Teresa', 'first', 'totally', 'finding', 'lover', 'Gradually', 'succumbs', 'idea', 'tries', 'have', 'sex', 'man', 'can', 'not', 'go', 'too', 'perfunctory.This', 'movie', 'morphing', 'Teresa', 'prudish', 'Austrian', 'tourist', 'woman', 'who', 'up', 'sensuality', 'young', 'African', 'men', 'bed', 'also', 'increasing', 'knowledge', 'psychological', 'fiscal', 'cost', 'encounters', ""'lovers"", 'want', 'money', 'different', 'things', 'sick', 'nephews', 'ill', 'fathers', 'etc', 'one', 'point', 'being', 'used', 'lied', 'furious', 'man', 'berating', 'even', 'physically', 'battering', 'him.This', 'hard', 'movie', 'watch', 'Teresa', 'aware', 'real', 'cost', 'fulfilling', 'sexuality', 'stages', 'then', 'partakes', 'what', 'expected', 'culture', 'self-fulfillment', 'much', 'frontal', 'nudity', 'may', 'be', 'difficult', 'people', 'watch', 'are', 'also', 'many', 'painful', 'emotional', 'scenes', 'make', 'movie', 'dark', 'despairing', 'found', 'title', 'hinted', 'what', 'Teresa', 'hoped', 'never', 'did', 'find', 'liked', 'movie', 'cringed', 'lot', 'not', 'movie', 'everyone', 'plot', 'not', 'action', 'filled', 'slow', 'filled', 'deep', 'nod', 'Teresa', 'experiences', 'Overall', 'fine', 'movie', 'left', 'emotionally', 'spent', 'movie', 'originally', 'German', 'sub-titles']",Paradise: Love

The cinematography is superb, the atmosphere makes you feel as if you are on vacation as well, and the dialogues feel like real conversations that are both shallow and meaningful at the same time. Sure, it is slow, but it is such a realistic film that I did not want it to end.Teresa is an Austrian, middle-aged woman who goes to a resort in Kenya to spend a vacation. There she meets other Austrian women like her: unfit, with low self-esteem and hungry for love. Teresa starts meeting local men who ""love"" her for who she really is, and this is when we really start knowing everybody for who they really are.At times funny, at times sad, this film makes you ponder about the emotional poverty of some people and the economic poverty of some other. When both of these kinds of poverties meet, rather than complement each other, they leave you feeling more void and poor of what you thought you originally were.This movie has been compared to ""Heading South"", but while both films are about sex tourism (""Heading South"" is set in Haiti), their plots are different.

1650217,A206QWS6B8A2F0,B00CQ8HCSM,"JACK ""Listening and Reading""","[2, 3]","Paradise: Love chronicles tragi-comic escapades of Teresa, a lonely single mother's vacation in Kenya (I believe) leaving behind an indifferent teenage daughter in her native Austria.As I watched the action unfold, I wasn't sure what was going on:  Is it a scripted movie or is it a candid documentary? Regardless of its genre, Paradise: Love depicts Teresa's slow, faltering metamorphosis from a woman who fought off the sexual advances of an ardent young African man to her final transformation as a clumsy unsuccessful seducer of yet another African young man. Teresa is goaded into her sexual exploits by three fellow randy, giddy Austrian women who appear as old hands in their  objectification of poor African boys on the make much in the same way middle-aged men objectify willing young women. Poor Teresa, however, gets the formula wrong as she quizzes one of her suitors-for-hire about his &#34;love&#34; for her. As I watched Teresa, grinning from ear to ear, desperate to appear pleasant, shambling down one dark street after the other alone or in the company of some man she'd met only minutes ago, I anticipated her being mugged, raped, or flat-out disappearing; her corpse washing up on the shore some weeks later. Thankfully, none of my grim imaginings came to pass.The ending was most poignant and telling:  Teresa's lone plump silhouette trudging along in the sands while a gaggle of young male figures turn somersaults in the opposite direction.The pursuit of &#34;love.&#34; Very much, unfortunately, like life.",4,Paradise Definitely Lost,1388188800,"12 28, 2013",2013,1530,"['Paradise', 'Love', 'chronicles', 'tragi-comic', 'escapades', 'Teresa', 'lonely', 'single', 'mother', 'vacation', 'Kenya', 'believe', 'leaving', 'indifferent', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'native', 'Austria.As', 'watched', 'action', 'unfold', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'scripted', 'movie', 'candid', 'documentary', 'Regardless', 'genre', 'Paradise', 'Love', 'Teresa', 'slow', 'faltering', 'metamorphosis', 'woman', 'who', 'fought', 'off', 'sexual', 'advances', 'ardent', 'young', 'African', 'man', 'final', 'transformation', 'clumsy', 'unsuccessful', 'seducer', 'yet', 'African', 'young', 'man', 'Teresa', 'goaded', 'sexual', 'exploits', 'three', 'fellow', 'randy', 'giddy', 'Austrian', 'women', 'who', 'appear', 'old', 'hands', 'objectification', 'poor', 'African', 'boys', 'make', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'middle-aged', 'men', 'willing', 'young', 'women', 'Poor', 'Teresa', 'however', 'formula', 'wrong', 'one', 'suitors-for-hire', '34', 'love', '34', 'watched', 'Teresa', 'grinning', 'ear', 'ear', 'desperate', 'appear', 'pleasant', 'shambling', 'down', 'one', 'dark', 'street', 'other', 'alone', 'company', 'man', ""'d"", 'met', 'only', 'minutes', 'ago', 'anticipated', 'being', 'mugged', 'raped', 'flat-out', 'disappearing', 'corpse', 'washing', 'up', 'shore', 'weeks', 'later', 'Thankfully', 'none', 'grim', 'imaginings', 'came', 'pass.The', 'ending', 'was', 'most', 'poignant', 'telling', 'Teresa', 'lone', 'plump', 'silhouette', 'trudging', 'along', 'sands', 'gaggle', 'young', 'male', 'figures', 'turn', 'somersaults', 'opposite', 'direction.The', 'pursuit', '34', '34', 'Very', 'much', 'unfortunately', 'life']",Paradise: Love
1650218,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00CQ8HCSM,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[16, 18]","To be perfectly blunt, Austrian filmmaker Ulrich Seidl's ""Paradise: Love"" displays three seemingly incongruous qualities simultaneously.  It is strangely hopeful, unrepentantly bleak, AND darkly humorous.  All of these attributes make it painfully realistic as well.  And it is this realness, this unwavering look at some of the seamier elements of aging and sexuality that might scare away more mainstream viewers.  I can't say that I enjoyed the movie in a traditional sense, but it certainly made a visceral impact.  The first in a proposed trilogy (with Paradise: Faith and Paradise: Hope), the trio of films follow three female members of the same family as they travel on separate excursions.  In ""Paradise: Love"" matriarch Teresa (a fearless Margarete Tiesel) travels to a resort in Kenya for what initially appears to be relaxation and sight-seeing.  What quickly becomes apparent, however, is that she actually seeks something of a more intimate nature.  The middle-aged women who partake of the luxuries of this establishment use the opportunity to seek out young sexual partners from the local population.""Paradise: Love"" is Teresa's quest.  At first, she is merely curious, intrigued and somewhat excited about the adventures her friends have experienced.  She seems reticent to move forward, but succumbs to the advances of the first young man who catches her fancy.  The brusque and business-like transaction doesn't appeal to Teresa who needs the illusion of love and intimacy as opposed to just physical contact.  When she meets a young man who seems to understand her and like her, she gives herself to the experience.  Is she naive to think bliss and happiness, however fleeting, are in the cards?  Of course, these lonely white women from around the globe fuel much of the local economy so it costs to play in this realm.  That is something that Teresa will have to come to terms with in a series of increasingly uncomfortable situations.  The movie is really about the evolution of Teresa as the unpleasant realities of this world don't jibe with the romanticized notion she had of this vacation.  Laid bare (literally and symbolically), Teresa is soon stripped of any illusions.""Paradise: Love,"" by design, is not a film that will appeal to all audiences.  It's a small movie with little plot, just a series of random encounters.  It is filled with overt and sometimes unpleasant sexuality.  If you shy away from explicitness or nudity, this is not the film for you.  There is frequent full frontal nudity (male and female) and some of the sequences (the stripper, for example) push the boundaries of what you might have seen dramatized in other films.  This is occasionally shocking, and always in your face with its frankness.  What is depicted is neither paradise, nor love, and so the title feels deeply ironic.  But led by a great Margarete Tiesel, we see into the soul of our protagonist.  It is bold and uncompromising.  As we so rarely see those of an advanced age sexualized, it brought to mind the wonderful British film ""The Mother"" (with an absolutely fantastic Anne Reid and Daniel Craig).  Once again, ""Paradise: Love"" is not lightweight or frothy entertainment.  It has the power to provoke and disturb.  That is both its greatest strength and what will turn some people off.

1650220,AOVU5A9GVXHFT,B00CQ8HCSM,Margaret Opine,"[1, 1]","ULRICH SEIDL'S WORK is the kind of film I'll drive miles to see and spend lots of time thinking about what the &#34;artist&#34; hoped to share with me, tell me, teach me and I have to decide if it is just voyerism or pornography or someone trying to produce something provocative and failed.  I'll begin by saying ''PARADISE HOPE''  is a given--young girl behaving dumb because she is a young girl but psychiatrists will say she is behaving that way because her father is not in the picture: she and her mother are like: &#34;girls gone wild&#34;.  (How come I understand that?)The only thing provocative about this part of the triology is the last scenes in the forest when the man from the tavern took her there and laid her down.  I held my breathe and said, &#34;Dumb man all the way through that.&#34;  But then, that was &#34;MAN'S&#34; time to shine or falter in Seidl's lense and MAN does falter like in all the other segments of this triology with the lense on women.  THAT'S what Seidl's work does.  You can't glass it over.  When we (the voyeurs) are forced to see stuff that is not meant for us to see, stuff we call personal, what he is saying and what he is showing is what we are doing on a daily basis when we think no one (who knows us) is watching.  We do things we don't want to get out.ANOTHER SEGMENT OF THE TRIOLOGY is: &#34;PARADISE-FAITH&#34;...What is a woman to do when she has everything she needs at forty and her husband is not around for two years.  Well, her big house is immaculate.  That means it is time to get up and go out in the community, in the world, and find something else to do.  Then... there is the bright idea to change religious faith and become swept away with divine zeal.  And in doing so, get so caught up in it that she falls in love with Jesus in more than one way.  She loves him so that she wishes he could be her MAN in all ways.  But, not in the dirty ways, of course, so she takes a hot bath and scrubs herself to make sure she has all the ''natural'' dirt off of her.  She will be with Jesus on a &#34;pure&#34; and &#34;perfect&#34; level that defies natural proclivities.  I've seen this behavior, have read about it, and history has lots of stories and tales and legends to inform anyone who is interested.  It appears to be a syndrome that is much like the syndrome that women go into to prostitute on their own BUT this is the opposite of that pathology.  It's like the prostitute gives up hope and drive and decides to stay down-low and the zealot raises hope and drive and determination to go up high and live with Jesus very personally.  That can  end up being pathological too.  So, what is Seidl saying about women, all women in this triology-----ARE ALL WOMEN CAPABLE OF WHAT HE DISPLAYS?  IF NOT EXACTLY, BUT SOMETHING NEARLY LIKE IT???  Well.  That's something you would have to talk about and discuss.  That's something you would have to decide and change your mind back and forth about...but you won't forget what you saw in Seidl's Triology.  Saying its disgusting work, amaturish work, won't end the battle in your mind as to why it does appear as if he is glorifying broken, sad people but then you begin to see broken sad people all around you and wonder if you're not broken and sad too.  AND I SAY WE ALL ARE....(at times)&#34;PARADISE: LOVE&#34; was pushed squarely in my face and I had to acknowledge it.  Because when I find myself in movies or books, music and art, and even law, I embrace  the parts of my being thinking I will be able to integrate the parts and know them all as ME.  And I tell you that Margarethe Tiesel brought that home to me.  Her performance was off the chart.  She made it all so real, not ideal at all.  It was raw, in your face REAL.  Her need(s) is real; her need is real in all women???(That's a question.)  But I'm not likely to go to a foreign country myself and follow strangers like that.  But... have I done 'Vacation Love'?  Welll yes....there was this symphony conductor under the New England moonlight....PARADISE LOVE is hard to take for most people.  So many things are going on at once.  Everything we see jars our sense of reality.  Especially the reality we call: MORALS!  Two ''worlds'' meet, WE LIKE TO THINK: one black, one white and yet they come together in a direct raw way with ''new rules'', NEW MORALS.  And the new rules say: &#34;I'm in business and you're a customer.  You have need of me and that is obvious to everyone; depend on me; trust me; I will take care of you like you want and need to be taken care of.  I promise.  I will do my best to make you happy with my service but at the end of the day I want you to give me money.  I want you to give my family money because I serviced your need for love and attention.  I am working.  I am earning money for my family. My wife is very angry that I do this but she does not turn down the money you give her.  I will do what you want but I do have my limits.  There are some things I will not do even for money.&#34;''Teresa'' cries at the end.  WHY DOES Teresa cry?  Ask women everywhere: Why is Teresa crying and I say it has nothing to do with the people who provided services for her: I think its because it is her birthday and she has not gotten a call from the one person she thought would call her and send her love---HOME did not call her; she called home and begged home to call but home did not call.  I THINK A LOT OF WOMEN KNOW WHAT THAT FEELS LIKE--I THINK ALL WOMEN KNOW WHAT THAT FEELS LIKE  and that WILL break you down and make you cry.  It does feel like: NOBODY LOVES ME, NOBODY CARES...but that is usually and most likely not true.  Such is the &#34;creature condition&#34; in the natural body...so then we break down and have a good cry.THANK YOU ULRICH SEIDL...I don't know if you intended this kind of depth and perspective--maybe

1650222,A39IY0JU5JI69G,B00CQ8HCSM,"Promise ""promise""","[3, 3]","At this point, &#34;very interesting&#34; is all I can come up with.  Perhaps later I'll be able to be more articulate.I'll try---first off, the lead actress is amazing!  Not only her fearlessness in showing her body but also in showing the full range of her emotions.  Mostly, what she impressed me with was her innocence.  The other Austrian tourists she met were more or less jaded in their expectations of getting sex for money from these African young men.  This woman, our heroine, was actually looking for love.  It amazed me how many times she tried, again and again, to find love with these fellows who were clearly doing what they were doing for money.  I was also amazed at her naive, but genuine sweetness, as when she met the young &#34;sister&#34; of her first lover and the school children.  I also have to give her credit for her dancing...she managed some great moves, there.What emerged for me, was a picture of a genuinely sweet, but muddled middle class, middle-aged Austrian woman, who could have been any woman from any Western country, as she looked for love.  The opening scene shows her at her job which is as a teacher of developmentally disabled adults.  She clearly has a big heart.  She's not married, her teenage daughter would rather talk on the phone than to her, there is no man in sight, she is rather obsessive about cleanliness.  She thinks she is old and fat but she'd really like to believe that she is still desirable.  It's all so terribly typical of a lot of women....maybe men, too.Besides the bald picture of the game of prostitution and mutual exploitation, there is this unexpected beauty that the film shows.  The beach at Kenya is gorgeous although studded with men waiting to sell themselves to the female tourists.  What struck me was the unexpected beauty of the tiny homes of the African men....especially that of &#34;Mumba,&#34; her first &#34;boyfriend,&#34;  His room, although very humble was quite beautiful.  I loved the prints of the fabrics, the colors of the walls, the sheer lavender net that fell over the bed/  Was this for mosquitoes?  Maybe...but when he unfolded it and she lay in it, the scene was quite beautiful. Rodin would have loved her! The scene of Mumba, stretched out, nude, on the bed, was quite splendid, too.  She recorded this with her cell phone which was terrible funny and just, terrible,  But at the same time, he was so beautiful, that you couldn't blame her.I think it is this position of the film maker -- of objectivity---non-judgement as he showed what the poor Black African men did and what the middle class White Austrian women did that give this film it's value.  He doesn't spare us any of the details but even the most bald nude scenes are shown with such honesty that I found it all quite amazing.  Obviously every viewer will see this differently, some with moral judgment, some with shock, some with sociological tsk-tsk-ing.  For me, it's just quite amazing. I am reminded of a line from a Tennessee Williams play, that &#34;nothing human is disgusting.&#34;  I look forward to seeing the rest of this film maker's Paradise trilogy.",4,Very interesting....,1388361600,"12 30, 2013",2013,3132,"['point', '34', 'very', 'interesting', '34', 'can', 'come', 'up', 'Perhaps', 'later', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'be', 'more', 'articulate.I', ""'ll"", 'try', '-first', 'off', 'lead', 'actress', 'amazing', 'Not', 'only', 'fearlessness', 'showing', 'body', 'also', 'showing', 'full', 'range', 'emotions', 'Mostly', 'what', 'impressed', 'was', 'innocence', 'other', 'Austrian', 'tourists', 'met', 'were', 'more', 'less', 'jaded', 'expectations', 'getting', 'sex', 'money', 'African', 'young', 'men', 'woman', 'heroine', 'was', 'actually', 'looking', 'love', 'amazed', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'tried', 'again', 'again', 'find', 'love', 'fellows', 'who', 'were', 'clearly', 'doing', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'money', 'was', 'also', 'amazed', 'naive', 'genuine', 'sweetness', 'when', 'met', 'young', '34', 'sister', '34', 'first', 'lover', 'school', 'children', 'also', 'have', 'give', 'credit', 'dancing', 'managed', 'great', 'moves', 'emerged', 'was', 'picture', 'genuinely', 'sweet', 'muddled', 'middle', 'class', 'middle-aged', 'Austrian', 'woman', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'woman', 'Western', 'country', 'looked', 'love', 'opening', 'scene', 'job', 'teacher', 'developmentally', 'disabled', 'adults', 'clearly', 'big', 'heart', 'not', 'married', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'would', 'rather', 'talk', 'phone', 'man', 'sight', 'rather', 'obsessive', 'cleanliness', 'old', 'fat', ""'d"", 'really', 'like', 'believe', 'still', 'desirable', 'so', 'terribly', 'typical', 'lot', 'women', '.maybe', 'men', 'bald', 'picture', 'game', 'prostitution', 'mutual', 'exploitation', 'unexpected', 'beauty', 'film', 'shows', 'beach', 'Kenya', 'gorgeous', 'studded', 'men', 'waiting', 'sell', 'female', 'tourists', 'What', 'struck', 'was', 'unexpected', 'beauty', 'tiny', 'homes', 'African', 'men', '.especially', '34', 'Mumba', '34', 'first', '34', 'boyfriend', '34', 'room', 'very', 'humble', 'was', 'quite', 'beautiful', 'loved', 'prints', 'fabrics', 'colors', 'walls', 'sheer', 'lavender', 'net', 'fell', 'bed/', 'Was', 'mosquitoes', 'Maybe', 'when', 'unfolded', 'lay', 'scene', 'was', 'quite', 'beautiful', 'Rodin', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'scene', 'Mumba', 'stretched', 'out', 'nude', 'bed', 'was', 'quite', 'splendid', 'too', 'recorded', 'cell', 'phone', 'was', 'terrible', 'funny', 'just', 'terrible', 'same', 'time', 'was', 'so', 'beautiful', 'could', ""n't"", 'blame', 'her.I', 'think', 'position', 'film', 'maker', 'objectivity', '-non-judgement', 'showed', 'what', 'poor', 'Black', 'African', 'men', 'did', 'what', 'middle', 'class', 'White', 'Austrian', 'women', 'did', 'give', 'film', 'value', ""n't"", 'spare', 'details', 'even', 'most', 'bald', 'nude', 'scenes', 'are', 'shown', 'such', 'honesty', 'found', 'quite', 'amazing', 'Obviously', 'viewer', 'will', 'see', 'differently', 'moral', 'judgment', 'shock', 'sociological', 'tsk-tsk-ing', 'just', 'quite', 'amazing', 'am', 'reminded', 'line', 'Tennessee', 'Williams', 'play', '34', 'nothing', 'human', 'disgusting.', '34', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'rest', 'film', 'maker', 'Paradise', 'trilogy']",Paradise: Love
