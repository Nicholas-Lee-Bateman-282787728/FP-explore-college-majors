She is contrasted with her brother Paul, who is weak and afraid of life's risks, while she is strong, independent, and willful; he goes on to success while she achieves nothing but madness. Rodin uses her, emotionally and physically, and when she becomes pregnant by him and wants him to marry her, he refuses (he's actually living with another woman). She has an abortion, attempts again to get Rodin to marry her, fails at this - and then slips into the madness of paranoia. She continues to sculpt, has one showing, but it's not a success and she goes off the deep end. She spends the last 30 years of her life in an asylum. The movie is good, mainly because the script is excellent; so is the period photography. At times it goes soft, though, especially in some of the scenes with Rodin (played well by Gerard Depardieu) where a knockout punches should have been delivered.

There are so many heated issues lurking here.  How many women artists, like Claudel, were exploited by the only &quot;acceptable&quot; artists of prior centuries, namely men?  For Rodin clearly steals from Claudel and no one even disputes it.  Next, what drove Claudel to madness and did her edge-of-breakdown personality work for her in her art work? It is quite possible that &quot;made&quot; her art more than any other factor.  No one will ever know.  Third, what would the effects of modern modern medicine have on Claudel if she were an artist among us now?  Would she still go mad or would modern drugs save her?  Would she even take modern drugs since many of today's artists will not take them, believing they will be robbed of their creativity.  Finally, what did she really look like because no one could possibly look as good as Isabelle Adjani who plays her, right?  I looked at her photos on the web and suprisingly found her to be an equally gorgeous woman when in her prime.

565948,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B000053VBM,C. B Collins Jr.,"[2, 2]","Camille Claudel was the young talented studio assistant to Auguste Rodin who became his muse and lover at a point in his career when he was a commercial success but had become devoid of inspiration. When he refused to leave his common-law wife of many years to marry Camille, she had an abortion and then gradually sunk into paranoid schizophrenia. This is the basic story. However the subtle manner in which the story is told and the unresolved issues in the life of Claudel elevate the film into a work of art.The film explores the artistic muse and their relationship with the artist.  Camille was a muse in that her images were fresh and vibrant which inspired Rodin. She was also a willful and socially disruptive iconoclastic young women and Rodin is attracted to her outbursts of emotion. He is twice her age and becomes her lover even though he has a common-law wife that he has no intention of leaving. Their collaborations on his sculptures inspired some of his best work. Yet her father wisely knew that she was losing herself in Rodin, putting her inspiration into his products, elevating his career and not her own. It is the nature of the artist to draw from all experiences and resources around him/her for the benefit of their art.  Picasso's paintings when he is in love and inspired by a woman are very different from when he is rejecting the woman and he paints her as a monster. The relationship between Rodin and Claudel somewhat reminded me of the relationship between Francis Bacon and George Dyer in the film, Love is the Devil.  Once Dyer reached the point where he no longer inspired Bacon and was in fact a liability due to alcoholism and addiction and mental illness, then Bacon withdraws in much the way Rodin withdraws from Claudel as she becomes increasingly disturbed.The film is very beautiful to watch. The scenes of Paris and the countryside around the city, as well as the museums and exhibition halls in Paris are very beautiful and grand. The acting is superb with Isabelle Adjani and Gerard Depardieu dominating every scene. Adjani has the ability to play highly disturbed women to perfection. She is in virtually every scene in the film. It is virtually impossible not to watch her when she is on the screen.",4,A tragic fall for a talented young artist,1226620800,"11 14, 2008",2008,2248,"['Camille', 'Claudel', 'was', 'young', 'talented', 'studio', 'assistant', 'Auguste', 'Rodin', 'who', 'became', 'muse', 'lover', 'point', 'career', 'when', 'was', 'commercial', 'success', 'had', 'become', 'devoid', 'inspiration', 'When', 'refused', 'leave', 'common-law', 'wife', 'many', 'years', 'marry', 'Camille', 'had', 'abortion', 'then', 'gradually', 'sunk', 'paranoid', 'schizophrenia', 'basic', 'story', 'However', 'subtle', 'manner', 'story', 'told', 'unresolved', 'issues', 'life', 'Claudel', 'elevate', 'film', 'work', 'art.The', 'film', 'artistic', 'muse', 'relationship', 'artist', 'Camille', 'was', 'muse', 'images', 'were', 'fresh', 'vibrant', 'inspired', 'Rodin', 'was', 'also', 'willful', 'socially', 'disruptive', 'iconoclastic', 'young', 'women', 'Rodin', 'attracted', 'outbursts', 'emotion', 'twice', 'age', 'lover', 'even', 'common-law', 'wife', 'intention', 'leaving', 'collaborations', 'sculptures', 'inspired', 'best', 'work', 'father', 'wisely', 'knew', 'was', 'losing', 'Rodin', 'putting', 'inspiration', 'products', 'elevating', 'career', 'not', 'own', 'nature', 'artist', 'draw', 'experiences', 'resources', 'around', 'him/her', 'benefit', 'art', 'Picasso', 'paintings', 'when', 'love', 'inspired', 'woman', 'are', 'very', 'different', 'when', 'rejecting', 'woman', 'monster', 'relationship', 'Rodin', 'Claudel', 'somewhat', 'reminded', 'relationship', 'Francis', 'Bacon', 'George', 'Dyer', 'film', 'Love', 'Devil', 'Once', 'Dyer', 'reached', 'point', 'where', 'no', 'longer', 'inspired', 'Bacon', 'was', 'fact', 'liability', 'due', 'alcoholism', 'addiction', 'mental', 'illness', 'then', 'Bacon', 'much', 'way', 'Rodin', 'withdraws', 'Claudel', 'increasingly', 'disturbed.The', 'film', 'very', 'beautiful', 'watch', 'scenes', 'Paris', 'countryside', 'city', 'as', 'well', 'museums', 'exhibition', 'halls', 'Paris', 'are', 'very', 'beautiful', 'grand', 'acting', 'superb', 'Isabelle', 'Adjani', 'Gerard', 'Depardieu', 'dominating', 'scene', 'Adjani', 'ability', 'play', 'highly', 'disturbed', 'women', 'perfection', 'virtually', 'scene', 'film', 'virtually', 'impossible', 'not', 'watch', 'when', 'screen']",N/A

565951,A1G56KHOUOFWDW,B000053VBM,"Dianne Foster ""Di""","[79, 85]","A few years ago, on a beautiful sunny March day, I visited the house and grounds of the Rodin museum, formerly the home of Auguste Rodin.  The museum sits very near a hospital Napoleon commissioned and is in a central tourist area, but it was not overrun with tourists the day I visited.The weather was so nice, I decided to have lunch in the pavillion on the grounds and eventually spent half a day wondering around the various scuptures situated indoors and outside. The 'Thinker' sat contemplating a nearby bush while a little bird landed on his shoulder, and Balzac looked down in triump from his pedestal. But, inside the house, I found a little room dedicated to the work of Camille Claudel, and here I paused the longest. It struck me then that while Rodin dealt with the external, Claudel dealt with the internal--the soul. I'm a small fan of sculpture, but the marble pieces Claudel worked with her hands are amazing. &quot;Life-like&quot; does not say enough. One piece, a marble bust of a child's head and shoulders took my breath away.  I kept waiting for the child to breathe.  I checked to see if she was breathing.  The only pieces I have seen that are comparable were executed by Micheangelo.The film CAMILLE CLAUDEL is worthy of the heroine and her sad story. Rodin treated her badly, if for no other reason than he had no right to become sexually involved with her when she was his employee and he was a married man. Today he would be locked up for sexual harrassment, and Claudel would not spend most of her life locked up because she became &quot;hysterical&quot; after he dumped her.But, Rodin's greatest sin may have been that he became involved with Claudel because he recognized her genius and he wanted to exploit it. Although Rodin certainly had some interesting ideas, which he managed to execute in a prolific way (the Rodin house shows a continuous and ridiculous film of Rodin &quot;creating&quot; a sculpture), I don't think he was terribly innovative. In fact, if the &quot;Thinker&quot; had not been made into book ends, most people would probably not know who Rodin was.Isabel Adjani plays Claudel. She is perfectly cast as Camille, and her performance is as stunning as it was in Queen Margo.  Adjani is one of France's best living actresses--in fact, I think she is the best. Gerhard Depardieu plays Rodin, and he well cast as the large, beefy, inarticulate, egocentric artist.  In fact, he looks exactly like the man in the little film I saw in Paris, just as Adjani looks like the Claudel from her portraits.The film was shot in Paris, and much of the footage taken at the Rodin museum, a Chateau constructed by a 18th Century Aristocrat who died at the hands of Madame Guilliotine.

She gets support from her Father early on in her passionate pursuit of her artistic development however he eventually climbs on the side of her despicable Mother who looks for Camille to take a more traditional path in life (wife, mother, etc).Rodin, considered by many to be one of the world's greatest sculptors, took on Camille as a mentee and quickly learned that in many ways her talents exceeded his.  Rodin, twice her age, falls in love with Claudel and she with him.  Claudel presses Rodin to marry her after learning that she is pregnant however Rodin refuses to commit to her or to any woman for that matter.  Claudel reluctantly walks away from him and eventually loses her mind when she sees that Rodin goes on surviving without her.  She becomes convinced that Rodin and his supporters were out to steal her work and her best ideas and she eventually is institutionalized for 30 years until her death at 78 years of age.I found the story to be engaging and the cinematography to be first rate.

I do not think he was successful other than letting me know it is extremely messy, models must always be freezing, takes a lifetime to perfect, and lots of mushing translates to a lifesize sensous naked piece of marble.  Tall order to show more I imagine, but I keep thinking Picasso and Michaelangelo, albeit easier to demo.  Unfortunately, I have such a limited background in art that I was expecting to really see the process.  I got a glimpse into that secret world which I imagine earns the respect of all true artists.  When Rodin insults the photographer I was saddened as that about measures the depth of my creative talent.  However, Adjani is truly the centerpiece of creation in this film, I recommend a film on her 'creating' Camille, it was incredible....  I was surprised that the only piece delicately depicted in the film was the beautiful Giganti foot and then maybe his face. Otherwise the rest of the imitations, one would think close to the originals, were absolutely course, unfinished and unimpressive.  I think of the Pride and Prejudice scene at first sight of Mr. Darcy's sculpture collection.....breathtaking!!!  Gerald was perfectly suited much like Alfred in Freida.  It is incomprehensible that this woman had sooo much influence in her family to make them move to Paris, stop going to church, inflict such shame and horror, and she never seems to regret anything but working for Rodin.  The backdrop of late 19th century was a special treat and a bucolic life at Villanueve delightful.

Such was her genius, though, that she was accepted as Rodin's student. He supported her career, both as his assitant and as an artist in her own right. Some people say that her skill outstripped even his.Why, then, is her work so little known today? Certainly not because it's appeal faded with  time. It still has all the power to move a viewer that it ever did. The reason is probably that there was so very little of her work, and even less extant today. Her career lasted only a few of her adult years. Illness of mind drove her from the people and venues that supported her, and drove her to destroy much of her own work. In the end, illness left her unable even to care for herself. She was hospitalized in 1913, and died in 1943 without regaining her sanity, her freedom, or her career.This lovely movie documents her life up to 1913. It shows her early promise, her rise to success, and her collapse into incapacity. The basic historical facts, to the best of my knowledge, are sound, but may have been stretched in a few places. Her relationship with Rodin is shown, but may not have been given the emphasis it warranted. Her removal to the hospital for the insane is shown, too, but may not have been the peaceable affair displayed here. No matter.

Unfortunately, she struggled with mental illness and lived in times that did not understand women who wanted to do more than be housewives.  After her romance with Rodin ended, she struggled to pay her bills and keep her sanity.  Eventually, her erratic behavior became too much for her family to bear and they shut her away in mental institutions where she spent the last 30 years of her life.  Reports are mixed about her time in the mental hospital - some say the doctors asked her family to release her while reports of personal nurses say she suffered from paranoid delusions and would not have been able to live outside of the hospital.

That is basially, in a nutshell, the only real problem I had with the movie; it resorts to cliche and tries to tell us that she was crazy, when all she wanted was to be loved by her husband, the artist Rodin (Gerard Depardieu).
