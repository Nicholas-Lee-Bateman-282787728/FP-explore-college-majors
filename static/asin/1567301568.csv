184696,ARFA31P6NNWUR,1567301568,"""5u5hi""","[9, 18]","This film was really quite good, but there were a few things that made this film far from perfect.  While the content and message of the film was powerful, I didn't really feel comfortable with the lesbianism that took place between Rhada and Sita.  Their physical exchange didn't seem authentic.  They seemed to turn to each other because they longed for touch, a touch that might have been satisfied if their husbands had truly cared for them both emotionally and physically.  Furthermore, I didn't like how the film seemed to portray lesbianism as the outcome of two women caring for each other. This is not always the case.  Female friendship doesn't have an inherent element of lesbianism.  In addition, I didn't particularly care for the cinematography.  I found it to be a bit static, and unpoetic, whatever that means.On the other hand, this movie was very powerful due to the idea that women can imagine something different for themselves, despite traditional structures that are oppressive, and despite what some might consider the insidious influences of patriarchy.  This is why the film constantly returns to Rhada's attempt to envisage the ocean.  So long as she can't imagine the ocean, she can't imagine a situation different for herself.  The most powerful scene in this film was when Rhada declared that she &quot;desires to live.&quot;  Similarly, Sita seems to imagine something different for herself when she dresses in Jhatin's clothes.  Wearing his clothes seem to empower her in a way that wearing her sari does not.While some might tout this end of this film as a triumph for Western values, I really think this film took the approach of Third World feminism, that there are other ways to create a woman friendly situation.",3,3 1/2 Stars,1064793600,"09 29, 2003",2003,1748,"['film', 'was', 'really', 'quite', 'good', 'were', 'few', 'things', 'made', 'film', 'far', 'perfect', 'content', 'message', 'film', 'was', 'powerful', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'feel', 'comfortable', 'lesbianism', 'took', 'place', 'Rhada', 'Sita', 'Their', 'physical', 'exchange', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'authentic', 'seemed', 'turn', 'other', 'longed', 'touch', 'touch', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'satisfied', 'husbands', 'had', 'truly', 'cared', 'emotionally', 'physically', 'Furthermore', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'how', 'film', 'seemed', 'portray', 'lesbianism', 'outcome', 'two', 'women', 'caring', 'other', 'not', 'always', 'case', 'Female', 'friendship', ""n't"", 'have', 'inherent', 'element', 'lesbianism', 'addition', 'did', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'care', 'cinematography', 'found', 'be', 'bit', 'static', 'unpoetic', 'means.On', 'other', 'hand', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'powerful', 'due', 'idea', 'women', 'can', 'imagine', 'something', 'different', 'traditional', 'structures', 'are', 'oppressive', 'what', 'might', 'consider', 'insidious', 'influences', 'patriarchy', 'why', 'film', 'constantly', 'Rhada', 'attempt', 'envisage', 'ocean', 'So', 'long', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'ocean', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'situation', 'different', 'herself', 'most', 'powerful', 'scene', 'film', 'was', 'when', 'Rhada', 'declared', 'quot', 'live.', 'quot', 'Similarly', 'Sita', 'imagine', 'something', 'different', 'herself', 'when', 'Jhatin', 'clothes', 'Wearing', 'clothes', 'seem', 'empower', 'way', 'wearing', 'sari', 'might', 'tout', 'end', 'film', 'triumph', 'Western', 'values', 'really', 'think', 'film', 'took', 'approach', 'Third', 'World', 'feminism', 'are', 'other', 'ways', 'create', 'woman', 'friendly', 'situation']",Fire VHS

184699,ATDE9JYCPI0L1,1567301568,Alyssa A. Lappen,"[4, 5]","I saw this film on the same evening as I watched Deepa Metha's Earth. This film features many of the same actors but exposes a radically different topic--personal freedom and sexuality within the confines of a traditional Hindi family. But I found the first film more compelling and believable, somehow.The film opens as Sita (Nandita Das) visits the Taj Mahal with her new bridegroom, Jatin (Javed Jaffrey), who seems surprisingly standoffish, considering the circumstances. ""We've only been married three days,"" he tells Sita, when she asks if he doesn't like her anymore. Soon after her arrival at his home, she discovers a dysfunctional family, Indian style.Her new brother-in-law Ashok (Kulbhushan Kharbanda) frequently leaves his video and sweets shop to visit the local swamee, who gave him a new spiritual lease on life after he learned that his wife Radha (Shabana Azmi) could not bear children. They seem oddly distant, too, although in due course, viewers learn that Ashok vowed to become a celibate shortly after his wife's barren condition--""no eggs, madame""--was diagnosed. Jatin, it shortly turns out, is obsessed with a longtime Chinese girlfriend, despite her rejection of his marriage proposal. Audaciously, he even recommends that Sita meet her.To cap off this odd bunch is Mundu (Ranjit Chowdhry), a sweet shop employee who often ducks upstairs when no one is around to watch pornographic movies and jerk off. It doesn't bother him at all that Ashok's ancient, bed-ridden ailing mother Biji (Kushal Rekhi) spends most of her time in the TV room.As others have noted, the inconsiderate men in this family inadvertently cast their wives into a close relationship that soon becomes loving, and eventually, sexual.It's an intriguing film, but I found Earth to be of far more consequence. And from what I hear, Metha's film, Water, is better than either of them.--Alyssa A.

184700,A37PV5GMP2ILJC,1567301568,Amanda Richards,"[115, 119]","This is not your grandmother's old Rishi Kapoor or Hema Malini movie, where kissing was taboo, and romance was limited to making goo-goo eyes and performing elaborately choreographed dances in the mountains.By Hollywood standards, this is an intriguing movie, where two women rebel against their traditional roles, and turn to each other for love, respect and sexual gratification.By Bollywood standards however, this shocker has committed several major offenses, the least of which are the on-screen love scenes between two women.  The issues that shocked the traditionalists to the bone are that firstly, the women are Hindus, secondly the movie challenges the very core of male dominance, and thirdly, that women have the right to be independent and happy in their marital relationships.Radha (Shabana Azmi) is married to Ashok (Kulbhushan Kharbanda) and has been unable to fulfill his desire for a child.  Ashok has been consulting a Swami, and in the belief that desire is the root of all evil, keeps her close to him without intimacy so that he will become a better person.Sita (Nandita Das) is a young bride with a longing for love and adventure, married to Jatin (Javed Jaffrey) who is unwilling to provide her with either, because he is in love with someone else.  Their marriage is a sham, as Jatin only married to please Ashok and his grandmother Biji.As per custom, the whole extended family lives under one roof, and their unhappy marriages draw Sita and Radha together.  Sita turns out to be the one who inspires the break with tradition, and finds a willing convert in Radha.Director Deepa Mehta handles this controversial movie tastefully and tenderly, the romance balanced by traditional family values and the comedic activities of the servant Mundu (Ranjit Chowdhry, a Mehta regular).  Shabana Azmi is perfect as the more mature woman, but Nandita Das sparkles as the enlightened abandoned bride.My only regret is that the DVD version lacks subtitles, as even though the actors all speak English, their accents and Hindi references are sometimes difficult to catch.A beautiful and powerful movie, but not your usual Bollywood fare.Amanda Richards, December 27, 2004",5,Bollywood shocker,1104019200,"12 26, 2004",2004,2183,"['not', 'grandmother', 'old', 'Rishi', 'Kapoor', 'Hema', 'Malini', 'movie', 'where', 'kissing', 'was', 'taboo', 'romance', 'was', 'limited', 'making', 'goo-goo', 'eyes', 'performing', 'elaborately', 'choreographed', 'dances', 'mountains.By', 'Hollywood', 'standards', 'intriguing', 'movie', 'where', 'two', 'women', 'rebel', 'traditional', 'roles', 'turn', 'other', 'love', 'respect', 'sexual', 'gratification.By', 'Bollywood', 'standards', 'however', 'shocker', 'committed', 'several', 'major', 'offenses', 'least', 'are', 'on-screen', 'love', 'scenes', 'two', 'women', 'issues', 'shocked', 'traditionalists', 'bone', 'are', 'firstly', 'women', 'are', 'Hindus', 'secondly', 'movie', 'very', 'core', 'male', 'dominance', 'thirdly', 'women', 'have', 'right', 'be', 'independent', 'happy', 'marital', 'relationships.Radha', 'Shabana', 'Azmi', 'married', 'Ashok', 'Kulbhushan', 'Kharbanda', 'been', 'unable', 'fulfill', 'desire', 'child', 'Ashok', 'been', 'consulting', 'Swami', 'belief', 'desire', 'root', 'evil', 'close', 'intimacy', 'so', 'will', 'become', 'better', 'person.Sita', 'Nandita', 'Das', 'young', 'bride', 'longing', 'love', 'adventure', 'married', 'Jatin', 'Javed', 'Jaffrey', 'who', 'unwilling', 'provide', 'love', 'someone', 'else', 'marriage', 'sham', 'Jatin', 'only', 'married', 'please', 'Ashok', 'grandmother', 'Biji.As', 'custom', 'whole', 'extended', 'family', 'lives', 'one', 'roof', 'unhappy', 'marriages', 'draw', 'Sita', 'Radha', 'together', 'Sita', 'out', 'be', 'one', 'who', 'break', 'tradition', 'willing', 'convert', 'Radha.Director', 'Deepa', 'Mehta', 'controversial', 'movie', 'tastefully', 'tenderly', 'romance', 'balanced', 'traditional', 'family', 'values', 'comedic', 'activities', 'servant', 'Mundu', 'Ranjit', 'Chowdhry', 'Mehta', 'regular', 'Shabana', 'Azmi', 'perfect', 'more', 'mature', 'woman', 'Nandita', 'Das', 'enlightened', 'abandoned', 'only', 'regret', 'DVD', 'version', 'subtitles', 'even', 'actors', 'speak', 'English', 'accents', 'Hindi', 'references', 'are', 'sometimes', 'difficult', 'catch.A', 'beautiful', 'powerful', 'movie', 'not', 'usual', 'Bollywood', 'fare.Amanda', 'Richards', 'December', '27', '2004']",Fire VHS

Ancient Hindu temples depict lesbian lovers;most Hindu sacred texts treat lesbians as equal to gay male and straight couples. ""Fire"" ignited a firestorm of controversy. The debate notwithstanding,it has beautiful music,beautiful leading ladies--and the beauty of India itself. It opens with the Taj Mahal,India's wonder of the world.""Fire"" tells the story of two desperate housewives--Radha and Sita. Radha's husband is beholden to his guru,and renounces marital intimacy due to their infertility (this echoes Gandhi,who renounced marital intimacy with his wife because they consummated their marriage on their wedding night as his father lay dying) Sita's husband prefers his Chinese girlfriend Julie,and married Sita only out of obligation. Radha and Sita eventually find consolation in each other's arms. Like any other modest Bollywood movie,most of the kisses are hidden. When Radha and Sita consummate their passion,they both look fully clothed--and then it happens behind a curtain. Hindu mythology is also important to this movie. Sita is named for Rama's bride,who underwent a trial by fire to prove her chastity. Radha is named for Krishna's ladylove. Krishna and Rama are emanations/avatars of Vishnu,the Hindu god of preservation. The ending is tragic.""Fire"" weaves in the many threads of Indian spirituality.

184704,A141HP4LYPWMSR,1567301568,Brian E. Erland,"[1, 1]","`Fire' (1997) is a powerful, emotional, and inflammatory film about a highly taboo subject in India which is why writer, director, and co-producer Deepa Mehta had the good sense to release it in English instead of Hindi. Not only is this film extremely bothersome to Indian sensibilities because of the central lesbian storyline but even more so because of the negative commentary it levels against such longstanding, honored and ""holy"" traditional institutions such as marriage, religion and some of the possible ulterior motives that may lay behind a husbands personal spiritual practices.It's difficult to determine what a given viewer might find more disturbing about this film; discomfort over a lesbian relationship, the overwhelmingly negative male, Indian stereotypes or possibly the fact that the two women involved in a romantic relationship happen to be named Radha (the consort of the god Krishna) and Sita (the consort of the god Rama). Tying this tale of forbidden lesbian romance to popular personages within the Hindu spiritual tradition maybe going just a little bit too far don't you think?By now you might assume that I didn't like this movie. If you thought that to be the case you would be incorrect, I loved it! Shabana Azmi and Nandita Das are absolutely perfect in the roles of long suffering Radha and the spirited, untamable Sita. Shabana is such a beautiful and amazing actress, in my opinion she can do no wrong and the younger Nandita Das is more than up to the challenge, balancing Shabana's wisdom and disillusionment with equal amounts of youthful rebelliousness and naive expectation.While Shabana and Nandita are unquestionably the stars of the film there are other wonderful performances as well. The two most notable being Kulbhushan Kharbana in the role of Ashok, Radha's aloft, celibate husband and Ranjit Chowdhry as Mundu the household servant.There are so many levels and subtly interwoven themes to this film that tend to be lost or go unnoticed because of the focus placed on the overt lesbian storyline. `Fire' is a deeply insightful, searing social commentary that pushes the viewer into avenues of self analysis that they usually would not wish to travel. 'Fire' is definitely the appropriate name for this amazing film. My highest recommendation!Note: This is the first film in Deepa Mehta's trilogy, followed by 'Earth' (1999) and 'Water' (2006).

184705,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,1567301568,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[0, 4]","There are many plot points which were easy to see coming, which is the fault of the screenplay by Mehta. But the film is far too suffused with politics to approach greatness, even were it better written. It is not as overtly preachy and hammy as Brokeback Mountain, but it does make excuses for its adulterous lesbians, just as the Hollywood film basically makes heroes out of lying lowlife bastards. As example, while Jatin is certainly a fool and cheater, and Sita owes him no allegiance, the same cannot be said of Radha, for Ashok is certainly a devoted and loving husband. If she was not getting what she wanted, it was her right and duty to speak up and demand change, or leave with honor. His response to her barrenness may have been silly and wrong, but it was not accomplished without her complicity. Radha, in this sense, is the villain of the film, for while Jatin is a letch, he is shown as utterly void of depth. Mundu is a slimebag, but an insignificant little bug. But Radha has the ability to think and choose. She does not merely fall into her relationship with Sita, she chooses its deceptions over her first allegiance to her husband. If she wanted out or change, she should have spoken up, for the energy and will she displays in leaving him could have earlier been displayed within her marriage. Thus, she is an agent of the ill that befalls the family, not a victim, the way the nave and forcefully betrothed Sita is.The other aspects of the film are well done, such as the musical soundtrack by A.R. Rahman, and the cinematography by Giles Nuttgens, but nothing that approaches greatness. The DVD, put out by New Yorker Video, has the 108 minute version of the film, and is shown in a 1.85:1 aspect ratio. There is no audio film commentary, but there is a theatrical trailer, cast profiles and production notes, and a documentary on the controversy the film caused in India, which led to its banning. All in all, it shows Indian culture in a very silly and puerile light.That said, the film, aside from its objective artistic flaws, also suffers from an insular take on its culture. To the non-Indian, as example, there are many political points meant for Indian society, alone, that are lost outside that milieu, and without these touchstone hot buttons as references, the film's political relevance fizzles- the best example being Sita's and Radha's names being based upon Hindu goddesses, and Sita being purged by fire- although in the film it is Radha who is purged by fire; a point Indian film critics lash out at, but which seem silly criticisms to foreign ears. Yet, ultimately, what causes Fire to only reach passable mediocrity as a film is the more immanent artistic flaws of screenplay, characterization, and political imposition. It is a film that is solid, but nothing worth viewing a second time, save for glimpsing the two gorgeous lipstick lesbians. Not that that is a bad thing, of course, but why not try Penthouse, instead? At least there you won't be subjected to puerile political statements.The film is the first of a trilogy of films, and was followed by Earth and Water, which seem to be less `controversial,' as well as less pointedly provocative. Whether or not this equates with a genuine upgrade of the art is something to be seen, but there is potential here. It's just that Mehta's desire to make a cogent statement so overwhelms her desire to make it endure to future generations, and outside its natal setting, that this film fails. Rein that in, and she has the makings of an artist of consequence.

Forbidden, repressed, ""controlled"", denied, unfulfilled desires. Kulbhushan Kharbanda's character, Ashok, insists that all desires are the root of evil, and a local swami reinforces this belief in him. He does his best controlling all his desires but never takes into account his wife, Radha, for that matter. Being this a male dominant heteropatriarchal society she's just useless and unworthy of any consideration.  The same goes for the other characters and family members. The newlywed couple, Jatin and Sita, has issues of its own. Being frustration the main one.However, desire is involuntary and spontaneous, and whoever falls prey of desire doesn't own it either.  We can act against our impulses, but these stay alive, demanding and insistent. Some desires are more irresistible than others. And this is how we get to the point where the only thing left is to abandon ourselves into it. All control is lost. We then are willing to be seen whole and as we truly are. Reason is lost. All we are left is our desire knocking at our door, and sooner or later we have to decide between opening the door or shutting it forever with all the consequences both choices imply.  Their family dynamic is so emotionally unhealthy, but yet so expected in their society, that no one could have imagined that these ladies would succumb to their desires. Radha and Sita end up entangled together, contacting with and unleashing their own desires. Desire for each other, for love, for passion, for life itself. It's truly interesting to see how this desire shakes everyone and everything around.It's a good movie, but if English is not your mother tongue you might have a hard time getting some of the dialogues. As it's expected they speak with a heavy accent as many us foreigners do, and I couldn't get all the dialogues all the time which frustrated me a bit. I wish the DVD had at least close caption so I could read what they were saying in some parts. The only character I understood well whenever she appeared was Julie, the Chinese mistress. Still, it's a beautiful movie and if you like foreign cinema you might enjoy it. But be warned, the movie is kind of slow and feels week at certain points, and most Westerners are used to live life and expect almost everything on it to happen in a rush.

A typical Indian movie is like a cheesy Hollywood musical.  A Lesbian movie?? Hardly. It isn't about lesbianism because the sister-in-laws were desperate to be loved by someone who's understanding, tender and selfless and they found that in each other without considering that they are about to embark on a lesbian love affair.  This is believeable when you see that there is an abyss  in their lives that only the other can fill.  I think this is more like a sociology film that attempts to show the cultural and moral constraints that are burdened on Indian women and on some level, Indian men.  It is a lot to absorb in one film but Deepa Metha did such a great job in keeping the story tight that you never lose interest.  It is also clastrophobically filmed in a tight apartment complex, that is both physically and mentally choking.  I dropped one star because I think Mehta had a chance to make a stylistic sequence with the two women.  Nandita Das and Shabana Azmi are etheral and this fact was not taken advantage of.  Other than that, I really like this movie.  I do recommend the DVD version because it includes a news footage of a religous cult attacking and smashing a theater in New Delhi showing this film because it did not conform with their dogmatic beliefs. It also includes interviews with the director, the actresses and the cult leader(she's a real Hoot).

184713,A2SRZQU1SZG4RR,1567301568,"Erika Borsos ""pepper flower""","[6, 6]","Like many viewers I delayed seeing this film. I hesitated due to the subject matter and my possible reactions to it. However, curiosity won out and once I viewed it, I was thoroughly impressed with how Deepa Mehta so beautifully and artisically addressed so many social issues and taboos in her society of India. The story revolves around a traditional Indian household where modern life interferes with tradition  - twisting it into knots which become even more tightly pulled together as the film develops. The man of the house Ashok is played by Kulbushan Kharbanda. He becomes a religious fanatic after it is discovered his wife can not conceive a baby. He has chosen to be celibate and a follower of a Hindu guru who teaches that by withholding sexual expression he will advance more quickly in his spiritual growth and come closer to discovering ""truth"". Ashok's younger brother, Jutin had agreed to an arranged marriage with the beautiful Sita. His true love is Julie, who is Chinese and very modern in her behavior. He felt she would not be accepted as his wife by his traditional family, so he entered into the marriage for the wrong reasons. Sita is welcomed into the household but soon learns Jutin has no interest in her. Sita is a young woman who has some modern ideas about personal freedom and expressing her needs and desires. When she and Jutin visit the Taj Mahal together, Jutin stays behind, near a building to smoke a cigarette. When Sita attempts to converse with him, he indifferently replies to her questions, exactly when the tour guide is describing how the Taj Mahal was built to honor the wife of a King due to his great love for her after she died. The contrast and symbolism is so clearn and evident. Sita has certain expectations about marriage and how a husband should behave towards his wife. They are very basic expectations, such as he should show an interest in her likes and dislikes and be gentle and kind ...Through chance and fate, the two women of the household are thrown together to work in the family business, a restaurant where they cook take-out food. Each is wrapped up with her personal problems associated with their marriage. They share a common bond of friendship and eventually talk to each other about how they feel rejected by their husbands. They gradually develop a closeness which turns into a more intimate physical relationship. Initially, it makes both of them  uncomfortable but the relationship continues to grow into something real. The film does not show any explicit physical behavior but implies it by showing the women together in bed ... Unfortunatly, the servant Mundu becomes aware of what is transpiring between them. He eventually reports it to Ashok.I love how a Hindu religious story from the Ramayana about how a god tests the purity of his wife through fire is symbolically played out within this film to represent how the love between these two women is tested as the household disintegrates when many truths are revealed about different family members as well as the behavior of the servant Mundu. Even Biji, the mother-in-law who is honored and cared for by the two daughter-in-laws shows her disgust for their behavior by spitting in the face of one of them when she leans over to help Biji eat ...This film explores what are true and authentic feelings between two people in an unacceptable relationship compared to the false expressions of the more acceptable relationships sanctioned by society. It exposes the imperfections and false behaviors associated with traditionally accepted roles. The main theme of the film is honesty in love, even a love that exists within a socially unacceptable situation ... between two women. Many false relationships are exposed. For instance, the superficial physical desires expressed between Jutin and his lover Julie, shows neither dared to defy tradition and express their true love by bringing their relationship out into the open. Ashok physically denies himself in the belief that he will attain a higher expression of truth and achieve a higher spiritual development as a result of his celibacy. In the end, only the courage of the two women remains after the household disintegrates when the truths which are hidden are revealed.

It tackles the subject of tribadism in a society that is quite intolerant of any deviations from the norm. It criticises a great many Indian customs that many find oppressive -- such as the arranging of marriages by others, the importance of status and face, rligious hypocrisy, sexism, the valuation of women in terms of their baby-making capacity, the binding concepts of duty and so on. At the heart of the film is a touching love story that goes beyond such limitations of the society which the two protagnonists find themselves. The film is well-acted and genuine, completely believable from beginning to end, unlike most Bollywood flicks. The main faults of the film as I saw it was first, that the two lovers seem drawn to one another not necessarily by a natural affinity for each other as much as the fact that they are stuck in dead-end marriages with no passion and no rewards. This may play a part in the sexual awakening of the characters, but most people stuck in the same situation will not &quot;turn homosexual&quot;. It seems clear from the beginning of the filmm that the two characters are quite heterosexual -- when Radha does her scene at the end of the movie with Aashok, she makes it quite clear that &quot;without desire she was dead&quot;, and the implication was that if he had desired so, he could have fulfilled her quite completely, and also when Sita seemed very disappointed when her husband seemed to not like her. Such situations do not turn people into homosexuals -- they may seek comfort in others in the same position, but inthe film it is not at all made clear that they are lesbians from the beginning -- quite the opposite. Some people are bisexual, it is true, but most tend to be either hetero- or homosexual. In the case of the ladies in the film, both had insensitive jerks for husbands . . . if this had not been the case, would they have naturally found the need to express their desire in a relationship that they may have otherwise not have considered? The film ignores this. The other fault is the naming of the characters . . . the names Sita and Radha seem contrived deliberately to shock and outrage (imagine a film in America depicting a gay relationship between a man named &quot;Jesus&quot; and another named &quot;Paul&quot;!) by using names associated with various Hinddo scriptures. The film is strong enough to stand on its own and needs no such devices in my opinion. At any rate, the faults do not take much away from the power of the movie. It is indeed a very touching and powerful story -- the images and characters will stay with you a long time after you leave the theatre.",5,Touching Love Story,979344000,"01 13, 2001",2001,2690,"['was', 'great', 'film', 'sense', 'word', 'subject', 'tribadism', 'society', 'quite', 'intolerant', 'deviations', 'norm', 'great', 'many', 'Indian', 'customs', 'many', 'find', 'oppressive', 'such', 'arranging', 'marriages', 'others', 'importance', 'status', 'face', 'rligious', 'hypocrisy', 'sexism', 'valuation', 'women', 'terms', 'baby-making', 'capacity', 'binding', 'concepts', 'duty', 'so', 'heart', 'film', 'touching', 'love', 'story', 'such', 'limitations', 'society', 'two', 'protagnonists', 'find', 'film', 'well-acted', 'genuine', 'completely', 'believable', 'beginning', 'end', 'most', 'Bollywood', 'flicks', 'main', 'faults', 'film', 'saw', 'was', 'first', 'two', 'lovers', 'seem', 'drawn', 'one', 'not', 'necessarily', 'natural', 'affinity', 'other', 'as', 'much', 'fact', 'are', 'stuck', 'dead-end', 'marriages', 'passion', 'rewards', 'may', 'play', 'part', 'sexual', 'awakening', 'characters', 'most', 'people', 'stuck', 'same', 'situation', 'will', 'not', 'quot', 'turn', 'homosexual', 'quot', 'clear', 'beginning', 'filmm', 'two', 'characters', 'are', 'quite', 'heterosexual', 'when', 'Radha', 'scene', 'end', 'movie', 'Aashok', 'quite', 'clear', 'quot', 'desire', 'was', 'dead', 'quot', 'implication', 'was', 'had', 'desired', 'so', 'could', 'have', 'fulfilled', 'quite', 'completely', 'also', 'when', 'Sita', 'seemed', 'very', 'disappointed', 'when', 'husband', 'seemed', 'not', 'Such', 'situations', 'do', 'not', 'turn', 'people', 'homosexuals', 'may', 'seek', 'comfort', 'others', 'same', 'position', 'film', 'not', 'made', 'clear', 'are', 'lesbians', 'beginning', 'quite', 'opposite', 'people', 'are', 'bisexual', 'true', 'most', 'tend', 'be', 'either', 'hetero-', 'homosexual', 'case', 'ladies', 'film', 'had', 'insensitive', 'jerks', 'husbands', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'case', 'would', 'have', 'naturally', 'found', 'need', 'express', 'desire', 'relationship', 'may', 'have', 'otherwise', 'not', 'have', 'considered', 'film', 'other', 'fault', 'naming', 'characters', 'names', 'Sita', 'Radha', 'seem', 'contrived', 'deliberately', 'shock', 'outrage', 'imagine', 'film', 'America', 'depicting', 'gay', 'relationship', 'man', 'named', 'quot', 'Jesus', 'quot', 'named', 'quot', 'Paul', 'quot', 'using', 'names', 'associated', 'various', 'Hinddo', 'scriptures', 'film', 'strong', 'enough', 'stand', 'own', 'such', 'devices', 'opinion', 'rate', 'faults', 'do', 'not', 'take', 'much', 'away', 'power', 'movie', 'indeed', 'very', 'touching', 'powerful', 'story', 'images', 'characters', 'will', 'stay', 'long', 'time', 'leave', 'theatre']",Fire VHS

Both are in loveless male-dominated arranged marriages with two insensitive men. They are part of an Indian extended family that includes an elderly matriarch who cannot speak because of a stroke but lets her wishes be made known often and loudly with the assistance of a hand bell. A servant, kinky enough to be a character of a Carson McCullers novel, completes this dysfunctional family.The fire within the movie is nothing compared to the storm that erupted when the movie opened in Bombay. Middle-class men and enough women to bring shame to their species caused a riot, breaking glass, tearing down the advertisements for the film, etc. Not only do the two women in the film love each other, but they kiss, they have the fortitude to say no to boorish husbands, and their ultimate sin is that they are Hindu.Too often the added footage to a DVD is actors and directors patting each other on their egotistical backs and should best be avoided. Not so in this instance. The interviews with the directors, the actors and the poor joker who had the misfortune to own the theatre that was attacked are included.My one complaint about the film is that some of the characters' English is difficult to follow.

184720,A25JH6CO4DVINS,1567301568,Junglies,"[2, 2]","I find this film to be an intense intellectual experience on several levels.Ostensibly an Indian movie on the taboo subject of female relationships there is a clear parable involving the spiritual versus the secular where one brother, married to a barren wife seeks to overcome his human desires through following the teachings of a swami. His brother, the proprietor of a video store, has a relationship with a Chinese woman but goes through with an arranged marriage in conformity with family tradition. The strains of tradition force the two women to seek comfort in each other, developing a relationship between them where desires are awakened and love overcomes the taboos enforced by a patriarchal society. In the background is the handicapped matriarch who's care is the responsibility of a young man who abuses the responsibility entrusted to him, but which heightens the lack of respect women hold in that society.On a different level, the film nicely illustrates the conflicts involed in a society which is in the throes of a transition to modernity. The ols quasi-religious notions are being usurped as contemporary capitalistic globalisation forces drive deep into the urban population. The brothers sybolise the old and the new. The old holds that spirituality is the glue which holds society together whilst the new stresses individuality and business meeting individual needs. In this sense the two women show how the new notions corrupt and subsume the old. the relationship which develops is based on desire and the concept of selfishness which may or may not be long lasting and worthwhile.Choosing thus overlooks the plight of those women in India who are excluded from society upon divorce or widowhood and other social issues but neverthe less this is an important film not just for the representation of the modernisation of India but to gives us a glimpse of some of the issues involved in the West in our own journey to industrialisation and beyond.An altogether excellent, even extraordinary film.",5,Fire: Burning Bridges,1235347200,"02 23, 2009",2009,2022,"['find', 'film', 'be', 'intense', 'intellectual', 'experience', 'several', 'levels.Ostensibly', 'Indian', 'movie', 'taboo', 'subject', 'female', 'relationships', 'clear', 'parable', 'involving', 'spiritual', 'versus', 'secular', 'where', 'one', 'brother', 'married', 'barren', 'wife', 'overcome', 'human', 'desires', 'following', 'teachings', 'swami', 'brother', 'proprietor', 'video', 'store', 'relationship', 'Chinese', 'woman', 'through', 'arranged', 'marriage', 'conformity', 'family', 'tradition', 'strains', 'tradition', 'force', 'two', 'women', 'seek', 'comfort', 'other', 'developing', 'relationship', 'where', 'desires', 'are', 'awakened', 'love', 'taboos', 'enforced', 'patriarchal', 'society', 'background', 'handicapped', 'matriarch', 'who', 'care', 'responsibility', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'responsibility', 'entrusted', 'lack', 'respect', 'women', 'hold', 'society.On', 'different', 'level', 'film', 'nicely', 'conflicts', 'involed', 'society', 'throes', 'transition', 'modernity', 'ols', 'quasi-religious', 'notions', 'are', 'being', 'usurped', 'contemporary', 'capitalistic', 'globalisation', 'forces', 'drive', 'deep', 'urban', 'population', 'brothers', 'sybolise', 'old', 'new', 'old', 'spirituality', 'glue', 'society', 'together', 'whilst', 'new', 'stresses', 'individuality', 'business', 'meeting', 'individual', 'needs', 'sense', 'two', 'women', 'show', 'how', 'new', 'notions', 'corrupt', 'subsume', 'old', 'relationship', 'based', 'desire', 'concept', 'selfishness', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'long', 'lasting', 'worthwhile.Choosing', 'thus', 'plight', 'women', 'India', 'who', 'are', 'excluded', 'society', 'divorce', 'widowhood', 'other', 'social', 'issues', 'neverthe', 'less', 'important', 'film', 'not', 'just', 'representation', 'modernisation', 'India', 'glimpse', 'issues', 'involved', 'West', 'own', 'journey', 'industrialisation', 'beyond.An', 'altogether', 'excellent', 'even', 'extraordinary', 'film']",Fire VHS

However I am glad that my friend persuaded me to give it a chance.  This is a beautiful film, about a taboo subject in  India, and it is handled magnificently by the director and cast alike.  It  follows the story of two sister-in-laws (Azmi and Das) who dare to fall in  love with each other.  Not only do they fall in love but they conspire to  leave their inadequate husbands.  Azmi is married to a man who is unable to  consummate their marriage, and Das' husband is unfaithful to her, desiring  his Chinese mistress over his chosen bride.  Azmi and Das are living in an  unforgiving world.  The path they have chosen to follow is fraught with  intolerance and danger and they have no allies save each other.  As their  relationship deepens so does the need for escape.  This is not just an  artsy movie, it is funny, sad and genuinely moving.  It also has some  darkly funny moments, watch the scene with the family servant, and the  porno movies, it has to be seen to be believed. Leonard Maltin saw this  film as a male bashing Lesbian chick flick, claiming that the male  characters in the film were nothing more than &quot;simplistic chauvinist  pig[s].&quot;  It is obvious that Mr. Maltin has not lived in India where  more often than not men rule and women obey and should you want to be  different then God help you because no one else will.  This film is  ultimately about love, hope, redemption and purification; fire being a  purifier and therefore when Azmi survives her husband's attempt to burn her  to death she proves to the viewer that she is pure, and the Gods do not  disapprove of her sexuality. This is a wonderful film, well acted and  superbly directed.

Here, she introduces the viewer to a beautifully photographed bustling city where an extended family live together and run a video store and restaurant.  When the younger philandering brother marries in an arranged marriage and brings his bride to the household, we get to meet the family through the young woman's eyes.  There's the bedridden elderly mother who cannot speak but uses a small bell to make her wants known.  There's her husband's brother who has taken a vow of celibacy because his wife is infertile.  And there's the male servant who indulges in his own kind of gratification.The two sister-in-laws are unhappy.  A forbidden romance between them ensues.The entire theme is handled in an understated way and the romantic scenes between the women are clouded in shadow.  There's a lot unsaid.  And yet, the film is about a lot more than just these two women and their predicament.  It is about the emerging role of women to make choices in a modern Indian society.  It's about the deep conflicts between tradition and the reality of modern times.The entire cast does an excellent job.  I felt I was right there in that household.  And the director even introduced some mysticism and epic poetry.  It was a gentle film though, in spite of its bold theme.  And that is what made it interesting.The characters all spoke English, which made the film easy for me to watch.  But, in spite of it being well done, I found it slow and boring in parts.  There were few new plot developments  to hold my interest, just an elaboration of the same theme.  It was only 104 minutes long but was too long to me.If Indian films are new to you, this might be a good introduction.

Now that is what I call ho-bloody-hum (ahem, Mr Maltin).  This film is a blessed relief from that genre.Although sexuality is openly portrayed and discussed in the film, intimacy between the two female protagonists is handled tastefully and without that nasty overtone of voyeuristic exploitation.  Leonard Maltin, useful though his reviews are, has a history of getting really defensive (and dismissive) about films with any feminist content.  If overbearing patriarchal authority is honestly and accurately portrayed, he's liable to diss the film as unfair to men.  Notably he has very little to say about insulting or belittling roles for *female* actors!I thought this was a good-hearted film, honestly challenging  and critical of male privilege and selfishness, yet also extending compassion and dignity to its male as well as female characters.  Even the nastiest person in the film (the unfortunate servant) is not treated with genuine contempt by the scriptwriter or director.  Everyone gets his or her day in court; we feel a little sympathy with every character at least once or twice.It's also a sensitive and poignant portrait of the cost of tradition, and the cost of defying tradition.  The violence and controversy it sparked in the conservative Hindu state of Maharashtra are documented in the &quot;extras&quot;;  more than anything else, the ability of this film to panic conservative forces, and thereby elicit mob violence, speaks to its power and lasting value as a challenge to institutions that (however benign they may seem on the surface) keep women down.",5,good-hearted and in good taste,970185600,"09 29, 2000",2000,1827,"['too', 'often', 'when', 'film', 'billed', 'quot', 'controversial', 'quot', 'dealing', 'quot', 'quot', 'subjects', 'uh-oh', 'quot', 'lesbian', 'love', 'quot', 'out', 'be', 'just', 'soft', 'porno', 'exploitation', 'flick', 'amusement', 'male', 'viewers', 'Now', 'what', 'call', 'ho-bloody-hum', 'ahem', 'Mr', 'Maltin', 'film', 'blessed', 'relief', 'genre.Although', 'sexuality', 'openly', 'portrayed', 'discussed', 'film', 'intimacy', 'two', 'female', 'protagonists', 'handled', 'tastefully', 'nasty', 'overtone', 'voyeuristic', 'exploitation', 'Leonard', 'Maltin', 'useful', 'reviews', 'are', 'history', 'getting', 'really', 'defensive', 'dismissive', 'films', 'feminist', 'content', 'overbearing', 'patriarchal', 'authority', 'honestly', 'accurately', 'portrayed', 'liable', 'diss', 'film', 'unfair', 'men', 'Notably', 'very', 'little', 'say', 'insulting', 'belittling', 'roles', '*female*', 'actors', 'thought', 'was', 'good-hearted', 'film', 'honestly', 'challenging', 'critical', 'male', 'privilege', 'selfishness', 'yet', 'also', 'extending', 'compassion', 'dignity', 'male', 'as', 'well', 'female', 'characters', 'Even', 'nastiest', 'person', 'film', 'unfortunate', 'servant', 'not', 'treated', 'genuine', 'contempt', 'scriptwriter', 'director', 'Everyone', 'day', 'court', 'feel', 'little', 'sympathy', 'character', 'least', 'once', 'twice.It', 'also', 'sensitive', 'poignant', 'portrait', 'cost', 'tradition', 'cost', 'defying', 'tradition', 'violence', 'controversy', 'sparked', 'conservative', 'Hindu', 'state', 'Maharashtra', 'are', 'documented', 'quot', 'quot', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'ability', 'film', 'panic', 'conservative', 'forces', 'thereby', 'elicit', 'mob', 'violence', 'power', 'lasting', 'value', 'challenge', 'institutions', 'however', 'may', 'seem', 'surface', 'keep', 'women', 'down']",Fire VHS

184740,A91YY4W9MB3R9,1567301568,"T. Rosa ""celluloid526""","[10, 11]","Fire... is a great story about the dynamics of freeing yourself from the sometimes unbearble chains of tradition. The hidden treasure in this story is the discovery that even the ones who seemingly hold the keys to the locks on these chains are themselves bound by them.With the third installment of this trilogy (Fire, Earth and Water) finally completed, I thought I would throw in my take on this wonderful movie. In short this is a study that proves my understanding that everyone in this life needs attention and everyone seeks it and obtains it in their own way...sometimes without regard for themselves, others, their traditions, or for the society in which they live.Until Radha and Sita connect in spirit, each lacks in the fulfillment of knowing their value, self worth, purpose, potential for happiness or the warmth of intimacy that any human desires. Unfortunately too often too many fail to realize this need until it is too late. For Sita and Radha, they manage to break through the veil of oppression and do so because of their new found selves.  Sita, too young to go gentle into that dreariest of dreary life, and Radha who long ago accepted her fate as a wife filled with guilt instead of life, must embrace each other to feel themselves and their worth...and their desires. How inspirational!Truly this discovery has nothing to do with the sexual side of the relationship. This is not about being lesbians...which I am. For some lesbians this is precisely the thread that draws us to another. It's about needing to feel alive. In which case we are no different than anyone else. Neither are Sita and Radha.But if it were about sex, which it is not, in truth sexual desire has been a driving catalyst for many fairy tales, wars and the sole inspiration of many conquerors.  Why shouldn't it be the same for these two? They have conquered the norm through tremendous risk. Not unlike Snow White or Sleeping Beauty, they are brought back to life with a kiss. It is a revelation for both women. They desire life. Isn't that what any of us wants?  A desire to live and feel...not just exist.In Hindu tradition, even after walking through the fire to prove her purity and faithfulness...Ram still send his love away...and it breaks his heart to do so. The truth is that she has proven to be too pure of heart.  A purity that even he was not wirthy of. Radha walks through the fire of her life, survives and is cleansed by the rain. It is predictable but still poetic.I love all of the characters in this story.  From the muted bell-ringing- see all grandmother to the hopelessly in-love self-pleasuring saboteur servant.  It is all poetic because in life the flicker of flames and pangs of desire are, in all their pain and glory, poetry.It's just a story but I believe it to be very inspiring.",5,"The burning need for love, respect and acknowledgement is the fuel of Fire",1151539200,"06 29, 2006",2006,2807,"['Fire', 'great', 'story', 'dynamics', 'freeing', 'sometimes', 'unbearble', 'chains', 'tradition', 'hidden', 'treasure', 'story', 'discovery', 'even', 'ones', 'who', 'seemingly', 'hold', 'keys', 'locks', 'chains', 'are', 'them.With', 'third', 'installment', 'trilogy', 'Fire', 'Earth', 'Water', 'finally', 'completed', 'thought', 'would', 'throw', 'take', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'short', 'study', 'understanding', 'everyone', 'life', 'attention', 'everyone', 'own', 'way', 'sometimes', 'regard', 'others', 'traditions', 'society', 'live.Until', 'Radha', 'Sita', 'connect', 'spirit', 'lacks', 'fulfillment', 'knowing', 'value', 'worth', 'purpose', 'potential', 'happiness', 'warmth', 'intimacy', 'human', 'desires', 'Unfortunately', 'too', 'often', 'too', 'many', 'fail', 'realize', 'need', 'too', 'late', 'Sita', 'Radha', 'manage', 'break', 'veil', 'oppression', 'do', 'so', 'new', 'found', 'selves', 'Sita', 'too', 'young', 'go', 'gentle', 'dreariest', 'dreary', 'life', 'Radha', 'who', 'long', 'ago', 'accepted', 'fate', 'wife', 'filled', 'guilt', 'instead', 'life', 'must', 'embrace', 'other', 'feel', 'worth', 'desires', 'How', 'inspirational', 'Truly', 'discovery', 'nothing', 'do', 'sexual', 'side', 'relationship', 'not', 'being', 'lesbians', 'am', 'lesbians', 'precisely', 'thread', 'needing', 'feel', 'alive', 'case', 'are', 'different', 'anyone', 'else', 'are', 'Sita', 'Radha.But', 'were', 'about', 'sex', 'not', 'truth', 'sexual', 'desire', 'been', 'driving', 'catalyst', 'many', 'fairy', 'tales', 'wars', 'sole', 'inspiration', 'many', 'conquerors', 'Why', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'same', 'two', 'have', 'conquered', 'norm', 'tremendous', 'risk', 'Not', 'Snow', 'White', 'Sleeping', 'Beauty', 'are', 'brought', 'back', 'life', 'kiss', 'revelation', 'women', 'desire', 'life', ""n't"", 'what', 'desire', 'live', 'feel', 'not', 'just', 'exist.In', 'Hindu', 'tradition', 'even', 'walking', 'fire', 'prove', 'purity', 'faithfulness', 'Ram', 'still', 'send', 'love', 'away', 'heart', 'do', 'so', 'truth', 'proven', 'be', 'too', 'pure', 'heart', 'purity', 'even', 'was', 'not', 'wirthy', 'Radha', 'fire', 'life', 'survives', 'cleansed', 'rain', 'predictable', 'still', 'poetic.I', 'characters', 'story', 'muted', 'bell-ringing-', 'see', 'grandmother', 'hopelessly', 'in-love', 'self-pleasuring', 'saboteur', 'servant', 'poetic', 'life', 'flicker', 'flames', 'pangs', 'desire', 'are', 'pain', 'glory', 'poetry.It', 'just', 'story', 'believe', 'be', 'very', 'inspiring']",Fire VHS

There is much more to this film than the homosexuality factor, so much that it seems kind of irrelevent to even focus on the fact that two gorgeous indian women explore their sexuality with one another. This is a film that broke barriers, and caused an outrage in India when it was released because it stigmatized and contradicted the culture and traditions of India that have never been confronted or questioned. I don't understand why this film isn't recognized for its daring effort and creativity. This film is universal to all people who have conflicts with balancing traditions and their own personal lives at the same time. If only more people would know about this film, and not just look at this as an lesbian film. It's truly a wonderful and well made film.
