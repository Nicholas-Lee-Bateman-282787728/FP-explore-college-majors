Wonderful series, of course. Robert Hardy is always marvelous, whether here, or stealing scenes in ""Harry Potter."" As other viewers have noted, the changing of the Helens is odd at first, but you get used to it, as Lynda Bellingham does a great job. Peter Davison is pitch-perfect. The excellent John McGlynn is an enlivening addition, quite true to the ""real"" Herriot character.I've raised various creatures, and been knocked off a milking stool several times. These books and DVD portrayals are timeless. For your complete viewing pleasure: don't plan on going anywhere, just sit back and enjoy with a shot of aged single malt, peat-scented Islay Scotch Whisky, like ""Laphroaig."" The discerning Siegfried Farnon would appreciate it too. Sip along with the vets, who have a supernatural capacity to work and imbibe.

833068,A3160YSU1KRL8E,B0002F6BTW,Justin Playfair,"[37, 40]","I have had the opportunity to review all of the previous ""All Creatures Great and Small"" series of DVD's and since this is the final group I felt obligated to acquire it despite critical reviews posted by VHS owners. Of course, we as fans love the charm of this series and I hoped for the best. But I must report that there is a strange loss of magic to this particular group. You get the feeling of characters just doing what is necessary and matching the ""austerity"" of the era that they are trying to convey. I think it is due to a more stern attitude and as one other writer had said ""loss of innocence"" on behalf of the ""James Herriot"" character coupled with the unfamiliar nature of the actress assigned to play his wife. The filming also seems a little cheaper, not as colorful and Robert Hardy does not shout about as much probably due to the successful employment of Tristan in the Agriculture industry. In positive light we have a few repeat characters, Biggins, Dr. Granville Bennett, etc. but the episodes definitely reflect the hard times that Britain went through right after the war. We would like the characters to go on eternally, like 'Star Trek' became to Science Fiction fans but in my gut feeling I think we would have been better off if they had ended it with Carol Drinkwater and the Christmas Specials that still complied with Herriot's original book. I still strongly recommend the Reader's Digest 1983 book published in company with St. Martin's press, ""The Best of James Herriot: The Favorite Stories of One of the Most Beloved Writers of Our Time"" This delves into what you see on screen and says a LOT about gadgets and lifestyles that you see on the Dales.

833069,A3TGCEFBB71MMR,B0002F6BTW,Mark Antony,"[17, 17]","The first three series of All Creatures Great and Small, based on the popular James Herriot books,  told the story of how Herriot, (Christopher Timothy) newly qualified, travelled from native Scotland to Yorkshire to join the practice run by Siegfried Farnham (Robert Hardy)It was the story not only of the humourous, touching dramas involved in running a vetinery practice, but also the story of Herriots romance and subsequent marriage to local girl Helen, played by Carol Drinkwater in the early years. The series concluded with the partners joining the war in 1940.After two Christmas specials, the series began again after the war, starting with this series four. This time with Lynda Bellingham playing the role of Helen, instilling the character with a mumsy charm, as opposed to the more alluring Drinkwater.The series was a classic, making much of people love of nostalgia, the cosy fireside chats in evenings, listening to Lamplight on the radio, and following historical events as the story unfolded.Some thought the series was not quite the same after the war. One issue was the series was not taken from the books of Herriot, but written by new writers, who perhaps did not understand the characters as well as the splendid cast who had grown into their roles. Some continuity errors came up, for example, the age of the Herriots children, the second born just after the war, was somehow aged 12 around the Queens coronation year, in 1952.Nevertheless, there were still some wonderful moments to enjoy, mostly involving the great interplay between Siegfreid, superbly played by Robert Hardy,  and his phillerandering Brother, Tristan (Peter Davison). Some slow paying clients, best illustrated by the crusty Biggings making Herriots life a misery, and some hilarious cases, all mingled around the Yorkshire community and their colourful characters.This series sees James and Helens struggles to own their first home and the introduction  of  a new character, Callum Buchannon, a colourful, outgoing Scottish vet, with a fascination for wildlife, among other things, and his subsequent romance with the former girlfreind of Tristan, Diedre.Perhaps not the best All Creatures and Small series, but still wonderful.",4,Continuation of the classic series,1094342400,"09 5, 2004",2004,2225,"['first', 'three', 'series', 'All', 'Creatures', 'Great', 'Small', 'based', 'popular', 'James', 'Herriot', 'books', 'told', 'story', 'how', 'Herriot', 'Christopher', 'Timothy', 'newly', 'qualified', 'travelled', 'native', 'Scotland', 'Yorkshire', 'join', 'practice', 'run', 'Siegfried', 'Farnham', 'Robert', 'Hardy', 'was', 'story', 'not', 'only', 'humourous', 'touching', 'dramas', 'involved', 'running', 'vetinery', 'practice', 'also', 'story', 'Herriots', 'romance', 'subsequent', 'marriage', 'local', 'girl', 'Helen', 'played', 'Carol', 'Drinkwater', 'early', 'years', 'series', 'concluded', 'partners', 'joining', 'war', '1940.After', 'two', 'Christmas', 'specials', 'series', 'began', 'again', 'war', 'starting', 'series', 'four', 'time', 'Lynda', 'Bellingham', 'playing', 'role', 'Helen', 'instilling', 'character', 'mumsy', 'charm', 'opposed', 'more', 'alluring', 'Drinkwater.The', 'series', 'was', 'classic', 'making', 'much', 'people', 'nostalgia', 'cosy', 'fireside', 'chats', 'evenings', 'listening', 'Lamplight', 'radio', 'following', 'historical', 'events', 'story', 'unfolded.Some', 'thought', 'series', 'was', 'not', 'quite', 'same', 'war', 'One', 'issue', 'was', 'series', 'was', 'not', 'taken', 'books', 'Herriot', 'written', 'new', 'writers', 'who', 'perhaps', 'did', 'not', 'understand', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'splendid', 'cast', 'who', 'had', 'grown', 'roles', 'continuity', 'errors', 'came', 'up', 'example', 'age', 'Herriots', 'children', 'second', 'born', 'just', 'war', 'was', 'somehow', 'aged', '12', 'Queens', 'coronation', 'year', '1952.Nevertheless', 'were', 'still', 'wonderful', 'moments', 'enjoy', 'mostly', 'involving', 'great', 'interplay', 'Siegfreid', 'superbly', 'played', 'Robert', 'Hardy', 'phillerandering', 'Brother', 'Tristan', 'Peter', 'Davison', 'slow', 'paying', 'clients', 'best', 'illustrated', 'crusty', 'Biggings', 'making', 'Herriots', 'life', 'misery', 'hilarious', 'cases', 'mingled', 'Yorkshire', 'community', 'colourful', 'characters.This', 'series', 'James', 'Helens', 'own', 'first', 'home', 'introduction', 'new', 'character', 'Callum', 'Buchannon', 'colourful', 'outgoing', 'Scottish', 'vet', 'fascination', 'wildlife', 'other', 'things', 'subsequent', 'romance', 'former', 'girlfreind', 'Tristan', 'Diedre.Perhaps', 'not', 'best', 'Creatures', 'Small', 'series', 'still', 'wonderful']",N/A

She has a gentleness and a mature, quiet charm that suit the character of a lady who has seen her husband and friends off to a world war, been fortunate enough to have them back again, and is now raising a family in a changed and changing world (though in the Dales change may be slower, it is just as ineveitable).I enjoyed the character of Calum, and Tris is still full of high-jinks, made even more entertaining by his advancement to the Ministry of Agriculture. The local farmers and their families (including their animals) are the real stars of the show, and they seem even better than in the first three series. Robert Hardy is only slightly less explosive but no less lovable. The beauty of the scenery is even more breath-taking; on this DVD it seems even sharper, perhaps because these are later episodes and may have been filmed with more up-to-date equipment.If you are thinking of purchasing this set, I shouldn't be put off by some of the less positive reviews---it succeeds very well, even though it is not identical to the earlier productions.",5,Equally enjoyable!,1155254400,"08 11, 2006",2006,1321,"['Having', 'read', 'reviews', 'here', 'prior', 'purchasing', 'series', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'sure', 'what', 'expect', '-but', 'was', 'delighted', 'see', 'series', 'had', 'more', 'retained', 'entrancing', 'charm.No', 'Lynda', 'Bellamy', 'not', 'Carol', 'Drinkwater', 'own', 'very', 'well', 'indeed', 'gentleness', 'mature', 'quiet', 'charm', 'suit', 'character', 'lady', 'who', 'seen', 'husband', 'friends', 'world', 'war', 'been', 'fortunate', 'enough', 'have', 'back', 'again', 'now', 'raising', 'family', 'changed', 'changing', 'world', 'Dales', 'change', 'may', 'be', 'slower', 'just', 'ineveitable', '.I', 'enjoyed', 'character', 'Calum', 'Tris', 'still', 'full', 'high-jinks', 'made', 'even', 'more', 'entertaining', 'advancement', 'Ministry', 'Agriculture', 'local', 'farmers', 'families', 'including', 'animals', 'are', 'real', 'stars', 'show', 'seem', 'even', 'better', 'first', 'three', 'series', 'Robert', 'Hardy', 'only', 'slightly', 'less', 'explosive', 'less', 'lovable', 'beauty', 'scenery', 'even', 'more', 'breath-taking', 'DVD', 'even', 'sharper', 'perhaps', 'are', 'later', 'episodes', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'filmed', 'more', 'up-to-date', 'equipment.If', 'are', 'thinking', 'purchasing', 'set', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'put', 'off', 'less', 'positive', 'reviews', '-it', 'very', 'well', 'even', 'not', 'identical', 'earlier', 'productions']",N/A
