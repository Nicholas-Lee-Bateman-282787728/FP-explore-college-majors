On the other hand Ousmane (Sotigui Kouyate) is a  West African Muslim who has come from France to find his missing son.Both parents are unknowingly inextricably linked by the traps of destiny and will face more call the tragedy of racial prejudice or religious beliefs.A concise and memorable film, where nothing is reiterative, which had a flawless script, masterful performances and superb direction both behind the scenes of Bouhareb Rachid.A bold, stark and bleak movie that takes a tiny portion of this collective tragedy that rocked the city of London in that fateful year.You can not ignore one of the thirty best films of this decade for the world.

The movie revolves around the events of London Bombing and how four lives intersect through death, violence and parental love. Of course, it deals with race relations and inherent tensions expected in a multicultural and multi-racial society. I am an implanted American, and this movie will have different appeal to American audience that, say a British one; it's simply because the dynamics of race relations and fear of the unknown take a different form in different societies. Yet, the movie tried to create a thread to connect various pieces of human experience. You can easily notice symbolism and unintentional nudge from the director about race, gender, religion, situations that are socially inevitable, and a total encourage to accept ourselves as not too different from the guy/girl who look so different at first glimpse. Four star, because I think the camer work could be better. The two main characters did excellent job.",4,I guess it insists on love...,1385769600,"11 30, 2013",2013,1007,"['enjoy', 'movie', 'emotional', 'horizon', 'will', 'like', 'movie', 'events', 'London', 'Bombing', 'how', 'four', 'lives', 'intersect', 'death', 'violence', 'parental', 'love', 'course', 'race', 'relations', 'inherent', 'tensions', 'expected', 'multicultural', 'multi-racial', 'society', 'am', 'implanted', 'American', 'movie', 'will', 'have', 'different', 'appeal', 'American', 'audience', 'say', 'British', 'one', 'simply', 'dynamics', 'race', 'relations', 'fear', 'unknown', 'take', 'different', 'form', 'different', 'societies', 'movie', 'tried', 'create', 'thread', 'connect', 'various', 'pieces', 'human', 'experience', 'can', 'easily', 'notice', 'symbolism', 'unintentional', 'nudge', 'director', 'race', 'gender', 'religion', 'situations', 'are', 'socially', 'inevitable', 'total', 'encourage', 'accept', 'not', 'too', 'different', 'guy/girl', 'who', 'look', 'so', 'different', 'first', 'glimpse', 'Four', 'star', 'think', 'camer', 'work', 'could', 'be', 'better', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'did', 'excellent', 'job']",London River [Region 2]

To see people in other countries face the loss and not knowing in the same manner we do when terror comes to the states. I am a huge Brenda Blethyn fan which is what drew me to this film and she delivered a wonderful performance in the work.

1369636,AWUUMER0F3WF4,B003WOSKOY,Sheryl Fechter,"[5, 5]","Directed by Rachid Bouchareb, this movie is set in England during and following the bus bombings of July seventh, 2005.  A long widowed mother, Elisabeth (Brenda Blethyn) has been watching the happenings on her television during the day, leaving messages for her daughter, Jane, to call her back. Where is her daughter who is prompt in returning calls?Elisabeth lives in the lush countryside by the river on a small farm.  She spends her days doing many different things with tending to her animals and with her church activity.  She frequents the cemetery where her husband, William, has been laid to rest after his service in the war.  She talks to him as if they were carrying on a conversation and also sees her brother Edward at the farm.  Hers is a simple but fulfilling life.A lone man, Ousmane (Sotigui Kouyate), has traveled from Africa fifteen years prior, now residing in France although has journeyed to London.  He has come to look for his son Ali, after the bombing has caused him to go missing.  Ousmane had promised his wife that he will find and return him to his family in Africa.  Ousmane and his wife live separate lives, although their son is first priority.Elisabeth becomes more and more desperate while waiting for the phone to ring with Jane safely on the line, although no call comes for her.  The next morning she quickly goes into London to her daughter's flat.  Jane is not there and hasn't been since the day before.  Elisabeth starts the necessary steps to search for her daughter while during this time Ousmane is doing the same for his son Ali.The movie poses: How in the world does this unlikely pair meet to search for their children?  What do they find alike in each other?  Along with, Could it be possible to not find their children alive?This is a very human story which is very slow paced, happily so for me.  It gave time to really drink in the deep emotions that come to the surface and the blending of two completely opposite people as far as religious beliefs.  Exploring more of the pain and the depth of feeling in the characters of Elisabeth and Ousmane through this horrid situation.  The director digs deep with Brenda Blethyn to bring out a range of pure gut-wrenching pain to happiness and everything in between.  She is just spectacular in this movie, as is Sotigui Kouyate in his own quiet expressive way.Be ready to run the 'gamut' in this scenic and overtly emotional movie.",5,Allow These Two Lonely Travelers To Fill Your Heart...,1331510400,"03 12, 2012",2012,2429,"['Directed', 'Rachid', 'Bouchareb', 'movie', 'set', 'England', 'following', 'bus', 'bombings', 'July', 'seventh', '2005', 'long', 'widowed', 'mother', 'Elisabeth', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'been', 'watching', 'happenings', 'television', 'day', 'leaving', 'messages', 'daughter', 'Jane', 'call', 'back', 'Where', 'daughter', 'who', 'prompt', 'returning', 'calls', 'Elisabeth', 'lush', 'countryside', 'river', 'small', 'farm', 'days', 'doing', 'many', 'different', 'things', 'tending', 'animals', 'church', 'activity', 'cemetery', 'where', 'husband', 'William', 'been', 'laid', 'rest', 'service', 'war', 'were', 'carrying', 'conversation', 'also', 'brother', 'Edward', 'farm', 'Hers', 'simple', 'fulfilling', 'life.A', 'lone', 'man', 'Ousmane', 'Sotigui', 'Kouyate', 'traveled', 'Africa', 'fifteen', 'years', 'prior', 'now', 'residing', 'France', 'journeyed', 'London', 'come', 'look', 'son', 'Ali', 'bombing', 'caused', 'go', 'missing', 'Ousmane', 'had', 'promised', 'wife', 'will', 'find', 'return', 'family', 'Africa', 'Ousmane', 'wife', 'live', 'separate', 'lives', 'son', 'first', 'priority.Elisabeth', 'becomes', 'more', 'more', 'desperate', 'waiting', 'phone', 'ring', 'Jane', 'safely', 'line', 'call', 'next', 'morning', 'quickly', 'London', 'daughter', 'flat', 'Jane', 'not', 'there', ""n't"", 'been', 'day', 'Elisabeth', 'necessary', 'steps', 'search', 'daughter', 'time', 'Ousmane', 'doing', 'same', 'son', 'Ali.The', 'movie', 'poses', 'How', 'world', 'unlikely', 'pair', 'meet', 'search', 'children', 'What', 'do', 'find', 'alike', 'other', 'Could', 'be', 'possible', 'not', 'find', 'children', 'alive', 'very', 'human', 'story', 'very', 'slow', 'paced', 'happily', 'so', 'gave', 'time', 'really', 'drink', 'deep', 'emotions', 'come', 'surface', 'blending', 'two', 'completely', 'opposite', 'people', 'as', 'far', 'religious', 'beliefs', 'Exploring', 'more', 'pain', 'depth', 'feeling', 'characters', 'Elisabeth', 'Ousmane', 'horrid', 'situation', 'director', 'deep', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'bring', 'out', 'range', 'pure', 'gut-wrenching', 'pain', 'happiness', 'everything', 'just', 'spectacular', 'movie', 'Sotigui', 'Kouyate', 'own', 'quiet', 'expressive', 'way.Be', 'ready', 'run', ""'gamut"", 'scenic', 'overtly', 'emotional', 'movie']",London River [Region 2]
