The music is beautiful and it matches the mood of it after the ""tragic"" accident. A scene that really pulled the emotional strings for me was the family dog silently crying lying on the ground while she was pregnant with her puppies.If you're in a good mood for a major tear-jerker. This will definately fit the bill.",5,Worth Watching,1148947200,"05 30, 2006",2006,454,"['grew', 'up', 'flick', 'watching', 'many', 'times', 'even', 'now', 'cry', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'when', 'first', 'watched', 'movie', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'music', 'beautiful', 'mood', 'tragic', 'accident', 'scene', 'really', 'pulled', 'emotional', 'strings', 'was', 'family', 'silently', 'crying', 'lying', 'ground', 'was', 'pregnant', 'puppies.If', ""'re"", 'good', 'mood', 'major', 'tear-jerker', 'will', 'definately', 'fit', 'bill']",N/A

Perhaps my own horribly miserable divorce is the reason why, because there is a lesson in the movie that all parents should follow: DO WHAT IS BEST FOR THE CHILDREN!John Voight was great in his younger days, as he is today. Each child presented such a different perspective of a parent and child relationship, they were all very sweet.You almost want to hate Richard Crenna, but later realize you are wrong. He loves these kids too, and as I heard somewhere, a child can never be loved by too many people.Trung (oldest boy/adopted) - ""You think I need a friend! I need a father!""Tilde (daugher) - 11-years-old going on 16. But her frailty shows when describing the white rabbit.Truman-Paul (youngest son) - A perfect example how, even under horrible circumstances, kids can healMy only gripe is 5,000 scenes of Kevin Costner. Did he pay someone for face time?Again, it's a dated movie (the credits look like TV credits today), but if you're willing to sit back for 122 minutes and let yourself into their lives, I think you'll love it.And if you do, keep some Kleenix handy.",5,Dated but a fantastic movie,1346198400,"08 29, 2012",2012,1138,"['guy', 'might', 'be', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', '*love*', 'movie', 'Perhaps', 'own', 'horribly', 'miserable', 'divorce', 'reason', 'why', 'lesson', 'movie', 'parents', 'should', 'follow', 'DO', 'WHAT', 'IS', 'BEST', 'THE', 'CHILDREN', 'John', 'Voight', 'was', 'great', 'younger', 'days', 'today', 'child', 'presented', 'different', 'perspective', 'parent', 'child', 'relationship', 'were', 'very', 'sweet.You', 'almost', 'want', 'hate', 'Richard', 'Crenna', 'later', 'realize', 'are', 'wrong', 'kids', 'too', 'heard', 'somewhere', 'child', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'loved', 'too', 'many', 'people.Trung', 'oldest', 'boy/adopted', 'think', 'need', 'friend', 'need', 'father', 'Tilde', 'daugher', '11-years-old', 'going', '16', 'frailty', 'shows', 'when', 'describing', 'white', 'rabbit.Truman-Paul', 'youngest', 'son', 'perfect', 'example', 'how', 'even', 'horrible', 'circumstances', 'kids', 'can', 'healMy', 'only', 'gripe', '5,000', 'scenes', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'Did', 'pay', 'someone', 'face', 'time', 'Again', 'dated', 'movie', 'credits', 'look', 'TV', 'credits', 'today', ""'re"", 'willing', 'sit', 'back', '122', 'minutes', 'let', 'lives', 'think', ""'ll"", 'love', 'it.And', 'do', 'keep', 'Kleenix', 'handy']",N/A

Even greater than what he did in ""Coming Home"" and ""Midnight Cowboy.""  But what is really special about this movie are the children, especially Roxanne Zal.
