Sadly, production values for television usually aren't comparable with theatrical releases.  This movie proves the rule not the exception.  Unlike a lot of other reviews posted here, I didn't have that many issues with the acting.  Well, James Brolin seemed a bit out of sorts, as though he was unaccustomed to this type of film and really didn't know what was required of him.  As for Ben Cross, he bulged his eyes in an appropriately maniacal manner and called it a day.  The rest of the main cast did pretty much what one would expect from people starting out in the business.  As for the story, that's where I had concerns.  To say they challenged Biblical doctrine is putting it mildly.  For good measure, they tossed in some conspiracy theories, alien technology, global warming, and a crazy cardinal or two.  I could have done without the pompous narrative droned by James Brolin but I suppose they had to start with something to kick the story off.  Comparing this to other films like Waterworld and Raiders of the Lost Ark smacks of desperation.  If you don't know how to describe it from its own merits, don't say anything at all.  I think I'm paraphrasing Thumper, but you get the point.Though I can't explain why, I actually liked this dopey mess and feel thoroughly demoralized because of it.

It had an interesting concept and a whole lot of eye candy, but due to it's budget, the effects and cast needed to make it work are seriously lacking. The year is 2048 and thanks to global warming, 90% of the world is underwater. Most people make a living by either exploiting the troubled people or by raiding the lost cities for valuables. The Kubiak family run one of these salvage operations and are asked by the Vatican to try and locate a scepter, one that legend says can reduce the water levels. The skeptical family agrees to the mission, only to find that they have competition from a familiar source. As I said, the story is a little out there, but it was fairly interesting. If this film had any kind of budget what-so-ever it may have worked, but it didn't. James Brolin stars in a role that he was too old for twenty-five years ago. The leader of the Kubiak family, a master salvager and adventurer is played by James Brolin?! That alone should have turned me off to this film. The other star is his troubled son, played by Ian Somerhalder of the Vampire Diaries, and while he was a little more charismatic than the rest of the cast, he can't do much to save this film. A strange thinly veiled story needs to have something besides beautiful people to back it up. If there had been some cool special effects or a more established supporting cast, this film could have been interesting. Instead it ends up being cheesy, and not the good kind of cheesy. At least films like Sharknado are good for a laugh, this is basically just another Waterworld, with less talent and an even lamer story.

I agree that the writing was not that great and could have been a whole lot better.  I will say this, the actors did well given what they had.  A lot more should have been done with the dialogue given to James Brolin and Ben Cross, because both deserved a damnsite better treatment than what they got for this.  I think it would have been better had the director let them edit some of their lines.I will say this for Ben Cross, he knows how to play a bad a** to the hilt--given the right dialogue.  His expressions and such were well carried out here, as were what lines he delivered. He does not short change his fans in this one--or in any other movie I have seen him in.  However, I will gripe when the writing is bad.Now for the storyline itself, it is good.  The plot is good.  If they do make a follow up to this, they need to bring Cross back as well as Somerhalder, and give these actors some lines with friggin' teeth in them!  You really don't know if Cross's character died or not the way that shot was set up so anything goes! Yes, I'm still complaining about the writing but I think Brolin and Cross's lines would have been delivered better had they been allowed some creative input because those two actors probably have more insight to offer than half the directors and producers they end up working for.
