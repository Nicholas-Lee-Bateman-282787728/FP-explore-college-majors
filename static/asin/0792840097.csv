145044,A36EW68H08UOCS,0792840097,"Mark J. Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[0, 0]","I was about halfway through Pen Densham's ""Moll Flanders"" when I realized the film I was watching was closer to a variation of Dicken's Oliver Twist with a female ""Oliver"" than to a story based on Daniel Dafoe's novel.I decided to try to enjoy the film on its own merit, and I didn't hate it.  Faint praise, I know, but I like period costume dramas with great production values and skilled performers, so I was mentally comparing this film to productions such as the recent series of Jane Austin based works, and this does not compare well toEmma,Pride and Prejudice -(A&E;, 1996)andSense & Sensibility (Special Edition).Moll has an Oliver-like pauper's birth, delivered by a woman who is saved from the gallows only for the duration of her pregnancy and hanged a few hours later.  Instead of a pitiless Dickens orphanage, Moll grows up in a nunnery where she is fondled by priests, and beaten by nuns after attacking a priest who gropes Moll in confession.  Tossed into the cruel streets Moll is taken in by a female Fagin stand-in, Mrs. Allworthy, proprietress of a bordello which counts politicians and clergy amongst its clientele.Moll is portrayed by Robin Wright, and there's more of Forrest Gump's Jenny in her performance than in her portrayal of Princess Buttercup.  Moll is more than the clich&eacute;d prostitute with a heart of gold.  She tries to maintain some degree of personal integrity and justice, and she's the kind of woman who will take a beating to protect a friend.Mrs. Allworthy is portrayed by Stockard Channing, and she makes the character a believable upper crust madam, able to move amongst the politically mighty, but also knowing why men visit her establishment.Moll is given food and shelter, but she sinks lower in self esteem in her work. Arriving at the house a virgin, Mrs. Allworthy auctions Moll's virtue for a small fortune.  Not long after a man arrives wanting to buy time with the least expensive woman available.  Mrs. Allworthy charges half a crown for Moll, then chides them both, doubting that Moll will give the man his money's worth.The man is a painter, played by John Lynch, and he wants a real live woman not for sex, but to paint and learn more about anatomy.  This begins a new era in Moll's life.Until the Hollywood ending, the entire movie is told in Forrest Gump-like flashbacks, with Morgan Freeman reading to Moll's nine-year old daughter, played by Aisling Corcoran, from Moll's personal journal.  Freeman carries a degree of authority and respect to the proceedings as Mr. Hibble.  Moll initially meets Hibble where he is working for Mrs. Allworthy, and she gains his trust and devotion when she discovers him in an indelicate moment and takes punishment herself rather than betray his secret.This film may have been more.

Take a movie adaptation like &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; (with Demi Moore) or &quot;Queen of the Damned&quot; (with Aaliyah)--those are horrible adaptations of great books.  This movie, however, is a good story in its own right, and not really an adaptation at all.  The acting is good, the sets and costumes are pretty, and the plot, while not life changing, is moving and interesting.My advice: 1)Read the book.  2)Watch the Masterpiece Theatre adaptation.  3)Watch this version, but keep an open mind and don't expect to see the same story that you read in the novel.",4,"Read the book, but don't cast this movie aside!",1045094400,"02 13, 2003",2003,996,"['first', 'read', '*book*', 'Moll', 'Flanders', 'when', 'was', 'eighth', 'grade', 'loved', 'Then', 'saw', 'Masterpiece', 'Theatre', 'adaptation', 'novel', 'loved', 'When', 'saw', 'title', 'video', 'store', 'thought', ""'d"", 'give', 'try.First', 'off', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'stated', 'nothing', 'novel', 'save', 'name', 'main', 'character', 'quot', 'quot', 'HOWEVER', 'story', 'not', 'bad', 'Take', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'quot', 'Scarlet', 'Letter', 'quot', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'quot', 'Queen', 'Damned', 'quot', 'Aaliyah', 'are', 'horrible', 'adaptations', 'great', 'books', 'movie', 'however', 'good', 'story', 'own', 'right', 'not', 'really', 'adaptation', 'acting', 'good', 'sets', 'costumes', 'are', 'pretty', 'plot', 'not', 'life', 'changing', 'moving', 'interesting.My', 'advice', '1', 'Read', 'book', '2', 'Watch', 'Masterpiece', 'Theatre', 'adaptation', '3', 'Watch', 'version', 'keep', 'open', 'mind', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'see', 'same', 'story', 'read', 'novel']",N/A

If you want a tale of poverty, abuse, love, and redemption give it a shot. I think you will enjoy it. The cast is absolutely FANTASTIC. Each player was perfection. The story looks like life. We may not be in those times or have those backgrounds, but who doesn't know love, betrayal, hope, desperation? They all carry out their parts to a tee! The costumes and settings are perfect. When you are surrounded by poverty, you can almost smell the stench, feel the sickness and hunger. When you are among the rich, you can feel the comfort and decadence. It's a rollicking good period piece. Enjoy it.",5,"Okay, so it's nothing like the book...",1394928000,"03 16, 2014",2014,675,"['want', 'visual', 'rendering', 'book', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'not', 'want', 'tale', 'poverty', 'abuse', 'love', 'redemption', 'give', 'shot', 'think', 'will', 'enjoy', 'cast', 'absolutely', 'FANTASTIC', 'player', 'was', 'perfection', 'story', 'life', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'times', 'have', 'backgrounds', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'love', 'betrayal', 'hope', 'desperation', 'carry', 'out', 'parts', 'tee', 'costumes', 'settings', 'are', 'perfect', 'When', 'are', 'surrounded', 'poverty', 'can', 'almost', 'smell', 'stench', 'feel', 'sickness', 'hunger', 'When', 'are', 'rich', 'can', 'feel', 'comfort', 'decadence', 'rollicking', 'good', 'period', 'piece', 'Enjoy']",N/A
