753735,A3DGB4HN3QCGAL,B00009K77X,A. Burchfield,"[23, 29]","I managed to miss much of this program during it's airings on PBS so when I saw it was due out on DVD I decided to get it. I like the concept of taking a modern day family and dropping them into an earlier time setting but this mini-series seemed to me like it lacks something. As in the earlier ""1900 House"" a target home was selected and restored to period function, here all details of that are left out. I would also have liked seeing/hearing more about the family/servant selection process, you get a little of that in watching the program. I found it interesting to watch but think an hour or so at a time is enough for me. Both ""1900 House"" and ""Manor House"" have companion books, you'll want it for this series especially to get a good backgrounding on what is going on.I haven't gotten through it all yet but saw that the Oliff-Cooper family took to their roles a little too well to suit the servants. The servants brought out one of the most glaring problems in the cast selection process, the producers appear to have sometimes done a terrible job in selection. The first scullery maid candidate was an 18 yr. old who had no idea what she was getting into, she took off after just two days. I think the 2nd one did better but it took three tries to get one who could take the job, how could the selection process have been so badly managed? That lowest ranking manservant was a real prize too, seemed to resent the more privileged types way too much. All, or nearly all, of the others did quite well in what I've seen of the story. There's a two part diary included on Disc #1, I watched part one and thought it as interesting, if not more, than the program itself. Apparently they were filming around Sept. 11, 2001 because a couple of the cast made nice references to the tragedy.The program is interesting to watch but you'll need to get the book, Amazon has it, as a companion guide- it's much better than the book for ""1900 House"".The onscreen menu could use a little help I think, or a resonably large TV screen to watch the show on. I've tried it out on a small portable Sony DVD player, the show looks just fine but the menu requires a larger screen to read it well. I could read everything adequately but when changing menu selections the color shift on moving from one choice to another wasn't good enough to tell where you were, that's why you either need a bigger screen or PBS needed to make the menu larger or color changing.",3,"3 1/2 stars, slow going, interesting, tho lacking details",1082851200,"04 25, 2004",2004,2450,"['managed', 'miss', 'much', 'program', 'airings', 'PBS', 'when', 'saw', 'was', 'due', 'out', 'DVD', 'decided', 'get', 'concept', 'taking', 'modern', 'day', 'family', 'dropping', 'earlier', 'time', 'setting', 'mini-series', 'seemed', 'something', 'earlier', '1900', 'House', 'target', 'home', 'was', 'selected', 'restored', 'period', 'function', 'here', 'details', 'are', 'left', 'out', 'would', 'also', 'have', 'liked', 'seeing/hearing', 'more', 'family/servant', 'selection', 'process', 'get', 'little', 'watching', 'program', 'found', 'interesting', 'watch', 'think', 'hour', 'so', 'time', 'enough', '1900', 'House', 'Manor', 'House', 'have', 'companion', 'books', ""'ll"", 'want', 'series', 'especially', 'get', 'good', 'backgrounding', 'what', 'going', 'on.I', 'have', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'yet', 'saw', 'Oliff-Cooper', 'family', 'took', 'roles', 'little', 'too', 'well', 'suit', 'servants', 'servants', 'brought', 'out', 'one', 'most', 'glaring', 'problems', 'cast', 'selection', 'process', 'producers', 'appear', 'have', 'sometimes', 'done', 'terrible', 'job', 'selection', 'first', 'scullery', 'maid', 'candidate', 'was', '18', 'yr.', 'old', 'who', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'getting', 'took', 'off', 'just', 'two', 'days', 'think', '2nd', 'one', 'did', 'better', 'took', 'three', 'tries', 'get', 'one', 'who', 'could', 'take', 'job', 'how', 'could', 'selection', 'process', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'badly', 'managed', 'lowest', 'ranking', 'manservant', 'was', 'real', 'prize', 'too', 'seemed', 'resent', 'more', 'privileged', 'types', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'nearly', 'others', 'did', 'quite', 'well', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'story', 'two', 'part', 'diary', 'included', 'Disc', '1', 'watched', 'part', 'one', 'thought', 'interesting', 'not', 'more', 'program', 'Apparently', 'were', 'filming', 'around', 'Sept.', '11', '2001', 'couple', 'cast', 'made', 'nice', 'references', 'tragedy.The', 'program', 'interesting', 'watch', ""'ll"", 'need', 'get', 'book', 'Amazon', 'companion', 'guide-', 'much', 'better', 'book', '1900', 'House', '.The', 'onscreen', 'menu', 'could', 'use', 'little', 'help', 'think', 'resonably', 'large', 'TV', 'screen', 'watch', 'show', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'out', 'small', 'portable', 'Sony', 'DVD', 'player', 'show', 'just', 'fine', 'menu', 'larger', 'screen', 'read', 'well', 'could', 'read', 'everything', 'adequately', 'when', 'changing', 'menu', 'selections', 'color', 'shift', 'moving', 'one', 'choice', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'enough', 'tell', 'where', 'were', 'why', 'either', 'need', 'bigger', 'screen', 'PBS', 'needed', 'make', 'menu', 'larger', 'color', 'changing']",N/A

Manor House swept me away.For those who don't know the House series does its best to transport modern people through time to live as they would have in earlier eras. In Manor House, one family, the Oliff-Coopers, will live as aristocracy in the Edwardian era in addition to a disparate group of people recruited to run the Manor House as its upper and lower servants. It is Upstairs/Downstairs as reality TV and it is brilliant.The Oliff-Coopers settle very quickly into their roles as to the manor born. The wife, a physician in the 21st century quickly loses herself in the doll-like persona of the era and even hints that her husband prefers her this way. The husband quickly believes that he deserves his higher position through some act of God rather than being a part of a social experiment. All believe that the servants enjoy waiting on them and averting their eyes when speaking. Both leave their young son to the care of the servants and Lady Oliff-Cooper's sister is the only member of the family to retain any sanity whatsoever in that she almost has a nervous breakdown because of the restrictions women of the time live under and has to leave the experiment. So much for Upstairs.Downstairs consists of work, more work and back-breaking work and you realize that these people are barely scratching the surface of the reality of servants in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. The French chef who values the challenge of the Edwardian cuisine hopes he can get through the summer without poisoning anyone because of the lack of refridgeration. A Scullery Maid turns out to be a position that is impossible to fill; two girls leave in tears despite the lure of a television appearance. The Butler struggles to handle exhausted and rebellious twenty-somethings and retain standards. Everyone is astonished by the amount of dirty work required to run a house in that era and the viewer understands why real establishments like this took dozens to hundreds of people to maintain them.Manor House is never boring and gives insight not only into the period but into human nature and why equality is such a hard won thing.

753738,A6JJ7CD3RN1W5,B00009K77X,a writer,"[6, 7]","The formula for the PBS ""House"" programs guarantees interesting viewing. ""Manor House"" is easily the best of the bunch; it combines an impressive setting, conventions from a bygone era and unpredictable human interaction into an absorbing experiment.Essentially, viewers can see how much life has changed since Edwardian times. People no longer have to work impossibly long hours as servants in someone else's mansion. Likewise, the prospect of living in the lap of luxury has also diminished with time. The program functions as super-condensed social history. By the end of the three month experiment, the lowest servants were chafing to get out of the house, while the privileged family were reluctant to leave. Along the way, we see how being a servant or a master affects people, and the conclusion is that Edwardian England (indeed, the whole Gilded Age) was doomed to wither anyway: the program proves it.I appreciated the insights of the butler, Mr Edgar - an indispensable person in the show. He nails the essential truth of ""Manor House"" with his sensitive and quietly forceful attitudes about work and reward. Discipline and hard work are necessary for success (upsetting Socialist hallboy Kenny's worldview), but people also need to be fairly compensated for their labor. ""Manor House"" judges anyone's views; it simply says, you can't push things too far either way.

What resulted was a three-month voyage away from the familiar into a life that was gritty for some, the height of luxury for others. Here scullery maids work pre-dawn to post-dusk scrubbing their hands raw, while footmen, cooks, maids, grooms and groundsmen toil with varying degrees of demanding labor. But at the heart of this hive of activity live the pampered gentry who (in the fiction created for the small screen) own the house and grounds, and from whom simultaneously much and very little is expected. Throughout the run-time of this series, various guests pay calls in order to push the storyline forward, including a real-life Indian prince.I thought this was a great series start to finish, and would even say at times it was engrossing with its cast drawn from the spectrum of modern British society. So real was this outing into the past made to seem that at one point Mrs. Oliff-Cooper, in actuality, of course, a twenty-first-century denizen, remarked that she had to keep reminding herself that her son was not one day going to inherit the house, grounds, servants, and all there. Yes, so real did it seem that I also found myself thinking of how sad that these likable people would shortly be confronted with the tragedy of the First World War.I'm always glad when new titles such as these are made, and think if anything, Manor House on DVD was under-priced.",5,Recreating Edwardian Country Life For A Variety Of Classes,1169164800,"01 19, 2007",2007,1857,"['such', 'other', 'projects', '1900', 'House', 'Regency', 'House', 'Party', 'experiment', 'living', 'history', 'psychology', 'also', 'extent', 'viewing', 'public', 'capable', 'broadening', 'definition', 'what', 'entertainment', 'here', 'tens', 'decade', 'reality', 'television', 'dominant.In', 'Manor', 'House', 'number', 'men', 'women', 'walks', 'life', 'own', 'time', 'were', 'set', 'environment', 'recreated', 'Edwardian', 'period', 'century', 'ago', 'What', 'resulted', 'was', 'three-month', 'voyage', 'away', 'familiar', 'life', 'was', 'gritty', 'height', 'luxury', 'others', 'Here', 'scullery', 'maids', 'work', 'pre-dawn', 'post-dusk', 'scrubbing', 'hands', 'raw', 'footmen', 'cooks', 'maids', 'grooms', 'groundsmen', 'toil', 'varying', 'degrees', 'demanding', 'labor', 'heart', 'hive', 'activity', 'live', 'pampered', 'gentry', 'who', 'fiction', 'created', 'small', 'screen', 'house', 'grounds', 'whom', 'simultaneously', 'much', 'very', 'little', 'expected', 'run-time', 'series', 'various', 'guests', 'pay', 'calls', 'order', 'push', 'storyline', 'forward', 'including', 'real-life', 'Indian', 'prince.I', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'series', 'start', 'finish', 'would', 'even', 'say', 'times', 'was', 'engrossing', 'cast', 'drawn', 'spectrum', 'modern', 'British', 'society', 'So', 'real', 'was', 'outing', 'past', 'made', 'seem', 'one', 'point', 'Mrs.', 'Oliff-Cooper', 'actuality', 'course', 'twenty-first-century', 'denizen', 'remarked', 'had', 'keep', 'reminding', 'son', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'day', 'going', 'inherit', 'house', 'grounds', 'servants', 'there', 'Yes', 'so', 'real', 'did', 'seem', 'also', 'found', 'thinking', 'how', 'sad', 'likable', 'people', 'would', 'shortly', 'be', 'confronted', 'tragedy', 'First', 'World', 'War.I', ""'m"", 'always', 'glad', 'when', 'new', 'titles', 'such', 'are', 'made', 'think', 'anything', 'Manor', 'House', 'DVD', 'was', 'under-priced']",N/A

In order to rule over them, they needed to believe they had happy servants -- but if they had rules like this in place, this tells me, deep down, they knew they didn't.What makes these shows so fascinating to watch is not just the educational aspect of it, but also the human motivational aspect of it.

In other words, ""Manor House"" tries to show the viewing audience what life was really like when the rich were viewed as ""very special"" and those that looked after them ""knew their place"" and thought it good to be working for them (the British class system of early 20th century).""Manor House"" the very wealthy ""upper class"" family and owners of the huge estate is the 21st century Copper family (consisting of Dad, mother and two sons plus the mother's spinster sister). The Mother (especially), dad and their kids take to the life of privilege, of course, easily and for three months seem to really enjoy having it all--people to do their bidding, fine wines,  hunting, fishing, planning many ""high society"" social events,  tons of people desiring their company because of their stations in life, etc.  Because of stringent protocol and ""status/place"" roles  of each member of the Edwardian household, the mother's sister does not take to her new position too well feeling isolated and very much alone--so much so that she leaves the estate for awhile and when at the Manor she has to form an  alliance with another ""looked down"" on member of the household, the East-Indian tutor of the youngest child of the Copper family.  The Indian tutor is neither considered ""upper class"" nor ""lower class"" and tends to whine a lot.  All that said, in comparison with the ""lower class"" working people down stairs, the upstairs folks had it rather easy and very little to complain about filling their days giving orders and in, to me, rather trivial pursuits,  The ""real"" action occurs downstairs.Bossed (more or less) by the head butler, the working class, downstairs crew have a very difficult time adjusting 21st century sensibilities to the early 20th century's  severe British class oriented sensibilities especially on an humongous estate with loads of work and severe isolation.  The Butler (who is responsible for the running of the house) has a very difficult time keeping the ""help"" doing what they are suppose to do and just being happy to serve. The ""acting"" Butler is, after all, of the 21st century and tries to apply some of today's standards to the workers.  This does NOT work for the Edwardian age.  Therefore, after losing staff and suffering insubordination, he with more success becomes somewhat of an early 1900s disciplinarian.  The butler still comes across as a basically nice person.I really enjoyed all of the episodes of ""Manor House"".  I certainly got some insight of what life was like for some in England in the early 1900s.(Being an amateur chef myself, I must add that ""my heart went out"" to the French chef in this series.  He was perceived by especially the downstairs group as being just irrational and temperamental.  In reality, he indeed was just trying to recreate the artery-clogging foods of the Edwardian era  kitchen which the upstairs people did not understand or appreciate offering him no support for his efforts.)",5,"Great ""reality TV"" at the beginning of the 20th century in England.",1332633600,"03 25, 2012",2012,3568,"['So', 'called', 'reality', 'TV', 'usually', 'not', 'favorite', 'form', 'entertainment', 'However', 'having', 'enjoyed', 'many', 'entertaining', 'hours', 'watching', 'presentations', 'set', 'Edwardian', 'era', 'and/or', 'early', '20th', 'century', 'such', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'Downstairs', 'Downton', 'Abby', 'Brides', 'head', 'Revisited', 'Maurice', 'et', 'al', 'was', 'intrigued', 'premise', 'Manor', 'House', 'modern', '21st', 'century', 'people', 'filling', 'playing', 'roles', 'upper', 'class', 'gentry', 'working', 'class', 'waited', 'hand', 'foot', 'trying', 'cope', 'huge', 'Edwardian', 'house', 'three', 'months', 'only', 'means', 'early', '1900s', 'modern', 'gadgets', 'other', 'words', 'Manor', 'House', 'show', 'viewing', 'audience', 'what', 'life', 'was', 'really', 'like', 'when', 'rich', 'were', 'viewed', 'very', 'special', 'looked', 'knew', 'place', 'thought', 'good', 'be', 'working', 'British', 'class', 'system', 'early', '20th', 'century', 'Manor', 'House', 'very', 'wealthy', 'upper', 'class', 'family', 'owners', 'huge', 'estate', '21st', 'century', 'Copper', 'family', 'consisting', 'Dad', 'mother', 'two', 'sons', 'mother', 'spinster', 'sister', 'Mother', 'especially', 'dad', 'kids', 'take', 'life', 'privilege', 'course', 'easily', 'three', 'months', 'seem', 'really', 'enjoy', 'having', 'people', 'do', 'bidding', 'fine', 'wines', 'hunting', 'fishing', 'planning', 'many', 'high', 'society', 'social', 'events', 'tons', 'people', 'desiring', 'company', 'stations', 'life', 'etc', 'stringent', 'protocol', 'status/place', 'roles', 'member', 'Edwardian', 'household', 'mother', 'sister', 'not', 'take', 'new', 'position', 'too', 'well', 'feeling', 'isolated', 'very', 'much', 'alone', 'so', 'much', 'estate', 'awhile', 'when', 'Manor', 'form', 'alliance', 'looked', 'down', 'member', 'household', 'East-Indian', 'tutor', 'youngest', 'child', 'Copper', 'family', 'Indian', 'tutor', 'neither', 'considered', 'upper', 'class', 'lower', 'class', 'whine', 'lot', 'said', 'comparison', 'lower', 'class', 'working', 'people', 'down', 'stairs', 'upstairs', 'folks', 'had', 'rather', 'easy', 'very', 'little', 'complain', 'filling', 'days', 'giving', 'orders', 'rather', 'trivial', 'pursuits', 'real', 'action', 'downstairs.Bossed', 'more', 'less', 'head', 'butler', 'working', 'class', 'downstairs', 'crew', 'have', 'very', 'difficult', 'time', 'adjusting', '21st', 'century', 'sensibilities', 'early', '20th', 'century', 'severe', 'British', 'class', 'oriented', 'sensibilities', 'especially', 'humongous', 'estate', 'loads', 'work', 'severe', 'isolation', 'Butler', 'who', 'responsible', 'running', 'house', 'very', 'difficult', 'time', 'keeping', 'help', 'doing', 'what', 'are', 'suppose', 'do', 'just', 'being', 'happy', 'serve', 'acting', 'Butler', '21st', 'century', 'tries', 'apply', 'today', 'standards', 'workers', 'NOT', 'work', 'Edwardian', 'age', 'Therefore', 'losing', 'staff', 'suffering', 'insubordination', 'more', 'success', 'somewhat', 'early', '1900s', 'disciplinarian', 'butler', 'still', 'basically', 'nice', 'person.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'episodes', 'Manor', 'House', 'certainly', 'got', 'insight', 'what', 'life', 'was', 'England', 'early', '1900s', 'Being', 'amateur', 'chef', 'must', 'add', 'heart', 'went', 'out', 'French', 'chef', 'series', 'was', 'perceived', 'especially', 'downstairs', 'group', 'being', 'just', 'irrational', 'temperamental', 'reality', 'indeed', 'was', 'just', 'trying', 'recreate', 'artery-clogging', 'foods', 'Edwardian', 'era', 'kitchen', 'upstairs', 'people', 'did', 'not', 'understand', 'appreciate', 'offering', 'support', 'efforts']",N/A

753752,A35L81CBN2Z8C0,B00009K77X,J. R. Neumiller,"[5, 5]","This one will draw you in like no other.The third installment of the ""House"" series, it has learned from 1900 house and 1940 house what to focus on and what not to. 1900 house is as much a story on how the environment was created as the actual daily life itself. It was very self-conscious and ""gimicky"" at times.1940 House does much better in simply focusing on the lives of the inhabitants. It is miles better than its predecessor, and you get much more wrapped up in the lives and situation of the times. This one really succeeds in transporting you back to WWII England and the trying difficulties the war imposed. Smashingly good.Manor House takes it to the next level in many ways. The group is much larger and encompasses many more levels of social strata - from the house owners and their children, to the servants and their respective roles. Additionally, the structure and local is vastly superior to the previous house series, it surely exceeds even the highest expectations for this particular setting.There are so many aspects wonderfully brought out in this series. The ""time machine"" effect is striking for all involved, and is handled the most naturally by everyone involved. The entire setting is simply so powerful and established - it requires very little imagination or suspension of disbelief. Many participants remarked openly on how quickly the lifestyle changes were assimilated. Even the lady of the house - a 21st century doctor in her own right! - is utterly conformed by the structure and societal expectations of the time. Its amazing to watch.A word has to be said about the unsung star of the series - the Manor House itself, Manderston. This historic house is perhaps the finest surviving example of Edwardian architecture - specifically built to showcase the opulence of the age. It is over 100 years old and yet is every bit as massive and ornate as it appears in the series. A finer house could not have been selected for this show.What is utterly stunning, (to me,) is the authenticity of the interior and its fixtures. You don't really notice at first the checkerboard tile pattern in the kitchen area, or the wood stoves in the kitchen; the plumbing fixtures in the bathrooms and the servant bell system in the hallway. They are utterly authentic in every detail - which is completely astounding when you consider how this could be. Surely a lot of work was done to restore the house to period condition, and it is utterly flawless. The show would not have worked as well without the establishment of this house.You will marvel and delight in the cast and their relationships, which are very real and authentic. Though the 21st is always not far from their thoughts, the the reality of their manor house life created a gravity that could not be faked or denied. This was a social experiment of a grand scale and worked delightedly well. Timeless in its appeal, you can watch this for years and always get something new from it; its lessons and experiences are ever fruitful.A word about Mr. Edgar - I was most impressed by this man and his mission. He is the centerpiece and focal point of the series. He arrives first and leaves last. It is more ""his house"" than even the owners, (who are really just prisoners of the resulting gilded cage.) He is responsible for *everything* that goes on in the house. Though his title is ""Butler,"" he is the major domo, chief liaison, personal confidant, scheduler and supervisor of every aspect of the house and events. He is THE cog that makes the entire show work so well. The things he reveals in candor, the way he manages issues - firm at first, yet gentle and kindhearted to those that fall. He becomes the father figure for the staff, and is the chief reason why the group is so closely knit. A man of lesser character or commitment would not have done as well.For that matter, the casting for the show is excellent all around. 1900 house had problems with the family members that never got resolved. (The eldest daughter ""quit"" half-way through.) A couple of scullery maids vamoose early in the series, (understandably,) but that adds to the reality of the setting. Scullery maids surely had the highest turnover of any position because of the grueling and demanding work. When they find Ellen, (a young woman accustomed to hard work,) she fits in very well, (and goes on to have a very entertaining affair with the Hall Boy, Kenny.)I consider this effort smashingly good on every level. It simply could not have been executed any better. The producers deserve extremely high praise for the reality they created, (their experience with previous house series pays off big with this one.)11 out of 10 stars.",5,WONDERFUL!,1306800000,"05 31, 2011",2011,4689,"['one', 'will', 'draw', 'other.The', 'third', 'installment', 'House', 'series', 'learned', '1900', 'house', '1940', 'house', 'what', 'focus', 'what', 'not', '1900', 'house', 'as', 'much', 'story', 'how', 'environment', 'was', 'created', 'actual', 'daily', 'life', 'was', 'very', 'self-conscious', 'gimicky', 'times.1940', 'House', 'much', 'better', 'simply', 'focusing', 'lives', 'inhabitants', 'miles', 'better', 'predecessor', 'get', 'much', 'more', 'wrapped', 'up', 'lives', 'situation', 'times', 'one', 'really', 'transporting', 'back', 'WWII', 'England', 'trying', 'difficulties', 'war', 'imposed', 'Smashingly', 'good.Manor', 'House', 'next', 'level', 'many', 'ways', 'group', 'much', 'larger', 'many', 'more', 'levels', 'social', 'strata', 'house', 'owners', 'children', 'servants', 'respective', 'roles', 'Additionally', 'structure', 'local', 'vastly', 'superior', 'previous', 'house', 'series', 'surely', 'even', 'highest', 'expectations', 'particular', 'setting.There', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'aspects', 'wonderfully', 'brought', 'out', 'series', 'time', 'machine', 'effect', 'striking', 'involved', 'handled', 'most', 'naturally', 'everyone', 'involved', 'entire', 'setting', 'simply', 'so', 'powerful', 'established', 'very', 'little', 'imagination', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'Many', 'participants', 'remarked', 'openly', 'how', 'quickly', 'lifestyle', 'changes', 'were', 'assimilated', 'Even', 'lady', 'house', '21st', 'century', 'doctor', 'own', 'right', 'utterly', 'conformed', 'structure', 'societal', 'expectations', 'time', 'amazing', 'watch.A', 'word', 'be', 'said', 'unsung', 'star', 'series', 'Manor', 'House', 'Manderston', 'historic', 'house', 'perhaps', 'finest', 'surviving', 'example', 'Edwardian', 'architecture', 'specifically', 'built', 'showcase', 'opulence', 'age', '100', 'years', 'old', 'yet', 'bit', 'massive', 'ornate', 'series', 'A', 'finer', 'house', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'selected', 'show.What', 'utterly', 'stunning', 'authenticity', 'interior', 'fixtures', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'notice', 'first', 'checkerboard', 'tile', 'pattern', 'kitchen', 'area', 'wood', 'stoves', 'kitchen', 'plumbing', 'fixtures', 'bathrooms', 'servant', 'bell', 'system', 'hallway', 'are', 'utterly', 'authentic', 'detail', 'completely', 'astounding', 'when', 'consider', 'how', 'could', 'be', 'Surely', 'lot', 'work', 'was', 'done', 'restore', 'house', 'period', 'condition', 'utterly', 'flawless', 'show', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'worked', 'as', 'well', 'establishment', 'house.You', 'will', 'marvel', 'delight', 'cast', 'relationships', 'are', 'very', 'real', 'authentic', '21st', 'always', 'not', 'far', 'thoughts', 'reality', 'manor', 'house', 'life', 'created', 'gravity', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'faked', 'denied', 'was', 'social', 'experiment', 'grand', 'scale', 'worked', 'delightedly', 'well', 'Timeless', 'appeal', 'can', 'watch', 'years', 'always', 'get', 'something', 'new', 'lessons', 'experiences', 'are', 'ever', 'fruitful.A', 'word', 'Mr.', 'Edgar', 'was', 'most', 'impressed', 'man', 'mission', 'centerpiece', 'focal', 'point', 'series', 'first', 'last', 'more', 'house', 'even', 'owners', 'who', 'are', 'really', 'just', 'prisoners', 'resulting', 'gilded', 'cage', 'responsible', '*everything*', 'house', 'title', 'Butler', 'major', 'domo', 'chief', 'liaison', 'personal', 'confidant', 'scheduler', 'supervisor', 'aspect', 'house', 'events', 'cog', 'entire', 'show', 'work', 'so', 'well', 'things', 'candor', 'way', 'issues', 'firm', 'first', 'yet', 'gentle', 'kindhearted', 'fall', 'father', 'figure', 'staff', 'chief', 'reason', 'why', 'group', 'so', 'closely', 'knit', 'man', 'lesser', 'character', 'commitment', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'done', 'well.For', 'matter', 'casting', 'show', 'excellent', 'around', '1900', 'house', 'had', 'problems', 'family', 'members', 'never', 'got', 'resolved', 'eldest', 'daughter', 'quit', 'half-way', 'couple', 'scullery', 'maids', 'vamoose', 'early', 'series', 'understandably', 'reality', 'setting', 'Scullery', 'maids', 'surely', 'had', 'highest', 'turnover', 'position', 'grueling', 'demanding', 'work', 'When', 'find', 'Ellen', 'young', 'woman', 'accustomed', 'hard', 'work', 'very', 'well', 'have', 'very', 'entertaining', 'affair', 'Hall', 'Boy', 'Kenny', 'consider', 'effort', 'smashingly', 'good', 'level', 'simply', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'executed', 'better', 'producers', 'deserve', 'extremely', 'high', 'praise', 'reality', 'created', 'experience', 'previous', 'house', 'series', 'big', 'one', '11', '10', 'stars']",N/A

The time period is the turn of the last Century.  The servants are divided into two groups, the upper servants who interact with the family, and the lower servants who are not seen.  In fact, if they run into a family member during their duties they sometimes stand in the corner and pretend not to be there.  The Butler is Mr. Edgar who seems to be the most interesting person on the whole show.His grandfather was also a Butler and Mr. Edgar seems to have absorbed much of the ideals, or at least character, of his grandfather.  Silent, strong, never seeming to step out of character, he is a refreshing change to many of the whining 21st Century people who are always stepping out of their position in the shows to prove how much of a HERO they are.  BLAH!I can't decide if the Tutor had real problems or was just paranoid because I barely get to see him.  He appears on and off.  I don't remember seeing him in half the episodes.I kind of liked the Chef.  He was hyper and anger half the time but he seemed to know his stuff and sometimes had interesting insight.Most of the people in the Manor House stay in character as best they can.  Or they leave.  A few, like Mr. Edgar, were truly focused on doing their best and learning.  The family, the Olliff-Cooper family, seem to step into the roles without a problem.  Funny enough, while they do show some insight during their time there I think only the two sons really come away with any real insight.  I think Jonathan got the most out of it.There is romance, parties, a lovely house, humor, sadness, and even a ghost - but that could be somebody just freaking out in a new house.  Yes, there is a romance between two of the servants but you wonder how much of the bond was real love or the pressure of working in such a setting - fighting the system, the hard work, the need for somebody to turn to with their troubles.  Once they left the Manor, into the real world, would the relationship hold?

Others in the series are ""Frontier House"" and ""Colonial House"", etc.  What happens is, a group of modern-day people, (NOT actors), dress up in the clothes, and live, (as nearly as possible), the lives of people during a past era.""Manor House"" stands out in my mind for ssevral reasons.  As the ""action"" of the story here is in the 1900s, it is the nearest in time to our own, (unlike ""Colonial House"", or ""Frontier House"".  Also, I remember that the woman playing the ""Lady of the Manor"" is, in real life, a Medical Docror, (MD).  She enjoyed playing the role of ""Lady of the Manor"" SO much, that at the end, she says it would be nice to continue as such.  Also, amongst the other ""actors"" in this series, a REAL-LIFE romance bloossomed, and, at the end of the series, these two people, (I shant tell you which ones!), decided to get married in their actual, late 20th century - early 21st century, lives.This series is flawlessly done, and really does take the viewer into this era.And, unlike compainion PBS series, like ""Frontier House"" and ""Colonial House"",the life-style in the Grand Homes of England, (and elsewhere where dwell the rich and famous), often do, (on perhaps a much-modified scale), still exist, (in REAL reality), today.Another PBS program proved this fact, beyond all doubt.  Ir was called 'COUNTRY HOUSE', or ""A COUNTRY HOUSE"", and showed the workings of a modern English estate.It was a fascinating REAL slice of aristocratic life, as lived in the late 20th-early 21st century.  The part I remember most was when one of the tenant's children became ill, and needed to go to hospital -- and have an operation, if I remember correecty.  The owner of the estate paid for all expenses for this hospital stay and operation.I do hope that (""A COUNTRY HOUSE', or just ""COUNTRY HOUSE""), is available on DVD -- or even VHS. For THIS is ""reality-reality"", and truly shows what is being done in MODERN manor houses -- today.

I liked most of the cast, in particular, Mr. Edwards and Antonia. I disliked Kenny. I found him annoying and his hairstyle anachronistic. His affair with Ellen was boring and took up valuable screen time. I thought the housekeeper Mrs. Davies was a weak character who did not assert herself or have much of a role. As housekeeper she'd have been more involved with the female staff and their discipline. The tutor character Mr. Singh was quite whiny. Instead of complaining about the `barriers' he felt, he should've focused more attention on seeing his pupil excel. A good rapport with his pupil would've ensured him a good reference and helped his social status.  The third housemaid added after the departure of the second scullery maid was not featured at all.  Ms. Aniston was a useless character (which was the point), but I would've liked her to do something such as shop, go to the theater or develop a hobby or two. She was bored and depressed most of the time which was boring and depressing. Perhaps another character would've been more interesting.I would've liked to see the servants at leisure. I'd also liked to see a servants outing, perhaps to the beach in old-fashioned bathing costumes. We never got to see the servants at bedtime or doing any hobbies such as mending, darning, or anything.

753765,A34D9Q0JTF7N7K,B00009K77X,Susan,"[13, 41]","We saw this at the library and brought it home just the other day. We have previously watched other ""House"" shows from the library too...Frontier, 1900's, and the WW2 one. I guess my honest opinion, especially after watching Manor House, is that this thing has been done enough already and who wants to keep on watching people complaining about every little thing? It seems these shows focus so much on the people complaining and how they can't get along with each other or can't cope. Obviously, I think the ones in charge must purposely choose people they know won't cope well so as to give ""entertainment"" value to the program. In each of these shows I feel I could have coped without all the pity parties and feeling sorry for myself and longing for what I can't have for these few months in this ""different"" life. And I know many people who could have easily breezed through these lifestyles with cheerful hearts and thankfulness for the opportunity to be able to be a part of such a special experience.As for this Manor House...I myself would have preffered to be one of the servants rather than the ""served"". Yes, I would rather empty someone's chamber pot than have someone empty mine. I think it would have been fun to be there 3 months to see what it was like to really be a servant. I like to clean, I like to do dishes, I like to cook, and while I admit that it would have been harder work than what I do in my own life, I think I could have done it and been happy all the while.I thought the show just focused on the negatives, and it gets tiring hearing people complain and listening to them yelling at each other. It all showed the selfishness that is so prevalent in today's youth (and even not so young)due to living in today's self serving society. Obviously, none of those young people could get beyond themselves to say, ""What can I do to help you, to make it easier for the whole group?"" I don't think any of them have ever really had to work. It was sad to see young men so selfish and lazy. Also I got tired of the bad words  and the not-necessary-to-be-spoken-about topics brought up. In our family we don't have TV; we only watch videos and DVD's we try to carefully choose. So we are not watching modern stuff and so we are a bit out of touch with today's low standards in topics of and way of conversation. There were many places where I had to put the mute button on because of tasteless discussion.I must admit it did have educational value; I know my children and I learned something about the Edwardian life from this program. I just think it could have been way better if there were better chosen people for the task. Really, when you go into a program to be a servant, what do you expect? Are you that dim witted that you don't equate servant with work? I am not saying here that servants should have been treated badly; they are people too that deserve respect and even honor for their service. In my opinion, one who can serve another with love will always be a greater person than one who cannot lower himself to serve.I must say I wasn't very interested in the Upstairs family. They seemed sort of boring. Maybe too because the show didn't really give a lot of attention to what exactly they were doing all day. It seemed the focus was on the Downstairs folks and their problems. I found the young boy of the family to be very annoying. I was surprised to hear the mother say the Edwardian life was not good for a boy. I couldn't believe it! Here that boy had a chance to be in a beautiful outdoor setting, experience so much of nature, ride horses, etc. That was such a real and good life for a child. The problem wasn't that the Edwardian life wasn't good for him,the problem was that his 21st century life has probably killed the real boy spirit inside him, as you can see in most children of today. Overall, I felt this show didn't give a good view of the family life as say 1900's House or the WW2 House.Of the servants, I felt the butler, the wife's maid, and the main housekeeper woman were the best, most decent people. I didn't like the personality of the cook, yet I appreciated that he really did work hard to do his best. I felt he really should have had another cook to help him. It seemed he was very overworked and had a lot on his shoulders. It is ""easy"" to clean, compared to the stress to make sure all the food you prepare for a dinner party is perfect. I was amazed at what he did in that old style kitchen. We were interested to see how birds were brought in and needed plucking, how the dead deer were brought in to be skinned, and to see the boar's head and suckling pig meals. I was surprised to see that Sir John thought the meal of the boar's head was some sort of slam to him. I didn't see that at all and felt he was reading too much into some things. I wonder, like my one daughter said, if any of these people will be embarrassed later when they watch the show? My children were perceptive to the childishness of the attitudes and actions of most of the people here.In conclusion, I would say this wasn't a total waste of time, but it was quite disappointing. If you have young children, I caution that you preview it first so you know where to skip and or mute certain scenes. But really you aren't going to miss much if you just choose not to watch it at all. I hear there is a book about this project? Perhaps that would be a better option.",2,Not very good,1132272000,"11 18, 2005",2005,5410,"['saw', 'library', 'brought', 'home', 'just', 'other', 'day', 'have', 'previously', 'watched', 'other',
