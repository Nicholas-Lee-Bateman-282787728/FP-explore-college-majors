44540,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0783201672,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","Ron Howard, the king of schmaltz, surprisingly DOESN'T layer this early effort with saccharine embarrassment.  Instead, he kind of develops a really interesting and entertaining coming of age romance involving two very different souls venturing from troubled Ireland to the America's during the 1800's land giveaway in Oklahoma.  With such control over development, this cult classic really builds a believable love story where opposites attract in a way that never feels forced or gimmicky.I'm really shocked I love this movie as much as I do.Tom Cruise stars as Joseph Donnelly, a young poor boy living with his father and two brothers.  He's a little guy, but tough as nails and when his father dies and some wealthy landowners burn down his home he sets off to set matters right.  His plans backfire when he meets the daughter of that landowner, the beautiful Shannon, a girl with modern ideas stuck in a world where she is boxed into a very aged society.  She sees Joseph as her escape and together they run off to better their lives in America.  America isn't as inviting as they initially expected it to be, and when Joe falls in with an underground scene of criminal boxers he becomes the talk of the town until his passions for Shannon cloud his judgment and soon the pair is left to fend for themselves in the most drastic of circumstances.Despite a really shoddy accent from Mr. Cruise (it may be near accurate, but it feels fake on his tongue) and a preposterously horrid performance by Barbara Babcock (she's always terrible), this film excels thanks to a beautifully woven story that is dramatic, romantic and cleverly whimsy (the ending is perfect) and a marvelously centered performance from Kidman and some sharp direction from Howard, not to mention the beautiful cinematography.  It is just a great watch that balances entertaining and poignant at the same time, building a real `story' and never forgetting to engage the audience in something they want to see.Forget about the fact that Tom Cruise is dressed like an overweight lesbian in the final Oklahoma race sequence, this film is oddly perfect.",5,Far and away better than I ever expected it to be!,1360108800,"02 6, 2013",2013,2120,"['Ron', 'Howard', 'king', 'schmaltz', 'surprisingly', 'DOES', ""N'T"", 'layer', 'early', 'effort', 'saccharine', 'embarrassment', 'Instead', 'kind', 'develops', 'really', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'coming', 'age', 'romance', 'involving', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'souls', 'venturing', 'troubled', 'Ireland', 'America', '1800', 'land', 'giveaway', 'Oklahoma', 'such', 'control', 'development', 'cult', 'classic', 'really', 'believable', 'love', 'story', 'where', 'attract', 'way', 'never', 'feels', 'forced', 'gimmicky.I', ""'m"", 'really', 'shocked', 'love', 'movie', 'as', 'much', 'do.Tom', 'Cruise', 'stars', 'Joseph', 'Donnelly', 'young', 'poor', 'boy', 'living', 'father', 'two', 'brothers', 'little', 'guy', 'tough', 'nails', 'when', 'father', 'dies', 'wealthy', 'landowners', 'burn', 'down', 'home', 'set', 'matters', 'right', 'plans', 'backfire', 'when', 'daughter', 'landowner', 'beautiful', 'Shannon', 'girl', 'modern', 'ideas', 'stuck', 'world', 'where', 'boxed', 'very', 'aged', 'society', 'Joseph', 'escape', 'together', 'run', 'off', 'better', 'lives', 'America', 'America', ""n't"", 'as', 'inviting', 'initially', 'expected', 'be', 'when', 'Joe', 'underground', 'scene', 'criminal', 'boxers', 'talk', 'town', 'passions', 'Shannon', 'cloud', 'judgment', 'soon', 'pair', 'left', 'fend', 'most', 'drastic', 'circumstances.Despite', 'really', 'shoddy', 'accent', 'Mr.', 'Cruise', 'may', 'be', 'near', 'accurate', 'fake', 'tongue', 'preposterously', 'horrid', 'performance', 'Barbara', 'Babcock', 'always', 'terrible', 'film', 'thanks', 'beautifully', 'woven', 'story', 'dramatic', 'romantic', 'cleverly', 'whimsy', 'ending', 'perfect', 'marvelously', 'centered', 'performance', 'Kidman', 'sharp', 'direction', 'Howard', 'not', 'mention', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'just', 'great', 'watch', 'entertaining', 'poignant', 'same', 'time', 'building', 'real', 'story', 'never', 'forgetting', 'engage', 'audience', 'something', 'want', 'see.Forget', 'fact', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'dressed', 'overweight', 'lesbian', 'final', 'Oklahoma', 'race', 'sequence', 'film', 'oddly', 'perfect']",N/A
44541,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,0783201672,Annie Van Auken,"[0, 0]","NOTE: This is NOT a DVD. It's a 12"" Laserdisc. These record album-sized predecessors of today's DVDs were visually superior. Until the advent of BluRay technology, Laserdiscs were the best digital format available.Set in the 1890s, Ron Howard's best picture is this lyric tale of two Irish immigrants, one wealthy (Kidman), one poor (Cruise), who leave home with almost nothing and come to the New World in search of modernity and free land. To reach Oklahoma and their ""destiny,"" first they must somehow survive Boston's mean slums.Tom Cruise is typically charming in FAR AND AWAY, but also quite convincing as a bare knuckles brawler who makes a decent living with his fists, until an unexpected defeat and the insulting of his sponsor cause Cruise and Kidman to be labeled persona non grata in that town. (The obvious chemistry between him and Miss Kidman really helps sell this romantic costumer.)Versatile character actor Robert Prosky is also believable as an Irish landlaird who follows his daughter to America when the family's stately home is ransacked and burned to the ground. He and Barbara Babcock seem well-matched as a long-married couple. Honorable mention for Clint Howard's portrayal of the villanous sweatshop foreman who sexually harr&aacute;sses Kidman right out of her miserable chicken plucker job.The Great Land Rush scene is particularly realistic thanks to the many hundreds of professional re-enactors that participated. Three of director Howard's great-grandparents were riders in this historic 1893 event.Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.(6.3) Far and Away (1992) - Nicole Kidman/Tom Cruise/Thomas Gibson/Robert Prosky/Barbara Babcock/Cyril Cusack/Colm Meany/Clint Howard/Brendan Gleeson/Rance Howard",5,"Shannon: ""Look, you've got your land."" --- Joseph: ""But all the land in the world means nothing to me without you.""",1298160000,"02 20, 2011",2011,1770,"['NOTE', 'NOT', 'DVD', '12', 'Laserdisc', 'record', 'album-sized', 'predecessors', 'today', 'DVDs', 'were', 'visually', 'superior', 'advent', 'BluRay', 'technology', 'Laserdiscs', 'were', 'best', 'digital', 'format', 'available.Set', '1890s', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'best', 'picture', 'lyric', 'tale', 'two', 'Irish', 'immigrants', 'one', 'wealthy', 'Kidman', 'one', 'poor', 'Cruise', 'who', 'leave', 'home', 'almost', 'nothing', 'come', 'New', 'World', 'search', 'modernity', 'free', 'land', 'reach', 'Oklahoma', 'destiny', 'first', 'must', 'somehow', 'survive', 'Boston', 'mean', 'slums.Tom', 'Cruise', 'typically', 'charming', 'FAR', 'AND', 'AWAY', 'also', 'quite', 'convincing', 'bare', 'brawler', 'who', 'decent', 'living', 'fists', 'unexpected', 'defeat', 'insulting', 'sponsor', 'cause', 'Cruise', 'Kidman', 'be', 'labeled', 'persona', 'non', 'grata', 'town', 'obvious', 'chemistry', 'Miss', 'Kidman', 'really', 'sell', 'romantic', 'costumer', 'character', 'actor', 'Robert', 'Prosky', 'also', 'believable', 'Irish', 'landlaird', 'who', 'daughter', 'America', 'when', 'family', 'stately', 'home', 'ransacked', 'burned', 'ground', 'Barbara', 'Babcock', 'seem', 'well-matched', 'long-married', 'couple', 'Honorable', 'mention', 'Clint', 'Howard', 'portrayal', 'villanous', 'sweatshop', 'foreman', 'who', 'sexually', 'harr', 'aacute', 'sses', 'Kidman', 'right', 'miserable', 'chicken', 'plucker', 'job.The', 'Great', 'Land', 'Rush', 'scene', 'particularly', 'realistic', 'thanks', 'many', 'hundreds', 'professional', 're-enactors', 'participated', 'Three', 'director', 'Howard', 'great-grandparents', 'were', 'riders', 'historic', '1893', 'event.Parenthetical', 'number', 'preceding', 'title', '1', '10', 'imdb', 'viewer', 'poll', 'rating', '6.3', 'Far', 'Away', '1992', 'Nicole', 'Kidman/Tom', 'Cruise/Thomas', 'Gibson/Robert', 'Prosky/Barbara', 'Babcock/Cyril', 'Cusack/Colm', 'Meany/Clint', 'Howard/Brendan', 'Gleeson/Rance', 'Howard']",N/A

44543,AYQP8XMHTG2YR,0783201672,Brandon J. Smith,"[2, 2]","Far and Away is a real gem. Along with Apollo 13, it is Ron Howard's finest film. The epic story takes us from Ireland to Boston to Oklahoma, and for over two hours the film hasn't a single dull moment. Cruise and Kidman breathe life into their characters, and Howard's direction keeps everything moving in appropriate fashion. That's the key to Howard's excellence as a director: He always puts the story first. The clothing, sets, cinematography: all serve the story.As with Apollo 13, everything builds to one heart-tugging moment at the climax of the film, and repeated viewings don't diminish the power of this moment one iota. In fact, seeing the film a second and third time only enhances the viewing experience, as the script is so well constructed. Everything from the characters' personal tics to ability to fight and ride horses is set up in the beginning of the film, and the growth and development of Joseph and Shannon flows logically from their life experiences.This edition of the dvd doesn't provide much in terms of features, but the sound and picture are terrific. In fact, the sound in particular is noteworthy, as the score does not overpower the dialogue. On most dvds, it always seems like the score and sound effects are twice as loud as the dialogue, so I'm constantly adjusting the volume. Not so with this dvd. I was able to watch and listen comfortably throughout.At the time, it seemed important that Cruise and Kidman were married. In the years to follow, of course, the real-life couple divorced, Kidman would make some pretty poor pictures, and Cruise seems to have gone totally nuts. But watching Far and Away, you forget all about that and get pulled completely into the film. This is a beautiful story, a wonderful film romance, and a great epic adventure. It's the absolute definition of a classic movie.

Stars Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman are engaging and have definite screen chemistry.  It's interesting to watch them in the early years of their relationship onscreen.

Kidman and he are totally believable as the romantic couple; although the rich girl/poor boy story is getting old, this one is done well. I liked the scenes of Ireland. New York is more persuasively depicted than by Scorsese's treatment of the same 'world' in his awful ""Gangs of New York"" which was operatic and overblown. Cruise is more believable as a boxer than DiCaprio, the better actor, who doesn't possess the physical energy Cruise has here. Overall, Howard is an intellectually less serious filmmaker than Scorsese, of course, so the film has that old-fashioned how-the-west-was-won look, which no doubt is why critics didn't love this; it's too optimistic for the sour-puss crowd who only like to see America bashed and mocked.

Yes.  Are there stunning visuals and wondrous feats of cinematography?  Absolutely.  Ron Howard knows how to create and mesh a well-made film.

It's uneven almost to the point of annoyance, and each scene meanders on until its replaced by the next disjointed scene.

It is simply beautiful with panning views of western Ireland, Atlantic ocean, Boston, and Oklahoma Territory.  There is no doubt the grand epic style of a love story is alive and well here.  That being said there are some problems in story line and too often inhibit the story's authentic historical story line. I got the feeling events were contrived to achieve a planned  outcome. In other words the story feels very much like pulling your leg fiction. After Shannon and Joseph reach Boston from Ireland, Cruise does a fine job as a bare fisted fighter.  Cruise is not a big man, but is powerful,lean, and quick, and takes out every challenger at the Social Club  except one; the Italian. In the process of defeating the Italian and within minutes of victory and winning a large sum of money, Joseph bolts off into the crowd because Shannon against her will is sitting on a councilman's knee.  As a result of this distraction he fowls up his footing and gets kidney punched.  Unable to fight further he loses a pile of money that could have sent them to Oklahoma.  Sorry I just don't buy it. A rematch might have helped everyone on the losing side.  After all Joseph was the better fighter.The story turns grim with the young couple (I guess they're a couple)gets evicted and robbed and has to fight for survival.  After days of starvation Shannon gets shot while she and Joseph break into a home.  Shannon amazingly ends up back with her family in Boston who have also come to America. This is a bit too coincidental. Joseph makes for the Ozarks though a blizzard.After Joseph finds employment and is lounging in his bunk he sees a wagon train passing by. He jumps off the train he is boarding, and with a hat and a bedroll he joins the wagon train.  What is the race a few miles down the road?  Needless to say he is unprepared for such a journey.The Oklahoma territory land rush is simply a thrill.  Hundreds of wagons, horsemen, even cycles line up. This is just excellent footage.After the gun sounds Wagons are skidding and flipping, horses stumbling, other debris sprawling along the course.  One of the most exciting moments in the land rush was Shannon and her horse hurdling a pile of debris as she bends forward for more speed.  The next sequence very badly strains credibility but it is also a declaration of love for Shannon and Joseph so rather than complain I will take my hat off to a grand old film.

It feels so much more real.  This is probably helped by the fact that Tom and Nicole were married then.  They interacted very well.  Part of what I personally like, too, is how Joseph (Tom) treats Shannon (Nicole) so tenderly - with the exception of dumping her in the bathtub fully clothed!  But he was definitely provoked!I was disappointed about the deleted scenes.  They didn't even have an option to see those scenes separately, like many dvds do.  Here are the ones I noticed.  Most importantly, the &quot;crazy Mick&quot; scenes were deleted.  You still see the explosions from making way for the railroad, but they left out the parts where the foreman needs someone to do a dangerous job, and asks for the &quot;crazy Mick&quot; (Joseph), because he has been willing to do it.  They deleted the scene where Joseph finds a job shoveling rocks and will work for less than the other men and then Shannon joins in and helps him (that was after they were kicked out of their room).  It showed their desperation and I'm sorry they left it out.  They deleted the scene where Shannon actually quits her work at the chicken factory and the workers applaud her.  They deleted the scene with Steven on the hilltop in Ireland writing a letter to Shannon although he doesn't know where to mail it and Shannon's father says something about hating to see a young man so miserable over love.  Nothing else of major importance was deleted.But they left so much in that is worth seeing.  You take the journey with Shannon and Joseph from Ireland to a cruise ship to the boxing matches in Boston to developing railroads to racing for land in the Oklahoma territory.  You journey with them from riches to poverty to wealth of a kind again.  You journey with them as they grow personally.

It starts in Ireland where the beginning of the rebellion of the Irish peasantry against the British landlords is depicted with a very acute sense of humanity. The Irish, and the British are shown, somewhere, to be both human and humane in spite of their historical differences. But the vision of Boston and later the Oklahoma Territory is amazing. None of the ugliness of poor immigrants in a country that exploits them to the extreme is spared and we are given a realistic picture of it, and of the tremendous social inequality and injustice in this puritan world. The race for land in the Oklahoma Territory is just as realistic and strong. Nothing is spared : shooting, cheating, fighting, bribing, etc. But what comes out strong in this film is the idea that a man or a woman are not human if they do not have a dream to possess land, cultivate it and prosper on it, if they are not ready to go through the direst ordeals to realize their dream, and if they are not ready to survive these ordeals and yet without a bad conscience, the bad conscience of not having respected  their opponents or challengers, not having remained humane and moral all along. Love is the real issue in this situation. One must never forget it and one must never drop this loving principle.

44574,A18OBUSMXVE8R0,0783201672,J. Guild,"[1, 1]","A movie classic is one that bears watching many times.This is such a movie.It reminds me of ""The Quiet Man"" in many ways.At first,I could not fathom Tom Cruise as a fierce Irishman ,nor Nicole Kidman playing the part of Protestant Irish Gentry;but what  marvelous performances they make in this epic.The story begins on the west coast of Ireland in 1892,when Joseph Donnelly ,a poor downtrodden farmer, in his early 20's, has had about all he can take from the brutal domination of the British Landlord system,and sees as his only hope for the future is to emigrate to America. At the other end of the social structure,Shannon Christie ,sees her priviliged life just as suffocating ,and also looks to America to start a new life.When I started to watch this movie,I had no idea whatsoever about it ,or its story. How I missed it several years back,I don't know.As it turned out,I an just as glad;because that is just the way to enjoy such a great epic,at least for me.Just sit back and let it all onfold.The scenes in Ireland are beautifully done. In a few shot minutes you really see how terrible the system was for the tenent farmers and how cruel the system was ,that had been imposed on them from England.Shortly, the story takes us to the slums of Boston where conditions were much as they were in New York; and we witnessed in the later movie of ""Gangs of New York"" or the novel ""Five Points."" The great actor ,Colm Meany, gives his usual magnificient perormance in the role of slum strongman,Kelly. Boy,I admire his work,even if I dislike the character he portrays in this movie.Within the year ,the story moves to the Ozark Mountains and finally to Oklahoma and the great Land Rush where their hopes for free land would be realized.What a great epic,all in about 2 years, and covering so much country.There are great characters ,you will come to love and hate.I have read and studied a lot of Irish history and dispora,but never did I see the Landlord portrayed in such a revealing way.All the landlords were not alike and many ,like Christie ,were as much prisoners to the British system as were the tenents. You will come to like him as much as O'Hara in ""Gone With the Wind"".With so much territory being covered,you would think that the story might drag;after all, the movie lasts for 2hours and 20 minutes. Such is not the case,it is so filled with action,emotions ans scenes,that are so good,that you will only wish that it could have lasted much longer.The scenes of the Oklahoma Land Rush are almost unbelievable and as good as any scenes of such magnitude and chaos that you will ever witness. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman show riding skills that are breathtaking;and if they weren'tperformed by the personally;it sure fooled me.I will be watching this wonderful epic over again;and will surely find many things I missed first time.",5,A man who does not have land of his own;has nothing.,1207440000,"04 6, 2008",2008,2848,"['movie', 'classic', 'one', 'watching', 'many', 'times.This', 'such', 'movie.It', 'Quiet', 'Man', 'many', 'ways.At', 'first', 'could', 'not', 'fathom', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'fierce', 'Irishman', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'playing', 'part', 'Protestant', 'Irish', 'Gentry', 'what', 'marvelous', 'performances', 'make', 'epic.The', 'story', 'west', 'coast', 'Ireland', '1892', 'when', 'Joseph', 'Donnelly', 'poor', 'downtrodden', 'farmer', 'early', '20', 'had', 'all', 'can', 'take', 'brutal', 'domination', 'British', 'Landlord', 'system', 'only', 'hope', 'future', 'emigrate', 'America', 'other', 'end', 'social', 'structure', 'Shannon', 'Christie', 'priviliged', 'life', 'just', 'suffocating', 'also', 'America', 'start', 'new', 'life.When', 'started', 'watch', 'movie', 'had', 'idea', 'whatsoever', 'story', 'How', 'missed', 'several', 'years', 'back', 'do', ""n't"", 'know.As', 'turned', 'out', 'just', 'glad', 'just', 'way', 'enjoy', 'such', 'great', 'epic', 'least', 'me.Just', 'sit', 'back', 'let', 'onfold.The', 'scenes', 'Ireland', 'are', 'beautifully', 'done', 'few', 'shot', 'minutes', 'really', 'see', 'how', 'terrible', 'system', 'was', 'tenent', 'farmers', 'how', 'cruel', 'system', 'was', 'had', 'been', 'imposed', 'England.Shortly', 'story', 'slums', 'Boston', 'where', 'conditions', 'were', 'much', 'were', 'New', 'York', 'witnessed', 'later', 'movie', 'Gangs', 'New', 'York', 'novel', 'Five', 'Points', 'great', 'actor', 'Colm', 'Meany', 'usual', 'magnificient', 'perormance', 'role', 'slum', 'strongman', 'Kelly', 'Boy', 'admire', 'work', 'even', 'dislike', 'character', 'movie.Within', 'year', 'story', 'Ozark', 'Mountains', 'finally', 'Oklahoma', 'great', 'Land', 'Rush', 'where', 'hopes', 'free', 'land', 'would', 'be', 'realized.What', 'great', 'epic', '2', 'years', 'covering', 'so', 'much', 'are', 'great', 'characters', 'will', 'come', 'love', 'hate.I', 'have', 'read', 'studied', 'lot', 'Irish', 'history', 'dispora', 'never', 'did', 'see', 'Landlord', 'portrayed', 'such', 'revealing', 'landlords', 'were', 'not', 'alike', 'many', 'Christie', 'were', 'as', 'much', 'prisoners', 'British', 'system', 'were', 'tenents', 'will', 'come', 'like', 'as', 'much', ""O'Hara"", 'Gone', 'Wind', 'so', 'much', 'territory', 'being', 'covered', 'would', 'think', 'story', 'might', 'drag', 'movie', '2hours', '20', 'minutes', 'Such', 'not', 'case', 'so', 'filled', 'action', 'emotions', 'ans', 'scenes', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'will', 'only', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'lasted', 'much', 'longer.The', 'scenes', 'Oklahoma', 'Land', 'Rush', 'are', 'almost', 'unbelievable', 'as', 'good', 'scenes', 'such', 'magnitude', 'chaos', 'will', 'ever', 'witness', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'show', 'riding', 'skills', 'are', 'breathtaking', ""weren'tperformed"", 'personally', 'sure', 'fooled', 'me.I', 'will', 'be', 'watching', 'wonderful', 'epic', 'again', 'will', 'surely', 'find', 'many', 'things', 'missed', 'first', 'time']",N/A

44576,AQ7V1UO19U1N9,0783201672,John Rossi,"[14, 18]","What can I say about this film to begin my review? Three words. I LOVE it. I may be a little biased, but I love things set in Ireland, Scotland, and that area. I was hooked immediately on the beautiful scenery of Ireland's west coast, and my heart was immediately stirred by the rich and dramatic, yet at times very soft and tender music. Even more so when I read ""Music By John Williams"" in the opening credits. But I digress.Music and scenery aside this movie still has much going for it, and it really shines. It's a love story yes, but it's beautiful. Others have mentioned the great chemistry between Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman here, and they are right. I am not a big fan of Tom Cruise (Rain Man was excellent though) or Nicole Kidman, but they played very well off each other. This film follows, again as many have mentioned, the two lead characters as they make a harrowing journey from Ireland to Boston to Oklahoma in pursuit of their dreams. His is ""I'll work my own land someday"" hers is ""I'm modern, and I'm going to a modern place"" She wants to get away from her parents old-fashioned and ""stuffy"" way of living.I hate to diss other films so I'll try not to do that here. I WILL say that I loved the love story in Far And Away because it works. And it works because it is given time to develop. Joseph and Shannon hate each others guts at first and make no secret of it, but they are drawn slowly together by the perils of their journey. It is touching to see their hatred for each other change from hatred to grudging respect, to affection, and finally grow all the way to genuine love. This works MUCH better than spending a day on a ship, and saying to yourself ""Oh look, there's a pretty girl up on the next deck. Let's take her dancing, partying, teach her how to spit, how to stand on the back of a ship with her eyes shut and her arms outstretched. Then I'll draw a nude portrait of her, and then we'll go and have sex in the back of a car. All witihin a period of about three or four days."" (Just for the record I loved Titanic too, but the ""quickie"" love story took away from the power of the film JUST a TAD because the love between Rose and Jack was not allowed to GROW and DEVELOP into itself as it is here in FAR AND AWAY. In TITANIC the love between Jack and Rose was just THERE. It was just: Boy meets girl. Girl meets boy. Boy loves girl. Girl loves boy. Badda-BING, Bada-BANG, Badda-BOOM)I'm sorry, I'm digressing again, so I'll try to keep to the point and keep the rest of this short. In summary , to me this film is a great one, well done in every part of the package. LOVELY scenery is wedded to absolutely beautiful music as two great actors are supported by an assortment of loveable aqquaintances and a couple of dastardly villians (I'm counting Mike Kelly here too, see the film to know who he is and why I call him a villian). All this comes together in a beautiful love story that has the power to touch the heart, and the tear ducts, and make you realize the importance of holding onto and going after your dreams. I loved it, and so can you, if you have the courage to let this film touch your heart. If you do allow that, it will carress it. Peace, and God bless you.

Not so in this movie.  I am not offended if they leave the God swear words out, but I AM offended if they (Hollywood) think it makes it a hot-shot, cool, liberated and child friendly movie.  Maybe their children/grandchildren are exposed to this kind of disrespect, but mine are not!

As I watched the movie progress, I almost felt sorry for Ron Howard.  This was a B rated movie, in my opinion, from the beginning (even without the God words).  Why do they use God's name (and His Son's) to swear by and never Buddha, Mohammed or even satan himself?The scenery (I love Ireland) was beautiful.  The storyline and acting were pitiful.  I could almost feel the struggle to make it work and I struggled with them.  I so enjoy period films, but this was a disappointment and was filed in my round file where all language like this belongs.

If you've seen their first movie together, Days Of Thunder, where they met and fell in love (big awwwwww everyone) then you'll know there's a lot of chemistry between them. However, in Far & Away, there's virtually no chemistry between them, and there's even less in their third & final film, Eyes Wide Shut.Before movies like Fight Club came along, there were some very graphic boxing scenes in this, bare knuckle fist-fighting, which makes you wince. Of course, there has to be a time the ex-lovely Tom doesn't win - and he gets really badly hurt.The Irish accents get a little dubious, especially when Tom starts yelling, you can totally hear his natural accent slipping through. The rest aren't so bad most of the time, but Tom's is almost as bad as Keanu Reeves' extremely bad English accent in Bram Stoker's Dracula.There are some very obvious sexual scenes between them, but the couple hardly kiss or anything - there's lots of naked butts (Tom's) and naked waists (Nicole's). But not much else. This could have been spiced up with some sex, but that was left for Eyes Wide Shut.There's also a very strange scene, which could be taken one way or the other. It's the scene after Joseph loses, and gets beaten up, and goes back to where he was staying with Shannon, and finds his ex-boss in the room with her. She's still dressed, but in tears, and it just hit me that something else could have happened. Maybe this wasn't the intention, maybe it's just my mind!There are some pretty cheesy lines in this, but you just ignore this, and watch the beautiful scenery and listen to the equally beautiful soundtrack.This isn't the best Tom & Nicole movie, due to lack of chemistry, and I definitely wouldn't recommend Eyes Wide Shut.

Infact this a completely inept film, what saves it from the fleapit misery of the 1 star rating is  its absolute inability to offend.Joseph Donelly (Tom Cruise) angry  about the rich landlord confiscating his father's land goes to shoot him  early on in the film, there he meets the landlord's free spirited daughter  Shannon (Nicole Kidman) and togather they decide to emmigrate to America  where they hear free land is being handed out. An early scene when Joseph's  father dies demonstrates how ludicrous this film is. The father is brought  in and assumed dead, Joseph kneels by his side in what looks like a  dramatic scene, his father then comes to, and tells his son that he thinks  him &quot;odd&quot;. This would have been fine in a comedy, but then  director Howard pulls the camera up, the music swells and we're expected to  be moved. Please. Infact the whole film is just as confused, neither an  epic drama, an action film or a comedy. It comes with the obligatory first  hate/then love relationship between its two leads. By the time you get to  the midsection where Joseph can't stop himself from punching everyone he  meets, this film starts to feel like a sitcom with an ego blown completely  out of proportion.Ron Howard has always been one to plays it safe, but  in doing so he has produced some decent films like Parenthood and Apollo  13, this time though he completely loses the reins. Any director who can  get a straight faced Nicole Kidman to ask &quot;Am I beautiful at  all?&quot; must be under the effect of controlled substances.Film  fans, and especially Amazon reviewers love to find fault with celebrated  films, and find something of worth in established turkeys like Far and  Away.

44597,A1J2931UBBJPXM,0783201672,Reviewer,"[8, 9]","In 1892 Ireland, the son of a poor farmer forms an unlikely alliance with the daughter of a wealthy landowner, in ""Far and Away,"" a romantic adventure directed by Ron Howard, and starring Tom Cruise and Nicole  Kidman.  When his father dies, and an agent of the landlord to whom back  rent is owed burns their modest home to the ground, Joseph Donnelly  (Cruise) vows revenge.  Armed with an ancient, rusty rifle,  he travels to  the estate of the landowner, Daniel Christie (Robert Prosky), intending to  shoot him.  But his plans to settle the score quickly go awry; as he draws  a bead on Christie and pulls the trigger, the rifle explodes in his face.  Christie takes him into his home to treat his wounds, and there Joseph  catches the eye of Christie's daughter, Shannon (Kidman).  The lad, she  notes, has pluck, and he's obviously a scrapper; and she immediately sees  him as the means by which she can effect her dream of running away to  America, where they are giving land away for free (or so says the ad she  has ripped from a newspaper).  She realizes that such an undertaking would  be impossible for a woman traveling alone, but with a man such as Joseph  along to tend to her needs and offer protection, it could be done.  Circumstances prevail in her favor, and soon the two of them are off,  covertly, with the plan being to land in Boston, then head west to the  Oklahoma Territory, where Shannon will be able to claim her land.  Of  course, Joseph sees land in it for himself, as well.  They hit a snag,  however, upon landing in Boston; Shannon's silver spoons, stolen from her  mother, and with which the trek west was to be financed, are stolen from  her, leaving them without means.  With some help, they manage to find  affordable accommodations (a room at a local bordello), and Shannon finds  work in a factory.  Meanwhile, Joseph finds he can make some money by  prizefighting at one of the local pubs, under sponsorship of a man named  Kelly (Colm Meaney), the ""connected"" Irishman of the town.  It's enough to  keep them going, temporarily, but the question is, can they make it to  Oklahoma in time for the ""land rush"" of 1893?  Cruise gives a  credible performance here as Joseph, complete with a passable Irish accent,  and he has a natural, charismatic persona that comes across so well on  film.  Kidman, too, fares well with her portrayal of Shannon; her accent is  good, and the camera likes her.  And, of course, there's a real chemistry  between them.  Howard has crafted a visually handsome movie, with a good  story told in a predominately straight forward manner.  There's not a lot  of surprises, and much of it is predictable, beyond mere foreshadowing, but  the pace is brisk and the characters are alive, which keeps it all  interesting.  Also, there's a touch of humor thrown in at appropriate  junctures, which helps to offset the dramatics, maintain a positive  atmosphere, and keep it all from becoming too sullen.  The cinematography  is especially notable, particularly early on, when capturing some of the  lush vistas of Ireland, and later during the ""land rush"" sequence.  The  performances are good all around, and the excellent supporting cast  includes Thomas Gibson (Steven), Barbara Babcock (Nora Christie), Cyril  Cusack (Danty Duff) and Michelle Johnson (Grace).  ""Far and Away"" is well  made and delivered, and, most importantly, it's an entertaining movie;  perhaps not one of the most memorable Howard has made, but it's an  enjoyable film, and well worth seeing.  All in all, it makes for a pleasant  night at the movies.",3,"She's A &quot;Corker,&quot; This One",962668800,"07 4, 2000",2000,3588,"['1892', 'Ireland', 'son', 'poor', 'farmer', 'forms', 'unlikely', 'alliance', 'daughter', 'wealthy', 'landowner', 'Far', 'Away', 'romantic', 'adventure', 'directed', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'starring', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'When', 'father', 'dies', 'agent', 'landlord', 'whom', 'back', 'rent', 'owed', 'burns', 'modest', 'home', 'ground', 'Joseph', 'Donnelly', 'Cruise', 'revenge', 'Armed', 'ancient', 'rusty', 'rifle', 'estate', 'landowner', 'Daniel', 'Christie', 'Robert', 'Prosky', 'intending', 'shoot', 'plans', 'settle', 'score', 'quickly', 'go', 'awry', 'bead', 'Christie', 'trigger', 'rifle', 'face', 'Christie', 'home', 'treat', 'wounds', 'there', 'Joseph', 'eye', 'Christie', 'daughter', 'Shannon', 'Kidman', 'lad', 'pluck', 'obviously', 'scrapper', 'immediately', 'means', 'can', 'effect', 'dream', 'running', 'away', 'America', 'where', 'are', 'giving', 'land', 'away', 'free', 'so', 'ad', 'ripped', 'newspaper', 'undertaking', 'would', 'be', 'impossible', 'woman', 'traveling', 'alone', 'man', 'such', 'Joseph', 'tend', 'needs', 'offer', 'protection', 'could', 'be', 'done', 'Circumstances', 'prevail', 'favor', 'soon', 'two', 'are', 'off', 'covertly', 'plan', 'being', 'land', 'Boston', 'then', 'head', 'west', 'Oklahoma', 'Territory', 'where', 'Shannon', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'claim', 'land', 'course', 'Joseph', 'land', 'as', 'well', 'hit', 'snag', 'however', 'landing', 'Boston', 'Shannon', 'silver', 'spoons', 'stolen', 'mother', 'trek', 'west', 'was', 'be', 'financed', 'are', 'stolen', 'leaving', 'means', 'help', 'manage', 'find', 'affordable', 'accommodations', 'room', 'local', 'bordello', 'Shannon', 'work', 'factory', 'Meanwhile', 'Joseph', 'can', 'make', 'money', 'prizefighting', 'one', 'local', 'pubs', 'sponsorship', 'man', 'named', 'Kelly', 'Colm', 'Meaney', 'connected', 'Irishman', 'town', 'enough', 'keep', 'going', 'temporarily', 'question', 'can', 'make', 'Oklahoma', 'time', 'land', 'rush', '1893', 'Cruise', 'credible', 'performance', 'here', 'Joseph', 'complete', 'passable', 'Irish', 'accent', 'natural', 'charismatic', 'persona', 'so', 'well', 'film', 'Kidman', 'too', 'fares', 'well', 'portrayal', 'Shannon', 'accent', 'good', 'camera', 'course', 'real', 'chemistry', 'Howard', 'crafted', 'visually', 'handsome', 'movie', 'good', 'story', 'told', 'predominately', 'straight', 'forward', 'manner', 'not', 'lot', 'surprises', 'much', 'predictable', 'mere', 'foreshadowing', 'pace', 'brisk', 'characters', 'are', 'alive', 'interesting', 'Also', 'touch', 'humor', 'thrown', 'appropriate', 'junctures', 'offset', 'dramatics', 'maintain', 'positive', 'atmosphere', 'keep', 'becoming', 'too', 'sullen', 'cinematography', 'especially', 'notable', 'particularly', 'early', 'when', 'capturing', 'lush', 'vistas', 'Ireland', 'later', 'land', 'rush', 'sequence', 'performances', 'are', 'good', 'excellent', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Thomas', 'Gibson', 'Steven', 'Barbara', 'Babcock', 'Nora', 'Christie', 'Cyril', 'Cusack', 'Danty', 'Duff', 'Michelle', 'Johnson', 'Grace', 'Far', 'Away', 'well', 'made', 'delivered', 'most', 'importantly', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'not', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'Howard', 'made', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing', 'pleasant', 'night', 'movies']",N/A

Ron Howard, who inhabits a light-hearted universe and does so very well, tried to make a kind of serious comedy.  Big mistake.  Cruise, who I think is under-rated as an actor, is somehow off-key in this, like he is barely trying to get it right.  Even the beautiful and charismatic Kidman is flat in this, in a ridiculous part of an aristocrat wanting to become an American.  Not only is the story outlandishly unrealistic and stupidly romantic, but the theme of ""great leveling"" on coming to the promised land is heavy handed and lacks subtlety.Not recommended.

Joseph Donnelly (Cruise) is the headstrong brother of a family of tenant farmers, who finds himself on the boat to America after he originally went to his landlord's mannor to avenge his father's death.Donnelly does not initially realize that Mr. Christie is actually a likeable (if absent minded) fellow, and it is his family associates who are responsible for the murder and the home burning. These Protestants look down upon the Catholic Donnellys (among many other families) as being beneath them.While there, he meets their daughter Shannon, a firebrand self-described modern woman who would do ANYTHING to avoid ending up like her mother's stuffy Victorian friends. From ridding fast to wearing free clothes, Shannon wants much more out of life than what she originally had. When she teams up with Joseph, she gets it.After her spoons are convieniently stolen upon arrival in America, Shannon comes to the painful realization that she does not know what to do. She is now in the position of having to learn survival skills from Joseph (who poses as her brother) if she is going to make it out to Oklahoma.Sure, improbabilities abound in this film (Cruise hangs out with brothel girls in an age before the ready availability of condoms, but never gets venereal disease, Shannon and her family are magically reunited in Boston even after she wanted nothing to do with them and did not appear to know their new address, and Mr. Christie himself has no problems pulling his own weight in America while the rest of his family had not known how to do these things).An excellent camera panning, a generally good script, and the hit 'book of days' by Enya easily compensate for any flaws. You become so involved in this film that the screenplay length ultimately does not matter.

Haven't a clue why because it certainly is better than other rubbish such as MI-2,and Cocktail which did well at the box officeThis is one of my favorite movies of all time and remains among my top 10 films of all time.  I am also happy to find that it is one of Tom's favorite movies. He has nothing to be ashamed of he's right this is one of the best and most satisfying films he's done. This is also the movie which caused me to fall in love with Tom and made me a life time fan of his-in that no matter what he does-I still like him.  No other male actor in current Hollywood history enjoys this status.Anyway Far and Away chronicles  the story of a poor young man Joseph and rich young woman Shannon who escape Ireland for different reasons- actually it is the same reason to embark on a new life- in America- where they think that they will have a better life.  Things do not go quite as they expected and the movie traces their ups and downs to the enevitable happy conclusion.This film is also a love story, but is not treacly and sappy like &quot;The Titanic&quot; (whose love story is ludicrous in itself). Joseph and Shannon can't stand each other on the surface-- but as the movie progresses you can see the bond and affection that they have for each other.  In fact the they two (relatively chase) kisses they exchange in the entire film was of a lot more believable, tender and sexy than any sex romp I've been forced to sit through over and overThis is a wonderful movie with a nice old fashioned story.  I don't know what improvement has been made to the DVD, but occassionally this film is shown in it complete full length on TV.

Instead of killing Christie, however, he is injured and sentenced to a duel with Christie's arrogant manager, Stephen Chase. Meanwhile, Shannon, Daniel's daughter, is growing dissatisfied with the traditional views of her parents' generation and longs to be modern. She makes her plans to leave for America, and with her help, Joseph is able to escape. Upon arriving in Boston, Mass., they find jobs and begin saving money. Joseph becomes a local barehands boxer, while Shannon works in a chicken processing plant and then as a dancer at the social club. All goes well until Joseph loses a boxing match, after which their money is taken away. Joseph and Shannon are left to starve in the winter cold. Shannon's parents, still in Ireland, face a devastating loss and decide to come to America to be with her. Chase, who joined them, has begun a campaign to find her, but his efforts are unnecessary Joseph brings Shannon to them after an accident. Joseph then heads west to work on the railroad. After many months, Joseph is confronted by his father in a dream, and is reminded of his desire to own his own land.

However, there is one thing that the movie doesn't have: a very good story. The film seems to wander all over the genre map skipping from grand historical epic to tear-jerking romance to updated Western. That confusion makes the film a little shaky. However, the film really isn't any of the above-mentioned genres. No, FAR AND AWAY is basically a romantic comedy set against the backdrop of a nineteenth century immigration tale. When watched in this vein, the film seems much more whole. Besides, the main reason people originally watched this film wasn't for the story; it was to see Cruise and Kidman in their skivvies.",4,Before TITANIC,1038355200,"11 27, 2002",2002,807,"['great', 'deal', 'FAR', 'AWAY', 'spectacular', 'got', 'great', 'cast', 'breathtaking', 'scenery', 'moving', 'sentimental', 'score', 'wonderful', 'direction', 'brilliant', 'cinematography', 'However', 'one', 'thing', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'very', 'good', 'story', 'film', 'wander', 'genre', 'map', 'skipping', 'grand', 'historical', 'epic', 'tear-jerking', 'romance', 'updated', 'Western', 'confusion', 'film', 'little', 'shaky', 'However', 'film', 'really', ""n't"", 'above-mentioned', 'genres', 'No', 'FAR', 'AND', 'AWAY', 'basically', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'set', 'backdrop', 'nineteenth', 'century', 'immigration', 'tale', 'When', 'watched', 'vein', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'whole', 'main', 'reason', 'people', 'originally', 'watched', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'story', 'was', 'see', 'Cruise', 'Kidman', 'skivvies']",N/A

People have slammed this film for one reason or another, and I know its a matter of opinion, but honestly, Far and Away is a good film. It is not great and not perfect. But it is enjoyable and a good love story, though that really is the back story to the film. Its more than a love story, its about 2 people doing everything they possibly can in a new and strange land. A former rich girl resorts to plucking chickens just to make a few extra coins. And a poor man who has a great talent, knocking people out. Its a somewhat long film, but I didn't get bored watching it at any time. Its subtle and engaging. Tom and Nicole both did a great job as pretend Irish. I thought Nicole especially really looked the part. It was very believable, from the both of them. Great scenery is also a plus in this. Its a great dramatic love story and really portrays that time period very well, I thought.",4,Still a favorite,1203465600,"02 20, 2008",2008,981,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'countless', 'times', 'just', 'one', 'films', 'never', 'tire', 'People', 'have', 'slammed', 'film', 'one', 'reason', 'know', 'matter', 'opinion', 'honestly', 'Far', 'Away', 'good', 'film', 'not', 'great', 'not', 'perfect', 'enjoyable', 'good', 'love', 'story', 'really', 'back', 'story', 'film', 'more', 'love', 'story', '2', 'people', 'doing', 'everything', 'possibly', 'can', 'new', 'strange', 'land', 'former', 'rich', 'girl', 'resorts', 'plucking', 'chickens', 'just', 'make', 'few', 'extra', 'coins', 'poor', 'man', 'who', 'great', 'talent', 'knocking', 'people', 'out', 'somewhat', 'long', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'bored', 'watching', 'time', 'subtle', 'engaging', 'Tom', 'Nicole', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'pretend', 'Irish', 'thought', 'Nicole', 'especially', 'really', 'looked', 'part', 'was', 'very', 'believable', 'Great', 'scenery', 'also', 'plus', 'great', 'dramatic', 'love', 'story', 'really', 'portrays', 'time', 'period', 'very', 'well', 'thought']",N/A

44615,AP3B615GM191G,0783201672,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 0]","Usually, the films that stick with us are the ones that do a number of things right (as opposed to just focusing on one area).  ""Far & Away"" manages to do EXACTLY that by showcasing not only a compelling story, but also supplementing it with top-notch acting, high drama, and a soundtrack that is a perfect fit.For a basic plot summary, this movie tells the story of Joseph Donnelly (Tom Cruise) & Shannon Christie (Nicole Kidman), who leave Ireland of the late 1800s with each other (though not necessarily ""together"") in order to find freedom.  Once in the States, however, they discover that life may not be as easy as buying a horse and staking a land claim.  The ultimate prize: a chance for a land-grab into the newly demarcated Oklahoma Territories.First off, ""Far and Away"" is a great movie because it allows you to truly care about the two lead characters.  The beginning of the film spends the right amount of time developing them so that when they land in America together, one can't help but root for them all the way through.  Only helping matter is that such fine actors as Cruise/Kidman are playing the roles, as their chemistry with each other is spot-on.Just as importantly, however, is the sense of ""fun"" that this experience conveys.  Though a very serious movie at times, ""Far & Away"" also has more than its share of light-hearted moments and adventurous romps.  As such, every scene is a joy to watch and the proceedings never get boring.  The incredible score from John Williams, of course, illustrates the mood of every scene.Overall, this is a great picture that contains something for all to enjoy, whether you prefer strong characters, hijinks, music, drama, adventure, emotion, or any combination of the above!  It is one of my favorites to watch just for the sheer fun of the experience.",5,Drama/Adventure At Its Very Finest,1355702400,"12 17, 2012",2012,1815,"['Usually', 'films', 'stick', 'are', 'ones', 'do', 'number', 'things', 'right', 'opposed', 'just', 'focusing', 'one', 'area', 'Far', 'Away', 'do', 'EXACTLY', 'showcasing', 'not', 'only', 'compelling', 'story', 'also', 'supplementing', 'top-notch', 'acting', 'high', 'drama', 'soundtrack', 'perfect', 'fit.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'movie', 'story', 'Joseph', 'Donnelly', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Shannon', 'Christie', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'who', 'leave', 'Ireland', 'late', '1800s', 'other', 'not', 'necessarily', 'together', 'order', 'find', 'freedom', 'Once', 'States', 'however', 'discover', 'life', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'easy', 'buying', 'horse', 'staking', 'land', 'claim', 'ultimate', 'prize', 'chance', 'land-grab', 'newly', 'demarcated', 'Oklahoma', 'Territories.First', 'off', 'Far', 'Away', 'great', 'movie', 'truly', 'care', 'two', 'lead', 'characters', 'beginning', 'film', 'right', 'amount', 'time', 'developing', 'so', 'when', 'land', 'America', 'together', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'root', 'way', 'Only', 'helping', 'matter', 'such', 'fine', 'actors', 'Cruise/Kidman', 'are', 'playing', 'roles', 'chemistry', 'other', 'spot-on.Just', 'importantly', 'however', 'sense', 'fun', 'experience', 'conveys', 'very', 'serious', 'movie', 'times', 'Far', 'Away', 'also', 'more', 'share', 'light-hearted', 'moments', 'adventurous', 'romps', 'such', 'scene', 'joy', 'watch', 'proceedings', 'never', 'get', 'boring', 'incredible', 'score', 'John', 'Williams', 'course', 'mood', 'scene.Overall', 'great', 'picture', 'something', 'enjoy', 'prefer', 'strong', 'characters', 'hijinks', 'music', 'drama', 'adventure', 'emotion', 'combination', 'above', 'one', 'favorites', 'watch', 'just', 'sheer', 'fun', 'experience']",N/A
