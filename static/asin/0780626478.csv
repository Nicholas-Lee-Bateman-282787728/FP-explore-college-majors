While &quot;Blast From the Past&quot; is definitely in that category of stories, the focus is almost reversed. We never really have any doubts as to whether our hero will cope with a strange new world, the question is, how will the world cope with him.Brendan Fraser is perfectly cast as a young man seeing the world for the first time, after getting the ultimate sheltered upbringing; fall-out shelter that is. During the Cuban missile crisis his parents, Calvin and Helen Webber, retreat to their backyard shelter. This turns out to be a good idea as it saves them from a plane that crashes into their perfect 50's home, but the explosion only serves to convince them that the atomic war has commenced. Thus begins their 35-year exile under 20 feet of rich, suburban soil.While not critical to the plot, we are treated to the birth and upbringing of young Adam Webber, as her learns science, languages and boxing from his genius father, Christopher Walken. His somewhat stressed and tipsy mother, Sissy Spacek, teaches him the fine art of dance and imbues him with impeccable 50's manners. It is like a sociology experiment. How will a man develop if he is exposed to the minimum range of consistent stimulus possible? This is especially true given that his unworldly parents actually try to shield him from the few harsh truths they do know, such as a nasty four letter word, &quot;from the archaic French, meaning roughly good&quot;.The clock ticks over and eventually Adam must face the new world. Armed with good intentions, good manners and a great shopping list, he ventures into the unknown... and immediately gets lost. But don't despair, he is half-heartedly rescued by a beautiful if cynical blond by the name of Eve, Alicia Silverstone. Once again, this is perfect casting. Adam and Eve develop a touching chemistry that forces us to buy into the whole kismet thing.Eve and her quietly gay but witty companion Troy, guide Adam through the dangers of downtown Los Angeles, while he goes shopping for supplies and a wife. But while Adam learns quickly from his new tutors, they learn even more from him. They learn to feel again, to be honest and polite. They start to see the world as if through Adams eyes and are the better for it. The message here may seem to be one of rosy nostalgia for the good old days but I prefer to think of it as a comparison between cynicism and sincerity.

While the jokes or gags were not 100 a minute, the dialogue was hilarious with some hidden  tongue in cheek jokes. Spacek as the Beaver Cleaver doting mother was  awesome. I only thought Spacek did strictly dramas and no comedy ( the  thigh machine and martini scene was great) !Christopher Walken as the  overly eccentric scientific dad was a smash; he's the only current actor  who can play such a character flawlessly. As for Brendan Fraser he's a  great actor who can switch from comedy to drama and vice versa with ease (  or combine the two). His facial expressions are a crack up ( especially  when he bugs his eyes or twitches his mouth). I am still waiting for the  day when somebody in Hollywood or anywhere else comes up with an excellent  film script for a comedy that would have Fraser playing opposite comedian  Rodney Dangerfield in a father and son piece. Or, a story that would focus  on a main central character where Fraser is the young man and Dangerfield  would play the same character aged.

An eccentric Sacramento Valley man (played to perfection by Christopher Walken) builds an enormous underground fallout shelter and the expected event  happens:  Thinking a nuclear war has started he locks in his wife, Sissy Spacek, who would have stolen the show if not for the dazzling performance by Brendan Fraser who stars as the son raised for 35 years underground.Upon surfacing he goes forward with baseball cards (originals of the greats) and stock certificates and through a series of hilarious events slowly convinces the girl of his dreams (Alicia Silverstone) that he is who he says and in the end, they all live happily ever after.It is hard to select favorite scenes but the double entendres and new jargon (for our hero) are favorites as well as his introduction to new technology.

His facial expressions are a riot, and really make the film complete.Blast From the Past is just pure humorous entertainment.  Not only is the stroyline funny, but the reading-between-the-lines and subtle dry humor is fantastic.  The whole plot just flows so well, making for a very enjoyable viewing experience.  On top of it all, the film has a pleasant underlying message, stressing good family values.Fraser is terrific in his role as the naiive Adam Webber.  Despite his tremendous acting ability, Fraser's facial expressions easily steal the show.  He, hands down, makes this role happen.  Alicia Silverstone is the perfect compliment to him in this movie, and it is refreshing to watch her character develop over the course of the story.  Dave Foley has always been great in comedic roles, and the part of the gay room-mate seems to have been made for him in the film.  Sissy Spacek and Christopher Walken as Adam's parents are amazingly funny in their seemingly unusual roles.  On the whole, the acting in the movie was nothing less than spectacular.Blast From the Past is a wonderful film to gather the family around.

The theme is a bit far fetched and contrived, but it has a few little twists and turns that might put a smile on your face. Brendan Fraser is the son (born and reared in a bomb shelter) of Walken and Spacek, and when there is an explosion outside their house, they think it is a nuclear accident and go to live in their underground bomb shelter. After 30 odd years, they run low on supplies and decide they need to venture out of the bomb shelter. Fraser is enlisted to do this even though he has never been in the outside world. His misadventures are somewhat funny, but it grows tiresome rather quickly. His interactions with Alicia Silverstone are also rather contrived and unbelievable. I like what I know of Silverstone and how she lives her real life (veganism, protecting animals) much more than I like her film roles.

Darling ""naive cynic""","[1, 2]","This is an enjoyable film in a brain bubblegum kind of way; Brendan Fraser is charming, Alicia Silverstone is adorable, and the rest of the cast perform well, too.Christopher Walken is a brilliant scientist who has created a huge, completely self-sustaining, unbelievably well-stocked nuclear bomb shelter beneath his family's home. During the Cuban missile crisis, he mistakenly believes that a nuclear bomb has been dropped, and locks his pregnant wife into this 35-year-time-locked bomb shelter. Brendan Fraser's character, Adam, is born there, and spends the first 34 years of his life underground, with only his parents for company. Predictably, after the 35 years are up, Adam emerges a bit odd, very polite, and exceedingly naive (but very well-schooled, thanks to his scientist father.) Adam learns about the modern world with help from Alicia Silverstone and David Foley, and searches for a wife (I'll give you three guesses as to whom he falls for, but who isn't interested in return.) Adam is not only lonely for female companionship, but he's lost as well; he can't remember how to get back to the the family's bomb shelter, which understandably causes him great distress. It's basically a happy movie, though, and appropriate for the family.Even though the story isn't compelling or particularly well-written, it's charming and entertaining, anyhow.

Brilliant but eccentric inventor Calvin Webber (Christopher Walken) believes an atomic holocaust has occur and hides with his wife in a self-sustaining fallout shelter beneath his suburban home. There they stay and rise their son until he is 35 years old. Sounds pretty weird and it is, yet there is something about this whole segment that captivates me, how the shelter becomes their whole world, they put a green carpet outside the main bldg to represent grass and the mom even goes with a shopping cart to do the groceries in the storage room. The dad teaching his kid history about a world he has never seen, there is some charm to it. And I gotta say all this is played tongue in cheek so is not a claustrophobic scenario but is more like a 50s TV sitcom played inside a nuclear shelter. Anyways once is determined to be safe to go up again, innocent but loyal Adam (Brendan Fraser) is sent to explore and get supplies and this is where he meets the cynical Eve (Alicia Silverstone). I think the success of this film relays on actors they given a script that is not always coherent yet they make it work. Walken and Spacek are amazing as the slightly loony parents and more than once I feel their detachment with reality a bit sad. Also Fraser & Silverstone's pairing are perfect for their roles.

Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[12, 12]","Brendan Fraser and Alicia Silverstone head up a wonderful cast in this lighthearted romantic comedy about a man named Adam Weber's (Fraser) first steps into society after being in a fallout shelter for his entire life.  Fraser's parents are played by the flawless Christopher Walken and the wonderful Sissy Spacek.  Walken is a scientist who mistakes a plane crash in his backyard for a Cuban nuclear missile strike.  He takes his family into a fallout shelter and waits until the time is right to surface.  After thirty-five years, things have changed a tad and he arises to find Joey Slotnick managing a rundown bar/soda fountain.  Thinking that Walken is God, or something similar at least, Slotnick becomes Archbishop Melker in one of the funniest characters I've seen in awhile.  After suffering severe shock, it is decided that Adam should be the one to go to the surface in search of supplies.  He's told to avoid the adult magazine store (invisible, poisonous gas) and to bring back a suitable girlfriend for obvious reasons.Fraser surfaces and begins his quest for food and a woman.  Along the way, he experiences the wonders of color television and sees a black postal worker that illicits one of the funniest lines in the flick.  He runs into Alicia Silverstone, properly named Eve, and befriends her when he realizes he needs a co-pilot in this strange land.  He is then introduced to her friend, Dave Foley, who turns in another wonderful performance.  The story rolls along with Silverstone trying to determine whether or not Adam is off his rocker and falls in love with him along the way.  That's about all I can say without spoiling anything.The fish-out-of-water concept turns in quite a few hilarious scenarios in this film.  Fraser was perfectly cast due to the fact that he can become so innocent and gosh-darn nice that his character is very believable.Pick this one up for a great romantic comedy.

It is a funny and  endearing romantic comedy that is peppered with a terrific cast and excellent performances. I would gladly watch it again.Calvin Webber (Christopher Walken), a nerdy, nutty scientist, and his traditional and very pregnant wife, Helen (Sissy Spacek),  are living in California in fifties style splendor in the early nineteen sixties, when the Cuban Missile Crisis occurs. Buying into the red scare of the day and convinced that attack by the communists is imminent, they  immediately go underground into the super deluxe bomb shelter that Calvin had had the foresight to build under his house and fully equip with enough supplies to last thirty five years. No sooner do they do so, Calvin's fears are reinforced, as suddenly a force of great impact shudders overhead. Thinking that they were hit by an atomic blast set off by the communists, they hunker down for the next thirty five years, waiting for the radiation to dissipate.In the interim, they have a baby boy, whom they name Adam (Brendan Fraser). As Adam grows up, he is unknowingly caught in a time warp with his parents, as they have no contact with the outside world.  Adam's world view and values reflect that of his parents, as his entire life, thus far, has been spent underground soley in their company. When the thirty five years are up, Calvin surfaces briefly to check the state of affairs topside. What he sees, he misinterprets, and upon his return to the bomb shelter ends up having a heart attack. He and Helen then dispatch Adam on a reconnaissance mission to get needed supplies.What transpires when Adam ventures into the outside world is very funny and often poignant. As played by Brendan Fraser, the thirty five year old Adam, a fresh faced, polite virgin with no fashion sense, has a Dudley-Do-Right quality and a load of goofy, sincere charm that ensures the comedic success of  this film. His foray into the outside world, his endearingly innocent interpretation of all that he sees, and his interaction with others will leave the viewer laughing. When he runs into Eve (Alicia Silverstone), the hard edged, appropriately named, beautiful blonde with a heart of gold, he is smitten. Together they will leave the viewer hoping that Adam and Eve will find the Garden of Eden.Christopher Walker is wonderful as the slightly nutty, paranoid but brilliant scientist. Sissy Spacek shows a distinct comedic flair as the patient and long suffering wife who buys into her husband's vision of things. Dave Foley of ""Kids in the Hall"" fame is terrific as Eve's drolly funny, gay roommate. Alicia Silverstone, while ostensibly the weakest link in this otherwise brilliantly cast comedy, still manages to give a more than acceptable performance as the cynical Eve. It is Brendan Fraser, however, with his aw-shucks, innocent veneer, who deftly steals the show right under everyone's nose. His charming and funny, ingratiating performance is one that will have the viewer watching this film over and over again. This is a must have comedy for one's personal collection.",5,A VERY FUNNY FILM...,1047513600,"03 13, 2003",2003,3114,"['have', 'seen', 'movie', 'twice', 'have', 'loved', 'times', 'funny', 'endearing', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'peppered', 'terrific', 'cast', 'excellent', 'performances', 'would', 'gladly', 'watch', 'again.Calvin', 'Webber', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'nerdy', 'nutty', 'scientist', 'traditional', 'very', 'pregnant', 'wife', 'Helen', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'are', 'living', 'California', 'fifties', 'style', 'splendor', 'early', 'nineteen', 'sixties', 'when', 'Cuban', 'Missile', 'Crisis', 'occurs', 'Buying', 'red', 'scare', 'day', 'convinced', 'attack', 'communists', 'imminent', 'immediately', 'go', 'underground', 'super', 'deluxe', 'bomb', 'shelter', 'Calvin', 'had', 'had', 'foresight', 'build', 'house', 'fully', 'equip', 'enough', 'supplies', 'last', 'thirty', 'five', 'years', 'sooner', 'do', 'do', 'so', 'Calvin', 'fears', 'are', 'reinforced', 'suddenly', 'force', 'great', 'impact', 'shudders', 'overhead', 'Thinking', 'were', 'hit', 'atomic', 'blast', 'set', 'off', 'communists', 'hunker', 'down', 'next', 'thirty', 'five', 'years', 'waiting', 'radiation', 'dissipate.In', 'interim', 'have', 'baby', 'boy', 'whom', 'name', 'Adam', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'Adam', 'up', 'unknowingly', 'caught', 'time', 'warp', 'parents', 'have', 'contact', 'outside', 'world', 'Adam', 'world', 'view', 'values', 'reflect', 'parents', 'entire', 'life', 'thus', 'far', 'been', 'spent', 'underground', 'soley', 'company', 'When', 'thirty', 'five', 'years', 'are', 'up', 'Calvin', 'briefly', 'check', 'state', 'affairs', 'topside', 'What', 'return', 'bomb', 'shelter', 'up', 'having', 'heart', 'attack', 'Helen', 'then', 'dispatch', 'Adam', 'reconnaissance', 'mission', 'get', 'needed', 'supplies.What', 'when', 'Adam', 'ventures', 'outside', 'world', 'very', 'funny', 'often', 'poignant', 'played', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'thirty', 'five', 'year', 'old', 'Adam', 'fresh', 'faced', 'polite', 'virgin', 'fashion', 'sense', 'Dudley-Do-Right', 'quality', 'load', 'goofy', 'sincere', 'charm', 'comedic', 'success', 'film', 'foray', 'outside', 'world', 'endearingly', 'innocent', 'interpretation', 'interaction', 'others', 'will', 'leave', 'viewer', 'laughing', 'When', 'Eve', 'Alicia', 'Silverstone', 'hard', 'edged', 'appropriately', 'named', 'beautiful', 'blonde', 'heart', 'gold', 'smitten', 'Together', 'will', 'leave', 'viewer', 'hoping', 'Adam', 'Eve', 'will', 'find', 'Garden', 'Eden.Christopher', 'Walker', 'wonderful', 'slightly', 'nutty', 'paranoid', 'brilliant', 'scientist', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'distinct', 'comedic', 'flair', 'patient', 'long', 'suffering', 'wife', 'who', 'husband', 'vision', 'things', 'Dave', 'Foley', 'Kids', 'Hall', 'fame', 'terrific', 'Eve', 'drolly', 'funny', 'gay', 'roommate', 'Alicia', 'Silverstone', 'ostensibly', 'weakest', 'link', 'otherwise', 'brilliantly', 'cast', 'comedy', 'still', 'give', 'more', 'acceptable', 'performance', 'cynical', 'Eve', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'however', 'aw-shucks', 'innocent', 'veneer', 'who', 'deftly', 'show', 'right', 'everyone', 'nose', 'charming', 'funny', 'ingratiating', 'performance', 'one', 'will', 'have', 'viewer', 'watching', 'film', 'over', 'again', 'must', 'have', 'comedy', 'one', 'personal', 'collection']",N/A

34823,AWWY3JYKYJIOS,0780626478,MagicSinglez,"[3, 3]","Director Hugh Wilson (Police Academy) seems to be making a social statement here. The romance/comedy between Adam (Brandon Frasier) and Eve (Alicia Silverston) seems an incidental add-on. So much care and attention to detail went into creating the look and feel of 1960 America, the whole point of the movie must be to contrast that time with today. I don't buy the Webber family going down into their elaborate back yard shelter in 1960 then returning to the surface in 1999, as simply a vehicle for this romance comedy.The Webbers are a nice family if not perfect. Mr Webber dresses and acts a lot like Michael Douglas in the movie 'Falling Down'. During a period of tension during the cold war, while the Webber family is in the bomb shelter - a plane crashes in the families yard - they assume nuclear war. They educate and train their only child Adam underground as best they can inside the bomb shelter. Time passes. Mr Webber sends his son Adam, 35 now, above ground for the first time to get supplies for the family. Telling him, ""be careful for mutants, son"". When Adam gets up top, he mistakes half the people he meets for mutants (transsexuals, punk rockers, etc).Adam does meet Eve, falling in love with her. First, prudently asking if she's a mutant or not. The characters in this film are all likable - the Webber family, and Eve, playing a redemptive role here, and Eve's friend Troy - as is the movie itself likable.As is the case in many movies, the child here, Adam (who's only ever met 2 people in his entire life, his mom and dad), has a lesson for the adults. Adam saying, ""Manners, are just a way for us to show other people we care about them"". Later adding, ""A 'gentleman' is someone who always tries to make sure people around him or her are as comfortable as possible"". Eve asks about Adam, ""Where do you think he got all that information""?

I can't name the good actors in this because EVERYBODY did a fantastic job, even Alicia Silverstone.The plot is pretty simple.  In 1962, at the height of the Cuban Missile crisis, a young Southern California couple heads down to their elaborately designed fallout shelter, built by the genius, yet paranoid husband (Christopher Walken).  They had only planned on staying for a few days, but at the same time, a military jet crashes into their house above.  They mistakenly think the crash is a nuclear bomb explosion, so they seal it up and stay down for 35 years.  The wife (Sissy Spacek) is 9 months pregnant at the time, so she has her baby (Brendan Fraser) in the shelter.After 35 years, the father is ready to explore the world to see if it is habitable, but just as he's about to get some much-needed supplies, he has a mild heart-attack.  They send their son out instead with a long list and $3000 in cash.  He has also expressed being lonely and says he wants to find a wife.The most entertaining and pleasant portion of the story is how a very nice, conservative upbringing with absolutely no outside negative influences can stick out like a sore thumb in modern society.  This is also sad, to think how low we've sunk.  But still, it's extremely refreshing to see a small sparkle of goodness walk around the Los Angeles area, creating positive results everywhere he goes.The only problem that I have with it is that it is not 100% believable.  Some of the scenes were overlooked in the making that kept reminding you that it wasn't real.  Even though he had never seen some of the electronics, he seemed to pick them up a little too fast: TV with remote, elevator, telephone, etc.  The first time he EVER saw the ocean (or any large body of water) in his entire life, he made a PERFECT dive into the water?!But the good far outweighs the bad in this one.  I highly recommend this to just about everyone out there.

The first five minutes are pretty dull, so I tend to skip past them, as it really starts when the plane crashes into the house.Christopher Walken & Sissy Spacek are the perfect people to play Brendan Fraser's parents, both as quirky as each other. Sissy plays the perfect wife, drinking to escape her husband and life below ground. Christopher is perfect as the Dad, teaching his son everything he knows.Alicia Silverstone is kooky, ""psychic"", and is a perfect match for Adam's character, and of course she has to be called Eve. How original.Troy's character is brilliant, playing the stereotypical gay guy, which Adam thinks means ""happy"". Troy and Eve live together, and have a very similar relationship to Will & Grace in the TV show. The girl who has a gay guy for a roommate - tell me, how many times has that been done?The first fifteen minutes go quickly through the first 35 years of Adam's (Brendan Fraser) uneventful life, cutting back and forth between what's going on above the family.I couldn't imagine anyone else in the part of innocent Adam, apart from Brendan. He comes out with the funniest expressions! He is brought up to be the perfect gentleman - opening doors for women, calling them ma'am, doing all those things, the guy who every girl would like but then quickly get fed up of!Some parts of the film aren't explained, leaving you wondering how they had enough supplies to last 35 years, how none of them got seriously ill, until the dad does twenty minutes in, forcing Adam to go up into the big bad world, and how the money hasn't changed in 35 years!The funniest bits of the film are when Adam talks to complete strangers, in his off-hand way. The best sequence in the whole film is The Mask-reminiscent dance scene, when Adam goes to a club and dances with the two women. It's very similar to when Jim Carrey & Cameron Diaz dance together in The Mask; both are great & memorable. And like any dance scenes in films (Grease, The Mask, Saturday Night Fever) the crowd instantly makes a circle around the main people dancing and watches them. This wouldn't happen in real life, so why do they keep repeating this in films?The storyline is pretty predictable: boy meets girl, boy loses girl, and boy gets girl back.There aren't many extras on the DVD. There are trailers; cast & crew biographies; deleted scenes and a B-roll. They're your basic extras - not worth watching more than once, if you can last through them. According to the back of my DVD, there's a ""Love Meter"" but I can't find it amongst the extras so god knows where it is.This is definitely for sentimental fools, like me, who love a good romance, and think Brendan Fraser is so cute - just not when he sings!",4,Adam & Eve in Modern Day,1063411200,"09 13, 2003",2003,2793,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'lot', 'times', 'more', ""'d"", 'care', 'admit', 'never', 'tire', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'are', 'pretty', 'dull', 'tend', 'skip', 'really', 'when', 'plane', 'crashes', 'house.Christopher', 'Walken', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'are', 'perfect', 'people', 'play', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'parents', 'as', 'quirky', 'other', 'Sissy', 'perfect', 'wife', 'drinking', 'escape', 'husband', 'life', 'ground', 'Christopher', 'perfect', 'Dad', 'teaching', 'son', 'everything', 'Silverstone', 'kooky', 'psychic', 'perfect', 'match', 'Adam', 'character', 'course', 'be', 'called', 'Eve', 'How', 'character', 'brilliant', 'playing', 'stereotypical', 'gay', 'guy', 'Adam', 'happy', 'Troy', 'Eve', 'live', 'together', 'have', 'very', 'similar', 'relationship', 'Will', 'Grace', 'TV', 'show', 'girl', 'who', 'gay', 'guy', 'roommate', 'tell', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'been', 'done', 'first', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'go', 'quickly', 'first', '35', 'years', 'Adam', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'uneventful', 'life', 'cutting', 'back', 'forth', 'what', 'going', 'family.I', 'could', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'anyone', 'else', 'part', 'innocent', 'Adam', 'apart', 'Brendan', 'out', 'funniest', 'expressions', 'brought', 'up', 'be', 'perfect', 'gentleman', 'opening', 'doors', 'women', 'calling', ""ma'am"", 'doing', 'things', 'guy', 'who', 'girl', 'would', 'like', 'then', 'quickly', 'get', 'fed', 'parts', 'film', 'are', ""n't"", 'explained', 'leaving', 'wondering', 'how', 'had', 'enough', 'supplies', 'last', '35', 'years', 'how', 'none', 'got', 'seriously', 'ill', 'dad', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'forcing', 'Adam', 'go', 'up', 'big', 'bad', 'world', 'how', 'money', ""n't"", 'changed', '35', 'years', 'funniest', 'bits', 'film', 'are', 'when', 'Adam', 'talks', 'complete', 'strangers', 'off-hand', 'way', 'best', 'sequence', 'whole', 'film', 'Mask-reminiscent', 'dance', 'scene', 'when', 'Adam', 'club', 'dances', 'two', 'women', 'very', 'similar', 'when', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'dance', 'together', 'Mask', 'are', 'great', 'memorable', 'dance', 'scenes', 'films', 'Grease', 'Mask', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Fever', 'crowd', 'instantly', 'circle', 'main', 'people', 'dancing', 'watches', 'would', ""n't"", 'happen', 'real', 'life', 'so', 'why', 'do', 'keep', 'repeating', 'films', 'storyline', 'pretty', 'predictable', 'boy', 'meets', 'girl', 'boy', 'girl', 'boy', 'girl', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'extras', 'DVD', 'are', 'trailers', 'cast', 'crew', 'biographies', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'B-roll', ""'re"", 'basic', 'extras', 'not', 'watching', 'more', 'once', 'can', 'last', 'According', 'back', 'DVD', 'Love', 'Meter', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'amongst', 'extras', 'so', 'god', 'where', 'definitely', 'sentimental', 'fools', 'who', 'love', 'good', 'romance', 'think', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'so', 'cute', 'just', 'not', 'when']",N/A

Fraser plays Adam Webber, the son of a Cold-War-obsessed scientist (Christopher Walken) and his wife  (Sissy Spacek) who hunker down in a fallout shelter for 35 years, when they  believe the big one has destroyed the earth.In truth, a plane fell on  their house, and their now-grown son only wishes to go and see the world.  Their neighborhood has changed a lot, from quiet suburbia to punk clubs and  adult bookstores, but Adam, who only wishes to meet a nice girl, manages to  meet his match in the appropriately named Eve, nicely played by Alicia  Silverstone with the right mix of incredulousness and sweetness. Dave Foley  (The Kids in the Hall, NewsRadio) as Eve's gay roommate and Joey Slotnick  as a stoned club owner who becomes a cult leader (you'll have to see why)  are also very funny.Director/writer Hugh Wilson has created a sweet,  satirical film that features romance with light, satirical humor.

Both films came with certain giggles and chuckles, but I wasn't overly excited about either.  Here, I very much enjoyed Mr. Fraser's performance and the film itself.  You can never go wrong with casting Christopher Walken as an excentric character in a comedy, and that is just the beginning of this flick's good points.  I'm happy to say that Alicia Silverstone has redeamed herself in my eyes after Batman and Robin (I'm not sure which came first, but I saw Batman and Robin first) and her straight-woman persona matched up nicely Brendan Fraser's goofy, out-of-time behavior.  While Dave Foley didn't quite hit all the stereotypes, you could definetly tell that his character was gay.  Like Mr. Walken, he was a great source of comic relief.

I remember going to the Country Cousins Super Market in Thousand Oaks and there was no food on the shelf's people were in a state of panic filling up two-three shopping carts of food, water, toilet paper it was like complete chaos.But the film just smacked of magic and that is because it was addressed directly to the ""Imagination"". Films like ""Blast from the Past,"" ""Awakenings"" or ""October Sky"" remind us of a time when life was much more simple and Slower back then, We had more time to realize that Life is a miracle, That just being alive was a miracle, Our mere existence was a miracle, We were dreamers back then, dreaming of a better world a better tomorrow.We don't dream anymore, we just reflect on the past, There is no more patriotism because there is more America, The Corporations have outsourced Jobs to China, Malaysia, Mexico, Japan, Cambodia and that is why there are so many unemployed people here in this country, It's not about being a Republican or a Democrat anymore,  it's about have & Have nots.Blast from the Past reminds us of a time when we pretty much had to live in fear of the Bomb. It also reminds me of Rod Serling's Twilight zone ""The Shelter"", There were family's that built bomb shelters for only two-three people enough for their own immediate family. In times of crisis people pain and become mobs, Bomb shelters were secret things.Some of the values of the fifties-Sixties were absurd like your hair couldn't touch your ear in school or wear a T-shirt without a pocket, So you could see why the Counter Culture Generation of the Sixties were necessary.A fun film that flashes back to a time when America was Patriotic.

It's about a young man, Adam Webber (Brendan Fraser - GEORGE OF THE JUNLE, THE MUMMY, THE MUMMY RETURNS), who was born and raised in a bomb shelter which his scientist father (Christopher Walken) had built secretly in case the Communists decided to drop a bomb down in their home. Adam had never been outside in the &quot;real world&quot; before and never knew anybody except his parents. All he ever wanted was a girl to love and marry.Finally, about 53 years later, their bomb shelter home is running out of supplies, and when the father has a heart attack, Adam's mother (Sissy Spacek), sends Adam out into the world to buy more supplies. When Adam gets out of the bomb shelter, he notices that everything around him is strange and totally unfamiliar. Then he meets Eve (Alicia Silverstone - CLUELESS), who shows him everything about the world above and even true love.This film is so hilarious - I was laughing all the way 'til the end. BLAST FROM THE PAST is a great teen comedy and I recommend it to anybody who loves a good laugh. It's charming, cleaver, and original. The acting is solid, too.

Brendan Fraser is charming as a young man who has spent almost his entire youth underground because his overly cautious father was a little too anxious to try out his self-built bomb shelter. Adam Webber (Fraser) learned almost everything he knows from his parents, played with goofy provinciality by Christopher Walken and Sissy Spacek. When it comes time for Adam to purchase supplies in order to restock the shelter and/or get married (dancing with mom just wasn't cutting it any more), he heads up to modern-day Los Angeles. As luck would have it, the first girl he meets, Eve, happens to fit all his qualifications for a mate, and she happens to be looking for an earnest doofus, which Adam fits to a T. So, Adam and Eve plan to populate this post-apocalyptic world with little Cains and Ables, apparently. Eve is played by the luminous, ever delectable Alicia Silverstone, and I can honestly say this is one of her better films. She has deserved so much better than she has had. This romantic comedy is unrealistic, but it is both entertaining as well as insightful. This is one of those movies that more successfully examines the concept of time displacement than science fiction films do. What happens when someone from the early 1960s is transported thirty years into the future? In retrospect, how much has changed in the past thirty years? For all our commonalities, how much has the human race changed during this period (for better or for worse)? Manners and the mentality of the Cold War are but two aspects of life this film observes.

Paranoid about the communist threat, he has made a vast and elaborate nuclear bunker under his house. And, at the height of the Cuban Missile Crisis, he takes the precaution of going into it with his pregnant wife Helen (Sissy Spacek). By bizarre coincidence, just as they get down underground, a military aircraft crashes on their house. Convinced this is the dreaded nuke, he locks in and they prepare to stay there for 35 years until the radiation reaches safe levels. Finally come the 1990s and son Adam (Brendan Fraser) is sent out to reconnoitre and get look for fresh supplies in what they are convinced is a nightmarish and disintegrated post-apocalyptic world. (The neighbour has gone badly downhill in a way that makes this a more than understandable mistake.) Out he goes armed only with an indefatigable innocence and decency, an unshakable conviction that Perry Como is at the cutting edge of popular music and what he does not yet realize is a huge fortune in vintage baseball cards. After a few hours he is seriously at sea and hopelessly lost. Then he meets Alicia Silverstone's wordly and cynical Eve...The central conceit of this film is the clash of what is basically a 1950s sensibility with the harsh and cynical realities of 1990s America. That way it strongly recalls `Pleasantville', made a year earlier. But this is a much better film. While `Pleasantville' rather condescended to the past, with its knowing modern kids teaching stuffy old 50s types how to be cool and have sex, this film is much more intelligently ambivalent about the blessings of modernity and has a very nice satirical edge. Not to mention much funnier. It is Eve who learns from Adam far more than the reverse. It's essentially an unusual romantic comedy with a bizarre fantasy premise. But it's an unusually sharp, witty and unintelligent romcom. A certain mismatch between British and American senses of humour may partly explain why I seldom laugh out loud at American movies. Several lines in this were notable exceptions. Its best moments recall, as very very few contemporary films manage to recall, the sharply observed intelligence of the great Hollywood romantic comedies of the 30s and 40s.

Here, of course, the twist is that no one has traveled in time, it just seems that way, given that Brendan Fraser's character has been locked in an elaborate bomb shelter with his parents, hilariously played by veterans Christopher Walken and Sissy Spacek.Fraser brings a spot-on gleeful tone to his character, as he discovers for the first time the joys of looking at the sun, or jumping in the ocean, or falling in love.  Casting is critical in a romantic comedy, and here the selections are superb -- in addition to Walken and Spacek, you have the very funny Dave Foley, and performing adequately in the romantic lead, Alicia Silverstone.But this is Fraser's show, and as he learns about the mores of modern-day Los Angeles, his journey is our journey, a journey of suburban America and the differences over the last 40 years between our father's generation and our own.This film is guaranteed to put you in a good mood.
