If you're a DEVO fan, you already own this.  If you're not yet a DEVO fan, you will be after seeing this.  I only wish that there were similar videos for each of their other tours.  What little I've seen from the New Traditionalists and Oh No! It's DEVO performances has left me salivating for more.  Seeing this amazing video lets me know the awesomeness that should have been preserved.  There has never been another band quite like Devo.  In concept, in sound, in style, they are totally unique.

The focus on the DVD is the music and the stage craft of the band; there are not the at times very obnoxious cutaways to audience members.The band had come a very long way from its formative days in Akron, Ohio, when concerts often degenerated into the audience throwing anything available at the musicians to try to get them off the stage.

But I loved the New Wave Era and Devo was an integral part. I purchased all of their records at the time and loved listening to them. Sure, they were quirky, but quirky in a very refreshing way. Then, in 1979, Devo came through San Diego and put on an excellent concert at the San Diego State Open Air Theater. A friend and I attended. It was one of the more bizarre concerts I've attended, that's for sure. A lot of people showed up in costumes and there were even some quintets showing up in identical costumes. Strange scene! But it was a great concert and I remember it well to this day.I just recently became aware of this Devo-Live 1980 concert DVD. Of course, I had to have it. It wasn't the same tour I attended and they weren't wearing their ""energy domes"" as yet, but the 1980 concert is a close approximation to my own experience. My wife and I watched it the other night. She thought Devo was a really strange rock act, which, of course, they were. I loved it! This DVD is very well done and I'm going to get a lot of use out of it. The video is not particularly good. The sound is not up to the quality of the records. Who cares?

My beef's with the editing.The August 17, 1980 performance of ""Gut Feeling/Slap Yer Mammy""  included on this ""LIVE 1980"" DVD can also be found on the ""DEVO: RISING SUN"" DVD as a bonus feature. The ""RISING SUN"" version shows only what a single hand-held camera photographed from the foot of the stage, but slaps yer mammy twice as hard as the ""LIVE 1980"" version.  Why?  Because the ""LIVE 1980"" edit interpolates this tune, and every other, with blurry long shots of the entire stage, shot by a locked-off camera in the balcony.  If you've ever fantasized about watching a concert entirely by security cam, this DVD brings you one step closer to your dream.As presented on ""RISING SUN"", however, ""Gut Feeling/Slap Yer Mammy"" consists of one long, unbroken piece of film.  The shot is by no means static; the cameraman creates one composition after another with attentive pans and zooms.  The unbroken shot brings the viewer up-close-and-personal with the archetypal New Wave nutjob: Mark Mothersbaugh, his ramen noodle coif tossing sweat across the lens, banishes all doubt that he's had just about all he can take, and can't take it no more.Even when, technically, he's marking time until the next lyric comes along, he stays in ferocious character.  The unblinking camera captures each twitch.  It's at these brief, dramaturgical moments that the ""1980"" editors get bored and throw in those lousy-looking long shots.The people who put this DVD together had the raw material to create something extraordinary, something exciting and organic, but because you can't make the obligatory, coked-up edit from one camera's images alone, all available filler, Grade-Z or lower, is loaded into the grinder.",4,A madness to your movements really gets my goat,1142467200,"03 16, 2006",2006,1775,"['got', 'beef', 'audio', 'beef', 'ai', ""n't"", 'picture', 'quality', 'se', 'beef', 'editing.The', 'August', '17', '1980', 'performance', 'Gut', 'Feeling/Slap', 'Yer', 'Mammy', 'included', 'LIVE', '1980', 'DVD', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'found', 'DEVO', 'RISING', 'SUN', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'feature', 'RISING', 'SUN', 'version', 'only', 'what', 'single', 'hand-held', 'camera', 'photographed', 'foot', 'stage', 'slaps', 'mammy', 'twice', 'as', 'hard', 'LIVE', '1980', 'version', 'Why', 'LIVE', '1980', 'edit', 'tune', 'other', 'blurry', 'long', 'shots', 'entire', 'stage', 'shot', 'locked-off', 'camera', 'balcony', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'fantasized', 'watching', 'concert', 'entirely', 'security', 'cam', 'DVD', 'one', 'step', 'closer', 'dream.As', 'presented', 'RISING', 'SUN', 'however', 'Gut', 'Feeling/Slap', 'Yer', 'Mammy', 'one', 'long', 'unbroken', 'piece', 'film', 'shot', 'means', 'static', 'cameraman', 'one', 'composition', 'attentive', 'pans', 'zooms', 'unbroken', 'shot', 'viewer', 'up-close-and-personal', 'archetypal', 'New', 'Wave', 'nutjob', 'Mark', 'Mothersbaugh', 'ramen', 'noodle', 'coif', 'tossing', 'sweat', 'lens', 'banishes', 'doubt', 'had', 'just', 'can', 'take', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'more.Even', 'when', 'technically', 'marking', 'time', 'next', 'lyric', 'along', 'ferocious', 'character', 'unblinking', 'camera', 'twitch', 'brief', 'dramaturgical', 'moments', '1980', 'editors', 'get', 'bored', 'throw', 'lousy-looking', 'long', 'shots.The', 'people', 'who', 'put', 'DVD', 'together', 'had', 'raw', 'material', 'create', 'something', 'extraordinary', 'something', 'exciting', 'organic', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'obligatory', 'coked-up', 'edit', 'one', 'camera', 'images', 'alone', 'available', 'filler', 'Grade-Z', 'lower', 'loaded', 'grinder']",N/A

We witness Devo proving what artful craftsmen they were onstage - this is professional showbusiness (but performed with obvious joy). Video quality is very good - and totally appropriate to the audio...neither are pristine, but you wouldn't expect or want that anyway.I like that on the DVD-Video side you're given the choice of two very different treatments of what was clearly originally a mono recording. I much prefer the soundtrack treatment by Devo's Bob Casale which is an impressive and convincing recreation of the room ambience you'd expect from that venue.

Highlights for me are the performance of ""Pink Pussycat"" and, since I am from Ohio, the inclusion of the ""What's round on the ends and HI in the middle"" riddle as part of ""Jocko Homo."" The sound quality is pretty good, considering it was recorded live in 1980. There are even a couple different audio options. Furthermore, the showmanship is most entertaining, with the guys sporting a variety of outfits, including their trademark Energy Domes. Attribute it to what you will, but the group is also very energetic throughout the performance. This is more than can be said for the Petaluma, CA audience, which does not appear to have been very large. Until the final couple songs, people in the front were more or less standing still in spite of the fact these guys were providing such an excellent show. My one complaint is that there is virtually no verbal interaction with the audience. Perhaps this was edited from the original footage for whatever reason, but Devo simply performs their songs and then leaves. I expected some witty dialogue, a monologue, anything that would allow us to get to know their personalities a little better. Nonetheless, this is a great value, with a video of a complete Devo concert from 1980 on one side and the soundtrack from the concert on the other, all for about $13.00.

Almost their entire catalog is back in print (and all the Warners albums), a series of DVD releases and even a tour! And as for the slew of concert discs to hit the market of late, ""Live 1980"" is a genuine treasure. It captures DEVO just around the time their national fame was snowballing, on the ""Freedom Of Choice"" tour. (Think red Energy Domes.)It makes the DVD a very interesting document in the fact that the band is still pretty raw. In fact, if there is any detriment to this DVD, it is that the recording quality isn't up to snuff for the sound. There are frequent splatters of distortion and the mix isn't always perfect, but this was a punky band live! So for the viewing sequences, you can overlook the sonic flaws; but it does make the CD side a ragged listen. If you really want a strong document of roughly the same concert, Rhino Handmade offers the ""Dev-O Live"" full length concert.But you wanted to WATCH, eh, spud? Then ""Live 1980"" will fill you up. Opening with ""Whip It,"" the band cascades through early material from the first three albums, including ""Pink Pussycat"" and ""Swelling Itching Brain"" from ""Duty Now For The Future."" Mark Mothersbaugh proves that he may be one of the most underrated frontmen of all time with his quirky automaton style, and the band zaps and squanks its way through with those primitive synths.Also interesting is that this was obviously not being shot for commercial release 25 years ago. The lack of intercut audience shots is very conspicuous and most welcome. You have the cameras trained the entire time on the band and not on goofball audience members with pumping fists and home-made energy helmets. It makes the concert that much more watchable.And finally, the final proof that De-evolution is very real; The opening ""Star Wars"" crawler that describes the tension of free thinkers during the age of Reagan, and then points out that things have since continued rolling backwards with ""Emperor W"" and his extremist enemies. It gets the show rolling with a sly snicker at our not so recent history.
