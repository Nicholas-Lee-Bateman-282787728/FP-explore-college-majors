581802,ASXW7UQXGMNJL,B00005EBSB,"Alan A. Elsner ""Alan Elsner, author""","[2, 2]","Tom Courtnay and a stunning Julie Christie light up this comedy set in Bradford, northern England in the early 1960s. Courtnay plays Billy, a young lad with an overheated imagination who lives much of the time in a fantasy kingdom called Ambrosia, where he is king, president, war hero and national liberator all at once. In his real life, Billy has a dreary job in a funeral home and is beset by nagging parents and sexually inhibited girlfriends. Unfortunately, Billy allows his fantasy world to encroach on reality way too much, causing all kinds of problems.This movie, well acted and pretty funny and sad at the same time, seems to anticipate Monty Python in different ways. There is even a 'funny walk' scene and another theme that runs through it is the low intensity guerrilla war between the generations.Billy wants to escape to London to become a script writer but he lacks the nerve. The Julie Christie character, Liz, is a much truer free-spirit and she's the one who ultimately has the courage and makes the break.This movie is a time capsule of Britain in the early sixties, before the Beatles liberated us from the straitjacket of conformity and before the true creation of youth culture.",4,Fine performances in this time capsule from the sixties,1336694400,"05 11, 2012",2012,1203,"['Tom', 'Courtnay', 'stunning', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'light', 'up', 'comedy', 'set', 'Bradford', 'northern', 'England', 'early', '1960s', 'Courtnay', 'Billy', 'young', 'lad', 'overheated', 'imagination', 'who', 'much', 'time', 'fantasy', 'kingdom', 'called', 'Ambrosia', 'where', 'king', 'president', 'war', 'hero', 'national', 'liberator', 'once', 'real', 'life', 'Billy', 'dreary', 'job', 'funeral', 'home', 'beset', 'nagging', 'parents', 'sexually', 'inhibited', 'girlfriends', 'Unfortunately', 'Billy', 'fantasy', 'world', 'encroach', 'reality', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'causing', 'kinds', 'problems.This', 'movie', 'well', 'acted', 'pretty', 'funny', 'sad', 'same', 'time', 'anticipate', 'Monty', 'Python', 'different', 'ways', 'even', ""'funny"", 'walk', 'scene', 'theme', 'low', 'intensity', 'guerrilla', 'war', 'generations.Billy', 'escape', 'London', 'become', 'script', 'writer', 'nerve', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'character', 'Liz', 'much', 'truer', 'free-spirit', 'one', 'who', 'ultimately', 'courage', 'break.This', 'movie', 'time', 'capsule', 'Britain', 'early', 'sixties', 'Beatles', 'liberated', 'straitjacket', 'conformity', 'true', 'creation', 'youth', 'culture']",N/A

Thanks in part to a very engaging performance by Tom Courtenay and a ravishing supporting role by a young and beautiful (and very charming) Julie Christie, `Billy Liar' is funny and just plain fun.William Fisher is a dreamer, a big dreamer.  He wants to be a famous screenwriter, but at times his aspirations tend to get ahead of him, so much so that he can't help but fudge things a little bit in order to at least make it look like he isn't all talk.  So, with that said, Billy has a bit of a problem.  He has two fianc&eacute;s who know nothing of the other, a fictitious job awaiting him in London and a dream world in his head where he is King and all know and respect him.  Billy's parents Geoffrey and Alice don't know what to do with their son.  He seems defiant and set in his ways despite all they say and do.  Rita and Barbara (his two ladies) are fed up with Billy's procrastinating and just want to be married, but Billy prefers to drift off into his head where responsibilities are non-existent and everything is as it should be.The film, like I said, can seem to be running in circles for a spell.  It doesn't have a clear target for a good portion of the running time, but merely watching Billy talk himself in and out of various predicaments, but as the film draws to a close and Billy is reunited with the spitfire Liz everything starts to fall into place and we see just where Billy is headed.Tom Courtenay is flawless as Billy, giving his character enough naivety to make his immaturity tolerable, never absurd.  Funny note; he sounds a lot like Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow.  His two loves, played by Gwendolyn Watts and Helen Fraser, are a tad annoying, but Julie Christie more than makes up for their lack of charm.  She portrays Liz with this undeniable endearing quality.  I only wish there was more of her in the film.  She has a small scene in the center of the film and then doesn't show up again until the near end, but her performance is the biggest and brightest in the film.As the film draws to a close the subject of responsibility and honesty begin to make their mark, and the entirety of `Billy Liar' makes more sense.  This is a funny and witty and in the end intelligent film.  It could have used a little more direction in the center of the film, but it works quite well in the end, and is definitely one that should not be missed.",4,I'd be lying if I said I didn't like it...,1229299200,"12 15, 2008",2008,2515,"['little', 'immature', 'go', 'where', 'while', 'end', 'Billy', 'Liar', 'proves', 'well', 'journey', 'sure', 'Thanks', 'part', 'very', 'engaging', 'performance', 'Tom', 'Courtenay', 'ravishing', 'supporting', 'role', 'young', 'beautiful', 'very', 'charming', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'Billy', 'Liar', 'funny', 'just', 'plain', 'fun.William', 'Fisher', 'dreamer', 'big', 'dreamer', 'be', 'famous', 'screenwriter', 'times', 'aspirations', 'tend', 'get', 'ahead', 'so', 'much', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'fudge', 'things', 'little', 'bit', 'order', 'least', 'make', 'look', ""n't"", 'talk', 'So', 'said', 'Billy', 'bit', 'problem', 'two', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'who', 'know', 'nothing', 'other', 'fictitious', 'job', 'awaiting', 'London', 'dream', 'world', 'head', 'where', 'King', 'know', 'respect', 'Billy', 'parents', 'Geoffrey', 'Alice', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'son', 'defiant', 'set', 'ways', 'say', 'do', 'Rita', 'Barbara', 'two', 'ladies', 'are', 'fed', 'up', 'Billy', 'procrastinating', 'just', 'want', 'be', 'married', 'Billy', 'prefers', 'drift', 'off', 'head', 'where', 'responsibilities', 'are', 'non-existent', 'everything', 'should', 'be.The', 'film', 'said', 'can', 'seem', 'be', 'running', 'circles', 'spell', ""n't"", 'have', 'clear', 'target', 'good', 'portion', 'running', 'time', 'merely', 'watching', 'Billy', 'talk', 'various', 'predicaments', 'film', 'close', 'Billy', 'reunited', 'spitfire', 'Liz', 'everything', 'fall', 'place', 'see', 'just', 'where', 'Billy', 'headed.Tom', 'Courtenay', 'flawless', 'Billy', 'giving', 'character', 'enough', 'naivety', 'make', 'immaturity', 'tolerable', 'never', 'absurd', 'Funny', 'note', 'lot', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Jack', 'Sparrow', 'two', 'loves', 'played', 'Gwendolyn', 'Watts', 'Helen', 'Fraser', 'are', 'tad', 'annoying', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'more', 'up', 'lack', 'charm', 'Liz', 'undeniable', 'endearing', 'quality', 'only', 'wish', 'was', 'more', 'film', 'small', 'scene', 'center', 'film', 'then', ""n't"", 'show', 'up', 'again', 'near', 'end', 'performance', 'biggest', 'brightest', 'film.As', 'film', 'close', 'subject', 'responsibility', 'honesty', 'begin', 'make', 'mark', 'entirety', 'Billy', 'Liar', 'more', 'sense', 'funny', 'witty', 'end', 'intelligent', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'little', 'more', 'direction', 'center', 'film', 'quite', 'well', 'end', 'definitely', 'one', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'missed']",N/A

Considering that I've had a friend like that, it gets old fast because once you know one, you've known them all. It's just the realization of how fake these people are. Of course, like a Ponzi scheme, the person lives from one lie to the next until he is exposed for what he is. When that happens, it's not a pretty picture.

Tom Courtenay is Billy, a perpetual liar; he's trapped in his own drab, stifling northern England surroundings, and his only escape is a fantasy world he's concocted. Where Mitty would just innocently imagine another time and place for himself, Billy involves everyone around him in his chronic lying. Sometimes the lies are connected with the fantasies (going to London to write TV scripts, for example), but usually they are just outright lies not connected to anything: he's engaged to two women at the same time, he lies to his boss and family about what he's up to, are just two examples. Mitty was henpecked by his wife; Billy by his whole world.Courtenay is brilliant, and the intercutting of his fantasies with the real world is also excellently done. The message is universal: we all feel trapped at times and wish we could escape; we either do escape or somehow find a rational way to cope. For Billy, there's no way to do either. He almost escapes at the end with Julie Christie, who has a small role as a creature who CAN escape at will, but he chickens out. The acting, the script, even the photography, are all superb.

581806,A1OB5L3WMHJAD9,B00005EBSB,Christopher Culver,"[0, 0]","Billy Liar is a 1963 British film that captures the monumentous changes of the era: the sexual revolution and the destruction of England's old town centres in modernisation schemes. In Bradford, Yorkshire young Billy Fisher (Tom Courtenay) is working a soul-crushing job in a funeral home and suffering daily the derision of his elderly parents. His only escape from this drudgery is his active imagination, where he imagines himself leader of his own country and misleads other townspeople about his family's situation with little fibs. His propensity to make things up and shrug off his responsibilities, however, leads him to end up dating two women at the same time (Helen Fraser and Gwendolyn Watts), though ultimately he dreams of escaping with the liberated Liz (Julie Christie).As a snapshot of Britain at a particular time, this is a valuable film. As background to Fisher's own personal struggles, the camera often shows wrecking balls smashing down the walls of old homes, and at one point a town councillor marks an entire swath of the city for demolition. A scene at a dance club captures the growing influence of rock 'n' roll on Britain. Old class tensions persisted, however, though American audiences might not entirely get this as it is often suggested only by characters' particular accents.The ending is a letdown though, essentially saying that young people should give up their silly dreams and give in to their parents' demands. This moral lesson was entirely overturned by the youth revolution that erupted through the Sixties. As the UK saw full employment through that decade, young people could take the risk of following their dreams even if it meant a rupture with their families and hometowns. Nonetheless, the comedic approach in the film makes it entertaining almost throughout, and I'd recommend that anyone see it at least once.The Criterion DVD extras are disappointing. There is an audio commentary over the film, but the only other documentary material is a featurette on how British cinema in general was changing in the 1960s. Interviews with the actors (many of whom are still very much alive) would have been nice.",3,"Interesting as a time capsule of early-1960s Britain, but weakened by its preachiness and well-worn generational conflict themes",1382054400,"10 18, 2013",2013,2155,"['Billy', 'Liar', '1963', 'British', 'film', 'monumentous', 'changes', 'era', 'sexual', 'revolution', 'destruction', 'England', 'old', 'town', 'centres', 'modernisation', 'schemes', 'Bradford', 'Yorkshire', 'young', 'Billy', 'Fisher', 'Tom', 'Courtenay', 'working', 'soul-crushing', 'job', 'funeral', 'home', 'suffering', 'daily', 'derision', 'elderly', 'parents', 'only', 'escape', 'drudgery', 'active', 'imagination', 'where', 'leader', 'own', 'country', 'other', 'townspeople', 'family', 'situation', 'little', 'fibs', 'propensity', 'make', 'things', 'up', 'shrug', 'off', 'responsibilities', 'however', 'end', 'up', 'dating', 'two', 'women', 'same', 'time', 'Helen', 'Fraser', 'Gwendolyn', 'Watts', 'though', 'ultimately', 'escaping', 'liberated', 'Liz', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'snapshot', 'Britain', 'particular', 'time', 'valuable', 'film', 'background', 'Fisher', 'own', 'personal', 'struggles', 'camera', 'often', 'wrecking', 'balls', 'smashing', 'down', 'walls', 'old', 'homes', 'one', 'point', 'town', 'councillor', 'entire', 'swath', 'city', 'demolition', 'scene', 'dance', 'club', 'growing', 'influence', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'Britain', 'Old', 'class', 'tensions', 'persisted', 'however', 'American', 'audiences', 'might', 'not', 'entirely', 'get', 'often', 'suggested', 'only', 'characters', 'particular', 'accents.The', 'ending', 'letdown', 'though', 'essentially', 'saying', 'young', 'people', 'should', 'give', 'up', 'silly', 'dreams', 'give', 'parents', 'demands', 'moral', 'lesson', 'was', 'entirely', 'overturned', 'youth', 'revolution', 'erupted', 'Sixties', 'UK', 'saw', 'full', 'employment', 'decade', 'young', 'people', 'could', 'take', 'risk', 'following', 'dreams', 'even', 'meant', 'rupture', 'families', 'hometowns', 'Nonetheless', 'comedic', 'approach', 'film', 'entertaining', 'almost', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'anyone', 'see', 'least', 'once.The', 'Criterion', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'disappointing', 'audio', 'commentary', 'film', 'only', 'other', 'documentary', 'material', 'featurette', 'how', 'British', 'cinema', 'general', 'was', 'changing', '1960s', 'Interviews', 'actors', 'many', 'whom', 'are', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'alive', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice']",N/A

A superb widescreen copy, english subtitles, a commentary by John Schlesinger and Julie Christie (not very interesting), a theatrical trailer and a 15 minutes excerpt from a BBC serie about british cinema (very interesting) are offered as bonus features.Tom Courtenay is William Fisher, a young man with problems. He doesn't like his job as a funeral furnishings employee, he still lives at his parents's home and spends a lot of time lying to his two girlfriends. In order to quit for a while his everyday life, he has created an imaginary world - Ambrosia - that has got some resemblance with the South or Central America bananas republics of the sixties. He is the leader of this country and people adore him. In short, he is an escapist.BILLY LIAR has been shot partly on location, partly in studio and I often had the feeling to watch two different movies on the screen. Like Billy. The destructions of buildings shown throughout the movie add to the strange impression that a world is collapsing. When Billy meets Liz, played by a terrific Julie Christie, he has the opportunity of his life to give some reality to his dreams because Liz is so real. Let's admire how John Schlesinger, in a french New Wave style, films her strolling in the streets.

Walters,"[36, 37]","&quot;Billy Liar&quot; was made in 1963 three years after my birth and I can just remember Britian being like this; but it is not just a nostalgia trip. This is a beautifully executed piece of film making works from the opening, when we see a nation's homemakers brought together by the BBC's &quot;Housewife's Choice&quot;, to the end when the battered and degected Billy walks up the hill to his parents semi-detached house at the head of his make believe army.In between we get to witness Billy's fantastic imagination at work vividly brought to life in mock news-reel form and the chaos of his real life as his past mistakes catch up and eventually overwelm him.The central problem Billy faces is one that most if not all young people experience at some time; the desire to do something great and become important and the feeling that they are being constrained and inhibited by the older generation's lack of vision.It is not easy to distinguish who is responsible for what.  The writers Wallis Hall and Keith Waterhouse obviously deserve a great deal of credit as they also wrote the novel and stage play but John Schlesenger's direction and the superb cast bring the film to life.Schlesenger came from a  BBC television background and the opening sequence as well as the Danny Boon character seem very authentic.  Danny Boon, played by Leslie Randall, is the type of British comedian that used to and in some cases still does, present game shows on television in the UK  complete with irritating catch phrases and over fimiliarity with  middle aged women. Intrestingly Wilfred Pickels, who plays Billy's father, was previously best known for his radio quiz show &quot;Have a Go&quot; but he is now best remembered  for his roll here.The great dicovery of the film has to be Julie Christie who breezes in and sweeps all before her checking her make-up in a C&amp;A mirror (their last store closed in the UK this year) and swinging her handbag as she walks down the street.  But it is her scenes with Tom Courtney's Billy where she comes alive.  Although the makers regard her as fantacy figure in fact she is the only one who accepts him for what he is and offeres him a means of escape.

581811,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B00005EBSB,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[8, 8]","""Billy Liar,"" directed by Oscar winner John Schlesinger (Best Director, 'Midnight Cowboy') is billed as a comedy, but to me is much more of a tragedy with bits of comedy thrown in here and there. Presented by The Criterion Collection, ""Billy Liar"" is a little treasure of a film that is worth seeing for many reasons, but one big one...JULIE CHRISTIE.Tom Courtenay gives an absolutely brilliant performance as Billy Fisher, an undertaker's assistant that lives with his parents and has two fiancees. Fisher longs for escape and constantly daydreams of being the leader of a country and of shooting people he doesn't like. He also has a problem with telling the  truth and frequently finds himself in jams that he must lie to get out of. This earns him the nickname Billy Liar, but not until much later in the film. Christie plays Liz, a free-spirited woman who has so little screen time but makes a very big impression on the audience.Any review you read of ""Billy Liar"" will mention how fantastic Julie Christie is. She's incredibly beautiful, incredibly talented, and steals the show. The movie is about 75% comedy and much of the first 3/4 of it play as a comedy, but I thought the last part of the film had a completely dramatic change of tone...Which, in my opinion, worked for the better. The end is especially tragic. ""Billy Liar"" is a fantastic film that few people have heard of that definitely needs to be seen by more people, I highly recommend it.GRADE: A",5,JULIE CHRISTIE!,1178150400,"05 3, 2007",2007,1467,"['Billy', 'Liar', 'directed', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'John', 'Schlesinger', 'Best', 'Director', ""'Midnight"", 'Cowboy', 'billed', 'comedy', 'much', 'more', 'tragedy', 'bits', 'comedy', 'thrown', 'here', 'there', 'Presented', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'Billy', 'Liar', 'little', 'treasure', 'film', 'worth', 'seeing', 'many', 'reasons', 'one', 'big', 'one', 'JULIE', 'CHRISTIE.Tom', 'Courtenay', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'Billy', 'Fisher', 'undertaker', 'assistant', 'parents', 'two', 'fiancees', 'Fisher', 'longs', 'escape', 'constantly', 'daydreams', 'being', 'leader', 'country', 'shooting', 'people', ""n't"", 'like', 'also', 'problem', 'telling', 'truth', 'frequently', 'jams', 'must', 'lie', 'get', 'nickname', 'Billy', 'Liar', 'not', 'much', 'later', 'film', 'Christie', 'Liz', 'free-spirited', 'woman', 'who', 'so', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'very', 'big', 'impression', 'audience.Any', 'review', 'read', 'Billy', 'Liar', 'will', 'mention', 'how', 'fantastic', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'incredibly', 'beautiful', 'incredibly', 'talented', 'show', 'movie', 'about', '75', '%', 'comedy', 'much', 'first', '3/4', 'play', 'comedy', 'thought', 'last', 'part', 'film', 'had', 'completely', 'dramatic', 'change', 'tone', 'Which', 'opinion', 'worked', 'better', 'end', 'especially', 'tragic', 'Billy', 'Liar', 'fantastic', 'film', 'few', 'people', 'have', 'heard', 'definitely', 'be', 'seen', 'more', 'people', 'highly', 'recommend', 'it.GRADE']",N/A

It is set in a small city in England in 1963, and Billy, the hero such as he is, is a young man working a dull desk job but wanting more. He wants to be a writer, but he has no story to tell. He has a fantasy world he retreats to, but even his fantasy lacks narrative. There are only events. His real life is stifling, and he is again and again trapped in the fabric of his own lies. Billy Liar lies constantly. He has two fiances he juggles awkwardly, steals petty cash from the office, and tells his parents he has been offered a scriptwriting job in London. Unlike the character Alfie in the 1966 film, Billy doesn't even seem to believe his own lies. They are expedients to get through the next day, the next hour, the next minute.It is hard to be sympathetic. The movie is full of people working dull jobs as dull England is being torn down and rebuilt into a more modern but equally dull England. To be fair, it might not be just Billy. Billy might have talent, though we see no evidence of this. Billy might find a proper place for himself in the world. He might just need to try elsewhere, without his history, his family and his friends holding him back. Liz, a home town girl who has escaped, offers him a path out. She has had adventures elsewhere. To her, London is just someplace you go to by train. For Billy, London is no more real than his imaginary land of Ambrosia.It is no spoiler to say that at the end of the film, Billy Liar has failed to launch. Liz leaves on the train without him.

To escape the drudgery of his life, Billy passes the time telling outrageous lies and fantasizing about his very own country where he is the beloved ruler and war hero.I must admit I didn't know this movie was considered a comedy until I read some reviews.  While the fantasy sequences are certainly amusing, Billy's day-to-day existence is lonely, unfulfilling, and depressing.  I found Tom Courtenay to be adequate but dull and unsympathetic.  On the other hand, Julie Christie is remarkably confident, mature, and charismatic and the screen really lights up during her few scenes.  The black and white movie was one of the first in the sixties to feature the working class in all its gritty glory. (I wish the DVD had had subtitles to help me with the thick north-of-England accents.)The movie is similar to Danny Kaye's The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, but the humor is much more subtle.

581815,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B00005EBSB,Stephanie De Pue,"[0, 0]","""Billy Liar,"" (1963), is generally considered a British comedy classic, as it adds some romance, some drama, and some sci-fi fantasy to its screwball beginnings.  It was written by the British novelist/screenwriter Keith Waterhouse, who unapologetically based it upon the Walter Mitty stories by the American humorist James Thurber.  As directed by John Schlesinger, (Darling), it gave the young Tom Courteney(The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner) the opportunity to show off the comic chops that have served him well throughout his long career.  It also introduced the luminous young Julie Christie, DARLING, when Topsy Jane, who had costarred as Courtenay's love interest in LONELINESS, became ill while filming.  And we know what became of Ms. Jane, though she can still be seen in some puzzling-to-me (that isn't Julie Christie!) long-shot sequences, principally at the beginning of the film. And we know what became of Ms. Christie; this picture made her a star, even though she had but 12 minutes of screen time. (The audience's first introduction to Christie's character ""Liz"" was shot cinema verite style on the streets of Bradford, where the story is set: we see the passersby turn their heads to follow her as they react to Christie's magnetism.)Courtenay plays Billy Fisher, a young man who lives at home in Bradford with his family.  Dad: Geoffrey, played by Wilfred Pickles; Mum, Alice, as played by Mona Washbourne; and Nana, as played by Ethel Griffies. (Courtenay, Washbourne, and Griffies are recreating their original London stage roles.) (Albert Finney had created the title role of Billy Liar on the stage, before Courtenay took it over, but Schlesinger chose Courteney to play the lead of his film, as Courtenay was a less physically imposing presence than Finney and therefore, the director  thought, was more believable as a dreamer.)  Finlay Currie, (Whisky Galore), plays Duxbury; Leonard Rossiter, (The Fall & Rise of Reginald Perrin: The Complete Series), is Emanuel Shadrack, the undertaker who employs Billy; George Innes, (Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World [Blu-ray]) is Stamp.The black and white, 98 minute film certainly features a gallery of the best-known and loved British comic actors of the time; it gave George Innes his first role in a feature film.  It figured prominently in the transition from the glum ""kitchen sink"" realism that had previously characterized British cinema to the much more optimistic 60s.  And, as a low-budget film, it was shot on the streets of Bradford: you can see the era's cars, milk floats; World War II bomb damage versus Victorian grandeur, 60s tower blocks rising as older housing falls.Billy is a lazy, emotionally immature and irresponsible young British clerk who works in Shadrack's gloomy office. It's the dawn of the Swinging 60s, and Billy is bombarded daily by the media's self-serving, transparently false propaganda that all things are anyone's for the asking.  This bombardment, as coupled with Billy's boring job and his unbridled imagination, leads him on frequent flights to the mythical kingdom of ""Ambrosia,"" where the young man can be anything he wants to be: king, general, respected novelist, debonair playboy.  Meanwhile, as he confuses his fantasy life with real life, he's alienating friends, girlfriends, family, his employer.  He's become engaged to two different girls, simultaneously, while he's actually in love with a third, Liz, as played by Christie. And he's spent rather a large amount of his firm's postage money on his personal desires. And last, but not least, his dream of escaping from it all, becoming a highly-paid, famous scriptwriter in London seems simply pathetic.Well, the movie's got nostalgia for place and period going for it, and it can be quirky and thought-provoking.  I remember being much taken with it on its first release, way back in 1963, real time, but I found it rather painful now.  It seemed like all concerned were struggling just to fill up that 98 minute running time.  Furthermore, I sure don't have the hearing ability I had way back then.  The picture lacks subtitles, and the cast has been encouraged to trot out its best Yorkshire accents; as high as I could turn up my TV's volume, all the way to 99, I missed most of the dialog.

It stands in a tradition of many great British movies that managed to make something truly cinematic out of stage material (another outstanding example would be David Lean's 1945 'Brief Encounter').The film follows a young man of 19 by the name of Billy Fisher. In the small Yorkshire town of Stradhoughton (fictional I am sure), Billy copes with the mundanity of everyday life by creating for himself an inner world of fantasy to which he retreats continually. Courtenay is superb as the perpetual liar and daydreamer, and the supporting cast is equally excellent. Denys Coop's photography. Is reminiscent of the French New Wave, particularly the opening scenes which echo the opening of Truffaut's 'Les 400 Coups,' the beautiful scenes of Julie Christie as she skips her way through the streets, and the final shots of Billy's street which have a 'cinema verite' look. The editing, especially in the fantasy sequences, brings a uniquely cinematic dimension to what could have easily been done in a more cliched style.Schlesinger presents a very moving, and very human, fable. Towards the end, as Billy marches through the empty streets, humming the last post, following the death of his grandmother, there is a real air of pathos. Similarly, we get interesting insights into the character of Billy as, waiting to board the train to London, he clutches two cartons of milk to his chest, a touching maternal symbol. Again, there are clear echoes of the scene in Truffaut's 'Les 400 Coups' in which the young Antoine Doinel steals, having run away from home, steals a bottle of milk from a doorway.This is not to say that the film is an incredibly sophisticated look into characters and personalities, but it touches upon some very human and profound moments. This is also a tremendously witty film, not losing on iota of the humour and irony of the original book by Keith Waterhouse (and subsequent stage play co-authored by Willis Hall). There are scenes of laugh-out-loud hilarity, and many of Billy's fantasies will strike a chord with many of the more imaginative of us, perhaps making us uncomfortable as we see a reflection of ourselves, albeit on a bigger scale.",5,"Engaging, Entertaining, Thoughtful, Cinematic",999820800,"09 7, 2001",2001,2217,"['am', 'full', 'admiration', 'Schlesinger', 'film', 'tradition', 'many', 'great', 'British', 'movies', 'managed', 'make', 'something', 'truly', 'cinematic', 'stage', 'material', 'outstanding', 'example', 'would', 'be', 'David', 'Lean', '1945', ""'Brief"", 'Encounter', '.The', 'film', 'young', 'man', '19', 'name', 'Billy', 'Fisher', 'small', 'Yorkshire', 'town', 'Stradhoughton', 'fictional', 'am', 'sure', 'Billy', 'mundanity', 'everyday', 'life', 'creating', 'inner', 'world', 'fantasy', 'continually', 'Courtenay', 'superb', 'perpetual', 'liar', 'daydreamer', 'supporting', 'cast', 'equally', 'excellent', 'Denys', 'Coop', 'photography', 'reminiscent', 'French', 'New', 'Wave', 'particularly', 'opening', 'scenes', 'echo', 'opening', 'Truffaut', '400', 'Coups', 'beautiful', 'scenes', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'way', 'streets', 'final', 'shots', 'Billy', 'street', 'have', ""'cinema"", 'verite', 'look', 'editing', 'especially', 'fantasy', 'sequences', 'uniquely', 'cinematic', 'dimension', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'done', 'more', 'cliched', 'style.Schlesinger', 'very', 'moving', 'very', 'human', 'fable', 'end', 'Billy', 'empty', 'streets', 'humming', 'last', 'post', 'following', 'death', 'grandmother', 'real', 'air', 'pathos', 'Similarly', 'get', 'interesting', 'insights', 'character', 'Billy', 'waiting', 'board', 'train', 'London', 'two', 'cartons', 'milk', 'chest', 'touching', 'maternal', 'symbol', 'Again', 'are', 'clear', 'echoes', 'scene', 'Truffaut', '400', 'Coups', 'young', 'Antoine', 'Doinel', 'steals', 'having', 'run', 'away', 'home', 'bottle', 'milk', 'doorway.This', 'not', 'say', 'film', 'incredibly', 'sophisticated', 'look', 'characters', 'personalities', 'very', 'human', 'profound', 'moments', 'also', 'tremendously', 'witty', 'film', 'not', 'losing', 'iota', 'humour', 'irony', 'original', 'book', 'Keith', 'Waterhouse', 'subsequent', 'stage', 'play', 'co-authored', 'Willis', 'Hall', 'are', 'scenes', 'laugh-out-loud', 'hilarity', 'many', 'Billy', 'fantasies', 'will', 'strike', 'chord', 'many', 'more', 'imaginative', 'perhaps', 'making', 'uncomfortable', 'see', 'reflection', 'ourselves', 'albeit', 'bigger', 'scale']",N/A
