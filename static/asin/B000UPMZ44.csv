Szilagy ""Joe Szilagy""","[5, 6]","Yes, yes, this is truly great stuff, but sooner or later you have to come back down to Earth, (or, back to the present). What I'm saying is, this series is superb, and takes you ""there"", at least as much as we can expect. There's tons of realistic-looking/moving dinosaurs,(except with ""all"" dinosaur documentaries and movies- never try and make a Tyrannosaur or Allosaur ""leap"" into the air after something!), and you might just be amazed on occasion, but I would highly recommend you also get the ""Discovery Essential Dinosaur Pack"" to perfectly compliment this set. The Discovery set also includes plenty of great ""being there"" dinosaur stuff as well, but also incorporates plenty of actual scientific research, and how things are analysed through various stages as shown and explained by many world-renowned paleontologists.Both sets are great!",5,"GREAT!
