It is nothing like the ones of role changing that have been done in American movies. They were stupid. This story make you laugh and cry. Constant cliff hangers and the end left me breathless.

Not to mentioned he's good-looking and has a dimple smile that can slay you. Having said that, I'm still trying to finish this one. I have about 5 episodes to go. My problem was not with Hyun, it was his leading lady. I'm having a problem with her ROLE.  Writers pay attention, how can she go almost the whole drama playing hard to get? When does it end?  When will they ever grow as a couple to put more meat in their roles? It's just repetitive at this point and hard for me to get through it. On top of that, it's not very believable. Hyun Bin plays a young, handsome, wealthy man whose the CEO of a chain of shopping malls. His mother wants him to settle down and get marries, so she's constantly setting him up on blind dates. He rejects each and every one of these beautiful women (always the case) and instead falls for a  poor, plain woman, who works as a stunt double, whom he just happens meet when he mistakes her for the leading actress. Sounds like Cinderella, right. WRONG. She rejects him time and time again. As I said earlier, I am long pass ten episodes and he's still chasing her down.

1456091,A2EPMY2KVT8MZT,B005DU58Q8,Chicagoan,"[0, 0]","A mesmerizing romantic comedy of a poor stuntwoman who is mistaken to be a movie actress by a corporate CEO.  Once they discover the mistake, they part.  But the CEO cannot get her out of his mind.  Several love triangles develop (real and imagined) with them which include a fading pop star (the CEO's cousin), two directors and others.  The story revolves mostly around the stuntwoman and the CEO and highlights the differences between the cultures of the poor and the privileged.  There is a bit a magic in the story when they sometimes switch bodies.  And there are many subplots during the 20 hour story.Everything about this is near perfect including the story, acting (especially the 4 leads), casting, directing, and pace.

We noticed on Netflix that the KDramas were there and that made it easier to get in and watch one.  So I was working from home and decided to put one on.  This was the one I picked because it sounded interesting.  Boy was it ever.  I have now watched numerous other Kdramas as well.  I bought Secret Garden because to me it is still just one of the best I have seen.The leads have excellent chemistry and if you are not touched by Ha Ji Won you have no heart.  This also has excellent background characters and no one is really weak.  The truth is that if they took the drama of the supporting characters it could have made a drama as well and probably extremely watchable.  Having watched quite a few that can tend to be a weakness in the whole genre in that other than the mains they do not do enough to flesh out the side characters.  Here they spend the time to flesh out 6-8 characters fairly well.For US audiences, this is a romantic comedy.  We have kind of lost the art of making fun romantic comedies here because we either go way to sweet and sickly or we make it way too real.  That middle sarcastic battling has been lost to a large extent and its a shame that it has.  I adore a good romantic comedy.  I love the Thin Man and many of its follow ups (although they were not all good) because they showed a complex but fun relationship between adults without going to sweet or talking down to anyone.  This KDrama and several others that I have enjoyed (My Lovely Samsoon,1st Shop of Coffee Prince) are really striking that perfect chord.

Loved the action scenes with all the cool martial arts and line work.  Hyun Bin plays his role of a slightly bent and geeky chaebol with remarkable finesse.  The word play between the two is fun and keeps the tempo up while they get to know one another.The supernatural stuff was a little out there, but it helped that there was a slightly tongue in cheek air to most of it.

1456103,A209J4NK7GR9S3,B005DU58Q8,Lovely D.M.,"[1, 1]","The first time I watched this show, I liked it but didn't love it. Recently I watched it again, watching mostly all the H/h parts, and I realized that I loved it. The H/h in this show have some fantastic moments.The premise of the story is very interesting and the show is overall solid. This is a memorable romance/drama with a touch of magic and a dash of heartbreak, completed with a comedic streak. Joo Won, an eccentric CEO is sort of obsessed with Ra Im (a poor stunt-double woman who has a soft heart), the moment he sees her. He doesn't know why he keeps seeing her in his imagination, thinking about her, and wanting to be with her. All he knows is that he can't get her out of his mind, and he has to have her. The heroine is sweet, but she tries to protect herself with a brash front.The very last scene which is a flashback (that the hero himself had forgotten for a good portion of the show), explains why the hero couldn't get the heroine out of his mind after that. This show has a happy ending (marriage and children), but this flashback which is the very last scene of this show made me teary (it was so moving, and shows the connection our H/h had).The body swap thing is only a small part of this 20 episode show (and I'm glad for that), it starts in episode 5 and ends in episode 8. Then it happens again (because they switch every time it rains) in episode 14/15. The last time is episode 17 and this is the most heartbreaking episode of this show. After that the body switch magic ends, and they're both back to their own bodies for good.The cons of this show is that the conflict that kept the H/h apart was sort of weak, and Joo Won's mother was cartoonishly evil and one dimensional. A few parts with Oska's storyline, and some action school parts, were slow. However this show has a great OST and great H/h moments (despite the fact that the hero can be a big jerk at some parts), and an overall unique and solid plot.Secret Garden has become one of my very favorite shows.",5,Memorable...4.5 Stars,1353369600,"11 20, 2012",2012,1999,"['first', 'time', 'watched', 'show', 'liked', 'did', ""n't"", 'love', 'Recently', 'watched', 'again', 'watching', 'mostly', 'H/h', 'parts', 'realized', 'loved', 'H/h', 'show', 'have', 'fantastic', 'moments.The', 'premise', 'story', 'very', 'interesting', 'show', 'overall', 'solid', 'memorable', 'romance/drama', 'touch', 'magic', 'dash', 'heartbreak', 'completed', 'comedic', 'streak', 'Joo', 'Won', 'eccentric', 'CEO', 'sort', 'obsessed', 'Ra', 'Im', 'poor', 'stunt-double', 'woman', 'who', 'soft', 'heart', 'moment', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'seeing', 'imagination', 'thinking', 'wanting', 'be', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'mind', 'have', 'heroine', 'sweet', 'protect', 'brash', 'front.The', 'very', 'last', 'scene', 'flashback', 'hero', 'had', 'forgotten', 'good', 'portion', 'show', 'why', 'hero', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'heroine', 'mind', 'show', 'happy', 'ending', 'marriage', 'children', 'flashback', 'very', 'last', 'scene', 'show', 'made', 'teary', 'was', 'so', 'moving', 'connection', 'H/h', 'had', '.The', 'body', 'swap', 'thing', 'only', 'small', 'part', '20', 'episode', 'show', ""'m"", 'glad', 'episode', '5', 'ends', 'episode', '8', 'Then', 'again', 'switch', 'time', 'episode', '14/15', 'last', 'time', 'episode', '17', 'most', 'heartbreaking', 'episode', 'show', 'body', 'switch', 'magic', 'ends', ""'re"", 'back', 'own', 'bodies', 'good.The', 'cons', 'show', 'conflict', 'kept', 'H/h', 'apart', 'was', 'sort', 'weak', 'Joo', 'Won', 'mother', 'was', 'cartoonishly', 'evil', 'one', 'dimensional', 'few', 'parts', 'Oska', 'storyline', 'action', 'school', 'parts', 'were', 'slow', 'However', 'show', 'great', 'OST', 'great', 'H/h', 'moments', 'fact', 'hero', 'can', 'be', 'big', 'jerk', 'parts', 'overall', 'unique', 'solid', 'plot.Secret', 'Garden', 'become', 'one', 'very', 'favorite', 'shows']",Secret Garden

1456109,A188NTJ5LV8LA4,B005DU58Q8,Wm19,"[0, 0]","I've never watched a Korean drama before, but when I saw it on Netflix with English subtitles, I decided to give it a try.  Apparently it's one of the best Korean dramas out there.It's a 20 episode tv series, an hour per episode, about a very acerbic, rich, arrogant CEO who crosses paths with a hardworking, poor, stuntwoman.  He's got a high IQ, but his EQ is sorely lacking. She fascinates him, so he keeps on going back to her even when he looks down on her.The heroine is someone that I can admire. She is an ethical, hardworking woman who was orphaned, but managed to build a meaningful life for herself and make many close friends. She is poor, but dignified and kind. She is not impressed by the hero's snotty attitude or his wealth. With her quick stuntwoman reflexes, she is swift to kick or throw down the hero when he oversteps his boundaries or mortally insults her poverty, lack of education or lack of family (as he is wont to do).The hero is brilliant in his aristocrat sphere where he understands high society dynamics and high class women's psyche. He's got wealthy, rich, beautiful high society women throwing themselves at him hoping for marriage, but he's totally cool, composed and unimpressed. Then he meets the heroine and is inexplicably fascinated by her. He follows her around trying to figure out why he's so interested in her, even coming up with lame excuses to see her..  Thinking he is just some country bumpkin (because he is so clueless) who keeps on pestering her, she gives him several verbal and physical setdowns. He is utterly confused by his fascination by her (he even asks his cousin why he looks forward to getting beaten by her), and tries to overcome it by reciting verse, in the manner of Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy fencing in London, thinking, ""I must overcome this (fascination with an unsuitable woman!)"".  Awesome.He's utterly clueless to the reality of working class women. For example, when the heroine tries to hide a mild injury because she is humble, doesn't want to make a fuss, and wants to continue working, he is shocked and incredulous because none of the women he knows would do that. He's so quirky and crazy in what he says that he's very comedic.  There are several running gags in the story, and my favourite is his sparkly tracksuit (especially the jail scene).He gets his comeuppance when he falls madly in love with her and learns humility.  It sure helps when she gives him well deserved set downs whenever he gets out of hand. There are some reviewers who are uncomfortable with the few scenes where he restrains her so he can ask her questions or hug her - but honestly, the heroine is so fit and skilled in martial arts that she can kick his butt six ways to sunday, so she's actually passively letting him get his way so she can figure out what he wants. I'm sure that if anybody else did that, she'd quickly dispose of them (as she later does with some opposing bodyguards).The wonderful dialogue, sizzling chemistry, class conflict and storyline were great. It actually reminded me a lot of Pride and Prejudice, Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle style.I watched the entire first episode and I was hooked.  I finished the series in only a few days. The series is very funny, charming, and romantic.  There's a body switch in there, in the style of Freaky Friday, which adds to the laughs.The supporting cast is stellar, too.  There's the comedic secretary, the ambitious villian, the charming playboy music star cousin with a heart of gold, the beautiful high society musical director, the warm hearted roommate, the evil potential mother in law, etc.The music is great, and after watching the entire 20 hour series, I went to itunes and downloaded some of the signature sountrack songs (just look up ""secret garden television"" in music - it's a 2 disc CD).  I like the side stories in this series too.  The singer star cousin, Oska, is hilarious and charming, particular in his relationship with the heroine that drives the hero up the wall.I'm not familiar with Korean culture, so there are some things that are odd, but charming in the story. For example, they wear slippers inside their homes, sit on the floor to eat at low tables, bow to each other frequently, have some very odd men's hairstyles, and apparently there are many class distinctions in how their forms of speech to each other. Also, I've since learned that Korea has ""chaebols"", family conglomerates that control entire industries and wield vast power and wealth. These rich families tend to have arranged marriages with each other, and the hero is a prime example of what the scion of a chaebol would be like. They seem a lot like rich aristocrats in 1800's Great Britain, which is why the class differences are so stark.By the time the characters fall in love, I was in tears - the story was that great!  Although their chemistry and flirting was awesome, they managed to convey an incredible love for each other through their acting, sacrifices, and a few modest kisses. So most of the film is funny and entertaining, and only at the climax does it become more tears and drama before the final denouement.(The VVIP party scene was my favourite, but I won't say anymore because I don't want to give out any major spoilers.)Very cute, a highly recommended romantic comedy.  I'm now watching the entire series a second time...***I've now watched two other Korean dramas, and it makes me admire this couple's chemistry, the hero's love, and the heroine's character even more.  The other two dramas had annoyingly immature girls who acted as greedy, vulgar caricatures of poor people, and heroes who were either immorally cruel or had no chemistry at all. Secret Garden had mature, adult, yet very cute leads with great chemistry***",5,Loved it - my first Korean drama!,1392163200,"02 12, 2014",2014,5768,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'watched', 'Korean', 'drama',
