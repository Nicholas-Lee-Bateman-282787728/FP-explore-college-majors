206305,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,6300185850,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[0, 0]","I am usually very apprehensive to watch movie versions of theatre plays, and it is rare that a performance is pulled off to perfection.  This was it!  Superb performances, true to the dramatic plot, and complete with intensive moods required to pull it off.  And, when I knew that two impressive actors would portray the characters, Sissy Spacek and Anne Bancroft as Thelma, the mother of Jessie, a young lady planning her suicide, carefully, strategically and nonchalantly.  The story takes place in the home with just two people, and all in one night, within a matter of a couple of hours. There is no musical soundtrack to draw from the moods.Pulitzer Prize by Marsha Norman'Night Mother.Marsha Norman won the Pulitzer Prize in 1983, and when I learned she did the Screenplay for the movie, I was more confident the performance would be first class.  If you haven't read the book, do so, it is riveting, unlike something you may have read in drama.A right to dieJessie is divorced and has a juvenile son whose whereabouts are unknown.  She caretakes for her mother, Thelma and has a brother Dawson and his family who live nearby.  In her lifetime, Jessie has had epileptic seizures, her husband Cecil left her and she moved back with her mother.  She feels like a failure.  But it is this night, after plans to do her mother's manicure, that Jessie plans go to her bedroom and kill herself.  It is her right, as she is tired, hurt, sad, and feels used. Throughout, you will learn of the past.Stages of grief - for the livingIn 1969, Dr. Elizabeth Kubler-Ross wrote the groundbreaking book,On Death and Dying (Scribner Classics)and named the five stages of grief that people who are dying go through, and not in an exact order.  The five stages are denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance.  What we see is Thelma, going through these stages, denying that the suicide will happen, angry attempting to stop it, bargaining with Jessie to stay alive, depressed and down with this reality.This is an emotional, powerful film with exceptional performances....Rizzo",5,Superb and riveting performances!,1225065600,"10 27, 2008",2008,2073,"['am', 'usually', 'very', 'apprehensive', 'watch', 'movie', 'versions', 'theatre', 'plays', 'rare', 'performance', 'pulled', 'off', 'perfection', 'was', 'Superb', 'performances', 'true', 'dramatic', 'plot', 'complete', 'intensive', 'moods', 'required', 'pull', 'off', 'when', 'knew', 'two', 'impressive', 'actors', 'would', 'portray', 'characters', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'Anne', 'Bancroft', 'Thelma', 'mother', 'Jessie', 'young', 'lady', 'planning', 'suicide', 'carefully', 'strategically', 'nonchalantly', 'story', 'place', 'home', 'just', 'two', 'people', 'one', 'night', 'matter', 'couple', 'hours', 'musical', 'soundtrack', 'draw', 'moods.Pulitzer', 'Prize', 'Marsha', ""Norman'Night"", 'Mother.Marsha', 'Norman', 'won', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize', '1983', 'when', 'learned', 'did', 'Screenplay', 'movie', 'was', 'more', 'confident', 'performance', 'would', 'be', 'first', 'class', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'do', 'so', 'riveting', 'something', 'may', 'have', 'read', 'drama.A', 'right', 'dieJessie', 'divorced', 'juvenile', 'son', 'whereabouts', 'are', 'unknown', 'mother', 'Thelma', 'brother', 'Dawson', 'family', 'who', 'live', 'nearby', 'lifetime', 'Jessie', 'had', 'epileptic', 'seizures', 'husband', 'Cecil', 'left', 'moved', 'back', 'mother', 'failure', 'night', 'plans', 'do', 'mother', 'manicure', 'Jessie', 'go', 'bedroom', 'kill', 'right', 'tired', 'hurt', 'sad', 'feels', 'used', 'Throughout', 'will', 'learn', 'past.Stages', 'grief', 'livingIn', '1969', 'Dr.', 'Elizabeth', 'Kubler-Ross', 'wrote', 'groundbreaking', 'book', 'Death', 'Dying', 'Scribner', 'Classics', 'named', 'five', 'stages', 'grief', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'dying', 'go', 'not', 'exact', 'order', 'five', 'stages', 'are', 'denial', 'anger', 'bargaining', 'depression', 'acceptance', 'What', 'see', 'Thelma', 'going', 'stages', 'denying', 'suicide', 'will', 'happen', 'angry', 'attempting', 'stop', 'bargaining', 'Jessie', 'stay', 'alive', 'depressed', 'down', 'reality.This', 'emotional', 'powerful', 'film', 'exceptional', 'performances', '.Rizzo']",N/A

Cissy Spacek is a divorced woman in her late 30s who is an epileptic with a son who is on his way to becoming a criminal. She is living with her mother (Anne Bancroft) and that night plans on killing herself. Throughout the whole movie Spacek and Bancroft talk about their lives and Spacek's decision as if she were going to the dentist for a root canal. Bancroft rants and raves at times, but that is just a mild interruption to the placid movement of time until the evening when Spacek shoots herself. Spacek has simply come to the conclusion that this is the only course of action open to her, but that decision never comes across as convincing--which makes the whole thing seem like such a waste. Also since it is basically the Marsha Norman play converted to the screen, it is very stagey and visually undramatic.

206308,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,6300185850,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[11, 13]","Written for the stage by Marsha Norman, 'NIGHT, MOTHER opened on Broadway in 1983 with Anne Pitoniak and Kathy Bates in the roles of Thelma and Jessie Cates.  It proved a stunning success with critics and audiences alike, running 380 performances, receiving the 1983 Pulitzer Prize for Drama, a Tony award for Best Play, and Tony nominations for Pitoniak, Bates, and director Tom Moore.In 1986 Marsha Norman herself adapted the play to film.  The roles of Thelma and Jessie went to Anne Bancroft and Sissy Spacek, and in the process of writing--and possibly under pressure from producers--Norman expanded the original play to include characters mentioned but never seen.  The result was something slightly less than ideal.  Spacek is perfectly cast as the suicidal Jessie, but although she gives an excellent performance Bancroft is intrinsically miscast in the role of Jessie's ""plain country woman"" mother.  The expansion of the original story also has the effect of diluting the claustrophobic intensity of the original.  As for director Tom Moore, although his work for the play was memorable, his work with the film was unremarkable.But unexpectedly, such is the power of the story's basic premise that these flaws hardly matter.  Watered down, fiddled with, and somewhat miscast, 'NIGHT, MOTHER is still a knock-you-flat story that raises the sort of questions that keep you awake on a sleepless night.  Thelma is an ordinary, uneducated woman who takes life as it comes; Jessie, however, is an uneasy mixture of introspection and uncertainty, a woman whose marriage failed when she developed epilepsy, whose son has become a bit of gutter trash, who has over the years become a recluse in her mother's home.  She's tired of the whole thing, and on this particular evening she informs her mother that in a few hours she's going to shoot herself and put an end to it.Like the play, the film is essentially an emotional explosion between the two women, Jessie spelling out her reasons for her suicide, Thelma working to turn Jessie from it.  Although the suspense of the film arises from a ""Will she do it or not?"" situation, the real interest here is in Jessie's motivations, the how and why of her decision, and the tactics that Thelma uses in an effort to bring Jessie's plans to a grinding halt, and the way they battle each other over the course of the film.  The interest is in the characters, plain and simple.As noted, Bancroft is not ideally cast here.  It is extremely difficult to accept her in the role of Thelma Cates.  Even so, Bancroft gives it all she has--and the end result is quite powerful as acting pure and simple, a remarkable feat.  But the real powerhouse here is Spacek: we believe her, never question her in the role, and buy into it from start to finish.  Even with Bancroft's miscasting, the dilution of the play, and the uninspired direction, Spacek's performance is more than enough to render the film powerful, memorable.This is not a film that I casually recommend.  It rather depends on the viewer's life experiences, and I would hardly send it off to a person in a depressed state of mind or one who had a suicide in the family.  But it is worth the trouble it takes to seek out, particularly if it leads you on to reading the play itself--or better yet, seeing a stage production of the same.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",4,Dead Is Dead Quiet: A Flawed But Memorable Film Version Of The Celebrated Play,1170288000,"02 1, 2007",2007,3352,"['Written', 'stage', 'Marsha', 'Norman', ""'NIGHT"", 'MOTHER', 'opened', 'Broadway', '1983', 'Anne', 'Pitoniak', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'roles', 'Thelma', 'Jessie', 'Cates', 'proved', 'stunning', 'success', 'critics', 'audiences', 'alike', 'running', '380', 'performances', 'receiving', '1983', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize', 'Drama', 'Tony', 'award', 'Best', 'Play', 'Tony', 'nominations', 'Pitoniak', 'Bates', 'director', 'Tom', 'Moore.In', '1986', 'Marsha', 'Norman', 'adapted', 'play', 'film', 'roles', 'Thelma', 'Jessie', 'went', 'Anne', 'Bancroft', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'process', 'writing', 'possibly', 'pressure', 'producers', 'Norman', 'expanded', 'original', 'play', 'include', 'characters', 'mentioned', 'never', 'seen', 'result', 'was', 'something', 'slightly', 'less', 'ideal', 'Spacek', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'suicidal', 'Jessie', 'excellent', 'performance', 'Bancroft', 'intrinsically', 'miscast', 'role', 'Jessie', 'plain', 'country', 'woman', 'mother', 'expansion', 'original', 'story', 'also', 'effect', 'diluting', 'claustrophobic', 'intensity', 'original', 'director', 'Tom', 'Moore', 'work', 'play', 'was', 'memorable', 'work', 'film', 'was', 'unremarkable.But', 'unexpectedly', 'such', 'power', 'story', 'basic', 'premise', 'flaws', 'hardly', 'matter', 'Watered', 'down', 'fiddled', 'somewhat', 'miscast', 'MOTHER', 'still', 'knock-you-flat', 'story', 'sort', 'questions', 'keep', 'awake', 'sleepless', 'night', 'Thelma', 'ordinary', 'uneducated', 'woman', 'who', 'life', 'Jessie', 'however', 'uneasy', 'mixture', 'introspection', 'uncertainty', 'woman', 'marriage', 'failed', 'when', 'developed', 'epilepsy', 'son', 'become', 'bit', 'gutter', 'trash', 'who', 'years', 'become', 'recluse', 'mother', 'home', 'tired', 'whole', 'thing', 'particular', 'evening', 'mother', 'few', 'hours', 'going', 'shoot', 'put', 'end', 'it.Like', 'play', 'film', 'essentially', 'emotional', 'explosion', 'two', 'women', 'Jessie', 'spelling', 'out', 'reasons', 'suicide', 'Thelma', 'working', 'turn', 'Jessie', 'suspense', 'film', 'Will', 'do', 'not', 'situation', 'real', 'interest', 'here', 'Jessie', 'motivations', 'how', 'why', 'decision', 'tactics', 'Thelma', 'effort', 'bring', 'Jessie', 'plans', 'grinding', 'halt', 'way', 'battle', 'other', 'course', 'film', 'interest', 'characters', 'plain', 'simple.As', 'noted', 'Bancroft', 'not', 'ideally', 'cast', 'here', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'accept', 'role', 'Thelma', 'Cates', 'Even', 'so', 'Bancroft', 'end', 'result', 'quite', 'powerful', 'acting', 'pure', 'simple', 'remarkable', 'feat', 'real', 'powerhouse', 'here', 'Spacek', 'believe', 'never', 'question', 'role', 'buy', 'start', 'finish', 'Even', 'Bancroft', 'miscasting', 'dilution', 'play', 'uninspired', 'direction', 'Spacek', 'performance', 'more', 'enough', 'render', 'film', 'powerful', 'memorable.This', 'not', 'film', 'casually', 'recommend', 'rather', 'viewer', 'life', 'experiences', 'would', 'hardly', 'send', 'off', 'person', 'depressed', 'state', 'mind', 'one', 'who', 'had', 'suicide', 'family', 'trouble', 'seek', 'out', 'particularly', 'reading', 'play', 'better', 'yet', 'seeing', 'stage', 'production', 'same.GFT', 'Amazon', 'Reviewer']",N/A

206311,A1W6AMIGHPX3UQ,6300185850,J. Merritt,"[21, 24]","It's a shame that ""'Night, Mother"" (1986) isn't currently available on DVD in a U.S.-friendly format. Adapted by Marsha Norman from her own Pulitzer Prize-winning stage drama, the film stars Anne Bancroft as Thelma Cates and Sissy Spacek as her daughter Jessie, who basically has to run her mother's life. About ten minutes in, Jessie matter-of-factly reveals that this will change, because she's decided to shoot herself on this particular night. She does not immediately disclose why. The remainder of the film consists of Jessie calmly explaining to Thelma how to manage her own affairs, while Thelma goes through a rainbow of emotions trying to come to terms with her daughter's decision.Norman and director Tom Moore have done little to open up this story from its stage origins. The camera never really leaves the house, and except from a distance or over a phone, we never hear or see anyone else besides these two characters. The filmic claustrophobia might have been intentional, however, as a visual punctuation of Jessie's cramped existence, and at any rate it's a small gripe when balanced against the tour-de-force acting that we get to witness. It would be difficult to overrate Spacek, who has now spent 40 years giving one amazing performance after another, while Bancroft was always a bit underrated, too often labeled as simply a gifted comedienne. She was much more, and this film offers abundant proof. As we watch her navigate a tidal wave of emotional highs and lows, swinging from anger to frustration to hope to reproof in an effort to change Jessie's mind, her talent is such that we feel ourselves riding the wave right along with her. Spacek, meanwhile, deftly balances her mother's expected hysteria and maintains her resolve, while slowly but surely opening up small doors that reveal her motivations to end her own life. When the moment of truth finally arrives, it is shattering even while expected.Long overdue for an American release. If it comes on cable, don't miss it.Trivia Side Note: When the play originally ran on Broadway in 1983, Kathy Bates played the part of Jessie and received a Tony nomination. It would be fascinating to see her now play the part of Thelma.

The story line is difficult to say the least.  A woman determined to kill herself and the mother (who loves her more than anyone else in this world) trying desperately to find a way to stop it from happening.  If suicide is too distressing a subject for you, do not watch this film.  If you are thinking of suicide, do not watch this film. It evidences how someone can convince themselves that this is the right choice (which it is not), but hopefully it also points to the fact that a suicide always deeply, adversely and irreversibly affects someone else in this world, even if it's just the person who finds the body (I know of which I speak).  This movie may be boring for some, but only because of the film style.  It is, as one reviewer said, like watching a play.  It is almost what you might see if someone just took out a video camera and made a home movie of the lives of these two people in the last hours of Jesse's life.

At first mother does not believe (or want) her, and they carry on with their menial tasks, such as planning for a manicure, changing sofa covers and so on. During the meantime, the daughter is asking her real questions about whether she loved her father, and the mother answers with simple answers that minimize her feelings.In short, Mother is in denial that Jessie is going to kill herself and resorts to making things better around the house for her, like not doing laundry, and other tasks. When that does not work, she blames her epilepsy and her divorce or the fact the she does not leave the house much. The problem is that Mother is not listening to Jessie when she tells her she is tired and wants to get off the bus. Things are not going to get any better, she has been constantly thinking about suicide for a year.There has been total lack of communication between them for the exception of gossip and recipes. Her mental status has worsened and ignored by her Mother who should have gotten her some help.

I'm still trying to decide whather it was a mistake or not. The first five minutes made me think so-- for one thing, I knew I was in for trouble when I saw &quot;produced by Aaron Spelling,&quot; and for another, the syrupy, bucolic music (supplied by TV music guru David Shire, who's about a half-step above Yanni on the subtlety scale) makes a mockery of the play's subject matter: a late-thirtysomething divorcee, Jessie (Sissy Spacek) tells her mother (Anne Bancroft) that she's going to kill herself in a few hours, and the two of them go back and forth about the decision while reliving memories and having heart-to-hearts about various topics. The play is notable for being one of the first, and still one fo the only, level-headed looks at suicide in American literature, and after that first bit is out of the way (it actuallycontinues on about fifteen minutes after the opening credits, and none of it's in the play), we get down to the brass tacks of Ms. Norman's contest of wills between a woman who's tired of life and a mother who's too scared to be tired of life. And it's fantastic. Spacek and Bancroft both play their roles to the hilt, and while the dialogue isn't quite as intense in the film as it is in the play (cameras being what they are, the characters are allowed to move about the house, where the play takes place almost completely in two rooms), it still works extremely well. And then comes the end of the play... and David Shire works his magic once again, wrecking the film's effect. (The movie also emphasizes one line I managed to pass over in the play, during Bancroft's last speech, that's just plain bad, and one wonders why Norman, who adapted her own play for the screen, allowed it to remain.)Fast forward through the first twenty minutes (up to where Spacek asks Bancroft where the gun is, which opens the play) and stop at the last line of the play (&quot;Loretta? Let me speak to Dawson, honey.&quot;) and you've got a decent adaptation of an excellent play. ***",3,good performances marred by extraneous material,992822400,"06 18, 2001",2001,2150,"[""'night"", 'Mother', 'Tom', 'Moore', '1986', 'Having', 'just', 'finished', 'reading', 'Marsha', 'Norman', 'wonderful', 'Pulitzer-winning', 'play', 'figured', ""'d"", 'check', 'out', 'movie', ""'m"", 'still', 'trying', 'decide', 'whather', 'was', 'mistake', 'not', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'made', 'think', 'so', 'one', 'thing', 'knew', 'was', 'trouble', 'when', 'saw', 'quot', 'produced', 'Aaron', 'Spelling', 'quot', 'syrupy', 'bucolic', 'music', 'supplied', 'TV', 'music', 'guru', 'David', 'Shire', 'who', 'half-step', 'Yanni', 'subtlety', 'scale', 'mockery', 'play', 'subject', 'matter', 'late-thirtysomething', 'divorcee', 'Jessie', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'mother', 'Anne', 'Bancroft', 'going', 'kill', 'few', 'hours', 'two', 'go', 'back', 'forth', 'decision', 'reliving', 'memories', 'having', 'heart-to-hearts', 'various', 'topics', 'play', 'notable', 'being', 'one', 'first', 'still', 'one', 'only', 'level-headed', 'looks', 'suicide', 'American', 'literature', 'first', 'bit', 'way', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'opening', 'credits', 'none', 'play', 'get', 'down', 'brass', 'tacks', 'Ms.', 'Norman', 'contest', 'wills', 'woman', 'who', 'tired', 'life', 'mother', 'who', 'too', 'scared', 'be', 'tired', 'life', 'fantastic', 'Spacek', 'Bancroft', 'play', 'roles', 'hilt', 'dialogue', ""n't"", 'quite', 'intense', 'film', 'play', 'cameras', 'being', 'what', 'are', 'characters', 'are', 'allowed', 'move', 'house', 'where', 'play', 'place', 'almost', 'completely', 'two', 'rooms', 'still', 'extremely', 'well', 'then', 'end', 'play', 'David', 'Shire', 'magic', 'once', 'again', 'wrecking', 'film', 'effect', 'movie', 'also', 'one', 'line', 'managed', 'pass', 'over', 'play', 'Bancroft', 'last', 'speech', 'just', 'plain', 'bad', 'one', 'wonders', 'why', 'Norman', 'who', 'adapted', 'own', 'play', 'screen', 'allowed', 'remain', 'Fast', 'forward', 'first', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'where', 'Spacek', 'Bancroft', 'where', 'gun', 'play', 'stop', 'last', 'line', 'play', 'quot', 'Loretta', 'Let', 'speak', 'Dawson', 'honey.', 'quot', ""'ve"", 'got', 'decent', 'adaptation', 'excellent', 'play', '***']",N/A

I guess what touchs me most about this movie is all that happens in one's life before it's over. not the fact that she is going to kill herself. also alot of stuff having to do with self confidence. there were things in the movie about what sissy thought of herself and why she felt so alone in the world. as simple as getting fired from a job because the way she looked at people to one of her mom's friends saying her hands were too cold. to the failed mothering of her child gone wrong to failed marriage to husband cecil to losing her father. these things might all seem depressing but in one's life alot takes place. all these things have touched a cord and sissy decides to get off the bus. what you get is a touching story and a wonderful film about a mothers attempt to save her child that has decided to take her life. 2 wonderful timeless performances from both actress's.,5,I say No Mamma!,1115510400,"05 8, 2005",2005,1197,"['know', 'alot', 'movies', 'even', 'ever', 'see', 'was', 'one', 'movies', 'took', 'forever', 'see', 'when', 'got', 'around', 'was', 'simply', 'blown', 'away', 'sissy', 'woman', 'who', 'kill', 'ends', 'simply', 'going', 'do', 'telling', 'mother', 'final', 'act', 'guess', 'what', 'touchs', 'most', 'movie', 'one', 'life', 'over', 'not', 'fact', 'going', 'kill', 'also', 'alot', 'stuff', 'having', 'do', 'self', 'confidence', 'were', 'things', 'movie', 'what', 'sissy', 'thought', 'herself', 'why', 'felt', 'so', 'alone', 'world', 'as', 'simple', 'getting', 'fired', 'job', 'way', 'looked', 'people', 'one', 'mom', 'friends', 'saying', 'hands', 'were', 'too', 'cold', 'failed', 'mothering', 'child', 'gone', 'wrong', 'failed', 'marriage', 'husband', 'cecil', 'losing', 'father', 'things', 'might', 'seem', 'depressing', 'one', 'life', 'alot', 'place', 'things', 'have', 'touched', 'cord', 'sissy', 'decides', 'get', 'off', 'bus', 'what', 'get', 'touching', 'story', 'wonderful', 'film', 'mothers', 'attempt', 'save', 'child', 'decided', 'take', 'life', '2', 'wonderful', 'timeless', 'performances', 'actress']",N/A
