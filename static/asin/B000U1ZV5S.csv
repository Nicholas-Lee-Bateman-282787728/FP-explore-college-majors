Esp like the grandpa, not perfect, but like a real flawed person. Great-sometimes we have to take parents as they are and not expect to much.

Shiloh was very sad and there are parts in the movie that show him being abused by an unhappy adult.  We stopped watching the movie because of this. It turned my stomach to see a dog being treated like this.  I haven't watched Duma or the Amazing Panda.  Our neighbors borrowed this movie set and their 8 year old liked all the movies.",3,Flipper is a classic,1356739200,"12 29, 2012",2012,447,"['thought', 'Flipper', 'was', 'good', 'family', 'movie', 'am', 'partial', 'dolphins', 'Good', 'price', '4', 'movies', 'one', 'set', 'Shiloh', 'was', 'very', 'sad', 'are', 'parts', 'movie', 'show', 'being', 'abused', 'unhappy', 'adult', 'stopped', 'watching', 'movie', 'turned', 'stomach', 'see', 'dog', 'being', 'treated', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'Duma', 'Amazing', 'Panda', 'neighbors', 'borrowed', 'movie', 'set', '8', 'year', 'old', 'liked', 'movies']",4 Film Favorites: Family Adventures (The Amazing Panda Adventure / Duma / Flipper / Shiloh)

1093285,A1TGDX7DY810TE,B000U1ZV5S,Karen,"[5, 5]",This is totally worth it. These are all good movies and at first I bought it for Shiloh only but once I watched the others I decided that I liked Flipper>Duma>Shiloh>The Panda Adventure. Flipper is kind of oldie movie and I love the interaction of the Dolphin with the boy. Duma is alot better than it looks--Its a complete and whole adventure and you won't be disappointed. Shiloh is still a good movie I just prefer the other ones over it. Then the Panda Adventure is fun to watch but I didn't like it as much because the Panda was fake at times and it didn't play a big role as I expected. The Panda was sort of a prop and a medium for the movie. I guess the only downside to this is a matter of selling the movie you don't like because the other side of a disc has a different movie. But that won't be a problem because all the movies are great.,5,awesome- 4 movies in one 2 disc,1281312000,"08 9, 2010",2010,849,"['totally', 'worth', 'are', 'good', 'movies', 'first', 'bought', 'Shiloh', 'only', 'once', 'watched', 'others', 'decided', 'liked', 'Flipper', '>', 'Duma', '>', 'Shiloh', '>', 'Panda', 'Adventure', 'Flipper', 'kind', 'oldie', 'movie', 'love', 'interaction', 'Dolphin', 'boy', 'Duma', 'alot', 'better', 'complete', 'whole', 'adventure', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'Shiloh', 'still', 'good', 'movie', 'just', 'prefer', 'other', 'ones', 'Then', 'Panda', 'Adventure', 'fun', 'watch', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'as', 'much', 'Panda', 'was', 'fake', 'times', 'did', ""n't"", 'play', 'big', 'role', 'expected', 'Panda', 'was', 'sort', 'prop', 'medium', 'movie', 'guess', 'only', 'downside', 'matter', 'selling', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'other', 'side', 'disc', 'different', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'problem', 'movies', 'are', 'great']",4 Film Favorites: Family Adventures (The Amazing Panda Adventure / Duma / Flipper / Shiloh)
