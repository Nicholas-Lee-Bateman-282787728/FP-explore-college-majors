1080442,A2TLCFD8RE12Z1,B000R7NBMK,"AGD ""Jonas Mac""","[3, 3]","I have to rate this documentary right up there with the very best ever made on the subject of WWII, up there with The World At War, a documentary that most WWII buffs consider the best made on the subject. This Documentary by Ken Burns & Co is a very different approach to this subject, very personal, heart-warming, gentle almost, and yes, heartbreaking, the people, the places, the battles at home and abroad, the stunning collection of breathtaking photographs, the mothers wringing their hands waiting at home to hear word of their boys, and all those brave young men and women, all of it strung together as only a loving artist concerned with the truth could create. Do yourself a favour and buy this as soon as possible, even if you think WWII documentaries are not for you, you will be greatly surprised and rewarded. This is something the whole family could sit and watch together and should be used as a history lesson in schools around the globe. It has to be one of the most lovingly put together Documenataries I have ever watched on any subject and I was in awe of many people here and was moved to tears on many occasions. To the makers: Well done, what a lovingly, tender job you have done. Deserved an Oscar hands down! Buy it! Buy it today!

1080443,AORXL977W3KI7,B000R7NBMK,Aging  Boomer,"[198, 309]","No Ken Burns film about war can escape comparison with his celebrated earlier film on ""The Civil War"". That was a masterpiece. This is a . . . non-masterpiece. Why is this so?First and foremost, I think, for a reason over which Burns has no control. The nineteenth-century Americans who experienced the Civil War were living in a still-literate age. They wrote intelligent, moving, verbally compelling accounts of their thoughts and feelings in their letters and diaries. Despite the visual nature of film, it was these written words, movingly read by various actors, that, as much as the images shown, gave ""The Civil War"" its exceptional emotional force. The personal narratives in ""The War"" are told, for the most part, by the participants themselves, in the flat, small-words-simple-sentences speech that has become the only way we know to speak and write in the 21st century. What happened to those who lived through World War II is just as moving as what happened to their forbears; their telling of the tale is not.Second, World War II is still too recent an event not to have implications for today's politics, and thus to trigger our political biases. Burns, an obvious liberal, does not avoid this hazard. In this film, only Germany invades Poland; the simultaneous Russian invasion is unmentioned. The Soviet Union's willing, eager collaboration with the Nazis, up to the moment that Hitler finally stabbed Stalin in the back, is ignored. As to America, far too much time is spent on our domestic racial problems and how they bore on the war, including, for the umpteenth time, more soul-searching on the decision to intern Japanese Americans, a decision which at the time was defensible, and in any case inevitable. History into which we project our contemporary values isn't history; it's political argument.Third, and most fundamentally, it is not possible to tell a compelling story of World War II while confined to the post-Pearl Harbor American experience. That is why Herman Wouk's magnificent novel of the war, though primarily the story of an American family's wartime experiences, spends roughly half its prose on events prior to Pearl Harbor (""The Winds of War"") and only half on events thereafter (""War and Remembrance""). Without the background, the foreground is distorted, and deprived of meaning.The best film history of World War II remains the independent British series ""The World at War"", no longer ubiquitous on television as it once was, but still available on DVD. There is also a good BBC film history.",2,A disappointment,1190592000,"09 24, 2007",2007,2537,"['Ken', 'Burns', 'film', 'war', 'can', 'escape', 'comparison', 'celebrated', 'earlier', 'film', 'Civil', 'War', 'was', 'masterpiece', 'non-masterpiece', 'Why', 'so', 'First', 'foremost', 'think', 'reason', 'Burns', 'control', 'nineteenth-century', 'Americans', 'who', 'experienced', 'Civil', 'War', 'were', 'living', 'still-literate', 'age', 'wrote', 'intelligent', 'moving', 'verbally', 'compelling', 'accounts', 'thoughts', 'feelings', 'letters', 'diaries', 'visual', 'nature', 'film', 'was', 'written', 'words', 'movingly', 'read', 'various', 'actors', 'that', 'as', 'much', 'images', 'shown', 'gave', 'Civil', 'War', 'exceptional', 'emotional', 'force', 'personal', 'narratives', 'War', 'are', 'told', 'most', 'part', 'participants', 'flat', 'small-words-simple-sentences', 'speech', 'become', 'only', 'way', 'know', 'speak', 'write', '21st', 'century', 'What', 'happened', 'who', 'lived', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'just', 'as', 'moving', 'what', 'happened', 'forbears', 'telling', 'tale', 'not.Second', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'still', 'too', 'recent', 'event', 'not', 'have', 'implications', 'today', 'politics', 'thus', 'trigger', 'political', 'biases', 'Burns', 'obvious', 'liberal', 'not', 'avoid', 'hazard', 'film', 'only', 'Germany', 'invades', 'Poland', 'simultaneous', 'Russian', 'invasion', 'unmentioned', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'willing', 'eager', 'collaboration', 'Nazis', 'up', 'moment', 'Hitler', 'finally', 'stabbed', 'Stalin', 'back', 'ignored', 'America', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'spent', 'domestic', 'racial', 'problems', 'how', 'bore', 'war', 'including', 'umpteenth', 'time', 'more', 'soul-searching', 'decision', 'intern', 'Japanese', 'Americans', 'decision', 'time', 'was', 'defensible', 'case', 'inevitable', 'History', 'project', 'contemporary', 'values', ""n't"", 'history', 'political', 'argument.Third', 'most', 'fundamentally', 'not', 'possible', 'tell', 'compelling', 'story', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'confined', 'post-Pearl', 'Harbor', 'American', 'experience', 'why', 'Herman', 'Wouk', 'magnificent', 'novel', 'war', 'primarily', 'story', 'American', 'family', 'wartime', 'experiences', 'roughly', 'prose', 'events', 'prior', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'Winds', 'War', 'only', 'half', 'events', 'thereafter', 'War', 'Remembrance', 'background', 'foreground', 'distorted', 'deprived', 'meaning.The', 'best', 'film', 'history', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'independent', 'British', 'series', 'World', 'War', 'no', 'longer', 'ubiquitous', 'television', 'once', 'was', 'still', 'available', 'DVD', 'also', 'good', 'BBC', 'film', 'history']",N/A

Movies like Saving Private Ryan & Shindler's List helped somewhat in bringing reality closer to a younger generation but in the end you still knew it was Hollywood (though at its very best).It wasn't until I watched Ken Burn's The War that WWII seemed real and tangible. Some critics state Ken Burns made a mistake by hardly mentioning FDR, Churchill, and other famous figures of era. I think this is Ken Burn's best characteristic. I can see documentaries of the politicians of the Era anytime of the day on cable - there is a plethora of those around. Here Ken Burns bring in veterans and family members discussing their own personal stories bringing alive history in a personal way.There is some mention of a liberal anti-war slant to the movie. Yes, it is there but it is very subtle and honestly  I doubt anyone is going change their viewpoint of war after watching this. None of the people interviewed were anti-war, actually some interviewers said they were zealously for fighting the war w/one dvd in the series entitled A Necessary War.I was literally brought to tears from the stories told by pilots Quentin Aanenson and Earl Burke, who somehow beat the odds on the bomber planes, a most dangerous job were most only lasted an average of 14 flights & an average of 600 men were lost on each mission (think Memphis Belle but with the real life people retelling). The infantrymen interviewed also told of their Omaha Beach landing.The footage is breathtaking because it is not all grainy black and white but colored home videos and news footage underlining the point these are people just like us. Tom Hanks, Bobby Cannavale, and Adam Arkin are among the narrators who are perfectly cast.The War is an emotional rollercoaster where you feel pride at the United States and their industrial workers, anger at the incompetent policy, horror of the staggering deaths, and awe of men who rushed onto the beaches of France knowing full well they would probably die.

1080445,A1IQVBGOYVEFBI,B000R7NBMK,Allan Brain,"[16, 21]","My 88 year old mother lost her only sibling, a wonderful guy by all accounts, when he was killed in January 1945 in the aftermath of the ""Battle of the Bulge"".  She and I compared notes every night aswe watched this series on PBS.  There were many tearful exchanges, as I had grown up looking at her photo of her brother, with another soldier, two handsome young kids in their army uniforms, full of confidence.Much of the power of this series is that there were obviously so many battles, including some of the major ones in both the Pacific and European ""theaters"", that were totally unnecessary.  It's haunting to me even to think about those.  Yet it's impossible to compare that kind of consideration with what we can clearly see about the war we are currently engaged in--a war that was not only totally unnecessary, but has made things worse for us.It's not a sentiment that is new to me--I was a conscientious objector when I was drafted to Vietnam in 1970--but I was struck by several of the moving statements of the veterans of this war.  Eugene Sledge, after the totally futile and useless siege of Peleiu: ""...possibly I lost faith that politicians in high places wh do not have to endure war's savagery will ever stop blundering and sending others to endure it..""Don't believe the critics who have been lukewarm on this series.  It will move you, make you question your government, and most importantly, connect you with those who suffered through these times and make you proud of them and of times when we truly had ""leadership"" from a great American, Franklin Delano Roosevelt.Remember what he said about fear?  The triumph of this film is thatyou truly feel that, even as you realize that it was a tough fight.Just a couple of thoughts on how the film could have been better:1. There should have been some explanation of how there was some dissent in Germany, even an attempt to assassinate Hitler when things started going badly.2. As I recall, when the Allied troops encountered the horrors of the death camps, there was some discussion of whether those horrors should have been captured on film.  I believe it was Eisenhower who insisted that films be made because otherwise some people would try to claim later that these things did not happen, or did not happen on the scale that they did.3. Again, in connection with the death camps, Burns hints somewhat subtly at what I suspect he feels, namely that the German and Austrian people knew what was going on in the camps.  This is an important and hotly debated point, but the history of other genocidal regimes suggests that in fact, the ""final solution"" was hardly a secret.  Burns has one of the vets recount how the smell of one camp--one of the less notorious ones inAustria, not Auschwitz or Dachau--was present in the adjacent town.",5,How it happened--and why does it happen again?,1191283200,"10 2, 2007",2007,2810,"['88', 'year', 'old', 'mother', 'lost', 'only', 'sibling', 'wonderful', 'guy', 'accounts', 'when', 'was', 'killed', 'January', '1945', 'aftermath', 'Battle', 'Bulge', 'compared', 'notes', 'night', 'aswe', 'watched', 'series', 'PBS', 'were', 'many', 'tearful', 'exchanges', 'had', 'grown', 'up', 'looking', 'photo', 'brother', 'soldier', 'two', 'handsome', 'young', 'kids', 'army', 'uniforms', 'full', 'confidence.Much', 'power', 'series', 'were', 'obviously', 'so', 'many', 'battles', 'including', 'major', 'ones', 'Pacific', 'European', 'theaters', 'were', 'totally', 'unnecessary', 'haunting', 'even', 'think', 'impossible', 'compare', 'kind', 'consideration', 'what', 'can', 'clearly', 'see', 'war', 'are', 'currently', 'engaged', 'war', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'totally', 'unnecessary', 'made', 'things', 'worse', 'us.It', 'not', 'sentiment', 'new', 'was', 'conscientious', 'objector', 'when', 'was', 'drafted', 'Vietnam', '1970', 'was', 'struck', 'several', 'moving', 'statements', 'veterans', 'war', 'Eugene', 'Sledge', 'totally', 'futile', 'useless', 'siege', 'Peleiu', 'possibly', 'lost', 'faith', 'politicians', 'high', 'places', 'wh', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'endure', 'war', 'savagery', 'will', 'ever', 'stop', 'blundering', 'sending', 'others', 'endure', 'it..', 'Do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'critics', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'lukewarm', 'series', 'will', 'move', 'make', 'question', 'government', 'most', 'importantly', 'connect', 'who', 'suffered', 'times', 'make', 'proud', 'times', 'when', 'truly', 'had', 'leadership', 'great', 'American', 'Franklin', 'Delano', 'Roosevelt.Remember', 'what', 'said', 'fear', 'triumph', 'film', 'thatyou', 'truly', 'feel', 'even', 'realize', 'was', 'tough', 'fight.Just', 'couple', 'thoughts', 'how', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better:1', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'explanation', 'how', 'was', 'dissent', 'Germany', 'even', 'attempt', 'assassinate', 'Hitler', 'when', 'things', 'started', 'going', 'badly.2', 'recall', 'when', 'Allied', 'troops', 'encountered', 'horrors', 'death', 'camps', 'was', 'discussion', 'horrors', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'captured', 'film', 'believe', 'was', 'Eisenhower', 'who', 'insisted', 'films', 'be', 'made', 'otherwise', 'people', 'would', 'try', 'claim', 'later', 'things', 'did', 'not', 'happen', 'did', 'not', 'happen', 'scale', 'did.3', 'Again', 'connection', 'death', 'camps', 'Burns', 'somewhat', 'subtly', 'what', 'suspect', 'namely', 'German', 'Austrian', 'people', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'camps', 'important', 'hotly', 'debated', 'point', 'history', 'other', 'genocidal', 'regimes', 'fact', 'final', 'solution', 'was', 'hardly', 'secret', 'Burns', 'one', 'vets', 'recount', 'how', 'smell', 'one', 'camp', 'one', 'less', 'notorious', 'ones', 'inAustria', 'not', 'Auschwitz', 'Dachau', 'was', 'present', 'adjacent', 'town']",N/A

Burns isn't telling those stories, and the omissions are on purpose.  This film looks at the war from a different angle, adding a new layer of social history to the big stories that have already been told.

It is simpleminded and should only be watched if you are not an intellectual or have the brain capacity of a coma patient. It was funded by PBS, which is subsidized and owned by giant American corporations, so the content is entirely prejudiced.It puts all the blame on Germany. In fact, it entirely avoids the scheming that England and the US concocted during 1912 - 1940's regarding industrial supremacy. England and the US were afraid of a united Europe under Germany so their industrial leaders cooperated in creating another war against Germany. Propaganda was churned out in America and England. Pearl Harbor was staged as a fake starting excuse for war, as to get involved with resource rich areas in the Pacific that Japan wanted. Germany was bombed day and night by American bombers. Historic old cities were destroyed, not to mention all the civilians the American bombers burned to a crisp. So if you think America had no world ambition, you are mistaken. Examine the vicious America world order after the war.The result of the Second World War was that the US and England controlled banks, industry and trade in the world, not to mention leaving 40 million dead in Europe, which effectively sapped and extinguished its workforce.

It is simpleminded and should only be watched if you are not an intellectual or have the brain capacity of a coma patient. It was funded by PBS, which is subsidized and owned by giant American corporations, so the content is entirely prejudiced.It puts all the blame on Germany. In fact, it entirely avoids the scheming that England and the US concocted during 1912 - 1940's regarding industrial supremacy. England and the US were afraid of a united Europe under Germany so their industrial leaders cooperated in creating another war against Germany. Propaganda was churned out in America and England. Pearl Harbor was staged as a fake starting excuse for war, as to get involved with resource rich areas in the Pacific that Japan wanted. Germany was bombed day and night by American bombers. Historic old cities were destroyed, not to mention all the civilians the American bombers burned to a crisp. So if you think America had no world ambition, you are mistaken.  Examine the vicious America world order after the war.The result of the Second World War was that the US and England controlled banks, industry and trade in the world, not to mention leaving 40 million dead in Europe, which effectively sapped and extinguished its workforce.

1080454,A2POYXTGSPSW7O,B000R7NBMK,Bill Hensler,"[15, 19]","This is a fair series and a good introduction to WWII for a high school class.  For any real or part time historian it's fair.  This reviewer has come to expect major bias in any PBS series and the fairly even treatment the USA receives from Ken Burns is a nice break from the relentless media ""this nation is evil"" coverage.Burns does a good job of showing the USA's build up to the war.  He does leave out the fact that the US Navy was the equal of the British Navy.  But Burns does show the fact that the US Army was ill prepaired for WWII.  Also, Burns shows the first major battle of the US Army at Kasserine Pass in early 1943.  The Germans wrecked the better part of a corps of the US Army and knocked it back over 50 miles.  While the Soviets had beat Germany at Moscow and Stalingrad in 1941 and 1942 the US Army didn't even get in its first fight with Germany until 1943.  That should be a shock to the viewers.Now, the series is given as sort of a martix to viewers.  Every disk covers a set period of time:  1941, 1942, 1943, and ect.  Then there are chapters in every time frame.  A viewer will see the home front, racial problems, the internment of Japanese Americans, the dreadful prison conditions Japan put both our citizens and soldiers to endure, the fighting by the army, and the actions by the US Navy.  What drove this reviewer nuts was the conditions in the Japanese and German death camps was put side by side next to the conditions of the Japanese American camps.  Yes, it's too bad that the Japanese Americans were jailed.  However, to show it as equal as the German or Japanese death camps is bias on a plate.Burns ignores lots of action by the US Navy.  He ignores Java Sea, Savo Island, Coral Sea, and Bismarck Sea.  He spends lots of time on Midway.  But if two Japanese carriers had not had their aircrews destroyed at Coral Sea then the US would have been looking at six carriers at Midway, not just four.  Bismarck Sea wrecks the last offensive action of the Japanese Navy.Burns also kind of ignores the U-boat war.  So, between giving a light treatment of Naval actions in the Pacific and basically ignoring the U-boat war it costs a star.Burns spends a lot of time with racial and riots in the USA.  While the Soviet Union was wrecking the Nazi Wehrmacht at Moscow, Stalingrad, and Kursk there were race riots in Georgia and Detroit.  Burns shows the war through four cities in four seperate states.  Honestly, it may not be a good representation.  Alabama is in the deep South but Mobile Bay is not representative of the area.  California's City of Sacramento may not be a typical California city.  You get an impression of a weird sort of view that isn't quite like all of America.Burns does not properly show that this war was America's production war.  America made over 10 battleships (400,000 tons), 200 destroyers (400,000 tons), thousands of heavy bombers, tens of thousands of fighters, over 35,000 Sherman tanks, over 1 million heavy machine guns, and the rest of the materials needed for war.Now, in the much better video series on WWII is ""World at War"", produced by the BBC in the early 1970s.  It does a much better job of showing the allies in the fight and - weirdly - does a better job of showing the USA getting ready, fighting, and producing for the war.The World at War (30th Anniversary Edition)Another annoying thing is the reading of letters by various actors, such as the over rated Tom Hanks.  It detracts from the message and the time would have been better showing the weapons systems or the internal problems of the US Army.Burns does spend a lot of time on the subject of the Strategic bomber offensive against Germany.  Now, it is something worth noting that the United States Army Air Force lost more airmen in 1943 fighting against Germany than the US Army lost in soldiers at the debacle at Tunisia Pass.  The video series ""World at War"" tells the view by doing interviews with the Germans that Nazi Germany had to expend an Army of soldiers and airmen to protect the Reich against air attacks.  Burns does not get that point across to his view; the allies in 1943 had a defacto second front against the Germans which is exactly what Stalin wanted.But the part where Ken Burns makes up for all of the sins was in the fall of Japan.  I expected bias to be served in large amounts.  Instead it was quite good.  The B-29 bombing of Japan was shown as it was intended; it's a way of beating Japan.  The atomic bombs are just a weapon system that induce Japan to surrender.  Burns shows what the people of that era in the USA showed of the atomic bombing of Japan; they loved it.  It ended the war.  It stopped the killing of Americans.  It is weird but the Nuclear attacks stops the war cold and allows the Allied soldiers and civilian prisioners to be given food and rescued from their brutal captors.  I've never understood people who have empathy for Japan's citizens and ignore the sufferring of their own countrymen dying in prison camps.  Burns did a good job of showing this from an Allied point of view.So, I would endorse this video for a quick and fast way of learning about a war that determines America's destiny in the last sixty years of the 20th Century.  The viewer is given an over view of race relations, the fighting, the results, and conditions at home.It's not bad and earns an honest three stars.",3,Fairly good for PBS,1218499200,"08 12,

(Beautiful sequence in episode 3 of an outdoor wedding reception)  Viewers will become acquainted with the various experiences of war veterans; not all of them male, and not all of them adult at the time by any means, as the reminiscences of a woman interned as a child with her family at Santo Tomas in the Philippines will attest.You will be left with the impressions of the war in various theaters and in various years by the Americans who experienced it; interesting and moving to be sure, but a somewhat limited view. I felt the lack of some sober historian stepping in occasionally, and making strategic sense out of it all; it was all who, where and what, but disappointingly little ""why"".The six disc set is tastefully boxed, and includes a long  feature on production of the series - always interesting, how these things are assembled, a commentary from Ken Burns on Disc 3, and a massive and generous collection of deleted scenes and interviews, as well as biographies - from which last, I fled screaming.

He was attending Tuskegee Institute when he joined the Army.  He wanted to train with the Tuskegee Airmen, but his father would not allow it. Being black, he was segregated from the white troops, but I believe his horrors were the same.  He would not talk too much about them to my mother or my brother and me, but the two things I do remember him telling me about were his befriending a little English boy.  He gave him some of his rashions as well as a fishing pole. It warmed my heart to hear him tell me stories about the times he shared with that little boy.  He also told me he never knew hunger like he did in the Pacific.  He would eat bark off the trees just to stave off the pangs.

The brushstroke, wordly coinage, motion of the camera, or whatever it is that constitutes the given art, becomes more than the brushstroke, wordly coinage, or motion of the camera. There seems to be an almost ineffable rise in the ability to invoke reaction from the art's percipients, and while certainly not supernatural, the great art and the great artist is a cut above, even if the mechanism of the ascendancy is not immediately evident, even to the most astute critic.This ideal was brought home to me while watching filmmaker Ken Burns' most recent PBS documentary, The War, co-directed by Lynn Novick, for Burns, despite his ability to often stumble into a great moment, seems not to fundamentally understand the mechanics nor elements that constitute greatness. This 15 plus hour film follows in the wake of three other monumental documentaries he has crafted in the last decade and a half: the magnificent The Civil War- whose only dramatic flaw was the melodramatic schmaltz historian Shelby Foote displayed for the Confederacy, the too long Baseball, and the somnolent Jazz. In between he has crafted some interesting shorter documentaries on subjects as diverse as Mark Twain and Jack Johnson, but his bread and butter has been the marquee `big doc.'Burns has been plagued by years of controversies, both artistically and historically. His best film, The Civil War, which pioneered the Burnsian template of talking heads, melodramatic readings of personal letters, and slow scans of still photographs, accompanied by sometimes highly poetic words (and often purple prose), and swelling crescendos of music, was a triumph of art in a journalistic form. Yet, even that artistically great film was dogged by numerous historical flaws- documented in Robert Brent Toplin's book Ken Burn's The Civil War: Historians Respond. Baseball was far too long, and too obsessed with the cult of personality, rather than the thing that made the game America's pastime: its history, season by season, and its pennant races. Jazz was a snooze that hagiographized often obscure musicians, and the whole project was a bit too weighted down with Political Correctness.Burns does not often fall into The Greatest Generation claptrap that was so nauseating a decade ago- after all, yes, that generation defeated the Nazis and Japanese empires, but did nothing to end segregation and interned 120,000 Japanese-American citizens. By contrast, the Baby Boomers presided over the downfall of the Soviet Empire, sent man to the moon, ended the folly of Vietnam, supported Civil Rights and Women's Liberation, founded the modern Conservation movement, and survived the political hari-kiri of Watergate and Iran-Contra. By my scorecard, the Baby Boomers win by a substantial margin.Yet, given all the potential that Burns demonstrated with his magisterial, if flawed, The Civil War, those many years ago, The War comes off as a passable, though ultimately forgettable, document- a solid 70 out of 100; but far short of the BBC's mid-1970s landmark (albeit Anglophilic) The World At War, still the touchstone documentary effort regarding World War Two. The reasons for these I have documented. So, I must return to my earlier posit, that this solid effort is not only different in scale from The Civil War, but different in kind. One may be able to pinpoint a scene here, or a dozen there, see the flaw stemming from Burns' own parting of ways with his brother Ric Burns, who was instrumental in many of Ken Burns' earlier, better works, or some other reason I have not spotted, or have forgotten in the morass of this film's heft- even though it seems far less weighty than the shorter great film. Yet, whatever that reason is, or those reasons are, to most they will remain as ineffable as the insights so many of Burns' subjects could not voice. And, after all, is not the voice the key to all good stories?Lo!",3,Solid,1221955200,"09 21, 2008",2008,4096,"['regards', 'art', 'greatness', 'not', 'merely', 'difference', 'scale', 'difference', 'kind', 'elements', 'constitute', 'greatness', 'force', 'almost', 'alchemical', 'change', 'nature', 'beast', 'brushstroke', 'wordly', 'coinage', 'motion', 'camera', 'whatever', 'given', 'art', 'more', 'brushstroke', 'wordly', 'coinage', 'motion', 'camera', 'be', 'almost', 'ineffable', 'rise', 'ability', 'invoke', 'reaction', 'art', 'percipients', 'certainly', 'not', 'supernatural', 'great', 'art', 'great', 'artist', 'cut', 'even', 'mechanism', 'ascendancy', 'not', 'immediately', 'evident', 'even', 'most', 'astute', 'critic.This', 'ideal', 'was', 'brought', 'home', 'watching', 'filmmaker', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'most', 'recent', 'PBS', 'documentary', 'War', 'co-directed', 'Lynn', 'Novick', 'Burns', 'ability', 'often', 'stumble', 'great', 'moment', 'not', 'fundamentally', 'understand', 'mechanics', 'elements', 'constitute', 'greatness', '15', 'hour', 'film', 'wake', 'three', 'other', 'monumental', 'documentaries', 'crafted', 'last', 'decade', 'half', 'magnificent', 'Civil', 'War-', 'only', 'dramatic', 'flaw', 'was', 'melodramatic', 'schmaltz', 'historian', 'Shelby', 'Foote', 'displayed', 'Confederacy', 'too', 'long', 'Baseball', 'somnolent', 'Jazz', 'crafted', 'interesting', 'shorter', 'documentaries', 'subjects', 'as', 'diverse', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'Jack', 'Johnson', 'bread', 'butter', 'been', 'marquee', 'big', 'doc', 'been', 'plagued', 'years', 'controversies', 'artistically', 'historically', 'best', 'film', 'Civil', 'War', 'pioneered', 'Burnsian', 'template', 'talking', 'heads', 'melodramatic', 'readings', 'personal', 'letters', 'slow', 'scans', 'still', 'photographs', 'accompanied', 'sometimes', 'highly', 'poetic', 'words', 'often', 'purple', 'prose', 'swelling', 'crescendos', 'music', 'was', 'triumph', 'art', 'journalistic', 'form', 'even', 'artistically', 'great', 'film', 'was', 'dogged', 'numerous', 'historical', 'flaws-', 'documented', 'Robert', 'Brent', 'Toplin', 'book', 'Ken', 'Burn', 'Civil', 'War', 'Historians', 'Respond', 'Baseball', 'was', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'too', 'obsessed', 'cult', 'personality', 'rather', 'thing', 'made', 'game', 'America', 'pastime', 'history', 'season', 'season', 'pennant', 'races', 'Jazz', 'was', 'snooze', 'hagiographized', 'often', 'obscure', 'musicians', 'whole', 'project', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'weighted', 'down', 'Political', 'Correctness.Burns', 'not', 'often', 'fall', 'Greatest', 'Generation', 'claptrap', 'was', 'so', 'nauseating', 'decade', 'ago-', 'yes', 'generation', 'defeated', 'Nazis', 'Japanese', 'empires', 'did', 'nothing', 'end', 'segregation', 'interned', '120,000', 'Japanese-American', 'citizens', 'contrast', 'Baby', 'Boomers', 'presided', 'downfall', 'Soviet', 'Empire', 'sent', 'man', 'moon', 'ended', 'folly', 'Vietnam', 'supported', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'Women', 'Liberation', 'founded', 'modern', 'Conservation', 'movement', 'survived', 'political', 'hari-kiri', 'Watergate', 'Iran-Contra', 'scorecard', 'Baby', 'Boomers', 'win', 'substantial', 'margin.Yet', 'given', 'potential', 'Burns', 'demonstrated', 'magisterial', 'flawed', 'Civil', 'War', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'War', 'off', 'passable', 'ultimately', 'forgettable', 'document-', 'solid', '70', '100', 'far', 'short', 'BBC', 'mid-1970s', 'landmark', 'Anglophilic', 'World', 'War', 'still', 'touchstone', 'documentary', 'effort', 'regarding', 'World', 'War', 'Two', 'reasons', 'have', 'documented', 'So', 'must', 'return', 'earlier', 'posit', 'solid', 'effort', 'not', 'only', 'different', 'scale', 'Civil', 'War', 'different', 'kind', 'One', 'may', 'be', 'able', 'pinpoint', 'scene', 'here', 'dozen', 'there', 'see', 'flaw', 'stemming', 'Burns', 'own', 'parting', 'ways', 'brother', 'Ric', 'Burns', 'who', 'was', 'instrumental', 'many', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'earlier', 'better', 'works', 'other', 'reason', 'have', 'not', 'spotted', 'have', 'forgotten', 'morass', 'film', 'heft-', 'even', 'far', 'less', 'weighty', 'shorter', 'great', 'film', 'reason', 'reasons', 'are', 'most', 'will', 'remain', 'as', 'ineffable', 'insights', 'so', 'many', 'Burns', 'subjects', 'could', 'not', 'voice', 'not', 'voice', 'key', 'good', 'stories', 'Lo']",N/A

Here Burns delivers a knockout with his latest documentary simply called the War. It deserves no other title or moniker and to generations that have been born since the greatest generation led us to victory it can only be known as just that. Being an admirer of his past works, Jazz, Baseball and the Civil War I knew immediately I would be in for a treat. Burns examines and shares the stories of four distinctly different American towns spread across this country and illustrates with impeccable detail through recollections of those who lived in these times as well as polished home made video (of that time) the way in which the War had a profound effect on the people of these towns. I will say that the scenes shown in this series are at times gruesome and very much for adult eyes but this only adds to the candidness and accuracy in the retelling of this Apocalyptic war. One thing I was impressed by was the way in which Burns takes ordinary people and magnifies the importance they held in keeping this country alive throughout our 4 year involvement in WW2. If one thing can be said as an afterthought from having seen the series I can say I am proud of the way Americans (White, African-American, Asian and Spanish) each considered themselves American before anything else and did all they could to support the single cause of defeating an evil entity in the form of Nazi Germany and her axis.

He would never be drafted), the war was a few months from being over.  He headed over on a troop ship in June 1945 and, before he could see any action, the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were dropped.  A short layover in the Philippines and he was going back to Los Angeles.As far as I can figure, he was going to be a part of an invasion team to invade Kyushu province sometime in October or November of 1945.  If that had happened, he, and a lot of our allies, would have faced a religious army that would have dragged the conflict out for months, or even years.  It would be unlikely, under those circumstances that my dad would have survived.I consider him a veteran because he was willing to go.  The fact that he didn't see combat is irrelevant.  He was a hero, just like millions fighting on our side during that, with great hope, the last of the great conflicts on Earth.

For example, the Japanese internment.  It was discussed in 3 separate scenes in Episodes 1-3 on the first 2 DVDs.  So, you hear part of the story on one DVD, and then they add more information to the same story on subsequent DVDs.  This makes it a bit disjointed.  At first, it gave me the impression that they were only touching lightly on various topics, and that was disappointing...only later to find another scene that dealt with the same topic...sometimes with the same footage...and re-introducing the topic all over again (as if they had not covered it previously)...and that was annoying.I would have liked more diagrams depicting troop/fleet movements and strategy.The focus is mainly American.  That's okay; but as the series pointed-out, Americans suffered the fewest losses, and America's direct involvement in the war didn't come until later.

1080492,A2230OS9W655QF,B000R7NBMK,Grant Waara,"[3, 4]","""The War,"" was already the subject of much controversy before it was even released. Had it not had the name ""Ken Burns"" attached to it, I'm certain it wouldn't have been the subject of such withering scrutiny.For me, the controversy is the biggest load of rubbish. Nowhere did Mr. Burns or Ms. Novick say that their series was ""definitive,"" or even a complete story of World War II. People have complained that not all ethnic groups were represented. Well, you can only cover so much territory and sorry, some people are going to be overlooked. That's television for you. It happens. Others have complained that the first two years weren't mentioned (it was but mainly in passing), but they're missing the point. This series is about the AMERICAN perspective. Not a global one. That's why there's no other Allied viewpoints or the Axis perspective.You have to take this series for what it is, and that's a general overview of the Second World War as seen by those who experienced it from four American cities. Each city represented a different region: Waterbury Ct. (the East Coast); Luverne MN (the midwest), Sacramento CA (the West Coast) and lastly, Mobile AL (the South). It's about what the war did to the people of those towns and these towns are in a way, representative of America as a whole. It tells us in a general way, what World War II did to America. Yes, Native Americans and Hispanics were missed, but I don't think that it was intentional. When you write for film history, you have to make choices.On the whole, I think Florentine Films did a wonderful job.

Or in a less scolding tone, how do you know where you're going if you don't know where you've been?  While few would argue that The United States of America isn't rich with stories and adventures of personal achievement what with the so called winning of the West, the age of industrialization, and our rise to becomming a world superpower being an active part of our mythology.  Or is it?  Gore Vidal once refered to the citizens of this fair country as ""The United States of Amnesia,"" suggesting many Americans remember very little of their foreground and even less of their background.  Yet for anyone old enought to have experienced the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and our long hard struggle to bring World War Two to a peaceful resolution both in the Pacific and Europe, this three and one half year-plus event is most likely sealed in personal memory along with the other milestones of life such as marriages, births and deaths of loved ones.  One reason World War II, or as the producers have aptly named their 14 hour overview of this world changing experience, ""The War,"" had such an impact on our citizens is that everyone, and I do mean everyone, took an active part in bringing this world disaster to a successful conclusion.  But that was then and this is now and today, the military veterans or living historians of ""The War"" are dying as are many of the other participants - the wives, friends and relatives of our brave veterans and almost as important, their first hand recollections and memories of this world shapping event are dying as well.  Fortunately for all who worry of such things, we have a national historian among us with the ability to keep our history alive especially for those who don't even like history.  His name is Ken Burns and he is a film maker with the talents of a master story teller as evidenced by such interesting perspectives on American life as ""Baseball"" and ""Jazz"" and most especially ""The Civil War.""  Now or within a few days, we will have Ken Burns and Lynn Novick's living perspective of the Second World War or ""The War"" to appreciate and enjoy for as long as we care to know more about ourselves both as individuals and collectively as a nation of citizens.

That, and the fact that I am so empathetic that I became slightly sick during the week I was watching it, actually BECAUSE of the gruesome images and events of World War Two.Some of the statistics presented in Ken Burn's THE WAR surprised me.  Yes, the overwhelming number of deaths during WWII were civilians, not military personnel, I got that.  I did not know that during 1941 the United States manufactured more than 3 million cars; but that during the Entire Rest Of World War Two the United States only made 139 cars.  Our ENTIRE industrial production was re-purposed for War Production.  The former companies that had formerly churned out cars switched to half-tracks, tanks, planes.  At the Ford company, one plant had 67 acres of assembly under one roof, where 24-7 they built B24 Liberator Bombers.  One more every 63 minutes.World War III will probably be over within one week, with the major engagements over within the first day.  But in the multi-year-long WWII fight, industrial production decided the result.  Not relevant: ""How many ships and tanks you had NOW.""

Of course, one can talk about the limitations that an almost exclusively American perspective entails.  And other particulars.  But the work as a whole is symphonic, as moving, informative, and authentic as anything I know.So just this bit.  In the last episode there is a list of the liberated camps.  The first named is Treblinka.  But nobody liberated Treblinka - not the Soviets, the Americans, or the Brits.  Treblinka was shut down and levelled at the end of 1943 by the Germans themselves because there were no more people to kill there.In the overall section on the Holocaust there is also the suggestion that the genocide was a surprise.  No doubt it was to the GIs on the ground; and, yes, there is knowing and knowing.  But it would not have been irrelevant, in this documentary from the American perspective, to have noted that the U.S. government had known the scale of the genocide since 1942.  And it was reported widely in the U.S. press, although rarely on the front pages.  The suggestion of a kind of ""shocked innocence"" in 1945 that The War conveys could easily have been qualified.In a work so great, I was disturbed by this omission and by the definitve mistake about Treblinka.

Don't be mistaken. There is a huge amount of gripping film, including colour, of the battles fought.

So now, while I appreciate that we have not just one but several channels on cable that are almost entirely dedicated to historical material (which is just great), I find myself just slightly put off.  Allow me to explain.  When I watch a show on the History Channel, they have updated the events with new angles and information that has come to light over the years, I appreciate that.  However, they have also made attempts to add drama, for lack of a better word, to history.  The voice-overs are dramatic, the music is sometimes overbearing, and most damning (to me), they make things too repetitive!  The same lines by the narrator, reiterating what has already been said after returning from commerical, showing the same footage--which we've just seen!--again and again after commercial, as if we need to be reminded.

Pouliot,"[6, 6]","Ken Burns has done what few have done before him, which is to take in the broad story of the WWII period across gender, party and racial lines. He does this by focusing on four US towns -- Waterbury, CT, Mobile, AL, Luverne, MN and Sacramento, CA. Less well discussed is his repeated interviews with participants throughout the documentary. Daniel Inouye, for instance, touches on several aspects of the war. A Japanese American living in Hawaii, he helped wounded servicemen immediately after the attack on Pearl Harbor. His later service in the military brings to light a little-told story of the war -- Japanese Americas, some with relatives in resettlement camps in the western US, fighting for the country that mistreated their families. ""The War"" brings home the cost of the war to families. Airmen destined to take part in D-Day say loving goodbyes to their families, all but certain they will not return. Soldiers in the South Pacific a little too gleefully about shooting Japanese soldiers swimming for their lives out to sea.The footage of ""The War"" is extraordinary. There is a surprising amount of color (not colorized) footage. Burns's team painstakingly added authentic battle sounds to the otherwise silent footage, bringing it to horrifying life. Burns also makes great (but restrained) use of maps, showing Allied progress in the Pacific and European theaters of war. But it's the stateside footage that surprises. There is plenty of footage of America going to work to win the war, and plenty of stories of Americans at each others throats. Southern shipyards needed talented labor, but insisted that blacks and whites enter through separate entrances, even if it was only a fence that kept them apart. Women went to work at ""men's"" jobs, and did them ably, but history shows that they would have to fight again to regain these privilegesI have read criticisms that ""The War"" focuses too much on internecine conflict and too little on the shared sense of purpose that Americans felt when confronted with two militaristic empires. I disagree. Imperfect people are capable of incredible achievement. Our parents and grandparents do not have to be depicted as infallible gods to be seen as honorable. American generals need not win every battle to be heroes. MacArthur's inability to get his planes off the ground on December 7, 1941 -- in spite of a 9-hour warning -- may be jarring, but it is truth, and led to the horrific Bataan Death March, in spite of his later victories. Omaha Beach bravery is not diminished because the bombers sent in to soften up the German defense mostly missed their marks.Burns has done a signal job of depicting the war years in their complexity, horror and glory.

1080508,A3KY68OTSNHM3G,B000R7NBMK,Jeffrey T. Munson,"[2, 3]","Ken Burns has produced many documentaries on different subjects, including the Civil War, baseball, and jazz music.  But he does perhaps his best work with this compelling and revealing documentary about World War II.Focusing on the stories of citizens from Waterbury, CT; Sacramento, CA; Luverne, MN; and Mobile, AL, Burns covers all fronts of the war, from the attack on Pearl Harbor in December, 1941 through VJ day in August, 1945.  Burns has included interviews of service men and women from each of these towns.  Some served on the front lines, some flew aircraft, some sailed on ships, some became prisoners of war, and some served on the home front.  The common factor among all of these men and women was a burning desire to defeat the enemy and return to their lives.These interviews show the viewer the human side of the conflict.  These people were young adults at the time, many leaving home for the first time.  Yet, they left their homes and loved ones to fight a war thousands of miles away.  The interviews give a ""human"" element to the war that the viewer can easily relate to.Also included is authentic footage, both photographs and film, of the war.  By combining this footage with the interviews, Burns gives the viewer a complete feeling of what the war was actually like.This is unquestionably the best documentary I've ever seen.  Oral history is perhaps the best way to learn about earlier events, and the interviews with the survivors provide a first-hand account of what the war was actually like.  There were good times and bad, but the overriding theme expressed throughout was that these people were simply doing a job.  But their sacrifice ensured that future generations would carry on.I give this fine documentary my highest recommendation.

This is the most powerful antiwar statement a film maker can give.I've watched all the episodes and I cannot get over how this portrayal is something every American should watch.  This should be mandatory in all schools so that anyone who thinks being a soldier is glamorous.  Yet we owe a debt of gratitude to this generation that we can never fully repay.  ""United We Stand"" is so meaningless if we fail to acknowledge the price this generation paid.  For critics of our current war in Iraq to dishonor veterans who now speak out against war are mainly cowards who never dared offer to serve our country.  War is not about great victories.  True, the victory in 1945 was unlike anything the allied countries ever experienced before, but the victory celebrations were but the natural response from a repression few Americans living today can fully appreciate.  The sacrafice, the pain, the destruction.  This is what the war caused.  Every veteran will have his/her own opinion on the value of war.  War's psychology is something that may never be fully understood.  If a veteran criticizes a war is it from lack of patriotism or from unhealed scars within?  To criticize a veteran's denouncement of waris a personal attack on individual character.  Listen to the pain some of the interviewees feel more than 50 years after the treaties were signed.This film is Academy Award material.  Not since Ken Burns' ""Civil War"" has he made such a film that showed what war truly is.  I can't say enough good things about this.

He uses Waterbury, Connecticut,-- Mobile, Alabama,-- Sacramento, California, and Luverne, Minnesota to do this.  He uses the cities and interviews people from each of those cities to tell the story of how World War 2 affected America.  It brings in the issues of race, gender, immigration, and the ways in which the war forced America, which has always been plagued by faction, to get on the same page in a way that we are not doing a very good job of today.  It details the sacrifice, the loss, the horror, and the unity that was Our Greatest Generation. The music is spot on, as always with his films, and Winton Marsalis wrote the score.

The film gave me such a broad range of emotions - anger at the stupidity of the men who were running the war; a bit of jealousy because of the way everyone for the most part pulled together to support the effort - including Black and Japanese citizens that were treated so badly; unbelievable sadness at the number of people that died - some unnecessarily; disbelief that something so terrible had to be endured in order to keep two mad men from destroying the world; but lastly and probably most importantly pride and amazement at the dignity of the men and women who told their stories, espcially in the last episode, A World Without War.I appreciated the realistic approach to showing what happened throughout the war on both fronts. Showing some of the horror that the servicemen saw, even though I couldn't feel it the same way they did, showed how low humans can go when they seek to destroy each other, but it also showed what humans are willing to go through to try and make things better.When I was in school we were only told the ""good parts"" of WW 2 - mostly those things that glorified what the Americans did and made it seem like no one else was involved and that it wasn't as terrible as actually was. I always thought D-Day had been one huge success from the start. At some points of the film I was asking myself how the Allies managed to ""win"" after all and sometimes had to remind myself that they did. But that questioning made it more amazing that they did.The War is a good start to dealing with a major part of our history in a realistic manner. And maybe it left out some points of view and some occurances, as others have pointed out, but overall it gave me a new understanding of and appreciation for what Americans had to go through then and how it has affected everyone since.",5,So Many Feelings,1195171200,"11 16, 2007",2007,1886,"['watched', 'documentary', 'local', 'PBS', 'station', 'thought', 'was', 'wonderful', 'film', 'gave', 'such', 'broad', 'range', 'emotions', 'anger', 'stupidity', 'men', 'who', 'were', 'running', 'war', 'bit', 'jealousy', 'way', 'everyone', 'most', 'part', 'pulled', 'together', 'support', 'effort', 'including', 'Black', 'Japanese', 'citizens', 'were', 'treated', 'so', 'badly', 'unbelievable', 'sadness', 'number', 'people', 'died', 'unnecessarily', 'disbelief', 'something', 'so', 'terrible', 'had', 'be', 'endured', 'order', 'keep', 'two', 'mad', 'men', 'destroying', 'world', 'lastly', 'probably', 'most', 'importantly', 'pride', 'amazement', 'dignity', 'men', 'women', 'who', 'told', 'stories', 'espcially', 'last', 'episode', 'A', 'World', 'Without', 'War.I', 'appreciated', 'realistic', 'approach', 'showing', 'what', 'happened', 'war', 'fronts', 'Showing', 'horror', 'servicemen', 'saw', 'even', 'could', ""n't"", 'feel', 'same', 'way', 'did', 'showed', 'how', 'low', 'humans', 'can', 'go', 'when', 'seek', 'destroy', 'other', 'also', 'showed', 'what', 'humans', 'are', 'willing', 'go', 'try', 'make', 'things', 'was', 'school', 'were', 'only', 'told', 'good', 'parts', 'WW', '2', 'mostly', 'things', 'glorified', 'what', 'Americans', 'did', 'made', 'seem', 'one', 'else', 'was', 'involved', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'terrible', 'actually', 'was', 'always', 'thought', 'D-Day', 'had', 'been', 'one', 'huge', 'success', 'start', 'points', 'film', 'was', 'asking', 'how', 'Allies', 'managed', 'win', 'sometimes', 'had', 'remind', 'did', 'questioning', 'made', 'more', 'amazing', 'did.The', 'War', 'good', 'start', 'dealing', 'major', 'part', 'history', 'realistic', 'manner', 'maybe', 'left', 'out', 'points', 'view', 'occurances', 'others', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'overall', 'gave', 'new', 'understanding', 'appreciation', 'what', 'Americans', 'had', 'go', 'then', 'how', 'affected', 'everyone']",N/A

Difficult to watch, and best taken in small doses, this was absolutely captivating TV. Always the military history buff, I remember being impressed by his Civil War documentary, but I really loved this one. You don't watch this series so much as you feel it. As usual, Burn's exclusive use of primary visual sources and first person accounts sets him apart from all other historical documentary film makers. But what really elevates this offering above even his own previous best work is the brutal honesty and sensitivity with which he treats the multitude of personal stories that made up the American experience of World War Two. His plot device of boxing the compass to select four typical American towns (North, South, East, and West) as representative samples of the entire nation was a stroke of genius. Then by following one or two families from each of these towns through the entirety of the war, both at home and on the front lines, Mr. Burns has made a vast and complicated story very direct and very personal. This series is not a traditional treatment of military history. There is little or no discussion of strategy, weapons, or commanding officers. Instead it is an unvarnished look at the human experience of war as seen through the eyes of a representative sampling of average Americans.

There is no point in recreating historical material that has been done over and over again. What Burns did was try to show us what it felt like to be in battle and on the home front. He uses stories told by a diverse but small group of soldiers and their families, and after a while you start to feel that you know them. I was very surprised to see an old family friend in the show on the Battle of the Bulge. He and my family were close for more than 30 years, but I never remember him describing the events he talked about on the show. That is why Burns' approach is so valuable -- most of the veterans who came home went back to their lives and rarely spoke about their experiences.

I'm a history buff and knew I would learn a lot. I made sure to DVR all the episodes as they were broadcast and planned on watching them all right away.  I didn't expect it would take me six months to watch them all though.  That's because the content was so rich and dense that I found I needed to watch it in small doses.  Often, I fell asleep and had to go back to the parts I missed at another time. I even accidentally erased the last episode and had to go to my local video store to rent it.  Now that I have finally finished it, explored all the nuances and experienced its emotional impact, I know I will never think of WW2 in the same way again.A very loose structure tells the story through the voices of people from four different American towns, but they are just some of the many voices we hear, people who lived though it all and are still alive to talk about it.  There are testimonies, letters and old film footage.  There are hundreds of different stories and voices.  In this piece, the world leaders and the generals are the historical backdrop.  It's the ordinary people who just happened to be there which makes this series so great.  And there is no doubt that it will serve future generations who want to understand, really understand, those war years.I'll never forget the story of the young girl and her family who was kept captive by the Japanese in the Philippines.  I'll never forget  the men who fought the Battle of the Bulge.  The sweet Southern girl who is now in her eighties made the reality of the war as experienced on the home front come alive.

I took off a star because Ken was trying to liken the Nazi concentration camps where Jews were slaughtered to the internment camps in the US where some US citizens of Japanese and German descent were kept during the war.  Sure it was not nice and probably Unconstitutional, but it was not wholesale murder.  Putting folks on a bus to the desert encampment was not exactly the same as the Bataan Death March.  I'm not done with the whole thing, but I bet money he does not mention the number of honest-to-goodness spies that were put in the internment camps and were denied information.

1080537,A22RY8N8CNDF3A,B000R7NBMK,"Loyd E. Eskildson ""Pragmatist""","[32, 37]","Ken Burns' ""The War"" dramatically communicates the intensity and savagery of WWII. This includes the sacrifices, worries, and involvement by civilians (fortunately much less in the U.S., but impressive here nonetheless), as well as those on the front lines. One also gets a sense of how lucky America was, having to throw our almost non-existent military immediately into total conflict against fully mobilized Japan, Germany, and Italy - yet managing to hold on until our military could be built up. And then there is also the incredible story of how our industrial resources (factories, design and planning skills, workers) combined to produce the countless planes, rifles, tanks, ships, and other armaments necessary for those on the front lines to overcome the enemy.WWII took place in thousands of locations, and involved millions of contributors' stories. ""The War"" tells it's story primarily through a limited number of individuals coming from four small towns across America in Alabama, California, Connecticut, and Minnesota. The focus is on ""regular people,"" not the high level generals and political leaders. The narrative (often from those there), and photos and newsreel clips are compelling.Viewers are likely to become haunted by a number of tragic questions: Why didn't Germany (Hitler) give up when it was obvious they would lose and were subjecting civilians to massive fire-bombing casualties? Similarly, why did the Japanese choose to organize a massive ""fight to the bitter end"" civilian defense of Japan, despite enormous fire-bombing losses and the almost total loss of their former armed might? Why were some incompetent American generals not relieved?Viewers also learn that Germans had much better winter uniforms (warmer, and better camouflaged - a shortcoming that would be repeated in the Korean War vs. the Chinese), and experience the horror of Japanese POW and civilian internment status.In addition, ""The War"" provides factual perspectives supporting the controversial decision to use atomic bombs on Japan: 1)The Japanese usually fought to the last man, rarely surrendering. 2)Preparations were beginning on the mainland to do likewise, involving civilians as well as the military. 3)Estimated U.S. casualties from invading Japan were 500,000.As one of the participants aptly phrased it, ""We (were) all casualties"" in WWII - even those not wounded and those at home.The WWII generation is fast fading from the scene. We owe an enormous debt to them for their sacrifices and achievements, and to Ken Burns as well for reminding us of what was required and contributed.",5,Humbling and Inspiring,1190592000,"09 24, 2007",2007,2601,"['Ken', 'Burns', 'War', 'dramatically', 'intensity', 'savagery', 'WWII', 'sacrifices', 'worries', 'involvement', 'civilians', 'fortunately', 'much', 'less', 'U.S.', 'impressive', 'here', 'nonetheless', 'as', 'well', 'front', 'lines', 'One', 'also', 'sense', 'how', 'lucky', 'America', 'was', 'having', 'throw', 'almost', 'non-existent', 'military', 'immediately', 'total', 'conflict', 'fully', 'mobilized', 'Japan', 'Germany', 'Italy', 'yet', 'managing', 'hold', 'military', 'could', 'be', 'built', 'up', 'then', 'also', 'incredible', 'story', 'how', 'industrial', 'resources', 'factories', 'design', 'planning', 'skills', 'workers', 'combined', 'produce', 'countless', 'planes', 'rifles', 'tanks', 'ships', 'other', 'armaments', 'necessary', 'front', 'lines', 'overcome', 'enemy.WWII', 'took', 'place', 'thousands', 'locations', 'involved', 'millions', 'contributors', 'stories', 'War', 'story', 'primarily', 'limited', 'number', 'individuals', 'coming', 'four', 'small', 'towns', 'America', 'Alabama', 'California', 'Connecticut', 'Minnesota', 'focus', 'regular', 'people', 'not', 'high', 'level', 'generals', 'political', 'leaders', 'narrative', 'often', 'photos', 'newsreel', 'clips', 'are', 'compelling.Viewers', 'are', 'likely', 'become', 'haunted', 'number', 'tragic', 'questions', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'Germany', 'Hitler', 'give', 'up', 'when', 'was', 'obvious', 'would', 'lose', 'were', 'subjecting', 'civilians', 'massive', 'fire-bombing', 'casualties', 'Similarly', 'why', 'did', 'Japanese', 'choose', 'organize', 'massive', 'fight', 'bitter', 'end', 'civilian', 'defense', 'Japan', 'enormous', 'fire-bombing', 'losses', 'almost', 'total', 'loss', 'former', 'armed', 'might', 'Why', 'were', 'incompetent', 'American', 'generals', 'not', 'relieved', 'Viewers', 'also', 'learn', 'Germans', 'had', 'much', 'better', 'winter', 'uniforms', 'warmer', 'better', 'camouflaged', 'shortcoming', 'would', 'be', 'repeated', 'Korean', 'War', 'Chinese', 'experience', 'horror', 'Japanese', 'POW', 'civilian', 'internment', 'status.In', 'addition', 'War', 'factual', 'perspectives', 'supporting', 'controversial', 'decision', 'use', 'atomic', 'bombs', 'Japan', '1', 'Japanese', 'usually', 'fought', 'last', 'man', 'rarely', 'surrendering', '2', 'Preparations', 'were', 'beginning', 'mainland', 'do', 'likewise', 'involving', 'civilians', 'as', 'well', 'military', '3', 'Estimated', 'U.S.', 'casualties', 'invading', 'Japan', 'were', '500,000.As', 'one', 'participants', 'aptly', 'phrased', 'were', 'casualties', 'WWII', 'even', 'not', 'wounded', 'home.The', 'WWII', 'generation', 'fast', 'fading', 'scene', 'owe', 'enormous', 'debt', 'sacrifices', 'achievements', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'as', 'well', 'reminding', 'what', 'was', 'required', 'contributed']",N/A

Blackburn) would have appreciated this -- but he couldn't be with me, last night, as I watched the first episode of this latest `masterpiece' from Ken Burns.  I tried my best to see it through my father's eyes.  [He was the longest-surviving ""Forward Observation Officer"" (FOO) on any front in WWII. FOO's, always with front-line troops, lasted an average of 23 hours before being killed or wounded; George Blackburn lasted ten months from just after D-Day until VE-Day (Victory in Europe).]My father appreciated ALL of Ken Burns' work (especially the ""Baseball"" series -- Dad was a star pitcher when he was young: he left me his VHS tapes of that one).My father, who almost made it to age 90, lived long enough to author a best-selling WWII trilogy for Canada's largest publishing house. He would have been greatly impressed, I believe, with Ken Burns' latest accomplishment.""Episode One -- A NECESSARY WAR"" aired last evening (on our closest PBS station -- ""Prairie Public Television"" of North Dakota - which gets most of its funding from this Manitoba city of 700,000).  I found myself enthralled by Ken Burns' approach to ""THE WAR.""-----We're taken in quick sequence to four places:  a small town in  Connecticut - close to New York City - ""Waterbury.""  Next we visit the Midwest, (a town just to the south of us, here in Manitoba) -- Luverne, Minnesota; then, off to the heart of the South -- Mobile, Alabama; and finally, out to the west coast -- standing in for all of California - SACRAMENTO (a city of ""110 thousand that feels like a small town"").The opening thoughts --from Luverne MN - are narrated by a familiar voice (from ""Saving Private Ryan"") -- Tom Hanks:""Much of the world was already at war in the Fall of 1941 . . . ""  (and)""There was a saying (in this small town where everybody knew everyone else's business) that, ""If you don't want everyone to know about it . . . don't do it.""In our first glimpse at Mobile, we're introduced to one WWII veteran, now in his 80s, ""John Gray who (because of the color of his skin) would soon be asked to fight a war for `Freedom' - though his own country's definition of that word, didn't include HIM.""Then back to the Midwest for a few minutes: ""Sam Hynes,"" a surprisingly young-looking WWII veteran from Minnesota who was ""barely 17 in 1941,"" recalls how,""You could, all of a sudden, choose to be an adult (just) by signing your name; and suddenly (I see myself as) a fighter pilot - an ""Ace"" . . . or a submarine commander going into Tokyo Bay: It is the opportunity to be someone more exciting than the kid you are.""[To inject a personal note (since my lovely, new daughter-in-law ""Eriko"" hails from Osaka Japan), I was deeply moved by the interviews with Japanese-Americans, now in their 80s, who'd been singled out as enemy aliens, requiring internment.We see and hear ""Asako Tokuno"" -- born in America, whose parents were born in Japan, as she fights back tears, recalling what it was like (on a day's notice) to be sent off to remote internment camps.We're told how this grim process flowed from a simple, innocuous-sounding ""executive order"" from President Roosevelt's office: ""(First,) designate military areas - then exclude anyone who might pose a military threat."" On the strength of which, ""110 thousand Japanese-Americans were forced out of their homes, with only the possessions they could carry, and moved inland.""But it's the interviews with those ""old soldiers"" (Navy, Airmen and Marines too), that really hit home:  Some of these men being interviewed, were still in their teens when they volunteered for military service; they're still comparatively young-looking today.  But you hear some of their stories on this great program - and you wonder how they survived at all.""Glen Frazier"" with the infantry in the Phillipines, (the largest, eventual surrender of Americans in U.S. military history) was among those few who survived the infamous ""Bataan Death March."" A good-looking man in his old age, he quietly sums up the experience in a sentence or two.After a march in which he saw his comrades (and Filipino civilians including women) ""beheaded, buried alive"" (etc.) -- a march on which between 6,000 and 11,000 died (""no one knows for certain the correct number"") -- Mr. Frazier, says, matter-of-factly,""I marched without sleep for six days and seven nights . . . no water and no food. They say you can't do that. But I did.  (At the end of the march) my tongue wouldn't go back into my mouth.""Ken Burns' approach is so well-balanced and suddenly, inter-cut gracefully with such horrific recollections are the peaceful scenes of small-town America - back where ""war bond drives raise one billion dollars in a month.""We learn that ""The War"" cost the U.S. 304 billion dollars (""more than 3 trillion in today's terms"").  Citizens of Sacramento - ""in one bond drive alone"" raised 16 million ""to pay for 96 minutes of the war."")Statistics are parceled out in small digestible chunks throughout the show - again a remarkable ""balance"" to keep the show moving along at a pace that an entire family watching this together, would appreciate. (I watched alone but kept thinking that my ten-year-old grandson would find this as riveting as Ken Burns' ""THE CIVIL WAR.""------Ken Burns reserves the longest, single interview in Program One until the very end.  I didn't catch the name of this ""old soldier"" when it flashed on the screen (I was busy jotting down a note about him). He is an Hispanic-American who joined the Marines -- after the Navy twice turned him down (""too small"").He tells the story of the death of one of his buddies (on one of the Solomon Islands, which he described as ""hell on earth"") recounting how his ""best friend"" died on a night ""so dark you couldn't see your hand in front of you"" - so dark he didn't realize it was his own best friend who'd taken a single bullet of `friendly fire' -- then moaned and cried out in the darkness, ""all night until dawn.""Not knowing who this dying man was, but, like the rest of his buddies,  desperately in need of sleep,  he muttered under his breath, ""Just DIE -- Die, will you? -- let the rest of us get some sleep.""  He runs out of words to say - allowing the viewer imagine how he felt at the moment he saw his friend's body in the light of day.  The episode ends there, with a fade-to-black in silence.How wished I could have turned to my father to say, ""Well . . .  what do you think of it, so far?"" I believe he'd have said (once again) ""Good work, Ken Burns!"" But then, I can hear his voice adding, ""Bet you Canada (and its WWII efforts) will hardly get a mention.""

1080542,A36EW68H08UOCS,B000R7NBMK,"Mark J. Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[2, 2]","A few decades ago Tom Stoppard wrote the clever ""Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead"", a play in which the events surrounding Shakespeare's immortal ""Hamlet"" are played out from the perspective of these minor characters.  Ken Burns' ""The War"" suffers from not giving us the perspectives of Generals and Emperors.After triumphs in historical documentaries like ""The Civil War,"" where history is recreated from letters, other written documents and photographs, Burns' team found a rapidly diminishing embarrassment of riches in survivors who were still available to give their first person accounts of the history of the greatest conflict in the history of humanity.  The filmmakers made the conscious decision to concentrate on four diverse communities: Mobile, Alabama,  Luverne, Minnesota, Sacramento, California and Waterbury, Connecticut, and follow the effects of the war on those cities from the perspective of the people who lived and went to war.In ""The Civil War"" details about Abraham Lincoln and Robert E. Lee were intermingled with insightful perspectives from privates Elisha Hunt Rhodes and Sam Watkins.  How wonderful it would have been if Lincoln and Lee (and Rhodes and Watkins) had been alive to give their first-person accounts directly into Burns' camera.With actual participants from World War II able to give their amazing stories in just that way, we could have had a documentary that trumped Burns' magnum opus.  But with Eisenhower and Patton and Hirohito and Hitler all among the deceased, ""The War"" chooses to all but ignore the world-wide perspective and historical significance of the Bold Type Names of the history books.In the ""making of"" documentary Burns' and company explain their chosen perspective, but Mr. Burns also gives his reason for making a film about World War II at all.  He HAD been avoiding it, although interested parties repeatedly asked him to work on a WWII project.  Then he saw reports that American teens were mistakenly now given to understand that America had teamed up with Germany to fight The Russians in that conflict.If he was inspired by American's lack of education... shouldn't he have decided to educate... better?Imagine ""The Civil War"" told entirely from the perspective of the private soldiers and their families back home, with only cursory mentions of Lee and Grant and Sherman.  In ""The War"" we see glimpses of Roosevelt and Hitler and Patton - but only briefly and from a distance.I understand the film Burns' team has made and why.

They are in their 80s and 90s now and their stories are riveting. They are skillfully captured here in this compelling mini series. The soldiers who fought as well as the people at home who made sacrifices are featured. 4 geographically diverse towns across America are featured so that we can see what it was truly like back then. My mom, as a child growing up in Ann Arbor Michigan tells me about the rationing of goods and products such as rubber. No new tires. Could you imagine people being told today that because of the war in Iraq they couldn't buy those fancy low profile tires for their cars? Back then everyone was affected in some way and, to our benefit, they pulled through.The film documents historical events that are not widely known and then backs them up with personal andecdotes of the people who lived them. Soldiers remembering what it was like first entering liberated concentration camps. And what it was like going up against fanatical and well hidden Japanese soldiers at Iwo Jima. And Hawaiian Senator Daniel Inouye's gripping account of battle and his life saving blood transfusion. These are just a few of the interesting stories documented here.Our fathers and grandfathers fought bravely in WW II. The sacrifices they made are vividly brought to life with rarely seen footage and personal interviews. My Uncle recently passed away. He, my Father and 2 other brothers all served in WW II (2 Navy, 2 Army). My father, anxious to become a soldier, lied about his age to get accepted. To the day he died the Soc Security Admin and the VA were at odds as to his correct age. My father has past away but my Mom tells me that my father served with distinction but had, unfortunately, been demoted to private. My father, a feisty Irishman, had gone out a dangerous night patrol. Upon returning he was written up by a Lieutenant for his uniform being in less than perfect order. The Lieutenant had just recently arrived from the states and had no time in combat. My Dad took exception and slugged him. For that he was demoted. My Dad never shared that with anyone except my mom but it definitely fits into something I could see him doing.I worked in a large nursing home in the late 1990s. There was an interesting fellow, a former WW II naval aviator, who shared his many interesting tales with us. By then he was in his 80s and was confined to a power wheelchair. But that didn't seem to slow him down. He would get up every morning, get dressed (with some assistance) and take off in his wheelchair. Always carrying a positive demeanor, he would be seen enjoying breakfast, talking to nurses, visiting people, preferably ladies on the other side of the large skilled nursing facility. And always he had an American flag mounted on his wheelchair. When his power ran down he would be found in some out of the way hallway taking a nap in his chair with a recharging cord plugged into an electrical outlet.Many baby boomers have fathers who served with distinction. Most, I imagine, were like my Dad in that they did not dwell on their heroics, just came home and started a regular life. This fascinating documentary is the centerpiece of the noble effort to record the history first hand, hear their stories before they are all gone.",5,The war where everyone sacrificed.,1192752000,"10 19, 2007",2007,3410,"['latest', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'documentary', 'part', 'effort', 'people', 'take', 'timeout', 'listen', 'people', 'who', 'fought', 'bravely', 'sacrificed', 'WW', 'II', 'are', '80s', '90s', 'now', 'stories', 'are', 'riveting', 'are', 'skillfully', 'captured', 'here', 'compelling', 'mini', 'series', 'soldiers', 'who', 'fought', 'as', 'well', 'people', 'home', 'who', 'made', 'sacrifices', 'are', 'featured', '4', 'geographically', 'diverse', 'towns', 'America', 'are', 'featured', 'so', 'can', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'truly', 'like', 'back', 'then', 'My', 'mom', 'child', 'growing', 'up', 'Ann', 'Arbor', 'Michigan', 'rationing', 'goods', 'products', 'such', 'rubber', 'new', 'tires', 'Could', 'imagine', 'people', 'being', 'told', 'today', 'war', 'Iraq', 'could', ""n't"", 'buy', 'fancy', 'low', 'profile', 'tires', 'cars', 'Back', 'then', 'everyone', 'was', 'affected', 'way', 'benefit', 'pulled', 'through.The', 'film', 'documents', 'historical', 'events', 'are', 'not', 'widely', 'known', 'then', 'up', 'personal', 'andecdotes', 'people', 'who', 'lived', 'Soldiers', 'remembering', 'what', 'was', 'first', 'entering', 'liberated', 'concentration', 'camps', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'up', 'fanatical', 'well', 'hidden', 'Japanese', 'soldiers', 'Iwo', 'Jima', 'Hawaiian', 'Senator', 'Daniel', 'Inouye', 'gripping', 'account', 'battle', 'life', 'saving', 'blood', 'transfusion', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'interesting', 'stories', 'documented', 'here.Our', 'fathers', 'grandfathers', 'fought', 'bravely', 'WW', 'II', 'sacrifices', 'made', 'are', 'vividly', 'brought', 'life', 'rarely', 'seen', 'footage', 'personal', 'interviews', 'Uncle', 'recently', 'passed', 'away', 'Father', '2', 'other', 'brothers', 'served', 'WW', 'II', '2', 'Navy', '2', 'Army', 'father', 'anxious', 'become', 'soldier', 'lied', 'age', 'get', 'accepted', 'day', 'died', 'Soc', 'Security', 'Admin', 'VA', 'were', 'odds', 'correct', 'age', 'father', 'past', 'away', 'Mom', 'father', 'served', 'distinction', 'had', 'unfortunately', 'been', 'demoted', 'private', 'father', 'feisty', 'Irishman', 'had', 'gone', 'out', 'dangerous', 'night', 'patrol', 'returning', 'was', 'written', 'up', 'Lieutenant', 'uniform', 'being', 'less', 'perfect', 'order', 'Lieutenant', 'had', 'just', 'recently', 'arrived', 'states', 'had', 'time', 'combat', 'Dad', 'took', 'exception', 'slugged', 'was', 'demoted', 'Dad', 'never', 'shared', 'anyone', 'mom', 'definitely', 'something', 'could', 'see', 'doing.I', 'worked', 'large', 'nursing', 'home', 'late', '1990s', 'was', 'interesting', 'fellow', 'former', 'WW', 'II', 'naval', 'aviator', 'who', 'shared', 'many', 'interesting', 'tales', 'then', 'was', '80s', 'was', 'confined', 'power', 'wheelchair', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'slow', 'down', 'would', 'get', 'up', 'morning', 'get', 'dressed', 'assistance', 'take', 'off', 'wheelchair', 'Always', 'carrying', 'positive', 'demeanor', 'would', 'be', 'seen', 'enjoying', 'breakfast', 'talking', 'nurses', 'visiting', 'people', 'preferably', 'other', 'side', 'large', 'skilled', 'nursing', 'facility', 'always', 'had', 'American', 'flag', 'mounted', 'wheelchair', 'When', 'power', 'ran', 'down', 'would', 'be', 'found', 'way', 'hallway', 'taking', 'nap', 'chair', 'recharging', 'cord', 'plugged', 'electrical', 'outlet.Many', 'baby', 'boomers', 'have', 'fathers', 'who', 'served', 'distinction', 'Most', 'imagine', 'were', 'Dad', 'did', 'not', 'dwell', 'heroics', 'just', 'came', 'home', 'started', 'regular', 'life', 'fascinating', 'documentary', 'centerpiece', 'noble', 'effort', 'record', 'history', 'first', 'hand', 'hear', 'stories', 'are', 'gone']",N/A

Certainly many of today's so-called documentarians such as Al Gore and Michael Moore could take valuable lessons from Burns. Two previous documentaries by Burns, ""Baseball"" and ""The Civil War"", were two of the best I've ever seen. THE WAR, however, is far from being Burns' best work.Don't get me wrong, the content you find here is quite good. My consternation is found in the content that has been omitted. Of which, there has been a considerable amount.First and foremost, the title is inappropriate. This is not ""The War"", but rather, ""American involvement in World War II"". Even though the former includes the latter, this film falls far short from telling the entire picture of ""The War"". To be considered an all inclusive feature on ""The War"" means the format should have been vastly expanded to include such events as the development of Axis powers, the dual invasion of Poland and subsequent ghettoization of the Jews by both Germany and Russia.There is no mention whatsoever of the German u-boat terrorism that took place right off American shores on the east coast and the Caribbean, nor of the American citizens who aided them with fuel, food stuffs and other necessities. We see nothing mentioned of the results of the post war Conferences or their resulting suppression of so much of the world's population to communism.Of course this information is available if viewers choose to research, but I believe the overwhelming purpose viewers would watch a program such as this is to gain a full picture of the war. Even though this film is well done, it leaves that picture quite incomplete.

It may not be his best when compared with ""The Civil War"" and ""Baseball,"" but it certainly is the most important in these turbulent times when we are fighting two wars which most of us are virtually totally disconnected from (except for watching TV news).  No ""The War"" is not about Iraq or Afghanistan, but rather the Second World War, arguably the last `just' war.  Burn's intent is evident - he wants to make it as clear as possible that we do not forget that ""war is hell.""  He succeeds by not looking at the broad perspective, but by focusing on the effects of the war on the residents of four specific locales from the four sections of the US - the Northeast, the South, the Midwest and the far West.  We clearly can understand why Tom Brokaw rightly characterizes these people as ""Our greatest generation.""  It is this personalization of the storyline which makes the series so compelling.  Burns and his co-director, Lynn Novick, have done a masterful job of finding a group of elegant soldiers and civilians to tell it like it really was.  What is most compelling is the total commitment and sacrifices that this war required of both our soldiers and the civilians at home.  The contrast between this war and the current war on terrorism where our taxes are actually reduced and our president tells us the best way to fight terrorism is to go shopping is mind-boggling.This film should be required viewing for all those old men who send young men and women (but not their sons and daughters) to die.  A further caution: you cannot watch all 14 hours in a few sittings over a short period of time.

1080575,A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8,B000R7NBMK,Roger J. Buffington,"[7, 11]","This film essentially is World War 2 from America's perspective, and its purpose, which it achieves brilliantly, is to show the impact that the war's events had both on the soldiers, marines, sailors, and airmen who fought the war, and the civilians back at the home front.  The film shows, more than anything else I've ever seen, that the Second World War was a catastrophe that ended up involving, touching, and being a tragedy to, almost everyone.  Like the Civil War before it, it involved the entire country, and in common with the Civil War, for a long time the outcome was very much in doubt.Foreigners who watch ""The War"" may derive the lesson that the Second World War is probably the formative event that taught America that she cannot turn inward and ignore the rest of the world, however she might want to.  To this day this lesson explains most of America's actions abroad.Burns' technique of counterpoising the perspectives of veterans who saw hard fighting and much dying, with those of folks on the home front, is very effective.  The viewer really comes to appreciate the fact that the Second World War involved all Americans, despite the fortunate fact that after Pearl Harbor the American homeland was largely untouched.  I have no way of evaluating whether the films of combat action are accurately matched with the events that the film is explaining at a given time.  But the film does feature superb clips of actual combat footage, which drives home the intensity of the war that our veterans had to endure, often for years at a time.  While many today have forgotten the timeless rule that ""the price of victory is never cheap,"" this was a lesson that those who fought World War Two lived every day.Burns is to be complimented on steering clear of partisan politics or historical revisionism.  When discussing the decision to use the atomic bomb to end the war, he shows that regardless of the modern perspective on this decision, at the time there was no question in the minds of almost everyone that if the bomb would end the war, it had to be used.  As we know, and as the film shows, the bomb was used, and it did end the war.  In doing so, it avoided the need for an invasion (and a continued conventional bombing campaign) that would have cost far more American and Japanese lives.  After the horrendous Okinawa and Iwo Jima campaigns, very few Americans (or Japanese) could have little doubt about that.""The War"" is a brilliant contribution to historical perspective.  In an age where a war involving several thousand deaths is bitterly divisive, this film reminds us that our grandparents endured, for years at a time, a conflict that generated thousands of casualties in a given week, or even in a given day.  As such, the Second World War was a formative event to America (and this film really only involves the American experience).  By reminding Americans and other viewers of the high price of victory, ""The War"" makes an invaluable contribution.Highly recommended",5,A brilliant contribution to historical perspective,1192492800,"10 16, 2007",2007,3000,"['film', 'essentially', 'World', 'War', '2', 'America', 'perspective', 'purpose', 'brilliantly', 'show', 'impact', 'war', 'events', 'had', 'soldiers', 'marines', 'sailors', 'airmen', 'who', 'fought', 'war', 'civilians', 'back', 'home', 'front', 'film', 'shows', 'more', 'anything', 'else', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'was', 'catastrophe', 'ended', 'up', 'involving', 'touching', 'being', 'tragedy', 'almost', 'everyone', 'Civil', 'War', 'involved', 'entire', 'country', 'common', 'Civil', 'War', 'long', 'time', 'outcome', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'doubt.Foreigners', 'who', 'watch', 'War', 'may', 'derive', 'lesson', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'probably', 'formative', 'event', 'taught', 'America', 'can', 'not', 'turn', 'inward', 'ignore', 'rest', 'world', 'however', 'might', 'want', 'day', 'lesson', 'most', 'America', 'actions', 'abroad.Burns', 'technique', 'counterpoising', 'perspectives', 'veterans', 'who', 'saw', 'hard', 'fighting', 'much', 'dying', 'folks', 'home', 'front', 'very', 'effective', 'viewer', 'really', 'appreciate', 'fact', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'involved', 'Americans', 'fortunate', 'fact', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'American', 'homeland', 'was', 'largely', 'untouched', 'have', 'way', 'evaluating', 'films', 'combat', 'action', 'are', 'accurately', 'matched', 'events', 'film', 'explaining', 'given', 'time', 'film', 'feature', 'superb', 'clips', 'actual', 'combat', 'footage', 'home', 'intensity', 'war', 'veterans', 'had', 'endure', 'often', 'years', 'time', 'many', 'today', 'have', 'forgotten', 'timeless', 'rule', 'price', 'victory', 'never', 'cheap', 'was', 'lesson', 'who', 'fought', 'World', 'War', 'Two', 'lived', 'day.Burns', 'be', 'complimented', 'steering', 'clear', 'partisan', 'politics', 'historical', 'revisionism', 'When', 'discussing', 'decision', 'use', 'atomic', 'bomb', 'end', 'war', 'regardless', 'modern', 'perspective', 'decision', 'time', 'was', 'question', 'minds', 'almost', 'everyone', 'bomb', 'would', 'end', 'war', 'had', 'be', 'used', 'know', 'film', 'shows', 'bomb', 'was', 'used', 'did', 'end', 'war', 'doing', 'so', 'avoided', 'need', 'invasion', 'continued', 'conventional', 'bombing', 'campaign', 'would', 'have', 'cost', 'far', 'more', 'American', 'Japanese', 'lives', 'horrendous', 'Okinawa', 'Iwo', 'Jima', 'campaigns', 'very', 'few', 'Americans', 'Japanese', 'could', 'have', 'little', 'doubt', 'War', 'brilliant', 'contribution', 'historical', 'perspective', 'age', 'where', 'war', 'involving', 'several', 'thousand', 'deaths', 'bitterly', 'divisive', 'film', 'grandparents', 'endured', 'years', 'time', 'conflict', 'generated', 'thousands', 'casualties', 'given', 'week', 'even', 'given', 'day', 'such', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'was', 'formative', 'event', 'America', 'film', 'really', 'only', 'American', 'experience', 'reminding', 'Americans', 'other', 'viewers', 'high', 'price', 'victory', 'War', 'invaluable', 'contribution.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A
1080576,A2BIAR1V0PWO27,B000R7NBMK,"Roger Kennedy ""International Military Music S...","[74, 141]","Ok, I am going to be controversial here, and give this new epic only three stars.  I shall try and explain why. I know Ken Burns is cute, and should be applauded for his efforts, but there are a number flaws that need to be pointed out here.  For one this work is far too Ameri-centric for my tastes.  If a viewer with no real WW2 background (and this sadly is the case with most Americans today) were to see this they would think the War started in 1941, not 1939!  Come on, WW2 was fought be over half the world, not just the United States!Now if Burns really wanted to be inspired he could have found one coherrent veteran from each of the major combatant nations, and perhaps a few of the minor ones too, and done their individual stories some justice.  What we have here are a bunch of GIs telling their stories about the War, while giving us very little perspective on the depth and scope of the conflict.  Looking at this work alone will give one only a very superficial understanding of WW2.  It needs to be balanced out with other readings or documentries.  What we have here is bascially a People's History of WW2. And only American people at that! One wonders if Burns brought in Howard Zinn to co-produce this epic.There is a also a very heavy-hand of revisionism going on here.  Burns has made sure that while the actual coverage of the War may be limited, this is not the case with racial issues.  Thus we get very full coverage of the Japenese Internment and descrimination against Blacks, but very little say about Kasserine Pass where the US army had to learn a costly lesson.  This to me is a skewed perspective.  We also get a very heavy-hand as to how these issues of race, gender, etc. are covered.  Burns makes no effort to judge these events in the context of their time, preferring simply to condemn the actions of the past without truly understanding them.  This is the folly of all revisionists today.  Burns, Zinn and co. are more concerned with creating their own propaganada, concentrating on what they think should be coverd on a topic, instead of telling the whole story in the context of its time.  They like to pass modern judgements on the past.I guess I was spoiled as a kid as I grew up watching the comprehensive World at War Series narrated by the great Olivier.  This was produced by the BBC back in the late 1960s.  The strength of this series was that many of the actual key players of the War were still alive.  They provided actual interviews discussing their decisions and actions.  Of course most of these people are dead now, and so documentries today are deprieved of many fine primary resources.  Works today on WW2 must struggle to find anyone still alive and lucid to provide that important connection to the events of the past.  To compensate for this Burns has taken all the old footage of World at War and many other fine documentries and mixed them up, putting his own nice little stamp on them to make his simplistic and slanted view on WW2.I would recommend all viewers after seeing this epic to go out and rent or buy The World at War series.  They will find many of the gaps from this work filled in, and will come away with a much greater understanding of WW2. Those who only wish to see the USA involvement in the War will have to wait a while unfortunately.  The BBC version does have a very full account of the US war effort, with many fine interviews and stories, but its seen within the context of the entire conflict.

It gives us a fresh and powerful and poignant portrait of World War Two.  We have both the home front and combat in both the Pacific and Europe, battle by battle, mostly from President Roosevelt declaring war in 1941 to V-J Day in 1945.  And the home front is viewed through four towns across America:  Sacramento, California; the tiny farming town of Luverne, Minnesota; Mobile, Alabama; and Waterbury, Connecticut.  As always with Burns (and co-director and co-producer Lynn Novick), we have oral reminiscences, then graphic combat footage to show what is being talked about.  In the process, several ordinary people in those four towns emerge as superstar commentators.  And the war's horror really comes alive.Libraries are more likely than Blockbuster to stock THE WAR.  If you want to buy a copy, Amazon.com is way, way cheaper than PBS directly.  The DVD has seven episodes on six disks.  Each episode is about two hours in length, with advisories on the front for strong violence.  Episode one shows how the attack on Pearl Harbor changed life in the four profiled towns across America for both wives and soldiers.  Burns and Novick offer audio commentary, if you have the time to view episode one twice.  We go all the way up to December 1942.Episode two gives us 1943 in 24/7 factories across America, battles in north Africa, suicide bombing raids in Europe, and bloody battles in the Pacific.  On the same disk, episode three takes place from November 1943 - May 1944.  We get Allied forces in Italy and heavy American losses in Tarawa in the Pacific.  Meanwhile, on the home front, factories are booming with productivity, leading to ugly racism.  On one of these episodes we also see Japanese-Americans rounded up and sent to internment camps, and blacks in their own proud front-line combat unit.D-Day in June 1944 is at the center of episode four, with commentary by Burns and Novick, which I did not play because I wanted to hear the oral witnesses instead.  Maybe on a second viewing next year.Episode five is wryly subtitled ""FUBAR"", which stands for ""f----- up beyond all recognition"", which tells it like it is in Fall 1944.

Americans finally get across the Rhine in Germany, after heavy losses in the Ardannes forest, while the Russians are only 50 miles from Berlin in the opposite direction.  In the Pacific, we score big with the capture of Iwo Jima and bombing raids on Japan.Finally, episode seven of THE WAR has V-E Day, the battle of Okinawa and the atom bomb droppings on Japan, V-J Day, and a whole world trying to learn to live without war.

1080596,A27FYYS44LH7KD,B000R7NBMK,Thucydides 1,"[41, 59]","I could agree that one should see Burn's work as a microcosmic view into this gigantic, sprawling war through four lenses of four groups of American townspeople except that he doesn't maintain that continuity. Instead, he attempted to use the same formula as that which worked so well in ""The Civil War"", and to an extent, his ""Baseball"" series.As a comprehensive work about World War II, it was too little, measured by any scale having to do with the actual war.  By contrast, it was too much for a down-to-earth study of those selected to be part of the ""cast"" from four representative American towns and cities. This shortcoming, and the inevitable imbalance that resulted was only made worse by the frequent, overly-applied focus on the ""politically incorrect"" aspects of this war and the time in which it occurred.Overall, this work is inferior to either ""The Civil War"", or ""Baseball"".  In trying to blend the microcosmic with the gigantic scale of the macrocosmic aspects of World War II, I feel that Burns ended up with an uneven, unfulfilled attempt at creating the best view from either perspective.  He ""zooms"" in and out, painting with a very fine, personal brush one minute, and then, colors everything with the heavy ""overspray"" of political correctness. This goes on and on, and comes back again and again, while trying to keep pace with the enormous milestone events of the war itself.In documentaries the creators must be very careful to weigh all factors and assign proportion on the basis of the views, behaviors, achievements, and failures of the people who lived through the period of history being documented, or the whole effort becomes corrupted with revisionist interpretation and false perspective. America didn't win the war because it was either ""good"" or ""bad"". It won the war, ultimately, because it was heavily supplied with natural resources, easily defended on its own soil from all enemy combatants, populated by large numbers of intelligent, hard-working people, capable of creating and deploying hundreds of thousands of strongly-motivated, fresh soldiers, and, it was comparatively nimble and agile in developing and employing the very latest in wartime technology.But, sadly, in summation, it appears obvious to me that Burns was as interested in giving today's American audience a big retrospective ""guilt trip"" about the treatment of minorities as much as he was interested in documenting the most colossal war in all of human history.One good thing I could mention about this work is that it does include quite a lot of wartime film footage that I'd never seen before, but it wasn't markedly different in content from what most of us have seen hundreds of times in other WWII documentaries.Lastly, please, let's get Santayana's quote posted accurately:""Progress, far from consisting in change, depends on retentiveness. When change is absolute there remains no being to improve and no direction is set for possible improvement: and when experience is not retained, as among savages, infancy is perpetual. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. In the first stage of life the mind is frivolous and easily distracted, it misses progress by failing in consecutiveness and persistence.

1080597,AEYEAH3C78BBZ,B000R7NBMK,Tim Challies,"[1, 1]","he War is a new documentary series by acclaimed producer Ken Burns (best known for his series on the Civil War). Something of a unique take on a history of World War 2, the series tells the war through the eyes of four towns from across America. It deals both with the home front--the war years as they were experienced through the lives of the people who remained behind, and it deals with the war itself--the war as it was fought by men from those towns. The series is masterfully made.Some of the Amazon reviewers have argued that there is a little too much repetition in the footage used and others have said that there is perhaps a little too much emphasis in the films on the role of various minority groups. This is not to say that minorities were not involved or important in the war, but it seems clear that controversy surrounding the role of Hispanics led to what some feel is perhaps an inordinate amount of time being dedicated to particular groups. Personally I felt the balance was quite good and the focus on these groups has been very interesting to me precisely because they are too often ignored (though admittedly the footage appended to the first episode seems a mite forced). For example, it was very interesting hearing about the Japanese Americans who on one hand fought bravely on the European front while on the other hand their families were forced to remain behind barbed wire in internment camps. What a strange paradox.Regardless of your feelings on those areas, the series is really worth your while. Even my wife, who is certainly no Word War 2 enthusiast, enjoyed the series since it emphasizes not just the war, but the stories of both groups and individuals.

The idea of viewing the war through the eyes of veterans from four American towns, tracing their experiences and recording their memories (in video and in recorded excerpts from their writings, in the case of those who died), has advantages and disadvantages.  The disadvantages have been pointed out at great length in other reviews, by reviewers whose familiarity with the history of the war far exceeds my own.  I can even agree with some of their criticisms - there was a good bit of repetition, and the lady from Mobile sometimes irritated me too - as I gather the segments featuring Japanese-Americans and African-Americans irritated others.  However, I heartily thank Ken Burns for not giving us a battle-by-battle account of this war, which would have fascinated all the history-channel junkies but left the rest of us out in the cold. And the home front segments provided a welcome respite from the PAIN of watching the battle segments.The lady from Mobile made a wonderful point at the end, when she described listening to the war stories with the other wives, thus learning so much more about their husbands, and realizing later that it was healing for them to tell the stories.  I felt this so many times during the series, when listening to Quentin Aanenson, Paul Fussell, Ray Leopold, Glenn Frazier, and Sasha Weinzheimer.  I think all of them at some point said, ""we don't talk about this,"" and this is seconded by those reviewers who mention veterans in their family who carried their memories in silence.  One thousand of these veterans die every day.  Attention must be paid, we must listen to what they remember, and if possible learn from it - about what discomfort is, about what painful choices really are, about survival, and about sacrifice.I was born in 1945, and never heard anyone tell stories about the war, since my dad was too old to serve (born in 1892).  I grew up in the south during the 1950s, and can affirm the accuracy of the African-American veterans' recollections.  It is ironic that some supporters of our fight against Hitler object to the clips of the Japanese and the black Americans.  I knew about the internment camps but NOT about the way the Japanese-Americans fought for the Allies.  And we cannot take for granted that younger people realize what it was like for black veterans to return to the insults and dangers of racism, and resist the urge to strike back.Be that as it may, this series has brought home to me, as nothing else could, what it was like to be in this war...it amazes me that there were as many survivors as there are.  In a day in which we go to war with much less provocation, it is good that we see up close what it involves, and hear from those who were there the cost that was paid so that we could remain free.  How anyone could think less of our country after seeing this film is beyond me...sure, there were mistakes made by commanders...but it's good to hear about that too.  One hears the famous names praised and rightly so, but we don't always realize that sometimes even Ike made a bad decision.  Vietnam and Iraq are not the only wars where bad decisions have been made.  So let us give Ken Burns a hand for having helped educate those of us who did not know much about this war...and who now want to learn much more, thanks to him...and who will not forget.",5,Attention must be paid...,1191283200,"10 2, 2007",2007,3446,"['not', 'surprising', 'would', 'be', 'disagreement', 'merits', 'treatment', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'idea', 'viewing', 'war', 'eyes', 'veterans', 'four', 'American', 'towns', 'tracing', 'experiences', 'recording', 'memories', 'video', 'recorded', 'excerpts', 'writings', 'case', 'who', 'died', 'advantages', 'disadvantages', 'disadvantages', 'have', 'been', 'pointed', 'out', 'great', 'length', 'other', 'reviews', 'reviewers', 'familiarity', 'history', 'war', 'far', 'own', 'can', 'even', 'agree', 'criticisms', 'was', 'good', 'bit', 'repetition', 'lady', 'Mobile', 'sometimes', 'irritated', 'too', 'gather', 'segments', 'featuring', 'Japanese-Americans', 'African-Americans', 'irritated', 'others', 'However', 'heartily', 'thank', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'not', 'giving', 'battle-by-battle', 'account', 'war', 'would', 'have', 'fascinated', 'history-channel', 'junkies', 'left', 'rest', 'cold', 'home', 'front', 'segments', 'provided', 'welcome', 'respite', 'PAIN', 'watching', 'battle', 'segments.The', 'lady', 'Mobile', 'made', 'wonderful', 'point', 'end', 'when', 'described', 'listening', 'war', 'stories', 'other', 'wives', 'thus', 'learning', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'husbands', 'realizing', 'later', 'was', 'healing', 'tell', 'stories', 'felt', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'series', 'when', 'listening', 'Quentin', 'Aanenson', 'Paul', 'Fussell', 'Ray', 'Leopold', 'Glenn', 'Frazier', 'Sasha', 'Weinzheimer', 'think', 'point', 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'talk', 'seconded', 'reviewers', 'who', 'mention', 'veterans', 'family', 'who', 'carried', 'memories', 'silence', 'One', 'thousand', 'veterans', 'die', 'day', 'Attention', 'must', 'be', 'paid', 'must', 'listen', 'what', 'remember', 'possible', 'learn', 'what', 'discomfort', 'what', 'painful', 'choices', 'really', 'are', 'survival', 'sacrifice.I', 'was', 'born', '1945', 'never', 'heard', 'anyone', 'tell', 'stories', 'war', 'dad', 'was', 'too', 'old', 'serve', 'born', '1892', 'grew', 'up', 'south', '1950s', 'can', 'affirm', 'accuracy', 'African-American', 'veterans', 'recollections', 'ironic', 'supporters', 'fight', 'Hitler', 'object', 'clips', 'Japanese', 'black', 'Americans', 'knew', 'internment', 'camps', 'NOT', 'way', 'Japanese-Americans', 'fought', 'Allies', 'can', 'not', 'take', 'granted', 'younger', 'people', 'realize', 'what', 'was', 'black', 'veterans', 'return', 'insults', 'dangers', 'racism', 'resist', 'urge', 'strike', 'back.Be', 'may', 'series', 'brought', 'home', 'nothing', 'else', 'could', 'what', 'was', 'be', 'war', 'were', 'many', 'survivors', 'are', 'day', 'go', 'war', 'much', 'less', 'provocation', 'good', 'see', 'up', 'close', 'what', 'hear', 'who', 'were', 'cost', 'was', 'paid', 'so', 'could', 'remain', 'free', 'How', 'anyone', 'could', 'think', 'less', 'country', 'seeing', 'film', 'sure', 'were', 'mistakes', 'made', 'commanders', 'good', 'hear', 'too', 'One', 'famous', 'names', 'praised', 'rightly', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'realize', 'sometimes', 'even', 'Ike', 'made', 'bad', 'decision', 'Vietnam', 'Iraq', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'wars', 'where', 'bad', 'decisions', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'So', 'let', 'give', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'hand', 'having', 'helped', 'educate', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'much', 'war', 'who', 'now', 'want', 'learn', 'much', 'more', 'thanks', 'who', 'will', 'not', 'forget']",N/A

Instead of taking this tact, master historian/filmmaker Ken Burns chooses to focus on the stories of a few individuals (and their families/friends) who participated in the war.Now, don't get me wrong...Burns also does enough historical recapping to satisfy a viewer who has no idea what happened (trust me, these people do exist!).  However, Burns masterfully blends that information with the touching stories of individuals who did the ""dirty work"" of the war.As a result, this documentary works on both the micro and macro levels of filmmaking.  On one hand, it chronicles the United States' participation in the war...it is especially interesting to see the blatant racism against blacks and Japanese citizens, as well as the helpful attitude U.S. citizens had towards the war effort (very much unlike contemporary wars).  On the other hand, it probes the brittle human psyche that is created in the aftermath of war, as humans who are raised to never take a life must adopt an entirely new frame of mind while in combat.Overall, this film was the best World War II documentary I have ever seen.
