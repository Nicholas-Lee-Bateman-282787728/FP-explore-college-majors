1317261,A59NEDTG1DHG7,B0031P0D6W,Addicted2Amazon!,"[5, 6]","You know, I really like Tracy Anderson, especially her toning moves.  She comes up with some really TOUGH, EFFECTIVE, CREATIVE (i.e. FUN!) strength workouts.  They are also relatively slow and easy to follow.  No problem there.BUT...And there is a Big BUT - Her dance-like standing abs and arm work can be nice and effective (as in her ""Mat Workout""), or it can be a stressful hot mess (as in her ""Perfect Design Sequences II and III). This is the conflict that I face when I do her workouts.The good: I love the lower body, ab mat work, and I even liked the standing ab and arm work in her ""Mat Workout"" DVD, but during the ""Perfect Design"" series, my enjoyment started to flounder.  While her lower body work was always wonderful and solid, her standing abs and arms moves became messy and rushed...and just not fun and not all that effective.  Why?  Mainly because you're spending more time frozen about which direction to move in than actually moving and working your muscles.  It's so bad that even with repeated viewings it doesn't get much better.  This is exasperated by the fact that Anderson COULD do better is she WANTED to, and just doesn't CARE to.Yes, she is a creative and innovative instructor.  But she also, during my experience with ""Perfect Design,"" comes across as a bit arrogant and very lazy.  She HAS to know that the consumers of her DVDs, the people who help her earn her livelihood, her ""fans,"" if you will, want her to provide more instruction.  She knows this and still refuses to do it.  I think that speaks volumes about this woman's priorities.Nonetheless...In my opinion, ""Perfect Design Series I"" is the least challenging and EASIEST TO FOLLOW of the 3 ""PD"" DVDs.  The moves are challenging and effective, but not crazy hard like Level 3 (I LOVE the chair work in Level 3!  Soo tough!).  Most of the moves are done on the floor, with the shorter standing abs and arms sections done on your feet.While on the floor, you are put through a series of moves that work one side in a row, then are taken through a repetition of the moves working the other side of the body.  Some of my favorite lower body moves here: a move where you are on your hands and one knee while your working leg bends, lowers down, straightens behind you, then bends, is raised and is straightened diagonally towards the ceiling - NICE!; this ultimately transforms into another move where you rock forward and your hands and one knee, bringing the working knee to tap the ground diagonally, then raise and straighten the leg at a diagonal across your body to the opposite corner of the ceiling, repeating without a break - OUCH!, especially right after the previous move!  I also love the move where you are lying flat on your stomach and raise one leg slightly off the floor, out to the side, in to the other foot, rest briefly and repeat - KILLS the butt muscle on the working leg!The floor ab work is also pretty solid.  It consists of unique variations of crunches and lower ab leg raises that really start to burn my abs by the end of the segment.  You begin with crunches done with your legs straight in a V.  You ultimately progress to crunches and held crunches while your legs are doing all sorts of acrobatic movements.  Very pretty, but also pretty tough. :-)As I've mentioned, the standing abs and arms are the easiest to follow here.  Because of this, I get the most burn out of them here in ""PD Series 1.""  I flailed around hopelessly for just 3 or 4 days and then could generally keep along with the craziness!  Furthermore, my obliques and arms were burning by the end of the segment.  You then do a balance movement, composing of raising and lowering your left leg and right arm simultaneously before switching to the other side.  You then go back down on all fours to work your glute and hip with some awesome moves (while on all fours, you raise your bent leg out to the side, just like you were pretending to be a dog on a fire hydrant(!), then whip your leg straight out to the side , lower it then repeat).  After several reps, you then cross the same leg in a curtsey move behind your resting knee and then whip it out straight to the side and repeat.  Whew!  These moves are such a killer on top of my already-fatigued lower body that I can never get through them entirely without resting.I'm really enjoying this...And then there's a stretch near the end that has Tracy leading you SILENTLY through a stretch that's done WITH YOUR HEAD DOWN!  Really??  Again, Tracy's laziness and refusal to do common sense instruction comes to the fore.  All she would have to do is TALK you through it.  She would only have to say, ""And now raise your right hand straight up.  Lower.  Now your right...""  But she says nothing, KNOWING that you are straining your neck awkwardly while your bent down on knees, head to the floor.  She knows what is right, and she refuses to do it.  I like Anderson, but that kind of ticks me off.But ultimately, I really enjoyed this workout and wore it out well until I finally moved on to Level 2.  I would recommend this...to people who like results, like creativity and are not anal about things like ""proper instruction.""  :-)UPDATE:  01/02/14: So Ms. TA has come out with a few new DVDs with - get this - detailed instruction!!  Nice!  :-)  Well, there you go.  I officially have no more complaints about the Tracy Anderson Method! She rocks for doing that! She is now, in my opinion, among the upper echelon of fitness instructors (next to Sylwia Wiesenberg of Tonique Fitness, Jessica Smith and any of The Firm instuctors, that is...).  :-)",4,Good...But

1317263,A3IT1LRJSFL1QZ,B0031P0D6W,"Amanda S. ""ALS""","[2, 2]","I'm new to Tracy Anderson. Truth be told, I resisted her for a long time. But I'm so glad that I ignored my judgment and gave her DVDs a shot. I could not afford Metamorphasis and I found the box set on EBay for a VERY reasonable price!I love the setting of this DVD. I love the coloring and the way you feel like you are in Tracy's private studio (which it may have been) working out one-on-one with her. The best way to do this series of DVDs is to ***watch the DVD before attempting to do it.*** The moves are complicated and require a lot of focus and attention to detail, so watching it before, skimming through will help you to grasp what she does. Also, listening to her explain it helped me correct my form while doing each of the moves. The lower body section is really fun and I like that she encourages you to use your arms in the moves and stay active throughout your whole body. I do other workouts besides Tracy's and using my arms and legs gracefully is very new, but I really enjoy it. It keeps it fun and fresh!The ab section is tough! :) You've got to pay attention to the screen to see when she switches legs during moves because she may not queue. But after doing it a few times, I knew when to change.The standing abs and arms was the most difficult to follow as I don't believe Tracy had a solid routine set up going into filming. I think she went with the flow of the moment and I find that's what she wants her viewers to do as well. At first I felt very confused, but I just went with it. Again, after a few run throughs I am getting better at it. You have to pay attention to her wrists and elbows, but it will come with time.The cool down is nice. I did find it odd how she walked off and rolled her eyes abruptly as if she hated doing the DVD. haha. :) But it was a tough one!All in all, I really love this DVD. It challenges me in new ways. It definitely takes time, patience, practice, and dedication. You won't get it right off the first or second time (especially the arms and standing abs) but keep at it. Once I let go of expectations and let this stuff stand on its own and not comparing it, I really appreciated it.",5,"Fun, Challenging, and Fresh",1357430400,"01 6, 2013",2013,2151,"[""'m"", 'new', 'Tracy', 'Anderson', 'Truth', 'be', 'told', 'resisted', 'long', 'time', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'ignored', 'judgment', 'gave', 'DVDs', 'shot', 'could', 'not', 'afford', 'Metamorphasis', 'found', 'box', 'set', 'EBay', 'VERY', 'reasonable', 'price', 'love', 'setting', 'DVD', 'love', 'coloring', 'way', 'feel', 'are', 'Tracy', 'private', 'studio', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'working', 'out', 'one-on-one', 'best', 'way', 'do', 'series', 'DVDs', '***watch', 'DVD', 'attempting', 'do', '***', 'moves', 'are', 'complicated', 'require', 'lot', 'focus', 'attention', 'detail', 'watching', 'skimming', 'will', 'help', 'grasp', 'what', 'Also', 'listening', 'explain', 'helped', 'correct', 'form', 'doing', 'moves', 'lower', 'body', 'section', 'really', 'fun', 'like', 'use', 'arms', 'moves', 'stay', 'active', 'whole', 'body', 'do', 'other', 'workouts', 'Tracy', 'using', 'arms', 'legs', 'gracefully', 'very', 'new', 'really', 'enjoy', 'fun', 'fresh', 'ab', 'section', 'tough', ""'ve"", 'got', 'pay', 'attention', 'screen', 'see', 'when', 'legs', 'moves', 'may', 'not', 'queue', 'doing', 'few', 'times', 'knew', 'when', 'change.The', 'standing', 'abs', 'arms', 'was', 'most', 'difficult', 'follow', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Tracy', 'had', 'solid', 'routine', 'set', 'up', 'going', 'filming', 'think', 'went', 'flow', 'moment', 'find', 'what', 'viewers', 'do', 'as', 'well', 'first', 'felt', 'very', 'confused', 'just', 'went', 'Again', 'few', 'run', 'throughs', 'am', 'getting', 'better', 'have', 'pay', 'attention', 'wrists', 'elbows', 'will', 'come', 'time.The', 'cool', 'down', 'nice', 'did', 'find', 'odd', 'how', 'walked', 'off', 'rolled', 'eyes', 'abruptly', 'hated', 'doing', 'DVD', 'haha', 'was', 'tough', 'one', 'really', 'love', 'DVD', 'new', 'ways', 'definitely', 'time', 'patience', 'practice', 'dedication', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'right', 'first', 'second', 'time', 'especially', 'arms', 'standing', 'abs', 'keep', 'Once', 'let', 'go', 'expectations', 'let', 'stuff', 'stand', 'own', 'not', 'comparing', 'really', 'appreciated']",N/A
1317264,A24K6CTE0YQPFL,B0031P0D6W,Cydni Perkins,"[4, 4]","Ok, so all the negative things the other reviewers commented on?  The weird costume she's wearing, the fake tan, the shimmer lotion, the odd camera angles, the annoying music, the strange production...those things are real.  And they are annoying.  Sometimes I get distracted watching Tracy in her gray satin knickerbocker pants, working it out.  And there are parts in the music that make me wonder what the producers were thinking.  The DVD is trying so hard to be slick and cool.But none of those things have to do with the workout you'll get if you do this video.  Despite all the weird issues, it's still a good workout.  For the standing abs, I mainly just do the sort of standing abs she demonstrates in the mat workout.  If I watch the arms section before I do it, it's a lot easier to follow.  And this is something I have to do with her videos anyway, because the arm movements go so fast that I can't follow along unless I kind of know what's coming next.  For the part where she tells you to put your forehead on the floor and follow her arm movements, I can watch it first so I know what to do, and then just do it.  I love how that section works my arm muscles against gravity in a weird new way. Then I give myself the nice stretching session I know I want and need.  It's easy to adapt this to fit better, and rotate it with the mat workout so it doesn't grate too much with the annoying parts. I'm glad I got the mat workout first, so I'm a little bit familiar with what she does, and that makes it easier to figure out.Also, I think Tracy learned a lot from this series, and I think it improved her skills as a trainer and as a DVD fitness coach.  She's not marketing this series on her website any more, and the exercises in Meta are filmed in a much simpler way that's easier to see and follow.  I think she took everything she learned from doing this, and used it to create something better.  In the meantime, while I save up for continuity, I plan to do this series and get stronger and familiarize myself with more of her exercises.",4,Still A Good Workout,1363910400,"03 22, 2013",2013,2055,"['Ok', 'negative', 'things', 'other', 'reviewers', 'commented', 'weird', 'wearing', 'fake', 'tan', 'shimmer', 'lotion', 'odd', 'camera', 'angles', 'annoying', 'music', 'strange', 'production', 'things', 'are', 'real', 'are', 'annoying', 'Sometimes', 'get', 'distracted', 'watching', 'Tracy', 'gray', 'satin', 'knickerbocker', 'pants', 'working', 'out', 'are', 'parts', 'music', 'make', 'wonder', 'what', 'producers', 'were', 'thinking', 'DVD', 'trying', 'so', 'hard', 'be', 'slick', 'cool.But', 'none', 'things', 'have', 'do', 'workout', ""'ll"", 'get', 'do', 'video', 'weird', 'issues', 'still', 'good', 'workout', 'standing', 'abs', 'mainly', 'just', 'do', 'sort', 'standing', 'abs', 'mat', 'workout', 'watch', 'arms', 'section', 'do', 'lot', 'easier', 'follow', 'something', 'have', 'do', 'videos', 'anyway', 'arm', 'movements', 'go', 'so', 'fast', 'ca', ""n't"", 'follow', 'kind', 'know', 'what', 'coming', 'next', 'part', 'where', 'put', 'forehead', 'floor', 'follow', 'arm', 'movements', 'can', 'watch', 'first', 'so', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'then', 'just', 'do', 'love', 'how', 'section', 'arm', 'muscles', 'gravity', 'weird', 'new', 'way', 'Then', 'give', 'nice', 'stretching', 'session', 'know', 'want', 'need', 'easy', 'adapt', 'fit', 'better', 'rotate', 'mat', ""n't"", 'grate', 'too', 'much', 'annoying', 'parts', ""'m"", 'glad', 'got', 'mat', 'workout', 'first', ""'m"", 'little', 'bit', 'familiar', 'what', 'easier', 'figure', 'out.Also', 'think', 'Tracy', 'learned', 'lot', 'series', 'think', 'improved', 'skills', 'trainer', 'DVD', 'fitness', 'coach', 'not', 'marketing', 'series', 'website', 'more', 'exercises', 'Meta', 'are', 'filmed', 'much', 'simpler', 'way', 'easier', 'see', 'follow', 'think', 'took', 'everything', 'learned', 'doing', 'used', 'create', 'something', 'better', 'meantime', 'save', 'up', 'continuity', 'plan', 'do', 'series', 'get', 'stronger', 'familiarize', 'more', 'exercises']",N/A

I understand all the complaints--it's dark outside. She looks like a street worker. She does not provide play-by-play instructions. A light shines in her face. Her voiceover directions are bad.Yes, there are some serious doozies. There is a segment in the cool down where your forehead is on the floor and you're supposed to follow along doing arm exercises. At this point I just do my own variations on her arm movements.However, these imperfections are minor to me. Just because I'm over the hill does not mean I necessarily want to see someone in a full-on sweatsuit telling me every little thing she's going to do. That's really annoying to me, but I understand how that would provide comfort to others. And I like the option of being able to turn off the voiceover when it gets to that point. I am fine just watching and following along--you'll get the hang of it the more you do it. Ultimately, all I really care about is an hour well spent.This is a fun, hard workout!",5,Great workout.,1318982400,"10 19, 2011",2011,1536,"['should', 'start', 'off', 'saying', 'was', 'doing', 'Bar', 'Method', 'years', 'only', 'real', 'result', 'saw', 'was', 'huge', 'legs', 'really', 'painful', 'ankles', 'knees', 'Then', 'discovered', 'Tracy', 'Anderson', 'Mat', 'DVD', 'am', 'not', 'secretly', 'publicity', 'team', 'thought', 'wow', 'frikkin', 'butts', 'gentle', 'joints', 'then', 'went', 'later', 'buy', 'dvds', 'QVC', 'cheaper', 'website', 'Post-Pregnancy', 'DVD', 'hardcore', 'insane', ""'ve"", 'been', 'taking', 'break', 'doing', 'Perfect', 'Design', 'Sequence', '1', 'absolutely', 'love', 'understand', 'complaints', 'dark', 'outside', 'street', 'worker', 'not', 'provide', 'play-by-play', 'instructions', 'light', 'shines', 'face', 'voiceover', 'directions', 'are', 'bad.Yes', 'are', 'serious', 'doozies', 'segment', 'cool', 'down', 'where', 'forehead', 'floor', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'follow', 'along', 'doing', 'arm', 'exercises', 'point', 'just', 'do', 'own', 'variations', 'arm', 'movements.However', 'imperfections', 'are', 'minor', 'Just', ""'m"", 'hill', 'not', 'mean', 'necessarily', 'want', 'see', 'someone', 'full-on', 'sweatsuit', 'telling', 'little', 'thing', 'going', 'do', 'really', 'annoying', 'understand', 'how', 'would', 'provide', 'comfort', 'others', 'like', 'option', 'being', 'able', 'turn', 'off', 'voiceover', 'when', 'point', 'am', 'fine', 'just', 'watching', 'following', 'along', ""'ll"", 'get', 'hang', 'more', 'do', 'Ultimately', 'really', 'care', 'about', 'hour', 'well', 'spent.This', 'fun', 'hard', 'workout']",N/A

All of the leg/butt exercises are done kneeling on your knees. Have a thick mat or pillow. There is one leg/butt exercise done in reverse plank position which is very difficult to hold on your wrists-so I drop down to my forearms and just concentrate on getting a good glute/outer thigh stretch at that point. There is standing arms/abs-whcih is way more sporatic-confusing than in Mat. The ab section is good-but short. I do like this workout but it takes a little practice to know what is going on. She ques quite a bit in a voice-over style. Once you really get the routine memorized-you can go with the music only option which is really smart for future use, especially if you do the workout frequently. I really want to get II in the series as I hear it is everyone's favorite.",4,Perfect Design Series: I,1281916800,"08 16, 2010",2010,874,"['first', 'series', 'Perfect', 'Design', 'workout', 'pretty', 'well', 'leg/butt', 'exercises', 'are', 'done', 'kneeling', 'knees', 'Have', 'thick', 'mat', 'pillow', 'one', 'leg/butt', 'exercise', 'done', 'reverse', 'plank', 'position', 'very', 'difficult', 'hold', 'wrists-so', 'drop', 'down', 'forearms', 'just', 'concentrate', 'getting', 'good', 'glute/outer', 'thigh', 'stretch', 'point', 'standing', 'arms/abs-whcih', 'way', 'more', 'sporatic-confusing', 'Mat', 'ab', 'section', 'good-but', 'short', 'do', 'workout', 'little', 'practice', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'quite', 'bit', 'voice-over', 'style', 'Once', 'really', 'get', 'routine', 'memorized-you', 'can', 'go', 'music', 'only', 'option', 'really', 'smart', 'future', 'use', 'especially', 'do', 'workout', 'frequently', 'really', 'want', 'get', 'II', 'series', 'hear', 'everyone', 'favorite']",N/A
