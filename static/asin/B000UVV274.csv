After all, I placed in the search engine a search for family friendly, Christian, Inspirational movies to watch. This movie is under that catagory. While it's only rated PG-13 we were shocked by the very crude language and it went downhill from there. Once the scene of incest (brother sleeps with sister) began we turned this video off and requested an immediate refund for falsely leading us to believe this movie was ""inspirational"". I would not watch this movie with any of my family members, my friends, my adult children and especially my grandchildren! This is inspirational??? We've certainly declined in our rating system and our ideas of what ""inspirational"" means. We intentionally watch and seek out films that are light on vulgarity and certainly where morality and the character of mankind is defined by anyone of any faith in God. The fact that we are Christian made this film even harder to watch. We simply could not watch any longer and had it deleted. Parents, beware: THIS IS NOT AN INSPIRATIONAL MOVIE BY THE STANDARDS WE HAVE COME TO EXPECT FOR FAMILY-FRIENDLY VIEWING.",1,NOT AN INSPIRATIONAL MOVIE BY THE STANDARDS WE HAVE COME TO EXPECT FOR FAMILY-FRIENDLY VIEWING,1350432000,"10 17, 2012",2012,1198,"['When', 'reading', 'reviews', 'was', 'initially', 'pleased', 'first', 'couple', 'read', 'did', ""n't"", 'read', 'further', 'placed', 'search', 'engine', 'search', 'family', 'friendly', 'Christian', 'Inspirational', 'movies', 'watch', 'movie', 'catagory', 'only', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'were', 'shocked', 'very', 'crude', 'language', 'went', 'downhill', 'there', 'scene', 'incest', 'brother', 'sleeps', 'sister', 'began', 'turned', 'video', 'requested', 'immediate', 'refund', 'falsely', 'leading', 'believe', 'movie', 'was', 'inspirational', 'would', 'not', 'watch', 'movie', 'family', 'members', 'friends', 'adult', 'children', 'especially', 'grandchildren', 'inspirational', ""'ve"", 'certainly', 'declined', 'rating', 'system', 'ideas', 'what', 'inspirational', 'means', 'intentionally', 'watch', 'seek', 'out', 'films', 'are', 'light', 'vulgarity', 'certainly', 'where', 'morality', 'character', 'mankind', 'defined', 'anyone', 'faith', 'God', 'fact', 'are', 'Christian', 'made', 'film', 'even', 'harder', 'watch', 'simply', 'could', 'not', 'watch', 'longer', 'had', 'deleted', 'Parents', 'beware', 'THIS', 'NOT', 'AN', 'INSPIRATIONAL', 'MOVIE', 'BY', 'THE', 'STANDARDS', 'WE', 'HAVE', 'COME', 'TO', 'EXPECT', 'FOR', 'FAMILY-FRIENDLY', 'VIEWING']",Four Sheets to the Wind

1096938,A496I3R9QH2B4,B000UVV274,Odii Gis,"[12, 14]","Pleasantly surprised with this film by Sterlin Harjo, I caught the tail end of this movie on the Sundance Channel one day and was immediately drawn to it by its narrative in Muscogee (Seminole?) language. I finally got a hold of the DVD and watched the entire movie.  I wasn't too sure about watching this movie on Mother's Day because of some of its initial scenes.  But in the end, it was a perfect movie for that day.I think it is hard sometimes to make American Indian movies in contemporary settings without being sore about modern Indian social conditions such as alcoholism and racism.  Sometimes such films start out only pointing to those issues and then next thing you know it's like we are yelling at or preaching to viewers.This movie along with such films like Pow Wow Highway, Doe Boy, and Dance Me Outside recognize the sociocultural aspects of Native America but mostly emphasize modern American Indian storytelling by portraying traditional beliefs methaphorically.  In any case, it is a movie about death, awakening, salvation, and rebirth.  Four elements to the wind.For this film, we see the portraits of contemporary living through Cufe, his mother, and his sister in Oklahoma.  Yet through, the deceased father's 3rd person narrative, he tells us of the ongoings as if it was a Muscogee traditional folktale. Very neat and very original.Cody Lightning is excellent as Cufe.  But, Tamara Podemski gives the breakout performance of her career.I give this movie only 4 stars even though it deserves 5.  But, it is Four Sheets to the Wind.

1096939,AQE41QO3NEUMW,B000UVV274,"Ronald Scheer ""rockysquirrel""","[7, 7]","I found this story of young Oklahoma Indians absorbing in the way any story is about young people finding themselves in a world that doesn't offer much of a place for them to fit in. Cufe, the central character is wonderfully played by Cody Lightning, who gives a thoughtful, quiet performance as a young man on the cusp of learning who and what he is. The death of his father awakens him to his real isolation in the world, and through him we understand his sister's desperate lostness as her life finds a dead end, off the reservation in Tulsa.This is a movie about sons, as most of the screen time belongs to Cufe, especially as he opens up to a young woman he befriends while visiting his sister in the city and talks of his grief for his dead father. It is also a movie about motherhood and the pain and fear to be seen in the wonderful performance of Jeri Arredondo as Cufe and Miri's mother. While the film has more than the usual level of emotion, it avoids sentimentality and easy resolutions. It also has moments of wry humor, especially at the opening when the family has to fake a funeral for a man whose body has already been disposed of. Whites in the film, for a change, are stereotyped for their well-meaning foolishness on the one hand and coarse insensitivity on the other. This is a fine film with a Native American voice, and I look forward to more from director Sterlin Harjo.",5,"Slow, gentle, heartfelt . . .",1276128000,"06 10, 2010",2010,1397,"['found', 'story', 'young', 'Oklahoma', 'Indians', 'absorbing', 'way', 'story', 'young', 'people', 'finding', 'world', ""n't"", 'offer', 'much', 'place', 'fit', 'Cufe', 'central', 'character', 'wonderfully', 'played', 'Cody', 'Lightning', 'who', 'thoughtful', 'quiet', 'performance', 'young', 'man', 'cusp', 'learning', 'who', 'what', 'death', 'father', 'real', 'isolation', 'world', 'understand', 'sister', 'desperate', 'lostness', 'life', 'dead', 'end', 'reservation', 'Tulsa.This', 'movie', 'sons', 'most', 'screen', 'time', 'Cufe', 'especially', 'up', 'young', 'woman', 'visiting', 'sister', 'city', 'talks', 'grief', 'dead', 'father', 'also', 'movie', 'motherhood', 'pain', 'fear', 'be', 'seen', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'Jeri', 'Arredondo', 'Cufe', 'Miri', 'mother', 'film', 'more', 'usual', 'level', 'emotion', 'sentimentality', 'easy', 'resolutions', 'also', 'moments', 'wry', 'humor', 'especially', 'opening', 'when', 'family', 'fake', 'funeral', 'man', 'body', 'already', 'been', 'disposed', 'Whites', 'film', 'change', 'are', 'stereotyped', 'well-meaning', 'foolishness', 'one', 'hand', 'coarse', 'insensitivity', 'other', 'fine', 'film', 'Native', 'American', 'voice', 'look', 'forward', 'more', 'director', 'Sterlin', 'Harjo']",Four Sheets to the Wind
