I would never be egotistical enough to write a review and say everyone else who likes this movie is an idiot like so many other reviews put out everyday. I can just give you the reasons I didn't like it. First of all, I am a huge horror movie fan. I like every kind of horror whether its found footage, ghosts, paranormal or slasher, but this movie was boring to me after the home invasion part of the movie started. The killers weren't mean enough, especially the guy, the victims were dumb, they had so many chances to escape however they decided they should hide in the most obvious spots. I know most victims in these horror movies can be real dumb acting but in this one they took it to another level. Just like with a lot of other horror flicks out there, this one had a good premise but failed to back that up at all with little to no character development.  And then to make matters worse the movie has a very weird ending which is another thing that ruins a movie for me. It doesn't have to have a great ending but it needs to at least tie looses ends up and this movie didnt even attempt to.

1637557,A3JWR2O1MZ7VNE,B00BQK4YA0,Elizabeth Renee Blue,"[0, 0]","Just goes to show, there's no accounting for taste. There's another horror film with the same name (a French director- tho it is in English) that I liked far more than this one but it seems like other reviewers feel the opposite. I, myself, find French films reliably satisfying, even their psychological thrillers are more disturbing than straight up American horror most of the time. I'm talking in the 21st century. There are very important and influential French films that came before that too. Just saying that since American horror has declined, the French films have not. Anyway, this particular Home Sweet Home was a fair offering, in terms of technical quality. My main beefs are with the characters, either acting or perhaps the way some were written. The main protagonist was annoying, a victim waiting to happen. I much preferred her friend. I wish their outcomes were reversed. The antagonists were 1) overdone- the female and 2) ok, nothing special- the male. The female in particular was not believable at all. She seemed to be &#34;doing&#34; early Juliette Lewis. She distracted me from the film the entire time. The story itself was very straightforward, in a what ya see is what ya get kinda way.

This is a thriller with almost no gore and no horror.This is definitely an indie movie, the writing and direction were okay, but the breakdown really occurred in the acting (cheesy ""psycho chick"" dialog) and the movie's pace - it felt overly long.It also didn't help that I mistakenly saw the other 2013Home Sweet Homewhen looking for this one.
