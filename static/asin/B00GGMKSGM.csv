""acid reflux06""","[0, 0]","The Big C: Hereafter is the ending of a sometimes great and sometimes mediocre series, which was always elevated by the incredible Laura Linney. For the fourth and final season, the show switches from a half hour comedy to a one-hour drama (though it does keep some comedic moments, just as the 'comedy' episodes had many dramatic moments as well). The writing is great, the acting superb, and the story leaves you breathless.

1678230,AW3VZ5O895LRK,B00GGMKSGM,"carol irvin ""carol irvin""","[0, 1]","There is no way that this could be as great as the other three because the producers cut it down to very few episodes just to end the series. I suppose if they weren't counting on DVD and streaming sales we wouldn't have even gotten that.  This is similar with what happened to ENLIGHTENED on HBO. Given that everyone was thus forced to work on just wrapping it up, they still did a pretty remarkable job.POSSIBLE SPOILER AHEADEssentially, the wrap up is Cathy's actual death from stage four skin cancer. That is why you see the raven on top of her head on the box. There are no new guest stars like Hugh Dancy or Susan Sarandon, as in prior seasons, because there isn't time. Kathy tries hospice care at a facility but then comes back home for in home hospice. All of her relatives have to go through their own crises in letting her go. There is a fashion show presided over by Isaac Mizrahi, the designer, and Cathy is one of the models.  There is a lot of good stuff here. So I'm grateful they finished it and didn't leave us hanging as has been done in the past.  With these cautions, by all means watch season four. Laura Linney as Cathy is of course fantastic throughout.",4,Way Too Short Ending to Great Series,1398643200,"04 28, 2014",2014,1177,"['way', 'could', 'be', 'as', 'great', 'other', 'three', 'producers', 'cut', 'down', 'very', 'few', 'episodes', 'just', 'end', 'series', 'suppose', 'were', ""n't"", 'counting', 'DVD', 'streaming', 'sales', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'even', 'gotten', 'similar', 'what', 'happened', 'ENLIGHTENED', 'HBO', 'Given', 'everyone', 'was', 'thus', 'forced', 'work', 'just', 'wrapping', 'up', 'still', 'did', 'pretty', 'remarkable', 'job.POSSIBLE', 'SPOILER', 'AHEADEssentially', 'wrap', 'up', 'Cathy', 'actual', 'death', 'stage', 'four', 'skin', 'cancer', 'why', 'see', 'raven', 'top', 'head', 'box', 'are', 'new', 'guest', 'stars', 'Hugh', 'Dancy', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'prior', 'seasons', ""n't"", 'time', 'Kathy', 'hospice', 'care', 'facility', 'then', 'back', 'home', 'home', 'hospice', 'relatives', 'have', 'go', 'own', 'crises', 'letting', 'go', 'fashion', 'show', 'presided', 'over', 'Isaac', 'Mizrahi', 'designer', 'Cathy', 'one', 'models', 'lot', 'good', 'stuff', 'here', ""'m"", 'grateful', 'finished', 'did', ""n't"", 'leave', 'hanging', 'been', 'done', 'past', 'cautions', 'means', 'watch', 'season', 'four', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'Cathy', 'course', 'fantastic']",The BIG C - SEASON 04
1678231,A2CP4N7R587T3C,B00GGMKSGM,D. A. Nicastro,"[18, 18]","I first started to watch this series because of Laura Linney. She is one of the most under-rated actresses on this planet. At first, I was not sure that I would continue to watch, but became very involved at the end of the first season. Season two reeled me in more. This was an incredible series about a woman who had stage 4 skin cancer. Then season 3 happened. I don't know what the writers were thinking...the series went in a bizarre direction. I almost stopped watching it. Then, when I heard season 4 would be the last, I knew that I had to see how it would play out. Boy, am I glad I did! Season 4 was the most compelling, moving season of any series that I had ever seen. Cathy (Linney) was seen in the final year of her life, with her family close by. It made my heart break. There are only four episodes but I cried during every one of them. For those who watched the other 3 seasons, I recommend this season because it is far superior to the other three seasons. For those who haven't seen this series, I can only say that season 4 is strong enough to stand on its own without not seeing the other seasons. It has enough content to be a mini-series. I will conclude with congratulations on Laura Linney's Emmy win for this fantastic season.
