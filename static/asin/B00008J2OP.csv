A group of policemen fighting against all odds, corruption and politics.  It could even be stereotyped as a plot of good against evil.  That was the original series.  What they have done on the DVD was to condense it so much that the message, the rhythm, all the meaning is if not lost, very hard to find.  Critical scenes were cut and the plot doesn't make sense any more.

However, this disc is not 'Drug Wars', but is rather a crude approximation of it. They took the 280 minute feature and edited it into a 130 minute trailer. All narrative depth is gone, and character development is non-existent. Also, it seems to have been re-edited so randomly that the plot ceases to make sense at several points. The reissue of this film was pointless, because it is not 'Drug Wars.'
