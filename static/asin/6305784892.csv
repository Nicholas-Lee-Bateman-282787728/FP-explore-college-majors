477795,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,6305784892,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[0, 0]","With the 2010 release of the surprisingly entertaining ""Piranha 3D"", audiences have started taking notice of it's star, Elisabeth Shue, again, and if your knowledge of her work consists of ""Adventures in Babysitting"" and ""Leaving Las Vegas"", I highly recommend her performance in ""Molly"". This 1999 'sleeper' was largely ignored when released (as it is, admittedly, cut from the same cloth as the 1968 Cliff Robertson 'Oscar'-winner, ""Charly"", and 1990's ""Awakenings"", which showcased Robert De Niro in a similar role). What sets this film apart, however, is Shue's often radiant portrait of a sensitive soul entombed in an autistic 'shell', and Aaron Eckhart's equally effective portrayal as her loving, if frustrated older brother. The pair play off each other extremely well, particularly after an experimental surgery gradually, if only temporarily, lifts her mind out of the fog. As she rushes to absorb 25 lost years of growth (including an understandable confusion over her new-found sexuality), he discovers the sister he never had a chance to know as more than a child. While the inevitable reversal is tragic, the message is positive, and life-affirming, for both of them, and the audience, as well.A major plus for ""Molly"" is it's terrific supporting cast, particularly Thomas Jane, as Molly's best friend, a slightly mentally-impaired trustee at the mental care center (am I the only one who thinks Jane and Eckhart look like they could be brothers?), and beautiful Jill Hennessy, as the sympathetic doctor who suggests experimental surgery. In a small but showy role, early in the picture, Lucy Liu, just a year away from ""Charlie's Angels"" stardom, has a cute scene as Eckhart's assistant, dealing with a clothing-challenged Molly.Is this a 'great' film? No, it has pretty obvious flaws and more than it's share of cliches. But it IS very good, and certainly worth watching, if you enjoy Elisabeth Shue and a fine ensemble of actors...and the price simply can't be beat!Check it out!",4,"Part ""Awakenings"", Part ""Charly"", All Elisabeth Shue...",1282348800,"08 21, 2010",2010,1997,"['2010', 'release', 'surprisingly', 'entertaining', 'Piranha', '3D', 'audiences', 'have', 'started', 'taking', 'notice', 'star', 'Elisabeth', 'Shue', 'again', 'knowledge', 'work', 'Adventures', 'Babysitting', 'Leaving', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'highly', 'recommend', 'performance', 'Molly', '1999', ""'sleeper"", 'was', 'largely', 'ignored', 'when', 'released', 'admittedly', 'cut', 'same', 'cloth', '1968', 'Cliff', 'Robertson', ""'Oscar'-winner"", 'Charly', '1990', 'Awakenings', 'showcased', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'similar', 'role', 'What', 'film', 'apart', 'however', 'Shue', 'often', 'radiant', 'portrait', 'sensitive', 'soul', 'entombed', 'autistic', ""'shell"", 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'equally', 'effective', 'portrayal', 'loving', 'frustrated', 'older', 'brother', 'pair', 'play', 'off', 'other', 'extremely', 'well', 'particularly', 'experimental', 'surgery', 'gradually', 'only', 'temporarily', 'mind', 'fog', 'absorb', '25', 'lost', 'years', 'growth', 'including', 'understandable', 'confusion', 'new-found', 'sexuality', 'sister', 'never', 'had', 'chance', 'know', 'more', 'child', 'inevitable', 'reversal', 'tragic', 'message', 'positive', 'life-affirming', 'audience', 'well.A', 'major', 'plus', 'Molly', 'terrific', 'supporting', 'cast', 'particularly', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'Molly', 'best', 'friend', 'slightly', 'mentally-impaired', 'trustee', 'mental', 'care', 'center', 'am', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'Jane', 'Eckhart', 'look', 'could', 'be', 'brothers', 'beautiful', 'Jill', 'Hennessy', 'sympathetic', 'doctor', 'who', 'experimental', 'surgery', 'small', 'showy', 'role', 'early', 'picture', 'Lucy', 'Liu', 'just', 'year', 'away', 'Charlie', 'Angels', 'stardom', 'cute', 'scene', 'Eckhart', 'assistant', 'dealing', 'clothing-challenged', 'Molly.Is', ""'great"", 'film', 'No', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'flaws', 'more', 'share', 'cliches', 'very', 'good', 'certainly', 'worth', 'watching', 'enjoy', 'Elisabeth', 'Shue', 'fine', 'ensemble', 'actors', 'price', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'beat', 'Check', 'out']",N/A
477796,A1HUBEP5DJ6W51,6305784892,Brooke276,"[15, 38]","Earning a comparison to any of Ed Wood's camp classics, this film attempts to pass off Elisabeth Shue as a &quot;Rain Man&quot;-like woman who undergoes a &quot;Charly&quot;-like operation and in the end, loses her gifts in an &quot;Awakenings&quot;-like reversal. In other words, nothing  of originality occurs. The acting is beyond inept (Shue should turn in her  SAG card immediately), the direction bizarre (does anyone look like they  know what they are doing?), and the script loaded with cheap sentimentality  and forced &quot;humor.&quot; The film never really decides on what it  should be: Is it a serious drama? A cutesy comedy? Who knows? As always in  films of this type, the mentally challenged individual is imbued with the  wisdom of the gods, instructing us all on our collective failures and our  need to appreciate life's beauty. Further, this film seems to believe that  if we were only willing to comb the various institutions of the world we  would find people able to change our planet with insightful commentary and  brilliant philosophical theories. That silliness aside, the film remains a  shocking waste because it makes no effort to establish living, breathing  characters, nor does it care whether we understand the story from scene to  scene. But let's get back to Shue.....oh my poor Shue. When she's not  reminding the audience that she is acting with a capital A (she seems to be  saying, &quot;Look Academy, I can really act!&quot;), she poors on the  pathos like it was going out of style.

477798,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,6305784892,"""flickjunkie""","[24, 29]","This is a touching, bittersweet and wonderful film about an autistic woman who gains full use of her cognitive reasoning through an experimental procedure.  Molly (Elisabeth Shue) is a 28 year old autistic who has been  institutionalized much of her life.  When the institution closes, she is  left in the care of her self absorbed brother Buck (Aaron Eckhart).  She is  recommended for a new experimental procedure which transforms her into a  normal young woman.  As the story unfolds we see her grow from a child into  a woman with many sweet and funny moments resulting from Molly's view of  the world through childlike eyes.  As her relationship with her brother  grows, his transformation is as dramatic as hers.The film was charmingly  done with a coming of age quality about it.  There were numerous comical  and heart warming moments resulting from Molly's misperception of a world  she is trying to make sense of.The only thing working against this film  is the fact that this ground has been retraced in so many ways that it  suffers from the tendency to compare it to other films.  It has elements of  `Flowers for Algernon', `Rainman', `At First Sight' and `Awakenings'.  It  is difficult for a film to be fully appreciated when the viewer is mentally  comparing it to all these other stories.  That is a pity in this case  because this really is a lovable story in its own right.Elisabeth Shue  gives us marvelous performance as Molly.  Her portrayal of autism is  realistic and endearing.  She is so childlike that you really sense that  she has the mind of a 3 year old.  Later, as she transitions to the mind of  an adult, she retains that childlike naivet&eacute; that gives the character a  purity and wisdom that is fresh and free from cynicism.  It was a wonderful  performance that regrettably will not be seen by many since this film lives  in obscurity as a single facing on the rental shelves.I rated Molly an  8/10.  On an emotional level, I really enjoyed it more than that, but I  felt compelled to subtract a couple of points for lack of originality.  However, if you enjoy human interest stories this one will certainly touch  your heart.",4,Heartwarming story beautifully acted,957657600,"05 7, 2000",2000,2168,"['touching', 'bittersweet', 'wonderful', 'film', 'autistic', 'woman', 'who', 'gains', 'full', 'use', 'cognitive', 'reasoning', 'experimental', 'procedure', 'Molly', 'Elisabeth', 'Shue', '28', 'year', 'old', 'autistic', 'who', 'been', 'institutionalized', 'much', 'life', 'When', 'institution', 'closes', 'left', 'care', 'self', 'brother', 'Buck', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'recommended', 'new', 'experimental', 'procedure', 'normal', 'young', 'woman', 'story', 'see', 'grow', 'child', 'woman', 'many', 'sweet', 'funny', 'moments', 'resulting', 'Molly', 'view', 'world', 'childlike', 'eyes', 'relationship', 'brother', 'grows', 'transformation', 'as', 'dramatic', 'hers.The', 'film', 'was', 'charmingly', 'done', 'coming', 'age', 'quality', 'were', 'numerous', 'comical', 'heart', 'warming', 'moments', 'resulting', 'Molly', 'misperception', 'world', 'trying', 'make', 'sense', 'only', 'thing', 'working', 'film', 'fact', 'ground', 'been', 'retraced', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'tendency', 'compare', 'other', 'films', 'elements', 'Flowers', 'Algernon', 'Rainman', 'First', 'Sight', 'Awakenings', 'difficult', 'film', 'be', 'fully', 'appreciated', 'when', 'viewer', 'mentally', 'comparing', 'other', 'stories', 'pity', 'case', 'really', 'lovable', 'story', 'own', 'right.Elisabeth', 'Shue', 'marvelous', 'performance', 'Molly', 'portrayal', 'autism', 'realistic', 'endearing', 'so', 'childlike', 'really', 'sense', 'mind', '3', 'year', 'old', 'Later', 'mind', 'adult', 'childlike', 'naivet', 'eacute', 'character', 'purity', 'wisdom', 'fresh', 'free', 'cynicism', 'was', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'regrettably', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'seen', 'many', 'film', 'obscurity', 'single', 'facing', 'rental', 'shelves.I', 'rated', 'Molly', '8/10', 'emotional', 'level', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'felt', 'compelled', 'subtract', 'couple', 'points', 'lack', 'originality', 'However', 'enjoy', 'human', 'interest', 'stories', 'one', 'will', 'certainly', 'touch', 'heart']",N/A

She's autistic, and has been looked after by an institution ever since her parents died. Well, Buck has to visit her when this institution closes down, more than that, he'll have to look after her from now on.

Soon after, he finds out about a brand new operation, one that could and does change Molly's life forever. It's an operation that alters Molly's mind, so that she can communicate and learn more or less just like other people. Will it change her life? Will it change how people think of her? Will it last?It's a bit like how science-fiction used to be. Rather than all space, time travel and parallel universes, it asks a ""what if?"". What if science could ""cure"" autism? How would the patient act? How would they feel about their new way of life? How would they learn? How would their relationships change? What would they tell you about their experiences? It's these concepts and questions the film explores, and I found it interesting. I quite liked how Elizabeth Shue played Molly as well.

Why haven`t I seen it before?""  ""Molly"" is a sweet, romantic comedy that will make you laugh and cry.Elizabeth Shue (""The Saint"" and ""Cocktail"") stars as Molly McKay, a beautiful, young woman with autism.  Her learning comprehension seems to be that of a five year old.  When her care facility closes, Molly is forced to live with her workaholic brother, Buck (Aaron Eckhart of ""The Dark Knight"" and ""No Reservations""), who has only visited her at Christmas.  He has always been ashamed of her.Revolutionary brain surgery gives Molly a chance at living a normal life.  After the operation, she begins learning rapidly until she begins speaking and acting like a normal person.  Unfortunately, like the potion in a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde film, the procedure begins reversing itself.  Molly is heartbroken.  She is fearful of losing the strong bonds she has developed between her friend Sam (Thomas Jane of ""The Mist"" and ""The Punisher"") and her brother Buck.Elizabeth Shue delivers a believable performance as an autistic person.  We watch her transform from an unpredictable, out-of-control child to an emotionally stable, mature adult.  Unfortunately, we experience her pain as we watch her reverse back to her original state.

477805,A20NJAPECFGIR9,6305784892,"nina ""Movie Maiden""","[0, 1]","Long ago Elisabeth Shue proved she wasn't just another blond with a pretty face. In Molly, she proves that she is a wonderful actress and one that could give so-called A-list movie stars a run for their money.Molly (Shue) is a bright, energetic young woman with autism. When the institution she's been staying in shuts down, she is left in the care of her brother, Buck (Aaron Eckhart). This doesn't stand well with Buck who already has a busy life as a bachelor and ad executive. He isn't too thrilled with taking his sister in but comes through and allows Molly to stay with him. Immediately Molly intrudes on Buck's life with her odd behavior. He finds himself stressed out by work and with Molly around it's impossible to get any peace. After going through several trying moments with his sister he hears of a new study and signs Molly up to be a participant.From there the movie turns into fantasy. Molly partakes in brain scans and lessons until she goes through an amazing transformation. Little by little Molly loses her autism and becomes so smart she ends up a genius. With her new mind Molly sets off to have a life of her own. She goes through the normal stages of emotion we all go through. She falls in love, gets jealous, and even copes with the fact that Buck never wanted her around when they were younger. Molly even begins seeing the young doctor Sam who befriended her when she had autism. Soon Molly is brightening up the lives of everyone around her and she proves to Buck that things are not always as they seem.Molly is a lovely comedy for the entire family. It properly displays the serious of autism while bringing out Molly's comedic side. You can't help but grin a bit when she makes her child like noises or when she repeats what Buck says. Shue and Ackhart had wonderful chemistry and you could truly believe they were brother and sister. Ackhart plays Buck low-key. We know he cares for Molly or else he wouldn't put up with her, but Buck also has to cope with guilt for how he treated Molly all her life. Confronting these emotions brings them closer together.The supporting cast was interesting but you rarely pay them attention because Shue steals the show. I was extremely impressed with her performance and feel that if this film had been a major release she could've garnered an Oscar winning performance.The film is not without its issues. The plot borderlines on silly at times. I would've liked to see more of Molly and Sam. It was hilarious when the new Molly set off to seduce Sam but it was cut short. We were led to believe that we'd see Molly in a romance but it never took off. I think that would've been a very strong point to explore. The idea was thrown out there but nothing came of it. I would've liked to see more Sam and Molly instead of the wasted scenes with the doctors in the institution.The worst part of the movie was the ending. It was a complete disappointment to have Molly go right back to her previous state. That's right. Her genius runs out and she reverts back to having autism. This was a huge curve ball that changed my opinion of the movie. I wanted a happy ending because I felt Molly deserved that and I also felt cheated because of how the film was set up. I didn't see the point of having Molly go through this transformation for everything to just go back to the way it was. Maybe it was so Buck could truly see her as a person but the ending didn't work for me.I would've given five stars if not for the ending. I recommend this movie to anyone.

477806,A281NPSIMI1C2R,6305784892,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[6, 9]","There are very few movies dealing with extremely painful issues. It seems these issues are at times hidden in doctor's offices and schools and unless you have a relative or friend with this disorder it might remain a mystery to you.Since recent studies are suggesting that as many as 1 in 150 children age 10 or younger may be affected by autism or a related disorder, this film is relevant and brings awareness to the disorder.Some say it is a result of giving babies their measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) shot and doctors claim it is primarily a genetic disorder. Many parents say the shot caused their child to throw tantrums, lose language skills and tune out. The theory is that some autism stems from a severe immune reaction to the vaccine.There are many treatments which can make a difference in the life of an autistic person. Speech therapy, occupational therapy, behavioral therapy, medication and special diets are of benefit.I first found out about autism while working for a family in the Seattle, WA area and I was amazed at the sheer patience the parents exhibited. If you think your life is at all difficult, spend one day with an autistic child. It takes a great amount of patience, love and commitment.Not only is life difficult for the caretakers, daily life is also difficult for autistic people. ""Molly"" shows both sides of the story.Elisabeth Shue plays Molly and completely captures the extremely short attention spans, indifference to those around her, tantrums and screaming, obsessive interests, preoccupations with various objects, love for identical routines, acute hearing and love of saying ""no"" to every question.Her 32-year-old brother Buck (Aaron Eckhart) suddenly becomes responsible for her when the home she is staying in closes. She turns his world upside down and when he loses his job, he finds other work he can do at home so they can survive.When they discover a way Molly may be significantly helped, she undergoes a brain operation. There is a constant threat that the person who has emerged from Molly's body will again sink into the depths of autism. She starts to make everyone aware of what an autistic person goes through and can express herself in an intelligent manner. In fact people with autism can be extremely intelligent. They are really just locked inside a body which will not let them interact with others in a way society expects.Molly has moments which are so delightfully funny because in any other situation besides a movie, they would probably be embarrassing to a person caring for the person. Molly has a child-like joy and one of the best moments in the movie is when she runs through a water fountain with pure joy and fascination. She can be rather mischievous at times. There are also some rather surreal moments you just have to accept for what they are.She even considers marriage and reaches a level of independence which was impossible before the operation.Throughout the movie, they promote an awareness that we are all valuable human beings no matter what our disorders and that love and patience is sorely needed in our society. Instead of accepting societies tendency to hide individuals with mental conditions, they encourage us to learn more about mental illness and to treat these individuals with the respect all human beings deserve.This is a beautiful story of how a brother takes on the responsibility of looking after his sister and goes beyond the call of duty to make her life peaceful and comforting.Get out the tissues! Throughout the movie, the beauty of the innocence of a child can at times be a bit overwhelming. Especially if you know someone who has this condition.You will cry, laugh and cry some more. I found this to be a roller coaster of emotions and while the ending is not what you expect, it is a mingling of beauty and sadness.~The Rebecca Review",5,Autism Awareness,1048377600,"03 23, 2003",2003,3852,"['are', 'very', 'few', 'movies', 'dealing', 'extremely', 'painful', 'issues', 'issues', 'are', 'times', 'hidden', 'doctor', 'offices', 'schools', 'have', 'relative', 'friend', 'disorder', 'might', 'remain', 'mystery', 'you.Since', 'recent', 'studies', 'are', 'suggesting', 'as', 'many', '1', '150', 'children', 'age', '10', 'younger', 'may', 'be', 'affected', 'autism', 'related', 'disorder', 'film', 'relevant', 'awareness', 'disorder.Some', 'say', 'result', 'giving', 'babies', 'measles', 'mumps', 'rubella', 'MMR', 'shot', 'doctors', 'claim', 'primarily', 'genetic', 'disorder', 'Many', 'parents', 'say', 'shot', 'caused', 'child', 'throw', 'tantrums', 'lose', 'language', 'skills', 'tune', 'out', 'theory', 'autism', 'severe', 'immune', 'reaction', 'vaccine.There', 'are', 'many', 'treatments', 'can', 'make', 'difference', 'life', 'autistic', 'person', 'Speech', 'therapy', 'occupational', 'therapy', 'behavioral', 'therapy', 'medication', 'special', 'diets', 'are', 'benefit.I', 'first', 'found', 'out', 'autism', 'working', 'family', 'Seattle', 'WA', 'area', 'was', 'amazed', 'sheer', 'patience', 'parents', 'exhibited', 'think', 'life', 'difficult', 'spend', 'one', 'day', 'autistic', 'child', 'great', 'amount', 'patience', 'love', 'commitment.Not', 'only', 'life', 'difficult', 'caretakers', 'daily', 'life', 'also', 'difficult', 'autistic', 'people', 'Molly', 'sides', 'story.Elisabeth', 'Shue', 'Molly', 'completely', 'extremely', 'short', 'attention', 'spans', 'indifference', 'tantrums', 'screaming', 'obsessive', 'interests', 'preoccupations', 'various', 'objects', 'love', 'identical', 'routines', 'acute', 'hearing', 'love', 'saying', 'question.Her', '32-year-old', 'brother', 'Buck', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'suddenly', 'responsible', 'when', 'home', 'staying', 'closes', 'world', 'upside', 'down', 'when', 'job', 'other', 'work', 'can', 'do', 'home', 'can', 'survive.When', 'discover', 'way', 'Molly', 'may', 'be', 'significantly', 'helped', 'brain', 'operation', 'constant', 'threat', 'person', 'who', 'emerged', 'Molly', 'body', 'will', 'again', 'sink', 'depths', 'autism', 'make', 'everyone', 'aware', 'what', 'autistic', 'person', 'can', 'express', 'intelligent', 'manner', 'fact', 'people', 'autism', 'can', 'be', 'extremely', 'intelligent', 'are', 'really', 'just', 'locked', 'body', 'will', 'not', 'let', 'interact', 'others', 'way', 'society', 'expects.Molly', 'moments', 'are', 'so', 'delightfully', 'funny', 'other', 'situation', 'movie', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'embarrassing', 'person', 'caring', 'person', 'Molly', 'child-like', 'joy', 'one', 'best', 'moments', 'movie', 'when', 'water', 'fountain', 'pure', 'joy', 'fascination', 'can', 'be', 'rather', 'mischievous', 'times', 'are', 'also', 'rather', 'surreal', 'moments', 'just', 'have', 'accept', 'what', 'are.She', 'even', 'considers', 'marriage', 'level', 'independence', 'was', 'impossible', 'operation.Throughout', 'movie', 'promote', 'awareness', 'are', 'valuable', 'human', 'matter', 'what', 'disorders', 'love', 'patience', 'sorely', 'needed', 'society', 'Instead', 'accepting', 'societies', 'tendency', 'hide', 'individuals', 'mental', 'conditions', 'encourage', 'learn', 'more', 'mental', 'illness', 'treat', 'individuals', 'respect', 'human', 'beings', 'deserve.This', 'beautiful', 'story', 'how', 'brother', 'responsibility', 'looking', 'sister', 'call', 'duty', 'make', 'life', 'peaceful', 'comforting.Get', 'tissues', 'movie', 'beauty', 'innocence', 'child', 'can', 'times', 'be', 'bit', 'overwhelming', 'Especially', 'know', 'someone', 'who', 'condition.You', 'will', 'cry', 'laugh', 'cry', 'more', 'found', 'be', 'roller', 'coaster', 'emotions', 'ending', 'not', 'what', 'expect', 'mingling', 'beauty', 'sadness.~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",N/A
