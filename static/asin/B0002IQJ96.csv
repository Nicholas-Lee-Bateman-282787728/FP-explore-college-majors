836091,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B0002IQJ96,Alistair McHarg,"[0, 1]","There are so many ways for a movie like this to go wrong that it's amazing how successfully it portrays the reality of that most bloodthirsty jungle, high school.  If you go broad you end up with revolting bottom of the barrel humor, ala the American Pie franchise.  If you go dark you risk losing the excitement and exuberance of high school, a place where human personality is constantly evolving.  The high water mark for films of this kind was hit by Clueless, which is frothy, smart, sly, and fun.  Welcome To The Dollhouse resides at the opposite end, though thoroughly brilliant it is at times so painfully honest that it's difficult to watch.  Mean Girls faultlessly rides the fence between theses poles, the pitch and tone are just right - tough-minded enough to be real, silly enough to be charming.Tina Fey, who wrote the screenplay and plays Ms. Norbury, beleaguered math teacher, deserves high marks - her script drives the film's fate.  Director Mark Waters is also responsible for another fine picture that runs the gauntlet between silly and insightful - Just Like Heaven, with Mark Ruffalo and Reese Witherspoon.  In that movie he made me believe a man was falling in love with a ghost - and got me to care about them.  On the other hand, he also directed House Of Yes, an appalling Pinter-esque, drawing room gabfest intended to impress intellectuals - watch that turkey at your peril - Parker Posey notwithstanding.A movie of this sort does not rely on good acting, which is fortunate.  What Ms. Lohan does might be described as charming the camera, but it would never qualify as acting.  However, Waters has surrounded her with eye candy and talented character actors, which can cover up a world of sin.  Tim Meadows, as Principal Duvall, brings an impeccable dry, ironic delivery to the table while Rajiv Surendra, as the math uber-geek, threatens to run off with every scene he's in.  Rachel McAdams is convincing as Regina, the Barbie doll come to life - one can only hope she's an amazing actress and nothing like that in person.  Surprisingly, Amy Poehler is thoroughly uninteresting as Regina's mom, a part that had comedy home run written all over it.Ms. Fey probably knew it would be hard sustain this high-wire performance for 3 acts.  Mean Girls does bog down after a bit, and the resolution is downright facile.  But by then you already like it so much that it just doesn't matter.  Poor Cady, Lindsay Lohan, goes from being home schooled in Africa to surviving the watering hole politics of an American high school, things just got a lot tougher.

Ad...","[0, 1]","For a long time I heard this was a great movie and judging by the reviews and amount of stars given, I rented this recently.I guess I expected it to be much funnier than it was.  If you are looking for a movie with Lindsay Lohan in a more difficult role- but with humor in it, I think FREAKY FRIDAY with Jamie Lee Curtis as her co-star is the better choice.At first I thought those voting so high on this movie might be a more youthful audience who can relate to High School and cliques.  But apparently that is not the case- and besides, who ever really forgets what high school was like?Some things never change- the way social dynamics are in High School is one of those things that just never change no  matter what era you grow up in.I want to stress- this is not at all a bad movie- just not totally what I expected.  If I had seen it on tv, it would have been a movie to watch to pass the time.This is not Oscar Material and I didn't expect it to be.  It was nice to see familiar female faces in the movie that just mere years later, moved on to more notable things in the tv/movie industry.Sadly,in this movie,we are seeing Lindsay in her better days. This is when she was one of the newer kids making her mark in the movies, still had her natural looks intact and actually appears healthy.To view this movie,  and then, by comparison, see media images of her now, is to see how a shooting star can crash and burn very fast.The life of Hollywood has proven to be a road of success or self destruction and often both.  Lindsay would not be the first star to crash and burn due to a life of excess.So, enjoy her ""old"" movies if you have not viewed them yet because the chances of her making a return to where she once was( a successful actress) seems more and more unlikely, as we learn of her latest troubling antics in the media.",3,Amusing but definitely over-rated as a movie,1335052800,"04 22, 2012",2012,1837,"['long', 'time', 'heard', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'judging', 'reviews', 'amount', 'stars', 'given', 'rented', 'recently.I', 'guess', 'expected', 'be', 'much', 'funnier', 'was', 'are', 'looking', 'movie', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'more', 'difficult', 'role-', 'humor', 'think', 'FREAKY', 'FRIDAY', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'co-star', 'better', 'choice.At', 'first', 'thought', 'voting', 'so', 'high', 'movie', 'might', 'be', 'more', 'youthful', 'audience', 'who', 'can', 'relate', 'High', 'School', 'cliques', 'apparently', 'not', 'case-', 'besides', 'who', 'ever', 'really', 'what', 'high', 'school', 'was', 'things', 'never', 'change-', 'way', 'social', 'dynamics', 'are', 'High', 'School', 'one', 'things', 'just', 'never', 'change', 'matter', 'what', 'grow', 'up', 'in.I', 'want', 'stress-', 'not', 'bad', 'movie-', 'just', 'not', 'totally', 'what', 'expected', 'had', 'seen', 'tv', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'movie', 'watch', 'pass', 'time.This', 'not', 'Oscar', 'Material', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'familiar', 'female', 'movie', 'just', 'mere', 'years', 'later', 'moved', 'more', 'notable', 'things', 'tv/movie', 'industry.Sadly', 'movie', 'are', 'seeing', 'Lindsay', 'better', 'days', 'when', 'was', 'one', 'newer', 'kids', 'making', 'mark', 'movies', 'still', 'had', 'natural', 'intact', 'actually', 'healthy.To', 'view', 'movie', 'then', 'comparison', 'see', 'media', 'images', 'now', 'see', 'how', 'shooting', 'star', 'can', 'crash', 'burn', 'very', 'fast.The', 'life', 'Hollywood', 'proven', 'be', 'road', 'success', 'self', 'destruction', 'often', 'Lindsay', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'first', 'star', 'crash', 'burn', 'due', 'life', 'excess.So', 'enjoy', 'old', 'movies', 'have', 'not', 'viewed', 'yet', 'chances', 'making', 'return', 'where', 'once', 'was', 'successful', 'actress', 'more', 'more', 'unlikely', 'learn', 'latest', 'troubling', 'antics', 'media']",N/A

It's ironic because i look like her. We have the same kind of face, i have irish in me but my hair is more brown than red and i have some freckles on my cheeks. But anyways, i liked this movie even though it's a teeny bopper flick, but it was funny. I did however get a little bored at times because it dragged on and lagged a bit, but i enjoyed the attractive blonde ""mean girl"", that starred in NOTEBOOK. i like her dimples and her smile. I don't know if guys liked this movie or if girls liked it more, but my brother saw it and liked it, then i saw it and it's a kind of reminder of what backstabbing b*tches girls can be. i had my share of fights in high school with girls and i won even though i almost got expelledone time but i just didn't take any crap from anyone. And what was ironic was my friends thought i was stealing guys away from them, some girls did it on purpose but i was just friendly, and they liked me and that angered alot of my girlfriends, and they got jealous and ended up hating me which was funny because i was a nice person, and i couldnt help the fact that i was cute. Like in this movie, lindsay lohan reminded me of myself back in the day in high school when we were all obnoxious teens hehe. Good flick. lohan is a great actress.

Oh sure, it took me, what now, six tries to get through the whole thing, but, like a marathon runner doing the Bay to Breakers, I made it.I'm not really sure what to say about it.  It stars the very talented and pretty Lindsey Lohan as a former home schooled child who is transplanted from the wilds of Africa to suburbia-USA (specifically California) where she is exposed to boys, fashion, cliques and all other things that teenage girls are exposed to during their formative years.I remember many a biology teacher telling us that girls mature faster than boys.  Hrm, I'm not so sure that's the case after viewing this, and recalling my own high school experience, I think I can safely say that degrees and rates of maturity are not sex-dependent.  This film kind of argues that point of view as it comments on the trappings of remaining in a state of superficiality, and how competitiveness for things that are transitory, and treating profound things as transitional, are a trap when they take precedent over all other things.  In short, don't be superficial.My favorite part of the film is the opening sequence where Lohan is telling her back story of before she got to the high school in question.  There's a few humorous vignettes as we hear her narration to bring us up to the present time.  Lohan's narration continues through much of the film, like a sociologist identifying social groups and their characteristics.But Lohan's character herself, being an attractive young woman, is lassoed by the popular girl clique, and is molded to suit their needs and desires with a plethora of rules regarding who to socialize with, what to wear, and how to be someone while attending a public school.Like I say, it took me a while to get through it.  Being neither a girl nor a teenager (much less both) connecting with this film was difficult, but, since I had heard such a great deal about it, and since Amazon was offering a stream to its prime customers for free, I figured I'd give it a go.Technical notes; a very solid production, this is a preteen to post-teen quasi-romcom/coming of age film with lots of light comedy.  Most of the humor is attitudinal and not so much in the dialogue, though there are a few zingers here and there.  No real dramatic shots, the over all production is over the top, but then again it's meant to be so.In the end the film has an excellent message, and not just young women with lots of sporadic things regarding social acceptance on their mind, but for everyone who is willing to accept universal parables regardless of how the tale is dressed up.Give it a shot.",3,"Decent movie, but tough to get through.",1337212800,"05 17, 2012",2012,2675,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'compelled', 'watch', 'thing', 'watch', 'did', 'Oh', 'sure', 'took', 'what', 'now', 'six', 'tries', 'get', 'whole', 'thing', 'marathon', 'runner', 'doing', 'Bay', 'Breakers', 'made', 'it.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'sure', 'what', 'say', 'very', 'talented', 'pretty', 'Lindsey', 'Lohan', 'former', 'home', 'schooled', 'child', 'who', 'transplanted', 'wilds', 'Africa', 'suburbia-USA', 'specifically', 'California', 'where', 'exposed', 'boys', 'fashion', 'cliques', 'other', 'things', 'teenage', 'girls', 'are', 'exposed', 'formative', 'years.I', 'remember', 'many', 'biology', 'teacher', 'telling', 'girls', 'mature', 'faster', 'boys', 'Hrm', ""'m"", 'not', 'so', 'sure', 'case', 'viewing', 'recalling', 'own', 'high', 'school', 'experience', 'think', 'can', 'safely', 'say', 'degrees', 'rates', 'maturity', 'are', 'not', 'sex-dependent', 'film', 'kind', 'argues', 'point', 'view', 'comments', 'trappings', 'remaining', 'state', 'superficiality', 'how', 'competitiveness', 'things', 'are', 'transitory', 'treating', 'profound', 'things', 'transitional', 'are', 'trap', 'when', 'take', 'precedent', 'other', 'things', 'short', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'superficial.My', 'favorite', 'part', 'film', 'opening', 'sequence', 'where', 'Lohan', 'telling', 'back', 'story', 'got', 'high', 'school', 'question', 'few', 'humorous', 'vignettes', 'hear', 'narration', 'bring', 'present', 'time', 'Lohan', 'narration', 'much', 'film', 'sociologist', 'identifying', 'social', 'groups', 'characteristics.But', 'Lohan', 'character', 'being', 'attractive', 'young', 'woman', 'lassoed', 'popular', 'girl', 'clique', 'molded', 'suit', 'needs', 'desires', 'plethora', 'rules', 'regarding', 'who', 'socialize', 'what', 'wear', 'how', 'be', 'someone', 'attending', 'public', 'school.Like', 'say', 'took', 'while', 'get', 'Being', 'girl', 'teenager', 'much', 'less', 'connecting', 'film', 'was', 'difficult', 'had', 'heard', 'great', 'deal', 'Amazon', 'was', 'offering', 'stream', 'prime', 'customers', 'free', 'figured', ""'d"", 'give', 'go.Technical', 'notes', 'very', 'solid', 'production', 'preteen', 'post-teen', 'quasi-romcom/coming', 'age', 'film', 'lots', 'light', 'comedy', 'Most', 'humor', 'attitudinal', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'dialogue', 'are', 'few', 'zingers', 'here', 'there', 'real', 'dramatic', 'shots', 'production', 'top', 'then', 'again', 'meant', 'be', 'end', 'film', 'excellent', 'message', 'not', 'just', 'young', 'women', 'lots', 'sporadic', 'things', 'regarding', 'social', 'acceptance', 'mind', 'everyone', 'who', 'willing', 'accept', 'universal', 'parables', 'regardless', 'how', 'tale', 'dressed', 'up.Give', 'shot']",N/A

836114,A2ZF1WW0Z0ZXQD,B0002IQJ96,Robert VerBruggen,"[0, 2]","In a lot of ways, ""Mean Girls"" keeps to what it is expected to be. Lindsay Lohan plays a teenager caught up in the whirlwind of high school cliques, and she pretty much has the same personality she did in ""Freaky Friday"" (though, as a home-schooled girl from South Africa, she's never heard of most new rock acts).There is even a cheesy conclusion, with a moral message about teenage interpersonal relations. However, ""Mean Girls"" throws some new twists into the mix. What results is a highly-recommendable, hilarious movie.Lindsay Lohan plays Cady Heron, a new student at an Evanston high school. Her parents are scientists; they moved from South Africa to fill a job opening at Northwestern University.At first Cady has a hard time finding friends, but she eventually falls in with two outcasts. One is a punkish girl, the other a dopey, ""almost too gay to function"" male.Because of Cady's good looks, the three decide to try an experiment: Cady will work her way into the school's most popular group of girls (ridiculously named ""The Plastics"") in order to report back what they talk about.The obligatory conflicts ensue, and of course the cliquey nature of high school is exaggerated beyond believability. The Plastics have an official dress code, and those who don't follow it can't sit with those who do at lunch.There is boyfriend-stealing (what else?), and Cady finds becoming a Plastic doesn't require much pretending after all. Through Cady, the two outcasts (primarily the female - it comes out one of The Plastics spread middle-school rumors about her) sabotage the group, giving weight-gain bars as a diet aid and foot cream as hand lotion.Of course, ""Mean Girls"" is a comedy, so humor is far more important than the so-so plot. In this regard, the movie delivers excellently. It ventures further into the inappropriate than ""Freaky Friday"" (earning a PG-13 rating) with several racially-themed jokes and a lot of sexual subject matter.One shocking gag even involves a main character's death.The humor is well-written, well-timed and well-distributed throughout the movie. Despite the eye-rolling attempt to give the story a moral, it proves one of the best comedies in recent memory.Finally, on a regional note (sorry non-Chicagoans), there are geographical inaccuracies. It is hardly offensive, though; the indoor shot of ""Old Orchard,"" replete with a fountain, is actually rather amusing to anyone familiar with the outdoor shopping center.Thus, ""Mean Girls"" is recommendable to anyone but young children. The movie's marketing instilled chick-flick fear in many a male, but it proves hilarious across gender lines.",4,"Hilarious, but stupid ""moral-of-the-story"" ending",1117324800,"05 29, 2005",2005,2631,"['lot', 'ways', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'what', 'expected', 'be', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'teenager', 'caught', 'up', 'whirlwind', 'high', 'school', 'cliques', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'personality', 'did', 'Freaky', 'Friday', 'though', 'home-schooled', 'girl', 'South', 'Africa', 'never', 'heard', 'most', 'new', 'rock', 'acts', 'even', 'cheesy', 'conclusion', 'moral', 'message', 'teenage', 'interpersonal', 'relations', 'However', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'new', 'twists', 'mix', 'What', 'results', 'highly-recommendable', 'hilarious', 'movie.Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'Cady', 'Heron', 'new', 'student', 'Evanston', 'high', 'school', 'parents', 'are', 'scientists', 'moved', 'South', 'Africa', 'fill', 'job', 'opening', 'Northwestern', 'University.At', 'first', 'Cady', 'hard', 'time', 'finding', 'friends', 'eventually', 'two', 'outcasts', 'One', 'punkish', 'girl', 'other', 'dopey', 'almost', 'too', 'gay', 'function', 'male.Because', 'Cady', 'good', 'looks', 'three', 'decide', 'try', 'experiment', 'Cady', 'will', 'work', 'way', 'school', 'most', 'popular', 'group', 'girls', 'ridiculously', 'named', 'Plastics', 'order', 'report', 'back', 'what', 'talk', 'about.The', 'obligatory', 'conflicts', 'ensue', 'course', 'cliquey', 'nature', 'high', 'school', 'exaggerated', 'believability', 'Plastics', 'have', 'official', 'dress', 'code', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'follow', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sit', 'who', 'do', 'boyfriend-stealing', 'what', 'else', 'Cady', 'becoming', 'Plastic', ""n't"", 'require', 'much', 'pretending', 'Cady', 'two', 'outcasts', 'primarily', 'female', 'out', 'one', 'Plastics', 'spread', 'middle-school', 'rumors', 'sabotage', 'group', 'giving', 'weight-gain', 'bars', 'diet', 'aid', 'foot', 'cream', 'hand', 'lotion.Of', 'course', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'comedy', 'humor', 'far', 'more', 'important', 'so-so', 'plot', 'regard', 'movie', 'delivers', 'excellently', 'ventures', 'further', 'inappropriate', 'Freaky', 'Friday', 'earning', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'several', 'racially-themed', 'jokes', 'lot', 'sexual', 'subject', 'matter.One', 'shocking', 'gag', 'even', 'main', 'character', 'death.The', 'humor', 'well-written', 'well-timed', 'well-distributed', 'movie', 'eye-rolling', 'attempt', 'give', 'story', 'moral', 'one', 'best', 'comedies', 'recent', 'memory.Finally', 'regional', 'note', 'sorry', 'non-Chicagoans', 'are', 'geographical', 'inaccuracies', 'hardly', 'offensive', 'though', 'indoor', 'shot', 'Old', 'Orchard', 'replete', 'fountain', 'actually', 'rather', 'amusing', 'anyone', 'familiar', 'outdoor', 'shopping', 'center.Thus', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'recommendable', 'anyone', 'young', 'children', 'movie', 'marketing', 'instilled', 'chick-flick', 'fear', 'many', 'male', 'hilarious', 'gender', 'lines']",N/A

Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[12, 44]","I never had an interest in seeing this film because based on the summary I'd heard about it, it was like any other movie with a group of popular girls isolating themselves from everything considered not cool. However, after a particularly ridiculous episode of the reality show ""Basketball Wives"" in which Royce accused the other ex-wives of being ""Mean Girls,"" I finally watched the film. Nothing about the plot was any different than I expected it to be outside of Lindsey Lohan's character being from Africa. That's when things got a little peculiar. The movie seemed to glorify an ignorance about Africa with several occasions of students hopping around like monkeys as though there couldn't possibly be civilization there, or that the main character couldn't possibly see them any other way considering her background. It must all be ""the wild."" But on the other hand the way the students were acting was about as combative as animals in the wild. The first time, I kinda got it, but by the second time it just looked idiotic to me. The Asian girl going ""[N-word] please"" blew me completely, especially considering in real life, I doubt that would ever happen (I'm judging from several personal circumstances with Asian people I know who have been vocal about how they feel about the word). I know this is a movie. I get it, but the depictions of certain groups of people stood out to me more.

836122,A1RHVEZJA30HGW,B0002IQJ96,"Veronica Lake ""Missy""","[3, 7]","Lindsay is on great form, instantly likable as Cady and believable both as a regular girl and a ""regulation hottie"". This girl is one of the best comic actresses of her generation and has created a fully rounded character it is difficult not to root for. Not that she carries the film alone.Of the adults Tim Meadows does sterling work in translating his character with relatively few lines. Neil Flynn (familiar as the Janitor from 'Scrubs') is even better with some great facial expressions as a father as much at sea in suburban America as his daughter. As for Tina Fey... a terrific performance of course and she is still as cute as she was on Saturday Night Live but where she really shines is in the screenplay which sounds real enough (at least for a teen film) and has some razor sharp areas (like Coach Carr's 'lessons').Of course the key group is the titular Mean Girls themselves - Regina (Rachel McAdams), Gretchen (Lacey Chabert) and Karen (Amanda Seyfried). Rachel McAdams creates a memorable High School tyrant, malicous, power mad and cruel but not entirely virtue free. She'd screw you over in a heartbeat if you stepped on her turf, but the nonthreatening Gretchen is allowed some reward for loyalty. Gretchen herself, played by the delectable Lacey Chabert is a character of her own, not just a cardboard minion to follow orders. Neurotic, shallow, desperate, beautiful, loyal and rather uncertain she is perhaps the saddest and most sympathetic of the Plastics - a girl who certainly has the looks and money to make it to the top of the pyramid but who lacked the will or the certainty. Not a problem with Karen (Amanda Seyfried) who has an admirable certainty of herself and her abilities. In one of the films best lines after a telling off from Regina, Cady tries to comfort her:Cady: You're not stupid, Karen.To which Karen replies thoughtfully (without a hint of bitterness or anger):Karen: No, I am, actually. I'm failing everything.Indeed she is. Karen is an airhead, and if not actively proud of it, at least accepting. She doesn't seem cruel herself, possibly because she is simply too shallow and dense, but she doesn't seem a bad person. Which for the second minion (Gretchen outranks her) to the villainous is quite a remarkable achievement.Finally I must mention Lizzy Caplan and Daniel Franzese as Janice and Damian respectively, the outsiders we are rooting for, in theory. They do good work, though I found them slightly dry next to the endlessly dysfunctional Plastics (though that may be something to do with me finding Lacey Chabert much more attractive than Daniel Franzese!)Overall a very good piece of work from all concerned. If you like teen movies then you'll find this a very good one. If you don't, well hold your nose and try it anyway, you might be pleasantly surprised!Overall, this is an awesome movie. Very Funny and creative. Famous celebrities also added are Lindsay Lohan, Tina Frey, and Rachel McAdams. Hilarous but 500 thumbs up!
