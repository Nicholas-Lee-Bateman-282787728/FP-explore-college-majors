1493634,A2SJFJXU4TH4GO,B005LS4MW8,"Alrick Banks ""Helping You""","[3, 3]",This movie probably didn't get a bunch of stars because it shows a man being faithful. This movie provides us with a look at a relationship when lack of trust gets in the way. We see in this movie a Kent (Jason Weaver) who is not surrounded by temptation but is sent temptation (Mandy played by Caryn Ward) . The movie did a good job of showing us that not all of us are the same. I like how the movie let Kent's friend (played by Carl Payne) be the friend who always keeps it real with his homeboy. The movie kept it real and showed that Kent came very close to loosing to temptation. Kent's girlfriend (Gabrielle Dennis) must work on getting her man back. The movie reminds us that we all make mistakes but without forgiving relationships don't work.

Well, since Mr. Perry was not involved, it actually rose a few notches above that level. Oh it contained the usual hint of peachiness I expected, but not as heavy handedly.
