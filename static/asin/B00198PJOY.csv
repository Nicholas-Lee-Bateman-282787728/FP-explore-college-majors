I bought it for our six-year old daughter to teach her about virtues which are hard to come by in today's society.  She loves them and watches them over and over.

As adults, my husband and I find it sort of painful and tedius to watch them with them.  The plots are somewhat ""flat,"" predictable, and not very interesting...for us.  As I said, my kids watch them.  But they don't go back to them over and over as they do with some other shows.
