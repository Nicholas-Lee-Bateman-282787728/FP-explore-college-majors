McQuade,"[3, 5]","When John was a little boy he had no friends, so one Christmas night he wished so hard that his teddy bear was alive, that his wish was granted. 25 years later Ted is a freeloading, pot-smoking wastrel with a penchant for hookers and booze who is becoming an increasingly awkward third wheel in John's relationship with his girlfriend Lori (the wondrous Mila Kunis).In the very best sense Ted is a hugely silly movie, and a very, very funny one. Mark Wahlberg is dependably good as the adult John, who still doesn't really want to grow up. He acts as a straight man to the Seth McFarlane voiced Ted, who is rude, profane, and perhaps a bit racist. Mila Kunis, one of the finest comediennes at work today, is excellent in the more difficult role of Lori: the adult of the trio always at risk, with a less well judged performance, of being the killjoy in the movie.The humour in the movie is very much in keeping with McFarlane's TV show Family Guy, so it might not be to everyone's taste - there is an edge of cruelty to some of it which some may find offensive, particularly if they are fans of Sinead O'Connor, Susan Boyle or Taylor Lautner.Still the movie boasts possibly the funniest fight scene since John Wayne and Victor McLaughlin went at it in The Quiet Man: its worth watching for that alone... and, of course, the luminous Mila Kunis.",4,Be careful what you wish for,1346112000,"08 28, 2012",2012,1344,"['When', 'John', 'was', 'little', 'boy', 'had', 'friends', 'one', 'Christmas', 'night', 'wished', 'so', 'hard', 'teddy', 'bear', 'was', 'alive', 'wish', 'was', 'granted', '25', 'years', 'later', 'Ted', 'freeloading', 'pot-smoking', 'wastrel', 'penchant', 'hookers', 'booze', 'who', 'becoming', 'increasingly', 'awkward', 'third', 'wheel', 'John', 'relationship', 'girlfriend', 'Lori', 'wondrous', 'Mila', 'Kunis', '.In', 'very', 'best', 'sense', 'Ted', 'hugely', 'silly', 'movie', 'very', 'very', 'funny', 'one', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'dependably', 'good', 'adult', 'John', 'who', 'still', ""n't"", 'really', 'want', 'grow', 'up', 'straight', 'man', 'Seth', 'McFarlane', 'voiced', 'Ted', 'who', 'rude', 'profane', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'racist', 'Mila', 'Kunis', 'one', 'finest', 'comediennes', 'work', 'today', 'excellent', 'more', 'difficult', 'role', 'Lori', 'adult', 'trio', 'always', 'risk', 'less', 'well', 'judged', 'performance', 'being', 'killjoy', 'movie.The', 'humour', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'keeping', 'McFarlane', 'TV', 'show', 'Family', 'Guy', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'taste', 'edge', 'cruelty', 'may', 'find', 'offensive', 'particularly', 'are', 'fans', 'Sinead', ""O'Connor"", 'Susan', 'Boyle', 'Taylor', 'Lautner.Still', 'movie', 'possibly', 'funniest', 'fight', 'scene', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Victor', 'McLaughlin', 'went', 'Quiet', 'Man', 'worth', 'watching', 'alone', 'course', 'luminous', 'Mila', 'Kunis']",N/A

It is intelligent, hilarious and extremely well acted.  There is quite alot of non PC material in ""TED"" as well as ""WILFRED"" but when intelligently written that type of material has justification behind it and  does not come across as just silly, immature, raunchy humour.  This film was given to me as a present or else I would not have watched it but I did watch it with an open mind and it was incredibly disappointing.

Nevertheless, Family Guy has matured into a reliable vehicle for cutting edge humor while South Park, in my opinion, became stale - evolving gradually into a formulaic package showcasing its creators' seemingly narrow political ideologies and more recently often adopting extreme gross out humor supported by little, arguably, in the way of comedic substance.""Ted"" showcases the talents of Family Guy's creator Seth MacFarlane on the big screen. The humorous results are often downright hilarious, witty, incisive and novel. There are a few instances of standard bathroom style humor, though they are amped up in ways that gives them new life. However, for me some of the very best parts of this film, much like the Family Guy series, are the rich, reoccurring and exploited pop culture references. If you do not want some key surprises in this film ruined, I strongly advise not reading too many reviews of it before you see it. If you grew up in the 1980s this film will be much funnier if you go in blind to its content. At the same time, the script incorporates humor for young adults as well. There were a couple key references to current icons that I did not get, but that the younger members of the audience absolutely roared at. There is truly something for everyone (except small children, who should definitely not see it). I do somewhat agree with the notion that the film loses a bit of comedic steam when it turns serious, but I also understand why the writers chose to do it. Ultimately the storyline ends up being quite a bit more than just a slapstick or screwball comedy, so a bit of drama (and seriousness) helped increase the total impact of the film.Finally - Mark Wahlberg. . .he is just impressive throughout this film. He's an incredibly versatile actor and in ""Ted"" he demonstrates once again that he can also be very, very funny.Check out ""Ted.""

1478719,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B005LAII12,Chris Kennison,"[3, 5]","Seth MacFarlane who became famous for his animated Fox television show ""Family Guy"" is making his film debut with ""Ted"", a movie about a boy and his teddy bear. How sweet. If you know anything about Seth MacFarlane and ""Family Guy"" you know that there is nothing `sweet' about ""Ted"", although you may be surprised.Mark Wahlberg plays John Bennett, a Boston kid with no friends. Even the Jewish kid who's getting pummeled by a mob of neighbor kids doesn't want to make friends with him. So when he receives a teddy bear for Christmas (a talking teddy bear with a sweet little, ""I Love You"" voice), he has a brand new best friend, but he only wishes that the bear could really talk so they could really be friends. In this movie, wishes come true.""Ted"", the movie, is crass, offensive, rude, obnoxious, gross, sophomoric, disgusting, childish, offensive (did I say that already?) and surprisingly heartfelt. Yes, that's true. The biggest, most surprising thing about ""Ted"" is that it has a heart. Somewhere in the midst of all the slosh and rudeness, the movie manages to make you care and feel a real genuine kinship with John and his rude, prostitute hiring, dope smoking, ""Flash"" loving, party throwing teddy bear.If you're offended easily, ""Ted"" is not for you. It will offend. That's a guarantee. There are no rocks left unturned when it comes to offensiveness. Although, the last two-thirds of the movie changes tone a bit and becomes something different. Oh, it's still offensive at times, but the characters begin to be fleshed out, and the people who enjoyed the first two-thirds, may not enjoy the last one-third as much. They were smart enough to keep some pretty good jokes near the end as well.""Ted"" is not just a movie about a teddy bear and it isn't just a one-gimmick type movie either. The writing is good, although some of the plot twists in the last part of the movie were a little predictable and silly. The jokes are numerous and MacFarlane used every trick he had to keep them rolling from offensiveness, to thinkers, to spoof and then some. Some of the jokes, I thought, were actually really intelligent.I certainly don't recommend this movie to everybody, but if you can take a joke and don't mind no limits joke telling, you will have a great time at the theatre.

1478756,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B005LAII12,C. Sawin,"[181, 236]","When you grow up with a woman who makes teddy bears by hand and sells them for a living, they kind of become that extra member of the family. As a child, there were times when the bears would be in positions or places that weren't where they were thought to have been left. Our theory was that whenever we weren't around, whether it was if we left the house or went to bed or whatever, the bears would get up and throw parties when we weren't around. So any movie that features something like a living teddy bear that can talk probably resonates a bit more on this end than for the average person.""Ted"" pretty much already had that nostalgic factor to it with the concept alone. While Seth MacFarlane doesn't always hit it out of the park with each episode of ""Family Guy,"" ""American Dad,"" or ""The Cleveland Show,"" when he does get it right it's something special; it's hilarious, it's emotional, and its references are spot-on. ""Ted"" is MacFarlane at his best. The trademarks he's known for are all in there whether it's the incredible music that is heavily Frank Sinatra inspired, the ridiculous movie and pop culture references, or the humor that always seems to take a flying leap over whatever the accepted standard might be; it's all in the stuffing/inner workings of ""Ted."" The only difference is this is a different medium; a different plane for MacFarlane to bring his offbeat humor and influences into.The spin MacFarlane puts on a familiar story is what makes everything so good. Of course, hearing Patrick Stewart as the narrator is a pretty great way to start any movie. There are a few surprises in ""Ted"" that are worth keeping that way. There's this huge emphasis on ""Flash Gordon"" that results in some really memorable sequences.By now, you've probably heard the thunder song that John and Ted sing whenever a thunderstorm hits. It's still funny no matter how many times you hear it. Giovanni Ribisi was the best part of last year's ""The Rum Diary"" and he always seems to show up when you least expect him to like in ""Avatar"" or ""Public Enemies."" He has the most hilarious sequence he's ever been a part of in ""Ted."" It'll be difficult not to think of this particular scene whenever you see him from now on.""Ted"" is an R-rated comedy first and foremost, but it also crams a lot of heart into its 106-minute run time. The strain that's put on both the relationship between John and Ted and John and Lori's relationship results in the last twenty or so minutes of the movie being purely emotional. So while you'll more than likely remember the movie for the farting scene at the restaurant, the dirty fozzy scene at the grocery store, or the most amazing hotel room brawl involving a teddy bear that you've ever seen, ""Ted"" is secretly setting you up for that tight feeling in your chest when that pull string on your heart is tugged a little too hard.""Ted"" is the best thing Mark Wahlberg has been a part of since ""The Fighter."" It also gives the impression that Seth MacFarlane is still in the upswing of his prime and still has a lot to offer to anyone who's a fan of comedy in general. With its magnificently rich score, flawless use of CG, heartfelt sucker punch neatly tucked away at its core, and endless barrage of references and foul mouthed and vulgar humor, ""Ted"" gives ""21 Jump Street"" a run for the funniest R-rated comedy of the year. In fact, it may even get your vote as the best comedy of the year. It's like 2012's secret weapon for comedy at least until we can get our hands on an Apache helicopter.",5,A downright hilarious R-rated comedy with a lot of heart,1340928000,"06 29, 2012",2012,3532,"['When', 'grow', 'up', 'woman', 'who', 'teddy', 'bears', 'hand', 'living', 'kind', 'become', 'extra', 'member', 'family', 'child', 'were', 'times', 'when', 'bears', 'would', 'be', 'positions', 'places', 'were', ""n't"", 'where', 'were', 'thought', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'theory', 'was', 'were', ""n't"", 'around', 'was', 'left', 'house', 'went', 'bed', 'whatever', 'bears', 'would', 'get', 'up', 'throw', 'parties', 'when', 'were', ""n't"", 'around', 'So', 'movie', 'something', 'living', 'teddy', 'can', 'talk', 'probably', 'bit', 'more', 'end', 'average', 'person', 'Ted', 'pretty', 'much', 'already', 'had', 'nostalgic', 'factor', 'concept', 'alone', 'Seth', 'MacFarlane', ""n't"", 'always', 'hit', 'park', 'episode', 'Family', 'Guy', 'American', 'Dad', 'Cleveland', 'Show', 'when', 'get', 'right', 'something', 'special', 'hilarious', 'emotional', 'references', 'are', 'spot-on', 'Ted', 'MacFarlane', 'best', 'trademarks', 'known', 'are', 'incredible', 'music', 'heavily', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'inspired', 'ridiculous', 'movie', 'pop', 'culture', 'references', 'humor', 'always', 'take', 'flying', 'leap', 'whatever', 'accepted', 'standard', 'might', 'be', 'stuffing/inner', 'workings', 'Ted', 'only', 'difference', 'different', 'medium', 'different', 'plane', 'MacFarlane', 'bring', 'offbeat', 'humor', 'influences', 'into.The', 'spin', 'MacFarlane', 'familiar', 'story', 'what', 'everything', 'so', 'good', 'course', 'hearing', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'narrator', 'pretty', 'great', 'way', 'start', 'movie', 'are', 'few', 'surprises', 'Ted', 'are', 'worth', 'keeping', 'way', 'huge', 'emphasis', 'Flash', 'Gordon', 'results', 'really', 'memorable', 'sequences.By', 'now', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'heard', 'thunder', 'song', 'John', 'Ted', 'sing', 'whenever', 'thunderstorm', 'still', 'funny', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'hear', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'was', 'best', 'part', 'last', 'year', 'Rum', 'Diary', 'always', 'show', 'up', 'when', 'least', 'expect', 'like', 'Avatar', 'Public', 'Enemies', 'most', 'hilarious', 'sequence', 'ever', 'been', 'part', 'Ted', ""'ll"", 'be', 'difficult', 'not', 'think', 'particular', 'scene', 'whenever', 'see', 'now', 'Ted', 'R-rated', 'comedy', 'first', 'foremost', 'also', 'lot', 'heart', '106-minute', 'run', 'time', 'strain', 'put', 'relationship', 'John', 'Ted', 'John', 'Lori', 'relationship', 'results', 'last', 'twenty', 'so', 'minutes', 'movie', 'being', 'purely', 'emotional', 'So', ""'ll"", 'more', 'likely', 'remember', 'movie', 'farting', 'scene', 'restaurant', 'dirty', 'fozzy', 'scene', 'grocery', 'store', 'most', 'amazing', 'hotel', 'room', 'brawl', 'involving', 'teddy', 'bear', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Ted', 'secretly', 'setting', 'up', 'tight', 'feeling', 'chest', 'when', 'pull', 'string', 'heart', 'tugged', 'little', 'too', 'hard', 'Ted', 'best', 'thing', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'been', 'part', 'Fighter', 'also', 'impression', 'Seth', 'MacFarlane', 'still', 'upswing', 'prime', 'still', 'lot', 'offer', 'anyone', 'who', 'fan', 'comedy', 'general', 'magnificently', 'rich', 'score', 'flawless', 'use', 'CG', 'heartfelt', 'sucker', 'punch', 'neatly', 'tucked', 'away', 'core', 'endless', 'barrage', 'references', 'foul', 'mouthed', 'vulgar', 'humor', 'Ted', '21', 'Jump', 'Street', 'run', 'funniest', 'R-rated', 'comedy', 'year', 'fact', 'may', 'even', 'get', 'vote', 'best', 'comedy', 'year', '2012', 'secret', 'weapon', 'comedy', 'least', 'can', 'get', 'hands', 'Apache', 'helicopter']",N/A

However, MacFarlane has managed to bring the zaniness of his TV work to the big screen, creating the best so-stupid-it's-kinda-smart movie since the first HANGOVER.  The jokes come quick and often, with the randomness that made FAMILY GUY such a hit (this is basically an extended episode, which is both as good and troublesome as you may expect).The cast features several FAMILY GUY alum, as well as some stellar celeb cameos.  Giovani Ribisi disappears into his role as a creep with a Ted fetish; Joel McHale excels as Lori's horny boss; and Patrick Stewart provides some excellent (and hilarious) narration.  But the heart and soul here is the trio: Mark Wahlberg, proving finally that he has the comedic chops he's been trying to convince us he has; Mila Kunis, matching him step for step; and the true star, director/writer/producer Seth MacFarlane, who voices Ted to perfection.  The bear truly comes alive; kudos to the CG team for making such a realistic animated star.  However, without MacFarlane's vocal screen presence, the film could have fallen flat.  Instead, we've got a raunchy laugh-fest.  Granted, it's not for everyone: if teddy bears making love on produce isn't your thing, you may want to look elsewhere.  But for FAMILY GUY fans, or for people who enjoy comedy that's not quite so high-brow, TED is a must-see.",4,Lowbrow comedy at its peak.,1355270400,"12 12, 2012",2012,1977,"['name', 'Ted', 'teddy', 'bear', 'brought', 'life', 'wish', 'lonely', 'child', 'children', 'do', 'pair', 'grew', 'up', 'world', 'accustomed', 'talking', 'stuffed', 'animal', 'so', 'much', 'Ted', 'now', 'stoner', 'who', 'thunder', 'buddy', 'John', 'John', 'relationship', 'stunning', 'Lori', 'four', 'years', 'Lori', 'fed', 'up', 'forces', 'John', 'make', 'choice', 'bear.It', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'one-joke', 'pony', 'Seth', 'MacFarlane', 'helm', 'was', 'definite', 'possibility', 'MacFarlane', 'work', 'hit-and-miss', 'gut-busting', 'episode', 'FAMILY', 'GUY', 'AMERICAN', 'DAD', 'one', 'simply', 'However', 'MacFarlane', 'managed', 'bring', 'zaniness', 'TV', 'work', 'big', 'screen', 'creating', 'best', ""so-stupid-it's-kinda-smart"", 'movie', 'first', 'HANGOVER', 'jokes', 'come', 'quick', 'often', 'randomness', 'made', 'FAMILY', 'GUY', 'hit', 'basically', 'extended', 'episode', 'good', 'troublesome', 'may', 'expect', '.The', 'cast', 'features', 'several', 'FAMILY', 'GUY', 'alum', 'as', 'well', 'stellar', 'celeb', 'cameos', 'Giovani', 'Ribisi', 'role', 'creep', 'Ted', 'fetish', 'Joel', 'McHale', 'excels', 'Lori', 'horny', 'boss', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'excellent', 'hilarious', 'narration', 'heart', 'soul', 'here', 'trio', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'proving', 'finally', 'comedic', 'been', 'trying', 'convince', 'Mila', 'Kunis', 'matching', 'step', 'step', 'true', 'star', 'director/writer/producer', 'Seth', 'MacFarlane', 'who', 'Ted', 'perfection', 'bear', 'truly', 'alive', 'kudos', 'CG', 'team', 'making', 'such', 'realistic', 'animated', 'star', 'However', 'MacFarlane', 'vocal', 'screen', 'presence', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'fallen', 'flat', 'Instead', ""'ve"", 'got', 'raunchy', 'laugh-fest', 'Granted', 'not', 'everyone', 'teddy', 'bears', 'making', 'love', 'produce', ""n't"", 'thing', 'may', 'want', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'FAMILY', 'GUY', 'fans', 'people', 'who', 'enjoy', 'comedy', 'not', 'quite', 'so', 'high-brow', 'TED', 'must-see']",N/A

1478777,AJ63Q41MSXHBB,B005LAII12,Dan the monster movie fan,"[1, 4]","As I said Ted is a piece, a beautiful piece, a beautiful piece of grimy, slimy, trash, that has the lowest form of ""comedy"". I admit I liked the first 3 seasons of Family Guy but after that in my opinion, it just went down hill. I still enjoy American Dad though, it actually has some intelligence put into it. As for The Cleveland Show it isn't very good but at least Cleveland is likeable unlike Peter Griffin. First off I want to say MacFarlane can be funny and can put forth intelligence into his comedic talents, however he mostly just uses the easiest way to make the casual TV watcher or movie goer to laugh he uses toilet humor, pop-culture references which is fine sometimes but not all of the time. I respect Seth but not some of his work. With that lets go head first into this thing.The Plot: A middle aged man lives with his stuffed bear named Ted. A foul-mouthed annoyance through out the picture. Ted was brought to life by John when he was a young boy through a wish. I'm sorry but the cgi just looks blah it is just unappealing. Together they party, tell sex jokes, do drugs, and watch the 1980 motion picture based on the comics, Flash Gordon (a film that I enjoy and is actually well made).The movie consists of annoying characters and unfunny jokes. Here's a sample of the humor: John walks in on Ted who's surrounded by hookers and one of them as a joke has left waste on the floor and they discuss who's going to clean it up. Really, is fecal waste meant to be funny, I'm not even 20 years old and I find that unfunny. As usual the film pushes the limits of being offensive to most viewers. The film is very predictable and very well stupid.Most comedies now just try to be so shocking, offensive, and try to push the limits as far as they can. The last comedy that I saw that made me laugh a bit was The Hangover which I'm not gonna praise as I thought it was just okay.I'm glad I only rented this. We all have our own tastes and we all have our own sense of  humor. I personally love Dr.Strangelove and other such comedies like Young Frankenstein oh and Rocky Horror Picture Show. If you like this film fine it's your right to do so you still have my respect. I rate Ted a 1 out of 5. The acting was good but Teds Peter-like voice gets annoying, the writing came off as half-a**ed, the jokes don't work (for me), and the film as a comedy and motion picture just falls flat. I was hoping Ted would get ripped apart in a lawnmower *sigh*. The jokes to me were not offensive but to others may just be offensive. I just want to ask, how did we go from Charlie Chaplin & Abbott & Costello comedy films to films of this lowest form of comedy. By the way that Three Stooges new movie sucked. I'll be sticking with the actual Stooges which re-runs are being shown right now so I'm done here.",1,If you liked this piece (yeah it's a piece alright) then don't read my review!,1372118400,"06 25, 2013",2013,2807,"['said', 'Ted', 'piece', 'beautiful', 'piece', 'beautiful', 'piece', 'grimy', 'slimy', 'trash', 'lowest', 'form', 'comedy', 'admit', 'liked', 'first', '3', 'seasons', 'Family', 'Guy', 'opinion', 'just', 'went', 'down', 'hill', 'still', 'enjoy', 'American', 'Dad', 'actually', 'intelligence', 'put', 'Cleveland', 'Show', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'least', 'Cleveland', 'likeable', 'Peter', 'Griffin', 'First', 'want', 'say', 'MacFarlane', 'can', 'be', 'funny', 'can', 'put', 'forth', 'intelligence', 'comedic', 'talents', 'however', 'mostly', 'just', 'easiest', 'way', 'make', 'casual', 'TV', 'watcher', 'movie', 'goer', 'toilet', 'humor', 'pop-culture', 'references', 'fine', 'sometimes', 'not', 'time', 'respect', 'Seth', 'not', 'work', 'lets', 'go', 'head', 'first', 'thing.The', 'Plot', 'middle', 'aged', 'man', 'stuffed', 'bear', 'named', 'Ted', 'foul-mouthed', 'annoyance', 'picture', 'Ted', 'was', 'brought', 'life', 'John', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'boy', 'wish', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'cgi', 'just', 'blah', 'just', 'unappealing', 'Together', 'party', 'tell', 'sex', 'jokes', 'do', 'drugs', 'watch', '1980', 'motion', 'picture', 'based', 'comics', 'Flash', 'Gordon', 'film', 'enjoy', 'actually', 'well', 'made', '.The', 'movie', 'annoying', 'characters', 'unfunny', 'jokes', 'Here', 'sample', 'humor', 'John', 'walks', 'Ted', 'who', 'surrounded', 'hookers', 'one', 'joke', 'left', 'waste', 'floor', 'discuss', 'who', 'going', 'clean', 'up', 'Really', 'fecal', 'waste', 'meant', 'be', 'funny', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', '20', 'years', 'old', 'find', 'unfunny', 'usual', 'film', 'limits', 'being', 'offensive', 'most', 'viewers', 'film', 'very', 'predictable', 'very', 'well', 'stupid.Most', 'comedies', 'now', 'just', 'try', 'be', 'so', 'shocking', 'offensive', 'try', 'push', 'limits', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'last', 'comedy', 'saw', 'made', 'bit', 'was', 'Hangover', ""'m"", 'not', 'gon', 'na', 'praise', 'thought', 'was', 'just', 'okay.I', ""'m"", 'glad', 'only', 'rented', 'have', 'own', 'tastes', 'have', 'own', 'sense', 'humor', 'personally', 'love', 'Dr.Strangelove', 'other', 'such', 'comedies', 'Young', 'Frankenstein', 'oh', 'Rocky', 'Horror', 'Picture', 'Show', 'like', 'film', 'right', 'do', 'so', 'still', 'have', 'respect', 'rate', 'Ted', '1', '5', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'Teds', 'Peter-like', 'voice', 'annoying', 'writing', 'came', 'off', 'half-a**ed', 'jokes', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'film', 'comedy', 'motion', 'picture', 'just', 'flat', 'was', 'hoping', 'Ted', 'would', 'get', 'ripped', 'apart', 'lawnmower', '*sigh*', 'jokes', 'were', 'not', 'offensive', 'others', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'offensive', 'just', 'want', 'ask', 'how', 'did', 'go', 'Charlie', 'Chaplin', 'Abbott', 'Costello', 'comedy', 'films', 'films', 'lowest', 'form', 'comedy', 'way', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'new', 'movie', 'sucked', ""'ll"", 'be', 'sticking', 'actual', 'Stooges', 're-runs', 'are', 'being', 'shown', 'right', 'now', 'so', ""'m"", 'done', 'here']",N/A

I'm three years older than Seth so we pretty much grew up with the same pop culture references, including a love for things like Star Wars, Star Trek and the 1980 movie Flash Gordon starring Sam Jones, who plays a prominent role here in Ted.  I can tell you right up front if you don't like Family Guy and that type of humor you can probably skip the rest of this review and the movie because you're probably not going to like them either.Ted is a pretty simple story of a young boy named John Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) who doesn't have many friends that wishes his teddy bear could come to life and be his life long companion and through the magic of some excellent computer generated graphics that is exactly what happens.  I thought the way they handled the bear coming to life was perfect, it wasn't transformed into a living and breathing bear with flesh, bones and blood, Ted remained the same furry toy stuffed with plush stuffing but he had the ability to talk, walk, eat and drink.There are a couple of story lines going on here, the main one is that John's girlfriend Lori, played by Mila Kunis, believes that it's time for John to give up his friendship with the bear and ""grow up"" to focus on their relationship.  There's no question that the things Ted and John do together prompted Lori's concern, but it is not because Ted is a stuffed bear as much as it is that Ted is a foul mouthed, weed smoking, alcohol swilling guy without a job.  I think that was a big part of what made this movie work, after a while you started looking at Ted less as a stuffed bear and more just as a living, breathing character.Those that want to dismiss this movie as simply a bunch of crude fart jokes are really not telling you the full story.  Sure, some of that humor exist here, this IS Seth MacFarlane after all, but this movie has a lot of heart.  I mean come on, how can the relationship of a guy and his teddy bear not have at least a little bit of heart?I have to admit I really dug seeing Sam Jones (aka Flash Gordon) in the movie.  He plays an amped up and a bit crazy persona of himself that was just a lot of fun to watch.  If you didn't grow up in the 80's and you weren't a fan of Flash Gordon your mileage may vary here, but I thought it was a blast to see Jones back on the big screen with the Flash character in tow.Overall, if you like Family Guy you'll probably like this movie.  If you like Family Guy AND you had a particular stuffed toy in your childhood that you had an attachment to you're probably going to LOVE this movie as long as you don't mind your childhood plush friend dry humping a cashier in the back of a grocery store.

Add Seth MacFarlane to the list because ""Ted"" is side-splittingly funny.  I was skeptical about the premise of a foul-mouthed beer-swilling pot-smoking plush toy but MacFarlane navigates the concept brilliantly.  He leavens the humor with just the right amount of poignancy to give the film resonance.  Aside from his directorial-writer duties MacFarlane gives voice to Ted and deserves kudos for humanizing the CGI image.  Mark Wahlberg deserves props too because it couldn't have been easy playing against what was probably a blank canvass.  I really like how MacFarlane injects pop culture trivia into the proceedings.  His running gags about Sam Jones(Flash Gordon) and Tom Skerritt are a hoot.

I liked all the pop cultural references as well as the appearance of Sam Jones, from 1980's Flash Gordon, (which I saw in the theater twice in one day!)McFarlane knows his stuff.Much of it's success I believe comes from the fact it was released a week or two after Prometheus, but due to bad word of mouth, Prometheus suffered a 70% drop in ticket sales in it's second week.

I was pleasantly surprise that his style he has taken up with Family Guy in recent seasons did not spill over to this movie.  In Family Guy, his liberal views have become vicious and hate filled towards conservatives, religion and generally anybody who doesn't agree with his liberal and political views.

1478831,A3HM5G9IV1FTFP,B005LAII12,Douglas King,"[0, 0]","American Hollywood comedies have for a while been obsessed with the archetype of the American man-child. I'm not sure which film first started the trend, but Adam Sandler and Judd Apatow have certainly championed it. In so many recent Hollywood comedies, the main character has been a grown man, in his twenties or thirties, who seems to be stuck in perpetual adolescence. The characters are usually smart and witty but lazy and underachieving, have a penchant for drinking or smoking weed and a juvenile sense of humor, but yet - underneath it all - a heart of gold. Despite a wild premise, ""Ted"" is, at its core, another film in the pantheon of comedies featuring the archetype of the American man-child.John (Mark Wahlberg) starts the film as a lonely little boy who makes a wish that his teddy bear will come to life and be his best friend forever. His wish is granted, and ""Ted"" not only turns from stuffed animal to sentient being, but also becomes an international celebrity. The film then flashes forward 25 or so years later, when John is now a 35 year old rental car service employee who still lives with his sentient teddy bear, whose novelty fame wore off years ago. Only now, the two both speak in adult Boston accents, and enjoy sitting around getting high, watching ""Flash Gordon"" and making scatological jokes.This would all be well and good if not for Lori (Mila Kunis), John's girlfriend. Like most films featuring the American man-child, the man-child has somehow managed to attract a beautiful, smart, poised and successful woman. So although Lori loves John, after several years together she begins growing tired of having to share her boyfriend with his crass, pot-smoking teddy bear, and begins wanting a more mature relationship. And so it begins - will John be able to move on from his adolescent inertia in order to hold onto his girl?For the record - this film is very funny. I laughed out loud many times. But underneath the original premise, outrageous humor and overall weirdness that the film often employs, the story of the man-child whose too-perfect girlfriend forces him to finally grow up is incredibly played out.",3,The archetype of the American man-child,1355961600,"12 20, 2012",2012,2150,"['American', 'Hollywood', 'comedies', 'have', 'while', 'been', 'obsessed', 'archetype', 'American', 'man-child', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'film', 'first', 'started', 'trend', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'have', 'certainly', 'championed', 'so', 'many', 'recent', 'Hollywood', 'comedies', 'main', 'character', 'been', 'grown', 'man', 'twenties', 'thirties', 'who', 'be', 'stuck', 'perpetual', 'adolescence', 'characters', 'are', 'usually', 'smart', 'witty', 'lazy', 'underachieving', 'have', 'penchant', 'drinking', 'smoking', 'weed', 'juvenile', 'sense', 'humor', 'yet', 'underneath', 'heart', 'gold', 'wild', 'premise', 'Ted', 'core', 'film', 'pantheon', 'comedies', 'featuring', 'archetype', 'American', 'man-child.John', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'film', 'lonely', 'little', 'boy', 'who', 'wish', 'teddy', 'bear', 'will', 'come', 'life', 'be', 'best', 'friend', 'forever', 'wish', 'granted', 'Ted', 'not', 'only', 'stuffed', 'animal', 'sentient', 'being', 'also', 'international', 'celebrity', 'film', 'then', 'forward', '25', 'so', 'years', 'later', 'when', 'John', 'now', '35', 'year', 'old', 'rental', 'car', 'service', 'employee', 'who', 'still', 'sentient', 'teddy', 'bear', 'novelty', 'fame', 'wore', 'off', 'years', 'ago', 'Only', 'now', 'two', 'speak', 'adult', 'Boston', 'accents', 'enjoy', 'sitting', 'getting', 'high', 'watching', 'Flash', 'Gordon', 'making', 'scatological', 'jokes.This', 'would', 'all', 'be', 'well', 'good', 'not', 'Lori', 'Mila', 'Kunis', 'John', 'girlfriend', 'most', 'films', 'featuring', 'American', 'man-child', 'man-child', 'somehow', 'managed', 'attract', 'beautiful', 'smart', 'poised', 'successful', 'woman', 'Lori', 'John', 'several', 'years', 'together', 'growing', 'tired', 'having', 'share', 'boyfriend', 'crass', 'pot-smoking', 'teddy', 'bear', 'wanting', 'more', 'mature', 'relationship', 'will', 'John', 'be', 'able', 'move', 'adolescent', 'inertia', 'order', 'hold', 'girl', 'record', 'film', 'very', 'funny', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'many', 'times', 'original', 'premise', 'outrageous', 'humor', 'overall', 'weirdness', 'film', 'often', 'story', 'man-child', 'too-perfect', 'girlfriend', 'forces', 'finally', 'grow', 'up', 'incredibly', 'played', 'out']",N/A

Unfortunately the director takes us to repeated dope smoking, hookers hanging out with Ted, Wahlberg as another mid-30s ""failure to launch"" male loser, etc.  Ain't it cool to hang out with your buddy and smoke dope and then show up late for your dead-end job where it takes very little aside from punctuality to be successful.

Unfortunately, the creators of Ted pretty much turned their brains off after coming up with this concept. Rather than trying to write witty or actually funny humor, Ted falls back on a stream of vulgar scenes. The teddy bear, Ted, can't go a single scene without a curse word or talking about sex. I don't mind some R- or X-rated material in comedies, but too many comedies nowadays seem to think comedy is just a string of vulgarity.Like many things, vulgarity in comedy works so long as it's witty or original. Too often Ted beats you over the head with the vulgarity. For example, the idea of Ted wanting to bed a hot blond is funny. Seeing him squirt lotion on his face to imitate ejaculate is just disturbing. The movie could have been a lot better if it had dialed back a bit and gotten better writers.That said, the CGI used to create Ted is absolutely convincing.

It's like an afterschool special from the 80s, but without all the political correctness you'd come to expect from those shows.This is like if you took one of your favorite teddy bears as a kid but saw him grow up to be as a party animal.Every joke hits the mark here including jabs at Seth's own creation ""Family Guy"". I have a lot of favorite scenes in the movie including the ""Teddy Ruxpin"" fight scene.There's a couple of nice dramatic moments too , but it's mostly a raunchy comedy with over the top gags and punchlines.I enjoyed it a lot, and the appearance of Sam Jones having fun with his Flash Gordon persona was definitely a sight to see.Mark Wahlberg does a pretty good job as grownup John Bennett who has to make a decision about whether to cut out his best friend.

1478934,A55RQ26WDPSM0,B005LAII12,Iusedtobeacat,"[6, 20]","Some Reviews Listed Ted as one of the funniest movies that's ever been produced in a long time. How true that statement is? It all comes down to your sense of humor I guess. Humor is subjective much like everything else but it does have some universal rules that gives it an objective view. So, if the masses thought that a specific film is funny then it should be. Unfortunately that wasn't the case with Ted or at least from my experience.I won't come here and say somethings like: ""this is the most terrible movie that I've ever seen, Just stay away from it.Oh My, the amount of racist, sexual inappropriate jokes is a turn off and everyone be as far as possible from this indecent and corrupted piece of disgusting photography that has a general outline also called as a movie for moral's sake and good old PG films""Actually the sense of humor unlike many others who didn't enjoy this film is probably not the main reason I didn't like it. I'm used to Family Guy I won't say it's the best show on earth because I personally don't find it hilarious but it's watchable and sometimes though rarely funny. The so called Shocking content wasn't also why I give this film a 2 star I'm not a Prude by any means! Actually the more shocking and inappropriate the better. The Cast was good, the premise has been done before but not in a R rated form so that was kinda new. So What went wrong? I don't know I just think this movie is somehow lacking.I personally was hoping to laugh like there's no tomorrow, however that didn't happen some jokes were funny but the majority of the film wasn't which is somehow skipping the point of this story, I mean it is supposed to entertain and humor you through out right? versus a couple of scenes.It was really hard to feel sorry or sympathetic for Ted *the main character* because he wasn't likable at all. Not mainly because he smoke pot and bullsh*t a lot. But because he just wasn't. He was obnoxious, unbearable and totally without an agenda for the future, he was just like a Paris Hilton bear version those people who do nothing all day, and just party all long and then do it all again, while the rest of the population is working their heads off for financial security. How can anyone like these people seriously?I think the character of Ted is quite two dimensional which is bad, because it had the opportunity to be much more. It could've at least had some redeeming qualities like a bear wisdom for example? So, yeah wasted potential.All in all, this movie tries so hard to be different from your average Rom/Com, mainly because it's R rated and it's about a teddy bear who can not only speak but smoke pot, drink bud lights, party, mess around, have random sex and date hookers. But that's about as different as it's going to get from a Rom/Com. A more intelligent sense of humor and witty dialogue would've really helped this movie stand out but the writing was totally ignored I guess. Because who wouldn't wanna watch an R rated movie of a Bear named Ted? It's like the producers said Oh, the premise alone should attracted audiences and makes it a good movie so why bother with anything else.I can only imagine Ted appealing to a more younger audience, an audience of 13-16 year olds and occasionally men. Because the sense of humor is don't ask why funny for that age category for some reason. Mainly because those kids believe that the likes of Family Guy will make them look cool, Hey I'm watching a potty filled humor tv show that my parents will kill me if they ever find out. I know everything about sex references and racist jokes now and they think am all innocent and sweet how special am I! I can visualize two 14 years old stealing this movie after it came out on dvd and their parents were watching it with a couple of adult friends while on weekend get together spent drinking beer, and just laughing their heads off at every single boring joke this film has to offer.I've outgrown this sense of humor, really it's no longer funny or shocking.

One trend that I tended to notice that all of the fans of this movie tended to be druggies and shall I say, crude, ""lower-class"" people with extremely bad taste in entertainment and low IQ's. That not withstanding, I decided to rent the movie. I was indifferent to it, but it was ridiculous. There was little in the way of a narrative. The plot came across as stupid and juvenile. Wow, look, they're smoking pot, wow! Halfway through, the movie just seemed self-indulgent and was going nowhere. I turned off.Then I watched the Oscars last night. Turns out the same guy behind Ted was hosting the show. He was just the most evil, horrible, crude person that I've ever seen in my life. He reminds me of many ignorant Midwesterners and Southerners that I've met in my life. He claims that he was just making jokes, but man, many of them were downright racist and mean. The one about not understanding foreigners? Yup, heard that crap a lot. The John Wilkes Booth joke is also the kind of warped, low-class humor that you will hear many Middle America dullards make. These are the same people that couldn't find Canada on a map.Seth has made my blacklist, along with Judd Apatow. He is a no-talent hack that needs to disappear.

Move ahead 20 years and Wahlberg is grown with a grown teddy bear living with him. Ted cusses , drinks beer, and is quite the ladies man. It boils down to Wahlberg having to decide between his new girlfriend or his best friend, the crude and rude party boy teddy bear,Ted.Not to spoil this, but it all works out for them both in the end.This movie is quite hilarious at times, but it definitely is not for kids. There is a large amount of profanity, from Ted of course, and some scenes that are not kid friendly.This reminds me of the eighties film, Howard the Duck, in some ways, but it is a whole lot funnier.

The movie stars Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis but the real star here is a talking teddy bear named Ted. Foul-mouthed and with a filthy mind, this soft toy come to life isn't a companion you would want around your kids. Yet, MacFarlane has given him such a cuddly, adorable physique you can't help but fall madly in love with him. Fans of Stewie in 'Family Guy' will know what I mean. The script is fairly simple. A lonely kid without friends wishes for his teddy bear to come to life and gets exactly what he wanted. The problem starts when he becomes an adult (played by Wahlberg) as his over-dependence on the friendship with Ted is viewed as unusual, especially by his girlfriend (Kunis) who feels sidestepped.

And please, ignore the 'Hard-R' movies of the 90's."" The first American Pie film is a modern classic but it spawned a slew of crappy copy-cats. Try one of those basic cable classic-movie channels.

Wahlberg and Mila Kunis must be singled out for special praise as well, as they respond to the outrageous bear as though he is as real as rain.  They sell the effect.And indeed, as voiced and motion-captured by the director and writer Seth McFarlane, Ted is an entirely credible and show-stealing performer in every shot and scene.Further kudos go to Giovanni Ribisi as a nutty father who is determined to bearnap Ted for his Puggsley-like son to play with and deliver painful ""ouches"" to.At any rate, if you want to see a very different kind of bromance movie, you should definitely check out this R-rated bear.

He was great in The Departed (2006), The Fighter (2010), Shooter (2007) and Contraband (2012). I even liked him in what he calls his favorite role Max Payne (2008).I've had a distant admiration for him since he battled back against a rough start. By the age of 13 he was addicted to cocaine and got in trouble with the Boston Police Department some 25 times.""Everything I did wrong was my own fault. I was taught the difference between right and wrong at an early age. I take full responsibility,"" he said. Even though he likes to forget it, I even dug  Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch.  ""Good Vibrations"" went to #1 in 1991.So when I heard Mark decided to make Ted I was in. He said he didn't want his kids thinking he was a ""bad dude"" or ""scary person"" because of the roles he usually plays. But Mark I'd take violence over a filthy mouthed Teddy bear any day.This could have been, should have been a truly wonderful family film. A small reclusive boy wishes one night his Teddy bear could really talk. The next morning the bear talks, walks and shares his opinions. They even go to a cool spot that ""talking critters"" usually don't go. Everyone can hear him not just the boy. He ends up on Johnny Carson but in the long run everyone gets used to the idea that the stuffed animal talks.But instead of being family friendly, the bear smokes dope, chases woman and has a filther mouth than a sailor.",3,Ted has its moments but is definitely not family friendly,1355356800,"12 13, 2012",2012,1519,"['Jim', 'Clark', 'publisher', 'Lee', 'County', 'Courier', 'Tupelo', 'MississippiI', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'almost', 'movie', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'been', 'was', 'great', 'Departed', '2006', 'Fighter', '2010', 'Shooter', '2007', 'Contraband', '2012', 'even', 'liked', 'what', 'favorite', 'role', 'Max', 'Payne', '2008', '.I', ""'ve"", 'had', 'distant', 'admiration', 'battled', 'back', 'rough', 'start', 'age', '13', 'was', 'addicted', 'cocaine', 'got', 'trouble', 'Boston', 'Police', 'Department', '25', 'times', 'Everything', 'did', 'wrong', 'was', 'own', 'fault', 'was', 'taught', 'difference', 'right', 'wrong', 'early', 'age', 'take', 'full', 'responsibility', 'said', 'Even', 'forget', 'even', 'dug', 'Marky', 'Mark', 'Funky', 'Bunch', 'Good', 'Vibrations', 'went', '1', '1991.So', 'when', 'heard', 'Mark', 'decided', 'make', 'Ted', 'was', 'said', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'kids', 'thinking', 'was', 'bad', 'dude', 'scary', 'person', 'roles', 'usually', 'Mark', ""'d"", 'take', 'violence', 'filthy', 'mouthed', 'Teddy', 'day.This', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'truly', 'wonderful', 'family', 'film', 'small', 'reclusive', 'boy', 'one', 'night', 'Teddy', 'bear', 'could', 'really', 'talk', 'next', 'morning', 'bear', 'talks', 'walks', 'shares', 'opinions', 'even', 'go', 'cool', 'spot', 'talking', 'critters', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'Everyone', 'can', 'hear', 'not', 'just', 'boy', 'up', 'Johnny', 'Carson', 'long', 'run', 'everyone', 'used', 'idea', 'stuffed', 'animal', 'talks.But', 'instead', 'being', 'family', 'friendly', 'bear', 'dope', 'woman', 'filther', 'mouth', 'sailor']",N/A

What we get is a raunchy laugh-out-loud comedy with a pinch of innocence.First, when I use the word ""innocence"", I mean it has heart in its story; its a story about a man that struggles to grow-up after experiencing true friendship. I also mean: the comedy in this film is very balanced, as in, most jokes are dirty and raunchy while others are, for lack of a better word, innocent. The intro immediately comes to mind when Ted is first introduced as a character and John's father screams for his gun and the police, and Ted softly replies ""Is it a hugging gun?"". Aside from the major jokes shown in the trailers, some of these small lines really made me laugh or smirk. Don't get me wrong though, this is still an adult comedy. Also, it's packed with references from Flash Gordon, to the ringtones, and overall soundtrack; I loved this because it does it right. The acting was great, as well; Mark Whalberg, Mila Kunis, and Seth MacFarlane have great chemistry. Also, there are plenty of familiar faces and voices if you're a fan of Family Guy or American Dad. I knocked one point off because it was a bit predictable story-wise, and a little on the long side, but they weren't really significant problems.Overall, I really enjoyed Ted, it was consistently funny with balanced jokes, so it didn't rely heavily on one type. Don't expect some type of mature or ""sophisticated"" comedy and you should be fine.

1479034,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B005LAII12,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[4, 7]","Ted is the cinematic debut of Seth MacFarlane, a polarizing figure if ever there was one. Obviously he's the creator of the highly successful Family Guy and American Dad, but he's often criticized for being unoriginal and derivative. Ted comes pre-packaged with a particular demographic, all of whom seemed to attend the screening I saw. I don't mean to stereotype, but I'm not sure anyone in that theater was not texting. Regardless, those who criticize MacFarlane have to give him credit for Ted. His first film is a big budget comedy about a man's relationship with a talking teddy bear. It's an interesting premise at face value. What's surprising is that Ted is essentially a formulaic romantic comedy that happens to have a talking, pothead teddy bear in it. This is a criticism, but Ted has received positive reviews and that's for a reason; when it's funny, it's very funny.It's 1985 in Massachusetts and young John Bennett is the most un-popular kid in the neighborhood. For Christmas, he's given a teddy bear and it becomes his best friend. One night he wishes for the teddy bear to come to life and it does. With one newscaster proclaiming ""look what Jesus did! Look what Jesus did!"" Ted becomes an overnight celebrity, even appearing on Johnny Carson. But, ""like Corey Feldman, Frankie Muniz, and Justin Bieber"" the narrator (Patrick Stewart) informs us, ""people eventually stop giving a s***."" Cut to present day, John (Mark Wahlberg) and Ted (voiced and motion-captured by MacFarlane) live together, spending a good amount of time smoking pot and watching the movie Flash Gordon. John is in a committed relationship with Lori (Mila Kunis), whose patience with John and Ted's friendship is wearing thin. She finally convinces John to make Ted move out when they come home to find Ted in the company of four prostitutes; one of whom has left something on the floor.Yes, toilet humor abounds in Ted but this should come as no surprise if you're at all familiar with MacFarlane's work. The film is written by MacFarlane, Alec Sulkin, and Wellesley Wild, all of whom have written for Family Guy. All three have upped the ante on the humor, knowing that this would be a theatrical film and the jokes need to be funnier and more memorable; however, don't expect the humor to differ much from that formula. If MacFarlane's TV work has worn out its welcome for you, don't assume you'll dislike Ted. Just be aware that the humor shares the same DNA and has its share of cut-aways and random, anti-PC dialogue.Ted, while imperfect and with its fair share of jokes that fail to gel, is consistently funny and may be the funniest film I've seen this year. It scores big laughs immediately and the humor never runs out of steam. The humor often comes from pop culture references, cameos, and offensive insults, but there is some comedic gold here and few minutes pass without another big laugh. It's vulgar and provocative, but the really good jokes will make you short of breath.It's easy to forget or overlook, but this film relies heavily on visual effects. Ted is in nearly every scene and the motion-capture here is wonderful. If Ted ages poorly it will not result from the visual effects, which really give off the impression that a stuffed teddy bear has come to life. Why is Seth MacFarlane, a first time director whose previous successes have solely been animated television shows, able to make a film with better special effects than a guaranteed blockbuster like Twilight? And not only does Ted look great, but he's a fully developed character that MacFarlane brings to life both physically and vocally. The film acknowledges that Ted's voice isn't a far cry from Peter Griffin's voice, but he's a fully-realized, unique character.The performances are fine. Wahlberg has proven to be a gifted comedic actor and he's effective here, however the film seems unaware of something pivotal. The friendship angle of John and Ted is much more fascinating than the romantic angle of John and Lori. The film is consistently funny, but the storytelling lacks this same consistency. Aside from the presence of a talking teddy bear, there's little to separate this from any other romantic comedy. Even the music cues are the same (although, with MacFarlane as director, this film's a little heavier on the use of showtunes). Even worse is the unnecessary subplot involving Donny (Giovanni Ribisi), who wants to kidnap Ted for his son. Donny's presence contributes some hilarious moments to the film but the actual kidnapping subplot fails to gain momentum. Had the film shifted its focus to the relationship between Ted and John and been more of a buddy movie, I think it could've been funnier and more engaging.Ted is much better than it has any right to be, but will probably be just as polarizing as its creator for anyone outside of the built-in fanbase. MacFarlane fails to deliver on all the potential this film could've had to offer, but his debut film is uproariously funny at times and boasts a memorable, unique protagonist. Ted is imperfect, but it's a solid debut for MacFarlane that shows a seamless transition from TV to film, animation to live action. Not only would I like to see what else he has to offer, I'd actually be open for a sequel.",4,"Not Perfect, But When It's Funny; It's Very Funny",1343692800,"07 31, 2012",2012,5255,"['Ted',

1479040,ADCC3WHSZNW1R,B005LAII12,J. Richardson,"[0, 2]","Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.Ahhh... Marky Mark. I have to admit that I was originally attracted to this movie because I love when Wahlberg takes a break from his serious movies to loosen up a little bit. Then I saw the first, mature audience, trailer and I wanted to see this because it looked like it was going to be a great movie with or without Wahlberg. Thankfully it was.As most of you already know the film starts with a young John Bennett who is kind of a loner. No one really likes him so he doesn't have any friends. He's kind of the outcast on the street. Well one Christmas he gets a teddy bear which he calls Ted (very original John). Ted winds up being his best friend and then one night he makes a wish that Ted could really talk to him. Then the next morning, as luck would have it, Ted was alive. I'll leave it at that so as not to spoil the movie but fast forward twenty years later and we have the John (Wahlberg) and Ted (MacFarlane) of today. The movie's premise is simple enough. John's being an outcast makes him befriend this teddy bear which makes him unable to become a mature, functioning, member of society. That's where Lori (Kunis) comes in.Even though the main story was a little cliche at times I still found it enjoyable. However there is a side story that I found extremely corny, unenjoyable, and kind of predictable. In short there's a man named Donny (Giovanni Ribisi) who was in love with Ted when he was a little boy, but his parents said there was no way he could have him because there was only one Ted and he belonged to John Bennett. Well Donny has a son named Robert (Aiden Mincks). Donny vowed that he would never let his child down no matter what he wanted and, of course, Robert wants Ted. The entire thing felt forced and it seemed like they were just trying to add something to the story that wasn't entirely necessary.One of the main elements that grabbed me while watching the movie was its pacing. Now there's two different forms of pacing when it comes to comedy films. The comedy and the story. In terms of the story I think it could have been a little better. Sure in the beginning they give you John's back story, but we never see when John started becoming somewhat of a screw up. And why is Donny such a weirdo? A lot of the information just seems kind of thrust at you. In terms of the comedy I think they nailed it. They start out immediately with small things like a kid getting beat up and John comes out to say if he could play with them. Then everyone, even the kid getting beat up, say something along the lines of ""Go home Bennett no one likes you."" Then they work their way up to things like John and Ted doing cocaine with Sam Jones.Overall Score: 8/10 - While I don't agree with the ""Funniest movie of all time"" comment on the back of the box, Ted is still a very enjoyable film. Filled with a lot of laughs and a touching main story that is sure to make you fall in love with not just John and Ted, but Lori as well. I would definitely recommend checking this out if you're looking for an entertaining movie.",4,8/10 - Good,1356220800,"12 23, 2012",2012,3098,"['Note', 'May', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'Proceed', 'caution.Ahhh', 'Marky', 'Mark', 'have', 'admit', 'was', 'originally', 'attracted', 'movie', 'love', 'when', 'Wahlberg', 'break', 'serious', 'movies', 'loosen', 'up', 'little', 'bit', 'Then', 'saw', 'first', 'mature', 'audience', 'trailer', 'wanted', 'see', 'looked', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'great', 'movie', 'Wahlberg', 'Thankfully', 'was.As', 'most', 'already', 'know', 'film', 'young', 'John', 'Bennett', 'who', 'kind', 'loner', 'one', 'really', 'so', ""n't"", 'have', 'friends', 'kind', 'outcast', 'street', 'Well', 'one', 'Christmas', 'teddy', 'bear', 'Ted', 'very', 'original', 'John', 'Ted', 'up', 'being', 'best', 'friend', 'then', 'one', 'night', 'wish', 'Ted', 'could', 'really', 'talk', 'Then', 'next', 'morning', 'luck', 'would', 'have', 'Ted', 'was', 'alive', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'so', 'not', 'spoil', 'movie', 'fast', 'forward', 'twenty', 'years', 'later', 'have', 'John', 'Wahlberg', 'Ted', 'MacFarlane', 'today', 'movie', 'premise', 'simple', 'enough', 'John', 'being', 'outcast', 'befriend', 'teddy', 'bear', 'unable', 'become', 'mature', 'functioning', 'member', 'society', 'where', 'Lori', 'Kunis', 'in.Even', 'main', 'story', 'was', 'little', 'cliche', 'times', 'still', 'found', 'enjoyable', 'However', 'side', 'story', 'found', 'extremely', 'corny', 'unenjoyable', 'kind', 'predictable', 'short', 'man', 'named', 'Donny', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'who', 'was', 'love', 'Ted', 'when', 'was', 'little', 'boy', 'parents', 'said', 'was', 'way', 'could', 'have', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'Ted', 'belonged', 'John', 'Bennett', 'Well', 'Donny', 'son', 'named', 'Robert', 'Aiden', 'Mincks', 'Donny', 'vowed', 'would', 'never', 'let', 'child', 'down', 'matter', 'what', 'wanted', 'course', 'Robert', 'Ted', 'entire', 'thing', 'felt', 'forced', 'seemed', 'were', 'just', 'trying', 'add', 'something', 'story', 'was', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'necessary.One', 'main', 'elements', 'grabbed', 'watching', 'movie', 'was', 'pacing', 'Now', 'two', 'different', 'forms', 'pacing', 'when', 'comedy', 'films', 'comedy', 'story', 'terms', 'story', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'better', 'Sure', 'beginning', 'give', 'John', 'back', 'story', 'never', 'see', 'when', 'John', 'started', 'becoming', 'somewhat', 'screw', 'up', 'why', 'Donny', 'weirdo', 'lot', 'information', 'just', 'kind', 'thrust', 'terms', 'comedy', 'think', 'nailed', 'start', 'out', 'immediately', 'small', 'things', 'kid', 'getting', 'beat', 'up', 'John', 'out', 'say', 'could', 'play', 'Then', 'everyone', 'even', 'kid', 'getting', 'beat', 'up', 'say', 'something', 'lines', 'Go', 'home', 'Bennett', 'one', 'Then', 'work', 'way', 'things', 'John', 'Ted', 'doing', 'cocaine', 'Sam', 'Jones.Overall', 'Score', '8/10', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'Funniest', 'movie', 'time', 'comment', 'back', 'box', 'Ted', 'still', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'Filled', 'lot', 'laughs', 'touching', 'main', 'story', 'sure', 'make', 'fall', 'love', 'not', 'just', 'John', 'Ted', 'Lori', 'as', 'well', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'checking', 'out', ""'re"", 'looking', 'entertaining', 'movie']",N/A

But we're not fond of language that uses homophobia as a weapon. We've seen Seth MacFarlane on talk shows and he seems like a cool guy, who probably doesn't even realize that using words like gay, and homo, as a derogatory IS bigoted and homophobic. Yes, we are well aware that this is how straight boys talk. However, that doesn't make it any less homophobic. I think where we went wrong, was renting this Unrated version. I bet the Regular version cut some of that foul crap out. There's only 4 minutes or so difference between the 2 versions of the film. So you know neither version is all that different from the other; probably they just stuck back in the foul language, which offers nothing to drive the plot forward, and is certainly humorless. Jokes in good fun is one thing; but that's not what was happening here. We're gonna give Seth a pass on this one, and not assume the worst of him. But we're writing this review to answer the 1 specific question that we had when we rented it. Had we seen a review like this, we'd have known NOT to bother, and we did search the reviews for specific words, gay and homophobic. You can see this kind of juvenile crap from a mile away.

It could have gotten far more mawkish than it did, but SM cut it pretty tight and shows a good feel for the big screen. There's cheese but it's usually very self-aware, which makes it quite funny.Some scenes were pointless to me, like the model dumpage, but hey, if something here doesn't offend you then you are well nigh unoffendable, and more power to you!The blu-ray has some nice extras, including a good gag reel and making of, and I like that the effects are used solely to make the bear come to pretty believable life.

1479098,A136MAOWGCU2C2,B005LAII12,K.T. May,"[2, 11]","On an opening weekend that was filled with ""what you see is what you get...and nothing more"" films, Seth MacFarlane's Ted was no exception. That is not to say that it was a bad film. It was more like a 106 minute-long commercial for Boston with the feel of a live-action episode of ""Family Guy"".I found it surprising and slightly disappointing that MacFarlane chose to voice Ted with a Peter Griffin-esque style, as opposed to just being his natural Brian-like self. Mark Wahlberg is fine as the straight man to Ted's obnoxiousness, and Mila Kunis (Lori) is equally fine as Wahlberg's flame, but their performances neither shined nor faltered. They just...were. Joel McHale was a nice surprise as Kunis' sleazy boss who persists as her unwanted suitor, and Patrick Stewart is always a welcome narrator, no matter the genre.The plot, as you may have heard, consists of a boy named John who wishes for his teddy bear to be real so that he can finally have a friend when no one else will grant him that privilege. Naturally, in the style of Big, the teddy bear comes to life because John just happened to make his wish on a night wherein a shooting star occurs. Apparently, shooting stars possess magical powers.The bear shocks everyone (including father Ralph Garman in a bit role) when he walks and talks, prompting the ""honey, go get my gun"" line that naturally follows. Child-like teddy bear, or ""Ted"", then asks if it is a ""hugging gun"". He then proceeds to mature with John throughout the opening credits. Fast-forward to twenty years later and the twosome pass much of their time smoking pot and watching Flash Gordon while commenting on pop culture and modern society. These carefree buds love each other with that irresponsible, frat-boy-brotherhood mentality that has become so prominent in today's culture.The predictable conflict arises when John realizes that he cannot lead a normal adult life until he can hold Lori, the love of his life, in a higher regard than his ""bromance"". He knows that he must separate himself from Ted, but that's difficult to do when they've experienced most of their lives together. Plus, the fun-loving, hooker-acquiring, trash-talking Ted is just too much fun to tell no. After all, he keeps getting bigger and better promotions for acting increasingly worse on the job.The film worked just fine on that conflict alone. It did not need the last-minute subplot in which villain Giovanni Ribisi attempts to kidnap Ted for his spoiled brat son (Aedin Mincks). This seemed like a tacked-on idea and, like many other recent movies, could have shaved off some of its unnecessarily lengthy run-time. However, this sets up the ending of the movie rather well, so it's not entirely for naught.There are enough pop culture references in this film to sink a ship and plenty of pot-shots at celebrities we all love to hate, including Justin Bieber, Taylor Lautner and the widely despised Superman Returns film and its star, Brandon Routh. Ted definitely caters to fans of ""Family Guy"" with its brand of humor, although there were one too many anti-Semitic jokes for my taste. Particularly tired and offensive to some, I'm sure, was an Asian cliche that spiraled down rather rapidly into ridiculousness.One scene near the end was particularly hysterical, though, which led me to believe that they saved their best joke for last. Familiar cameos are sprinkled throughout the movie, so you never know who will turn up and when. Ted is a good one-time watch, but if you're looking to save a few bucks, pick it up as a rental. It doesn't need to be seen on the big screen to be enjoyed.",3,"Seth MacFarlane's ""Ted"" neither wowed nor disappointed.",1341273600,"07 3, 2012",2012,3610,"['opening', 'weekend', 'was', 'filled', 'what', 'see', 'what', 'get', 'nothing', 'more', 'films', 'Seth', 'MacFarlane', 'Ted', 'was', 'exception', 'not', 'say', 'was', 'bad', 'film', 'was', 'more', '106', 'minute-long', 'commercial', 'Boston', 'feel', 'live-action', 'episode', 'Family', 'Guy', '.I', 'found', 'surprising', 'slightly', 'disappointing', 'MacFarlane', 'chose', 'voice', 'Ted', 'Peter', 'Griffin-esque', 'style', 'opposed', 'just', 'being', 'natural', 'Brian-like', 'self', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'fine', 'straight', 'man', 'Ted', 'obnoxiousness', 'Mila', 'Kunis', 'Lori', 'equally', 'fine', 'Wahlberg', 'flame', 'performances', 'shined', 'faltered', 'just', 'were', 'Joel', 'McHale', 'was', 'nice', 'surprise', 'Kunis', 'sleazy', 'boss', 'who', 'unwanted', 'suitor', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'always', 'welcome', 'narrator', 'matter', 'genre.The', 'plot', 'may', 'have', 'heard', 'consists', 'boy', 'named', 'John', 'who', 'teddy', 'bear', 'be', 'real', 'so', 'can', 'finally', 'have', 'friend', 'when', 'one', 'else', 'will', 'grant', 'privilege', 'Naturally', 'style', 'Big', 'teddy', 'bear', 'life', 'John', 'just', 'happened', 'make', 'wish', 'night', 'wherein', 'shooting', 'star', 'Apparently', 'shooting', 'stars', 'possess', 'magical', 'powers.The', 'bear', 'shocks', 'everyone', 'including', 'father', 'Ralph', 'Garman', 'bit', 'role', 'when', 'talks', 'prompting', 'honey', 'go', 'get', 'gun', 'line', 'naturally', 'Child-like', 'teddy', 'bear', 'Ted', 'then', 'hugging', 'gun', 'then', 'mature', 'John', 'opening', 'credits', 'Fast-forward', 'twenty', 'years', 'later', 'twosome', 'pass', 'much', 'time', 'smoking', 'pot', 'watching', 'Flash', 'Gordon', 'commenting', 'pop', 'culture', 'modern', 'society', 'carefree', 'buds', 'love', 'other', 'irresponsible', 'frat-boy-brotherhood', 'mentality', 'become', 'so', 'prominent', 'today', 'culture.The', 'predictable', 'conflict', 'arises', 'when', 'John', 'can', 'not', 'lead', 'normal', 'adult', 'life', 'can', 'hold', 'Lori', 'love', 'life', 'higher', 'regard', 'bromance', 'must', 'separate', 'Ted', 'difficult', 'do', 'when', ""'ve"", 'experienced', 'most', 'lives', 'together', 'fun-loving', 'hooker-acquiring', 'trash-talking', 'Ted', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'fun', 'tell', 'getting', 'bigger', 'better', 'promotions', 'acting', 'increasingly', 'worse', 'job.The', 'film', 'worked', 'just', 'fine', 'conflict', 'alone', 'did', 'not', 'need', 'last-minute', 'subplot', 'villain', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'kidnap', 'Ted', 'spoiled', 'brat', 'son', 'Aedin', 'Mincks', 'seemed', 'tacked-on', 'idea', 'many', 'other', 'recent', 'movies', 'could', 'have', 'shaved', 'off', 'unnecessarily', 'lengthy', 'run-time', 'However', 'up', 'ending', 'movie', 'rather', 'well', 'not', 'entirely', 'are', 'enough', 'pop', 'culture', 'references', 'film', 'sink', 'ship', 'plenty', 'pot-shots', 'celebrities', 'love', 'hate', 'including', 'Justin', 'Bieber', 'Taylor', 'Lautner', 'widely', 'despised', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'film', 'star', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'Ted', 'definitely', 'fans', 'Family', 'Guy', 'brand', 'humor', 'were', 'one', 'too', 'many', 'anti-Semitic', 'jokes', 'taste', 'Particularly', 'tired', 'offensive', ""'m"", 'sure', 'was', 'Asian', 'cliche', 'spiraled', 'down', 'rather', 'rapidly', 'ridiculousness.One', 'scene', 'end', 'was', 'particularly', 'hysterical', 'led', 'believe', 'saved', 'best', 'joke', 'last', 'Familiar', 'cameos', 'are', 'sprinkled', 'movie', 'never', 'know', 'who', 'will', 'turn', 'up', 'when', 'Ted', 'good', 'one-time', 'watch', ""'re"", 'looking', 'save', 'few', 'bucks', 'pick', 'up', 'rental', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'seen', 'big', 'screen', 'be', 'enjoyed']",N/A

And it does have its share of that, but I didn't think it was as bad as the Hangover movies in that regard, and it's truly FUNNY, so that makes it worth it for me. What made it especially enjoyable was the performances and the heart at the center of it. The basic theme of a boy whose teddy-bear comes to life is carried off brilliantly, and serves as a great vehicle for the 'it's time for boy to grow into man' theme, which of course has been done to death, and needed an overhaul. Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis are both excellent, and lift it a bit above the standard comedies of this type. Seth MacFarlane as the voice of Ted was hilarious.

Justifiably so - due to the language, sexual innuendos and drug related humor - however - (and also other than this film moving a tiny bit slow in the middle - pace wise) - it was very funny and quite `real' for me. And, surprisingly it had a really big - slightly tear-jerking heart at the end of it all.Writers Alec Sulkin (Family Guy, The Cleveland Show) Wellesley Wild (Family Guy) and Seth McFarlane (Creator of Family Guy, The Cleveland Show) all set out to do one thing in my opinion - make something that is completely a fantasy - seem completely real. They succeeded in a most hysterical way.The story tells the tale that back in 1985, as a young boy, John Bennett played spot-on by Mark Wahlberg (Boogie Nights, The Fighter), who wanted nothing more than for his beloved teddy bear Ted (MacFarlane) to come to life. Incredibly, that wish was granted. But now that John grown up, his boyhood dream has become a nightmare nuisance. The plot has everything going for it -  including the passionate Mila Kunis (Black Swan, That 70's Show) playing his girlfriend convincing him that growing up is part of life and even, Joel McHale (Spider-man, Community) as Mila's overly sexed boss trying to get her to loose Wahlberg as a boyfriend - to even the hysterically psychotic Giovanni Ribisi (Avatar, Saving Private Ryan) who is stalking John and wants that Teddy Bear for himself and his not so normal son!A real fun and nostalgic moment occurs when John and Ted meet their long-term childhood idol, former US Marine turned actor - Sam J. Jones (actually playing himself from the 1979 movie classic Flash Gordon) - who turns up in some drug induced fantasy sequence. The audience was bursting in laughter (and rock group Queen's original music too)!The film has, action, suspense and just a little too much drama in the middle - but the comedy, slapstick style humor and witty dialogue keep you laughing out loud throughout the movie! Even then un-credited, but familiar, voice of Patrick Stewart (Star Trek:TNG, Excalibur), narrates the film at the beginning and end using a few hysterically chosen quips and words himself.A few other cameos include; Patrick Warburton (How I Met Your Mother, Hercules) as Johns workmate, Ryan Reynolds (The Green Lantern, The Proposal) as - you'll have to see it to know this, Tom Skerritt (Tom Gun, Alien) as the many time mentioned `friend' of everyone appparently and singer/songwriter Nora Jones herself (Made in Manhattan, Love Actually) as herself helping John express his love to Mila.Finally I must applaud director Seth McFarlane for doing bolding what he does best, taking a satirical look at real life and commenting on the various things we all think about - but don't say out loud as much as we would like to. From celebrities to religion - nothing is off limits or sacred and almost everything is off-color. But it is fun and funny.The best surprise and unexpectedly, what that by the end of the film - McFarlane pulls yours heart string - and does it very effectively. This film is definitely not for children - but if you enjoy The Family Guy, Simpsons and American Dad type of humor - you'll love this one!

Giovanni Ribisi plays an awesome stalker/creepy guy and Joel McHale turns in a great performance as the lecherous boss.

What you decide will pretty much boil down to your taste in humor but I will add that if you are a fan of ""Family Guy"" you will find at least parts of this comedy engaging.Mark Wahlberg plays a guy named John who wished for a friend of his own as a child and got it in a teddy bear that came to life. It was big news back in the day but not society has cynically accepted it and moved on. Anyway, they're the best of friends but now that Johnny is 35 and with his 4 year old girlfriend (played by Mila Kunis) his teddy bear's hedonistic focuses are cramping Johnny's love life and future.

Of course there are a variety of problems but I don't wish to give spoilers away.Also starring Joel McHale (of ""The Community""), Ryan Reynolds, Tom Skerritt (more of a cameo) and Giovanni Ribisi (as the villain).Yes, that's Nora Jones as herself and yeah that's Patrick Stewart as the narrator.Spoilers below.The budget for this pictures was roughly $60M and contrary to naysayers who felt this picture was horrible they're most likely being ignored as this picture made over $522M at the Box Office.HUMOR: B minus; STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: B minus to B; CINEMATOGRAPHY: B; SOUND/MUSIC: B to B plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B; OVERALL GRADE: B minus to B; WHEN WATCHED: end of January 2013.SPOILER: I liked how this picture didn't do the typical ""your childish lifestlye cannot coexist with our love relationship"" that is common in the diluted Hollywood rom com pics.

In this film, also written by MacFarlane, young John Bennett gets an oversized Teddy bear for Christmas.  John is even less popular than the Jewish kids who are beaten up each year by the Christian kids.  He wishes his Teddy would become human and be his lifelong friend.  Bang!  It happens and the two form a bond.Years later as a 35 year old desk clerk for a car rental agency, John still has kid-like tendencies but for his 4 year relationship with Lori (Mila Kunis).  Lori puts an ultimatum to John.  Rambunctious, profane Ted must get his own apartment or she will move on.  This of course doesn't sit well with Ted who enjoys his pot smoking time with John.  Ted (MacFarlane) enjoys the best lines and while they aren't consistent, some are damn funny.  MacFarlane's humor is fast and he doesn't give you much time to absorb it before moving on to the next joke.  I also suspect many of quick hits will sail over some people's heads.Joel McHale and Giovanni Ribisi are along for the ride as foils for John and Ted.  Sam Jones enlivens a party at Ted's pad.  He of course is from John and Ted's favorite movie ""Flash Gordon"" from 1980.  The bit is funny with some recreated scenes from the film.

It's a decent movie, but since most of the humor comes from shock value alone (remember the humor from Hangover Part II?), you're not going to find yourself putting this in your list of all-time greats.One of the problems this movie has is that Mark Wahlberg isn't a good comedic actor.

As ever, and I seem to do this a lot, those reviewers who moan about the film being ""crass"", ""gross"" ""crude"" etc, read the bloody box before you watch it, because you get exactly what you expect in the Seth McFarlane vehicle, please, please, please, if you dont want to hear rude words watch something more suitable to your sensibilities like ""The Sound of Music"", I mean its like saying ""I bought 'Inglourious Basterds'only to be shocked and offended that the title was spelt incorrectly and contained a profanity that surely the Lord Jesus would not have approved of"". I believe the phrase the young folk would use to describe this dichotomy is ""facepalm"" which probably and more accurately should be two hyphenated words, but who am I to quibble.Please, understand this, Ted is rude and not a childrens film. If you can get past these 2 potential deal breakers, then you should be at a suitable start point to watch the film, sure and safe in the knowledge that you are not going to be surprised. If you have failed the grasp or understand these important paradigms, please replace the dvd back on the shelf and back away slowly, If it has been delivered to your home, place it in a bucket of sand and carefully move it to the bottom of the garden whilst reciting the Lords prayer.

Simple make your main character a Teddy Bear, turn his kids into his slacker friend and his wife into his friend's long suffering girlfriend and Presto, you have Ted.Mark Wahlberg is John Bennett whose teddy bear Peter (sorry Ted) comes to life after a Christmas Wish that is almost as powerful as an Apache Helicopter.  Unfortunately for John his parents apparently had no idea how to raise either him or the teddy bear and both become pot smoking slacker losers in Boston.At first glance the idea that John has a smoking hot successful girlfriend, Mika Kunis makes no sense until you realize that every single other male Character in the movie and frankly almost all the female ones are even more dysfunctional or downright sick compared to him.  In the population of this movie Mark Wahlberg's character IS the pick of the litter.It's pretty much a standard slacker movie, boy promises to do better, girl gives him second chance, boy screws up royally, girl leave him and is perused by evil rich guy, Boy does romantic thing to win girl back and after an action scene on Fenway's Green Monster ends in tragedy boy gets girl.Every thing else is filler, Peter oops Ted is simply a foul mouthed idiot whose antics would not rate laugh without the fur.  Family guy style jokes abound from the flashbacks to the pop culture references.The movie does have moments.  I laughed out loud at Sam Jones scenes, the funniest of the picture, camp in its purest form.  Norah Jones is amusing in a small role and Patrick Stewart makes you laugh as the narrator.Wahlberg and Kunis don't do BAD with the material they have, I actually think they do the best they could with it, its just the material is nothing special.  As for Peter oops Ted, it depends on what you came in expecting.  Those expecting to be outraged won't be because they've seen it all before on the Tube and those expecting to be laughing will if they think about it wonder why they paid money for a live action Family guy movie.However I suspect the slacker, video game, I'm cool because I watch John Stewart, audiences will love it never realizing that the joke is on them.Me, I'd wait for Netflix.",3,The Family Guy live action movie.,1341878400,"07 10, 2012",2012,2319,"['What', 'do', 'do', 'are', 'successful', 'TV', 'show', 'writer', 'who', 'make', 'Movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'brass', 'do', 'what', 'Simpsons', 'folks', 'did', 'do', 'blatantly', 'Simple', 'make', 'main', 'character', 'Teddy', 'Bear', 'turn', 'kids', 'slacker', 'friend', 'wife', 'friend', 'long', 'suffering', 'girlfriend', 'Presto', 'have', 'Ted.Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'John', 'Bennett', 'teddy', 'bear', 'Peter', 'sorry', 'Ted', 'life', 'Christmas', 'Wish', 'almost', 'as', 'powerful', 'Apache', 'Helicopter', 'Unfortunately', 'John', 'parents', 'apparently', 'had', 'idea', 'how', 'raise', 'teddy', 'bear', 'become', 'pot', 'smoking', 'slacker', 'losers', 'Boston.At', 'first', 'glance', 'idea', 'John', 'smoking', 'hot', 'successful', 'girlfriend', 'Mika', 'Kunis', 'sense', 'realize', 'single', 'other', 'male', 'Character', 'movie', 'frankly', 'almost', 'female', 'ones', 'are', 'even', 'more', 'dysfunctional', 'downright', 'sick', 'compared', 'population', 'movie', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'character', 'pick', 'litter.It', 'pretty', 'much', 'standard', 'slacker', 'movie', 'boy', 'promises', 'do', 'better', 'girl', 'second', 'chance', 'boy', 'up', 'royally', 'girl', 'leave', 'perused', 'evil', 'rich', 'guy', 'Boy', 'romantic', 'thing', 'win', 'girl', 'back', 'action', 'scene', 'Fenway', 'Green', 'Monster', 'tragedy', 'boy', 'girl.Every', 'thing', 'else', 'filler', 'Peter', 'oops', 'Ted', 'simply', 'foul', 'mouthed', 'idiot', 'antics', 'would', 'not', 'rate', 'fur', 'Family', 'guy', 'style', 'jokes', 'abound', 'flashbacks', 'pop', 'culture', 'references.The', 'movie', 'have', 'moments', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'Sam', 'Jones', 'scenes', 'funniest', 'picture', 'camp', 'purest', 'form', 'Norah', 'Jones', 'amusing', 'small', 'role', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'narrator.Wahlberg', 'Kunis', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'BAD', 'material', 'have', 'actually', 'think', 'do', 'best', 'could', 'just', 'material', 'nothing', 'special', 'Peter', 'oops', 'Ted', 'what', 'came', 'expecting', 'expecting', 'be', 'outraged', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Tube', 'expecting', 'be', 'laughing', 'will', 'think', 'wonder', 'why', 'paid', 'money', 'live', 'action', 'Family', 'guy', 'movie.However', 'suspect', 'slacker', 'video', 'game', ""'m"", 'cool', 'watch', 'John', 'Stewart', 'audiences', 'will', 'love', 'never', 'realizing', 'joke', 'them.Me', ""'d"", 'wait', 'Netflix']",N/A

The story was very predictable and felt clich&eacute;, your average ""guy must choose between his lazy fun loving best friend and girlfriend who wants him to do something with his life."" The jokes were nothing but Seth doing what he can't do on TV, mainly dropping the F-bomb. And I really felt like it was just a waste of time. The acting was really good though. You really did feel like the actors were actually talking and interacting with Ted.Now before I get comments such as ""it's Seth MacFarlane and an R-rated comedy, what did you expect?"" Truth be told, I didn't know what to expect. Yes I saw the uncensored trailer and know what Family Guy is like, but one also must consider that Seth made the awesomeness that is Johnny Bravo, with the help of Butch Hartman, the entertaining series that is American Dad, and the ok Cleveland Show. I went in knowing it could be great, or bad. What I wasn't expecting was that the ONLY ""jokes"" would be ""I'm a living teddy bear, I curse, drink, like hookers, and it's funny because I'm a child's toy."" Really that's it. One trick pony where the trick gets old really fast. I'm sure Seth could have done something else, maybe develop the stalker character some more and draw humor form the fact that he's stalking a teddy bear, but nope, just the contrast of a teddy bear cursing and getting drunk. Also he's made episodes for his shows that have had some really interesting stories. The episode where Johnny meats Adam West and they go on a ridiculous adventure to rescue Mama, good story with excellent execution that led to very funny situations. During Ted however, I sat there, thinking ""this will happen next...aaand I was right, now he's gonna, yep he just did. Yep, he said f*** again.""Here's a way to tell if you'll enjoy it or not, watch the uncensored trailer on YouTube, and ask yourself ""will I enjoy 90 minutes of just this?""

I appreciate Seth MacFarlane's sense of humor (and his singing voice, check outMusic Is Better Than Words).  He has been willing to gore sacred cows in many walks of life.  MacFarlane's irreverence is refreshing, and likeRobot Chicken: Season Fiveabout 10% of his jokes are pants wettingly funny, 80% are amusing, and 10% just fall flat.  Those are pretty good odds for humor across such a wide front.Unfortunately in the case of Ted, there was about 25% that were just horribly offensive.  I'm no prude and can certainly laugh at myself, my culture, my religion, etc.  &#34;Family Guy&#34; and &#34;American Dad&#34; have their moments, but generally there is only one or two missteps an episode.  In Ted, the level of callousness and crudity were past the line enough to make the film unfunny.  I'm not talking about political correctness.  When Ted tells his manager that he used produce to fornicate with and then sold it to an indigent family, it does not come off as funny.  And, the examples are legion.The other major issue I have is that Ted drew in a fair number of kids.  It is a movie about a talking teddy bear after-all.  I heard a couple of boys that appeared to be between 9-10 talking about Ted on the Metro last week.  Sure, sure, where are the parents, but I could imagine some parents screwing up by letting their very young kids watch a movie about a talking teddy bear.

this idea of a stuffed bear coming to life,would suggest a myriad of comic possibilities.Written,produced and executed with a deft and smart touch,this movie could have been a completely different and far BETTER film.Instead we are given a film populated with the kind of gutter crap that passes for humour these days and it constantly offends ones sensibilities throughout.This film is not a film for anyone under 18 years old but I personally know a father who has shown this to his young teenage boys,and I'm sure there are plenty more out there who think:""guy,talking teddy bear,oh how cute,let's all sit down and watch this"".Believe me,keep this movie as far away from your children as possible.The stuffed bear utters language I would never use,has sex with various women,smokes up constantly and does other disgusting actions I just cannot say in this review.The story starts with an eight year old John Bennett.He's a loner who wishes he had a companion.Voila,Ted comes to life and the two remain inseparable from that point on.John only keeps the secret so long and eventually Ted is introduced to various people and word spreads like wildfire.Ted becomes a celebrity.Fast forward and John is now 35 and he and his bear still co-habitate together.John has a girlfriend but their relationship is rocky at best,all centering around John's relationship with Ted.In order to please his girlfriend he forces Ted out into his own place.Ted,trying NOT to,has gotten a job in a supermarket.This helps John and his girlfriends relationship for a time,but comes a party his girlfriend's boss throws.Ted phones John up saying their on-screen hero actor from the /80s Flash Gordon movie,Sam Jones,is actually there in his apartment.John reluctantly races over just to spend 30 minutes,but 30m turns into over two hours.His girlfriend hits the roof and finally leaves him.At this time a slowly developing side plot enters the picture.A dysfunctional man and his son appear and kidnap Ted.Of course Ted puts out the SOS and John and his girlfriend come racing to the rescue.Ted is ripped apart in the struggle and loses his stuffing which eventually kills him.They race him home,put him together but nothing brings Ted back.Next morning Ted awakens to a startled John.It seems John's girlfriend wished her life back,which brought Ted back.The film ends as John gets married.In cameo's,Ryan Reynolds appears as a gay lover,Norah Jones appears as someone Ted made love to some years back,and Tom Skerritt appears because one of the characters has kidnapped his daughter.Really twisted plot reasons to get good talent to make an appearance in ones movie.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and is clear and crisp.There are two versions here,a theatrical and an extended unrated version.The unrated is even raunchier than the theatrical version.Both are restricted anyways.Extras include a gag reel,a featurette and commentary.All in all a totally disgusting film.This movie,put in the hands of someone who is smart and imaginative,could have made it so very much better than what we have here.Instead we have to settle for what passes for comedy these days,and get almost two hours worth of unfunny and mind numbing college frat humour.If you like continual four letter humour,then this buds for you.Mr.McFarlane, please stick to Family Guy,and

What if this was a friend who was only alive because you wished him to be? What would you do?John Benett was a lonely little boy with no friends living in Brockton, Massachusetts in 1985. Then, on Christmas morning, he received a plush teddy bear he called Ted. One night, lying in bed, John wished Ted would come to life. That wish came true thanks to a star falling from the sky while John was making it. Ted came to life shocking John, his parents, and the world at large. But by 2012, no one cares. John (now played by Mark Wahlberg) is working at a car rental agency and has been dating Lori (played by Mila Kunis) for 4 years. Ted (now voiced by Seth MacFarlane) shares an apartment with Lori and John but makes no contribution to the household expenses, entertains prostitutes in the living room, and rushes into bed with John and Lori during thunderstorms as they still terrify both him and John. Eventually, Lori can't take anymore and tells John that Ted must find a job and a place of his own.Now, I am not a fan of Family Guy and I've never watched any of MacFarlane's other, less popular series. The most popular shows on Fox all seem to follow the same formula. One or two smart characters surrounded by idiots. In Family Guy, the smart characters would be Brian and Stewie. In The Simpsons, the only smart character I can think of is Lisa. That aside, Ted is a hilarious film.

As such, a film like ""Ted"" can now wildly succeed in a contained theater format, and it does (in this case) with hilarious results.For a basic plot summary, ""Ted"" sees young John Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) giving life to his childhood teddy bear (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) via a magical wish one long-ago Christmas night.  Fast-forward about 26 years, however, and suddenly Ted is now a pot-smoking, wise-cracking, babe-chasing celebrity who keeps John from realizing his full potential.  When girlfriend Lori (Mila Kunis) comes into John's life, John must ultimately choose between her and Ted in order to figure out what his future will hold.Quite obviously, this movie is made for the ""Family Guy set"".  I mean, practically ever FG voice makes some kind of appearance here, and the jokes are of the same sort of crude/sexual/celebrity/juvenile nature.  As such, I know a number of individuals who would walk out of the theater in disgust.  For those who ""get it"", though, it is absolutely hilarious.  I don't want to go into any details and ruin the fun of many of the film's best jokes, but suffice it to say that you'll never go more than a couple of minutes with a belly-laugh.Besides the jokes, the acting is also tremendous.  Kunis is fast becoming the ""Queen of the rom-com"" and turns in another great performance here, while Wahlberg is convincing as a sort of ""Peter Pan"" character who is in no hurry to grow up.  MacFarlane's voice of Ted (in which can be heard all of Peter, Brian, & Stewie from FG fame) never gets old either.Also, there is more to ""Ted"" than just comedy.  It contains some impressive action sequences, as well as some character development and drama surpassing that which one would expect in movies that SHOULD showcase those things.  This movie, despite the humor type, takes itself very seriously at its core and strives to provide more than just the laughs that one knows will exist coming in.In essence, ""Ted"" is a sort of ""coming of age"" for Seth McFarlane's unique set of skills.  Whereas he once was thrown off FOX's airwaves for being a little too crude, he can now make a movie about a pot-smoking, expletive-spewing teddy bear that leads its opening weekend at the box office.  Why the switch?  Because, after years of honing his comedic style, MacFarlane found the right mix of actors and tone to produce a movie that stands up well on its own merits.",5,"Legitimizing The ""Family Guy"" Humor Set",1341100800,"07 1, 2012",2012,2610,"['Family', 'Guy', 'TV', 'show', 'been', 'air', 'decade', 'now', 'entire', 'generation', 'comedy', 'fans', 'who', 'have', 'grown', 'up', 'raunchy', 'celebrity-bashing', 'voice-acting', 'frat-party', 'style', 'humor', 'such', 'film', 'Ted', 'can', 'now', 'wildly', 'succeed', 'contained', 'theater', 'format', 'case', 'hilarious', 'results.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'Ted', 'young', 'John', 'Bennett', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'giving', 'life', 'childhood', 'teddy', 'bear', 'voiced', 'Seth', 'MacFarlane', 'magical', 'wish', 'one', 'long-ago', 'Christmas', 'night', 'Fast-forward', '26', 'years', 'however', 'suddenly', 'Ted', 'now', 'pot-smoking', 'wise-cracking', 'babe-chasing', 'celebrity', 'who', 'John', 'realizing', 'full', 'potential', 'When', 'girlfriend', 'Lori', 'Mila', 'Kunis', 'John', 'life', 'John', 'must', 'ultimately', 'choose', 'Ted', 'order', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'future', 'will', 'hold.Quite', 'obviously', 'movie', 'made', 'Family', 'Guy', 'set', 'mean', 'practically', 'ever', 'FG', 'voice', 'kind', 'appearance', 'here', 'jokes', 'are', 'same', 'sort', 'crude/sexual/celebrity/juvenile', 'nature', 'such', 'know', 'number', 'individuals', 'who', 'would', 'walk', 'theater', 'disgust', 'who', 'get', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'go', 'details', 'ruin', 'fun', 'many', 'film', 'best', 'jokes', 'say', ""'ll"", 'never', 'go', 'more', 'couple', 'minutes', 'belly-laugh.Besides', 'jokes', 'acting', 'also', 'tremendous', 'Kunis', 'fast', 'becoming', 'Queen', 'rom-com', 'great', 'performance', 'here', 'Wahlberg', 'convincing', 'sort', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'character', 'who', 'hurry', 'grow', 'up', 'MacFarlane', 'voice', 'Ted', 'can', 'be', 'heard', 'Peter', 'Brian', 'Stewie', 'FG', 'fame', 'never', 'old', 'either.Also', 'more', 'Ted', 'just', 'comedy', 'impressive', 'action', 'sequences', 'as', 'well', 'character', 'development', 'drama', 'surpassing', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'movies', 'SHOULD', 'showcase', 'things', 'movie', 'humor', 'type', 'very', 'seriously', 'core', 'strives', 'provide', 'more', 'just', 'laughs', 'one', 'will', 'exist', 'coming', 'in.In', 'essence', 'Ted', 'sort', 'coming', 'age', 'Seth', 'McFarlane', 'unique', 'set', 'skills', 'once', 'was', 'thrown', 'off', 'FOX', 'airwaves', 'being', 'little', 'too', 'crude', 'can', 'now', 'make', 'movie', 'pot-smoking', 'expletive-spewing', 'teddy', 'bear', 'opening', 'weekend', 'box', 'office', 'Why', 'switch', 'years', 'honing', 'comedic', 'style', 'MacFarlane', 'found', 'right', 'mix', 'actors', 'tone', 'produce', 'movie', 'up', 'well', 'own', 'merits']",N/A

I think Mark Wahlberg is a great actor and the whole story could have been really good and funny. I think ""Invincible"" is one of his best movies. The trailer of the movie is an example of a really good commercial for a mediocre film with too many bad and adult jokes.The story is simple. A boy wishes that his bear could come to life during Christmas, and guess what...it happens! And the boy grows older always living with his teddy bear. The plot is dormant all the way to last 20 minutes. I think that they made the script as they were filming the movie (like the SNL sketches) and realized that they were short and had to add more stuff. It looks like they rushed the end.It is a decent plot with huge potential and good acting. If you like juvenile jokes (like in the American Pie movie) then you will like the movie. However, it is NOT a PG 13 movie (as stated on the cover), and because of the language and the cruel jokes it is rated R. Cannot watch this movie with your kids. I highly doubt that a father can watch the movie with his daughter(s) and wife when in the opening scene the father complements his wife (using the bj word) of the gift she gave him last night (on the eve of Christmas) in front of their son on Christmas day while talking about presents. Really bad and inapropriate humor, for a so called family movie.  In addition, some ""jokes"" are really not funny and really offensive for a parent. I know that people in Hollywood are numb to some things that we parents are sensitive because of their lifestyle, but I was expecting much better from Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis who made some good clean family movies thus far (except Boogie Nights but the whole subject of the movie is porn so...). Totally embarrassing and bad jokes galore, especially in the opening scene. The Hollywood people may have to wake up and make cleaner family movies if they want to make money with the people. Otherwise they should expect to make little income since the movie will be watched in few cities on the East and West coast only.I will do my best to alert people about the content of these so called ""funny"" movies that the liberal pseudoelite in Hollywood tries to perpetrate and make it normal. Even if Amazon buries my review deep inside the 200 something other reviews, people will be able to find it.Two stars only because Mark Wahlberg's good performance and some good clean jokes.",2,Could have been much better!,1355616000,"12 16, 2012",2012,2523,"['really', 'wanted', 'movie', 'be', 'good', 'funny', 'really', 'wanted', 'watch', 'movie', 'family', 'setting', 'Can', 'not', 'do', 'think', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'great', 'actor', 'whole', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'good', 'funny', 'think', 'Invincible', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'trailer', 'movie', 'example', 'really', 'good', 'commercial', 'mediocre', 'film', 'too', 'many', 'bad', 'adult', 'jokes.The', 'story', 'simple', 'boy', 'bear', 'could', 'come', 'life', 'Christmas', 'guess', 'what', 'boy', 'older', 'always', 'living', 'teddy', 'bear', 'plot', 'dormant', 'way', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'think', 'made', 'script', 'were', 'filming', 'movie', 'SNL', 'sketches', 'realized', 'were', 'short', 'had', 'add', 'more', 'stuff', 'rushed', 'end.It', 'decent', 'plot', 'huge', 'potential', 'good', 'acting', 'like', 'juvenile', 'jokes', 'American', 'Pie', 'movie', 'then', 'will', 'like', 'movie', 'However', 'NOT', 'PG', '13', 'movie', 'stated', 'cover', 'language', 'cruel', 'jokes', 'rated', 'R.', 'Can', 'not', 'watch', 'movie', 'kids', 'highly', 'doubt', 'father', 'can', 'watch', 'movie', 'daughter', 's', 'wife', 'when', 'opening', 'scene', 'father', 'wife', 'using', 'bj', 'word', 'gift', 'gave', 'last', 'night', 'eve', 'Christmas', 'front', 'son', 'Christmas', 'day', 'talking', 'presents', 'Really', 'bad', 'inapropriate', 'humor', 'so', 'called', 'family', 'movie', 'addition', 'jokes', 'are', 'really', 'not', 'funny', 'really', 'offensive', 'parent', 'know', 'people', 'Hollywood', 'are', 'numb', 'things', 'parents', 'are', 'sensitive', 'lifestyle', 'was', 'expecting', 'much', 'better', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'Mila', 'Kunis', 'who', 'made', 'good', 'clean', 'family', 'movies', 'thus', 'far', 'Boogie', 'Nights', 'whole', 'subject', 'movie', 'porn', 'so', 'Totally', 'embarrassing', 'bad', 'jokes', 'galore', 'especially', 'opening', 'scene', 'Hollywood', 'people', 'may', 'have', 'wake', 'up', 'make', 'cleaner', 'family', 'movies', 'want', 'make', 'money', 'people', 'should', 'expect', 'make', 'little', 'income', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'watched', 'few', 'cities', 'East', 'West', 'coast', 'only.I', 'will', 'do', 'best', 'alert', 'people', 'content', 'so', 'called', 'funny', 'movies', 'liberal', 'pseudoelite', 'Hollywood', 'tries', 'perpetrate', 'make', 'normal', 'Even', 'Amazon', 'buries', 'review', 'deep', '200', 'something', 'other', 'reviews', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'find', 'it.Two', 'stars', 'only', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'good', 'performance', 'good', 'clean', 'jokes']",N/A

It comes off obnoxious and toilet and teddy's voice was hard to adjust to at first but I ended up just going with it and soon found out I related to the character and the story.  I'm a typical guy and I can't pretend that alot of the humour I can relate to, Sorry!  I'm a pig like most men.  I also like Mila Kunis.  I think she's one of the best new school actresses and she's beautiful.  So I like this movie and the marky mark song Good Vibration.
