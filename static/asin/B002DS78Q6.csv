Some of the material from the first DVD set is touched on again in this set, but only briefly.  The Volume 2 dvd set is more advanced work that is built upon the foundation that was covered in the first volume.The training is exceptionally good in both volumes.If you've ever been to a tactical carbine school, you'll benefit enormously from having these DVD's in your library as a refresher on points you might have forgotten.The Art of the Tactical Carbine Vol 2 is excellent on its own merits even if it's the only volume you purchase.Highly recommended.",5,Exceptional training class DVD,1333670400,"04 6, 2012",2012,626,"['bought', 'follow', 'up', 'first', 'Tactical', 'Carbine', 'release', 'material', 'first', 'DVD', 'set', 'touched', 'again', 'set', 'only', 'briefly', 'Volume', '2', 'dvd', 'set', 'more', 'advanced', 'work', 'built', 'foundation', 'was', 'covered', 'first', 'volume.The', 'training', 'exceptionally', 'good', 'volumes.If', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'been', 'tactical', 'carbine', 'school', ""'ll"", 'benefit', 'enormously', 'having', 'DVD', 'library', 'refresher', 'points', 'might', 'have', 'forgotten.The', 'Art', 'Tactical', 'Carbine', 'Vol', '2', 'excellent', 'own', 'merits', 'even', 'only', 'volume', 'purchase.Highly', 'recommended']",Magpul DYN002 Art Of Tactical
1263990,AN81JUYW2SL24,B002DS78Q6,Gearhead Mania,"[1, 1]","Magpul Art of the Tactical Carbine Volume 2 DVDI opted to skip Volume 1 based on some feedback from other viewers that Volume 1 was too fundamental, but I have since ordered Volume 1. However, I watched Volume 2 through and through and picked up a lot of weapon manipulation skills that made a lot of sense. I've watched Art of the Dynamic Handgun first, and noted that the presentation and instruction was noticeably different. In Dynamic Handgun (1st Edition presumably), there's less humor, Haley and Costa pick on the Marines more often, and the production quality was different. I felt Dynamic Carbine Volume 2 was more professionally edited/filmed versus Dynamic Handgun.In Art of the Dynamic Carbine, an important skill that is being taught will be highlighted by a small graphic that pops up and allows you to jot it down and review it in slow-motion in Disc 3. Haley and Costa make note that Dynamic Carbine is intended to teach weapon manipulation drills and skills, and not tactics. There are lots of drills like urban prone, dynamic prone, buddy skills, one-handed malfunction drills, etc... that may not apply to 95% of shooters that just go to a static range, but are useful to know or apply to LE/military that want to brush up their skills.The first fundamental they covered was proper grip and stance. This is something I never learned properly, because all I could go from was standard military training/field manuals (books), magazines, articles written by Massad Ayoob and photographs of Soldiers engaging enemy targets in theater.Haley and Costa picked on John, the shooter with the 2 point sling, quite often mainly because of his slow tactical reloads. However, it is more gear-related since his mag pouches were of a different design and his sling would require additional time to move around. This goes back to something I have noticed in this course and that is how Magpul Dynamics emphasizes the need for gear or skills that makes you work more efficiently. The reaction hand grip technique seems counterintuitive at first and goes against most military and law enforcement training, but the new Magpul AFG grip requires this type of position. It does appear more stable than a traditional magwell, VFG, or offhand grip as you are trying to mitigate recoil and muzzle movement in a dynamic environment versus tightening your groups.I have noticed that Costa is better at speaking than Haley. Haley often talks too fast, but is still articulate. I can understand both of them clearly, but Costa is more like that Senior NCO that can somehow project his voice for a 5 mile radius.The outakes are funny, but there are many funny moments during the actual training portion of the DVDs. The first 2 discs cover Days 1-3, and you will recognize many Magpul associates (like Drake or Dr. Drake from the Internet forums) as well as Aimpoint representatives. The Magpul shooters brought along a Masada/ACR rifle for the drills, which looks very different from the other AR15s. The fourth disc covers gear, but I felt it was way too broad and not very direct. They won't really call the optics or M4 rifles by the manufacturer's name, and they just give you general feedback on that type of gear. It is better to just hit the Internet and do a search for product reviews. But the point that Haley and Costa drives home is still valid, and that is each person is different and may prefer different types of gear.Overall: 4/5 stars, not as mandatory for static shooters but contains useful drills for LE, Military, and competition shooters.  The fundamentals that are covered briefly in the first disc are the most important.",4,"Covers fundamentals briefly, high value for LE/MIL/competition shooters",1324080000,"12 17, 2011",2011,3640,"['Magpul', 'Art', 'Tactical', 'Carbine', 'Volume', '2', 'DVDI', 'opted', 'skip', 'Volume', '1', 'based', 'feedback', 'other', 'viewers', 'Volume', '1', 'was', 'too', 'fundamental', 'have', 'ordered', 'Volume', '1', 'However', 'watched', 'Volume', '2', 'picked', 'up', 'lot', 'weapon', 'manipulation', 'skills', 'made', 'lot', 'sense', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'Art', 'Dynamic', 'Handgun', 'first', 'noted', 'presentation', 'instruction', 'was', 'noticeably', 'different', 'Dynamic', 'Handgun', '1st', 'Edition', 'presumably', 'less', 'humor', 'Haley', 'Costa', 'pick', 'Marines', 'more', 'often', 'production', 'quality', 'was', 'different', 'felt', 'Dynamic', 'Carbine', 'Volume', '2', 'was', 'more', 'professionally', 'edited/filmed', 'versus', 'Dynamic', 'Handgun.In', 'Art', 'Dynamic', 'Carbine', 'important', 'skill', 'being', 'taught', 'will', 'be', 'highlighted', 'small', 'graphic', 'up', 'jot', 'down', 'review', 'slow-motion', 'Disc', '3', 'Haley', 'Costa', 'make', 'note', 'Dynamic', 'Carbine', 'intended', 'teach', 'weapon', 'manipulation', 'drills', 'skills', 'not', 'tactics', 'are', 'lots', 'drills', 'urban', 'prone', 'dynamic', 'prone', 'buddy', 'skills', 'one-handed', 'malfunction', 'drills', 'etc', 'may', 'not', 'apply', '95', '%', 'shooters', 'just', 'go', 'static', 'range', 'are', 'useful', 'know', 'apply', 'LE/military', 'want', 'brush', 'up', 'skills.The', 'first', 'fundamental', 'covered', 'was', 'proper', 'grip', 'stance', 'something', 'never', 'learned', 'properly', 'could', 'go', 'was', 'standard', 'military', 'training/field', 'manuals', 'books', 'magazines', 'articles', 'written', 'Massad', 'Ayoob', 'photographs', 'Soldiers', 'engaging', 'enemy', 'targets', 'theater.Haley', 'Costa', 'picked', 'John', 'shooter', '2', 'point', 'sling', 'quite', 'often', 'mainly', 'slow', 'tactical', 'reloads', 'However', 'more', 'gear-related', 'mag', 'pouches', 'were', 'different', 'design', 'sling', 'would', 'require', 'additional', 'time', 'move', 'around', 'back', 'something', 'have', 'noticed', 'course', 'how', 'Magpul', 'Dynamics', 'need', 'gear', 'skills', 'work', 'more', 'efficiently', 'reaction', 'hand', 'grip', 'technique', 'counterintuitive', 'first', 'most', 'military', 'law', 'enforcement', 'training', 'new', 'Magpul', 'AFG', 'grip', 'type', 'position', 'appear', 'more', 'stable', 'traditional', 'magwell', 'VFG', 'offhand', 'grip', 'are', 'trying', 'mitigate', 'recoil', 'muzzle', 'movement', 'dynamic', 'environment', 'tightening', 'groups.I', 'have', 'noticed', 'Costa', 'better', 'speaking', 'Haley', 'Haley', 'often', 'too', 'fast', 'still', 'articulate', 'can', 'understand', 'clearly', 'Costa', 'more', 'Senior', 'NCO', 'can', 'somehow', 'project', 'voice', '5', 'mile', 'radius.The', 'outakes', 'are', 'funny', 'are', 'many', 'funny', 'moments', 'actual', 'training', 'portion', 'DVDs', 'first', '2', 'discs', 'cover', 'Days', '1-3', 'will', 'recognize', 'many', 'Magpul', 'associates', 'Drake', 'Dr.', 'Drake', 'Internet', 'forums', 'as', 'well', 'Aimpoint', 'representatives', 'Magpul', 'shooters', 'brought', 'along', 'Masada/ACR', 'rifle', 'drills', 'very', 'different', 'other', 'AR15s', 'fourth', 'disc', 'covers', 'gear', 'felt', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'broad', 'not', 'very', 'direct', 'wo', ""n't"", 'really', 'call', 'optics', 'M4', 'rifles', 'manufacturer', 'name', 'just', 'give', 'general', 'feedback', 'type', 'gear', 'better', 'just', 'hit', 'Internet', 'do', 'search', 'product', 'reviews', 'point', 'Haley', 'Costa', 'home', 'still', 'valid', 'person', 'different', 'may', 'prefer', 'different', 'types', 'gear.Overall', '4/5', 'stars', 'not', 'mandatory', 'static', 'shooters', 'useful', 'drills', 'LE', 'Military', 'competition', 'shooters', 'fundamentals', 'are', 'covered', 'briefly', 'first', 'disc', 'are', 'most', 'important']",Magpul DYN002 Art Of Tactical

The training, drills and coaching is utterly amazing. And the most important things that allows Magpul to pull this off is the great production values. The way old training videos are was a guy on a dirt range talking to a camcorder. Even the better trainers' videos were mostly them talking to a camera with little actual gun play. Magpul with this series has found a great balance, they put out great information, go through many ways of accomplishing drills in a easy to understand manner. But they do it with great camera work and presence.The highest praise I can give this is that my wife, who is a shooter, but not a lover of all things tactical, enjoy these DVDs. And I make that up to the fact that they are so easy to watch. The various cameras, the smart editing and the good interaction between the instructors and students. This is the best training video available on DVD. Will watching it make you the next super commando? Absolutely not, but they will give you a good understanding and a good number of drills to practice and work through. Hopefully before you sign up for a course and go to a class yourself.
