But then there's none either between her and the older anchor man, played very well by Mark Harmon. So what's left? Well, the script is smart, goes way beyond the essential comedy here to look at relationships and what they mean. Would this on screen meltdown by the weather girl ever be shown in real life TV? Nope. Still, it's watchable. I recommend this one.",4,Entertaining but unconvincing,1327017600,"01 20, 2012",2012,478,"['chemistry', 'weather', 'girl', 'younger', 'beau', 'what', 'whole', 'indie', 'hinges', 'then', 'none', 'older', 'anchor', 'man', 'played', 'very', 'well', 'Mark', 'Harmon', 'So', 'what', 'left', 'Well', 'script', 'smart', 'way', 'essential', 'comedy', 'here', 'look', 'relationships', 'what', 'mean', 'Would', 'screen', 'meltdown', 'weather', 'girl', 'ever', 'be', 'shown', 'real', 'life', 'TV', 'Nope', 'Still', 'watchable', 'recommend', 'one']",N/A
