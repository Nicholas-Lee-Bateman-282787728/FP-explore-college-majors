493327,ATEN79S375T53,B0000067ZK,PAUL V. WALSH,"[0, 0]","For myself, at any rate, this is one of those modest little jewels.  A charming little romantic comedy with an unlikely cast that play off of each other in a wonderful manner, assisted in no small way by a clever plot and a good script.  Ann Magnuson plays a publicity agent who is hired by NASA to generate positive buzz about their new robot that's been designed for solitary deep space exploration.  Both the robot (a clueless man-child) and its inventor (a brilliant nerd with zero social skills) are played by John Malkovich.  Fish out of water, mistaken identities, it's all there, but it's fresh, clever, and, at times, even a little touching.  Definitely a good choice for a date night.",5,Unexpected Delight,1356652800,"12 28, 2012",2012,694,"['rate', 'one', 'modest', 'little', 'jewels', 'charming', 'little', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'unlikely', 'cast', 'play', 'other', 'wonderful', 'manner', 'assisted', 'small', 'way', 'clever', 'plot', 'good', 'script', 'Ann', 'Magnuson', 'publicity', 'agent', 'who', 'hired', 'NASA', 'generate', 'positive', 'buzz', 'new', 'robot', 'been', 'designed', 'solitary', 'deep', 'space', 'exploration', 'robot', 'clueless', 'man-child', 'inventor', 'brilliant', 'nerd', 'zero', 'social', 'skills', 'are', 'played', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'Fish', 'water', 'mistaken', 'identities', 'there', 'fresh', 'clever', 'times', 'even', 'little', 'touching', 'Definitely', 'good', 'choice', 'date', 'night']",N/A
493328,A1CA1A1MGW0I3J,B0000067ZK,Raisuli the Magnificent,"[0, 0]","I'm pretty big on science fiction, and where this one doesn't have any heroics or shoot 'em stuff, it's still kind of a nice little film.  Definately a chick-flick, one wonders how the film might've ended up had a guy directed it.  Right now it's all cutesy and romantic.  Malkovich's characters are endearing to the female mind, and we get the dichotomy of a man divided.  His less sure and more intellectual half winds up with his dream, and his more down to earth side winds up with the girl.I saw this film many many years ago, but only in bits and pieces.  For the first time I'm finally able to see the whole film.  It's not a stellar achievement in film making, but it's got a certain appeal.  Because it is a woman directing the thing we get a romantic tale dealing with the emotional development between the characters and their relationships.  If a dude had directed the thing, it would've been heavy on the heavy-romance, deep, emotional and angst ridden.  Which is better?  Well, in spite of the fact that I've bought and written a lot of chick flick stuff as of recent, Im not really a chick flick dude.  I keep hoping to gleam something interesting form the fairer sexes viewpoint.  And I have, but that information is that some films should've have been directed by men.This one almost makes me thing that.  But, because it is a comedy I cut it some slack, and so should everyone else.  In that vein it's kid of a cute little film, as was the intent.  But it's almost a bit too cute for its own good.  It doesn't get campy enough, in my opinion to be the film that it truly wanted to be, but succeeds regardless.Malkovich does an excellent job of his duel roles, and Ann Magnuson is very good as the high powered marketer.  In fact the entire cast is very good, and we get some pretty decent comedy from the supports.All in all an okay watch.  An android/robot film told from the female perspective.",4,The film I wanted.,1301788800,"04 3, 2011",2011,1914,"[""'m"", 'pretty', 'big', 'science', 'fiction', 'where', 'one', ""n't"", 'have', 'heroics', 'shoot', 'stuff', 'still', 'kind', 'nice', 'little', 'film', 'Definately', 'chick-flick', 'one', 'how', 'film', 'might', ""'ve"", 'ended', 'up', 'had', 'guy', 'directed', 'Right', 'now', 'cutesy', 'romantic', 'Malkovich', 'characters', 'are', 'endearing', 'female', 'mind', 'get', 'dichotomy', 'man', 'divided', 'less', 'sure', 'more', 'intellectual', 'half', 'up', 'dream', 'more', 'down', 'earth', 'side', 'up', 'girl.I', 'saw', 'film', 'many', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'only', 'bits', 'pieces', 'first', 'time', ""'m"", 'finally', 'able', 'see', 'whole', 'film', 'not', 'stellar', 'achievement', 'film', 'making', 'got', 'certain', 'appeal', 'woman', 'directing', 'thing', 'get', 'romantic', 'tale', 'dealing', 'emotional', 'development', 'characters', 'relationships', 'dude', 'had', 'directed', 'thing', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'heavy', 'heavy-romance', 'deep', 'emotional', 'angst', 'ridden', 'Which', 'better', 'Well', 'spite', 'fact', ""'ve"", 'bought', 'written', 'lot', 'chick', 'flick', 'stuff', 'recent', 'Im', 'not', 'really', 'chick', 'flick', 'dude', 'keep', 'hoping', 'gleam', 'something', 'interesting', 'form', 'fairer', 'sexes', 'viewpoint', 'have', 'information', 'films', 'should', ""'ve"", 'have', 'been', 'directed', 'men.This', 'one', 'almost', 'thing', 'comedy', 'cut', 'slack', 'so', 'should', 'everyone', 'else', 'vein', 'kid', 'cute', 'little', 'film', 'was', 'intent', 'almost', 'bit', 'too', 'cute', 'own', 'good', ""n't"", 'get', 'campy', 'enough', 'opinion', 'be', 'film', 'truly', 'wanted', 'be', 'regardless.Malkovich', 'excellent', 'job', 'duel', 'roles', 'Ann', 'Magnuson', 'very', 'good', 'high', 'powered', 'marketer', 'fact', 'entire', 'cast', 'very', 'good', 'get', 'pretty', 'decent', 'comedy', 'supports.All', 'okay', 'watch', 'android/robot', 'film', 'told', 'female', 'perspective']",N/A

It reminds me of the screwball comedies from the 1930's and 40's. I very much like the stylized look of this movie. It has a very 60's meets 80's feel to it with a touch of futuristic space age mixed in. John Malkovich is so funny, charming and warm in this movie that it's hard to believe that this is the same actor who now does ""serious"" work. Ann Magnuson is very comedic, pretty and good, that it makes me wonder why she did not become a bigger star like Meg Ryan. I was quite excited when this movie was released on dvd. However, I was disappointed because the dvd really does not have any extra features over the vhs edition that I already owned.
