I have all of her 5 mile walk DVD's,  her &#34;You Can Do Stability Ball&#34; and &#34;You Can Do Pilates.&#34;  As always she starts out showing each step that you'll be doing and then you proceed to the workout.  She is easy to follow and the results are amazing.  You don't have to be crazy and get injured  in order to get the results you want from a workout.

After a back injury (unrelated to the exercise programs), I wanted to start yoga to increase overall flexibility and strength in my back.  I thought this dvd would be a great start, however, Leslie fails to provide enough instruction for each pose and I think a true yoga master would take issue with her technique for many of the poses.  A final criticism is that the actual workout is very short--too short given the price of the dvd.  Really, only the most basic poses are covered here, the ones that people are likely to have already heard of. Down Dog, Triagle, Cobra.  All are wonderful poses but just scratch the surface of what yoga offersI would recommend the Yoga Zone Beginners dvds, lots of instruction in to proper form and modifications for the true beginner.  Six weeks of doing yoga 3-4x a week has already made visible changes in my body and I am amazingly more flexible.",3,Leslie just isn't a yoga instructor,1147305600,"05 11, 2006",2006,988,"['have', '6-7', 'Leslie', 'Sansone', 'walking', 'workouts', 'love', 'have', 'been', 'doing', '2', 'years', 'now', 'back', 'injury', 'unrelated', 'exercise', 'programs', 'wanted', 'start', 'yoga', 'increase', 'overall', 'flexibility', 'strength', 'back', 'thought', 'dvd', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'start', 'however', 'Leslie', 'provide', 'enough', 'instruction', 'pose', 'think', 'true', 'yoga', 'master', 'would', 'take', 'issue', 'technique', 'many', 'poses', 'final', 'criticism', 'actual', 'workout', 'very', 'short', 'too', 'short', 'given', 'price', 'dvd', 'Really', 'only', 'most', 'basic', 'poses', 'are', 'covered', 'here', 'ones', 'people', 'are', 'likely', 'have', 'already', 'heard', 'Down', 'Dog', 'Triagle', 'Cobra', 'are', 'wonderful', 'poses', 'just', 'scratch', 'surface', 'what', 'yoga', 'offersI', 'would', 'recommend', 'Yoga', 'Zone', 'Beginners', 'dvds', 'lots', 'instruction', 'proper', 'form', 'modifications', 'true', 'beginner', 'Six', 'weeks', 'doing', 'yoga', '3-4x', 'week', 'already', 'made', 'visible', 'changes', 'body', 'am', 'amazingly', 'more', 'flexible']",Leslie Sansone - You Can Do Yoga
801034,AZRBMPSSC7YRM,B0001DHSCE,C. Williams,"[6, 7]",I love the Leslie Sansone videos and was happy to find the Yoga one.  I loved it.  It was just what I needed to start getting into a good yoga routine without having to go to the health club which only has yoga at night.  She has a learning session first to show you the moves then puts it into a routine.  She is always pleasant and always encourages you to do what you feel comfortable with.,5,Another Great Leslie Video,1169164800,"01 19, 2007",2007,393,"['love', 'Leslie', 'Sansone', 'videos', 'was', 'happy', 'find', 'Yoga', 'one', 'loved', 'was', 'just', 'what', 'needed', 'start', 'getting', 'good', 'yoga', 'routine', 'having', 'go', 'health', 'club', 'only', 'yoga', 'night', 'learning', 'session', 'first', 'show', 'moves', 'then', 'routine', 'always', 'pleasant', 'always', 'do', 'what', 'feel', 'comfortable']",Leslie Sansone - You Can Do Yoga

The DVD is divided into an introduction, showing the poses, some of them for an advanced beginner.  There is no explanation of props as aids until later, introduced in the second half, true work out.  The first half could have been left out for me.  The second half is the actual session.  Again, Leslie encourages work at your pace etc, but talks so much she does not cue you when to stop the pose, especially if you are twisted around and can't see the screen.  The variety of poses are good though and I would do the second half to augment my own practice.

It was just right for me starting out, Leslie talks but more appropriately for this kind of instruction (no whoops or hollers); and because I've never done yoga, I appreciated her instructions along the way. I felt so stretched and rejuvenated afterwards. She takes it slow and explains all the poses.I was disappointed when it ended because I wished it had been a bit longer.

My only complaint is she talks WAY too much for a Yoga tape.  Yoga is meant to be peaceful and relaxing and with her talking so much it's hard to do that.
