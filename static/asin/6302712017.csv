One of them was when we had field day and I refused to participate because the games that they had were stupid and for babies. I didn't tell anybody that a couple a games were for babies except for my mom and my older sister another time. The day my teacher a note home to my family about me not doing field day and I was grounded as a result.,4,I have seen this tape before.,1171756800,"02 18, 2007",2007,415,"['watched', 'tape', 'when', 'was', 'elementary', 'school', 'couple', 'times', 'One', 'was', 'when', 'had', 'field', 'day', 'refused', 'participate', 'games', 'had', 'were', 'stupid', 'babies', 'did', ""n't"", 'tell', 'anybody', 'couple', 'games', 'were', 'babies', 'mom', 'older', 'sister', 'time', 'day', 'teacher', 'note', 'home', 'family', 'not', 'doing', 'field', 'day', 'was', 'grounded', 'result']",Disney Sing Along Songs: Friend Like Me: Volume Eleven VHS

328515,A19RAJY6R7USN0,6302712017,"Lee Neville ""emotionboy""","[9, 9]","Of all the Disney Sing Along Songs on video, this is my favorite. As fans of Disney Sing Along Songs on DVD will know, there is a new intro for the DVDs featuring Sebastian the crab and a new theme song. Well on the early VHS versions the theme song featured Mr Owl. Sing Along Songs: Friend Like Me was the first video to revamp the original theme song, and it does such a great job, upping the music tempo and really getting you excited for this latest offering.The showstopping Disney Sing Along Songs video hosted by Jiminy Cricket from Pinocchio starts off with the showstopper ""Friend Like Me"" from what was the new big animated feature Aladdin. From here we get the classic song ""Best Of Friends"" from The Fox & The Hound and ""Something There"" from Beauty & The Beast. Next we have ""How Do You"" from the as yet unreleased on video or DVD- Song Of The South. Following this is a new high octane version of the classic song ""Friendship"", sung this time by Mickey Mouse, Goofy and Donald Duck. ""Harmony"" from the television series of The Little Mermaid featuring the beautiful voice of Jodi Benson as Ariel is next. Afterwards we're back to the classics with ""Let's Get Together"" from the original version of The Parent Trap and ""That's What Friend's Are For"" from The Jungle Book. Finally, we get to sing along with ""A Whole New World"" from Aladdin, as well as having the opportunity to sing Friend Like Me once more.This really is showstopping stuff. As a kid I found myself singing alone to many of the Disney Sing Along Songs videos, but this time even the family joined in. They loved it too, as I expect, you and your family will.",5,Showstopping Disney Sing Along Songs video,1123718400,"08 11, 2005",2005,1640,"['Disney', 'Sing', 'Along', 'Songs', 'video', 'favorite', 'fans', 'Disney', 'Sing', 'Along', 'Songs', 'DVD', 'will', 'know', 'new', 'intro', 'DVDs', 'featuring', 'Sebastian', 'crab', 'new', 'theme', 'song', 'Well', 'early', 'VHS', 'versions', 'theme', 'song', 'featured', 'Mr', 'Owl', 'Sing', 'Songs', 'Friend', 'Me', 'was', 'first', 'video', 'revamp', 'original', 'theme', 'song', 'great', 'job', 'upping', 'music', 'tempo', 'really', 'getting', 'excited', 'latest', 'offering.The', 'showstopping', 'Disney', 'Sing', 'Along', 'Songs', 'video', 'hosted', 'Jiminy', 'Cricket', 'Pinocchio', 'showstopper', 'Friend', 'Me', 'what', 'was', 'new', 'big', 'animated', 'feature', 'Aladdin', 'here', 'get', 'classic', 'song', 'Best', 'Friends', 'Fox', 'Hound', 'Something', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'have', 'How', 'Do', 'yet', 'unreleased', 'video', 'DVD-', 'Song', 'South', 'Following', 'new', 'high', 'octane', 'version', 'classic', 'song', 'Friendship', 'sung', 'time', 'Mickey', 'Mouse', 'Goofy', 'Donald', 'Duck', 'Harmony', 'television', 'series', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'featuring', 'beautiful', 'voice', 'Jodi', 'Benson', 'Ariel', 'next', ""'re"", 'back', 'classics', 'Let', 'Get', 'Together', 'original', 'version', 'Parent', 'Trap', 'What', 'Friend', 'Are', 'Jungle', 'Book', 'Finally', 'get', 'sing', 'along', 'A', 'Whole', 'New', 'World', 'Aladdin', 'as', 'well', 'having', 'opportunity', 'sing', 'Friend', 'Me', 'once', 'more.This', 'really', 'showstopping', 'stuff', 'kid', 'found', 'singing', 'alone', 'many', 'Disney', 'Sing', 'Along', 'Songs', 'videos', 'time', 'even', 'family', 'joined', 'loved', 'too', 'expect', 'family', 'will']",Disney Sing Along Songs: Friend Like Me: Volume Eleven VHS
