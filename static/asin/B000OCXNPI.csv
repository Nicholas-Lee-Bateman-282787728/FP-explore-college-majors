Long before NYPD Blue was catching the attention of our FCC censors, The Sweeney (Scotland Yard's Flying Squad of plain clothes detectives) was thrust upon UK viewers in the mid 70's, with some harsh language, occasional topless girls, and the over the top, violent antics of the fiercest cops in England.John Thaw, as Detective Inspector Jack Regan, perfectly fills what is possibly his best known role, apart from Inspector Morse. Dennis Waterman, as Regan's partner, Sergeant George Carter, is equally talented in fisticuffs, which would come in handy in Waterman's next series, Minder, where he played bodyguard for hire, Terry McCann.Regan often twisted the rules of the law to apprehend his criminals, usually convincing the apprehensive Carter to help. Regan was often in trouble with his superiors, and was under constant scrutiny from internal affairs. The show lasted 4 seasons, and ended with Regan actually getting ... well, I won't give it away!Apart from the double disc set of the 2 late 70's Sweeney big screen films, which has been available on Amazon for years now, the 4 seasons of this hugely popular British show have not been available in the US until now!

However, I found it to be too dated to be really interesting now and the macho atmosphere a bit juvenile.  I can imagine it was quite a sensation when it first appeared but cop shows, whether character or action driven and whether about upper crust characters or street denizens, have come a long way since then.  Also, the central character as a maverick officer/detective has also been done a lot and done better since that time.  Inspectors Morse, Frost, Lynley, and others like Vincent, DaVinci, Barnaby, the Sandbaggers,  etc. have all portrayed the smart cop who doesn't like to follow the rules and I found most of those to be better done and more engrossing than The Sweeney.",3,Interesting Early Cop Show But Dated,1192665600,"10 18, 2007",2007,779,"['had', 'high', 'hopes', 'series', 'reading', 'reviews', 'knowing', 'John', 'Thaw', 'starred', 'However', 'found', 'be', 'too', 'dated', 'be', 'really', 'interesting', 'now', 'macho', 'atmosphere', 'bit', 'juvenile', 'can', 'imagine', 'was', 'quite', 'sensation', 'when', 'first', 'appeared', 'cop', 'shows', 'character', 'action', 'driven', 'upper', 'crust', 'characters', 'street', 'denizens', 'have', 'come', 'long', 'way', 'then', 'Also', 'central', 'character', 'maverick', 'officer/detective', 'also', 'been', 'done', 'lot', 'done', 'better', 'time', 'Inspectors', 'Morse', 'Frost', 'Lynley', 'others', 'Vincent', 'DaVinci', 'Barnaby', 'Sandbaggers', 'etc', 'have', 'portrayed', 'smart', 'cop', 'who', ""n't"", 'like', 'follow', 'rules', 'found', 'most', 'be', 'better', 'done', 'more', 'engrossing', 'Sweeney']",The Sweeney - The Complete First Series

The sweeney were uncorruptible officiers of scotland yard and this show does them justice. With great acting from the whole cast.  Unfortunately we never got the rest of this series in region one. The company that put this out went out of business.  But if you buy a all region player you can get the rest of the series on dvd.  region 2 has them all and even a boxset of all 4 seasons, the pilot movie 'regan' and the two movies that were released to theaters.  Or you can buy them seperately.  I disagree that this is too seventies it's one of that decades best and yes it's not flashy like some of todays cop shows. Which I do enjoy alot but it is worth watching and enjoying the great John Thaw lay down the law in London circa 1975-79. The dvd has a great picture and this is similiar to what network dvd did with the series, They released the whole series overseas and you can go to their website or amazon.uk to get the rest of the series.  or the pilot movie 'regan'. You can still get the two movies on amazon.com though.  All region players are on sale on amazon.com as well.

We were saddened by Mr. Thaws death and wish to extend our sympathies to his family and all who enjoyed his work as much as we did.Because of our feelings for John Thaw, we decided to try ""The Sweeney"" even though it is a 1970's vintage English TV series.  Well, to our surprise, we loved that old series also.  The appeal is the outstanding writing, great directing, and excellent acting.  The Sweeney is an interesting character study of the chief protagonist and the lead characters in every episode.  The stories are as relevant today as they were in the 70's, and the audience can become immersed in the plot, even in the Summer 2010.

Well-written, sharply directed and the main cast are perfection. Nobody ever drank alcohol like Jack Regan; there was a certain way he swallowed the drink. John Thaw was perfect for this role, a gifted actor who added something special to it.

For the younger generation this will look old, the cars, the fashion (or lack of it) are all of the time, and unless you were around in the 70's it may be a difficult program stick with.

The Sweeney is cockney slang for the Flying Squad a group of elite dectectives who battle organised crime, armeed robbery and other crimes carried out by professional criminals.THe success of the show is due to the partership of John Thaw as Inspecter Jack Reagan and his sidekick Sargent George Carter played by Denis Waterman. Reagan and Carter spend as much of their time drinking, smoking and chasing women as they do catching criminals, this is the seventies after all. Morse may use his brains to catch the criminal, Reagan is more likely to use his fists.Unlike other British dectective shows the Sweeney does not involve complex murder cases set amougst the middle classes. The bad guys in the Sweeney are working class armed robbers, professional burglars and safe crackers. Reagan and Carter while being totaly honest (the real Flying Squad was famous for it's corruption) behave just like the villians they chase.Because guns have always been less common in Britain than in the US, even amougst criminals, the Sweeney contains some great fight scenes as the police battle it out with criminals armed with pickaxe handles, chains etc. The show also has some great comic one liners making it one of the most funny drama series ever.The Sweeney is a must for all lovers of cop shows.A few of the slang terms used in the show are,Bird -  WomanBlag -  RobberyBlagger -  RobberBlower -  TelephoneBottle -  Nerve or courage as in 'lost his bottle'Brahams -  DrunkBubble -  A GreekDrum -  House or flatFace -  Known criminalGermans -  HandsHave it away -  To escape, in particular to escape with stolen goods,also to have sexManor -  An area of London, a police district.Monkey -  500Nick -  Police stationNicked -  Arrested, as in your nicked.Pony -  25Score -  20Skip -  Police SargentSlagg -  Orginaly a women who slept arround, now a general term of abuse.Smudge -  PhotographTealeaf -  ThiefTom -  Jewelry or a prostitute.Ton -  one hundred especially 100Tooled up -  Armed",5,Before he was Morse John Thaw was Reagan,1179964800,"05 24, 2007",2007,2186,"['American', 'viewers', 'will', 'know', 'John', 'Thaw', ""'Morse"", 'many', 'British', 'viewers', 'will', 'always', 'be', ""'Jack"", 'Reagan', 'Scotland', 'Yard', 'Flying', 'Squad.The', 'Sweeney', 'was', 'complusive', 'viewing', 'nineteen', 'seventies', 'Sweeney', 'cockney', 'slang', 'Flying', 'Squad', 'group', 'elite', 'dectectives', 'who', 'battle', 'organised', 'crime', 'armeed', 'robbery', 'other', 'crimes', 'carried', 'out', 'professional', 'criminals.THe', 'success', 'show', 'due', 'partership', 'John', 'Thaw', 'Inspecter', 'Jack', 'Reagan', 'sidekick', 'Sargent', 'George', 'Carter', 'played', 'Denis', 'Waterman', 'Reagan', 'Carter', 'spend', 'much', 'time', 'drinking', 'smoking', 'chasing', 'women', 'do', 'catching', 'criminals', 'seventies', 'Morse', 'may', 'use', 'brains', 'catch', 'criminal', 'Reagan', 'more', 'likely', 'use', 'fists.Unlike', 'other', 'British', 'dectective', 'Sweeney', 'not', 'involve', 'complex', 'murder', 'cases', 'set', 'amougst', 'middle', 'classes', 'bad', 'guys', 'Sweeney', 'are', 'working', 'class', 'armed', 'robbers', 'professional', 'burglars', 'safe', 'crackers', 'Reagan', 'Carter', 'being', 'totaly', 'honest', 'real', 'Flying', 'Squad', 'was', 'famous', 'corruption', 'behave', 'just', 'villians', 'chase.Because', 'guns', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'less', 'common', 'Britain', 'US', 'even', 'amougst', 'criminals', 'Sweeney', 'great', 'fight', 'scenes', 'police', 'battle', 'out', 'criminals', 'armed', 'pickaxe', 'handles', 'chains', 'etc', 'show', 'also', 'great', 'comic', 'one', 'making', 'one', 'most', 'funny', 'drama', 'series', 'ever.The', 'Sweeney', 'must', 'lovers', 'cop', 'shows.A', 'few', 'slang', 'terms', 'used', 'show', 'are', 'Bird', 'WomanBlag', 'RobberyBlagger', 'RobberBlower', 'TelephoneBottle', 'Nerve', 'courage', ""'lost"", ""bottle'Brahams"", 'DrunkBubble', 'GreekDrum', 'House', 'flatFace', 'Known', 'criminalGermans', 'HandsHave', 'away', 'escape', 'particular', 'escape', 'stolen', 'goods', 'also', 'have', 'sexManor', 'area', 'London', 'police', 'district.Monkey', '500Nick', 'Police', 'stationNicked', 'Arrested', 'nicked.Pony', '25Score', '20Skip', 'Police', 'SargentSlagg', 'women', 'who', 'slept', 'now', 'general', 'term', 'abuse.Smudge', 'PhotographTealeaf', 'ThiefTom', 'Jewelry', 'prostitute.Ton', 'one', 'hundred', 'especially', '100Tooled', 'Armed']",The Sweeney - The Complete First Series
