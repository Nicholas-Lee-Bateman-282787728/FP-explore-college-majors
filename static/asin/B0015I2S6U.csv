1149715,A1E9QU27DMFRGS,B0015I2S6U,Danielle Turchiano,"[4, 8]","Fred Wolf's directorial debut, Strange Wilderness, was pushed back time and again before it finally had its theatrical release, however short-lived it may have been. Surrounded by a hapless crew, a barebones script, and low viewership, the plot (or lack thereof) of Strange Wilderness self-reflexively, and perhaps inadvertently, sheds some light on what went wrong with the film in general.  When Peter Gaulke (Steve Zahn)'s attempt to carry on his father's ""in the wild"" reality show faces cancellation, he sets out to find Bigfoot in order to boost ratings.  While Peter and his friends certainly aren't making quality programming, they do share quite a few laughs along the way.  Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for Wolf's film, which drags out crude inside jokes, interspersed with random animal footage equally crudely voiced-over, and just leaves the audience wishing they were lost in the wilderness.What was once seen as a clever, little tongue-in-cheek plot device of a show within a show, simultaneously mirroring and mocking the entertainment industry, has just become tired after so many repeated usages, and Strange Wilderness, in turn, is a stale formula. Furthermore, with a cast of improv comedic greats like Jonah Hill and Justin Long, Strange Wilderness had the potential to boast some classic one-liners, genuine laugh out-loud moments, and awkward pausing, but unfortunately it falls short on all but the latter.  Instead, Wolf keeps Hill, Long, and others like Peter Dante and Kevin Heffernan in the background; they are barely even supporting players, as their characters' moments don't add anything to push the plot along but instead seem more like desperate filler than anything substantial.  Side anecdotes, like Heffernan's character's alcoholism, reveal themselves presumably for more laughs (because they certainly don't add another dimension to the characters!) but end up just being awfully, tragically unfunny and awfully redundant... or maybe they're just plain awful.  In general, Strange Wilderness suffers by not being nearly as snappy as one has come to expect from a slacker comedy, and in its best moments, only induces weak chuckling.Both ""Strange Wilderness,"" the fictional reality show and Strange Wilderness, the movie, rely on the token hot girl (Cheryl, portrayed by Ashley Scott), as well as physical humor (animals mating in the former and stoned falls in the latter) to keep people interested.  Scott, for her credit, manages to hold her own amidst the testosterone-- even if it is a question mark as to why she'd want to get involved with these perpetual screw-ups in the first place-- but she often gets swallowed up in the mess and her dialogue cut out, as is evidenced by some of the extended and deleted scenes on the DVD.",3,I'd Rather Be Lost In The Wilderness,1211241600,"05 20, 2008",2008,2782,"['Fred', 'Wolf', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Strange', 'Wilderness', 'was', 'pushed', 'back', 'time', 'again', 'finally', 'had', 'theatrical', 'release', 'however', 'short-lived', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'Surrounded', 'hapless', 'crew', 'barebones', 'script', 'low', 'viewership', 'plot', 'lack', 'thereof', 'Strange', 'Wilderness', 'self-reflexively', 'perhaps', 'inadvertently', 'light', 'went', 'wrong', 'film', 'general', 'When', 'Peter', 'Gaulke', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'attempt', 'carry', 'father', 'wild', 'reality', 'show', 'cancellation', 'out', 'find', 'Bigfoot', 'order', 'boost', 'ratings', 'Peter', 'friends', 'certainly', 'are', ""n't"", 'making', 'quality', 'programming', 'do', 'share', 'quite', 'few', 'laughs', 'way', 'Unfortunately', 'same', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'said', 'Wolf', 'film', 'out', 'crude', 'jokes', 'interspersed', 'random', 'animal', 'footage', 'equally', 'crudely', 'voiced-over', 'just', 'audience', 'wishing', 'were', 'lost', 'wilderness.What', 'was', 'once', 'seen', 'clever', 'little', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'plot', 'device', 'show', 'show', 'simultaneously', 'mirroring', 'mocking', 'entertainment', 'industry', 'just', 'become', 'tired', 'so', 'many', 'repeated', 'usages', 'Strange', 'Wilderness', 'turn', 'stale', 'formula', 'Furthermore', 'cast', 'improv', 'comedic', 'greats', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'Justin', 'Long', 'Strange', 'Wilderness', 'had', 'potential', 'boast', 'classic', 'one-liners', 'genuine', 'out-loud', 'moments', 'awkward', 'pausing', 'unfortunately', 'short', 'latter', 'Instead', 'Wolf', 'Hill', 'Long', 'others', 'Peter', 'Dante', 'Kevin', 'Heffernan', 'background', 'are', 'barely', 'even', 'supporting', 'players', 'characters', 'moments', 'do', ""n't"", 'add', 'anything', 'push', 'plot', 'instead', 'seem', 'more', 'like', 'desperate', 'filler', 'anything', 'substantial', 'Side', 'Heffernan', 'character', 'alcoholism', 'reveal', 'presumably', 'more', 'laughs', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'add', 'dimension', 'characters', 'end', 'up', 'just', 'being', 'awfully', 'tragically', 'unfunny', 'awfully', 'redundant', 'maybe', ""'re"", 'just', 'plain', 'awful', 'general', 'Strange', 'Wilderness', 'suffers', 'not', 'being', 'nearly', 'as', 'snappy', 'one', 'come', 'expect', 'slacker', 'comedy', 'best', 'moments', 'only', 'weak', 'chuckling.Both', 'Strange', 'Wilderness', 'fictional', 'reality', 'show', 'Strange', 'Wilderness', 'movie', 'rely', 'token', 'hot', 'girl', 'Cheryl', 'portrayed', 'Ashley', 'Scott', 'as', 'well', 'physical', 'humor', 'animals', 'mating', 'former', 'stoned', 'falls', 'latter', 'keep', 'people', 'interested', 'Scott', 'credit', 'hold', 'own', 'amidst', 'testosterone', 'even', 'question', 'mark', 'why', ""'d"", 'want', 'get', 'involved', 'perpetual', 'screw-ups', 'first', 'place', 'often', 'swallowed', 'up', 'mess', 'dialogue', 'cut', 'out', 'evidenced', 'extended', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'DVD']",N/A

1149719,A369KP0JV77JYT,B0015I2S6U,Jon,"[0, 0]","This is a very bizarre movie.  It's a mash of toilet humor, hilarious random-type humor, and shock humor.  You're not expecting some great American cinematic experience for the ages, but this was weird even for a stoner/college guy movie.I wish the entire movie was the actual wilderness show they did within the movie with their hilarious commentary.  One scene where Jeff Garlin's character is going through footage from their show and asks basically what the heck the background music is and why they would show it, after having shown other similar random footage (like a guy on fire), made my friend who rarely laughs at movies just lose it and crack up for about three minutes to the point of tears coming down his eyes.  Quotes like, ""Bears are a proud people, although they're not people per-say. They're animals."" were awesome.  Unfortunately those parts only last a few minutes.  An entire movie of just completely ridiculously-made up facts with animal footage would've been so much better.Unfortunately however the movie continues to get weirder and stupider.  It ends with the actors in the movie seeming to actually start laughing in real life, randomly.  We thought it was the kind of movie the director probably lost future gigs directing for having done this movie.  Unless the director was a 12-year-old, then I suppose he'd have his whole life in front of him still.The random pretty gal I've never seen before in any movie seemed like someone where when casting they were like, ""Oh no, we need an attractive woman too - yoo hoo, hey, Miss, come be in a movie?"" And she probably looked in a nearby mirror with a blank expression on her face for a half hour and eventually replied, ""Okay.""The other characters in this movie were generally irritating and repeats of the same characters each actor has done in other movies.  Jonah Hill with a southern accent made me want to drink southern comfort.  Justin Long being an irritating stoner (basically his same character from Idiocracy) made me want to light up.  And I don't drink hard liquor or smoke.  Kevin Heffernan, who did nothing in the movie, needed a paycheck apparently.  Covert and Zahn, with Garlin briefly, were the entire movie.It is very funny at parts.  Unfortunately those parts are very sporadic and unpredictable.  I would say if you like Grandma's Boy and Half Baked a lot (which were both great), then you may still enjoy watching this movie.",2,"Gets really really REALLY dumb, though still worth renting (but not buying)",1393804800,"03 3, 2014",2014,2427,"['very', 'bizarre', 'movie', 'mash', 'toilet', 'humor', 'hilarious', 'random-type', 'humor', 'shock', 'humor', ""'re"", 'not', 'expecting', 'great', 'American', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'ages', 'was', 'weird', 'even', 'stoner/college', 'guy', 'movie.I', 'wish', 'entire', 'movie', 'was', 'actual', 'wilderness', 'show', 'did', 'movie', 'hilarious', 'commentary', 'One', 'scene', 'where', 'Jeff', 'Garlin', 'character', 'going', 'footage', 'show', 'basically', 'what', 'heck', 'background', 'music', 'why', 'would', 'show', 'having', 'shown', 'other', 'similar', 'random', 'footage', 'guy', 'fire', 'made', 'friend', 'who', 'rarely', 'movies', 'just', 'lose', 'crack', 'up', 'three', 'minutes', 'point', 'tears', 'coming', 'down', 'eyes', 'Quotes', 'Bears', 'are', 'proud', 'people', ""'re"", 'not', 'people', 'per-say', ""'re"", 'animals', 'were', 'awesome', 'Unfortunately', 'parts', 'only', 'last', 'few', 'minutes', 'entire', 'movie', 'just', 'completely', 'ridiculously-made', 'up', 'facts', 'animal', 'footage', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better.Unfortunately', 'however', 'movie', 'get', 'weirder', 'stupider', 'actors', 'movie', 'seeming', 'actually', 'start', 'laughing', 'real', 'life', 'randomly', 'thought', 'was', 'kind', 'movie', 'director', 'probably', 'lost', 'future', 'gigs', 'directing', 'having', 'done', 'movie', 'director', 'was', '12-year-old', 'then', 'suppose', ""'d"", 'have', 'whole', 'life', 'front', 'still.The', 'random', 'pretty', 'gal', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'movie', 'seemed', 'someone', 'where', 'when', 'casting', 'were', 'Oh', 'need', 'attractive', 'woman', 'too', 'yoo', 'hoo', 'hey', 'Miss', 'come', 'be', 'movie', 'probably', 'looked', 'nearby', 'mirror', 'blank', 'expression', 'face', 'half', 'hour', 'eventually', 'replied', 'Okay', 'other', 'characters', 'movie', 'were', 'generally', 'irritating', 'repeats', 'same', 'characters', 'actor', 'done', 'other', 'movies', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'southern', 'accent', 'made', 'want', 'drink', 'southern', 'comfort', 'Justin', 'Long', 'being', 'irritating', 'stoner', 'basically', 'same', 'character', 'Idiocracy', 'made', 'want', 'light', 'up', 'do', ""n't"", 'drink', 'hard', 'liquor', 'smoke', 'Kevin', 'Heffernan', 'who', 'did', 'nothing', 'movie', 'needed', 'paycheck', 'apparently', 'Covert', 'Zahn', 'Garlin', 'briefly', 'were', 'entire', 'movie.It', 'very', 'funny', 'parts', 'Unfortunately', 'parts', 'are', 'very', 'sporadic', 'unpredictable', 'would', 'say', 'like', 'Grandma', 'Boy', 'Half', 'Baked', 'lot', 'were', 'great', 'then', 'may', 'still', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'movie']",N/A
1149720,A32IDF7JFAPXAG,B0015I2S6U,"Joshua Glowzinski ""Gman""","[1, 3]","I have my theory on movies.  Most of the time, if a film is under 90 minutes.  It is going to lack quality.  Now don't get me wrong.  This is not true 100  percent of the time.  But 9 our of 10 times it is for me.  So even though I saw that the time was only 84 minutes I still decided to buy it.  I paid like 20 dollars for this and I feel that I got ripped off.  20 dollars for a good movie that is about and hour and 40 minutes is a lot.  But for a movie that after the previews is about 82 minutes is a complete rip off.The movie has some good actors.  Some are more well known than others.  The cast includes Steve Zahn who has been in films like That Thing You Do 1996 and Saving Silverman 2001.  Allen Covert who you have seen in films like The Waterboy and Mr. Deeds and Jonah Hill whom you have seen in movies like Knocked up and Superbad.  My favorite of these is Steve Zahn.  If you have never seen him in Rescue Dawn I would say buy or rent it.  It is a different part than I am used to seeing  him in and he does an amazing job.Now for the plot.  This shouldn't take long because it is a pretty weak plot.  The movie is about some guys who have a nature show.  They don't do a very good job making the show nor do they know about anything they are talking about.  They get canceled and decide to go find big foot.  They all think this will make them famous and there show will be back.  That is the entire story folks.  Along the way some low grade comedy will happen.  Think of Adam Sandlers first few movies.  I didn't really laugh at any of it.  Perhaps if I watched it a second time I would understand it more.  But as of this moment I think it was unfunny.  I do think it's cool though that the actors chose to be in a movie like this.  There are some great actors in this movie and they still chose to be in a movie that wasn't guaranteed to make millions and millions of dollars.  It's cool when great actors still play parts in lower cost movies like this.  Maybe that is why I still have mine and haven't sold it yet.I wanted to take a second to talk about my rating.  I gave this movie a 3 out of 5.  What I think that means is the movie a alright to watch once.  I would not watch it over and over again.  Maybe if there was nothing great on and that was on TV I would watch it.  A 1 and 2 would be movies that I couldn't watch all the way through or ever again.  A 4 is a movie that I can see watching more than once.  A movie that really did well at everything it tried to do and finally a 5 is a movie that is perfection.  Everything about it is great.  Anytime it was on I would more than likely watch it.  So with all that in mind, that this review as you will and thanks for taking time to read it.",3,A movie that's short length makes it better.,1219708800,"08 26, 2008",2008,2728,"['have', 'theory', 'movies', 'Most', 'time', 'film', '90', 'minutes', 'going', 'lack', 'quality', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'not', 'true', '100', 'percent', 'time', '9', '10', 'times', 'So', 'even', 'saw', 'time', 'was', 'only', '84', 'minutes', 'still', 'decided', 'buy', 'paid', '20', 'dollars', 'feel', 'got', 'ripped', 'off', '20', 'dollars', 'good', 'movie', 'hour', '40', 'minutes', 'lot', 'movie', 'previews', '82', 'minutes', 'complete', 'rip', 'off.The', 'movie', 'good', 'actors', 'are', 'more', 'well', 'known', 'others', 'cast', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'who', 'been', 'films', 'Thing', 'Do', '1996', 'Saving', 'Silverman', '2001', 'Allen', 'Covert', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'films', 'Waterboy', 'Mr', 'Deeds', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'whom', 'have', 'seen', 'movies', 'Knocked', 'up', 'Superbad', 'favorite', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'Rescue', 'Dawn', 'would', 'say', 'buy', 'rent', 'different', 'part', 'am', 'used', 'seeing', 'amazing', 'job.Now', 'plot', 'should', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'pretty', 'weak', 'plot', 'movie', 'guys', 'who', 'have', 'nature', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'making', 'show', 'do', 'know', 'anything', 'are', 'talking', 'get', 'canceled', 'decide', 'go', 'find', 'big', 'foot', 'think', 'will', 'make', 'famous', 'show', 'will', 'be', 'back', 'entire', 'story', 'folks', 'way', 'low', 'grade', 'comedy', 'will', 'happen', 'Think', 'Adam', 'Sandlers', 'first', 'few', 'movies', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'laugh', 'Perhaps', 'watched', 'second', 'time', 'would', 'understand', 'more', 'moment', 'think', 'was', 'unfunny', 'do', 'think', 'cool', 'actors', 'chose', 'be', 'movie', 'are', 'great', 'actors', 'movie', 'still', 'chose', 'be', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'guaranteed', 'make', 'millions', 'millions', 'dollars', 'cool', 'when', 'great', 'actors', 'still', 'play', 'parts', 'lower', 'cost', 'movies', 'Maybe', 'why', 'still', 'have', 'mine', 'have', ""n't"", 'sold', 'yet.I', 'wanted', 'take', 'second', 'talk', 'rating', 'gave', 'movie', '3', '5', 'What', 'think', 'movie', 'alright', 'watch', 'once', 'would', 'not', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'Maybe', 'was', 'nothing', 'great', 'was', 'TV', 'would', 'watch', '1', '2', 'would', 'be', 'movies', 'could', ""n't"", 'watch', 'way', 'ever', 'again', '4', 'movie', 'can', 'see', 'watching', 'more', 'once', 'movie', 'really', 'did', 'well', 'everything', 'tried', 'do', 'finally', '5', 'movie', 'perfection', 'Everything', 'great', 'Anytime', 'was', 'would', 'more', 'likely', 'watch', 'So', 'mind', 'review', 'will', 'thanks', 'taking', 'time', 'read']",N/A

It makes me wonder how they got such a cast together, and it still falls flat on it's butt by the end of the film?So it stars the guy from Joyride, who is a Wilderness show host who is trying to follow in the footsteps of his father, making a mockery of the show by adding stupid dialog over wilderness footage. That was kinda funny for a while, but went pretty dry by the end of the film.Farvar from ""Super Troopers"" and the fat guy from ""Knocked Up"" are here as well.

The lead went to Steve Zahn, who's a decent actor, but was he the best choice for an R-rated comedy romp?  I dunno...The story centers around a group of guys who are determined to have their nature-based TV show go from being considered embarrassing to supreme, despite lacking any originality or direction in regards to nature shows.  The group finds themselves on an adventure and usually falls victim to their own ineptitude.Much like the TV show in the film, the movie itself tends to lack originality or direction.  It features a lot of the elements found in other Happy Madison productions, including the dopey heroes, unethical villains, and slapstick comedy where everything seems to fall apart until the end.  The most telling point was the end of the film, where the ending came at such an anti-climactic measure that by the time it was all said and done, it would leave you asking yourself ""... was that it?""Bottom line:  There was too much talent in the film for it to have performed the way it did.

Zwick,"[7, 8]","***1/2""Strange Wilderness"" is a good-natured, frequently hilarious takeoff on all those nature documentaries that play on the Discovery Channel and Animal Planet, and whose pedigree stretches all the way back to the granddaddy of them all, ""Mutual of Omaha`s Wild Kingdom.""  Peter and Fred are the producers of a wildlife series entitled ""Strange Wilderness"" that has been foundering in the ratings ever since Peter's father, a Steve Irwin-type naturist and the original host of the show, passed away, leaving his less-than-stellar son to carry on his legacy.  The sheer scientific illiteracy of much of the commentary that Peter provides for his footage probably hasn't helped matters much in this regard.  Now faced with the prospect of series cancellation, Peter and his crew of incompetent dweebs head off to the wilds of South America to file an exclusive report on the famed Bigfoot who has recently been spotted there.Though adolescent in the extreme, ""Strange Wilderness"" turns out to be a zany, endearingly random and unflaggingly energetic little comedy whose likable cast is obviously dialed into what the moviemakers are trying to do here.  Steve Zahn, Allen Covert, Covert, Ernest Borgnine, Jeff Garlin, Kevin Heffernan, Justin Long and Harry Hamlin seem to be having the time of their lives here and their enjoyment rubs off on us as well.Is it dumb?  Of course it is.  Is it lowbrow, inane and hopelessly juvenile?  You betcha'.  But unlike so many other films that fall into those categories, ""Strange Wilderness"" has a shrewd mind for parody and a liveliness of spirit that actually make the movie funny.  Credit scenarist Peter Gaulke and co-author/director Fred Wolf (who first developed this concept as sketches on ""Saturday Night Live"") for some excellent joke-writing and pacing and for their willingness to pull out all the stops in their effort to get the laugh.
