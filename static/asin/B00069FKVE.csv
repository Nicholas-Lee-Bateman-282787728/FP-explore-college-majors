864089,A2SPPYRTIHYSIK,B00069FKVE,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]",Edges of the Lord is a GREAT movie set in the World War II era during the invasion of Poland.  It is about a family who does what they can to save their child from being captured because he is Jewish and details the risks taken by those who assist with the plan.  All of the actors did outstanding jobs in their roles.  The movie is full of suspense and surprises and has a great story line.

If you are a fan of Haley Joel Osment (what's not to love?) or even if you are not, this is a film that will have you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end, with emotional twists and turns that left me gasping for air. This film was never theatrically released in the United States (I don't know why) but it is definitely available on DVD and definitely worth watching and sharing.Osment plays a little Jewish boy who is sent away by his parents to hide in the country side where he must pretend to be Catholic. This means this little tiny child must understand what it is to be Jewish, why it is dangerous, what it means to be Catholic and why it is important. Finding a group of friends to play with, it is intriguing to watch how they interpret their own Catholicism, and how it is acted out within the context of WWII.See this movie.

864092,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00069FKVE,Grady Harp,"[101, 107]","EDGES OF THE LORD is a film that, once seen, creates in the viewer the need to call every friend and recommend their seeing it.  As conceived and directed by Yurek Bogayevicz and by using primarily a Polish cast shot on location in various areas of Poland, this film appears to be a simple tale of courage of a young Jewish boy Romek (Haley Joel Osment) whose parents wisely see the encroaching genocide by the Nazis and out of love, teach their son the basics of Catholicism so that Romek can pass as a Catholic and be placed with a Catholic family in order to save him from the Nazi exterminations.Romek lands with a family whose children include an older child Vladek (Richard Banel) and a younger Tolo (Liam Hess).  The family understands that Romek is a Jew and even the young children incorporate that fact into their cohabitation.  The village priest (Willem Dafoe) likewise takes Romek under his wing and in a touching scene while the priest is cutting the 'hosts' for Catholic communion from a wafer sheet, he tells Romek that the uneven portions are the 'edges of the Lord' and therefore Romek may eat them as a Jew without betraying his own religious beliefs.The boys are part of a circle of preadolescent friends which includes one girl Maria (Ola Frycz) who slowly warms to Romek.  In the priest's cataclysm class the children are assigned roles as Apostles and Tolo assumes the identity of Jesus.  It is this assumption of the life of Jesus (sneaking a crown of rose thorns under his cap, tying himself to a tree ('cross'), and ultimately making a sacrifice for Romek in imitation of Christ's mission) that provides some of the more exquisitely beautiful moments in this lovely film.The story can be watched and absorbed on many levels: the effect of the atrocities of the Nazi occupation on Polish Jews, the sanctity of the family unit and the terror of living in an occupied country in the time of war, the delicate line children tread to become adults, the inhumanity of man as contrasted to the profound humanity of man - all of these threads are woven into this Polish tapestry of tremendous emotional impact.While the performances by Osment and Dafoe are expectedly fine, the roles of the Polish actors - especially the incandescent Liam Hess as Tolo - are extraordinary. This is truly a masterful work that deserves a very wide audience.  Highly Recommended!

It depicts actions taken by Polish people in their ordinary lives to counter the predations of the occupying Nazis. Actions which could have cost them their lives. It is not, however, a flagwaving tub thumper that rewrites history to make the Poles out to all be innocent angels. There were collaborators and Nazi sympathisers in every one of the allied nations, and this film shows that Poland was no different. Contrary to remarks by other reviewers, not all of the actors were employing fake accents, and not all of the fake accents were inaccurate (I speak as someone who knows people from that region of Poland). The reason for the use of actors from different nations would be that the production was made with money from more than one country, and also because a film with actors from different nations would have wider appeal. The accent issue does not detract from one's ability to watch the film, although I would argue that this is not a film that is there to entertain.

864100,A2GJ98824GGXGP,B00069FKVE,Timothy Kearney,"[31, 32]","I made this selection based by ""judging the book by its cover"" so to speak. I saw Haley Joel Osmont on the cover, saw William Dafoe as a priest, quickly read the summary on the back and took no notice of the rating. I expected a kindly story about a young Jewish boy ""rescued"" by Christians in Poland during World War II and expected it to be moving and probably perfect for family viewing. Well, all I needed was one viewing to know I made wrong assumption, but making this wrong assumption and expecting a different film may be why this film moved me so.The film tells the story of Romek, played by Osmont, who is sent to the Polish countryside to avoid being captured by the Nazis. The village may be remote, but it is hardly immune to the World War that is taking place. Romek has the expected scuffles with the village's children but eventually find his place.  Yet he also experiences the horrors that cannot be avoided in such a story.Perhaps what makes this film outstanding is that it is not a typical Holocaust survival film. The film accurately portrays the moral ambiguities that were very much a part of life during the Second World War, especially for Europeans. We see a different type of Catholicism, not the often stereotypes Catholicism that is all too often seen in films, but the unique strain of Polish Catholicism. There is plenty of conflict in the film on many different levels. There are tensions between Romek and the other children that are typical of children's interactions, yet we also know that some of the conflicts are at a deeper level when people suspect why Romek is living in the village. We see the atrocities of war, but we see it through the beautiful acting and writing of the film and not through graphic gimmicks.There are a number of elements in this film that will catch the viewer by surprise and in the end, make the viewer think. It is worth watching and without question will cause the viewer to think about the bravery of so many during the Second World War, the atrocities that were all too much a part of it, and how easily we can take human rights for granted.

864101,ACM90BRKX73OG,B00069FKVE,Tom,"[0, 0]","In German-occupied Krakow, a Jewish father and mother place their twelve-year-old son, Romek (Haley Joel Osment), with a Polish Gentile family living in the countryside just prior to the deportation of the Jews to extermination camps beginning in May 1942. Romek is not eagerly welcomed by the family's oldest son, Wladek (Richard Banel), but little Tolo (Liam Hess) takes a shine to him. Wladek's girlfriend, Maria (Olga Frycz), develops tender feelings for Romek, which further fuels the tension between the two boys.Romek lives in constant anxiety as neighbors suspect he is a Jew and threaten to ""out"" him to the Germans both out of fear of reprisal and anti-Semitism. The gruff-but-caring local priest (Willem Dafoe) takes Romek under his wing and begins religious instruction for all the children as precocious Tolo strongly identifies with the suffering and redemptive Christ.The children witness the horrors of the occupation and Holocaust, first as bystanders, then as victims, and finally as participants. Little Tolo makes the ultimate sacrifice believing he is expiating the sins of his family and humanity.Edges of the Lord is an intense and moving film. The four children give fine performances, although the viewer must pay close attention to the dialogue which at times is difficult to follow. The interesting Tolo character reminded me just a bit of John Irving's redemptive Owen Meany/Simon Birch. Olga Frycz has since gone on to become an accomplished young actress. Beautiful Malgorzata Foremniak, one of Poland's most popular actresses, gives a fine performance as the Polish family's mother. When Malgosia's on screen it's impossible to take one's eyes off of her.Director Jerzy Bogajewicz also wrote the screenplay of this 2001 Polish-American co-production. The film was not distributed in the US but went straight to DVD. Still, Edges of the Lord is well worth seeing even though it plays a bit loose with history. No Jewish professors and their families were living in comfortable apartments in Krakow by 1942. Also, Polish anti-Semitism is a bit watered down in this treatment whereas it was actually quite prevalent throughout interbellum and occupied Poland. Unfortunately, even today there are many in Poland and Polonia who have no use for those on the ""edges.""",4,Hatred and help,1359072000,"01 25, 2013",2013,2292,"['German-occupied', 'Krakow', 'Jewish', 'father', 'mother', 'place', 'twelve-year-old', 'son', 'Romek', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'Polish', 'Gentile', 'family', 'living', 'countryside', 'just', 'prior', 'deportation', 'Jews', 'extermination', 'camps', 'beginning', 'May', '1942', 'Romek', 'not', 'eagerly', 'welcomed', 'family', 'oldest', 'son', 'Wladek', 'Richard', 'Banel', 'little', 'Tolo', 'Liam', 'Hess', 'shine', 'Wladek', 'girlfriend', 'Maria', 'Olga', 'Frycz', 'tender', 'feelings', 'Romek', 'further', 'tension', 'two', 'boys.Romek', 'lives', 'constant', 'anxiety', 'neighbors', 'suspect', 'Jew', 'threaten', 'out', 'Germans', 'fear', 'reprisal', 'anti-Semitism', 'gruff-but-caring', 'local', 'priest', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'Romek', 'wing', 'religious', 'instruction', 'children', 'precocious', 'Tolo', 'strongly', 'suffering', 'redemptive', 'Christ.The', 'children', 'witness', 'horrors', 'occupation', 'Holocaust', 'first', 'bystanders', 'then', 'victims', 'finally', 'participants', 'Little', 'Tolo', 'ultimate', 'sacrifice', 'believing', 'expiating', 'sins', 'family', 'humanity.Edges', 'Lord', 'intense', 'moving', 'film', 'four', 'children', 'give', 'fine', 'performances', 'viewer', 'must', 'pay', 'close', 'attention', 'dialogue', 'times', 'difficult', 'follow', 'interesting', 'Tolo', 'character', 'reminded', 'just', 'bit', 'John', 'Irving', 'redemptive', 'Owen', 'Meany/Simon', 'Birch', 'Olga', 'Frycz', 'gone', 'become', 'accomplished', 'young', 'actress', 'Beautiful', 'Malgorzata', 'Foremniak', 'one', 'Poland', 'most', 'popular', 'actresses', 'fine', 'performance', 'Polish', 'family', 'mother', 'When', 'Malgosia', 'screen', 'impossible', 'take', 'one', 'eyes', 'her.Director', 'Jerzy', 'Bogajewicz', 'also', 'wrote', 'screenplay', '2001', 'Polish-American', 'co-production', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'distributed', 'US', 'went', 'straight', 'DVD', 'Still', 'Edges', 'Lord', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing', 'even', 'bit', 'loose', 'history', 'Jewish', 'professors', 'families', 'were', 'living', 'comfortable', 'apartments', 'Krakow', '1942', 'Also', 'Polish', 'anti-Semitism', 'bit', 'watered', 'down', 'treatment', 'was', 'actually', 'quite', 'prevalent', 'interbellum', 'occupied', 'Poland', 'Unfortunately', 'even', 'today', 'are', 'many', 'Poland', 'Polonia', 'who', 'have', 'use', 'edges']",Edges of the Lord

I believe this never saw theatrical release in the US and went straight to DVD. A pity really because it certainly merits multiple viewings, although the subject matter is one that is heartbreaking.The film's stars are all young children and the adults are more secondary characters, and the focus is on how these children and adolescents navigate life during a turbulent period, i.e. WW II.12-year-old Romek is a Jewish boy who is sent away to a remote Polish village to live with a Catholic peasant and his family comprising his wife and two young sons. Romek (Haley Joel-Osment in a finely nuanced performance) is passed off as a relative of the farmer, Gniecio. Romek learns to adjust to this different life, always wary of who he is, and manages to get along with Wladek (the older boy), and young Tollo who is prone to dramatics. They form friendship with a young girl Maria and life seems idyllic, with the children learning Catechism from the village priest, played by Willem Dafoe. However, the children are not immune to the turmoil of the times - economic hardships necessitate desperate acts like keeping pigs (illegal under Nazi ruling) and the children witness terrible atrocities like villagers getting executed, and worse. A neighbor named Kluba is depicted as brutish and suspicious and his son is a tyrannical bully who gets off by preying on Jews who escape the trains bound for the camps.Through all these events, young Romek tries desperately to understand the new world he is thrust into - and begins to take on the life of a village peasant boy. However, the darkness of the Holocaust gets increasingly closer to Romek, with events unfolding in a wholly unexpected and shocking manner that literally took my breath away. The film is rated R - there are scenes of brutality and violence, including a rape scene. This is nevertheless a great addition to any Holocaust film library, and I intend to watch it again, taking things in a little more slowly this time, for this is a multi-layered film that is intense as it is dark, with moments of beauty and horror, all seen through the eyes of children.",5,Heartbreaking coming-of-age story set in Poland during WW II,1390435200,"01 23, 2014",2014,2199,"['one', 'undiscovered', 'gems', ""'m"", 'glad', 'have', 'finally', 'viewed', 'believe', 'never', 'theatrical', 'release', 'US', 'went', 'straight', 'DVD', 'pity', 'really', 'certainly', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'subject', 'matter', 'one', 'heartbreaking.The', 'film', 'stars', 'are', 'young', 'children', 'adults', 'are', 'more', 'secondary', 'characters', 'focus', 'how', 'children', 'adolescents', 'navigate', 'life', 'turbulent', 'period', 'i.e', 'WW', 'II.12-year-old', 'Romek', 'Jewish', 'boy', 'who', 'sent', 'away', 'remote', 'Polish', 'village', 'live', 'Catholic', 'peasant', 'family', 'comprising', 'wife', 'two', 'young', 'sons', 'Romek', 'Haley', 'Joel-Osment', 'finely', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'passed', 'off', 'relative', 'farmer', 'Gniecio', 'Romek', 'adjust', 'different', 'life', 'always', 'wary', 'who', 'get', 'Wladek', 'older', 'boy', 'young', 'Tollo', 'who', 'prone', 'dramatics', 'form', 'friendship', 'young', 'girl', 'Maria', 'life', 'idyllic', 'children', 'learning', 'Catechism', 'village', 'priest', 'played', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'However', 'children', 'are', 'not', 'immune', 'turmoil', 'times', 'economic', 'hardships', 'necessitate', 'desperate', 'acts', 'keeping', 'pigs', 'illegal', 'Nazi', 'ruling', 'children', 'witness', 'terrible', 'atrocities', 'villagers', 'getting', 'executed', 'worse', 'neighbor', 'named', 'Kluba', 'depicted', 'brutish', 'suspicious', 'son', 'tyrannical', 'bully', 'who', 'off', 'preying', 'Jews', 'who', 'escape', 'trains', 'camps.Through', 'events', 'young', 'Romek', 'desperately', 'understand', 'new', 'world', 'thrust', 'take', 'life', 'village', 'peasant', 'boy', 'However', 'darkness', 'Holocaust', 'increasingly', 'closer', 'Romek', 'events', 'unfolding', 'wholly', 'unexpected', 'shocking', 'manner', 'literally', 'took', 'breath', 'away', 'film', 'rated', 'R', 'are', 'scenes', 'brutality', 'violence', 'including', 'rape', 'scene', 'nevertheless', 'great', 'addition', 'Holocaust', 'film', 'library', 'intend', 'watch', 'again', 'taking', 'things', 'little', 'more', 'slowly', 'time', 'multi-layered', 'film', 'intense', 'dark', 'moments', 'beauty', 'horror', 'seen', 'eyes', 'children']",Edges of the Lord
