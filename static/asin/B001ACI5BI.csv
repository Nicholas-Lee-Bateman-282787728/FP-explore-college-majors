Our youngest still likes to watch it, (even though he knows all of them already), we have a lot of their dvd's, and they still love it.  Very happy with our purchase.  We've had it, now, for 3 years, and the youngest still LOVES it.  He EVEN put more on his Christmas list last year. :)",5,SON LOVES IT!,1382659200,"10 25, 2013",2013,418,"['two', 'younger', 'sons', 'got', 'went', 'Kindergarten', 'SUCH', 'great', 'help', 'simple', 'still', 'attention', 'youngest', 'still', 'watch', 'even', 'already', 'have', 'lot', 'dvd', 'still', 'love', 'Very', 'happy', 'purchase', ""'ve"", 'had', 'now', '3', 'years', 'youngest', 'still', 'LOVES', 'EVEN', 'put', 'more', 'Christmas', 'list', 'last', 'year']",Meet the Sight Words Level
