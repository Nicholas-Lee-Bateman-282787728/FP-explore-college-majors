767469,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,B0000AQS5F,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[5, 7]","The gem on this DVD comedy special is the seasoned comedian Paul Rodriguez.  George Lopez trails second while Cheech Marin's comedy time is confined to introductions only.  You hear very little from him and Cheech wasn't exactly memorable.The first two comedians are just fillers for the evening in El Paso.  Their names aren't on the cover.  These unknowns use unfunny sexual humor that is often received by a limited audience!  Gross sexual humor is overused and not a reflection of a truly great creative comedian.The comedy of George Lopez and Paul Rodriguez is similar is that they both do wonderful bits about their families.  Some of Lopez's scenes are:  ""Mexican Families"", ""Negative Greeting Cards"", and the funny ""Bilingual Fast Food.""Some of the funniest moments come from Rodriguez ""The Chicken's Butt.""  He finally learns that this part was always delegated to him.  Equally hysterical was ""Bad Breath"" about an uncle he says  whose breath is so bad....even on the phone!Some other funny clips are ""Washing Your Father's Car"" and ""Getting Money From the Bank.""As I said, George Lopez is good, but Paul Rodriguez is better!.....MzRizz",4,It is worth it for Paul Rodriguez!!,1088294400,"06 27, 2004",2004,1146,"['gem', 'DVD', 'comedy', 'special', 'seasoned', 'comedian', 'Paul', 'Rodriguez', 'George', 'Lopez', 'second', 'Cheech', 'Marin', 'comedy', 'time', 'confined', 'introductions', 'only', 'hear', 'very', 'little', 'Cheech', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'memorable.The', 'first', 'two', 'comedians', 'are', 'just', 'fillers', 'evening', 'El', 'Paso', 'names', 'are', ""n't"", 'cover', 'unknowns', 'use', 'unfunny', 'sexual', 'humor', 'often', 'received', 'limited', 'audience', 'Gross', 'sexual', 'humor', 'overused', 'not', 'reflection', 'truly', 'great', 'creative', 'comedian.The', 'comedy', 'George', 'Lopez', 'Paul', 'Rodriguez', 'similar', 'do', 'wonderful', 'bits', 'families', 'Lopez', 'scenes', 'are', 'Mexican', 'Families', 'Negative', 'Greeting', 'Cards', 'funny', 'Bilingual', 'Fast', 'Food', 'funniest', 'moments', 'come', 'Rodriguez', 'Chicken', 'Butt', 'finally', 'part', 'was', 'always', 'delegated', 'Equally', 'hysterical', 'was', 'Bad', 'Breath', 'uncle', 'breath', 'so', 'bad', '.even', 'phone', 'other', 'funny', 'clips', 'are', 'Washing', 'Father', 'Car', 'Getting', 'Money', 'Bank', 'said', 'George', 'Lopez', 'good', 'Paul', 'Rodriguez', 'better', '..MzRizz']",N/A

The first two comedians weren't that funny(and their considerd latin kings of comedy). Some laughs now and then but nothing too funny. But when George Lopez came on he saved this DVD. Non stop laughter. This man is truely the funniest Mexicano today(representing my people). Do you have to be Latin to get this. Not really. I showed my friend and he ain't latin but he was dyin when he saw this. The best part is the Jack in the Box skit.""Ask a mexican what kind of fountain drinks do you have"". You have to watch it to get the joke. Paul Rodriguez was ok. Probably the best part in his stand up is when he talks about washing his dad's car. Cheech Marin I was kinda dissapointed. He is very funny but he didn't really show it in here.So this dvd is funny and has good material but I feel they should've gotten more funnier comideans and replace the first two.Carlos Mencia would of been a good choice. If you find yourself laughing hard with this then I check out Why You Crying by George Lopez. It's more funnier stuff and better than this.",4,You member.
