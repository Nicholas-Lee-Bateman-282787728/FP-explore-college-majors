Great series, some episodes better than others of course, but consistently an appealing crime drama with nice scenery.  The mastering is pretty good taken from prints averaging 30 years old.

It is just something that cannot be duplicated, or be updated to modern times where the current dress code is now sloppy as compared to those days when police officers acted like police officers, not some type of special forces and in those days either wore uniforms or at least dress clothes.

Sharp colors, lively music, and a great cast combine to make it a timeless classic.  Like many series, it starts out a bit thin but becomes more and more satisfying with each additional season!  I was concerned that the stories might be too predictable and dated.  Not at all!  The scrips are remarkably complex for their time and would hold up well even in a current-day setting.  Fortunately, these were filmed in the late 1960's and early 1970's, so we can revel in the hair, clothes, make-up, cars, phones, and all the retro furnishings.  I love it that they have to dial the phones, &#34;fire up&#34; the big, clunky, room-sized computer, and rely on old-fashioned police work to solve the crimes.  No graphic blood and guts, no foul language or excessive nudity and sexual situations, no sick psycho villains to endure, just good clean drama and satisfying stories to enjoy.

The characters were real to me and were &#34;cool&#34; because they were developed and at the same time mysterious. If I was in trouble, I wanted someone as strong, tough, caring as Steve McGarrett or Danny Williams or any of the Five-O team to keep me safe or come to the rescue. There was plenty of action without unnecessary gunfire. McGarrett used his brains and the law to keep order and solve crimes.  There was also mystery as you rarely got a look at any of Five-O's personal life. It took a long time to find out that McGarrett or Danny Williams had a personal life and when we finally saw it, it was discreetly portrayed. This series was story driven which does not happen much any more.I realize that times have changed and so has broadcast television. This is not necessarily for the better as far as I am concerned. That is why I am happy to have this collection to view as a reflection of the world situation back when it was originally broadcast, you could almost say a &#34;more innocent&#34; time in America. No violence for violence's sake. No unnecessary explosions.  And the personal lives were not shared. Good was good and evil was evil.

The series, and the team, were named after Hawaii being the 50th state.  Hence a five and a zero.  FIVE-O (with the letter O) makes absolutely no sense. Renaming it FIVE-O to differentiate it from the new series is stupid. Both series are named FIVE-0.Second, as others have noted, the collection is not complete without ""Bored She Hung Herself.""  (There is no actual comma in the title.) Yes, there are legalities preventing it from being released but the episode itself is harmless enough despite its history of allegedly causing a death.  On the other hand, it is not a particulary good episode and the ending is especially stupid so it's no big loss, but for completeness' sake it should be released.Third, yes, the 1997 pilot should be included because it continues the plotline of the original series (even though it somehow brings Chin Ho back to life, but this is not the first time this sort of thing has happened in fiction.) Also I would have liked to have seen the two-part version of the original pilot (""Cocoon"") as broadcast by CBS in the spring/summer of 1969. The opening/closing credits and the editing were closer to the first-season episodes rather than a separate movie.Also, the pilot of the new Hawaii Five-0 could have been added to allow viewers to see that if they hadn't already.  Not only could they fit all the pilots (1969 part 1, 1969 part 2, 1997, 2010) on a special pilot DVD disc but it may have encouraged some viewers to buy the new series on DVD as well.",3,"OK, but not great.",1376092800,"08 10, 2013",2013,1603,"['First', 'title', 'series', 'was', 'ALWAYS', 'will', 'be', 'true', 'fan', 'knows', 'HAWAII', 'FIVE-0', 'zero', 'series', 'team', 'were', 'named', 'Hawaii', 'being', '50th', 'state', 'Hence', 'five', 'zero', 'FIVE-O', 'letter', 'O', 'absolutely', 'sense', 'Renaming', 'FIVE-O', 'differentiate', 'new', 'series', 'stupid', 'series', 'are', 'named', 'FIVE-0.Second', 'others', 'have', 'noted', 'collection', 'not', 'complete', 'Bored', 'Hung', 'actual', 'comma', 'title', 'Yes', 'are', 'legalities', 'preventing', 'being', 'released', 'episode', 'harmless', 'enough', 'history', 'allegedly', 'causing', 'death', 'other', 'hand', 'not', 'particulary', 'good', 'episode', 'ending', 'especially', 'stupid', 'big', 'loss', 'completeness', 'sake', 'should', 'be', 'released.Third', 'yes', '1997', 'pilot', 'should', 'be', 'included', 'plotline', 'original', 'series', 'even', 'somehow', 'Chin', 'Ho', 'back', 'life', 'not', 'first', 'time', 'sort', 'thing', 'happened', 'fiction', 'Also', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'two-part', 'version', 'original', 'pilot', 'Cocoon', 'broadcast', 'CBS', 'spring/summer', '1969', 'opening/closing', 'credits', 'editing', 'were', 'closer', 'first-season', 'episodes', 'rather', 'separate', 'movie.Also', 'pilot', 'new', 'Hawaii', 'Five-0', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'added', 'allow', 'viewers', 'see', 'had', ""n't"", 'already', 'Not', 'only', 'could', 'fit', 'pilots', '1969', 'part', '1', '1969', 'part', '2', '1997', '2010', 'special', 'pilot', 'DVD', 'disc', 'may', 'have', 'encouraged', 'viewers', 'buy', 'new', 'series', 'DVD', 'as', 'well']",Hawaii Five-O: The Complete Original Series
