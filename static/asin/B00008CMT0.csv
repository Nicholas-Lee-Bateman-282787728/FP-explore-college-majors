Grant McLaine plays the accordion to entertain people. He was blacklisted by the powerful railroads. There is conflict between the wives and the hostesses. The conflict escalates. Mining goes on in the hills. A man on a horse chases a young boy, Grant gets involved. The conversations tell about the characters. Ben Kimball is in his private railroad car. There is a plan to avoid another payroll robbery. Can Grant be trusted? The train runs along the hills of Colorado following the river (level ground). The path had to be blasted from the sides of the mountain.The band of outlaws have a hideout in a ghost town. They wait to rob the payroll train. There is conflict over strategy. Whitey abducts Kimball's wife for ransom as there is no payroll. They take Joey too. Will the workers leave without their pay? Grant McLaine infiltrates the outlaw camp, then resolves his conflict with Concho. The brothers have conflicting principles. [Singing in a crime story?] Then a new man shows up and the fight starts. There is a chase and shooting. Will somebody help Grant? The conflict is ironed out by the usual means in this western morality tale.Note how the ""Theatrical Trailer"" shows carefully edited scenes.

But Jimmy Stewart is a name that should absolutely come to mind every time.  Stewart sits his horse well, is believable in hat, boots and spurs, and seems more believable as the consummate good guy of the west.NIGHT PASSAGE, the story of a shamed railroad troubleshooter who is out to redeem his name and his younger brother who has gone bad (Audie Murphy), showcases Stewart's considerable acting abilities very well.And it's a musical western to boot! With toe-tappers like ""You Can't Get Far Without a Railroad"" and ""Follow the River"" both sung by none other than Jimmy Stewart, and a striking soundtrack that beautifully complements the mountains and skies that form the backdrop for this one and you've got nothing short of a very enjoyable western.No, this isn't a western of the predictable genre but it's a breath of fresh air when all you've had is the bacon and beans set for your last ten western viewings.

But this one does have an interesting curiosity value.James Stewart plays Grant McLaine, who is hired to get the payroll through to the end of the line in spite of the last three payrolls being robbed. They even know who the gang is, but there is a fink that tells them when the payroll is coming through, and they always manage to grab it.The curiosity value? Audie Murphy plays the Utica Kid, the fastest gun in the robber gang and challenger of the leader. He is also McLaine's kid brother. Do you know who Audie Murphy was? He was the most decorated American soldier in World War II, and a heck of a good-looking guy. He had a successful movie career before he died in a plane crash in 1971.Of course, all's well that ends well: McLaine gets the payroll through and also gets the pretty girl. I'll give it two stars for the screenplay script, and one for having Murphy and Stewart as brothers.

If you are a movie buff, you'll maybe remember in a few years two or three scenes of the film like the verbal duels between Audie Murphy and Dan Duryea or James Stewart singing with his accordion but that's about all, I'm afraid. I now understand why Anthony Mann left this production after the first day of shooting.Many characters of NIGHT PASSAGE don't have any consistency at all. For instance, can someone tell me what's the exact function of Miss Vittles, the old lady with the jennies, in the film apart of saying hello to James Stewart and indicating him a shortcut through the mountain. And Charlotte Drew, is she in love with James Stewart or Audie Murphy ? And what are the psychological motivations of Verna Kimball ? And ... so on.I say it again, this is not director James Neilson's fault if NIGHT PASSAGE is nothing else than an average western. Neilson filmed the Colorado sceneries with professionalism and humbleness, NIGHT PASSAGE was his first movie and he dedicated most of his career to television afterwards. No, it's entirely due to the script's weakness.

738035,A1JWSDDIH5Z7DV,B00008CMT0,D. R. Schryer,"[12, 13]","A lot of people seem to dismiss Jimmy Stewart as a serious western actor because of the good-natured ""aw shucks"" style he conveyed in the movies he made prior to World War II. But Stewart served in WW II in the dangerous role of a bomber pilot, and the experience clearly toughened the image he portrayed in the series of westerns he made after the war. Night Passage is a very good western and the role Stewart portrays is far tougher than the amiable character he played in the pre-war comedic western Destry Rides Again. Another thing I like about Night Passage is that it features a fine performance, as Stewart's outlaw brother, by Audie Murphy -- WW II's most decorated soldier, and a much better actor than the B movies he most often appeared in gave him a chance to show. Still another interesting aspect of Night Passage is a significant role for Brandon de Wilde -- a fine young actor who, regrettably, is all but forgotten except for his role as the boy Joey in Shane. Then there's Dan Duryea in an over-the-top performance as the ruthless leader of a band of train robbers. For some reason Night Passage has never achieved the recognition it's script, cast, and performances deserve. I hope its release on DVD will help cure this oversight.

Night Passage was scheduled to be the sixth collaboration, until Mann pulled out because he considered the script sucked. Stewart stayed on purely because he got the chance to play the piano accordian and sing - which he does ad nauseum throughout the film (even in the bad guys hideout - and to make matters worse they all cluster around him in classic movie musical style!). It's only about five minutes into the film when you can see why Mann pulled out.  There's none of the same intensity of his other westerns. It meanders along, with too many comic/cute/miusical asides. The usually reliable Dan Duryea fumbles his role of the head of the outlaws (it's as if he was briefed that the film was a comedy), so there's no strong villain to offset the heroes and thereby create tension.  On the plus side, there's some stunning mountain scenery beautifully captured in this widescreen print, and we do have those two villainous western stallwarts, Robert Wilkie and Jack Elam along for the ride.

Grant McLaine (Stewart) is out of work & reduced to playing an accordion (Yes, that's him playing it) for tips. He's been out of work for five years since the railroad has fired him, the same one that he plays the accordion in the at the end-of-tracks camp. The railroad workers are about to quit because the payroll has been stolen three times in a row & they haven't been paid. McLaine is rehired by the railroad to get the payroll to the workers. He had been previously fired because he had let the Utica Kid get away by providing him with a horse & a head start. The truth is the Utica Kid (Audie Murphy) is McLaine's younger brother, Lee. The Utica Kid has hated his older brother since childhood which is his reason for being an outlaw.The movie also has Brandon de Wilde (Shane) as the teen, Joey, who looks up to the Utica Kid. He knows he's no good but he sees him as a good man, mostly because of the rest of the gang Members. Whitey Hardin (Dan Duryea) is the gang leader who is constantly being needled & subtly challenged by the Utica Kid. Their character interplay is fun to watch & could've been expanded on.Murphy's role as the Utica Kid is actually one of the best roles he ever had ,along with The Unforgiven (not the Eastwood movie). He's cast against type portraying the heavy. Murphy didn't venture into the ""A"" list often in his roles; when he did he was usually cast in a featured rather than starring role. Audie Murphy once said he made about 5 or 6 movies & did the same Western about 40 different times. Though he wasn't a great actor, his portrayal of the Utica Kid is more than adequate. It's James Stewart that flexes his acting muscles in this movie. There are a couple of instances in the movie where you can see he almost loses it, the anger almost driving him into a killing rage.

738039,A2ENJGKZZCVNKK,B00008CMT0,"Henry-Clyde ""cLaSsIc MoViE lOvEr AnD bOoK rEaDeR""","[1, 2]","Anthony Mann had directed five excellent Westerns with James Stewart, such as ""WINCHESTER '73"" and ""THE NAKED SPUR"". But after he read the script for ""NIGHT PASSAGE"", he thought that the story and characters were merely copies of his previous Westerns with Stewart, and hired James Neilson to direct. Unfortunately, Neilson focused too much on unconvincing characters, flat dialogue, and a confusing story. However, our story (what there is of it) is of Grant McLaine (Stewart) and his attempts to regain his state of grace in a railroad company after his brother Lee/The Utica Kid (Audie Murphy) robbed the train and Grant let him escape. Now, he has a new assignment, his last chance before they fire him. He must protect the company's money while the train travels through the area that is the territory of outlaw Whitey Harbin (Dan Duryea), who happens to have The Utica Kid as one of his gang members. Along the way, Stewart makes a particular enemy with Concho (Robert Wilke), and friends with Charlotte ""Charlie"" Drew (Dianne Foster) and Joey (Brandon De Wilde).As promising as it all may seem, the film tries much more than necessary. Therefore, many characters are potentially useless, such as Miss Vittles (Olive Carey) and Verna Kimball (Elaine Stewart). Even the better actors, such as Stewart and Flippen, seem to be forced. None of the characters seem to have much heart or personality. The main story winds around and around, never leaving us with anything special to remember. However, the film does have its advantages, such as in the generous cast, the widescreen photography, the immense locations and scenery, some great action pieces, and last but not least, the dashed hopes of what might have been. I always have sympathy for films that mean well, but are not received kindly, such as this one. I can assure you that everyone involved wanted it to be a great Western, and it's a pity that it did not end up as one.SPECIAL FEATURESTheatrical TrailerAlso Recommended: ""WINCHESTER '73"" (1950), ""BEND OF THE RIVER"" (1952), ""THE NAKED SPUR"" (1953), ""THE FAR COUNTRY"" (1954), ""THE MAN FROM LARAMIE"" (1955)THIS REVIEW IS DEDICATED TO ANYBODY, LIVING OR DEAD, INVOLVED IN THE  MAKING OF ""NIGHT PASSAGE"".",4,"Forced characterizations, almost no conviction",1203552000,"02 21, 2008",2008,2218,"['Anthony', 'Mann', 'had', 'directed', 'five', 'excellent', 'Westerns', 'James', 'Stewart', 'such', 'WINCHESTER', ""'73"", 'THE', 'NAKED', 'SPUR', 'read', 'script', 'NIGHT', 'PASSAGE', 'thought', 'story', 'characters', 'were', 'merely', 'copies', 'previous', 'Westerns', 'Stewart', 'hired', 'James', 'Neilson', 'direct', 'Unfortunately', 'Neilson', 'focused', 'too', 'much', 'unconvincing', 'characters', 'flat', 'dialogue', 'confusing', 'story', 'However', 'story', 'what', 'Grant', 'McLaine', 'Stewart', 'attempts', 'regain', 'state', 'grace', 'railroad', 'company', 'brother', 'Lee/The', 'Utica', 'Kid', 'Audie', 'Murphy', 'robbed', 'train', 'Grant', 'let', 'escape', 'Now', 'new', 'assignment', 'last', 'chance', 'fire', 'must', 'protect', 'company', 'money', 'train', 'travels', 'area', 'territory', 'outlaw', 'Whitey', 'Harbin', 'Dan', 'Duryea', 'who', 'have', 'Utica', 'Kid', 'one', 'gang', 'members', 'way', 'Stewart', 'particular', 'enemy', 'Concho', 'Robert', 'Wilke', 'friends', 'Charlotte', 'Charlie', 'Drew', 'Dianne', 'Foster', 'Joey', 'Brandon', 'De', 'Wilde', '.As', 'promising', 'may', 'seem', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'necessary', 'Therefore', 'many', 'characters', 'are', 'potentially', 'useless', 'such', 'Miss', 'Vittles', 'Olive', 'Carey', 'Verna', 'Kimball', 'Elaine', 'Stewart', 'Even', 'better', 'actors', 'such', 'Stewart', 'Flippen', 'seem', 'be', 'forced', 'None', 'characters', 'seem', 'have', 'much', 'heart', 'personality', 'main', 'story', 'winds', 'never', 'leaving', 'anything', 'special', 'remember', 'However', 'film', 'have', 'advantages', 'such', 'generous', 'cast', 'widescreen', 'photography', 'immense', 'locations', 'scenery', 'great', 'action', 'pieces', 'last', 'not', 'least', 'dashed', 'hopes', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'always', 'have', 'sympathy', 'films', 'mean', 'well', 'are', 'not', 'received', 'kindly', 'such', 'one', 'can', 'assure', 'everyone', 'involved', 'wanted', 'be', 'great', 'Western', 'pity', 'did', 'not', 'end', 'up', 'one.SPECIAL', 'FEATURESTheatrical', 'TrailerAlso', 'Recommended', 'WINCHESTER', ""'73"", '1950', 'BEND', 'THE', 'RIVER', '1952', 'NAKED', 'SPUR', '1953', 'FAR', 'COUNTRY', '1954', 'MAN', 'FROM', 'LARAMIE', '1955', 'THIS', 'REVIEW', 'IS', 'DEDICATED', 'TO', 'ANYBODY', 'LIVING', 'OR', 'DEAD', 'INVOLVED', 'IN', 'THE', 'MAKING', 'OF', 'NIGHT', 'PASSAGE']",N/A

After spending five years wandering the west and earning his living playing the accordion, he is given a second chance by his former boss. The train has been robbed several times by Whitey Harbin (Dan Duryea), the Utica Kid and their gang.This film is like a wonderful meal that is full of both contrasts and surprises. There's the obvious contrast between MacLaine and the Utica Kid of good vs. bad and older vs. younger. In addition, Whitey is nervous and constantly on edge while the Kid is calm and collected. MacLaine's former loves are also a contrast. Verna, a blonde, chose an older and wealthier man over MacLaine preferring security to romance, and Charlotte, a brunette, has chosen the younger and wilder Utica Kid over MacLaine.Among the surprises, the film features two wonderful songs, a beautiful romantic ballad ""Follow the River"" and a lively jig ""You can't get far without a railroad."" Stewart plays the accordion and sings the latter song. And the photography is gorgeous.There is a lot to like in the film.

It has gunfights, horses, fistfights, ghost towns, abandon mining claims, et.al., yet it also has an interesting conterpoint of 'good' brother versus 'bad'. From the other mixed reviews here a reader can get most of the formulaic western plot, but the scenery and the solid acting may not come through.I personally like Jimmy Stewart westerns, and Audie Murphy too, and it is a rare chance to see Elaine Stewart. But one of the scene stealers is Dan Duryea a parennial 'baddie', black hat supporting actor. If he is the typical actor, he probably was nothing like that in life. The songs and music are pretty much second rate B movie stuff, however, the one song, You Can't Get Far Without A Railroad will have most people tapping their toes as do both Stewart and Murphy in the ghost town sequence.This movie having railroad building as a background does not go as deeply into the actual historical building as some other Hollywood movies do, but take a look at the supporting actors in the big dance scene, quite a few prominent actors/actresses show up. The movie is stocked with fairly well known actors throughout.For most people this western will entertain, and for those of us who also read westerns as well as watch them, the names Norman A. Fox, who wrote the book from which the movie was taken, and Borden Chase screen story writer and at times short story writer for The Saturday Evening Post, ensures a good, enjoyable but atypical western story.Good watching and good entertainment in a change-of-pace western.

Evered,"[3, 4]","NIGHT PASSAGE (1957) this should have been another classic collaboration for James Stewart and Anthony Mann, following their acclaimed work on five westerns from WINCHESTER 73 (1950) to THE MAN FROM LARAMIE (1955). But they sadly fell out at the pre-production stage. Mann who was scheduled to direct wasn't too happy with the Bordan Chase script, of a story by Norman A Fox. But Stewart was desperate to do it for several reasons not least that it gave him the opportunity to do a lot of accordion playing, an instrument that he had learnt to play as a youngster.Whatever the rights or wrongs of it Stewart pressed on with the film despite every ones advice perhaps not least because he had a stubborn streak running through him like many of his western personas. The new first-time director was James Neilson and many of the cast included those seen in the aforementioned five westerns like Dan Duryea Jay C Flippen, Jack Elam, Robert J. Wilke and others. Also drafted in were Brandon de Wilde (SHANE), Olive Carey (THE SEARCHERS) and last but not least the boyish-looking 32 year-old Audie Murphy who played Stewart's younger brother known as the Utica KidThe story is basically of an itinerant-musician and erstwhile railroad detective Grant McLaine (Stewart) who had been wrongly accused of an earlier robbery was given one final chance to redeem himself by rail boss Ben Kinball (Flippen) to get the long-overdue payroll up to the railhead, in between is a manic Whitey Harbin (Duryea) and his gang, plus the on-the-fringe Utica Kid (Murphy) trying to stop him.Much of the film was shot at around 9000 feet The film was shot in the rarefied atmosphere about 90 minutes drive away from Durango Colorado at times 8000 to 9000 feet above sea level, this made for exhausting work for all involved. William H Daniels was the cinematographer and Clifford Stine was responsible for the Special camera work, I assume that this included the stunning photography following the train along the river and up into the mountains?This DVD is in the original Technirama widescreen aspect and it certainly gives the film at times an almost 3D quality to it. Also included here is the original theatre trailer -- At the time of writing this film is nearly fifty years old and has survived the test of time probably better than many of its critics of the day gave it on its release. -- No. This isn't a Classic Mann Stewart Western, but is still well worth watching if for the splendid photography and to compare those two ""REAL"" WW2 American hero's  Stewart and Murphy close up.

738055,A3BMRSE8N1858V,B00008CMT0,Terence Allen,"[23, 24]","Night Passage was the movie that ended the partnership of actor James Stewart and director Anthony Mann. Their classic Westerns, such as Winchester '73, The Man From Laramie, and of course, The Naked Spur, were all classic Westerns with gritty,edgy performances by Stewart.But Stewart and Mann parted ways on this script involving a disgraced railroad detective who tries to redeem himself by capturing a group of train robbers. Maybe it was the fact that Stewart would sing and play the accordion in the film. Maybe it was the fact that Dan Duryea's character was suspiciously like his role in Winchester '73.At any rate, this film is still a treat and an delight. Stewart plays a character very much like his Mann films, and Audie Murphy gives one of his better performances as the Utica Kid, one of Duryea's gang member, and someone who shares a secret with Stewart. And Duryea plays his part with gusto.Western fans of the Mann/Stewart films should enjoy this film, regardless of the similarities, or even the differences between those films and Night Passage.",4,Solid Stewart Western Holds Up Nicely,1161907200,"10 27, 2006",2006,1064,"['Night', 'Passage', 'was', 'movie', 'ended', 'partnership', 'actor', 'James', 'Stewart', 'director', 'Anthony', 'Mann', 'classic', 'Westerns', 'such', 'Winchester', ""'73"", 'Man', 'From', 'Laramie', 'course', 'Naked', 'Spur', 'were', 'classic', 'Westerns', 'gritty', 'edgy', 'performances', 'Stewart.But', 'Stewart', 'Mann', 'parted', 'ways', 'script', 'involving', 'disgraced', 'railroad', 'detective', 'who', 'redeem', 'capturing', 'group', 'train', 'robbers', 'Maybe', 'was', 'fact', 'Stewart', 'would', 'sing', 'play', 'accordion', 'film', 'Maybe', 'was', 'fact', 'Dan', 'Duryea', 'character', 'was', 'suspiciously', 'role', 'Winchester', 'rate', 'film', 'still', 'treat', 'delight', 'Stewart', 'character', 'very', 'much', 'Mann', 'films', 'Audie', 'Murphy', 'one', 'better', 'performances', 'Utica', 'Kid', 'one', 'Duryea', 'gang', 'member', 'someone', 'who', 'shares', 'secret', 'Stewart', 'Duryea', 'part', 'gusto.Western', 'fans', 'Mann/Stewart', 'films', 'should', 'enjoy', 'film', 'regardless', 'similarities', 'even', 'differences', 'films', 'Night', 'Passage']",N/A
