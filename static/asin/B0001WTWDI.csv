Not since `Lars and the Real Girl' have I felt this way about a quirky independent film where you fall in love with the characters and marvel at the warmth and eccentricity they elicit.The movie starts with Finbar McBride (Peter Dinklage, `In Bruges') a dwarf (at least that's the term he prefers, so I'll go along with him) who works as a fix-it man at a used goods store.  Despite the tool man position, he's sharply dressed with a collared shirt and tie.  His moves are mundane, and the store's atmosphere is serene and quiet.  The deliberations of his life are similar.  He goes shopping.  He lives alone.  He doesn't have any companionship, and whatever entertainment he ekes out is spent by himself.  Then the owner of the shop (Paul Benjamin) dies.Soon Finbar learns that he's inherited a train station depot from his deceased employer.  The shop is sold with its merchandise, so he pursues his newfound possession, nestled in a sleepy New Jersey neighborhood where much renovation is needed .He's able to live in the station depot where in former times the thriving railroad stop provided a barber shop and a familiar store with convenience items.  (Although the trains that go through every night make sleep difficult.) Within a few yards of him is Joe Oramas (Bobby Cannavale, `Romance & Cigarettes') a Latino who runs his ailing father's hot dog and coffee vending stand from a trailer.  Joey is gregarious and friendly with his new neighbor.  His overtures, however, fall flat on the taciturn Finbar whose silence speaks volumes about the ordeals he endures about his height.The two get caught up as a threesome when a separated housewife, Olivia Harris  (Patricia Clarkson `Lars and the Real Girl') nearly runs Finbar over on the road juggling with the distracted driver syndrome we're all used to.  Trying to make it up to him, Olivia  finds a social context in which all three can get involved together.  Finbar finally opens up.  Eventually, they each have something to give one another, and the tripod becomes more complete with four when Finbar becomes infatuated with the local librarian (Michelle Williams) and extends to five when Cleo (Raven Goodwin), a curious and precocious African-American girl, shares his company and fascination about trains.The differences between the three characters is so clever, yet uncanny, you can hardly believe how well their chemistry works together.  Whether gathering at Olivia's house and art gallery, going train chasing with two amateur filmmakers whose heights are at a great distance, or just sharing a meal, the movie gels with unusual sparkle and grace.The film demonstrates that in the midst of the usual hustle and bustle a dwarf will especially be treated like he's invisible target and in the way.  But they all have hurdles to leap over.  In Olivia's split marriage arrangement some past secrets come creeping back into her life, and Joey's outgoing vivacity has little time and space when caring for a sick father.Colorful, charming, and engaging `The Station Agent' is one of those gems that make you wish independent movies were always this good.

While being very welcoming it doesn't contain much dialogue.  The dialogue that it contains is very short and brief.  I'm not sure if that's the influence of the main character, or simply because the screenwriter is ADD.  Ultimately, none of this matters because the film is really about the main character and showing his situation.  As that, it succeeds very well and it doesn't attempt to be charming at all, which is a positive.

Film buffs remember Dinklage's scene-stealing debut in 'Living in Oblivion.'  If you've seen Dinklage out of character on TV, you've seen what a lively, chatty guy he can be.  So, his turn here as an introspective man of few words represents a nice stretch of acting.  My top praise goes to Bobby Cannavale.  He's such an engaging screen presence.  His 'likability' quotient is off the charts.  The second you see Cannavale, a smile will start to form on your lips.  He's a joy to watch.

Haviland Jr. ""AirshowFan""","[1, 14]","While Peter Dinklage does an excellent job acting in the role of Finnbar McBride, a dwarf who is fascinated with trains, some unlikely events in the film detract. When Finn is leaving Hoboken to go to Newfoundland, 35 niles away, he walks along the busy NJ Transit tracks. A true railfan would not trespass like that and no tracks go directly from Hoboken to Newfoundland. While it would be possible to go through Hawthorne, NJ to get to the Susquehanna tracks that lead to Newfoundland, it would not be a route that someone could walk without getting arrested. Once he gets to Newfoundland, his interactions with Joe and Olivia are credible and his resistance to appear in front of Cleo's school class is understandable. After Finn gets drunk in the bar and is walking home on the tracks, he is run over by a train but survives, another unlikely event. If Finn had simply taken a bus from Hoboken (or the Port Authority bus terminal in NY) to Newfoundland, this film would have had a better beginning. Despite his determination to live in isolation, Finn discovers that people will not let this happen. Patricia Clarkson portrays her role of Olivia well and she helps this movie to the three stars. Bobby Cannavale is credible as Joe Oramas. If you are a railfan and looking for some train photos, there are a few of NJ Transit trains in the beginning of the film and Susquehanna RR trains in Newfoundland but they are brief.

Whitehead ""Werthead""","[2, 2]","I picked up this movie on DVD a while ago as it had good reviews and was very cheap (it's currently about 4 on Amazon.co.uk), but I'd never gotten round to watching it. When I heard that its director, Tom McCarthy, and one of its stars, Peter Dinklage, had been signed up for HBO's adaption of George RR Martin's novel A Game of Thrones, it seemed like a good time to give it a go.The plot is reasonably straightforward. Dinklage plays Fin, a young man suffering from dwarfism. Tired of having people comment on his height, Fin is a withdrawn man who seeks solace in his hobby of studying trains and his job working in a model train shop with his friend Henry. When Henry dies unexpectedly, Fin inherits a piece of property, an old train depot in Newfoundland, New Jersey, and moves in, hoping to continue his life of solitude.Fin soon finds himself uncomfortably drawn into the lives of several other people. Joe is a garrulous, friendly guy running the local ice cream van on behalf of his father, who is ill. A local woman, Olivia, almost accidentally runs Fin over and in her attempts to make amends they form an interesting friendship. A somewhat less-developed storyline sees Fin attract the attention of Emily, the local young librarian, who is having her own problems.The Station Agent is a curious movie, which for most of its length seems to be heading down the 'heartwarming relationship drama' route before the director suddenly veers away from the threat of cliche city into a new and more interesting direction. It's a short movie (only 90 minutes) but it has a laidback pace, focusing on the characters, dialogue and their slowly building relationships in a well-developed manner. As well as Dinklage in an outstanding role, Patricia Clarkson as Olivia and Bobby Cannavale give excellent performances as Patricia and Joe, the former playing a badly damaged character and the latter being that slightly overbearing, slightly too friendly type of person I think most people have met at some point in their lives. Michelle Williams has a much slighter role as Emily but makes the most of her scenes.The late-stage shift in the narrative is an interesting move. Without giving away spoilers, the way that McCarthy avoids corny resolutions to the character arcs and deftly subverts expectations of a neat ending is well-done. He doesn't go bonkers and kill everyone or turn one of the characters into a psychopath, but he also doesn't go down the totally corny route either. It's a thought-provoking way of concluding the film that works well, although it took me a while to get into its headspace.The Station Agent (****) is a quiet, funny, entertaining and occasionally emotionally intense movie that is well worth a watch. As a piece of character drama, it is a rousing success and fills me with great hope for the HBO project.",4,A well-done character piece,1242000000,"05 11, 2009",2009,2840,"['picked', 'up', 'movie', 'DVD', 'while', 'ago', 'had', 'good', 'reviews', 'was', 'very', 'cheap', 'currently', '4', 'Amazon.co.uk', ""'d"", 'never', 'gotten', 'round', 'watching', 'When', 'heard', 'director', 'Tom', 'McCarthy', 'one', 'stars', 'Peter', 'Dinklage', 'had', 'been', 'signed', 'up', 'HBO', 'adaption', 'George', 'RR', 'Martin', 'novel', 'A', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'seemed', 'good', 'time', 'give', 'go.The', 'plot', 'reasonably', 'straightforward', 'Dinklage', 'Fin', 'young', 'man', 'suffering', 'dwarfism', 'Tired', 'having', 'people', 'comment', 'height', 'Fin', 'withdrawn', 'man', 'who', 'solace', 'hobby', 'studying', 'trains', 'job', 'working', 'model', 'train', 'shop', 'friend', 'Henry', 'When', 'Henry', 'unexpectedly', 'Fin', 'piece', 'property', 'old', 'train', 'depot', 'Newfoundland', 'New', 'Jersey', 'moves', 'hoping', 'continue', 'life', 'solitude.Fin', 'soon', 'uncomfortably', 'drawn', 'lives', 'several', 'other', 'people', 'Joe', 'garrulous', 'friendly', 'guy', 'running', 'local', 'ice', 'cream', 'van', 'behalf', 'father', 'who', 'ill.', 'A', 'local', 'woman', 'Olivia', 'almost', 'accidentally', 'Fin', 'attempts', 'make', 'amends', 'form', 'interesting', 'friendship', 'somewhat', 'less-developed', 'storyline', 'sees', 'Fin', 'attract', 'attention', 'Emily', 'local', 'young', 'librarian', 'who', 'having', 'own', 'problems.The', 'Station', 'Agent', 'curious', 'movie', 'most', 'length', 'be', 'heading', ""'heartwarming"", 'relationship', 'drama', 'route', 'director', 'suddenly', 'away', 'threat', 'cliche', 'city', 'new', 'more', 'interesting', 'direction', 'short', 'movie', 'only', '90', 'minutes', 'laidback', 'pace', 'focusing', 'characters', 'dialogue', 'slowly', 'building', 'relationships', 'well-developed', 'manner', 'As', 'well', 'Dinklage', 'outstanding', 'role', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'Olivia', 'Bobby', 'Cannavale', 'give', 'excellent', 'performances', 'Patricia', 'Joe', 'former', 'playing', 'badly', 'damaged', 'character', 'latter', 'being', 'slightly', 'overbearing', 'slightly', 'too', 'friendly', 'type', 'person', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'have', 'met', 'point', 'lives', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'much', 'slighter', 'role', 'Emily', 'most', 'scenes.The', 'late-stage', 'shift', 'narrative', 'interesting', 'move', 'giving', 'away', 'spoilers', 'way', 'McCarthy', 'avoids', 'corny', 'resolutions', 'character', 'arcs', 'deftly', 'subverts', 'expectations', 'neat', 'ending', 'well-done', ""n't"", 'go', 'bonkers', 'kill', 'everyone', 'turn', 'one', 'characters', 'psychopath', 'also', ""n't"", 'go', 'down', 'totally', 'corny', 'route', 'thought-provoking', 'way', 'concluding', 'film', 'well', 'took', 'while', 'get', 'headspace.The', 'Station', 'Agent', '****', 'quiet', 'funny', 'entertaining', 'occasionally', 'emotionally', 'intense', 'movie', 'well', 'worth', 'watch', 'piece', 'character', 'drama', 'rousing', 'success', 'fills', 'great', 'hope', 'HBO', 'project']",The Station Agent

815238,AR37967IAR6ZT,B0001WTWDI,Benjamin,"[19, 23]","Tom McCarthy's THE STATION AGENT is about a man who likes trains far more than he likes people. He just wants to sit and read, walk along the train tracks watching locomotives pass and keep to himself. He doesn't think there's really much particularly interesting about his manner, and he doesn't really have much need for friends or attention.But Fin was born a dwarf, which is likely what motivates him to remain isolated and what motivates gawkers, jarringly rude people and sentimental souls to take an interest.At the beginning of THE STATION AGENT, we see Fin, brilliantly played by the talented and actually quite handsome Peter Dinklage, go about his life amongst a rude population until his sole friend in the world dies. Though Fin is sad, of course, he inherits land with an old, isolated train depot on it - and he ventures to it so that he can finally live without bother from other people.But like it does with all of us sometimes, the world will just not leave Fin alone - no matter how much he craves silence and isolation.Fate, I guess, knows that Fin needs people, needs friendships, needs ties to the outside world, so it provides him with new friends Joe and Olivia, played by Bobby Cannavale and the always-excellent Patricia Clarkson. Joe runs his father's catering van that he parks everyday outside the train station, even though it barely gets any traffic and Joe himself cannot stand being alone because he can't stop talking. Olivia is a perpetually distracted artist who lives in a nearby house and comes by Joe's stand and the station everyday because they're her only real connection to the outside world.Because they ask Fin more about his interests and his life than about his condition, he finds himself opening up to them.Through Joe and Olivia, who is masking some very real problems of her own, Fin is able to change his life. Somewhat. And the story of these friendships and these unique characters are what give THE STATION AGENT its considerable charm.I identified with Fin's character personally because I was born with a disability as well. With a disability, you find sometimes that you want people to acknowledge your differences, and other times you'd rather be accepted and not stared at. THE STATION AGENT gives Fin distinct moments when he attempts to either thwart attention or grab it, not sure of how he himself feels toward what makes him physically different. It's a smart film that can do that, that can allow a character to both embrace and fight against adversity at the same time.Because that compromise is difficult in life, the film ends on an ambivalent note, but with one of hope, and I found that fitting.I recommend it because it knows what its character is going through, knows why he's going through it and knows that there are no easy answers to his situation.It also knows that sometimes you just shouldn't be alone.",4,Fin McBride just wants to be alone.,1098057600,"10 18, 2004",2004,2882,"['Tom', 'McCarthy', 'THE', 'STATION', 'AGENT', 'man', 'who', 'trains', 'far', 'more', 'people', 'just', 'sit', 'read', 'walk', 'train', 'tracks', 'watching', 'locomotives', 'pass', 'keep', ""n't"", 'think', 'really', 'much', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'manner', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'much', 'need', 'friends', 'attention.But', 'Fin', 'was', 'born', 'dwarf', 'likely', 'what', 'remain', 'isolated', 'what', 'gawkers', 'jarringly', 'rude', 'people', 'sentimental', 'souls', 'take', 'interest.At', 'beginning', 'THE', 'STATION', 'AGENT', 'see', 'Fin', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'talented', 'actually', 'quite', 'handsome', 'Peter', 'Dinklage', 'go', 'life', 'rude', 'population', 'sole', 'friend', 'world', 'Fin', 'sad', 'course', 'land', 'old', 'isolated', 'train', 'depot', 'ventures', 'so', 'can', 'finally', 'live', 'bother', 'other', 'people.But', 'sometimes', 'world', 'will', 'just', 'not', 'leave', 'Fin', 'alone', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'silence', 'isolation.Fate', 'guess', 'Fin', 'people', 'friendships', 'ties', 'outside', 'world', 'new', 'friends', 'Joe', 'Olivia', 'played', 'Bobby', 'Cannavale', 'always-excellent', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'Joe', 'father', 'catering', 'van', 'everyday', 'train', 'station', 'even', 'barely', 'traffic', 'Joe', 'can', 'not', 'stand', 'being', 'alone', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'talking', 'Olivia', 'perpetually', 'distracted', 'artist', 'who', 'nearby', 'house', 'Joe', 'stand', 'station', 'everyday', ""'re"", 'only', 'real', 'connection', 'outside', 'world.Because', 'ask', 'Fin', 'more', 'interests', 'life', 'condition', 'opening', 'up', 'Joe', 'Olivia', 'who', 'masking', 'very', 'real', 'problems', 'own', 'Fin', 'able', 'change', 'life', 'Somewhat', 'story', 'friendships', 'unique', 'characters', 'are', 'what', 'give', 'STATION', 'AGENT', 'considerable', 'charm.I', 'identified', 'Fin', 'character', 'personally', 'was', 'born', 'disability', 'as', 'well', 'disability', 'find', 'sometimes', 'want', 'people', 'acknowledge', 'differences', 'other', 'times', ""'d"", 'rather', 'be', 'accepted', 'not', 'stared', 'STATION', 'AGENT', 'Fin', 'distinct', 'moments', 'when', 'thwart', 'attention', 'grab', 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'what', 'physically', 'different', 'smart', 'film', 'can', 'do', 'can', 'allow', 'character', 'embrace', 'fight', 'adversity', 'same', 'time.Because', 'compromise', 'difficult', 'life', 'film', 'ambivalent', 'note', 'one', 'hope', 'found', 'fitting.I', 'recommend', 'what', 'character', 'going', 'why', 'going', 'are', 'easy', 'answers', 'situation.It', 'also', 'sometimes', 'just', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'alone']",The Station Agent

This is that kind of movie and its wonderful because the acting is so seamless that you literally forget you are watching men and women playing a part. Instead you are watching real characters come to life.And I think because the director allowed stillness and quiet reflection to speak, that the movie says so much.  It literally makes the adage a picture says a thousand words a reality. Peter Dinklage becomes the quiet reclusive man in the old no longer used train station, who then opens up.  And the director. writer made his character so real by all the interesting facts about trains and the railroad, which any train buff will love. Even the question about blimps, made me want to look up facts about blimps.The scenery is spectacular and used well. Bobby Cannavale plays the owner of a mobile coffee stand and is someone you might actually know if your live in a small town.  Patricia Clarkson plays an artist who has lost a son and now her marriage and is in a deep deep depression.  The Librarian and other characters are a good addition to the film.The vulnerability of Finbar McBride played by Peter Dinklage, like when the boyfriend of a young woman whom Finbar has befriended starts hitting on her and Finbar steps in and wants him to stop, yet being a dwarf  he cant do much and needs to actually protect himself.Also appreciated this movie because it was thoughtful, mature and didnt resort to nudity, violence and other cheap movie tricks to keep the viewers attention.

Once he thinks Finn is attractive to the ladies, he won't leave him alone. Soon after he meets a mature married woman that has lost a son and has a rocky marriage and likes to paint faces without eyes.

I never got a chance to finish the film, having always been called away or on the go somewhere. I just naturally assumed that this was going to be some dark & overly depressing art flick that I'd regret watching. I was completely wrong.The film follows the character of Fin, a man with dwarfism who prefers to spend most of his time alone. He inherits a train depot in the middle of nowhere from his deceased boss, assuming that nobody will bother him & that he'll be able to enjoy his trains in peace. Once he gets there he discovers that a well-meaning snack truck operator parks his truck outside the train depot & is intent on befriending Fin. Fin also meets the clumsy artist Olivia, who is depressed over the loss of her son years before.I just loved this movie. There's so much to look at in this film & there's so many different ways people could interpret actions made by it's characters. I just really can't say enough good things about this film. Both my mother & I were skeptical that we'd like it, but by the end of the film both of us were saying that we wanted to buy the DVD.If you like action flicks or are looking for something with tons of romance, sex or intrigue, this isn't the film for you. This is very much a slice of life movie. There's no big message in the film, nor is there any touchy feely ""the more you know"".

Kornman,"[3, 5]","Arriving under the dwarfing shadow of the big-budget epics like Matrix: Revolutions, Lord of the Rings: Return of the King, and Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World, sometimes there comes a film that is so refreshingly short, sweet, and simple that it has the power to, well, move you.And yes, I use the word ""dwarf"" deliberately.  He's not a midget.I'll confess, when I saw that the main character in this independent film was of hobbit-like proportions, I feared for the soul of the movie-making world.  I expected Wizard of Oz comical, or Lord of the Rings fantasy.  Or, and I prayed fervently this wouldn't happen, a sermon.  But instead what I got was a miniature enlightenment and some very fine low-budget entertainment.Sweeping the big three at the Sundance Film Festival (Best Film, Best Director, Best Performance) The Station Agent is set in a rural New Jersey town and involves the lives of three desperately different people finding out what it means to interact with each other.  It's touching, painful, hilarious, and most of all, it's real.  The film is soaked from start to finish with the kind of rich characterization you might expect from a P.T. Anderson picture.  Finbar McBride (Peter Dinklage) is a dwarf who, moving to a new community after inheriting property from a deceased friend, deals with the aloneness and self-pity that comes with being a small man in a big world.  Joe Oramas (Bobby Cannavale) is his hot-dog selling, fast-talking, inhibition-free neighbor whose personality is so overbearingly friendly he can't make friends.  And Olivia Harris (Patricia Clarkson) is a divorced painter struggling with depression rooted in her child's death.Writer-Director Thomas McCarthy explores themes of loneliness, friendship, and all the humor and tragedy that come between with such honesty that you frequently find yourself laughing and crying in the very same instant.  It doesn't sugarcoat the pain of relationships, it doesn't make the every-day moments melodramatic, and it doesn't preach... too much.This isn't the film for the part of you that wants an ending with an overwhelmingly passionate romance, a sweeping death scene, or a sense of resolution.  The characters are much the same as when the film started, and though their problems are not fully solved, they are in the process of discovering people outside of themselves.",5,Refreshingly Minimalist,1096502400,"09 30, 2004",2004,2374,"['Arriving', 'dwarfing', 'shadow', 'big-budget', 'epics', 'Matrix', 'Revolutions', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Return', 'King', 'Master', 'Commander', 'Far', 'Side', 'World', 'sometimes', 'film', 'so', 'refreshingly', 'short', 'sweet', 'simple', 'power', 'well', 'move', 'you.And', 'yes', 'use', 'word', 'dwarf', 'deliberately', 'not', 'midget.I', ""'ll"", 'confess', 'when', 'saw', 'main', 'character', 'independent', 'film', 'was', 'hobbit-like', 'proportions', 'feared', 'soul', 'movie-making', 'world', 'expected', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'comical', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'fantasy', 'prayed', 'fervently', 'would', ""n't"", 'happen', 'sermon', 'instead', 'what', 'got', 'was', 'miniature', 'enlightenment', 'very', 'fine', 'low-budget', 'entertainment.Sweeping', 'big', 'three', 'Sundance', 'Film', 'Festival', 'Best', 'Film', 'Best', 'Director', 'Best', 'Performance', 'Station', 'Agent', 'set', 'rural', 'New', 'Jersey', 'town', 'lives', 'three', 'desperately', 'different', 'people', 'finding', 'out', 'what', 'interact', 'other', 'touching', 'painful', 'hilarious', 'most', 'real', 'film', 'soaked', 'start', 'finish', 'kind', 'rich', 'characterization', 'might', 'expect', 'P.T', 'Anderson', 'picture', 'Finbar', 'McBride', 'Peter', 'Dinklage', 'dwarf', 'who', 'moving', 'new', 'community', 'inheriting', 'property', 'deceased', 'friend', 'deals', 'aloneness', 'self-pity', 'being', 'small', 'man', 'big', 'world', 'Joe', 'Oramas', 'Bobby', 'Cannavale', 'hot-dog', 'selling', 'fast-talking', 'inhibition-free', 'neighbor', 'personality', 'so', 'overbearingly', 'friendly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'friends', 'Olivia', 'Harris', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'divorced', 'painter', 'struggling', 'depression', 'rooted', 'child', 'death.Writer-Director', 'Thomas', 'McCarthy', 'themes', 'loneliness', 'friendship', 'humor', 'tragedy', 'such', 'honesty', 'frequently', 'find', 'laughing', 'crying', 'very', 'same', 'instant', ""n't"", 'sugarcoat', 'pain', 'relationships', ""n't"", 'make', 'every-day', 'moments', 'melodramatic', ""n't"", 'preach', 'too', 'much.This', ""n't"", 'film', 'part', 'ending', 'overwhelmingly', 'passionate', 'romance', 'sweeping', 'death', 'scene', 'sense', 'resolution', 'characters', 'are', 'much', 'same', 'when', 'film', 'started', 'problems', 'are', 'not', 'fully', 'solved', 'are', 'process', 'discovering', 'people']",The Station Agent

Dinklage is joined by Joe (Bobby Cannavale) the hot dog and coffee vendor and artist Olivia (Patricia Clarkson). It is in Newfoundland, NJ that Fin inherits an abandoned train depot and begins to build relations with the quirkie town people. If you watch close you can catch Michelle Williamns (from tv--Dawson's Creek) as the librarian.The Station Agent is subtle writing and dialogue that flows smoothly from the well polished actors. Dinklage is impressive in this role as his brooding face coveys the pain and alienation he feels from his height and how people treat him. Clarkson is wonderful as usual with a stunning portrayal of a mother who has a deep loss and is unable to move on with her life; while Cannavale conveys his own lonliness and worry over the health of his sick father. The script and director move all characters into emotional development and you can see how each grows and comes to grips with his or her own pain. The Station Agent definately moves at a slower pace but this is necessary to facilitate the emotional connections that must be made between individuals, which is especially true for Fin who finds himself so isolated.

Finbar inherits an abandoned train depot when his friend Henry, the owner of the model train store where Finbar works, dies.  He goes there to live away from people but ends up gradually befriending several inhabitants of the small community around his depot.  Writer-director Thomas McCarthy and Dinklage do a very good job of portraying Finbar's fear of making himself vulnerable to the kinds of rejection and insult he has endured in the past without resorting to sentimentality.  At times, I almost wished for a little more sentiment, but Finbar is far too dignified to give in to easy emotion.

815323,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0001WTWDI,Ed Uyeshima,"[4, 4]","Writer/director Tom McCarthy has made a most unique character study in 2003's ""The Station Agent"". It's a very quiet, episodic film, only 88 minutes long, but surprisingly assured and often compelling for a first-time filmmaker. It all centers on a dwarf named Fin, who seems rather indifferent about his life, especially after his boss dies and leaves him a train station in the outer reaches of New Jersey. Not so coincidentally, his passion is trains, and he just wants to be left alone to ""walk the right of way"" on the tracks. Of course, he keeps meeting up with people who are drawn to him. The two most prominent are Joe, a boisterous Cuban-American from Manhattan taking care of his ailing father's hot dog stand, and Olivia, a manic-depressive artist caught between her anguish over her son's death and her anger over her separation. There's also a shy little girl named Cleo and a young, friendly librarian, Emily. All of them look beyond Fin's diminutive stature and initial poker-faced demeanor to find him someone worthwhile to know. Consequently the movie feels more like a fable than a realistic portrait of discrimination and isolation. But the approach makes sense since we come to care about Fin's situation in spite of the fanciful fact that he doesn't seem to have any financial worries.It all sounds like the makings of a life-affirming TV-movie, but the methodical pacing and superlative acting transcend the more predictable aspects of the script. Peter Dinklage captures all the emotions that seep out of Fin after a lifetime of relative solitude and pained ridicule. Initially, you wonder why everyone wants to be his friend given his outward surliness, but he conveys the soulfulness that makes this particular plot contrivance believable. TV staple Bobby Cannavale makes Joe so likable with his high energy that you overlook his character's otherwise annoying neediness, and Patricia Clarkson gives her typically stellar performance as Olivia, her barbed intelligence intact, even as her character seems to descend into what appears to be an irretrievably depressive state. The seemingly effortless bonding that occurs among this trio provides the film's chief pleasure. On the sidelines, there are nice, affecting turns by a better-than-expected Michelle Williams as Emily and Raven Goodwin as Cleo. Unfortunately there are also some melodramatic flourishes, such as Fin's drunken assertion at the bar, his hurtful rejection by Olivia and the appearance of Emily's white-trash boyfriend, that don't seem to serve much purpose beyond confirming the fact that Fin needs love and friends. But these scenes don't detract from the obvious affection which McCarthy has for his characters, especially Fin.For a film made on the cheap (less than $500K in twenty days), it has a surprising cinematic feel with all the well-composed train shots, credit going to Oliver Bokelberg's expert camerawork. The DVD package has a nice audio commentary track by McCarthy and his three main actors with Cannavale providing particularly amusing anecdotes. There are five deleted scenes, three that provide more context to the relationship between Fin and his boss and the last one is I believe an alternate ending with the appearance of Joe's much-talked about father.

815324,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B0001WTWDI,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 3]","THE STATION AGENT (2003, 88 minutes) stars New Jersey-born character actor Peter Dinklage as Finbar ""Fin"" McBride, a young man with dwarfism who is also somewhat shy, slightly antisocial and a train fanatic. (Thanks to the intrepid reader who caught my ""mistake"".)When Fin, a New Englander living in ""countryside"" New York, moves into the local abandoned old train station, he encounters two colorful local eccentrics who draw him out after befriending him. Readers will forgive me if I'm not sure where this takes place: I know from the film it seems to be right where New York and New Jersey countryside meet.It seems to me this film introduced Dinklage to America at least--people always fall for his large, soulful eyes and handsome visage. However, Dinklage is a powerful actor when he's allowed to be--here, since he's supposed to be an American he does a lovely, precise American accent without the lightest hint of New York or New Jersey in it. His performance here is really a tour de force.My wife and I saw this film and even though she was a bit lost as to its purpose, I saw right away that it is a film about the life of a 'small person'. I've never seen a movie dealing with the subject and never knew there was a drama like this, really showing the audience rather than lecturing us. When Fin first occupies the station as his home, there's a knock at the door.Dinklage's expression broke my heart: it is of sheer terror, not just a xenophobic reaction but the idea that he's small, people have seen him already and what if that's trouble at the door?--my heart broke because it suddenly occurred to me that life must be like that for small people. It also struck me that small people show incredible bravery just getting on with life. No wonder several famous small people have committed suicide.I wish to note that in my family, in our language, there is only one term for a small person which comes from the Latin. The word literally means ""a small person""--I say this because I'm actually unsure what the correct term is and I wonder why we ought to use any ""term"" at all. Medically if it concerns dwarfism, the individual is called a ""dwarf"". That seems too cruel, but I can't tell why.In the film, a cute little local girl befriends Fin, and asks him if he is a midget. He smiles and says simply, ""No."" A midget, again medically speaking, does not have dwarfism. Later in the film as he is speaking to one of his friends, he says he hated himself for being a dwarf. If you pay attention, Fin himself will explain to you what a ""station agent"" is (or was in the past anyway).This film is slow-paced, lightly humorous and it is no pity party by any means. I think everyone deserved Oscars here. It teaches the audience a lesson that everyone needs. As an original lifelong fan of Billy Barty, and with so many small people living in my area, I only bonded with the character of Fin at first. His dwarfism had to shocking impact on me anymore than the presence of a tall vase of flowers. After all, the tracks are a block away from my home where I grew up and still live--and as I said, many small people choose to live here, or else we have more dwarfism than other places.I love trains as much as Fin, but I don't know a fraction of the things he knows. So the film was something of a pleasant educational shock, because we see in it how the world definitely pretends there are no small people. Many things began whipping at me like the winter wind: how do they cope with public restrooms? Restaurants? Bars? Mailboxes? The world does not seem to hate small people--only it is horribly indifferent to their needs.Co-starring a then-fresh-faced Bobby Cannavale as Fin's goofy Puerto Rican friend and Patricia Clarkson as Olivia, Fin's other friend who has terrible demons of her own. The writer-director is Tom McCarthy, a not-so-well known but very employed actor who has done everything from bit parts on TV to larger parts in big films. His other major credit as director isThe Visitor. He has one other credit as director which I forget.This belongs in a collection, any film lover's collection. Why it has an R-rating is beyond me: it is undeserved and stupid. Often, I get the feeling the R is only meant to show audiences that it isn't a chidlren's film. There is nothing wrong with a well-made children's film!Miramax got the rights to release this but I see other releases here besides their expensive release. This is clearly an indie film, and it appears to have been made with European audiences in mind.Watch this and learn!",5,First one I've ever seen that deals with dwarfism,1382227200,"10 20, 2013",2013,4557,"['STATION', 'AGENT', '2003', '88', 'minutes', 'New', 'Jersey-born', 'character', 'actor', 'Peter', 'Dinklage', 'Finbar', 'Fin', 'McBride', 'young', 'man', 'dwarfism', 'who', 'also', 'somewhat', 'shy', 'slightly', 'antisocial', 'train', 'fanatic', 'Thanks', 'intrepid', 'reader', 'who', 'caught', 'mistake', 'When', 'Fin', 'New', 'Englander', 'living', 'countryside', 'New', 'York', 'local', 'abandoned', 'old', 'train', 'station', 'two', 'colorful', 'local', 'eccentrics', 'who', 'draw', 'out', 'befriending', 'Readers', 'will', 'forgive', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'where', 'place', 'know', 'film', 'be', 'right', 'where', 'New', 'York', 'New', 'Jersey', 'countryside', 'meet.It', 'film', 'introduced', 'Dinklage', 'America', 'least', 'people', 'always', 'fall', 'large', 'soulful', 'eyes', 'handsome', 'visage', 'However', 'Dinklage', 'powerful', 'actor', 'when', 'allowed', 'be', 'here', 'supposed', 'be', 'American', 'lovely', 'precise', 'American', 'accent', 'lightest', 'hint', 'New', 'York', 'New', 'Jersey', 'performance', 'here', 'really', 'tour', 'force.My', 'wife', 'saw', 'film', 'even', 'was', 'bit', 'lost', 'purpose', 'saw', 'right', 'away', 'film', 'life', ""'small"", 'person', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'movie', 'dealing', 'subject', 'never', 'knew', 'was', 'drama', 'really', 'showing', 'audience', 'rather', 'lecturing', 'When', 'Fin', 'first', 'station', 'home', 'knock', 'door.Dinklage', 'expression', 'broke', 'heart', 'sheer', 'terror', 'not', 'just', 'xenophobic', 'reaction', 'idea', 'small', 'people', 'have', 'seen', 'already', 'what', 'trouble', 'door', 'heart', 'broke', 'suddenly', 'occurred', 'life', 'must', 'be', 'small', 'people', 'also', 'struck', 'small', 'people', 'show', 'incredible', 'bravery', 'just', 'getting', 'life', 'wonder', 'several', 'famous', 'small', 'people', 'have', 'committed', 'suicide.I', 'wish', 'note', 'family', 'language', 'only', 'one', 'term', 'small', 'person', 'Latin', 'word', 'literally', 'small', 'person', 'say', ""'m"", 'actually', 'unsure', 'what', 'correct', 'term', 'wonder', 'why', 'ought', 'use', 'term', 'Medically', 'dwarfism', 'individual', 'called', 'dwarf', 'too', 'cruel', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'why.In', 'film', 'cute', 'little', 'local', 'girl', 'befriends', 'Fin', 'midget', 'simply', 'No', 'midget', 'again', 'medically', 'speaking', 'not', 'have', 'dwarfism', 'Later', 'film', 'speaking', 'one', 'friends', 'hated', 'being', 'dwarf', 'pay', 'attention', 'Fin', 'will', 'explain', 'what', 'station', 'agent', 'was', 'past', 'anyway', '.This', 'film', 'slow-paced', 'lightly', 'humorous', 'pity', 'party', 'means', 'think', 'everyone', 'deserved', 'Oscars', 'here', 'audience', 'lesson', 'everyone', 'needs', 'original', 'lifelong', 'fan', 'Billy', 'Barty', 'so', 'many', 'small', 'people', 'living', 'area', 'only', 'bonded', 'character', 'Fin', 'first', 'dwarfism', 'had', 'shocking', 'impact', 'anymore', 'presence', 'tall', 'vase', 'flowers', 'tracks', 'are', 'block', 'away', 'home', 'where', 'grew', 'up', 'still', 'live', 'said', 'many', 'small', 'people', 'choose', 'live', 'here', 'else', 'have', 'more', 'dwarfism', 'other', 'places.I', 'love', 'trains', 'as', 'much', 'Fin', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'fraction', 'things', 'film', 'was', 'something', 'pleasant', 'educational', 'shock', 'see', 'how', 'world', 'definitely', 'are', 'small', 'people', 'Many', 'things', 'began', 'whipping', 'winter', 'wind', 'how', 'do', 'cope', 'public', 'restrooms', 'Restaurants', 'Bars', 'Mailboxes', 'world', 'not', 'seem', 'hate', 'small', 'people', 'only', 'horribly', 'indifferent', 'needs.Co-starring', 'then-fresh-faced', 'Bobby', 'Cannavale', 'Fin', 'goofy', 'Puerto', 'Rican', 'friend', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'Olivia', 'Fin', 'other', 'friend', 'who', 'terrible', 'demons', 'own', 'writer-director', 'Tom', 'McCarthy', 'not-so-well', 'known', 'very', 'employed', 'actor', 'who', 'done', 'everything', 'bit', 'parts', 'TV', 'larger', 'parts', 'big', 'films', 'other', 'major', 'credit', 'director', 'isThe', 'Visitor', 'one', 'other', 'credit', 'director', 'forget.This', 'belongs', 'collection', 'film', 'lover', 'collection', 'Why', 'R-rating', 'undeserved', 'stupid', 'Often', 'get', 'feeling', 'R', 'only', 'meant', 'show', 'audiences', ""n't"", 'chidlren', 'film', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'well-made', 'children', 'film', 'Miramax', 'got', 'rights', 'release', 'see', 'other', 'releases', 'here', 'expensive', 'release', 'clearly', 'indie', 'film', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'European', 'audiences', 'mind.Watch', 'learn']",The Station Agent
815325,A2Z2URBU123J7N,B0001WTWDI,E. J. Hokanson,"[5, 6]","I saw this great film the other day.  A complex film that works on so many different levels.  Its about loss and redemption.  Its about a dwarf named Fin who undergoes a personal transformation from a angry, bitter, withdrawn, hard, cold man at the beginning into a warm and caring gentleman by the end.  With the help of four well-drawn characters that befriend Fin.  There's Joe (an outgoing chatterbox who operates a coffee stand/truck).  Then there's Olivia (a painter and a mother who had lost her son and separated from her husband).  There's also Cleo (a little black girl who shares an interest in trains).  Also there's Emily (young, naive librarian with an abusive redneck boyfriend).  These characters, in effect, reveal Fin to be something entirely different from what we initially see.  They chip and chisel, and peel back Fin's cold, hard exterior shell to show Fin's real, true character.  The true character that would have been had he not endured such a tough, painful life as a dwarf.

815331,AXFI7TAWD6H6X,B0001WTWDI,Erica Anderson,"[2, 2]","I just came back from seeing ""The Station Agent"". I thought it was a wonderful film. After seeing ""Mystic River"" last month, ""The Station Agent"" is a wonderful antidote to the heavy drama of the Dennis Lehane novel. Peter Dinklage as Finn is worthy of an Oscar nod. It was so refreshing to see a dwarf be portrayed as a human being as opposed to a cartoonish stereotype. Here the viewer sees a man who is only 4 feet, 5 inches tall isolate himself emotionally from society because all his life he had been teased and taunted by people. Finn is forced to interact with his new neighbors in Newfoundland, NJ. Bobby Cannavale as the annoyingly nosy hot dog/coffee vendor Joe and Patricia Clarkson as the grieving Olivia Harris also gave excellent, if not convincing peformances in the film. Joe reminded me how annoying I used to be as a teenager by following other people around. As annoying and nosy Joe was, he had a good heart. He wasn't as obnoxious as tv's Steve Urkel. Patricia Clarkson was wonderful as Olivia Harris. I really enjoyed the scenes when she first encountered Finn in the beginning of the film. Those were hilarious. One of my favorite scenes in the film was when Finn was in the bar getting drunk. I loved how the cinematography was shot from Finn's drunken perspective. Although her presence in the film was albeit brief, former Dawson's Creek star Michelle Williams also performed well. I always did think that she was the talented actor of all the Dawson's Creek cast. Her character's interaction with Finn was sweet. Without giving out anything, I didn't expect for the film to end the way that it did. Not that it is a bad thing, I was just surprised. Some people might be put off by that but I liked being surprised and it pretty much wrapped things up within 90 minutes. ""The Station Agent"" is a character-driven movie. I really enjoy movies like ""The Station Agent"" than the garbage that is currently being churned out at the moment by Hollywood. Human drama makes for a more interesting movie than all the special effects in Hollywood.

Early on in the story we move from Hoboken to the more rural Newfoundland (pronounced NewFOUNDland), when the main character (Fin) inherits the train depot where he plans to live in solitude. Alas, it is not meant to be, as he can't avoid running into others, or rather, as is the case with Olivia, they can't seem to avoid running into him, (almost) literally. There is also Joe, who parks his Dad's mobile hot dog/coffee stand near the depot every day, despite it being a less than ideal place to draw customers, since trains no longer stop here. Nevertheless Fin as ""The Station Agent"", might have known that he would encounter others with varying degrees of baggage. He carries his own baggage too, as he is a man of quiet dignity who is tired of his stature as a dwarf making him an easy target for ridicule. Then there is the young local librarian, with her share of issues as well, in addition to a grammar school student who would like Fin to speak to her class about trains.While at first it appears that these characters have nothing in common, it soon becomes clear that in addition to their own individual demons and travails, they are all genuine and basically good-natured. The movie's conclusion has a sort of ""we may as well chill out and make the best of it"" feel to it, which is sufficiently satisfactory.Not being much of a TV viewer, I'm not familiar with any of these actors, but I think they all do a fine job.

Much of the humor comes from Joe, who forces himself into Fin's life, as well as the attempts by Olivia to try to make up for her first impression on Fin.What's best about this movie is that it gives the actor who plays Fin the ability to show the viewer what it must feel like to be a dwarf, the constant stares and rude comments. But his portrayal isn't meant to invoke sympathy so much as understanding, an understanding that he's come to accept that as his fate, just as much as anyone with any sensitivity should decry it.There's not a conclusion, per se, but there is a resolution, one that affirms the lives of the characters in the story inasmuch as you can see that they learned something from each other. It's like a small version (no pun intended) of The Breakfast Club or The Big Chill, and I'd recommend it.",5,Wonderfully underplayed and life affirming,1162684800,"11 5, 2006",2006,1520,"[""'ve"", 'had', 'movie', 'last', 'month', 'always', 'putting', 'off', 'watching', 'one', 'reason', 'very', 'understated', 'movie', 'much', 'action', 'never', 'commented', 'directly', 'movie', 'left', 'up', 'viewer', 'figure', 'out', 'plot', 'simple', 'Finbar', 'McBride', 'dwarf', 'who', 'job', 'when', 'best', 'friend', 'boss', 'suddenly', 'leaving', 'train', 'depot', 'will', 'Moving', 'small', 'town', 'where', 'depot', 'all', 'do', 'be', 'left', 'alone', 'combination', 'Joe', 'local', 'Cuban', 'hot', 'dog', 'vendor', 'Olivia', 'frazzled', 'young', 'mother', 'who', 'grieving', 'loss', 'son', 'confront', 'new', 'community', 'just', 'are', 'forced', 'confront', 'Much', 'humor', 'Joe', 'who', 'Fin', 'life', 'as', 'well', 'attempts', 'Olivia', 'try', 'make', 'up', 'first', 'impression', 'Fin.What', 'best', 'movie', 'actor', 'who', 'Fin', 'ability', 'show', 'viewer', 'what', 'must', 'feel', 'be', 'dwarf', 'constant', 'stares', 'rude', 'comments', 'portrayal', ""n't"", 'meant', 'invoke', 'sympathy', 'so', 'much', 'understanding', 'understanding', 'come', 'accept', 'fate', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'anyone', 'sensitivity', 'should', 'decry', 'not', 'conclusion', 'se', 'resolution', 'one', 'lives', 'characters', 'story', 'inasmuch', 'can', 'see', 'learned', 'something', 'other', 'small', 'version', 'pun', 'intended', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'Big', 'Chill', ""'d"", 'recommend']",The Station Agent

But this ""small movie"" is very human and manages to sustain your involvement without the usual gratuitous doses of fight or flesh. Finnbar, the main character, is a midget who inherits a disused smalltown train station when his boss dies. He converts this to his new home next to the tracks where trains no longer stop. Initially trying to shun contact with others, his life becomes slowly woven with other characters in this little New Jersey town of Newfoundland. There is Joe, the hot dog/coffee stand vendor, who continually receives calls from his ill father; Olivia, the artist haunted by the accidental death of her young son, which has estranged her from the husband from whom she has now seperated; a pretty young local town librarian who admires the midget's striking facial features; and a young black schoogirl who keeps popping in and out from seemingly nowhere, seeking to get Finnbar to overcome his reluctance to make a presentation on trains to her grade school class. What binds Finnbarr to Joe and Olivia is their common sense of intense loneliness, for which the abandoned silent tracks provide an unmistkable metaphor. Several superbly shot scenes and some wonderful dialogue are what keeps you hooked throughout this movie in addition to some very fine acting. You almost begin feeling after a while that you are next to the same railway tracks or in the same living room as the three main characters.

815350,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0001WTWDI,Grady Harp,"[6, 7]","THE STATION AGENT is a miniature masterpiece.  Director Tom McCarthy has achieved on a small budget, rapid sequence filming, and no frills media use, a film that proves that this art form is alive and well right here in the US.  The story is simple but cogent:  Finbar McBride (Peter Dinklage) is a dwarf who has been working as a model train maker for an African American store owner Henry Styles (Paul Benjamin), one of the few people that treats him without prejudice. Their relationship is gentle but supportive. Henry literally drops dead and Fin discovers he is the sole heir in Henry's will: Fin now owns a dilapidated train depot in Newfoundland, NJ.  Having nowhere else to go, Fin moves into his new home, seeking solitude from the world of ignorantly derisive people.  But parked in front of his space is a Hot Dog and Coffee wagon operated  by garrulous Joe (Bobby Cannavale), a warmly friendly guy who wants to hangout with Fin.  Fin also encounters the slightly flighty artist Olivia (Patricia Clarkson) who after two 'accidental encounters' on the highway seeks out Fin also.  In his attempt to foster anonymity Fin avoids these new would-be friends, spends time at the local library reading about his passion - trains - and encounters the fragile librarian Emily (Michelle Williams) who also finds him strangely attractive.  Another &quot;invader&quot; into his space is a young African American girl Cleo (Raven Goodwin) who simply wants to understand Fin's life and plight.  The story is simply the communication that grows among these disparate people, each needy, each with occult compassion trying to surface.  This interaction is all there is to the 88-minute film, but in its brevity and spare dialogue we are drawn into the lives of these fragile folk to the point that saying goodbye to them at the end is heartrending.  What a cast!  Dinklage, Clarkson, Cannavale, and Williams are as fine as they come, creating as much character with body language and lingering looks than with verbiage.

The Station Agent was such a film, with outstanding performances by Peter Dinklage as Fin, a dwarf who inherits an old abandoned railway station in a rural area of New Jersey; Patricia Clarkson as Olivia, a local woman who's mourning her dead son; and Bobby Cannavale as Joe, who's manning the family's food truck while his father recovers from a heart attack. There's also Michelle Williams in a fine supporting role as Emily, the town librarian.Fin just wants to be left alone, but Olivia keeps running into him (literally!), and Joe just wants some company while he runs the food truck. They make an odd trio, but after a rocky start they develop a friendship for each other, and Fin gradually comes out of his self-imposed withdrawal. It's a quirky little low budget film, but I enjoyed it as much as any of the blockbusters that I've seen in the past year. It's a compelling human interest story with some excellent acting and a great mix of both comedy and drama. And the last scene has some of the best lines I've heard in a movie. Talking about Emily the librarian, it goes like this:Joe: It's the librarian fantasy, man.

815395,A33CLVW2K7SL1P,B0001WTWDI,Jonathan Appleseed,"[3, 5]","I'm really on the fence with this film. I know that it's very highly regarded by the film industry, and that it won a BAFTA award. Obviously, there are people ""in the know"" who think it's terrific. It's one of those ""nothing really happens"" movies, instead being a character piece with human emotion. The problem I have with it is that it doesn't really delve into its characters as much as I feel it should have, and the emotion that's displayed - with one notable exception - is extremely minimal.The story centers around a dwarf (Fin) who inherits half an acre of land, on which is a home and a train depot. Fin is a train enthusiast, and instead of moving into the home, he takes up residence in the train depot. That's a quiet, telling aspect of his personality, and I enjoyed that glimpse into what makes him tick. However, it was what followed that has me on the fence. Beyond that slight ""tell"", and his repeated insistence to be left alone even when some very kind people who accept him for exactly who he is are trying to befriend him, we don't learn very much about his character at all. He definitely grows as a character, and that's absolutely essential for a book or a movie, but the reasons for his growth are unclear: unless it was simply the slow breaking down of his walls by a congenial vendor (Joe) who runs a hot dog/coffee/maybe ice cream stand out of a small trailer right outside of the depot, and a woman (Olivia) who - in two absolutely hysterical moments that left me in stitches - nearly ran him off the road while paying no attention to her driving.Joe, Olivia, and Fin all become good friends - but I really didn't know why. The vendor seemed desperate for friends, and that was easy enough to understand. We met some of his so-called friends, and they were horrendous individuals who made fun of Fin. If I had been in that exact situation, I might have handled it by breaking their noses (although I doubt it). However, it did me that angry and I exclaimed that I *would* have broken their noses. Anyway, that's hardly material.Earlier in the film there were also some very sad and angering moments when kids, as well as adults, made fun of Fin either in whispers or directly out loud so that he could hear. Trying to put myself into the mind of a dwarf who has likely spent most of his life being mocked and made fun, it's a little more understandable as to why he wants to be left alone. However, before his friend died and he inherited the land, he did have a group of friends who were all train enthusiasts. So he wasn't completely cut off from the world.All of these characters are immensely likeable, and the actors put in excellent performances. But like I said, I'm on the fence. I can appreciate movies that tell you more about characters by what is unsaid as opposed to what is said, but I just felt that more should have been said - and I'm not talking monologues here, I just wanted to hear a little more about what Fin felt. There was a perfect opportunity to tell those of us who are ""tall"" exactly what it feels like to be a dwarf, and I felt that the film - while definitely showing us uncomfortable moments in his life - fell short on that. For example - when the group of kids made fun of him, how *exactly* did he feel? All we saw was a blank expression on his face, which did imply that he has learned to simply ignore these taunts, but I wanted more.Still, I did like the film, mostly because, as I said, the characters are very likeable and the performances were top notch.All of my reservations aside, I would still recommend this.",4,I found myself wanting a little more,1107648000,"02 6, 2005",2005,3585,"[""'m"", 'really', 'fence', 'film', 'know', 'very', 'highly', 'regarded', 'film', 'industry', 'won', 'BAFTA', 'award', 'Obviously', 'are', 'people', 'know', 'who', 'think', 'terrific', 'one', 'nothing', 'really', 'movies', 'instead', 'being', 'character', 'piece', 'human', 'emotion', 'problem', 'have', ""n't"", 'really', 'delve', 'characters', 'as', 'much', 'feel', 'should', 'have', 'emotion', 'displayed', 'one', 'notable', 'exception', 'extremely', 'minimal.The', 'story', 'centers', 'dwarf', 'Fin', 'who', 'acre', 'land', 'home', 'train', 'depot', 'Fin', 'train', 'enthusiast', 'instead', 'moving', 'home', 'up', 'residence', 'train', 'depot', 'quiet', 'telling', 'aspect', 'personality', 'enjoyed', 'glimpse', 'what', 'tick', 'However', 'was', 'what', 'followed', 'fence', 'slight', 'tell', 'repeated', 'insistence', 'be', 'left', 'alone', 'even', 'when', 'very', 'kind', 'people', 'who', 'accept', 'exactly', 'who', 'are', 'trying', 'befriend', 'do', ""n't"", 'learn', 'very', 'much', 'character', 'definitely', 'character', 'absolutely', 'essential', 'book', 'movie', 'reasons', 'growth', 'are', 'unclear', 'was', 'simply', 'slow', 'breaking', 'walls', 'congenial', 'vendor', 'Joe', 'who', 'hot', 'dog/coffee/maybe', 'ice', 'cream', 'stand', 'small', 'trailer', 'right', 'outside', 'depot', 'woman', 'Olivia', 'who', 'two', 'absolutely', 'hysterical', 'moments', 'left', 'stitches', 'nearly', 'ran', 'off', 'road', 'paying', 'attention', 'driving.Joe', 'Olivia', 'Fin', 'become', 'good', 'friends', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'vendor', 'seemed', 'desperate', 'friends', 'was', 'easy', 'enough', 'understand', 'met', 'so-called', 'friends', 'were', 'horrendous', 'individuals', 'who', 'made', 'fun', 'Fin', 'had', 'been', 'exact', 'situation', 'might', 'have', 'handled', 'breaking', 'noses', 'doubt', 'However', 'did', 'angry', 'exclaimed', '*would*', 'have', 'broken', 'noses', 'Anyway', 'hardly', 'material.Earlier', 'film', 'were', 'also', 'very', 'sad', 'angering', 'moments', 'when', 'kids', 'as', 'well', 'adults', 'made', 'fun', 'Fin', 'whispers', 'directly', 'out', 'loud', 'so', 'could', 'hear', 'Trying', 'put', 'mind', 'dwarf', 'who', 'likely', 'spent', 'most', 'life', 'being', 'mocked', 'made', 'fun', 'little', 'more', 'understandable', 'why', 'be', 'left', 'alone', 'However', 'friend', 'died', 'inherited', 'land', 'did', 'have', 'group', 'friends', 'who', 'were', 'train', 'enthusiasts', 'was', ""n't"", 'completely', 'cut', 'off', 'world.All', 'characters', 'are', 'immensely', 'likeable', 'actors', 'put', 'excellent', 'performances', 'said', ""'m"", 'fence', 'can', 'appreciate', 'movies', 'tell', 'more', 'characters', 'what', 'unsaid', 'opposed', 'what', 'said', 'just', 'felt', 'more', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'said', ""'m"", 'not', 'talking', 'monologues', 'here', 'just', 'wanted', 'hear', 'little', 'more', 'what', 'Fin', 'felt', 'was', 'perfect', 'opportunity', 'tell', 'who', 'are', 'tall', 'exactly', 'what', 'be', 'dwarf', 'felt', 'film', 'definitely', 'showing', 'uncomfortable', 'moments', 'life', 'fell', 'short', 'example', 'when', 'group', 'kids', 'made', 'fun', 'how', '*exactly*', 'did', 'feel', 'saw', 'was', 'blank', 'expression', 'face', 'did', 'imply', 'learned', 'simply', 'ignore', 'taunts', 'wanted', 'more.Still', 'did', 'film', 'mostly', 'because', 'said', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'likeable', 'performances', 'were', 'top', 'notch.All', 'reservations', 'aside', 'would', 'still', 'recommend']",The Station Agent

815400,A3GRN6J64F2C3X,B0001WTWDI,"Joseph P. Menta, Jr.","[2, 2]","Thomas McCarthy's 2003 drama, ""The Station Agent"", is a film decidedly not for everyone. A dwarf (played by Peter Dinklage, a real-life little person), inherits a train depot out in the boonies from his deceased boss (they had both worked in a small shop that sold and repaired model trains) and promptly moves into the depot to get away from all the stares and other nonsense people like him have to deal with on a daily basis.The rest of the movie is basically Fin (Fin McBride is the character's name) dealing with the fact that no one leaves him alone once he moves into the remote depot in the wilds of New Jersey... not the guy who runs the coffee truck (played by Bobby Cannivale), who inexplicably sets up every morning in the deserted area near Fin's new residence, or the somewhat distracted artist covered with paint spatters (Patricia Clarkson) who seemingly is the coffee truck's only customer. They're both fascinated with Fin, first because of his dwarfism but later because he demonstrates (despite his efforts to be left alone) that he's an interesting guy, and kind of nice to be around. Soon, they (and a couple of others) don't even notice he's a dwarf and just want to get a little of his attention. You see, they're all misfits, too, if not in an immediately recognizable way like Fin.Like I said, it's not a complicated, densely plotted movie, and many will likely cop a ""what's the point?"" attitude. But, if you can enjoy watching everybody becoming a little richer and perhaps happier from their new associations with each other (even Fin), this might be worth your time. In my view, ""The Station Agent"" is offbeat, funny, not too serious (though there are some serious moments), and overall a warm, resonant hour and a half or so.

The three main characters are all somewhat displaced, with Fin, the ""little person,"" inheriting a train station in the middle of nowhere; Olivia staying at a ""get-away"" home purchased by her husband before he ""got away"" and still grieving the sudden death of her young son; and Joe, the chatty hot-dog vendor who loves to talk and cook, who has returned to care for his ailing father and run his vending truck. These three characters apparently have little in common but a need to care and be cared for. Fin wants isolation, but the quirky characters in his midst won't allow that. He feels like a freak because of his size, but that goes away when he is spending time with his new friends.

815417,A27CHILBK6HIL2,B0001WTWDI,Kaya Savas,"[5, 5]","MOVIE: This film is probably the best film I've ever seen. With movies these days it is so difficult to find a true film. A film not a movie. The Station Agent tells the story of a dwarf named Finn. He worked at a train model store and was close friends with the owner. When the owner dies he leaves Finn his old station house, and with no home or family this is where Finn lives. All his life Finn has to deal with the bitter remarks people make at him and the beating of society has left Finn isolated and alone. All he wants is to be left alone. While at his new found house in Newfoundland, New Jersey, catchy symbolism isn't it, he meets a hot dog stand guy named Joe and a middle aged woman named Olivia. They slowly become friends and share the fact that each of them are struggling with their lives in some aspect. Each of them discover that being with each other is a lot more rewarding than being isolated from the brutality of life. The movie is also filled with rich symbolism and each shot is framed with so much meaning. The town as mentioned before is called Newfoundland, New Jersey. Finn being a train enthusiast works out for the symbolism especially the scenes of him walking the train tracks. Trains have a structured path, only one way to go. Finn has limited himself to this ""one path"" way of life and with his new found friendships he starts to create his own path instead of letting society move him. This film is not only a comic gem but it is emotionally powerful. First time writer and director Tom McCarthy has proven himself to be a great filmmaker with his first film, a rarity now days. This small film has such a powerful effect on the audience that you will be thinking about it long after you see it. After I watched it on DVD I said the same thing to myself that I said after seeing it in the theater, ""man, what a great film"". People who limit themselves to movies like The Matrix, Lord of the Rings, and Star Wars have my pity because they will never know what they are missing. I guarantee that this movie will move you emotionally and will be an experience you will never forget.VIDEO: The DVD has a very decent picture, and in order to get the full effect of the vibrant shots and the train track scenes it is best to watch on a HD Widescreen tv. Even though the acting is what made the film, the cinematography was also exceptional.AUDIO: Basic 5.1 Audio mix that does the job. This is a character-based movie and really doesn't require a heavy based sound mix.PACKAGING / EXTRAS: The DVD comes in the standard Armaray case with no insert.  The only extras are deleted scenes and a commentary by McCarthy. Miramax has also thrown in a bunch of trailers for their other movies like Cold Mountain, City of God, The Barbarian Invasions, and some others.  Being a small movie that probably many average movie goers never heard of, it was expected to have a bare-bones release on DVD. I really feel bad that movies like this never get to see a wide release or a large amount of interest because these are the movies that film was invented for.MOVIE SCORE: (* * * * *). . . and then someDVD SCORE: (7 / 10)",5,Not Only Genuine & True But Emotionally Moving,1087689600,"06 20, 2004",2004,3141,"['MOVIE', 'film', 'probably', 'best', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'movies', 'days', 'so', 'difficult', 'find', 'true', 'film', 'film', 'not', 'movie', 'Station', 'Agent', 'story', 'dwarf', 'named', 'Finn', 'worked', 'train', 'model', 'store', 'was', 'close', 'friends', 'owner', 'When', 'owner', 'Finn', 'old', 'station', 'house', 'home', 'family', 'where', 'Finn', 'life', 'Finn', 'deal', 'bitter', 'remarks', 'people', 'make', 'beating', 'society', 'left', 'Finn', 'isolated', 'alone', 'be', 'left', 'alone', 'new', 'found', 'house', 'Newfoundland', 'New', 'Jersey', 'catchy', 'symbolism', ""n't"", 'hot', 'dog', 'stand', 'guy', 'named', 'Joe', 'middle', 'aged', 'woman', 'named', 'Olivia', 'slowly', 'become', 'friends', 'share', 'fact', 'are', 'struggling', 'lives', 'aspect', 'discover', 'being', 'other', 'lot', 'more', 'rewarding', 'being', 'isolated', 'brutality', 'life', 'movie', 'also', 'filled', 'rich', 'symbolism', 'shot', 'framed', 'so', 'much', 'meaning', 'town', 'as', 'mentioned', 'called', 'Newfoundland', 'New', 'Jersey', 'Finn', 'being', 'train', 'enthusiast', 'out', 'symbolism', 'especially', 'scenes', 'walking', 'train', 'tracks', 'Trains', 'have', 'structured', 'path', 'only', 'one', 'way', 'go', 'Finn', 'limited', 'one', 'path', 'way', 'life', 'new', 'found', 'friendships', 'create', 'own', 'path', 'instead', 'letting', 'society', 'move', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'comic', 'gem', 'emotionally', 'powerful', 'First', 'time', 'writer', 'director', 'Tom', 'McCarthy', 'proven', 'be', 'great', 'filmmaker', 'first', 'film', 'rarity', 'now', 'days', 'small', 'film', 'powerful', 'effect', 'audience', 'will', 'be', 'thinking', 'long', 'see', 'watched', 'DVD', 'said', 'same', 'thing', 'myself', 'said', 'seeing', 'theater', 'man', 'what', 'great', 'film', 'People', 'who', 'limit', 'movies', 'Matrix', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Star', 'Wars', 'have', 'pity', 'will', 'never', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'missing', 'guarantee', 'movie', 'will', 'move', 'emotionally', 'will', 'be', 'experience', 'will', 'never', 'forget.VIDEO', 'DVD', 'very', 'decent', 'picture', 'order', 'get', 'full', 'effect', 'vibrant', 'shots', 'train', 'track', 'scenes', 'best', 'watch', 'HD', 'Widescreen', 'tv', 'Even', 'acting', 'what', 'made', 'film', 'cinematography', 'was', 'also', 'exceptional.AUDIO', 'Basic', '5.1', 'Audio', 'mix', 'job', 'character-based', 'movie', 'really', ""n't"", 'require', 'heavy', 'based', 'sound', 'mix.PACKAGING', '/', 'EXTRAS', 'DVD', 'standard', 'Armaray', 'case', 'insert', 'only', 'extras', 'are', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'commentary', 'McCarthy', 'Miramax', 'also', 'thrown', 'bunch', 'trailers', 'other', 'movies', 'Cold', 'Mountain', 'City', 'God', 'Barbarian', 'Invasions', 'others', 'Being', 'small', 'movie', 'probably', 'many', 'average', 'movie', 'goers', 'never', 'heard', 'was', 'expected', 'have', 'bare-bones', 'release', 'DVD', 'really', 'feel', 'bad', 'movies', 'never', 'get', 'see', 'wide', 'release', 'large', 'amount', 'interest', 'are', 'movies', 'film', 'was', 'invented', 'for.MOVIE', 'SCORE', '*', '*', '*', '*', '*', 'then', 'someDVD', 'SCORE', '7', '/', '10']",The Station Agent

The story revolves around Fin (Peter Dinklage) who is constantly reminded in malicious ways of his short stature as he suffers from dwarfism.  When Fin's only friend and owner of the store in which he works dies he inherits a small rail road station, which is no longer in use.  The station is located in small town where time seems to stand still.  Fin seizes the opportunity and moves to the remote location as he seeks solitude from the constant staring and hounding.  However, as Fin arrives he is constantly followed by the talkative and good-willed Joe, the scatter-brained mourning Olivia, and the shy elementary school girl Cleo among others.  In the company of these people Fin shares his joy and interests as it opens up the pleasure of living for Fin.  The story offers much wonder for hope and promise as it deals with a delicate issue, which is portrayed with much class and style.  The simple mise-en-scene is merely brilliant as it only depicts what is needed to know, yet it enhances each scene as it offers more to think about.

These characters form an unlikely trio, but it maintains believability -- if for no other reason than the sheer improbability of it all (i.e. truth is stranger than fiction).The movie has it's sorrowful moments. It is difficult not to pity Fin for his self-imposed isolation at times. And the divorcee's anguish over her son's death strikes an emotional chord.

It deals with a difficult topic - dwarfs and the ridicule they go through. Finnbar McBride (Peter Dinklage) is the central character and is extremely powerful but quite - he is a dwarf and gets ridiculed left and right but still does not loose his composure (except for once) when he goes to the local bar and gets drunk. But then every human being has his or her weaknesses. Finn loves train and details of train - his dream comes true when he goes for train chasing with his friend Joe (the hot dog vendor). Life is difficult for him but he accepts it in its ways and in his way - rather than fighting it head on, he used diplomacy and works around the difficulties. Thomas McCarthy has done an wonderful job of mixing the characters with the environment even though they all stand out odd. Olivia the local artist who is also suffering from a lose of a son becomes friends with Finn and Joe and in the process befriends her already estranged husband. Just one point - I think the photography - especially the canvas selection and the light effects could have been little better.

Three quirky characters in an improbably deserted New Jersey town could become quickly tedious. The Station Agent, however, turned out to be a pleasant surprise; its characters are real, complex and original people and the interaction between them interesting, realistic and not at all sentimentalized.Peter Dinklage has the starring role as Finbar, a dwarf who inherits an old railroad station house that he moves into. He  soon meets Joe (Bobby Cannavale), a gregarious food vendor and Olivia (Patricia Clarkson), a troubled artist. Both of these people impose themselves on the reclusive Finbar; Joe's meal truck is parked right across from his new home, and Olivia almost runs him over. Finbar is a truly well developed character. Marginalized from society, he takes refuge in his passion for trains. His plight of being treated as an oddity is made clear without making him an object of pity. Only with great reluctance does he gradually open up to his new friends. Joe and Olivia, however, have their own troubles and the relationship among the three is not always smooth.The Station Agent explores what can happen when people who have little in common are brought together by circumstances. Finbar, Olivia and Joe interact  mainly because they find themselves in physical proximity to each other; as events in their lives unfold, their tenuous bond is almost broken. One problem that low budget films often have is a feeling of claustrophobia, as there are only a handful of characters. The Station Agent almost falls into this category (with these three people running into each other everywhere they go), but fortunately there are a few good supporting characters to fill out the landscape; a librarian who finds Finbar attractive, Olivia's ex-husband and a young girl who shares Finbar's fascination with trains.The Station Agent, written and directed by Thomas McCarthy, is slow-paced and character-driven.

I will  recommend the film highly and try to justify the recommendation without spoilers.  If you are really worried about it, just go watch the movie and stop reading now. . . it's the best advice I can give.Thematically the film deals with isolation from the lives of the people around you for three main characters with divergent reasons for finding themselves removed from the company of others.Don't expect a thrill a minute, fast paced film, but rather a thoughtful story played out with just as much non-verbal emotional content as well-crafted dialogue.  Peter Dinklage is excellent in a role that, ironically, depends entirely on his physical presence as a little person, but offers him a chance to connect with the viewer as so much more than that.  His talent as an actor is quite apparent from the film (and he was recognized with several award wins and nominations) and I felt that the character of Finn gave some real insight into what it is like for someone four-feet five-inches tall on a daily basis without exploiting that premise in any way (as is often the case in the media).Patricia Clarkson also offers a superb performance and she is a personal favorite of mine.  Her appearance in several episodes of Frasier and Six Feet Under and her role in the Green Mile are excellent, but in this movie she really gets the screen time that she deserves, and the result is a film with great spirit, some funny moments and a realistic quality that seems unspoiled by larger studio productions' need to end in utter triumph or dismal trajedy.

Only problem is he is made fun of and except for his boss, has no friends. A short ways into the movie, his boss dies and leaves him an abandoned train depot in Newfoundland, New Jersey. He packs up his meager belongings and sets out for this remote country place where he can at least be left alone.When he arrives at the station he finds that it is right next to the still-active railroad tracks. It is run down and it only has a couch to sleep on, no phone, nor any other utilities. He seems satisfied that he can live his life of train watching in solitude. But the first morning, he is awakened by Joe (Bobby Cannavale), a sociable young man whose hot-dog truck is parked right next to the depot. Joe is very persistent in wanting to be Fin's friend and he never seems to stop talking. Another would be friend is Olivia (Patricia Clarkson), who he meets because she nearly runs over him twice in the same day with her car.Fin does all he can to avoid these new acquaintances by taking long walks on the railroad right-of-way and checking the timing of the trains at a bridge. But they manage to wear him down. They learn a little bit more about each other every time and learn to respect each other's privacy as well.This film shows us how important friendship is and how it grows. That you should not judge people by how they look, but what they do. And that no one really wants to be a loner. It is an incredible film.

815453,A2B6VI9MQI0WKI,B0001WTWDI,Matthew Gladney,"[8, 9]","It becomes apparent early on that ""The Station Agent"" is not your usual film. It sets a slow, methodical pace which will not satisfy the typical multi-plex audiences. It presents characters without offering a lot of explanation for them. You are required to pay attention to how they act in order to find out who they are. There are no long, informative, tell-all speeches by these people, the kind that you would find in a more mainstream movie. And, somewhat surprisingly, there is no real resolution to the three main lives that the film touches upon. And yet, somehow it all works.Peter Dinklage plays the lead role in ""The Station Agent"". He is Finbar McBride, a solitary man who works with an older black gentleman named Henry in a Main Street-style shop which sells & repairs model trains. Henry and Fin are train enthusiasts, and even watch home movies other people have made that are nothing more than different camera angles of trains. When Henry dies suddenly, Fin discovers that his friend has bequeathed him a half-acre of land in Newfoundland, New Jersey. On the land is an old train depot, where the station agent used to reside. Here is where Fin decides he will go and live, and it is where the main point of the movie begins.Across the tracks from the train depot is Joe, an obviously lonely young man who runs a portable coffee and hot dog stand. He quickly rushes to befriend Fin, but finds it at first to be of some difficulty. Fin, you see, is a dwarf, and has put up a protective barrier to shield himself from what can often be an unkind and unthinking humanity. When Joe invites Fin to the local tavern, the dwarf refuses. We later find out why. Though Fin tries to separate himself from people, he is only human, and therefore becomes resentful of his home-made prison of loneliness. This leads to him eventually accepting Joe's goofy version of friendship. The third lonely person added to the mix is Olivia, a forty-something woman who has recently lost her child through death, and her husband through mutual separation. Olivia is not only lonely, but also fragile and unstable. Together these three lost souls attempt to bolster each other through simple companionship. Sometimes it works, while other times it doesn't. Add into the mix two more lonely people: a young librarian woman who takes a physical interest in Fin, and a little girl named Cleo who likes to hang out with Fin and old abandoned trains more than with kids her own age, and you have a movie full of disheartened, dejected characters.But ""The Station Agent"" is certainly a unique film. It moves at its own pace, and tells its story through what the characters say, rather than what they explain. Have you ever noticed that, in most movies, if a character has some deep, dark pain in their life, there will inevitably come a scene (or perhaps multiple scenes) where the character will unload and explain everything that's going on with them? They will provide life history, present angst, and maybe even future worries. Not so with ""The Station Agent"". You'd just better pay attention to what these people say, as unimportant as it sometimes may sound, and as infrequently as it may come, if you want to grasp what's really going on with them and what their roles are within the film. This is not a movie for relaxing and letting your mind glaze over. This is a movie which treats the viewer with respect. It assumes you are intelligent and alert. And I appreciate that. My only real complaint with the film is that there are still some unanswered questions that the writer/director could have taken some time in answering, although I suppose they are not super-vital to the story.The acting job by the three leads - Peter Dinklage as Fin, Bobby Cannavale as Joe, and Patricia Clarkson as Olivia, is realistic and superb. These definitely feel like characters, not actors. If the locations used for Newfoundland, New Jersey are not real, then they sure did a good job making them seem as if they were. There is such a flavor of truth to the whole film that it can only help propel it to a higher level of entertainment. And a special mention should be made for Stephen Trask, incidental music composer. His work here fits in perfectly with the mood of the movie.""The Station Agent"" is not your typical movie-going experience, but that is a good thing. It is a slowly unfolding film about lonely people who find each other and do what they can to help themselves through the kind of companionship that only humanity can provide, in its unique, quirky way. It doesn't explain, it simply 'is'. The characters seem like real people, and we find that they are easy to relate to. Already you have the pieces in place for a great movie. And ""The Station Agent"" does not fail in that regard.",4,Letting It Unfold,1070841600,"12 8, 2003",2003,4782,"['apparent', 'early', 'Station', 'Agent', 'not', 'usual', 'film', 'slow', 'methodical', 'pace', 'will', 'not', 'satisfy', 'typical', 'multi-plex', 'audiences', 'characters', 'offering', 'lot', 'explanation', 'are', 'required', 'pay', 'attention', 'how', 'act', 'order', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'are', 'are', 'long', 'informative', 'tell-all', 'speeches', 'people', 'kind', 'would', 'find', 'more', 'mainstream', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'surprisingly', 'real', 'resolution', 'three', 'main', 'lives', 'film', 'touches', 'yet', 'somehow', 'works.Peter', 'Dinklage', 'lead', 'role', 'Station', 'Agent', 'Finbar', 'McBride', 'solitary', 'man', 'who', 'older', 'black', 'gentleman', 'named', 'Henry', 'Main', 'Street-style', 'shop', 'repairs', 'model', 'trains', 'Henry', 'Fin', 'are', 'train', 'enthusiasts', 'even', 'watch', 'home', 'movies', 'other', 'people', 'have', 'made', 'are', 'nothing', 'more', 'different', 'camera', 'angles', 'trains', 'When', 'Henry', 'suddenly', 'Fin', 'friend', 'bequeathed', 'half-acre', 'land', 'Newfoundland', 'New', 'Jersey', 'land', 'old', 'train', 'depot', 'where', 'station', 'agent', 'used', 'reside', 'Here', 'where', 'Fin', 'will', 'go', 'live', 'where', 'main', 'point', 'movie', 'tracks', 'train', 'depot', 'Joe', 'obviously', 'lonely', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'portable', 'coffee', 'hot', 'dog', 'stand', 'quickly', 'befriend', 'Fin', 'first', 'be', 'difficulty', 'Fin', 'see', 'dwarf', 'put', 'up', 'protective', 'barrier', 'shield', 'what', 'can', 'often', 'be', 'unkind', 'unthinking', 'humanity', 'When', 'Joe', 'Fin', 'local', 'tavern', 'dwarf', 'later', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'Fin', 'tries', 'separate', 'people', 'only', 'human', 'therefore', 'becomes', 'resentful', 'home-made', 'prison', 'loneliness', 'eventually', 'accepting', 'Joe', 'goofy', 'version', 'friendship', 'third', 'lonely', 'person', 'added', 'mix', 'Olivia', 'forty-something', 'woman', 'who', 'recently', 'lost', 'child', 'death', 'husband', 'mutual', 'separation', 'Olivia', 'not', 'only', 'lonely', 'also', 'fragile', 'unstable', 'Together', 'three', 'lost', 'souls', 'attempt', 'bolster', 'other', 'simple', 'companionship', 'other', 'times', ""n't"", 'Add', 'mix', 'two', 'more', 'lonely', 'people', 'young', 'librarian', 'woman', 'who', 'physical', 'interest', 'Fin', 'little', 'girl', 'named', 'Cleo', 'who', 'hang', 'out', 'Fin', 'old', 'abandoned', 'trains', 'more', 'kids', 'own', 'age', 'have', 'movie', 'full', 'disheartened', 'dejected', 'characters.But', 'Station', 'Agent', 'certainly', 'unique', 'film', 'own', 'pace', 'story', 'what', 'characters', 'say', 'rather', 'what', 'explain', 'Have', 'ever', 'noticed', 'most', 'movies', 'character', 'deep', 'dark', 'pain', 'life', 'will', 'inevitably', 'come', 'scene', 'perhaps', 'multiple', 'scenes', 'where', 'character', 'will', 'unload', 'explain', 'everything', 'going', 'will', 'provide', 'life', 'history', 'present', 'angst', 'maybe', 'even', 'future', 'worries', 'Not', 'so', 'Station', 'Agent', ""'d"", 'just', 'better', 'pay', 'attention', 'what', 'people', 'say', 'as', 'unimportant', 'may', 'sound', 'as', 'infrequently', 'may', 'come', 'want', 'grasp', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'what', 'roles', 'are', 'film', 'not', 'movie', 'relaxing', 'letting', 'mind', 'glaze', 'movie', 'viewer', 'respect', 'are', 'intelligent', 'alert', 'appreciate', 'only', 'real', 'complaint', 'film', 'are', 'still', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'writer/director', 'could', 'have', 'taken', 'time', 'answering', 'suppose', 'are', 'not', 'super-vital', 'story.The', 'acting', 'job', 'three', 'Peter', 'Dinklage', 'Fin', 'Bobby', 'Cannavale', 'Joe', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'Olivia', 'realistic', 'superb', 'definitely', 'feel', 'characters', 'not', 'actors', 'locations', 'used', 'Newfoundland', 'New', 'Jersey', 'are', 'not', 'real', 'then', 'sure', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'making', 'seem', 'were', 'such', 'flavor', 'truth', 'whole', 'film', 'can', 'only', 'help', 'propel', 'higher', 'level', 'entertainment', 'special', 'mention', 'should', 'be', 'made', 'Stephen', 'Trask', 'incidental', 'music', 'composer', 'work', 'here', 'perfectly', 'mood', 'movie', 'Station', 'Agent', 'not', 'typical', 'movie-going', 'experience', 'good', 'thing', 'slowly', 'unfolding', 'film', 'lonely', 'people', 'who', 'find', 'other', 'do', 'what', 'can', 'help', 'kind', 'companionship', 'only', 'humanity', 'can', 'provide', 'unique', 'quirky', 'way', ""n't"", 'explain', 'simply', ""'is"", 'characters', 'seem', 'real', 'people', 'find', 'are', 'easy', 'relate', 'Already', 'have', 'pieces', 'place', 'great', 'movie', 'Station', 'Agent', 'not', 'fail', 'regard']",The Station Agent

His major passion and love is Trains: loves the romance of them, their ability to take you away from it all, the bigness and solidity of them. Because of his size, Fin has had a troubled life and he avoids people like the plague so as not to be wounded. He has one friend, a fellow Train Shop worker who dies one day and leaves Fin a Train Station House and an acre of surrounding land. And Fin goes there to live out his life as far away from those who have hurt him his entire life. But he didn't count on Joe (handsome, robust, smack-talking but lovable Bobby Carnavale), a snack truck vendor or Olivia (lithe, sensitive, barely able to keep it together Patricia Clarkson), a neighbor who is trying to get over the loss of her son and a divorce.The dynamics of these three is interestingly askew in that Fin, wary and committed to the notion that he will always be alone and without friends, is actively pursued by Joe for that very thing: friendship. And Olivia, having literally run Fin off a road twice, seeks Fin's forgiveness at first, then ultimately his friendship.

That ""The Station Agent"" did so is an unexpected and delightful surprise. This gentle, poignant film--which unfolds like a perfectly wrought short story--tells the tale of Fin (Peter Dinklage), a four-foot five-inch, thirtysomething guy who works in a model train store and has a lifelong fascination with trains. Used to the mockery of those around him, he lives devoid of human contact other than his sympathetic boss and a few fellow train enthusiasts. When his boss dies, he leaves Fin a decrepit train depot in a rural part of New Jersey; Fin, having no other place that will take him in, goes to the depot to live. There, almost against his will, he begins to establish contact with a few of the local residents, including two who in their own ways are as lonely as Fin: Joe (Bobby Cannavale), a convivial, motormouth hot dog vendor saddled with a chronically ill father, and Olivia (Patricia Clarkson), an eccentric artist grieving over the loss of her small son and her bitter estrangement from her husband. How Fin, Joe and Olivia slowly, clumsily discover their common bonds forms the main story of ""The Station Agent."" It's scarcely an earth-shattering story, and the low budget is always evident; yet ""The Station Agent"" never puts a foot wrong. The story and dialogue continually offer small, revealing surprises about the characters, and the performances of Dinklage, Clarkson and Cannavale are exquisitely natural and unaffected.

Fin McBride (Peter Dinklage) is an ordinary man who can't seem to escape the constant attention of strangers because he is a dwarf. When he inherits an abandoned train station, complete with station agent's building, in this remote New Jersey town, he jumps at the chance to become a recluse. Upon moving into the station, he discovers that it is not as out of the way as he might have hoped. A very friendly coffee and hot dog vendor named Joe (Bobby Cannavale) sets up shop practically on his doorstep every day. Though he might try, Fin can't avoid Joe or Olivia Harris (Patricia Clarkson), an accident-prone artist who lives nearby.&quot;The Station Agent&quot; is about three people who at first glance might appear to have nothing in common beyond a coffee stand. But these people are interesting, and it's interesting to watch them develop a friendship, sometimes in spite of themselves. Thomas McCarthy has written a fine character piece and directed an attractive film, but these characters could have easily been two-dimensional without superb performances from the actors. Peter Dinklage, Patricia Clarkson, and Bobby Cannavale have made the recluse, the grieving woman, and the motor-mouth interesting individuals who are full of life. They're people whom we might not mind running into if we were passing through their neck of the woods, which is a great achievement for a writer or casting director. &quot;The Station Agent &quot; presents the vitality in life's hardships and the value of unlikely friendships without being overbearing.The DVD: Bonus features include deleted scenes and an audio commentary by writer/director Thomas McCarthy and actors Peter Dinklage, Patricia Clarkson, and Bobby Cannavale.

More than anything it teaches viewers that ""families"" come in all sorts and types.Finn, a dwarf played by Peter Dinklage, works for a store, which specializes in toy trains and their repair.  He is also a member of a train club, which chases trains and videotapes their train rides, or chases.  Sullen and withdrawn Finn inherits a piece of land in New Jersey with a depot on the grounds when his boss dies. Retreating to the depot, he finds a brash, loud and outgoing young man, Joe played by Booby Cannevale who is working at his father roadside coffee stand. Joe tried to reach out to Finn and slowly immerses himself in Finn's life, walking the train tracks with him and filming a train as they ride along in his car. Patricia Clarkson as Olivia, an artist who is separated from her husband and grieving for her young son who was killed, plays the third member of this unlikely trio. The three of them slowly become friends and one can't help but get the feeling that these are real people rather than actors playing roles. How they reach out to one another and form their ties is the basis for this movie and one well worth seeing.  While Patricia Clarkson and Bobby Cannevale are well suited for their roles, the movie ultimately belongs to Finn as he comes to terms with his size and desires.I laughed, I cried and I thoroughly enjoyed this film.

When the store's owner dies, Finn discovers that the man (quite possibly his only friend) willed him a small train depot. Finn moves to the depot, most likely planning to live the life of a hermit and grieve the death of his friend. However, two new friends - the lonely Olivia (struggling with the death of her son and the dissolution of her marriage) and goofy Joe (who runs a hotdog stand near the depot and seems desperate for companionship) - seem to have other plans. It doesn't sound like much to hang a movie on, but I thought this was a great character-driven film. The performances turned in by all of the primary actors - Peter Dinklage as Finn, Patricia Clarkson as Olivia, and Bobby Cannavale as Joe - were exceptional. At first, I had a hard time warming up to Finn. However, the viewer quickly realizes that Finn has developed a tough hide in order to better endure the cruelties of being a dwarf. By the end of the movie, Dinklage allowed the character to soften a bit, and he ended up winning me over. Cannavale had some masterful scenes. He does such a good job of playing the well-meaning but somewhat annoying sidekick that it is difficult not to fall in love with him immediately. Clarkson, who seems at first a ditzy artist, quickly turns such pigeonholing on its ear, displaying remarkable depth when discussing her dead son and her failing marriage.All in all, I thought this was a great movie about what it is to be someone who both craves isolation and companionship.",5,A great indie film,1125964800,"09 6, 2005",2005,1622,"['Station', 'Agent', 'director', 'screenwriter', 'Thomas', 'McCarthy', 'Finn', 'dwarf', 'who', 'model', 'train', 'store', 'When', 'store', 'owner', 'dies', 'Finn', 'man', 'quite', 'possibly', 'only', 'friend', 'willed', 'small', 'train', 'depot', 'Finn', 'depot', 'most', 'likely', 'planning', 'live', 'life', 'hermit', 'grieve', 'death', 'friend', 'However', 'two', 'new', 'friends', 'lonely', 'Olivia', 'struggling', 'death', 'son', 'dissolution', 'marriage', 'goofy', 'Joe', 'who', 'hotdog', 'stand', 'depot', 'desperate', 'companionship', 'seem', 'have', 'other', 'plans', ""n't"", 'sound', 'much', 'hang', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'character-driven', 'film', 'performances', 'turned', 'primary', 'actors', 'Peter', 'Dinklage', 'Finn', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'Olivia', 'Bobby', 'Cannavale', 'Joe', 'were', 'exceptional', 'first', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'warming', 'up', 'Finn', 'However', 'viewer', 'quickly', 'Finn', 'developed', 'tough', 'hide', 'order', 'better', 'endure', 'cruelties', 'being', 'dwarf', 'end', 'movie', 'Dinklage', 'allowed', 'character', 'soften', 'bit', 'ended', 'up', 'winning', 'Cannavale', 'had', 'masterful', 'scenes', 'good', 'job', 'playing', 'well-meaning', 'somewhat', 'annoying', 'sidekick', 'difficult', 'not', 'fall', 'love', 'immediately', 'Clarkson', 'who', 'first', 'ditzy', 'artist', 'quickly', 'such', 'pigeonholing', 'ear', 'displaying', 'remarkable', 'depth', 'when', 'discussing', 'dead', 'son', 'failing', 'marriage.All', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'what', 'be', 'someone', 'who', 'craves', 'isolation', 'companionship']",The Station Agent

In my opinion, he's like the 3M Company, in that he might not create the scene, but he sure does make the scene better.Virtually everything in the movie that he does, I get.  And I get the whole 'I want to be left alone' thing that he does throughout the movie.  What I don't get, is why the people around him can't respect that.  All that seems to go on with the two other main characters is that they want to ingratiate themselves on him, and for what purpose I'd like to know?And the thing with the hotdog vendor, you mean to tell me that he's from Manhattan, where there's probably a million people wandering the streets, and he's going to set up shop at a nowhere spot in the middle of nowhere?  How's he supposed to make money? Come on!And that's another problem with the screenplay.  I mean, is the Peter Dinklage character supposed to be independently weatlthy or something?  How does he get his money for stuff--like the coffee and ALL those cigarettes?And how does the Bobby Cannavale character suppose to live in Manhattan (of all places) if he can't even sell enough coffee to fill his gas tank?This movie, I don't know?  It left a lot of questions for me.  I couldn't even get into the Patricia Clarkson character very much.  I mean, I know she's hurting because she lost her son.  But, I think it was the way the movie presented this plight.  I mean, it's kinda hard to feel anything, when we (the audience) didn't have the chance to know her son too.  (I mean, it's just the way things should be presented in a movie--so you get to feel for and grow with the characters.)  I can't see where this was done right with this movie.All in all, I hate it when filmmakers go about making these 'quirky' little movies that don't really say very much and don't do very much.  I mean, remember when a 'quirky' movie was something like that gem of a movie:  Harold & Maude.  Or maybe even the original version of Sweet November?  Now that's the kind of quirk that I can get into--quirk with a point.  Quirk with great story telling.  I don't know what the Station Agent was trying to tell?Either way, if you want to see Peter Dinklage in something good, then PLEASE check out his performance in Season 4 of Nip/Tuck.

815484,ARMVAHWQQ9S8A,B0001WTWDI,"Pat Shand ""Pat Shand""","[1, 1]","I'm picky and usually unwilling to try new things.  So when I had to watch this movie for a film class, I--with a deep sigh--went out to Blockbuster and rented the movie, put it in my DVD player--adding one more sigh, in case the point hasn't been made--and began to watch the movie, ready to take notes on all the technical aspects and whatnot.  I was so engrossed in the film by the time ten minutes had passed that I was ready to abandon my assignment (the note taking) and simply enjoy the movie.It would be easy to say that the every day struggles of a dwarf, or any `little person' for that matter, makes up the drama in ""The Station Agent.""  There certainly would be enough evidence to back it up: Kids make fun of Finn (the main character, who happens to be a dwarf), adults--sometimes--do not notice him, and when they do, they often embarrass him; they take pictures of him and even heckle him the same way that children do.  However, when one looks deeper into the movie, they can see that the movie makes a statement on communication:  No one knows how to properly communicate with Finn--or other people like him--properly, which has convinced him to become a withdrawn person.I'm certainly not going to give anything away, but I'll tell you this.  Two characters are introduced into Finn's life that cause... maybe FORCE is a better term...him to open up, to show them who he truly is.  It makes for a funny, touching, and inspiring drama.  The writing and the direction is top notch, each line and each shot conscious of the theme of the film and furthering what can only be described as an intense character study of Finn and the people who surround him.For anyone wanting an enjoyable movie with a very tight story, centered not on action or melodrama, but a subtle look into the life of a man named Finn McBride, I recommend this film.  I not only enjoyed it, but I also took something out of it:  I'm going to be more open-minded with my choices in the future, because I wound up being very glad that I had experienced this movie.9/10",5,Started As An Assignment...,1190246400,"09 20, 2007",2007,2052,"[""'m"", 'picky', 'usually', 'unwilling', 'try', 'new', 'things', 'So', 'when', 'had', 'watch', 'movie', 'film', 'class', 'deep', 'sigh', 'went', 'Blockbuster', 'rented', 'movie', 'put', 'DVD', 'player', 'adding', 'one', 'more', 'sigh', 'case', 'point', ""n't"", 'been', 'made', 'began', 'watch', 'movie', 'ready', 'take', 'notes', 'technical', 'aspects', 'whatnot', 'was', 'so', 'engrossed', 'film', 'time', 'ten', 'minutes', 'had', 'passed', 'was', 'ready', 'abandon', 'assignment', 'note', 'taking', 'simply', 'enjoy', 'movie.It', 'would', 'be', 'easy', 'say', 'day', 'dwarf', 'little', 'person', 'matter', 'up', 'drama', 'Station', 'Agent', 'certainly', 'would', 'be', 'enough', 'evidence', 'back', 'up', 'Kids', 'make', 'fun', 'Finn', 'main', 'character', 'who', 'be', 'dwarf', 'adults', 'sometimes', 'do', 'not', 'notice', 'when', 'do', 'often', 'embarrass', 'take', 'pictures', 'even', 'heckle', 'same', 'way', 'children', 'do', 'However', 'when', 'one', 'deeper', 'movie', 'can', 'see', 'movie', 'statement', 'communication', 'one', 'how', 'properly', 'communicate', 'Finn', 'other', 'people', 'properly', 'convinced', 'become', 'withdrawn', 'person.I', ""'m"", 'certainly', 'not', 'going', 'give', 'anything', 'away', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'Two', 'characters', 'are', 'introduced', 'Finn', 'life', 'cause', 'maybe', 'FORCE', 'better', 'term', 'open', 'up', 'show', 'who', 'truly', 'funny', 'touching', 'inspiring', 'drama', 'writing', 'direction', 'top', 'notch', 'line', 'shot', 'conscious', 'theme', 'film', 'furthering', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'described', 'intense', 'character', 'study', 'Finn', 'people', 'who', 'surround', 'him.For', 'anyone', 'wanting', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'very', 'tight', 'story', 'centered', 'not', 'action', 'melodrama', 'subtle', 'look', 'life', 'man', 'named', 'Finn', 'McBride', 'recommend', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'enjoyed', 'also', 'took', 'something', ""'m"", 'going', 'be', 'more', 'open-minded', 'choices', 'future', 'wound', 'up', 'being', 'very', 'glad', 'had', 'experienced', 'movie.9/10']",The Station Agent

It is a slow feel good film with no real direction nor any real ending.Fin, a four foot five inch small person, played by Peter Dinklage, has inherited an outpost dilapidated train Agent's Station in the wilds of New Jersey. This is a small desolate town, and the train station is right up Fin's alley. He is a man turned into himself, it appears after much teasing and bullying as a child and as an adult, he prefers time to himself. He has turned into a loner for self preservation.  He finds this agent station fits him well. And, then, comes along Joe, played by Bobby Cannavale, a high strung, talkative, Cuban who is running his dad's food truck. He parks the truck near Fin's new home, so coffee is readily available.  Fin is run into, literally, by Olivia, played by Patricia Clarkson.. She is an artist, mourning her lost marriage and her dead son. These three people come together, unusual friends, but each of them have a need that the other seems to fill. Fast friends they become after several stops and go. Chole, a young black girl is attracted to Fin, and he feels comfortable with her. Fin takes daily walks to learn about the town and to follow the trains, his obsession. Soon, his friends are walking with him. Through trials and tribulations, this film fills a need within all of us. The acting is superb, the filming lovely and the storyline, so important in this day and age of estrangement from each other.Highly Recommended.

815508,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0001WTWDI,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[5, 6]","The Station Agent (Tom McCarthy, 2003)It says something about the state of filmmaking and popular culture in America that The Station Agent won or was nominated for thirty-one awards at various places, including winning the BAFTA for Best Screenplay, the Audience award at Sundance (where it was also nominated for the Grand Jury Prize), and three Independent Spirit Awards, but between the Golden Globes and the Academy Awards, The Station Agent was nominated for, and won, zero. Perhaps someone at the Academy needs to put their ear a little closer to the ground, because all those other film societies really knew what they were doing here.The Station Agent is the story of Finbar McBride (indie favorite Peter Dinklage, of Safe Men and Living in Oblivion fame), a train enthusiast from north Jersey. Upon the death of his best friend Henry (Do the Right Thing's Paul Benjamin), he inherits an old train depot in Newfoundland, New Jersey. After the will's executor tells him there's nothing for miles around there, Fin moves down and sets up shop. He didn't however, count on the local hot dog stand setting up in his parking lot, run by the garrulous Joe (100 Centre St.'s Bobby Cannavale), eccentric artist Olivia (three-time-Best-Actress-award-winning Patricia Clarkson, recently in Wendigo, Far from Heaven, and The Safety of Objects), lonely town librarian Emily (Dawson's Creek alum Michelle Williams), or inquisitive schoolgirl Clea (Raven Goodwin of Lovely and Amazing, in her second screen appearance), all of whom latch onto Fin in different ways, and for different reasons. How's a guy to be left alone?This whole cast is simply tremendous, but it is Clarkson who truly shines. She always brings a touch of greatness to everything she touches. Goodwin proves herself a capahle enough actress at playing herself; hopefully we will soon have her in a role where she can show her talent. Cannavale and Dinklage make great foils for one another, and their energy does a good deal to move the story along. Put all of this together with the simplest of stories, how people interact, and you could end up with something stolid and motionless (like The Big Chill), or you could end up with something brilliant (like The Breakfast Club). The Station Agent falls, without a single toe over the line, on the side of brilliance. It takes a while to get going; twenty of the film's eighty-nine minutes are setup (and more was planned, judging by the deleted scenes, most of which are pieces of Fin and Henry's interaction; they're wonderful disembodied pieces, but would have dragged out an already-too-long beginning). But once you get the ball rolling, there is a great deal to be loved about The Station Agent. ****",4,One of the best films of 2003.,1090800000,"07 26, 2004",2004,2719,"['Station', 'Agent', 'Tom', 'McCarthy', '2003', 'something', 'state', 'filmmaking', 'popular', 'culture', 'America', 'Station', 'Agent', 'won', 'was', 'nominated', 'thirty-one', 'awards', 'various', 'places', 'including', 'winning', 'BAFTA', 'Best', 'Screenplay', 'Audience', 'award', 'Sundance', 'where', 'was', 'also', 'nominated', 'Grand', 'Jury', 'Prize', 'three', 'Independent', 'Spirit', 'Awards', 'Golden', 'Globes', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'Station', 'Agent', 'was', 'nominated', 'won', 'zero', 'Perhaps', 'someone', 'Academy', 'put', 'ear', 'little', 'closer', 'ground', 'other', 'film', 'societies', 'really', 'knew', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'here.The', 'Station', 'Agent', 'story', 'Finbar', 'McBride', 'indie', 'favorite', 'Peter', 'Dinklage', 'Safe', 'Men', 'Living', 'Oblivion', 'fame', 'train', 'enthusiast', 'north', 'Jersey', 'death', 'best', 'friend', 'Henry', 'Do', 'Right', 'Thing', 'Paul', 'Benjamin', 'old', 'train', 'depot', 'Newfoundland', 'New', 'Jersey', 'will', 'executor', 'nothing', 'miles', 'there', 'Fin', 'down', 'up', 'shop', 'did', ""n't"", 'however', 'count', 'local', 'hot', 'dog', 'stand', 'setting', 'up', 'parking', 'lot', 'run', 'garrulous', 'Joe', '100', 'Centre', 'St.', 'Bobby', 'Cannavale', 'eccentric', 'artist', 'Olivia', 'three-time-Best-Actress-award-winning', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'recently', 'Wendigo', 'Far', 'Heaven', 'Safety', 'Objects', 'lonely', 'town', 'librarian', 'Emily', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'alum', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'inquisitive', 'schoolgirl', 'Clea', 'Raven', 'Goodwin', 'Lovely', 'Amazing', 'second', 'screen', 'appearance', 'whom', 'latch', 'Fin', 'different', 'ways', 'different', 'reasons', 'How', 'guy', 'be', 'left', 'alone', 'whole', 'cast', 'simply', 'tremendous', 'Clarkson', 'who', 'truly', 'shines', 'always', 'touch', 'greatness', 'everything', 'Goodwin', 'capahle', 'enough', 'actress', 'playing', 'hopefully', 'will', 'soon', 'have', 'role', 'where', 'can', 'show', 'talent', 'Cannavale', 'Dinklage', 'make', 'great', 'foils', 'one', 'energy', 'good', 'deal', 'move', 'story', 'along', 'Put', 'together', 'simplest', 'stories', 'how', 'people', 'interact', 'could', 'end', 'up', 'something', 'stolid', 'motionless', 'Big', 'Chill', 'could', 'end', 'up', 'something', 'brilliant', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'Station', 'Agent', 'single', 'toe', 'line', 'side', 'brilliance', 'while', 'get', 'going', 'twenty', 'film', 'eighty-nine', 'minutes', 'are', 'setup', 'more', 'was', 'planned', 'judging', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'most', 'are', 'pieces', 'Fin', 'Henry', 'interaction', ""'re"", 'wonderful', 'disembodied', 'pieces', 'would', 'have', 'dragged', 'out', 'already-too-long', 'beginning', 'once', 'get', 'ball', 'rolling', 'great', 'deal', 'be', 'loved', 'Station', 'Agent', '****']",The Station Agent
815509,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,B0001WTWDI,Robert Morris,"[67, 77]","I do not damn with faint praise when calling this a ""small"" film, nor when doing so is any offense intended to Peter Dinklage who plays the role of Finbar McBride, the central character. After the death of his employer and friend who owns a store offering model railroads and various accessories, McBride learns that he has inherited from him an abandoned train station and sets out on foot to begin a new life there. Only four-foot tall, by now he has endured all of the hurtful jokes and taunts about dwarfs, ""Munchkins,"" etc. He seeks solitude in what seems to be an eminently appropriate residence, given his passion for railroading in all shapes and sizes. McBride arrives and establishes residence, determined to have minimal contact with others who live in the town nearby. Unexpectedly and at first reluctantly, he becomes friends with Joe Oramas (Bobby Cannavale) and then Olivia Harris (Patricia Clarkson), both of whom sense within McBride a stature belied by his diminutive body. This is a ""small"" film in the sense that under Thomas McCarthy's brilliant direction, it is fully developed within quite limited parameters. (I am reminded of the fact that the greatest athletes ""play within themselves."") I can think of nothing to delete from this film, nor of anything to add. Also, to their credit,  McCarthy and his cast resist every opportunity to sentimentalize (thereby trivialize) any of the lead characters' weaknesses as well as strengths. Finbar, Olivia, and Joe struggle (with mixed success) in their relationships with each other. Their behavior is not always admirable. But separately and together, they celebrate the nature of humanity, whatever the shape and form of it may prove to be.",5,A Celebration of Humanity,1077753600,"02 26, 2004",2004,1710,"['do', 'not', 'damn', 'faint', 'praise', 'when', 'calling', 'small', 'film', 'when', 'doing', 'so', 'offense', 'intended', 'Peter', 'Dinklage', 'who', 'role', 'Finbar', 'McBride', 'central', 'character', 'death', 'employer', 'friend', 'who', 'store', 'offering', 'model', 'railroads', 'various', 'accessories', 'McBride', 'inherited', 'abandoned', 'train', 'station', 'out', 'foot', 'begin', 'new', 'life', 'there', 'Only', 'four-foot', 'tall', 'now', 'endured', 'hurtful', 'jokes', 'taunts', 'dwarfs', 'Munchkins', 'etc', 'solitude', 'what', 'be', 'eminently', 'appropriate', 'residence', 'given', 'passion', 'railroading', 'shapes', 'sizes', 'McBride', 'residence', 'determined', 'have', 'minimal', 'contact', 'others', 'who', 'live', 'town', 'nearby', 'Unexpectedly', 'first', 'reluctantly', 'friends', 'Joe', 'Oramas', 'Bobby', 'Cannavale', 'then', 'Olivia', 'Harris', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'whom', 'sense', 'McBride', 'stature', 'belied', 'diminutive', 'body', 'small', 'film', 'sense', 'Thomas', 'McCarthy', 'brilliant', 'direction', 'fully', 'developed', 'quite', 'limited', 'parameters', 'am', 'reminded', 'fact', 'greatest', 'athletes', 'play', 'can', 'think', 'nothing', 'delete', 'film', 'anything', 'add', 'Also', 'credit', 'McCarthy', 'cast', 'resist', 'opportunity', 'sentimentalize', 'thereby', 'trivialize', 'lead', 'characters', 'weaknesses', 'as', 'well', 'strengths', 'Finbar', 'Olivia', 'Joe', 'struggle', 'mixed', 'success', 'relationships', 'other', 'behavior', 'not', 'always', 'admirable', 'separately', 'together', 'celebrate', 'nature', 'humanity', 'shape', 'form', 'may', 'prove', 'be']",The Station Agent

815511,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0001WTWDI,Roland E. Zwick,"[6, 7]","Thomas McCarthy's ""The Station Agent"" is a joyous and wondrous tale of three rather unique and quirky individuals whose lives intersect at an abandoned train depot in rural New Jersey.When a dwarf named Fin inherits the station from a business partner, he moves there, hoping to find a place where he will finally be free from all the prying eyes, pointing fingers and knowing smiles he's been subjected to all his life.  However, Fin finds that, even in isolation, it's not always easy to be alone.  As soon as he takes up residence in his new abode, he meets up with Olivia and Joe, two people with whom he seems to have little in common, but with whom he manages to forge a lasting friendship.  Olivia is a struggling artist who lost her young son two years earlier in a freak accident.  Grief-stricken and trying to put the pieces of her life back together, Olivia experiences major mood swings that make it hard for others to get close to her, no matter how hard they try.  Fin, likewise, is a shy, taciturn young man who has pretty much given up the possibility that he will ever be able to have a ""normal"" relationship with other people (let alone women). Thus, he turns inward, throwing up barriers in an effort to keep people out of his life, hoping that, by doing so, he will avoid getting hurt any further.  Joe, on the other hand, is a garrulous young Cuban who runs a hot dog stand right outside Fin's station, a man who chatters on endlessly about any subject and sees nothing wrong with forcing himself into Fin's life, blithely unaware that his company is the last thing Fin wants.  Yet, Joe is so openhearted and good-natured that even Fin, though desperately craving privacy and silence, hasn't the heart to dampen the young man's desire for companionship and friendship.  Somehow, through the trials and tribulations of daily living, these three strangers develop a bond of friendship, love and mutual support.The set-up for ""The Station Agent"" could have led to any number of serious pitfalls, given its potential for unbridled quirkiness and feel-good sentimentality  However, McCarthy has managed to walk that fine line between preciousness and charm, contrivance and originality, calculation and spontaneity.  He has fashioned an adroit screenplay filled with likable characters, rueful humor, clever one-liners and restrained slapstick.  The film is less concerned with storyline and plot than it is with tone, mood and character interaction.  Throughout the film, we seem to be eavesdropping on the lives of these people, understanding that we will never fully know all the life experiences that have gone into making them the people they are today, but happy to spend just this little bit of time with them anyway.""The Station Agent"" is a masterpiece of fine acting, with Peter Dinklage, Patricia Clarkson and Bobby Cannavale delivering pitch-perfect, bell-ringing performances.  As the reticent dwarf, Dinklage is particularly brilliant at creating a character out of little more than body language and facial expressions.  His work here offers definitive proof that some of the greatest acting and character development can be accomplished with a minimum of dialogue.",4,a genuine charmer,1102896000,"12 13, 2004",2004,3195,"['Thomas', 'McCarthy', 'Station', 'Agent', 'joyous', 'wondrous', 'tale', 'three', 'rather', 'unique', 'quirky', 'individuals', 'lives', 'intersect', 'abandoned', 'train', 'depot', 'rural', 'New', 'Jersey.When', 'dwarf', 'named', 'Fin', 'station', 'business', 'partner', 'there', 'hoping', 'find', 'place', 'where', 'will', 'finally', 'be', 'free', 'prying', 'eyes', 'pointing', 'fingers', 'knowing', 'smiles', 'been', 'subjected', 'life', 'However', 'Fin', 'even', 'isolation', 'not', 'always', 'easy', 'be', 'alone', 'As', 'soon', 'up', 'residence', 'new', 'abode', 'up', 'Olivia', 'Joe', 'two', 'people', 'whom', 'have', 'little', 'common', 'whom', 'forge', 'lasting', 'friendship', 'Olivia', 'struggling', 'artist', 'who', 'lost', 'young', 'son', 'two', 'years', 'earlier', 'freak', 'accident', 'Grief-stricken', 'trying', 'put', 'pieces', 'life', 'back', 'together', 'Olivia', 'major', 'mood', 'swings', 'make', 'hard', 'others', 'get', 'close', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'try', 'Fin', 'likewise', 'shy', 'taciturn', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'pretty', 'much', 'given', 'up', 'possibility', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'able', 'have', 'normal', 'relationship', 'other', 'people', 'let', 'alone', 'women', 'Thus', 'inward', 'throwing', 'up', 'barriers', 'effort', 'keep', 'people', 'life', 'hoping', 'doing', 'so', 'will', 'avoid', 'getting', 'hurt', 'further', 'Joe', 'other', 'hand', 'garrulous', 'young', 'Cuban', 'who', 'hot', 'dog', 'stand', 'right', 'Fin', 'station', 'man', 'who', 'endlessly', 'subject', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'forcing', 'Fin', 'life', 'blithely', 'unaware', 'company', 'last', 'thing', 'Fin', 'Joe', 'so', 'openhearted', 'good-natured', 'even', 'Fin', 'though', 'desperately', 'craving', 'privacy', 'silence', ""n't"", 'heart', 'dampen', 'young', 'man', 'desire', 'companionship', 'friendship', 'Somehow', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'daily', 'living', 'three', 'strangers', 'develop', 'bond', 'friendship', 'love', 'mutual', 'support.The', 'set-up', 'Station', 'Agent', 'could', 'have', 'led', 'number', 'serious', 'pitfalls', 'given', 'potential', 'unbridled', 'quirkiness', 'feel-good', 'sentimentality', 'However', 'McCarthy', 'managed', 'walk', 'fine', 'line', 'preciousness', 'charm', 'contrivance', 'originality', 'calculation', 'spontaneity', 'fashioned', 'adroit', 'screenplay', 'filled', 'likable', 'characters', 'rueful', 'humor', 'clever', 'one-liners', 'restrained', 'slapstick', 'film', 'less', 'concerned', 'storyline', 'plot', 'tone', 'mood', 'character', 'interaction', 'film', 'seem', 'be', 'eavesdropping', 'lives', 'people', 'understanding', 'will', 'never', 'fully', 'know', 'life', 'experiences', 'have', 'gone', 'making', 'people', 'are', 'today', 'happy', 'spend', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'time', 'anyway', 'Station', 'Agent', 'masterpiece', 'fine', 'acting', 'Peter', 'Dinklage', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'Bobby', 'Cannavale', 'delivering', 'pitch-perfect', 'bell-ringing', 'performances', 'reticent', 'dwarf', 'Dinklage', 'particularly', 'brilliant', 'creating', 'character', 'little', 'more', 'body', 'language', 'facial', 'expressions', 'work', 'here', 'definitive', 'proof', 'greatest', 'acting', 'character', 'development', 'can', 'be', 'accomplished', 'minimum', 'dialogue']",The Station Agent

Each character can be as complex as you want it to be. Only a tiny facet of each character has been exposed and the remaining facets are for the viewer to imagine and explore.The movie revolves around Fin (Peter Dinklage), who has retired from active service and by happenstance inherited  (from a close friend) a railway depot in remote Newfoundland. Fin runs into a an extrovert Joe (Bobby Cannavale) who reluctantly runs a mobile coffee & snack shop. Fin has a strange friend in the form of Olivia (Patricia Clarkson) who is going through an on-the-brink marriage.

Although he makes it abundantly clear he craves isolation, a three-way friendship soon develops between him, a troubled local artist and an outgoing Cuban lunch wagon owner.Peter Dinklage plays the taciturn young man in THE STATION AGENT, a charming, big-splash indy production from 2003.  Bobby Cannavale and Patricia Clarkson form the other sides of the rather unlikely triangle.  Nothing much happens in this movie - Finbar, the Dinklage character, is a train fanatic who wears an old railroad watch and spends many an afternoon watching trains pass by.  Joe (Cannavale) is like a big puppy dog, eager to break through the fence Finbar has build around himself.  Olivia (Clarkson) just happens to, er, run into Finbar a time or two and, like Joe, finds herself drawn to him.THE STATION AGENT is character driven, and the strong performances by the three stars compensate for a lack of plot or major emotional peaks.  There's almost too much subtextual stuff going on here, though.  For instance, Dinklage is a dwarf, or afflicted with dwarfism, or whatever the correct term is nowadays, and I think we're supposed to realize that fact contributed to his decision to turn hermit after his best friend dies.  `I think' is the operative phrase here.  I think the outgoing Joe is attracted to Fin because `there aren't many cool people around.'  I think Olivia... well, I haven't quite figured her out yet, but Clarkson makes of her such an appealing and interesting character, a flighty core personality further distracted by a loss the movie slowly reveals, that I stopped worrying about it.There's a nice commentary track with the three stars and director Thomas McCarthy.

""Pop Culture Addict""","[6, 21]","Thomas McCarthy's ""The Station Agent"" is proof positive that having appealing characters in a film is not enough to make the film itself appealing.  With nothing happening here to drive events forward, the characters in this production just find themselves adrift in a one-way narrative trip to nowhere.Finbar McBride (Peter Dinklage) inherits an abandoned train depot and relocates himself there in order to keep some distance between him and the outside world.  Finbar's dwarfism oftentimes attracts unwanted attention but he is able to maintain a sense of comfort in the sanctuary of the train depot.  His isolation, however, proves to be short-lived as Joe Oramas (Bobby Cannavale), a mobile coffee-cart vendor who does business in front of the depot, develops a friendship with Finbar.  This friendship eventually expands to include a third person as a local artist named Olivia Harris (Patricia Clarkson) starts to keep company with the two men.""The Station Agent"" succeeds in the task of character development as it creates charming and likeable characters but it fails as a film because it gives these characters nothing to do.  What passes for a story is essentially just a series of small conversations about everyday affairs.  There is an underlying charm in watching Finbar, Joe, and Olivia come together but charm can only take matters so far.  There is no over-arching storyline, there is no journey of self-discovery, and there is no dramatic transformation of any of the characters.  In short, there is nothing present in the story of to give the film any sense of purpose.  Dinklage is wonderful and hopefully other productions will see fit to make better use of his talents.  Cannavale, Clarkson, along with Raven Goodwin and Michelle Williams also do splendid work.

Fin, a dwarf who inherits a railroad station, Joe, the Cuban roach coach vendor that parks across the way, and Olivia, the troubled artist that has just come off the loss of a son to Reaper and a husband to divorce.Fin is played intensely and to perfection, and Olivia is a rather daffy artist with very real demons that rend the heart. Joe, however, steals the show. The outgoing one of the bunch, he practically forces the other two into the friendship, and his charisma, kind heart, and spastic personality are a delight to watch.

815546,A3B9BX6ZL633O9,B0001WTWDI,SwellBooks,"[4, 6]","This is truly a wonderful film and easily the best of 2003!Last summer was a pretty dismal one for me, film-wise. It seems I was seeing one bad film after another, culminating in the ghastly ""THE HULK"".Then last fall I saw John Sayles' latest film ""CASA DE LOS BABYS"" and this magical work of art and felt refreshed. These two films convinced me that there were filmmakers out there still interested in telling good stories filled with wonderful and interesting human beings.I won't dwell too much on the story but let you discover it for yourself. Just let me say that its about a young man named Fin who is a dwarf. He has withdrawn from the cruel world that has taunted and mad fun of him all his life and has turned his passion to trains. This film beautifully depicts his meeting with a number of fellow humans also cast adrift and alone in their lives.This is a film you simply must see if you haven't yet. And this DVD presentation is a good place to discover it. The anamorphic widescreen picture is clear and sharp and the soundtrack is quite pleasing to the ear. The extras are a few deleted scenes ( mostly from the films beginning ) and a commentary track with the brillant writer/ director Tom McCarthy and his three leading players, Peter Dinklage, Patricia Clarkson and Bobby Cannavale that is not as informative or insightful as one might like. McCarthy did not talk at all about the genesis of the film, where he got the idea, etc. And none of the actors talked about their wonderful characters or what attracted them to the film. Still, it is good to listen to once if only to see this great film again!Today, the word ""masterpiece"" or ""classic"" are thrown around too easily ( it seems every film that comes out is a masterpiece or an instant classic, if you believe the hype ), but this is one film that I can truthfully and with full confidence say is a masterpiece and destined to become a classic!Please, if you haven't seen it, see it, I know that if you love great films, you'll love this! And if you have seen it and love it, you've probably already bought this DVD and don't need my recommendation. But I will shout it to the rooftops for all to hear- THIS FILM IS A TREASURE! - George Bauch.",5,"""THE BEST FILM OF 2003""",1087171200,"06 14, 2004",2004,2218,"['truly', 'wonderful', 'film', 'easily', 'best', '2003', 'Last', 'summer', 'was', 'pretty', 'dismal', 'one', 'film-wise', 'was', 'seeing', 'one', 'bad', 'film', 'culminating', 'ghastly', 'HULK', '.Then', 'last', 'fall', 'saw', 'John', 'Sayles', 'latest', 'film', 'CASA', 'DE', 'LOS', 'BABYS', 'magical', 'work', 'art', 'felt', 'refreshed', 'two', 'films', 'convinced', 'were', 'filmmakers', 'there', 'still', 'interested', 'telling', 'good', 'stories', 'filled', 'wonderful', 'interesting', 'human', 'beings.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'dwell', 'too', 'much', 'story', 'let', 'discover', 'Just', 'let', 'say', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Fin', 'who', 'dwarf', 'withdrawn', 'cruel', 'world', 'taunted', 'mad', 'fun', 'life', 'turned', 'passion', 'trains', 'film', 'beautifully', 'meeting', 'number', 'fellow', 'humans', 'also', 'cast', 'adrift', 'alone', 'lives.This', 'film', 'simply', 'must', 'see', 'have', ""n't"", 'yet', 'DVD', 'presentation', 'good', 'place', 'discover', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'picture', 'clear', 'sharp', 'soundtrack', 'quite', 'pleasing', 'ear', 'extras', 'are', 'few', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'mostly', 'films', 'beginning', 'commentary', 'track', 'brillant', 'writer/', 'director', 'Tom', 'McCarthy', 'three', 'leading', 'players', 'Peter', 'Dinklage', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'Bobby', 'Cannavale', 'not', 'informative', 'insightful', 'one', 'might', 'like', 'McCarthy', 'did', 'not', 'talk', 'genesis', 'film', 'where', 'got', 'idea', 'etc', 'none', 'actors', 'talked', 'wonderful', 'characters', 'what', 'attracted', 'film', 'Still', 'good', 'listen', 'once', 'only', 'see', 'great', 'film', 'again', 'Today', 'word', 'masterpiece', 'classic', 'are', 'thrown', 'too', 'easily', 'film', 'out', 'masterpiece', 'instant', 'classic', 'believe', 'hype', 'one', 'film', 'can', 'truthfully', 'full', 'confidence', 'say', 'masterpiece', 'destined', 'become', 'classic', 'Please', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'see', 'know', 'love', 'great', 'films', ""'ll"", 'love', 'have', 'seen', 'love', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'already', 'bought', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'recommendation', 'will', 'shout', 'rooftops', 'hear-', 'THIS', 'FILM', 'TREASURE', 'George', 'Bauch']",The Station Agent

A story of lonely people who find out it is easier to be lonely with other people...The story of Finibar Mcbride (Peter Dinklage), a dwarf, is presented in short scenes, revealing his story without using many words, just bringing small details which make up his life story. One of the opening scenes shows Finn working at the ""Golden Spike"", a train repair store. A child walks in and is surprised to see the short Finn. His surprised reaction is only the first of many reactions to be revealed to the viewers and there comes a point when these reactions are hard on the viewer just as they are on Finn and one can understand his need to build a ""protective shield"" against the world . These reactions also build up our understanding of the bar scene further on through the movie. The store owner, who by small gestures is understood to be protective towards Finn is part of the secluded secure world Finn has created for himself. Not a lot of talk (one of the ""deleted scenes"" shows a lunch scene where each one sits alone and reads his newspaper), mutual love for trains and a regular fixed day pattern. This pattern is shattered when the store owner dies and leaves Finn a train station in the New Jersey rural area. This is the beginning of a new life for Finn who unwillingly finds himself dragged to a new friendship with two characters. Olivia Harris (the great Patricia Clarkson with whom I fell in love in ""Pieces of April""), a woman trying to overcome a loss and Joe Oramas (Bobby Cannavale) a young talkative character whose coffee stand is just near Finn's new house. The building of the relationship and eventually a small change in Finn is brought about by small details and touching moments.My ""movie experience"" was profoundly enriched by the additions part of the DVD which really gives you a better understanding of the movie and the characters. Sort of a further layer of understanding.  I really enjoyed the deleted scenes part, amongst which I would like to mention a scene which is a different ending for the movie. This beautiful scene shows Joe and Olivia sitting reading next to Finn's house (Finn is missing from this scene) and discussing Finn's purchase of a mobile phone and Joe's father which has returned to work. This scene is done in the same style of the real ending scene (giving some optimistic hope for the future) but also showing a glimpse of Olivia's better mental state (she is going to have her brother and his kids for the weekend). These deleted scenes were a real pleasure to watch. Another feature which I immensely enjoyed is a viewing of the movie with the comments of the director and the three main characters. First of all I liked to hear the conversation between the actors and to be a participant to their private jokes . This discussion is especially entertaining as the good chemistry amongst the three is very evident and includes Patricia's clarkson giggles and laughs and a very large part of the internal ""behind the scenes atmosphere"" which I believe is typical of a low budget movie such as this one. The team discusses a lot of ""on the spot"" decisions, changes and additions due to technical problems. It was interesting to hear about the enormous help received from friends (who did their parts for free, so I understand) and to see the point of view of those from within (the director for example was very concerned that the letter received by Finn did not resemble a real bill).  I think I could really understand how the parts were really shaped up by the characters. I was also touched by their comments or silence, such as the director telling us how Patricia Clarkson was glad to end her scenes ""inside the house"", as they were so intense.",5,Lovely DVD additions part,1100476800,"11 15, 2004",2004,3837,"['small', 'big', 'movie', 'many', 'nuances', 'great', 'actors', 'lovely', 'scenery', 'adding', 'up', 'make', 'unique', 'experience', 'story', 'lonely', 'people', 'who', 'find', 'easier', 'be', 'lonely', 'other', 'people', 'story', 'Finibar', 'Mcbride', 'Peter', 'Dinklage', 'dwarf', 'presented', 'short', 'scenes', 'revealing', 'story', 'using', 'many', 'words', 'just', 'bringing', 'small', 'details', 'make', 'up', 'life', 'story', 'One', 'opening', 'scenes', 'Finn', 'working', 'Golden', 'Spike', 'train', 'repair', 'store', 'child', 'walks', 'surprised', 'see', 'short', 'Finn', 'surprised', 'reaction', 'only', 'first', 'many', 'reactions', 'be', 'revealed', 'viewers', 'point', 'when', 'reactions', 'are', 'hard', 'viewer', 'just', 'are', 'Finn', 'one', 'can', 'understand', 'need', 'build', 'protective', 'shield', 'world', 'reactions', 'also', 'build', 'up', 'understanding', 'bar', 'scene', 'further', 'movie', 'store', 'owner', 'who', 'small', 'gestures', 'understood', 'be', 'protective', 'towards', 'Finn', 'part', 'secluded', 'secure', 'world', 'Finn', 'created', 'Not', 'lot', 'talk', 'one', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'lunch', 'scene', 'where', 'one', 'alone', 'reads', 'newspaper', 'mutual', 'love', 'trains', 'regular', 'fixed', 'day', 'pattern', 'pattern', 'shattered', 'when', 'store', 'owner', 'dies', 'Finn', 'train', 'station', 'New', 'Jersey', 'rural', 'area', 'beginning', 'new', 'life', 'Finn', 'who', 'unwillingly', 'dragged', 'new', 'friendship', 'two', 'characters', 'Olivia', 'Harris', 'great', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'whom', 'fell', 'love', 'Pieces', 'April', 'woman', 'trying', 'overcome', 'loss', 'Joe', 'Oramas', 'Bobby', 'Cannavale', 'young', 'talkative', 'character', 'coffee', 'stand', 'just', 'Finn', 'new', 'house', 'building', 'relationship', 'eventually', 'small', 'change', 'Finn', 'brought', 'small', 'details', 'touching', 'moments.My', 'movie', 'experience', 'was', 'profoundly', 'enriched', 'additions', 'part', 'DVD', 'really', 'better', 'understanding', 'movie', 'characters', 'Sort', 'further', 'layer', 'understanding', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'part', 'amongst', 'would', 'like', 'mention', 'scene', 'different', 'ending', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'scene', 'shows', 'Joe', 'Olivia', 'sitting', 'reading', 'next', 'Finn', 'house', 'Finn', 'missing', 'scene', 'discussing', 'Finn', 'purchase', 'mobile', 'phone', 'Joe', 'father', 'returned', 'work', 'scene', 'done', 'same', 'style', 'real', 'ending', 'scene', 'giving', 'optimistic', 'hope', 'future', 'also', 'showing', 'glimpse', 'Olivia', 'better', 'mental', 'state', 'going', 'have', 'brother', 'kids', 'weekend', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'were', 'real', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'feature', 'immensely', 'enjoyed', 'viewing', 'movie', 'comments', 'director', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'First', 'liked', 'hear', 'conversation', 'actors', 'be', 'participant', 'private', 'jokes', 'discussion', 'especially', 'entertaining', 'good', 'chemistry', 'amongst', 'three', 'very', 'evident', 'Patricia', 'clarkson', 'giggles', 'laughs', 'very', 'large', 'part', 'internal', 'scenes', 'atmosphere', 'believe', 'typical', 'low', 'budget', 'movie', 'such', 'one', 'team', 'lot', 'spot', 'decisions', 'changes', 'additions', 'due', 'technical', 'problems', 'was', 'interesting', 'hear', 'enormous', 'help', 'received', 'friends', 'who', 'did', 'parts', 'free', 'so', 'understand', 'see', 'point', 'view', 'director', 'example', 'was', 'very', 'concerned', 'letter', 'received', 'Finn', 'did', 'not', 'resemble', 'real', 'bill', 'think', 'could', 'really', 'understand', 'how', 'parts', 'were', 'really', 'shaped', 'up', 'characters', 'was', 'also', 'touched', 'comments', 'silence', 'such', 'director', 'telling', 'how', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'was', 'glad', 'end', 'scenes', 'house', 'were', 'so', 'intense']",The Station Agent

It sounds like a comedy, but THE STATION AGENT isn't a comedy.  Instead, it's a smart and slightly quirky drama written and directed by Thomas McCarthy about community and fellowship.Fin McBride is a train lover who works in a model railroad shop in Hoboken, New Jersey.  One day his boss (and only real friend) dies.  In his will he leaves Fin the deed and title to an abandoned train depot in Newfoundland, New Jersey.  Fin has had enough of being looked down upon by humanity and decides to begin a new life and moves into the station as his new home.  His desire for solitude is broken soon after arriving by Joe Oramas (Bobby Cannavale) a Cuban-American who's running his father's hot dog while his dad recovers from illness.  Besides Joe, there's also Olivia Harris (Patricia Clarkson), an eccentric and needy, but beautiful artist who has been separated from her husband ever since the accidental death of their son.  Joe just wants a friend and he really likes the new guy and Olivia just needs the companionship of people in general, feeling that their presence shields her from her own suffering.None of these individuals are perfect, but as the movie progresses we are given a glimpse into the nature of grace and beauty and importance of community.  After hears of being ostracized by most in society, Finn felt he could do life on his own, but he really couldn't.  No man is an island.  Joe is a lonely guy looking for some adventure, a break from the monotony that his duty as a loyal son has brought him and he gains that through his friendship with Fin.  Olivia is a woman with some very deep emotional and psychological problems.  She is afraid to face those problems, but is able to do so through her friendship with Fin and Joe.THE STATION AGENT is a small, brilliant film.  The acting is of Oscar quality (though the movie was largely ignored) and the performances are superb.  After watching the film, one is left with a feeling of longing to have friends such as these.  There's not much of a plot and the movie is more of a snapshot of the lives of these characters upon their first interactions.  The pace of the movie moves along like the third bowl of porridge that Goldilocks tries: not too hot, not too cold, but just right. Not everyone will enjoy watching THE STATION AGENT. It's not a movie that includes lots of action, car chases, explosions, or nudity.  Instead, it is a drama full of characterization and emotion illustrating a deep understanding of what it means to be alive.",5,A Dwarf Walks Into a Bar...,1158796800,"09 21, 2006",2006,2909,"['Taken', 'context', 'premise', 'STATION', 'AGENT', 'could', 'be', 'set-up', 'great', 'joke', 'dwarf', 'who', 'used', 'be', 'train', 'engineer', 'worked', 'model', 'train', 'store', 'old', 'train', 'station', 'Newfoundland', 'New', 'Jersey', 'decides', 'live', 'life', 'solitude', 'permanent', 'residence', 'pesty', 'Cuban', 'hot-dog', 'vendor', 'beautiful', 'female', 'artist', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'live', 'peace', 'comedy', 'STATION', 'AGENT', ""n't"", 'comedy', 'Instead', 'smart', 'slightly', 'quirky', 'drama', 'written', 'directed', 'Thomas', 'McCarthy', 'community', 'fellowship.Fin', 'McBride', 'train', 'lover', 'who', 'model', 'railroad', 'shop', 'Hoboken', 'New', 'Jersey', 'One', 'day', 'boss', 'only', 'real', 'friend', 'will', 'Fin', 'deed', 'title', 'abandoned', 'train', 'depot', 'Newfoundland', 'New', 'Jersey', 'Fin', 'had', 'enough', 'being', 'looked', 'down', 'upon', 'humanity', 'decides', 'begin', 'new', 'life', 'moves', 'station', 'new', 'home', 'desire', 'solitude', 'broken', 'soon', 'arriving', 'Joe', 'Oramas', 'Bobby', 'Cannavale', 'Cuban-American', 'who', 'running', 'father', 'hot', 'dog', 'dad', 'recovers', 'illness', 'Joe', 'also', 'Olivia', 'Harris', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'eccentric', 'needy', 'beautiful', 'artist', 'who', 'been', 'separated', 'husband', 'ever', 'accidental', 'death', 'son', 'Joe', 'just', 'friend', 'really', 'new', 'guy', 'Olivia', 'just', 'companionship', 'people', 'general', 'feeling', 'presence', 'own', 'suffering.None', 'individuals', 'are', 'perfect', 'movie', 'are', 'given', 'glimpse', 'nature', 'grace', 'beauty', 'importance', 'community', 'hears', 'being', 'ostracized', 'most', 'society', 'Finn', 'felt', 'could', 'do', 'life', 'own', 'really', 'could', ""n't"", 'man', 'island', 'Joe', 'lonely', 'guy', 'looking', 'adventure', 'break', 'monotony', 'duty', 'loyal', 'son', 'brought', 'gains', 'friendship', 'Fin', 'Olivia', 'woman', 'very', 'deep', 'emotional', 'psychological', 'problems', 'afraid', 'face', 'problems', 'able', 'do', 'so', 'friendship', 'Fin', 'Joe.THE', 'STATION', 'AGENT', 'small', 'brilliant', 'film', 'acting', 'Oscar', 'quality', 'movie', 'was', 'largely', 'ignored', 'performances', 'are', 'superb', 'watching', 'film', 'one', 'left', 'feeling', 'longing', 'have', 'friends', 'such', 'not', 'much', 'plot', 'movie', 'more', 'snapshot', 'lives', 'characters', 'upon', 'first', 'interactions', 'pace', 'movie', 'third', 'bowl', 'porridge', 'Goldilocks', 'tries', 'not', 'too', 'hot', 'not', 'too', 'cold', 'just', 'right', 'Not', 'everyone', 'will', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'STATION', 'AGENT', 'not', 'movie', 'lots', 'action', 'car', 'chases', 'explosions', 'nudity', 'Instead', 'drama', 'full', 'characterization', 'emotion', 'illustrating', 'deep', 'understanding', 'what', 'be', 'alive']",The Station Agent
815570,AGLL9FGGXRSH7,B0001WTWDI,"T. Williams ""world traveller""","[2, 4]","It was in my heart to embrace this movie. ""Quirky"" always attracts my attention. I had read the good reviews that hailed it as one of the best movies of the year. I've enjoyed Patricia Clarkson's previous work and have chuckled at Bobby Cannavale in the two or three things I have seen him in. I even passed some time with a student on his way back to Oxford who gushed over this movie.And yet ...The three leads are a compelling bunch. Writer/dirctor Tom McCarthy has gifted actor Peter Dinklage with a wonderful role that was neither sentimental nor condescending. Although the character is a dwarf, with very little tinkering his role could have been played by any actor. Dinklage offers up an ""everyman"" that has either chosen social isolation - or had it thrust upon him.Clarkson's performance is understatedly sexy, simple and selfless (pardon the alliteration). Her grieving artist is so casually presented (no Streep histrionics) that I could not help but feel as though I were observing a friend on home video, rather than watching an ""ACTOR"" crafting a character for the camera. Thus, it was disappointing to see her character do something so theatrical and contrived that it reminded me that I was watching a performance. (I won't even mention the misconceived outburst thrust upon Dinklage's character.)Cannavale is saddled an underwritten role. He is his usual charismatic self, but his character - basically an amiable ""puppy"" yapping at the heels of the two other characters - has no depth for him to explore. While not the most compelling, his character is the most likeable.  (I kept asking myself, what attracts his happy-go-lucky character to these other two wet rags?)These are three charming characters in search of a plotline. There is no story arc for any of the characters. Their motivations are muddled. Nothing happens. There is no resolution - it just stops as though they ran out of film. Admittedly, there are a couple of dramatic events, but they seem more like dramatic devices rather than illumination of the characters. Granted, real life is often full of the meaningless and mundane - but is reading train catalogs enough to propel a movie?The commentary provided by the director and three principals offers the inside scoop on making a low-budget film and is giggly and self-laudatory  enough to reveal that this was a pet project on which all had a good time.I wanted to be ""cool"" enough to love this indy movie - I am just not sure that this movie delivered on its end of the deal. Ultimately I decided to give it four stars rather than three because, even with its limited story appeal, the characters in this movie are more compelling than those who populate movies with 50 times the budget of this thinly-plotted film.",4,Parts better than the whole,1138579200,"01 30, 2006",2006,2758,"['was', 'heart', 'embrace', 'movie', 'Quirky', 'always', 'attention', 'had', 'read', 'good', 'reviews', 'hailed', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'year', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'previous', 'work', 'have', 'chuckled', 'Bobby', 'Cannavale', 'two', 'three', 'things', 'have', 'seen', 'even', 'passed', 'time', 'student', 'way', 'back', 'Oxford', 'who', 'gushed', 'movie.And', 'yet', 'three', 'leads', 'are', 'compelling', 'bunch', 'Writer/dirctor', 'Tom', 'McCarthy', 'gifted', 'actor', 'Peter', 'Dinklage', 'wonderful', 'role', 'was', 'sentimental', 'condescending', 'character', 'dwarf', 'very', 'little', 'tinkering', 'role', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'played', 'actor', 'Dinklage', 'up', 'everyman', 'chosen', 'social', 'isolation', 'had', 'thrust', 'him.Clarkson', 'performance', 'understatedly', 'sexy', 'simple', 'selfless', 'pardon', 'alliteration', 'grieving', 'artist', 'so', 'casually', 'presented', 'Streep', 'histrionics', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'feel', 'were', 'observing', 'friend', 'home', 'video', 'rather', 'watching', 'ACTOR', 'crafting', 'character', 'camera', 'Thus', 'was', 'disappointing', 'see', 'character', 'do', 'something', 'so', 'theatrical', 'contrived', 'reminded', 'was', 'watching', 'performance', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'mention', 'misconceived', 'outburst', 'thrust', 'Dinklage', 'character', 'Cannavale', 'saddled', 'underwritten', 'role', 'usual', 'charismatic', 'self', 'character', 'basically', 'amiable', 'puppy', 'yapping', 'heels', 'two', 'other', 'characters', 'depth', 'explore', 'not', 'most', 'compelling', 'character', 'most', 'likeable', 'kept', 'asking', 'what', 'happy-go-lucky', 'character', 'other', 'two', 'wet', 'rags', 'are', 'three', 'charming', 'characters', 'search', 'plotline', 'story', 'arc', 'characters', 'motivations', 'are', 'muddled', 'Nothing', 'resolution', 'just', 'ran', 'film', 'Admittedly', 'are', 'couple', 'dramatic', 'events', 'seem', 'more', 'dramatic', 'devices', 'rather', 'illumination', 'characters', 'Granted', 'real', 'life', 'often', 'full', 'meaningless', 'mundane', 'reading', 'train', 'catalogs', 'enough', 'propel', 'movie', 'commentary', 'provided', 'director', 'three', 'principals', 'inside', 'scoop', 'making', 'low-budget', 'film', 'giggly', 'self-laudatory', 'enough', 'reveal', 'was', 'pet', 'project', 'had', 'good', 'time.I', 'wanted', 'be', 'cool', 'enough', 'love', 'indy', 'movie', 'am', 'just', 'not', 'sure', 'movie', 'delivered', 'end', 'deal', 'Ultimately', 'decided', 'give', 'four', 'rather', 'three', 'even', 'limited', 'story', 'appeal', 'characters', 'movie', 'are', 'more', 'compelling', 'who', 'populate', 'movies', '50', 'times', 'budget', 'thinly-plotted', 'film']",The Station Agent

However, even for her, this was a let-down. Dinklage is fantastic in every scene, but the plot and other characters just aren't interesting enough to make for a full length film. Joe the Hot Dog vendor is funny and enjoyable to watch, but his character wasn't really believable (others have pointed out the complete lack of profit in selling $1 coffees and hot dogs in an area with what seems to be a population of 20 people). The artist love interest was quite a bit too old for Dinklage unless they were going for a May-December romance which is never addressed. Also, there just didn't seem to be anything extraordinary about her to make Dinklage endure her coldness, abuse, etc., or at least there wasn't for us when we were viewing the film. I think that the actors did the best they could with the script and the pacing, but the film is the classic ""Indie"" type where, while the characters are well crafted, there just isn't that much in terms of plot to hold the viewer's interest.

You remember that, right? Of course you do! The man who threw that challenge in the movie ""Elf,"" is Peter Dinklage, and in ""The Station Agent,"" he takes center stage. The story might be quite obvious, yet in the end, there is dignity, respect, and happy tears.Fin is a simple man, he's undersized, and quite frankly, he lives his own life, without a lot of outsiders invading it. When his best friend and boss/co-worker suddenly passes away, Fin is given a gift.You see, Fin does have a passion for trains, and his buddy gives him a train station that is in the middle of nowhere. That's perfect, because that means no company whatsoever, no people, no distractions, just Fin and himself. Right? Well, um, not exactly. Fin soon discovers that he has the most unexpected company that he couldn't possibly want to deal with! This was supposed to be his quiet time, and he's being disturbed with all these stupid people! Or are they stupid people? Fin soon discovers, despite his insecurity and vulnerability towards the rest of the human race, that there are people out there who have their hurts and challenges in life as well.This is so incredible, yet it is so simple. Have we forgotten how to treat people? Some of us have, and it really pisses me off sometimes! We treat people like garbage when they don't fit our standards, and we point fingers. This says you can learn to love again, and learn to put up with certain annoyances. And it packs a punch with such dignity, it'll blow your mind! If not?
