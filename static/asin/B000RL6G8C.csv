But this is probably the most laughless hour of ""comedy"" I've ever seen. Saget clearly has talent and a sense of humor (despite everything I still LIKE the guy)...but just as clearly he had no scripted act prepared, and seemed to feel that he could simply fill an hour by shouting out whatever random obscenities came into his head. Often, they didn't even seem to make sense to  Saget himself. It would be interesting to see what he could do with an actual routine...but this particular ""act"" was pretty much an insult to the audience.

Since I haven't seen any of his stand-up prior to this, I wasn't sure what to expect.  I saw the special, and I have to say, I do agree with most reviews, only to say, his jokes were there.  Some of which were very funny, although I wish he didn't apologize so much about it afterwards, and for some reason, I didn't care that he used so much dirty language.  The punchlines were funny, but the set-up, (like other reviews say) were too long which strayed from the funny of the joke.Anyways, I liked the special and yes, I really rated this 4 stars.  I did, very much, enjoy the 3 songs he performed at the end of his special.  The first song, very dirty but very funny.  The second song, for some reason I've heard it before, but also very funny.  The third song, a little less pop-sounding than I expected, but still funny.I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, although I would recommend you keep an open mind when you see this.

1082549,A3344EF67ZEJFN,B000RL6G8C,"J. D. Estrada ""Jokersurfer""","[4, 9]","After reading a few reviews and comparing notes with what some people here  had to say for Bob Saget's first HBO Special, I'm at a sort of crossroads in regards to how much I'm really willing to carve Saget a new hole. I'm not basing this on pity but instead on the answer to one simple question: ""Did I at least get a chuckle out of this?""The answer is a yes. It was never a gut busting laugh fest but the idea of Saget Calling Dave Coulier's hair a reverse Sting/Flock of Seagulls piece of crap or prompting audience members to ask Coulier if he shaves his balls was mildly entertaining. Possibly too mildly, maybe even Taco Bell Border Sauce Mild. When asked to describe his comedic style the problem with the term I'd use to describe it is that it sounds to chic or too smart. You be the judge. I say it's the closest to Streaming Consciousness of a perverted and molested thirteen year old boy. It's crude, it's random, segways are non existent and any excuse to say f*&k; is used and abused. Now, that's not to say I didn't laugh in various moments. Hell it's not even to say that I didn't enjoy it. I did, just mildly.It almost seems as if everything Saget has done could be chastised for being mild and it seems as such a BS word, but it does hold water often times. I saw Farce of the penguins and actually enjoyed it a lot because it's coarse, crude and random, but it worked. I saw the Aristocrats and enjoyed his version of the joke though I would have loved to have seen the versions from Richard Pryor, Bill Hicks, Rodney Dangerfield and Sam Kinison much more than Saget's full version, though I can see why it works for Saget. If it's all about stacking disgusting slurs one on top of the other to baffling heights and forgetting the uses of logic, then he's golden.As for a more grounded defense, I'd like to comment on what some people said as far as this being the worst standup in existence. I'd also like to bring forth a 4 star rating saying that the standup isn't everyone's cup of tea. First off, this is not the worst standup ever. Second off, I agree that this isn't everyone's cup of tea. You have to enjoy the hellish mish mash of random comments to get into Saget or at least this standup. Thirdly, though this is not everyone's cup of tea, it's also NOT a 4 star performance much less a five star performance. It's ok, it's watchable and to be fair with the guy, I'm sure if I see it a couple of times, I'll enjoy it a bit more, but quite frankly, Saget just wanted to kill his Danny Tanner nice guy Bob persona with one solid stab, and that just wasn't to be.You were a sitcom dad, you were a family show host, you made a boat load of money... this is your due payment. Who knows maybe he did a pound of cocaine before taking the stage hence him being so wired, but seems like he could always be that way. Again, it wasn't a total loss and to compare it to something you can understand, it's almost like one of those crappy movies you have to finish once you start watching.Danny Tanner might not be gay, but he's not hilarious either. that's what happens when you expect something, and get something totally different and half as cool as what you had in mind. Hell he even avoided the Aristocrat joke which was a cheap pop in the making if I've ever seen one. What I will give him though is that he's produced some interesting movies and I'm far more comfortable giving him money than Menc&iacute;a any day of my life.As for the whole making fun of shock value ploy, I'm not convinced that's it at all. Bob has been sold as one of the dirtiest comedians right now, and he migh have felt the pressure or something. Again, it has its moments and there are definite pieces worth quoting, but they are few and far in between each other.In short, though it's not the massive piece of dung some people herald it as, I'm not going to be sucking c*&k; to see it again.",2,Bob kinda sagged it,1189036800,"09 6, 2007",2007,3891,"['reading', 'few', 'reviews', 'comparing', 'notes', 'what', 'people', 'here', 'had', 'say', 'Bob', 'Saget', 'first', 'HBO', 'Special', ""'m"", 'sort', 'crossroads', 'regards', 'how', 'much', ""'m"", 'really', 'willing', 'carve', 'Saget', 'new', 'hole', ""'m"", 'not', 'basing', 'pity', 'instead', 'answer', 'one', 'simple', 'question', 'Did', 'least', 'get', 'chuckle', 'answer', 'yes', 'was', 'never', 'gut', 'busting', 'laugh', 'fest', 'idea', 'Saget', 'Calling', 'Dave', 'Coulier', 'hair', 'reverse', 'Sting/Flock', 'Seagulls', 'piece', 'crap', 'prompting', 'audience', 'members', 'ask', 'Coulier', 'balls', 'was', 'mildly', 'entertaining', 'Possibly', 'too', 'mildly', 'maybe', 'even', 'Taco', 'Bell', 'Border', 'Sauce', 'Mild', 'When', 'asked', 'describe', 'comedic', 'style', 'problem', 'term', ""'d"", 'use', 'describe', 'chic', 'too', 'smart', 'be', 'judge', 'say', 'closest', 'Streaming', 'Consciousness', 'perverted', 'molested', 'thirteen', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'crude', 'random', 'segways', 'are', 'non', 'existent', 'excuse', 'say', 'f*', 'k', 'used', 'abused', 'Now', 'not', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'various', 'moments', 'Hell', 'not', 'even', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'did', 'just', 'mildly.It', 'almost', 'everything', 'Saget', 'done', 'could', 'be', 'chastised', 'being', 'mild', 'such', 'BS', 'word', 'hold', 'water', 'often', 'saw', 'Farce', 'penguins', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'lot', 'coarse', 'crude', 'random', 'worked', 'saw', 'Aristocrats', 'enjoyed', 'version', 'joke', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'have', 'seen', 'versions', 'Richard', 'Pryor', 'Bill', 'Hicks', 'Rodney', 'Dangerfield', 'Sam', 'Kinison', 'much', 'more', 'Saget', 'full', 'version', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'Saget', 'stacking', 'disgusting', 'slurs', 'one', 'top', 'other', 'baffling', 'heights', 'forgetting', 'uses', 'logic', 'then', 'golden.As', 'more', 'grounded', 'defense', ""'d"", 'like', 'comment', 'what', 'people', 'said', 'as', 'far', 'being', 'worst', 'standup', 'existence', ""'d"", 'also', 'like', 'bring', 'forth', '4', 'star', 'rating', 'saying', 'standup', ""n't"", 'everyone', 'cup', 'tea', 'First', 'off', 'not', 'worst', 'standup', 'ever', 'Second', 'agree', ""n't"", 'everyone', 'cup', 'tea', 'have', 'enjoy', 'hellish', 'mish', 'mash', 'random', 'comments', 'get', 'Saget', 'least', 'standup', 'Thirdly', 'not', 'everyone', 'cup', 'tea', 'also', 'NOT', '4', 'star', 'performance', 'much', 'less', 'five', 'star', 'performance', 'ok', 'watchable', 'be', 'fair', 'guy', ""'m"", 'sure', 'see', 'couple', 'times', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'bit', 'more', 'quite', 'frankly', 'Saget', 'just', 'wanted', 'kill', 'Danny', 'Tanner', 'nice', 'guy', 'Bob', 'persona', 'one', 'solid', 'stab', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'be.You', 'were', 'sitcom', 'dad', 'were', 'family', 'show', 'host', 'made', 'boat', 'load', 'money', 'due', 'payment', 'Who', 'maybe', 'did', 'pound', 'cocaine', 'taking', 'stage', 'hence', 'being', 'so', 'wired', 'could', 'always', 'be', 'way', 'Again', 'was', ""n't"", 'total', 'loss', 'compare', 'something', 'can', 'understand', 'almost', 'one', 'crappy', 'movies', 'have', 'finish', 'once', 'start', 'watching.Danny', 'Tanner', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'gay', 'not', 'hilarious', 'either', 'what', 'when', 'expect', 'something', 'get', 'something', 'totally', 'different', 'half', 'as', 'cool', 'what', 'had', 'mind', 'Hell', 'even', 'avoided', 'Aristocrat', 'joke', 'was', 'cheap', 'pop', 'making', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'one', 'What', 'will', 'give', 'though', 'produced', 'interesting', 'movies', ""'m"", 'far', 'more', 'comfortable', 'giving', 'money', 'Menc', 'iacute', 'day', 'life.As', 'whole', 'making', 'fun', 'shock', 'value', 'ploy', ""'m"", 'not', 'convinced', 'Bob', 'been', 'sold', 'one', 'dirtiest', 'comedians', 'right', 'now', 'migh', 'have', 'felt', 'pressure', 'something', 'Again', 'moments', 'are', 'definite', 'pieces', 'worth', 'quoting', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'other.In', 'short', 'not', 'massive', 'piece', 'dung', 'people', 'herald', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'be', 'sucking', 'c*', 'k', 'see', 'again']",Bob Saget: That Ain't Right

He discusses living with his teenage daughters, an experience with a ""drive by heckler"" and his take on the ""Six Flags Guy"".Bob, at one point, even shouts!

Yeah! he's trippin' alright???!!! One of the worst stand-up shows ever! Don't waste your money or your time! This show is about as much fun as putting rubbing alcohol on jock itch!

Absolutely hysterical, made me lose my breath laughing.  When I saw him hosting the ""Funniest Home Videos"" show, I thought he was cute, somewhat dear, but still funny in a groaning, bad-pun-but-good-effort sort of way.Then came this travesty.  I understand that he was trying to be different, to shed the old family-man image.  But he just wasn't funny in this.  I don't mind obscenities, but these just basically seemed gratuitous -- he could have just stood there and strung together all the dirty words that came to mind and gotten the same effect.I keep wishing HBO would release those old ""One Night Stand"" shows on DVD, especially Bob Saget's.
