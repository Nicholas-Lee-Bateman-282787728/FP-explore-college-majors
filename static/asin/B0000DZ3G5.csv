779868,A3N8RZSXKN1OR2,B0000DZ3G5,Chrijeff,"[1, 1]","Swiftwater, Vermont, in the late 1920's is a quiet, isolated village where some people still get around by horse-and-buggy or shank's mare, and where the residents are perfectly satisfied to leave the outer world alone and have it return the favor.  Even the annual return of the migrating Canada geese--who don't always stop--isn't something they want to explout by encouraging outsiders to come in and hunt.  But to Cam Calloway (Brian Keith), a barrel-chested ""Irish Micmac"" who was raised with the Indians and still speaks of ""my brothers on the Reservation,"" the geese are more than just birds: they're a tribal totem, and he dreams of creating a sanctuary for them.  His son Bucky (Brandon deWilde) has picked up the idea from him, and the townsfolk call them ""those crazy Calloways""--about the only close friends they have are town gossip Alf Simes (Walter Brennan) and the Mellotts, Jim (John Larkin), who owns the general store, his wife Sarah (Renee Godfrey), and their 17-year-old daughter Bridie (Linda Evans), who's been Bucky's tomboy ""pal"" since she ""was old enough to fall out of apple trees.""  When travelling salesman Dell Fraser (Philip Abbott) learns of Cam's dream, he offers to get his boss, hardware magnate E. J. Fletcher (Roy Roberts), to pony up the money to buy the land for the sanctuary.  But Fraser has ulterior motives, as Cam and Bucky discover all too soon.  Meanwhile Bucky is forced to take over the family trap lines when Cam breaks his leg, and a drop in fur prices imperils the family's home and Cam's relationship with his beloved wife Liddy (Vera Miles).  Filmed in the gorgeous countryside of New England and full of small-town flavor--both bad and good--this is a highly enjoyable story of family, friendship, and dreams, and how unswerving resolution can change everything in time.",4,Conservationists ahead of their time,1269820800,"03 29, 2010",2010,1824,"['Swiftwater', 'Vermont', 'late', '1920', 'quiet', 'isolated', 'village', 'where', 'people', 'still', 'get', 'around', 'horse-and-buggy', 'shank', 'mare', 'where', 'residents', 'are', 'perfectly', 'satisfied', 'leave', 'outer', 'world', 'alone', 'have', 'return', 'favor', 'Even', 'annual', 'return', 'migrating', 'Canada', 'geese', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'stop', ""n't"", 'something', 'want', 'explout', 'encouraging', 'outsiders', 'come', 'hunt', 'Cam', 'Calloway', 'Brian', 'Keith', 'barrel-chested', 'Irish', 'Micmac', 'who', 'was', 'raised', 'Indians', 'still', 'speaks', 'brothers', 'Reservation', 'geese', 'are', 'more', 'just', 'birds', ""'re"", 'tribal', 'totem', 'creating', 'sanctuary', 'son', 'Bucky', 'Brandon', 'deWilde', 'picked', 'up', 'idea', 'townsfolk', 'call', 'crazy', 'Calloways', 'only', 'close', 'friends', 'have', 'are', 'town', 'gossip', 'Alf', 'Simes', 'Walter', 'Brennan', 'Mellotts', 'Jim', 'John', 'Larkin', 'who', 'general', 'store', 'wife', 'Sarah', 'Renee', 'Godfrey', '17-year-old', 'daughter', 'Bridie', 'Linda', 'Evans', 'who', 'been', 'Bucky', 'tomboy', 'pal', 'was', 'old', 'enough', 'fall', 'apple', 'trees', 'When', 'travelling', 'salesman', 'Dell', 'Fraser', 'Philip', 'Abbott', 'Cam', 'dream', 'get', 'boss', 'hardware', 'magnate', 'E.', 'J.', 'Fletcher', 'Roy', 'Roberts', 'pony', 'up', 'money', 'buy', 'land', 'sanctuary', 'Fraser', 'ulterior', 'motives', 'Cam', 'Bucky', 'discover', 'too', 'soon', 'Meanwhile', 'Bucky', 'forced', 'take', 'over', 'family', 'trap', 'lines', 'when', 'Cam', 'leg', 'drop', 'fur', 'prices', 'family', 'home', 'Cam', 'relationship', 'beloved', 'wife', 'Liddy', 'Vera', 'Miles', 'Filmed', 'gorgeous', 'countryside', 'New', 'England', 'full', 'small-town', 'flavor', 'bad', 'good', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'story', 'family', 'friendship', 'dreams', 'how', 'unswerving', 'resolution', 'can', 'change', 'everything', 'time']",N/A

779882,A6GMEO3VRY51S,B0000DZ3G5,microjoe,"[1, 1]","The Story: In a remote area of 1930's Vermont, a small town named Swiftwater is proud of their small town country atmosphere. They are happy behind the times and away from the hustle and bustle of big city life and tourism. All that changes when a traveling salesman discovers their town and the flocks of Canadian geese that fly over every year. He begins convincing the town they are sitting on a gold mine of hunter tourism potential. But he has to get past Cam Calloway (Brian Keith), a local trapper that many think is a crackpot for protecting the geese. His true friends think he is a hero as they know that if tourist sized groups of hunters move in they will lose their flocks.The Calloway family lives out in the woods in conditions not that far from a frontier lifestyle on land owned by the local land baron, quick to throw anyone off their land for a penny short on a payment. He hopes the Calloway's are late on their mortgage since he has loggers that want the land. Cam Calloway is part Indian and feels closeness to the land, but is a very poor man. While he is a trapper by trade, his tribal totem is the geese and he goes to great lengths to protect them. He uses a big chunk of their winter profit without discussing it with his wife first in order to put a down payment on some land for a sanctuary for the geese. But an unexpected sudden crash in the fur market causes him to lose the mortgage on his house. Naturally his wife is furious. His wife Liddy (played wonderfully Vera Miles) ebbs and flows from tolerance and understanding to frustration and rage. After losing the house, she pushes him to build a house on the new sanctuary land. When his building is slow going due to his focusing on his goose work, the family friends join together for an old-fashioned house raising and dance. In a welcome turn of events an anonymous philanthropist donates cash to help the sanctuary, but there are questionable motives at work, and the deceived Calloway fights back, risking his own life for his beloved geese.This movie has much more complicated relationships and characters than a typical Disney movie. Cam is a wonderful family man, but whenever things go really badly he starts drinking, he seems to ruin things for himself and the family. In the meantime their 18 year old son is trying to help his family, while trying to untangle his own tension and feelings about the girl Bridie (played by a teenage Linda Evans) that has been his life long pal, and is suddenly becoming a woman. Jealousy and confusion cause him to lash out in unexpected ways. His scenes when he is trapped in a wolverine den fighting for his life are action packed and suspenseful. All in all a wonderful film filled with good life lessons. Unlike other projects from the studio, the characters are not simply good and bad, but more like real people with failed aspirations, faults, combined with strengths that make them special. Romance, comedy, suspense, action, drama, nostalgia,.. this film has it all.BEHIND THE SCENES & TRIVIA: Walt Disney was still alive during production, and his influence on the film still shows. He was brave enough to make movies that did not fit into any existing category, or make a movie that was not ""typical"" for him. Brian Keith and Vera Miles are incredible in their complex shifting characters. The film is loaded with a strong group of supporting actors such as Ed Wynn and Walter Brennan. Directed by Norman Tokar, the screenplay was developed by studio regular Louis Pelletier from a book by ""Swiftwater"" by Paul Annixter"". Pelletier also worked on other Disney films including ""Big Red"", ""Follow Me Boys!"", and ""The Horse in the Grey Flannel Suit"". The inspiring musical score was composed by Oscar winning Max Steiner, famous for his compositions for Casablanca, Gone With the Wind, Treasure of the Sierra Madre and more. Well known for how highly he thought of himself, he advised the screenwriter, ""Don't worry young man, I'll save the the picture"". The famous composing Sherman Brothers wrote the songs ""Rhyme-Around"", and ""The Cabin-Raising Song"", both from the house raising scene. Studio animal trainer William Koehler trained the wolverine, bear, dog and other animals, (see his book ""The Wonderful World of Disney Animals""). The scene where Vera Miles beats a bear with a broom is quite real, the bear was terrified and took off running under her enthusiastic blows.Reviewers at the time raved about the authentic New England scenery with its seasonal colors, but very few shots were actually done on location. The hunting scenes and some establishing shots of the woods, geese flocks, and hills were shot in Vermont, but then the work moved to the Disney studio lot. The crew built the cabins, lake, and town at an area of the studio known as Berm five. Extensive matte shots (not by Peter Ellenshaw this time) helped for the backgrounds, and greensmen created hand painted trees and shrubs by coating live trees and shrubs with molasses to protect them, then spray painting the colors on them. Tons of liquid amber trees and elms were also planted on the studio lot. An 18"" lake was dug up and filled with water, then surrounded with 600 cornstalks to create the goose sanctuary. The interior sets were decorated by Emile Kuri, whose interior design work is in almost every Disney movie prior to Walt's death. Theatrically released on June 28, 1965 in Technicolor, the running time is 131 minutes. Four years later it aired on the ""Wonderful World of Disney"" anthology television show for the first time as one of the few 3 part episodes on January 12,19, and 26, 1969, and aired again in `74 and `78. The first video release was in 1985.",5,Very Different movie for Walt Disney Studios in 1965,1267488000,"03 2, 2010",2010,5691,"['Story', 'remote', 'area', '1930', 'Vermont', 'small', 'town', 'named',

I was raised on Disney and, as a boy, fifty years ago, i was captivated by the film,Those Calloways. i believe the story/film was well ahead of it's time with it's theme of the beauty and preservation of wildlife in this country. What has always stood out in my mind over these many years, was the beautiful music that had been coordinated with the graceful motion of the Canadian geese while in flight, so artfully done in the movie. So i was very surprised and pleased to discover that the music was composed by the great film composer, Mr Max Steiner who'd scored for a huge number of classic great films (one of his best known, being Gone With The Wind). i'd never heard of Steiner composing music for a Disnery film. Regarding the story, It was a pleasure to once again experience the warmth and pleasure of Those Calloways and i appreciated the opportunity to relive one of the pleasant memories of my childhood.

Renfro had made quite a few movies, and all were good. Brandon's career started in his youth with A MEMBER OF THE WEDDING. THOSE CALLOWAYS are for the whole family to enjoy.
