1264887,A1YB29BIDULEYE,B002E58FUG,"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch""","[1, 2]","I'm not the biggest fan of this series. So other reviewers might offer better insight. But like I said before, I think we miss a crucial point if we don't understand that while Archie is a bigot, he is on a journey that will eventually lead to acceptance and even love of groups he is bigoted against. (Remember, there are 9 seasons of AITF, and then 4 seasons of ""Archie's Place."")This 3rd season has what I consider 3 main focus episodes. The 1st is ""Archie and the Editorial."" This somewhat defines Archie's character. He is very anti gun control. His reasoning lacks virtually any rational thought. (Though it is funny.) Though I feel obligated to point out that Michael couldn't just let Archie 'let it out of his system.' He forces Archie's hand, and Archie goes on tv and says why 'everybody should have guns.' And then Archie gets robbed. (Thus hurt with his own ideas.)The 2nd main focus point is ""Everybody Tells the Truth."" This is an interesting episdoe in that we see that while Michael and Gloria see Archie as vicious, ARCHIE SEES MICHAEL AND GLORIA AS VICIOUS.The 3rd crucial point I feel I should mention is ""Archie Is Branded."" We all know that at this point, Archie does not much like Jews. But in this episode, he actually makes friends with a Jewish man who shares his 'fight back views.' And as it turns out, this Jewish man is killed, and Archie is very saddened. (Note: this episode would not have been so poignant if Archie was a liberal. The very fact that Archie was anti Jewish was what made it so poignant when Archie felt horrible at this man's death.)Overall, this is an interesting chapter in Archie's journey from bigotry to acceptance.",3,3 Important Points,1303344000,"04 21, 2011",2011,1669,"[""'m"", 'not', 'biggest', 'fan', 'series', 'other', 'reviewers', 'might', 'offer', 'better', 'insight', 'said', 'think', 'miss', 'crucial', 'point', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'while', 'Archie', 'bigot', 'journey', 'will', 'eventually', 'lead', 'acceptance', 'even', 'love', 'groups', 'bigoted', 'Remember', 'are', '9', 'seasons', 'AITF', 'then', '4', 'seasons', 'Archie', 'Place', '3rd', 'season', 'what', 'consider', '3', 'main', 'focus', 'episodes', '1st', 'Archie', 'Editorial', 'somewhat', 'Archie', 'character', 'very', 'anti', 'gun', 'control', 'reasoning', 'lacks', 'virtually', 'rational', 'thought', 'funny', 'feel', 'obligated', 'point', 'out', 'Michael', 'could', ""n't"", 'just', 'let', 'Archie', ""'let"", 'system', 'Archie', 'hand', 'Archie', 'tv', 'why', ""'everybody"", 'should', 'have', 'guns', 'then', 'Archie', 'robbed', 'Thus', 'hurt', 'own', 'ideas', '2nd', 'main', 'focus', 'point', 'Everybody', 'Truth', 'interesting', 'episdoe', 'see', 'Michael', 'Gloria', 'see', 'Archie', 'vicious', 'ARCHIE', 'SEES', 'MICHAEL', 'AND', 'GLORIA', 'AS', 'VICIOUS.The', '3rd', 'crucial', 'point', 'feel', 'should', 'mention', 'Archie', 'Is', 'Branded', 'know', 'point', 'Archie', 'not', 'much', 'Jews', 'episode', 'actually', 'friends', 'Jewish', 'man', 'who', 'shares', ""'fight"", 'back', 'views', 'out', 'Jewish', 'man', 'killed', 'Archie', 'very', 'saddened', 'Note', 'episode', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'poignant', 'Archie', 'was', 'liberal', 'very', 'fact', 'Archie', 'was', 'anti', 'Jewish', 'was', 'what', 'made', 'so', 'poignant', 'when', 'Archie', 'felt', 'horrible', 'man', 'death', 'Overall', 'interesting', 'chapter', 'Archie', 'journey', 'bigotry', 'acceptance']",N/A

My favorite episode is in Season 3, 'Everybody Tells the Truth.'Michael and Archie have different versions of what happened when the refrigerator goes on the blink. As we see what happens in flashbacks the versions they tell are undeniably funny. No one could have played Archie like Carrol O'Conner, and the same goes for the rest of the cast.

Sherwin,"[4, 4]","Season Three of &#34;All in the Family&#34; has enough laughs and classic humor to make it hilarious and still very special even today, although as others have noted I do wish this three DVD set had come with some extra featurettes or a commentary. The quality of the print is a high average; but that's not much of a bother when the high quality control comedy is all THIS good. The season also won an Emmy and a Golden Globe award for Outstanding Comedy Series; and just one look at these episodes will tell you why! The acting is outstanding and very convincing all the way through and the character development becomes more and more clear as the season progresses in these twenty-four episodes.Although every episode here is a winner, I do have my favorites and I'll list them to give you an idea of just some of the highlights from this season of AITF.Archie&#8217;s Fraud -- It&#8217;s bad enough when Archie is audited by the IRS&#8212;what makes things even worse is that he&#8217;s failed to report income from driving a cab part-time!Gloria and the Riddle &#8211; Gloria (and one of her girlfriends) have a riddle for everyone in the Bunker household to ponder&#8212;why can&#8217;t a doctor operate on a car accident victim because the victim is their own son! Look for even liberal &#8220;Meathead&#8221; Mike to be stumped by this one!Lionel Steps Out &#8211; Things get pretty heated in the Bunker household when Lionel, one of their African-American neighbors, goes out dancing with Archie&#8217;s niece Linda who is, of course, white! Archie is furious; watch what happens when Lionel and Linda react.The Bunkers and The Swingers &#8211; Edith misunderstands the real meaning of a magazine ad when she responds to it, inviting a married couple who are &#8220;swingers&#8221; to the Bunker&#8217;s for what Edith thought would be an innocent night of mere socializing and getting acquainted!Mike&#8217;s Appendix &#8211; Mike (and Archie) wants a male doctor to perform Mike&#8217;s appendectomy even though Mike and Gloria have a great friend and qualified female surgeon friend who will do the operation for much less money&#8212;look for Gloria&#8217;s reaction and it isn&#8217;t pretty!Mike Comes into Money &#8211; When Mike&#8217;s Uncle dies and unexpectedly leaves him money, Mike donates it to the George McGovern presidential campaign. When Mike reminds Archie of their financial arrangement things get heated and very funny fast!Flashback: Mike & Gloria&#8217;s Wedding, Parts 1 & 2 &#8211; Very funny&#8212;probably the best two shows of the season!Archie Goes Too Far &#8211; The latest family feud has both Edith and Gloria storming out of the house to attend a female slumber party&#8212;look for Mike and Archie&#8217;s reactions!Class Reunion &#8211; Archie doesn&#8217;t want to go to Edith&#8217;s thirtieth high school reunion&#8212;until, that is, he discovers that an old flame of Edith&#8217;s, Buck Evans, will also be at that reunion!Everybody Tells the Truth &#8211; Mike and Archie have vastly differing views and memories of a repairman&#8217;s recent visit, with the focus of their disagreement being on a knife! This episode is hilarious!Gloria, the Victim &#8211; Sally Struthers does a superlative job in this episode as she portrays Gloria who has been physically attacked by a would-be rapi$t. We learn it might not be so easy to get the guy convicted.Overall, the third season of &#34;All in the Family&#34; will not disappoint anyone who is a fan of the show or anyone who likes comedy with a message to it.
