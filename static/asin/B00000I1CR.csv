501558,AKHXP8PT63C81,B00000I1CR,"Don Graeter ""dgraeter""","[45, 47]","I was a big fan of Chandler as a boy in the 1950's.  My personal favorites of his from then and as an adult are Pillars of the Sky and Yankee Pasha.  As always with older films, you have to put them in the context of the time in which they were made as far as style, realism, etc.  Believe me, this guy was handsome to the ladies and a man's man to the guys....tons of on screen magnetism.The main thing I want to add about both Chandler and this movie is my experience watching this film as a Navy officer aboard a ship of the very same type during the Viet Nam era.  The title of the film refers to the fact that the ship (the Belinda, as I recall) was an amphibious cargo ship, one which carries marine vehicles, anchors off the coast, lowers boats (""away all boats"") into the water and drops the vehicles into the boats for the trip to the beach with U.S Marines who drive them ashore and onward.  In the officers' wardroom aboard the USS El Paso in the early '70's, we watched this movie multiple times and loved it as well done and realistic.We did get some big chuckles out of the casting comparing actors like Richard Boone (""Have Gun Will Travel"") playing, I think, the First Lieutenant, and Lex Barker (Tarzan) as the Executive Officer and comparing these guys to our own counterparts.  We all thought the film was ""Navy"" all the way, however.  I'm not sure if these amphibious cargo ships are still in operation, but they were used through the first Gulf War.This movie is realistic and an accurate depiction of a U.S.Navy amphibious ship during wartime.  Chandler is certainly the main man in the story but does not dominate to quite the same extent as in some of his other films.  He is good in the role, however, and this is an authentic depiction of Navy life and a good story.",4,High Marks from a Navy Vet!,1092960000,"08 20, 2004",2004,1792,"['was', 'big', 'fan', 'Chandler', 'boy', '1950', 'personal', 'favorites', 'then', 'adult', 'are', 'Pillars', 'Sky', 'Yankee', 'Pasha', 'always', 'older', 'films', 'have', 'put', 'context', 'time', 'were', 'made', 'as', 'far', 'style', 'realism', 'etc', 'Believe', 'guy', 'was', 'handsome', 'ladies', 'man', 'man', 'guys', '.tons', 'screen', 'magnetism.The', 'main', 'thing', 'want', 'add', 'Chandler', 'movie', 'experience', 'watching', 'film', 'Navy', 'officer', 'ship', 'very', 'same', 'type', 'Viet', 'Nam', 'era', 'title', 'film', 'refers', 'fact', 'ship', 'Belinda', 'recall', 'was', 'amphibious', 'cargo', 'ship', 'one', 'marine', 'vehicles', 'anchors', 'coast', 'lowers', 'boats', 'away', 'boats', 'water', 'vehicles', 'boats', 'trip', 'beach', 'U.S', 'Marines', 'who', 'drive', 'ashore', 'onward', 'officers', 'wardroom', 'USS', 'El', 'Paso', 'early', ""'70"", 'watched', 'movie', 'multiple', 'times', 'loved', 'as', 'well', 'done', 'realistic.We', 'did', 'get', 'big', 'chuckles', 'casting', 'comparing', 'actors', 'Richard', 'Boone', 'Have', 'Gun', 'Will', 'Travel', 'playing', 'think', 'First', 'Lieutenant', 'Lex', 'Barker', 'Tarzan', 'Executive', 'Officer', 'comparing', 'guys', 'own', 'counterparts', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'Navy', 'way', 'however', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'amphibious', 'cargo', 'ships', 'are', 'still', 'operation', 'were', 'used', 'first', 'Gulf', 'War.This', 'movie', 'realistic', 'accurate', 'depiction', 'U.S.Navy', 'amphibious', 'ship', 'wartime', 'Chandler', 'certainly', 'main', 'man', 'story', 'not', 'dominate', 'quite', 'same', 'extent', 'other', 'films', 'good', 'role', 'however', 'authentic', 'depiction', 'Navy', 'life', 'good', 'story']",N/A

501560,A36H16ZJXUIMZG,B00000I1CR,"Gene Cisco ""Moon Man""","[1, 1]","Why it has taken so long to see this exciting war yarn, I cannot explain. My guess, though would be that the public would confuse it with &#34;The Caine Mutiny,&#34; which is its opposite, a courtroom drama that originates at sea with all the fireworks on shore. And while that film involves the collapse of command at sea, &#34;Away All Boats&#34; upholds the highest standards of command in peacetime or war, keeping all the action at sea. When Capt. Jebediah Hawks takes command of the USS Belinda, a troop transport, he spends most of his concentration on building competence within his crew while his subordinates maneuver for position for just enough time to rise to Navy standards and Navy know-how under combat conditions. I worried whether I would find the combat scenes as vivid as they were to a 9yr. old at Pax River in 1956. They exceeded those expectations entirely. I was thrilled by the filmed sequences that seemed to place this wounded vessel in action of the Battle of Santa Cruz or Leyte Gulf, the skies were so peppered with flak and zeros. What a supporting cast of future TV stars: William Reynolds, Lex Barker, Charles McGraw, Richard Boone, George Nader and briefly, Clint Eastwood. They all did their uniform and their captain proud by their actions. I was amazed the way the director captured the Belinda, at times, among a flotilla of vessels sharply and colorfully. This is a wonderful Navy proud film with high production standards throughout. Sloppy uniforms and other demerits were noted to get the Belinda and her crew ready for combat.

501567,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B00000I1CR,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[1, 1]","I liked this old war film showing the life (and death) of men serving on board of a not very glamorous but important ship - an attack transport. Below, more of my impressions, with limited SPOILERS.This film is partly based on the novel ""Away all boats"" written in 1953 by Kenneth Dodson, a sailor who served during Pacific War on board of USS ""Pierce"", one of three attack transports of Ormsby class. Commissioned in 1943, and with displacement of 13 thousand tons fully charged, she was a modern and large ship. She was also quite powerfully armed, carrying two 5-inch guns, two 40 mm Bofors anti-aircraft guns and twenty 20 mm Oerlikon automatic anti-aircraft guns. But her real importance resided in the capacity to carry 1550 fully armed marines or soldiers, as well as small landing crafts necessary to carry them to the targeted beaches. USS ""Pierce"" had a very busy war, as she participated in invasions of following islands: Makin (November 1943), Kwajalein (January-February 1944), Saipan (May-June 1944), Angaur (September 1944), Leyte (October-November 1944), Luzon (January 1945), Okinawa (April 1945).The book was a success and Hollywood took interest. This film was turned in 1956 and performed honorably on the box office. Some changes were however made in the scenario, one of which was to rename the ship USS ""Belinda"".As in many films about war at sea, here everything begins with the arrival of a new commanding officer, Captain Jebediah S. Hawks, played magistrally by Jeff Chandler, made famous six years earlier earlier by his portrayal of Cochise in ""Broken Arrow"". The career of this excellent actor was tragically interrupted on 17 June 1961, at age of 43, when during a relatively benign chirurgical intervention to fix a slipped disc the operating doctor cut an artery and caused an uncontrollable hemorrhaging... In this film Jeff Chandler gives a GREAT performance as a very tough, even mean commander, who nevertheless ends by being - reluctantly - respected by his men. Part of his toughness comes from personal disappointment, as he hoped for the command of a cruiser and received instead the definitely less prestigious and glamorous attack transport - but with time he mellows a little (not much, but still), because he finally develops an attachment to ""Belinda""...This is a very masculine movie and there is a real gallery of interesting male characters on board of USS ""Belinda"". Richard Boone and George Nader, both specialists of second roles in numerous war movies and westerns, play two subaltern officers. Lex Barker, who earlier played many times Tarzan and was later to become famous in Europe as Old Shatterhand, plays here Commander Quigley, the less than stellar executive officer. This was also one of the first films, in which appeared Clint Eastwood - but as he was in this time in the very beginning of his career, you will have to pay attention to not miss him, and the one line of his character was actually dubbed by another actor...)))The scenario is fairly good, dialogs are pretty interesting, tensions and drama on board of ""Belinda"" are not half bad shown and there are also some moments of great humor (many of which include the sailor specially affected for throwing away the garbage). Action scenes are not so many, but when towards the end of the film the kamikazes make their appearance, their attack is a pretty intense moment...So bottom line, this is a very honest, solid old war movie, with good actors, a rather good scenario and also with some unexpected twists and surprises. I think I will keep my DVD for another viewing one day.

As an ex navy officer it is startlingly realistic, particularly with regard to the ex merchant marine skipper (George Nader) and the way he was relegated to 2nd lieutenant in the navy, despite having more comprehensive ability than anyone else onboard.(I am ex merchant marine myself!)The very, very great shame of this presentation is that it was shot in VistaVision and stereophonic sound. It would have looked SPECTACULAR on a big screen in it's original format.What we get with this dvd is a very ordinary 4x3 (cropped) picture and monophonic sound!This movie deserves the full blu-ray treatment, in it's original format.One of the great war movies.",4,vistaVision classic,1284422400,"09 14, 2010",2010,678,"['movie', 'stunner', 'ex', 'navy', 'officer', 'startlingly', 'realistic', 'particularly', 'regard', 'ex', 'merchant', 'marine', 'skipper', 'George', 'Nader', 'way', 'was', 'relegated', '2nd', 'lieutenant', 'navy', 'having', 'more', 'comprehensive', 'ability', 'anyone', 'else', 'onboard', 'am', 'ex', 'merchant', 'marine', 'very', 'very', 'great', 'shame', 'presentation', 'was', 'shot', 'VistaVision', 'stereophonic', 'sound', 'would', 'have', 'looked', 'SPECTACULAR', 'big', 'screen', 'original', 'get', 'dvd', 'very', 'ordinary', '4x3', 'cropped', 'picture', 'monophonic', 'sound', 'movie', 'full', 'blu-ray', 'treatment', 'original', 'format.One', 'great', 'war', 'movies']",N/A

I first saw it way back in 1956 or 1957. Those were the last 2 years I spent any time in my home town. After we started our family, I kept our ""home fires burning"" in whichever port his ship was stationed.  I remember one of those was the year I saw the movie, because I was visiting my home town while my husband was ""Away"" on his boat(ship).  At the time, it gave me lots of fear and concern about my husband, because it was so realistic. I saw it with my best girlfriend I grew up with.  I loved it except for it causing me to worry.  I sat and cried all the way through the movie, but I loved it because I loved Jeff Chandler, and of course I related him with my husband. My girlfriend kept telling me ""It's just a movie it's not going to happen to Sam.""  I have seen it on TV several times when one could still catch a good old movie on AMC and TCM. I was thinking the ship was a minesweeper, however, I'm probably wrong since it has been so long since I've seen it. My husband was on a minesweeper when I saw it and those ships are nicknamed ""big splinters"" because if they were to take a bomb or hit one of the mines, there'd be nothing left but splinters due to the fact they were made mostly of wood in order to sweep mines out of the way to make a safe path for bigger fighting ships.  They couldn't be made of any material that would set off a mine or bomb on themselves. So there is something in that movie that I'm not remembering for it to have put that fear into me.  I'll find out when I get the movie and watch again.I thought it was a great movie.  And yes, Jeff Chandler was great in everything.  If he just hadn't passed away at such an early age (34 if my memory serves me)how many more great movies he could have made.And oh yes, my husband served on 3 different minesweepers in addition to 5 other typesSo now, in addition to purchasing nearly all of Amazon's CDs, here I am starting on movies.
