1017907,A26MVLLMLG3Q8B,B000I0RNSY,"Avid Reader ""Karen""","[10, 11]","This DVD is an enjoyable lower body and core workout. It is not just the same old boring lunges and squats - he does different exercises to keep you interested and it is effective. Although I would rate this as an intermediate workout, it is low impact so it can be utilized by those people like myself who have problems with impact due to foot surgery; however at the same time it is an intense workout.Workouts: The main workout is more than 30 minutes of lower body and some core work without weights. Most people (including me) would think a resistance training routine without weights would not be effective, but this DVD will prove this theory wrong. Gilad's warm ups are always long - 10 minutes in this case, but don't miss this warm up because he does some good toning work.Setting: The DVD is set on a beautiful beach in Hawaii.Music: Typical of Gilad's shows, the music is not exciting but not distracting or annoying.Crew: There are 4 people(2 men and 2 women) working out with Gilad who are always demonstrating perfect form.Equipment Needed: None! This would be a great workout to take with you when you travel since it doesn't require any equipment at all. You can always use weights or bands to mix this up.Instructor: I enjoy working out with Gilad on Fit TV and this DVD is no exception. His cueing and explanation of proper form is excellent as always.",5,Effective Lower Body Workout Without Weights,1264118400,"01 22, 2010",2010,1371,"['DVD', 'enjoyable', 'lower', 'body', 'core', 'workout', 'not', 'just', 'same', 'old', 'boring', 'lunges', 'squats', 'different', 'exercises', 'keep', 'interested', 'effective', 'would', 'rate', 'intermediate', 'workout', 'low', 'impact', 'can', 'be', 'utilized', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'problems', 'impact', 'due', 'foot', 'surgery', 'however', 'same', 'time', 'intense', 'workout.Workouts', 'main', 'workout', 'more', '30', 'minutes', 'lower', 'body', 'core', 'work', 'weights', 'Most', 'people', 'including', 'would', 'think', 'resistance', 'training', 'routine', 'weights', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'effective', 'DVD', 'will', 'prove', 'theory', 'wrong', 'Gilad', 'warm', 'ups', 'are', 'always', 'long', '10', 'minutes', 'case', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'warm', 'up', 'good', 'toning', 'work.Setting', 'DVD', 'set', 'beautiful', 'beach', 'Hawaii.Music', 'Typical', 'Gilad', 'shows', 'music', 'not', 'exciting', 'not', 'distracting', 'annoying.Crew', 'are', '4', 'people', '2', 'men', '2', 'women', 'working', 'out', 'Gilad', 'who', 'are', 'always', 'demonstrating', 'perfect', 'form.Equipment', 'Needed', 'None', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'workout', 'take', 'when', 'travel', ""n't"", 'require', 'equipment', 'can', 'always', 'use', 'weights', 'bands', 'mix', 'up.Instructor', 'enjoy', 'working', 'out', 'Gilad', 'Fit', 'TV', 'DVD', 'exception', 'cueing', 'explanation', 'proper', 'form', 'excellent', 'always']",Gilad's Ultimate Body Sculpt Series - Power and Grace
