1319155,A1DRKVXO300RUE,B0032O66FY,Amazon Customer,"[4, 4]","Reading the movie description, I expected a typical horror flick.  Instead, this movie combines a horror film with an interview-like story. The movie basically tells the story by periodically inserting interview footage, and then following that footage with flashbacks of what is described in the interviews.  I generally find that this makes for a somewhat discontinuous movie experience (ala Exorcism of Emily Rose). Despite the discontinuity, the horror elements were very good.  Without giving too much away, the movie is primarily focused on sharing a family's experience with a ghost, and whether or not that ghost manifests itself in photos and video footage. The way the movie reveals the photo/video footage is quite good and was very eerie, but is definitely focused on mood and slowly building psychological impact than startling horror elements that jump out and scare you.  Again, though, the eerie mood was very well developed and maintained throughout the movie.  Very highly recommended, but do frame your expectations accordingly to properly enjoy.",3,"Different than expected, but a good watch",1275004800,"05 28, 2010",2010,1065,"['Reading', 'movie', 'description', 'expected', 'typical', 'horror', 'flick', 'Instead', 'movie', 'horror', 'film', 'interview-like', 'story', 'movie', 'basically', 'story', 'periodically', 'inserting', 'interview', 'footage', 'then', 'following', 'footage', 'flashbacks', 'what', 'described', 'interviews', 'generally', 'find', 'somewhat', 'discontinuous', 'movie', 'experience', 'ala', 'Exorcism', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'discontinuity', 'horror', 'elements', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'movie', 'primarily', 'focused', 'sharing', 'family', 'experience', 'ghost', 'not', 'ghost', 'manifests', 'photos', 'video', 'footage', 'way', 'movie', 'photo/video', 'footage', 'quite', 'good', 'was', 'very', 'eerie', 'definitely', 'focused', 'mood', 'slowly', 'building', 'psychological', 'impact', 'startling', 'horror', 'elements', 'jump', 'out', 'scare', 'Again', 'eerie', 'mood', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'developed', 'maintained', 'movie', 'Very', 'highly', 'recommended', 'do', 'frame', 'expectations', 'accordingly', 'properly', 'enjoy']",N/A
1319156,A2582KMXLK2P06,B0032O66FY,B. E Jackson,"[0, 1]","Wow, I've read descriptions that were totally wrong for movies before but the one I read for Lake Mungo HAS to take the cake!  It said NOTHING about this actually being a documentary or a &#34;mockumentary&#34; as they say.  It's not an actual movie- it's more like a documentary of an Australian family that, due to the lack of information in the description, could very well lead a viewer into thinking this is based on actual evidence.  Maybe that's what the film writers were going for, but it doesn't change the fact that the description failed to mention this is an attempt at a documentary.  So in full documentary/interview style, the storyline is about a series of unexplainable/paranormal events that occur around the house of a family after the tragic drowning of their daughter.For a while I actually thought this was all based on a real occurrence that really did happen until we see the footage captured by the family of the daughter as a ghost standing in random places around their property.  This is when we realize basing a storyline around a documentary was a bad idea.  Why?  Because the images we see of the daughter appearing in a supposed ghostly form are TOO obvious!  She's TOO clear!  The film writers messed up a crucial part of horror storytelling- they made it too obvious that what we're seeing isn't real evidence.  That's why documentaries in the horror genre never work and should never be attempted.In order to present a realistic ghost story, it's important that any footage of the ghosts be presented as not clear.  If the images are too clear, nobody's gonna believe we're actually seeing a ghost.  Simple as that.  What we see in the movie are images of a perfectly clear girl.  Too much detail- even her facial expressions are pronounced.  It makes it too obvious that not only is this not based on a real story (because let's be honest, if this really was actual footage of a girl who came back after drowning, the clarity of the image would change the lives of everyone who sees it and make us -perhaps even millions- all believers of the afterlife).  It's kind of ironic in that many of us *want* answers to those mysterious life after death questions and we want clarity however for the purpose of telling a scary story, the film just doesn't work for me.However the biggest problem is that 45 minutes into the documentary movie, a revelation occurs that completely ruins the movie courtesy of the older brother.  I won't spill the beans, but it lives up to the &#34;mockumentary&#34; tagline.  I guess the film writers wanted to bury themselves even deeper.  The film should have ended RIGHT NOW!  Well I mean, after the parents punish the brother for mocking his own sisters death (which never happened curiously enough- why would the parents let the boy off the hook so easily?)  Seriously, imagine losing your brother and sister and mocking their death.  Wouldn't that make you feel like the worst person in the world?  And to not even punish the boy but to push the whole incident under the rug like it was nothing... unforgiveable.  Then again the parents never really reacted to the ghostly images of the daughter with as much shock as you'd expect either.Anyway now the movie becomes a mystery as the family searches out to figure out what happened before their daughter drowned and if any clues are able to lead them into figuring out what occurred before she died (including secret spots where she was hiding items, and even a silly plot involving a sexual encounter with the neighbor).  I'm guessing the writers thought that the scariness pertaining to the images of a girl appearing in the first half of the movie wasn't interesting enough (especially after they ruined it halfway through thanks to the older brother, lol) so they tried to make the writing better by completely changing it to a clue-searching mystery in the second half.  Didn't work for me.  All it did was make a failed mockery of a horror turn into a lousy, uninteresting mystery.Also why in the WORLD is this movie called a sci fi?  That's what it said in the description.  It's bad enough it's not horror, but it's *certainly* not a science fiction film either.  I just didn't like this movie much at all.  Making it a documentary was the worst decision the writers could have made, but insulting us with unrealistic ghostly footage only for the brother to... sorry, don't want to spoil that part, and for the movie to shift into a mystery/crime afterwards is just a mishmash of really terrible ideas.

1319159,A3ITYWFTPW71H2,B0032O66FY,Brett Talley,"[0, 0]","For a very long time, I have been on a quest to find a trulyfrightening, truly unsettling, scary movie. It's not an easy quest. Thelast one to achieve that lofty bar was The Ring, a movie that requireda high degree of suspension of disbelief, but was pretty horrifying ifyou were able to accomplish it. I have seen many unsettling movies inthe past few years--Irreversible, Inside, Audition to name a few--butthese movies, while disturbing, aren't all that frightening.When I started Lake Mungo, I wasn't expecting to find anything that wasable to quench my thirst for horror, and maybe that's why I ended upenjoying it so much. A movie that was part of the failed and, on mypart at least, much missed, After Dark Horrorfest, Lake Mungo was apleasant surprise, one that stuck with me well after the camerasstopped rolling.Lake Mungo is a mockumentary, kin to, but not the same as, the recentspate of ""found footage"" films that have graced the big screen for thelast decade. It incorporates many of that sub-genre's strengths, whilelacking its fundamental weakness--would anyone really be filming in thissituation? I give you the movie synopsis:Sixteen-year-old Alice Palmer drowns while swimming in the local dam.When her body is recovered and a verdict of accidental death returned,her grieving family buries her. The family then experiences a series ofstrange and inexplicable events centered in and around their home.Profoundly unsettled, the Palmers seek the help of psychic andparapsychologist, Ray Kemeny. But as their investigation continues,they soon discover they didn't really know their daughter at all. LakeMungo starts off slow. Real slow. The first fifteen minutes or so werenot easy to get through, but I'll forgive the filmmakers because therelationship they establish with the viewer in those beginning scenesprobably does a lot to accentuate the level of tension and the level ofparticipation by the audience.The acting in Lake Mungo is of a quality one doesn't often see in ahorror movie. The actors are required to portray ordinary people goingthrough the extraordinary pain of losing a child. And let me tell you,they pull it off. It is nearly impossible to watch Lake Mungo and notbelieve you are watching a real documentary. And that's what makes themovie so creepy. There are no jump shots in this movie. There's verylittle gore. There's nothing about Lake Mungo that is particularlyscary. But the totality of the experience is decidedly unsettling. Bythe end of the movie, my hair was standing on end and I was beginningto look over my shoulder, that feeling that I was not alone starting tocreep in.I think the brilliance of Lake Mungo lies in its mid-movie twist. Upuntil that point, Lake Mungo seems like a pretty standard paranormalhaunting film. But then everything changes, and everything gets muchweirder, much more interesting, and much more scary. And that's thepoint, isn't it?I would definitely recommend Lake Mungo to horror fans, particularlythose who enjoy paranormal frights. It's not a perfect movie, and I amsure some people will find it to be boring in the extreme. But if youlet it take hold, I can promise you it won't let go.Brett J.

1319161,A1XQJHELRQ2A4F,B0032O66FY,Cary Watson,"[3, 4]","The Australian film Lake Mungo is a faux documentary; let's get that out of the way right off the top. I make a point of mentioning this because if you see this film you will, at several points, have to remind yourself that it is not actually a doc. The director, Joel Anderson, has done an amazing job of creating a film that looks and feels as though it was created by a world-class documentary maker. This is not one of those Blair Witch-type films filmed entirely with shaky-cam shots and grainy video footage. There is some of that in Lake Mungo, but its restrained use makes these scenes all the more effective.The film is about the Palmer family, who come to believe that they're being haunted by their 16 year-old daughter, Alice, after she drowns in a lake. The family seeks the aid of a psychic and uses video cameras to help determine if they are, in fact, being haunted.That quick summary makes Lake Mungo sound like just another Paranormal Activity clone, the kind of film in which we wait for the next moment when something jumps out at us and the screaming ensues. Lake Mungo is quite definitely about the supernatural, and there is a ghost, but it is much more than a scarefest. It's one the finest dramas I've seen in quite a few years.You could say that this film is primarily a study of grief; an incisive, sympathetic, nuts and bolts look at how a family copes with a tragic loss. In fact, the more times you view this film, the more you concentrate on the family drama side of the story and less on the supernatural. Lake Mungo is also about family secrets, about the way otherwise normal, happy families can keep things from one another. One of the biggest shocks in the movie is not caused by a spectral figure, but by a revelation about Alice.A great deal of the strength of this film comes from its cast, who improvised their dialogue based on plot points they had to hit. If this is what improvisation can achieve, why bother with scriptwriters? Another aspect that merits praise is the look of the film. Anderson and his cinematographer have a knack for choosing just the right angles and lighting tones for their interior shots. Even better is their sensational use of time lapse photography, striking night skies, and electronic sound effects to make the Palmer's house and the surrounding town seem that much eerier.Is Lake Mungo scary? It's definitely creepy, unsettling, chilling, and there's certainly one jump-in-your-seat moment. Comments about it I've read online, mostly from diehard horror fans, express annoyance that it isn't scary enough. My daughter (a generally sensible third-year law student) found it so frightening she watched (heard) most of the film from behind a pillow, and then spent the next five nights sleeping with the lights on. I think it works brilliantly as both a ghost story and a drama. After seeing it for the first time I left the film feeling terribly sad rather than frightened. I felt as though I'd shared the Palmer's loss, rather than suffered through a haunting.Lake Mungo is supposed to remade by an American studio (now that's scary), so order it from Amazon before it turns up in your local cinema starring Lady GaGa and David Hasselhoff.You can read more of my reviews at JettisonCocoon dot com.",5,"A great ghost story, an even better drama",1310342400,"07 11, 2011",2011,3270,"['Australian', 'film', 'Lake', 'Mungo', 'faux', 'documentary', 'let', 'get', 'way', 'right', 'off', 'top', 'make', 'point', 'mentioning', 'see', 'film', 'will', 'several', 'points', 'have', 'remind', 'not', 'actually', 'doc', 'director', 'Joel', 'Anderson', 'done', 'amazing', 'job', 'creating', 'film', 'feels', 'was', 'created', 'world-class', 'documentary', 'maker', 'not', 'one', 'Blair', 'Witch-type', 'films', 'filmed', 'entirely', 'shaky-cam', 'shots', 'grainy', 'video', 'footage', 'Lake', 'Mungo', 'restrained', 'use', 'scenes', 'more', 'effective.The', 'film', 'Palmer', 'family', 'who', 'come', 'believe', ""'re"", 'being', 'haunted', '16', 'year-old', 'daughter', 'Alice', 'lake', 'family', 'aid', 'psychic', 'video', 'cameras', 'help', 'determine', 'are', 'fact', 'being', 'haunted.That', 'quick', 'summary', 'Lake', 'Mungo', 'sound', 'just', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'clone', 'kind', 'film', 'wait', 'next', 'moment', 'when', 'something', 'out', 'screaming', 'ensues', 'Lake', 'Mungo', 'quite', 'definitely', 'supernatural', 'ghost', 'much', 'more', 'scarefest', 'one', 'finest', 'dramas', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'quite', 'few', 'years.You', 'could', 'say', 'film', 'primarily', 'study', 'grief', 'incisive', 'sympathetic', 'nuts', 'bolts', 'look', 'how', 'family', 'tragic', 'loss', 'fact', 'more', 'times', 'view', 'film', 'more', 'concentrate', 'family', 'side', 'story', 'less', 'supernatural', 'Lake', 'Mungo', 'also', 'family', 'secrets', 'way', 'otherwise', 'normal', 'happy', 'families', 'can', 'keep', 'things', 'one', 'One', 'biggest', 'shocks', 'movie', 'not', 'caused', 'spectral', 'figure', 'revelation', 'Alice.A', 'great', 'deal', 'strength', 'film', 'cast', 'who', 'improvised', 'dialogue', 'based', 'plot', 'points', 'had', 'hit', 'what', 'improvisation', 'can', 'achieve', 'why', 'bother', 'scriptwriters', 'aspect', 'merits', 'praise', 'look', 'film', 'Anderson', 'cinematographer', 'have', 'knack', 'choosing', 'just', 'right', 'angles', 'lighting', 'tones', 'interior', 'shots', 'Even', 'better', 'sensational', 'use', 'time', 'lapse', 'photography', 'striking', 'night', 'skies', 'electronic', 'sound', 'effects', 'make', 'Palmer', 'house', 'surrounding', 'town', 'seem', 'much', 'eerier.Is', 'Lake', 'Mungo', 'scary', 'definitely', 'creepy', 'unsettling', 'chilling', 'certainly', 'one', 'jump-in-your-seat', 'moment', 'Comments', ""'ve"", 'read', 'online', 'mostly', 'diehard', 'horror', 'fans', 'express', 'annoyance', ""n't"", 'scary', 'enough', 'daughter', 'generally', 'sensible', 'third-year', 'law', 'student', 'found', 'so', 'frightening', 'watched', 'heard', 'most', 'film', 'pillow', 'then', 'spent', 'next', 'five', 'nights', 'sleeping', 'lights', 'think', 'brilliantly', 'ghost', 'story', 'drama', 'seeing', 'first', 'time', 'left', 'film', 'feeling', 'terribly', 'rather', 'frightened', 'felt', ""'d"", 'shared', 'Palmer', 'loss', 'rather', 'suffered', 'haunting.Lake', 'Mungo', 'supposed', 'remade', 'American', 'studio', 'now', 'scary', 'so', 'order', 'Amazon', 'up', 'local', 'cinema', 'starring', 'Lady', 'GaGa', 'David', 'Hasselhoff.You', 'can', 'read', 'more', 'reviews', 'JettisonCocoon', 'dot', 'com']",N/A

1319164,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B0032O66FY,Chris Pandolfi,"[46, 49]","""Lake Mungo"" is an unsettling and unreasonably absorbing movie, one that ingenuously merges the structure of a documentary, the mystery of a detective story, the character development of a drama, and the suspense of a horror movie. It's genuinely good, but because it lacks gore, violence, nudity, and action, I suspect it will not be met with universal praise within the horror community. Like last fall's surprisingly effective ""The House of the Devil,"" this is a film that should be commended simply for having audiences in mind other than teenagers with short attention spans. Rather than assault you with slasher tactics, writer/director Joel Anderson has the temerity to have the characters talk directly to the camera; if we do find ourselves frightened, it's not because something has jumped out at us but because we see the terror, grief, and confusion on everyone's face.That's the greatest achievement of this film: It takes conventional ideas - poltergeist activity, buried secrets, premonitions, strange deaths - and humanizes them. Not even the brilliant ""Paranormal Activity"" could put a face on either of its leads; all effort was put into building a sequence of events. ""Lake Mungo,"" more polished and varied in its approach, is edited in much the same way as a Discovery or History Channel special, with a group of people giving on-camera interviews for a team of filmmakers documenting a supposed case of suburban haunting. At the center of the investigation is sixteen-year-old Alice Palmer (Talia Zucker), who drowned mysteriously in December of 2005 while picnicking with her family.Not long after her funeral, odd things begin happening at the Palmer residence. Noises are heard on the roof and outside the window. The door to Alice's room keeps slamming on its own, even after it had been taken off its hinges and replaced. The mother, June (Rosie Traynor), begins having nightmares, which become so bad that she takes walks in the middle of the night. At a certain point, she even breaks into other people's homes, not to steal anything, but simply to get some sleep. The father, Russell (David Pledger), goes into Alice's room and has what can best be described as a vision, which ends startlingly. Alice's brother, Matthew (Martin Sharpe), goes to the doctor with unexplained bruises on his body, which disappear just as quickly as they show up. And then there are his photographs and videos, which both seem to reveal the presence of Alice's ghost.Before long, June turns to Ray Kemeny (Steve Jordel), a radio host and psychic who specializes in paranormal activity. June likes him. Indeed, there's nothing especially eccentric about him, although he does have a large collection of cassette tapes. During their first session together, June is put into a hypnotic state and asked to describe what she sees. What we hear is undeniably chilling, but it doesn't really resonate until later on.Now, what are we to make of this? Is all as it seems? As is the case with a lot of actual investigations, not everything comes to light at the very start. Consider Alice. At her funeral, news reports quote her family and friends, who said she was a ""happy, fun-loving girl with a zest for life,"" a ""great person,"" and ""very popular, clever, and lovely."" All very nice, but does it actually reveal anything? People are not one-dimensional - to a greater or lesser degree, we all lead a double life, and of that, I will say no more. Consider Matthew. Do his photos tell the whole story? Maybe they say more about him than they do about Alice. Consider Ray. Let's just say that, regardless of whether or not they have genuine abilities, psychics always seem to know more than they initially care to admit.A trail of evidence leads the Palmers to Lake Mungo, a dried-up Australian lakebed Alice had visited during a class trip. What they discover is terrifying, although I'm hard pressed to say that they get the answers they were looking for. We don't, either. We only have the speculations of a grieving family sitting in front of a camera.Not bloody enough for you? Too much talk and not enough action? This movie will certainly not do anything for the masked-killer-and-gory-deaths crowd, who will no doubt see it as slow, uneventful, and boring. But for others, it will be regarded highly, seen as a quietly unnerving psychological drama that is legitimately frightening. I may be in the minority here, but I'm confident in my assertion that ""Lake Mungo"" is a horror movie, made with the intention of actually horrifying the audience. I attribute most of its success to its compelling character development; we're actually made to care about the Palmers and what happens to them, or more accurately, what we think happens to them.

A young girl drowns while swimming near a dam. Shortly thereafter weird stuff starts happening to her family. Via motion activated cameras and work with a psychic a story begins to unfold. The story reveals the daughter's double life but also a reason for the apparitions.This is a great idea and it's carried off, for the most part, very well. I'm sitting and watching this and I'm thinking ""is this a documentary?"" I didn't think so but I had to grab the box art to be certain. This is so spot on in it's execution that an unwary observer would not consider for an instant that what they are viewing were not real people reviewing real events. The style, the camera work, the actors all make this appear just as the producers/director wanted it. Hats off to the writer on that one. The dialogue is great. He has these actors sounding like real people in the way the talk.

Then their daughter's image begins showing up in photographs taken around Lake Mungo and in photos taken around their home.  The girl's brother begins setting up a video recorder to try and capture further evidence.  All this lead to further startling revelations about the girl.

Lake Mungo is perhaps the most complicated scary slow burning horror story I have seen in all my life. In simple words, not since Paranormal Activity have I seen something so dominating to the hair on my arm and back. Secondly, Lake Numbo is made in the style of a documentary so the characters are relating the story in retrospect and without the use of the usual drama-tisms it scintillates you. At no point will you see something that will make you close the eyes but the absolute dominance the ""Story- telling"" will keep you hooked and bloody scared.This would easily be the finest Australian film I have seen. Who would have thought Horror/Mystery/Suspense could be told in such a retrospective way. Also the acting is so real, the interviews and everything will make you feel hooked.

What a gem I discovered - this is an amazingly good movie.  I might otherwise give it four stars, but chose five to try to correct for some of the one star reviews that might prevent others from checking this movie out.  Pay no mind to those one-star reviewers - their brains have been eaten by zombies.Lake Mungo  centers around the tragic drowning of a 16 year-old girl, and her grieving family's belief that her ghost is present in the house, perhaps needing to communicate something about her death.  The format is faux documentary - but there is never any doubt that it is scripted.  I don't think the director intended us to believe otherwise.  The real-world rough edges are smoothed out to better draw us into his eerie one.  The performances are wonderfully understated, underscoring the surreal mood.  And it may have been filmed on a low budget, but there is million-dollar talent behind that camera. Most impressive were the ""ghost"" scenes - they are shot like a disturbing dream, the kind you have when you are unsure if you are dreaming or awake.  Not to get all highbrow, but I was reminded of Igmar Bergman's Persona. There were scenes in that film that blurred the line between The dream and waking worlds that left me with an uneasy, creepy feeling,  just like Lake Mungo did.I think the preponderance of negative reviews on this site are from those who were expecting cheap thrills.  There are none to be had here, but the patient viewer is left with a more enduring, subtle horror.  There are a few unexpected twists that may leave some viewers rolling their eyeballs, but hang in there.  Not all is as it seems. There's a quote from the doomed girl that still sends chills up my spine:  ""I feel like something bad is going to happen to me.  Like it already has.  It just hasn't reached me yet.

The feeling of authenticity is what makes it is so effective. Zombie attacks, serial killers, jump scares, and vengeful ghosts no longer do it for me. I am not easily startled have been desensitized to all the tricks of the horror movie trade. I have watched many horror movies and very few have been able to tap into the fear center of my brain. Both JUON and The Ring did so a decade ago and there have been a few others along the way I'm sure. I am pleased to report that Lake Mungo is a contender for one of the eeriest, most unsettling films I have ever seen. I find myself still thinking about it and I have been unable to shake the insufferable feelings of dread and sorrow the story induces. It is difficult, almost impossible to convey why the story is so chilling. Everyone ponders their own death from time to time. This film somehow manages to capture our worries about mortality and use them as the driving force behind the story.In Lake Mungo we literally look fear in the face. The story works because it feels genuine due to the convincing documentary structure. More than once I had to remind myself that this was pure fiction and not a real family. I watched this alone in the dark and by time the closing credits rolled I didn't want to leave my chair. The gurgling noises my refrigerator occasionally makes became a ghost in my mind. The furnace kicking off deep in my basement was surely death coming for me. Lake Mungo is the opposite of films like Final Destination. Rather than loud, in-your-face, gory silly stuff, the film gets under your skin in an insidious manner until you realize that you have been holding your breath. I can't underscore how effective this movie is in delivering the chills. Once again Australia is kicking horror butt.

Having read so many reviews, being a fan of the slow burn dramatic ghost story, and believing the mock documentary style can be a powerful tool to paint characters as real human beings, I already knew I&#8217;d enjoy Lake Mungo. And, yes, the actors do an amazing job of making everything feel authentic. Never once do you feel like you&#8217;re watching a fictional film. And, yes, the cinematography is incredible, expertly creating mood from the simplest of images. And for the first half of the film, those elements were enough to sustain its potential greatness. And then&#8230;nothing. Again, I don&#8217;t bore easily, I prefer slow character-building, and I enjoy ambiguity in film. I don&#8217;t like being spoon fed answers.

Half of the &#8216;interviews&#8217; simply repeat what&#8217;s been said, over and again. And many of the interviewees have not even a tangential purpose to the overall film. They seem like filler. And one would think the experience is building up to something, anything &#8211; not some violent clash (it&#8217;s not that kind of ghost story), but&#8230;something. Unfortunately, once we get to Lake Mungo, we experience the least satisfying and least climactic ending I&#8217;ve perhaps ever seen in a &#8216;good film&#8217;. Simply put, nothing happens. I waited for 90 minutes without any tension building, always with the hope and assumption that something emotionally significant would happen, just to find&#8230;the whole point of the film is about moving on. The simplest answer to a horrifying tragedy. Ghosts exist. And when we move on emotionally, we simply don&#8217;t see them anymore. A painful exercise in stating the obvious.Overall, much beauty to the film, and true authenticity. Also, the &#8216;ghost images&#8217; are done quite well and leave a lasting impression. Hence the 3 stars. However, it seems like a film that&#8217;s trying to convince the audience that it&#8217;s something &#8216;more&#8217;, that it has a greater purpose, and it simply doesn&#8217;t.

It is told in a documentary style, similar to shows like Paranormal Witness.Although it sounds like your typical supernatural/ghost story, Lake Mungo's story focuses more on the troubles and devastations the family went through, and their path to closure. It has some very creepy footage and photographs of a ghost presumed to be Alice, though, which adds the horror elements. It balances the drama and horror very well, and it feels like an authentic documentary. The ending was good, I felt it was a bit unfulfilling, though. If you're into ghosts and slow-paced horror films like I am, you may find this film to be enjoyable and even unsettling. I like the path this film took and it really sets it apart. The acting was great, as well.Overall, I enjoyed Lake Mungo and thought it was creepy and effective. I should emphasize that this film has a very slow-pace, and you'll probably dislike it if you're expecting jump scares or anything similar to what most modern horror films use nowadays; fans of movies like The Pact and Absentia may enjoy it though.

It works on a supernatural level, a documentary level, a drama level, a Spiritualism level. It is so complex, it might take several viewings to understand it all. And no matter how many times you view it to see it's secrets, the gloomy creepy atmosphere will always be there.As I stated earlier, it is hard to review a film such as this without ruining it, but I highly recommend this film.  It's not ultra-budget. Don't expect sudden shocks and gore. The best example of how this film is presented would be shows like ""Snapped"", ""Murder By The Book"", etc where the story is told through interviews, pictures, video clips, etc. And the opening with audio interview clips over vintage spirit photographs is wonderful!I have viewed this film twice. I am about to watch it again. Now that I have seen it a second time, there are things said and shown that I did not catch the first time.This has to be one of the most thoughtful films about death, greiving, and the afterlife that has ever been written. I pray that when the film is remade, that the director actually pays attention to it's message. I cannot picture this film presented any other way and I hope the remake is never made.",5,Subtle and haunting,1299542400,"03 8, 2011",2011,2234,"['one', 'films', 'self-proclaimed', 'horror', 'buffs', 'scream', 'FOUL', 'reality', 'just', 'show', 'more', 'horror', 'blood', 'gore', 'Something', ""n't"", 'have', 'have', 'gory', 'make', 'up', 'effects', 'extreme', 'violence', 'be', 'film', 'narrative', 'quietly', 'unfolded', 'films', 'matter', 'what', 'look', 'something', 'always', 'different', 'angle', 'see', 'hard', 'part', 'trying', 'review', 'film', 'twists', 'revealing', 'secrets', 'spoiling', 'will', 'put', 'way', 'Something', 'will', 'be', 'presented', 'then', 're-presenting', 'again', 'new', 'fact', 'will', 'emerge', 'sometimes', 'when', 'presented', 'yet', 'again', 'new', 'fact', 'will', 'emerge', 'Just', 'when', 'think', 'eerie', 'enough', '..it', 'even', 'more', 'atmospheric.This', 'deep', 'film', 'Not', 'only', 'deal', 'grief', 'other', 'human', 'emotions', 'such', 'trust', 'secrecy', 'what', 'great', 'person', 'might', 'go', 'keep', 'something', 'secret.This', 'multi-dimensional', 'film', 'supernatural', 'level', 'documentary', 'level', 'drama', 'level', 'Spiritualism', 'level', 'so', 'complex', 'might', 'take', 'several', 'viewings', 'understand', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'view', 'see', 'secrets', 'gloomy', 'creepy', 'atmosphere', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'there.As', 'stated', 'earlier', 'hard', 'review', 'film', 'such', 'ruining', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'not', 'ultra-budget', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'sudden', 'shocks', 'gore', 'best', 'example', 'how', 'film', 'presented', 'would', 'be', 'shows', 'Snapped', 'Murder', 'Book', 'etc', 'where', 'story', 'told', 'interviews', 'pictures', 'video', 'clips', 'etc', 'opening', 'audio', 'interview', 'clips', 'vintage', 'spirit', 'photographs', 'wonderful', 'have', 'viewed', 'film', 'twice', 'am', 'watch', 'again', 'Now', 'have', 'seen', 'second', 'time', 'are', 'things', 'said', 'shown', 'did', 'not', 'catch', 'first', 'time.This', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'thoughtful', 'films', 'death', 'greiving', 'afterlife', 'ever', 'been', 'written', 'pray', 'when', 'film', 'remade', 'director', 'actually', 'attention', 'message', 'can', 'not', 'picture', 'film', 'presented', 'other', 'way', 'hope', 'remake', 'never', 'made']",N/A

While less of a horror movie, but more than a psychological thriller, it does have enough disturbing images to be chilling and a sense of desparation that is just heartbreaking. The story is simple. A documentary is being filmed about a family that has just lost their teenage daughter in a drowning, and the mysterious cirumstances that arise after her death. There are apparitions, bumps in the night, strange photos, etc. that are explored through interviews with family and friends. The first half of the flick is genuinely eerie, while the second half tries a bit too hard to do too much. Nonetheless, it does an oustanding job of following a grief-stricken family's journey through recovery and acceptance, which is no doubt the most painful subject explored.And it is shot like a documentary, and a well done one at that. There is no narration. If you do not like documentaries, you will NOT like this. The film crew really isn't involved. The family literally tells there own story through words, pictures, and videos.

1319204,A171FU7AC9YYMS,B0032O66FY,"Steve Forsyth ""sforsythnoe""","[1, 7]","The second of Afterdark Horrorfest #4 that I watched this year -LAKE MUNGO follows in the footsteps of other Shockumentaries, such as the recent PARANORMAL ACTIVITY and QUARANTINE (a remake of the Spanish film REC), and dating back to the now classic BLAIR WITCH PROJECT.  The subgenre itself owes much to the Mockumentary genre - films like SPINAL TAP and WAITING FOR GUFFMAN.As such, LAKE MUNGO, which came AFTER all of these other films, cannot help but be judged against them all.  In its favor, it does add a bit of originality in the sense that it is not merely ""images cobbled together"" from some eye-witness camera, but actually has characters interviewed directly by the faux documentarian, telling us the events of the story.  The film feels like an A&E; documentary show.The story it tells is simple enough - Alice, a teenage girl, drowned in a reservoir, and her family came to believe her presence was ""haunting"" their home.  They take photos and set up cameras to try to catch her image, which they succeed in doing.  As the film plays out, we learn the truth of these various images, and also uncover secrets of Alice's past, leading up to her death.  The images are comprised of interviews, still photos, and the aforementioned cameras set up in the home, as well as home movie footage and even some cell phone videos.The concept is fairly intriguing, and the production is top notch.  The actors play their parts well, coming off as very real and sincere.  There is certainly no flaw in the film's execution.The problem is that it's just not that interesting in the end, and certainly not scary to anyone over the age of 10.  The events unfold very slowly, and it isn't until the final 15 minutes that anything truly creepy takes place.  These late in the game creep-outs are really ONLY creepy - they don't really amount to a true scare.  The final moment involving past footage of Alice in a hypnosis session nearly revives interest in the film, but again it doesn't really go anywhere.I was left feeling like I had wasted 80 minutes of my day.  I do appreciate that the film never settled for sudden ""jump scares"" (save for one slight jump moment near the end).  But even as much as I appreciate the subtlety, it does not make for a very compelling film experience.Further hurting the film is the fact that, by relying heavily on blown-up photos, home movie cameras, and cell phones for the a large portion of its footage, the bulk of the film was grainy, dark, blurry, and hard to make out.  Perhaps sensing how hard some of the creep images were to make out, the filmmakers include a soundtrack that would suddenly turn dark whenever a ghost image would appear.  But this just comes off as a gimmick - as if the filmmakers are standing behind you saying, ""ok, be scared now . . . ohhhh, isn't that creepy!?""Bottom Line: for an Afterdark film, its certainly well-polished in presentation and performance - and I appreciate the cerebral approach versus the silly gore or constant loud jump-scares.  But, unfortunately, the events in the story do not ultimately add up to an interesting film.  I give it a three out of five simply for the quality of the work - but I wish it had found a way to tell a better or scarier story.",3,"Well-made and Intriguing - but unfortunately the Shockumentary takes a long, dull path to nowhere.",1269302400,"03 23, 2010",2010,3244,"['second', 'Afterdark', 'Horrorfest', '4', 'watched', 'year', 'MUNGO', 'footsteps', 'other', 'Shockumentaries', 'such', 'recent', 'PARANORMAL', 'ACTIVITY', 'QUARANTINE', 'remake', 'Spanish', 'film', 'REC', 'dating', 'back', 'now', 'classic', 'BLAIR', 'WITCH', 'PROJECT', 'subgenre', 'owes', 'much', 'Mockumentary', 'genre', 'films', 'SPINAL', 'TAP', 'WAITING', 'FOR', 'GUFFMAN.As', 'such', 'LAKE', 'MUNGO', 'came', 'AFTER', 'other', 'films', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'be', 'judged', 'favor', 'add', 'bit', 'originality', 'sense', 'not', 'merely', 'images', 'cobbled', 'together', 'eye-witness', 'camera', 'actually', 'characters', 'interviewed', 'directly', 'faux', 'documentarian', 'telling', 'events', 'story', 'film', 'feels', 'A', 'E', 'documentary', 'show.The', 'story', 'simple', 'enough', 'Alice', 'teenage', 'girl', 'drowned', 'reservoir', 'family', 'came', 'believe', 'presence', 'was', 'haunting', 'home', 'take', 'photos', 'set', 'up', 'cameras', 'try', 'catch', 'image', 'succeed', 'doing', 'film', 'out', 'learn', 'truth', 'various', 'images', 'also', 'uncover', 'secrets', 'Alice', 'past', 'leading', 'up', 'death', 'images', 'are', 'comprised', 'interviews', 'still', 'photos', 'aforementioned', 'cameras', 'set', 'up', 'home', 'as', 'well', 'home', 'movie', 'footage', 'even', 'cell', 'phone', 'videos.The', 'concept', 'fairly', 'intriguing', 'production', 'top', 'notch', 'actors', 'play', 'parts', 'well', 'coming', 'off', 'very', 'real', 'sincere', 'certainly', 'flaw', 'film', 'execution.The', 'problem', 'just', 'not', 'interesting', 'end', 'certainly', 'not', 'scary', 'anyone', 'age', '10', 'events', 'unfold', 'very', 'slowly', ""n't"", 'final', '15', 'minutes', 'anything', 'truly', 'creepy', 'place', 'late', 'game', 'creep-outs', 'are', 'really', 'ONLY', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'amount', 'true', 'scare', 'final', 'moment', 'involving', 'past', 'footage', 'Alice', 'hypnosis', 'session', 'nearly', 'interest', 'film', 'again', ""n't"", 'really', 'go', 'anywhere.I', 'was', 'left', 'feeling', 'had', 'wasted', '80', 'minutes', 'day', 'do', 'appreciate', 'film', 'never', 'settled', 'sudden', 'jump', 'scares', 'save', 'one', 'slight', 'jump', 'moment', 'end', 'even', 'as', 'much', 'appreciate', 'subtlety', 'not', 'make', 'very', 'compelling', 'film', 'experience.Further', 'hurting', 'film', 'fact', 'relying', 'heavily', 'blown-up', 'photos', 'home', 'movie', 'cameras', 'cell', 'phones', 'large', 'portion', 'footage', 'bulk', 'film', 'was', 'grainy', 'dark', 'blurry', 'hard', 'make', 'out', 'Perhaps', 'sensing', 'how', 'hard', 'creep', 'images', 'were', 'make', 'out', 'filmmakers', 'include', 'soundtrack', 'would', 'suddenly', 'turn', 'dark', 'whenever', 'ghost', 'image', 'would', 'appear', 'just', 'off', 'gimmick', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'standing', 'saying', 'ok', 'be', 'scared', 'now', 'ohhhh', ""n't"", 'creepy', 'Bottom', 'Line', 'Afterdark', 'film', 'certainly', 'well-polished', 'presentation', 'performance', 'appreciate', 'cerebral', 'approach', 'silly', 'gore', 'constant', 'loud', 'jump-scares', 'unfortunately', 'events', 'story', 'do', 'not', 'ultimately', 'add', 'up', 'interesting', 'film', 'give', 'three', 'five', 'simply', 'quality', 'work', 'wish', 'had', 'found', 'way', 'tell', 'better', 'scarier', 'story']",N/A
1319205,A3DV7AKNM4N8TN,B0032O66FY,Stuart Conover,"[1, 3]","Written and directed by Joel Anderson this is his second movie made in the horror genre, the first being ""The Rotting Woman"" released in 2002, which I had never heard of until now. After his 2008 release though of Lake Mungo if it's at all similar I'll be honest when I say I have no plans on going to seeing his previous works.I'm going to start out by saying that I am biased against the majority of ghost films out there. It's become too trendy to film them in a documentary style (I understand budget concerns) but when you have film makers creating works such as Paranormal Activity and the lesser known but what should be just as popular ""Evil Things"" there isn't much of an excuse to go the documentary route and not try to make something simply amazing, or at least enjoyable.Honestly if I wasn't folding laundry or sorting mail while watching the film I don't think I would have made it all the way through it. Hell any of the films in the Blair Witch franchise would prove to be a more entertaining watch.We begin the movie with the focal point of the film - Alice, the main character, drowning. As time goes on the daughter's picture starts to show up in the background in an increased amount of photographs and while the father and sister had both seen the body and knew it the daughter was actually dead the mother had not which was supposed to be what pushed her originally on the idea that maybe her daughter was still alive.This is the part of the film that is trying to show the family slowly being haunted in an increased amount by the daughter. Her face showing up in pictures, the family looking increasingly disturbed, and a radio psychic from another country who never really says there is a ghost but is spoken with about the daughter on multiple occasions. I want to stress that this is the part of the film that is trying to show us that the family is being haunted because there never really is a haunting shown in any way, shape, or form past the photographs and eventually - a video.You do learn a 'lot' about what was going on in the daughter's life as the film progresses which could have been a great way to make it a thriller. If it was done a little bit closer to the style of ""The Lovely Bones"" in how the plot was written (woman died, family finds out she was killed, and eventually who killers her) instead of a stab at a paranormal story it could have had more of a chance of working in my eyes. It even came close to it at points but with how it was clearly pushing the paranormal focus of the film over everything else. I'd love to blame this on being sick of paranormal movies but there were 2 I watched in the past year that really were entertaining and this one couldn't deliver the goods.

Actually, the film by the writer / director Joel Anderson (feature debut) is trying to be something different - something unique like a psychological drama about a grief-stricken family told with a David Lynch touch.A 16-year-old girl Alice Palmer (Talia Zucker) is gone missing while swimming in a local dam, and later is found dead. There is nothing suspicious about her death, but after the burial the remaining family members start to experience strange things. Shocked and unsettled, the family turns to a local radio psychic Ray Kemeny (Steve Jodrell), only to discover something disturbing.""Lake Mungo"" begins as a typical ghost story, but later takes an unexpected direction more than once. Not to spoil the film for those who haven't seen it, I will only tell you that the film is less about what happens to those who are being interviewed, than about Alice Palmer herself when she was alive. Those who remember a certain popular TV series in the early 1990s may remember the dead heroine's surname.The story is not bad, but needs more fleshed-out characters, especially Alice Palmer, who should be the key to everything. She remains a cypher throughout the first half of the film, while she is the mystery to be solved.I think the documentary film approach employed here is not the right choice for the subject material which has potential for a better psychological thriller or drama. The entire cast did a decent job and the atmospheric cinematography is beautiful, but with the limited narrative devices what they can do is largely sit and talk to the camera. The twisted narrative in the second half (that reminds us of ""Lost Highway"") is a good idea, but is poorly executed partly because of the film's mocumentary style.Some part of ""Lake Mungo"" is pretty scary, especially the creepy mobile phone movie scene. With more conventional storytelling ""Lake Mungo"" could have been more effective.",3,(2.5 STARS) Atmospheric Thriller That Needs Another Narrative Style,1327968000,"01 31, 2012",2012,2075,"['THIS', 'REVIEW', 'INCLUDES', 'MINOR', 'SPOILERSOn', 'surface', 'Lake', 'Mungo', '2008', 'Australian', 'film', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'horror', 'mockumentary', 'narrative', 'Actually', 'film', 'writer', '/', 'director', 'Joel', 'Anderson', 'feature', 'debut', 'trying', 'be', 'something', 'different', 'something', 'unique', 'psychological', 'drama', 'grief-stricken', 'family', 'told', 'David', 'Lynch', 'touch.A', '16-year-old', 'girl', 'Alice', 'Palmer', 'Talia', 'Zucker', 'gone', 'missing', 'swimming', 'local', 'dam', 'later', 'found', 'dead', 'nothing', 'suspicious', 'death', 'burial', 'remaining', 'family', 'members', 'start', 'experience', 'strange', 'things', 'Shocked', 'unsettled', 'family', 'local', 'radio', 'psychic', 'Ray', 'Kemeny', 'Steve', 'Jodrell', 'only', 'discover', 'something', 'disturbing', 'Lake', 'Mungo', 'typical', 'ghost', 'story', 'later', 'unexpected', 'direction', 'more', 'once', 'Not', 'spoil', 'film', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'will', 'only', 'tell', 'film', 'less', 'what', 'who', 'are', 'being', 'interviewed', 'Alice', 'Palmer', 'when', 'was', 'alive', 'who', 'remember', 'certain', 'popular', 'TV', 'series', 'early', '1990s', 'may', 'remember', 'dead', 'heroine', 'surname.The', 'story', 'not', 'bad', 'more', 'fleshed-out', 'characters', 'especially', 'Alice', 'Palmer', 'who', 'should', 'be', 'key', 'everything', 'cypher', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'mystery', 'be', 'solved.I', 'think', 'documentary', 'film', 'approach', 'employed', 'here', 'not', 'right', 'choice', 'subject', 'material', 'potential', 'better', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'drama', 'entire', 'cast', 'did', 'decent', 'job', 'atmospheric', 'cinematography', 'beautiful', 'limited', 'narrative', 'devices', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'largely', 'sit', 'talk', 'camera', 'twisted', 'narrative', 'second', 'half', 'Lost', 'Highway', 'good', 'idea', 'poorly', 'executed', 'partly', 'film', 'mocumentary', 'style.Some', 'part', 'Lake', 'Mungo', 'pretty', 'scary', 'especially', 'creepy', 'mobile', 'phone', 'movie', 'scene', 'more', 'conventional', 'storytelling', 'Lake', 'Mungo', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'effective']",N/A
