It sure wasn't a blessing watching some of the most terrible storytelling I've ever seen.This movie has no atmosphere whatsoever. No drama, no suspense, no horror, no *anything*. It's very bland and ordinary.It's exactly this kind of rubbish that makes me wonder what goes through the minds of Hollywood writers sometimes. Did they really expect a masterpiece when they made this film? I sure hope not. I hope this movie was just some quick cash-in as part of some contractual agreement or something.  The thought that some time and effort was actually put into this would be... hard to believe.I've seen terrible films before, but this one takes the cake.The first 1 hour and 10 minutes of film is pure trash. That leaves 15 minutes for an ending that's actually alright because at least something good is shown near the end of the movie that *almost* makes the movie feel different from all those cheesy Lifetime Movie Network films and comparisons.I was so bored while watching this film, and Heather Graham's character does absolutely nothing for me either. This movie was doomed right from the beginning thanks to whoever came up with such a ""genius"" concept. A pregnant woman walks around with twin evil babies in her belly.*The entire film* deals with the mother worried about her twin babies. She constantly goes to the doctor for check-ups, but the thing is... what were WE supposed to get out of these constant visits? So what? She's having twins. I certainly didn't sense any evil presence lurking. So BAD.The storyline would have been significantly better had it focused on the babies actually being born and THEN doing evil things to other people. Then the movie would have actually built some kind of suspense. Maybe the movie writers thought such a storyline has already been done plenty of times before, but surely it would have been better than what we ended up with.And her husband? And the guy at the restaurant who tried warning her about the babies being born? Any suspense here? Nope, none whatsoever.I recommend (rather strongly in fact) AVOIDING this movie.",2,unacceptable,1264032000,"01 21, 2010",2010,2129,"['What', 'WORLD', 'happened', 'Blessed', 'Yeah', 'right', 'sure', 'was', ""n't"", 'blessing', 'watching', 'most', 'terrible', 'storytelling', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen.This', 'movie', 'atmosphere', 'whatsoever', 'drama', 'suspense', 'horror', '*anything*', 'very', 'bland', 'exactly', 'kind', 'rubbish', 'wonder', 'what', 'minds', 'Hollywood', 'writers', 'sometimes', 'Did', 'really', 'expect', 'masterpiece', 'when', 'made', 'film', 'sure', 'hope', 'not', 'hope', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'quick', 'cash-in', 'part', 'contractual', 'agreement', 'something', 'thought', 'time', 'effort', 'was', 'actually', 'put', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'believe.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'terrible', 'films', 'one', 'cake.The', 'first', '1', 'hour', '10', 'minutes', 'film', 'pure', 'trash', '15', 'minutes', 'ending', 'actually', 'alright', 'least', 'something', 'good', 'shown', 'end', 'movie', '*almost*', 'movie', 'feel', 'different', 'cheesy', 'Lifetime', 'Movie', 'Network', 'films', 'comparisons.I', 'was', 'so', 'bored', 'watching', 'film', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'character', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'movie', 'was', 'doomed', 'right', 'beginning', 'thanks', 'whoever', 'came', 'up', 'genius', 'concept', 'pregnant', 'woman', 'walks', 'twin', 'evil', 'babies', 'belly', '*The', 'entire', 'film*', 'deals', 'mother', 'worried', 'twin', 'babies', 'constantly', 'doctor', 'check-ups', 'thing', 'what', 'were', 'WE', 'supposed', 'get', 'constant', 'visits', 'what', 'having', 'twins', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'sense', 'evil', 'presence', 'lurking', 'BAD.The', 'storyline', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'significantly', 'better', 'had', 'focused', 'babies', 'actually', 'being', 'born', 'THEN', 'doing', 'evil', 'things', 'other', 'people', 'Then', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'actually', 'built', 'kind', 'suspense', 'Maybe', 'movie', 'writers', 'thought', 'storyline', 'already', 'been', 'done', 'plenty', 'times', 'surely', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'what', 'ended', 'up', 'with.And', 'husband', 'guy', 'restaurant', 'who', 'tried', 'warning', 'babies', 'being', 'born', 'suspense', 'here', 'Nope', 'none', 'whatsoever.I', 'recommend', 'rather', 'strongly', 'fact', 'AVOIDING', 'movie']",N/A

Heather Graham and James Purefoy portray a young couple unable to conceive a child.  They stumble upon a clinic that uses in vitro fertilization to help them along.

854912,A20NJAPECFGIR9,B00049QP3I,"nina ""Movie Maiden""","[1, 1]","Once again here is a dumb movie that starts out with potential but can't live up to it past the first thirty minutes. I watched this because it was supposed to be based on Rosemary's Baby. Maybe it is but it is the lame, watered down, completely unscary version. To give you an idea, think of this as a made-for-cable TV movie equivalent of Rosemary's Baby.You have Samantha (Heather Graham) and I can't even remember the husband's name played by James Purefoy. It doesn't matter because his name like anything else is completely insignificant. Well Samantha is a school teacher (who went to work probably once the entire film), the husband is a struggling writer (how creative!) and they are desperate to have kids. Every time Samantha sees a child she longs for her own. Teaching kids all day makes it hard since she cannot have one of their own.The couple decides to go to a fertility center and Sam is implanted by, (gasp!) the Demon Seed! That's right. The fertility center has impregnated her with two twins both spawns of Satan himself. Meanwhile the husband gets a literary agent and publisher (both in less than a week!) and the publisher is so ridiculously creepy down to his horn-shaped eyebrows that Stevie Wonder would know this is supposed to be the devil. Yet Sam and her husband have no idea. The man shows up and makes all of the husband's dreams come true. Suddenly his book is doing so well he's going on a book tour! Sigh. Being a writer, the way they portray how easy it is to get an agent and sell a book in these movies is sickening but I held my stomach and kept watching. After all this wasn't the worse thing about the movie.Soon after Sam's pregnant strange things begin to occur. She sees funny faces when the woman does her ultrasound. She hears growling coming from her stomach. Her babies are clawing her from the inside out and a strange man in a black hoodie begins following her. Despite all this, Sam is only concerned for about five minutes then she's back to singing ""Skippidy Do Da"" like nothing ever happened.After an hour of nothingness we finally get to the core of what's happened but by then it's too late. A three year-old could tell what's gonna happen before the end. The movie was tragic and the ending was pathetic.This film was wrong in so many ways. The main characters had no chemistry, were boring and unbelievable. The husband acted like he couldn't care less what happened with the babies and never did anything with Samantha while she was pregnant. You've wanted kids for years and your wife gets her chance and all you care about is your book? Completely unbelievable. The writing was dull and the terror was nonexistent. There was nothing scary about this movie. Rosemary's Baby was such a hit because of how it captured you with such underlying suspense and creepiness. This film wished it could be half as brilliant as Rosemary's Baby. I've seen comedies scarier than this!Please do not buy this movie. It's not worth buying even from the used section! I wouldn't pay 5 dollars for this unless you're just a big fan of the actors. Watch it on cable like I did if you must but take it from me, you don't have to.I don't recommend this movie to anyone. This is the dumbest, most lackluster, pitiful excuse of a thriller/horror I've ever seen. I could've excused some of the silliness if it had at least been scary.",1,Rosemary's Baby?

854915,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00049QP3I,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 7]","'Blessed' (2004) is a UK-Romanian product featuring Heather Graham, James Purefoy, Andy Sarkis, David Hemmings (his last film), Fionnula Flanagan, and Stella Stevens, directed by first-time director Simon Fellows.So ... 'Blessed' is, as the title suggests, an occult thriller, of which basic story resembles that of one Mia Farrow film made in '68, so if you have seen THAT classic, you don't need any further comments from me.  Yes, the film is about Heather Graham's heroine Samantha, who receives a medical treatment in a clinic to have a baby.  It succeeds, and Samantha, now pregnant, is very happy until she notices that she starts to feel weird things.  Like, someone is watching her; or, the next-door neighbors are missing; or, she sees strange visions, or ... well, you see the drift of the story now.Let's not talk about the obvious similarity with the past films.  The real trouble is that the film is not scary, suspenceful, or whatever interesting in any way.  The first half of the film is particularly dull, though the director tries to give us a shock or two -- with tantalizing music score and things suddenly appearing on the screen -- but they are all tired tricks the fans would never like.In the second half, things get slightly better, for you see at least some things happen.  However, all of them are predictable, and even the reliable actors like Andy Sarkis (no Gollum CGI here, but sporting a curious Iralian accent) cannot raise this B-film higher than it is.  You see, while there should be more mysterious mood in the film's world, and actually the film offers something like mystery, what we really see is ridiculous outcomes of it, or too familiar explanations.During the shooting of the film, David Hemmings who plays one of the key roles had a fatal heart attack, and sadly he passed away.  The producers, heavily shocked, knew that there still were some important scenes in which his character must appear.  (It seems the producers used CGIs and a stunt to finish the production.)  This tragic incident might still have something to do with the film's failure to fully explain the story, the characters, or their motives.But I don't think 'Blessed' could be a success, commercial or artistic, from the beginning.  There is little thrill, even cheap ones, in the pedestrian story which looks like going on and on automatically.
