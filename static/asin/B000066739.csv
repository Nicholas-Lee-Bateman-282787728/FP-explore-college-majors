Cecena ""ssjanifan""","[4, 7]","Now this was a primary example of how to make a good hour-long fight scene, unlike DBZ movie 7, which came after this one, and has to be the worst DBZ movie to date.  But let's talke about this one.  Yes, like Frieza, Cooler becomes a cyborg, luckily, it's done in an imaginitive way that keeps it from becoming a rehash of what happened to Cooler's dear brother.  The best part of this film is that Goku and Vegeta actually have to put aside their differences and WORK TOGETHER, something which they pretty much haven't done before.  That, and we get to see them both in SSJ form double-teaming Meta-Cooler, and even then they still can't defeat him!  Kuririn, Muten Roshi, Oolong, and Yajirobe are pretty much comic relief in this one, as all of them and Gohan are captured by Cooler's androids, and it's up to Piccolo to save them.  Of course, we don't care about that, we want to see Goku and Vegeta double-teaming an evil robot with the mind of an alien, and have to go all-out to defeat it.

700690,APWKSH4XINI0Q,B000066739,Kevin Artinian,"[1, 1]","Yes, I must admit Cooler's Revenge was better.  But this movie was still excellent, even if you haven't seen CR.  The story is as follows: New Namek is assaulted by a giant mechanical orb called the Big Gete Star.  Goku and friends arrive to stop the destruction of the planet, and ultimately have to face Cooler (Meta-Cooler), who has been resurrected as the alter-ego of the Gete Star's mainframe.  I'd admit the whole thing of Cooler's resurrection is kinda cheesy, but nevertheless he's really badass, having this symbiotic relationship with a seemingly indestructible computer.  The fight scenes are awesome, although I refuse to believe that Piccolo can survive having several barrels of machine gun fire directly into his head.  I mean, he is a Z-Fighter, and therefore can take minimal damage by sheer will power, but even that scene I find over-the-top . . . then again, it is DBZ.  Best of all is Vegeta's surprise appearance while Goku fights Meta-Cooler.  Without Vegeta's assistance, Cooler would've on hands down--which reminds me: this one has one of the most unusual and inventive villain-defeats ever, although I won't spoil it for you.

700696,A2RHBT46LS6DA3,B000066739,"Ryk E. Spoor ""Author, Gamer, Geek God""","[0, 0]","Oh, it's true -- DBZ has its formula. But as anyone following series knows, you can have good formula and bad formula.This is good formula. &quot;Return of Cooler&quot; (oddly, he's just called &quot;Coola&quot; in the subtitles) really should be watched with the preceding movie as a double-header, since Cooler makes his first appearance in that one. He's one of a very, VERY small number of villains to ever manage to fight Goku after having lost one to him.In this one, Cooler's come back as a cyborg, having fused with a Borg-like supermachine called &quot;Big Gete Star&quot; (I prefer the spellings of Gheti or Geti, but c'est la vie) that among other annoying traits allows his now-robotic body to repair itself at lightning speed. Cooler attacks New Namek, the planet the Namek-seijin went to after their original planet was destroyed in the battle between Goku and Freezer.(for the uninitiated, yes, the names are that silly. Toriyama-sensei is very fond of puns and in-jokes, and most names in Dragonball/DBZ refer to food, clothing, or appliances in some way)The Namek-seijin get help when their planet is attacked, in the form of Goku and his friends. This is just fine with Cooler, who was planning on hitting Earth next.What makes this one better than some of the others is that its battles do not follow the pure formula. There IS one DBZ movie that follows the formula to the letter and remains fun to watch (the next one -- Three Super Saiyajin), but on the whole it's better when there's unexpected twists. In this one Goku simply CANNOT win it alone and does need help, and their enemy is something beyond merely another Badass Warrior.The movie also gives us a bit more action from the other characters, giving even Kuririn, comic relief though he usually is, a few moments to kick some. Piccolo gets several cool moments, including one that really gives one an appreciation for why he's still sometimes considered to be on the top level of power.If you're a DBZ fan, this is one of the movies you really should own.Negative points:I've seen this one in letterbox format at least once; why that isn't on the DVD, I don't know.The translation in subtitles is... iffy. There aren't very many places where it's flat-out WRONG, but a number where the translated version doesn't get the right spirit or phrasing for what the original meant. (one subtle point which they and other fan-translators muck up is that when Goku first becomes Super-Saiyajin and Cooler comments on it, Cooler HESITATES. His voice makes clear that he's NOT quite as confident as he makes himself out to be, and that should be reflected in the subtitles.)It seems rather unfair that the English version gets a super-Dolby and we get Japanese Mono -- I believe this was released in theaters, which makes it hard to believe that there IS no stereo version of the Japanese. I suppose it's possible, of course, in which case there's nothing to be done -- you can't bring back the Japanese cast and re-record it (and even if you wanted to, at least one of the original VA's is dead now).",4,One of the better DBZ movies.,1029888000,"08 21, 2002",2002,3072,"['Oh', 'true', 'DBZ', 'formula', 'anyone', 'following', 'series', 'knows', 'can', 'have', 'good', 'formula', 'bad', 'formula.This', 'good', 'formula', 'quot', 'Return', 'Cooler', 'quot', 'oddly', 'just', 'called', 'quot', 'Coola', 'quot', 'subtitles', 'really', 'should', 'be', 'watched', 'preceding', 'movie', 'double-header', 'Cooler', 'first', 'appearance', 'one', 'one', 'very', 'VERY', 'small', 'number', 'villains', 'ever', 'manage', 'fight', 'Goku', 'having', 'lost', 'one', 'him.In', 'one', 'Cooler', 'come', 'back', 'cyborg', 'having', 'fused', 'Borg-like', 'supermachine', 'called', 'quot', 'Big', 'Gete', 'Star', 'quot', 'prefer', 'spellings', 'Gheti', 'Geti', ""c'est"", 'la', 'vie', 'other', 'annoying', 'traits', 'now-robotic', 'body', 'repair', 'lightning', 'speed', 'Cooler', 'New', 'Namek', 'planet', 'Namek-seijin', 'went', 'original', 'planet', 'was', 'destroyed', 'battle', 'Goku', 'Freezer', 'uninitiated', 'yes', 'names', 'are', 'silly', 'Toriyama-sensei', 'very', 'fond', 'puns', 'in-jokes', 'most', 'names', 'Dragonball/DBZ', 'refer', 'food', 'clothing', 'appliances', 'way', 'Namek-seijin', 'get', 'help', 'when', 'planet', 'attacked', 'form', 'Goku', 'friends', 'just', 'fine', 'Cooler', 'who', 'was', 'planning', 'hitting', 'Earth', 'next.What', 'one', 'better', 'others', 'battles', 'do', 'not', 'follow', 'pure', 'formula', 'one', 'DBZ', 'movie', 'formula', 'letter', 'fun', 'watch', 'next', 'one', 'Three', 'Super', 'Saiyajin', 'whole', 'better', 'when', 'unexpected', 'twists', 'one', 'Goku', 'simply', 'CAN', 'NOT', 'win', 'alone', 'need', 'help', 'enemy', 'something', 'merely', 'Badass', 'Warrior.The', 'movie', 'also', 'bit', 'more', 'action', 'other', 'characters', 'giving', 'even', 'Kuririn', 'comic', 'relief', 'usually', 'few', 'moments', 'kick', 'Piccolo', 'several', 'cool', 'moments', 'including', 'one', 'really', 'one', 'appreciation', 'why', 'still', 'sometimes', 'considered', 'be', 'top', 'level', 'power.If', ""'re"", 'DBZ', 'fan', 'one', 'movies', 'really', 'should', 'own.Negative', 'points', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'one', 'letterbox', 'format', 'least', 'once', 'why', ""n't"", 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'know.The', 'translation', 'subtitles', 'iffy', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'many', 'places', 'where', 'flat-out', 'WRONG', 'number', 'where', 'translated', 'version', ""n't"", 'get', 'right', 'spirit', 'phrasing', 'what', 'original', 'meant', 'one', 'subtle', 'point', 'other', 'fan-translators', 'muck', 'up', 'when', 'Goku', 'first', 'Super-Saiyajin', 'Cooler', 'comments', 'Cooler', 'HESITATES', 'voice', 'clear', 'NOT', 'quite', 'as', 'confident', 'be', 'should', 'be', 'reflected', 'subtitles', 'rather', 'unfair', 'English', 'version', 'super-Dolby', 'get', 'Japanese', 'Mono', 'believe', 'was', 'released', 'theaters', 'hard', 'believe', 'stereo', 'version', 'Japanese', 'suppose', 'possible', 'course', 'case', 'nothing', 'be', 'done', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bring', 'back', 'Japanese', 'cast', 're-record', 'even', 'wanted', 'least', 'one', 'original', 'VA', 'dead', 'now']",Dragon Ball Z - The Return of Cooler Uncut Feature

Well according to the mainstream story line he was either A: Training barbarically hard in the Capsule, B: Critically injured becasue of training and was in the sack with Bulnma or C: In Space Training.  With that said the story revolves around the Z fighters traeling to New Namek to take on a new menace that is attacking the NAmekians.  The crew is GOku, GOhan, Krillin, Oolong, and I think Piccolo (I am going based off memory here).  Once there they take on these cybornetic Beings that are challenging but not to bad.  Than Later COoler himself Shows up in a new Chrome outfit to take on Goku.  THey prove to be evenly matched as the otehr head towards the villians base to take it down.  SOmewhre along the lines Vegeta shows up as backup but early on just gets in the way.  LAter the two are captured and while in Super Sayin form release enough energy that COolers main frame (only his head and slight chunks of his body was saved from the sun) and destroy the ship.

And we do finally get to see Vegeta in a movie.  But, it's not quite enough to raise it above the last in my opinion.  The Japanese voices are as great as ever, but the recycled music is kinda... well, old.  The English dub is also sub-par.  The music in the English version is what really killed it though.  Compared to the metal rock in the last movie (which really gave the fights that extra push), this weird synthesized score really grates on my ears and makes the movie seem drawn out and slow.  I guess comparing the Japanese versions of Cooler's Revenge and The Return of Cooler put them on equal footing.  If you consider the English versions, this one falls a little short unfortunately.
