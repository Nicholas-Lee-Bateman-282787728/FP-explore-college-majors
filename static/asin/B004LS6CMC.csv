1414156,A3EXIUOGZVV132,B004LS6CMC,Stacy,"[1, 2]","Blood out is a good movie with a decent balance of action and character development. Michael is easy to like, especially if you enjoy tortured heroes. He's rugged but not lacking in emotion. The female lead expectedly flaunts her sexuality, but she's not just window dressing. It would have been nice to see her role expanded even more because she is an interesting character. Most of the secondary characters are also well done. This movie is about revenge, but also about redemption. Luke Goss fans and action fans in general don't miss this one. If I could rate this 4.5 I would have, since it's better than a 4.",4,Solid Action Movie - 4.5,1303776000,"04 26, 2011",2011,615,"['Blood', 'out', 'good', 'movie', 'decent', 'balance', 'action', 'character', 'development', 'Michael', 'easy', 'like', 'especially', 'enjoy', 'tortured', 'heroes', 'rugged', 'not', 'lacking', 'emotion', 'female', 'lead', 'expectedly', 'sexuality', 'not', 'just', 'window', 'dressing', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'role', 'expanded', 'even', 'more', 'interesting', 'character', 'Most', 'secondary', 'characters', 'are', 'also', 'well', 'done', 'movie', 'revenge', 'also', 'redemption', 'Luke', 'Goss', 'fans', 'action', 'fans', 'general', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'one', 'could', 'rate', '4.5', 'would', 'have', 'better', '4']",Blood Out
1414157,A3FDEI5P21XX6S,B004LS6CMC,"Steve Kuehl ""SLV Video""","[6, 7]","I had no expectations for this film so my poor review has nothing to do with expecting something decent, but there has been a bit of confusion with customers regarding this andGun [Blu-ray]; they both have 50 Cent and Kilmer, they both have the same cover art and they are both really bad.A standard cop revenge film with some solid urban music, hot ladies doing nasty things and Val Kilmer looking more and more like that greatAmerican Dad!, Vol. 6quote about becoming a pumpkin. But what surprised me is how incredible the BD quality is - flawless. The night shots, the close-ups, and even the out of focus shots all looked amazingly clear and vibrant. Albeit this was difficult to see at times (did several pause-check stops to test clarity) as the director chose to do the really shaky-cam thing - irritating. The DTS was mixed well with only one editing flaw in the whole movie. Now for the laundry list of problems...Those looking for 50 Cent will be disappointed as he is in the movie for only a few minutes (but is prominently placed on the cover art). Val Kilmer walks onto the set for one sequence and was horrible. Vinnie Jones has a couple of sequences but he muddled through the lines (although he does get the cheesy car chase scene at the end of the film) - so the film rests on Luke Goss. He performs on par, but the best acting was actually from Ed Quinn ofEureka: Season Two. The cover art is so misleading with Luke Goss being given fourth billing but he is in almost every scene.The only supplement is a 16-minute interview piece that is clip-heavy and self congratulatory. Region coded A, English and Spanish subs. 1.5 stars for the film and 1.5 for the BD specs. A renter maybe, but you would have to be a hardcore Goss fan.",3,"Amazing Blu, below average B movie for everyone",1303430400,"04 22, 2011",2011,1746,"['had', 'expectations', 'film', 'so', 'poor', 'review', 'nothing', 'do', 'expecting', 'something', 'decent', 'there', 'been', 'bit', 'confusion', 'customers', 'regarding', 'andGun', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'have', '50', 'Cent', 'Kilmer', 'have', 'same', 'cover', 'art', 'are', 'really', 'bad.A', 'standard', 'cop', 'revenge', 'film', 'solid', 'urban', 'music', 'hot', 'ladies', 'doing', 'nasty', 'things', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'looking', 'more', 'more', 'greatAmerican', 'Dad', 'Vol', '6quote', 'becoming', 'pumpkin', 'what', 'surprised', 'how', 'incredible', 'BD', 'quality', 'flawless', 'night', 'shots', 'close-ups', 'even', 'out', 'focus', 'shots', 'looked', 'amazingly', 'clear', 'vibrant', 'was', 'difficult', 'see', 'times', 'did', 'several', 'pause-check', 'stops', 'test', 'clarity', 'director', 'chose', 'do', 'really', 'shaky-cam', 'thing', 'irritating', 'DTS', 'was', 'mixed', 'well', 'only', 'one', 'editing', 'flaw', 'whole', 'movie', 'Now', 'laundry', 'list', 'problems', 'looking', '50', 'Cent', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'only', 'few', 'minutes', 'prominently', 'placed', 'cover', 'art', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'walks', 'set', 'one', 'sequence', 'was', 'horrible', 'Vinnie', 'Jones', 'couple', 'sequences', 'muddled', 'lines', 'get', 'cheesy', 'car', 'chase', 'scene', 'end', 'film', 'film', 'rests', 'Luke', 'Goss', 'par', 'best', 'acting', 'was', 'actually', 'Ed', 'Quinn', 'ofEureka', 'Season', 'Two', 'cover', 'art', 'so', 'misleading', 'Luke', 'Goss', 'being', 'given', 'fourth', 'billing', 'almost', 'scene.The', 'only', 'supplement', '16-minute', 'interview', 'piece', 'clip-heavy', 'self', 'congratulatory', 'Region', 'coded', 'A', 'English', 'Spanish', 'subs', '1.5', 'stars', 'film', '1.5', 'BD', 'specs', 'renter', 'maybe', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'hardcore', 'Goss', 'fan']",Blood Out

After his brother is brutally murdered Sherriff Spencer (Luke Goss) is let down by the people he hoped would help.  Taking matters into his own hands he goes undercover in the gang that did it in order to get revenge.  Looking at the cover it seems like another 50-cent/Val Kilmer movie, which makes you think twice about getting it.  Vinnie Jones, Fiddy and Kilmer have a total screen time of about 2 minutes.  Luke Goss is the main star of the movie.  I was not expecting alot being that I thought it as a 50 cent/Kilmer movie, although ""Gun"" was not as bad as I expected so I had a little more expectations for this one.  This was a movie that started off flat and never improved. The acting wasn't as bad as I expected though. It was not terrible, but had all the drama and excitement of watching a dog play fetch, fun for a while then just sitting waiting for it to end.
