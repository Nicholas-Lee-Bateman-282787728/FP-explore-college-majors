It's kind of a surprise when you think about it. The cast is a rather accomplished group, expecially Hilary Swank who has the lead role of the daring aviator Amelia Earhart.What exactly went wrong? Well one thing we learn is that just because someone happens to be a iconic historical figure doesn't necessarily translate to a good subject matter for a feature film. Whether what we see on the screen is an accurate portrayal of the characters involved or not, what the viewing audience is presented with is a rather boring, needy, unlikeable group of individuals. One of the big problems with any biographical film is that you already know how it's going to end so the only thing that makes watching worthwhile is ones ability to establish a personal connection with the characters. Through that bond we become involved in the story line and the onscreen relationships as they move towards that inevitable conclusion. In this case the crash didn't come soon enough.What made this movie even less appealing to me was the filmmakers attempt to make up for the stories lack of substance by inserting meaningful words of wisdom, or poetic utterances from Amelia here and there against the backdrop of beautiful aerial landscape. It was like listening to a Rod McKuen reading.Plain and simple, `Amelia' just didn't work on any level. Not as a insightful biography, a heart wrenching romance, or a nostalgic period piece.

1315285,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B0030E5NJ6,Chris Pandolfi,"[13, 15]","""Amelia"" is a perfectly adequate biopic, although I was hoping for more. Part of the problem is that it adheres to the conventions of the average historical drama, with moments of sweeping music, visually stunning landscapes, and voiceover narrations so perfectly placed that you can't help but feel a little manipulated. They're all provided by the title character, aviation pioneer Amelia Earheart (Hilary Swank), who disappeared in July of 1937 over the Pacific as she attempted to circumnavigate the globe; her words give us no more or less than poetic musings about the freedom of flying, the beauty of the sky, and the joy of living a dream. These bits of dialogue are not badly written, but honestly, is there nothing left to say that's original? For a film about a fascinating woman who lived a very fascinating life, I was surprised at just how generic it all seemed.But let's not sell this movie short. Swank is perfectly cast, not only because her physical appearance is stunningly similar to Earhart's, but also because she gives yet another wonderful performance. We see a brave, determined, and sometimes stubborn woman who wanted to pave the way for other female pilots. Granted, we pretty much already knew this; numerous written accounts, some written by Earhart, cemented our perceptions of her a long time ago. Still, it's always a pleasure to see an actor taking someone else's qualities, mimicking them, and making the audience believe them. Swank has that kind of power, as she already demonstrated in films like ""Boys Don't Cry"" and ""Million Dollar Baby."" We see her as Earhart and invest in every smile, every laugh, and every line of dialogue.The plot continuously shifts back and forth between her final flight and the events leading up to it, starting in 1928 with the introduction of George P. Putnam (Richard Gere). Putnam, a book publicist, was key in coordinating Earhart's flight across the Atlantic, which came at the heels of a similar flight taken by Charles Lindbergh a year earlier. While she was essentially a passenger, leaving the piloting to Wilmer Stultz (Joe Anderson) and Louis Gordon (Aaron Abrams), the flight was nonetheless an historic event, and even led to a ticker tape parade upon their return to New York City.In fact, it wasn't until 1932 that Earhart finally flew solo across the Atlantic, starting in Harbour Grace, Newfoundland and ending in Culmore, Northern Ireland. By then, she was actively involved in competitive flying, and we're shown the Santa-Monica-to-Cleveland Women's Air Derby of 1929, which involved a young, eager aviatrix named Elinor Smith (Mia Wasikowska). Earhart was also already a celebrity at that point, gaining fame through a series of lecturing tours and product endorsements. She promoted everything from luggage to women's sportswear to chewing gum to Lucky Strike cigarettes, which was odd since she was a nonsmoker. While not exactly thrilled with the idea of being an advertising mascot, the money she earned did help finance future flying excursions.In the midst of her professional career, she found herself romantically torn between Putnam and Gene Vidal (Ewan McGregor), the pioneer of the commercial aviation industry (he was also the father of Gore Vidal, seen as a child and much adored by Earhart). He's indeed dashing and a charmer, unlike Putnam, who seems awfully stiff and businesslike. He and Earhart, however, have already gotten married. Granted, he was much more willing to be married than she was; historically, it's said that Putnam had to propose six times before Earhart finally agreed to marry him in 1931. Even then, her views remained liberal; in a written statement addressed to him, she said, ""I want you to understand I shall not hold you to any medieval code of faithfulness to me, nor shall I consider myself bound to you similarly.""Her 1937 world flight with aviator Fred Noonan (Christopher Eccleston) and their eventual disappearance are handled appropriately. The final communications between Earhart and the crew of the USGC ship ""Itasca"" are effectively tense, made better by the fact that the dialogue is virtually identical to the actual radio transmissions. What exactly did become of her and Noonan? Two prevailing theories are equally plausible: Either Earhart's Electra ran out of fuel and sank after crashing into the South Pacific, or they landed on Gardner Island (now called Nikumaroro) and eventually died of dehydration/starvation. There is evidence to support the second theory, including the discovery of a skeleton and a sextant box during a 1940 colonial expedition. It's circumstantial at best, but it's engrossing just the same.If only the rest of the film were as effective. Much of ""Amelia"" is greatly romanticized, pretty much to the point where it seems condescending. Do we really need to hear lyrical odes to the sky, the ocean, and the adventure that is life? You expect this kind of treatment in melodramas like ""Gone with the Wind,"" which naturally give license to epic production values and grandiose performances. Here, it feels like padding, a way to avoid delving deeper into character. Amelia Earhart went through history as an icon of perseverance and strength, and the movie treats her the same way. Unfortunately, this came at the expense of more personal touches, like the very life experiences that molded Earhart into the image we know today. Were it not for Swank's performance and the beautiful imagery, ""Amelia"" probably would have fallen from the weight of its cargo.",4,Lady Lindy's Fateful Flight,1256515200,"10 26,

Swank captures the Earhart of the clips we've all seen:  confident, open-hearted, with a hint of impish delight and tomboy charm.  Swank makes Earthart's ascent to celebrity entirely believable as she radiates passion for flying and for using her pioneer flight as a platform to encourage all women to reach for their dreams.  Richard Gere, as her eventual husband G.P. Putnam, puts in a somewhat lackluster performance that has glimpses of affection but not much depth. Yes, he is that ""speck of dust in (Earhart's/Swank's) constellation.""  The real mystery to this film is not what happened to Earhart, but why the screenwriters chose to feature the pilot's connection to Gore Vidal, a child at the time, and why Ewan McGregor's turn as Vidal's father Gene is so wooden and  . . . well, boring.  This side plot of an affair and Earhart's connection to the Vidals is never confronted beyond a few fleeting moments.  Multiple shots of a young, infatuated Gore add nothing but so-what filler.  It almost seems as though director Mira Nair and the screenwriters thought America needed a whiff of scandal and connection to other celebrities to make it into a hit.  Ironically, given what Earhart wanted to stand for, the filmmakers seemed to have believed that her accomplishments alone could not have carried this film.  And for a woman who seemed anything but sentimental, the film threatens to become maudlin at every turn.Despite the flaws, the film is worth seeing for Swank's performance and a handful of scenes critical of  the way Earhart was treated, thus lessening the sentimentality:  her role as an arm-candy passenger in her first trans-Atlantic flight, her commercial exploitation at the hands of her husband, and the dubious way she won the first women's air race, all designed to brand the Earhart name.  It's no wonder that she wanted to make the first around-the-world flight, perhaps to have something real she could point to as an accomplishment.I recommend this film for those who have already seen the best films out in the theaters.  Not bad but not great, either, ""Amelia"" is the type of film that can help pass a rainy afternoon or evening without begging for another viewing.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann",4,An extra star for Hillary Swank's performance,1257120000,"11 2, 2009",2009,2441,"['bio-pic', 'Amelia', 'Earhart', 'rise', 'America', 'sweetheart-in-a-jumpsuit', 'last', 'moments', 'alive', 'would', 'rate', 'two', 'most', 'three', 'stars', 'not', 'Hillary', 'Swank', 'likable', 'honest', 'portrait', 'title', 'character', 'Swank', 'Earhart', 'clips', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'confident', 'open-hearted', 'hint', 'impish', 'delight', 'tomboy', 'charm', 'Swank', 'Earthart', 'ascent', 'celebrity', 'entirely', 'believable', 'passion', 'flying', 'using', 'pioneer', 'flight', 'platform', 'encourage', 'women', 'reach', 'dreams', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'eventual', 'husband', 'G.P', 'Putnam', 'somewhat', 'lackluster', 'performance', 'glimpses', 'affection', 'not', 'much', 'depth', 'Yes', 'speck', 'dust', ""Earhart's/Swank"", 'constellation', 'real', 'mystery', 'film', 'not', 'what', 'happened', 'Earhart', 'why', 'screenwriters', 'chose', 'feature', 'pilot', 'connection', 'Gore', 'Vidal', 'child', 'time', 'why', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'turn', 'Vidal', 'father', 'Gene', 'so', 'wooden', 'well', 'boring', 'side', 'plot', 'affair', 'Earhart', 'connection', 'Vidals', 'never', 'confronted', 'few', 'fleeting', 'moments', 'Multiple', 'shots', 'young', 'infatuated', 'Gore', 'add', 'nothing', 'so-what', 'filler', 'almost', 'director', 'Mira', 'Nair', 'screenwriters', 'thought', 'America', 'needed', 'whiff', 'scandal', 'connection', 'other', 'celebrities', 'make', 'hit', 'Ironically', 'given', 'what', 'Earhart', 'wanted', 'stand', 'filmmakers', 'seemed', 'have', 'believed', 'accomplishments', 'alone', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'carried', 'film', 'woman', 'who', 'seemed', 'anything', 'sentimental', 'film', 'become', 'maudlin', 'turn.Despite', 'flaws', 'film', 'worth', 'seeing', 'Swank', 'performance', 'handful', 'scenes', 'critical', 'way', 'Earhart', 'was', 'treated', 'thus', 'lessening', 'sentimentality', 'role', 'arm-candy', 'passenger', 'first', 'trans-Atlantic', 'flight', 'commercial', 'exploitation', 'hands', 'husband', 'dubious', 'way', 'won', 'first', 'women', 'air', 'race', 'designed', 'brand', 'Earhart', 'name', 'wonder', 'wanted', 'make', 'first', 'around-the-world', 'flight', 'perhaps', 'have', 'something', 'real', 'could', 'point', 'accomplishment.I', 'recommend', 'film', 'who', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'best', 'films', 'out', 'theaters', 'Not', 'bad', 'not', 'great', 'either', 'Amelia', 'type', 'film', 'can', 'help', 'pass', 'rainy', 'afternoon', 'evening', 'begging', 'viewing.', 'Debbie', 'Lee', 'Wesselmann']",N/A
1315289,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B0030E5NJ6,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[0, 1]","In 2009, the biopic based on the life of Amelia Earhart was released in theaters back in Oct. 2009.Adapted from the following books ""East To The Dawn: The Life of Amelia Earhart"" by Susan Butler and ""The Sound of Wings: The Life of Amelia Earhart"" by Mary S. Lovell.  The film is directed by Mira Nair (""Monsoon Wedding"", ""Vanity Fair"", ""Migration"") and a screenplay by Ronald Bass (""Entrapment"", ""Swingvote"", ""How Stella Got Her Groove Back"") and Anna Hamilton Phelan (""Girl, Interrupted"", ""Mask"", ""Gorillas in the Mist: The Story of Dian Fossey"").The film chronicles the life of Amelia Earhart (played by Hilary Swank, ""Million Dollar Baby"", ""Freedom Writers"", ""P.S. I Love You"") as she becomes a young woman who grew up in Kansas and became the woman who inspired many women and America by being the first Aviatrix to fly solo across the Atlantic,  formation of The Ninety-Nines, an organization of female pilots and her involvement in various commercials, speaking engagements and a woman who was passionate about flying.""Amelia"" also focuses on her independence as a woman, her marriage to George Putnam (played by Richard Gere, ""Pretty Woman"", ""Chicago"", ""Primal Fear""), the well-known publishing tycoon and also managed Amelia Earhart's business affairs and eventually marrying her.  But also shows her affair to Gene Vidal (the founder of Eastern Airlines, TWA and Northeast Airlines) and Amelia caring for his son Gore Vidal (who would become the famous author, playwright and political activist).This is the first film to showcase Amelia Earhart as a person who loved flying but also showed a personal side that many people may not have been familiar of the aviation pioneer.  Also, showing her goal to fly across the Atlantic, then doing it solo and then eventually setting a goal to travel around the world in 1937 with her Lockheed Electra 10E plane along with her navigator Fred Noonan (played by Christopher Eccleston, ""Heroes"", ""G.I. Joe: Rise of Cobra"", ""Doctor Who"").  And the final tragic day (July 2, 1937) when both disappeared over the central Pacific Ocean.VIDEO:""Amelia"" is featured in 1080p High Definition, Widescreen 2:35:1.  The cinematographer for the film ""Amelia"" was Stuart Drybergh (""Nim's Island"", ""Aeon Flux"", ""Kate & Leopold"", ""Bridget Jone's Diary"") and if there was one thing he brought to this film was bringing out the beautiful colors of the film.  From the various lush and beautiful scenery of where Amelia has arrived at in various countries, the Blu-ray release captures plenty of detail.  From the faux freckles on Hilary Swank, the detail on the plane, the reds are absolutely vibrant, the paint on the walls where you can see the paint grooves to the rivets of the airplane.There is plenty of detail in the film.  Looks like Drybergh also experimented with several stocks of film as some scenes look very different earlier on and not as consistent with the majority of scenes of the film.  But for the most part, Drybergh does a fine job in capturing the beauty of the countries of where Amelia lands to the overall, capturing of the late '20s and early '30s.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:Audio is presented  in 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio.  You can hear the rotors spinning, the engines running and just the plane sounding really nice and clear.  Good use of sound traveling from left to right and hearing the thunderstorms give a nice kick to the surrounds but for the most part, aside from the flight scenes which are front and center channel driven, a lot of the film is dialogue driven.  Dialogue is crystal clear along with the music by Gabriel Yared (""Shall We Dance"", ""Autumn in New York"").Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Amelia"" comes with the following special features:* Deleted Scenes - (13:53) A total of ten deleted scenes.* Making Amelia - (23:06) The making of ""Amelia"".  Interviews with director Mira Nair and the cast.  The crew talk about Amelia Earhart and George Putnam.* The Power of Amelia Earhart - (10:45) Director Mira Nair and the cast talk about why Amelia is a hero and why she is a remarkable individual.* The Plane Behind the Legend - (4:33) A featurette about the Lockheed Electra plane and finding an actual working Electra and bringing it from Europe to South Africa for the filming of ""Amelia"".* Re-Constructing the Planes of Amelia - (6:35) A featurette on the reconstruction of the classic planes used in the film ""Amelia"".* Movietone News Reels - (6:41) The following vintage Movietone news reels are included: ""Mrs. Putnam Flies the Atlantic Again - This Time Alone"", ""Amelia Earhart Flies Over the U.S. in 17 Hours"", ""Miss Earhart Flies from Hawaii to U.S. to win Solo Crown"", ""Aviation (Introducing the Electra)"", ""Aviation (Amelia Testing Her Plane)"", ""Names in the News: Amelia Earhart"", ""Race to Rescue Amelia Earhart"".EXTRAS:* Digital Copy - A Digital Copy of ""Amelica"" for Portable Media Players is included.JUDGMENT CALL:""Amelia"" is a film that could only go so far.  As a biopic on Amelia Earhart, the film works as it does detail her life and her passion of flying and how she took part in various engagements.  Granted, I had no idea that Amelia had an affair nor did I know that she had this free-spirit and independence when it came to her personal affairs.But without making the film to Hollywood, I really don't know how far director Mira Nair could have gone with the film.  She's portrayed as a hero, an inspiration to women and also a person who has her share of vulnerabilities.  She was a normal person doing what she loves and people putting her on the pedestal, so I can see why she wanted to escape the skies.  It was literally her way of getting far from the cameras, the media and just regaining her sanity by herself or just being in the most comfortable place that she knew... inside her plane, flying in the sky and seeing the planet's beauty.Needless to say, the film may not have done too well in the theaters but you have to admire Hilary Swank's performance.  Once again she manages to capture a character really well especially the look, the talk, the walk of Amelia Earhart, this is an actress who thoroughly does her research and it shows in the film.  But in today's film, people want to see the scandals, the controversy or something with conflict and I suppose when it comes to Amelia Earhart, it's really hard to find any conflict with his heroine.  She was smart, she was independent and she enjoyed flying.  Where in many films, we are used to hearing something bad or controversial in biopics of an individual, Earhart is pretty much a safe character.  As opposed to aviation pioneer Charles Lindbergh who's life had personal tragedy especially the ""Crime of the Century"" in 1932, when his young baby was kidnapped and found dead (and led to the Lindbergh Law).I suppose when it comes to Amelia Earhart, there seems to be more interest on what happened to her and Noonan in 1937.  With reports that they survived and are going by another name to crashing in this location and that location to even rumors that they were shot down during World War II or captured by the Japanese and executed in Saipan.  The fact that the wreckage has not been found has led to so much speculation of what may have happened.  Over 80-years later, you would think today's technology would have shed some light of what may have happened but as of now, nothing yet.  But if anything, these theories have only kept interest in Amelia Earhart going strong and hopefully the film, can show people of today's generation about her importance in America and her accomplishments.For those who are curious about Amelia Earhart, the Blu-ray does contain a good number of special features about the aviation pioneer.  The Blu-ray also features solid picture quality and lossless audio that is quite adequate for this kind of film.  A digital copy does come with the Blu-ray release of ""Amelia"".Overall, ""Amelia"" is not a great film, nor is it a bad film.  It's a straight up biopic of the life of Amelia Earhart and features a good number of talent and a solid performance by Hilary Swank.  If you are interested in the life of Amelia Earhart, the Blu-ray release and its numerous content on the popular American heroine is definitely recommended.",3,Blu-ray: A solid performance by Hilary Swank as Amelia Earhart but a film that is just average and nothing more.,1267488000,"03 2, 2010",2010,8264,"['2009', 'biopic', 'based', 'life', 'Amelia', 'Earhart', 'was', 'released', 'theaters',

Sorel ""book lovah""","[0, 0]","Being that most people are familiar with Amelia Earhart's story, the director decided to put the plot in a blender and shoot the audience through time. This would not have been so frustrating if the scenes were longer than a couple of minutes (which they were not!). Just as the audience felt that they were settling into a scene, the director would not only change to another but would switch to a completely different decade. Sadly, there was very little background into Amelia's childhood or upbringing which made her gusto and bravado seem unwarranted. However, Hilary Swank did an incredible job playing the part. I have to say that had the movie been a one woman show of Hilary Swank playing Amelia, I would have wept with joy! She really nailed the persona and was able to show the multiple sides of Amelia's personality. Still, the director chose to focus more on the romance between Amelia and her husband which was dull not to mention that Swank and Gere have no chemistry. The movie could have been slightly improved if the director had merely decided to run the plot chronologically instead of chopped up which left the viewers saying ""wait...is this the flight where she dies? wait....was that the flight where she dies?"".

1315294,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0030E5NJ6,Ed Uyeshima,"[6, 9]","On the surface, there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with this 2009 biopic of legendary aviatrix Amelia Earhart. Stephanie Carroll's production design, Stuart Dryburgh's cinematography and Gabriel Yared's (The Lives of Others) musical score are all appropriately evocative in recreating the vintage feeling of pioneering hope that Earhart represented during the Great Depression. However, there is a serious problem with the execution of this movie because dramatically, it feels strangely inert and worse, rather inconsequential. Part of the problem is our familiarity with Earhart's own rule-breaking story and her mysterious death over the Pacific. The challenge of making something fresh and inventive out of her mythic life proves too much for director Mira Nair (The Namesake) and screenwriters Ron Bass (Rain Man) and Anna Hamilton Phelan (Girl, Interrupted), who base their script on separate biographies by Susan Butler and Mary S. Lovell. In combination, they respond with a predictable pile of clich&eacute;s about heroism, infidelity, proto-feminism, and the mantra of daring to dream.With Earhart's doomed last flight in 1937 providing the narrative frame, the story skims the basic facts of her life with the main emphasis placed on her last decade beginning with her first transatlantic flight in 1928. This flashback technique necessitates the constant superimposition of titles detailing locales and years since there is little else that would give us a clue where we are in the tired soap opera being told. In episodic form, Earhart's ambition is shown with little personal drive onscreen, and her allegedly adulterous affair with Gene Vidal, an aeronautics engineer for the FDR administration, comes across more clinical than passionate. Also given short shrift is her complicated marriage to publishing tycoon George Putnam, whose previous success in chronicling Charles Lindbergh's life story drove him to make Earhart a merchandising bonanza. Beyond that, we simply see Earhart breaking all distance records for flying, and the story eventually catches up with her final flight.Even this climactic episode, played out in so many previous incarnations, lacks the propulsive conviction to save the movie from itself. See Yves Simoneau's 1994Amelia Earhart: The Final Flight(with Diane Keaton as Earhart) for a much more affecting recreation. Looking and even sounding a bit like a toothsome, mid-1930's reincarnation of Katharine Hepburn, Hilary Swank would seem to be the ideal embodiment of Earhart given her androgynous look and determined personality. However, she is left stranded by a script that gives her little to work with beyond providing a glib, glossy sheen to an oversimplified characterization. It's a shame given the actress's innate talent for bringing heart to misunderstood characters, but neither she nor Nair can come close to revealing Earhart's soul. As Vidal, Ewan McGregor makes little impression with his opaque character overshadowed by his precocious son who would grow up to become author Gore Vidal.Richard Gere fares a little better as Putnam as he reverts back to the pained husband he played in Adrian Lyne'sUnfaithfulwhen the affair is exposed. Unfortunately, the love story between Putnam and Earhart never takes hold over the story being told. Of the supporting cast, only Christopher Eccleston makes an impression as navigator Fred Noonan, who is constantly battling his alcoholism on that fateful flight. Cherry Jones has a rather incongruous cameo as a dotty Eleanor Roosevelt to whom Earhart allows to take the controls of a nocturnal flight over Washington D.C. There is no commentary track accompanying the 2010 DVD, but there is, of course, the standard making-of feature, which runs 23 minutes. In addition, there are ten deleted scenes, none of which would have provided much value to the final product despite the intriguing casting of Virginia Madsen as Putnam's first wife. There are other shorter featurettes focused on Earhart herself, her plane, and the meticulous recreation of the period aircraft, plus seven vintage newsreels.",2,Leaden Direction and a Flat Script Weigh Down a Biopic That Refuses to Take Flight,1265500800,"02 7, 2010",2010,4103,"['surface', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'anything', 'wrong', '2009', 'biopic', 'legendary', 'aviatrix', 'Amelia', 'Earhart', 'Stephanie', 'Carroll', 'production', 'design', 'Stuart', 'Dryburgh', 'cinematography', 'Gabriel', 'Yared', 'Lives', 'Others', 'musical', 'score', 'are', 'appropriately', 'evocative', 'recreating', 'vintage', 'feeling', 'pioneering', 'hope', 'Earhart', 'represented', 'Great', 'Depression', 'However', 'serious', 'problem', 'execution', 'movie', 'dramatically', 'strangely', 'inert', 'worse', 'rather', 'inconsequential', 'Part', 'problem', 'familiarity', 'Earhart', 'own', 'rule-breaking', 'story', 'mysterious', 'death', 'Pacific', 'challenge', 'making', 'something', 'fresh', 'inventive', 'out', 'mythic', 'life', 'too', 'much', 'director', 'Mira', 'Nair', 'Namesake', 'screenwriters', 'Ron', 'Bass', 'Rain', 'Man', 'Anna', 'Hamilton', 'Phelan', 'Girl', 'Interrupted', 'who', 'base', 'script', 'separate', 'biographies', 'Susan', 'Butler', 'Mary', 'S.', 'Lovell', 'combination', 'respond', 'predictable', 'pile', 'clich', 'eacute', 'heroism', 'infidelity', 'proto-feminism', 'mantra', 'daring', 'dream.With', 'Earhart', 'doomed', 'last', 'flight', '1937', 'providing', 'narrative', 'frame', 'story', 'basic', 'facts', 'life', 'main', 'emphasis', 'placed', 'last', 'decade', 'beginning', 'first', 'transatlantic', 'flight', '1928', 'flashback', 'technique', 'constant', 'superimposition', 'titles', 'detailing', 'locales', 'years', 'little', 'else', 'would', 'give', 'clue', 'where', 'are', 'tired', 'soap', 'opera', 'being', 'told', 'episodic', 'form', 'Earhart', 'ambition', 'shown', 'little', 'personal', 'drive', 'onscreen', 'allegedly', 'adulterous', 'affair', 'Gene', 'Vidal', 'aeronautics', 'engineer', 'FDR', 'administration', 'more', 'clinical', 'passionate', 'Also', 'given', 'short', 'shrift', 'complicated', 'marriage', 'publishing', 'tycoon', 'George', 'Putnam', 'previous', 'success', 'chronicling', 'Charles', 'Lindbergh', 'life', 'story', 'drove', 'make', 'Earhart', 'merchandising', 'bonanza', 'Beyond', 'simply', 'see', 'Earhart', 'breaking', 'distance', 'records', 'flying', 'story', 'eventually', 'up', 'final', 'flight.Even', 'climactic', 'episode', 'played', 'out', 'so', 'many', 'previous', 'incarnations', 'propulsive', 'conviction', 'save', 'movie', 'See', 'Yves', 'Simoneau', '1994Amelia', 'Earhart', 'Final', 'Flight', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'Earhart', 'much', 'more', 'affecting', 'recreation', 'Looking', 'even', 'sounding', 'bit', 'toothsome', 'mid-1930', 'reincarnation', 'Katharine', 'Hepburn', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'would', 'seem', 'be', 'ideal', 'embodiment', 'Earhart', 'given', 'androgynous', 'look', 'determined', 'personality', 'However', 'left', 'stranded', 'script', 'little', 'work', 'providing', 'glib', 'glossy', 'sheen', 'oversimplified', 'characterization', 'shame', 'given', 'actress', 'innate', 'talent', 'bringing', 'heart', 'misunderstood', 'characters', 'Nair', 'can', 'come', 'close', 'revealing', 'Earhart', 'soul', 'Vidal', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'little', 'impression', 'opaque', 'character', 'overshadowed', 'precocious', 'son', 'who', 'would', 'grow', 'up', 'become', 'author', 'Gore', 'Vidal.Richard', 'Gere', 'little', 'better', 'as', 'Putnam', 'back', 'pained', 'husband', 'played', 'Adrian', ""Lyne'sUnfaithfulwhen"", 'affair', 'exposed', 'Unfortunately', 'love', 'story', 'Putnam', 'Earhart', 'never', 'hold', 'story', 'being', 'told', 'supporting', 'cast', 'only', 'Christopher', 'Eccleston', 'impression', 'navigator', 'Fred', 'Noonan', 'who', 'constantly', 'battling', 'alcoholism', 'fateful', 'flight', 'Cherry', 'Jones', 'rather', 'incongruous', 'cameo', 'dotty', 'Eleanor', 'Roosevelt', 'whom', 'Earhart', 'take', 'controls', 'nocturnal', 'flight', 'Washington', 'D.C', 'commentary', 'track', 'accompanying', '2010', 'DVD', 'course', 'standard', 'making-of', 'feature', '23', 'minutes', 'addition', 'are', 'ten', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'none', 'would', 'have', 'provided', 'much', 'value', 'final', 'product', 'intriguing', 'casting', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'Putnam', 'first', 'wife', 'are', 'other', 'shorter', 'featurettes', 'focused', 'Earhart', 'plane', 'meticulous', 'recreation', 'period', 'aircraft', 'seven', 'vintage', 'newsreels']",N/A
1315295,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B0030E5NJ6,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 2]","AMELIA (Dir. Mira Nair, 2009, 111 minutes, based on the booksEast to the Dawn: The Life of Amelia Earhartby Susan Butler andThe Sound of Wings: The Life of Amelia Earhartby Mary S. Lovell) ~This film might as well have been a ""docudrama"" rather than a ""biopic"" (and it is based on a couple of somewhat 'cheesy' biographies). Excessively romantic views of Amelia Earhart's life are too dominant here. It is a delight to be transported back to her era, and to see such an able performance by Hillary Swank (I WILL NOT say it was Oscar-worthy, but no doubt she'll get the golden boy anyway).Interestingly I was privileged to watch PBS's 2000 documentaryThe Final Hours: Amelia Earhart's Last Flight, in which Swank voiced Earhart, mostly reading from Earhart's own letters and writings. A fascinating thing, which I think was neglected in the film, is that Amelia Earhart, once married, was legally known as Amelia Earhart Putnam and newsreels of the day called her that until she made sure her hubby's surname was dropped.But I commend Swank in FINAL HOURS for a brilliant vocal performance, even though with Earhart speaking in the newsreels along with Swank reading as Earhart, the difference between the two voices is startling. So much even for 'vocal reenactments'!Too much of this film is simple junior high school textbook stuff. Amelia's alleged incompetence as a pilot, the idea she was giving up flying after her round-the-world trip, even her private affairs...all by-the-book. There's no pizzazz here, no style, nothing like ""Ed Wood"" or even ""Tucker"".This thing falls flat.I for one did not know Amelia had an affair with Gene Vidal, had been like a mother to little Gore, Gene's son--nor did I care. Yet this film was heavy on the silly nonsense and light on the gritty facts. Any student of Earhart should get this film...any cinema buff ought to see it at least once, for it has some stylish, eye-popping moments such as her crash of the Electra.However, what angered me most about this film was the end. No-one except the most gullible blockhead will buy the ending, which clearly shows Earhart in desperation and Fred Noonan (Christopher Eccleston was badly sold short here) is almost convulsive with fear as they soar over the Old Specific.This is as by-the-book as it gets. Even the timeline format confused me slightly at first. I didn't want a film about what might have occurred to Earhart and Noonan, but I didn't want such a cut-and-dried ending either. The film was styled almost as a Hallmark movie.The canned-corn accents, including Swank losing it whenever she got emotional, and Gere sounding like FDR... too much for my ears. Gere couldn't even maintain his accent. People back then spoke much as we do today. Here these folks are killing themselves, trying to sound like the old MovieTone newsreels!By the way, Kerin McCue sounds exactly like Bob Gunton doing the newscast-voiceovers, and even these are a confusion because we never really know when they are faking a MovieTone newsreel or just doing some silly period narration. Shows what a general mess this film is, and that kind of thing is always the director's fault.Come to think of it, I would have preferred it as such. I will recommend a most satisfying and beautifully written little book that has fallen by the wayside:Lost Star : The Search for Amelia Earhart",3,Romantic view clouds horizon in this one...,1266192000,"02 15, 2010",2010,3353,"['AMELIA', 'Dir', 'Mira', 'Nair', '2009', '111', 'minutes', 'based', 'booksEast', 'Dawn', 'Life', 'Amelia', 'Earhartby', 'Susan', 'Butler', 'andThe', 'Sound', 'Wings', 'Life', 'Amelia', 'Earhartby', 'Mary', 'S.', 'Lovell', '~This', 'film', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'docudrama', 'rather', 'biopic', 'based', 'couple', 'somewhat', ""'cheesy"", 'biographies', 'Excessively', 'romantic', 'views', 'Amelia', 'Earhart', 'life', 'are', 'too', 'dominant', 'here', 'delight', 'be', 'transported', 'back', 'era', 'see', 'such', 'able', 'performance', 'Hillary', 'Swank', 'WILL', 'NOT', 'say', 'was', 'Oscar-worthy', 'doubt', ""'ll"", 'get', 'golden', 'boy', 'anyway', '.Interestingly', 'was', 'privileged', 'watch', 'PBS', '2000', 'documentaryThe', 'Final', 'Hours', 'Amelia', 'Earhart', 'Last', 'Flight', 'Swank', 'voiced', 'Earhart', 'mostly', 'reading', 'Earhart', 'own', 'letters', 'writings', 'fascinating', 'thing', 'think', 'was', 'neglected', 'film', 'Amelia', 'Earhart', 'once', 'married', 'was', 'legally', 'known', 'Amelia', 'Earhart', 'Putnam', 'newsreels', 'day', 'called', 'made', 'sure', 'hubby', 'surname', 'was', 'dropped.But', 'commend', 'Swank', 'FINAL', 'HOURS', 'brilliant', 'vocal', 'performance', 'even', 'Earhart', 'speaking', 'newsreels', 'Swank', 'reading', 'Earhart', 'difference', 'two', 'voices', 'startling', 'So', 'much', 'even', ""'vocal"", 'reenactments', 'Too', 'much', 'film', 'simple', 'junior', 'high', 'school', 'textbook', 'stuff', 'Amelia', 'alleged', 'incompetence', 'pilot', 'idea', 'was', 'giving', 'up', 'flying', 'round-the-world', 'trip', 'even', 'private', 'affairs', 'by-the-book', 'pizzazz', 'here', 'style', 'nothing', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'even', 'Tucker', '.This', 'thing', 'flat.I', 'one', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'Amelia', 'had', 'affair', 'Gene', 'Vidal', 'had', 'been', 'mother', 'little', 'Gore', 'Gene', 'son', 'did', 'care', 'film', 'was', 'heavy', 'silly', 'nonsense', 'light', 'gritty', 'facts', 'student', 'Earhart', 'should', 'get', 'film', 'cinema', 'buff', 'ought', 'see', 'least', 'once', 'stylish', 'eye-popping', 'moments', 'such', 'crash', 'Electra.However', 'what', 'angered', 'most', 'film', 'was', 'end', 'No-one', 'most', 'gullible', 'blockhead', 'will', 'buy', 'ending', 'clearly', 'Earhart', 'desperation', 'Fred', 'Noonan', 'Christopher', 'Eccleston', 'was', 'badly', 'sold', 'short', 'here', 'almost', 'convulsive', 'fear', 'soar', 'Old', 'Specific.This', 'as', 'by-the-book', 'Even', 'timeline', 'format', 'confused', 'slightly', 'first', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'film', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'occurred', 'Earhart', 'Noonan', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'such', 'cut-and-dried', 'ending', 'either', 'film', 'was', 'styled', 'almost', 'Hallmark', 'movie.The', 'canned-corn', 'accents', 'including', 'Swank', 'losing', 'whenever', 'got', 'emotional', 'Gere', 'sounding', 'FDR', 'too', 'much', 'ears', 'Gere', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'maintain', 'accent', 'People', 'back', 'then', 'spoke', 'much', 'do', 'today', 'Here', 'folks', 'are', 'killing', 'trying', 'sound', 'old', 'MovieTone', 'newsreels', 'way', 'Kerin', 'McCue', 'exactly', 'Bob', 'Gunton', 'doing', 'newscast-voiceovers', 'even', 'are', 'confusion', 'never', 'really', 'know', 'when', 'are', 'faking', 'MovieTone', 'newsreel', 'just', 'doing', 'silly', 'period', 'narration', 'what', 'general', 'mess', 'film', 'kind', 'thing', 'always', 'director', 'fault.Come', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'such', 'will', 'recommend', 'most', 'satisfying', 'beautifully', 'written', 'little', 'book', 'fallen', 'wayside', 'Lost', 'Star', 'Search', 'Amelia', 'Earhart']",N/A

Written by Ronald Bass and Ann Hamilton Phelan (with borrowed bits from biographies of Amelia Earhart by Susan Butler and by Mary S. Lovell) the script sounds like cut and pasted sayings and writings of Amelia rather than a well-developed story in the form of an interesting script.  Mira Nair directs with attention to period detail but seemingly little concern for shaping characters about whom we should care. The film plays like a docudrama for television with only a few moments that actually bring the viewer into the vaguely mysterious personality of Amelia Earhart.The film begins where it ends  -with scenes from the air as Amelia (Hilary Swank) is on her doomed attempt to circumnavigate the globe in 1937 at age 40.  She is accompanied by navigation expert Fred Noonan (Christopher Eccleston), passing notes to each other as they progress along the flight. The film cuts back and forth between 1928 when Amelia successfully flew across the Atlantic as the first woman passenger (the pilots are played well by Joe Anderson and Aaron Abrams), dawdles in the time of her success to marry her PR/publisher  man George Putnam (Richard Gere), back in the air for more scenes form the 1937 flight, then back on ground as she prepares for and successfully flies across the Atlantic to Ireland.  She meets and has an affair with Gene Vidal (Ewan McGregor), is constantly before the public selling lines of Amelia Earhart merchandise arranged by Putnam to finance her obsession with flying, and finally we see her board the Electra that she will successfully fly around a great portion of the air above the earth only to crash into the Pacific, never to be found.This seems as though it should be an interesting story for a film, but the writers and director and Swank make Earhart seem like a shy and flat personality despite her fame and the country's need for a hero during the Great Depression.  There are some fine moments that make the film worth seeing: the experience of Eleanor Roosevelt (Cherry Jones) flying with Amelia and the one sensitive scene when Amelia and Putnam share their love over a communications microphone just before the fatality of the flight.  The cast is filled with very fine actors - just poor material.  Who would have thought the life of such an interesting historic character could be so dull?

1315302,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B0030E5NJ6,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[2, 2]","""Amelia"" is not a documentary but dramatic excellence in telling the story of the emotion and energy in a quest for achievement. That impacts the life of one couple from 1928 to 1937. Amelia Earhart (Hilary Swank; Freedom Writers) has a dream, a goal, a focus, a destiny. George Putnam (Richard Gere; Nights in Rodanthe & Shall we Dance) strives a decade toward her quests. Touching, and exhilarating, but not really a romance. More like historical relationship.The movie begins June 1, 1937, with wonderful orchestra music blending into the magical set of the thirties. Immediately were flown back to 1928 in this portrayal of emotion and personal challenge, written through the inspiration of TWO books: ""The sound of Wings,"" Mary S. Lovell & ""East of the Dawn"" by Susan Butler. It's not about depicting the history of Earhart's flight achievements; freedom for women [although it does a fine job there]; or the romantic life she had. It is Amelia's interaction of feminine spirit and exuberance for flying, against her disdain for publicity and financing that necessarily accompanied that, which lifts-off this story into stardom. Flying was often more important than her marriage relationship. What a top-flight job Swank did as Amelia, capturing her aerial soul.Gere did an equally masterful job as Putnam, serving as Amelia's financial support and eventually onward to that of a mate wanting to see his spouse fulfill HER dreams.  Each nuanced step of the way, in this 9-year period movie time span, is powerfully portrayed by Gere through his acceptance of non-conventional vows to his escalating fear of losing Amelia in her each new higher-achieving flight.So why is a movie with minimal action, no animation, & period history worthy of 5 stars today? Simply the marvelous subtle changes of human emotion portrayed by the lead acting couple. Very true to life, which is what ""acting"" should be based upon, not theatrical gimmicks.

1315305,A3ML2HRDE3PY5I,B0030E5NJ6,Hikari,"[6, 9]","What is truly remarkable about this 'dramatic biopic' about the trailblazing proto-feminist icon and daring aviatrix Amelia Earhart is just how dramatic and engaging it isn't.  It's two interminable hours of one clunky set piece after another, as Hilary Swank and Richard Gere traipse through a parade of Depression-era fashions intermixed with bouts of deadly earnest and soul-killing dialogue.  Earhart was a fascinating and exceptionally lively subject, but not here.  How exactly did it go so wrong?  With a top-drawer cast and obviously no expense spared on the production design, it still manages to be a complete miss.  Swank is a stunning doppelganger for Amelia, and there are some breathtaking aerial shots, but even so, I cannot muster even two stars for the effort.  I didn't know anything about Earhart's life, and after investing two hours in a movie entirely devoted to her, I feel like I should be further along in my knowledge.  Swank looks fetching in Amelia's aviatrix garb, but that's about as deep as this goes.  Having no idea how the real Amelia sounded, I can't tell if Swank's nasally, Katherine Hepburnesque Atlantic diction is appropriate or merely a mannered affectation, but it sure doesn't sound like a gal from Kansas to me.  Earhart was a much-beloved and inspirational figure, but as portrayed by Swank the appeal does not translate.  Earhart comes across as a superficial, self-absorbed harpy and a rather inept pilot, who is casually cruel to her adoring husband George Putnam (Gere) with her infidelities and her insistence that he not tie her down into anything as confining and dull as matrimony.  Perhaps these were Earhart's true sentiments, but I can't help thinking she expressed them with more spirit and charm than is evidenced here.The biopic is a landmine-filled genre--what to include, what to leave out?  Any life, even one as brief as Earhart's, will have too much incident to be included in one two-hour film; director Mira Nair has a painterly eye for the breathtaking shot, but lacks the same discipline with her pacing or editorial choices.  Her film is bogged down in the same slavish devotion to superficial detail that rendered Richard Attenborough's ""Chaplin"" ultimately bloodless . . .but Attenborough was depicting a life that endured more than twice as long as Earhart's, who perished at age 40 along with navigator Fred Noonan (Christopher Eccleston in the film) when their plane went down over the Pacific on July 2, 1937.  So many of Earhart's most notable achievements were completed far above the earth alone, or with few witnesses who no longer survive, that Nair is hindered by having to recreate events that no one living can know about.  And, as it turns out, while the views from the sky are spectacular, sitting in a cockpit flying a plane is not inherently full of dramtic interest.  Swank has little to do during those scenes other than squint through the windscreen with a look of consternation on her overly prominent face.  Thus, the bulk of the 'action' takes place on the ground, where it is leaden and earthbound.  Nair would have done better to focus on Earhart's groundbreaking role as a corporate spokesperson for aviation.  She and Putnam were criticized for money-grubbing by promoting so many products for cash, but flying is an expensive endeavor, and it was necessary.  The age of commercial aviation had not yet been ushered in, and flyers were dependent upon wealthy patrons or corporate donations to provide the equipment.  This tension between the freedom flight offered, and the more prosaic realities of having to pay for it was a large feature of Earhart's life not exploited by this film.  As one of the first celebrity phenomenons in her field (surpassed only by Charles Lindbergh), Amelia was unique and this angle could have been played up more.  Swank has excelled at playing controversial feminist figures, and Amelia should have been one to really sink her sizable teeth into . . but the script lets her down, as it does the rest of the cast, who, with the exception of Gere, have roles that are so minimal as to be considered near-cameos.  McGregor and Eccleston, two of our finest character actors are stars in their own rights, and should have said a resounding ""No"" to appearing in this tedious pastiche.  As you should to investing 2 hours of your time in this resounding disappointment.

1315311,A3BRHTAUBZUGK8,B0030E5NJ6,"Jym Cherry ""Writing Under The Influence of Ro...","[5, 6]","Amelia is a pretty standard issue bio-pic. The story is told as Amelia makes the last journey with Fred Noonan to find Howland Island. Amelia Earhart was a pioneer of aviation when flying was still dangerous, when airplanes crumpled like kites, and only to be undertaken by adventurous men. Although, for a while women's  aviation was competitive with men's aviation, since engines and machines even up the playing field.The story is pretty much about the adult Amelia Earhart (Hilary Swank), although we're shown a young Amelia become enthralled with flying upon seeing her first barnstormer. Earhart's accomplishments are pretty much hit on in this film. The first woman to fly across the Atlantic, as a passenger, winning a cross country air race, her meeting with and falling in love with G.P. Putnam (Richard Gere) who made her a celebrity. The film makes it clear Earhart was uncomfortable with that celebrity endorsing a cigarette brand when she didn't smoke, luggage, a clothes line, a waffle iron, all that was missing was a perfume. It's clear that Earhart was not only a pioneer in the air but in the area of celebrity endorsements, and that status chaffed at her. In her eyes, her accomplishments were diminished by having to be only a passenger on that first trans-Atlantic flight. Putnam made a her feel like a ""white horse jumping through hoops"" but rationalized that it was necessary to fund her wanderlust of the skies.Also detailed is her setting up with Gene Vidal (Ewan McGregor) the first airline shuttle within the United States, again, for this business venture Earhart allows herself to be used as a figurehead to attract business for Vidal's airline. Earhart also meets Vidal's son the future writer Gore Vidal, who even at a young age it seems was proposing alternative lifestyles.Earhart wanted to erase all doubts about skills as an aviator (aviatrix in the parlance of the day), that she was more ambition than accomplishment, and undertakes to circumnavigate the globe, which no man had done. Did Earhart undertake this expedition because she was insecure about the circumstances of previous accomplishements?The acting by all the principals is what you would expect of actors of this caliber, there's nothing flashy here, but then the script doesn't really call for it until the end with Earhart and Putnam promising to see each other soon.Of course we all know the outcome of that last flight and the speculation and mystery it's generated since, but this movie doesn't rise up to the level of the mystery or its stars. 3.5 stars",3,Amelia Went Where No Man Had Gone Before,1256256000,"10 23, 2009",2009,2561,"['Amelia', 'pretty', 'standard', 'issue', 'bio-pic', 'story', 'told', 'Amelia', 'last', 'journey', 'Fred', 'Noonan', 'find', 'Howland', 'Island', 'Amelia', 'Earhart', 'was', 'pioneer', 'aviation', 'when', 'flying', 'was', 'still', 'dangerous', 'when', 'airplanes', 'crumpled', 'kites', 'only', 'be', 'undertaken', 'adventurous', 'men', 'while', 'women', 'aviation', 'was', 'competitive', 'men', 'aviation', 'engines', 'machines', 'even', 'playing', 'field.The', 'story', 'pretty', 'much', 'adult', 'Amelia', 'Earhart', 'Hilary', 'Swank', ""'re"", 'shown', 'young', 'Amelia', 'become', 'enthralled', 'flying', 'seeing', 'first', 'barnstormer', 'Earhart', 'accomplishments', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'hit', 'film', 'first', 'woman', 'fly', 'Atlantic', 'passenger', 'winning', 'cross', 'country', 'air', 'race', 'meeting', 'falling', 'love', 'G.P', 'Putnam', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'who', 'made', 'celebrity', 'film', 'clear', 'Earhart', 'was', 'uncomfortable', 'celebrity', 'endorsing', 'cigarette', 'brand', 'when', 'did', ""n't"", 'smoke', 'luggage', 'clothes', 'line', 'waffle', 'iron', 'was', 'missing', 'was', 'perfume', 'clear', 'Earhart', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'pioneer', 'air', 'area', 'celebrity', 'endorsements', 'status', 'chaffed', 'eyes', 'accomplishments', 'were', 'diminished', 'having', 'be', 'only', 'passenger', 'first', 'trans-Atlantic', 'flight', 'Putnam', 'made', 'feel', 'white', 'horse', 'jumping', 'hoops', 'rationalized', 'was', 'necessary', 'fund', 'wanderlust', 'skies.Also', 'detailed', 'setting', 'up', 'Gene', 'Vidal', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'first', 'airline', 'shuttle', 'United', 'States', 'again', 'business', 'venture', 'Earhart', 'be', 'used', 'figurehead', 'attract', 'business', 'Vidal', 'airline', 'Earhart', 'also', 'Vidal', 'son', 'future', 'writer', 'Gore', 'Vidal', 'who', 'even', 'young', 'age', 'was', 'proposing', 'alternative', 'lifestyles.Earhart', 'wanted', 'erase', 'doubts', 'about', 'skills', 'aviator', 'aviatrix', 'parlance', 'day', 'was', 'more', 'ambition', 'accomplishment', 'undertakes', 'circumnavigate', 'globe', 'man', 'had', 'done', 'Did', 'Earhart', 'undertake', 'expedition', 'was', 'insecure', 'circumstances', 'previous', 'accomplishements', 'acting', 'principals', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'actors', 'caliber', 'nothing', 'flashy', 'here', 'then', 'script', ""n't"", 'really', 'call', 'end', 'Earhart', 'Putnam', 'promising', 'see', 'other', 'soon.Of', 'course', 'know', 'outcome', 'last', 'flight', 'speculation', 'mystery', 'generated', 'movie', ""n't"", 'rise', 'up', 'level', 'mystery', 'stars', '3.5', 'stars']",N/A

1315318,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B0030E5NJ6,Mark Turner,"[2, 3]","It seems these days that we rarely get a release that takes a real life figure and gives them whole biopic treatment. When it happens, it can be a joy or a film that deserves disgust. The worst are the ones that take a life and turn it into a blatant political statement or cause. The best are the ones that just let us enjoy the life of the person whose life we get a somewhat skewed look at. And then there are movies like AMELIA that lean towards the last with just a touch of the first.Hillary Swank stars as Amelia Earhart, the flying aviatrix whose life captivated a nation when the country was down in the dumps. Earhart's adventures captured the hearts and minds of not just young boys but of young girls as well. She was a pioneer in more ways than one, not only as a flyer but as a woman who was able to bypass the norms of the time.The film opens with Earhart about to take off on her last voyage to be the first person to circle the globe. As she prepares to leave, we see a moment between Earhart and her husband, George Putnam (Richard Gere). From here the film moves on to tell her story in flashback, from her early days in Kansas glimpsing her first plane to the story of that last fateful trip.Much of her tale is passed by taking us straight to that which made her famous, her flying. She approaches publisher Putnam about making the trip across the Atlantic, only done so far by Charles Lindbergh. Chosen from many who applied for the position, Amelia is selected, but not to actually pilot the plane, just to command it. Through sheer determination and taking control of the crew, Amelia does accomplish her goal.Along the way in her efforts to fly more and advance avionics, Earhart finds time to fall in love with Putnam. Theirs was a romance unlike most in that Earhart, while loving Putnam, doesn't want to find herself tied to him should their lives take different courses. But fall in love they do and soon wed.Earhart continues to find more records to break and more standards to challenge. She creates an air race for women. She crosses the country and flies places even many men didn't go. And she becomes a spokesperson for the field of flying as well as numerous products her name becomes attached to, all in an effort to raise money to allow her to fly.Earhart also finds herself attracted to another aviation founder, Gene Vidal (Ewan McGregor). The pair is first attracted at a party where George witnesses their attraction and feels threatened. It progresses through the film until they do become an item. When George refuses to be tossed aside, the affair is ended much to Vidal's disappointment. But the real love of Amelia's life according to this film is George.Towards the last portion of the film, Amelia prepares for her round the world trip. A first failure heading west leads to a rethinking of the trip. Her second attempt sends her east as she crosses the Atlantic once again and continues around the world. The final portion of her trip had her leaving New Guinea and heading towards the small Howland Island. The coast guard ship the Itasca attempts contact with her and does so off and on, but the end result is well known.This story has an ending that everyone is well aware of, but the film is so well made that you find yourself hoping for, expecting even, a different ending. It is well crafted with images that propel the viewer onto the wings of an airplane to get a glimpse at the world from far above, perhaps the same glimpse that Earhart experienced over similar terrain.But at the center of the film, apart from the flying aspects and story of celebrity, lies the romance between Earhart and Putnam. What started as a business deal to write a book turned into a respect, admiration and support of a woman and her dream based on love. Is this the reality of their lives? I don't honestly know. But from this film one would have to believe so.The performances by the leads are well done. Swank does a fine job, adopting the look, the walk and the subtle lilt of accent that Earhart displayed in countless news reels. Gere does an admirable job in not taking center stage, not upstaging Swank, but supporting her character much as the real Putnam supported Earhart. The two compliment each other well here.It's rare we have biopics these days without the worst the people they're telling us about on display in full fledged salacious glory. It's nice to see a well deserved hero get their tale told without graphic details. AMELIA is an uplifting film that deserves to be watched.One of the best extras included here are the Movietone news clips of the real Amelia Earhart. Having the chance to see side by side, in a way, Swank's performance with the real thing made for interesting viewing.",4,HIGH FLYING ADVENTURESS,1265673600,"02 9, 2010",2010,4750,"['days', 'rarely', 'get', 'release', 'real', 'life', 'figure', 'whole', 'biopic', 'treatment', 'When', 'can', 'be', 'joy', 'film', 'disgust', 'worst', 'are', 'ones', 'take', 'life', 'turn', 'blatant', 'political', 'statement', 'cause', 'best', 'are', 'ones', 'just', 'let', 'enjoy', 'life', 'person', 'life', 'get', 'somewhat', 'skewed', 'look', 'then', 'are', 'movies', 'AMELIA', 'lean', 'last', 'just', 'touch', 'first.Hillary', 'Swank', 'stars', 'Amelia', 'Earhart', 'flying', 'aviatrix', 'life', 'captivated', 'nation', 'when', 'country', 'was', 'down', 'dumps', 'Earhart', 'adventures', 'captured', 'hearts', 'minds', 'not', 'just', 'young', 'boys', 'young', 'girls', 'well', 'was', 'pioneer', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'not', 'only', 'flyer', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'able', 'bypass', 'norms', 'time.The', 'film', 'Earhart', 'take', 'off', 'last', 'voyage', 'be', 'first', 'person', 'circle', 'globe', 'leave', 'see', 'moment', 'Earhart', 'husband', 'George', 'Putnam', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'here', 'film', 'moves', 'tell', 'story', 'flashback', 'early', 'days', 'Kansas', 'glimpsing', 'first', 'plane', 'story', 'last', 'fateful', 'trip.Much', 'tale', 'passed', 'taking', 'straight', 'made', 'famous', 'flying', 'publisher', 'Putnam', 'making', 'trip', 'Atlantic', 'only', 'done', 'so', 'far', 'Charles', 'Lindbergh', 'Chosen', 'many', 'who', 'applied', 'position', 'Amelia', 'selected', 'not', 'actually', 'pilot', 'plane', 'just', 'command', 'sheer', 'determination', 'taking', 'control', 'crew', 'Amelia', 'accomplish', 'goal.Along', 'way', 'efforts', 'fly', 'more', 'advance', 'avionics', 'Earhart', 'time', 'fall', 'love', 'Putnam', 'Theirs', 'was', 'romance', 'most', 'Earhart', 'loving', 'Putnam', ""n't"", 'want', 'find', 'tied', 'should', 'lives', 'take', 'different', 'courses', 'fall', 'love', 'do', 'soon', 'wed.Earhart', 'find', 'more', 'records', 'break', 'more', 'standards', 'challenge', 'air', 'race', 'women', 'country', 'flies', 'places', 'even', 'many', 'men', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'spokesperson', 'field', 'flying', 'as', 'well', 'numerous', 'products', 'name', 'attached', 'effort', 'raise', 'money', 'allow', 'fly.Earhart', 'also', 'attracted', 'aviation', 'founder', 'Gene', 'Vidal', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'pair', 'first', 'attracted', 'party', 'where', 'George', 'attraction', 'feels', 'threatened', 'film', 'do', 'become', 'item', 'When', 'George', 'be', 'tossed', 'aside', 'affair', 'ended', 'much', 'Vidal', 'disappointment', 'real', 'love', 'Amelia', 'life', 'according', 'film', 'George.Towards', 'last', 'portion', 'film', 'Amelia', 'round', 'world', 'trip', 'first', 'failure', 'heading', 'west', 'leads', 'rethinking', 'trip', 'second', 'attempt', 'east', 'Atlantic', 'once', 'again', 'world', 'final', 'portion', 'trip', 'had', 'leaving', 'New', 'Guinea', 'heading', 'small', 'Howland', 'Island', 'coast', 'guard', 'ship', 'Itasca', 'attempts', 'contact', 'so', 'off', 'end', 'result', 'well', 'known.This', 'story', 'ending', 'everyone', 'well', 'aware', 'film', 'so', 'well', 'made', 'find', 'hoping', 'expecting', 'even', 'different', 'ending', 'well', 'crafted', 'images', 'propel', 'viewer', 'wings', 'airplane', 'get', 'glimpse', 'world', 'far', 'perhaps', 'same', 'glimpse', 'Earhart', 'experienced', 'similar', 'terrain.But', 'center', 'film', 'apart', 'flying', 'aspects', 'story', 'celebrity', 'romance', 'Earhart', 'Putnam', 'What', 'started', 'business', 'deal', 'write', 'book', 'turned', 'respect', 'admiration', 'support', 'woman', 'dream', 'based', 'love', 'reality', 'lives', 'do', ""n't"", 'honestly', 'know', 'film', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'so.The', 'performances', 'leads', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'Swank', 'fine', 'job', 'adopting', 'look', 'walk', 'subtle', 'lilt', 'accent', 'Earhart', 'displayed', 'countless', 'news', 'reels', 'Gere', 'admirable', 'job', 'not', 'taking', 'center', 'stage', 'not', 'upstaging', 'Swank', 'supporting', 'character', 'much', 'real', 'Putnam', 'supported', 'Earhart', 'two', 'compliment', 'other', 'well', 'here.It', 'rare', 'have', 'biopics', 'days', 'worst', 'people', ""'re"", 'telling', 'display', 'full', 'fledged', 'salacious', 'glory', 'nice', 'see', 'well', 'deserved', 'hero', 'get', 'tale', 'told', 'graphic', 'details', 'AMELIA', 'uplifting', 'film', 'be', 'watched.One', 'best', 'extras', 'included', 'here', 'are', 'Movietone', 'news', 'clips', 'real', 'Amelia', 'Earhart', 'Having', 'chance', 'see', 'side', 'side', 'way', 'Swank', 'performance', 'real', 'thing', 'made', 'interesting', 'viewing']",N/A
1315319,A1CDNTB7377YH2,B0030E5NJ6,Michael A. Newman,"[0, 0]","I was very disappointed with this film.  It had a good cast (Swank and Gere) and I generally like these biopics (ex. The Aviator with Leonardo DiCapprio).  I found most of this movie incredibly boring and very little insight was presented about Amelia the person.  Yes, she has a strange relationship with her promoter/husband and an even stranger one with a married flying instructor (Ian McGregor) and we do briefly see her fascination with flying (about 30 seconds) as a girl growing up in Kansas.  Other than that the actual insight is virtually non-existant.Swank does look as heck of a lot better than the actual Amelia (we see actual footage of the real Amelia at the end of the film) but I felt her performance to be incredibly weak and her accent was annoying.  She would have been more effective using her own accent (I remember DeNiro successfully playing a Spanish noble in The Mission with his own Brooklyn accent) and at times Gere spoke so low that I needed to rewind the DVD several times to understand what he was saying.There is one good scene where Amelia is making a flight as a ""passenger"" from New Foundland to Ireland and the plane drops causing first the navigator then Amelia to almost fall out of the plan.  There was also some controversy as Gere did not permit Amelia to actually fly the plane in that first cross-Atlantic crossing as well as Gere telling another female pilot to let Amelia win a flying race.

But when I opened my newspaper On tha October morning back in 2009 I actually spotted a film that I was interested in seeing.  ""Amelia"" is a biographical motion picture that dramatizes the life of the legendary female aviator Amelia Earhart.  Since I am a huge history buff I simply could not resist.Now if you are looking non-stop action, strong charactors and breathtaking special effects then I suspect that ""Amelia"" will probably not be your cup of tea.  Director Mira Nair has given us a film that more closely resembles the films of the 1940's and 1950's.  Amelia Earhart (Hilary Swank) was a spirited young woman when she arrived in New York to meet with book publisher George Putman (Richard Gere) to discuss her possible participation in a trans-Atlantic flight.  Putnam was offering her a book deal and fame but what the public did not know was that Amelia was to be nothing more than an observer on that first flight across the Atlantic. This revelation came as a complete surprise to me as well.  Nevertheless Amelia Earhart would become an overnight sensation.  Meanwhile, George Putman had fallen head over heels for the pretty young farm girl from Kansas.  Amelia had little interest in being tied down but Putnam's persistance finally won the day.  The couple was married in 1931.  Shortly thereafter Amelia would meet up with a dashing young man who shared her love of flying.  Gene Vidal (Evan McGregor) would become Amelia's soul mate resulting in a very uncomfortable triangle for a period of time.But there was certainly no force on earth that was going to keep Amelia grounded.  In 1932, a mere five years after Charles Lindbugh turned the trick,  Amelia Earhart completed the first successful trans-Atlantic solo flight by a woman. Then in 1935, Earhart became the first person ever to fly from Hawaii to California.  Now Amelia wanted to reach for the golden ring.  She wanted to be the first person in history to fly all the way around the globe.  There were so many obstacles to be overcome but Amelia was bound and determined.  ""Amelia"" does an outstanding job of chronicling the events of that final flight, most particularly during those last tensioned filled hours.  Her husband George and the entire nation anxiously awaited word of her fate.When all is said and done I really did like ""Amelia"".  While this is not a great film I do not take as dim a view of it as many of the critics.  I suspect that most of these critics are a good deal younger than I am.  I believe that older audiences will flock to ""Amelia"" since there are very few films that appeal to this demographic these days.  Also, given the historical nature of the film I believe it will be quite successful when it is released on DVD.  In my view this one certainly rates as a solid +3 offering.  Nothing wrong with that.

It did not understand why they chose what they chose to include in the movie, leads me to believe they left out a whole bunch of other things.

It was at times that America was battling great depression and women were still battling for their right in a male structured society.  Certainly for feminists, Amelia is important because she never compromised her personal or professional life and made sure that other women managed to have same opportunities in the future.This film on the other hand, focuses very much on her personal life and her marriage with publisher George Putnam and later dashing Eugene Vidal.  Knowing that Richard Gere plays her devoted and understanding husband George Putnam only re-inforces the idea of a sappy romance.  I never felt that Amelia's relationship with Eugene Vidal was fully explored, because I do feel that their relationship was beyong being just a temporary escape or a fling for either one of them.In any case, I belong to post-feminist era and I do not buy the idea of the ""great sisterhood"" amongst women.

1315334,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0030E5NJ6,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 3]","**1/2Even two-time Oscar winner Hilary Swank can't elevate ""Amelia"" much above the level of the standard great-person-of-history biopic.  Amelia Earhart was, of course, the pioneer aviator who became the first woman to fly across the Atlantic, and who, in 1937, met a tragic fate when she and her navigator Fred Noonan (Christopher Eccleston) disappeared over the Pacific in a failed attempt to be the first pilot to ever circumnavigate the globe.Swank certainly looks the part of the famed flyer, and she has the voice and mannerisms down pat as well.  The problem is that the screenplay by Ronald Bass and Anna Hamilton Phelan (from the novels ""East to the Dawn"" and ""The Sound of Wings"") doesn't provide the actress with the opportunity to delve much beneath the surface of the character.  For all Swank's efforts at mimicry, Earhart stubbornly remains a cardboard cutout of a woman who refused to allow the society around her to dictate what she, or any woman for that matter, could and could not do, and who lived life to the fullest, even though she wound up paying the ultimate price for it.Even her long-term relationship with and eventual marriage to book publisher George Putnam (Richard Gere) and her brief dalliance with pilot and future Federal Aviation administrator Gene Vidal (Ewan McGregor) come across as standard-issue melodrama, executed without flair or passion.The movie is at its most interesting when it's concentrating on the early history of aviation and the part Earhart herself played in it.  A brief scene in which Earhart takes Eleanor Roosevelt on a night-flight over Washington D.C. is a rare moment when the movie itself actually manages to soar above the earthbound histrionics. And the flight scenes themselves are, as one would expect, visually stimulating and emotionally captivating.But low-wattage performances, pedestrian direction (a real shock coming from the highly gifted Mira Nair) and conventional storytelling (it's all done in the form of a huge book-ended flashback, of course) keep ""Amelia"" from truly taking flight.",2,Fails to engage,1326153600,"01 10, 2012",2012,2066,"['**1/2Even', 'two-time', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'ca', ""n't"", 'elevate', 'Amelia', 'much', 'level', 'standard', 'great-person-of-history', 'biopic', 'Amelia', 'Earhart', 'was', 'course', 'pioneer', 'aviator', 'who', 'became', 'first', 'woman', 'fly', 'Atlantic', 'who', '1937', 'met', 'tragic', 'fate', 'when', 'navigator', 'Fred', 'Noonan', 'Christopher', 'Eccleston', 'disappeared', 'Pacific', 'failed', 'attempt', 'be', 'first', 'pilot', 'ever', 'circumnavigate', 'globe.Swank', 'certainly', 'part', 'famed', 'flyer', 'voice', 'mannerisms', 'down', 'pat', 'as', 'well', 'problem', 'screenplay', 'Ronald', 'Bass', 'Anna', 'Hamilton', 'Phelan', 'novels', 'East', 'Dawn', 'Sound', 'Wings', ""n't"", 'provide', 'actress', 'opportunity', 'delve', 'much', 'surface', 'character', 'Swank', 'efforts', 'mimicry', 'Earhart', 'stubbornly', 'cardboard', 'cutout', 'woman', 'who', 'refused', 'allow', 'society', 'dictate', 'what', 'woman', 'matter', 'could', 'could', 'not', 'do', 'who', 'lived', 'life', 'fullest', 'even', 'wound', 'up', 'paying', 'ultimate', 'price', 'it.Even', 'long-term', 'relationship', 'eventual', 'marriage', 'book', 'publisher', 'George', 'Putnam', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'brief', 'dalliance', 'pilot', 'future', 'Federal', 'Aviation', 'administrator', 'Gene', 'Vidal', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'come', 'standard-issue', 'melodrama', 'executed', 'flair', 'passion.The', 'movie', 'most', 'interesting', 'when', 'concentrating', 'early', 'history', 'aviation', 'part', 'Earhart', 'played', 'brief', 'scene', 'Earhart', 'Eleanor', 'Roosevelt', 'night-flight', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'rare', 'moment', 'when', 'movie', 'actually', 'soar', 'earthbound', 'histrionics', 'flight', 'scenes', 'are', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'visually', 'stimulating', 'emotionally', 'captivating.But', 'low-wattage', 'performances', 'pedestrian', 'direction', 'real', 'shock', 'coming', 'highly', 'gifted', 'Mira', 'Nair', 'conventional', 'storytelling', 'done', 'form', 'huge', 'book-ended', 'flashback', 'course', 'keep', 'Amelia', 'truly', 'taking', 'flight']",N/A

She glows with intelligent, unfailing good humor.The bonus materials on the DVD are also well worth watching. They include some 1930's Movietone news reels, with Lowell Thomas reporting Earhart's latest triumph or trouble. There is also a fairly long list of deleted scenes, showing that the movie had originally included a whole subplot about Putnam's first wife (played by Virginia Madsen).

Mira Nair has directed a routine biopic, when her subject calls for far more.  Earhart was a feminist, a flier, a worldwide celebrity, an author, and a self-promoter, but the movie portrays her life in ho-hum, linear fashion.

1315348,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B0030E5NJ6,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[0, 1]","""Amelia"", the new film from director Mira Nair, starring Hillary Swank as the famed female aviator and Richard Gere as her lifelong lover, G.P. Putnam, is a beautiful film to look at. All of the physical details seem to have been recreated to the smallest detail. But it lacks any storytelling zing and quickly settles into fairly standard biopic mode.As Amelia Earhart (Swank, who bears a remarkable resemblance) makes her flight around the world with her navigator, Fred Noonan (Christopher Eccleston, ""Jude"", BBC's ""Doctor Who""), she remembers back to her start and to various key moments in her life. G.P. Putnam (Gere) has just published an autobiography of Lindbergh (who he doesn't like) and is trying to make lightning strike twice. One of his wealthy socialite friends has just purchased a plane and wants G.P. to find the ""first woman to cross the Atlantic"". Amelia has a lifelong desire to fly prompting her to apply for the position. She jumps at the chance even though it is little more than a charade. Putnam has hired a crew and Earhart will be the ""Commander"", while the two men actually fly the plane. When they arrive in Europe, Earhart becomes a celebrity. Putnam is only too eager to capitalize but he also finds he likes Amelia's pluck. They become lovers and Putnam wants her to marry him; she is honest with Putnam because she doesn't want to hurt him, she is too much of a free spirit; she wants adventure and doesn't want to be tied down. Eventually, she decides to do the actual flight, alone, to earn the title she already has. Then she makes plans for longer, more dangerous trips. Along the way, she meets Gene Vidal (Ewan McGregor), the father of a young boy named Gore (who would grow up to become a famous author) and they have an affair. Then, while making the last leg of her journey around the world, something happens and a mystery begins.Mira Nair, the director of such films as ""Mississippi Mermaid"" and ""Monsoon Wedding"" would seem like a great choice to helm this biopic. A female director used to making largely independent films (if I'm not mistaken, this may be her first big budget film) she seems like a natural fit to tell the story of this very independent woman, an adventurer, who 'defied the odds"". But Nair does a strange thing and creates a very straightforward biopic, beautiful to look at but very straightforward and even a little boring.Because ""Amelia"" is so straightforward, it almost seems like a series of vignettes designed to capture the buzzwords that might describe Amelia Earhart. I am actually most disappointed with the work of Ron Bass, the screenwriter. Bass is a well-known and very successful screenwriter, the writer of films like ""Rainman"" and ""The Joy Luck Club"", so when you go to a film like ""Amelia"", you expect to learn a little something about the character, to peel back some of the layers and reveal their inner workings. But because everything is so straightforward, it almost seems like he is trying to provide illustrations for a Cliff Notes version of the aviator's life. She is a ""woman who defied the odds"", so we watch her plan exceedingly more difficult and dangerous flights. As she accomplishes each one, she receives acclaim and notice, but the film seems to downplay most of this. Amelia is also a ""free spirit"", so she eventually decides to marry G.P. but only after extracting a promise that they both can follow their heart where it leads them. These are all on the surface and don't help us get to the inner workings of the character. We could all learn this from reading a few articles about Amelia on the internet. Why don't we ever learn why she has such an overriding desire to fly? It isn't because she wants fame. But why?It doesn't help that the film is framed by showing us moments of the fateful flight around the world. An ominous declaration foreshadows the most dangerous leg, but because we are watching the rest of her life, in more or less chronological order, as she remembers back during this flight, the film seems episodic. It feels like so much time is allocated for moment A. Check, move on. So much time is allocated for moment B. Check, move on. And so forth.Hilary Swank is a very good as Amelia. Her physical resemblance is amazing and she seems to be channeling the spirit of Katherine Hepburn (who, when young, also resembled Earhart). She brings a certain amount of 'daring-do' to the role and this fits nicely. But I think she is really short changed by the director and her screenplay. Since neither really allows her to get to the bottom of who Earhart really was, she can't. She gives life to some of the romantic entanglements but that is about it. We never really get a feel for why she dislikes the fame and promotion side of what she becomes. We never really get a feel for why she wants to fly beyond the brief shot of a young Amelia running through a field, her hand slicing through the air (a shot so stereotypical, I could go on for pages about this moment alone).Richard Gere is okay as her lover, the publisher G. P. Putnam. He quickly gets across the various aspects of his character (a mover and shaker, ready and willing for the next deal, eager to create buzz about everything he is involved in) and then spends the rest of the film trying to keep Amelia in check. Later, as she moves on to Vidal, he spends what seems like an enormous amount of screen time looking forlorn and crying.I think it is time for Gere to hang up this type of role. He seems to have a lock playing the older lover of a younger woman and always playing the roles as very emotional and frequently crying. I'm all for male actors showing emotion, but he plays the older lover of younger women far too often. It is almost as bad as Woody Allen consistently casting the hottest young actress in Hollywood as his lover in every film. Granted, there is less of a generational gap between Gere and most of his co-stars, but it is still creepy. Almost as though he is consistently trying to relive his glory days as the hot young lead of such films as ""An Officer and a Gentlemen"" or ""American Gigolo"". For me, the real turning point was in ""Unfaithful"", when Gere played the faithful husband to Diane Lane and she has an affair with Olivier Martinez. Gere is in another generation than Lane, who is herself in another generation than Martinez.Ewan McGregor is okay as Vidal. We don't really get a sense of who he is or why he is interested in Earhart, but he shows a certain amount of pluck. I'm not sure why, but every time he is on screen, he is interesting to watch, perhaps because we know very little about him and the mystery keeps us guessing and watching. I also find it strange that McGregor isn't even listed as one of the stars of the film. Every trailer and television ad shows all three, but only mentions Swank and Gere by name.I think ""Amelia"" is too conventional for its own good and because of this will quickly be forgotten. Considering the amount of box office and buzz it is creating, I think the film may already be forgotten.Now which film was I talking about again?",3,"""Amelia"" Goes Where Every Other Biopic Has Gone

1315349,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0030E5NJ6,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 3]","I tried to like ""Amelia."" The life story of the legendary American aviatrix Amelia Earhart is a fascinating one, even without the mystery surrounding her world flight in 1937. A great story is here, but no one seems to know how to tell it. With Hilary Swank's strong performance as Amelia Earhart, the film flies, but somehow it does not soar.The 111-minute film is rushed, trying to cover so many aspects of Amelia Earhart - her romances, ambitions, achievements and the final flight - but the film's descriptions of them are all superficial. Her determination to fly is shown, but not her spirit as a pioneering pilot. Her successful cross-Atlantic flight is told, but that epoch-making event, which should be more inspirational, is not moving as drama or intense as action enough, because the aviation sequence lacks the details (or the ""build-up"") that is necessary to explain the greatness of her accomplishment. In short, the film's story looks cursory, while real Amelia Earhart's life was full of extraordinary episodes.Richard Gere plays George P. Putnam, a successful publisher and promoter, who later married America Earhart. The film suggests conflicts in their relationships, but instead of exploring the reasons behind them, director Mira Nair hurries to the next scene. Ewan McGregor is totally wasted as Gene Vidal (father of author Gore), so is Mia Wasikowska as Elinor Smith.The flying sequences are beautifully done (though special effects need improvement), and the story is great, though it deserves a better treatment.",3,"(2.5 STARS) Suffers from Rushed Pace; Nice Flying Sequences, Though",1291161600,"12 1, 2010",2010,1540,"['tried', 'like', 'Amelia', 'life', 'story', 'legendary', 'American', 'aviatrix', 'Amelia', 'Earhart', 'fascinating', 'one', 'even', 'mystery', 'surrounding', 'world', 'flight', '1937', 'great', 'story', 'here', 'one', 'know', 'how', 'tell', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'strong', 'performance', 'Amelia', 'Earhart', 'film', 'flies', 'somehow', 'not', 'soar.The', '111-minute', 'film', 'rushed', 'trying', 'cover', 'so', 'many', 'aspects', 'Amelia', 'Earhart', 'romances', 'ambitions', 'achievements', 'final', 'flight', 'film', 'descriptions', 'are', 'superficial', 'determination', 'fly', 'shown', 'not', 'spirit', 'pioneering', 'pilot', 'successful', 'cross-Atlantic', 'flight', 'told', 'epoch-making', 'event', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'inspirational', 'not', 'moving', 'drama', 'intense', 'action', 'enough', 'aviation', 'sequence', 'details', 'build-up', 'necessary', 'explain', 'greatness', 'accomplishment', 'short', 'film', 'story', 'cursory', 'real', 'Amelia', 'Earhart', 'life', 'was', 'full', 'extraordinary', 'episodes.Richard', 'Gere', 'George', 'P.', 'Putnam', 'successful', 'publisher', 'promoter', 'who', 'later', 'married', 'America', 'Earhart', 'film', 'conflicts', 'relationships', 'instead', 'exploring', 'reasons', 'director', 'Mira', 'Nair', 'hurries', 'next', 'scene', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'totally', 'wasted', 'Gene', 'Vidal', 'father', 'author', 'Gore', 'so', 'Mia', 'Wasikowska', 'Elinor', 'Smith.The', 'flying', 'sequences', 'are', 'beautifully', 'done', 'special', 'effects', 'need', 'improvement', 'story', 'great', 'better', 'treatment']",N/A

Miss Earhart was a heroine who fearlessly attacked and conquered numerous flying records in the years before world War II.  She was beloved by most in my parents generation.""Amelia"" (played by Hilary Swank)  does a good job of telling the story of Earhart's personal and business life.  We experience with them the difficulties obtaining financing for flying events.  We view the budding romance and marriage of Amelia and George Putnam  (Played by Richard Gere).  We also learn of Amelia's feminist attitudes and her affair with Gene Vidal (well played by Ewan McGregor).  So as a film about Miss Earhart's personal life, Amelia is excellent.""Amelia"" has a great cast, but the characters appear one dimensional..  I have seen movies where each of these main actors were superior in their parts.  In this film both Swank and Gere present cardboard characterizations of the people they play.  I believe that the script is the problem.  The scenes provided to the actors leave little room to demonstrate their acting skills.  For example, George Putman does occasionally appear hurt by the actions of his wife, but the scenes are too short to allow Gere to capitalize on the emotions that Putman must have felt.Amelia"" was a bit of a disappointment to me on the way it presented flying.  I expected this film to enhance  the love of flying by helping the audience feel the joy of solo flight.  There were some brief scenes of Amelia flying but they were mostly just a glimpse not a celebration of flight.  Amelia Earhart is best known to us as a person who loves flying more than anything.I believe that much more emphasis needed to be put on the flying itself.
