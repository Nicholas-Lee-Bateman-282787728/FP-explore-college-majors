1537334,A28JGV8PVHV3ZQ,B007RP4CIM,"EnglishMajor ""Fran""","[3, 3]","Not what I was expecting. I had read a review of Bourne's production in The New Yorker, so I knew it was an all-male cast, with the Prince falling in love with a male Swan Prince (Odette/Odile). However, I anticipated a classical production a la the Bolshoi. This is neither that, nor is it Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo (also well worth seeing). Instead, the program begins with a series of increasingly comic set pieces - the little boy Prince is bullied by his mother, the older Prince becomes infatuated with a comically sluttish girl, much to his mother's dismay, & follows the girl to a nightclub where the dancing is a mashup of 1940s swing, 1950s jive & stylized 1960s dances like the Twist. He gets drunk, staggers out into the night & finds himself stumbling along the waterfront (not the classical lake). The (male) swans come out to dance the classic ensemble set piece, whereupon the Prince falls in love with the lead swan. Everyone familiar with Tchaikovsky's story knows what happens after that. The dancing, costumes, sets etc. are terrific. You'll need to take a few breaks - this is a lengthy (3+ hours) production, & no matter how much you love the ballet, that's a long time to sit through a video. But well worth the time for anyone who loves dance performances.",4,"Odd, funny, beautiful",1352160000,"11 6, 2012",2012,1292,"['Not', 'what', 'was', 'expecting', 'had', 'read', 'review', 'Bourne', 'production', 'New', 'Yorker', 'knew', 'was', 'all-male', 'cast', 'Prince', 'falling', 'love', 'male', 'Swan', 'Prince', 'Odette/Odile', 'However', 'anticipated', 'classical', 'production', 'la', 'Bolshoi', 'Les', 'Ballets', 'Trockadero', 'Monte', 'Carlo', 'also', 'well', 'seeing', 'Instead', 'program', 'series', 'increasingly', 'comic', 'set', 'pieces', 'little', 'boy', 'Prince', 'bullied', 'mother', 'older', 'Prince', 'becomes', 'infatuated', 'comically', 'sluttish', 'girl', 'much', 'mother', 'dismay', 'girl', 'nightclub', 'where', 'dancing', 'mashup', '1940s', 'swing', '1950s', 'jive', 'stylized', '1960s', 'dances', 'Twist', 'drunk', 'staggers', 'out', 'night', 'stumbling', 'waterfront', 'not', 'classical', 'lake', 'male', 'come', 'out', 'dance', 'classic', 'ensemble', 'set', 'piece', 'Prince', 'love', 'lead', 'swan', 'Everyone', 'familiar', 'Tchaikovsky', 'story', 'what', 'dancing', 'costumes', 'sets', 'etc', 'are', 'terrific', ""'ll"", 'need', 'take', 'few', 'breaks', 'lengthy', '3+', 'hours', 'production', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'love', 'ballet', 'long', 'time', 'sit', 'video', 'well', 'time', 'anyone', 'who', 'dance', 'performances']",N/A

Whereas Adam Cooper exuded masculinity, I'm afraid I can't say the same about Richard Winsor in THIS version, and so, for me, it was a wasted $25+.  A few years ago I loaned out my DVD of it with Cooper, which was never returned, and so I was thrilled to see that it was coming out on Blu-ray, just assuming that it was the amazing original.  So I was startled to find when it arrived that it was a different performance with different principals, and I'm afraid I could barely get through it and probably will never watch it again. I'll likely RE-buy the stunning Adam Cooper original DVD of it -- which is the version they SHOULD have released on Blu-ray!  This new one DOES have its moments -- for example, I prefer this older Prince to the one with Cooper, but that's not why most of us buy Matthew Bourne's ""Swan Lake""!
