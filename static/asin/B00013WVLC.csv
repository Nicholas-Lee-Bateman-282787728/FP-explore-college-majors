This movie has Anne going back to work in her old job..and what the heck does Jack do all day long?..he makes trouble, trouble for the neighbors upstairs, trouble for the noise on their terrace, he is going CRAZY staying home all day long....he's screaming at the traffic from 16 floors up!..it is a total riot...then along comes ""Plaza Suite"" really filmed at the old Plaza Hotel and three stories all involving the stay at the Plaza..THANK GOD WE have that movie on film because it was ripped apart for CONDOS!..and don't forget ""Barefoot in the Park""..I LOVE NEIL SIMON....so back to second ave....the most hilarious line is when they get robbed and Anne is talking to the police ,slowing loosing it like Jack does...policeman asks,""So lady can you explain what happend?..Anne,"" what do you mean what happened? Once we HAD IT AND NOW THEY HAVE IT..they robbed us!"" I am off on the words Mr.Simon but you get the gist!...and then you can't speak about Neil without mentioning Mildred Natwick in ""Barefoot in the Park""...who BTW was nominated for an Oscar and rightly so!.She gives a performance that really overshadows the cast...and the cast is STELLAR..JANE FONDA,ChaRLES BOYER & ROBERT REDFORD...ALL ABOUT LIVING IN NYC AND TAKE NOTE OF ALL THESE MOVIES BECAUSE WE DO NOT HAVE OUR WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK LIKE YOU SEE IT IN THE FILM...and side note: this park is really a ""potter's field"" and so many bodies were buried there at the beginning of NYC history..there's no signs anywhere..but the Wash Sq Park underwent massive renovation..not the same park....Neil SImon always has NYC as a major backdrop/character in his movies and it's a touch of his that I love..either it be the script, the scenes taken in Was.Sq Park...almost like a tour of NYC without leaving your home!..don't overlook that part of the stories..Cheers..TONY(NYC)",5,LAUGHS LAUGHS AND MORE LAUGHS!,1336521600,"05 9, 2012",2012,2340,"['WARNING', 'THIS', 'REVEW', 'ABOUT', 'SEVERAL', 'NEIL', 'SIMON', 'MOVIES', 'LOVE', 'live', 'NYC', 'will', 'adore', 'movie', 'second', 'ave', 'WHY', 'so', 'much', 'money', 'DVD', 'love', 'Neil', 'SImon', 'view', 'NYC', 'REAL', 'pairing', 'Jack', 'Anne', 'was', 'priceless..maybe', ""'ll"", 'spend', '20', 'bucks', '..he', 'job', 'job', 'other', 'Neil', 'Simon', 'movie', 'Out', 'Towners', 'UTRA', 'hysterical', 'Sandy', 'Dennis', 'funny', 'just', 'thought', 'not', 'stay', 'NYC', 'movie', 'movie', 'Anne', 'going', 'back', 'work', 'old', 'job..and', 'what', 'heck', 'Jack', 'do', 'day', 'long', '..he', 'trouble', 'trouble', 'neighbors', 'upstairs', 'trouble', 'noise', 'terrace', 'going', 'CRAZY', 'staying', 'home', 'day', 'long', '.he', 'screaming', 'traffic', '16', 'floors', 'up', '..it', 'total', 'riot', 'then', 'Plaza', 'Suite', 'really', 'filmed', 'old', 'Plaza', 'Hotel', 'three', 'stories', 'involving', 'stay', 'Plaza..THANK', 'GOD', 'WE', 'have', 'movie', 'film', 'was', 'ripped', 'apart', 'CONDOS', '..and', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'Barefoot', 'Park', '..I', 'LOVE', 'NEIL', 'SIMON', 'back', 'second', 'ave', 'most', 'hilarious', 'line', 'when', 'get', 'robbed', 'Anne', 'talking', 'police', 'slowing', 'loosing', 'Jack', 'policeman', 'lady', 'can', 'explain', 'what', 'happend', '..Anne', 'what', 'do', 'mean', 'what', 'happened', 'HAD', 'IT', 'AND', 'NOW', 'THEY', 'HAVE', 'IT..they', 'robbed', 'am', 'off', 'words', 'Mr.Simon', 'get', 'gist', 'then', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'Neil', 'mentioning', 'Mildred', 'Natwick', 'Barefoot', 'Park', 'who', 'BTW', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'rightly', 'so', '.She', 'performance', 'really', 'cast', 'cast', 'STELLAR..JANE', 'FONDA', 'ChaRLES', 'BOYER', 'ROBERT', 'REDFORD', 'ABOUT', 'LIVING', 'IN', 'NYC', 'AND', 'TAKE', 'NOTE', 'ALL', 'THESE', 'MOVIES', 'BECAUSE', 'WE', 'DO', 'NOT', 'HAVE', 'OUR', 'WASHINGTON', 'SQUARE', 'PARK', 'LIKE', 'YOU', 'SEE', 'IT', 'IN', 'THE', 'FILM', 'side', 'note', 'park', 'really', 'potter', 'field', 'so', 'many', 'bodies', 'were', 'buried', 'beginning', 'NYC', 'signs', 'anywhere..but', 'Wash', 'Sq', 'Park', 'underwent', 'massive', 'renovation..not', 'same', 'park', '.Neil', 'SImon', 'always', 'NYC', 'major', 'backdrop/character', 'movies', 'touch', 'love..either', 'be', 'script', 'scenes', 'taken', 'Was.Sq', 'Park', 'almost', 'tour', 'NYC', 'leaving', 'home', '..do', ""n't"", 'overlook', 'part', 'stories..Cheers..TONY', 'NYC']",N/A

792699,A2H0Q6AGS7X55I,B00013WVLC,"D. R Hayes ""D.R. Hayes""","[22, 24]","This is one of my all time favorite movies. It shows the funny side of people only concerned about themselves. You have Jack Lemmon as a recently unemployed adman, and Anne Bancroft as his sympathetic yet let's be practical wife. I feel that this is both thier finest hours in this movie as the chemistry shows that they really enjoyed working with each other. I find Lemmon's character is one who just can't believe that his career is over, and he's nowhere near the age of retirement, and plus he's from the old school where the woman stayed at home while the man goes out, and gets the meat. When Bancroft's character goes to work it causes a breakdown in Lemmon's character as his perfect world continues to crumble making him hostile towards everyone; his family, friends, his wife, the upstairs neighbor(which the arguments between them are simpily hilarious), and Lemmon's own character's desire to get even, and win one for his own glory; so he ends up mugging a man in Central Park (played by Sylvester Stallone)because he thought it was the other way around. Bancroft's character is also becoming unglued by the constant work, and then she's laid off. There's also Lemmon's character's brother who's in love with hearing himself talk about how analytical his thinking is, and don't forget that upstairs neighbor who just wants peace and quiet in his perfect world because he has his own worries to deal with. Filmed in New York City I guess Neil Simon would know what NYC is like from a personal experience which is why this is so funny, and let's not forget the narrator who takes us through the news stories throughout.

But his character, Melvin Edison, is in serious need of mental intervention. Not the movie kind, I mean court-ordered supervised therapy. This isn't acid reflux and heart attack anymore - his ranting and raving borders on psychotic homicide or suicide, maybe both.I was cringing throughout the entire production. This movie honestly hurts to watch. And it's listed as a 'comedy'? For whom? Leather-hooded masochists?This isn't to say the performances aren't worthy of merit. Anne Bancroft is particularly good as ever-supportive wife, Edna, who sadly ends up sharing her husband's fate. But performances aren't a movie. Somewhere in all that explosive energy there has to be a story; some point, some resolution. I don't get where watching two people being ground into hopeless oblivion qualifies as funny.Seriously, if we follow the movie's logic, the next scene following the end of the film: The neighbors complaining about ""the awful smell"" coming from apartment unit 14-B.Not worth the time spent. I'm indebted to the technician/inventor that created the fast-forward button.A superior version of Jack in a nearly identical, but infinitely funnier and sympathetic performance, check out 'The Out-of-Towners' filmed five years earlier.
