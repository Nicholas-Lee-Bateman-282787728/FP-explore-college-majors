1694310,A1R8LZYZR3377O,B00IJS2OHM,ajsteele,"[0, 0]","Your getting lucky when you select a film like ""The Trials Of Cate McCain"" even considering that it is such a mundane sounding title. Kate Beckensale as an attorney battling alcoholism is thoroughly absorbing as the splinters of life consume her. The film contains a wide array of excellent actors that most of us haven't seen in awhile and their portrayals are definitely worth multiple viewings. Nick Nolte especially, who's name I thought may have been stamped on the movie just to give it gravitas, is certainly compelling as he seemingly brings his life experience to the script and sells it 100%. A simple but subtly powerful performance as Beckensale's mentor.A little history about this movie- It was released theatrically in Hungary and reportedly had a bad box office return. It was decided that a U.S. and UK release would be skipped. The film was bought by the Lifetime network and some watched it there giving it bad on line reviews, possibly because of its connection to a supposed low quality network and whatever else. Thankfully the theatrical version was cold pressed to dvd which saved it from bogus network editing. I also read that actor Taye Diggs was in the film but his scenes were removed. I find that odd but never the less he is listed as an actor in the film. My personal feelings are that marketing mistakes and knee jerk decisions caused this very good film to die an untimely movie theatre death.Anyone that is either in recovery or recovered from substance abuse should seriously identify with many scenarios in the film but there are enough accurate emotional stirrings for the average movie goer to ponder as well. Ms.Beckensale is Oscar worthy as she navigates through the dilemmas of her fractured life. It's good to see the philosophy of the 12 steps incorporated into a movie in a realistic way. The believability factor is exceptionally high on all fronts. I intend to purchase this film and I obviously highly recommend it.",5,Theatrical medicine for sobriety,1402704000,"06 14, 2014",2014,1963,"['getting', 'lucky', 'when', 'select', 'film', 'Trials', 'Cate', 'McCain', 'even', 'considering', 'such', 'mundane', 'sounding', 'title', 'Kate', 'Beckensale', 'attorney', 'battling', 'alcoholism', 'thoroughly', 'absorbing', 'splinters', 'life', 'consume', 'film', 'wide', 'array', 'excellent', 'actors', 'most', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'awhile', 'portrayals', 'are', 'definitely', 'worth', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'especially', 'who', 'name', 'thought', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'stamped', 'movie', 'just', 'give', 'gravitas', 'certainly', 'compelling', 'seemingly', 'life', 'experience', 'script', '100', '%', 'A', 'simple', 'subtly', 'powerful', 'performance', 'Beckensale', 'mentor.A', 'little', 'history', 'movie-', 'was', 'released', 'theatrically', 'Hungary', 'reportedly', 'had', 'bad', 'box', 'office', 'return', 'was', 'decided', 'U.S.', 'UK', 'release', 'would', 'be', 'skipped', 'film', 'was', 'bought', 'Lifetime', 'network', 'watched', 'giving', 'bad', 'line', 'reviews', 'possibly', 'connection', 'supposed', 'low', 'quality', 'network', 'whatever', 'else', 'Thankfully', 'theatrical', 'version', 'was', 'cold', 'pressed', 'dvd', 'saved', 'bogus', 'network', 'editing', 'also', 'read', 'actor', 'Taye', 'Diggs', 'was', 'film', 'scenes', 'were', 'removed', 'find', 'odd', 'never', 'less', 'listed', 'actor', 'film', 'personal', 'feelings', 'are', 'marketing', 'mistakes', 'knee', 'jerk', 'decisions', 'caused', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'die', 'untimely', 'movie', 'theatre', 'death.Anyone', 'either', 'recovery', 'recovered', 'substance', 'abuse', 'should', 'seriously', 'identify', 'many', 'scenarios', 'film', 'are', 'enough', 'accurate', 'emotional', 'stirrings', 'average', 'movie', 'goer', 'ponder', 'as', 'well', 'Ms.Beckensale', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'dilemmas', 'fractured', 'life', 'good', 'see', 'philosophy', '12', 'steps', 'incorporated', 'movie', 'realistic', 'way', 'believability', 'factor', 'exceptionally', 'high', 'fronts', 'intend', 'purchase', 'film', 'obviously', 'highly', 'recommend']",Trials of Cate McCall

1694314,AYG1U47VFZ165,B00IJS2OHM,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[2, 3]","Kate Beckinsale is one of those modern day actresses who &#8211; despite being in a series of major motion pictures &#8211; really has never quite &#8216;broken through&#8217; the way some of her contemporaries have.  In fairness, that could be because some of those films have been structured as more tent-pole summer fare, and they just didn&#8217;t perform the way producers and studio heads figured they would.  As a consequence, maybe she&#8217;s an honest A-List actress who&#8217;s still searching for some solid A-List material.  As much as I enjoyed what she brought to the table with something as noble as THE TRIALS OF CATE MCCALL, I still don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s what anyone would imagine is &#8216;break out&#8217; material.  That&#8217;s not because of Kate, mind you: methinks it&#8217;s because writer/director Karen Moncrieff never really marshaled her creative forces to deliver something that didn&#8217;t feel like a Lifetime Network &#8216;Movie of the Week.&#8217;(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters.  If you&#8217;re the type of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I&#8217;d encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you&#8217;re accepting of a few modest hints at &#8216;things to come,&#8217; then read on &#8230;)Cate McCall (played by the lovely Kate Beckinsale) is at a curious crossroads in her life.  Her legal career has fallen apart as some of her personal behavior &#8211; alcoholism &#8211; finally impaired her judgment to the point of her suspension from the Bar.  Her married life has followed suit, leaving her with an estranged husband Josh (David Lyons) and a young daughter Augie (Ava Kolker) who hardly knows her.  Her last, best friend is her mentor and sponsor, Bridges (a grizzled Nick Nolte).  While serving out her penance at rehabilitation, McCall takes the case for a young rape victim Lacey Stubbs (Anna Anissimova) who appears to have been wrongly convicted of murder.  Helping the young woman to put her life back together provides Cate the inspiration to follow suit, but could both of their journeys been little more than a case of mistaken identity?THE TRIALS OF CATE MCCALL suitably serves up a roster of characters that, unfortunately, feel all a bit worn thin in the age of the modern legal thriller.  You&#8217;ve got the young hotshot attorney who&#8217;s fallen from grace; you&#8217;ve got the seasoned legal veteran with a heart of gold; you&#8217;ve got the contemporary rape victim who may not quite be telling the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth; and you&#8217;ve got enough supporting law enforcement officers, attorneys, and judges who use their respective careers as more like their own personal property than they do pursuing justice.  For all of that disservice, there&#8217;s really no one else to blame than writer/director Karen Moncrieff.  She attacks much of this with only a flair for the televised theatrical, leaving the bulk of TRIALS feeling a bit too familiar, a bit too comfortable, and a bit too contrived.However, there&#8217;s something to be said for performers showing up and hitting their marks, even if that never causes the film to rise above standard TV fare.  Almost as if to spite such uninteresting direction from Moncrieff, everyone pulls together and manages to hoist the thing up so that audiences can benefit from players who wanted this probably to be something more than what it is.  Much of the credit goes to Beckinsale; I&#8217;ve seen her in other flicks where I thought she was horribly miscast, but there&#8217;s something almost effortless about her work here, and it works.  Who knows?  It could be because this film didn&#8217;t get the wide exposure some of her other ones did; the lowered expectations may have played to her (and everyone&#8217;s) strengths.And don&#8217;t be confused: these TRIALS aren&#8217;t only limited to affairs of the law.  Cate McCall has her own demons she&#8217;s dealing with here, and it&#8217;ll involve matters of personal addiction as well as trying to come to grips with what it means to be a responsible mother even when you find you might be giving more than your fair share.  That&#8217;s part of what keeps the audience guessing once the trial ends and the picture doesn&#8217;t fade-to-black: Cate&#8217;s not quite yet done with putting all of these affairs in order, and her journey of discovery is far from over.  Hang with it until the end, and you&#8217;ll likely find yourself reasonably entertained.THE TRIALS OF CATE MCCALL (2013) is produced by Sunrise Films (II), Pitbull Pictures, and Sierra / Affinity.  DVD distribution is being handled by Vertical Entertainment.  As for the technical specifications, this is one smartly shot film with some very high quality sights and sounds, though I&#8217;ll admit I had some modest issues with the sound mix in the early stages.  Not a big deal, but it makes hearing what Nick Nolte is saying a bit difficult.  Lastly as I was provided only a DVD screener and not the final product I&#8217;ve no way to know whether or not the commercial release will have any special features, though I&#8217;d be inclined to give a best-educated guess that there won&#8217;t be any.  I could be wrong.  It&#8217;s happened before.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  If you can forgive Nick Nolte grumbling his way through another performance as well as the surprisingly uninspired if not robotic presentation of it all as managed by writer/director Karen Moncrieff, then you&#8217;ll be left with exactly the product I enjoyed: THE TRIALS OF CATE MCCALL.  Yes, it&#8217;s part legal thriller; and, yes, it&#8217;s part recovery drama; but it&#8217;s all pretty likeable with Kate Beckinsale&#8217;s doe-eyed expressions of loss, grief, and confusion.  Mind you: it may not be the least predictable movie you watch today, but it might be the most interesting.In the interests of fairness, I&#8217;m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Greenleaf and Associates provided me with a DVD screener copy of THE TRIALS OF CATE MCCALL by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review; and their contribution to me in no way, shape, or form

I am use to her looking put together and confident (i.e., Underworld franchise and Click), but in this one, she was a physical and emotional mess (I mean you could still see her beauty shining thru, but there was a vulnerability that shown as well). She was flawed and human. And as usual, Nick Nolte was a delight (Nolte played Bridges). He also plays that character that is authentic and honest (i.e., Prince of Tides). I would definitely recommend this movie and give it 4 stars.",4,Definitely worth spending a quiet afternoon watching!,1403654400,"06 25, 2014",2014,1359,"['Troubled', 'attorney', 'Cate', 'McCall', 'crossroads', 'lost', 'custody', 'daughter', 'recovering', 'alcoholic', 'simply', 'break', 'trusted', 'comrade', 'arms', 'Bridges', 'handling', 'wrongfully', 'convicted', 'inmate', 'appeal', 'may', 'be', 'just', 'ticket', 'vindication', 'redemption', 'However', 'teeth', 'case', 'fights', 'who', 'wrongfully', 'convicted', 'murder', 'suspect', 'truth', 'more', 'complicated', 'initially', 'thought', 'love', 'thriller', 'delicate', 'balance', 'right', 'wrong', 'was', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'surprised', 'end', 'did', 'way', 'Cate', 'personal', 'trials', 'mirrored', 'professional', 'ones.In', 'conclusion', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Trials', 'Cate', 'McCall', 'was', 'glad', 'see', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'really', 'sink', 'teeth', 'roll', 'traditionally', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'am', 'use', 'looking', 'put', 'together', 'confident', 'i.e.', 'Underworld', 'franchise', 'Click', 'one', 'was', 'physical', 'emotional', 'mess', 'mean', 'could', 'still', 'see', 'beauty', 'shining', 'thru', 'there', 'was', 'vulnerability', 'shown', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'flawed', 'human', 'usual', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'was', 'delight', 'Nolte', 'played', 'Bridges', 'also', 'character', 'authentic', 'honest', 'i.e.', 'Prince', 'Tides', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'movie', 'give', '4', 'stars']",Trials of Cate McCall

She has a drinking issue which has compounded her problems as it has placed her on the ugly end of a custody case. The bad news is that Nick Nolte is the one helping to keep her sober (search Nolte 2002 DUI arrest photo). In spite of her personal issues, Cate is good in the courtroom and likes to win. She is given a pro bono case of a woman convicted of murder (Anna Anissimova) who claims she is innocent.As Cate investigates the case she discovers layers of lies and misconduct by the police. She becomes convinced of her innocence and works to get her released in a courtroom case that goes like a hot knife through butter. In fact it was too easy as my John Katzenbach flashbacks materialized before my eyes. Ho-hum. I felt like I had been there and done that before.The film was done fairly well for a 90 minute production. There were things that weren't explained. Was the car crash an attempt on her life or a co-incidence? In many ways the film felt incomplete. Her personal demons seemed glossed over and exactly how did her relationship fall so fast with her daughter, or did she ever have one?In many ways it reminded me of a Lifetime film. 3 1/2 starsParental Guide: F-bomb.

She has fallen on hard times and is trying to get her life back together. In order to be reinstated to the bar and get her kid back she must complete a 12 step program and work on the appeal of a woman who is in prison for murder.  What starts off as an easy case becomes more and more difficult with everything she uncovers. I was looking forward to watching this because I really love courtroom dramas. That said I liked this even more than I was expecting to. This is a movie that entirely sucks you in right away and you become deeply involved in Cate&#8217;s life. You pull for her to get her daughter back and are upset when she takes a step back. The court case is also unbelievably interesting and keeps the movie that much more interesting. This is the kind of movie that gets you thinking one way and at the last minute throws you a twist that makes you look back at everything you saw and wonder if you missed something. I don&#8217;t want to give anything away but I will say that the movie is hard to predict, which is what makes it so good. If you liked &#8230;And Justice For All you will love this movie.
