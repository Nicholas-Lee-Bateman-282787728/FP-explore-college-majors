Yes, Mill Creek also corrected the mistake on the cover slip to the correct sound format, instead of Dolby Digital 2.0. OK, it's just marginally sharp then my anamorphic DVD copy from UK, but contrast is definitely better! The DTS-HD MA 4.0 actually sounded pretty solid with good directional effects and bass.No extra though. But at this cheap price, it definitely worth the upgrade compare to that 10 years old full screen DVD by Disney! Who is the crazy one who will pay $48 for that (unless you want it original DISNEY!)?

252704,APN1SGMOQV5GO,6301432827,Daniel J. Griffin Jr.,"[0, 0]","PARENTAL NOTICE: The movie contains quite a bit of nonsexual frontal nudity of native Africans.  Parents buying this for their kids should be aware of this fact.Having gotten that out of the way, let's move on to the actual review.Baby: Secret of the Lost Legend is an adventure movie from 1985.  It concerns the legendary cryptid Mokele-mbembe of the Congo Basin area of Africa.  The creature is presented here as being a brontosaurus (apatasaurus wasn't widely accepted as the proper name by most laymen in the 1980s).  William Katt and Sean Young portray a young married American couple in Africa who find a family of these dinosaurs while investigating an illness in a remote villiage.The special effects are very, very dated by today's standards but still remarkable for their ability to add to the story.  Baby, the titular character, is given a range of emotions despite being little more than a large amount of foam rubber.  William Katt and Sean Young both give decent performances and Patrick McGoohan is wonderful as the professor obsessed with the creatures.  The story isn't especially deep and there are a number of standard 80's movie cliches such as the near mandatory helicopter chase scene.I enjoyed this movie as a kid and am happy to have it in my collection.  It won't be to everyone's taste, especially people who've gotten used to ""Jurassic Park"" style dinosaurs.  With a little suspention of disbelief, however, it can be appreciated by anybody who's ever wanted to find something amazing.",3,A hidden gem from the 80s,1359331200,"01 28, 2013",2013,1513,"['PARENTAL', 'NOTICE', 'movie', 'quite', 'bit', 'nonsexual', 'frontal', 'nudity', 'native', 'Africans', 'Parents', 'buying', 'kids', 'should', 'be', 'aware', 'fact.Having', 'gotten', 'way', 'let', 'move', 'actual', 'review.Baby', 'Secret', 'Lost', 'Legend', 'adventure', 'movie', '1985', 'legendary', 'cryptid', 'Mokele-mbembe', 'Congo', 'Basin', 'area', 'Africa', 'creature', 'presented', 'here', 'being', 'brontosaurus', 'apatasaurus', 'was', ""n't"", 'widely', 'accepted', 'proper', 'name', 'most', 'laymen', '1980s', 'William', 'Katt', 'Sean', 'Young', 'portray', 'young', 'married', 'American', 'couple', 'Africa', 'who', 'find', 'family', 'dinosaurs', 'investigating', 'illness', 'remote', 'villiage.The', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'very', 'very', 'dated', 'today', 'standards', 'still', 'remarkable', 'ability', 'add', 'story', 'Baby', 'titular', 'character', 'given', 'range', 'emotions', 'being', 'little', 'more', 'large', 'amount', 'foam', 'rubber', 'William', 'Katt', 'Sean', 'Young', 'give', 'decent', 'performances', 'Patrick', 'McGoohan', 'wonderful', 'professor', 'obsessed', 'creatures', 'story', ""n't"", 'especially', 'deep', 'are', 'number', 'standard', '80', 'movie', 'cliches', 'such', 'near', 'mandatory', 'helicopter', 'chase', 'scene.I', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'kid', 'am', 'happy', 'have', 'collection', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'everyone', 'taste', 'especially', 'people', 'who', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'used', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'style', 'dinosaurs', 'little', 'suspention', 'disbelief', 'however', 'can', 'be', 'appreciated', 'anybody', 'who', 'ever', 'wanted', 'find', 'something', 'amazing']",Baby: Secret of Lost Legend VHS

252708,A7Y0MEKYZS3X6,6301432827,DroutKaiser,"[0, 0]","man this movie!, when i saw it here on amazon i had to buy it hands down. I remember watching this as a kid whenever i had the chance to rent it from an old video store that i used to go and since it was about dinosaurs specially from the brontosaurus(which is one of my favorites species) it was natural for me to see it and i was never disappoint by the movie .Pretty much the story revolves around a scientist discovers the existence of dinosaurs and is killed by another one who wants to take the discovery for himself and become famous. A marry couple try there best to protect this species from been taken by the evil scientist which in this aspect is about the baby brontosaurus. A simple story yet effective, interesting enough this movie was aim for kids which in today standards it wouldn't considered as such. For what it was of its time, the effects where really impressive, one could say Jurassic Park got inspire by this movie.Now for the blue ray version of this i have to say its kinda disappointing in some aspect ( do not have the dvd version but bare with me):- the menu selection is very simple with 2 options, play and chapter select.- No extra There is no Extra which this could have been pretty nice to see like some documentary of the making of the movie, the making of the dinosaurs, some deleted scene or how they did the special effects. heck they could just added a picture collection or some video promotions of the movie when it was gonna be shown in theaters.- No subtitles:  there is no subtitles options which this could have been of great help since there are scenes that the audio of the characters gets kinda nullified by the music or the sound effects and is kinda noticeable when the main characters are talking and you wanna understand what there saying ( this is only on certain scenes but not in all the movie).- The unbalancing audio: the balance in the sound effects and the music is kinda off, sometimes the music or the sound effect will just go to loud than usual and i have to lower the volume on my TV because of it and then i might not be able to hear the main characters talking.- Lower quality video for a Blue-ray: kinda disappointing on this movie, I understand this is a 28 year old movie which is old and its not easy to clean it up but i seen blue-ray of old movies to be more clear than this, and it doesn't help by the fact when you are in the menu and you see the background animation been so clean and clear, i was really really impress by it that i though the movie would look like that, but when i hit play and i see the movie starting the quality, although better than a VHS (video tape), it looks more like a dvd instead of a blue-ray which is kinda disappointing. then again this is a $5 blue-ray movie so hard to see them do that. also i feel this movie should have been wide-screen.Sure i mention some of the negative of the blue-ray version, but even with that i still don't regret getting it. This is a movie that i grew up with and I always wanted to have. Im really happy to have bought it when i got the chance, sure i would love to see some more improvements like the quality video, audio, subtitles and some extra features, but this is what one gets for $5, a simple menu so this should be expected.is it worth to get?

252722,A96K1ZGW56S2I,6301432827,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[2, 3]","I remember first watching BABY: SECRET OF THE LOST LEGEND with my family on the screen of a drive-in movie theatre.  Like many children my age, I was fascinated with dinosaurs (and still am) and found the movie completely captivating.  I remember crying at a particular scene in the movie and trying to understand why the soldiers with guns were so cruel.  Many years later I have been able to watch the film again.  I noticed many things I would have never noticed as a kid, such as pacing, acting, etc.  However, despite having been made over twenty years ago, BABY remains rather well-preserved and is a special treat for those with a nostalgic attachment.BABY begins in the streets of an African city during a parade and festival that reminded me of some from a James Bond movie.  One man is being pursued through the streets by another.  The chase ends in an alley and we discover why the one man was being hunted:  photos of the mysterious Mokele-Mbembe, a supposed dinosaur that natives of the Congo believe to still exist and roam the jungles to this day.  From the festive streets, the film quickly moves to a more remote area where American sportswriter George Loomis (William Katt of THE GREATEST AMERICAN HERO fame) is trying to teach some of the natives at a paleontological research camp how to play baseball.  He is interrupted by a phone call from New York offering him a job at the Times.  George is eager to get back to the States, but receives the offer just as his wife, Susan Matthews-Loomis (Sean Young), has discovered the biggest find of her life. Susan's mentor, Dr. Eric Kiviat (Patrick McGoohan), tries to downplay her discovery and claims it's just a giraffe.  However, after talking with a Red Cross relief worker, Susan begins to realize that her discovery was substantial.  A little marital conflict ensues, but Susan sets off down river and is immediately followed by George.  Their voyage brings them in contact with a small family of brontosaurs (now known as apatosaurs).  But Susan and George aren't the only one's looking for the dinosaurs, so is Dr. Kiviat and he has hired an army of guerilla soldiers to help him capture the creatures and bring them to captivity.  The dinos are in some serious trouble and Susan and George are their only chance for escape.BABY has elements from several different film genres as evidenced by the cover of the DVD which quotes the Los Angeles Daily News as saying BABY is ""a cross between RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK and E.T.""  There clearly is some evidence of Indiana Jones, especially towards the beginning of the movie and at the end.  The film does have a similar spirit as E.T. in that Baby becomes separated from her parents and Susan and George try to reunite the broken family.  As I mentioned earlier, there also seems to be a bit of spy-action involved, ala James Bond that influences the opening sequence and the way the villain, Dr. Kiviat reacts through much of the film.  Despite this hodge-podge of genre mashing, BABY works.  The different influences don't stand out in any jarring way and the overall structure of the film flows together rather nicely.The movie has also aged rather well.  Except for a few items of clothing and a heavy bent towards the changing roles of men and women, it's difficult to place the film from a specific period.  The movie was made in the mid 1980s, but if someone didn't know that they might guess the movie was made anywhere from the late 1960s until the mid 1990s.  About the only thing that has drastically changed since BABY was released are special effects.  The special effects in BABY are a far cry from the CGI-heavy films audiences have now become acquainted with.  Nevertheless, at the time BABY offered some impressive special effects.  Animatronics and classic film trickery make up the bulk of the movie's special effects and they really aren't that bad.BABY is rated PG, but there are some parents who feel the film isn't appropriate for children.  The film was released just as the PG-13 rating was being used.  Sensitive parents should know that the movie includes some violence (soldiers with guns, natives with bows and arrows, explosions), some nudity (once again natives dancing and walking in the wilderness), and some foul language.  I don't think any of this takes away from the film or is anything that should cause parents and guardians to become overtly concerned about.  The violence in the film is of the type that was typical of early 1980s family television and seems almost cartoony compared to what passes on network television today.  The nudity is akin to pictures from National Geographic and the foul language is used rarely (I think there are some sh**s and a couple of d**ns).  There's also a hint of sexual innuendo, but it occurs between the married husband and his wife and doesn't seem out of place.  In fact, the relationship between George and Susan is a healthy one and could be viewed as a cinematic example of what a healthy, functional marriage is supposed to look like.I loved BABY when I first saw it as a child and it was one of those movies that has stuck with me my whole life.  Seeing the film decades later, I know that it isn't the greatest dinosaur movie ever made, but it's not really that bad either.",4,An Overlooked and Undervalued Treat---3.5 Stars,1175558400,"04 3,
