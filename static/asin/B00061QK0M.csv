855582,A3PGIRULVPBJ1,B00061QK0M,Amazon Customer,"[1, 9]","This is a pretty funny movie that succeeds because it seems to fly in the face of political correctness.  I thought ""wow, he must be getting feminists really angry with this film"" and it was nice to think of Ferrell as being free from the Hollywood requirement to think alike.  Then he throws in a useless and cliched jab at President Bush at the end (I am no fan of Bush) and I lost all respect for him.  It was like he did not have the guts to fully carry out this assault on political correctness and let his fans down in the end in order to kowtow to the very people he mocks the whole movie. It reminded me of the racists who say ""well i am not a racist since I have a black friend.""

Of course, as is the case in everything Hollywood puts out, the female lead (Applegate) has all of the talent and the men around her are just dumb fools.

And yet this movie is not funny. One or two smirks, but not a single laugh. Elf was hilarious. Loved him in Zoolander.

I was expecting a bonus disc of deleted and extended scenes, cast notes, etc... I had no idea they had filmed enough footage to cut another movie together. I loved the original Anchorman movie, so I was pretty excited to see this ""bonus movie"".""Wake Up Ron Burgundy"" contains some scenes that could easily have been used in the original movie. There is some hilarious material to be discovered on this disc. The DVD also contains Rehearsal footage, Ron Burgundy's award acceptance speeches, MTV Movie Award interviews and even some skits they seemed to film for no other reason than their own amusement. This is great material to have if you like the ""Channel 4 News Team"", as they are truly permitted to run wild in these bonus features. I have not been able to find this DVD offered on its own and I'm assuming it is of limited quantity, so get it while you can...As far as I know, the only way to get it is to purchase it in the bundle with the original. I actually had to buy the movie again when I found out there was another DVD to be seen. The original had left me with countless lines to quote and so many scenes I found myself rewinding over and over again that I decided to splurge and get the bonus disc along with another original copy.If you enjoyed Ron, Champ, Brian & Brick in Anchorman, you will definitely enjoy this movie.""If we encounter any hostiles, silent throat cuts only"" - Brick Tambland.",5,"Wake Up, Ron Burgundy",1129680000,"10 19, 2005",2005,1527,"['Commenting', 'strictly', 'Bonus', 'DVD', 'Wake', 'Up', 'Ron', 'Burgundy', 'must', 'say', 'expectations', 'were', 'far', 'surpassed', 'was', 'expecting', 'bonus', 'disc', 'deleted', 'extended', 'scenes', 'cast', 'notes', 'etc', 'had', 'idea', 'had', 'filmed', 'enough', 'footage', 'cut', 'movie', 'together', 'loved', 'original', 'Anchorman', 'movie', 'was', 'pretty', 'excited', 'see', 'bonus', 'movie', 'Wake', 'Up', 'Ron', 'Burgundy', 'scenes', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'original', 'movie', 'hilarious', 'material', 'be', 'discovered', 'disc', 'DVD', 'also', 'Rehearsal', 'footage', 'Ron', 'Burgundy', 'award', 'acceptance', 'speeches', 'MTV', 'Movie', 'Award', 'interviews', 'even', 'skits', 'seemed', 'film', 'other', 'reason', 'own', 'amusement', 'great', 'material', 'have', 'like', 'Channel', '4', 'News', 'Team', 'are', 'truly', 'permitted', 'run', 'wild', 'bonus', 'features', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'able', 'find', 'DVD', 'offered', 'own', ""'m"", 'assuming', 'limited', 'quantity', 'so', 'get', 'can', 'As', 'far', 'know', 'only', 'way', 'get', 'purchase', 'bundle', 'original', 'actually', 'had', 'buy', 'movie', 'again', 'when', 'found', 'there', 'was', 'DVD', 'be', 'seen', 'original', 'had', 'left', 'countless', 'lines', 'quote', 'so', 'many', 'scenes', 'found', 'rewinding', 'over', 'again', 'decided', 'splurge', 'get', 'bonus', 'disc', 'original', 'copy.If', 'enjoyed', 'Ron', 'Champ', 'Brian', 'Brick', 'Anchorman', 'will', 'definitely', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'encounter', 'hostiles', 'silent', 'throat', 'cuts', 'only', 'Brick', 'Tambland']",N/A
855589,A2WPL6Y08K6ZQH,B00061QK0M,"Narut Ujnat ""Enthusiasm is contagious.""","[9, 21]","I didn't like this movie.  I wanted to like it, and I watched the whole thing, but I still didn't get it.First, having lived through the 70's, I can tell you that it ws not lived as though life was a porn movie set.  However, with the over the top hair and suits, it sure seemed to me that Will Ferrell (who co-wrote this movie) has the idea that Boogie Nights is a definitive picture showing the 1970's.  The entire movie seemed to be ripped off from Boogie Nights and the Beastie Boys video for 'Sabotage.'  The pool scene where Ferrell does the cannonball - right from Boogie Nights.  The girls running around - I don't think so. Gee, start playing some awful music and see what happens?  If this was a running joke, it didn't seem to be funny.I don't understand Will Ferrell.  I know many people think he is HILARIOUS.  I don't.  I guess what bothered me about this movie is that from the start it doesn'it decide what it is doing.  Is it being played straight so the audience laughs -- no.  Is it being played as camp by the cast so we all laugh - not really.  Is it just unfunny - to me, yes.  If you appreciate overacting this is a movie for you.  Personally, I didn't need to see a male erection in the movie - what was the point (he liked the girl?).  If you want such comedy, I recommend the far more hilarious Steve Martin movie 'The Man With Two Brains (1983).'  Now, that is funny.  Here, it seems as though Mr. Ferrell is just utlizing a comic persona as one big Saturday Night sketch.  In fact the entire movie seems as though it is a SNL sketch without network censor constraints. This movie could't even get San Diego right.  For crying out loud, the buildings are all contemporary, and definitely not 1970's style.  Sheesh.  Could they have used a 1970's era shot of the city?  What was with the charecters.  The cowboy sports reporter - an overrated version of Don Meredith (way too over the top).  The weather guy ( a slow bus rider) is too stupid for comedy.  However, in the movie he supplies the best laughs with his comment ' LOUD NOISES.'  Yes, that was funny.  His pick up lines on Christina Applegate's charecter were funny as well, I have to say.  Paul Rudd's charecter, I didn't understand.  Frankly, the movie just didn't go anywher.  Kinda funny enough to keep you watching hoping for more laughs that never come.  Pleasure Town as an animated sketch - call the TBS boys - not funny.If your like me, you can appreciate comedy. I can appreciate stupid comedy movies.  I loved Dodgeball - that is a funny movie.  Here, it is obvious Will Ferrell is a dreadfully unfunny comedian.  His comedy is insipid, unfunny and uninspired.  He is a mediocre talent ( I don't mean to be so harsh, but it is my review).  He can be mildly amusing, and at times funny - at times. However, my Aunt Edna can be funny at times as well - she isn't on tv or in the movies. It is sad to me that our standards are so low that Will Ferrell is seen as some major talent.  He is not, but he is LAUGHING ALL THE WAY TO THE BANK.If you under 21, you may find this movie to be great , and that is wondeful for you.  If you think One Night at the Roxbury is a very funny movie, then this movie may be for you.  However, if you like to really laugh, then I think this movie is a waste of time.  Mr. Ferrell cannot act at all.  I cannot fathom if he is camp, or more likely just so bad of an actor that his charecter doesn't exist.  Either way, why give this movie  your time.  Rent Handball, or anything else for that matter.",1,Maybe I didn't get it - but I found it only mildly amusing!,1109980800,"03 5, 2005",2005,3523,"['did', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'wanted', 'like', 'watched', 'whole', 'thing', 'still', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'it.First', 'having', 'lived', '70', 'can', 'tell', 'not', 'lived', 'life', 'was', 'porn', 'movie', 'set', 'However', 'top', 'hair', 'suits', 'sure', 'seemed', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'who', 'co-wrote', 'movie', 'idea', 'Boogie', 'Nights', 'definitive', 'picture', 'showing', '1970', 'entire', 'movie', 'seemed', 'be', 'ripped', 'off', 'Boogie', 'Nights', 'Beastie', 'Boys', 'video', ""'Sabotage"", 'pool', 'scene', 'where', 'Ferrell', 'cannonball', 'right', 'Boogie', 'Nights', 'girls', 'running', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'Gee', 'start', 'playing', 'awful', 'music', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'running', 'joke', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'funny.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'know', 'many', 'people', 'think', 'HILARIOUS', 'do', ""n't"", 'guess', 'what', 'bothered', 'movie', 'start', 'decide', 'what', 'doing', 'being', 'played', 'straight', 'audience', 'being', 'played', 'camp', 'cast', 'laugh', 'not', 'really', 'just', 'unfunny', 'yes', 'appreciate', 'overacting', 'movie', 'Personally', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'see', 'male', 'erection', 'movie', 'was', 'point', 'liked', 'girl', 'want', 'such', 'comedy', 'recommend', 'far', 'more', 'hilarious', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'movie', 'Man', 'Two', 'Brains', '1983', 'Now', 'funny', 'Here', 'Mr.', 'Ferrell', 'just', 'utlizing', 'comic', 'persona', 'one', 'big', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'sketch', 'fact', 'entire', 'movie', 'SNL', 'sketch', 'network', 'censor', 'constraints', 'movie', ""could't"", 'even', 'get', 'San', 'Diego', 'right', 'crying', 'out', 'loud', 'buildings', 'are', 'contemporary', 'definitely', 'not', '1970', 'style', 'Sheesh', 'Could', 'have', 'used', '1970', 'era', 'shot', 'city', 'What', 'was', 'charecters', 'cowboy', 'sports', 'reporter', 'overrated', 'version', 'Don', 'Meredith', 'way', 'too', 'top', 'weather', 'guy', 'slow', 'bus', 'rider', 'too', 'stupid', 'comedy', 'However', 'movie', 'best', 'laughs', 'comment', 'LOUD', 'NOISES', 'Yes', 'was', 'funny', 'pick', 'up', 'lines', 'Christina', 'Applegate', 'charecter', 'were', 'funny', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'say', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'charecter', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'Frankly', 'movie', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'anywher', 'Kinda', 'funny', 'enough', 'keep', 'watching', 'hoping', 'more', 'laughs', 'never', 'come', 'Pleasure', 'Town', 'animated', 'sketch', 'call', 'TBS', 'boys', 'not', 'funny.If', 'can', 'appreciate', 'comedy', 'can', 'appreciate', 'stupid', 'comedy', 'movies', 'loved', 'Dodgeball', 'funny', 'movie', 'Here', 'obvious', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'dreadfully', 'unfunny', 'comedian', 'comedy', 'insipid', 'unfunny', 'uninspired', 'mediocre', 'talent', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'be', 'so', 'harsh', 'review', 'can', 'be', 'mildly', 'amusing', 'times', 'funny', 'times', 'However', 'Aunt', 'Edna', 'can', 'be', 'funny', 'times', 'as', 'well', ""n't"", 'tv', 'movies', 'sad', 'standards', 'are', 'so', 'low', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'seen', 'major', 'talent', 'not', 'LAUGHING', 'WAY', 'TO', 'THE', 'BANK.If', '21', 'may', 'find', 'movie', 'be', 'great', 'wondeful', 'think', 'One', 'Night', 'Roxbury', 'very', 'funny', 'movie', 'then', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'However', 'like', 'really', 'laugh', 'then', 'think', 'movie', 'waste', 'time', 'Mr.', 'Ferrell', 'can', 'not', 'act', 'can', 'not', 'fathom', 'camp', 'more', 'likely', 'just', 'so', 'bad', 'actor', 'charecter', ""n't"", 'exist', 'way', 'why', 'give', 'movie', 'time', 'Rent', 'Handball', 'anything', 'else', 'matter']",N/A
