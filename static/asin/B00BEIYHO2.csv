Kinda reminds me EXACTLY of...Hmm...one wonders.I mean look at what can happen if government isnt given all powers to protect us all. Disillusioned and angry traitors are all about us..I mean remember back in the day when 'Murica was 'perfect' and was the envy of the universe and now with all the globalization, wall street bankers..and stuff.. look at what we have become, some have lost their faith and might do treasonous things and make pacts with our enemies and plot against us. No..no..I didnt mean to imply that we actually somewhat resemble a near militarized police state cloaked under a thin veneer of 'rights for all' democracy even with the guvment sweeping up all our private info, squeezing our civil liberties as tightly as they can muster while having secret laws, secret courts, secret prisons, secret secret...Nooooo...Watch this movie with that tattered flag, partial destruction of the white house, smashed phallic totem and those foreign TERRORISTS with their wiley tricks and ways to infiltrate the highest levels of government, all the way into the white-house with sharp implements, explosives, firearms-a-plenty and an endless supply of ammo and tactical gear, not to mention their stellar ability to mount Gatling guns on rooftops, in armored trash trucks and get a cargo plane gun ship to fly so close to the capital before it gets challenged and then subsequently is able to shoot a pair of the most technologically advanced fighter jets out of the sky. Dem terrorists sure are clever and sure are scary.No..just a good 'poppin' corn movie that like minded patriotic types can gather about and shower admiration, pride and praise at their honorable savvy, resourceful and kickass hero's. Who..by the way... Saved the day with GUNS...LOTS and LOTS and LOTS of GUNS..which a fellow generally cannot have in 'the district'..cos guns are dangerous and do not save lives...as we saw from the positive results of their negotiating skills. As we all know and readily collectively believe and tried fighting like hell earlier this year to assert, its absurd to believe ""to stop a bad guy with a gun, you need a good guy with a gun""..I sure hope nobody misread anything there in the movie because the 'gunplay' was just for emotional effect and excitement, probalbly why the last fight scene was with knives which also are outlawed for personal carry btw..so dont you all be going out buying OTF flick-blades longer than 2"" now.. guns BAD, guns BAD!! In real life this would have been resolved over earl grey tea and billiards.. Sheesh...all the critical reviews here..I must say, I quite liked it. Gerard went back to the gym and buffed up. Pres has a cute kid, Ashley Judd is still fetching, Cole Hauser is still a square-jawed stone cold bad-ass, Morgan Freeman is still lower-cased 'god'. We got a chance to see how advanced and hi-tech the operational command is, weaponry our armed forces have at their disposal (notice the hard core arms were ours), No AK-47's to be seen anywhere, all NATO type small arms..gotta love the MP5's, who doesnt.. Great stuff.4-stars..take one star away for that finger waggingly unnecessary ""making the monument get hit by a plane and fall like the North tower"" heart-string tugger...""- ""yes..give homeland security more power to protect us..dam our civil liberties..stop and frisk, infringement of 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, 6th and 8th amendments are directly under threat of being weakened, circumvented or disregarded..all in the name of national security. This movie reminds us that this ""war on terror"" continues on and we need to remain vigilant and patriotic, give them all the power and authority to protect the homeland at all costs, even it it includes giving up our own liberties.It's a fluff-piece that because it's so exciting, so ra-ra-ra, so ""my chest swells with pride"", so ""How dare those bastards take down our flag and throw it off the roof..bastards!"" I've gotta give it 4-stars.. I might even vote for 'the patriot act part deux if I don't come down from this high soon!Gawd bless America first before anyone else...right? This single-minded ""praise America"" piece is shown around the world right? Hmm...Wonder how the other global citizens feel about it or its relevance to them? Wonder how the British feel about being third in line for consultation after the Russians and Chinese? Maybe they need to wake up too...but I digress (again)... 4-stars...Olympus huh?...whew...no small ego there..

1627599,APZAJ6LGXH02F,B00BEIYHO2,Ace Reader,"[6, 8]","You want to watch a good action film worth your time and money? Well here it is! Director Antoine Fuqua has done a great job making one of this years superior crafted action films. This film beats out ""A Good Day To Die Hard"" and ""G.I. Joe: Retaliation"", easily. Finally Scottish actor, Gerard Butler has made a film that appealed to my tastes and it's very good on top of that. I haven't enjoyed anything this actor has been in since he starred in Director Zack Snyder's visually stunning ""300"" released way back in 2007. Similar to that film, Gerard Butler's character is ""preparing for glory"" in this entertaining and exciting action thriller that actually lives up to it's descriptions. Although not quite as violent as the film I mentioned, it is very violent in it's own way. It's hair-splittingly close. This time instead of Sparta fighting for her freedom, it's us (America), who is fighting to stop the bad guys who are trying to destroy us by taking away our rights, murdering our people and possibly blowing up our country. Gerard Butler's character is the hero who will stop them. Similarities aside, this film was enjoyable to watch and I recommended it to all Gerald Butler fans and action junkies. Go see it! You'll be pleasantly surprised. I was.

Gerard Butler is magnificent as Secret Service Agent Banning. The plot has been explained excellently in other reviews, and although their are some plot holes, the action is so unreal that the movie merits 5 stars from me.

1627643,A1DQEYIQ9FK3JL,B00BEIYHO2,"Asa Bunnett ""Verboseman""","[22, 30]","It's late afternoon in Washington DC, terrorists have taken the White House, and the body count is rising by the second.  Olympus Has Fallen certainly has an attention-grabbing premise, but more often than not fails to deliver on its potential.The film opens at the presidential retreat Camp David, where we are introduced to Mike Banning, a Secret Service agent and personal friend to the president's family.  While Olympus Has Fallen allows us to take a few minutes to get to know its cast, Director Antoine Fuqua's style lets no moment linger, and the film quickly propels into high gear.  While leaving Camp David, there is a major car accident that Banning fails to prevent, leading to the death of the First Lady, and his expulsion from the Secret Service.A year and a half later, Banning is now working at a desk job, which everyone in Hollywood knows is the least fulfilling avenue of work anyone could possibly choose.  He's clearly defeated and still depressed over his past failure, but his chance for redemption comes from an unlikely source - a full-scale terrorist attack on the most heavily defended building in the world.  In what is undoubtedly the film's best scene, terrorists both in the air and on the ground manage to breach the White House's defenses and hold the president hostage in his bunker, with Banning managing to trap himself inside the building as well.From here on out, it's a fairly typical Die Hard scenario - one man against everyone else in the building.  It sounds like it would work, it ought to work, but it unfortunately doesn't.  Where Die Hard's John McClane would more often than not barely escape an encounter with a bad guy without all his bones broken, Banning much more closely resembles a straight-up super soldier.  Any encounter with terrorists inevitably ends in their being beaten within seconds, which robs the film of a lot of its potential tension.  Frankly, the entire film loses tension simply because of how trigger-happy it is.  Rarely has a major film featured so many on-screen deaths, both of civilians and political figures.  After two straight hours of such wanton violence, it completely loses its impact.The acting is good, with several big names doing a great job, but the casting ultimately feels like the film is playing it safe.  Morgan Freeman plays Speaker of the House Allen Trumbull with a beleaguered demeanor that you would expect of someone forced to take the office of president during such a crisis.  Ultimately, though, it's basically the role we've come to expect of Freeman - no surprises here.  Aaron Eckhart plays the president, and again, it's a fairly predictable performance for anyone who remembers Eckhart as Harvey Dent in The Dark Knight.  Only Gerald Butler, who plays Banning, adds any sort of nuance to his role, and that's frequently just due to how convincing he is as a man seeking redemption for past failures.While Olympus Has Fallen is frequently fun, it often feels like a missed opportunity.  Despite its undoubtedly large budget, its A-list cast, and iconic location, it rarely rises to any higher level than ""average"".",3,Olympus is Callin' It Quits,1366588800,"04 22, 2013",2013,3124,"['late', 'afternoon', 'Washington', 'DC', 'terrorists', 'have', 'taken', 'White', 'House', 'body', 'count', 'rising', 'second', 'Olympus', 'Has', 'Fallen', 'certainly', 'attention-grabbing', 'premise', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'fails', 'deliver', 'potential.The', 'film', 'presidential', 'retreat', 'Camp', 'David', 'where', 'are', 'introduced', 'Mike', 'Banning', 'Secret', 'Service', 'agent', 'personal', 'friend', 'president', 'family', 'Olympus', 'Has', 'Fallen', 'take', 'few', 'minutes', 'get', 'know', 'cast', 'Director', 'Antoine', 'Fuqua', 'style', 'moment', 'linger', 'film', 'quickly', 'high', 'gear', 'leaving', 'Camp', 'David', 'major', 'car', 'accident', 'Banning', 'fails', 'prevent', 'leading', 'death', 'First', 'Lady', 'expulsion', 'Secret', 'Service.A', 'year', 'half', 'later', 'Banning', 'now', 'working', 'desk', 'job', 'everyone', 'Hollywood', 'knows', 'least', 'fulfilling', 'avenue', 'work', 'anyone', 'could', 'possibly', 'choose', 'clearly', 'defeated', 'still', 'depressed', 'past', 'failure', 'chance', 'redemption', 'unlikely', 'source', 'full-scale', 'terrorist', 'attack', 'most', 'heavily', 'defended', 'building', 'world', 'what', 'undoubtedly', 'film', 'best', 'scene', 'air', 'ground', 'manage', 'breach', 'White', 'House', 'defenses', 'hold', 'president', 'hostage', 'bunker', 'Banning', 'managing', 'trap', 'building', 'well.From', 'here', 'out', 'fairly', 'typical', 'Die', 'Hard', 'scenario', 'one', 'man', 'everyone', 'else', 'building', 'would', 'work', 'ought', 'work', 'unfortunately', ""n't"", 'Where', 'Die', 'Hard', 'John', 'McClane', 'would', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'barely', 'escape', 'encounter', 'bad', 'guy', 'bones', 'broken', 'Banning', 'much', 'more', 'closely', 'straight-up', 'super', 'soldier', 'encounter', 'terrorists', 'inevitably', 'being', 'beaten', 'seconds', 'robs', 'film', 'lot', 'potential', 'tension', 'Frankly', 'entire', 'film', 'tension', 'simply', 'how', 'trigger-happy', 'Rarely', 'major', 'film', 'featured', 'so', 'many', 'on-screen', 'deaths', 'civilians', 'political', 'figures', 'two', 'straight', 'hours', 'such', 'wanton', 'violence', 'completely', 'impact.The', 'acting', 'good', 'several', 'big', 'names', 'doing', 'great', 'job', 'casting', 'ultimately', 'film', 'playing', 'safe', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Speaker', 'House', 'Allen', 'Trumbull', 'beleaguered', 'demeanor', 'would', 'expect', 'someone', 'forced', 'take', 'office', 'president', 'crisis', 'Ultimately', 'basically', 'role', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'Freeman', 'surprises', 'here', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'president', 'again', 'fairly', 'predictable', 'performance', 'anyone', 'who', 'Eckhart', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Only', 'Gerald', 'Butler', 'who', 'Banning', 'sort', 'nuance', 'role', 'frequently', 'just', 'due', 'how', 'convincing', 'man', 'seeking', 'redemption', 'past', 'failures.While', 'Olympus', 'Has', 'Fallen', 'frequently', 'fun', 'often', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'undoubtedly', 'large', 'budget', 'A-list', 'cast', 'iconic', 'location', 'rarely', 'higher', 'level', 'average']",N/A

1627681,A6WZVL0SRQAPY,B00BEIYHO2,Brian Driver,"[2, 5]","NO SPOILERS!!See ""Olympus Has Fallen"" if you likedDie Hard.  The same withUnder Siege:if you enjoyed that movie, you'll probably like this one. Because, after all, ""Olympus"" IS that kind of movie - it is EXACTLY what you think it is...a rollicking, smash-mouth, loud and body-strewn extravaganza, albeit without any real jaw-clenching suspense.Why?  Well, you've seen it before.  It's really the same kind of movie: great special effects, lots of action...which is both its asset and its problem. It's fun, it's Big Budget, it's exciting...and it's pretty predictable.Gerard Butler plays Mike Banning, a superb Secret Service agent who had the bad luck of being the right guy for the right job when it came to protecting the President Asher (Aaron Eckhart), making the right decision, and acting precisely as he should - and for it he was bounced off the Presidential personal protection detail.  It's a tough break, one he relives constantly - a la Clint Eastwood's character inIn The Line Of Fire-  but here he is, pushing bureaucratic pens across bureaucratic forms, and despising his bureaucratic job.  He yearns for the chance to get into the action again, especially when he runs into his old friends on the Presidential squad.But Change is coming with capital C in the form of a Korean madman and his eminently well prepared squad of miscreants.  And when they do come, they come with EVERYTHING.As I've said before, what follows is a derivative trope - and Bruce Willis, Steven Seagal and others have done it before, and with better scripts.  But we can now add Gerard Butler to the list; he's confident and effective in the role of a brawny AND brainy patriotic hero.As an adventure flick, I think ""Olympus"" does an equitable job, and director Antoine Fuqua (Training Day,King Arthur) deserves accolades: the special effects are spectacular, and seamless.  If you live near D.C., as I do, you can see that the White House used here is being stood in for by another building -- ?? but the effects are still handled masterfully.For the most part the acting is solid, too: Morgan Freeman is, as always, perfect as Speaker of the House Allan Trumbull, the man who is reluctantly forced into the role of Acting President once the President and Vice-President are taken hostage.  There should be some kind of anointed position for Freeman within our national framework, as he seems somehow to always embody the personage of calm and assurance we need in times of crisis.As for the other roles, Cole Houser is getting good work lately in secondary parts - here he plays Agent Roma - who appears to head the Secret Service detail - and I look forward to seeing him play a lead role in the not-too-distant future.  And, while Eckhart has the face of a President, the part written for him was highly faulted; he makes decisions (granted, under stress) that I hope NO President would EVER make. He seemed less formidable than I have seen him before, most notably inBattle: Los Angeles [Blu-ray].The only problem with the movie, I felt, was the script, which did not try awfully hard to escape the genre.  One can point over and over to scenes which seemed almost word-for-word rewrites of other films in the genre, and they made the movie rather predictable.  One scene was lifted right from the first ""Die Hard,"" in which Butler seems to have been taken in by a traitor's well-acted subterfuge. Therefore, I knew exactly how and when Butler would figure it all out.There are other problems, too: Banning has been outside the White House detail for 18 months, yet he knows all the codes. And some early scenes were far too ""chummy"" between Banning, the President, and their son.  It seemed too, well, cliched.Still, ""Olympus Has Fallen"" is exactly the right kind of movie for its audience.  If you want a fun, action-packed spectacular that delivers what it promises, this is the movie for you.  In fact, I feel ""Olympus"" does much better than its recent counterpartA Good Day to Die Hard, a formula-driven sequel that seemed stale and tired in comparison.  Not so here: ""Olympus"" is a bright and exciting adventure film that is gratifying and rousing, the kind of patriotic rabble-rouser that doesn't flinch from delivering the goods.Speaking of which, the night I saw the movie there were sitting near me people of several different ethnicities, and I was happy to hear them enjoying the movie right alongside me.  I thought that spoke volumes of what the White House represents, and that the American people are a varied but grateful population.  This was as reassuring as the movie itself, and it did my heart good to experience it.",4,"The Butler Did It...and So Did Willis, Seagal, Eastwood, Ford...",1364169600,"03 25, 2013",2013,4634,"['SPOILERS', 'See', 'Olympus', 'Has', 'Fallen', 'likedDie', 'Hard', 'same', 'withUnder', 'Siege', 'enjoyed', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'one', 'Olympus', 'kind', 'movie', 'EXACTLY', 'what', 'think', 'rollicking', 'smash-mouth', 'loud', 'body-strewn', 'extravaganza', 'real', 'jaw-clenching', 'suspense.Why', 'Well', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'really', 'same', 'kind', 'movie', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'lots', 'action', 'asset', 'problem', 'fun', 'Big', 'Budget', 'exciting', 'pretty', 'predictable.Gerard', 'Butler', 'Mike', 'Banning', 'superb', 'Secret', 'Service', 'agent', 'who', 'had', 'bad', 'luck', 'being', 'right', 'guy', 'right', 'job', 'when', 'came', 'protecting', 'President', 'Asher', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'making', 'right', 'decision', 'acting', 'precisely', 'should', 'was', 'bounced', 'off', 'Presidential', 'personal', 'protection', 'detail', 'tough', 'break', 'one', 'constantly', 'la', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'character', 'inIn', 'Line', 'Fire-', 'here', 'pushing', 'bureaucratic', 'pens', 'bureaucratic', 'forms', 'despising', 'bureaucratic', 'job', 'chance', 'get', 'action', 'again', 'especially', 'when', 'old', 'friends', 'Presidential', 'squad.But', 'Change', 'coming', 'capital', 'C', 'form', 'Korean', 'madman', 'eminently', 'well', 'prepared', 'squad', 'miscreants', 'when', 'do', 'come', 'come', 'EVERYTHING.As', ""'ve"", 'said', 'what', 'derivative', 'trope', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'others', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'scripts', 'can', 'now', 'add', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'list', 'confident', 'effective', 'role', 'brawny', 'AND', 'patriotic', 'hero.As', 'adventure', 'flick', 'think', 'Olympus', 'equitable', 'job', 'director', 'Antoine', 'Fuqua', 'Training', 'Day', 'King', 'Arthur', 'accolades', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'spectacular', 'seamless', 'live', 'D.C.', 'do', 'can', 'see', 'White', 'House', 'used', 'here', 'being', 'stood', 'building', 'effects', 'are', 'still', 'handled', 'masterfully.For', 'most', 'part', 'acting', 'solid', 'too', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'always', 'perfect', 'Speaker', 'House', 'Allan', 'Trumbull', 'man', 'who', 'reluctantly', 'forced', 'role', 'Acting', 'President', 'once', 'President', 'Vice-President', 'are', 'taken', 'hostage', 'should', 'be', 'kind', 'anointed', 'position', 'Freeman', 'national', 'framework', 'somehow', 'always', 'embody', 'personage', 'calm', 'assurance', 'need', 'times', 'crisis.As', 'other', 'roles', 'Cole', 'Houser', 'getting', 'good', 'work', 'lately', 'secondary', 'parts', 'here', 'Agent', 'Roma', 'who', 'head', 'Secret', 'Service', 'detail', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'play', 'lead', 'role', 'not-too-distant', 'future', 'Eckhart', 'face', 'President', 'part', 'written', 'was', 'highly', 'faulted', 'decisions', 'granted', 'stress', 'hope', 'President', 'would', 'EVER', 'make', 'seemed', 'less', 'formidable', 'have', 'seen', 'before', 'most', 'notably', 'inBattle', 'Los', 'Angeles', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', '.The', 'only', 'problem', 'movie', 'felt', 'was', 'script', 'did', 'not', 'try', 'awfully', 'hard', 'escape', 'genre', 'One', 'can', 'point', 'over', 'scenes', 'seemed', 'almost', 'word-for-word', 'rewrites', 'other', 'films', 'genre', 'made', 'movie', 'rather', 'predictable', 'One', 'scene', 'was', 'lifted', 'right', 'first', 'Die', 'Hard', 'Butler', 'have', 'been', 'taken', 'traitor', 'well-acted', 'subterfuge', 'Therefore', 'knew', 'exactly', 'how', 'when', 'Butler', 'would', 'figure', 'are', 'other', 'problems', 'too', 'Banning', 'been', 'White', 'House', 'detail', '18', 'months', 'yet', 'codes', 'early', 'scenes', 'were', 'far', 'too', 'chummy', 'Banning', 'President', 'son', 'seemed', 'too', 'well', 'cliched.Still', 'Olympus', 'Has', 'Fallen', 'exactly', 'right', 'kind', 'movie', 'audience', 'want', 'fun', 'action-packed', 'spectacular', 'what', 'movie', 'fact', 'feel', 'Olympus', 'much', 'better', 'recent', 'counterpartA', 'Good', 'Day', 'Die', 'Hard', 'formula-driven', 'sequel', 'seemed', 'stale', 'tired', 'comparison', 'Not', 'so', 'here', 'Olympus', 'bright', 'exciting', 'adventure', 'film', 'gratifying', 'rousing', 'kind', 'patriotic', 'rabble-rouser', ""n't"", 'flinch', 'delivering', 'goods.Speaking', 'night', 'saw', 'movie', 'were', 'sitting', 'people', 'several', 'different', 'ethnicities', 'was', 'happy', 'hear', 'enjoying', 'movie', 'right', 'thought', 'spoke', 'volumes', 'what', 'White', 'House', 'American', 'people', 'are', 'varied', 'grateful', 'population', 'was', 'as', 'reassuring', 'movie', 'did', 'heart', 'good', 'experience']",N/A

A limousine accident Banning was in with the first lady...an accident that claimed the first lady's life and left the President single and the ""first kid"" without a mother.Now, eighteen months have passed, and a civil war is being fought in Korea, American troops fighting the war in Korea's Peninsula. The war is necessary, but nobody likes war, do they (well, almost nobody!)? This leads to President Asher having a meeting with South Korea's prime minister, Lee Tae-Woo (Keong Sim).The result proves to be disastrous when a North Korean terrorist named Kang Yeonsak (Yune), disguised as a South Korean ministerial aide, takes complete control over the White House, holding President Asher and all of his cabinet hostage. At the very last minute, House Speaker Martin Trumbull (Freeman) must become the (acting) President and make many stressful decisions...all of which he isn't prepared to make! And, from inside the White House, there is only one hope for survival: Mike Banning himself.What you have here, folks, is a film that mirrors Die Hard in many, many ways...yet follows its own path. Gerard Butler makes John McClane into his very own character (Mike Banning), and powerfully shifts from suspense into humor, and from humor into suspense! Freeman, with his Academy Award-winning and nominated talent, who ""makes acting look so easy,"" as a friend of mine likes to say-takes the drama of Olympus Has Fallen and creates into complete reality. Freeman knows the film's situation; he understand's the film's situation; and from there on out,he brings the film to life. You can really feel his character's pressure and stress, as you can with all of the characters, really. Butler and Freeman certainly steal the show, but Olympus Has Fallen couldn't have been made without the other acclaimed actors standing next to them. The film stands out as powerful action, drama, and comedy-all at the same time-thanks to these actors and to Antoine Fuqua as well!There are some people who may say that Olympus Has Fallen is ""too unrealistic,"" and other people who say that it's inappropriate subject matter given what America has been through in the last twelve years. Below I leave my feedback in response to these two criticisms (which I've actually heard come from peoples' mouths):Olympus Has Fallen is, like Die Hard, a film with a story and a sequence of events that actually could happen. However, in real life; things would not be as straightforward as they appaer to be in the film; rather; it would take a few days/nights for everything to be resolved. It certainly would be interesting to see it as it really would happen, but wouldn't that make us rebut our argument of disturbance? Plus, would we really want to see a film that took that long to come to a conclusion?As for the ""argument of disturbance,"" I will say this: even in the midst of the drama and the action (entertaining action that could be seen as disturbing at the same time); there is GREAT comedy, the same comedy that made us fall in love with both Die Hard and its hero of John McClane. And, to top it all off; the ending is not only very happy, but also very glorious in the glorification of America and her power!:-)Highly recommended!P.S.

Why is it that NOT A SINGLE AGENCY has a clue that this has happened and notified all concerned interests? Also, there are usually weeks or months of planning and preparation before a dignitary from another nation is brought to the White House. How the hell did a small platoon of heavily armed Asians get that close to the White House without being spotted by secret service? And were there no bomb-sniffing dogs within 100 miles of DC? And how did a known terrorist just waltz in posing as security? Then after the platoon effortlessly mows down ALL of the White House security all of a sudden they can't take down ONE guy who is trapped inside the White House and is badly out-manned and out-gunned? There are many more issues for sure but I could go on forever. A thought occurred to me while writing this review. Maybe real life has more interesting plot lines than what an out of touch Hollywood writer can come up with. Most of us real world people are no longer impressed by these unrealistic scenarios. Why not just make a movie with real life scenarios?

1627725,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B00BEIYHO2,Chris Kennison,"[4, 6]","Antoine Fuqua has been one of those directors that shined bright and early with a movie like ""Training Day"" that was nominated for Oscars and acknowledgements, and then he sort of went into mediocre land. Now with ""Olympus has Fallen"" many are saying that he has finally done something worth watching again. Here's my opinion on that matter.""Olympus has Fallen"" immediately inserts you into the lives of Secret Service Agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) and President of the United States Benjamin Asher (Aaron Eckhart). Immediately you see that Fuqua has achieved a realistic portrayal of life with the American President in an age of random shootings, terrorists and thriving dictator leadership. Banning has his work cut out for him. Fuqua has done his homework and the behind the scenes with the President feel works fantasically.As if the screenwriter made adjustments to this movie just two weeks ago (impossible), we find the President preparing for a vital war-avoiding meeting with the South Koreans at the White House. Little do they know that the North Koreans have planned an aggressive and brazen attack on the White House and they come fast and hard.In a way, ""Olympus has Fallen"" is a lot of what we've seen before in action movies, but never have we seen such a shocking attack on our nations most precious house. Many will say that this attack is unrealistic and impossible, but as we've all seen in recent years, the impossible and shocking shows up on our news on a weekly/monthly basis. Anyway, if you erase all those preconceived notions, you should be able to just sit back and enjoy a pretty intense action film.There are lots of twists and double-crosses in ""Olympus has Fallen"" and it adds to the tension. Although the personal connection we feel to the characters is the movies best asset. ""Olympus"" is no ""Die Hard"", but it is a better film then all of its predecessors. Some of the effects in ""Olympus"" are less than great, but when a good story is being told, effects can be forgiven. Butler is effective as a former Army Ranger. In fact, this may be Butler's saving grace after receiving poor review after poor review for his previous films.""Olympus has Fallen"" is a good action film that mostly takes place inside the White House and makes the most out of every antiquities destruction. It is certainly a fun trip to the movies that will have you glued to the screen the entire time.

There is one common theme throughout the entire movie that I think is realistic--that our government and military SOMETIMES are so pompous and arrogant that they sacrifice themselves and others rather than to swallow their pride and do the right thing, whatever that right thing is.  Of course, that's just my opinion.  I didn't think any one actor stood out as being fantastic.  I am a Butler fan, tho, for his role in GAMER.  I thot he did a great job there.  Anyway, this movie is worth watching once, at least.  I really think this movie was a recycling of an old idea (see below), and was engineered to get a bunch of older actors some work.SCROLL DOWN FOR SPOILER*** partial SPOILER ***First, let me say I'm not Secret Service or ever intend to be, so I don't know the exact protocol, but I don't think the President, his wife, his son, and his most trusted Secret Service would go out in a wicked snowstorm like they did at the beginning of the movie.  Next, I find it hard to believe that our President would take Koreans into the bunker at the White House.  Most likely, they would go to an area separate from the President and his family and high-end officials.  Next, I doubt the President would tell Admiral what's-his-name to give out his Cerebrus code.  The same goes for his Secretary of Defense (or whatever she was).  The pompousness on the part of the President was that he said, ""oh, they'll never get my code"", so you 2 can go ahead and give him your code.  Total BS, in my opinion.  We do not (or should not) negotiate with terrorists.  They are never to be trusted, duh...  Their intent was to kill off all or most of the hostages, anyway.  Also, that the General sent in 5 or 6 SEAL teams to their deaths was really stupid.  He's got a guy on the inside who is telling him to hold on for a few minutes while the situation gets checked out.  Most people in their right mind would not sacrifice several teams of the most highly trained operators just because of pride and arrogance, but SOMETIMES they might.  This movie reminds me a lot of Steven Seagal's Under Seige, except that was a battleship with Tomahawks on it.  Great movie, btw, from about 20 years ago, lol.  So, this is just a recycling of old ideas for people in the next ""generation"" who never watched Under Seige or anything like it.  Also, to remove 25,000+ troops and the 7th Fleet from a ""peace-keeping"" duty most likely would not happen.  I'm thinking the President or Speaker would not risk the lives of those people we were there to protect, but you never know...  I am aware that people in positions of authority sometimes have to make tough decisions that turn out to be bad decisions.  I just felt like a lot of people were making bad decision after bad decision in this movie.  That's Hollywood for ya, lol.  I watched it, tho, and I would watch it again somtime when in the mood.",3,Olympus Has Fallen - with spoiler,1376438400,"08 14, 2013",2013,3092,"['must', 'say', 'love', 'action', 'special', 'effects', 'stuff', 'blowing', 'up', 'most', 'story', 'line', 'movie', 'only', '3', 'stars', 'are', 'several', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'happen', 'real', 'life', 'one', 'common', 'theme', 'entire', 'movie', 'think', 'realistic', 'government', 'military', 'SOMETIMES', 'are', 'so', 'pompous', 'arrogant', 'sacrifice', 'others', 'rather', 'swallow', 'pride', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'that', 'right', 'thing', 'course', 'just', 'opinion', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'one', 'actor', 'stood', 'out', 'being', 'fantastic', 'am', 'Butler', 'fan', 'tho', 'role', 'GAMER', 'thot', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'there', 'Anyway', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'once', 'least', 'really', 'think', 'movie', 'was', 'recycling', 'old', 'idea', 'see', 'was', 'engineered', 'get', 'bunch', 'older', 'actors', 'work.SCROLL', 'DOWN', 'FOR', 'SPOILER***', 'partial', 'SPOILER', '***First', 'let', 'say', ""'m"", 'not', 'Secret', 'Service', 'ever', 'intend', 'be', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'exact', 'protocol', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'President', 'wife', 'son', 'most', 'trusted', 'Secret', 'Service', 'would', 'go', 'out', 'wicked', 'snowstorm', 'did', 'beginning', 'movie', 'Next', 'find', 'hard', 'believe', 'President', 'would', 'take', 'Koreans', 'bunker', 'White', 'House', 'Most', 'likely', 'would', 'go', 'area', 'separate', 'President', 'family', 'high-end', 'officials', 'Next', 'doubt', 'President', 'would', 'tell', 'Admiral', ""what's-his-name"", 'give', 'out', 'Cerebrus', 'code', 'same', 'Secretary', 'Defense', 'was', 'pompousness', 'part', 'President', 'was', 'said', 'oh', ""'ll"", 'never', 'get', 'code', '2', 'can', 'go', 'ahead', 'give', 'code', 'Total', 'BS', 'opinion', 'do', 'not', 'should', 'not', 'negotiate', 'terrorists', 'are', 'never', 'be', 'trusted', 'duh', 'intent', 'was', 'kill', 'off', 'most', 'hostages', 'anyway', 'Also', 'General', 'sent', '5', '6', 'SEAL', 'teams', 'deaths', 'was', 'really', 'stupid', 'got', 'guy', 'inside', 'who', 'telling', 'hold', 'few', 'minutes', 'situation', 'checked', 'out', 'Most', 'people', 'right', 'mind', 'would', 'not', 'sacrifice', 'several', 'teams', 'most', 'highly', 'trained', 'operators', 'just', 'pride', 'arrogance', 'SOMETIMES', 'might', 'movie', 'lot', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'Seige', 'was', 'battleship', 'Tomahawks', 'Great', 'movie', 'btw', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'lol', 'So', 'just', 'recycling', 'old', 'ideas', 'people', 'next', 'generation', 'who', 'never', 'watched', 'Seige', 'anything', 'Also', 'remove', '25,000+', 'troops', '7th', 'Fleet', 'peace-keeping', 'duty', 'most', 'likely', 'would', 'not', 'happen', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'President', 'Speaker', 'would', 'not', 'risk', 'lives', 'people', 'were', 'there', 'protect', 'never', 'know', 'am', 'aware', 'people', 'positions', 'authority', 'sometimes', 'have', 'make', 'tough', 'decisions', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'bad', 'decisions', 'just', 'felt', 'lot', 'people', 'were', 'making', 'bad', 'decision', 'bad', 'decision', 'movie', 'Hollywood', 'ya', 'lol', 'watched', 'tho', 'would', 'watch', 'again', 'somtime', 'when', 'mood']",N/A

Its essentially an over-top shoot-em-up flick with moments of such over-the-top violence that I began to wonder why in the world I was watching it. The plot is essentially like that of the original Die Hard film. Instead of a multi-national corporation, the victims are the White House, and the hostages include the President, the Secretary State and the Head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Pentagon.The movie parallels the original Die Hard not just in terms of plot but also in many scenes. In the original Die Hard, the baddies were Germans. In this offering they are North Koreans. The baddies infiltrate the White House using such state of the art equipment and finesse that anyone in charge of some kind of military operation would be highly envious. In about the time it takes to order a hamburger and shake from your favorite fast food restaurant, the North Koreans have brought the White House to its knees and are holding the top brass hostage. And why? They want the US's nuclear launch codes to start World War III.Gerard Butler plays Mike Banning, a sort of John McClaine-like Secret Service Agent who just happened to be removed from the White House when all the fun begins. He then infiltrates the battered White House, moving among the Oval Office and other areas which appear like the remnants of a place long since abandoned centuries earlier. The film is mostly about him, in true John McClaine-like fashion, trying to free the hostages and doing to the baddies what was done to the White House. His contact is the Speaker of the House, played by Morgan Freeman, and other members of the government who were luckily not at the White House when it became the equivalent of a building in a Post-Apocalyptic world. In a particularly vicious scene, the Secretary of Defense, played by Mellissa Leo, is beaten to a pulp by the baddies.Overall a horrid movie with so much gratuitous violence that some scenes I just didn't want to watch. If you like pure shoot-em-up where no less then 679 people get killed or hurt, this is certainly the film for you. The original Die Hard film certainly had violence, but it also had plot, pacing, and a certain amount of character development. There are even moments of humor.

1627751,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B00BEIYHO2,C. Sawin,"[8, 18]","Gerard Butler plays Presidential Guard and Secret Service agent Mike Banning in the action thriller ""Olympus Has Fallen."" After the president loses his wife to a car accident, Mike walks away from the job. 18 months pass and Mike is now on Presidential Detail with a desk job and misses his old life. As Mike trudges his way through another boring work day the White House is attacked by terrorists and a North Korean criminal mastermind now holds the President hostage. With the fate of the entire country at stake, Mike works with Speaker Trumbull (Morgan Freeman) and national security to not only save the President but also return the reigns of the country to whom they properly belong to.Even early on, you can calculate the conclusions to certain key scenes in ""Olympus Has Fallen."" A bunch of cars driving in extremely snowy conditions can really only go a couple of ways. What's more surprising is that Ashley Judd shows up for so little screen time. You pretty much know how the movie will end going in, as well. America isn't about to let terrorism win in anything; not even movies. But there's still a little bit of something there to be offered even to the most cynical individual.Gerard Butler's Mike Banning is pretty smart-mouthed and isn't afraid to be blunt. He pretty much follows in the footsteps of John McClane. Every fight scene he has is really raw and massively bloody. The entire White House takeover sequence contains the majority of the mayhem in the film and it doesn't disappoint in that aspect. Bullets fly, cars erupt in a ball of flame, windows explode, and a lot of innocent people die. The destruction and carnage isn't the issue. It's how familiar and borrowed everything else feels.The cast is certainly remarkable on paper, so maybe that's one of the reasons the film leaves a sour taste in your mouth for not being as solid as it should be. Aaron Eckhart portrays a kidnapped President Benjamin Asher, Dylan McDermott slides into the smarmy shoes of Dave Forbes with ease, Melissa Leo as the tenacious Secretary of Defense Ruth McMillan, Cole Hauser as fellow Secret Service agent Roma, and Radha Mitchell as Mike's wife Leah who's also a nurse. Most of these actors, aside from maybe Butler, Eckhart, and Freeman, are grossly underutilized and feel like they're wasted, but then again ""Olympus Has Fallen"" is basically nothing but wasted potential.One of the only unique concepts in the film is its ridiculous use of the Pledge of Allegiance. The scene it's used in is so absurdly funny that it'll probably come to mind every time somebody brings it up. Mike dodging and outrunning a crashing helicopter is something straight out of one of ""The Expendables"" films. The terrorist's end game plan would make for a more interesting concept than what was used in ""Olympus Has Fallen"" if something like ""The Twilight Zone"" got a hold of it and the story took place after this particular plan was executed. Seeing writers and directors attempt to pick up the pieces of something of that magnitude isn't exactly groundbreaking, but it at least it isn't as much of a tiresome idea as the United States being taken over by terrorists.Imagine grounding ""Air Force One"" and scaling it back to The White House, giving it the story of ""Die Hard"" with the laughable characters and ridiculous screenplay of the ""Red Dawn"" remake and sprinkling it with bits of ""Law Abiding Citizen"" and you get ""Olympus Has Fallen."" Take away its swift kicks, severe stabbings, big explosions, and gory headshots and ""Olympus Has Fallen"" is just another cookie cutter action film with stale writing.",2,Stained with the blood of a familiar disaster,1363651200,"03 19, 2013",2013,3607,"['Gerard', 'Butler', 'Presidential', 'Guard', 'Secret', 'Service', 'agent', 'Mike', 'Banning', 'action', 'thriller', 'Olympus', 'Has', 'Fallen', 'president', 'wife', 'car', 'accident', 'Mike', 'away', 'job', '18', 'months', 'pass', 'Mike', 'now', 'Presidential', 'Detail', 'desk', 'job', 'old', 'life', 'Mike', 'way', 'boring', 'work', 'day', 'White', 'House', 'attacked', 'terrorists', 'North', 'Korean', 'criminal', 'mastermind', 'now', 'President', 'hostage', 'fate', 'entire', 'country', 'stake', 'Mike', 'Speaker', 'Trumbull', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'national', 'security', 'not', 'only', 'save', 'President', 'also', 'return', 'reigns', 'country', 'whom', 'properly', 'belong', 'to.Even', 'early', 'can', 'calculate', 'conclusions', 'certain', 'key', 'scenes', 'Olympus', 'Has', 'Fallen', 'bunch', 'cars', 'driving', 'extremely', 'snowy', 'conditions', 'can', 'really', 'only', 'go', 'couple', 'ways', 'What', 'more', 'surprising', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'up', 'so', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'pretty', 'much', 'know', 'how', 'movie', 'will', 'end', 'going', 'well', 'America', ""n't"", 'about', 'let', 'terrorism', 'win', 'anything', 'not', 'even', 'movies', 'still', 'little', 'bit', 'something', 'be', 'offered', 'even', 'most', 'cynical', 'individual.Gerard', 'Butler', 'Mike', 'Banning', 'pretty', 'smart-mouthed', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'be', 'blunt', 'pretty', 'much', 'footsteps', 'John', 'McClane', 'Every', 'fight', 'scene', 'really', 'raw', 'massively', 'bloody', 'entire', 'White', 'House', 'takeover', 'sequence', 'majority', 'mayhem', 'film', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'aspect', 'Bullets', 'fly', 'cars', 'erupt', 'ball', 'flame', 'explode', 'lot', 'innocent', 'people', 'die', 'destruction', 'carnage', ""n't"", 'issue', 'how', 'familiar', 'borrowed', 'everything', 'else', 'feels.The', 'cast', 'certainly', 'remarkable', 'paper', 'so', 'maybe', 'one', 'reasons', 'film', 'sour', 'taste', 'mouth', 'not', 'being', 'as', 'solid', 'should', 'be', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'kidnapped', 'President', 'Benjamin', 'Asher', 'Dylan', 'McDermott', 'smarmy', 'shoes', 'Dave', 'Forbes', 'ease', 'Melissa', 'Leo', 'tenacious', 'Secretary', 'Defense', 'Ruth', 'McMillan', 'Cole', 'Hauser', 'fellow', 'Secret', 'Service', 'agent', 'Roma', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', 'Mike', 'wife', 'Leah', 'who', 'also', 'nurse', 'Most', 'actors', 'aside', 'maybe', 'Butler', 'Eckhart', 'Freeman', 'are', 'grossly', 'underutilized', 'feel', ""'re"", 'wasted', 'then', 'again', 'Olympus', 'Has', 'Fallen', 'basically', 'nothing', 'wasted', 'potential.One', 'only', 'unique', 'concepts', 'film', 'ridiculous', 'use', 'Pledge', 'Allegiance', 'scene', 'used', 'so', 'absurdly', 'funny', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'come', 'mind', 'time', 'somebody', 'up', 'dodging', 'outrunning', 'crashing', 'helicopter', 'something', 'straight', 'one', 'Expendables', 'films', 'terrorist', 'end', 'game', 'plan', 'would', 'make', 'more', 'interesting', 'concept', 'what', 'was', 'used', 'Olympus', 'Has', 'Fallen', 'something', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'got', 'hold', 'story', 'took', 'place', 'particular', 'plan', 'was', 'executed', 'Seeing', 'writers', 'directors', 'attempt', 'pick', 'up', 'pieces', 'something', 'magnitude', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'groundbreaking', 'least', ""n't"", 'as', 'much', 'tiresome', 'idea', 'United', 'States', 'being', 'taken', 'over', 'terrorists.Imagine', 'grounding', 'Air', 'Force', 'One', 'scaling', 'back', 'White', 'House', 'giving', 'story', 'Die', 'Hard', 'laughable', 'characters', 'ridiculous', 'screenplay', 'Red', 'Dawn', 'remake', 'sprinkling', 'bits', 'Law', 'Abiding', 'Citizen', 'get', 'Olympus', 'Has', 'Fallen', 'Take', 'away', 'swift', 'kicks', 'severe', 'stabbings', 'big', 'explosions', 'gory', 'headshots', 'Olympus', 'Has', 'Fallen', 'just', 'cookie', 'cutter', 'action', 'film', 'stale', 'writing']",N/A

This is just an all out war. Gerard Butler is the typical, unstoppable, calm-cool-and-collected tough guy, and does a good job of portraying that character.  The lead bad guy was great also.

If you don't agree, state why - it's the only way to help people make the best decision.Olympus Has Fallen (2013) - Gerard Butler, Aaron Eckhart, Ashley Judd, Morgan Freeman, Dylan McDermott, Angela Bassett, Robert Forster, Cole Hauser, Finley Jacobsen, Melissa Leo, Radha Mitchell, Rick YunePremise: When a North Korean terrorist group launch an all out assault on the White House, a disgraced Secret Service Agent, Mike Banning (Gerard Butler), must rise to the occasion to rescue the President (Aaron Eckhart) from his captor before the Mad Man gains access to a secret nuclear program called ""Cerberus"".Thoughts: Olympus Has Fallen is one of 2013's two ""Die Hard In The White House"" entries (the other being the upcoming White House Down). Unfortunately, it sets the bar quite low. While Gerard Butler gives a really enjoyable performance in an action hero role, his choice of vehicle was questionable. Without giving too much away, the internal logic of the film is FUBAR'd from the word ""Go."" The characters behave not as characters but what is most convenient to the plot - instead of providing us with competent villains, the writers gave us stupid ones. Additionally, their actions - as terrorists - do not make sense. The biggest offender of the internal logic problem, however, is the president in regards to scenes where his staff is tortured - if you watch the movie you will instantly catch on to what I am referring (hint: if you can't stand seeing your staff get put through the ringer, what do you think a terrorist is going to do to get you to comply to his plan? Genius.) While the direction, overall, is solid - the main detractors here are story choice and visuals: the key determinants in why would want to pay to see this movie.Should you buy this movie? Absolutely not. For one thing, the film looks cheap. In their race to beat ""White House Down"" to the market, the producers cut corners which is obvious in any scene involving CGI (and the fact that White House looks absolutely nothing like the real White House - to the point where it is more of a distraction). The Story is a mess and characters show up at random places when it makes no logical sense for them to be on the scene (Banning's Girlfriend in the final scene of the film).Should you rent this movie? Yea, if you're the kind of person who enjoys mindless entertainment (not saying that in a bad way - after all, I did watch and enjoy the film for what it was) then this is definitely worth a one off rental. It's enjoyable to see Gerard Butler return to the genre that made him famous but it lacks all the merits it needs for ownership. It's a solid action movie that doesn't take itself too seriously.",3,You Get What You Pay For,1367020800,"04 27, 2013",2013,2868,"['EDIT', 'are', 'marking', 'review', 'unhelpful', 'please', 'state', 'why', 'comments', 'absolutely', 'stand', 'fact', 'film', 'NOT', 'owning', 'may', 'be', 'rental', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'state', 'why', 'only', 'way', 'help', 'people', 'make', 'best', 'decision.Olympus', 'Has', 'Fallen', '2013', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Dylan', 'McDermott', 'Angela', 'Bassett', 'Robert', 'Forster', 'Cole', 'Hauser', 'Finley', 'Jacobsen', 'Melissa', 'Leo', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', 'Rick', 'YunePremise', 'When', 'North', 'Korean', 'terrorist', 'group', 'launch', 'out', 'assault', 'White', 'House', 'disgraced', 'Secret', 'Service', 'Agent', 'Mike', 'Banning', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'must', 'rise', 'occasion', 'rescue', 'President', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'captor', 'Mad', 'Man', 'gains', 'access', 'secret', 'nuclear', 'program', 'called', 'Cerberus', '.Thoughts', 'Olympus', 'Has', 'Fallen', 'one', '2013', 'two', 'Die', 'Hard', 'White', 'House', 'entries', 'other', 'being', 'upcoming', 'White', 'House', 'Down', 'Unfortunately', 'bar', 'quite', 'low', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'really', 'enjoyable', 'performance', 'action', 'hero', 'role', 'choice', 'vehicle', 'was', 'questionable', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'internal', 'logic', 'film', 'FUBAR', ""'d"", 'word', 'Go', 'characters', 'behave', 'not', 'characters', 'what', 'most', 'convenient', 'plot', 'instead', 'providing', 'competent', 'villains', 'writers', 'gave', 'stupid', 'ones', 'Additionally', 'actions', 'terrorists', 'do', 'not', 'make', 'sense', 'biggest', 'offender', 'internal', 'logic', 'problem', 'however', 'president', 'regards', 'scenes', 'where', 'staff', 'tortured', 'watch', 'movie', 'will', 'instantly', 'catch', 'what', 'am', 'referring', 'hint', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'seeing', 'staff', 'get', 'put', 'ringer', 'what', 'do', 'think', 'terrorist', 'going', 'do', 'get', 'comply', 'plan', 'Genius', 'direction', 'overall', 'solid', 'main', 'detractors', 'here', 'are', 'story', 'choice', 'visuals', 'key', 'determinants', 'why', 'would', 'want', 'pay', 'see', 'movie.Should', 'buy', 'movie', 'Absolutely', 'not', 'one', 'thing', 'film', 'cheap', 'race', 'beat', 'White', 'House', 'Down', 'market', 'producers', 'cut', 'corners', 'obvious', 'scene', 'involving', 'CGI', 'fact', 'White', 'House', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'real', 'White', 'House', 'point', 'where', 'more', 'distraction', 'Story', 'mess', 'characters', 'show', 'up', 'random', 'places', 'when', 'logical', 'sense', 'be', 'scene', 'Banning', 'Girlfriend', 'final', 'scene', 'film', '.Should', 'rent', 'movie', 'Yea', ""'re"", 'kind', 'person', 'who', 'mindless', 'entertainment', 'not', 'saying', 'bad', 'way', 'did', 'watch', 'enjoy', 'film', 'what', 'was', 'then', 'definitely', 'worth', 'one', 'rental', 'enjoyable', 'see', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'return', 'genre', 'made', 'famous', 'merits', 'ownership', 'solid', 'action', 'movie', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously']",N/A

I heard about it coming out but didn't know what it was about in detail or if it was good or not. But with a promising cast including Gerard Butler and Morgan Freeman, I had to give it a shot. Olympus Has Fallen is a movie about a terrorist attack on the white house. A former secret service agent who works in D.C. happens to be around when the white house goes under attack. He springs into action, killing terrorist, saving lives, and tearing it up throughout the white house. The rest of the plot, I'll leave to the viewer to learn the final story and events without spoiling it.I rented it and watched it in one sitting. Bottom line - REALLY enjoyed this movie. Is it over the top? Yes. Is it completely ridiculous and unrealistic? Yes. Does any of that matter? Not really. This is a true, rock-em, sock-em, action flick with Gerard Butler's high energy driving it. I have to say the action really outweighed any downfalls/flops in the storyline. I really enjoyed it and usually I pick at movies like this. Honestly the only real thing besides the unrealistic side of the movie is the CGI. Some areas of the CGI were very budget-y and looked like clips out of a video game and not genuine elements. If you haven't seen this movie yet, I highly recommend it. A good date night movie or something to watch on your own one night. It's fun and entertaining and had me glued to the television from beginning to end. It's above average but I can't give it any more credit than that for a weak story and ridiculous action scenes.

1627863,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00BEIYHO2,FNDNreview,"[7, 15]","Without question, the action film is the most repetitive style of film in Hollywood.  Each one looks just like the last, only with different leads, a different setting, and the same old helpless hostage in need of rescue.  Still, the action film is considered to be one of, if not the most entertaining genre - because if it was good the first time, then it has to be good the next hundred times, right?  Well, since action films are all roughly the same, these movies are broke down into subcategories, starting with whom you'd enjoy as the lead.  When we think action stars, we instantly include Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, Bruce Willis, and possibly relative newcomer, Jason Statham.  Aside from that group of actors, Hollywood is essentially a revolving door of actors trying to play the part of the action star, using Matt Damon, Jeremy Renner, Liam Neeson, etc.  Who's in the revolving door this time?  It's no other than Mr. 300 himself, Gerard Butler - starring in Olympus Has Fallen.Directed by Antoine Fuqua (Training Day, Shooter), Olympus Has Fallen stars Gerard Butler as U.S. Secret Service agent, Mike Banning.  Assigned to protect U.S. President Benjamin Asher (Aaron Eckhart), Banning saves the president's life from a limousine accident on an icy bridge, but is unable to save the first lady (Ashley Judd).  Skipping ahead a months later, Banning has been removed from the president's detail as the president attempts to move on after the death of his wife.  At the same time, the South Korean Prime Minister and his delegation comes to Washington D.C. to meet with President Asher.  However, a member of the Korean delegation is secretly a North Korean terrorist, named Kang (Rick Yune).  Kang organizes an assault on the White House (code named Olympus), starting with an air assault, followed by a ground takeover of the White House premises, leading to the eventual capture of the president.  With the entire White House security detail neutralized, agent Banning is the only one left alive inside the White House to rescue the president and avert a nuclear war.  Morgan Freeman, Angela Bassett, and Dylan McDermott also star in supporting roles.First off, let it be known that Olympus Has Fallen is an action-packed extravaganza that will feed nearly all of your entertainment desires before all is said and done.  Aside from that, this film will offer you absolutely nothing.  But, he just said it was an extravaganza!?  Yes, there's plenty of senseless killing and explosions to easily pass the two hour run-time, yet the problem is you'll already know what's going to happen in the end after the first 20 minutes.  The film depicts the North Koreans as the villains, so was there ever a moment where you'd believe that the President of the United States would be assassinated by a North Korean?  It's bad enough the Koreans desecrates the Washington Monument in the film (and why films need to keep doing that is beyond comprehension), but they also annihilate more than half of the White House.  Aliens are allowed to destroy it (Independence Day), not the North Koreans.The acting in Olympus is hardly even worth mentioning, since it feels like there might only be about 3 minutes of combined dialogue throughout the film.  Gerard Butler portrays an adequate Secret Service agent with his mysterious eyes and amble butt-kicking ability, but it's not like he brought anything spectacular to this role.  In fact, if they used Steven Segal in the lead role, the film could have been called ""Under Siege 3,"" or if they used Harrison Ford as the president instead of Aaron Eckhardt (who gets a free pass in this film because he was in the much beloved Dark Knight), it could have been called ""Air Force One Part II"" (yeah, I know it wasn't on Air Force One this time, but hopefully you get the point).Overall, Olympus Has Fallen is exactly what it looks like from the trailers and the 15 second TV spots.  It's an action-packed film with a delusional premise, massive predictability disorder, and a plot line that resembles 99.9% of every other action film made over the course of human history.  If you're an action junkie and you have no problem watching the White House get blown to hell, this film is for you.One final thought - it makes you wonder what President Obama thinks about a film like this...Overall Film Grade:  C-FNDNreview.com",2,'Olympus Has Fallen' an entertaining knock-off,1364169600,"03 25, 2013",2013,4381,"['question', 'action', 'film', 'most', 'repetitive', 'style', 'film', 'Hollywood', 'one', 'just', 'last', 'only', 'different', 'leads', 'different', 'setting', 'same', 'old', 'helpless', 'hostage', 'need', 'rescue', 'Still', 'action', 'film', 'considered', 'be', 'one', 'not', 'most', 'entertaining', 'genre', 'was', 'good', 'first', 'time', 'then', 'be', 'good', 'next', 'hundred', 'times', 'right', 'Well', 'action', 'films', 'are', 'roughly', 'same', 'movies', 'are', 'broke', 'down', 'subcategories', 'starting', 'whom', ""'d"", 'enjoy', 'lead', 'When', 'think', 'action', 'stars', 'instantly', 'include', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'possibly', 'relative', 'newcomer', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'Aside', 'group', 'actors', 'Hollywood', 'essentially', 'revolving', 'door', 'actors', 'trying', 'play', 'part', 'action', 'star', 'using', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'etc', 'Who', 'revolving', 'door', 'time', 'other', 'Mr.', '300', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'starring', 'Olympus', 'Has', 'Fallen.Directed', 'Antoine', 'Fuqua', 'Training', 'Day', 'Shooter', 'Olympus', 'Has', 'Fallen', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'U.S.', 'Secret', 'Service', 'agent', 'Mike', 'Banning', 'Assigned', 'protect', 'U.S.', 'President', 'Benjamin', 'Asher', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'Banning', 'saves', 'president', 'life', 'limousine', 'accident', 'icy', 'bridge', 'unable', 'save', 'first', 'lady', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'Skipping', 'ahead', 'months', 'later', 'Banning', 'been', 'removed', 'president', 'detail', 'president', 'attempts', 'move', 'death', 'wife', 'same', 'time', 'South', 'Korean', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'delegation', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'meet', 'President', 'Asher', 'However', 'member', 'Korean', 'delegation', 'secretly', 'North', 'Korean', 'terrorist', 'named', 'Kang', 'Rick', 'Yune', 'Kang', 'assault', 'White', 'House', 'code', 'named', 'Olympus', 'starting', 'air', 'assault', 'followed', 'ground', 'takeover', 'White', 'House', 'leading', 'eventual', 'capture', 'president', 'entire', 'White', 'House', 'security', 'detail', 'neutralized', 'agent', 'Banning', 'only', 'one', 'left', 'alive', 'White', 'House', 'rescue', 'president', 'avert', 'nuclear', 'war', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Angela', 'Bassett', 'Dylan', 'McDermott', 'also', 'supporting', 'roles.First', 'off', 'let', 'be', 'known', 'Olympus', 'Has', 'Fallen', 'action-packed', 'extravaganza', 'will', 'feed', 'nearly', 'entertainment', 'desires', 'said', 'done', 'Aside', 'film', 'will', 'offer', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'just', 'said', 'was', 'extravaganza', 'Yes', 'plenty', 'senseless', 'killing', 'explosions', 'easily', 'pass', 'two', 'hour', 'run-time', 'problem', ""'ll"", 'already', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'end', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'film', 'North', 'Koreans', 'villains', 'so', 'was', 'ever', 'moment', 'where', ""'d"", 'believe', 'President', 'United', 'States', 'would', 'be', 'assassinated', 'North', 'Korean', 'bad', 'enough', 'Koreans', 'Washington', 'Monument', 'film', 'why', 'films', 'need', 'keep', 'doing', 'comprehension', 'also', 'annihilate', 'more', 'half', 'White', 'House', 'Aliens', 'are', 'allowed', 'destroy', 'Independence', 'Day', 'not', 'North', 'Koreans.The', 'acting', 'Olympus', 'hardly', 'even', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'might', 'only', 'be', '3', 'minutes', 'combined', 'dialogue', 'film', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'adequate', 'Secret', 'Service', 'agent', 'mysterious', 'eyes', 'amble', 'butt-kicking', 'ability', 'not', 'brought', 'anything', 'spectacular', 'role', 'fact', 'used', 'Steven', 'Segal', 'lead', 'role', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'called', 'Siege', '3', 'used', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'president', 'instead', 'Aaron', 'Eckhardt', 'who', 'free', 'pass', 'film', 'was', 'much', 'beloved', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'called', 'Air', 'Force', 'One', 'Part', 'II', 'yeah', 'know', 'was', ""n't"", 'Air', 'Force', 'One', 'time', 'hopefully', 'get', 'point', '.Overall', 'Olympus', 'Has', 'Fallen', 'exactly', 'what', 'trailers', '15', 'second', 'TV', 'spots', 'action-packed', 'film', 'delusional', 'premise', 'massive', 'predictability', 'disorder', 'plot', 'line', '99.9', '%', 'other', 'action', 'film', 'made', 'course', 'human', 'history', ""'re"", 'action', 'junkie', 'have', 'problem', 'watching', 'White', 'House', 'get', 'blown', 'hell', 'film', 'you.One', 'final', 'thought', 'wonder', 'what', 'President', 'Obama', 'film', 'Overall', 'Film', 'Grade', 'C-FNDNreview.com']",N/A

The supporting side stories do add to the flow of the story and can hold the audiences' attention.As far as impact is concerned, consider that our National People's House (AKA the White House), has been actually burned (by the British in the War of1812), crushed in &#34;Armageddon&#34;, blown up in &#34;Independence Day&#34;, and now partially in need of renovation here in &#34;Olympus Has Fallen&#34;; so if watching this type of poetic license via story line and CGI causes you angst go watch one of the &#34;007&#34; series movies.Unfortunately, the number of bloody shootings in this movie stretch the already frayed barrier of gun violence in movies (not to mention the helicopter crash into the East Wing and the Puff-the-Magic-Dragon gunship violence), so I would suggest that you be very selective in who watches the movie in your house. Little ones who may just now be learning moral values and rules could be very confused; unless of course playing &#34;Grand Theft Auto&#34; is the norm in your house.In many ways this movie stands alone among the Action Film genera based on its numerous story lines; you know, protecting little children, nasty North Korean rogues left over from one of those afore mentioned &#34;007&#34; movies, and the convoluted resuscitation plot line of a shamed Secret Service Agent (at least Gerard Butler is not portrayed in a party in a hotel in Columbia). A special note is called for here in that it is a known fact that Butler can portray the most believable &#34;down-in-the-mouth&#34; look of any actor currently working (Cary Grant and Jimmy Stewart were as better). There is, however, one huge grain of salt required to accept the part of the story that has Puff appearing over the Potomac river without having been dealt with earlier by the USAF or that there are numerous &#34;battle-worthy&#34; ground vehicles (including garbage trucks), that appear in front of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave without so much as an earlier &#34;by-or-leave&#34; from the half-dozen police and military agencies that have actual control of the couple of square miles around that address. So, there are a number of story holes (ahem, large enough to drive said trucks through), but once personal credulity has been dealt with then the story flows on.All in all a violent bit of fluff that can assist in popcorn sales and, pending the required suspensions mentioned above, one can smile when the bad guys (and girls), bite the dust.What is it that Clint Eastwood is famous for having said, oh yes, &#34;Make My Day&#34;!",4,A Remodeling of My Favorite White House,1378684800,"09 9, 2013",2013,2680,"['Well', 'conceived', 'story', 'believable', 'characterizations', 'throughout.Just', 'remember', 'action', 'film', 'not', '34', 'War', 'Peace', '34', 'supporting', 'side', 'stories', 'do', 'add', 'flow', 'story', 'can', 'hold', 'audiences', 'attention.As', 'far', 'impact', 'concerned', 'consider', 'National', 'People', 'House', 'AKA', 'White', 'House', 'been', 'actually', 'burned', 'British', 'War', 'of1812', 'crushed', '34', 'Armageddon', '34', 'blown', 'up', '34', 'Independence', 'Day', '34', 'now', 'partially', 'need', 'renovation', 'here', '34', 'Olympus', 'Has', 'Fallen', '34', 'so', 'watching', 'type', 'poetic', 'license', 'story', 'line', 'CGI', 'angst', 'go', 'watch', 'one', '34', '007', '34', 'series', 'movies.Unfortunately', 'number', 'bloody', 'shootings', 'movie', 'stretch', 'already', 'frayed', 'barrier', 'gun', 'violence', 'movies', 'not', 'mention', 'helicopter', 'crash', 'East', 'Wing', 'Puff-the-Magic-Dragon', 'gunship', 'violence', 'would', 'suggest', 'be', 'very', 'selective', 'who', 'watches', 'movie', 'house', 'Little', 'ones', 'who', 'may', 'just', 'now', 'be', 'learning', 'moral', 'values', 'rules', 'could', 'be', 'very', 'confused', 'course', 'playing', '34', 'Grand', 'Theft', 'Auto', '34', 'norm', 'house.In', 'many', 'ways', 'movie', 'alone', 'Action', 'Film', 'genera', 'based', 'numerous', 'story', 'lines', 'know', 'protecting', 'little', 'children', 'nasty', 'North', 'Korean', 'rogues', 'left', 'over', 'one', 'afore', 'mentioned', '34', '007', '34', 'movies', 'convoluted', 'resuscitation', 'plot', 'line', 'shamed', 'Secret', 'Service', 'Agent', 'least', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'not', 'portrayed', 'party', 'hotel', 'Columbia', 'special', 'note', 'called', 'here', 'known', 'fact', 'Butler', 'can', 'portray', 'most', 'believable', '34', 'down-in-the-mouth', '34', 'look', 'actor', 'currently', 'working', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'were', 'better', 'however', 'one', 'huge', 'grain', 'salt', 'required', 'accept', 'part', 'story', 'Puff', 'appearing', 'Potomac', 'river', 'having', 'been', 'dealt', 'earlier', 'USAF', 'are', 'numerous', '34', 'battle-worthy', '34', 'ground', 'vehicles', 'including', 'garbage', 'trucks', 'appear', 'front', '1600', 'Pennsylvania', 'Ave', 'so', 'much', 'earlier', '34', 'by-or-leave', '34', 'half-dozen', 'police', 'military', 'agencies', 'have', 'actual', 'control', 'couple', 'square', 'miles', 'address', 'So', 'are', 'number', 'story', 'holes', 'ahem', 'large', 'enough', 'drive', 'said', 'trucks', 'once', 'personal', 'credulity', 'been', 'dealt', 'then', 'story', 'on.All', 'violent', 'bit', 'fluff', 'can', 'assist', 'popcorn', 'sales', 'pending', 'required', 'suspensions', 'mentioned', 'one', 'can', 'smile', 'when', 'bad', 'guys', 'girls', 'dust.What', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'famous', 'having', 'said', 'oh', 'yes', '34', 'Make', 'My', 'Day', '34']",N/A

And if non-stop 2 hours of killing is your cup of poison then this film has that and more. The frightening aspect of viewing this film is the current focus on security leaks, the failure of misplaced intervention in other country's wars, the concern about China's and North Korea's and Russia's response to US actions over the Snowden matter, and the continued random appearing terror attacks throughout the world and terrorist-like attacks here at home that add a degree of credibility to what in previous years would seem like an absurd story. It is food for thought - or for tweeting...When the White House (aka ""Olympus"" according to Secret Service Code) is captured by a Korean terrorist mastermind (Rick Yune) with his cast of thousand assistants and the President (Aaron Eckhart) is kidnapped, disgraced former Presidential guard Mike Banning (Gerard Butler), who still reels with the guilt of not having saved the President's wife (Ashley Judd) in a tragic car accident, finds himself trapped within the building. As our national security team scrambles to respond, they are forced to rely on Banning's inside knowledge to help retake the White House, save the President and avert an even bigger disaster. The White House staff who escape into hiding to observe the derring-do include Morgan Freeman as the Speaker of the House cum interim President, Secret Service Director Angela Basset, General Clegg as portrayed by Robert Forster, and traitor par excellence Forbes (Dylan McDermott) and the others in the cast include Radha Mitchell as Banning's wife and Finley Jacobsen as his young son Connor and Melissa Leo as the tortured Secretary of Defense Ruth McMillan.Where the story (written by Creighton Rothenberger and Katrin Benedkt) falls apart is the failure of security and military measures designed to protect the Whit House during such situations. Hopefully in reality it is not that crude and mismanaged!  Not a bad action film (it keeps you watching closely for 2 hours) but a bit to phony in its patriotic ending.

Disgraced former Presidential guard, Mike Banning, finds himself trapped inside the White House in the middle of a terrorist attack on the White House.  Manning uses his knowledge of the White House to elude the terrorist and to+++++++++++++++SPOILER ALERT+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++save the President's son.  This movie is similar in one respect toRedlinersyou don't want to miss a second; it is one action scene after another.  You might want to visit the little boy's room before the movie starts or girl's room if you are of that persuasion.  Morgan Freeman was cast perfectly, in my opinion, as the Speaker of the House/ acting President.  Ashley Judd just has a cameo role, sadly. (I like her).  I have read where this was the low budget version of the two White House movies coming out this year.  Well, the pyrotechnic budget certainly wasn't low.  Maybe they saved money on the actors.I recommend this movie for fans of vintage David Drake novels, Bruce Willis movies, and others who just want an adrenaline ride!I, also, enjoyed my lunch while watching the movie.  The food prices are comparable to a Chilli's or O'Charley's.The movie was $6.00.If you haven't tried this fork and spoon concept pick a movie that you want to see and just do it!Gunner  2013Guess who the terrorist were?

Don't read if you're going to watch, just skip this review.I was actually looking forward to this movie, despite some weak reviews; I thought perhaps it just hadn't stacked up against the other, terrorists-attack-the-White-House movie in 2012/3.  But within minutes of starting it, I literally started to laugh, and told my S.O. that &#34;OMG, it's 'Under Siege!'  It's 'Under Siege' exactly,&#34;, and so it was.  I actually got to the point of pausing the movie, and saying, &#34;next will be that scene where Steven Segal (sp?) tells the guy at the Pentagon/Ops Center where to put it,&#34; or &#34;next they'll deploy the Seals against the guy's advice, and they'll all die,&#34; and sure enough, I was correct, all the way through.Literally, at some point in 2011, somebody involved in this film was up late at night, watched &#34;Under Siege&#34; and thought...&#34;y'know, I could make that movie, set at the White House.&#34;  Because it's almost a direct copy, line-for-line, plot element by plot element.  From the inner traitor (Gary Busey in US), to the heads (of this/that/next thing) gathered around the conference table with the speaker phone (Situation Room), to the gloating terrorist (Tommy Lee Jones in the original), to the disparaging, &#34;he's only attached to treasury now, he USED TO BE a SS agent&#34; (Busey talking about Seagal in the original)...I mean, it's practically a verbatim lift from the Seagal movie, which, even though I can't abide that actor, at least was *somewhat* original the first time around. The fact that I was able to know EXACTLY what was coming, scene-by-scene (they even had the hero knocked off the top of the WH by a helicopter/Seagal gets knocked off the Carrier by a helicopter; the dialogue between the hero and the Situation Room--you'll have to courts-martial me/fire me later bit) was almost funny, it was so blatant.  I'm shocked to see people calling it a Die Hard ripoff, (although arguably, you could say that US was a Die Hard ripoff), because let's face it, at least Die Hard was good, and it had some funny moments.  No funny moments here, BTW.  What this has that U.S. did not have is a scene showing how the hero ended up being &#34;disgraced&#34; (Segal/Seal/now Chef didn't have that; it was revealed in later dialogue).So:  if you've seen Under Siege, you've seen this movie. I mean, you've REALLY seen this movie.  I gave it two stars for the budget, but I would have rated it one star for the egregiously blatant line-by-line, er, &#34;homage&#34; to Under Siege.  I know that Hollywood is out of ideas--hell, they're remaking Terminator, for the love of heaven---but unless somebody paid somebody else to use the original Under Siege script (like &#34;Barb Wire&#34; for &#34;Casablanca&#34;), then the producers here owe the Under Siege scriptwriters some dough.  Not kidding.  I couldn't even just try to relax and enjoy the film, because all I could see were the endless similarities.(BTW:  if I had taken a beating, in order not to give out my uber-secret code for our last line of defense, I'd be pretty pissed off that the Prez waited until I was a bloody pulp to THEN say, &#34;oh, give it to them, that's an order.&#34;  What a load of old bollocks.  If I'd been the Sec.Def or Sec.State, whatever it was she was playing, I'd have kicked the Prez in the gonads when I got back to my tied-up position.  Just, for what it's worth.  Seemed like a ridiculous plot element.  Give it, or don't; take the beating, or don't--why take the beating and THEN submissively tell the Prez, &#34;oh, okay,&#34; and spit it out?

Olympus Has Fallen is bad almost from the first frame, delivering Michael Bay-quality set ups with a score so over the top with military beats and heroic drums that it makes Independence Day look like Top Gun on the Fourth of July. I enjoyed counting the foreshadowing moments through the entire first act almost as much as the drinking game I'd invented where you have to take a shot every time somebody talks in exposition (you'd actually need a serious liver to take on this challenge).Plot-wise, there really isn't one beyond the North Koreans invading the White House. They take out the entire US Air Force of two jets with machine guns while every police officer and Secret Service agent forgets their training and runs out into a hail of bullets to get killed as fast as possible. Gerard Butler meanwhile performs a recreation of Clint Eastward from In The Line of Fire without the wit and jazz while Dylan McDermott actually plays the same character from the same film, but this time he's a traitor.It's really hard to care much about what happens partly because of the non-existent characterization but also because the CGI is some of the worst in living memory and distracted me every time it appeared. Seeing as you can get pictures of the White House online, it's amazing that none of the shots in the film look anything like the main building itself, and there are video games with better CG shots than this. It's also somewhat tragic watching some great actors literally paying their rent and snoozing their performances throughout the flick.If you're looking for some brainless entertainment for a weekend evening, this unfortunately isn't it.

Among the others there is secret service agent Mike Banning (Butler).  While the group is en route, a terrible accident occurs which claims the life of the first lady (Ashley Judd).  Mike manages to save the President, however.  Despite his split-second decision to save the President, Banning is released from his duties.Fast forward 18 months.  Mike is now working in the Treasury department.  A mysterious C-130 gunship is spotted flying over Washington D.C.  Soon, it starts shooting up everyone and everything in sight.  Fighters are scrambled and the White House's missile system is activated, but to no avail.  Eventually the plane is brought down but not before dozens of North Korean terrorists have stormed the White House, kidnapped the President and vital members of his cabinet, and locked themselves in the Presidential bunker 120 feet below the surface.Witnessing these activities from the Treasury department, Mike makes his way over to the White House.  Finding most of the secret service agents on duty dead, Mike make his way inside, determined to do whatever he can to stop the terrorists.  In the meantime, the Speaker of the House (Freeman) has taken control of the government.  Now begins a cat-and-mouse game between the Speaker, Banning, and the terrorist leader (Rick Yune).  Who will win?This is an excellent movie.  The plot is exciting and the acting, especially by Butler and Freeman is first-rate.

1627980,AVWU1O6TH3SXG,B00BEIYHO2,"J. McGinn ""HUNTSMAN""","[2, 4]","Beware the dreaded North Korean's are coming. I see Hollywood who Hollywood has chosen for its bad guy in the early part of the decade, that being North Korea. Hollywood always does this and from the late 1990's to most of the 2000's it was Muslims and terrorists. In the early 1980 to mid-1980's it was communists along with the growing war on drugs that took over in the late 1980's to the mid-1990's. Yes every half decade to decade Hollywood finds the hot issue of the day in the United States and makes films about them and rightly so. Many times it works, but for the films to be good they have to make the films somewhat believable and that is what Hollywood faces with North Korea. Yes North Korea is a totalitarian nation that treats its people horribly, has one of the largest armies in the world and has nuclear weapons but Hollywood seems to want to overestimate its capabilities. Like in the terrible remake of Red Dawn they actually had North Korea invading the United States that's beyond ridiculous. Heck even in the 1980's when the USSR was still around it couldn't have invaded the US. By the early to mid-1970's the USSR was declining fast. They didn't have the man power, resources or money for that type of invasion. Still that was far more plausible than North Korea invading the US even with the even more ridiculous reason Red Dawn gave us. As of right now there is no nation that could single handily invade the United States. Heck Mexico with all its drug cartels has a better chance of invading the United States than I think any other nation in the world.In Olympus Has Fallen the plot of how the North Korean's get into and manage to take the White House is ridiculous, but is far more plausible than what happened in Red Dawn. As we all saw with 9/11 and other terrorist attacks it is possible to get around defenses with a small number of men and wreak havoc. In that the plot is somewhat believable and plausible, but it's still unbelievable about how they go about it. Once you get past the ridiculousness of the concept Olympus has fallen is an enjoyable action film. The film follows Secret Service agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) as he goes from being President Benjamin Asher's (Aaron Eckhart) head agent guarding him to a desk job after an accident that kills the president's wife played by Ashley Judd, who if blink won't even realize is in the film. The president no longer wants to see Mike and has bigger problems of his own as just like today is causing trouble and the president is set to meet the Prime Minister of South Korea when all hell breaks loose. The President along with the Prime Minister is rushed into the bunker while Mike fights his way into the White House to rescue the president and his son.While the plot is definitely the major problem with the film the action was well done from the beginning when the North Korean's invade the White House the action is intense. Also make no mistake the film is rated R, and it is a hard R rating with women being beaten, men being tortured and killed, killing of civilian, lots of blood and much more. The riveting action harkens back the action films of the 1980's and films like Die Hard and Rambo.Olympus has fallen is without question Gerard Butler's film. The actor hasn't had a great career since his break out role in 300 with the like of Gamer and Playing for Keeps, but he's shines here with his limited back story and dialog. You believe he is an ex-Ranger and Secret Service Agent, and like 300 and even with the bad Gamer film he's shown he knows how to do action. Unfortunately besides Butler the supporting cast is limited. There are of course bright spots with Cole Hauser whose shown he is a solid supporting character along with Rick Yune who is excellent as Kang Yeonsak the main baddy of the film. He brings much need drama and terror to the film. Kang blows away that incompetent Captain from Red Dawn out of the water. Those are the three real bright spots. As I said Ashley Judd is like ghost if you blind you'll miss her. Aaron Eckhart just wasn't that great of film president. He did a decent job, but I want my movie presidents to be like Harrison Ford in Air Force One. Morgan Freeman just seemed like he was sleep walking through the film.I've enjoyed director Antoine Fuqua's films since I first saw the much underrated Replacement Killers. He's proven he knows how to do intense action and drama and continues that here. Is this his best film plot and character wise? The answer is a definite no, but Olympus Has Fallen is one of his best action films bring together the outrageous with the intense putting together one of the better action films of the year.Olympus Has Fallen has continued 2013 trend of lackluster to bad films and is certainly no means a great, or really good film. What Olympus Has Fallen is a really good action film with an unbelievable script, decent acting and good directing? Can Roland Emmerich's White House Down top the grandiose scale and ridiculousness of Olympus Has Fallen? There is no question the answer is yes, but will it be a better film I doubt it. In all honest if you are looking for anything more than an entertaining good time with some good action I'd skip Olympus Has Fallen and White House Down.",3,How can Roland Emmerich and White House

1628000,ABQUJ3Z6EP5GN,B00BEIYHO2,John's Horror Corner,"[8, 10]","Behold the unbelievable scenario of Gerard Butler versus like 60 North Korean black ops terrorists and Butler wins.  A satisfying movie for guys who like movies with explosions, throat punches, machine guns and knife fights.  It's like one super-long action sequence.Agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler; Machine Gun Preacher, Gamer) was transferred from the Secret Service after an accident resulted in the death of President Asher's (Aaron Eckhart) wife.  He's bored of his new desk job and misses being by his friend the president's side.  But the president cannot bear the memory of his wife's death.During a meeting in the White House, the South Korean Prime Minister's chief of security Kang  goes rogue.  He is actually a long dark-ops North Korean terrorist with sinister plans for the United States. Rick Yune (The Man with the Iron Fists, Ninja Assassin) really owns the role of Kang and his ""no foolin' around"" hard line of terrorism.Kang's White House takeover gives audiences a lot of continuous, intense action.  There are suicide bombers, huge guns, rapid fire guns, a kamikaze air assault, missile strikes, missile decoys, smoke bombs, explosions, creative road blocks, terrorists in tourists' clothing and insider double-crosses--it drew a lot of laughs, smiles and ""ooohs"" from the action movie fans in the audience.  The White House lawn was painted red as somehow Banning snuck his way into the White House before Kang's men had complete control.Making his entrance, Banning watched in horror as secret service agents, responding to the sound of loads of gunfire, recklessly ran out into the open through the front door and were mowed down by Gatling guns.  For the sake of an impressive body count, the writers seemed to have decided that secret service men an White House security details are rather poorly trained and have no concept of using cover or evasive maneuvers when under fire.  This was a blaring flaw and it came with a lot of ""OMG, REALLY!?!""  But it also made it fun.With the president and vice president held hostage, House Speaker Turnbull (Morgan Freeman) assumes the pressures of acting president.  As Turnbull weighs Kang's threats with global security, Banning starts wading his way through the White House halls and BRUTALLY picking off Kang's elite trained operatives.  The hand-to-hand combat isn't quite what I'd prefer, filmed very close up, sometimes shaky, and with choppy one-cut-per-move editing.  But hey, this isn't a martial arts movie.  It's a series of super-long action sequences kind of movie.  And the hard hitting action sequences are quite pleasing to this action junkie!Supporting actors include Angela Bassett as Banning's boss, Melissa Leo as the Defense Secretary and Radha Mitchell as Banning's wife.  Everyone did a fine job.  My biggest complaint wouldn't be with the acting, but the writing in the early scenes when we have the president's healthy happy family routine shoved down our throats.  Too many rainbows and not enough ""real.""  But, again, this movie is largely a continuous IV drip of action.  So I'll let it slide.Director Antoine Fuqua (Shooter, King Arthur, Training Day) must have anticipated how bad A Good Day to Die Hard was going to be and decided to give us ""Die Hard in the White House"" starring Gerard Butler to make up for it.  In fact, this movie was stunningly similar to the awesomely epic Die Hard and Live Free or Die Hard.  Let me count the ways...  1) The calm, cool, collected Kang looked so sleek in his vest outfit, not unlike the dashing and dapper, cardiganed Timothy Olyphant.  2) Like the Maggie Q to Olyphant, Kang also had a tough Asian computer whiz at his side who could hold her own in a fight.  3)  Like Willis' John MacClane, Butler takes a beating in this movie and his bruises and blood don't magically disappear between scenes as he takes heavy doses of punishment.  4) Like MacClane in Die Hard, Banning is the only line of communication with the outside, it takes a while for Kang to realize he's even there, Kang and Banning exchange some smack talk and threats, a bad guy pretends to be a good guy to try to kill Banning, and when the acting president and his panel don't listen to Banning bad stuff happens.  5) Banning and his wife are also having some problems--classic MacClane!  Basically, this movie was Die Hard with a North Korean Timothy Olyphant and Maggie Q in the White House.Is this a bad thing?  Hell, no!  I enjoyed it.  It was a fun.  Although it was loaded with faults, the faults sort of contributed to the fun.",4,Behold the unbelievable scenario of Gerard Butler versus like 60 North Korean black ops terrorists and Butler

1628004,AB1GI9IJN22X0,B00BEIYHO2,Jonathan K,"[0, 2]","What to say. You couldn't ask for a better action movie with a great cast. Sure the whole plot was a bit absurd, I have more faith in our military and the response teams to protect the president and the white house than was shown in the opening siege. I know for a fact that a bogey c130 would never had made it into dc causing the damage it did before being taking down, regardless if it had USAF markings on it. They would not have asked the plane to turn around, it would have been shot down immediately. .... You can't make this movie out to be some political statement or look for deep thought about the characters or society. It was non stop action thriller in a hypothetical situation, one that would never happen but fun to watch. Now bein said, the acting president would never had ordered the 7th fleet to withdrawal to save the lives of the president and his cabinet, nor would he have withdrawn the troops from the dmz. If such a Cerberus device exist those people would have died before giving up a secret code. True they are only human and humans are fallible, but I like to think that as a proud American each one would have died before givin up the first two codes, and the president would have let them die to save the country and the world. So yeah this movie takes some giant leaps into the insane and absurd, but not everyone in our government is a snowden traitor; and its still enjoyable. What I did believe is the strength and character Butler's character portrayed, our boys are trained well and can kick ass all over the world. The fight scenes were epic. Yes it was bloody but it couldn't be any other way in this scenario. Will I watch this movie again, hoora, yes I will with the surround sound up louder.  Would loved to have seen in the credits America's response with full scale invasion of North Korea, or more so nuclear devastation of its insane ass leaders.

1628005,A369KP0JV77JYT,B00BEIYHO2,Jon,"[0, 0]","Not a long review, and little specifics since I don't want to ruin the surprise, since half the fun of an action movie like this is the suspense of what will happen.  I love Olympus Has Fallen (hereafter ""OHF"")!  It was a lot of fun, well-thought out, simple, not full of overacting or one-liners, and seemingly-accurate enough you actually hope it is not that accurate!  It was like watching a Tom Clancy novel acted out, with how the White House gets taken over, first by a major attack then by a simultaneous series of smaller but equally effective attacks.  The initial attack reminded me of the end of Clancy's Debt of Honor on the scale of how it happens.  And once that initial attack occurs, it reminded me of 24 where the terrorists take over the White House with actual soldiers.So, from above, you can glean that this movie, as others have pointed out, is not particularly ""original,"" and yet it at the same time has not been done specifically like this before.  And few movies are ""original"" these days anyway, and this one doesn't pretend to be.  Regardless, it is thrilling and makes your blood boil as an American when the initial attack occurs.  OHF was like from the days when Hollywood pumped out action movies, whereas these days any one of those would be a rare big-budget A-lister movie.  It was like a Steven Seagal or Die Hard flick, only on a grander scale since it is the WHITE HOUSE.Since OHF came out around the same time as White House Down, I will say I was not nearly as much a fan of that movie.  This movie the actors are much more muted in their performances, WHD the actors you just think of as being actors.Bottom-line: fun, straightforward, well-worth a rent, and buying depending on the price.  After having rented before, I bought it new through a 3rd party seller on here for under $10 total (after shipping), since while I really like it I don't think it is worth paying anything over $14 to keep, I would say.",4,"Fantastic throwback to the good old straightforward shoot-em-ups, with some intelligence",1399680000,"05 10, 2014",2014,1950,"['Not', 'long', 'review', 'little', 'specifics', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'ruin', 'surprise', 'fun', 'action', 'movie', 'suspense', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'love', 'Olympus', 'Has', 'Fallen', 'hereafter', 'OHF', 'was', 'lot', 'fun', 'well-thought', 'out', 'simple', 'not', 'full', 'overacting', 'one-liners', 'seemingly-accurate', 'enough', 'actually', 'hope', 'not', 'accurate', 'was', 'watching', 'Tom', 'Clancy', 'novel', 'acted', 'out', 'how', 'White', 'House', 'taken', 'over', 'first', 'major', 'attack', 'then', 'simultaneous', 'series', 'smaller', 'equally', 'effective', 'attacks', 'initial', 'attack', 'reminded', 'end', 'Clancy', 'Debt', 'Honor', 'scale', 'how', 'once', 'initial', 'attack', 'reminded', '24', 'where', 'terrorists', 'take', 'White', 'House', 'actual', 'soldiers.So', 'can', 'glean', 'movie', 'others', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'not', 'particularly', 'original', 'yet', 'same', 'time', 'not', 'been', 'done', 'specifically', 'before', 'few', 'movies', 'are', 'original', 'days', 'anyway', 'one', ""n't"", 'pretend', 'be', 'Regardless', 'thrilling', 'blood', 'boil', 'American', 'when', 'initial', 'attack', 'occurs', 'OHF', 'was', 'days', 'when', 'Hollywood', 'pumped', 'out', 'action', 'movies', 'days', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'rare', 'big-budget', 'A-lister', 'movie', 'was', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'Die', 'Hard', 'flick', 'only', 'grander', 'scale', 'WHITE', 'HOUSE.Since', 'OHF', 'came', 'out', 'same', 'time', 'White', 'House', 'Down', 'will', 'say', 'was', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'fan', 'movie', 'movie', 'actors', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'muted', 'performances', 'WHD', 'actors', 'just', 'think', 'being', 'actors.Bottom-line', 'fun', 'straightforward', 'well-worth', 'rent', 'buying', 'depending', 'price', 'having', 'rented', 'bought', 'new', '3rd', 'party', 'seller', 'here', '10', 'total', 'shipping', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'worth', 'paying', 'anything', '14', 'keep', 'would', 'say']",N/A

Enter the movie entitled: Olympus Has FallenOlympus Has Fallen has a very strong cast that consists of Aaron Eckhart as President Asher, Gerard Butler as Mike Banning, the beautiful Angela Basset as Lynne Jacobs, Morgan Freeman as Speaker Alan Trumbull, and Rick Yune as the main antagonist, Kang Yeonsak.To describe the story: It starts off with President Asher and Mike Banning who are having a bit of friendly sparring match; thus it is pretty obvious early on that the President and Mike has close ties with each other. However, while on the road one night the unthinkable happens, and things take an unexpected turn.Now fast forward a year and 6 months later, Mike no longer has the close ties he once had with the President, but he still works at the treasury department. I will stop there because I do not want to write the movie detail by detail. I will say that while the President is in a meeting with North Koreans, a hostage crisis occurs directly within the White House. Thus, we are given a high octane, thrill made for eyes type of movie.I admired everything about Olympus Has Fallen. Aaron Eckhart's previous film Battle LA was not the best, but he makes up for it in this one. The story is addictive, the acting is top notch, and for a movie of its genre, Olympus Has Fallen Shines.In short, Olympus Has Fallen is Daringly bold and gloriously victorious.

I actually felt like I was watching something on the news, as it was happening.  I have never felt like that when watching a movie.  It was exciting, frightening and interesting.  It moved at a speed that was easy to follow and really drew you in.  I will buy this when it comes out.  Seems like a cool movie to watch at night while feeling safe at home.The movie is about a president who is taken hostage.  The hostages want to get something from him and others there it order to gain access to something that could destroy parts of the world.  The terrorist are VERY well trained and have high grade military weapons.  They are very well set up and have planned and set up what they are doing.  They end up taking over the White House!  Once inside they give their list of demands.  Will they get what they desire, or will they be stopped in time to save millions?  You will have to watch to find out.That is really it.  I did not want to give to much away.  Now, if I liked it so much and am going to buy it, why the 3 out of 5?  I will tell you why.  The movie was SO far fetched that it made it kind of hard to REALLY get into.  I was sitting there and thought to myself, this could never happen.  But, the interesting thing is I only go that feeling once.  The rest of the time I felt like I was watching something that was or had actually happened.  You have to let your mind loose it's reality.  It makes it really fun.Here is what I think was wrong with the movie.  Firstly, the tragic thing that happens in the beginning of the movie.  I do not really see the point.  I guess I understand that they had to set up another character.  But it seems they could have done it a different way.  The thing that happened was just done and that was it.  Second, it just so happens that ALL the people the terrorist needed to complete their mission were in the white house.  Kind of a lucky break, no?  Third, the president was sitting there telling the others needed to give the terrorist what they wanted because he would never give it to them.  He did not want them to be killed by the terrorist.  Does that make sense?  First, unless the president was an idiotic child, he would easily understand that while a few may die, millions would be saved.  What kind of idiot would say just give them the information?  If they were killed, the terrorist would need more time to complete their mission.  Thus buying the Government more time.  Then, after the people gave the information, why would the man in charge, who was one of the most wanted terrorist in the world not kill them?  He didn't care about honor or respect.  Why would he let them live?  The president would have to know this.  Yet he said ""just give them the things they want.""  Didn't really make sense.  Next, how could these people get into all of these military computers?  I understand there are hackers and they can do a lot.  But the Government never realized their data was being broken into?  Then, after it was, they did nothing to stop it?  Come on, crazy.  Next, they send teams in first to try and stop the terrorist.  Would they really just have them run up to the white house or land their chopper right on the front lawn?  Seems they would have to strategize.  Another thing is this, these people had all these things they were doing with computers and tech, could the government not just send out an EMP?  Does that not disable all the electronic items?  Seems that would have stopped them right there.  This has went on for a while, so I will end it two more things.  This guy is one of the most wanted terrorist in the world.  Yet, he just walked around in D.C. and is able to get into the White House?  Nobody realized who he was?  Do they not have computers for those kinds of things?  FINALLY, the terrorist are flying a large plane in D.C., it is right over the white house.  Come on, it would be stopped before he got close to the place.  That is what I was saying earlier, these people have such high tech, top quality items.  Yet the Government had no idea they existed.  As my mom and I were leaving, I told her I actually felt like I was watching an anime.So there it is, the movie was cool.  I was sitting there and was totally into it.

1628016,ADCC3WHSZNW1R,B00BEIYHO2,J. Richardson,"[1, 1]","Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.The role of lonely action-hero is one that is constantly up for grabs. Sure, you have your Die Hards and your Bournes, but that doesn't stop Hollywood from churning out a few other strays in between sequels to those series. It should be noted, though, that Olympus Has Fallen isn't a full-on ripoff, but it's very easy to draw similarities between this film and the two previously mentioned franchises. Die Hard, in particular, due to the fact that you have your macho lead (Gerard Butler) who makes it his responsibility to save the day when things take a turn for the worse.Mike Banning (Butler) is an ex-U.S. Army Ranger and former Secret Service agent. After a terrible crash that led to the death of the first lady (Ashley Judd), Banning transfers to the Treasury Department. At this time, President Benjamin Asher (Aaron Eckhart) is having a political meeting with South Korean Prime Minister Lee Tae-Woo (Keong Sim). Disguised as a South Korean ministerial aide, Kang Yeonsak (Rick Yune) has set-up a plan of attack on the White House. Driven by the repercussions of past wars, Kang wishes to leave America just as broken and desolate as Korea. Using his skill-set, Banning makes his way into the White House in hopes of saving the president, his son, and the country.In my opinion, there were two things that really stood out while watching this movie; the action sequences and the film's ability to keep you on your toes. The film, surprisingly, clocks out at around two hours, but there is rarely a dull moment. Even in the beginning of the film, which is usually set-up to gain an understanding of the characters, the writers hit you with a big set piece around ten minutes in. From that point on the film becomes an adrenaline rush as you go from firefight to firefight, fistfight to knife fight, rinse and repeat. It's the nonstop action that kept me engaged throughout majority of the story.With that said, though, there are also two big negatives that stood out to me as well; the film's generic nature and the extremely dated visual effects. Because this is an action flick it's hard to feel worried about the well-being of Banning, the president, or the country. We know he's going to come out on top and we know the country isn't going to end up in ruins. Part of me wishes that, just once, we get a movie that goes against the grain. One where the antagonist comes out on top, showing that not every hero prevails in the end. I know it's a stretch, but it is something I would like to see at some point.Then there were the visual effects. I had a similar complaint with the latest Die Hard film, but Olympus Has Fallen definitely has it worse. Because there's a lot of action done outside, as well as inside, there's bound to be a lot of special effects throughout majority of the movie. They're obviously not going to shoot down a bunch of helicopters just to make it authentic and they're also not going to run a plane through the Washington Monument. I understand that, but if the budget isn't large enough to make it look good then it isn't something that should be kept in the film. Most of the big set pieces looked like CGI that was ripped from a ten year old movie.Performance wise you get what you can expect from an action-flick. There's not a terrible amount of emotion in any of the characters' dialogue so don't expect to be blown away by any of the performances. With that said, though, both Butler and Yune played their roles well. Butler is (almost) always enjoyable in films like these and Yune was able to be both intimidating and terribly menacing at the same time. Eckhart was ok, but it definitely wasn't the performance of his career. For the most part, he didn't have much dialogue and his character was annoyingly spineless. And while it was nice to see Morgan Freeman as the Speaker of the House Allan Trumbull, he didn't get enough screen-time to make much of an impact.Overall Score: 7/10 - Olympus Has Fallen succeeds in being a mindless action flick, but it fails to be anything more than that. The story isn't overly interesting and it can become predictable at times. Then there's the dated visual effects and emotionless acting which don't do much to add to the overall enjoyment of the film. Still, it's enjoyable for what it is. The action sequences are unique and it's a fun adrenaline rush. If you have some time to kill then I would recommend giving it a shot, but it isn't something you should go out of your way to see.",4,7/10 - It's ok,1378857600,"09 11, 2013",2013,4526,"['Note', 'May', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'Proceed', 'caution.The', 'role', 'lonely', 'action-hero', 'one', 'constantly', 'up', 'grabs', 'Sure', 'have', 'Die', 'Hards', 'Bournes', ""n't"", 'stop', 'Hollywood', 'churning', 'out', 'few', 'other', 'strays', 'sequels', 'series', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'though', 'Olympus', 'Has', 'Fallen', ""n't"", 'full-on', 'ripoff', 'very', 'easy', 'draw', 'similarities', 'film', 'two', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'franchises', 'Die', 'Hard', 'particular', 'due', 'fact', 'have', 'macho', 'lead', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'who', 'responsibility', 'save', 'day', 'when', 'things', 'take', 'turn', 'worse.Mike', 'Banning', 'Butler', 'ex-U.S.', 'Army', 'Ranger', 'former', 'Secret', 'Service', 'agent', 'terrible', 'crash', 'led', 'death', 'first', 'lady', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'Banning', 'transfers', 'Treasury', 'Department', 'time', 'President', 'Benjamin', 'Asher', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'having', 'political', 'meeting', 'South', 'Korean', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Lee', 'Tae-Woo', 'Keong', 'Sim', 'Disguised', 'South', 'Korean', 'ministerial', 'aide', 'Kang', 'Yeonsak', 'Rick', 'Yune', 'set-up', 'plan', 'attack', 'White', 'House', 'Driven', 'repercussions', 'past', 'wars', 'Kang', 'leave', 'America', 'just', 'broken', 'desolate', 'Korea', 'Using', 'skill-set', 'Banning', 'way', 'White', 'House', 'hopes', 'saving', 'president', 'son', 'country.In', 'opinion', 'were', 'two', 'things', 'really', 'stood', 'out', 'watching', 'movie', 'action', 'sequences', 'film', 'ability', 'keep', 'toes', 'film', 'surprisingly', 'out', 'around', 'two', 'hours', 'rarely', 'dull', 'moment', 'Even', 'beginning', 'film', 'usually', 'set-up', 'gain', 'understanding', 'characters', 'writers', 'hit', 'big', 'set', 'piece', 'ten', 'minutes', 'point', 'film', 'adrenaline', 'rush', 'go', 'firefight', 'firefight', 'fistfight', 'knife', 'fight', 'rinse', 'repeat', 'nonstop', 'action', 'kept', 'engaged', 'majority', 'story.With', 'said', 'though', 'are', 'also', 'two', 'big', 'negatives', 'stood', 'out', 'well', 'film', 'generic', 'nature', 'extremely', 'dated', 'visual', 'effects', 'action', 'flick', 'hard', 'feel', 'worried', 'well-being', 'Banning', 'president', 'country', 'know', 'going', 'come', 'out', 'top', 'know', 'country', ""n't"", 'going', 'end', 'up', 'ruins', 'Part', 'just', 'once', 'get', 'movie', 'grain', 'One', 'where', 'antagonist', 'out', 'top', 'showing', 'not', 'hero', 'end', 'know', 'stretch', 'something', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'point.Then', 'were', 'visual', 'effects', 'had', 'similar', 'complaint', 'latest', 'Die', 'Hard', 'film', 'Olympus', 'Has', 'Fallen', 'definitely', 'worse', 'lot', 'action', 'done', 'outside', 'as', 'well', 'inside', 'bound', 'be', 'lot', 'special', 'effects', 'majority', 'movie', ""'re"", 'obviously', 'not', 'going', 'shoot', 'down', 'bunch', 'helicopters', 'just', 'make', 'authentic', ""'re"", 'also', 'not', 'going', 'run', 'plane', 'Washington', 'Monument', 'understand', 'budget', ""n't"", 'large', 'enough', 'make', 'look', 'good', 'then', ""n't"", 'something', 'should', 'be', 'kept', 'film', 'Most', 'big', 'set', 'pieces', 'looked', 'CGI', 'was', 'ripped', 'ten', 'year', 'old', 'movie.Performance', 'wise', 'get', 'what', 'can', 'expect', 'action-flick', 'not', 'terrible', 'amount', 'emotion', 'characters', 'dialogue', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'blown', 'away', 'performances', 'said', 'Butler', 'Yune', 'played', 'roles', 'well', 'Butler', 'almost', 'always', 'enjoyable', 'films', 'Yune', 'was', 'able', 'be', 'intimidating', 'terribly', 'menacing', 'same', 'time', 'Eckhart', 'was', 'ok', 'definitely', 'was', ""n't"", 'performance', 'career', 'most', 'part', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'dialogue', 'character', 'was', 'annoyingly', 'spineless', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Speaker', 'House', 'Allan', 'Trumbull', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'screen-time', 'make', 'much', 'impact.Overall', 'Score', '7/10', 'Olympus', 'Has', 'Fallen', 'being', 'mindless', 'action', 'flick', 'be', 'anything', 'more', 'story', ""n't"", 'overly', 'interesting', 'can', 'become', 'predictable', 'times', 'Then', 'dated', 'visual', 'effects', 'emotionless', 'acting', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'add', 'overall', 'enjoyment', 'film', 'Still', 'enjoyable', 'what', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'unique', 'fun', 'adrenaline', 'rush', 'have', 'time', 'kill', 'then', 'would', 'recommend', 'giving', 'shot', ""n't"", 'something', 'should', 'go', 'way', 'see']",N/A

The casting is excellent, the story is sufficiently believable, and the location is great.So, I'll start with location. Shreveport, LA has become a film mecca. This must be Gerard Butler's third or fourth film here, this one his co-production (or with several producers). Butler plays Mike Banning, a Secret Service man who loses the president's wife early in the story and is ostracized to the Treasury Department, not his fault, but because of bad memories. This position leaves Banning in a situation to save the day, so to speak. I've seen Butler in all his movies and think this is his second best role (after ""300""). His face is showing age, a good thing in this film because it makes him experienced. Anyway, when he walks down a street, I recognized my hometown's streets and trees. That makes for a fun movie, looking for local places.Many previous reviewers compared ""Olympus Has Fallen"" with the ""Die Hard"" series. I suppose the comparison can be made--the lone police official miked in to outside support and becoming an inevitable hero. Butler has a number of heroic, bold lines comparable to Willis's lines. Yeah, I must agree, the comparison is legit.Aaron Eckhert plays the president well enough, with good ol' Morgan Freeman as acting president. However, the most significant aspect of the film is the plot by a Korean terrorist group to take over the White House (Olympus has fallen). Since ads reveal all this, I have not. My vote for best actor of the film is Rick Yune, the Korean leader.My biggest problem with the movie is the love story between Banning and his wife. There was no spark there at all. I found it a bit disturbing. Apparently, this was a couple at their plodding point, so I'm not sure why it was included.If you're a Butler fan, a follower of political intrigue and evil plots, love a good action flick, ""Olympus Has Fallen"" is a wise use of your time and money.",5,What an exciting action movie!,1376697600,"08 17, 2013",2013,1985,"['Olympus', 'Has', 'Fallen', 'definitely', 'worth', 'time', 'viewing', 'maybe', 'even', 'three', 'times', 'casting', 'excellent', 'story', 'sufficiently', 'believable', 'location', 'great.So', ""'ll"", 'start', 'location', 'Shreveport', 'LA', 'become', 'film', 'mecca', 'must', 'be', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'third', 'fourth', 'film', 'here', 'one', 'co-production', 'several', 'producers', 'Butler', 'Mike', 'Banning', 'Secret', 'Service', 'man', 'who', 'president', 'wife', 'early', 'story', 'ostracized', 'Treasury', 'Department', 'not', 'fault', 'bad', 'memories', 'position', 'Banning', 'situation', 'save', 'day', 'so', 'speak', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Butler', 'movies', 'think', 'second', 'best', 'role', '300', 'face', 'showing', 'age', 'good', 'thing', 'film', 'experienced', 'Anyway', 'when', 'walks', 'down', 'street', 'recognized', 'hometown', 'streets', 'trees', 'fun', 'movie', 'looking', 'local', 'places.Many', 'previous', 'reviewers', 'compared', 'Olympus', 'Has', 'Fallen', 'Die', 'Hard', 'series', 'suppose', 'comparison', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'lone', 'police', 'official', 'miked', 'outside', 'support', 'becoming', 'inevitable', 'hero', 'Butler', 'number', 'heroic', 'bold', 'lines', 'comparable', 'Willis', 'lines', 'Yeah', 'must', 'agree', 'comparison', 'legit.Aaron', 'Eckhert', 'president', 'well', 'enough', 'good', 'ol', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'acting', 'president', 'However', 'most', 'significant', 'aspect', 'film', 'plot', 'Korean', 'terrorist', 'group', 'take', 'over', 'White', 'House', 'Olympus', 'fallen', 'ads', 'reveal', 'have', 'not', 'vote', 'best', 'actor', 'film', 'Rick', 'Yune', 'Korean', 'leader.My', 'biggest', 'problem', 'movie', 'love', 'story', 'Banning', 'wife', 'was', 'spark', 'there', 'found', 'bit', 'disturbing', 'Apparently', 'was', 'couple', 'plodding', 'point', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'was', 'included.If', ""'re"", 'Butler', 'fan', 'follower', 'political', 'intrigue', 'evil', 'plots', 'love', 'good', 'action', 'flick', 'Olympus', 'Has', 'Fallen', 'wise', 'use', 'time', 'money']",N/A

It has a fanatic terrorist,several goons, a hostage standoff, an obvious twist. There however is no offbeat sidekick to the main star, like a die hard movie would have.It very much an action movie. Limited on character development, and with several plot elements that are a bit obvious. But you are not watching for Shakespeare are you? No you want explosions, fighting, and bad guys getting taken out. This movie has all that. After the first 20 minutes or so, there is some kind of fight every 5 minutes or so for the remainder of the movie.

The characters are interesting, and decently developed (i.e. they won't win character development awards but they are believable in the movie's context).The film features a low-frequency heavy DTS-MA audio track, with solid explosions, 360 range of bullet fire, and generally clear dialogue (a bit low on the volume scale for my tastes but with ""night mode"" on my receiver, it brought this a bit more in line). The movie was fun and kept me interested, whether as I was ducking under my coffee table with the sound of a bullet flying by or my breathing slowing as the character sneaks.The video was good, presented in a well saturated 1080P. It was generally a dark movie though filled with some bright moments. For this reason it may be best to watch the movie in a dark room or at night so that the textures in the darkness aren't washed out by sunlight on the TV.Overall, while enjoyable this movie isn't something I would go back to. The movie was good, and features a Die Hard-esque plot (one man vs. incredible odds) which is predictable once you get a quarter of the way into the movie. The characters are fun and they had my interest, but I never found myself truly ""routing"" for any characters. I couldn't get behind them fully as I never felt I understood the villains motives.

It's almost believable in how the terrorists take over the White House, given the technology that is actually available allowed them the ability to plan and time everything and the ability of terrorists and traitors to infiltrate themselves into just about every aspect of society.It's pretty formulaic for the genre of this type of movie - the good guys think they're too good and secure in what they do, the bad guys prove them wrong and have their initial triumph and approach pulling off their nefarious. then the good guys prevail. The acting is well done and the dialog doesn't break down into a lot of the clich&eacute;'s so prevalent in so many good guy/bad guy flicks out today. There's plenty of action and if you like shooting, fighting, blood splatter and violence there is enough to keep you happy, but not so much that it's over the top and gratuitous.As far as the quality of the video it is sharp and clear, and the sound was great on my 5.1 surround system.

The plot here is beyond pathetic, and far beyond remotely believable.The President of the USA travels with this little protection?The White House is this porous and easy to break into?Secret Service agents are this lame and moronic and unprofessional?Best of all, North Korean terrorists are this expert and well-funded and able to breach DC airspace and then the White House etc in minutes?Pull the other one.Wait, you already pulled three!I like Butler and Eckhard in most of their movies and they save this from being a total dumper, but they must have been paid a fortune along with VisaVoiceTM to make OHF. The dialogue is so weak, the premise so ridiculous and the plot so laughable that I couldn't believe this was made by the same guy who did the fabulous Training Day. Fuqua really hits a new nadir here.But if you're willing to accept that this is a truly stupid film in most every way, the action is passable enough to be entertaining. The problem is, this film takes itself very seriously, and wants us to as well, and often feels like propaganda for the Endless War On Freedom, or terror, or whatever they're calling it lately. As long as we all feel Fear, all day every day, and will accept whatever police state we need to Save Us!From the expert North Korean terrorists??!!They can barely find enough to eat for their leaders there, let alone the civilians, who we should be helping with our military money, and the billions wasted on making chumpass flicks like this.The more I think about this joke of a movie the worse it gets. Mainly because, unlike its infinitely superior predecessor Die Hard, Olympus has zero sense of humor, and plays all its moronic plot straight as a plastic arrow. Independent movies are bound to get more and more popular if Hollywood keeps spending fortunes on idiotic trash like OHF.Watch Die Hard for the tenth time long before you even consider renting this.

They did that with good acting, good visual effects and with total disregard for honesty. In other words, they plainly stole the book, changed a few things and sold the movie. I understand that shady practices permeate the movie industry, but this one was too much. Besides all that, it was very difficult to ignore the obvious stupidity of the officials portrayed. The president was a pansy, acting like a child. He didn't suck his thumb, but almost did. And, worst, they script him delivering a patriotic speech at the end of the movie. It will turn your stomach. If that is our government behaviour under terrorist attack, we should move to another country. Fortunately Gerard Butler saves the day. I'm sure real life Secret Service agents are pretty much like his character. He makes the movie watchable. Morgan Freeman does a creditable job as Speaker of the House. His best scene is when he berates a general. That was great. The rest of he cast performs well trying to survive a script lacking in believability. The terrorists are the best and one feels happy to see them dying. Hollywood: learn from Vince Flynn and pay attention to this: we, the United States of America, do not deal with terrorists under any circumstances, we do not cave to their demands, we do not negotiate with them and, most of all, we will fight them to the death if necessary.

1628107,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00BEIYHO2,Mark Turner,"[1, 1]","Hollywood has seemed more interested in making films that appear patriotic but at the same time take cheap shots at this country at the same time. It is rare that instead they do what movie makers did in the past by celebrating the spirit of this country. RED DAWN was an example of that. Now they've come out with a movie that will stir the soul of all American's watching.OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN stars Gerard Butler as Mike Banning, a secret service agent in charge of the security of President Benjamin Asher (Aaron Eckhart). Banning has a special place in the hearts of the first family including young son Conner (Finley Jacobson). As the film opens an accident on an icy bridge results in the death of the first lady (Ashley Judd) as Banning rescues the President.Time goes by and Banning is now assigned to the Treasury Department and a desk job. While the President holds no grudge Mike's presence is a reminder of what happened. Waiting for a chance to return to the field, Mike stays in touch with his boss Lynn Jacobs (Angela Bassett). Through no fault of his own, that chance will soon become available.Early in the day when the ambassador from North Korea comes to the White House for a meeting, an attack is launched on the building. A low flying military plane shoots down citizens left and right as well as guards and soldiers all over the White House grounds before it is hit and crashes through the Washington Monument. With bodies lying all around a land force then crashes the fence, plants a blockade at the entrances and begins an assault on the building and those protecting it.Having run to the White House once he was aware of what was going on, Banning makes his way through bad guys taking them out as he heads to the front doors. But these bad guys are on top of things and with RPGs and heavy artillery take out most of the agents in charge of protecting the building. Soon the White House falls before help can arrive. But they don't know that Banning has made his way inside.As all of this goes on outside the President, his entourage and the Koreans head to the bunker in the basement. It is here that the Korean ambassador is killed by his team, a group of terrorists led by Kang (Rick Yune) who now takes the American's hostage and then contacts those now in charge led by Speaker of the House Trumbull (Morgan Freeman). His demands are for the 7th Fleet to remove themselves from Asian waters and for troops on the demilitarized zone in Korea to begin withdrawal.All the while Banning continues to make his way through the building in search of Connor. With his access to codes and knowledge of the building he establishes contact with Trumbull and the assembled team trying to bring this crisis to an end. Banning is their only hope and the only person inside who can give them information. But can he rescue Connor, the President and stop the annihilation that Kang has in store for the world?This is a picture that pulls no punches and turns the non-stop, palm sweating action up to eleven. There is never a time in this movie when you stop and wish you had the remote in hand with your finger on the fast forward button. Even the second time around this movie rocks with enough mind blowing excitement to please the most jades action film fan.Butler shows why he's so good in roles like this. He offers the sophisticated look of an agent when needed but brings on the tough guy heroics in such a believable fashion that you can't help but root for him from the get go. This is the type of hero that everyone would hope was around and guarding the President. If you were forced to choose between Banning and Jack Bauer you'd be hard pressed to decide who you wanted next to you.Scenes of the Washington Monument and the White House being bombed or blown apart will wrench your heart as will the sight of the United States flag being tossed to the ground, shot to pieces. There is no way not to recall the events of 9/11 while watching this film and it makes you consider the fact that there are and most likely always will be enemies of this country waiting for the chance to do us harm. Let's just hope that if they were to attempt something like this that there are plenty of real life heroes out there to stop them cold in their tracks.

Superheroes, science fiction (and I'm talking Transformers not District 9) or apocalyptic action seem to be dominating the scene. Nothing wrong with these films, but the glory days of the films that made the stars of the Expendables famous, pure action films, are gone. Die Hard, Air Force One, Commando, these films aren't really made as much anymore.Which is why I'm glad this movie is made. And it's also made well. It's a 70 million dollar action flick, and in this day and age, that's cheap. It's not an attempt to start or continue a franchise, it's just a straightforward self-contained and while contrived, ORIGINAL, film. Terrorists take over the White House, John McClane stand-in Gerard Butler takes them out. Spectacle, visual, and violence ensue. And the film thankfully doesn't pull it's punches. It's hard hitting, violent, and exactly what we needed to fill in that gap.It's a solid film. The acting is fine, the characters don't make retarded decisions left and right. It's not the greatest movie ever but it's exactly what it wants to be. Worst part of the movie is some scenes are pretty poorly lit and it's hard to see what's going on.

1628133,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B00BEIYHO2,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[0, 0]","'Olympus Has Fallen' begins with former Special Forces and current Secret Service agent Mike Banning (Gergard Butler) assigned to Presidential Detail when things go horribly wrong. He is close friends with President Benjamin Asher (Aaron Eckhart), First Lady Margaret (Ashley Judd) and their son Connor (Finley Jacobsen), which makes it all the more wrenching when a freak accident on Christmas causes the President's car to swerve off a bridge. Only the President and his son survive.  Banning's failure to save the First Lady haunts his conscience and his career.Eighteen months later, Banning has been transferred to the Treasury Department, just a working schlub pushing papers like the rest of us. But it's a good thing he's near the White House, because during a visit by South Korean Prime Minister Lee Tae-Woo (Keong Sim), North Korea conducts an all-out assault on the White House grounds, while treasonous agents assigned to the Prime Minister attack from within. As garbage trucks laden with chain guns open fire, helicopters enter White House airspace while destroying their fighter escorts, and every failsafe fails, 'Olympus Has Fallen' gleefully just keeps upping the destruction in the hope you don't notice how ridiculous it all is.What ensues is a series of tense standoffs as the unknown agent working behind enemy lines -- Banning -- singlehandedly takes out the bad guys while redeeming himself in the eyes of the President. He starts out with nothing but his bare hands, but slowly makes his way up the villain food chain until he's foiling a plot that could threaten the security of the entire U.S. And oh yeah, there's a gun-wielding robot called Hydra 6 that shows up on the White House roof at one point.It's hard to be too angry at &#34;Olympus Has Fallen,&#34; because it just follows in the tradition of average Joe vs. sophisticated villains.  We've only seen poor imitations of this anti-hero since Bruce Willis' &#34;Die Hard&#34; debuted -- which are now parodied by Willis himself in later sequels.  Thing is, Willis' John McClane was only part of the formula.  You need the usual ingredients: brilliant bad guys with multi-layered schemes, bumbling authorities who are unprepared, and victims caught in the crossfire that are more important than they might at first appear.  But most importantly the film must take itself deadly seriously.  Part of the fun of &#34;Die Hard&#34; is feeling that the odds are so against McClane, despite the fact that we know he's going to succeed anyway.Butler can't quite pull off Willis' level of rough charisma, and the film isn't willing to torture Banning more than the flashback to loss of the First Lady.  The plot is patently absurd (from the Cerberus protocols to the gunship robot, none of it makes a lick of sense), but it is executed with such relentless verve that you can't help but admire director Antoine Fuqua's enthusiasm.  That doesn't make this a good film, merely an entertaining one. If you're looking for a good old American good vs. Axis of Evil showdown, &#34;Olympus Has Fallen&#34; will do nicely.",3,"""Die Hard"" for millennials",1391299200,"02 2, 2014",2014,3092,"[""'Olympus"", 'Has', 'Fallen', 'begins', 'former', 'Special', 'Forces', 'current', 'Secret', 'Service', 'agent', 'Mike', 'Banning', 'Gergard', 'Butler', 'assigned', 'Presidential', 'Detail', 'when', 'things', 'go', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'close', 'friends', 'President', 'Benjamin', 'Asher', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'First', 'Lady', 'Margaret', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'son', 'Connor', 'Finley', 'Jacobsen', 'more', 'wrenching', 'when', 'freak', 'accident', 'Christmas', 'President', 'car', 'swerve', 'off', 'bridge', 'Only', 'President', 'son', 'survive', 'Banning', 'failure', 'save', 'First', 'Lady', 'conscience', 'career.Eighteen', 'months', 'later', 'Banning', 'been', 'transferred', 'Treasury', 'Department', 'just', 'working', 'schlub', 'pushing', 'papers', 'rest', 'good', 'thing', 'White', 'House', 'visit', 'South', 'Korean', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Lee', 'Tae-Woo', 'Keong', 'Sim', 'North', 'Korea', 'all-out', 'assault', 'White', 'House', 'grounds', 'treasonous', 'agents', 'assigned', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'attack', 'garbage', 'trucks', 'laden', 'chain', 'guns', 'open', 'fire', 'helicopters', 'enter', 'White', 'House', 'airspace', 'destroying', 'fighter', 'escorts', 'failsafe', 'Has', 'Fallen', 'gleefully', 'just', 'keeps', 'upping', 'destruction', 'hope', 'do', ""n't"", 'notice', 'how', 'ridiculous', 'is.What', 'series', 'tense', 'standoffs', 'unknown', 'agent', 'working', 'enemy', 'lines', 'Banning', 'singlehandedly', 'out', 'bad', 'guys', 'redeeming', 'eyes', 'President', 'out', 'nothing', 'bare', 'hands', 'slowly', 'way', 'villain', 'food', 'chain', 'foiling', 'plot', 'could', 'threaten', 'security', 'entire', 'U.S.', 'oh', 'yeah', 'gun-wielding', 'robot', 'called', 'Hydra', '6', 'up', 'White', 'House', 'roof', 'one', 'point.It', 'hard', 'be', 'too', 'angry', '34', 'Olympus', 'Has', 'Fallen', '34', 'just', 'tradition', 'average', 'Joe', 'vs.', 'sophisticated', 'villains', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', 'poor', 'imitations', 'anti-hero', 'Bruce', 'Willis', '34', 'Die', 'Hard', '34', 'debuted', 'are', 'now', 'parodied', 'Willis', 'later', 'sequels', 'Thing', 'Willis', 'John', 'McClane', 'was', 'only', 'part', 'formula', 'need', 'usual', 'ingredients', 'brilliant', 'bad', 'guys', 'multi-layered', 'schemes', 'bumbling', 'authorities', 'who', 'are', 'unprepared', 'victims', 'caught', 'crossfire', 'are', 'more', 'important', 'might', 'first', 'appear', 'most', 'importantly', 'film', 'must', 'take', 'deadly', 'seriously', 'Part', 'fun', '34', 'Die', 'Hard', '34', 'feeling', 'odds', 'are', 'so', 'McClane', 'fact', 'know', 'going', 'succeed', 'anyway.Butler', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'pull', 'off', 'Willis', 'level', 'rough', 'charisma', 'film', ""n't"", 'willing', 'torture', 'Banning', 'more', 'flashback', 'loss', 'First', 'Lady', 'plot', 'patently', 'absurd', 'Cerberus', 'protocols', 'gunship', 'robot', 'none', 'lick', 'sense', 'executed', 'such', 'relentless', 'verve', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'admire', 'director', 'Antoine', 'Fuqua', 'enthusiasm', ""n't"", 'make', 'good', 'film', 'merely', 'entertaining', 'one', ""'re"", 'looking', 'good', 'old', 'American', 'good', 'vs.', 'Axis', 'Evil', 'showdown', '34', 'Olympus', 'Has', 'Fallen', '34', 'will', 'do', 'nicely']",N/A

1628138,A39SJ6V6QCGC37,B00BEIYHO2,Midge,"[0, 1]","This movie has serious issues which nearly ruined it. Eckhart was a rotten choice for president. His abrasive expressions & behavior ruined any potential for the audience to warm up or sympathize with his predicament. Frankly, his constant sour, raging face did not compel the audience to hope for his rescue & no one would have mourned his loss. Genuine terrorists would have shot him for his abrasive demeanor alone. His hateful expressions of a violent abusive AH just made you want to kick him where it would hurt most.  It increased his expendability. He did not fit this role & would have been better cast as a secret service agent.Melissa Leo as Sec of Defense wasn't any better. We were hoping for her early demise just to gain relief from her ridiculous, bad, over acting. Flailing around like wounded duck, wailing the pledge as they dragged her across the room. Her lines were the worst written. Whomever chose the actors for this cast should never work in the film industry again. They certainly did not know how to best match actors with roles. Eckhart probably would have been great as a SS agent or even the traitor agent but never a victim. Nor as a respectable leader of the country. Leo probably would have been fine as a cabinet member who was behind the scenes & not a hostage. She plays a rotten hostage as did Eckhart.Morgan Freeman had his usual compelling warmth, composure & charisma needed for the role of a president or speaker. Butler as Banning also did an excellent job in his role as an unstoppable Rambo agent. Butler & Freeman carried the entire movie, along with the supporting role played by Bassett. Without them, the movie would have been a miserable failure.The script also had several glaring issues so far apart from reality, it nearly ruined the movie. First was the President ordering his cabinet to give up their codes. No self respecting leader of the country would endanger entire nations & millions of people to save the lives of one or two cabinet secretaries. They are expected to die rather than give up those codes as is the President or any other leader. Even at the cost of their own families lives like on Failsafe. Giving up those codes as depicted was preposterously absurd. It was also equally absurd that any leader or country would kowtow to pulling troops or fleets or allow any other major risk to the country or Global security for the sake of one man. Even if that man was president. He is expendable & replaceable & never worth millions of lives or national security. The only way a concept like this would work is if there was a danger to an entire major city of millions. But even they would be expandable to save hundreds of millions more who would be endangered by complying with terrorist demands. A country cannot in reality, ever give into terrorist demands. Hesitating to send trained teams in to take down the terrorist for fear of harm to one man, even a President; while the codes for nukes were being activated, was simply unbelievable. He would be replaceable in the face of a catastrophic disaster. That office changes hands every 4 to 8 years as it is. How could anyone write such a weak depiction of such an event.It is also absurd to think we would have any critical system which does not have a secondary access point & more than one way to override, abort & change the codes. Anytime someone becomes a hostage, ALL codes, logins & user access would be immediately changed & locked out to prevent anyone from forcing access to those codes. No critical system would be isolated to a single access point which cannot be overridden. Much less a ridiculously prolonged abort code. Even a hardened bunker has com lines & power lines & data lines whether hard wired, sat, wireless to connect to external systems which could be disabled at the connection points under emergency conditions. Password code breaker software would never work because most of these systems will lock out after 3 bad attempts & require a major reset before any further attempts would be accepted. Just like your bank. So the mere aspect of someone running code breaker Software to access a password in the defense system is utterly laughable.A truly poor job of scriptwriting & directing.Some final pet peeves were the first lady saying it was ok for her son to wear a baseball hat with his tuxedo. I would expect the first family to know basic etiquette of never wearing a hat indoors & not portraying poor taste. And finally, having the first family attending a billionaire's party fundraiser on Christmas eve & transporting them in dangerous weather conditions was simply unbelievable that anyone would write such an absurd scenario. No self respecting presidential family would spend their Christmas eve at some party fundraiser on Christmas eve, nor would their security detail drive them in such weather.I would only expect such unrealistic writing & directing from a Total novice. There was also a total lack of storyline research into the security systems & design of the white house such as we saw on White House Down. Even with Butler & Freeman's excellent performances, the writing & directing nearly ruined it such as having Butler repeatedly wandering the same halls near the front door & never getting near the Peoc or basement until the finale. Or having Morgan Freeman giving into the terrorists & pulling troops & fleets for the sake of one man even if he was president. The concept is utterly ridiculous.Their only saving grace was the popularity of Freeman & the excellence of Butler's performance.",3,Has serious issues,1386806400,"12 12, 2013",2013,5568,"['movie',

1628147,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00BEIYHO2,M. Oleson,"[0, 0]","Director Antoine Fuqua (""Shooter"") digs deeply into his bag of American jingoism and flaunts it proudly in this action thriller.  With what appears to be a 13 minute cakewalk, a band of 50 or 60 North Koreans manage to take out hundreds of civilians by air while at the same time infiltrating the White House, arguably the most protected building in the world.  The ensuing gun violence goes on for many minutes and quite frankly, is nauseating.  I suspect the secret service wasn't too happy with this film or perhaps were just laughing hysterically.As preposterous as the premise is, once the story shifts to former presidential ""body man"" Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) things get more interesting.  Years earlier, Banning was assigned to protect President Asher (a grimacing Aaron Eckhart) and his family.  Ater tragedy struck during a snow storm, Banning took a desk job at the Treasury Department.  By coincidence he becomes involved in the battle at the White House and manages to get inside.  The prez and much of his senior staff get to the underground bunker but once again, somehow those North Korean evil-doers manage to have the sophistication to get past the security and put even more bullets into more people's heads.  They have some inside help of course from both South Korea and the White House.  You can pick out the traitors just by watching their faces.  Terrible acting.Rick Yune is pretty good as Kang, the NK's Kang leader (sorry, I couldn't help myself).  Hell, he seems to have more knowledge of American history, especially surrounding the White House, than the vast majority of Americans.  And he speaks perfect English.  Banning once inside, works with acting president/Speaker of the House Trumbull (Morgan Freeman) and the national security team to free Asher before Kang tortures certain security codes from him.  This all works well as the indefatigable and unbeatable Banning disposes of Kang's gang one at a time.  We know where this is all headed of course and the final scenes include a speech exuding a ""why can't we all get along"" mantra.  This is a by-the-numbers action flick with a dumb premise, excessive violence but a gritty performance by Butler makes it almost worthwhile.This Blu ray disc comes in 1080p video resolution and a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  While the display may not be of demo quality it is quite acceptable.  Scenes are clear with good contrast.  Colors are generally good although I did notice one scene in low light that seemed uneven.  None of this is a big deal but might be noticeable to some viewers.  The audio includes a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track and it is excellent.  There were several scenes of heavy cross-fire and I felt like I was in the middle ducking bullets.  During the scenes involving heavy dialog, everything felt very normal yet immersive.

After a horrible accident results in the death of the first lady (Ashley Judd), Banning is removed from the detail and placed in a government desk job. Haunted and guilt-ridden from the accident, Banning is suddenly forced back into action when the White House is attacked by North Korean terrorists and the President (Aaron Eckhart, ""The Dark Knight"") is taken hostage. Racing against time and an increasingly violent terrorist leader (Rick Yune ""The Fast and The Furious), Banning must use his special skills to save the President-and the nation.The action film is probably the easiest genre to sell to audiences-as long as it has these three things: a big-name cast, an impressive CGI sequence and some well-choreographed fight scenes. This film is certainly not lacking in any of these. So why doesn't it work? Well, it's because there are two kinds of action films. The first kind uses these elements alongside a solid script and decent actors to deliver a fun and entertaining experience for the audience (Die Hard, Jurassic Park). The second kind of action film simply takes these three elements and uses them to distract the audience from realizing that there is no script or story. This film is, without a doubt, the latter.With the exception of the first five minutes, every scene of this film is dedicated to impressing the audience with how big its budget is and how great its cast.  The film does have an amazing cast, from Eckhart (who everyone knows as Two-Face from ""The Dark Knight"") to Morgan Freeman as Speaker of the House. The problem is that everyone in this film was obviously cast to sell theatre tickets because none of them are given anything to do other than occasionally deliver a cheesy line or just look distressed at the camera. How they got Freeman to be in this movie is a mystery because he doesn't do anything other than just look around with a solemn look on his face. Either he was promised 50% of the film's profits or he was being held hostage himself.The acting in this film, or lack thereof, is another issue entirely. The actors in the film must have known that they were only here for marketing reasons because every performance feels phoned-in and uninspired. Gerard Butler and Aaron Eckhart are especially painful to watch here because both of these men have proven themselves to be good actors. However, whatever talent any of these actors may have is wasted here because this script doesn't give these characters any depth for the actors to draw from.The real problem with this film is that it is built on a premise that is so implausible to begin with that the whole film seems like a waste of effort. This movie makes attacking the White House look like a walk in the park, not to mention that it makes every aspect of the US defense system look completely inept. In order to enjoy this movie, you have to believe that not only is the White House security force made up of fifteen guys on the roof, but that the CIA doesn't perform background checks on people who they allow in a room with the President. The entire movie is made up this kind of absurdity to the point where it becomes flat-out silly.While this is the very definition of a bad action film, there are some redeeming qualities that, at the very least, make the film watchable. There is a CGI sequence in the first fifteen minutes of the film that is truly jaw-dropping, even though it's tragic that it's attached to this movie. There are also some solid performances from Angela Bassett (""How Stella Got Her Groove Back"") and Melissa Leo (""The Fighter""). Basset especially does the best she can with the throw-away role she is given. Also, the first five minutes, while still whopping with cheese, is the only part of this film that depicts any kind of emotion and it does make you anxious about where the film is going to go from there.While this film did have potential, what few good aspects it does have are not enough to save it from being, even at its best moments, just plain mediocre. ""Olympus Has Fallen"" is a failed effort at what could have been a really fun Die Hard-like experience that had more going for it than a great action sequence and some unintentional humor. Wait for the DVD or better yet, watch the CGI sequence on YouTube because other than that, there is nothing fun or memorable about this film.",2,'Olympus' Delivers Explosive Effects--But Nothing More,1364256000,"03 26, 2013",2013,4904,"['Olympus', 'fallen', 'Olympus', 'fallen', 'Well', 'so', 'chance', 'remaining', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'be', 'serious', 'action', 'star', 'Seriously', 'time', 'Butler', 'find', 'new', 'gimmick', 'least', 'new', 'agent', 'guy', 'been', 'riding', 'off', 'success', '300', 'past', '7', 'years', 'career', 'right-', '300', 'came', '7', 'years', 'ago', 'one', 'mediocre', 'action', 'flick', 'Olympus', 'Has', 'Fallen', 'exception.This', 'film', 'story', 'Special', 'Forces', 'operative', 'Michael', 'Banning', 'Butler', 'who', 'member', 'US', 'President', 'personal', 'detail', 'horrible', 'accident', 'results', 'death', 'first', 'lady', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'Banning', 'removed', 'detail', 'placed', 'government', 'desk', 'job', 'Haunted', 'guilt-ridden', 'accident', 'Banning', 'suddenly', 'forced', 'back', 'action', 'when', 'White', 'House', 'attacked', 'North', 'Korean', 'terrorists', 'President', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'taken', 'hostage', 'Racing', 'time', 'increasingly', 'violent', 'terrorist', 'leader', 'Rick', 'Yune', 'Fast', 'Furious', 'Banning', 'must', 'use', 'special', 'skills', 'save', 'President-and', 'nation.The', 'action', 'film', 'probably', 'easiest', 'genre', 'sell', 'audiences-as', 'long', 'three', 'things', 'big-name', 'cast', 'impressive', 'CGI', 'sequence', 'well-choreographed', 'fight', 'scenes', 'film', 'certainly', 'not', 'lacking', 'So', 'why', ""n't"", 'work', 'Well', 'are', 'two', 'kinds', 'action', 'films', 'first', 'kind', 'elements', 'alongside', 'solid', 'script', 'decent', 'actors', 'deliver', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'experience', 'audience', 'Die', 'Hard', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'second', 'kind', 'action', 'film', 'simply', 'three', 'elements', 'distract', 'audience', 'realizing', 'script', 'story', 'film', 'doubt', 'latter.With', 'exception', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'scene', 'film', 'dedicated', 'impressing', 'audience', 'how', 'big', 'budget', 'how', 'great', 'cast', 'film', 'have', 'amazing', 'cast', 'Eckhart', 'who', 'everyone', 'Two-Face', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Speaker', 'House', 'problem', 'everyone', 'film', 'was', 'obviously', 'cast', 'sell', 'theatre', 'tickets', 'none', 'are', 'given', 'anything', 'do', 'other', 'occasionally', 'deliver', 'cheesy', 'line', 'just', 'look', 'distressed', 'camera', 'How', 'got', 'Freeman', 'be', 'movie', 'mystery', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'other', 'just', 'look', 'around', 'solemn', 'look', 'face', 'was', 'promised', '50', '%', 'film', 'profits', 'was', 'being', 'held', 'hostage', 'himself.The', 'acting', 'film', 'lack', 'thereof', 'issue', 'entirely', 'actors', 'film', 'must', 'have', 'known', 'were', 'only', 'here', 'marketing', 'reasons', 'performance', 'phoned-in', 'uninspired', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'are', 'especially', 'painful', 'watch', 'here', 'men', 'have', 'proven', 'be', 'good', 'actors', 'However', 'talent', 'actors', 'may', 'have', 'wasted', 'here', 'script', ""n't"", 'give', 'characters', 'depth', 'actors', 'draw', 'from.The', 'real', 'problem', 'film', 'built', 'premise', 'so', 'implausible', 'begin', 'whole', 'film', 'waste', 'effort', 'movie', 'attacking', 'White', 'House', 'look', 'walk', 'park', 'not', 'mention', 'aspect', 'US', 'defense', 'system', 'look', 'completely', 'inept', 'order', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'have', 'believe', 'not', 'only', 'White', 'House', 'security', 'force', 'made', 'fifteen', 'guys', 'roof', 'CIA', ""n't"", 'perform', 'background', 'checks', 'people', 'who', 'allow', 'room', 'President', 'entire', 'movie', 'made', 'up', 'kind', 'absurdity', 'point', 'where', 'flat-out', 'silly.While', 'very', 'definition', 'bad', 'action', 'film', 'are', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'very', 'least', 'make', 'film', 'watchable', 'CGI', 'sequence', 'first', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'film', 'truly', 'jaw-dropping', 'even', 'tragic', 'attached', 'movie', 'are', 'also', 'solid', 'performances', 'Angela', 'Bassett', 'How', 'Stella', 'Got', 'Her', 'Groove', 'Back', 'Melissa', 'Leo', 'Fighter', 'Basset', 'especially', 'best', 'can', 'throw-away', 'role', 'given', 'Also', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'still', 'whopping', 'cheese', 'only', 'part', 'film', 'kind', 'emotion', 'make', 'anxious', 'where', 'film', 'going', 'go', 'there.While', 'film', 'did', 'have', 'potential', 'what', 'few', 'good', 'aspects', 'have', 'are', 'not', 'enough', 'save', 'being', 'even', 'best', 'moments', 'just', 'plain', 'mediocre', 'Olympus', 'Has', 'Fallen', 'failed', 'effort', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'fun', 'Die', 'Hard-like', 'experience', 'had', 'more', 'going', 'great', 'action', 'sequence', 'unintentional', 'humor', 'Wait', 'DVD', 'better', 'yet', 'watch', 'CGI', 'sequence', 'YouTube', 'other', 'nothing', 'fun', 'memorable', 'film']",N/A

1628197,AXYJ9QJYS3S78,B00BEIYHO2,pastapadre,"[30, 36]","Olympus Has Fallen is the first of two films this year that has a plot centered on the White House being assaulted. Purely set up as an all-out action film it succeeds by setting a chaotic and dire stage and never letting off the gas. It's more Die Hard than A Good Day to Die Hard was.Gerard Butler stars as a former Secret Service agent who finds himself in the midst of the takeover and as the only person in a position to put an end to it. A rogue North Korean faction takes control of the White House and with it the President hostage putting the group's leader in a position of leverage to make demands that would allow North Korea to invade South Korea and ultimately bring down the United States by another means.While the CGI shows flaws in certain instances it was still believable enough. The scope of the set pieces was more notable. What really established Olympus as more than just a bland action movie was the intensity of the scenes and the gravity of the events taking place that was reflected through them.The takeover sequence was not just visually powerful but creatively planned out. There were many moving parts to it which made it seem at least semi-plausible. The close-combat scenes were visceral with some brutal kills. While its no The Raid: Redemption in that sense it was a much harder ""R"" than anticipated.Aaron Eckhart plays the President and if he comes across as a tad weak it's probably because of movies like Air Force One where the POTUS refuses to give an inch and fights back no matter the circumstances. Eckhart's performance considers the personal loss he has gone through and seeing others face death right in front of him - leaving the fighting to those who are trained for it. Morgan Freeman is the Speaker of the House and assumes the role as President during the situation. He's pretty much what one would expect from Freeman in such a leadership role, though refreshingly he didn't have all the answers either.Olympus Has Fallen is an action film that feels as though it could have belonged in the 80&#8242;s or 90&#8242;s.

He appeared again in 'Die Hard in an Airport'. We got the bigger but dumber Seven Segal next in 'Die Hard on a Battleship' followed by 'Die Hard on Train. Now we have Gerard Butler who is big and muscular in 'Die Hard in the White House'. He seems to be a composite of the best parts of the other  'Die Harders'.Butler is a fine Die Harder. He still has most of the muscle mass he put on for that Greek cartoon movie he made. He seems athletic although he never actually does anything that is athletic. Segal was choreographed in a lot of action scenes in his Die Hard Movies but he was always very stiff and implausible. The odd thing was that he was - at least when he was young - pretty competent in martial arts. Butler is better.What makes a good Die Harder? Apparently it's the ability to never be hit by machine gun fire. Butler in scene after scene runs through a hail storm of lead and is unscathed. Yet he makes it all seem plausible.

I cannot say why without giving things away, even if it is an action flick there are still some pretty cool twists here and there you may or may not see coming.The plot and the way the White House is taken is pure fantasy, if you can just get that in your head now you can enjoy the movie. Not cheesy, but just not realistic either. If you are military minded at all you will know some of the things that happen in this movie just won't take place in real life. Now that's out of the way, we can enjoy this well done action flick.It is all about the actors and the characters here and what drives them. This isn't some silly one man army hero doing things for truth, justice, and the America way. Banning (Gerard Butler) really cares about the people he is protecting and the sanctity of what the White House is, and what he does during his heroics are real enough with some great fights scenes.

It's an action flick and settles comfortably into that role.  But while it was settling itself down, it became something a bit more than an action film.  I don't know what to call that, but it's not your standard action flick.  Of course, casting Morgan Freeman in your movie is rarely a mistake.  I've seen Gerad Butler in a few films and he's done a good job over the course of his career, including his performance here.  While I have trouble believing that the President of the United States would be put in half the dangerous situations he finds himself in this movie, I saw Mr. Butler genuinely wanting to see to his safety.  On that note, I am not completely sold by Aaron Eckhart's performance...he often seemed too calm for situations where a normal human being, even the President, might not be so calm.  Did I miss the scene where he got the power of super calmness...I just remember the film starting with him getting his butt kicked in a friendly boxing session with Mr. Butler (that was boxing, right?)  As for Ashley Jud, I am a big fan and feel cheated by how little she was in the film...bring her back in a flashback or something...come on!

A military grade airplane enters DC airspace without authorization and the US fighter planes that intercept keep warning and warning and warning and warning and warning and warning that if the plane doesn't turn back it will be shot down until the unknown plane shoots them down.2. When said plane shoots up DC, people stand in the middle of the street and watch until they get shot.3. The White House is under attack and the Secret Service guys run into the lawn instead of running for cover. They also keep flooding out the front doors getting picked off in rapid succession like rats abandoning a sinking ship and yet they keep running out. Also, no SS or police are wearing bullet proof vests.4. The White House, which is described in the movie as the most secure building in the world, is easily taken over by terrorists. In the meantime, the military takes it's time getting there. The entire White House is taken over before they bother to show up.5. The only person who has managed to kill any of the terrorists is the hero of the movie because apparently he is the only trained SS officer. The rest are ripe for the picking.All of this is the first 15 minutes. It gets worse from there and the list is too long to type. It's a waste of money. It wasn't even worth the pleasure of watching the White House burn.",1,Olympus has fallen laughing,1376352000,"08 13, 2013",2013,1687,"['movie', 'started', 'out', 'interesting', 'first', '3', 'minutes', 'always', 'watch', 'movies', 'understanding', 'have', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'ridiculous', 'was', 'impossible', 'believe', 'even', 'one', 'minute', 'had', 'pause', 'movie', 'least', '30', 'times', 'ranting', 'how', 'stupid', 'warning', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'technical', 'terms', ':1', 'military', 'grade', 'airplane', 'enters', 'DC', 'airspace', 'authorization', 'US', 'fighter', 'planes', 'intercept', 'keep', 'warning', 'warning', 'warning', 'warning', 'warning', 'warning', 'plane', ""n't"", 'turn', 'back', 'will', 'be', 'shot', 'down', 'unknown', 'plane', 'shoots', 'down.2', 'When', 'said', 'plane', 'shoots', 'up', 'DC', 'people', 'stand', 'middle', 'street', 'watch', 'get', 'shot.3', 'White', 'House', 'attack', 'Secret', 'Service', 'guys', 'run', 'lawn', 'instead', 'running', 'cover', 'also', 'keep', 'flooding', 'out', 'front', 'doors', 'getting', 'picked', 'off', 'rapid', 'succession', 'rats', 'abandoning', 'sinking', 'ship', 'yet', 'keep', 'running', 'out', 'Also', 'SS', 'police', 'are', 'wearing', 'bullet', 'proof', 'vests.4', 'White', 'House', 'described', 'movie', 'most', 'secure', 'building', 'world', 'easily', 'taken', 'over', 'terrorists', 'meantime', 'military', 'time', 'getting', 'there', 'entire', 'White', 'House', 'taken', 'over', 'bother', 'show', 'up.5', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'managed', 'kill', 'terrorists', 'hero', 'movie', 'apparently', 'only', 'trained', 'SS', 'officer', 'rest', 'are', 'ripe', 'picking.All', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'worse', 'list', 'too', 'long', 'type', 'waste', 'money', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'worth', 'pleasure', 'watching', 'White', 'House', 'burn']",N/A

1628260,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B00BEIYHO2,RMurray847,"[1, 2]","OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN is like the TV Series 24 on some serious steroids and a BIG budget.  It also lacks compelling characters and a decent script.  But nonetheless, it has its moments and overall the moments I enjoyed slightly outweighed the dreadful.It started poorly.  We meet the president (Aaron Eckhart) as he boxes with his #1 Secret Service guy/friend (Gerard Butler).  In one little scene, their relationship is established and we also learn that the script will feature one clich&eacute; after another.  The camaraderie that feels forced.  The tough-as-nails president who can handle himself in a fight.  The toughened secret service guy with a heart of gold.  It all felt stale.  Then we meet the first lady (Ashley Judd), and the dialogue goes from bad to insipid.  Eckhart has a number of skills as an actor, but he&#8217;s often struggled to be the soft, romantic type.  He struggles mightily (not helped by his stupid lines of dialogue) and Judd isn&#8217;t much help.  They also have a young son (who you know right away will be in serious jeopardy soon), who happens to be great buddies with Butler.Then the first family is shown leaving Camp David, and some events occur that I hadn&#8217;t seen coming.  I expected something bad to happen, but the actual event caught me off guard, and was actually more effective that it had a right to be.  So I sat up and started paying some attention.Soon thereafter, the White House is attacked by well-armed, well-equipped Korean terrorists and their assault on the nation&#8217;s &#8220;home&#8221; is brutal, bloody, thorough and alarming.  It features huge piles of bullet and explosive ripped bodies, terrible special effects, an ineffectual military response and results in Butler being the only good-guy left standing in the White House.  The sequence is effective in that as an American, I find the destruction of our national heritage disturbing on a gut level.  The thoroughness of the attack is relentless and awful to contemplate.  But the scene, to be honest, would have been better if some of the special effects, particularly of the aircraft used, had been better.  The initial air assault is really hard to believe, made more so by the third-rate CGI.When the movie is a bit more down to earth, and dwells more on small fights and even some fisticuffs&#8230;it&#8217;s more gritty and believable.  And Butler, who has struggled in one bad movie after another since 300, is actually a decent action hero.  He can toss off quips if he needs to, but the movie gives him few&#8230;which is good.  The film tries hard not to feel like a DIE HARD rip-off&#8230;which is why it feels more like a 24 rip-off.I don&#8217;t want to say too much more about the plot specifics.  Most of the turns you will probably see coming (including who the traitors include), but there are a few that I didn&#8217;t see coming.  That&#8217;s always nice when watching a movie like this.On the other hand, the characters are all woe-fully underdeveloped.  We&#8217;ve got some good actors given very little to do.  These kinds of films often feature politicians and military-guys in &#8220;situation rooms,&#8221; doing essentially nothing.  Usually we get some big names to populate these roles, earning nice paychecks for minimal effort. But for some reason, this group of Angela Bassett, Robert Forster and Morgan Freeman is particularly bland.  Yes, Morgan Freeman is BLAND.  Only once, when yelling at some flunky, does he get to shine.  What a waste!  The female characters are REALLY bland, including Bassett, Radha Mitchell, and the usually stellar Melissa Leo as the Secretary of Defense (although her last scene is a bit of a nail-biter, her CHARACTER is still a cypher).  Eckhart is pretty bland&#8230;we get no sense of what kind of president he might be.  He&#8217;s the &#8220;generic&#8221; president.  Oh, and notice I haven&#8217;t mentioned the villains?  I&#8217;d already forgotten them&#8230;they are so vague and not scary.At the end of the film, as things are calming down, two characters walk out of the White House together.  All around them lay dead bodies&#8230;the secret service and police who were massacred.  Blood and debris are everywhere.  Smoke billows from the wreckage of the east wing.  In the foreground is the wreckage of a black hawk, which still contains its dead crew.  The two characters look at each other and survey their surroundings.  And then they make a joke.  It was offensively inappropriate, and it belonged in a different movie.  This is not a very jokey movie.  (See WHITE HOUSE DOWN for that.)  It plays mostly with a straight face, and its violence is very &#8220;R&#8221; rated.  I tell you all this, not so much to share my outrage at the insensitivity of this scene&#8230;but so you understand that the film is playing this story straight.  The plot is outrageous, and requires a significant amount of incompetence on the part of American law-enforcement and the military to buy&#8230;but the film does at least have enough ambition to try to horrify us with contemplating what an event like this might mean.  Thus, I give the film 3 full stars&#8230;rather than the 2 or 2.5 it might have received otherwise.",3,"Despite bad script and poorly developed characters, there is also some real excitement to be

It reminded me a lot of Seagal's ""Under Siege"", but the action and acting was much better here.I am not going to attempt to address the 1-star ratings here. If you read my reviews you know that I am a harsh critic that gives honest, fair assessments so that my fellow AMAZON shoppers can rely on my reviews for sure-footed guidance.Rather, I will tell you that this movie delivered far more than I expected from it. And frankly, I expected a lot with a cast that includes Freeman, Butler, Basset, Judd, Hauser, McDermott, Yune, and Eckhart.PARTIAL SPOILER ALERT!  It is a war movie more than anything, but not the typical war movie. The plot is fairly straight-forward, but this is not a mystery thriller. Some complained that it is predictable, aren't 99% of movies? We know the good guy will win and ride off into the sunset 99% of the time. This is one of those movies in which the good guy wins. I never expect the hero to be killed, so it is beyond me why that offended some viewers. But haters must hate I suppose.If you are looking for a very high-tension, suspenseful action movie with a tremendous amount of gunfire, explosions and hand-to-hand combat, this is the perfect movie for you. Did you see that M-word?  Yeah, it is a M O V I E!  So watch it without over thinking ""Gee would that really happen?""  Really?  Would a giant gorilla climb the Empire State Building and do battle with biplanes? Would a millionaire bachelor and his young legal ward dawn capes, masks, and tights, and set about fighting crime in Gotham City?

1628264,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B00BEIYHO2,Robert Badgley,"[1, 2]","Olympus has Fallen(released April/13)stars,among others,Gerard Butler as Mike Banning,Aaron Eckhart as President Benjamin Asher,Morgan Freeman as Speaker Allan Trumbull,Angela Bassett as Lynne Jacobs,Rick Yune as Kang Yeonsak,and Dylan McDermott as Dave Forbes.This film has so many plot holes and inconsistencies that you could fly an Apache helicopter through it and still have room for the 7th fleet trailing behind it!The story involves Butler as a member of the secret service assigned to protect the president.On the way to a function around Xmas time out of Camp David,during a violent snow storm,the lead vehicle in the presidents motorcade gets hit by a branch.The resulting swerving on the icy roads of all vehicles sends one over a bridge and into the river.The presidents own car perches precariously on the bridges edge,ready to follow suit.Butler races to the car and manages to pull the president out,leaving the first lady trapped in her seat belt,as the car plunges into the river below.Many months later Butler is sitting behind a desk doing other assigned duties at the agency.Into this scenario comes a radical North Korean group who are posing as employees of a delegation from South Korea visiting the president.As they meet a Hercules transport plane is inbound to the White House.It is intercepted over Washington by two Air Force jets,but they are easily taken down.Before any other response from the Air Force can be mustered the plane is circling the White House and tearing everyone and everything to pieces.Simultaneously,in the White House bunker far below the surface,the North Koreans in the delegation have killed their cohorts and have now taken the president and his team hostages.Also an outside and unseen group of Koreans has started attacking the White House from the outside and eventually make their way inside to take over the White House.Butler has seen the commotion from afar and has raced to the White House in time to join in the fire fight but not save many of his former colleagues.He gets inside and inadvertently becomes the eyes and ears of the officials in the Pentagon.Besides taking out as many hostiles as he can,his first major piece of business,once he has contacted the Pentagon,is to retrieve the presidents son,in hiding,and spirit him out of the White House into the safety of the military outside.From here it is a piecemeal battle all the way to get to the president himself.The man who leads these terrorists has a goal to obtain the Cerberus codes.These are codes which when inserted into the national defense computer,can arm or disarm the U.S.'s ICBM missiles.In this case,when he finally extracts the codes by force,he activates the missiles IN their silos and intends to blow them up where they stand.In addition he has gotten the Pentagon to OK the removal of U.S.troops from the DMZ between North and South Korea,and removal of the 7th Fleet in the region.He also creates a diversion aimed at fooling the Pentagon and outside world that the president has perished in a helicopter crash.Butler sees the crash but doesn't believe it true.He goes into the belly of the White House and finds that the terrorist leader is still alive and has the president.In the scuffle the president is shot but Butler finally kills the terrorist.The film ends as the president,now well,gives a heart warming speech about the U.S.,its belief system and the usual God bless America stuff;with a happy Butler now back serving the president as before.As my title says,this is a mind-less film.Mind less,not only in plot holes,but in the all important believability factor.If one cannot suspend disbelief long enough to buy what is going on on the screen,then the film will ultimately fail.And this falls into that category.It had plenty of potential but it just couldn't follow through.I will list some of the more obvious mistakes.The first faux paux is the plunge the presidents wife takes in the car into the river,played by Ashley Judd.After it goes over everyone is just sitting there in stunned disbelief.No cries of ""Get down there"" or""Send for divers"",or no one going down and into the river to even try to save the first lady.The secret service will give their lives to protect the president and his family.Not here.The second faux paux is the Hercules transport plane the Koreans commandeer and fly over Washington.There is no way that plane would have been able to get close enough to landfall let alone over the city before it was intercepted.This thing was well over the city before jets showed up.Once the first two planes were shot down by the transport,the second pair showed up in a flash.Funny that.The third item is how long it took the military to respond to the crisis.The Koreans said they took the White House in 13 minutes and the military showed up in 15.Now you are going to have me believe that in a situation like this the military would move like a snail and get there in an EXTREMELY tardy 15 long minutes? C'mon.The fourth item is the secret service agents and others defending the White House during the battle on the front lawn.In very unorthodox fashion,they are all standing there on the front steps like bowling pins,in a big group,like lambs to the slaughter.Not how the secret service or any military like group are trained.I could go on but I think you get the point.The only thing this film has going for it,fortunately,is Butler.I like Butler,and he again is ""in the zone"",for he and he alone makes you get behind his character.When he is roaming the interior of the White house looking for targets,you are with him and rooting for him,and the resultant action is good stuff to watch.This is the film's most appealing point.Otherwise,as I said,the situations all leading up to putting Butler where he ultimately gets to, are too far fetched for the thinking person to buy.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp.There are no extras.This is a definite trend,as I'm sure many of you are seeing.The more the powers that be want you to switch over to Blu Ray,the less extras they put on DVDs.I for one,am resisting switching.I mean how clear does ones picture have to get for gosh sakes? DVD is just fine for me thank you very much.All in all a disappointing film with a great cast.Butler does his best to save the day,and once we are over the totally unbelievable circumstances that get him to the meat of the film,he turns it into a decent action film...for a time.But it is the lack of suspension of disbelief for the first and most important part of this film,that drags it down.",3,Absoloutely mind-less film!,1379116800,"09 14, 2013",2013,6610,"['Olympus', 'Fallen', 'released', 'April/13', 'stars', 'others', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'Mike', 'Banning', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart',

1628272,A3CL2F9VXQOMTV,B00BEIYHO2,ROb,"[0, 0]",This movie was like a video game campaign.  It has one guy who essentially works his way through the white house.  It has stop and go action almost like he was playing chapters of a campaign.  It reminded me of a call of duty mission where you have to retake the white house.  The beginning with the AC130 I could easily believe but other than that it was too easy to take out all the security guarding the white house.  I guess they wouldn't have much of a movie if that part took too long though.  There are some good scenes when someone acts heroically.

Zwick,"[0, 0]","&#8220;Olympus Has Fallen&#8221; offers a veritable orgy of death and destruction, as a massive gang of amazingly coordinated North Korean terrorists lay siege to the White House and take the President (Aaron Eckhart) and many of his staff and cabinet members hostage.Gerard Butler plays a Secret Service agent who&#8217;s been sidelined since a tragedy befell the President&#8217;s family 18 months earlier while they were under his care. Turns out that single-handedly rescuing the President from a bunch of crazed, bloodthirsty terrorists may just be the opportunity he&#8217;s been looking for both to get back in the Commander-in-Chief&#8217;s good graces and to prove to himself that he still has what it takes to be a good agent (so what if half of Washington D.C. needs to be sacrificed to make the point? It&#8216;s all just collateral damage anyway, right?). Morgan Freeman steps into the breach in his customary reassuring-presence-in-a-time-of-crisis role, this time as the Speaker of the House who assumes the position of president while the Prez and Vice Prez are otherwise occupied. But Dylan McDermott, as a traitorous Secret Service agent, seems to be stuck in a bit of a career rut of late, what with this role and his current portrayal of yet another kidnapper-bent-on-killing-the-president in the TV series &#8220;Hostages.&#8221;Director Antoine Fuqua certainly knows how to crank up the energy, but even the most diehard action film fan may have some trouble stomaching the astonishingly high body count in this one. At the very least, you might find yourself reaching for some earplugs long about the half hour mark just to find some respite from all the noise.The initial invasion scenes are admittedly very exciting, but the static hostage drama - with its tough guy bravado and seemingly endless cat-and-mouse tour of the White House - that ensues eventually becomes wearying.If you like movies in which the fate of the world rests in the hands of a single man getting to the launch codes in time - served with a heaping helping of good old-fashioned American jingoism on the side - then &#8220;Olympus Has Fallen&#8221; may be just the meal you ordered.

The film's come under a lot of criticism both for its ""anti-Asian sentiment"" (bull-crap, the bad guys here are North Korean, giving the Middle Easterners a break for once ... and let's face it, lately the North Koreans haven't been so friendly in real life either.  The other critique comes from the supposedly unbelievable plotting, starting with no less than Gerard Butler's character singlehandedly fighting an army of armed professional killers ... but to me, for films like this a suspension of belief is mandatory; you have to just set logic aside and enjoy from the gut.  This film is like 'Die Hard at the White House' and it grabs and holds you for its entire two-hour run.Gerard Butler plays Mike Banning, bodyguard to no less than the President of the United States (Aaron Eckhart) ... until a tragedy not of Banning's making gets Mike relegated to a desk job at the Treasury a year later.  But when the White House itself comes under siege by a veritable army that strikes by air, land and even from within, as the body count grows way into double digits it comes down to Banning and his inside knowledge of both the White House and President to make his way into the captured 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, making his way down to the underground bunker where the President remains captive.Films speak best to me when the plot or characters are so real that I become engaged in what's going to happen next.  With 'Olympus Has Fallen' if you're seeking deep plot or characterization then BOY are you watching the wrong film.  But once in awhile, much as you like filet mignon, a fat hamburger piled high with toppings just yells comfort food - and that's what this film did for me.  PURE propaganda, mindless action/violence, and an adrenaline-charged homage to America are what you have hear, and damnit but it's just sort of a blast to watch.  Also very involving; at times, the more they destroyed and desecrated the White House, as an American it was such a violation, I found myself fairly itching to tear into the screen and rip the faces off the bad guys for destroying such an iconic symbol of the USA.

The decent action flicks of yesterday have been replaced by superheroes shooting space aliens or super gory, gross movies that are so hardcore they turn me off before I ever get past the trailer. But this movie takes you back to the really cool action thrillers of yesteryear and frankly, I was riveted throughout.The action is non stop and the acting is superb, especially for this type of movie. I had never seen Gerard Butler in a movie before but from now on, he is on my watch list. His portrayal of Mike Banning is gritty and down to earth, never over the top. Aaron Eckhart does a very good job with the rather thankless role of the Hostage In Chief. He, too, never stoops to caricature; just a man faced with a horrifying situation. Morgan Freeman and Angela Bassett are solid and realistic as the Speaker of the House and the Director of the Secret Service. Rick Yune is a absolute chiller of a villain.Yes, the movie is bloody - but not as bad as some. The violence is brutal and dirty but crucial to the plot. Maybe some of the story is cliched but I haven't seen this type of movie for a long time. For me, it is a welcome return to the action genre. (In fact, I'm going back next week to see it again.

I don't know how many people I had to see graphically get shot, cut, stabbed, etc. which really changed the entire audience and point of the film, shifting it from what ""could have been"" a good story had the script been worked on more.  I expected more of a Harrison Ford sort of government suspense film.Sadly, this film apparently decided to use very graphic killings on screen, over and over, to try to keep the audience's interest (for me it had the opposite effect).  I barely finished it and held out for the intriguing sounding plot - the film they should have made - that elaborated on the idea of secret passageways inside the White House that only the secret agent that coincidentally knew like the back of his hand could use to his advantage - not just once, but in many clever ways, as the premise of the story.That didn't happen.  I won't even go into the plot holes (story lines completely dropped) or the ridiculous premise and what turns out to be a seemingly pointless motive after dropping one that might have made a little sense.  I felt sorry for Angela Basset (who seems to be typecast as a D.C. high ranking official in many films); her superb acting (I think she tried her best) was limited by the ridiculous plot and how much she could look upset in the ""war room.""  Morgan Freeman's character was also flattened by the dumb story (he's also a great actor) - again, with entire plot point dropped, the history between the characters and mention of some prior bad blood between the politicians didn't play into the story at all (so why bring it up in some foreshadowing way?)  Lastly, no commander in chief would ever (spoiler alert) give away countries or nuclear weapons codes to save the life of one person, even the President.Gerard Butler did kick some butt, which is why it didn't get negative stars.

The base plot it the White House is under siege and Gerald Butler must single handed save it.//SPOILERS//The most annoying part is that not a single thing that happens is realistic or plausible. First when they are driving on the bridge, yes it is icey, but they are only going 30, yet somehow, a car going 30 manages to smash through a concrete guard rail. Then, the presidents limo is hanging over the edge rocking. Rather than jumping on the trunk and sitting there for counter balance they try and hold onto the back to keep it balanced. Butler saves the president, but the first lady falls with the car. Why couldn't someone else have pulled her out the other side whilst he was pulling out the president. They had like four guys per car in this five or six car line.So then he gets fired, but ends up working for the treasury so they can keep him just down the road. So then this plane comes flying into the capital. Two fighters pull along side it and tell it that it is in restricted air space. They give it a bunch of chances to land despite it refusing to identify itself. And it magically manages to shot both of them down. I see no way a plane could get anywhere near there after 9/11. Or how a bomber could out maneuver interceptors. It shoots down like four. And has magical flares that can fool smart missiles from the planes. But that was just the distraction. Then all these Koreans who were hiding in plane clothes attack the White House while everyone is distracted. Butler is the only one who survives the Gatling gun attacks and makes it inside.Then we get to where the senior government betrays the people. They are being held hostage by the Korean diplomats who came to visit. Rather than die to save the people, they give up their codes to detonate all the us nuclear missiles. But, they only get two. And despite the fact that it would take the best password cracker(that 25 gpu one) over a week to crack one of those passwords, they crack the third in less than an hour. So much for three tries on a password.Then, Butler manages to kill all the bad guys and stop they system by himself, big surprise!Finally, there is the fact that when you see the map of nuclear weapons in the US, there is like one dot for Montana.It feels like they made this movie entirely to make people angry against the Koreans.

On the other hand, it can also be said that Olympus Has Fallen succeeds where the original Die Hard also succeeded. However one wants to look at it, if you like any form of Die Hard, you are sure to like Olympus Has Fallen.While the title may lead one to suspect that this is an epic Greek battle of the gods, this ""Olympus"" refers to the ""most heavily secured building in the world,"" the White House. Yet within thirteen minutes, a grisly surprise attack by North Korea causes this ""Olympus"" to fall and fall hard! Disgraced presidential security operative, Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) finds himself in serious John McClane territory as he becomes the only eyes and ears that Speaker of the House and acting president Allan Trumbull (Morgan Freeman) has on a hostage situation that includes President Asher (Aaron Eckart), Secretary of Defence McMillan (Melissa Leo), Vice President Rodriguez, and South Korean Prime Minister Lee (Keong Sim).Butler plays this role well. He's tough but also sympathetic. Director Antoine Fuqua keeps the action fresh, moving, and increasingly relentless. He also keeps it dark, and not just figuratively. Much of the film takes place in a darkened White House at night, which results in some confusing and disorienting action scenes from time to time. Butler's main objective is to infiltrate the presidential bunker where North Korean terrorist Kang (Rick Yune) menacingly tortures and executes hostages until his demands for the US to withdraw all resistive forces from Korean territory are met. Kang is an excellent villain and Yune plays his part to a cold and ominous effect.Olympus's greatest advantage is its pacing and relentless action. There is little character development, barring a short prologue at the beginning that reveals the rift between President Asher and Banning; thus, the characters are hardly memorable. Instead, it is shooting, killing, stabbing, kicking, and punching and lots of it. The film isn't lazy about its action though, and it is for this reason that it is successful in rising above average action fare. It is doubtful, we will see Olympus Falls Again, but for a one and done ""kicking ass and taking names"" kind of movie, this one feels like Die Hard on a ""Good Day.""

Now on to the review proper.]Did I really not like this film?  I can't quite say that, and I can't quite say that it's okay either.  This film was almost painfully routine, like the screenwriter was a first timer who based his script on all of the action-adventure movies that he watched and loved as a kid only to see how many of the stale plot devices he could try to warm up (oh, look, I'm doing it too by being sexist and ascribing the script to being written by a man; let me try that again...).This film was almost painfully routine, like the screenwriter was a first timer who based her script on all of the action-adventure movies that she watched and loved as a kid only to see how many of the stale plot devices she could try to warm up.  [Did you see what I did there?  Yeah?  Well, if you thought that was great then maybe you'll get a blast out of this movie and find it highly original versus derivative.  If you didn't like what I did then you probably get the point that I'm making about this film being hackneyed, only what I did here was more original than what you'll be watching in this film.]Here I'm going on about this being a derivative movie.  Most movies are derivative but we don't care as long as they feel fresh or package the plot in an exciting way.  OHF fails on these accounts as well, though at least it's not totally boring as far as action movies go.  If you're a fan of seeing the plot unfold well before it unfolds, lots of fake CGI blood spatter, and explosions you still might like this movie.

Starring Gerard Butler/Aaron Eckhart/Morgan Freeman/Angela Bassett/Rick Yune. Music by Trevor Morris. Released by Film DistrictStoryline: US President Benjamin Asher (Aaron Eckhart), is captured by a Korean terrorist group, in vengeance of USA&#8217;s deployment of its armed forces in the Korean seas. The group leader Kang&#8217;s (Rick Yune), an orphan due to US military actions in South Korea, organizes his forces to take control of the White House and its defense systems to force US to withdraw its forces from Korean seas and also activate &#8216;Cerebrus&#8217;, a US army nuclear missile self detonating software, in order to turn the entire land of USA into a mere radioactive wasteland forever.Kang&#8217;s plot is rendered void through the brave efforts of Mike Banning (Gerard Butler), a US secret service agent and former Army Ranger. He cleverly enters the White House and eliminates all of Kang&#8217;s group members and saves the President from sure death. He also successfully deactivates the self detonating timer, in the last second, only to save the entire nation from a permanent catastrophe.Positives: An action packed movie where we get to see the latest weapons of the world in full action. The audience will be awe-struck by the sheer military power of USA and the brains behind to control the same. The great pleasure one gets in seeing the White House destroyed by some foreign terrorists, through, computer aided graphical representation of the building and its surroundings, in note worthy. One must watch this film to gauge the potential of computerized presentation of such massive structures like White House on big screen. It&#8217;s really awesome to watch how one gets to feel as if the White House is really destroyed.Negatives: Is the most protected building of the world so vulnerable to a terrorist attack, despite the latest technology available to detect surface-borne threats?

1628374,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B00BEIYHO2,Todd Smith,"[2, 2]","Olympus Has Fallen is the latest big budget action film from revolutionary Director, Antoine Fuqua. The film has a ton of stars and some great effects, but unfortunately it is very similar to a popular action classic. All is well in Washington, as the President prepares to meet with a delegation from South Korea. All of a sudden the capital is attacked and the White House is taken with some very important people still inside. The task of getting them out alive falls to one man, Secret Service Agent, Mike Banning (Gerard Butler). If you took the cast of the original Die Hard and had them re-shoot the movie, scene by scene, at the White House, you'd have Olympus Has Fallen. Normally I find Fuqua's take on the action genre, refreshing and original, but you wouldn't know it by watching this film. It is freaky how similar this film was to Die Hard, they even have some of the same twist, goals, types of terrorist, all that's missing is a short fat cop and a hand radio. Don't get me wrong, I did find the movie entertaining and Gerard Butler has really stepped up and taken the reigns as the lead you want in your action film. The effects are terrific and unlike Die Hard, this film has a ton of big named stars in it, that really do give the film some teeth. Olympus Has Fallen was a great idea, with a ton of stars, and the right Director. The film made a ton of money and gave us action junkies the edge of your seat entertainment we crave.

While the plot and idea seem exciting the movie felt flat and even a little boring in parts. There was no real character development and it was hard to care about the hostages or even Banning doing what he was doing. The main problem I had with this is that it felt like a remake of Die Hard, without the wit or excitement. I could have just been my expectations but I was very disappointed in this movie. Overall, not nearly as good as I was expecting. I give it a B-.",3,"A movie that I had high expectations for. Turned out to be flat, little boring & I didn't care about characters.

Directed by Antoine Fuqua of ""Training Day"" fame, ""Olympus Has Fallen"" remains tense and absorbing for the most part, though some of the special effects leave much to be desired.This is from Millennium Films, a studio behind action films like ""The Expendables."" They know how to make entertaining action movies without spending too much money on effects, and that one of the keys for success is the cast.

It is pretty rare if this type movie alters the game plan. So, the big question is...how well does the movie deliver til the end and this movie does a pretty good job.&#9830; Acting: Well done from all involved. A lot of top rated actors are in this movie. Biggest positive surprise was Melissia Leo who plays the Secetary of Defense, Ruth McMillan. She does an excellect job. Biggest negative surprise was Aaron Eckhard. Although I am an Eckhart fan, I don't think he had enough to do in this movie and overacted his part. Gerard Butler pretty much has the same role in most of his movies.....kick butt and swoon the ladies.&#9830; Writing: They didn't waste a lot of time/money on scripts. However, I didn't expect great writing. I expected to see Butler beat up some bad guys and save the world all by himself. He does.&#9830; Family friendly: This movie is intense. Lots of fighting, gun fights, stabbings, beatings, etc. A few of the gun shot deaths were fairly graphic. The ""F"" word is used a lot along with a few other cuss words. With that being said, this movie is a lot less offensive than many others I have seen. Nothing sexually explicit. Just fighting and cussing.&#9830; Computer generated imagery: Appropriate for a movie of this calibur. Some of the gunfire special effects were pretty neat.

Olympus Has Fallen will do the trick.  It's pretty outrageous in just about everything and pushes the boundaries of our credibility to the max, but still, it WILL entertain.  There is much to like here, and I even warmed to Butler as the hero after a time. Yes, there is WAY too much wave-the-flag, rah-rah America pandering here, and way too much paranoia exploited during these very real dark days of terrorism, but this is, at root, merely a kind of Die Hard in the White House movie, without the more compelling sass of Bruce Willis leading the charge.  The entire movie revolves around terrorists taking over the White House and the disgraced CIA dude secreted away in the innards of the White House trying to thwart their evil plot.  Will he succeed?  Of course he will.  We all know that within the first 5 minutes of so of the movie.  In action flicks like this, it's always about the 'how' and never about the 'if'.  And most of us know--more or less- even about the 'how' part of the equation; we are merely there to watch it again, just like we've done in other films of this sort that we've already seen dozens of times.Still, there are some scenes within Olympus that are somewhat rattling to see.  I won't tell you what they are other than to say they are icons of American society. I will watch Olympus again some day; perhaps soon.  It was worth an hour or so of my time in spite of it's simplistic paranoiac approach.
