Although not one of the show's best, it was often quite funny and sometimes a little forbidding and eerie; but obviously, it is more designed to frighten little ones. This episode was alot of the time designed to be more humorous than scary and for the most part, it succeeds in being a nice little two-part episode.

It has four episodes from the 90s TV Series that is based on the books by R.L. Stine! The series was filmed in Canada on a low-budget! Some of the adaptions got an hour episode, a two-part episode, or a single episode. Because of the short running time, the majority of the plot had to be cut.Here we get the two-part episode titled One Day At Horrorland. While on their way to the Zoo Gardens, the Morris family decides to stop at the Horrorland amusement park. At first the place seems like fun, but then the horror begins.Welcome to Camp Nightmare is another two-part episode, where Billy is sent to a crappy summer camp, but then the campers start to disappear. Determined not to be next vanishing camper, Billy tries to find out what is going on.Like I said, these episodes have a low-budget, which explains the bad special effects and acting. Goosebumps is a clean-cut way to introduce scary tales to your kids and the DVD can be fun to watch around Halloween.",4,One Day At Horrorland,1345939200,"08 26, 2012",2012,1059,"['guess', 'people', ""n't"", 'understand', 'Goosebumps', 'One', 'Day', 'Horrorland', 'not', 'movie', 'four', 'episodes', '90s', 'TV', 'Series', 'based', 'books', 'R.L', 'Stine', 'series', 'was', 'filmed', 'Canada', 'low-budget', 'adaptions', 'got', 'hour', 'episode', 'two-part', 'episode', 'single', 'episode', 'short', 'running', 'time', 'majority', 'plot', 'had', 'be', 'cut.Here', 'get', 'two-part', 'episode', 'titled', 'One', 'Day', 'Horrorland', 'way', 'Zoo', 'Gardens', 'Morris', 'family', 'stop', 'Horrorland', 'amusement', 'park', 'first', 'place', 'fun', 'then', 'horror', 'begins.Welcome', 'Camp', 'Nightmare', 'two-part', 'episode', 'where', 'Billy', 'sent', 'crappy', 'summer', 'camp', 'then', 'campers', 'start', 'disappear', 'Determined', 'not', 'be', 'next', 'vanishing', 'camper', 'Billy', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'said', 'episodes', 'have', 'low-budget', 'bad', 'special', 'effects', 'acting', 'Goosebumps', 'clean-cut', 'way', 'introduce', 'scary', 'tales', 'kids', 'DVD', 'can', 'be', 'fun', 'watch', 'around', 'Halloween']",Goosebumps - One Day at Horrorland Part 1 & 2 VHS

Unfortunately, it wasn't as scary as some of the other Goosebumps offerings.  The first episode, ""One Day at Horrorland"", was not really scary at all.  The story revolves around a family who's going to the zoo for vacation.  On their way, they get lost and end up at an amusement park called Horrorland.  The park is operated by various monsters and ghouls.  The children convince their parents to let them go off by themselves and ride some of the rides.  But, after a while, the whole family is herded up and put in some bizarre game show.  Needless to say, it wasn't very scary.The second episode is called ""Welcome to Camp Nightmare"".  Billy is going to camp for the first time.  The camp is run by some very strange counselors.  Soon, several of Billy's fellow campers have disappeared under mysterious circumstances.  Billy is determined to find out what is really going on, but the ending is somewhat of a letdown.  This episode is more scary than the first one, though.Overall, I would rate this DVD as only average.  Some parts are scary, but for the most part, it is pretty boring.

While heading there, they are suddenly confronted with a fireball shooting billboard inviting them to visit Horrorland. After the long day of driving, they decide to stop there while the kids ride a few rides and the parents get directions to Zoo Gardens. Upon their arrival they are informed that they are ""guests"" for the day and can enter the park for free. Initially, things appear inviting, but both the kids, as they ride the rides, and the parents, as they search for someone to get directions from, realize that there's something about the park that's just not right. But once you visit Horrorland, you don't leave.""Welcome to Camp Nightmare""- at the beginning of the first episode, Billy and the rest of the Camp Nightmoon campers are dropped off in the middle of the road in the middle of nowhere by their bus driver. He doesn't say a word as he drops them off and drives away. But there's something in the woods and it comes after the children until they are rescued by Uncle Al, the director of the boy's division of Camp Nightmoon. He leads the kids to camp and at a path in the forest sends the girls to their own camp. The fun and excitement of being at camp quickly fades as the boys realize that Camp Nightmoon isn't quite right. There's no nurse and no phones. A boy is bitten by a snake and the next morning he's gone. Soon other campers start disappearing one by one and Billy comes to believe that Camp Nightmoon is just one long nightmare.GOOSEBUMPS: ONE DAY AT HORROLAND is a typical ""Goosebumps"" collection. It's a little different than some of the other Goosebumps DVDs as it contains two, two-part episodes. The effects are little cheesy, e.g. at one point in ""One Day at Horroland"" you can see the real mouth of actors of one of the monsters sticking out of the mask mouth on his face. These episodes don't have as much humor as some of the other stories, but they do follow the basic storylines of the books they are based upon rather closely.
