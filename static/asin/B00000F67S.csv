For sure there's moments of askewed humor but there's also a resounding poignancy to the film.  The narrative's structure is unlike any I've seen before.  One has to watch carefully to appreciate the rewards this film offers.  Essentially the story revolves around the relationship between two Army operators, Eustace Clay(Steve McQueen) and Maxwell Slaughter(Jackie Gleason).  This is not so much a fraternal relationship but a paternal one.  Clay, full of spit and vinegar, emulates the more subdued Slaughter.  Slaughter, a melancholic Army lifer, admires the high-spirited Clay.  There's a certain buoyancy to McQueen's performance that I haven't seen in his other work.  It's a daring turn that makes you see McQueen in a different light.  Gleason has played restrained before, as demonstrated in ""The Hustler"", and there's something touching about his work here.

A Jackie Gleason-Steve McQueen pairing? It may seem odd but in the end it works and SOLDIER IN THE RAIN is a surpisingly warm and heartfelt comedy-drama.Supply Sgt. Eustis Clay is played by a very different Steve McQueen. The cool McQueen is there as is a sort of awkward McQueen. McQueen plays Clay with an odd accent and for a while it's hard to determine if Clay is just an poorly educated country boy or if there is something deeper going on. Clay idolizes his superior Sgt. Maxwell Slaughter played by the ever unique Jackie Gleason. Clay will do anything to make Slaughter happy and here is the basis of an odd relationship.What a cast to praise. A lovely young Tuesday Weld is Bobby Jo Pepperdine. Tony Bill has a great quirky role as one of Clay's pals. Add in a young Tom Poston and we have a great cast. Blake Edwards was at the beginning of his career and cowrote this play.Stay with the movie to appreciate its beauty. It has a slow and silly start. Eustis Clay is an awkward soldier and probably not anyone's first choice for defending the nation yet he has a subtle charm. The subtle beauty of this film is the obvious never takes place. Tuesday Weld's Bobby Jo gets set up with Sgt, Slaughter rather than the more appropriate in age Sgt. Clay. It's an awkward relationship as Bobby Jo uses unkind size-related remarks towards Slaughter but Slaughter begins to shine as the one decent and caring older man Bobby Jo has meant. They both begin go respect each other. A beautiful story develops.Unfortunately, as things begin to fall into place and we want to see relationships develop further, the movie ends. SOLDIER IN THE RAIN is one of McQueen's forgotten gems but it should not be overlooked. It's too bad the film has not be widely released on DVD by the studio and is only a DVD on demand from Amazon.

499269,A1GHO6BR5J0NHX,B00000F67S,Richard Masloski,"[8, 8]","SOLDIER IN THE RAIN is a relatively little-known film that has been quite overshadowed by Steve McQueen's  King of Cool classics.  Yet...it is one of his absolute best! His performance is unlike any he ever played before or after - and it is totally believable and unique. Jackie Gleason - brilliant in his dramatic turns in THE HUSTLER and REQUIEM FOR A HEAVYWEIGHT - outdoes himself in the role he plays in this film.  Tuesday Weld is a somewhat neglected actress - yet in this movie her character is sexy and stupid yet profoundly poetic at times - and you believe every second of her performance.  Ed Nelson has a tarnished shine as a cruel and corrupt MP.  Tony Bill plays an annoying goofball - and he does this remarkably well.  Along the way there is Tom Poston standing in sauerkraut juice to ged rid of his semi-corns and a start-of-his career Adam West.  The Henry Mancini music score is flawless.  Direction, cinematography, pacing, dialog - all top-shelf.  And there is one of the best bar-fights ever put on film to boot!Many people get confused by the comedy/drama genre.  They expect a film to be one or the other.  Yet...life itself is a dichotomy.  It is dual by nature.  Laughter and tears carry us from cradle to grave, so why shouldn't a movie reflect this larger embrace of Life and all of its nuances?As with other releases under the banner of the Warner Brothers Archives, there are no chapter stops, no menu, no commentaries, nothing...except for the film.  Yet for a reason I do not know, there is a brief scene deleted from this print.  It is a cafeteria confrontation between the protagonists and the antagonists.  Also, when I was in my teens and would catch this film on TV the main credits were accompanied by the main theme played by trumpet with orchestral backup.  The main theme is amongst Mancini's finest.  I think it is even better than ""Moon River"" and ""Days of Wine and Roses.""  The trouble is, when I would see it at other times on TV, the credit sequence would sometimes be accompanied by a carefree, Pink Panther-like tune that readied the viewer more for a whimsical comedy than the fuller spectrum of Life that the film actually conveys.  Sadly, the hauntingly beautiful theme is not used on this DVD for the credit sequence.  The back of the DVD also boldly states ""Forward March to Comedy for Jackie Gleason and Steve McQueen!""  This blurb makes me wonder if the blurb-writer even saw the movie.  Yes, there are funny moments throughout - but this is not a Jerry Lewis movie.If you have not seen the movie and want to, it is best to enter the story as one enters the world each day: not knowing what to expect.  In my opinion, it should be this way with ALL movies and books.SPOILER ALERT: However, for those who have seen SOLDIER IN THE RAIN, this film contains a wordless sequence between McQueen and a Pepsi machine that sums up the impact of death upon those left behind in a way that speaks volumes without the utterance of a single word. It is one of McQueen's finest, albeit brief, moments as an actor. It never fails to bring tears to my eyes.  And yes - if you have a heart and soul - tears will definitely flow. I daresay, the sequence to which I refer is arguably the BEST encapsulation ever put on film of what it means to lose someone you truly love - and miss.  Get out the Kleenex box!This is a movie that should definitely not be missed by anyone who truly loves film.
