The film deals with their struggles to adjust to life outside an institution and follows their progress toward becoming functional. It is more a film about friendship than about mental illness and it makes you feel good about being human. The ending is fantastic! Don't let the fact that it has subtitles put you off.

But the 2001 Oscar went toNo Man's Landfrom Bosnia and Herzevogina.  The casting for Elling, along with the acting and concept are brilliant.  It is rare when so many oddball moments are packed into one film, but this sure has its fill.  The pace moves along well.Th premise of this entertaining and very humorous film is for two quirky roommates are released from an institution to now forge for themselves with help of government funding.  Elling (Per Christian Ellefsen)  is a 40ish anxiety filled mama's boy.  He clearly lived under his mother's thumb, never doing anything on his own.  Then, she dies and he is sent away to the institution where he meets Kjell Bjarne (Sven Nordin) who is sex-obsessed and rather a simpleton of a big guy.It is from here with the help of social worker Frank Asli to guide and teach them a few things on life outside the institution.  Elling is fearful of stepping into the world including using a phone.  Kjell has experience with a phone sex business.  The film is filled with so many escapades, it comprises of so many emotional moments, mainly being very funny.  What we learn as the film goes along is that the men clearly have talent in their own right.I have to reveal a most funny segment is when Kjell intends to have sex with the pregnant girl, but his state of cleanliness poses him to question.  Kjell asks Elling if he could borrow his underwear.  The underwear is removed, exchanges hands and Sven washes up in the lake and all is well!

Good movies can come from anywhere and this Norwegian export is example A-1.  It surely deserved its 2002 Academy Award nomination for Best Foreign Language Film.Co-leads Per Christian Ellefsen (as the title character) and Sven Nordin (as Kjell Bjarne) are long-time veterans of Oslo's New Theatre.  To discover that these two are long-time friends and collaborators (a 20-year relationship at the time of the film) is not a surprise: their interactions on the screen are so life-like - filled with spontaneity, mood changes and subtle shifts that make up real relationships.  Ostensibly playing 'simple' characters, their talents manifest themselves in the way they slowly reveal the depth and hidden reserves of Elling and Kjell Bjarne.The movie also benefits from the regal presence of Per Christensen, portraying writer Alfons Jrgensen.  Elling stumbles into a friendship with him.  Ellefsen's portrayal of frenzied excitement at making his 'first real friend' is one of the movie's best moments, as is his initial fit of pique when Kjell Bjarne forms his own bonds with Jrgensen.  That Elling connects over poetry and Kjell Bjarne over old American cars and a chance to rehab Jrgensen's 50s-era Buick speaks to the subtle nature of a winning script and understated direction by Petter Nss.",5,This Norwegian comedy surely deserved its 2002 nomination for Best Foreign Language Film,1295654400,"01 22, 2011",2011,1501,"['brilliant', 'feel-good', 'movie', 'reminded', 'delight', 'surprise', 'sprung', 'byEverybody', 'Famous', 'walked', 'away', 'telling', 'people', 'wow', 'one', 'best', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Flemish', 'Good', 'movies', 'can', 'come', 'anywhere', 'Norwegian', 'export', 'example', 'A-1', 'surely', 'deserved', '2002', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Language', 'Film.Co-leads', 'Per', 'Christian', 'Ellefsen', 'title', 'character', 'Sven', 'Nordin', 'Kjell', 'Bjarne', 'are', 'long-time', 'veterans', 'Oslo', 'New', 'Theatre', 'discover', 'two', 'are', 'long-time', 'friends', 'collaborators', '20-year', 'relationship', 'time', 'film', 'not', 'surprise', 'interactions', 'screen', 'are', 'so', 'life-like', 'filled', 'spontaneity', 'mood', 'changes', 'subtle', 'shifts', 'make', 'up', 'real', 'relationships', 'Ostensibly', 'playing', ""'simple"", 'characters', 'talents', 'manifest', 'way', 'slowly', 'reveal', 'depth', 'hidden', 'reserves', 'Elling', 'Kjell', 'Bjarne.The', 'movie', 'also', 'benefits', 'regal', 'presence', 'Per', 'Christensen', 'portraying', 'writer', 'Alfons', 'Jrgensen', 'Elling', 'stumbles', 'friendship', 'Ellefsen', 'portrayal', 'frenzied', 'excitement', 'making', ""'first"", 'real', 'friend', 'one', 'movie', 'best', 'moments', 'initial', 'fit', 'pique', 'when', 'Kjell', 'Bjarne', 'own', 'bonds', 'Jrgensen', 'Elling', 'connects', 'poetry', 'Kjell', 'Bjarne', 'old', 'American', 'cars', 'chance', 'rehab', 'Jrgensen', '50s-era', 'Buick', 'speaks', 'subtle', 'nature', 'winning', 'script', 'understated', 'direction', 'Petter', 'Nss']",Elling

When they are released and housed together in a welfare apartment (A very NICE welfare apartment!) both men continue to share a bedroom because they have never been left alone.  They spend their time together talking about how to conquer the outside world.At first the audience worries about Elling, the older man, the ""Mama's Boy"" because his life prior to being institutionalized was all about his mother.  He didn't dare venture outside; he was quite content spending his time in his apartment and reading his books.His roommate, a Prince Valliant sort of younger man who seems to have an aversion to showering and keeping clean, has his own issues to deal with.  He ventures outside but in the persuit of food.  He does very little talking.So as these two slowly make it outside, we are left wondering who of the two will be the first to make it big, and the surprise is quite ironic.  By meeting others around them, these two men realize that they aren't really all that crazy afterall.  Everyone around them has issues.The scenery of the Norwegian countryside, the city shots of Oslo and the overall quick dialogue of these two odd balls make for a wonderful 90 minutes of vicarious travel to a country I've never been.

I've watched it three times and been very entertained by it. One warning for those inspired to check this out: the first half hour can be a bit boring, but stick with it and you'll be rewarded with a very funny, charming film.The story centers around two guys who are released out of a state mental hospital and given an apartment to live in (with a probation-type officer keeping tabs on how they're adjusting.) At first, it's tough as they guys are kind of clueless on how to do things on their own, particularly ""mama's boy"" Elling who is even afraid to use a telephone. His roommate is a big oaf whose main concern in life is to have sex with a woman.In time, these guys learn nicely how to adjust. Even better, they make a friend or two and help those people with their problems. That's where the charm of the film comes in. Most of the humor is provided by ""Elling,"" who narrates the film with some wonderful dry humor. At first, his whining gets annoying but after he calms down in his new surroundings, he's fun. His roommate winds up as a straight man for his jokes. The roommate, ""Kjell Bjarne,"" is a big help to everyone including a pregnant, abandoned lady. He's an oaf, but one with a big heart.This is really different and nice story. It's not for kids with a dozen or so s and f- words, but kids wouldn't like this film anyway.

Told from the perspective of the persnickety, hypercritical, poetic Elling, everyday situations, pleasures and annoyances are elevated to supremely entertaining vignettes about things most people take for granted. The simple act of answering the telephone or leaving the house leaves Elling and his giant oaf-like virgin roommate Kjell Bjarne terrified.

719914,A367Q9VRWQZG7W,B00006L92B,Gavin B.,"[40, 40]","""Elling"" is the first film I've ever seen that transcends the popular film industry stereotypes and portrays people with mental illness as fully functioning three dimensional people, with both emotional and intellectual motivations as characters in a film. The prevailing ""Hollywood"" characterizations of mental illness seems to use three templates to portray mentally ill characters: 1) the over-the-top violent sociopath who is a dangerous predatory beast i.e...Hannibal the Cannibal; 2) the unstable visionary savant who can hardly function but is either intellectually brilliant or has or possesses some sort of supernatural power to compensate i.e...Russell Crowe in ""Beautiful Mind"" or Dustin Hoffman in ""Rainman"". or, 3) the loveable, laughable, whacky lunatic who can't fit into society and is a walking time-bomb  i.e...Jack Nicholson in ""Cuckoo's Nest.""This adaptation of Norwegian writer Ingvar Ambjorsen's best selling novel is a nuanced view of the lives of two mentally ill wards of the state as they struggle to adapt to living as roommates; and they try to make sense of often puzzling and arbitrary codes of  ""normal"" social behavior. At times it is hilarious, but just as Director Peter Naess lures you into a warm and fuzzy feeling, he gives you a glimpse at the simmering rage of his main characters Elling and Kjell. Having worked as a case worker for transitional mental health patients, I can say that ""Elling"" is the only film I've ever seen that ""gets it right"" and doesn't approach the subject of mental illness in a condescending or derivative manner. Elling and Kjell aren't lovable loonies or dangerous whackos from central casting.  There is a great deal of humor in ""Elling"" but none of it is used to demean or stereotype the principal characters.  When a young punk poet, in bondage gear and Kiss whiteface screams his menacing poetry at a coffee house, it causes an anxiety attack for Elling...but it also begs the question, ""Who's the crazy one, here?.""The brilliance of  ""Elling"",however is the two actors who play Elling and Kjell. Per Christian Ellefsen (as Elling) is a fascinating and gentle soul in a constant struggle to keep his obsessions, agoraphobia and anti-social tendencies from consuming him. His sense of equilibrium is threatened by a trip to the grocery store or even picking up the phone and talking.  On the other hand, Sven Nordin (as Kjell) is a hulking and affable man (think Gerard Depardieu) who is prone to wild mood swings that lead to socially inappropriate behavior. Kjell's innocence leads him to unwittingly make remarks to women which are regarded as inappropriate in polite society. Kjell is more than capable of a loving , caring sexual relationship but doesn't have the social skills to establish rapport with a female.As the film progress the two roommates are slowly transformed into fully functional people, albeit, people who still have a lot of problems, but now have the tools to adapt to the perplexing world of social norms.  Elling's friendship with elderly bohemian intellectual who shares his passion for poetry provides him with self confidence in his own tentative attempt to write poetry.  Kjell's friendship as an informal caretaker for an upstairs neighbor develops into a romantic relationship, as the her pregnancy from a prior lover progresses. Kjell realizes he loves the woman and will help her care for the child as if the child was his own flesh and blood.  Both Elling and Kjell anchor each other's erratic behaviors in ways that the viewer never anticipates, and they are often stunned by thier own abilty to say the right thing at the right time, to keep their roommate from spinning out of control. It's a inspiring form of peer therapy.It is the intriguing and often quirky relationship between our two roommates, Elling and Kjell, that brings the magic to this film. Per Christian and Sven played the principal roles in the stage play of ""Elling""; so if you sense that they bring a sense familiar comfort to their acting chemistry, it's because they've shared the stage for hundreds  of performances as Elling and Kjell. This movie production of Elling was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 2001, and is shot entirely in Oslo Norway which is a captivating and under used European film location.",5,"""Elling""  Transcends the Stereotypes",1085270400,"05 23, 2004",2004,4323,"['Elling', 'first', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'popular', 'film', 'industry', 'stereotypes', 'portrays', 'people', 'mental', 'illness', 'fully', 'functioning', 'three', 'dimensional', 'people', 'emotional', 'intellectual', 'motivations', 'characters', 'film', 'prevailing', 'Hollywood', 'characterizations', 'mental', 'illness', 'use', 'three', 'templates', 'portray', 'mentally', 'ill', 'characters', '1', 'over-the-top', 'violent', 'sociopath', 'who', 'dangerous', 'predatory', 'beast', 'i.e', 'Cannibal', '2', 'unstable', 'visionary', 'savant', 'who', 'can', 'hardly', 'function', 'intellectually', 'brilliant', 'sort', 'supernatural', 'power', 'compensate', 'i.e', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Rainman', '3', 'loveable', 'laughable', 'whacky', 'lunatic', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fit', 'society', 'walking', 'time-bomb', 'i.e', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'adaptation', 'Norwegian', 'writer', 'Ingvar', 'Ambjorsen', 'best', 'selling', 'novel', 'nuanced', 'view', 'lives', 'two', 'mentally', 'ill', 'wards', 'state', 'struggle', 'adapt', 'living', 'roommates', 'try', 'make', 'sense', 'often', 'puzzling', 'arbitrary', 'codes', 'normal', 'social', 'behavior', 'times', 'hilarious', 'just', 'Director', 'Peter', 'Naess', 'warm', 'fuzzy', 'feeling', 'glimpse', 'simmering', 'rage', 'main', 'characters', 'Elling', 'Kjell', 'Having', 'worked', 'case', 'worker', 'transitional', 'mental', 'health', 'patients', 'can', 'say', 'Elling', 'only', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'right', ""n't"", 'approach', 'subject', 'mental', 'illness', 'condescending', 'derivative', 'manner', 'Elling', 'Kjell', 'are', ""n't"", 'lovable', 'loonies', 'dangerous', 'whackos', 'central', 'casting', 'great', 'deal', 'humor', 'Elling', 'none', 'used', 'demean', 'stereotype', 'principal', 'characters', 'When', 'young', 'punk', 'poet', 'bondage', 'gear', 'Kiss', 'whiteface', 'screams', 'menacing', 'poetry', 'coffee', 'house', 'anxiety', 'attack', 'Elling', 'also', 'question', 'Who', 'crazy', 'one', 'here', 'brilliance', 'Elling', 'however', 'two', 'actors', 'who', 'play', 'Elling', 'Kjell', 'Per', 'Christian', 'Ellefsen', 'Elling', 'fascinating', 'gentle', 'soul', 'constant', 'struggle', 'keep', 'obsessions', 'agoraphobia', 'anti-social', 'tendencies', 'consuming', 'sense', 'equilibrium', 'threatened', 'trip', 'grocery', 'store', 'even', 'picking', 'up', 'phone', 'talking', 'other', 'hand', 'Sven', 'Nordin', 'Kjell', 'hulking', 'affable', 'man', 'think', 'Gerard', 'Depardieu', 'who', 'prone', 'wild', 'mood', 'swings', 'lead', 'socially', 'inappropriate', 'behavior', 'Kjell', 'innocence', 'unwittingly', 'make', 'remarks', 'women', 'are', 'regarded', 'inappropriate', 'polite', 'society', 'Kjell', 'more', 'capable', 'loving', 'caring', 'sexual', 'relationship', ""n't"", 'have', 'social', 'skills', 'establish', 'rapport', 'female.As', 'film', 'two', 'roommates', 'are', 'slowly', 'transformed', 'fully', 'functional', 'people', 'people', 'who', 'still', 'have', 'lot', 'problems', 'now', 'have', 'tools', 'adapt', 'perplexing', 'world', 'social', 'norms', 'Elling', 'friendship', 'elderly', 'bohemian', 'intellectual', 'who', 'shares', 'passion', 'poetry', 'self', 'confidence', 'own', 'tentative', 'attempt', 'write', 'poetry', 'Kjell', 'friendship', 'informal', 'caretaker', 'upstairs', 'neighbor', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'pregnancy', 'prior', 'lover', 'progresses', 'Kjell', 'woman', 'will', 'help', 'care', 'child', 'child', 'was', 'own', 'flesh', 'blood', 'Elling', 'Kjell', 'anchor', 'other', 'erratic', 'behaviors', 'ways', 'viewer', 'never', 'are', 'often', 'stunned', 'thier', 'own', 'abilty', 'say', 'right', 'thing', 'right', 'time', 'keep', 'roommate', 'spinning', 'control', 'inspiring', 'form', 'peer', 'therapy.It', 'intriguing', 'often', 'quirky', 'relationship', 'two', 'roommates', 'Elling', 'Kjell', 'magic', 'film', 'Per', 'Christian', 'Sven', 'played', 'principal', 'roles', 'stage', 'play', 'Elling', 'so', 'sense', 'bring', 'sense', 'familiar', 'comfort', 'acting', 'chemistry', ""'ve"", 'shared', 'stage', 'hundreds', 'performances', 'Elling', 'Kjell', 'movie', 'production', 'Elling', 'was', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Language', 'Film', '2001', 'shot', 'entirely', 'Oslo', 'Norway', 'captivating', 'used', 'European', 'film', 'location']",Elling

719921,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B00006L92B,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[1, 1]","Elling is an outstanding motion picture that showcases mentally ill persons as human beings with so much more to them than just their emotional problems. We get excellent portrayals of two mentally ill people thanks to a script and great acting that develop these characters with clarity, compassion and realism. The film doesn't pull any punches about mental illness; but it doesn't show that people have to be confined to their chains, either--and that's grand. The cinematography and the choreography work very well; and the acting is extremely convincing. The plot moves along at an excellent pace; I was never once bored.When the action starts, we quickly meet two men undergoing rehab in a mental institution: Elling (Per Christian Ellefsen) and Kjell Bjarne (Sven Nordin). They share a room at the rehab center and they get along so well that when they are released the state decides to get them supervised housing as roommates once again. Of course, going out into the real world, even with the help of their new social worker Frank (Jrgen Langhelle) scares them; but we see that they are willing to at least give it a try.At first giving it a try is a tough uphill battle in and of itself even though in their hearts they want to succeed. Going to the supermarket and answering the telephone create a huge amount of stress, especially for the shy and sensitive Elling. Kjell has his own emotional baggage; in particular he's obsessed with finding a girlfriend because he's never been alone with a woman. Kjell is remarkably shy around women; he never knows what to say.Things gradually begin to change. Elling gradually confronts his fears about going out of their apartment, especially after his first attempts fail and social worker Frank begins to threaten to kick them out of the apartment and send them both back to the hospital if they don't confront their fears. Elling eventually goes to a poetry meeting and decides to become an emerging mysterious poet; and Kjell falls in love with a pregnant woman who lives in their apartment building. The woman, Reidun Nordsletten (Marit Pia Jacobsen), begins to fall for Kjell, too; and she invites him over for dinner.Of course, the plot can go anywhere from here. As time goes by, Elling makes a new friend named Alfons Jrgensen (Per Christensen). Alfons helps Elling come out of his shell and encourages Elling to write more poetry after reading some of Elling's work. Meanwhile, Kjell drifts in his own direction as he becomes increasingly involved with Reidun. This could threaten the friendship between Elling and Kjell; how will they handle that? How might Reidun react if she finds out that Kjell is recently released from an institution--will she dump him or not? And what about Elling and his poetry work--will Elling turn his back on Kjell and focus on his new profession? Watch and find out!The DVD would have been a bit nicer if there had been a bonus featurette; all we get is ""scene selection"" and three trailers for other films. However, the film is so well done this actually becomes a minor complaint.Elling will move you and even educate some people about what the mentally ill can accomplish despite their problems. I highly recommend this film for fans of the actors in this movie; people interested in human dramas and psychology would do well to get this film on DVD.",5,an engaging film dealing with serious issues in a classy and even humorous way,1240617600,"04 25, 2009",2009,3348,"['Elling', 'outstanding', 'motion', 'picture', 'mentally', 'ill', 'persons', 'human', 'beings', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'just', 'emotional', 'problems', 'get', 'excellent', 'portrayals', 'two', 'mentally', 'ill', 'people', 'thanks', 'script', 'great', 'acting', 'characters', 'clarity', 'compassion', 'realism', 'film', ""n't"", 'pull', 'punches', 'mental', 'illness', ""n't"", 'show', 'people', 'have', 'be', 'confined', 'chains', 'grand', 'cinematography', 'choreography', 'work', 'very', 'well', 'acting', 'extremely', 'convincing', 'plot', 'along', 'excellent', 'pace', 'was', 'never', 'once', 'action', 'quickly', 'meet', 'two', 'men', 'undergoing', 'rehab', 'mental', 'institution', 'Elling', 'Per', 'Christian', 'Ellefsen', 'Kjell', 'Bjarne', 'Sven', 'Nordin', 'share', 'room', 'rehab', 'center', 'get', 'along', 'so', 'well', 'when', 'are', 'released', 'state', 'decides', 'get', 'supervised', 'housing', 'roommates', 'once', 'again', 'course', 'going', 'out', 'real', 'world', 'even', 'help', 'new', 'social', 'worker', 'Frank', 'Jrgen', 'Langhelle', 'see', 'are', 'willing', 'least', 'give', 'try.At', 'first', 'giving', 'try', 'tough', 'uphill', 'battle', 'even', 'hearts', 'want', 'succeed', 'Going', 'supermarket', 'answering', 'telephone', 'create', 'huge', 'amount', 'stress', 'especially', 'shy', 'sensitive', 'Elling', 'Kjell', 'own', 'emotional', 'baggage', 'particular', 'obsessed', 'finding', 'girlfriend', 'never', 'been', 'alone', 'woman', 'Kjell', 'remarkably', 'shy', 'women', 'never', 'what', 'say.Things', 'gradually', 'begin', 'change', 'Elling', 'gradually', 'fears', 'going', 'apartment', 'especially', 'first', 'attempts', 'fail', 'social', 'worker', 'Frank', 'threaten', 'kick', 'apartment', 'send', 'back', 'hospital', 'do', ""n't"", 'confront', 'fears', 'Elling', 'eventually', 'poetry', 'meeting', 'become', 'emerging', 'mysterious', 'poet', 'Kjell', 'love', 'pregnant', 'woman', 'who', 'apartment', 'building', 'woman', 'Reidun', 'Nordsletten', 'Marit', 'Pia', 'Jacobsen', 'fall', 'Kjell', 'too', 'over', 'dinner.Of', 'course', 'plot', 'can', 'go', 'anywhere', 'here', 'time', 'Elling', 'new', 'friend', 'named', 'Alfons', 'Jrgensen', 'Per', 'Christensen', 'Alfons', 'Elling', 'come', 'shell', 'Elling', 'write', 'more', 'poetry', 'reading', 'Elling', 'work', 'Meanwhile', 'Kjell', 'own', 'direction', 'increasingly', 'involved', 'Reidun', 'could', 'threaten', 'friendship', 'Elling', 'Kjell', 'how', 'will', 'handle', 'How', 'might', 'Reidun', 'react', 'out', 'Kjell', 'recently', 'released', 'institution', 'will', 'dump', 'not', 'what', 'Elling', 'poetry', 'work', 'will', 'Elling', 'turn', 'back', 'Kjell', 'focus', 'new', 'profession', 'Watch', 'find', 'out', 'DVD', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'nicer', 'had', 'been', 'bonus', 'featurette', 'get', 'scene', 'selection', 'three', 'trailers', 'other', 'films', 'However', 'film', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'actually', 'minor', 'complaint.Elling', 'will', 'move', 'even', 'educate', 'people', 'what', 'mentally', 'ill', 'can', 'accomplish', 'problems', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'fans', 'actors', 'movie', 'people', 'interested', 'human', 'dramas', 'psychology', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'get', 'film', 'DVD']",Elling

""Elling"" is a great movie no matter who you are or where you're from. The ""odd-couple""-genre is almost the only film-genre that works great regardless of nationality, and ""Elling"" is no exception. This movie is about two ""troubled"" middle-aged men: Elling & Kjell-Bjarne. They are both virgins and one of them (Elling) has been living with his mother his entire life (until her death), and thus is the more ""academic"" of the two (Kjell-Bjarne is the complete opposite). The norwegian government has decided that these two weirdos are ripe for moving from the mental institution they have been living the past few years, to an apartment at ""Majorstua"" right in the middle of the norwegian capital, Oslo(!)

Crammer,"[7, 7]","This Norwegian film tells the story of two not-right-in-the-head men who meet at the state institution where Elling has been sent following his mother's death.  Elling is basically agoraphobic -- had spent all forty years of his life at home with his mother.  Kjell is a big, imposing man with a strong interest in sex but a childish mind and personality.  The two become friends so when the authorities decide to try to move them into the community, they are set up as room-mates in a state-sponsored apartment.  Elling is afraid to leave the apartment and neither can answer a telephone.  The social worker assigned to their case pushes them to grow (like leaving the apartment and answering the phone) and gradually they start to function in their own odd way.This movie is quite funny in parts.  It would be easy to make a Hallmark kind of sweet, sentimental movie with this plot, but it isn't.  It has a sharper edge than that.The performances by the two leads are amazing.

It follows the lives of two friends Elling and Kjell Bjarne as they try to adjust to a normal life after having spent two years together in a mental institution as roomies. Elling and Kjell Bjarne are so unalike Elling is the knowledgably, sophisticated and weedy looking one and while Kjell Bjarne is more of a brute prone to angry outbursts.  Elling is interested in poetry while Kjell Bjarne is more interested in sex.  They are given an opportunity to show that they can cope on their own when the state decides to give them an apartment and a social worker (Frank).  In the beginning even the simplest things like shopping or answering the phone are obstacles they must learn to overcome.There are some serious moments but on the whole the film is very upbeat. You find yourself rooting for Elling and Kjell Bjarne hoping that the friendship they have built doesn't come tumbling down as they each make new friends and are drawn in differing directions.  It's a touching movie with laughs and a few tugged heartstrings. There is a moment at the end of the movie that has you more than hoping for an upbeat ending.Don't let the fact that Elling a foreign film put you off.

Agoraphobic and unable to face life without her...""Mama handled practical matters,"" he says. ""I was more into ideology.""  Once extricated, Elling is taken to a mental hospital.  There he shares a room with Kjell Bjarne, the orangutang, as Elling calls him. Kjell is a 40-year-old virgin, a lummox, obsessed with food and sex, and given to banging his head on whatever is handy when life confuses him. Which is always.  Both men have much in common, one being the victim of a uncaring alcoholic mother, the other the victim of one who was altogether too caring.After two years, the Norwegian social welfare system determines they are ready for recycling back into society. Elling and Kjell are given a social worker and an apartment and told to fend for themselves. They learn to cope with frightening ordeals like grocery shopping and answering the phone, and discover new joys, like phone sex, and new sorrows, like the high cost of phone sex.  They bicker, Kjell pounds his head, and baby step by baby step, they make their way in the world.The film never patronizes Elling or Kjell Bjarne. This is not an inane feel good movie. It's more comparable to ""Of Mice and Men,"" but with Lennie and Lennie, no George.  Excellent dialogue (the subtitle captioning is very good), sharp editing and sophisticated cinematography give the film a brisk pace and keep things moving forward. The humor ranges from sly and subversive to laugh out loud.There certainly is no lack of warmth and emotion, but we never approach pathos. You really want these fellows to make it and to fullfill their ambitions, which in Kjell's case means finding a woman, and in Elling's...okay, this one is a little tough to explain. Poetry, pop culture and packaged sauerkraut are involved. But a dream is a dream and who are we to judge.  Their fragility makes every success, whether it's ordering a meal in a restaurant or making a friend, a milestone. Both characters are so likable and so vulnerable -- and so believable -- you can't help but root for them as they becoming part of the world. Despite the films lack of sentimentality, there are lump in the throat moments.""Elling"" received an Academy Award Nomination for Best Foreign Language Film in 2001.

They have a fairly streetwise social worker who looks after them from time to time but Elling and his roommate are pretty much on their own.

Their individual struggles with their obsessions as they try to develop relationships outside of their circle of two are incredibly filmed, and the viewer is treated to what I believe is the main theme of this film, the incredibly deep and strong love and affection that the two of them have for each other as they just try to make it trough the day.Finally, this movie is certainly not for the veiwer that just wants to sit back and BE ENTERTAINED it requires some thought, unless you speak Norwegian, and some empathy to the story as it is wonderfully developed by a super director.....",5,One of the best true love stories I have ever seen ......,1102291200,"12 6, 2004",2004,1844,"['can', 'not', 'believe', 'movie', 'been', 'reviewed', 'comedy', 'Just', 'are', 'laughs', 'uncomfortable', 'moments', 'are', 'funny', 'NOT', 'make', 'comedy', 'rather', 'film', 'study', 'two', 'disparate', 'characters', 'who', 'truly', 'have', 'relationship', 'other', 'OK', 'now', 'hold', 'horses', 'NOT', 'gay', 'relationship', 'Trust', 'marvel', 'film', 'were', 'made', 'USA', 'sure', 'director', 'could', 'not', 'avoid', 'temptation', 'injecting', 'stupidity', 'film.Seems', 'movies', 'today', 'side', 'ocean', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'two', 'men', 'having', 'kind', 'relationship', 'gay', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'CONDITIONED', 'now', 'actually', 'waited', 'whole', 'movie', 'end', 'realized', 'what', 'wonderfull', 'non', 'gay', 'movie', 'film', 'young', 'men', 'are', 'released', 'community', 'spending', 'four', 'years', 'so', 'rooming', 'together', 'mental', 'institution', 'Elling', 'agrophobia', 'giving', 'total', 'panic', 'fear', 'leaving', 'own', 'room', 'never', 'mind', 'apartment', 'roomate', 'bumbling', 'quiet', 'gentle', 'giant', 'rarely', 'basically', 'obsesses', 'sex', 'food', 'are', 'moved', 'state', 'two', 'bedroom', 'apartment', 'Oslo', 'preparation', 'integrate', 'back', 'society', 'individual', 'struggles', 'obsessions', 'try', 'develop', 'relationships', 'circle', 'two', 'are', 'incredibly', 'filmed', 'viewer', 'treated', 'what', 'believe', 'main', 'theme', 'film', 'incredibly', 'deep', 'strong', 'love', 'affection', 'two', 'have', 'other', 'just', 'try', 'make', 'day.Finally', 'movie', 'certainly', 'not', 'veiwer', 'just', 'sit', 'back', 'BE', 'ENTERTAINED', 'thought', 'speak', 'Norwegian', 'empathy', 'story', 'wonderfully', 'developed', 'super', 'director', '..']",Elling

The storyline centers around two people living in an institution.  Eventually, it is decided to allow them to leave and to adjust to society in Oslo, Norway.  From then on, this film takes one on an engaging ride as these two try their hand at something that they are not used to.  The two main protagonists--Elling and Kjell Bjarne--are played by Per Christian Ellefsen and Sven Nordin.  Both perform solidly in their attention-grabbing roles as polar opposite friends.  In addition, the rest of the cast turn in memorable roles--for example, Jorgen Langhelle's portrayal of social worker Frank Asli.  Elling also gives one an insightful look into what Norwegian society is like.

Perhaps, but I can't remember ever caring about Oscar and Felix as much as I cared about Elling and Kjell Bjarne.  The entire audience was rooting for them, and the heartwarming ending made my eyes sting with tears of real emotion.  I challenge anyone not to feel the same.In spite of lukewarm reception by American critics, Elling is bound to be an audience pleaser.  It's full of the knee-slapping variety of funny while simultaneously featuring many moments that pull at the heartstrings.  The story follows 2 men as they venture from the safe confines of a mental institution in rural Norway.  Elling (the serious, dramatic character) longs only for a basic grasp on the world around him; Kjell Bjarne, the hulking, comedic character, wants something far more basic (though not necessarily easier to come by).  Their affection for each other, oddly enough is not the least bit hard to believe.  That fact stands as proof that the writing is superb.I can't recommend this film any more heartily.
