866769,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B0006GAI5U,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[0, 3]","I don't believe I have ever sit through an entire comedy film before without even cracking a smile until I watched Bernie Mac's dud, Mr. 3000.  With one-sided jokes, uneven editing, and a very poor story, I am surprised that anyone would enjoy watching this film.  It is quite possibly the worst representation of Mac's humor that I have ever seen.  I am not sure what the filmmakers were trying to achieve with this film, but it felt like there was plenty of editing left on the floor, a bad match for Bernie Mac, and an overall story that really just didn't spark at any time.  From the beginning of this film until the very unclimactic and predictable ending, I didn't laugh one bit and this was supposed to be ""very funny"" (if you look at the cover box).  There was something amuck with this film, and I plan to discover what it was.Casting was a downer for this film.  Outside of Mac, there was really no showcased talent.  Angela Bassett was completely miscast as a believable sports writer.  I felt she really hindered the film with her wishy-washy performance that never seemed to go anywhere.  She kept jumping in and out of character that it felt as if she was just interested in the money instead of the script.  There was something emotional there, but (as I will go into later) it seemed as if it was all edited out to allow more face time of Bernie Mac.  I do believe that the ultimate downfall of this film was Bernie Mac.  There was nothing funny about him in the least bit.  The writing gave him nothing to build upon, the direction seemed very stale giving Bernie a very plastic image when he moved, and Mac's acting was not the best for this role.  I am not sure if there was supposed to be more emotion behind his character, or perhaps more emotion in the story, but there was not one good scene with Mac that I can recall.  A good way to grade this is to count how many times you doze off during this film, and for me it was four ... which is not a good sign.  The relationship between Michael Rispoli and Mac seemed forced to the extent where they looked and felt like actors just reading their lines.  Was there any rehearsal in this film?  It felt as if everything was done on the first take, then the rest of the cast took the day off.As if the acting wasn't the tip of the iceberg, I felt this was the worst story contrived for a film.  Here is where I get a bit fuzzy.  Was it the story that needed some definite attention, or was it the editing?  I couldn't tell which was worse.  Everytime we would get moving in a decent direction, suddenly we were pulled back in another without any warning or reason.  Two scenes that I can think about were when Mac talks to the star player about being a team player and overnight he listens to Mac.  How believable was that?  Where was the tension, the ultimate realization, and the gritty truth?  I saw none of this, could it have been edited out or was it the story just didn't allow it?  The second was when Mac found his fame again.  This came out of left field, caused some trouble with the story and characters then suddenly fixed itself without any warning or repercussion.  Who could have allowed this to happen?  Mr. 3000 felt like a High School freshman's term paper that forgot to connect the paragraphs.  I just felt like I was jumping around the baseball field without any parental guidance.  This film shamed the Baseball Hall of Fame, and I am surprised that they did nothing to try to stop it.  Tom Arnold was in it for God's sake.  Can nothing be said for that?Nonetheless, with sub-par acting and a story without any connectiveness, I had to wonder why this film did so well.  I remember Bernie Mac as this stylish comedian with a voice that speaks to the American public, not Stan Ross, an unfunny baseball player who seems to have a chip on his shoulder for no apparent reason.  Could we not get any backstroke on this character?  Again, story or editing, which do I blame?  If you couldn't tell already, I completely disliked this film.  The customers at my video store seem to want this title more than any other title, and I cannot for the likes of me figure out why.  There are no redeemable scenes in this film or anything worth enjoying.  This was a disappointing film with its lackluster performances and shoddy story.  The only great aspect that this film had going for it is that it continued to fuel my complete hatred for the sports genre film.Overall, skip it.  You are missing nothing and, in fact, by not watching this film you will probably end up enjoying the work of Bernie Mac much more.  For me, my eyes have been ruined and my overall taste of Bernie Mac has fallen quite a few notches on the infamous POLE OF COMEDY!Grade: * out of *****",1,You don't like me because I sign

866773,A5L5ITYHNCJYL,B0006GAI5U,"Chris Honaker ""reviewman""","[4, 5]","Mr. 3000 may not bring in the laughs that you would expect from one of the original kings of comedy known as Bernie Mac, but the film has a very light hearted story that still makes it enjoyable for viewing.  Mac is (Stan Ross), one of the greatest hitters in the league is out for that 3,000 hit.  So does it make him a lovable hero in the eyes of the Milwaukee Brewer crowd? Not exactly.  Ross was an ego manic that said how he felt no matter if the news reporters, fans, or little kids were present.  The man was so full of himself that after he got that 3,000 hit, he quit the team right when they needed him the most, which was around playoff time.  The staff, coaches, and players from the past and present hated his guts even more.  Almost a decade later and on the edge of turning 50, Milwaukee Brewer president decided to retire his jersey and make him a nomination for the hall of fame as that would further lift up his ego.  However, a report showed that 3 of his hits didn't count and he was no longer the 3,000 man.  Stan does the only thing he knows how to do to keep his career in the record books, that was to come back to the game that he once mastered.  Of course, the team or the coaches were not pleased to see him back especially after referring to them as little leaguers.  Things got even worse, when Stan went 5 games striking out and the only player on the team not to get a hit.  As he's trying to get back in shape and deal with the stress of being made fun of everywhere he went, he decides to rekindle a relationship with an old flame (Angela Bassett) who is back in town and reporting on the team.This was the only highlight of his lonely life.  The team continued to lose and noone would even listen to Stan's advice and are seeing a shot at ending the season at 3rd place slipping away.  After the team's recent loss the press interviewed the best player on the team who's got the same arrogance, skills, and selfishness that Stan once had.  Stan interrupted the guy's interview and gave him some friendly advice to try and prevent him for being what he has been his entire life.  For once, we see Stan in a different light as he became a team player has he was laughing and cutting up jokes with the team, uplifting the players spirit when things were going wrong and giving them pointers on the other team.  The team started listening and when Stan made his 2,298th hit, the team started winning games and were on the verge on getting 3rd place but the goal would be put to the test as they placed one of the best teams in the league, the Houston Astros.  Of course, Stan was back to getting publicity from the Best Damn Sports Show and Jay Leno which was nice to see him getting the respect back of being one of the all time greats, but his ego started to kick back in.  Making guest appearances on these shows when he promised his old flame and teammates to meet him at practice for something very important (possibly a perposal) was the sign that the old Stan was coming back.  In the final game of the season with Stan one hit away from proclaiming the title ""Mr. 3000"", Stan recalls his statement made from his peers that reminded him of his old ways and decides that he didn't really care about that hit and the hall of fame induction.  I don't want to give away the ending and some of the events that led up to it, but I will close the review by saying this.  Stan does retire after the game, but he ends his career in a UN-selfish way.  People no longer remembered Stan the jerk.  Sure, the cocky attitude was still there, but the light hearted side of him was what was shining the most.  Stan may not be Mr. 3000, but he ended a successful career on top.  This movie reminded me alot Angels In The Outfield and the first Mighty Ducks on which a person who's successful past created an ego that noone wanted to be around with but a few things and people helped inspire them and make them better people in the end.  I think the movie is worth checking out.",4,good enough for me,1107993600,"02 10, 2005",2005,3997,"['Mr.', '3000', 'may', 'not', 'bring', 'laughs', 'would', 'expect', 'one', 'original', 'kings', 'comedy', 'known', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'film', 'very', 'light', 'hearted', 'story', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'viewing', 'Mac', 'Stan', 'Ross', 'one', 'greatest', 'hitters', 'league', 'out', '3,000', 'hit', 'So', 'make', 'lovable', 'hero', 'eyes', 'Milwaukee', 'Brewer', 'crowd', 'Not', 'exactly', 'Ross', 'was', 'ego', 'manic', 'said', 'how', 'felt', 'matter', 'news', 'reporters', 'fans', 'little', 'kids', 'were', 'present', 'man', 'was', 'so', 'full', 'got', '3,000', 'hit', 'quit', 'team', 'right', 'when', 'needed', 'most', 'was', 'playoff', 'time', 'staff', 'coaches', 'players', 'past', 'present', 'hated', 'guts', 'even', 'more', 'Almost', 'decade', 'later', 'edge', 'turning', '50', 'Milwaukee', 'Brewer', 'president', 'decided', 'retire', 'jersey', 'make', 'nomination', 'hall', 'fame', 'would', 'further', 'lift', 'up', 'ego', 'However', 'report', 'showed', '3', 'hits', 'did', ""n't"", 'count', 'was', 'no', 'longer', '3,000', 'man', 'Stan', 'only', 'thing', 'how', 'do', 'keep', 'career', 'record', 'books', 'was', 'come', 'back', 'game', 'once', 'mastered', 'course', 'team', 'coaches', 'were', 'not', 'pleased', 'see', 'back', 'especially', 'referring', 'little', 'leaguers', 'Things', 'got', 'even', 'worse', 'when', 'Stan', 'went', '5', 'games', 'striking', 'out', 'only', 'player', 'team', 'not', 'get', 'hit', 'trying', 'get', 'back', 'shape', 'deal', 'stress', 'being', 'made', 'fun', 'everywhere', 'went', 'rekindle', 'relationship', 'old', 'flame', 'Angela', 'Bassett', 'who', 'back', 'town', 'reporting', 'team.This', 'was', 'only', 'highlight', 'lonely', 'life', 'team', 'continued', 'lose', 'noone', 'would', 'even', 'listen', 'Stan', 'advice', 'are', 'seeing', 'shot', 'ending', 'season', '3rd', 'place', 'slipping', 'away', 'team', 'recent', 'loss', 'press', 'interviewed', 'best', 'player', 'team', 'who', 'got', 'same', 'arrogance', 'skills', 'selfishness', 'Stan', 'once', 'had', 'Stan', 'interrupted', 'guy', 'interview', 'gave', 'friendly', 'advice', 'try', 'prevent', 'being', 'what', 'been', 'entire', 'life', 'once', 'see', 'Stan', 'different', 'light', 'became', 'team', 'player', 'was', 'laughing', 'cutting', 'up', 'jokes', 'team', 'uplifting', 'players', 'spirit', 'when', 'things', 'were', 'going', 'wrong', 'giving', 'pointers', 'other', 'team', 'team', 'started', 'listening', 'when', 'Stan', 'made', '2,298th', 'hit', 'team', 'started', 'winning', 'games', 'were', 'verge', 'getting', '3rd', 'place', 'goal', 'would', 'be', 'put', 'test', 'placed', 'one', 'best', 'teams', 'league', 'Houston', 'Astros', 'course', 'Stan', 'was', 'back', 'getting', 'publicity', 'Best', 'Damn', 'Sports', 'Show', 'Jay', 'Leno', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'getting', 'respect', 'back', 'being', 'one', 'time', 'greats', 'ego', 'started', 'kick', 'back', 'Making', 'guest', 'appearances', 'shows', 'when', 'promised', 'old', 'flame', 'teammates', 'meet', 'practice', 'something', 'very', 'important', 'possibly', 'perposal', 'was', 'sign', 'old', 'Stan', 'was', 'coming', 'back', 'final', 'game', 'season', 'Stan', 'one', 'hit', 'away', 'proclaiming', 'title', 'Mr.', '3000', 'Stan', 'statement', 'made', 'peers', 'reminded', 'old', 'ways', 'decides', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'hit', 'hall', 'fame', 'induction', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'ending', 'events', 'led', 'up', 'will', 'close', 'review', 'saying', 'Stan', 'retire', 'game', 'career', 'UN-selfish', 'way', 'People', 'no', 'longer', 'remembered', 'Stan', 'jerk', 'Sure', 'cocky', 'attitude', 'was', 'still', 'there', 'light', 'hearted', 'side', 'was', 'what', 'was', 'shining', 'most', 'Stan', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'Mr.', '3000', 'ended', 'successful', 'career', 'top', 'movie', 'reminded', 'alot', 'Angels', 'Outfield', 'first', 'Mighty', 'Ducks', 'person', 'who', 'successful', 'past', 'created', 'ego', 'noone', 'wanted', 'be', 'few', 'things', 'people', 'helped', 'inspire', 'make', 'better', 'people', 'end', 'think', 'movie', 'checking', 'out']",N/A
866774,AUHG8KSHI529U,B0006GAI5U,Craig Matteson,"[3, 3]","I find Bernie Mac engaging and humorous rather than funny in a joke telling sense.  Mr. 3000 benefits from this as more of a dramatic movie with funny moments than as a comedy.  That the marketing campaign kept emphasizing it was a comedy is probably one of the reasons it did not do so well at the box office.  Bernie Mac and the other stars give good performances and, for a sports movie, this has some things to offer.  Unlike ""Major League"", it is not a cartoon.However, when you say the movie is ""Very Funny"" right under the title you create an expectation that this movie never intended to deliver.  This movie is about a character who gets an unexpected and unwanted second chance to set things right.  However, what gets set right isn't exactly what he intended to do when he began the journey.  You see, that isn't a premise for comedy although humorous things do happen along the way, it is not a setup for one joke after another.Stan Ross (Bernie Mac) is an extremely talented hitter who is so in love with his own talents and image that he simply has no clue how this affects his relations with his teammates and the fans.  When he hits his three thousandth hit he ends up ripping it out of the hands of the kid who ended up with the ball.  The press gets on him after the game and Ross responds by retiring from the game even though his team is in the midst of a championship run.  He figures that with his three thousand hits he can't be denied his place in the Hall of Fame.Nine years later he still isn't in the hall and during his shenanigans to try and swing the public to pressure the voters to put him in the league finds out that three of his hits were double counted.  So, Ross figures the only thing to do is to jump in late in the present season to get his three hits.  It turns out to not be as easy as he had hoped.During these weeks we get to see the management's attitude towards the ""sanctity"" of the game and Ross's own appreciation for what he had so callously walked away from.  The end of the movie is not exactly predictable, but very nice.The problem is that all the swearing in the film (even though there is a very funny series of bits with a Japanese pitcher trying to get Yankee swearing right) and the somewhat frank (but modest) sexuality with Angela Bassett (who is very good in this film) make it a bit hard to justify as a family film.  Unless your family cusses and talks about sex openly, I guess.Better film than you might expect from its box office receipts, but a pitifully misguided ad campaign did set the wrong expectations for the public.  And, if they wanted it to be a family film, less cussing and putting in romance for sex would have been better choices.",3,"Not really a comedy, but a better film than you might expect.

Some elements of the plot are weak and needlessly bothersome, the main character's growth as a person was a little weebly-wobbly, and - worst of all - an effective ending is somewhat marred by the fact that what happens could basically never actually happen in a game of major league baseball.  On paper, the movie probably wouldn't deserve more than three stars; the main character's ego makes for a character you might have a hard time pulling for - but, thanks to the casting director, Bernie Mac landed that plum role, and he pretty much saves the script single-handedly.  You can't help but like Bernie Mac; he's so naturally funny and entertaining that people would probably buy tickets just to sit and watch him sit in front of a dryer waiting for his clothes to dry.The premise of this film is rather simple.  Stan Ross (Bernie Mac) was a rather arrogant, obnoxious baseball player who left baseball as soon as he got his 3000th hit - leaving his Brewers teammates right in the middle of a clutch drive to the playoffs.  Reporters and sports talking heads have no use for him at all (for good reason), but the fans still seem to like him.  He does well for himself after baseball, opening up all sorts of ""3000"" stores, building his whole life around his Mr. 3000 persona.  Nine years after retiring, he still hasn't made it into the Hall of Fame, though (and when he boasts that 3000 hits should basically guarantee you a place in Cooperstown, he's telling the truth); he's close, though, having come up only four votes short the year before.  Then disaster strikes in the form of a fact check of his records; it turns out that one of his three-hit games was actually counted twice.  In an instant, Mr. 3000 has suddenly become Mr. 2997.  Thus, at age 47, Ross dons the uniform again and sets out to get the three hits that will reestablish himself as Mr. 3000 and hopefully win him that long overdue invitation to Cooperstown.At first, it's all about Ross' ego.  Never a team player, Ross insults his new teammates before he even suits up, and then he proceeds to go 0-for-everything at the plate.  As time goes on, though, Ross begins to change - although his ego is never far away and keeps returning from time to time.  He finally gets a hit, and the Brewers start to actually win some games.  Naturally, both Ross' personal and professional paths converge on the final game of the season.  Sure, the ending is a little predictable, but there's nothing wrong with an ending that makes you feel good.It's amazing how you can hardly go wrong with a baseball movie.  Sure, the sport can be a little boring to watch at times, yet the excitement of each game's pivotal moments can be electrifying, and there were a couple of such electrifying moments in this movie.  More importantly, though, Mr. 3000 made me laugh out loud on several occasions, and that is the main reason I consider the film a very successful comedy.",4,"The plot has its weak spots, but this is one funny movie",1114560000,"04 27, 2005",2005,3226,"['Personally', ""'m"", 'really', 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'Mr.', '3000', ""n't"", 'get', 'better', 'ratings', 'viewers', 'When', 'talk', 'straight-up', 'comedy', 'first', 'question', 'have', 'answer', 'was', 'funny', 'funny', 'good', 'comedy', 'Mr.', '3000', 'funny', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'better', 'elements', 'plot', 'are', 'weak', 'needlessly', 'bothersome', 'main', 'character', 'growth', 'person', 'was', 'little', 'weebly-wobbly', 'worst', 'effective', 'ending', 'somewhat', 'marred', 'fact', 'what', 'could', 'basically', 'never', 'actually', 'happen', 'game', 'major', 'league', 'baseball', 'paper', 'movie', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'more', 'three', 'stars', 'main', 'character', 'ego', 'character', 'might', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'pulling', 'thanks', 'casting', 'director', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'landed', 'plum', 'role', 'pretty', 'much', 'script', 'single-handedly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'so', 'naturally', 'funny', 'entertaining', 'people', 'would', 'probably', 'buy', 'tickets', 'just', 'sit', 'watch', 'sit', 'front', 'dryer', 'waiting', 'clothes', 'dry.The', 'premise', 'film', 'rather', 'simple', 'Stan', 'Ross', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'was', 'rather', 'arrogant', 'obnoxious', 'baseball', 'player', 'who', 'left', 'baseball', 'as', 'soon', 'got', '3000th', 'hit', 'leaving', 'Brewers', 'teammates', 'right', 'middle', 'clutch', 'drive', 'playoffs', 'Reporters', 'sports', 'talking', 'heads', 'have', 'use', 'good', 'reason', 'fans', 'still', 'seem', 'like', 'well', 'baseball', 'opening', 'up', 'sorts', '3000', 'stores', 'building', 'whole', 'life', 'Mr.', '3000', 'persona', 'Nine', 'years', 'retiring', 'still', ""n't"", 'made', 'Hall', 'Fame', 'when', '3000', 'hits', 'should', 'basically', 'guarantee', 'place', 'Cooperstown', 'telling', 'truth', 'close', 'though', 'having', 'come', 'up', 'only', 'four', 'votes', 'short', 'year', 'before', 'Then', 'disaster', 'strikes', 'form', 'fact', 'check', 'records', 'out', 'one', 'three-hit', 'games', 'was', 'actually', 'counted', 'twice', 'instant', 'Mr.', '3000', 'suddenly', 'become', 'Mr.', '2997', 'Thus', 'age', '47', 'Ross', 'uniform', 'again', 'out', 'get', 'three', 'hits', 'will', 'reestablish', 'Mr.', '3000', 'hopefully', 'win', 'long', 'overdue', 'invitation', 'Cooperstown.At', 'first', 'Ross', 'ego', 'team', 'player', 'Ross', 'new', 'teammates', 'even', 'suits', 'up', 'then', 'go', '0-for-everything', 'plate', 'time', 'Ross', 'change', 'ego', 'never', 'far', 'away', 'returning', 'time', 'time', 'finally', 'hit', 'Brewers', 'start', 'actually', 'win', 'games', 'Naturally', 'Ross', 'personal', 'professional', 'paths', 'converge', 'final', 'game', 'season', 'Sure', 'ending', 'little', 'predictable', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'ending', 'feel', 'good.It', 'amazing', 'how', 'can', 'hardly', 'go', 'wrong', 'baseball', 'movie', 'Sure', 'sport', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'boring', 'watch', 'times', 'yet', 'excitement', 'game', 'pivotal', 'moments', 'can', 'be', 'electrifying', 'were', 'couple', 'such', 'electrifying', 'moments', 'movie', 'More', 'importantly', 'though', 'Mr.', '3000', 'made', 'out', 'loud', 'several', 'occasions', 'main', 'reason', 'consider', 'film', 'very', 'successful', 'comedy']",N/A

Years later, it is discovered that there was an error in calculating the number of hits he had and that, in fact, he fell short; he only had 2,997.

Bernie Mac plays it small here, but he still does the best he can with a one-dimensional character. All Stan Ross(Mac) cares about is his record, making it into the baseball Hall of Fame, and himself, himself, himself. Mac was an easy choice to play a loud, cocky character like this.There are a few chuckles here and there in the movie, but nothing to make you burst out laughing. Some things were tired, the swearing in front of kids, the obligatory love interest with the obligatory songs of Marvin Gaye and such every love scene. The baseball action is tailored towards the movie, rather than viewing it as a live game, but it worked really well showing Ross' mishaps on Sportscenter rather than straight in the movie. Things always seem to be funnier on Sportscenter recaps with Stuart Scott commentating.Yeah, some of it may be cliched, but it threw me off how Ross went from feeling the ""team"" spirit to flaunting himself and his greatness again, before making a ""sacrifice"" at the end. The end was surprising to me, some may see it coming, but it wasn't necessarily the usual kind of ending to movies like this. I love how he got his first 3,000th hit, and if you think about it, they actually made good use of his sparse hits after the comeback. The 2,998th one was classic, and one of the high-points in this movie.The movie is actually better than those pitiful trailers made it out to be, in case you're worried. I couln't get over how awkward Mac looks in a baseball uni, but by the end of the flick, he more than embodies the character(and the uni)! Not a must-see, but definitely a timeworthy-see.

A-n-y-w-a-y-s, after Ross smacks his 3000th base hit, he immediately announces that he's through with baseball and is retiring right then and there. His team is currently in the run for the pennant; however, Stan Ross is all about Stan Ross, and could care less about his team, his follow players, or at this point even the fans.

Stan Ross has become quite the entrepreneur with his moniker name ""Mr. 3000"". There is Mr. 3000 Bar, Mr. 3000 Cuts, Mr. 3000 Paws Pet Supply, and Mr. 3000 Woks Chinese Restaurant; all which are inclusive in the Mr. 3000 Shopping Center. Mr. Ross has everything going for him, except his ultimate goal of all, the induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame. In which at this point of the movie, Stan Ross is within 4 votes of reaching this goal. However, while reviewing Mr. Ross' baseball career statistics, it is discovered that he is actually 3 runs short of his 3000th hit plateau. With this discovery, so go his ""Hall of Fame"" dreams, and the Stan ""Mr. 3000"" Ross franchise. All of which, forces Stan Ross back into professional baseball to regain his 3 lost runs.

His entire life centers around the fact that he hit 3,000 hits.Stan Ross' main goal is to make it into the Hall of Fame but under review it turns out that 3 of his hits were counted twice and it kicked him out of the running for the Hall of Fame (mostly because nobody even likes him).  So, Stan decides to come back to claim his 3 hits, win back his legacy, and continue his campaign into the Hall of Fame.Even though he has been gone for nine years, the game has changed.  The balls are faster, the athletes younger, and the training is more high tech.  And to top it off, Stan is older as well.In other words, Stan needs to change.  Not just physically, but his attitude as well.  The ending, though predictable, was well worth getting to and fairly satisfying.  Since this is a character movie, it all came down to a choice.  And, unlike other movies like this, Stan doesn't hesitate on his choice, he just makes it.  I liked that, I liked that a lot.  It could have been blown out and that would have ruined the ending for me.The love interest that Stan chases was actually the only boring part of the movie.  After watching a few of them I just started fast forwarding those scenes.  Believe me, I didn't miss a thing.  I know it needs to be in there to attract certain demographics, but I found it boring and pointless.  So if you are a guy, trust me, just fast forward these parts.Entertaining and funny... perfect for a good weekend video.",4,Bernie Mac Nails It,1113868800,"04 19, 2005",2005,1743,"['can', 'imagine', 'very', 'few', 'people', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'Stan', 'Ross', 'as', 'well', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'did', 'was', 'delicate', 'balance', 'playing', 'jerk', 'still', 'coming', 'somewhat', 'likeable', 'Likeable', 'enough', 'forgive', 'anyways.Bernie', 'Mac', 'Stan', 'Ross', 'professional', 'ball', 'player', 'who', 'hit', '3,000', 'entire', 'life', 'centers', 'fact', 'hit', '3,000', 'hits.Stan', 'Ross', 'main', 'goal', 'make', 'Hall', 'Fame', 'review', 'out', '3', 'hits', 'were', 'counted', 'twice', 'kicked', 'running', 'Hall', 'Fame', 'mostly', 'nobody', 'even', 'So', 'Stan', 'come', 'back', 'claim', '3', 'hits', 'win', 'back', 'legacy', 'continue', 'campaign', 'Hall', 'Fame.Even', 'been', 'gone', 'nine', 'years', 'game', 'changed', 'balls', 'are', 'faster', 'athletes', 'younger', 'training', 'more', 'high', 'tech', 'top', 'off', 'Stan', 'older', 'well.In', 'other', 'words', 'Stan', 'change', 'Not', 'just', 'physically', 'attitude', 'as', 'well', 'ending', 'predictable', 'was', 'well', 'worth', 'getting', 'fairly', 'satisfying', 'character', 'movie', 'came', 'down', 'choice', 'other', 'movies', 'Stan', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'choice', 'just', 'liked', 'liked', 'lot', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'blown', 'out', 'would', 'have', 'ruined', 'ending', 'me.The', 'love', 'interest', 'Stan', 'chases', 'was', 'actually', 'only', 'boring', 'part', 'movie', 'watching', 'few', 'just', 'started', 'fast', 'forwarding', 'scenes', 'Believe', 'did', ""n't"", 'miss', 'thing', 'know', 'be', 'there', 'attract', 'certain', 'demographics', 'found', 'boring', 'pointless', 'So', 'are', 'guy', 'trust', 'just', 'fast', 'forward', 'parts.Entertaining', 'funny', 'perfect', 'good', 'weekend', 'video']",N/A

Outstanding in many ways it could have been great if the director had followed through on Stan Ross' (Bernie Mac) relationships with the many rich characters sprinkled throughout the film.By now everyone knows that the film is about Stan Ross, a self-centered, big league baseball player with 3000 base hits in his career.  Upon achieving that milestone he hangs it up mid-season, suffering from the love-me complex from which many of today's sports stars suffer.  To Stan Ross it is all about him.  As in real life, the fans are forgiving and love him for his accomplishment, but he is insufferable in the process.8 years later, Stan is grousing about not being voted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.  He stirs the pot with the fans to put pressure on the sports writers who vote and make it happen, so his career is looked over again.  Low and behold he is 3 hits shy of the 3000 mark.  Stan vows to get those 3 hits and claim his rightful title.  How at 47 does he make it back into the majors?  A publicity stunt.  Stan played for the Brewers and the powers that be know they can fill seats with fans who want to see Stan get those 3 hits.Along the way Stan realizes it is not all about him.  With younger self-centered players around him he sees in them the man he was.  And he doesn't like what he sees.  Ultimately he rights some wrongs and makes a huge sacrifice to change everything in the end.

866788,A2A6NH6DPE0VXR,B0006GAI5U,"Jim ""Pimmy""","[0, 0]","Bernie Mac is at his best here I think as a full of himself baseball player. He retires and flatleaves his team and coach after he gets his 3000's hit. Turns out he really needs 3 more hits if he wants to make it to 3000 and be in the hall of fame. So after 9 years of being retired he decides to get back in the game. It doesn't prove to be as easy as he thought and he needs to get back in shape first. Plus when he gets back in the game he has trouble even getting another hit. The story sounds predictable but the script is smart and has good ideas. He learns to be a team player  and not just to be out for himself. Scenes like where he gives a cocky player that reminds him of himself advice work the most. Plus his scenes with Angela Bassett are good too, they have pretty good chemestrty as well.What I find funny though is that the coachs barely even talk, you just see the players talking and fooling around and the coachs just sit there like they're in comas. It is funny when Paul Sorvino as the coach finally talks and does something though. This still isn't a bad baseball movie at all though.

866789,A2PXHFGJZBNLXB,B0006GAI5U,Kenji Fujishima,"[4, 4]","Call me a sap if you like, but I think MR. 3000 tells a beautiful story. Predictable? Maybe. Cliched? Possibly. And yet, it's so well-written and directed, so vividly acted, and so attentive to characters rather than to attending to carrying out a sports-movie formula, that I never FELT that the movie was musty or cliched. The whole thing feels fresh. It's also funny and, in the end, rather touching.MR. 3000 is basically about a selfish man's comeuppance. After getting his 3000th hit, Stan Ross (Bernie Mac) decides to rest on his laurels and retire from baseball---even as his team, the Milwaukee Brewers, is in the midst of playoff contention. Nine years later, Ross finds out that he didn't have his 3000 hits after all; a counting error caused a few hits to count more than once, and he really had only 2997 when he retired. His pride having taken a beating, he decides to return to baseball to get his final three hits...and, in the process, grows up a little from the selfish man he was in the past.It's a plot that doesn't sound all that fresh on paper. But there's no anticipating the depth that the screenwriters, director Charles Stone III, and Bernie Mac bring to the character of Stan Ross. Ross could have been made into a caricature of arrogance, a painfully funny stick figure of a character off of whom easy satirical points could have been scored. But the Ross of MR. 3000 is disarmingly likable in spite of his (hilarious) flaws, because you realize that, despite his me-first nature, he really does love the game of baseball, and understands how it works. It is with this understanding that he becomes a mentor of sorts to the new Brewers team he joins: a group of self-satisfied, self-absorbed players who seem to care little about the game itself (and their indifference is reflected in their cellar-dwelling status in their league). In one scene, Ross sees a faintly disturbing reflection of his old self in T-Rex (Brian J. White), and, as T-Rex is about to get into his car, Ross stops him and advises him on the virtues of becoming a forceful team leader, one who can encourage the highest level of play from the team. Ross has clearly seen enough to know what makes for a winning team, and that is what makes Ross an admirable character regardless of his inflated ego.But, of course, at that point of the movie, you might be thinking that he's being a little hypocritical, telling a teammate to act like a team leader when he himself hasn't shown a great deal of similar unselfish attributes. It is precisely that kind of character complexity and nuance that makes MR. 3000 stand out from the usual standard sports-movie ilk, with its comic caricatures and by-the-numbers plots. The film doesn't take a mechanical approach to Stan Ross' change of heart. When Hit No. 3000 looms on the horizon for him, Ross decides to call for an extra team practice...only to blow it off himself in order to appear on Jay Leno. He still can't resist the lure of his own ego, even as he selflessly inspires his team to try to at least go down fighting.Stan Ross is a character that has been sensitively written by its three credited writers (Eric Champnella, Keith Mitchell, and Howard Michael Gould), but of course it's up to the actor to bring a character to life, and Bernie Mac comes through with a performance that is better than anyone had a right to expect from a man whose first leading role this is. Whereas another actor might have gone for psychological depth in portraying Ross' selfishness, Mac makes it light and funny. But Mac does achieve some real moments of emotional gravitas, moments in which one can sense, looking at Mac's expressive face at certain moments, that Ross' anxiety and fear about losing his hard-fought legacy loom in his head. It's a charming, beautifully-shaded, marvelous performance, and for all the hype Jamie Foxx garnered for his Ray Charles interpretation in RAY, Bernie Mac's may actually be superior in its emotional impact. Seriously.Director Charles Stone III keeps everything light, fresh and above all honest; this movie, which could easily have given into Hollywood-style bathos, never becomes overly sentimental with its change-of-heart story. Instead, it is emotionally convincing every step of the way. Stone---as well as the script, of course---also shows an awareness of the realities of the game of baseball today: how pro athletes can sometimes be less than serious about the game they're playing, how baseball owners can sometimes be concerned only about drawing in crowds, how sensitive media members can be when a player treats them less than respectfully, etc. You can see how a focused player like Stan Ross could be considered a refreshing and even uplifting presence in the midst of such cynicism. Thankfully, the movie itself never becomes merely cynical: even as it takes some sharp jabs at baseball as it is run today, there is always that faint recognition of truth that makes for an enriching movie.By the end of MR. 3000, the movie inevitably comes down to a last-ditch effort in the bottom of the 9th inning in a tie game. And eventually Stan Ross gets redemption---but not the kind of redemption he necessarily expects. It's perhaps not as surprising an ending as the filmmakers clearly want it to be; still, it is a beautifully fitting ending, one that puts a capper on a surprisingly better-than-average sports movie. Call me sentimental, but I found MR. 3000 touching.

866791,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0006GAI5U,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[0, 0]","When I first saw the opening part of the trailer for ""Mr. 3000"" in a theater I was instantly outraged. The premise of this 2004 comedy is that baseball player Stan Ross, a self-centered superstar, retired after getting his 3000th hit and has been marketing himself as ""Mr. 3000."" However, when an error is discovered and three hits are removed from his batting record, Ross comes out of retirement to get those three hits and get back his good name. But Ross is as big of an egotistical jerk as before and his return to the game is universally assailed. The guys at ESPN and other cable sports shows have a field day with this guy in some of the best moments of the show (as a rule of thumb, everything on video is pretty funny). For that matter, one of the mascots for the team does not like him, but for a new and rather specific reason.What was upsetting me was that baseball already has somebody with exactly 3000 hits, Roberto Clemente. On the final day of the 1972 season Clemente doubled for his 3000th hit (the 11th person to make it to that mark). Clemente was removed from the game and although he went out to get hour hits in the NLCS that year, that double was the final hit of his career. Ten weeks later, when an earthquake hit Nicaragua, Clemente volunteered to carry supplies to the victims. On New Year's Eve his plane crashed into the sea and his body was never recovered. Compare Ross to Clemente and you are talking about polar extremes.However, the real problem with this film is what was set up in the second half of the trailer, and that is the idea that Stan Ross is going to become a new man in his quest for those three hits. If this is a story of redemption, then it is not an insult to the memory of Roberto Clemente (whose picture is on the wall in Stan Ross's den, but you have to look for it really quick at the extreme right edge of the frame). It is a good thing that you know the title character is going to be redeemed because the motivation for doing so is not at all clear.Those with a knowledge of baseball will realize that Stan Ross is not Roberto Clemente (or even Tony Gwynn, whom Mac looks more like in terms of body type), but rather Jim Rice. This is a guy who should be in the Hall of Fame but apparently reporters are still holding grudges against him so that he is not going to make it until the people who played with and against him are on the Veterans Committee. Rice did not have the bona fides of a Steve Carlton, who was even more hated by the press, or even of a Stan Ross, who is right about one thing: 3000 hits automatically gets you into the Hall of Fame (and on the first ballot too). But after getting his 3000 hits Ross QUITS THE GAME, with his team in a pennant race. In case you were on the fence about the guy he rips the ball away from a kid. No wonder nobody wants to talk about him when the Milwaukee Brewers finally retire his number. If anything, fans should be booing him like crazy (think Ricky Williams visiting Miami in the near future) and he should not even be within four votes of Cooperstown (if he did get into the Hall of Fame they should put that he quit in the middle of the season after he got his big hit).Even though Ross has been out of baseball for nine years, the owner of the Brewers (Chris Noth) signs him to help fill seats. Milwaukee is in 5th place and all it has to show is slugger T-Rex Pennebaker (Brian J. White), who might be even more egotistical and self-centered than Ross. But when the team he dismissed as Little Leaguers starts making bonehead plays, Ross is actually offended. Why? Did he ever care before? He must know something about the game because not all of those 2,997 hits were the result of pure talent, but it takes a while for Ross to start playing (or at least trying to play) with his head. Ross tries to play a leadership role on the squad (the running joke is that manager Paul Sorvino sits there and does not say a word for almost the entire movie, bidding his time for the right moment to finally speak), and even tries to get T-Rex to see the light.Why does T-Rex listen to Ross? Good question. Here is an even better one: why pitch around somebody who has two hits in about sixty at bats? Where the ending of ""Mr. 3000"" is such a disappointment is not only did I see it coming about five minutes before I started watching the film, but also because they lifted the key bit of the climax from another (and much, much better) baseball movie (telling you the name of the movie would ruin the ending even more so). It would have taken a little thought to come up with a variation of that so the parallel was not so blatantly obvious that it takes you out of the moment the whole film has been building to, because it does have Mac's best moment.It seems Denzel Washington was originally thinking of doing this movie and it is a good thing that he passed, because as a comedian Mac is able to make Stan Ross somewhat likeable despite what he does (Denzel would have given the role too hard of an edge and the film would never recover), and surprisingly he nails the dramatic aspects of the character as well. It also matters that Mo Simmons, an ESPN reporter played by Angela Bassett, likes Ross a lot, which carries a lot of weight with us as well. But just like what happened when Ross got his big hit at the start of the movie, the character keeps taking two steps backwards for every step forward. His momentum as a character is all going in the wrong direction, but the story keeps progressing by the numbers in the other direction and there is nothing we can do about it.Ironically the flaw in ""Mr. 3000"" is those three hits. You can get three hits in three times at bat, but that would make for a short film and this script drags it out as long as possible (so long in fact that the .314 lifetime batting average Ross is so proud of is done to .311 before the credits role). There is a major subplot regarding the Brewers trying to finish 3rd in their division and it takes place almost entirely off-camera. It has to be because except for T-Rex and Fukuda (Ian Anthony Dale), the Japanese pitcher who is always a word off on getting American curses correct, and the perpetually distracted team of Minadeo

So kudos to B-Mac, he pulled me right into his performance.The film opens as Ross gets his historical 3,000th Hit. For those that don't follow Baseball - it's a task that is so difficult that only 28 players in the 150 year history of the game have actually achieved it. And having reached that amazing mark, what does he do? Marches up to the stands and immediately begins to denigrate a little boy; snatching ""his"" historic baseball without even offering a trade or a thank you. The bleep actually acts offended the kid has the temerity to have his hands on it. He then turns around and commits one of the unholiest sins you can commit in Baseball - quitting in the middle of a pennant run. Why? Because ""he got his"".The sad part is there are players actually like that in real life. I won't mention names - Gary (cough) Sheffield - but they exist, believe it.Now, years after abandoning his team, and on the verge of getting The Call from Cooperstown - there's a hitch. Official statisticians have discovered an error. Stan Ross, baseball's Mr. 3000, is short by three hits. And the BBWAA doesn't like shortcomings, whether they're in the record books or via personal failings. Ol' Stan is now lugging around both.Coming as a shock to absolutely no one, he fails to get the necessary votes. There's no chance he'll make the HOF. It's over.Unless...Seven years out of the game getting fat and old - he convinces the team owner for one last shot to rejoin the club he abandoned, constantly criticized, and publicly humiliated. Can he once again find the magic? Will he even get the chance? Given that so much of Baseball isn't about single player achievements; rarely does one reach significant goals without help - the support you receive from teammates is critical for success.Bernie plays to the hilt the boilerplate story of an arrogant megalomaniacal jerk finally humbled and shamed into realizing he didn't reach that milestone all by his lonesome. Broken, built back up, and given a second chance for the brass ring, only to teeter on the edge of relapse. Will he finally make the right choice?I admit to being caught up in the well-worn screenplay and predictable inspiring soundtrack of rising violins and righteous trumpets as Stan finally finds redemption as player, as a teammate and as a man. Corny as all get out, but I still bought it.You know the saying you truly miss someone not when they're gone - but when you reach out and they're not there anymore?

Beusch,"[0, 0]","Bernie Mac is such an explosively funny comedian (The Bernie Mac Show, Kings of Comedy, Ocean's 11), it makes me hope that he fires his agent so he won't make any more films like Mr. 3000. This Bernie Mac film is so bad, it not only wastes Mac's talents, but also those of Angela Bassett (from What's Love Got to Do With It to this ... ugh!) and Paul Sorvino as well. It's yet another one of those hackneyed sports movies where a talented, but selfish athlete finds redemption and becomes a team player at the end. You know the drill: he's cocky, but he's all alone because he's a jerk, he doesn't appreciate the woman who loves him, he finds salvation at the end, rallies the team to a big winning streak, blah, blah, blah, blah .... The film tries to be heartwarming and inspiring, but, in the end, all the false emotional manipulation does is take away Mac's edge, leaving an unfunny and jumbled mess.Unfortunately, Bernie Mac is traveling down the same film road that Richard Pryor did. Namely, instead of using Mac's natural edginess and sharp humor to create a truly interesting, if negative, character, Mr. 3000 tries to make him softer and more sympathetic to make him palatable to mainstream audiences. The problem is that that isn't what Bernie Mac is all about. Look at Mac's performance in Kings of Comedy -- brash, very un-p.c. and very, very funny -- and contrast it with the soft, shapeless character he plays in 3000. The film doesn't have the guts to let Mac be purely nasty. And since the screenwriters didn't have the talent to believably show Mac's transformation from heel to hero, the result is a wishy-washy mess that smacks of phony emotion and manipulation. The producers should have just turned Mr. 3000 into a purely negative character a la Billy Bob Thornton in Mac's much better comedy Bad Santa and gone for the jugular instead of sanding off his rough edges and trying to get the audience to buy it.",2,Bernie Mac's Talents Wasted,1096761600,"10 3, 2004",2004,1930,"['Bernie', 'Mac', 'such', 'explosively', 'funny', 'comedian', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'Show', 'Kings', 'Comedy', 'Ocean', '11', 'hope', 'agent', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'more', 'films', 'Mr.', '3000', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'film', 'so', 'bad', 'not', 'only', 'Mac', 'talents', 'also', 'Angela', 'Bassett', 'What', 'Love', 'Got', 'Do', 'ugh', 'Paul', 'Sorvino', 'as', 'well', 'yet', 'one', 'hackneyed', 'sports', 'movies', 'where', 'talented', 'selfish', 'athlete', 'finds', 'redemption', 'team', 'player', 'end', 'know', 'drill', 'cocky', 'alone', 'jerk', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'woman', 'who', 'salvation', 'end', 'team', 'big', 'winning', 'streak', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'film', 'tries', 'be', 'heartwarming', 'inspiring', 'end', 'false', 'emotional', 'manipulation', 'take', 'away', 'Mac', 'edge', 'leaving', 'unfunny', 'jumbled', 'mess.Unfortunately', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'traveling', 'down', 'same', 'film', 'road', 'Richard', 'Pryor', 'did', 'Namely', 'instead', 'using', 'Mac', 'natural', 'edginess', 'sharp', 'humor', 'create', 'truly', 'interesting', 'negative', 'character', 'Mr.', '3000', 'make', 'softer', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'make', 'palatable', 'mainstream', 'audiences', 'problem', ""n't"", 'what', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'Look', 'Mac', 'performance', 'Kings', 'Comedy', 'brash', 'very', 'un-p.c', 'very', 'very', 'funny', 'contrast', 'soft', 'shapeless', 'character', '3000', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'guts', 'let', 'Mac', 'be', 'purely', 'nasty', 'screenwriters', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'talent', 'believably', 'show', 'Mac', 'transformation', 'heel', 'hero', 'result', 'wishy-washy', 'mess', 'smacks', 'phony', 'emotion', 'manipulation', 'producers', 'should', 'have', 'just', 'turned', 'Mr.', '3000', 'purely', 'negative', 'character', 'la', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'Mac', 'much', 'better', 'comedy', 'Bad', 'Santa', 'gone', 'jugular', 'instead', 'sanding', 'off', 'rough', 'edges', 'trying', 'get', 'audience', 'buy']",N/A

Stan Ross (Bernie Mac) is a former Milwaukee Brewer who retired from baseball as soon as he had achieved a career 3000 hits, guaranteeing him  a place in the record books and a slew of endorsement deals. His teammates hated him. The press attacked him. But egotistical, self-obsessed Stan didn't care as long as he had 3000 hits and a shot at the Baseball Hall of Fame. 9 years later, when he is finally being seriously considered for entry into the Hall of Fame, a computational error that caused 3 of his hits to be counted twice is discovered. Stan only made 2997 hits! So he decides to return to baseball, at the age of 47, to get those 3 hits back. He finds that a lot of things have changed since he left the game. But his former love, sports journalist Maureen Simmons (Angela Bassett), is covering his story again. And the team's young, cocky, selfish, star player (Brian White) reminds Stan of himself.Bernie Mac injects a little bite into this otherwise feel-good comedy. Stan Ross is obnoxious, but Mac makes him a basically lovable jerk. If you don't like Bernie Mac's persona, however, you won't like this. Stan is overbearing, but ""Mr. 3000"" is ultimately a sweet film about self-sacrifice with the occasional off-color comment to remind us that we are talking about professional athletes here. It's a fun movie if you're looking for something light.The DVD: Bonus features include 3 featurettes, 3 extended sequences, 3 deleted scenes with optional director's commentary, outtakes (3 minutes), and an audio commentary by director Charles Stone III. ""The Making of Mr. 3000"" (15 minutes) features interviews with producer Maggie White, director Charles Stone, the principle cast, and the film's baseball advisor and baseball coordinator.  Stone discusses his intentions and the sports shows featured in the film. The cast talk about their experiences with baseball and with training for the film. ""Spring Training: The Extras' Journey"" (10 minutes) follows the process of finding the extras to play baseball roles, some of whom were talented players drafted by pro teams in the past. Includes interviews with some of the extras. ""Everybody Loves Stan"" (3 1/2 minutes) is a sort of mock media production about the Stan Ross character using footage from the movie and a few soundbites from former pro baseball players. Charles Stone does a nice director's commentary that addresses technical, character, narrative, and thematic aspects of the film, clearly and coherently. Subtitles for the film are available in French and Spanish. Captioning is in English.

It won't replace Major League or Bull Durham as funny, baseball movie classics, but it holds it own as a cute, and comedic baseball movie.  MAC plays an all-world, all everything baseball player, who's game is off the charts, and ego is even more off the charts (reminds me a lot of Barry Bonds), trying to get his 3000th hit (for any baseball fan, that's the ultimate pinnacle in a major leaguer's career to achieve) so he can retire and be elected to the hall of fame.  After obtaining the milestone he quits the team during the middle of a pennant race, amongst team, fan and media disgust alike.  After missing out on the hall of fame by a few votes thanks to his alienation of the media, he learns that three of his hits were taken away due to cancellation of a game he played some years ago.  Now some 9 years after retirement, Mac's character is determined to come back and get that record while the owner is looking just to fill the seats and make money.  Like any other athlete who's retired for several years and tried to come back, Mac, realizes that not only has the game changed, but the approach to the game has changed as well as his skills have dramatically changed as well after 9 years.  This is when the fun really begins.  Angela Bassett plays an ESPN sideline reporter covering his comeback and also plays a former flame (This woman is still absolutely gorgeous, and still underutilized in her roles, whew!).  Some of the funniest moments are the live shots of MAC appearing with Jay Leno and watching them go back and forth at it, Stuart Scott basically lambasting Mac's return to the game, and of course watching Tom Arnold and MAC trade barbs was classic.  It was still entertaining enough to make me laugh throughout and the director let MAC use his comedic genius to perfection.  It was nice to know that some of the extras used as players on other teams were actually minor leaguers that I recognized on other teams' organizations.

866805,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0006GAI5U,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 1]","""Mr. 3000"" is a fitfully amusing sports comedy that touches on the same comeback theme we encountered in ""The Rookie"" several years back.  Bernie Mac plays Stan, an arrogant son-of-a-bitch center fielder on the Milwaukee Brewers whose claim to fame (in 1995, when the movie opens), is that he is fast approaching the magic 3,000 mark for career hits.  On the day in which he achieves his goal, Stan literally takes his ball and goes home, leaving his fellow team members in the lurch in midseason.  Fast forward nine years to find Stan still as obnoxious as ever, bragging about his past glory and whining because the powers-that-be have yet to vote him into the Baseball Hall of Fame.  He`s even managed to parlay his record into a successful business career, opening up a strip mall filled with stores bearing his signature epithet ""3000.""  Stan gets the shock of his life when he is informed that the original triple thousand number was actually a miscount and that he managed to score only 2,997 hits in his career, not 3000.  Stan, thus, decides to return to the ball field just long enough for him to set the record straight and keep his title of Mr. 3000.  And before you know it, it's the final game of the season, the bottom of the ninth and Stan is still stuck at 2,999 hits; he steps up to the plate, swings at the pitch, and ........Oh well, I guess I should leave you with SOMETHING to be surprised about.  Suffice it to say that Stan's world class ego takes some pretty tough lickings before he comes to learn the age old lesson that it is teamwork and ""how you play the game"" that really counts.""Mr. 3000"" is a benign little fantasy that catches you up in its story even though you know all along where it is heading and how shamelessly it is manipulating you.  Much of its charm comes from Mac's shrewd, high-spirited performance and the clever way in which both he and the script satirize the rampant egotism that is so prominent in professional athletics these days.  Since ""Mr. 3000"" is both a ""comeback"" and a ""redemption"" tale set in the world of America`s Favorite Pastime, one would naturally assume that the movie would be specifically designed with youngsters in mind.  However, I`m not sure that`s the case, for the script employs a surprising amount of crudity and profanity - appropriate to the diamond and the dugout, perhaps, but not necessarily to a family-friendly movie.Still, this is a lighthearted little film that doesn't take itself too seriously and provides just enough laughs to make you feel you aren't wasting your time or your hard earned money.",3,decent little comedy,1117238400,"05 28, 2005",2005,2588,"['Mr.', '3000', 'fitfully', 'amusing', 'sports', 'comedy', 'same', 'comeback', 'theme', 'encountered', 'Rookie', 'several', 'years', 'back', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'Stan', 'arrogant', 'son-of-a-bitch', 'center', 'fielder', 'Milwaukee', 'Brewers', 'claim', 'fame', '1995', 'when', 'movie', 'fast', 'approaching', 'magic', '3,000', 'mark', 'career', 'hits', 'day', 'goal', 'Stan', 'literally', 'ball', 'home', 'leaving', 'fellow', 'team', 'members', 'lurch', 'midseason', 'Fast', 'forward', 'nine', 'years', 'find', 'Stan', 'still', 'as', 'obnoxious', 'ever', 'bragging', 'past', 'glory', 'whining', 'powers-that-be', 'have', 'yet', 'vote', 'Baseball', 'Hall', 'Fame', 's', 'even', 'managed', 'parlay', 'record', 'successful', 'business', 'career', 'opening', 'up', 'strip', 'mall', 'filled', 'stores', 'bearing', 'signature', '3000', 'Stan', 'shock', 'life', 'when', 'informed', 'original', 'triple', 'thousand', 'number', 'was', 'actually', 'miscount', 'managed', 'score', 'only', '2,997', 'hits', 'career', 'not', '3000', 'Stan', 'thus', 'return', 'ball', 'field', 'just', 'long', 'enough', 'set', 'record', 'straight', 'keep', 'title', 'Mr.', '3000', 'know', 'final', 'game', 'season', 'bottom', 'ninth', 'Stan', 'still', 'stuck', '2,999', 'hits', 'up', 'plate', 'swings', 'pitch', '..Oh', 'well', 'guess', 'should', 'leave', 'SOMETHING', 'be', 'surprised', 'Suffice', 'say', 'Stan', 'world', 'class', 'ego', 'pretty', 'tough', 'lickings', 'learn', 'age', 'old', 'lesson', 'teamwork', 'how', 'play', 'game', 'really', 'counts.', 'Mr', '3000', 'benign', 'little', 'fantasy', 'catches', 'up', 'story', 'even', 'know', 'where', 'heading', 'how', 'shamelessly', 'manipulating', 'Much', 'charm', 'Mac', 'shrewd', 'high-spirited', 'performance', 'clever', 'way', 'script', 'satirize', 'rampant', 'egotism', 'so', 'prominent', 'professional', 'athletics', 'days', 'Mr.', '3000', 'comeback', 'redemption', 'tale', 'set', 'world', 'America', 's', 'Favorite', 'Pastime', 'one', 'would', 'naturally', 'assume', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'specifically', 'designed', 'youngsters', 'mind', 'However', 'm', 'not', 'sure', 's', 'case', 'script', 'surprising', 'amount', 'crudity', 'profanity', 'appropriate', 'diamond', 'dugout', 'perhaps', 'not', 'necessarily', 'family-friendly', 'movie.Still', 'lighthearted', 'little', 'film', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'just', 'enough', 'make', 'feel', 'are', ""n't"", 'wasting', 'time', 'hard', 'earned', 'money']",N/A

His retirement couldn't have been more politically incorrect and he swings a few hits aimed below the belt at the exact people he will come to need in the end. Finding the life of a retired ball-player not what it is cracked up to be he decides to return to the game to correct his faulty hit record. His return sparks a flame with an old love, reporter Mo (Angela Bassett), and he has to reach far beyond his seventh inning stretch to keep in her good graces. He only needs 3 hits but will his body, mind and attitude cooperate....its a new game in town.Bernie Mac deserves a better role although he does his best to pull this badly written part off. His best scenes involve a modern workout regime!
