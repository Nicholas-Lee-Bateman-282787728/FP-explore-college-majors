1444722,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B0057I5T10,Eric Sanberg,"[2, 2]","Whoda thunk ""Groundhog Day"" would have spawned so many wannabes? I suppose, like 'found footage' movies, it's become a genre unto itself. This is an Okay entry.Here's the scoop. You meet three friends in drug rehab one morning, during breakfast, in the facility's dining hall. They are at a point in their rehab where they need to find the people they'd hurt the most in their dark days and make amends. Things don't go well for any of them. Later that night all three receive electric shocks during a storm. They awake the next day to realize it's a repeat of the previous day. Now they explore each day with little regard to their actions knowing it will all wash away. This works for a bit but their individual personalities begin to divide them as to how to use this time and even get out. Therein lies the rub.This is a steady but somehow lacking film. I guess it bothered me that people who are trying so hard to straighten out their lives would so quickly revert backward when the idea of consequence is removed. The one of the group, Weeks (looking disturbingly like a young Robert DeNiro), is a real prize. Drugs were fine before. Now murder and torture are A-Okay in his book. The other two, Kyle and Sonia, after a slight back-sliding, get to realize the gravity of the situation and go to lengths to both set things right and hopefully get back on the calendar. Things move logically enough but it effected my brain more than my heart. It needed something in the script to become more involving.There was nothing really bad here. It was acted, shot and directed well enough. I just kind of shrugged my shoulders when it was all over. Not at all a bad watch. Just needed a bit more something to put it over the top.",3,"""Groundhog Day"" with Druggies",1372291200,"06 27, 2013",2013,1726,"['Whoda', 'thunk', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'would', 'have', 'spawned', 'so', 'many', 'wannabes', 'suppose', 'footage', 'movies', 'become', 'genre', 'Okay', 'scoop', 'meet', 'three', 'friends', 'drug', 'rehab', 'one', 'morning', 'breakfast', 'facility', 'dining', 'hall', 'are', 'point', 'rehab', 'where', 'need', 'find', 'people', ""'d"", 'hurt', 'most', 'dark', 'days', 'make', 'amends', 'Things', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'well', 'Later', 'night', 'three', 'receive', 'electric', 'shocks', 'storm', 'awake', 'next', 'day', 'realize', 'repeat', 'previous', 'day', 'Now', 'explore', 'day', 'little', 'regard', 'actions', 'knowing', 'will', 'wash', 'away', 'bit', 'individual', 'personalities', 'begin', 'divide', 'how', 'use', 'time', 'even', 'get', 'out', 'Therein', 'rub.This', 'steady', 'somehow', 'lacking', 'film', 'guess', 'bothered', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'trying', 'so', 'hard', 'straighten', 'out', 'lives', 'would', 'so', 'quickly', 'revert', 'backward', 'when', 'idea', 'consequence', 'removed', 'one', 'group', 'Weeks', 'looking', 'disturbingly', 'young', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'real', 'prize', 'Drugs', 'were', 'fine', 'Now', 'murder', 'torture', 'are', 'A-Okay', 'book', 'other', 'two', 'Kyle', 'Sonia', 'slight', 'back-sliding', 'get', 'realize', 'gravity', 'situation', 'go', 'lengths', 'set', 'things', 'right', 'hopefully', 'get', 'back', 'calendar', 'Things', 'move', 'logically', 'enough', 'effected', 'brain', 'more', 'heart', 'needed', 'something', 'script', 'become', 'more', 'involving.There', 'was', 'nothing', 'really', 'bad', 'here', 'was', 'acted', 'shot', 'directed', 'well', 'enough', 'just', 'kind', 'shrugged', 'shoulders', 'when', 'was', 'over', 'Not', 'bad', 'watch', 'Just', 'needed', 'bit', 'more', 'something', 'put', 'top']",Repeaters

1444724,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0057I5T10,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 3]","Repeaters (Carl Bessai, 2010)The whole time I was watching Repeaters, though it did not detract from my enjoyment of the film, I kept wondering why Carl Bessai's name sounded familiar. After the movie, I pulled him up on IMDB and found I'd seen one of his movies previously--Severed: Forest of the Dead, which was a good deal more enjoyable than it had any right to be. The same could be said of Repeaters.Plot: we open in a rehab clinic, with the usual assortment of idiots, jerks, and the occasional decent person who went wrong. Three of the non-jerks, Kyle Halsted (Slither's Dustin Milligan), Sonia Logan (The Haunting in Connecticut's Amanda Crew), and Michael Weeks (Crossed's Richard de Klerk), have formed a loose bond against the jerk contingent. In the opening sequences, we see everyone in group, and group leader Bob (Benjamin Ratner, returning from Severed) instructs his charges that today is the day they will go out in to the world, find the person they feel they most hurt with their addictions, and beg forgiveness. (Depending on to whom you talk, that's either step eight or step nine.) The day goes just about as you expect. Kyle attempts to connect with his younger sister Charlotte (Fido's Alexia Fast), gets blown off, and is told by his former high school principal to get off the grounds or the cops will be called. Michael heads for jail to see his father (Watchmen's John Tench), and it's good there's plexiglass between them. Sonia, too, goes to see her dying father (The Core's Hrothgar Matthews), and while it's a bust, it's still the most successful of the three. They go back to rehab, share their experiences, etc. That night, there's a nasty electrical storm, and all three of our principals are shocked through various agents. When they wake up the next morning...it's not the next morning. It's Wednesday again, and the three of them soon realize that they are reliving the same day over... and over... and over..., and soon they begin exploring the implications.Yes, I know exactly what you're thinking right now, in that horrible Lifetime Original Movie way. I was thinking the same thing while I was watching it, and was actually half-prepared to give the movie a rotten review based on my being almost certain it was going to go in that direction. It is a credit to Bessai, as well as a testament to how much he grew as a filmmaker in the four years between Severed and Repeaters, that yes, the movie does go in that direction at the end (sorry for the spoiler!), but by that time, Bessai and screenwriter Arne Olsen (All Dogs Go to Heaven 2) have loaded the climax with so much of these three characters' personal baggage that going in that direction not only makes perfect sense but almost--almost!--doesn't feel like the crappy, overwrought clich&eacute; that it is. I'll put it this way, it's not Lifetime Original Movie, it's at least ABC Movie of the Week back when ABC Movie of the Week actually meant something. Olsen obviously spent a great deal of time thinking about the implications; I certainly can't say I've seen every Groundhog Day-style movie out there, but so many of them play the situation for comic relief that the darker side rarely gets any play. Olsen worked that vein as hard as he could, and he did it well. This isn't timeless cinema by any means; no one here is a great actor, though all are competent, and Bessai is a fine genre director, but no one will be mistaking him for Bela Tarr or Werner Herzog anytime soon. But if you're looking for a slick, well-written, satisfying genre flick, you probably overlooked Repeaters the first time around. You should give it a look now. ***",3,"Another solid, if unspectacular, Carl Bessai movie.",1362528000,"03 6, 2013",2013,3651,"['Repeaters', 'Carl', 'Bessai', '2010', 'whole', 'time', 'was', 'watching', 'Repeaters', 'did', 'not', 'detract', 'enjoyment', 'film', 'kept', 'wondering', 'why', 'Carl', 'Bessai', 'name', 'sounded', 'familiar', 'movie', 'pulled', 'up', 'IMDB', 'found', ""'d"", 'seen', 'one', 'movies', 'previously', 'Severed', 'Forest', 'Dead', 'was', 'good', 'deal', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'had', 'right', 'be', 'same', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'Repeaters.Plot', 'open', 'rehab', 'clinic', 'usual', 'assortment', 'idiots', 'jerks', 'occasional', 'decent', 'person', 'who', 'went', 'wrong', 'Three', 'non-jerks', 'Kyle', 'Halsted', 'Slither', 'Dustin', 'Milligan', 'Sonia', 'Logan', 'Haunting', 'Connecticut', 'Amanda', 'Crew', 'Michael', 'Weeks', 'Crossed', 'Richard', 'de', 'Klerk', 'have', 'formed', 'loose', 'bond', 'jerk', 'contingent', 'opening', 'sequences', 'see', 'everyone', 'group', 'group', 'leader', 'Bob', 'Benjamin', 'Ratner', 'returning', 'Severed', 'charges', 'today', 'day', 'will', 'go', 'out', 'world', 'find', 'person', 'feel', 'most', 'hurt', 'addictions', 'beg', 'forgiveness', 'Depending', 'whom', 'talk', 'step', 'eight', 'step', 'nine', 'day', 'just', 'about', 'expect', 'Kyle', 'connect', 'younger', 'sister', 'Charlotte', 'Fido', 'Alexia', 'Fast', 'blown', 'off', 'told', 'former', 'high', 'school', 'principal', 'get', 'off', 'grounds', 'cops', 'will', 'be', 'called', 'Michael', 'heads', 'jail', 'see', 'father', 'Watchmen', 'John', 'Tench', 'good', 'plexiglass', 'Sonia', 'too', 'see', 'dying', 'father', 'Core', 'Hrothgar', 'Matthews', 'bust', 'still', 'most', 'successful', 'three', 'go', 'back', 'rehab', 'share', 'experiences', 'etc', 'night', 'nasty', 'electrical', 'storm', 'three', 'principals', 'are', 'shocked', 'various', 'agents', 'When', 'wake', 'up', 'next', 'morning', 'not', 'next', 'morning', 'Wednesday', 'again', 'three', 'soon', 'realize', 'are', 'reliving', 'same', 'day', 'soon', 'begin', 'exploring', 'implications.Yes', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', ""'re"", 'thinking', 'right', 'now', 'horrible', 'Lifetime', 'Original', 'Movie', 'way', 'was', 'thinking', 'same', 'thing', 'was', 'watching', 'was', 'actually', 'half-prepared', 'give', 'movie', 'rotten', 'review', 'based', 'being', 'almost', 'certain', 'was', 'going', 'go', 'direction', 'credit', 'Bessai', 'as', 'well', 'testament', 'how', 'much', 'grew', 'filmmaker', 'four', 'years', 'Severed', 'Repeaters', 'yes', 'movie', 'go', 'direction', 'end', 'sorry', 'spoiler', 'time', 'Bessai', 'screenwriter', 'Arne', 'Olsen', 'All', 'Dogs', 'Go', 'Heaven', '2', 'have', 'loaded', 'climax', 'so', 'much', 'three', 'characters', 'personal', 'baggage', 'going', 'direction', 'not', 'only', 'perfect', 'sense', 'almost', 'almost', ""n't"", 'feel', 'crappy', 'overwrought', 'clich', 'eacute', ""'ll"", 'put', 'way', 'not', 'Lifetime', 'Original', 'Movie', 'least', 'ABC', 'Movie', 'Week', 'back', 'when', 'ABC', 'Movie', 'Week', 'actually', 'meant', 'something', 'Olsen', 'obviously', 'spent', 'great', 'deal', 'time', 'thinking', 'implications', 'certainly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Groundhog', 'Day-style', 'movie', 'there', 'so', 'many', 'play', 'situation', 'comic', 'relief', 'darker', 'side', 'rarely', 'play', 'Olsen', 'worked', 'vein', 'as', 'hard', 'could', 'did', 'well', ""n't"", 'timeless', 'cinema', 'means', 'one', 'here', 'great', 'actor', 'are', 'competent', 'Bessai', 'fine', 'genre', 'director', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'mistaking', 'Bela', 'Tarr', 'Werner', 'Herzog', 'anytime', 'soon', ""'re"", 'looking', 'slick', 'well-written', 'satisfying', 'genre', 'flick', 'probably', 'overlooked', 'Repeaters', 'first', 'time', 'around', 'should', 'give', 'look', 'now', '***']",Repeaters

However this never bothers me and I found it very different, creative, and all-in-all, just a wonderful flick.It's about three kids in their twenties, who are fed up with society and are disgusted at having been forced into a drug abuse rehab center in ""Mission"", British Columbia.  Strangely, they awake one day to find they are re-living the same day as before, and this happens over and over.Two of them begin to learn, however, how important it is to make every day and moment of our lives count -- and for the better.  The third friend uses his ""gift"" of ""repeats"" (repeating days) to terrorize and harm others, and take enjoyment in it.  At one point, he even forces another of the friends to kill someone, all to find out the next day, that nothing had actually been changed.  All the while, we see that there is change -- and dramatic change -- within each of the three friends.SPOLER ALERT!I found it commical or interesting, how, in the last few frames of the movie, that Kyle and Sonia apparently were not forced to repeat their day again (apparently they had learned their lesson (I surmize this because it is always repeating from the point of view of Kyle, but then of Mike)) and Mike Weeks wakes up to find he is repeating the day AFTER the repeating day, the day in which he held Kyle and his family at gunpoint and shot himself.Interesting also to note that Richard de Klerk, who plays Mike Weeks, is also a producer and owns his own company.  Such a young person to be so accomplished.I'm also disappointed, however, to find out that this movie is out of print and so hard to get on the US Amazon.  And if you do ""get"", then you give out a lot!  There are only two copies I see on Amazon and they are for $27.22 and $52.98 respectively!  I'll check out Amazon.ca.  Just finished.

I'd never heard of the film, the cast, or the Director, and in fact, this movie isn't even available in the U.S. I saw it as one of my suggestions on Netflix streaming and figured, what do I have to lose? What I found was on of the smartest, most original stories in years. Repeaters isn't just a weird science fiction movie or a drama about addiction, it's both, and it's a whole lot more. Fusing elements of action, drama, and science fiction, Repeaters will have you on the edge of seat craving for more. Words can not express how well written this film was and how it will give you a full range of emotion in just ninety minutes. As for the cast, I'd never heard of any of them, but they were terrific, especially Richard de Klerk, who played the most deranged member of their little group.
