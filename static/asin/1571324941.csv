185717,A18KHGM44IZMEW,1571324941,Baaybeegirl,"[0, 0]",Got this for my 2 yr old becuz she LOVES nursery rhymes. I was a little dissapointed with all the dialogue and skits that preceeded the actual singing of the rhymes because she doesn't seem interested during those times. But the parts of the DVD that was just singing were pretty good. I guess it's for older kids.,3,Good DVD if you like Barney,1346198400,"08 29, 2012",2012,314,"['Got', '2', 'yr', 'old', 'becuz', 'LOVES', 'nursery', 'was', 'little', 'dissapointed', 'dialogue', 'skits', 'preceeded', 'actual', 'singing', 'rhymes', ""n't"", 'seem', 'interested', 'times', 'parts', 'DVD', 'was', 'just', 'singing', 'were', 'pretty', 'good', 'guess', 'older', 'kids']",N/A
185718,A1DQ3KRA6AD4KI,1571324941,erica2,"[1, 1]","This DVD is a total delight. Though snappy and upbeat, it actually depicts a child having a problem, and solving that problem through empathic adult guidance and the support of her peers. I say ""actually"" because the other popular Barney DVD about playing school depicts a near-perfect world in which everyone is unceasingly happy except, for a brief moment, Baby Bop. In addition to the original Barney music, which, in this production, is particularly good, the DVD contains scores of Mother Goose rhymes, usually put to music and adorably acted out i.e Mary Had A Little Lamb. Also, the woman who plays Mother Goose is superb: I just wish they'd put her name on the DVD box! The bottom line is that this is a great DVD for young children esp. those interested in/attracted to rhyming. Our two year old sat through the entire DVD: a first for him, as he usually tires after 15 or 20 minutes at the most.",5,a total delight,1206662400,"03 28, 2008",2008,905,"['DVD', 'total', 'delight', 'snappy', 'upbeat', 'actually', 'child', 'having', 'problem', 'solving', 'problem', 'empathic', 'adult', 'guidance', 'support', 'peers', 'say', 'actually', 'other', 'popular', 'Barney', 'DVD', 'playing', 'school', 'near-perfect', 'world', 'everyone', 'unceasingly', 'happy', 'brief', 'moment', 'Baby', 'Bop', 'addition', 'original', 'Barney', 'music', 'production', 'particularly', 'good', 'DVD', 'scores', 'Mother', 'Goose', 'rhymes', 'usually', 'put', 'music', 'adorably', 'acted', 'out', 'i.e', 'Mary', 'Had', 'Little', 'Lamb', 'Also', 'woman', 'who', 'Mother', 'Goose', 'superb', 'just', 'wish', ""'d"", 'put', 'name', 'DVD', 'box', 'bottom', 'line', 'great', 'DVD', 'young', 'children', 'esp', 'interested', 'in/attracted', 'rhyming', 'two', 'year', 'old', 'sat', 'entire', 'DVD', 'first', 'usually', '15', '20', 'minutes', 'most']",N/A
