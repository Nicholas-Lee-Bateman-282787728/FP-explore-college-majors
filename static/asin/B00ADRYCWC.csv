They do this with computers after filming.  At one point it was considered cool, but now that everyone is on to it it just looks stupid.  People will look at this movie in a few years and find it ridiculously dated looking.Next is the shaky camera.  At points during the movie you might be getting into it, finding yourself immersed in the story and trying to understand the characters.  Sorry, then you'll be distracted by the neverending wobbling of the camera.  It's like they paid a cameraman to drink a Super Big Gulp and film the entire thing handheld with a full bladder.

1607710,A15T487HNTIOF7,B00ADRYCWC,Deborah S. Hall,"[2, 2]","Like others, I found this movie to be better than I had anticipated.  You get a couple of convincing and well developed characters in Celeste and Jesse, and some of the secondary characters such as Jesse's best guy friend are also given some good lines.I felt that Celeste's motives for ending the marriage were very clear.  Unlike others who were so dissapointed that they did not stay together, I thought it was inevitable that they would not.  On the contrary, found myself wondering how they had decided to get married in the face of such overwhelming evidence of the differences in their priorities and temperaments.  Yes they had been best friends since high school, but seriously, do we marry our best friends from high school?While both experienced a great deal of emotional distress, both emerged in a far better place.  Jesse is with someone who loves and appreciates him without wishing he would change, and, he feels that for this woman, he really does want to strive to make things work.  Celeste comes to understand what she has lost, and becomes a bit more expansive in her ability to tolerate if not accept the imperfections and foibles of friends and strangers alike.  Along the way she meets someone with whom you feel she might eventually be far happier than she was with Jesse.  I find it interesting that so many other viewers were disappointed that Jesse and Celeste move on with their lives when you have been shown that they have both grown and have both connected with new partners with whom they can have mutually appreciative and respectful relationships.Rashida Jones did a great job with the script, bringing these characters to life, giving them convincing psychological depth (though some of the Jesse/Celeste shared antics were cloying beyond belief).  As an actress she  reminded me not a little of Meg Ryan, who, it must be said, did the cute sheepish grin/big eyes thing much better.

Amith (kndy),"[0, 0]","What happens when you marry your best friend, the only person that you have a lot in common with but then you separate with that person but yet remain very close, as if you were still a couple?  But that relationship starts to drift away as each find a new person to be with?This is the basis for ""Celeste and Jesse Forever"", a comedy/drama written by two friends, actress Rashida Jones (""Parks and Recreation"", ""The Office"", ""I Love You, Man"", ""The Social Network"") and actor Will McCormack (""Boiler Room"", ""Elf"", ""American Outlaws"") and directed by Lee Toland Krieger (""The Vicious Kind"", ""December Ends"").The film would star both Jones and McCormack but also star Andy Samberg (""That's My Boy"", ""Hot Rod"", ""Saturday Night Live""), Elijah Wood (""The Lord of the Rings"" films, ""Green Street Hooligans"", ""Eternal Sunshin of the Spotless Mind""), Ari Graynor (""Mystic River"", ""Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist""), Eric Christian Olsen (""The Thing"", ""The Hot Chick"", ""Not Another Teen Movie"") and Emma Roberts (""Hotel for Dogs"", ""Nancy Drew"", ""Wild Child"").The film would receive rave reviews from critics and also earning a nomination for Rashida Jones and Will McCormack for ""Best First Screenplay"" at the 2013 Independent Spirit Award.VIDEO:""Celeste and Jesse Forever"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1 aspect ratio).  Picture quality is fantastic for this film.  Closeups of characters, closeup of clothing, you can see the textures and the detail quite well.  The picture quality presents a natural quality to the overall film, black levels are nice and deep and for the most part, the film looks great on Blu-ray!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Celeste and Jesse Forever"" benefits from the film's English 5.1 DTS-HD MA lossless soundtrack in terms of music.  Quite often the characters are at a club or at a party and music is presented.  There are some ambiance during areas with crowds but for the most part, as one can expect from a romantic comedy, dialogue is crystal clear and in this case, an active soundtrack during the more music-driven scenes.Subtitles are in English, English SDH and French.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Celeste and Jesse Forever"" come with the following special features:Audio Commentary 1 - Featuring a fun and crazy audio commentary between Rashida Jones and Andy Samberg.Audio Commentary 2 - Featuring a commentary on the creative process of the film courtesy of co-writers and talent Rashida Jones, Will McCormack with director Lee Toland Krieger.The Making of Celeste & Jesse Forever - (13:51) The cast and crew are interviewed about their characters.  Director Lee Toland Krieger discusses the film, while Rashida Jones and Will McCormack discuss the screenwriting process of the film.On the Red Carpet: Premiere and Q&A; - (14:08) Featuring the Q&A; with director Lee Toland Krieger, co-writers Rashida Jones and Will McCormack and the main talent of ""Celeste and Jesse Forever"" at the LA Film Fes.Chris Pine Outtakes - (1:13) Chris Pine has a cameo as bearded druggie in the film and these are the outtakes.Deleted Scenes - (2:57) Featuring three deleted scenes ""I Guess I'm Getting It"", ""Can I Show You Something?"" and ""Do Any of You Have Any Jobs?"".Trailer - (2:13) The theatrical trailer for ""Celeste and Jesse Forever"".JUDGMENT CALL:Once in a while, you watch a romantic comedy that distinguishes itself from rom-com's.  In the case of ""Celeste and Jesse Forever"", co-writers Rashida Jones and Will McCormack take on the storyline of relationships that were meant to be, find your soul mate but yet due to circumstances, a (wrong) decision was made and now there is regret.""Celeste and Jesse Forever"" will be sure to tug on those who have experienced heartbreak and regret.  I don't know how many times I have heard many couples breaking up or divorcing because of status or financial status.  you often hear about how some find it difficult to be in a relationship when the woman is the breadwinner and the man, is not.In the case of this film, Celeste is the owner of a company, a driven woman who is great at what she does.  But the problem is that Jesse wanted a family, he wanted more from the relationship but unfortunately he was unemployed.And while these two are best friends, they have the same mannerisms, they enjoy the same entertainment and jokes and literally are in sync with each other, for Celeste, she was so used to having Jesse around her, no matter what.  He lived behind her, if she calls him, he's always there.But because they are separated and are divorcing, he has now tried the dating circuit and met someone and also has gotten her pregnant.And for this business woman who had lived her life quite well, is starting to realize while she gave so much to her business and professional status, she really never gave so much to her relationship and that one person that she did love and was her best friend, she is now losing her soulmate.Actually for both Celeste and Jesse, they know that they are each other's soulmate but because of their divorce and now that he wants to raise a family with his new girlfriend, despite being in love with each other, they know it's too late to go back.While I enjoyed the film, especially when it focused on Celeste and Jesse, there were some times through the film that other side characters didn't make so much sense and I was actually turned off by it.Jesse's good friend Skillz is a druggie that somehow becomes Celeste's good friend during her time of need.  Getting her high and seeing her go from this strong individual to this mess that starts getting drunk smoking weed or drinking alcohol, I just didn't think she had to fall that far down, nor did the writers have to go there just to get a point out of how miserable she is.While the scenes of Celeste and Jesse doing stroking jokes with lip balm or food, to show how both have an awkward style of humor, although I didn't care much for it, I actually was expecting it, considering comedian Andy Samberg was in the film.As for the Blu-ray release, picture quality is fantastic and because the number of club tracks or party tracks featured in the film, music is also brings a lot of bass to the lossless soundtrack of ""Celeste and Jesse Forever"".  As for special features, you get a good number of special features especially two different kind of audio commentaries which was cool.  And also a Q&A; that was held at the LA Film Fes which was a great addition to this Blu-ray release and other special features included as well.Overall, ""Celeste and Jesse Forever"" is an entertaining romantic comedy about love, marriage, divorce and regret.  But it's a different type of romantic comedy that is fresh and different from what one will usually see in a film.  While most romantic comedies tend to focus on falling in love and finding that one true soulmate, ""Celeste and Jesse Forever"" is about a divorced couple who realized they were true soulmates but unfortunately, drifted apart and realized that they actually had something quite special, a little too late.""Celeste and Jesse Forever"" is recommended!",4,"""Celeste and Jesse Forever"" is an

1607714,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00ADRYCWC,Ed Uyeshima,"[6, 8]","One thing this serious-minded 2012 romantic comedy does is prove that Rashida Jones (Parks & Recreation,The Social Network) can carry a film. Like Debra Winger and Holly Hunter before her, she's one of those actresses who comes across as a little too smart for the room but still elicits affection when she allows herself to reveal her vulnerability. This must also be the way she sees herself since she co-wrote the screenplay with featured player Will McCormack (the stoner pal of Andy Samberg's character) and is in almost every scene of this movie. Fortunately it doesn't come across as a self-serving act of megalomania despite the character she plays. She's a type-A career woman, a celebrity trend-spotter who compulsively controls all her impulses, while Samberg plays a slacker graphic artist who's fine with not working for long stretches and repeatedly watches videos of the weightlifting competition from the 2008 Beijing Olympics for inspiration.Directed with a surprisingly deft hand by Lee Toland Krieger (The Vicious Kind), the movie focuses on how these two characters, married but separated, remain an absurdly compatible couple whose failed attempt at marriage initially seems quite dumbfounding. They both contend they can divorce but remain best friends, an assertion that appalls best friends Beth and Tucker who are about to get married and can't understand why they won't move on with their lives. That's the simple premise, and the rest of the story deals with what happens when one starts to get serious about someone else and how neither is prepared for what it will do to their relationship. Their stop-start confusion is palpably played out amid a cool but lived-in LA that feels like an appropriate setting for this familiar story. Jones has Celeste carry most of the emotional burden, and she lends genuine likability to a character that could have otherwise been downright insufferable, which is a constant source of humor in the clever script.Samberg is good in his first serious role although he sometimes seems too recessive to counterbalance Jones' energetic presence. Emma Roberts (Julia's niece,Valentine's Day) plays Celeste's petulant Lady Gaga-wannabe pop star client Riley Banks with fervor and brings a nice edge to her scenes with Jones, while Elijah Wood has coiled fun playing Celeste's uptight gay business partner. Ari Graynor (Conviction) and Eric Christian Olsen effectively play Beth and Tucker to their accustomed stereotypes. Chris Messina shows up yet again in a prominent supporting role, this time as Celeste's acerbic patient suitor in waiting. There are moments, scenes even, where I felt the movie was a little too satisfied with itself, but it usually recovers with amusing twists on conventional romcom situations mostly involving Celeste's inability to accept the inevitable. That, of course, places the pressure on Jones to deliver the goods as both star and screenwriter, both of which she handles quite well here.",4,An Inventive Romcom about Setting Someone Free,1354752000,"12 6, 2012",2012,2978,"['One', 'thing', 'serious-minded', '2012', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'prove', 'Rashida', 'Jones', 'Parks', 'Recreation', 'Social', 'Network', 'can', 'carry', 'film', 'Debra', 'Winger', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'one', 'actresses', 'who', 'across', 'little', 'too', 'smart', 'room', 'still', 'affection', 'when', 'reveal', 'vulnerability', 'must', 'also', 'be', 'way', 'co-wrote', 'screenplay', 'featured', 'player', 'Will', 'McCormack', 'stoner', 'pal', 'Andy', 'Samberg', 'character', 'almost', 'scene', 'movie', 'Fortunately', ""n't"", 'come', 'self-serving', 'act', 'megalomania', 'character', 'type-A', 'career', 'woman', 'celebrity', 'trend-spotter', 'who', 'compulsively', 'impulses', 'Samberg', 'slacker', 'graphic', 'artist', 'who', 'fine', 'not', 'working', 'long', 'stretches', 'repeatedly', 'watches', 'videos', 'weightlifting', 'competition', '2008', 'Beijing', 'Olympics', 'inspiration.Directed', 'surprisingly', 'deft', 'hand', 'Lee', 'Toland', 'Krieger', 'Vicious', 'Kind', 'movie', 'how', 'two', 'characters', 'married', 'separated', 'remain', 'absurdly', 'compatible', 'couple', 'failed', 'attempt', 'marriage', 'initially', 'quite', 'dumbfounding', 'contend', 'can', 'divorce', 'remain', 'best', 'friends', 'assertion', 'best', 'friends', 'Beth', 'Tucker', 'who', 'are', 'get', 'married', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'wo', ""n't"", 'move', 'lives', 'simple', 'premise', 'rest', 'story', 'deals', 'what', 'when', 'one', 'get', 'serious', 'someone', 'else', 'how', 'prepared', 'what', 'will', 'do', 'relationship', 'stop-start', 'confusion', 'palpably', 'played', 'out', 'cool', 'lived-in', 'LA', 'feels', 'appropriate', 'setting', 'familiar', 'story', 'Jones', 'Celeste', 'carry', 'most', 'emotional', 'burden', 'genuine', 'likability', 'character', 'could', 'have', 'otherwise', 'been', 'downright', 'insufferable', 'constant', 'source', 'humor', 'clever', 'script.Samberg', 'good', 'first', 'serious', 'role', 'sometimes', 'too', 'recessive', 'counterbalance', 'Jones', 'energetic', 'presence', 'Emma', 'Roberts', 'Julia', 'niece', 'Valentine', 'Day', 'Celeste', 'petulant', 'Lady', 'Gaga-wannabe', 'pop', 'star', 'client', 'Riley', 'Banks', 'fervor', 'nice', 'edge', 'scenes', 'Jones', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'coiled', 'fun', 'playing', 'Celeste', 'uptight', 'gay', 'business', 'partner', 'Ari', 'Graynor', 'Conviction', 'Eric', 'Christian', 'Olsen', 'effectively', 'play', 'Beth', 'Tucker', 'accustomed', 'stereotypes', 'Chris', 'Messina', 'up', 'yet', 'again', 'prominent', 'supporting', 'role', 'time', 'Celeste', 'acerbic', 'patient', 'suitor', 'waiting', 'are', 'moments', 'scenes', 'even', 'where', 'felt', 'movie', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'satisfied', 'usually', 'amusing', 'twists', 'conventional', 'romcom', 'situations', 'mostly', 'involving', 'Celeste', 'inability', 'accept', 'inevitable', 'course', 'pressure', 'Jones', 'deliver', 'goods', 'star', 'screenwriter', 'quite', 'well', 'here']",N/A

Our eponymous lovers have been a couple for so long and are so compatible, not even a pending divorce can interrupt their constant joking, role playing and bawdy horseplay. They are best friends. This unpredictable and intelligent R-rated script, written by Harvard graduate Rashida Jones and Trinity College graduate Will McCormack, doesn't whitewash any of the characters. In fact, Celeste is the most flawed character in the film!We see:* Rashida Jones (""Parks and Recreation"") is Celeste, a whip-smart ad agency executive, stuck with an unwanted contract to promote The Next Lady Gaga, much to her chagrin! She and her best friend/husband of six years are separated, but she's ""doing GREAT!""* Andy Samberg (""Friends With Benefits"") is Jesse, her slacker husband. He's an artist who can't seem to meet any deadlines and is currently renting a mother-in-law apartment from his soon-to-be ex.* Rebecca Dayan (""Limitless"") is Veronica, the gorgeous but unexpected element who appears out of nowhere and sparks a crisis. Even though we may want to, we can't seem to make her the villain.* Chris Messina (""Like Crazy"") is Paul, a nice fellow who signed up for yoga because he wanted to meet women.* Ari Traynor (""What's Your Number"") is Beth, the patient best friend who can only watch in baffled frustration as her chum has a meltdown.* Eric Christian Olsen (Lots of TV) is Tucker, the fourth member of their constant foursome, who finds the antics of his separated friends to be disconcerting.* Emma Roberts (""It's Kind of a Funny Story"") is Riley, the tween diva who is petulant, spoiled, vain and desperate. She's the one destined to be ""The Next Lady Gaga!""* Elijah Wood (""Lord of the Rings"") is Celeste's boss, who counsels her to ""get out there and start dating again!"" (Well...maybe not those exact words...)* Will McCormack (Lots of TV) is Skillz, the drug dealer who naturally manages to maintain a friendship with both friends.Expect drug use and profanity, but no sweaty bodies, car chases, gunshots or blowie uppie stuff. The lovely Ms. Jones (who, by the way, is the daughter of Peggy Lipton and Quincy Jones) is a capable and appealing actress, and everyone else does a fine job, too!Idle speculation: Is Hollywood trying to tell us that being a slacker is normal for young men?

Rashida Jones and Andy Samberg are perfectly cast in the title roles; their characters are flawed but lovable, and both actors give sensitive and honest performances.  The supporting players are uniformly excellent, and director Lee Toland Krieger capitalizes on all the inherent laughter and heartache in the clever script which was written by leading lady Jones and Will McCormack (who also plays the part of Skillz in the film).The blu-ray offers superb picture and sound, and contains a numbers of bonus features, including a &#34;making of&#34; featurette, a Q&A; session conducted at the LA Film Fest where the film made its debut, a few deleted scenes, two commentaries, and the theatrical trailer for this film and several other Sony Pictures Classics releases.  For me, the biggest surprise contained in the bonus material was interview footage of Andy Samberg, in which he expressed a certain level of insecurity about his ability to play the more serious scenes in the film; I've always detected a layer of truth in his comedy, even when he was playing slapstick, and so it didn't surprise me at all that he was able to tap into that same humanity and play drama convincingly.&#34;Celeste and Jesse Forever&#34; is highly recommended to fans of the various cast members, to moviegoers looking for a new spin on an old theme (romantic comedies about divorced couples), and to student filmmakers interested in seeing how a small, modestly budgeted film can be expertly put together.

Written by Rashida Jones (TV's ""Parks and Recreation"") it is based on a real life relationship she had with co-star Will McCormack who plays Skillz, a close friend.In a breakout performance Jones carries the movie as a just turned 30 year old whose marriage to Jesse (Andy Samberg) she summarily decides to end. He doesn't resist but they vow to remain best friends. Their relationship goes back to their school days and while they seem perfectly happy, Celeste can't see children with him or a traditional future. Jesse is an artist who has no motivation to be successful. He's satisfied watching reruns of the Beijing Olympics.Celeste is a borderline successful marketing executive who has just signed one of the young vapid pop stars of the day (Emma Roberts). A series of blunders puts the two at odds but ultimately close. The real story here is the emotional roller coaster Celeste and Jesse go through once Jesse finds another beautiful woman who becomes pregnant. Celeste plays the dating game for a while but is uncomfortable with the whole idea. It is then they both realize they didn't understand each other as much as they thought.Backed by an excellent supporting cast, especially Elijah Wood as Celeste's gay business partner and Ari Graynor as her best friend, Jones is a wonder in this slightly off-kilter film. She shows remarkable range as she goes from hysterically funny to drunk and disorderly to being drained emotionally.

This is one of those movies that, when you reflect back on the situations the main characters find themselves in, you really appreciate the movie and may end up watching it a second or third time through.  The acting was solid, especially when it needed to be (like when she finds out the big news), and most of the time when I asked myself: &#34;How would I react to that?&#34;, their reactions were largely similar to what mine would have been.My favorite part is the &#34;climax&#34; when the two main characters finally confront their emotions outside of the bar and they do it angrily and storm off.  You can really feel Rashida Jones' heart breaking in that sequence of scenes as she is at her wit's end and has nothing left to lose so she goes for broke and comes up short.This ending was the type of ending I LOVE because you will like it, or dislike it, based on who you are as a person.  No doubt they are perfect for each other and had great chemistry (both in the movie and as actor/actress) and this really made the point stick that sometimes life just doesn't happen the way we want it to and no matter how much we kick and scream, it carries on with or without us.I actually loved the language in this movie.

1607731,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00ADRYCWC,Paul Allaer,"[1, 1]","""Celeste and Jesse Forever"" (2012 release; 92 min.) brings the story of Celeste (played by Rashida Jones, who also co-wrote the script) and Jesse (played by Andy Semberg), who have been ""best friends forever"" since their youth, got married 6 years ago, and now are separating but still remain friends. One day Jesse runs into Veronica, a Belgian girl (played by Rebecca Dayan), and starts dating her, even though he remains tormented by the loss of Celeste. In the rest of the movie we watch and wonder whether Celeste and Jesse ultimately will reconcile.First off, you need to take a leap of faith that, despite still being BFFs, Celeste and Jesse are in the process of divorcing. It's never explained why that is happening, other than a general ""taking each other for granted"" type explanation (which does not square with the two spending all their time together). But once you can get over that, the movie works like a charm. Jones just oozes charisma, and with her recent roles in The Social Network, The Muppets, and Our Idiot Brother (not to mention her TV work on Parks and Recreation), she is cearly an up-and-coming talent. Can't wait to see what she will do next. There are several other smaller but still choice roles in here, notably Elijah Wood as Celeste's boss, Emma Roberts (niece of Julia Roberts by the way) as the Ke$ha-like pop singer, and the already mentioned Rebecca Dayan as the Belgian girl.Bottom line, I really enjoyed this more than what I expected going in, and in that sense ""Celeste and Jesse Forever"" is another winning indie rom-com, not unlike, say, Ruby Sparks, Friends With Kids or even Your Sister's Sister.

From what could have been just another mediocre story, this one gets lifted from the movie-watching doldrums due to an amazing performance by Rashida Jones.  She brings a much needed warmth, depth of emotion and palpable vulnerability to Celeste.  Jones lifts this plot and shines as her character's fire continually flares-up, then burns-out and ignites again.The movie begins with a germinal opening montage of the history of Celeste and Jesse (Andy Samberg).  From High School sweethearts, through college, to their subsequent wedding day, their relationship plays through with an inerrant soundtrack which makes all the difference with this treatment.  Original songs along with smoky melodies (Sunny Levine and Zach Cowie for 'Biggest Crush') add intelligence and quiddity with a soulful touch.The couple is out having dinner with their close college friends Beth and Tucker, feeling quite pensive and dismayed while watching the demonstratively frisky pair across the table.  They are making ready for their own wedding.  Celeste and Jesse are now divorcing and live separately, although are still affectionately close friends.These two are constantly together; going out socially, are extremely playful with one another, but things just didn't work out therefore they still are having too much conflict over their decision.  While the movie gives a great look into their friendship and the love that remains, the reason for their separation is not altogether clear. This is where the whole drive of the plot would have stalled, although these actors' solid treatment of their characters counterstep this and make the following situations plausible.Deciding to date others is a major problem, especially for Celeste while an old flame, Veronica, reenters the picture of Jesse.  While her entire life dives into a histrionic tailspin, Jesse discovers his new girlfriend is pregnant.  He, later, after much back and forth with Celeste's and his own antics, decides he may want to ""make things work with Veronica"" contemplating being a father.  All of this just in time for their best friend's wedding.Rashida Jones co-writes 'Celeste' to be the primary character and easily shows her ability to carry a movie.  Director Lee Toland Krieger (The Vicious Kind) includes bit, but never too small, character roles. Elijah Wood is her comically direct boss and Emma Roberts portrays her risible, self-absorbed musical client adding a shift to the storyline and pulls it from the questioning and unresolved couple.  This is a smarter indie comedy that is refreshing, digging deep in many places and introduces Rashida Jones as a major player.",4,"""There's No Charades Going On Here ...

1607747,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00ADRYCWC,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 2]","""Celeste & Jesse Forever"" is a sweet romantic comedy that attempts to twist some conventions of the ever popular genre. The film is about Celeste and Jesse who were high school sweethearts. They went on to get married, but later Celeste, now a successful trend analyzer, decided that they should divorce while maintaining a friendship. They are still best friends - their divorce is not finalized - and, with her nice ""ex-husband"" around (who seems still attracted to her), the life of Celeste is going well.But one day Jesse confesses that he has been dating a new girlfriend (who is now pregnant). Now Celeste must face a difficult choice: Will she really move on or not? Told largely from Celeste's viewpoint, the story of ""Celeste & Jesse Forever"" (directed by Lee Toland Krieger, ""The Vicious Kind"") reminds us that breaking up is hard to do, especially when we, like Celeste, don't know what we really want to do.The film's greatest asset is, not surprisingly, the title characters Celeste and Jesse and the chemistry between Rashida Jones and Andy Samberg. Whenever they share the screen, the film is amusing with the charming couple Celeste and Jesse. Unfortunately, most supporting characters including a spoiled starlet Riley Banks (Emma Roberts) and Celeste's business partner Scott (Elijah Wood) are far less interesting.""Celeste & Jesse Forever"" is a sweet, or bitter sweet, little romantic comedy.

1607748,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B00ADRYCWC,Turfseer,"[2, 4]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***'Celeste and Jesse Forever' is a witty comedy about an ex-couple who are still best friends and seemingly have everything in common together, but are on the verge of getting divorced. When we first meet Celeste and Jesse, played by the talented Rashida Jones (who was a co-writer of the screenplay) and Andy Samberg (of Saturday Night Live fame), it's evident that both these actors have tremendous chemistry together. Their best friends walk out on them at a restaurant because they can't believe that they're getting divorced, when they seem to be so in synch with one another. The couple does their 'shtick' together, adopting simultaneous mock German accents and simulating masturbation with a lip balm.Why is it that Jesse and Celeste are getting divorced, since they seem so compatible? Well, Celeste, an extremely successful 'trend forecaster' and cable news commentator, looks down on Jesse's lack of ambition; he's an aspiring artist who's taken freelance assignments, but really not making much money at all.I was expecting the plot to go in the direction of the couple drifting apart but eventually reconciling. But the story becomes something entirely different when Jesse reveals that a fling he had with old friend Veronica, a few months before, results in her becoming pregnant. Jesse decides to try and make things work with Veronica and Celeste must now cope with that new reality. Samberg virtually drops out of the film for a good part of the second Act, with everything now focusing on Jones, who plays Celeste as a young woman who is unable to have that one epiphany which will lead to self-discovery. When Jesse does interact with Celeste, the witty banter is gone, and ultimately he decides to throw his lot in with Veronica, a complete cipher of a character.Meanwhile, there are a succession of 'loser dates' Celeste goes on which don't quite make the grade in the comedy department. Much better is the Yoga Guy (Paul) who Celeste eventually ends up with. Fortunately Jones has just as much chemistry with Chris Messina who plays Paul as with Samberg. There's also a humorous sub-plot with Riley, a pop star, who Celeste ends up bonding with, despite a marketing gaffe with a gay theme.'Celeste and Jesse Forever' morphs into a tale of a young woman who must finally give up her arrogance in order to have a successful relationship. There's quite a bit of wit in the writing here but when things get 'serious' (after things sour between the once compatible couple), the film isn't quite as successful. 'Celeste and Jesse Forever' is mainly worth seeing for the chemistry between the principals (in the early part of the film), witty dialogue and some of the sub-plots that keep the story moving.",3,Witty dialogue and good performances save weak narrative of dissolution of once compatible couple,1359244800,"01 27, 2013",2013,2759,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', ""***'Celeste"", 'Jesse', 'Forever', 'witty', 'comedy', 'ex-couple', 'who', 'are', 'still', 'best', 'friends', 'seemingly', 'have', 'everything', 'common', 'together', 'are', 'verge', 'getting', 'divorced', 'When', 'first', 'meet', 'Celeste', 'Jesse', 'played', 'talented', 'Rashida', 'Jones', 'who', 'was', 'co-writer', 'screenplay', 'Andy', 'Samberg', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'fame', 'evident', 'actors', 'have', 'tremendous', 'chemistry', 'together', 'best', 'friends', 'walk', 'out', 'restaurant', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', ""'re"", 'getting', 'divorced', 'when', 'seem', 'be', 'so', 'synch', 'one', 'couple', ""'shtick"", 'together', 'adopting', 'simultaneous', 'mock', 'German', 'accents', 'simulating', 'masturbation', 'lip', 'balm.Why', 'Jesse', 'Celeste', 'are', 'getting', 'divorced', 'seem', 'so', 'compatible', 'Well', 'Celeste', 'extremely', 'successful', ""'trend"", 'forecaster', 'cable', 'news', 'commentator', 'down', 'Jesse', 'lack', 'ambition', 'aspiring', 'artist', 'who', 'taken', 'freelance', 'assignments', 'really', 'not', 'making', 'much', 'money', 'all.I', 'was', 'expecting', 'plot', 'go', 'direction', 'couple', 'drifting', 'apart', 'eventually', 'reconciling', 'story', 'something', 'entirely', 'different', 'when', 'Jesse', 'fling', 'had', 'old', 'friend', 'Veronica', 'few', 'months', 'results', 'becoming', 'pregnant', 'Jesse', 'try', 'make', 'things', 'work', 'Veronica', 'Celeste', 'must', 'now', 'cope', 'new', 'reality', 'Samberg', 'virtually', 'film', 'good', 'part', 'second', 'Act', 'everything', 'now', 'focusing', 'Jones', 'who', 'Celeste', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'unable', 'have', 'one', 'epiphany', 'will', 'lead', 'self-discovery', 'When', 'Jesse', 'interact', 'Celeste', 'witty', 'banter', 'gone', 'ultimately', 'throw', 'lot', 'Veronica', 'complete', 'cipher', 'character.Meanwhile', 'are', 'succession', ""'loser"", 'dates', 'Celeste', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'make', 'grade', 'comedy', 'department', 'Much', 'better', 'Yoga', 'Guy', 'Paul', 'who', 'Celeste', 'eventually', 'up', 'Fortunately', 'Jones', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'chemistry', 'Chris', 'Messina', 'who', 'Paul', 'Samberg', 'also', 'humorous', 'sub-plot', 'Riley', 'pop', 'star', 'who', 'Celeste', 'up', 'bonding', 'marketing', 'gaffe', 'gay', 'theme', ""'Celeste"", 'Jesse', 'Forever', 'morphs', 'tale', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'must', 'finally', 'give', 'up', 'arrogance', 'order', 'have', 'successful', 'relationship', 'quite', 'bit', 'wit', 'writing', 'here', 'when', 'things', 'get', ""'serious"", 'things', 'sour', 'once', 'compatible', 'couple', 'film', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'successful', ""'Celeste"", 'Jesse', 'Forever', 'mainly', 'worth', 'seeing', 'chemistry', 'principals', 'early', 'part', 'film', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'sub-plots', 'keep', 'story', 'moving']",N/A
