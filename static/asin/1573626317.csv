190670,A3KCKMRUCEE1BA,1573626317,Eric Finkelstein,"[7, 9]",I think that this film was a very good movie.  It had a lot of action and suspense which kept me entertained throughout the entire film.  It also had some very impressive and amazing effects which were also enjoyable.  The performances by the film's cast were convincing and believable.  I disagree with the critics who think that is a boring or depressing film.  I personally liked this film and I think that it's really worth watching.,4,A great film with a lot of suspense.,979084800,"01 10, 2001",2001,437,"['think', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'had', 'lot', 'action', 'suspense', 'kept', 'entertained', 'entire', 'film', 'also', 'had', 'very', 'impressive', 'amazing', 'effects', 'were', 'also', 'enjoyable', 'performances', 'film', 'cast', 'were', 'convincing', 'believable', 'disagree', 'critics', 'who', 'think', 'boring', 'depressing', 'film', 'personally', 'liked', 'film', 'think', 'really', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A

The actors are very good including Bakula, Kristoffersen, Dennehy and Going. The screenplay is just plain uninteresting. Thankfully the talented and beautiful Joanna Going kept my eyes open.

Scott Bakula tries to play a tough fearless agent working for the FBI but comes across as a Clint Eastwood wannabe. Cute and sexy Joanna Going plays his loyal admiring sidekick and does a good job keeping one's interest. Other than that, the storyline could have been taken from a Captain Marvel comic book with a little folksy dinner table chat thrown in which instead of warming one's heart makes one want to vomit the dinner.",1,choppy clint eastwood style non-sense,1267142400,"02 26, 2010",2010,499,"['just', 'watched', 'old', 'VHS', 'movie', 'got', '1', 'library', 'Scott', 'Bakula', 'play', 'tough', 'fearless', 'agent', 'working', 'FBI', 'across', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'wannabe', 'Cute', 'sexy', 'Joanna', 'Going', 'loyal', 'admiring', 'sidekick', 'good', 'job', 'keeping', 'one', 'interest', 'Other', 'storyline', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'taken', 'Captain', 'Marvel', 'comic', 'book', 'little', 'folksy', 'dinner', 'table', 'chat', 'instead', 'warming', 'one', 'heart', 'one', 'want', 'vomit', 'dinner']",N/A

The &quot;who-dunnit&quot; scheme was well done, and Judge Reinhold's part as the very-obvious-reference-to-Bill-Gate, Janus, is  spookingly well done.  And then there's the honestly surprising surprise  ending...  Technology seemed a little ahead for 2005, and the romance  between Scott and Joanna somewhat got in the way.

As a miniseries is very good and you will sure have a good time if you like this kind of action movie.For  those interested in the spanish subtitles of this DVD, I can tell you that  they do not work properly.  There is a 10 to 12 second delay between their  english pronunciation and the appearance of the corresponding subtitles on  screen.  It does not sound like much, but 10 seconds in a movie is a long  time, and completely destroys your understanding and enjoyment of the  film.I can not understand why some DVD producers disregard the  importance of good quality second language subtitles or dubbing as in this  case, if the USA and Canadian market have so many spanish speaking and  french speaking people.",4,Good action movie but the book is better ...,958003200,"05 11, 2000",2000,822,"['think', 'Tom', 'Clancy', 'books', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'films', 'again', 'true', 'movie', 'miniseries', 'very', 'good', 'will', 'sure', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'like', 'kind', 'action', 'movie.For', 'interested', 'spanish', 'subtitles', 'DVD', 'can', 'tell', 'do', 'not', 'work', 'properly', '10', '12', 'second', 'delay', 'english', 'pronunciation', 'appearance', 'corresponding', 'subtitles', 'screen', 'not', 'sound', 'much', '10', 'seconds', 'movie', 'long', 'time', 'completely', 'destroys', 'understanding', 'enjoyment', 'film.I', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'why', 'DVD', 'producers', 'disregard', 'importance', 'good', 'quality', 'second', 'language', 'subtitles', 'dubbing', 'case', 'USA', 'Canadian', 'market', 'have', 'so', 'many', 'spanish', 'speaking', 'french', 'speaking', 'people']",N/A
