576728,AURWY3GPQ0S86,B00005AAEH,J. J. Carew,"[95, 139]","I enjoy reading and watching documentaries on the early years of Christianity. When the Discovery Channel premiered this documentary several years ago I watched it. Several things popped out at me while watching the 4-hour broadcast. I recently borrowed it from my library to watch again and see if I'd like to purchase it. A big NO and here is why.One thing this documentary states is that the Gospels can not be trusted because they are based on oral history. According to the show's producers, only archeologists can tell us what ACTUALLY happened with the life and death of Jesus. This is an incorrect assumption. It's my understanding that you can line up three people standing in the same place seeing the same car accident and all three will have the same basic story but their stories won't be exact. Does that mean their stories can't be trusted?Read the following quotes from the narration of the program and you can decide if you want to watch or buy this program:""'Something' must have stirred his(Jesus) determination to right the wrongs he saw in his society."" Hmmm--what could that something be? According to this program, perhaps when you are the son of God you still need motivation.When picking his apostles, Jesus was said to have ""a bizarre recruitment drive."" I used to be a journalist and when I see or hear ""documentaries"" using adjectives such as above shows that the writer is not being objective. Who says the way he picked his apostles was bizarre besides the creators of the program?Here is the one that turned my head: ""He was baptized by John. This simple act seems to have CONVINCED him he was the long-awaited Messiah."" I'll let you make up your own mind on that one.I won't even get into the fact that the program states ""it is a well-known and documented fact that Jesus had sisters and brothers.""  Well, there are about a billion Catholics who beg to differ on that one and I won't go into that argument.I am not impressed by the assumptions the writers and producers of this program made and try to pawn off as ""fact"".Overall a very subjective view and not ""complete"" in any way. If you do buy, buy with caution. But I say this about most religious/historical documentaries.  There is a point where science can not answer all the questions asked.  I once heard that ""Faith is believing in something when common sense tells you not to.""If you are truly interested in a more balanced look at Jesus and the early church, try Frontline: From Jesus to Christ produced by PBS in 1998 or the Rise of Christianity: The first 1000 years. They at least show more than one side to some Jesus stories, such as whether Jesus had brothers and sisters.  They also do not foist a lot of subjective adjectives onto the viewer.",2,Not the best,1112140800,"03 30, 2005",2005,2745,"['enjoy', 'reading', 'watching', 'documentaries', 'early', 'years', 'Christianity', 'When', 'Discovery', 'Channel', 'premiered', 'documentary', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'watched', 'Several', 'things', 'popped', 'out', 'watching', '4-hour', 'broadcast', 'recently', 'borrowed', 'library', 'watch', 'again', 'see', ""'d"", 'like', 'purchase', 'big', 'NO', 'here', 'why.One', 'thing', 'documentary', 'states', 'Gospels', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'trusted', 'are', 'based', 'oral', 'history', 'According', 'show', 'producers', 'only', 'can', 'tell', 'ACTUALLY', 'happened', 'life', 'death', 'Jesus', 'incorrect', 'assumption', 'understanding', 'can', 'line', 'up', 'three', 'people', 'standing', 'same', 'place', 'seeing', 'same', 'car', 'accident', 'three', 'will', 'have', 'same', 'basic', 'story', 'stories', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'exact', 'mean', 'stories', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'trusted', 'Read', 'following', 'quotes', 'narration', 'program', 'can', 'decide', 'want', 'watch', 'buy', 'program', ""'Something"", 'must', 'have', 'stirred', 'Jesus', 'determination', 'right', 'wrongs', 'saw', 'society', 'Hmmm', 'what', 'could', 'something', 'be', 'According', 'program', 'perhaps', 'when', 'are', 'son', 'God', 'still', 'need', 'motivation.When', 'picking', 'apostles', 'Jesus', 'was', 'said', 'have', 'bizarre', 'recruitment', 'drive', 'used', 'be', 'journalist', 'when', 'see', 'hear', 'documentaries', 'using', 'adjectives', 'such', 'above', 'writer', 'not', 'being', 'objective', 'Who', 'way', 'picked', 'apostles', 'was', 'bizarre', 'creators', 'program', 'Here', 'one', 'turned', 'head', 'was', 'baptized', 'John', 'simple', 'act', 'have', 'CONVINCED', 'was', 'long-awaited', 'Messiah', ""'ll"", 'let', 'make', 'up', 'own', 'mind', 'one.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'fact', 'program', 'well-known', 'documented', 'fact', 'Jesus', 'had', 'sisters', 'brothers', 'Well', 'are', 'billion', 'Catholics', 'who', 'beg', 'differ', 'one', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'argument.I', 'am', 'not', 'impressed', 'assumptions', 'writers', 'producers', 'program', 'made', 'try', 'pawn', 'off', 'fact', 'very', 'subjective', 'view', 'not', 'complete', 'way', 'do', 'buy', 'buy', 'caution', 'say', 'most', 'religious/historical', 'documentaries', 'point', 'where', 'science', 'can', 'not', 'answer', 'questions', 'asked', 'once', 'heard', 'Faith', 'believing', 'something', 'when', 'common', 'sense', 'tells', 'not', 'are', 'truly', 'interested', 'more', 'balanced', 'look', 'Jesus', 'early', 'church', 'try', 'Frontline', 'From', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'produced', 'PBS', '1998', 'Rise', 'Christianity', 'first', '1000', 'years', 'least', 'show', 'more', 'one', 'side', 'Jesus', 'stories', 'such', 'Jesus', 'had', 'brothers', 'sisters', 'also', 'do', 'not', 'foist', 'lot', 'subjective', 'adjectives', 'viewer']",Jesus - The Complete Story VHS
576729,A2D9TA1EYXA9KR,B00005AAEH,"J. Kara Russell ""Actress/Artist/Musician/Writer""","[59, 77]","I tend to be very skeptical of &quot;life of Jesus&quot; illustrations.  I watch a lot of historical programs on previous cultures, and I understand that while the science can determine and confirm certain aspects, it is easy to extrapolate into fictionalized accounts and storytelling.There have been other &quot;scientific&quot; searches for Jesus, using archeological evidence, but they are often so obviously done by non-Christians, or even anti-Christians, that their bias is clear while they pretend to be impartial.  This series does have a bias, too.  It is produced by theologians, and yes, they clearly have belief; but they do not push that aspect.  Rather, this program says this &quot;X&quot; (science) proves this &quot;Y&quot; (biblical description) to be true.  They compare it to other events, but do not make assumptions, but leave the rest for your own conclusions.  I found this series fascinating, well done, and balanced, using scientific process to illuminate biblical text, and relate it to today.  The forensic reconstruction is particularly interesting.

Kaminski ""j_s_k""","[14, 14]","This was an interesting program, but it is important to note that it was not produced from a religious perspective;  there is little if anything here having to do with dogma or theology.  What it does do, however, is try to explain biblical events from measureable criteria, like science or archaeology.  Some of the things you'll see are:  the type of house or dwelling where Jesus may have been born (maybe not the traditional ""manger"" scene);  a fishing boat recovered from the Sea Of Galilee dating to the first century (the famous ""Jesus Boat""); the town of Caperneum and the possible house of St. Peter; and several digitized recreations of places like first-century Bethlehem and Jerusalem, giving the viewer an idea of how things might have looked during Jesus' lifetime.From a scientific viewpoint, there are discussions about the possibility of a virgin birth, the astronomical events that may have led to the story of the wise men following a star, the length of time a crucified man could survive on a cross, and even a computer-generated ""educated guess"" about what a 1st-century man from Nazareth might look like.Overall this was an informative video, but again, it is not a religious lesson and it is assumed the viewer already knows a few things about Jesus of Nazareth.

It never says what Christians believe is false, it just presents several alternative translations of the original language of the Bible.I watch this documentary every time it airs & plan to buy the DVD.  It is not athiestic, it just questions the translations of the Bible and points out that it was not hand written by the Apostles.  The stories had been told by word of mouth, they do not discount the stories but just point out that there is room for error.The producers never say the events didn't happen, they just present all alternatives in translating the original text of the Bible.For example, the English text of the birth of Jesus says there was no room at the ""Inn"" and he had to be born in a ""Manger"".  The documentary points out a possible error in the translation, the word translated into ""Inn"" probably does not refer to a hotel type of building, but rather the sleeping quarters of a home.  And the ""Manger"" was really the area of the home where the livestock was kept.  Upper & lower levels of the home.This will open up discussions of the Bible, and give new possibilities to its meaning.",5,Excellent tool for Bible Study Groups.
