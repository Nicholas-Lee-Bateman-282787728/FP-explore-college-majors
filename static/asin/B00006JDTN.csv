I was one of those people, having seen the film in a Pentecostal church with my then best friend back in high school in 1974. I was raised in a Methodist church that seldom spoke of salvation and never spoke of the rapture, so the entire concept presented in the film was new to me at the time.Thus, I guess you could say this film did some good in the fact that some were brought to Christ either as a direct or indirect result of watching it. However, it does tend to rock already saved ones into a sense of complacency in relation to the doctrine of the rapture of all Christians prior to the great tribulation, when a careful study of the Bible shows that this is not the case. In that sense, the film does a disservice.As other reviewers have mentioned, the acting is B-rated, but that is not really the point of the movie. It was not trying to break box office records or win awards. I haven't seen this film in over thirty years, but the memory that still stands out the most to me is that of the heroine of the film going to church on Sunday, trying to find something of the spiritual experience her new husband has found, and being treated instead to a very dead dull sermon. After the rapture, she goes to the church and finds the tormented preacher who has also been left behind lamenting - ""Another one!"". In other words, apparently large numbers of his paritioners as well as himself have never known Christ's salvation.From a psychological standpoint you have to ask yourself why this film is so frightening. Most people, especially Americans, have been taught their whole lives about the torments of hell that await those who die unredeemed, yet nothing seems to frighten people more than the idea of being left on earth by God to be hunted and persecuted by their fellow man. This is probably because most people have never seen an actual demon, but they have seen plenty of the evil man is capable of, and it is therefore more real to them.",3,More of a recollection than a recommendation,1163116800,"11 10, 2006",2006,2150,"['movie', 'was', 'commonly', 'shown', 'churches', '1970', 'frightened', 'many', 'non-believers', 'so', 'badly', 'did', 'begin', 'consider', 'own', 'spiritual', 'condition', 'come', 'salvation', 'was', 'one', 'people', 'having', 'seen', 'film', 'Pentecostal', 'church', 'then', 'best', 'friend', 'back', 'high', 'school', '1974', 'was', 'raised', 'Methodist', 'church', 'spoke', 'salvation', 'never', 'spoke', 'rapture', 'entire', 'concept', 'presented', 'film', 'was', 'new', 'time.Thus', 'guess', 'could', 'say', 'film', 'did', 'good', 'fact', 'were', 'brought', 'Christ', 'either', 'direct', 'indirect', 'result', 'watching', 'However', 'tend', 'rock', 'already', 'saved', 'ones', 'sense', 'complacency', 'relation', 'doctrine', 'rapture', 'Christians', 'prior', 'great', 'tribulation', 'when', 'careful', 'study', 'Bible', 'not', 'case', 'sense', 'film', 'disservice.As', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'mentioned', 'acting', 'B-rated', 'not', 'really', 'point', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'trying', 'break', 'box', 'office', 'records', 'win', 'awards', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'thirty', 'years', 'memory', 'still', 'out', 'most', 'heroine', 'film', 'going', 'church', 'Sunday', 'trying', 'find', 'something', 'spiritual', 'experience', 'new', 'husband', 'found', 'being', 'treated', 'instead', 'very', 'dead', 'dull', 'sermon', 'rapture', 'church', 'tormented', 'preacher', 'who', 'also', 'been', 'left', 'lamenting', 'one', 'other', 'words', 'apparently', 'large', 'numbers', 'paritioners', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'never', 'known', 'Christ', 'salvation.From', 'psychological', 'standpoint', 'have', 'ask', 'why', 'film', 'so', 'frightening', 'Most', 'people', 'especially', 'Americans', 'have', 'been', 'taught', 'whole', 'lives', 'torments', 'hell', 'await', 'who', 'die', 'unredeemed', 'yet', 'nothing', 'frighten', 'people', 'more', 'idea', 'being', 'left', 'earth', 'God', 'be', 'hunted', 'persecuted', 'fellow', 'man', 'probably', 'most', 'people', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'actual', 'demon', 'have', 'seen', 'plenty', 'evil', 'man', 'capable', 'therefore', 'more', 'real']",A Thief in the Night

These films did something I'd not quite expected . . . they revealed what life would be like for Christians who were left behind.Now, to begin, these movies were already cheesy when I saw them in 1986.  I knew they were based in the seventies because I'd seen similiar clothing and hairstyles in movies and photographs.  (which is logical, considering that the seventies were also the era of the Jesus movement, though I grant Jesus Christ, Superstar, far more credit than I grant this movie and its delightful, if overly preachy, sequels).Of the film set, this one is clearly the most honest of them.  Patty gets a taste of what it's like to learn her husband Jim, who (big shock, huh,) only became a Christian the night before.  The film first takes us into Patty's past, then into the ""future.""Before, I thought Patty was merely traumatized and angry.  With such a situation, I wouldn't be shocked at all to be that way myself.  Still, I thought she was largely paid to scream (indicating a good reason for her assisting cast to be present.)  But my mother had gotten so angry with Patty that she forbade us from then on to say hamburger and Patty in the same sentence.At last, I have seen the light and turned away from the christian path.  But I continued my studies of the bible.  I have also attained an adoration for the honesty of horror films. (Perhaps I have read too much Camille Paglia.) Anyhow, with my christian blinders dispelled, I can now understand Patty's panic, rage, and disgust much more clearly.This is good for anyone who 1) desires a good scare, 2) can tolerate being preached at constantly, 3) enjoys films about the end of the world.  (In a way, these films are somewhat variations on the Romero zombie films.)  4) Doesn't get the point of Left behind (which I found boring) and wants to get the original source.",3,"God isn't only a thief, he's a killer, a liar, and a voyeur.",1065916800,"10 12, 2003",2003,1953,"['saw', 'movie', 'first', 'when', 'was', 'ten', 'years', 'old', 'already', 'had', 'been', 'studying', 'biblical', 'prophecies', 'years', 'films', 'did', 'something', ""'d"", 'not', 'quite', 'expected', 'revealed', 'what', 'life', 'would', 'be', 'Christians', 'who', 'were', 'left', 'behind.Now', 'begin', 'movies', 'were', 'already', 'cheesy', 'when', 'saw', '1986', 'knew', 'were', 'based', 'seventies', ""'d"", 'seen', 'similiar', 'clothing', 'hairstyles', 'movies', 'photographs', 'logical', 'considering', 'seventies', 'were', 'also', 'era', 'Jesus', 'movement', 'grant', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'Superstar', 'far', 'more', 'credit', 'grant', 'movie', 'delightful', 'overly', 'preachy', 'sequels', '.Of', 'film', 'set', 'one', 'clearly', 'most', 'honest', 'Patty', 'taste', 'what', 'learn', 'husband', 'Jim', 'who', 'big', 'shock', 'huh', 'only', 'became', 'Christian', 'night', 'film', 'first', 'Patty', 'past', 'then', 'future', 'thought', 'Patty', 'was', 'merely', 'traumatized', 'angry', 'such', 'situation', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'shocked', 'be', 'way', 'Still', 'thought', 'was', 'largely', 'paid', 'scream', 'indicating', 'good', 'reason', 'assisting', 'cast', 'be', 'present', 'mother', 'had', 'gotten', 'so', 'angry', 'Patty', 'forbade', 'then', 'say', 'hamburger', 'Patty', 'same', 'sentence.At', 'last', 'have', 'seen', 'light', 'turned', 'away', 'christian', 'path', 'continued', 'studies', 'bible', 'have', 'also', 'attained', 'adoration', 'honesty', 'horror', 'films', 'Perhaps', 'have', 'read', 'too', 'much', 'Camille', 'Paglia', 'Anyhow', 'christian', 'blinders', 'dispelled', 'can', 'now', 'understand', 'Patty', 'panic', 'rage', 'disgust', 'much', 'more', 'clearly.This', 'good', 'anyone', 'who', '1', 'good', 'scare', '2', 'can', 'tolerate', 'being', 'preached', 'constantly', '3', 'films', 'end', 'world', 'way', 'films', 'are', 'somewhat', 'variations', 'Romero', 'zombie', 'films', '4', ""n't"", 'get', 'point', 'Left', 'behind', 'found', 'boring', 'get', 'original', 'source']",A Thief in the Night

In 1972 Thief in the Night was cutting-edge church drama.  Of course the acting seems a bit stiff, the dialogue forced, the message delivered without a hint of sublety.  However, this effort served as a catalyst for the many sophisticated media presentations of a popular Christian view of how the world as we know it ends (and begins).I remember seeing Thief in the Night roughly a quarter of a century ago--how it inspired me to greater dedication, and how a number people became serious about their faith for the first time.Seeing The film today is akin to watching some of the earliest Star Trek episodes.  The dated styles, the archiac technology, and the paper-shuffling government authorities are fun to remember.  Yet, in spite of the 30 years that have passed since its production, Thief in the Night's message remains timely.Perhaps the reintroduction of the Thief in the Night series will garner new appreciation for such modern productions as Left Behind, and the Apocalypse series.  Religious producers still do not have the budgets and tools available on the scale Hollywood uses.  Nevertheless, meaningful messages are being meaningfully done.Bottom-line:  Thief in the Night will prove most interesting to Christians who came of age in the 70s and 80s.  The acting is stiff, but not sloppy.  The message lacks nuance, but communicates clearly and realistically.
