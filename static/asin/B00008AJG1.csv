737003,A3TNM3C9ENUCFW,B00008AJG1,"A.M.Boughey ""Poetmaster""","[6, 8]","One has to ask when Burt Reynolds is going to hang up his acting shoes, after seeing this, having seen better performances from him of late in the Vision Express commercials. This is TV movie material through and through, and promises much in the way of steamy sex, intrigue and betrayal (should you believe the trailer, and cover sleeve) but is actually little more than bland throughout. Reynolds plays a New Orleans millionaire (with questionable connections) whose young attractive wife (played in sultry fashion by Saffron Burrows) is a constant worry to him, on the grounds of what he sees as her eventual, and inevitable infidelity. Not wanting to wait for this to just happen he offers a young hunk $50,000 to seduce the aforementioned Ms Burrows to ""test"" her love for her husband. As the wafer thin plot lumbers on, we are treated to a somewhat gratuitous over the table seduction scene, which is then consolidated sometime later by a more ""tender"" but equally lame staircase episode. The upshot of all of this is that our young stud refuses to do the job for the money , but then finds himself falling for the married woman and can't help himself. This of course unleases the wrath of the now extremely ticked off Mr Reynolds (I mean what did he expect?) who then becomes ... bent on dishing out retribution to the pair of them. What should then have been well set up into a good thriller with the opportunity for several twists and turns, is predictable and the movie goes down from this point at about the same speed as the Titanic. This movie really tries to be a solid psychological thriller, with an adult theme but suffers badly from a weak script, thin storyline and fairly average performances. I kept asking myself, as I'm sure most viewers will WHAT would have happened if Reynolds had left ""well enough alone"" as his young wife doesn't really shout out for an affair, but that's a moot point I guess. It is not overly BAD, but it isn't that good either. I got the feeling that Reynolds was simply going through the motions to get a paycheck, and Ms Burrows was far more polished and believable in Deep Blue Sea. All this being said, there's a fair amount of material here to keep most people happy who enjoy 10pm movies on the Mystery channel, but don't get your hopes up too high.",2,Predictable Formula Thriller,1058745600,"07 21, 2003",2003,2303,"['One', 'ask', 'when', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'going', 'hang', 'up', 'acting', 'shoes', 'seeing', 'having', 'seen', 'better', 'performances', 'late', 'Vision', 'Express', 'commercials', 'TV', 'movie', 'material', 'promises', 'much', 'way', 'steamy', 'sex', 'intrigue', 'betrayal', 'should', 'believe', 'trailer', 'cover', 'sleeve', 'actually', 'little', 'more', 'bland', 'Reynolds', 'New', 'Orleans', 'millionaire', 'questionable', 'connections', 'young', 'attractive', 'wife', 'played', 'sultry', 'fashion', 'Saffron', 'Burrows', 'constant', 'worry', 'grounds', 'what', 'eventual', 'inevitable', 'infidelity', 'Not', 'wanting', 'wait', 'just', 'happen', 'young', 'hunk', '50,000', 'seduce', 'aforementioned', 'Ms', 'Burrows', 'test', 'love', 'husband', 'wafer', 'thin', 'plot', 'lumbers', 'are', 'treated', 'somewhat', 'gratuitous', 'table', 'seduction', 'scene', 'then', 'consolidated', 'sometime', 'later', 'more', 'tender', 'equally', 'lame', 'staircase', 'episode', 'upshot', 'young', 'stud', 'refuses', 'do', 'job', 'money', 'then', 'falling', 'married', 'woman', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'course', 'wrath', 'now', 'extremely', 'ticked', 'off', 'Mr', 'Reynolds', 'mean', 'what', 'did', 'expect', 'who', 'then', 'bent', 'dishing', 'out', 'retribution', 'pair', 'What', 'should', 'then', 'have', 'been', 'well', 'set', 'up', 'good', 'thriller', 'opportunity', 'several', 'twists', 'turns', 'predictable', 'movie', 'down', 'point', 'same', 'speed', 'Titanic', 'movie', 'really', 'be', 'solid', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'adult', 'theme', 'suffers', 'badly', 'weak', 'script', 'thin', 'storyline', 'fairly', 'average', 'performances', 'kept', 'asking', ""'m"", 'sure', 'most', 'viewers', 'will', 'WHAT', 'would', 'have', 'happened', 'Reynolds', 'had', 'left', 'well', 'enough', 'alone', 'young', 'wife', ""n't"", 'really', 'shout', 'out', 'affair', 'moot', 'point', 'guess', 'not', 'overly', 'BAD', ""n't"", 'that', 'good', 'got', 'feeling', 'Reynolds', 'was', 'simply', 'going', 'motions', 'get', 'paycheck', 'Ms', 'Burrows', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'polished', 'believable', 'Deep', 'Blue', 'Sea', 'being', 'said', 'fair', 'amount', 'material', 'here', 'keep', 'most', 'people', 'happy', 'who', 'enjoy', '10pm', 'movies', 'Mystery', 'channel', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'hopes', 'too', 'high']",Tempted

He's really not a very good actor these days and the severely streched look of his numerous facelifts is a bit disconcerting, although his toupee is a stunner.That trivia aside, the plot is a good one and the acting is quite good, although the lady in question could use a slightly greater emotional range, considering the intensity of the plot. There are some surprises, too. I'd suggest buying the film so long as you realize that this is not the kind of film you watch over and over again, like, say, ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" or ""Rebecca"" (the original version).The New Orleans setting of ""Tempted"" has the wind-chimy flavor and humidity of Kathleen Turner's ""Body Heat"" from a while back, but lacks the intensity.

Burrows cuts the figure of a Greek sculpture; she's a prize all right, but no regular Southern Belle.The made-for-cable flick has one of those dirty pleasure plots: For reasons unknown, Reynolds' character is certain that Lilly (Burrows) means to cheat on him, so he hires a hunky handyman (Peter Facinelli) to seduce her. We wouldn't have a movie if the seduction wasn't successful. Double crosses and boiled over passions fill the rest of the running time. Burt hangs around for half the movie ...Everybody's just making some bones on this one, but it's nice to see Burrows turn up in something a little less esoteric.

737011,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00008AJG1,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 6]","I like Saffron Burrows, British beauty with undeniable talent, but what is she doing these days?  Fighting the 'intelligent' sharks in 'Deep Blue Sea'?  Doing cheesy Sci-fi in 'Wing Commander'?  Even in the recent blockbuster 'Troy' she was not that great.  Then I found this one in the catalogue, and decided to gibe it a chance.  But it turns out just another sad case of wasted talent.  Well, but I knew it's coming, though, when I saw the name of Ms. Burrows alongside with Burt Reynolds.  Oh, no....'Tempted' is a noir film set in New Orleans, where Burt Reyold's character, local tycoon, thinks that he is fatally ill, and asks a hunky boy Peter Fascinelli to seduce his wife, 'Lily' who is played by Burrows, to test her fidelity.  In short, he says, 'sleep with her' (but not for real), and if the kid, struggling law student, succeeds, the latter gets $10,000.  But what if the boy really does it?  and starts to love her?Who ever thought of this idea, I don't know, but it is certainly a good one.  But what a shame!  the director, Bill Bennett ('Kill or Kiss') doubly kills the interesting premise --  first by the incrediele casting of married couple Burt and Saffron (in fact, Burt's character wonders why this beautiful woman married him.  So do I, Burt).And the film is damaged more by the unnecessary subplot about one friend of Fascinelli.  Now, unaccountably, 'Tempted' does not stick to the original premise.  Instead, another murder plot concerning this friend is suddenly introduced without any relevance to the seduction theme, and though the story gets more and more complicated as it goes on, the thrills are always thin, and its initially steamy feeling soon goes away.The well-shot film is often beautiful to watch, and the acting is good all in all, even that of Reynolds, but the thrill-less entangled plot is only painful to follow, especially in the second half, and by the time you see the ending, you know why this film remains a 'little seen' one.",2,Crime in Hot New Orleans; Good Idea Killed by Weak Script,1091145600,"07 30, 2004",2004,1980,"['like', 'Saffron', 'Burrows', 'British', 'beauty', 'undeniable', 'talent', 'what', 'doing', 'days', 'Fighting', ""'intelligent"", 'sharks', ""'Deep"", 'Blue', 'Sea', 'Doing', 'cheesy', 'Sci-fi', ""'Wing"", 'Commander', 'Even', 'recent', 'blockbuster', 'was', 'not', 'great', 'Then', 'found', 'one', 'catalogue', 'decided', 'gibe', 'chance', 'out', 'just', 'sad', 'case', 'wasted', 'talent', 'Well', 'knew', 'coming', 'though', 'when', 'saw', 'name', 'Ms.', 'Burrows', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'Oh', "".'Tempted"", 'noir', 'film', 'set', 'New', 'Orleans', 'where', 'Burt', 'Reyold', 'character', 'local', 'tycoon', 'fatally', 'ill', 'hunky', 'boy', 'Peter', 'Fascinelli', 'seduce', 'wife', ""'Lily"", 'who', 'played', 'Burrows', 'test', 'fidelity', 'short', 'not', 'real', 'kid', 'struggling', 'law', 'student', 'latter', '10,000', 'what', 'boy', 'really', 'love', 'Who', 'ever', 'thought', 'idea', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'certainly', 'good', 'one', 'what', 'shame', 'director', 'Bill', 'Bennett', ""'Kill"", 'Kiss', 'doubly', 'interesting', 'premise', 'first', 'incrediele', 'casting', 'married', 'couple', 'Burt', 'Saffron', 'fact', 'Burt', 'character', 'wonders', 'why', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'married', 'So', 'do', 'Burt', '.And', 'film', 'damaged', 'more', 'unnecessary', 'subplot', 'one', 'friend', 'Fascinelli', 'Now', 'unaccountably', ""'Tempted"", 'not', 'stick', 'original', 'premise', 'Instead', 'murder', 'plot', 'concerning', 'friend', 'suddenly', 'introduced', 'relevance', 'seduction', 'theme', 'story', 'more', 'more', 'complicated', 'thrills', 'are', 'always', 'thin', 'initially', 'steamy', 'feeling', 'soon', 'away.The', 'well-shot', 'film', 'often', 'beautiful', 'watch', 'acting', 'good', 'even', 'Reynolds', 'thrill-less', 'entangled', 'plot', 'only', 'painful', 'follow', 'especially', 'second', 'half', 'time', 'see', 'ending', 'know', 'why', 'film', ""'little"", 'seen', 'one']",Tempted
