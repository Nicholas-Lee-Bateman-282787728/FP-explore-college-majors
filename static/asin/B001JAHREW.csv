Steven Bochco and David Milch created a real-life gritty police drama with innovative (hand held camera) techniques and very high production values. The 15th Precinct &#34;house&#34; looked as I imagine a precinct HQ would look like. Attention to detail in every scene -- using toilet paper to dry hands in the unisex bathroom in place of the always-missing paper towels. The cops are recognizable as everyday guys, working stiffs in a hard job. Imagine being a street cop in NYC. And the detectives aren't pictured as geniuses. They're just a step ahead of the skels and smart enough to figure things out. Story lines are always crisp and the show's pacing moves the story along with no waste. Even though the cast changed many times over the duration of the show, the show's identity never did. Cast changes were seamless, thanks in part (big part) to Dennis Franz who anchored the show flawlessly, even though his character, Sipowicz was mightily flawed. NYPD was Dennis Franz's finest moment..It's a pity that all twelve seasons weren't released as DVDs. I snapped the first four seasons up as soon as they hit the market and luckily, I had taped the full run when it appeared live on network TV back in the day. . .so I have all of the episodes.

1205961,A1NF9WS7RR82MX,B001JAHREW,J. Hill,"[0, 0]","NYPD Blue was always keeping its audience on its toes with unexpected changes, new characters, and the relentless evolution of the character of Andy Sipowicz.  Season 6 is no exception, as this was one of the most shocking (and highly rated) seasons in the show's run.  Not only do the twists and surprises continue throughout these episodes, but they also tie into the progression of Andy's character as he assumes the full series lead after the departure of Jimmy Smits.Anyone watching TV in 1998 surely remembers the publicity this show got out of the storyline about Bobby Simone's illness.  Every day, the ads reminded viewers that the countdown was on for the exit of Smits, and the fans tuned in.  After seeing ratings drop for three straight seasons, NYPD Blue nearly got back into the top ten with Season 6.  As a heart condition relentlessly weakens Bobby, Diane and Andy must struggle with his inevitable loss.  Dennis Franz and Kim Delaney both show incredible depth as actors as they portray the grieving process of their respective characters.Season 6 is a difficult bunch of episodes for any fan of this show to experience with Smits deciding to leave and his character written out with such a painfully slow death.  The shows are beautifully written and acted, with Bobby frequently having dreams/visions centered around his old pigeon-keeping mentor, Patsy.  Smits, Dennis Franz, and Delaney all give tear-jerking performances that are some of TV's best examples ever of dramatic acting.  The characters and viewers mourn the loss of a favorite character together, and the squad, just like the TV audience, is gradually led through the transition from Smits to Rick Schroeder's Danny Sorensen as Andy Sipowicz's partner.The first six shows are emotionally very heavy, but the tone shifts back somewhat lighter once Bobby passes and Danny comes into the squad.  Some funny moments pop up as the old characters respond to a new personality, Sipowicz in particular.  I always thought Schroeder did a fantastic job in this role, offering a completely different character from Simone, but one who's compelling to watch for his own reasons.  Sorensen is much more fragile than Bobby, but every bit as likable, as Diane soon finds out.  The first hints at their future relationship are seen by the end of the season, but like the transition from one detective to the next, this is a gradual process.  I'm a big fan of every season of NYPD Blue, but for obvious reasons, Season 6 is one of the most significant and important in the show's history.  For any fan, these are must-see episodes.",5,Incredible (and Tough) Season of NYPD Blue,1377388800,"08 25, 2013",2013,2599,"['NYPD', 'Blue', 'was', 'always', 'keeping', 'audience', 'toes', 'unexpected', 'changes', 'new', 'characters', 'relentless', 'evolution', 'character', 'Andy', 'Sipowicz', 'Season', '6', 'exception', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'shocking', 'highly', 'rated', 'seasons', 'show', 'run', 'Not', 'only', 'do', 'twists', 'surprises', 'continue', 'episodes', 'also', 'tie', 'progression', 'Andy', 'character', 'full', 'series', 'lead', 'departure', 'Jimmy', 'Smits.Anyone', 'watching', 'TV', '1998', 'surely', 'publicity', 'show', 'got', 'storyline', 'Bobby', 'Simone', 'illness', 'day', 'ads', 'reminded', 'viewers', 'countdown', 'was', 'exit', 'Smits', 'fans', 'tuned', 'seeing', 'ratings', 'drop', 'three', 'straight', 'seasons', 'NYPD', 'Blue', 'nearly', 'got', 'back', 'top', 'ten', 'Season', '6', 'heart', 'condition', 'relentlessly', 'Bobby', 'Diane', 'Andy', 'must', 'struggle', 'inevitable', 'loss', 'Dennis', 'Franz', 'Kim', 'Delaney', 'show', 'incredible', 'depth', 'as', 'actors', 'portray', 'grieving', 'process', 'respective', 'characters.Season', '6', 'difficult', 'bunch', 'episodes', 'fan', 'show', 'experience', 'Smits', 'deciding', 'leave', 'character', 'written', 'out', 'painfully', 'slow', 'death', 'shows', 'are', 'beautifully', 'written', 'acted', 'Bobby', 'frequently', 'having', 'dreams/visions', 'centered', 'old', 'pigeon-keeping', 'mentor', 'Patsy', 'Smits', 'Dennis', 'Franz', 'Delaney', 'give', 'tear-jerking', 'performances', 'are', 'TV', 'best', 'examples', 'ever', 'dramatic', 'acting', 'characters', 'viewers', 'mourn', 'loss', 'favorite', 'character', 'together', 'squad', 'just', 'TV', 'audience', 'gradually', 'led', 'transition', 'Smits', 'Rick', 'Schroeder', 'Danny', 'Sorensen', 'Andy', 'Sipowicz', 'partner.The', 'first', 'six', 'shows', 'are', 'emotionally', 'very', 'heavy', 'tone', 'shifts', 'back', 'somewhat', 'lighter', 'once', 'Bobby', 'passes', 'Danny', 'squad', 'funny', 'moments', 'pop', 'up', 'old', 'characters', 'respond', 'new', 'personality', 'Sipowicz', 'particular', 'always', 'thought', 'Schroeder', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'role', 'offering', 'completely', 'different', 'character', 'Simone', 'one', 'who', 'compelling', 'watch', 'own', 'reasons', 'Sorensen', 'much', 'more', 'fragile', 'Bobby', 'bit', 'likable', 'Diane', 'soon', 'out', 'first', 'hints', 'future', 'relationship', 'are', 'seen', 'end', 'season', 'transition', 'one', 'detective', 'next', 'gradual', 'process', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'season', 'NYPD', 'Blue', 'obvious', 'reasons', 'Season', '6', 'one', 'most', 'significant', 'important', 'show', 'history', 'fan', 'are', 'must-see', 'episodes']",NYPD Blue: Season 6

This is not a rating of the season itself, per se, but a rating of it's presentation on Amazon Instant Video.  The first five episodes of season six are among the best written, directed and performed of any episodic televison series.  I think it is the pinnacle of NYPD Blue.Unfortunately, on Amazon Instant Video there's serious flaw in what is the best NYPD Blue episode, ""Hearts and Souls"", which as you probably know is Jimmy Smits last regular appearance.  This episode originally aired as a 90-minute episode, so it should run about 63 minutes without commercials.  On Amazon Instant Video it runs only 46 minutes, which mean a hatchet job was done on the editing.  It is, in fact, the syndicated version of this episode.  This not to say Amazon.com is necessarily to blame.  This is apparently how the episode was supplied to them by the Studio(or whoever currently owns the show).  However, there is no warning about that anywhere on the site.  No efforts seem to have been made thus far to correct it.  The editing of this episode completely ruins it by eliminating the entire subplot, and even a small portion of the main plot.  I don't know if this is the case when you download the episode or the entire Season 6, but was certainly enough to prevent me from buying the season, as I had originally planned on doing.This is a serious error that needs to be corrected by Amazon.com ASAP.",2,Season Six on Instant Video Contains a Syndicated Version Episode,1380067200,"09 25, 2013",2013,1469,"['First', 'off', 'want', 'say', 'NYPD', 'Blue', 'one', 'time', 'favorite', 'shows', 'not', 'rating', 'season', 'se', 'rating', 'presentation', 'Amazon', 'Instant', 'Video', 'first', 'five', 'episodes', 'season', 'six', 'are', 'best', 'written', 'directed', 'performed', 'episodic', 'televison', 'series', 'think', 'pinnacle', 'NYPD', 'Blue.Unfortunately', 'Amazon', 'Instant', 'Video', 'serious', 'flaw', 'what', 'best', 'NYPD', 'Blue', 'episode', 'Hearts', 'Souls', 'probably', 'know', 'Jimmy', 'Smits', 'last', 'regular', 'appearance', 'episode', 'originally', 'aired', '90-minute', 'episode', 'should', 'run', '63', 'minutes', 'commercials', 'Amazon', 'Instant', 'Video', 'only', '46', 'minutes', 'mean', 'hatchet', 'job', 'was', 'done', 'editing', 'fact', 'syndicated', 'version', 'episode', 'not', 'say', 'Amazon.com', 'necessarily', 'blame', 'apparently', 'how', 'episode', 'was', 'supplied', 'Studio', 'whoever', 'currently', 'show', 'However', 'warning', 'anywhere', 'site', 'efforts', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'thus', 'far', 'correct', 'editing', 'episode', 'completely', 'eliminating', 'entire', 'subplot', 'even', 'small', 'portion', 'main', 'plot', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'case', 'when', 'download', 'episode', 'entire', 'Season', '6', 'was', 'certainly', 'enough', 'prevent', 'buying', 'season', 'had', 'originally', 'planned', 'doing.This', 'serious', 'error', 'be', 'corrected', 'Amazon.com', 'ASAP']",NYPD Blue: Season 6
