Shaeffer ""HockeyFanatic""","[14, 16]","Well, this movie is a remake, and the plot is quite familiar: Two young American women go vacationing in Argentina to get away from it all. After a night of drinking (predictably), one of the girls (played by Odette Yustman) gets mixed up with a violent, suspicious male. The next morning, the two girls get into an argument, and go their separate ways. When the other girl (played by Amber Heard) returns, her friend is gone.The police become involved, but of course they don't know much and are very little help. There is an American male who is also searching for his girlfriend, and he helps search for the missing girl. Predictably, people are not who they seem. There are some twists, and the scenery is visually stunning - but what really gives the film an edge is the exceptionally strong performance by Amber Heard. In a breakout performance, she manages to make the film tense and fast-paced all by herself. The story has been done ten thousand times before, but it would be hard to argue that any performance by a female lead in any of those other films were as strong as Heard's performance in this one.",3,Entertaining and Moderately Creepy Thriller,1294444800,"01 8, 2011",2011,1115,"['Well', 'movie', 'remake', 'plot', 'quite', 'familiar', 'Two', 'young', 'American', 'women', 'go', 'vacationing', 'Argentina', 'get', 'away', 'night', 'drinking', 'predictably', 'one', 'girls', 'played', 'Odette', 'Yustman', 'mixed', 'up', 'violent', 'suspicious', 'male', 'next', 'morning', 'two', 'girls', 'get', 'argument', 'go', 'separate', 'ways', 'When', 'other', 'girl', 'played', 'Amber', 'Heard', 'returns', 'friend', 'gone.The', 'police', 'become', 'involved', 'course', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'are', 'very', 'little', 'help', 'American', 'male', 'who', 'also', 'searching', 'girlfriend', 'search', 'missing', 'girl', 'Predictably', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'who', 'seem', 'are', 'twists', 'scenery', 'visually', 'stunning', 'what', 'really', 'film', 'edge', 'exceptionally', 'strong', 'performance', 'Amber', 'Heard', 'breakout', 'performance', 'make', 'film', 'tense', 'fast-paced', 'story', 'been', 'done', 'ten', 'thousand', 'times', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'argue', 'performance', 'female', 'lead', 'other', 'films', 'were', 'as', 'strong', 'Heard', 'performance', 'one']",N/A

1382518,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B00429C1TI,Eric Sanberg,"[3, 4]","I have not seen the original but it seems to be in big favor with many viewers. And as Hollywood figured to re-make it, it must have been good. Unfortunately, the re-make isn't really all that hot.In a nutshell: Two girls are on a biking excursion in Argentina. A minor argument ensues one day and the two take a few hours off from each others' company. Problem is that one of them disappears and may be another victim in a spate of local kidnappings. The other hooks up with an American who happens to be staying at the same hotel and the two set to see what they can see.From what I understand of the original, which was set in the French countryside, it's power derived from it's ability to take a serene countryside setting, in broad daylight, and infuse it with a sense of menace. In this version, most of the shots of the countryside look really beautiful and actually provide a respite from the uneasiness caused by the fact that you have two young girls, traveling alone in, what we consider, a third world country, working under a language barrier.This movie is so-so. For my dollar it took way too long to get to the heart of the matter. My guess is it's a good 45 minutes before the actual kidnapping occurs. And when it finally does occur the attempts at finding our victim are rather tepid. As a matter of fact, the break comes due to happenstance and not to any clever detective work. Another problem is that some of the promo copy intones that Karl Urban's character might not be the good guy he appears to be. If this is so, it is also handled poorly. Whatever questions the viewer might have about his motives are swept away rather quickly.Then there are the two female leads. The performances are not particularly great. And seeing Amber Heard's Stephanie get the jump on her friend's two captors did little to convince me she could or would do it. I simply didn't believe it and that is a problem at the script level.Like I said, this is a so-so movie. It isn't bad, but it's made me want to check out the original to see what intrigued the producers so much the saw the need to screw it up.",3,Ho Hum,1294012800,"01 3, 2011",2011,2110,"['have', 'not', 'seen', 'original', 'be', 'big', 'favor', 'many', 'viewers', 'Hollywood', 'figured', 're-make', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'Unfortunately', 're-make', ""n't"", 'really', 'all', 'nutshell', 'Two', 'girls', 'are', 'biking', 'excursion', 'Argentina', 'minor', 'argument', 'one', 'day', 'two', 'take', 'few', 'hours', 'others', 'company', 'Problem', 'one', 'disappears', 'may', 'be', 'victim', 'spate', 'local', 'kidnappings', 'other', 'up', 'American', 'who', 'be', 'staying', 'same', 'hotel', 'two', 'set', 'see', 'what', 'can', 'see.From', 'what', 'understand', 'original', 'was', 'set', 'French', 'countryside', 'power', 'derived', 'ability', 'take', 'serene', 'countryside', 'setting', 'broad', 'daylight', 'infuse', 'sense', 'menace', 'version', 'most', 'shots', 'countryside', 'look', 'really', 'beautiful', 'actually', 'provide', 'respite', 'uneasiness', 'caused', 'fact', 'have', 'two', 'young', 'girls', 'traveling', 'alone', 'what', 'consider', 'third', 'world', 'country', 'working', 'language', 'barrier.This', 'movie', 'so-so', 'dollar', 'took', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'get', 'heart', 'matter', 'guess', 'good', '45', 'minutes', 'actual', 'kidnapping', 'occurs', 'when', 'finally', 'occur', 'attempts', 'finding', 'victim', 'are', 'rather', 'tepid', 'matter', 'fact', 'break', 'due', 'happenstance', 'not', 'clever', 'detective', 'work', 'problem', 'promo', 'copy', 'intones', 'Karl', 'Urban', 'character', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'good', 'guy', 'be', 'so', 'also', 'handled', 'poorly', 'questions', 'viewer', 'might', 'have', 'motives', 'are', 'swept', 'away', 'rather', 'quickly.Then', 'are', 'two', 'female', 'leads', 'performances', 'are', 'not', 'particularly', 'great', 'seeing', 'Amber', 'Heard', 'Stephanie', 'get', 'jump', 'friend', 'two', 'captors', 'did', 'little', 'convince', 'could', 'would', 'do', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'believe', 'problem', 'script', 'level.Like', 'said', 'so-so', 'movie', ""n't"", 'bad', 'made', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'original', 'see', 'what', 'intrigued', 'producers', 'so', 'much', 'saw', 'need', 'screw', 'up']",N/A

I know that is crazy but it is true, some remakes go straight to DVD. I want to know why remake something if you do not release it theatrically. The remake of ""I Spit on your Grave"" was very good and could have done more if given the chance. This was one of those ones that went straight to DVD from what I can tell. Is it as good as the original, we will find out.Stephanie and Ellie are two American girls having a good time in Argentina and are about to go home. They have one night left so they go to the bar, of course they get drunk. They end up missing the bus the next day so they go on another little trip, bad move. They get separated and Ellie gets kidnapped so Steph is on her own. She seeks the help of a local policeman and another American named Michael who searching for his girlfriend.While I have seen the original film I will not speak on that one compared to this one. This film stands on its own and is actually better than expected. I went into this movie not expecting much and it turned out pretty good. Written by director Marcos Efron and Jennifer Derwingson it could have used a bit of a touch up in certain areas but over all it was good. The acting was on point Amber Heard was good as Steph as was OdetteYustman as Ellie but I would have to say Karl Urban and the police officer are excellent.Now I will say that while over all it is a good flick at times it is not believable for some reason. Could be the script or the direction or maybe even the acting but it is missing something. The film could have been really suspenseful if it had tried.

Great idea!I didn't hate this movie, but I didn't love it either.  Categorized as a PG-13 horror/thriller, there wasn't much to be expected other than two beautiful and talented women showing off their bodies and their acting abilities.  Somewhere in there we get Karl Urban as an expatriate with bad acting skill and a missing sister.  His character is supplementary at best, distractionary at worst.  Hint: His role could have been filled by a scarecrow.  Ignore him though, because these two chicks have jean shorts so short they literally touch internal organs.  Speaking of the literal, there is literally one single moment in the entire movie that wasn't status quo for this subgenre.  Of course, nothing completely disappoints either.  It's simply a recycle of the same thing you've seen before.  I guess the views of Argentina are beautiful enough to ignore the predictability.

The missing girl's friend tries to find out what happened, hampered by the language barrier and sinister uncooperative locals.  The original is considered something of a minor classic, but I had never heard of it until I came across this remake.  At which point I had to make a decision.  Should I rent this remake from my local library?  Or should I go to a bit of additional trouble to get the 1970 version?Well, I chose to see the 1970 original first, which was a good decision -- and I am here to STRONGLY advise you to do the same.  For two reasons: 1) The original is decent and this isn't.  And 2) this remake seemed to be aimed at people who have already seen the original anyway.  That is, it doesn't even bother trying to create suspense, and telegraphs its ""surprise twists"" so blatantly that only those expecting a slavishly faithful remake could possibly be surprised by them.But the remake is also a bad movie on its own terms!  First, the acting.  The three American leads are all terrible.  It is impossible to believe in their characters for a single moment.  Every word, gesture, and facial expression -- from Heard especially -- looks like bad acting and kills the scene.Then there is the characterization.  In the original, the flirtier of the two girls was a normal healthy young woman.  Here, ""Ellie"" is some kind of deranged freak who follows a guy into the Men's Room, uses the stalls with the door open, and then strikes up a conversation with him at the urinal.  What is the point of that?  I'm supposed to be scared FOR her, not OF her.  As for Heard's ""Stephanie"", the only background we get on her is that she's a needy doormat.  But the moment trouble strikes, she suddenly turns into Nancy Drew, Action Babe.  There is no attempt, as in the original, to make the audience feel like this situation might really happen to them, or to have the female lead react the way a real woman in her situation would.  Karl Urban's Enigmatic Expatriate character just randomly does what the script tells him to, rather than having any interior consistency, and projects about as much menace as a turnip.The plot is cookie-cutter and makes no real effort to amount to anything.  After failing to even try to be a suspense flick, it tries being an action film for a bit, at which it also fails.  A couple of torture and sexual assault scenes are tossed for exploitation purposes, but are brief.  Then the film tries being girl-powered for a bit, which is unconvincing.I will say some good things now.  The supporting cast is solid all around, including Adriana Barraza from DRAG ME TO HELL as the landlady.  One of the settings (the deserted village) looks wonderfully creepy even in bright sunlight, and is worthy of a better movie.Okay if you are looking for a bad movie to make fun of.  But definitely see the original first.  Another movie that is actually closer in type to this remake, but infinitely better in every way possible, would be RED EYE with Rachel McAdams and Cillian Murphy.  It's not perfect, but it's scary and good fun and the leads can act.",1,Bad Remake!,1300320000,"03 17, 2011",2011,3219,"['original', 'AND', 'SOON', 'THE', 'DARKNESS', 'was', '1970', 'suspense', 'film', 'two', 'English', 'nurses', 'bicycle', 'tour', 'France', 'one', 'whom', 'missing', 'missing', 'girl', 'friend', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'hampered', 'language', 'barrier', 'sinister', 'uncooperative', 'locals', 'original', 'considered', 'something', 'minor', 'classic', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'came', 'remake', 'point', 'had', 'make', 'decision', 'Should', 'rent', 'remake', 'local', 'library', 'should', 'go', 'bit', 'additional', 'trouble', 'get', '1970', 'version', 'Well', 'chose', 'see', '1970', 'original', 'first', 'was', 'good', 'decision', 'am', 'here', 'STRONGLY', 'advise', 'do', 'same', 'two', 'reasons', '1', 'original', 'decent', ""n't"", '2', 'remake', 'seemed', 'be', 'aimed', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'original', 'anyway', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'trying', 'create', 'suspense', 'telegraphs', 'surprise', 'twists', 'so', 'blatantly', 'only', 'expecting', 'slavishly', 'faithful', 'remake', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', 'surprised', 'them.But', 'remake', 'also', 'bad', 'movie', 'own', 'terms', 'First', 'acting', 'three', 'American', 'leads', 'are', 'terrible', 'impossible', 'believe', 'characters', 'single', 'moment', 'word', 'gesture', 'facial', 'expression', 'Heard', 'especially', 'bad', 'acting', 'scene.Then', 'characterization', 'original', 'flirtier', 'two', 'girls', 'was', 'normal', 'healthy', 'young', 'woman', 'Here', 'Ellie', 'kind', 'deranged', 'freak', 'who', 'guy', 'Men', 'Room', 'stalls', 'door', 'open', 'then', 'up', 'conversation', 'urinal', 'What', 'point', ""'m"", 'supposed', 'be', 'scared', 'FOR', 'not', 'Heard', 'Stephanie', 'only', 'background', 'get', 'needy', 'doormat', 'moment', 'trouble', 'strikes', 'suddenly', 'Nancy', 'Drew', 'Action', 'Babe', 'attempt', 'original', 'make', 'audience', 'feel', 'situation', 'might', 'really', 'happen', 'have', 'female', 'lead', 'react', 'way', 'real', 'woman', 'situation', 'would', 'Karl', 'Urban', 'Enigmatic', 'Expatriate', 'character', 'just', 'randomly', 'what', 'script', 'rather', 'having', 'interior', 'consistency', 'projects', 'as', 'much', 'menace', 'turnip.The', 'plot', 'cookie-cutter', 'real', 'effort', 'amount', 'anything', 'failing', 'even', 'try', 'be', 'suspense', 'flick', 'being', 'action', 'film', 'bit', 'also', 'couple', 'torture', 'sexual', 'assault', 'scenes', 'are', 'tossed', 'exploitation', 'purposes', 'are', 'brief', 'Then', 'film', 'tries', 'being', 'girl-powered', 'bit', 'unconvincing.I', 'will', 'say', 'good', 'things', 'now', 'supporting', 'cast', 'solid', 'including', 'Adriana', 'Barraza', 'DRAG', 'ME', 'TO', 'HELL', 'landlady', 'One', 'settings', 'deserted', 'village', 'wonderfully', 'creepy', 'even', 'bright', 'sunlight', 'worthy', 'better', 'movie.Okay', 'are', 'looking', 'bad', 'movie', 'make', 'fun', 'definitely', 'see', 'original', 'first', 'movie', 'actually', 'closer', 'type', 'remake', 'infinitely', 'better', 'way', 'possible', 'would', 'be', 'RED', 'EYE', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'Cillian', 'Murphy', 'not', 'perfect', 'scary', 'good', 'fun', 'leads', 'can', 'act']",N/A

I mean here you got these freaking supermodels for Victoria's Secret traversing the Argentinian landscape without any sense of caution, restraint and situational awareness. They act like total hussies and as if they were still in the States hanging at the local bar. At night, they go to the only tavern in the village dressed like said VS models and one of them - Ellie - starts ferociously flirting with and teasing one of the guests, dancing seductively to ""I Touch Myself"".  Then she follows another one (Karl Urban) into the men's room, goes to the stall, sits down with the door open and then comes on to him while he's standing at the urinal. Who does that?If there was anything weird or shady going on in this town, the girls were like bull's eyes making themselves the target for it. Live bait.Aside from the stupidity of the characters, another main issue is that this movie relies a lot on eye candy and the hotness of the two main leads. No doubt, they are gorgeous, especially Amber Heard, but gorgeousness distracts from the acting and the story, not to mention that gorgeous racks cannot fill the gaping plot holes. Finally, Karl Urban's role was totally understated and  he appeared lost and as if he didnt know what to do with himself. I thought he would have a more prominent role but he was there in a merely supporting capacity and even then, whatever he was given to work with was flat.In the end, nothing is explained. We never find out why all this was done and how come the authorities in Buenos Aires were not notified when dozens of young women had gone missing, especially since some of those were Americans. It just ends. Anyway, this movie was so much formula that I didnt bother finishing the last 10 minutes and fast forwarded through it only to see it end exactly as predicted.So the only conclusion I can draw from this entertaining, quite suspenseful yet rather flat substance wise movie is that if you are going on a trip into some foreign land, dont act like a stupid floozie without common sense and situational awareness.",3,A Movie About How Stupid People Doing Stupid Things Get What They Deserve,1325462400,"01 2, 2012",2012,2395,"['Soon', 'Darkness', 'movie', 'two', 'girlfriends', 'riding', 'bikes', 'gorgeous', 'Argentinean', 'landscape', 'one', 'disappearing', 'small', 'village', 'other', 'one', 'frantic', 'search', 'her.I', 'must', 'say', 'really', 'hard', 'root', 'characters', 'act', 'so', 'stupidly', 'carelessly', 'two', 'were', 'mean', 'here', 'got', 'freaking', 'supermodels', 'Victoria', 'Secret', 'traversing', 'Argentinian', 'landscape', 'sense', 'caution', 'restraint', 'situational', 'awareness', 'act', 'total', 'hussies', 'were', 'still', 'States', 'hanging', 'local', 'bar', 'night', 'go', 'only', 'tavern', 'village', 'dressed', 'said', 'VS', 'models', 'one', 'Ellie', 'ferociously', 'flirting', 'teasing', 'one', 'guests', 'dancing', 'seductively', 'Touch', 'Then', 'one', 'Karl', 'Urban', 'men', 'room', 'stall', 'down', 'door', 'open', 'then', 'standing', 'urinal', 'Who', 'was', 'anything', 'weird', 'shady', 'going', 'town', 'girls', 'were', 'bull', 'eyes', 'making', 'target', 'Live', 'bait.Aside', 'stupidity', 'characters', 'main', 'issue', 'movie', 'lot', 'eye', 'candy', 'hotness', 'two', 'main', 'leads', 'doubt', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'especially', 'Amber', 'Heard', 'gorgeousness', 'distracts', 'acting', 'story', 'not', 'mention', 'gorgeous', 'racks', 'can', 'not', 'fill', 'gaping', 'plot', 'holes', 'Finally', 'Karl', 'Urban', 'role', 'was', 'totally', 'understated', 'appeared', 'lost', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'thought', 'would', 'have', 'more', 'prominent', 'role', 'was', 'there', 'merely', 'supporting', 'capacity', 'even', 'then', 'was', 'given', 'work', 'was', 'flat.In', 'end', 'nothing', 'explained', 'never', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'was', 'done', 'how', 'come', 'authorities', 'Buenos', 'Aires', 'were', 'not', 'notified', 'when', 'dozens', 'young', 'women', 'had', 'gone', 'missing', 'especially', 'were', 'Americans', 'just', 'Anyway', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'formula', 'didnt', 'bother', 'finishing', 'last', '10', 'minutes', 'fast', 'forwarded', 'only', 'see', 'end', 'exactly', 'predicted.So', 'only', 'conclusion', 'can', 'draw', 'entertaining', 'quite', 'suspenseful', 'yet', 'rather', 'flat', 'substance', 'wise', 'movie', 'are', 'going', 'trip', 'foreign', 'land', 'dont', 'act', 'stupid', 'floozie', 'common', 'sense', 'situational', 'awareness']",N/A

That picture dealt with two English girls on a bike trip through rural France.  In this new version, the girls are American and they are traveling via bicycle in rural Argentina.Actually, I think that that, as well as some of the girls' other actions, is a pretty stupid thing to do, but in the movies, characters tend to do stupid things.In any event, the girls have a spat, briefly part company and then one of them (Odette Yustman) disappears.  Her friend (Amber Heard) desperately tries to find her, but the town's one police officer is no help and she's not sure if she can trust the lone American (Karl Urban) there, who claims that his girl friend disappeared in this same area three months earlier.I've never seen the original version of AND SOON THE DARKNESS, so I can't really comment as to which might be better.

She is on screen for about 90% of this 91-minute psychological thriller. By far her most challenging role to date; she gets a lot of tight close-ups, a number of action sequences, and a character that is all over the map emotionally (must have been exhausting). The entire feature is told from her character's point-of-view (POV); and she does a good job of getting viewers to identify with her character.The Argentine scenery is spectacular, it is well shot ""on film not digital"", and the production design is excellent.  And if thin young women in abbreviated costumes (the entire wardrobe of Heard and her costar Odette Yustman could have been shipped down to Argentina in a large hatbox) is your idea of a good time you should seek this feature out immediately.On the other hand if you want to see the same story told in a manner that creates excitement and suspense, you should seek out the 1970 original (same title) which starred Pamela Franklin; a much better actress although not as naturally likeable as Heard and therefore her character is a little harder to identify with.  And the original was not burdened with a rushed production schedule that failed to get a lot of shots necessary to avoid a choppy feel, or maybe it just had a much better editor, or maybe the choppy look was intentional to give the thing a kind of off-kilter unity?Then again, what do I know?
