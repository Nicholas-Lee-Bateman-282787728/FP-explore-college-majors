564706,AZNNIVT2R0W0L,B0000524ET,T. Bostic,"[0, 0]","Its based on a TRUE story is the caption in the beginning of the film. And the story unfolds from there. It paints the perfect picture of just how CRUEL & EVIL ALOT of SOUTHERN ""WHITE PEOPLE"" were even to little black children during that time. The white people during that time in The SOUTH simply seemed to see black people as ""creatures"" dirty, filthy, nasty creatures. And it was a complete shame & disgrace! With the exception of a few ""good"" white people in this movie, white people just could not imagine their white children going to school with ""black children"" in the first place so for it to actually be happening during this time when the whole ""Brown Vs Board of Education"" had previously took place & school integration was mandated.1. There was the ""Little Rock NINE"" story where the 9 black students were chosen to attend an all white High School in Little Rock Arkansas. These nine students needed the MILITARY to escort them to school through out the entire day from the EVIL white kids and their equally IGNORANT RACIST parents.2. & then there was the story of little Ruby Bridges. The little black girl that had to endure the same cruel torment each & every grueling day being escorted to school also by security. White people took their kids out of school (kids missed ALOT of school), because they didnt want their white children in the same class as a little black girl. The little black girl wouldnt eat her lunch (shed hide the lunch in the class room & pour the juice in the glue bottle) because shed hear the white people say they were going to ""poison her""? How EVIL was that? REDICULOUS!Just imagine if you will being the mother or father of this sweet black little girl, having to go to this school each day & face this ANGRY mob of BIGOT white folks, who called her the most HATEFUL names, spit at her, one woman had a black doll with a rope around its neck held out as she walked by. Another day a white woman had a little black doll in a coffin. I mean My GOD! Black (african Americans) have come a very long way. The black people people who have came before us were very STRONG individuals, that literally placed their lives on the line & some have died, got beaten, water hosed down in the street like dogs, they were spit on. Just disrespected like animals. Not even animals deserve such horrific forms of cruelty. But they endured so much just for us to be able to sit where we want on a city bus (public transportation), drink from any water fountain we please. To use the same ""nice-clean"" rest rooms, as those mean evil white people.Every February (especially--since its black history month) I show my collection of Black History DVDs to my 11 year old daughter (since she was 8 years old) so that she can see & know the struggles black people had to face in their history. This way she can see why Barack Obama becoming the 44th president of the US was such an emotional moment for african Americans. She can understand also why Barack Obama becoming president is HISTORICAL. She saw the importance & POWER in VOTING is so important for black people today...my daughter knew of the 3 young men (1 black & 2 whites) who lost their lives in Mississipi fighting for black people to become first class citizens (Registered Voters), because of the DVD documenteries that we watched in previous years.These types of Documentaries, stories, & films, should be watched in the schools all over America. Black History is just as important as any other ""History"" if not more important. But since it paints such an UGLY face on the SOUTHERN White people of that time...with the KKK being heavily involved as well with the beatings, murders & lynchings of black & white people involved in the Civil Rights movement during that time. Alot of the young Generation doesnt know about Black History & what took place during that horrible & tragic time. Schools dont put enough FOCUS during February or any time of the school year on the History of Black people. & with our President being African American & really think its ashame. Sure its an UGLY History especially for the white people, but its the UGLY TRUTH that dates back to SLAVERY in America.AMERICA has a SERIOUSLY UGLY past, & it involves black people, & some good white people as well. More people should know about. If the schools are not teaching your kids this in History Class buy the DVDs and teach them on your own.",5,Its a tear jerker!

Ruby Bridges will inspire you to change your opinion on racism, and make you a better person. This little girl changed the world for people of color, only she didn't know it then. She entered the world of nasty white prejudice people, and stood her ground, thanks to the love of her parents, and her faith in God. She prayed daily as she walked up the stairs into her school, for God to forgive those closed minded people who mocked her on a daily basis. She overcame her fears, and stood strong. She wanted to make friends at her school, but the white parents wouldn't allow their children to mingle with her, she prayed for them too. In the end, she opened doors for all colored children, and has become an inspiration to hundreds of people. It's a great story too, about about a doctor who thought Ruby would lose it mentally, with all the pressures from taunting words she heard daily, but come to find out, he too, was prejudice, only he didn't realize it at first. He too, overcame his hate for blacks. I recommend this movie to all, young and old alike. I had my daughter take this to her Christian school to share with her second grade class on a rainy day, and they all loved it. It's perfect for Black History week at school.
