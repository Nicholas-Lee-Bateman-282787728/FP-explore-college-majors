With breathtaking camera angles and surprises at every turn, we get a whole new Bond.  Not to mention Daniel Craig who is easily one of the best Bonds since Sean Connery.  He isn't as suave as the former or Pierce Brosnan, but his cool, steely demeanor make him easily as confident and more to be reckoned with.  As one might expect, there are some sweaty hands dealt at an exotic gambling resort, but the urgency of terrorism meated out with card sharks for jihad funds and bomb threats give us a new urgency.  Certainly the tension ups the ante quite a bit.  Bond's new female sidekick, Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) has a mysterious allure, and the new Bond demonstrates a love interest--for a  sensitive side--to go with the lust of lush bikinis and evening gowns.  The softer side seems natural enough to provide a needed slow down to the plot and an increased interest from the female audience, but it's not enough to destroy the suave and witty nuances uttered from the coolest private eye ever conceived.  Co-written by Paul Haggis ('Million Dollar Baby' and 'Crash') the script is sharp and funny enough to increase the venue's hand and raise it quite a bit.  Satisfying to the last deal, 'Casino Royale' is a sure bet for moviegoers.",5,007 Deals a Bold New Hand,1164585600,"11 27, 2006",2006,1381,"['gymnastic', 'chase', 'scenes', 'new', 'James', 'Bond', 'film', 'Royale', 'are', 'so', 'stunning', 'find', 'needing', 'break', 'whole', 'game', 'breathtaking', 'camera', 'angles', 'surprises', 'turn', 'get', 'whole', 'new', 'Bond', 'Not', 'mention', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'who', 'easily', 'one', 'best', 'Bonds', 'Sean', 'Connery', ""n't"", 'as', 'suave', 'former', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'cool', 'steely', 'demeanor', 'make', 'easily', 'confident', 'more', 'be', 'reckoned', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'are', 'sweaty', 'hands', 'dealt', 'exotic', 'gambling', 'resort', 'urgency', 'terrorism', 'meated', 'out', 'card', 'sharks', 'jihad', 'funds', 'bomb', 'threats', 'give', 'new', 'urgency', 'Certainly', 'tension', 'ante', 'quite', 'bit', 'Bond', 'new', 'female', 'sidekick', 'Vesper', 'Lynd', 'Eva', 'Green', 'mysterious', 'allure', 'new', 'Bond', 'love', 'interest', 'sensitive', 'side', 'go', 'lust', 'lush', 'bikinis', 'evening', 'gowns', 'softer', 'side', 'natural', 'enough', 'provide', 'needed', 'slow', 'down', 'plot', 'increased', 'interest', 'female', 'audience', 'not', 'enough', 'destroy', 'suave', 'witty', 'nuances', 'uttered', 'coolest', 'private', 'eye', 'ever', 'conceived', 'Co-written', 'Paul', 'Haggis', 'Dollar', 'Baby', ""'Crash"", 'script', 'sharp', 'funny', 'enough', 'increase', 'venue', 'hand', 'raise', 'quite', 'bit', 'Satisfying', 'last', 'deal', 'Royale', 'sure', 'bet', 'moviegoers']",N/A
1048021,AKAWK5F9JZ2NQ,B000MNP2K8,"Aaron C. Wade ""Newsfop""","[12, 28]","When it comes to follow-ups to a Bond movie, one must understand the needed presence of some certain unalienable elements. One always makes use of the capacity to build upon the achievements of the previous film. With Casino Royale, a film that sets itself apart from the others due to the very nature of it being the first mission for James Bond, a Bond who is still green in the field and happens from time to time to be a bit sloppy, the creators managed to not only keep the preset elements, but give them some substance as to what they mean as well.Since the inception of the Bond film and its release back in 1962, the movie always began with a pair of tracing white dots following each other from left to right across a black screen. Once they reached the edge, the view through a gun barrel would pan in from the right following a well-dressed man walking in a plain white room. At the middle of the screen, the man in view turns and shoots straight ahead. Down pours a puddle of red blood, and the gun barrel wavers left and right.The gun barrel scene is iconic. It sets apart the entire canon of Bond films from the botched rehash attempts made. It was the brain child of an incredibly talented visual designer named Maurice Binder, and has been lovingly adopted and modified over the last 44 years.James Bond creator Ian Fleming made the impulsive mistake early on in his career to sell the rights to his first novel Casino Royale whereas he held onto the other novels until the arrival of Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman. The result was both an agitation and a hidden blessing.For years it was presumed that the movie Dr. No was Bond's first mission. It premiered in 1962 and portrayed a hardened Connery with a roguish panache and a smarmy self confidence that the world over has known to accept as the epitomic portrayal of James Bond. All fans of the novels know that Bond was not always perfectly in control though, and that flaw in temperament is evident in Casino Royale.A few years ago when Sony Pictures bought out MGM Studios, suddenly all the cards fell into place as it were. The long pined-for rights to Casino Royale had finally come back into focus along with the companies that owned the rest of James Bond, and so began a tiresome heated production of one of the greatest gambles in James Bond history.For starters, Sony Pictures is a giant in Hollywood that very much wants to make as much money as possible from anything it does. Therefore it felt that by milking the Bond machine for everything it had, they wanted to go nuts-to-the-door spectacular. Bond had become famous for its use of incredible gadgets, statuesque women and a fairly untarnished hero. Eon Productions, the company now in the hands of Broccoli's daughter Barbara and step-son Michael G. Wilson, wanted to take the less popular approach and show the hero in his early days . . . without the toys and the posh exterior.As for how the proceedings between Sony and Eon transpired, I don't know truly other than that Eon got what they wanted in the long haul. And by doing so, one of the most fan-shaking decisions came about. They needed a new Bond. Pierce Brosnan carried the mantle for seven years. He had played James Bond - 007 in four very-well received movies. He was by every means still popular in the eyes of the fans of the films, but mostly in the eyes of the young fans who only knew the franchise led by him. Letting Brosnan go was a decision that brought about wide-spread panic and endless speculation about ""The New Bond.""Then the name game began. Ewan MacGregor? Hugh Jackman? Clive Owen? Adrian Paul? Christian Bale? Web sites popped up like mushrooms after a hard rain. In particular was the rash of sites dedicated to the return of Pierce Brosnan. Many a fan, in my opinion, never took into account the notion that in Brosnan's last picture Die Another Day he was in his fifties and clearly showing signs of age in his face and in his hair. I'm just as much a fan of keeping along a talented actor, but the face needs to match the requirements of an ageless hero who moves with time itself.Production on the next Bond movie was quickly becoming the largest gap between films since the wait between Licence to Kill and GoldenEye. Two and a half years passed before Eon Productions came forward and finally announced that Casino Royale would indeed be the film to be made. It was then six months following that the company made it public to the world who the next man would be. And his name was Craig . . . Daniel Craig.Daniel Craig is an actor who bears little familiarity in the States. His greatest claims to fame were crime dramas in Britain. Only such pictures as Lara Croft: Tomb Raider and Layer Cake presented him to a small portion of film audiences in the USA, so his great reveal was understandably less than warmly received. But I prefer to remember history rather than let it fall to the wayside. Some 40 years ago when Cary Grant was an option to play Bond, the producers favored rather an unknown actor by the name of Sean Connery. It was a choice that even Bond creator Ian Fleming had serious doubts about. Just look how wrong everyone was.And now, 44 years later, just look how wrong everyone was again. Having the man who directed GoldenEye at the helm, Casino Royale was the first Bond film in history to both redefine and reinforce the strengths of the franchise. The world will realize that Daniel Craig is James Bond, no matter how rugged, untamed, temperamental, inexperienced and brash he comes off.And so we come back to the beginning. How does one reinforce the norms of such an old franchise while at the same time keeping it new? It goes into Fleming's description of what it takes for Bond to become 007. He needs two kills to his name. And so instead of starting the movie with the usual (and expected) gun barrel sequence, we instead get to see a black and white noir-ish scene interlaced with grainy black and white footage of a brutal conflict in a lavatory. We understand that these are to be Bond's first two kills. In a clever work of editing, we get to see the second kill before the first. Why? Because the first one ends with the view through a gun barrel of Bond standing against a white wall, he turns to face his opponent and fires one shot straight ahead. Crimson blood pours down the screen, and then we are treated to the opening titles.Elation comes in so many forms, but none so much as being gratified so much by something that has kept you bated for four years. The gun barrel is a mere sequence that hardly lasts more than 15 seconds at the most. Casino Royale's decision to make the audience work for it is one of the best decisions that I could ever hope for.The title sequence by Daniel Kleinman features psychedelic representations of silhouetted spies running amok amid lethal playing card and casino motifs. All is loosely matched to a subtle rock theme by Chris Cornell entitled ""You Know My Name."" It's a song that has the capacity to grow on someone after each listening. The titles also sustain and depart from the established norm. They contain silhouettes, which have become unanimous with the style of Maurice Binder. However a lack of any representation of the female form is seen, which lends it to more reminiscent of the opening title for Dr. No while also looking somewhat like the titles for Licence to Kill.The silhouettes are of Bond and several nameless assailants in various forms of combat while at the same time being pitted at the mercy of lethal playing card accents. We are also treated to a teaser image of the Bond girl when a gun sight crosses over a queen's face revealing Eva Green who plays Vesper Llynd. At first she is revealed from the queen of hearts, but the other end of her motif is that of the queen of spades, a clever method of foreshadowing a nuance to her character. The titles conclude with a slowly on-walking silhouette that transforms into Daniel Craig giving a cold stare, very much a serious and fierce take on his ageless character.The movie opens up onto a military camp in Uganda where we are first treated to the introduction of the film's villain Le Chiffre. He's a tall gaunt man bearing a familiar look to that of Peter Lorre (who played Le Chiffre in the 1954 inception of Casino Royale presented by the show Climax!) and a little bit of an evil Macaulay Culkin mixed in. This Le Chiffre has a few more tweaks though, a positive step toward making him look a bit more sinister. He has a scar over his left eye, he has a tear duct that cries blood and he habitually uses an inhaler. This man is the mathematically inclined banker and investor for several terrorist factions around the world.In the same locale, we find Bond on his first mission as a double-0. He's commanded by MI6 to capture a suspicious, and horribly burn-scarred, suspect named Mollaka. Things go awry when Bond's aide blows their cover causing the incredibly agile target to tear off into a construction site with Bond in hot pursuit. The target is chased up scaffolding, over a couple of cranes and back down again through a Nambutan embassy where 007 finally get his man. Upon seeking his escape, Bond uses his prisoner as a wrecking ball until he ends up in a courtyard surrounded by armed guards. With everything to lose, Bond takes the risk of swiping his prisoner's backpack, shooting him dead and blowing up a series of gas tanks allowing for his escape; all of which is caught on surveillance camera.It's a great achievement on the part of the film makers to let us believe completely that James Bond could die at any second despite us already knowing that he carries on to fulfill other missions. It's expert writing and directing, because I was constantly on edge wondering if this will be the one that finally ends the life of 007. But it's also more than that. There are instances of other movies with spies in them that look to copy what James Bond has done, coming never so close as to the grandeur and originality of what Fleming and Eon came up with.The resulting mayhem causes 007 to make headlines as a murdering spy, turning MI6 into the laughing stock of London. M, played once again by Judi Dench, throws a considerable fit when she learns about Bond's failure and code violations. She becomes even more surprised to find that he's broken into her home to find him casually browsing through a suspect database on her laptop.Film consistency continues with this remarkably hilarious scene. It shows that an untamed Bond is even more prone to insubordination that he would be as a tenured member of the secret service. The only reason he ever gets away with anything he does is because he's so good at his job, which his superiors constantly find themselves conflicted over. Bond's free thinking and unconventionality rob the straight-laced affiliates of prestige and success. Anyone else who violates a direct order or international code would face serious consequences. The apex of Bond's punishment though is nothing more than a terse reprimand.Following the suggestion of M, Bond looks to keep himself out of the public eye (if only for a brief moment). He travels to Nassau based on a lead found from the material he swiped from the bomb maker he assassinated. His nonchalant meandering allows him the opportunity to fake his identity as a valet driver, and create a tremendous ruckus in the parking lot sending the entire security staff of a high-end hotel to investigate, thus leaving the surveillance office vacant and open for Bond's perusing leisure.What makes me the most jealous of James Bond is his immaculate skill and grace in wandering about in places he doesn't belong. Not only does he do it with such stealth, but he's cocky about it too. Every environment becomes his playground the instant he steps into it.While placing occupancy for a room in the hotel, he cleverly manufactures a charismatic lie to gain knowledge of the subject he witnessed in the surveillance office. His charm of course is placed on that of a lovely blonde woman, the easiest target for 007 to interrogate without making his efforts seem like an interrogation. After he finds out what he needs, he manages to successfully track the man, Dimitrious, down, beat him on a whim at a game of Texas Hold'em, win his gorgeous Aston Martin and seduce his smoldering Latin wife Solange.In a surprising turn of events though, Solange is abandoned with only a bottle of Bollinger to keep her company as Bond whisks away to a Miami airport in an attempt to find what her husband is up to. They meet up in a crowded terminal where they share wicked stares and a fierce yet silent knife fight. Bond comes out the winner, and the loser of the battle waits out the rest of his time on screen unnoticed.In the scuffle though, Bond loses track of the materials that he saw the man place in the terminal for the next contact to take up and carry out the terror plot. But with skillful use of ingenuity, 007 uses his last victim's phone to call up the next target in a crowd. Bond finds his guy and continues pursuit. The situation escalates when the man being followed puts himself behind a locked door. Bond calls up MI6 seeking assistance only to be met with smarmy bureaucracy. His quickly detailed explanation soon puts them into motive panic however just in time for Bond to realize he didn't need their help at all.As is common with 007 films of the past, ridiculously exciting action set pieces materialize in unlikely places. This one shows no weakness or fatigue. Bond and an the intimidating terrorist play fisticuffs in the front seat of a fuel truck rocketing across the tarmac toward a prototype jetliner that our main villain Le Chiffre is counting on going up in flames so that he can make a killing on the stock market. Unbeknownst to him though, our man Bond comes through in a clench, putting him at a serious financial disadvantage.Thus the first act concludes with M not so much apologizing to Bond for having a higher sense of what he was up to than anyone thought, but rather a commendation for strength of character. After all, if M were to ever thank 007, it would only be spoken in sarcasm.Le Chiffre organizes a high stakes poker game at the title location in Montenegro to win back everything that he lost on the non-disaster. With great reluctance, James Bond is staked in the game by M, only because he's the best card player in the service.For grand entrances of the famed Bond girls of old, this film seems to shift that stock to the lesser of the two. Solange was introduced riding a valiant steed across the beach. In the case of Bond's biggest crush though, treasury executive Vesper Llynd just sort of shows up and drops into a seat in front of James and announces, ""I'm the money.""Bond retorts, ""Every penny of it."" (That's the only hint of Moneypenny in this movie; maybe in Bond 22 we'll see the real deal.)What is surprising about this film (apart from other new things) is that Vesper's character is much more rounded out and multidimensional than the usual heroine. This is a woman that laughs, cries, sulks, seethes, screams and seduces. She has the same amount of dynamic that Diana Rigg did when she played the woman to be James' wife in On Her Majesty's Secret Service.Perhaps in the process of getting caught up on the reverie of finally seeing my favorite film hero on the screen again I neglected to mention that the scenery and cinematography of this movie surpass even the greatest of installments in the anthology. The vistas are absolutely breathtaking. It qualifies as being one of the films in which the places that James goes are places I would desperately like to visit some day.Casino Royale then steam rolls into the segment of the film which I refer to as the Fleming section. It's the content that was ultimately pried from the pages of Ian Fleming's first Bond novel. With the timely adjustments to fit the modern age, it plays out like an impressive cat and mouse game of high stakes gambling.A sudden shift in the momentum is a dangerous calculation, but I'm slightly biased in this endeavor. I like Bond more for the subtleties in his character and the fancy quirks he uses to really upend others. One charming example is his disruption of the game to have a waiter bring what becomes his infamous Vodka Martini, shaken not stirred.The director is wise though to not simply hash out a half-hour long poker game on the screen. Select cuts and recesses are installed to keep tempo moving. We have instances where Bond is actually forced to look after the villain and make sure he doesn't get ousted before the end of the game. A number of terrorists show up unannounced and voice their concern over Le Chiffre's ability to return their money that he lost.Bond exercises his savage brutality as Vesper looks on in complete disbelief. A chilling shower scene later on builds credit to her character's inexperience in the film. We also get to see Bond for the first time in a great while in a truly perilous situation having much to do with his famous beverage. For a movie to make you believe that James Bond could die on his first mission is phenomenal storytelling.The climactic scene at the poker table is heavily rewarding after all the drama that ensued with Bond going for broke, losing everything then being graciously reentered through the help of a long time (first time met) friend Felix Leiter. Aficionados of the game with balk at his highly improbable finish, but to them I give the middle finger and a smug, ""Good day to you."" It's a Bond movie. Stuff like that is supposed to happen.To celebrate his grand victory, Bond and Vesper have dinner alone in Casino Royale's dining room. The elation is short lived with she steps away briefly only to be kidnapped. In pursuit of his lovely, Bond manages to accomplish one of the most heartbreaking of exploits . . . he murders his Aston Martin. To make matters worse, he gets kidnapped afterwards too.What follows next is the scene that I feared to see because of the contextual nature of it. Like never before seen, Bond is brutally tortured. But like I had never seen before in my life, it became one of the most visceral and yet hilarious things I had ever witnessed. To merely explain it would do such great injustice.Beyond the climactic turnout of that scene, we come to the slow-roving finale in which the story twists when you don't expect it to. Bond falls in love with Vesper but soon finds himself once again caught off guard. And like no Bond before, it actually sets itself up for a sequel.Now what was that name again? Ian Fleming took the name James Bond from a book called Birds of the West Indies. It just so happened to be the name of the author. He chose the name because it had no great importance or attitude about it. It was just a name. Yet from mediocrity came something internationally famous.It all began in a casino in London in the movie Dr. No. A non-descript man sits at a table playing baccarat. His face goes unseen. Across from him is a dark haired woman in a red dress. As the hand proceeds, he ends up beating her. She has an understandable look of irritation on her face. The man says to her as she's writing out her check for more money to stay in the game, ""I admire your courage, Miss . . .""""Trench,"" she replies. She looks up at him and adds, ""Sylvia Trench."" She then says to him, ""I admire your luck, Mr. . .""We then finally get to see his face as he slowly lights a cigarette in his mouth and replies, ""Bond,"" and then mockingly adds, ""James Bond.""In its inception, Bond, James Bond was meant only as a joke. When Guy Hamilton directed Goldfinger, the film that is commonly referred to as the one that set the Bond formula, the introduction was used again. The film to follow was Thunderball, the highest adjusted grossing Bond movie of all time. It was both an expansion on the Bond formula as well as a fist against all the critics who never liked Goldfinger, and the fist takes its form in the guise of a femme fatale who ridicules Bond for his playboy nature. She is the one to call him by the name ""Mr. Bond, James Bond."" And so from then on, in every film following the character of Bond always introduced himself that way at least once.So what has become a tradition is surprisingly the greatest pay off in Casino Royale. With all the remarkable set pieces, action sequences, dramatic diversions and dreamy locales we get the famous introduction as the very last piece of dialogue in the movie.Following through the end credits the words ""James Bond Will Return"" roll up from the bottom. A great sense of apprehension and relief consumes me. It means that I will get to see a great actor return to play Bond again . . . in two year's time.I know exactly what I'll be doing on November 7th, 2008.",5,The longest review of Casino Royale you're

1048023,AUDWCQXIG0QZG,B000MNP2K8,abettertomorrow,"[4, 9]","Like many other Bond fans, I genuinely enjoyed the Brosnan films...up until the second half of Die Another Day.  Goldeneye and it's slick, underrated follow-up Tomorrow Never Dies are modern Bond classics in my opinion, and The World Is Not Enough is consistently interesting when things aren't randomly exploding.  However, an invincible Bond was getting tiresome, and in these more cynical days, Bond fans needed a return to Ian Fleming's dark, somewhat sociopathic protagonist.Although the realistic but generally dull Jason Bourne and the silly, over-the-top Jack Bauer managed to steal some of Bond's thunder in the past few years, the makers of Casino Royale stopped these rather temporary franchises dead in their tracks.Martin Campbell, Paul Haggis, and the Purvis-Wade combo have created a flim that is both new and old.  It's new in that it shows us the edgier, harder side of Bond that fans haven't seen since Dalton's performance in Licence to Kill.  It also gives fans a taste of the nihilism and narcissism that surrounded Bond's character in Ian Fleming's novels.  It's old because the film harkens back to the classic Connery films, with lush cinematography, a bold musical score, and some truly spectacular action sequences.Then there's Daniel Craig himself.  While it may not be the most familiar or accessible Bond performance (that honor goes to Connery in From Russia With Love), it is in my opinion the overall best.  Physically and psychologically, Craig transforms himself into the iconic British agent and brilliantly handles both the action sequences and the quieter moments of contemplation and dialogue.Overall, Casino Royale achieved the impossible and reinvigorated a franchise that's nearly half a century old.  I just hope that the follow-up is as inspired and competently-handled as this was.",5,One of the best.,1181174400,"06 7, 2007",2007,1825,"['many', 'other', 'Bond', 'fans', 'genuinely', 'enjoyed', 'Brosnan', 'films', 'up', 'second', 'half', 'Die', 'Day', 'Goldeneye', 'slick', 'underrated', 'follow-up', 'Tomorrow', 'Never', 'Dies', 'are', 'modern', 'Bond', 'classics', 'opinion', 'World', 'Not', 'Enough', 'consistently', 'interesting', 'when', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'randomly', 'exploding', 'However', 'invincible', 'Bond', 'was', 'getting', 'tiresome', 'more', 'cynical', 'days', 'Bond', 'fans', 'needed', 'return', 'Ian', 'Fleming', 'dark', 'somewhat', 'sociopathic', 'realistic', 'generally', 'dull', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'silly', 'over-the-top', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'managed', 'steal', 'Bond', 'thunder', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'makers', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'stopped', 'rather', 'temporary', 'franchises', 'dead', 'tracks.Martin', 'Campbell', 'Paul', 'Haggis', 'Purvis-Wade', 'combo', 'have', 'created', 'flim', 'new', 'old', 'new', 'edgier', 'harder', 'side', 'Bond', 'fans', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Dalton', 'performance', 'Licence', 'Kill', 'also', 'fans', 'taste', 'nihilism', 'narcissism', 'surrounded', 'Bond', 'character', 'Ian', 'Fleming', 'novels', 'old', 'film', 'back', 'classic', 'Connery', 'films', 'lush', 'cinematography', 'bold', 'musical', 'score', 'truly', 'spectacular', 'action', 'sequences.Then', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'most', 'familiar', 'accessible', 'Bond', 'performance', 'honor', 'Connery', 'From', 'Russia', 'Love', 'opinion', 'overall', 'best', 'Physically', 'psychologically', 'Craig', 'iconic', 'British', 'agent', 'brilliantly', 'action', 'sequences', 'quieter', 'moments', 'contemplation', 'dialogue.Overall', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'achieved', 'impossible', 'reinvigorated', 'franchise', 'nearly', 'century', 'old', 'just', 'hope', 'follow-up', 'inspired', 'competently-handled', 'was']",N/A

[No doubling considered?] In Uganda we see suitcases filled with money - for a safe investment. In Madagascar a man is chased to a construction site, and ends in an embassy. Will such actions be repeated? The code word is ""Ellipsis"". Bond uses high-tech methods to gain information from a cellular phone. Can `M' trust Bond? He needs a vacation. [Note the informal dress compared to earlier decades.] Bond uses a ruse to get the name of a car owner. Who is Mr. Demetrious? Bond wins big at cards. A telephone call sends Bond to Miami. A bag is switched, and this leads to more action with a fuel truck. Bond prevents a disaster at the airport. Shorting stocks after 9/11 made a fortune for a few.On the train to Montenegro Bond gets his cash. Vesper Lynd brings the message, and they match their wits. Later there is a high stakes card game. During a break there is a lot of action. Back at the table Le Chiffre wins big. Did Bond lose because of his ego? An ally advances fund to Bond. But another drink is too much. A phone call brings help. Vesper arrives in time. Bond is back in the game. Fortune smiles on Bond - a straight flush! Le Chiffre has lost all. There is a car chase in the night, and a crash. Bond is captured and tortured in a gross scene. Wil he give up the password? Will Bond be saved? Who will be next? Then Bond and Vesper spend time on the beach. How long will that last? Is there a problem with the funds on deposit? There is exciting action that causes a house to collapse into the waters of Venice. The last scenes wrap up the loose ends. Is there a last message for Bond?The film was changed a lot from the original novel, which was simpler and better. The old theme song is repeated when they roll the credits. There was a lot of product placement. This film has the most acrobatic James Bond; was it CGI? The script seems slower than the classic films from the 1960s. I think this film has an over-complicated plot with too many scenes. It has one educational part when it shows how a ""heart attack"" can be created.

1048027,A2OZBJ58CML9OS,B000MNP2K8,A. Gammill,"[8, 12]","Talk about beating the odds.  Twenty-one films and some forty-four years into cinema's longest-running franchise, the Bond filmmakers have managed to redefine the character with resounding success.  In fact, as of this writing, Casino Royale is the highest-grossing 007 adventure ever.I've seen them all, and I've always held onto the belief that Connery IS and ALWAYS WILL BE James Bond.  But Daniel Craig almost made me forget Connery completely!  Oh sure, the early Connery films are still great fun, and the sheer nostalgia of his era can't really be ignored.  But THIS is Ian Fleming's James Bond the way he was meant to be: Cold as ice, infused with lethal cunning and nerves of steel.The real fun (and the real payoff for longtime fans) is watching how the writers, and Craig, slowly ""create"" Bond for the audience.  [SPOILERS AHEAD] There's no Q branch, no Miss Moneypenny, almost no gadgets and precious few glib one-liners.  But all the things that fans would come to love about the character are subtely laid out in the course of nearly 2 1/2 hours.  And if that sounds like a long time, you obviously haven't seen the movie yet.  Second-time director Martin Campbell (of Goldeneye, in which Bond was recreated in the person of Pierce Brosnan) piles on the action from the outset.  The construction-scene chase alone packs in more mind-blowing action in 10 minutes most movies manage in two hours.  And the scene that could have, in lesser hands, brought the action to a grinding halt (the poker game) actually provides some of the film's greatest thrills.Two minor quibbles that probably won't matter to casual fans: Considering this is a 2-disc set with many extras, why is there no trailer for the film?  We get trailers for Spider-man 3, Rocky Balboa, The Pursuit of Happyness and others, but not Casino Royale?  And I wish MGM/Columbia would have maintained the same package design as the previous Bond films, just so this one won't look kinda odd on the shelf next to my 20 other 007 adventures.  But again, minor complaints.Even if you're not a James Bond fan, give this one a try.  It's easily the best action film of 2006.

I admit some jokes were very good (I thought Bond's comment on vodka/martini in the bar was hilarious) and practically every scene with Judy Dench was great.Madds Mikkelsen as Le Chiffre was not bad, though personally I think he had tonns of quiet menace as Tristan in King Arthur - where he looked much more dangerous than in this movie.Craig was slightly better than initially expected but he lacks charm, charisma, humour and wit that is traditionally linked with Bond's role. I remember watching the movie and having a funny thought that it was quite obvious why Lara Croft dropped her boyfriend (Craig played Lara's former boyfriend in the first Croft movie - and she had to save the looser at the end).I hated the absence of logic in actions and characters. The best example is the first chase where Bond shouts to his associate not to shoot the guy running away as he needs him alive. He them proceeds to chase him all over the place, creates a major diplomatic incident and then shoots the guy himself. If he needed to pick up some items from the dead man (as it is shown) it would have been considerably more logical to shoot him in the very beginning and same himself some heavy running.Same with characters. The best way for the girl in the movie would have been to tell Bond everything and get his cooperation. But that would have been out of the type for a femme fatale (who does not have much use for brains, obviously).What I definitely did not like was all the teary-bleary love story that clogged the plot so much that at moments all action stopped to permit another soul-wrenching conversation with Eva Green's heroine. Being a woman myself, I suppose I should have loved the soppy interludes but they were way too pathetic. When the heroine looks tragic all the time in all circumstances, it is really difficult to feel anything for her when the tragedy finally happens.In fact all the sentimentality and wooden acting is the reason I give the movie no more than 3 stars. Have been watching Bond movies for years and I simply do not feel like a ""New Age"" sensitive Bond with a broken heart or a Bond without humor and charisma.I shudder at the thought that I now have to wait 10 (20?) years for Craig to be replaced with somebody more ""bondish"".

Until this came along, I had written the franchise off.  But I enjoyed this so much, I didn't mind buying it twice, first on DVD, then later upgrading toCasino Royale [Blu-ray].  The hi-def picture was absolutely phenomenal, and whenever I want to impress upon someone the difference Blu-ray makes, I pull this one out as the demo.  From the retro grainy black-&-white introduction, thru sunny tropical locations, to the darker European countryside and luxurious interiors, a full range of textures and tones is sampled, making this engrossing story beautiful to look at, something to savor over multiple viewings.  Daniel Craig's powerful performance makes it all the sweeter.Selecting the actor to play Fleming's iconic character is Hollywood's equivalent to the Vatican picking a new pope.  In the limbo between films, the people gather and wait.  When the studio finally announced amidst the usual &eacute;clat that Craig had been chosen to fill the tuxedo, the surprising selection was a signal that something major was going down.  It was a ballsy break with tradition, and it paid off.  Craig owned that part, and his Bond will be what future generations will compare his successors to. Of course it helped that he had a topnotch script, which hews closer to the novel than any Bond film since aroundFrom Russia with Love, after which they became increasingly distracted with silly gadgets (exceptingOn Her Majesty's Secret Service).  The stuff about the footrace and the tanker at the airport were added, along with the stuff on the boat with Vesper in the epilogue.  But the salient points of the rest of the story have some basis in the novel.  It distinguishes itself further with its emotional detail, beginning with a pre-credit sequence marked with a psychological gamesmanship that was maintained on some level throughout the rest of the film.  It's tightly crafted, wasting nothing, slamming into Chris Cornell's ""You Know My Name"" through the barrel of the trademark gunshot and swirl, then moving through the locales, hewn seamlessly through great editing and strong musical cues of variations of the theme.  The pacing gives the story enough time to breath, but never lingers.  It flows.

And, after Pierce Brosnan did a horrible job (in my opinion) at being Bond, I didn't ever think I would be one.But, then here come Daniel Craig. Pretty much being the best Bond, in my opinion. Yes, there was Sean Connery, but for my generation, Craig = Bond.In this re-telling of Bond's beginnings as a 00 agent, we get a naive, daring, and egocentric Bond that will stop at nothing to get the bad guy, and the girl. I loved the storyline, how it unfolded, and how it was expertly told. Craig, along with Eva Green, do an excellent job of selling the plot and reeling you in. The action is top-notch and Craig looks like he's been Bond all along.My only rant is the sequence when Bond and Vesper go off on vacation. I understand that it sets up the last scenes of the movie, bu they were a bit pretentious to me.However, if you are a Bond fan, this will definately get you into the series again.

1048047,AQUVTQFFXP4AC,B000MNP2K8,"Andariel Halo ""Disillusioned Smark""","[5, 10]","***Spoiler Alert***In the same lane as Batman Begins, where a franchise that has sucked starts prequeling to rejuvenate itself, I didn't expect much from Casino Royale but a rolicking action flick not really worth much more than an action flick.Casino Royale blew me away, and I think it is the greatest Bond movie since the likes of Goldeneye, Goldfinger, Moonraker, Dr No, etc.The best thing about this Bond that I loved, was that Bond was HUMAN.  As opposed to the super sophisticated suave man with only two emotional settings---uptightly angry and erotically romantic---or as M so elegantly labeled him in Goldeneye ""...a sexist, misogynist dinosaur. A relic of the Cold War, who's boyish charms, though wasted on me, obviously appealed to the young lady I sent out to evaluate you.""  This Bond was HUMAN.  He got very angry, and lost his temper, and as a result failed his mission and nearly lost his job.  He fell in love, and quit his job to stay with the girl.  He comforted the girl when she freaked out at seeing him kill two men.  He cried when the girl died.  He was smug when the man he was chasing finally got his due.Daniel Craig isn't the most good-looking Bond (he's quite grotesquely rugged in my opinion), but he strikes a perfect balance between rough-and-tumble and suave and sophisticated.  He's much more sophisticated from the old one-dimensional Bond we've seen in the likes of Die Another Day.  Even the villain, Le Chiffre, has more depth than just ""Before I kill you, Meestur Bond, I will tell you exactly how I plan on executing my evil plan...""Le Chiffre's diabolical schemes go beyond the typical ""hold someone hostage, make lots of money, take over the world"".  This time, the villain is in trouble: he's been taking African warlords' money and holding on to it and using it in gambling, and stock market investings against a prototype airplane's success.  He even hires a man to make sure the plane fails by planting an explosive on it.  After Bond foils this plot, he's in big trouble, and stakes it all on a high-stakes Texas Hold-em poker game at Casino Royale.  Imagine seeing Bond's top villain fearing for his life as African agents threaten to cut his girlfriend's arm off if he doesn't get them their money.While there's plenty of action and violence, including a spellbinding scene in Africa with Bond chasing an African agent through a construction site, hundreds of feet in the air atop a crane, and into an embassy building, the core of the drama actually resides in the great poker game at Casino Royale.  If Bond wins, he wins 150 million dollars and foils the Le Chiffre's plans.  If he loses, his 10 to 15 million dollar investment goes to help fund terrorism.The dialogue is surprisingly ripe as opposed to the endless string of stale and childish sexual innuendos polluting the last movie's dialogue, and there are plenty of witty lines (""That last hand... nearly killed me"" after having to leave the poker game when Le Chiffre poisons his drink, or ""Do I look like I give a damn?"" when asked if he'd like his martini shaken or stirred.)While there's a confusing moment where Bond is betrayed by his contact at Casino Royale, Mathis, and then he ends up in a hospital where Mathis is then betrayed, it all makes sense eventually, and the ends are even neatly tied up when the girl Bond's fallen in love with dies and he returns to his work, much colder now, and leaving the door open for some sequels.  While I know this isn't the first movie Bond's fallen in love in (GoldenEye is one I know of), this is the first one where you felt the chemistry was there.All in all, it was a great new beginning for the franchise, and nicely gritty and sophisticated all at once.",5,"Bond is back, and this time, he's human...",1172793600,"03 2, 2007",2007,3719,"['***Spoiler', 'Alert***In', 'same', 'lane', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'where', 'franchise', 'sucked', 'starts', 'prequeling', 'rejuvenate', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'rolicking', 'action', 'flick', 'not', 'really', 'worth', 'much', 'more', 'action', 'flick.Casino', 'Royale', 'blew', 'away', 'think', 'greatest', 'Bond', 'movie', 'likes', 'Goldeneye', 'Goldfinger', 'Moonraker', 'Dr', 'No', 'etc.The', 'best', 'thing', 'Bond', 'loved', 'was', 'Bond', 'was', 'HUMAN', 'opposed', 'super', 'sophisticated', 'suave', 'man', 'only', 'two', 'emotional', 'settings', '-uptightly', 'angry', 'erotically', 'romantic', 'M', 'so', 'elegantly', 'labeled', 'Goldeneye', 'sexist', 'misogynist', 'dinosaur', 'relic', 'Cold', 'War', 'who', 'boyish', 'charms', 'though', 'wasted', 'obviously', 'appealed', 'young', 'lady', 'sent', 'out', 'evaluate', 'Bond', 'was', 'HUMAN', 'got', 'very', 'angry', 'lost', 'temper', 'result', 'failed', 'mission', 'nearly', 'lost', 'job', 'fell', 'love', 'quit', 'job', 'stay', 'girl', 'comforted', 'girl', 'when', 'freaked', 'out', 'seeing', 'kill', 'two', 'men', 'cried', 'when', 'girl', 'died', 'was', 'smug', 'when', 'man', 'was', 'chasing', 'finally', 'got', 'due.Daniel', 'Craig', ""n't"", 'most', 'good-looking', 'Bond', 'quite', 'grotesquely', 'rugged', 'opinion', 'perfect', 'balance', 'rough-and-tumble', 'suave', 'sophisticated', 'much', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'old', 'one-dimensional', 'Bond', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'likes', 'Die', 'Day', 'Even', 'villain', 'Le', 'Chiffre', 'more', 'depth', 'just', 'kill', 'Meestur', 'Bond', 'will', 'tell', 'exactly', 'how', 'plan', 'executing', 'evil', 'plan', 'Le', 'Chiffre', 'diabolical', 'schemes', 'go', 'typical', 'hold', 'someone', 'hostage', 'make', 'lots', 'money', 'take', 'world', 'time', 'villain', 'trouble', 'been', 'taking', 'African', 'warlords', 'money', 'holding', 'using', 'gambling', 'stock', 'market', 'investings', 'prototype', 'airplane', 'success', 'even', 'man', 'make', 'sure', 'plane', 'fails', 'planting', 'explosive', 'Bond', 'foils', 'plot', 'big', 'trouble', 'stakes', 'high-stakes', 'Texas', 'Hold-em', 'poker', 'game', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'Imagine', 'seeing', 'Bond', 'top', 'villain', 'fearing', 'life', 'African', 'agents', 'threaten', 'cut', 'girlfriend', 'arm', ""n't"", 'get', 'money.While', 'plenty', 'action', 'violence', 'including', 'spellbinding', 'scene', 'Africa', 'Bond', 'chasing', 'African', 'agent', 'construction', 'site', 'hundreds', 'feet', 'air', 'crane', 'embassy', 'building', 'core', 'drama', 'actually', 'great', 'poker', 'game', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'Bond', 'wins', '150', 'million', 'dollars', 'Le', 'Chiffre', 'plans', '10', '15', 'million', 'dollar', 'investment', 'help', 'fund', 'terrorism.The', 'dialogue', 'surprisingly', 'ripe', 'opposed', 'endless', 'string', 'stale', 'childish', 'sexual', 'innuendos', 'polluting', 'last', 'movie', 'dialogue', 'are', 'plenty', 'witty', 'lines', 'last', 'hand', 'nearly', 'killed', 'having', 'leave', 'poker', 'game', 'when', 'Le', 'Chiffre', 'drink', 'Do', 'look', 'give', 'damn', 'when', 'asked', ""'d"", 'like', 'martini', 'shaken', 'stirred', 'confusing', 'moment', 'where', 'Bond', 'betrayed', 'contact', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'Mathis', 'then', 'up', 'hospital', 'where', 'Mathis', 'then', 'betrayed', 'sense', 'eventually', 'ends', 'are', 'even', 'neatly', 'tied', 'up', 'when', 'girl', 'Bond', 'fallen', 'love', 'dies', 'work', 'much', 'colder', 'now', 'leaving', 'door', 'open', 'sequels', 'know', ""n't"", 'first', 'movie', 'Bond', 'fallen', 'love', 'GoldenEye', 'one', 'know', 'first', 'one', 'where', 'felt', 'chemistry', 'was', 'there.All', 'was', 'great', 'new', 'beginning', 'franchise', 'nicely', 'gritty', 'sophisticated', 'once']",N/A

It's funny because when a film receives so much attention prior to its opening it is usually a bad thing, but when the only attention the film is receiving is the mixed words over the color of the lead actors hair, well then you have to take into consideration that know one knows anything yet.  Daniel Craig is blond, yes, but he is also the best Bond in the series, seriously.  He's dark, mysterious, charming, handsome, buff, bright and just about the best thing that has ever happened to the spy thriller.In `Casino Royale' we meet Bond for the first time.  In the opening scenes he's earning his 00 status which means he has to make two kills, which he does in a very violent and gritty fashion.  What `Casino Royale' was able to do, by starting at the beginning, was establish Bond all over again, recreate his character to be more palatable.  We are able to reexamine his charm and his pride.  The Bond represented here is a bit softer, not as callused as those in the previous films because it is this film that defines Bond, that molds him into the man he is today.The film was smart in the way it handled the adaptation from the Ian Fleming novel by building up to the poker scenes as apposed to consisting mainly of them.  The novel read a little slow but the film is so fast paced and intense it's brutally good.  Aside from the action sequences (which are all phenomenal) it works very hard to make each and every character real to the audience, most notably Bond and his partner Vesper Lynd.  This is due to the brilliant performances by both Daniel Craig and Eva Green.  Daniel reinvents Bond beautifully and I'm sure will continue to develop him as the franchise takes off.  Eva Green is just utterly flawless here, breathing so much life in Vesper.  She is by far the most mature and well rounded Bond-Girl to ever grace the screen and she deserves major credit for giving the film a sense of warmth and reality.  The other performances are also well placed, especially that of Judi Dench who reprises her role as M.What I admire about this film is its ability to prove superior to the rest in its genre.  There are so many action/thriller type films but rarely do they ever reach this magnitude, this level of perfection.  The action scenes are flawless, the acting is award worthy, the script is tight and coherent, the set pieces are brilliant designed and the direction is astonishing.  In fact I can't pick out a single flaw.  Even my wife, who I literally had to drag to the theater, loved this movie.  In fact she made me take her back to see it a second time and insisted we purchase it the minute it was released on DVD.As far as the DVD is concerned, the extras are worth the price of the disc.  The behind the scenes featurette with Daniel Craig discussing his training for the film and such is a great extra, one that is entertaining and worth watching.  It's funny because it's rare that the extras on these DVD's ever really interest me, but I must say that I watched these and enjoyed them immensely.So, bottom line is that `Casino Royale' quite frankly may be the best Bond movie yet.  It's certainly the most polished and entertaining since the days when Sean Connery carried the title.  Many were skeptical of Craig's ability to pull this off but I'm here to say that Daniel Craig is better than any Bond so far in his ability to not only carry out the amazing stunts involved but also make this character real to us for the first time, making Bond someone we understand and admire.",5,Surpasses all expectations and succeeds in blowing the audience away...,1193875200,"11 1, 2007",2007,3746,"['ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'good', 'was', 'saw', 'trailer', 'just', 'knew', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'blow', 'away', 'opening', 'gritty', 'black', 'white', 'introduction', 'climax', 'was', 'cinematic', 'heaven', 'funny', 'when', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'attention', 'prior', 'opening', 'usually', 'bad', 'thing', 'when', 'only', 'attention', 'film', 'receiving', 'mixed', 'words', 'color', 'lead', 'actors', 'hair', 'well', 'then', 'have', 'take', 'consideration', 'know', 'one', 'anything', 'yet', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'blond', 'yes', 'also', 'best', 'Bond', 'series', 'seriously', 'dark', 'mysterious', 'charming', 'handsome', 'buff', 'bright', 'just', 'best', 'thing', 'ever', 'happened', 'spy', 'thriller.In', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'meet', 'Bond', 'first', 'time', 'opening', 'earning', '00', 'status', 'make', 'two', 'kills', 'very', 'violent', 'gritty', 'fashion', 'What', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'was', 'able', 'do', 'starting', 'beginning', 'was', 'establish', 'Bond', 'over', 'again', 'recreate', 'character', 'be', 'more', 'palatable', 'are', 'able', 'reexamine', 'charm', 'pride', 'Bond', 'represented', 'here', 'bit', 'softer', 'not', 'as', 'callused', 'previous', 'films', 'film', 'Bond', 'man', 'today.The', 'film', 'was', 'smart', 'way', 'handled', 'adaptation', 'Ian', 'Fleming', 'novel', 'building', 'up', 'poker', 'as', 'apposed', 'consisting', 'mainly', 'novel', 'read', 'little', 'slow', 'film', 'so', 'fast', 'paced', 'intense', 'brutally', 'good', 'Aside', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'phenomenal', 'very', 'hard', 'make', 'character', 'real', 'audience', 'most', 'notably', 'Bond', 'partner', 'Vesper', 'Lynd', 'due', 'brilliant', 'performances', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'Eva', 'Green', 'Daniel', 'Bond', 'beautifully', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'continue', 'develop', 'franchise', 'off', 'Eva', 'Green', 'just', 'utterly', 'flawless', 'here', 'breathing', 'so', 'much', 'life', 'Vesper', 'far', 'most', 'mature', 'well', 'rounded', 'Bond-Girl', 'ever', 'grace', 'screen', 'major', 'credit', 'giving', 'film', 'sense', 'warmth', 'reality', 'other', 'performances', 'are', 'also', 'well', 'placed', 'especially', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'who', 'role', 'M.What', 'admire', 'film', 'ability', 'prove', 'superior', 'rest', 'genre', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'action/thriller', 'type', 'films', 'rarely', 'do', 'ever', 'reach', 'magnitude', 'level', 'perfection', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'flawless', 'acting', 'award', 'worthy', 'script', 'tight', 'coherent', 'set', 'pieces', 'are', 'brilliant', 'designed', 'direction', 'astonishing', 'fact', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pick', 'out', 'single', 'flaw', 'Even', 'wife', 'who', 'literally', 'had', 'drag', 'theater', 'loved', 'movie', 'fact', 'made', 'take', 'back', 'see', 'second', 'time', 'insisted', 'purchase', 'minute', 'was', 'released', 'DVD.As', 'far', 'DVD', 'concerned', 'extras', 'are', 'price', 'disc', 'scenes', 'featurette', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'discussing', 'training', 'film', 'such', 'great', 'extra', 'one', 'entertaining', 'worth', 'watching', 'funny', 'rare', 'extras', 'DVD', 'ever', 'really', 'interest', 'must', 'say', 'watched', 'enjoyed', 'immensely.So', 'bottom', 'line', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'quite', 'frankly', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'Bond', 'movie', 'yet', 'certainly', 'most', 'polished', 'entertaining', 'days', 'when', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'carried', 'title', 'Many', 'were', 'skeptical', 'Craig', 'ability', 'pull', ""'m"", 'here', 'say', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'better', 'Bond', 'so', 'far', 'ability', 'not', 'only', 'carry', 'out', 'amazing', 'stunts', 'involved', 'also', 'make', 'character', 'real', 'first', 'time', 'making', 'Bond', 'someone', 'understand', 'admire']",N/A

It seems strange that a Bond fan like myself felt a little disappointed coming out of this film.  Myself and the two people I saw this with felt like something was missing from the film, but everyone else I know who has seen the film has loved it, claiming that it is the herald of a revitalized Bond franchise.  Looking back on the film, it is better than I first remembered, but I still feel like something was lacking.Casino Royale serves as a reboot of the James Bond franchise; it isn't a prequel to the other films in the series despite the fact that it is the story of James Bond's first mission as a 00-agent.  It starts the series over, taking Bond back to his roots as a spy without super-gadgets and self-parody.  Bond (Daniel Craig) has recently been promoted to 00-status, becoming 007.  His first mission involves Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen), a terrorist financier.  After a botched capture in Madagascar, Bond is led to Le Chiffre by one of his constituents.  As it turns out, Le Chiffre lost a lot of his clients' money (due to Bond), and he intends to win it back in a high stakes poker game.  M (Judi Dench), who pretty much despises Bond due to his brash nature and relative lack of experience, orders Bond to join the game and make sure Le Chiffre doesn't win.The film follows Bond as he learns how to perform as a 00.  M's assesment of Bond is not wrong, and he has a lot to learn before he becomes the suave agent that we are most familiar with.The problems I had with the film had to do with the film's pacing.  It seemed like there would be action scenes that would go on way too long.  As a Bond film, action sequences are fun and expected, but in this film, some seemed to just be over the top and unending.  Towards the end, the scenes with Bond and Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) grew very tiresome and I honestly thought that they were part of a dream sequence.Still, despite the problems that I had with the movie, it still had many enjoyable aspects, and I would reccomend seeing it.

1048061,ARA48345JZPZR,B000MNP2K8,Archmaker,"[6, 10]","I don't know how general audiences will take to a re-imagined, back-to-the-source, colder and harder James Bond as brought to the screen by a thoroughly believable Daniel Craig, but for my money, the team behind Casino Royale has shot some juice back into what had become a lackluster, farcical, and moribund series, reinvigorating the characters while dispensing with much of the nonsense and clutter that had accumulated over the years.I haven't gone to a theatre to see a James Bond movie in decades, the last memorable outing probably On Her Majesty's Secret Service (one of the better efforts: good movie, bad Bond (Lazenby).  I had seen the various Bonds over the years on cable or DVD and the movies were always somewhat amusing,  well-produced with some great stunts, but they had become so comic-booky and increasingly self-parodying that I found them hopelessly silly and overblown.  I found the Roger Moore era especially egregious and dismal while the attempt in the Timothy Dalton phase to sort-of get back to a grittier Bond was a nice try, but no cigar.  Pierce Brosnan's films were good, but by now so cluttered with nonsense that his last, with the invisible car and the villain's Ice Palace (nee Fortress of Solitude) only served to demonstrate that Bond had become Spiderman.I had read with relish Ian Fleming's series as a kid and loved the first 3 or 4 Bond movies, with From Russia with Love and Goldfinger favorites, and closest to the novels.  Thunderball was okay, but I started to lose it with You Only Live Twice and the volcano fortress and rocket gobbling, Donald Pleasence doing Blofeld as Dr. Evil, and all the rest of the tripe they began piling onto the series.So we come back to the first book in the series, Casino Royale, and the producers have shrewdly gambled on taking Bond Back to Basics.  I think they have succeeded admirably, and hope they will find an audience for the newer, harsher Bond.  Judging by some of the reviews from Bond loyalists I read here, many of them also welcome a new breath of life in what was becoming a stale and outdated franchise.You have terrific stunts with some really exceptional physical stunt work.  Fights that are nasty and brutal with pain that appears to be painful, and a double-O assassin who looks and acts like an assassin. Judy Dench is a marvelous M.  We have dispensed with Q and all the fantastical and silly gadgets for less but more appropriate equipment.  There aren't a bevy of Bond girls, but when you have the gorgeous Eva Green, you really don't need anyone else.  By and large the cliched quips are gone in favor of some dialogue that is actually kind of adult and often pretty snappy (thank you Paul Haggis).  You have villains that actually inhabit this planet and not Marvel Comics land.  There is a story with some twists and a beginning for Bond that lays the groundwork for some intriguing possibilities as to where they want to take him.  And you have Daniel Craig doing his damndest to re-define the role and make it his own.Take away the Bond name and legacy, and you would still have a hell of a  good movie here.  It looks great.  It is richly produced with care, and is smartly directed.  It goes places Bond movies in later years seem to have feared to tread.  I enjoyed it immensely, and yes, I would pay to go see the next one in the theatre.  By bringing Bond back closer to Fleming's creation, and by bringing in an actor without the expected, traditional look but who is a bloody good actor, and by dispensing with great heaps of the rubbish, they've hooked me back into it.

He brings a toughness and believability to the role which has been missing for a long time. Real secret service operatives who do what Bond does are often ex-military special forces types, not dandies who worry about whether their martinis are shaken or stirred. This hard edge comes through in many of Ian Fleming's books: Casino Royale captures that tone, as did the early  Bond films with Connery. Many of the other films with Moore, Dalton, and Brosnan seem almost cartoonish by comparison.",5,Really Good,1176163200,"04 10, 2007",2007,624,"['have', 'been', 'Bond', 'fan', 'beginning', 'must', 'agree', 'several', 'other', 'reviewers', 'Craig', 'best', 'Bond', 'Connery', 'toughness', 'believability', 'role', 'been', 'missing', 'long', 'time', 'Real', 'secret', 'service', 'operatives', 'who', 'do', 'what', 'Bond', 'are', 'often', 'ex-military', 'special', 'forces', 'types', 'not', 'dandies', 'who', 'worry', 'martinis', 'are', 'shaken', 'stirred', 'hard', 'edge', 'many', 'Ian', 'Fleming', 'books', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'tone', 'did', 'early', 'Bond', 'films', 'Connery', 'Many', 'other', 'films', 'Moore', 'Dalton', 'Brosnan', 'seem', 'almost', 'cartoonish', 'comparison']",N/A
1048063,A1UTIT634AL3KQ,B000MNP2K8,arganon,"[3, 4]","OK. Let me first state that my favorite Bond was Sean Connery. To that point let me advise you to take Casino Royale as its own entity. This is not a Bond movie in the tradition of the tongue-in-cheek quips, sexual romping or suave machismo of the Bonds of the past. It's a rough and gritty film where this Bond character makes more than one mistake, gets in over his head and is a mystifyingly ""burnt-out"" after just making the prestigious ""00"" status.Alright, here's where things get confusing if you take this as another James Bond film. It's out of order in the sequence of time with the other films. This is Bond's first adventure the viewer, or reader if you read the books, has with the character. Cool, but this takes place in present day and not in the past. This is why I advise you to discount all other Bond movies. Don't waste your time with the little insights that, I believe, are suppose to ""flesh-out"" the character of the other films. It will only add to you unsuccessfully trying to logically fit all the other Bond movies in context. This will get in the way of enjoying what the movie does have to offer the viewer.I've got to say here that, Caterina Murino, was a knock-out in the truest of Bond girl traditions. We needed more of that in this story. From the, now infamous opening Bond movie credits, we can see there isn't going to be much fun in the sack with this show. By the way, the opening credit graphics are fantastic and don't disappoint from a visual aspect. As stated, the movie takes place contemporarily which accounts for the brutality depicted in the portrayal of the action? The old Bond almost never got his hands dirty. Daniel Craig wallows in one bloody confrontation after another and still manages to tidy up with hardly a cut on him. No bruising or scrapes even though he's just come back from either getting the poop kicked out of him or visa versa. If we all could heel so miraculously!!!What is there that makes this film worth watching? The action scenes. They are very good, especially the ""Jackie Chan""-style feats at the beginning of the movie. The amazing places where we travel with Bond. A story that shows it's not as easy as the old James Bond's character portrayed being in a job that really sucks. There's not much glamour getting the [...] kicked out of you all the time. And . . . I guess Daniel Craig's performance. I begrudging give credit here because there are times when I can feel some empathy for him and then there are times when there doesn't seem to be much substance to his character. But, he definitely seems like a guy who's rather new at the ""00"" job. From my perspective Daniel is not a suave, debonair or even a slightly mistakable smooth operator. Rather he is more the civil savage. Brooding, rugged and definitely VERY rough around the edges. I suppose this is the ""insight"" as to how James Bond became the character to come? Like I said, don't try and figure it out in context. The sudden switch in his character from cool killer to love lost schoolboy at the end is also a bit disjointed. You just want to smack him up side the head so he comes back to reality. But, hey, maybe that's why he's a little confused by the end of the movie; too many cracks up side the head?!?!?!?What's not to like about this picture? The repeated unrealistic physical comebacks of Craig's character. Also, there's not much ""fun"" in this film so you're hit with endless struggles. ""In the old days"" James Bond had a little pleasure with his business and you dreamed of being ""James Bond"". If you dream of being this character you must be a masochist. Eva Green's portrayal of the character Vesper left me rather flat. Mads Mikkelsen's acting of the villain, Le Chiffre, was great but at times you couldn't hear what the heck he was saying. Poor sound?!?!? And lastly, the storyline got a bit foggy at times. It probably could have been streamlined more and it would have made the plot so much more entertaining instead of an on-the-fly self-editing task.If I took the film as a stand-alone I would say it was a good adult, no sex, adventure. Full of amazing photography and settings. And, with enough of a plot, use your own editing filter when watching, to be an enjoyable viewing.",3,A secret agent's job sucks!!!,1179273600,"05 16, 2007",2007,4245,"['OK.', 'Let', 'first', 'state', 'favorite', 'Bond', 'was', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'point', 'let', 'advise', 'take', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'own', 'entity', 'not', 'Bond', 'movie', 'tradition', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'quips', 'sexual', 'romping', 'suave', 'machismo', 'Bonds', 'past', 'rough', 'gritty', 'film', 'where', 'Bond', 'character', 'more', 'one', 'mistake', 'head', 'mystifyingly', 'burnt-out', 'just', 'making', 'prestigious', '00', 'status.Alright', 'here', 'where', 'things', 'get', 'confusing', 'take', 'James', 'Bond', 'film', 'order', 'sequence', 'time', 'other', 'films', 'Bond', 'first', 'adventure', 'viewer', 'reader', 'read', 'books', 'character', 'Cool', 'place', 'present', 'day', 'not', 'past', 'why', 'advise', 'discount', 'other', 'Bond', 'movies', 'Do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'little', 'insights', 'believe', 'are', 'suppose', 'flesh-out', 'character', 'other', 'films', 'will', 'only', 'add', 'unsuccessfully', 'trying', 'logically', 'fit', 'other', 'Bond', 'movies', 'context', 'will', 'get', 'way', 'enjoying', 'what', 'movie', 'have', 'offer', 'viewer.I', ""'ve"", 'got', 'say', 'here', 'that', 'Caterina', 'Murino', 'was', 'knock-out', 'truest', 'Bond', 'girl', 'traditions', 'needed', 'more', 'story', 'now', 'infamous', 'opening', 'Bond', 'movie', 'credits', 'can', 'see', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'much', 'fun', 'sack', 'show', 'way', 'opening', 'credit', 'graphics', 'are', 'fantastic', 'do', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'visual', 'aspect', 'stated', 'movie', 'place', 'contemporarily', 'brutality', 'depicted', 'portrayal', 'action', 'old', 'Bond', 'almost', 'never', 'got', 'hands', 'dirty', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'one', 'bloody', 'confrontation', 'still', 'tidy', 'up', 'hardly', 'cut', 'bruising', 'scrapes', 'even', 'just', 'come', 'back', 'getting', 'poop', 'kicked', 'visa', 'versa', 'could', 'heel', 'so', 'miraculously', 'What', 'film', 'watching', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'especially', 'Jackie', 'Chan', '-style', 'feats', 'beginning', 'movie', 'amazing', 'places', 'where', 'travel', 'Bond', 'A', 'story', 'not', 'as', 'easy', 'old', 'James', 'Bond', 'character', 'portrayed', 'being', 'job', 'really', 'not', 'much', 'glamour', 'getting', '[', ']', 'kicked', 'time', 'guess', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'performance', 'begrudging', 'give', 'credit', 'here', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'can', 'feel', 'empathy', 'then', 'are', 'times', 'when', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'much', 'substance', 'character', 'definitely', 'guy', 'who', 'rather', 'new', '00', 'job', 'perspective', 'Daniel', 'not', 'suave', 'debonair', 'even', 'slightly', 'mistakable', 'smooth', 'operator', 'more', 'civil', 'savage', 'Brooding', 'rugged', 'definitely', 'VERY', 'rough', 'edges', 'suppose', 'insight', 'how', 'James', 'Bond', 'became', 'character', 'come', 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'context', 'sudden', 'switch', 'character', 'cool', 'killer', 'love', 'lost', 'schoolboy', 'end', 'also', 'bit', 'disjointed', 'just', 'want', 'smack', 'up', 'side', 'head', 'back', 'reality', 'hey', 'maybe', 'why', 'little', 'confused', 'end', 'movie', 'too', 'many', 'cracks', 'up', 'side', 'head', 'What', 'not', 'like', 'picture', 'repeated', 'unrealistic', 'physical', 'comebacks', 'Craig', 'character', 'Also', 'not', 'much', 'fun', 'film', 'so', ""'re"", 'hit', 'endless', 'struggles', 'old', 'days', 'James', 'Bond', 'had', 'little', 'pleasure', 'business', 'dreamed', 'being', 'James', 'Bond', 'dream', 'being', 'character', 'must', 'be', 'masochist', 'Eva', 'Green', 'portrayal', 'character', 'Vesper', 'left', 'rather', 'flat', 'Mads', 'Mikkelsen', 'acting', 'villain', 'Le', 'Chiffre', 'was', 'great', 'times', 'could', ""n't"", 'hear', 'what', 'heck', 'was', 'saying', 'Poor', 'sound', 'lastly', 'storyline', 'got', 'bit', 'foggy', 'times', 'probably', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'streamlined', 'more', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'plot', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'entertaining', 'instead', 'on-the-fly', 'self-editing', 'task.If', 'took', 'film', 'stand-alone', 'would', 'say', 'was', 'good', 'adult', 'sex', 'adventure', 'Full', 'amazing', 'photography', 'settings', 'enough', 'plot', 'use', 'own', 'editing', 'filter', 'when', 'watching', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'viewing']",N/A

1048066,AY5ALNAA118ZL,B000MNP2K8,"A. Shane ""dresh""","[5, 8]","Every ten years or so, the producers behind the James Bond movies get an itch to re-invent the entire genre; and `yes' the Bond films are far beyond a mere film franchise - they are, in fact, a genre onto themselves. This genre, which by now includes The Bourne films, Mission Impossible, and stuff like Alias and Austin Powers, is complete with a clear set of tropes and clich&eacute;s that can be referenced, tweaked, and altered to create a new-yet-familiar effect that every genre thrives upon.Up to this point the Bond pictures have generally kept their re-inventions fairly conservative; adjusting the tone to fit the strengths of their changing leading men, while keeping the Bond character basically still. Unlike most other film series, the Bond films each exist individually, not really following or even referencing the previous installments (with just a few exceptions). Bond, an established and self-contained character, simply enters each film, kills the bad guys, bangs the ladies, and saves the day. By their very nature, every Bond film is the first and the last Bond film.That's probably why Casino Royale, (Bond 21) feels so different. After more than 40 years since Sean Connery uttered the immortal words ""Bond, James Bond"" - and changed our perception of screen masculinity - 007 gets an origin story. Does it work?  Well frankly, Casino Royale left me a bit puzzled. I loved some aspects of the plot and the conceit itself is intriguing, but the film is unevenly paced, and its structure and tone is all over the place.Daniel Craig has been given the most leeway since Connery, to create an original character; he doesn't just step into the role of Bond, he gets to build it from scratch. His Bond doesn't start as the Bond we know, but he's supposed to be the Bond we know, by the end. And this is the film's biggest problem; we go to see a 007 film, but instead we get a film about a guy who's trying to become 007. By the end, I was basically ready to see the next film, the one in which Bond is Bond, but I really wasn't itching to have more of Casino Royale. Craig is a good actor, but he's not the most charismatic Bond (I'd put him behind Bronsnan) and his physical appearance is so un-Bond-like, he constantly has to overcome his own lack of suave. Blonde, short, and noticeably Cockney, Craig is the most miscast Bond ever. But what he lacks in looks, he makes up for in sheer physicality; this guy can probably beat up Moore, Dalton, and Brosnan all at the same time. And the action scenes, most being fairly organic fights and chases, really cook. This is where Casino Royale is at its best. There's a foot chase early in the film that's one of the best action sequences ever in a Bond film; and that's saying something. There's also a scene that's very reminiscent of Raiders Of the Lost Ark (to the point of rip-off really) that still manages to be quite satisfying. Through all this, Craig bleeds and sweats more than all the previous Bonds combined; this guy is physical to the max. And it's during these action scenes that his Bond is most effective.But by the middle of act two, the film settles into the casino showdown with villain Le Chiffre (Madds Mikkelsen), and things get a bit stiff. There's a crucial romance with fellow agent, Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) that should have felt stronger; the chemistry between these two is fairly mild. The poker showdown is nothing groundbreaking, though I do understand why they substituted Texas Hold-Em for the Baccarat of the novel; poker is more confrontational. But the competition is presented in separate `rounds' (in an apparent homage to Cincinatti Kid) and it creates a jarring stop-and-go affect that doesn't serve the film's pacing. Then things get downright gruesome as Bond gets tortured (not threatened, but really tortured), then recuperates (seriously... there's several hospital scenes) and then ... Casino Royale just kind of fizzles out. Sure, there's a sort of afterthought action finale, but it's both unspectacular and bizarrely referential to Moonraker, one of the worst Bond films ever. Then there's a coda that finally gives us the Bond we know and love for literally a second and... roll end credits. This left me with the burning question: couldn't they have given us what we came for just a bit earlier? I mean, the film is well over two hours long! Can't we have both a radical re-invention and a satisfying comfort food that one expects from a Bond film? Or at least how about a movie that has a consistent tone from beginning to end. I know it's a tough mission, but certainly not an impossible one. Maybe next time.",3,CASINO ROYALE - A Bit Too Dry For Me,1233360000,"01 31, 2009",2009,4628,"['ten', 'years', 'so', 'producers', 'James', 'Bond', 'movies', 'get', 'itch', 're-invent', 'entire', 'genre', 'yes', 'Bond', 'films', 'are', 'far', 'mere', 'film', 'franchise', 'are', 'fact', 'genre', 'genre', 'now', 'Bourne', 'films', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'stuff', 'Alias', 'Austin', 'Powers', 'complete', 'clear', 'set', 'tropes', 'clich', 'eacute', 'can', 'be', 'referenced', 'tweaked', 'altered', 'create', 'new-yet-familiar', 'effect', 'genre', 'upon.Up', 'point', 'Bond', 'pictures', 'have', 'generally', 'kept', 're-inventions', 'fairly', 'conservative', 'adjusting', 'tone', 'fit', 'strengths', 'changing', 'leading', 'men', 'keeping', 'Bond', 'character', 'basically', 'still', 'most', 'other', 'film', 'series', 'Bond', 'films', 'exist', 'individually', 'not', 'really', 'following', 'even', 'referencing', 'previous', 'installments', 'just', 'few', 'exceptions', 'Bond', 'established', 'self-contained', 'character', 'simply', 'film', 'bad', 'guys', 'ladies', 'day', 'very', 'nature', 'Bond', 'film', 'first', 'last', 'Bond', 'film.That', 'probably', 'why', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'Bond', '21', 'feels', 'so', 'different', 'more', '40', 'years', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'uttered', 'immortal', 'words', 'Bond', 'James', 'Bond', 'changed', 'perception', 'screen', 'masculinity', '007', 'origin', 'story', 'work', 'Well', 'frankly', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'left', 'bit', 'puzzled', 'loved', 'aspects', 'plot', 'conceit', 'intriguing', 'film', 'unevenly', 'paced', 'structure', 'tone', 'place.Daniel', 'Craig', 'been', 'given', 'most', 'leeway', 'Connery', 'create', 'original', 'character', ""n't"", 'just', 'step', 'role', 'Bond', 'build', 'scratch', 'Bond', ""n't"", 'start', 'Bond', 'know', 'supposed', 'be', 'Bond', 'know', 'end', 'film', 'biggest', 'problem', 'go', 'see', '007', 'film', 'instead', 'get', 'film', 'guy', 'who', 'trying', 'become', '007', 'end', 'was', 'basically', 'ready', 'see', 'next', 'film', 'one', 'Bond', 'Bond', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'itching', 'have', 'more', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'Craig', 'good', 'actor', 'not', 'most', 'charismatic', 'Bond', ""'d"", 'put', 'Bronsnan', 'physical', 'appearance', 'so', 'un-Bond-like', 'constantly', 'overcome', 'own', 'lack', 'suave', 'Blonde', 'short', 'noticeably', 'Cockney', 'Craig', 'most', 'miscast', 'Bond', 'ever', 'what', 'looks', 'up', 'sheer', 'physicality', 'guy', 'can', 'probably', 'beat', 'up', 'Moore', 'Dalton', 'Brosnan', 'same', 'time', 'action', 'scenes', 'most', 'being', 'fairly', 'organic', 'fights', 'chases', 'really', 'cook', 'where', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'best', 'foot', 'chase', 'early', 'film', 'one', 'best', 'action', 'sequences', 'ever', 'Bond', 'film', 'saying', 'something', 'also', 'scene', 'very', 'reminiscent', 'Raiders', 'Lost', 'Ark', 'point', 'rip-off', 'really', 'still', 'be', 'quite', 'satisfying', 'Craig', 'bleeds', 'sweats', 'more', 'previous', 'Bonds', 'combined', 'guy', 'physical', 'max', 'action', 'scenes', 'Bond', 'most', 'effective.But', 'middle', 'act', 'two', 'film', 'casino', 'showdown', 'villain', 'Le', 'Chiffre', 'Madds', 'Mikkelsen', 'things', 'get', 'bit', 'stiff', 'crucial', 'romance', 'fellow', 'agent', 'Vesper', 'Lynd', 'Eva', 'Green', 'should', 'have', 'felt', 'stronger', 'chemistry', 'two', 'fairly', 'mild', 'poker', 'showdown', 'nothing', 'groundbreaking', 'do', 'understand', 'why', 'substituted', 'Texas', 'Hold-Em', 'Baccarat', 'novel', 'poker', 'more', 'confrontational', 'competition', 'presented', 'separate', 'rounds', 'apparent', 'homage', 'Cincinatti', 'Kid', 'jarring', 'stop-and-go', 'affect', ""n't"", 'serve', 'film', 'pacing', 'Then', 'things', 'get', 'downright', 'gruesome', 'Bond', 'tortured', 'not', 'threatened', 'really', 'tortured', 'then', 'seriously', 'several', 'hospital', 'scenes', 'then', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'just', 'kind', 'fizzles', 'out', 'Sure', 'sort', 'afterthought', 'action', 'finale', 'unspectacular', 'bizarrely', 'referential', 'Moonraker', 'one', 'worst', 'Bond', 'films', 'ever', 'Then', 'coda', 'finally', 'Bond', 'know', 'love', 'literally', 'second', 'roll', 'end', 'credits', 'left', 'burning', 'question', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'given', 'what', 'came', 'just', 'bit', 'earlier', 'mean', 'film', 'well', 'two', 'hours', 'long', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'radical', 're-invention', 'satisfying', 'comfort', 'food', 'one', 'Bond', 'film', 'least', 'how', 'movie', 'consistent', 'tone', 'beginning', 'end', 'know', 'tough', 'mission', 'certainly', 'not', 'impossible', 'one', 'Maybe', 'next', 'time']",N/A

Okay, first up: Daniel Craig is an excellent James Bond. I love that he can give his all in grueling action scenes and still look dapper in a fitted tuxedo. I was overjoyed with Craig's performance. Next up is the plot which is supposed to be Bond's first case so don't be too alarmed to see Bond make some abysmal errors here and there. It's his first day on the job so we gotta cut him some slack. Who woulda thought that a casino game could be so intriguing? I sure didn't but it's in here. The action sequences are beautiful from Bond's non-stop chase after a suspect to another harrowing chase on an airport runway. I also liked the stripped down tone of the film. There were less inuendos and more realistic character performances. No schtick, just a pure action film.

Gone are the cool gadgets, the super villains, the charisma and charm, the clever one liners that convey character,the awesome music themes, the great seducer of all those Bond girls, the brilliant secret agent that hadextensive knowledge on nearly everything, and who was always cool and unflappable in the face of danger.  That James Bond is dead. The James Bond films that were great fun escapism, are now replaced with a somber, depressing, brooding and dark version.No Miss Moneypenny, no Q, the only person they kept is the one they should have gotten rid of, Judi Dench as that obnoxious feminist, M, who somehow must have traveled through time to go back to what is supposed to be Bond's first mission.Martini shaken, not stirred?  When a barman asks the new Bond whether he'll take his martini shaken or stirred, Craig snaps ""Do I look like I give a da*n?""

He's here to stay.Casino Royale has a strong plot for once and makes it even stronger by showing us where Bond came from and how he smoothed away some of the rough edges. And the edges are brutally rough here. The killings are nasty and the aftermath has to be dealt with in a way Bonds have never done before.  The real ace in the hand is Craig. He doesn't have Connery's raw star quality, but he's easily the best actor to have played the part. I don't know if the film was shot in sequence but for the only time since OHMSS you get a sense of Bond changing throughout the film as his cockiness becomes confidence and his brutality becomes cold efficiency. He starts off unlikeable but human and gradually picks up the Bond traits we know until he becomes more likable but just a little less human. It's an interesting journey and Craig is up to it. It's not just his delivery, it's also his body language. Even his fighting style changes as he adapts.  Physically he's the most in your face Bond and the action scenes look brutal for once.  Even the not very likely free running chase is spectacular but believable because you get the idea that this really is kill or be killed stuff. It's got a real feel of danger to it that hasn't been seen in the series in years. Only the torture scene feels like it's holding back (it's almost as tastefully done as the old TV version) but that's probably fear of the censors.You'll come out of this one not just thinking that Daniel Craig IS James Bond, but that no-one has ever played him before.

1048075,AE7EQ5123M75T,B000MNP2K8,a writer/reader/listener,"[6, 10]","I've been reading Ian Fleming's James Bond stories since my teen years (we won't discuss the offerings of subsequent authors), and I've repeatedly seen all of the movies, most of which mangle the Fleming books to a greater or less degree. That's unfortunate, for the real genius of Bond lies in Fleming's stories, and now the filmmakers at last seems to have realized that. In my experience, NOTHING the studios have ever done until now comes close to capturing the spirit of Fleming's Bond. Casino Royale does. (Ironic, since the novel on which it's based isn't one of Fleming's strongest.)This movie strips away decades of celluloid layers of convoluted plots, stylized humor, overblown and even stupidly-conceived villains, and fetishistic devotion to gadgetry, and at last returns to the basics: A fast-paced plot that follows Fleming's original novel pretty closely, and Daniel Craig's portrayal of a Bond exactly as Fleming wrote him. This is a Bond who is, at one level, passionate for life and somewhat reckless, while simultaneously (and paradoxically) cold, calculating, and professional. Fleming's narrative style allowed us to listen in on Bond's thoughts, giving us a three-dimensional character (despite Blofeld's description of him in the book You Only Live Twice), and for the first time ever in the films, Craig manages to portray that complexity. He's totally unforced. Dalton and Bosnan give us glimmers, selected dimensions, of the true Bond (Dalton's darkness, Brosnan's ""I never grew up""), but Craig nails it. He IS James Bond. There is, somewhat regrettably, still more than a touch of the ""rogue agent"" element here that's a creature of the films rather than the books, but this time, unlike the other films, it doesn't come across as quirky but instead underscores how ruthless and dangerous Bond really is. A ""decent"" person doesn't break into a lady's home, especially when the lady in question is his boss. A ""decent"" man doesn't make a practice of bedding a string of married women, but Fleming's Bond does, and so, pointedly, does Craig. He has just the right amount of understated humor (as opposed to silliness a la Roger Moore et al.) as well, also typical of Fleming's Bond. In short, he takes the role seriously and plays it just as Fleming wrote it, and the producer, director, and writer all let him, much to their credit.As to the rest, it largely measures up to Craig. Judi Dench is the best M ever, just as dangerous and ruthless in her own way as Bond is, highly faithful to Fleming's M despite the sex change. Mads Mikkelsen is an excellent Le Chiffre, very human as opposed to the years of set-piece supervillians we got from the films from the '60's until the early '80s. (When he begins to lose his temper while torturing Bond, it's perhaps the most humanizing moment for any cinema Bond villain. It's nice to have a villain show some emotion for a change instead of sitting around in a zany Stalinesque uniform oozing affectation and plotting world destruction, although that stereotype does admittedly trace its roots to the Fleming books.) Eva Green is closely faithful to Fleming's Vesper and even looks like her.  The film downplays Felix Leiter and does get Rene Mathis wrong--in the books Mathis is Bond's old and unquestionably loyal friend--but compared to the stellar job the producer does with the rest of the film, these are minor qualms. The score is lush and understated, and the theme song may possibly be the best one ever: edgy, high-energy, with lyrics that evoke a combination of danger, recklessness, and cynicism, PERFECTLY reflecting Bond's character. It works seamlessly with what is also the best opening sequence ever in the Bond film series.By now you get the idea. This film deserves nothing but superlatives and has set a very high bar for the next outing. To paraphrase a review of one of Fleming's books, the movie is escapism, of course, but what escapism!

Many people have had to eat their words. This Bond is tougher, leaner, and can be deadlier when need be. Some people complain(among many other hilarious things if you look at other reviews) that the charm and swagger isn't there. Not in abundance with Bonds past, no nor does it absolutely need to be, but it is there. The film, and Craig, breathe new life into the franchise, which was already doing just fine with Brosnan(who I still like better). It's a little grittier, and there is some old school Bond involved here. The story?. Pretty good. Starting from the beginning when Bond became a double O agent, he goes against evil villain Le Chiffre(Mads Mikkelsen), in a high stakes poker game, to thwart him from funding more terrorist acts. Fun premise. A big part of the Bond films is the villain. Mads Mikkelsen is unique and interesting looking. He has the presence, and has the right, classic evil Bond guy look. He weeps blood from his disfigured eye. The villain is handled a bit differently in the end than in most other Bond films. One of the better Bond villains in a good long while. The female is Vesper Lynd(Eva Green), and the ensuing romance, while good for showing Bond in a more human, relatable light, does bog the film down towards the end. It feels like it could of been done away with. The character is appealing, but it adds up to just being another Bond girl, really. Eva, however, is exceptionally lovely. Judi Dench is back as M, and the film just works. The first half is exceptionally good, with Bond being set up as an agent, and his relationship with M. The first big action/chase scene is quite something, as is the airport scene. Things slow down a bit in the second half from the first half, but the locations, Craig's Bond, and overall tone of the film save it. The end action climax is thrilling. The film also boasts a great tune. Chris Cornell's ""You Know My Name"" is rocking and modern, with a touch of old school Bond theme signatures. Makes you forget all about Madonna's uninspired Bond theme. It all comes back to Craig, though. He doesn't seem like Bond at first, but he definitley does as the film rolls along. He has a strong, undeniable presence, and you believe him in everything that he does in the film. The filmmakers are also aware of Craig's more buff physique, as it is on display a number of times throughtout the movie. In the end, Casino Royale is a wonderfully put together and directed Bond film. It has classic-retro Bond touches here and there, and really sets up a sparkling new life on the 44 year old series. As for extras, it's a bit slight, compared to DAD and other Bond films. The Bond Girl featurette is the best of the bunch. The film does feel to be a tad bit too long and goes on another 20 minutes or so when it feels like it should of already been over. Craig is not Connery, but he doesn't need to be. He is the Bond of today. Nobody still does it better than Bond.",5,"Introducing Craig, Daniel Craig",1174694400,"03 24, 2007",2007,3061,"['Going', 'harshest', 'critics', 'fans', 'Daniel', 'Craig', '6th', 'James', 'Bond', 'passes', 'flying', 'colors', 'Many', 'people', 'have', 'had', 'eat', 'words', 'Bond', 'tougher', 'leaner', 'can', 'be', 'deadlier', 'when', 'need', 'be', 'people', 'complain', 'many', 'other', 'hilarious', 'things', 'look', 'other', 'reviews', 'charm', 'swagger', ""n't"", 'there', 'Not', 'abundance', 'Bonds', 'past', 'absolutely', 'need', 'be', 'there', 'film', 'Craig', 'breathe', 'new', 'life', 'franchise', 'was', 'already', 'doing', 'just', 'fine', 'Brosnan', 'who', 'still', 'better', 'little', 'grittier', 'old', 'school', 'Bond', 'involved', 'here', 'story', 'Pretty', 'good', 'Starting', 'beginning', 'when', 'Bond', 'became', 'double', 'O', 'agent', 'evil', 'villain', 'Le', 'Chiffre', 'Mads', 'Mikkelsen', 'high', 'stakes', 'poker', 'game', 'thwart', 'funding', 'more', 'terrorist', 'acts', 'Fun', 'premise', 'big', 'part', 'Bond', 'films', 'villain', 'Mads', 'Mikkelsen', 'unique', 'interesting', 'looking', 'presence', 'right', 'classic', 'evil', 'Bond', 'guy', 'look', 'weeps', 'blood', 'disfigured', 'eye', 'villain', 'handled', 'bit', 'differently', 'end', 'most', 'other', 'Bond', 'films', 'One', 'better', 'Bond', 'villains', 'good', 'long', 'female', 'Vesper', 'Lynd', 'Eva', 'Green', 'ensuing', 'romance', 'good', 'showing', 'Bond', 'more', 'human', 'relatable', 'light', 'bog', 'film', 'down', 'towards', 'end', 'could', 'been', 'done', 'away', 'character', 'appealing', 'up', 'just', 'being', 'Bond', 'girl', 'really', 'Eva', 'however', 'exceptionally', 'lovely', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'back', 'M', 'film', 'just', 'first', 'half', 'exceptionally', 'good', 'Bond', 'being', 'set', 'up', 'agent', 'relationship', 'M.', 'first', 'big', 'action/chase', 'scene', 'quite', 'something', 'airport', 'scene', 'Things', 'slow', 'down', 'bit', 'second', 'half', 'first', 'half', 'locations', 'Craig', 'Bond', 'overall', 'tone', 'film', 'save', 'end', 'action', 'climax', 'thrilling', 'film', 'also', 'great', 'tune', 'Chris', 'Cornell', 'Know', 'Name', 'rocking', 'modern', 'touch', 'old', 'school', 'Bond', 'theme', 'signatures', 'Makes', 'forget', 'Madonna', 'uninspired', 'Bond', 'theme', 'back', 'Craig', 'though', ""n't"", 'seem', 'Bond', 'first', 'definitley', 'film', 'rolls', 'along', 'strong', 'undeniable', 'presence', 'believe', 'everything', 'film', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'also', 'aware', 'Craig', 'more', 'buff', 'physique', 'display', 'number', 'times', 'movie', 'end', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'wonderfully', 'put', 'together', 'directed', 'Bond', 'film', 'classic-retro', 'Bond', 'touches', 'here', 'there', 'really', 'up', 'sparkling', 'new', 'life', '44', 'year', 'old', 'series', 'extras', 'bit', 'slight', 'compared', 'DAD', 'other', 'Bond', 'films', 'Bond', 'Girl', 'featurette', 'best', 'bunch', 'film', 'feel', 'be', 'tad', 'bit', 'too', 'long', '20', 'minutes', 'so', 'when', 'should', 'already', 'been', 'Craig', 'not', 'Connery', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'Bond', 'today', 'Nobody', 'still', 'better', 'Bond']",N/A

Perice Brosan didn't want to play James Bond anymore anyway ok. I'm sorry he says it on the Die Another Day DVD. So for all you so called true fans out there saying bring him back he didn't want the job. Only other guy that honestly may have done half as good a job and fits is Clive Owens, not Peirce Brosan ok.3. Daniel Craig acually played Bond the way it would work in real life. Think about every single movie, every single magazine article, newspaper story, book, and tv show you have every seen about real life assissains. Now stop and think about it...""Did any of those guys sound like happy go lucky people who just pranced around being swave and smooth and just be your best darn buddy all the time? No."" Daniel Craig played the charcter like a real person not like ""oh jeez I'm James Bond so I have to be super cool."" That is not how people act in real life espically not if their life was on the line. Think about it...if you were being posined, shot at, stabbed, beat up, tortured, being paid worse than a teacher, and not always being told by your employers(the goverenment) good job or even the full story of why you have to go on these missions...hey you would be pretty crazy and angry and whenever you got the chance you would take it out on someone. Thats how Dainel Craig captures...if James Bond were real...would he be happy...how would he treat his boss...how would he treat his coworkers...how would he feel about himself.

Casino Royale is my favorite of the Flemming novels [edging out Thunderball], so I have been waiting anxiously for a proper film treatment of the introductory story in the Bond canon, which made me all the more nervous about seeing the blonde Bond take the licence from Pierce Brosnan.  Well, mission accomplished.  Craig turns out to be the perfect blend of rough around the edges in the movie's opening third and then grows perfectly into the sort of Bond that we're used to seeing as the character is promoted and eases into his new slate as a 'double-o'.  The story is similar to the original novel, with Bond having to outwit LeChifre at a casino, though character names and some details of the actual characters are updated and shuffled to account for modern political situations.  The action sequences that begin and end the movie are spectacular, whereas the middle portion is where the character does the most developing as an espionage agent  This is a very long film by Bond standards, but it only drags a little near the end before picking back up again.  My trepidations were unfounded as Craig and company pull off the story and add to the fledgling franchise quite nicely.  The omages and nods to the series' long past are especially well done [variations on the vodka martini, Bond's preference to married women and his favored choice of vehicle].

One day, a year after ""just another James movie"", Die Another Day, I noticed those movies starrin Brosman were no longer showing. They just stopped...Skip forward about 2 years later, I read somewhere that another James Bond movie called ""Casino Royale"" was to be released in 2006. First of all, not knowing much about the plot or what it was based on, I thought the title was pretty stupid (he has all these mysterious and dramatic titles like Die Another Day, From Russia with Love, Goldeneye, and Live and Let Die. Then he has this dead-obvious title, Casino Royale, which, in my opinion, made the plot pretty predictable.). Secondly, I noticed what the new actor looked like: blonde hair, EXTREMELY blue eyes, and didn't look near as muscular (at least with a shirt on) as previouse Bonds. I found out other details involving this actor: his name was Daniel Craig and he is against the use of guns! AGAINST THE USE OF GUNS!!!! I knew then that the series was pretty much doomed to end.Early reviews show up on the internet, and the ratings were, surprisingly, positive. Now interested in the fact that the movie tells of Bond's first ever mission for MI-6 as 007, I rented several earlier James Bond movies, which were Dr. No, Goldeneye, Live and Let Die, and Die Another Day, and was very impressed with all of them. James Bond had just gained a new fan. Opening night of Casino Royale came, and I was there. I was hooked all the end:The movie opens with James Bond talking about gaining 00 status to a man he kills a few minutes later while showing flashbacks of Bond fighting and killing another person who worked for the man who Bond was discussing 00 status with, all in black and white. This leads to James Bond's famous spin-around-and-shoot-through-a-barrel openning sequence. The theme music, ""You Know My Name"", is a nice change from the usual music you might hear in a nightclub, being much more fast-paced than the other films.When I walked out of the theater, I realized that each of the previouse Bonds each had a share of fatal flaws: Sean Connery was too hairy, Roger Moore was too comical and messed up alot, and Pierce Brosman seemed a little caught up in himself and got beat up alot. Daniel Craig portrayed a much-more-realistic agent who was still a flawed human, knew how to get the job done, and only made out with girls when he absolutely needed to, while still having the same ego and style as the original Bonds. Simply put it, this is the best James Bond film I have ever seen.",5,Bond Begins,1168732800,"01 14, 2007",2007,3109,"['started', 'out', 'being', 'not-so-big', '007', 'fan', 'knew', 'who', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'was', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'Last', 'Crusade', 'Pierce', 'Brosman', 'still', 'barely', 'remember', 'seing', 'Goldeneye', 'theatres', 'had', 'idea', 'who', 'George', 'Lazenby', 'even', 'Roger', 'Moore', 'was', 'knew', 'James', 'Bond', 'character', 'was', 'was', 'series', 'films', 'secret', 'agent', 'who', 'used', 'overly', 'suave', 'style', 'overpower', 'women', 'sometimes-failed', 'wits', 'overcome', 'outragouse', 'unbelievable', 'villain', 'Heck', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'were', 'based', 'novels', 'Ian', 'Flemming', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'much', 'James', 'Bond', '007', 'One', 'day', 'year', 'just', 'James', 'movie', 'Die', 'Day', 'noticed', 'movies', 'starrin', 'Brosman', 'were', 'no', 'longer', 'showing', 'just', 'stopped', 'Skip', 'forward', '2', 'years', 'later', 'read', 'somewhere', 'James', 'Bond', 'movie', 'called', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'was', 'be', 'released', '2006', 'First', 'all', 'not', 'knowing', 'much', 'plot', 'what', 'was', 'based', 'thought', 'title', 'was', 'pretty', 'stupid', 'mysterious', 'dramatic', 'titles', 'Die', 'Day', 'From', 'Russia', 'Love', 'Goldeneye', 'Live', 'Let', 'Die', 'Then', 'dead-obvious', 'title', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'opinion', 'made', 'plot', 'pretty', 'predictable.', 'Secondly', 'noticed', 'what', 'new', 'actor', 'looked', 'blonde', 'hair', 'EXTREMELY', 'blue', 'eyes', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'muscular', 'least', 'shirt', 'previouse', 'Bonds', 'found', 'out', 'other', 'details', 'involving', 'actor', 'name', 'was', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'use', 'guns', 'THE', 'USE', 'OF', 'GUNS', 'knew', 'then', 'series', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'doomed', 'end.Early', 'reviews', 'show', 'up', 'internet', 'ratings', 'were', 'surprisingly', 'positive', 'Now', 'interested', 'fact', 'movie', 'tells', 'Bond', 'first', 'ever', 'mission', 'MI-6', '007', 'rented', 'several', 'earlier', 'James', 'Bond', 'movies', 'were', 'Dr.', 'No', 'Goldeneye', 'Live', 'Let', 'Die', 'Die', 'Day', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'James', 'Bond', 'had', 'just', 'gained', 'new', 'fan', 'Opening', 'night', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'came', 'was', 'there', 'was', 'hooked', 'end', 'movie', 'James', 'Bond', 'talking', 'gaining', '00', 'status', 'man', 'few', 'minutes', 'later', 'showing', 'flashbacks', 'Bond', 'fighting', 'killing', 'person', 'who', 'worked', 'man', 'who', 'Bond', 'was', 'discussing', '00', 'status', 'black', 'white', 'James', 'Bond', 'famous', 'spin-around-and-shoot-through-a-barrel', 'openning', 'sequence', 'theme', 'music', 'Know', 'Name', 'nice', 'change', 'usual', 'music', 'might', 'hear', 'nightclub', 'being', 'much', 'more', 'fast-paced', 'other', 'films.When', 'walked', 'theater', 'realized', 'previouse', 'Bonds', 'had', 'share', 'fatal', 'flaws', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'was', 'too', 'hairy', 'Roger', 'Moore', 'was', 'too', 'comical', 'messed', 'up', 'alot', 'Pierce', 'Brosman', 'seemed', 'little', 'caught', 'up', 'got', 'beat', 'up', 'alot', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'portrayed', 'much-more-realistic', 'agent', 'who', 'was', 'still', 'flawed', 'human', 'knew', 'how', 'get', 'job', 'done', 'only', 'made', 'out', 'girls', 'when', 'absolutely', 'needed', 'still', 'having', 'same', 'ego', 'style', 'original', 'Bonds', 'Simply', 'put', 'best', 'James', 'Bond', 'film', 'have', 'ever', 'seen']",N/A

""The Movie Critic""","[3, 4]","If you've seen all the previous Bond movies, if you've read any of the bond novels by Ian Fleming, then this is just another action movie by our 21st century standards. Our ""NEW"" Bond (in my opinion) does NOT, I repeat does NOT capture the true flavor of the Bond personality. He's a fast shooter, but other than that, he didn't act like the bond we know. For example, he allowed himself to be poisened by a drink at the Casino (not careful enough for 007!). He over trusted his lady partner with millions of dollars. He's too serious and even harsh, no Bond usual charm. For the new generation that has not seen Sean Connery's best and Roger Moore's best and even Brosnan's best, this maybe a good action movie.

1048092,A25HYPL2XKQPZB,B000MNP2K8,Bill Garrison,"[7, 11]","Casino Royale stars a new Bond, played by Daniel Craig. Forget what your opinion is after viewing the commercials or reading the press, Craig is Bond through and through. Also, you'll view him as Bond, but you'll be able to separate him from the other actors. This movie is a reboot of the series. It takes you back to before Bond became the Bond we know and love. This movie shows his formation. The movie doesn't show Bond after Brosnan, it shows him before Connery. Starting with Goldeneye, I told myself that, ""man, that movie was awesome,"" because it was a Bond movie, and they just HAD to be awesome didn't they? Well, some of the recent ones were good. Some weren't (I haven't seen Die Another Day completely since the theaters.  It seems so cartoonish). Craig's Bond is different. He makes mistakes. He doesn't think things through. It's fun to see his mistakes and know the experienced Bond wouldn't do those things. At one moment, when it looks like Bond has failed, Bond is ready to strike back and kill, when common sense says he should do something else. Only other, more experienced spies can stop him, and they do.So, with the movie fresh on my mind, I think this is one of the best, and I think that opinion will hold up through time. For starters, this movie isn't about a laser pulse that can destroy electricity, an atomic bomb that will blow up Hong Kong or the oil supply, or a machine that can harness the sun. This movie is about a man who finances the world's terrorists and in order to raise money, he's hosting a poker game. It's a simple spy story. As said before, Craig is awesome. The one-liners and puns aren't as blatant as earlier movies, but Bond is still witty. He also cares a lot, is more human, and suffers some remorse at the actions his jobs call him to do. This Bond is on the verge. At times, he shows heart and compassion, and at times he can be cold blooded. The person that can draw him out is the beautiful Vesper Lynd, played by Eva Green. Eva Green is beautiful, as a scene shown where she stands in front of the mirror without makeup will prove, her face is perfect. (I caught a glimpse of her in the movie Dreamers on the Independent Film Channel, and the rest of her isn't bad either.) She is tough, yet vulnerable, and her character will leave a mark on you for awhile.Now, what makes this a great ""Bond"" movie, and not just a great action movie. As far as the action goes, it is great stuff. There are fights on cranes, in stairwells, in collapsing buildings and at airports. Bond fans will want to know, does the movie have the stuff that makes Bond movies great?Considering the music, and specifically the Bond theme, many people say Goldeneye is one of the best Bond movies. I specifically remember that movie as being one that went away from the traditional Bond theme. They didn't use it once! So while it might have been a good movie, it was a poor Bond movie. In this film, the Bond music is there, though not as much as usual. But you can expect that, because Bond doesn't become ""Bond"" until the end. The traditional ""gun-barrel"" opening is also a bond staple, something that usually opens every Bond film. This movie opens without it, and I was disappointed, but then it is showcased in a different way, and that makes it even better. As mentioned above, the wit is there, just not focused upon as much.This is an intense PG-13, movie. There is not any nudity, despite what the MPAA says. The language is fine, the violence is plentiful, but not gory. I echo other reviews I've read when I say I'm ready for a sequel. This is the kind of movie that could start a series, even if it was the first, not the 21st. I hope this movie makes gobs of money because it is that much better than Die Another Day.",5,"One of the best Bond movies ever, a great movie, Awesome!",1169683200,"01 25, 2007",2007,3763,"['Casino', 'Royale', 'new', 'Bond', 'played', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'Forget', 'what', 'opinion', 'viewing', 'commercials', 'reading', 'press', 'Craig', 'Bond', 'Also', ""'ll"", 'view', 'Bond', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'separate', 'other', 'actors', 'movie', 'reboot', 'series', 'back', 'Bond', 'became', 'Bond', 'know', 'love', 'movie', 'formation', 'movie', ""n't"", 'show', 'Bond', 'Brosnan', 'Connery', 'Starting', 'Goldeneye', 'told', 'man', 'movie', 'was', 'awesome', 'was', 'Bond', 'movie', 'just', 'HAD', 'be', 'awesome', 'did', ""n't"", 'Well', 'recent', 'ones', 'were', 'good', 'were', ""n't"", 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Die', 'Day', 'completely', 'theaters', 'so', 'cartoonish', 'Craig', 'Bond', 'different', 'mistakes', ""n't"", 'think', 'things', 'fun', 'see', 'mistakes', 'know', 'experienced', 'Bond', 'would', ""n't"", 'do', 'things', 'one', 'moment', 'when', 'Bond', 'failed', 'Bond', 'ready', 'strike', 'back', 'kill', 'when', 'common', 'sense', 'should', 'do', 'something', 'else', 'Only', 'other', 'more', 'experienced', 'spies', 'can', 'stop', 'do.So', 'movie', 'fresh', 'mind', 'think', 'one', 'best', 'think', 'opinion', 'will', 'hold', 'up', 'time', 'starters', 'movie', ""n't"", 'laser', 'pulse', 'can', 'destroy', 'electricity', 'atomic', 'bomb', 'will', 'blow', 'up', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'oil', 'supply', 'machine', 'can', 'harness', 'sun', 'movie', 'man', 'who', 'world', 'terrorists', 'order', 'raise', 'money', 'hosting', 'poker', 'game', 'simple', 'spy', 'story', 'said', 'Craig', 'awesome', 'one-liners', 'puns', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'blatant', 'earlier', 'movies', 'Bond', 'still', 'witty', 'also', 'lot', 'more', 'human', 'remorse', 'actions', 'jobs', 'call', 'do', 'Bond', 'verge', 'times', 'heart', 'compassion', 'times', 'can', 'be', 'cold', 'blooded', 'person', 'can', 'draw', 'out', 'beautiful', 'Vesper', 'Lynd', 'played', 'Eva', 'Green', 'Eva', 'Green', 'beautiful', 'scene', 'shown', 'where', 'front', 'mirror', 'makeup', 'will', 'prove', 'face', 'perfect', 'caught', 'glimpse', 'movie', 'Dreamers', 'Independent', 'Film', 'Channel', 'rest', ""n't"", 'bad', 'either', 'tough', 'yet', 'vulnerable', 'character', 'will', 'leave', 'mark', 'awhile.Now', 'what', 'great', 'Bond', 'movie', 'not', 'just', 'great', 'action', 'movie', 'As', 'far', 'action', 'great', 'stuff', 'are', 'fights', 'cranes', 'stairwells', 'collapsing', 'buildings', 'airports', 'Bond', 'fans', 'will', 'want', 'know', 'movie', 'have', 'stuff', 'Bond', 'movies', 'great', 'Considering', 'music', 'specifically', 'Bond', 'theme', 'many', 'people', 'say', 'Goldeneye', 'one', 'best', 'Bond', 'movies', 'specifically', 'remember', 'movie', 'being', 'one', 'went', 'away', 'traditional', 'Bond', 'theme', 'did', ""n't"", 'use', 'once', 'So', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'movie', 'was', 'poor', 'Bond', 'movie', 'film', 'Bond', 'music', 'there', 'though', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'usual', 'can', 'expect', 'Bond', ""n't"", 'become', 'Bond', 'end', 'traditional', 'gun-barrel', 'opening', 'also', 'bond', 'staple', 'something', 'usually', 'Bond', 'film', 'movie', 'was', 'disappointed', 'then', 'showcased', 'different', 'way', 'even', 'better', 'mentioned', 'wit', 'there', 'just', 'not', 'focused', 'much.This', 'intense', 'PG-13', 'movie', 'not', 'nudity', 'what', 'MPAA', 'language', 'fine', 'violence', 'plentiful', 'not', 'gory', 'echo', 'other', 'reviews', ""'ve"", 'read', 'when', 'say', ""'m"", 'ready', 'sequel', 'kind', 'movie', 'could', 'start', 'series', 'even', 'was', 'first', 'not', '21st', 'hope', 'movie', 'gobs', 'money', 'much', 'better', 'Die', 'Day']",N/A

I am a life long Bond fan, having seen and own, the movies and read books to accompany them. This doesn't make me any better than any other Bond fan, but I have an unflattering opinion of this train-wreck of a movie. I was disappointed when Pierce Brosnan stepped down as Bond, but I was willing to give Daniel Craig a shot at it. After all, I didn't think anyone could butcher the job the way Timothy Dalton did. Boy, oh boy. This movie could kill the franchise. Reinventing Bond is ludicrous. Taking out his calm, cool assuredness and replacing it with hot headed response, I shed a tear. Then the writers had Bond leave a beautiful woman in the middle of a passionate moment to chase her terrorist male counterpart. James Bond WOULD NEVER do that. A real Bond would spend the night with the lovely lady and give her a gentle kiss before giving chase. Taking Bond back to the rank of normal ""O"" status had me shaking my head. Bond playing Hold 'Em poker (a nod to a current fad)instead of his game of choice baccaratte. In fact, if you read the book, Bond is playing baccaratte... the movie guys changed it, obviously figuring that they knew Bond better than Ian Fleming. What idiots.Another thing. What was one of the best points of Bond movies? For me it is the ""over the top"" bad guys that Bond fights. They never showed up in this flick. Instead we got a bad guy who was a weeping sissy. He owed money to other bad guys and was playing poker to try and win the cash. Those bad guys probably should have been Bond's prey. The guy Bond chases is no super villian. He's all to human. He has asthma, shakes in the company of real bad guys and begs for mercy when caught.Does anyone remember Bond movies with real hokey contraptions that the meanies would put Bond into when they wanted him dispatched? This movie replaces those contraptions with a chair and a naked Bond getting hit in the genitals by a heavy rope?!?! (say what) Bond gets hit in those family jewels by none other than the weeping bad guy himself. No henchmen, no fortress, no Q, no fancy gadgets...

1048095,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B000MNP2K8,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[0, 2]","***CONTAINS SPOILERS***How did James Bond become a ""00"" agent? What makes him so good at his job and so distant to the beautiful women he often encounters? Wrap your mind around those questions and then go and see director Martin Campbell's latest Bond flick, CASINO ROYALE. That someone could pull off such a fantastic film whilst giving us the Bond-background is something of a marvel. Leave aside (for the moment) that Daniel Craig isn't as debonair as previous Bonds, and you just may enjoy Casino Royale on a level never before seen.It's simply a fact that Craig isn't the dashing, clean-cut, and uppity Bond audiences have come to expect. He's rougher, tougher, and a bit naive. He loves instead of lusts. He learns to kill with a conscious (in the beginning), but still delivers pithy lines (""That last hand nearly killed me."")The question of James Bond's beginnings have always been in question and Casino Royale gives them to us while also delivering the action, a few gadgets, a kick-butt automobile, and the curvaceous women we expect.Director Martin Campbell first cut his teeth on a Bond film with GOLDEN EYE in 1995, so he knows the lay of the land. He also went on to direct the stylish THE MASK OF ZORRO in 1998. From there his repertoire stammers with several duds, but came back in glaringly fine fashion with this year's Casino Royale.From the opening credits with its flashy and somewhat retro poker card graphics, to the black-and-white film stock beginning, audiences immediately realize they're in for something special. We quickly watch Bond make his first two kills, granting him access to his 007 status. Then we get to see him nearly ruin his career by causing an international crisis. From here he's sent on hiatus by M (Judi Dench, MRS. HENDERSON PRESENTS) to get his head together. But of course Bond never lets go of an assignment until it's finished. Continuing his international crisis across borders, he travels to a tropical island where he meets up with terrorists who are trying to advance their causes by selling bomb-making material. He meets up with one of the racketeers' wives in true Bond fashion. But the British Secret Service have their eyes on him and quickly find out what he's up to. They are forced to go along with Bond's plans to enter into a high-stakes poker game with the evil Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen, EXIT), a facially scarred and blood weeping villain who recently lost a ton of money because of Bond's interference in his ""business"". If Le Chiffre wins the $120 million game, he'll have enough money to get back into supporting bombers and bomb-makers.Bond also happens to be The Service's best card player, but he has to convince the penny pinchers of the British government that he's got a good chance of winning or they'll refuse to back him (if Bond loses the British will, in effect, be sponsoring terrorism). Enter Vesper Lynd (Eva Green, KINGDOM OF HEAVEN), a government finance agent who agrees to give James Bond the money to enter the tournament. As the cards fall, so does Bond's chances. As all appears hopeless, Bond wins the tournament, thus crushing Le Chiffre's chances at re-entering terrorist haven, and threatening his very existence because he's lost all of his financing given to him by the dark forces of the world (they'll obviously want their money back at some point and now Le Chiffre is broke). Obviously Le Chiffre is none to happy about Bond winning and kidnaps him and Vesper.By now Bond has grown very fond of Vesper and they form a relationship unheard of in terms of Bondom. He confesses his love for her and eventually (after a dizzying and testicularly funny escape from the clutches of death), agrees to leave the Queen's Service in order to live a life of love and happiness with her. But all Bond fans know this cannot be. A sense of terrible foreboding grips the film as Bond learns the true nature of Vesper.It's wonderful to see how all of this effects James Bond and how it coalesces to help form the Ian Fleming character we've all grown up with. Vesper, through Bond's love of her and her betrayal of him, helps turn James into the tough-loving, womanizer we all know. This betrayal also lets us see why James Bond doesn't trust anyone and prefers to work solo.So Daniel Craig being a bit rougher around the edges in appearance actually fit the script nicely. He IS rougher. He IS tougher. And he IS the Bond we've come to enjoy.(Note: Caution to all those who get this when it comes out on DVD.

Oh, how wrong I was. Craig plays Bond with confidence and gives him exactly the rigth mixture of elegance and brutishness. We must keep in mind that Craigs Bond is new to the game, rough, tough, adventurous and most importantly, human. He is not yet the suave ladykiller we all know and love. He's still learning his trade.I think the producers were very clever in distancing themselves from the smooth Bond from the past. We're not only dealing with a new Bond actor, but an entirely different kind of movies alltogether. The last few Bond films have been nothing more than flat (and really not funny) one liners and loads upon loads of gadgets. Too far fetched really. This new film is delightfully gadget-free and delivers clever dialogue, funny as well as impressive and dramatic moments and most importantly: it has a more realistic feeling to it than the latest of the Bond movies. You believe it could happen.This is partially acomplished by making the fightscenes very rough and tough (and beautifully choreographed) instead of the usual ""judo chop"". Also making Bond a proper soldier and a proper gentleman instead of the super suave super agent gives credibility. He is not afraid of getting dirty and leans on his physique rather than savvy when encontering problems.Daniel Craig plays the role to perfection and the supporting cast also delivers beautiful performances, especially Dame Judy Dench as M is very good.

As much as I liked Connery, Moore, and Brosnan, and all delivered good performances, none of them seemed like sudden death with a bad attitude. For a government assassin, such an attitude would be helpful.Daniel Craig sells that attitude convincingly. From the very start where he coolly terminates a traitor, to the very end where shoots a foe through the leg when it is clear he didn't have to, you know this Bond is cool about the job of dealing death.The movie itself? I think of it as three movies in one. It starts as an action flick, segues into a cool spy mode with a very relaxed and long lasting poker tournament, and then gets back to the action again.Although this movie does have scenes that remind you of the book, it is not a close cover of the book in the way the first few Connery movies were.Altogether quite enjoyable, and closer to the way I perceived Bond as I read the books than most of the other Bond actors managed.The DVD presentation meets current standards well.

1048101,AVOCNUFOXUCA6,B000MNP2K8,Brian A. Schar,"[0, 2]","""Casino Royale"" is a re-imagining of James Bond, a reboot of a tired old franchise.  James Bond has been a cartoon for decades, epitomized by Roger Moore and to some extent Timothy Dalton.  In its place, Craig's Bond is part Jason Bourne, part Terminator.  (Just watch him run like Robert Patrick at the beginning!)  ""Casino Royale"" is grittier, less cartoony and still big and action-oriented.Craig is a decent if not great Bond, but the fault of Bond in this movie lies not with him but with poor writing.  The viewer will note that this Bond screws everything up and does nothing right, and even has to be rescued at times.  This is not the supremely confident, always-prepared Bond we are used to.  Nonetheless, the first part of the movie is serviceable and competent, and at least watchable.But ""Casino Royale"" completely derails on the train to Montenegro, where Bond meets his Bond girl and the movie hits a brick wall.  Action transforms into a lot of pseudo-romantic chatter between the two.  Eva Green turns in a truly legendary performance as a Bond girl.  Legendary, in the sense that the acting bar for Bond girls is set pretty low, and she doesn't even make it that high.  Due in part to poor writing and in greater part to exceptionally poor Bond girl acting, her last scene in the movie is laugh-out-loud funny rather than dramatic.I will not spoil the ending, such as it is, but its open-ended lack of closure caused me to knock off a star.  Come on, this movie is 2 and a half hours long, and they couldn't have cleared out 45 minutes of look-at-my-watch yapping in order to give us 5 minutes worth of closure?I noted to my wife that Montenegro sure looked a lot like Italy, and that maybe we should visit someday.  However, do not use ""Casino Royale"" for travel planning purposes, as the credits reveal that Lake Como, Italy stood in for Montenegro.

1048103,AWNKEM8DAG8PY,B000MNP2K8,Brian Conway,"[1, 3]","Grammatically idiotic though it may be, the initial catchphrase for Casino Royale ""James becomes Bond"" is a pretty accurate descriptor for the movie. The film works as a reboot button, similar to Batman Begins, taking the character of James Bond back to his very first mission as MI6 agent 007. There's been a lot of hype surrounding this movie promising that this gritty, modern interpretation of Ian Fleming's classic secret agent will give a second wind to a series that has been struggling for years. Thankfully, Casino Royale doesn't disappoint. Daniel Craig does an excellent job of portraying Bond and he infuses the character with the rough edges that one would expect a novice ""double O"" to have. Bond's ego and arrogant recklessness provide many of the close calls that he very narrowly avoids; these scenes add a human element that has been missing in many of the Bond films. Bond's humanity is even more apparent in the ruthless manner he uses to get the job done, especially when compared to the typical, cold-blooded killing that he exercises later in his career. This new side of Bond hints at many layers of unexplored depth that make his character something far more interesting than the walking punch-line machine that he had become in previous installments. The villain, Le Chiffre (played by Mads Mikkelsen), is a more reined-in version of the madmen that Bond usually encounters thanks to the wise decision of skipping on the more camp elements for which the series' villains had become notorious. The battle that Le Chiffre and Bond have over a game of high-stakes poker provides the most tense moments of the movie, a scene that is sure to be loved by all Bond fans eager to see James back in playboy mode. Eva Green, though nothing out of the ordinary for a Bond girl, is just interesting enough as Vesper Lynd to make the audience care for her; her character is one of a handful of people that play a vital role in making Bond the gentleman spy that people know and love. The overall picture is wonderful but it's the smaller moments, such as Bond's birth as 007 and how he earns his first Aston Martin, that help make this installation, and Daniel Craig, the best Bond since Connery.",4,Casino Royale (4 stars),1163894400,"11 19, 2006",2006,2209,"['Grammatically', 'idiotic', 'may', 'be', 'initial', 'catchphrase', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'James', 'Bond', 'pretty', 'accurate', 'descriptor', 'movie', 'film', 'reboot', 'button', 'similar', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'taking', 'character', 'James', 'Bond', 'back', 'very', 'first', 'mission', 'MI6', 'agent', '007', 'been', 'lot', 'hype', 'surrounding', 'movie', 'promising', 'gritty', 'modern', 'interpretation', 'Ian', 'Fleming', 'classic', 'secret', 'agent', 'will', 'give', 'second', 'wind', 'series', 'been', 'struggling', 'years', 'Thankfully', 'Casino', 'Royale', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'excellent', 'job', 'portraying', 'Bond', 'character', 'rough', 'edges', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'novice', 'double', 'O', 'have', 'Bond', 'ego', 'arrogant', 'recklessness', 'provide', 'many', 'close', 'very', 'narrowly', 'avoids', 'scenes', 'add', 'human', 'element', 'been', 'missing', 'many', 'Bond', 'films', 'Bond', 'humanity', 'even', 'more', 'apparent', 'ruthless', 'manner', 'get', 'job', 'done', 'especially', 'when', 'compared', 'typical', 'cold-blooded', 'killing', 'later', 'career', 'new', 'side', 'Bond', 'hints', 'many', 'layers', 'unexplored', 'depth', 'make', 'character', 'something', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'walking', 'punch-line', 'machine', 'had', 'become', 'previous', 'installments', 'villain', 'Le', 'Chiffre', 'played', 'Mads', 'Mikkelsen', 'more', 'reined-in', 'version', 'madmen', 'Bond', 'usually', 'thanks', 'wise', 'decision', 'skipping', 'more', 'camp', 'elements', 'series', 'villains', 'had', 'become', 'notorious', 'battle', 'Le', 'Chiffre', 'Bond', 'have', 'over', 'game', 'high-stakes', 'poker', 'most', 'tense', 'moments', 'movie', 'scene', 'sure', 'be', 'loved', 'Bond', 'fans', 'eager', 'see', 'James', 'back', 'playboy', 'mode', 'Eva', 'Green', 'nothing', 'ordinary', 'Bond', 'girl', 'just', 'interesting', 'enough', 'Vesper', 'Lynd', 'make', 'audience', 'care', 'character', 'one', 'handful', 'people', 'play', 'vital', 'role', 'making', 'Bond', 'gentleman', 'people', 'know', 'love', 'overall', 'picture', 'wonderful', 'smaller', 'moments', 'such', 'Bond', 'birth', '007', 'how', 'first', 'Aston', 'Martin', 'help', 'make', 'installation', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'best', 'Bond', 'Connery']",N/A

1048105,A6WZVL0SRQAPY,B000MNP2K8,Brian Driver,"[0, 0]","Until this movie, when I thought of James Bond I pictured Sean Connery.  I'm 60, and I remember standing in lines that spread around a city block to seeGoldfinger, and I never thought there could be anybody else who could play Bond.Since then the chain of Bond films became synonymous with stunt-oriented, fantastical tales full of whimsy, exotic locales, and girls, girls, girls.  Bond himself became defined only by the particular villain he chased down, and there was a certain mass-produced feel to each of the post-Goldfinger era.Though still a popular and cash-worthy entity, Bond had become a franchise; the films became increasingly silly, and the only really interesting patter about them became who was going to be the new Bond this year.Then along came Daniel Craig, and 007 came alive once again.The most remarkable and successful aspect of ""Casino Royale"" is that, after twenty films in the Eon line its producers decided to use it to reboot of the Bond legend.  Like the newStar Trek (2009)(minus the temporal window, of course), this movie is the beginning of the next phase of the secret agent's legend. Another likeable quality is that, for the first time in years, a Bond movie plot can be followed in one viewing.  Certainly there are twists and turns, but this is no serpentine movie defying the viewer to follow it.And, as there is no mention made of the previous films or characters within them--save M (his boss) and Felix Leiter (his American CIA counterpart)--our Bond is free to kick start the mythology anew--in fact, one of the most amusing segments of this film occurs when the spy becomes eager to find an alcoholic drink he likes.  After several false starts he quickly orders a vodka martini, but the bartender has no idea Bond is at that moment under great stress, and when the server asks if he would prefer it shaken or stirred, our spy snaps, ""Do I look like a man who gives a damn?""That this is a remaking of the 007 legend becomes clear at the precise moment the movie starts: shot in black-and-white, the first scenes depicts Bond's attainment of his double-0 status through the removal of a traitorous double-agent.  It is made clear immediately that this Bond is a no-nonsense creation; a thug being polished into a highly trained spy.When the film returns to color we find 007 assigned to Madagascar, where has to chase down a spy who has been accidentally alerted by another agent's foolish mistake, and a thrilling parkour chase once again confirms that this Bond means business.  While their target colorfully and gracefully runs like a gazelle, wending his way through a building by ballet-like leaps and agile maneuvers, Craig's Bond smashes through boards and wire fences like the Hulk.It is this aspect which Daniel Craig portrays so well.  He is a lean, hungry Bond, quick-witted and clever, yes...but he has the persona actors like Steve McQueen conveyed so well: a quality that quite clearly said that he is not to be intimidated or outdone.  He is, indeed, a brute who can wear a fitted suit and pass for a sophisticate, but just as the excellent opening theme song (by Chris Cornell of Soundgarden and Audioslave) informs anyone opposing him: ""the coldest blood runs through (his) veins.""Bond has always had a contentious quality about him toward any of those who would be seen as ""above"" him, but it was almost always playful and non-threatening.  Craig's Bond goes a little further: he is a man whose anti-authoritarian chip-on-the-shoulder smugness runs quite definitely in opposition to those who are attempting to control his actions.  In fact, this will be a quality that will fuel the new trio of movies made at the time of this review.  M (played by Dame Judi Dench, the only remnant from the films preceding this movie) is in fact quite ruffled by his presence, and constantly seeks to upbraid him for insubordination.  Yet, even when he breaks into her apartment and hacks into her computer, she does little other to him than give him a tongue lashing. She has her eye on this agent, to be sure, but it is clear the thought has occurred to her that they might just have created a loose cannon.There is scarcely a ""down"" moment in the movie, and some scenes are truly spectacular.  Bond's saving of a new airplane prototype is as physical and rough and tumble as they come, featuring not only his prowess with his fists, but also other athletic feats as rough and tumble as, say, Harrison Ford's Indiana Jones.  There is some price to be paid, however, in the new films: after the airplane escapade Bond is debriefed by M in the Bahamas, and his body is riddled with wounds, scrapes, cuts and bruises...and this is NOTHING compared to what he will go through soon.There are many terrific battles, but the one for which the film is titled is a high stakes card game that involves Bond and LeChiffre, a criminal financier who is trying a last-ditch effort to avoid bankruptcy by backing a winner-take-all poker game.  Our side's plan? To bankroll Bond and have him destroy LeChiffre, at which point his creditors come after him and he's left with only one option: our protection.Of course, the game is exciting, and there are several scenes that let us know how vital these games are.  Suffice it to say that there are several deaths...and one of them is Bond (watch the film!).Yet there is more than one climax in this film, and our Bond is not done--not even when an anguished LeChiffre has broken loose and decides to torture a naked Bond in a manner that, well...  Let's say his voice will never reach the low notes again.But, as one might guess, Bond wins the day, and to continue speaking about the plot would be to tell too much, only that what happens is important enough to supply the next film with its driving force.My main bullet point, therefore, is that ""Casino Royale"" is a terrific and intelligent movie.  If you have ever seen a disappointing Bond film, be reassured: he is back in form again.  James Bond is no longer a silly, quipping fop whose main sources of derring do are doing things that warrant words like ""derring do.""And I, for one, am glad.",5,Bond Lives On!,1358294400,"01 16,

1048107,A2CZPM110DW516,B000MNP2K8,"Brian W. Fairbanks ""Brian W. Fairbanks""","[2, 2]","Not since the glory days of ""Goldfinger"" and ""Thunderball"" has a 007 film received the kind of sterling reviews that greeted 2006's ""Casino Royale."" Roger Ebert gave it a whopping four stars, and Entertainment Weekly recently included it in a countdown of the best movies of the past 25 years.Is it that good?Although it was produced by EON productions, the same company founded by Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman in 1961 to produce the Bond films and now in the hands of Broccoli's daughter Barbara and stepson Michael Wilson, ""Casino Royale"" is what's known as a ""rebooting"" in the same vein as Warner Bros.' ""Batman Begins."" Based on Ian Fleming's first Bond novel published in 1953, it begins with Bond earning his double agent status then embarking on his first mission. However, the film has a contemporary setting with Bond and his cohorts using laptop computers and cell phones. In other words, 007's previous adventures against such adversaries as Dr. No, Goldfinger, and Ernst Stavro Blofeld have yet to take place. Does this mean that remakes are in the offing?Daniel Craig, the sixth Bond of the official series, also represents a break with the past. He brings to mind Steve McQueen more than Sean Connery. You get the impression that Craig's Bond could hold his own in a fight with Connery but feel less confident, intimidated by Connery's cooler, more sophisticated manner. On the other hand, he would probably mock Roger Moore's gentlemanly agent and regard Pierce Brosnan as more playboy than killer. Craig's Bond is more of an alley cat, more at home in the gutter than the casino at which he stares down the villainous LeChiffre. He may be heroic, but he's far from fearless. He perspires and faces death with genuine terror. When he tosses off a witticism, as he rarely does, it's not with the nonchalance we have come to expect but with a sigh of relief, a means of breaking the tension. When this Bond's car flips over multiple times, he's bloody and barely conscious as his enemies drag him from the vehicle for a hair raising session of torture. Roger Moore would have calmly climbed out of the car, tightened the knot in his tie, and moved on.The critical acclaim accorded this new Bond is justified. It's an all-together excellent show, but I can't help but detect a certain amount of condescension toward the earlier films, as if to suggest this one is superior and more innovative than the more fantasy oriented adventures that, with few exceptions, preceded it. It is nothing of the sort. While the earlier Bond films with their megalomaniacal madmen plotting the takeover of the world did grow stale after a time, they were innovative when first released and grew tired only after being endlessly recycled in later chapters in the series and by the imitations that sprang up in the wake of ""Bondmania.""In the `60s, when Bond reigned supreme as the world's biggest box-office draw, his only competition came from the lesser spies given life to cash in on 007's success. Now, of course, we have Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Batman, Superman, Spider Man, et al, special effects heavy films that never would have made it to the big screen had Bond not arrived there first. But unlike them, Bond doesn't need the gimmicks and the fancy hardware and can stand apart from them. He has a secret weapon more effective than anything that Q could provide. He has Ian Fleming whose original conception of Bond has only rarely made it to the screen intact. Now he has. This isn't a better Bond, though, only a different one, as interesting in his own way as the previous 007s were in theirs.Brian W.

The megalomaniac adversaries who have billions of dollars and hundreds of private soldiers in silver lame` but not the common sense to simply have Bond shot on sight, the flying/floating/submersible Bond car that's tricked out with an assortment of the highest of hi-tech gadgets, etc. always seemed silly and shallow to me. I think one of the reasons Michael Myers' Austin Powers character was such a success was because he did an excellent job satirizing the implausibilities and tacky nonsense of Bond movies.Now, with that being said, let me tell you that CASINO ROYALE is a great movie that I very much enjoyed. I don't know but I've been told that this movie and Daniel Craig's Bond is the closest ever to the character in Ian Fleming's books. It was interesting how this movie offered some explanation on the origins of a few things surrounding the Bond myth, like 007's predilection for Aston Martins and his trademark martini - shaken, not stirred. Most importantly, however, it also delved into Bond's disposable treatment of women. Early on, an alluring Mediterranean woman, who could easily have become the next ""Oh James!"" cooing 'Bond Girl,' gets  killed, to be replaced with a more mature and independent female lead character.Craig's Bond is a complex character; stylish yet gritty, brutal but human. Not since Sean Connery has the franchise had such a believable 007. Bond's target too is more realistic this time around. CASINO ROYALE has no Dr. Evils living in underwater fortresses surrounded by legions of mercenaries. Instead, the adversary here is a much more menacing figure in today's world: a man who offers his investment and holding services for terrorist money.The ending assures us that James Bond will be back.

Craig makes the role his own. This is a whole new Bond. The cliche is that this movie is Bond for the 21st century (the terrorist angle), when it actually just brings Bond back to his roots. He is cunning more than he is charming. (unlike Roger Moore) He is different, he is new, he reinvents what you think a secret agent in her Majesty's secret service should be.If you are looking for the trademark Bond staples such as the Martini (shaken, not stirred) - the easy women, the endless supply of Aston Martins etc... this movie may disappoint. Craig is rough around the edges but just smooth enough to make you believe that he deserves to be the newest ""double-oh"".I suggest buying this DVD in 1080p Blu-Ray because of the spectacular cinematography, shot on location in Prague.

You give the world of Bond a curveball. You keep the spirit of Bond; the ladies man, the gadgets, the high risk stunts, the adrenaline pumping action, the bow tie, the suit and the cars, but you give the man a new personality.

We have numerous changes in the actor, but the personality of the character is always the same. CASINO ROYALE kept most of the character of Bond, but with Daniel Craig, they've given the series an adrenaline jolt with an unlikely Bond and a slightly skewed Bond.The first twenty minutes takes you into the fast paced, well-thought out thrill ride and introduces you to a character who isn't as clean cut as the suit may suggest.

1048130,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000MNP2K8,Chris Pandolfi,"[6, 8]","James Bond has always been a shallow figure, so super suave and so heavily stylized, yet completely lacking in substance. At last, we have a film that gives Agent 007 some depth and complexity; it's called ""Casino Royale,"" and while it isn't a perfect film, it's still a far cry from some of the overly ambitious early attempts in the franchise. It's an action film, yet the story isn't drowned out in wall-to-wall stunts. It's a mystery, yet the twists and turns aren't piled on top of each other. It's even a love story, yet it isn't sappy or melodramatic. This is the James Bond movie I've been waiting for: a pleasing blend of classic intrigue, danger, suspense, and sexuality in a plot that--true to the Spy Film genre--isn't even remotely plausible. What a fun, fun movie this was.This is the first Bond film in many years that's actually based on an Ian Fleming novel. I can't say whether or not that made it worth seeing; I've never read anything he's written, and I can't compare them to the other twenty Bond films. But I can say that this story hit all the right notes, both as an action film and as a character analysis. I could describe in detail what the film is about, but does it really matter? All you need to know is that it's a prequel, and it covers Bond's very first mission. The long and short of it is that he has to prevent a banker from winning at a casino tournament in Montenagro; the prize money will only go towards funding terrorist activities. Specifically what activities are never alluded to, but that's irrelevant. We all know that terrorism, in any form, should be stopped.Early on in the film, Bond says, ""I understand double-ohs have a very short life expectancy."" How true: the character is now played by Daniel Craig, the sixth actor to assume the role (following a long and fairly mediocre run with Pierce Brosnan). This new portrayal gives Bond a different dimension, one that helps to define him more as a person and less as a debonair drone. Craig definitely gives him a suave demeanor, and to say he isn't physically attractive would be a bold-faced lie. Yet there's an underlying ruggedness to this new James Bond, one that replaces some of the more pristine Bonds of the past. His face shows some wear, as if to say that he's seen plenty of action. He's even capable of making mistakes, as seen during the casino tournament when he incorrectly assumes the tactics of his opponent.Noticeably absent from ""Casino Royale"" are the wealth of over the top gadgets and gizmos; the best we're given are a couple of guns and a few miscellaneous items in the glove compartment of a sports car (including a defibrillator, which will eventually come in handy). I liked this; for once, Bond will have to use his wits and physical strength as opposed to ridiculous science fiction-grade props to gain the upper hand. There are no watches with built in lasers or pens that fire tiny darts. There's no eject button for his car's driver's side seat. There's no hidden radio in his cufflinks. Of course, such a change also required the absence of Q (first played by Desmond Llewelyn, then played by John Cleese). He could always be counted on for a bit of comedy relief.But I see this as a good thing; this time around, comedy relief wasn't needed. Small doses of appropriately timed humor were scattered all throughout the film, and not just from one character. It was an especially welcome change for Judi Dench to be given a couple funny lines; M was always such a serious character, and she definitely needed to lighten up. In ""Casino Royale,"" she's initially portrayed as being very hesitant around Bond, especially since his ego caused him to mess up a few very important missions. He even breaks into her apartment, not to steal anything, but simply to speak to her face to face. She finds such an act untrustworthy, and she's understandably worried about his success at the casino tournament.Interestingly enough, those moments in the casino are the best the film has to offer, despite being relatively quiet and low key. Bond plays against Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen), the film's lead villain. Despite the fact that he says and does little, he's probably one of the coldest villains ever seen in a Bond film. He sits across from 007 with an expression that you'd swear would turn you to stone (if it weren't for the fact that his left eye has an injured tear duct, resulting in tears of blood). He fiddles with his poker chips intensely yet carefully. He makes grandiose bets that he knows Bond will attempt to outdo. There's calculation going through this man's mind, and it was fascinating to watch him at that table (it was also fascinating to watch him during an especially uncomfortable torture scene). If it weren't for the fact that he doesn't fit the usual profile of a Bond villain, that he doesn't have a secret lair rigged with electronic booby traps, and that he doesn't have an exotic pet, then I'd say he would appeal to those looking for a classic bad guy.And then there's Vesper Lynd (Eva Green), an accoutant and the inevitable love interest. She and Bond play off each other perfectly, with one initially finding the other's personality flaws irritating. Yet there's a definite attraction, made stronger by the mission they're to complete together. She eventually awakens within Bond a desire, one that allows him to see her as a person as opposed to a sexual object (and we all know that James Bond is notoriously sexual). After a while, she, too, beings to see him in a different light. At that point, we can't help but wonder what would happen if the world's greatest secret agent were to settle down, marry, and possibly have a family. Can anyone picture such a circumstance? Of course they can't; James Bond is a man of action, dedicated to service but attached to no one.This is the kind of complexity I've always wanted to see, and I'm glad the filmmakers of ""Casino Royale"" decided to make use of it. I'm also glad that it was balanced with a couple of good action sequences; yes, each one is over the top and completely unrealistic, but they're so entertaining that the little details aren't even noticed. Of course no one can jump off of a hundred-foot crane and live to tell the tale. Of course you can't shoot at someone while leaping in mid air. Of course such bodily harm would result in debilitating injuries. No one thought about such things while watching the other James Bond movies, so why start now? This is a worthy addition to the 007 franchise; I can only hope that future additions will be as good.",4,"A ""Royale"" Treat",1163980800,"11 20, 2006",2006,6577,"['James', 'Bond', 'always', 'been',

1048131,A3I7OX03X6KDMN,B000MNP2K8,"Chris Roberts ""Chris Roberts""","[7, 10]","For once James Bond appears to be modern. A character who has spent most of his existence with a wooden, Ken doll personality finally, in the hands of Daniel Craig, has joined the rest of us in the year 2007. Of course Bond can never be as edgy as say, XXXX, Craig's character from ""Layer Cake"" the film that won him this most prestigious role. This is, after all, a franchise built upon a foundation of bling so anything the least bit offensive most be removed. And yet still they found a way to flesh this Bond out with humor and bravado. ""Shaken not stirred"" may have won them over many moons ago, but today our audiences demand more, they demand sexual innuendo with their ostentatious action set pieces. And Craig delivers, creating a Bond we can believe in, even when he is stealing cars and fornicating other people's girlfriends on the floor.At the center of this good, but not great, film is a poker game in Montenegro. We are back at the beginning of Bond's career (although the setting is modern day) and he is one of those shameless self-promoters who is looking to move up the ladder as quickly as possible. After an awe inspiring opening chase scene Bond is sent into the high stakes poker game (because he is the best, duh) with hopes of shutting down La Chiffre, a known terrorist. If he loses he has to live with himself knowing that he helped finance terrorism to the hefty tune of $10 million. Now poker isn't really my game so there is a chance that some of the nuisances of the game itself were lost on me. Stopping short of having an ESPN announce team in the house, Bond's co-conspirator Vesper works as the Greek Chorus filling in the poker simpletons (such as myself) and letting them know what is transpiring. ""Rounders"" made poker actually look exciting, but this film has no such trick up its sleeve. More than anything the central game works best as a way to slow down the pace of the film and in the process keeps it afloat.To watch this film back to back with the one that preceded it, ""Die Another Day"", would be to not believe that the came from the same genre much less the same series. Pierce Brosnan looked the park, especially when driving cars and acting cool, but I'm pretty sure I could beat him up. Daniel Craig would wipe the floor with me and that represents a major upgrade in that department. ""Casino Royale"" has its feet planted firmly on the ground and is helped along greatly by director Martin Campbell who can actually direct action sequences. ""Die Another Day"", with its embarrassment of a climax, was nothing more than special effects and fantasy lands, where somehow Bond ends up driving this uncrashable car through an ice palace. Oh, it is so bad. The old complaints about Bond refuse to go away however: plots are predictable, it doesn't have a thought in its head, and it represents commercialism above all. And still, for once, I am going to recommend a Bond film. It didn't give me whiplash and I am secure in the notion that Bond can once again clean my clock.

But there's something about Bond...When the Bond movies are at their best (Goldfinger,Licence To Kill,On Her Majesty's Secret Service - 2-Disc Ultimate Edition,Thunderball), they are among the best films ever made. Roger Ebert even put ""Goldfinger"" on his list of Great Films. When they're bad, however, they can really stink up the joint.Moonrakeranyone? Yeah, I thought not.Given the way the franchise had been leaning in the last few films (invisible car, anyone?), rebooting it was, perhaps, the only really course of action. Thank goodness when they rebooted it, they did a great job!This is a VERY good film. Excellent action sequences, a tight plot, good acting and beautiful scenery (even though it wasn't filmed in Montenegro, which is a pity). The villain, while certainly unpleasant and weird, isn't nearly as unrealistic as some of the other Bond bad guys, and his plans are much more interesting than, say, world domination.Daniel Craig makes for an excellent Bond. I would say, just on this one movie, that he is, thus far, almost as good, if not actually as good, as Connery.

1048139,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000MNP2K8,"Cloud ""...""","[2, 6]","Despite the fact it's almost unanimous that Sean Connery is everyone's favorite Bond, for some there's just the case of the era you happened to catch. Some are old enough to remember the Connery era while others were introduced to Bond thanks to Roger Moore. For me it was Pierce Brosnan in Goldeneye, which is still one of my favorite Bond films, that brought me into the 007 world. However, the series needed a serious revamp when it was filled with awful one-liners, over-the-top action scenes and a campiness that was hard to shake off. Taking a cue from the Batman restart, Casino Royale also restarts the series by showing not only a more serious agent, but a better approach.Just getting his ""00"" status, James Bond is a bit arrogant and has a case for letting his ego letting the best of him. His mission is to stop the man, Le Chiffre, a poker fanatic who helps finance world terrorists. Instead of blowing things up left and right, Bond instead goes into a high-stakes poker game and make Le Chiffre lose all his money and make him easier to apprehend. Sent to look after Bond and finance him in the poker game is Vesper Lynd, who Bond starts to fall for and drop his guard. He'll find the world of espionage a difficult life, especially when it comes to separating emotion from the mission.First of all, I have 2 knocks against the film: I'm not the greatest fan of the theme song ""You Know My Name"", performed by Chris Cornell. Then again I didn't like the last 3 songs anyway but even though it fits with the darker atmosphere the film has, I just don't like it as a song. The other is the actual poker game itself: it's just too slow. It takes a good half an hour when it starts and when we find out the winner and while it does have some action in-between, he just feels like a good 15 minute scene stretched twice as long. It's not enough to completely knock the film down a point and it is important to the overall story, it just should've been better edited.Now the big question: how's the new Bond? Like Christian Bale taking over the Dark Knight, Craig just seems like a perfect choice. While he's arguably the less pleasing Bond aesthetically, he's got that wit and charm that he should have, while also having that action hero we expect. He seems more intense and withdrawn than any of them have had. That isn't a knock against the more charming Connery, or the actor-y Timothy Dalton but Craig just has a more loose cannon feel he should've been all along. As for the action, it's quite exciting because it's grounded in reality. Outrunning a satellite beam in a car that can turn invisible just feels too silly while Bond hanging on for life on a speeding airport vehicle set to blow up is more exciting. Also the big opening set-piece, a physics-defying foot chase looks awesome but it also looks slightly comical since you keep thinking that guy should've broken his bones already.Like the Departed, this is probably the skinniest ""2 Disc special edition"" I've ever seen. It's basically got 3 featurettes: a look at Daniel Craig's announcement and start as the new Bond, a surprisingly entertaining look at the Bond girls with Maryam D'Abo being our main host and a look at the stunts being more real rather than using CG. You can obviously tell that a bigger release is coming since there just seems to be a lot missing. A commentary would've been nice, or a breakdown of the action scenes; something, anything. But at least the stuff we have is interesting and worth a look but all of a sudden, it just stops and you feel there's more to explore.Bet a lot of naysayers sure felt sheepish when this came out. More serious, brutal and just all around better, it's great to see Bond as the agent men wanted to be and women wanted to be with...and do.",5,Bond as he was meant to be: exciting and awesome,1173916800,"03 15, 2007",2007,3775,"['fact', 'almost', 'unanimous', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'everyone', 'favorite', 'Bond', 'just', 'case', 'era', 'happened', 'catch', 'are', 'old', 'enough', 'remember', 'Connery', 'era', 'others', 'were', 'introduced', 'Bond', 'thanks', 'Roger', 'Moore', 'was', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'Goldeneye', 'still', 'one', 'favorite', 'Bond', 'films', 'brought', '007', 'world', 'However', 'series', 'needed', 'serious', 'revamp', 'when', 'was', 'filled', 'awful', 'one-liners', 'over-the-top', 'action', 'scenes', 'campiness', 'was', 'hard', 'shake', 'off', 'Taking', 'cue', 'Batman', 'restart', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'also', 'series', 'showing', 'not', 'only', 'more', 'serious', 'agent', 'better', 'approach.Just', 'getting', '00', 'status', 'James', 'Bond', 'bit', 'arrogant', 'case', 'letting', 'ego', 'letting', 'best', 'mission', 'stop', 'man', 'Le', 'Chiffre', 'poker', 'fanatic', 'who', 'finance', 'world', 'terrorists', 'Instead', 'blowing', 'things', 'up', 'left', 'right', 'Bond', 'instead', 'high-stakes', 'poker', 'game', 'make', 'Le', 'Chiffre', 'lose', 'money', 'make', 'easier', 'apprehend', 'Sent', 'look', 'Bond', 'finance', 'poker', 'game', 'Vesper', 'Lynd', 'who', 'Bond', 'fall', 'drop', 'guard', ""'ll"", 'find', 'world', 'espionage', 'difficult', 'life', 'especially', 'when', 'separating', 'emotion', 'mission.First', 'have', '2', 'knocks', 'film', ""'m"", 'not', 'greatest', 'fan', 'theme', 'song', 'Know', 'Name', 'performed', 'Chris', 'Cornell', 'Then', 'again', 'did', ""n't"", 'last', '3', 'songs', 'anyway', 'even', 'darker', 'film', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'song', 'other', 'actual', 'poker', 'game', 'just', 'too', 'slow', 'good', 'half', 'hour', 'when', 'when', 'find', 'out', 'winner', 'have', 'action', 'in-between', 'just', 'feels', 'good', '15', 'minute', 'scene', 'stretched', 'twice', 'as', 'long', 'not', 'enough', 'completely', 'knock', 'film', 'down', 'point', 'important', 'overall', 'story', 'just', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', 'edited.Now', 'big', 'question', 'how', 'new', 'Bond', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'taking', 'over', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Craig', 'just', 'perfect', 'choice', 'arguably', 'less', 'pleasing', 'Bond', 'aesthetically', 'got', 'wit', 'charm', 'should', 'have', 'also', 'having', 'action', 'hero', 'expect', 'more', 'intense', 'withdrawn', 'have', 'had', ""n't"", 'knock', 'more', 'charming', 'Connery', 'actor-y', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'Craig', 'just', 'more', 'loose', 'cannon', 'feel', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'along', 'action', 'quite', 'exciting', 'grounded', 'reality', 'Outrunning', 'satellite', 'beam', 'car', 'can', 'turn', 'invisible', 'just', 'feels', 'too', 'silly', 'Bond', 'hanging', 'life', 'speeding', 'airport', 'vehicle', 'set', 'blow', 'up', 'more', 'exciting', 'Also', 'big', 'opening', 'set-piece', 'physics-defying', 'foot', 'chase', 'awesome', 'also', 'slightly', 'comical', 'keep', 'thinking', 'guy', 'should', ""'ve"", 'broken', 'bones', 'Departed', 'probably', 'skinniest', '2', 'Disc', 'special', 'edition', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'basically', 'got', '3', 'featurettes', 'look', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'announcement', 'start', 'new', 'Bond', 'surprisingly', 'entertaining', 'look', 'Bond', 'girls', 'Maryam', ""D'Abo"", 'being', 'main', 'host', 'look', 'stunts', 'being', 'more', 'real', 'rather', 'using', 'CG', 'can', 'obviously', 'tell', 'bigger', 'release', 'coming', 'just', 'be', 'lot', 'missing', 'commentary', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'nice', 'breakdown', 'action', 'scenes', 'something', 'anything', 'least', 'stuff', 'have', 'interesting', 'look', 'sudden', 'just', 'stops', 'feel', 'more', 'explore.Bet', 'lot', 'naysayers', 'sure', 'felt', 'sheepish', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'More', 'serious', 'brutal', 'just', 'around', 'better', 'great', 'see', 'Bond', 'agent', 'men', 'wanted', 'be', 'women', 'wanted', 'be', 'do']",N/A

I must say that I'm glad I didn't. As other reviewers have written, this movie is Bond the way he was meant to be seen (it's too bad that Brosnan was not the beneficiary of such a solid script because almost all of his movies were overly far-fetched and to a certain extent, campy). The story, based on the first Bond novel is perfect for Craig because he provides the physical force necessary to play the role.And what kind of Bond do we have? He doesn't have the suave and sophisticated carriage of the previous actors, but Craig does not need it since this is Bond when he just gains double O status. What this movie does is bring us back to the basics, especially in terms of the action sequences. Even if the movie were not a Bond film, it would be highly entertaining, the fact that it fits into this franchise makes it all the more rewarding.Without going into the actual plot, I would like to say that this movie is a success, one not to be missed.",4,One Solid Action Movie,1171324800,"02 13, 2007",2007,1181,"['have', 'admit', 'when', 'heard', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'was', 'going', 'replace', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'actor', 'who', 'done', 'fine', 'job', 'one', 'almost', 'as', 'good', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'was', 'incredibly', 'apprehensive', 'even', 'thought', 'boycotting', 'film', 'must', 'say', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'written', 'movie', 'Bond', 'way', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'seen', 'too', 'bad', 'Brosnan', 'was', 'not', 'beneficiary', 'such', 'solid', 'script', 'almost', 'movies', 'were', 'overly', 'far-fetched', 'certain', 'extent', 'campy', 'story', 'based', 'first', 'Bond', 'novel', 'perfect', 'Craig', 'physical', 'force', 'necessary', 'play', 'role.And', 'what', 'kind', 'Bond', 'do', 'have', ""n't"", 'have', 'suave', 'sophisticated', 'carriage', 'previous', 'actors', 'Craig', 'not', 'need', 'Bond', 'when', 'just', 'gains', 'double', 'O', 'status', 'What', 'movie', 'bring', 'back', 'basics', 'especially', 'terms', 'action', 'sequences', 'Even', 'movie', 'were', 'not', 'Bond', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'fact', 'franchise', 'more', 'rewarding.Without', 'going', 'actual', 'plot', 'would', 'like', 'say', 'movie', 'success', 'one', 'not', 'be', 'missed']",N/A

My friends know how I have felt, that this was the most serious entry in the Bond series ever. And the 84 reviews that preceed me is like the Bond line ""Your reputation preceeds you Mr. Bond"" (Moonraker). All in all, this was not only a Bond movie, it should have been considered for the Oscars more seriously. At least Best Direction, Best Set Design and yes, even Best Song. Oh well, maybe next time.But really, Daniel Craig captured what should have been captured long ago, but could not with the actors who preceeded him. Yes, Brosnan was cool, yes Moore was funny and yes Dalton tried to be serious, and even Connery tried to be Bond. Lazenby was perhaps even better than Connery in some ways. But if you know the Bond lore at all, Daniel Craig got it right, the producers got it right, Martin Campbell got it right. BOND IS BACK is more than a slogan for a poster, it is the truth of the series.Admittedly, this is the first Bond movie I ever shed a tear from, and that was at the end when Vesper slipped from Bond's fingers and was gone just inches from him. As much as she may have turned on the British Treasury by luring the money from Bond, it was a sad moment much like when Tracy was shot at the end of OHMSS. Bond truly loved both women and you can't help but feel his pain. He was lured into love and love was lost. It was real life on the big screen.The action...well, what can you say, top notch. The one thing I have seen absent in all of these reviews and online articles however, is any curiosity who the man in M's bed was when she was called in the middle of the night. Never since Judi Dench took over as M have we been aware of a husband or lover. And also, the woman at the table on LeChiffre's yacht during the private card game turns up at Casino Roayle and the table there. Who is she? Was she the mustache player's on the yacht wife or friend of LeChiffre? I am aching to find out.Simply the story was compelling and the length was actually just right. It gave room for the character development to come out. While 144 minutes may be too long for some people, I found it to be ideal to allow a Bond film to breathe, grow and tell a story. I would not have cut another minute.All in all, the producers and writers have much to accomplish in Bond 22. And I am confident they will. But we must wait for 20 months to find out. In the meantime, I will be wearing out the upcoming DVD between now and then realizing that in 49 years of life, I have grown dependent on Bond to give me an outlet from the pains of real life and take me to places I will never go.

1048149,A26BWRBPP4V2WF,B000MNP2K8,Craig MACKINNON,"[1, 2]","Just as ""Batman Begins"" was a restart for the Batman franchise, so is ""Casino Royale"" a reboot for James Bond.  Not only do we have a new Bond in Daniel Craig, but we go back to the first of Ian Fleming's spy novels, long inaccessible because of a copyright issue with the makers of a TV movie.  Like Batman Begins and other reboots of successful franchises, the film is all the more enjoyable: it is familiar yet different, not ""more of the same"" which tends to happen in upper sequels.Just as each actor has re-invented Bond to his own liking, so too does Craig bring a new twist.  Both his and Dalton's Bonds are more edgy and prone to violence (as opposed to the smoothness and womanising of the Moore and Brosnan incarnations).  The story: the young Bond is vying for ""double-O"" status (and therefore a license to kill).  He foolishly chases his terrorist quarry into an embassy and gets involved in an international incident.  This leads to my favourite line in the movie, uttered by Judy Dench's M: ""In the old days, when an agent did something that stupid he had the sense to defect.  Ch**** I miss the Cold War!""  One senses that the writers of the Bond films would echo that sentiment....Having failed to bring in that terrorist, Bond gets to work trying a different tack to track down the mysterious ""Le Chiffre"" - banker to the world's terrorists and banana-republic dictators.  Foolishly, Le Chiffre loses a huge sum of these people's money, and decides to host a high-stakes poker game in an attempt to win the money back.  Unfortunately, there is the usual silliness involved in the poker (in one hand the 4 players have a flush, two full houses, and a straight flush, the odds of which are astronomical, even in Texas Hold-em rules).But that is one of the few complaints that can be made of the film.  The scriptwriters (including the multi-Oscar nominated Paul Haggis) have a clear vision in mind and execute it well.  Most of the modern Bonds (going back to Moonraker) have been special effect and stunt extravaganzas where the plot often seems to be simply a thread holding together the action sequences.  This film makes the action serve the story.  As such, you're never quite sure what to expect - for example, once Bond finally gets into his Aston Martin for a car chase, it leads to a very unexpected result (if only in its duration).Granted, the end of the film drags out and introduces a confusing array of extra villians.  But countering that is Craig's performance (and Dench's, for that matter - some of the best moments are M trying to rein in Bond's impulsiveness and violence while trying not to blunt his effectiveness).  I don't know what the most vociferous of Craig's detractors think of his performance, but the final word goes to Rotten Tomatoes, which rated Casino Royale in its top 10 films of the year, based on the number of positive reviews it received.",4,James Bond Reboot,1175040000,"03 28, 2007",2007,2896,"['Just', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'was', 'restart', 'Batman', 'franchise', 'so', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'reboot', 'James', 'Bond', 'Not', 'only', 'do', 'have', 'new', 'Bond', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'go', 'back', 'first', 'Ian', 'Fleming', 'spy', 'novels', 'long', 'inaccessible', 'copyright', 'issue', 'makers', 'TV', 'movie', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'other', 'reboots', 'successful', 'franchises', 'film', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'familiar', 'yet', 'different', 'not', 'more', 'same', 'happen', 'upper', 'sequels.Just', 'actor', 're-invented', 'Bond', 'own', 'liking', 'so', 'too', 'Craig', 'bring', 'new', 'twist', 'Dalton', 'Bonds', 'are', 'more', 'edgy', 'prone', 'violence', 'opposed', 'smoothness', 'womanising', 'Moore', 'Brosnan', 'incarnations', 'story', 'young', 'Bond', 'vying', 'double-O', 'status', 'therefore', 'license', 'kill', 'terrorist', 'quarry', 'embassy', 'involved', 'international', 'incident', 'favourite', 'line', 'movie', 'uttered', 'Judy', 'Dench', 'M', 'old', 'days', 'when', 'agent', 'did', 'something', 'stupid', 'had', 'sense', 'defect', 'Ch****', 'miss', 'Cold', 'War', 'One', 'writers', 'Bond', 'films', 'would', 'echo', 'sentiment', '.Having', 'failed', 'bring', 'terrorist', 'Bond', 'work', 'trying', 'different', 'tack', 'track', 'down', 'mysterious', 'Le', 'Chiffre', 'banker', 'world', 'terrorists', 'banana-republic', 'dictators', 'Foolishly', 'Le', 'Chiffre', 'huge', 'sum', 'people', 'money', 'host', 'high-stakes', 'poker', 'game', 'attempt', 'win', 'money', 'back', 'Unfortunately', 'usual', 'silliness', 'involved', 'poker', 'one', 'hand', '4', 'players', 'have', 'flush', 'two', 'full', 'houses', 'straight', 'flush', 'odds', 'are', 'astronomical', 'even', 'Texas', 'Hold-em', 'rules', '.But', 'one', 'few', 'complaints', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'film', 'scriptwriters', 'including', 'multi-Oscar', 'nominated', 'Paul', 'Haggis', 'have', 'clear', 'vision', 'mind', 'execute', 'well', 'Most', 'modern', 'Bonds', 'going', 'back', 'Moonraker', 'have', 'been', 'special', 'effect', 'stunt', 'extravaganzas', 'where', 'plot', 'often', 'be', 'simply', 'thread', 'holding', 'together', 'action', 'sequences', 'film', 'action', 'serve', 'story', 'such', ""'re"", 'never', 'quite', 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'example', 'once', 'Bond', 'finally', 'Aston', 'Martin', 'car', 'chase', 'very', 'unexpected', 'result', 'only', 'duration', '.Granted', 'end', 'film', 'out', 'confusing', 'array', 'extra', 'villians', 'countering', 'Craig', 'performance', 'Dench', 'matter', 'best', 'moments', 'are', 'M', 'trying', 'rein', 'Bond', 'impulsiveness', 'violence', 'trying', 'not', 'blunt', 'effectiveness', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'most', 'vociferous', 'Craig', 'detractors', 'think', 'performance', 'final', 'word', 'Rotten', 'Tomatoes', 'rated', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'top', '10', 'films', 'year', 'based', 'number', 'positive', 'reviews', 'received']",N/A

However, I heard from some who saw it that it was quite good.  So, I gave it a look.  It is terrific.  Now, if you want Sean Connery, or Roger Moore, or Pierce Brosnan or any other Bond, you will certainly be frustrated.  This is an entirely fresh take on Bond and I enjoyed it a great deal.This is Bond at the beginning of his 007 career.  He is laconic rather than full of quips.  While he can be charming and even dress elegantly, we never forget he is a killer.  Bond hasn't developed his signature martini yet and is actually conflicted about what all the violence is doing to whomever it is he is underneath.Unlike most of the Bond films, there isn't a single super-villain here.  Instead there are several bad guys and we are not quite sure what is actually going on until near the end and even then there is still something more than we realize.  The technology, conflicts, and fashions of the film is present day rather than 1950s - 60s Cold War.The fighting and action of the film is also very up to date.  While not horribly graphic, it does seem more real and in some ways beyond reality.  I am thinking of the chase scene on foot early in the film.  Who can move like that?  But it does come off as thrilling.The Bond Girls are beautiful, but are not mere decorations.  They have things they do in the plot.  Certainly, some are more capable than others.  But the emotional depth of what they go through is deeper than in any other Bond film that I can recall.Is Daniel Craig a good Bond?  Of course, you have to decide for yourself.  My wife deos wish that his face were more elegant, but I like him.  He has the kind of anger and animal energy one would expect in a killer who lasts against steep odds.  I look forward to his next film as Bond.If you like Bond, I say give this film a chance and enjoy it for what it is rather than wishing it were something it never intended to be.There is a second disk with some good features about this film and its context in the Bond tradition that are pretty good.",5,"Much better than I expected, but certainly a fresh take on Bond",1174089600,"03 17, 2007",2007,2117,"['negative', 'pre-publicity', 'movie', 'received', 'was', 'not', 'much', 'interested', 'seeing', 'However', 'heard', 'who', 'saw', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'So', 'gave', 'look', 'terrific', 'Now', 'want', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'Roger', 'Moore', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'other', 'Bond', 'will', 'certainly', 'be', 'frustrated', 'entirely', 'fresh', 'take', 'Bond', 'enjoyed', 'great', 'deal.This', 'Bond', 'beginning', '007', 'career', 'laconic', 'rather', 'full', 'quips', 'can', 'be', 'charming', 'even', 'dress', 'elegantly', 'never', 'forget', 'killer', 'Bond', ""n't"", 'developed', 'signature', 'martini', 'yet', 'actually', 'conflicted', 'what', 'violence', 'doing', 'whomever', 'underneath.Unlike', 'most', 'Bond', 'films', ""n't"", 'single', 'super-villain', 'here', 'Instead', 'are', 'several', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'what', 'actually', 'going', 'end', 'even', 'then', 'still', 'something', 'more', 'realize', 'technology', 'conflicts', 'fashions', 'film', 'present', 'day', 'rather', '1950s', '60s', 'Cold', 'War.The', 'fighting', 'action', 'film', 'also', 'very', 'up', 'date', 'not', 'horribly', 'graphic', 'seem', 'more', 'real', 'ways', 'reality', 'am', 'thinking', 'chase', 'scene', 'foot', 'early', 'film', 'Who', 'can', 'move', 'come', 'off', 'thrilling.The', 'Bond', 'Girls', 'are', 'beautiful', 'are', 'not', 'mere', 'decorations', 'have', 'things', 'do', 'plot', 'Certainly', 'are', 'more', 'capable', 'others', 'emotional', 'depth', 'what', 'go', 'deeper', 'other', 'Bond', 'film', 'can', 'recall.Is', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'good', 'Bond', 'course', 'have', 'decide', 'wife', 'wish', 'face', 'were', 'more', 'elegant', 'like', 'kind', 'anger', 'animal', 'energy', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'killer', 'who', 'steep', 'odds', 'look', 'forward', 'next', 'film', 'Bond.If', 'Bond', 'say', 'give', 'film', 'chance', 'enjoy', 'what', 'rather', 'wishing', 'were', 'something', 'never', 'intended', 'be.There', 'second', 'disk', 'good', 'features', 'film', 'context', 'Bond', 'tradition', 'are', 'pretty', 'good']",N/A

As well as giving the performance of his career in the process. Daniel Craig gives a galvanizing performance as the freshly minted double-0 agent. Suave, reckless, and possessed with an ego that compromises his judgment during his first mission to root out the mastermind behind an operation that funds international terrorists. There is also one of the best villains in recent years with Mads Mikkelsen as the cold blooded Le Chiffre. He heads an international cartel not so much bent on world destruction as on taking advantage of the chaos in which we live.For longtime fans of the franchise, Casino Royale offers some retro kicks. Bond wins his iconic Astin-Martin at the gaming table, and when a bartender asks if he wants his martini ""shaken or stirred,"" he disdainfully replies, ""Do I look like I give a damn?"" There's no Moneypenny or ""Q,"" but Dame Judi Dench is back as the exasperated M, who one senses, admires Bond's ""bloody cheek."" It is also refreshing to see Bond have a real love interest in Eva Green, not the usual banter that rings hollow. Bond is not afraid to expose himself in this movie, revealing a much more vulnerable figure than we have seen before.From its punishing violence and virtuoso action sequences to its romance, Casino Royale is a Bond film that, in the words of one character, makes you feel it, particularly during an excruciating torture sequence. Double-0s, Bond observes early on, ""have a short life expectancy.""

James Bond enters the game in order to destroy Le Chiffre for good. Bond teams up with Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) who is assigned to keep an eye on him and how he handles the large amount of government money needed to enter the tournament. But as Bond gets more involved in the game, he becomes tangled in a web of lies, deceit, and betrayal.Casino Royale is partially based on Ian Fleming's first James Bond novel. About the first third of the film is added to provide a background for Le Chiffre, but the poker game stays very close to the book. Although the film may not sound as action-packed as some of the others, trust me, the action is intense! This film has a deeper storyline than most Bond movies. Daniel Craig plays a colder James Bond that has a chip on his shoulder. The film definitely takes a darker and more serious tone to match. Casino Royale also lacks the humor of other Bond films (don't expect Sean Connery style one-liners or Roger Moore slapstick here). The film has a noticeable absence of gadgets, which I thought were becoming over-the-top after Die Another Day.This stylistic re-boot to the Bond franchise is very well done!

About all I know is that it's usually good to hold aces and always good to have a huge pile of chips in front of you.  Yet, I certainly enjoyed Casino Royale which features a giant-stakes game.Daniel Craig plays a more ""human"" James Bond than those I have seen before. Craig seems more fallible and, therefore, more believable than the other Bonds. As other reviewers have pointed out, Craig is also more of a ""working class"" Bond. For example, he says he doesn't give a damn whether his martini is shaken or stirred, thus mocking a trademark line of the former more sophisticated and plastic James Bonds. This is not to imply that Craig portrays a soft Bond. His Bond is a master marksman, street fighter extraordinaire, and brutal assassin.There's plenty of excitement. Fantastic stunts. The foot chase through the skyscraper construction site is spectacular. The poisoning of Bond is one of the most dramatic sequences ever.Other Bonds are noted for their seduction of beautiful women. But this Bond convinces us that he's really smitten with the vivacious Vesper Lynd, who was so very effectively portrayed by Eva Green.  There's a touching love story here.There are elements found in all the 007 films. M is here, but now M is a woman, deftly portrayed by Judi Dench. There's the heartless villain, Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen), the man who cries blood. There are vintage and high performance cars. Like earlier Bonds, this one uses advanced technology.

The team behind Casino Royale obviously decided to move in a new direction, abandoning key elements of the formula: debonair Bonds, drop dead gorgeous vixens, and incomparable special effects.  Let's start with Daniel Craig.  He just doesn't have it.  He looks too old (this story is supposed to occur early in Bond's career).  His stockiness kills any hope for a fashion sense.  Still, a great actor can overcome these shortcomings to look like a hero (like Tobey Maquire did with Spiderman).  Not Craig.  This man cannot act.  He has a total of two looks in the movie:  a poker face and a constipated canary face.  The later he uses to woo women and to stare down villains.  Apparently, that looked took a lot of work since even it disappeared in the second half of the movie leaving us with a blank poker face.I guess to keep with a somewhat ugly Bond (whose most notable feature are his satellite dish ears), the producers decided to cast more down to earth females.  I never imagined seeing ladies like this in a Bond movie.  I thought I was watching The Facts of Life.  As for the special effects...they started off good, but just faded into ordinary low budget action thriller effects.In short, it was disappointing.

With all the pre-release criticism and speculation put to rest, Daniel Craig proves that blondes do have more fun, much more fun, for his James Bond is the most real, the most intense and the most enjoyable of the lot of them.With a plot that makes sense and is easy to follow, `Casino Royale' delivers on every level that a film can, providing entertainment for everyone. My wife, who is not a fan of Bond movies or even action movies utterly loved this film, so much so that she insisted we see it again the following night. With action sequences that look so painstakingly real, to emotions that look so painstakingly real, Daniel Craig and the rest of the cast hit every note just right.Starting us off with Bond earning his `00' status, the film gives us a great development of the man. `Casino Royale' is what Bale and Nolan did for Batman with last years `Batman Begins' for Craig and Campbell breathed life into a dying genre. Sure, everyone who loves Bond will love Bond, but even his fans will admit that the latest in the long line of Bond films was growing tired, but now, with `Casino Royale' under his belt, Bond has a new reason to breathe.I want to also make mention of Eva Green, an actress I feel is only a few short roles away from an Oscar, for her turn as Bond girl Vesper Lynd was brilliant. For the first time in the history of Bond films has a Bond girl been more than a piece of tail. Vesper is smart, seductive and essential to the development, of not just the story but of James Bond himself, for her character and performance add so much weight to his growth as a man.`Casino Royale' will go down as the greatest Bond film in history (that is until Craig and Campbell top it) and will be a reminder to all that just because Bond looks different doesn't mean it's a bad thing, for Daniel Craig has done things with this franchise that us Bond fans have only dreamed of.

The guy had so many stunt doubles you have to wonder how he justified his paycheck. Pierce Brosnan? OK, but as an actor, he doesn't have much range. (And, like Moore, he provided plenty of work for stunt doubles.)""Casino Royale"" completely blew me away. Not only was it a great, fresh, vital, exciting Bond picture, I thought it was one of the best of 2006. It's just a cool movie! And Daniel Craig? HERE is James Bond unleashed. Craig does excellent work. Not only did he do many of his own stunts, in some of the most thrilling and well-filmed action sequences in many a year, he also made Bond an intriguing, scary, likable character. Who knew there could be so many facets to 007? Judging from Roger Moore's work, it was definitely hard to tell.Craig carries this sleek, often brutal, exceptionally well-produced movie on his capable shoulders. He's got great charisma (think Harrison Ford crossed with Steve McQueen), a wit as dry as one of Sean Connery's martinis, and looks just as comfortable with blood on his face as in a tuxedo. Even if the film itself had been average, or even sub-par, Craig's swaggering, low-key presence makes it something special.Thankfully, the movie is anything but sub-par. Martin Campbell handles action scenes and poker table intrigue with equal brilliance. The writing impressed me the most.

The scenes in the film offer a gritter plot than the usual thrill ride which definitely keeps the viewers' interest. Plot points are short but necessary, not overdone at all and keep pace with the demands of today's audiences. The audiences of today require something a little more realistic and tough.

1048167,A239PPUVV8O0U0,B000MNP2K8,D. A. Reed,"[1, 1]","Batman Begins was the movie that started the whole franchise reboot craze. Like The Pink Panther, James Bond was soon to follow. Daniel Craig is good but in my opinion he lacks the suave sophistication that Connery, Moore and Brosnan had. He's a fine actor though, able to handle the action (especially Le Chiffre's torture), dramatic and romance scenes. Eva Green was a brilliant choice as Vesper. Unlike previous Bond girls where they had to be a government agent or nuclear physicist in order to be an equal with Bond, Vesper is able to make jabs at Bond and hold her own against his sexist ways but her character is not action oriented and emotionally vulnerable, which makes her more feminine than some of her predecessors. The shower and final scenes are the best examples I can give on how, other than Tracy from OHMSS, Vesper is the only woman Bond has ever fallen in love with. Le Chiffre, while not one of the more memorable villains in the Bond canon, is big step up from the bratty Gustav Graves. He is cold, calculating and not afraid to cut Bond down to size if he doesn't tell him what he wants to know. Judi Dench, the only connection to the previous films, returns as M, who is shown more in this film but some of her scenes just seem unnecesary to the storyline. The plot is good, though the only parts that are adapted from the original novel are the casino and torture scenes. I do hate that they made it seem that Le Chiffre had a hand in 9/11. In this and the following Bond film, I hate how they're striving too hard for realism, in the past, the politcal points of the films were always subtle (the Cold War, detante and the fall of Communnism) and sometimes actually relevant to the story. The reference to 9/11, to me anyways, just seemed pointless as it adds nothing to Le Chiffre's character or the plot. There are too many action sequences in this film, which hurts it a little bit. They make Bond seem like Superman, jumping around on top of construction sites and bursting through walls (I could hear the George Reeves Superman theme in my head when he did that). And the way Bond heals from all of his wounds is so astounding, he'd put Wolverine to shame. David Arnold provides probably his best Bond score, though his music, especially for the action sequences, are loud and obnoxious. And I know that this is Bond's first mission, but that doesn't mean he should just barely use the Bond Theme. I think it was Arnold himself on a special feature on the Bond music who said ""Don't be afraid to use the Bond Theme. If it's not in the film, its just a regular action film.""

1048170,A37OOQQLMMKYR8,B000MNP2K8,Dave. K,"[1, 1]","CASINO ROYALE**** Out of 5Release Date- November 17th, 2006Running Time- 144-MinutesRating- PG-13Screenplay- Neal Purvis, Robert Wade & Paul HaggisDirector- Martin CampbellStarring- Daniel Craig, Eva Green, Mads Mikkelsen, Giancarlo Giannini, Jeffrey Wright, Jesper Christensen and Judi Dench as MI'll be the first to admit I'm not the biggest fan of the Bond series, while I do enjoy the movies when a new Bond movie is released I'm not in a rush to go see it. I'll watch it whenever I get around to it. So my opinion on Casino Royale may not hold as much weight as the hardcore fans, but I'll give it a go.After the Die Another Day, which was the 20th Bond movie Pierce Brosnan was out as James Bond and Daniel Craig was in. While Daniel Craig has been around for a while he wasn't very well known. A lot of fans were upset that Brosnan was out. When it comes to the best James Bond that title is between Sean Connery, Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan and it seems many lean towards Brosnan; Daniel Craig was getting some heat when he was announced, but after the release of Casino Royale many were now hailing Daniel Craig as the best James Bond. I think it's still too early to declare Craig has the best Bond, but he's on his way to earning that title; I'll get back to that later.The one amazing thing about this franchise is how it went from decade to decade starting in the 60s and is still going strong today. How many franchises can go on that long and change with the times? It's quite rare, but I'll give the filmmakers of the series credit for keeping the Bond flicks going strong.I'm not sure which of the series would be my favorite, but Casino Royale is a frontrunner, but the movie isn't without it's flaws. Casino Royale starts off quite explosive and while it stays strong through out I do think it could have been slightly better. The biggest problem I had was the 144-minute running time. While I wouldn't say Casino Royale ever dragged at all and each scene does move the movie forward I do think it could have used a bit of editing. I personally don't think the movie needed to be as long as it was, but with that said despite the running time Casino Royale never drags.The screenplay by Neal Purvis, Robert Wade & Paul Haggis is well written and the characters are solid, but I have to say I wasn't too into the villains. In my opinion they were sort of forgettable. The Bond series has almost always had great villains, but this time around I never really cared too much about them. Besides that the script is quite strong with some excellent dialogue and excellent set ups. The Bond movies are often over the top, but not in a bad way, but the script here seemed a bit more real in my opinion.Director Martin Campbell previously directed the Bond movie GoldenEye, which happened to be the first time Brosnan played the role and here he is returning to the series and directing the part, which happens to be Daniel Craig's debut in the series. Casino Royale in my opinion might feature the best and most exciting action sequences of the series. The action is quite well done and strays from the typical Hollywood action movie put out these days and due to that they work even better. With 144-minutes it can be tough to keep the pace going and Martin Campbell is able to sustain a strong pacing and always keeps the movie interesting. I'm not really into poker and those scenes are the only time I started to lose a little bit of interest, but Campbell is able to keep the tension high and was able to keep my interest just when I would start to lose it.The Bond Girl is one of the most important things about any Bond movie outside of whose playing James Bond, the Bon Girl is the next big thing. Eva Green is the latest and while I did like the character she wasn't the best of the Bond Girls, but easily one of the sexiest of them all. Eva Green was good in her role, but I don't think she would be one of the elite, but she does work amazingly well with Daniel Craig and that in part helped elevate her a bit.I'm not sure who would take my top spot for James Bond, but Daniel Craig just might take that spot. His Bond was a little darker and a little more bad a** (almost reminds of Jack Bauer a little bit). From an acting stand point, Daniel Craig delivers a solid performance, but I don't think he's the best actor to play the role in line delivery, don't get take that wrong. I think Daniel Craig is an excellent actor, but I don't think he was the best in terms of delivering his lines, but from a psychical stand point I think he was by far the best.Daniel Craig also does really well with emotion without any lines. I don't wanna spoil anything, but a certain scene with Craig and Green towards the end is one of the best moments of the series and without any lines Daniel Craig was quite powerful. I still think it's too early to say Daniel Craig is the best, but he's well on his way. I haven't seen Quantum of Solace yet, so maybe that will put him over the top for me.Overall Casino Royale was an excellent entry in the series and Daniel Craig proved all the naysayers wrong and delivers a top notch performance. Fans of the series should enjoy and casual fans like me could also enjoy this. While Casino Royale stays true to the series it also takes a slightly different direction and possibly even non-fans might like this one.",4,Excellent,1232841600,"01 25, 2009",2009,5367,"['CASINO',

I own every other Bond film with the exception of this one(and boy, am I glad I rented it and didn't buy it).  Folks are noting that this is a realistic Bond -- where?  Was it during the Spiderman sequence as two man are scaling a construction site?  Oh, and the chase through a construction site (popping in and out of shafts and construction holes) apparently so perfectly choreographed that it may as well be ""A Chorus Line.""  No one runs at top speed through a major construction site unscathed or unblocked shooting and skipping through unknown crevices, without slamming into some dangerous obstacle on the other side -- ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS!!!  I would rather suspend belief and embrace an Alligator Submarine, an invisible car, a human jet-pack, or a mini-jet that exits from a Horse Carrier.  And, the gas tanker sequence, it may as well have been a Hook and Ladder chase through the streets of San Francisco (oh, that's right, that chase actually had me riveted!).  How convenient that Bond realized that the tanker windshield had been fully taken out, while his action sequence was in the back of the tanker -- in real life he would not have know that if he propelled himself from the top of the cab that he would land squarely next to the driver instead of banging off the front of the cab, unto the ground, and under the tires.  Bye bye Daniel Craig!  The film was about an hour too long.  Gimme Jaws and the good old days anytime because if this is the new Bond, it's time to find a new film icon.

Colley ""daz78""","[4, 8]","Casino Royale was the kick up the backside that the Bond series needed if it wished to carry on forward and compete with the younger pretenders such as the Bourne series or even the Jack Ryan series. With the absurd invisible car in Die Another Day, things were getting too cartoonish and despite good box-office receipts it will only be a matter of time before fans had enough.In steps Daniel Craig, a new Bond taking on a familiar story, Fleming's first foray of James Bond, Casino Royale. Craig's chance at Bond was met with mixed feelings, some even setting up websites in protest. This, before even filming took place, was unfair and misguided. However, it worked in the film's favour anyway as the publicity helped the film shoot through the box-office roof and without much help of PR and advertising either.Craig is a tougher Bond, steely like Connery and without the comedy routine that Roger Moore brought to the role. He is a brilliant Bond, a man who is at war with his own morality as well as his enemies, a theme that hasn't really explored in previous Bond films.Eva Green is sexy AND intelligent as Vesper Lynd, and it is by no means just another bit of crumpet for Bond. It is through her fate that Bond becomes the cold-hearted ruthless killing machine that we have come to know.Mads Mikkelsen plays the chilling - though not the main villain as we find out near the end - Le Chiffre. Unlike other Bond villains he has no clear quirks (ala Dr. evil) but he does weep tears of blood when in stressful situations.In fact on the whole CASINO ROYALE loses most of the gimmicks and familiar base-situated-in-a-volcano that has grown over the years in Bond movies(to the absurd point in Moonraker). The gadgets are near non-existent, CGI is minimal, and so the stunts are amazing as always (especially the crane jump near the beginning). Even the famous, iconic Bond tune is only heard at the end.The only critism that can befall CASINO ROYALE is the avoidance of today's terrorist climate. The film does involve terrorism but avoids it front on (the bad guys here are arms dealers). This still seems like a world where 9/11 hasn't happened, and that MI6 are still trudging after arms dealers and misfits rather than terror groups.

Perhaps because this film is set at the beginning of Bond's career, he is neither as suave nor as at ease as the other Bonds, although he is every bit as likable.The storyline is straightforward, at least in overview:  in tracking down a bombmaker, Bond uncovers a broader terrorist presence that leads to a French financier, Le Chiffre, who literally weeps blood and who promises off-shore safe haven for terrorist funds.  What the terrorists don't know is that Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen) is using their funds for his own enrichment  When Bond thwarts Le Chiffre's plan, all bets are off except at the casino, where Le Chiffre attempts to win back the sum before the terrorists get to him.  As usual, Bond has no intention of letting Le Chiffre succeed.  And also as usual, there is a Bond girl, Vesper Lynd (Eva Green).All the actors, including Judi Dench as the authoritative M, fit their roles admirably.  But since most people watch the Bond movies for the blow-'em-up, adrendaline-saturated scenes, the real question is whether it is an exciting movie.  The answer is yes, except for the flabbiness mentioned in the first paragraph.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann",4,I love Craig's gritty Bond (4+ stars),1271980800,"04 23, 2010",2010,1472,"['doubt', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'five-star', 'action', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'lose', 'focus', 'briefly', 'beginning', 'final', 'act', 'one', 'finer', 'Bond', 'films', 'Craig', 'Bond', 'grittier', 'predecessors', 'unresolved', 'issues', 'make', 'dangerous', 'even', 'Perhaps', 'film', 'set', 'beginning', 'Bond', 'career', 'suave', 'ease', 'other', 'Bonds', 'bit', 'likable.The', 'storyline', 'straightforward', 'least', 'overview', 'tracking', 'down', 'bombmaker', 'Bond', 'broader', 'terrorist', 'presence', 'French', 'financier', 'Le', 'Chiffre', 'who', 'literally', 'weeps', 'blood', 'who', 'off-shore', 'safe', 'haven', 'terrorist', 'funds', 'What', 'terrorists', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Le', 'Chiffre', 'Mads', 'Mikkelsen', 'using', 'funds', 'own', 'enrichment', 'When', 'Bond', 'Le', 'Chiffre', 'plan', 'bets', 'are', 'casino', 'where', 'Le', 'Chiffre', 'win', 'back', 'sum', 'terrorists', 'get', 'usual', 'Bond', 'intention', 'letting', 'Le', 'Chiffre', 'succeed', 'also', 'as', 'usual', 'Bond', 'girl', 'Vesper', 'Lynd', 'Eva', 'Green', '.All', 'actors', 'including', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'authoritative', 'M', 'fit', 'roles', 'admirably', 'most', 'people', 'watch', 'Bond', 'movies', ""blow-'em-up"", 'adrendaline-saturated', 'scenes', 'real', 'question', 'exciting', 'movie', 'answer', 'yes', 'flabbiness', 'mentioned', 'first', 'paragraph.', 'Debbie', 'Lee', 'Wesselmann']",N/A

Like a streamlined new millennium version of Steve McQueen he brings a harsh grittiness to the role that to me fits the original written works. There are enough reviews on here that hash and rehash the contents of the film but I think this kind of thing generally boils down to personal preference.So, why did *I* like this film? Well, as far as what to expect from Bond, right from the opening scene you *definitely* get the idea that ""Dorothy, you're NOT in Kansas anymore""!!! Without ""spoiling it"" I can tell you that Craig as Bond is serious as a heart attack from minute one and has no time to waste with the sometimes silly one liners that have peppered Bond movies of the past. He shows a range and depth of raw yet reigned in emotion unlike ANY of his Bond predecessors. He also gives new meaning to ""edgy"" - in a particularly wince-worthy scene you begin to question if he is uncompromisingly hard as nails or more than just a bit crazy.The action sequences are some of the best I have ever seen; better than those of the Bourne series if you're looking for something to compare it to.Since the story/script had the daunting task of being true to THIS film yet still had to tie the ones to follow together, I think it did a great job of connecting the dots.This DVD set includes a second disk which has the ""making of"" Casino Royale.The best I can do is say that whether or not you are a fan of the Bond legacy, this is definitely a film worth watching.",5,"bond fan or not, this is a fantastic movie",1323648000,"12 12, 2011",2011,1536,"['humble', 'opinion', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'perfect', 'new-incarnation', 'Bond', 'streamlined', 'new', 'millennium', 'version', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'harsh', 'grittiness', 'role', 'original', 'written', 'are', 'enough', 'reviews', 'here', 'hash', 'rehash', 'contents', 'film', 'think', 'kind', 'thing', 'generally', 'down', 'personal', 'preference.So', 'why', 'did', '*I*', 'film', 'Well', 'as', 'far', 'what', 'expect', 'Bond', 'right', 'opening', 'scene', '*definitely*', 'get', 'idea', 'Dorothy', ""'re"", 'NOT', 'Kansas', 'anymore', 'spoiling', 'can', 'tell', 'Craig', 'Bond', 'serious', 'heart', 'attack', 'minute', 'one', 'time', 'waste', 'sometimes', 'silly', 'one', 'liners', 'have', 'peppered', 'Bond', 'movies', 'past', 'range', 'depth', 'raw', 'yet', 'reigned', 'emotion', 'ANY', 'Bond', 'predecessors', 'also', 'new', 'meaning', 'edgy', 'particularly', 'wince-worthy', 'scene', 'begin', 'question', 'uncompromisingly', 'hard', 'nails', 'more', 'just', 'bit', 'crazy.The', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'best', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'better', 'Bourne', 'series', ""'re"", 'looking', 'something', 'compare', 'to.Since', 'story/script', 'had', 'daunting', 'task', 'being', 'true', 'THIS', 'film', 'yet', 'still', 'had', 'tie', 'ones', 'follow', 'together', 'think', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'connecting', 'dots.This', 'DVD', 'set', 'second', 'disk', 'making', 'Casino', 'Royale.The', 'best', 'can', 'do', 'say', 'not', 'are', 'fan', 'Bond', 'legacy', 'definitely', 'film', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A

Stokes,"[0, 1]","There was a huge amount of controversy in fandom surrounding Daniel Craig as the new James Bond, most of it negative, and mostly centered around his appearance. I've mentioned before that I'm really not a visually-oriented person, so maybe that's why such objections never made any sense to me. It's vastly more important to me that the actor is convincing in the role, and Daniel Craig fit this role in this film very well.Of course, Casino Royale is a different sort of Bond film from the most recent ones, and substituting Daniel Craig's James Bond for Pierce Brosnan's really wouldn't have worked. Nor would Pierce Brosnan's James Bond have worked in Casino Royale.As for those who complain that Casino Royale is mucking around with the tradition--yes, this is vastly different from Die Another Day. But this is not the first time the franchise has shifted direction. It's happened pretty much every time there's a new Bond, though it seems to have been a more gradual shift from Moore to Dalton to Brosnan. What makes it more acceptable is that Casino Royale takes place at the very beginning of the Bond mythos, so even if one doesn't view the movies as disparate entities, it's believable that when he first became 007, he was rougher around the edges than he was later.Casino Royale shows the very beginning of James Bond--how he becomes 007. The start of the film was a dizzying blur, partially in black and white, depicting his earning that 00 status (two kills required--the first one's the hardest). It was brutal and stark, and only the distance created by the film techniques kept it from being too graphic.There's a requisite busy action scene, with a chase scene that was so long and involved such Jackie-Chan-worthy stunts that I started laughing, earning a glare from my older son. Whoops. No, I wasn't loud. I'm not one of those people.But then we get to the meat of the movie, with Bond against Le Chiffre, a terrorist financier who's also an inveterate gambler. Bond's mission is to join the high-stakes game and win--or rather, keep Le Chiffre from winning, bankrupting him, and forcing him to accept the government's offer. Enter Vesper Lynd, the treasury agent who comes along to ensure that Bond isn't wasting the government's money.You can tell it's been a long time since I read the books, because I kept hearing her name as ""Vespa"", which made some of the jokes a little nonsensical.It's not a spoiler to say that Bond falls in love with her and she eventually betrays him--after all, James Bond cannot have a HEA romantic ending, particularly not at this juncture, because we know from earlier films that he's single. Don't try to sort out the timelines--it'll give you a headache, particularly if you try to reconcile Judi Dench's M with Goldeneye.All in all, an exciting film. A change in direction for the franchise, to be sure, but one that was necessary, I think, to re-energize the series.

1048208,A38UHOCEKSUOSP,B000MNP2K8,"dominion_ruler ""Bryan""","[0, 1]","Toughness and physicality stand out more than anything in the 22nd James Bond movie, thanks to the new Bond character played by Daniel Craig.  His physical appearance is tougher than any previous Bond, and that adds to the terrific and exciting action in Casino Royale.  His on screen presence, action or not, is always solid and he has a way of easily drawing in the interest of the audience.  His acting is just great, and I don't think you could find another Bond replacement anywhere else.  I have no doubt that the Bond franchise will continue because of this man, and Casino Royale has become one of the most popular of all the Bond movies ever made.While Daniel Craig is the strongest element that made this movie work, Casino Royale is actually a wonderful film in its own.  The story and plot are very well told and very interesting, told in the Bond tradition with the refreshness of a modern film rolled in.  The action is simply amazing.  Only 2 big action scenes but they are intense and again, more physical than any previous Bond film.  I don't mean fights, but more like stunts and quickness you would see in a Jackie Chan movie.  The other characters are wonderful too, especially the villain, Le Cheffre.  The man is not a physical challenge for Bond, but an intelligent one.  He carries a nasty scar over his fake left eye that speaks villain for itself.  The Bond girl in this movie is different than one would expect from previous Bond movies.  There is actually an emotional attachment between her and Bond, and we get to see what becomes of Bond's trust towards women after Casino Royale.The run time felt a bit long, nearly 2-1/2 hours.  The intensity slows way down at the end, but picks up with an ending I admit I did not see coming, and very important story for the future of Bond.  I loved the beginning of the film, which creates a unique beginning for the famous ""Bond walk, stop, aim and shoot - seen through the eye of the enemy's gun"" you see before every Bond movie.  The title credits and theme song ""You Know My Name"" were unique yet fit very well.  Bond locations have come back in Casino Royale, where as in some of the latter Brosnan movies, exotic locations were become nothing more than the inside of a studio.  Casino Royale takes place in Madagascar, Bahamas, Miami, and Montenegro.Bond fan or not, you will love this film.  It is everything a good classic Bond film has and what a film for today needs.  Yes, Bond seems to be coming back to its roots in this one.  Casino Royale is arguably one of the best Bond movies made and Daniel Craig might just give the original Sean Connery some competition.Acting - 4.5Action - 4.5Charcaters - 4.5Story - 4.5Overall - 4.5",5,[4.5] The toughest Bond yet,1181865600,"06 15, 2007",2007,2709,"['Toughness', 'physicality', 'stand', 'out', 'more', 'anything', '22nd', 'James', 'Bond', 'movie', 'thanks', 'new', 'Bond', 'character', 'played', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'physical', 'appearance', 'tougher', 'previous', 'Bond', 'terrific', 'exciting', 'action', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'screen', 'presence', 'action', 'not', 'always', 'solid', 'way', 'easily', 'drawing', 'interest', 'audience', 'acting', 'just', 'great', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'could', 'find', 'Bond', 'replacement', 'anywhere', 'else', 'have', 'doubt', 'Bond', 'franchise', 'will', 'continue', 'man', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'become', 'one', 'most', 'popular', 'Bond', 'movies', 'ever', 'made.While', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'strongest', 'element', 'made', 'movie', 'work', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'actually', 'wonderful', 'film', 'own', 'story', 'plot', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'told', 'very', 'interesting', 'told', 'Bond', 'tradition', 'refreshness', 'modern', 'film', 'rolled', 'action', 'simply', 'amazing', 'Only', '2', 'big', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'intense', 'again', 'more', 'physical', 'previous', 'Bond', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'fights', 'more', 'stunts', 'quickness', 'would', 'see', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'movie', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'wonderful', 'too', 'especially', 'villain', 'Le', 'Cheffre', 'man', 'not', 'physical', 'challenge', 'Bond', 'intelligent', 'one', 'nasty', 'scar', 'fake', 'left', 'eye', 'villain', 'Bond', 'girl', 'movie', 'different', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'previous', 'Bond', 'movies', 'actually', 'emotional', 'attachment', 'Bond', 'get', 'see', 'what', 'Bond', 'trust', 'towards', 'women', 'Casino', 'Royale.The', 'run', 'time', 'felt', 'bit', 'long', 'nearly', '2-1/2', 'hours', 'intensity', 'way', 'down', 'end', 'up', 'ending', 'admit', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'coming', 'very', 'important', 'story', 'future', 'Bond', 'loved', 'beginning', 'film', 'unique', 'beginning', 'famous', 'Bond', 'walk', 'stop', 'aim', 'shoot', 'seen', 'eye', 'enemy', 'gun', 'see', 'Bond', 'movie', 'title', 'credits', 'theme', 'song', 'Know', 'Name', 'were', 'unique', 'yet', 'fit', 'very', 'well', 'Bond', 'locations', 'have', 'come', 'back', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'where', 'latter', 'Brosnan', 'movies', 'exotic', 'locations', 'were', 'become', 'nothing', 'more', 'inside', 'studio', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'place', 'Madagascar', 'Bahamas', 'Miami', 'Montenegro.Bond', 'fan', 'not', 'will', 'love', 'film', 'everything', 'good', 'classic', 'Bond', 'film', 'what', 'film', 'today', 'needs', 'Yes', 'Bond', 'be', 'coming', 'back', 'roots', 'one', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'arguably', 'one', 'best', 'Bond', 'movies', 'made', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'might', 'just', 'give', 'original', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'competition.Acting', '4.5Action', '4.5Charcaters', '4.5Story', '4.5Overall', '4.5']",N/A

Thus for Daniel Craig's debut as Agent 007 in 2006's ""Casino Royale.""  Not only is this a new Bond, it is a reboot of the series, taking Bond back to his roots as an agent licensed to kill.The movie opens with a stunningly gritty retrospective showing Bond earning his 007 rating with two very ugly, messy kills.  This Bond is a relentless thug with only the thinnest veneer of the wit and charm associated with the role.  Licensed to kill, Bond is off in pursuit of a mysterious financier of terrorists named Le Chiffre.  The long chase ends at a casino in Montengro and a high stakes poker game.  Le Chiffre has speculated with other people's money; Bond, backed by M's (Judi Dench) money and by a treasury agent named Vesper Lynd, intends to bankrupt his opponent at the table.  The poker game turns into a fight to the death, at the table and outside the casino.  Bond's job will be complicated by betrayal and by his feelings for his partner.  A messy conclusion will lead directly to the next movie.Daniel Craig takes some getting used as Bond, but he ultimately owns the role (and has improved through two sequels).

1048231,ARNEUO7BF3J55,B000MNP2K8,E. David Swan,"[4, 8]","There have been several reboots of the James Bond series but this one is by far the most dramatic and succesful. In `License to Kill' the producers decided to send Bond back to his roots with the grittiest, most realistic Bond movie ever. Unfortunately they produced arguably the worst official Bond movie ever. Besides `From Russia with Love', `Casino Royale' is perhaps the most faithful adaptation of a Bond novel. The first third of the movie sets up the story and the rest of the movie picks up where the book begins. There was a complete reworking of the ending to add excitement but it actually served to make things rather confusing.So is it a success? I am a lifelong Bond fan who owns nearly every Bond film on DVD and I would measure this film as one of the best ever. Like Batman Begins, this as a textbook example of how a venerable series can be reworked a correctly. Unlike many Bond fans I was pleased with the choice of Daniel Craig as the new Bond and he exceeded my best expectations. Gone are the asinine Bond one liners. Gone are the crazy gadgets and say farewell to Q and Moneypenny. The core of guns, gorgeous woman and opulent settings remain intact, in fact this may be the most beautiful Bond movie ever created. The only complaint I have is that the music wasn't up to par. For some reason the producers of this generation of Bond films don't seem to be able to capture the fantastic music accompaniments of films like Goldfinger, You Only Die Twice and even Moonraker.Die Another Day made piles of cash but the series was becoming increasingly painful. The absurd stunts, the headache inducing double entendres, the bad dialogue and the silly characters would have eventually done the series in. After Moonraker the producers pulled way back and released For Your Eyes Only. Personally I found Moonraker the more enjoyable of the two. Casino Royale is the best reboot yet and ranks as the best Bond since at least the Roger Moore era. The story is smaller, the characters more believable and the dialogue is VASTLY improved.

1048232,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000MNP2K8,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 6]","The newest entry into the James Bond series probably has the least in terms of cheeky, double-entendre humor and voluptuous femme fatales, but it has the series' trademark action jacked up to current blockbuster standards and a Bond that goes deeper into the iconic character's psyche. Although director Martin Campbell steers the 2006 movie with often breathless pacing and popcorn-level aplomb, it does feel too long at 144 minutes, especially in the last half-hour or so. Some set sequences, while mainly thrilling, feel downright endless like the construction site chase and the collapsing Venetian villa.Fortunately, as the latest 007, craggy-faced Daniel Craig is a charismatic enough actor to sustain interest over the running time. Physically, he cuts a convincing figure as a roughneck agent, though the camera seems overly preoccupied with showcasing his chiseled physique. Not since the young Sean Connery in the role's first incarnation has an actor so successfully redefined the role within the contours of his own screen persona. His natural intelligence and piercing blue eyes bring a surprising soulfulness to the more dramatic scenes, and his roughhewn manner resuscitates a Bond more befitting of Ian Fleming's original vision of a hungry agent intent on proving his mettle.As usual, the plot is impossible to describe without going into detail, but suffice it to say it involves an underground banker named LeChiffre who engineers terrorist attacks on companies in order to short sell their stock. It culminates into a high-stakes poker game (the driest sequence in the movie) and a few necessary deceptions. Written by Neil Purvis, Robert Wade and Paul Haggis, the story feels more substantive this time and less reliant on pyrotechnics in place of character development, probably because the filmmakers were intent on remaining true to Ian Fleming's source novel (Casino Royale).Judi Dench shows up again as the authoritative M, and her role has surprising heft within the story. The other surprise is that the main Bond girl, Vesper Lynd, is also more substantive and complex than usual, although Eva Green plays her in a relatively pallid manner despite the advance. For once, the Bond villains seem as persecuted as Bond himself with Mads Mikkelsen playing close to the vest as the creepily scarred LeChiffre. The two-disc 2007 DVD set unfortunately has no commentary track on the first disc, though the print condition and audio quality are pristine.

This James Bond movie introduces a new identify for Bond, one that is closer to how Ian Fleming wrote about our action hero.Daniel Craig provides a powerful performance as the novice spy who finally becomes part of those who belong to Her Majesty's Secret Service. Some of the scenes are brutal, the action is non-stop, and the opening of the film is so incredible, that we found ourselves glued to the TV.Daniel Craig is handsome in a rugged way, reckless and egotistical, but suave, endearing, and believable. The dialogue between James Bond and his leading lady, while in the train, shall go down in history as one of the most psychologically thrilling give-and take exchanges that serve as an introduction we have ever watched.Not following the right sequence, Judi Dench is ""Q"" in this film, something that given that it is the introduction of Bond, does not follow the time line, but she is magnificent as the exasperated M, who says... ""Bond should have the decency to defect... How I miss the cold war.""The plot is just as the book ordered, and it sends our hero into his first mission, which is to surface the mastermind behind an operation that funds international terrorists. As usual with Bond movies, this film takes us from Uganda to Madagascar, then to the Bahamas, and ends in Montenegro, where James Bond finds himself confronting the enemy during a poker game where millions of dollars are at stake.The leading lady by the name of Vesper is played by Eva Green, and she delivers a superb performance as the woman who captures Bond's heart, only to place a dagger right through it... leaving Bond so hurt that he becomes numb to emotions.As for the gadgets, James Bond receives an Austin Martin that shall become the dream of every fan... a glove compartment filled with all the toys ever dreamed... and prepared to become the perfect emergency room.One of the best lines of all times by James Bond is that he likes his martinis... shaken not stirred, but here we get a twist, for when asked by a bartender how he wants his famous drink prepared... he replies.. ""Do I look like I give a damn?""When this movie was released we watched it at a local theatre, but as soon as we received the DVD from Amazon.com, as we do with all films we own in our collection, we incorporated English sub-titles for the hearing impaired and watched the film with the assurance that we would not miss a single line.Finally, when Bond is tortured, 007 provides another line that shall go down in movie history. Let's hope you can spot it. With a terrifying climax, this movie leaves us with James Bond at his best, and the clamor for... more... more... Bond...

The character is different from the sauve sophistication of the early years, the laughing of the middle years, or the more recent days of Pierce Brosnan.  Craig is about action, and lots of it.  Craig can also share the screen well.  Yes, this Bond film has a love story in its midst, but one cannot come to expect that in future fears (whether that is good or bad, I leave to you).  The chase scene in the construction yard is among the best I've seen; M's character is played brilliantly by Dame Judi Dench - a dramatically powerful actress; and Eva Green greatly exceeds the intellect and romance of past Bond girls while holding her own in a role competing with 007.  While the technological wiz-bang stuff of past films make an occasional appearance, its absence is refreshing.  This Bond is about muscle, force, and measured calculations of employing both to effect an end.  Kill a traitor?  No problem.  Eliminate a bomber?  Piece of cake.  On the other hand, if you're looking for a kindler, gentler Bond now that the cold war is over, look again.

Bluhm,"[13, 19]","My decision to see this film was based primarily on the rave reviews it had gotten, plus the fact that one of the best screenwriters in the business (Paul Haggis) was attached.The best Bond movie ever? The best Bond ever? I suppose that depends on your point of view. If you've been looking for a more ""Americanized"" version of the series, and you prefer your 007 to be more in the mold of  Jason Statham (Transporter 1-2) than the classic Bond types - Connery, Brosnan and Moore - then this one's for you. Speaking of Statham, I couldn't help but think Craig had Statham in mind when he was deciding how he would play one of film's classic roles. However, although I did enjoy Craig's performance in ""Casino,"" I do think he's got a ways to go before he'll be ready for ""Transporter 3.""As for the movie itself, I found it hard to keep track of all the individual pieces and characters, and where they fit into the main theme of the film. The movie was long, and stretched out a bit too thin; I found the story hard to follow, and it seemed, at times, to drift away from the central theme. Some viewers may find this movie confusing and hard to digest if they have a short attention span.The best part of ""Casino"" is the action sequence that takes place in the beginning. (I can see now why Craig was getting hurt so often during the filming). From that point on, the movie drifts along like a barge cut loose from its morings. Toward the end of the film, it began to appear as though the writers had a hard time figuring out where to call it quits; just when you think the end is near (at times I hoped it was), off it goes again in an entirely different direction.Bottom line: give me the old 007 that we've known and loved in the past.

Here's another case where MGM's home-video connection with Sony (and its A/V wizards) pays off big time. From the high-grain b&w; intro to the scenes in the Bahamas and old Europe, the visuals are all stunning -- reference-quality work. The audio starts off strong but distinctly front-biased, but once the big footrace scene starts the 6-D soundstage roars into action.The extras don't follow the template MGM has been using for 007 titles (as on the ""Ultimate Edition""box sets), so look for a collector's edition down the double-dip road. The main docu follows actor Daniel Craig as he becomes Bond -- including footage of the gloomy day when he first met the press -- shaken and stirred by his jet-ski ride across the Thames. Instead of a goofy life preserver, Craig says, he'll use water wings next time. The actor says he was prepared for Bond fan backlash, but when the Internet campaign against him kicked in, ""It did shake me up."" (Apparently the fanboys hadn't checked out the excellent ""Layer Cake."")The second docu is the usual stunt-work chronicle. The third rounds up most of the Bond girls. There's also a lame music video, one of those where the singer wanders around in the movie like he belongs there.The movie comes nicely letterboxed (a cinematic 2.40:1), but there's also a full-screenversion for those who must.

Hopson ""StarWatcher""","[2, 4]","Daniel Craig did a fantastic job as the new 007, and in no way did he disappoint by trying to change the original James Bond persona.  Hard edge, direct, interestingly cool, and sexy as hell- yes, Bond is back! I enjoyed his love-hate relationship with M (a welcome return by superb Judi Dench), and thought the scene where Bond breaks into M's house (to search her computer for some valuable information) and is caught by M, who reprimands Bond as he's about to leave with, ""Don't ever break into my house again,"" a very nice touch. This scene is a primary example of the love-hate relationship between Bond and his superior, M.  ""Casino Royale"" opens with a great scene of Craig doing the famous ""gun barrel"" shot which phases into an artistic title sequence while the ""theme song"" plays.  Bond fans will appreciate the chase scenes with Bond and terrorist plotters, both at a high rise construction sight and at an airport. Thrilling jumps and leaps from the high rise are awesome and the fight between Bond and a terrorist attempting to blow up a plane with a fuel truck is excitingly played out.  And let's not forget about the Bond girls!  Exotic beauty Caterina Murino who first captivates Bond with her beauty, and later pays for her involvement with him with her life.  The movie locales are sumptuous and give the film that ""Bond"" movie look and feel that Bond fans have grown to know and expect.Giving the fine performance that Pierce Brosnan gave as the ultimate suave and debonair Bond, it was difficult to imagine anyone else taking on the role.  When Daniel Craig was named as the ""new James Bond,"" many fans felt as I did- ""who is this guy?""  I'm glad to be able to say that Craig not only succeeded in the role, but also took it to new heights!  I'm eager now to see what the next ""James Bond"" movie will comprise of.  Will there be a ""new"" Moneypenny?  And will we see a new ""Q"" introducing all kinds of high-tech gadgets for Bond to use while on Her Majesty's Secret Service?  After having just seen ""Casino Royale,"" it makes me want to return to the very beginning of the Bond films and start with ""Dr. No"" and watch each of the ""Bond"" films, one per night, until I have seen them all.  The ""Casino Royale"" 2-disc Special Edition DVD is a total blast and is highly recommended for unabashed high rise thrills, airport chases, and attempted murders at Casino tables.

But the movies of late have become so formulaic and staid that the franchise was in danger of a giant leap over the shark.So, the producers of this latest film did exactly what those who made ""Batman Begins"" last year did.  They went back to the beginning, stripped away all the fancy gadgets, pithy one liners and unbelievable plots and got back to the simple idea of a British agent who is a cool, calculating killing machine.There could have been no better choice for this sort of Bond that Daniel Craig.  The man comes aross as coldly single-minded when on a mission.  His affect is calm, well composed and steely throughout the movie.  Watching this guy you can really believe he could wipe someone out without batting an eye.Playing against him is the lovely Eva Green, as different from the stereotypical Bond girl as any woman could be.  The two start off as reluctant team members, with Green's character loathfully dismissive of Bond as a murderous womanizer.  Needless to say, her attitude does a 180 degree turn as the movie unfolds.There are many of the classic Bond accessories, including high tech gadgets and fancy roadsters.  But these serve as spice to liven up an already excellent story, not as the main dish in themselves.  Throw in international intrigue and some fantastic action sequences, and you have a refreshingly original film that stays true to the best of the series.

She is one of those British actors who conceal their enormous skill (clarity of speech, mimic, postures) under a deceptive ease. When acting Shakespeare they can be operatic but when they play ""normal"" characters they appear real, everyday. But try and ask a lesser professional to play an everyday part and you shall see the difference.Daniel Craig is not such a novelty. I loved Timothy Dalton and he was a very physical Bond as well. I am not saying that Mr Craig is a miscast: he seems an excellent actor (I know no other movie of his), he has a beautiful muscular body that the authors display throughout the film, an eastern European (Polish or Russian I should say) look that is peculiar and easy to remember.The authors tried to offer the public an updated 007, very physical, gory, even crude but casting Mr Craig has been useless because they left the rest unchanged. The famous opening scene, Bond and the bomber jumping from a crane to the other is just as improbable as similar scenes in the past Roger Moore movies were.The situations are trite, the villains are mono dimensional, the women are just beautiful and meaningless.And please, the dialogues?These movies are intended for the general public, allright, but do the lines have to be idiotic? Do they have to convey the usual ""Me Tarzan, you Jane"" content and ethics? The only really good exchange?

Based on the first novel in the Bond series, it shows James Bond (Daniel Craig) in the beginning of his career. His mission is to destroy a corrupt banker LeChiffre (Mads Mikkelsen} at the poker tables where he never loses and wins a lot of money to supply the various terrorists' organizations. To accomplish this extremely dangerous task, Bond has to rely mostly on himself; there are no fancy gadgets that Q would provide him with. There is no Q either. I think it is the only Bond movie that lets us look rather briefly behind the Super-agent facade to see more human side of Bond. I don't remember any other Bond movie where he would be tortured in the way that made me truly uncomfortable. I also believe that it is the only (or one of very few) movie where Bond fell in love and as the result of that affair, he would never fell in love again. I have only seen Daniel Craig in two movies before ""Casino Royale"", ""The Mother"" (2003) and  ""Munich"" (2005) but he was memorable in both. As new James Bond, he is fabulous - a marvel to look at, he has unbelievably blue eyes, he is in a great shape (remember, he has to rely only on himself while chasing, fighting, shooting, and killing bad guys) and he delivers a very convincing James Bond, sharp, tough but vulnerable - the Bond for a new millennium.8.5/10",4,Bond Begins - A Royal Treatment,1169251200,"01 20, 2007",2007,1428,"['Casino', 'Royale', '2006', 'directed', 'Martin', 'Campbell', 'different', 'Bond', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'very', 'good', 'Based', 'first', 'novel', 'Bond', 'series', 'James', 'Bond', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'beginning', 'career', 'mission', 'destroy', 'corrupt', 'banker', 'LeChiffre', 'Mads', 'Mikkelsen', 'poker', 'where', 'never', 'lot', 'money', 'supply', 'various', 'terrorists', 'organizations', 'accomplish', 'extremely', 'dangerous', 'task', 'Bond', 'rely', 'mostly', 'are', 'fancy', 'gadgets', 'Q', 'would', 'provide', 'Q', 'either', 'think', 'only', 'Bond', 'movie', 'look', 'rather', 'briefly', 'Super-agent', 'facade', 'see', 'more', 'human', 'side', 'Bond', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'other', 'Bond', 'movie', 'where', 'would', 'be', 'tortured', 'way', 'made', 'truly', 'uncomfortable', 'also', 'believe', 'only', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'movie', 'where', 'Bond', 'fell', 'love', 'result', 'affair', 'would', 'never', 'fell', 'love', 'again', 'have', 'only', 'seen', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'two', 'movies', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'Mother', '2003', 'Munich', '2005', 'was', 'memorable', 'new', 'James', 'Bond', 'fabulous', 'marvel', 'look', 'unbelievably', 'blue', 'eyes', 'great', 'shape', 'remember', 'rely', 'only', 'chasing', 'fighting', 'shooting', 'killing', 'bad', 'guys', 'very', 'convincing', 'James', 'Bond', 'sharp', 'tough', 'vulnerable', 'Bond', 'new', 'millennium.8.5/10']",N/A

But as others have said, there's no Moneypenny or Q, and not many gadgets besides a mobile phone obsession -- Sony Ericsson must have paid a fortune for the repeated product placement.But it's in the changing pace of the movie that it feels least like a Bond film: e.g. the mundane toilet killing that kicks the film off, the rather slow recovery sequence leading up to the building collapse in Venice.The worst aspect of this film is the way it tries to ape '24' -- far too much torture, and little sexual content. The theme song sung by Chris Cornell is also bitterly disappointing. (It must now be more than 10 years since a Bond song zoomed up the UK pop charts.)The best aspects of this film are the opening credits (there's even a witty Mandelbrot reference), Daniel Craig throughout, and the staccato end. The movie also a serious, realistic tone lacking in the Roger Moore and Brosnan eras; you finish watching the movie feeling that not all ends have been neatly tied up. It's more like real life.Craig deserved his Bafta nomination. I strongly suspect that the movie largely got its Bafta nomination because the year is 2 007.

1048265,ANBQIWHO9JRFS,B000MNP2K8,General Zombie,"[3, 6]","I've never cared for Bond films.  Truth be told, my exposure has not been overwhelming, mostly in the form of various hyper-campy 70's versions and the dreadful Pierce Brosnan installments which I've caught in bits and pieces over the years despite my best efforts to avoid them.  No doubt there are films in the series that I would enjoy, but the bad impressions have always left me with little inclination to give them another look  The problem has been, well there have been various problems, but the key one is Bond himself, at least as portrayed by Brosnan and Moore.  He's always supposed to be witty and suave or whatever, but always comes off as completely lame.  I was plenty skeptical about ""Casino Royale"", but the almost universally positive reviews began rolling in, proclaiming it a darker and less campy entry, with a great, intense turn from Daniel Craig.  The reviews were right: Craig is great as Bond, providing one of the finest troubled action heroes in recent memory and washing away the bitter taste of Brosnan's groan-inducing performances.  Equally significant, ""Casino Royale"" has nicely varied, well-constructed and often suprisingly intense action scenes.  As many others have pointed out, ""Casino Royale"" is definitely a bit overlong, but when it's on it's really on, and proves to be more than worth the wait through the slower sections.""Casino Royale"" brings us back to Bond's beginnings, opening with the dual executions that earned him his 00 status.  This black and white, uber-noir opening sequence is simply as cool as all hell.  So damn cool, in fact, that the film has little hope of topping it, and never does.  This points to one of the flaws in the film which is intertwined with the film's excessive length:  ""Casino Royale"" tends to get weaker as it moves along.  The first hour or so is pretty much flat-out awesome, with the great opening being followed by a severely cool free-running style chase through a construction site and into an embassy, and later by an intense, over-the-top encounter in an airport.  Once we really start to get involved in the gambling tournament, however, the film loses some steam.  Turns out that Texas Hold 'Em isn't as thrilling as killing people/explosions/whatever.  Now, there's still some killing at this point, the tournament itself is not without interest, and we've got Eva Green to leer at, but the second act is, nevertheless, unquestionably weaker than the first.  This downward trend culminates in the overlong false ending, though this is partially redeemed by a rather sweet final shootout.  ""Casino Royale"" never loses momentum entirely, not by a long shot, but it definitely could've stood to have the tournament tightened up a bit, and the false ending trimmed by at least a few minutes.  The first hour would've still been the best part, and the first scene the best scene, but the overall difference wouldn't be as glaring.The action-packed first hour proves to be exposition, for the most part, culminating in Bond's foiling of a plot on the part of the film's main villain, Le Chiffre, to destroy a new airplane and reap grand financial rewards via the plummeting stocks.  Bond's intervention costs La Chiffre many  millions of dollars, and, more troubling for Le Chiffre, he is a sort of terrorist banker abd wasn't playing with his own money.  If Le Chiffre can't recoup 100 mil quickly he's a dead man, so he comes up with a peculiar plan: In order to get this cash fast he decides to host an ultrahigh stakes poker tournament at the Casino Royale in Montenegro.  Bond is sent to Montenegro to enter in the tournament and ensure that Le Chiffre loses and then must flee into British custody to save his own life and, as a natural extension, provide valuable on his various clients.Though ""Casino Royale"" is certainly darker than any other Bond film I've seen, it's still very clearly identifiable as one.  It still has some corny humor and a rather outlandish plot, but this is offset by the cold, dangerous Craig and the harsher violence.  Le Chiffre is also a bit toned down as far as Bond villains are concerned.  He's not exactly the most terrifying or intriguing figure around, but he's serviceable enough.  (This is Craig's film, anyway.)  Eva Green plays Vesper Lynn, an accountant sent along to make sure Bond doesn't screw things up too bad.  She's quite credible and grounds the oft-outlandish film a bit, on top of being as hot as hell.Unsurprisingly, the film doesn't end with the tournament in Montenegro, though I won't give away further specifics.  The final act is, again, a bit overlong, but it allows the film to have a bit more emotional impact than it would've had otherwise.  That, and, watching the film a second time, the false ending doesn't take quite as long as it seemed to the first time around, now that you know it's coming, and the final action scene is, again, quite cool.Yeah, that's it.  Cool stuff, enough so that I'm actually looking forward to the next Bond film, whenever it may come out.  I'd not have anticipated that that would ever happen.Grade: B+",4,A Bond film I like?

1048266,ATZ1LTONGHOP6,B000MNP2K8,Genevieve Hayes,"[1, 3]","Set prior to the previous Bond movies, James Bond (Daniel Craig) is sent on a mission to partake in a high-stakes poker game with the aim of bankrupting Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen), the banker to a major terrorist organization.There are two ways that you can look at ""Casino Royale"": as an entry in the James Bond series of movies or as an adaptation of Ian Fleming's novel of the same name. As a Bond movie, ""Casino Royale"" is in many ways a far cry from its predecessors. Gone are the clever quips and the gadgets, yet the makers of this film were smart enough to retain the action sequences (and lots of them), Bond girls (although Eva Green is by no means great) and Judi Dench as M, so there are enough parallels between ""Casino Royale"" and the earlier films to keep fans happy.As an adaptation of the novel, on the other hand, the success of ""Casino Royale"" is less clear. ""Casino Royale"" is far more faithful to its source than any of the Roger Moore Bond films, but not as faithful as the earlier Sean Connery films (in particular, ""Dr No"" - probably the most faithful of all of the Bond movies to its origins). The central elements of the story are taken from the novel, but a lot of extra scenes are added in around them. Almost the entire first hour of the film comprises original material. These extra scenes, however, are, more or less, in the spirit of the novel. The biggest departure from the novel is in the character of Bond himself. The Bond of this movie is an immature, disrespectful loose cannon, while Fleming's Bond is the exact opposite. Several scenes have Bond acting against the direct orders of M, which the Bond of the books would never do.As for whether Daniel Craig makes a good James Bond or not, that will largely depend on your personal tastes. In my opinion, Craig is not a bad actor, but he is nowhere near as effective a Bond as Sean Connery or even Pierce Brosnan.Overall, ""Casino Royale"" is worth watching, and I am glad that someone has finally made a proper film version of this novel (the earlier, David Niven film of the same name bears little resemblance to the book and is one of the worst films I have ever seen), but it doesn't quite live up to the high standards set by some of the earlier Bond films, in particular ""Dr No"" and ""Goldfinger"".",3,"Not the old movie Bond, but not the book Bond either",1240963200,"04 29, 2009",2009,2290,"['Set', 'prior', 'previous', 'Bond', 'movies', 'James', 'Bond', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'sent', 'mission', 'partake', 'high-stakes', 'poker', 'game', 'aim', 'bankrupting', 'Le', 'Chiffre', 'Mads', 'Mikkelsen', 'banker', 'major', 'terrorist', 'are', 'two', 'ways', 'can', 'look', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'entry', 'James', 'Bond', 'series', 'movies', 'adaptation', 'Ian', 'Fleming', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'Bond', 'movie', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'many', 'ways', 'far', 'cry', 'predecessors', 'Gone', 'are', 'clever', 'quips', 'gadgets', 'yet', 'makers', 'film', 'were', 'smart', 'enough', 'retain', 'action', 'sequences', 'lots', 'Bond', 'girls', 'Eva', 'Green', 'means', 'great', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'M', 'are', 'enough', 'parallels', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'earlier', 'films', 'keep', 'fans', 'happy.As', 'adaptation', 'novel', 'other', 'hand', 'success', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'less', 'clear', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'far', 'more', 'faithful', 'source', 'Roger', 'Moore', 'Bond', 'films', 'not', 'as', 'faithful', 'earlier', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'films', 'particular', 'probably', 'most', 'faithful', 'Bond', 'movies', 'origins', 'central', 'elements', 'story', 'are', 'taken', 'novel', 'lot', 'extra', 'scenes', 'are', 'added', 'Almost', 'entire', 'first', 'hour', 'film', 'original', 'material', 'extra', 'scenes', 'however', 'are', 'more', 'less', 'spirit', 'novel', 'biggest', 'departure', 'novel', 'character', 'Bond', 'Bond', 'movie', 'immature', 'disrespectful', 'loose', 'cannon', 'Fleming', 'Bond', 'exact', 'opposite', 'Several', 'scenes', 'have', 'Bond', 'acting', 'direct', 'orders', 'M', 'Bond', 'books', 'would', 'never', 'do.As', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'good', 'James', 'Bond', 'not', 'will', 'largely', 'depend', 'personal', 'tastes', 'opinion', 'Craig', 'not', 'bad', 'actor', 'nowhere', 'near', 'effective', 'Bond', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'even', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan.Overall', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'worth', 'watching', 'am', 'glad', 'someone', 'finally', 'made', 'proper', 'film', 'version', 'novel', 'earlier', 'David', 'Niven', 'film', 'same', 'name', 'little', 'resemblance', 'book', 'one', 'worst', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', ""n't"", 'quite', 'live', 'up', 'high', 'standards', 'set', 'earlier', 'Bond', 'films', 'particular', 'Dr', 'No', 'Goldfinger']",N/A

There is NO opening snow skiing sequence...instead we get a riveting (and I mean riveting) action sequence that takes us high above an African city, into the construction cranes of an under construction building.Then, it's a bit of Bizarro world....If we accept that Dame Judi Dench is the M we're familiar with from the past couple of outings, then we have a bit of a jolt when we realize that Daniel Craig's James Bond is not yet a double O. He has yet to earn that (he quickly does). So based on Judi Dench's presence as M, we're warping backward in time to see Bond reinvented.It's a small price to pay. Dench is great as M and Craig....well, Craig completely reinvents the character. He's bold, brash, callous and reckless. He doesn't play at all the same things Roger Moore (way too foppish), Timothy Dalton (too jaded - but up until now far better than Moore or Brosnan), and Pierce Brosnan (a bit to flippant for me) did.This film also holds the distinction of having the most cohesive and believable of plotlines of any Bond film in recent memory. There are no satellites with death rays. There are no super sci fi plastic surgeries or silly villains (Jaws). This plot has Bond searching for a man who is financing terrorists by very plausible means, who ultimately must risk everything to secure money he lost in an ill fated attempt to sabotage a publicly traded company's newest product. It works. It works absolutely. Is our villain wicked and weird? Oh yeah. But he's also suave, quiet and handsome. Then there's a very underplayed medical condition that causes one tear duct to weep blood. But it's subtle and yet creepy.There's no Q. Bond wins the very famous Astin Martin in a card game.

1048276,A21CFAK6J6H2UI,B000MNP2K8,Goatface Killah,"[1, 5]","I think most people have agreed by now that Casino Royale is one of the best Bond films ever made.  But why do people think this way?  Let me analyze.  Casino Royale has the best aspects that the old Bond films had; good action sequences, a good opening sequence, a cool car, and, of course, the man himself; James Bond.  Except this movie has more than the old films; it has more emotion to it which makes Bond seem more believable as a character, it doesn't get caught up in gadgets, which is good to a certain point, but I know that's one of the reasons I like Bond films in the first place, and it doesn't have any crappy cliches, which, out of respect to Sean Connery, sounded good coming from him.All of these factors make this film worthy of modern day cinema and make the Bond series worth continuing.  But, then I asked myself, does it?  The original Ian Fleming novels were based on Bond saving the world from a sadistic organization called SPECTRE, featured in most of the Sean Connery films.  The awesomeness of the original Sean Connery movies were based on the original Ian Fleming books with SPECTRE, so naturally, if the Bond series is to be restarted, SPECTRE must play a part.  But, SPECTRE's main purpose was to play off of the cold war and benefit from the quarrels that would break out between the U.S., Britain, and the U.S.S.R.  So I began to think, how can they bring back SPECTRE if there's no cold war?The simple answer to this question is, they can't.  The rules of war in modern society have begun to change so that it's no longer quarrels between superpowers where terrorist organizations can get away with stuff.  Now it's countries fighting terrorists directly, so how can they bring back a terrorist organization who benefited from a conflict that's no longer there?From this conclusion, the future of the Bond series looks somewhat different from the memorable series that I remember watching.  And to clarify, people also think that Daniel Craig beats any other Bond.  Not that I don't like Daniel Craig as Bond, in fact he's probably the second best Bond there ever was.

For the first time the unique appeal of this 007 character makes sense under Daniel Craig's interpretation.  Prior Bond films with the varied actors who have portrayed him have gone for the slick, tricky, smart killing machine whose eyes seemed  always on the outlook for the next gorgeous babe he treated with little respect except for physical favors.  The various villainous characters seemed to blend and the stories appeared to be more interested in that tired musical soundtrack theme and carnage than they were in character development.Enter Daniel Craig, all buff and uber-masculine, and the beginnings of James Bond's character are explained in a touching manner, making this machine-like concept a deeper being.  Of course, credit must go to director Martin Campbell working with an intelligent script by Neal Purvis and Robert Wade which travels Craig's Bond from Uganda, to the Bahamas, Miami, Montenegro and Venice.  The chief bad guy this round is Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen) who complete with scarred blind eye and cruel gaze is Bond's nemesis.  Judi Dench turns in another strong performance as the ubiquitous 'M' on charge of 007's ventures and along the way Bond meets such good/bad characters as Giancarlo Giannini, Jeffrey Wright, and the very elegant and stylish French actress Eva Green whose complex character provides all the information we needed to know about James Bond's view of women.CASINO ROYALE is a strong 2 1/2 hour film that for this viewer makes James Bond an interesting character in addition to being a suave stunt/lady-killer man.

1048281,A6I6RZGXIDJD9,B000MNP2K8,"Graeme J. W. Smith ""graemejwsmith""","[6, 10]","When Sean Connery (arguably the ""best"" Bond) quit in the 1960's - the franchise dug deep into the plot line of Ian Fleming's book ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" and produced a movie that many Bond aficionados recognize as one of the best - while introducing George Lazenby in the role. George - sadly - didn't last and the franchise rumbled through some dreadful Roger Moore years propped up by outrageous stunts and sharply pressed dinner jackets. Pierce Brosnan rescued Bond from the dark and foreboding Timothy Dalton - so many were dismayed when he decided to hang up his Walther PPK and leave the producers looking for someone new.So on the day after Thanksgiving - the outlaws and I headed over to the local multiplex where 4 of the 20 screens were showing Daniel Craig's debut in Casino Royale. Glad we dropped by in the morning and bought our tickets early! If you haven't read the books -this was Bond's ""first"" mission for Ian Fleming and the producers have dropped a lot of the ""givens"" and started afresh with the franchise here too. Gone are Eon Productions, many of the ""characters"" who propped the previous movies and ""in"" are financial help from the Government of the Bahamas to place part of the movie there and some pretty overt product placement from Sony and Ford. Thank goodness it was a temporary aberration that had Bond drive a Ford rental, the Aston Martin (albeit Ford owned these days) gets more than a look-in with Bond winning a 1964 DB5 in a card game and later driving (and real world totaling) a DB9 later in the movie. But these little commercialization's in the movie don't detract from Daniel Craig's hard edged killer which harks back to Connery in Dr No when he kills in cold blood - because that is his job.Without spoiling the ending - this movie faithfully follows the twists, turns and doubts of the original 1953 novel. Some scenes are lifted straight from it - notably when Le Chiffre tortures Bond. Of course the movie has been brought up to date in terms of locations, bad guys and the world 53 years after the book was written. But the gadgets are believable PDA's and computers that we all use in the real world - only a little better, the stunts are exceptionally good - and they are believable (well - just!) and the violence is not necessarily gratuitous - though people meet violent deaths when they get in the way.Craig portrays Bond's dilemmas as real spy world, not necessarily black and white but varying shades of grey. Not just in his conscience but in who got disposed of along the way - and should they have been. M has her doubts - Bond has to remind himself that to survive he cannot afford to have doubts. The character forms and introduces himself at the very end of the movie in the very last line - ""The name is Bond, James Bond"".Of course we really are now out of original Fleming novels so it will be interesting to see how we move on from here - but this Bond IS one of the best since the 1960's.

Welsh ""A/V Guy""","[1, 1]","Contrary to what some reviews have said, both on Amazon and other sites like [...], there is a difference in the picture quality between the original Blu-Ray release and the 2 Disc Special Edition Blu-Ray release. The picture on the newer 2 Disc Special Edition has had some sort of re-digitizing and smoothing out. The difference is subtle, but definitely there. Some of the more noticeably grainy shots, like when Bond shoots the ""one bombmaker"", have been affected, although still a little grainy, but the cost of this has been to somewhat mute the colors and tones in the movie. Again, the difference is subtle, and to some, subjectively speaking, it may look better, especially if your HDTV and Blu-Ray player tend to really pump the colors. I personally like the original Blu-Ray release, with the strong colors and tones, and that ""edgy"" look, albeit, with several grainy spots. There is of course no denying the value of the Bonus disc in the 2 disc set, as well as the improved sound, although again, I personally like the more ""edgier"" sound on the original release, but to each his own.

The movie was unlike any Bond film I had seen before.  In fact, the movie is gritty in a way that resembles the very well made Bourne movies.  I recently watched the movie again, and found that it was even more enjoyable the second time around.  The changes, in my opinion are for the better.  I was a fan of Pierce Brosnan in the role of James Bond.  I thought that he had been the best Bond since Sean Connery.  I thought Roger Moore was okay, while timothy Dalton did nothing for me.  Craig made for a very compelling and very human Bond.The visuals in this film are stunning.  The usual opening scenes are - true to form - pretty spectacular.  Bond shows little mercy when it comes to resorting to violence.  He also gets hurt and bleeds on numerous occasions.  He seems ill at ease in a tuxedo, but seems to adapt to the role.  The primary setting for the movie is an incredibly picturesque Venice.  The film features really stunning scenes with some excellent stunt work.  The Blu-ray version is without a dount the version to watch. Clocking in at 144 minutes, the movie seems to fly by with its fast paced story.

1048289,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000MNP2K8,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[3, 5]","Yes, I miss Pierce Brosnan as James Bond...just to get that out of the way. But, even with Brosnan gone, I wasn't really too concerned that they were gonna bollocks the 007 franchise up too badly. I'd just seen LAYER CAKE and had been quite impressed with Daniel Craig's dynamic performance. So I knew I was in for a good time with CASINO ROYALE. This version - not to be confused with the wacky 1967 version with David Niven and Peter Sellers - is James Bond as Ian Fleming had written him in the novels, stripped bare of those cute cinematic touches. James Bond here is a cold and arrogant killer who hasn't yet perfected that veneer of wit and sophistication.Here come the crazy SPOILERS: CASINO ROYALE tells of the genesis of James Bond as Daniel Craig takes 007 back to his early days of having just been elevated to 007 status. Instead of the suave operator we're used to, what we glimpse is a raw, thuggish secret agent, whose clumsy modus operandi is ""let's poke the bear and see what happens."" This is never more typified than in two sequences in the film: during a thrilling, expanded chase thru a construction site where the grace and athleticism of Bond's target is contrasted with Bond's bull-in-a-china-shop methods of pursuit and, much later, in the casino, wherein Bond, fearing that he'd run out of options, prepares to crudely knife down his victim. Now, even in his later film exploits, Bond never really strays too far from his penchant for ""poking the bear,"" but he does become more refined about it. It's interesting to note that, at that time of his career, even though he was already a cold-blooded killer, one particularly brutal, life-or-death struggle on a flight of stairs still was able to unnerve him, post-encounter.It's also worth mentioning that James Bond doesn't toss out a lot of one-liners here, although he does offer up a memorable barb after a failed attempt to give him a cardiac arrest. But, mostly, Bond keeps his mouth shut and his eyes open as he...learns to mold himself into his later, more dashing incarnation. In this movie, you could practically see the wheels of origin inexorably turn. We witness the evolution of various 007 fixtures, ie: his experimentation with the martini drink, his presumably first run-in with an Aston-Martin, his first meeting with CIA agent Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright), his first utterance of ""Bond...James Bond,"" and his seemingly debonair but ultimately callous handling of women. Alas, we have no Q present and a bare minimum of cool gadgets, but Dame Judi Dench is here as M, which actually sets up a paradox because, in later films, Judi Dench now has to replace herself as the new M (in GOLDENEYE, chronologically). But that's just quibbling.Daniel Craig is a great and virile James Bond. He's got a presence that is very physical, intense, and commanding. The charm of Bond here doesn't come from urbane elegance and clever wordplay as much as from a wellspring of animalistic vitality. And, as ably proven in LAYER CAKE, the guy can act. Throughout the film, there's a sense of pent-up energy emanating from Craig, as if, at any moment, he could explode in a miasma of action. Also, his craggy face and his icy blue eyes lend him credibility as a straight-up killer. In a negative way, Pierce Brosnan and Roger Moore's pretty, good looks placed them too high up in  fantasy world, their exploits admired from afar but difficult to relate with. Craig, who's blessed with a rugged, blunt handsomeness but isn't too good-looking to piss a guy off, has a better chance here to come across as more ""real."" In the self-assuredness that he wears like a cloak, Craig borrows from Sean Connery. In muscular physique and physicality, he's closer to former male model turned actor George Lazenby (ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE). In fact, CASINO ROYALE and ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE also share one other thing in common besides the two leads' pumped up brawn: they are the only two films where Commander Bond has truly fallen in love.The plot of the movie, if looked into too closely, is boring. Roughly, it involves Bond, as his first 007 mission, having to beat a terrorist broker at cards in a high stakes casino tournament so that the prize money isn't used to fund terrorist activities. The film benefits from a slam-bang opening sequence, then the opening credits, followed immediately by another excellent action sequence. Afterwards, the pace  becomes leisurely and, with the advent of the casino scenes, decidedly  becomes even more leisurely. But, don't fret; here and there, the movie throws enough cinematic bones to keep the viewer contentedly glued to the screen. Eva Green as Vesper Lynd is smoking hot but seems to lack the same sensuality she showcased in DREAMERS. But there's decent chemistry between her and Craig. Mads Mikkelsen is perfectly adequte, if routine, as Le Chiffre, the main baddie who weeps in blood and has a gambling jones. But, naturally, Daniel Craig is head and shoulders and biceps and pecs above everyone else. And, as a sidenote, he really sells that torture scene. Ouchie.With only his first outing, Craig seems to have already cemented his place in the 007 pantheon. I hate to say this but Craig just might be the 2nd best Bond ever, after Sean Connery, of course. Unfortunately, this drops Brosnan, who I really like as an actor, to third place. Hopefully, Craig will keep up the quality with the inevitable sequels. But, for now, so long, Pierce Brosnan.

1048290,AVTVGFPCE0GI8,B000MNP2K8,H. D. Harvey,"[2, 5]","When I first heard that Daniel Craig was going to play the next James Bond I was a bit suspicious.....a blond Bond??? But the more I heard about it the more I wanted to see it. I actually waited until it was released on dvd to see it. I can say, hands down, Craig is the best and the coolest Bond since Connery and Moore. Pierce Brosnan and Dalton have nothing on this guy!! Daniel Craig is really the ultimate. Superb acting, the action scenes are fantastic - it's been a long time since I've seen such a great and entertaining movie. Craig just melted into the Bond role so easy, and I don't think there's ever been a sexier guy playing Bond. I think Pierce Brosnan, even if he was pretty good, was a bit too proper and seemed to think about the way he looked too much. Craig doesn't seem to think about the way he looks so much, or so it seems....that's what makes him so good also. He seems to take it as a bit of a joke. He's not full of himself.

Could blond indie thug Daniel Craig REALLY step into the rarified shoes of Connery, Moore, Brosnan, et al to portray one of the most beloved and long-running icons of cinema?  Though I respected Mr. Craig's acting ability in gritty British drama, at first blush his fit for the role of Bond was not apparent.  I attended a screening with very low expectations, prepared to hate a movie that had booted my beloved Pierce Brosnan out of the franchise.  Well.  To say that Mr. Craig blew me away would be an understatement.  He totally owns the part now and we have to stretch all the way back to Sean Connery to find a Bond with such confident physicality married to a dangerous edge.  Mr. Craig is not ""handsome"" in the classic sense.  But he's compelling, virile and relentlessly watchable--a potent combination that's way better than mere ""handsome"".  Though I submit that those blue eyes are one of the wonders of the cinematic world, and when Mr. Craig smiles (not often enough as Bond, alas), it's like the sun breaking out over the Aegean, and he is handsome, indeed.  His physicality is unsurpassed, even by Connery; his rising up out of the surf is an iconic moment in the Bond canon--Ursula Andress as beefcake.  The reviewer who labelled Mr. Craig 'effete' must have had a long doze, because the man drips masculinity from every pore.  The stunts, locations and set pieces are all spectacular, but the overriding reason to purchase this on DVD is to appreciate, with repeat viewings, the nuances of Craig's performance.  I have found reason to be fond of all the previous Bonds, but Craig is hands-down the most skilled actor to ever take the role.  Bond is by definition, 'larger than life', but in Craig's hands, we are not watching a caricature of a superman in a tuxedo, but a real man in a dangerous occupation who sweats and bleeds and suffers, who makes mistakes and learns from them.  He moves Bond beyond the one-note sexism and gadgetry and actually creates a fully-fleshed person who seems almost real.  Mr. Craig has definitively silenced his critics, and has become a Bond for the ages.  Whether his sophomore effort can maintain the high bar he set here remains to be seen, but ""Casino Royale"" has captured his Bond at the height of his considerable powers, and is a must-own.",4,"Daniel Craig: Definitive, Delicious  Double-Oh",1225411200,"10 31, 2008",2008,2416,"['confession', 'back', 'late', '2006', 'opening', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'was', 'one', 'clamoring', 'pack', 'doubters', 'Could', 'blond', 'indie', 'thug', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'REALLY', 'step', 'rarified', 'shoes', 'Connery', 'Moore', 'Brosnan', 'et', 'al', 'portray', 'one', 'most', 'beloved', 'long-running', 'icons', 'cinema', 'respected', 'Mr.', 'Craig', 'acting', 'ability', 'gritty', 'British', 'drama', 'first', 'blush', 'fit', 'role', 'Bond', 'was', 'not', 'apparent', 'attended', 'screening', 'very', 'low', 'expectations', 'prepared', 'hate', 'movie', 'had', 'booted', 'beloved', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'franchise', 'Well', 'say', 'Mr.', 'Craig', 'blew', 'away', 'would', 'be', 'understatement', 'totally', 'part', 'now', 'have', 'stretch', 'way', 'back', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'find', 'Bond', 'such', 'confident', 'physicality', 'married', 'dangerous', 'edge', 'Mr.', 'Craig', 'not', 'handsome', 'classic', 'sense', 'compelling', 'virile', 'relentlessly', 'watchable', 'potent', 'combination', 'way', 'better', 'mere', 'handsome', 'submit', 'blue', 'eyes', 'are', 'one', 'wonders', 'cinematic', 'world', 'when', 'Mr.', 'Craig', 'not', 'often', 'enough', 'Bond', 'alas', 'sun', 'breaking', 'out', 'Aegean', 'handsome', 'indeed', 'physicality', 'unsurpassed', 'even', 'Connery', 'rising', 'up', 'surf', 'iconic', 'moment', 'Bond', 'canon', 'Ursula', 'Andress', 'beefcake', 'reviewer', 'who', 'labelled', 'Mr.', 'Craig', ""'effete"", 'must', 'have', 'had', 'long', 'doze', 'man', 'masculinity', 'pore', 'stunts', 'locations', 'set', 'pieces', 'are', 'spectacular', 'overriding', 'reason', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'appreciate', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'nuances', 'Craig', 'performance', 'have', 'found', 'reason', 'be', 'fond', 'previous', 'Bonds', 'Craig', 'hands-down', 'most', 'skilled', 'actor', 'ever', 'take', 'role', 'Bond', 'definition', ""'larger"", 'life', 'Craig', 'hands', 'are', 'not', 'watching', 'caricature', 'superman', 'tuxedo', 'real', 'man', 'dangerous', 'occupation', 'who', 'bleeds', 'suffers', 'who', 'mistakes', 'learns', 'Bond', 'one-note', 'sexism', 'gadgetry', 'actually', 'fully-fleshed', 'person', 'who', 'almost', 'real', 'Mr.', 'Craig', 'definitively', 'silenced', 'critics', 'become', 'Bond', 'ages', 'sophomore', 'effort', 'can', 'maintain', 'high', 'bar', 'set', 'here', 'be', 'seen', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'captured', 'Bond', 'height', 'considerable', 'powers', 'must-own']",N/A

And the final result has been a certain lack of good taste, accustomed refinement and a set of traditional issues we use to watch; the absence of a striking soundtrack that nourishes the action, the absence of the traditional opening with the figure of Bond looking us through a virtual eye, the presence of Money Penny, the new technological devices with the used spices of double sense occurences and  the accustomed black humor.The new Bond lacks of European flavor and persuasive seduction spirit. All the previous characters (with the only exception of Georges Lazenby of Australian origin and Pierce Brosnan from Ireland), were from U.K., even the handle of the elements of tension which introduced us to the main plot, were marvelous shot, with a mesmerizing kinetic energy.But this time, it seems the globalization has knocked at the door of this character, and well you know, a change has to come and turn around the state of things. Bond doesn't make use of his Aston Martin with all the lot of unthinkable special effects and hidden weapons we used to expect, the fabulous chases, with that so well elaborated dynamics.The forces of evil even have lost that arrogance and cynical behavior to become simple gangsters. There's an impressive lot of moving sequences, as the first human chase,for instance or the attempts of making Bond a viction of the violence, and lack of luminosity around the sinisters enemies who must conspire against the world peace are absent.Casino Royale has always been a turning point, a cordial and pleasant stop on the road, a divertimento, but taking into account this was the debut role of Daniel Craig, maybe this dare attempt to make to exploit the screen didn't result as sophisticated as one expected.

Daniel Craig has convinced me that the 40+ year old franchise will be in good hands for years to come. While I don't believe that there has ever  been a bad actor to portray Ian Flemings creation I feel that each one has brought a different dimension to the role geared towards his strengths. But let's be honest, Connery is still the best because he has that right balance of charm and wit that'll make you smile one moment and then beat you to a bloody pulp the next. But overall I like Craig because he approaches the character closer to the Fleming books and that's not a bad thing although that may turn some people off.What I really love about this movie is the way we get to see how James Bond becomes ""James Bond"" and I think its quite refreshing and fun. I also think Vesper Lynn is quite possibly the most fully realized and best developed Bond girl since Tracy Draco in ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service."" It's also nice to see a more realistic villian in LeChiffre for a change instead of the take over the world types we ushally see. I also think the ending is one of the best ever in the series.Director Martin Cambell does a fine job and it's no coincidence he also directed the best Pierce Brosnan Bond in ""Goldeneye"".The only gripe I have with Casino Royale is the Title song by Chris Cornell .

This was easily one of the best action movies I have watched in a long time.  My wife, who generally falls asleep watching movies and doesn't care much for action movies loved it.

Whoever were the writers did an excellent job - it did not seem put together just to make money from a big franchise name that is James Bond.  The thing I found hilarious was some of the British sexual humor.  It was at times so in you face, I was dying laughing!This bond is a little different than previous Bonds, though.  He has just became a ""double O"", so the movie shows the bond character more raw and less refined than other bond movies (as I guess you would expect for someone who's new to being a double O), but it is very convincing in this movie and I don't think it would have been as entertaining had he been more ""Bondish"".  I watched the movie twice I liked it so much, and my wife wanted to as well (which is really saying something considering all she likes almost are ""chick flicks"").If you are the type that rents many movies, but only buys the best ones you would watch more than once, then you will NOT be dissapointed if you add this one to your keeper list.",5,The Best Bond Next to Connery.

Able to take care of himself, yes.  Women liked him and men wanted to be him.  Sean Connery, the quintessential Bond, is difficult to match.  No, we don't expect anyone else to have the same appeal on screen, but we don't really want to lose sight of the original, either.Daniel Craig was not the actor many people expected, and some were disappointed, all before the movie was released.  It seemed an interesting choice to me and I was curious about how he would come across.  I'm glad to say he wasn't bad.  Buff, oh my yes.  Ruggedly handsome, yes.  Even tender once.  But there was no sense of fun.  No rascal.  Mostly just deadly.As for the screenplay -- well, too much of nearly everything.  The first action scene, which everyone always looks forward to, went on forever.  I actually went out of the room twice during it, and still got to see the end.  Other action scenes could have been shortened.  And the brutal scene where Bond is naked -- too much for me; I don't know how a man could stand watching it.  A half hour could have been cut easily overall, maybe more, making the story more immediate and more about the characters.  Younger movie goers might have thought the brutality was all right, but us older folks can do without it.  There are also a few times when something is missing in the story line, and the scene or sequence doesn't make sense.Judi Dench as always was wonderful.  Mikkelson was not the campy villain we're used to, he's just plain psychotic.  Green is a believable, and lovely, love interest.  And the scenery takes one's breath away.

Personally, Casino Royale has made it into my Bond top 5 with the likes of Goldfinger and From Russia with Love.This is a James Bond reset, putting the audience in the view of Bond as a brand new double-0. To see Bond develop in Casino Royale was quite a spectacle since James Bond may be one of the least developed long-time Hollywood characters. The most emotion anyone may have ever had for Bond would have been back in On Her Majesty's Secret Service.In addition to great development of both character and plot (plot is always the key to a good Bond film), Daniel Craig absolutely blew my socks off with his performance! Next to Sean Connery, Daniel Craig may perhaps be the best Bond yet. I am an avid fan of all the Bond actors (yes, even Roger Moore when I'm not considering Moonraker), and Daniel Craig really stands out. Hopefully, Craig will go on to make a few more excellent and noteworthy Bond films to add to this fun series.And for those who could care less about Bond, Casino Royale is, put simply, the best action film of 2006. Great bad guys, amazing stunts, exciting story, high tension, etc. It's all one could ever ask for. The story entails a VERY high stakes Texas Hold 'em tournament (although we all know poker was not Bond's game of choice, it is an appropriate update for the new generation Bond), deceit, greed, politics, and of course a little bit of old-fashioned Bond romance.And lastly, a very important note, the Bond girls in Casino Royale are absolutely unforgettable. Eva Green gives a memorable performance, and was perfect playing opposite Daniel Craig. Having seen her in Kingdom of Heaven prior to this, I was very excited (for good reason) to see her in Casino Royale.

1048309,A1E8RJN1L9UMHX,B000MNP2K8,IKCWMBFD,"[13, 19]","Obviously, this is just one of those films that by its very nature gets very different reactions running to the extremes. Any time you make some major changes to a long-running series (20 films!), some people are going to be happy and some people will be upset. So, if you are trying to gauge from the widely divergent things reported about this film what you're going to think, you are probably in for a hard time. Honestly, if you haven't seen it, you should probably just get it over with and judge for yourself. I think perhaps that the changes have been exaggerated and that, underneath it all, there's more continuity than the uproar would indicate. As everyone should agree, the facts are this: they hired a new blonde actor, reduced the reliance on implausible gadgets and outsized special effects, cut down on one-liners and outright comedy, and gave you a plot that didn't involve saving the world from destruction but rather focuses on trying to win at cards so as to bankrupt a financial backer of terrorism. The movie shows us Bond's two first kills and has him as newly promoted to double-0 status but is set in the present, which seems to cause some people continuity headaches (no Q, no Moneypenny in this one). The use of traditional Bond theme music is unusually minimized here but for a good reason, since this movie is sort of about Bond becoming Bond. There are fewer big action set pieces in this one than usual; some people seem not to like the opening chase sequence through a construction site, finding some of the stunts and choreography un-Bond like. Some have griped that the style of the action scenes would feel more at home in a film about Jason Bourne or John McClane than James Bond. While I enjoyed the action quite a lot myself, I can't say either criticism is off base: the airport sequence does feel quite Die Hard-like and the opening chase had tons of trendy parkour elements (a la B13 but more over the top). The movie runs almost 2 1/2 hours and has several quiet stretches which seem to have triggered impatience in some viewers.But of course, the really major complaint goes: Daniel Craig is no (insert your favorite Bond actor or Clive Owen or whoever). (Just for the record, I am a Connery guy (favorite Thunderball) and thought Clive would be a fabulous Bond.) This is no small matter: If you just don't like Daniel Craig for some reason, you are just not going to like this film, since who plays Bond is pretty much everything. After all, had Connery been in On Her Majesty's Secret Service, I suspect a lot of people would say that was the best Bond ever made. Similarly, Dalton, a relatively decent actor, simply didn't cut it for me as Bond, lacking the necessary magnetism and charisma that Connery had established for the character, so those films are not among my favorites. Moore and Brosnan seem to be the preferred Bonds of viewers who prefer to use words like ""suave"" or ""charming"" to describe Bond: neither actor projected real physical prowess or a dangerous quality and their films tended therefore to accentuate the quips, the technology, and the unflappable sophistication of Bond as globe-trotting superspy. Craig has been characterized by a lot of reviewers as a return to the physicality that Connery brought and this is true. I think Craig successfully projects physical confidence and manly prowess in carrying himself similar to the way that Steve McQueen used to pull it off. And Craig's Bond gets sweaty, looks to be almost in tears from pain, gets bloodied and bruised, and seems genuinely capable of pounding someone in a fistfight. I think this is all to the better: these films are action adventure films after all and having a lead who is convincing on this score is a pretty good idea.But I think not enough has been made of the use Casino Royale makes of Craig's acting ability. Having seen Layer Cake, I felt pretty optimistic about Craig's ability to carry a movie like this but I was surprised at how much I liked him in the part. Too often, Bond has been rather bland and dull because he has been, frankly, too good at what he does. But I was impressed in this film at how, by zeroing Bond out, by making Bond a relatively untested younger agent, DRAMA has returned to this series.  Craig's Bond is impetuous, arrogant, and occasionally foolish. It is remarkable how many poor decisions, how many unnecessary risks, how many misreads he makes in the course of this narrative if you look closely at how the action unfolds. And Craig is given the chance to display a far wider range of emotions and intensities than Bond has generally been allowed. In fact, Casino Royale, it seems to me, is really the first Bond FILM in quite some time; the character of Bond the person and the small particulars of the story matter, rather than what you are watching being merely a series of big budget stunts strung together.Whereas some seem to feel the movie drags late or becomes boring after they move to Casino Royale, I thought the opposite; when the movie got smaller and began to focus on the character interactions, the movie got better. Many people have complained specifically about the poker scenes as being too long. I disagree: they show you only hands that actually establish something important for the storyline, and the fact that nothing blows up to me does not equate to dull. There is plenty of intrigue going on in the Casino during and between the cardplaying to keep it from getting boring. Mads Mikkelsen is much more subtle here that the typical lead Bond villain is asked to play it (see Pusher 2 for more of him) and I think his casting indicates that the makers of this film want to you watch the human interactions in this film more carefully, that the characters here were not intended to be simple caricatures. And the two Bond women in this film, while both pleasurable to the eye in typical fashion, project a human quality which strikes me as rarely achieved in the series; Eva Green's Vesper is much more successfully developed than the typical Bond girl. To be clear, a Bond film is and should probably continue to be a male fantasy throwback and this film, despite the repeat presence of Judi Dench as the boss M, is no p.c. creation simply for having somewhat more realistic women characters than usual. It's notable that unlike many contemporary action films, violence is in this film a completely male domain: there's no woman beating up or shooting a bunch of guys demonstrating equality through brutality. It's just that one-dimensional bad guys and one-dimensional gorgeous shapely women alike generally make for more boring movies than multi-dimensional bad guys and gorgeous shapely women.I'm sure this film's detractors would simply disagree that the things I describe were successful for them and would say they still didn't like the movie, whatever it was trying to do, add drama and character or not. Despite my rating it 5 stars, I readily admit that the movie is not in any way flawless and I focus here only on the positives. And anyone who loved all the Brosnan films and has kept up their interest all these years could rightfully question why there was a need for the series to take a different approach. Which does sort of lead to the objection all the little objections add up to, which is, this movie doesn't really feel like a JAMES BOND movie to the people who dislike it. And those people certainly have every right to feel that way. But for me, this series has for a long time flirted with self-parody and camp, and I didn't feel much reason to see another installment in what was seeming increasingly routine and uninspired formulaic stuff; most of the recent Bonds didn't strike me as ""fun"" at all and I couldn't sustain enough interest to make it all the way through Die Another Day. I know several people, similarly burned out, who have seen this movie and been surprised at how much they liked it and these are, I think, the people the franchise is trying to win back. So for me, I haven't really felt like the movies in this series have been authentically ""Bond"" for quite some time, and I feel that this one is the most worthwhile one in ages. I worry a bit that the next one will start to move in the wrong direction without an original Fleming novel to ground it, with the pressure to restore some of the elements they stripped out of this one to please everyone. It might not work out. But for the meantime, this one has restored my faith in the series.",5,you can't please all of the people all of the time,1174348800,"03 20, 2007",2007,8491,"['Obviously', 'just', 'one', 'films',

1048313,A24I3BMB9JZC7O,B000MNP2K8,"Ingrid Heyn ""No man is an Iland, intire of it...","[0, 2]","... and it's not only the Bond of this film which is shaken, but the entire franchise.Fans of the James Bond films have reacted with vituperative insults, slamming the film and (as Daniel Craig mentions in the special effects DVD of the 2-DVD set) sending scathing and vicious hate-mail to the new Bond. I can see why - many watchers of the James Bond films have a very specific idea of what they want in a Bond film, and it's often NOT a case of knowing the books and wanting the films to be faithful to that. How could it be, after all? From Roger Moore onwards, there does seem to have been quite a noticeable swing towards the concept of making James Bond almost a spoof of himself.This film is actually truer to the books than the earlier films were.The ""traditional"" James Bond (by which I mean the Bond many viewers today expect, based on the Bond films, especially on the more recent ones) is then not really the ""real"" Bond whom Ian Fleming created.I can't pretend to be an avid Bond fan - I'm not. But I've enjoyed pretty much anything that Sean Connery has done, and I feel that Connery did a superb job of creating a ruthless, hard character who was in many ways a sexual predator, a dysfunctional being, but one who was brilliantly unstoppable as a secret agent, and blazing with intelligence, sexual power and suave charm. Roger Moore's Bond was too reminiscent (in my opinion) of Simon Templar, the Saint (a role which I think suited him much better than Bond). And so on... I felt the recent Bonds had wonderful potential, but were hampered by increasingly silly plots and overwhelmed by gadgets. Yes, we all love the spoofiness of all of those gadgets, but they were already too much over the top - they could no longer be taken seriously. Ditto for the villains - they were caricatures rather than serious characters, and because of that, they failed (in my opinion) to present a real source of tension in the films.I'd heard that this film - Casino Royale - was a break in the tradition. I'd admired Daniel Craig's acting in Munich, and thought that this was a Bond film worth watching...... and in my opinion this is a very interesting film, well acted, well scripted, well directed. The film achieved what those involved wanted to achieve - this Bond is a harder, quite brutal Bond without the experience of the later Bonds (because he only gains his double-oh status in the beginning of this film), but still self-aware and with a disarming self-knowledge that has him able to laugh about himself. I found myself believing in this Bond, and that is not something I can say of previous Bonds (except for Sean Connery, but then... Sean Connery, after all... what more need I say?).I think those who want Bond films to have a spoof-like quality with amazing gadgets and unbelievable and over-the-top villains will probably not like this film. For those who want an intelligent and intricate action/thriller, the film will probably please. Daniel Craig is of course an extremely good actor, and he has the right face for this sort of hard-edged role. He is able to express so much just with the look of his eyes and the tiny movement of muscles around the mouth - he does most of his acting with his face. But his physicality comes in very useful here too, in some of the most realistic fight scenes (and a taxing torture scene) that have made it to the screen.The various villains are believably played, and Le Chiffre is particularly well done. Le Chiffre is the sort of villain that previous Bond films would have overplayed.The women are of course all ravishing, and as Vesper Lynd, Eva Green does a good job of creating an initially armoured woman with her own secrets.Unlike many, I very much enjoyed the intricacy of the card game - it's a hard thing to shoot, and it worked for me.There are several quite breathtaking extended chase scenes or fight scenes, and I don't think I'll forget the fight scene on the steel girder, the car chase where Bond's car rolls seven times, and (ouch) the scene in a cellar where Le Chiffre uses a rope on Bond to illustrate how elaborate gadgetry for torture is completely unnecessary.I give this film 5 stars for being successful in its genre. I don't think it's a film without flaws, but the successful tension, exciting look and good acting throughout make it work.",4,Not the Bond of recent films - definitely shaken,1176076800,"04 9, 2007",2007,4328,"['not', 'only', 'Bond', 'film', 'shaken', 'entire', 'franchise.Fans', 'James', 'Bond', 'films', 'have', 'reacted', 'vituperative', 'insults', 'slamming', 'film', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'mentions', 'special', 'effects', 'DVD', '2-DVD', 'set', 'sending', 'scathing', 'vicious', 'hate-mail', 'new', 'Bond', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'many', 'watchers', 'James', 'Bond', 'films', 'have', 'very', 'specific', 'idea', 'what', 'want', 'Bond', 'film', 'often', 'NOT', 'case', 'knowing', 'books', 'wanting', 'films', 'be', 'faithful', 'How', 'could', 'be', 'Roger', 'Moore', 'onwards', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'quite', 'noticeable', 'swing', 'concept', 'making', 'James', 'Bond', 'almost', 'spoof', 'himself.This', 'film', 'actually', 'truer', 'books', 'earlier', 'films', 'traditional', 'James', 'Bond', 'mean', 'Bond', 'many', 'viewers', 'today', 'expect', 'based', 'Bond', 'films', 'especially', 'more', 'recent', 'ones', 'then', 'not', 'really', 'real', 'Bond', 'whom', 'Ian', 'Fleming', 'created.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pretend', 'be', 'avid', 'Bond', 'fan', ""'m"", 'not', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'pretty', 'much', 'anything', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'done', 'feel', 'Connery', 'did', 'superb', 'job', 'creating', 'ruthless', 'hard', 'character', 'who', 'was', 'many', 'ways', 'sexual', 'predator', 'dysfunctional', 'being', 'one', 'who', 'was', 'brilliantly', 'unstoppable', 'secret', 'agent', 'blazing', 'intelligence', 'sexual', 'power', 'suave', 'charm', 'Roger', 'Moore', 'Bond', 'was', 'too', 'reminiscent', 'opinion', 'Simon', 'Templar', 'Saint', 'role', 'think', 'suited', 'much', 'better', 'Bond', 'so', 'felt', 'recent', 'Bonds', 'had', 'wonderful', 'potential', 'were', 'hampered', 'increasingly', 'silly', 'plots', 'overwhelmed', 'gadgets', 'Yes', 'love', 'spoofiness', 'gadgets', 'were', 'already', 'too', 'much', 'top', 'could', 'no', 'longer', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'Ditto', 'villains', 'were', 'caricatures', 'rather', 'serious', 'characters', 'failed', 'opinion', 'present', 'real', 'source', 'tension', 'films.I', ""'d"", 'heard', 'film', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'was', 'break', 'tradition', ""'d"", 'admired', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'acting', 'Munich', 'thought', 'was', 'Bond', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'opinion', 'very', 'interesting', 'film', 'well', 'acted', 'well', 'scripted', 'well', 'directed', 'film', 'achieved', 'what', 'involved', 'wanted', 'achieve', 'Bond', 'harder', 'quite', 'brutal', 'Bond', 'experience', 'later', 'Bonds', 'only', 'gains', 'double-oh', 'status', 'beginning', 'film', 'still', 'self-aware', 'disarming', 'self-knowledge', 'able', 'laugh', 'found', 'believing', 'Bond', 'not', 'something', 'can', 'say', 'previous', 'Bonds', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'then', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'what', 'more', 'need', 'say', '.I', 'think', 'who', 'want', 'Bond', 'films', 'have', 'spoof-like', 'quality', 'amazing', 'gadgets', 'unbelievable', 'over-the-top', 'villains', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'film', 'who', 'want', 'intelligent', 'intricate', 'action/thriller', 'film', 'will', 'probably', 'please', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'course', 'extremely', 'good', 'actor', 'right', 'face', 'sort', 'hard-edged', 'role', 'able', 'express', 'so', 'much', 'just', 'look', 'eyes', 'tiny', 'movement', 'muscles', 'mouth', 'most', 'acting', 'face', 'physicality', 'very', 'useful', 'here', 'too', 'most', 'realistic', 'fight', 'scenes', 'taxing', 'torture', 'scene', 'have', 'made', 'screen.The', 'various', 'villains', 'are', 'believably', 'played', 'Le', 'Chiffre', 'particularly', 'well', 'done', 'Le', 'Chiffre', 'sort', 'villain', 'previous', 'Bond', 'films', 'would', 'have', 'overplayed.The', 'women', 'are', 'course', 'ravishing', 'Vesper', 'Lynd', 'Eva', 'Green', 'good', 'job', 'creating', 'initially', 'armoured', 'woman', 'own', 'secrets.Unlike', 'many', 'very', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'intricacy', 'card', 'game', 'hard', 'thing', 'shoot', 'worked', 'are', 'several', 'quite', 'breathtaking', 'extended', 'chase', 'scenes', 'fight', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ll"", 'forget', 'fight', 'scene', 'steel', 'girder', 'car', 'chase', 'where', 'Bond', 'car', 'rolls', 'seven', 'times', 'ouch', 'scene', 'cellar', 'where', 'Le', 'Chiffre', 'rope', 'Bond', 'illustrate', 'how', 'elaborate', 'gadgetry', 'torture', 'completely', 'unnecessary.I', 'give', 'film', '5', 'stars', 'being', 'successful', 'genre', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'film', 'flaws', 'successful', 'tension', 'exciting', 'look', 'good', 'acting', 'make', 'work']",N/A

Since then, I have watched all the Bond films, and none seem to have the depth nor character development usually required in a real film.This Bond movie is different. This is a different kind of Bond and a different kind of a Bond film.Daniel Craig plays a Bond with a actual psyche. Yes, Bond has feelings now! He even has psychological vulnerabilities!Vesper Lynd, played so skillfully by Eva Green, pokes at Bond's vulnerabilities by guessing, presumably correctly, ""you are an orphan!....you did not come from money and your friends at Oxford NEVER let you forget it!"".The fight sequences has Bond getting hurt and even getting a few scratches on his face. Yes, Bond gets hit and gets hurt too. Whoever thought that was possible? Bond is far from mythical, he is all too human.

Martin Campbell went back to the basics, retooling Bond and giving him a much more physical presence, reminiscent of Sean Connery.  From the opening sequence we see we are in for a real treat, as Campbell takes nothing for granted.  He knows he has to earn the audience's respect, and he does with a thrilling chase scene in the chaotic urban center of an African republic.Bond really comes across as a rogue agent in Casino Royale, stealing his way into M's apartment to leave her coded messages, taking risks that threaten painstaking operations and getting himself into jams that require MI6 to bail him out.  This is a young impetuous Bond, overanxious and thrilling to watch as Craig fills his role with the energy of a stage actor.There is also one of the best villains in recent years with Mads Mikkelsen as the cold blooded Le Chiffre.  He heads an international cartel not so much bent on world destruction as on taking advantage of the chaos in which we live.  He is a much more believable villain than Spectre and relies on much simpler methods of getting his piece of flesh from someone.It is also refreshing to see Bond have a real love interest in Eva Green, not the usual banter that rings hollow.  Bond is not afraid to expose himself in this movie, revealing a much more vulnerable figure than we have seen before.MI6 also finds itself as a much more porous organization, capable of being infiltrated so that Bond doesn't know who to trust in key moments.  All he has is the support of M, played to deadpan perfection by Judi Dench.Everything about this movie is fresh and clean, including the opening credits.  Bond hasn't looked this good since the early films in the series with Sean Connery.

1048325,A24D0DENA8N7GH,B000MNP2K8,James Sadler,"[6, 12]","To my mind, the last great Bond movie was ""You Only Live Twice."" Admittedly, it paled somewhat in comparison to its predecessors-- ""Dr. No,"" ""From Russia with Love,"" ""Goldfinger"" and ""Thunderball""-- but given much of followed it, it truly was the last great Bond movie.Of course, some of the credit for what powered those first five movies has to go to Sean Connery. Connery was Bond, as far as the public was concerned, and he spent years shaking that image off.True, he did appear as Bond again in ""Diamonds Are Forever"" and ""Never Say Never Again,"" but both of those were mediocre efforts. In fact, if rumors are true, and they probably are in this case, the only reason he made ""Diamonds"" was for a very sizable paycheck.Connery's successors just couldn't get it right; sometimes because of the tepid to idiotic scripts they saddled with, and sometimes because they just didn't fit the role.George Lazenby, a complete unknown, gave a good effort in ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service,"" which was sandwiched in between ""Twice"" and ""diamonds,"" but the storyline wasn't that great and he also faced the considerable challenge of being the guy who immediately followed Connery into the role. He was largely derided and pretty much disappeared, appearing in an occasional movie role.Roger Moore seemed like a logical choice, after all, he was Ian Fleming's original choice. Moore, however, ushered in the error of goofiness and occasional slapstick.And he himself never took the role seriously. A fact which carried over onto the screen. He did have two decent efforts with ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" and ""For Your Eyes Only,"" but those films were average at best. He also had the distinction on making ""Octopussy,"" the worst Bond film to come from Cubby Broccoli line of Bond films.Timothy Dalton brought acting cred to the role, but never seemed comfortable with it. And many of us, including me, just didn't buy him as Bond, despite his reputation as a good actor.Pierce Brosnan came along, and he actually seemed like a good choice. He had actively campaigned for the role when Dalton got it, but was prevented from getting it because of his ""Remington Steele"" TV contract.Brosnan was an acceptable Bond, but his physical appearance (the guy was pretty much rail thin and lacked any muscularity), kept many of us from believing he was capable of actually engaging in the physical tasks Bond constantly faces.He does have the distinction of appearing in the best of the non-Connery Bonds, at least pre-""Casino Royale,"" with ""tomorrow Never Dies."" But, thankfully, either he grew tired of the role, or the producers decided he was getting too old.Which brings us to Daniel Craig. A worthy successor to Connery, and a guy who might even surpass Connery in the role someday.Before ""Royale"" was released, Craig was the subject of campaign determined to deem him totally unacceptable as Bond. Websites took glee in pointing out he appeared to short, his hair was the wrong color, and a whole host of other real or imaged offenses they believed him guilty of.I was originally sorta in this camp. But after seeing him in ""Holocaust,"" I was suddenly convinced he could pull it off.And he did.Of course, Craig benefited from a ""back-to-basics' approach to the franchise. ""Royale"" was the book that introduced Bond and, coincidentally, the only one not made into a film by the Broccoli family, who owned the rights to all the Bond books except ""Royale.""Well, luckily they gained the rights and decided to start the franchise over. And Craig proves to be a great choice for the role of Bond. Blonde hair or not (it seems like they colored it darker in some parts of the film, and not in others), you come to believe he is Bond. In fact, given the opening sequence, and an intense chase seen that follows the opening credits, he's probably the most physical Bond ever.Like Connery, he brings a certain cool detachedness to the part. something you'd expect from a guy who is in many ways an assassin on the British payroll.He's also taking on a believable bad guy, which helps tremendously. Let's face it, the bad guys can make or break these films. Just think how Auric Goldfinger still looms as the standard against all other bad guys must be judged in the film series.And ""La Chiffre,"" like Goldfinger, is a guy who is quietly sinister.La Chiffre is the banker to rich bad guys of the world. Only he makes the mistake of putting all of the money he's entrusted with into an airline stock, and shorting it. ""Shorting"" a stock amounts to betting that the stock will lose value and, well, you don't want a lesson in stock trading here do you? Let's just say, La Chiffre loses his arse on the stock market and his clients aren't too happy.So he sets up a high stakes poker game in Montenegro, figuring that because he's a bit of a mathematical and probability expert, he can't lose and he'll win back all the money he lost on the stock market.Enter Bond, freshly minted as ""007,"" and sent into the game only because he happens to be the best card player in MI6. M doesn't yet trust him, but she knows he's their best bet to win, causing La Chiffre, and all his dirty little secrets, to come running to MI6 and the Americans for protection from his clients.Naturally, things don't go quite as planned, and Bond is double crossed more than once. He also is subjected to a torture scene that actually tells us a lot about the new Bond--he's tough, a bit sadistic in his own right and maybe even a little masochistic.The film is the most satisfying Bond film since ""Twice,"" which was released in 1967. So, nearly 40 years later, they finally get it right. Again.It's not perfect. They take their time telling the story, and it does seem to drag a little toward the end when Bond is recuperating from injuries. It also never quite convincing explains the motives of one of the characters who double crosses Bond. But you might disagree. See it. It's well worth buying for multiple viewings.",4,"Almost 40 Years Later, They Finally Get it Right Again",1174262400,"03 19, 2007",2007,5967,"['mind', 'last', 'great', 'Bond', 'movie', 'was', 'Only',

1048326,A3PI8VVFKUQ8FD,B000MNP2K8,"James T. Walczak ""Lomitus""","[4, 8]","While there seems to be a lot of rallying support for ""the new Bond"", I can't say that I'm with that group at all.  Casino Royale was ""ok"" and certainly 1000% better than the Woody Allen/Peter Sellers sham, but compared with more traditional Bond movies, I felt it left a great deal to be desired.First there was the tragic demise of a well established timeline.  This could have been easily avoided by simply adding that the ""previous"" Bond had retired (or been killed) and that the new agent was simply replacing his predecessor, the way ""M"" and ""Q"" had been replaced as the actors portraying them aged and/or passed away. To ""re-envision"" such a well established franchise completely without paying tribute to that which has come before was simply a mistake.Then there is Daniel Craig's less than impressive portrayal of one of the most well known ""action heros"" of all time.  Let's face it here...whether you are a fan of the books or the movies, when someone mentions the name ""James Bond"", it provokes a certain mental image.  Regardless of who has portrayed Bond in the past, there is an image of a suave, sophisticated individual usually wearing a tux, drinking a vodka martini (shaken, not stirred).  The image certainly includes having a beautiful woman on his arm, fancy gadgets to help him out of a tight spot and that attitude that ""laughs in the face of danger""...usually accompanied by a ""pithy come back"".  With the introduction of Daniel Craig in Casino Royal, gone is the tongue in cheek humor that typically accompanies the James Bond persona.  To me this was a tragic mistake as it is simply a part of who James Bond is.  In the Bond movie ""Golden Eye"" for example, there is a scene where Bond (portrayed excellently by Piece Brosnan) crashes a tank he is driving in a chase scene (wonderful in it's own right!).  The camera zoom's in on Bond as he pauses, straightens his tie then continues with the chase.  Truly a wonderful moment of humor to say the least!  There are no such ""moments"" with this new Bond...he is simply a man with a bad attitude and ""a chip on his shoulder"" who's out to prove himself against the world.  With Craig's portrayal, the character of James Bond could have just as easily been a disgruntled shoe salesman who's forced to smell stinky, fat feet day in and day out.  I'm sorry to say but Craig does a very poor job of ""filling the shoes"" of his predecessors.To use a food analogy, if you make spaghetti sauce without any spices what so ever, all you end up with is tomato soup.  Daniel Craig's portrayal of Bond is watery tomato soup at best.  While Sean Connery, Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan (and even Dalton and Lazenby) all brought something new and unique to the role, they all managed to maintain the principle character that is ""Bond"".  Here particularly, Craig falls abominably. While it is a ok action film with a fairly average plot (save the world...yawn), there is nothing in Craig's portrayal that really says ""James Bond"" in any way.  The character names could have been easily changed and very simply, it would not have effected this movie at all (and probably would have been for the better).Gone too are the wonderful gadgets that are so iconic of James Bond movies.  While a good story line is certainly the greatest success of any film let alone ""Bond"", high tech gadgetry is something that most loyal fans have come to expect (for example the submarine Lotus in ""The Spy Who Loved Me""...priceless!).  When watching James Bond using many of these devices, one can easily hear Q's words of wisdom saying ""Grow up 007!"".  Such things are now apparently a part of the distant past.  Apparently all a modern secret agent needs any more to defend himself against the evils of the world is his ever loyal and faithful cell phone.For the sake of fairness, I will add that there have certainly been other Bond ""flops"".  Connery's ""Diamonds Are Forever"", Moore's ""Man With The Golden Gun"" and ""Moonraker"" and Brosnan's ""Die Another Day"".  I guess even the best of Bonds are entitled to having a bad run.  That said, it appears that this may not be a one time event due to the fact that the producers seem to want to take Bond in a new (and horrifying) direction.  We loyal Bond fans can certainly hope but none of us should hold our breath for too long either.Final Thoughts...For those who are looking for an average action film with the proverbial explosions and car chases and an otherwise average plot, you will probably be satisfied with ""Casino Royal"".  However for those like me who are long time fans of the James Bond franchise and all that it represents, you will probably be sorely disappointed.  In and of itself it was an ""ok"" movie but it certainly wasn't ""Bond"" by any stretch of the imagination.  It would have been better to simply change the character names and call this film something else and just let the Bond franchise rest until something better and more appropriate came along.",2,Casino

Easily (easily) the best Bond movie since From Russia with Love; frankly, it is the best Bond movie ever. The reason is that it is the first of the films that manages to be even faintly realistic, that is character as much as plot driven. The plot in fact is nothing special, but the handling of the scenes is refreshingly raw and gritty (not quite Bourne Identity, but close enough); for the first time ever, James Bond seems like a real personality and not just a fantasy figure, capable of suffering and other human emotions. Special praises go to Craig, who is a revelation. Eva Green doesn't do badly either: tho she weirdly fluctuates between divinely pretty and almost mannish (she looks way better without make-up), Green is extremely affecting as the first flesh and blood Bond girl. What really distinguishes this movie from other Bonds, however, is the touch of a real writer - Paul Haggis, whose hand is evident throughout the proceedings. There is actually something going on beneath the scenes now, psychological undercurrents, character dynamics, tensions; at least half the time, this is not just a good Bond movie: it's a good movie. I didn't even notice that the Bond theme wasn't being used until moments before the end when it finally appears - I had almost forgotten I was watching a Bond movie at all (yes, that's a compliment). These last few moments, after all that has gone before, made me very nearly euphoric. Never mind the fact that they celebrate Bond's acceptance of his fundamental soullessness and embracing his dubious destiny as a cold-blooded killer fantasy hero!

1048331,A2ZWTA18X37QOZ,B000MNP2K8,"Jason Oey ""UltramarineX""","[8, 14]","**Warning: Possible Spoilers**Maybe it's because I'm so used to the portrayals of Bond by Sean Connery, Roger Moore, and Pierce Brosnan, that I couldn't connect with Daniel Craig's Bond as easily.  Personally, I was expecting Bond to be a far more suave character in this movie, but Craig's Bond was a lot darker and harsh than previous Bond incarnations.  Frankly, I thought that Casino Royale was a pretty good movie, but not as good as I thought it was going to be, especially after hearing all the critical praise it was getting.The plot of this movie revolves around Bond trying to stop a man named Le Chiffre, who is a member of an organization that funds terrorists worldwide.  Bond is sent to play against him in a high stakes poker game that would cause the collapse of Le Chiffre's organization should Bond win.  One thing I enjoyed about Casino Royale was that it was full of great twists and double-crosses, many of which were completely unexpected.  This is something you don't often see in a Bond movie.The action scenes in this movie are definitely top notch.  My favourite scene involved Bond chasing down a man in Madagascar.  In this scene, the man that Bond was chasing moved almost as he were Spider-Man, while Bond himself was struggling to catch up, and had to come up with innovative ways to get to him.  This chase was a perfect way to emphasize the fact that he is new to the double 0 spy game.  Also, the scene where Bond tries to stop a man from blowing up an airliner in Miami may be derivative at first glance, but it was fun nonetheless.So now you must be wondering why I didn't give Casino Royale a higher score.  Well, first off, the relationship between Bond and Vesper Lynd (played by Eva Green) felt a little too forced, almost as if it was simply put in there to forward the plot, and not much more.  Also, the pacing in the movie was a little uneven, especially towards the end of the movie, where it looked like the movie was going to end at several points, but just kept on going.  Lastly, this movie just felt that it was about 20 minutes longer than it should be.  Personally, if I were the editor I would have cut out a lot of the unnecessary scenes between Bond and Lynd, as they did little to add to the overall movie.As I previously mentioned, Craig's Bond is not the type of Bond that I am used to.  The character was just way too brooding for my tastes.  However, this is not necessarily a knock against Daniel Craig's acting ability.  I have seen him in a few other movies in the past, and he is perfectly suited to play a rougher Bond, as clearly shown in Casino Royale.  I appreciate the fact that the creators of this movie wanted to try something different to shake up the franchise's formula, but I'll wait on the next movie to say whether they've succeeded or not.In the end, Casino Royale is a pretty good action movie, but it just wasn't as good as I hoped it would be.  However, I am more than willing to give Daniel Craig's Bond another chance, and as such, I will hold judgment on this new take on Bond until the next movie comes out.My final score: 7/10 (a mild thumbs-up)",3,"A pretty good action flick, but not as good as I hoped",1163808000,"11 18, 2006",2006,3132,"['**Warning', 'Possible', 'Spoilers**Maybe', ""'m"", 'so', 'used', 'portrayals', 'Bond', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'Roger', 'Moore', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'could', ""n't"", 'connect', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'Bond', 'easily', 'Personally', 'was', 'expecting', 'Bond', 'be', 'far', 'more', 'suave', 'character', 'movie', 'Craig', 'Bond', 'was', 'lot', 'darker', 'harsh', 'previous', 'Bond', 'incarnations', 'Frankly', 'thought', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'especially', 'hearing', 'critical', 'praise', 'was', 'getting.The', 'plot', 'movie', 'around', 'Bond', 'trying', 'stop', 'man', 'named', 'Le', 'Chiffre', 'who', 'member', 'organization', 'funds', 'worldwide', 'Bond', 'sent', 'play', 'high', 'stakes', 'poker', 'game', 'would', 'cause', 'collapse', 'Le', 'Chiffre', 'organization', 'should', 'Bond', 'win', 'One', 'thing', 'enjoyed', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'was', 'was', 'full', 'great', 'twists', 'double-crosses', 'many', 'were', 'completely', 'unexpected', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'often', 'see', 'Bond', 'movie.The', 'action', 'scenes', 'movie', 'are', 'definitely', 'top', 'notch', 'favourite', 'scene', 'involved', 'Bond', 'chasing', 'down', 'man', 'Madagascar', 'scene', 'man', 'Bond', 'was', 'chasing', 'moved', 'almost', 'were', 'Spider-Man', 'Bond', 'was', 'struggling', 'catch', 'up', 'had', 'come', 'up', 'innovative', 'ways', 'get', 'chase', 'was', 'perfect', 'way', 'emphasize', 'fact', 'new', 'double', '0', 'spy', 'game', 'Also', 'scene', 'where', 'Bond', 'stop', 'man', 'blowing', 'up', 'airliner', 'Miami', 'may', 'be', 'derivative', 'first', 'glance', 'was', 'fun', 'nonetheless.So', 'now', 'must', 'be', 'wondering', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'higher', 'score', 'Well', 'first', 'relationship', 'Bond', 'Vesper', 'Lynd', 'played', 'Eva', 'Green', 'felt', 'little', 'too', 'forced', 'almost', 'was', 'simply', 'put', 'there', 'forward', 'plot', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'Also', 'pacing', 'movie', 'was', 'little', 'uneven', 'especially', 'end', 'movie', 'where', 'looked', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'end', 'several', 'points', 'just', 'kept', 'going', 'Lastly', 'movie', 'just', 'felt', 'was', '20', 'minutes', 'longer', 'should', 'be', 'Personally', 'were', 'editor', 'would', 'have', 'cut', 'out', 'lot', 'unnecessary', 'scenes', 'Bond', 'Lynd', 'did', 'little', 'add', 'overall', 'movie.As', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'Craig', 'Bond', 'not', 'type', 'Bond', 'am', 'used', 'character', 'was', 'just', 'way', 'too', 'brooding', 'tastes', 'However', 'not', 'necessarily', 'knock', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'acting', 'ability', 'have', 'seen', 'few', 'other', 'movies', 'past', 'perfectly', 'suited', 'play', 'rougher', 'Bond', 'clearly', 'shown', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'appreciate', 'fact', 'creators', 'movie', 'wanted', 'try', 'something', 'different', 'shake', 'up', 'franchise', 'formula', ""'ll"", 'wait', 'next', 'movie', 'say', ""'ve"", 'succeeded', 'end', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'pretty', 'good', 'action', 'movie', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'hoped', 'would', 'be', 'However', 'am', 'more', 'willing', 'give', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'Bond', 'chance', 'such', 'will', 'hold', 'judgment', 'new', 'take', 'Bond', 'next', 'movie', 'out.My', 'final', 'score', '7/10', 'mild', 'thumbs-up']",N/A

I can't pick one, because each one of them actually pretty well reflect the particular times, and for that, I can even forgive and enjoy Roger Moore.  Of course, the least appreciated today probably is Timothy Dalton, which is not really fair in my opinion, especially considering he had the best &#34;gun barrel&#34; sequence (I'm talking about the shooting stance).

And while the Brosnan Bond films all did well, and were (by and large) fun and exciting, the series as a whole really had been getting stale.  Initially the thought of firing Brosnan in favor of somebody new and fresh was an act of outright lunacy.  It seemed even more so when it was announced the new Bond would be blonde actor Daniel Craig.  Let me OFFICIALLY renounce my previous observations and accept Craig as hands down my favorite Bond from this point on.  The only thing now that will ruin the most successful movie franchise of all-time is a poorly written plot.From virtually the opening scene, you can immediately tell there is something quite different from Bond films of the past.  Gone are the smarmy, half-witted jokes that became standard starting with 'From Russia With Love'.  Daniel Craig just isn't the type to pull that off, which is one of the chief reasons why I believe most people counted him out as even being capable of playing the role.  Instead the writers chose to give us an entirely different Bond altogether.  On the surface this borders on sacrilege, but TRUST me, it has infused some much needed adrenaline into this aging character.  Erasing all previous Bond movies and starting from scratch seems to have been a great gamble on the part of the producers.  The opening scene of any Bond film has always been one of tremendous thrills and action sequences, and I have to give credit to Daniel and everyone involved for giving us quite possibly the greatest chase scene yet--and get this: it doesn't involve a car, truck or any motorized vehicle of any kind.  Strictly on foot.  It was absolutely flawless and breath-taking.  Simply incredible.  And the film only got better from there.High praise, huh?  Indeed it is, and yet I wonder if I have accurately portrayed the film as good as it actually is.  All I can say is this: if you once believed that nobody could replace Sean Connery (or Roger, or Pierce or...) you owe it to yourself to see how Daniel Craig has quite literally not just taken over, but he's done it with brutal force.  If you took every actor who has played Bond over the years and while in their prime placed them side-by-side, it would be impossible not to see that Craig is the best of the bunch physically.  And he more than proves it with the action sequences.  Bond is no longer a guy who can seemingly walk through a hailstorm of automatic gunfire without so much as a hair out of place...nope, THIS Bond is the real deal who isn't afraid to get down and dirty and he DOES get hurt along the way.

Maybe, they just got burn. He is reckless with other people lives and he lost some sympathy there. Second, the movie is too long.

My first Bond was Roger Moore in ""Live and Let Die"".  Roger used to be my favorite, until I was old enough to appreciate Sean Connery.  I was not sure what to expect with this new version of Casino Royale, as the first one was my least favorite Bond movie, if you can even call it that. The first Casino Royale was a spoof of spy movies, along the same line as the Goldmember movies.  I was very pleased with the new version of Casino Royale, and I especially like the ""new"" version of Bond.This new era of Bond, takes us to the beginning of James Bond, as he makes his seemless transition from agent to special agent ""007"".  Daniel Craig has such a presence on screen as the present day Bond.  Strong, athletic, powerful, and ruthless.  Craig has the charm and intelligence to match wits with the various Bond villains, women, and of course M, played by the always impressive Judi Dench.  Some reviewers are critical of Craig's performance, but I found him believable and dangerous in taking on the challenges of Le Chiffre(Mads Mikkelsen), and the new mysterious organization that is funding terrorist groups around the World.Bond's new romantic lead is British treasury official Vesper Lynd (Eva Green).  Eva has the beauty and quick wit to keep up with Bond throughout the film.  However, as the film plays, certain events transpire that may lead one to believe whose side Vesper is really on.Casino Royale takes us all over the world to exotic locations, something we come to expect from Bond films.  In Casino, we visit Uganda, Madagascar, the Bahamas, and Montenegro for a high stakes poker game, with a 10 million buy-in.  The cinematography is excellent.  And I especially enjoyed the scenes of the construction site brawl and the floating house on a canal.  Watching this movie on Blu-ray was visually stunning, and the audio was outstanding.Special Features on the DVD:*  ""Becoming Bond"" : Takes us from Ian Fleming's 1st spy novel, CasinoRoyale, and the transition to film.  Also, how Daniel Craig wascasted as the 6th Bond actor.*  ""James Bond : For Real"" : This segment showed how the various scenesand their stunts were filmed.  The stuntmen definitely earned theirkeep on this film, especially the driver who flipped 7 times duringthe Ashton crash scene.*  ""Bond Girls Are Forever"" : Ex-Bond girl Maryam D'Abo flies around theWorld to interview some of the more popular Bond girls from UrsulaAndress to Halle Berry and in between.*  ""Chris Cornell Video"" : featuring a video of the song played in theopening credits.*  ""Previews"" : Rocky Balboa, The Pursuit of Happiness, Stranger ThanFiction.Where is the trailer for the movie?  I am disappointed it is not on the DVD.Casino Royale is definitely a great film in the James Bond library.  Great fights, great women, great locales, and a new, ruthless James Bond in Daniel Craig.

Shimkus ""Movie Manji""","[8, 11]","What gives this film clear favor, in surprising conviction for me, is not the same told story by Ian Fleming, nor the fabulous environments, nor the beach bodies, nor anything that makes a bond film...well, a bond film. I can't give too much credit to the supporting cast, yet the bleeding eye guy still resounds on the creepy scale for me. What becomes outstanding is the calous, the damaged ego, the serious, deliberate, pure state in which Danial Craig seems to portray in what is a breath of fresh air that we can all celebrate about. I was seized onto his performance, his deeply absorbed expressions into the field of enjoyment I did not think possible considering the marketing of this film. It was my father, and friends who dragged me kicking and screaming into the theater to watch it. ""no, not another mindless bond film. barely exhilerating!"" I've read that every bond film gives its generation what it needs. The seriousness of this film, and the thought that perhaps the team involved with this film had to ""earn it audiance"" was a feeling that I wish many more studio films had today. A super spy killer film for us who live in a world of insecurity and constant threats, a little bond meant to shake our perceptions of who James Bond could be, not stirred as those, now jubilant fans, who once instantly branded the blond bond as impossible. Bond is more important now than the sum of his ""products"", which Q lavished onto him with an almost silly carelessness as to its use and expiration. Thus, as we are now learning for ourselves. We cannot allow our government, nor can we afford, the luxury of carelessness nor must we allow operations to be handled behind the scenes with only words of assuredness' to comfort our fears.

1048351,ATS1HA5M3EPZ4,B000MNP2K8,"J. Elmquist ""Moviephile""","[4, 7]","Casino Royale takes James Bond and turns him inside out...in a good way.  This is the movie Pierce Brosnan wanted to do as James Bond.  He begged and pleaded with the producers to make a movie that showed a Bond stripped down and dirty.  It's a shame too, because it's a great flick.This is by far one of the best Bond flicks ever.  Let me put this in perspective for you; I think Sean Connery is great, but I never knew him as 007.  I grew up on Roger Moore as James Bond.  For Your Eyes Only, The Spy Who Loved me...those were great.  Then came Timothy Dalton.  Dalton tried hard and I respect his effort, but the only two movies he did fell flat on their face.  Then came Brosnan, who I thought was superior to Dalton and Moore in all ways.  The first three movies he did as Bond were excellent.  Without a doubt they re-energized the franchise in the best ways.Then they made Die Another Day, and I felt really sorry for Brosnan.  In an effort to go back to campy stunts and overblown F/X in an attempt to celebrate the anniversary of Bond, they made it too over the top.  Now it seems someone with a brain has come in and made everyone take a few steps back and decided to show everyone why James Bond is who he is.Casino Royale starts with 007's second assignment.  It involves a kill, and as his victim finds out, it's much easier the second time.  Yes, considerably.  The chase sequence at the beginning through a construction zone in Madagascar will leave your jaw dropped.  Then as the movie moves on to the exotic locales like the Bahamas and Montengro (always stunning locations in Bond movies) we notice almost right away this is a different Bond.  Full of ego and confidence he's vicious and much more violent then what we're used to.  Tending to solve his problems with fists and bullets rather than brains and cunning.  M (brilliantly played again by Judi Dench) refers to him as a `Blunt Instrument' and his failure to see the `Big picture' causes issues with his own foreseen outcome in some situations.Now to the good part; Daniel Craig as James Bond, 007.  What were they thinking?  Putting a critically acclaimed actor in the role of one of the world's most beloved Spy characters?  Well someone what thinking clearly!  Craig is by far the most accomplished actor to take on the role  even though he doesn't quite fit the part with his blonde hair and...good GOD those EARS!  Nevertheless, he loses himself in the role so deeply that you finally feel like this is a real person, a real character.  Not a characture.  When ordering a Vodka Martini and asked, `Shaken or Stirred', we get a firm `Do I look like I give a damn' in accordance with the characters mood at the moment.  We are treated to a Bond who feels, gets angry, gets reckless and most of all, falls in love.  As his relationship with Vesper Lynn (Eva Green) builds, our affection for her does as well.  We find ourselves liking this woman as much as he does.  Again, this movie takes a step back and shows us why Bond is the way he is, and it's a near perfect execution.  It's just...those damn ears!As with any Bond movie there are women and tuxedos, cards and martinis and a villain with an unusual character trait.  But strangely, no Moneypenny.  No Q, no gadgets!  I was somewhat disappointed in this but didn't really miss it.  The character study shows us something we have finally never seen in James Bond, something Brosnan tried to get the producers to do a long time ago but for some reason, they wouldn't.  I think Pierce would have been great in this movie, he was my favorite Bond but I do think Craig could surpass him depending on the next installment.  But most importantly, Casino Royale jump starts the franchise once more, and gives them a place to start from all over again.",5,Bond is back and no one does it better.,1179273600,"05 16, 2007",2007,3780,"['Casino', 'Royale', 'James', 'Bond', 'out', 'good', 'way', 'movie', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'wanted', 'do', 'James', 'Bond', 'begged', 'pleaded', 'producers', 'make', 'movie', 'showed', 'Bond', 'stripped', 'down', 'dirty', 'shame', 'too', 'great', 'flick.This', 'far', 'one', 'best', 'Bond', 'flicks', 'ever', 'Let', 'put', 'perspective', 'think', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'great', 'never', 'knew', '007', 'grew', 'up', 'Roger', 'Moore', 'James', 'Bond', 'Eyes', 'Only', 'Spy', 'Who', 'Loved', 'were', 'great', 'Then', 'came', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'Dalton', 'tried', 'hard', 'respect', 'effort', 'only', 'two', 'movies', 'did', 'fell', 'flat', 'face', 'Then', 'came', 'Brosnan', 'who', 'thought', 'was', 'superior', 'Dalton', 'Moore', 'ways', 'first', 'three', 'movies', 'did', 'Bond', 'were', 'excellent', 'doubt', 're-energized', 'franchise', 'best', 'ways.Then', 'made', 'Die', 'Day', 'felt', 'really', 'sorry', 'Brosnan', 'effort', 'go', 'back', 'campy', 'stunts', 'overblown', 'F/X', 'attempt', 'celebrate', 'anniversary', 'Bond', 'made', 'too', 'top', 'Now', 'someone', 'brain', 'come', 'made', 'everyone', 'take', 'few', 'steps', 'back', 'decided', 'show', 'everyone', 'why', 'James', 'Bond', 'who', 'Royale', 'starts', '007', 'second', 'assignment', 'kill', 'victim', 'out', 'much', 'easier', 'second', 'time', 'Yes', 'considerably', 'chase', 'sequence', 'beginning', 'construction', 'zone', 'Madagascar', 'will', 'leave', 'jaw', 'dropped', 'Then', 'movie', 'exotic', 'locales', 'Bahamas', 'Montengro', 'always', 'stunning', 'locations', 'Bond', 'movies', 'notice', 'almost', 'right', 'away', 'different', 'Bond', 'Full', 'ego', 'confidence', 'vicious', 'much', 'more', 'violent', 'then', 'what', ""'re"", 'used', 'Tending', 'solve', 'problems', 'fists', 'bullets', 'rather', 'brains', 'cunning', 'M', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'again', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'refers', 'Blunt', 'Instrument', 'failure', 'see', 'Big', 'picture', 'causes', 'issues', 'own', 'foreseen', 'outcome', 'situations.Now', 'good', 'part', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'James', 'Bond', '007', 'What', 'were', 'thinking', 'Putting', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'actor', 'role', 'one', 'world', 'most', 'beloved', 'Spy', 'characters', 'Well', 'someone', 'what', 'thinking', 'clearly', 'Craig', 'far', 'most', 'accomplished', 'actor', 'take', 'role', 'even', ""n't"", 'quite', 'fit', 'part', 'blonde', 'hair', 'good', 'GOD', 'EARS', 'Nevertheless', 'role', 'so', 'deeply', 'finally', 'feel', 'real', 'person', 'real', 'character', 'Not', 'characture', 'When', 'ordering', 'Vodka', 'Martini', 'asked', 'Shaken', 'Stirred', 'get', 'firm', 'Do', 'look', 'give', 'damn', 'accordance', 'characters', 'mood', 'moment', 'are', 'treated', 'Bond', 'who', 'angry', 'reckless', 'most', 'love', 'relationship', 'Vesper', 'Lynn', 'Eva', 'Green', 'affection', 'as', 'well', 'find', 'liking', 'woman', 'as', 'much', 'Again', 'movie', 'step', 'back', 'why', 'Bond', 'way', 'near', 'perfect', 'execution', 'just', 'damn', 'ears', 'Bond', 'movie', 'are', 'women', 'tuxedos', 'cards', 'martinis', 'villain', 'unusual', 'character', 'trait', 'strangely', 'Moneypenny', 'No', 'Q', 'gadgets', 'was', 'somewhat', 'disappointed', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'miss', 'character', 'study', 'something', 'have', 'finally', 'never', 'seen', 'James', 'Bond', 'something', 'Brosnan', 'tried', 'get', 'producers', 'do', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'reason', 'would', ""n't"", 'think', 'Pierce', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'movie', 'was', 'favorite', 'Bond', 'do', 'think', 'Craig', 'could', 'surpass', 'depending', 'next', 'installment', 'most', 'importantly', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'jump', 'franchise', 'once', 'more', 'place', 'start', 'over', 'again']",N/A

I'm sure my sister and I would have preferred a Disney movie at the time, but even at our age, it was pretty impressive when Sean Connery got his Mustang up on two wheels. Between that fateful starry night and now, I have ended up seeing almost every James Bond movie. To me, taking James Bond back to the basics--literally, back to square one--might have seemed a daunting task, as the 007 franchise had been waning in recent years (for a myriad of reasons) and the idea of a ""prequel"", if you will, may have been rather risky.Fortunately, this fined-tuned Bond is what a lot of fans have been clamoring for, and new addition Daniel Craig brings James into the 21st century with thuggish aplomb. Curt, compact and arrogant, he's a secret agent who isn't above making big mistakes; his own ego often times his worst enemy. James attempts to infiltrate a terrorist organization, and within the first ten minutes the film has globe-trotted so far across the map that you may be wondering who all these villains are and what their place in the story actually is (the movie opens curiously in black-and-white, with a confrontation and also with a flashback!). Judi Dench's ""M"" really lets James have it for 'needlessly' killing a bomber whom they hoped to interrogate, but she has a change of heart (indeed, quite a number of them) after Bond becomes involved in a high-stakes poker game in Montenegro with terrorist-operative Le Chiffre, a real poker-face (and asthmatic!) with a bloody tear duct. Watching him made me realize he was the weakest villain of all time. I heard the book was more interesting with an equally fantastic history of him. I also thought Mads Mikkelsen was miscast. Lambert Wilson probably would have been a much better choice.""Casino Royale"" is packed with thrills; it looks terrific and has many moments of action, romance, macho violence, and even beauty.

I didn't much care for his last Bond film either. But now we once again have a good film along with a good actor for the part - Daniel Craig in ""Casino Royale""!I hate to say it, but Ian Fleming's novel ""Casino Royale"" was quite possibly his weakest Bond novel, but this film takes his novel and manages to be both faithful to it while also making it good. Apart from the beginning (which is great and action-packed), this film stays pretty close to the novel. The plot is pretty much the same except for a few miner details they HAD to change because of the times. The novel was written in the early 50s and this film is set in 2006. The James Bond character is much like Ian Fleming's Bond rather than the previous film versions that we've seen. And for the most part the film is action-packed and pretty exciting. And Bond once again has a meaningful relationship with the girl. The last time a Bond film tried that was in 1969's ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"".The only thing that hated about this film was that Vesper's and Bond's relationship goes on for too damn long before anything actually happens. It would have been fine if they cut out the scene where Bond and Vesper were on the beach because that scene was unnecessary and boring. If they had just left that scene out, this would have been the best Bond film yet.Never the less this was still a great and action-packed film.Highly recommended!",4,Finally a good actor for the part again!,1271808000,"04 21, 2010",2010,1541,"['never', 'liked', 'Bronson', 'never', 'liked', 'actor', 'Bond', 'did', 'like', 'first', 'three', 'Bond', 'films', 'just', 'never', 'actor', 'did', ""n't"", 'much', 'care', 'last', 'Bond', 'film', 'either', 'now', 'once', 'again', 'have', 'good', 'film', 'good', 'actor', 'part', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'hate', 'say', 'Ian', 'Fleming', 'novel', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'was', 'quite', 'possibly', 'weakest', 'Bond', 'novel', 'film', 'novel', 'manages', 'be', 'faithful', 'also', 'making', 'good', 'Apart', 'beginning', 'great', 'action-packed', 'film', 'pretty', 'close', 'novel', 'plot', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'few', 'miner', 'details', 'HAD', 'change', 'times', 'novel', 'was', 'written', 'early', '50s', 'film', 'set', '2006', 'James', 'Bond', 'character', 'much', 'Ian', 'Fleming', 'Bond', 'rather', 'previous', 'film', 'versions', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'most', 'part', 'film', 'action-packed', 'pretty', 'exciting', 'Bond', 'once', 'again', 'meaningful', 'relationship', 'girl', 'last', 'time', 'Bond', 'film', 'tried', 'was', '1969', 'Her', 'Majesty', 'Secret', 'Service', 'only', 'thing', 'hated', 'film', 'was', 'Vesper', 'Bond', 'relationship', 'too', 'damn', 'long', 'anything', 'actually', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'fine', 'cut', 'out', 'scene', 'where', 'Bond', 'Vesper', 'were', 'beach', 'scene', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'boring', 'had', 'just', 'left', 'scene', 'out', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'best', 'Bond', 'film', 'yet.Never', 'less', 'was', 'still', 'great', 'action-packed', 'film.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

Craig's Bond is edgier, reflecting a James Bond who is amoral, aloof, far removed from the values of the average person - which makes him well-suited for killing.Gone for the most part is the techno-wizardy of Q that provided so much of the fun of the Connery films. There's a bit of it: a Sony-Ericcson cell phone plays a small part as does a 1964 Aston-Martin with a surprising array of goodies in the glove compartment.Instead we have a relentless Bond who pursues his quarry without mercy. Bond's ruthlessness and coldness is demonstrated in the opening sequence. His subsequent exchanges with M, flawlessly performed by Judi Dench, hammer home that this Bond is still rough around the edges and his masters appreciate that: they want an automaton who doesn't worry about collateral damage.The requisite willing women fall for this Bond's charm as they have fallen for every Bond.The story is actually a bit of of a muddle, but there's so much action, no one cares.The villains, particulaly Le Chiffre, are as good as Daniel Craig.This is an old-fashioned film in many ways and all the more satisfying for that. No greys here, no nagging questions about morality. There is good - and his name is James Bond. And there is bad - everyone else.

Most of the other Bond's have there one-liners and have fun with their witty lines. Craig has fun with them too but he doesn't deliver them every time he kills a bad guy.

His pace is about as slow as if he's doing a 60's Jamees Bond film. Which is only bad when we get a little too many scenes with Bond playing cards.

Every single one of them, and we're including the ones starring Sean Connery, who's made more out of less (his accent and bristly but cultured masculinity) than any actor I can think of.They all stank, like rot. Until this one.To begin with, it's not poorly lit, poorly shot, with lethargic ""action"" sequences involving cheap explosions and poorly choreographed fight scenes. The lovable institution of ""Q"" (always beware of ""lovable institutions"") has been dispatched entirely, as have cartoonish demonstrations of ""cultured living"" that would appeal only to those with no conception of what ""cultured"" and ""high class"" actually consist of. (Hint: it has nothing to do with ordering drinks shaken and not stirred, or enjoying Peruvian Blonde coffee from the first beans of the season.)James Bond movies have always appealed to a certain demographic. At least in the US, that was predominantly young, male, and incredibly dumb. Female characters--even the allegedly ""strong"" ones--were always soft in the head and punished for any semblance of mental fortitude with unapologetically mysogynistic names like Pussy Galore. (So much for ""strong female characters"", it's no wonder that being a ""Bond Girl"" is an insult to any serious working actor.)Daniel Craig is a wonder--physically compact and powerful, he's like watching a coiled spring move about the stage. Eva Green, however, is the real standout. Her Vesper Lynd falls for none of Bond's pat lines and surface charms, and is just as bright and quick as he is: his initial attempt to establish the alpha-male position in their relationship is quickly upended entirely, with a sharp riposte that set the tone for the rest of the movie.Given this latest turn in the franchise, and its rightful place as The Only Good Bond Movie Ever Made, I wait with no small anticipation for the latest release, Quantum Solace.",4,"Finally, a Bond movie that doesn't suck",1221696000,"09 18, 2008",2008,1939,"['dirty', 'secret', 'when', 'James', 'Bond', 'movies', 'suck', 'single', 'one', ""'re"", 'including', 'ones', 'starring', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'who', 'made', 'more', 'less', 'accent', 'bristly', 'cultured', 'masculinity', 'actor', 'can', 'think', 'stank', 'rot', 'one.To', 'begin', 'not', 'poorly', 'lit', 'poorly', 'shot', 'lethargic', 'action', 'sequences', 'involving', 'cheap', 'explosions', 'poorly', 'choreographed', 'fight', 'scenes', 'lovable', 'institution', 'Q', 'always', 'beware', 'lovable', 'institutions', 'been', 'dispatched', 'entirely', 'have', 'cartoonish', 'demonstrations', 'cultured', 'living', 'would', 'appeal', 'only', 'conception', 'what', 'cultured', 'high', 'class', 'actually', 'consist', 'Hint', 'nothing', 'do', 'ordering', 'drinks', 'shaken', 'not', 'stirred', 'enjoying', 'Peruvian', 'Blonde', 'coffee', 'first', 'beans', 'season', 'James', 'Bond', 'movies', 'have', 'always', 'appealed', 'certain', 'demographic', 'least', 'US', 'was', 'predominantly', 'young', 'male', 'incredibly', 'dumb', 'Female', 'characters', 'even', 'allegedly', 'strong', 'ones', 'were', 'always', 'soft', 'head', 'punished', 'semblance', 'mental', 'fortitude', 'unapologetically', 'mysogynistic', 'names', 'Pussy', 'Galore', 'So', 'much', 'strong', 'female', 'characters', 'wonder', 'being', 'Bond', 'Girl', 'insult', 'serious', 'working', 'actor', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'wonder', 'physically', 'compact', 'powerful', 'watching', 'coiled', 'spring', 'move', 'stage', 'Eva', 'Green', 'however', 'real', 'standout', 'Vesper', 'Lynd', 'none', 'Bond', 'pat', 'lines', 'surface', 'charms', 'just', 'bright', 'quick', 'initial', 'attempt', 'establish', 'alpha-male', 'position', 'relationship', 'quickly', 'upended', 'entirely', 'sharp', 'riposte', 'set', 'tone', 'rest', 'movie.Given', 'latest', 'turn', 'franchise', 'rightful', 'place', 'Only', 'Good', 'Bond', 'Movie', 'Ever', 'Made', 'wait', 'small', 'anticipation', 'latest', 'release', 'Quantum', 'Solace']",N/A

1048370,A246DPGDMYPQ0K,B000MNP2K8,J. Ocampo,"[3, 4]","So many of us are utterly incapable of dissolving our image of the suave yet sophisticated British cavilier known as 007.  The tuxedo-wearing popinjay tantalized beautiful women with confident, yet refined displays of masculine charm, and impressed his male fans with his ownership of the entire gamut of scientific contraptions of every conceivable use.  The framework of this two pronged technique of charm and mechanical know-how was glued together with violence, and thrust into a land of spies, international intrigue, deception and surprise.With such an attractive combination of interest drawing elements, it is not at all shocking that some Bond aficionados are a bit thwarted that the most modern portrayal of the spy genre's most prolific icon has apparently departed from some of the more indispensible traits.The bond we are presented with in Casino Royale is not the same eloquent dandy that we have growned accustomed to.  To call him a brute, and to equate him with the likes of the slope-browed, ill-mannered icons of American 1980's era action, such as Arnold and Stallone, would constitute a full-blown hyperbole.  But the new Bond is suprisingly uncouth, and graceless when compared to his former self.His attitude is not the only change, he has done away with his impecable selection of duds, but has not totally replaced them with a formal dress code of clumsiness.  Though suit is used sporadically, he has not yet donned a pair of torn jeans with an oil stain.  If this is not the Bond you know, then imagine a Bond that has done away with at least half of his stunning staple of mechanical marvels.Before reading any further, I would beg readers to remember, however, that this is the Bond in his early days, before he fully accomplished his 00 status.  Refinement comes with age and experience.  A young Bond does not showcase all of the same character traits as the later edition, but he is Bond nonetheless.He has retained his extraordinary talent for womanizing, though his tactics are a bit different, every gallant nighthawk knows that the verbiage and attitude that attracts the fairer sex is constantly changing over the years.  Similarly, Bond's knack for action is enhanced by the proverbial rocket fuel of youth.  The tireless dynamo possessed every drop of energy that was necessary to revive the modern Bond epic, which has sagged recently.To those who say this is not Bond......A character that is not static, a personality that develops, a life that experiences change is certainly more interesting that a constant, suit donning old chap that churns out the same performances day in and day out.  James Bond, as spotless as he is perceived, was not born in a suit.In addition to the brilliant and gradual development of young Bond, the viewers are immediately treated to a brilliant chase scene, a staple of the Bond genre.  The stunts are well done and choreographed to near perfection throughout, and our protaganist shows a profoud and diverse sense of character.  Energetic, spontaneous, and aggressive, he demonstrates the youthful vigor that a young Bond surely possessed.  His measured violence and ruthlessness add colour to the film and the plot.The film would not be complete without the famous utterance ""Bond, James Bond.""  When it happens, it happens with the young agent clad in a sharp suit.  It acquires more meaning and signifies his gradual growth into the classic Bond.To those who allege that this is no Bond movie, my retort, is that it adds to Bond, it embellishes the legend, it is a peak into his development, it makes it stronger.

The Screen Writers did a great job of updating and adapting the Cold War based novel ""Casino Royale"" to the 21 century.Daniel Craig is a great Bond. Yes, he does not look like what would be considered a normal Bond but his acting makes up for that. He is much more intense than the previous actors who played the character. Some people thought he was not suave enough in this movie. However, these people must understand that EON has restarted the series. Craig is signed on for 3 movies and during these films he will develop more and more into the classic agent we all know. Already by the end of this film he was more Bond-like. Also, the Craig movies will all connect to each other and continue the storyline, unlike the previous Bond movies. EON says they will continue to develop Bond's complex personality.The rest of the cast was superb as well. Mads Mikkelsen played the villain, Le Chiffre. What I liked best about this villain is that he was not over-the-top evil. He was a more realistic ""bad guy"". Eva Green played the Bond girl Vesper Lynd. She is my favorite Bond girl of the 21 films. Her character was much more intriguing and complex than any previous Bond Girls. Craig and her had good chemistry. Judi Dench is M. This is her fifth appearance as M but this time she is not quite the same as in the Bronson films. In Goldeneye, she was the new one on the scene who felt that Bond was a relic of the Cold War. In this film, Bond is the new one on the scene and she is the relic of the Cold War. I liked Jeffrey Wright as Felix Leiter and I hope he is in the next movie.Casino Royale is the longest Bond film to date (Approx. 2 and a half hours) but it keeps a fast pace. The action scenes are some of the grittiest and intense of the 21 films. The stunt work is amazing. EON decided to back away from CGI and the crazy gadgets in favor of a more believable adventure. The director Martin Campbell (Goldeneye) did a great job and I hope he directs the next movie too.I am excited about the 2 disc set. The biggest reason is because the cast really did not promote the movie on the talk show circuit, so I am looking forward to hear what they have to say about the film.Conclusion:I highly recommend Casino Royale.

1048381,AKT8TGIT6VVZ5,B000MNP2K8,John Kwok,"[1, 4]","Director Martin Campbell has done a miraculous, most satisfying, reboot of the James Bond cinematic franchise in directing the stylish, captivating espionage thriller ""Casino Royale"", returning the character of James Bond back to the original character in the Ian Fleming novels, and having, in actor Daniel Craig, the best portrayal of MI 6 agent 007 James Bond since Sean Connery in the films ""Dr. No"", and especially, ""From Russia with Love"". Indeed, this splendid adaptation of ""Casino Royale"" - the third one, and while the others include a wacky 1967 spoof featuring Peter Sellars - it is this one which hews closest to the original text of Ian Fleming's novel, with some concessions to early 21st Century interest in combatting global terrorism. Craig is quite simply the best actor since Connery to play James Bond, offering a twisted, conflicted character who combines recklessness bordering on nearly suicidal behavior with unexpected sentimentality towards the woman he does fall eventually in love with; his portrayal isn't Connery's sophisticated, yet ruthless, espionage agent, or Roger Moore's debonair spy, but nonetheless Craig - a superb actor in his own right - offers a truly convincing, emotionally riveting portrayal of James Bond that suceeds in persuading fans that not only does he deserve this role, but he has also earned the right to continue acting as James Bond.Yet Craig's superb acting isn't the only reason to see ""Casino Royale"". Judi Dench is of course magnificient as a younger version of M, the stern director of MI 6, who finds herself questioning her decision to promote Bond to  00 status. French actress Eva Green is a brainy, beautiful foil to Craig's Bond as British treasury agent Vesper Lynd. Mads Mikkelsen offers an emotionally textured portrayal as the sinister banker - and chief Bond villain - Le Chiffre. Much to my surprise, Jeffrey Wright was also quite convincing as American CIA agent Felix Leiter. The same holds true for distinguished Italian actor Giancarlo Gianinni as Mathis, MI 6's field operative in Montenegro.  Hence ""Casino Royale"" deserves recognition as one of the best films of 2006, as well as of the James Bond franchise, simply due to the overall excellence of its cast.""Casino Royale"" introduces us to the character of James Bond, showing two riveting scenes filmed in black and white at the film's beginning, demonstrating how Bond earned his 00 status, or rather in plain English, his ""licence to kill"". The film's often breathtaking fast pace, takes us from Madagascar to the Bahamas and Florida, as Bond goes in hot pursuit of Le Chiffre's terrorist allies and agents, acting as a lone wolf in nearly complete independence from M and the rest of her senior MI 6 staff.

1048382,A3QJEPBR0GQWFA,B000MNP2K8,John Q Student,"[2, 4]","Oh thank God.  The Bond series has been a sadistic parody of itself for decades, though thankfully, above average instances of parody have typically been followed by a complementary tendency towards seriousness.  Consider Casino Royale to be the restoring pendulum swing of the franchise' most ludricrous logical deviation to date, Die Another Day, a movie that had as much respect for the Bond character as it had for plot, plausibility or ... you get the idea.Very similarly to the films of the Timothy Dalton era, Casino Royale gives  a no-nonsense, uber serious portrayal of Bond, though its main advantage over the prior is that Casino Royale's use of character development permits the audience to understand WHY Bond behaves so darkly.  As a result, it no longer seems arbitrary.  At the same time, Daniel Craig plays the role brilliantly, making the audience really believe that Bond has a soul.  Though I realize this film is meant as a reboot, I could still very easily see the young, jacked, former-SAS Craig Bond evolve into the slighty more seasoned but still all around thug that was the Connery Bond.Most interestingly, however, about this movie, is the relationship that develops between Bond and Vesper Lynd, his liason to the Treasury, or something, which may very well comprise the prototype for all of Bond's future relationships with women.  (Ever wonder why he's so fond of but never dates Moneypenny?)  Lynd really is the perfect partner for Bond.  She's dark, just like him, she's calculated, just like him, and in a battle of misdirection and wit, there's no guarantee who would win.  And yet, on top of all that, she is slightly naive, which seems like a charming compliment to Craig's Bond.  Eva Green has been criticized a little for her portrayal but she acts in an interesting, slightly androgynous way, much like her character.  This unusual portrayal potentially reveals elements of the Bond character as well, though regretably, we'll most likely never know for sure.  Unfortunately, Fleming never wrote a prequel to Casino Royale.In summary, Casino Royale is a good leave-your-brain-slightly-on adventure.",5,I think... I just...

But the poker tornamet scenes are way too long it slows the movie down. Cause it should've focused more on building up this new Bond up & the action you get some decent fight scenes some good action. I love the scene were Le Chiffre's henchies find the body of this big guy that Bond killed it was pretty funny. I liked that Bond was given depth. But they did drag it out with 25 30 minute poker scenes. The torture scene where is well done they think Mathis is a insider but it turns out later that he isn't. I do like how they delt with Vasper she had no choice to betray Bond. Bond finds out who was behind it Mr. White which leads to our next movie which I like better. This was the 1st Bond film to feature Mathis. Daniel Craig was the 1st Bond to be younger that the film series. An origins story was planned after The Roger Moore series but Albert R Broccli rejected it cause he felt audiences weren't intrested in a younger Bond. Craig was Barbra Broccli's 1st choice. In some countries it was released in 2007 which was neat. This is the highest grossing movie in the franchise. Sean Connery was rumored to direct in early production. The Venice sinking sequence took 3 weeks to complete. In 04 while Brosnan was still James Bond he suggested Quintin Tarintino. Pirece Brosnan was considered too old to play Bond. Martin Campbell agreed to direct cause he had no other projects at the time. Longest Bond film so far. It would've costed $30 million to have Pierce Brosnan to return. 1st Bond movie to have Bond leave alone. Martin Campbell I don't know if his heart wasn't in it but he didn't have the same impact from Golden Eye. Daniel Craig gives an alright performance. Judi Dench gave a great perfomance. Eva Green wasn't bad. Mads Mikkenssen didn't get me as the villain. Giancarlo Ginnnini was good.

I must admit, I was a bit disturbed upon hearing Daniel Craig would play the role of Bond.  He was blonde (we had never had a blonde bond before) and didn't really seem to fit the part based on previous works of his that I had seen.  Now after seeing the film, I can safely say he was a great choice and my fears were not necessary.  The film is full of great characters, exotic locations, and everything else that makes a true 007 film.Buying this film on Blu-ray should be a no-brainer considering you have a Blu-ray player.  Myself, I have a Playstation 3 console which according to reviews on the internet and in magazines is the best Blu-ray player on the market.  It played Casino Royale beautifully on my HDTV in 720p and 1080i.  The scenes are full of detail, I even paused the movie on a scene that had a large crowd.

1048398,A2Y3CWITEF9JGY,B000MNP2K8,"JP Salazar ""Web Developer""","[1, 7]","The Cold War is over, but that doesn't mean that there are not new treats to the world. For that reason, the Bond franchise gets a fresh start. The movie is now based on Ian Fleming's first book Casino Royale. This time Daniel Craig gets the role of one of the coolest characters in cinema, James Bond. He has presence on screen and the action is plenty, but the story could have been better.Story:James Bond (Daniel Craig) is the new kid on the block in the MI6 organization led by M (Judi Dench). He gained the 00 status after his two first kills. He is a cold-blooded, reckless and egomaniacal spy. Now as a 00 agent, he is after a villain Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen) who funds terrorist groups around the world. One terrorist attack is stopped by Bond. To cripple his evil activities, Bond follows him to Montenegro where they will play an extravagant game of poker. As Bond travels, he meets his undercover partner, Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) who gets romantically involved with him. Will he be able to stop Le Chiffre? Will Bond break the spy code and fall for Vesper?Review:We all expect--if you are fan of Bond movies--to see cool gadgets, exotic cars, crazy stunts and plenty of beautiful women and you'll see most of those traditional icons in this new film. This time around the gadgets are almost gone to create a more mature, realistic and darker Bond--a beautiful Aston Martin is his car of choice. He is more reckless, egomaniac and careless that the previous 007 (Pierce Brosnan).We like the first half of the film--the classic Bond intro credits is one of the best ones. The photography is excellent and the stunts are probably one if the best we've seen this year--the airport action scene is priceless. Honestly, Daniel Craig was not my first choice as the next Bond--my pick was Clive Owen--but after watching his performance in this new film, he totally changed my mind. He is perfect for the role. He is very athletic, charismatic, but always keeping his cold-blooded and strong personality.Unfortunately the last half of the film is where most of the problems are. The main story becomes secondary, sillier, paper thin and stretched for a movie that is 144 minutes long. The plot is now more about Bond's ego and his game of poker. The editing could have been better--at this point, the movie drags--especially while playing poker. The game resembles a fancy version of the ESPN World Series of Poker TV show. As we are watching Bond playing poker, we realize how silly the whole scene is. How can you bring down someone that is funding terrorists just by taking his money in a game of poker? We ask ourselves. Also during the games, Bond and Vesper get romantic, but we don't feel the connecting between them. Their relationship feels a bit forced and awkward.After waiting for a great finale, we were surprised that the movie doesn't end in a conventional way because the story seems to ""continue"" for the next installment.The Verdict:Casino Royale--even though it has some low points--is much better than the previous movie from the Pierce Brosnan era. No more ridiculous gadgets. This reborn of the franchise feels more mature. We hope to see more of Daniel Craig in his new and exciting new role, but we also hope the next plot to be stronger than this one. For the filmmakers, please make the film a bit shorter next time.",4,The Bond franchise gets a fresh start,1173657600,"03 12, 2007",2007,3348,"['Cold', 'War', ""n't"", 'mean', 'are', 'not', 'new', 'treats', 'world', 'reason', 'Bond', 'franchise', 'fresh', 'start', 'movie', 'now', 'based', 'Ian', 'Fleming', 'first', 'book', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'time', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'role', 'one', 'coolest', 'characters', 'cinema', 'James', 'Bond', 'presence', 'screen', 'action', 'plenty', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better.Story', 'James', 'Bond', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'new', 'kid', 'block', 'MI6', 'organization', 'led', 'M', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'gained', '00', 'status', 'two', 'first', 'kills', 'cold-blooded', 'reckless', 'egomaniacal', 'spy', 'Now', '00', 'agent', 'villain', 'Le', 'Chiffre', 'Mads', 'Mikkelsen', 'who', 'funds', 'terrorist', 'groups', 'world', 'One', 'terrorist', 'attack', 'stopped', 'Bond', 'cripple', 'evil', 'activities', 'Bond', 'Montenegro', 'where', 'will', 'play', 'extravagant', 'game', 'poker', 'Bond', 'travels', 'undercover', 'partner', 'Vesper', 'Lynd', 'Eva', 'Green', 'who', 'romantically', 'involved', 'Will', 'be', 'able', 'stop', 'Le', 'Chiffre', 'Will', 'Bond', 'break', 'spy', 'code', 'fall', 'Vesper', 'Review', 'expect', 'are', 'fan', 'Bond', 'movies', 'see', 'cool', 'gadgets', 'exotic', 'cars', 'crazy', 'stunts', 'plenty', 'beautiful', 'women', ""'ll"", 'see', 'most', 'traditional', 'icons', 'new', 'film', 'time', 'gadgets', 'are', 'almost', 'gone', 'create', 'more', 'mature', 'realistic', 'darker', 'Bond', 'beautiful', 'Aston', 'Martin', 'car', 'choice', 'more', 'reckless', 'egomaniac', 'careless', 'previous', '007', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', '.We', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'classic', 'Bond', 'intro', 'credits', 'one', 'best', 'ones', 'photography', 'excellent', 'stunts', 'are', 'probably', 'one', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year', 'airport', 'action', 'scene', 'priceless', 'Honestly', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'was', 'not', 'first', 'choice', 'next', 'Bond', 'pick', 'was', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'watching', 'performance', 'new', 'film', 'totally', 'changed', 'mind', 'perfect', 'role', 'very', 'athletic', 'charismatic', 'always', 'keeping', 'cold-blooded', 'strong', 'personality.Unfortunately', 'last', 'half', 'film', 'where', 'most', 'problems', 'are', 'main', 'story', 'becomes', 'secondary', 'sillier', 'paper', 'thin', 'stretched', 'movie', '144', 'minutes', 'long', 'plot', 'now', 'more', 'Bond', 'ego', 'game', 'poker', 'editing', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'point', 'movie', 'especially', 'playing', 'poker', 'game', 'fancy', 'version', 'ESPN', 'World', 'Series', 'Poker', 'TV', 'show', 'are', 'watching', 'Bond', 'playing', 'poker', 'realize', 'how', 'silly', 'whole', 'scene', 'How', 'can', 'bring', 'down', 'someone', 'funding', 'terrorists', 'just', 'taking', 'money', 'game', 'poker', 'ask', 'Also', 'games', 'Bond', 'Vesper', 'get', 'romantic', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'connecting', 'relationship', 'bit', 'forced', 'awkward.After', 'waiting', 'great', 'finale', 'were', 'surprised', 'movie', ""n't"", 'end', 'conventional', 'way', 'story', 'continue', 'next', 'installment.The', 'Verdict', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'even', 'low', 'points', 'much', 'better', 'previous', 'movie', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'era', 'more', 'ridiculous', 'gadgets', 'reborn', 'franchise', 'more', 'mature', 'hope', 'see', 'more', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'new', 'exciting', 'new', 'role', 'also', 'hope', 'next', 'plot', 'be', 'stronger', 'one', 'filmmakers', 'please', 'make', 'film', 'bit', 'shorter', 'next', 'time']",N/A
1048399,AVB7IN1VP08RE,B000MNP2K8,"JSR700 ""JSR""","[3, 11]","I have been a long time Bond fan since I can remember. I have read all the novels, seen all the films, and read about Ian Fleming and a lot of articles about the subject. After Ian Fleming's death other authors were hired to write Bond novels namely: Kingsley Amis, Christopher Wood, John Gardner and Raymond Benson.This is actually the second film entitled ""Casino Royale."" The first one was a James Bond spoof that starred David Niven.After all the hype, I must say that the second ""Casino Royale"" is an above average action film (but if you have to see only one action film this year you will be better off with ""The Departed"").Daniel Craig is a good actor. I have seen him in ""Road to Perdition,"" ""The Mother,"" and ""Munich"" among others. However, Craig's Bond is far from Ian Fleming's Bond in the novels and the early Sean Connery films which had Ian Fleming's seal of approval.What's good about Craig's Bond is that it was stripped off a lot of complicated and fantastic plots as well as unrealistic sets that plagued the last Pierce Brosnan film (Although I consider Pierce Brosnan as arguably the best Bond after Sean Connery). The sets of ""Die Another Day"" became too fantastic and distracting from the story and the character build-up. I think its a mistake to let technological advancement and elaborate sets to overcome a film's story and character.A lot of Bond fans complain that Daniel Craig doesn't look a bit like the 007 in the novels. This is accurate in the sense that Bond had dark hair...""with a comma of hair falling over his brow."" In fact, Ian Fleming wrote in his novels ""Casino Royale"" and ""Moonraker"" that James Bond resembled musician-actor Hoagy Carmichael with a scar down one cheek.Also, Daniel Craig's recurring beefcake display was also distracting and unnecessary. As to the costume, the film focused more on Craig's muscle shirts than the traditional impeccable suits, jackets and shirts which traditional British Eaton and Oxford educated chaps, like Bond, normally wear. Ian Fleming was so precise as to write that Bond preferred fine Sea Island cotton for his shirts. Also, James Bond plays Baccarat NOT poker. The writers must have been overly influenced by the recent rash of Vegas style Texas Hold' em on television.Although Craig's acting in the the torture scene highlighted his ability, he lacked the tradmark Bond charm. There was no presence when he walked into the room. He could have been mistaken for the bad guy who get's killed in the first 15 minutes of a Bond flick. Also, Craig's Bond seemed to lack the distinct class and breeding the gentleman MI6 operative was known for. But this might be attributed to the fact that this was supposed to be James Bond's debut in both book and film.Speaking of MI6, the film's MI6 operatives seemed like blundering idiots who do not know what they were doing unlike those in the novel and the previous films. Looking back, the early Ian Fleming novels were written right after World War II & it is unlikely that MI6 would have chosen those types working for British Intelligence (CIA and KGB office and field operatives in ""The Good Shepherd"" were far more credible).Daniel Craig was able to emote the spy's calousness but lacked the depth of facial expression to tell you what was happening to him. I would have preferred Pierce Brosnan's portrayal in this area. He was still good for another Bond film. But if the producers wanted to replace him I would have preferred Clive Owen. But that's just my personal opinion. My opinion might be shaded by my belief in tradition especially when it comes to pop culture male role models. I believe that certain actors are fit to play certain roles which include looks as criteria as shallow as it may sound. Otherwise, I would agree that Daniel Craig will make a better ""Superman"" instead of newcomer Brandon Routh because the former is a better actor.Although, making Bond too hi-tech becomes distracting, this film had so little gadgets that it was not fun anymore (unless you consider Craig's too prominantly displayed Sony Viao as a ""hi-tech"" gadget. This is probably the commercial effect of Sony Pictures' getting this franchise. But much as I love Sony products their after sales service sucks! FYI). A miniature defibrilator in the glove compartment of the Aston Martin was the gadget highlight of the movie. Although, the novels do not emphasize the gadgets, I believe they had their share of secret weapons without going overboard like in ""Moonraker"" (the film not the book) and ""Die Another Day."" Noticeably, ""Q"" is missing.Characterwise, Bond isn't the type who would say ""I love you."" The only time I recall Bond saying those words was in ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" (book and film) to the only woman he ever married - Contessa Teresa ""Tracy"" Di Vicenzo played in the film by the unforgettable Diana Rigg (""The Avengers"") to George Lazenby's Bond. I guess Daniel Craig had to say it to compensate for his inability to emote what the character would have felt at that particular scene. But it could also be that Bond becomes less emotionally attach as he gets older and more experinced. Eva Green, although very beautiful, looked too much like Bond Girl No. 99 Sophie Marceau (""The World is Not Enough"") and unfortunately but understandably lacked the latter's acting experience which is not a whole lot to begin with.Overall, I was a bit disappointed. I heard people (especially women) say it's the best Bond film ever. I respectfully disagree. The novels speak for themselves. ""Casino Royale"" (the second film) although has its entertainment strengths, could not measure up to Sean Connery's ""Dr. No,"" ""From Russia with Love"" and ""Goldfinger"" taking into consideration that most of these films were made in the 60's. Pierce Brosnan's first (""Goldeneye"") was probably the best Bond film after them. Although good acting accolades also go to Timothy Dalton in ""Living Daylights.""Although ""Casino Royale"" was a fresh break from the last tech diluted ""Die Another Day."" I do not think I would like to see more of the same. Althought Craig's ""The world will know you scratched my balls"" dialogue was funny, I will always miss Sean Connery's more ""intelligent"" and ""gentlemanly"" quips. ""...I think he got the point..."" (Connery to Domino after shooting Vargas with a harpoon in ""Thunderball"").",3,After All the Hype,1167696000,"01 2, 2007",2007,6342,"['have', 'been', 'long', 'time', 'Bond', 'fan', 'can', 'remember',

But then for some reason they replaced all the actors except the actress Judi Dench as ""M"", which is slightly confusing.A lot of friends have told me they liked this film because it got back to the roots of James Bond as being a cold brutal killer.The James Bond franchise is similar to Batman in the sense that there is a subset of fans who are always complaining that the character isn't dark enough, and needs to return to his dark brooding roots and away from all his cartoonish gadgets. But, like Batman, the character can just as easily get ridiculous in either direction. As in: ""you know he has a darkside, but you don't know it enough until you see this movie"".I don't think Bond's cold side has ever really been neglected. In most of his films it shows up in some form or another.Even in films like ""The World is not Enough"" there was that scene where Bond remorselessly shot the woman he had slept with.""Casino Royale"" boarders on over-emphasizing Bond's psychopathic nature (I'm thinking primarily of the scenes in the beginning). But on the whole I think it walks the line pretty well, and does faithfully reproduce Ian Fleming's classic line: ""The bitch is dead.""The extended poker scenes also emphasize Bond's cunning side, and give the film a bit of high class Casion glitz.

1048402,A10G4BPT5MGBHY,B000MNP2K8,Julie Neal,"[6, 8]","The Bond franchise starts over with this film, which stars fair-haired Daniel Craig as an inexperienced rookie earning his ""00"" status. The plot? To rid an African terrorist group of its funding, Bond takes on its evil banker in a high-stakes poker game at a Bahamas casino. Along the way he learns discipline, patience, and yes, how to judge a good martini.In fact, though the film has a definite modern feel, it contains many classic 007 touches. Though he starts off in a Ford, Bond soon finds himself driving a vintage Aston Martin, and later gets to wreck a brand-new one. When he tells his assistant (Eva Green) her secret identity, he jokes that ""you are now known as 'Miss Stephanie Broadchest'"" (""I am not!"" she protests). And yes, guys, there's eye candy -- a bikini-clad babe once pops out of the sea, while another bounces down the beach as she rides a horse -- both for no apparent reason whatsoever.Trouble is, none of this is especially memorable. The girls are rarely seductive, and few and far between. The movie is based on Ian Fleming's 1953 novel, but the plot has been reworked to focus on the redial capability of cell phones, a mundane story device if there ever was one. The chase scenes are creative enough but offer little spectacular scenery. And though it's interrupted a couple of times, the poker game drags on for a full 32 minutes, with nary a bouncy babe in sight. In fact, the whole movie is way too long, especially the final third.Actually, my favorite part of the film is its gorgeous title sequence, which combines the art of  playing cards and roulette wheels with graphic silhouettes of Bond and his enemies. And I really like Judi Dench, reprising her role as the long-suffering M. Also good are two 25-minute bonus features. ""Becoming Bond"" recounts Craig's selection and preparation for the role with lots of behind the scenes footage, while ""James Bond: For Real"" shows how many of the stunts used a surprisingly little amount of CGI.In the end, this is a good popcorn movie, but it won't be a classic. Craig's youth and solid acting make him a fine choice for the new Bond, but he needs a better writer -- and editor -- to become the next Sean Connery.",3,Can Bond be blond?,1179273600,"05 16, 2007",2007,2197,"['Bond', 'franchise', 'film', 'fair-haired', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'inexperienced', 'rookie', 'earning', '00', 'status', 'plot', 'rid', 'African', 'terrorist', 'group', 'funding', 'Bond', 'evil', 'banker', 'high-stakes', 'poker', 'game', 'Bahamas', 'casino', 'way', 'discipline', 'patience', 'yes', 'how', 'judge', 'good', 'martini.In', 'fact', 'film', 'definite', 'modern', 'feel', 'many', 'classic', '007', 'touches', 'off', 'Ford', 'Bond', 'soon', 'driving', 'vintage', 'Aston', 'Martin', 'later', 'wreck', 'brand-new', 'one', 'When', 'assistant', 'Eva', 'Green', 'secret', 'identity', 'are', 'now', 'known', ""'Miss"", 'Stephanie', 'Broadchest', 'am', 'not', 'yes', 'guys', 'eye', 'candy', 'bikini-clad', 'babe', 'once', 'sea', 'bounces', 'down', 'beach', 'horse', 'apparent', 'reason', 'whatsoever.Trouble', 'none', 'especially', 'memorable', 'girls', 'are', 'rarely', 'seductive', 'few', 'far', 'movie', 'based', 'Ian', 'Fleming', '1953', 'novel', 'plot', 'been', 'reworked', 'focus', 'redial', 'capability', 'cell', 'phones', 'mundane', 'story', 'device', 'ever', 'was', 'one', 'chase', 'scenes', 'are', 'creative', 'enough', 'offer', 'little', 'spectacular', 'scenery', 'interrupted', 'couple', 'times', 'poker', 'game', 'full', '32', 'minutes', 'bouncy', 'babe', 'sight', 'fact', 'whole', 'movie', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'especially', 'final', 'third.Actually', 'favorite', 'part', 'film', 'gorgeous', 'title', 'sequence', 'art', 'playing', 'cards', 'roulette', 'wheels', 'graphic', 'silhouettes', 'Bond', 'enemies', 'really', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'reprising', 'role', 'long-suffering', 'M.', 'Also', 'good', 'are', 'two', '25-minute', 'bonus', 'features', 'Becoming', 'Bond', 'Craig', 'selection', 'preparation', 'role', 'lots', 'scenes', 'footage', 'James', 'Bond', 'Real', 'how', 'many', 'stunts', 'used', 'surprisingly', 'little', 'amount', 'CGI.In', 'end', 'good', 'popcorn', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'classic', 'Craig', 'youth', 'solid', 'acting', 'make', 'fine', 'choice', 'new', 'Bond', 'better', 'writer', 'editor', 'become', 'next', 'Sean', 'Connery']",N/A

Although I was a bit disappointed in the way that Pierce Brosnan was unceremoniously dumped, I have to say, it appears that Daniel Craig was certainly up to the task and has already proven himself a worthy successor.Although the story is a bit predictable and it does drag in a few places, the adaptation of the very first Bond novel is quite entertaining. There are some insightful moments that really let you delve a bit into Bond characters (such as why he tends to somewhat, umm, objectify women over the years) However, there are plenty of great Bond action sequences. There is an extraordinary chase scene early on in the movie that really helps it get off with a bang.It seems with this movie that the studio was initially going for a test run with Daniel Craig at the helm of Bond. However, what very well could have would up being a medicore movie wound up become a stellar one with solid performances given all around. Cheers to everyone involved in the making of this film.This film achieves all it sets out to as it will surely catapult Daniel Craig's name into the mainstream;s collective conscious and build high anticipation for future installments to come.Video: 4/5Audio: 4.5/5Video and audio are both superb. One of the best Blu-Ray releases I have seen so far from both a video and an audio standpoint. Highly reccomended. A great technical showpiece early in the Blu-Ray's life-cycle. The video was vibrant and certainly a noticeable upgrade from standard defintion. While there are a few blu-ray titles out there sporting better visuals, Casino Royale is by my no means lacking in this department. 1080p is, with the case of blu-ray, once again a given.The uncompressed 5.1 PCM sound track does a wonderful job of bringing every gunshot, grunt, and groan to our ears. The aural component of this film is very much a winner and will surely make you the envy of anyone whom you present this film to (especially if they know little about hi def video/audio)Extras: 2.5/5We all know that MGM knows how to make a film proper, so how about learning how to give a solid slate of extras along with the film. Is it really that much to ask for? The extras are sorely lacking and the absence of a commentary in this day and age is simply unexcusable. Hopefully, they'll learn to clean up their act.Final Verdict: Buy it.While a double dip of this film is imminent (see: every other re-hashed Bond film), if you can look past the sore lack of extras, this disk delivers everything else in spades.

1048404,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B000MNP2K8,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[3, 6]","Have you ever wondered what events helped make James Bond into the man we have known for the last few decades?  Ever wanted to know how he achieved his `00' status or why he treats women the way that he does?  Well, if you do then you will no doubt want to watch the movie that is being called `the best Bond movie ever made'.  The movie I'm talking about of course is ""007: Casino Royale"".  After over 20 movies, the producers of the `James Bond' series felt it was time for a restart, a way to make Bond fresh for today's audiences.  So, what better way to do that than to begin this reboot of the franchise with the story that started it all, and let audiences everywhere discover just how James became Bond.""007: Casino Royale"" begins with a different kind of James Bond (Daniel Craig), as we are first introduced to him at a point in his career where he doesn't even have his `00' status as yet.  However, it doesn't take Bond long to achieve this level after he succeeds in assassinating two enemy agents in quick order, and the timing couldn't be better.  It turns out while James is becoming agent 007, a terrorist financier known as Le Chiffre is gambling heavily with his client's money.  It's a risky move for sure when playing with other people's money, especially when those people are terrorists, but it's a move that has paid off time and again with very lucrative profits.  But when Le Chiffre gambles his most recent client's money on the stock market and loses, he quickly realizes that in order to survive he will have to pay back the money in short order before the terrorists notice that their money is missing.  To accomplish this, Le Chiffre has organized a high-stakes poker tournament, and one he is confident that he will win.  That is until `M' (Judi Dench) the head of MI-6 assigns 007, who just so happens to be their best poker player, with the task of defeating Le Chiffre so that he will have no where to run except to the British government for sanctuary from the very terrorists that he used to work for.  To ensure that all goes smoothly, `M' has placed a Treasury agent named Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) to watch over James, but when they begin to fall for each other Le Chiffre sees this as an opportunity to stop Bond once and for all.After more than 20 movies have utilized the character of `007', and 5 actors had previously played the part, it's hard to believe that MGM would want to just start over as if all that had never happened.  Especially if they expect audiences to go along with them on this little endeavor, and I'm sure the fact that the previous `Bond' movie ""007: Die Another Day"" being the most successful `007' film to date didn't make the decision any easier.  But as difficult as it was to understand MGM's reasoning, and as much skepticism regarding the casting of the first blonde James Bond, after viewing the movie I have to say all my skepticism, along with everyone else's was all for naught, and that MGM had made a very good choice.""007: Casino Royale"" is by far one of the best `James Bond' movies ever to be made, if not the absolute best.  The story for the movie was the most realistic of any `Bond' movie, and also had so much ground to cover, that it's surprising the movie didn't feel cluttered with the amount of groundwork that was laid for the already established franchise, but the writers delivered brilliantly.  One terrific choice, and yet was also one that was panned in the beginning, was the lack of gadgets that were to be included in this `Bond' movie, opting to go with a more realistic approach, and this decision proved to elevate the movie above its predecessors.  Assisting in making this movie become so terrific was the directing by Martin Campbell (""The Mask of Zorro""), who delivers an even better, more polished movie than his last foray into the world of James Bond when he launched Pierce Brosnan's career as MI-6's most famous agent in ""007: Goldeneye"", and proving that he was the right man to bring James Bond back to reality.  As far as the actor chosen to portray agent 007, Daniel Craig was superb, though panned by fans and critics as not looking the part, after the movie was finished I believe almost everyone is in agreement that he is one of the best Bond's ever in the franchise's history.  Craig's performance shows audiences a much more gritty, battle-hardened agent who will do what it takes to get the job done, while at the same time he can show a vulnerability that hadn't been seen before in these movies as a Bond that makes mistakes and sometimes loses.  It was nice to see Judi Dench return as `M', though for continuity this doesn't work since she didn't become `M' until the Pierce Brosnan movies, but that is a fact that can easily be overlooked, much like the various actors playing the title role.  Rounding out the main cast of characters is Eva Green as Vesper Lynd, the newest Bond girl, who James falls in love with only to have his heart torn apart, delivering him his most valuable lesson:  Trust no one.Regardless of all the skepticism and nay-saying that surrounded this relaunch of Hollywood's most enduring franchise, in the end ""007: Casino Royale"" had the last word, proving to audiences and critics to never underestimate the man known as ""Bond, James Bond"".""007: Casino Royale"" is rated PG-13 for violence and sensuality.",5,Discover How James Became

1048417,A27CHILBK6HIL2,B000MNP2K8,Kaya Savas,"[4, 9]","MOVIE: The James Bond franchise is the most successful series of films in cinema history. So, when it was announced that Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson were looking to revamp the franchise there were some areas of concern. The biggest shocker to hit the film industry was that Pierce Brosnan was out and that it was time for a new Bond. Rumors began circling like crazy. Actors like Clive Owen, Hugh Jackman, and a dozen more were rumored to be the next actor to fill the role. When Daniel Craig was announced as the official Bond a roar of opposition came from fans all over. There was even a ""Craig Is Not Bond"" website that started a petition to get the producers to change their minds. It was a sad and humiliating exhibition on the part of the fans, to make judgements based solely on the actor's previous works and different looks from the other Bonds. I mean honestly, who thought Tobey McGuire was going to be Spider-Man, that Christian Bale was going to be the new Batman, and a bunch of other iconic roles. The fact here is that Daniel Craig makes an excellent Bond.Casino Royale was the first book written by Ian Fleming, and it introduced the world to James Bond. After a decade of inconsistent and so-so Bond films it was decided that character needed to return to his roots, back to the basics. Bond films started to become nothing but mere parodies of themselves. Die Another Day was the biggest sign that a few changes needed to be made. The last great Bond film was GoldenEye so it was logical to call back director Martin Campbell to direct Casino Royale. Another big thing to note about this film is that Paul Haggis was brought on board to do some rewrites, to solidify the script and fully develop the characters. Past Bond films had such laughably bad dialogue that the witty puns the series made famous became poorly executed and just shameful. The plots got so over the top even for Bond films. Die Another Day featured a giant laser, an ice palace, a bi-racial bad guy, and some thug with diamonds in his face. With Casino Royale we go back to the basics of Bond yet we still retain the class and themes that make Bond what he is.The film's opening sequence is the shortest of all the films (not counting Dr. No since it did not have one). We see that James Bond has just been promoted to double-0 status, we then cut directly into the amazing main titles. Chris Cornell delivers a very Bondesque song with David Arnold arranging the classy orchestral sound mixed in with Cornell's style. The title song is called ""You Know My Name"", and the titles are highly stylized animatics that use the poker theme of the film. The plot is simple, a terrorist banker decides to raise money to fund a terrorist cell by winning a high stakes poker game at the Casino Royale in Montenegro. Bond is assigned to win the game thus crippling Le Chiffre and the cell. Things go wrong mostly from the mistakes that Bond makes, which is brilliant. This is Bond as a beginner, so he makes plenty of bad choices. In the first action scene, a thrilling foot chase through a construction site, we see Bond stumbling and struggling to catch up with the fugitive. The scene is absolutely amazing and is really the most amazing foot chase I have ever seen on film. Other amazing action sequences include a rundown at the Miami Airport, a staircase fight with a machete wielding crime lord, a shootout in a collapsing building, and just as tense are the poker scenes. I was reluctant of the choice to drop the game of Baccarat and replace it with Texas Hold 'Em, but it was an appropriate choice considering that times have changed. Poker definitely worked and the games are incredibly tense.Another aspect of this installment is that it is notably more violent than the other Bond films. We also see more blood than we have scene in Bond films before this. In the novel there is a really graphic torture scene and I was wondering how they were going to handle it. They toned it down, but it still will make the men in the theater cringe and thanks to Paul Haggis' touchups he inserted the film's funniest line in the torture scene, which worked perfectly. The violence adds an intensity that really elevates the film and makes it a worthy adaptation since the novel itself was really dark.While the film has its questionable changes they are all for the better. For one, Judi Dench is M even though Bernard Lee plays the role in the original films up till GoldenEye. There is also talk of ""post 9/11"" even though the original films stay in their time period of when they were made. If the next Bond film attempts to continue the idea of this new Bond then it will be a big mistake. The next film has to return hitting the ground running as if it were the same old Bond. Even so, this is an incredible action film and an incredible Bond film. Casino Royale is an amazing and is equal to the quality of the Connery days. It is also one of the best action films ever made in my opinion.ACTING: Daniel Craig is a brilliant Bond and that is all there is to it. The character is quiet as he comes to terms with his environment, we feel that he is out of his element and is slowly molding into the James Bond that we have come to love and know over the past 45 years. Daniel Craig molds the perfect Bond to show guts and arrogance that end up teaching him lessons about how to handle the profession. James Bond doesn't become Bond until the very end of the film and that is enhanced by David Arnold's score. He uses the theme that was established in the main title song, but not once do we hear the James Bond theme. We only hear the theme at the very end when James becomes Bond. Any doubts that Craig was a poor choice should be thrown out, and people who doubted him before with such a passion should bite their tongue and take the shame of being horribly wrong. In terms of supporting roles we have Eva Green, Madds Mikkelson as the villain, and Jeffrey Wright as Felix. Eva Green is the perfect female lead in the film, and you really can't call her a ""Bond Girl"". She has a presence you can respect and she is not just there as eye candy and a toy for Bond. Madds Mikkelson makes the perfect Le Chiffre, a Bond villain that of course has a some sort of physical distinction like every Bond villain should have. The roles are well written and for the first time we see some real pathos in the Bond franchise.BOTTOM LINE: Casino Royale is genuinely thrilling and works on every level, truly a Bond film that stacks up with the best in the franchise. Daniel Craig will wow you as Bond and I guarantee you'll have a blast at the movies whether you've seen every Bond film before this or you are completely new to it.",5,"Casino Royale Is Genuinely

1048418,AYPS4RCXEFSJP,B000MNP2K8,K. Boullosa,"[2, 5]","This is the first Bond movie since ""You Only Live Twice"" (the last of Connery's ""good"" Bond movies) that didn't bore me witless - I basically threw in the towel after that one.  The producers and writers hit on exactly the right strategy here: showing Bond on the way up, still a bit raw, and displaying an edge of savagery that gives his choice of career some context.  Craig hits the right note bang on the nose: edgy, his cocky self-assurance actually a drawback rather than an asset to his job, still learning the ropes, and complicated.  And, despite performing the usual complement of nonsensical physical feats, he manages to remain human.  The difference between Craig's Bond and Connery's Bond is that Craig is playing an extraordinary man, while Connery was playing a ridiculously unreal one.  Connery, through sheer intelligence and physical magnetism, brought the unreal man to some sort of life; Craig brings the extraordinary man to life.  The Bonds in between don't count, and that includes Pierce Brosnan.  There are no other Sean Connerys - his was a unique persona in a unique physical package.  Trying to find another one was a pointless exercise.  Craig, by contrast, is not remotely handsome, but he's very hot, a product not of the arrangement of his features but of his controlled intensity, conveyed in the first black and white fight scenes of the movie.  Although there are plenty of Pretty People onscreen, it was a relief not to be hit over the head with an endless parade of also ridiculously unreal women falling into Bond's arms like clockwork.  The plot actually held some interest on its own, and the required action scenes were - well, just as they should be.The rest of the cast is also fine, including the Danish actor Mads Mikkelson as the villain. My one complaint is that the sound was a bit problematic.  I often lost the second halves of sentences.  This was particularly true of Eva Green, who appeared to be trying to pitch her voice to a very low and throaty timbre.  The result was that half the time I couldn't understand what she was saying.

I'm Kind Of A ...","[5, 10]","My grandfather is a gigantic James Bond fan, he has seen every film, knows which bonds fit the bond role and which ones don't. After 20 films and forcing me to watch them all for most of the beginning of my life he thinks Daniel Craig was a good pick to carry the Bond torch. I agree with my grandfather because Craig kills this role and makes a great first impression with his first Bond film. Casino Royale, which many may already know, was the first novel of the Bond series from the 007 creator Ian Fleming. It is also the first Bond film since The Living Daylights to take its name from a Flemming Novel.The film starts with a no license Bond and it's not his driver's license. James must kill 2 people before he can receive the double-0 and a license to kill. James sets out on his first mission as a 007 after completing 2 kills, which takes him to the world's terrorist banker Le Chiffre who is a very nasty man with a scarred face that has a huge addiction to gamble. In order to stop Chiffre James must beat him in a poker game, which certainly isn't cheap to stop the terrorists network. He is given some help from who else but his first Bond girl Vesper Lynd played by Eva Green but can she give him the help he really needs to stay alive.This film is very crisp; everything is perfect from the cinematography to the writing and pacing. A problem I always had with the James Bond films was that they seemed too long with prolonged over the top action scenes. On some occasions I might have had to watch a James Bond film twice to get everything that happened. I am surely not trying to knock the series cause the films were great but they also had flaws. I don't think that Daniel Craig is the best Bond though he was good but he lucked up by getting a great writing team and director that had fresh ideas and made significant changes.Having Martin Campbell directing was a great idea because he did a great job with GoldenEye but still brought some fresh ideas to this film. The action was perfect because it was very believable and Craig did well with his choreography and stunts. I feel that the film needed to focus a little more on the hand-to-hand fighting scenes than excessive mobile chases with gadgets going crazy blowing everything to bits.On the acting side of the film I think they did a good job casting. I wasn't a real big fan of Eva Green in Kingdom of Heaven but she did an ok job in this film. This was an overall great film because it was very realistic and believable. It took the good from all of the Bond movies before it and added more good to it than bad plus Daniel Craig is a good successor to Pierce Brosnan. He has set a high bar for himself and is expected to only get better in the upcoming Bond22 set to release in 2008.",5,Who Knew It Would Be This Good,1174435200,"03 21, 2007",2007,2764,"['grandfather', 'gigantic', 'James', 'Bond', 'fan', 'seen', 'film', 'bonds', 'fit', 'bond', 'role', 'ones', 'do', ""n't"", '20', 'films', 'forcing', 'watch', 'most', 'beginning', 'life', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'was', 'good', 'pick', 'carry', 'Bond', 'torch', 'agree', 'grandfather', 'Craig', 'role', 'great', 'first', 'impression', 'first', 'Bond', 'film', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'many', 'may', 'already', 'know', 'was', 'first', 'novel', 'Bond', 'series', '007', 'creator', 'Ian', 'Fleming', 'also', 'first', 'Bond', 'film', 'Living', 'Daylights', 'take', 'name', 'Flemming', 'Novel.The', 'film', 'license', 'Bond', 'not', 'driver', 'license', 'James', 'must', 'kill', '2', 'people', 'can', 'receive', 'double-0', 'license', 'kill', 'James', 'out', 'first', 'mission', '007', 'completing', '2', 'kills', 'world', 'terrorist', 'banker', 'Le', 'Chiffre', 'who', 'very', 'nasty', 'man', 'scarred', 'face', 'huge', 'addiction', 'gamble', 'order', 'stop', 'Chiffre', 'James', 'must', 'beat', 'poker', 'game', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'cheap', 'stop', 'terrorists', 'network', 'given', 'help', 'who', 'else', 'first', 'Bond', 'girl', 'Vesper', 'Lynd', 'played', 'Eva', 'Green', 'can', 'give', 'help', 'really', 'stay', 'alive.This', 'film', 'very', 'crisp', 'everything', 'perfect', 'cinematography', 'writing', 'pacing', 'problem', 'always', 'had', 'James', 'Bond', 'films', 'was', 'seemed', 'too', 'long', 'prolonged', 'top', 'action', 'scenes', 'occasions', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'watch', 'James', 'Bond', 'film', 'twice', 'get', 'everything', 'happened', 'am', 'surely', 'not', 'trying', 'knock', 'series', 'cause', 'films', 'were', 'great', 'also', 'had', 'flaws', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'best', 'Bond', 'was', 'good', 'lucked', 'up', 'getting', 'great', 'writing', 'team', 'director', 'had', 'fresh', 'ideas', 'made', 'significant', 'changes.Having', 'Martin', 'Campbell', 'directing', 'was', 'great', 'idea', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'GoldenEye', 'still', 'brought', 'fresh', 'ideas', 'film', 'action', 'was', 'perfect', 'was', 'very', 'believable', 'Craig', 'did', 'well', 'choreography', 'stunts', 'feel', 'film', 'needed', 'focus', 'little', 'more', 'hand-to-hand', 'fighting', 'scenes', 'excessive', 'mobile', 'chases', 'gadgets', 'going', 'crazy', 'blowing', 'everything', 'bits.On', 'acting', 'side', 'film', 'think', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'casting', 'was', ""n't"", 'real', 'big', 'fan', 'Eva', 'Green', 'Kingdom', 'Heaven', 'did', 'ok', 'job', 'film', 'was', 'overall', 'great', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'realistic', 'believable', 'took', 'good', 'Bond', 'movies', 'added', 'more', 'good', 'bad', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'good', 'successor', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'set', 'high', 'bar', 'expected', 'only', 'get', 'better', 'upcoming', 'Bond22', 'set', 'release', '2008']",N/A

I say this because the film did not seem like a James Bond film.  All the normal conventions were missing: no issue of the call from M, no Q, no Miss Moneypenny.  I'm not sure how they could even call this a Bond film.I think they were self-aware of the reboot, so they overcompensated by trying to too hard to make it a Bond film--the gunbarrel, the exquisite opening credits, retro swimsuit, the two Aston Martins, one a retro-Bond, the martini joke, the tux, and the self-aware Ms. Broadchest.  However, they merely depicted the external Bond. So what we saw were merely recycled props.  This is an action spy thriller, not Sotheby's.And then there's the plot.  Plot is usually defined as a story's meaningful series of events. We got the series of events, but there was no meaning to them. It seemed like splice job of well-choreographed actions and romance scenes.  The plot twists jerked in large clumps.  But I was not sure where I was going in the film--once again, this did not follow the pattern of the first 21 Bond films.And then there were the thick accents of the two leads. They sounded very romantic, but only Rupert Giles could understand them. Furthermore, you had the odd attempts at making Bond more human, with cockiness covering self doubt with a dash of angst--is this Bond or Bourne?. And mercy! to have Bond screaming under torture! After to years with the Chinese, Bauer kept his peace.  Sigh!As a consolation prize, I have seen that they have begun to reprint Fleming's clasics--albeit with rather racy covers.

This one was quite different, more in line with the true character in Fleming's novels than a well-dressed clown spouting one-liners to negate the comedic violence.  I know the producers chose this direction because they wanted to distance themselves from the goofy Austin Powers films which were nothing more than a parody of earlier Bond films... which had already become parodies of themselves!God, how I hated that.You see, the James Bond novels played a very large part in my growth and desire to be a writer.  My father introduced me to them when I was twelve years old and I devoured them.  I'm very picky, therefore, about my Bond actors and the movies themselves.  This one did not disappoint me.The producers of Casino Royale also had the good sense to realize the actor playing James Bond is only as good as the villain he faces.  Le Chiffre was a sadistic bastard in the novel and he's played that way here, too.  And anyone who's ever read the novel will be gripping throughout the movie because they know what's coming later in the film. Again, Royale doesn't disappoint, nor with the love interest between Bond and Vesper, (Bond's first and really only love until me met Tracy) along with its inevitable conclusion.The novel itself is somewhat famous for its last line.  Mickey Spillane copied something like it for his Mike Hammer novel, I, the Jury.) The line appears here in the film, though not at the very end which lessens its impact.  It's still powerful, however, played against the backdrop of a crumbling building as metaphor for Bond's life.All in all, a very good film.

I actually think Daniel Craig did a fine job as Bond.  At this point in the franchise, we have come to expect roles to change every so often.  I will let the other reviews stand on their own as far as that goes.  It all goes back to the original argument that there was no other Bond after Sean Connery.  That's subjective.  I was born & raised on Roger Moore, while my parents had Sean...and we all like Pierce Brosnan, so it's up to the viewer to decide if the actor is right or wrong.  Personally, I say it's the character we're here to see.The aspect I DON'T like about this adaptation of ""Casino Royale"" is we are led to believe this is pre-007 Bond, but we have modern cell phones, references to 9/11 and, the most annoying part of all, the current incarnation of ""M"".  The filmmakers readily admit they HAD to get someone younger to play Bond as this is supposed to be the beginning of the series....BUT in the same breath say there was no one else they could see playing ""M"" except Judi Dench who didn't assume the role until 1995!  Come on, now.  Judi does a fine job in the role as one would expect, but I cannot get past the fact that they didn't recast for this film.  This is why I am rating it a ""3"" instead of a ""5"".  Technically, the film, discs & packagaging are what we'd expect.It seems confusing to expect us to believe this is the originial story about Bond with so many liberties taken on continuity....BUT if we didn't suspend disbelief, we wouldn't love this franchise as much as we do!  Is this 1957 or 2006?  They seem to be wanting US to decide the timeline with regards to the other films/stories.  Having said that, this is an action-packed film that stands out from the rest of the series because it focuses more on the emotional development of James Bond, not his cache of gadgets.

Each have their take on the role. But, rarely to you get the cold, hard and dangerous killer from the novels. The first Connery Dr. No, has Bond with no Q or gadgets, floating naked silhouettes and less wordplay than later films that better fit what we've come to expect from a movie Bond. When these 'Trademarks' are missing some purists become disgruntled. Royale does what could have been done when Brosnan took over, start over with the original novel and the first adventure with Bond. Overdue due to rights issues, one of the best, rawest 007 tales has never been done (seriously) to date (the '67 spoof and '54 American TV movie not considered canon). What better place to invent Bond, without reinventing him at all.Daniel Craig has the rugged look of a... dare I say it... a ""Connery Bond"", more man than model, although he took alot of grief over his hair color. But Craig is the who can utter all the original lines, even the icy closing line of the original novel (ck it out). Dame Judi Dench is so brilliant as M I'm not bothered by the continuity problems of her becoming her own predecessor. Another notable changes to the original, is that Casino Royale's game of choice is now Texas Hold 'em instead of Baccarat, which is cool considering the book was written in '53, swapping a current game the same way that Bond movies swapped post WW II for post Cold War.The story for the uninitiated is roughly the same, a newly upgraded British intelligence operative is assigned to track a band of international terrorist. The plan is to break up the band by breaking the Banker...Le Chiffre, who compulsively gambles with the groups funds. Bond, aided by hot Treasury agent Vesper Lynd, is to play and beat him at poker, forcing him to seek goverment protection from his understandably irrate ex-clients (in exchange for their secrets).In addition to Eva Green as the first ""Bond Girl"", we get to see Bond's first Tux, his first Aston Martin, but probably not his first Martini.As I said this one is raw, gritty and refreshingly free of the gimmicky gadgets and supervillian plots, away from the larger than life Bond pic of the past and more firmly set in the real world than ever before (sort of).This is a solid new direction for the Bond films I can't wait for more.",5,The book BOND is back!,1163721600,"11 17, 2006",2006,2409,"['Everyone', 'gon', 'love', 'Bond', 'grew', 'up', 'literally', 'figuratively', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'Connery', 'Moore', 'have', 'take', 'role', 'rarely', 'get', 'cold', 'hard', 'dangerous', 'killer', 'novels', 'first', 'Connery', 'Dr.', 'No', 'Bond', 'Q', 'gadgets', 'floating', 'naked', 'silhouettes', 'less', 'wordplay', 'later', 'films', 'better', 'fit', 'what', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'movie', 'Bond', 'When', ""'Trademarks"", 'are', 'missing', 'purists', 'become', 'disgruntled', 'Royale', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'when', 'Brosnan', 'took', 'over', 'start', 'original', 'novel', 'first', 'adventure', 'Bond', 'Overdue', 'due', 'rights', 'issues', 'one', 'best', 'rawest', '007', 'tales', 'never', 'been', 'done', 'seriously', 'date', ""'67"", 'spoof', ""'54"", 'American', 'TV', 'movie', 'not', 'considered', 'canon', 'What', 'better', 'place', 'invent', 'Bond', 'reinventing', 'all.Daniel', 'Craig', 'rugged', 'look', 'dare', 'say', 'Connery', 'Bond', 'more', 'man', 'model', 'took', 'alot', 'grief', 'hair', 'color', 'Craig', 'who', 'can', 'utter', 'original', 'lines', 'even', 'icy', 'closing', 'line', 'original', 'novel', 'ck', 'out', 'Dame', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'so', 'brilliant', 'M', ""'m"", 'not', 'bothered', 'continuity', 'problems', 'becoming', 'own', 'predecessor', 'notable', 'changes', 'original', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'game', 'choice', 'now', 'Texas', 'Hold', 'instead', 'Baccarat', 'cool', 'considering', 'book', 'was', 'written', ""'53"", 'swapping', 'current', 'game', 'same', 'way', 'Bond', 'movies', 'swapped', 'post', 'WW', 'II', 'post', 'Cold', 'War.The', 'story', 'uninitiated', 'roughly', 'same', 'newly', 'upgraded', 'British', 'intelligence', 'operative', 'assigned', 'track', 'band', 'international', 'terrorist', 'plan', 'break', 'up', 'band', 'breaking', 'Banker', 'Le', 'Chiffre', 'who', 'compulsively', 'groups', 'funds', 'Bond', 'aided', 'hot', 'Treasury', 'agent', 'Vesper', 'Lynd', 'play', 'beat', 'poker', 'forcing', 'seek', 'goverment', 'protection', 'understandably', 'irrate', 'ex-clients', 'exchange', 'secrets', '.In', 'addition', 'Eva', 'Green', 'first', 'Bond', 'Girl', 'get', 'see', 'Bond', 'first', 'Tux', 'first', 'Aston', 'Martin', 'probably', 'not', 'first', 'Martini.As', 'said', 'one', 'raw', 'gritty', 'refreshingly', 'free', 'gimmicky', 'gadgets', 'supervillian', 'plots', 'away', 'larger', 'life', 'Bond', 'pic', 'past', 'more', 'firmly', 'set', 'real', 'world', 'ever', 'sort', '.This', 'solid', 'new', 'direction', 'Bond', 'films', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'more']",N/A

He must have wanted to put his best foot forward here and show Matthew Vaughan or whoever that there's life in the old dog yet.  But this baby races.  The long card game in Montenegro, that apparently lasts nearly 24 hours (with breaks for sex and murder), is briskly staged and comes studded with its own surprises, including the ""reveal"" about who Jeffrey Wright is supposed to be playing!  He seemed more than ordinarily interested in Daniel Craig from the beginning, but I thought he was supposed to be an aesthetic Hilton Als type, drawn to beauty like a moth drawn towarda a flame, and then you find out---(SPOILERS ENSUE)He's Felix Leiter, Bond's soon to be BFF!  Hats off to EON for casting such a great actor in what doesn't come to much here, but if he is kept will eventually bloom into a honey of a part.  It's like having Veruschka in the casino.  They don't have to make a great deal of it, they've got so much front line talent that great faces can just appear and disappear, alluring shadows.  What Eisenstein called the Cinema of Attractions.I thought it was a little over the top when Le Chiffre tore the entire cane seat out of the chair when it was time to torture Bond's underparts.  That was a huge hole and any other man would have fallen right through.  The hole ideally should have been somewhat less than the entire breadth of the chair seat?  And when Craig is strapped into it he seems to be perched as though there were no hole at all.  That's how great his body is, I assume.OK, should the producers have hired Eva Green when they had the chance to cast Angelina Jolie as Vesper Lynd?  Maybe Jolie was asking too much.  Or maybe the idea was that, everyone would know that Vesper had a dark side if you had AJ playing the part right from the start?  Maybe that's so, but it takes a while to get used to Eva Green and when Bond orders to look luscious for the casino scene, and she comes down in Morticia Addams' old hair and makeup, I knew right away she had sabotage in mind.{SPOILERS END.)All in all, a great shakeup for a beloved series.

1048431,AATS9Q7VJ4PFI,B000MNP2K8,Kevin R. Austra,"[5, 7]","Overall a great back to basics James Bond film.  In addition to Daniel Craig taking on the role of Bond, the film greatly limits computer generated special effects and we are presented with a slightly more mean spirited and almost humorless bond.Daniel Craig is a significant change to the Bond character.  In CASINO ROYALE he is more like Charles Bronson's character in THE MECHANIC or Clint Eastwood in PALE RIDER.  Missing are the largely humerous quips and self assured posturing at casino tables.  Craig's portrayal of Bond is probably closer to Sean Connery's original Bond in DOCTOR NO.  CASINO ROYALE'S bond freely uses his semi-automatic pistol.  Previous Bonds, following FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE, always seemed to lose their pistols at the outset of a fight.  In all honesty it will probably take two or three films to get used to Daniel Craig as Bond.Gone too are the humorous foils with no sign of John Cleese or any reincarnation of ""Q.""  Judi Dench returns as ""M.""  Dench already established her character in prior Bond films as a no-nonsense administrator.  As such, there is very little difference in Dench's portrayal of ""M"" in CASINO ROYALE.In ROYALE we are treated to an alterante Bond universe in that the film is about Bond's first mission, set in the current era, as a double-O agent.  As such we find an arrogant and self-confident Bond whose foibles often lead to learning curve hubris.  He is not the automatic winner-takes-all at the gaming table and allows his emotions to lead him astray on several occasions.  In fact he initially comes off as the bad boy of the double-O's.The action sequences in this movie are more akin to Bruce Willis in the DIE HARD movies, albeit with additional stamina.  Yes, there are the trade mark fast cars, beaches, millionaire resorts and casinos that most of us can only dream about.  What would Bond be without jetsetting?The movie's only drawback is that it becomes unnecessarily complicated.  When I saw the film for the first time I felt as if I needed to have a line and block diagram to tie together all of the inserted characters, relationships and locations.  At the conclusion of the picture I was not sure what victory had been won for Queen and country.  Still, this is a good outing for a re-tooled Bond.  Hopefully future films will keep to this back to basics theme and stay away from stories with ice palaces, underground megaplexes, and gray-suited masterminds who have it all, but want more.",4,Bond Remastered,1182643200,"06 24, 2007",2007,2467,"['Overall', 'great', 'back', 'basics', 'James', 'Bond', 'film', 'addition', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'taking', 'role', 'Bond', 'film', 'greatly', 'computer', 'generated', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'presented', 'slightly', 'more', 'mean', 'spirited', 'almost', 'humorless', 'bond.Daniel', 'Craig', 'significant', 'change', 'Bond', 'character', 'CASINO', 'ROYALE', 'more', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'character', 'THE', 'MECHANIC', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'PALE', 'RIDER', 'Missing', 'are', 'largely', 'humerous', 'quips', 'assured', 'posturing', 'casino', 'tables', 'Craig', 'portrayal', 'Bond', 'probably', 'closer', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'original', 'Bond', 'DOCTOR', 'NO', 'CASINO', 'ROYALE', 'bond', 'freely', 'semi-automatic', 'pistol', 'Previous', 'Bonds', 'following', 'FROM', 'RUSSIA', 'WITH', 'LOVE', 'always', 'seemed', 'lose', 'pistols', 'outset', 'fight', 'honesty', 'will', 'probably', 'take', 'two', 'three', 'films', 'get', 'used', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'Bond.Gone', 'too', 'are', 'humorous', 'foils', 'sign', 'John', 'Cleese', 'reincarnation', 'Q', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'M.', 'Dench', 'already', 'established', 'character', 'prior', 'Bond', 'films', 'no-nonsense', 'administrator', 'such', 'very', 'little', 'difference', 'Dench', 'portrayal', 'M', 'CASINO', 'ROYALE.In', 'ROYALE', 'are', 'treated', 'alterante', 'Bond', 'universe', 'film', 'Bond', 'first', 'mission', 'set', 'current', 'era', 'double-O', 'agent', 'such', 'find', 'arrogant', 'self-confident', 'Bond', 'foibles', 'often', 'lead', 'learning', 'curve', 'hubris', 'not', 'automatic', 'winner-takes-all', 'gaming', 'table', 'emotions', 'lead', 'astray', 'several', 'occasions', 'fact', 'initially', 'off', 'bad', 'boy', ""double-O's.The"", 'action', 'sequences', 'movie', 'are', 'more', 'akin', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'DIE', 'HARD', 'movies', 'additional', 'stamina', 'Yes', 'are', 'trade', 'mark', 'fast', 'cars', 'beaches', 'millionaire', 'resorts', 'casinos', 'most', 'can', 'only', 'dream', 'about', 'What', 'would', 'Bond', 'be', 'jetsetting', 'movie', 'only', 'drawback', 'unnecessarily', 'complicated', 'When', 'saw', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'felt', 'needed', 'have', 'line', 'block', 'diagram', 'tie', 'together', 'inserted', 'characters', 'relationships', 'locations', 'conclusion', 'picture', 'was', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'victory', 'had', 'been', 'won', 'Queen', 'country', 'Still', 'good', 'outing', 're-tooled', 'Bond', 'Hopefully', 'future', 'films', 'will', 'keep', 'back', 'basics', 'theme', 'stay', 'away', 'stories', 'ice', 'palaces', 'underground', 'megaplexes', 'gray-suited', 'masterminds', 'who', 'have', 'want', 'more']",N/A

1048434,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000MNP2K8,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[132, 160]","I like James Bond as much as the next guy. I've read a couple of Ian Fleming's novels, have seen all the films (many in the theater), and have all the box set DVDs. I don't consider myself obsessive, however, Bond to me has always been a bit of a lark--adrenaline style entertainment. From the serious Bond to the cheesy Bond, there's always some action or outrageousness to admire. So I was mystified when so many people were absolutely indignant that Daniel Craig was signed for the role. I'm not saying I supported the ouster of Brosnan, I'm just saying I was pleased that a talented actor was taking his place. And the idea of rebooting the series wasn't controversial to me, but an ingenious way to reinvigorate the franchise.Now having seen ""Casino Royale,"" I stand firm in my opinion that Craig makes an excellent 007 (even though he's blonde and not Clive Owen). He demonstrates a real brashness as the newly promoted Bond--defiant, cocky and tough as nails. But the character has many shadings which Craig pulls off effortlessly. The flirtatious womanizer, the tender romantic, the brutal killer, and the betrayed lover are all well played and believable. He inhabits Bond with a realness, a personality--it's more than the casual quip, there's something going on in his brain. But maybe Craig's strongest asset is his physicality. Not only has he given Bond emotional resonance, but his physical presence make his action scenes and tough guy performance much more realistic.The movie's plot is somewhat superfluous to me--it's a pretty standard setup. The film kicks off with a tremendously staged chase, however. The stunts and choreography are excellent--it's exciting when necessary and amusing where appropriate. You know instantly that you're in for a thrill ride. As we settle in for the main story, Bond meets with Vesper Lynd--played by Eva Green. Green is a good match for Craig, and her character is written well--their relationship can be surprisingly sweet. The major plot point revolves around a poker game which Bond must win. Within this card game, an interesting psychological contest is developed with the villain. I liked the blend of action and cunning gameplay.The third act for me, while necessary to the development of Bond's character, did play on a little long and held no real surprises. But that said, it was particularly well acted. Overall, I found the Bond reboot amazingly successful. Craig makes Bond human again and ruthless, too. Recommended as a solid action picture, and one of the stronger entries in the series!

Casino Royale is changing all that and reinvigorating what had become a flagging franchise. What we need is a Bond who is ruthless. We need a Bond who bleeds. We need a Bond who spends less time looking pretty and more time taking care of business. Enter Daniel Craig. Check. Check. And Check.With the introduction of Daniel Craig as Bond, we have entered  new era in the Bond franchise. These films have finally given us something to be afraid of--terrorism--and given us a hero who will not countenance our fear--he'll do something about it.

Both of us hoped that one day the rights to Casino Royale could be bought and the book brought to the big screen. When Daniel Craig got the role I was horrified. I thought he was too short, too ugly and too blonde to pull it off. Well, I am delighted to say that I was wrong. After five minutes I forgot about the hair and remembered that Ian Flemming didn't describe Bond as being a handsome man but as a rugged looking one. Daniel Craig must have studied Sean Connery because he reminded me more of Connery than any of the latter Bonds. He's not soft like Brosnan, and he's not fooling around like Moore sometimes seemed to be, and he's not clearly overwhelmed like Dalton. He is extremely physical, tough looking and has that emotional coolness that Connery showed so well.The plot is tight and remarkably faithful with a few needed updates to the original book. The gadgets are still here of course but they don't dominate the story like they did in the Brosnan years (Remember the invisible car?). The most amazing piece of equipment is 007, himself.This is young Bond's first 00 mission and he makes mistakes and isn't bothered about being subtle. His relationship with Vesper was well done and the actress playing the part looks like the character is described in the book. I'm glad the producers decided to keep the torture scene pretty much as Flemming wrote it. Later instead of taking pills and leaving a sad little note Vesper gets a much more dramatic death in the movie and when Craig says the  big line, ""the b---- is dead,"" you can really see his heart freezing over.The audience I saw the movie with oohed, awed, laughed and cheered at all the right moments. Casino Royale  was a fan's dream come true. Congrats to Craig. He pulled it off.

This is not the rather campy tongue-in-cheek 007 that has too often stolen the show in the Bond franchise; this is a truly ruthless Bond that is true to creator Ian Fleming's vision of the character and the world he lives in.  Daniel Craig steps right into some of the biggest shoes in the fictional world and makes the role his own from the first dead-on shot to the last.  Craig's lean, hungry look captures the essence of Fleming's master spy perfectly.  The dark, noir-ish prologue sets a dangerous tone that holds firm throug the remainder of the film, which delivers all the intrigue, action, romance and globe-trotting excitement that Bond films are famous for but with a decidedly sharper and deadlier edge.  There is no Q-branch here, with its plethora of fantastic gadgets, and while there is humor it's understated and flows naturally from the all-too-human characters and the plot itself.  The action scenes are physical and punishing, the love scenes intense but never gratuitous, the sets true-to-life and the direction from Martin Campbell precise and dextrous.  Mads Mikkelson is a perfect Le Chiffre, possibly even more menacing than the source novel's version, and Jeffrey Wright's new interpretation of Felix Leiter rings true. But it is Eva Green's stunning portrayal of the enigmatic Vesper Lynd that is perhaps the most haunting of the whole film.  Green's Vesper is beautiful, witty, and intelligent, but unreadable and somehow tainted with a hidden wound that makes her ultimately untouchable as well.  There hasn't been a Bond girl like this since Diana Rigg's immortal turn as Tracy from ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE way back when.  And Craig's last line is the perfect end-note for a breathtaking thrill-ride and brilliant re-imagining of one of cinema's most enduring yet frequently mishandled characters.  No doubt many long-time fans of the movie series, ignorant of the original source novels, were a little disappointed with this return to Bond's deadlier roots, but the result is one of the three best Bond films ever.  Only DR. NO and the aforementioned ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE, both likewise notable for their more realistic versions of 007 and his creator's vision, are comparable in any way to the new CASINO ROYALE.

1048439,AGKPTMTR3UX1R,B000MNP2K8,"Konrei ""Everything I need is right here""","[5, 9]","This third incarnation of CASINO ROYALE (Barry Nelson in 1954, Woody Allen in 1968, and now Daniel Craig in 2006) is as close to Ian Fleming's literary James Bond as we are likely to get. CASINO ROYALE catapults the Bond franchise all the way back to the gritty realism of 1963's FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE, almost completely excising the many sedimentary layers of spoof, goof, and woof-woof laid on by Eon Productions over the years (Daniel Craig is known as the star of the cult classic LAYER CAKE, and here's another one, but perhaps not to everybody's taste).The now-habitual Bondian overreliance on gadgets is almost all gone, but so, sadly, are Samantha Bond as Moneypenny and John Cleese as Q. Dame Judi Dench reprises M. Monty Norman's electrifying ""James Bond Theme"" barely makes it into the film, and the theme song is utterly unmemorable. However, on the plus side, the forced dialogue that has passed for wit since the Roger Moore days is nonexistent; true Bond style has made a thoroughgoing comeback.Unfortunately, the first third of CASINO ROYALE consists of a very predictable set-piece high explosive battle that lacks any clear connection to the rest of the story, and is hard to follow, to boot. It's nothing we haven't seen before, and Daniel Craig lacks the dark solidity of Connery or Brosnan in carrying off the du jour action sequences.Truth to be told, I turned CASINO ROYALE off at just about the point where Bond reaches Casino Royale. Fortunately, I did turn it back on. I say ""fortunately"" because the second and third thirds of this movie are so vastly different from its beginning that CASINO ROYALE might as well be two different pictures. It's as though Eon elected to draw in the usual methamphetamine audience to feed them the usual tripe, but then said, ""Oh, the hell with it,"" and decided to actually make a Bond FILM for the first time since who-knows-when...Bond is sent to destroy LeChiffre, financier to the world's terrorists, who has compulsively gambled away hundreds of millions of dirty dollars, and is trying to recoup his losses at the ultra-high-stakes poker table of the fabulous Casino Royale. Most of the action takes place around the green baize table, and is undeniably tense in its understatement. Better than an atomic bomb, the real fate of the world rests on a turn of the cards. In that sense, CASINO ROYALE is a true throwback of a film, eschewing the Jerry Bruckheimer Formulary of modern filmmaking. This is a story non plus ultra.Let us introduce James Bond, a spare, angular, wiry blond man who gets battered a lot by some really nasty villains and bleeds (profusely) on his ruffled tuxedo shirts. He suffers a horrific, if prosaic torture session at the hands of his adversary, more personal than any laser beam, and far more effective. Let us introduce James Bond, a man who has just received his ""00"" status and still has some qualms about killing (the bizarre torquing of ""James Bond Universe Time"" that occurs in the series by granting Bond his Double-O circa 2006 is disconcerting, but ultimately unimportant to the franchise). Let us introduce James Bond, a ""blunt instrument"" who must learn to hone himself rapier sharp in order to survive, is betrayed, drinks poison, falls in love, and rejoices over ""the bit**'s"" death, but without the omniscience usually granted by his cinematic stewards. This Bond has character development. In other words, let us introduce Ian Fleming's Bond of the novels finally brought to life onscreen.CASINO ROYALE walks quietly and confidently away from it's first hour to deliver a nuanced and intelligent spy movie. Viewers seeking the usual shopworn Bond formula WILL be disappointed. Even on its own terms, CASINO ROYALE has weak spots (mostly in places where the producers veered from Fleming's taut storyline), and Daniel Craig (though he does turn in a fine performance) is definitely not Everybody's James Bond. Still, I have to rate his interpretation of the Bond character below Connery's, but (surprisingly enough) better than almost anybody else's. Eva Green as Vesper Lynd is exotic and unattainable.In short, CASINO ROYALE is a very creditable THREE AND A HALF STAR EFFORT that suffers from its early adolescent angst, wanting to live down to the Bond Formula, but soon, and blessedly, maturing while we look on.",4,"""Shaken or stirred?

The set decoration by Simon Wakefield (who has worked on Bond films since ""The World Is Not Enough"") is brilliant!

This is the best Bond film I have seen since the days of Sean Connery and this is one of the year's best! This is an brilliant, emotionally-charged action-packed thriller that keeps you entertained and wanting more. Yes, it is overlong, but, to me, I don't really care, once you get caught up in the movie.

1048445,A356RFKNIG043B,B000MNP2K8,K. Swanson,"[3, 4]","Nothing like a dozen product placements every five minutes to remind you that SONY made this film. Talk about killing any feel of reality...which is ironic, as that's what this movie was going for: more reality and less spoofing.And at that, it does pretty well. Sadly, Bond's sense of humor has been all but excised, which makes him barely Bond, in my opinion. As a fan of the books first, Connery's Bond second, and all the other Bonds way down the list, I appreciated the emphasis on less gadgets but did miss the wryness that Fleming and Terence Young brought to the character. Young defined the cinematic Bond first and best, and while this movie aims to redefine him, it barely touches the elan, wit and smoothness that made the early Bonds, and Fleming's Bond, so special.I like Craig more here than in Quantum, but I still think he lacks the dry humor and stresslessness that makes Bond. I'd take him over Moore, Dalton, etc any day, though. The balls out scene shows some humor, but is so dark as to be ridiculous. Nice try, though.And sorry, but there are so many weak Hollywood moments here. For instance, when they have the first beefcake shot of Craig as he walks out of the sea, his hair is all washed back. In the next shot, after the girl swoons at the sight of him, he is still in the same spot...but his hair is now magically and strategically plastered over his forehead. That's a bad continuity man on set, and a bad editor after, and just bad filmmaking, period. Face it, he's going bald...give him a wig a la Connery, or just let him keep his laughable Tom Sawyer haircut and be done with it.Savile Row suits at two grand a pop...and a six dollar Supercuts hairdo? Come on.It's stuff like that, and the nonstop Sony logo on every product, that makes this film cheesy after a while...plus, it's 30 minutes too long, I didn't buy the romance (Bond swooning?), and the poker scenes are horrible. Any decent poker player has to laugh at how badly set up those hands are. Last guy goes all in with a non-nut flush on a paired board where the other three players are calling the turn? Not likely he'd last that long playing that badly. Etc. Terence Young would have cut that in two seconds.But, this Bond is more about selling Sony and a sense of ""reality""...and in the end, that's what makes it real enough to be boring after 90 minutes. I've seen this a few times now and each time it seems to get looonger.But hey, I'm gonna go buy something Sony.

1048446,A1ODZ7SDUPEGNK,B000MNP2K8,"Kurt Harding ""bon vivant""","[4, 7]","If there were ever any doubts as to the suitability of the selection of Daniel Craig as the new James Bond then those doubts should vanish instantly after seeing Casino Royale. I like Craig. He LOOKS like a professional assassin and plays the part to the hilt. I think that he is the best Bond since Sean Connery.I won't rehash the entire plot of the movie, it has a pretty standard theme. That is: On behalf of Her Majesty's Government, James Bond fights a shadowy organization headed by an elusive, ruthless, sinister, and enigmatic boss out to control the world.You will find Casino Royale to be action-packed and immensely satisfying. Many of the stunts are breath-taking and often performed by the actors themselves. And though the story is 50 years old, the technology is modern. No need for the futuristic gadgets of the Connery years. The future is now! And the villains are no longer the Soviets and their lackeys, but instead are international terrorists and those who bankroll them. Of course, action takes place in many exotic locales, the most picturesque of which is Montenegro. Then there are the Bond women, beautiful and sultry as ever.In addition to Craig, I also enjoyed other the other main characters especially the mysterious Solange played by Italian actress Caterina Murino. The only question I had at the end was who Mr White was and where he fit in after Le Chiffre was eliminated. That is, besides the obvious fact that he was the one who ended up with the briefcase containing Her Majesty's Government's money.The action, the quality of the filming, the stunts, and the acting itself all combine to make Casino Royale a movie I'll watch many times. The only aspect of the package that annoys me is having to skip though the previews of other movies that precede the film. That annoyance is more than mitigated, though, by the bonus disc. The stories on how the new James Bond was chosen, the stunts and how they were done, and especially the piece on Bond Girls through the years add much value and make this special-edition package a real bargain.If you are a Bond fan and haven't seen this yet, get it.

I never saw ""Goldfinger"" in the theater and I want to say that I saw ""From Russia with Love"" first, but it could have been ""Thunderball.""  I do know that from ""Thunderball"" on I saw all of the Bond movies in the theater through ""For Your Eyes Only,"" after which I just waited for them to come out on DVD.  I did that with ""Casino Royale,"" the 21st Bond film, but on the basis of what I see here I thin I will have to see the next offering in the theater.Whether you want to call this ""retooling"" or ""rebooting"" a character, what the producers did by casting Daniel Craig as the sixth James Bond and making him grittier and more realistic was a risky proposition.  I still think of Sean Connery as THE James Bond and while I greatly preferred Pierce Brosnan's comic take on the character to that of Roger Moore, the Bond that I thought was headed in the right direction after Connery was Timothy Dalton, who had the hard edge that was missing since the original.  In retrospect you can see Brosnan as being a combination of (or compromise between) Moore and Dalton, but with Craig they are really stripping down the character.  The opportunity was provided by the producers getting the rights back to ""Casino Royale,"" the first of the James Bond novels which had been made into a television drama on CBS in 1954 and then a comic romp anticipating Austin Powers in 1967 with David Niven and Woody Allen.  But the idea that this is the ""first"" James Bond movie, because this is where he gets his double-oh status.The adaptation by the team of Neal Purvis and Robert Wade (""The World is Not Enough,"" ""Die Another Die""), and Paul Haggis (""Million Dollar Baby,"" ""Crash""), updates the novel but keeps to the main plot.  Originally Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen) was a SMERSH agent running a baccarat game at a French casino to raise the money he lost in a failed attempt to establish a chain of brothels.  Bond is assigned to beat Le Chiffre because he is an expert baccarat player so that SMERSH will kill him.  Now the game is Texas hold 'em poker (which today everybody knows, whereas baccarat still confuses me), and the money was lost in a stock manipulation scheme thwarted by Bond.  They kept Judi Dench as M, which is a no-brainer as far as I am concerned because the tension between her and Bond is even stronger this time around, but we never see Q (the comic relief of John Cleese would not fit the film's tone) and M's assistant is now male (Tobias Menzies) instead of Miss Moneypenny.  There are still the sexual innuendos, but they come across now as serious attempts at seduction rather than as lines designed to get a laugh in the theater. Like the character, these bon mots now have an edge to them (e.g., the line about not giving a damn if his martini is shaken or stirred gets a laugh when you see the trailer, but not in the context of the film itself).Supposedly the decision to have the grittier Bond came before the casting of Craig, whose work in ""Road to Perdition"" and ""Munich"" made it clear he could do it (check out his work in ""Infamous"" as well).  This ""Casino Royale"" is an action film and this Bond does not waste a lot of time talking (the eyes have it), although the largest segment of the movie is spent playing high stakes poker.  That is sandwiched between the two key action sequences, which are the ""free running"" chase through a construction sight in the first act that ends up as a gun fight in a foreign embassy, and the big fight in a rapidly sinking building in Venice.  In between there is a nice minimalist knife fight, the attempt to stop a bomber and what is apparently a world record for clipping a car.I had to stop and think about what the action sequences were, because it is the fireworks between Bond and Vesper Lynd (Eva Green), the HM Treasury agent who is financing his seat at the poker table, that are most memorable (even if it takes an hour for her to show up).  When they first meet and she deflects his verbal sparring, he looks her up and down and reads her like a book.  But the fun part is when she does the same to him.  The idea is not so much to come up with the ideal woman for James Bond or for him to finally meet his match as it were, but rather to explain (if not justify) the character's infamous treatment of women.  I was pretty sure I knew where this relationship was headed, but they did go one twist father than I anticipated, which was a nice touch and another way in which this film succeeded in exceeding my heighten expectations.  I especially liked the torture scene because it played to my belief that if the torturer does not break you then they are the one that will end up dead for failing to break you.The extras are decent enough, although I was sort of expecting more given they are all on the second disc in the set.  ""Becoming Bond"" goes through the story of how Craig go the role, although after seeing the film you have to laugh at those who scoffed at his choice.  ""James Bond: For Real"" looks at decision to do all of the stunts ""for real"" as opposed to relying on super toys and computers.  Then there is ""Bond Girls Are Forever: A Closer Look at Bond's Leading Ladies,"" hosted by Maryam d'Abo (""The Living Daylights""), which talks to most of the them and reminds us why Ursula Andress and Honor Blackman are still at the top of the list (bonus points for considering Dame Judi a Bond Girl too).",5,Meet the new Bond.

1048465,A3VLAZEPO9UJEA,B000MNP2K8,L. E. Cantrell,"[2, 3]","This is the 195th review of the ""Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition (2006)"" of ""Casino Royale.""  I have just looked over the previous 194 reviews.  The great majority of them praise this movie to the skies.  Most adhere to one form or another of the ""Best Since Connery"" mantra.  Some wild-eyed radicals are even breaking through all the barricades to proclaim Daniel Craig the best Bond ever.I would guess that 180 or more reviewers approach this latest Bond feature entirely as a film in a series of films.  The underlying basis of their criticism, whether favorable to or revolted by the current ""Casino Royale,"" rests on the joint creation of producer Albert R. (Cubby) Broccoli, directors such as Terrence Young and Guy Hamilton, and, of course, Sean Connery.  To these people, the long-ago contributions of an obscure individual named Fleming hover somewhere between invisible and irrelevant.The tiny remainder of reviewers trot out the memory of Fleming, but mostly to declare that ""Casino Royale"" is a faithful reproduction of his novel of the same name.  By ""faithful,"" it is evident they mean on the one hand that the plot of the movie is  roughly congruent to that of the book and, on the other hand, they mean the new Bond is not decked out with all manner of gaudy, deadly toys, fripperies and gimcracks.  Only Mr. William R. Hancock, about a hundred reviews back, and one annotator amid the comments even further away, offer convincing evidence that they have read more than a couple of pages of Fleming's writings in all their lives.This new Bond, Daniel Craig, is very much a Bond for the Twenty-first Century.  He is the man of the people that many men of the people like to imagine themselves to be--one many women of the people would simply like to like: straightforward, tough, competent ... hard in any of several senses: a demotic Bond.Fleming's Bond was different.  Fleming's operative was no man of the Twenty-first Century, and barely one of the Twentieth.  His Bond was partly Sidney Reilly, who operated against the Germany of the Kaiser and the Russia of the Bolsheviks.  The greater part of Bond, though, was a romanticized, idealized ... Ian Fleming.Fleming was educated at Eton, Sandhurst, Munich University and the University of Geneva.  In 1939 he was recruited by the Director of Intelligence for the Royal Navy.  By the end of the war, he had risen to the rank of commander.  In 1941, American General William Donovan asked him to write a memo detailing the operations of an intelligence and operations service.  Parts of that memo were incorporated into the Charter of the OSS.  Fleming enjoyed telling an anecdote in which he stumbled upon an Axis paymaster gambling in some neutral location.  It had struck him that it would be a very useful thing to bankrupt the man at the tables, thus opening him up to control by British intelligence.  Even more,  he enjoyed admitting that he had gone broke in just three hands while trying to carry out his hare-brained scheme.After the war, he took up the time-honored profession of washed up, highly educated, gentleman spies.  He wrote potboilers for money.  He remembered the name of a fellow member of his London club, one Blofeld, just as he remembered that Axis paymaster at the gambling table.In his first novel, ""Casino Royale,"" Fleming created an operative who held the rank of commander in the Royal Navy.  Commander Bond was a member of an exclusive London gentleman's club.  During the war years, while he had been busy assassinating Axis agents in New York and other exotic locales, he had stored away his beloved Bentley, which he now drove at excessive speed over English roads.  He was a gentleman, defined in his mind as a man who never harms anyone--unintentionally.  Commander Bond, like Fleming, was a frightful snob.  He had very specific, even finicky ideas on proper behavior, gamesmanship (not always legal ones), brand named merchandise, and the correct mixing of drinks.Now, compare Fleming's Bond with the Craig's demotic model.  That Bond's no commander in any man's navy.  If he has a military background, it's as an ""other ranks"" SAS man.  That Bond in a London club?  As a dishwasher, perhaps.  That Bond, a graduate of Eton, polished in foreign universities?  Hardly--a year at a red brick school, maybe, and a desultory go with the Open University, at most.Take the dinner jacket that Bond wears in the big gambling scene.  It's brand new and fits him perfectly.  Fleming, like his friend Noel Coward,  really wore the things on a regular basis.  They wore cuts slightly out of fashion and slightly but exquisitely baggy and threadbare.  They owned the things, you see, and took pains to preserve them, so as not to be taken for freshly-tailored, nouveau riche bounders.  Craig could pass for the bouncer at a slightly seedy gambling den.""Casino Royale"" is actually a pretty good movie.  It is true not so much to the book, but to the  500-word summary undoubtedly given to writers who had evidently never heard of it or read it.  The movie is noticeably less faithful to Fleming's written words than ""Dr. No"" and  ""Goldfinger"" but still more so than most of the films in the Bond series.  (Montenegro, Monte Carlo, who knows?  Who cares?  Baccarat, what's that?)  For all that, however, the heart and soul of this movie is not Fleming's novel but the recent success of ""Batman Begins.""  And at the climactic moment, Craig should not announce that he is ""Bond ... James Bond,"" but, ""Bourne ... James Bourne.""DVD STUFF:I have noticed that people look askance at Amazon reviews that deal with the movies rather than their DVD releases.  Keeping that firmly in mind, I confidently report that ""Casino Royale - Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition (2006)"" comes on a couple of pieces of plastic.

1048466,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B000MNP2K8,Lee Armstrong,"[2, 5]","""Casino Royale"" is a good film.  The two DVD set is an excellent one.  I enjoyed learning about how Fleming's book had been tangled in legalities and was unable to be made until now.  I also enjoyed the clips of watching interviews with many of the women including Halle Berry and Maude Adams who have been ""Bond girls.""  ""Casino Royale"" was even nominated as Best Picture by Oklahoma Film Critics Circle Awards.  Five won Best Sound from the British Academy Awards for the film.Daniel Craig came onto my radar screen inLayer Cake (Widescreen Special Edition)as well as a smaller role inThe Jacket.  He played a doctor with Nicole Kidman in ""The Invasion"" and will star again with her in ""The Golden Compass.""  As James Bond, he brings an intelligence and intensity to the character.  The scene where he drinks a poison and must run to the car and avoid cardiac arrest was intense and gave a sense of reality, even to this Bond movie.  I felt like Craig's Bond established a relationship with Vesper that made the film's conclusion memorable.  The British Academy Awards honored Craig with a Best Actor nomination for this film.Eva Green who was in ""The Kingdom of Heaven"" and with Craig in ""The Golden Compass"" plays Vesper Lynd, a treasury official trying to manage the government's investment in the high stakes poker match.  She won the Orange Rising Star Award in 2006 from the British Academy Awards.  She passes well as the highly intelligent woman.  The plot does have her move into the damsel in distress role during several hacking scenes in the hotel.As the DVD explains, the scenes set in Madagascar were actually shot in the Bahamas.  Sebastien Foucan whose exploits as a free runner bounding over British rooftops plays Mollaka who initiates one of the first chases complete with sky high footraces on a construction crane.  Simon Abkarian plays the Bahamian poor loser Dimitrios who lasts all the way to Miami.  His girlfriend Solange is played well by Italian beauty Caterina Murino.  Mads Mikkelsen who was inKing Arthur - The Director's Cut (Widescreen Edition)plays the chief villain LeChiffre.  His cold ruthless calculation and the blood that drips from his eye make him a chilling villain.  The torture scene where a naked Bond is flogged by LeChiffre was extremely intense and well played by Craig.Judi Dench with her six Oscar nominations and her trophy as Best Supporting Actress from ""Shakespeare in Love"" in 1998 plays M with an intelligence and intensity that fits Craig well.  Giancarlo Giannini who was nominated for an Oscar back in 1977 for ""Pasqualino Settebellezze"" plays the double-dealing ally Mathis.  Jeffrey Wright who won both an Emmy and Golden Globe for ""Angels in America"" in 2003 plays the American CIA agent who is not so good at poker and stakes Bond when Vesper shies away.  Steven Obanno is a rebel leader who follows LeChiffre to the hotel.  He is played with an edgy performance by Ivory Coast actor Isaach De Bankole.""Casino Royale"" is an excellent Bond for the new century.  It's not as gadget happy and stands on its own as a strong spy film.  Along with the bonus DVD, this is an excellent package.

Sean Connery was suave, he was, *is*, James Bond.  Roger Moore was a gentleman with an amazing humor, while Pierce Brosnan was one handsome guy who carried himself well, and even Timothy Dalton had something about him that gave him dignity.  Daniel Craig has not shown any of those qualities.  There is nothing about him that screams ""for Queen and country!""In addition, Eva Green, who was great in Kingdom of Heaven, is given weak lines and a bad role.  A shame, really...The dialogues-oh my- the dialogues are beyond words...M is simply pathetic; a highly hysterical and annoying elderly woman.Q is nowhere to be seen.Finally, the amount of brutality is unprecedented for a Bond film.  Kill away and smack around as much as your heart desires, but do not include the extreme type of torture scenes that this movie had.The positive aspect of the ""movie"" is the setting/location, with the scenery being great!So it's a weak plot, a great setting and a relatively good cast, which when put together fail to take off.",2,Mediocrity,1175472000,"04 2, 2007",2007,1412,"['Casino', 'Royale', 'was', 'quite', 'disappointment', 'considering', 'long', 'tradition', 'excellent', 'Bond', 'movies.The', 'acting', 'pretty', 'good', 'nothing', 'great', 'plot', 'below', 'average', 'dialogues/lines', 'are', 'way', 'below', 'average', 'then', 'great', 'locations/scenery', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'disappoints', 'role', '007', 'rough', 'edges', 'lacking', 'something', 'others', 'had', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'was', 'suave', 'was', '*is*', 'James', 'Bond', 'Roger', 'Moore', 'was', 'gentleman', 'amazing', 'humor', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'was', 'one', 'handsome', 'guy', 'who', 'carried', 'well', 'even', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'had', 'something', 'gave', 'dignity', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'not', 'shown', 'qualities', 'nothing', 'Queen', 'country', 'addition', 'Eva', 'Green', 'who', 'was', 'great', 'Kingdom', 'Heaven', 'given', 'weak', 'lines', 'bad', 'role', 'shame', 'really', 'dialogues-oh', 'my-', 'dialogues', 'are', 'words', 'M', 'simply', 'pathetic', 'highly', 'hysterical', 'annoying', 'elderly', 'woman.Q', 'nowhere', 'be', 'seen.Finally', 'amount', 'brutality', 'unprecedented', 'Bond', 'film', 'Kill', 'away', 'smack', 'around', 'as', 'much', 'heart', 'do', 'not', 'include', 'extreme', 'type', 'torture', 'scenes', 'movie', 'positive', 'aspect', 'movie', 'setting/location', 'scenery', 'being', 'great', 'weak', 'plot', 'great', 'setting', 'relatively', 'good', 'cast', 'when', 'put', 'together', 'fail', 'take', 'off']",N/A

""M"" (Judi Dench), head of the British Secret Service, sends the newly-promoted 007 on his first mission that takes him to Madagascar, the Bahamas and eventually leads him to Montenegro to face Le Chiffre, a ruthless financier under threat from his terrorist clientele, who is attempting to restore his funds in a high-stakes poker game at the Casino Royale.

I enjoyed the movie, a different take on how Bond will be protrayed will always be welcome compared to the old formula that do get bit old. Daniel Craig proves to be a strange actor to played James Bond but if you are going to reboot the entire series, you might as well take a totally different formula, you might as well start with a totally different Bond. Blond, stocky and rugged looking, Daniel Craig will never passed for Connery, Moore or Bronson. He won't have the toys they had and he won't have the villians as well. Maybe Bond needed to be brought back to earth as Casino Royale have done. Maybe Bond needs to go after common bad guys like terrorists, mass murderers and others instead of folks seeking world control.I thought  Casino Royale was well made Bond film that cut down the high tech toys and worked on the story that appears to fit more closely to what Bond should be doing. While he may not be savig the world one more time, he does what secret service agents should be doing, going after bad guys that threatened safety and security of his nation.The DVD of Casino Royale turned out to be quite a treat. I am writing the review for the two disc special. I can say that the image from the DVD proves to be totally pristine and colors were vivid and clear. The sound proves to be aggressive, clear and well spread.

Redman,"[2, 5]","It makes me sick to read the negative reviews stating Craig isn't Bond or that any true Bond fan wouldn't like this film because it's different from the rest of them. B.S. Everytime the actor changes Bond is different and not just in how the actor portrays the role. Lazanby was nothing like Connery. His Bond was very drab and laid back, lacking the intensity Connery had. Moore was more witty, sometimes to the point it could be more properly referred to as half-wit. He brought silliness to the Bond franchise that wasn't there before and hasn't been there since. Timothy Dalton was a major change of direction. His Bond was hard edged, much like craig is now, and ruthless. Consequently people that had been used to Moore's portrayal hated Dalton, many still do. Brosnan was like none of them and like all of them at the same time. He tried to hard sometimes to do it all and not be his own Bond at times. Craig is not as sophisticated as Bond of yore. But than again that's the point. this movie is about how he got to the point of sophistication he's at in the other films. To those who can't see beyond what's on screen the next Bond will help build that arch a little more. It's due November of '08.Every time a new actor took over this role a whole slew of people complain about the new actor not being Bond. Some people just can't get over change. I became a Bond fan when I saw GoldenEye. I had to go back and see the earlier films after seeing the Brosnan Bond. I saw Moonraker next and if any Bond film should be dissed on that one should. The sheer differences between those films didn't disuade me from viewing any other Moore Bond films nor of looking into Connery, Lazenby, and Dalton. I've enjoyed them all, some more than others (i.e. Moonraker) and I expect to continue enjoying these films no matter how much Craig is different from Brosnan.P.S. Anyone who writes that the movie is boring because it's not wall to wall action and explosions probably has ADD. Those scenes are not boring. At the most they are deliberately paced to establish suspense and intrigue.

In over forty years, the character has been played by just over five actors, including Sean Connery, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, and most recently Pierce Brosnan. Each actor brought their abilities into the role and embodied Bond in a different fashion (for better or worse), but for Casino Royale, Brosnan has been replaced instead by Daniel Craig, who has appeared in action films such as Tomb Raider and dramas such as Road to Peredition. He is a younger Bond with a fiercer look, but a more vulnerable interior... and thankfully, that is precisely what is needed for the film.Rather than continuing on from previous films in the franchise, Casino Royale opts to reboot the series and bring Bond back to the beginning of his career... to the very moment he becomes Agent 007. With two assassinations in quick succession, Bond comes charging into the world, exercising his newfound license to kill with a raw, murderous candor... but hidden beneath the apathy is a small trace of humanity that has yet to die out. By the end of the film, that will change--he will be changed--and whatever remnants of his soul are left will perish.But before James Bond can truly become 007, he must first travel to Montenegro, Italy to take part in a high-stakes poker game hosted by the criminal financier Le Chiffre. His mission? To ensure Le Chiffre loses his money--to make him so desperate that he will sell out his clients to MI6 and shed light on a clandestine organization that poses a significant threat to Queen and empire.It is a dangerous game, since Le Chiffre is fully aware of who Bond is and why he is there (making Bond's usual stupidity of revealing his name to villains part of the plot), and the man tolerates him out of desperate straits and impending need to accept MI6's protection. The cards are dealt, the players stare each other down, and the game begins--but Bond soon realizes that Le Chiffre knows too much of his plays... someone is feeding him information, but the traitor lies just out of reach....M is once more played by Judi Dench (who took the role in Goldeneye), but new characters also appear, most notably Eva Green as Vesper Lynd and Giancarlo Giannini as Rene Mathis. Mathis is French Secret Service, but Vesper is merely a desk agent representing Her Majesty's Treasury... and despite her snark and spunk, is wholly unfamiliar with the brand of deadly field wet-work that Bond represents. In spite of the armor that he has built over himself, Bond is intrigued by her... he begins to lose himself in her (take the entendre as you will). This is the first time we have seen a woman in his life that means more to him than a fling or a cover. Bond is maturing--the advent of actual substance into ""Bond Girls"" has been long in the coming.Also matured is the plot in general--for the first time, characters and motivations actually make sense... you may have to dig for the connections, and some plot holes still linger, but at least these discrepancies are not as ostentatious as previous films. In recent years, the Jason Bourne movies have created different expectations in the spy genre--the romantic fallacy of the spy has worn away, and the relevancy of James Bond along with it. Thankfully, Casino Royale has learned from this development rather than simply ignore the shift in audience expectations.Bond is still a womanizer, but this time it is less a character flaw that impedes his mission, and more of a sharpened skill that he uses to get what he needs--Bond's sex appeal has been weaponized. Why torture and interrogate a man for information when you can seduce his wife and get the same info over pleasure?James Bond is no longer a hero--he never was, but this is the first time that the series has openly acknowledged and addressed what he really is: the Queen's hired gun. He is an assassin--a bully of Western imperialism sent out to police the world... and those he cannot coerce, he merely kills. There is no romance in that... and so, Casino Royale becomes self-aware, telling the story of a man losing his soul to a career that is (dare we say) almost inherently evil. Just because 007 has a license from the crown to kill people and get away with it doesn't erase its damning effects on his own humanity.Casino Royale breaks Bond down and reveals him--it doesn't celebrate in stylized murder and bloodshed like the comically superficial films of yore. Casino Royale isn't dumb, and it doesn't insult your intelligence by glorifying a film about a career-killer. For good or bad, the overplayed antics of Roger Moore are long over--this isn't a brainless action film anymore. The 21st Bond movie injects thematic depth into a formula series that has suffered too long under shallow pageantry.In short, Casino Royale is more than just a Bond film--it is a genuinely good movie. Pop culture has found substance without losing any of its ""pop"". Rather than James Bond portrayed as a distant, alienating figure--almost Homeric in his senseless elevation--Casino Royale brings him up close under the microscope and reveals who he really is. It is a character study with bouts of action and explosions lining the periphery. This is still a genre film, and it will never really be a piece of ""high art"" (no one wants that anyway)... but this film does give James Bond the depth and roundness that he has always deserved.",5,The tale of Bond's origins... and of his soul... is finally told,1357689600,"01 9, 2013",2013,5480,"['Casino', 'Royale', 'Twenty-first', 'James', 'Bond', 'film', 'Eon', 'released', 'Dr.',

For me it is a very average, although still watchable, action movie, but nothing more. It actually gets a little bit boring here and there and some fast forwarding was necessary, because this thing is LONG.The opening action scene is possibly the best thing in the film and the main villain, Le Chiffre, has a couple of good moments - but he cannot even stand next to most of previous James Bond enemies... The second action scene (on the airport) was not bad either - but that was the last really good moment in this film, even if M also had a couple of good lines.I found Eva Green pathetic as main James Bond girl and her character was half woden and half annoying. Also 007 fell in love only once before and it was with a girl played by Diana Rigg - and Eva Green is not even remotely as beautiful and neither does she have any charm or talent. The character of Felix Leiter is also pale.Towards the end I really wanted this film to end already, so I can start forgetting most of it. Three stars mostly for two good action scenes and also because the next two films were even less satisfying.I really hope we will finally get again a real 007 film, with a REAL James Bond (and not some street thug), really outlandish villains, hilarious gadgets, funny dialogs and especially really sexy James Bond girls (who will whisper &#34;Oh, James&#34; in critical moments)...

Of course, great action movies need great leads, and Daniel Craig is just that. Despite playing a really, really tough guy, his performance is nuanced, even subtle at times. This Bond is a real guy, folks. A tough as nails, adrenaline charged tough guy of the sort we've probably met in lesser incarnations. If he needs to kill you, he will, and he's pretty good about rationalizing the whole business. Hey, it's a tough world, after all, and he's willing get his [...] ruptured to protect good people from bad guys that would like nothing more than to kill each and everyone one of us. We need this James Bond.Okay, the plot, at times, seems a bit Byzantine, but that's a good chunk of the pleasure. In addition, the story, the motivations, and the relationships are spot on, and the underlying premise plays out as completely convincing. The film is all about finding a way to make a mastermind terror financier talk. How better to do that than arrange for a way to put him on the short list of the devils he finances. That his own weaknesses are part of the set-up is all the more satisfying.Oh, and you want a bond girl? One that can actually act? One that isn't a cookie-cutter? One that you actually start caring about?  That's here, too.Eva Green is stunningly beautiful because of who she is, not how she looks in a low cut cocktail dress.

The only reason I am doing this is to prevent readers from investing in something based on the hype surrounding this film, and its bland leading man Daniel Craig.Now, I am sure Daniel Craig is a nice enough man, but he is woefully miscast in the role of Bond. He brings literally nothing to the role, and all his limpid blue eye-action cannot save this from the train wreck it actually is. Not that he is a bad-looking person, but this is one actor who has virtually no charisma and has very wooden body language, so much so that even during his so called erotic scenes, he seems bored and disinterested, more keen on forcing the camera to love him. No Daniel, this just does not work. This is by far the worst Bond ever, especially since Pierce Brosnan set such a high standard for anyone to live up to.I must say that Eva Green (the royal from ""Kingdom of Heaven"") is a sure find. She is beautiful in that most obscure way (such as Claire Forlani in ""Meet Joe Black"") that its impossible to hate her. In fact, if they had made a whole film about her instead, maybe this wouldn't have been such a terrible film. She isn't a talented actress per se, but is absolutely perfect as a Bond girl.Which brings us to the storyline, or lack of one. Of all the remakes, this is the worst, primarily due to Craig's constant expression of ongoing indigestion, coupled with a very weak backing cast. Judi Dench's allure and charisma are all flushed down the toilet, as she is portrayed her as an insecure and rather matronly mother-figure, with some of the worst one-liners. Should be seen to be believed. I cannot believe they reduced this amazing character to the bowl of mush we see before us today.Maybe its because I'm a guy, but I do not find Daniel Craig capable of acting to save his life, and the people I saw this with were as puzzled as I was.

Bond when he was just beginning. and like everyone else in an infantile stage, one is green, immature, believe you're invincible, and have a huge ego. that's exactly how Bond is in this movie, and i think Craig embodies those characteristics greatly. he effectively portrays Bond as naive, sensitive, but tough and cool. Craig has a good swagger for this ""Pre-Bond."" this is a different type of Bond and it was refreshing to see a different side. but Bond will transform into the ultra-cool, aloof, womanizing, confident, unflinching type, and Craig, after haven been betrayed by the woman he's madly in love with (eva green), and yet to discover that her betrayal was to save his life, shows the transition in just one scene, the ending scene. he is now the Bond we all know and love. he is now rough and tough, and wiser, and essentially will not get emotional in any aspect of his work. he almost has no feelings anymore. and mainly he will now regard women as just a hit and run.lol....the one big and very few peeve i had with the film, was Eva Green as the Bond girl. i think she was terribly miscast. it is only my opinion but i don't see much sexuality in her. she is very thin and i don't think she's sexy. i don't want to sound mean, but i'm just stating what i felt, and that is, her face is not that pretty or compelling either. she is very bland. i think ms. green would be excellent in a dramatic movie, and probably look great in it too. but she is not supposed to be in a Bond movie. it's like she's out of place. she doesn't look like an ""action"" girl. more like period movies. she would be great in them. Bond women are always, sexy, and curvy, and have this certain spark, and i just felt that ms. green did not possess that spark. i mainly look forward to seeing the Bond girl, and i felt very dissapointed watching her. the mistress of the villain should have been the Bond girl. you don't have to be terribly beautiful, but at least sexy and have a spark and she had it more... all in all i recommend this movie. come on, you can't miss a Bond movie!",4,"good movie, but not outstanding",1175212800,"03 30, 2007",2007,3337,"['i', 'think', 'like', 'iconic', 'Bond', 'so', 'much', 'so', 'iconic', 'even', 'mediocore', 'Bond', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'good', 'other', 'words', 'Bond', 'movie', 'never', 'bad', 'always', 'something', 'outweigh', 'something', 'else', 'actor', 'playing', 'Bond', 'good', 'women', 'are', 'hot', 'action', 'good', 'i', ""'m"", 'not', 'calling', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'mediocre', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'i', 'think', 'acting', 'up', 'par', 'good', 'dialogue', 'yet', 'positively', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'dialogue', 'movies', 'boring', 'dialogue', 'quick', 'sage', 'depth', 'meaning', 'concise', ""n't"", 'cheesy', 'yet', 'i', 'think', 'downfall', 'script', ""n't"", 'up', 'par', 'was', ""n't"", 'actors', 'fault', 'difficult', 'explain', 'story', 'line', 'was', ""n't"", 'engaging', 'enough', 'lot', 'action', 'lot', 'good', 'action', 'where', 'i', 'give', 'A.', '2nd', 'opening', 'scene', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'chasing', 'guy', 'backpack', 'end', 'up', 'high', 'beams', 'construction', 'sites', 'whoa', 'were', 'good', 'stunts', 'had', 'edge', 'seat', 'speaking', 'Mr.', 'Craig', 'A+', 'i', ""'m"", 'not', 'only', 'talking', 'rugged', 'good', 'looks', 'sexy', 'voice', 'piercing', 'diamond', 'blue', 'eyes', 'sexy', 'manly', 'body', 'HOTT', 'i', 'think', 'acting', 'A.', 'Bond', 'first', 'assignment', 'Bond', 'when', 'was', 'just', 'beginning', 'everyone', 'else', 'infantile', 'stage', 'one', 'green', 'immature', 'believe', ""'re"", 'invincible', 'have', 'huge', 'ego', 'exactly', 'how', 'Bond', 'movie', 'i', 'think', 'Craig', 'embodies', 'characteristics', 'greatly', 'effectively', 'Bond', 'naive', 'sensitive', 'tough', 'cool', 'Craig', 'good', 'swagger', 'Pre-Bond', 'different', 'type', 'Bond', 'was', 'refreshing', 'see', 'different', 'side', 'Bond', 'will', 'transform', 'ultra-cool', 'aloof', 'womanizing', 'confident', 'unflinching', 'type', 'Craig', 'haven', 'been', 'betrayed', 'woman', 'madly', 'love', 'eva', 'green', 'yet', 'discover', 'betrayal', 'was', 'save', 'life', 'transition', 'just', 'one', 'scene', 'ending', 'scene', 'now', 'Bond', 'know', 'love', 'now', 'rough', 'tough', 'wiser', 'essentially', 'will', 'not', 'get', 'emotional', 'aspect', 'work', 'almost', 'feelings', 'anymore', 'mainly', 'will', 'now', 'regard', 'women', 'just', 'hit', 'run.lol', 'one', 'big', 'very', 'few', 'peeve', 'i', 'had', 'film', 'was', 'Eva', 'Green', 'Bond', 'girl', 'i', 'think', 'was', 'terribly', 'miscast', 'only', 'opinion', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'much', 'sexuality', 'very', 'thin', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'sexy', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'sound', 'mean', 'i', ""'m"", 'just', 'stating', 'what', 'i', 'felt', 'face', 'not', 'pretty', 'compelling', 'either', 'very', 'bland', 'i', 'think', 'ms.', 'green', 'would', 'be', 'excellent', 'dramatic', 'movie', 'probably', 'look', 'great', 'too', 'not', 'supposed', 'be', 'Bond', 'movie', 'place', ""n't"", 'look', 'action', 'girl', 'more', 'like', 'period', 'movies', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'Bond', 'women', 'are', 'always', 'sexy', 'curvy', 'have', 'certain', 'spark', 'i', 'just', 'felt', 'ms.', 'green', 'did', 'not', 'possess', 'spark', 'i', 'mainly', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'Bond', 'girl', 'i', 'felt', 'very', 'dissapointed', 'watching', 'mistress', 'villain', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'Bond', 'girl', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'terribly', 'beautiful', 'least', 'sexy', 'have', 'spark', 'had', 'more', 'i', 'recommend', 'movie', 'come', 'ca', ""n't"", 'miss', 'Bond', 'movie']",N/A

British intelligence agency MI6 assigns this designation to their premier agents who have made two kills in the line of duty.  And James Bond (Daniel Craig) has just made that designation.His first assignment is to find a bomb maker and use him to track the terrorists ultimately responsible.  While he wants the man alive, the situation turns deadly, and Bond is lucky to get out with his life.  He does manage to get one clue, the word ""Ellipse"" and the phone number the text message came from.  The trail leads him first to the Bahamas, then Miami.Behind the scenes is Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelson).  He's a banker to terrorists the world over.  When Bond interferes with his original plan, Le Chiffre finds himself in major debt.  To earn the money to pay off his bills, he sets up a very high stakes poker game at the famous Casino Royale.  MI6 sends Bond to play.  Will poker be the end of Le Chiffre and his funding of terrorism?The movie starts well with a couple of clever action sequences that had me entertained.  I was hoping that the rest of the movie would be that good.  Then the second half hits, and the movie slows way down.  The poker scenes dragged, even for someone with an interest in poker.  And the action scenes the interrupt the poker are boring, too.  And the story slows to let us wonder if Bond will be okay.  Frankly, I just wanted to know how he'd be okay.But wait, we aren't done yet.  The movie keeps going after what appears to be the climax.  As each scene drew to a close, I thought the movie might be ending, but it just kept going.  And, in trying to add a twist or two, the story get almost impossible to follow.This is a shame since the movie has some good performances.  Daniel Craig is great as Bond.  And Judi Dench is funny as Bond's boss, ""M.""  Eva Green adds some laughs as an accountant assigned to work with Bond.  The two have some wonderful scenes together with easily the funniest lines of the movie.The movie is two and a half hours long.

1048504,A2D37EP9KT2E3D,B000MNP2K8,"Mark bennett ""Mark""","[4, 8]","Daniel Craig reinvents the James Bond character in this film and the results are shockingly good. I didn't expect much given that Casino Royale (the source material) isn't a very good story to begin with. But they made the most of it.Craig is the first actor to play the role who actually has the physical presence to credibly pull it off. While others looked at home at parties but looked silly once the action started, Craig can do both. He also has the emotional detachment necessary to play the character in a convincing way.I would rather have seen Judi Dench not be in the film (a clean break) because she comes off as an abrasive mother rather than a tough boss. But thankfully John Cleese is gone this time as well as the old introduction of the gadgets to be used later scene which in my opinion never worked onscreen. The Felix Lighter (CIA) character was unnecessary and didn't really work. But he wasn't around much thankfully.In terms of plot, the flim pulls off a gradual build better than most bond films. We see bond tearing down a plot (and a man) one step at a time hopping all over the globe as he does it. He work his way logically through the case from beginning to end. Every location used as a backdrop is exotic but doesn't remain on screen so long that it gets boring.I expected the card game to be boring. But they found a way to make it work by putting breaks in that allowed for ""the game"" to progress in other ways.This was an amazing film in any number of ways. It took a character on its last legs and somehow reinvented it by going back to basics. It also took the action movie format itself and made it seem interesting for the first time in many years.

1048506,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B000MNP2K8,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[0, 0]","Detractors of this film will harp on how it sullies the tradition of Bond, how it usurps the normal conventions and reinvents something that was already perfect to begin with.  Most of these people seem to be more in love with the formula than with movies that are memorable and well-done.  The Bond series, indeed, is a beloved institution, but this movie proves that it can be so much more.Whereas the films were once merely vehicles for every spy trope in the book (nifty gadgets, cool cars, easily-bedded babes, and villains with vatloads of henchmen), ""Casino Royale"" opts instead to embrace a story with vaguely realistic elements.  Bond himself was relegated long ago to the status of a mostly meaningless symbol.  He was less a human than he was a poorly concealed fantasy of slick, emotionless machismo.  Sure, throughout the years Bond has shown his share of fear, hate, and even love, but those feelings were always sublimated beneath the glossy veneer of a man who is never ruffled, never confused, and never orders anything other than the standard shaken martini.""Casino Royale"" opts to rip off that veneer.  Daniel Craig plays Bond with your typical bad-boy stubborness, but you can actually see what makes him human, restrained (just barely) beneath his laser-blue eyes and his awkwardly handsome smile.  He's a classy Bond, as always, but that class seems uncomfortably worn on him; he prefers to get straight to business, prefers to barge rather than sneak, and when the bartender asks him if he wants his martini shaken or stirred, he snaps back, ""Do I look like I give a damn?""Oh, he gives a damn.  Just not about drinks.  This time around Bond is up against Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen), illegitimate banker for the world's wealthiest terrorists.  His weakness (aside from an eye that occasionally weeps blood) is gambling, mostly with his clients' money.  Due to Bond's meddling, he's deep in the hole and facing some villains of his own.  To break even, he hosts a high-stakes poker game.  Of course, Bond is there, accompanied by Vesper Lynd (Eva Green), a British Treasury official, who is there to finance Bond's hand and make sure the agent doesn't lose millions of the Queen's hard-earned cash.  She is ""Royale's"" answer to the Bond girl, a frigidly beautiful woman whose guard is up as high as Bond's, and this time, when they clash, the sparks that fly are legitimate.  Previous Bonds were played like men who would slip into the sack at the slightest provocation, men of pleasure as much as anything else.  Craig's Bond certainly has that in him, but he is business before anything else, and so is Vesper.  It's no wonder they are both drawn to and repelled by each other.  They both think they've got the other's number, and they play their hands accordingly, but of course, nothing is quite that simple.  At one point, Bond says, ""You don't play the cards.  You play the man holding the cards.""  In this case, the man is a woman, and Bond has finally met his match.The poker game that forms the heart of this film is, thusly, all about taut and riveting psychology, and it mirrors the rest of the film, a movie that deigns to show a less-glossy and more-vulnerable man in the place of the Spy Who Always Gets Away.  ""Royale"" offers action, sexiness, intrigue, and plenty of explosions and wrecks, but its centerpiece is its dark, whirling mentality, the fact that, finally, the audience is allowed a glimpse into the heart and soul of a spy.

Of course Sean Connery was the greatest, with some of the most beautiful women in the world in those films, but others like the other Englishman, et cetra, were simply not the Bond types.  Especially Casino Royale was previously made several times, and with Sean Connery, was a great movie, but with this current failure, Craig, who spent the first 20 minutes of the movie jumping and leaping through construction sites that probably no one would be able to do even if they wanted to.

Fortunately, with Casino Royale and Daniel Craig, I sensed reinvigoration to the series and recognized I once again found the franchise thrilling.Craig's Bond is a refreshing diversion, more urban than urbane, confident and competent but falling short of cynical hubris of Connery, Moore or Brosnan. He is rugged rather than elegant and with this step back to the nascent persona much more introspective. While he is undoubtedly 007, he has not experienced so much that his compassion and passion has been misplaced.Casino Royale introduces a freshly credentialed 00 agent, with his spurs so to speak, earned early in the film. The gadgetry we have become so accustomed to is thankfully absent instead replaced by guile, wits, and in some instances, pure luck.  This is a Bond who lacks all the answers and more importantly, fails give the impression he has prior knowledge of all of the questions.  Both the antagonist, with a decidedly predominant of ideological rather than tyrannical bent and the requisite love interest are outside the stereotypical characterizations of the series' later films.This version of Bond may not care if the martini is shaken or stirred but if like me you've found the entire series most recently overly dry, this one might very well be the mix to suit your taste.",5,Tranfusion of lively new blood,1233360000,"01 31, 2009",2009,1582,"['Somewhere', 'trail', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'exactly', 'where', 'simply', 'tired', 'predictability', 'Bond', 'movies', 'never', 'stopped', 'watching', 'probably', 'perverse', 'personal', 'obligation', 'say', 'had', 'seen', 'regardless', 'not', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'Fortunately', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'sensed', 'reinvigoration', 'series', 'recognized', 'once', 'again', 'found', 'franchise', 'thrilling.Craig', 'Bond', 'refreshing', 'diversion', 'more', 'urban', 'urbane', 'confident', 'competent', 'falling', 'short', 'cynical', 'hubris', 'Connery', 'Moore', 'Brosnan', 'rugged', 'rather', 'elegant', 'step', 'back', 'nascent', 'persona', 'much', 'more', 'introspective', 'undoubtedly', '007', 'not', 'experienced', 'so', 'much', 'compassion', 'passion', 'been', 'misplaced.Casino', 'Royale', 'freshly', 'credentialed', '00', 'agent', 'spurs', 'so', 'speak', 'earned', 'early', 'film', 'gadgetry', 'have', 'become', 'so', 'accustomed', 'thankfully', 'absent', 'instead', 'replaced', 'guile', 'wits', 'instances', 'pure', 'luck', 'Bond', 'who', 'answers', 'more', 'importantly', 'give', 'impression', 'prior', 'knowledge', 'questions', 'antagonist', 'decidedly', 'predominant', 'ideological', 'rather', 'tyrannical', 'bent', 'requisite', 'love', 'interest', 'are', 'stereotypical', 'characterizations', 'series', 'later', 'films.This', 'version', 'Bond', 'may', 'not', 'care', 'martini', 'shaken', 'stirred', ""'ve"", 'found', 'entire', 'series', 'most', 'recently', 'overly', 'dry', 'one', 'might', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'mix', 'suit', 'taste']",N/A

1048514,A2MHDZXWWF0VIN,B000MNP2K8,Matthew Kresal,"[2, 3]","It took fifty-three for Casino Royale to make its way to the big screen (not counting a 1954 TV film and 1967 spoof) and it now seems both fitting and ironic that the first, and arguably best, Bond novel should serve as the first Bond film of Daniel Craig. Even more ironic is the fact that one of the best Bond novels has lead to the best Bond film yet. That fact though, is just the icing on the cake for what looks to be the new beginning of 007.Daniel Craig's debut as Bond is nothing short of stunning. Many wondered if this blond actor better known for his more serious acting roles could be an action hero. The answer: a definite yes. Craig brings a physical magnetism to the part of Bond missing really since the early Sean Connery films and he is believable in all of the films action sequences. But what really sells Craig is his acting abilities. Craig brings a very serious approach to Bond. He is everything Bond should be: cold, ruthless, and capable of being a human being. And when it comes to humor, which a lot of fans were worried about, Craig is just as adept. Any doubts about Craig as Bond, they should be taken away at the very end of the film where Craig gets to say ""The name's Bond James Bond"" for the first time. Craig is the best Bond since Timothy Dalton and arguably he has even surpassed Dalton.Eva Green plays Vesper Lynd, the representative from the MI6 sent with Bond on his first major mission as a 00 agent. Green brings a considerable amount of acting ability to this role and she is far from your average Bond girl. While beautiful and truly stunning physically, Green is an actress and she gets to prove it more then really any other Bond girl. Green is truly an amazing Bond girl and a welcomed relief to the stereotypically cardboard Bond girls.Mads Mikkelsen, a relatively unknown Dannish actor, makes an impressive Le Chiffre. Bond villains generally lack either believability or acting ability, especially since in Die Another Day. But there we get arguably the best Bond villain of the series to date. Le Chiffre is a villain, he is after all the man who serves as financier to the world's terrorists. Yet there is a surprising amount of humanity in him. He deformed eye that weeps tears of blood and his sense of both menace and humor make him the most three-dimensional Bond villain and even at times sympathetic. Mikkelson is the new face of Bond villains.The supporting cast is also great. Judi Dench returns as M, the head of MI6. Her scenes with Craig have a sense of menace to them that surpasses similar scenes with Pierce Brosnan. Dench had more or less inhabited the role of M since Goldeneye but in this film she once again makes the role her own. Jeffrey Wright makes a brief, but welcomed appearance as CIA agent Felix Lieter and we can only hope we see more of him in future films. Caterina Murno seems to be little more then window dressing as Solange, a girlfriend of one of the villains, but she leaves one wishing we'd seen more of her in this film.The script is also perhaps the best to be written for a Bond film. Based on the novel by Fleming, the films plot is an update of the plot of Fleming's novel. The plot is realistic and the lack of gadgets doesn't hurt the film at all. The love story, the first in a while, is a nice addition to the film. The lines are well written and time is taken to actually develop the plot to its fullest and Fleming would be, in my opinion, proud of this film adaptation.The action sequences of this film are stunning. From the gritty black and white fight in the opening teaser sequence the to the running sequence in Madagascar to the attempted bombing of Miami international airport to the stairwell fight and the gunfight in the falling house in Venice at the end, the action sequences have a sense of realism missing from many of the Bond films.Campbell, who directed Brosnan's debut in Goldeneye, does another stunning job in this film. Working with cinematographer Phil Meheux (who also did Goldeneye) and editor Stuart Baird, Campbell created a visual style that brings a new sense of style to the series. From the excellently done black and white teaser detailing how Bond got his 00 number, to the shaky hand held sequence during which Bond is poisoned, and the darkness and shadows in the brilliantly done torture sequence, there is a sense of realism. The sets and costumes also help thanks to production designer Peter Lamont and costume designer Lindy Hemming.The music score by David Arnold is the icing on the cake. No longer having to adhere to the typical Bond score, Arnold creates his best Bond score yet and overall the best Bond score since John Barry's score for On Her Majesty's Secret Service. The score uses the Bond theme sparingly and when it comes back in full force at the end you welcome it back. The score makes good sue of a new love theme and sparingly uses electronics that had hampered the previous Arnold scores. The films theme song, You Know My Name by Chris Cornell, is a welcomed addition to the Bond theme songs and is a vast improvement over the last two or three Bond theme songs.With strong performances from the entire cast, one of the best scripts for any Bond film, strong direction from martin Campbell, terrific cinematography and a great score by David Arnold, Casino Royale delivers. This film was meant as a Bond reboot and it has more then done that. It the process of rebooting the series, the filmmakers have created the best Bond film yet.",5,The Best Bond Film Yet,1210723200,"05 14, 2008",2008,5497,"['took', 'fifty-three', 'Casino', 'Royale',

Daniel Craig gives a new spin to the tried and true 007 formula of non-stop action, beautiful women and international intrigue. His looks and laconic screen presence reminded me alot of Steve McQueen. It's almost as if Bond is being introduced for the first time because we get a real psychological insight into what makes this famous master spy tick. This is masterfully accomplished by action packed harrowing scenes including one torture scene that would make even Quentin Tarrantino blush. This is fitting since 'Casino Royale' was the book by Ian Fleming that first introduced the world to 007. The plot centers around a terrorist ring financed by a very deadly international financier called Le Chiffre. Bond must beat him in hold-em poker at a game where the buy-in is $10 million dollars and the prize is $150 million. Victory for Le Chiffre would mean money in the pockets of terrorists and as usual victory for Bond means saving the world.

For many people, at least one of their favourite films will no doubt include a Bond film. I'd never really been bothered until recently, when I watched Living Daylights and Licence To Kill. Two older Bond films, with Mr Suave, Timothy Dalton. I must admit, when Daniel Craig was originally announced as the new Bond, I couldn't really see why, but out of others who were nominated to be Bond (Clive Owen for instance, no!), I could see he would be the best out of them. I'd only previously seen him in Layer Cake, which didn't impress me.Before seeing it, I was ordered to keep my back turned to the TV, and informed that I wasn't allowed to ""moan, sigh, complain"" and generally grumble about what I was about to watch. That normally means I'm in for a bad film.When the film started, it was in black and white. And then I spotted what looked suspiciously like Daniel Craig. OK, I knew what this was. (But I didn't complain.)And then the credits started, and they quite literally took my breath away. When by myself, I am notorious for fast forwarding through credits, unless they're short and sweet, or I'm looking for a name. But instead of the dancing girls, who have appeared in previous Bonds, this was stunning. Using the theme of cards (diamonds, hearts etc) it shows characters breaking into pieces upon being shot at with a diamond.Then the film started, and I was reminded of the finale of True Lies, where Eliza Dushku is on that crane thing, being chased by the bad guy, and waiting for Arnie to pop up. OK, I was reminded of it, but Casino Royale surpassed it every way imaginable. It's probably a thousand times higher, and involving (painfully) jumping from different sections of a construction site, it certainly starts the film with a bang and puts Daniel through his paces.There has been a lot of press & fuss about the scene where Daniel walks out of a beautiful ocean, in little blue trunks. I think I was the only woman in the world not to swoon at this shot. Everyone seems to rave about it, but you don't see anything! Stop letting your imaginations run wild, girls! For starters, you don't even see a full length shot. The scene I nearly swooned at (until I realised what was happening) was the naked torture scene. I didn't get what was happening, why exactly the seat of the chair was cut out, until I realised what exactly was getting whipped. Guys, you will cross your legs, and not let your girlfriend anywhere near the crown jewels after seeing this scene. Ouch. I think I went to cross my legs.What impressed me about Casino Royale, and ultimately, Daniel's performance, were the scenes opposite Eva Green. The scene in the shower, after she's witnessed him kill two men, where he sits beside her, made me go all gooey inside, and I actually felt a bit teary. It certainly showed a different side to Bond, a more romantic, softer side, which has only been briefly shown in On Her Majesty's Secret Service, when he gets married and loses his wife in a few hours. And then the stunning finale. WOW. Without ruining it, it shows the same side to Bond again, despite the fact he's been betrayed, and I nearly cried again, but I would have been embarrassed, so I managed to hold it back.Although I haven't seen many Bond films, this seems to surpass everything that was before it, including Pierce Brosnan (everyone will be saying ""who?"" after seeing Casino Royale). Daniel seems to be physically able to take part in the fights and he fills out a tux quite well. It helps he also quit smoking, and put on 20lbs of pure muscle to play Bond.I loved the poker scenes, but there's no way I could ever play it, I'd have on obvious tail! It's amazing how much money some players will throw at this game.My third Bond film - my favourite Bond movie. As soon as I got home, I raved about this film to my dad, to the point I probably revealed too much about the film when he hasn't seen it. I'm still not 100% about Daniel as Bond, with his ice blue eyes, and blonde hair (although it does look grey in some of the poker scenes!), but he gave it all and managed to come out and portray an excellent Bond, despite all the criticism in the press. All the reviews that just say bad things about Daniel not being a good Bond etc - ignore. He gives it his all as Bond, and showed me a different side to the action man. People are just missing Brosnan, or can't open their minds enough to see the director wanted a new, different Bond. They found him. For me, Daniel is the ultimate Bond. For some, they may argue Sean Connery or others are the definitive Bonds, but for me, Daniel played it magnificently, and will hopefully continue to play Bond.

I was absolutely devastated when I learned that Pierce Brosnan wouldn't be returning for a fifth installment as Bond and that blondie Daniel Craig was chosen as the replacement. I spent almost two years dreading ""Casino Royale,"" convinced that it would be absolutely horrible and that Craig's performance would be a disgrace to the character. Well, all that worrying was a waste of time on my part. When I'm wrong, I say I'm wrong, and I was very wrong about this.Here's the bottom line: ""Casino Royale"" is the best Bond movie ever...hands-down.This film takes the series back to the very beginning, when Bond is first granted his double-0 status. Based on Ian Fleming's novel, ""Casino Royale"" opens with a gritty black and white sequence that depicts Bond's first government-sanctioned kills. The film soon seeps into full-color mode and features a fantastic 20-minute footchase between Bond and a sprinty African bombmaker. Bond soon finds himself hot on the tails of Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen), a terrorist banker who weeps tears of blood and has a nasty gambling habit that's lost his clients a lot of money. Le Chiffre decides to participate in a high-stakes French poker game in hopes of recouping his losses. MI6 sends Bond there to play against Le Chiffre and prevent him from winning. M (Judi Dench) sends a government accountant, Vesper Lynd (Eva Green), to keep an eye on Bond, but 007 can't manage to take his eyes off HER. Eventually Bond and Vesper find themselves in grave danger at the hands of Le Chiffre. There is torture, bloodshed, and suspense, but I don't want to give away any more of the plot because it's so exciting and I don't want to spoil it for anyone!Overall, ""Casino Royale"" is brilliant. Craig captures the true essence of James Bond that is depicted in Fleming's novels: an unstoppable killing machine. Craig's performance is also incredibly physical. (He did most of his own stunts for the film.) I really enjoyed the way that the film took a few steps back and attempted explain WHY Bond is the way he is (sort of the way in which ""Batman Begins"" reshaped the Batman franchise). This isn't the same suave and unfeeling Bond we all know and love. Craig's James Bond is much more human. He's very introspective and allows himself to fall in love with Vesper very easily. Ultimately, their romance doesn't have a happy ending, which explains why James is the way he is with women. So many pieces of the puzzle from more than 40 years of Bond movies fall into place because of this film.Daniel Craig, if you're reading this review, I'm so sorry that I ever doubted you! Now that I've seen the film, there is no doubt in my mind that you are TRULY James Bond! I still don't understand why the director didn't give you a box of Nice 'n Easy to darken up your hair a bit, but I got over the blonde thing after about ten minutes.James Bond is back, and he's better than ever! ""Casino Royale"" surpassed all my expectations.

Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[4, 6]","Before the 2006 film ""Casino Royale"" film was released in theaters, it caused a controversy among loyal James Bond fans because the actor chosen to play long-time spy James Bond, 007, was Daniel Craig, who is blond.  No other previous James Bond had been blond, but once people began to see the film, the trivial blond hair controversy quickly faded as the action-packed & far more realistic film caught everyone off guard.  Though there were several female characters in the film, there were no so-called ""Bond-girls"" to be found in this thriller.  Even gone were the silhouettes of naked women within the trademark opening credits of the film.  Thus, what director Martin Campbell (who directed the 1995 James Bond film ""GoldenEye"") and executive producers Callum McDougall (who produced the 2004 ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" and the 2002 ""Die Another Day"") and Anthony Waye (who also produced ""Die Another Day"" and ""GoldenEye"") wanted to portray in ""Casino Royale"" was a raw and very human James Bond, who was also athletically fit and strong-minded.Based upon Ian Fleming's (1908-1964) first-ever James Bond book entitled ""Casino Royale"", published in 1953, Bond battles an underworld figure known as Le Chiffre (which literally means ""the cypher"" and was played by Mads Mikkelsen) who is a financier to various terrorist organizations.  To bolster is dwindling finances, Le Chiffre organizes a high-stakes poker game (originally a baccarat game) in the famous European ""Casino Royale"".  However, things don't go as planned due to Bond's participation, with the assistance of British government representative Vesper Lynd (Eva Green).With stellar acting from Daniel Craig, Mads Mikkelsen and Judi Dench (who reprised her role as ""M""), a brilliant story and lots of action, ""Casino Royale"" earns a well-deserved 5 out of 5 stars and quite possibly is the best James Bond film ever produced.  I look forward to any future James Bond films starring Daniel Craig as James Bond.As a side note, the 1967 comedic version of ""Casino Royale"" (that starred David Niven, Peter Sellers, Ursula Andress, Orson Wells and Woody Allen) was also based upon the original 1953 ""Casino Royale"" novel.  It includes the character Le Chiffre (Orson Wells) and retains the original game of baccarat and the organization known as SMERSH, but that organization (lead by Woody Allen's character, the James Bond's nephew) was quite different from the book and not included in the 2006 serious film version.",5,Quite Possibly the Best James Bond Film of All Time,1186790400,"08 11, 2007",2007,2496,"['2006', 'film', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'theaters', 'caused', 'controversy', 'loyal', 'James', 'Bond', 'fans', 'actor', 'chosen', 'play', 'long-time', 'spy', 'James', 'Bond', '007', 'was', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'who', 'blond', 'other', 'previous', 'James', 'Bond', 'had', 'been', 'blond', 'once', 'people', 'began', 'see', 'film', 'trivial', 'blond', 'hair', 'controversy', 'quickly', 'faded', 'action-packed', 'far', 'more', 'realistic', 'film', 'caught', 'everyone', 'off', 'guard', 'were', 'several', 'female', 'characters', 'film', 'were', 'so-called', 'Bond-girls', 'be', 'found', 'thriller', 'Even', 'gone', 'were', 'silhouettes', 'naked', 'women', 'trademark', 'opening', 'credits', 'film', 'Thus', 'what', 'director', 'Martin', 'Campbell', 'who', 'directed', '1995', 'James', 'Bond', 'film', 'GoldenEye', 'executive', 'producers', 'Callum', 'McDougall', 'who', 'produced', '2004', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Prisoner', 'Azkaban', '2002', 'Die', 'Day', 'Anthony', 'Waye', 'who', 'also', 'produced', 'Die', 'Day', 'GoldenEye', 'wanted', 'portray', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'was', 'raw', 'very', 'human', 'James', 'Bond', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'athletically', 'fit', 'strong-minded.Based', 'upon', 'Ian', 'Fleming', '1908-1964', 'first-ever', 'James', 'Bond', 'book', 'entitled', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'published', '1953', 'Bond', 'underworld', 'figure', 'known', 'Le', 'Chiffre', 'literally', 'cypher', 'was', 'played', 'Mads', 'Mikkelsen', 'who', 'financier', 'various', 'terrorist', 'organizations', 'bolster', 'dwindling', 'finances', 'Le', 'Chiffre', 'high-stakes', 'poker', 'game', 'originally', 'baccarat', 'game', 'famous', 'European', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'However', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'as', 'planned', 'due', 'Bond', 'participation', 'assistance', 'British', 'government', 'representative', 'Vesper', 'Lynd', 'Eva', 'Green', '.With', 'stellar', 'acting', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'Mads', 'Mikkelsen', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'who', 'reprised', 'role', 'M', 'brilliant', 'story', 'lots', 'action', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'well-deserved', '5', '5', 'stars', 'quite', 'possibly', 'best', 'James', 'Bond', 'film', 'ever', 'produced', 'look', 'forward', 'future', 'James', 'Bond', 'films', 'starring', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'James', 'Bond.As', 'side', 'note', '1967', 'comedic', 'version', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'starred', 'David', 'Niven', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'Ursula', 'Andress', 'Orson', 'Wells', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'was', 'also', 'based', 'original', '1953', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'novel', 'character', 'Le', 'Chiffre', 'Orson', 'Wells', 'original', 'game', 'baccarat', 'organization', 'known', 'SMERSH', 'organization', 'lead', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'character', 'James', 'Bond', 'nephew', 'was', 'quite', 'different', 'book', 'not', 'included', '2006', 'serious', 'film', 'version']",N/A

And for a movie with no gadgets, it sure was convienent that Bond happens to have an EKG machine in the glove compartment in his car in case random heart attacking posions are ingested.

Craig is and has always had weight, focus and importance on the screen. And as James Bond he brings all of these qualities to bear and ""Casino Royale"" is the better for it.Many actors were rumored to have been considered for the re-inventing of James Bond and Daniel Craig was not a popular choice but his interpretation here should put all the naysayers at bay for Craig more than re-invents...he makes this part his own.Martin Campbell (""Goldeneye,"" ""Beyond Borders"") stays clear of all the wham-bam, thank you M'am special effects of all the former James Bond films and concentrates on the things that make all films important: character, relationships and emotional commitment.The James Bond of ""Casino Royale"" (it was the first in Ian Fleming's series of books on Bond) has just been given the so-called honor of the ""007"" impranteur and, though he has been an operative for a time, he is still considered the odd man out, the dangerous one, the one who will stop at nothing to solves his cases. On the surface this would seem like the ideal government spy but the operative word here is ""government,"" the biggest block of bureaucracy there ever is or was and as such ""it"" requires Bond to follow procedure as M (Judi Dench) reminds him time and again.The Bond of ""Casino Royale""is physical, violent, without too much conscience, sexy, fit: more likely to kick you in the groin than serve you a glass of White Burgundy. But this Bond also has a heart and, though he has a couple of dalliances with women, he makes a real connection to one in particular, Eva Green as Vesper Lynd. Though I would have liked somone with a warmer, cushier screen presence than Green, this romance also sets up what is to become of Bond, romance-wise for the rest of the Bond series of novels and, I assume....films.The action sequences are personal and physical (the kind that you never saw Brosnan do) as well as excitingly staged and produced.

For once it was nice to see someone who can actually fight commando style fill the role.We finally see how Bond became Bond and the movie tells how Bond first me Felix Leiter.  This Bond is more ruthless than his predecessors, without the smugness of Moore or Brosnon.  Additionally, this Bond seems to bear his emotions, something we have never seen before and he seems to treat women on a more equal level.  I see this Bond as a lot closer to the Jason Bourne character played by Matt Damon then to any of the previous Bonds.Though I liked the Brosnon portrayals, his movies were predictable and difficult to differentiate between any of the prior movies.

Based on the very first Bond book this fast paced high-octane thriller is something we have not seen in a 007 film since ""Goldfinger"". This is a movie, movie and by that I mean it exemplifies the ingredients you need to make a great film.""Casino Royale"" shines first in a very tight and brilliantly adult screenplay. This is by far the most interesting and complex of thrillers in a very long time. All the rather tired old comic strip aspects of previous Bond films have been swept away from outlandish plots to the old fashioned double entendre that used to pop on the screen like cartoon bubbles.This Bond is witty but with a finer more modern approach. He is truly sophisticated but with some rough edges that catch and tear at the ear with both humor and intelligence.Fine direction by Martin Campbell pushes the action, the actors and ultimately the audience to new heights of action and romance. He shows us in the most jaw dropping way that to kill someone is not easy; it is a messy hard and dirty job. And you can get bloody in the process. Bravo for putting the grit back into Bond.Then there is the cast, a stunning array of international talent and indeed some of the finest actors around today shine and sparkle forever like diamonds in this film.Eva Green as Vesper Lind is by far the best ""Bond Girl"" to date. She is an actress of great range and talent that brings Vesper to heart stopping life. Her talent combined with great writing and direction has amalgamated in this film to create what may be the only fully rounded and human ""Bond Girl"" ever seen.Mads Mikkelsen is astonishingly good as the villain Le Chiffre is a real delight to watch. This is no ""Dr. Evil"" but a cold desperate criminal who when cornered is liable to go nuts on you.Here Judi Dench is given her most complex ""M"" to date and carries if off with her very special gifts as an actress. She as always is a delight. And in this film you learn a few things about ""M"" that might surprise you.Then there is Daniel Craig who makes his debut as Bond. And boy's roll out the red carpet and put up the velvet ropes. This performance will bring him to the forefront of movie stars who are also exceptional actors. This is a man who can act, and yet never let you catch him at it. A talent that ranks with the top fine actors today such as Russell Crowe,He inhabits this very rough and dangerous Bond at the birth of the character and gives us a hot, hard, thug who though the course of the film is transformed by human design and circumstance into ""Bond, James Bond"". He is simply breathtaking to watch.The film has a brain and also tips it's hat to great thrillers of the past especially ""North By Northwest"" as exemplified by the very sexy and delightful train scene where Bond and Vesper meet for the first time. But the most surprising aspect of ""Casino Royale"" is how human it is and how heartbreakingly romantic it can be amid the very dirty business of international espionage.this spcial two disc blue-ray edition is stunning to behold with a perfect picture and window shattering sound. The extras are simply grand as well.This movie at last brings magic back to the movies and heart to the Bond franchise.",5,A Breathtaking Film Experience!,1164067200,"11 21, 2006",2006,3301,"['Bond', 'back', 'Craig', 'got', 'Here', 'last', 'long', 'anticipated', 'film', 'version', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'Based', 'very', 'first', 'Bond', 'book', 'fast', 'paced', 'high-octane', 'thriller', 'something', 'have', 'not', 'seen', '007', 'film', 'Goldfinger', 'movie', 'movie', 'mean', 'ingredients', 'need', 'make', 'great', 'film', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'shines', 'first', 'very', 'tight', 'brilliantly', 'adult', 'screenplay', 'far', 'most', 'interesting', 'complex', 'thrillers', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'rather', 'tired', 'old', 'comic', 'strip', 'aspects', 'previous', 'Bond', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'swept', 'away', 'outlandish', 'plots', 'old', 'fashioned', 'double', 'entendre', 'used', 'pop', 'screen', 'cartoon', 'bubbles.This', 'Bond', 'witty', 'finer', 'more', 'modern', 'approach', 'truly', 'sophisticated', 'rough', 'edges', 'catch', 'tear', 'ear', 'humor', 'intelligence.Fine', 'direction', 'Martin', 'Campbell', 'action', 'actors', 'ultimately', 'audience', 'new', 'heights', 'action', 'romance', 'most', 'jaw', 'dropping', 'way', 'kill', 'someone', 'not', 'easy', 'messy', 'hard', 'dirty', 'job', 'can', 'get', 'bloody', 'process', 'Bravo', 'putting', 'grit', 'back', 'Bond.Then', 'cast', 'stunning', 'array', 'international', 'talent', 'indeed', 'finest', 'actors', 'today', 'shine', 'sparkle', 'forever', 'diamonds', 'film.Eva', 'Green', 'Vesper', 'Lind', 'far', 'best', 'Bond', 'Girl', 'date', 'actress', 'great', 'range', 'talent', 'Vesper', 'heart', 'stopping', 'life', 'talent', 'combined', 'great', 'writing', 'direction', 'amalgamated', 'film', 'create', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'only', 'fully', 'rounded', 'human', 'Bond', 'Girl', 'ever', 'Mikkelsen', 'astonishingly', 'good', 'villain', 'Le', 'Chiffre', 'real', 'delight', 'watch', 'Dr', 'Evil', 'cold', 'desperate', 'criminal', 'who', 'when', 'cornered', 'liable', 'go', 'nuts', 'you.Here', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'given', 'most', 'complex', 'M', 'date', 'off', 'very', 'special', 'gifts', 'actress', 'always', 'delight', 'film', 'learn', 'few', 'things', 'M', 'might', 'surprise', 'you.Then', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'who', 'debut', 'Bond', 'boy', 'roll', 'red', 'carpet', 'put', 'up', 'velvet', 'performance', 'will', 'bring', 'forefront', 'movie', 'stars', 'who', 'are', 'also', 'exceptional', 'actors', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'act', 'yet', 'never', 'let', 'catch', 'talent', 'top', 'fine', 'actors', 'today', 'such', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'very', 'rough', 'dangerous', 'Bond', 'birth', 'character', 'hot', 'hard', 'thug', 'who', 'course', 'film', 'transformed', 'human', 'design', 'circumstance', 'Bond', 'James', 'Bond', 'simply', 'breathtaking', 'watch.The', 'film', 'brain', 'also', 'hat', 'great', 'thrillers', 'past', 'especially', 'North', 'Northwest', 'exemplified', 'very', 'sexy', 'delightful', 'train', 'scene', 'where', 'Bond', 'Vesper', 'meet', 'first', 'time', 'most', 'surprising', 'aspect', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'how', 'human', 'how', 'heartbreakingly', 'romantic', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'dirty', 'business', 'international', 'espionage.this', 'spcial', 'two', 'disc', 'blue-ray', 'edition', 'stunning', 'behold', 'perfect', 'picture', 'window', 'shattering', 'sound', 'extras', 'are', 'simply', 'grand', 'well.This', 'movie', 'last', 'brings', 'magic', 'back', 'movies', 'heart', 'Bond', 'franchise']",N/A

(I am not sure since I have not yet read the book).There are three highly compelling stunts that far surpass any that I've seen previously in a film.

Gone were the careful headshots of a man who was an expert with his pistol.  Replacing that deadly accuracy was frenetic scenes, random gunfire, and Bond bending the laws of reality.  The Bond films had become a parody of themselves.Enter Casino Royale, which makes up for the shambling travesty that was the Casino Royale Bond spoof.  Daniel Craig takes on the role of Bond as a newbie, a newbie who is a ruthless killer.  Gone are the delicate acrobatics that were the trademark of other Bonds.  This Bond is a hulking brute, smashing through walls, ruthlessly shooting people, and otherwise achieving his missions through sheer brute force. It seems jarring at first, but this is the origin of Bond, from thug to international assassin.The plot, bound by the rules of the original novel, doesn't entirely make sense.  Why the entire world, including both the U.S. and British authorities, feel that beating a criminal at a card game is the best way to coerce him is beyond me.  But if you're willing to buy into that fact (a requisite, really, for the spy genre where nothing is ever so simple and direct) then the film has a certain cadence to it that really enthralls.Until the end.  The part where, we are led to believe, Bond is going to settle down with Vesper Lynd, a treasury agent, in Venice.  Yeah, right.About ten minutes could have been cut from this scene alone.  We get that Bond is enamored with Lynd, that he wants to give it all up for her, but after the torture, the shooting, the gambling, the chasing, the movie becomes something of a snore until it picks up again.  And then we're off to the beginning of another movie, with no resolution whatsoever.Casino Royale is a much improved film, but it's the foundation for the Bond mythology, and as such it breaks previous expectations and struggles to establish new ones. It's much better than the Bond films that went before it, but they set the bar pretty low.  As a book-end to Quantum of Solace, Casino Royale can't be really appreciated without seeing the two movies back-to-back.",3,James Bond: Part I,1228176000,"12 2, 2008",2008,2135,"['interest', 'James', 'Bond', 'died', 'day', 'saw', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'shoot', 'machinegun', 'were', 'careful', 'headshots', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'expert', 'pistol', 'Replacing', 'deadly', 'accuracy', 'was', 'frenetic', 'scenes', 'random', 'gunfire', 'Bond', 'bending', 'laws', 'reality', 'Bond', 'films', 'had', 'become', 'parody', 'themselves.Enter', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'up', 'shambling', 'travesty', 'was', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'Bond', 'spoof', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'role', 'Bond', 'newbie', 'newbie', 'who', 'ruthless', 'killer', 'Gone', 'are', 'delicate', 'acrobatics', 'were', 'trademark', 'other', 'Bonds', 'Bond', 'hulking', 'brute', 'smashing', 'walls', 'ruthlessly', 'shooting', 'people', 'otherwise', 'achieving', 'missions', 'sheer', 'brute', 'force', 'jarring', 'first', 'origin', 'Bond', 'thug', 'international', 'assassin.The', 'plot', 'bound', 'rules', 'original', 'novel', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'make', 'sense', 'Why', 'entire', 'world', 'including', 'U.S.', 'British', 'authorities', 'feel', 'beating', 'criminal', 'card', 'game', 'best', 'way', 'coerce', ""'re"", 'willing', 'buy', 'fact', 'requisite', 'really', 'spy', 'genre', 'where', 'nothing', 'ever', 'so', 'simple', 'direct', 'then', 'film', 'certain', 'cadence', 'really', 'enthralls.Until', 'end', 'part', 'where', 'are', 'led', 'believe', 'Bond', 'going', 'settle', 'down', 'Vesper', 'Lynd', 'treasury', 'agent', 'Venice', 'Yeah', 'right.About', 'ten', 'minutes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'scene', 'alone', 'get', 'Bond', 'enamored', 'Lynd', 'give', 'up', 'torture', 'shooting', 'gambling', 'chasing', 'movie', 'something', 'snore', 'up', 'again', 'then', ""'re"", 'beginning', 'movie', 'resolution', 'whatsoever.Casino', 'Royale', 'much', 'improved', 'film', 'foundation', 'Bond', 'mythology', 'such', 'previous', 'expectations', 'struggles', 'establish', 'new', 'ones', 'much', 'better', 'Bond', 'films', 'went', 'set', 'bar', 'pretty', 'low', 'book-end', 'Quantum', 'Solace', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'really', 'appreciated', 'seeing', 'two', 'movies', 'back-to-back']",N/A

The story is set at the very beginning of Bond's career (he's just been promoted to Double-Oh status) and Daniel Craig is a very believable rough-edged, not entirely self-assured agent who falls in love with a woman he's willing to resign his career for. But since I've seen all or most of the films in the series, beginning with ""Dr. No"" in 1962, continuity dictates that the beginning of Bond's career should logically have been set during the Cold War of the late 1950s -- not in the 21st century world of terrorism, cell phones, and Texas Hold'Em. (The original novel, of course, was set even earlier, in 1953.) It's as if the previous films in the franchise didn't exist. The stunts and the chase scenes are great and there's relatively little reliance on bizarre spy technology (except for a suspiciously convenient defibrilator in the gove compartment), and the relationships are key to the story for a change. And the parkour chase sequence in Madagascar was amazing, as was the the building-collapse scene in Venice. Even the open credit sequence was much more restrained than usual. Finally, the only really familiar face among the cast is Judi Dench as a very tough ""M,"" which allows the story to take precedence over the actors. Mads Mikkelsen is especially creepy as Le Chiffre, and Eva Green (as Vesper Lynd) and Caterina Murino (as Solange) are sufficiently attractive without being Barbie Dolls.

Yes, Daniel Craig does an excellent job portraying a darker, grittier, more cynical James Bond that we're used to.  And yes, the first half of the movie is entertaining (if you'll suspend your disbelief during the truly absurd chase scene at the beginning).  But then, things rapidly fall apart.How many movies have we seen now in which the hero's only recourse is to engage his arch-nemesis in a pulse-pounding... er, poker game?  And how many times are we going to be handed a villain who is supposed to be a poker-master, yet displays incredibly obvious ""tells"" (aka physical giveaways of the kind of hand he or she is holding)?And as for the last twenty minutes of this movie, to call them predictable would be, well, predictable.  The problem is that the movie-makers simply don't understand their own character.  Suddenly, they change gears and make Craig's raw, gritty, cynical Bond behave like a lovesick teenager.  Which ends exactly how you'd expect it to end.Oh, and one more thing...

Bond's long history of womanizing (although the 'manizing' of the many Bond girls is deemed acceptable in the hypocrisy of political correctness, Hollywood-style) was finally punished in this film, with amongst other things, a flogging on the genitals, to the delight of many it seems. Previous Bonds had broken every rule in the book of today's gender rules for films, especially the rule that a woman must always get the comeuppance over a man. If a man uses a woman, he must somehow be punished at the end of the film. If a woman uses a man, there must be a good reason for her doing it, and it's probably because he's a bastard. Bond broke this golden rule for nearly 4 decades, and now poor old Daniel Craig (who plays his role as well as could be done considering the script he had to accept) is paying for this with genital floggings and other humiliations no other Bond would have dreamed of accepting. This is NOT Bond. It's just the typical, routine modern action film, politically-corrected to match today's bogus gender ideology, and can only really be enjoyed by certain kinds of women and emasculated men, the type who've unconsciously accepted psychological castration. This would be perfectly OK if we also saw films of Charlie's Angels, for example, getting floggings on their genitals, as then men would know that Hollywood does promote real gender equality.

The fact that Fleming had knowledge of how a spy REALLY worked was one of those things.  The other was he was also able to make his main character, the brutal OO7, James Bond, as close to reality as he could.  Mr. Bond was NOT a nice character, even if he was fighting, or should I say killing, for the good guys.  Outside of those two points the rest of the book, from plot to the very flow of the scenes, pretty much sucked.  But it was his first book and his craft approved slightly with each new story.When the movies picked up the James Bond stories, mostly because JFK was reading them, they gave James Bond high-tech weapons, took away his rough and gritty soul, and gave him a sense of humor.  They also did what they did best - they made everything look great, from the fast cars to the glowing cities and sexy women James Bond would encounter, and use, on the way.  They also took his treatment of women and tuned it down a few levels.  They changed him into a spy totally removed from the reality of the Cold War or, at least, the Cold War of the books.Now they brought the James Bond from the books, they picked a story they could work on and approve BECAUSE it was so weak, and they tuned down the high-tech stuff.  They created, in my view, the best James Bond movie ever.  Daniel Craig is a ruthless Bond, Judi Dench is a cold and logical M, and even Eva Green plays a hard but also troubled Vesper.  From the opening black and white flashback to the closing, old fashion, theme song you CAN'T keep your eyes off the screen.The extras are nice, from behind the scene features to a special on James Bond Girls and even the Chris Cornell Music Video.  I can't wait for the next movie.

I've loved 007 films for years and I admit the last two that where made where CGI overkill and not a top film, but all it needed was a better director and scriptwriters.So they come up with the idea to jump on the Batman Begins wagon and re-invent something that wasn't broken?When I first saw the preview/trailer of this, and hearing about this as being a prequel, I saw an instant mistake when Judy Dench was shown as being M in the film. A prequel that ignores the fact that she wasn't the original M character, she took over as M in Goldeneye(or one of the Brosnon ones) because the Original M died or retired or something and she was next in line, or the wife or something, I dunno, but the point is she wasn't there in the beginning. And the excuse I heard was that this isn't a prequel, its a complete restart like Batman Begins. OK, I let that one slip by and ended up seeing the film.The start of the film bored the hell out of me, it was so slow, and dragged, and didn't even show how Bond became a double-0 agent, it's more like starting from his first day AS a 00. Then the rest of the film lagged and then action, then bore, then action, then lag, then bore then action, then what, then zzzzz, then ""so that's it then is it?""As I said, being a Bond fan for over 20 movies, why try and fix what's not broken? This film is not a Bond film, it just has the character names, the 00 status and the theme music, and the theme music of the trademark guitar theme didn't even get played in the movie, it was just used in the closing credits.How can you call this a Bond film when you have Dr Who not fitting into the spot of a Bond type, men aren't my thing, but I cant imagine women seeing him as charming and sophisticated with a license to thrill them.Amongst everything else, no Q, no gadgets, no charm, not the right kind of smartarse replies expected from a Bond, no Money Penny, and he's gone from what we know Bond as to more of a dull egotistical and boring character that acts more depressing then anything else.I don't get it, I really don't understand how any fans of Bond could seriously see this as a decent Bond film? I'd probably think it was an average and forgetful film if it was titled something else and didn't use the Bond names and trademarks, but this will never be accepted by me as a Bond film.I honestly can't believe that only a small majority of reviewers have seen the movie the way I did. Either the world had gone mad, or there is only reviews being written by people who have never seen a Bond film before because all the ones who have are still in shock, puking in the car park or still at the ticket office demanding a refund.R.I.P James Bond (1962-2006)",1,Why try to fix whats not broken?,1165622400,"12 9, 2006",2006,2756,"['can', 'not', 'understand', 'anybody', 'reason', 'praising', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'loved', '007', 'films', 'years', 'admit', 'last', 'two', 'where', 'made', 'where', 'CGI', 'overkill', 'not', 'top', 'film', 'needed', 'was', 'better', 'director', 'scriptwriters.So', 'come', 'up', 'idea', 'jump', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'wagon', 're-invent', 'something', 'was', ""n't"", 'broken', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'preview/trailer', 'hearing', 'about', 'being', 'prequel', 'saw', 'instant', 'mistake', 'when', 'Judy', 'Dench', 'was', 'shown', 'being', 'M', 'film', 'prequel', 'fact', 'was', ""n't"", 'original', 'M', 'character', 'took', 'over', 'M', 'Goldeneye', 'one', 'Brosnon', 'ones', 'Original', 'M', 'died', 'retired', 'something', 'was', 'next', 'line', 'wife', 'something', 'dunno', 'point', 'was', ""n't"", 'there', 'beginning', 'excuse', 'heard', 'was', ""n't"", 'prequel', 'complete', 'restart', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'OK', 'let', 'one', 'slip', 'ended', 'up', 'seeing', 'film.The', 'start', 'film', 'bored', 'hell', 'was', 'so', 'slow', 'dragged', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'show', 'how', 'Bond', 'became', 'double-0', 'agent', 'more', 'starting', 'first', 'day', '00', 'Then', 'rest', 'film', 'lagged', 'then', 'action', 'then', 'bore', 'then', 'action', 'then', 'lag', 'then', 'bore', 'then', 'action', 'then', 'what', 'then', 'zzzzz', 'then', 'so', 'then', 'said', 'being', 'Bond', 'fan', '20', 'movies', 'why', 'try', 'fix', 'what', 'not', 'broken', 'film', 'not', 'Bond', 'film', 'just', 'character', 'names', '00', 'status', 'theme', 'music', 'theme', 'music', 'trademark', 'guitar', 'theme', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'played', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'used', 'closing', 'credits.How', 'can', 'call', 'Bond', 'film', 'when', 'have', 'Dr', 'Who', 'not', 'fitting', 'spot', 'Bond', 'type', 'men', 'are', ""n't"", 'thing', 'cant', 'imagine', 'women', 'seeing', 'charming', 'sophisticated', 'license', 'thrill', 'them.Amongst', 'everything', 'else', 'Q', 'gadgets', 'charm', 'not', 'right', 'kind', 'smartarse', 'replies', 'expected', 'Bond', 'Money', 'Penny', 'gone', 'what', 'know', 'Bond', 'more', 'dull', 'egotistical', 'boring', 'character', 'more', 'depressing', 'then', 'anything', 'else.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'how', 'fans', 'Bond', 'could', 'seriously', 'see', 'decent', 'Bond', 'film', ""'d"", 'probably', 'think', 'was', 'average', 'forgetful', 'film', 'was', 'titled', 'something', 'else', 'did', ""n't"", 'use', 'Bond', 'names', 'trademarks', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'accepted', 'Bond', 'film.I', 'honestly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'only', 'small', 'majority', 'reviewers', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'way', 'did', 'world', 'had', 'gone', 'mad', 'only', 'reviews', 'being', 'written', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'Bond', 'film', 'ones', 'who', 'have', 'are', 'still', 'shock', 'puking', 'car', 'park', 'still', 'ticket', 'office', 'demanding', 'refund.R.I.P', 'James', 'Bond', '1962-2006']",N/A

Beck ""Always the Devourer of Good...","[1, 2]","I must first say that I was ""extremely reluctant"" to accept Daniel Craig into my heart as the infamous, sexy and dangerous 007. I was very upset when they decided that Pierce Brosnan would not be back. A little history....I was a BIG Sean Connery fan, and could not stand Roger Moore or the other Bonds until Brosnan. He had most of the qualities that I feel Sean Connery has......he is suave, charming, handsome and a little mysterious/dangerous...and James Bond use to be Remington Steele.  So, needless to say I didn't want another 007, just when I got use to this one. So imagine my attitude when I went to see this movie.......Daniel Craig was going to be critiqued harshly. Now with all that in mind, I must say I was pleasantly pleased. Although Daniel Craig's was 007, his spin on the character was completely different. And although he was not as suave as Sean Connery, he is just as romantic (Vesper love story crucial to the story), more so because he only tried to get with two women, versus a ton (each critical to the story).  And more than anything, he was more believable than past Bonds. He would bleed, he got hurt, he was sensitive and completely human.This movie was great....the plot is well written, you love to hate the bad guy, you feel sorry for the hero, and I found myself beginning to embrace him as 007. I no longer view 007 as a ""single"" person, while for some reason in the past it seemed like writers wanted us to think of Connery, Moore, and Brosnan, as the same person.  But now, I have come to see the title of 007 as a classification, similar to the position of Inspector and Detective. And I really found myself appreciating the fact that this Bond was so human.

The well-done opening title sequence (interestingly, no nude women but you don't miss them) with it's somewhat retro artwork combined with the best theme song (by Chris Cornell - his voice sounding better than I've ever heard it sound - alternately warm and majestically screechy) since You Only Live Twice or Nobody Does It Better immediately hooks you.Next, I was completely impressed with Daniel Craig. Yes, at times his face does convey a certain unBondian goofyness. But you get over that right away after the stirring opening chase scene. Craig is no soft, pretty boy Roger Moore type*. He's athletic, built like a prize fighter, and viscious. For the first half of the movie, he's like Seattle Slew as a colt - inexperienced, cocky and naive - but you know he's going to win the Derby some day. And the Derby ends by the time the last scene plays - at which time I let out an audible ""woo!"" and ""yeah, baby!"" - even though I watched the DVD alone.This movie succeeds on so many levels. It convincingly portrays Bond before he became the icon. The action sequences and location shooting are top notch. The villian is as creepy and reptilian as any previous foe. The love story between Bond and Vesper progresses expertly and is quite moving (and unexpected). But Daniel Craig stole the show and by the time the movie ended, I was immediately thirsting for the next Craig-helmed Bond flick.At the end of the closing credits, the producers promise that ""JAMES BOND WILL RETURN."" Can't wait.* Don't get me wrong: I loved most of the somewhat campy but fun and exciting Moore-era Bond movies.

1048558,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B000MNP2K8,mirasreviews,"[3, 5]","""Casino Royale"" is the 21st movie in the James Bond franchise, and, for the first time since 1987's ""The Living Daylights"", it is based on one of Ian Fleming's novels. Loosely. The same book, the first of Fleming's Bond novels, inspired the 1967 spoof of the spy flick genre, also called ""Casino Royale"". I haven't seen that film, and it's been so long since I read Fleming's book that I barely remember it. But I can say that, in addition to moving the story beyond the Cold War and reinterpreting the Bond character, this film is more convoluted than the novel that inspired it. ""Casino Royale"" reinvents the James Bond franchise by moving away from the quasi-sci-fi, somewhat hokey technoterrorism of 2002's ""Die Another Day"" and toward a grittier world of death-defying hand-to-hand combat almost completely unaided by unusual gadgetry.Shortly after receiving his ""00"" status, or license to kill, British superspy James Bond (Daniel Craig) makes a spectacle of shooting up an embassy and an unarmed bombmaker in Madagascar. Annoyed by his politically embarrassing bravado and intent on cornering the banker to many of the world's terrorist organizations, a man called Le Chiffre, British spy chief ""M"" (Judi Dench) sets Bond lose to track down Le Chiffre's clients and create financial pressure that will force him to turn to MI6 for amnesty. This culminates in a high-stakes poker game in Montenegro, where Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen) must recoup his recent losses in order to cover his clients' investments. The British government sets Bond up with a $10 million stake, watched over by sharp, curvaceous treasury agent Vesper Lynd (Eva Green), with orders to clean Le Chiffre out.We won't know for sure until a few more Bond films have been produced, but ""Casino Royale"" appears to be a major turning point in the franchise. It has jettisoned ""Q"", Miss Moneypenny, and gadgets-to-the-rescue. Moreover, Daniel Craig's James Bond is a huge departure from previous interpretations. Where Sean Connery's Bond was a smug playboy, Roger Moore's effete, and Pierce Brosnan's politically correct, this new Bond is a sociopathic automaton. I'm not sure what this says about today's ideals. Bond is reckless as always. But he has more contempt than desire for women. He's an unquestioning soldier, not a stylish individualist. He acts as if he's been programmed, a relentless and unfeeling machine with the odd lapse into cloying sentimentality. His detachment is perversely captivating, but if Bond is going to be this dark, I might have preferred Clive Owen in the role.""Casino Royale"" is an energetic and strangely seductive movie whose strength lies in its exoticism, immediacy, and careful pacing, not in Bond's charisma, action sequences, or Bond girls. The action sequences are the film's lows. A 9-minute chase goes past the point of dull and keeps on going. Adventures in Uganda, Madagascar, Nassau, and Miami that involve Le Chiffre's clients are tangential and cause the movie to run nearly 2 1/2 hours. They exist to provide eye candy and action at regular intervals. This works, but it complicates the plot to the extent that I must conclude that the plot does not matter. Le Chiffre seems to run a hedge fund for monied revolutionaries who manipulate stock prices with terrorist acts while he sells the stocks short. He is effectively an insider trader. Again, I'm not sure what this says about today's anxieties. ""Casino Royale""'s plot, from its financial chicanery to its inscrutable and invisible villain ""Mr. White"", does not make sense. I can't excuse the sloppy writing, but ""Casino Royale"" is a pivotal Bond film with almost enough thrills and intrigue to entertain for its unprecedented 2 hour 24 minute running time.",4,James Bond Radically Reconceived.,1173916800,"03 15, 2007",2007,3735,"['Casino', 'Royale', '21st', 'movie', 'James', 'Bond', 'franchise', 'first', 'time', '1987', 'Living', 'Daylights', 'based', 'one', 'Ian', 'Fleming', 'novels', 'Loosely', 'same', 'book', 'first', 'Fleming', 'Bond', 'novels', 'inspired', '1967', 'spoof', 'spy', 'flick', 'genre', 'also', 'called', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'been', 'so', 'long', 'read', 'Fleming', 'book', 'barely', 'remember', 'can', 'say', 'addition', 'moving', 'story', 'Cold', 'War', 'reinterpreting', 'Bond', 'character', 'film', 'more', 'convoluted', 'novel', 'inspired', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'James', 'Bond', 'franchise', 'moving', 'away', 'quasi-sci-fi', 'somewhat', 'hokey', 'technoterrorism', '2002', 'Die', 'Day', 'grittier', 'world', 'death-defying', 'hand-to-hand', 'combat', 'almost', 'completely', 'unaided', 'unusual', 'gadgetry.Shortly', 'receiving', '00', 'status', 'license', 'kill', 'British', 'superspy', 'James', 'Bond', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'spectacle', 'shooting', 'up', 'embassy', 'unarmed', 'bombmaker', 'Madagascar', 'Annoyed', 'politically', 'embarrassing', 'bravado', 'intent', 'cornering', 'banker', 'many', 'world', 'terrorist', 'organizations', 'man', 'called', 'Le', 'Chiffre', 'British', 'spy', 'chief', 'M', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Bond', 'lose', 'track', 'down', 'Le', 'Chiffre', 'clients', 'create', 'financial', 'pressure', 'will', 'force', 'turn', 'MI6', 'amnesty', 'high-stakes', 'poker', 'game', 'Montenegro', 'where', 'Le', 'Chiffre', 'Mads', 'Mikkelsen', 'must', 'recoup', 'recent', 'losses', 'order', 'cover', 'clients', 'investments', 'British', 'government', 'sets', 'Bond', 'up', '10', 'million', 'stake', 'watched', 'sharp', 'curvaceous', 'treasury', 'agent', 'Vesper', 'Lynd', 'Eva', 'Green', 'orders', 'clean', 'Le', 'Chiffre', 'out.We', 'wo', ""n't"", 'know', 'sure', 'few', 'more', 'Bond', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'produced', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'be', 'major', 'turning', 'point', 'franchise', 'jettisoned', 'Q', 'Miss', 'Moneypenny', 'gadgets-to-the-rescue', 'Moreover', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'James', 'Bond', 'huge', 'departure', 'previous', 'interpretations', 'Where', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'Bond', 'was', 'smug', 'playboy', 'Roger', 'Moore', 'effete', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'politically', 'correct', 'new', 'Bond', 'sociopathic', 'automaton', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'today', 'ideals', 'Bond', 'reckless', 'always', 'more', 'contempt', 'desire', 'women', 'unquestioning', 'soldier', 'not', 'stylish', 'individualist', 'been', 'programmed', 'relentless', 'unfeeling', 'machine', 'odd', 'lapse', 'cloying', 'sentimentality', 'detachment', 'perversely', 'captivating', 'Bond', 'going', 'be', 'dark', 'might', 'have', 'preferred', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'role', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'energetic', 'strangely', 'seductive', 'movie', 'strength', 'exoticism', 'immediacy', 'careful', 'pacing', 'not', 'Bond', 'charisma', 'action', 'sequences', 'Bond', 'girls', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'film', 'lows', '9-minute', 'chase', 'point', 'dull', 'keeps', 'going', 'Adventures', 'Uganda', 'Madagascar', 'Nassau', 'Miami', 'involve', 'Le', 'Chiffre', 'clients', 'are', 'tangential', 'cause', 'movie', 'run', 'nearly', '2', '1/2', 'hours', 'exist', 'provide', 'eye', 'candy', 'action', 'regular', 'intervals', 'plot', 'extent', 'must', 'conclude', 'plot', 'not', 'matter', 'Le', 'Chiffre', 'run', 'hedge', 'fund', 'monied', 'revolutionaries', 'who', 'manipulate', 'stock', 'prices', 'terrorist', 'acts', 'stocks', 'short', 'effectively', 'insider', 'trader', 'Again', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'today', 'anxieties', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'plot', 'financial', 'chicanery', 'inscrutable', 'invisible', 'villain', 'Mr.', 'White', 'not', 'make', 'sense', 'ca', ""n't"", 'excuse', 'sloppy', 'writing', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'pivotal', 'Bond', 'film', 'almost', 'enough', 'thrills', 'intrigue', 'entertain', 'unprecedented', '2', 'hour', '24', 'minute', 'running', 'time']",N/A
1048559,A34X9EZTTQR7R7,B000MNP2K8,"MK ""Hussar""","[3, 6]","An artful turn of phrase, an upturned eyebrow, and a casual air in the midst of a deadly situation means only one thing:  James Bond has returned.  Curiously absent on the big screen for the last half-decade, the famous, womanizing MI6 agent ignited the fires of controversy--off-screen for a change--when gossip-mongers discovered that the actor cast for the role would be, gasp, blond.  Luckily, the producers and directors of ""Casino Royale"" forged ahead regardless, giving actor Daniel Craig (""Layer Cake"") a chance to prove his worth.  The short version of this review would be that he succeeded spectacularly; further, he was working with one of the best scripts the series has had in years.  The long version of this review, as befits this reviewer's compulsion, will continue below.By the mid-to-late 1980's, fans were beginning to view the franchise in a light similar to how nearly all Americans viewed ""SNL"" since the seventies--as a once-great thing long past its peak.  Then, ""Goldeneye"" was released, and new life entered the series as a new generation was indoctrinated into the cult of the Sultan of Suave.  Pierce Brosnan was the new captain, but even his brave leadership couldn't save future episodes (""Tomorrow Never Dies,"" ""The World is Not Enough,"" and ""Die Another Day"") from being simply okay at best, and silly at worst.  Another idea floating around is the somewhat specious view that the ""Austin Powers"" franchise diminished Fleming's cinematic translations.  This is convenient in that blame is removed from the producers, writers, and directors of the Bond films, which was probably the entire reason for forwarding such as ridiculous idea in the first place.  Regardless, the series was far past the time for something new--director Martin Campbell (""Goldeneye,"" ""Beyond Borders"") proves far more than capable at injecting a little modernity into the aging series.  Ironically, he pulls this off by starting at the beginning:  the beginning of Bond's ""00"" career, of Fleming's novels, and of the agent's descent into total emotional detachment.  Campbell is not above resurrecting a few ideas and scenes from past ""Bond"" films--several of which may be lost of today's audience--but the overall effect still feels remarkably fresh.Everything chic and hip happens in Prague, so naturally that is exactly where Bond earns his ""00"" status.  He kills Dryden, a regional MI6 section chief who has been appropriating extra funds illegally.  After obtaining his promotion to ""007"" designation, we find James on surveillance duty in Madagascar.  His partner bungles his cover and is made by the target, prompting the movie's first chase sequence.  Chasing his acrobatic quarry through construction sites and city streets, James is finally able to corner him in an embassy.  Interested only in the target's bag, Bond kills the man and blows up most of the embassy in what must be the world's most elaborate distractionary gambit.  Finding a text message which says only ""ellipsis,"" he begins on a journey to unravel a tangled web consisting of international crime syndicates, stock market manipulation, and Le Chiffre, (Mads Mikkelsen, ""King Arthur"") a banker who finances terror.  Along the pathway to illumination, James finds time to play perhaps the largest-stake Texas Hold `em game ever, win the heart of Vesper Lynd (Eva Green), hack into M's personal computer account, and seduce a vixen after first stripping her husband...of several thousand dollars, his pride, and his classic Aston Martin, that is.This film shows the filmmaker's desire to reinvent the franchise.  ""Casino Royale"" was Fleming's first novel, and this movie seeks to similarly begin a new Bond continuum, with no relation to prior films in the series.  As such, Craig's Bond is permitted to be shown as a flawed, vulnerable, and green agent who does not yet bear the scars of cumulative experiences.  He is recognizable as the agent we know--brash, arrogant, ruthless, and philandering--but seems to almost be the adolescent version of later manifestations.  The deep wound he sustains by the conclusion of ""Casino Royale"" may provide the viewer with a sense of why his later versions seemed so apathetic and aloof regarding--supposedly--key emotions like compassion, love, and honor.  Prior to this film, the character of Bond seemed axiomatic:  he simply was, and he was not a result of anything.  Perhaps the success of this movie over its predecessors is partially due to better audience identification with the main character--it's easier to root for someone that you identify as human.Forget the character, for this is a Bond movie, right?  That means blazing action sequences, smoldering women, hotter cars, technobabble, and cutting wisecracks garnished with the perfect martini to most fans.  Fans need not fear to the slightest degree.  Two of the chase sequences had my wife suspecting that I'd prefer a seat inside the screen, so riveted by the onscreen action was I.  I'll never view an airplane refueling truck the same way again.  Solange (Caterina Murino) heats up the screen with vibrant Mediterranean allure, probably causing most male viewers to miss the gist of several lines of dialogue.  However, Eva Green as Vesper succeeds in taking first prize in the sex appeal department--despite a rather mousy appearance--via simple combination:  presence, presence, and presence.  The unspoken suggestion present in every line of dialogue between her and James is hotter than even Solange's bikini-on-horseback scene.  Aston Martin brings several representative vehicles into the film--one car being most unfortunate, more's the pity.  Speaking of Bond's Aston Martin, it conveniently comes equipped with cardiac defibrillator, chemical blood analyzer, silenced pistol, and GPS locator, so technophiles everywhere should be assuaged their concerns.  Finally, James Bond--even as an agent just starting out--achieves a sum total of wit in one half sentence which most people aspire to in their entire lives.  He even manages to be witty without actually uttering an entire phrase--as an audience, we so easily accept his innate verve that we are willing to forgive him such extraneous matters as actually finishing the witty sentence.  In summary, 007 is supernaturally charming, capable, lucky, desirable, and macho, but this time, he's human, too.The movie had me chuckling from the moment Le Chiffre first took a puff from his silver inhaler to when Craig finally uttered the immortal introduction.  The tension was present from the bathroom brawl to the final confrontation in a doomed building.  The conspiracy runs deep and the movie may require several viewing before a viewer feels comfortable with the plot; however, the story does not end with the credits.  Fans of ""Dr. No"" will note a playfully inverted take on perhaps the most famous Bond girl introduction scene of all time.  ""Casino Royale"" is only the first movie of a planned trilogy, (the second film, ""Quantum of Solace,"" was out last fall) so expect even more character development, as opposed to what you may be familiar with:  an indestructible, unaltered agent who operates in a vacuum, without memory or care of past events.  This movie is highly recommended for those interested in seeing both Bond's best film and Bond's best actor--and yes, I'm including Sean Connery amongst that list.",5,"The best Bond thus far:  two

From the opening moments of ""Casino Royale"" when still rising British Agent James bond (Craig) earns his stripes with two calculated murders, it is clear  that the Bond franchise has rediscovered itself, going back to fundamentals and delivering the most exciting and engrossing Bond film since Sean Connery squared off against a certain deranged businessman with an affinity for gold.  Craig, a seasoned character actor with superstar charisma and animal magnetism to burn, is ideally suited for the restart.  His rough-hewn good looks and gruff demeanor perfectly accentuate this early Bond, who is still trying to channel his anger, aggression and recklessness into the suave charisma and ruthlessly lethal efficiency that a spy needs to survive.  But beyond the superficial, Craig's acting chops are formidable, and he rips into Bond with an intelligence and gusto not seen since Connery.  In fact, Craig may now have outdone Connery, but it will remain to be seen if Craig can muster Connery's consistency.However, the Bond series has been known to shoot itself in the foot with stiff, static writing and insipid direction (exibit A and B: ""A View to a Kill"" and ""The World is not Enough,"" along with numerous others).  But, for ""Royale,"" the franchise stewards Barbara Broccoli and Michael Wilson wooed back Director Martin Campbell from ""Goldeneye"" as well as screenwriter Paul Haggis (Crash) to spice up the script by Bond vets Neal Purvis and Robert Wade.  As a result, the writing is astronomically better than it has been in years, refreshingly devoid of cop-out puns and instead chock full of textured dialouge and biting back and forth banter (check the first interplay between Craig and Eva Green, the smartest and strongest Bond girl in years).  Haggis and co. also seem to have taken notes from Matt Damons' ""Bourne"" series, realizing that a touch of humanity and reality to the saga of a super-spy goes a long way in enriching character.  They allow Craig and Green to be vulnerable, terrified, and even a little bumbling in the face of the cool, demented and blood-stained eyes of Le Chiffe (Mads Mikkelson), a renegade finacier of terror who uses his clients assets to bankroll a high-rolling poker game and play the stock market, albeit with perfectly placed terrorist attacks of his own to push the market just the right way.  Director Campbell, whose work since ""Goldeneye"" has been spotty to say the least (Vertical Limit, Beyond Borders), is reenergized on ""Royale,"" his style and confidence rekindled.  He, along with cinematographer Phil Meheaux (The Mask of Zorro) and editor Stuart Baird (A Richard Donner favorite), uncork their shared prowess and deliver a whirlwind of bone-crunching action scenes both small (the opening bathroom brawl between Bond and his first kill) to gigantic.  The foot chase up and down a construction site in Madagascar between Bond and a ridiculously athletic bomb-making terrorist is a show-stopper, as is the finale in a collapsing Venetian mansion.  What this adds up to is that ""Casino Royale"" ranks as one of the best Bond films of all time, but it also ranks as the best action film of the year.  Hell, it may end of being one of the best films of the year.",5,"Daniel Craig Shines in the Best Bond Since ""Goldfinger""",1163808000,"11 18, 2006",2006,3375,"['Gone', 'now', 'least', 'are', 'rediculous', 'gadgets', 'cornball', 'puns', 'outsized', 'plots', 'meant', 'disguise', 'fact', 'series', 'had', 'little', 'left', 'offer', 'opening', 'moments', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'when', 'still', 'rising', 'British', 'Agent', 'James', 'bond', 'Craig', 'stripes', 'two', 'calculated', 'murders', 'clear', 'Bond', 'franchise', 'rediscovered', 'going', 'back', 'fundamentals', 'delivering', 'most', 'exciting', 'engrossing', 'Bond', 'film', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'squared', 'off', 'certain', 'deranged', 'businessman', 'affinity', 'gold', 'Craig', 'seasoned', 'character', 'actor', 'superstar', 'charisma', 'animal', 'magnetism', 'burn', 'ideally', 'suited', 'restart', 'rough-hewn', 'good', 'looks', 'gruff', 'demeanor', 'perfectly', 'accentuate', 'early', 'Bond', 'who', 'still', 'trying', 'channel', 'anger', 'aggression', 'recklessness', 'suave', 'charisma', 'ruthlessly', 'lethal', 'efficiency', 'spy', 'survive', 'superficial', 'Craig', 'acting', 'chops', 'are', 'formidable', 'Bond', 'intelligence', 'gusto', 'not', 'seen', 'Connery', 'fact', 'Craig', 'may', 'now', 'have', 'outdone', 'Connery', 'will', 'remain', 'be', 'seen', 'Craig', 'can', 'muster', 'Connery', 'consistency.However', 'Bond', 'series', 'been', 'known', 'shoot', 'foot', 'stiff', 'static', 'writing', 'insipid', 'direction', 'exibit', 'B', 'View', 'Kill', 'World', 'not', 'Enough', 'numerous', 'others', 'Royale', 'franchise', 'stewards', 'Barbara', 'Broccoli', 'Michael', 'Wilson', 'wooed', 'back', 'Director', 'Martin', 'Campbell', 'Goldeneye', 'as', 'well', 'screenwriter', 'Paul', 'Haggis', 'Crash', 'spice', 'up', 'script', 'Bond', 'vets', 'Neal', 'Purvis', 'Robert', 'Wade', 'result', 'writing', 'astronomically', 'better', 'been', 'years', 'refreshingly', 'devoid', 'cop-out', 'puns', 'instead', 'chock', 'full', 'textured', 'dialouge', 'biting', 'back', 'forth', 'banter', 'check', 'first', 'interplay', 'Craig', 'Eva', 'Green', 'smartest', 'strongest', 'Bond', 'girl', 'years', 'Haggis', 'co.', 'also', 'seem', 'have', 'taken', 'notes', 'Matt', 'Damons', 'Bourne', 'series', 'realizing', 'touch', 'humanity', 'reality', 'saga', 'super-spy', 'long', 'way', 'enriching', 'character', 'allow', 'Craig', 'Green', 'be', 'vulnerable', 'terrified', 'even', 'little', 'bumbling', 'face', 'cool', 'demented', 'blood-stained', 'eyes', 'Le', 'Chiffe', 'Mads', 'Mikkelson', 'renegade', 'finacier', 'terror', 'who', 'clients', 'assets', 'bankroll', 'high-rolling', 'poker', 'game', 'play', 'stock', 'market', 'perfectly', 'placed', 'terrorist', 'attacks', 'own', 'push', 'market', 'just', 'right', 'way', 'Director', 'Campbell', 'work', 'Goldeneye', 'been', 'spotty', 'say', 'least', 'Vertical', 'Limit', 'Beyond', 'Borders', 'reenergized', 'Royale', 'style', 'confidence', 'rekindled', 'cinematographer', 'Phil', 'Meheaux', 'Mask', 'Zorro', 'editor', 'Stuart', 'Baird', 'A', 'Richard', 'Donner', 'favorite', 'uncork', 'shared', 'prowess', 'deliver', 'whirlwind', 'bone-crunching', 'action', 'scenes', 'small', 'opening', 'bathroom', 'brawl', 'Bond', 'first', 'kill', 'gigantic', 'foot', 'chase', 'up', 'construction', 'site', 'Madagascar', 'Bond', 'ridiculously', 'athletic', 'bomb-making', 'terrorist', 'show-stopper', 'finale', 'collapsing', 'Venetian', 'mansion', 'What', 'up', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'one', 'best', 'Bond', 'films', 'time', 'also', 'best', 'action', 'film', 'year', 'Hell', 'may', 'end', 'being', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'year']",N/A

You're probably shaking your head at this point wondering why a self-proclaimed ""movie-buff"" hadn't seen a Bond film in her 28 years of life, but I just hadn't. I tend to avoid the big Hollywood Blockbuster movies (ie. Batman, Superman, Spiderman etc.) and am typically more into independent and/or ""artsy"" films, but I do enjoy good action/adventure as well. Not to say Bond films fall into the Hollywood Blockbuster category, however, the ones made in the last decade or so have been hyped up by Hollywood with much with so much pomp and circumstance, its actually kept me away from the theater.Regardless, I decided to ""cave in"" and rent Casino Royale when home for two weeks with pneumonia simply because I had exausted every other film in Blockbuster Video, and I was extremely surprised and impressed with the movie, so much so that I have now rented and seen most of the earlier Bond films. At this juncture, I feel I can finally submit my opinion that Daniel Craig IS the ultimate Bond! He was much more subtle than the other actors who played the coveted role, and defintiely much more manly, believeable and ""cool"" than Pierce Brosnsan who starred in the last few ones.The film was awesome (for lack of a better word): amazing special effects, quality acting, a great plot and twists and turns galore....pretty much a perfect movie (let alone a perfect ""Bond movie"").Despite being the first Bond film I've seen, its defintiely my favorite and I can't wait for Bond 22 (as yet untitled, I believe) to come out with Daniel Craig.I HIGHLY recommend owning this amazing film and adding it to your Bond collection- its worth every penny and then some!",5,"It seems that when it comes to Bond, everyone has a favorite.....",1177632000,"04 27, 2007",2007,1841,"['his/her', 'favorite', 'Bond', 'film', 'favorite', 'Bond', 'actor', 'bound', 'be', 'disagreement.I', 'will', 'admit', 'was', 'first', 'Bond', 'film', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', ""'re"", 'probably', 'shaking', 'head', 'point', 'wondering', 'why', 'self-proclaimed', 'movie-buff', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Bond', 'film', '28', 'years', 'life', 'just', 'had', ""n't"", 'tend', 'avoid', 'big', 'Hollywood', 'Blockbuster', 'movies', 'ie', 'Batman', 'Superman', 'Spiderman', 'etc', 'am', 'typically', 'more', 'independent', 'artsy', 'films', 'do', 'enjoy', 'good', 'action/adventure', 'well', 'Not', 'say', 'Bond', 'films', 'fall', 'Hollywood', 'Blockbuster', 'category', 'however', 'ones', 'made', 'last', 'decade', 'so', 'have', 'been', 'hyped', 'up', 'Hollywood', 'much', 'so', 'much', 'pomp', 'circumstance', 'actually', 'kept', 'away', 'theater.Regardless', 'decided', 'cave', 'rent', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'when', 'home', 'two', 'weeks', 'pneumonia', 'simply', 'had', 'exausted', 'other', 'film', 'Blockbuster', 'Video', 'was', 'extremely', 'surprised', 'impressed', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'have', 'now', 'rented', 'seen', 'most', 'earlier', 'Bond', 'films', 'juncture', 'feel', 'can', 'finally', 'submit', 'opinion', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'ultimate', 'Bond', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'subtle', 'other', 'actors', 'who', 'played', 'coveted', 'role', 'defintiely', 'much', 'more', 'manly', 'believeable', 'cool', 'Pierce', 'Brosnsan', 'who', 'starred', 'last', 'few', 'ones.The', 'film', 'was', 'awesome', 'lack', 'better', 'word', 'amazing', 'special', 'effects', 'quality', 'acting', 'great', 'plot', 'twists', 'galore', '.pretty', 'much', 'perfect', 'movie', 'let', 'alone', 'perfect', 'Bond', 'movie', '.Despite', 'being', 'first', 'Bond', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'defintiely', 'favorite', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'Bond', '22', 'yet', 'untitled', 'believe', 'come', 'out', 'Daniel', 'Craig.I', 'HIGHLY', 'recommend', 'owning', 'amazing', 'film', 'adding', 'Bond', 'collection-', 'worth', 'penny', 'then']",N/A

The curiosity factor was high when I wandered off to see ""Casino Royale"".Was Craig as good as some of the other Bond actors? No, simply put. However, this was his first Bond movie, and I think an actor of his skill will quickly gain a feel for his own interpretation of the character. Craig brings a certain ruthlessness to the role, and a gritty earthiness. Without the vast array of nifty gadgets, Bond is finally relying on his wits. Breaking into M's home was a nice touch.Balanced with that is Bond's sensitive side. I do not ever recall Bond falling in love before. The vulnerability made for a deeper character, perhaps the deepest sinceOn Her Majesty's Secret Servicewith George Lazenby as Bond.The tension between M and Bond is plainly palpable, continuing one aspect from the previous movies with Brosnan. Another aspect of Bond that continues to develop is his sensivity and vulnerability. It is not emphasised, but it does poke through on the odd occassion.Bond spent a lot of time playing poker in this movie, and that was a bit of a drawback. However, the tension was maintained and well done. For anyone not familiar with poker, some of the game play may be a bit of a mystery. This section of the movie was nicely broken up with an awesome fight scene and some other elements of tension.Of particular note was the chase on foot between Bond and a bomb-maker in Madagascar. The agility and speed of the actor playing the bomb-maker was stupendous. The man could move like nothing I have ever seen. It was scenes and chases like this that made the movie truly great.Daniel Craig could be set to become a Bond actor of the highest calibre.

1048569,A3CPX27XQ4BOKX,B000MNP2K8,moviemusicbuff,"[4, 7]","To tell you the truth, I was depressed when I first heard that Pierce Brosnan was replaced by Daniel Craig. But to my surprise, Daniel Craig is a really good James Bond who fits closely with the Ian Fleming description of Bond. Gone is the gentleman assassin associated with Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan's depiction; here we have the early Sean Connery Bond, the ruthless, detached assassin-spy. Daniel Craig brings back the danger in 007; you believe that Craig could at any moment strangle you to death, put a knife into your belly, or shoot you without blinking an eye. (Timothy Dalton captures the danger in Bond really well in his 2 films ""Living Daylights"" and ""Licence to Kill"") Craig reminds me a lot of Steve McQueen and his Bond is more like Jason Bourne -- the action is fast and furious.We also see Craig as a human Bond; he makes mistakes, he is driven by his male ego, he gets bruised, he bleeds, he gets tortured, and he gets heartbroken. All this was reflected in the Bond described in the novel Casino Royale. Craig is a really good actor who helps the viewer see inside the character of the man, just as George Lazenby did in ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"". It's nice to see Bond brought back down from being a comic book hero to being a real man with real emotions and issues. Great job, Daniel Craig!Eva Green does a commendable job as Vesper Lynd, Bond's love interest. Vesper is an intelligent and capable Treasury agent every bit as equal to Bond. It's always great to have a strong woman character in a Bond movie.There were some shortcomings in this movie: The chase sequence goes on too long where Bond chases the bombmaker. The title song and sequence weren't that great. The poker game drags on a bit too long, even though they put in bits of action in between. In fact, the whole movie could have been trimmed 25 minutes. Secondly, it is weird to hear M talk about 9-11 when this is the ""Bond Begins"" film; we have to forget 40 years of Bond films as though they didn't exist. Third, even though Judi Dench is a great actress, someone much younger should have been ""M"" for the chronology to make sense. Here Judi Dench looks older than ""Die Another Day"" when this is supposed to happen way before.Fourth, we know that Q doesn't show up until Dr. No, but it would have been great to have Bond have some gadgets either in his car or in his briefcase, not just the defibrillator. Also, it would have been great to have some good car chases, and have the Aston Martin do something.However, Martin Campbell does a great job of directing and introducing the 21st century Bond, just as he did in 1995 with Pierce Brosnan.I look forward to the next segment of Craig's Bond. I'm wondering if they could remake ""Man with the Golden Gun"", ""A View to a Kill,"" and ""Moonraker"", 3 of the most forgettable in the film series.The special features in the 2 disc version are great:  There are 3 featurettes:  one which features how Daniel Craig got the role, another which details the incredible stunts, and the third, an updated version of ""Bondgirls are Forever"" hosted by Maryam D' Abo, the bondwoman in ""The Living Daylights.""  I enjoyed the ""Bondgirls are Forever"" featurette the most -- it featured insightful interviews with all the famous bondwomen- Ursula Andress (Dr. No), Luciana Paluzzi (villainess in Thunderball), Honor Blackman (Goldfinger), Cary Lowell (License to Kill), Halle Berry (Die Another Day), Michelle Yeoh (Tomorrow Never Dies), Judi Dench and Samantha Bond (all the Pierce Brosnan films), Rosamund Pike (Die Another Day), Jill St. John (Diamonds are Forever), and Maud Adams (Man with the Golden Gun, Octopussy).

After a long, drawn out search with the names of some of Hollywood's elite being tossed around as possible contenders to step into the infamous 007 shoes (and tux), British actor Daniel Craig was chosen.""Casino Royale"" starts off with the super agent making his second kill, a requirement in order to achieve his ""double O"" status.  Bond's next order of business puts him on the trail of a bomb maker in Madagascar.  After being admonished by M (Judi Dench) for the way things unraveled (and for breaking into her home), Bond follows the trail to the Bahamas where he meets Alex Dimitrios (Simon Abkarian) and his wife Solange (Caterina Murino).  He soon learns the scheme that Dimitrios is involved in:  to blow up one of the world's premiere jetliners in Miami.  Bond, however, has other plans and foils the plot.From there M informs 007 of the deadly Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen), who lost a considerable amount of money when the jet's demise went awry.  Now desperate to get back the money, Le Chiffre plans an elaborate poker tournament.  With Bond as MI6""s best card player, they have no choice but to send him to Montenegro and back him in the tournament.  However, he doesn't go alone.  To make sure their initial investment of $10 million is secure, MI6 sends Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) to keep an eye on their assets.Once in Montenegro, the duo, who are supposed to pose as a couple madly in love, meet Mathis (Giancarlo Giannini), a field agent and later on, a CIA operative who is also in the poker tournament, Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright).  As the tournament intensifies, Bond and Vesper find themselves endangered when allies may not be who they appear to be.  Will Bond be able to stop Le Chiffre?  You'll have to watch ""Casino Royale"" to find out.With all of the press (some good and some bad) that's been surrounding not only the movie but also the announcement of a new Bond, this had to be one of the most anticipated movies of the year.  Film fans looking for an action packed 007 flick will not be disappointed.There were plenty of things that I liked about this one.  From the chase at the beginning of the movie to the scene where Le Chiffre is torturing Bond and even through the underwater sequences near the end, the movie is nothing short of intense.  But the film is not without its unique comedic timing particularly Bond's banter with M (when she threatens to have him killed if he reveals her true first name) and at other times with Vesper Lynd.  There are also a few funny moments with Mathis who seems to really enjoy his job!In ""Casino Royale"" we see a Bond that wasn't infallible.  Since Bond is new to the 007 gig, he does make mistakes and at times looses his cool.  We especially see this during the poker tournament when he, at one point, underestimates Le Chiffre.I also believe sometimes less is more.  The movie has almost no special effects and relies less on the gadgetry which were a bit detrimental to some of the previous Bond films.  This time around you're focused more on the story and what the people are up to on screen.The cast was also good and seemed to mesh well together.  Daniel Craig gives a good, solid performance as Bond as does Eva Green in the femme fatale role of Vesper Lynd.  It was also nice to see a little more screen time with Judi Dench as M.  A Bond film needs a truly memorable nemesis and Mads Mikkelsen as Le Chiffre delivers on this.There were a couple of things I would like to have seen in the movie.  There's only a brief introduction to Felix Leiter in the film so a little more screen time would have been nice, but probably not necessary in the scheme of things.  Also, at times, the poker tournament seemed to drag on a little.I questioned three other things about the movie.  Was Mathis really working for the enemy?  Where did Mr. White (Jesper Christensen) fit into all this?  ""Casino Royale"" never really answers this.  It could be assumed that these are cliffhangers that will be answered in the next Bond installment due out in 2008.My other question is (and this one is a major spoiler in case you want to stop reading here...), what were Vesper Lynd's true intentions/motivations?  One could argue that she really had feelings for James (who's about to leave MI6 for her) while another plausible view is that she schemed against him the entire time for the sake of her kidnapped boyfriend (who we're never told if he is released or murdered).  These are just minor things and do not detract from the overall movie.There's a lot to live up to with any 007 film.  ""Casino Royale"" delivers plenty of punch and helps to pave the way for the new direction that the Bond franchise is headed in with Daniel Craig.""Casino Royale"" runs 144 minutes and is rated PG-13 for intense sequences of violent action, scene of torture, sexual content and nudity.",4,"A New Bond, A New Direction",1165449600,"12 7, 2006",2006,5007,"['**Beware', 'May', 'Contain',

Spitzer ""mas017""","[6, 11]","The studio took a big risk with this film.They have basically abandoned the slap-stick comedy that has plagued Bond for 2 decades and created a very close and accurate portrayal of James Bond as written in the original novels from the 50s.These stories were dark, gritty and serious in tone.Of course it is safe to say that probably 95%+ of Bond fans only know James Bond from the movies, thus THEY may think this movie is off base for the character when it is actually the closest we have seen since 1962's ""DR NO"" when Sean Connery played a more serious Bond in the firt film.I know this is true because many critics of the film have attacked it for being very ""un-Bond-like"" when in fact it is almost dead on.Okay... the criticisms...1)Since this film is intended to explain how Bond earned his Double-0 license to kill, it theoretically of course pre-dates DR NO.This presents a problem for the nit-picky ""Bond World Historians"" since Bond's first boss ""M"" was a man.Also Daniel Craig appears a bit older than Sean Connery was in the first film.2) About Daniel Craig... His acting and dedication to playing this part wins you over out of respect.... BUT............. James Bond is supposed to have a ""dark and cruel look"".Okay.... with that stare, Craig has the cruel part down, but why couldn't they have darkened his hair a bit to at least visually match the Fleming description of Bond since they did everything else so accurately ?In the end, as I said above Daniel Craig earns your respect with his acting ability (I was NOT originally happy to hear he won the role.... I was hoping for somebody like the dark haired actor from SIN CITY---forgot his name right now).But Craig does capture the personality of the ""Fleming Novel Version of Bond"", even if the physical appearance is slightly off.Sidenote: I have always seen Craig as a villian for some reason, not a good guy..... but again I repeat..... he earned my respect to the point I accept him in the role.I hope they keep him on a serious side though, I don't want him to start throwing out one-liner comedy in the future.Since I am a Bond fan for over 30+ years, I for one was happy to see the studio scrap the silly humor, the ""Bond Formula"" that was being used in almost everyone of the last 10+ films, and the overemphasis on special effects and stunts simply for the sale of ""eye candy"".Finally we have a more gritty, dark and dangerous spy-vs-spy world with a tough Bond and not pretty boys grinning and smiling as they toss out one-liners like they know their lives are never in any real danger.I think the success of ""24"" on Fox and The Bourne Identity taught the studios a lesson..... people want the serious spy stories again and NOT the comical romps and frolics thru over-the-top CGI-land with bad guys that look like they came out of a Marvel Comic Book.Bond is Back !I hope the general viewing public is sharp enough to know or educate themselves on some Bond/Fleming history to appeciate this film for what it is.",4,How many Bond fans have actually read Flemings' novels?,1163721600,"11 17, 2006",2006,2993,"['studio', 'took', 'big', 'risk', 'film.They', 'have', 'basically', 'abandoned', 'slap-stick', 'comedy', 'plagued', 'Bond', '2', 'decades', 'created', 'very', 'close', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'James', 'Bond', 'written', 'original', 'novels', '50s.These', 'stories', 'were', 'dark', 'gritty', 'serious', 'tone.Of', 'course', 'safe', 'say', 'probably', '95', '%', '+', 'Bond', 'fans', 'only', 'know', 'James', 'Bond', 'movies', 'thus', 'THEY', 'may', 'think', 'movie', 'base', 'character', 'when', 'actually', 'closest', 'have', 'seen', '1962', 'DR', 'NO', 'when', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'played', 'more', 'serious', 'Bond', 'firt', 'film.I', 'know', 'true', 'because', 'many', 'critics', 'film', 'have', 'attacked', 'being', 'very', 'un-Bond-like', 'when', 'fact', 'almost', 'dead', 'on.Okay', 'criticisms', '1', 'film', 'intended', 'explain', 'how', 'Bond', 'earned', 'Double-0', 'license', 'kill', 'theoretically', 'course', 'pre-dates', 'DR', 'NO.This', 'problem', 'nit-picky', 'Bond', 'World', 'Historians', 'Bond', 'first', 'boss', 'M', 'was', 'man.Also', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'bit', 'older', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'was', 'first', 'film.2', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'acting', 'dedication', 'playing', 'part', 'respect', 'BUT', 'James', 'Bond', 'supposed', 'have', 'dark', 'cruel', 'look', '.Okay', 'stare', 'Craig', 'cruel', 'part', 'down', 'why', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'darkened', 'hair', 'bit', 'least', 'visually', 'match', 'Fleming', 'description', 'Bond', 'did', 'everything', 'else', 'so', 'accurately', 'end', 'said', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'respect', 'acting', 'ability', 'was', 'NOT', 'originally', 'happy', 'hear', 'won', 'role', 'was', 'hoping', 'somebody', 'dark', 'haired', 'actor', 'SIN', 'CITY', '-forgot', 'name', 'right', 'now', '.But', 'Craig', 'capture', 'personality', 'Fleming', 'Novel', 'Version', 'Bond', 'even', 'physical', 'appearance', 'slightly', 'off.Sidenote', 'have', 'always', 'seen', 'Craig', 'villian', 'reason', 'not', 'good', 'guy', '..', 'again', 'repeat', '..', 'earned', 'respect', 'point', 'accept', 'role.I', 'hope', 'keep', 'serious', 'side', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'start', 'throwing', 'one-liner', 'comedy', 'future.Since', 'am', 'Bond', 'fan', '30+', 'years', 'one', 'was', 'happy', 'see', 'studio', 'scrap', 'silly', 'humor', 'Bond', 'Formula', 'was', 'being', 'used', 'almost', 'everyone', 'last', '10+', 'films', 'overemphasis', 'special', 'effects', 'stunts', 'simply', 'sale', 'eye', 'candy', '.Finally', 'have', 'more', 'gritty', 'dark', 'dangerous', 'spy-vs-spy', 'world', 'tough', 'Bond', 'not', 'pretty', 'grinning', 'smiling', 'toss', 'out', 'one-liners', 'know', 'lives', 'are', 'never', 'real', 'danger.I', 'think', 'success', '24', 'Fox', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'taught', 'studios', 'lesson', '..', 'people', 'want', 'serious', 'spy', 'stories', 'again', 'NOT', 'comical', 'romps', 'frolics', 'thru', 'over-the-top', 'CGI-land', 'bad', 'guys', 'look', 'came', 'Marvel', 'Comic', 'Book.Bond', 'Back', 'hope', 'general', 'viewing', 'public', 'sharp', 'enough', 'know', 'educate', 'Bond/Fleming', 'history', 'appeciate', 'film', 'what']",N/A
1048573,A32JN2H1NIVILH,B000MNP2K8,Mumbabeal93,"[0, 0]","Casino Royale is arguably one of the greatest 007 films of all time. Often placed #1 on lists and it's up there as well. Goldeneye was the last highly received film in the series and often regarded as Pierce Brosnan's only good movie (i personally enjoyed the next 2). Die Another Day was his last and was successful but bordering on sci-fi and fantasy at times, a lot of fans were disappointed. It was too much to take and didn't feel like a Bond film. Moonraker had a similar atmosphere which tend to go to far, after that they brought the series back to it's roots with For Your Eyes Only. Casino Royale brings the series back to it's roots and it was actually a remake of a '50s, made-for-TV movie staring Peter Lorre as Le Chiffre. The '50s movie is good and worth having in your collection but the 2006 version blows the original out of the water. Much closer to Ian Fleming's novel. Daniel Craig makes his debut as Bond here and he's easily the best Bond since Sean Connery. Vesper Lynd (played by Eva Green) is one of the better Bond girls and plays a strong lead character; Jeffrey Wright plays a good, believable role as Felix; Judi Dench continues as &#34;M&#34; (also in the Pierce Brosnan movies) in Casino Royale and plays a believable role as well.Casino Royale has a lot plot, action, emotion and character development which many Bonds lack. Opening scene is excellent as well, starting off in B&W; and changing to color during the theme with &#34;You Know My Name&#34; by Chris Cornell.

Die Another Day was pretty bad, but this...  Okay, I could accept Daniel Craig as James Bond.  He was not the problem here.  The problem was that this looked more like a 1970's Chuck Norris movie than a James Bond movie. (I loved Chuck Norris and his movies by the way).  This movie was about money.  No supervillains...Just money.  And can anyone really believe that the British government in a effort to thwart the bad guys would come up with a plan like this one?  Lets stake our best poker player to a few million and hope he wins.  No. Also, as I recall in earlier Bond films, (Goldfinger, I think) 007 was given him his Aston-Martin by Q.  He hadn't won it in a poker game.  Bond and action go together, but the climbing up the cranes and the jumping from crane to crane was way over the top.  Also, when Bond swerves his car to avoid hitting the girl in the road...Maybe the most ridiculous looking bit of fakery in recent big budget movie history. I did kind of like the collapsing building in Venice though I must admit. I gave this 2 stars only because it was James Bond and the closing theme was worth replaying.  James Bond needs to be more sauve...That's the appeal of the franchise.  Where was the wit?  Oh, I'm sorry, the line about that last hand almost killing me was it.

If you like that Bond, and are hoping to see him again in Casino Royale, then you'll probably be surprised and possibly disappointed with this newest film in the franchise. But, if you have enjoyed the Mission Impossible and Bourne Identity movies, you'll love Daniel Craig as the new James Bond.This newest (oldest?) adventure of Bond is actually the first story in the series, explaining how he came to earn his 007 status, as well as some of the experiences that led to the smooth operator we've seen in previous movies. This Bond (Daniel Craig) is hard, arrogant, and brutal. He has no soul and has shut off all emotion, as he must do to be an effective killer - and this is at least one reason which explains his many sexual exploits without connection or personal meaning to the many ""Bond girls"" we've come to know through the past 20 movies.The plot of Casino Royale is a bit difficult to follow, as it jumps from bad guy to bad guy, until settling upon Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkleson), a banker who uses terrorist money to play the stock market. While Le Chiffre is creepy with a cloudy eye that weeps blood, he's not the evil villain we've seen in previous Bond movies. When James foils his plot to blow up an airplane, Le Chiffre loses $100 million and therefore, sets up a high stakes poker game to win back his losses and pay back his clients. Of course, Mr. Bond gets in on the action.This is one of the slowest parts of the movie, as it's hard to make a 2-day poker game exciting. Typically, we see this type of scene placed at the end of a movie, as the climax to the plot. In Casino Royale, the card game is in the middle of this 2 hour LONG movie. The story then moves on to Bond falling in love with the MI6 accountant, Vesper Lynd (Eva Green), only to jump back into the previous storyline (just when you think it's over, it starts all over again). While the love story is nice, it is really unnecessary and out of place. We are supposed to be convinced that this hard, cold killer is softened by this vulnerable woman and willing to quit the spy business altogether, all in the matter of two days. Unlikely.While Bond movies aren't supposed to be taken too seriously, the plot just doesn't hold up to scrutiny. Once Le Chiffre is found, why isn't he taken into custody? What was the purpose of playing the card game, just to arrest him at the end? Much of what Bond does, especially at the beginning, is unexplained, and his abilities are unbelievable. The characters lack depth, are predictable, and really aren't that likeable. Except, I must say, Daniel Craig does an excellent job of being a hard, mean, brutal killer. Most of the movie he sports numerous cuts on his hands and face, and many of the fight scenes and murders are ugly and graphic. He is focused and determined.Unlike previous Bond movies, Casino Royale does not employ the use of interesting gadgets. Q and Moneypenny are missing from the story as well, with the only other familiar character being M (Judi Dench). M isn't so impressed with Bond, calling him a ""blunt instrument"" at one point, as he lacks refinement and discretion. He's such a loose cannon, she has a tracking device inserted into the inside of his wrist and has someone watching over him the rest of his assignment. Not quite the James Bond you expect to see, but by the end of the movie he has begun to show some of the qualities we have come to know in James Bond.MOVIEBLOG RECOMMENDS:If you like action movies, you will undoubtedly enjoy this one, but don't go expecting to see what we've seen in Sean Connery, Roger Moore or Pierce Brosnan. This is a new James Bond, re-invented for a new, harder-edged audience.Additionally, it is unbelievable that the movie is rated PG-13, as it really should be R for the torture scene specifically. This movie is for adults and older teens.AFTER THE SHOW:* What did you like or dislike about the new James Bond? Is there anything from previous Bond movies you would like to have seen?* Bond is described as having no soul, meaning his lack of conscience and emotion. Do you think someone like this could be changed so dramatically, as portrayed in the movie?

Davies ""Scalpel Reviews""","[0, 0]","PLOTIn this prequel-style instalment, a young James Bond is promoted to ""00"" status and deployed on various missions; some physical, some cerebral, some emotional.REVIEWTo me, there's the first three Connery films - more thrillers than action films - all of them deserving credit. Then there's all the dated and boring entries spanning the ensuing 30 years, with only the very occasional exception. And then there's Daniel Craig and his Casino Royale. The real James Bond has kindly stood up.There are at least two sequences that I will always remember from this film. The first precedes the opening credits, where Bond ""earns his stripes""; the second is where he overcomes an attempt on his life whilst playing poker. I cannot go into these exquisite moments in any more detail because I'll ruin the film for those who haven't seen it.Of course, for the explosion fanatics, there are plenty of heavy-duty action scenes worthy of note, especially one taking place at Miami airport.

I was especially unhappy upon hearing of a re-booting for James Bond as well, having grown somewhat fond of Pierce Brosnan in the role of agent 007, even though his films had grown stale over time, but little did I know just how good things would get.  Casino Royale is just the kick in the pants that the long running franchise has needed; inserting Daniel Craig (Layer Cake, Road to Perdition, Munich) as James Bond, as well as overhauling everything else.  This time around deals with Bond's origin as he sets off on his first mission as a double-O; getting involved in an ultra-high stakes poker game to nail a scarred, inhaler puffing terrorist financier (Mads Mikkelsen) who weeps blood.  Things get a little more complicated when Bond falls head over heals for treasury agent Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) as the twisty plot unfolds over the course of the film's running time; which also includes some spectacular action sequences, stunt work, violence which pushes the limits of the film's PG-13 rating, and a torture scene that really will make you wince.  Martin Campbell, who directed Brosnan's debut as Bond with Goldeneye, leaves a considerable mark with Casino Royale, providing nearly everything he did that made Goldeneye a memorable Bond film.  And as far as Craig goes as the new 007, well, he's great.  He has the right mix of charisma, style, and dark demeanor that it takes to be a great Bond, and he fits the mold like a well tailored suit.  Judi Dench returns as M, but don't expect any Q, John Cleese, or Moneypenny here.  Indeed, as said before, Casino Royale is the kick in the teeth that the James Bond franchise needed, and fresh air is breathed into the franchise from Craig, Campbell, and everyone else involved.

I have always liked Pierce Brosnan (for some reason, other people didn't) in this prestigious role, and now that he has retired as a 00 agent, it is great to see someone even better replace him.""Casino Royale"" revisits the beginnings of the well-known British secret agent, and it does so in a very stylish manner. Every second of the movie is carefully thought out, and it really is perfect. James Bond is now played by Daniel Craig (""Elizabeth"", ""Sylvia"", ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider""), who adds an interesting twist to this well-known character. Apparently, in the beginning, Bond couldn't care less if his martini was shaken or stirred, his first kill was pretty rough and not at all elegant, and he was also a little kinky. Of course, he has always been very cool, with the latest gadgets, fast cars and beautiful women.Speaking of women, ""Casino Royale"" doesn't disappoint. The latest Bond girl is Eva Green. As every good Bond girl should be, she is not both beautiful AND brainy, and is very believable in her role. Also, she is one of few 007 love interests to not be interested in Mr. Bond... until she is, of course.And of course, there is action involved, and lots of it. However, the movie is very smart - not all action consists of explosions, guns and foreign assassins (although, it's not like these elements aren't there!). In order for Bond to successfully accomplish his mission, this time he doesn't need to kill anybody... he needs to win a game of poker. Although this may sound like a major turn-off, it is magnificently executed - the scenes around the table are awesome, exciting and full of drama. Also, there is a sub-plot involved, because you don't just become 007: there is something for Bond, James Bond to do before he gains his title.""Casino Royale"" is one of the most satisfying movies to come out in 2006. It is everything a James Bond movie should be, and then some.

1048591,A1BXRM9U3XTLCJ,B000MNP2K8,"Nina Munteanu ""SF Girl""","[1, 2]","This motion picture, directed by Martin Campbell (Goldeneye) created a dichotomy in my family and in my movie-going community: one side was utterly disappointed, even disgusted, and the other side surprisingly impressed. For once, I sided with the critics--many who extoled this latest of Bond films for its refreshing candor, dark edge and gritty realism. I say, for once, because, more often than not, I have taken the opposite side of the majority of critics (see my other reviews here and elsewhere), finding gems where others have found only rock. This time I have good company; except for my own family and friends, that is. It would seem that, although Casino Royale was highly regarded by the critics of the franchise, its long-standing viewing public was not equally impressed. Yes, this was a different Bond movie, which the Mandelbrot fractal designed title opening and title song hinted at: did you listen to the words of the title song?Of those in the negative camp there appear to be two major reasons for rejecting this lastest version of Bond. One is the Bond character himself (played with edgy grit by tautly coiled Daniel Craig) and how the other characters were portrayed (especially Bond Girl,Vesper Lynd, superbly played by Eva Green but with no revealing cleavage); the second is the lack of Bond clich&eacute;s, such as the techno-gadgetry, non-stop action, womanizing and comic-book humour. Despite showcasing some of the most mouth-watering chase scenes (particularly the opening chase with parkour [free running] originator, Sebasti&eacute;n Foucan, and Craig doing most of the stunts himself), this Bond film was a more thoughtful one. It was also probably one of the most physically demanding Bond films to play by its lead character. David Edelstein of New York Magazine, describes the director's ""awe for the poetry of human bodies doing things that, evolutionarily speaking, they haven't needed to do since the saber-toothed tiger died off.""There are, I think, several reasons for this dichotomy between those of us who loved Casino Royale and those who remained diffident, disappointed or outright disliked it. One of which--and it is I think an important one--is that I have read the entire series, and long before a flashy movie was made using the title (often only using the title!). I grew up with Sean Connery as the quintessential Bond, a roughly handsome man with striking eyes and a cruel mouth.In the book version of Casino Royale, Vesper Lynd, after just meeting Bond, admits to Mathis: ""He is very good looking...but there is something cold and ruthless in his [mouth]..."" Ian Fleming's Bond is a somber misogynist who initially wants to bed Vesper as if to punish her for not falling for his charm:Her eyes were wide apart and deep blue and they gazed candidly back at Bond with a touch of ironical disinterest which, to his annoyance, he found he would like to shatter, roughly.I would not describe Campbell's Bond as a misogynist, despite tendencies for being a ruthless sociopath with a slightly sadistic sense of humour. After Casino Royale and his experience with one particular woman, he might have turned into one, though...Daniel Craig and those scintillating radioactive blue eyes brings us back to why we are ultimately fascinated with the character of James Bond. Think for a moment: this man is basically a sociopath, an assassin with a license to kill, dispense violence and torture to protect queen and country--a concept. Well, perhaps not quite a concept. Which brings us to M, Bond's pithy superior in MI-6 in the British Secret Service. Bond is like a child in many ways, emotionally certainly. David Edelstein of New York Magazine describes Craig's Bond as: ""haunted, not yet housebroken, still figuring out his persona.""The movie series--and this film in particular--explores this aspect of Bond through his complex relationship with M (played superbly by Dame Judi Dench). M is like a mother to him. His allegiance to queen and country, so prevalent in many of the Bond movies, appears a natural progression of this intuitive search to belong and connect, particularly in his reltionship with M. He breaks into her private house, not for a moment realizing--or capable of caring-- what this invasion of privacy means to her. M scolds Bond like he is a child and calls him a ""blunt instrument"". Says M: ""Any thug can kill. I want you to take your ego out of the equation."" Craig's Bond is the closest to the original character envisaged by Fleming, who describes Bond's features as ""a taciturn mask, ironical, brutal, and cold."" Carrie Rickey of the Philadelphia Inquirer describes Craig as ""earthy and exotic, holding himself like a smoking gun.""Thanks to excellent script writing by Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and Paul Haggis, it is Vesper Lynd in the movie who recognizes that Bond is an orphan, looking for home--though she doesn't call him on the latter. Bond is a man who doesn't recognize boundaries, who's closed off his emotions from the rest of him.The length to which he protects that inner vulnerable self is evident in his rakish and shallow relationships with women. After Vesper insists on separate rooms at the hotel, Bond says, ""Don't worry. You're not my type."" To which she tartly quips, ""Smart?"" And he responds, ""Single."" This is more elaborately described in the book:Bond saw luck as a woman, to be softly wooed or brutally ravaged, never pandered to or pursued...One day, and he accepted the fact, he would be brought to his knees by love or by luck. When that happened he knew that he too would be branded with the deadly question-mark he recognized so often in others, the promise to pay before you have lost; the acceptance of fallibility.It is so apt that Vesper Lynd is the one to shatter his cool and it is she (in the form of luck and love) who literally brings him to his knees by the last pages of the book with her tragic act of suicide.Despite a truly chilling villain in Le Chiffre (played by Mads Mikkelsen) and that frightening souless Mister White (keep an eye on him from the first scene; I think he will resurface in Bond 22), it is not the villains in Casino Royale who place equal footing with Bond; it is the two women in his life. I found atypical ""Bond Girl"" Vesper Lynd (his alluring and mysterious foil with dark depth) and M, his forthright boss, equally compelling and complex as Bond. They, better than the villains, help to define Bond and permit the film to rise from the shallows of its predecesors into the interesting arena of real art.This definitive Bond film, begins appropriately wtih a slick black and white prologue of Bond's pre `00' status (prior to achieving two kills). The heady and violent chiaroscuro creates a mood in keeping with the edgy grit of Craig's Bond, ""whose cruel charisma rivals that of Sean Connery"" (Ty Burr, Boston Globe). Every scene that follows defines Bond: his ruthless drive in the footchase; his sardonic humor when he's mistaken for a valet and ""punishes"" the customer by crashing his expensive car, marking Bond's disdain for the declass&eacute; rich (a trait that is further made apparent during Vesper's penetrating analysis of him in the train).Producer, Barbara Broccoli, successfully subverted the Bond trope to finally portray a ""Bond Girl"" as equal to Bond; someone equally complex, mysterious and interesting with her own compelling story, so much so that she draws the insular Bond into it. ""The idea of a woman who is Bond's equal is unusual in the 007 series,"" says Jay Stone of the Times Colonist in his article entitled, ""Bond Girl with Brains"". Vesper is a compelling character, a real person; not just a mannequin for men to fantacize over. There have been other intelligent and strong-willed Bond Girls (e.g., Jinx in Die Another Day; Polly Goodhead in Moonraker; Natalya Simonova in Goldeneye), but none as engaging, none as vulnerable, contradictory and multi-layered as Vesper, who harbors a dark secret. It is partly Vesper's dark secret that unknowingly clinches Bond's interest. Vesper demonstrates right from her opening scene where she first meets Bond onboard a Euro fast train that she is not a typical Bond girl. First there is no gushy ""Oh, she's gaspingly beautiful!"" music to accompany her on-screen entrance; no highlighting of her physical attributes; no bikini to cue us in that she is the ""Bond Girl"".Instead, Vesper sweeps in like a summer storm and sits across from Bond, dressed in what he describes as ""slightly masculine cut clothing"" and flashes him with eyes that sparkle of taunting girlish impudence. As she takes her seat, she summarily announces ""I'm the money,"" succinctly letting him know that she is in charge and what she thinks of him. Even his attempt at a rakish response, ""Every penny of it,"" doesn't phase her and she launches into a sarcastic examination of the plan, further letting him know what she thinks of the whole plan of poker: ""I suppose you've given some thought to the notion that if you lose, our government will have directly financed terrorism"". So she'll be keeping her eye on their government's money and not on Bond's ""perfectly formed"" backside. To this Bond quips, ""You noticed."" Vesper has a quick come back: ""Even accountants have imagination."" To his suggestion of a plan, ""Oh, there's a plan,"" she responds in a mocking tone. ""I got the impression we were risking millions of dollars and hundreds of lives on a game of chance."" Then she challenges him on his ability to bluff and read people (which provides the first in several installments of a subplot involving bluffing and ""tells"").Their verbal joust, which sizzles with sexual tension, escalates when Bond, priding himself in his ability to read people, demonstrates his skill as a poker player by arrogantly analyzing Vesper's personality and life from cues in their conversation. She turns the tables by doing an even more penetrating character sketch of him, calling him on his hubris and ego, and essentially outbluffing him:""By the cut of your suit you went to Oxford or wherever and actually think human beings dress like that. But you wear it with such disdain. My guess is you didn't come from money and your school friends never let you forget it, which means you were at that school by the grace of someone else's charity, hence the chip on your shoulder...and since your first thought about me ran to orphan, that's what I'd say you are..."" Seeing his expression, she gloats, ""Oh, you are! I like this poker thing. And it makes perfect sense. Since MI6 looks for maladjusted young men who give little thought to sacrificing others in order to protect queen and country. You know, former SAS types, with easy smiles and expensive watches..."" She glances down at his. ""Rolex?"" Then dives in for the killing blow: ""Now, having just met you, I wouldn't go as far as calling you a cold-hearted bastard...but it wouldn't be a stretch to imagine you think of women as disposable pleasures rather than meaningful pursuits.""But more than outbluffing him, Vesper also proves herself to be a complex person on her own ""hero's journey"", a tortured character (we find out only later) with heavy matters to consider that involve more than the Bond girl's typical single question: ""should I sleep with this guy or not?"" The fullness and depth of her character as a ""real"" person is no better found than in the tender shower scene midway, where we are reminded that Vesper is a real person, an accountant unused to violence. Again, we find Bond about to enter their common bathroom to the sounds of a shower; I fully expected to see the typical playful scene between the Bond girl, nude in the shower, and Bond. But when he opens the door, she is revealed sitting under the shower, still fully clothed in her evening gown, shivering in shock. She'd just witnessed (and had even helped) a violent altercation in which Bond had to beat a man to death. For the first time in this series, we have a perfectly plausible reaction. Vesper is strong at first and assists Bond by helping to force the gun out of the assailant's hand, then breaks down after she's done what needs to be done and is alone. Bond surprises us by melting into a caring human being as he quietly and patiently comforts Vesper. And Broccoli tastefully does not let it dissolve into a sexual love scene. This scene is just one of several where the film takes a typical Bond clich&eacute; and brazenly turns it on its side--where we expect one thing and get quite another. An amusing example of this is when Bond playfully informs Vesper, as they are driving to their hotel, of her cover name (""Miss Stephanie Broadchest"") to which she takes great exception.Vesper certainly has Bond sized up. ""There are dinner jackets and there are dinner jackets,"" Vesper informs the bemused Bond in an earlier scene. She introduces him to the tailored tuxedo, in which he looks utterly splendid, by the way. The scene where he critically eyes himself in the mirror in his new tux provides us with a snapshot that is all Bond (and all Craig, I should add!): suave, sophisticated and mercurial, yet boyishly inviting, even awkward. Eva Green's ""Vesper is teasing, angry, and vulnerable in madly unpredictable proportions"" David Edelstein (New York Magazine) adds. A smart, self-possessed government accountant, Vesper ""has the sensuality and extraordinary empathy to tenderize [Bond's] presence,"" said Scragow of the Baltimore Sun. Broccoli improved on Fleming's Vesper by making her a treasury accountant in charge of the money, and therefore of Bond.Keeping true to Fleming's first James Bond book, the film version of Casino Royale is, at its heart, a tragic love story. As Stax (IGN) says: ""Bond falls in love, he changes; he cares for a woman rather than just lusts after her. They make love, laugh, quarrel but there is a friendship and tenderness between them. That makes the outcome of the story and Bond's infamous last line--`the bitch is dead'--all the more heartbreaking"". Casino Royale is a story of how a scarred man found his humanity through love, only to loose both to the `game'. The irony of what Bond became, following Vesper's death, lies in her absolute mastery of him. Her power over his heart was elegantly shown as she both physically and metaphorically jumpstarted it. In fact, she saves his life twice. In the end she beats him with the ultimate bluff, beating him squarely at his own game. When she realizes that she will never escape SPECTRE, Vesper successfully hides her tortured decision to save Bond by ironically betraying him. In keeping with the book, Vesper's character is tormented by her genuine love for Bond and her conviction that he would hate her once he learned the truth about her--compelling her to end her life. The reason she succeeds so well in outbluffing him (and the audience) is because in matters of the heart she is tenderly sincere. As Bond himself declared to her, ""Everyone has a `tell'...except you...that's why I love you."" Blinded by their mutual love, he is totally sidewinded by her underhandedness. This explains why Bond later refuses to lower his armor and become vulnerable with any other woman; how can he trust his spy-sense when matters of the heart intersect and blur his cold judgement? He must, Bond concludes, keep them apart, tuck that humanity way inside, never let it get out again.While some of the movie-Bond tropes are there...they are few and well placed and just enough to remind us of how Bond uses off-colour humor to disarm or even to disturb. After a near-fatal interlude during the film's card game, he quips, ""I'm sorry, that last hand nearly killed me.""Another clich&eacute; which this film turned on its side is the classic figure emerging out of the sea--this time not the Bond Girl, but Bond himself. To those who lament the old clich&eacute;s, Ty Burr of the Boston Globe offers this: ""consider whether, after twenty-one Bond films and countless parodies, your response is simply Pavlovian.""

I'm not sure that this one will be all that memorable either-but I like the new complexties of this Bond.  There's a sense of a wounded soul and I find that appealing instead of the easy flirtatious playboy. The only thing is despite the terrific body Craig looks too stiff and unbelivable in the love scenes.  I didn't believe for a moment the sudden love story.  In fact when he started talking about being in love, I started frowning at the screen and wondering if I missed something.  The final scene was also anti-climatic.

1048593,AYU9LBROYQBG6,B000MNP2K8,"Noel Serrano ""Gala Foundation http://gfoundat...","[0, 0]","Critics gave the film a positive response, in particular Craig's performance and credibility. During production this had been subject to debate by the media and the public, as Craig did not appear to fit Ian Fleming's original portrait of the character as tall, dark, and suave. The Daily Telegraph compared the quality of Craig's characterization of Bond to Sean Connery's and praised the script as smartly written, noting how the film departed from the series' conventions. The Times compared the more assertive portrayal by Craig to Timothy Dalton, and praised the action as edgy,[64] with another reviewer citing in particular the action sequence involving the cranes in Madagascar.[65] Critics Paul Arendt of BBC Films,[66] Kim Newman of Empire[67] and Todd McCarthy of Variety[68] all described Craig as the first actor to truly embody Ian Fleming's James Bond from the original novel: ironic, brutal, and cold.The film was similarly well received in North America. MSNBC gave the movie a perfect 5 star rating.[69] The film was described as taking James Bond ""back to his roots"", similar to From Russia with Love,[70] where the focus was on character and plot rather than the high-tech gadgets and visual effects that were strongly criticised in Die Another Day.[68] Rotten Tomatoes gave the movie an aggregate rating of 94%, the highest rating for a wide-release of the year. It is the fifth-highest rating for a Bond film on the site behind Goldfinger which received a 95%, The Spy Who Loved Me and From Russia with Love which both received a 96%,[71][72] and Dr. No, with a 97% score.[73] Metacritic gave the movie a Metascore of 81, signifying ""Universal Acclaim.""[74] Entertainment Weekly named the film as the fifth best of the series,[75] and chose Vesper Lynd as the fourth best Bond girl in the series.[76] Some newspaper columnists and critics were impressed enough by Craig's performance to consider him a viable candidate for an Academy Award nomination.[77][78][79] Roger Ebert gave the film a four out of four star rating, the first for any of the James Bond films he reviewed. Ebert stated that Casino Royale answered many of the questions he had begun to ask himself about the 45-year-old series, like why no character seems to have any real emotions. Ebert also felt that this was the first Bond film that got him to care about Bond, and the rest of the characters.[80]However, the film met several mixed reactions. Though American radio personality Michael Medved gave the film three stars out of four, describing it as ""intriguing, audacious and very original... more believable and less cartoonish, than previous 007 extravaganzas"", he commented that the ""sometimes sluggish pacing will frustrate some Bond fanatics.""[81] Similarly, a reviewer for The Sun praised the film for its darkness and Craig's performance, but felt that ""like the novel, it suffers from a lack of sharpness in the plot"" and believed that it required additional editing, particularly the finale.[82] Commentators such as Emanuel Levy concurred, feeling the ending was too long, and that the film's terrorist villains lacked depth, although he praised Craig and gave the film a B+ overall.[83] Other reviewers responded negatively, including Tim Adams of The Observer who felt the film came off uncomfortably in an attempt to make the series grittier.[84]",5,A NEW JAMES BOND WITH STEROIDS!,1231372800,"01 8, 2009",2009,3355,"['Critics', 'gave', 'film', 'positive', 'response', 'particular', 'Craig', 'performance', 'credibility', 'production', 'had', 'been', 'subject', 'debate', 'media', 'public', 'Craig', 'did', 'not', 'appear', 'fit', 'Ian', 'Fleming', 'original', 'portrait', 'character', 'tall', 'dark', 'suave', 'Daily', 'Telegraph', 'compared', 'quality', 'Craig', 'characterization', 'Bond', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'praised', 'script', 'smartly', 'written', 'noting', 'how', 'film', 'departed', 'series', 'conventions', 'Times', 'compared', 'more', 'assertive', 'portrayal', 'Craig', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'praised', 'action', 'edgy', '64', ']', 'reviewer', 'citing', 'particular', 'action', 'sequence', 'involving', 'cranes', 'Madagascar', '65', ']', 'Critics', 'Paul', 'Arendt', 'BBC', 'Films', '[', '66', ']', 'Kim', 'Newman', 'Empire', '[', '67', ']', 'Todd', 'McCarthy', 'Variety', '[', '68', ']', 'described', 'Craig', 'first', 'actor', 'truly', 'embody', 'Ian', 'Fleming', 'James', 'Bond', 'original', 'novel', 'ironic', 'brutal', 'cold.The', 'film', 'was', 'similarly', 'well', 'received', 'North', 'America', 'MSNBC', 'gave', 'movie', 'perfect', '5', 'star', 'rating', '[', '69', 'film', 'was', 'described', 'taking', 'James', 'Bond', 'back', 'roots', 'similar', 'From', 'Russia', 'Love', '[', '70', ']', 'where', 'focus', 'was', 'character', 'plot', 'rather', 'high-tech', 'gadgets', 'visual', 'effects', 'were', 'strongly', 'criticised', 'Die', 'Day', '[', '68', ']', 'Rotten', 'Tomatoes', 'gave', 'movie', 'aggregate', 'rating', '94', '%', 'highest', 'rating', 'wide-release', 'year', 'fifth-highest', 'rating', 'Bond', 'film', 'site', 'Goldfinger', 'received', '95', '%', 'Spy', 'Who', 'Loved', 'Me', 'From', 'Russia', 'Love', 'received', '96', '%', '[', '71', ']', '72', ']', 'Dr.', 'No', '97', '%', 'score', '73', ']', 'Metacritic', 'gave', 'movie', 'Metascore', '81', 'signifying', 'Universal', 'Acclaim', '[', '74', ']', 'Entertainment', 'Weekly', 'named', 'film', 'fifth', 'best', 'series', '[', '75', ']', 'chose', 'Vesper', 'Lynd', 'fourth', 'best', 'Bond', 'girl', 'series', '76', 'newspaper', 'columnists', 'critics', 'were', 'impressed', 'enough', 'Craig', 'performance', 'consider', 'viable', 'candidate', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nomination', '77', ']', '78', ']', '[', '79', ']', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'gave', 'film', 'four', 'four', 'star', 'rating', 'first', 'James', 'Bond', 'films', 'reviewed', 'Ebert', 'stated', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'answered', 'many', 'questions', 'had', 'begun', 'ask', '45-year-old', 'series', 'why', 'character', 'have', 'real', 'emotions', 'Ebert', 'also', 'felt', 'was', 'first', 'Bond', 'film', 'got', 'care', 'Bond', 'rest', 'characters', '80', ']', 'However', 'film', 'met', 'several', 'mixed', 'reactions', 'American', 'radio', 'personality', 'Michael', 'Medved', 'gave', 'film', 'three', 'four', 'describing', 'intriguing', 'audacious', 'very', 'original', 'more', 'believable', 'less', 'cartoonish', 'previous', '007', 'extravaganzas', 'commented', 'sometimes', 'sluggish', 'pacing', 'will', 'frustrate', 'Bond', 'fanatics', '[', '81', ']', 'Similarly', 'reviewer', 'Sun', 'praised', 'film', 'darkness', 'Craig', 'performance', 'felt', 'novel', 'lack', 'sharpness', 'plot', 'believed', 'required', 'additional', 'editing', 'particularly', 'finale', '82', ']', 'Commentators', 'such', 'Emanuel', 'Levy', 'concurred', 'feeling', 'ending', 'was', 'too', 'long', 'film', 'terrorist', 'villains', 'lacked', 'depth', 'praised', 'Craig', 'gave', 'film', 'B+', 'overall', '83', ']', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'responded', 'negatively', 'including', 'Tim', 'Adams', 'Observer', 'who', 'felt', 'film', 'came', 'off', 'uncomfortably', 'attempt', 'make', 'series', 'grittier', '84', ']']",N/A

Many Bond fans will hail Craig as the new and best bond, but thats just because hes new.  Everyone said that about Brosnan after Goldeneye, and I bet they said it almost every time a new Bond opened with a good first movie.So, let me start by saying, however, the film rocked. Really, I loved it. So why the three stars instead of 4 or 5?  Because it didn't feel like Bond to me.  It had some of the musical feel (not enough use of the original theme though), the same characters, but so many things were missing.  Q, Moneypenny, and an appropriate intro.  Yes, I hated the intro. Why? No girls. I'm not a pervert, but virtually every other Bond intro had girls dancing to the movie's theme. Not so in this film.  Instead we faced the polar opposite; guys getting shot and beaten up.  It was artistically done, and Bondworthy, if only there had been some lady silhouettes to balance it.This movie tries so hard to set itself apart from other Bond movies the way Batman Begins set itself apart from other Batman movies.  It worked for Batman Begins, but thats because the other Batman movies sucked for the most part.  There is nothing wrong with the rest of the Bond franchise as a whole (except for Lazenby).This new movie is also notably gritty and too realistic.  Other Bond movies had ridiculous plots, usually involving something in space (like the moon, or a satellite) or some distant island with a midget or maybe some lasers or advanced nuclear technology, and lets not forget Jaws Jackson or Oddjob.  This one had a less crazy plot about a private Banker stealing money from his clients and having some big Poker Tournament. Now less crazy isn't necessarily bad. At least it got rid of some of the camp in the Bond films.  But it still needs that element of Fantasy that makes it a modern spy movie.  There's no invisible car in this one, there's no remote control car either, and there's no laser guns or ethnic midgets.It feels unfulfilling to see everything that made Bond such a unique franchise go remiss in this newest installment.

Sure, you can run through drywall, but not without knowing what's on the other side! What idiot would try to run through a wall? Bond.It takes about an hour before the film decides to read the book, but then the film turns Bond into a dufus who can't think for himself and has to have women think for him and dress him, which is NOT any Bond we've ever known, in film nor book.Bond used to be a man's man..now, he's a feminist's sex symbol..you know, the incompetent guy who is eye candy for the women, but is incapable of self reliance and has to be corrected by the nearest woman at every turn because he can't think for himself and if he tries, then he's wrong. Bond's male audience doesn't want to watch Bond walk out of the ocean ala Ursula Andress. Only the homosexual screenwriters/director and women. Yet, that's what this film does. Also, Bond can't save himself in this film, but has to have women save him.The James Bond Theme song is mostly absent, which destroys the Bond feel. Bond no longer cares if his martini is shaken or stirred. The point of this film is to deconstruct and destroy Bond with only a superficial connection to the book. Anything that Bond would do is mocked, anything that a man would do is mocked. Anything that a women used to do in the older films is now done by a man.They said it was because this film was a new beginning. For the next film they blamed its shortcomings on MGM's bankruptcy. For Skyfall (you know, that generic action film that's missing the heart, soul and spirit of ANY James Bond in film and book where they tried to push homosexuality into Bond), they put the normal opening at the end, once again stating that it's because of a new beginning. I'm tired of their pathetic excuses.Bond is dead. Those now in charge are trying to turn him into a generic action figure that is no longer a man's man, but a feminist/homosexual idol to please the desires of the screenwriters and bankrupt Hollywood. Bond is now a generic feminist with no relation to Ian Fleming's Bond nor the Bond film history.As usual with the Bond films, they ignore the book for the most part, so there's still potential to make a lot of Bond films that actually follow the books.

This new release with Daniel Craig as the new Bond is simply a briliant comeback for a film franchise that, in terms of plots and iconic significance, was losing its appeal as the fossil of a cold war entertainment dinosaur.Here Casino Royale is revamped with a credible plot and a more dynamic Bond who is clearly a vulnerable human being rather than a superhero of the espionage world who never flinches.  Daniel Craig brings both vitality and vulnerability into the character of Bond and this brings a lot of tension into the story's plot.  Instead of just going through the motions of a predictable action-packed plot, Bond is filled with uncertainty as to the mission's players and ultimate success.  Judi Dench's cold beuraucratic and feminist ""M"" also adds a lot more tension into the plot than the franchise's previous stuffy and aristocratic ""M"" by virtue of her relationship to the still mysogenist Bond.

If you caught him in LAYER CAKE or MUNICH, you know he has an edge that is ruthless and sociopathic. The man looks and acts like a killer. This is the Bond that Fleming had in mind, and while Connery got close, even he wasn't this good. Forget everyone who followed, and to some extent that is a function of the writing as much as the acting. Not in this one, given the state of decline in the Bond series, it would all fall on Craig, and he delivers with deadly accuracy. If he does no more Bond films, he will have nonetheless rescued the franchise for the foreseeable future.But it isn't just him. Dench seems delighted to play a real woman in charge, and not someone doing walk-on ripostes witha cardboard actor. There is both palpable tension and sexual attraction to the interplay between M and Bond that teeters close to Oedipal undercurrents. Bond is a man with precious little conscience. This film goes a long way to explaining how and why. The villains are perfect: intelligent, duplicitous, treacherous thugs as ready to club and torture a victim as delight in the scheming and the betrayals. Who is really who eludes you throughout the film. The women are diabolical and intelligent. No bimbos. Each of the women is some projection of M, like a diamond turning and catching the light in its facets. Understandably, it isn't a direct line, but step back and consider when M appears in each scene and why, and there's as much going on here as there was in Silence of The Lambs. Except we have Vodka instead of Chianti.The movie is nearly free of product placement, and happily free of Cleese. He was never Q, and he should have been dropped a long time ago. Sony, Ford and Aston Martin make cameos, as does Bollinger, but all of them are less as prominent as they were with Brosnan, and never, ever get in the way. What happens to the Aston will break your heart, and maybe that's also the point. Everyone defined by their possessions is destroyed in this film.I don't want to say too much about it, other than you will read in some newspaper reviews that the card game seemed long. BS. It fairly flies and is so wrought with tension you'll find yourself holding your breath. The original book was based on the game of Baccarat and the financing of organized crime. This is poker and the financing of terrorism. Craig was determined ""to keep it real."" He did. In Spades. If you recall LAYER CAKE, about the last thing he says to the camera is ""and I never told you my name...."". Thus the theme song and the very final scene in this film resolve that.It is a long movie, but it has so much heart and soul, you won't want it to end. It's violent, no nonsense crime, spies and peril. The women are both sexual objects and radical challenges to his perception of himself. And if the producers know what's good for them, they will take the lessons of this film and carry them forward. When the James Bond Theme kicks in at the end of the film, everyone in the theatre applauded.

And I've seen them all.Daniel Craig had his doubters right from the minute it was announced that he was to take the role of 007, especially in the UK tabloid press. I personally couldn't work out what all the fuss was about (though one rumour suggested, completely ridiculously, that it was because he is blond and has blue eyes). I'd only ever seen him in one other role, in Steven Spielberg'sMunich (Widescreen Edition)and I thought he did a pretty decent job in that. I remember thinking at the time, let's give the dude a chance. Maybe he'll pull it off.Well, pull it off he did and while (sadly) there'll never be another Connery or Moore, or (thankfully), another Dalton or Brosnan, and while I accept that Craig might not have the smooth charm of any of his predecessors, he is edgier, grittier and much more believable than any of them as an agent in Her Majesty's secret spy service, MI6. This is definitely a 21st century Bond. He relies much more on his licence to kill than on smooth talking the ladies or on fancy gadgets (there's no Moneypenny or even a Q in this one) and when he does kill, he does it with a ruthless efficiency.This is an action packed thriller - the opening free running scenes with parkour supremo S&eacute;bastien Foucan alone are worth the price of the DVD - with most of the tension centred round a poker game played at the Casino that gives the movie its name. Judi Dench is her usual awesome self as M and I would say that Isaach De Bankole as the deadly Steven Obanno is also worth watching out for. The premise of this whole movie is that it takes place before Bond is ever given ""00"" status and I suppose that to make that premise authentic, the movie should've been based in the late 50s or early 60s or something but I'm not complaining. Period dramas never did it for me anyway. Purists may have anxieties about this new Bond, most especially about his raw brutality, but everything has to move on eventually.I say hats off to Daniel Craig for reinventing a role that was in danger of going stale.

I used to watch the marathons on TBS during summer vacation when I was in elementary school. (Marathons also watched include...Elvis musicals and Frankie Avalon beach movies.) Casino Royale has changed the texture of the Bond genre. Gone are the tired cliches of the classic James bond movies, we now get to see a little bit into the mind of James Bond (He has a mind?) and begin to understand his motivations.

1048606,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B000MNP2K8,Only-A-Child,"[8, 11]","It is appropriate that ""Casino Royale"", the first of the James Bond books (1953), would also be the first James Bond film to get a makeover. The original 1967 film was not just the black sheep of the series, but a bizarre departure from pretty much everything the franchise stood for. Which made it the best candidate for a remake which itself drastically breaks away from many Bond film conventions.The new ""Casino Royale"" represents a welcome invigoration of a series at a crossroads where it either had to reinvent itself or retire. As the least elaborate and most basic of Ian Fleming's series, the story adapts well to a gritty no-nonsense treatment. Basically it is the origin story of 007 and Daniel Craig, doing a reprise of his performance in ""Layer Cake"", steps in as the new (and the most like Fleming's original) Bond. He is more out-of-control dashing than suave and sophisticated.  While the young James Bond is immature and overconfident, he comes by these traits honestly being both a very competent and a very maladjusted young man. Which means a mean streak and a soft side unlike any Bond before him.Unlike the sound stage sets of the original ""Casino Royale"", the remake makes extensive use of exotic location shooting. The events in the films and the book center around a high stakes game (Texas hold-em poker here-baccarat in the others) as the villain Le Chiffre attempts to add funds to his agency's treasury at the gaming tables (the present day setting of the film requires the insertion of terrorist connections).For longtime fans of the franchise, Casino Royale offers some retro kicks. The film nicely blends virtuoso action sequences with sexy romance; and throws in a torture sequence more in the tradition of ""The Ipcress Files"" than ""Goldfinger.This is serious stuff, not the self-parody and cartoonish antics which had begun to dominate the productions even before the Brosnan era. At first the new direction might seem a considerable gamble, but while there was no guarantee of success the producers had little to lose except production costs because the franchise was so close to fading away. Something rugged and unconventional was needed and that is exactly what the new ""Casino Royale"" delivers.  The gritty opening scenes (featuring desaturated images) flashback to Bond as he is earning his 007 designation with brutal assassinations in a public bathroom and office. No silly gadgets (at least not really silly) or ""Man From UNCLE"" quips. There is a gray Aston Martin and the best car chase in Bond film history.The new Le Chiffre is no Orsen Welles; and must rely on a bleeding non-functional eye for his creepiness. The interplay between Bond and Vesper Lynds (Eva Green) works quite well.The writing team of Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and Paul Haggis provide a particularly nice script and it is fair to say that this version of ""Casino Royale"" ranks up there with the best of the series.Then again, what do I know?

One for newer generations, envisaginf always new adventures by renowned authors of the genre, like say, Tom Clancy, and another one, more classic in scope, reprising all Ian Fleming books as they were originally written and faithfully sticking to them.It would bring a whisk of fresh air into the franchise.The DVD containing the movie is well-made.

I have seen a few - not many - of the movies in this highly celebrated series and I have been relatively entertained. I think the more recent installments have been a little too much for me. I feel like James Bond is a role that needs to be overacted and cheesy, and I don't like it. With Casino Royale I was faced with an unpolished James Bond who still has an unabashed cockiness that gets him into trouble more often than it gets him out of it. That was the piece missing from the other James Bond movies. I really liked Casino Royale.I thought Daniel Craig did a fantastic job as James Bond, especially in the face of so much skepticism from the die-hard fanbase. He fit the mold of the unrefined hot shot very well. He was reckless and broke the rules. Maybe an imperfect James Bond is actually a more perfect James Bond. Think about it.The chase scene in Casino Royale can certainly rival that of most, if not all, other movies. At the beginning of the movie Bond must chase a man, but it is on foot rather than in cars. The pace of the chase coupled with the stunt work done for the scene were great.If you're a James Bond fan, I will assume you've already seen it. If you're not, like me, I think there is still plenty here if you like action/spy flicks.",5,I was very impressed.,1180483200,"05 30, 2007",2007,1300,"['am', 'admittedly', 'not', 'James', 'Bond', 'fan', 'have', 'seen', 'few', 'not', 'many', 'movies', 'highly', 'celebrated', 'series', 'have', 'been', 'relatively', 'entertained', 'think', 'more', 'recent', 'installments', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'feel', 'James', 'Bond', 'role', 'be', 'overacted', 'cheesy', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'was', 'faced', 'unpolished', 'James', 'Bond', 'who', 'still', 'unabashed', 'cockiness', 'trouble', 'more', 'often', 'was', 'piece', 'missing', 'other', 'James', 'Bond', 'movies', 'really', 'liked', 'Casino', 'Royale.I', 'thought', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'James', 'Bond', 'especially', 'face', 'so', 'much', 'skepticism', 'die-hard', 'fanbase', 'fit', 'mold', 'unrefined', 'hot', 'shot', 'very', 'well', 'was', 'reckless', 'broke', 'rules', 'Maybe', 'imperfect', 'James', 'Bond', 'actually', 'more', 'perfect', 'James', 'Bond', 'Think', 'it.The', 'chase', 'scene', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'can', 'certainly', 'rival', 'most', 'not', 'other', 'movies', 'beginning', 'movie', 'Bond', 'must', 'chase', 'man', 'foot', 'rather', 'cars', 'pace', 'chase', 'coupled', 'stunt', 'work', 'done', 'scene', 'were', 'great.If', ""'re"", 'James', 'Bond', 'fan', 'will', 'assume', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', ""'re"", 'not', 'think', 'still', 'plenty', 'here', 'like', 'action/spy', 'flicks']",N/A
1048622,A73W74K50GYRV,B000MNP2K8,PFunkster,"[6, 9]","As just an action movie, I might have rated Casino Royale higher.  Casino Royale, however, isn't just an action movie, it's a Bond movie.  Therefore my expectations are much higher and my rating much lower.The Bond movie that I found Casino Royale most comparable to was On Her Majestry's Secret Service.  In both movies Bond fell in love and had his heart broken when the women he fell for died at the end.In this comparison, I'm almost tempted to give On Her Majestry's Secret Service the edge.  Casino Royale was arguably a better action movie but I feel that On Her Majestry's Secret Service had more of the key ingredients that make a Bond movie a Bond movie, in spite of Bond getting married in it.The ingredients that I felt were lacking in Casino Royale were Bond's charm, humor, gadgets and, to be blunt, scantly clad women.  All three were sorely missed, especially the scantly clad women during the opening credits.  I think the movie would have been helped by John Cleese's return as R to give the movie both more humor and more gadgets.I understand that Casino Royale called or an edgier Bond but I find it hard to believe that Bond had to lose his charm in the process.  I don't know whether that was because of the script, the directing or Daniel Craig's acting.  I suspect that it was a combination of the three.I think the Bond enterprise will benefit by turning to Hugh Jackman when they decide to bring Bond's charm back.  It won't be the first time an Aussie played Bond (George Lazenby in On Her Majestry's Secret Service) and I think Hugh Jackman will return to James Bond the much needed charm that Sean Connery, Roger Moore and Pierce Bronson brought to the role.  In Casino Royale, I felt that charm was sorely missing.",2,Casino Royale Lacked Too Many Key Bond Ingredients,1178409600,"05 6, 2007",2007,1744,"['just', 'action', 'movie', 'might', 'have', 'rated', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'higher', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'however', ""n't"", 'just', 'action', 'movie', 'Bond', 'movie', 'Therefore', 'expectations', 'are', 'much', 'higher', 'rating', 'much', 'lower.The', 'Bond', 'movie', 'found', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'most', 'comparable', 'was', 'Her', 'Majestry', 'Secret', 'Service', 'movies', 'Bond', 'fell', 'love', 'had', 'heart', 'broken', 'when', 'women', 'fell', 'died', 'end.In', 'comparison', ""'m"", 'almost', 'tempted', 'give', 'Her', 'Majestry', 'Secret', 'Service', 'edge', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'was', 'arguably', 'better', 'action', 'movie', 'feel', 'Her', 'Majestry', 'Secret', 'Service', 'had', 'more', 'key', 'ingredients', 'make', 'Bond', 'movie', 'Bond', 'movie', 'spite', 'Bond', 'getting', 'married', 'it.The', 'ingredients', 'felt', 'were', 'lacking', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'were', 'Bond', 'charm', 'humor', 'gadgets', 'be', 'blunt', 'scantly', 'clad', 'women', 'three', 'were', 'sorely', 'missed', 'especially', 'scantly', 'clad', 'women', 'opening', 'credits', 'think', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'helped', 'John', 'Cleese', 'return', 'R', 'give', 'movie', 'more', 'humor', 'more', 'gadgets.I', 'understand', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'called', 'edgier', 'Bond', 'find', 'hard', 'believe', 'Bond', 'had', 'lose', 'charm', 'process', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'script', 'directing', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'acting', 'suspect', 'was', 'combination', 'three.I', 'think', 'Bond', 'enterprise', 'will', 'benefit', 'turning', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'when', 'decide', 'bring', 'Bond', 'charm', 'back', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'first', 'time', 'Aussie', 'played', 'Bond', 'George', 'Lazenby', 'Her', 'Majestry', 'Secret', 'Service', 'think', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'will', 'return', 'James', 'Bond', 'much', 'needed', 'charm', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'Roger', 'Moore', 'Pierce', 'Bronson', 'brought', 'role', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'felt', 'charm', 'was', 'sorely', 'missing']",N/A
1048623,A3S0IVFM83ZSE7,B000MNP2K8,P. Hardy,"[11, 16]","To be frank, I never really had any desire to watch Casino Royale. Two years ago (2006), I was quite content with pretending the movie never existed and that James Bond had died when Pierce Brosnan was fired. Nevertheless, somewhere around November 2007, I picked up my Mom's recorded DVD of the film (she recorded it for me, as she too, had no desire of wanting to see it either), I fell victim to my curiosity and stayed up until 4:00am in the morning watching it. Then near the end of the year (December 13th, 2007) I grabbed the decently priced official copy of Casino Royale and watched it again.Sufficed to say, the movie isn't bad, but it's not excellent either. To put simply, this is not ""Bond Begins"" in the general sense that Casino Royale is an origins film. Its not. (That ideal was obviously scrapped with EON failed to find themselves a young actor, under 22, and stumbled upon the realization that an film-based-Origin Story on a British secret agent life before he gained the License to Kill would not blow over as well as a two-hour film devoted simply to the Origin of Bruce Wayne, via Batman Begins). As we already know this is an entirely different Universe in the James Bond franchise, Casino Royale, is simply the beginning of James Bond's career as a 00-Agent set in what people love to call the ""Post-9/11 Era"". (Why movies like this and War of the Worlds are defined by that era, are beyond me.)The film begins with James Bond (Craig) confronting the corrupt MI6 section chief, Dryden in his office in Prague. This sequence is frequently interrupted with flashbacks showcasing Bond trying to kill Dryden's ""hit man"" in a shady looking bathroom. Both sequences end with the Dryden and the Hit man's death. Fast forward to the present, James is sent to Madagascar by MI6 to apprehend an ""international-bomb maker"" named Mollaka, with another MI6, Carter, (Joseph Millson).However, Mollaka catches sight of Bond's partner and makes a run for it. Carter attempts to pursue, but fails in his endeavor. James follows after the bomb-maker in his stead. This in ensues in one of three of the longest action sequences in the style of free running by Mollaka, while Bond struggles to keep up with the spry man. Once Mollaka is apprehended though, Bond sees fit to kill him, and blow up the front of African Embassy (as he already has what he came for). After a tongue lashing from M (Judi Dench), Bond heads to Miami to chase the trail of Alex Dimitrios -- fellow bomb maker, I believe -- which ensues into second of three big action sequences, when Bond discovers that Dimitrios' henchman plans to destroy an airplane own by Skyfleet. The sequence ends with another dead hired hand and more loose ends for MI6 to clean up, courtesy of James.Determined to get the bottom of this mess, M, sends James to Montenegro, accompanied by Vesper Lynn (Eva Green), a liaison agent from the HM Treasury's Financial Action Task Force, to enter a Poker Tournament at the Casino Royale. While he is there, Bond encounters and confronts Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen), a mathematical genius, [banker for terrorists] and the mastermind behind the events taking place in the film. Along the way, Bond allies himself with lone-wolf MI6 agent, Ren&eacute; Mathis (Giancarlo Giannini) who aids him in his mission, and CIA Agent Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright) when he looses the game to Le Chiffre.Given, that I've never read Casino Royale, I can't say whether or not if the modernized film is true to most of the events of the novel (but, given that this a film-adaptation, I'll assume it really isn't all that faithful). That aside, the opening sequence (Vector-Art Style) is probably the weakest since Tomorrow Never Dies. Except, instead of shadowed women and computer chip textures, you get poker chips and silhouetted men duking it out. Chris Cornell's ""You Know My Name"" suffers from the same water-downed audio that Cheryl Crow's title song did in the aforementioned film.Royale's biggest weakness are the action sequences; The first two are so over-the top (and entertaining the first time `round) that what little storyline there is lost in the blood, smoke, and debris. Your so caught up in watching the action sequences unfold, you hardly busy yourself to remember what the movie is about (why Bond is chasing ""Mollaka"" or ""Carlos"") until its all over and your wracking your head, trying to pick up where the storyline and plot fell off the speeding Aston Martin. This is one major problem at the end of the film, during an action sequence concerning a sinking building in Venice, Italy. You actually forget the reason why Bond is perusing Vesper and the men who have apprehended her.The scenes concerning the Poker game are the slowest and most uninteresting part of the film and makes up about half of the second hour of the film. There's also the subplot concerning one of the characters turning out to be a Double Agent working for Le Chiffre that could`ve been written a little better. There's no warning or hint to suggest that the character is so, Le Chiffre just announces it and that's that. The torture sequence critical reviews and magazines seemed to describe as excellent, is gloriously, over-glorified and overrated. The entire sequence was overacted on Daniel Craig's part (especially the ""scratch my balls"" quote.); I was latterly laughing and hiding my face in shame. The only compelling moment in that scene was the skittish composure of Mads Mikkelsen's character, Le Chiffre.Another problem with the film are the characters; The majority of them, mainly the focal characters, lack in depth personality (mostly due on the actors and actresses part) with the exception of Jeffery Wright, who portrays a very interesting Felix Leiter (a character whom I never encountered, until now), the only riveting part of the Poker Game sequences. Mads Mikkelsen portrays Le Chiffre in a mild and sinister manner that is quite appreciated, but his character hardly chalks up to anything besides a right hand man. Le Chiffre is hardly and a compelling villain and ends up sharing fate identical to Elektra King (portrayed Sophie Marceau) in The World is not enough, near the semi-end of the film. Judi Dench as ""M"", gives the usual performance of the hardnosed and no-nonsense head of MI6; I cannot help but enjoy every moment when she gives Bond the tongue-lashing over what he did in Madagascar, like she was scolding a schoolboy (ha-ha!).Eva Green as Vesper Lynd falls between average or charming enough to make you smile. However, Green's dry and monotone voice and delivery of lines are probably the most irritating part of her character. However, there are moments, [particularly when discussing ""Dinner Jackets"" or ""Financial Aid for James""], where personality inserts itself into Lynd. However, her romance with James Bond, in short, unbelievable. The chemistry between Green and Craig evaporates as soon as the two get together. Mostly, because, you know, James Bond will not be with her for long (thankfully).Of course, on the subject of Bond Girls in this film, it's nice to see that the film has decided to take the focus off the sexuality of the females and simply characterized them as people, even though they fall back into the position that they were meant for. Having sexual relations with James Bond (the sexual content in this film ironically is more PG-13 friendly than any of the previous films of Pierce Brosnan's Bond era).Daniel Craig as James Bond is all right at best. At times, he's charming (the scene when he drives around the hotel after inviting Solange to his ""home"" is an example), funny even. But, in all in all, Craig is not a very compelling actor for this role. For the most part, the majority of Daniel Craig's performance consists of going through the motions. Staring intensely at something or frowning in contemplation, or rattling his lines off in a monotone tone of voice like Eva Green. His James Bond is characterized like a true Thug or Hitman (obvious cues taken from movies like Munich and Layer Cake). Craig lacks the power of emotional range and that quirky personality that I loved from the previous Bonds (excluding Moore and Lazenby), continuity not withstanding here.Another irritating part of his character is the simple fact that he obviously acts before he thinks [hence the ""blunt instrument"" quote]; Bond made more mistakes than I've ever seen him make in one movie and his solution to the problem was a bullet from the gun or a dinner knife. He never thinks of the larger picture unless its to his benefit. EON's attempts to ""humanize"" the secret agent falls flat in places like the train scene where Vesper and James play tick-tat-toe with words to guess their character and upbringing or Bond's overly sappy speech that was featured in the theatrical trailer (*puke*) to Vesper. However, I think I do like him most when he attempts to comfort Vesper in the shower scene. When concerning his looks, Craig has never been the best looking or the most handsome man ever to grace the screens, so he makes up for it, with his acting. Overall, I like Daniel Craig as an actor, just not as James Bond. His demeanor just does not suit the character or the title.David Arnold has created a score for Casino Royale, which I have ended up loving. His previous endeavors for the James Bond films (1997-2002) were perfectly suited for the films, but as standalones, they were weak and uninspiring. Thankfully, this problem seems to be omitted and on its own, the score for Casino is an excellent listen. However, there are moments, where the more somber themes seemed forced, as they lacked a real emotional sound that failed to reach me.On one final note, the Second Disc containing all of the special features (which are about, three or four featurettes if memory serves) could've easily been slapped onto the Feature Film Disc. That said, aside from the featurette ""Bond Girls Are Forever"" (something I think I remember seeing on television or something), the other stuff is forgettable. Other than that, the Audio and Picture Quality of the DVD is standard ""DVD Perfection"" and clear on my television screen.Overall, Casino Royale is an entertaining Weekend Popcorn flick, but the fact that it takes itself too seriously and its atmosphere demands that you do as well, kills the enjoyment factor. In the end the movie's subplots and storylines never seem to come together to create a coherent story that works to the fullest and the characters could`ve been better developed in terms of personality. Factoids like ""Realism"" and ""Gritty, More Realistic Bond"" are instantly forgotten, because they have no presence in this film --- as Casino Royale is far from the quotations. Its just another Bond movie. ---- [3 out of 5]",3,"""They think I'm ugly but I'll have to live with that...""

Ever since pretty boy Roger Moore left his bland tenure as Bond, Bond flicks had become enjoyable again, with Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan bringing the franchise back to respectability again in movies with ACTUAL PLOTLINES, like ""The Living Daylights"", ""Goldeneye"" or ""The World Is Not Enough"". And now they were going to ""reboot"" the franchise with a new actor that just did NOT fit the mold as typically suave and debonair?? CHEZ INFAMIE!!However, ""Casino Royale"", and its followup, ""Quantum of Solace"", actually WORK!! In ""Casino"", based on the very first Bond novel by Ian Fleming, Bond earns his ""double O"" status within the first ten minutes of action in the teaser. He proceeds to track down a bomber somewhere in Uganda, offending ""M"" in the bargain, breaking into her apartment, hacking her computer and generally compromising her own little security capsule. Oddly enough, Judi Dench is held over as the head of MI6 in this film, even though she was Brosnan's ""M"", and we know that Bond had MALE ""M's"" before Brosnan. Oh, and here's another twist, for some reason, the gunsight intro doesn't take place until the movie ENDS in this one!Craig's Bond is a lot colder, a lot brasher....more along Timothy Dalton's line than either Moore, Brosnan OR Connery, but there IS the working class edge that Connery has....though I think, perhaps, Craig might have made a better Harry Palmer than ol' Jimmy Boy.

After watching the horrible Die Another Day I was a little afraid to watch Casino Royale. I took a risk and I'm glad I did because I really enjoyed this movie. This latest movie brings much needed life in to the James Bond Franchise which over the past few years had lost its edge. This is a new and improved Bond played by Daniel Craig. Daniel gives a great performance as 007, and his character actually has emotions and is not portrayed as this one dimensional robot like the previous films. The action scenes in this movie are great, and to see James Bond fall in love just adds to the drama of this movie.  I don't want to give the movie away so I will say no more. This movie has some slow moments in it, but for the most part it is a good, entertaining, action packed movie. The Blu-ray disc picture looks amazing in true 1080p HD, and the sound is top notch as well if you choose the linear PCM 5.1 soundtrack.

1048648,A21ITRDVUIOLMW,B000MNP2K8,Red Sapphire,"[1, 2]","James Bond in both Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace is almost macabre in the way he is always covered in someone else's blood, the way blood often oozes from opened cuts on his face and his hands with his not caring in the least that it does. He's the right degree of handsome--or not--for the masses who are ""anti"" good-looking leading men.  But for me, Bond's greatest attributes are that he is vulnerable and that emotionally, he bleeds, in ways so subtle, they're almost subliminal.  His emotions surface  and then are  swallowed  up, lost, in the next frantic chase, fight or mind game.  But during their surfacing, they are so intense that they linger in the air like invisible tangibleness, and when the movie ends, you still remember a certain cold look, a distancing expression, or words, like a well-mixed drink, spoken with a shot of anger and a shot of the inability to mask the pain.I did miss the Bond gadgets, but the one liners were still in there, though not the deliberately funny ones like in previous Bond movies.  This Bond doesn't have a ""tell"" that gives away the fact he's about to say something funny. The line just comes out naturally, and sometimes, it takes the viewer a minute to realize the joke.  It's a new and difference approach, and I think it works well.As for the overall movie, some of the scenes in it just have to be watched over and over again. They are just that good. I don't mean only the action scenes. That shower scene rivals  The Age of Innocence on any given day.  And there are others. Each viewer will pick his or her own.  My recommendation is to watch this movie. Daniel Craig is so good in this picture. I read some of the Bond books, and like Ian Fleming's character, Craig's Bond is both a human being and an incredibly cold and dangerous machine, while not allowing one side of himself to detract or distract from the other.I gave the movie five stars because overall it was enjoyable. The only problem I had with it was what happened in the end with Vesper and why it happened.

1048649,A31U2QT7SAL7K,B000MNP2K8,"Reginald D. Garrard ""the G-man""","[3, 5]","I recall that many a naysayer ranted and raved when Michael Keaton was hired to play Batman/Bruce Wayne in the first of the big-budgeted exploits of the Dark Knight. How could the actor, known to moviegoers as ""Beetlejuice,"" possibly get away with playing the legendary superhero? However, Keaton excelled in the role and even returned in the first sequel.Well, the same crowd was probably upset with the hiring of Daniel Craig as the new 007. The guy is blond and more than likely is the shortest actor to assay the role. And Craig had never carried a film on his name alone.After seeing the film, I can attest that Craig should have no problems with being a headliner now. His interpretation of the role has brought life to a franchise that was becomingly increasingly far-fetched and somewhat boring. Pierce Bronson, Craig's immediate predecessor, had done well in the part but he was saddled with two good films (""Goldeneye"" and ""The World is Not Enough"") and two mediocre ones (""Tomorrow Never Dies,"" and ""Die Another Day"").It was, indeed, time for a ""changing of the guard.""Craig's Bond is a combination of virility and vulnerability. He is appropriately strong yet shows weakness, especially when his superego gets the best of him. One can't imagine Connery ever losing a card game, as does Craig in this film.Craig obviously worked hard to buff himself up for the part, physically and mentally. His confident swagger as he enters a room is enough to make all heads turn.As far as the film is concerned, there are two extremely exciting chases: an unbelievable (and quite long) romp through a Madagascar city, filled with a jaw-dropping fight above on a construction crane and a fast-paced race along the runways of Miami International Airport.The stuntmen really earned their respective paychecks for both of these.Kudos must be given to director Martin Campbell for keeping the two-hour-plus film moving at a brisk pace.  And the screenplay co-authored by Robert Wade, Paul Haggis, and Neal Purvis brings new life to a character that has been around since the early days of ""The Cold War,"" to borrow a line delivered by one of the key players.There is homage to earlier Bonds, direct and subtle. Craig wins a somewhat familiar '64 Aston Martin in a card game. And at the climactic game between LaChiffre (Mads Mikkelson) and Bond, there is an extremely large African-American player at the table. One might wonder if his presence is a tribute to the late Orson Welles who played LaChiffre in the earlier Woody Allen/David Niven Bond spoof.Even David Arnold, the composer of music for each of the Brosnan Bond films, seems to have intentionally constructed a score eerily similar to the classic ones composed by John Barry.As far as the other performers are concerned, Dame Judi Dench is again authoritative and impressive as ""M,"" while Eva Green is captivating as ""Vesper Lind,"" Bond's associate and eventual conquest. Hopefully, Jeffery Wright will be better used in the next film for his part is no more than a glorified cameo.This Bond is the film of which all its successors will be measured and Craig is, undeniably, the best actor to inhabit the role since Connery's departure.And I hate to say that 'cause I'm a big fan of Roger Moore!!!",5,"""The BOND is Craig, Daniel Craig!""",1165017600,"12 2, 2006",2006,3253,"['recall', 'many', 'naysayer', 'ranted', 'raved', 'when', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'was', 'hired', 'play', 'Batman/Bruce', 'Wayne', 'first', 'big-budgeted', 'exploits', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'How', 'could', 'actor', 'known', 'moviegoers', 'Beetlejuice', 'possibly', 'get', 'away', 'playing', 'legendary', 'superhero', 'However', 'Keaton', 'excelled', 'role', 'even', 'returned', 'first', 'sequel.Well', 'same', 'crowd', 'was', 'probably', 'upset', 'hiring', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'new', '007', 'guy', 'blond', 'more', 'likely', 'shortest', 'actor', 'assay', 'role', 'Craig', 'had', 'never', 'carried', 'film', 'name', 'alone.After', 'seeing', 'film', 'can', 'attest', 'Craig', 'should', 'have', 'problems', 'being', 'headliner', 'now', 'interpretation', 'role', 'brought', 'life', 'franchise', 'was', 'becomingly', 'increasingly', 'far-fetched', 'somewhat', 'boring', 'Pierce', 'Bronson', 'Craig', 'immediate', 'predecessor', 'had', 'done', 'well', 'part', 'was', 'saddled', 'two', 'good', 'films', 'Goldeneye', 'World', 'Not', 'Enough', 'two', 'mediocre', 'ones', 'Tomorrow', 'Never', 'Die', 'Day', '.It', 'was', 'indeed', 'time', 'changing', 'guard', 'Craig', 'Bond', 'combination', 'virility', 'vulnerability', 'appropriately', 'strong', 'yet', 'weakness', 'especially', 'when', 'superego', 'best', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'Connery', 'ever', 'losing', 'card', 'game', 'Craig', 'film.Craig', 'obviously', 'worked', 'hard', 'buff', 'up', 'part', 'physically', 'mentally', 'confident', 'swagger', 'room', 'enough', 'make', 'heads', 'turn.As', 'far', 'film', 'concerned', 'are', 'two', 'extremely', 'exciting', 'chases', 'unbelievable', 'quite', 'long', 'romp', 'Madagascar', 'city', 'filled', 'jaw-dropping', 'fight', 'construction', 'crane', 'fast-paced', 'race', 'runways', 'Miami', 'International', 'Airport.The', 'stuntmen', 'really', 'earned', 'respective', 'paychecks', 'these.Kudos', 'must', 'be', 'given', 'director', 'Martin', 'Campbell', 'keeping', 'two-hour-plus', 'film', 'moving', 'brisk', 'pace', 'screenplay', 'co-authored', 'Robert', 'Wade', 'Paul', 'Haggis', 'Neal', 'Purvis', 'new', 'life', 'character', 'been', 'early', 'days', 'Cold', 'War', 'borrow', 'line', 'delivered', 'one', 'key', 'homage', 'earlier', 'Bonds', 'direct', 'subtle', 'Craig', 'somewhat', 'familiar', ""'64"", 'Aston', 'Martin', 'card', 'game', 'climactic', 'game', 'LaChiffre', 'Mads', 'Mikkelson', 'Bond', 'extremely', 'large', 'African-American', 'player', 'table', 'One', 'might', 'wonder', 'presence', 'tribute', 'late', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'who', 'played', 'LaChiffre', 'earlier', 'Woody', 'Allen/David', 'Niven', 'Bond', 'spoof.Even', 'David', 'Arnold', 'composer', 'music', 'Brosnan', 'Bond', 'films', 'have', 'intentionally', 'constructed', 'score', 'eerily', 'similar', 'classic', 'ones', 'composed', 'John', 'Barry.As', 'far', 'other', 'performers', 'are', 'concerned', 'Dame', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'again', 'authoritative', 'impressive', 'M', 'Eva', 'Green', 'captivating', 'Vesper', 'Lind', 'Bond', 'associate', 'eventual', 'conquest', 'Hopefully', 'Jeffery', 'Wright', 'will', 'be', 'better', 'used', 'next', 'film', 'part', 'more', 'glorified', 'cameo.This', 'Bond', 'film', 'successors', 'will', 'be', 'measured', 'Craig', 'undeniably', 'best', 'actor', 'inhabit', 'role', 'Connery', 'departure.And', 'hate', 'say', ""'cause"", ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'Roger', 'Moore']",N/A

1048656,A16GJQ27XTZLLE,B000MNP2K8,"Rick Seals ""Transplanted OKie""","[0, 0]","I have to admit up front that I have a strong bias about the way I think James Bond should be portrayed. I like the old Ian Fleming style of Bond who is true to the books. We are talking a very serious Bond who is macho, resourceful and more than a little bit vengeful when he feels like he has been wronged. At the same time, the classic Bond of the Ian Fleming novels that I look for also sets the ladies on fire and is soo unafraid of his enemies that he literally laughs at them even as they appear to have his life in their hands. This guy never loses his cool and is the epitome of the word. He used to go by Sean Connery when off-camera but I feel very comfortable now saying that he goes by Daniel Craig these days.In Casino Royale, we have a nice, modernized take on the very first of Flemings' Bond adventures. To summarize without giving away more than just basic plot devices for those who have not yet watched this movie, Bond is on a mission to smoke out a powerful money launderer who takes money and invests it for terrorist groups and other criminal organizations. Basically he demonstrates classic Bond wit by tricking his rival into losing all of his money in a game of chance which makes him a marked man by all the organizations he is a front for, rendering him an easy target for capture and use as an informant. Bond succeeds and in the process he manages to get into quite a few fights on the side. Despite being injured, again in classic-Bond style, he manages to get back to the table in no time flat and even clean up as if he never left his martini. The ladies fall for him and Bond himself, breaking one of his own rules to never fall for a lady, falls hard for his assistant, fellow MI6 agent Vesper Lynd. When she turns out to be a double-agent (not by her own choice), Bond goes on a rampage and is left scarred in the end. I should say more scarred as Bond is always a man who has a chip on his shoulder.Craig hits the ground running in this his first journey into the BondVerse. He pulls off the character with a nice showing of suave but also with a serious dedication to dark justice right out of the novels, a cross between Connery's smooth demeanor and the more violent Bond of the Timothy Dalton years. The atmosphere, the music, the story and the acting is amazing and all seem to fall into place right where they belong. This is instantly one of my favorite Bond adventures.The video and sound qualities are quite good, this being a recent hit release. I found no trouble here whatsoever- everything was crystal clear. I have read some reviews elsewhere of people having trouble watching this movie and others on certain players but on the PS3 it was just like at the theater as far as I was concerned.ConclusionIn short, buy this movie. If you like James Bond at all you will enjoy it. If you are like me and enjoy the more serious Bond of Connery and Dalton over the somewhat more comedic and slap-stick Roger Moore years, you will absolutely love it. I never knock anyone who played James Bond and for good reason- Double-O-7's shoes are very hard to fill. From a long-time fan's point of view though, this movie gets it right and is worth a look.",5,"A Nice, Modern Retooling Of A Classic Bond Adventure",1336176000,"05 5, 2012",2012,3191,"['have', 'admit', 'up', 'front', 'have', 'strong', 'bias', 'way', 'think', 'James', 'Bond', 'should', 'be', 'portrayed', 'like', 'old', 'Ian', 'Fleming', 'style', 'Bond', 'who', 'true', 'books', 'are', 'talking', 'very', 'serious', 'Bond', 'who', 'macho', 'resourceful', 'more', 'little', 'bit', 'vengeful', 'when', 'been', 'wronged', 'same', 'time', 'classic', 'Bond', 'Ian', 'Fleming', 'novels', 'look', 'also', 'ladies', 'fire', 'soo', 'unafraid', 'enemies', 'literally', 'even', 'appear', 'have', 'life', 'hands', 'guy', 'never', 'cool', 'epitome', 'word', 'used', 'go', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'when', 'off-camera', 'feel', 'very', 'comfortable', 'now', 'saying', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'days.In', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'have', 'nice', 'modernized', 'take', 'very', 'first', 'Flemings', 'Bond', 'adventures', 'summarize', 'giving', 'away', 'more', 'just', 'basic', 'plot', 'devices', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'watched', 'movie', 'Bond', 'mission', 'smoke', 'out', 'powerful', 'money', 'launderer', 'who', 'money', 'terrorist', 'groups', 'other', 'criminal', 'organizations', 'Basically', 'classic', 'Bond', 'wit', 'tricking', 'rival', 'losing', 'money', 'game', 'chance', 'marked', 'man', 'organizations', 'front', 'rendering', 'easy', 'target', 'capture', 'use', 'informant', 'Bond', 'process', 'get', 'quite', 'few', 'fights', 'side', 'being', 'injured', 'again', 'classic-Bond', 'style', 'get', 'back', 'table', 'time', 'flat', 'even', 'clean', 'up', 'as', 'never', 'left', 'martini', 'ladies', 'fall', 'Bond', 'breaking', 'one', 'own', 'rules', 'never', 'fall', 'lady', 'hard', 'assistant', 'fellow', 'MI6', 'agent', 'Vesper', 'Lynd', 'When', 'out', 'be', 'double-agent', 'not', 'own', 'choice', 'Bond', 'rampage', 'left', 'scarred', 'end', 'should', 'say', 'more', 'scarred', 'Bond', 'always', 'man', 'who', 'chip', 'shoulder.Craig', 'ground', 'running', 'first', 'journey', 'BondVerse', 'character', 'nice', 'showing', 'suave', 'also', 'serious', 'dedication', 'dark', 'justice', 'right', 'novels', 'cross', 'Connery', 'smooth', 'demeanor', 'more', 'violent', 'Bond', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'years', 'atmosphere', 'music', 'story', 'acting', 'amazing', 'seem', 'fall', 'place', 'right', 'where', 'belong', 'instantly', 'one', 'favorite', 'Bond', 'adventures.The', 'video', 'sound', 'qualities', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'being', 'recent', 'hit', 'release', 'found', 'trouble', 'here', 'whatsoever-', 'everything', 'was', 'crystal', 'clear', 'have', 'read', 'reviews', 'elsewhere', 'people', 'having', 'trouble', 'watching', 'movie', 'others', 'certain', 'players', 'PS3', 'was', 'just', 'theater', 'as', 'far', 'was', 'concerned.ConclusionIn', 'short', 'buy', 'movie', 'like', 'James', 'Bond', 'will', 'enjoy', 'are', 'enjoy', 'more', 'serious', 'Bond', 'Connery', 'Dalton', 'somewhat', 'more', 'comedic', 'slap-stick', 'Roger', 'Moore', 'years', 'will', 'absolutely', 'love', 'never', 'knock', 'anyone', 'who', 'played', 'James', 'Bond', 'good', 'reason-', 'Double-O-7', 'shoes', 'are', 'very', 'hard', 'fill', 'long-time', 'fan', 'point', 'view', 'movie', 'right', 'look']",N/A

Plus I'll get a big pile of ""not helpful"" votes, but I feel this has to be said: Casino Royale has a terrible screenplay, I've never read the book, but I cant possibly see how the storyline could be as bad as it is in the film. I sat through the lame 10 minute long opening credit sequence then the first 40 minutes of the movie and thought to myself, what has really happened so far?  People have come and gone, money has changed hands... and I really dont care about anybody in the movie.This movie could have easily be cut down to 1:20 and not the 2 hour marathon that it ends up as.  I found myself about an hour into it waiting for the credits to roll.  I didnt care about any character in the movie yet it kept carrying on and on.  The poker sequences could have been cut down 1/4 the length they are.  I understand Texas Hold'em is big all the sudden, but Bond was a Baccarat guy.  They waste a lot of time on poker in this movie trying to turn this into Rounders 2.  Hey I love Hold'em as much as the next guy, point of reference my reviews on many Hold'em related books, but this isnt the WPT or WSOP, its Bond.. I'm here for action and babes, not to watch a grind.They also have the lead Bond chick cast incorrectly.  The one that should be the main girl is the one that was the girlfriend of the first villan.  The main girl is cute and cleans up nice in the poker scene to do nothing more than hold up the bar in case it were to suddenly fall over, but seriously.. she's not all that.  The worst thing of all is Bond falls in freeekin love with her!  Come one, he's always been the king of ""hit it and quit it"".  Now he's Richie Cuddingham.I know everyone out there is comparing this to the Batman and Superman franchises saying this is the resurrection of Bond.  Honestly, I dont see anywhere near the presence in this Bond compared to our replacement Batman and Superman.  Its nice that they've dumped the slap stick humor, but they could have used a better lead.  Hugh Grant could have been a better Bond and I hate that guy's movies with the fire of a thousand suns.Possible SPOILER:  I was really getting bored when a never ending string of villans parade through the film with little in the way of character building and make an abrupt exit.  The last villan, who seems to be the most important has the least explained about him.  Things just got so predictable after a while.  The storyline is very shallow and I'm now interested in reading the book to see if it was really meant to be this dull.This movie left me looking for a comparison on how something could have turned out worse and I thought of one.

No gizmo's and gadgets either. What happened to Q?. Craig is good.  Very athletic and limber and all that but really, too damn stiff and straight as a Bond.  No swagger.  His time with the babes (what there were of them) was almost uncomfortable to watch. Doesnt come across as a ladies man. I do admit that this film has one of the best footrrace chase scenes I've ever seen. Awesum!! This was more or less like watching another Mission Impossible sequel. Lots of action packed this and that,stuff blowing up and all but missing the true signiture of Bond. James Bond. They didn't even get his favorite martini right either. I think someone is trying (yet again) to rewrite, rework and rebuild the Bond we all grew up with. Leave it alone. Stop trying to make whats perfect ""even better and more exciting"".

1048659,AHBNPMHDWZ7SB,B000MNP2K8,RJ Smoove,"[1, 1]","I imagine something along these lines happened in a nice boardroom in one of the office buildings on the Sony Pictures studio lot: It's June 2002, and audiences across the nation are being swept off their feet by a deadly government assassin with a serious case of the forgetfuls. There's a deadly agent that people are falling in love with, who has ""J.B."" as his initials, and it ain't James Bond. I imagine that didn't sit well with those suits in that boardroom, and it promptly urged them to begin their search for the next British actor to don the classic black tux and shaken, not stirred, martini. Fast-forward four years, to 2006, and we arrive at Casino Royale. After saying all of that, I still have to admit that Casino Royale is one hell of a remarkable film. Daniel Craig is exactly what I feel James Bond should be. It's funny that not many people had faith in him, until they saw the movie for themselves. I really wanted to see an actor put a new twist on the character, rather than copying the tried and true smooth-talking 'Bond, James Bond' from the older movies. I have to say, Daniel Craig did not disappoint me in the slightest. He radiates cool, and badassery, while managing to eliminate the main thing that I had problem with in older 007's. The over-the-top gadgets were the only thing that prevented me from loving earlier Bond films, as silly as that may sound. I just could never take them seriously in the contexts of the films.For instance, the car that could become invisible and the surf boards with weapon compartments in Die Another Day, and the wheelchair with a missle as a leg cast in GoldenEye, just to name a couple. I'm not very familiar with the oldest Bond movies, but I'm pretty sure they had even whackier gadgets than that. Anyway, the closer to realism, the better, in my opinion. At least for this particular property. I would not say that philosophy translates to every rebooted franchise out there, but I certainly think that mentality has worked wonders for this one. I thoroughly enjoyed the action sequences in Casino Royale, as well. They were very extreme, yet remained so believable. One of my favorite movie scenes of all time is the scene when Bond parkour chases the bomb maker in Madagascar. That scene was so mind-numbingly awesome that I immediately realized that something special was in out midst. Ironically, action is not this film's only strong point. I also love the tension, especially in the poker scenes. To this day, those moments make my heart rate increase slightly. No spoiler intended, but in one scene Bond's heart rate gets a bit of a boost as well. To further adress my inference that the Bourne series was an inspiration for this one to be rebooted the way it was, I want to add that I never got a Bourne vibe from this film. This movie more than stands on its own two feet, and did not copy Bourne in any way. I just credit the Bourne series for inspiring the producers and filmmakers to revamp this franchise the way they did.I so love the way this movie came from basically nowhere, to pretty much blew the minds of fans around the world. It reminds me of what Wb, Christopher Nolan, and Batman Begins did for the Batman franchise. All I can say is, thank God for Jason Bourne. If Bourne had not come along and set a new bar for secret agent/government assassin action thrillers, I seriously doubt that 007 would have been rebooted with such a vengence. And boy was it. Casino Royale actually surpasses all of its predecessors (at least the ones I have actually seen) and the Bourne series. In my humble opinion, it's a near perfect masterpiece.

1048660,A3BJDFGSLXFB36,B000MNP2K8,R. Legendre,"[3, 5]","I have been a Bond fan for nearly 30 years now. I've seen many Bonds come and go and have appreciated what each actor has brought to the role.When I heard Daniel Craig had been cast as 007, I had my doubts. I had seen him in Layer Cake and Road to Perdition and felt that he really didn't LOOK the part. I know that looks can be deceiving. Case in point is Michael Keaton in 1989's Batman. I thought that was the worst casting decision in the history of film.....until I SAW the movie. Keaton ended up being PERFECT in the role.The same goes for Craig. Daniel Craig is masterful as James Bond. Many of the Daniel Criag detractors felt that Craig portrayed bond as an unrefined thug.That was the point of the whole film. Remember, Casino Royale is bringing the Bond franchise back to its roots. Bond has just become a ""00"" and isn't the seasoned agent that we've all come to know and love over the years.Yes, Craig's Bond is brutish. If you notice, in many scenes he doesn't wear a suit and tie (except for the casino scenes) and even goes around with his shirt untucked in some cases. He's certainly not the dapper British agent in all of the previous films.Also, when asked if he wanted his vodka martini shaken or stirred, he responds that he doesn't give a damn. What? Again, remember, he is unrefined and unseasoned, not a suave, sophisticated super-spy.Now. Fast forward to the end of the film when the villain behind it all asks him ""Who are you?""We see Bond dressed to the nines in a fantastic suit and tie as he replies ""Bond. James Bond.""That sums it all up. Bond is seasoned now. He's been through a lot and knows that he's got to ""tighten up"" if he's going to survive as a ""00"".The next film, which I am greatly looking forward to, will most likely show a more sophisticated, cultured and refined Bond. He may still have some rough edges (he can't become a brute one day and a perfect gentleman the next; that proess should take a little time), but he should be closer to the traditional Bond we've all known since the '60s.One thing I REALLY appreciated was the story. Previous Bond films have been extremely outrageous (Die Another Day: a hotel sculpted out of ice, a villain with a ""shock suit"", an invisible BMW, an evil henchman named Mr. Kill.....puh-lease!) This story is better rooted in reality than some of the other Bond films which I think brings more credibility to the franchise. I think we're all getting a little tired of the ""master villain wants to cause a nuclear war and dominate the world"" theme. That type of story has been done to DEATH.As for the DVD itself, the extras are good but not great. It was nice, though, for Myram D'Abo (Kara from The Living Daylights) to interview the Bond girls through the ages; a very nice, nostalgic touch.The picture is excellent and the sound is very good although not top-notch. I found some of the dialogue difficult to hear, so I turned up the volume. When the action scenes came, I had to turn the volume back down because the movie then became way too loud.Overall, an excellent purchase and an excellent film. Even if you're not a James Bond fan, you will still enjoy this movie.",5,Best Bond film in YEARS,1181865600,"06 15, 2007",2007,3155,"['have', 'been', 'Bond', 'fan', 'nearly', '30', 'years', 'now', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', 'Bonds', 'come', 'go', 'have', 'appreciated', 'what', 'actor', 'brought', 'role.When', 'heard', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'had', 'been', 'cast', '007', 'had', 'doubts', 'had', 'seen', 'Layer', 'Cake', 'Road', 'Perdition', 'felt', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'LOOK', 'part', 'know', 'can', 'be', 'deceiving', 'Case', 'point', 'Michael', 'Keaton', '1989', 'Batman', 'thought', 'was', 'worst', 'casting', 'decision', 'history', 'film', '..until', 'SAW', 'movie', 'Keaton', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'PERFECT', 'role.The', 'same', 'Craig', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'masterful', 'James', 'Bond', 'Many', 'Daniel', 'Criag', 'detractors', 'felt', 'Craig', 'portrayed', 'bond', 'unrefined', 'was', 'point', 'whole', 'film', 'Remember', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'bringing', 'Bond', 'franchise', 'back', 'roots', 'Bond', 'just', 'become', '00', ""n't"", 'seasoned', 'agent', ""'ve"", 'come', 'know', 'love', 'years.Yes', 'Craig', 'Bond', 'brutish', 'notice', 'many', 'scenes', ""n't"", 'wear', 'suit', 'tie', 'casino', 'scenes', 'even', 'around', 'shirt', 'untucked', 'cases', 'certainly', 'not', 'dapper', 'British', 'agent', 'previous', 'films.Also', 'when', 'asked', 'wanted', 'vodka', 'martini', 'shaken', 'stirred', ""n't"", 'give', 'damn', 'What', 'Again', 'remember', 'unrefined', 'unseasoned', 'not', 'suave', 'sophisticated', 'super-spy.Now', 'Fast', 'forward', 'end', 'film', 'when', 'villain', 'Who', 'are', 'see', 'Bond', 'dressed', 'nines', 'fantastic', 'suit', 'tie', 'Bond', 'James', 'Bond', 'sums', 'up', 'Bond', 'seasoned', 'now', 'been', 'lot', 'got', 'tighten', 'up', 'going', 'survive', '00', '.The', 'next', 'film', 'am', 'greatly', 'looking', 'forward', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'show', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'cultured', 'refined', 'Bond', 'may', 'still', 'have', 'rough', 'edges', 'ca', ""n't"", 'become', 'brute', 'one', 'day', 'perfect', 'gentleman', 'next', 'proess', 'should', 'take', 'little', 'time', 'should', 'be', 'closer', 'traditional', 'Bond', ""'ve"", 'known', ""'60s.One"", 'thing', 'REALLY', 'appreciated', 'was', 'story', 'Previous', 'Bond', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'extremely', 'outrageous', 'Die', 'Day', 'hotel', 'sculpted', 'ice', 'villain', 'shock', 'suit', 'invisible', 'BMW', 'evil', 'henchman', 'named', 'Mr', 'Kill', '..puh-lease', 'story', 'better', 'rooted', 'reality', 'other', 'Bond', 'films', 'think', 'brings', 'more', 'credibility', 'franchise', 'think', ""'re"", 'getting', 'little', 'tired', 'master', 'villain', 'cause', 'nuclear', 'war', 'dominate', 'world', 'theme', 'type', 'story', 'been', 'done', 'DEATH.As', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'was', 'nice', 'though', 'Myram', ""D'Abo"", 'Kara', 'Living', 'Daylights', 'interview', 'Bond', 'girls', 'ages', 'very', 'nice', 'nostalgic', 'touch.The', 'picture', 'excellent', 'sound', 'very', 'good', 'not', 'top-notch', 'found', 'dialogue', 'difficult', 'hear', 'turned', 'up', 'volume', 'When', 'action', 'scenes', 'came', 'had', 'turn', 'volume', 'back', 'down', 'movie', 'then', 'became', 'way', 'too', 'loud.Overall', 'excellent', 'purchase', 'excellent', 'film', 'Even', ""'re"", 'not', 'James', 'Bond', 'fan', 'will', 'still', 'enjoy', 'movie']",N/A
1048661,A188KU3SI543V3,B000MNP2K8,"rnorton828 ""rnorton828""","[1, 4]","In 2002, Paramount Pictures attempted to reinvent the film franchise based on Tom Clancy's series of Jack Ryan novels with the release of The Sum of All Fears.  Ben Affleck was cast as a young Jack Ryan beginning his CIA career as an analyst.  But a horrible script and lackluster performances from many of the film's cast members made The Sum of All Fears an abysmal failure.Fast forward to 2006, as MGM, Columbia Pictures and Eon Productions attempt to reinvent the James Bond franchise based on author Ian Fleming's 007 novels with the release of Casino Royale.  Daniel Craig was cast in the role of Bond, following in the footsteps of Sean Connery, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan, with actress Eva Green cast as Vesper Lynd.  Bond film veteran Judi Dench is the only 007 alum to return as she steps into the role of MI6 chief ""M"" once again.  Martin Campbell, who directed Brosnan's debut, GoldenEye, returns to the director's chair for the twenty-first Bond film.In Casino Royale, Daniel Craig portrays a younger, blonder James Bond early in his MI6 career.  The film opens with Bond obtaining his first two kills, an event that elevates him to double-0 status as he gains his license to kill.  The music score keeps the use of the traditional 007 theme to a minimum, but that's a good thing in this movie.  This film is the story of how Bond becomes Bond.Craig plays 007 with great confidence and proves himself a worthy successor to the role.  While Dalton brought acting credibility to the part, he never seemed fully comfortable in the role.  Roger Moore was Ian Fleming's original choice prior to Connery's landing the part.  But when Moore did assume the role, he came off more as parody than a regular Bond.  Brosnan was acceptable as 007, but his physique (or lack thereof) made it difficult for fans to believe that he was capable of engaging in the fights and other physical scenes constantly shown in Bond films.  Sean Connery has always been my favorite Bond, but Daniel Craig has already established himself as a very close second.For the first time since 1987's The Living Daylights, we have a Bond film that is actually based on one of Ian Fleming's books.  Mads Mikkelsen makes a great villain as Le Chiffre, a banker to many of the world's terrorist organizations.  ""M"" wants to put Le Chiffre under great financial pressure, forcing him to turn to MI6 for amnesty.  This leads to Montenegro where he hosts a high stakes poker tournament, seeking to recoup his recent losses to cover the investments of his clients.  Bond enters the tournament on a mission to clean out Le Chiffre.  007 having been set up with a $10 million stake by the British government.  Vesper Lynd is a British treasury agent assigned to watch over Bond and the government's money.Many elements of past Bond films are missing from Casino Royale--no ""Q,"" no Miss Moneypenny--and many of the tongue-in-cheek one-liners are now gone as well.  This movie gets back to the beginning of Bond, as we see a reckless 007 who has not yet become confident in his skills and abilities.  The over-the-top action sequences of many previous Bond films have been replaced with a much darker tone.  And the tragic relationship between Bond and Vesper gives us insight into why he traditionally does not allow women to get close to him.This two-disc DVD set contains several bonus features of note, including two original featurettes:  ""Becoming Bond,"" which examines how Daniel Craig became the sixth Bond; and ""James Bond: For Real,"" which provides an inside look at the movie's action sequences and stunts.  Also included is an updated version of ""Bond Girls are Forever,"" hosted by Maryam d'Abo (Kara Milovny in The Living Daylights) plus the obligatory music video for Chris Cornell's theme song ""You Know My Name.""With such superb work from the cast and crew of this movie, Casino Royale seems to have breathed new life into the James Bond franchise.  This could very well be the best 007 movie since 1965's Thunderball.  Daniel Craig has done an excellent job in his first outing as Bond, outshining four of his five predecessors.  Provided that the writing and direction continue to be this good, I look forward to watching Craig in future 007 films over the next few years.",5,Casino Royale:  Bond Begins,1174953600,"03 27, 2007",2007,4291,"['2002', 'Paramount', 'Pictures', 'attempted', 'reinvent', 'film', 'franchise', 'based', 'Tom', 'Clancy', 'series', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'novels', 'release', 'Sum', 'All', 'Fears', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'was', 'cast', 'young', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'beginning', 'CIA', 'career', 'analyst', 'horrible', 'script', 'lackluster', 'performances', 'many', 'film', 'cast', 'members', 'made', 'Sum', 'All', 'Fears', 'abysmal', 'failure.Fast', 'forward', '2006', 'MGM', 'Columbia', 'Pictures', 'Eon', 'Productions', 'attempt', 'reinvent', 'James', 'Bond', 'franchise', 'based', 'author', 'Ian', 'Fleming', '007', 'novels', 'release', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'was', 'cast', 'role', 'Bond', 'following', 'footsteps', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'George', 'Lazenby', 'Roger', 'Moore', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'actress', 'Eva', 'Green', 'cast', 'Vesper', 'Lynd', 'Bond', 'film', 'veteran', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'only', '007', 'alum', 'return', 'role', 'MI6', 'chief', 'M', 'once', 'again', 'Martin', 'Campbell', 'who', 'directed', 'Brosnan', 'debut', 'GoldenEye', 'director', 'chair', 'twenty-first', 'Bond', 'film.In', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'younger', 'blonder', 'James', 'Bond', 'early', 'MI6', 'career', 'film', 'Bond', 'obtaining', 'first', 'two', 'kills', 'event', 'double-0', 'status', 'gains', 'license', 'kill', 'music', 'score', 'use', 'traditional', '007', 'theme', 'minimum', 'good', 'thing', 'movie', 'film', 'story', 'how', 'Bond', 'Bond.Craig', '007', 'great', 'confidence', 'worthy', 'successor', 'role', 'Dalton', 'brought', 'acting', 'credibility', 'part', 'never', 'seemed', 'fully', 'comfortable', 'role', 'Roger', 'Moore', 'was', 'Ian', 'Fleming', 'original', 'choice', 'prior', 'Connery', 'landing', 'part', 'when', 'Moore', 'did', 'assume', 'role', 'came', 'off', 'more', 'parody', 'regular', 'Bond', 'Brosnan', 'was', 'acceptable', '007', 'physique', 'lack', 'thereof', 'made', 'difficult', 'fans', 'believe', 'was', 'capable', 'engaging', 'fights', 'other', 'physical', 'scenes', 'constantly', 'shown', 'Bond', 'films', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'always', 'been', 'favorite', 'Bond', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'already', 'established', 'very', 'close', 'second.For', 'first', 'time', '1987', 'Living', 'Daylights', 'have', 'Bond', 'film', 'actually', 'based', 'one', 'Ian', 'Fleming', 'books', 'Mads', 'Mikkelsen', 'great', 'villain', 'Le', 'Chiffre', 'banker', 'many', 'world', 'terrorist', 'organizations', 'M', 'put', 'Le', 'Chiffre', 'great', 'financial', 'pressure', 'forcing', 'turn', 'MI6', 'amnesty', 'Montenegro', 'where', 'high', 'stakes', 'poker', 'tournament', 'seeking', 'recoup', 'recent', 'losses', 'cover', 'investments', 'clients', 'Bond', 'tournament', 'mission', 'clean', 'out', 'Le', 'Chiffre', '007', 'having', 'been', 'set', 'up', '10', 'million', 'stake', 'British', 'government', 'Vesper', 'Lynd', 'British', 'treasury', 'agent', 'assigned', 'watch', 'Bond', 'government', 'money.Many', 'elements', 'past', 'Bond', 'films', 'are', 'missing', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'Q', 'Miss', 'Moneypenny', 'many', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'one-liners', 'are', 'now', 'gone', 'as', 'well', 'movie', 'back', 'beginning', 'Bond', 'see', 'reckless', '007', 'who', 'not', 'yet', 'become', 'confident', 'skills', 'abilities', 'over-the-top', 'action', 'sequences', 'many', 'previous', 'Bond', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'replaced', 'much', 'darker', 'tone', 'tragic', 'relationship', 'Bond', 'Vesper', 'insight', 'why', 'traditionally', 'not', 'allow', 'women', 'get', 'close', 'him.This', 'two-disc', 'DVD', 'set', 'several', 'bonus', 'features', 'note', 'including', 'two', 'original', 'featurettes', 'Becoming', 'Bond', 'how', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'became', 'sixth', 'Bond', 'James', 'Bond', 'Real', 'inside', 'look', 'movie', 'action', 'sequences', 'stunts', 'Also', 'included', 'updated', 'version', 'Bond', 'Girls', 'are', 'Forever', 'hosted', 'Maryam', ""d'Abo"", 'Kara', 'Milovny', 'Living', 'Daylights', 'obligatory', 'music', 'video', 'Chris', 'Cornell', 'theme', 'song', 'Know', 'Name', 'such', 'superb', 'work', 'cast', 'crew', 'movie', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'have', 'breathed', 'new', 'life', 'James', 'Bond', 'franchise', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'best', '007', 'movie', '1965', 'Thunderball', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'done', 'excellent', 'job', 'first', 'outing', 'Bond', 'outshining', 'four', 'five', 'predecessors', 'Provided', 'writing', 'direction', 'continue', 'be', 'good', 'look', 'forward', 'watching', 'Craig', 'future', '007', 'films', 'next', 'few', 'years']",N/A

In fact, the main conflict in Casino Royale is a poker game in which Bond must take down terrorist funder Le Chiffre, aided by Vesper Lynd (Eva Green).Daniel Craig plays a reflective and somber Bond, a man who trusts no one. Not to say that Craig's Bond doesn't have a taste for excitement. The action sequences and witty remarks are still there, but simply aren't as bombastic as the old days.

He is far less assured and cool than Connery, engaging in really gritty fights in which he occasionally gets hurt.  There is also more on his background:  an orphan, gone to Oxbridge and wanting to fit into the elegance and style, which explains both his intensity to conform, his uniquely relentless aggression, and his pursuit of cool.  He is also more vulnerable than Connery, esp. to the love of the unbelievably lovely Eva Green.  The villains are also subtle, if sociopathically cold, and their game is not completely explained, which leaves the viewer hoping that the concept of Spectre will evolve in subsequent films from its simple bad guy/terrorist/extortion caricature.Best of all, Craig is so good that you can believe him, just as you could with Connery.

1048670,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000MNP2K8,Robert Moore,"[7, 10]","Vengeance is sweet.  Possibly no actor has received a more impassioned and negative response after being named the new James Bond than Daniel Craig.  He had few strong supporters in the general populace and most were pushing for a variety of other actors from Clive Owen (who would indeed have been quite good) to the recently deposed Pierce Brosnan.  Websites were set up to protest the choice of Craig.  Petitions were circulated denouncing his selection and demanding an alternative.  For once, in a huge way, the general public was proved wrong.  The producers really did know what they were doing and the selection of Daniel Craig as James Bond is certainly the most brilliant decision that they have made since the 007 first made his appearance onscreen nearly fifty years ago.Not just in the selection of Craig, but in a host of minor decisions, this Bond film signals not merely a return to form but a thorough going revamping.  It begins predictably enough, with a dramatic chase scene.  But this stands out as one of the finest openings of any film in the series, with Bond in chase of a bomber who possesses the acrobatic skills of Jackie Chan in his prime.  But some of the changes can be seen in the opening credits.  Instead of nubile women prancing around in profile, we see Bond himself with a design based upon the four card suits.  In fact, the film as a whole is considerably less sexist than most Bond films, though it can hardly be hailed a feminist classic.In a way, this film present almost an alternative reality Bond.  To make it work we all have to pretend that we've never heard of Bond, that he wasn't a creation of the Cold War, that we can imagine that in 2006 we are seeing Bond at the outset of his career.  In this alternative world we get almost instantly views of Bond that we had never seen before.  For one thing, this is not a psychologically normal human being.  Although Timothy Dalton had given us a self-conflicted Bond and in that sense more psychologically complex, Craig's Bond is a borderline sociopath, completely untroubled by the death of a woman he had near made love to the previous evening.  He also is the least quipping of the Bonds, the least apt to see humor in situations and provide a key funny line.  Facially he is not a terribly handsome man, with crude features.  He truly does seem--both mentally and physically--a bit of a brute.  Dressing him up in a tux truly is like putting dress clothing on a Neanderthal, albeit one with a high I.Q. and even quicker wits.  All in all, it is an amazing recreation.  All the previous Bonds had been essentially men of elegance who had learned violence; Craig's Bond is a thug who cleans up well.  And of all the Bonds, including Sean Connery, Craig is the one who most exudes menace and danger.The film as a whole is the least silly Bond film in quite some time.  The focus is away from elaborate gimmicks and massive props that take up an entire set and back to individuals fighting individuals.  The film recalls FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE and GOLDFINGER more than any Bond films since.  And unlike most of the Bond films since those two, it features a story that truly is of interest.  There are twists that truly are twists and intrigue that is genuinely surprising.And for the first time that I can remember, I am actually looking forward to the next Bond film.  I know that there have been those who still cared about Bond, but I long ago ceased to be among them.  I would certainly watch each one as it came out, but now I am actually expectant.  On every level this is easily among the best Bond films ever.  Some even call this the best Bond movie ever and I would not argue very hard against them.  I personally would rate it slightly behind FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE and GOLDFINGER, but certainly no lower than that.I would like to do a call out for one performer in a small role:  Christina Cole.  Many will know her from starring in the British supernatural series HEX.  She is one of the most natural beauties in the movies today and I heartily hope she gets bigger and better roles in the near future.  She appears here in a small role as the desk receptionist in the hotel in the Bahamas.  She should be starring in movies, not playing small bit roles.",5,"Easily the best Bond film in over forty years - no doubt about it, Bond is back",1171756800,"02 18, 2007",2007,4261,"['Vengeance', 'sweet', 'Possibly', 'actor', 'received', 'more', 'impassioned', 'negative', 'response', 'being', 'named', 'new', 'James', 'Bond', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'had', 'few', 'strong', 'supporters', 'general', 'populace', 'most', 'were', 'pushing', 'variety', 'other', 'actors', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'who', 'would', 'indeed', 'have', 'been', 'quite', 'good', 'recently', 'deposed', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'Websites', 'were', 'set', 'up', 'protest', 'choice', 'Craig', 'Petitions', 'were', 'circulated', 'denouncing', 'selection', 'demanding', 'alternative', 'once', 'huge', 'way', 'general', 'public', 'was', 'proved', 'wrong', 'producers', 'really', 'did', 'know', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'selection', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'James', 'Bond', 'certainly', 'most', 'brilliant', 'decision', 'have', 'made', '007', 'first', 'made', 'appearance', 'onscreen', 'nearly', 'fifty', 'years', 'ago.Not', 'just', 'selection', 'Craig', 'host', 'minor', 'decisions', 'Bond', 'film', 'signals', 'not', 'merely', 'return', 'form', 'thorough', 'going', 'revamping', 'predictably', 'enough', 'dramatic', 'chase', 'scene', 'out', 'one', 'finest', 'openings', 'film', 'series', 'Bond', 'chase', 'bomber', 'who', 'acrobatic', 'skills', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'prime', 'changes', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'opening', 'credits', 'Instead', 'nubile', 'women', 'prancing', 'around', 'profile', 'see', 'design', 'based', 'four', 'card', 'suits', 'fact', 'film', 'whole', 'considerably', 'less', 'sexist', 'most', 'Bond', 'films', 'can', 'hardly', 'be', 'hailed', 'feminist', 'classic.In', 'way', 'film', 'present', 'almost', 'alternative', 'reality', 'Bond', 'make', 'work', 'have', 'pretend', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'Bond', 'was', ""n't"", 'creation', 'Cold', 'War', 'can', 'imagine', '2006', 'are', 'seeing', 'Bond', 'outset', 'career', 'alternative', 'world', 'get', 'almost', 'instantly', 'views', 'Bond', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'before', 'one', 'thing', 'not', 'psychologically', 'normal', 'human', 'being', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'had', 'given', 'self-conflicted', 'Bond', 'sense', 'more', 'psychologically', 'complex', 'Craig', 'Bond', 'borderline', 'sociopath', 'completely', 'untroubled', 'death', 'woman', 'had', 'made', 'love', 'previous', 'evening', 'also', 'least', 'quipping', 'Bonds', 'least', 'apt', 'see', 'humor', 'situations', 'provide', 'key', 'funny', 'line', 'Facially', 'not', 'terribly', 'handsome', 'man', 'crude', 'features', 'truly', 'seem', 'mentally', 'physically', 'bit', 'brute', 'Dressing', 'up', 'tux', 'truly', 'putting', 'dress', 'clothing', 'Neanderthal', 'one', 'high', 'I.Q', 'even', 'quicker', 'wits', 'amazing', 'recreation', 'previous', 'Bonds', 'had', 'been', 'essentially', 'men', 'elegance', 'who', 'had', 'learned', 'violence', 'Craig', 'Bond', 'thug', 'who', 'up', 'well', 'Bonds', 'including', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'Craig', 'one', 'who', 'most', 'exudes', 'menace', 'danger.The', 'film', 'whole', 'least', 'silly', 'Bond', 'film', 'quite', 'time', 'focus', 'away', 'elaborate', 'gimmicks', 'massive', 'props', 'take', 'up', 'entire', 'set', 'back', 'individuals', 'fighting', 'individuals', 'film', 'FROM', 'RUSSIA', 'WITH', 'LOVE', 'GOLDFINGER', 'more', 'Bond', 'films', 'most', 'Bond', 'films', 'two', 'story', 'truly', 'interest', 'are', 'twists', 'truly', 'are', 'twists', 'intrigue', 'genuinely', 'surprising.And', 'first', 'time', 'can', 'remember', 'am', 'actually', 'looking', 'forward', 'next', 'Bond', 'film', 'know', 'have', 'been', 'who', 'still', 'cared', 'Bond', 'long', 'ago', 'ceased', 'be', 'would', 'certainly', 'watch', 'one', 'came', 'out', 'now', 'am', 'actually', 'expectant', 'level', 'easily', 'best', 'Bond', 'films', 'ever', 'even', 'call', 'best', 'Bond', 'movie', 'ever', 'would', 'not', 'argue', 'very', 'hard', 'personally', 'would', 'rate', 'slightly', 'FROM', 'RUSSIA', 'WITH', 'LOVE', 'GOLDFINGER', 'certainly', 'lower', 'that.I', 'would', 'like', 'do', 'call', 'out', 'one', 'performer', 'small', 'role', 'Christina', 'Cole', 'Many', 'will', 'know', 'starring', 'British', 'supernatural', 'series', 'HEX', 'one', 'most', 'natural', 'beauties', 'movies', 'today', 'heartily', 'hope', 'bigger', 'better', 'roles', 'near', 'future', 'here', 'small', 'role', 'desk', 'receptionist', 'hotel', 'Bahamas', 'should', 'be', 'starring', 'movies', 'not', 'playing', 'small', 'bit', 'roles']",N/A

CASINO ROYALE finally allows us to glimpse into the dark soul of MI6's Agent 007 and in the process gives us the best Bond movie yet and the greatest screen incarnation of the iconic secret agent as played by Daniel Craig in what will become, as it did for every actor who has come before him, his signature role. CASINO ROYALE reboots the Bond series and updates it to post-9/11 modern times simultaneously. The result is a mature and gripping spy adventure that in its more quiter moments often invites comparison to the works of John Le Carre and Graham Greene with the same emphasis on interesting characters and their motivations. But that's not to say CASINO ROYALE skimps on the fireworks. There's plenty of great action sequences including two that might make your jaw drop: the opening action beat finds Bond chasing a scarred bombmaker on foot through Madagascar including an extended confrontation atop a high-steel construction site and makes wonderous use of the French free-running sport of Parkour; and a car chase where Bond's tricked-out spymobile does a few pretty frightening flips. The most suspenseful moments are the poker table duels between Bond and his blood-weeping adversary Le Chiffre (played by the great Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen with a subdued madness). Who would have ever thought Texas Hold 'Em could be so edge-of-the-seat thrilling? As 007's ice-cool boss M Dame Judi Dench is the only returning cast member from the previous Pierce Brosnan Bond flicks but she's given a real character to play this time around and her relationship with Craig's Bond carries genuine weight. Eve Green does some of her best acting to date as Vesper Lynd, the one woman capable of capturing Bond's elusive heart. Captain Kirk had Carol Marcus, Bond has Vesper. Jeffrey Wright and Giancarlo Gianni provide stand-out performances as two of Bond's unlikely colleagues.

Zwick,"[3, 4]","****1/2The long-running James Bond franchise gets a much-needed  shot in the arm with ""Casino Royale,"" a film which gives us, in the person of Daniel Craig, the least foppish, most rough-and-tumble 007 since the early days of Sean Connery.  Here's a Bond who's more at home in jeans and a polo shirt than in a perfectly tailored Giorgio Armani tuxedo (though he isn`t above wearing one, if the situation calls for it).  Gone, too, are many of the high-tech gadgets and preposterous, over-the-top villains that had begun to push the series increasingly into the realm of fantasy and camp and further away from reality.As conceived by writers Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and the seemingly ubiquitous Paul Haggis, Craig's Bond also has a noticeably darker side to his personality.  The authors have gone back to the source here, to Ian Fleming's first novel in the series, ""Casino Royale.""  This has allowed the writers to re-invent Bond almost from scratch as it were, and, indeed, the first scene of the movie - filmed in appropriately old-school black-and-white - shows us Bond literally gunning for his promotion to double O status (an agent can become an 00 only after he's successfully dispatched two victims).  Yet, despite this Bond's seeming indifference to human life, Craig brings a vulnerability and depth of character to the role that nicely counterbalance the dry cynicism, flippant tone and callous womanizing that are still crucial elements of the character`s mystique and makeup.  Yet, even in that latter category, this new Bond deviates from the old one by striking up a genuinely romantic relationship with the beautiful Vesper Lynd, nicely portrayed by Eva Green.The main plot - in which Bond finds himself on the Riviera playing in a high-stakes poker game against a notorious small-arms dealer - is secondary to the tense action scenes, wry humor and moral dilemmas that make ""Casino Royale"" a triumph for director Martin Campbell as well.After years of delivering one fine performance after another in a string of less high-profile but often very worthy films, it's gratifying to see Craig finally achieving the acclaim and stardom he so richly deserves with ""Casino Royale.""  With the help of his fellow filmmakers, he has nearly single-handedly resurrected this moribund franchise and reminded us of just how good a Bond picture can actually be.",4,Re-inventing Bond,1181779200,"06 14, 2007",2007,2365,"['****1/2The', 'long-running', 'James', 'Bond', 'franchise', 'much-needed', 'shot', 'arm', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'film', 'person', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'least', 'foppish', 'most', 'rough-and-tumble', '007', 'early', 'days', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'Here', 'Bond', 'who', 'more', 'home', 'jeans', 'polo', 'shirt', 'perfectly', 'tailored', 'Giorgio', 'Armani', 'tuxedo', 't', 'wearing', 'one', 'situation', 'Gone', 'too', 'are', 'many', 'high-tech', 'gadgets', 'preposterous', 'over-the-top', 'villains', 'had', 'begun', 'push', 'series', 'increasingly', 'realm', 'fantasy', 'camp', 'further', 'away', 'reality.As', 'conceived', 'writers', 'Neal', 'Purvis', 'Robert', 'Wade', 'seemingly', 'ubiquitous', 'Paul', 'Haggis', 'Craig', 'Bond', 'also', 'noticeably', 'darker', 'side', 'personality', 'authors', 'have', 'gone', 'back', 'source', 'here', 'Ian', 'Fleming', 'first', 'novel', 'series', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'allowed', 'writers', 're-invent', 'Bond', 'almost', 'scratch', 'were', 'indeed', 'first', 'scene', 'movie', 'filmed', 'appropriately', 'old-school', 'black-and-white', 'Bond', 'literally', 'gunning', 'promotion', 'double', 'O', 'status', 'agent', 'can', 'become', '00', 'only', 'successfully', 'dispatched', 'two', 'victims', 'Bond', 'seeming', 'indifference', 'human', 'life', 'Craig', 'vulnerability', 'depth', 'character', 'role', 'nicely', 'counterbalance', 'dry', 'cynicism', 'flippant', 'tone', 'callous', 'womanizing', 'are', 'still', 'crucial', 'elements', 'character', 's', 'mystique', 'makeup', 'even', 'latter', 'category', 'new', 'Bond', 'deviates', 'old', 'one', 'striking', 'up', 'genuinely', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'beautiful', 'Vesper', 'Lynd', 'nicely', 'portrayed', 'Eva', 'Green.The', 'main', 'plot', 'Bond', 'Riviera', 'playing', 'high-stakes', 'poker', 'game', 'notorious', 'small-arms', 'dealer', 'secondary', 'tense', 'action', 'scenes', 'wry', 'humor', 'moral', 'dilemmas', 'make', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'triumph', 'director', 'Martin', 'Campbell', 'well.After', 'years', 'delivering', 'one', 'fine', 'performance', 'string', 'less', 'high-profile', 'often', 'very', 'worthy', 'films', 'gratifying', 'see', 'Craig', 'finally', 'achieving', 'acclaim', 'stardom', 'so', 'richly', 'deserves', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'help', 'fellow', 'filmmakers', 'nearly', 'single-handedly', 'resurrected', 'moribund', 'franchise', 'reminded', 'just', 'how', 'good', 'Bond', 'picture', 'can', 'actually', 'be']",N/A
1048675,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B000MNP2K8,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[1, 2]","It's long and loud, and for much of the latter part of it, it's difficult to see just where ""Casino Royale"" is going, but it's still irresistible.  ""Casino"" has Bond out to stop a cold, calculating and compulsive gambler named Le Chiffre from bank-rolling hundreds of millions for terrorists.  The story occurs just as Bond has first received his ""stripes"" as a ""double-o"" agent for MI6 - a promotion he earns in a gritty pre-credits teaser by taking out a turncoat spy in Prague.  Sent to Madagascar to track a web of bomb-makers and their financiers, Bond instead assassinates the bomb-maker inside of a foreign embassy - an act of war unfortunately caught by closed circuit TV.  (Luckily for us, it also involves a dynamite foot-chase which has to be seen to be believed in and around a construction site.)  While M believes the mission a bust, Bond instead picks up the trail of the bomb-maker to Le Chiffre, figuring that the gambler's fortunes are tied to terrorism.  Hardly a believer in the causes he finances, Le Chiffre uses the millions of warlords to leverage his own schemes.  After Bond foils a spectacular scheme involving an airport and the maiden voyage of an airliner even bigger than the A-380, one that would have made millions for Le Chiffre, the terror-gambler is now stuck to earn his clients' money back.  For the West, it's a golden opportunity to catch Le Chiffre.  Unless he wins a multi-million dollar Poker Match in Montenegro, he'll have to surrender to Western intelligence or face the wrath of his ruthless clientele. (Bond's masters are betting on surrender.)That's about all I can say about ""Casino"" because it is definitely a plot-thin, attitude-thick movie.  Craig plays a Bond who seems new to the role of killing people, but looks to be anticipating the bruised soul that his new job will come with.  He bonds with Vesper Lynd, in ways that previous Bonds haven't pulled off with their women.  This Bond makes do without gadgets or even many funny catchphrases.  He gets bruised and beaten and he doesn't always have the steel resolve to insist on having his Martini shaken.  In other words, it's camp-free Bond - it's humorless but not without its share of wit.

But, I suppose that they want people to see every James Bond film as it's own unique project and not a series of stories that you would think that should play end to end.  Casino Royale is supposed to be the story that started it all.  All us original James Bond fans think of James Bond being about 40-ish back in 1962, so if that were the case, and if all these stories were to play end to end, shouldn't the Pierce Brosnan Bond be someone in his mid-80's?  Where's the appeal in that?  No, I believe every James Bond story is designed to be of the modern day of today.  The only thing that seems to link all the Bond films together is that we know James Bond married once, and she was then murdered.  This crucial part of the James Bond saga was done in a James Bond film by a guy who only did one Bond film, George Lazenby, in On Her Majesty's Secret Service. And in the beginning of For Your Eyes Only, you see James Bond (Roger Moore) in 1981 visiting his wife's grave (and the date of her birth and death is on the tombstone).Yes, having Judi Dench as ""M"" for the first time James Bond becomes licensed to kill does seem a little awkward when other Bond film's exist with her as ""M"".  Then in ""Golden Eye"", we have her describing herself as the new ""M"" meeting the ""already employed"" James Bond (with a long tracklist of past assignments in his file), and ""Q"" already established in the James Bond timeline as well.  But, we're not supposed to link these things together.  We're suppose to enjoy these stories as individual stories and not focus on a timeline.  So, yes it would be difficult to try and watch these stories in a probable fabricated order.  Like watching ""Casino Royale"" first, and then try ""Dr. No"" as the next story.  It doesn't work, does it?  James Bond has a 40 plus year history, however, he never ages, does he?  He's always about 40 to 45 years old.  But, who cares?And to close, in my opinion, I though Pierce Brosnan's ""Die Another Day"" was an excellent James Bond film.  I liked it better than ""Golden Eye"" which was once my first favorite Pierce Brosnan Bond film.  But, like most people, I think Sean Connery will always represent the perfect James Bond.  Perhaps because he was the first.  Roger Moore was a bit stiff and boorish to me compared to Connery.  But, the Roger Moore/James Bond era had some excellent stories for the James Bond saga.What was starting to bother me about some James Bond films, was that they were starting to get well-known established actresses to play the women that become Bond girls.  I like the Bond films better when they use some unknown beauty from other countries to represent the new Bond girl.  That gives the story a more personal charm when it may be the only film you will see of that particular actress.The James Bond saga may go on for another 40 years, and James Bond will never age.

Craig's steel-blue eyes, clenched jaw, and massive shoulders remind us that Bond is first and foremost a killer.  Everything else - the women, the gadgets, the one-liners - are mere window dressing.""CR"" is the first James Bond novel written by Ian Fleming, and so the movie is essentially the prequel for the James Bond series of films.  The opening sequence shows Bond reaching ""double-o"" status.  His relationship with M (Judi Dench) is flinty.  And Bond is also naive about his new status.  After a bravura chase sequence in which Bond goes after a bomb-maker, one of those astounding urban acrobat types, Bond proves that he does not yet see the ""big picture.""  Bond's poor judgment forces M to put him on hiatus, and so Bond heads to the Bahamas.But Bond does not take anything lying down.  He knows that something is afoot with the bomb-maker he nailed in Uganda, and he needs to track down the guy who has hired the bomber.  Some clever detective work and opportunistic womanizing lead Bond to Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen), a banker to the world's terrorists.  Le Chiffre is a bit reckless, however, and has some of his clients angry because he has lost their money.  All this leads to a huge poker game - no baccarat for Craig's Bond - where Bond, Le Chiffre, and the CIA's Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright) go head-to-head.In addition to being one of the most solid, well-crafted Bond movies ever, the delights in ""CR"" are found in how the movie plants the seeds of the James Bond legend.  We see how Bond forges his lifelong friendship with Felix.  We also see the birth of Bond's fondness for the vodka martini.  Perhaps most importantly, we get a little understanding about Bond's complex relationship with women after Vesper (Eva Green), a British banker, gets closer to him than any woman ever has.A beautiful film shot on gorgeous locations, ""CR"" knows that the Bond franchise needed a huge shot of adrenaline.

1048694,A1DUIMS229CQR1,B000MNP2K8,scott welles,"[3, 6]","After forty years, twenty movies and five Bonds, it was reasonable to assume that the series had all the life ground out of it long ago -- how long, exactly, we could debate endlessly.  One thing, however, seemed certain: that Ian Fleming's original literary character had been washed away by a sea of cinematic silliness, giving only his name to a massive juggernaut of cheap thrills.Thank god we were wrong.  At last, at long, LONG last, we finally, finally, FINALLY have the first no-B.S. Bond since ""From Russia With Love"".  That's longer than I've been alive.What makes this version of Casino Royale -- the third one filmed, but the only one really worth watching -- so immensely satisfying is the fact that the writers have done essentially what Jeremy Brett did for Sherlock Holmes twenty years earlier: stripped away all of the extra elements added by the movie studios and returned to the origins of the character.  Gone are the flirtations with Moneypenny, the snippy banter with Q, the stupid gadgets, the white-cat-stroking megalomaniac master villains with their doomsday weapons controlled from underwater volcano fortresses filled with armies of jumpsuited technician, and (praise god for this above all else) the women with porn-star names and ""Oh, James!"" repertoires.  Bye-bye to all that nonsense, as enjoyable as it once was.Not to say that the action is lacking -- in fact, there are some terrific scenes in this movie, neatly combining cliffhanger thrills with down-to-earth locales.  An early chase scene involving dazzling free-running stunts is a particular standout.  But it never goes completely into fantasy land, a la Roger Moore's films.  Similarly, the plot, the villains, the violence, and even the gadgetry are well within the realm of possibility for a change.  Bond has access to the technology one might expect in the intelligence game: tracking devices, satellite uplinks and so on, but no lasers in the wristwatch or sport cars that turn into submarines.Best of all, Daniel Craig is Ian Fleming's Bond in a way that no other actor ever has been -- no, not even the venerable Sean Connery.  I realize it's widely considered somewhat blasphemous to suggest that Sean was anything less than perfect in the role, but I'm saying it here.  To his credit, this is mostly the fault of the writers and producers who quickly sacrificed the Hitchcockian suspense and characterizations of ""From Russia With Love"" for the comic-book goofiness of ""Goldfinger"" and all subsequent entries.  Connery himself has called ""FRWL"" his favorite, and it's easy to see why: it's about the last time he was given the chance to play the character AS a character.  George ""love-him-or-hate-him"" Lazenby touched on it, and the unjustly underrated Timothy Dalton tried valiantly to get back to that level of acting in the series, but he was swimming hopelessly against the tide at the time.  Roger Moore never really bothered, but relied instead on his own brand of screen presence to carry him through, and Pierce Brosnan was too busy keeping his head up in a series of increasingly over-the-top explosions.  But now, with this excellent reboot of the series, Craig has the opportunity to start fresh, applying himself to the reality of Bond, instead of living up to the massive, overwhelming screen-image of what has gone before.Critics of Craig's who claimed he was unfit or inappropriate for the role of James Bond have, I think, largely missed the point of the character.  He may well be the first Bond (except perhaps Connery) who was cast based on his skill as an actor rather than his potential as a matinee idol.  Certainly, he looks less like a pretty-boy movie star and more like a guy who can get the job done than most Bonds, and this is as it should be.  Bond himself, in one of the novels, resisted comparison to a movie star, claiming, ""That's the worst insult you can pay a man.""  Craig's Bond deftly avoids the mistake almost universally made by the previous movies: his James Bond, like Fleming's, is a very sexy figure, not because he's handsome or charming, but because he is cold, hard, and very dangerous.  This is a man who does the British government's dirty work, and wakes up each day knowing he may have to kill someone before he sleeps again.  He's a soldier with a polish-job, a la 'My Fair Lady', to let him wear the tux and pass among the beautiful people, but all the Cary Grant charm and the Hugh Hefner lifestyle aren't who he is inside; his true passion is the work, not the women.  Craig's Bond, like Fleming's, is a man who doesn't enjoy the killing, but takes pride in doing it well.And, at the end of the day, he is still: ""Bond.  James Bond.""",5,"At last, it's truly ""Ian Fleming's"" James Bond 007!",1176681600,"04 16, 2007",2007,4691,"['forty', 'years', 'twenty', 'movies', 'five', 'Bonds', 'was', 'reasonable', 'assume', 'series', 'had', 'life', 'ground', 'long', 'ago', 'how', 'long', 'exactly', 'could', 'debate', 'endlessly', 'One', 'thing', 'however', 'seemed', 'certain', 'Ian', 'Fleming', 'original', 'literary', 'character', 'had', 'been', 'washed', 'away', 'sea', 'cinematic', 'silliness', 'giving', 'only', 'name', 'massive', 'juggernaut', 'cheap', 'thrills.Thank', 'god', 'were', 'wrong', 'last', 'long', 'LONG', 'last', 'finally', 'finally', 'FINALLY', 'have', 'first', 'no-B.S', 'Bond', 'Russia', 'Love', 'longer', ""'ve"", 'been', 'alive.What', 'version', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'third', 'one', 'filmed', 'only', 'one', 'really', 'worth', 'watching', 'so', 'immensely', 'satisfying', 'fact', 'writers', 'have', 'done', 'essentially', 'what', 'Jeremy', 'Brett', 'did', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'twenty', 'years', 'earlier', 'stripped', 'away', 'extra', 'elements', 'added', 'movie', 'studios', 'returned', 'origins', 'character', 'Gone', 'are', 'flirtations', 'Moneypenny', 'snippy', 'banter', 'Q', 'stupid', 'gadgets', 'white-cat-stroking', 'megalomaniac', 'master', 'villains', 'doomsday', 'weapons', 'controlled', 'underwater', 'volcano', 'fortresses', 'filled', 'armies', 'jumpsuited', 'technician', 'praise', 'god', 'else', 'women', 'porn-star', 'names', 'Oh', 'James', 'Bye-bye', 'all', 'nonsense', 'as', 'enjoyable', 'once', 'was.Not', 'say', 'action', 'lacking', 'fact', 'are', 'terrific', 'scenes', 'movie', 'neatly', 'combining', 'cliffhanger', 'thrills', 'down-to-earth', 'locales', 'early', 'chase', 'scene', 'involving', 'dazzling', 'free-running', 'stunts', 'particular', 'standout', 'never', 'completely', 'fantasy', 'land', 'la', 'Roger', 'Moore', 'films', 'Similarly', 'plot', 'villains', 'violence', 'even', 'gadgetry', 'are', 'well', 'realm', 'possibility', 'change', 'Bond', 'access', 'technology', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'intelligence', 'game', 'tracking', 'devices', 'satellite', 'uplinks', 'so', 'lasers', 'wristwatch', 'sport', 'cars', 'turn', 'submarines.Best', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'Ian', 'Fleming', 'Bond', 'way', 'other', 'actor', 'ever', 'been', 'not', 'even', 'venerable', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'realize', 'widely', 'considered', 'somewhat', 'blasphemous', 'suggest', 'Sean', 'was', 'anything', 'less', 'perfect', 'role', ""'m"", 'saying', 'here', 'credit', 'mostly', 'fault', 'writers', 'producers', 'who', 'quickly', 'sacrificed', 'Hitchcockian', 'suspense', 'characterizations', 'Russia', 'Love', 'comic-book', 'goofiness', 'Goldfinger', 'subsequent', 'entries', 'Connery', 'called', 'FRWL', 'favorite', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'last', 'time', 'was', 'given', 'chance', 'play', 'character', 'character', 'George', 'love-him-or-hate-him', 'Lazenby', 'touched', 'unjustly', 'underrated', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'tried', 'valiantly', 'get', 'back', 'level', 'acting', 'series', 'was', 'swimming', 'hopelessly', 'tide', 'time', 'Roger', 'Moore', 'never', 'really', 'bothered', 'relied', 'instead', 'own', 'brand', 'screen', 'presence', 'carry', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'was', 'too', 'busy', 'keeping', 'head', 'up', 'series', 'increasingly', 'over-the-top', 'explosions', 'now', 'excellent', 'reboot', 'series', 'Craig', 'opportunity', 'start', 'fresh', 'applying', 'reality', 'Bond', 'instead', 'living', 'up', 'massive', 'overwhelming', 'screen-image', 'what', 'gone', 'before.Critics', 'Craig', 'who', 'claimed', 'was', 'unfit', 'inappropriate', 'role', 'James', 'Bond', 'have', 'think', 'largely', 'missed', 'point', 'character', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'first', 'Bond', 'perhaps', 'Connery', 'who', 'was', 'cast', 'based', 'skill', 'actor', 'rather', 'potential', 'matinee', 'idol', 'Certainly', 'less', 'pretty-boy', 'movie', 'star', 'more', 'guy', 'who', 'can', 'get', 'job', 'done', 'most', 'Bonds', 'should', 'be', 'Bond', 'one', 'novels', 'resisted', 'comparison', 'movie', 'star', 'claiming', 'worst', 'insult', 'can', 'pay', 'man', 'Craig', 'Bond', 'deftly', 'mistake', 'almost', 'universally', 'made', 'previous', 'movies', 'James', 'Bond', 'Fleming', 'very', 'sexy', 'figure', 'not', 'handsome', 'charming', 'cold', 'hard', 'very', 'dangerous', 'man', 'who', 'British', 'government', 'dirty', 'work', 'up', 'day', 'knowing', 'may', 'have', 'kill', 'someone', 'again', 'soldier', 'polish-job', 'la', 'Fair', 'Lady', 'let', 'wear', 'tux', 'pass', 'beautiful', 'people', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'charm', 'Hugh', 'Hefner', 'lifestyle', 'are', ""n't"", 'who', 'inside', 'true', 'passion', 'work', 'not', 'women', 'Craig', 'Bond', 'Fleming', 'man', 'who', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'killing', 'pride', 'doing', 'well.And', 'end', 'day', 'still', 'Bond', 'James', 'Bond']",N/A

To name a few:1.  It is supposed to be Bond before/as he gets his 00 status.  Yet, Judi Dench is M.  Now, I think she is tremendous as M, but it doesn't fit the chronology.  I suspect she was used to pull in the fans as a familiar face in the franchise and while I understand the logic and love seeing her act whenever possible, it was not the best solution for this film.2.  The use of current technologies bugged me the whole time.  Like, how did Vesper Lynd get a Blackberry??  Cell phones everywhere??  No really cool gadgets, but technology that didn't belong.3.  WHERE IS Q??????????  Now sadly I am very well aware that Desmond Llewellyn couldn't play the role but the interaction between Bond and Q is a classic part of Bond lore that is sorely missing in this film.  They should have cast someone as the precursor to the Q we have known and loved through countless 007 films.I have every James Bond film and I fell asleep the first 4 times I watched this film.  I still don't really remember the end without having to really think about it.  The action was more like an Urban war movie, the gadgets - well, wrong.  I found the passion between Bond and Lynd unconvincing and just really didn't care one way or the other how it all came out I'm sorry to say.  As unpopular as it may be to say, I think the lions share of the blame lies with the script. I know from the special features that Cubby wanted to transform this book into film for decades but this implementation just didn't make it for me. I so very much hope that the next one recaptures the magic of James Bond.  Not just the unusual locales, the gadgets, Q and M, but the chemistry, witty dialog and sardonic humor that infects the most enjoyable of the franchise productions.

Although it is hard to compare--this was made in a different time from the old ones.  The old ones were more friendly and had more of a warm, everything is okay feeling of fun.  But Casino Royale was gritty all the way through, and seriously dramatic and sad in the end.  There was never any real drama in any of the others.  If you pay attention, and watch it a couple times, at the end you can pick up the message the director and writers probably worked really hard to communicate: the movie showed how James Bond became what he was.  This movie covered the beginning of his career as a spy.  You notice at the beginning, the scene about him killing the first person whose life he'd ever taken--the guy he murdered in the men's room.  That means it was the beginning.After what happened in the movie at the end you then see how he would not care about any of the women he was with after Vespar and would be able to kill people indiscriminately.  I don't want to spoil it if someone hasn't seen it, but his heart was dead after what happened and he went from then on as a very hard man, like untouchable, using women and killing people.

1048699,A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ,B000MNP2K8,Sean Pasek,"[3, 4]","Characters who have been around for a long time, basically crossing generational gaps, usually come to a point when they need a facelift to maintain their appeal for later generations.  Superman got one in the series, Smallville.  Batman got one in Batman Begins.  James Bond, which has been around for nearly fifty years on screen, was also badly in need of some reinvention.  After the Mission Impossible films and the Bourne films, it was clear that audiences are into much more serious characters than the tongue-in-cheek Bond.  In the last few Bond films, the wit was getting old, and people began to tire of the ridiculous, unrealistic stunts that Bond would pull off.  Jumping off a cliff on a motorcycle to climb into an airplane?!?Casino Royale puts Bond in a much more realistic light.  While he might have a couple of witty lines, he's very serious character who takes his job very seriously.  And while he might pull off some brilliant maneuvers, he's not performing stunts that are clearly outside the realm of possibility.  The audiences quickly responded to this new James Bond.  Sean Connery, Roger Moore, and Pierce Bronsan have each already christened Daniel Craig as THE new James Bond with high praise.Casino Royale takes us back to the very beginning of James Bond, before he's given his 007 status.  We get to see who Bond starts out and what events shape the man he will eventually become.  For example, you will be given a glimpse as to Bond's treatment of women.Bond is given his first assignment as a ""00"" agent.  He has to find a way to stop a man, LeChiffe, from funding terrorism by taking his money in a poker game.  Anyone who's watched the World Series of Poker will find the poker scenes to be crisp and suspenseful.  Bond is pegged as the best card player in the agency (no surprise there!), which is one of the reasons why he's chosen for this assignment.One good thing about this new Bond, is that he is not infallible; he makes mistakes, even being as good as he is, there are those who are even better.  The fun is watching how Bond finds ways to outsmart his opponents.  Gone are the times when things just happen to fall into place for Bond.  One mistake nearly costs him his life.Daniel Craig is a terrific James Bond.  Some people have already pegged him as their favorite Bond.  I still think it's hard to beat Sean Connery, but Daniel Craig comes awfully close.  Craig succeeds in making Bond his own character.  He isn't trying to mimick Connery, Brosnan, or anyone else.  His Bond is very serious, and many of the Bondisms are now gone.  For example during a scene at the bar, Bond asks for a martini.  The bartender asks, ""Would you like that shaken or stirred?""  Bond growls back, ""Do I look like I give a damn?""  I felt that Craig solidified his place as James Bond with this scene.  He told audiences then and there that he is not the James Bond that you're used to.  He's different Bond, and he should be.This movie is full of twists, suspense, and action.  Nothing is what it seems to be, and neither are the characters.  The movie will keep you on the edge of your seat, and right off the bat too with one of the greatest chase sequences to be filmed in recent years.  But best of all, Bond is now grounded in reality, and this reinvention helps to demonstrate why, for many people, James Bond is the quintessential hero.",5,Re-Invention Gives Bond a Much Needed Facelift,1196553600,"12 2, 2007",2007,3374,"['Characters', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'long', 'time', 'basically', 'crossing', 'generational', 'gaps', 'usually', 'come', 'point', 'when', 'need', 'facelift', 'maintain', 'appeal', 'later', 'generations', 'Superman', 'got', 'one', 'series', 'Smallville', 'Batman', 'got', 'one', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'James', 'Bond', 'been', 'nearly', 'fifty', 'years', 'screen', 'was', 'also', 'badly', 'need', 'reinvention', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'films', 'Bourne', 'films', 'was', 'clear', 'audiences', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'serious', 'characters', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'Bond', 'last', 'few', 'Bond', 'films', 'wit', 'was', 'getting', 'old', 'people', 'began', 'tire', 'ridiculous', 'unrealistic', 'stunts', 'Bond', 'would', 'pull', 'off', 'Jumping', 'off', 'cliff', 'motorcycle', 'climb', 'airplane', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'Bond', 'much', 'more', 'realistic', 'light', 'might', 'have', 'couple', 'witty', 'lines', 'very', 'serious', 'character', 'who', 'job', 'very', 'seriously', 'might', 'pull', 'off', 'brilliant', 'maneuvers', 'not', 'performing', 'stunts', 'are', 'clearly', 'realm', 'possibility', 'audiences', 'quickly', 'responded', 'new', 'James', 'Bond', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'Roger', 'Moore', 'Pierce', 'Bronsan', 'have', 'already', 'christened', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'THE', 'new', 'James', 'Bond', 'high', 'praise.Casino', 'Royale', 'back', 'very', 'beginning', 'James', 'Bond', 'given', '007', 'status', 'get', 'see', 'who', 'Bond', 'out', 'what', 'events', 'shape', 'man', 'will', 'eventually', 'become', 'example', 'will', 'be', 'given', 'glimpse', 'Bond', 'treatment', 'women.Bond', 'given', 'first', 'assignment', '00', 'agent', 'find', 'way', 'stop', 'man', 'LeChiffe', 'funding', 'terrorism', 'taking', 'money', 'poker', 'game', 'Anyone', 'who', 'watched', 'World', 'Series', 'Poker', 'will', 'find', 'poker', 'scenes', 'be', 'crisp', 'suspenseful', 'Bond', 'pegged', 'best', 'card', 'player', 'agency', 'surprise', 'there', 'one', 'reasons', 'why', 'chosen', 'assignment.One', 'good', 'thing', 'new', 'Bond', 'not', 'infallible', 'mistakes', 'even', 'being', 'as', 'good', 'are', 'who', 'are', 'even', 'better', 'fun', 'watching', 'how', 'Bond', 'ways', 'outsmart', 'opponents', 'Gone', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'things', 'just', 'happen', 'fall', 'place', 'Bond', 'One', 'mistake', 'nearly', 'life.Daniel', 'Craig', 'terrific', 'James', 'Bond', 'people', 'have', 'already', 'pegged', 'favorite', 'Bond', 'still', 'think', 'hard', 'beat', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'awfully', 'close', 'Craig', 'making', 'Bond', 'own', 'character', ""n't"", 'trying', 'mimick', 'Connery', 'Brosnan', 'anyone', 'else', 'Bond', 'very', 'serious', 'many', 'Bondisms', 'are', 'now', 'gone', 'example', 'scene', 'bar', 'Bond', 'martini', 'bartender', 'Would', 'shaken', 'stirred', 'Bond', 'back', 'Do', 'look', 'give', 'damn', 'felt', 'Craig', 'solidified', 'place', 'James', 'Bond', 'scene', 'told', 'audiences', 'then', 'there', 'not', 'James', 'Bond', ""'re"", 'used', 'different', 'Bond', 'should', 'be.This', 'movie', 'full', 'twists', 'suspense', 'action', 'Nothing', 'what', 'be', 'are', 'characters', 'movie', 'will', 'keep', 'edge', 'seat', 'right', 'bat', 'too', 'one', 'greatest', 'chase', 'sequences', 'be', 'filmed', 'recent', 'years', 'best', 'Bond', 'now', 'grounded', 'reality', 'reinvention', 'demonstrate', 'why', 'many', 'people', 'James', 'Bond', 'quintessential', 'hero']",N/A

This is exactly what Martin Cambell did in Daniel's Craig first movie as the beloved 007. We find a Bond at the start of his career, having recently attained the 00 status, and showing a personality that differs from what we are used to seeing from this character. I am not going to lie to you, Sean Connery still is, and probably will always be, my favorite Bond, but Craig comes pretty close to the Master. And he is undoubtedly better than the last couple of actors that attempted the feat of portraying one of the most charismatic secret agents ever.This time around, the plot takes us from Madagascar to the Bahamas. In the process we find bankers stealing money from Freedom Fighters, bomb-makers with clear and important targets in mind, a fair amount of poker playing, and of course, attractive women. The most interesting aspect of the movie is the differences in Bond's personality compared to the other movies. Here we can see how his attitude towards women changed and the reasons behind this. Also, there are many details that if you have watched the previous Bond productions you will not see in this one. Even though one of these shows up towards the end, you will miss several Bond traits that are always present. It is fun to go through the movie spotting these absences.The action scenes are exciting and even though they are unrealistic, as is usually the case with Bond movies, this aspect was toned down from the latest efforts. The high speed chase on foot in Madagascar is remarkable and very well filmed, and even though it runs for a fair amount of time, we do not get bored in the least. As I already mentioned, there is also quite a bit of poker playing. This is only natural, seeing the popularity this game has gained lately.

I was a little disappointed because I was expecting it to be a great movie reading all the positive reviews. Some action scenes were exaggerated  and contrived, especially the chase scene early in the movie. I don't want to give too many details if you have not seen it but that scene from start-to-finish was filled with excessive and unrealistic action sequences and ends up in way that contradicts Bond's character.As the plot thickens, the movie gets more interesting.

I loved this film. Signalling a real fresh start for the series, this film is far more serious and darker in tone than the cartoonish Die Another Day, and reminiscent of Christopher Nolan's ""Batman Begins"" in the sense of being a welcome reboot for the franchise.Daniel Craig is fantastic, he is not just a good Bond, he IS Bond, closer in tone to Timothy Dalton or Sean Connery, than Pierce Brosnan (with the exception of Die Another Day I really enjoyed Brosnan's films though) or Roger Moore, and has little in the way of quips. He is coldhearted, less suave and quite egocentric and rude, as he's learning the ropes of being an agent at this point before he is given his Licence to Kill by his boss ""M"" (Judi Dench), he's like a prototype Sean Connery.Some great action, an early fight on top of a crane reminded me of the climatic fight of 1995's excellent ""Goldeneye"" - perhaps the best Pierce Brosnan outing, no coincidence that film was also directed by Martin Campbell.I think the film is a wee bit long (145 minutes is quite long for an action film), and couldn't believe it was a UK 12A (cinema rating) as some stuff was definitely not for kids and quite brutal.I loved the humour in the film, there were some very funny moments that had me laughing out loud in places. I loved the part when the barman asks Bond if he takes his drink shaken or stirred, Craig growls ""Does it look like I give a damn!"" sending up a clich&eacute; of the series, or the part when he drove in a circle to get back to his ""home""! What was especially good was how the film could be amsuing without resorting to the groanworthy puns of earlier films.I liked how the character of Bond could be vulnerable though and feel pain (something hinted at in Die Another Day).

It's based off the Ian Fleming novel and essentially reboots the franchise with 007's first major case, to bring down the terrorist banker Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen).Similar to what Batman Begins did for its franchise in 2005, Casino Royale takes a formulaic pop culture icon and makes him relevant and exciting again by bringing back the basics. I'm a huge Bond fan and I would've been happy with more Bond films in the vein of the Brosnan era, but this installment is like the breath of fresh air I didn't know I needed. Suddenly we have a James Bond that gets to develop as a real character, a beautiful love interest that really matters (Eva Green will go down among the best of the Bond girls), and action sequences that are intense and edgy without looking like they've been coated in the usual Hollywood gloss. This may be the 21st film in the franchise, but it stands on its own as a great movie and that's what makes Casino Royale work.The original 2-disc release was barren of any really relevant features, so while I usually avoid the double-dips, this was one Collector's Edition that was worth it. You get everything that was in the 2-disc set, plus a third disc loaded with deleted scenes and documentaries.

The pre-credits sequence is very good, and its a shame they didn't maintain some of that style in the main film. This is Bonds last mission before he gets his double O status.Daniel Craig does bring something new to Bond. He is mean and ruthless, but underneath there is still a heart in there. The plot is simple, leading to a very high-stakes poker game at the Casino Royale, which was one of the best scenes in the film for me - quite mesmerising. Mads Mikkelsen as Le Chiffre made a worthy opponent to Craigs Bond, both at the Poker table and as a torturer. This latter sequence is extremly unpleasant and certainly not for youngsters. Judi Dench played M again and although it was only a small part she was, as always very good.The film isn't perfect though, their are a few sequences (such as at the airport and the sinking house at the end) which are typical Hollywood blockbuster stuff and unneccessary.

For whatever reason, the 1967 version had multiple directors (Ken Hughes and John Huston) and they took Fleming's first Bond novel and turned it into a star-studded, comedian actor filled spy movie satire. In a confusing mess there is even more than one actor playing Bond (Peter Sellers and David Niven).Anyway, in 2006 along comes Martin Campbell (who also did GoldenEye in 1995) to direct and bring integrity back to the film adaptation of Casino Royale. Adding to the 2006 version's strength is a bold new 21st Century Bond.Big and small screen vet Daniel Craig takes over as 007, and he's terrific.Set in the present, Casino Royale shows you a brief look at how Bond attains ""00"" (two kills) status, first in a black and white (perhaps a salute Bond's true birthday in 1953) short scene, and then in a surreal pursuit that includes the human ability to fly...well almost...you know, like in those new Kung Fu movies?After these brief opening scenes I was a bit skeptic that the rest of the movie would follow suit in the unbelievable. But I was pleasantly surprised. Sure, there is no lack of the sensational, death defying feats that Bond commits throughout. But it was all done with...what was the word I used earlier?...Ah yes: Integrity.Hopefully there will be some more Bond movies with Craig (at least one is planned for 2008). And as long as the writers and directors can hold together what Campbell has certainly revitalized, the Bond franchise could be something to look forward to for years to come.Casino Royale was great.

This is a guy whose instincts just barely manage to keep him ahead of his own recklessness, a self-centered egomaniac who respects the law only slightly more than the villains he hunts, but also a man who can still make meaningful emotional attachments.Craig strikes a good figure as Bond, and Eva Green is enchanting as Vespar.

But, although I haven't seen all the previous Bond movies (and maybe the only problem is that I've missed the really good ones and seen mostly the 'lesser' entries) it seems to me that there's always been one problem or another getting in the way.  A couple of the chapters where they attempted to make it more humorous, they missed the mark and ended up getting campy.  During a number of the movies, the Bond character himself seemed way too cold and arrogant, less the hero that I figured a 007-type character should be, than a guy who mows down whoever his government tells him to and doesn't really have feelings one way or the other about it.In ""Casino Royale"", ironically, it's not by launching Bond as a more heroic figure but by making him - at the start - colder, meaner and more emotionless than ever, that sets the film off on becoming the best of the series (based on the ten or so I've seen) and among the greatest action/espionage movies ever.  This prequel/remake, starting before James Bond even makes it to Britain's elite 007-status, depicts him in its early stages as a killer without conscience or emotional connections, lethally efficient and ice cold.  As it moves along ""Casino Royale"" neither ignores this seemingly non-heroic status or goes into a detailed backstory, but drops a few hints as to the origins of Bond's persona and what it is that really drives him, under the surface.  The plot of the show has Bond and the UK's intelligence service trailing a group of arms dealers who supply numerous dictators and terrorists worldwide, eventually leading to the world's premiere gambling event.  There, the central mastermind of the arms cartel is trying a last-ditch effort to gather the funds to cover a slew of deals gone bad because of Bond's interference, before his clients, disgruntled over not receiving their merchandise, come looking for him.The relationship that develops between Bond and the female government agent, Vesper Lynd (Eva Green), assigned to him, is totally atypical of the usual agent/girl pair-ups in the Bond series, and it's the story between Bond and Lynd as much as the spy thriller story that makes ""Casino Royale"".  It's done totally convincingly; so are the other aspects of the movie.  The action and stuntwork are fantastic and believable, and I doubt any other movie has ever devoted so much time to a black-tie poker tournament and managed to make it so riveting and entertaining.  Bond is a more nuts-and-bolts fighter here, tending to just beat the living daylights out of the bad guys with his fists instead of using remote-controlled cars with rocket launchers under the hoods.  Daniel Craig brings the character to life with a career-making performance.""Casino Royale"" starts James Bond off seeming to be little more than a cold assassin, develops the character, bringing out hidden aspects of him, and changing him into a more likable figure, then crashes him down to rock bottom psychologically before the final act.  It really remains to be seen which side of the fence he'll have ultimately landed on for future movies, but I hope they continue progressing Bond, and any other returning players, in the future movies rather than just letting ""Casino Royale"" be a stand-alone.  I also hope they'll return as many performers in their Casino roles (such as Judi Dench as M) as possible rather than doing a lot of recasting.  I think the future of the movies could see much more of a focus on a recurring or semi-recurring ensemble, with James Bond still at the center of course.

1048731,A3LXKO2S6G2DBI,B000MNP2K8,"Stephen Kaczmarek ""Educator, Writer, Consultant""","[2, 6]","While Sean Connery still reigns supreme looks-, charisma-, and talent-wise as 007, Daniel Craig gives the classic Bond actor a run for his money in ""Casino Royale,"" the high-octane, high-thrill film that rediscovers the secret agent's mojo.  This adventure, billed as a prequel to the Bond series, is really more of an adjustment, giving Bond both blond locks and a Gen-X history to bring him into the 21st century while distancing him from more recent outtings.  It also jettisons the paint-by-numbers approach of the Pierce Brosnan films, which capitalized on the actor's contemporary model looks and a formula that while comfortably familiar to some was wearing too thin for others.Here, Bond is raw and hungry, a headstrong, macho torpedo who has more in common with the Bond created by Connery than the one popularized by Brosnan.  Not long after brutally earning his 007 status, Bond is sent to capture a terrorist bomber, only to stumble upon a much bigger operation bankrolled by oily gambler Le Chiffre (with a terrifically understated performance by Mads Mikkelsen).  Along the way, he's aided by the charming Mathis (Giancarlo Giannini) and falls for Vesper (vixenish Eva Green), the lovely British agent sent to help him . . . or is she?Staying truer to the spirt of the Fleming novel than much of the film series that followed, ""Casino Royale"" still manages to inject stunning stunt and action sequences, orchestrated with the surprisingly steady hand of director Martin Campbell.  While the generally serious tone of the film (read:  it takes itself seriously) has much to do with its success, most of the credit belongs to Craig, who turns in a performance that somehow mates the deadly frank approach of Timothy Dalton to the confident masculinity of Connery.  The result is the best Bond since Sir Sean stepped down.Other highlights include Dame Judi Dench's meatiest performance as M, a decent, if derivative, score by David Arnold, and a script (polished by Paul Haggis) that gives Bond some smarts again.  Even the romance here works for the most part.  All that said, are there some problems?  Sure.  Good as he is, Craig is still rough around the edges, the film could have benefitted from about 10 minutes more of romance, and there are plot points that are, to put it kindly, murky.  But, hey, if ""Casino Royale"" is the blueprint for future Bond films, then these weaknesses can easily be overlooked.  After all, as someone put it, this is less a James Bond film than a film about James Bond.",5,Good to have James Bond back after all these years,1172793600,"03 2, 2007",2007,2516,"['Sean', 'Connery', 'still', 'supreme', 'looks-', 'charisma-', 'talent-wise', '007', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'classic', 'Bond', 'actor', 'run', 'money', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'high-octane', 'high-thrill', 'film', 'secret', 'agent', 'mojo', 'adventure', 'billed', 'prequel', 'Bond', 'series', 'really', 'more', 'adjustment', 'giving', 'Bond', 'blond', 'locks', 'Gen-X', 'history', 'bring', '21st', 'century', 'distancing', 'more', 'recent', 'outtings', 'also', 'paint-by-numbers', 'approach', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'films', 'capitalized', 'actor', 'contemporary', 'model', 'looks', 'formula', 'comfortably', 'familiar', 'was', 'wearing', 'too', 'thin', 'others.Here', 'Bond', 'raw', 'hungry', 'headstrong', 'macho', 'torpedo', 'who', 'more', 'common', 'Bond', 'created', 'Connery', 'one', 'popularized', 'Brosnan', 'Not', 'long', 'brutally', 'earning', '007', 'status', 'Bond', 'sent', 'capture', 'terrorist', 'bomber', 'only', 'stumble', 'much', 'bigger', 'operation', 'bankrolled', 'oily', 'gambler', 'Le', 'Chiffre', 'terrifically', 'understated', 'performance', 'Mads', 'Mikkelsen', 'way', 'aided', 'charming', 'Mathis', 'Giancarlo', 'Giannini', 'Vesper', 'vixenish', 'Eva', 'Green', 'lovely', 'British', 'agent', 'sent', 'help', 'Staying', 'truer', 'spirt', 'Fleming', 'novel', 'much', 'film', 'series', 'followed', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'still', 'inject', 'stunning', 'stunt', 'action', 'sequences', 'orchestrated', 'surprisingly', 'steady', 'hand', 'director', 'Martin', 'Campbell', 'generally', 'serious', 'tone', 'film', 'read', 'seriously', 'much', 'do', 'success', 'most', 'credit', 'belongs', 'Craig', 'who', 'performance', 'somehow', 'deadly', 'frank', 'approach', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'confident', 'masculinity', 'Connery', 'result', 'best', 'Bond', 'Sir', 'Sean', 'stepped', 'down.Other', 'highlights', 'include', 'Dame', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'meatiest', 'performance', 'M', 'decent', 'derivative', 'score', 'David', 'Arnold', 'script', 'polished', 'Paul', 'Haggis', 'Bond', 'smarts', 'again', 'Even', 'romance', 'here', 'most', 'part', 'said', 'are', 'there', 'problems', 'Sure', 'Good', 'Craig', 'still', 'rough', 'edges', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'benefitted', '10', 'minutes', 'more', 'romance', 'are', 'plot', 'points', 'are', 'put', 'kindly', 'murky', 'hey', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'blueprint', 'future', 'Bond', 'films', 'then', 'weaknesses', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'overlooked', 'someone', 'put', 'less', 'James', 'Bond', 'film', 'film', 'James', 'Bond']",N/A
1048732,A2VP7JOT3K7PFM,B000MNP2K8,"Stephen Pletko ""Uncle Stevie""","[6, 9]","XXXXXThis movie is based on the book ""Casino Royale"" (1953) by the late Ian Fleming.  It is the 21ST  ""official"" (meaning EON Productions) Bond movie with Daniel Craig being the 6TH actor to play James Bond.Before this movie came out, Bond movies covered a period of 40 years beginning with 1962's ""Dr. No"" and ending with 2002's ""Die Another Day.""This movie is about James Bond receiving his ""double oh"" status and completing his first mission as ""007.""The movie's strong points are that it has a lot of action and good special effects.  In fact, before explaining anything to the viewer, there is a long chase scene with death-defying leaps and bounds.  It is quite well done.  There is another long chase scene that follows this chase.  It, too, is quite well done.Unfortunately, the story is difficult to follow and is somewhat complicated.  In fact, I had to view this movie twice in order to completely understand it.It is after about 50 minutes (that's right, 50 minutes!!) into this long movie that you actually learn exactly who Bond was chasing both times and you learn the details of Bond's first assignment.You have to understand two things in order to understand Bond's first assignment: the basics of how stock options work and the basics of a poker game called ""Texas Hold'Em"" (a variation of the poker game called seven card stud).  This, personally, is why I'm amazed that this movie has received such high ratings from others--I don't believe that all people who view this movie know such things.  For the record, I know the basics of these things and, in fact, my interest increased at this point.For Bond's first assignment we're told what he has to do.  Oddly enough, we're not told why he has to do it.  I found this frustrating and had to guess why he was on this assignment.  It turns out I guessed right by reading some articles about this movie after I had viewed it.  The point is that you will have to do some guessing while watching this movie.You may need a brochure to figure out all the bad guys that pop in and out.  The main villain seems to be someone called Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen), ""private banker to the world's terrorists.""  What I noticed is that this villain is not very villainous (except in his last few scenes).The Bond girl has the name of Vesper Lyn (Eva Green).  She's integral to the plot and especially to the movie's long, somewhat predictable, ending.  The ending reminded me of the 1969 Bond movie called ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service.""  Sean Connery who was playing Bond at the time wisely did not perform in this movie.When viewing this movie, don't expect to see the James Bond that you've seen in the last forty years.  There is no Miss Moneypenny, no gun barrel walk, no Q and, thus no gadgets.  (Apparently in the book, Q is not mentioned so there are no gadgets.  Actually, there is a gadget that Bond in this movie uses extensively--a cell phone.)In my mind's eye, I compared Daniel Craig to the other five Bond actors that came before him (namely Sean Connery, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, and Pierce Brosnan).  In my opinion, he doesn't fit the mold of a James bond.  Sure, he's physically fit but there's more to Bond than just being fit!  (Actually, Craig does look like Bond in the last thirty seconds of the movie.)I also missed the Bond music.  The background music is good but does not compare to the distinctive music associated with James Bond movies. (Bond-type music is played when the end credits roll.)The thing I missed most is the James Bond witticisms and snappy dialogue.  For example, here is some dialogue from 1964's ""Goldfinger"" where Bond is tied down on a gold slab with a laser beam cutting the slab and slowly inching up threatening to cut Bond in half:Bond says to Goldfinger: ""You don't expect me to talk, do you?""Goldfinger's priceless reply:  ""No, Mr. Bond.  I expect you to DIE.""Now, this movie is not entirely devoid of humor but it's not nearly as witty as expected.Filming for this movie took place in the Czech Republic, Bahamas, Italy, and England.Finally, the DVD (the one released March, 2007) I have is perfect in picture and sound quality.  There are several interesting extras included on a second disc.In conclusion, for those who are not James Bond fans and looking to see a good action movie, this is the film to see.  However, many true Bond fans may ask themselves the following:""Is this a James Bond movie or is this an action movie that happens to have somebody named James Bond in it?""(2006;  2 hr, 25 min;  wide screen;  2 discs;  28 scenes)&lt;&lt;Stephen Pletko or ""Uncle Stevie,"" London, Ontario, Canada>>XXXXX",3,Is this a James Bond movie or an action movie that has someone named James Bond??

Does that make me an expert? No.  But I do feel I can comment on the film.  It was not one of the best Bond films, just average.  But it had potential to be one of the best.  Don't get me wrong.  I liked the film.  It had some awesome stunts that have been sorely missing since Goldeneye and before that.  The locations were excellent.  The action awesome.  The story brillant.  The villians very cool.  And the girls beautiful and smart.  All elements of an exellent Bond film.  But three elements held it back.1. The critics overhype Craig's performance.  They claim his Bond is closest to the novels.  Not so.  Timothy Dalton's performance was actually closets to the Bond of Ian Fleming.  He took the time to read all the books, to look into the character and to get a feel for how Bond operated.  Craig on the other hand just played the role as he felt Bond should be played.  I understand the producers wanting to break away from the traditional Bond.  But this Bond is actually more reckless than Ian Fleming's.  But Danial Craig does have potential to become great as the character.2. While I don't mind a breaking away from the formula of Bond and trying new territory, please don't mess with certain things that give it the feel of a Bond film.  The first is messing with the gun barrel logo.  This has been used at the very beginning of every Bond film.  To change it takes away from it feeling like a true Bond film.  Second, the gadgets.  They are essential to James Bond as a character on film.  I know it wasn't like this in the books, but we're talking about film.  These are what make it a Bond film.3. And finally, the movie was too long by 15 minutes.  This is what really made it miss it's target.  It was the longest Bond film ever made.  I guessed the ending of the movie long before it happened simply because scences in which ran too long also gave too much plot away.  Simply put they would have made great deleted scence for DVD.  And other certian scence just seemed out of sequence to the movie's pacing.  Case in point the shower scene.  Right after a major action scene, Bond sits back down at the poker table, but before anything happens, it cuts to him entering the room before the story resumes and then proceeds into a useless scene that really had no point to the story.

There have been very controversial and negative gossips and publicities about this upcoming film ever since Sony pictures announced Daniel  Craig for new James Bond.After the screening ended I felt very strange.Well, movie was great.  It has great physical actions, less explosions and CGI, and focusing on characters great plots, great lines with surprisingly great delivery.  It clearly portraits where James Bond was coming from.  So as sake of the criticism of the film, it was darn good film.  The movie was darker and more realistic than previous James Bond sequels, besides On her Majesty Secret Service (which is also great film)  but those elements made this film great.My cons on this film would be:  Daniel Craig's bodybuilders body.  I always except old-fashioned hero as James Bond with natural athlete's body.  Like Once Sean Connery possessed.  And he does not have cookie cutter elegance and charm of Bond.  It does not make him a terrible Bond just to be fair.  I just didn't like to see James Bond is transforming into something different.  Just because of movie got realistic and darker, it lost it's corniness and fantasy aspects of film which is the charm of the franchise, but I think it was inevitable to make this good film.For the best or worst, this franchise has evolved something different, and we all are gonna be judge of this updated Bond franchise..........",4,Great Film!!! but I Got Strange After taste ......,1163721600,"11 17, 2006",2006,1485,"['had', 'such', 'opportunity', 'see', 'film', 'Advanced', 'screening', 'presented', 'Sony', 'last', 'night', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'controversial', 'negative', 'gossips', 'publicities', 'upcoming', 'film', 'ever', 'Sony', 'pictures', 'announced', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'new', 'James', 'Bond.After', 'screening', 'ended', 'felt', 'very', 'strange.Well', 'movie', 'was', 'great', 'great', 'physical', 'actions', 'explosions', 'CGI', 'focusing', 'characters', 'great', 'plots', 'great', 'lines', 'surprisingly', 'great', 'delivery', 'clearly', 'where', 'James', 'Bond', 'was', 'coming', 'sake', 'criticism', 'film', 'was', 'darn', 'good', 'film', 'movie', 'was', 'darker', 'more', 'realistic', 'previous', 'James', 'Bond', 'sequels', 'besides', 'Majesty', 'Secret', 'Service', 'also', 'great', 'film', 'elements', 'made', 'film', 'great.My', 'cons', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'bodybuilders', 'body', 'always', 'old-fashioned', 'hero', 'James', 'Bond', 'natural', 'athlete', 'body', 'Once', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'possessed', 'not', 'have', 'cookie', 'cutter', 'elegance', 'charm', 'Bond', 'not', 'make', 'terrible', 'Bond', 'just', 'be', 'fair', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'see', 'James', 'Bond', 'transforming', 'something', 'different', 'Just', 'movie', 'got', 'realistic', 'darker', 'lost', 'corniness', 'fantasy', 'aspects', 'film', 'charm', 'franchise', 'think', 'was', 'inevitable', 'make', 'good', 'film.For', 'best', 'worst', 'franchise', 'evolved', 'something', 'different', 'are', 'gon', 'na', 'be', 'judge', 'updated', 'Bond', 'franchise']",N/A

Enter ""Casino Royale,"" the first Bond film to be based on an Ian Fleming novel since 1987's ""The Living Daylights."" Fan expectations were high, to say the least. My expectations were no exception. Would Daniel Craig do good? Could they change the format AND stick true to the Bond mythos?After seeing the film, I was happy! ""Casino Royale"" is one of the best films in the series, if not the best. The action sequences are fantastic, with very little use of CG effects. The plot and storytelling, missing from recent entries in the series, are both believable and exceptional. The many twists and turns will have you on the edge of your seat until it's exciting, emotional climax.Daniel Craig makes a fantastic Bond. Unlike recent actors in the role, his 007 is gritty and violent. You don't wanna make him mad. He won't just punch ya, he'll lay into you like a starving man on a Christmas ham. But Craig also manages to give Bond a more emotional edge, making his version of the character the most compelling yet.Eva Green is both smart, funny, and sexy as Vesper Lynd, one of the best Bond girls ever. Mads Mikkelsen is truly sinister as Le Chiffre, but also brings a bit of humanity to the role, making his villain one of the most compelling. Jeffrey Wright and Judy Dench give great performances as well.In conclusion, ""Casino Royale"" has helped resuscitate the Bond franchise, and created the best entry in the series in the last twenty years. Fans will not be disappointed, and non-fans may finally see what's up with Bond!

1048737,AZCDCO6KK2T81,B000MNP2K8,"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan""","[7, 9]","After having seen this new bond, Daniel Craig, and this new style of Bond film, I have to admit that my earlier doubts were for nothing as this film is probably the best in the entire franchise, even if Craig isn't my favorite Bond.  NOTE:  Keep checking the gross for this newest Bond film as it will easily become the most successful Bond film coming in at a cost of $150 million, but bringing in over $500 million.  Somebody must be liking Craig as much as I am.  We may be ""shaken"" up by a new Bond, but the producers are ""stirred"" in the right direction.  Sorry, I couldn't help the pun.  Now, let's take a moment here to review the Bonds of the past.Sean Connery will probably always be the definitive Bond for most of us as he originated the role and was the most successful at blending humor, sexiness, and ruthlessness in a character that is rather flat but ever engaging.  He himself got into a dispute with the Bond producers over money, the lack of character development, excessive use of special effects, and, in his words, ""a tired formula.""  The producers saw fit to replace him with the very forgettable George Lazenby who played Bond in only one film,On Her Majesty's Secret Service.  He damn near sank the franchise because he couldn't act worth a dime.  Connery was rehired to do one more Bond film which lacked some of the effects and grand scale of earlier Bond films in order to appease Connery who disliked that stuff, but ended up quitting the role anyhow after completing one ""official"" Bond film for him.Roger Moore succeeded Connery quite easily because he already had a following due to hisThe Saintseries; however, he was a bit too cartoonish in the role.  He joked far too much and never had that ruthlessness that Connery had and Bond needed, but Moore was, nevertheless, successful throughout most of his tenure as Bond.  An interesting side note here is that Sean Connery returned as admittedly aged Bond in 1983 outside of the normal Bond producers inNever Say Never Againand while Moore beat him at the box office back then, the producers where showing signs of restlessness with Moore as Bond; he ended up doing only one more Bond film.The producers began seek to reinvigorate the franchise in the mid-80's.  They wanted to heed Connery's warning about character development, but also wanted to return to his suave look and ruthless style again only laced with some trademark humor and not some of the silly punchlines Moore was attracted to during his tenure as Bond.  They tried to sign on Pierce Brosnan in 1987 after his popular seriesRemington Steelehad been canceled just as they had signed on Moore after his ""Saint"" series ended.  These two already had a following so-to-speak.  Brosnan was ready and willing, but the Remington Steele producers saw money to be made in all the hype over Brosnan playing Bond that they would not release him from his contract and restored the series to prime-time.  Brosnan then lost the part to Timothy Dalton and his Remington Steele series flopped in its final year and was axed mid-season anyhow.  Brosnan made a series of bad low-budget flicks for awhile before disappearing altogether for a few years.  He then did a cola ad playing a Bond-like character trying to get his drink and this made the studio remember him for later.Although Timothy Dalton never really caught on as Bond (hence he was let go after his two picture deal was completed), his films did well enough, but they were rather forgettable.  The studio wanted Brosnan from day one, but settled on Dalton when they couldn't get him.  Dalton was a departure for the Bond-type in that he was more serious and moody, less humorous, and definitely more ruthless and cold.  This pleased the studio as they wanted some change for Bond; however, the public never caught on to Dalton's Bond even though his versions did well enough at the box office and everyone, including Dalton, seemed happy when his contract was not renewed.  Dalton then all but disappeared from the silver screen.Now depending on how you look at it, this twist of events either helped restore Bond to the more traditional image with the firing of Dalton and the hiring of Brosnan, who Connery himself praised as Bond, or it convinced the studio to never tamper with a formula, tired or successful, again.  Brosnan was a suburb Bond and at a very young looking 54 he certainly had more Bond life left in him.  In addition, unlike Moore who was only a ""passable actor"", and Dalton who was over-the-top serious (come on this ain't Shakespeare), Brosnan was right in the middle, but became a much better actor as the years went on.Once again money and creative disputes caused a rift between the Bond player and the Bond producers and Brosnan was inexcusably fired in the most unprofessional manner, via a fax, after just starring in the most successful of all the Bond films; it raked in $400+ worldwide.  After the success ofBatman Begins, the studio decided to reinvent, to some degree, Bond.  Enter Daniel Craig.Craig's level of believability is more like Dalton's Bond who attempted to bring a moody dark side to the role.  Craig is not as good looking as previous Bonds, but he is a terrific actor and very athletic which is another throw back to Connery.  He may not be the best at blending the various elements of the role as Connery did and to some degree Brosnan too, but he is making the role his own.  He may never become my favorite Bond, but I can't fault his performance and, unlike Dalton's Bond, Craig will be remembered for the role even if it's his only entry into this franchise.  Although the entire franchise was mostly successful and the last Bond film with Brosnan was the highest grossing at the time, it was in need of something new.I will always love Connery's Bond, closely, very closely followed by Brosnan's Bond; however, Craig is an exceptional actor who brings much needed depth to a flat, stereotypical role and the script written by Paul Faggis ofMillion Dollar BabyandCrashfame raises the bar significantly for all future Bond films in that there really is a significant storyline here with surprising twists and turns for a ""formula"" film.  This series of films always lacked suspense because we knew the formula so well, but that is all changed with this entry and that is saying a lot.If this is Craig's only Bond turn, it will be a great loss for the series.  I'm sold on this guy in the role.  I still think Brosnan had several more good Bond films in him and I highly resent the way he was fired, but that shouldn't be taken out on Craig who had no real part in those decisions.  He is a worthy successor to Brosnan who should be on to better things now that he is free from ""Bondage.""  Check out his outstanding performance inThe Matadorlast year and see what a great actor he's become.  I think he's destined for a post-Bond career very much like Connery's.  He has proven to be a diverse actor beyond the Bond films.  You might wanted to also check him out inMrs. Doubtfire, andDante's Peakto see what I mean.",5,Casino Royale was a Gamble Worth Taking,1165795200,"12 11, 2006",2006,7062,"['having', 'seen', 'new',

1048739,A3JDK2RUAXXK3P,B000MNP2K8,Steverino,"[0, 0]","I had SERIOUS doubts about Daniel Craig in this role, but my concerns are long since dead. The new character that Craig brought to Bond was unmistakable. My review of this movie is that you can't get much better than this. Mads Mikkelsen was TREMENDOUS in King Arthur, and excellent here too. Eva Green could not have been more beautiful (I really LOVE the way they didn't airbrush the birthmarks and freckles off this girl to make her look more ""perfect""; she was plenty perfect on her own). Sadly, the second two movies after this did NOT match up to these standards whatsoever....  Casino Royale had: the BEST two Bond girls in a LONG time, EXCELLENT banter back and forth between Bond and Vesper Lynd, the right amount of violence and arrogance from Bond (a la Connery) and BY FAR the best script in a Bond movie since Goldeneye. Everything about this film was better than many before it, and certainly better than Quantum or Skyfall. Skyfall might has well have been any modern day violent thriller, nothing new about the script whatsoever. I was quite disappointed. Last but not least, the intro sequence with the incomparable Chris Cornell on vocals blows you away every time.

1048745,A2FIMQIKNOHFPK,B000MNP2K8,S. White,"[4, 7]","Casino Royale has finally completed a circle for me that was for far too long left in limbo. As as a child growing up in the 70's watching the Connery 007 films on weekend television I was enthralled. However, I was born into the Roger Moore era which didn't always impress me in comparison to Sean Connery's efforts. What was this ineffable 'je ne sais quoi' that the Roger Moore films lacked in comparison to the Sean Connery films? Well, I'll tell you - with the Connery Bond films there was always a dark edge of realism, something gritty and nasty cooking beneath the surface. Bond in the hands of Connery was certainly a darker character and not so politically correct showing clear signs of misogyny and at times out and out chauvinism. Connery played the character as Flemming had imagined him and while Bonds world is no joke he is a man with a black sense of humour.After being spoiled by the greatness of the Connery Bond films as a boy on TV I grew up seeing all the Roger Moore films on the big screen and yet always preferring the Sean Connery treatment. With the 1970's Bond turned more towards a character of largess, exaggeration and buffoonery. The jokes got hammy losing their dark poignancy and as the stunts got bigger the girls became more important than the plot! Under Roger Moore James Bond became a gigolo with a gun rather than an agent of the British Secret Service ... suffice it to say the more unreal and cartoon like the Bond series got the more I lost interest and longed for producers to get back on track with a more Connery like Bond series!It has been a VERY long wait indeed ... the rogues gallery of would be Bonds to follow Roger Moore were really no better with Timothy Dalton doing a passable job in his effort but hardly hitting the mark. Peirce Brosnan was a good choice in theory, if you merely wanted to continue the Roger Moore era of Bond as 'gigolo with gun' trajectory but who would believe Brosnan as a hard boiled and grave British agent like Flemmings creation indicates? Did anyone ever believe for a moment that Brosnan or any of the other pretenders would be able to seriously handle themselves in the kind of lethal close quarters/hand to hand combat witnessed in many of these films?For example, James Bond is the Jason Bourne par excellence and the grandfather of that type of brutal and nasty killing at close range ... Brosnan would be finished in about 3 seconds against experienced killers of the underworld he frequents. Looking at Connery with his build, stature, grave self confidence and bleak sense of humour he always exuded a rugged muscularity and element of mongrel that Bond requires in his line of work ... this is key to Bonds longevity when compared to other 00's! So finally when I heard that they were recasting the character of James Bond I threw my hands up in the air, rolled my eyes and wondered what new guy they might get who could further flog to death the great 007 that Sean Connery had created, YET AGAIN!When the name Daniel Craig was first announced I was indignant simply due to a knee jerk reaction to all others who came before - then I started reading the press and then I started to ignore the press and look at Craig as an actor - I started watching his interviews about the role of Bond and reading some articles. Hmmm, could this guy be the one I had been waiting for the put things right again and to finally carry the mantle of Bond in the Connery tradition? Nothing could be confirmed until I went and saw the film for myself but I usually let the latest Bond release pass by until it hit the DVD stores. What I began to see in the previews and trailers excited me for the first time since my youth and I started to feel like we might just have a worthy successor to Sean Connery finally!So I went and watched Casino Royale as soon as it was released ... the bottom line is that my suspicions were confirmed in the first minutes of the movie. Daniel Craig has completed the circle that Sean Connery left open and I can finally let out a sigh of relief when I say that James Bond has come home to this fan once again.I do not want to get into plot lines or areas of the story but suffice it to say that Daniel Craig brings us a dark, gritty, believable character with no less heart or humanity. He is a Bond with a steely gaze, a man who means business, a character with enough mongrel and rough edges to get the kind of jobs done that only men of that nature can. The buffoonery of previous Bonds is gone but the great action remains and nobody is more pleased than I to have this DVD in my Bond collection which only consists of the Sean Connery Bond Box sets and now this.For producers or movie makers with Bond in mind - take what you have done with Casino Royale and Daniel Craig and don't let it slip through your fingers.CASINO ROYALE is superb!",5,A long

Nevertheless, the film is quite remarkably faithful to the book, including the book's (not the film's) last four words (which I won't repeat as it's a part-spoiler) and the book's refreshing absence of absurd gadgetry. Even the torture scene is the same (except for the rope in place of carpet beater (ouch!)).There are echoes of the earlier (in order of filming, not Bond chronology) films - he wins a vintage Aston Martin, although the Aston doesn't appear until ""Goldfinger"", and he makes a crack to the Treasury girl along the lines of Money Penny (who doesn't appear). It has added the standard current quota of high-adrenalin action, with the characters manifesting physical abilities, resilience and imperviousness to damage bordering on (and frequently transgressing into) the superhuman. But I wish someone would learn that, when you fire a bullet into a tank of inflammable liquid or pressurized gas, it does NOT burst into an instant fireball!And the new James Bond? Very good, but in a solid, ""realistic"" way. Somehow I can't imagine this one being a jolly cricket- and rugger-playing/public school/Oxbridge chap of the type beloved (still) by the British Establishment, the sort of spiffing chaps who ran the British Secret Service in Fleming's day. Moreover, he doesn't deliver the constant stream of glib one-liners (ditto the Bond of the books, of course).And herein perhaps lies the problem. The formula has been changed. The old Bond films, especially the Roger Moore ones, were really tongue-in-cheek, droll comedies masquerading slightly as action films. They thus differentiated themselves in the cinema marketplace. However, with this new style, they are really no different from the rest of the action/thriller pack, such as the Bourne films. Does this successful rejuvenation of a slightly jaded franchise actually represent its eventual demise?

Daniel Craig was born to play Bond. He has everything a James Bond should have: style, grace, elegance, sex appeal, wittiness, and so much more. ""Casino Royale"" also has evrything a James Bond film should have: great villins, sexy leading ladies, action packed sequences, good script, and a wonderful ending. It was also no surprise that ""Casino Royale"" became the biggest money-making Bond film, smashing boxoffice records worldwide. More than any other Bond film we really see the other side that was always lacking in most Bond portrayals in that we see a human side to Bond. This is evident when Bond deals with the death of one of his leading ladies. It is very heartbreaking and the audience becomes instantly warmed to Daniel's performance. I would say ""Casino Royale"" is the best Bond film ever. From a power-packed opening to an exciting finale, ""Casino Royale"" will please the most Bond enthusiasts. The DVD has many bonuses including interviews, trailers, and so much more. However, buy the DVD for the film itself: it outshines all other James Bond films.

For all the Internet belly-aching about choosing Daniel Craig for 007, this has to be a major triumph for him.(Lazenby only did one.  Roger Moore took three films to establish himself.  Timothy Dalton never found Bond's sense of humor.  Pierce Brosnan also had an impressive debut...but then the stories ran dry after that).Everything worked in CASINO ROYALE for me and I've been a Bond fan for my entire life.I reread the original novel last week and appreciated how much of the story appeared in the film (for a change!), as well as the screenwriters' enhancements and developments.

1048758,AYY1M36WKK2AT,B000MNP2K8,"The Twilight Zone ""Bry""","[2, 4]","The Bond film world is made up of 20 or more movies and at least 6 different Bonds (including comic-actor Niven) 7 including the new Bond (Craig). Some people have a nerve to call Craig the greatest Bond, these people may not be fans of or may have missed the 22 previous films (yes I consider the original Casino Royale and NSNA as Bond films). Craig has been miscasted as Bond in my opinion. He doesn't fit or act the bill and the character has been reinvented in a negative less fantastic or cinematic fashion, even to say catering to a different crowd. This James Bond is even to say ""americanized"" and ""overtly-mortalized"" in some ways. I would conclude that if Albert Broccoli or Fleming were alive, they would not be happy with this portrayal of James Bond because it is too different in spirit, by comparison of all previous Bonds of old. Some claim that this film follows the Bond of the book more closely because it is more realistic or blunt. I say no it doesn't because it doesn't get the Bond, spirit or time period correct so what is the point. Bond has always been classy testosterone fueled romantic escapism. This Bond turns that idea of Bond on its head. I can easily say that this is the least entertaining Bond film. Not a bad movie by general movie standards, just a bad Bond movie by Bond movie standards laid down by the pioneers of series. Bond movies were what they were, many classic and entertaining films. All the previous actors who played Bond in the past fit the Bond mold well. Sadly I can't say the same about this, for Daniel Craig is the only one in my opinion who doesn't fit the character. How can someone say that Craig is the best James Bond in the franchises history? Well they must have a different idea for the character, Where Bond isn't great looking, debonair, suave, classy, witty etc.. Bond is now a guy who is just going through the motions and he doesn't seem like a happy guy, and is indeed very flawed. Is this the guy that everyman wishes he was and every woman wishes she was with. Sorry I'd rather be Brosnan, Moore, Connery, Dalton or even Lazenby over Craig any day. Craig's Bond isn't likable and he was seen driving a Ford here?? Beyond those flaws the movie lacks interesting story, villians and the action scenes are few and they concentrate more on the graphic ""realistic"" aspect of violence. Who ever watched a James Bond movie for the realistic aspect of violence? Then again this film was taking Q's more from action films like the Bourne series or police thrillers, not James Bond movies, because the total reivention of the character and movies is apparent. Speaking of Q, he is sadly missed, and its sad that they have thrown things like gadgets and moneypenny out the window. The comic and several other escapists elements of James Bond were one of its good enjoyable qualities. Bond is now just a miscasted and overtly serious drag. It should have never been reinvented as a DRAMA, it has turned pathetic. The worst Bond film ever hands down, depending on your taste and knowledge of the series.

And now we know exactly where he is and when and where he's going to be.Bond: Great, let's go arrest him immediately then, shall we?M: Not yet. In order to recoup his clients' money, LeChiffre is staging a high stakes poker tournament at the Casino Royale in Montenegro.

Is he not? I don't understand why we should do this if it proves nothing and could potentially give LeChiffre back his power if he wins.M: Listen to me, you'll going to Montenegro. We'll send Vesper along to help you, a woman who does not know how to defend herself and who also never had a thorough background check done on her. And while you're there, African warlords are going to try and kill you both. If you kill them, don't worry, because we'll stuff the dead bodies in someone's car and frame him for murder. And if LeChiffre tries to poison you, we'll have an expensive car waiting outside for you with a defibrillator. And after you win the tournament, you should try to avoid getting captured by LeChiffre, for he has a penchant for smashing his male victim's testicles. And hopefully no one will kill LeChiffre, because if he dies we'll be right to where we started...except for your testicles.Bond: Forgive me ma'am, but this sounds like a horrible idea.M: Fine!

The movie kicks off with Bond acquiring his ""OO"" license in a great opening sequence filmed in black and white.  After chasing rogue bombmakers and preventing a terrorist attack at Miami-Dade Airport, Bond finds himself in Montenegro at Casino Royale for a high-stakes poker game organized by Le Chiffre, a financier for the world's terrorists.  Bond must win the game and stop Le Chiffre, or else MI6 will have directly funded terrorism.  Casino Royale serves as the perfect introduction for the new OO7, Daniel Craig.  The movie offers plenty of action, including the high-wire chase through a construction site  and Bond's fight to stop a bomb going off in the Miami airport among several others, but maybe most importantly, it is more realistic, more gritty.  The last few Brosnan Bonds used too many gadgets and CGI, but Casino Royale gets back to basics and overall it leads to a better movie.  Bond fans will not be disappointed, Casino Royale goes back to the tried and true formula that the early Connery films used, a secret agent who must rely on himself to get the job done, no gadgets or gimmicks.When Daniel Craig was announced as the next OO7, there was an uproar by many fans who disapproved of the selection.  But in his first role as Bond, Craig shines as the newly-appointed secret agent with a license to kill.  Since it is the ""first"" introduction to the character, Craig's Bond is allowed to grow as a character, and we see what he becomes in later movies.  All in all, Craig has done a great job giving Bond his tough edge back, and it will be interesting to see how he continues to develop in the next films.  Eva Green is a different breed of Bond girl as Vesper Lynd, the treasury reprsentative who loathes Bond at first but comes to warm to him as she learns more about him and what's he capable of.  Green is very good in the part and provides a perfect challenge for Bond.  Mads Mikkelsen is also good as Le Chiffre, a financier who takes care of terrorists' money and puts together the high-stakes game at Casino Royale.  Judi Dench returns as M, Bond's superior who is pushed to her limit by her agent's actions.  In a very cool but small part, Jeffrey Wright plays Felix Leiter, Bond's CIA equal who finds himself at the poker table.  Also, Giancarlo Giannini plays Mathis, Bond's contact in Montenegro who may or may not be on his side.  Overall, a great cast for Bond 21.The 2-disc DVD is a pretty good package for fans of the movie, but don't be surprised to see another edition released within the year.  It features a beautiful widescreen presentation on Disc 1 and saves all the special features for Disc 2.  ""Becoming Bond"" is a 26-minute featurette that shows the process Daniel Craig went through to become James Bond from the announcement all the way through filming.  ""James Bond: For Real"" details all the stunt work that went into making Casino Royale, and really makes you appreciate the stunts now that you've seen how they did them.  ""Bond Girls are Forever"" is a 47-minute documentary hosted by The Living Daylight's Maryam d'Abo about the history of the Bond girls that has interviews with several, including Ursulla Andress and Halle Berry.  Lastly there is Chris Cornell's music video for ""You Know My Name,"" one of the best Bond songs that I can remember.  While the extras are good, it feels like a lot more could have been done, so maybe hold out for a future release.  With the movie and the features, this DVD is can't miss.

1048768,AV5G37VFE5NVD,B000MNP2K8,Tom Benton,"[6, 11]","CASINO ROYALE is a reboot in the finest sense of the word.  It picks up the slouching James Bond series and not only stands it up straight - it also works it out and beats it until it can do more pushups than Sylvester Stallone on steroids.  After the 20th James Bond screen adventure, DIE ANOTHER DAY, was released in 2002 (forty years after the first 007 thriller, DR. NO), it seemed as though the series could run for a while longer on pure popcorn entertainment, though the dwindling originality and the increasingly stereotypical nature of the films was becoming obvious.  Still, it wasn't clear just how near death the franchise was until CASINO ROYALE.A brief history lesson: in 1961, Ian Fleming, the author of the best-selling James Bond novels, sold the screen rights to his novels to producers Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli.  There was one novel that Saltzman and Broccoli couldn't get the rights to, however: CASINO ROYALE, the first James Bond novel.  Fleming had sold the rights to that novel years earlier when it was adapted as an episode of the American TV series CLIMAX! (starring Barry Nelson as James Bond, with Peter O'Toole as Le Chiffre!); it was also used as the basis for the insane 1967 spy spoof starring Peter Sellers, Woody Allen, and David Niven as James Bond (yes, all three played James Bond).Flash forward 38 years: Sony now owns the rights to CASINO ROYALE, while MGM owns the rights to all the other Bond books.  Flash forward a few years more: Sony buys MGM, thus giving current Bond producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli the chance to finally adapt the first ever James Bond adventure for the big screen.  Reacting to fan criticism over the more recent Bond adventures' over-the-top ""world domination"" storylines and ridiculous gadgetry, Wilson and Broccoli decided to take a page from BATMAN BEGINS' book and ""reboot"" the franchise.  They brought in Paul Haggis, the Academy Award-winning writer of CRASH and MILLION DOLLAR BABY, to co-write the screenplay, and in an extremely controversial move, they released Pierce Brosnan and hired Daniel Craig to play 007.The fan complaints were too numerous to list.  He's blonde!  He looks haggard!  He's not suave, he's just cold!  He's going to be the next George Lazenby!Then they saw the film.CASINO ROYALE isn't a prequel, as it's set in the present, but it is a new beginning for the forty-years-old-plus series.  In CASINO ROYALE, James Bond has just received his Double-O status; to become a Double-O, you must have had to kill two people in the line of duty, as explained in a pre-credits sequence stylishly filmed in black and white.  Bond makes a critical error chasing down a gun-for-hire, and is told by an enraged M. (Judi Dench, reprising her role from Pierce Brosnan's Bond adventures) to stick his head in the sand somewhere.  As we all know, though, James Bond never takes a vacation; instead, he travels to the Bahamas, where he follows the trail of the gun-for-hire - a trail which leads him to Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen), a notorious banker for the world's terrorists.  Bond goes undercover to compete in a high-stakes poker tournament at the ""Casino Royale"".  His mission: bankrupt Le Chiffre.  If this were Sean Connery, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, or Pierce Brosnan, you'd say ""No problem!"".  But Daniel Craig's Bond is a far more realistic and human Bond; nothing comes as easy to him as it did to the previous 007s.As a big fan of Ian Fleming's novels - CASINO ROYALE in particular - I had low expectations for this film.  Imagine my surprise when I walked out of the theater and realized that CASINO ROYALE wasn't simply the best Bond film in five years, ten years, twenty years even: it's the best Bond film ever made.  Daniel Craig surpasses even the god of 007 actors, Sean Connery, whom I previously thought was unsurpassable.  Craig has virtually nothing in common with any previous Bond actor, but he is precisely the 007 of Fleming's novels.  He exudes smoldering masculinity, but in a way less egotistic than the previous Bond actors.  His Bond makes errors, as established in a brilliant chase scene at the start of the film; he doesn't always win, and he lets his temper get the best of him far too often.  He's still a master of knockout one-liners, though, and as Le Chiffre remarks during one of the film's more unforgettable sequences, he has taken very good care of his body.Eva Green is the Bond girl, and what an unusual Bond girl she is; attractive in a classy sort of way, wise, and just as intriguing as Bond himself.  Mikkelsen's Le Chiffre is a despicable villain, with a damaged tear duct which frequently leaks blood.  He at first seems like the stereotypical over-the-top bad guy, but by the end of the film he becomes quite a menacing figure.  Giancarlo Giannini plays an amiable Rene Mathis, a character who featured prominently in a few of Fleming's books but makes his first screen appearance here, while Jeffrey Wright plays the first black Felix Leiter, Bond's best friend, who hasn't appeared in a Bond flick since 1987's THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS.  I was never riveted by Judi Dench's M in the Brosnan films, but she truly shines in CASINO ROYALE.Along with exemplary performances from the cast, there's a frankly epic screenplay by Paul Haggis with Neal Purvis & Robert Wade, who've written all the Bond films since THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH.  This script is very well-structured, and combines all the successful elements of previous Bond films while remaining down-to-earth; I'd imagine Haggis deserves most of the praise for this.  There's tender romance - yes, folks, real romance, not just your standard 007 sex scenes - laugh-out-loud comedy, and the most thoroughly riveting action sequences I've ever seen.  The script has little in common with the book on which it's based; however, if you've never read one of Fleming's Bond books and want to know what they're like, CASINO ROYALE is the closest thing we've ever seen to Ian Fleming's 007.  Some of the scenes and lines from that book are included, though, especially the infamous ""torture scene"", which - though considerably more tame in the film version - will still leave most men cringing as they exit the theater.The first time I began to have faith in this film during its controversy-heavy production was when I learned that Martin Campbell was directing it.  Campbell also directed Pierce Brosnan's debut as 007, GOLDENEYE, an utterly superb entry in the series that revitalized the franchise in much the same way that CASINO ROYALE does.  CASINO ROYALE is the stylish, thrilling Bond adventure that I've been dreaming of for years, and that's due in very large part to Campbell's directing.  He likes to use close camera angles, which work well in adding that ""human"" aspect to the the frequently superhuman character of 007; it feels like we're in the action with Bond, and adds an element of intensity and unpredictability.David Arnold's music is typically loud throughout most of the film.  I've always found the criticism of Arnold's Bond scores to be far too harsh; he mimicks the sound of John Barry's classic scores while adding a dash of his own style, and he does it well.  I'm not quite sure what to make of his music for CASINO ROYALE, though.  A large part of it is your stereotypical James Bond soundtrack - shrill, booming horns with the occasional techno line thrown in for good measure.  However, some of it - namely the love theme for James Bond and Vesper Lynd, Eva Green's character - is truly beautiful, and some of the finest music the series has ever had.  Audioslave's Chris Cornell contributes the film's theme, ""You Know My Name"".  The title's stupid, and the song's nearly as stupid; it's an odd alternative rock composition that just doesn't belong in the film.  It does work, however, in that it takes your mind off the absurd credits sequence.There's as much in CASINO ROYALE to enrage Bond purists as there is to please them.  For one thing, the film does NOT open with the trademark gunbarrel; instead, a music-less gunbarrel pops up moments before the main title sequence.  To make matters worse, the legendary ""James Bond Theme"" doesn't pop up until the end credits - because, of course, in this film James Bond is not the suave agent we know and love until that point.  He doesn't say ""Bond ... James Bond"" until well into the film, and when questioned as to whether he wants his martini shaked or stirred, the irritated new Double-O shoots back, ""Does it look like I give a damn?""  And, as if that's not bad enough, neither Q nor Moneypenny are even mentioned.  That's right - no gunbarrel, no ""Bond ... James Bond"", no theme song, no shaken-not-stirred martinis, no Q, and no Moneypenny.  But you know what?  I couldn't be happier.  That's all perfectly fitting for what's chronologically the first James Bond adventure, and I wouldn't have it any other way.If you loved the intense realism of GOLDENEYE, if you loved the epic love story of ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE, if you loved the non-stop action of DIE ANOTHER DAY, if you loved the grit of LICENCE TO KILL, if you loved the suspense and thrills of FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE - then this is the film you've been waiting for.  Not since FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE or perhaps the seemingly ultimate Bond picture, GOLDFINGER, has the series been so grounded in realism, and never before has a Bond film been so intelligent, so fun, and so compellingly-structured.  Daniel Craig is here to stay, and if the producers can come near matching the quality of CASINO ROYALE on BOND 22, then James Bond will continue to return for years to come.",5,ROYALE

1048769,A3GJGBF7FO8WDJ,B000MNP2K8,"Tom Knapp ""Rambles.NET editor""","[12, 18]","""Casino Royale"" is an exceptional reboot of the James Bond franchise.After 20 successful Bond films starring five actors in the title role, Daniel Craig takes over in a film that takes place at the very start of his career as a 00 agent. M, played by the masterful Judi Dench, hands him his promotion and his fabled ""licence to kill"" after a pre-credits mission to collar an MI6 turncoat; the action after the credits are apparently the new Bond's first adventure as 007.It begins with what must be one of the most amazing foot chases in movie history. By the end of that pulse-pounding scene, you'll be ready to acknowledge Craig as a fitting (and admirably fit) Bond. (For anyone who might confuse this film with the 1967 Bond spoof, they're similar in nothing but name.)Let's cut to the chase: Craig is Bond. But he's not reprising Connery, Brosnan or even Roger Moore; this Bond is entirely new, built from the ground up for a new generation of fans. He's edgier, more physical, without using gadgets and gimmickry as a crutch. This Bond is raw and unpolished, reinventing himself as a 00 agent as he goes, developing the character's notorious emotional detachment and ruthless sense of duty as we watch.And if you don't believe a card game can make for a tense movie experience, you haven't seen this film. But there's more than just cards: Casino Royale has its share of car wrecks, explosions, gun fights, seductions, exotic settings, chases and buildings collapsing into the Grand Canal. Just watch it and let this Bond win you over.by Tom Knapp, Rambles.(n e t) editor",5,A powerful new Bond for the 21st century,1182902400,"06 27, 2007",2007,1577,"['Casino', 'Royale', 'exceptional', 'reboot', 'James', 'Bond', 'franchise.After', '20', 'successful', 'Bond', 'films', 'starring', 'five', 'actors', 'title', 'role', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'over', 'film', 'place', 'very', 'start', 'career', '00', 'agent', 'M', 'played', 'masterful', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'promotion', 'fabled', 'licence', 'kill', 'pre-credits', 'mission', 'collar', 'MI6', 'turncoat', 'action', 'credits', 'are', 'apparently', 'new', 'Bond', 'first', 'adventure', '007.It', 'begins', 'what', 'must', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'amazing', 'foot', 'chases', 'movie', 'history', 'end', 'pulse-pounding', 'scene', ""'ll"", 'be', 'ready', 'acknowledge', 'Craig', 'fitting', 'admirably', 'fit', 'Bond', 'anyone', 'who', 'might', 'confuse', 'film', '1967', 'Bond', 'spoof', ""'re"", 'similar', 'nothing', 'name', 'Let', 'cut', 'chase', 'Craig', 'Bond', 'not', 'reprising', 'Connery', 'Brosnan', 'even', 'Roger', 'Moore', 'Bond', 'entirely', 'new', 'built', 'ground', 'up', 'new', 'generation', 'fans', 'edgier', 'more', 'physical', 'using', 'gadgets', 'gimmickry', 'crutch', 'Bond', 'raw', 'unpolished', 'reinventing', '00', 'agent', 'developing', 'character', 'notorious', 'emotional', 'detachment', 'ruthless', 'sense', 'duty', 'watch.And', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'card', 'game', 'can', 'make', 'tense', 'movie', 'experience', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'more', 'just', 'cards', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'share', 'car', 'wrecks', 'explosions', 'gun', 'fights', 'seductions', 'exotic', 'settings', 'chases', 'buildings', 'collapsing', 'Grand', 'Canal', 'Just', 'watch', 'let', 'Bond', 'win', 'over.by', 'Tom', 'Knapp', 'Rambles', 'n', 'e', 't', 'editor']",N/A
1048770,A2U974OZOVRT7A,B000MNP2K8,Tom Without Pity,"[1, 2]","This is review for the 2006 James Bond film, CASINO ROYALEwhich was released on DVD in 2007 by Sony.I must admit that I was a Bond fan during the Sean Connery erabut drifted away after Mr. Connery left the series.  I didsee one of the Roger Moore Bonds and George Lazenby'sdebut/farewell into the series.  But overall I just couldn'tsee anyone but Sean Connery make me sit still and believe thathe was Agent 007.That is until I decided to watch the newer James Bond, played byDaniel Craig, who quite honestly was an actor I had never even heard of.I was very surprised by the vigor and intensity with which Mr. Craig broughtto the James Bond role and the whole film, CASINO ROYALE, semed to get a liftas a result of the new Bond's energy and strength. Of course a lot if not mostof the credit must go to director Martin Campbell for this fine new editionof Bond.  Even though this production is all new I think it's fair to saythat the Bond excitement that first revealed itself onscreen almost fifty yearsago has returned and returned big time.I'm certain that  the whole production team has been overhauled and maybe I ammaking a little too much about the influence of the star but the new lookJames Bond is almost riveting when it comes to the exciting chances thecharacter takes and the risks that he must go through to succeed.CASINO ROYALE is an amazing film and the performance of Daniel Craig was a revelation to me and as I can see by many of these reviews  other film goersas well.Five Stars.",4,Not Your Father's Bond--Or Maybe It Is,1283990400,"09 9, 2010",2010,1502,"['review', '2006', 'James', 'Bond', 'film', 'CASINO', 'ROYALEwhich', 'was', 'released', 'DVD', '2007', 'Sony.I', 'must', 'admit', 'was', 'Bond', 'fan', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'erabut', 'drifted', 'away', 'Mr.', 'Connery', 'left', 'series', 'didsee', 'one', 'Roger', 'Moore', 'Bonds', 'George', ""Lazenby'sdebut/farewell"", 'series', 'overall', 'just', ""couldn'tsee"", 'anyone', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'make', 'sit', 'still', 'believe', 'thathe', 'was', 'Agent', '007.That', 'decided', 'watch', 'newer', 'James', 'Bond', 'played', 'byDaniel', 'Craig', 'who', 'quite', 'honestly', 'was', 'actor', 'had', 'never', 'even', 'heard', 'of.I', 'was', 'very', 'surprised', 'vigor', 'intensity', 'Mr.', 'Craig', 'broughtto', 'James', 'Bond', 'role', 'whole', 'film', 'CASINO', 'ROYALE', 'semed', 'get', 'liftas', 'result', 'new', 'Bond', 'energy', 'strength', 'course', 'lot', 'not', 'mostof', 'credit', 'must', 'go', 'director', 'Martin', 'Campbell', 'fine', 'new', 'editionof', 'Bond', 'Even', 'production', 'new', 'think', 'fair', 'saythat', 'Bond', 'excitement', 'first', 'revealed', 'onscreen', 'almost', 'fifty', 'yearsago', 'returned', 'returned', 'big', 'time.I', ""'m"", 'certain', 'whole', 'production', 'team', 'been', 'overhauled', 'maybe', 'ammaking', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'influence', 'star', 'new', 'lookJames', 'Bond', 'almost', 'riveting', 'when', 'exciting', 'chances', 'thecharacter', 'risks', 'must', 'go', 'succeed.CASINO', 'ROYALE', 'amazing', 'film', 'performance', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'was', 'revelation', 'can', 'see', 'many', 'reviews', 'other', 'film', 'goersas', 'well.Five', 'Stars']",N/A
1048771,A2UNMXBJSVIXFB,B000MNP2K8,Tony Khamvongsouk,"[6, 8]","Movie - 5.0Growing up I was a casual Bond fan, maybe a little more than casual, but not quite die-hard. I appreciated the franchise for its style, sleek atmosphere, British charm, and sex appeal with all those girls. Somewhere down the line my tastes developed into something a little beyond the flash and pizazz that I started to grow weary of. And by the time Pierce Brosnan starred in his final film as Agent 007, I'm afraid to say I was starting to lose interest in the same old formula and presentation. Then came Bond 21, Casino Royale, starring a complete newcomer I'd never even heard of in Daniel Craig. Suffice it to say, Casino Royale is a much needed reboot of the classic character. Not only is there a new actor, but also a new tone that completely rejuvenates the franchise from square one. Here we see Craig portraying Bond as a rookie hotshot who's just earned his Double-O status. He's young, brash, full of energy, and borderline uncontrollable acting on impulse and emotion, though with just enough of that cool, collected debonair most of us are probably accustomed to seeing. However, as many young and overconfident hotshots often realize soon after, there needs to be a lesson of moderation learned. Enter Vesper Lynd who allows us to see a side of Bond that is so much more down-to-earth and actually humanized that one would never have thought possible. But with this being Bond, we certainly can't expect such a happy ending. Soon after their relationship really starts to blossom betrayal ensues and Bond is livid to conclude things the only way he knows best -- with cold, brutal efficiency. To be continued in Quantum of Solace. To really appreciate these movies for their writing I recommend you watch both, not as a movie and its sequel, but two parts of one long and personal narrative. I don't want to spoil the journey Bond makes between here and there, but read both reviews and you'll understand.Video - 4.5From the black and white flashback to the African Rundown to the lush and beautiful landscapes of the Bahamas, Italy, etc., every single frame is full of depth and color vibrancy. Skin textures are very fine and especially detailed with just enough film grain to give it that gritty, atmospheric feel reflected in the films' writing. Contrast and black levels are strong as well during the night and dimly-lit scenes. My favorite shots are from the poker game. Not only is there a great degree of sharpness to the face shots of the players, but the poker chips and various colors of tables, clothes, and drinks really stand out, only adding that Bond-level of material extravagance to the film's overall temperament. While not the most exciting reference scene I would recommend, it's certainly a very good part to watch, though you could easily use any of the overview shots of landscapes or grandiose action sequences as well. On the downside, I did notice a few minor instances of artifacts and debris, especially in the scene where Bond is talking to M in the Bahamas where this inexplicably large speck flashes on the screen, but other than that, everything else looks relatively flawless.Audio - 5.0To this date, Casino Royale remains atop my ""loudest movies"" list up there with Hellboy II, Fight Club, and The Bourne Ultimatum. The Dolby TrueHD 5.1 track here is as amazing as the video transfer. From the very get-go in the opening flashback scene we're surrounded in this pool of sound filled with tough, gut-thumping effects and immersed in a masterful soundtrack by David Arnold. I wanna' say that in addition to the very active sound field, I'm especially enamored with how well the music is separated and integrated evenly through each speaker. With that said, directionality and dynamics are exuberantly punctuated when the more hellish scenes with gunfire and crashing objects are on screen. LFEs, particularly through the music, will rock your room, if not your house. Explosions, crumbling environments, and all the sort have a great depth of bass. Dialogue (a large majority of the film) is crisp with no disparities at any point in the film, making for yet another title of reference quality. No-brainer demo material would be either the African Rundown at the beginning of the movie or the Collapsing Palazzo at the end.Extras - 5.0Owning the initial release from '07, I gladly double-dipped for this Collector's Edition when hearing there would be a separate BD containing many new special features. Of most interest were the vignettes talking about the history and stigma that were carried by this particular novel, how the rights remained in limbo for so long, and how it all came about in the first place up to where the idea of the movie was reconceived as the new starting point for the franchise. I have to say, I was amazed at just how complicated the entire ordeal turned out. In addition, there are also many, many other features that cover production design, shooting logistics, cast and crew interviews, and a somewhat brief look back on the iconography of Bond up to this newest installment. Time-wise, I'm pretty sure there are at least three plus hours of Extras between the new and old stuff from the previous release, of which most are in HD. Of course, most of this material is covered in the equally informative commentary if you don't mind watching the movie again. Big thanks to Sony for giving this fine film the set of extras it deserves.Overall - 5.0So yeah, Bond was starting to become stagnant around the end of the Brosnan era for me. And of all the novels to be filmed, the very first, albeit troubled, one in Casino Royale was picked. Not only did it revitalize the franchise by taking things back to basics and creating a darker, grittier atmosphere, but it did so in such stunning fashion thanks in huge part to the superb effort given by Daniel Craig and veteran Bond director Martin Campbell. A wonderfully written, photographed, and coordinated film, Casino Royale along with its direct sequel Quantum of Solace, which for all intents and purposes is just the third act of a very long film (again, read the review for my interpretation), are currently my top action/drama/spy/thriller titles of all-time. Presented with reference A/V specs by Sony and a long-awaited, very thorough, package of special features, this Collector's Edition is a must own piece of film-making for any Bond fan or movie

1048772,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B000MNP2K8,trebe,"[0, 0]","Albert Broccoli and Harry Saltzman first brought James Bond to the cinema in Dr. No (1962).  In the years that followed, with one exception, the two men adapted all of Ian Fleming's full length Bond novels into motion pictures.  Now over forty years later, that omission in addressed, as Daniel Craig makes his debut as Bond, the MI6 agent, licensed to kill in Casino Royale, based on Fleming's very first Bond novel, originally published in 1953.Each actor that assumes the role of Bond, is subjected to immense scrutiny and criticism.  Being fair haired, and looking nothing like past Bonds, is a superficial gripe against Craig.  What is hard to swallow is that someone as old as Craig (38), is supposed to be a newcomer to the double O classification.  Craig, comes to the role of Bond, looking tougher and more weathered, than Pierce Bronsnan did leaving it at age 49.  Craig being nervous about killing is a joke.  This Bond doesn't need any of Q Branch's gadgets, he will just shoot you dead, or snap your neck with his bare hands.In the film's first action sequence Bond engages in what is probably the most physically challenging, one on one, on foot pursuit in the history of the franchise.  The deadly serious pursuit of Mollaka (Stebastien Foucan), on and across the crane arms is so demanding, that no previous Bond would have been physically capable of attempting it.  Craig is overpoweringly masculine, and dominates the screen wherever the setting, be it Madagascar, the Bahamas, Montenegro, or Venice.The key element from Fleming's original story remains the same (except that the original game was baccarat), but how plausible is it that in 2006 an international criminal, and the British and American governments, would do battle at a poker table?  With the explosion in popularity of Texas hold 'em tournaments on television, watching the play here is pretty boring, regardless of how much the drama is forced.  Gambling aside, Casino Royale works well enough.  Head villain Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen), goes through the movie with a sour expression, failing at every turn, and besides being a vicious ball slapper, doesn't really distinguish himself as a memorable villain.The Bond women are also the subject of scrutiny.  The exotically beautiful Caterina Murino makes a brief appearance in a sacrificial role.  The casting of Vesper Lynd is critical, as like the Contessa Teresa (Tracy) Di Vicenzo, in `On Her Majesty's Secret Service', this is a woman who captures Bond heart.  While Diana Rigg was an actress with considerable stature, it might be difficult to say the same for Eva Green (The Golden Compass), who apparently was a late selection to play Lynd.  While her performance is serviceable, whether she was the ideal choice is a very open question.  Some may not question what happens between Lynd and Bond, because the new Bond is such an unknown.The remake of Bond into a harder edged character, was an opportunity for the producers to take the character into the R rated category.  Surely teens have many others they relate to more than a middle aged, British spy, fighting the last war?  Instead Bond remains in the PG-13 cage.  The finale in a collapsing building in Venice is nicely done, and at the end of the mission, with M (Judi Dench) providing a little TLC, all the pieces have fallen in place, and Bond ends the film uttering his most famous line.  It has flaws, but Casino Royale is quite nicely done.The 2 disc version is an intermediate release, without the typically comprehensive Bondian special features.  Maryam d'Abo (The Living Daylights) has taken up being a `Bond Girl' as a cause, and an updated version of her documentary `Bond Girls Are Forever' (48 minutes) is included.  The somewhat curious selection does help pad the content, that also includes the featurettes 'Becoming Bond' (26 minutes), 'James Bond: For Real' (23 minutes), and Chris Cornell's music video for 'You Know My Name'.  The two disc version has since been surpassed by the upgraded blu-ray version, which has commentary tracks, and additional extras.",4,the 'new' Bond . . . back to the blunt instrument days with Daniel Craig . . .,1256428800,"10 25, 2009",2009,4080,"['Albert', 'Broccoli', 'Harry', 'Saltzman', 'first', 'brought', 'James', 'Bond', 'cinema', 'Dr.', 'No', '1962', 'years', 'followed', 'one', 'exception', 'two', 'men', 'adapted', 'Ian', 'Fleming', 'full', 'length', 'Bond', 'novels', 'motion', 'pictures', 'Now', 'forty', 'years', 'later', 'omission', 'addressed', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'debut', 'Bond', 'MI6', 'agent', 'licensed', 'kill', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'based', 'Fleming', 'very', 'first', 'Bond', 'novel', 'originally', 'published', '1953.Each', 'actor', 'role', 'Bond', 'subjected', 'immense', 'scrutiny', 'criticism', 'Being', 'fair', 'haired', 'looking', 'nothing', 'past', 'Bonds', 'superficial', 'gripe', 'Craig', 'What', 'hard', 'swallow', 'someone', 'as', 'old', 'Craig', '38', 'supposed', 'be', 'newcomer', 'double', 'O', 'classification', 'Craig', 'role', 'Bond', 'looking', 'tougher', 'more', 'weathered', 'Pierce', 'Bronsnan', 'did', 'leaving', 'age', '49', 'Craig', 'being', 'nervous', 'killing', 'joke', 'Bond', ""n't"", 'need', 'Q', 'Branch', 'gadgets', 'will', 'just', 'shoot', 'dead', 'snap', 'neck', 'bare', 'film', 'first', 'action', 'sequence', 'Bond', 'what', 'probably', 'most', 'physically', 'challenging', 'one', 'one', 'foot', 'pursuit', 'history', 'franchise', 'deadly', 'serious', 'pursuit', 'Mollaka', 'Stebastien', 'Foucan', 'crane', 'arms', 'so', 'demanding', 'previous', 'Bond', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'physically', 'capable', 'attempting', 'Craig', 'overpoweringly', 'masculine', 'screen', 'setting', 'be', 'Madagascar', 'Bahamas', 'Montenegro', 'Venice.The', 'key', 'element', 'Fleming', 'original', 'story', 'same', 'original', 'game', 'was', 'baccarat', 'how', 'plausible', '2006', 'international', 'criminal', 'British', 'American', 'governments', 'would', 'do', 'battle', 'poker', 'table', 'explosion', 'popularity', 'Texas', 'hold', 'tournaments', 'television', 'watching', 'play', 'here', 'pretty', 'boring', 'regardless', 'how', 'much', 'drama', 'forced', 'Gambling', 'aside', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'well', 'enough', 'Head', 'villain', 'Le', 'Chiffre', 'Mads', 'Mikkelsen', 'movie', 'sour', 'expression', 'failing', 'turn', 'being', 'vicious', 'ball', 'slapper', ""n't"", 'really', 'distinguish', 'memorable', 'villain.The', 'Bond', 'women', 'are', 'also', 'subject', 'scrutiny', 'exotically', 'beautiful', 'Caterina', 'Murino', 'brief', 'appearance', 'sacrificial', 'role', 'casting', 'Vesper', 'Lynd', 'critical', 'Contessa', 'Teresa', 'Tracy', 'Di', 'Vicenzo', 'Her', 'Majesty', 'Secret', 'Service', 'woman', 'who', 'Bond', 'heart', 'Diana', 'Rigg', 'was', 'actress', 'considerable', 'stature', 'might', 'be', 'difficult', 'say', 'same', 'Eva', 'Green', 'Golden', 'Compass', 'who', 'apparently', 'was', 'late', 'selection', 'play', 'Lynd', 'performance', 'serviceable', 'was', 'ideal', 'choice', 'very', 'open', 'question', 'may', 'not', 'question', 'what', 'Lynd', 'Bond', 'new', 'Bond', 'such', 'unknown.The', 'remake', 'Bond', 'harder', 'edged', 'character', 'was', 'opportunity', 'producers', 'take', 'character', 'R', 'rated', 'category', 'Surely', 'teens', 'have', 'many', 'others', 'relate', 'more', 'middle', 'aged', 'British', 'spy', 'fighting', 'last', 'war', 'Instead', 'Bond', 'PG-13', 'cage', 'finale', 'collapsing', 'building', 'Venice', 'nicely', 'done', 'end', 'mission', 'M', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'providing', 'little', 'TLC', 'pieces', 'have', 'fallen', 'place', 'Bond', 'film', 'uttering', 'most', 'famous', 'line', 'flaws', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'quite', 'nicely', 'done.The', '2', 'disc', 'version', 'intermediate', 'release', 'typically', 'comprehensive', 'Bondian', 'special', 'features', 'Maryam', ""d'Abo"", 'Living', 'Daylights', 'taken', 'up', 'being', 'Bond', 'Girl', 'cause', 'updated', 'version', 'documentary', 'Bond', 'Girls', 'Are', 'Forever', '48', 'minutes', 'included', 'somewhat', 'curious', 'selection', 'help', 'pad', 'content', 'also', 'featurettes', ""'Becoming"", 'Bond', '26', 'minutes', 'Bond', 'Real', '23', 'minutes', 'Chris', 'Cornell', 'music', 'video', ""'You"", 'Know', 'My', 'Name', 'two', 'disc', 'version', 'been', 'surpassed', 'upgraded', 'blu-ray', 'version', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'additional', 'extras']",N/A
1048773,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B000MNP2K8,Trevor Willsmer,"[0, 1]","As one of the only 12 people who was genuinely delighted at Daniel Craig's casting a year ago, I must admit I was more than a little worried about Casino Royale. Not the kind of paranoia that those newcomers who'd never experience the changing of the guard the series goes through every decade or the staggeringly venomous hate-mongering of the more fanatical Brosnan fans who felt compelled to start libellous hate-sites, though. After all those months of arguing that he was the perfect choice for the role (especially after some of the more moronic suggestions), was I setting myself up for a fall if he turned in a disappointing performance? Similarly there was the film itself. While the producers were making all the right noises about going back to basics, they'd done exactly the same with Licence To Kill and chickened out to deliver a sub-Roger Moore effort with Wayne Newton as a comedy relief villain, inept ninjas, pointless gadgets, laughable violence and monster truck stunts. Too often in the past the franchise had been over-reliant on the goodwill generated by the earlier films, rehashing earlier vehicles to decreasing returns secure in the knowledge that the audience would turn up anyway. Take away the Bond brand, and too many post-OHMSS entries simply wouldn't have stood up to scrutiny in the marketplace on their own merits: Bond had become a tradition, a ritual like going home for the holidays that you knew was never going to be as good as it was when you were a kid but which you still went through out of a mixture of hope and obligation.I needn't have worried. Not only is it the best Bond film in 37 years, it's as if the Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan years never happened. After Brosnan's surprisingly lazy and slightly seedy turn in DAD, Craig delivers the most physical Bond since Lazenby, but this time matched by the acting chops to make the most of the best script the series has had in decades - at once plot and character led - as the rookie blunt instrument bulldozes his way through his mission until emotional awakening and betrayal starts to finesse him into the Bond we knew from the Connery days. Brosnan never could have delivered this kind of performance, either physically or emotionally, and, truth be told, neither could Connery in his prime: Craig is the first one to convince you that he's not a movie star or an actor but that he really IS James Bond.The updating of the plot from the Cold War era to a post 9/11 world works surprisingly well, with the first act managing to provide a convincing motive for the high stakes poker game centrepiece while also providing a couple of superb action scenes that don't become too absurd and serve the plot in a series where in the past the plot was too often an excuse for the action. The much-criticised change from baccarat to poker is a smart one too. Where Baccarat is purely a game of luck (as Fleming himself found out when he went bust in three hands trying out the novel's premise on a Nazi spy), poker actually involves both strategy and psychology, making for more satisfying drama and tension.There is, sadly, one concession to gadgetry that veers into the absurd - c'mon, who keeps a defibrillator in their glove compartment? - and is an unwelcome reminder of the days when old Roge would get out of a scrape with his buzz saw wristwatch or his projectile dart cufflinks thanks to lazy writing, but elsewhere it settles for using existing technology (most of it manufactured by Sony for some reason that escapes me) rather than veering into total fantasy. And it's good to see a Bond who needs hospitalisation after the villain goes Quasimodo on his nuts with a bell rope. The film's final sequence promises one helluva follow-up, and one can only hope the producers don't lose their nerve and throw it all away the way they did with Diamonds Are Forever. The real James Bond is indeed back.Extras-wise the 2-disc DVD is a disappointment by the standards of the previous EON entries, although there is reportedly a more elaborate special edition planned in the future.",5,Sean who?,1202860800,"02 13, 2008",2008,4078,"['one', 'only', '12', 'people', 'who', 'was', 'genuinely', 'delighted', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'casting', 'year', 'ago', 'must', 'admit', 'was', 'more', 'little', 'worried', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'Not', 'kind', 'paranoia', 'newcomers', 'who', ""'d"", 'never', 'experience', 'changing', 'guard', 'series', 'decade', 'staggeringly', 'venomous', 'hate-mongering', 'more', 'fanatical', 'Brosnan', 'fans', 'who', 'felt', 'compelled', 'start', 'libellous', 'hate-sites', 'months', 'arguing', 'was', 'perfect', 'choice', 'role', 'especially', 'more', 'moronic', 'suggestions', 'was', 'setting', 'up', 'fall', 'turned', 'disappointing', 'performance', 'Similarly', 'was', 'film', 'producers', 'were', 'making', 'right', 'noises', 'going', 'back', 'basics', ""'d"", 'done', 'exactly', 'same', 'Licence', 'Kill', 'chickened', 'out', 'deliver', 'sub-Roger', 'Moore', 'effort', 'Wayne', 'Newton', 'comedy', 'relief', 'villain', 'inept', 'ninjas', 'pointless', 'gadgets', 'laughable', 'violence', 'monster', 'truck', 'stunts', 'Too', 'often', 'past', 'franchise', 'had', 'been', 'over-reliant', 'goodwill', 'generated', 'earlier', 'films', 'rehashing', 'earlier', 'vehicles', 'decreasing', 'returns', 'secure', 'knowledge', 'audience', 'would', 'turn', 'up', 'anyway', 'Take', 'away', 'Bond', 'brand', 'too', 'many', 'post-OHMSS', 'entries', 'simply', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'stood', 'up', 'scrutiny', 'marketplace', 'own', 'merits', 'Bond', 'had', 'become', 'tradition', 'ritual', 'going', 'home', 'holidays', 'knew', 'was', 'never', 'going', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'was', 'when', 'were', 'kid', 'still', 'went', 'mixture', 'hope', 'obligation.I', 'need', ""n't"", 'have', 'worried', 'Not', 'only', 'best', 'Bond', 'film', '37', 'years', 'Roger', 'Moore', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'years', 'never', 'happened', 'Brosnan', 'surprisingly', 'lazy', 'slightly', 'seedy', 'turn', 'DAD', 'Craig', 'most', 'physical', 'Bond', 'Lazenby', 'time', 'matched', 'acting', 'chops', 'make', 'most', 'best', 'script', 'series', 'had', 'decades', 'once', 'plot', 'character', 'led', 'rookie', 'blunt', 'instrument', 'way', 'mission', 'emotional', 'awakening', 'betrayal', 'starts', 'finesse', 'Bond', 'knew', 'Connery', 'days', 'Brosnan', 'never', 'could', 'have', 'delivered', 'kind', 'performance', 'physically', 'emotionally', 'truth', 'be', 'told', 'could', 'Connery', 'prime', 'Craig', 'first', 'one', 'convince', 'not', 'movie', 'star', 'actor', 'really', 'James', 'Bond.The', 'updating', 'plot', 'Cold', 'War', 'era', 'post', '9/11', 'world', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'first', 'act', 'managing', 'provide', 'convincing', 'motive', 'high', 'stakes', 'poker', 'game', 'centrepiece', 'also', 'providing', 'couple', 'superb', 'action', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'become', 'too', 'absurd', 'serve', 'plot', 'series', 'where', 'past', 'plot', 'was', 'too', 'often', 'excuse', 'action', 'much-criticised', 'change', 'baccarat', 'poker', 'smart', 'one', 'too', 'Where', 'Baccarat', 'purely', 'game', 'luck', 'Fleming', 'found', 'out', 'when', 'went', 'bust', 'three', 'hands', 'trying', 'out', 'novel', 'premise', 'Nazi', 'spy', 'poker', 'actually', 'strategy', 'psychology', 'making', 'more', 'satisfying', 'drama', 'sadly', 'one', 'concession', 'gadgetry', 'veers', 'absurd', ""c'mon"", 'who', 'defibrillator', 'glove', 'compartment', 'unwelcome', 'reminder', 'days', 'when', 'old', 'Roge', 'would', 'get', 'scrape', 'buzz', 'saw', 'wristwatch', 'projectile', 'dart', 'cufflinks', 'thanks', 'lazy', 'writing', 'elsewhere', 'using', 'existing', 'technology', 'most', 'manufactured', 'Sony', 'reason', 'rather', 'veering', 'total', 'fantasy', 'good', 'see', 'Bond', 'who', 'hospitalisation', 'villain', 'Quasimodo', 'nuts', 'bell', 'rope', 'film', 'final', 'sequence', 'one', 'helluva', 'follow-up', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'producers', 'do', ""n't"", 'lose', 'nerve', 'throw', 'away', 'way', 'did', 'Diamonds', 'Are', 'Forever', 'real', 'James', 'Bond', 'indeed', 'back.Extras-wise', '2-disc', 'DVD', 'disappointment', 'standards', 'previous', 'EON', 'entries', 'reportedly', 'more', 'elaborate', 'special', 'edition', 'planned', 'future']",N/A
1048774,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000MNP2K8,Tsuyoshi,"[4, 5]","The film has already got positive reviews from many critics, most of which are more or less based on the film's new James Bond image. We must give due credit to Daniel Craig for reinventing Bond, making him a tougher and meaner super-spy. Of course some people just don't want re-inventing it, but even they would admit Bond series needed something refreshing. At least Martin Campbell did it successfully, but totally in a different way from in `GoldenEye.'Many reviewers have rightly pointed out the differences of the newer Bond. You will notice (and perhaps regret) the absence of gadgets (and Q or R) in the film, but actually the most notable one is that they set the plot in the post 9/11 era. The story is about the earliest days of 007, but the changed setting lends considerable power to the intense actions, some of which are more violent than you expect. And there is one torture scene.`Casino Royale' contains three big action sequences, and they are all really thrilling ones - the first one at the construction site includes lots of eye-popping stunts - but as I said, there is something dark and serious undertone in some of them. While watching Pierce Brosnan's Bond (which I like), I never took anything seriously. This cannot be said about `Casino Royale' where one long action sequence takes place at airport.Not that the film is free from escapism, In fact the main story involves a silly idea about the confrontation between a terrorist banker and a British agent at a card table, and the latter being backed up by the government's money! Eva Green plays Vesper who is in charge of the money, but in spite of the beauty of Ms Green Bond's romance with her is the least effective in the film.`Casino Royale' marks the successful return of James Bond with Daniel Craig in character, but not all fans would love it.

The series had become too reliant on gadgetry, visual FX, and especially sex and it needed to stop. Perhaps worst of all, the character had become too much of an international, womanizing playboy, too jovial for what Ian Fleming had originally thought the character should be.Bond is therefore forced to rely more on his military training, his intelligence, investigative skills and his wits to complete his mission. He also has to rely on his competitive edge, especially during the lengthy poker match. Instead of relying on the legendary ability of the character to win in the end, Bond really has to work for his victory.

1048779,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B000MNP2K8,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[1, 1]","I admit that I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I first watched CASINO ROYALE. I had eagerly been looking forward to this James Bond movie because it was Ian Fleming's first novel starring Bond. The novel had been adapted to the screen before, but only as a comedy parody and a lukewarm made-for-television movie. This version of CASINO ROYALE was to be an &#34;official&#34; part of the James Bond cinematic canon. It was going to be the movie that explained the beginnings of James Bond's career as Britain's top secret agent. Production and filming began and then suddenly stopped. The studios decided that to keep the James Bond franchise viable they needed a new approach. So, they fired Pierce Brosnan. They fired some of the screenwriters and sent the script Paul Haggis for a rewrite because the film wasn't dark enough.Oh, and did I mention they fired Pierce Brosnan? Brosnan was the best actor to portray James Bond since Sean Connery originally played the character. In fact, not so long ago, Brosnan's portrayal of James Bond saved the franchise from total ruin and in doing so also prevented a certain film studio from going bankrupt. Brosnan was not only the right man for the role, he was the perfect man for the role. Had he not been fired and had he been willing (which he probably would have) he could have played James Bond for another two or three pictures. He should have played Bond for a few more movies. Instead, the filmmakers decided to start virtually from scratch. Pierce Brosnan was fired and Daniel Craig was eventually hired in his place.In the merrie ole land of England, when the news was released, James Bond fans in Britain went nuts. Protests were held and letters were written. Craig couldn't be Bond. Craig is average height, but traditionally Bond has been portrayed as being tall. Also, Craig has blond hair and Bond is supposed to have dark hair. The thing I found most interesting about the choice is that Craig is virtually an unknown actor in the United States. Outside of his performance in the artsy film LAYER CAKE no one in the U.S. had ever heard of Craig before he was announced as the next James Bond. Considering the tone of CASINO ROYALE, this is strange because CASINO ROYALE is the most Americanized of all James Bond pictures even though Bond is a very British character (for example, the high stakes game of gambling that is central to the film's plot revolves around Texas Hold `Em. You can't get any more Americanized than that). I guess the filmmakers felt they were offending their core audience enough the way it was and didn't want to turn them totally off by hiring someone like Brad Pitt or Matt Damon.In CASINO ROYALE, the audience witnesses James Bond's first two assassinations; the two killings that allow him the double zero and validate his license to kill. This opening sequence is followed by the usual opening credits song and like half the Bond movies that have ever been made, it was far too long. We next find Bond racing through the streets and leaping from buildings like Superman somewhere in Africa. The chase and the ensuing events which follow cause an international controversy and thanks to a camera-phone Bond finds himself on the cover of newspapers. He's taken off duty for a while and M (Judy Dench) tells him to take a vacation. He does, but uses the opportunity to do some spying on his spare time. He stalks a businessman who bleeds out of eyes and who seems to be supplementing his gun-running operation by playing in high stakes poker games. Bond is selected to play in the next high-stakes game that the villain, Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen) is playing in. The game takes place in Monte Carlo and Bond is escorted to the event by the beautiful and intelligent Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) whom is being sent to insure that the millions of dollars in investment aren't wasted in vain. There is a connection between Lynd and Bond, but it doesn't begin romantically. It begins as business, turns to friendship, and then into love. James Bond in love? Sad, but true. I guess the point of this relationship is to illustrate why Bond never settles down and became a playboy and womanizer. Throw in a bit of Aston Martin driving scenes, some torture, and a couple of betrayals to make things complete.Overall, CASINO ROYALE turned out to be what I expected: a great action movie, a good spy film, and just a decent James Bond picture. Craig is better in the role than I expected him to be. He's a good actor and even though he is the &#34;new, re-imagined&#34; James Bond, he does a good job of staying true to the legacy bestowed to him while making it fresh and new. Eva Green is full of a feminine mystique that many Bond girls in the past have lacked. Her character, Vesper Lynd, isn't just beautiful and brainy; she's also independent, compassionate, and wise. Unlike the models and actresses who have played Bond girls before, Lynd comes off as being more of a girl-next-door than a supermodel. Judi Dench returns to her role as M and like many of the films she acts in, she steals every scene she is in. Mads Mikkelsen has played several oddballs and freaks in his career and fits well into the role of the eerie and sinister Le Chiffre. Finally, Jeffery Wright isn't on screen much, but he's great as Bond's American CIA counterpart Felix Leiter.Despite dragging in several parts, CASINO ROYALE has a lot of action. There's not quite as much as one would expect from a Bond picture, but this isn't a typical Bond picture. Also missing from the picture are any gadgets and the presence of inventor extraordinaire, Q. There are no gadgets in this movie.Overall, I enjoyed CASINO ROYALE. It felt very much like a typical American spy-thriller, which is what I found most interesting about the picture. As I mentioned before, Bond is a very British character, but in CASINO ROYALE he comes off as being more like a typical American anti-hero. The filmmakers set out to re-vamp the James Bond franchise. They have succeeded. I just hope that in the next film Bond gets back to his British roots.",4,"It's Bond, James Bond, But American Style",1166140800,"12 15, 2006",2006,6085,"['admit', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'sure',

1048783,A2DLVJVYAVG37U,B000MNP2K8,Up The Stairs,"[6, 11]","I had much anticipation for this film.  Having grown up with Sean Connery playing James Bond, and having read all of the books several times as a teenager, I've always felt that I had a good pulse for what makes a great Bond movie.  Somewhere along the line, the Bond films became a comic book, a farce, and never more so than when Roger Moore was playing Bond.  Some improvement was made with Timothy Dalton in the starring role, he put some shock and awe into the role, but we regressed again with Pierce Brosnan.  Not that it was Brosnan's fault, indeed, it was the producers who seemed to have lost sight of what made Bond truly memorable.Enter Daniel Craig.  After watching Casino Royale, I felt I had seen the best Bond movie since Thunderball.  Bond was back, he was gritty, tough, no nonsense, and not a stupid parody of himself.  But why?  I believe it has to do with Jason Bourne.  Jason Bourne movies gave us everything Bond movies used to give us, without the silly, stupid, tiresome routines, and the predictable, inane special effects.  Bourne fims are just straight ahead action-spy movies.  The Bond people saw in the Jason Bourne films a rival, somebody that could actually supplant Bond as the favorite spy hero.  Suddenly, there was a reason to mess with the formula and do something necessary.  Casino Royale is just that; something necessary.  Not only that, however.  Bond is reborn.  ""Rebooted"" is the term I've heard most often, and I agree.  We get a new Bond, a Bond that is not only of the new generation, but a Bond that is ruthless and willing to kill when a better option might be available.  Those of us who have read Casino Royale know that this Bond movie follows the basic plot of the novel better than any Bond movie in thirty years (and it is the first novel, hence a great place to re-boot Bond).  While the first 45 minutes of the movie have nothing to do with the novel, it serves as a basis for the new Bond and an avenue to sign off from the old.  Then the novel's basic plot takes hold and we ride it out.  I've read complaints about the card game taking too long; I say bullocks to that.  The card game in the novel is much of the plot, takes a good long while, and is very suspenseful.  From the point of the card game to the recuperation and discovery of being double crossed by Vesper, the movie is a creative version of the novel's plot.  The last few minutes in Venice deviate, but that's okay, as it works.And thank the Bond Lord for the best reason to like this movie.  We don't get all of those silly scenes that are in EVERY Bond movie since Goldfinger.  Q was great in Goldfinger and Thunderball, but the redundancy of seeing the comical Q in every film became tired and flat.  Speaking of redundancey, it is possible to take any scene from any post-Thunderball Bond movie and insert it in any other post-Thunderball Bond movie and you'd never know the difference.  Another great thing about this movie is the lack of stupid characters.  Remember the fat County Sheriff that appeared in 2-3 of the Roger Moore films, serving as the basis to install stupid characters in following Bond movies?  We don't have any dumb, fat, Southern sheriffs in this movie.  Thank the Bond Lord for that!  Also, I am a huge fan of Sean Connery and his development of Bond's character.  One of Connery's innovations to the Bond character was the tongue in cheek humor.  Those subtle comments Bond would drop when something happened were originally coined by Connery to the producer's and director's delight.  They became a staple of Bond movies, but by the time Pierce Brosnan took the role, they became the plot.  I can remember watching all of the Brosnan Bond films and waiting for Bond to say a sentence that wasn't some corny, stupid comment on the state of a scene.  Bond had become a parody of himself.  Those comments are held to a minimum in Casino Royale, much to the benefit of the plot and the overall story.This is a Bond movie worth watching over and over (I've watched it three times, and I've had it only a week), and owning the DVD will allow you to do just that.  I highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys James Bond, spy movies, action films, adventure films.  You get to travel the world, watch beautiful women, handsome men, daring do, and visit with an old friend.  What could be next for Bond?  I can only hope they will re-make all of Roger Moore's Bond films. I'd even be up for a re-make of On Her Majesty's Secret Service, as George Lazenby just didn't cut it.  The Brosnan and Dalton films are not original stories, so they can do whatever they want with them, but I see no need for re-makes.As I stand at the podium, I'd like to thank, not my mother or my dad, but Jason Bourne for giving the producers of the Bond films some incentive to put Bond back on track.",5,Finally A Bond movie without the cliches,1174780800,"03 25, 2007",2007,4833,"['had', 'much',

1048786,A35L2E8M7S59MQ,B000MNP2K8,V. Berk,"[2, 2]","Casino Royale is a Bond film that finally manages to pull of the ""real"" style correctly.  There have been admirable efforts such as On Her Majesty's Secret Service, and the Timothy Dalton films, but none have quite pulled it off right.  This is the 21st film in the ""never-ending"" franchise and also introduces us to our sixth actor to play Bond and the first to be based directly on Ian Fleming's initial novel, Casino Royale (excluding the 60s comedy film).Martin Campbell, who also directed one of my favorite 007 adventures in 1995, GoldenEye, returns to the director's chair to introduce us to yet another Bond-actor.  This is the most real James Bond to date and is very believable portrayal filled with some of the best camera work you'll ever witness.  It comes across as real, but it also keep to classic Bond roots by including cars, beautiful women, and even some more realistic gadgets, such as a tracking device inserted within his vein and a few others kept handy within the glove box of his Aston Martin.  He may not wield a laser wristwatch, but he gets the job done.The action sequences in this film are perhaps the most intense to be put into any Bond film and shall keep you on the edge of your seat, because this may be the one film where you actually feel like James Bond is in danger.  All previous films you knew that ""Hey, this is James Bond.  He'll make it.""  This one you can still think that while watching, but you certainly worry more for the title character than you have in the previous entries.Daniel Craig does well as the title character, and is very believable as a young James Bond starting his career.  He walks as if he has a chip on his shoulder and you can tell this is the angriest Bond to date.  He has yet to transform into the coolheaded Bond seen in Connery, Moore, and Brosnan, and he shows it in every way.  This Bond hasn't even grown accustomed to wearing a suit!  But he is however a good gambler and enjoys himself some cocktails.Judi Dench returns as M, the head of MI6.  Dench who first took the role (being the first woman in the role) in the Brosnan film GoldenEye has always played a good character, but this time around she comes across as being a different type of M.  This time she seems more like a worried-parent character, who treats Bond as though he is a child, because she knows he is not the Bond of legend at this point, and he needs guidance or he shall never turn into the coolheaded super agent that we all know and love.This is one of the best entries in the James Bond franchise, there is no denying that, but I do worry of how the Craig run will end.  After Campbell left Brosnan he got pulled down by scripts that relied too heavily one gadgets and comic one-liners, and now I fear that Craig may end up being weighed down from becoming overly serious (see: Quantum of Solace).  We must remember that Bond is a basically a comic-book type hero who is basically a superhero who wears a suit instead of a costume.Regardless of whether or not Craig's run ends on a good or bad note Casino Royale shall easily remain one of the best James Bond films ever made.  Campbell should stop running off and stick to Bond, because it seems things start to go badly when he leaves his Bond actor in the hands of the sponsors.",5,"Finally a well done ""real"" Bond film",1238457600,"03 31, 2009",2009,3285,"['Casino', 'Royale', 'Bond', 'film', 'finally', 'pull', 'real', 'style', 'correctly', 'have', 'been', 'admirable', 'efforts', 'such', 'Her', 'Majesty', 'Secret', 'Service', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'films', 'none', 'have', 'quite', 'pulled', 'off', 'right', '21st', 'film', 'never-ending', 'franchise', 'also', 'sixth', 'actor', 'play', 'Bond', 'first', 'be', 'based', 'directly', 'Ian', 'Fleming', 'initial', 'novel', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'excluding', '60s', 'comedy', 'film', '.Martin', 'Campbell', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'one', 'favorite', '007', 'adventures', '1995', 'GoldenEye', 'director', 'chair', 'introduce', 'yet', 'Bond-actor', 'most', 'real', 'James', 'Bond', 'date', 'very', 'believable', 'portrayal', 'filled', 'best', 'camera', 'work', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'witness', 'real', 'also', 'keep', 'classic', 'Bond', 'roots', 'including', 'cars', 'beautiful', 'women', 'even', 'more', 'realistic', 'gadgets', 'such', 'tracking', 'device', 'inserted', 'vein', 'few', 'others', 'kept', 'handy', 'glove', 'box', 'Aston', 'Martin', 'may', 'not', 'wield', 'laser', 'wristwatch', 'job', 'done.The', 'action', 'sequences', 'film', 'are', 'perhaps', 'most', 'intense', 'be', 'put', 'Bond', 'film', 'shall', 'keep', 'edge', 'seat', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'film', 'where', 'actually', 'feel', 'James', 'Bond', 'danger', 'previous', 'films', 'knew', 'Hey', 'James', 'Bond', ""'ll"", 'make', 'one', 'can', 'still', 'think', 'watching', 'certainly', 'worry', 'more', 'title', 'character', 'have', 'previous', 'entries.Daniel', 'Craig', 'well', 'title', 'character', 'very', 'believable', 'young', 'James', 'Bond', 'starting', 'career', 'chip', 'shoulder', 'can', 'tell', 'angriest', 'Bond', 'date', 'yet', 'transform', 'coolheaded', 'Bond', 'seen', 'Connery', 'Moore', 'Brosnan', 'way', 'Bond', ""n't"", 'even', 'grown', 'accustomed', 'wearing', 'suit', 'however', 'good', 'gambler', 'cocktails.Judi', 'Dench', 'returns', 'M', 'head', 'MI6', 'Dench', 'who', 'first', 'took', 'role', 'being', 'first', 'woman', 'role', 'Brosnan', 'film', 'GoldenEye', 'always', 'played', 'good', 'character', 'time', 'across', 'being', 'different', 'type', 'M.', 'time', 'more', 'worried-parent', 'character', 'who', 'Bond', 'child', 'not', 'Bond', 'legend', 'point', 'guidance', 'shall', 'never', 'turn', 'coolheaded', 'super', 'agent', 'know', 'love.This', 'one', 'best', 'entries', 'James', 'Bond', 'franchise', 'denying', 'do', 'worry', 'how', 'Craig', 'run', 'will', 'end', 'Campbell', 'left', 'Brosnan', 'got', 'pulled', 'down', 'scripts', 'relied', 'too', 'heavily', 'one', 'gadgets', 'comic', 'one-liners', 'now', 'fear', 'Craig', 'may', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'weighed', 'down', 'becoming', 'overly', 'serious', 'see', 'Quantum', 'Solace', 'must', 'remember', 'Bond', 'basically', 'comic-book', 'type', 'hero', 'who', 'basically', 'superhero', 'who', 'suit', 'instead', 'costume.Regardless', 'not', 'Craig', 'run', 'good', 'bad', 'note', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'shall', 'easily', 'remain', 'one', 'best', 'James', 'Bond', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'Campbell', 'should', 'stop', 'running', 'off', 'stick', 'Bond', 'things', 'start', 'go', 'badly', 'when', 'Bond', 'actor', 'hands', 'sponsors']",N/A

If you were one of those that wrote off the Bond franchise as old or out of touch, then check out Casino Royale.  It basically restarts the franchise, wiping clean the slate and ignoring every Bond film that came before it.  Which is fine, because, let's face it, if all the Bond films were indeed sequels, Bond would be in his 70s.  And although I though Pierce was an excellent Bond, he's not that old.  The character is very much like The Simpsons, he never ages, even though the world around him does.So, Casino Royale reintroduces how Bond became 007, and the movie rocks.  My only problem with Daniel Craig is that he doesn't have the sophisticated English gentleman trait, who is just as smooth with the ladies as he is with his liquor.  This Bond is gritty, from the streets.  As everyone who's read the Amazon review knows, when asked how he likes his martini, he replies ""do I look like I give a damn?""  Now, the Bond we all know and love would never say that.  In Diamonds are Forever, Bond even knew the vintage of the whiskey that the Sherry he was drinking was based on.  That's class.  This Bond wouldn't know nor care about that...YET.  I get the sense that this film will set up the next film, in which many of the traits that are missing will slowly appear.

Just the trailer grabbed me with the hints at a masterful plot, a darker, fresher and more creative Bond who didn't rely on all his fancy (and coincidental) gadgets. I watched this movie coming over on a flight back from England, and I was blown away. Daniel Craig portrays a very somber, dedicated ""00"", whose trademark is not his witty comebacks or his cool gadgets, or even his gun, but his ingenuity, his skill and his sheer fury, which he only lets loose when the situation calls for it. Its like watching a tornado from afar. You are amazed, but terribly afraid to come any closer.The ending (which I will not reveal) was a little...out of place for me, specifically one line, right after he says ""The Job's done."" There, that didn't reveal anything for those who haven't seen it, but people who have know what I'm talking about. I found it a little...out of place and disconcerting. I understand why it's there, but I wish it had been done a bit differently.Other than that, I found this movie pretty much flawless. It really brings Bond back to his roots in Ian Flemming's world. The terrific action is coupled with a magnificent plot that keeps twisting and turning, and is very realistic, and quite unlike any other Bond plot. I enjoy the classic Sean Connery films, but when you watch this, you realize that its an entirely new ball park. In many ways, the old style of Bond films is completely different from Casino Royale, because it breaks so many of the traditions of a Bond film.And that is partially why its such a good film, because you've come to expect something out of a Bond film, and this is something so new and totally different, it just blows you away.Five Stars!",5,"A darker, more imaginative James Bond...",1177372800,"04 24, 2007",2007,1798,"['day', 'first', 'saw', 'trailer', 'movie', 'knew', 'was', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'other', 'Bond', 'movie', 'Just', 'trailer', 'grabbed', 'hints', 'masterful', 'plot', 'darker', 'fresher', 'more', 'creative', 'Bond', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'rely', 'fancy', 'coincidental', 'gadgets', 'watched', 'movie', 'coming', 'over', 'flight', 'back', 'England', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'very', 'somber', 'dedicated', '00', 'trademark', 'not', 'witty', 'comebacks', 'cool', 'gadgets', 'even', 'gun', 'ingenuity', 'skill', 'sheer', 'fury', 'only', 'loose', 'when', 'situation', 'watching', 'tornado', 'afar', 'are', 'amazed', 'terribly', 'afraid', 'come', 'closer.The', 'ending', 'will', 'not', 'reveal', 'was', 'little', 'place', 'specifically', 'one', 'line', 'right', 'Job', 'done', 'did', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'anything', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'know', 'what', ""'m"", 'talking', 'found', 'little', 'place', 'disconcerting', 'understand', 'why', 'there', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'done', 'bit', 'differently.Other', 'found', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'flawless', 'really', 'Bond', 'back', 'roots', 'Ian', 'Flemming', 'world', 'terrific', 'action', 'coupled', 'magnificent', 'plot', 'twisting', 'turning', 'very', 'realistic', 'quite', 'other', 'Bond', 'plot', 'enjoy', 'classic', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'films', 'when', 'watch', 'realize', 'entirely', 'new', 'ball', 'park', 'many', 'ways', 'old', 'style', 'Bond', 'films', 'completely', 'different', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'so', 'many', 'traditions', 'Bond', 'film.And', 'partially', 'why', 'such', 'good', 'film', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'something', 'Bond', 'film', 'something', 'so', 'new', 'totally', 'different', 'just', 'away.Five', 'Stars']",N/A

But what's really happened is that 007 has been grafted onto ""Die Hard."" If we really want to revivify James Bond, the challenge isn't finding the right actor -- Roger, Timothy, Pierce, Daniel -- all of them are perfectly fine. The challenge is in the formula. Why make 007 into the typical action movie, where the chase is less a chase than a physical combat?The James Bond that the early films taught me to love was the suave hero who could vault the perimeter of an embassy and still emerge perfectly dressed for a black-tie evening, complete with the red rose in his lapel. His arrogance had to do with his intellect and his physical charm not his overbearing presence. He doesn't need to be able to leap from a toppling building or construction site; half the film needn't be devoted to the stunt men. The point of James is that he is professional; he makes do with the least amount of effort. Bond: You should never see him sweat.I think it's in the film ""Thunderball,"" 007 enters his hotel room, checks the audiorecording he has made (this is HIGH TECH in 1965), and realizes based on the echo of the steps that an enemy is hiding in his shower. He proceeds into the shower area, knocks the guy out, and leaning over gently pops his gun out of his hand, by hitting just this precise spot on the back of the wrist that causes the gun to drop. No effort even slightly over what is required to achieve the result he desires.  As the intruder runs out of the room he shouts to James, ""Aren't you going to kill me?"" James's answer is to this effect: I'm a professional, I kill when I have to; and I don't kill the small fish if I don't need to.When we are able to re-imagine this sort of hero, who is interesting to the extent that he is complex and not just a burly strong guy, then the makers of the James Bond films will be able to find their new James. In other words, all these choices to replace Sean Connery have been fine; it's the concept that remains lacking.The new M, in contrast, she is the absolute bomb.",2,"Craig, Brosnan, Dalton all great; the problem is the concept",1219622400,"08 25, 2008",2008,2152,"['other', 'reviewers', 'here', 'mostly', 'seem', 'applaud', 'new', 'buff', 'hard-core', 'Bond', 'shaken', 'not', 'stirred', ""n't"", 'seem', 'care', 'what', 'really', 'happened', '007', 'been', 'grafted', 'Die', 'Hard', 'really', 'want', 'revivify', 'James', 'Bond', 'challenge', ""n't"", 'finding', 'right', 'actor', 'Roger', 'Timothy', 'Pierce', 'Daniel', 'are', 'perfectly', 'fine', 'challenge', 'formula', 'Why', 'make', '007', 'typical', 'action', 'movie', 'where', 'chase', 'less', 'chase', 'physical', 'combat', 'James', 'Bond', 'early', 'films', 'taught', 'love', 'was', 'suave', 'hero', 'who', 'could', 'vault', 'perimeter', 'embassy', 'still', 'emerge', 'perfectly', 'dressed', 'black-tie', 'evening', 'complete', 'red', 'rose', 'lapel', 'arrogance', 'had', 'do', 'intellect', 'physical', 'charm', 'not', 'overbearing', 'presence', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'able', 'leap', 'toppling', 'building', 'construction', 'site', 'film', 'need', ""n't"", 'be', 'devoted', 'stunt', 'men', 'point', 'James', 'professional', 'do', 'least', 'amount', 'effort', 'Bond', 'should', 'never', 'see', 'sweat.I', 'think', 'film', 'Thunderball', '007', 'enters', 'hotel', 'room', 'audiorecording', 'made', 'HIGH', 'TECH', '1965', 'realizes', 'based', 'echo', 'steps', 'enemy', 'hiding', 'shower', 'shower', 'area', 'guy', 'leaning', 'over', 'gently', 'gun', 'hand', 'hitting', 'just', 'precise', 'spot', 'back', 'wrist', 'gun', 'drop', 'effort', 'even', 'slightly', 'what', 'required', 'achieve', 'result', 'intruder', 'room', 'James', 'Are', ""n't"", 'going', 'kill', 'James', 'answer', 'effect', ""'m"", 'professional', 'kill', 'when', 'have', 'do', ""n't"", 'kill', 'small', 'fish', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'are', 'able', 're-imagine', 'sort', 'hero', 'who', 'interesting', 'extent', 'complex', 'not', 'just', 'burly', 'strong', 'guy', 'then', 'makers', 'James', 'Bond', 'films', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'find', 'new', 'James', 'other', 'words', 'choices', 'replace', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'have', 'been', 'fine', 'concept', 'lacking.The', 'new', 'M', 'contrast', 'absolute', 'bomb']",N/A
1048793,A3KXV8AFQ550DY,B000MNP2K8,Wayne C. Rogers,"[4, 8]","I hate to admit it but I was one of the many people who were against Daniel Craig playing James Bond in Casino Royale.  I was still upset with how Pierce Brosnan had been treated by the producers of the ""Bond"" series, plus I felt if anyone could take Brosnan's place, it was Clive Owen.  I'd seen Daniel Craig in The Road to Perdition, Laura Croft: Tomb Raider and Munich, but I just couldn't picture him as 007.  I'm happy to report, however, that he completely won me over with his realistic portrayal of James Bond in Casino Royale.  Though I won't say that Craig is better than Sean Connery (after all I grew up with Sean Connery playing Bond back in the early sixties), I will say that he runs a close second place with Pierce Brosnan.  Certainly Craig has the best physical body of anyone to play this character, and the fight and action scenes are hard, fast, and utterly breathtaking.  I expect and look forward to seeing Craig in the next two-or-three ""Bond"" movies.As everyone knows by now, Bond gets his ""00"" status at the beginning of Casino Royale after making two kills.  He's then assigned to capture a terrorist bomber in the hopes of learning who the man's boss is.  This leads to one of the most exciting action sequences in ""Bond"" history, not to mention the public's first look at the art of ""free running,"" which is astounding to behold.  Later, when back in England, a disgruntled ""M"" puts her new ""00"" agent on a leave of absence, warning him that he basically needs to get his act together, or else.  Bond takes it upon himself to track down the boss of the terrorist bomber, and this eventually leads him to Le Chiffre, the financier for the world's leading terrorist organization that's led by a man known only as Mr. White.  Bond and Le Chiffre will go head to head in a battle of skill and wits during a high stakes Texas Hold'em game.  We're talking about a game where the winner will take home over a hundred million dollars.  During all of this, Bond will have to battle a couple of angry Africans with a rather big machete, survive a poisoning attempt, and more importantly grow to love the woman who's been assigned to work with him, Vesper Lynd.  Before the end of the movie is reached, however, Bond will learn what real pain is while being tortured and then again through a terrible act of betrayal.  As ""M"" later tells him, learn to trust no one.Casino Royale was definitely one of the best movies of 2006, and Daniel Craig pretty much won the hearts of most of the ""Bond"" fans, including myself.  Though there were a few things about the film that I didn't understand (why was Judi Dench chosen to play ""M"" at the beginning of Bond's career when she didn't actually come into the picture till his later years and why have him win the Aston Martin DB-5 in a poker game, when the car was actually provided for him by MI-6's Q Branch back in Goldfinger?), it doesn't take away from the sheer fun of watching the movie.  Eva Green is just as lovely as Vesper Lynd as she was in The Kingdom of Heaven, and Giancarlo Giannini was the ideal choice to play Mathis.  I've never heard of Mads Mikkelsen, but he was also perfect as the villain, Le Chiffre.  All in all, Casino Royale is a fantastic addition to the ""Bond"" franchise.  It's certainly a film that you'll want to watch over and over again.  The two-disc DVD edition includes three featurettes: Becoming Bond, which runs around twenty-five minutes in length and has an interview with Craig about the challenges he faced in taking on the role, James Bond: For Real, which is also about twenty-five minutes long and goes into the making of the movie and how some of the stunts were done, and Bond Girls Are Forever, which was about fifty minutes in length and deals with many of the lovely ladies who have appeared in the ""Bond"" movies since Dr. No.  This was quite enjoyable to watch and had interviews with Ursula Andreas, Honor Blackman, Jill St. John, and a score of others.  Last on the DVD is a music video of Chris Cornell singing the theme song to Casino Royale.  I wasn't overly impressed with the song, though the rest of the music works well with the film.  If you're a ""Bond"" fan, then Casino Royale is a must for your movie library.  I've already watched the DVD twice since getting it in the mail a few days ago.  Needless to say, this movie is Highly Recommended.",5,James Bond is back in action!!!,1174176000,"03 18, 2007",2007,4365,"['hate', 'admit', 'was', 'one', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'playing', 'James', 'Bond', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'was', 'still', 'upset', 'how', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'had', 'been', 'treated', 'producers', 'Bond', 'series', 'felt', 'anyone', 'could', 'take', 'Brosnan', 'place', 'was', 'Clive', 'Owen', ""'d"", 'seen', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'Road', 'Perdition', 'Laura', 'Croft', 'Tomb', 'Raider', 'Munich', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'picture', '007', ""'m"", 'happy', 'report', 'however', 'completely', 'won', 'over', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'James', 'Bond', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'Craig', 'better', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'grew', 'up', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'playing', 'Bond', 'back', 'early', 'sixties', 'will', 'say', 'close', 'second', 'place', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'Certainly', 'Craig', 'best', 'physical', 'body', 'anyone', 'play', 'character', 'fight', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'hard', 'fast', 'utterly', 'breathtaking', 'expect', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'Craig', 'next', 'two-or-three', 'Bond', 'movies.As', 'everyone', 'now', 'Bond', '00', 'status', 'beginning', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'making', 'two', 'kills', 'then', 'assigned', 'capture', 'terrorist', 'bomber', 'hopes', 'learning', 'who', 'man', 'boss', 'one', 'most', 'exciting', 'action', 'sequences', 'Bond', 'history', 'not', 'mention', 'public', 'first', 'look', 'art', 'free', 'running', 'astounding', 'behold', 'Later', 'when', 'back', 'England', 'disgruntled', 'M', 'new', '00', 'agent', 'leave', 'absence', 'warning', 'basically', 'get', 'act', 'together', 'else', 'Bond', 'track', 'down', 'boss', 'terrorist', 'bomber', 'eventually', 'Le', 'Chiffre', 'financier', 'world', 'leading', 'terrorist', 'organization', 'led', 'man', 'known', 'only', 'Mr.', 'White', 'Bond', 'Le', 'Chiffre', 'will', 'go', 'head', 'head', 'battle', 'skill', 'wits', 'high', 'stakes', 'Texas', ""Hold'em"", 'game', ""'re"", 'talking', 'game', 'where', 'winner', 'will', 'take', 'home', 'hundred', 'million', 'dollars', 'Bond', 'will', 'have', 'battle', 'couple', 'angry', 'Africans', 'rather', 'big', 'machete', 'survive', 'poisoning', 'attempt', 'more', 'importantly', 'grow', 'love', 'woman', 'who', 'been', 'assigned', 'work', 'Vesper', 'Lynd', 'end', 'movie', 'reached', 'however', 'Bond', 'will', 'learn', 'what', 'real', 'pain', 'being', 'tortured', 'then', 'again', 'terrible', 'act', 'betrayal', 'M', 'later', 'learn', 'trust', 'one.Casino', 'Royale', 'was', 'definitely', 'one', 'best', 'movies', '2006', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'pretty', 'much', 'won', 'hearts', 'most', 'Bond', 'fans', 'including', 'were', 'few', 'things', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'was', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'chosen', 'play', 'M', 'beginning', 'Bond', 'career', 'when', 'did', ""n't"", 'actually', 'come', 'picture', 'till', 'later', 'years', 'why', 'have', 'win', 'Aston', 'Martin', 'DB-5', 'poker', 'game', 'when', 'car', 'was', 'actually', 'provided', 'MI-6', 'Q', 'Branch', 'back', 'Goldfinger', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'sheer', 'fun', 'watching', 'movie', 'Eva', 'Green', 'just', 'as', 'lovely', 'Vesper', 'Lynd', 'was', 'Kingdom', 'Heaven', 'Giancarlo', 'Giannini', 'was', 'ideal', 'choice', 'play', 'Mathis', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'Mads', 'Mikkelsen', 'was', 'also', 'perfect', 'villain', 'Le', 'Chiffre', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'fantastic', 'addition', 'Bond', 'franchise', 'certainly', 'film', ""'ll"", 'want', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'two-disc', 'DVD', 'edition', 'three', 'featurettes', 'Becoming', 'Bond', 'twenty-five', 'minutes', 'length', 'interview', 'Craig', 'challenges', 'faced', 'taking', 'role', 'James', 'Bond', 'Real', 'also', 'twenty-five', 'minutes', 'long', 'making', 'movie', 'how', 'stunts', 'were', 'done', 'Bond', 'Girls', 'Are', 'Forever', 'was', 'fifty', 'minutes', 'length', 'deals', 'many', 'lovely', 'ladies', 'who', 'have', 'appeared', 'Bond', 'movies', 'Dr.', 'No', 'was', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'had', 'interviews', 'Ursula', 'Andreas', 'Honor', 'Blackman', 'Jill', 'St.', 'John', 'score', 'others', 'Last', 'DVD', 'music', 'video', 'Chris', 'Cornell', 'singing', 'theme', 'song', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'was', ""n't"", 'overly', 'impressed', 'song', 'rest', 'music', 'well', 'film', ""'re"", 'Bond', 'fan', 'then', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'must', 'movie', 'library', ""'ve"", 'already', 'watched', 'DVD', 'twice', 'getting', 'mail', 'few', 'days', 'ago', 'Needless', 'say', 'movie', 'Highly', 'Recommended']",N/A

With its visual references (and one characters witty tip of the hat to ""Reservoir Dogs"") to any number of Quentin Tarrantino's action/dramas this revisionist approach to Bond (most notable during the opening fight sequence and a torture sequence involving Bond)suits the film, the times and, more importantly, actor Daniel Craig. Craig embodies the best elements of what came before (the ruthlessness of Sean Connery and Pierce Brosnan and some of the corny quips of Roger Moore with the pathos of George Lazenby thrown in for good measure). Craig may not be the best Bond (that'll be open to debate for years) but he embodies THIS Bond giving a terrific steely eyed performance with just a hint of Bond's lost humanity. It's petty brave that actor Daniel Craig is willing to reference the past performances of other actors playing Bond while finding his own niche to play the role from.***Spoilers Below!Bond (Craig) recently promoted to a 00 operative tries to track and trap a terrorist using the stock market to increase his personal wealth at the cost of human lives. When one of Bond's other agents blows an undercover assignment Bond must track and capture his only lead through the streets of Madagascar in a brilliantly choreographed and photographed set piece. It's an explosive opening for the film and despite the film's excessive running time and a plot that threatens to go slack in the middle of the film ""Casino Royale"" manages to succeed where some previous Bond films have gone off the track.***End of Spoilers!Bond films live and die by their tone and their action sequences. This third adaptation of ""Casino Royale"" (Bond purists know that the novel was first adapted for American television with American actor Barry Nelson playing Jimmy Bond). Director Martin Campell (""The Mask of Zorro"", ""Goldeneye"", ""Beyond Borders"") creates a stunning series of set pieces that rival those seen in a Jerry Bruckheimer film but that work within the dark confines of the Bond universe. Make no mistake this is a dark Bond film where everyone plays in shades of gray rather than in the harsh glare of black or white. The result is a richer, more ambitious Bond than we've seen in years.Rebooting the franchise by visiting how Bond became Bond is a brilliant notion. The screenplay by Neal Purvis  (""Die Another Day"", ""The World is Not Enough""),  Robert Wade (""Die Another Day"", ""The World is Not Enough) and Paul Haggis (""Crash"", ""Flags of Our Fathers"", ""Million Dollar Baby"") may occasionally became entangled in its own convoluted plot but the resort is refreshingly fascinating, fun and a nice step away from the comic book plots that characterized the 70's Bond films and threatened to pollute even the Brosnan brand of Bond.Although it might run a tad too long with its extended code ""Casino Royale"" finally reimagines the franchise (remember how ""The Living Daylights"" was supposed to do exactly that but failed despite some nice action sequences)in a way to make it relevant to audiences for the 21st century. There's been much debate about Craig in the role but based on his performances in ""Munich"" and ""Layer Cake"" I had no doubt that he could do a terrific job and make the role very much his own. I'd also like to point out to those who complained that fans have complained about everybody cast in the role except Pierce Brosnan since Sean Connery gave up the ghost the first time with ""Diamonds Are Forever"".

I still think the chase scene at the beginning is silly, but fun; but the rest of the film really engaged me.  I believe the producers have made a very wise choice in both Daniel Craig, and how Bond is updated.  The old bond seems as dated as watching the original Rat Pack in some of their films--- fun, and certainly reflective of the time, but very dated.  I'm actually looking forward to picking up the story in the next outing!Even if you're less than enthusiastic about the Bond franchise, give this one a shot.",5,Second time was the charm!,1208476800,"04 18, 2008",2008,821,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'most', 'recently', 'released', 'Bond', 'felt', 'first', 'third', 'was', 'silly', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'was', 'adequate', 'roll', 'overall', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'action', 'movie', 'whim', 'great', 'price', 'decided', 'buy', 'DVD', 'was', 'astounded', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'still', 'think', 'chase', 'scene', 'beginning', 'silly', 'fun', 'rest', 'film', 'really', 'engaged', 'believe', 'producers', 'have', 'made', 'very', 'wise', 'choice', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'how', 'Bond', 'updated', 'old', 'bond', 'as', 'dated', 'watching', 'original', 'Rat', 'Pack', 'films', 'fun', 'certainly', 'reflective', 'time', 'very', 'dated', ""'m"", 'actually', 'looking', 'forward', 'picking', 'up', 'story', 'next', 'outing', 'Even', ""'re"", 'less', 'enthusiastic', 'Bond', 'franchise', 'give', 'one', 'shot']",N/A
1048799,A1DORQXHAAR8J9,B000MNP2K8,"William H. Kelsey ""seeker of truth""","[0, 1]","What this film comes down to, in terms of whether it will appeal to you or not, is the simple question of which type of spy you prefer: classic Bond (Sean Connery, Moore) or that of Jason Bourne. Personally, I hated the classic Bond films with their portrayal of a spy who can supposedly save the earth but is so flabby and out of shape (not to mention has a drinking problem and smokes too much). I also detested the unbelievable villians and the chicks with genital names. Austin Powers really nailed exactly what the classic Bond films presented as our superspy and how silly it is that anyone would rely on this man.Now, what about the new Bond? He looks pumped and conditioned, as one would imagine a superspy would be. He is cold and brutal, but with an emotional depth hidden right beneath the surface. Craig is amazing and delivers a fantastic performance (and don't bring up the hair. It's not as if the man were as blond as Flash Gordon, not the hair colour should matter).The film itself is very fast paced and much more realistic than the early Bond films, with the villians' goals being global terrorism and destabilization of the markets. While not as flashy as taking over the world with a giant laser, it is much more believable. I understand that the early Bonds were closer to the author's original vision, but sometimes, very rarely, scripts are better than the material on which they are based. This is one of those times. To end, if you love the classic Bonds, you most likely will hate this. However, if you under 50 like me and loved the fast pace, kicking major derriere of the Bourne films, you will absolutely love this. Do you want a killer spy or do you want a cheesy pick up artist?

1048801,A1JJK67VXR1WSR,B000MNP2K8,William R. Hancock,"[3, 7]","Having been one of those people who had strong reservations about the choice of Daniel Craig as James Bond number 6, I have to say I was blown away with surprise at how good he actually turned out to be in the role.He is charismatic, has a strong, dominating ""camera presence"", is very athletic and believable in fight scenes (unlike Roger Moore and more like George Lazenby), can project intense ruthlessness through demeanor and eye work (watchfulness as well ; he constantly looks as though he is scanning rooms, doorways, and personages for any signs of access, egress, or danger...something any real field operative would automatically do).All in all Mr. Craig lays down a solid James Bond characterization that almost seems like Sean Connery channeled through Steve McQueen (although that would seem a paranormally strange proposition).Connery, the template and yardstick for all Bond performances, is still ""Numero Uno"", and always will be (you have to expect that, because in defining the character in the earliest films, not only Saltzman, Broccoli, and Terence Young were shaping the product and the performance, but so was Ian Fleming, who was still alive then and contributing input on the stories and the character portrayals...you will find plenty of photos of Fleming conversing with Connery, giving him pointers). Daniel Craig, however, turns in such a tremendous performance here in ""Casino Royale"" that he almost has to be ranked...HAS to be....absolutely the second best 007 ever....and a close second, at that.The screenplay here is very close to the novel as well. This film, as does ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" , really does tell an Ian Fleming story. The updating to the ""mysterious international terrorist organization"" (which everyone on the planet seems to want to be SPECTRE)is a good, logical, functional update to the old Cold War threats of the KGB and SMERSH.Some ""reboot"" elements are annoying here and there, though. And dishonest. The producers claim that they went back to the first 007 novel to do a ""Batman Begins"" type revelation of ""How Bond Became Bond"". No such storyline exists in the novel ""Casino Royale"". James Bond isn't any just-won-his-wings ""newbie"" in ""Casino Royale""...he's a VETERAN double-O agent who (as of 1953, when the book is published) has been 007 for close on to a decade (beginning with his sniper killings of Japanese operatives in NYC during WWII). This is established quite plainly. So the ""newbie"" thing here is a deceit. The acquisition of the DB5 Aston Martin jars as well, as this is a car introduced in a FAMOUS scene in ""Goldfinger"" (the ""I never joke about my work, 007"" sequence between Bond and Q). Before he got the Aston, Bond drove a convertible Bentley. Now, in some sort of strange alternate reality, he has gotten the DB5 (less the Q branch ""alterations"") BEFORE he ever got it. A bit of a head-shaker, that.It is also intensely weird to see Bond as a brand-new 007, working for an ""M"" (Judi Dench) that took over that position in Pierce Brosnan's ""Goldeneye"", when the Brosnan Bond is already a 00 of long, long standing. There is NO series continuity with this move. Again, we seem off in an alternate dimension here...a galaxy far, far away.We also have to deal with this strange notion EON productions seems to have about alternate realities when we try to process who it is Bond works for. It is acknowledged over time in the series that he works for M.I.6 (British foreign intelligence and counterintelligence). But what IS ""M.I.6""? It is a COVER designation (Military Intelligence, Section 6) for the British Secret Intelligence Service (aka S.I.S.), and since the 1960s on, that fact has become more and more available to the public. Anyone can Google the web and instantly discover that S.I.S. and ""M.I.6"" are the same thing. Its no secret and isn't remotely difficult to discover. Yet, for some strange reason,EON wants MI6 to be something called the ""Military Intelligence & Security Service""...which it isn't. Why? Your guess is as good as mine.All these weirdnesses aside, ""CR"" is one entertaining movie (007 or otherwise). It has hard-charging action, absolutely wonderful stunts (particularly in an opening chase sequence and , later on, a superb airport multi-vehicle pursuit and wreck-a-thon), crackling dialog, first rate photography and editing, great sound and sound effects, out-of-sight and totally believable special effects, great acting all around AND great direction. AND the infamous and legendary bottomless chair scene from the novel IS there in the movie version. (Whew! Never thought they'd really do it...but they did).The DVD includes plenty of extras on the casting and making of the film. Interviews with Craig and others. The t.v. show ""Bond Girls Are Forever"" is included on disc two and this is very interesting. Some packagings come with ""Casino Royale"" playing cards as well (mine did).I recommend this DVD highly , as to the performances all around and, particularly to Daniel Craig's. Despite those strange series continuity gaffs (officially intentional) this is one STRONG, STRONG  James Bond outing....AND a movie that turns itself into a ""bookend"" piece for ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" , showing how two deaths by two women...both of whom Bond loved....Vesper Lynd and Tracy Di'Vicenzo...turned Bond inward and put up shields against romantic involvement that persist throughout his life. He loved once...Vesper...in ""Casino"" and her death shut him down emotionally. Years later he took a second chance withTracy in ""OHMSS""...and she died, too. After that the shutdown was largely complete. He would never risk that kind of pain again, would never let anyone get that close again.Watch ""Casino Royale"" and enjoy it. Then watch ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" for the rest of the story. Your outlook on why James Bond is ""the way he is"" will likely never quite be the same.",4,Three Cheers for Mr. Blond,1173744000,"03 13, 2007",2007,5912,"['Having', 'been', 'one', 'people', 'who',

Scott Heitman,"[3, 6]","While many I knew thought that a blond guy couldn't possibly pull off Bond, I had seen Layer Cake and was pretty sure that Craig was capable of much.  What I didn't expect, was a screenplay so well written and updated that comparisons to recent Bond films would seem an insult.  Detailed breakdown as follows:Acting:  While everybody does a great job, Daniel Craig and Eva Green are quite fantastic.  Green is appropriately playful and serious when the role requires it.  She gets many of the movie's best lines.  Your opinion of Craig's performance will come down to how well you understand what's being done to the character over the course of the movie.  Given that you do, Craig's performance is masterful.  I can't say more without spoiling something.Score: Arnold's score feels VERY traditional.  I couldn't distinguish the main Bond theme in the end credits from its counterpart in early Bond movies.  This is good, though- it makes the movie feel connected to its early predecessors.  There are also some achingly beautful but short cues associated with scene changes where the camera pans over long highways, etc.Effects: For a number of reasons, the effects are not the main attraction here.  However, when they are called for, they are pretty spectacular.  This isn't the gadget-driven Bond of recent years, but technology is rather seamlessly integrated into the film.Plot: I've slowly learned that you don't go into Bond movies (and more generally, action movies) looking to be impressed by plot.  There's a certain plot structure that you know will be observed.  In this Bond, I didn't know most of the time where the plot was headed.  This aspect, alone, left me glued to the screen.  Casino Royale is, of course, based on the first Bond novel of the same name.  The powers that be decided to update the story and essentially restart the character a la Batman Begins.

He's more rough-hewn than pretty boy Pierce Brosnan and more akin to Timothy Dalton, albeit without the smirk. In any event, Craig has the gravitas to pull-off the role with zero doubt, unlike Brosnan, who was cool, but he sometimes seemed to struggle in the role; Craig, by contrast, is utterly convincing.Let's face it, James Bond movies are not deep films. They may have convoluted plots, but there's little character depth and no heavy subtext commenting on the human condition. They're spy thrillers with an ultra-cool protagonist, beautiful women, spectacular locations, amazing gadgets, intrigue and action. That's it. Yet they're very entertaining, which is why the series has been such a hit since 1962 when ""Dr. No"" was released.But, again, with the exception of ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" (1969), there's very little, if any, character depth. Take James himself: Women to him are only meaningful as (1.) a sexual dalliance or (2.) a means to fulfill his mission. I mention this to point out that ""Casino Royale"" (2006) boldly changes this. The film has character depth and shows why Bond is the way he is. For instance, there are a couple amazing conversations between James and his potential babe in the story, Vesper (Eva Green), and they're full of insights. The dialog is snappy & intriguing and the performances are right-on.By the way, someone complained that all the women in Bond flicks are loose and willing to sleep with any man at the drop of a hat. No, they're just willing to sleep with James Bond at the drop of a hat, lol. I'm not saying it's right, but it does reflect the exciting charisma of Mr. Bond.There are some cool action sequences, like the long, unrelenting chase after the title credits, but there are also some quality dramatic stretches. For instance, the main poker match at the casino is excellently staged and suspenseful.""Casino Royale"" strikes me as a mixture of the first half of ""Goldfinger"" with the serious tone of ""The Living Daylights"" & ""Licence to Kill"".

It is the type of Bond film all Bond fans have been waiting for. No more cute, wink wink, laugh out loud unbelievable moments we've all grown tired of. What Casino Royale did was make a very real film, with real life consequences and added a crap load of action. Awesome!!!Daniel Craig has taken the Bond character and ran away with it. I never saw a more believeable Bond character since the early films of Sean Connery. Ian Flemming's intentions and spirit for the story and character was taken into major consideration and the results were nothing but positive.Daniel Craig takes the Bond character to his early days before he is granted the infamous double O status. Casino Royale's Bond is an unrefined, reckless, unpolished, aggressive, injury prone, cold blooded killer. In essence, a raw piece of meat, that as the film goes on and he gains more experience becomes this prime piece of sirloin. All the Bond signatures we've all come to love and expect are not a part of Bond's nature, but gradually falls into place at the right moments through his experiences. The journey it took to get there is the most fun to watch.What makes Bond such a fan favorite in the past was the way the writers and directors romanticized the character. Bond always had the best gadgets (toys), cool clothes, money, he travelled, women galore, he was smooth, he could fight and play a mean game of cards. Who wouldn't want to be him?Casino Royale took it one step further and said, ""What kind of man emotionally would it take to be a double O agent and what are the dangers involved in such an exciting career?"" Casino Royale's Bond is bruised, bloodied, beaten, stabbed, poisoned and tortured in several occasions. He walks around half the film covered in scabs and scars. He is detached from his feelings and makes a clear statement how he prefers married women because it is less complicated. With no family and friends, he truly is a man alone with nothing to live for, which makes him the perfect candidate for a double O agent.I have not given away too much of the plot, for it is better for all Bond fans to see Casino Royale and experience it for one's self. It's one of the best Bond film to come out in decades and ranks in my top 2 or 3 of James Bond films of all time.A quick note... it is important to remember that this story is supposed to be about Bond before he become the James Bond we all know and love. It's his first time being a double O agent. This is why the writers took liberties with the opening gun barrel scene, the vodka martini, the Aston Martin, and the infamous ""Bond, James Bond"". I found it a great choice to a very old and established character. We get to see how Bond becomes Bond.

Though I've seen them all and enjoyed most of them, I'm always amazed that the formulaic elements that comprised EVERY SINGLE Bond film (theme, girl, gadgets, suit, quips, etc.) never seem to get old.  Studios could keep pumping them out for decades and still have a core audience.  With ""Casino Royale"", however, that formula is turned on its head a bit in telling an ""early Bond"" story chronologically before all the others.  This new convention, and the subtleties (instead of over-the-top antics) seem to completely refresh the series and make this installment my personal favorite.For a basic plot summary, ""Casino Royale"" sees a newly-minted 007 (Daniel Craig) on his first assignment from M (Judi Dench).  In trying to expose terrorist banker Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen), Bond meets up with Felix (Jeffrey Wright) and falls for the beautiful Vesper Lynd (Eva Green).What makes ""Casino Royale"" ultimately so successful is that it actually DOES contain most of the usual ""Bond cannon"" material that we are all so used to seeing.  Instead of being overt and flaunting such material, like the last few Brosnan flicks, this one takes a much more subtle tone.  For example, Craig's Bond is (at first) taken aback by his new ""fitted dinner jacket"", doesn't quite know how he wants his martini, and actually falls for a woman for her overall personality and not...well, you know.  Seeing this ""beginning of Bond"" after so many ""throw it in your face films"" was refreshing.About the only thing missing from ""Casino Royale"" was Q and his many nifty gadgets.  Other than that, the action lives up to the Bond name and this one even has a semi-intriguing plot with a few twists (yay!).Basically, although I would have probably gone on seeing Bond movies forever, the franchise had gotten a bit stale towards the end of Brosnan's run (e.g. Die Another Day).  Thus, going back in time (with a new Bond actor) to tell a different type of story (more grit than flash) was a welcome diversion that put the ""juice"" back into my Bond fan-ship once again.Unless you are a very nit-picky Bond fan or one that thoroughly enjoys the old conventions exactly as they were, ""Casino Royale"" will shoot straight to the top of your ""Best Bond Film Ever"" list.",5,The Beginning Of Bond,1326758400,"01 17, 2012",2012,2305,"['James', 'Bond', 'franchise', 'always', 'been', 'bit', 'mystery', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'enjoyed', 'most', ""'m"", 'always', 'amazed', 'formulaic', 'elements', 'comprised', 'EVERY', 'SINGLE', 'Bond', 'film', 'theme', 'girl', 'gadgets', 'suit', 'quips', 'etc', 'never', 'seem', 'get', 'old', 'Studios', 'could', 'keep', 'pumping', 'out', 'decades', 'still', 'have', 'core', 'audience', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'however', 'formula', 'turned', 'head', 'bit', 'telling', 'early', 'Bond', 'story', 'chronologically', 'others', 'new', 'convention', 'subtleties', 'instead', 'over-the-top', 'antics', 'seem', 'completely', 'refresh', 'series', 'make', 'installment', 'personal', 'favorite.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'newly-minted', '007', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'first', 'assignment', 'M', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'trying', 'expose', 'terrorist', 'banker', 'Le', 'Chiffre', 'Mads', 'Mikkelsen', 'Bond', 'up', 'Felix', 'Jeffrey', 'Wright', 'beautiful', 'Vesper', 'Lynd', 'Eva', 'Green', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'ultimately', 'so', 'successful', 'actually', 'DOES', 'contain', 'most', 'usual', 'Bond', 'cannon', 'material', 'are', 'so', 'used', 'seeing', 'Instead', 'being', 'overt', 'flaunting', 'such', 'material', 'last', 'few', 'Brosnan', 'flicks', 'one', 'much', 'more', 'subtle', 'tone', 'example', 'Craig', 'Bond', 'first', 'taken', 'aback', 'new', 'fitted', 'dinner', 'jacket', ""n't"", 'quite', 'know', 'how', 'martini', 'actually', 'woman', 'overall', 'personality', 'not', 'well', 'know', 'Seeing', 'beginning', 'Bond', 'so', 'many', 'throw', 'face', 'films', 'was', 'only', 'thing', 'missing', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'was', 'Q', 'many', 'nifty', 'gadgets', 'Other', 'action', 'up', 'Bond', 'name', 'one', 'even', 'semi-intriguing', 'plot', 'few', 'twists', 'yay', '.Basically', 'would', 'have', 'probably', 'gone', 'seeing', 'Bond', 'movies', 'forever', 'franchise', 'had', 'gotten', 'bit', 'stale', 'end', 'Brosnan', 'run', 'e.g', 'Die', 'Day', 'Thus', 'going', 'back', 'time', 'new', 'Bond', 'actor', 'tell', 'different', 'type', 'story', 'more', 'grit', 'flash', 'was', 'welcome', 'diversion', 'put', 'juice', 'back', 'Bond', 'fan-ship', 'once', 'are', 'very', 'nit-picky', 'Bond', 'fan', 'one', 'thoroughly', 'old', 'conventions', 'exactly', 'were', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'will', 'shoot', 'straight', 'top', 'Best', 'Bond', 'Film', 'Ever', 'list']",N/A
1048816,A3E6EEPLHZU8OD,B000MNP2K8,"Zach Kluckman ""Tigereyes""","[7, 12]","Wow, here's possibly the worst Bond movie ever made and it's a huge hit....something is really wrong here.On the plus side - ""the new guy"" carries himself well and moves well in the action scenes. In fact he even carries a bad script relatively well. And the first 15 minutes or so have some amazing action, with fluid movement and breath-taking stunts, making it easily the best part of the movie. So I can readily accept him in the role of everyone's favorite spy.BUT- the movie is inconsistent (especially as far as the other films go), has about 6 major plot holes, is ENTIRELY predictable and to be blunt, it just doesn't have the refinement of the others in the franchise. I know this is supposed to be a ""reimagining"" or what have you, but here's the problem - there are more Bond movies than any other character in history, so clearly the series wasn't really suffering so badly that it needed revamping in the first place. In the second, one of the things that always made Bond interesting was that he is a distinguished ladies man, a gentleman spy if you will. Here he is written like every other run of the mill spy on celluloid. For a minute I thought I watching one of the Bourne movies. There are no gadgets, no Q, no sly witticisms (at least none that really work) and Bond has none of the qualities that make him the classic character he is. Here he becomes a clone of the latest successful actioners, and despite the weak ""prequel"" premise, he is simply not remotely related to James Bond. My wife and I were bored silly. On top of that, IF this is supposed to be happening prior to any of the other movies, then the timelines, technologies and characters are so inconsistent that the whole thing falls apart. I for one am tired of movie makers trying to reinvent the wheel with the most succesful franchises in the industry and destroying my favorite characters in the process. If they want to redo a movie then let them take something completely and utterly insipid like Boogey Man and reinvent that.Call me a purist if you want to, but frankly when something works - don't fix it ya know? I think we need to hold movie makers up to higher standards because otherwise they will keep rehashing good movies and continue to fail at coming up with anything original, so I don't think having higher standards is a bad thing. Whatever. Regardless, when watched with an objective eye, this movie fails in every way that counts. If this were a new character, I may have enjoyed it more. But when you try and add your efforts to a legacy like this one, you'd better be able to deliver more than this predictable and obvious tripe.

And I like it that way.Casino Royale is an amazing action thriller. One where the main character just happens to be named James Bond. Daniel Craig's Bond is confident, intelligent, and beyond cool. But he's not invincible. He's a dedicated man who's survived because of his skill and adeptness at reacting quickly. He's a super-spy.The story flows quickly and with stunning cinematography, keeps the audience glued to the screen. This is the kind of movie where watching it in any form other than widescreen seems blasphemous. The director and cinematographer have put so much out there to look at, why would you want to miss any of it?The acting is top notch, and so is the story. The twists and turns may not be entirely unpredictable, but they're clever enough to keep the audience interested. The story falters a bit towards the end when it focuses on the love story and for a good ten minutes feels like some sort of romantic drama, but like any love affair, everyone eventually comes to their senses.Casino Royale is the kind of movie I would expect to see when thinking about the idea of James Bond. I've never been interested in Bond movies in the past because they seemed a bit too over the top and self aware. This film has really brought quality to the 21st century's James Bond, and I'm already looking for a sequel.The 2-disc special collection DVD is nice, but I wasn't that interested in any of the special features: becoming Bond, making of, trailers, etc. But if you're interested in that stuff, it's definitely there: a whole disc of it.Interesting piece of information: There's a 1967 version of Casino Royale starring Peter Sellers, but it's a spy-spoof movie, not a true Bond film.",4,Daniel Craig and Martin Campbell pump life back into Bond franchise,1174348800,"03 20, 2007",2007,1796,"['Having', 'never', 'seen', 'other', 'Bond', 'movies', ""'m"", 'place', 'compare', 'one', 'like', 'way.Casino', 'Royale', 'amazing', 'action', 'thriller', 'One', 'where', 'main', 'character', 'just', 'be', 'named', 'James', 'Bond', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'Bond', 'confident', 'intelligent', 'cool', 'not', 'invincible', 'dedicated', 'man', 'who', 'survived', 'skill', 'adeptness', 'reacting', 'quickly', 'super-spy.The', 'story', 'quickly', 'stunning', 'cinematography', 'audience', 'glued', 'screen', 'kind', 'movie', 'where', 'watching', 'form', 'other', 'widescreen', 'blasphemous', 'director', 'cinematographer', 'have', 'put', 'so', 'much', 'there', 'look', 'why', 'would', 'want', 'miss', 'acting', 'top', 'notch', 'so', 'story', 'twists', 'turns', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'entirely', 'unpredictable', ""'re"", 'clever', 'enough', 'keep', 'audience', 'interested', 'story', 'bit', 'end', 'when', 'love', 'story', 'good', 'ten', 'minutes', 'feels', 'sort', 'romantic', 'drama', 'love', 'affair', 'everyone', 'eventually', 'senses.Casino', 'Royale', 'kind', 'movie', 'would', 'expect', 'see', 'when', 'thinking', 'idea', 'James', 'Bond', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'interested', 'Bond', 'movies', 'past', 'seemed', 'bit', 'too', 'top', 'self', 'aware', 'film', 'really', 'brought', 'quality', '21st', 'century', 'James', 'Bond', ""'m"", 'already', 'looking', 'sequel.The', '2-disc', 'special', 'collection', 'DVD', 'nice', 'was', ""n't"", 'that', 'interested', 'special', 'features', 'becoming', 'Bond', 'making', 'trailers', 'etc', ""'re"", 'interested', 'stuff', 'definitely', 'whole', 'disc', 'it.Interesting', 'piece', 'information', '1967', 'version', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'starring', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'spy-spoof', 'movie', 'not', 'true', 'Bond', 'film']",N/A

Nobody will ever play Bond like Sean Connery did but regardless Craig was AWESOME! True, Craig does not look like the other JB's however, once I saw the movie I totally understood why he was selected! I thought it was a wise choice to leave Craig a dusty blond and I especially liked his intense, ice-blue eyes...So hot! Craig has a very strong presence and is not only believable but edgy, raw and masculine. Much like Connery, Craig lacks the British 'stuffiness' which all the Bonds in between had. Craig really captured what James Bond would be like if he were real, he'd be tough and rugged and not some pretty boy (cough..Brosnan..cough) in a suit with cool gadgets. This movie was surprisingly low on gadgets but with the strong story and Craig's awesome acting, this was not a bad thing. I did miss Q but hey, you can't have it all! The action was awesome, the story was intense and kept my attention in spite of it being so long, Craig was sexy, the humor was dry and but definately there and I really liked the romance too. The Bond girls were great in this one, both are exotic and beautiful ladies. Some say the timeline was flawed and didn't explain gaps etc, but IT'S JAMES BOND and none of the privious movies were particulary realistic either. I found the new approach to this character to be original and refreshing yet it still honored the classic James Bond themes. It was both retro and modern at the same time. The 'chair' scene was BRUTAL, hence my quote above 'a little to your left'...You'll know what scene I mean when you see this movie and a tip for all the ladies: If you are watching the 'chair' scene with a guy, you might want to cover his eyes, OUCH!

He is definitely scruffier and more grim than previous Bonds, but I think that works. Should an assassin be chipper & smiling all the time? Even James Bond? I actually believed that the violence was real, and in most Bond films it is more cartoon-like. The villain is a bit weak here, just didn't scare me all that much, and the film felt like it went on too long, so I subtracted one star. But overall, I think Daniel Craig makes a superb (and extremely hot!)
