Aft er the sequence under the opening credits, where Meg has just another one of those bad dates, she decides to dye her hair blonde to find Mr. Right.  However, after the initial shriek of excitement from her blonde friend, Liv, at the change, the issue is dropped.  Meg goes on a quest for Mr.Right, but her hair seems to have nothing to do with it.  Instead she gets wrapped up in other antics.  A confusing friendship with V-Club Owner Van and a roll-your-eyes at his stupidity one with pretty-boy Brad ensues.  Krista Allen is hilarious as Meg, a quirky but underneath it all good hearted and intelligent woman.  Her attempts at physical comedy are cute, not parallel to Lucille Ball, but still add a lot of fun and flavor to the film.  And personally, I think all women need a Wall of Blame!",4,Not Another Blonde Movie,1061424000,"08 21, 2003",2003,985,"['title', 'may', 'suggest', 'movie', 'full', 'blonde', 'stereotypes', 'jokes', 'movie', 'up', 'being', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'forget', 'character', 'Meg', 'Peters', 'went', 'blonde', 'Aft', 'er', 'sequence', 'opening', 'credits', 'where', 'Meg', 'just', 'one', 'bad', 'dates', 'dye', 'hair', 'blonde', 'find', 'Mr', 'Right', 'However', 'initial', 'shriek', 'excitement', 'blonde', 'friend', 'Liv', 'change', 'issue', 'dropped', 'Meg', 'quest', 'Mr.Right', 'hair', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'Instead', 'wrapped', 'up', 'other', 'antics', 'confusing', 'friendship', 'V-Club', 'Owner', 'Van', 'roll-your-eyes', 'stupidity', 'one', 'pretty-boy', 'Brad', 'ensues', 'Krista', 'Allen', 'hilarious', 'Meg', 'quirky', 'good', 'hearted', 'intelligent', 'woman', 'attempts', 'physical', 'comedy', 'are', 'cute', 'not', 'parallel', 'Lucille', 'Ball', 'still', 'add', 'lot', 'fun', 'flavor', 'film', 'personally', 'think', 'women', 'need', 'Wall', 'Blame']",Totally Blonde

Give 'em a Gold Star.I like most movies I see.  But not this one.Even though I had read some of the reviews, which were less than positive, I didn't think it could be that bad.  I'm a fan of soaps - Krista Allen (Days of Our Lives), Mauve Quinlan (Bold and the Beautiful, 90210) and Brody Hutzler (Young and the Restless, Days Of Our Lives) are actors that I've known of, and watched, for years.But first and foremost, I am a fan of Michael Buble.  He is the reason why I decided to buy this movie and give it a shot.  I had never seen it on TV, I couldn't find a rental copy (after seeing it, I'm not surprised as no reputable rental establishment like Blockbuster would carry it).  So, I bought it.  He shows a bit of promise as an actor, although after seeing him perform this past summer, his passion is clearly music.The only reason that I didn't turn this crap off within the first 10 minutes was because I knew that Michael had a fairly sizable role.Do yourselves a favor and stay away from buying this movie.

i saw that a few days ago!"" now i'm REALLY wishing i had payed attention to the daly interview a few nights before! arghhhanyway,in this movie, krista who plays a girl named meg is having an emotional tug-of-war with a guy she likes and another guy who she is really heads over heels for.  but the guy she just likes, or as she calls him, her 'friend', happens to be the real life singer(or more accurately, crooner)michael buble. and michael, in this movie, plays a guy named van who owns a jazz club featuring himself as a singer very much in the mold of michael himself. i hope this is not too confusing! lolanyway, van is a very sweet guy and meg is very close to upgrading him from 'friend' status to something more when along comes an old high school crush-the guy she falls head over heels with. but van is really smitten with meg and sings to her several times in his soft and debonair style-anything a girl would melt for.i did not realize until after the movie was over that this singing and the actor playing van is actually the singer michael buble~!as well as having an outstanding singing style, michael is a very good actor. i really enjoyed watching his character in this movie. the part he played, van, was so likeable and natural and easy-going.it kind of makes your head spin when meg becomes infatuated with her old high school crush who's a rather dorky(but, yes, hot looking hunk)surfer dude and in the process giving van his walking papers.without giving the whole story away i would like to conclude with what i feel is a new discovery-her name:krista allen.in this movie, she played her part of meg so sweet and playful. i really fell for her in a big way. she may look like a typical stuck up 'dumb blonde' but that stereotype does not apply here to fun-loving and big-hearted meg.as played by krista i really fell in love with her, and krista.i also thank this movie for introducing me to mr. buble-a great singer and actor .if i may sum up this movie it would make sense to use the code that van himself uses several times during the movie......""i.a.g."" which stands for 'it's all good'!oh wait!........it's not ALL good because the dvd version of totally blonde does not.....repeat....does NOT include the ESSENTIAL scene wherein meg/krista strips down to her bare essentials!
