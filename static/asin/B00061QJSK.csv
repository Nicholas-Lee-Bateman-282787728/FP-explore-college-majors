855422,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00061QJSK,,"[4, 4]","CRUSADE is the only spin off of BABYLON 5, but one that never really got off the ground.  Part of the problem is that it never really developed much in the way of compelling internal arcs and part of the problem was that it never was given much time to do so.  BABYLON 5 was a series that was very, very slow to develop.  The first two seasons were quite static and almost dull as various plot elements were slowly dropped into place.  Eventually there was a pay off, and a big one at that.  But the truth is that it was just really slow to develop.  CRUSADE likewise was very slow out of the gate.  Would it have become as good as B5?  There is no evidence of that.  There seems to have been very, very little in the way of long arcs developing, though even in the case of B5 some of the arcs can be seen on reviewing early episodes, but were hard to detect on first viewings.  But the brute fact is that CRUSADE was, through the 13 completed episodes, simply not very exciting.Just because CRUSADE was not terribly good as executed doesn't mean that it wouldn't have gotten better.  This was not a show without potential.  It did not have the jaw-dropping brilliance that FIREFLY displayed over a comparable number of episodes (which will always ignite the debate over precisely what FOX was thinking when it cancelled that gem), but it nonetheless had potential.A slowness to develop wasn't the only problem the show had in its short run.  The use of the cast was astonishingly inconsistent.  Now, B5 often would run for several episodes without opening credits characters putting in an appearance, but that was only after they all were firmly established.  CRUSADE might lose a character for three straight episodes.  The only character guaranteed to appear in each episode was Gary Cole.  Tracy Scoggins was an opening credits character but did not finally appear on the show until several episodes into the season.  Peter Woodard, who as the technomage Galen may have been the show's most compelling and fascinating character (certainly he was the only one I wanted to know more about), appeared in only about two-thirds of the episodes.  He tended to be dominant in the ones in which he did appear, but that merely reemphasized his absence in the ones in which he did not.  We did not even begin to scratch the surface of the main characters.  For instance, it appears that Galen was probably a self-created cyborg.  In the last episode in which he appeared we learned that his eyes had been replaced by ocular implants and a brief look at his bare back revealed that he had a number of mechanical implants of one kind or another.Ultimately, this is a show that simply never came out with all guns blazing.  We'll never know if it had more potential or not.  There were some good individual episodes, as well as some fun ones.  I enjoyed seeing Peter Woodward and his father, the Equalizer himself, Edward Woodward.  And there was a fun late-series episode that was a great parody of THE X-FILES.  The Excalibur finds an alien life pod in open space and picks them up.  Inside are two conspiracy-minded aliens dressed very much in the style of Mulder and Scully.  The female's head tentacles, which resembled hair slightly, were red like Scully's hair and she wore high-heeled shoes under her slacks in the best Scully fashion.  The two accuse the humans of constantly abducting people from their planet and of being involved in a conspiracy with a mysterious man who bears more than a little resemblance to the CSM (that is Cigarette Smoking Man, for non-X-Filers), a resemblance that was cemented when he pulls out a cigarette and lights up as he departs Excalibur.  All in all it was fun.One thing that they might have done to generate more interest in the show was to have more guest appearances by members of the B5 cast.  Although the show had been set up by A CALL TO ARMS, the series itself was generally devoid of B5 cast members apart from Tracy Scoggins's Captain Lochley.  But I think that more of an attempt to bring in familiar faces would have helped.  Apart from Scoggins, the only B5 regular to even appear on the show was Richard Biggs as Steven Franklin.I can't really recommend this series to anyone except BABYLON 5 completists.  If you feel the need to watch absolutely everything connected to B5, go for it.  It seems appropriate that one of the very last scenes on the show occurred when Excalibur was taking Captain Lochley back to B5.",3,A record of unrealized potential,1205020800,"03 9, 2008",2008,4467,"['CRUSADE', 'only', 'spin', 'BABYLON', '5', 'one', 'never', 'really', 'got', 'ground', 'Part', 'problem', 'never', 'really', 'developed', 'much', 'way', 'compelling', 'internal', 'arcs', 'part', 'problem', 'was', 'never', 'was', 'given', 'much', 'time', 'do', 'so', 'BABYLON', '5', 'was', 'series', 'was', 'very', 'very', 'slow', 'develop', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'were', 'quite', 'static', 'almost', 'dull', 'various', 'plot', 'elements', 'were', 'slowly', 'dropped', 'place', 'Eventually', 'was', 'pay', 'off', 'big', 'one', 'truth', 'was', 'just', 'really', 'slow', 'develop', 'CRUSADE', 'likewise', 'was', 'very', 'slow', 'gate', 'Would', 'have', 'become', 'as', 'good', 'B5', 'evidence', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'very', 'little', 'way', 'long', 'arcs', 'developing', 'though', 'even', 'case', 'B5', 'arcs', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'reviewing', 'early', 'episodes', 'were', 'hard', 'detect', 'first', 'viewings', 'brute', 'fact', 'CRUSADE', 'was', '13', 'completed', 'episodes', 'simply', 'not', 'very', 'exciting.Just', 'CRUSADE', 'was', 'not', 'terribly', 'good', 'executed', ""n't"", 'mean', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'gotten', 'better', 'was', 'not', 'show', 'potential', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'jaw-dropping', 'brilliance', 'FIREFLY', 'displayed', 'over', 'comparable', 'number', 'episodes', 'will', 'always', 'ignite', 'debate', 'precisely', 'what', 'FOX', 'was', 'thinking', 'when', 'cancelled', 'gem', 'nonetheless', 'had', 'potential.A', 'slowness', 'develop', 'was', ""n't"", 'only', 'problem', 'show', 'had', 'short', 'run', 'use', 'cast', 'was', 'astonishingly', 'inconsistent', 'Now', 'B5', 'often', 'would', 'run', 'several', 'episodes', 'opening', 'credits', 'characters', 'putting', 'appearance', 'was', 'only', 'were', 'firmly', 'established', 'CRUSADE', 'might', 'lose', 'character', 'three', 'straight', 'episodes', 'only', 'character', 'guaranteed', 'appear', 'episode', 'was', 'Gary', 'Cole', 'Tracy', 'Scoggins', 'was', 'opening', 'credits', 'character', 'did', 'not', 'finally', 'appear', 'show', 'several', 'episodes', 'season', 'Peter', 'Woodard', 'who', 'technomage', 'Galen', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'show', 'most', 'compelling', 'fascinating', 'character', 'certainly', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'wanted', 'know', 'more', 'appeared', 'only', 'two-thirds', 'episodes', 'tended', 'be', 'dominant', 'ones', 'did', 'appear', 'merely', 'reemphasized', 'absence', 'ones', 'did', 'not', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'begin', 'scratch', 'surface', 'main', 'characters', 'instance', 'Galen', 'was', 'probably', 'self-created', 'cyborg', 'last', 'episode', 'appeared', 'learned', 'eyes', 'had', 'been', 'replaced', 'ocular', 'implants', 'brief', 'look', 'bare', 'back', 'revealed', 'had', 'number', 'mechanical', 'implants', 'one', 'kind', 'another.Ultimately', 'show', 'simply', 'never', 'came', 'out', 'guns', 'blazing', ""'ll"", 'never', 'know', 'had', 'more', 'potential', 'not', 'were', 'good', 'individual', 'episodes', 'as', 'well', 'fun', 'ones', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'Peter', 'Woodward', 'father', 'Equalizer', 'Edward', 'Woodward', 'was', 'fun', 'late-series', 'episode', 'was', 'great', 'parody', 'X-FILES', 'Excalibur', 'alien', 'life', 'pod', 'open', 'space', 'picks', 'up', 'Inside', 'are', 'two', 'conspiracy-minded', 'aliens', 'dressed', 'very', 'much', 'style', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'female', 'head', 'tentacles', 'resembled', 'hair', 'slightly', 'were', 'red', 'Scully', 'hair', 'wore', 'high-heeled', 'shoes', 'slacks', 'best', 'Scully', 'fashion', 'two', 'humans', 'constantly', 'abducting', 'people', 'planet', 'being', 'involved', 'conspiracy', 'mysterious', 'man', 'who', 'more', 'little', 'resemblance', 'CSM', 'Cigarette', 'Smoking', 'Man', 'non-X-Filers', 'resemblance', 'was', 'cemented', 'when', 'out', 'cigarette', 'up', 'Excalibur', 'was', 'fun.One', 'thing', 'might', 'have', 'done', 'generate', 'more', 'interest', 'show', 'was', 'have', 'more', 'guest', 'appearances', 'members', 'B5', 'cast', 'show', 'had', 'been', 'set', 'up', 'A', 'CALL', 'TO', 'ARMS', 'series', 'was', 'generally', 'devoid', 'B5', 'cast', 'members', 'apart', 'Tracy', 'Scoggins', 'Captain', 'Lochley', 'think', 'more', 'attempt', 'bring', 'familiar', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'Apart', 'Scoggins', 'only', 'B5', 'regular', 'even', 'appear', 'show', 'was', 'Richard', 'Biggs', 'Steven', 'Franklin.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'recommend', 'series', 'anyone', 'BABYLON', '5', 'completists', 'feel', 'need', 'watch', 'absolutely', 'everything', 'connected', 'B5', 'go', 'appropriate', 'one', 'very', 'last', 'scenes', 'show', 'occurred', 'when', 'Excalibur', 'was', 'taking', 'Captain', 'Lochley', 'back', 'B5']",Crusade: The Complete Series

To best understand this series, watch the prequel movie ""A Call to Arms"" first.An alien species has infected Earth with a deadly virus.  If a cure isn't found, everyone on Earth will be dead within five years with only the few humans who were on other planets, battleships or space stations at the time of infection being whose left of humanity.

They are to go anywhere and do whatever it takes to succeed in that goal.It is too bad this series was cut short. It was interesting and Gary Cole made a great lead actor--not your typical stuffy military-type at all.

855453,A1EAFFJQ2NDHGC,B00061QJSK,Eric J. Anderson,"[1, 2]","Babylon 5 had a sort of grandeur to it, in the sweep of the story, the relationships between the characters, the social issues that were skewered or commented on, and the galactic peril that developed as its main story arc. It was hoped that Crusade could succeed Babylon 5 for another five successful years, carrying on the history of humans after the Shadow War and the formation of the planetary Alliance.Crusade was, so to speak, murdered in its crib. It never got much of a chance to grow. It never had all the strengths of its predecessor, and it suffered a few weaknesses as well.Briefly, what I liked about the series: Galen, the enigmatic techno-mage, who was probably the best actor and got the best speeches. Dureena, the alien thief whose sass was entertaining and whose courage got the Crusade team out of a pickle or two. As the series progressed the crew were starting to develop a sense of family and camaraderie, like the Babylon 5 team. The Excalibur was a pretty ship, and quite a few interior sets were built to show different parts of the craft.Weaknessess: The special effects of ships in orbit and in battle were good. The special effects of planetary landscapes looked cheap. The musical score wasn't as weighty or as appropriate as the music for Babylon 5. Gary Cole's Captain Gideon is a more flawed and somewhat less heroic figure, compared to B5's Cap'n Sheridan. In a way that makes him more interesting, but he also seems to have a dangerously headstrong or capricious streak. (To say nothing of his questionable tactic of getting advice from an alien machine called an ""apocalypse box"" that has a tendency to give false information.) The lack of a great story arc to tie the episodes together was somewhat of a weakness. Whereas B5 dealt with interplanetary conflicts between whole races, and the war between two super-powerful ancient alien powers, Crusade's plots were narrowly focused on one spacecraft and its mission to find a cure for a planetary plague. The scale is somehow smaller.After watching all 13 episodes, I find myself overlooking a lot of the ways that it fell short. I'm quite fond of it, and will watch it again from time to time.

855455,A3GGUBZMTQD1B9,B00061QJSK,Esther Schindler,"[15, 17]","If you're a fan of Babylon 5, you're probably tempted to buy Crusade. After all, it was the short-lived follow-on to B5, put together by the B5 creator and with a few of the same cast members.DO buy it. Just don't come to the Crusade series with the same set of expectations, because you're going to be disappointed.Crusade is a too-perfect example of ""creation by committee."" The REAL main premise of Crusade works, particularly if you followed B5: the servants of the shadows had dropped a plague on the Earth, and the Crusade crew are traveling the universe to find a cure. Unfortunately, the ""creative"" people at TNT, which was better at putting together smack-down wrestling, insisted on making changes to the Crusade premise, characters (they wanted one alien whose main purpose was to have sex with as many races as possible), and even uniforms (which is why JMS had to come up with a hokey episode to change the uniforms).The result is moments of brilliance, mixed with irritating situations. And, because the TNT people claimed that new watchers wouldn't have a context for the show (although they ended up showing the B5 movie that introduced the plague, right before the season premiere aired), they insisted that the scripts bring everybody up to date. So, Crusade wastes a lot of time telling you what you already know. And, since the story sort-of starts twice, it wastes a lot of time on that. If you're a B5 fan, you know that JMS tends to trust the audience to figure it out as you go along, and he doesn't do that here.I recently re-watched the whole season. There are just enough episodes to really *introduce* each of the characters. And I have the sense that the story was just about to get underway when it was cancelled. It's as though JMS put a whole bunch of interesting questions on the table, right before the lights went out.Nonetheless, I do recommend that B5 fans get and watch the series. First, you'll enjoy seeing that JMS did have an idea of where things were headed. (And he did say in the usenet newsgroups that finding the cure to the plague was only the beginning of the story, which had a multi-year arc.) You'll enjoy a visit to a well-crafted universe you remember. You'll enjoy seeing a new batch of interesting new characters who, darnit, I want to learn what happened to. And you'll have a too-painful example of TNT corporate politics gone wrong, horribly wrong.If you aren't a fan of Babylon 5, I'd skip Crusade. I think it *does* require knowledge of the B5 universe; otherwise you'd see the flaws and not the best-of-B5.

If it were about a random group of people in a spaceship finding a cure for a plague maybe but as it stands let me give you the rundown.First the goodDureena Nafeel (Carrie Dobro) a thief who does everything see can to get the job done.  I always liked her she can work her way out of a tight spot and think her way out of any given situation.Max Eilerson (David Allen Brooks):in spite of being an overbearing jerk Eilerson does have his moments when those moments come he does show that there is a real person under that brash sarcastic exterior.Galen (Peter Woodward a technomage the last time we saw these people was in Babylon 5 season two when they were fleeing the approaching shadows Galen interfered on our behalf and as a consequence was banished.  I'll be perfectly honest he was the best part of the show those episodes where something interesting happened were usually about some element of technomageism he carried the show on his own.Middle of the roadLieutenant John Matheson (Daniel Dae Kim) there is one particularly good moment with this character when it shows his involvement with a particular raid during the telepath war but most of the time he has Lt. Uhura syndrome he runs ships communications and JMS shows that he is tolerant of other races.Captain Matthew Gideon (Gary Cole) my problem is he can never decide on which type of captain he wants to be brash and arrogant or diplomatic and sensitive.  Pick a mood for the sake of your crew captainThe badDr. Sarah Chambers (Marjean Holden): ship's medical officer.  Think all the self righteousness of Steven Franklin without the sense of humor..  Captain Elizabeth Lochley (Tracy Scoggins)-Whoever came up with this bright idea needs to be punched in a very uncomfortable place it makes no sense take the most unpopular part of season 5 and give her a few guest spots on the new show and just to confuse everyone set her up as Gideon's love interest and make her disappear.

And yet, this series fulfilled its promise and then much more. ""Crusade"" would have become another splendid science fiction series, being the ""Babylon 5"" universe equivalent of ""Star Trek: Enterprise"" or ""Star Trek: The Original Series"" or perhaps most aptly, ""Star Trek: Voyager"". Unfortunately some studio executives lacked the patience for series creator's J. Michael Straczynski's vision, so the plug was pulled after thirteen episodes. Speaking of which, I have no doubt that ""Crusade"" could have told more exciting, dramatically impressive tales than virtually all of those which became episodes of ""Star Trek: Enterprise"" and ""Star Trek: Voyager"".Much to his credit, J. Michael Straczynski did assemble a decent cast for the crew of the experimental EarthForce/Interstellar Alliance warship Excalibur: Captain Matthew Gideon (Gary Cole), telepathic first officer John Matheson (Daniel Dae Kim), archaeologist and linguist Max Eilerson (David Allen Brooks), Dureena, a member of the Thieves' Guild and the last surviving member of her species (Carrie Dobro), medical officer Sarah Chambers (Marjean Holden) and technomage Galen (Peter Woodward). Without a doubt, the most intriguing character was Galen, though both Captain Gideon and Dureena had memorable moments too.

If the cure isn't found in a few years, then all life on Earth will be wiped out. Series creator J. Michael Straczynski intended that this series would be less story arc-driven than ""Babylon 5"", offering viewers more stand-alone episodes.

I watched the episodes in the official chronological order by Straczynski and I was glad I did. which is as follows:1 ""War Zone""2 ""The Long Road""3 ""Ruling from the Tomb""4 ""Appearances and Other Deceits""5 ""The Memory of War6 ""The Needs of Earth""7 ""Racing the Night""8 ""Visitors from Down the Street""9 ""Each Night I Dream of Home""10 ""The Path of Sorrows""11 ""Patterns of the Soul""12 ""The Well of Forever""13 ""The Rules of the Game""The problem with this series is that the story-lines are very compressed and there is not a lot of character building dialog that allows you to discover all the details of any particular person. There is a lot of ""I'm the captain, that's why"" and ""That's how it is, take it or leave it"" type dialog. They did not have the time to flesh out the personalities and nuances that made you love the or hate the characters. In Babylon 5 for example, the character development was so great that you really had a feeling of who these people were and why.I think the problems stem from a combination of the studio not getting it and simply the year it was produced. Shows back in the late nineties and early 2000's were unfortunately balanced against outrageous viewership numbers and many outstanding shows never had a chance to grow. Firefly was another show that was a casualty of the same viewership issues. If Firefly was released today and received the numbers it garnered back in 2002 we would still be watching it.I love the B5 universe! It is so rich with great ideas that it should warrant another re-write and screening. Imaging the entire B5 universe recaptured with today's technology! When they re-imagined the Battlestar Galactica series I was outraged that they would attempt such a thing and refused to watch the blasphemous rewrite of one of my most beloved shows from my childhood! I was so way beyond wrong on every level! Battlestar Galactica is a prime example of what a show could become when the writers have a lot of control! I tried watching the original Battlestar Galactica and was almost embarrassed at how bad it was.So the point of all this rambling is I think the entire B5 storyline needs to be updated for a new generation and Crusade needs to be re-conceived  because there is a lot of substance left here to be explored.It's a must see set for any huge B5 fan and the price is right. so get it but don't expect the richness of B5",3,Mediocre material wasted on a great cast set in one of the best sci-fi settings,1363824000,"03 21, 2013",2013,2584,"['have', 'recently', 'finished', 'watching', 'Babylon', '5', 'boxed', 'set', 'several', 'spin-offs', 'was', 'very', 'happy', 'everything', 'have', 'seen', 'watched', 'Crusade', 'suggestion', 'friend', 'watched', 'episodes', 'official', 'chronological', 'order', 'Straczynski', 'was', 'glad', 'did', 'follows:1', 'War', 'Zone', '2', 'Long', 'Road', '3', 'Ruling', 'Tomb', '4', 'Appearances', 'Other', 'Deceits', '5', 'Memory', 'War6', 'Needs', 'Earth', '7', 'Racing', 'Night', '8', 'Visitors', 'Street', '9', 'Night', 'Dream', 'Home', '10', 'Path', 'Sorrows', '11', 'Patterns', 'Soul', '12', 'Well', 'Forever', '13', 'Rules', 'Game', 'problem', 'series', 'story-lines', 'are', 'very', 'compressed', 'not', 'lot', 'character', 'building', 'dialog', 'discover', 'details', 'particular', 'person', 'lot', ""'m"", 'captain', 'why', 'how', 'take', 'leave', 'type', 'dialog', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'time', 'flesh', 'out', 'personalities', 'nuances', 'made', 'love', 'hate', 'characters', 'Babylon', '5', 'example', 'character', 'development', 'was', 'so', 'great', 'really', 'had', 'feeling', 'who', 'people', 'were', 'why.I', 'think', 'problems', 'stem', 'combination', 'studio', 'not', 'getting', 'simply', 'year', 'was', 'produced', 'Shows', 'back', 'late', 'nineties', 'early', '2000', 'were', 'unfortunately', 'balanced', 'outrageous', 'viewership', 'numbers', 'many', 'outstanding', 'shows', 'never', 'had', 'chance', 'grow', 'Firefly', 'was', 'show', 'was', 'casualty', 'same', 'viewership', 'issues', 'Firefly', 'was', 'released', 'today', 'received', 'numbers', 'garnered', 'back', '2002', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'watching', 'it.I', 'B5', 'universe', 'so', 'rich', 'great', 'ideas', 'should', 'warrant', 're-write', 'screening', 'Imaging', 'entire', 'B5', 'universe', 'recaptured', 'today', 'technology', 'When', 're-imagined', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'series', 'was', 'outraged', 'would', 'attempt', 'such', 'thing', 'refused', 'watch', 'blasphemous', 'rewrite', 'one', 'most', 'beloved', 'shows', 'childhood', 'was', 'so', 'way', 'wrong', 'level', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'prime', 'example', 'what', 'show', 'could', 'become', 'when', 'writers', 'have', 'lot', 'control', 'tried', 'watching', 'original', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'was', 'almost', 'embarrassed', 'how', 'bad', 'was.So', 'point', 'rambling', 'think', 'entire', 'B5', 'storyline', 'needs', 'be', 'updated', 'new', 'generation', 'Crusade', 'be', 're-conceived', 'lot', 'substance', 'left', 'here', 'be', 'explored.It', 'must', 'see', 'set', 'huge', 'B5', 'fan', 'price', 'right', 'so', 'get', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'richness', 'B5']",Crusade: The Complete Series

And there was a driving mission -- to find a cure for a plague that threatened to destroy humanity -- except that quite often that pressing need got shoved on the back burner while the main actors dealt with some other problem, sometimes rather mundane. There were assorted little continuity problems, at times writing that was pretty sappy, and special effects that ranged from pretty good to slightly amusing in a bad way. Sounds like pretty much of a loser to me, and Crusade was just that, at least as measured by the length of its paltry run. Still, there are elements that suggest this might have been a reasonably good science fiction series had it been given enough time to find its legs. It already had a wealth of background from Babylon 5 to draw upon, and despite the silly words that were sometimes put into their mouths, the cast was more than credible and had the spark that could have made them truly endearing.

855484,A3KB1H0S7T6JX1,B00061QJSK,L Gontzes,"[2, 2]","Season V of Babylon 5 ended in a way that had us gasping for air, reaching for tissues, and wanting more B5. The films, The Legend of the Rangers and the Crusade series helped keep the dream alive, as do the Lost Tales, so that sometime in the not-so-distant future we can have a B5-universe series to look forward to.The Shadow Wars ended with the Drakh unleashing their deadly virus on Earth and contaminating the planet's population. Crusade brings to the screen the adventures of the command crew of the new Earth-Minbari hybrid Destroyer-class Excalibur under Captain Matthew Gideon as it travels around the universe looking for a cure for the Drakh plague, while the clock is ticking with less than five years left before humanity on Earth is something of the past.The series starts off rather bland with the first four episodes testing my resolve to watch the series through. However, Crusade eventually picks up as the actors get accustomed to one another and the audience gets accustomed to them.On the down side, Captain Gideon (brings to mind Kevin Bacon) does not have that special something that Sinclair and Sheridan had.Moreover, the acting, the dialogues, and at times the CGI are not that great, and that does have an effect on the overall enjoyment.In addition, neither Marjean Holden nor her character (Sarah Chambers) was all that likable; no comparison at all to Dr. Franklin!Finally, the poor music is not enjoyable in the least and it makes you want to hurt someone!On the positive side, it is such a pleasure to see Tracy Scoggins and the late Richard Biggs.Moreover, my initial thoughts of Crusade's command crew being set up a bit like Dungeons and Dragons with the mage, the thief, the telepath, the warrior, even the grouchy cavalier (from the D&D; cartoon) in the obnoxious archaeologist etc. were confirmed when Straczynski actually mentions it in the extra features, which are definitely worth viewing.It is a shame that Crusade was cancelled before it was given the chance to fully bloom. It was supposed to run for 5 years, but they pulled the plug after only 13 episodes. In conclusion, though it does not start strong, Crusade grows on you. Hopefully, the fans loyalty and undying desire for more B5 will result in another spinoff, this one with the potential to stay the course. 3.8 Stars",4,Just as it was getting good!,1258416000,"11 17, 2009",2009,2324,"['Season', 'V', 'Babylon', '5', 'ended', 'way', 'had', 'gasping', 'air', 'reaching', 'tissues', 'wanting', 'more', 'B5', 'films', 'Legend', 'Rangers', 'Crusade', 'series', 'helped', 'keep', 'dream', 'alive', 'do', 'Lost', 'Tales', 'sometime', 'not-so-distant', 'future', 'can', 'have', 'B5-universe', 'series', 'look', 'forward', 'to.The', 'Shadow', 'Wars', 'ended', 'Drakh', 'unleashing', 'deadly', 'virus', 'Earth', 'contaminating', 'planet', 'population', 'Crusade', 'brings', 'screen', 'adventures', 'command', 'crew', 'new', 'Earth-Minbari', 'hybrid', 'Destroyer-class', 'Excalibur', 'Captain', 'Matthew', 'Gideon', 'universe', 'looking', 'cure', 'Drakh', 'plague', 'clock', 'ticking', 'less', 'five', 'years', 'left', 'humanity', 'Earth', 'something', 'past.The', 'series', 'rather', 'bland', 'first', 'four', 'episodes', 'testing', 'resolve', 'watch', 'series', 'However', 'Crusade', 'eventually', 'up', 'actors', 'get', 'accustomed', 'one', 'audience', 'accustomed', 'them.On', 'down', 'side', 'Captain', 'Gideon', 'mind', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'not', 'have', 'special', 'something', 'Sinclair', 'Sheridan', 'had.Moreover', 'acting', 'dialogues', 'times', 'CGI', 'are', 'not', 'great', 'have', 'effect', 'overall', 'enjoyment.In', 'addition', 'Marjean', 'Holden', 'character', 'Sarah', 'Chambers', 'was', 'likable', 'comparison', 'Dr.', 'Franklin', 'Finally', 'poor', 'music', 'not', 'enjoyable', 'least', 'want', 'hurt', 'someone', 'positive', 'side', 'such', 'pleasure', 'see', 'Tracy', 'Scoggins', 'late', 'Richard', 'Biggs.Moreover', 'initial', 'thoughts', 'Crusade', 'command', 'crew', 'being', 'set', 'up', 'bit', 'Dungeons', 'Dragons', 'mage', 'thief', 'telepath', 'warrior', 'even', 'grouchy', 'cavalier', 'D', 'D', 'cartoon', 'obnoxious', 'archaeologist', 'etc', 'were', 'confirmed', 'when', 'Straczynski', 'actually', 'extra', 'features', 'are', 'definitely', 'worth', 'viewing.It', 'shame', 'Crusade', 'was', 'cancelled', 'was', 'given', 'chance', 'fully', 'bloom', 'was', 'supposed', 'run', '5', 'years', 'pulled', 'plug', 'only', '13', 'episodes', 'conclusion', 'not', 'start', 'strong', 'Crusade', 'Hopefully', 'fans', 'loyalty', 'undying', 'desire', 'more', 'B5', 'will', 'result', 'spinoff', 'one', 'potential', 'stay', 'course', '3.8', 'Stars']",Crusade: The Complete Series

TNT cancelled Crusade months before it was even aired. Hence Crusade was NOT cancelled because of Crusade's ratings numbers, but because TNT had found out that ""Babylon 5"" itself was a bad fit for their core audience.  Crusade's cancellation had little or nothing to do with Crusade itself.  It just had the misfortune to start out on the WRONG channel, a sci-fi unfriendly channel.2. In the ""A Call to Arms"" (B5 Movie Collection DVD Set), JMS mentions that the plague was a hook (Earth in jeopardy) that Warner Brothers and TNT felt that the Crusade series needed to start off with.  The plague was something that they needed to get INTO the Crusade storyline (politically, with what the Shadows left behind, and the conspiracy back on Earth, Galen and the Technomage connection to Shadowtech that's expounded upon in the Technomage trilogy of novels, etc.).****************************************""Good Show and I Will DEFINITELY Buy It."" (added Dec. 2, 2004)I will buy it BECAUSE I enjoyed the episodes that WERE produced (ditto for Brimstone, Strange Luck, The Ellen Show, Special Unit 2, Firefly, Keen Eddie, Wonderfalls, Boomtown, The Tick, etc.).  I already have Firefly and The Tick, will be buying Keen Eddie, Wonderfalls, and Boomtown, shortly, and will buy the rest when they become available.I will buy it BECAUSE I want to show support for a good show that was mishandled and prematurely cancelled (just like most of the other shows listed above.).I will also buy it because there is a chance that the Crusade story will be continued (theatrical release, novels, etc.).**********From jmsnewsDOTcom""TranscriptSpeaker: Joe Michael StraczynskiLocation: Hawthorne High School Comic ConDate: 5/8/2004""Q&A; sessionRoom 120 - Fans begin gathering and taking their places in traditional school desks. Some of us haven't seen the like for...a long time. Before us is a perfectly clean blackboard. While we wait for JMS, somebody (okay, I did it) writes in large letters "" MR. STRACZYNSKI"" and below it, ""T M o S 101""3:00 PM. JMS arrives and, without a word, goes to the board and erases the ""TMOS 101"" part amid much laughter.....Audience: Any (plans?) to address the Crusade story?JMS: Uh....(gestures toward the erased blackboard) Other questions.....Audience: Out of all your cancelled projects, which one would you like to resume first?JMS: There's only been a couple. (laughter) He's being mean to me! Umm...Crusade. That's the obvious choice because that one was cut short...it was shot in it's cradle by unfair means and that pisses me off. So I will fix that one way or the other.**********And given what JMS said immediately above, it's likely that at least some of the upcoming new novels...**********From jmsnewsDOTcom""Subject: re: various from jmsDate: 6/15/2004 5:58:58 AM""""Also, expect word fairly soon-ish about a new series of B5 novels.""**********... will likely continue the Crusade story.

I wouldn't buy a novel with the FRONT 50 pages missing.  Also, with the television performances to draw upon, I can better ""see"" the story unfold in a novel as I read it.  I enjoyed the last three trilogies of novels more, for that very reason.With all of the above in mind, I will DEFINITELY be buying the Crusade DVD Set.****************************************FINALLY, 4:3 (FULL FRAME) **AS IT SHOULD BE**. (added Dec. 17, 2004)Unlike all of the Babylon 5 series, this DVD set is not widescreen - WHEW! FINALLY, they do the RIGHT thing!!!  The CGI, like Babylon 5's CGI was only rendered 4:3, SO, by being full frame (4:3) instead of widescreen 16:9, what we get with the Crusade set is 100% of the CGI, not top & bottom cropped and enlarged CGI, with the artifacts the cropping and enlarging introduces.  I WISH they'd have done the Babylon 5 Season Sets this way.With the Crusade DVDs, they FINALLY did the RIGHT thing, and didn't crop every frame that had any amount of CGI in it (e.g. even a monitor

The crew is made up of Earth Force personnel and civilians, including an archeologist working for IPX and an alien thief who is the last of her kind.Unfortunately, we only ever got thirteen episodes of the show due to creative difference between TNT and JMS.  As such, it's really hard to judge.  Compared to Babylon 5, it seems weak.  But then again, the first thirteen episodes of Babylon 5 are the weakest of that series.  Comparing the two sets of thirteen, these come across as stronger.  I have faith in JMS to say that what we have here is the foundation episodes.  Once we got to know the characters, things would have taken off.  Sets and special effects have gotten an improvement as well, even if many of the larger effects come across as cheap by today's standards.  The tone is slightly different, with more of a horror feel to many of the stories and a darker feeling overall.  The music is a bit odd and doesn't seem to fit, often jarring me out of the episode instead of pulling me in like it did on Babylon 5.This set gives us the thirteen episodes on four DVD's in their original broadcast order.  This isn't the order JMS prefers, and it does cause some continuity issues.  Frankly, I'll take them in any order since the beauty of DVD is I can watch them in the correct order easily.  I was surprised to find the picture full frame.  I don't know if that's all that was available or not, but the picture does seem sharper then the Babylon 5 picture ever was.  Sound is a full surround mix.  Extras on the set are in line with other Babylon 5 releases.  There is a commentary on one episode by members of the cast and crew.  JMS also recorded a commentary on what he wanted the pilot episode to be that gives hints about what would have come had the series continued.  Because Warner Brothers edited it, it won't be on subsequent pressings, so if you want to hear it, get it today.  The final disc has a documentary on the creation of the show (think the intros to seasons on the other sets) and another one on creating the ship itself.This is a hard show for me to watch.  It begins to get traction just as its ending.  And I really want to know how the show would have continued beyond these episodes.  Still, I'm thrilled to have it to complete my collection.",5,A Promising Beginning Never Given a Chance to Grow,1126742400,"09 15, 2005",2005,2797,"['When', 'TNT', 'saved', 'day', 'gave', 'Babylon', '5', 'fifth', 'year', 'also', 'asked', 'JMS', 'movies', 'spin', 'offs', 'result', 'talks', 'was', 'show', 'designed', 'take', 'place', 'movie', 'A', 'CALL', 'TO', 'ARMS.Set', 'five', 'years', 'season', '5', 'ended', 'Earth', 'been', 'hit', 'plague', 'planet', 'quarantined', 'government', 'crew', 'out', 'Excalibur', 'newly', 'complete', 'ship', 'build', 'Minbari', 'help', 'mission', 'explore', 'other', 'worlds', 'hopefully', 'find', 'cure', 'virus', 'life', 'Earth', 'crew', 'made', 'Earth', 'Force', 'personnel', 'civilians', 'including', 'archeologist', 'working', 'IPX', 'alien', 'thief', 'who', 'last', 'kind.Unfortunately', 'only', 'ever', 'got', 'thirteen', 'episodes', 'show', 'due', 'creative', 'difference', 'TNT', 'JMS', 'such', 'really', 'hard', 'judge', 'Compared', 'Babylon', '5', 'weak', 'then', 'again', 'first', 'thirteen', 'episodes', 'Babylon', '5', 'are', 'weakest', 'series', 'Comparing', 'two', 'sets', 'thirteen', 'come', 'stronger', 'have', 'faith', 'JMS', 'say', 'what', 'have', 'here', 'foundation', 'episodes', 'got', 'know', 'characters', 'things', 'would', 'have', 'taken', 'off', 'Sets', 'special', 'effects', 'have', 'gotten', 'improvement', 'as', 'well', 'even', 'many', 'larger', 'effects', 'come', 'cheap', 'today', 'standards', 'tone', 'slightly', 'different', 'more', 'horror', 'feel', 'many', 'stories', 'darker', 'feeling', 'overall', 'music', 'bit', 'odd', ""n't"", 'seem', 'fit', 'often', 'jarring', 'episode', 'instead', 'pulling', 'did', 'Babylon', '5.This', 'set', 'thirteen', 'episodes', 'four', 'DVD', 'original', 'broadcast', 'order', ""n't"", 'order', 'JMS', 'prefers', 'cause', 'continuity', 'issues', 'Frankly', ""'ll"", 'take', 'order', 'beauty', 'DVD', 'can', 'watch', 'correct', 'order', 'easily', 'was', 'surprised', 'find', 'picture', 'full', 'frame', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'available', 'not', 'picture', 'seem', 'sharper', 'then', 'Babylon', '5', 'picture', 'ever', 'was', 'Sound', 'full', 'surround', 'mix', 'Extras', 'set', 'are', 'line', 'other', 'Babylon', '5', 'releases', 'commentary', 'one', 'episode', 'members', 'cast', 'crew', 'JMS', 'also', 'recorded', 'commentary', 'what', 'wanted', 'pilot', 'episode', 'be', 'hints', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'come', 'had', 'series', 'continued', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'edited', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'subsequent', 'pressings', 'so', 'want', 'hear', 'get', 'today', 'final', 'disc', 'documentary', 'creation', 'show', 'think', 'intros', 'seasons', 'other', 'sets', 'one', 'creating', 'ship', 'itself.This', 'hard', 'show', 'watch', 'get', 'traction', 'just', 'ending', 'really', 'want', 'know', 'how', 'show', 'would', 'have', 'continued', 'episodes', 'Still', ""'m"", 'thrilled', 'have', 'complete', 'collection']",Crusade: The Complete Series

855495,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,B00061QJSK,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[39, 41]","In 1999, the creator of the sci-fi TV series ""Babylon 5"", J. Michael Straczynski, produced a 2-hour made-for-TV film entitled ""Babylon 5: A Call To Arms"".  The premise of ""Babylon 5: A Call To Arms"" was that several years following the Shadow War, which was part of the plot of the original ""Babylon 5"" TV series (1994-1998), allies of the departed Shadow race decide to avenge the destruction of the Shadow home world known as Z'ha'dum (pronounced Za'hadoom).  Captain Sheridan (Bruce Boxleitner) becomes aware that Earth is threatened by an imminent attack from the former Shadow allies lead by the reptilian race known as the Drakh, who intend to use a powerful Shadow ""planet-killer"" to destroy Earth.  Captain Sheridan gathers what forces he can to defend Earth, including the use of two prototype warships that utilize Vorlon technology.  One of the prototype warships is destroyed during the attack upon the ""planet-killer"" above Earth, but the Drakh resort to a biological weapon instead that unleashes a deadly virus upon the entire population of Earth.  With few people not infected, Earth decides to use its only remaining Vorlon-inspired warship, named Excalibur, to search for a cure before the virus completely destroys all life on Earth within 5 years.  Hence, the short-lived TV series ""Crusade"" was born in 1999, with the intent of being a 5-year long series about the Excalibur crew's search for the cure.  Unfortunately, creative conflicts between TNT (that TV channel that originally aired the series) and J. Michael Straczynski lead to show's premature cancellation after only 13 episodes.  Also, no other channel had the opportunity of picking up the series in spite of the fact that scripts for three more episodes had been written, but were never filmed.Starring in the ""Crusade"" were Gary Cole as Captain Matthew Gideon, Daniel Dae Kim as John Matheson, David Allen Brooks as Max Eilerson, Peter Woodward as the techno-mage Galen, Marjean Holden as Dr. Sarah Chambers and Carrie Dobro as the alien Dureena Nafeel, who was the only cast member from ""Babylon 5: A Call To Arms"" to have a regular role in ""Crusade"".  Sadly, with only 13 episodes, ""Crusade"" never really had the opportunity to develop into a show of the same caliber as the original ""Babylon 5"".  However, the same wonderful special effects and character development did have a chance to take shape, especially with the mysterious techno-mage Galen.  In order, the 13 hour-long episodes and their original airdates on TNT were as follows:1. ""War Zone"" (6/9/1999)2. ""The Long Road"" (6/16/1999)3. ""The Well of Forever"" (6/23/1999)4. ""The Path of Sorrows"" (6/30/1999)5. ""Patterns of the Soul"" (7/7/1999)6. ""Ruling from the Tomb"" (7/14/1999)7. ""The Rules of the Game"" (7/21/1999)8. ""Appearances and Other Deceits"" (7/28/1999)9. ""Racing the Night"" (8/4/1999)10. ""The Memory of War"" (8/11/1999)11. ""The Needs of Earth"" (8/18/1999)12. ""Visitors from Down the Street"" (8/25/1999)13. ""Each Night I Dream of Home"" (9/1/1999)Of these 13 episodes, the best were ""The Path of Sorrows"", ""Racing the Night"", ""The Memory of War"" and ""Visitors from Down the Street"".  Overall, I rate the short-lived sci-fi TV series ""Crusade"" with 5 out of 5 stars.  It is truly sad that these 13 episodes are all that exist for what could have been a truly wonderful 5-year TV series.",5,"Wonderful, but Short-Lived TV Series Based Upon ""Babylon 5""",1101254400,"11 24, 2004",2004,3340,"['1999', 'creator', 'sci-fi', 'TV', 'series', 'Babylon', '5', 'J.', 'Michael', 'Straczynski', 'produced', '2-hour', 'made-for-TV', 'film', 'entitled', 'Babylon', '5', 'Call', 'Arms', 'premise', 'Babylon', '5', 'Call', 'Arms', 'was', 'several', 'years', 'following', 'Shadow', 'War', 'was', 'part', 'plot', 'original', 'Babylon', '5', 'TV', 'series', '1994-1998', 'allies', 'departed', 'Shadow', 'race', 'decide', 'avenge', 'destruction', 'Shadow', 'home', 'world', 'known', ""Z'ha'dum"", 'pronounced', ""Za'hadoom"", 'Captain', 'Sheridan', 'Bruce', 'Boxleitner', 'aware', 'Earth', 'threatened', 'imminent', 'attack', 'former', 'Shadow', 'allies', 'lead', 'reptilian', 'race', 'known', 'Drakh', 'who', 'intend', 'use', 'powerful', 'Shadow', 'planet-killer', 'destroy', 'Earth', 'Captain', 'Sheridan', 'gathers', 'what', 'can', 'defend', 'Earth', 'including', 'use', 'two', 'prototype', 'warships', 'utilize', 'Vorlon', 'technology', 'One', 'prototype', 'warships', 'destroyed', 'attack', 'planet-killer', 'Earth', 'Drakh', 'resort', 'biological', 'weapon', 'instead', 'deadly', 'virus', 'entire', 'population', 'Earth', 'few', 'people', 'not', 'infected', 'Earth', 'use', 'only', 'remaining', 'Vorlon-inspired', 'warship', 'named', 'Excalibur', 'search', 'cure', 'virus', 'completely', 'life', 'Earth', '5', 'years', 'Hence', 'short-lived', 'TV', 'series', 'Crusade', 'was', 'born', '1999', 'intent', 'being', '5-year', 'long', 'series', 'Excalibur', 'crew', 'search', 'cure', 'Unfortunately', 'creative', 'conflicts', 'TNT', 'TV', 'channel', 'originally', 'aired', 'series', 'J.', 'Michael', 'Straczynski', 'lead', 'show', 'premature', 'cancellation', 'only', '13', 'episodes', 'Also', 'other', 'channel', 'had', 'opportunity', 'picking', 'up', 'series', 'spite', 'fact', 'scripts', 'three', 'more', 'episodes', 'had', 'been', 'written', 'were', 'never', 'filmed.Starring', 'Crusade', 'were', 'Gary', 'Cole', 'Captain', 'Matthew', 'Gideon', 'Daniel', 'Dae', 'Kim', 'John', 'Matheson', 'David', 'Allen', 'Brooks', 'Max', 'Eilerson', 'Peter', 'Woodward', 'techno-mage', 'Galen', 'Marjean', 'Holden', 'Dr.', 'Sarah', 'Chambers', 'Carrie', 'Dobro', 'alien', 'Dureena', 'Nafeel', 'who', 'was', 'only', 'cast', 'member', 'Babylon', '5', 'Call', 'Arms', 'have', 'regular', 'role', 'Crusade', 'Sadly', 'only', '13', 'episodes', 'Crusade', 'never', 'really', 'had', 'opportunity', 'develop', 'show', 'same', 'caliber', 'original', 'Babylon', '5', 'However', 'same', 'wonderful', 'special', 'effects', 'character', 'development', 'did', 'have', 'chance', 'take', 'shape', 'especially', 'mysterious', 'techno-mage', 'Galen', 'order', '13', 'hour-long', 'episodes', 'original', 'airdates', 'TNT', 'were', 'follows:1', 'War', 'Zone', '6/9/1999', '2', 'Long', 'Road', '6/16/1999', '3', 'Well', 'Forever', '6/23/1999', '4', 'Path', 'Sorrows', '6/30/1999', '5', 'Patterns', 'Soul', '7/7/1999', '6', 'Ruling', 'Tomb', '7/14/1999', '7', 'Rules', 'Game', '7/21/1999', '8', 'Appearances', 'Other', 'Deceits', '7/28/1999', '9', 'Racing', 'Night', '8/4/1999', '10', 'Memory', 'War', '8/11/1999', '11', 'Needs', 'Earth', '8/18/1999', '12', 'Visitors', 'Street', '8/25/1999', '13', 'Night', 'Dream', 'Home', '9/1/1999', '13', 'episodes', 'best', 'were', 'Path', 'Sorrows', 'Racing', 'Night', 'Memory', 'War', 'Visitors', 'Street', 'Overall', 'rate', 'short-lived', 'sci-fi', 'TV', 'series', 'Crusade', '5', '5', 'stars', 'truly', 'sad', '13', 'episodes', 'are', 'exist', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'truly', 'wonderful', '5-year', 'TV', 'series']",Crusade: The Complete Series

I remember cruising the nets (mostly bb service back then) for news and tidbits from JMS, the creator of both series.  I remember ""BAM"" episodes versus story-developing episodes.  To say that I'm a B5 fan is a huge understatement.I mention all this to provide context for this review.  It's not necessarily a good thing for a reviewer of a spin-off to simultaneously be a fan of the original series, as expectations will generally be higher than for the general audience.  Nevertheless, here I am.B5 was a true space epic encompassing many overriding plotlines, conspiracies, nuances of character, and psychosocial conundrums.  Crusade has all of these, in their infancy.  We note the barest glint of the underlying arc.  We see the characters developing more than one-dimension.  Sometimes series are cut short when fans know that they could have been great.  With Crusade, it was cut too early to even figure that out.  To paraphrase the increasingly ridiculous Mr. Rumsfeld, Crusade is an ""unknown unknown.""  To newcomers, this may be irrevelant, but to fans it is unbearable.  Anyone who remembers the first time they saw the finale for B5 season three probably also thinks that JMS would have pulled another thriller episode (or 20) out for us.Crusade, as it is, is not great.  The stories seem unconnected, the characters transparent, the plotlines predictable.  Yet most episodes still entertained.  My criticisms are mostly meant for the ""arc"" structure of the series, or lack of it.  Again, this is probably due to the amputation of the series and not from lack of planning.  If enjoyed with an ""episode"" rather than an ""arc"" frame of mind, one will not be disappointed.To summarize, for fans a mixed bag:  familiar occasional forays into corny humor, beginnings of deep characterization, hints of underlying plot, and some familiar characters.  For newcomers:  some episodes with excellent action sequences, mystery aplenty, psychological/spiritual dilemmas, and likeable characters (JMS trademark).If you are new and bored and mildly interested, pick it up, watch it, and forget it.If you are new and bored and very interested, I seriously recommend picking up the complete B5 series plus movie set before watching this.If you are a fan of B5, c'mon guys, resistance is futile, so stop mucking around and buy this, for completeness' sake!Not great, but could (and probably would) have been.

This had to be the worst science-fiction series I have ever seen. The writing was sloppy, story lines confusing and special effects and props/ models very amateurish. The first few episodes were very difficult to get through. They made almost no sense at all. Subsequent episodes smoothed out and started to show some improvement as the characters developed a little, but overall I found it to be a complete waste of time and money.

JMS decided to experiment with some strange and boring music that really didn't fit the show. Ratings had started well and then dropped badly because it is hard to concentrate on the show with such dreadful music.To answer reviewer ""star fire rain"" who disagrees with me about the reasons for cancellation,this show was cancelled due to TNT executives feeling that JMS had not given them what he had promised and a big factor in that is the very lame music. It just doesn't work. Just when they get a dramatic scene,it is ruined by the most lame and lifeless music in the history of television.When the show did air,JMS thought that he could interest someone else(like the Sci-Fi Channel)in taking up the show,but the ratings dropped badly and that chance was gone(again,the lame,flat and very boring music was a factor).Some Crusade fans(like sfr),that think that JMS can do no wrong,may disagree with this but the fact is that the audience was initially there and left. Season one was not the time to experiment and the music was absolutely awful.The special effects vary from reasonable to poor,but the cast are fantastic and the story setup is good. Any fans that blame TNT for the demise of Crusade should remember that they financed the 13 episodes of Crusade,the entire fifth season of Babylon 5,four telemovies and even gave JMS $150,000 to re-edit the B5 pilot. To give such money to re-edit a pilot is unprecedented and shows that he initially had their support.TNT backed Babylon 5 and Crusade to the tune of well over US$40 million and the turning point came when JMS made the mistake of replacing Babylon 5's eccellent composer with a disastrous and musically very different new composer. The result was that Crusade did not match Babylon 5's ratings.JMS then went to the Sci-Fi channel that financed one single episode of his new B5 Rangers show,so by that comparison TNT didn't do so badly.

But even saying that I have to admit that the 5th season was the weakest.  Some fans excuse the weaknesses in Crusade (and JMS as well) by saying ""it was going to be good later on.""  But from a story and character point of view, Crusade did not build on the strengths of Babylon 5 and it ultimately continued the downward slide that began with season 5 of B5.(1) A gloomy concept - humans will be wiped out in 5 years.  Sure JMS now says he would have ""found the cure"" by the end of year 2 but the overall tone of the 1st 13 episode is a downer.  As much as 5b5 of full of war and destruction, there was always an element of hope.(2) Repetitive story lines - how many worlds killed off by mysterious viruses were we going to visit?  In 13 episodes the stories were already retreads.(3) Awful music - I like abstract music and the theme was interesting but the music in the battle scenes is cheesy and often sound like an amateur teen on a synthesizer.(4) Acting - some of the acting was also very amateurish - especially the Fox Mulder/Dana Scully/Cigarette Smoking man wanna-bees?  Why do most aliens have fake English accents and talk as if they are on a bad episode of ""Are you being served?""  And the guy who ""redesigned"" the uniforms was one of the most offensive stereo-type I have seen in modern television.(5) Costumes - No wonder the network requested changes - the gray-red uniforms look like very bad bellboy uniforms from the 1930s.On the plus side, Gary Cole made an interesting lead, the ship was nicely designed, the alien woman/thief had strong possibilities and Elizabeth Lockley was far more interesting here than on B5.

only conclude that Mr.Straczynski's story arc,if he had this in mind, would have definitely come around to meld with the B-5 universe because Crusade,when all said and done,was just a more thoroughly explored extension of Babylon 5 anyways.The minuses to this set are as follows:The set includes very little in the way of extras.Just a few interspersed commentaries and a couple of short featurettes which I am going to watch now that I have finished all the episodes.It is not filmed in widescreen like the majority of B-5 was.The price tag for just 13 eps(and what little is included) is very high....much too high.That's why this set will be bought I think mainly by those who can afford it/and or B-5 compleatists.It is certainly a worthy edition to any B-5 fans' collection.But it is ultimately frustrating to watch knowing even though it widens our scope of the B-5 universe a little more it leaves behind a ton of open ended questions.We can only hope that Mr.Straczynskis' recent ""Lost Tales"" DVD can kick start the B-5 universe up again so hopefully we can get some kind of closure on the Crusade take on things.There's always hope.",4,Crusade-the series that could easily have

After all he was great in those Brady Bunch Movies. Daniel Kim, Peter Woodward and Carrie Dobro all play their roles very well. The doctor played by Marjean Holden has very little performance in the show, David Allen Brooks Character is so so and Tracy Scoggins, reprising her role from B5, is out of place. Not to mention she is listed as starring and is only in 3 episodes. The writing is interesting and the direction is by some B5 Veterans including episodes Directed by Stephen Furst (Vir). With all that said it is still very watchable if you are a B5 fan. But the worst thing in this series is the music. Evan H. Chen's style just isn't for this show. I frequently felt the music would kill an episode. So if you are not a B5 fan this isn't for you. If you are a B5 fan watch for inconsistencies.

The effects are good. The music leaves something to be desired, but I can ignore that pretty easily.One thing that I found helped me a lot in understanding the show is to know that the author intended the episodes to be shown in a specific order, but then the station paying for them insisted that they be re-ordered and that a new pilot episode be created. Because of this, characters occasionally refer to something that hasn't happened yet, and character development seems weird because it no longer progresses in the intended sequence.

It had breeding (""B5""), a built in audience, support from a major studio and a two outstanding performances by Gary Cole and Peter Woodward. Then TNT realized that when audiences tuned into the old ""B5"" show no one stuck around for their other entertainment (gee, I wonder why!). So they withdrew their support, despite the fact that the full season hadn't been completed and after the expense of redesigning the costumes and sets. The show, beyond the pilot, felt disjointed and for good reason--with half the episodes missing from the first season story arc, it was half a story told with major gaps between some.Set after the conclusion of the Shadow War, the Drakh an alien race that served the Shadows, contaminates Earth's atmosphere with a deadly virus that will kill all life on Earth within five years. Captain Gideon (Gary Cole), a Techno Mage (one who uses technology in such a way that it appears almost like magic) named Galen (Woodward)and the crew of the Excalibur must search for a cure. Their first stop is a planet where a Drakh spaceship has crashed after a bruising fight with an Earth destroyer. Excalibur is sent to investigate.While the series could be inconsistent (all the reasons are listed in the next paragraph), it also offered a lot of potential. I have to disagree with those that compare these 13 episodes to the first season of B5 stating that they were of similar quality. No, these 13 episodes, despite gaping narrative holes, are better than the first season of B5. JMS had already set up his universe and it allowed him more time to play with the concepts and characters and that shows from the very first episode of the series. Is it as good as the best two seasons of B5 (seasons 3 & 4)frankly, no but it's a lot better than most of the dreck out there and then some.Luckily, there's life after death for TV shows. The DVD picture quality is exceptionally good although the series isn't presented in widescreen. The soundtrack has been remastered for 5.1 and we get a documentary on the show as well a featurette on the design of the Excalibur. Two audio commentaries are included one featuring two of the actors from the show (Peter Woodward is one of them), director Janet Greek and writer Fiona Avery. Then we JMS' commentary track which, from all accounts, was edited after the fact to prevent him from venting his feelings about the poor way that TNT handled the show.The DVDs are priced a bit high considering what you get but the presentation is handsome. You get all thirteen episodes and the extras spread over four discs with brief descriptions of each episode, writer/director and guest cast on the flaps of the accordian style DVD holder. Hopefully sales will be good enough to convince Warner Brothers not to recast the B5 movie with other actors (JMS and Babylonian Productions are fighting against it). Since its currently in preproduction, it's hard to say who will win out on this one. Hopefully, Warner will see the response that Sci-Fi (when Sci-Fi cancelled ""Farscape"" it was as boneheaded as TNT's decision to cancel this show without giving it a chance) got when they aired the ""Farscape"" concluding movie and allow the production to move forward with the original cast. Either way, fans do have ""Crusade"" and hopefully the B5 movie will tie up all the loose ends.",4,Solid show that was killed before it had chance to blossom,1104451200,"12 31, 2004",2004,3379,"['aborted', 'TV', 'show', 'Crusade', 'had', 'lot', 'going', 'had', 'breeding', 'B5', 'built', 'audience', 'support', 'major', 'studio', 'two', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'Gary', 'Cole', 'Peter', 'Woodward', 'Then', 'TNT', 'realized', 'when', 'audiences', 'tuned', 'old', 'B5', 'show', 'one', 'stuck', 'other', 'entertainment', 'gee', 'wonder', 'why', 'withdrew', 'support', 'fact', 'full', 'season', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'completed', 'expense', 'redesigning', 'costumes', 'sets', 'show', 'pilot', 'felt', 'disjointed', 'good', 'reason', 'episodes', 'missing', 'first', 'season', 'story', 'arc', 'was', 'story', 'told', 'major', 'gaps', 'some.Set', 'conclusion', 'Shadow', 'War', 'Drakh', 'alien', 'race', 'served', 'Shadows', 'Earth', 'atmosphere', 'deadly', 'virus', 'will', 'kill', 'life', 'Earth', 'five', 'years', 'Captain', 'Gideon', 'Gary', 'Cole', 'Techno', 'Mage', 'one', 'who', 'technology', 'such', 'way', 'almost', 'magic', 'named', 'Galen', 'Woodward', 'crew', 'Excalibur', 'must', 'search', 'cure', 'first', 'stop', 'planet', 'where', 'Drakh', 'spaceship', 'crashed', 'bruising', 'fight', 'Earth', 'destroyer', 'Excalibur', 'sent', 'investigate.While', 'series', 'could', 'be', 'inconsistent', 'reasons', 'are', 'listed', 'next', 'paragraph', 'also', 'offered', 'lot', 'potential', 'have', 'disagree', 'compare', '13', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'B5', 'stating', 'were', 'similar', 'quality', 'No', '13', 'episodes', 'gaping', 'narrative', 'holes', 'are', 'better', 'first', 'season', 'B5', 'JMS', 'had', 'already', 'set', 'up', 'universe', 'allowed', 'more', 'time', 'play', 'concepts', 'characters', 'very', 'first', 'episode', 'series', 'as', 'good', 'best', 'two', 'seasons', 'B5', 'seasons', '3', '4', 'frankly', 'lot', 'better', 'most', 'dreck', 'there', 'then', 'some.Luckily', 'life', 'death', 'TV', 'shows', 'DVD', 'picture', 'quality', 'exceptionally', 'good', 'series', ""n't"", 'presented', 'widescreen', 'soundtrack', 'been', 'remastered', '5.1', 'get', 'documentary', 'show', 'as', 'well', 'featurette', 'design', 'Excalibur', 'Two', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'are', 'included', 'one', 'featuring', 'two', 'actors', 'show', 'Peter', 'Woodward', 'one', 'director', 'Janet', 'Greek', 'writer', 'Fiona', 'Avery', 'Then', 'JMS', 'commentary', 'track', 'accounts', 'was', 'edited', 'fact', 'prevent', 'venting', 'feelings', 'poor', 'way', 'TNT', 'handled', 'show.The', 'DVDs', 'are', 'priced', 'bit', 'high', 'considering', 'what', 'get', 'presentation', 'handsome', 'get', 'thirteen', 'episodes', 'extras', 'spread', 'four', 'discs', 'brief', 'descriptions', 'episode', 'writer/director', 'guest', 'cast', 'flaps', 'accordian', 'style', 'DVD', 'holder', 'Hopefully', 'sales', 'will', 'be', 'good', 'enough', 'convince', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'not', 'recast', 'B5', 'movie', 'other', 'actors', 'JMS', 'Babylonian', 'Productions', 'are', 'fighting', 'currently', 'preproduction', 'hard', 'say', 'who', 'will', 'win', 'out', 'one', 'Hopefully', 'Warner', 'will', 'see', 'response', 'Sci-Fi', 'when', 'Sci-Fi', 'cancelled', 'Farscape', 'was', 'as', 'boneheaded', 'TNT', 'decision', 'cancel', 'show', 'giving', 'chance', 'got', 'when', 'aired', 'Farscape', 'concluding', 'movie', 'allow', 'production', 'move', 'forward', 'original', 'cast', 'way', 'fans', 'do', 'have', 'Crusade', 'hopefully', 'B5', 'movie', 'will', 'tie', 'up', 'loose', 'ends']",Crusade: The Complete Series
