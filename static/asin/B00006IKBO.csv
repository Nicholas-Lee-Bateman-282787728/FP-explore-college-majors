716782,A1E9N5FK21NDTD,B00006IKBO,"APIMom1999 ""wolfsky""","[6, 7]","This is a very well done educational (IMHO) DVD.  Elmo DOES become scarted, and your child might be scared a bit while watching it, but fire is scarey and it isn't a bad thing to see Elmo scared.  Maria is there with him all along, and mom or dad should be with the child when first viewing this DVD...we used this as a spring board to talk about good fires (to cook with, fireplaces etc) and bad fires.  Kids even in day cares have fire drills, so they aren't as sheltered as most parents think when it comes to fire. But, having a plan in YOUR home is something that everyone should TAKE time to make.  This DVD helps open the door to conversation, and helps kids not be afraid of the firefighter suits.  A good point is made, the firefighter tells Elmo even if the firefighter looks scarey, he is there to help, and if in a fire go to the firefighter not away.

Well, what it did was show Elmo scared half to death about a fire in which he was a part.  They actually show him shaking and in a lot of fear, something that should not be shown to young toddlers.  They don't understand why Elmo, their hero, is so afraid and it really upsets them.  Why they had to take such a great idea and ruin it is beyond me.  There are ways to teach safety without scaring someone to the point where they cannot hear what you are saying out of fear, which is what happens to Elmo in this video.

716786,A15TNUM2PBS6F0,B00006IKBO,"Ei ""crzybookmoovielover""","[3, 3]","My son is two years old, and He loves this dvd. He requests it by name, and I always sit and watch it with him.  He loves Elmo, the firefighters, and even the ""fillers"" that other reviewers aren't too pleased with.This dvd is for the entire family -- we can all learn something here.While some reviewers think that 2 yrs. old is far too young, I disagree. With repeat viewings, and there have been many of them, my son, realizes that with fire comes the fire fighters who will keep us all safe, warm, and fuzzy -- Sort of like Elmo.Elmo is very scared after the grease fire at Hooper's store. His raw emotion of fear truly chokes me up. Never before has a muppet had such an impact on me or my son.  Frankie, my son, always points out to me, ""he's scared"".  So, not only is he learning fire safety, but he learning emotion and how to figure out how someone is feeling.Then after Firefighter Bill takes Elmo around the firehouse, Frankie is relieved to see Elmo back to his usual cute self, playing with the firetrucks like any other kid.NYFD does an outstanding job helping Sesame Street viewers and residents how to handle the situation should a fire happen.  They were very reassuring and were genuinely concerned about Elmo.I think this is a perfect addition to fans of Elmo, and fans of Fightfighters.  There is a sequence of ""elmo's World"", some other little cartoons and a video with the 3 little pigs and the big bad wolf called, ""get out stay out don't you go back in!""  and little ones get their turn to show us what firefighters wear and how they feel about them.  Mr. Noodles sister comes for a silly visit and figures out what the fighter of the flames must wear to be safe.  Also, a beautiful girl and close friend of Elmo's, Sabrina, shows us all her family's plan in case of fire.My son adores the whole dvd, even the silly Baby bear ""hero Guy"" that the movie ends with.",5,New York's finest & Elmo team up,1045526400,"02 18, 2003",2003,1885,"['son', 'two', 'years', 'old', 'dvd', 'name', 'always', 'sit', 'watch', 'Elmo', 'firefighters', 'even', 'fillers', 'other', 'reviewers', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'pleased', 'with.This', 'dvd', 'entire', 'family', 'can', 'learn', 'something', 'here.While', 'reviewers', 'think', '2', 'yrs', 'old', 'far', 'too', 'young', 'disagree', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'there', 'have', 'been', 'many', 'son', 'fire', 'fire', 'fighters', 'who', 'will', 'keep', 'safe', 'warm', 'fuzzy', 'Sort', 'Elmo.Elmo', 'very', 'scared', 'grease', 'fire', 'Hooper', 'store', 'raw', 'emotion', 'fear', 'truly', 'chokes', 'up', 'Never', 'muppet', 'had', 'such', 'impact', 'son', 'Frankie', 'son', 'always', 'out', 'scared', 'So', 'not', 'only', 'learning', 'fire', 'safety', 'learning', 'emotion', 'how', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'someone', 'feeling.Then', 'Firefighter', 'Bill', 'Elmo', 'firehouse', 'Frankie', 'relieved', 'see', 'Elmo', 'back', 'usual', 'cute', 'self', 'playing', 'firetrucks', 'other', 'kid.NYFD', 'outstanding', 'job', 'helping', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'viewers', 'residents', 'how', 'handle', 'situation', 'should', 'fire', 'happen', 'were', 'very', 'reassuring', 'were', 'genuinely', 'concerned', 'Elmo.I', 'think', 'perfect', 'addition', 'fans', 'Elmo', 'fans', 'Fightfighters', 'sequence', 'elmo', 'World', 'other', 'little', 'cartoons', 'video', '3', 'little', 'pigs', 'big', 'bad', 'wolf', 'called', 'get', 'out', 'stay', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'back', 'little', 'ones', 'get', 'turn', 'show', 'firefighters', 'wear', 'how', 'feel', 'Mr.', 'Noodles', 'sister', 'silly', 'visit', 'out', 'what', 'fighter', 'flames', 'must', 'wear', 'be', 'safe', 'Also', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'close', 'friend', 'Elmo', 'Sabrina', 'family', 'plan', 'case', 'fire.My', 'son', 'whole', 'dvd', 'even', 'silly', 'Baby', 'hero', 'Guy', 'movie']",Elmo Visits the Firehouse VHS
716787,A30GFAPZUBEVB,B00006IKBO,James Cashin,"[15, 15]","What is up with some of you people going on about how awful it is that Elmo is scared in this DVD.  Yeah, he should be.  He is in a restaurant when a FIRE starts.  That is the whole idea here.  Kids should know FIRES are dangerous.  My 3 year old loves firefighters. He has 5 fire trucks, a firefighter outfit, a hose, 3 hats and lots of video/DVDs about firefighters.  He is a firefighteroholic but, he also appreciates that FIRE is very dangerous and not something that's fun and yippee!  On the first viewing of this DVD he turns to me and says, ""Papa, Elmo Scared"", and I tell him, ""Yes he is son because, he is in a restaurant that has a lot of smoke coming out of the kitchen.  And he is not sure what is going on"". On the arrival of FDNY Elmo, still shaking, is slowly reassured that it is ok to be scared about FIRE and that it is also understandable that the firefighters in all their uniforms can be scary as well.  Elmo is then invited back to the firehouse to see what a firefighter does and look at all the gear they need. At the end of the firehouse tour Elmo is no longer scared.  So, if you want a good DVD about the dangers of FIRE and what a child should do when a FIRE starts in their presence this is a great DVD to purchase but, if you want your child to live in a dream world where everything is fun and sweet and good enough to eat, stay away from this DVD.",5,Wake up and smell the SMOKE!,1128643200,"10 7, 2005",2005,1380,"['What', 'up', 'people', 'going', 'how', 'awful', 'Elmo', 'scared', 'DVD', 'Yeah', 'should', 'be', 'restaurant', 'when', 'FIRE', 'whole', 'idea', 'here', 'Kids', 'should', 'know', 'FIRES', 'are', 'dangerous', '3', 'year', 'old', 'firefighters', '5', 'fire', 'trucks', 'firefighter', 'outfit', 'hose', '3', 'hats', 'lots', 'video/DVDs', 'firefighters', 'firefighteroholic', 'also', 'FIRE', 'very', 'dangerous', 'not', 'something', 'fun', 'yippee', 'first', 'viewing', 'DVD', 'Papa', 'Elmo', 'Scared', 'tell', 'Yes', 'son', 'because', 'restaurant', 'lot', 'smoke', 'coming', 'kitchen', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'going', 'arrival', 'FDNY', 'Elmo', 'still', 'shaking', 'slowly', 'reassured', 'ok', 'be', 'scared', 'FIRE', 'also', 'understandable', 'firefighters', 'uniforms', 'can', 'be', 'scary', 'well', 'Elmo', 'then', 'invited', 'back', 'firehouse', 'see', 'what', 'firefighter', 'look', 'gear', 'need', 'end', 'firehouse', 'tour', 'Elmo', 'no', 'longer', 'scared', 'So', 'want', 'good', 'DVD', 'dangers', 'FIRE', 'what', 'child', 'should', 'do', 'when', 'FIRE', 'starts', 'presence', 'great', 'DVD', 'purchase', 'want', 'child', 'live', 'dream', 'world', 'where', 'everything', 'fun', 'sweet', 'good', 'enough', 'eat', 'stay', 'away', 'DVD']",Elmo Visits the Firehouse VHS
