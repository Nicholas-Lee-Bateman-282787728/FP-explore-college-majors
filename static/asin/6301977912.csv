Located about 80 miles from Tucson in the San Rafael Valley, the owner at the time was a very nervous lady called Mrs. Sharp. I remember the first time I took Blake Edwards and his entourage there (which included his wife, Julie Andrews)to see if it could work for the film and get permission from Mrs. Sharp. She and I had been good friends for awhile since I had used her place before in films. During the meeting, she ask me to go to the kitchen with her. We sat at her table and had coffee, while all these important people sat patiently in her living room. She finally said, ""I don't like these people"". I almost panicked. Then I got an idea. I took her to the door and asked her peek through the little window and said, ""Do you realize that's Mary Poppin's sitting there?"" Of course, that changed her mind and they talked a long time and became fast friends. A great western movie that I hope someday is put on DVD.",4,Wild Rovers,1225756800,"11 4, 2008",2008,1020,"['was', 'location', 'manager', 'project', 'big', 'ranch', 'house', 'same', 'one', 'used', 'McLintock', 'Located', '80', 'miles', 'Tucson', 'San', 'Rafael', 'Valley', 'owner', 'time', 'was', 'very', 'nervous', 'lady', 'called', 'Mrs.', 'Sharp', 'remember', 'first', 'time', 'took', 'Blake', 'Edwards', 'entourage', 'included', 'wife', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'see', 'could', 'work', 'film', 'get', 'permission', 'Mrs.', 'Sharp', 'had', 'been', 'good', 'friends', 'awhile', 'had', 'used', 'place', 'films', 'meeting', 'ask', 'go', 'kitchen', 'sat', 'table', 'had', 'coffee', 'important', 'people', 'sat', 'patiently', 'living', 'room', 'finally', 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'people', 'almost', 'panicked', 'Then', 'got', 'idea', 'took', 'door', 'asked', 'peek', 'little', 'window', 'said', 'Do', 'realize', 'Mary', 'Poppin', 'sitting', 'there', 'course', 'changed', 'mind', 'talked', 'long', 'time', 'became', 'fast', 'friends', 'great', 'western', 'movie', 'hope', 'someday', 'put', 'DVD']",N/A

287043,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,6301977912,Randy Keehn,"[9, 13]","I watched ""The Wild Rovers"" last night mainly because I have always enjoyed the acting of William Holden (as well as Karl Malden who also plays a major role in the movie).  Holden has such a quick, yet (by American standards) articulate delivery that he sounds like an effusive Bob Hope in a dramatic role.  He has made every movie I've seen him in better because of his presence in the cast.  Sometimes, however, the structure of the movie fails to support the quality of the cast.  For me, the problems with ""The Wild Rovers"" is not Holden or any of the actors; it's Blake Edwards.What ""The Wild Rovers"" lacks is a coherant story.  There is a scene about two thirds into the movie when there is a gun battle.  Holden enters the fray late only knowing one person in the fight.  He sees the bartender with a gun in his hand and promptly shoots him dead.  Why he did so is never really explored or explained (although other characters in the movie commented on the pointlessness of the act).  For all we know, the bartender hadn't taken sides and was seemingly trying to restore the peace.  The scene is instructive of the movie because there are many other people and events in the movie that go unexplained.  The background of the two main characters goes largely unexplained.  Well, so what?  Except that there is a scene in which Holden marvels at how two such different people became friends.  Outside of the age difference, we pretty much have to guess for ourselves as to what else is different about them.  There's a conflict between sheepmen and cattlemen which is rather historic during a period of Western history.  However, we could use at least a weak explanation as to why that is an issue istead of just accepting the hatred we find.  The relationships between father and sons are ripe for exploration but we only see the results.  On and on we get scenes and situations that look good on film but don't seem to relate to everything else we're watching.  Maybe the answer was on the cutting room floor.  After all, I understand that Edwards had to cut about 20 minutes off the original film.  However, blaming the film editor is like shooting the bartender.",3,Don't Shoot the Piano Player,1125360000,"08 30, 2005",2005,2171,"['watched', 'Wild', 'Rovers', 'last', 'night', 'mainly', 'have', 'always', 'enjoyed', 'acting', 'William', 'Holden', 'as', 'well', 'Karl', 'Malden', 'who', 'also', 'major', 'role', 'movie', 'Holden', 'quick', 'yet', 'American', 'standards', 'articulate', 'delivery', 'effusive', 'Bob', 'Hope', 'dramatic', 'role', 'made', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'better', 'presence', 'cast', 'Sometimes', 'however', 'structure', 'movie', 'support', 'quality', 'cast', 'problems', 'Wild', 'Rovers', 'not', 'Holden', 'actors', 'Blake', 'Edwards.What', 'Wild', 'Rovers', 'coherant', 'story', 'scene', 'two', 'thirds', 'movie', 'when', 'gun', 'battle', 'Holden', 'fray', 'late', 'only', 'knowing', 'one', 'person', 'fight', 'bartender', 'gun', 'hand', 'promptly', 'shoots', 'dead', 'Why', 'did', 'so', 'never', 'really', 'explored', 'explained', 'other', 'characters', 'movie', 'commented', 'pointlessness', 'act', 'know', 'bartender', 'had', ""n't"", 'taken', 'sides', 'was', 'seemingly', 'trying', 'restore', 'peace', 'scene', 'instructive', 'movie', 'are', 'many', 'other', 'people', 'events', 'movie', 'go', 'unexplained', 'background', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'largely', 'unexplained', 'Well', 'what', 'scene', 'Holden', 'marvels', 'how', 'two', 'such', 'different', 'people', 'became', 'friends', 'age', 'difference', 'pretty', 'much', 'have', 'guess', 'what', 'else', 'different', 'conflict', 'sheepmen', 'cattlemen', 'rather', 'historic', 'period', 'Western', 'history', 'However', 'could', 'use', 'least', 'weak', 'explanation', 'why', 'issue', 'istead', 'just', 'accepting', 'hatred', 'find', 'relationships', 'father', 'sons', 'are', 'ripe', 'exploration', 'only', 'see', 'results', 'get', 'scenes', 'situations', 'look', 'good', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'relate', 'everything', 'else', ""'re"", 'watching', 'Maybe', 'answer', 'was', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'understand', 'Edwards', 'had', 'cut', 'about', '20', 'minutes', 'original', 'film', 'However', 'blaming', 'film', 'editor', 'shooting', 'bartender']",N/A

We really care for that middle aged cowboy and his tender friendship with the young man Ryan O'Neal. Together, they pass throw challenges after robbing a bank, including a scene with a dog, and most important the slowmotion use in the horse scene.The curious thing is that we see two different points of view: from the main characters and from the law men chasing them leaded by Karl Malden. In fact, Malden with his wife seems to be a person a bit far away from the story of the mov.The mov also stars younger Tom Skeritt and Joe Don Baker, Moses Gunn and a yelling Rachel Roberts.Pretty good western, and I'm not a western fan.",4,One of the best westerns ever,1038960000,"12 4, 2002",2002,896,"['RATING-', '7.6I', ""'ve"", 'just', 'watched', 'one', 'last', 'night', 'quite', 'impresssive', 'western', 'Blake', 'Edwards', 'king', 'Pink', 'Phanter.Spite', 'vulgar', 'screenplay', 'characters', 'view', 'fascinating', 'specially', 'William', 'Holden', 'usual', 'cynical', 'presence', 'really', 'care', 'middle', 'aged', 'cowboy', 'tender', 'friendship', 'young', 'man', 'Ryan', ""O'Neal"", 'Together', 'pass', 'throw', 'challenges', 'robbing', 'bank', 'including', 'scene', 'dog', 'most', 'important', 'slowmotion', 'use', 'horse', 'scene.The', 'curious', 'thing', 'see', 'two', 'different', 'points', 'view', 'main', 'characters', 'law', 'men', 'chasing', 'leaded', 'Karl', 'Malden', 'fact', 'Malden', 'wife', 'be', 'person', 'bit', 'far', 'away', 'story', 'mov.The', 'mov', 'also', 'younger', 'Tom', 'Skeritt', 'Joe', 'Don', 'Baker', 'Moses', 'Gunn', 'yelling', 'Rachel', 'Roberts.Pretty', 'good', 'western', ""'m"", 'not', 'western', 'fan']",N/A
287045,AXHCIHVT92GYF,6301977912,The CinemaScope Cat,"[6, 6]","Two cowboys, a fifty-ish cowpoke (William Holden) and a 20 something kid (Ryan O'Neal), decide to break away from the ranch where they work and rob a bank and then head for Mexico. But the indignant ranch owner (Karl Malden) vows to track them down and bring them to justice at all costs. One can see what director Blake Edwards is trying to do but he just can't make it work. To be fair, the film was reputedly altered by MGM against Edwards' wishes. But based on what we have, I'm not sure it would have worked anyway. The film seems a patchwork from other better westerns. There's the male bonding between the two leads taken from the Howard Hawks westerns, the comedic barroom brawls from the John Ford westerns, the slow motion violence of the Sam Peckinpah westerns, the brooding resignation of the Anthony Mann westerns etc. The craggy faced Holden seems born to the saddle but O'Neal comes across as too Malibu for the Old West. The handsome wide screen exteriors (including Monument Valley where Ford shot many of his classic westerns) are by Philip Lathrop (THEY SHOOT HORSES DON'T THEY?) and there's an excellent score by Jerry Goldsmith. With Tom Skerritt, Rachel Roberts, Joe Don Baker, Lynn Carlin, Leora Dana, Moses Gunn and James Olson.The Warners Archive MOD DVD is a decent wide screen (2.35) transfer and includes the film's overture, intermission, entr'acte and exit music.",4,Uneven and perhaps undervalued western,1333324800,"04 2, 2012",2012,1393,"['Two', 'cowboys', 'fifty-ish', 'cowpoke', 'William', 'Holden', '20', 'something', 'kid', 'Ryan', ""O'Neal"", 'decide', 'break', 'away', 'ranch', 'where', 'work', 'rob', 'bank', 'then', 'head', 'Mexico', 'indignant', 'ranch', 'owner', 'Karl', 'Malden', 'track', 'down', 'bring', 'justice', 'costs', 'One', 'can', 'see', 'what', 'director', 'Blake', 'Edwards', 'trying', 'do', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'work', 'be', 'fair', 'film', 'was', 'reputedly', 'altered', 'MGM', 'Edwards', 'wishes', 'based', 'what', 'have', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'anyway', 'film', 'patchwork', 'other', 'better', 'westerns', 'male', 'bonding', 'two', 'leads', 'taken', 'Howard', 'Hawks', 'comedic', 'barroom', 'brawls', 'John', 'Ford', 'slow', 'motion', 'violence', 'Sam', 'Peckinpah', 'brooding', 'resignation', 'Anthony', 'Mann', 'etc', 'craggy', 'faced', 'Holden', 'born', 'saddle', ""O'Neal"", 'too', 'Malibu', 'Old', 'West', 'handsome', 'wide', 'screen', 'exteriors', 'including', 'Monument', 'Valley', 'where', 'Ford', 'shot', 'many', 'classic', 'westerns', 'are', 'Philip', 'Lathrop', 'THEY', 'SHOOT', 'HORSES', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'THEY', 'excellent', 'score', 'Jerry', 'Goldsmith', 'Tom', 'Skerritt', 'Rachel', 'Roberts', 'Joe', 'Don', 'Baker', 'Lynn', 'Carlin', 'Leora', 'Dana', 'Moses', 'Gunn', 'James', 'Olson.The', 'Warners', 'Archive', 'MOD', 'DVD', 'decent', 'wide', 'screen', '2.35', 'transfer', 'film', 'overture', 'intermission', ""entr'acte"", 'exit', 'music']",N/A
