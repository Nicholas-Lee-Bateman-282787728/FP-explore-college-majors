You won't be familiar with the actors and actresses. But it doesn't matter. Some reviews complain about this movie using cliches and stereotypes. Yeah, it does. That's the whole point. The story is all about cliches and stereotypes -- not to convey some serious message or life lesson about them, but just to show how silly they are. It's very tongue-in-cheek. It also pokes fun at the social caste system at work in small towns in the South. Unless you've actually lived in a town like this, you won't recognize it, but take my word for it, people like this do exist, although they are played as caricatures here -- on purpose. At one point in the film, a flamboyant gay character tells one of the town's society matrons that everyone in town is turning gay because of something ""in the water."" He's making a joke, but the matron takes him seriously. Please don't be like that matron. Don't take this movie seriously. Just enjoy the light-hearted fun of it, and the sexiness of the two leading ladies. If you do, then in the words of Grace (Teresa Garrett), ""You're going to like it.""

I read this was the first film Kelli Herd made so I'm impressed.  I think it was done well for a first effort.  There's nothing extravagant about it and the actors seem to be local Texas talent but they do a great job.  The only actor who bothered me a bit was the male lead whose delivery seemed flat most of the time.  The dialogue between the women felt authentic and the relationship didn't feel rushed.  Aspects of it hit home for me personally.  I have to admit the male couple got short shrift on quality dialogue but I think there was meant to be a lot of tongue-in-cheek southern small town silliness and they tended to get more of it.  I commend the ladies and/or the director for the tactile nature of their relationship which I think is missing in a lot of other lesbian films where touching only seems to occur in love scenes.  There is a very funny exchange near the end of the film I won't spoil for you but I have to share another I loved because it's so real and we've all heard something like it at some point, ""Do I have anyone interested in helping me with the Lord's work?""...

The two main characters Alexandra and Mark deal with accepting their homosexuality and living their lives honestly in a small town that is full of homophobes.  Alex is married but has not had sex with her husband in months, and really doesn't even talk to him anymore.  Alex's life is shaken up when she runs into an old school friend, Grace, who was beaten up by her husband, who is now in jail, because she was having an affair with another woman.  Alex was basically raised to be a &quot;little woman&quot; kind of wife--she obviously never questioned her sexuality before, until Grace tells her that she is a Lesbian.  It was really good to see Alex defy her mother and her husband who were both determined to try to &quot;keep her in her place.&quot;  When Alex tells her husband that she has a job and he forbids her to take it I thought I was watching a movie that was set back in the Stone Age.Mark, on the other hand, has known that he is gay ever since he was a teenager, but he is attending a group that is supposed to turn its members into &quot;ex-gays.&quot;  He meets a man,Tomas,at the &quot;homo-no-mo group&quot; because Tomas ended up there on accident.  Mark is immediately attracted to Tomas, and he just cannot seem to help himself because he starts pursuing a relationship with him.After Mark and Alex decide to accept their homosexuality, and live an openly gay lifestyle, they spend the rest of the movie dealing with the problems that this causes--although Alex has much more serious problems because she is married while Mark only has a girlfriend that he was never very interested in.This movie is so heartwarming and beautiful, that I know I will enjoy watching this movie again and again, I am so happy to have this movie.",5,This is a beautiful movie.,986428800,"04 5, 2001",2001,1784,"['absolutely', 'movie', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'Alexandra', 'Mark', 'deal', 'accepting', 'homosexuality', 'living', 'lives', 'honestly', 'small', 'town', 'full', 'homophobes', 'Alex', 'married', 'not', 'had', 'sex', 'husband', 'months', 'really', ""n't"", 'even', 'talk', 'anymore', 'Alex', 'life', 'shaken', 'up', 'when', 'old', 'school', 'friend', 'Grace', 'who', 'was', 'beaten', 'up', 'husband', 'who', 'now', 'jail', 'was', 'having', 'affair', 'woman', 'Alex', 'was', 'basically', 'raised', 'be', 'quot', 'little', 'woman', 'quot', 'kind', 'wife', 'obviously', 'never', 'questioned', 'sexuality', 'Grace', 'Lesbian', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'see', 'Alex', 'defy', 'mother', 'husband', 'who', 'were', 'determined', 'try', 'quot', 'keep', 'place.', 'quot', 'When', 'Alex', 'husband', 'job', 'take', 'thought', 'was', 'watching', 'movie', 'was', 'set', 'back', 'Stone', 'Age.Mark', 'other', 'hand', 'known', 'gay', 'ever', 'was', 'teenager', 'attending', 'group', 'supposed', 'turn', 'members', 'quot', 'ex-gays.', 'quot', 'man', 'Tomas', 'quot', 'homo-no-mo', 'group', 'quot', 'Tomas', 'ended', 'up', 'there', 'accident', 'Mark', 'immediately', 'attracted', 'Tomas', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'seem', 'help', 'pursuing', 'relationship', 'him.After', 'Mark', 'Alex', 'decide', 'accept', 'homosexuality', 'live', 'openly', 'gay', 'lifestyle', 'spend', 'rest', 'movie', 'dealing', 'problems', 'Alex', 'much', 'more', 'serious', 'problems', 'married', 'Mark', 'only', 'girlfriend', 'was', 'never', 'very', 'interested', 'in.This', 'movie', 'so', 'heartwarming', 'beautiful', 'know', 'will', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'movie', 'again', 'again', 'am', 'so', 'happy', 'have', 'movie']",N/A

195236,AL5OEDM8TPTKV,1884190367,James Hiller,"[10, 13]","Independent movies, by their nature, aren't meant to be big Hollywood blockbusters. The reason they are so popular is that they concentrate on the depth of characters rather than a bunch of mind-numbing special effects or a big movie star. Certainly nowadays, independent cinema has imporved tremendously in all arenas. It's in the Water is typical of that independent film made truly independently.Made and directed lovingly by Kelli Herd, It's in the Water tells the story of Alex Stratton, trapped in a loveless marriage due to the expectations of her family and the town she lives in. Reacquianted with her old best friend Grace Miller, she begins to question herself and who she is. Herd throws into the mix a crazy cast of characters, from a domineering mother Lily, to glorious drag queens, all adds up to a film that's both fun and heartwarming.Offering a more inclusive story, Herd includes men coming out on their own terms as well. Mark Anderson is a man struggling with coming to terms with his homosexuality and attends a hilarious group ""Homo No Mo"" group, only to meet the incredibly sexy Tomas, a painter with a heart of gold. Both Derrick Sanders and timothy Vahle should be commended on their honest and touching portrayal of two men coming out and into each others arms. I liked seeing a ""lesbian film"" more inclusive; a route more ""gay men"" films need to do as well.Herd manages to tackle with her short hundred minutes of film the insanity of small town thinking, ex-gay ministry groups, religious hypocrisy, and AIDS. She manages to do it without the usual preachiness and brow beating that this film could have become. By keeping the film from becoming too serious, the messages hit home more strongly. By the end of the film, with it's absolutely stunning choir rendition of ""I'll Fly Away"" sung by the Marsalis Avenue Church of Christ Choir, you are carried away with everyone as well.Especially fun on the DVD was listening to the commentary track done by Ms. Herd, and the films two stars, Keri Jo Chapman and Teresa Garrett.

Hate to say it, but it's true.The third (and probably the most reaslistic) - it's an endearing enough idea that could have been better had the budget been there to hire someone to write a better script to be performed by better actors (perhaps some who are actually gay instead of beautiful straight women who seem more like they're experimenting than actually coming to terms with their sexual orientation).

In all honesty, I was prepared to be disappointed,  but It's In The Water is the most pleasantly surprising film that I have  watched in a very long time.  Despite the rather absurd premise regarding  the hazards of the town's drinking water, the writing is funny and clever  in the way it illustrates the narrow-minded atmosphere of a small Texas  town.  The acting is somewhat forced and at times falls flat, but the  characters are well developed, albeit more than a little stereotypical.

195256,A33886JPGH56OJ,1884190367,"Shelia W Frances ""Shelia""","[0, 0]","""It's In The Water"" is a light-hearted, romantic comedy that showcases a small southern community with its expectations of behavior grappling with a new Hospice Center that serves AIDS patients.  The movie, in outlandish ways exemplifies ignorance around AIDS.  That one of the community's most notable families unexpectedly comes face to face with one of its members who falls in love with another womyn, a former community member who is a nurse at the Hospice.  In both heart-warming and heart-breaking ways this movie shows the indomitable human right of love and dignity.I personally enjoyed this movie a great deal even though some of the acting seemed a bit stilted.  Overall, the movie is funny and loving enough that I watch it over and over.  For I have decided I'd rather watch a slightly stilted movie that makes me feel good than a dark, depressing one.

I don't usually write negative reviews but feel in this case its warranted. I thought I would like this movie and to some degree I did. What bothered me was the portrayal of African-Americans in the movie. The roles were stereotypical (i.e., the maid) and they were all overweight and interestingly tall. I was offended and annoyed that in a movie that discussed an issue smothered in discrimination that writers would be so insensitive when portraying characters of color.  I was distracted by this. I don't watch movies about the antebellum south for a reason. I felt like I was watching a movie about slavery, etc. The dialect they used spewed ignorance and a slave mentality. We've come along way. I can only hope this writer is more cognizant of this if another movie is done. No one, white, black or any other race/group, deserves to be portrayed in such a negative light. I might have been able to ignore one character but then I saw two more. I would've given this movie five stars but until writers become more aware I won't. I would have been equally offended if the negative portrayal was of another group.
