Daniel Day Lewis gets my tear soaked award for nailing just what a person with C/P has to endure through life, his speech, movements, 100% accurate, he must have spent a hell of a lot of time with these unfortunate people to master his performance, brilliant!, I have a real soft spot in my heart for those souls that have to struggle through life with a birth defect, it's not easy, I help and bless them.

43293,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0783114729,Andrew Ellington,"[4, 4]","The true story of Christy Brown is one of remarkable strength and courage and one that is sure to warm your heart and lift your soul.  Biopic's tend to shoot for the heart as much as possible; who wants to watch a movie about someone they can't sympathize with; but `My Left Foot' doesn't have to twist facts or reimagine elements of Brown's life in order to earn our affection.`My Left Foot' tells us of Brown's life from the very beginning, starting with his birth, moving through his childhood, adolescence and then eventually adulthood.  Born with cerebral palsy, Christy Brown lived most of his young life regarded as a dunce, a burden on his parents and a laughing stock to the community.  Aside from his devoted mother, who never gave up faith in him, Christy really had no one in his corner.  That is until he discovered that with his left foot he could write, and eventually paint.  This is the remarkable true story of a man who had everything against him yet was able to become more than many people with everything going for them ever become.  This is the story of the painter, the poet, the author; the man Christy Brown.Lacking the glossy Hollywood veneer of many American-Made biopic films today, `My Left Foot' can at times come off like a made-for-television movie.  I think that is just the way a lot of these `British/Irish' movies are shot (except for the marvelous `Once' which is beautifully polished for an independent film) but it appears a little cheap sometimes, grainy and gritty.  It's a small and maybe fickle complaint, but a complaint nonetheless.What never comes across as `TV' quality though, are the powerful performances by the entire cast.  Daniel Day-Lewis has obviously taken the brunt of the praise heaped upon this film, and rightfully so.  His portrayal of Christy is marvelously controlled and delivered with such masterful knowledge and understanding.  He never seems to be acting.  The real star to me though was Brenda Fricker who was so genuine and mesmerizing as Christie's loyally devoted mother.  Without a gimmick to fall back on, Fricker had to work double hard to captivate us while acting alongside Day-Lewis, and she succeeds with flying colors.The rest of the cast does a great job as well.  Ray McAnally is believable as Christy's father, and Fiona Shaw shows considerable warmth as Dr. Eileen Cole, Christy's first real love.  Hugh O'Conor is marvelous as the young Christy, perfectly matching Day-Lewis' mastery of the disease raking through his body.  Lastly I want to mention Ruth McCabe's gentle performance as Mary, the woman who eventually gives her heart to Christy.  She only appears in small scenes spaced throughout the film but she adds such warmth to the film.`My Left Foot' is a beautiful story of love and life and power in all of us to survive.  Christy Brown's life is one to marvel over; his struggles, pains and eventual triumphs all come together to create a wonderful miracle that is so rewarding to witness.",4,The triumph of life and all that is beautiful...,1205798400,"03 18, 2008",2008,2985,"['true', 'story', 'Christy', 'Brown', 'one', 'remarkable', 'strength', 'courage', 'one', 'sure', 'warm', 'heart', 'lift', 'soul', 'Biopic', 'tend', 'shoot', 'heart', 'as', 'much', 'possible', 'who', 'watch', 'movie', 'someone', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sympathize', 'Left', 'Foot', ""n't"", 'have', 'twist', 'facts', 'reimagine', 'elements', 'Brown', 'life', 'order', 'earn', 'affection.', 'Left', 'Foot', 'tells', 'Brown', 'life', 'very', 'beginning', 'starting', 'birth', 'moving', 'childhood', 'adolescence', 'then', 'eventually', 'adulthood', 'Born', 'cerebral', 'palsy', 'Christy', 'Brown', 'lived', 'most', 'young', 'life', 'regarded', 'dunce', 'burden', 'parents', 'laughing', 'stock', 'community', 'Aside', 'devoted', 'mother', 'who', 'never', 'gave', 'up', 'faith', 'Christy', 'really', 'had', 'one', 'corner', 'discovered', 'left', 'foot', 'could', 'write', 'eventually', 'paint', 'remarkable', 'true', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'everything', 'yet', 'was', 'able', 'become', 'more', 'many', 'people', 'everything', 'going', 'ever', 'become', 'story', 'painter', 'poet', 'author', 'man', 'Christy', 'Brown.Lacking', 'glossy', 'Hollywood', 'veneer', 'many', 'American-Made', 'biopic', 'films', 'today', 'Left', 'Foot', 'can', 'times', 'come', 'made-for-television', 'movie', 'think', 'just', 'way', 'lot', 'British/Irish', 'movies', 'are', 'shot', 'marvelous', 'Once', 'beautifully', 'polished', 'independent', 'film', 'little', 'cheap', 'sometimes', 'grainy', 'gritty', 'small', 'maybe', 'fickle', 'complaint', 'complaint', 'nonetheless.What', 'never', 'across', 'TV', 'quality', 'are', 'powerful', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'obviously', 'taken', 'brunt', 'praise', 'heaped', 'film', 'rightfully', 'so', 'portrayal', 'Christy', 'marvelously', 'controlled', 'delivered', 'such', 'masterful', 'knowledge', 'understanding', 'never', 'be', 'acting', 'real', 'star', 'was', 'Brenda', 'Fricker', 'who', 'was', 'so', 'genuine', 'mesmerizing', 'Christie', 'loyally', 'devoted', 'mother', 'gimmick', 'fall', 'back', 'Fricker', 'had', 'work', 'double', 'hard', 'captivate', 'acting', 'alongside', 'Day-Lewis', 'flying', 'colors.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'great', 'job', 'as', 'well', 'Ray', 'McAnally', 'believable', 'Christy', 'father', 'Fiona', 'Shaw', 'considerable', 'warmth', 'Dr.', 'Eileen', 'Cole', 'Christy', 'first', 'real', 'love', 'Hugh', ""O'Conor"", 'marvelous', 'young', 'Christy', 'perfectly', 'matching', 'Day-Lewis', 'mastery', 'disease', 'raking', 'body', 'Lastly', 'want', 'mention', 'Ruth', 'McCabe', 'gentle', 'performance', 'Mary', 'woman', 'who', 'eventually', 'heart', 'Christy', 'only', 'small', 'scenes', 'spaced', 'film', 'such', 'warmth', 'film.', 'Left', 'Foot', 'beautiful', 'story', 'love', 'life', 'power', 'survive', 'Christy', 'Brown', 'life', 'one', 'marvel', 'over', 'struggles', 'pains', 'eventual', 'triumphs', 'come', 'together', 'create', 'wonderful', 'miracle', 'so', 'rewarding', 'witness']",My Left Foot

43296,ANGH6401L9Y0T,0783114729,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[2, 2]","Based on a true story, Daniel Day Lewis plays Christy Brown, an Irishman with cerebral palsy who was thought to be mentally retarded until he was 10 and managed to write the word ""mother"" on the floor in chalk using his left foot. It was the only part of him over which he had good control. Eventually he learned to draw and paint with his left foot, and finally to type on an electric typewriter. He then wrote his autobiography, titled the same as the movie, which was illustrated with his own paintings.Much of the credit for his developing articulate (or reasonably so) speech should go to Dr. Eileen Cole (Fiona Shaw), who was just starting up a therapy program for patients with CP. But when Christie agreed to go there, he discovered that all the other students were children, while he was an adult by that time. So Dr. Cole came to his house and worked with him, eventually getting him to practice the ""to be or not to be"" speech from Hamlet as diction exercise. She was also the one who introduced an art gallery owner to his paintings, which were very successful.Unfortunately, Christie fell in love with her and was therefore pretty devastated when she told him she was marrying the art gallery owner. He drank way too much and got completely out of control at the restaurant where they were supposedly celebrating the success of the opening of his show at the gallery.The story is told through flash-backs from his book. While the nurse assigned to stay with him while waiting to be presented at a fund-raiser for ""the crippled kids,"" as Christie put it, read his book, we see what she is reading.Daniel Day Lewis was superb in the role. Like Leo DiCaprio in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape?,"" we can simply see the character as if the actor actually had the handicap he portrayed.

The movie opens with Brown (played by Daniel Day-Lewis) being honored at a cerebral palsy dinner, and then reverts to flashbacks as his life story unfolds. The film traces his life from childhood - his large family (caring mother, doltish father), kid friends, girls.He then meets a nurse (Fiona Shaw) who helps him greatly and with whom he falls in love. She marries another, however, and he hits the bottle. But at the dinner he meets Mary (Ruth McCabe) and they hit it off. The text of Brown's autobiography has been very well scripted - it contains just the right combination of sentimentality and realism.

Anderson,"[63, 68]","This is an amazingly good movie, and film performances don't get any more compelling than those delivered here by Daniel Day-Lewis and Brenda Fricker.  Day-Lewis's portrayal of Christy Brown and his handicap is so  convincing that it is difficult to believe that Day-Lewis is not actually  stricken with Cerebral Palsy.  But his portrayal, like the Irish writer and  artist he portrays, gets far beyond the physical challenges of the disease.  He conveys a warmth, humor, and human intensity that avoids cloying  sentimentality. In terms of the movie content, I can only echo the  superlatives of the previous reviewers.  The film itself deserves 5+  stars.Unfortunately, the DVD transfer is not what I had hoped for. The  picture is not noticeably better than on VHS.  It is not particularly clear  or vivid, and the red hues bleed a bit (like on an aging VHS tape). Perhaps  most distracting, there are specks of dirt visible on the image  (particularly in light areas, like sky), and there are dust and lint  artifacts throughout the transfer. I don't know if all of these flaws were  part of the original, master copy, but it looks like they just made a quick  transfer from a film copy they had handy. It's a shame that such a fine  movie, which won 2 Academy Awards, did not merit more care in the transfer  to DVD.In short, this a triumphant movie that merits seeing (and  owning).

43304,A103KNDW8GN92L,0783114729,David Hugaert,"[0, 1]","""My Left Foot"" is a well-detailed biography of author, writer & artist Christy Brown, born with athetoid cerebral palsy. Brown's life story is told in flashback form & is documented in detailed fashion; centering around Christy's struggle of dealing with the severity of his physical condition while, through the support of his loving & caring family (which included some 22 siblings in all, with thirteen siblings surviving), making himself rather well-known as an outstanding writer, painter & poet. Christy Brown was never regarded as a man trapped inside a prison of a twisted, contorted body, but as a man who could show an entire universe just exactly what he became capable of doing - giving an abundance of love, hope & faith through the genius of his talents. From boyhood (when Christy first snatched a piece of chalk from his sister's hand using his only mobile foot) to manhood (when Christy turned the world on its collective ear by never saying never & refusing to give up in spite of his condition, letting his masterworks speak for themselves), Brown's life is a worthwhile journey, & everyone, disabled or not, can profit from his experiences. With so much to offer, it's not hard to see why ""My Left Foot""'s two main actors (Daniel Day-Lewis & Brenda Fricker) received Academy Award nominations for their outstanding work in one of the best movies of 1989. After seeing this film several times now, I often wonder why Hugh O'Conor's performance (as the young Christy) became overlooked, & didn't garner him any major hardware as a result. As a result of Day-Lewis' potrayal as the adult Christy, it was quite amusing that many people were convinced that the otherwise healthy actor himself had cerebral palsy. In fact, I believe it was through Day-Lewis' commitment & dedication to the role (even refusing to come out of character & eating lunch in a wheelchair) is a major reason why he earned that well-deserved Academy Award. Not at all far behind Day-Lewis & Fricker's performances, is the wonderfully touching portrayal by Ray McAnally (who died shortly after filming ended) as Christy's tough-as-nails father Paddy Brown. In conclusion, if everyone followed Christy Brown's example that he lived by in his forty-nine years spent on earth, the world would be a much better place in which to live. As for the features in this Special Edition DVD release, the reviews are a good read & the interviews are insightful. It would have been a real treat if Daniel Day-Lewis himself had been present in this Special Edition to give his account on Christy Brown's life story.

It is amazing how much he throws himself in each of the characters he plays making them real.I remember, many years ago, we had a party in our house - the friends came over, we were sitting around the table, eating, drinking the wine, talking, laughing - having a good time. The TV was on - there was a movie which we did not pay much attention to. Then, suddenly, all of us stopped talking and laughing. The glasses did not clink, the forks did not move, the food was getting cold on the plates. We could not take our eyes off the screen where the young crippled man whose entire body was against him and who only had a control over his left foot, picked up a piece of chalk with his foot and for what seemed the eternity tried to write just one word on the floor. When he finished writing that one word, we all knew that we had witnessed not one but three triumphs - the triumph of a human will and spirit, the triumph of the cinema which was able to capture the moment like this on the film, and the triumph of an actor who did not act but who became his character.Jim Sheridan's ""My Left Foot"" is an riveting, unsentimental bio-drama about Christy Brown, the man who was born with cerebral palsy in a Dublin slum; who became an artist and a writer and who found a love of his life.I like every one of Day Lewis's performances (I have mixed feelings about his performance in GONY) but I believe that his greatest role was Christy Brown in ""My Left Foot"".",5,One of the greatest screen performances,1172534400,"02 27, 2007",2007,1537,"['Daniel', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'one', 'best', 'actors', 'time', 'one', 'favorites', 'amazing', 'how', 'much', 'characters', 'making', 'real.I', 'remember', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'had', 'party', 'house', 'friends', 'came', 'over', 'were', 'sitting', 'table', 'eating', 'drinking', 'wine', 'talking', 'laughing', 'having', 'good', 'time', 'TV', 'was', 'was', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'pay', 'much', 'attention', 'Then', 'suddenly', 'stopped', 'talking', 'laughing', 'glasses', 'did', 'not', 'clink', 'forks', 'did', 'not', 'move', 'food', 'was', 'getting', 'cold', 'plates', 'could', 'not', 'take', 'eyes', 'screen', 'where', 'young', 'crippled', 'man', 'entire', 'body', 'was', 'who', 'only', 'had', 'control', 'left', 'foot', 'picked', 'up', 'piece', 'chalk', 'foot', 'what', 'seemed', 'eternity', 'tried', 'write', 'just', 'one', 'word', 'floor', 'When', 'finished', 'writing', 'one', 'word', 'knew', 'had', 'witnessed', 'not', 'one', 'three', 'triumph', 'human', 'will', 'spirit', 'triumph', 'cinema', 'was', 'able', 'capture', 'moment', 'film', 'triumph', 'actor', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'act', 'who', 'became', 'character.Jim', 'Sheridan', 'Left', 'Foot', 'riveting', 'unsentimental', 'bio-drama', 'Christy', 'Brown', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'born', 'cerebral', 'palsy', 'Dublin', 'slum', 'who', 'became', 'artist', 'writer', 'who', 'found', 'love', 'life.I', 'one', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'performances', 'have', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'performance', 'GONY', 'believe', 'greatest', 'role', 'was', 'Christy', 'Brown', 'Left', 'Foot']",My Left Foot

Some scenes are very heartwarming, while others are sad and infuriating. The only issues with the story are the limited time spent with these events - in turn, causing them to lose some effectiveness - and the constant time skips - which make the story feel a bit empty, despite going over the significant events in his life. These aren't story breaking problems, just a few minor issues. Daniel Day Lewis gives a stunning performance - it doesn't feel like I'm watching Daniel Day Lewis, it feels like the star of the film IS Christy Brown.

However Day-Lewis is not the one who shines out above the rest, that is done by Brenda Fricker, in a stunningly beautiful performance, one of the greatest I have ever seen done by a female actor, both Fricker and Day-Lewis did above and beyond in their roles, and most defiantly deserved their Oscars.

How the individual deals with these low points will determine what character the individual possess, because any individual can easily sail through the highs.  Some ill-fated have to face harsher and more frequent slumps, which might even be darker and rougher than some could ever imagine.  Yet, they have to persist, and find joy in the small things in life.  The director Jim Sheridan has over the past decade and a half made a handful films about struggle and the essence of how to overcome hardships.  His breakthrough film, My Left Foot, illustrates the biographical struggle of Christy Brown (Daniel Day-Lewis) who suffered from the condition cerebral palsy since birth and the societal ignorance of his condition, which delivers a unique perspective on character and toughness.Through a close-up in the opening the camera gradually pans over a typewriter while a left foot slowly reaches across the typewriter for a vinyl record.  The trembling foot grabs a record between the big toe and the adjacent toe that the foot lifts up towards a record player.  The vinyl record's label have been severely scuffed to the point where the label now is illegible.  After much effort the foot succeeds in placing the record on the turntable, and delicately placing the tonearm with the needle on top of the record.  Shortly after the sound of Mozart's opera Cos&igrave; Fan Tutte begin to flow from the phonograph the audience can imagine the struggle of Christy Brown.  It is a powerful opening that gives an idea of the painstaking efforts that Christy had to experience on a daily basis in order to grow intellectually.Christy's story is not unique in the sense of having Cerebral Palsy, but it becomes an exceptional tale when it begins to disclose how he got to the point where the film opens.  The opening with the foot that switches on the phonograph takes place at least three decades after his birth in 1932 when he acquired his severe condition through a problematic delivery.  When Christy turns on the record player he is preparing himself for a banquet.  However, when Christy arrives to the magnificent mansion of the banquet he is escorted into a secluded room with a nurse (Brenda Fricker) while one of the visitors sneeringly warns the nurse about the Christy.  In seclusion he can listen to the presenter through a speaker while the nurse begins to read the book My Left Foot, which brings the audience back the birth of Christy Brown.As the nurse leafs through the book, flashbacks emerge that reveal who and how Christy arrived to the secluded room in the enormous mansion.  Occasionally, the flashbacks are interrupted by strangers that peek into the room, or by Christy's desire for something such as matches for a smoke.  Nonetheless, the audience learns that Christy's aptitude was discovered when he scribbled something on the floor with a piece of chalk.  There is also a strong presence of Christy's parents and his thirteen siblings in the film, which provided an opportunity for him to be independent.  It is a poignant story, which at time is heart wrenching, as it is very clear what Christy thinks, but the people around him are unable to communicate with him until he displays the ability.  Yet, Christy's cerebral palsy does not deter him from seeking a career to communicate with the world through the arts and literature.Christy might have been close to incapable of creating movement with the exception of his left leg and foot.  Despite this setback he displays the power of the mind in more than one way, as he expresses himself articulately and intelligently while also pushing himself to apply his few physical skills to paint, write, and, yes, soccer.  Daniel Day-Lewis portrays the ability, or perhaps the lack of physical ability, of Christy Brown with a radiant and unforgettable performance.  To balance Day-Lewis' strong performance, as Christy, the audience can observe Brenda Fricker, as the nurse who cares for him in the secluded room, deliver a performance that creates compassion, tension, and affection.  Together with Sheridan's direction these two actors are cast with a large group of talented actors that support Day-Lewis in all parts of the film.  My Left Foot will leave the viewers with an empowering and breathtaking cinematic experience despite generating an unfair view of the world and the difficulties that might wait around the next corner.",5,A Wonderful and Empowering Film About Struggle and Triumph...,1125187200,"08 28, 2005",2005,4514,"['course', 'life', 'will', 'demand', 'toughness', 'effort', 'individual', 'occasionally', 'low', 'points', 'How', 'individual', 'deals', 'low', 'points', 'will', 'determine', 'what', 'character', 'individual', 'possess', 'individual', 'can', 'easily', 'sail', 'highs', 'ill-fated', 'have', 'face', 'harsher', 'more', 'frequent', 'slumps', 'might', 'even', 'be', 'darker', 'rougher', 'could', 'ever', 'imagine', 'have', 'persist', 'find', 'joy', 'small', 'things', 'life', 'director', 'Jim', 'Sheridan', 'past', 'decade', 'half', 'made', 'handful', 'films', 'struggle', 'essence', 'how', 'overcome', 'hardships', 'breakthrough', 'film', 'My', 'Left', 'Foot', 'biographical', 'struggle', 'Christy', 'Brown', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'who', 'suffered', 'condition', 'cerebral', 'palsy', 'birth', 'societal', 'ignorance', 'condition', 'unique', 'perspective', 'character', 'close-up', 'opening', 'camera', 'gradually', 'over', 'typewriter', 'left', 'foot', 'slowly', 'typewriter', 'vinyl', 'record', 'trembling', 'foot', 'grabs', 'record', 'big', 'toe', 'adjacent', 'toe', 'foot', 'up', 'towards', 'record', 'player', 'vinyl', 'record', 'label', 'have', 'been', 'severely', 'scuffed', 'point', 'where', 'label', 'now', 'illegible', 'much', 'effort', 'foot', 'placing', 'record', 'turntable', 'delicately', 'placing', 'tonearm', 'needle', 'top', 'record', 'Shortly', 'sound', 'Mozart', 'opera', 'Cos', 'igrave', 'Fan', 'Tutte', 'begin', 'flow', 'phonograph', 'audience', 'can', 'imagine', 'struggle', 'Christy', 'Brown', 'powerful', 'opening', 'idea', 'painstaking', 'efforts', 'Christy', 'had', 'experience', 'daily', 'basis', 'order', 'grow', 'intellectually.Christy', 'story', 'not', 'unique', 'sense', 'having', 'Cerebral', 'Palsy', 'exceptional', 'tale', 'when', 'disclose', 'how', 'got', 'point', 'where', 'film', 'opening', 'foot', 'phonograph', 'place', 'least', 'three', 'decades', 'birth', '1932', 'when', 'acquired', 'severe', 'condition', 'problematic', 'delivery', 'When', 'Christy', 'record', 'player', 'preparing', 'banquet', 'However', 'when', 'Christy', 'magnificent', 'mansion', 'banquet', 'escorted', 'secluded', 'room', 'nurse', 'Brenda', 'Fricker', 'one', 'visitors', 'sneeringly', 'nurse', 'Christy', 'seclusion', 'can', 'listen', 'presenter', 'speaker', 'nurse', 'read', 'book', 'My', 'Left', 'Foot', 'audience', 'back', 'birth', 'Christy', 'Brown.As', 'nurse', 'leafs', 'book', 'flashbacks', 'emerge', 'reveal', 'who', 'how', 'Christy', 'arrived', 'secluded', 'room', 'enormous', 'mansion', 'Occasionally', 'flashbacks', 'are', 'interrupted', 'strangers', 'peek', 'room', 'Christy', 'desire', 'something', 'such', 'matches', 'smoke', 'Nonetheless', 'audience', 'Christy', 'aptitude', 'was', 'discovered', 'when', 'scribbled', 'something', 'floor', 'piece', 'chalk', 'also', 'strong', 'presence', 'Christy', 'parents', 'thirteen', 'siblings', 'film', 'provided', 'opportunity', 'be', 'independent', 'poignant', 'story', 'time', 'heart', 'wrenching', 'very', 'clear', 'what', 'Christy', 'people', 'are', 'unable', 'communicate', 'ability', 'Christy', 'cerebral', 'palsy', 'not', 'deter', 'seeking', 'career', 'communicate', 'world', 'arts', 'literature.Christy', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'close', 'incapable', 'creating', 'movement', 'exception', 'left', 'leg', 'foot', 'setback', 'power', 'mind', 'more', 'one', 'way', 'articulately', 'intelligently', 'also', 'pushing', 'apply', 'few', 'physical', 'skills', 'paint', 'write', 'yes', 'soccer', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'ability', 'perhaps', 'lack', 'physical', 'ability', 'Christy', 'Brown', 'radiant', 'unforgettable', 'performance', 'balance', 'Day-Lewis', 'strong', 'performance', 'Christy', 'audience', 'can', 'observe', 'Brenda', 'Fricker', 'nurse', 'who', 'secluded', 'room', 'deliver', 'performance', 'compassion', 'tension', 'affection', 'Together', 'Sheridan', 'direction', 'two', 'actors', 'are', 'cast', 'large', 'group', 'talented', 'actors', 'support', 'Day-Lewis', 'parts', 'film', 'Left', 'Foot', 'will', 'leave', 'viewers', 'empowering', 'breathtaking', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'generating', 'unfair', 'view', 'world', 'difficulties', 'might', 'wait', 'next', 'corner']",My Left Foot

Today, it might even be PG-13. Overall, the impact of Christy Brown's story is powerful and inspirational, and the film was obviously a labor of love for all involved. But my one caveat concerns the performance of Day-Lewis. I realize that the man put his heart into this (and won an Oscar for his trouble), and I am a fan, but his performance as Christy is too broadly stroked, it comes off more as a distorted parody of Christie rather than a genuine representation. To me, Day-Lewis did not pitch this performance accurately, and he is obviously over-playing it, trying too hard. In this case, I actually think a less-talented actor would have been better for the role. Which is a shame, because &#34;My Left Foot&#34; is a very good (and now collectible) movie, but it's hampered by this performance. I like good human stories like this, and it's a shame we don't have more gems like this one in the old movie cabinet.As for the Miramax DVD, the extras are good, with a couple of brief documentaries included, and a few reviews from noteworthy critics, such as Pauline Kael who went ape over the film (these are presented as literary--not video--extras, which you can navigate through with your remote). The picture and sound are terrific, and the film is a must-see due to its story. Fortunately, Day-Lewis would come into his own in later years with performances in &#34;There Will be Blood&#34; and &#34;The Age of Innocence&#34;, but here he has yet to find that perfect pitch.

43351,A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB,0783114729,"Sarah ""Eat Dessert First""","[26, 30]","Christy Brown was born to a large Dublin family (he had 13 surviving siblings) in 1932. Born with severe athetoid cerebral palsy, Christy was unable to speak or control his limbs.  At that time, the only course of action was to institutionalize CP children, but Christy's loving family refused to do so, so he grew up as one of the gang: participating in alley football matches, being dragged around town in his wheelbarrow, and included in family dinners. For years, Christy was unable to speak or communicate, until he discovers that he can write with his left foot, the only limb that he can partially control. His mother (Brenda Fricker, who won an Oscar for her performance) loves him with all her heart, but fears that he is retarded as well, until one day, pouring sweat and out of breath from his exertions, he writes ""Mother"" on the floor with a piece of chalk. His family is dumbfounded.Christy progresses to painting with his left foot. As Christy enters adulthood, he meets Dr. Eileen, who wants him to participate at a new cerebral palsy clinic in Dublin. Christy goes once, but is shamed and uncomfortable around so many others like him, and demands to be taken home instead. Dr. Eileen starts making house visits to work with Christy on controlling muscle spasms, breath control, and how to speak more clearly. Christy quickly falls in love with Eileen, attempting to recite and memorize Shakespeare in order to win her love. His mother says darkly, ""There's too much hope in his voice. A broken body doesn't need a broken heart.""Eileen and her fianc&eacute; arrange an exhibition of Christy's paintings, and at a disastrous dinner afterwards, Christy gets stone drunk and makes a scene as Eileen relays her engagement to Peter. ""Congratulations on your wonderful news,"" Christy spits bitterly, sarcastically. ""I'm glad you taught me how to speak so I could say that, Eileen.""After his heartbreak, Christy attempts multiple times to commit suicide, but the continuing love and support of his family keeps him above water, if barely. His parents build him a room of his own where he can paint and write in peace. Christy's father dies soon afterwards, and Christy publishes his autobiography in order to earn money for his family.The movie's narrative structure is unique as well: the film begins with Christy getting ready to go to a benefit, and throughout the film we cut back to the present as he waits to go on, where a nurse reads his autobiography, and back to Christy's past.Daniel Day-Lewis (adult Christy) and Hugh O'Connor (young Christy) are a seamless transition. It is obvious that both spent time in CP clinics observing the behavior, movements and mannerisms of CP patients; they portray Christy with sensitivity and an eye for how difficult the simplest things were for him.This is an incredible movie. After seeing ""Rory O'Shea Was Here,"" another film about CP adults and caregivers (including Brenda Fricker), I wanted to see ""My Left Foot"" for myself after reading so many comparisons.  The Special Edition DVD features several trailers for other Miramax films and a making-of, featuring vintage footage of Christy's family and interviews with his mother. My only disappointment was the terrible transfer quality of the DVD; the film was grainy, with multiple specks of dust and dirt on every frame, and looked more like a worn-out VHS tape. Shame on Miramax for calling this remastered.The film is rated R (profanity, domestic violence, suicide attempts and massive alcohol use).",5,An uplifting tale about living life on one's own terms and overcoming incredible odds....,1127433600,"09 23, 2005",2005,3514,"['Christy', 'Brown', 'was', 'born', 'large', 'Dublin', 'family', 'had', '13', 'surviving', 'siblings', '1932', 'Born', 'severe', 'athetoid', 'cerebral', 'palsy', 'Christy', 'was', 'unable', 'speak', 'control', 'limbs', 'time', 'only', 'course', 'action', 'was', 'institutionalize', 'CP', 'children', 'Christy', 'loving', 'family', 'refused', 'do', 'so', 'grew', 'up', 'one', 'gang', 'participating', 'alley', 'football', 'matches', 'being', 'dragged', 'town', 'wheelbarrow', 'included', 'family', 'dinners', 'years', 'Christy', 'was', 'unable', 'speak', 'communicate', 'can', 'write', 'left', 'foot', 'only', 'limb', 'can', 'partially', 'control', 'mother', 'Brenda', 'Fricker', 'who', 'won', 'Oscar', 'performance', 'heart', 'fears', 'retarded', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'day', 'pouring', 'sweat', 'breath', 'exertions', 'Mother', 'floor', 'piece', 'chalk', 'family', 'dumbfounded.Christy', 'progresses', 'painting', 'left', 'foot', 'Christy', 'enters', 'adulthood', 'Dr.', 'Eileen', 'who', 'participate', 'new', 'cerebral', 'palsy', 'clinic', 'Dublin', 'Christy', 'once', 'shamed', 'uncomfortable', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'demands', 'be', 'taken', 'home', 'instead', 'Dr.', 'Eileen', 'making', 'house', 'visits', 'work', 'Christy', 'controlling', 'muscle', 'spasms', 'breath', 'control', 'how', 'speak', 'more', 'clearly', 'Christy', 'quickly', 'love', 'Eileen', 'attempting', 'recite', 'memorize', 'Shakespeare', 'order', 'win', 'love', 'mother', 'darkly', 'too', 'much', 'hope', 'voice', 'broken', 'body', ""n't"", 'need', 'broken', 'heart', 'Eileen', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'exhibition', 'Christy', 'paintings', 'disastrous', 'dinner', 'afterwards', 'Christy', 'stone', 'drunk', 'scene', 'Eileen', 'engagement', 'Peter', 'Congratulations', 'wonderful', 'news', 'Christy', 'bitterly', 'sarcastically', ""'m"", 'glad', 'taught', 'how', 'speak', 'could', 'say', 'Eileen', 'heartbreak', 'Christy', 'multiple', 'times', 'commit', 'suicide', 'continuing', 'love', 'support', 'family', 'water', 'barely', 'parents', 'build', 'room', 'own', 'where', 'can', 'paint', 'write', 'peace', 'Christy', 'father', 'soon', 'afterwards', 'Christy', 'autobiography', 'order', 'earn', 'money', 'family.The', 'movie', 'narrative', 'structure', 'unique', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'Christy', 'getting', 'ready', 'go', 'benefit', 'film', 'cut', 'back', 'present', 'go', 'where', 'nurse', 'autobiography', 'back', 'Christy', 'past.Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'Christy', 'Hugh', ""O'Connor"", 'young', 'Christy', 'are', 'seamless', 'transition', 'obvious', 'spent', 'time', 'CP', 'clinics', 'observing', 'behavior', 'movements', 'mannerisms', 'CP', 'patients', 'portray', 'Christy', 'sensitivity', 'eye', 'how', 'difficult', 'simplest', 'things', 'were', 'him.This', 'incredible', 'movie', 'seeing', 'Rory', ""O'Shea"", 'Was', 'Here', 'film', 'CP', 'adults', 'caregivers', 'including', 'Brenda', 'Fricker', 'wanted', 'see', 'Left', 'Foot', 'reading', 'so', 'many', 'comparisons', 'Special', 'Edition', 'DVD', 'several', 'trailers', 'other', 'Miramax', 'films', 'making-of', 'featuring', 'vintage', 'footage', 'Christy', 'family', 'interviews', 'mother', 'only', 'disappointment', 'was', 'terrible', 'transfer', 'quality', 'DVD', 'film', 'was', 'grainy', 'multiple', 'specks', 'dust', 'dirt', 'frame', 'looked', 'more', 'worn-out', 'VHS', 'tape', 'Shame', 'Miramax', 'calling', 'remastered.The', 'film', 'rated', 'R', 'profanity', 'domestic', 'violence', 'suicide', 'attempts', 'massive', 'alcohol', 'use']",My Left Foot

43353,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,0783114729,Stephanie De Pue,"[6, 7]","""My Left Foot,"" (1989), is a biographical drama on the life of Christy Brown, an Irish cerebral palsy sufferer who achieved international renown for his writing and painting, all done by his left foot, the only part of his anatomy that he could control.  It was based on his book, and directed by the Irish Jim Sheridan.  And, although it strongly resembles the television disease-of-the-week movies the networks used to make at that time, it soars far beyond them.  Among other accomplishments, it won two Academy Awards, took a further sixteen awards elsewhere, and had fourteen further nominations.To begin with,most of the disease-of-the-week movies were set in generic Anytown, U.S.A. ""My Left Foot"" is set very specifically in mid-20th century Dublin, among its working poor.  The film renders its location with detailed accuracy-- the look, the sound, the clothes, the feel, the mores, the cars, the housing, the ""crac,"" or wit of its people.The film also benefits from some remarkable acting.  Daniel Day Lewis won an Oscar for his portrayal of the adult Christy, witty, arrogant, vulgar, and strongly into drink and women when he could get them.  It was probably the best role in Day Lewis's career, and he really inhabited it to a stunning degree.  Brenda Fricker also won an Oscar for playing his lioness-defending-her-cub mother.  Two other performances were outstanding, though they failed to impress Oscar voters:  Hugh O'Conor was memorable as the young Christy.  And Ray McAnally powerfully defined the typical hard-nosed Irish working class father of the time. (Unfortunately, he died soon after completion of filming.) The picture introduced the pretty and pleasant Ruth McCabe, featured fine actors Fiona Shaw and Cyril Cusack, and gave us the frequently-seen Adrian Dunbar in a small part.The picture does wear its heart on its sleeve.  It strongly implies that Christy achieved what he did because his family loved and supported him, and included him in everything they did.  And that's not to say that maybe the film isn't right.",4,High-Powered  Disease of the Week TV Movie,1192406400,"10 15, 2007",2007,2051,"['Left', 'Foot', '1989', 'biographical', 'drama', 'life', 'Christy', 'Brown', 'Irish', 'cerebral', 'palsy', 'sufferer', 'who', 'achieved', 'international', 'renown', 'writing', 'painting', 'done', 'left', 'foot', 'only', 'part', 'anatomy', 'could', 'control', 'was', 'based', 'book', 'directed', 'Irish', 'Jim', 'Sheridan', 'strongly', 'television', 'disease-of-the-week', 'movies', 'networks', 'used', 'make', 'time', 'far', 'other', 'accomplishments', 'won', 'two', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'took', 'further', 'sixteen', 'awards', 'elsewhere', 'had', 'fourteen', 'further', 'nominations.To', 'begin', 'most', 'disease-of-the-week', 'movies', 'were', 'set', 'generic', 'Anytown', 'U.S.A.', 'Left', 'Foot', 'set', 'very', 'specifically', 'mid-20th', 'century', 'Dublin', 'working', 'poor', 'film', 'location', 'detailed', 'accuracy', 'look', 'sound', 'clothes', 'feel', 'mores', 'cars', 'housing', 'crac', 'wit', 'people.The', 'film', 'also', 'benefits', 'remarkable', 'acting', 'Daniel', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'won', 'Oscar', 'portrayal', 'adult', 'Christy', 'witty', 'arrogant', 'vulgar', 'strongly', 'drink', 'women', 'when', 'could', 'get', 'was', 'probably', 'best', 'role', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'career', 'really', 'inhabited', 'stunning', 'degree', 'Brenda', 'Fricker', 'also', 'won', 'Oscar', 'playing', 'lioness-defending-her-cub', 'mother', 'Two', 'other', 'performances', 'were', 'outstanding', 'failed', 'impress', 'Oscar', 'voters', 'Hugh', ""O'Conor"", 'was', 'memorable', 'young', 'Christy', 'Ray', 'McAnally', 'powerfully', 'defined', 'typical', 'hard-nosed', 'Irish', 'working', 'class', 'father', 'time', 'Unfortunately', 'died', 'soon', 'completion', 'filming', 'picture', 'introduced', 'pretty', 'pleasant', 'Ruth', 'McCabe', 'featured', 'fine', 'actors', 'Fiona', 'Shaw', 'Cyril', 'Cusack', 'gave', 'frequently-seen', 'Adrian', 'Dunbar', 'small', 'part.The', 'picture', 'wear', 'heart', 'sleeve', 'strongly', 'Christy', 'achieved', 'what', 'did', 'family', 'loved', 'supported', 'included', 'everything', 'did', 'not', 'say', 'maybe', 'film', ""n't"", 'right']",My Left Foot

It didnt come as a complete surprise however to witness Daniel Day-Lewis act is arse off like nobody could. There are not enough words to describe his performance. An oscar well deserved.

I'm glad I finally found the time, because it was worth it. Daniel Day-Lewis had been one of my favorite actors, but I've never seen the performance that won him an Oscar. And I can see why he got it now. I can also see why Brenda Fricker won Best Supporting Actress, although I still see her as the pigeon lady from Home Alone 2.The film was also nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay. It's clear to see why it got all these nominations. My Left Foot is an Irish film that tells a very Irish story, but at its heart it is a story of hope and encouragement for all of humanity.Wathcing Christy Brown's struggles with cerebral palsy that make him unable to move any part of his body except for his left foot is moving and endearing at the same time. Despite his physical handicap, Christy goes on to become a writer, publishing 6 novels and a book of poetry, as well as a great artist.The special features on this special edition are very interesting because they show footage of the real Christy Brown, as well as discuss Daniel Day-Lewis's transformation and dedication to the role. The producer also talks about their surprise at how much critical acclaim the film got considering they used Irish actors, film crew, director, and everything. It deserves all the acclaim it got, and almost 20 years later it's still just as enjoyable.",4,Very moving story about overcoming all odds,1176422400,"04 13, 2007",2007,1481,"['Left', 'Foot', 'one', 'films', 'hear', 'always', 'plan', 'see', 'point', 'never', 'get', ""'m"", 'glad', 'finally', 'found', 'time', 'was', 'worth', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'had', 'been', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'performance', 'won', 'Oscar', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'got', 'now', 'can', 'also', 'see', 'why', 'Brenda', 'Fricker', 'won', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'still', 'see', 'pigeon', 'lady', 'Home', 'Alone', '2.The', 'film', 'was', 'also', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Best', 'Director', 'Best', 'Adapted', 'Screenplay', 'clear', 'see', 'why', 'got', 'nominations', 'Left', 'Foot', 'Irish', 'film', 'very', 'Irish', 'story', 'heart', 'story', 'hope', 'encouragement', 'humanity.Wathcing', 'Christy', 'Brown', 'struggles', 'cerebral', 'palsy', 'make', 'unable', 'move', 'part', 'body', 'left', 'foot', 'moving', 'endearing', 'same', 'time', 'physical', 'handicap', 'Christy', 'become', 'writer', 'publishing', '6', 'novels', 'book', 'poetry', 'as', 'well', 'great', 'artist.The', 'special', 'features', 'special', 'edition', 'are', 'very', 'interesting', 'show', 'footage', 'real', 'Christy', 'Brown', 'as', 'well', 'discuss', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'transformation', 'dedication', 'role', 'producer', 'also', 'surprise', 'how', 'much', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'film', 'got', 'considering', 'used', 'Irish', 'actors', 'film', 'crew', 'director', 'everything', 'acclaim', 'got', 'almost', '20', 'years', 'later', 'still', 'just', 'enjoyable']",My Left Foot
