But anyways, the year is 1933 and during the great Depression.  a Young girl named Sonora Webster wants to go to Atlantic City to become a Horse Diver.  Sooo, she runs away from home  So, she runs away from home and becomes a stable cleaner at a carnival.  She ends up following a early &quot;Bufflo Bill&quot;-type owner of the fair, named Dr. Carver.  Then entering the story line is the owners son, Al, whom has a crush on Sonora, even when he's 13 years older than she is.  He trains her to become a horse diver, in which she does.  But as she trains, Al and his father fight about how their differences are keeping them apart.  As they set their sites on Atlantic City, things go from bad to worse. First, Dr. Carver suffers from a fatal heart attack, leaving his son to take over with sadness the whole way, mentioning that he never said &quot;I love you, dad&quot; or anything.  Next, Sororna is perminately Blind after a tragic accident with the horse.  But as tragity tends to hover over them, they try to overcome it.

305170,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6302274001,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","My eldest sister is a horse fanatic.  We owned horses (or I should say that SHE owned horses, which is what she always made sure I was aware of despite the fact that we lived in the same house and I saw her horses daily) and she was always riding them.  Until she got married (and even afterwards) she decorated everything in horses and I was forced to endure horse movies ALL THE TIME.  `Wild Hearts Can't Be Broken' was her favorite, and I think most of that was due to the fantasy daydream of a young horse lover who wanted nothing more than to have that free spirit expressed by the film's protagonist; Sonora Webster.Based on a true story, this Disney film centers on the young Sonora growing up in the 1930's.  The Great Depression has its own weight, but that is least of Sonora's problems.  Orphaned and alone she runs away to join the circus and soon lands herself a nice little act, riding a horse off a diving board into a pool of water.Young Gabrielle Anwar is aces in the part; a beautiful star turn by a young talent who never got the real break she deserved (why is she still basically unknown if not for that stunning Tango scene in that god-awful `Scent of a Woman'?).  Here she shines so brightly, and next to Reese Witherspoon's equally blessed moment in `Man in the Moon', 1991 was a great year for welcoming young talent.  Sure, this is sappy and nearly everything that Disney is, which is not always realistic in the most practical of terms, but it is beautifully shot and wonderfully acted.  It holds your interest, even if you aren't a horse love.  Yes, despite loathing the idea of watching this movie growing up, I have found that in my adulthood this is a film I can respect and adore for reasons of my own.",4,Makes a definite splash...,1336003200,"05 3, 2012",2012,1734,"['eldest', 'sister', 'horse', 'fanatic', 'owned', 'horses', 'should', 'say', 'SHE', 'owned', 'horses', 'what', 'always', 'made', 'sure', 'was', 'aware', 'fact', 'lived', 'same', 'house', 'saw', 'horses', 'daily', 'was', 'always', 'riding', 'got', 'married', 'even', 'afterwards', 'decorated', 'everything', 'horses', 'was', 'forced', 'endure', 'horse', 'movies', 'TIME', 'Wild', 'Hearts', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Be', 'Broken', 'was', 'favorite', 'think', 'most', 'was', 'due', 'fantasy', 'daydream', 'young', 'horse', 'lover', 'who', 'wanted', 'nothing', 'more', 'have', 'free', 'spirit', 'expressed', 'film', 'protagonist', 'Sonora', 'Webster.Based', 'true', 'story', 'Disney', 'film', 'centers', 'young', 'Sonora', 'growing', 'up', '1930', 'Great', 'Depression', 'own', 'weight', 'least', 'Sonora', 'problems', 'Orphaned', 'alone', 'away', 'join', 'circus', 'soon', 'nice', 'little', 'act', 'riding', 'horse', 'off', 'diving', 'board', 'pool', 'water.Young', 'Gabrielle', 'Anwar', 'aces', 'part', 'beautiful', 'star', 'turn', 'young', 'talent', 'who', 'never', 'got', 'real', 'break', 'deserved', 'why', 'still', 'basically', 'unknown', 'not', 'stunning', 'Tango', 'scene', 'god-awful', 'Scent', 'Woman', 'Here', 'so', 'brightly', 'next', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'equally', 'blessed', 'moment', 'Man', 'Moon', '1991', 'was', 'great', 'year', 'welcoming', 'young', 'talent', 'Sure', 'sappy', 'nearly', 'everything', 'Disney', 'not', 'always', 'realistic', 'most', 'practical', 'terms', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'wonderfully', 'acted', 'interest', 'even', 'are', ""n't"", 'horse', 'love', 'Yes', 'loathing', 'idea', 'watching', 'movie', 'growing', 'up', 'have', 'found', 'adulthood', 'film', 'can', 'respect', 'adore', 'reasons', 'own']",Wild Hearts Can't Be Broken VHS

Schoditsch,"[58, 84]","Why is this wonderful movie being released in 1.85:1 Anamorphic widescreen, Dolby Surround 2.0 PAL Format in Region 2 but here in the good old USA Region 1 we get the usual Disney garbage format of 1.33:1 full screen format?  Are the sadists at Disney really getting their jollies in tormenting Region 1 consumers?Nope I still don't get it.  And it doesn't help to get mad or even bother to write Disney.  The same swill keeps coming.  When will the madness end????????  :(Update:  Hey, come on folks.  Disney's OFFICIAL 2002 corporate policy whereby any movies that appearing to have limited adult appeal would be released on DVD in Pan & Scan only really cheats you out of seeing the movie the from the director's artistic vision.  Pan & Scan is truly a re-editing of the original movie at the whim of a film cutter, formatting a movie to fit a contemporary television screen format that is dying off by the minute.  Already many TV shows and MOST commmercials are already in the 16 X 9 format size.  Why in the world does anyone want a new DVD formatted like a VHS tape, which BTW is 30 year-old technology?  All directors will tell you that the ""black bars"" don't take away picture information, but that in watching a film in the original aspect ratio you are seeing the ""WHOLE"" movie, just the way it way meant to be viewed.",1,"""Blackbearded Again!""

Note that despite not being THX mastered, the picture quality is excellent.First off, I found my UK packaging to be pretty unclear. It mentions that this film is about a diver and pictures indicate that this is a movie about swimming. It isn't.This film is about a horse diver in a circus act- a person leaps onto a horse and they both dive together off of a diving board into a pool. It was released in 1991 by Walt Disney Pictures and stars the beautiful Gabrielle Anwar and Michael Schoeffling (from ""Mermaids""), and is directed by Steve Miner who would go on help produce and direct ""Dawson's Creek"". Based on a true story, it tells of a very determined orphan girl named Sonora who strives to be a horse diver. Along the way, she is on the brink of stardom, until an accident challenges everything she has been working for.I generally liked this movie. There's no particular human antagonist- the antagonists here are the depression, and life and death itself. Still, it holds your attention.For my generation, I found the best of Disney's live action movies to be in the 1990s- eg. the Mighty Ducks trilogy, Hocus Pocus, The Three Musketeers, The Jungle Book, Iron Will- the list goes on.

I loved horses as a young girl (and still do) but they are only part of the story. The determination of the orphan Sonora Webster, to achieve her dream, is inspiring and extremely entertaining. This is one of those rare films that effectively captures the era that it is set in, and where everything else seems to merge in harmony. The actors, costumes, scenery, music were all excellent, and the sweet love story between Sonora and Al Carver is subtly and gently captured on film, without relying on melodrama. Kathleen York as the snobby, high-society diving girl Marie, provides tremendous comic relief, along with Gabrielle Anwar and Cliff Robertson as the crusty Dr. Carver. I want to see this movie released on DVD and get all the recognition it deserves. I still enjoy watching it and it only grows more watchable with each viewing. It is a great family film and should be shared with everyone. Michael Schoeffling is so handsome as Al, and it's too bad (for us) that he no longer acts. His other great role was as high school hunk Jake Ryan in the teen cult hit ""Sixteen Candles"". Anwar covers up her British accent so convincingly you actually forget that she is British!!!!

Wild Hearts Can't Be Broken is one of those stories.Based on real life, it follows the tale of an orphan girl named Sonora Webster. After Sonora's parents die of &quot;the fever&quot; and her aunt leaves her at the mercy of the local orphanage, Sonora runs away with plans to become one of Dr. Carver's diving girls, a journey that takes her on an exciting adventure.Sonora is given the opportunity to prove she can be a diving girl; when she falls from her horse and gets a bloody nose, (while attempting to pull herself on) she answers in response to a gruff, &quot;you gonna cry, you gonna cry?&quot;  &quot;I never cry.&quot; she says, with a determined look in her eye.You'll laugh and you'll cry, right along with Sonora:  I can watch this film over and over again, it continually inspires me to follow my dreams and never give up!  From the first time that I saw this movie as a girl of 13, and even until today, I still tear up as Sonora defies impossible odds to fulfill her dreams. &quot;If you want something bad enough, anything is possible.&quot;",5,"An engrossing family tale, based on a true story!",1078876800,"03 10, 2004",2004,1175,"['once', 'awhile', 'story', 'so', 'heartfelt', 'so', 'touching', 'chord', 'deep', 'Wild', 'Hearts', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Be', 'Broken', 'one', 'stories.Based', 'real', 'life', 'tale', 'orphan', 'girl', 'named', 'Sonora', 'Webster', 'Sonora', 'parents', 'die', 'quot', 'fever', 'quot', 'aunt', 'mercy', 'local', 'orphanage', 'Sonora', 'away', 'plans', 'become', 'one', 'Dr', 'Carver', 'diving', 'girls', 'journey', 'exciting', 'adventure.Sonora', 'given', 'opportunity', 'prove', 'can', 'be', 'diving', 'girl', 'when', 'horse', 'bloody', 'nose', 'attempting', 'pull', 'response', 'gruff', 'quot', 'gon', 'cry', 'gon', 'cry', 'quot', 'quot', 'never', 'cry.', 'quot', 'determined', 'look', 'eye.You', ""'ll"", 'laugh', ""'ll"", 'cry', 'right', 'Sonora', 'can', 'watch', 'film', 'over', 'again', 'continually', 'follow', 'dreams', 'never', 'give', 'up', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'movie', 'girl', '13', 'even', 'today', 'still', 'tear', 'up', 'Sonora', 'impossible', 'odds', 'fulfill', 'dreams', 'quot', 'want', 'something', 'bad', 'enough', 'anything', 'possible.', 'quot']",Wild Hearts Can't Be Broken VHS
305214,A1J2931UBBJPXM,6302274001,Reviewer,"[63, 71]","Based on a true story, this film is not only entertaining, but as inspirational as they come; a paean to the indomitability of the human spirit in the face of the kind of adversity that would make most of us simply roll over and quit.  It's the story of the kind of challenges life can throw at anyone at random, and then follow up with yet another curve that seemingly takes it beyond the limits of human endurance.  It's a film that should be required viewing for anyone who has ever cried out that the world owes them a living, because the message of ""Wild Hearts Can't Be Broken,"" directed by Steve Miner, is that ""Life"" isn't fair, but when the worst happens you have to pick yourself up by the bootstraps and get on with it; nobody's going to do it for you.  It has something to do with a little thing called ""pride,"" and everything to do with the courage and tenacity it takes for someone to at least try to stand up when even the very hand of Fate seems bent on keeping them down.  There's a very definite lesson to be learned from this story; a lesson of which many living in the world today would be well advised to take note.In 1932, the Great Depression is on, but times are even more trying for teenager Sonora Webster (Gabrielle Anwar), who after losing her parents is taken in by her aunt, only to be told that because of financial difficulties besetting her own family, Sonora must be given over to the state.  Undaunted, the head-strong Sonora, even at such a tender age takes it upon herself to set the course of her own life.  She packs a bag and runs off to answer an ad placed in the newspaper by a certain Doctor Carver (Cliff Robertson), a showman looking for able young ladies to train as ""diving girls"" for his show.As part of a traveling circus, Doctor Carver currently has only one diving girl, Marie (Kathleen York); the act entails diving a horse off a forty foot tower into a pool of water.  Carver is skeptical that the young Sonora can do it, but she is adamant and refuses to leave until he gives her a chance.  And so he does; Carver hires her, but as a stable hand.  What he doesn't know is that he's just hired a girl who refuses to give up on something once she's set her mind to it, and when Sonora takes the job, it puts a hay fork in her hand, but her determined eye is on a horse, as well as that forty foot tower looming above that pool of water, beckoning to her, even as a dream borne on the wings of desire.  And in her heart, Sonora knows that it won't be long before she's up there, herself.  Up on the top of the world.Working from a screenplay by Matt Williams and Oley Sassone, Miner delivers a poignant film that works at the heart strings, but at the same time circumvents any undo sentimentality.  In light of the tragedy that befalls Sonora, this film could easily have played on sympathy and portrayed her as a victim of happenstance.  But to be known as a victim would have been the last thing in the world the real Sonora Webster would have wanted; indeed, she took the lemons life handed her and made the proverbial lemonade, refusing to be a ""victim"" in any sense of the word.  And that is the Sonora that Miner presents here, as he emphasizes the positive aspects of her life and what she accomplished, rather than dwelling upon the negative.  It's a story of pluck and determination, the message of which is delivered in a straightforward manner by Miner, without resorting to any superfluous action or melodrama to sell it.  This is a story that the filmmakers were wise enough to recognize would stand on it's own, without any attempt at dramatic enhancement.  They have taken some license as far as certain dates and specific lengths of time involved, and certain elements are compacted in order to move the story along; but the important thing is, the essential elements of Sonora's life and her incredible achievements are portrayed accurately.Young Gabrielle Anwar gives a performance in which she perfectly captures Sonora's spirit and the stubbornness that refused to allow her to give in to any and all of the obstacles life put in her path.  Through Anwar's portrayal, we see a girl who overcomes the most heartbreaking situations by always looking forward; a true individual who always sees the glass as half full rather than half empty, and it's Anwar who makes that vital connection with the audience happen.  It's a solid performance, worthy of the character she so ably brings to the screen.Cliff Robertson gives a memorable performance, as well, as Doctor Carver.  He affects an outwardly ostentatious look and attitude that marks him as a true showman-- he looks like Buffalo Bill in full regalia-- but he indicates an individual of some complexity residing beneath it all.  And there is a reserve to his performance that contradicts his appearance and effectively points up that intricacy of his nature.  Most importantly, Robertson is convincing, and it makes the flamboyant Doctor Carver very real.The one weakness of the film is in the performance of Michael Schoeffling as Al, Doctor Carver's son.  He has the chiseled features of a GQ model, and though his portrayal is passable, it lacks the depth that would've made it a bit more believable.  He comes across as something of a ""wooden"" Matt Dillon, and while his performance does not necessarily detract from the film, neither does it add anything.  It's a minor consideration, though, that ""Wild Hearts Can't Be Broken"" manages to transcend quite effectively.  In the end, this film is a thoroughly satisfying and emotional experience.",5,A Profile of Courage and Tenacity,1030838400,"09 1, 2002",2002,5572,"['Based', 'true', 'story', 'film', 'not', 'only',
