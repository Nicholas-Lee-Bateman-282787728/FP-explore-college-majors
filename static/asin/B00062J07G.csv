857543,AIPSUF99BQ17T,B00062J07G,Amazon.com-lover,"[6, 8]","I was a child when this play came out, but always heard of Oh! Calcutta! Very surprised when I stumbled upon this DVD ( which according to another reviewer here who said he was in the show: the actors were not paid? Sorry Amazon, if that is true I can not buy this DVD)Even by today's standards, and I am not a prude or anything,  there were elements of this play that were raunchy and surprising but overall I really enjoyed it. ( rape scene-awful!!! scientists studying 2 people having sex-funny!) I can see where Saturday Night Live may have been influenced by this play. Several of the skits were really clever, such as the 5 singers sitting on stools, wearing formal wear singing about fantasies. I had to play that scene again, the music/singing was fantastic!Now another reason I liked it and maybe others would not, is because I have a thing for early 70s music, style, history,aura...and if you want to go back in time and get a big sense of the era, this DVD will take you there, from the opening shot of the audience ( styles of clothes, their makeup , etc) to the semi psychedelic hippyish music and the scene of naked frolicing outdoors...it was a time warp!Definatly worth renting but again, if what that other reviewer says is true, i can not endorse buying it. It was wrong not to pay the actors fairly.",3,It was fun to see evidence of the early 1970s,1173744000,"03 13, 2007",2007,1319,"['was', 'child', 'when', 'play', 'came', 'out', 'always', 'heard', 'Oh', 'Calcutta', 'Very', 'surprised', 'when', 'stumbled', 'DVD', 'according', 'reviewer', 'here', 'who', 'said', 'was', 'show', 'actors', 'were', 'not', 'paid', 'Sorry', 'Amazon', 'true', 'can', 'not', 'buy', 'DVD', 'Even', 'today', 'standards', 'am', 'not', 'prude', 'anything', 'were', 'elements', 'play', 'were', 'raunchy', 'surprising', 'overall', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'rape', 'scene-awful', 'scientists', 'studying', '2', 'people', 'having', 'sex-funny', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'influenced', 'play', 'Several', 'skits', 'were', 'really', 'clever', 'such', '5', 'singers', 'sitting', 'stools', 'wearing', 'formal', 'wear', 'singing', 'fantasies', 'had', 'play', 'scene', 'again', 'music/singing', 'was', 'fantastic', 'Now', 'reason', 'liked', 'maybe', 'others', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'thing', 'early', '70s', 'music', 'style', 'history', 'aura', 'want', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'get', 'big', 'sense', 'era', 'DVD', 'will', 'take', 'there', 'opening', 'shot', 'audience', 'styles', 'clothes', 'makeup', 'etc', 'semi', 'psychedelic', 'hippyish', 'music', 'scene', 'naked', 'frolicing', 'outdoors', 'was', 'time', 'warp', 'Definatly', 'renting', 'again', 'what', 'other', 'reviewer', 'true', 'i', 'can', 'not', 'endorse', 'buying', 'was', 'wrong', 'not', 'pay', 'actors', 'fairly']",N/A

What caught my eye in the Amazon description is that it lists (twice) John Lennon as an actor in it. I don't think so! He supposedly contributed a rough draft of one of the sketches...as did many other contributors. As I recall, in the Playbill at the time no one person was credited with any particular sketch, so it was always a matter of guessing...and futile guessing at that.At the time, any nudity onstage was shocking and thus of course commercially viable. HAIR had its one scene where everyone (as I recall it) was under a blanket or something, stripping. Then they stood up and threw off the cover and a split second later the lights blacked out. The nude cast ran up the aisles and then the houselights came up for intermission. Joe Butler of The Lovin' Spoonful was in the cast when I saw the show and he ran up the aisle to my right. This recollection has nothing to do with OH! CALCUTTA, but I thought I'd throw it in anyway.Getting back to OH! CALCUTTA, in this age of frequent nudity (though never enough!), I don't suppose the ""shock value"" of this piece is anything more than quaint. And the price of this is rather prohibitive.

857547,A3GJGBF7FO8WDJ,B00062J07G,"Tom Knapp ""Rambles.NET editor""","[8, 9]","There was a lot of new ground broken when ""Oh! Calcutta!"" opened off Broadway as the turbulent '60s rolled to a close. Half play, half musical, the production was notable for its brazen use of full nudity (male and female) on stage. Even today, three decades later (and more than 10 years since the long-running show closed its curtain for the last time in Manhattan), I still hear about the bold, innovative landmark in theater. Given the involvement of luminaries such as John Lennon, Sam Shepard, Jules Feiffer and Peter Schickele (a.k.a. PDQ Bach) in its composition, I was intrigued to see how the video of the original ""Oh! Calcutta!"" stood the test of time.It doesn't.I've seen a lot of creative things done combining nudity and dance, and much of it has been done quite well. And it's in that area that ""Oh! Calcutta!"" still shines. The choreography, credited to Margo Sappington, is excellent in many places.But the comic skits which make up the bulk of the show are for the most part sophomoric. The writers and performers seem almost like pre-teens, giggling at the blatant sexuality and striving primarily to shock the audience. This isn't just stage nudity, you see -- the video is laced heavily with simulated sex, oral sex and gratuitous groping.I could probably have been a lot more forgiving if the production had gotten off to a better start. However, after a successful opening scene, the second bit left a bitter taste in my mouth for the rest of the show.The scene in question features nursery rhyme characters Jack and Jill in bright yellow schoolchild garb; it starts off as a mildly amusing farce about innocence in the face of ""cocktail parties and orgy parties"" and ends with a brutal rape. There's nothing to laugh about, nor is there any deep or meaningful point to be made. The scene attempts to shock, which it does successfully. But, given that most of the play is ""funny stuff,"" rape is a tasteless, pointless plot device.Nothing in the remaining span of the video redeems that fatal flaw. Sure, some of the skits are funny, and some are clever, but there isn't anything funny or clever enough. And some scenes -- for instance, a nervous husband and wife on their first night of spouse swapping, and a group of men who project sexual fantasies on a big screen and masturbate to the images -- are just plain crude.Fortunately, ""Oh! Calcutta!"" still has some excellent dance numbers going for it. Unfortunately, the music itself is fairly lackluster throughout. All in all, there are better ways to spend two hours of your time, unless you're really desperate to see nude bodies on stage.by Tom Knapp, Rambles editor",2,Lackluster & unfunny,1165363200,"12 6, 2006",2006,2646,"['was', 'lot', 'new', 'ground', 'broken', 'when', 'Oh', 'Calcutta', 'opened', 'off', 'Broadway', 'turbulent', ""'60s"", 'rolled', 'close', 'Half', 'play', 'half', 'musical', 'production', 'was', 'notable', 'brazen', 'use', 'full', 'nudity', 'male', 'female', 'stage', 'Even', 'today', 'three', 'decades', 'later', 'more', '10', 'years', 'long-running', 'show', 'closed', 'curtain', 'last', 'time', 'Manhattan', 'still', 'hear', 'bold', 'innovative', 'landmark', 'theater', 'Given', 'involvement', 'luminaries', 'such', 'John', 'Lennon', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'Jules', 'Feiffer', 'Peter', 'Schickele', 'a.k.a', 'PDQ', 'Bach', 'composition', 'was', 'intrigued', 'see', 'how', 'video', 'original', 'Oh', 'Calcutta', 'stood', 'test', 'time.It', ""doesn't.I"", ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lot', 'creative', 'things', 'done', 'combining', 'nudity', 'dance', 'much', 'been', 'done', 'quite', 'well', 'area', 'Oh', 'Calcutta', 'still', 'choreography', 'credited', 'Margo', 'Sappington', 'excellent', 'many', 'places.But', 'comic', 'skits', 'make', 'up', 'bulk', 'show', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'sophomoric', 'writers', 'performers', 'seem', 'almost', 'pre-teens', 'giggling', 'blatant', 'sexuality', 'striving', 'primarily', 'shock', 'audience', ""n't"", 'just', 'stage', 'nudity', 'see', 'video', 'laced', 'heavily', 'simulated', 'sex', 'oral', 'sex', 'gratuitous', 'groping.I', 'could', 'probably', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'more', 'forgiving', 'production', 'had', 'gotten', 'off', 'better', 'start', 'However', 'successful', 'opening', 'scene', 'second', 'bit', 'left', 'bitter', 'taste', 'mouth', 'rest', 'show.The', 'scene', 'question', 'features', 'rhyme', 'characters', 'Jack', 'Jill', 'bright', 'yellow', 'schoolchild', 'garb', 'off', 'mildly', 'amusing', 'farce', 'innocence', 'face', 'cocktail', 'parties', 'orgy', 'parties', 'brutal', 'rape', 'nothing', 'laugh', 'about', 'there', 'deep', 'meaningful', 'point', 'be', 'made', 'scene', 'attempts', 'shock', 'successfully', 'given', 'most', 'play', 'funny', 'stuff', 'rape', 'tasteless', 'pointless', 'plot', 'device.Nothing', 'remaining', 'span', 'video', 'fatal', 'flaw', 'Sure', 'skits', 'are', 'funny', 'are', 'clever', ""n't"", 'anything', 'funny', 'clever', 'enough', 'scenes', 'instance', 'nervous', 'husband', 'wife', 'first', 'night', 'spouse', 'swapping', 'group', 'men', 'who', 'project', 'sexual', 'fantasies', 'big', 'screen', 'masturbate', 'images', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'crude.Fortunately', 'Oh', 'Calcutta', 'still', 'excellent', 'dance', 'numbers', 'going', 'Unfortunately', 'music', 'fairly', 'lackluster', 'are', 'better', 'ways', 'spend', 'two', 'hours', 'time', ""'re"", 'really', 'desperate', 'see', 'nude', 'bodies', 'stage.by', 'Tom', 'Knapp', 'Rambles', 'editor']",N/A
