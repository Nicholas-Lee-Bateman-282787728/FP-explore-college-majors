If you've watched any of the MOH series at all then you already know what to expect as far as quality goes. The special effects are good but the acting leaves a bit to be desired. Dream Cruise is a bit misleading too, I expected a cruise ship but instead I got a cabin cruiser so I was a bit concerned how they were going to make such a confined area to be scary but they do it really well. The scene with the arm is one that I will remember for some time, it was really good. I can not say a whole lot without giving much of the plot away but the abridged version is a young and upcoming lawyer falls in love with one of his clients wives. His client invites him out for a cruise to discuss a new business deal but the lawyer is strill struggling with the demons of his past and his brothers drowning so a cruise is the last thing that he wants. However, ever a lawyer he agrees to go with the client and his wife (the one he is having an affiar with) on the boat only to find out that his client knows all about the affair and is driving them out to the middle of no where. After some much horrible dialog, acting and miles from any civilation, the boat becomes (not surprisingly) helplessy stranded and that's when the fun begins.I'll leave the rest for you to watch and see for yourself.

1097613,A37OOQQLMMKYR8,B000UYX4P4,Dave. K,"[8, 9]","Despite the listing here on Amazon and the box cover, Dream Cruise is actually the 87-minute version. When it aired on ShowTime it was cut to 60-minutes, but the DVD is actually the original 87-minute cut despite the listing here and the back of the box stating 60-minutes.Going into Dream Cruise I wasn't sure what to expect. Over the last couple of years the Asian ghost story has really run out of steam. Asia has a lot more to offer the horror genre, but these films are popular there and the rest of the world. It's sort of like the American slasher movie. They seemed to dominate the early to mid 80s. While there were plenty of non slasher movies it really did seem like, that's all that was out there. Filmmakers found something that worked and milked it for everything it was worth and now that has happened to the Asian ghost story.The last few Asian ghost movies I have seen after it was over I just felt like so what? It's the same story over and over again and it really has gotten to the point to where you can't even tell these films a part, but unlike the American slasher movie, I do feel as if the Asian ghost story can still work.Let's face it Dream Cruise doesn't really offer anything we haven't seen before. If you're well schooled on these movies you should know how this one will play out. But it's about how you take these clich&eacute;s and work it. And the makers of Dream Cruise are able to take a clich&eacute;d story and sort of make it work.Jack played by Daniel Gillies is an American businessman working in Japan; he's also having an affair with Yuri Saito played by Yoshino Kimura who's married to Eiji Saito played by the very cool Ryo Ishibashi who happens to be a client to Jack. Eiji takes Jack and Yuri on a cruise that turns out to be the ultimate horror.Like most Asian horror flicks, Dream Cruise does run at a slow, but steady pace. In many ways the movie starts off as a drama. Eiji knows his wife his cheating on him with Jack and they both know as well, but Eiji drops little hints that he knows and doesn't come right out and say it. Those scenes actually play out quite well and to be honest might be the strongest scenes of the movie.Dream Cruise is based off a story by Koji Suzuki who has been dubbed the Japanese Stephen King. Koji wrote the novel Ringu so this guy is one of the Icons of Japanese horror. The screenplay was written by Naoya Takayama & Norio Tsuruta. And overall the script is quite well done. While it doesn't offer anything we haven't seen before it does work well as do the characters.Norio Tsuruta also served as director and is able to keep Dream Cruise running at a slow, but steady pace. While Tsuruta doesn't really offer us anything we haven't seen done before he does make the best of everything and is able to create an overall solid movie. The first half has some decent tension with Eiji knowing about the affair, but after that the tension does lack at times.The fact I have seen so many of these movies I suppose it's kinda hard for me to really feel the suspense and tension and even though Tsuruta does a solid job, I can't help, but feel I have already seen this before and seen it done a bit better. The last act though does feature some solid tension even if it never reaches the greatness some other movies like this did it does play out rather well.The actors all do a solid job unlike Imprint from season 1; most of the Japanese actors in Imprint spoke no English or very little. So you have to understand it's not easy for the actors to deliver their lines in English and sound good. Dream Cruise though the Japanese actors do a solid job; Yoshino Kimura lived in America therefore her English was very good and Ryo Ishibashi who is best known to horror fans from Audition also does a solid job. I don't know how well he knows English, but regardless he provides an excellent and very creepy performance.When the Japanese actors talk to each other they mostly speak in Japanese, which was something I was pleased with. I hate movies that feature characters from a non-English speaking country, but yet they speak to one another in English. So I was pleased that the Japanese actors actually spoke to each other in mostly Japanese.Dream Cruise despite the clich&eacute;s actually plays out rather well while it does lack the suspense and tension for the most part it still works well and the final act does have some solid tension. Dream Cruise isn't the best Asian ghost flick I have ever seen, but it does work and was able to hold my interest despite the clich&eacute;s.",4,The dream cruise to hell,1194912000,"11 13, 2007",2007,4565,"['listing', 'here', 'Amazon', 'box', 'cover', 'Dream', 'Cruise', 'actually', '87-minute', 'version', 'When', 'aired', 'ShowTime', 'was', 'cut', '60-minutes', 'DVD', 'actually', 'original', '87-minute', 'cut', 'listing', 'here', 'back', 'box', 'stating', '60-minutes.Going', 'Dream', 'Cruise', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'last', 'couple', 'years', 'Asian', 'ghost', 'story', 'really', 'run', 'steam', 'Asia', 'lot', 'more', 'offer', 'horror', 'genre', 'films', 'are', 'popular', 'there', 'rest', 'world', 'sort', 'American', 'slasher', 'movie', 'seemed', 'dominate', 'early', 'mid', '80s', 'were', 'plenty', 'non', 'slasher', 'movies', 'really', 'did', 'seem', 'was', 'there', 'Filmmakers', 'found', 'something', 'worked', 'milked', 'everything', 'was', 'worth', 'now', 'happened', 'Asian', 'ghost', 'story.The', 'last', 'few', 'Asian', 'ghost', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'was', 'just', 'felt', 'what', 'same', 'story', 'over', 'again', 'really', 'gotten', 'point', 'where', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'tell', 'films', 'part', 'American', 'slasher', 'movie', 'do', 'feel', 'Asian', 'ghost', 'story', 'can', 'still', 'work.Let', 'face', 'Dream', 'Cruise', ""n't"", 'really', 'offer', 'anything', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before', ""'re"", 'well', 'schooled', 'movies', 'should', 'know', 'how', 'one', 'will', 'play', 'out', 'how', 'take', 'clich', 'eacute', 'work', 'makers', 'Dream', 'Cruise', 'are', 'able', 'take', 'clich', 'eacute', 'story', 'sort', 'make', 'work.Jack', 'played', 'Daniel', 'Gillies', 'American', 'businessman', 'working', 'Japan', 'also', 'having', 'affair', 'Yuri', 'Saito', 'played', 'Yoshino', 'Kimura', 'who', 'married', 'Eiji', 'Saito', 'played', 'very', 'cool', 'Ryo', 'Ishibashi', 'who', 'be', 'client', 'Jack', 'Eiji', 'Jack', 'Yuri', 'cruise', 'out', 'be', 'ultimate', 'horror.Like', 'most', 'Asian', 'horror', 'flicks', 'Dream', 'Cruise', 'run', 'slow', 'steady', 'pace', 'many', 'ways', 'movie', 'off', 'drama', 'Eiji', 'wife', 'cheating', 'Jack', 'know', 'as', 'well', 'Eiji', 'little', 'hints', ""n't"", 'come', 'right', 'say', 'scenes', 'actually', 'play', 'out', 'quite', 'well', 'be', 'honest', 'might', 'be', 'strongest', 'scenes', 'movie.Dream', 'Cruise', 'based', 'off', 'story', 'Koji', 'Suzuki', 'who', 'been', 'dubbed', 'Japanese', 'Stephen', 'King', 'Koji', 'wrote', 'novel', 'Ringu', 'guy', 'one', 'Icons', 'Japanese', 'horror', 'screenplay', 'was', 'written', 'Naoya', 'Takayama', 'Norio', 'Tsuruta', 'overall', 'script', 'quite', 'well', 'done', ""n't"", 'offer', 'anything', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'work', 'well', 'do', 'characters.Norio', 'Tsuruta', 'also', 'served', 'director', 'able', 'keep', 'Dream', 'Cruise', 'running', 'slow', 'steady', 'pace', 'Tsuruta', ""n't"", 'really', 'offer', 'anything', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'done', 'make', 'best', 'everything', 'able', 'create', 'overall', 'solid', 'movie', 'first', 'half', 'decent', 'tension', 'Eiji', 'knowing', 'affair', 'tension', 'lack', 'times.The', 'fact', 'have', 'seen', 'so', 'many', 'movies', 'suppose', 'kinda', 'hard', 'really', 'feel', 'suspense', 'tension', 'even', 'Tsuruta', 'solid', 'job', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'seen', 'done', 'bit', 'better', 'last', 'act', 'feature', 'solid', 'tension', 'even', 'never', 'greatness', 'other', 'movies', 'did', 'play', 'out', 'rather', 'well.The', 'actors', 'do', 'solid', 'job', 'Imprint', 'season', '1', 'most', 'Japanese', 'actors', 'Imprint', 'spoke', 'English', 'very', 'little', 'have', 'understand', 'not', 'easy', 'actors', 'deliver', 'lines', 'English', 'sound', 'good', 'Dream', 'Cruise', 'Japanese', 'actors', 'do', 'solid', 'job', 'Yoshino', 'Kimura', 'lived', 'America', 'English', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'Ryo', 'Ishibashi', 'who', 'best', 'known', 'horror', 'fans', 'Audition', 'also', 'solid', 'job', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'well', 'English', 'regardless', 'excellent', 'very', 'creepy', 'performance.When', 'Japanese', 'actors', 'talk', 'other', 'mostly', 'speak', 'Japanese', 'was', 'something', 'was', 'pleased', 'hate', 'movies', 'feature', 'characters', 'non-English', 'speaking', 'country', 'yet', 'speak', 'one', 'English', 'So', 'was', 'pleased', 'Japanese', 'actors', 'actually', 'spoke', 'other', 'mostly', 'Japanese.Dream', 'Cruise', 'clich', 'eacute', 'actually', 'out', 'rather', 'well', 'lack', 'suspense', 'tension', 'most', 'part', 'still', 'well', 'final', 'act', 'have', 'solid', 'tension', 'Dream', 'Cruise', ""n't"", 'best', 'Asian', 'ghost', 'flick', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'work', 'was', 'able', 'hold', 'interest', 'clich', 'eacute', 's']",N/A
1097614,A1N7YA81ZI4KAF,B000UYX4P4,"E. Valero ""Eterno""","[1, 1]","A young American lawyer living in Japan, Jack Miller, (Daniel Gillies) who is deathly afraid of the ocean and who is having an affair with a young woman, Yuri (Yoshino Kimura) is invited by his lovers husband, Eiji (Ryo Ishibashi) to go on a cruise to discuss business. Despite his phobia, Jack agrees and is unaware that the shrewd Eiji knows of the affair. As Eiji leads his yacht farther away from the coast it becomes apparent he has revenge on his mind. However, Eiji is no victim and his murderous past comes back to haunt him from beneath the cold, dark waters as the spirit of his first wife, Naomi, resurfaces to avenge her senseless murder.Norio Tsuruta directed this odd little chiller and those expecting a gruesome and explicit Japanese tale of terror like Takashi Miike's ""Imprint"" may be disappointed. This entry is a bit tame in comparison and unlike other episodes from the MOH series which run about 60 minutes, this film runs a heck of a lot longer. It is close to 90 minutes so if it feels long, it is. The longer running time allows the director to fully flesh out the story. Yes the plot takes its sweet time which means their is a lot of talk with very little action. Once the ghost is introduced however and she makes her horrific appearance, the film shifts to high gear and delivers the chills expected from a good, quality ghost story. Like your typical Japanese ghost movie, this grudge holding phantasm moves awkwardly and typically has slimy, straight hair streaming down her wicked face. She is a sight to behold. Those expecting a ""Ringu"" or a ""Grudge"" like ghostie will be pleased and the films creepiness factor compensates for the lack of gore and sex which fans of the series have come to expect. There are moments of absolute absurdity which is not uncommon but when I watch a serious ghost story, I sometimes start asking questions such as why is a ghost trying to break down a locked door? I dunno. And this episode does suffer from a disappointing climax.Overall, ""Dream Cruise"" is a solid entry but more chills and surprises were needed to make this one truly stand out of the bunch since it's pretty cliched. They could have utilized the vengeful spirit a bit more and I would have preferred a much darker ending considering all of the characters were immoral, selfish human beings. None of the characters with the exception of the spirit herself (before her messy demise) inspired any real sympathy. With that said, there are moments here that are truly hair-raising and those looking for a mild excursion into the supernatural may find this entry satisfying.",3,Slow Moving But Has Its Moments.,1261699200,"12 25, 2009",2009,2602,"['young', 'American', 'lawyer', 'living', 'Japan', 'Jack', 'Miller', 'Daniel', 'Gillies', 'who', 'deathly', 'afraid', 'ocean', 'who', 'having', 'affair', 'young', 'woman', 'Yuri', 'Yoshino', 'Kimura', 'invited', 'lovers', 'husband', 'Eiji', 'Ryo', 'Ishibashi', 'go', 'cruise', 'discuss', 'business', 'phobia', 'Jack', 'unaware', 'shrewd', 'Eiji', 'affair', 'Eiji', 'yacht', 'farther', 'away', 'coast', 'apparent', 'revenge', 'mind', 'However', 'Eiji', 'victim', 'murderous', 'past', 'back', 'haunt', 'cold', 'dark', 'waters', 'spirit', 'first', 'wife', 'Naomi', 'avenge', 'senseless', 'murder.Norio', 'Tsuruta', 'directed', 'odd', 'little', 'chiller', 'expecting', 'gruesome', 'explicit', 'Japanese', 'tale', 'terror', 'Takashi', 'Miike', 'Imprint', 'may', 'be', 'disappointed', 'entry', 'bit', 'tame', 'comparison', 'other', 'episodes', 'MOH', 'series', 'run', '60', 'minutes', 'film', 'heck', 'lot', 'longer', 'close', '90', 'minutes', 'so', 'long', 'longer', 'running', 'time', 'director', 'fully', 'flesh', 'out', 'story', 'Yes', 'plot', 'sweet', 'time', 'lot', 'talk', 'very', 'little', 'action', 'ghost', 'introduced', 'however', 'horrific', 'appearance', 'film', 'shifts', 'high', 'gear', 'chills', 'expected', 'good', 'quality', 'ghost', 'story', 'typical', 'Japanese', 'ghost', 'movie', 'grudge', 'holding', 'phantasm', 'moves', 'awkwardly', 'typically', 'slimy', 'straight', 'hair', 'streaming', 'down', 'wicked', 'face', 'sight', 'behold', 'expecting', 'Ringu', 'Grudge', 'ghostie', 'will', 'be', 'pleased', 'films', 'creepiness', 'factor', 'compensates', 'lack', 'gore', 'sex', 'fans', 'series', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'are', 'moments', 'absolute', 'absurdity', 'not', 'uncommon', 'when', 'watch', 'serious', 'ghost', 'story', 'sometimes', 'start', 'asking', 'questions', 'such', 'why', 'ghost', 'trying', 'break', 'down', 'locked', 'door', 'dunno', 'episode', 'suffer', 'disappointing', 'climax.Overall', 'Dream', 'Cruise', 'solid', 'entry', 'more', 'chills', 'surprises', 'were', 'needed', 'make', 'one', 'truly', 'stand', 'bunch', 'pretty', 'cliched', 'could', 'have', 'utilized', 'vengeful', 'spirit', 'bit', 'more', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'much', 'darker', 'ending', 'considering', 'characters', 'were', 'immoral', 'selfish', 'human', 'beings', 'None', 'characters', 'exception', 'spirit', 'messy', 'demise', 'inspired', 'real', 'sympathy', 'said', 'are', 'moments', 'here', 'are', 'truly', 'hair-raising', 'looking', 'mild', 'excursion', 'supernatural', 'may', 'find', 'entry', 'satisfying']",N/A

She is then tossed over board and never seen again... until about a year later when all the guilty party are on the boat and 'surprisingly' the same spot where she was killed.  Anyways... thats the plot jist... now lets get to the good stuff!Shes a vengeful spirit who is looking to exact revenge upon her ex - husband, and the woman that he killed her for and the man that is sleeping with her now.

Oh, ok... then I did now.Without giving too much away, the scares in this one are far more abundant than any other episode thus far.

I don't know it is just the fact that he is struggling with an American accent(he seem to be Australian in the documentary), but his general demeanor is that of a street thug, not a high powered attorney-very poor casting(if he's a foreigner, why not just let him speak with his own accent?). Secondly, the entire moral ambiguity of the finale leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Sure, the husband has dispatched the  first wife and deserves the typical J horror retribution, but why are the 2 adulterers spared? Especially the wife-who admits she only married her husband for the money and the status? Why would S. save the woman (and come to think of it-why would he save the brother who admitted to doing next to nothing while he drowned?)The effects are silly and the scene with the hand is laugh out loud funny.

1097618,AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B000UYX4P4,"N. Durham ""Big Evil""","[0, 1]","Directed by Ringu helmer Norio Tsuruta, Dream Cruise is a J-horror flavored episode of Masters of Horror, which pretty much sums up all that one needs to know upon entering here.  Daniel Gillies (Spider-Man 2, Captivity) stars as Jack, an American lawyer terrified by the sea who is invited on board the boat of a client (Ryo Ishibashi) whose wife (Yoshino Kimura) Jack is having an affair with.  Things run afoul for everyone involved however when vengeful spirits (what other sort are there in the world of J-horror after all?) begin to surface and wreck havoc, which leads to a very predictable ending.  The problem with Dream Cruise isn't that it isn't well-filmed or well put together, it's just that everything about it has been seen before and seen better in many other films of this type.  There are some genuinely creepy moments, but a majority of Dream Cruise is just plain boring.

Which is pretty amazing in itself, but then it started squeezing great work out of directors (Argento and Carpenter in particular) who seemed incapable of it for decades beforehand. And what a roster--Joe Dante, Takashi Miike, Don Coscarelli... Norio Tsuruta? Yep, Norio Tsuruta, who at the time he was tabbed for this was a V-cinema guy who'd theatrically released one mildly successful suspense film, &lt;em>Premonition&lt;/em>, and one weak series entry, &lt;em>Ring 0: Birthday&lt;/em>. So I was a bit skeptical when I turned this one on. To be fair, it was better than I expected, though if you're looking for anything groundbreaking, you're not going to find it here.Based on a short story by &lt;em>Ring&lt;/em> author Kji Suzuki, &lt;em>Dream Cruise&lt;/em>tells the tale of Jack Miller (&lt;em>Captivity&lt;/em>'s Daniel Gillies), a lawyer who is terrified of the water thanks to the drowning death of his brother Sean (&lt;em>Sushi King Goes to New York!&lt;/em>'s Ethan Amis) when they were children. Despite this, Jack agrees to go for an afternoon cruise with a client (&lt;em>Audition&lt;/em>'s Ryo Ishibashi)  and his wife (&lt;em>Blindness&lt;/em>' Yoshino Kimura) in order to get a signature. But, it turns out, everyone on the ship is hiding secrets... and Jack isn't the only one haunted by them.It's not a bad little flick, carried mostly by Gillies, Kimura, and Ishibashi's considerable acting skills, but you're probably going to be able to name every development at least five minutes before it happens. This would be okay were Tsuruta enough of a stylist to make the old ground feel freshly-trod, but it comes off as a remake of something from his V-cinema days, and not even as stylish a one as &lt;em>Premonition&lt;/em>. Worth checking out if you've exhausted all the rest of the Asian horror in the rental store. ***",3,Season 2 series finale not up to standard.,1335484800,"04 27, 2012",2012,2025,"['lt', 'strong', '>', 'Masters', 'Horror', 'Dream', 'Cruise', 'lt', '>', 'Norio', 'Tsuruta', '2007', 'masters', 'Horror', 'series', 'brought', 'together', 'greatest', 'names', 'horror', 'film', 'TV', 'series', 'Which', 'pretty', 'amazing', 'then', 'started', 'squeezing', 'great', 'work', 'directors', 'Argento', 'Carpenter', 'particular', 'who', 'seemed', 'incapable', 'decades', 'beforehand', 'what', 'roster', 'Joe', 'Dante', 'Takashi', 'Miike', 'Don', 'Coscarelli', 'Norio', 'Tsuruta', 'Yep', 'Norio', 'Tsuruta', 'who', 'time', 'was', 'tabbed', 'was', 'V-cinema', 'guy', 'who', 'theatrically', 'released', 'one', 'mildly', 'successful', 'suspense', 'film', 'lt', '>', 'Premonition', 'lt', '>', 'one', 'weak', 'series', 'entry', 'lt', '>', 'Ring', '0', 'Birthday', 'lt', '>', 'So', 'was', 'bit', 'skeptical', 'when', 'turned', 'one', 'be', 'fair', 'was', 'better', 'expected', ""'re"", 'looking', 'anything', 'groundbreaking', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'find', 'here.Based', 'short', 'story', 'lt', '>', 'Ring', 'lt', '>', 'author', 'Kji', 'Suzuki', 'lt', '>', 'Dream', 'Cruise', 'lt', '>', 'tale', 'Jack', 'Miller', 'lt', '>', 'Captivity', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Daniel', 'Gillies', 'lawyer', 'who', 'terrified', 'water', 'thanks', 'drowning', 'death', 'brother', 'Sean', 'lt', '>', 'Sushi', 'King', 'Goes', 'New', 'York', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Ethan', 'Amis', 'when', 'were', 'children', 'Jack', 'go', 'afternoon', 'cruise', 'client', 'lt', '>', 'Audition', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Ryo', 'Ishibashi', 'wife', 'lt', '>', 'Blindness', 'lt', '>', 'Yoshino', 'Kimura', 'order', 'get', 'signature', 'out', 'everyone', 'ship', 'hiding', 'secrets', 'Jack', ""n't"", 'only', 'one', 'haunted', 'them.It', 'not', 'bad', 'little', 'flick', 'carried', 'mostly', 'Gillies', 'Kimura', 'Ishibashi', 'considerable', 'acting', 'skills', ""'re"", 'probably', 'going', 'be', 'able', 'name', 'development', 'least', 'five', 'minutes', 'would', 'be', 'okay', 'were', 'Tsuruta', 'enough', 'stylist', 'make', 'old', 'ground', 'feel', 'freshly-trod', 'off', 'remake', 'something', 'V-cinema', 'days', 'not', 'even', 'stylish', 'one', 'lt', '>', 'Premonition', 'lt', '>', 'Worth', 'checking', 'out', ""'ve"", 'exhausted', 'rest', 'Asian', 'horror', 'rental', 'store', '***']",N/A

When the husband finds out he takes them in his yacht to confront them on the open sea. But restless spirits return to seek vengeance from beyond the grave.I believe this is the second show of the series to be helmed by a Japanese director and filmed on-location in Japan, the first being last season's controversial 'Imprint.' Compared to that 'Dream Cruise' is a much more conventional horror experience, though still an effective one. If you've ever seen other Asian horror films you know how creepy vengeful spirits can be, and there's some good scares and nerve-wracking tension here. It helps that all the players are linked to the same sin, and that each has an equal chance of falling to the spirit's wrath. And if death by drowning doesn't sound pleasant to you, there's even more to be scared about.Whereas other MoH installments have played up the camp, gore, and sex in lieu of actual scares, Dream Cruise contains little-to-none of the above but did keep me in decent suspense till the end (where admittedly, the ending gets predictable).

1097624,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B000UYX4P4,trebe,"[1, 1]","Directed by Norio Tsuruta (Premonition), Dream Cruise (2007) deals with some of the most common subjects of Japanese crime drama, murder, adultery, and revenge, and adds in the element of Japanese style ghost story, to produce a tale while somewhat predictable, is still entertaining.The DVD presentation is an extended 87 minute version of a story originally presented on Showtime's one hour Masters of Horror series.  The 26th episode in the series is also unusual, because it was shot in Japan, but features English as the spoken language, and primarily had a Japanese cast and production crew.  Actor Daniel Gillies, who is from New Zealand, is the only one of the primary stars who did not speak Japanese, and utilized translators to help him perform his role.Jack Miller (Giles) an attorney in Japan, is in a relationship with Yuri Saito (Yoshino Kimura), the wife of Eiji Saito (Ryo Ishibashi) one of his firm's biggest clients.  Jack needs to close a deal with Eiji, and although he has a great fear of the water, he accepts Eiji's invitation to take a cruise on his boat the ""Yuri"", to talk business.  Leaving Tokyo the ship heads out to sea.  Over dinner, the mood becomes quite tense, as it is clear that Eiji is aware of his wife's indiscretions, and that Jack has betrayed his trust.  Eiji is headed deeper out to sea, when supernatural forces act, and the ship develops engine trouble and stops.  Jack reveals to Yuri that his fear of the water, is a result of a childhood accident, where his younger brother Sean, drowned.The basic story is very familiar for Japanese crime dramas, where revenge for an act like adultery is a very common theme.  The supernatural aspect, featuring a vengeful ""obake"" (ghost), who seeks to torment victims, is also part of the Japanese tradition.  The special effects are nicely done, as the obake (Miho Ninagawa) who comes from up the depths of sea, has kind of a soft, wet, oozy look, to go along with a greenish glow to produce a rather creepy appearance.Ghost stories are seldom logical, and what is happening is a little hard to follow for a while, as a character that dies is possessed, but and appears normal, and a severed appendage comes to life, bent on homicide.  Later, another character that should have drowned twice, impossibly manages to survive.  Where the ghost of little brother Sean fits into the picture, remains unclear, but when that piece falls into place, it proves decisive.The contrast between east and west is evident in Dream Cruise, but the ability of Ryo Ishibashi (Audition (Uncut Special Edition)) and Yoshino Kimura to speak English pretty well, helps to smooth things over.  Daniel Gillies also had some challenging communication issues, but manages to overcome them.  The acting performances are edgy, and the direction strong, creating an atmosphere of suspense and fear, with a minimal amount of violence and blood.  The supernatural aspects, successfully turns a routine drama into a completely different place, as the ghost's behavior and the various apparitions, are largely unpredictable.  That unpredictability may confuse some, while others may find it refreshing.  The setting on a boat, creates a situation of complete and total isolation, although the scenes where the actors are swimming in the ocean (which were actually shot in a pool) are not as strong or realistic.The bonus material includes a making of featurette, photo gallery, and a commentary track featuring Daniel Gillies, and producer Mick Garris, that discusses many of the unique behind the scenes issues that occurred during the making of the film.  Asian style horror may not appeal to everyone, but with English as the featured language, this is a good introduction to the genre.",3,on the high seas with a mean green ghost...,1283904000,"09 8, 2010",2010,3742,"['Directed', 'Norio', 'Tsuruta', 'Premonition', 'Dream', 'Cruise', '2007', 'deals', 'most', 'common', 'subjects', 'Japanese', 'crime', 'drama', 'murder', 'adultery', 'revenge', 'element', 'Japanese', 'style', 'ghost', 'story', 'produce', 'tale', 'somewhat', 'predictable', 'still', 'entertaining.The', 'DVD', 'presentation', 'extended', '87', 'minute', 'version', 'story', 'originally', 'presented', 'Showtime', 'one', 'hour', 'Masters', 'Horror', 'series', '26th', 'episode', 'series', 'also', 'unusual', 'was', 'shot', 'Japan', 'English', 'spoken', 'language', 'primarily', 'had', 'Japanese', 'cast', 'production', 'crew', 'Actor', 'Daniel', 'Gillies', 'who', 'New', 'Zealand', 'only', 'one', 'primary', 'stars', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'speak', 'Japanese', 'utilized', 'translators', 'help', 'perform', 'role.Jack', 'Miller', 'Giles', 'attorney', 'Japan', 'relationship', 'Yuri', 'Saito', 'Yoshino', 'Kimura', 'wife', 'Eiji', 'Saito', 'Ryo', 'Ishibashi', 'one', 'firm', 'biggest', 'clients', 'Jack', 'close', 'deal', 'Eiji', 'great', 'fear', 'water', 'Eiji', 'invitation', 'take', 'cruise', 'boat', 'Yuri', 'talk', 'business', 'Leaving', 'Tokyo', 'ship', 'out', 'sea', 'dinner', 'mood', 'quite', 'tense', 'clear', 'Eiji', 'aware', 'wife', 'indiscretions', 'Jack', 'betrayed', 'trust', 'Eiji', 'headed', 'deeper', 'sea', 'when', 'supernatural', 'forces', 'act', 'ship', 'engine', 'trouble', 'stops', 'Jack', 'Yuri', 'fear', 'water', 'result', 'childhood', 'accident', 'where', 'younger', 'brother', 'Sean', 'drowned.The', 'basic', 'story', 'very', 'familiar', 'Japanese', 'crime', 'dramas', 'where', 'revenge', 'act', 'adultery', 'very', 'common', 'theme', 'supernatural', 'aspect', 'featuring', 'vengeful', 'obake', 'ghost', 'who', 'torment', 'victims', 'also', 'part', 'Japanese', 'tradition', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'nicely', 'done', 'obake', 'Miho', 'Ninagawa', 'who', 'depths', 'sea', 'kind', 'soft', 'wet', 'oozy', 'look', 'go', 'along', 'greenish', 'glow', 'produce', 'rather', 'creepy', 'appearance.Ghost', 'stories', 'are', 'seldom', 'logical', 'what', 'happening', 'little', 'hard', 'follow', 'while', 'character', 'possessed', 'normal', 'severed', 'appendage', 'life', 'bent', 'homicide', 'Later', 'character', 'should', 'have', 'drowned', 'twice', 'impossibly', 'survive', 'Where', 'ghost', 'little', 'brother', 'Sean', 'fits', 'picture', 'unclear', 'when', 'piece', 'place', 'decisive.The', 'contrast', 'east', 'west', 'evident', 'Dream', 'Cruise', 'ability', 'Ryo', 'Ishibashi', 'Audition', 'Uncut', 'Special', 'Edition', 'Yoshino', 'Kimura', 'speak', 'English', 'pretty', 'well', 'smooth', 'things', 'Daniel', 'Gillies', 'also', 'had', 'challenging', 'communication', 'issues', 'overcome', 'acting', 'performances', 'are', 'edgy', 'direction', 'strong', 'creating', 'atmosphere', 'suspense', 'fear', 'minimal', 'amount', 'violence', 'blood', 'supernatural', 'aspects', 'successfully', 'routine', 'drama', 'completely', 'different', 'place', 'ghost', 'behavior', 'various', 'apparitions', 'are', 'largely', 'unpredictable', 'unpredictability', 'may', 'confuse', 'others', 'may', 'find', 'refreshing', 'setting', 'boat', 'situation', 'complete', 'total', 'isolation', 'scenes', 'where', 'actors', 'are', 'swimming', 'ocean', 'were', 'actually', 'shot', 'pool', 'are', 'not', 'strong', 'realistic.The', 'bonus', 'material', 'making', 'featurette', 'photo', 'gallery', 'commentary', 'track', 'featuring', 'Daniel', 'Gillies', 'producer', 'Mick', 'Garris', 'many', 'unique', 'scenes', 'issues', 'occurred', 'making', 'film', 'Asian', 'style', 'horror', 'may', 'not', 'appeal', 'everyone', 'English', 'featured', 'language', 'good', 'introduction', 'genre']",N/A
