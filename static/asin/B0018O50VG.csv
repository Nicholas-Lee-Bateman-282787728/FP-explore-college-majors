The Orange Thief is Italian story of a thug whose life has been all about stealing oranges from the groves of Italy.  His life has been beatings for stealing fruit, but that's all he does, steal.Landing in jail, he meets Turrido, a murder, who makes a deal with him to record the music of his girlfriend, Rosalba.  This is his big dream, to have her music recorded.  Therefore, he employs the aid of his jailmate who will soon be released.  Turrido also promises the orange thief a piece of the land the thief has always dreamed of.It was a challenge to get Rosalba to sing.  He starts playing incorrectly to trick her to sing as she notices he is doing it wrong, and he gets help trying to get her to sing.  He records her, and the jailed guy listened to her, and he was inspired to become a musician.This group of people living through each others dreams, one helps the other.What you will see is some beautiful landscapes of the countryside. There is plenty of guitar music here, but it is not memorable.  The film has won some lesser known awardsAdditionally, all these 5 star ratings, but no one can tell you what the movie is about!!  Makes me wonder if anybody actually saw this boring film.  ....Rizzo",2,Not the comedy it proclaims to be,1290816000,"11 27, 2010",2010,1331,"['First', 'might', 'call', 'comedy', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'certainly', 'not', 'funny', 'not', 'slapstick', 'Orange', 'Thief', 'Italian', 'story', 'thug', 'life', 'been', 'stealing', 'oranges', 'groves', 'Italy', 'life', 'been', 'beatings', 'stealing', 'fruit', 'steal.Landing', 'jail', 'Turrido', 'murder', 'who', 'deal', 'record', 'music', 'girlfriend', 'Rosalba', 'big', 'dream', 'have', 'music', 'recorded', 'Therefore', 'aid', 'jailmate', 'who', 'will', 'soon', 'be', 'released', 'Turrido', 'also', 'orange', 'thief', 'piece', 'land', 'thief', 'always', 'dreamed', 'of.It', 'was', 'challenge', 'get', 'Rosalba', 'sing', 'playing', 'incorrectly', 'trick', 'sing', 'doing', 'wrong', 'help', 'trying', 'get', 'sing', 'jailed', 'guy', 'listened', 'was', 'inspired', 'become', 'musician.This', 'group', 'people', 'living', 'others', 'dreams', 'one', 'other.What', 'will', 'see', 'beautiful', 'landscapes', 'countryside', 'plenty', 'guitar', 'music', 'here', 'not', 'memorable', 'film', 'won', 'lesser', 'known', 'awardsAdditionally', '5', 'star', 'ratings', 'one', 'can', 'tell', 'what', 'movie', 'Makes', 'wonder', 'anybody', 'actually', 'saw', 'boring', 'film', '.Rizzo']",The Orange Thief

This is not allegory, not poetry, not even good fantasy.  A bunch of amateurs pretending to be film-makers.  They don't even seem to recognize the difference between an orange and an olive tree.  Save your money.  This is a waste and a big mess.

Growing up watching movies like Divorce and Marriage Italian Style, you cannot help but fall in love with Italian filmes.  Ironically, this is an Italian Film written by Americans and their love of Italian Cinema is present in every shot and line.  I came across this film by ""accident"" while searching Amazon for new Italian films that I might have missed like The Wedding Director.  And, with the latest Giuseppe Tornatore Baaria a HUGE disappointment, perhaps Giuseppe Tornatore should take note of The Orange Thief.  This film has love, heart, song, and romance in ways that we picture Italian cinema to be.  This film a such a treasure and I am deeply sorry that I never got a chance to experience it in a theater.

I was attracted by the cover of the DVD, nice color and font, so I decided to try it out. From the moment it started I was sucked in, the thief was great. A guy just looking for a chunk of land he can call his own. The songs are great, especially ""The little donkey,"" which I had to make a copy for myself in my notebook. You'll definitely want to take a trip to Sicily after watching, the film really captures the beauty of the country side. Perfect date film.
