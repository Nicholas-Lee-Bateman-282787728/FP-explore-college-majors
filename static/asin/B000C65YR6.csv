But first off, the cinematography, which was probably gorgeous on film looks like a bad VHS tape in this digitized version. All of the contrast is gone to hell, and you lose much of the detail and depth.The real problem is the script and the directing. While Hackman is his usual excellent self, the rest of the cast struggles to put life into some piss-poor lines. Even Gene struggles in an early scene with a pretty young prostitute. The action is so/so, and all in all it manages to be both predictable and routine. That's the real shame of the film, because some of the locations are beautiful, and the look of the film has a real authenticity.If it was an Amazon Prime deal, and not 6.99 I'd say give it a try for the opening scene alone. For seven bucks, I might suggest you see Van Damme's 'Legionnaire' instead if you need a fix of the Kepi blanc, but it's almost as cheesy, and doesn't have Gene Hackman.",2,Poor transfer does little to improve a poor film.,1393286400,"02 25, 2014",2014,999,"['should', 'love', 'film', 'like', 'films', 'era', 'subject', 'matter', 'cast', 'first', 'off', 'cinematography', 'was', 'probably', 'gorgeous', 'film', 'looks', 'bad', 'VHS', 'tape', 'digitized', 'version', 'contrast', 'gone', 'hell', 'lose', 'much', 'detail', 'depth.The', 'real', 'problem', 'script', 'directing', 'Hackman', 'usual', 'excellent', 'self', 'rest', 'cast', 'put', 'life', 'piss-poor', 'lines', 'Even', 'Gene', 'struggles', 'early', 'scene', 'pretty', 'young', 'prostitute', 'action', 'so/so', 'be', 'predictable', 'routine', 'real', 'shame', 'film', 'locations', 'are', 'beautiful', 'look', 'film', 'real', 'authenticity.If', 'was', 'Amazon', 'Prime', 'deal', 'not', '6.99', ""'d"", 'say', 'give', 'try', 'opening', 'scene', 'alone', 'seven', 'bucks', 'might', 'suggest', 'see', 'Van', 'Damme', ""'Legionnaire"", 'instead', 'need', 'fix', 'Kepi', 'blanc', 'almost', 'cheesy', ""n't"", 'have', 'Gene', 'Hackman']",Domino Principle/march Or Die
955200,A2FXOF63XOEHHN,B000C65YR6,Mark Marcon,"[15, 18]",It is strange that MoD has never been released in its full form. IMDB will tell you what is missing. Without seeing this version I can only surmise that since it is P&S-F/S (per the previous reviewer) then it is unrestored. What a shame that a full battle scene (during the desert journey) and the full ending (won't spoil it) has never been released. I do not believe that even the Euro releases have these edits.,3,Cut Version of March or Die???,1138147200,"01 25, 2006",2006,414,"['strange', 'MoD', 'never', 'been', 'released', 'full', 'form', 'IMDB', 'will', 'tell', 'what', 'missing', 'seeing', 'version', 'can', 'only', 'surmise', 'P', 'S-F/S', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'then', 'unrestored', 'What', 'shame', 'full', 'battle', 'scene', 'desert', 'journey', 'full', 'ending', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'never', 'been', 'released', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'even', 'Euro', 'releases', 'have', 'edits']",Domino Principle/march Or Die

955203,A2MNMZMM6BGLTA,B000C65YR6,"Uncle Chino ""Johnny""","[16, 16]",This review is of the second feature of this double feature disk 'March or Die' with Gene Hackman and Terrance Hill. A friend of mine mentioned that he saw this movie about 30 years ago when I was just a kid. I never saw it until just now. Let me start with a minor complaint. I do like these 'double feature' disks especially the ones that have movies that are not well known as both of these are. But I must say that they didn't put a lot in to producing this DVD. The copy quality is not all that great. It is definitely watchable but it looks like somebody copied it off of TV and then transfered it. That being said the thing that saved the movie is the great story and acting. I was throughly enthralled by this tail of the French Foreign Legion and I thought it was an excellent flick. The climactic battle scene reminded me a lot of the movie Zulu's final battle. And the build up to the last violent battle is done really well. Gene Hackman plays a very good tough as nails ramrod of a commanding officer and Terrance Hill is perfect in the role of the charismatic charmer who joins The Legion so as not to go to jail.You may have issues with the production but I can't and don't have any problems with the film itself. I enjoyed it very much.,4,Forgotten Gem,1190419200,"09 22, 2007",2007,1252,"['review', 'second', 'feature', 'double', 'feature', 'disk', ""'March"", 'Die', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'Terrance', 'Hill', 'A', 'friend', 'mine', 'mentioned', 'saw', 'movie', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'was', 'just', 'kid', 'never', 'saw', 'just', 'now', 'Let', 'start', 'minor', 'complaint', 'do', ""'double"", 'feature', 'disks', 'especially', 'ones', 'have', 'movies', 'are', 'not', 'well', 'known', 'are', 'must', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'put', 'lot', 'producing', 'DVD', 'copy', 'quality', 'not', 'great', 'definitely', 'watchable', 'somebody', 'copied', 'TV', 'then', 'transfered', 'being', 'said', 'thing', 'saved', 'movie', 'great', 'story', 'acting', 'was', 'throughly', 'enthralled', 'tail', 'French', 'Foreign', 'Legion', 'thought', 'was', 'excellent', 'flick', 'climactic', 'battle', 'scene', 'reminded', 'lot', 'movie', 'Zulu', 'final', 'battle', 'build', 'up', 'last', 'violent', 'battle', 'done', 'really', 'well', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'very', 'good', 'tough', 'nails', 'ramrod', 'commanding', 'officer', 'Terrance', 'Hill', 'perfect', 'role', 'charismatic', 'charmer', 'who', 'Legion', 'so', 'not', 'go', 'jail.You', 'may', 'have', 'issues', 'production', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'problems', 'film', 'enjoyed', 'very', 'much']",Domino Principle/march Or Die
955204,A16DFPRFMPA9LP,B000C65YR6,"ZANZIBAR ""Hotep""","[2, 2]","This is a French Foreign Legion movie with some flavor, March or Die that is. Great scenic viewing, it looked realistic. Gene Hackman was great as always in the lead role. This movie can give the viewer an education on the charasmatic Moroccan leader Abd el-Krim and the Riff wars 1911-1927, they portray him as an honorable and noble yet brutal leader. March or Die can be used as somewhat of a history lesson for this period in world events.
