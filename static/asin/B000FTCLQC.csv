995679,A25UZ7MA72SMKM,B000FTCLQC,Brent Butler,"[0, 0]","I won't spend a lot of time on Firecreek, because it is far from my favorite Stewart vehicle. Here he is sort of a part time town sheriff trying to stand up to a gang (led by Henry Fonda) which has arrived in town and more or less rules the roost during their stay. Fonda plays a restrained but very bad man. Why he tolerates Stewart's sheriff instead of just shooting him down is a bit of a mystery. This is the type of gritty, character driven western that I never really enjoyed, and that was true of this one, even tho the male leads are two of my all time favorite actors.Cheyenne Social Club is a nice visit with two favorites, though. Starting with a wonderful gossipy monologue by Fonda, the movie highlights a friendship between two very average career cowboys. When Stewart inherits a house of ill repute from his brother, he feels that closing it down is ""the right thing to do"". This presents a series of problems. The story is quite predictable, but the movie is filled with gentle good humor that makes for an enjoyable watch.I had always seen this movie in syndicated showings on regular TV stations.

Cheyenne Social Club features Stewart as John O'Hanlon and Fonda as Harley Sullivan, two rough and tumble veteran Texas cowboys whose lives revolve around endless cattle drives and the stoic and simple life on the open range of the West.O'Hanlon's brother D.J. dies and leaves him as the sole owner/proprietor of the Cheyenne Social Club, the most notorious brothel in the wild west. Fonda tags along for the ride as Stewart rides the 1000 mile journey to claim his inheritance. The men of Cheyenne consider the Social Club as a hallowed and precious shrine. O'Hanlon is shocked to discover the real meaning of his inheritance and announces to the madam, artfully played by Shirley Jones, and her bevy of beautiful women that he intends to close the brothel and open a respectable boarding house in it's place.The firestorm against O'Hanlon by the townspeople and his employees begins a tour de force comedy romp with the befuddled Stewart trying to weather the storm while Sullivan watches bemused from the sidelines. This movie features two veteran actors and a superb supporting cast at their very best. The sex is suggested rather than ""in your face"" like today's movies, but gets the sexual points across gracefully without being crude, graphic or clumsy.The end result of O'Hanlon's adventure is a classic cautionary tale of being careful what you wish for-you just might get it! The movie is bittersweet, ironic, and emotional without being maudlin, and shows why these stars from the golden age of Hollywood films set the standard for great acting and class performances.While Fonda and Stewart give great performances in Firecreek, I find this movie to be rather Hollywood formula and too close to ""High Noon"" in the concept of the story. But, if you love Fonda and Stewart as actors, it's hard not to like how these legendary actors tell the story, as rivals pitted against each other on opposite sides of the law. The problem is not the actors, but the story they have been given has been done before. So they have little room to breathe fresh life and a new perspective into a basic formula western.What Stewart does so well is make you sympathetic and willing to support his underdog character. He must use his wit and grit to overcome evil men and seemingly insurmountable odds, a classic position for Stewart in so many movies. Fonda gives a credible performance as the ""bad-guy"", but his performance in that type of role in such classics as ""Once Upon A time in the West"" gave him a better vehicle to explore his turn as an evil and criminal man with no scruples and little compassion.",5,Tour de force performances by two Hollywood legends,1195689600,"11 22, 2007",2007,2958,"['many', 'movies', 'made', 'today', 'Cheyenne', 'Social', 'Club', 'Firecreek', 'pit', 'two', 'veteran', 'actors', 'consummate', 'skill', 'ability', 'tell', 'story', 'special', 'effects', 'unnecessary-the', 'quality', 'story', 'acting', 'carry', 'movies.Both', 'films', 'feature', 'great', 'supporting', 'casts', 'Fonda', 'Stewart', 'show', 'why', 'qualify', 'screen', 'legends', 'scene', 'Cheyenne', 'Social', 'Club', 'Stewart', 'John', ""O'Hanlon"", 'Fonda', 'Harley', 'Sullivan', 'two', 'rough', 'tumble', 'veteran', 'Texas', 'lives', 'revolve', 'endless', 'cattle', 'drives', 'stoic', 'simple', 'life', 'open', 'range', ""West.O'Hanlon"", 'brother', 'D.J', 'dies', 'sole', 'owner/proprietor', 'Cheyenne', 'Social', 'Club', 'most', 'notorious', 'brothel', 'wild', 'west', 'Fonda', 'ride', 'Stewart', '1000', 'mile', 'journey', 'claim', 'inheritance', 'men', 'Cheyenne', 'consider', 'Social', 'Club', 'hallowed', 'precious', 'shrine', ""O'Hanlon"", 'shocked', 'discover', 'real', 'meaning', 'inheritance', 'announces', 'madam', 'artfully', 'played', 'Shirley', 'Jones', 'bevy', 'beautiful', 'women', 'close', 'brothel', 'open', 'respectable', 'boarding', 'house', 'place.The', 'firestorm', ""O'Hanlon"", 'townspeople', 'employees', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'comedy', 'romp', 'befuddled', 'Stewart', 'trying', 'weather', 'storm', 'Sullivan', 'watches', 'bemused', 'sidelines', 'movie', 'two', 'veteran', 'actors', 'superb', 'supporting', 'cast', 'very', 'best', 'sex', 'suggested', 'rather', 'face', 'today', 'movies', 'sexual', 'points', 'gracefully', 'being', 'crude', 'graphic', 'clumsy.The', 'end', 'result', ""O'Hanlon"", 'adventure', 'classic', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'being', 'careful', 'what', 'wish', 'for-you', 'just', 'might', 'get', 'movie', 'bittersweet', 'ironic', 'emotional', 'being', 'maudlin', 'why', 'stars', 'golden', 'age', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'set', 'standard', 'great', 'acting', 'class', 'performances.While', 'Fonda', 'Stewart', 'give', 'great', 'performances', 'Firecreek', 'find', 'movie', 'be', 'rather', 'Hollywood', 'formula', 'too', 'close', 'High', 'Noon', 'concept', 'story', 'love', 'Fonda', 'Stewart', 'actors', 'hard', 'not', 'like', 'how', 'legendary', 'actors', 'tell', 'story', 'rivals', 'pitted', 'other', 'opposite', 'sides', 'law', 'problem', 'not', 'actors', 'story', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'been', 'done', 'before', 'have', 'little', 'room', 'breathe', 'fresh', 'life', 'new', 'perspective', 'basic', 'formula', 'western.What', 'Stewart', 'so', 'well', 'make', 'sympathetic', 'willing', 'support', 'underdog', 'character', 'must', 'use', 'wit', 'grit', 'overcome', 'evil', 'men', 'seemingly', 'insurmountable', 'odds', 'classic', 'position', 'Stewart', 'so', 'many', 'movies', 'Fonda', 'credible', 'performance', 'bad-guy', 'performance', 'type', 'role', 'such', 'classics', 'Once', 'A', 'time', 'West', 'gave', 'better', 'vehicle', 'explore', 'turn', 'evil', 'criminal', 'man', 'scruples', 'little', 'compassion']",N/A
995687,A1JWSDDIH5Z7DV,B000FTCLQC,D. R. Schryer,"[41, 44]","Henry Fonda and Jimmie Stewart were two of the greatest, most versatile, actors of the Golden Age of movies. Unfortunately, some people tend to dismiss Jimmy Stewart as a somewhat lightweight actor because of the low-key aw-shucks acting style he used in some of his early movies. But, after his service as a bomber pilot in WWII, Stewart's performances toughened up considerably, as his performance in Firecreek clearly shows. Henry Fonda, on the other hand, was an oustanding and highly versatile actor throughout his entire career and, in retrospect, may well have been THE greatest movie actor ever. The two quite different movies on this DVD -- the brutal western Firecreek and the superbly-comedic somewhat-bawdy western The Cheyenne Social Club -- illustrate Fonda's incredible ability to completely assume whatever role he portrayed without any hint of acting. Unfortunately Henry Fonda and Jimmie Stewart, despite being close friends, made few movies together. This DVD presents these two legendary actors together in two excellent, but entirely different, westerns. My personal favorite of the two movies presented on this DVD is The Cheyenne Social Club, perhaps because I prefer comedy to violence, and perhaps because it allows these real-life friends to portray friends rather than implacable enemies as in Firecreek.

The pair works well together in very different roles.The first is a comedy and the second is a drama. In the first they are buddies, in the second they are enemies. In both, they are splendid.Individual reviews appear below:THE CHEYENNE SOCIAL CLUBThis One's a HootJimmy Stewart and Henry Fonda play a couple of cowboys working on the range. When Stewart gets a letter he is surprised to learn that his bother has died and left him his business. It is a placed called the Cheyenne Social Club. So it is that Stewart and his sidekick, Fonda, set out for Wyoming with the expectation of becoming respectable business men.Upon arrival, Stewart learns that he is the most popular and respected man in town. He also learns that his social club is a brothel. This strikes him as not being ""in his line of work"" and he determines to close the place down. That takes him from being the most respected to the most reviled man in town. He has some hard decisions to make and even more trouble appears when he learns that there are contractual agreements between his shop and the railroad. Things get more complicated still when he learns that there are some ruffians roughing up some of his girls.Stewart is just a nice guy trying to do the ""right thing"". Eventually, he does...much to his own surprise.FIRECREEKSometimes the Little Guys WinThis is another pairing of Jimmy Stewart and Henry Fonda in a western.Stewart plays a farmer, respected by his peers and given the honorary title of sheriff in his town. The tile also comes with a home made tin badge and 20 dollars. It is a sign of esteem and nothing more.Fonda plays the leader of a group of gunmen with vague notions about law and order. When passing through town, they decide to stop there a little while and rest. Nobody really minds that but they do object to being treated like vermin by the gunmen who get a bit wild when they drink. Fonda does not really approve of what they do but is reluctant to come down on them too hard for fear of alienating them. That means that it is up to the sheriff to keep order.Keeping order is a hard job. He is not trained and he is certainly no gunfighter. He is just a farmer. The townspeople encourage him just to ignore things in the hope that the bad guys will eventually go away. All are frightened. When a friend is lynched, though, Stewart decides that enough is enough and takes on the whole gang.This is one of those films in which the little guy manages to stand up to the bully, survive and even win. It comes at a cost, though.",4,Two Good Pairings,1169510400,"01 23, 2007",2007,2606,"['disk', 'two', 'westerns', 'staring', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'pair', 'well', 'together', 'very', 'different', 'roles.The', 'first', 'comedy', 'second', 'drama', 'first', 'are', 'buddies', 'second', 'are', 'enemies', 'are', 'splendid.Individual', 'reviews', 'appear', 'CHEYENNE', 'SOCIAL', 'CLUBThis', 'One', 'HootJimmy', 'Stewart', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'play', 'couple', 'cowboys', 'working', 'range', 'When', 'Stewart', 'letter', 'surprised', 'learn', 'bother', 'died', 'left', 'business', 'placed', 'called', 'Cheyenne', 'Social', 'Club', 'Stewart', 'sidekick', 'Fonda', 'set', 'out', 'Wyoming', 'expectation', 'becoming', 'respectable', 'business', 'men.Upon', 'arrival', 'Stewart', 'most', 'popular', 'respected', 'man', 'town', 'also', 'social', 'club', 'brothel', 'not', 'being', 'line', 'work', 'close', 'place', 'down', 'being', 'most', 'respected', 'most', 'reviled', 'man', 'town', 'hard', 'decisions', 'make', 'even', 'more', 'trouble', 'when', 'are', 'contractual', 'agreements', 'shop', 'railroad', 'Things', 'get', 'more', 'complicated', 'still', 'when', 'are', 'ruffians', 'roughing', 'up', 'girls.Stewart', 'just', 'nice', 'guy', 'trying', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'Eventually', 'much', 'own', 'surprise.FIRECREEKSometimes', 'Little', 'Guys', 'WinThis', 'pairing', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'western.Stewart', 'farmer', 'respected', 'peers', 'given', 'honorary', 'title', 'sheriff', 'town', 'tile', 'also', 'home', 'made', 'tin', 'badge', '20', 'dollars', 'sign', 'esteem', 'nothing', 'more.Fonda', 'leader', 'group', 'gunmen', 'vague', 'notions', 'law', 'order', 'When', 'passing', 'town', 'decide', 'stop', 'little', 'while', 'rest', 'Nobody', 'really', 'do', 'object', 'being', 'treated', 'vermin', 'gunmen', 'who', 'get', 'bit', 'wild', 'when', 'drink', 'Fonda', 'not', 'really', 'approve', 'what', 'do', 'reluctant', 'come', 'down', 'too', 'hard', 'fear', 'alienating', 'sheriff', 'keep', 'order.Keeping', 'order', 'hard', 'job', 'not', 'trained', 'certainly', 'gunfighter', 'just', 'farmer', 'townspeople', 'encourage', 'just', 'ignore', 'things', 'hope', 'bad', 'guys', 'will', 'eventually', 'go', 'away', 'are', 'frightened', 'When', 'friend', 'lynched', 'Stewart', 'enough', 'enough', 'whole', 'gang.This', 'one', 'films', 'little', 'guy', 'manages', 'stand', 'up', 'bully', 'survive', 'even', 'win', 'cost', 'though']",N/A

Its simple plot incorporates the  timeless and very important message that we ought to take a stand in this world! ""The day a man decides not to face the world is the day he better step out of it!""Jimmy Stewart is Johnny Cobb, a farmer and a part-time sheriff of Firecreek and Henry Fonda is Larkin, a hired killer, who passes through the town with his gang.

995697,A25FOKK65M7HTW,B000FTCLQC,Koreatown Krooner,"[2, 5]","Both films are beautifully restored and presented in letterbox format.  The colors, the photography, especially the night shooting in ""Firecreek"" are excellent.  Of the two, ""Firecreek"" is the standout.  ""Firecreek"" is a simple ""High Noon"" story with cowardly townspeople unwilling to take a stand against a gang of invading outlaws.  Henry Fonda plays a fine hangdog villain and gang boss and James Stewart is the reluctant hero faced with his own moral and spiritual crisis.  ""Firecreek"" lacks the taught script and perfect pacing of ""High Noon"", but it's also less manipulative and contains more careful character development.  I've always thought ""High Noon"" was too political for its own good.  No worries of that here.  This is just a good western with solid opposing characters who must have it out.  The weaker film of the set is ""The Cheyenne Social Club"".  It is quite dated, silly, corny, cute and sexist in that old fashioned Hollywood way.  The ladies are lovely and busty prostitutes with hearts of gold.  James Stewart plays the plain cowhand who is thrust into pimpdom after his deceased brother leaves him a bordello as part of his estate.  Henry Fonda is very amusing as Stewart's close friend.  Fonda has less lines but always seems to get the laugh just by cracking a nut, grinning or twinkling his eyes.

Although I'd be remiss not to mention ""My Name Is Nobody"", ""Fail-Safe"" and ""The Lady Eve"" in the same breath.Real-life friends Jimmy Stewart and Henry Fonda play a pair of grizzled old cowpokes earning a meager living herding cattle. John O'Hanlan and incessant jabber-monkey Harley Sullivan, good buddies who are about to have their lives upended and altered with the delivery of a letter.John has learned that his brother, whom he hasn't seen or heard from since they were young men, has passed away. Over those many years D.J. O'Hanlan amassed quite a fortune. And with his passing, Ol' John has inherited his entire estate; wealth in the form of a town's social club - the building, its contents and furnishings are all his - including a fat bank account. John has just retired. All he has to do is go and collect it.Back in the day before cars, roads and rails - the horse was the primary means of transport. So a trip that would take five or six hours today would be a two or three month journey over rough untamed wilderness. And his ever-chattering, walnut-cracking buddy Harley figures: Well shoot, why not take the trip too? Much to the chagrin of John, who is indeed his friend, but hilariously one who wishes his friend would shut the hell up once in while. Months of constant yakkity-yak is enough to drive even the most temperate of people to violence.As the pair enter Cheyenne, it's made clear that John O'Hanlan is a person of polarizing interest. From the cheeriest warm welcomes to the frostiest of dismissals. Since he's never been to the town or met any of these people, neither cowboy can explain why.When he takes possession of the ""social club"" - suddenly, it's all too clear why anyone with the last name of O'Hanlan elicits such strong reactions from the townfolk.Conflict soon erupts as everyone suddenly realizes John isn't his free-spirited brother. Surprisingly prudish, a moralizing aspect of his personality comes out. Much to the chagrin of the women who call the club their home and the guests, some of whom endure traveling hundreds of miles to enjoy the company of Shirley Jones and friends. Even his old friend Harley is quite put off by his buddy's position that the ""social"" aspect has to stop.Exceedingly enjoyable comedy with both movie veterans showcasing the casual ease garnered over a lifetime in the craft.Personal Notes:- Common knowledge now with the internet, but back in the day and for many years, I was the only cinephile that knew this is the only film in which Jimmy Stewart has a theatrical scene with a nude female.

I did watch CSC the other night and I was a little disappointed with the video quality. The quality was only fair, and not near the quality of most DVDs that I buy. I believe one reason for this is despite what the description says, this is not a 2-disc set, these movies are on a single, 2-sided disc. I always avoid these because of all the problems with 2-sided discs. This is not the first time that Amazon has inaccurately described a listing, and they need to do better.

995717,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B000FTCLQC,Trevor Willsmer,"[4, 5]","Firecreek probably wouldn't stand a chance in today's market - it's a film dominated by old men with a script that's a very slow burner. Indeed, it's not until the superb last half hour that the film really starts punching its weight. For much of the film, Henry Fonda's gang of hired guns who drift into the one-dog town of Firecreek are more annoyance than genuine threat, but with each incident defused only by a display of anything-for-a-quiet life weakness from the townsfolk and James Stewart's part-time sheriff, violence is inevitable. What is surprising are the character revelations en route: every single character who drifts into this waste basket for lost souls is a wholly inadequate human being in one way or another. Fonda is quietly impressive as a man who can only maintain the authority he needs to stop him from being a nobody by never exercising it and by giving in to his gang's wishes to prevent them replacing him. Stewart at first seems too old for the part, but as the film progresses his casting makes more and more sense: as Dean Jagger points out in the film's best scene, this is a town of losers, people who'll settle for what nobody else wants because they know no-one will challenge them for it. Or as Gary Lockwood's young gun puts it, ""Ain't nothin' in this town five dollars won't fix."" Surprisingly good, and much better directed by Vincent McEveety than you'd expect from a director who spent most of his career commuting between Disney comedies and TV shows.The DVD has a good 2.35:1 widescreen transfer but the only extra is the original trailer.Stewart and Fonda's subsequent Western teaming is an altogether more comic affair. The Cheyenne Social Club is a brothel that Stewart's staunchly Republican cowpoke inherits from his wastrel brother, much to his discomfort and the delight of his garrulous sidekick Fonda, who displays a surprising gift for comedy that easily outshines his co-star. It's more cosy than risqu&eacute; and Gene Kelly's direction is more professional than inspired, but it's a pleasant enough amble even if the jokes are slight and run out somewhere around the one hour mark.The 2.35:1 transfer is good, but despite sharing the same cinematographer the look of the film is much softer.

The Cheyenne Social Club has Humor, Drama, situational encounters, and makes you want to watch this film more than once.  It is also suitable for most family members - say over 10yrs. old.  Stewart and Fonda are decade old Trail Buddy Cowboys who are true ""COWBOYS"" from Texas.  Stewart inherits the Cheyenne Social Club from his deceased Brother - in Cheyenne, WY.  After their trek from Texas to Wyoming, they literally did not know the Social Club was actually a very honored Cat House..., the trials & tribulations start from there in good clean humor, with drama following certain Bad Guys who want to eliminate Stewart in revenge.Firecreek is an opposite plot.  Fonda is a ruthless Bad Guy, Stewart is a Farmer with a pregnant wife ready to give birth, and he is also sort of ""the Sheriff"" in this very small & poor town.  Fonda and his gang terrorize this small town to do what they want, to whom they want without anyone else having the courage to stand up to these outlaws.
