1692708,A2PV6GK1HV54Y9,B00HW3EZZE,ADRIENNE MILLER,"[1, 1]","Barefoot starring Scott Speedman and Evan Rachel Wood is a quirky and sweet drama. I've had a huge crush on Scott Speedman since his days on late '90s drama, Felicity. He's easy on the eyes, his voice is whisper soft, and he's highly underrated! In Barefoot, he stars as Jay, a janitor at a psychiatric hospital who's also a troublemaker. Jay comes from a wealthy family but he's not the most responsible man and he acts without thinking. While working, he meets Daisy played by Evan Rachel Wood. Daisy is a new patient at the hospital and Jay forms an unexpected bond with her but there's a catch. Jay is looking for a date so he can attend his brother's wedding in New Orleans and he's running out of women he might possibly take to ""show off"" in front of his family, and that's when he decides to take Daisy along and she pretends to be a nurse he's currently dating. Along the way, we learn the truth about Daisy. About why she ended up at that hospital and so on and so forth. And who knew Evan had killer, comedic timing!? She's very funny as Daisy, all wide-eyed and innocent but with enough spunk to pull off the amazing one-liners. I also thought Speedman and Wood have wonderful chemistry together especially during the carnival scene. This film is beautifully directed by Andrew Fleming. I've seen some of his other films and he's a great, gifted director. I highly recommend this sweet coming-of-age, indie flick. Enjoy! Oh, in case you were wondering why this film is called Barefoot, Daisy looks to walk around barefoot - she hates wearing shoes.

1692709,A33NKF3Y0CRGCQ,B00HW3EZZE,Amari Sali,"[1, 2]","Trigger Warning(s): Mental Illness depictionsDespite not reviewing a lot of Evan Rachel Wood productions, I must say that I am quite the fan of hers. If just because each of her characters have an interesting angle to them. For while some of her movies certainly are boring, she presents herself as a sort of silver lining. With this film though, she plays a character which has the persona of a troubled Disney princess who meets her would-be prince who is far from a knight in shining armor. Leading to the question: is this another one of those films in which she is the silver lining, or is the film good as a whole?Characters & StoryThe film&#8217;s primary focus is on Jay (Scott Speedman) who is the eldest son of a rich southern family. Now, despite Jay&#8217;s MBA education, and his privileged upbringing, it seems all he has ever been was the rebel without a cause. So, to distance himself from his last major blemish on the family name, he moves out west and ends up getting in trouble with not just the law, but also the mob. But with his younger brother getting married, and Jay trying to seem like he has his life put together, there is a need to show that he has even began the process of settling down. Enter Daisy (Evan Rachel Wood) who is a new mental patient at the hospital Jay works at. They mutually take advantage of each other and somehow find love between putting up a ruse and trying to deal with the police in pursuit of both of them.PraiseAs usual, Wood presents herself as a highlight and presents Daisy as this kooky, but likeable, character who despite being rather simple does have some complexity. For while she does have this Disney princess persona, because she was sheltered all her life, abused by her mother, and pretty much is a weirdo, at the same time you can see her grow as she interacts with Jay. And through him she starts discovering, bit by bit, what it means to love someone, and deal with challenges that come with someone being your whole world while you are simply a part of theirs.And the story as a whole, while certainly not the best, it does keep things interesting. Something which leads Speedman to deserve some praise for while perhaps not the most charismatic, he plays a decent enough love interest to Wood to at least make their relationship something of interest for the film.CriticismWith all that said though, I really do feel that me being a fan of Wood was the sole thing that kept me interested in this movie. For one, Jay&#8217;s whole backstory really feels underdeveloped. Be it his issues with the mob, why he is on probation, and I also felt like there should have been more to his issues with his dad than lost money. Then, even with Wood, there is sort of a double-edged sword to her character. For while I like the whole Disney princess persona, at the same time it does make you wonder, based off characters Wood has played in the past, why would she play someone like this? For while Daisy arguably can be complex, on face value she comes off so simple it sort of amazes you that she is even capable of half of what Jay asks of her. And honestly, as cute as her ditzy ways can come off, at the same time I can imagine Wood&#8217;s performance possibly leading to some rolling their eyes.Overall: TV ViewingAs I watched this I thought I would label this as &#8220;Worth Seeing.&#8221; However, as I wrote the review and really thought about the weak aspects of the film, I felt the need to downgrade it. After all, with Wood&#8217;s performance being the highlight, but not one which has universal appeal, it makes this hard to recommend as &#8220;worth seeing.&#8221; So, because of that, I think this is simply a &#8220;TV Viewing&#8221; type movie. For while I liked Daisy, the underdeveloped background of Jay does put a hamper on things, as well as Daisy perhaps being too simple.",3,"Imagine a Rapunzel inspired film in which there is just a wicked mother, and a prince who helps turn the would-be princess&#8217; life",1403827200,"06 27, 2014",2014,3862,"['Trigger', 'Warning', 's', 'Mental', 'Illness', 'depictionsDespite', 'not', 'reviewing', 'lot', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'productions', 'must', 'say', 'am', 'quite', 'fan', 'hers', 'just', 'characters', 'have', 'interesting', 'angle', 'movies', 'certainly', 'are', 'boring', 'sort', 'silver', 'lining', 'film', 'character', 'persona', 'troubled', 'Disney', 'princess', 'who', 'would-be', 'prince', 'who', 'far', 'knight', 'shining', 'armor', 'Leading', 'question', 'one', 'films', 'silver', 'lining', 'film', 'good', 'whole', 'Characters', 'StoryThe', 'film', '8217', 'primary', 'focus', 'Jay', 'Scott', 'Speedman', 'who', 'eldest', 'son', 'rich', 'southern', 'family', 'Now', 'Jay', '8217', 'MBA', 'education', 'privileged', 'upbringing', 'ever', 'been', 'was', 'rebel', 'cause', 'So', 'distance', 'last', 'major', 'blemish', 'family', 'name', 'out', 'west', 'up', 'getting', 'trouble', 'not', 'just', 'law', 'also', 'mob', 'younger', 'brother', 'getting', 'married', 'Jay', 'trying', 'seem', 'life', 'put', 'together', 'need', 'show', 'even', 'began', 'process', 'settling', 'down', 'Enter', 'Daisy', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'who', 'new', 'mental', 'patient', 'hospital', 'Jay', 'mutually', 'take', 'advantage', 'other', 'somehow', 'find', 'love', 'putting', 'up', 'ruse', 'trying', 'deal', 'police', 'pursuit', 'them.PraiseAs', 'usual', 'Wood', 'highlight', 'presents', 'Daisy', 'kooky', 'likeable', 'character', 'who', 'being', 'rather', 'simple', 'have', 'complexity', 'have', 'Disney', 'princess', 'persona', 'was', 'sheltered', 'life', 'abused', 'mother', 'pretty', 'much', 'weirdo', 'same', 'time', 'can', 'see', 'grow', 'Jay', 'discovering', 'bit', 'bit', 'what', 'love', 'someone', 'deal', 'challenges', 'come', 'someone', 'being', 'whole', 'world', 'are', 'simply', 'part', 'theirs.And', 'story', 'whole', 'certainly', 'not', 'best', 'keep', 'things', 'interesting', 'Something', 'Speedman', 'deserve', 'praise', 'perhaps', 'not', 'most', 'charismatic', 'decent', 'enough', 'love', 'interest', 'Wood', 'least', 'make', 'relationship', 'something', 'interest', 'film.CriticismWith', 'said', 'really', 'do', 'feel', 'being', 'fan', 'Wood', 'was', 'sole', 'thing', 'kept', 'interested', 'movie', 'one', 'Jay', '8217', 's', 'whole', 'backstory', 'really', 'underdeveloped', 'Be', 'issues', 'mob', 'why', 'probation', 'also', 'felt', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'issues', 'dad', 'lost', 'money', 'Then', 'even', 'Wood', 'sort', 'double-edged', 'sword', 'character', 'like', 'whole', 'Disney', 'princess', 'persona', 'same', 'time', 'make', 'wonder', 'based', 'off', 'characters', 'Wood', 'played', 'past', 'why', 'would', 'play', 'someone', 'Daisy', 'arguably', 'can', 'be', 'complex', 'face', 'value', 'off', 'so', 'simple', 'sort', 'amazes', 'even', 'capable', 'half', 'what', 'Jay', 'honestly', 'as', 'cute', 'ditzy', 'ways', 'can', 'come', 'off', 'same', 'time', 'can', 'imagine', 'Wood', '8217', 's', 'performance', 'possibly', 'leading', 'rolling', 'eyes.Overall', 'TV', 'ViewingAs', 'watched', 'thought', 'would', 'label', '8220', 'Worth', 'Seeing.', '8221', 'However', 'wrote', 'review', 'really', 'thought', 'weak', 'aspects', 'film', 'felt', 'need', 'downgrade', 'Wood', '8217', 's', 'performance', 'being', 'highlight', 'not', 'one', 'universal', 'appeal', 'hard', 'recommend', '8220', 'worth', 'seeing.', '8221', 'think', 'simply', '8220', 'TV', 'Viewing', '8221', 'type', 'movie', 'liked', 'Daisy', 'underdeveloped', 'background', 'Jay', 'put', 'hamper', 'things', 'as', 'well', 'Daisy', 'perhaps', 'being', 'too', 'simple']",Barefoot Digital

1692721,AIO247KHD2O40,B00HW3EZZE,James N Simpson,"[0, 0]","Barefoot is basically, a self-centred guy grows a conscience and actually starts to care about someone else type movie. Similar in a way to the fake father character and his journey in We're the Millers.  That someone else is Daisy, a woman in her mid-twenties/thirties I guess who up to a few days before, when she asked her postman what she should do with her mother's corpse, had lived a life of isolation from the rest of the world, where her mother had told her all kinds of nonsense, such as driving a car will get you pregnant.  The postman conversation has ended up with her now being in a mental institution where our self centred guy is working mopping the floor as part of his parole terms.  She knows of him simply as Mop Man.  However when he's clocking off one day he overhears someone claiming to be a doctor obviously about to rape her and violently intervenes. She follows him out the door.Mop Man or Jay (played by Scott Speedman) has problems of his own, he's in debt to loan sharks and needs to con his rich family at his brother's wedding into giving him enough money to pay the debt.  He had planned on hiring a stripper to pretend to be a nurse he met at work to help with that plan. But being an unlikeable guy, (although we have seen glimpse of him caring about the patients and treating them as friends at the institute,) even the strippers don't want a thing to do with him. So his only solution is to try and pass Daisy off as the nurse.Barefoot is a feel good film that keeps you glued simply as Daisy is such a likeable character (superbly acted by Evan Rachel Wood). She has a very childlike innocence about her, is eager to please and cares so much about those she comes in contact with, such as a little girl dropping flowers.  You care about her as the events proceed and sort of want to protect her yourself.  There are huge plot holes in the film, such as police seeming not to have CB radios (or even their own mobile phones) to radio other officers.  But because you care so much about the Daisy character, you sort of let those slide and not get in the way of the journey. Speedman does a pretty good job in his role too.If this film had been a bit more successful I think the old restored campervan (RV) would have become a classic movie vehicle as well.",4,Very Likeable Character Makes You Not Mind So Much About Obvious Plot Holes,1404172800,"07 1, 2014",2014,2294,"['Barefoot', 'basically', 'self-centred', 'guy', 'conscience', 'actually', 'care', 'someone', 'else', 'type', 'movie', 'Similar', 'way', 'fake', 'father', 'character', 'journey', ""'re"", 'Millers', 'someone', 'else', 'Daisy', 'woman', 'mid-twenties/thirties', 'guess', 'who', 'up', 'few', 'days', 'before', 'when', 'asked', 'postman', 'what', 'should', 'do', 'mother', 'corpse', 'had', 'lived', 'life', 'isolation', 'rest', 'world', 'where', 'mother', 'had', 'told', 'kinds', 'nonsense', 'such', 'driving', 'car', 'will', 'get', 'pregnant', 'postman', 'conversation', 'ended', 'up', 'now', 'being', 'mental', 'institution', 'where', 'self', 'centred', 'guy', 'working', 'mopping', 'floor', 'part', 'parole', 'terms', 'simply', 'Mop', 'Man', 'However', 'when', 'clocking', 'off', 'one', 'day', 'someone', 'claiming', 'be', 'doctor', 'obviously', 'rape', 'violently', 'intervenes', 'out', 'door.Mop', 'Man', 'Jay', 'played', 'Scott', 'Speedman', 'problems', 'own', 'debt', 'loan', 'sharks', 'needs', 'con', 'rich', 'family', 'brother', 'wedding', 'giving', 'enough', 'money', 'pay', 'debt', 'had', 'planned', 'hiring', 'stripper', 'pretend', 'be', 'nurse', 'met', 'work', 'help', 'plan', 'being', 'unlikeable', 'guy', 'have', 'seen', 'glimpse', 'caring', 'patients', 'treating', 'friends', 'institute', 'even', 'strippers', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'thing', 'do', 'So', 'only', 'solution', 'try', 'pass', 'Daisy', 'off', 'nurse.Barefoot', 'feel', 'good', 'film', 'glued', 'simply', 'Daisy', 'such', 'likeable', 'character', 'superbly', 'acted', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'very', 'childlike', 'innocence', 'eager', 'please', 'cares', 'so', 'much', 'contact', 'such', 'little', 'girl', 'dropping', 'flowers', 'care', 'about', 'events', 'proceed', 'sort', 'want', 'protect', 'are', 'huge', 'plot', 'holes', 'film', 'such', 'police', 'seeming', 'not', 'have', 'CB', 'radios', 'even', 'own', 'mobile', 'phones', 'radio', 'other', 'officers', 'care', 'so', 'much', 'Daisy', 'character', 'sort', 'let', 'slide', 'not', 'get', 'way', 'journey', 'Speedman', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'role', 'too.If', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'bit', 'more', 'successful', 'think', 'old', 'restored', 'campervan', 'RV', 'would', 'have', 'become', 'classic', 'movie', 'vehicle', 'as', 'well']",Barefoot Digital

1692723,A2Z3643FSM4PAQ,B00HW3EZZE,Joe Smart,"[22, 25]","Underwhelming English language remake of a hit German language romantic comedy.  A ne'er do well with gambling debts who works in a mental institution as part of his probation saves a beautiful and odd young woman who has recently been committed--in the German version it was from a suicide attempt but in this version it's from the attentions of a perv orderly.  In both versions she follows him out of the hospital without his knowledge and he ends up taking her to his brother's wedding where he plans to ask his wealthy dad for money to pay off those debts.The original movie allowed some time for the characters to get to know each other a little before he makes the decision to pass her off as his girlfriend in front of his family.  The American version doesn't seem to want to waste any time setting up the characters so it jumps almost immediately into the wedding subplot, which makes it seem all the more contrived and idiotic.Some critics have dismissed Barefoot as one of those the crazy people are saner than the rest of us movies but that's a complete misreading of the material.  Daisy isn't crazy--she's a (slightly) more real world version of the character Amy Adams played in Enchanted--a complete innocent encountering our world for the first time.  Evan Rachel wood is charming and sweet as Daisy and nearly saves the movie.  Unfortunately there are two very big problems.One is the male lead, Scott Speedman.  He's supposed to be playing a charming rogue but mostly comes across as an unlikable jerk.  Romantic comedies ultimately rise and fall on the chemistry of their leads but Evan Rachel Wood and Scott Speedman have no chemistry whatsoever, which makes it hard to root for them as a couple.  The other big problem is one of tone.  The original German Barefoot was an urban fairy tale that believed in the trans-formative power of love--by the end of the movie the lead characters end up saving each other through the power of the love each has for the other.  The English language version, on the other hand, is directed with a flat and literal tone that makes it feel more sitcom than fairy tale.  If you ever wondered what New Girl would be like if it starred Evan Rachel Wood instead of Zooey Deschanel Barefoot gives you a pretty good idea.If you can find it and don't mind subtitles I would highly recommend the original German language version of Barefoot.  This one not so much, but if you like romantic comedies a lot you will probably find this one cute enough to be more than watchable.",2,Track down the original instead,1393632000,"03 1, 2014",2014,2524,"['Underwhelming', 'English', 'language', 'remake', 'hit', 'German', 'language', 'romantic', 'comedy', ""ne'er"", 'do', 'well', 'gambling', 'debts', 'who', 'mental', 'institution', 'part', 'probation', 'beautiful', 'odd', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'recently', 'been', 'committed', 'German', 'version', 'was', 'suicide', 'attempt', 'version', 'attentions', 'perv', 'orderly', 'versions', 'hospital', 'knowledge', 'up', 'taking', 'brother', 'wedding', 'where', 'ask', 'wealthy', 'dad', 'money', 'pay', 'off', 'debts.The', 'original', 'movie', 'allowed', 'time', 'characters', 'get', 'know', 'other', 'little', 'decision', 'pass', 'off', 'girlfriend', 'front', 'family', 'American', 'version', ""n't"", 'seem', 'want', 'waste', 'time', 'setting', 'up', 'characters', 'almost', 'immediately', 'wedding', 'subplot', 'seem', 'more', 'contrived', 'idiotic.Some', 'critics', 'have', 'dismissed', 'Barefoot', 'one', 'crazy', 'people', 'are', 'saner', 'rest', 'movies', 'complete', 'misreading', 'material', 'Daisy', ""n't"", 'crazy', 'slightly', 'more', 'real', 'world', 'version', 'character', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'played', 'Enchanted', 'complete', 'innocent', 'encountering', 'world', 'first', 'time', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'wood', 'charming', 'sweet', 'Daisy', 'nearly', 'movie', 'Unfortunately', 'are', 'two', 'very', 'big', 'problems.One', 'male', 'lead', 'Scott', 'Speedman', 'supposed', 'be', 'playing', 'charming', 'rogue', 'mostly', 'across', 'unlikable', 'jerk', 'Romantic', 'comedies', 'ultimately', 'rise', 'fall', 'chemistry', 'leads', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'Scott', 'Speedman', 'have', 'chemistry', 'whatsoever', 'hard', 'root', 'couple', 'other', 'big', 'problem', 'one', 'tone', 'original', 'German', 'Barefoot', 'was', 'urban', 'fairy', 'tale', 'believed', 'trans-formative', 'power', 'love', 'end', 'movie', 'lead', 'characters', 'end', 'up', 'saving', 'other', 'power', 'love', 'other', 'English', 'language', 'version', 'other', 'hand', 'directed', 'flat', 'literal', 'tone', 'feel', 'more', 'sitcom', 'fairy', 'tale', 'ever', 'wondered', 'what', 'New', 'Girl', 'would', 'be', 'starred', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'instead', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'Barefoot', 'pretty', 'good', 'idea.If', 'can', 'find', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'subtitles', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'original', 'German', 'language', 'version', 'Barefoot', 'one', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'like', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'lot', 'will', 'probably', 'find', 'one', 'cute', 'enough', 'be', 'more', 'watchable']",Barefoot Digital
