The animation is almost as good as Toy Story (Main Frame that made Barbie Nutcracker are the guys that made that computer series Reboot) But the best animation has to be the Mouse King and Pimm. Tim Curry did an excellent role playing the regal rodent and I would say that little purple bat is the cutest charactor not to mention great comic relief to the story (it's so cute when Pimm whispers as the mouse king is holdng him upside down by his feet &quot;Sire I can't feel my toes&quot; and he gives them a little wiggle, Just makes you want to squeeze him!

I bought this for my daughter thinking that it would be fun video for her to watch (Barbie lover that she is at 2 1/2) as the holidays approach.  I didn't expect to fall in love with it myself.  In amazing computer animation, the Nutcracker is retold through the eyes of Barbie playing both the roles of Clara and the Sugarplum Princess.  The story is strong, with lots of action and tenderness:  the plotline includes, of course, Prince Eric as the Nutcracker, the Mouse King and his legions, and lots of adorable sugarplum fairies.  The dance sequences will take your breath away as the graphics artists have integrated actual footage of the dancing of the New York City Ballet into their computer animated scenes.  I only wish there had been more of them, but I will take quality over quantity!  A few of the scenes were a little rough for my 2-year old, but really no worse than a Disney movie.

I loved all the animated renditions of The Nutcracker, especially this one and The Nutcracker Prince (1991). The characters, music, and dancing! I loved it all!We all know this story was inspired by Peter Ilych Tchaikovsky (1840-93) from reading E.T.A. Hoffman's classic ""The Nutcracker and the Mouse King"", to write the music that has become so famous today. In this version, after some of the credits have been presented by a winter & spring fairy, we find Barbie and Kelly practicing the Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy for the ballet their holding. Sadly, Kelly gives up after she messes up a couple of times. To help her boost up her self-esteem and courage, Barbie tells her the story of the Nutcracker.In this version, Clara & her younger brother Tommy live with their grandfather Drosseilmier, after their parents have died. Drossilmier is very stern with the children, and doesn't believe in girls having dreams or traveling around the world. He believes that a girl should be responsible and pratical. (Yeah, right!) On Christmas Eve, Clara's aunt Drossilmier (Nice! For once, a girl magician makes the story come to life!) comes to join in on the celebration. She gives Tommy a High Grandier and a Burzian General for his army, and Clara, a very unique nutcracker. She comes to love it, but Tommy accidently breaks the nutcrackers arm. She then tends it and comes to care for him, even though he has a hideous face. That night, after a brief discussion with grandfather and aunt Drossilmier, the clock strikes 12:00, and everything comes to life! An army of mice, lead by the vicious Mouse King (Tim Curry, The Pebble and the Penguin, Ferngully: The Last Rainforest, Home Alone 2: Lost in New York) appear in the parlor, and the Nutcracker comes to life! The nutcracker nearly loses his life if Clara hadn't saved him. She does this by throwing her shoe to the Mouse King's head, which defeats him... for a little while. Then, the nutcracker asks Clara to come with him to find the Sugar Plum Princess, so that that she can help him. At first, Clara backs out, but then, decides to join in. As an owl tells her, when she reaches her destination and needs to go home, open the locket he gave her, and she will return home.As the story goes on, we learn that the entire fairy tale kingdom is under the Mouse King's doom, after he destroys the Prince, Eric. Everyone hates him because he didn't do much of anything for the people. Who is this Prince Eric? What really happened to him? Can Clara & Nutcracker defeat the Mouse King? And will they ever find the Sugar Plum Princess?This contains all of the music from the original ballet as well as stupendous dancing choreographed by the New York City Ballet, it's no wonder everyone goes to see this show every holiday season. Why do people have to be specific and so true to the original form of the story? So what if it's not perfect? That's what makes it fun! A new version enlightens and strengthens a child's (and adult's) imagination each time you see one. That's the beauty of a story!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Buy the DVD today!

I was pleasantly surprised the movie has a decent and very human story. That, in combination with traditional nutcracker music and dance sequences made this an enjoyable movie.The animation is slightly inferior to some other recent animations (e.g. Shrek). Some people look kinda wooden. Despite this, it is good enough to capture the beauty of ballet dancing.In the bonus section there is an inspiration video about several young ballet students. Too bad there is no &quot;making of&quot;. It would be very interesting to see how they do the motion capture of the dance sequences and to actually see some of the human dancers.

It is very enjoyable from start to finish and will captivate any age or sex if he/she will just sit down, relax and watch it. A great family movie for the holidays. My daughter is only three and she rarely sits still to watch a movie; however, with Barbie as the main character, along with the lovely fairies dancing and singing, the beautiful pink horse Marzipan, and yes, even the evil bat and Mouse King [Tim Curry's translation/voice is awesome,] she actually lies down and watches it ALL!WHAT I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THE MOST IS THE HEART IN THIS MOVIE. It is very strong, especially displayed by Barbie and the Nutcracker. I am completely impressed with both of them. They are wonderful role models for our children. You will see the &quot;heart&quot; and you will feel the goodness, through them. It is truly magical. Barbie represents in the kind of young lady we, as parents, want our daughters to grow up as--kind, soft-spoken, sincere, intelligent, and strong. This movie isn't just for girls, brothers will surely enjoy it as well and hopefully observe the Nutcracker's strength, demeanor and chivalry and learn a few things as well.BARBIE IN THE NUTCRACKER IS THE SPECIAL, RARE KIND OF MOVIE THAT REMINDS ME WE LIVE IN A TRULY MAGICAL WORLD WHERE ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE.
