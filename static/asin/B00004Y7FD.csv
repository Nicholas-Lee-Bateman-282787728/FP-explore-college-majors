Zenon is a 13 year old girl who lives on a space space station in the future. When she discovers that the owner of the space station has planted a virus to destroy it, she tries to expose him for the slime that he is. But when her plan backfires, her parents ground her to earth where she has to adapt to a whole new lifestyle and find a way to get back to space to save her family and friends. This movie has really good music, too. I was surprised that Disney never released a soundtrack, although a few songs were featured on the disney cd, &quot;Hears Premiers&quot;.

(I was exposed to it by a friend's young daughter who watched this non-stop as a kid.)If you're a kid, you're going to love this. It's cute, it's fun, and best of all the main character is someone that many girls will be able to relate to. You probably won't be able to keep the attention of the very young kids (under 5), but any kid over that age will undoubtedly love this.If you're an adult, you'll probably feel like you'd rather watch paint dry. Give the movie a chance since it's pretty cute for a children's movie and best of all, it's squeaky clean as far as content goes. No real violence, no innuendo- there's nothing here that you'd be likely to find objectionable.The only downfall is that this is only available on VHS unless you can find a bootleg DVD or YouTube copy. You'll probably have to dig out the old VCR if you want to watch this, but it's worth it if you want to take a trip down memory lane or watch a futuristic kid's flick.",4,"Stupid, but you can't help but like it",1330732800,"03 3, 2012",2012,1105,"['ended', 'up', 're-watching', 'tonight', 'accident', 'was', 'work', 'was', 'lobby', 'TV', 'have', 'say', 'still', 'pretty', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'was', 'exposed', 'friend', 'young', 'daughter', 'who', 'watched', 'non-stop', 'kid', ""'re"", 'kid', ""'re"", 'going', 'love', 'cute', 'fun', 'best', 'main', 'character', 'someone', 'many', 'girls', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'relate', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'keep', 'attention', 'very', 'young', 'kids', '5', 'kid', 'age', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'love', 'this.If', ""'re"", 'adult', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'feel', ""'d"", 'rather', 'watch', 'paint', 'dry', 'Give', 'movie', 'chance', 'pretty', 'cute', 'children', 'movie', 'best', 'squeaky', 'clean', 'as', 'far', 'content', 'real', 'violence', 'innuendo-', 'nothing', 'here', ""'d"", 'be', 'likely', 'find', 'objectionable.The', 'only', 'downfall', 'only', 'available', 'VHS', 'can', 'find', 'bootleg', 'DVD', 'YouTube', 'copy', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'have', 'dig', 'out', 'old', 'VCR', 'want', 'watch', 'want', 'take', 'trip', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'watch', 'futuristic', 'kid', 'flick']",Zenon:Girl of the 21st Century VHS

The movie is set in the distant future where everyone drives VW Bugs, Chelsea Clinton is president, kids like to hack into computers and play bizarre games with spinning milk cartons. Not only is the movie's layout a quirky, creative factory of fun, but it's characters are very appealing...and I'm not talking about Zenon in particular! There is Margie, the notorious anti-hero who is overly protective of her beloved Greg. Greg is a subdued sexual maniac who's always making subtle advances on Zenon whether they're miscalculated pick-up lines or head bobs.

However, it was wonderful and I may have enjoyed it more, or at least as much as, my daughters.  I have to admit that I have yet to find a Disney movie that I don't like, so I should have known they could create a great movie, even with a topic I didn't care for.When Zenon gets sent to Earth to stay with her aunt, and stay out of trouble... well, as her first trip since she was a very young girl, it was very very funny to watch her fascination with the &quot;manual&quot; style of life.  Watching Zenon adjust to Earth life is quite funny.  Just her reaction to rain is an excellent scene.In addition to adjusting to this life, she is determined to solve another mystery... the cause of her animosity toward the owner of the space ship her friends and family are living on... the space ship that suddenly begins to lose power and suffer serious and possibly fatal consequences.  Can Zenon save the little space city, or will she end up an orphan?  How can a young girl who routinely gets in trouble, and is known for her wild imagination, convince her parents of the root of this problem?  You'll have to watch to find out... but I wouldn't miss this one!  In addition to all of these problems, Zenon is developing some wonderful friendships, and testing their loyalty and human nature in order to save the space city.  One other memorable character is Margie, the young girl who hates Zenon and wants nothing more than for her to return to the space city.  If nothing else, she will keep you in stitches... and you just know from the first sight of her, and her reaction to Zenon, that this girl will keep you entertained.",5,Fun!

I don't mind watching them once in a while, but they're not the best thing to waste your time doing. Anyway, I had read the little childrens book to my sister a couple years ago, so I decided I'd watch it when I heard Disney was going to make it. The book was about trouble maker Zenon who lives on a space station in the future being sent to earth to stay with her grand parents. She found it booring until her dog had puppies. I thought the book was so stupid. But Disney wrote a completely different story for the movie. In the movie, Zenon is in 7th grade, not 5th grade like in the book. When she is accidentially in the wrong place at the right time, she witnesses someone loading a virus into her space station that she lives on. When no one believes her, her parents ground her to earth, which is considered a very dangerous place to live because of pollution and earthquakes and such. She has a little trouble fitting in, but she ends up falling in love and discovers everyone in the space station is about to die because of the virus. Now she dosen't have much time to get back into space and save the day. I reccomend if you haven't seen it, that you go to your local video store and rent it, or maybe wait and see if the price drops. I guarantee you'll like it.
