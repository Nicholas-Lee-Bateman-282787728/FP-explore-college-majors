It can't be really being made for TV. The acting is ok, not stellar, but it won't put you to sleep watching it. The story goes over more than that covered in The Ten Commandments though, and that is something that it has going for it.Overall it's a good compliment to the de Mille classic and one I recommend watching for what happens after the Hebrews receive the Ten Commandments.",3,Moses,1232582400,"01 22, 2009",2009,619,"['shortened', 'version', '1970', 'TV', 'mini', 'series', 'dealing', 'story', 'Moses', 'exodus', 'Hebrews', 'reign', 'Egyptian', 'pharaoh.This', 'movie', 'not', 'close', 'epic', '1950', 'classic', 'Ten', 'Commandments', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'really', 'being', 'made', 'TV', 'acting', 'ok', 'not', 'stellar', 'wo', ""n't"", 'put', 'sleep', 'watching', 'story', 'more', 'covered', 'Ten', 'Commandments', 'something', 'going', 'it.Overall', 'good', 'compliment', 'de', 'Mille', 'classic', 'one', 'recommend', 'watching', 'what', 'Hebrews', 'receive', 'Ten', 'Commandments']",N/A

The antithesis of the Cecile B DeMille's over-the-top (but enjoyable) version.This is a very understated, and therefore entirely realistic version of how it could have happened.The edited version is acceptable, but I recall that the full version really conveyed a sense of the epic journey, which this compressed version, simply does not.Hopefully the studios will give it a good digital clean up and release the full version in the near future.Furthermore, the musical score is one of Ennio Morricone's best....not to be missed!",3,Studio....please release the complete mini-series!,1244678400,"06 11, 2009",2009,579,"['beautiful', 'telling', 'Moses', 'storey', 'antithesis', 'Cecile', 'B', 'DeMille', 'over-the-top', 'enjoyable', 'version.This', 'very', 'understated', 'therefore', 'entirely', 'realistic', 'version', 'how', 'could', 'have', 'happened.The', 'edited', 'version', 'acceptable', 'recall', 'full', 'version', 'really', 'conveyed', 'sense', 'epic', 'journey', 'compressed', 'version', 'simply', 'not.Hopefully', 'studios', 'will', 'give', 'good', 'digital', 'clean', 'release', 'full', 'version', 'near', 'future.Furthermore', 'musical', 'score', 'one', 'Ennio', 'Morricone', 'best', '.not', 'be', 'missed']",N/A

837127,A188KU3SI543V3,B0002J58JM,"rnorton828 ""rnorton828""","[24, 28]","I remember watching this program during the mid-1970's, when it was broadcast under the title ""Moses: The Lawgiver,"" produced by Vincenzo Labella, who would later produce Franco Zeffirelli's miniseries ""Jesus of Nazareth.""  What we have on this DVD is a portion of that miniseries edited down from 6 hours to 141 minutes.  Why?  This would have made a great 2-DVD set with the complete, uncut miniseries, just as the ""Jesus of Nazareth"" DVD set was.  What you do get to see here is a great performance by Burt Lancaster as Moses.  Anthony Quale also shines as Moses' brother Aaron.  This program follows Moses from his birth and upbringing in the Egyptian court to his exile in Midian where he meets his wife Zipporah (Irene Papas).  Then after he is called by God at the burning bush, Moses returns to Egypt to demand the release of his people.  We then witness the ten plagues, the Exodus (although the parting of the Red Sea doesn't quite look as ""majestic"" as the effect in ""The Ten Commandments""), and the Ten Commandments and the Golden Calf.  If this had been the complete miniseries, I would have been willing to give 5 stars.
