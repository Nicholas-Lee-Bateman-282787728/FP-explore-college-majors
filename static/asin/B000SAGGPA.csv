1085806,A1GQ7AFCN7OZMK,B000SAGGPA,amster,"[4, 10]","""The Case for Christ"" presents itself as a rational and objective examination of the validity of Christianity, but it's really just thinly veiled propaganda, and therefore is very deceptive and misleading.  It relies almost exclusively on logical fallacies and circular arguments to make its case.  Example: the resurrection of Jesus was supposedly witnessed by over 300 people because the Bible claims that 300 people witnessed it.  Sorry, but no.  To merely claim that 300 people witnessed it is not reliable evidence by any stretch of the imagination.  For such a claim to have any sort of validity, you would need to have 300 independent testimonies.  At another point in the film, they talk about Oral Tradition and make the claim that the similarities between the four Gospels are proof that they are reliable accounts, and then directly contradict themselves by claiming that the discrepancies between the Gospels also prove the same thing.  They also make the claim that the Gospels are reliable because the story of Jesus fulfills many of the prophecies contained in older writings, but is it not possible that the writers of the Gospels were familiar with these older texts and merely shaped their accounts to fulfill them?  The only ""expert"" witnesses that the film offers are those clearly on the side of Christianity.  If you want to present your film as objective research, then you have to give the other side a fair shake.  How about testimony from a biologist on whether or not it is possible for dead flesh to become reanimated, for example?  Is it medically possible for a woman to become impregnated ""magically (i.e.: without her egg being fertilized by sperm)""?  The only time given to the other side is in the form of lazy straw-man arguments that are quickly dismissed.  An argument that pops up quite frequently is ""No one would make up such a story because no one would believe it, therefore it must be true.""  I would ask if the makers of theis film were at all familiar with the propaganda technique called THE BIG LIE: the bigger the lie, the more likely people will believe it because they'll refuse to believe that anyone would be so audacious as to make up such a claim.  I don't even have a college degree, and yet I'm confident that I could wipe the floor with any of their so-called experts in a fair and open debate.  The author makes the claim at the end of the film that it takes more faith to be an atheist than it does to be a believer, which is ludicrous.  It doesn't take any amount of faith to believe in a world based on physics, mathematics, and natural law, a world based on consistent, observable phenomena (2+2 ALWAYS equals 4, and an apple that becomes detached from a tree will ALWAYS be pulled to the earth by gravity at the same exact speed, and the dead stay dead).  On the other hand, belief in a world with no consistent laws, where things just magically ""happen"", and the rules can be changed on the whim of a capricious deity is a belief that relies EXCLUSIVELY on faith.",1,"Thinly Veiled Propaganda Claiming to be ""Objective""",1326585600,"01 15, 2012",2012,3027,"['Case', 'Christ', 'rational', 'objective', 'examination', 'validity', 'Christianity', 'really', 'just', 'thinly', 'veiled', 'propaganda', 'therefore', 'very', 'deceptive', 'misleading', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'logical', 'fallacies', 'circular', 'arguments', 'make', 'case', 'Example', 'resurrection', 'Jesus', 'was', 'supposedly', 'witnessed', '300', 'people', 'Bible', '300', 'people', 'witnessed', 'Sorry', 'merely', 'claim', '300', 'people', 'witnessed', 'not', 'reliable', 'evidence', 'stretch', 'imagination', 'such', 'claim', 'have', 'sort', 'validity', 'would', 'need', 'have', '300', 'independent', 'testimonies', 'point', 'film', 'talk', 'Oral', 'Tradition', 'make', 'claim', 'similarities', 'four', 'Gospels', 'are', 'proof', 'are', 'reliable', 'accounts', 'then', 'directly', 'contradict', 'claiming', 'discrepancies', 'Gospels', 'also', 'prove', 'same', 'thing', 'also', 'make', 'claim', 'Gospels', 'are', 'reliable', 'story', 'Jesus', 'many', 'prophecies', 'contained', 'older', 'writings', 'not', 'possible', 'writers', 'Gospels', 'were', 'familiar', 'older', 'texts', 'merely', 'shaped', 'accounts', 'fulfill', 'only', 'expert', 'witnesses', 'film', 'offers', 'are', 'clearly', 'side', 'Christianity', 'want', 'present', 'film', 'objective', 'research', 'then', 'have', 'give', 'other', 'side', 'fair', 'shake', 'How', 'testimony', 'biologist', 'not', 'possible', 'dead', 'flesh', 'become', 'reanimated', 'example', 'medically', 'possible', 'woman', 'become', 'impregnated', 'magically', 'i.e', 'egg', 'being', 'fertilized', 'sperm', 'only', 'time', 'given', 'other', 'side', 'form', 'lazy', 'straw-man', 'arguments', 'are', 'quickly', 'dismissed', 'argument', 'up', 'quite', 'frequently', 'No', 'one', 'would', 'make', 'up', 'such', 'story', 'one', 'would', 'believe', 'must', 'be', 'true', 'would', 'ask', 'makers', 'theis', 'film', 'were', 'familiar', 'propaganda', 'technique', 'called', 'THE', 'BIG', 'LIE', 'bigger', 'lie', 'more', 'likely', 'people', 'will', 'believe', ""'ll"", 'refuse', 'believe', 'anyone', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'audacious', 'make', 'up', 'such', 'claim', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'college', 'degree', 'yet', ""'m"", 'confident', 'could', 'wipe', 'floor', 'so-called', 'experts', 'fair', 'open', 'debate', 'author', 'claim', 'end', 'film', 'more', 'faith', 'be', 'atheist', 'be', 'believer', 'ludicrous', ""n't"", 'take', 'amount', 'faith', 'believe', 'world', 'based', 'physics', 'mathematics', 'natural', 'law', 'world', 'based', 'consistent', 'observable', 'phenomena', '2+2', 'ALWAYS', 'equals', '4', 'apple', 'detached', 'tree', 'will', 'ALWAYS', 'be', 'pulled', 'earth', 'gravity', 'same', 'exact', 'speed', 'dead', 'stay', 'dead', 'other', 'hand', 'belief', 'world', 'consistent', 'laws', 'where', 'things', 'just', 'magically', 'happen', 'rules', 'can', 'be', 'changed', 'whim', 'capricious', 'deity', 'belief', 'EXCLUSIVELY', 'faith']",N/A

As I was watching it, I didn't find the first half all that convincing. If you pay attention though (the documentary is a chronological rendition of Mr. Strobel's research into Christ), you will see that when Mr. Strobel was at the same point in his research, he wasn't convinced either.

If not watch it!!! * I'm an absolute believer in GOD!!However, Lee, dropped the ball on this one! Everything verified here was mostly substantiated by the bible itself (99%). I'm sorry I'm not convinced!!!A man (GOD's Son) that travels with multitudes of people, disciples, performs miracles, rose from the dead [yet] amazingly is not found in any documentation other than the bible. WOW!!! Yes, you may find a weak statement or two, regarding a Christ and or Savior yet you have to try really hard to accept that Jesus himself was whom they were referring to!!If others find what I'm about to say offensive... I apologize!! I hear what you're preaching so why not hear my thoughts and belief's?I myself (as Lee has done) am personally searching for truth... there are many things I have found to be overwhelming constants and not so easily cleansed of its so called misinterpretation by religion!![EXAMPLE] There are lists of Jesus attributes ~VERBATIM~ to that of many mythological characters adding to Joesph in the Old Testament.How long was the Egyptian and or the Roman Empire? Why? All believed in something other than what we believe today!!! So why when all their god's and deity's are dismissed as myth are the ones found in the Bible still so absolute?** The Roman Empire along with ""Men Of Faith"" made our current Bible (300 AD). This story of Jesus is MANipulated and tainted - I'm not buying into it anymore!!!FYI:God is not a man nor anything closely resembling that which we call Human. God is ""Absolute Energy""... found in everything (a rock, a germ, a cell, an atom, mountains, planets, the sun, sky, space, etc...).GOD is 100% guarenteed in every sub-atomic particle of my being!!! So who are we that we should be given GODS ONLY SON? Doesn't that sound a bit vain to you? It's as obscure as money, racism, government, institutions and or any factions we divide ourselves into.So why do we need a savior when we are a part of the whole!?!CONTROL...

1085811,A33Z8L75OXCP78,B000SAGGPA,Eric Schenk,"[1, 9]","I'm always curious about any ""evidence-based case"" ""establishing"" that there is a god who sporadically intervenes in history; stopped the sun in the sky; and favors some professional football teams over others.  As other reviewers have noted, this dvd is more the story of Lee Strobel's conversion rather than a fair-minded argument that Jesus was/is the Messiah of Jewish theology as well as the only son of the god of the Jewish bible.  In fact, Lee Strobel does such a poor job of presenting a legitimate case for his conclusions that one wonders how he holds a position with the Chicago Tribune.To begin with, he suggests that he has based his case in large part on evidence presented by ""experts.""  However, every single one of his experts is from institutions such as Jerry Falwell's Liberty College, that are dedicated to fundamentalist principles.  None of the great number of experts who disagree with his contentions are present.  Secondly, he presents as fact items that are almost certainly false.  For example, he quotes from the first century Jewish historian, Josephus, as evidence of Jesus's existence.  But Strobel conveniently neglects to mention that not a single Christian referenced this singular mention of Jesus outside of the Gospels for three hundred years until Eusebius mentions it sometime in the fourth century.  Many argue that this does not establish that the passages mentioning Jesus were later insertions into the text.  But any fair-minded presentation would have to at least reference the problems with asserting that Josephus mentioned Jesus.In attempting to dismiss the discrepancies between the various Gospels, Strobel states that the fact that the Gospels diverge on various facts establishes that they are legitimate since had they agreed down the line, it would have shown collusion.  This might be the case if the discrepancies were only over minor points.  But they diverge on major issues.  Why don't all the Gospels mention the virgin birth.  This would seem to be crucial to establishing Jesus's bona fides.  Matthew states that Jesus was born when Herod was king while Luke states that Cyrenius was governor of Syria at the time of Jesus's birth, but Herod was dead before Cyrenius became governor. And if, as Strobel maintains, two of the gospels were written by two of the 12 disciples, how could they have been written in Greek since Jesus and his disciples spoke Aramaic and it is unlikely that more than one of the apostles could write Greek.Then in discussing the resurrection, Strobel's experts state that Paul wrote that Jesus appeared to him in the flesh.  But it is, at best, arguable that Paul is making this contention. The better reading is that Paul is describing a vision of Christ.  These are just a few of the major defects in Strobel's presentation. In short, while Strobel claims that he sought to present nothing but the truth, it is clear that he made no real attempt to do so.  Strobel comes across as a good man and if becoming a Christian made him a better person, that is wonderful.  But one would not want Strobel representing him in a court of law because he does not appear able to make a fair presentation. And if the ""case"" he presents is the best case to establish his beliefs in Jesus as the Jewish Messiah and the one and only son of god, then it is clear that there is no compelling evidentiary basis for the Christian religion.I am always impressed by those such as Dorothy Day or even Tim Tebow who are inspired by their faith in Jesus to follow Jesus's example of charity, warmth, and loving kindness.  To the extent that Christianity has spawned such people, I consider it a wonderful gift to humanity.  But I feel that way about whatever beliefs or attitudes prompt people to live such lives.  Strobel does not make the case that Christianity is the one true faith or that there is even an entity that corresponds to the god present in the Bible.  More importantly, his attempt to do so may be sincere, but it is not honest.  The best adjective to describe this dvd is sophomoric.",2,The fix was in.,1264464000,"01 26, 2010",2010,4068,"[""'m"", 'always', 'curious', 'evidence-based', 'case', 'establishing', 'god', 'who', 'sporadically', 'intervenes', 'history', 'stopped', 'sun', 'sky', 'favors', 'professional', 'football', 'teams', 'others', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'dvd', 'more', 'story', 'Lee', 'Strobel', 'conversion', 'rather', 'fair-minded', 'argument', 'Jesus', 'was/is', 'Messiah', 'Jewish', 'theology', 'as', 'well', 'only', 'son', 'god', 'Jewish', 'bible', 'fact', 'Lee', 'Strobel', 'poor', 'job', 'presenting', 'legitimate', 'case', 'conclusions', 'one', 'how', 'position', 'Chicago', 'Tribune.To', 'begin', 'based', 'case', 'large', 'part', 'evidence', 'presented', 'experts', 'However', 'single', 'one', 'experts', 'institutions', 'such', 'Jerry', 'Falwell', 'Liberty', 'College', 'are', 'dedicated', 'fundamentalist', 'principles', 'None', 'great', 'number', 'experts', 'who', 'disagree', 'contentions', 'are', 'present', 'Secondly', 'fact', 'items', 'are', 'almost', 'certainly', 'false', 'example', 'first', 'century', 'Jewish', 'historian', 'Josephus', 'evidence', 'Jesus', 'existence', 'Strobel', 'conveniently', 'mention', 'not', 'single', 'Christian', 'referenced', 'singular', 'mention', 'Jesus', 'Gospels', 'three', 'hundred', 'years', 'Eusebius', 'mentions', 'sometime', 'fourth', 'century', 'Many', 'argue', 'not', 'establish', 'passages', 'mentioning', 'Jesus', 'were', 'later', 'insertions', 'text', 'fair-minded', 'presentation', 'would', 'have', 'least', 'reference', 'problems', 'asserting', 'Josephus', 'mentioned', 'Jesus.In', 'attempting', 'dismiss', 'discrepancies', 'various', 'Gospels', 'Strobel', 'fact', 'Gospels', 'diverge', 'various', 'facts', 'establishes', 'are', 'legitimate', 'had', 'agreed', 'line', 'would', 'have', 'shown', 'collusion', 'might', 'be', 'case', 'discrepancies', 'were', 'only', 'minor', 'points', 'diverge', 'major', 'issues', 'Why', 'do', ""n't"", 'all', 'Gospels', 'mention', 'virgin', 'birth', 'would', 'seem', 'be', 'crucial', 'establishing', 'Jesus', 'bona', 'fides', 'Matthew', 'Jesus', 'was', 'born', 'when', 'Herod', 'was', 'king', 'Luke', 'states', 'Cyrenius', 'was', 'governor', 'Syria', 'time', 'Jesus', 'birth', 'Herod', 'was', 'dead', 'Cyrenius', 'became', 'governor', 'Strobel', 'two', 'gospels', 'were', 'written', 'two', '12', 'disciples', 'how', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'Greek', 'Jesus', 'disciples', 'spoke', 'Aramaic', 'unlikely', 'more', 'one', 'apostles', 'could', 'write', 'Greek.Then', 'discussing', 'resurrection', 'Strobel', 'experts', 'state', 'Paul', 'wrote', 'Jesus', 'appeared', 'flesh', 'best', 'arguable', 'Paul', 'making', 'contention', 'better', 'reading', 'Paul', 'describing', 'vision', 'Christ', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'major', 'defects', 'Strobel', 'presentation', 'short', 'Strobel', 'sought', 'present', 'nothing', 'truth', 'clear', 'made', 'real', 'attempt', 'do', 'so', 'Strobel', 'across', 'good', 'man', 'becoming', 'Christian', 'made', 'better', 'person', 'wonderful', 'one', 'would', 'not', 'want', 'Strobel', 'representing', 'court', 'law', 'not', 'appear', 'able', 'make', 'fair', 'presentation', 'case', 'best', 'case', 'establish', 'beliefs', 'Jesus', 'Jewish', 'Messiah', 'one', 'only', 'son', 'god', 'then', 'clear', 'compelling', 'evidentiary', 'basis', 'Christian', 'religion.I', 'am', 'always', 'impressed', 'such', 'Dorothy', 'Day', 'even', 'Tim', 'Tebow', 'who', 'are', 'inspired', 'faith', 'Jesus', 'follow', 'Jesus', 'example', 'charity', 'warmth', 'loving', 'kindness', 'extent', 'Christianity', 'spawned', 'such', 'people', 'consider', 'wonderful', 'gift', 'humanity', 'feel', 'way', 'beliefs', 'attitudes', 'prompt', 'people', 'live', 'such', 'lives', 'Strobel', 'not', 'make', 'case', 'Christianity', 'one', 'true', 'faith', 'even', 'entity', 'god', 'present', 'Bible', 'More', 'importantly', 'attempt', 'do', 'so', 'may', 'be', 'sincere', 'not', 'honest', 'best', 'adjective', 'describe', 'dvd', 'sophomoric']",N/A

1085816,A2QIOTWDGR47HC,B000SAGGPA,John Smith,"[3, 5]","The video is fine--ok. But not fantastic. I just finished watching it and thought I'd add a review. I got it for free with another purchase (not from Amazon).I like KH's comments, ""Quality Technical Presentation, but Lacks Depth"". S/He summed up much of what i thought. He gave the video a 3.  Take a look at his comments if you are considering buying the video.The video does lack depth. So a lot of people ""looking for answers"" will not be satisfied. I've not read the book, but possibly the book will include more information. In fact that is what another #3 rating wrote, Mr D to be exact in ""A brief visual preview of the book."" Mr D state that there is 'a lot more in the book.' I've not bought it so I can't comment at the moment.I'm pointing out these posts just to help you identify some of the more truthful ones. Not that the others are lies but it helps to confirm a few things.Sometimes, you don't know what to think of the ONE STAR REVIEWS. Some are just outright malicious. Many times they don't even read the books are watch the video they just ATTACK! At least the ones I've read so far seem about right. They don't seem to be unwarranted attacks against the video.1) If you are a non-Christian or a strong skeptic, do not buy this video, it will likely be a waste of money. (I didn't buy the video, i got it for free myself.)2) If you are a Christian looking for SMALL TID BITS OF INFORMATION you may find a few things to strengthen your faith.  The video is very fast moving and even i had to stop it a few times to replay it to really get the sense of some of what they were saying.3) IF YOU HAVE READ THE BOOK, you will likely get the most out of the video since I would assume it would be a quick REVIEW  as stated above of the material. The video may have some value for you to help you remember, to show to others and then have discussions later. I can't say for sure, but this is the way a lot of videos based on deep subjects are. They simply can't cover the detail that a book can. I like videos based on books because of the quick review and the visualizations.Now here are my personal views. I feel the video could have provided some extras at least, maybe quote from Christ fathers that backed up what they were saying about persecution, doubts about Jesus' resurrection etc.  Instead of simply naming names, they could have provided the references so people can a least look up the full quotes later. The extras could have been a bit more in depth. There could have been a question and answer section or something. A list of suggested reading materials would have BEEN EXCELLENT given the purpose. That would have made the video a lot richer.They make a lot of statements in the video that they simply want you to ACCEPT BECAUSE I SAID IT. The biggest proofs are focused on the Resurrection which was really good i thought. The rest of the video seemed a bit rubbish.People who already believe in the Bible will need much more study to really appreciate some of the points presented in the video. As one person stated when giving the video ONE STAR, 'Most of its proof comes from the Bible itself about 99%.' Well, one has to appreciate that the bible is not just one book. It is two collections or libraries of books--The Hebrew Scriptures and the Christian Greek Scriptures. It is very important to note that Jesus was rejected by the guardians of the Hebrew Scriptures, so there was no collaboration there. This creates a dynamic for asking certain types of questions due to obvious opposition. I can't go into all the details, but my point is that this ONE DETAIL IF MISSED can cause a person to REALLY MISS a lot of points regarding proof of Jesus as the promised Messiah. The bible is not one book. It is 2 collections of two different traditions--one rejected by the other. The first question i ask is ""Why were the prophecies made in the first placed (in the Hebrew Scriptures)?"", ""Who would dare try to fulfill them?"", ""What are the chances that we would have a seemingly glaring fulfillment (hundreds or thousands of years later) in a person that appears at the RIGHT TIME in history?""These questions may not be obvious to a typical Christian thinker but they are very important to begin to understand the depths of the issues of apologetics. Without this understanding, a lot of stuff will go completely over your heads and will likely frustrate you--""how adn why is this proof... This is proof of nothing... I'm tired of this %^$%$^$##!""This video is for babies just starting to understand the basics of apologetics. it is not for anyone with an in depth knowledge of either side of the issue.  Even for babes, I think that it could have given them a firmer grasp on at least WHY QUOTE THE OLD TESTAMENT?  I think just a little more work and fore thought could have made it a good research for the First Timer! So i think it lacks even that.  Possibly i should give it 2 STARS but certianly no where near 4. I just can't see it unless you are a FIRST TIMER and this is all so new to you.Best wishes. I dont' mean to insult anyone. I'm just trying to provide objective information i think will be helpful to those seeking answers and trying to sort out who to believe, what to expect and should they buy. This video is the type that draws people in crisis and that would be a mistake for many. (If i had bought it, i would have been disappointed. Get it used for $5 with shipping included or get it from the library.)",3,This video is not really for SKEPTICS and NON-Christians!,1267142400,"02 26, 2010",2010,5459,"['video', 'fine', 'ok', 'not',

This one was no exception (although it was better than I expected it to be). For me, even the Synoptic Gospels never sufficiently answered my questions about Jesus. It was more like reading excerpts from an unfinished story that inevitably triggered additional questions the answers to which were not to be found anywhere in the Bible. All of my questions about Jesus (along with other philosophically challenging questions about God and the universe we live in) were finally answered when I was fortunate enough many years ago to come across a copy of The Urantia Book (aka The Urantia Papers). As the most recent epochal revelation of divine truth bestowed upon our planet (but don't take my word for that...read it and judge for yourself before making a determination about what it is or is not), 77 of its 196 Papers are devoted exclusively to The Life and Teachings of Jesus. I recall being repeatedly scolded by more than one nun in my youth when I would ask things such as: Why do the Gospels jump from Jesus as a kid in the Temple around age 12 or so to Jesus as a full grown adult in his mid-30s? What happened to Jesus during those intervening years? In response to these and other thought-provoking questions I persistently asked, I was often told God did not want me to know those things. They wanted me to just shut up and smile and be blissfully content on the outside whilst on the inside I choked upon their fossilized versions of tainted truth without rebelliously questioning either the actual source of their dead-dogma doctrines or their primitive Gestapo-methods of using fear and intimidation and even occasionally physical violence to exert their Nazi-like mind-control over those of us who were unfortunate enough to have become their intellectual prisoners.

It is propaganda, and an assault on intellectual honesty, the pocketbooks of the credulous, and any worthwhile regard for the truth.While I happen to believe that an honest case can be built for Jesus and his teachings, this video is a supreme example of how to NOT do so.  This video was simply too embarrassing to be allowed to go unchallenged.

I was extremely impressed with both the content and the production values. The video is a great introduction to Christian apologetics both for the ordinary ""man or woman in the pew"" and the ""ordinary skeptic.""To claims that the film is biased, of course it is. It's an apologetic documentary after all. But it is nevertheless a fairly balanced overview, or summary, of the evidence for the truth claims of the NT. This documentary isn't any more biased than the TV documentaries that usually air on the cable channels (A&E;, THC, DSV, TLC, etc.) at Christmas and Easter which are typically aimed at a popular audience and biased against the truth claims of the NT and which usually cater to the sensational and bizarre. Strobel's DVD should serve as a nice counterpoint to all the popular sensationalist documentaries out there. True, the film doesn't get too technical, however perhaps it really doesn't need to? Anyone interested in delving deeper can check out the books listed in the bibliography, many of them written by the very scholars interviewed in the film.Also interesting are the special features video interviews with many of the scholars interviewed in the film giving personal testimonials about how their work as scholars has increased their faith.I think every church would benefit by screening this DVD for its members.",5,A  Great Introduction to Christian Apologetics,1205625600,"03 16, 2008",2008,1431,"['Lee', 'Strobel', 'done', 'Christian', 'community-and', 'indeed', 'world', 'service', 'DVD', 'was', 'extremely', 'impressed', 'content', 'production', 'values', 'video', 'great', 'introduction', 'Christian', 'apologetics', 'ordinary', 'man', 'woman', 'pew', 'ordinary', 'skeptic', 'claims', 'film', 'biased', 'course', 'apologetic', 'documentary', 'nevertheless', 'fairly', 'balanced', 'overview', 'summary', 'evidence', 'truth', 'claims', 'NT', 'documentary', ""n't"", 'more', 'biased', 'TV', 'documentaries', 'usually', 'air', 'cable', 'channels', 'A', 'E', 'THC', 'DSV', 'TLC', 'etc', 'Christmas', 'Easter', 'are', 'typically', 'aimed', 'popular', 'audience', 'biased', 'truth', 'claims', 'NT', 'usually', 'cater', 'sensational', 'bizarre', 'Strobel', 'DVD', 'should', 'serve', 'nice', 'counterpoint', 'popular', 'sensationalist', 'documentaries', 'out', 'there', 'True', 'film', ""n't"", 'get', 'too', 'technical', 'however', 'perhaps', 'really', ""n't"", 'need', 'Anyone', 'interested', 'delving', 'deeper', 'can', 'check', 'out', 'books', 'listed', 'bibliography', 'many', 'written', 'very', 'scholars', 'interviewed', 'film.Also', 'interesting', 'are', 'special', 'features', 'video', 'interviews', 'many', 'scholars', 'interviewed', 'film', 'giving', 'personal', 'testimonials', 'how', 'work', 'scholars', 'increased', 'faith.I', 'think', 'church', 'would', 'benefit', 'screening', 'DVD', 'members']",N/A

Peek,"[1, 1]","This DVD is great introduction for those looking into this most important topic - the question of whether Jesus Christ is God in the flesh and why that is important.In this brief video, former atheist and investigative reporter Lee Strobel reviews part of his own journey into exploring the claims of Christianity.  When he began, he was looking to prove Christianity as false.  As he continued his exploration, he became more open minded and finally crossed over to become a Christian after learning of the wide range of evidence.  He ended up concluding that it would take much more faith to continue as an atheist than it would to become a Christ follower.Throughout this film, Strobel talks to a wide range of experts from various fields as he conducts his investigation.This is certainly well worth watching, but only as a starting point.

1085832,A3D76ATDOKOMKT,B000SAGGPA,"Trish ""Lorica Lady""","[0, 5]","One of the speakers in this vid said that Yeshua drew from this & that source and had new things to say.  Another one said, ""He would clarify, sometimes even over rule, the Old Testament.""  The opposite is true.  Not once did Yeshua ever over rule anything in the ""Old"" Testament, only traditions of men teachings.  For example, when he healed on the Sabbath, when He told a man he healed to pick up his mat & go home & when He did not do ritual hand washings, He did not go against the ""Old"" Testament, but against the ""new"" oral traditions.I give this vid 2 stars because it has some scholarly merit.  However, the picture it presents of Yeshua is just not accurate.  Friends, learn the real Gospel.  See Acts 15 where Paul is telling nonJewish converts to refrain from blood & the meat of strangled animals (no throat slit means the blood is still in the animal, violating Mosaic law).  See Acts 21 where Paul takes a Mosaic vow to show that, contrary to rumors then and now, he did ""keep the Law of Moses.""  See the Apostles keeping Shavuot - not the phoney ""pentacost"", like the phoney ""Easter"" from the RC calendar - just as they are instructed by Moses to do so, & see the Holy Spirit coming down on them at that time.YHWH says He changes not.  Yeshua would never have done anything to change what YHWH said.  In fact, virtually all He said, Love one another, the Sermon on the Mount, love your enemies comes right from the ""Old"" Testament.  He fulfilled Isaiah 53, but He has not fulfilled all.  For example He has not come back.  He said not one jot or tittle of the Law or the Prophets would be ""changed until all is fulfilled.""YHWH said He does not change what goes out of His mouth.  Does He mean what He says & say what He means?  At Mt. Sinai He spoke the 10 Commandments to the Israelis wandering in the desert.  This included, of course, the Commandment - the longest one & the one said to be the very sign between YHWH and His people - to keep the 7th, not 1st day, holy & set apart to Him.Yeshua told those who would be fleeing after His death & resurrection to ""Pray that your flight not be in winter or on the Sabbath.""  Obviously He still wanted people to rest on the Sabbath.Paul never said the Sabbath was changed.  His words are misunderstood.  ""Let no man judge you"" spoken to former pagans does not mean ""Everyone do what is right in your own sight.""  Besides, think about it, did Paul have any authority to change what was spoken by YHWH, and written by His very finger in stone?  Do we?Do we look at the words of the actual Gospels and think for ourselves, or let ""scholars"" like those in this vid spin them, do our thinking for us, & cause us to follow traditions of men instead of the real truth?",2,"The traditions-of-men Yeshua/Jesus is presented, not the real one.",1289520000,"11 12, 2010",2010,2726,"['One', 'speakers', 'vid', 'said', 'Yeshua', 'drew', 'source', 'had', 'new', 'things', 'say', 'one', 'said', 'would', 'clarify', 'sometimes', 'even', 'rule', 'Old', 'Testament', 'opposite', 'true', 'Not', 'once', 'did', 'Yeshua', 'ever', 'rule', 'anything', 'Old', 'Testament', 'only', 'traditions', 'men', 'teachings', 'example', 'when', 'healed', 'Sabbath', 'when', 'told', 'man', 'healed', 'pick', 'up', 'mat', 'go', 'home', 'when', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'ritual', 'hand', 'washings', 'did', 'not', 'go', 'Old', 'Testament', 'new', 'oral', 'traditions.I', 'give', 'vid', '2', 'stars', 'scholarly', 'merit', 'However', 'picture', 'Yeshua', 'just', 'not', 'accurate', 'Friends', 'learn', 'real', 'Gospel', 'See', '15', 'where', 'Paul', 'telling', 'nonJewish', 'converts', 'refrain', 'blood', 'meat', 'strangled', 'animals', 'throat', 'slit', 'blood', 'still', 'animal', 'violating', 'Mosaic', 'law', 'See', '21', 'where', 'Paul', 'Mosaic', 'vow', 'show', 'contrary', 'rumors', 'then', 'now', 'did', 'keep', 'Law', 'Moses', 'See', 'Apostles', 'keeping', 'Shavuot', 'not', 'phoney', 'pentacost', 'phoney', 'Easter', 'RC', 'calendar', 'just', 'are', 'instructed', 'Moses', 'do', 'so', 'see', 'Holy', 'Spirit', 'coming', 'down', 'time.YHWH', 'not', 'Yeshua', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'done', 'anything', 'change', 'what', 'YHWH', 'said', 'fact', 'virtually', 'said', 'Love', 'one', 'Sermon', 'Mount', 'love', 'enemies', 'right', 'Old', 'Testament', 'fulfilled', 'Isaiah', '53', 'not', 'fulfilled', 'example', 'not', 'come', 'back', 'said', 'not', 'one', 'jot', 'tittle', 'Law', 'Prophets', 'would', 'be', 'changed', 'fulfilled', 'YHWH', 'said', 'not', 'change', 'what', 'mouth', 'mean', 'what', 'say', 'what', 'Mt', 'Sinai', 'spoke', '10', 'Commandments', 'Israelis', 'wandering', 'desert', 'included', 'course', 'Commandment', 'longest', 'one', 'one', 'said', 'be', 'very', 'sign', 'YHWH', 'people', 'keep', '7th', 'not', '1st', 'day', 'holy', 'set', 'apart', 'Him.Yeshua', 'told', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'fleeing', 'death', 'resurrection', 'Pray', 'flight', 'not', 'be', 'winter', 'Sabbath', 'Obviously', 'still', 'wanted', 'people', 'rest', 'Sabbath.Paul', 'never', 'said', 'Sabbath', 'was', 'changed', 'words', 'are', 'misunderstood', 'Let', 'man', 'judge', 'spoken', 'former', 'pagans', 'not', 'mean', 'Everyone', 'do', 'what', 'right', 'own', 'sight', 'think', 'did', 'Paul', 'have', 'authority', 'change', 'what', 'was', 'spoken', 'YHWH', 'written', 'very', 'finger', 'stone', 'Do', 'Do', 'look', 'words', 'actual', 'Gospels', 'think', 'let', 'scholars', 'vid', 'do', 'thinking', 'cause', 'follow', 'traditions', 'men', 'instead', 'real', 'truth']",N/A
