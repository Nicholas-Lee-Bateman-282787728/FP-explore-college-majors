908748,A1WMVV2AHMONSO,B0009NSDW0,Book & Music Lover,"[6, 6]","I thought these Movies would lead to the rebirth of the series, but alas not.  Then there was the all too soon death of Mr. Robert Urich, and then I knew it as all over.Though the movies tried to stick to the original story line it seem the producers were somewhat lost, or had never read, or seen the original series.  Good to see the producers try and fail, but quite a dissappointment.  Missing was the grittness of the original series, and the hard hitting street level story telling, the Robert Urich narration, quotes from some our famous classics writers.  Mr. Urich quoted these passages as if he had read them first hand.  I read somewhere that was all Mr. Urich, and he had read the books from which he quoted.I found these story lines somewhat naked, and lacking in depth, though all in all they were fair to say the least, though I did miss Spenser's original Lover.To sum it all up the movies are worth a look, but this all leaves me wondering why the producers have refused to realease the original series on DVD.

908750,A1IL6W1NK05UW9,B0009NSDW0,"C. Baker ""cbaker""","[1, 1]","I love Robert B. Parker's Spenser character.  As a kid growing up I also loved the television series.  Spenser and Hawk are, simply put, two of the greatest characters in crime fiction ever.These four Spenser movies starring Robert Urich as Spenser and Avery Brooks as Hawk, were produced in the mid-1990's and are nostalgic for me, reminding me of the television series.  That said they are made for television movies with all the flaws.  The supporting cast is pretty weak in terms of acting ability and the stories are just a tad less dramatic than the books.  It's kind of like watching the Lifetime Movie of Week for men.  So, overall, after seriously viewing these movies again, I have to say they are not all that good.  Urich and Brooks do make a great team though and while not totally true to Spenser, are close enough, and entertaining enough.The four movies in this collection are:CeremonyThe Judas GoatA Savage PlacePale Kings and Princes",3,Decent Movies if You Are a Spenser Fan,1184371200,"07 14, 2007",2007,951,"['love', 'Robert', 'B.', 'Parker', 'Spenser', 'character', 'kid', 'growing', 'up', 'also', 'loved', 'television', 'series', 'Spenser', 'Hawk', 'are', 'simply', 'put', 'two', 'greatest', 'characters', 'crime', 'fiction', 'ever.These', 'four', 'Spenser', 'movies', 'starring', 'Robert', 'Urich', 'Spenser', 'Avery', 'Brooks', 'Hawk', 'were', 'produced', 'mid-1990', 'are', 'nostalgic', 'reminding', 'television', 'series', 'said', 'are', 'made', 'television', 'movies', 'flaws', 'supporting', 'cast', 'pretty', 'weak', 'terms', 'acting', 'ability', 'stories', 'are', 'just', 'tad', 'less', 'dramatic', 'books', 'kind', 'watching', 'Lifetime', 'Movie', 'Week', 'men', 'So', 'overall', 'seriously', 'viewing', 'movies', 'again', 'have', 'say', 'are', 'not', 'good', 'Urich', 'Brooks', 'do', 'make', 'great', 'team', 'not', 'totally', 'true', 'Spenser', 'are', 'close', 'enough', 'entertaining', 'enough.The', 'four', 'movies', 'collection', 'are', 'CeremonyThe', 'Judas', 'GoatA', 'Savage', 'PlacePale', 'Kings', 'Princes']",Spenser For Hire - the Movie Collection
908751,A1WZY120DYDGO5,B0009NSDW0,"Collin D. Freeman ""collin_normal64""","[4, 5]","This group of 4 made-for TV movies are the first ones in which author Robert B. Parker and his wife Joan actually had some say in the scripts.  As other reviewers point out, potential weaknesses here for viewers are the absence of the TV series Susan Silverman (Barbara Stock) and moving the locations from Boston to Toronto.However, that having been said, if you are a fan of the novels (I've read most of them) over the Spenser:for Hire TV series (I only saw a handful), then you will find no better film adaptation of a Spenser novel than the first TV movie: Ceremony.  The surprise ending in the film even rivals the book!  Barbara Williams does an excellent job in my opinion as Susan Silverman, although taking nothing away from Barbara Stock's performance in the series.The second movie, Pale Kings and Princes, is almost as good as the first, and is very close to the novel. But here we start to see how Toronto locales begin to cause the film to suffer.The last two movies, Judas Goat and A Savage Place, are big unfortunate letdowns, again, in my  opinion.  Not only do we suffer from the location again, but also poor acting in some of the supporting roles, scripts departing too much from the novels, and finally Wendy Crewson replacing Barbara Williams is the final straw to moving these two films into no more than 2 stars.Having said that, if you are a fan of the novels as much as I, at least check out Ceremony.  It is worth the price  of the four DVDs together.One final note: Robert Urich is Spenser to me, despite how little I watched the TV series.  And there can be no one better to play Hawk than Avery Brooks.  He clearly understood the character.  I did not like the A&E; Spenser movies with Joe Montegna.  He is a fine actor, but I don't buy him as fun-loving private detective who is also an ex-prize fighter.  What weight class did he fight in?  Similarly none of the supporting characters were cast well.As Robert B. Parker pointed out early on in an interview about the Spenser for Hire series, there is the TV Spenser, and there is his Spenser from the novels.

It's a shame ABC/Lifetime was unable to get Barbara Stock and Ron McLarty to return as Susan and Belson or actually film these in Boston. I also don't understand why over the course of 4 films they needed 2 different actresses to play Susan(Barbara Williams was the better of the 2). Those quibbles aside, it was great to see Robert Urich as Spenser again. He's definitely better than the doughy Joe Mantegna, who played Spenser in 3 movies for A&E.

908755,A3C6R3PV0T3YMV,B0009NSDW0,Jeffrey D. Messer,"[96, 101]","They say Robert Parker grew unhappy with the network interpretation of Spenser. they even say he objected to Urich in the role. But Parker probably owes a lot more book sales to Urich's signature role as the smart and philosophical PI in boston.I loved this show when it aired, even though I was only 14 at the time.Avery Brooks was exceptional as Hawk. So much so, they spun him into a solo series that ultimately failed. It failed because whoever was in charge forgot what made Hawk so popular - his wiseass, tough guy personality. All those Hawk-eque qualities got down played in the Hawk series. So it was nice to see him return to the 4 movies in the early 90s. (His Hawk was so good, that Deep Space 9 eventually had him Hawk-ify his Commander role on that show).The lack of a regular Susan (or the return of the original) hurts these movies only slightly.And this time Parker took the reigns and adapted them from his books. Eventually, he adapted one or two more with Joe Mantagna as Spenser, but it never worked as well and the series of movies ceased. Parker has now moved on to Jesse Stone, his newest novel character and Tom Selleck has made one TV movie that is also excellent.Missing also here are original Belson actor and Lt Quark. But they play only minor roles.Unlike a TV episode, these are fully contained stories told over a larger canvas that takes more time and a more film like pace. Also missing is Boston as the city they film in - very noticable and saddening. Spenser drives a Ford Probe rather than the classic Mustang, which is also a let down. But those are only asthetic items.Let's hope that fans scoop these movies on DVD up, since word is that these are tests to see if the regular series 3 seasons are worth the time and effort to release.

My anticipation quickly dried up - replaced by a sense of shock and sorrow...""Ceremony"", the first chronologically of these Made-for-TV movies, bears the closest resemblance to the TV series.  Robert Urich (Spenser) and Avery Brooks (Hawk) do their usual stellar work and the movie has the feel (and strength of story line) close to the original Spenser series.  It's a touch off, in terms of quality, but forgivable for Spenser fans.The other movies here - Pale Kings and Princes, The Judas Goat, and A Savage Place - are a disappointment, at best.  I could certainly use the terms ""pale"" and ""savage"" from the individual titles in describing these poor attempts at recreating the feel and strength of the Spenser TV series, but I'll leave that to your imagination...  But to sum up the experience: I found watching these three painful - especially considering Urich and Brooks, who I consider excellent actors and all-around ""classy"", seemed surrounded - perhaps trapped - by thin story lines and poor acting that not even they could save.Bottom line?  Far from satisfying, this collection deeply disappoints and I don't know that there are adequate words to fully describe that disappointment.

908759,A3TUZOJZM9008Y,B0009NSDW0,"Michael A. Brown ""maniacmedia""","[142, 148]","Perhaps the signature role in Robert Urich's too short career. Spenser, with an 's' like the poet, was a tough talking Private Eye in Boston. He likes to cook, and he loves Susan Silverman. He garners help on a regular basis from Hawk, a former mob enforcer who respects what Spenser stands for.The first two of these movies are decent enough. They capture some of the flavor of the TV show. Although the production moved from Boston to Toronto to cut costs. Also in a cost-cutting measure, they replaced the series' Susan (Barbara Stock) with Barbara Williams and later Wendy Crewson. (A move that Urich admitted was a bad one.) ABC produced the first two movies after cancelling the series. The latter two were produced for Lifetime Television.Robert B. Parker, who penned the novels on which the series was based, co-wrote the first two of these movies with his wife. The quality of the first two scripts notwithstanding, the productions suffered from the move to Toronto. While it is a beautiful city, it doesn't have the same feel as Beantown.The latter two cable movies are a hollow shell of what made the show great. It's basically a cut-and-paste job.That having been said, I would guess that Warner Bros. is keeping a close eye on the sales of this set to decide if they'll release the great series on DVD.
