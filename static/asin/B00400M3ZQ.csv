In fact, I'm upset that I wasted 90 minutes and $4 on this ""film"". Its about two men who have sex and film it - and most of it you can't see because the screen is either pitch black or the view of the actors is obstructed. Oh, one of the actors is nice enough to buy food during the film(gee, thanks!)Please people, stay away from this.",1,Complete Garbage,1348963200,"09 30, 2012",2012,419,"['Thank', 'goodness', 'only', 'rented', 'film', 'had', 'bought', ""'d"", 'be', 'furious', 'fact', ""'m"", 'upset', 'wasted', '90', 'minutes', '4', 'film', 'two', 'men', 'who', 'have', 'sex', 'film', 'most', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'screen', 'pitch', 'black', 'view', 'actors', 'obstructed', 'Oh', 'one', 'actors', 'nice', 'enough', 'buy', 'food', 'film', 'gee', 'thanks', 'Please', 'people', 'stay', 'away']",Unfaithful
1378606,ACDSIABGNEQ1,B00400M3ZQ,"Lawrence J. Ukolowicz ""LJU""","[15, 17]","This movie has me baffled.  I liked it and again, I didn't.  The director says 'this is not porn'.  Two men, nude and having sex to completion and filming it, sort of borders on porn.  But again, they talk about the experience.  Would they do it again?  Both said 'yes'.  They talked of themselves and how they viewed sex.  They engaged in sensual touching, kissing and stopped to talk about it.  I did not like the beginning that was mostly in the dark when they just talked.  I mean literally a black screen with one of the guys smoking.  All you saw was the guy lighting either a cigarette or joint.  Sorry, it was dark, I couldn't see what it was!  I wanted that to be lighted just like the rest of the movie was.  It was distracting and I almost turned it off because it did not hold my attention.  If you can get past that, then you might enjoy, or not enjoy the film.  Would I watch it again?  No.  It left me cold and indifferent.  Even though they shared their feelings, it just did not click with me.  Here's the bottom line.  If you always wanted to see a porn film with talking and emotional journeys, this is for  you.  You can decide if it is porn or not.  To me, it was porn and it took too long to get to a climax.  I'd rather watch a Joe Gage film.  I give it 4 stars because I admire the director for taking a chance with this film.  I like people who take chances.",4,Porn or Not Porn,1291075200,"11 30, 2010",2010,1383,"['movie', 'baffled', 'liked', 'again', 'did', ""n't"", 'director', ""'this"", 'not', 'porn', 'Two', 'men', 'nude', 'having', 'sex', 'completion', 'filming', 'sort', 'borders', 'porn', 'again', 'talk', 'experience', 'Would', 'do', 'again', 'Both', 'said', 'talked', 'how', 'viewed', 'sex', 'engaged', 'sensual', 'touching', 'kissing', 'stopped', 'talk', 'did', 'not', 'beginning', 'was', 'mostly', 'dark', 'when', 'just', 'talked', 'mean', 'literally', 'black', 'screen', 'one', 'guys', 'smoking', 'saw', 'was', 'guy', 'lighting', 'cigarette', 'joint', 'Sorry', 'was', 'dark', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'what', 'was', 'wanted', 'be', 'lighted', 'just', 'rest', 'movie', 'was', 'was', 'distracting', 'almost', 'turned', 'off', 'did', 'not', 'hold', 'attention', 'can', 'get', 'past', 'then', 'might', 'enjoy', 'not', 'enjoy', 'film', 'Would', 'watch', 'again', 'No', 'left', 'cold', 'indifferent', 'Even', 'shared', 'feelings', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'click', 'Here', 'bottom', 'line', 'always', 'wanted', 'see', 'porn', 'film', 'talking', 'emotional', 'journeys', 'can', 'decide', 'porn', 'not', 'was', 'porn', 'took', 'too', 'long', 'get', 'climax', ""'d"", 'rather', 'watch', 'Joe', 'Gage', 'film', 'give', '4', 'stars', 'admire', 'director', 'taking', 'chance', 'film', 'people', 'who', 'take', 'chances']",Unfaithful
