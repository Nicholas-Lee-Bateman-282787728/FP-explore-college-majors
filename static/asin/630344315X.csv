Seriously, this film is ALL ABOUT LINDA, and she delivers a tour-de-force that is one of the finest performances of the 90's, period.  With a `take no prisoners' attitude and a strut that is sure to bring every man to his knees, Fiorentino doesn't pull any punches and instead creates one of the most memorable onscreen vixens I've ever had the pleasure of watching.The film follows Bridget as she steals a ton of money from her husband after she pressures him into going into a drug deal with some drug dealers.  She then flees New York for Beston and hooks up with a nave young man looking for a reason to feel better than he is and she winds up using him, first for pleasure and then eventually manipulating him into a murder plot against her husband, all the while keeping her new lover in the dark as to her true intentions.Thank god no one copped out with that killer finale!Fiorentino eats up every ounce of screentime here, delivering an iconic portrayal of a manipulative, destructive and selfish woman.  She is pure evil, but the kind you can't help but salivate over.  Bill Pullman delivers his best performance, at least that I've seen, and Peter Berg is effectively capture by Fiorentino's seductive ways.  The plot twists towards the end (revealed secrets) are strangely enticing and keep the film interesting and the wrap us is just pitch perfect.Not for the faint of heart, but certainly a worthwhile ride.",5,Seductive is right!,1375833600,"08 7, 2013",2013,1564,"['When', 'created', 'term', 'Femme', 'Fatale', 'created', 'characters', 'Bridget', 'Gregory', 'performances', 'Linda', 'Fiorentino', 'Seriously', 'film', 'ABOUT', 'LINDA', 'tour-de-force', 'one', 'finest', 'performances', '90', 'period', 'take', 'prisoners', 'attitude', 'strut', 'sure', 'bring', 'man', 'knees', 'Fiorentino', ""n't"", 'pull', 'punches', 'instead', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'onscreen', 'vixens', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'had', 'pleasure', 'watching.The', 'film', 'Bridget', 'ton', 'money', 'husband', 'going', 'drug', 'deal', 'drug', 'dealers', 'then', 'New', 'York', 'Beston', 'up', 'nave', 'young', 'man', 'looking', 'reason', 'feel', 'better', 'up', 'using', 'first', 'pleasure', 'then', 'eventually', 'manipulating', 'murder', 'plot', 'husband', 'while', 'keeping', 'new', 'lover', 'dark', 'true', 'intentions.Thank', 'god', 'one', 'copped', 'out', 'killer', 'finale', 'Fiorentino', 'up', 'ounce', 'screentime', 'here', 'delivering', 'iconic', 'portrayal', 'manipulative', 'destructive', 'selfish', 'woman', 'pure', 'evil', 'kind', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'salivate', 'Bill', 'Pullman', 'best', 'performance', 'least', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Peter', 'Berg', 'effectively', 'capture', 'Fiorentino', 'seductive', 'ways', 'plot', 'end', 'revealed', 'secrets', 'are', 'strangely', 'enticing', 'keep', 'film', 'interesting', 'wrap', 'just', 'pitch', 'perfect.Not', 'faint', 'heart', 'certainly', 'worthwhile', 'ride']",Last Seduction VHS
374871,A1PASRZ81DY9C,630344315X,Austin Somlo,"[1, 5]","Viewed: 7/11Rate: 37/11: Dumb, dumb, dumb movie. I just knew it was going to be terrible within fifteen minutes. The Last Seduction managed to pull all the possible tricks out of a book and tried to look good doing it. Only that the whole film was an exercise of stupidity. I hate films like that. It was pure manipulation right from the start, not that kind of manipulation that Bridget was displaying, but the kind that forced Mike to do things that he was doing. Sure, it happens to people nowadays that compel them to commit criminal actions that they would normally not do, but however, the case with Mike, it's just not simply possible based on length of time spent knowing her and the way he had a contrived relationship with her. There could be a chemical imbalance working against Mike, but there will be a point in his head that he would realize that the ideas were getting out of hand. If the film was about teenage characters, I might accept it more. However, I already saw Body Heat. So, it's all too familiar to me. Speaking of lack of intelligence, let's just go on a list. One, private detectives aren't that stupid, so if Clay handpicked him, he would have been at least intelligent to begin with. Two, no private detective was willing to accept to eat or drink anything made by the person that he was assigned to. Three, if the tires were blown, fine...just notice the name of the cab company and get the taxi number. Hire another shadow on her while being arrested. Even being a private detective is enough to warrant a mistake. Four, no private detective was that stupid enough to show his penis just to prove a point. I mean, what the hell for? Five, if Mike had a traumatizing episode with a transsexual, fine...then, he will go back to his roots and trust the ones he was normally associated with, and that would mean he would be going for Stacy, the good looking tanned blonde in the bar, not just some stranger for a deja vu. He just didn't have the heart to do it again. Even Stacy was better looking than Trish and Wendy combined. Six, if Mike had friends, what happened to them in the rest of the film? Seven, no respectable insurance company would allow somebody to work under an alias and avoid any social security check. Seven, the lawyer disappeared? Eight, if Clay knew where his wife was, why didn't he go to Beston and start trouble for her? Nine, yeah...like I believe, out of all words, Clay decided to focus on New York and used it as a clever way to find Bridget's alias. If he was so smart, how come he was so stupid? Ten, if Wendy was going to make references to Double Indemnity, did that ruin a film already? Eleven, Mike, being a Claim Adjustor with a wealth of similar experiences, would have been prepared for this. Twelve, having sex in front of a bar entrance and being unseen doing it, yeah, that will work...not. Anyway, some had said that The Last Seduction was a sexy film and also Linda Fiorentino...are you friggin' kidding me? She was like Sharon Stone but worse...all that smoke, deep voice, and no figure. Wow, that ending sure sucked. I must copy some lines from skiop who said,""But Mike has really got her (Bridget) beat in the lack-of-brains department. He first meets her in a bar, where she tries to blow him off. But he persists. Why? She's a skinny, flat-chested, coarse-voiced shrew. A really good-looking guy like that could surely get a nicer, better-looking woman, but he wants Bridget, for no obvious reason.When they do start their (purely physical) ""relationship,"" he gets distressed that she's so cold and distant. She's emotionally unavailable, but he keeps pursuing, for no other reason than furthering the mundane plot. He should have gotten out when he had the chance; when the finale arrives, we're not sure whether we pity him or whether we're annoyed by him.""Well, that was a dead-on comment. All in all, I actually survived The Last Seduction thanks to Peter Berg's presence, but the rest of it was craptacular. You are better off seeing Body Heat, a believable film with a believable plot featuring believable performances by a believable cast.",2,Yawn...Spare Me the Comedy.,1311379200,"07 23, 2011",2011,4125,"['Viewed', '7/11Rate', '37/11', 'Dumb', 'dumb', 'dumb', 'movie', 'just', 'knew', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'terrible', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'Last', 'Seduction', 'managed', 'pull', 'possible', 'tricks', 'book', 'tried', 'look', 'good', 'doing', 'Only', 'whole', 'film', 'was', 'exercise', 'stupidity', 'hate', 'films', 'was', 'pure', 'manipulation', 'right', 'start', 'not', 'kind', 'manipulation', 'Bridget', 'was', 'displaying', 'kind', 'forced', 'Mike', 'do', 'things', 'was', 'doing', 'Sure', 'people', 'nowadays', 'compel', 'commit', 'criminal', 'actions', 'would', 'normally', 'not', 'do', 'however', 'case', 'Mike', 'just', 'not', 'simply', 'possible', 'based', 'length', 'time', 'spent', 'knowing', 'way', 'had', 'contrived', 'relationship', 'could', 'be', 'chemical', 'imbalance', 'working', 'Mike', 'will', 'be', 'point', 'head', 'would', 'realize', 'ideas', 'were', 'getting', 'hand', 'film', 'was', 'teenage', 'characters', 'might', 'accept', 'more', 'However', 'already', 'saw', 'Body', 'Heat', 'So', 'too', 'familiar', 'Speaking', 'lack', 'intelligence', 'let', 'just', 'go', 'list', 'One', 'private', 'detectives', 'are', ""n't"", 'stupid', 'so', 'Clay', 'handpicked', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'least', 'intelligent', 'begin', 'Two', 'private', 'detective', 'was', 'willing', 'accept', 'eat', 'drink', 'anything', 'made', 'person', 'was', 'assigned', 'Three', 'tires', 'were', 'blown', 'fine', 'just', 'name', 'cab', 'company', 'get', 'taxi', 'number', 'Hire', 'shadow', 'being', 'arrested', 'Even', 'being', 'private', 'detective', 'enough', 'warrant', 'mistake', 'Four', 'private', 'detective', 'was', 'stupid', 'enough', 'show', 'penis', 'just', 'prove', 'point', 'mean', 'what', 'hell', 'Five', 'Mike', 'had', 'traumatizing', 'episode', 'transsexual', 'fine', 'then', 'will', 'go', 'back', 'roots', 'trust', 'ones', 'was', 'normally', 'associated', 'would', 'mean', 'would', 'be', 'going', 'Stacy', 'good', 'looking', 'tanned', 'blonde', 'bar', 'not', 'just', 'stranger', 'deja', 'vu', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'heart', 'do', 'again', 'Even', 'Stacy', 'was', 'better', 'looking', 'Trish', 'Wendy', 'combined', 'Six', 'Mike', 'had', 'friends', 'what', 'happened', 'rest', 'film', 'Seven', 'respectable', 'insurance', 'company', 'would', 'allow', 'somebody', 'work', 'alias', 'avoid', 'social', 'security', 'check', 'Seven', 'lawyer', 'disappeared', 'Eight', 'Clay', 'knew', 'where', 'wife', 'was', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'Beston', 'start', 'trouble', 'Nine', 'yeah', 'believe', 'words', 'Clay', 'decided', 'focus', 'New', 'York', 'used', 'clever', 'way', 'find', 'Bridget', 'alias', 'was', 'so', 'smart', 'how', 'come', 'was', 'so', 'stupid', 'Ten', 'Wendy', 'was', 'going', 'make', 'references', 'Double', 'Indemnity', 'did', 'ruin', 'film', 'already', 'Eleven', 'Mike', 'being', 'Claim', 'Adjustor', 'wealth', 'similar', 'experiences', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'prepared', 'Twelve', 'having', 'sex', 'front', 'bar', 'entrance', 'being', 'unseen', 'doing', 'yeah', 'will', 'work', 'not', 'Anyway', 'had', 'said', 'Last', 'Seduction', 'was', 'sexy', 'film', 'also', 'Linda', 'Fiorentino', 'are', 'friggin', 'kidding', 'was', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'worse', 'smoke', 'deep', 'voice', 'figure', 'Wow', 'ending', 'sure', 'sucked', 'must', 'copy', 'lines', 'skiop', 'who', 'said', 'Mike', 'really', 'got', 'Bridget', 'beat', 'lack-of-brains', 'department', 'first', 'bar', 'where', 'blow', 'off', 'Why', 'skinny', 'flat-chested', 'coarse-voiced', 'shrew', 'really', 'good-looking', 'guy', 'could', 'surely', 'get', 'nicer', 'better-looking', 'woman', 'Bridget', 'obvious', 'reason.When', 'do', 'start', 'purely', 'physical', 'relationship', 'distressed', 'so', 'cold', 'distant', 'emotionally', 'unavailable', 'pursuing', 'other', 'reason', 'furthering', 'mundane', 'plot', 'should', 'have', 'gotten', 'out', 'when', 'had', 'chance', 'when', 'finale', ""'re"", 'not', 'sure', 'pity', ""'re"", 'annoyed', 'Well', 'was', 'dead-on', 'comment', 'actually', 'survived', 'Last', 'Seduction', 'thanks', 'Peter', 'Berg', 'presence', 'rest', 'was', 'craptacular', 'are', 'better', 'off', 'seeing', 'Body', 'Heat', 'believable', 'film', 'believable', 'plot', 'featuring', 'believable', 'performances', 'believable', 'cast']",Last Seduction VHS

Erickson ""boycorrupted""","[7, 8]","there are movies that shouldn't work, that have no right to work, movies that are in many respects asinine and ridiculous and clumsy and superficial - yet they do work, and the thanks is due to the presence of actors with alchemical charisma, capable of transmuting lost causes into ""riveting psychological studies"" on the pure power of personality. imagine any other actor than sharon stone delivering those supremely corny lines in ""basic instinct.""  it's her eerie confidence that allows you to ""suspend you disbelief"" even though you actually saw her commit the crime in the first scene.  the more outrageous the propositions she can cajole you into accepting, the more exhilerating the ride.this is exactly why ""the last seduction"" is so successful a film. the script couldve been written by a slightly precocious and masochistic high school kid. if you wrote down the dialogue and read it back silently you'd swear you'd just transcribed some godforsaken hbo b-movie. well, you would have. even hbo gets lucky occassionally. in this case, they ought to have thanked the cinematic gods for linda fiorentino. she not only rescues ""the last seduction"" from complete imbecility - she elevates it to a ""near-masterpiece of the neo-noir spider-woman canon"", as roger ebert might (and probably did) say. remember barbra stanwyck in ""double indemnity""? you won't after you see this. in fact there is really no comparison in film. bridget (aka ""wendy"") describes herself - while slamming her fists against the roof of her jeep astride her boyfriend - in terms that i can't employ on amazon, but it rhymes with ""trucking witch"", and nobody is going to disagree with her.  she is capable of anything and everything up-to-and-including murder, on a whim, for convenience's sake, without the slightest hint of remorse, and she's thoroughly capable of getting away with it. her single human emotion is greed. since her greed is focused on conventional ends - sex, money, power - we can all relate; what's shocking is the utter ultimacy of her greed, and her uncanny ability to exploit her situation, however doubtful it seems, using the most vile and heartless methods conceivable, and come out smelling like a rose. of course, that's where the plot strains our imagination; but the burden is on the actor. if she fails to radiate an aura diabolical enough to convince us of her complete mastery of her environment, we'll notice the fact that the plot is illogically propped up on all sides to support her, and the whole spell of the movie will be broken. needless to say, that's not a problem here. our first glimpse of bridget finds her barking orders at a sweatshop full of telemarketing scammers as they hawk ""commemorative coins"" at dumb old ladies in jersey. prowling around like a dominatrix, taunting them with a stack of bills, she is totally convincing in her power; she's a being to be reckoned with not because of anything you know about her - nothing yet - but because of her presence, one of authority and emotional detachment with a bias towards menace. later she plays with a guy who hits on her in a bar (quite literally), decides to have sex with him on a whim purely for pleasure, just as a man would do; and then when he, taking the traditionally ""female"" role in response, extends himself to her emotionally, she exploits his gullability in sundry creative ways, ultimately convincing him to kill for her as part of an insurance scam. now that's classic noir. he's even characterized as a small-town country boy, and she swoops in on him from the big bad city and destroys him, in a recapitulation of a classic motif from the original 40's films noir - the metropolis as eroder of ethics and values and the patriarchal order. as bridget snarls at one point:""spare me your brainless countrified morality!"" you've just got to see her in action. fiorentino's performance is a flawless gem in a meagre setting, but that's enough - that's what makes a movie.",5,come on you eunuchs.,1017014400,"03 25, 2002",2002,3966,"['are', 'movies', 'should', ""n't"", 'work', 'have', 'right', 'work', 'movies', 'are', 'many', 'respects', 'asinine', 'ridiculous', 'clumsy', 'superficial', 'yet', 'do', 'work', 'thanks', 'due', 'presence', 'actors', 'alchemical', 'charisma', 'capable', 'transmuting', 'lost', 'causes', 'riveting', 'psychological', 'studies', 'pure', 'power', 'personality', 'imagine', 'other', 'actor', 'sharon', 'stone', 'delivering', 'supremely', 'corny', 'lines', 'basic', 'instinct', 'eerie', 'confidence', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'even', 'actually', 'saw', 'commit', 'crime', 'first', 'scene', 'more', 'outrageous', 'propositions', 'can', 'cajole', 'accepting', 'more', 'exhilerating', 'ride.this', 'exactly', 'why', 'last', 'seduction', 'so', 'successful', 'film', 'script', 'couldve', 'been', 'written', 'slightly', 'precocious', 'masochistic', 'high', 'school', 'kid', 'wrote', 'dialogue', 'read', 'back', 'silently', ""'d"", 'swear', ""'d"", 'just', 'transcribed', 'godforsaken', 'hbo', 'b-movie', 'well', 'would', 'have', 'even', 'hbo', 'lucky', 'occassionally', 'case', 'ought', 'have', 'thanked', 'cinematic', 'gods', 'linda', 'fiorentino', 'not', 'only', 'last', 'seduction', 'complete', 'imbecility', 'near-masterpiece', 'neo-noir', 'spider-woman', 'canon', 'roger', 'ebert', 'might', 'probably', 'did', 'say', 'remember', 'barbra', 'stanwyck', 'double', 'indemnity', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'fact', 'really', 'comparison', 'film', 'bridget', 'wendy', 'slamming', 'fists', 'roof', 'jeep', 'boyfriend', 'terms', 'i', 'ca', ""n't"", 'employ', 'amazon', 'trucking', 'witch', 'nobody', 'going', 'disagree', 'capable', 'anything', 'everything', 'up-to-and-including', 'murder', 'whim', 'convenience', 'sake', 'slightest', 'hint', 'remorse', 'thoroughly', 'capable', 'getting', 'away', 'single', 'human', 'emotion', 'greed', 'greed', 'focused', 'conventional', 'ends', 'sex', 'money', 'power', 'can', 'relate', 'what', 'shocking', 'utter', 'ultimacy', 'greed', 'uncanny', 'ability', 'exploit', 'situation', 'however', 'doubtful', 'using', 'most', 'vile', 'heartless', 'methods', 'conceivable', 'come', 'out', 'smelling', 'rose', 'course', 'where', 'plot', 'imagination', 'burden', 'actor', 'radiate', 'aura', 'diabolical', 'enough', 'convince', 'complete', 'mastery', 'environment', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'fact', 'plot', 'illogically', 'propped', 'up', 'sides', 'support', 'whole', 'spell', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'broken', 'needless', 'say', 'not', 'problem', 'here', 'first', 'glimpse', 'bridget', 'barking', 'orders', 'sweatshop', 'full', 'telemarketing', 'scammers', 'hawk', 'commemorative', 'coins', 'dumb', 'old', 'ladies', 'jersey', 'prowling', 'dominatrix', 'taunting', 'stack', 'bills', 'totally', 'convincing', 'power', 'being', 'be', 'reckoned', 'not', 'anything', 'know', 'nothing', 'yet', 'presence', 'one', 'authority', 'emotional', 'detachment', 'bias', 'menace', 'later', 'guy', 'who', 'bar', 'quite', 'literally', 'have', 'sex', 'whim', 'purely', 'pleasure', 'just', 'man', 'would', 'do', 'then', 'when', 'taking', 'traditionally', 'female', 'role', 'response', 'emotionally', 'gullability', 'sundry', 'creative', 'ways', 'ultimately', 'convincing', 'kill', 'part', 'insurance', 'scam', 'now', 'classic', 'noir', 'even', 'characterized', 'small-town', 'country', 'boy', 'big', 'bad', 'city', 'recapitulation', 'classic', 'motif', 'original', '40', 'films', 'metropolis', 'eroder', 'ethics', 'values', 'patriarchal', 'order', 'bridget', 'snarls', 'one', 'point', 'spare', 'brainless', 'countrified', 'morality', ""'ve"", 'just', 'got', 'see', 'action', 'fiorentino', 'performance', 'flawless', 'gem', 'meagre', 'setting', 'enough', 'what', 'movie']",Last Seduction VHS

374875,A95SF04RX9G8,630344315X,"Christopher Moyer ""moyer.privatjokr.com""","[2, 5]","The femme fatale was a staple of 1940s film noir: an unusually attractive and downright coldhearted woman who knows how to get what she wants by using her own femininity and sexuality to lure unsuspecting men into her trap. She's often the smartest character in the film, able to play everyone else like a piano, and do anything it takes for power and money. The Last Seduction recalls this great archetype and gives us a femme fatale so evil that it's just a joy to watch her operate.Linda Fiorentino plays the woman in question, Bridget Gregory, who right off the bat steals $700,000 from her husband, Clay (Bill Pullman), who got that money from illegally selling drugs that was able to acquire as a doctor. Bridget hightails it out of New York City and ends up hiding out in a town called Beston in upstate New York, where she plans to live under an assumed name, Wendy Kroy, until things cool down and she can return to New York.It is in Beston that she meets her patsy, a local man seeking love and affection named Mike (Peter Berg), who falls hard for ""Wendy"" when he meets her in a bar. Bridget uses Mike for sex, but he constantly tries to pry into her personal life, which she will have no part of. She scares him a bit when she starts talking about killing bad men for money, and when he will not relent with his quest for personal details, she pushes back on him about his secret from when he lived in Buffalo. Despite all of this, Mike cannot resist her charms, but we get the feeling that something bad is going to go down when Clay finally catches up with Bridget--that is, unless she can get to him first.The Last Seduction was directed by John Dahl, and originally played on cable TV after being passed over by distributors. After it proved to be a great success, the film then received a theatrical release--quite an unusual scenario. At any rate, this is a very good film with some excellent characters. Bridget is the kind of character that you love to hate, because she manages to manipulate situations so well, and even though she's diabolical, you have to give her credit, because she's damn smart and she knows exactly what she's doing.However, I make a judgment on recommending a film based on whether I would add the movie to my DVD collection, and with this film, I didn't feel any special desire to do so.

I hesitated for two reasons. One was the reviews which frequently mentioned ""plot holes."" Do reviewers just suspect there are plot holes, then feel compelled to make the accusation without any firm evidence to back it up? I have seen a couple of reviews for other films where plot holes are specifically addressed, but it's very rare. There may be plot holes in ""The Last Seduction,"" but I didn't notice them. And when Fiorentino's character (Bridget) burns a piece of evidence at the film's end, it certainly makes a case that the writers were not slack with the details. The other point that made me hesitate was the full screen treatment, and claims of a poor quality film transfer. I'm a widescreen viewer, but please do not let this full screen treatment discourage you. As for the quality of the film, it's a bit grainy, but I felt that actually gave the movie more of a gritty ""film noir"" look. There may have been two or three fleeting artifacts, but I've seen as many on many films praised for their image quality. I didn't notice any compression problems at all, and the sound quality was consistently good. So, if you're hesitating, as I was, let me nudge you to the checkout counter. This is an excellent movie.

374888,ARMH3GNZ83JGQ,630344315X,John Margaritis,"[4, 6]","Linda Fiorentino stars as the ultimate bad girl in this little thriller directed by John Dahl; Bill Pullman, JT Walsh, and Peter Berg round out the strong cast.  The plot revolves around some money that Clay(Pullman), a doctor selling drugs illegally, has just made a deal for and brought home to his wife, Bridget(Fiorentino).  After getting into a fight in which Clay slaps Bridget, she takes off with the money.  She procedes to some small upstate town where she decides to try to hide out for a while and see what Clay knows about her whereabouts.  After talking to a lawyer friend(Walsh), she weighs her options and decides to set up shop temporarily and get a job in an insurance company.  While not exactly fitting into Smalltown, USA, she nonetheless finds herself being pursued by an extremely naive local-yokel by the name of Mike Swale(Berg).  The two hook up for some steamy no-strings-attached sex until Mike confesses that he loves her.  Bridget decides she has him in the palm of her hand and launches into a plot to rid herself of him, her husband, and anything else that stands in the way of that large sum of illegal money.I thought the film started off well enough, but as the plot developed I found myself having a few problems with the film.  First off, the Bridget character is so completely unlikable and just downright nasty that I found myself really hating her right from the opening frames of the film, which is a problem if you are basing the whole film around her.  I'm all for the femme fatale thing, but I find it more effective when the woman is more cunning, subtlely seducing the unsuspecting male victim--and viewer-- into a false sense of security and then hitting you over the head with a I-didn't-see-that-coming plot twist.  Bridget is hardly subtle.  In fact, she doesn't use trickery to get her male victims to do what she wants, she just asks them to do stupid things and they willingly oblige.  One scene in particular that really irked me is when Bridget is tracked down by this seemingly buisness-like black private eye hired by her husband.  He points a gun at her and tells her to drive.  She then asks him if the thing about black guys having a big, you know, is true and then asks him to whip it out so she can see for herself.  He says no at first and then decides to do it if she'll shut up.  That was the point in the story where I said what the...?  I thought that scene was so ridiculous.  Later on there is another scene that equals or surpasses that scene in the-men-behaving-stupidly theme.I really liked Dahl's work in Red Rock West, so I felt somewhat let down by this film.  A few times I thought he took shortcuts to get a particular scene to work instead of putting some more thought into it.  The film does move at a strong pace and features some very good performances, but some of the problems I mentioned earlier left me disappointed.

Bernabo,"[23, 26]","If you are looking for a smart thriller, where you go along for the ride because you are never going to be able to catch up with what is going on, then &quot;The Last Seduction&quot; is a prime choice for your late night enjoyment.  Directed by John Dahl and written by Steve Baranci, this 1994 film begins with Bridget Gregory (Linda Fiorentino) lording it over an office of telemarketers trying to sell collectible coins.  Meanwhile, her husband Clay (Bill Pullman) has pulled his first drug deal and netted $700,000.  However, as they talk about celebrating he makes the mistake of slapping her and by the time he gets out of the shower she has disappeared with the money.  Of course, by the end of the movie when he are thinking that Clay made a mistake marrying Bridget in the first place.  Bridget calls up her lawyer (J.T. Walsh) to find out what her options are preserving stolen money as a marital asset when she gets a divorce while Clay hires a private eye (Bill Nunn) to find her and get his money back because he has a loan shark who is not happy with him.The obvious historical antecedent for &quot;The Last Seduction&quot; is &quot;Double Indemnity,&quot; and when Bridget takes the name Wendy Kroy (look at it backwards) and starts working for an insurance company it is hard not to notice the similarities (that and she calls herself Mrs. Neff at one point).  However, before that happens she hooks up with Mike Swale (Peter Berg) at a bar and is less than thrilled to see that he works there two.  They continue to meet at the bar for sex and he keeps trying to get closer, but she is still on the run and needs to come up with a way of saving her life and the keeping the money (not necessarily in that order).&quot;The Last Seduction&quot; begins trying to lull you into thinking this is a romantic comedy (my wife kept saying &quot;You said this was a thriller, this is not the music of a thriller&quot;), but then things take a more serious turn.  Once that happens the twists and turns just keep coming as Linda Fiorentino makes Barbara Stanwyck's Phyllis Dietrichson look like a prim and proper little schoolgirl.  Unfortunately, &quot;The Last Seduction&quot; was shown on television before its theatrical release, which put the kibosh on any hopes of Fiorentino getting an Oscar nomination.  Yes, the character is that memorable, as good at being bad as anyone you can recall and she never, ever lets the mask slip away as this mistress of improvisation takes care of everyone and everything in her own sweet way.There are no extras of any kind on this DVD, which actually is a good thing.  That is because this is the sort of film that should really stand on its own without a look behind the curtain and it makes perfect sense that there are not any deleted scenes.  Even a trailer might give away too much of the game.  This might not be a great film, but it is very, very good and worth a late night viewing.",5,A smart thriller in the tradition of &quot;Double Indemnity&quot;,1056153600,"06 21, 2003",2003,2938,"['are', 'looking', 'smart', 'thriller', 'where', 'go', 'along', 'ride', 'are', 'never', 'going', 'be', 'able', 'catch', 'up', 'what', 'going', 'then', 'quot', 'Last', 'Seduction', 'quot', 'prime', 'choice', 'late', 'night', 'enjoyment', 'Directed', 'John', 'Dahl', 'written', 'Steve', 'Baranci', '1994', 'film', 'Bridget', 'Gregory', 'Linda', 'Fiorentino', 'lording', 'office', 'telemarketers', 'trying', 'sell', 'collectible', 'coins', 'Meanwhile', 'husband', 'Clay', 'Bill', 'Pullman', 'pulled', 'first', 'drug', 'deal', 'netted', '700,000', 'However', 'talk', 'celebrating', 'mistake', 'slapping', 'time', 'shower', 'disappeared', 'money', 'course', 'end', 'movie', 'when', 'are', 'thinking', 'Clay', 'made', 'mistake', 'marrying', 'Bridget', 'first', 'place', 'Bridget', 'up', 'lawyer', 'J.T', 'Walsh', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'options', 'are', 'preserving', 'stolen', 'money', 'marital', 'asset', 'when', 'divorce', 'Clay', 'private', 'eye', 'Bill', 'Nunn', 'find', 'get', 'money', 'back', 'loan', 'shark', 'who', 'not', 'happy', 'him.The', 'obvious', 'historical', 'antecedent', 'quot', 'Last', 'Seduction', 'quot', 'quot', 'Double', 'Indemnity', 'quot', 'when', 'Bridget', 'name', 'Wendy', 'Kroy', 'look', 'backwards', 'working', 'insurance', 'company', 'hard', 'not', 'notice', 'similarities', 'Mrs.', 'Neff', 'one', 'point', 'However', 'up', 'Mike', 'Swale', 'Peter', 'Berg', 'bar', 'less', 'thrilled', 'see', 'there', 'two', 'continue', 'meet', 'bar', 'sex', 'trying', 'get', 'closer', 'still', 'run', 'come', 'up', 'way', 'saving', 'life', 'keeping', 'money', 'not', 'necessarily', 'order', 'quot', 'Last', 'Seduction', 'quot', 'trying', 'lull', 'thinking', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'wife', 'kept', 'saying', 'quot', 'said', 'was', 'thriller', 'not', 'music', 'thriller', 'quot', 'then', 'things', 'take', 'more', 'serious', 'turn', 'Once', 'twists', 'just', 'keep', 'coming', 'Linda', 'Fiorentino', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'Phyllis', 'Dietrichson', 'look', 'prim', 'proper', 'little', 'schoolgirl', 'Unfortunately', 'quot', 'Last', 'Seduction', 'quot', 'was', 'shown', 'television', 'theatrical', 'release', 'put', 'kibosh', 'hopes', 'Fiorentino', 'getting', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Yes', 'character', 'memorable', 'good', 'being', 'bad', 'anyone', 'can', 'recall', 'never', 'ever', 'mask', 'away', 'mistress', 'improvisation', 'care', 'everyone', 'everything', 'own', 'sweet', 'are', 'extras', 'kind', 'DVD', 'actually', 'good', 'thing', 'sort', 'film', 'should', 'really', 'stand', 'own', 'look', 'curtain', 'perfect', 'sense', 'are', 'not', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Even', 'trailer', 'might', 'give', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'game', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'great', 'film', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'late', 'night', 'viewing']",Last Seduction VHS

It is absolutely unbelievable that this title is not available on DVD, especially considering the fact that John Dahl's (the director) other two neo-noirs ARE on DVD--Kill Me Again and Red Rock West, both of which are also excellent.Unlike Body Heat, in which Lawrence Kasdan (director) formulaically uses film noir elements to tell a tale that grows increasingly more boring and tiresome, Dahl here does a brilliant job of weaving together elements of film noir in a completely fresh, intriguing, and powerful way. Yes, the femme fatale is here, but she's REALLY sexy and REALLY dangerous. And this HAS to be Linda Fiorentino's best performance ever. She is perfect for the part of Wendy, right on target.Bill Pullman strikes the perfect note as the sleazy, half-whiny, conniving husband and Peter Berg is also perfect as the seemingly not-so-dumb hick from upstate New York--who's ultimately shown to be, in fact, astoundingly dumb in a revelatory scene.

374896,ANP3R2R4V4GAN,630344315X,Omni,"[5, 9]","I can't say enough about this film.It is my favorite.  It such a favorite film that when I came to new Yok and didn't have a ""drink"" when going to bars, I ordered a Manhattan like Bridgitte and to this day I still drink it.What make sthsi film so good to me is one, she's smart and two she doesn't pull back.  It would've been easy to have her chicken out and go good girl at the end.  But Bridgitte has her eyes on teh prize from beginning to end.  Whether you consider her the Devil or a tarnished angel she doesn't stop.Also she thinks.Its so wonderful to see someone sit down and have to figure out a problem, to have to plot a manipulation, to leap at opportunities that may mean nothing and MAKE them mean something.I like the fact that she plays every card in teh deck: sex, homophobia, lust, race, anything it takes to in a sense stay alive.Now this may seem liek a throughly evil person but there points in this film where Bridgitte does ""crack"" or try to really be herself.  There's teh one where Mike asks who she is, what she's doing and she tries to explain to him abotu her husband and the money while playing pool.  He doesn't take her seriously.  For two reasons, he doesn't think she's that smart or capable and he can't fathom himself doin git either.  One thing I'v elearned is that the smarter you see yourself.  The more capable you feel about yourself the easier it is to understand others even if their goals and methods are opposed to your own.  It takes smarts to see smarts.There's also the point where Bridgitte has been forced to fake the accident with the private investigator. Before she leaves and is caught, she tries to have Mike comfort her, to really listen to her.  But two things have happned.  She's playe dtehgame so well that her sincerity comes across as false and two, he doesn't want someone without secrets.  Who doesn't have the upper hand.  Some people are drawn to being destroyed by others because it validates their existence.  If someone would take the time to destroy you it means that you exist, that you have meaning.  But Bridgitte does crack here, she's ready to fess up and be with Mike as an equal and he blows her off to play hockey.  Her voice even cracks and in some ways we can see how Bridgitte is the way she is because no one is a race horse like she is.  That she is tougher because the disappointment of others has made her tough to begin with.  That honest emotion I can relate to and it's why I like Bridgitte.  If she was just uncaringly evil, she'd be no fun but you understand why Bridgitte is the way she is if you look at when she lets her defenses down.Above ll else she is teh concummate chess player, understanding that the game is never to the pieces your playing with but to destroying the other side.  Being cut off from runnign because of her husband's debts and her desire NOT to run has boxed her in into not so much fighting in the way that men or women perceive fighting btu teh way thinkers do.  A thinker knows that everythign and everybody is a weapon or a defense in a fight.  That each word is a calculation, that each action should mean or be about something and seeing that ability on screen is what makes thsi film on my top 3 favorite films of my entire life.

The latter demonstrating a megacity,hyper-competitive, largely-experienced, jaded, cerebral, cynicalstate of mind, in this particular case, of Brooklyn, withprofits at any price, dog-eat-dog and  so on. She combine thosetalents with her capacity to inflame Berg with her femininityspontaneously.The visual aspects work well, for this particular movie, as aclassic style is exhibited by Fiorentino's character time andagain, such as by her gold watch, classic but provocativeclothes, with a few naked shots to boot, of both Berg andherself, emphasizing the over-extended libido felt by bothcharacters, at the same time as one their devious plans.The criminal tendencies of Fiorentino's character aredemonstrated at the same time as her lack of rigor in her ownpersonal conduct: throwing off her wedding ring, spittingchewing gum on the street, licking a dollar bill, using a men'swashroom (not the women's), spontaneously having relationsanywhere (outside a club, in a car, on her office desk), usingprofanity, reaching for private parts, spitting out her food,extinguishing a cigarette on  a pie, etc.) The character is alsoshown as having no notion of ethics, or of the policy ofconfidentiality touching upon client lists of her employer, asshe dreams up ways of making millions off life insurancepolicies she will manipulate.From the above discussion, the movie is a success story in termsof style, with a tiny bit of voyeurism, for those appreciatingthe actress' classic beauty (looks, clothes, etc.) and apparentdown to earth present, yet sophistication, as compared to whatis the norm in the media.While not a wide-screen release, the filming is spotless, themusic accompaniment is rooted in jazz, the story extremely wellarticulated, and relevant to today.

That it subsequently wound up on any list of the thousand-best films ever made is astonishing. That it ended up on four of the ten lists of this type of whose existence I am currently aware is the stuff of Hollywood legend.It's about Bridget Gregory (Linda Fiorentino, recently of Liberty Stands Still), a nasty sort who first ruins her husband's life, then heads off into the sunset, landing by chance in the tiny town of Beston, New York. In Beston, she hopes to lay low until her divorce is final, but two things prevent that from happening. One is that her husband would like the $700,000 she stole from him back, and hires a private investigator (Bill Nunn, from the Spider-Man franchise) to track her down. The other is her own nature; she can't exist somewhere without conning someone. So she gets involved with a local guy, Mike Swale (Smokin' Aces' Peter Berg), using the insurance company they both work for to look for women who might be better off with their husbands six feet underground.I have to say that five minutes into this, I didn't think I was going to like it. The opening is far too slow-paced and talky, especially for a scene that exists simply to set up the main conflict in the movie. It could've been done in half the time. Once the movie actually gets going, though, it's a great deal of fun. Fiorentino owns this character; it's widely believe that, had the movie not shown on HBO before getting a theatrical release, Fiorentino would have nabbed an Oscar nomination for Best Actress.  And while it takes some time for all the pieces of the plot to get set up, once it starts rolling, it's got momentum to spare. (Fans of The Usual Suspects will recognize the plot structure here, I'm sure.) I still don't think it's Dahl's best work-- Rounders is pretty tough to beat-- but it's certainly much better than its initial lack of distribution would convey. ***",4,"Fun, cheesy neo-noir.",1206403200,"03 25, 2008",2008,2058,"['Last', 'Seduction', 'John', 'Dahl', '1994', 'John', 'Dahl', 'made-for-cable', 'flick', 'Last', 'Seduction', 'ever', 'got', 'theatrical', 'release', 'cable', 'debut', 'pretty', 'remarkable', 'subsequently', 'wound', 'up', 'list', 'thousand-best', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'astonishing', 'ended', 'up', 'four', 'ten', 'lists', 'type', 'existence', 'am', 'currently', 'aware', 'stuff', 'Hollywood', 'legend.It', 'Bridget', 'Gregory', 'Linda', 'Fiorentino', 'recently', 'Liberty', 'Stands', 'Still', 'nasty', 'sort', 'who', 'first', 'husband', 'life', 'then', 'sunset', 'landing', 'chance', 'tiny', 'town', 'Beston', 'New', 'York', 'Beston', 'lay', 'low', 'divorce', 'final', 'two', 'things', 'prevent', 'happening', 'One', 'husband', 'would', 'like', '700,000', 'stole', 'back', 'private', 'investigator', 'Bill', 'Nunn', 'Spider-Man', 'franchise', 'track', 'down', 'other', 'own', 'nature', 'ca', ""n't"", 'exist', 'somewhere', 'conning', 'someone', 'involved', 'local', 'guy', 'Mike', 'Swale', 'Smokin', 'Aces', 'Peter', 'Berg', 'using', 'insurance', 'company', 'work', 'look', 'women', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'better', 'husbands', 'six', 'feet', 'underground.I', 'have', 'say', 'five', 'minutes', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'going', 'like', 'opening', 'far', 'too', 'slow-paced', 'talky', 'especially', 'scene', 'simply', 'set', 'up', 'main', 'conflict', 'movie', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'done', 'time', 'Once', 'movie', 'actually', 'going', 'though', 'great', 'deal', 'fun', 'Fiorentino', 'character', 'widely', 'believe', 'had', 'movie', 'not', 'shown', 'HBO', 'getting', 'theatrical', 'release', 'Fiorentino', 'would', 'have', 'nabbed', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Actress', 'time', 'pieces', 'plot', 'get', 'set', 'up', 'rolling', 'got', 'momentum', 'spare', 'Fans', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'will', 'recognize', 'plot', 'structure', 'here', ""'m"", 'sure', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Dahl', 'best', 'work', 'Rounders', 'pretty', 'tough', 'beat', 'certainly', 'much', 'better', 'initial', 'lack', 'distribution', 'would', 'convey', '***']",Last Seduction VHS

""Wendy"" as she's now called has plans for him and her ex that will allow her to keep all the money for herself.A direct descendant of ""Double Indemnity"" (Bridget gives her name as ""Mrs. Neff"" at one point a tip of the hat to the classic movie and book)and other noir thrillers, ""The Last Seduction"" got dumped on cable but when the distributor realized it had such a great movie they released it to theaters. Widely lauded for her role, Linda Fiorentino could have scored an Oscar nomination--if not for the fact that HBO showed this before it was released to theaters. Bill Pullman turns in a twisted performance as Clay playing with the audience expectations created by his appearence in other movies as the good guy. He gives a great performance. There's hardly a weak performance in the film and Dahl's direction is so sure handed you'd imagine this was his tenth or twentieth film not one of his first. The late great J.T. Walsh brings the oily lawyer Frank Griffith to life in a great supporting turn.That was the good news. The bad is that this great movie has been given a basic DVD presentation and, what's worse, it doesn't look all that great. There's a number of compression artifacts. While this states that it's in the original format, it looks to me like the image was blown up from a widescreen presentation as the image looks lousy. There's no extras at all. That's too bad as this film (like ""Red Rock West"") deserves a commentary track from Dahl as its one of his most accomplished films. At the very least, we should have gotten a documentary on the film and why it got dumped on cable and how the film was discovered by filmgoers.5 Stars for the movie, 2 stars for the lousy presentation by Artisan (and the lousy transfer). It's unfortunate that Lion's Gate (which distributes this) chose not to provide the package and picture quality this film deserved.",5,"Classic movie, not so classy presentation weak DVD needs to be remaster 5 star film, 2 star DVD presentation",1107820800,"02 8, 2005",2005,2762,"['John', 'Dahl', 'Last', 'Seduction', 'flavor', 'film', 'noir', 'perfectly', 'Bridgett', 'Linda', 'Fiorentino', 'have', 'beautiful', 'bright', 'married', 'dead', 'end', 'job', 'dead', 'beat', 'wannabe', 'doctor', 'Clay', 'Bill', 'Pullman', 'Clay', 'pulled', 'ultimate', 'drug', 'deal', 'illegally', 'purchased', 'medications', 'cocaine', 'sold', 'drug', 'dealers', 'street', 'do', 'borrowed', '100,000', 'loan', 'shark', 'profits', 'living', 'high', 'style', 'wife', 'Bridget', 'other', 'plans', 'fight', 'money', 'intention', 'keeping', 'herself', 'small', 'town', 'hoping', 'hold', 'money', 'attorney', 'J.', 'T.', 'Walsh', 'can', 'complete', 'divorce', 'Changing', 'name', 'job', 'insurance', 'company', 'Mike', 'Swale', 'Peter', 'Berg', 'local', 'bar', 'infatuated', 'moment', 'Wendy', 'now', 'called', 'plans', 'ex', 'will', 'allow', 'keep', 'money', 'herself.A', 'direct', 'descendant', 'Double', 'Indemnity', 'Bridget', 'name', 'Mrs.', 'Neff', 'one', 'point', 'tip', 'hat', 'classic', 'movie', 'book', 'other', 'noir', 'thrillers', 'Last', 'Seduction', 'got', 'dumped', 'cable', 'when', 'distributor', 'realized', 'had', 'such', 'great', 'movie', 'released', 'theaters', 'Widely', 'lauded', 'role', 'Linda', 'Fiorentino', 'could', 'have', 'scored', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'not', 'fact', 'HBO', 'showed', 'was', 'released', 'theaters', 'Bill', 'Pullman', 'twisted', 'performance', 'Clay', 'playing', 'audience', 'expectations', 'created', 'appearence', 'other', 'movies', 'good', 'guy', 'great', 'performance', 'hardly', 'weak', 'performance', 'film', 'Dahl', 'direction', 'so', 'sure', 'handed', ""'d"", 'imagine', 'was', 'tenth', 'twentieth', 'film', 'not', 'one', 'first', 'late', 'great', 'J.T', 'Walsh', 'oily', 'lawyer', 'Frank', 'Griffith', 'life', 'great', 'supporting', 'was', 'good', 'news', 'bad', 'great', 'movie', 'been', 'given', 'basic', 'DVD', 'presentation', 'what', 'worse', ""n't"", 'look', 'great', 'number', 'compression', 'artifacts', 'original', 'format', 'image', 'was', 'blown', 'up', 'widescreen', 'presentation', 'image', 'lousy', 'extras', 'too', 'bad', 'film', 'Red', 'Rock', 'West', 'commentary', 'track', 'Dahl', 'one', 'most', 'accomplished', 'films', 'very', 'least', 'should', 'have', 'gotten', 'documentary', 'film', 'why', 'got', 'dumped', 'cable', 'how', 'film', 'was', 'discovered', 'filmgoers.5', 'Stars', 'movie', '2', 'stars', 'lousy', 'presentation', 'Artisan', 'lousy', 'transfer', 'unfortunate', 'Lion', 'Gate', 'chose', 'not', 'provide', 'package', 'picture', 'quality', 'film', 'deserved']",Last Seduction VHS

One day I decided to see it from the beginning, strictly on the talk that Linda Fiorentino does the femme fatale thing quite well in it. I was not displeased. You, like I had, will find yourself goin' &quot;I don't believe what this lady is saying and doing.&quot; A note: that rube, if you remember, pushed himself on her and she did give him plenty of opportunity to bail out (she told him many times that he did not really want to have more to do with her than the no strings attached quickies, but he was apparently on a mission of his own) but, he seemed to ask for the mystery and danger 'Wendy Kroy' was offering and, like all good noirs, when it was far too gone to pull out, he found himself unable to.
