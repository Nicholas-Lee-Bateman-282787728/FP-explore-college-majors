It ranks as one of the all time best in my opinion, even though it was an independant film with no famous actors.  I enjoy every scene, as well as the acting performances.  Especially from the lead actor, who I think adds a lot to the film.  There is some funny audio commentary about how his performance in the latter scenes were enhanced.  It may not have much appeal for kids (or it may) but I think every fan of Christmas movies will enjoy this.  It really captures the spirit of the season and makes me wish that I lived in Chicago during Christmas.",5,A holiday blessing,1130544000,"10 29, 2005",2005,688,"['first', 'saw', 'Lifetime', 'nineties', 'then', 'searched', 'video', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'was', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'kick', 'one', 'time', 'best', 'opinion', 'even', 'was', 'independant', 'film', 'famous', 'actors', 'enjoy', 'scene', 'as', 'well', 'acting', 'performances', 'Especially', 'lead', 'actor', 'who', 'think', 'lot', 'film', 'funny', 'audio', 'commentary', 'how', 'performance', 'latter', 'scenes', 'were', 'enhanced', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'much', 'appeal', 'kids', 'may', 'think', 'fan', 'Christmas', 'movies', 'will', 'enjoy', 'really', 'spirit', 'season', 'wish', 'lived', 'Chicago', 'Christmas']",Solstice/The Night Before Christmas
938411,A4ANXZM5HNXEC,B000B9WF1W,"M. Cataline ""Pet Lover""","[0, 0]","I truly enjoyed this Christmas Movie! All the characters were great!! The star of the movie, Michael Kelley was Exceptionally Good, and was very well casted in this movie!This Motion Picture gave me a very 'Good Feeling' about the Holiday Season, and was indeed a very uplifting movie! I loved the Christmas Background Scenery that was set in Chicago. I thought it was very clever how the main character 'Nick Allman' appeared to be mostly observing people at Christmas Time instead of truly joining in with them, but seemed very content, and pleased with his observation role, and what he was observing. It was a very touching movie indeed!The only thing that bothered me about this movie because of the fact that I was enjoying it so much, was that it seemed too short. Also the Audio was a bit soft during various parts of this movie. But, I enjoyed very much the character of 'Nick Allman' (immensely) because he seemed so very 'real' thanks to the very natural and believable acting of Michael Kelley.The Special Features that concerned the making of this movie were fun to watch too! Overall, this was a very Enjoyable Product! I am glad that I had decided to purchase it, and I surely will be watching it again very soon!!",5,Very Inspirational Christmas Movie!,1255046400,"10 9, 2009",2009,1229,"['truly', 'enjoyed', 'Christmas', 'Movie', 'characters', 'were', 'great', 'star', 'movie', 'Michael', 'Kelley', 'was', 'Exceptionally', 'Good', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'casted', 'movie', 'Motion', 'Picture', 'gave', 'very', ""'Good"", 'Feeling', 'Holiday', 'Season', 'was', 'indeed', 'very', 'uplifting', 'movie', 'loved', 'Christmas', 'Background', 'Scenery', 'was', 'set', 'Chicago', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'clever', 'how', 'main', 'character', 'Allman', 'appeared', 'be', 'mostly', 'observing', 'people', 'Christmas', 'Time', 'instead', 'truly', 'joining', 'seemed', 'very', 'content', 'pleased', 'observation', 'role', 'what', 'was', 'observing', 'was', 'very', 'touching', 'movie', 'indeed', 'only', 'thing', 'bothered', 'movie', 'fact', 'was', 'enjoying', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'seemed', 'too', 'short', 'Also', 'Audio', 'was', 'bit', 'soft', 'various', 'parts', 'movie', 'enjoyed', 'very', 'much', 'character', ""'Nick"", 'Allman', 'immensely', 'seemed', 'so', 'very', ""'real"", 'thanks', 'very', 'natural', 'believable', 'acting', 'Michael', 'Kelley.The', 'Special', 'Features', 'concerned', 'making', 'movie', 'were', 'fun', 'watch', 'too', 'Overall', 'was', 'very', 'Enjoyable', 'Product', 'am', 'glad', 'had', 'decided', 'purchase', 'surely', 'will', 'be', 'watching', 'again', 'very', 'soon']",Solstice/The Night Before Christmas
938412,A35Q0RBM3YNQNF,B000B9WF1W,M. Hill,"[1, 1]","The Night Before Christmas  is not a big budget production, it is a little film with a decidedly independent movie feel. Originally released in 1994, as an hour long (with commercials) film shown on Lifetime TV, the DVD was issued as an anniversary edition in 2004 with versions in standard and widescreen, along with extras. Unfortunately, it is a grainy copy and the sound is a bit muffled in spots, which is the reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5.The story is a quiet one more in tune with how most of us live our lives. There are no huge dramatic moments, no death, no job loss, no sudden wealth, just a series of small events and meaningful realizations. By the end the main character has refocused on what is important instead of looking at what he doesn't have, like his girlfriend or a raise. The essence of the holiday spirit is that it is intangible, it isn't about an armload of gifts, it is about family, friendship, enjoying life and helping othersThis movie isn't depressing, it is hopeful. No viewer will be brought to tears from an artificially created plot twist, this movie simply reminds us that the small gestures we make, often without even realizing it, can touch others deeply. It may seem like they've had no effect, because unlike a Hollywood movie, in real life we usually don't know the outcome of our small kindnesses. If you are looking for a movie off the beaten track, and not expecting the usual holiday fare this is a good one.",4,Christmas Eve Realizations,1258761600,"11 21, 2009",2009,1468,"['Night', 'Before', 'Christmas', 'not', 'big', 'budget', 'production', 'little', 'film', 'decidedly', 'independent', 'movie', 'feel', 'Originally', 'released', '1994', 'hour', 'long', 'commercials', 'film', 'shown', 'Lifetime', 'TV', 'DVD', 'was', 'issued', 'anniversary', 'edition', '2004', 'versions', 'standard', 'widescreen', 'extras', 'Unfortunately', 'grainy', 'copy', 'sound', 'bit', 'muffled', 'spots', 'reason', 'am', 'giving', '4', 'stars', 'instead', '5.The', 'story', 'quiet', 'one', 'more', 'tune', 'how', 'most', 'live', 'lives', 'are', 'huge', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'death', 'job', 'loss', 'sudden', 'wealth', 'just', 'series', 'small', 'events', 'meaningful', 'realizations', 'end', 'main', 'character', 'refocused', 'what', 'important', 'instead', 'looking', 'what', ""n't"", 'have', 'girlfriend', 'raise', 'essence', 'holiday', 'spirit', 'intangible', ""n't"", 'armload', 'gifts', 'family', 'friendship', 'enjoying', 'life', 'helping', 'othersThis', 'movie', ""n't"", 'depressing', 'hopeful', 'viewer', 'will', 'be', 'brought', 'tears', 'artificially', 'created', 'plot', 'twist', 'movie', 'simply', 'small', 'make', 'often', 'even', 'realizing', 'can', 'touch', 'others', 'deeply', 'may', 'seem', ""'ve"", 'had', 'effect', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'real', 'life', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'outcome', 'small', 'kindnesses', 'are', 'looking', 'movie', 'beaten', 'track', 'not', 'expecting', 'usual', 'holiday', 'fare', 'good', 'one']",Solstice/The Night Before Christmas

We kept asking each other when the interesting part would start; it didn't.  Even beautiful Chicago seemed gray and sad.  It basically shows a young man who ignored his family's invitation to spend Christmas Eve with them because ""they all talked at the same time and didn't listen"", hurting his mother's feelings by not even calling; whose flakey ex-girlfriend is insulted when he buys her a videotape of a film she liked; who walks about town looking at others who also don't seem to have a life, family traditions or values.
