But, whatever your age or tastes or patience, if you want simply a nice movie, you have one here.I enjoyed Matthew Broderick's narration. Broderick usually plays likable roles and is an underrated actor, I think. I've never seen him in a bad performance. Even though this story is an emotional one, I found little emotion in the film but that makes it intriguing in parts.Sometime past the halfway mark, I asked myself, ""What is the point of this story?"" There is a point, and there is more than what meets the eye to this. Those who have seen this film know what I mean. I'm making vague statements, but I don't want to give away anything.I enjoyed the 1940s look to this, appreciated Patricia Arquette's against-type role; appreciated the fact there were no villains in here and the profanity was low.

Finally, one day I stumbled upon it @ Amazon.com.  With great excitement I ordered it immediately, nor did it end up being unworthy of my anticipation.The film centers around the epoch of Richard Phillips Feynman's courtship of and marriage to his 1st wife, Arline.  As such, it also touches upon Feynman's ""vocation"" during World War II, which was being an active member of the Manhattan Project in Los Alamos, New Mexico.The book is mostly based on Feynman's book called WHAT DO YOU CARE WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK? [ISBN: 0393320928, also available @ Amazon.com].  The book is highly recommended for all persons who have an interest in viewing this movie.  There are also a few tidbits from SURELY YOU'RE JOKING MR. FEYNMAN [ISBN: 0393316041] and John Archibald Wheeler's GEONS, BLACK HOLES AND QUANTUM FOAM [ISBN: 0393319911].  Both of these latter books are highly recommended to the Feynman enthusiast as well.The story of Feynman's sublime and fervent love that he felt for his terminally ill wife is nothing short of inspiring. As the great physicist has for many years been one of my most admired personages, it is without embarrassment that I admit this to be one of the few films that has ever made me cry.  Even viewers who have never heard of this scientist would be hard-pressed not to be moved by this film.As a bonus, the film does a good job of incorporating on the margins Feynman's dad, little sister, Joan (who earned a Ph.D. in physics herself from Syracuse university), John Archibald Wheeler, Hans Bethe, a young Henry Bethe and Robert Oppenheimer.The handful of verbal over-lays are well-placed and do not get in the way of the film's symmetry.  Although Broderick has never been one of my favorite actors, he pulled off his portrayal of a young Feynman quite well (if you ignore the fact that his New York accent is a bit inconsistent).

187935,A2BFF8VPLP4DJ6,1572527102,glory be,"[0, 1]","I loved this movie!  ""Infinity"" is the story of a very young Richard Feynman and his love Arlene Greenbaum.  The couple bravely face Arlene's terminal illness and at the same time, Richard is at Los Alamos working on the Manhatten Project.The script was written by Patricia Broderick who also co-produced with her son, Matthew who starred and directed this sweet film.  Maybe it is the time, the 1930's and 40's that give this film such an innocent feel.  We see people in this movie who look like real people of that time.Richard lived to solve problems so knowing Arlene (played by Patricia Arquette) was dying and there was no solution to this problem, made him divert his attention to other things such as; could a person smell as well as a blood hound?  A coping mechanism.There is some science in this as well but it seems to enhance rather than bog down what is happening.  Richard explains neutrons to Arlene using olives and she seems to get it.  The numbers he throws around after the encounter with the man with the abacus seem to mystafy her but she seems pleased because he looks so happy.He is stoic when she dies which makes this more poingnant.  The success of the bomb and her death become too much for him to take in.  So, he reverts to his way of diverting his feelings by talking to a young boy and running an errand for a friend.  But it is here that he sees a red dress in a window reminding him of the first time he sees a similar dress with Arlene.  There on his face is all the heart break he feels--a very touching moment.Patricia Arquette is wonderful, funny, sweet and tragic in this role.  It would be difficult to imagine anyone else as Arlene.  Matthew is so sensative and portrays Feynman in such an understated way.  Less is definitely more and Matthew seems to understand this.  His tender direction can be felt throughout.",5,Love Story,1296172800,"01 28, 2011",2011,1857,"['loved', 'movie', 'Infinity', 'story', 'very', 'young', 'Richard', 'Feynman', 'love', 'Arlene', 'Greenbaum', 'couple', 'bravely', 'face', 'Arlene', 'terminal', 'illness', 'same', 'time', 'Richard', 'Los', 'Alamos', 'working', 'Manhatten', 'Project.The', 'script', 'was', 'written', 'Patricia', 'Broderick', 'who', 'also', 'co-produced', 'son', 'Matthew', 'who', 'starred', 'directed', 'sweet', 'film', 'Maybe', 'time', '1930', '40', 'give', 'film', 'innocent', 'feel', 'see', 'people', 'movie', 'who', 'look', 'real', 'people', 'time.Richard', 'lived', 'solve', 'problems', 'so', 'knowing', 'Arlene', 'played', 'Patricia', 'Arquette', 'was', 'dying', 'was', 'solution', 'problem', 'made', 'divert', 'attention', 'other', 'things', 'such', 'could', 'person', 'smell', 'as', 'well', 'blood', 'hound', 'coping', 'mechanism.There', 'science', 'as', 'well', 'enhance', 'rather', 'bog', 'down', 'what', 'happening', 'Richard', 'neutrons', 'Arlene', 'using', 'olives', 'get', 'numbers', 'around', 'encounter', 'man', 'abacus', 'seem', 'mystafy', 'pleased', 'so', 'happy.He', 'stoic', 'when', 'more', 'poingnant', 'success', 'bomb', 'death', 'become', 'too', 'much', 'take', 'So', 'way', 'diverting', 'feelings', 'talking', 'young', 'boy', 'running', 'errand', 'friend', 'here', 'red', 'dress', 'window', 'reminding', 'first', 'time', 'similar', 'dress', 'Arlene', 'face', 'heart', 'break', 'very', 'touching', 'moment.Patricia', 'Arquette', 'wonderful', 'funny', 'sweet', 'tragic', 'role', 'would', 'be', 'difficult', 'imagine', 'anyone', 'else', 'Arlene', 'Matthew', 'so', 'sensative', 'portrays', 'Feynman', 'such', 'understated', 'way', 'Less', 'definitely', 'more', 'Matthew', 'understand', 'tender', 'direction', 'can', 'be', 'felt']",N/A

He amazed me then.I didn't actually think about Dr. Feynman's life until I saw ""Infinity"" available.  Matthew Broderick, who both plays Feynman in the film and directs it.  According to Feynman, he thought of the time depicted in this film as a romance, but it was also time where everything changed in the country.The story begins with Feynman (Broderick) meeting Arlene Greenbaum (Arquette).  They fall in love during pre WWII times.  They're engaged when they learn that Arlene has TB.  Feynman takes his undergrad at MIT and later grad work at Princeton. When he's offered a job at Alamosa, NM to work on the bomb, he accepts so he and Arlene can be wed.  The story briefly touches physics and the development of the a-bomb.What the story really is about is coping with illness during different times.  Back then, doctors didn't want patients to know what their diagnoses were.  Families didn't want their children to marry if there were severe illnesses involved, either.  Aside from his scientific genius, what marked Feynman as extraordinary was that he worked so hard at his marriage and making his wife as happy as she could be.This quiet, overlooked film takes us back to a different time in this country's life.  Broderick did an excellent job of taking us back.
