The Netflix rating system told me I'd like it, and they were right! So much so that I'll probably buy it soon.The coming of age love story watches the goings-on of Reed Fish, a ""literal"" big fish in a small town who has a daily radio show he inherited from his dad. The slam dunk in this movie is Schuyler Fisk's performance and music. She's incredibly engaging. Her music is wonderful. Jay Baruchel, as the title character Reed, and Alexis Bledel, as his fianc&eacute;e, do an excellent job.Some reviewers trash this film for various perceived ills, but they are completely missing the humour and the point. Reed Fish is a big fish, pun intended, in this little town, and spends his days solving problems for his listeners and otherwise operating as a pillar of his community despite his youth - it's meant to be a little weird, I think. There are many moments where the movie laughs at itself for all these ""flaws"", which I'm sure were engineered in in part to mimic reality.

It isn't exclusively this kind of comedy, though, and is quite funny in an unoffensive way.Everyone has said just about all there is to say here about this flick; I'll be your friendly neighborhood creepy cinema critic and evaluate this movie on PURELY MOVIE MOTIVES alone.It is stunning with the beautiful little locations. I particularly liked the ""ZORSE"" which like Reed Fish is a genuine animal genuinely named ZORSE. It strikes me that Reed Fish likes this little encomium. The other actors besides Jay Baruchel--especially D.J. Qualls--are really excellent here in the great Northwest town of Mud Meadows.What works for me is the impossible, surreal Reed Fish himself. He has inherited his late father's local radio show, which the entire town needs like a drug PLUS that morning half-a-dozen cups of joe. What on earth is going on here?--and this gives the film a good zing, in my book.Also, the soundtrack is peppy and impressive. I loved it.What I want to know is why Jay Baruchel, who still looks like a 6-foot-tall 13-year-old, is doing all these leading man romance films. I guess he's not the first to pop in mind when contemplating the lead in a romance, but this guy resembles Jerry Lewis and by my count in this film, EVERY GIRL IN SIGHT LOVES HIM.Ah well, that isn't critique, it's me whining about the casting of this flick. It's fun and I would like to keep it on my future list of DVD selections I haven't bought yet.

I would have been happy with it grossing even 1 Million at the Box Office instead of the paltry $3,130 it ended up with in its entire Box Office run, which, to be fair, only lasted a couple of weeks and was only shown on one screen.It's a good thing Alexis Bledel was in this or I might have missed this great little film. I wasn't all that impressed by the trailer but thought it looked decent. However, being a huge fan of Gilmore Girls, I planned on seeing it anyway for Alexis. I'm really thankful I did. The whole cast is terrific. I especially loved Jay Baruchel in it. I've never been that impressed by him until now. He gives a really nice, natural, and charming performance.I'm just so disappointed that it didn't do better. Did they not even market it? It couldn't have been marketed very well that's for sure.

His listener-ship is comprised exclusively of the citizens of Mud Meadows, a small town discreetly nestled in the pine-encrusted mountains of Southern California (the movie was filmed in the scenic Big Bear area).  Although he's come to be known as ""The Voice of Mud Meadows"" for keeping the town folk apprised on issues of concern to the local community, Fish really isn't all that happy with his life.  He actually feels hemmed in by the restrictions of small town life and is beginning to have second thoughts about his impending marriage to a childhood friend, Kate (Alexis Bledel), whom he may be marrying more out of a sense of duty and obligation than out of genuine love or passion.  His life gets even more complicated when Jill (Schuyler Fisk), a girl he once had a crush on, returns to Mud Meadows for the summer, stirring up old feelings in him and making him question even more the level of his commitment to Kate.Based on a semi-autobiographical story by none other than Reed Fish himself, ""I'm Reed Fish"" is an utterly beguiling indie comedy, overflowing with sweet sentiment, rueful humor and outstanding performances by Baruchel, Fisk, Bledel, Victor Rasuk, Katey Sagal and Chris Parnell, well known from his work on ""Saturday Night Live.""  Not only are the characters themselves immensely charming and likable but their responses to the situations they find themselves in are believable and touching as well.  ""I`m Reed Fish,"" written by Fish and directed by Zackary Adler, is smart about the complexities of romantic relationships, and the movie is filled with any number of beautiful and lovely moments, the most transcendent being the one in which Jill (Fisk) literally lights up the screen with her musical performance at a local pub.  As a writer, Fish is scrupulously fair to the characters he`s created, avoiding the obvious temptation to paint Kate, in particular, as a fool or a harridan just so he can enhance Jill's virtues in the viewer's eyes.  This equanimity makes the protagonist's romantic dilemma all that much more compelling and empathetic for the audience caught up in the story.As lagniappe, the writer has placed the story in an offbeat film-within-a-film framework that gives the movie an extra added kick at the end.",4,charming indie comedy,1199232000,"01 2, 2008",2008,2381,"['Reed', 'Fish', 'Jay', 'Baruchel', 'radio', 'call-in', 'show', 'audience', 'loyal', 'spirit', 'infinitesimal', 'size', 'listener-ship', 'comprised', 'exclusively', 'citizens', 'Mud', 'Meadows', 'small', 'town', 'discreetly', 'nestled', 'pine-encrusted', 'mountains', 'Southern', 'California', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'scenic', 'Big', 'Bear', 'area', 'come', 'be', 'known', 'Voice', 'Mud', 'Meadows', 'keeping', 'town', 'folk', 'apprised', 'issues', 'concern', 'local', 'community', 'Fish', 'really', ""n't"", 'happy', 'life', 'actually', 'hemmed', 'restrictions', 'small', 'town', 'life', 'beginning', 'have', 'second', 'thoughts', 'impending', 'marriage', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Kate', 'Alexis', 'Bledel', 'whom', 'may', 'be', 'marrying', 'more', 'sense', 'duty', 'obligation', 'genuine', 'love', 'passion', 'life', 'even', 'more', 'complicated', 'when', 'Jill', 'Schuyler', 'Fisk', 'girl', 'once', 'had', 'crush', 'returns', 'Mud', 'Meadows', 'summer', 'stirring', 'up', 'old', 'feelings', 'making', 'question', 'even', 'more', 'level', 'commitment', 'Kate.Based', 'semi-autobiographical', 'story', 'none', 'other', 'Reed', 'Fish', ""'m"", 'Reed', 'Fish', 'utterly', 'beguiling', 'indie', 'comedy', 'overflowing', 'sweet', 'sentiment', 'rueful', 'humor', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'Baruchel', 'Fisk', 'Bledel', 'Victor', 'Rasuk', 'Katey', 'Sagal', 'Chris', 'Parnell', 'well', 'known', 'work', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'Not', 'only', 'are', 'characters', 'immensely', 'charming', 'likable', 'responses', 'situations', 'find', 'are', 'believable', 'touching', 'as', 'well', 'm', 'Reed', 'Fish', 'written', 'Fish', 'directed', 'Zackary', 'Adler', 'smart', 'complexities', 'romantic', 'relationships', 'movie', 'filled', 'number', 'beautiful', 'lovely', 'moments', 'most', 'transcendent', 'being', 'one', 'Jill', 'Fisk', 'literally', 'up', 'screen', 'musical', 'performance', 'local', 'pub', 'writer', 'Fish', 'scrupulously', 'fair', 'characters', 's', 'created', 'avoiding', 'obvious', 'temptation', 'paint', 'Kate', 'particular', 'fool', 'harridan', 'just', 'so', 'can', 'enhance', 'Jill', 'virtues', 'viewer', 'eyes', 'equanimity', 'protagonist', 'romantic', 'dilemma', 'that', 'much', 'more', 'compelling', 'empathetic', 'audience', 'caught', 'up', 'story.As', 'lagniappe', 'writer', 'placed', 'story', 'offbeat', 'film-within-a-film', 'framework', 'movie', 'extra', 'added', 'kick', 'end']",N/A

Aside from the two women (Alexis Bledel and Schuyler Fisk), the acting was awful/bland, and the plot was just really weird/lame. Throughout the story, you get to know the characters and see their relationships develop and then all of a sudden, you realize they were all just acting. At the end, two completely random people end up being the real Jill and Kate and I couldn't have cared less who he ended up with because they were both complete strangers with whom there had been no chemistry developed.It's really ridiculous to waste so much time building up everyone's relationships and chemistry like that only to extinguish it all in the end. I can tell the director was going for something unique and different here rather than just the predictable love story but honestly, a predictable love story would have been much better. IMO, this just didn't work out at all.Aside from the ridiculous plot twist, the main character was just not all that likeable. Jay's Reed was less the likeable guy and more the mumbling, moronic loser who I just couldn't like no matter how hard I tried. I wish neither woman had ended up with him in the end because he really wasn't worthy of any of them in any respect.The only decent part of the movie was when Schuyler Fisk sang at the bar. That was truly the only thing worth watching so please, don't waste your money on this one unless you really want to see her sing (Even then you might just want to fast forward to that part).",1,"Wow, this really sucked...(WARNING: spoiler alert if you care)",1217203200,"07 28, 2008",2008,1575,"['only', 'bought', 'movie', 'Alexis', 'Bledel', 'was', 'overall', 'have', 'say', ""'m"", 'very', 'disappointed', 'Aside', 'two', 'women', 'Alexis', 'Bledel', 'Schuyler', 'Fisk', 'acting', 'was', 'awful/bland', 'plot', 'was', 'just', 'really', 'weird/lame', 'story', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'see', 'relationships', 'develop', 'then', 'sudden', 'realize', 'were', 'just', 'acting', 'end', 'two', 'completely', 'random', 'people', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'real', 'Jill', 'Kate', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'cared', 'less', 'who', 'ended', 'up', 'were', 'complete', 'strangers', 'whom', 'had', 'been', 'no', 'chemistry', 'developed.It', 'really', 'ridiculous', 'waste', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'building', 'up', 'everyone', 'relationships', 'chemistry', 'only', 'extinguish', 'end', 'can', 'tell', 'director', 'was', 'going', 'something', 'unique', 'different', 'here', 'rather', 'just', 'predictable', 'love', 'story', 'honestly', 'predictable', 'love', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'IMO', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'all.Aside', 'ridiculous', 'plot', 'twist', 'main', 'character', 'was', 'just', 'not', 'likeable', 'Jay', 'Reed', 'was', 'less', 'likeable', 'guy', 'more', 'mumbling', 'moronic', 'loser', 'who', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'like', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'tried', 'wish', 'woman', 'had', 'ended', 'up', 'end', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'worthy', 'respect.The', 'only', 'decent', 'part', 'movie', 'was', 'when', 'Schuyler', 'Fisk', 'sang', 'bar', 'was', 'truly', 'only', 'thing', 'worth', 'watching', 'so', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'money', 'one', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'sing', 'Even', 'then', 'might', 'just', 'want', 'fast', 'forward', 'part']",N/A
