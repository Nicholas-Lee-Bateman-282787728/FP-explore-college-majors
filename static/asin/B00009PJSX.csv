Beyond great, really.  The Clash is foremost political and for those who haven't seen the videos for This Is Radio Clash or Rock the Casbah are truly missing out.Their sense of humor isn't lost on me either.  It comes out most in Rock the Casbah (again) in the bizarre centerpiece of the work, the dualistic imagery of two men dressed as a Rabbi and a Middle Easterner of some sort and their adventures together and apart, as the Clash play in front of an oil rig.  Certainly still relevant today.  I also can never get tired of the video for Bankrobber, with the goofy bank heist.  Very cute.Footage that I have never seen before of the Clash playing White Riot was amazing!  All the live performances not included on our old bootleg copy of This Is Video Clash were a welcome addition.Unfortunately, I felt somehow unfulfilled by the end of the videos-as if there weren't enough.  It is certainly possible that they included all they could and aren't holding out on us.  Based on past acts of integrity on the part of the Clash, let's assume so.I have to take exception, however, to other reviewers who appreciated Joe Strummer's short film.  I think the film serves one single purpose: To show that making a movie is a difficult task.  First, it is way too long.  The plot was relatively thin and the story could have been pithily told in about ten minutes.  Second, and this could be my problem, not Joe Strummer's, it was really hard to follow.  It is certainly possible that as a member of the generation apparently raised by television that my attention span is worn to a nub, but I think due in part to the sometimes poor camera work, the poor quality of the film, and the fact that it was a silent film, it was intrinsically hard to follow.  And finally, the silence was compensated for by an unrelated string of Clash songs that I have to believe were inserted later, possibly because the film itself was even harder to follow without the music.  Some of the songs, in fact seemed to be hastily chosen, as instrumental tracks, the lyrics simply omitted.  The soundtrack seemed, to say the least, extremely sloppy.However, this collection is ESSENTIAL even for the most casual Clash fan.  The videos aren't played very much on television, so this $20 investment is certainly a worthwhile one.  Just skip the movie.",5,Truly...essential.,1073174400,"01 4, 2004",2004,2458,"['gave', 'DVD', 'collection', 'five', 'stars', 'because-well', 'Clash', 'videos', 'are', 'great', 'music', 'course', 'great', 'Beyond', 'great', 'really', 'Clash', 'foremost', 'political', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'videos', 'Radio', 'Clash', 'Rock', 'Casbah', 'are', 'truly', 'missing', 'sense', 'humor', ""n't"", 'lost', 'out', 'most', 'Rock', 'Casbah', 'again', 'bizarre', 'centerpiece', 'work', 'dualistic', 'imagery', 'two', 'men', 'dressed', 'Rabbi', 'Middle', 'Easterner', 'sort', 'adventures', 'together', 'apart', 'Clash', 'play', 'front', 'oil', 'rig', 'Certainly', 'still', 'relevant', 'today', 'also', 'can', 'never', 'get', 'tired', 'video', 'Bankrobber', 'goofy', 'bank', 'heist', 'Very', 'cute.Footage', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'Clash', 'playing', 'White', 'Riot', 'was', 'amazing', 'live', 'performances', 'not', 'included', 'old', 'bootleg', 'copy', 'Is', 'Video', 'Clash', 'were', 'welcome', 'addition.Unfortunately', 'felt', 'somehow', 'unfulfilled', 'end', 'videos-as', 'were', ""n't"", 'enough', 'certainly', 'possible', 'included', 'could', 'are', ""n't"", 'holding', 'out', 'Based', 'past', 'acts', 'integrity', 'part', 'Clash', 'let', 'assume', 'so.I', 'have', 'take', 'exception', 'however', 'other', 'reviewers', 'who', 'appreciated', 'Joe', 'Strummer', 'short', 'film', 'think', 'film', 'one', 'single', 'purpose', 'show', 'making', 'movie', 'difficult', 'task', 'First', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'plot', 'was', 'relatively', 'thin', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'pithily', 'told', 'about', 'ten', 'minutes', 'Second', 'could', 'be', 'problem', 'not', 'Joe', 'Strummer', 'was', 'really', 'hard', 'follow', 'certainly', 'possible', 'member', 'generation', 'apparently', 'raised', 'television', 'attention', 'span', 'worn', 'nub', 'think', 'due', 'part', 'sometimes', 'poor', 'camera', 'work', 'poor', 'quality', 'film', 'fact', 'was', 'silent', 'film', 'was', 'intrinsically', 'hard', 'follow', 'finally', 'silence', 'was', 'compensated', 'unrelated', 'string', 'Clash', 'songs', 'have', 'believe', 'were', 'inserted', 'later', 'possibly', 'film', 'was', 'even', 'harder', 'follow', 'music', 'songs', 'fact', 'seemed', 'be', 'hastily', 'chosen', 'instrumental', 'tracks', 'lyrics', 'simply', 'omitted', 'soundtrack', 'seemed', 'say', 'least', 'extremely', 'sloppy.However', 'collection', 'ESSENTIAL', 'even', 'most', 'casual', 'Clash', 'fan', 'videos', 'are', ""n't"", 'played', 'very', 'much', 'television', '20', 'investment', 'certainly', 'worthwhile', 'one', 'Just', 'skip', 'movie']",N/A
756214,A1ZQV5I67LZV2K,B00009PJSX,Michael S. Mahoney,"[25, 37]","Pity The Clash couldn't have picked on Pink Floyd instead.  Here in the infancy of video the maestros of the Westway prove their live supremacy.  ""Tommy Gun"" is riveting.  Strummer, wearing a t-shirt designed to niggle the British government, displays some suspect dental work.  Meanwhile Mick Jones strangles his fret board and teases out single bullet shots.  Even when losing their way in ""Clampdown"" they're exciting.  A good deal of the footage was shot in New York, including ""The Radio Clash"" which features the white men in funkensmith palais.  Clearly enjoying himself, Joe hoists a massive jam box and the band lines up for a memorable cats on a fence dance (they were always about input, about soaking up the local atmosphere).  And yes, they could be incredibly silly.  At times they look like boy scouts on jamboree, complete with berets, and the unearthed black and white film needs reinterring.  Suffice to say Strummer was a better songwriter than filmmaker.  The extras bit, a real highlight of the disc, presents The Clash in all their lean fury.  While playing pool, Jones describes the moment of conception - cut to the band alone in a warehouse, guitars at the ready.  They ignite into ""1977"" like amphetimined sinew jammed in a jar, set to explode.
