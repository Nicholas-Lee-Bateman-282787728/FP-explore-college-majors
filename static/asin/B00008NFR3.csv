745423,A1YC9XEDFKXPLK,B00008NFR3,Armando M. Mesa,"[16, 16]","This is one of the most powerfully charged psychological thrillers that I have seen in recent years ! The Unsaid is sheer brilliance with an ensemble of talented actors I have never heard of before except for the underrated and superbly gifted Andy Garcia. This film has to definitely tug on some emotions from any viewer...The Unsaid shows the beauty and compassion of one human being trying to reach out to another in desperate need and at the same time the flipside of the darkest corners of the human soul and fragmented psyche. One taboo subject in particular is at the heart of the subplot or twist !Garcia portrays a psychologist/therapist who grieves over the suicide of his son in painful silence. A few years later he reluctantly takes on a case to help another boy in dire need of therapy after his mother was killed by his father. He takes the case after the urgence and insistance of one of his former students who is now a case/social worker. The social worker strongly feels that Tommy is not ready to be released into the real world for she fears the worst; Tommy is hiding much pain and anger. Also, to what lengths will Tommy go to to be released from the boys' center he had been placed in ? Soon, into the story the viewer begins to question who is actually helping or manipulating who as you will find out that Garcia's character is also in need of therapy and counseling ...However, I was able to pickup and guess exactly what the horrifying secret was that Tommy had buried or wiped out of his mind (there are subtle clues). Does this make The Unsaid predictable? Not in the least because even if the viewer figures out what it is before it is actually revealed, the film has so much going for it that it won't matter...Need I mention that the acting is stupendous from the main characters !It is a great pity that this film was not released into  &quot;Hollywood&quot; mainstream theatrical release. But, then again, The Unsaid is anything BUT mainstream. It is pretty cerebral and emotional. As a guy I am not ashmaed to say that a few scenes put a few lumps in my throat (so, I got veklepmft in my schinetezoid, big woop)...The main thing is is that this is one I highly recommended to my friends and family. It is there currently in any good video and reputable video store...However, since it is a limited release sleeper you may only find VHS copies as I did as most video rental places I went to did not order or put out the dvd versions (what else is new when you gotta make room for the popular mainstream titles)...",5,The Great One That Got Away From Major Theatrical Release,1069286400,"11 20, 2003",2003,2548,"['one', 'most', 'powerfully', 'charged', 'psychological', 'thrillers', 'have', 'seen', 'recent', 'years', 'Unsaid', 'sheer', 'brilliance', 'ensemble', 'talented', 'actors', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'before', 'underrated', 'superbly', 'gifted', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'film', 'definitely', 'tug', 'emotions', 'viewer', 'Unsaid', 'beauty', 'compassion', 'one', 'human', 'being', 'trying', 'reach', 'out', 'desperate', 'need', 'same', 'time', 'flipside', 'darkest', 'corners', 'human', 'soul', 'fragmented', 'psyche', 'One', 'taboo', 'subject', 'particular', 'heart', 'subplot', 'twist', 'Garcia', 'psychologist/therapist', 'who', 'suicide', 'son', 'painful', 'silence', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'reluctantly', 'case', 'help', 'boy', 'dire', 'need', 'therapy', 'mother', 'was', 'killed', 'father', 'case', 'urgence', 'insistance', 'one', 'former', 'students', 'who', 'now', 'case/social', 'worker', 'social', 'worker', 'strongly', 'Tommy', 'not', 'ready', 'be', 'released', 'real', 'world', 'worst', 'Tommy', 'hiding', 'much', 'pain', 'anger', 'Also', 'what', 'lengths', 'will', 'Tommy', 'go', 'be', 'released', 'boys', 'center', 'had', 'been', 'placed', 'Soon', 'story', 'viewer', 'question', 'who', 'actually', 'helping', 'manipulating', 'who', 'will', 'find', 'out', 'Garcia', 'character', 'also', 'need', 'therapy', 'counseling', 'However', 'was', 'able', 'pickup', 'guess', 'exactly', 'what', 'horrifying', 'secret', 'was', 'Tommy', 'had', 'buried', 'wiped', 'mind', 'are', 'subtle', 'clues', 'make', 'Unsaid', 'predictable', 'Not', 'least', 'even', 'viewer', 'out', 'what', 'actually', 'revealed', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'wo', ""n't"", 'matter', 'Need', 'mention', 'acting', 'stupendous', 'main', 'characters', 'great', 'pity', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'released', 'quot', 'Hollywood', 'quot', 'theatrical', 'release', 'then', 'again', 'Unsaid', 'anything', 'BUT', 'mainstream', 'pretty', 'cerebral', 'emotional', 'guy', 'am', 'not', 'ashmaed', 'say', 'few', 'scenes', 'put', 'few', 'lumps', 'throat', 'so', 'got', 'veklepmft', 'schinetezoid', 'big', 'woop', 'main', 'thing', 'one', 'highly', 'recommended', 'friends', 'family', 'there', 'currently', 'good', 'video', 'reputable', 'video', 'store', 'However', 'limited', 'release', 'may', 'only', 'find', 'VHS', 'copies', 'did', 'most', 'video', 'rental', 'places', 'went', 'did', 'not', 'order', 'put', 'out', 'dvd', 'versions', 'what', 'else', 'new', 'when', 'got', 'ta', 'make', 'room', 'popular', 'mainstream', 'titles']",N/A

Psychology and the problems enhanced by its nature usually form the grounds of the plots of most American movies. This movie, is an addition. But, it goes beyond that state, by presenting a psychological quandary and developing on it until the end of the movie.To be more specific, Andy Garcia plays the therapist, who has lost his son recently by his suicide. One of his fellows asks for help in a case of one of her patients, Vincent Kartheiser who comes out to have an extraordinary past. Having sworn not to deal with anymore patients, Garcia still cannot refrain himself from seeing and helping him. The fact that Andy hasn't been able to forget the pain of his son's loss will make Andy's therapy of Vincent very special, because after some time with him, Vincent will reminisce Andy's own son.Moreover, in the course of the movie, what you think you know will be altered by the surprising revelations. Different pasts will merge with others. The movie will become a thrilling psychological tension. You definitely do not want to miss this movie, by any means.

745433,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00008NFR3,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[15, 17]","Relatively early on in ""The Unsaid,"" psychiatrist Michael Hunter (Andy Garcia) gives a lecture at his alma mater where he explains that sometimes a person experiences something so horrible that they make up a fake memory to cover it up.  Although Hunter is speaking to students and colleagues, we in the audience know that we should be taking notes as well and that this theory is a vital clue to unraveling the mystery of the movie.  The problem is that despite some feints in other directions, the clue is to be applied to the case of Thomas Caffey (Vincent Kartheiser), who is about to become of age and unless some body comes up with a good reason is about to be released from state care.What horrible crime did Thomas commit?  Nothing.  The story is that he came home and found that his father (Sam Bottoms) had murdered his mother (Sarah Deakins), and was traumatized by the experience.  Barbara Wagner (Teri Polo), a former student of Hunter's, persuades him to look at Thomas' case.  Hunter has not taken any clients in the three years since his son committed suicide and Thomas looks enough like his son to get things jumbled in the psychiatrist's mind.  This is dangerous and unethical, but this is movie so we are not concerned with such things.That is good, because Thomas becomes involved with Shelly Hunter (Linda Cardnellini), the psychiatrist's estranged daughter.  The death of his son destroyed his marriage, and in his pain and despair Hunter ignored his surviving child.  But putting his own house in order never occurs to Hunter and Thomas is able to get some information from Shelly that allows him to play his own games during the therapy sessions.  Now, this could be interesting, even though Thomas does not seem smart enough to really take advantage of it.  Thomas clearly has a dark secret and the clenched fist he keeps making when people say the wrong thing to him speaks to a potential for violence.  It is just a question of when he will explode.What sinks ""The Unsaid"" is both the setup for the big payoff and the big payoff itself.  One of the girls from Shelly's school is murdered and the police are sniffing around the facility Thomas is kept in.  Then there is Shelly's ex-boyfriend, who tends to get drunk and angry, especially when Thomas gets in the way.  You expect this bad blood to come to blows and it sort of does, but we do not really know.  If at the end of a film you cannot tell if the red herrings were red herrings or not, then there are some major problems.  But the fatal blow is when we find out (dramatic pause) the truth.  What was ""unsaid"" finally gets said, but we do not really get to hear it and when we find out the big dark secret I am perfectly willing to admit that I never saw this coming.  But, on the other hand, I would never want to see that coming.Garcia turns in a fine performance and works hard to keep everything together, but this screenplay really does not play fair with the audience.  Not only does Thomas have something that is unsaid with regards to the death of his mother, so does Hunter in terms of the suicide of his son.  This is really fool me twice territory, and really underscores that this psychiatrist should not be seeing this patient.  Again, I might forgive such dramatic manipulations if the payoff was worth it, but beyond the sheer shock value I do not think that it was and it cheapens the entire film.",3,A flawed script that derails Andy Garcia's fine performance,1103500800,"12 20, 2004",2004,3400,"['Relatively', 'early', 'Unsaid', 'psychiatrist', 'Michael', 'Hunter', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'lecture', 'alma', 'mater', 'where', 'sometimes', 'person', 'something', 'so', 'horrible', 'make', 'up', 'fake', 'memory', 'cover', 'up', 'Hunter', 'speaking', 'students', 'colleagues', 'audience', 'know', 'should', 'be', 'taking', 'notes', 'well', 'theory', 'vital', 'clue', 'unraveling', 'mystery', 'movie', 'problem', 'feints', 'other', 'directions', 'clue', 'be', 'applied', 'case', 'Thomas', 'Caffey', 'Vincent', 'Kartheiser', 'who', 'become', 'age', 'body', 'up', 'good', 'reason', 'be', 'released', 'state', 'care.What', 'horrible', 'crime', 'did', 'Thomas', 'commit', 'Nothing', 'story', 'came', 'home', 'found', 'father', 'Sam', 'Bottoms', 'had', 'murdered', 'mother', 'Sarah', 'Deakins', 'was', 'traumatized', 'experience', 'Barbara', 'Wagner', 'Teri', 'Polo', 'former', 'student', 'Hunter', 'look', 'Thomas', 'case', 'Hunter', 'not', 'taken', 'clients', 'three', 'years', 'son', 'committed', 'suicide', 'Thomas', 'enough', 'son', 'get', 'things', 'jumbled', 'psychiatrist', 'mind', 'dangerous', 'unethical', 'movie', 'are', 'not', 'concerned', 'such', 'things.That', 'good', 'Thomas', 'involved', 'Shelly', 'Hunter', 'Linda', 'Cardnellini', 'psychiatrist', 'estranged', 'daughter', 'death', 'son', 'destroyed', 'marriage', 'pain', 'despair', 'Hunter', 'ignored', 'surviving', 'child', 'putting', 'own', 'house', 'order', 'never', 'Hunter', 'Thomas', 'able', 'get', 'information', 'Shelly', 'play', 'own', 'games', 'therapy', 'sessions', 'Now', 'could', 'be', 'interesting', 'even', 'Thomas', 'not', 'seem', 'smart', 'enough', 'really', 'take', 'advantage', 'Thomas', 'clearly', 'dark', 'secret', 'clenched', 'fist', 'making', 'when', 'people', 'say', 'wrong', 'thing', 'speaks', 'potential', 'violence', 'just', 'question', 'when', 'will', 'explode.What', 'sinks', 'Unsaid', 'setup', 'big', 'payoff', 'big', 'payoff', 'One', 'girls', 'Shelly', 'school', 'murdered', 'police', 'are', 'sniffing', 'facility', 'Thomas', 'kept', 'Then', 'Shelly', 'ex-boyfriend', 'who', 'get', 'drunk', 'angry', 'especially', 'when', 'Thomas', 'way', 'expect', 'bad', 'blood', 'come', 'blows', 'sort', 'do', 'not', 'really', 'know', 'end', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'tell', 'red', 'herrings', 'were', 'red', 'herrings', 'not', 'then', 'are', 'major', 'problems', 'fatal', 'blow', 'when', 'find', 'out', 'dramatic', 'pause', 'truth', 'What', 'was', 'unsaid', 'finally', 'said', 'do', 'not', 'really', 'get', 'hear', 'when', 'find', 'out', 'big', 'dark', 'secret', 'am', 'perfectly', 'willing', 'admit', 'never', 'saw', 'coming', 'other', 'hand', 'would', 'never', 'want', 'see', 'coming.Garcia', 'fine', 'performance', 'hard', 'keep', 'everything', 'together', 'screenplay', 'really', 'not', 'play', 'fair', 'audience', 'Not', 'only', 'Thomas', 'have', 'something', 'unsaid', 'regards', 'death', 'mother', 'so', 'Hunter', 'terms', 'suicide', 'son', 'really', 'fool', 'twice', 'territory', 'really', 'psychiatrist', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'seeing', 'patient', 'Again', 'might', 'forgive', 'such', 'dramatic', 'manipulations', 'payoff', 'was', 'worth', 'sheer', 'shock', 'value', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'was', 'entire', 'film']",N/A

Andy Garcia and Al Pacino are two that come to mind. Both seem to work with their supporting cast to bring out the best in them. This is definitely the case in ""The Unsaid"" and it's wonderful to watch talented actors working together to make an entertaining movie. The movie has no shallow parts and deals with the subject of a child's suicide and the aftermath realistically. Sometimes it's hard to watch because you deeply feel the pain of the father played by Andy Garcia. It  shows how suicide tears the family structure apart. The remaining sibling feels neglected by her father and each family member feels responsible for the death in some way. The father is a psychologist but cannot deal with his own pain. In this frame of mind, he starts treating a patient  that has experienced the murder of his mother that is the same age as his dead son. Two wounded souls are given an opportunity to either face the truth and start healing or repress the truth and destroy themselves. Both have secrets and shame they are hiding.

Wood ""Content Writer and Reviewer""","[6, 6]","Michael Hunter (Andy Garcia) is a brilliant child psychologist / professor who is well respected in his field by his colleagues and his students. Problem is he never expects the suicide of his son. This tragic event rips his family apart sending them all in different directions.Many years later, after a speaking event for his latest book, a former student approaches him with a case she's been working on. A young man who witnessed his mother's murder by his father when he was younger is about to turn eighteen and potentially be released into the public if approved. After some corroding Hunter agrees to see him.Hunter is instantly taken with the young Tommy Caffey (Vincent Kartheiser) because of his soft personable demeanour and quick wit. Something about him reminds him of his son. After his visit he agrees to continue seeing Tommy but not treating him. More and more Tommy is meshes with Hunter's memories of his son and soon the lines become blurred.Things aren't as they seem as both sides are hiding their true selves from themselves and everyone else. As the meetings continue Tommy becomes more and more afraid that Hunter is not going to recommend him for release and develops a plan to throw the doctor off his game.I really liked this film. Kartheiser is definitely a scene stealer with those poetic eyes that switch from teary to deadly in a heart beat. Garcia is what Garcia does. His dialogue is believable and his heartache palpable. After Tommy's gut reaction at a train station rave where he has a run in with a young woman who wants more than he give the storyline was pretty much predictable but the cast was able to keep it interesting. Definitely worth watching. I will watch it again.Reviewed by M. E.

He plays a psychiatrist whose sixteen year old son commits suicide.  The opening sequence leading to this is extremely well done, with a disturbing sense of loss and hopelessness captured in Garcia's performance.  Three years later, Garcia has grown a beard, lost his wife and daughter, and has given up treating patients.  He is asked by former student Teri Polo to look at a young man who is about to be released from a home for disturbed boys.  Is he ready to come out into society?  Vincent Kartheiser is excellent as the young boy, who witnessed the murder of his mother by his father while a little boy.  Inevitably, Vincent becomes involved with Garcia's estranged daughter (Linda Cardellini), and we find out that nothing is quite as it seems.  Initially vague about the reason for Kyle's suicide, we find out later the tragic event which led up to this suicide, and we also learn much more about the murder of Kartheiser's mother.One plot hole that hurts:  what happened to Troy, Shelley's brutish boyfriend.

Very, very bad. Still, I was overly fond of Andy Garcia (before he got mixed up with Steven Soderbergh, anyway), so I had to see this movie. Which is ""in the tradition of Primal Fear"", according to the box. Ay caramba.Garcia plays Michael Hunter, a therapist who goes into early retirement after the suicide of his son and the breakup of his family, coming into public only for the odd lecture now and then. After one of them, he is approached by Barbara Wagner (Teri Polo of The West Wing), a former student of his now a caseworker, and asks him to look over the case of a teenage boy who has everyone but her fooled. You know where this is going, right?To its credit, I did see a few places where it looked as if it were going to veer off into the territory of slick, complex psychological thriller. It manages to avoid doing so, however, at every turn. The film makes regular reference to Thomas (Angel's Vincent Kartheiser) resembling Hunter's son Kyle, and at one point, it looks as if Thomas is going to try and play on that. There's one reference...and then that entire line of thinking disappears from the script. It's as if they tried to do it one way, decided to do it another way, didn't quite get everything revised out of the script from the first way, and then failed to catch the error. At least, I hope that's the case; if it was actually meant to come off like this, screenwriter Miguel Tejada-Flores' heart wasn't really in it. (After checking his recent credits, which include such timeless fare as Darkness and Rottweiler, however, I find I could also be incorrect in that. He could, really, just be that bad.)There is a rule I have with ""In the tradition of..."" films most of the time: you're better off watching the movie that the coattail-riding dog is in the tradition of. In this case, the rule holds up. Maybe even better than most times. Garcia isn't enough to save this one. There's some serious eye candy in the triple-threat of Polo, a young Linda Cardellini, and Chelsea Field, but that's about it. * ",2,Bleah.,1183593600,"07 5, 2007",2007,2295,"['Unsaid', 'Tom', 'McLoughlin', '2001', 'Here', 'rule', 'thumb', 'time', 'description', 'piece', 'media', 'be', 'book', 'movie', 'radio', 'program', 'scribble', 'what', 'have', 'words', 'tradition', 'piece', 'media', 'going', 'be', 'bad', 'Very', 'very', 'bad', 'Still', 'was', 'overly', 'fond', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'got', 'mixed', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'anyway', 'so', 'had', 'see', 'movie', 'Which', 'tradition', 'Primal', 'Fear', 'according', 'box', 'Ay', 'caramba.Garcia', 'Michael', 'Hunter', 'therapist', 'who', 'early', 'retirement', 'suicide', 'son', 'breakup', 'family', 'coming', 'public', 'only', 'odd', 'lecture', 'now', 'then', 'one', 'approached', 'Barbara', 'Wagner', 'Teri', 'Polo', 'West', 'Wing', 'former', 'student', 'now', 'caseworker', 'look', 'case', 'teenage', 'boy', 'who', 'everyone', 'fooled', 'know', 'where', 'going', 'right', 'credit', 'did', 'see', 'few', 'places', 'where', 'looked', 'were', 'going', 'veer', 'off', 'territory', 'slick', 'complex', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'avoid', 'doing', 'so', 'however', 'turn', 'film', 'regular', 'reference', 'Thomas', 'Angel', 'Vincent', 'Kartheiser', 'resembling', 'Hunter', 'son', 'Kyle', 'one', 'point', 'Thomas', 'going', 'try', 'play', 'one', 'reference', 'then', 'entire', 'line', 'thinking', 'disappears', 'script', 'tried', 'do', 'one', 'way', 'decided', 'do', 'way', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'get', 'everything', 'revised', 'script', 'first', 'way', 'then', 'failed', 'catch', 'error', 'least', 'hope', 'case', 'was', 'actually', 'meant', 'come', 'off', 'screenwriter', 'Miguel', 'Tejada-Flores', 'heart', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'checking', 'recent', 'credits', 'include', 'such', 'timeless', 'fare', 'Darkness', 'Rottweiler', 'however', 'find', 'could', 'also', 'be', 'incorrect', 'could', 'really', 'just', 'be', 'bad', 'rule', 'have', 'tradition', 'films', 'most', 'time', ""'re"", 'better', 'off', 'watching', 'movie', 'coattail-riding', 'dog', 'tradition', 'case', 'rule', 'up', 'Maybe', 'even', 'better', 'most', 'times', 'Garcia', ""n't"", 'enough', 'save', 'one', 'serious', 'eye', 'candy', 'triple-threat', 'Polo', 'young', 'Linda', 'Cardellini', 'Chelsea', 'Field', '*']",N/A
