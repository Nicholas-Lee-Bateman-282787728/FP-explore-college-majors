Sure, the symbolic death of the father might be found as well as a very literal carnal commerce with the mother. Savage Grace is mainly a story about a boy growing up and struggling with his existential dilemmas and dealing with that to which Jacques Lacan or Zizek would refer as ""the real"" in opposition to ""reality"". Here reality is that of a wealthy family with a life full of luxuries and eccentricities. But that's reality. The symbolic order. Beneath all that there is an excess, something that can be neither subdued nor fully explained.Lacan also said that desire would be connected to the real. And thus when desire conquers everything, the ugly truth shows up in the surface. But I won't spoil the grim finale even to those who might have heard about the real case that inspired this story.It's interesting, however, to observe that young Baekeland is in-between-places. His sexuality seems to surmount the models Lacan would include in his orthodox sexuation graphic. He has homosexual encounters at a very early age and then later on. But that does not seem to seclude him from other experiences (namely the incestuous aspect of the relationship with his mother).I would say that the ultimate failure comes from his inability to articulate his desire.

The subject, however, is Barbara Daly Baekeland, the wealthy wife of Brooks Baekeland, grandson of Leo Baekeland, founder of Bakelite plastic. It only becomes pertinent when you realize her son Antony is the heir to a major plastics company. Directed by Tom Kalin, a leader in the New Queer Cinema movement, the time-spanning story focuses on the unhealthy co-dependence that seems to have developed since birth between mother and son, a relationship that takes an unsavory turn toward incest and ultimately murder.Howard A. Rodman's screenplay covers over a quarter-century of the characters' lives beginning in 1946 when a vivacious Barbara dotes on her baby Antony even as she gallivants amid the Manhattan social scene. The story quickly flashes forward to Paris when a precocious, 14-year-old Antony remains devoted to his mother even when she embarrasses him by forcing him to read a passage from de Sade'sJustinein front of a small gathering of pretentious socialites. Another seven years pass, and a sexually awakened Antony takes up with a young, pot-smoking Spaniard named Jake, while Barbara has been deserted by her husband Brooks for a younger woman who once bedded Antony. As with many women of her standing, Barbara becomes involved with a gay ""walker"", Sam, who becomes Barbara's erudite escort. More transgressions occur until we catch up with mother and son living together in London in 1972. The Oedipal machinations come into fruition there leading to the tragic conclusion.The movie is really an extended exercise in self-loathing spotlighting truly unlikable characters, chief among them the grasping Barbara and the psychologically damaged Antony. The stilted dialogue doesn't help much either. You walk away understanding what would drive Antony to schizophrenia but are given little reason to care what happens. No stranger to mid-century roles (Far from Heaven,The Hours), Julianne Moore is one of our most accomplished actresses, and she manages to etch a powerful portrait of a deeply disturbed and irredeemable woman despite the odds. However, Kalin leaves her stranded in a role that elicits no sympathy. The same fate befalls Eddie Redmayne (The Other Boleyn Girl) as the grown Antony, and his performance becomes a series of limp-wristed mannerisms that remind me a bit of Cillian Murphy's work inBreakfast on Pluto. Stephen Dillane hardly makes an impression as Brooks, but Hugh Dancy (Evening,The Jane Austen Book Club) certainly makes a more convincing ""walker"" than Woody Harrelson did inThe Walker.

Aronson's brutally realistic book by the same name of a famous wealthy family's downfall. Director Tom Kalin has previously proved that he can successfully mix biopic with drama ('Swoon'), but alas in this tedious film he fails to make the audience care about any of his characters, despite the fact that he cast this strange collection of edgy types with outstanding actors.  In the end, after witnessing an incestuous relationship between mother and son and a subsequent brutal murder, the only moment of tenderness is a very lost boy's need to recover the collar of his childhood dog, long dead but hardly forgotten in the murky soup that has been his life.Knowing that the story is true adds a bit of intrigue: the family of a plastics mogul is in the third generation: Brooks Baeklande (Stephen Dillane) wallows in his wealth without positively contributing to his family reputation; his wife Barbara (Julianne Moore), a former actress and Feline's salesgirl who marries into wealth only to become obsessed with climbing a ladder that repeatedly betrays her 'class'; their only son Antony (Eddie Redmayne) who moves from his mother's worshipped idol to his father's loathed rival at his being bisexual/gay to a series of affairs - none of which he finds satisfying or fulfilling, especially his ultimate incestuous relationship with his mother. The film runs from 1946 (Antony's birth) to 1972 and the tragic finale and during this time the audience is conducted through the superficial corridors of life among the wealthy and influential people of New York, Paris, London, Cadaques.  Along the way we meet some interesting characters, paramours of Antony played by Elena Anaya, the gifted actors Unax Ugalde and Hugh Dancy, and a host of other bit parts who enliven the action or act as stimuli for the crumbling downfall of Barbara Baekeland.The various periods of time are well captured by cinematographer Juan Miguel Azpiroz who manages to give us the 'superficial beauty' of these empty souls while keeping a safe distance from their degrading antics.  The musical score by Fernando Vel&aacute;zquez is always too loud and falls between the cracks of elevator Muzak and takeoffs on Wagner's leitmotifs from 'Tristan und Isolde'.The major problem with this film is that it is nearly impossible for us to emotionally invest in any of the characters, even as well defined as they are in the hands of such excellent actors. It is this distance that sinks the film, a 'biopic' about rather distasteful folks that offers little insight into the positive aspects of their deranged behavior.  Or perhaps that void is what Tom Kalin is striving to depict. It just misses.

1187072,A13TO5TU4A68LD,B001F0TM4Y,Gryphonisle,"[0, 1]","&#34;Savage Grace&#34; sanitizes the story of Barbara Daly Baekeland, who married into the Bakelite Plastics fortune and a life of splendidly idle wealth; and had a son, who violently murdered her.  She had told friends earlier that she'd seduced him to cure him of his homosexuality, but given her fragile, narcissistic state, it may well have been that with her diminished economics, and fading beauty, that her son was the only society man she could catch.Given the material, this should have been a fun film.  I would imagine something like Tennessee Williams meets Alfred Hitchcock.  Too much imagination for this one.  You can't take on incest, let alone matricide, timidly, or with half steps.  You can't make it tasteful.  The film tries, so the violent murder, which was in two attempts over a couple of weeks, is reduced to a simple stab to the heart;  Tony's schizophrenia appears in the last half hour, before that he's just an odd and quiet young man.The other problem with the film, which begins in 1946 and ends in 1972, is that it gets stuck in the fifties, when most of the action took place in the sixties.  Life for the rich didn't change a lot, but the world certainly did.  The US was falling apart;  an old social order was being torn down and little was being built in its place.  Yet the film stays in the fifties, in style, with luxe-fashion and beauty and only slight references to the profound changes in the way people dressed and the way places looked.  In 1946 you dressed up, suits, hats, gloves for women, to go into New York City.  In 1969, barefoot hippies nursed their babies in public, on park benches.  Given that Barbara Baekeland's life was falling apart about in line with the decline of the US, giving some attention to the outside world would have emphasized what was going on in her world.  Not this film.The result is an arch costume drama performed by mannequins.  Julianne Moore, the whole reason I watched this film, didn't help.  In the right hands she has the personna of a Movie Star;  the good looks, the gorgeous voice, and the oddest laugh, which isn't so much catching but commanding---ordering you to laugh with her;  which always adds a touch of madness to any scene in which she uses it.

He also was inThe Hours, for which Julianne Moore got a supporting actress Oscar nomination.  As Brooks Baekeland, he plays a cold, unfeeling father who seems to have contempt for his son from the cradle.  His wife Barbara is played by Julianne Moore.  Her red hair is lovely; and Moore attacks the part with wild relish.  Barbara's uninhibited physicality seems to have attracted Brooks, but then becomes a barrier between them as husband and wife.  Julianne Moore has three other Oscar nominations (""Boogie Nights,"" ""The End of the Affair,"" & ""Far from Heaven""), and turns in a fine performance, although the character's behavior is somewhat inexplicable.  There is a mild hint of revulsion that Barbara expresses as she walks in on her son Tony with Black Jake, played by Unax Ugalde.  But then she hires the gay Sam Green to help her after her divorce.  Green is played by Hugh Dancy who was excellent inEvening.  The concluding event seems to come from nowhere.  I think this is a screenwriter's problem rather than an actress's ability to express subtext.  Eddie Redmayne who was inThe Good Shepherd (Widescreen Edition)plays the adult son Tony.  Barney Clark does an excellent setup for Redmayne as the young Tony.  However, adult Tony seems to be the go-between peacemaker between his estranged parents.  The violent climax and detachment seems to also come out of nowhere.  Again, this seems to be a problem of the screenwriter.  Elena Anaya plays Blanca, Brooks' second wife.  Tom Kalin who has made a name directing gay-themed films like ""Swoon"" allows for numerous bumps along this episodic tale.  The DVD extras aren't that helpful and seemed thrown together relying on lots of footage from the film without adding much information.  While all three leading actors and the supporting roles offer good moments on film, the project doesn't shed light on the story.  The non-maternal actions of Barbara's character were very hard to watch.  This is a film with which I'm not glad to have spent time.

1187125,A1GTTC7MA3XK2X,B001F0TM4Y,"Sue D. ""jediwoman""","[0, 1]","I really love Julianne Moore. But, considering the movie's rating, I nearly passed this one up. As a lawyer, I am always drawn to true crime. Long ago, I gave up being surprised by our capacity for cruelty or by what people do to one another - especially those who allegedly ""love"" one another. Call me a cynic, but I've come to believe that rage is the flip side of love. Parricide, more specifically matricide, is rare, but when it does occur, the lemmings are taken by surprise. (The only real surprise is that no one saw it coming!)This ""family"" psychodrama has a little bit of everything: debauchery, murder, drugs, incest, overindulgence, madness. Oh! The lifestyles of the rich & famous! Behavior tolerated in wealthy parents would have gotten this child removed from poor or middle class parents by  Child Protective Services YEARS before the cracks started to appear. But, I digress!My issue with Savage Grace  has to do with editing & time constraints. Some of it didn't make sense until I went sleuthing on my own. The movie portrayed Tony as a momma's boy, spoiled and isolated from other kids his age. But, the real Tony was the type of little kid who enjoyed pulling the wings off of flies to see them suffer. While not completely unusual in a child too young to understand consequences vs. actions, or ethical principles, it's up to the parents to teach their kids to ""do unto others"", especially when it concerns the more vulnerable among us: kids & animals, for example. The genuine shocker here is that Brooks took Tony's cruelty toward ""lesser creatures"" as a sign of genius! Family friends related their revulsion at observing adolescent Tony yanking the legs off of crabs as Barbara and Brooks watched, unconcerned!Family friends recounted many troubling anecdotes. In the movie, young Tony is prodded to read to guests a passage from ""Justine""  as a demonstration of his mastery of French. Tony eventually escapes - the guests, sensing his discomfort,  make excuses about needing to be elsewhere. It was not just shocking that neither Barbara nor Brooks thought the writings of the Marquis de Sade were inappropriate for a kid his age, but that ""normal"" people would gossip about the incident but not mention it to whatever authorities existed back then. It seems that many people saw what was going on, yet no one made an effort to intervene. Sure, I am aware there were few protections for kids back then. My point is that many people watched but no one made the effort!Mental illness apparently ran rampant in this family. Nini, Barbara's mother, had a ""breakdown"" a few years prior to giving birth to Barbara. When Barbara was 10, Frank, her dad, stuffed the exhaust pipe of his car and checked out permanently. (Perhaps he was the only SANE member of that family!) After Frank's life insurance paid off, Nini moved teenage Barbara to New York City where she modeled for several fashion magazines. Nini made sure Barbara understood the value in snagging the richest man she could find! Barbara met Brooks after being invited to Hollywood for a screen test. The ultra conservative right win tabloid the Daily Mail claimed that Barbara ""tricked"" Brooks into marrying her by claiming she was pregnant. (Consider the source while judging the veracity of that claim). The Mail also claims that Barbara had a history of mental illness prior to meeting Brooks.  Barbara probably began displaying symptoms of Borderline Personality Disorder in her early teens, possibly after the suicide of her father.  (Some researchers dispute the existence of BPD entirely, claiming that it is, in fact, an offshoot of PTSD). Frank's suicide would trigger symptoms of instability in Barbara. The premise of BPD is an overwhelming and pathological fear of abandonment and suicide sure qualifies. I cant imagine how a 10 year old handles the suicide of a parent.Brooks' grandfather was a very talented chemist who invented the first plastic material. It was said that the grandfather's first love was money - NOT science. It seems that Brooks inherited his grandfather's genius for science, as well as his love of money. Brooks never pursued anything but women.  Worship of excess was passed on in the Baekeland genes.Barbara grew up  a paragon of Borderline Personality Disorder. (Often described as histrionic behavior).. As revenge for Brooks' incessant tomcatting, Barbara would threaten and/or attempt suicide, which brought him back.  Eventually, Barbara's scheme backfired.  Brooks threatened to leave her for a much younger woman, Barbara attempted suicide. Brooks' mistress, being a crafty sort herself, attempted suicide to prevent Brooks (or his wallet) from running back to Barbara. (Brooks must have had a soft spot for Borderlines).  Brooks chose his mistress over Barbara. Divorce set the downward spiral in motion.One of the reasons given for the movies's low rating was that the screen writers failed to ""create likable characters"".This BIOPIC is the true story of a world created by unlimited amounts of cash - where societal rules, norms & laws don't apply.  Americans have a boundless (and unwholesome) admiration for the wealthy. Such people also tend to be completely insulated from, and indeed look down upon,  people who work to survive. The wealthy often express the belief that basic human needs should be satisfied only in  those who can afford it. They tend to support the concept of social darwinism. (Why? Limiting the distribution of resources means more for the 'haves'). Such attitudes have lead to some of the most egregious & grotesque atrocities in human history.The simplistic conclusion to be drawn from this movie is that Barbara was unable to accept her son's homosexuality and that is what led to tragedy. Tony had his first sexual encounter with another boy by the age of 8 - and was routinely picking up ""male"" tricks from the street at the age of 14.  Desperately insulated from reality - Barbara paid women to have sex with Tony to turn him away from sexual attraction to men. When that didn't work she bragged to friends, and even to Brooks, that she would seduce Tony to ""cure"" him. Brooks allegedly warned Barbara to steer clear of such behavior. (He likely gossiped about it to others. Yet, he not only fails to intervene but obstructs Tony's treatment by refusing to pay for his psychiatrist). By this time, Tony was a grown man. A very damaged, but fully grown, adult man. Tony allegedly confessed to a friend that he was having sex with his mother & felt trapped.  While the movie implied that the sexual connection between Tony and Barbara started shortly before her murder, I read somewhere that it was ongoing for more than 3 years. Wow!Brooks was well aware that Tony was decompensating. In fact, Brooks' young wife reported that Tony left notes for his father in their flower garden. (A scene depicted in the movie).  She confronted Brooks about Tony's childish, bizarre behavior. Brooks was uniquely positioned to salvage his son - but he was too busy satisfying his own hedonistic appetites.  Don't get me wrong. I am neither a prude nor a social conservative. When you have a kid(s) - you put your OWN stuff on hold until your kids are able to fend for themselves - IF EVER.  If that means you are stuck with the tab for the remainder of your life - OH WELL!  Regarding the excuses about being ""trapped"" by Barbara - Brooks was one of the wealthiest men in the world. He could well have afforded a condom if he didn't want to have kids. Once they had Tony - Tony was their problem for the remainder of their time on planet earth. But Tony was caught between Barbara - who had NO boundaries whatsoever, and  lived vicariously through her very disturbed son, and Brooks - who carried on as if he were a bachelor without any responsibilities.The worst part is - by the time Tony want sentenced to Broadmoor (Britain's Hospital for the criminally insane) for murder, Brooks already had a NEW SON with his ""new & improved"" wife. Brooks wasn't involved in Tony's life. (Except to refuse to provide his psychiatric care).The characters in this movie are flawed, YES! Barbara, however, was not the only source of Tony's psychopathy. How facile to point to the incest as the crux of the tragedy. Tony began showing very troubling symptoms long before adulthood. While Barbara was sending Tony to therapy, Brooks did what he could to sabotage his treatment, believing psychiatrists to be ""professionally amoral"".When Tony showed signs of impulsive violence, he was admitted to a private psychiatric hospital. But when Brooks refused to pay the medical bills, Tony was cut loose after a few weeks. Brooks believed that Tony wasn't mentally ill but rather inherently evil. Time and time again Brooks obstructed Tony's psychiatric care, care that might have salvaged him, or at least prevented this murder.Even after making the first serious attempt on his mother's life, interrupted only by timely intervention of a close friend,  , Barbara refused to press charges. A few weeks prior to the murder, Tony's psychiatrist was so disturbed by a session that he tracked Barbara down and confronted her with the reality that Tony WOULD kill her. He even asked the London police to post a guard outside of Barbara's house. He was the one person in the picture who seemed aware of the pain being suffered by all the members of this family. Ever the blind optimist, Barbara refused to believe Tony would hurt her.Tony fatally stabbed her a few weeks after, then calmly picked up the phone to order Chinese food.These characters are indeed disquieting, at times, repulsive. This movie is about people who eat their young. These are real people. It isn't up to the screen writer or director to change characters to make them warm, fuzzy, or engaging for the audience.  Maybe we have forgotten the value of the morality play or the cautionary tale. Savage Grace is the story of real people who have no concept of human dignity.  Moore does an incredible job recreating the character of Barbara, a beautiful but completely crazy woman who dons a mask of sanity. Her bizarre behavior is as impulsive as it is manipulative.  Stephen Dillane does an equally compelling job portraying Brooks Baeklande, an intellectually gifted man whose knack for science is only outpaced by his lack of ambition to accomplish anything gainful. Finally, British Actor Eddie Redmayne is brilliant as the hopelessly mad and violently impulsive young heir to the Baeklande fortune.  This is a complicated story with interwoven and strikingly ugly family dynamics, replete with vacuous characters. These people look attractive and seem to have everything until you look closely. They are the living dead - emotional vampires with no real values other than love of wealth and a drice to accumulation more. They'd sell one another if the price were right.Savage Grace is impossibly complex; it cannot be distilled to 97 minutes.  It serves as a cautionary tale to our wealth-obsessed culture. Money does not buy wisdom, empathy, love or success. It might enable people to look chic - but underneath the mask live plastic people. manikins without souls. Wealth will NEVER make us caring, empathetic, and compassionate human beings.Yet, we trust these types with the future of our country and the well being of future generations. Why?",4,This is what it looks like when people eat their own young.,1380326400,"09 28, 2013",2013,11346,"['really', 'love', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'considering', 'movie', 'rating', 'nearly', 'passed',

Her drinking, making scenes in public, and adulterous flings made the marriage a living nightmare.  She was a smothering mother to her gay son, Tony, and the family lived a dysfunctional love triangle that ended in violence and bloodshed.This is Moore's film all the way.  She conveys a sense of inferiority percolating within, since Barbara did marry well above her social station.  She needs constant reassurance that she is loved, and craves social acceptance like a drug.  Moore makes a rather unpleasant character interesting.  Maybe it's the voyeur effect.  We feel we're peeking into a privileged world, seeing all its frayed corners and cracks in close-up.  And we're fascinated because it's exotic.
