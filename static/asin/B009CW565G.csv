The family needs help with their flailing B&B; as a ruthless, competitor, Daphne Zuniga, pressures them to sell out.  There's also internal strife between brothers, and a girlfriend urging the son to return to the city.  Will he do the right thing?  Can the family and the B&B; be saved?  Is there a love with the right person blossoming?  Stay tuned.We pretty much know the outcomes, and it's a pleasant enough journey.  There's no earth shattering revelations or shocking discoveries.SunWorld Pictures puts out these films, Scents and Sensibility, Civil Love, Christmas Angel.  They offer the same premise of romance, a light moral message and a Dove approved film.  They interchange the actors; same crew and directors, Brian Brough directed this one and several others.  They're not high budget films, and this one has it's slow parts, but I think, overall, they do a good job putting it all together.We enjoy family films, best of all, if not overly corny or pretentious, and I think for the most part they're reaching that here.
