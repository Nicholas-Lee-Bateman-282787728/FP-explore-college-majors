It's an absolutely torturous road movie which has got to be one of the worst films made in recent years.  Basically, Nick, played by Ice Cube, gets a crush on a single mother, only they more or less develop a platonic relationship instead. She has two demon children who don't want her to date anybody. They are selfish and generally terrible monsters. They barely seem to have a shred of decency.  none of the characters in this film are at all likable, except maybe Nick. Poor old Nick offers to drive the children across the country in his new car as a huge favour for the mother. Huge mistake. Here begins a part of the film even worse than the beginning where everything that could possibly go wrong goes wrong. Bad things happen to Nick, his car starts to become a wreck, and this is supposed to be funny?  The only thing amusing in this film was when Nick referred to Suzanne as a ""breeder"" and when that annoying Hamster Dance song came on.  As annoying as that song is, you can't help but smile.Watch this movie and you'll probably want to take a vow of celibacy.",2,Are we DONE yet?,1154217600,"07 30, 2006",2006,1160,"['Are', 'Yet', 'clever', 'title', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'torturous', 'road', 'movie', 'got', 'be', 'one', 'worst', 'films', 'made', 'recent', 'years', 'Basically', 'Nick', 'played', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'crush', 'single', 'mother', 'only', 'more', 'less', 'develop', 'platonic', 'relationship', 'instead', 'two', 'demon', 'children', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'date', 'anybody', 'are', 'selfish', 'generally', 'terrible', 'monsters', 'barely', 'seem', 'have', 'shred', 'decency', 'none', 'characters', 'film', 'are', 'likable', 'maybe', 'Nick', 'Poor', 'old', 'Nick', 'drive', 'children', 'country', 'new', 'car', 'huge', 'favour', 'mother', 'Huge', 'mistake', 'Here', 'part', 'film', 'even', 'worse', 'beginning', 'where', 'everything', 'could', 'possibly', 'go', 'wrong', 'wrong', 'Bad', 'things', 'happen', 'Nick', 'car', 'become', 'wreck', 'supposed', 'be', 'funny', 'only', 'thing', 'amusing', 'film', 'was', 'when', 'Nick', 'referred', 'Suzanne', 'breeder', 'when', 'annoying', 'Hamster', 'Dance', 'song', 'came', 'annoying', 'song', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'smile.Watch', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'want', 'take', 'vow', 'celibacy']",N/A

Sometimes it's preferable to just RELAX with a great comedy, especially when it's a well-executed one like Are We There Yet? is.It's about Ice Cub (not sure what his real name is... though it'd be sort of weird if his mother actually named him Ice Cube at birth!) finding a woman across the street from his store really attractive, but when he goes over to talk to her... he realizes she has kids.  KIDS!  Yes my friends, nobody likes a woman with kids (only kidding!)Ice Cube feels utter disappointment until fate would have him meeting up with the woman on a rainy night to help jumpstart a car.  From there, a relationship is born however... guess what?  Her kids HATE Ice Cube!  In fact they dislike any man that tries picking up their mother, so... what do these children do about it, you wonder?  They torment the living heck out of Ice Cube using every trick in their arsenal!  Hey, that's what you feel like you HAVE to do when you're a kid, in order to protect your parents (at least, that's why I did it... though not quite THIS crazily, hehe).Eventually Ice Cube has to take these kids across country to meet up with their mother, and oh boy, do *several* crazy things happen along the way.  Do they ever happen!  These kids lock Ice Cube out of the car and take over the steering wheel in a parking lot while Ice Cube is fighting to get inside (best segment of the movie) and another memorable segment occurs when the kids hop aboard a train and force Ice Cube to ride a HORSE in order to catch up to them.  Naughty kids!  I had to laugh when they escape Ice Cube and the daughter says ""Do you think we were too hard on him?""  LOL!Just a really hilarious movie from beginning to end.

Because my choices were limited, I was stuck with choosing between this one or National Treasure. Thankfully, I chose ""Are We There Yet?"". I'm really glad I did because this movie is downright hilarious. The story goes a lil something like this....Nick, a playboy bachelor, and Suzanne, a divorced mother of two, is threatened by a particularly harrowing New Year's Eve. When Suzanne's work keeps her in New York City for the holiday, Nick offers to bring her kids to the city from Washington D.C. The kids, who have never liked any of the men their mom has dated in the past, are determined to turn the trip a nightmare for Nick. And, boy, is it ever a nightmare. Ice Cube turns in one of his most comedic performances in his career in this movie. I didn't think I'd like this movie too much beforehand but, after watching it, I think it was money well spent. I'm really glad it was the first movie that I got for my PSP. Which, I'd like to add as a sidenote, the PSP's capabilties of showing movies on the system is well past what I expected of it. It's high quality UMD video. I commend Sony for doing such an outstanding job with the PSP(It's, definitely, the Walkman of the 21st century). I can't wait to see what other movies will become available for the PSP now.

They go from the most obnoxious kids on Earth to decent ones once they see their dad has another life now. Ice Cube goes from a gigolo to a family man in a life changing turn of events. Overall we found it entertaining and would recommend to families. I personally have not seen a movie cut just like this as some critics indicate. I think it has replayability and so I bought a copy. This road trip movie is likely to entertain those that found the ""Home Alone"", ""Planes, Trains, and Automobiles"", or ""Jingle All the Way"" movies funny.

I think some people get to wrapped up in how unrealistic the people are in the movie, especially the kids. If you took one or two things the kids do it would be believable.

He performs to perfection in this genuinely charming comedy.  He reminds me of Steve Martin in that he seems to have the IT factor that makes a person funny - kind of the opposite of Pauly Shore, if you know what I mean?Are We There Yet? is a movie that people of all ages can enjoy.  Ice Cube, and the rest of the cast, of course, made this film a pleasure to watch.Yes, it is predictable.  Yes, it is even a very simple plot that unfolds rather quickly, and unlike the classic Adventures in Baby-sitting, this movie found itself relying more on acting than an abundance of side-plots.Nia Long was convincing in her role as the single parent, but I think the audience knew too little about her character throughout the film.  This error was in the script and not in Nia's inability to act.  There's no doubt Nia Long can play to the big screen.  She has been in a LOT of movies, and she always nails her role.Aleisha Allen, who was in The School of Rock, is absolutely adorable as the destructive and vindictive Lindsey Kingston.  She did not overact the way some child actresses do.Kudos to her onscreen brother, too.  Philip Bolden has a long career ahead of him.  Put this kid in a (an) M. Night Shyamalan movie and watch him steal the show!All and all, this simple comedy really delivers the goods.

The Ice Cube of today is a long way removed from the gun toting, foul mouthed Ice Cube of the gang movie and hip hop culture of the early 1990s. Don't get me wrong: Boyz in the Hood is an important film, and his early rap albums are some of the best in the genre.But in this movie, Ice Cube is downright loveable and cuddly, and he gives a refreshingly domesticated performance as Nick Persons. Nick tries to woo an attractive divorcee (Nia Long) into dating him by taking her kids on a long distance trip to Vancouver. I guess the idea is that if he can do her this favor and show that he is making an effort to bond with the children, she will receive him.But everything that could possibly go wrong on this trip goes wrong. The kids turn out to be hellishly behaved kids, almost as bad as some of the characters that Ice Cube has played in the past, and undeniably more annoying.The things the kids do to torture poor Nick can hardly be construed as humor in retrospect, but that is how the gags are presented. The movie turns around at the halfway point when Nick starts to love the children in spite of the fact that they are abusing him, and the kids start to love Nick in spite of the fact that he likes their mom.Up until the movie's midway point, you can't help but wonder, ""Who in the world would want anything to do with these rotten kids? Why doesn't Nick just turn around and drop them off back the house and movie on with his life?"" The movie's answer is a poignant tribute to unconditional parental love.The gags are cruel, the kids are mean, and Nick's Lincoln Navigator is destined for eternal destruction, but the movie ends up winning you over after a faltering start.",3,Enjoyable and Yet Disturbing,1156291200,"08 23, 2006",2006,1739,"['have', 'confess', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'today', 'long', 'way', 'removed', 'gun', 'toting', 'foul', 'mouthed', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'gang', 'movie', 'hip', 'hop', 'culture', 'early', '1990s', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'Boyz', 'Hood', 'important', 'film', 'early', 'rap', 'albums', 'are', 'best', 'genre.But', 'movie', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'downright', 'loveable', 'cuddly', 'refreshingly', 'domesticated', 'performance', 'Nick', 'Persons', 'Nick', 'woo', 'attractive', 'divorcee', 'Nia', 'Long', 'dating', 'taking', 'kids', 'long', 'distance', 'trip', 'Vancouver', 'guess', 'idea', 'can', 'do', 'favor', 'show', 'making', 'effort', 'bond', 'children', 'will', 'receive', 'him.But', 'everything', 'could', 'possibly', 'go', 'wrong', 'trip', 'wrong', 'kids', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'hellishly', 'behaved', 'kids', 'almost', 'as', 'bad', 'characters', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'played', 'past', 'undeniably', 'more', 'annoying.The', 'things', 'kids', 'do', 'torture', 'poor', 'Nick', 'can', 'hardly', 'be', 'construed', 'humor', 'retrospect', 'how', 'gags', 'are', 'presented', 'movie', 'around', 'halfway', 'point', 'when', 'Nick', 'love', 'children', 'spite', 'fact', 'are', 'abusing', 'kids', 'start', 'love', 'Nick', 'spite', 'fact', 'mom.Up', 'movie', 'midway', 'point', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'Who', 'world', 'would', 'want', 'anything', 'do', 'rotten', 'kids', 'Why', ""n't"", 'Nick', 'just', 'turn', 'around', 'drop', 'off', 'back', 'house', 'movie', 'life', 'movie', 'answer', 'poignant', 'tribute', 'unconditional', 'parental', 'love.The', 'gags', 'are', 'cruel', 'kids', 'are', 'mean', 'Nick', 'Lincoln', 'Navigator', 'destined', 'eternal', 'destruction', 'movie', 'up', 'winning', 'faltering', 'start']",N/A

However, if a movie is not really that funny, then contrived conflict is just another annoyance.In ""Are We There Yet,"" Ice Cube plays Nick, the owner of an upscale sports memorabilia store and a ""Playa.""  Nick is struck by lightning when he scopes Suzanne (Nia Long) across the street from his store, but is just as quickly turned off when he sees Suzanne's two children, Lindsey (Aleisha Allen) and Kevin (Philip Bolden.)  By chance, Suzanne's car stalls on a deserted highway on a rainy night, and Nick gets the chance to get to know Suzanne as a person, not to mention to show off his new, tricked-out Lincoln Navigator.  Lindsey and Kevin are convinced that their parents will eventually reunite, so the two do everything in their clever and bratty little heads to keep potential suitors away from their mom.  However, when the children's father is unable to take them, Nick volunteers to fly with the kids to Vancouver where Suzanne has a business event.  However, after a series of unfortunate, unlikely, and manufactured events, Nick decides to drive the kids to Vancouver in the Navigator.  Let's just say things get ugly for Nick.In general, such an adventure will eventually produce either a likeable protagonist, moral transformation of the antagonists, or both.  `Are We There Yet' fails to accomplish either.  Nick is inconsistent in his approach to the Lindsey and Kevin, and he varies in his desire to strangle or to hug the two ornery little brats.  (I can't say that I could have blamed him if Nick did actually strangle the kids.  At least Nick would have gone to prison and the movie would have ended there.)  Lindsey and Kevin themselves never really seem to get the point that treating other people, adults, like refuse is not the way to a happy ending.  Even the happy ending was forced.`Are We There Yet' certainly had potential, however.  Small roles for Nichelle Nichols (who portrayed Lieutenant Uhuru in the original Star Trek television show and films) as Miss Marble, the kids' babysitter, Jay Mohr as Marty, Nick's employee at the memorabilia store, and Tracy Morgan as the voice of the Satchel Paige bobble-head doll provided the opportunity for a lot of fun for both children and parents in the audience.  However, very little of the characters' jokes or personalities were very well developed, and thus fell flat.  (Marty did have the line of the movie though.  When talking with Nick on his cell phone during his trip through Hell after Nick endures yet another particularly difficult onslaught from Lindsey and Kevin, Marty quips, ""If the kids hate ya,' Mommy won't date ya.'"")  Even Nia Long's character, Suzanne underwent a frightening transformation from a loving, potential love interest for Nick to some sort of shallow mega-bitch.In short, there is not much here.  The silly, slapstick humor fell short.  The kid's behavior was not funny and a poor model for a young audience.  `Are We There Yet' was simply all over the place and never quite went anywhere.  I guess it's better than Vancouver.",2,All over the place and never quite went anywhere,1139788800,"02 13, 2006",2006,3149,"['nothing', 'wrong', 'contrived', 'conflict', 'move', 'plot', 'especially', 'slapstick', 'kid', 'comedy', 'However', 'movie', 'not', 'really', 'funny', 'then', 'contrived', 'conflict', 'just', 'annoyance.In', 'Are', 'Yet', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'Nick', 'owner', 'upscale', 'sports', 'memorabilia', 'store', 'Playa', 'Nick', 'struck', 'lightning', 'when', 'Suzanne', 'Nia', 'Long', 'street', 'store', 'just', 'quickly', 'turned', 'off', 'when', 'Suzanne', 'two', 'children', 'Lindsey', 'Aleisha', 'Allen', 'Kevin', 'Philip', 'Bolden', 'chance', 'Suzanne', 'car', 'stalls', 'deserted', 'highway', 'rainy', 'night', 'Nick', 'chance', 'get', 'know', 'Suzanne', 'person', 'not', 'mention', 'show', 'off', 'new', 'tricked-out', 'Lincoln', 'Navigator', 'Lindsey', 'Kevin', 'are', 'convinced', 'parents', 'will', 'eventually', 'reunite', 'two', 'do', 'everything', 'clever', 'bratty', 'little', 'heads', 'keep', 'potential', 'suitors', 'away', 'mom', 'However', 'when', 'children', 'father', 'unable', 'take', 'Nick', 'volunteers', 'fly', 'kids', 'Vancouver', 'where', 'Suzanne', 'business', 'event', 'However', 'series', 'unfortunate', 'unlikely', 'manufactured', 'events', 'Nick', 'drive', 'kids', 'Vancouver', 'Navigator', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'things', 'get', 'ugly', 'Nick.In', 'general', 'such', 'adventure', 'will', 'eventually', 'produce', 'likeable', 'protagonist', 'moral', 'transformation', 'antagonists', 'Are', 'Yet', 'fails', 'accomplish', 'either', 'Nick', 'inconsistent', 'approach', 'Lindsey', 'Kevin', 'desire', 'strangle', 'hug', 'two', 'ornery', 'little', 'brats', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'could', 'have', 'blamed', 'Nick', 'did', 'actually', 'strangle', 'kids', 'least', 'Nick', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'prison', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'ended', 'there', 'Lindsey', 'Kevin', 'never', 'really', 'seem', 'get', 'point', 'treating', 'other', 'people', 'adults', 'refuse', 'not', 'way', 'happy', 'ending', 'Even', 'happy', 'ending', 'was', 'forced.', 'Are', 'Yet', 'certainly', 'had', 'potential', 'however', 'Small', 'roles', 'Nichelle', 'Nichols', 'who', 'portrayed', 'Lieutenant', 'Uhuru', 'original', 'Star', 'Trek', 'television', 'show', 'films', 'Miss', 'Marble', 'kids', 'babysitter', 'Jay', 'Mohr', 'Marty', 'Nick', 'employee', 'memorabilia', 'store', 'Tracy', 'Morgan', 'voice', 'Satchel', 'Paige', 'bobble-head', 'doll', 'provided', 'opportunity', 'lot', 'fun', 'children', 'parents', 'audience', 'However', 'very', 'little', 'characters', 'jokes', 'personalities', 'were', 'very', 'well', 'developed', 'thus', 'fell', 'flat', 'Marty', 'did', 'have', 'line', 'movie', 'When', 'talking', 'Nick', 'cell', 'phone', 'trip', 'Hell', 'Nick', 'yet', 'particularly', 'difficult', 'onslaught', 'Lindsey', 'Kevin', 'Marty', 'kids', 'hate', 'ya', 'Mommy', 'wo', ""n't"", 'date', 'ya', 'Even', 'Nia', 'Long', 'character', 'Suzanne', 'underwent', 'frightening', 'transformation', 'loving', 'potential', 'love', 'interest', 'Nick', 'sort', 'shallow', 'mega-bitch.In', 'short', 'not', 'much', 'here', 'silly', 'slapstick', 'humor', 'fell', 'short', 'kid', 'behavior', 'was', 'not', 'funny', 'poor', 'model', 'young', 'audience', 'Are', 'Yet', 'was', 'simply', 'place', 'never', 'quite', 'went', 'anywhere', 'guess', 'better', 'Vancouver']",N/A

He, of course, doesn't care about the children so he calls in sick, meaning that they're going to have to go on the business trip with her.

896971,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000803BQC,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","Are We There Yet? is a fun road movie replete with cute jokes and juvenile slapstick humor. It's somewhat reminiscent of Home Alone,  in terms of its over the top, tailored-for-kids sensibilities and its holiday setting. It offers two precocious kids Lindsey (Aleisha Allen) and Kevin (Philip Bolden), both of whom still harbor a hope of reconciliation between their divorced parents. They don't want any new guy to come in between, and, thus, they gleefully put Ice Cube thru his paces. You know what you're in for when you see urine and vomit spewage incorporated into the picture. But in the end, like all movies of this ilk, it's all sweetness and light and good family tidings.It's the Christmas season and Nick Persons (Ice Cube), owner of a cute store (or, as he insists on calling it: ""a fine sports collectible"" store), had just purchased his dream ride, a tricked-out Lincoln Navigator (with way cool dubs). Jay Mohr's character calls it ""6000 tons of respect."" Now equipped with all the bling-age he needs, he is ready to play. But, on that same day, he sees and is instantly smitten with Suzanne Kingston (Nia Long), a single mother of two. But Suzanne doesn't want a romantic entanglement because Nick hasn't even bothered to ask about her kids and probably doesn't even know their names (""Theo and Rudy?"" Nick ventures a guess). So Nick finds himself languishing in the ""friend zone"" and is ridiculed by his homies.To make things worse, he gets stuck having to drive the bratty kids from Portland all the way to Vancouver to hook them up with their mom for New Year's. When his attempts to fly and then take the train go awry, he ends up driving the kids in his cherished Navigator, which starts out in pristine condition and ends up totally wrecked. In their travels, the three make pit stops to meet misguided good-samaritan truckers, a crazed deer and combative snowmen. But, no worries. Nick the Quick will somehow come thru for Suzanne with the kids intact, even if you can't say the same for his ride.Ice Cube once again ventures into the wacky comedy genre and acquits himself very well. Over the years, Cube has been doing good film work and has snuck up on me as an actor. Nowadays, I think of him more in cinematic terms than from a music standpoint. Here he perfectly balances his wacky antics, good physical comedy work, and even some sensitive dramatic moments, while still remaining quinessentially Cube. This movie would've been better served with more screen time for Nia Long, who is cute but underused. The kids are pretty good, once they grew on me (I found them initially annoying and unlikable; Cube's character is a saint!). Jay Mohr's in there fleetingly and Nichelle Nichols (Star Trek's Uhura) cameos as the freaky Miss Mable.All in all, everything works with the possible exception of Nick's advice-happy Satchel Page bobblehead doll, of which gimmick I feel is unnecessary. So if you're looking for a pretty decent family flick the kids will like, this is the one. The humor here is definitely more up the kids' alley, with the adults perhaps rolling their eyes at all the crazy shenanigans.

Anything meant to be taken seriously is so over-the top or unrealistic that it is hard to find any true pleasure in this film.Despite the usually tame PG rating, I wanted to check out the movie before purchasing for my nearly 9-year-old son.First of all, would a 9-year-old find this movie entertaining?  Certainly!  There is a lot of childish slapstick to keep any 9-year-old on the edge of their seats.  There are some adult issues that come up, but nothing a 9-year-old really couldn't understand.But the bottom line is, I would feel uncomfortable having my 9-year-old watch this.  For two reasons:Mainly, it is the dialogue.  It was atrocious.  I wanted to take those kids and wash their mouths out with soup.  They said things that little kids should not be saying, or even thinking.  These are supposed to be sophisticated kids?  I'd hate to see what they think unsophisticated kids talk like.Also, it is the way the kids treat others.  They are just plain sadistic.

Naming the film ""Are We There Yet?""  does have a clever title, but that's the only good thing about the movie that I like. It's an absolutely torturous road movie which has got to be one of the worst films made in recent years, I now understand why it took me so long to see this family film. Basically, Nick, played by Ice Cube, gets a crush on a single mother, only they more or less develop a platonic relationship instead. She has two demon children who don't want her to date there mama.They are clearly selfish and generally terrible monsters. They barely seem to have a shred of decency, meaning that any children in the audience won't identify with them. This is a huge problem. Unfortunately, none of the characters in this film are at all likable, except maybe Nick. It was very obvious that the jokes were forced too. Poor old Nick offers to drive the children across the country in his new car as a huge favor for the mother. Huge mistake. Here begins a part of the film even worse than the beginning where everything that could possibly go wrong goes wrong. Bad things happen to Nick, his car starts to become a wreck, and this is supposed to be funny? In order to make people like this silly sort of humor, you need to make sure the children are sweet, and those being beaten up are bad (see ""Home Alone""). In this case, two demons are ruining things for a generally nice guy doing good deeds - and although he probably wants to get inside their mother's pants, he isn't a nasty person. There is a part where Nick gets bashed by a deer - the thing is so obviously computer-generated, and Ice Cube's reactions are so over-the-top, it is extremely painful to watch.If I was their mother (or Ice Cube) I  would definitely be teaching them a thing or two about respect and there is no way they could have pulled the stunts they did.

896986,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000803BQC,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 4]","There is quite a bit of perilous tightrope walking involved in mixing violent slapstick comedy and heartfelt pathos. Charlie Chaplin did it a lot and you can certainly point to the original ""Home Alone"" as being a successful mix. But in the former the target of the physical attacks was usually some guy twice the Little Tramp's size and in the latter it was the Wet Bandits. That is not the case with ""Are We There Yet?"" There are certainly some laughs to be had in this 2005 comedy, but for the most part I find myself cringing at what was happening on screen and the only reason director Brian Levant's film gets 3 stars is because there are a few success and rather important moments of pathos in this mess.Nick Persons (Ice Cube) has an upper scale sports collectible store and a brand-new Lincoln Navigator, when he is smitten by the sight of Suzanne Kingston (Nia Long). The bad news is that she is a single mom with a pair of terror tots, Lindsy (Aleisha Allen) and Kevin (Philip Daniel Bolden), who have been taking care of all of mom's would-be boyfriends. They are waiting for their mom to reconcile with their dad. Nick wants nothing to do with children, but he and Suzanne become friends and when she has to go to Vancouver for work and her ex-husband bails on having the kids for New Year's, he ends up agreeing to transport the kids and the madness begins.The core problem here is that these kids are viscous little monsters who physically assault innocent men. This is not cute little Kevin hurting the bad guys who are trying to rob his home, but two kids going after every guy who wants to date their mother. It is not funny it is mean. It is also dangerous, which gets us to another key problem with this movie in terms of how many times the attempted humor has to do with cars and trucks. In other words, situations that in the real world would get these kids killed are repeatedly done for laughs in this movie. Watching a couple of kids screaming while the car they are in is squeezed against the railing on the highway by a fully loaded semi-truck is not all that funny in the real world and we kept cringing through all of these types of scenes (there are several). Granted, it is not wise to confuse a movie with the real world, but there are moments when this film wants to talk to the reality that there are a large number of African-American children being raised without their fathers living in the house. More importantly, those are the best moments in the film.This is because Nick is not a bad guy, which is the flip side to the core problem, and another reason to cringe every time they go after him. Nick thinks he does not like children and this particular pair of demons give him ample reason to reinforce that idea, but when these children need help, physical or psychological, he immediately goes to their help. The latter is the more important part, because you know full well that these children are going to get their comeuppance when they find out the truth about their father and the moments in which Nick talks to the kids, as opposed to screaming or sticking out his tongue at them, are the best moments in this film because they are the most real.The fault for this film is to be found in the screenplay by Steven Gary Banks, Claudia Grazioso, J. David Stem and David N. Weiss (four writers is rarely a good sign), because the performances by Ice Cub and the two kids are fine given what was written (Long is reduced to a minor part in the story, which is why the resolution is problematic for me). Jay Mohr has a small part in this film as Marty, Nick's friend who keeps reminding him of how much he does not like kids, and Tracy Morgan does the voice of the Satchel Paige bobble-head doll that Nick has on the dashboard of his vehicle (who does Nick think will be watching DVDs in the backseat if he does not like children?). It was also great to see Nichelle Nichols in a bit part as Miss Mable. What would have been even better was a film that dealt more realistically with the basic idea, which is certainly an important one.",3,Cringing throughout a comedy is not a good thing,1118966400,"06 17, 2005",2005,4076,"['quite', 'bit', 'perilous', 'tightrope', 'walking', 'involved', 'mixing', 'violent', 'slapstick', 'comedy', 'heartfelt', 'pathos', 'Charlie', 'Chaplin', 'did', 'lot', 'can', 'certainly', 'point', 'original', 'Home', 'Alone', 'being', 'successful', 'mix', 'former', 'target', 'physical', 'attacks', 'was', 'usually', 'guy', 'twice', 'Little', 'Tramp', 'size', 'latter', 'was', 'Wet', 'Bandits', 'not', 'case', 'Are', 'Yet', 'are', 'certainly', 'laughs', 'be', 'had', '2005', 'comedy', 'most', 'part', 'find', 'cringing', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'screen', 'only', 'reason', 'director', 'Brian', 'Levant', 'film', '3', 'stars', 'are', 'few', 'success', 'rather', 'important', 'moments', 'pathos', 'mess.Nick', 'Persons', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'upper', 'scale', 'sports', 'collectible', 'store', 'brand-new', 'Lincoln', 'Navigator', 'when', 'smitten', 'sight', 'Suzanne', 'Kingston', 'Nia', 'Long', 'bad', 'news', 'single', 'mom', 'pair', 'terror', 'tots', 'Lindsy', 'Aleisha', 'Allen', 'Kevin', 'Philip', 'Daniel', 'Bolden', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'taking', 'care', 'mom', 'would-be', 'boyfriends', 'are', 'waiting', 'mom', 'reconcile', 'dad', 'Nick', 'nothing', 'do', 'children', 'Suzanne', 'become', 'friends', 'when', 'go', 'Vancouver', 'work', 'ex-husband', 'bails', 'having', 'kids', 'New', 'Year', 'up', 'agreeing', 'transport', 'kids', 'madness', 'begins.The', 'core', 'problem', 'here', 'kids', 'are', 'viscous', 'little', 'monsters', 'who', 'physically', 'assault', 'innocent', 'men', 'not', 'cute', 'little', 'Kevin', 'hurting', 'bad', 'guys', 'who', 'are', 'trying', 'rob', 'home', 'two', 'kids', 'going', 'guy', 'who', 'date', 'mother', 'not', 'funny', 'mean', 'also', 'dangerous', 'key', 'problem', 'movie', 'terms', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'attempted', 'humor', 'do', 'cars', 'trucks', 'other', 'words', 'situations', 'real', 'world', 'would', 'get', 'kids', 'killed', 'are', 'repeatedly', 'done', 'laughs', 'movie', 'Watching', 'couple', 'kids', 'screaming', 'car', 'are', 'squeezed', 'railing', 'highway', 'fully', 'loaded', 'semi-truck', 'not', 'funny', 'real', 'world', 'kept', 'cringing', 'types', 'scenes', 'are', 'several', 'Granted', 'not', 'wise', 'confuse', 'movie', 'real', 'world', 'are', 'moments', 'when', 'film', 'talk', 'reality', 'are', 'large', 'number', 'African-American', 'children', 'being', 'raised', 'fathers', 'living', 'house', 'More', 'importantly', 'are', 'best', 'moments', 'film.This', 'Nick', 'not', 'bad', 'guy', 'flip', 'side', 'core', 'problem', 'reason', 'cringe', 'time', 'go', 'Nick', 'not', 'like', 'children', 'particular', 'pair', 'demons', 'give', 'ample', 'reason', 'reinforce', 'idea', 'when', 'children', 'need', 'help', 'physical', 'psychological', 'immediately', 'help', 'latter', 'more', 'important', 'part', 'know', 'full', 'well', 'children', 'are', 'going', 'get', 'comeuppance', 'when', 'find', 'out', 'truth', 'father', 'moments', 'Nick', 'talks', 'kids', 'opposed', 'screaming', 'sticking', 'out', 'tongue', 'are', 'best', 'moments', 'film', 'are', 'most', 'real.The', 'fault', 'film', 'be', 'found', 'screenplay', 'Steven', 'Gary', 'Banks', 'Claudia', 'Grazioso', 'J.', 'David', 'Stem', 'David', 'N.', 'Weiss', 'four', 'writers', 'rarely', 'good', 'sign', 'performances', 'Ice', 'Cub', 'two', 'kids', 'are', 'fine', 'given', 'what', 'was', 'written', 'Long', 'reduced', 'minor', 'part', 'story', 'why', 'resolution', 'problematic', 'Jay', 'Mohr', 'small', 'part', 'film', 'Marty', 'Nick', 'friend', 'who', 'reminding', 'how', 'much', 'not', 'like', 'kids', 'Tracy', 'Morgan', 'voice', 'Satchel', 'Paige', 'bobble-head', 'doll', 'Nick', 'dashboard', 'vehicle', 'who', 'Nick', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'watching', 'DVDs', 'backseat', 'not', 'like', 'children', 'was', 'also', 'great', 'see', 'Nichelle', 'Nichols', 'bit', 'part', 'Miss', 'Mable', 'What', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'even', 'better', 'was', 'film', 'more', 'realistically', 'basic', 'idea', 'certainly', 'important', 'one']",N/A

Well, he finds the attractive Suzanne Kingston (Nia Long) and wants to court her, but he has to deal with her two children Lindsey (Aleisha Allen) and Kevin (Philip Daniel Bolden).  Well, Suzanne goes to Vancouver, misses the kids, and since their biological father cancelled his visitation appointment with them, Nick is destined to drive the kids from Portland, OR to Vancouver so he can show her what a swell guy he is.  Nick hates the kids, the kids hate Nick, so they kids do everything possible to sabotage Nick quest to court their mother.  During the process though, Nick realizes he's starting to develop feelings for the kids and the kids realize how hard Nick's trying to be a good guy.  Will it be enough to win Suzanne over?  (News Flash:  This isn't exactly a movie with a lot of twists and turns, so I think you can figure that one out...)I took my sister to see this one and she enjoyed it immensely as a 10-year-old.  I sat through it thinking ""Geez... are they there yet?!""  The kids were good at what they did and I could see a case made that maybe it wasn't the actors and actresses' fault this movie suffered.

To this end, they devise elaborate schemes to sabotage her chances with any man unfortunate enough to show the slightest romantic interest in her.  Enter Nick Persons (Ice Cube), a child-hating bachelor, who falls for Suzanne but who balks at the prospect of taking on a ready-made family.  Nevertheless, he reluctantly agrees to transport the children from Portland where they live to Vancouver where their mother is attending a convention.  Predictably, the trip turns out  to be a literal hell on wheels for the inexperienced, hapless young man, with the children creating serious havoc both to his person and to his psyche every step of the way.I suppose that small children may enjoy some of the antics contained herein, but no reasonable, thinking adult will derive even the teensiest kernel of enjoyment from this film.  Hampered by its formulaic, cookie cutter plotting, the movie provides little more than an endless stream of inane pratfalls, potty humor and gross out gags, sinking so low as to include a talking bobble head doll and a boxing deer in a desperate effort to obtain laughs.

Brats of unparalleled measure, these kids are sadly typical of the kind of child we often see in movies, tv shows, and even commercials. The all-knowing brash child devils and their hapless parents is a formula that has become standard fare in Hollywood. Since when did children become so smart and parents such fools? As a public school teacher, I can tell you that the attitudes expressed by the children in this movie have spread to children and parents of an entire generation. It isn't a case of the chicken or the egg, I place the blame squarely on Hollywood and its stunningly powerful influence of people. My wife and I both painfully sat through the 95 minutes of hell this movie delivers and actually found ourselves satisfied when the children learn their dad is a big liar. The moment of truth in the movie wherein the viewer is supposed to understand why these hellions are the way they are had the reverse affect for us. We were happy that these horrible characters had finally reaped what they've sown.Reviewers claim that their kids liked it, and perhaps that's the problem.  Children in control, parents floundering and having to endure outright cruel and demented behavior, and a feel-good ending...what kid wouldn't like this? Yet, in an era of overly protective attitudes regarding children, we allow this trash into our living rooms and laugh it up with our kids. There isn't a moment of respect, apology, or even the slightest remorse from these brats, and yet, it all works out well in the end. Life lessons? Given the state of children's behavior today and the utter ignorance and excessive tolerance levels of their parents, (been to a restaurant, shopping center, or playground lately?)

These same two kids again play brother and sister later with Eddie Murphy in Disney's ""The Haunted Mansion.""The script is cliche-ridden and predictable, and the direction is pedestrian at best; however, the film is also enjoyable in spite of these flaws.  We get a typical guy all hot for a woman whom he discovers later has kids that are resentful of anyone trying to take their father's place.  This ""road"" story has Ice Cube, hoping to get in the good graces of the very hot Nia Long, take the kids to see her in Vancouver, Canada where she is working because her lame ex-husband has bailed out on having the kids (again . . . ).  The trio start off hating each other, but end up feeling like a family before all is said and done.Some good moments: the slow, painful distruction of Cube's Lincoln Navigator, the wacko deer, and the good-intentioned, but easily fooled truck driver.

It is not getting any easier. ""Are we there yet"" was yet another movie about and for children that, in my opinion, failed miserably.I think that children (in the audience) like to see children (on the screen) be independent, take charge, and so on. But the writers and directors seem to think that the only way to do this is to take the situation WAY over the top. And by that I don't mean just ""unrealistic"" but viciously unrealistic.Movies can have troubled children as part of the story but to show kids directly causing near manslaughter (or laughing at it when it just happens) is sending a terrible message.Just to keep the bad writing intact, they make the adults as near-morons. If a truck driver seriously thinks children in the adjacent lane are in jeopardy, does he really think that he is ""helping"" by trying to force the car off the road?Children that are 12 years old now are genetically the same as children of a generation or two ago. If they have become jaded and EXPECT this kind of behavior onscreen I blame fully the producers and the writers. And if life imitates art, which seems to be happening, parents might want to take a look at some of these PG movies.The children in this movie are not completely original to this generation. Back in the 50's, Danny Thomas had a TV program ""Make Room for Daddy."" Rusty, his son, talked to his dad in a way that would never have been tolerated in most homes then. But it seems that his personality has been the one to win out in so many movies lately.I'm not saying that the writers have to make clones of Oppie Taylor, the Boxcar Children, or Tom Swift, Jr. But they might want to look into those fictional lives and see how they resolved problems great and small without their causing somebody to fall in a manner that would put that person in a wheel chair for life.

Revolution Films must have thought this could be a great family-oriented film (with the director of two filmed `Flintstones' and `Jungle All the Way'). OK. But if you please, read the following synopsis, and imagine what kind of picture you and your kids will be watching.First meet Ice Cube as Nick, owner of successful sports memorabilia shop. Nick is a avowed child-hater, and ladies' man too. But we are supposed to like him, and surprisingly Ice Cube does the job fairly well. And another romance starts between Nick and Suzanne (Nia Long), single mother, slightly workaholic, who has two children.[THESE KIDS ARE SO...] Now meet the most obnoxious kids in the film's history, Lindsey and Kevin. Now I tell you, these spoiled kids are so determined to do whatever is possible to frustrate the fledging romance involving their mom. So little Lindsey sticks out her tongue, speaks back strongly when spoken to, and never loses chance to humiliate Cube's character verbally while her little brother Kevin is so intent on breaking things, grumbling about everything, and humiliating Ice Cube like his sister.And they must travel 300 miles together for the reasons so contrived and unbelievable that I cannot write it here. All I can say it is not `Planes, Trains & Automobiles.' If I remember correctly, John Candy was never responsible for the total destruction of bran-new SUV, and Steve Martin never fought a deer with bare hands. Remember, Ice Cube fights one, not `hunt'.The kids here are all unlikable, who are having fun playing mischievous pranks on an adult who thinks he had to endure all of them. Their mom is equally off-putting, behaving annoyingly, using her love's heart not to lose her job. But at the end of the journey, there is a predictable and obligatory feel-good moments in which the characters confirm the value of family, and the bond between each other. My advice: avoid it unless you like now clich&eacute;d gross-out gags. Or if you want to teach your kids some effective ways to irritate adults, this is for you. As to the latter purpose, I can be certain of the effects of `Are We There Yet.'.",1,"""Family Picture"" Mostly About Irritating Kids and Silly Recycled Jokes: AVOID IT, Sincerely",1137628800,"01 19, 2006",2006,2287,"['Just', 'Are', 'Yet', 'reached', 'No.1', 'box', 'office', 'gained', 'more', '80,000,000', 'US', ""n't"", 'mean', 'awful', 'film', 'deserves', 'such', 'attention', 'Revolution', 'Films', 'must', 'have', 'thought', 'could', 'be', 'great', 'family-oriented', 'film', 'director', 'two', 'filmed', 'Flintstones', 'Jungle', 'Way', 'OK', 'please', 'read', 'following', 'synopsis', 'imagine', 'what', 'kind', 'picture', 'kids', 'will', 'be', 'watching.First', 'meet', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'Nick', 'owner', 'successful', 'sports', 'memorabilia', 'shop', 'Nick', 'avowed', 'child-hater', 'ladies', 'man', 'too', 'are', 'supposed', 'like', 'surprisingly', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'job', 'fairly', 'well', 'romance', 'Nick', 'Suzanne', 'Nia', 'Long', 'single', 'mother', 'slightly', 'workaholic', 'who', 'two', 'children', '[', 'THESE', 'KIDS', 'ARE', 'SO', ']', 'Now', 'most', 'obnoxious', 'kids', 'film', 'history', 'Lindsey', 'Kevin', 'Now', 'tell', 'spoiled', 'kids', 'are', 'so', 'determined', 'do', 'possible', 'frustrate', 'fledging', 'romance', 'involving', 'mom', 'So', 'little', 'Lindsey', 'sticks', 'out', 'tongue', 'back', 'strongly', 'when', 'spoken', 'never', 'chance', 'humiliate', 'Cube', 'character', 'verbally', 'little', 'brother', 'Kevin', 'so', 'intent', 'breaking', 'things', 'grumbling', 'everything', 'humiliating', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'sister.And', 'must', 'travel', '300', 'miles', 'together', 'reasons', 'so', 'contrived', 'unbelievable', 'can', 'not', 'write', 'here', 'can', 'say', 'not', 'Planes', 'Trains', 'Automobiles', 'remember', 'correctly', 'John', 'Candy', 'was', 'never', 'responsible', 'total', 'destruction', 'bran-new', 'SUV', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'never', 'fought', 'deer', 'bare', 'hands', 'Remember', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'one', 'not', ""hunt'.The"", 'kids', 'here', 'are', 'unlikable', 'who', 'are', 'having', 'fun', 'playing', 'mischievous', 'pranks', 'adult', 'who', 'had', 'endure', 'mom', 'equally', 'off-putting', 'behaving', 'annoyingly', 'using', 'love', 'heart', 'not', 'lose', 'job', 'end', 'journey', 'predictable', 'obligatory', 'feel-good', 'moments', 'characters', 'confirm', 'value', 'family', 'bond', 'other', 'advice', 'avoid', 'like', 'now', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'gross-out', 'gags', 'want', 'teach', 'kids', 'effective', 'ways', 'irritate', 'adults', 'latter', 'purpose', 'can', 'be', 'certain', 'effects', 'Are', 'Yet']",N/A

He runs a successful and highly profitable sports hobby shop.  One day Nick sees a beautiful woman that he almost immediately falls for.  Her name is Suzanne Kingston (Nia Long) and she has all the characteristics of a mate that Nick has been looking for.  However, Nick soon learns that Suzanne is divorced and has two children.  Nick is terrified of children, but he likes Suzanne and is determined to make their relationship work.  The kids, daughter Lindsey (Aleisha Allen) and Kevin (Philip Daniel Bolden), still desperately want their parents to get back together and have done everything in their power to prevent their mom from having a successful relationship with anyone else.  Even though Nick is nicer and more loveable than some of the other prospects, he is NOT an exception to the kids' dislike and they use their full measure of ingenuity to get rid of him.  But it doesn't work because Nick has fallen for Suzanne and vice versa.  Then Suzanne is forced to stay in Vancouver for New Years and asks Nick to bring her the kids so they can be together for the holiday.  The journey becomes a test for the relationship between Nick and Suzanne as well as the turning point between Nick and Lindsey and Kevin.Other than being set in the beautiful Pacific Northwest, ARE WE THERE YET? is a highly derivative film and doesn't really offer anything new to the family road trip subgenre.  There are scenes in the movie that are slightly altered, but have been used before in such films as NATIONAL LAMPOON'S FAMILY VACATION, HOME ALONE, and TOMMY BOY.  Also, it takes awhile for the audience to feel empathetic towards Lindsey and Kevin and the abuse they pour on Nick.  For half of the movie, the children seem completely selfish, uncaring, and downright cruel.Still, even with a fairly weak and derivative script and a couple of self-centered kids, ARE WE THERE YET? works as a family movie.  The movie only has some comical violence, hardly any foul language, and contains an important message about the importance of family, sticking together, and the power of unconditional love.

897018,A2MXTD5CO8SDFE,B000803BQC,U2girl,"[6, 9]","I am so tired of all of these cookie cutter movies and what I mean by that is that they all have the same story and same predictable ending.  The girl is attractive, the girl has kids, the kids don't want mom dating anyone else.  They fight every guy that comes to date mom, but this one guy (Ice Cube) won't go away and then there is some additional drama in between and happily ever after.  Blech!  This movie was just silly.  1/4 of the way through the film I was bored, 1/2 way through the film, I was ready to shut it off, but I figured since I spent 1 hour of my time, I may as well finish it.  This movie was just silly because there is no way on earth that any man would put up with those little whiny brats that long.A good film endears you to the characters that way you can feel their pain and empathize, but these kids were terrible brats from the beginning and I just got more disgusted by their antics as the movie went on.  All the money the man spent on that car and the brat puked all over it and made him run off cliffs, and the deer scene was just ridiculous.Then the girl did a very bleak performance of RESPECT.  Ugh!  The irony of it is that that child had no respect for anyone so she had no business singing a song called RESPECT.  That was so stupid to chose that song for her to sing.I know it sounds like I am on a tirade, but I just can't stand this movie.  It is just one of the worse movies I have spent my time watching.  In my mind I was like ""Is It Over Yet?""  It was not enjoyable and the kids just made me mad cause the things they were doing were just so darn stupid.  I know that in real life, kids do act out but it generally isn't funny when they do it.  It isn't funny in this film either.",1,Blech!,1141171200,"03 1, 2006",2006,1729,"['am', 'so', 'tired', 'cookie', 'cutter', 'movies', 'what', 'mean', 'have', 'same', 'story', 'same', 'predictable', 'ending', 'girl', 'attractive', 'girl', 'kids', 'kids', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'mom', 'dating', 'anyone', 'else', 'fight', 'guy', 'date', 'mom', 'one', 'guy', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'away', 'then', 'additional', 'drama', 'happily', 'ever', 'Blech', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'silly', '1/4', 'way', 'film', 'was', 'bored', '1/2', 'way', 'film', 'was', 'ready', 'shut', 'off', 'figured', 'spent', '1', 'hour', 'time', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'finish', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'silly', 'way', 'earth', 'man', 'would', 'put', 'up', 'little', 'whiny', 'brats', 'long.A', 'good', 'film', 'endears', 'characters', 'way', 'can', 'feel', 'pain', 'empathize', 'kids', 'were', 'terrible', 'brats', 'beginning', 'just', 'got', 'more', 'disgusted', 'antics', 'movie', 'went', 'money', 'man', 'spent', 'car', 'brat', 'puked', 'made', 'run', 'off', 'cliffs', 'deer', 'scene', 'was', 'just', 'ridiculous.Then', 'girl', 'did', 'very', 'bleak', 'performance', 'RESPECT', 'Ugh', 'irony', 'child', 'had', 'respect', 'anyone', 'so', 'had', 'business', 'singing', 'song', 'called', 'RESPECT', 'was', 'so', 'stupid', 'chose', 'song', 'sing.I', 'know', 'am', 'tirade', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'movie', 'just', 'one', 'worse', 'movies', 'have', 'spent', 'time', 'watching', 'mind', 'was', 'Yet', 'was', 'not', 'enjoyable', 'kids', 'just', 'made', 'mad', 'cause', 'things', 'were', 'doing', 'were', 'just', 'so', 'darn', 'stupid', 'know', 'real', 'life', 'kids', 'do', 'act', 'out', 'generally', ""n't"", 'funny', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'funny', 'film']",N/A
