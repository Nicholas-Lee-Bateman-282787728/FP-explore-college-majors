548318,AZ2YLC0GWTAH2,B00004RESR,D.P.,"[2, 2]","More of my ""WCW memories"" here at Slamboree 2000.  Around this time, WCW was revolving around the ""New Blood"" young wrestlers lead by Eric Bischoff & Vince Russo against the ""Millionaries Club"" of established wrestlers.  However during the past month, some of the New Blood members became disgruntled & didn't see eye to eye with Bischoff & Russo so they ended up siding with the Millionaires Club.  The biggest story around this time involved the actor known as David Arquette (who starred in the WCW movie ""Ready To Rumble"" two months earlier) getting involved in the DDP/Jarrett feud which resulted in him winning WCW Championship in a move that backfired so bad that WCW's ratings drop around a million viewers in less than a week & this PPV got one of the worst buyrates in the history of the company.  Keep in mind during this time that WCW instituted a new policy where the referee's ""relaxed"" the disqualification rule so you'll get an ECW-like atmosphere where wrestlers are able to to do more than they can usually get away with as some of the matches heavly showcased.WCW Crusierweight Champion Chris Candido vs. The Artist Formely Known As Prince Iaukea - Pretty good opening match here with Candido taking some good bumps on the outside floor but the bigger story here was the eventual catfight between Tammy & Paisley.WCW Hardcore Champion Terry Funk vs. Norman Smiley & A Mystery Partner - This was a rematch from their Spring Stampede match with the difference being that Norman said he had a mystery parter to help him take care of Terry Funk.  This match was almost an exact copy of their last PPV match (even down to the same opening gag) with both men fighting backstage for most of the match using weapons with the exception that Norman got in more offense than he did last time with the mystery partner just really standing around & having no effect in the match.  They eventually made their way to ringside when the mystery partner was revealed to be Ralphus (Chris Jericho's former bodyguard) with more comedic moments before Funk finally got the win to retain his championship.  This was a very comedic match.Curt Hennig vs. Shawn Stasiak - Shawn Stasiak was doing a copy of Hennig's old ""Mr. Perfect"" gimmick even down to having similar entrance music.  The match itself was average as Hennig made this match better than a normal Stasiak match is before Shawn picked up the win in Hennig's last WCW PPV match as he would leave around a month later.WCW United States Champion Scott Steiner vs. Captain Rection - Earlier, I mentioned that various wrestlers were disgruntled with the direction of the ""New Blood"" and ended up siding with the Millionaries Club.  One of those wrestlers turned out to be the former ""Hugh Morris"" now known as Hugh G. Rection a.k.a. Captain Rection, who also formed an alliance with other disgruntled ex-""New Blood"" members in Chavo Guerrero, Van Hammer, and Lash Leroux...later to be known as the Misfits In Action.  This was a very good match here as Rection was always a very ""underrated"" big man in his career and was able to hold his own very well with Steiner, who's freaks caused an occassional distraction.  In the end, Steiner was able to retain the U.S. Championship before there was a huge brawl between the M.I.A. & security before Booker T came out for the save afterwards.  One moment to look out for was when Rection went for the moonsault but Steiner moved out of the way too late & ended up getting nailed in the back of the head.Chris Kanyon vs. Mike Awesome - I concider this to be the sleeper match of the night as these two wrestlers were heavily underrated as well (Kanyon more than Awesome).  This was both men just wrestling & beating on each other into exaustion with their trademark moves of power moves (Awesome)  & innovative offense (Kanyon) with some ECW elements of a chair & brawling outside coming into play as well.  The ending resulted in a huge brawl between the Millionaries Club & New Blood members but that didn't take away from what was a good contest.Lex Luger vs. Buff Bagwell - The backstory behind this match was that Vince Russo had Ms. Elizabeth, Luger's valet & real life girlfriend, ""held hostage"" because he owned Liz's WCW contract.  This was real better than their lackluster Starrcade '97 match with Buff using various submission & wear down holds against Luger before Liz came out with Russo's bat to help Luger get the victory.  Afterwards, Chuck Palumbo came out to attack Luger (dressed in the same ring gear as Luger to absolute silence from the crowd) & help Bagwell bring Liz back to Russo.As a side note, the aftermath of this match perfectly illistrated one of WCW's major problems that always existed with the company from the start & what made this ""New Blood"" angle not work.  Chuck Palumbo was someone who was never seen or heard from before past WCW Saturday Night (which was the equal to ""WWE's Shotgun Saturday Night"" at that time, nobody watched it when compared to the top shows of Nitro/Thunder) and they all of a sudden expect him to be a legit threat to a main eventer in Lex Luger?  The crowd reaction showcased how that thinking got over.Ric Flair vs. Shane Douglas - This was the match based off Shane Douglas' 7 year hatred towards Ric Flair for feeling like he tried to ruin his career.  Before I get started for those who don't know the story behind this, Douglas was getting a big push in WCW as part of the tag team champions with Ricky Steamboat in a main event feud against the Hollywood Blondes (Steve Austin & Brian Pillman) but when Douglas got injured during the feud, Flair was one of the men in charge of WCW & had Douglas released which Douglas took personally & called Flair out in ECW for years.This was still around the time where Ric Flair was still wrestling in this street clothes (polo shirt, slacks, dress shoes) & the pre-match stipulation was that if Vince Russo got involved (which he promised that he would) then Flair gets 5 mins. with Russo after the match.  The match itself went back & forth and was really good between both men.  However, the ending did show a masked Vince Russo come out to help Douglas get the victory.  Russo tried to run away before Luger threw him back in the ring before the real Vince Russo appeared & helped attack Flair before the masked man revealed himself as David Flair, Ric's son.Sting vs. Vampiro - This was the most ""unique"" feud during the New Blood storyline as this didn't involve Bischoff or Russo as keyplayers in the storyline & took on a dark/gothic twist as well.  Unfortunally, this match didn't live up to the weeks worth of hype between the two as it was very similar to their Spring Stampede match in that it was too short to really become anything special but it was better in that they brawled on the rampway & on the outside and went a little hardcore with bats & pipes being used.Hulk Hogan vs. Billy Kidman with Eric Bischoff as the referee - The Hulk Hogan character at this time was completely different than we've ever seen him before as it Hogan was a ""John Wayne"" type character as it wasn't ""Hulk Hogan"" fighting but Terry Borela fighting for his career and was dressed in his street clothes with ""F.U.N.B."" labeled on the back (The N.B. stood for New Blood, you can figure out for yourself what the F.U. stands for).  Anyways, this was the more most unique Hulk Hogan match you'll ever see as Hogan was more intense than he's known for and with Eric Bischoff as the referee along with the relaxed rules of WCW at this time...it was a glorified hardcore match with chairs & tables being used as Kidman's speed went against Hogan's power.  Again, the most unique Hogan match you've ever seen & I think because of that fact, it was one of Hogan's best during his WCW run.Ready To Rumble Cage Match: WCW Champion David Arquette (still can't believe I just typed that) vs. Diamond Dallas Page vs. Jeff Jarrett - This was a three tear cage with each high level of the cage being smaller than the previous one.  The first one was a cage that not only covered the ring but the outside area as well (similar to WWE's Hell In The Cell) with the next level up being the size of a normal ringsize steel cage with hardcore weapons inside and the final level being a small room with four gutiars hanging inside.  Anyways, I don't want to explain the story behind Arquette being the WCW Champion because I feel so stupid for remembering how it happened so the less said, the better.  Arquette wasn't even a major factor here as Jarrett was chasing him in the beginning only for DDP to catch him & lay into Jarrett while Arquette sayed out of the way & headed to the top of the cage to hold off anyone else from the New Blood getting the belt for Jarrett.  Eventhough DDP & Jarrett have good chemistry together, this match was mostly a brawl with them fighting it out on the first level & getting hardcore on the second level with a scary moment happening when they broke through one of the cage walls.  Mike Awesome interfeared but was taken out by DDP before they went to the third level gutiar room...and had David Arquette hit DDP with a gutiar to help Jarrett win back the WCW Championship with Kaynon coming out in the end to help DDP only for him to take a dive off the top of the cage similar to the one that Mankind took off Hell In The Cell 2 years earlier.  In the history of WCW, they've used this cage structure around 4 times (check out my Listamania to know when) and this was the best match in that enviroment as was actually a very good main event.In the end, this was actually one of WCW's strongest PPV's efforts but will always get overshadowed by the overload of bad & poor booking.  In the end, I would still recommend overall.",4,Great Action Overshadowed By Questionable Booking,1221868800,"09 20, 2008",2008,9750,"['More', 'WCW', 'memories', 'here', 'Slamboree', '2000', 'time',

548319,A1V0898YIRFAS3,B00004RESR,Jose,"[0, 0]","Another event that I was able to find online which was the final Slamboree in WCW's history. During this period, the main feud going on was between the Millionaries Club which was the established veterans (Flair, DDP, Hogan, Sting, Luger, Nash etc) against the New Blood which was the young up and comers (Jarrett, Awesome, Douglas, Kidman, Bagwell etc) lead by Eric Bischoff & Vince Russo. However this event is most remembered for all the wrong reasons as the star of WCW's movie ""Ready To Rumble"" David Arquette was added to the DDP/Jarrett feud that resulted in Arquette actually winning the WCW Championship (not a joke, really did happen). That is where all the negative reaction towards this event comes from but with that being put aside, the undercard was something to see. Also during this time, WCW had a policy in which the disqualification rules would be ""relaxed"" allowing matches to go further than they normally would.WCW Cruiserweight Champion Chris Candido vs The Artist Formely Known as Prince Iaukea. This was a good choice for an opener as the cruiserweights always get a showing going with both men putting on a good performance whether it came to aerial moves or even mat-wrestling but the real highlight here was the catfight between both men's seconds, Tammy (WWF's Sunny) & Paisley (Booker T's wife Sharmell).WCW Hardcore Champion Terry Funk vs Norman Smiley & Mystery Partner. Much like how the WWF was using their Hardcore Championship at the time, WCW was also using it for comedy as this was the rematch from Spring Stampede except this time, Norman would have a partner which turned out to be Chris Jericho's former bodyguard Ralphus. This match went all over the place with so many weapons being used that I wouldn't have time to mention but the funny parts was certainly when Funk was showing Ralphus what it took to be hardcore with even Mark Madden (remember him?) getting in on the fat jokes...even though he was as big as Ralphus.Curt Hennig vs Shawn Stasiak. During this time, Stasiak was being hyped as a sign of perfection by ripping of Curt's WWF gimmick ""Mr. Perfect"" to the point that he used his finisher & similiar entrance music. Hennig shows here why he was one of the best workers in the game as he made Stasiak look better than he ever was in a match that was better than you thought going into it.WCW United States Champion Scott Steiner vs Caption Rection. For those that don't know, Hugh Morris was one of the former members of the New Blood that left due to his disagreement with Russo & Bischoff & formed an alliance with the Millionaries Club along with forming his own group called ""M.I.A.: Misfits In Action"" with members Chavo Guerrero, Van Hammer, Lash Leroxu & even changing his name to Caption Hugh G. Rection. Rection never got much credit in his career for being a good worker as this match showed how talented he was as he held his own against Steiner in a very solid power match with Rection doing moves like a moonsault off the top rope that if you look closely, can see his boots hit Steiner right in the back of the head. The aftermath featured Booker T showing where he stands in this Millionaries/New Blood battle.Mike Awesome vs Chris Kanyon. This was a match that I personally was looking forward to as both men are very underrated performers. Awesome used his mix of high-flying & power offense to keep putting Kanyon down but to no avail as Kanyon just wouldn't quit & was even able to use Awesome's momentum against a couple of times during the bout. The match got more competitive as it went on with a chair being used at times before the match ended up turning into a huge brawl involving members of the Millionaries Club & the New Blood. However for two men that don't get mentioned much for one reason or another, this was a standout match for both men's careers as they put on a great performance.Lex Luger vs Buff Bagwell. During this time, Luger was under a new gimmick named ""The Total Package"" but the story behind this match was that Vince Russo owned Miss Elizabeth (Luger's valet & girlfriend at the time)'s contract & would not allow her to be at the side of Luger. Luger showed his emotional side early as he brought the fight right to Bagwell in the early going with various power moves & taking the action to the outside before Bagwell was able to side-step Luger & begin to use wear down holds to keep Luger on the mat so his power offense wouldn't have an effect. Elizabeth did make her way to the ring by handing Luger a baseball bat allowing Luger to pick up the victory & get Elizabeth back before Chuck Palumbo (dressed in Luger's same attire) came out to attack Luger & help Bagwell bring Liz back to Russo. Even though the aftermath made no sense & was pointless (seriously Chuck Palumbo attacking Luger?), this was a match that I enjoyed more than their previous Starrcade '97 clash as it was never boring & a good match overall.Ric Flair vs Shane Douglas. This was a true grudge match dating back to the years worth of hatred that Douglas had (and still has) for Flair due to Shane being fired back in 1993 after suffering an injury that allowed Douglas to call Flair out for years in ECW. You can sense the tension even in the opening stances as both men ""shoot"" at each other on the mic before the opening bell. Now during this time, Flair was wrestling in dress pants & a shirt since he said it wasn't about wrestling now, it's a street fight along with the added stipulation being that if Vince Russo gets involved in the match (which he said he would) then Flair will get Russo in the ring for five minutes. This was another good match that went back & forth before the ending where a masked man believed to be Russo came to the ring & hit Flair with a bat allowing Douglas to get the win. The aftermath showed that it wasn't Vince Russo but it was Flair's son David Flair who had turned on him before Russo & David just beat Flair down till Kevin Nash & Luger came for the save but it wasn't to be.Sting vs Vampiro. Unlike how the other matches involving the Millionaries Club & the New Blood, this was a feud that had nothing to do with Bischoff or Russo but it took a more dark & mysterious approach. This match didn't last long but it was better than their previous match at Spring Stampede as it was a brawl from the opening with both men using weapons like a steel pipe & a baseball bat before Sting put the final touches on Vampiro in what was an entertaining, albeit short brawl.Hulk Hogan vs Billy Kidman w/Special Referee Eric Bischoff. During this time, Hulk Hogan's character was totally altered in which he wasn't wearing his usual red & yellow outfit or even came into the ring with any wrestling attire as he wrestled in his jeans with a vest that said ""F.U.N.B."", ""NB"" stood for New Blood & I think we all know what the ""FU"" means, brother! With Kidman having Bischoff in his corner as the referee along with the ""relaxed"" rules of WCW at the time, this was basically a hardcore match as Hogan was really aggressive in his power moves to show that he was not out to win but he was out to hurt Kidman while Kidman had to use his speed & quickness along with Bischoff's biasied officating to keep the offense on Hogan. With tables & steel chairs coming into use (including Bischoff taking a sick powerbomb through a table at one point), Hogan overcame all the odds in what was easily one of his best matches in his WCW career.Triple Cage Match: WCW Champion David Arquette (?) vs Diamond Dallas Page vs Jeff Jarrett. Now for those that have never seen or heard of this cage, there are three levels of this structure. The first cage is similiar to a WWE's Hell In A Cell in which the cage also covers the arena floor. The second cage is the size of a regular cage on top with various weapons in it while the third cage is a smaller structure full of guitars with the object being that you need to climb to the top of the three cages & retrieve the belt to win the match. Despite the crap of David Arquette being the champion, he stayed out of the way for the most part despite getting a few hits here & there before climbing to the top of the cage to prevent anyone from getting the belt. From there, DDP & Jarrett just had a brawl with both men going all over the first cage, going into the second level with weapons like a ladder, chair, trash cans, kendo sticks, guitars came into effect with one scary moment being when both men went through one of the fences of the second cage. Mike Awesome would end up getting involved at this point as well but it was what David Arquette did that made the difference as he turned on DDP by hitting with a guitar allowing Jarrett to reclaim the title that lead to Kanyon coming out to DDP's aid before being thrown off the top of the cage onto the entrance stage to end the night. Again, other than Arquette being in the match as champion, this was a solid main event with a twist finish.In the end, this was one of those WCW cards where the in-ring action was actually very solid from top to bottom without a bad match but the only thing that holds this event back is the various poor booking decisions that were done. If you can get pass all that, this is one WCW card that I recommend taking a look at.",4,Triple Cage Madness,1298419200,"02 23, 2011",2011,9265,"['event', 'was', 'able', 'find', 'online', 'was',
