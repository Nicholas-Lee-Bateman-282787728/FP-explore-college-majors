1103753,A3T0OTH5072YRE,B000VQYDJM,"M. Reynard ""kairosdreaming""","[0, 0]","So I'm a pretty big fan of this series.  I like the characters, the search for justice, and the fact that there is hope for victims out there.  All these serve to make this particular flavor of Law & Order the only one I like, as I tend to avoid the original or Criminal Intent.  For those not familiar with Law and Order SVU, it deals with the tough crimes, rape, child abuse, and elder abuse.  And also, if you're not familiar with it, go start at the first season!Season Four is of course the fourth year in the series.  There is somewhat of a timeline although some of the extended plots that go through the seasons are largely ignored in this season.  We don't get much of the detectives personal lives so there is no story arc there.  But each episode is its own complete story, and they serve ok on their own.Season Four has twenty five episodes.  And not all of these episodes are all that great.  If fact, there were several that I fell asleep through as they just didn't keep my interest.  Now I have seen all of these before, so that could be part of the problem, but really, I haven't has as much trouble with that on the first three season.  I think that maybe these just weren't as interesting or imaginative and that the characters just weren't up to their usual stellar performances.  I did enjoy the Episode ""Tortured"" as it brought up some issues that happen in other countries and the difference between the USA and other governments on how they are handled.  Likewise, ""Angels"" was heartbreaking and had a very good child actor in it.  However, those episodes that put me to sleep were ""Appearances"" about the child pageant industry and ""Futility"".  They weren't bad episodes per say, but especially with Pageant, it felt a little contrived.Characters:Christopher Meloni: Elliot StablerMariska Hargitay: Olivia BensonRichard Belzer: John MunchIce-T: Fin TutuolaStephanie March: Alexandra CabotB.D. Wong: George HuangDan Florek: Captain CragenWhile Meloni and Hargitay were their usual brilliant selves, I have to say I was quite disappointed to see that Belzer and Ice-T featured only rarely in this season.  Ice-T more so than Belzer even, and that's not saying much.  I really enjoy the episodes with them in it but apparently they were busy, because they just weren't around too much.  And Meloni and Hargitay are good, but I do like to see a little variance here and there.  On a good note though, there was quite a bit of March and Wong in this season.  I like the added elements they give playing the ADA and psychiatrist as it gives yet another look at the crime and helps you to analyze different details of the case.  There are so many actors that play in this type of show that it really is nice to have a set cast that you can count on to be in almost every episode and it ties together the different seasons.Still a very good show and while this may not be the most spectacular of seasons, it is still worth watching if you're a fan.  I'll be moving right along to the fifth season myself.Review by M.
