If you're a fan of Frank's CD release, you'll have heard about 80% of this act. It's kind of sad that he's had years between that CD and this release, but he hasn't come up with much new material. Brian Regan and Jeff Dunham have released 2 DVDs in the past two years and come up with completely new acts.What little new material that is there is funny at times. Absolutely the standout moment in the show is a part of the bonus materials. It's an encore presentation in which Frank does a Jonathan Winters impression that is absolutely hilarious and spot-on. Then it's back to his standard ""Chris Farley is Batman"" closer.The bonus materials on the DVD are the encore, a quick look at some of the makeup work on him, some spots with him doing John Madden out in different places, and a short blooper reel.If you have Frank's CD, you can skip this. If this is your first introduction to his work, it's funny.",3,Funny but familiar,1223078400,"10 4, 2008",2008,1016,"['Frank', 'funny', 'guy', 'lot', 'voices', 'unfortunately', 'routine', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', 'much', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Frank', 'CD', 'release', ""'ll"", 'have', 'heard', '80', '%', 'act', 'kind', 'sad', 'had', 'years', 'CD', 'release', ""n't"", 'come', 'up', 'much', 'new', 'material', 'Brian', 'Regan', 'Jeff', 'Dunham', 'have', 'released', '2', 'DVDs', 'past', 'two', 'years', 'come', 'up', 'completely', 'new', 'acts.What', 'little', 'new', 'material', 'funny', 'times', 'Absolutely', 'standout', 'moment', 'show', 'part', 'bonus', 'materials', 'encore', 'presentation', 'Frank', 'Jonathan', 'Winters', 'impression', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'spot-on', 'Then', 'back', 'standard', 'Chris', 'Farley', 'Batman', 'closer.The', 'bonus', 'materials', 'DVD', 'are', 'encore', 'quick', 'look', 'makeup', 'work', 'spots', 'doing', 'John', 'Madden', 'out', 'different', 'places', 'short', 'blooper', 'reel.If', 'have', 'Frank', 'CD', 'can', 'skip', 'first', 'introduction', 'work', 'funny']",All Over The Place Amaray

1176061,A3IKBHODOTYYHM,B001CDL6QG,"fra7299 ""fra7299""","[3, 3]","Funny for what it is, a nonstop impression marathon. I appreciate and enjoy Frank Caliendo's brand of humor, and his ability to take on so many different roles is amazing. However, as one reviewer mentioned, one of the problems with this particular show is that if you've seen Caliendo on television, then most of this stuff won't surprise you. You'll still probably get some laugh out loud moments, but some of the bits and gags get a bit repetitive (he goes back to Bill Clinton and George W. Bush again and again), and, as the title alludes to, Caliendo doesn't have any real direction in this act, but seems to be ""all over the place."" Still, it is worth the viewing just to see the repertoire of characters he can impersonate: Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, John Madden,  Charles Barkley, Adam Sandler, Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Dr. Phil, Jerry Seinfeld. I thought his best bits were the impressions of John Madden, and his football analysis. He even has some lesser known talents in there too.  Over all, better than average but there is probably some funnier Caliendo stand up out there.3  stars",3,Worth a viewing,1266537600,"02 19, 2010",2010,1102,"['Funny', 'what', 'nonstop', 'impression', 'marathon', 'appreciate', 'enjoy', 'Frank', 'Caliendo', 'brand', 'humor', 'ability', 'take', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'roles', 'amazing', 'However', 'one', 'reviewer', 'mentioned', 'one', 'problems', 'particular', 'show', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Caliendo', 'television', 'then', 'most', 'stuff', 'wo', ""n't"", 'surprise', ""'ll"", 'still', 'probably', 'get', 'laugh', 'loud', 'moments', 'bits', 'gags', 'get', 'bit', 'repetitive', 'back', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'again', 'again', 'title', 'Caliendo', ""n't"", 'have', 'real', 'direction', 'act', 'be', 'place', 'Still', 'viewing', 'just', 'see', 'repertoire', 'characters', 'can', 'impersonate', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'John', 'Madden', 'Charles', 'Barkley', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'Dr.', 'Phil', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'thought', 'best', 'bits', 'were', 'impressions', 'John', 'Madden', 'football', 'analysis', 'even', 'lesser', 'known', 'talents', 'there', 'too', 'better', 'average', 'probably', 'funnier', 'Caliendo', 'stand', 'up', 'out', 'there.3', 'stars']",All Over The Place Amaray

Frank's impressions are as realistic as they get.  I don't know many people who can do a dead on impression of George Bush and John Madden and have practically the same mannerisms.  This is not only a hilarious DVD, but this also proves that comedians can be funny without being obnoxiously raunchy.
