The white ghost was about scariness, but the black ghost was more of plot and development, which really didn't work too well, but didn't pull the movie down.  When it comes to plot and development, for all 3 movies put together, I give it a C+, but scariness I give an A+ for, that movie didn't fail to impress for the first half when the white ghost was still taking victims.  The black ghost had 3 scary moments maximum, but a bit more plot and development (as already mentioned).Like the other 2 movies, I'm giving this one a 5/5, not too much to talk about except for how weird the first part is, so I might as well keep that a secret until the movie is watched.

1422711,AXYEW4EJR2BIA,B004O63TRW,"Jonathan ""cinematicaddiction&#8228;com""","[1, 2]","Ju-on: White Ghost and Black Ghost are the continuation of the Ju-on franchise, although they are not directly related to the original installments. White Ghost tells of a young man that brutally murders his family, then kills himself; Black Ghost tells of a young girl who, after fainting and receiving several medical tests, finds out she has a cyst in her body, which is actually her twin sister. The stories are a bit more complicated, but I'll leave it at that. Ju-on: White Ghost/Black Ghost is a creepy and effective horror film.The stories in this film use the same formula as the original films; it uses creepy visuals, eerie sounds (the iconic croaking sounds makes a return), and loud jump-scares to create an effective horror atmosphere/mood. Additionally, this is the most violent and disturbing entry in the series- from the brutal stabbings to the implied pedophilia. After the recent disappointing entries in this franchise (ahem, The Grudge 2 and 3), the return to the original formula is welcomed. The storytelling is still a bit confusing- it really leaves you asking questions until the end, as the film skips around from character to character; part of me enjoys the direct focus on a specific character's story, but it feels a bit sloppy or overly complicated. I think the storytelling issue will be a more significant to those that aren't familiar with this style. The acting was good throughout the film, about what you'd expect from a low budget j-horror film.I own the Blu-ray of this film. Both films run at about an hour each, and both share the same disc. The Blu-ray picture and sound quality is fine, basically standard. The film has English subtitles, it does not have an English dub. The blu-ray does not have special features.Overall, Ju-on: White Ghost/Black Ghost is a creepy, unsettling j-horror film, and a great return to what made the originals iconic. The Blu-ray version of this film isn't a must own, unless your a blu-ray collector. A purchase is recommended for fans of the genre and franchise, a rental otherwise.This film has strong violence and gore.",4,A Creepy and Effective Horror Film...

1422714,A2U93J8VKKE1JV,B004O63TRW,"Thomas Reifenberg ""8BitRockMan""","[1, 1]","I don't think my review can do it justice, I say pick it up and watch it for yourself, anyway, here is what I originally wrote on another site:So, I FINALLY got this movie and I thought it was actually pretty good. There were some minor flaws, but excusable because I think this movie didn't have a high budget, but pretty good entertainment. I picked it up for around $10, definitely a movie I will revisit a few times. The scare factor was there and the camera work made the scare effects work. If the cameraman didn't know what he/she was doing, this movie would not have worked. The Grudge appears many times through the movie, however when you see it, you get just enough to know what is happening. I like how many of the scenes let you know exactly what is going to happen with the proper props. You get to see almost every murder take place, the ones that I consider quite gruesome are shown by the camera moving away from the action and you see what is happening by the movement of the shadows or just enough that you can see an act take place, but will not get disgusted. So, if you have a light stomach for that kind of thing, this movie is definitely good for you if you want to watch a scary movie, but not get grossed out like many American movies do. It seems like the whole movie was filmed raw with very little special effects, so blood shown is accurate by having a few spots here and there where in many Hollywood scary movies people tend to bleed way too much from a paper cut or something silly. The main thing I thought was clever about this movie is that it was shot from many different perspectives and the viewer gets to piece things together as you watch it. In White Ghost for example, you see from a perspective of what seems to be a minor character, but actually has a big reference in the end. As the movie progresses, the perspectives you get directly involve more and closer to The Grudge character. I must say, I was not expecting what I saw in the end. For Black Ghost, I thought it was just a good piece of entertainment. The only thing that would have been nice was is if they had done more with The Grudge character as the black ghost. She appears enough so you know she is there and directly involves with the characters of the film. I don't know, they have this spectacular character to work with, great back story, but wasn't used enough. Black Ghost is basically what The Unborn could have been if The Unborn was actually a good, non-self contradicting movie (based on what my little brother said when he saw it in the theaters, I didn't watch it, but that was his take on it). Final plus point on this movie compared to American scary movies, the characters in the movie are not completely stupid like in many American scary movies. An example would be in American movies, they know they need to flee for their lives because of zombies or a curse or whatever following them, but wait, minor character leaves some pointless object he/she can easily live without, but go back to get it anyway and die. In this movie, the characters may not be aware of The Grudge's existence around them, but don't make stupid mistakes.I say definitely give this movie a chance if you don't have a problem reading subtitles and don't mind lower budget films. Also, I wouldn't categorize this movie under horror, I would put it under suspense/thriller.Also, as a bonus, they make a few references to the original Ju-On movies, see if you can spot them. The weird white/cat/ghost baby character from Ju-On... 1...? is in the movie, but seems to play no major role and is only in it for a few seconds in both films.*About this film's rating, in America, it is not rated, but would probably be PG-13 or R, in Canada, it is rated 14+, in Japan, it is rated R-15, in Korea, it is rated 18+, and as far as Europe goes, I found no information as it may never have been released there. I suggest the audience be at least 16 or older to watch this movie. This language is Japanese 5.1 DTS and Japanese 2.0 Stereo. The subtitles for this particular version is English only or no subtitles. There are no other subtitles languages, sadly, it didn't even have Japanese subtitles.*EDIT: I have a friend in Tokyo who I will discuss this movie further and others in the series to see if their are some cultural differences other nationalities like Americans may not get and post what I find out about here.",5,I haven't seen anything quite like this!
