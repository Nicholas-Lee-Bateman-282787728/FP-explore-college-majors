309201,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6302375827,Acute Observer,"[1, 6]","There is an outdoor scene in Scotland. Artist Jeffrey is sketching Sally. A sudden rain causes them to seek shelter. A letter falls, and is found by Sally. She learns about Jeffrey Carroll's wife and child. Sally can never marry him now. Jeffrey stops at a chemist before returning home. His daughter Bea is quite precocious and perfect. Then its two years later. The first Mrs. Carroll is long dead, and Sally is the new Mrs. Carroll! Mr. Charles Pennington brings along Mrs. Latham and her daughter Cecily (who wants her portrait painted). We see that the chemist Blagdon out in the road waiting for Jeffrey.There is a local horse race and they all attend. [We learn about their culture.] Mr. Carroll pays a large amount to the chemist who sold him something he had to sign for. The second Mrs. Carroll now suffers form an illness. Her doctor Tuttle says she's doing well, ""its just nerves"". Cecily Latham drops by to tell Jeffrey she will be going abroad. A creditor calls Jeffrey and presses him for money. [We see a hidden facet of Jeffrey's character.] Bea tells Sally about the health of her late mother. She also knows about Mr. Blagdon. Sally know realizes what her problem is. And in London Jeffrey fixes his problem with Mr. Blagdon.The guests arrive for a dinner party. Sally is ill, Jeffrey returns very late. The guests leave during a rainy night. Jeffrey brings some milk to Sally, but Sally's taste has changed. Jeffrey decides to fix another problem. But fate intervenes and provides an ending that is happy for some.[This film was taken from a stage play. The fascination with murder (for sex or money or both) provides popular entertainment in England. Is this because of their censorship?]",2,Portrait of the Artist as a Widower,1172620800,"02 28, 2007",2007,1709,"['outdoor', 'scene', 'Scotland', 'Artist', 'Jeffrey', 'sketching', 'Sally', 'sudden', 'rain', 'seek', 'shelter', 'letter', 'found', 'Sally', 'Jeffrey', 'Carroll', 'wife', 'child', 'Sally', 'can', 'never', 'marry', 'now', 'Jeffrey', 'chemist', 'returning', 'home', 'daughter', 'Bea', 'quite', 'precocious', 'perfect', 'Then', 'two', 'years', 'later', 'first', 'Mrs.', 'Carroll', 'long', 'dead', 'Sally', 'new', 'Mrs.', 'Carroll', 'Mr.', 'Charles', 'Pennington', 'Mrs.', 'Latham', 'daughter', 'Cecily', 'who', 'portrait', 'painted', 'see', 'chemist', 'Blagdon', 'out', 'road', 'waiting', 'Jeffrey.There', 'local', 'horse', 'race', 'attend', '[', 'learn', 'culture', 'Mr.', 'Carroll', 'large', 'amount', 'chemist', 'who', 'sold', 'something', 'had', 'sign', 'second', 'Mrs.', 'Carroll', 'now', 'form', 'illness', 'doctor', 'Tuttle', 'doing', 'well', 'just', 'nerves', 'Cecily', 'Latham', 'drops', 'tell', 'Jeffrey', 'will', 'be', 'going', 'abroad', 'creditor', 'Jeffrey', 'money', 'see', 'hidden', 'facet', 'Jeffrey', 'character', ']', 'Bea', 'Sally', 'health', 'late', 'mother', 'also', 'Mr.', 'Blagdon', 'Sally', 'know', 'what', 'problem', 'London', 'Jeffrey', 'fixes', 'problem', 'Mr.', 'Blagdon.The', 'arrive', 'dinner', 'party', 'Sally', 'ill', 'Jeffrey', 'very', 'late', 'guests', 'leave', 'rainy', 'night', 'Jeffrey', 'milk', 'Sally', 'Sally', 'taste', 'changed', 'Jeffrey', 'fix', 'problem', 'fate', 'intervenes', 'ending', 'happy', '[', 'film', 'was', 'taken', 'stage', 'play', 'fascination', 'murder', 'sex', 'money', 'popular', 'entertainment', 'England', 'censorship', ']']",N/A
309202,A3IRBCCB3I5PPD,6302375827,"Anastasia McPherson ""Bibliophile""","[1, 2]","My son and I were on a Film Noir Binge over the holiday and this was one of the offerings we perused. The two Mrs. Carrolls is solid and entertaining - not a classic, but a lot of watchable fun nevertheless. It is hard to say a bad word about a movie that features not only Humphrey Bogart and Barbara Stanwyck, but several great American and British character actors of the time.Bogart is an artist who marries his muses. When we meet him, he is on an adulterous vacation with Stanwyck, the problem being that she doesn't know she is the other woman. She leaves him in a fit of tears and in another world, that would have been the end of it. But Carroll needs the inspiration that Stanwyck provides for his painting. His mysteriously sickly wife isn't quite doing the job - but she has one more painting in her, the beautiful and disturbing Angel of Death that is featured heavily in the film.After the death of the first Mrs. Carroll, Bogart reunites with Stanwyck and we next see them married and living the life of landed gentry in an English manor house. Paintings of Stanwyck have joined the Angel of Death and they are to all appearances deliriously happy. But Carroll isn't painting as well as he used to and isn't selling what he did paint.What happens next is predictable and that is my main criticism of the movie. Too much is telegraphed to the viewer far too early. Nor is the red herring even remotely believable. The prodigious talents of Bogart and Stanwyck and the rest of the cast have to carry a script that is weak in terms of mystery and suspense. For a movie that is a mystery and a thriller in the noir tradition, this is a genuine weakness.That said, this is a solid film and worth watching, especially for fans of the silver screen and the stars and character actors involved. Final grade, solid but not spectacular, despite all of the star power involved.",4,Great A- to B+ Film Representative of the Era's Noir,1390953600,"01 29, 2014",2014,1881,"['son', 'were', 'Film', 'Noir', 'Binge', 'holiday', 'was', 'one', 'offerings', 'perused', 'two', 'Mrs.', 'Carrolls', 'solid', 'entertaining', 'not', 'classic', 'lot', 'watchable', 'fun', 'nevertheless', 'hard', 'say', 'bad', 'word', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'several', 'great', 'American', 'British', 'character', 'actors', 'time.Bogart', 'artist', 'who', 'muses', 'When', 'meet', 'adulterous', 'vacation', 'Stanwyck', 'problem', 'being', ""n't"", 'know', 'other', 'woman', 'fit', 'tears', 'world', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'end', 'Carroll', 'inspiration', 'Stanwyck', 'painting', 'mysteriously', 'sickly', 'wife', ""n't"", 'quite', 'doing', 'job', 'one', 'more', 'painting', 'beautiful', 'disturbing', 'Angel', 'Death', 'featured', 'heavily', 'film.After', 'death', 'first', 'Mrs.', 'Carroll', 'Bogart', 'Stanwyck', 'next', 'see', 'married', 'living', 'life', 'landed', 'gentry', 'English', 'manor', 'house', 'Paintings', 'Stanwyck', 'have', 'joined', 'Angel', 'Death', 'are', 'appearances', 'deliriously', 'happy', 'Carroll', ""n't"", 'painting', 'as', 'well', 'used', ""n't"", 'selling', 'what', 'did', 'paint.What', 'next', 'predictable', 'main', 'criticism', 'movie', 'Too', 'much', 'telegraphed', 'viewer', 'far', 'too', 'early', 'red', 'herring', 'even', 'remotely', 'believable', 'prodigious', 'talents', 'Bogart', 'Stanwyck', 'rest', 'cast', 'have', 'carry', 'script', 'weak', 'terms', 'mystery', 'suspense', 'movie', 'mystery', 'thriller', 'noir', 'tradition', 'genuine', 'said', 'solid', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'especially', 'fans', 'silver', 'screen', 'stars', 'character', 'actors', 'involved', 'Final', 'grade', 'solid', 'not', 'spectacular', 'star', 'power', 'involved']",N/A

While this movie smacks of a formula Warner Brothers movie (which isn't all that bad for me since I like most of the stuff Warners produced in the '30's and '40's), the script is good but the acting is just plain great. Stanwyk does a great job of slowly coming to the realization that Bogart is not just evil but plain darn crazy as well. Bogart, for his part, peels back the artist husband's rational persona and exposes a menacing and insane man who is loosing his battle with sanity. Foreshadowing his future character Captain Queeg, Bogart lets it rip with a crazy turn at the end of the movie which is as terrifying to the viewer as it is to his movie wife Stanwyk.

I can't believe he was recently voted # 1 on that list of all-time-male actors. (And all because of you-know-what.) Mainly my lack of enthusiasm  for him, comes from when he back in '39 starred in &quot;The Return Of  Dr.X&quot;; proclaiming it was one of those dreadful Horror films usually  starring Boris Karloff or Bela Lugosi. That made me mad; both those actors  were a million times better, and more versatile. Nevertheless, he's very  effective as the crazed husband in this one. The rest of the cast is fine,  too. (Stanwyck always is, ofcourse.) But the one to look out for here, is  really young Ann Carter as the daughter. She was so good in producer Val  Lewton's &quot;Curse Of The Cat People&quot;, which was directed by Robert  Wise. (A title  sadly deleted.) I think she's the best child actress ever;  too bad she stopped relatively early, and didn't continue acting. She was a  natural talent, and no doubt could've gone far and be more known today.

309218,A152C8GYY25HAH,6302375827,Matthew Horner,"[17, 18]","""The Two Mrs. Carrolls"" may not be one of the great melodramas from 1940s Hollywood, but it is a fine example of the craftsmanship that went into studio pictures in those days. Its primary importance in film history is that this is the only pairing of Humphrey Bogart and Barbara Stanwyck. While Stanwyck is superb, Bogart, I'm afraid, acts like he is only going through the motions, perhaps because this is what would have been considered a `woman's picture' back then. [Compare this to his amazing performance the next year in the manly ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre""]When the movie opens, Geoffrey Carroll [Bogart] is seen fishing with Sally [Stanwyck] in Scotland. They've recently met and are in love. When she accidentally discovers that he is married, she ends the affair. In despair, Geoffrey goes home to his wife and daughter in London. The story suddenly shifts forward a couple of years. We find out that the first Mrs. Carroll died, and now Geoffrey and Sally are married. They live a seemingly idyllic life in the country, until Geoffrey meets Cecily, played by a ravishingly beautiful Alexis Smith. For a time, Sally is clueless, but when questions about how Geoffrey's first wife died, Sally finally suspects what we already know: There is  something very wrong with her husband and her marriage.The story is somewhat absurd, but no one could play a victim, innocent or otherwise, better than Stanwyck, as she was to prove a year later in ""Sorry, Wrong Number"".

However, Bogart overacted and mugged so terribly for the camera - his exaggerated hand gestures, in particular, are annoying - that the movie is laughable. In fact, it was laughed off the screen when it was released in 1947, two years after filming was completed. I can't imagine what was going on in his mind when he filmed this movie. Stanwyck, professional and committed to perfection once she agreed to appear in a movie, almost certainly regretted starring in this one. This was one of those &quot;stinkers&quot; she referred to in an interview later in her life....still, if only for her acting and for the cliche' atmospherics in the film - which includes endlessly chiming church bells that would drive ANYONE mad, gloomy English rain, the overbearing maid who insults everyone, and a house that looks as if it was decorated with Dracula in mind, it's worth seeing, at least once. Nigel Bruce overacts terribly as the whiskey-loving doctor who attributes every illness to &quot;nerves.&quot; And the final confrontation between Bogart and Stanwyck, when Bogart enters Stanwyck's locked bedroom through a second-story window, in the rain, his face lighted from underneath somehow so that he looks extremely confused, almost embarrassed - and certainly not ghoulish, as I'm sure he was intended to, is hilarious. If you weren't laughing before, you'll laugh at this scene. It would have been interesting to see Stanwyck and Bogart reunited in a better movie. They might have had an interesting chemistry. I would love to have seen Stanwyck in a role with Bogart that would have displayed her strength and toughness. See this movie, at least once.

The problem isn't the acting or (in my opinion) the casting, but the clunky script.  In the opening scene, Sally accidentally learns that new flame Gerry is married when (*clears throat for comic effect*) a letter to ""Mrs. Carroll"" falls out of his pocket.  Swearing to never see Gerry again, Sally runs off into the rain, only to turn up married to Gerry three scenes later, after wife number one is dead.  From there, the turns of plot become ever more convenient and clich&eacute;d, and yet somehow less logical at the same time.  The script both swills in extraneous information and leaves too much unexplained, and the film overall is like a clothesline, with the plot points hung on awkwardly at predictable intervals.But if there were ever two stars that could save bad material, it was Bogart and Stanwyck.  Bogie made the choppy, incoherent character Gerry come out to more than the sum of his parts.

309227,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,6302375827,Simon Davis,"[39, 39]","I've always been intrigued by ""The Two Mrs. Carrolls"" and always feel it is a far better film than how it is always judged. The film has a polished look to it and contains a suspenceful story that really keeps you on the edge of your seat, particulary in the second half.Certainly ""The Two Mrs. Carrolls"" is no ""Casablanca"" or ""The Maltese Falcon"" (but lets face it how many films like that come along in any actors career anyway?) but I feel from repeated screenings of it that it is a most interesting vechicle for Bogart in particular. He plays a character very different from his usual type of personas. I dont see that as a bad thing at all and I feel his craggy looks and dark demeanour are absolutely perfect for the role of Geoffrey Carroll,  a psychotic artist who paints portraits of his wives (hence the title) as the Angel of Death and then murders them. His pairing with Barbara Stanwyck is an original and fascinating one which sadly was never repeated but I feel, also contrary to critics belief that they team very well together. Barbara also takes a different stance in this film playing a nice girl who marries Geoffrey for all the right reasons only to discover the dark truth of the man she thought she knew when it is almost too late. Barbara has a sympathetic role here and she performs to her always high standard. She was always excellent as the heroine under threat and she beautifully modulates her performance here, moving from being an inlove new bride to someone witnessing a frightening chain of events that make her fear for her own life . The tension between the two once Sally (Stanwyck) begins to realise what is going on in Geoffrey's mind is the basis for the suspence that occurs in the story. Alexis Smith also scores (no mean task when up against Bogart and Stanwyck)in the role of the slinky and bitchy Cecily Latham who tries to come between Geoffrey and Sally. The scene at the afternoon tea in the Carroll's garden is very funny in a sarcastic kind of way and she is perfect as the femme fatale of the story.The set up  look of this film also adds greatly to its suspense element. The constant chiming of the towns Church Bells, the constant inclement weather through most of the second half as the tension rises, and  the dark sombre house really create the right atmosphere of impending doom. Peter Godfrey directed this film and was responsible for guiding Barbara Stanwyck through some interesting and diverse roles like ""Cry Wolf"" and ""Christmas in Connecticut"" two of my personal favourites of Stanwyck's work. While not the greatest director at Warner Bros Godfrey here directs with a sure hand and keeps the action bubbling along to the climax of the story.The other supporting players are also well chosen with the ever reliable Nigel Bruce playing his usual bumbling character, in this case the local doctor Dr. Tuttle who finds himself having to treat Sally for a mysterious ""illness' which in reality is Geoffrey trying to slowly poison her. Young Anne Carter really impresses in the role of Geoffrey's strangely mature daughter Beatrice by his first wife. Patrick O'Moore is also excellent as Charles Pennington, ""Penny"" a former love of Sally's who begins to suspect that all is not well in the Carroll household.As stated previously the last 30 minutes of the film as Sally begins to suspect Geoffrey's motives and tries to outsmart him are the best in the whole film. It is real nail biting action as Barbara tries to outwit her husband while not letting him know she is on to him. This occurs  in the midst of a violent storm once everyone else is out of the house. The scenes where Geoffrey finally loses his mind in homicidal rage and sets out to murder Sally are harrowing to witness and I feel Bogart handles this difficult piece of acting perfectly making Geoffrey a truly terrifing character.""The Two Mrs. Carrolls"" while not a great success on release is a film worth viewing. It certainly contains good work by both stars and is among my favourite Stanwyck performances.

309228,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,6302375827,Turfseer,"[2, 3]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***When it was released in 1947, one reviewer called 'The Two Mrs. Carrolls', a ""dreadful adaptation of a derivative stage play."" In part, that pretty much sums it up. It did very poorly at the box office despite starring Humphrey Bogart, who was totally miscast as an artist bent on doing in successive wives, a la Bluebeard. There were also hints of 'The Picture of Dorian Gray', when he paints portraits of both wives as an 'Angel of Death' , before poisoning the first and almost poisoning a second.There is very little mystery here because it's established at the get go that Bogart as Geoffrey Carroll, the psychopathic artist, has already murdered his first wife and plans to do in his second, Sally, played rather perfunctorily by Barbara Stanwyck. The only thing we're waiting for is how Geoffrey intends to bump off Sally and how she manages to avoid becoming his victim.The biggest problem with the script is that Geoffrey is such an unsavory character and has no charm. Good thrillers have murderers with a human face. Here, perhaps because of when the original source material was written (as a play in 1935), often the bad guy intentionally is drawn as thoroughly detestable. Fortunately, in the 1930s, certain talented novelists began to buck that trend (such as Raymond Chandler and James M. Cain) and by the 40s, some superior noirs were produced ('Double Indemnity' for example, which featured the charming killer, Walter Neff, played by Fred MacMurray).Here, Bogart has little to do, except act surly through most of the narrative. A savvy killer will make ordinary folk feel comfortable, so they're unable to suspect he's up to no good. But good old Geoffrey can hardly contain his contempt when he's introduced to Sally's ex, 'Penny' and his friends, the Lathams, at the luncheon gathering. One just wonders what Geoffrey's 'problem' is overall. Is he a creepy misogynist or simply someone who is desperate to maintain his 'lap of luxury' lifestyle at any cost? One thing is for sure: he doesn't know how to handle himself very well, when dealing with blackmailers. How is it that control freak Geoffrey is unable to keep the weak chemist, Blagdon, in check? And then Mr. Carroll has to resort to murdering him, when I'm sure there's a whole paper trail, linking the mad artist, to the purchases of all that poison he's been pouring into his dear wife Sally's milk!Alexis Smith who plays the cold, steely Cecily, probably gives the best performance in the film. But what exactly does she see in the mega- creepy Geoffrey, that she wants to go to bed with him? (of course we never see that--but it's implied!). As for Sally--when she learns definitively that Geoffrey intends to do her in, after seeing her own 'Angel of Death' portrait, why does she dither around so much, that it gives Geoffrey time to get back home? It appears we're asked to accept the idea that Mrs. Carroll is so devastated by her husband's betrayal, that she becomes despondent and paralyzed, that she can't bring herself to get out of that house right away!During most of the film, Stanwyck plays Sally has a bland, goody two- shoes, who merely shows up as Bogie's proverbial punching back. More enigmatic is the child actress, Ann Carter, who is eerily good as the precocious daughter. Has she been corrupted by her demented father? In the end, I believe she ends up undamaged, despite what's she's been put through by the creepy father.'The Two Mrs. Carrolls' manages to remain only mildly interesting. There's an ordinary story here that chugs along, but there's virtually no suspense and Bogart is oh so wrong for the part. If you have nothing to do on a dreary, rainy Saturday, then by all means, take a look. But this shouldn't even be on your next hundred list, to break out of your DVD rack, or select from your almost filled DVR.",2,"'Bluebeard' meets 'The Picture of Dorian Gray', in this miscast Bogie vehicle",1382572800,"10 24, 2013",2013,3870,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***When', 'was', 'released', '1947', 'one', 'reviewer', 'called', ""'The"", 'Two', 'Mrs.', 'Carrolls', 'dreadful', 'adaptation', 'derivative', 'stage', 'play', 'part', 'pretty', 'much', 'sums', 'up', 'did', 'very', 'poorly', 'box', 'office', 'starring', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'who', 'was', 'totally', 'miscast', 'artist', 'bent', 'doing', 'successive', 'wives', 'la', 'Bluebeard', 'were', 'also', 'hints', ""'The"", 'Picture', 'Dorian', 'Gray', 'when', 'portraits', 'wives', ""'Angel"", 'Death', 'poisoning', 'first', 'almost', 'poisoning', 'second.There', 'very', 'little', 'mystery', 'here', 'established', 'get', 'go', 'Bogart', 'Geoffrey', 'Carroll', 'psychopathic', 'artist', 'already', 'murdered', 'first', 'wife', 'plans', 'do', 'second', 'Sally', 'played', 'rather', 'perfunctorily', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'only', 'thing', ""'re"", 'waiting', 'how', 'Geoffrey', 'bump', 'off', 'Sally', 'how', 'avoid', 'becoming', 'victim.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'script', 'Geoffrey', 'such', 'unsavory', 'character', 'charm', 'Good', 'thrillers', 'have', 'murderers', 'human', 'face', 'Here', 'perhaps', 'when', 'original', 'source', 'material', 'was', 'written', 'play', '1935', 'often', 'bad', 'guy', 'intentionally', 'drawn', 'thoroughly', 'detestable', 'Fortunately', '1930s', 'certain', 'talented', 'novelists', 'began', 'buck', 'trend', 'such', 'Raymond', 'Chandler', 'James', 'M.', 'Cain', '40s', 'superior', 'noirs', 'were', 'produced', ""'Double"", 'Indemnity', 'example', 'featured', 'charming', 'killer', 'Walter', 'Neff', 'played', 'Fred', 'MacMurray', '.Here', 'Bogart', 'little', 'do', 'act', 'surly', 'most', 'narrative', 'savvy', 'killer', 'will', 'make', 'ordinary', 'folk', 'feel', 'comfortable', ""'re"", 'unable', 'suspect', 'up', 'good', 'good', 'old', 'Geoffrey', 'can', 'hardly', 'contain', 'contempt', 'when', 'introduced', 'Sally', 'ex', 'friends', 'Lathams', 'luncheon', 'gathering', 'One', 'just', 'what', 'Geoffrey', ""'problem"", 'overall', 'creepy', 'misogynist', 'simply', 'someone', 'who', 'desperate', 'maintain', ""'lap"", 'luxury', 'lifestyle', 'cost', 'One', 'thing', 'sure', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'handle', 'very', 'well', 'when', 'dealing', 'blackmailers', 'How', 'control', 'freak', 'Geoffrey', 'unable', 'keep', 'weak', 'chemist', 'Blagdon', 'check', 'then', 'Mr.', 'Carroll', 'resort', 'murdering', 'when', ""'m"", 'sure', 'whole', 'paper', 'trail', 'linking', 'mad', 'artist', 'purchases', 'poison', 'been', 'pouring', 'dear', 'wife', 'Sally', 'milk', 'Alexis', 'Smith', 'who', 'cold', 'steely', 'Cecily', 'probably', 'best', 'performance', 'film', 'what', 'exactly', 'see', 'mega-', 'creepy', 'Geoffrey', 'go', 'bed', 'course', 'never', 'see', 'implied', 'Sally', 'when', 'definitively', 'Geoffrey', 'do', 'seeing', 'own', ""'Angel"", 'Death', 'portrait', 'why', 'dither', 'so', 'much', 'Geoffrey', 'time', 'get', 'back', 'home', ""'re"", 'asked', 'accept', 'idea', 'Mrs.', 'Carroll', 'so', 'devastated', 'husband', 'betrayal', 'despondent', 'paralyzed', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bring', 'get', 'house', 'right', 'away', 'most', 'film', 'Stanwyck', 'Sally', 'bland', 'goody', 'two-', 'shoes', 'who', 'merely', 'up', 'Bogie', 'proverbial', 'punching', 'back', 'More', 'enigmatic', 'child', 'actress', 'Ann', 'Carter', 'who', 'eerily', 'good', 'precocious', 'daughter', 'Has', 'been', 'corrupted', 'demented', 'father', 'end', 'believe', 'up', 'undamaged', 'what', 'been', 'put', 'creepy', 'father', ""'The"", 'Two', 'Mrs.', 'Carrolls', 'manages', 'remain', 'only', 'mildly', 'interesting', 'ordinary', 'story', 'here', 'chugs', 'along', 'virtually', 'suspense', 'Bogart', 'oh', 'so', 'wrong', 'part', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'dreary', 'rainy', 'Saturday', 'then', 'means', 'take', 'look', 'should', ""n't"", 'even', 'be', 'next', 'hundred', 'list', 'break', 'DVD', 'rack', 'select', 'almost', 'filled', 'DVR']",N/A
