The performances were good, story line was decent, but for some reason I just didn't feel sympathy for the characters.  Also, I had seen the scenario used previous times, bad guys break in and hold family hostage. Something about the movie really just didn't click, and things seemed casual, mildly disturbing, but casual.  I didn't really like the fact how the viewer was spoken to by the bad guy and the little rewind thing with the remote wasn't too attractive, however it was creative.  I understand that the directors intent was to make the viewer feel guilt for wanting to see violence, but I guess other previous movies numbed me.  This is not the worst movie I have ever seen and I would recremend it as a rental, however, this film just wasn't my style.  Also, I would like to note, the death metal music at beginning, middle, and end, was not enjoyable whatsoever. Before anyone bashes this review saying that just because it didn't have explosions or tons of blood he didn't like it, which is untrue.  Some of my favorite films are The Hand that Rocks the Cradle, Shallow Grave, Fargo, and Blood Simple, none of which are fast paced movies or gore fests, but the style is to my preference.",3,This wasn't a Fun Game,1213142400,"06 11, 2008",2008,1236,"['First', 'off', 'film', 'overhyped', 'performances', 'were', 'good', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'decent', 'reason', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'sympathy', 'characters', 'Also', 'had', 'seen', 'scenario', 'used', 'previous', 'times', 'bad', 'guys', 'break', 'hold', 'family', 'hostage', 'Something', 'movie', 'really', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'click', 'things', 'seemed', 'casual', 'mildly', 'disturbing', 'casual', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'like', 'fact', 'how', 'viewer', 'was', 'spoken', 'bad', 'guy', 'little', 'rewind', 'thing', 'remote', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'attractive', 'however', 'was', 'creative', 'understand', 'directors', 'intent', 'was', 'make', 'viewer', 'feel', 'guilt', 'wanting', 'see', 'violence', 'guess', 'other', 'previous', 'movies', 'not', 'worst', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'would', 'recremend', 'rental', 'however', 'film', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'style', 'Also', 'would', 'like', 'note', 'death', 'metal', 'music', 'beginning', 'middle', 'end', 'was', 'not', 'enjoyable', 'whatsoever', 'anyone', 'bashes', 'review', 'saying', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'explosions', 'tons', 'blood', 'did', ""n't"", 'untrue', 'favorite', 'films', 'are', 'Hand', 'Cradle', 'Shallow', 'Grave', 'Fargo', 'Blood', 'Simple', 'none', 'are', 'fast', 'paced', 'movies', 'gore', 'fests', 'style', 'preference']",N/A

A wealthy family living in a posh house next to a lake is assaulted, brutalized and eventually killed by two seemingly polite young men. The movie's theme is not really about violence - there is nothing here that explains violence or tells you why the human race is so prone to violent behavior - this would require an explanation based in great part in evolutionary psychology and a post 1968 cultural Marxist like Haneke wouldn't touch that with a ten foot pole. It's about how Haneke can manipulate the audience and how he can get away in approving the violence of the young men. Of course, if the brutalized family instead of rich was working class or poor, Haneke couldn't conceive of making such a movie: despite his smugness, Haneke can't escape his run of the mill Marxist thinking. That aside, Funny Games is generally well made, and if Haneke meant to shock the audience, he is pretty successful in doing that.",2,Pointless if well made,1228003200,"11 30, 2008",2008,1051,"['well', 'made', 'generally', 'pointless', 'shot-by-shot', 'remake', '1997', 'Austrian', 'movie', 'Funny', 'Games', 'director', 'Michael', 'Haneke', 'A', 'wealthy', 'family', 'living', 'posh', 'house', 'lake', 'assaulted', 'brutalized', 'eventually', 'killed', 'two', 'seemingly', 'polite', 'young', 'men', 'movie', 'theme', 'not', 'really', 'violence', 'nothing', 'here', 'violence', 'tells', 'why', 'human', 'race', 'so', 'prone', 'violent', 'behavior', 'would', 'require', 'explanation', 'based', 'great', 'part', 'evolutionary', 'psychology', 'post', '1968', 'cultural', 'Marxist', 'Haneke', 'would', ""n't"", 'touch', 'ten', 'foot', 'pole', 'how', 'Haneke', 'can', 'manipulate', 'audience', 'how', 'can', 'get', 'away', 'approving', 'violence', 'young', 'men', 'course', 'brutalized', 'family', 'instead', 'rich', 'was', 'working', 'class', 'poor', 'Haneke', 'could', ""n't"", 'conceive', 'making', 'such', 'movie', 'smugness', 'Haneke', 'ca', ""n't"", 'escape', 'run', 'mill', 'Marxist', 'thinking', 'aside', 'Funny', 'Games', 'generally', 'well', 'made', 'Haneke', 'meant', 'shock', 'audience', 'pretty', 'successful', 'doing']",N/A
1158560,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00187FPC2,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 1]","Some remakes are welcomed, even if most are dreadfully unappealing.  Sometimes the right director can take something we know and love and transfer it with the right amount of freshness that we feel compelled to watch it.  I remember recent films like `The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' and `King Kong' being just as good if not better than the originals.  But there are always the films you wish they'd leave alone because they can never be done as well as they were the first time.I hate referencing Van Sant's 1998 debacle `Psycho' when speaking of Haneke's remake of his own 1997 German thriller, but they are alike in on particular instance.Both are unnecessary.Both films are a shot-for-shot, scene-for-scene, word-for-word remake of the original, and thus both films have a feeling of redundancy that doesn't go away.  The difference between the two is that Haneke's second attempt still feels pristine, complete with stellar performances and signature direction.  Van Sant's film was abysmal.  Still, regardless of how good this film is, there is no denying that it has no purpose, other than to reach an American audience who would really serve themselves well to seek out the original (why is it that we as American's have such a fear of subtitles?).The film is really so much more than a film, for it is not meant to be entertaining.  It is a message film, a film that is meant to shock us into our senses.  It is masterfully crafted by Haneke to ask us the all important question of why; why are we so obsessed with that which we are so afraid?  He attacks our society, a society bent on entertaining ones self with gore and death and horror.  Having the attackers ask us outright how we would handle the situation is pure genius.Are we really so diluted that we dare play along?The performances this go around are just as engrossing as those in the original.  Naomi Watts is flawless as the tormented wife and mother Ann.  The disturbing close ups of her frazzled expressions and tear soaked cheeks are heartbreaking and raw.  She steps into Susanne Lothar's shoes effortlessly.  Tim Roth is not as effective as Ulrich Muhe, but he works well enough.  He has a very warm and inviting face, which I hadn't noticed until this film.  I really felt for him throughout, you just don't want bad things to happen to him.  Michael Pitt was the biggest surprise for me, in a good way.  I have never been drawn to him as an actor, but I must admit that the trailer's for the film made me rethink that.  He was the most compelling visual there, his arrogance playing so well into his character and I must say that he is truly the films highlight.  Such a richly cold character, effortlessly charming and charismatic and hateful.  Brady Corbet plays second fiddle well enough, but he can't really hold his own against Pitt.So, if you have not seen the original and dislike subtitles then by all means watch this movie.  It is brutal and frustrating and heartbreaking to say the least, but it carries the weight of an important message well.  It is not mainstream and it will not end as you expect and it will not deliver the type of `good feeling' thrills that many mainstream horror movies deliver, but if you look at it for what it is and commit to understanding it then you will see it for the masterpiece it is.Haneke is a genius.I consider his original the greatest horror film of all time (on most days at least) and highly recommend it.  This one would have been a masterpiece as well had it not been a remake.  The fact that it has no differing factors makes it feel repetitious.  I didn't feel a need to keep watching despite all the pros presented.  It misses out on a five star review from me for that very reason.",4,"It's very, very good; but it is also very, very unnecessary...",1233187200,"01 29, 2009",2009,3720,"['remakes', 'are', 'welcomed', 'even', 'most', 'are', 'dreadfully', 'unappealing', 'Sometimes', 'right', 'director', 'can', 'take', 'something', 'know', 'love', 'transfer', 'right', 'amount', 'freshness', 'feel', 'compelled', 'watch', 'remember', 'recent', 'films', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'King', 'Kong', 'being', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'not', 'better', 'originals', 'are', 'always', 'films', 'wish', ""'d"", 'leave', 'alone', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'done', 'as', 'well', 'were', 'first', 'time.I', 'hate', 'referencing', 'Van', 'Sant', '1998', 'debacle', 'Psycho', 'when', 'speaking', 'Haneke', 'remake', 'own', '1997', 'German', 'thriller', 'are', 'alike', 'particular', 'instance.Both', 'are', 'unnecessary.Both', 'films', 'are', 'shot-for-shot', 'scene-for-scene', 'word-for-word', 'remake', 'original', 'thus', 'films', 'have', 'feeling', 'redundancy', ""n't"", 'go', 'away', 'difference', 'two', 'Haneke', 'second', 'attempt', 'still', 'pristine', 'complete', 'stellar', 'performances', 'signature', 'direction', 'Van', 'Sant', 'film', 'was', 'abysmal', 'Still', 'regardless', 'how', 'good', 'film', 'denying', 'purpose', 'other', 'reach', 'American', 'audience', 'who', 'would', 'really', 'serve', 'well', 'seek', 'out', 'original', 'why', 'American', 'have', 'fear', 'subtitles', '.The', 'film', 'really', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'film', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'entertaining', 'message', 'film', 'film', 'meant', 'shock', 'senses', 'masterfully', 'crafted', 'Haneke', 'ask', 'important', 'question', 'why', 'why', 'are', 'so', 'obsessed', 'are', 'so', 'afraid', 'society', 'society', 'bent', 'entertaining', 'ones', 'gore', 'death', 'horror', 'Having', 'attackers', 'ask', 'outright', 'how', 'would', 'handle', 'situation', 'pure', 'genius.Are', 'really', 'so', 'diluted', 'dare', 'play', 'along', 'performances', 'go', 'around', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'engrossing', 'original', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'flawless', 'tormented', 'wife', 'mother', 'Ann', 'disturbing', 'close', 'ups', 'frazzled', 'expressions', 'tear', 'soaked', 'cheeks', 'are', 'heartbreaking', 'raw', 'Susanne', 'Lothar', 'shoes', 'effortlessly', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'not', 'as', 'effective', 'Ulrich', 'Muhe', 'well', 'enough', 'very', 'warm', 'inviting', 'face', 'had', ""n't"", 'noticed', 'film', 'really', 'felt', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'bad', 'things', 'happen', 'Michael', 'Pitt', 'was', 'biggest', 'surprise', 'good', 'way', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'drawn', 'actor', 'must', 'admit', 'trailer', 'film', 'made', 'rethink', 'was', 'most', 'compelling', 'visual', 'there', 'arrogance', 'playing', 'so', 'well', 'character', 'must', 'say', 'truly', 'films', 'highlight', 'richly', 'cold', 'character', 'effortlessly', 'charming', 'charismatic', 'hateful', 'Brady', 'Corbet', 'second', 'fiddle', 'well', 'enough', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'hold', 'own', 'Pitt.So', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'original', 'dislike', 'subtitles', 'then', 'means', 'watch', 'movie', 'brutal', 'frustrating', 'heartbreaking', 'say', 'least', 'weight', 'important', 'message', 'well', 'not', 'mainstream', 'will', 'not', 'end', 'expect', 'will', 'not', 'deliver', 'type', 'good', 'feeling', 'thrills', 'many', 'mainstream', 'horror', 'movies', 'deliver', 'look', 'what', 'commit', 'understanding', 'then', 'will', 'see', 'masterpiece', 'genius.I', 'consider', 'original', 'greatest', 'horror', 'film', 'time', 'most', 'days', 'least', 'highly', 'recommend', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'masterpiece', 'as', 'well', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'remake', 'fact', 'differing', 'factors', 'feel', 'repetitious', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'need', 'keep', 'watching', 'pros', 'presented', 'out', 'five', 'star', 'review', 'very', 'reason']",N/A

This isn't a film, it isn't even any kind of credible story.  It is a psuedo intellectual exercise that becomes increasingly annoying as it progresses.

I likewise will not give my characters any sensible reactions to what is happening while I make my villains both omnipotent and totally unreal.

1158563,AMICVV9N2U2R4,B00187FPC2,Atli Hafsteinsson,"[11, 15]","Funny Games introduced me to a new sensation. As I sat in my seat, I felt sick. Viscerally sick. This film is cold and utterly heartless. That's the intent of the film, and it does that well. It chews up the audience and spits them out, painfully. I had no idea what the film actually entailed, and when I found out, I felt violated as few movies have made me feel. I kept watching, practically pleading for the atrocities to end. They didn't.Funny Games harasses the viewer as much as the family it tortures. There is not a moment of resolve or justice in the entire picture, even if doing so has to be achieved by breaking the fourth wall. No breath of fresh air comes the viewer's way. Believe the reviewers, they're not exaggerating. Nobody with a heart can sit through this and not feel horrible.Tim Roth, Devon Gearheart and in particular Naomi Watts all deliver knock-out performances as the doomed family, who one day are accosted by two sterile-looking, psychotic young men who enter their summer house asking for eggs and then refuse to leave, in the most psychologically agonising way possible. They then make a bet with the family that come next morning, they'll all be dead, voicing it as though they're betting on who can hold their breath the longest. With their surface politeness, the two young men engage the family in the horrible situation in which they find themselves. And horrible things do happen. Most of the horrible things happen off-screen, making them even worse.Let me make one thing plain; this is no Saw. Funny Games holds very little blood or physical violence. What it does deliver in spades, however, is emotional violence; how it feels to be coldly taken hostage in your own house and humorously informed that you and your loved ones are gonna die. The situation is made plain, and it delivers.And that's precisely what I vilify. Funny Games forces the audience to make a choice - don't watch and be a happier man, or give in to curiosity and pay the price. It does bad things to the viewer and toys with our emotions. Whatever we want to happen does not. You can interpret that last sentence whichever you like, it still applies. It almost feels like the director is punishing us for empathizing with the family. Is us wanting the family to rise up and fight back against the two monsters who invade their lives so bad? Why would anyone invest in such an unpleasant film if you get no payoff at all to show for it?Horrible as Funny Games feels to watch, I have to commend the cast for their superb performances. Great as Tim Roth is as the dad, Naomi Watts really steals the show with a performance that is impossible not to be shaken to the core by, a loving mother who suddenly finds herself in hell in her own home with little she can do against her torturers. Her son's sheer terror is something I have not been able to get out of my mind or heart, either; Devon Gearheart is a terrific rising talent. Michael Pitt and Brady Corbet do their job good as well; I struggle to think of characters I hate more, pure sadists with no motives given for their actions apart from the apparent enjoyment they find in it, deaf to the pleads of both the family and the audience, breaking all rules of storytelling by conversing with the audience and just doing everything to make sure that nothing good can happen.The acting by the family gets 5 stars; they make you feel for them and root for them, making the ride even more painful. The movie itself gets 1. It's well-made, but that's not my point. Funny Games is disgusting. Not because of the amount of physical violence (there is little on-screen), but because of the emotions it forces you to feel. It seeps into your skin and denies you any sort of resolve. You're a happier person without the images of this movie stuck in your head. They may not be graphic in the conventional sense, but they sure are horrible.",2,Disgusting,1286582400,"10 9, 2010",2010,3898,"['Funny', 'Games', 'introduced', 'new', 'sensation', 'sat', 'seat', 'felt', 'sick', 'Viscerally', 'sick', 'film', 'cold', 'utterly', 'heartless', 'intent', 'film', 'well', 'up', 'audience', 'out', 'painfully', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'film', 'actually', 'entailed', 'when', 'found', 'felt', 'violated', 'few', 'movies', 'have', 'made', 'feel', 'kept', 'watching', 'practically', 'pleading', 'atrocities', 'end', ""didn't.Funny"", 'Games', 'viewer', 'as', 'much', 'family', 'not', 'moment', 'resolve', 'justice', 'entire', 'picture', 'even', 'doing', 'so', 'be', 'achieved', 'breaking', 'fourth', 'wall', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'viewer', 'way', 'Believe', 'reviewers', ""'re"", 'not', 'exaggerating', 'Nobody', 'heart', 'can', 'sit', 'not', 'feel', 'horrible.Tim', 'Roth', 'Devon', 'Gearheart', 'particular', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'deliver', 'knock-out', 'performances', 'doomed', 'family', 'who', 'one', 'day', 'are', 'accosted', 'two', 'sterile-looking', 'psychotic', 'young', 'men', 'who', 'enter', 'summer', 'house', 'asking', 'eggs', 'then', 'refuse', 'leave', 'most', 'psychologically', 'agonising', 'way', 'possible', 'then', 'make', 'bet', 'family', 'come', 'next', 'morning', ""'ll"", 'be', 'dead', 'voicing', ""'re"", 'betting', 'who', 'can', 'hold', 'breath', 'longest', 'surface', 'politeness', 'two', 'young', 'men', 'engage', 'family', 'horrible', 'situation', 'find', 'horrible', 'things', 'do', 'happen', 'Most', 'horrible', 'things', 'happen', 'off-screen', 'making', 'even', 'worse.Let', 'make', 'one', 'thing', 'plain', 'Saw', 'Funny', 'Games', 'very', 'little', 'blood', 'physical', 'violence', 'What', 'deliver', 'spades', 'however', 'emotional', 'violence', 'how', 'be', 'coldly', 'taken', 'hostage', 'own', 'house', 'humorously', 'informed', 'loved', 'ones', 'are', 'gon', 'die', 'situation', 'made', 'plain', 'precisely', 'what', 'vilify', 'Funny', 'Games', 'audience', 'make', 'choice', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'be', 'happier', 'man', 'give', 'curiosity', 'pay', 'price', 'bad', 'things', 'viewer', 'emotions', 'want', 'happen', 'not', 'can', 'interpret', 'last', 'sentence', 'still', 'almost', 'feels', 'director', 'punishing', 'empathizing', 'family', 'wanting', 'family', 'rise', 'up', 'fight', 'back', 'two', 'monsters', 'who', 'invade', 'lives', 'so', 'bad', 'Why', 'would', 'anyone', 'invest', 'such', 'unpleasant', 'film', 'get', 'payoff', 'show', 'Horrible', 'Funny', 'Games', 'feels', 'watch', 'have', 'commend', 'cast', 'superb', 'performances', 'Great', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'dad', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'really', 'show', 'performance', 'impossible', 'not', 'be', 'shaken', 'core', 'loving', 'mother', 'who', 'suddenly', 'hell', 'own', 'home', 'little', 'can', 'do', 'torturers', 'son', 'sheer', 'terror', 'something', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'able', 'get', 'mind', 'heart', 'either', 'Devon', 'Gearheart', 'terrific', 'rising', 'talent', 'Michael', 'Pitt', 'Brady', 'Corbet', 'do', 'job', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'struggle', 'think', 'characters', 'hate', 'more', 'pure', 'sadists', 'motives', 'given', 'actions', 'apart', 'apparent', 'enjoyment', 'find', 'pleads', 'family', 'audience', 'breaking', 'rules', 'storytelling', 'conversing', 'audience', 'just', 'doing', 'everything', 'make', 'sure', 'nothing', 'good', 'can', 'happen.The', 'acting', 'family', '5', 'stars', 'make', 'feel', 'root', 'making', 'ride', 'even', 'more', 'painful', 'movie', '1', 'well-made', 'not', 'point', 'Funny', 'Games', 'disgusting', 'Not', 'amount', 'physical', 'violence', 'little', 'on-screen', 'emotions', 'feel', 'skin', 'denies', 'sort', 'resolve', ""'re"", 'happier', 'person', 'images', 'movie', 'stuck', 'head', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'graphic', 'conventional', 'sense', 'sure', 'are', 'horrible']",N/A

1158565,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00187FPC2,B. E Jackson,"[4, 7]","Tonight I watched Funny Games for the first time.  I read the description on my satellite TV, thought it sounded good, so I went in watching a movie thinking I would KNOW how the story would unfold around every turn.  I was wrong.  WAY wrong.Let me say something first- there are SPOILERS in my review.  Please don't read my review if you don't want to know what happens.I am in complete shock right now.  I've never seen a movie like this before.  The storyline takes torturing an innocent family to a whole new level of shock and fear.  In fact, this movie shows you just how sick and twisted human beings can be if they wanted.  Just as sick, if not MORE sick, than wild animals.A young man arrives to the front door of a rich family house and asks the wife of the house for some eggs.  After she finally gives him the eggs, the young man supposedly drops them by accident and ask for more eggs as he's walking out the front door.  The wife is a bit ticked off about this, but decides to give in and give the man more eggs and tells him to be a bit more careful next time.THIS is where things get really good as the friend of the young man appears, and it turns out the two guys have no intention of leaving the house.  You just knew they weren't going to leave, but despite knowing that full well, the storyline was NOT predictable in any way starting from this point on.Let's just say, this movie will make you think.  While watching it you'll be frightened at the possibility of a similar situation happening to you.  Oh sure, you probably think it's not possible, but watch carefully the way the story unfolds and the way the two bad guys enter the picture and rather politely ask for things and how the family gives in because they took notice of the polite nature of the two evil gentlemen.It's really really sick.  I mean REALLY sick.  You'll have to watch the movie to really see what I mean.  The two evil young men were so polite and cared about appropriate manners so much, that they didn't appear very evil in the beginning.And the way some of the torture and death scenes happen is almost insanely crazy in the head.  One scene that TRULY struck me on a personal level is the one that involved the one bad guy going into the kitchen to make himself a sandwich, and while he's very calmly and normally making himself a sandwich, a shotgun goes off in the other room, you hear the wife scream in fear, and then you see blood on the TV screen while the little boy of the family was just murdered in a very disturbing way.  I did NOT see that coming.  It's almost against the rules to have such a graphic scene in a movie involving children.  Sorry, it just SHOULD be.For the next several minutes, for what seems like forever, the wife and husband try to cope with what the two evil men just DID to their son.  They cried, they were shocked, they didn't know what to think or even do except try to free themselves.  The scene moved along at a pace that felt a little TOO realistic for my tastes, because it looked EXACTLY like how a wife and husband would react when they found out their child had just died.  I was completely shocked.  No other way to put it.Another reason that scene was disturbing on a personal level is because, with the TV on and the evil men watching a Nascar race, the setting almost gives off a happy or comfortable one, almost like a family time gathering in front of the TV, but it's definitely NOT a happy one that's for sure.  In fact it's *so* bad you just wanna grab the shotgun that was used to kill the boy and turn the gun on yourself to get away from such a sickening situation.You can't help but think about yourself in these situations because it's *so* realistic.Furthermore, some more deaths happen later in the movie, and it's absolutely amazing HOW the wife dies.  I won't say how it happens but it happens during a moment you will NOT predict, which shows no compassion for human life whatsoever.  The two men didn't even care they were killing in such disturbingly graphic ways because they were either masters at it or didn't know the difference between reality and fantasy.  It shows you just how easy it can be to kill.I HATE this movie and yet the shockingly quiet and realistic feel of the entire story forces me to give it 5 stars because I've never experienced anything like this before.  I can go on and on about other disturbing scenes but I won't.  Only recommended if you have a STRONG stomach and an ability not to be affected when thinking about death and killing.",5,no words can describe this,1232841600,"01 25, 2009",2009,4532,"['Tonight', 'watched', 'Funny', 'Games', 'first', 'time', 'read', 'description', 'satellite', 'TV', 'thought', 'sounded', 'good', 'went', 'watching', 'movie', 'thinking', 'would', 'KNOW', 'how', 'story', 'would', 'unfold', 'turn', 'was', 'wrong', 'WAY', 'say', 'something', 'first-', 'are', 'SPOILERS', 'review', 'Please', 'do', ""n't"", 'read', 'review', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'know', 'what', 'am', 'complete', 'shock', 'right', 'now', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'movie', 'before', 'storyline', 'torturing', 'innocent', 'family', 'whole', 'new', 'level', 'shock', 'fear', 'fact', 'movie', 'just', 'how', 'sick', 'twisted', 'human', 'beings', 'can', 'be', 'wanted', 'Just', 'sick', 'not', 'MORE', 'sick', 'wild', 'animals.A', 'young', 'man', 'front', 'door', 'rich', 'family', 'house', 'wife', 'house', 'eggs', 'finally', 'eggs', 'young', 'man', 'supposedly', 'accident', 'ask', 'more', 'eggs', 'walking', 'out', 'front', 'door', 'wife', 'bit', 'ticked', 'off', 'give', 'give', 'man', 'more', 'eggs', 'be', 'bit', 'more', 'careful', 'next', 'time.THIS', 'where', 'things', 'get', 'really', 'good', 'friend', 'young', 'man', 'out', 'two', 'guys', 'have', 'intention', 'leaving', 'house', 'just', 'knew', 'were', ""n't"", 'going', 'leave', 'knowing', 'full', 'well', 'storyline', 'was', 'NOT', 'predictable', 'way', 'starting', 'point', 'on.Let', 'just', 'say', 'movie', 'will', 'make', 'think', 'watching', ""'ll"", 'be', 'frightened', 'possibility', 'similar', 'situation', 'happening', 'Oh', 'sure', 'probably', 'think', 'not', 'possible', 'watch', 'carefully', 'way', 'story', 'unfolds', 'way', 'two', 'bad', 'guys', 'enter', 'picture', 'rather', 'politely', 'ask', 'things', 'how', 'family', 'took', 'notice', 'polite', 'nature', 'two', 'evil', 'gentlemen.It', 'really', 'really', 'sick', 'mean', 'REALLY', 'sick', ""'ll"", 'have', 'watch', 'movie', 'really', 'see', 'what', 'mean', 'two', 'evil', 'young', 'men', 'were', 'so', 'polite', 'cared', 'appropriate', 'manners', 'so', 'much', 'did', ""n't"", 'appear', 'very', 'evil', 'beginning.And', 'way', 'torture', 'death', 'scenes', 'happen', 'almost', 'insanely', 'crazy', 'head', 'One', 'scene', 'TRULY', 'struck', 'personal', 'level', 'one', 'involved', 'one', 'bad', 'guy', 'going', 'kitchen', 'make', 'sandwich', 'very', 'calmly', 'normally', 'making', 'sandwich', 'shotgun', 'off', 'other', 'room', 'hear', 'wife', 'scream', 'fear', 'then', 'see', 'blood', 'TV', 'screen', 'little', 'boy', 'family', 'was', 'just', 'murdered', 'very', 'disturbing', 'way', 'did', 'NOT', 'see', 'coming', 'almost', 'rules', 'have', 'graphic', 'scene', 'movie', 'involving', 'children', 'Sorry', 'just', 'SHOULD', 'be.For', 'next', 'several', 'minutes', 'what', 'forever', 'wife', 'husband', 'try', 'cope', 'what', 'two', 'evil', 'men', 'just', 'DID', 'son', 'cried', 'were', 'shocked', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'think', 'even', 'do', 'try', 'free', 'scene', 'moved', 'along', 'pace', 'felt', 'little', 'TOO', 'realistic', 'tastes', 'looked', 'EXACTLY', 'how', 'wife', 'husband', 'would', 'react', 'when', 'found', 'out', 'child', 'had', 'just', 'died', 'was', 'completely', 'shocked', 'other', 'way', 'put', 'it.Another', 'reason', 'scene', 'was', 'disturbing', 'personal', 'level', 'TV', 'evil', 'men', 'watching', 'Nascar', 'race', 'setting', 'almost', 'off', 'happy', 'comfortable', 'one', 'almost', 'family', 'time', 'gathering', 'front', 'TV', 'definitely', 'NOT', 'happy', 'one', 'sure', 'fact', '*so*', 'bad', 'just', 'wan', 'grab', 'shotgun', 'was', 'used', 'kill', 'boy', 'turn', 'gun', 'get', 'away', 'such', 'sickening', 'situation.You', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'situations', '*so*', 'realistic.Furthermore', 'more', 'deaths', 'happen', 'later', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'HOW', 'wife', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'how', 'moment', 'will', 'NOT', 'predict', 'compassion', 'human', 'life', 'whatsoever', 'two', 'men', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'care', 'were', 'killing', 'such', 'disturbingly', 'graphic', 'ways', 'were', 'masters', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'difference', 'reality', 'fantasy', 'just', 'how', 'easy', 'can', 'be', 'kill.I', 'HATE', 'movie', 'yet', 'shockingly', 'quiet', 'realistic', 'feel', 'entire', 'story', 'forces', 'give', '5', 'stars', ""'ve"", 'never', 'experienced', 'anything', 'can', 'go', 'other', 'disturbing', 'scenes', 'wo', ""n't"", 'Only', 'recommended', 'have', 'STRONG', 'stomach', 'ability', 'not', 'be', 'affected', 'when', 'thinking', 'death', 'killing']",N/A

As a matter of fact, if you find yourself enjoying FUNNY GAMES, you might want to seek some psychological assistance immediately! No, FUNNY GAMES is not entertainment, it is an indictment. This is our own bloodlust both denied and parodied in the most vicious and purposely frustrating manner. No one is meant to be satisfied. Average viewers will be sickened by the sheer nihilism and shocking doom involved. Goreh&uuml;nts will be frustrated by the lack of gory violence (99% is off-camera). Nudity-seekers will only get the agony on the face of the disrobing victim. Action lovers will groan at the lack of any hero or thrills. Yet, the point is well taken that we watch murders (in movies) every day with glee. It's only when these murders are not glorified or sanitized that we seem to flinch. FUNNY GAMES gives us what we think we want, then makes us watch something we'd rather not see. This movie breaks many rules, both social and cinematic. It is best viewed without warning for maximum, intended effect. Did I ""like"" FUNNY GAMES? No. It gets five stars from me because it accomplished it's goal. It made me think, perhaps re-evaluate. I love all things horror, but this is definitely one for the ages! Who should NOT see this movie? 1- The very old, unless they're ancient, sociopathic sadists. 2- The very young, unless years of nightmares and therapy aren't a problem. 3- Anyone expecting just another hollywood ""drama"".

1158573,A3W4CFBZUZ5SX3,B00187FPC2,buck nelson,"[0, 3]","Michael Pitt shines as psycho-path Paul in a film that could be taken a few ways.  I happened to take it as cautionary entertainment, nihilistic entertainment.  The Boys, Paul and Peter, go about their torcher routine for the sake of something to do.  Why not?  It's something to do.I believe a ""take home"" message could be that in this crazy world we live, where we are so desensitized, so disconnected from others, from Nature, such a scenario could exist.  Why not?  (Not that I believe this is what the film is advocating some do for fun, nor what I am advocating, either--It's a movie!!)  It drives home the absurdness of how we generally lead our lives, and how a few (albeit, highly unbalanced) people could adopt such an extreme ""hobby"" in reaction to the insanity.If one looks at it so, one sees the illusion in which we live.  Take Watts' character.  Look at her in that kitchen.  So perfect.  She could be June Cleaver or Carol Brady, or (insert your choice).  Her character is playing a role, an image.  When Peter shows up on her doorstep, she puts on the act.  She says pleasantries, she's positive, she's...well, what many of us have become: a clone of clones.  Disconnected from reality, she exists in her own little perfect, privileged life, surrounded by others of such a paradigm.  She does not see herself clearly, honestly, and so does not see others clearly, honestly.  This, I believe, is evidenced in the way she interacts with Peter, in the kitchen.Wanting desperately to just live our lives, we become oblivious to who lives next door, or down the street, or in the next town, or in another country.  We do not want to be bothered with that.  We want to be left alone with our fun and games and big screen TVs, and lakeshore getaway homes.  But others who have had a different experience, who have different ""fun"" and ""games,"" creep into our pretty paintings and want to splash red paint all over.  Why?  For a myriad of reasons, and Paul enumerates several, though they are not necessarily truthful.Looking at the film deeper, Paul and Peter are not real people (obviously), they're allegorical.  They symbolize the evil, the darkness, the hate that everywhere exists, yet is repressed, ignored, denied.  Paul and Peter represent what happens when we fail to reach out to others, when we fail to be compassionate, when we fail to look within ourselves.  Paul and Peter symbolize what happens when evil, darkness, hate are not acknowledged, confronted: they kill us! They kill us in all manner of different ways, mercilessly.So what is the purpose for this film?  The individual must come to his own personal revelation, if s/he comes to one at all.  This is what came forth for me.  But I do not claim that it is what is being put forth, it's just what came forth for me.  Certainly Haneke had other intentions.  Such have been readily stated in myriad reviews.By the way, it is in no way the most violent film, per se.  The violence occurs mostly in your imagination, not on the screen.  Good luck!

1158574,A2FPDWTD9AENVK,B00187FPC2,Carl Manes,"[3, 3]","Michael Haneke's Americanized version of his own internationally acclaimed film is quite literally a shot-for-shot remake, with every single character movement and reaction decided well in advance. While this calls into question the validity of remaking the sensational and shocking first film, the original FUNNY GAMES would stand very little chance for success in an American wide release in its original language and without big named actors attached, so it is not as unexpected a remake as it is redundant.The main reason audiences around the world were willing to accept the often unnatural dialog and off characters in the German language film is due much in part to the fact that the it was foreign, which allowed audiences to suspend disbelief by assuming that the formal sentence structure could be attributed to language differences between cultures. In the English version, though the words themselves have been fully translated, the language and formal sentence structure do not carry over in to standard every day vernacular, making the dialog between the characters even more awkward and unnatural. This generates a rift that distances the audience from the events on screen, since they do not reflect our reality. Haneke chooses not to include a score, forcing the audience to confront the carefully constructed character exchanges and focus intently on them.Like in the recasting of Damien in the THE OMEN remake, Michael Pitt and Brady Corbet are too expectantly evil in the roles of Peter and Paul. Their arrival leaves no question as to their intent from the very beginning, so the jarring change in gears exhibited in the original film is completely lost here. The rigid, robotic acting of the entire cast can more likely be attributed to Haneke's direction and clear stylization than to the actors' performances.The striking commentary that was imbued in the earlier version remains intact in the US film, and it is just as hypocritical that the remake continues to use sensationalistic violence as a tool to make a social critique against violence in the media. In breaking the 4th wall and having the villains address and directly interact with the audience, Haneke constantly poses the question ""If you are so shocked and disgusted, why do you continue to watch?"" in a series of direct attacks against violence as a form of entertainment. His weapons take on the pseudonyms ""Tom and Jerry"" as well as ""Beavis and Butt-head"" at different points throughout the script in reference to the more extreme cartoon characters that have directly and indirectly influenced societies and cultures around the world through their violent actions that constantly pass without consequence.The purpose of the FUNNY GAMES remake was not so much to improve and better the film in any way, but rather to expose a far greater population to the plot and themes acted out in the original. By choreographing every detail in the exact same way as before, Haneke proves that the actors in his films are inconsequential to his script and style, however this second attempt at generating steam for the film in America still fell drastically short of its intended success. FUNNY GAMES remains to be more suitable as an Art House picture as opposed to an outright Horror film, but its terrifying themes and biting social commentaries still shine through in the US version.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",4,Funny Games,1271462400,"04 17, 2010",2010,3398,"['Michael', 'Haneke', 'Americanized', 'version', 'own', 'internationally', 'acclaimed', 'film', 'quite', 'literally', 'shot-for-shot', 'remake', 'single', 'character', 'movement', 'reaction', 'decided', 'well', 'advance', 'question', 'validity', 'remaking', 'sensational', 'shocking', 'first', 'film', 'original', 'FUNNY', 'GAMES', 'would', 'stand', 'very', 'little', 'chance', 'success', 'American', 'wide', 'release', 'original', 'language', 'big', 'named', 'actors', 'attached', 'not', 'as', 'unexpected', 'remake', 'redundant.The', 'main', 'reason', 'audiences', 'world', 'were', 'willing', 'accept', 'often', 'unnatural', 'dialog', 'off', 'characters', 'German', 'language', 'film', 'due', 'much', 'part', 'fact', 'was', 'foreign', 'allowed', 'audiences', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'assuming', 'formal', 'sentence', 'structure', 'could', 'be', 'attributed', 'language', 'differences', 'cultures', 'English', 'version', 'words', 'have', 'been', 'fully', 'translated', 'language', 'formal', 'sentence', 'structure', 'do', 'not', 'carry', 'over', 'standard', 'day', 'vernacular', 'making', 'dialog', 'characters', 'even', 'more', 'awkward', 'unnatural', 'rift', 'audience', 'events', 'screen', 'do', 'not', 'reflect', 'reality', 'Haneke', 'not', 'include', 'score', 'forcing', 'audience', 'confront', 'carefully', 'constructed', 'character', 'exchanges', 'focus', 'intently', 'them.Like', 'recasting', 'Damien', 'THE', 'OMEN', 'remake', 'Michael', 'Pitt', 'Brady', 'Corbet', 'are', 'too', 'expectantly', 'roles', 'Peter', 'Paul', 'arrival', 'question', 'intent', 'very', 'beginning', 'jarring', 'change', 'gears', 'exhibited', 'original', 'film', 'completely', 'lost', 'here', 'rigid', 'robotic', 'acting', 'entire', 'cast', 'can', 'more', 'likely', 'be', 'attributed', 'Haneke', 'direction', 'clear', 'stylization', 'actors', 'performances.The', 'striking', 'commentary', 'was', 'imbued', 'earlier', 'version', 'intact', 'US', 'film', 'just', 'as', 'hypocritical', 'remake', 'use', 'sensationalistic', 'violence', 'tool', 'make', 'social', 'critique', 'violence', 'media', 'breaking', '4th', 'wall', 'having', 'villains', 'address', 'directly', 'interact', 'audience', 'Haneke', 'constantly', 'question', 'are', 'so', 'shocked', 'disgusted', 'why', 'do', 'continue', 'watch', 'series', 'direct', 'attacks', 'violence', 'form', 'entertainment', 'weapons', 'take', 'pseudonyms', 'Tom', 'Jerry', 'as', 'well', 'Beavis', 'Butt-head', 'different', 'points', 'script', 'reference', 'more', 'extreme', 'cartoon', 'characters', 'have', 'directly', 'indirectly', 'influenced', 'societies', 'cultures', 'world', 'violent', 'actions', 'constantly', 'pass', 'consequence.The', 'purpose', 'FUNNY', 'GAMES', 'remake', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'improve', 'better', 'film', 'way', 'rather', 'expose', 'far', 'greater', 'population', 'plot', 'themes', 'acted', 'out', 'original', 'choreographing', 'detail', 'exact', 'same', 'way', 'before', 'Haneke', 'actors', 'films', 'are', 'inconsequential', 'script', 'style', 'however', 'second', 'attempt', 'generating', 'steam', 'film', 'America', 'still', 'fell', 'drastically', 'short', 'intended', 'success', 'FUNNY', 'GAMES', 'be', 'more', 'suitable', 'Art', 'House', 'picture', 'opposed', 'outright', 'Horror', 'film', 'terrifying', 'themes', 'biting', 'social', 'commentaries', 'still', 'shine', 'US', 'version.-Carl', 'ManesI', 'Horror', 'Movies']",N/A

And how on earth are we supposed to accept that she would not tell her friends (on the boat, early in the film) that they were clearly in some kind of danger??  She even lied to them to say her husband had injured himself, though she knew he was hit by one of the losers with a golf club.  That was the one fatal flaw in the film that I could not accept.  Without that, then maybe I would have given the film one more star.  The two leads were largely wasted here (especially Tim Roth--they could have hired any guy to play his role).  I am only giving it two stars because I couldn't deny that it lured me in early on.  But after awhile, those LONG lingering camera shots got very tedious.  I was able to do other things while watching this movie without missing anything.  Maybe if I were younger and more naive, I might have been affected in some way.  I was just waiting for the credits to roll (or flash, as it turns out; figures they'd do something so cool like that).  Another two hours wasted on a useless film.I'll add that I saw this about a month after I completely wasted an hour-and-a-half on ""The Strangers"".

1158578,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B00187FPC2,Chris Pandolfi,"[8, 11]","The strange thing about a movie like ""Funny Games"" is that you have absolutely no idea how to feel about it; you're drawn into the originality of the film's structure, but at the same time, you're repulsed by undeserved acts of cruelty against innocent people. That's the point of ""Funny Games,"" I guess, although I can't help but question some of the choices made by writer/director Michael Haneke. This is, frankly, a very ugly film that gets even uglier with every passing scene, and at a certain point, you begin to feel overburdened. Was it necessary for him to drive his point so far? Was there really no other way for him to say what he wanted to say? I really don't know; the social commentary is well beyond the biting variety, so it's possible I missed something along the way. All I can say is that Haneke's ""Funny Games""--based on his own Austrian film from 1997--is sadistic and terrifying in a soft-spoken way that really gets under your skin.The plot: when George (Tim Roth) and his wife, Ann (Naomi Watts), and son, Georgie (Devon Gearhart) drive to their upscale lake house on vacation, they're introduced to two young men: Paul (Michael Pitt) and Peter (Brady Corbet), both of whom look exactly like spoiled yuppie kids. Things are tense right from the start, and it's only partly because the family dog is incessantly barking. First, Peter timidly asks Ann if he could borrow four eggs, and after they all ""accidentally"" break, he timidly asks for four more, at which point he ""accidentally"" pushes Ann's cell phone into the water-filled kitchen sink. Then Paul enters and imposes himself even further than Peter, asking if he could take a look at one of George's golf clubs. By the time George comes back to the house, Ann is just plain frustrated with Paul and Peter and demands that they leave. Paul then breaks George's leg with the golf club and takes the entire family hostage.Thus begins a series of mind games, and no, I'm not going to describe them one by one. There's really no need to, since the point of this movie is not what's happening or why; the point is simply that it's happening. Paul and Peter, cordial as always, raise the stakes even higher by betting that all three family members will be dead by 9:00 the following morning. ""What do you think?"" says Paul to the audience, breaking the fourth wall. ""I'm sure you're on their side."" The thing is, it eventually becomes painfully clear that what side we're on doesn't matter; Paul's occasional remarks to the audience show that this character is in control, despite the expected conventions of psychological thrillers. To a degree, this is actually pretty clever. Let's face it: a fictional character doesn't address an audience that often. The first time happens early on, when Paul forces Ann to find something via a game of Hide and Seek--he turns to the camera and smirks in a quiet moment of superiority.Immediately after that, we see Peter essentially turning a golf club into a phallic symbol. One can argue that he has no such power, since Paul constantly berates Peter for his weight and supposed lack of intelligence. Besides, Peter never once engages the audience directly. Then again, who's to say both young men aren't doing this just to mess with our minds? Or with the family's collective mind? In all likelihood, they're trying to mess with everyone's mind, character and spectator alike. The blurred line between fact and fiction is discussed at the end of the film, and while their conversation made absolutely no sense, it was still intriguing. The words of sociopaths are always just as intriguing as they are disturbing, simply because they have no sense of right or wrong and therefore feel no remorse.I'm sort of dancing around the issue here, which basically boils down to how I really feel about this film. I wish I knew; I give it credit for being one of the scariest movies I've ever seen, and I don't mean that it has startling moments that make you jump. If anything, this movie moves at a snail's pace, which in this case is appropriate because it builds tension, enough for ten regular horror movies. Several shots are distant and uninterrupted for minutes on ends, with no music and virtually no dialogue. These are the kinds of shots that make you dread what will happen next, especially when cinematic clues aren't left behind.At the same time, I find many of the film's satirical ideas too unpleasant and nonsensical. I can't explain this without being maddeningly vague: let's just say that, at a certain point, Paul literally reverses a section of the film so that, when replayed, it will end the way he wants it to. This is nothing more than a copout on Haneke's part because it ruins all of the tension the film had built up. Paul eventually comments that Ann won't play anymore because she's had enough: ""Have you had enough?"" he asks the audience. ""Don't you want a full-length movie with plausible plot developments?"" Sure we do. But what's plausible about a character that can manipulate the structure of a story, thereby altering the ending? Never mind; the sheer cruelty of ""Funny Games"" will turn audiences off even faster than the structure. I avoided describing what Paul and Peter do to their hostages, but make no mistake--they do some really bad things, and they do them slowly, methodically, even politely. As I entered the theater, I noticed the film's tagline on the poster: ""You must admit, you brought this on yourself."" It wasn't until I left that I finally understood the point of that statement.",3,Time to Play,1206921600,"03 31, 2008",2008,5545,"['strange', 'thing', 'movie', 'Funny', 'Games', 'have', 'absolutely',

1158579,AS558SNWF1DXG,B00187FPC2,Clare Quilty,"[4, 5]","Hey, I like thrillers and Polanski-esque tension and films that zig when they should zag as much as anybody.I like 'em probably more than most.But I don't think movies should serve the function ""Funny Games"" attempts to perform.The film, essentially, wants to punish its viewers for first watching a thriller and then for caring about the characters. It's like a toaster that aspires to shave your whiskers with its high heat -- you want to tell it, ""Settle down and just make the toast, bud.""There's been a lot of talk about how this is anti-American or anti-bourgeois or anti-wealth.I don't care about that perspective, whatever. All I know is Naomi Watts and Tim Roth and Devon Gearhart play a well-to-do family who go to their vacation home one sunny day and encounter two cherub-faced prep crackpots who let themselves in and politely-but-firmly mess with the family's minds, bodies and lives for an hour-and-a-half straight.The movie is apparently a reaction to ultra-violent movies. It doesn't follow arcs or acts or even include much in the way of twists. It's just one ascending scale as the family's plight gets worse and worse and worse. Every time you think the family is going to get away or get to fight back, the boys get the upper hand. And their upper hand is clammy, man, clammy.The notion Haneke seems to be putting across is, ""You think you like messed up situations? Here is a really messed up situation. It's going to make you want revenge. But there is no revenge."" Presumably because in life, with the worst instances of human behavior, there's rarely satisfactory vengeance.This overlooks two important things:1. Messed-up people who can't disassociate movie violence from real violence will not get the director's point. They will just get off. Because while Haneke is surprisingly able to keep the violent activity off-screen, this is a movie with a ton of bad ideas buzzing around.2. Haneke is not just defying the expectations of thriller fans, he's going against the basic rules of drama and narrative. If a story -- violent or otherwise -- has no arc, no resolution, no satisfaction, no closure, no hope ... what's the point of telling it? Much less telling it twice, since this is a remake of Haneke's 1997 Austrian film of the same name.And this is unfortunate, too, because director Haneke is the real deal. He's got the gift of a true and unique craftsman. He's especially good at using long, largely static takes and at using camera distance to heighten tension. A seemingly innocent early long shot of four well-dressed people standing in an expansive yard bathed in amber sunlight literally made my skin crawl with dread.Added to which: Anybody who likes powerfully creepy movies should have already seen Haneke's ""Cache,"" which handles similar subjects but with a far subtler and more effective approach.A final note: Although I disagree with the approach Haneke takes, I can't fault his camera skill any more than I can the performances. Foremost is Watts who is so good, so game, she almost makes the ugliness worthwhile.",2,What happens when a director is torn between sadism and self-righteousness?

I kept thinking that these are people who don't watch Law and Order.  The Law and Order franchise is based on hating preppie killers getting away with murder.  The success of social leverage is so improbable in a non exclusive (literally gated and then gated again) community.  I kept thinking a Black patriarch would have just slapped them both to the ground and an Asian family just wouldn't answer the doorbell.  It was so interesting that the ""friendships"" and the chumminess is so shallow that the family didn't even question why their neighbors were so standoffish.  That should have sent off alarm bells.  Everyone's so concerned about their standing relative to their also successful and also white neighbors that they just think maybe someone in a lame 80's preppie uniform must be on the inside whereas they the cold shouldered are on the outside.  Is this the case in GERMANY?  Also peculiar was how none of the victims ever shouted to the next targets to warn them even if there were hostages.  SFW.

There is no swelling music: Just the sound of a television (NASCAR) and the groans and eventual screams...and all we see is a guy fixing himself a sandwich.It's moments like this--and the long, one-take shot afterwards--that show the movie that ""Funny Games"" could have been.  As is, the movie largely falls flat, mainly because we've seen this before.  Two young home invaders (Michael Pitt and Brady Corbet) have decided to torment a well-to do family (Tim Roth, Naomi Watts, and young Devon Gearhart) at their summer home.  Their games are as much psychological as physical, and what they do is truly terrifying...but we are a culture that has seen ""Saw"" and its immitators take torture to a whole new (if not always high quality) level.""Funny Games"" excels on the psychological note, but is almost too dependent on the threat of physical harm.  Pitt, Roth, and Watts are spectacular as usual: Pitt has played this role before (""Murder By Numbers,"" where he was partnered with an evil Ryan Gosling) and so has it down pat; Watts is always good as the daring damsel in distress, unafraid to fight back; and Roth is just good in any role (although, arguably, he makes for a poor chimpanzee; but that's another film and another discussion).  The dialogue is conversational and realistic, but certain things just never gel together.  Ultimately, though the threats are realistic enough, it's just never threatening; we feel like we are watching two spoiled rich boys acting out violent fantasies, which is nothing revelatory, and ultimately has nothing new to offer the film-goer (the afore-mentioned ""Murder By Numbers"" suffered a similar fate, though this is by far a superior film).  It certainly tries--especially with some ""cinematic cheats"" near the end, which come out as more frustrating than clever.  This is more than ""torture porn,"" but it's not the great psychological horror film it could have been.  As is, ""Funny Games"" is little more than well-acted, bloody popcorn entertainment...which is certainly better than most horror films out there today.",3,"3.5 Stars--Some genuinely, truly terrifying moments.",1230163200,"12 25, 2008",2008,2252,"['one', 'point', 'Michael', 'Heneke', 'American', 'adaptation', 'Funny', 'Games', 'watch', 'young', 'sadist', 'fixes', 'sandwich', 'equally', 'sadistic', 'pal', 'family', 'off-screen', 'swelling', 'music', 'Just', 'sound', 'television', 'NASCAR', 'groans', 'eventual', 'screams', 'see', 'guy', 'fixing', 'sandwich.It', 'moments', 'long', 'one-take', 'shot', 'afterwards', 'show', 'movie', 'Funny', 'Games', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'movie', 'largely', 'flat', 'mainly', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'before', 'Two', 'young', 'home', 'invaders', 'Michael', 'Pitt', 'Brady', 'Corbet', 'have', 'decided', 'torment', 'well-to', 'do', 'family', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'young', 'Devon', 'Gearhart', 'summer', 'home', 'games', 'are', 'much', 'psychological', 'physical', 'what', 'do', 'truly', 'terrifying', 'are', 'culture', 'seen', 'Saw', 'immitators', 'take', 'torture', 'whole', 'new', 'not', 'always', 'high', 'quality', 'level', 'Funny', 'Games', 'excels', 'psychological', 'note', 'almost', 'too', 'dependent', 'threat', 'physical', 'harm', 'Pitt', 'Roth', 'Watts', 'are', 'spectacular', 'usual', 'Pitt', 'played', 'role', 'Murder', 'Numbers', 'where', 'was', 'partnered', 'evil', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'so', 'down', 'pat', 'Watts', 'always', 'good', 'daring', 'damsel', 'distress', 'unafraid', 'fight', 'back', 'Roth', 'just', 'good', 'role', 'arguably', 'poor', 'chimpanzee', 'film', 'discussion', 'dialogue', 'conversational', 'realistic', 'certain', 'things', 'just', 'never', 'gel', 'together', 'Ultimately', 'threats', 'are', 'realistic', 'enough', 'just', 'never', 'threatening', 'feel', 'are', 'watching', 'two', 'spoiled', 'rich', 'boys', 'acting', 'out', 'violent', 'fantasies', 'nothing', 'revelatory', 'ultimately', 'nothing', 'new', 'offer', 'film-goer', 'afore-mentioned', 'Murder', 'Numbers', 'suffered', 'similar', 'fate', 'far', 'superior', 'film', 'certainly', 'especially', 'cinematic', 'cheats', 'end', 'come', 'out', 'more', 'frustrating', 'clever', 'more', 'torture', 'porn', 'not', 'great', 'psychological', 'horror', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Funny', 'Games', 'little', 'more', 'well-acted', 'bloody', 'popcorn', 'entertainment', 'certainly', 'better', 'most', 'horror', 'films', 'there', 'today']",N/A

1158588,A3VLX5Z090RQ0V,B00187FPC2,"Del Keyes ""Elaborate Chattering Nut""","[4, 8]","It comes to no surprise that when dealing with a horror remake, there's gonna be some arguable viewers howling the ever-common ""watch the original"" rant, especially when a movie is reportedly an exact-copy of the original.  I type ""reportedly"" because I never actually saw the original foreign movie, but I figured not many did, so director Michael Haneke decided to reach the non-subtitle-reading audience by having an English-speaking cast and that's all he wrote.  If Haneke wanted to make a name for himself by re-making his cherished project for the Western viewers, then kudos for him; although I'm aware he's not the only director who made a remake of his own original (see ""The Grudge""), this movie is an exception due to my personal bias against PG-13 horror films.""Funny Games"" is clever and subdued for a film easy to pigeon-hole as ""torture porn"", but it is also cruel and tormenting, especially when a wife and child are involved, so the movie's definitely not for everyone.  The movie's story can be easily summed up in one sentence: a rich family gets terrorized by two young men in a sick game of life and death.  However, the ""terror"" part of the film doesn't start off quite soon, and this film does take its time for the psychotic lead Paul and what-his-face (the characters rarely call themselves by their real names) to start the delightful pleasure of torture a family.  In actuality, though, the majority of the film's torture moments happened off-screen, so if you appreciate the fine art of brutality, you might wanna look elsewhere.I can't really comment on the film's main actors.  Naomi Watts and Tim Roth tried their best to portray the unfortunate couple, but they just can't escape the conventions of begging and ""WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?"" lines that's all too familiar in films of its type.  However, the kid in this movie sure knows how to be in pain and make it convincing.  Really, the only interesting people in this movie are the actors playin' the two psychopaths, Michael Pitt (Paul) and the guy playing Paul's partner.  Paul is especially interesting, because not only does he have a calm, amoral demeanor towards his victims, he takes control over everything; I mean, he LITERALLY takes control over everything, and he makes sure the results are in his way.A while ago, I've seen Michael Haneke's other film,Juliette Binoche and The Unknown Stalker.That film shares a few things with this one: the destruction of family values and dragged-out scenes.  ""Funny Games"" has a couple of scenes that take too long for its own good, especially during the halfway point where the family tries to get away...the lack of real suspense from those scenes, along w/ the lack of sound, makes the scenes kinda uninteresting.  The movie's not for everyone not just for the content, but also for its pacing.  This is a slow film.""Funny Games"" does not have a happy ending, and this movie doesn't want the viewer to see a happy ending.  The movie has an odd way of breaking the fourth wall, when Paul is occasionally talking to the audience on who  do we think is going to survive the game or how far he can go w/ the family.  You could say that this movie is cheating and the thought of that infuriates me, but that's what the movie's trying to do.  That's what makes this film so clever...it's a film that does its best to lower our expectations, and although it took many risks, the movie did a good job.",4,The most heartwarming comedy of the season...is NOT what you'll get here,1205625600,"03 16, 2008",2008,3429,"['surprise', 'when', 'dealing', 'horror', 'remake', 'gon', 'be', 'arguable', 'viewers', 'howling', 'ever-common', 'watch', 'original', 'rant', 'especially', 'when', 'movie', 'reportedly', 'exact-copy', 'original', 'type', 'reportedly', 'never', 'actually', 'saw', 'original', 'foreign', 'movie', 'figured', 'not', 'many', 'did', 'director', 'Michael', 'Haneke', 'decided', 'reach', 'non-subtitle-reading', 'audience', 'having', 'English-speaking', 'cast', 'wrote', 'Haneke', 'wanted', 'make', 'name', 're-making', 'cherished', 'project', 'Western', 'viewers', 'then', 'kudos', ""'m"", 'aware', 'not', 'only', 'director', 'who', 'made', 'remake', 'own', 'original', 'see', 'Grudge', 'movie', 'exception', 'due', 'personal', 'bias', 'PG-13', 'horror', 'films', 'Funny', 'Games', 'clever', 'subdued', 'film', 'easy', 'pigeon-hole', 'torture', 'porn', 'also', 'cruel', 'tormenting', 'especially', 'when', 'wife', 'child', 'are', 'involved', 'movie', 'definitely', 'not', 'everyone', 'movie', 'story', 'can', 'be', 'easily', 'summed', 'up', 'one', 'sentence', 'rich', 'family', 'terrorized', 'two', 'young', 'men', 'sick', 'game', 'life', 'death', 'However', 'terror', 'part', 'film', ""n't"", 'start', 'off', 'quite', 'soon', 'film', 'take', 'time', 'psychotic', 'lead', 'Paul', 'what-his-face', 'characters', 'rarely', 'call', 'real', 'names', 'start', 'delightful', 'pleasure', 'torture', 'family', 'actuality', 'though', 'majority', 'film', 'torture', 'moments', 'happened', 'off-screen', 'so', 'appreciate', 'fine', 'art', 'brutality', 'might', 'wan', 'na', 'look', 'elsewhere.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'comment', 'film', 'main', 'actors', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'tried', 'best', 'portray', 'unfortunate', 'couple', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'escape', 'conventions', 'begging', 'WHY', 'ARE', 'YOU', 'DOING', 'THIS', 'lines', 'too', 'familiar', 'films', 'type', 'However', 'kid', 'movie', 'sure', 'how', 'be', 'pain', 'make', 'convincing', 'Really', 'only', 'interesting', 'people', 'movie', 'are', 'actors', 'playin', 'two', 'psychopaths', 'Michael', 'Pitt', 'Paul', 'guy', 'playing', 'Paul', 'partner', 'Paul', 'especially', 'interesting', 'not', 'only', 'have', 'calm', 'amoral', 'demeanor', 'victims', 'control', 'everything', 'mean', 'LITERALLY', 'control', 'everything', 'sure', 'results', 'are', 'way.A', 'ago', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Michael', 'Haneke', 'other', 'film', 'Juliette', 'Binoche', 'Unknown', 'Stalker.That', 'film', 'shares', 'few', 'things', 'one', 'destruction', 'family', 'values', 'dragged-out', 'scenes', 'Funny', 'Games', 'couple', 'scenes', 'take', 'too', 'long', 'own', 'good', 'especially', 'halfway', 'point', 'where', 'family', 'get', 'away', 'lack', 'real', 'suspense', 'scenes', 'lack', 'sound', 'scenes', 'kinda', 'uninteresting', 'movie', 'not', 'everyone', 'not', 'just', 'content', 'also', 'pacing', 'slow', 'film', 'Funny', 'Games', 'not', 'have', 'happy', 'ending', 'movie', ""n't"", 'want', 'viewer', 'see', 'happy', 'ending', 'movie', 'odd', 'way', 'breaking', 'fourth', 'wall', 'when', 'Paul', 'occasionally', 'talking', 'audience', 'who', 'do', 'think', 'going', 'survive', 'game', 'how', 'far', 'can', 'go', 'w/', 'family', 'could', 'say', 'movie', 'cheating', 'thought', 'what', 'movie', 'trying', 'do', 'what', 'film', 'so', 'clever', 'film', 'best', 'lower', 'expectations', 'took', 'many', 'risks', 'movie', 'did', 'good', 'job']",N/A

1158590,AC63924IPU3IS,B00187FPC2,"DKMI ""dkmi""","[1, 1]","OK, much has been said good and bad about this movie.  Some people think ""Funny Games"" is some sort of great artistic statement about violence and our cravings to watch it.  Others think it's simply pure evil with no redeeming story line other than violence.  I guess I kind of agree with both sides in some ways and disagree in others.The film is first rate as far as the acting and direction.  Rather than being some typical Hollywood slasher film like ""Friday the 13th"" that's loaded with humor and sight gags, this movie has a dead serious tone to it.  The two villains are so disturbing that you feel at least part of the terror the family is feeling.  It's actually hard to watch this film, and it's a testament to Haneke's skill that people would describe it as violent.  We see almost no real violence taking place.  Like Quentin Tarantino's ""Reservoir Dogs"", the idea of violence erupting is hanging over every second of the film.  It's excruciating waiting for something to happen, and when something does, we're disappointed in the outcome.  Interestingly, Tim Roth also starred in that film.Where I have a major problem with the film is something that happens near the end.  What seemed like a very real movie about a very unfortunate family and two very disturbed individuals, suddenly took on something I would expect to see in a ""Friday the 13th"" movie.  I don't want to give away what happens, but the seriousness of this film is given a firm kick in the crotch when one outcome is given a mulligan.  Actually, it's the viewer that gets kicked.  For me, everything good about the film ended there.If someone asks me if this movie was any good, I would have a hard time telling them whether or not it was.  You first have to define what you consider good.  The movie succeeded in making me feel uncomfortable while watching it.  It also succeeded in disappointing me.  I don't necessarily need a Hollywood ending.  ""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"" didn't end with ""...and they lived happily ever after"", and it was the perfect ending for that film.  The ending in this film may be some sort of statement, but I don't care much for films that preach to me.  I certainly don't care for being jerked around, which is exactly what Haneke did with the remote control scene.  If you want to watch a movie that makes you feel terribly uncomfortable for two hours and delivers no payoff, then you might want to check this one out.  If you want to see a good psychological thriller with a creepy villain but a more interesting story, tryThe Talented Mr. Ripley.  Another great film that does a better showing of just how despicable a human can be, check outBefore the Devil Knows You're Dead.  The stories in those films are far superior to this one.  If you want to see ""Cape Fear"" end with Max Cady killing the whole family, then this is the movie for you.",3,Good or Bad Movie?

1158593,A280GY5UVUS2QH,B00187FPC2,Doug Anderson,"[14, 20]","Although this might be a ""shot-by-shot transcription of the original"" 1997 Austrian film by the same director (Michael Haneke), the fact that this is not a small foreign or independent film but a film with considerable studio backing makes this a whole new kind of game. If the original film was mocking Hollywood and Hollywood audience expectations, then what does it mean when Hollywood finances the re-make? Added to this is the fact that Naomi Watts & Tim Roth are high caliber stars. This turns this re-make into a different kind of game (Watts & Roth are big game). We do not expect ""stars"" to be used and abused in quite this way, nor do we expect them to be denied any kind of retalitory or redemptive acts of their own, and it takes some getting used to; random acts of unexplainable violence and powerless victimized stars upset our idea of order & justice. And, of course, this is the point. Does this make for a good evenings entertainment? For most people, probably not.In some ways its an advantage that Michael Haneke (The Music Teacher, Cache) is not yet a household name here in the states, because American viewers attending or renting this film might not yet know what kind of director this is, and just what kinds of themes he deals with (or games he plays). And so their expectations will be in just the right place for Haneke to exploit them. The problem with this plan is that audiences do not like to be toyed with & exploited (hence the low ratings this film is receiving). Nor do audiences like to be lectured at and Haneke does tend to come across as a moralist at times pointing his accusatory finger at us for having the appetites and desires that we do. This might be a problem for some (most) viewers.I think, possibly, this film is supposed to make us think about violence and our own predilection for it (not necessarily for committing acts of violence but for viewing them). Some theorize that those who view violence, the silent witness or ""innocent"" bystander, are silent accomplices to the crime. While watching the film we might ask ourselves who we are identifying with: the innocent wealthy family or the young home invaders. And, we might also ask ourselves to what extent we are living out our own fantasies in the films that we watch. The answer is probably that we identify with both the innocent victims and with the young rebels and that on some level we live vicariously through both sets of actors. Many of us that do not sit at the top of the economic ladder (might on some unconscious level) resent those that do. But most of us are not criminals and do not really wish anyone harm. So, what is it that we really want to see in a film like this? Do we want to see the wealthy punished? What do we do with these unconscious impulses that, when acknowledged, only make us ashamed of ourselves? We watch films.I think it might be true that a good number of us do like a good horror or thriller now and then, and part of the appeal is that we enjoy the liberation from our normal societal pressures & contraints & we enjoy the reversals of fortune & the feeling that, thankfully, it is not us  that all the bad stuff is happening to. But a horror film or a thriller is not reality, right?  These films are simple escapism, a chance to indulge in the pure fantasy of trespassing into the forbidden & satisfying our most repressed desires. These films have no connection to reality, and that makes our brief attractions and flirtations with them alright, right? But is the watching of the films that we watch all just a harmless fantasy, revealing nothing of importance about us? That is the question.At the end of most horror films and thrillers there is some kind of rational explanation, and catharsis, and a return to the status quo, and, perhaps, an expiation of guilt. But theres no return to the status quo in Funny Games, nor a release of any kind. The film's violence (though not actually shown) is unrelenting & leads nowhere but to more violence; its reversals are permanent; its games with reality become reality. Unlike most films, this film does not put everything back the way it was. So where does that leave us viewers?It leaves us to contemplate what we just watched. The intention was not just to provide us with yet another cliched film experience but to ask us to do something with the experience.So, has the director's ambitious intention been realized? Has he achieved what he set out to achieve? If you find yourself engaging in the kind of conversation with self or fellow viewers that I just had, then yes. If not, then no.",4,The More You Think About it the Better it Gets,1213228800,"06 12, 2008",2008,4593,"['might', 'be', 'shot-by-shot', 'transcription', 'original', '1997', 'Austrian', 'film', 'same', 'director', 'Michael', 'Haneke', 'fact', 'not', 'small', 'foreign', 'independent', 'film', 'film', 'considerable', 'studio', 'backing', 'whole', 'new', 'kind', 'game', 'original', 'film', 'was', 'mocking', 'Hollywood', 'Hollywood', 'audience', 'expectations', 'then', 'what', 'mean', 'when', 'Hollywood', 're-make', 'Added', 'fact', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'are', 'high', 'caliber', 'stars', 're-make', 'different', 'kind', 'game', 'Watts', 'Roth', 'are', 'big', 'game', 'do', 'not', 'expect', 'stars', 'be', 'used', 'abused', 'quite', 'way', 'do', 'expect', 'be', 'denied', 'kind', 'retalitory', 'redemptive', 'acts', 'own', 'getting', 'used', 'random', 'acts', 'unexplainable', 'violence', 'powerless', 'victimized', 'stars', 'upset', 'idea', 'order', 'justice', 'course', 'point', 'make', 'good', 'evenings', 'entertainment', 'most', 'people', 'probably', 'ways', 'advantage', 'Michael', 'Haneke', 'Music', 'Teacher', 'Cache', 'not', 'yet', 'household', 'name', 'here', 'states', 'American', 'viewers', 'attending', 'renting', 'film', 'might', 'not', 'yet', 'know', 'what', 'kind', 'director', 'just', 'what', 'themes', 'games', 'so', 'expectations', 'will', 'be', 'just', 'right', 'place', 'Haneke', 'exploit', 'problem', 'plan', 'audiences', 'do', 'not', 'like', 'be', 'toyed', 'exploited', 'hence', 'low', 'ratings', 'film', 'receiving', 'do', 'audiences', 'like', 'be', 'lectured', 'Haneke', 'tend', 'come', 'moralist', 'times', 'pointing', 'accusatory', 'finger', 'having', 'appetites', 'desires', 'do', 'might', 'be', 'problem', 'most', 'viewers.I', 'think', 'possibly', 'film', 'supposed', 'make', 'think', 'violence', 'own', 'predilection', 'not', 'necessarily', 'committing', 'acts', 'violence', 'viewing', 'theorize', 'who', 'view', 'violence', 'silent', 'witness', 'innocent', 'bystander', 'are', 'silent', 'accomplices', 'crime', 'watching', 'film', 'might', 'ask', 'ourselves', 'who', 'are', 'identifying', 'innocent', 'wealthy', 'family', 'young', 'home', 'invaders', 'might', 'also', 'ask', 'what', 'extent', 'are', 'living', 'out', 'own', 'fantasies', 'films', 'watch', 'answer', 'probably', 'identify', 'innocent', 'victims', 'young', 'rebels', 'level', 'live', 'vicariously', 'sets', 'actors', 'Many', 'do', 'not', 'sit', 'top', 'economic', 'ladder', 'might', 'unconscious', 'level', 'resent', 'do', 'most', 'are', 'not', 'criminals', 'do', 'not', 'really', 'wish', 'anyone', 'harm', 'So', 'what', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'film', 'Do', 'want', 'see', 'wealthy', 'punished', 'What', 'do', 'do', 'unconscious', 'impulses', 'when', 'acknowledged', 'only', 'make', 'ashamed', 'ourselves', 'watch', 'films.I', 'think', 'might', 'be', 'true', 'good', 'number', 'do', 'good', 'horror', 'thriller', 'now', 'then', 'part', 'appeal', 'enjoy', 'liberation', 'normal', 'societal', 'pressures', 'contraints', 'enjoy', 'reversals', 'fortune', 'feeling', 'thankfully', 'not', 'bad', 'stuff', 'happening', 'horror', 'film', 'thriller', 'not', 'reality', 'right', 'films', 'are', 'simple', 'escapism', 'chance', 'indulge', 'pure', 'fantasy', 'trespassing', 'forbidden', 'satisfying', 'most', 'repressed', 'desires', 'films', 'have', 'connection', 'reality', 'brief', 'attractions', 'flirtations', 'alright', 'right', 'watching', 'films', 'watch', 'just', 'harmless', 'fantasy', 'revealing', 'nothing', 'importance', 'question.At', 'end', 'most', 'horror', 'films', 'thrillers', 'kind', 'rational', 'explanation', 'catharsis', 'return', 'status', 'quo', 'perhaps', 'expiation', 'guilt', 'return', 'status', 'quo', 'Funny', 'Games', 'release', 'kind', 'film', 'violence', 'not', 'actually', 'shown', 'unrelenting', 'leads', 'nowhere', 'more', 'violence', 'reversals', 'are', 'permanent', 'games', 'reality', 'become', 'reality', 'most', 'films', 'film', 'not', 'put', 'everything', 'back', 'way', 'was', 'So', 'where', 'leave', 'viewers', 'contemplate', 'what', 'just', 'watched', 'intention', 'was', 'not', 'just', 'provide', 'yet', 'cliched', 'film', 'experience', 'ask', 'do', 'something', 'experience.So', 'director', 'ambitious', 'intention', 'been', 'realized', 'Has', 'achieved', 'what', 'set', 'out', 'achieve', 'find', 'engaging', 'kind', 'conversation', 'self', 'fellow', 'viewers', 'just', 'had', 'then', 'yes', 'not', 'then']",N/A

What this film is, however, is an expertly directed and beautifully acted exploration of human evil.The plot of the film revolves around a family of three (including wife Anne, husband George and son George Jr.) who are degraded, brutalized and tortured by two perversely polite, pretty young preppies at their summer home. Unlike the current ""torture porn"" trend in horror films, ""Funny Games"" relies on psychological terror instead of gory stunts, and the result is that's it's a thousand times more disturbing.When George asks the two young men why they're doing this to them, they mock him by coming up with trite, talk-show-psychology explanations. Still, it's profound. As the viewer, I started asking myself lots of ""why"" questions ... why do human beings do cruel things? Why do we torture each other, degrade each other, humiliate each other? And, after all the cruelty we inflict on each other in real life, why do we then want to watch it on a screen?Much ado has been made about Michael Haneke's willingness to break the fourth wall in ""Funny Games"", having the villians occasionally directly address the viewer.

In it, an upper-class family -- father George (Tim Roth), mother Ann (Watts) and son George Jr. (Devon Gearhart) -- arrives at their summer home on a lake in an unnamed New England community. The opening scenes in the house have an uneasy, Kubrick-ian air about them (the walls are white and sterile-looking, and the film is almost entirely void of any instrumental score or musical cues), but it is hard to imagine even Kubrick coming up with something as unsettling as what comes next.Two young men decked in their best country-club garb -- Polo shirts, shorts, tennis shoes and golf gloves, all white -- arrive at the house and ask to borrow some eggs. By the time Ann and George realize the two don't exactly seem like the cooking type, one of them grabs a golf club and breaks George's leg with it. With minimal resistance, they take the family hostage and proceed to torture them with a series of mind games, depraved humiliation and, well, a little bit of actual torture.Neither ""Paul"" (Michael Pitt) nor ""Peter"" (Brady Corbet) -- their real names are never given -- offer any credible explanation for their sadistic actions, which is the first clue that ""Funny Games"" is not your typical psycho-killer(s) flick. The real alarm bell, however, comes when Paul breaks the ""fourth wall"" and faces the camera to ask the audience, ""What do you think? Think they stand a chance?""Once you realize the film is self-aware, the viewing experience is taken to an entirely different level. Haneke makes you complicit in whatever happens to the family, just by virtue of having paid your $8 and choosing to stay and watch as the violence escalates further and further. He uses this movie-that-knows-it's-a-movie device to devastating effect, not once letting you -- or the (doomed?) family -- off the hook.The ""Scream"" films were hailed as groundbreaking because they took all the hallmarks of horror films and ""cleverly"" presented them as knowing winks from the director. Kid's stuff. Where ""Funny Games"" truly triumphs over Wes Craven and his ilk is in its unfazed determination to deny viewers any breathing room, dangling moments of hope over their heads before snatching them away like two brothers playing keep-away from their younger sibling. Rest assured, cinematic convention has no place here.It is worth mentioning that there is actually very little on-screen violence in ""Funny Games."" Sometimes the camera pans away right before the devastation, and other times it follows Peter or Paul into another room while the other continues the carnage. This, again, only serves to make the entire experience all the more disturbing.The final shot, long after you've lost the last shred of your faith in humanity, is a freeze frame of Paul staring menacingly at the camera as a loud, angry punk song plays into the closing credits. The look on his face is a chilling final reminder that, like the film's tagline reads, ""You brought this on yourself.""",5,Bleak thriller 'Funny Games' nothing to laugh about,1215043200,"07 3, 2008",2008,3920,"['Now', 'what', 'call', 'Olympic', 'spirit', 'one', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'deranged', 'captors', 'end', 'Funny', 'Games', 'frantically', 'cut', 'ropes', 'bind', 'hands', 'somehow', 'escape', 'sailboat', 'middle', 'deserted', 'lake.The', 'kidnapper', 'referring', 'last-ditch', 'effort', 'survive', 'unrelenting', 'horrors', 'first', '100', 'minutes', 'bleak', 'emotionally', 'jarring', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'addressing', 'audience', 'directly', 'having', 'mettle', 'sit', 'whole', 'thing', 'themselves.Make', 'mistake', 'should', 'find', 'watching', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'one', 'second', 'can', 'escape', 'hopelessness', 'absolutely', 'single', 'frame', 'just', ""'re"", 'seeing', 'comfort', 'stadium', 'seating', 'local', 'theater', 'Funny', 'Games', 'English-language', 'frame-for-frame', 'remake', 'German', 'film', 'same', 'name', 'written', 'directed', '1997', 'Michael', 'Haneke', 'upper-class', 'family', 'father', 'George', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'mother', 'Ann', 'Watts', 'son', 'George', 'Jr.', 'Devon', 'Gearhart', 'summer', 'home', 'lake', 'unnamed', 'New', 'England', 'community', 'opening', 'scenes', 'house', 'have', 'uneasy', 'Kubrick-ian', 'air', 'walls', 'are', 'white', 'sterile-looking', 'film', 'almost', 'entirely', 'void', 'instrumental', 'score', 'musical', 'cues', 'hard', 'imagine', 'even', 'Kubrick', 'coming', 'up', 'something', 'as', 'unsettling', 'what', 'next.Two', 'young', 'men', 'decked', 'best', 'country-club', 'garb', 'Polo', 'shirts', 'shorts', 'tennis', 'shoes', 'golf', 'gloves', 'white', 'arrive', 'house', 'ask', 'borrow', 'eggs', 'time', 'Ann', 'George', 'realize', 'two', 'do', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'seem', 'cooking', 'type', 'one', 'grabs', 'golf', 'club', 'breaks', 'George', 'leg', 'minimal', 'resistance', 'take', 'family', 'hostage', 'proceed', 'torture', 'series', 'mind', 'games', 'depraved', 'humiliation', 'well', 'little', 'bit', 'actual', 'torture.Neither', 'Paul', 'Michael', 'Pitt', 'Peter', 'Brady', 'Corbet', 'real', 'names', 'are', 'never', 'given', 'offer', 'credible', 'explanation', 'sadistic', 'actions', 'first', 'clue', 'Funny', 'Games', 'not', 'typical', 'psycho-killer', 's', 'flick', 'real', 'alarm', 'bell', 'however', 'when', 'Paul', 'fourth', 'wall', 'camera', 'ask', 'audience', 'What', 'do', 'think', 'Think', 'stand', 'chance', 'realize', 'film', 'self-aware', 'viewing', 'experience', 'taken', 'entirely', 'different', 'level', 'Haneke', 'complicit', 'happens', 'family', 'just', 'virtue', 'having', 'paid', '8', 'choosing', 'stay', 'watch', 'violence', 'further', 'further', ""movie-that-knows-it's-a-movie"", 'device', 'devastating', 'effect', 'not', 'once', 'letting', 'doomed', 'family', 'hook.The', 'Scream', 'films', 'were', 'hailed', 'groundbreaking', 'took', 'hallmarks', 'horror', 'films', 'cleverly', 'presented', 'knowing', 'winks', 'director', 'Kid', 'stuff', 'Where', 'Funny', 'Games', 'truly', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'ilk', 'unfazed', 'determination', 'deny', 'viewers', 'breathing', 'room', 'dangling', 'moments', 'hope', 'heads', 'snatching', 'away', 'two', 'brothers', 'playing', 'keep-away', 'younger', 'sibling', 'Rest', 'assured', 'cinematic', 'convention', 'place', 'here.It', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'actually', 'very', 'little', 'on-screen', 'violence', 'Funny', 'Games', 'camera', 'away', 'right', 'devastation', 'other', 'times', 'Peter', 'Paul', 'room', 'other', 'carnage', 'again', 'only', 'make', 'entire', 'experience', 'more', 'disturbing.The', 'final', 'shot', 'long', ""'ve"", 'lost', 'last', 'shred', 'faith', 'humanity', 'freeze', 'frame', 'Paul', 'staring', 'menacingly', 'camera', 'loud', 'angry', 'punk', 'song', 'closing', 'credits', 'look', 'face', 'chilling', 'final', 'reminder', 'film', 'tagline', 'brought']",N/A
1158597,A5QCKO0LL1D5E,B00187FPC2,dv_forever,"[5, 6]","Watching ""Funny Games"" from 2007, Michael Haneke's remake of his own movie from 1998, is a strange experience. One wonders why so much talent is spent on so little of merit to humanity or to art. I don't mean to sound too pretentious but the intent of this movie escapes me. How much do the filmmakers here despise the audience and what is the worth of this film's existence? I ask that question often about bad Hollywood movies, pointless artsy flicks from Europe and of course the horror torture genre in general. But one wonders why make this film if you've already made it before a decade prior? To create two unpleasant experiences with the same material or to make a greater likelihood of having this movie seen by Americans? Perhaps a personal disgust at American movies and audiences? Should Pasolini have remade ""Salo: 180 Days of Sodom""? Well, he couldn't have anyway, he was murdered not too long after.Back to Haneke. This guy is clearly an auteur. He has an eye for detail, he knows how to frame a shot, his minimalistic use of music is terrific and his control of his actors is right on the spot. He knows what he is doing and right from the beginning, a viewer is aware that an artist is at work, not a mere hack. But to ask the motivation for this film's existence is like asking why the two young home invaders in the home torture and terrorize their victims. They laugh and play and eventually concede that they are doing it for no reason whatsoever. We are to take from this film that life is pointless, meaningless, that humanity is worthless trash and that people who watch movies are scum and should have the director and the characters onscreen spit in the face of the audience and mock them at every turn. It's all unpleasant for no reason.Nihilism is an attractive outlook on life, especially to young people who want to ""rebel"" against something. Why not rebel against everything, against all sense and meaning? But as one grows into adulthood, as one grows in the artistic process, shouldn't there be some sort of redemption from despair and nothingness? Apparently not, as Haneke's body of work tends to focus on the ugly aspects of life. If Haneke was in his twenties or thirties, I could sympathize somewhat, most torture flicks are made by young filmmakers. Haneke was actually 65 at the time of ""Funny Games"". His best film that I have seen is ""The Piano Teacher"" which had many of these ugly overtones but came together as a more interesting character study nonetheless. One critical idea is that he examines the failure of modern society and the human capacity for depravity. I have seen stronger, more morally courageous directors tackle these same themes through the decades. Haneke ends up with decadence and misery, not much else.The merits of this film are the expert technique, precise and secure. Tim Roth and Naomi Watts aren't given much to do other than play miserable victims and the two young psychopaths played by Michael Pitt and Bradley Corbet are repulsively effective. Pitt's character in two or three shots break the fourth wall and talks to the audience and manipulates the timeline and these scenes felt contrived and premeditated. They felt like knowing, theatrical winks and one feels the machinery of the screenplay working like gears. I think it lowered the film but others may disagree and feel it's artistically justified.If I was still a teenager, I would probably enjoy this film more as I was working through my own nihilism for quite some time. Now in my mid-twenties I am basically sick of ugliness and hopelessness, so this movie is more than annoying. Nowadays I much prefer glorious art or work that tries to transcend the human experience and enter some kind of spiritual plane. I have to say ""Funny Games"" is more honest about it's intentions than Hollywood filth like ""Hostel"" or the ""Saw"" series. Those movies are exploitative trash that are soaked with blood and gore and then try to teach the audience a trite moral lesson at the end.

And never before had I personally felt so responsible for it. If Michael Haneke's point is that we as an audience become active participants in the violence the second we purchase our ticket for a film like this, his point is made rather forcefully. In the hands of the abundantly talented Naomi Watts and Tim Roth, who evoke pain and humiliation with grimaces and tears so compelling that they turn to daggers aimed at the audience itself, the film strips violence of any glamor it may have possessed as entirely as possible in a culture that shovels out billions every year in its name. Toying with the audience's conflicted emotions--the desire to witness cruelty mixing with a desperate hope that its victims will make it out alive--the movie feels like a murder mystery in which YOU, the reader, are guilty of the crime. ""You,"" by paying to sit with your popcorn and 50-gallon soda to watch a film you knew contained unmitigated torture and death, are responsible for the victims' plight.

But immediately on arriving to their lakeside home they are visited by a strange young lad Peter (Brady Corbet) who asks to borrow eggs for their next-door neighbor.  Soon Peter's mishaps are magnified when his friend Paul (Michael Pitt) joins him in a rather preposterous game of arguing over trite situations that result in Peter and Paul (malignantly sterile in appearance in white shorts and shirts and gloves) moving into the 'funny games ' that are aimed at total destruction of Ann, George and Georgie.  It is not funny, it is not credible, and yes, it does become annoying in the manner in which the writing for Ann and George makes them into fools for going along with the 'games' as long as they do.Watts and Roth are wasted in this film but Pitt and Corbet manage performances that kick us in the gut - as these oily creatures are meant to do.

It shows what happens when someone disregards social norms and that's absolutely terrifying--the passive aggressiveness of 'Peter' and 'Paul,' (though they are known by many other names) is unnerving in that you never know what they want to do.

1158608,A1Y0HX12MCT6OR,B00187FPC2,I'm Right,"[18, 22]","CONGRATULATIONS! That was the point.Funny Games, if you've never seen this the first thing you probably noticed about it was the overwhelming amount of negative reviews which is why I would say Funny Games is less a movie and more of an experience to torture the audience as much as the victims are tortured. An upper class family are terrorized by two psychopaths in their summer villa. That's the story, but it's not what the story is, it's how it's told.I've condemned other movies for being manipulative and exploitative, such as The Woman or We Need to Talk About Kevin. Funny Games is also manipulative and exploitative, however it doesn't use those tactics simply for plot convenience but to tell you a tired and true message in the most visceral way possible, while The Woman used cheap manipulation to make you hate white men and We Need to Talk About Kevin used piss-poor parenting to make Kevin look like an evil mega-genius.A reviewer on here noted that people who liked Hostel and Saw will probably enjoy this film, but I'd say it's quite the contrary. Those movies use a slap-dash mystery plot, extreme violence/gore, and some sort of resolution at the end, all the while entertaining you with the over-the-top deaths. Funny Games has no violence, almost no plot, and no resolution, it's all just sick mind games; and the reason it's so effective is because it sets up age-old slasher tactics to make the audience cheer for the family while booing and hissing at the bad guys. Instead of getting a nice happy resolution with maybe a few unimportant side-characters getting picked off in the process, Haneke makes you endure each agonizing second of the humiliation and torture and then gives you no pay-off, effectively s***ting on typical expectations. Then there's the infamous 'remote control' scene, where one of the bad guys gets shot then the other rewinds back far enough to save his buddies life and thwart (yet again) the families' retaliation, you wanted to see a family getting tortured? That's exactly what you're getting.I've spent quite some time mulling this movie over, why I thought it was effective, what makes it a different type of manipulation, etc, and this movie still baffles angers and confuses me. As a film-lover that is a great thing, a movie made purely for you to hate and condemn, and if you're looking to be entertained you definately picked the wrong movie, but if you're looking for a brutal and sadistic experience (and I believe more people are then they would care to admit) and can look past what this movie is but what this movie evokes in people, than you can admire Funny Games for doing what it sets out to do without pulling any punches.So next time you look at that low score, just consider what MIchael Haneke once said ""If the film is a success, it will be because audiences misunderstood the meaning behind it"".",5,If you hated this movie...,1339545600,"06 13, 2012",2012,2872,"['CONGRATULATIONS', 'was', 'point.Funny', 'Games', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'first', 'thing', 'probably', 'noticed', 'was', 'overwhelming', 'amount', 'negative', 'reviews', 'why', 'would', 'say', 'Funny', 'Games', 'less', 'movie', 'more', 'experience', 'torture', 'audience', 'as', 'much', 'victims', 'are', 'tortured', 'upper', 'class', 'family', 'are', 'terrorized', 'two', 'psychopaths', 'summer', 'villa', 'story', 'not', 'what', 'story', 'how', 'told.I', ""'ve"", 'condemned', 'other', 'movies', 'being', 'manipulative', 'exploitative', 'such', 'Woman', 'Need', 'Talk', 'Kevin', 'Funny', 'Games', 'also', 'manipulative', 'exploitative', 'however', ""n't"", 'use', 'tactics', 'simply', 'plot', 'convenience', 'tell', 'tired', 'true', 'message', 'most', 'visceral', 'way', 'possible', 'Woman', 'used', 'cheap', 'manipulation', 'make', 'hate', 'white', 'men', 'Need', 'Talk', 'Kevin', 'used', 'piss-poor', 'parenting', 'make', 'Kevin', 'look', 'evil', 'mega-genius.A', 'reviewer', 'here', 'noted', 'people', 'who', 'liked', 'Hostel', 'Saw', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'film', ""'d"", 'say', 'contrary', 'movies', 'use', 'slap-dash', 'mystery', 'plot', 'extreme', 'violence/gore', 'sort', 'resolution', 'end', 'while', 'entertaining', 'over-the-top', 'deaths', 'Funny', 'Games', 'violence', 'almost', 'plot', 'resolution', 'just', 'sick', 'mind', 'games', 'reason', 'so', 'effective', 'up', 'age-old', 'slasher', 'tactics', 'make', 'audience', 'cheer', 'family', 'booing', 'hissing', 'bad', 'guys', 'Instead', 'getting', 'nice', 'happy', 'resolution', 'maybe', 'few', 'unimportant', 'side-characters', 'getting', 'picked', 'off', 'process', 'Haneke', 'endure', 'agonizing', 'second', 'humiliation', 'torture', 'then', 'pay-off', 'effectively', 's***ting', 'typical', 'expectations', 'Then', 'infamous', 'control', 'scene', 'where', 'one', 'bad', 'guys', 'shot', 'then', 'other', 'rewinds', 'back', 'far', 'enough', 'save', 'buddies', 'life', 'thwart', 'yet', 'again', 'families', 'retaliation', 'wanted', 'see', 'family', 'getting', 'tortured', 'exactly', 'what', ""'re"", 'getting.I', ""'ve"", 'spent', 'quite', 'time', 'mulling', 'movie', 'why', 'thought', 'was', 'effective', 'what', 'different', 'type', 'manipulation', 'etc', 'movie', 'still', 'angers', 'confuses', 'film-lover', 'great', 'thing', 'movie', 'made', 'purely', 'hate', 'condemn', ""'re"", 'looking', 'be', 'entertained', 'definately', 'picked', 'wrong', 'movie', ""'re"", 'looking', 'brutal', 'sadistic', 'experience', 'believe', 'more', 'people', 'are', 'then', 'would', 'care', 'admit', 'can', 'look', 'past', 'what', 'movie', 'what', 'movie', 'people', 'can', 'admire', 'Funny', 'Games', 'doing', 'what', 'out', 'do', 'pulling', 'punches.So', 'next', 'time', 'look', 'low', 'score', 'just', 'consider', 'what', 'MIchael', 'Haneke', 'once', 'said', 'film', 'success', 'will', 'be', 'because', 'audiences', 'misunderstood', 'meaning']",N/A

1158610,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B00187FPC2,Jason,"[1, 2]","Let me preface this review by saying that I almost always cheer for the bad guy.  I want Freddy to gut the moronic teens while making wise-cracks, Michael Myers to slowly stalk anyone who'd dare mess with a masked mute, and I'm clearly partial to Jason Vorhees and his ongoing mission to rid the world of Darwin candidates who visit Crystal Lake.Having said that, Funny Games pretty much sucks.  It's only funny in a ""tragically funny"" sort of way (not that it was trying to be).  It's not scary in the least bit, unless the preposterousness of the plot is included - THAT'S scary.  The entire movie, the protagonists and antagonists, the message and delivery, it's all pointless.  Don't let the over-interpreters fool you.  Pointless.Basically, two yuppie sociopaths (Brady Corbet and Michael Pitt) hold a vacationing family (Naomi Watts, Time Roth, and Devon Gearhart) hostage in their vacation home and play violent games with them.  In the type of place that families regularly discuss subtleties of the schooner, where schmucks in $200 golf gloves are ubiquitous, one never expects disturbance to the upper class, serene suburban utopia.  So, in that sense, the disturbance to the norm, essentially the unorthodox, is perhaps frightening to some.Aside from the acting, which was very competent and believable (especially Watts' performance), the creative filming techniques are the only thing worthy of exposition.Setting the violent scenes off-camera is often a great idea.  It's perhaps one of the best aspects ofScarfaceand why the chainsaw scene is so disturbing.  In this movie, however, it came off weak, like an option used for someone without an intelligent, cohesive option available.  Breaking the ""4th Wall"" can be used with great success - see the clever usage inFerris Bueller's Day Off.  When this is done to force-feed viewers a message, however, it lessens effectiveness and importance.  Finally, rewinding a scene during the middle of a movie, as part of the movie, is completely ludicrous and irksome unless the filming is for anotherWayne's Worldsequel.The overall lesson is one of contempt for viewers who enjoy the proliferation of the voyeuristic sadism genre.  Just like school, however, if the lecture is slow, tedious, and boring (it was), the lesson is lost as the audience falls asleep (I did).",2,Pretentious torture porn,1224979200,"10 26, 2008",2008,2326,"['Let', 'preface', 'review', 'saying', 'almost', 'always', 'cheer', 'bad', 'guy', 'want', 'Freddy', 'gut', 'moronic', 'teens', 'making', 'wise-cracks', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'slowly', 'stalk', 'anyone', 'who', ""'d"", 'dare', 'mess', 'masked', 'mute', ""'m"", 'clearly', 'partial', 'Jason', 'Vorhees', 'ongoing', 'mission', 'rid', 'world', 'Darwin', 'candidates', 'who', 'visit', 'Crystal', 'Lake.Having', 'said', 'Funny', 'Games', 'pretty', 'much', 'sucks', 'only', 'funny', 'tragically', 'funny', 'sort', 'way', 'not', 'was', 'trying', 'be', 'not', 'scary', 'least', 'bit', 'preposterousness', 'plot', 'included', 'scary', 'entire', 'movie', 'protagonists', 'antagonists', 'message', 'delivery', 'pointless', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'over-interpreters', 'fool', 'Pointless.Basically', 'two', 'yuppie', 'sociopaths', 'Brady', 'Corbet', 'Michael', 'Pitt', 'hold', 'vacationing', 'family', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'Time', 'Roth', 'Devon', 'Gearhart', 'hostage', 'vacation', 'home', 'play', 'violent', 'games', 'type', 'place', 'families', 'regularly', 'discuss', 'subtleties', 'schooner', 'where', 'schmucks', '200', 'golf', 'gloves', 'are', 'ubiquitous', 'one', 'never', 'disturbance', 'upper', 'class', 'serene', 'suburban', 'utopia', 'So', 'sense', 'disturbance', 'norm', 'essentially', 'unorthodox', 'perhaps', 'frightening', 'some.Aside', 'acting', 'was', 'very', 'competent', 'believable', 'especially', 'Watts', 'performance', 'creative', 'filming', 'techniques', 'are', 'only', 'thing', 'worthy', 'exposition.Setting', 'violent', 'scenes', 'off-camera', 'often', 'great', 'idea', 'perhaps', 'one', 'best', 'aspects', 'ofScarfaceand', 'why', 'chainsaw', 'scene', 'so', 'disturbing', 'movie', 'however', 'came', 'off', 'weak', 'option', 'used', 'someone', 'intelligent', 'cohesive', 'option', 'available', 'Breaking', '4th', 'Wall', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'great', 'success', 'see', 'clever', 'usage', 'inFerris', 'Bueller', 'Day', 'Off', 'When', 'done', 'force-feed', 'viewers', 'message', 'however', 'effectiveness', 'importance', 'Finally', 'rewinding', 'scene', 'middle', 'movie', 'part', 'movie', 'completely', 'ludicrous', 'irksome', 'filming', 'anotherWayne', 'Worldsequel.The', 'overall', 'lesson', 'one', 'contempt', 'viewers', 'who', 'enjoy', 'proliferation', 'voyeuristic', 'sadism', 'genre', 'Just', 'school', 'however', 'lecture', 'slow', 'tedious', 'boring', 'was', 'lesson', 'lost', 'audience', 'asleep', 'did']",N/A
1158611,A2VRAT69JDAD3W,B00187FPC2,"Jason Whitt ""Whittmeister""","[10, 15]","Funny Games is a strange film.  In fact, the term film only applies because (I assume) it was shot on film.  Yet, it is intended as anything but a story.  There is no arc.  No discernible first, second or third act.  Instead, the audience (who is on trial throughout) is served an enormous helping of judgment.  You see, Funny Games is more of an excercise or experiment than a movie.  We, the audience show up expecting to be scared or at least mildly entertained by a good story.  Instead we are in so many words, accused of being violence-hungry heathens whose patronage of popular film implicates us as accomplices in the real-life violence we see every day.I suspect most movie goers patently resent this implication.  Violence and cruelty have been a part of the human condition since we've walked the Earth.  Further, violence is a central component in some of the most famous literary works ever written (the Bible comes to mind).The director of funny Games argues that violence exists in cinema (specifically American cinema) because we demand it, crave it, lust for it.  He attempts to prove this by making a movie devoid of any story, that instead centers entirely around senseless violence.  The idea being that our mere presence in front of the screen proves our guilt.  I am  confounded by this judgmental theory because it flies completely in the face of the most basic tenet of art...that art exists to comment on life.  Violence and death happen in real life.  Thus it should be reasonably expected that violence would be seen in art.  And to no one's surprise it is seen in art, film being no exception.  But so are love, pride, sadness, anger, depression, kindness, apathy, and all the other adjectives that sum up the whole of the human condition.The director clearly has a very ugly view of humans in general.  No doubt humans are capable of unspeakable violence.  Yet I submit that violence in film represents nothing more than a vehicle to achieve a desired response in viewers.  People do not crave violence on film for its' own sake.  If that were the case there would be no need to include plots.  We could simply line people up and slaughter them then roll credits.  While the definition of entertainment may vary from one person to another, the simple truth is that in viewing a film, we seek to occupy our minds with compelling ideas, behaviors and situations.  At their best, these cinematic experiences invoke thoughts and emotions which serve ultimately to remind us that we are alive.  A good laugh perhaps.  Or a good scare.  Perhaps a story that reinforces our belief that good things happen to good people.  Or maybe that bad things happen to all people irrespective of their moral compass.  What we do not require is violence for violence's sake (which ironically is just what Funny Games is), nor is it necessarily true that film violence translates into real life violence.  Last I checked, people have been killing and hurting one another since people have been in existence.  Film has only been around a scant 100 years of that time.",1,"Social Experiment?

Haneke is Trash and nothing more. He is a very disturbed person who has no business making movies. What a waste of time.

1158613,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B00187FPC2,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[17, 24]","I've seen the original to this film and I love it. The first thing I really enjoyed about this film, was the director's decision to make Ann and George very ordinary and very vulnerable, and because of Roth's and Watts' brilliant performances it was equally terrifying. Before watching this I had assumed I would be cheering for Tim Roth the entire time - being a huge Reservoir Dogs fan and all - since he was one of the reasons I was attracted to this film in the first place. As it turns out, Naomi Watts was far better in this film than Roth, and showed audiences that she is one of the best actresses working today.Brady Corbet as the childish and shy Peter seemed at first to be a horrible casting decision. His first scene was fantastic, then for awhile he didn't contribute anything besides being the muscle for Paul's plan. After the movie started to pick up speed however, he really started to shine through, and I wouldn't be surprised if this role lands him a few more parts in the genre. Michael Pitt's performance as the mastermind behind the operation was flawless. The way he manage to stay calm and polite and yet, come off as a complete sociopath was fantastic. Paul repeatedly breaks the 4th wall to talk to the audience; asking for their approval, whether they think they've gone far enough, or sometimes just to smile maniacally. At first I thought it took away from the film, then I came to realize it only added to the message of the film, that we as the audience want to be completely shocked, and the only reason we watch movies like this are to feel sorry for the people involved. Or perhaps we are on the other side of the fence and want to see these people suffer. Whatever your fancy is, I'm sure you'll be thoroughly satisfied with this movie.It's very obvious throughout this movie that director Haneke wanted to make a film as a social commentary on media violence. The dialogue between characters very much portrayed this concept, and while simple and sparse, it was very realistic and made certain scenes very hard to watch at times. The characters act very rational, and while there are a couple instances where they do something out of character, overall they are believable and as I said, realistic portrayals of both sides to this equation. This film felt much more like an art film than a psychological thriller. Many scenes lasted for upwards of 5 or 6 minutes with no cuts, and there was very little camera movement. Almost every shot was stationary, and either completely symmetrical, or completely out of balance depending on the particular mood of the scene. Also, this film had very little color, as everything was a very neutral tone, making certain items and effects standout more than they normally would have. What little violence there is in the film is almost entirely off screen, and left to the viewer's imagination. This movie was not made with the intent of grossing out an audience with over the top gore in a horrific situation. It was merely to poke and pry at our minds to see - and possibly to wake us up to - just what we as a society find entertaining.It's unfortunate that even after being remade many viewers will not have the opportunity to see this. Then again, a film like this never does very well at the box office, so maybe it's for the best that it's being released on video for easy admission. Chances are there's enough people out there in the horror community who've been watching this just as closely as I have, and will pick it up instantly. Funny Games is a great psychological thriller, but it is also a fantastic artistic message given to us in the form of a horror film.

1158614,ALTNI5BAFUAQY,B00187FPC2,"Jery Tillotson ""cult author""","[8, 11]","SPOILER ALERTS!I had the craziest dream last night that some day a film maker would give us a home invasion movie where the victims act like real, desperate people instead of zombies who exist in an alternate universe.My dream first appeared after I watched the 2007 French film, ""Them,"" in which two healthy and robust victims run all around a farmhouse filled with saws and butcher knitves and chainsaws and never once pick up one of these items to protect themselves. When ""Them"" was remade in 2008 as ""The Strangers,"" the two healthy, robust victims were even more idiotic and cowered in their home as three pudgy strangers terrorized and finally killed them.And now, in Funny Games, we find three healthy and robust victims--a wife, her husband and teenage son--terrorzed and tortured by two teenage boys who like to wear white glves. And, oh, yeah, they have one of the most lethal weapons ever seen inhome invasion movie history: a golf club.For reasons unknown to the viewer, this one golf club so terrifies the victims that all they can do is weep, cower and glower at the baby-faced killers. When a boat full of neighbors dock at the pier of hell house, the wife (Naomi Watts) greets them along with one of her tormentors. Although he hss no weapon and looks like someone Naomi Watts could easily kick arse, she greets her friends and never once tries to scream for help. That one boat load of neighbors could have easly overpowered our smirking, young monster--but then there would have been no movie.After the wife is forced to strip to her underwear and is securely bound, the son is mmurdered.  Throughut all this, the husband appears to have been so seriously injured by the blow of a golf club, that he can only weep and moan. The two killers then leave the couple alone--and what do our tortured oouple do? The wife drags her wounded husband to the kitchen and for the next hour, they use a hair dryer to dry up the moisture from their cell phone that fell into the water.  No, neither of them barricades themselves with make-shift weapons--or try to find a good hiding place.The movie continues to unspool with one idiotic action after another--and you wonder why the escaped wife doesn't try to use her car or at least pick up a butcher knife--or why does her husband just sit in his chair in the kitchen, knowing the killers are going to return, and he does nothing.Maybe this was director's Michael Haneke's goal, since this is a shot-by-shot remake of his original movie.For some reason, the two teenage psychos, armed with a golf club, didn't terrify me half as much as the actions of a house of morons.",1,I Had the Craziest Dream,1275609600,"06 4, 2010",2010,2626,"['SPOILER', 'ALERTS', 'had', 'craziest', 'dream', 'last', 'night', 'day', 'film', 'maker', 'would', 'give', 'home', 'invasion', 'movie', 'where', 'victims', 'act', 'real', 'desperate', 'people', 'instead', 'zombies', 'who', 'exist', 'alternate', 'universe.My', 'dream', 'first', 'appeared', 'watched', '2007', 'French', 'film', 'Them', 'two', 'healthy', 'robust', 'victims', 'run', 'farmhouse', 'filled', 'saws', 'butcher', 'knitves', 'chainsaws', 'never', 'once', 'pick', 'up', 'one', 'items', 'protect', 'When', 'Them', 'was', 'remade', '2008', 'Strangers', 'two', 'healthy', 'robust', 'victims', 'were', 'even', 'more', 'idiotic', 'cowered', 'home', 'three', 'pudgy', 'strangers', 'terrorized', 'finally', 'killed', 'them.And', 'now', 'Funny', 'Games', 'find', 'three', 'healthy', 'robust', 'victims', 'wife', 'husband', 'teenage', 'son', 'terrorzed', 'tortured', 'two', 'teenage', 'boys', 'who', 'like', 'wear', 'white', 'glves', 'oh', 'yeah', 'have', 'one', 'most', 'lethal', 'weapons', 'ever', 'seen', 'inhome', 'invasion', 'movie', 'history', 'golf', 'club.For', 'reasons', 'unknown', 'viewer', 'one', 'golf', 'club', 'victims', 'can', 'do', 'weep', 'cower', 'glower', 'baby-faced', 'killers', 'When', 'boat', 'full', 'neighbors', 'dock', 'pier', 'hell', 'house', 'wife', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'along', 'one', 'tormentors', 'weapon', 'someone', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'could', 'easily', 'kick', 'arse', 'friends', 'never', 'once', 'tries', 'scream', 'help', 'one', 'boat', 'load', 'neighbors', 'could', 'have', 'easly', 'overpowered', 'smirking', 'young', 'monster', 'then', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'movie.After', 'wife', 'forced', 'strip', 'underwear', 'securely', 'bound', 'son', 'mmurdered', 'Throughut', 'husband', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'seriously', 'injured', 'blow', 'golf', 'club', 'can', 'only', 'weep', 'moan', 'two', 'killers', 'then', 'leave', 'couple', 'alone', 'what', 'do', 'tortured', 'oouple', 'do', 'wife', 'wounded', 'husband', 'kitchen', 'next', 'hour', 'use', 'hair', 'dryer', 'dry', 'up', 'moisture', 'cell', 'phone', 'fell', 'water', 'No', 'make-shift', 'weapons', 'try', 'find', 'good', 'hiding', 'place.The', 'movie', 'unspool', 'one', 'idiotic', 'action', 'wonder', 'why', 'escaped', 'wife', ""n't"", 'try', 'use', 'car', 'least', 'pick', 'up', 'butcher', 'knife', 'why', 'husband', 'just', 'sit', 'chair', 'kitchen', 'knowing', 'killers', 'are', 'going', 'return', 'nothing.Maybe', 'was', 'director', 'Michael', 'Haneke', 'goal', 'shot-by-shot', 'remake', 'original', 'movie.For', 'reason', 'two', 'teenage', 'psychos', 'armed', 'golf', 'club', 'did', ""n't"", 'terrify', 'half', 'as', 'much', 'actions', 'house', 'morons']",N/A
1158615,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,B00187FPC2,J from NY,"[5, 8]","""Funny Games"" is, bar none, one of the most repulsive, stomach churning, and hopeless films I have ever seen.  The story isn't unconventional, nothing that happens in the movie is new to any fan of thriller/demented psychodrama fans, and director Michael Haneke's attempt to make it some sort of intellectual exercise fails from beginnning to end.Michael Pitt is Peter, a too creepy to be real character straight out of any film about Leopold and Loeb, and Paul (Brady Corbett) is his companion in the torture and murder of an upper middle class family.  The wife, Ann, is played by Naomi Watts, and the husband, George, is played by Tim Roth.  (The director plays to the politically correct crowd by emasculating his character).  Neither of them are that exceptional and function more or less as none too bright cattle led to the slaughter.  Their son Georgie, played by Deavon Gearheart, had no place being in this movie.  One could say the same thing about Linda Blair being in ""The Exorcist"", but that was actually art and served a purpose.Pitt and Paul refer to each other as ""Beavis"", ""Tom and Jerry"", and an assortment of other references to the mass media. They are uber hip polite to Ann and George even as they terrorize and destroy their lives.  Wow, could it be a comment on the middle class, a kind of parody?  How original. I seem to remember a guy named Luis Bunuel making movies too, and he did similar things, but there was substance there.Since neither of them have any personality aside from being empty psychopaths, this does not make the viewer wonder, even for one moment, why they are the way they are or why they are doing what they are doing.Haneke didn't even blink when he decided to have Pitt turn to the camera and say, ""You're probably on their side, aren't you?""  Yeah.  So?  Is that supposed to mean we're not postmodern enough?  Is this his excuse for an hour of unrelenting pain and the destruction of innocence? Oh, and also, when Ann shoots Paul (the only satisfying moment in the movie), Peter says ""wait,"" rewind, and the film rewinds, resurrecting Paul.  It's not puzzling or interesting. It's cinematic emotional manipulation.  At least ""The Strangers"" was actually scary and had some mystery to it.Like Rob Zombie's ""The Devil's Rejects"", this is dirt confused with celluloid.",1,A gratuitous study in deepest evil,1252022400,"09 4, 2009",2009,2317,"['Funny', 'Games', 'bar', 'none', 'one', 'most', 'repulsive', 'stomach', 'churning', 'hopeless', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'story', ""n't"", 'unconventional', 'nothing', 'movie', 'new', 'fan', 'thriller/demented', 'psychodrama', 'fans', 'director', 'Michael', 'Haneke', 'attempt', 'make', 'sort', 'intellectual', 'exercise', 'beginnning', 'end.Michael', 'Pitt', 'Peter', 'too', 'creepy', 'be', 'real', 'character', 'straight', 'film', 'Leopold', 'Loeb', 'Paul', 'Brady', 'Corbett', 'companion', 'torture', 'murder', 'upper', 'middle', 'class', 'family', 'wife', 'Ann', 'played', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'husband', 'George', 'played', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'director', 'politically', 'correct', 'crowd', 'emasculating', 'character', 'are', 'exceptional', 'function', 'more', 'none', 'too', 'bright', 'cattle', 'led', 'slaughter', 'son', 'Georgie', 'played', 'Deavon', 'Gearheart', 'had', 'place', 'being', 'movie', 'One', 'could', 'say', 'same', 'thing', 'Linda', 'Blair', 'being', 'Exorcist', 'was', 'actually', 'art', 'served', 'purpose.Pitt', 'Paul', 'refer', 'other', 'Beavis', 'Tom', 'Jerry', 'assortment', 'other', 'references', 'mass', 'media', 'are', 'uber', 'hip', 'polite', 'Ann', 'George', 'even', 'terrorize', 'destroy', 'lives', 'Wow', 'could', 'be', 'comment', 'middle', 'class', 'kind', 'parody', 'How', 'original', 'seem', 'remember', 'guy', 'named', 'Luis', 'Bunuel', 'making', 'movies', 'too', 'did', 'similar', 'things', 'there', 'was', 'substance', 'there.Since', 'have', 'personality', 'aside', 'being', 'empty', 'psychopaths', 'not', 'make', 'viewer', 'wonder', 'even', 'one', 'moment', 'why', 'are', 'way', 'are', 'why', 'are', 'doing', 'what', 'are', 'doing.Haneke', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'blink', 'when', 'decided', 'have', 'Pitt', 'turn', 'camera', 'say', ""'re"", 'probably', 'side', 'are', ""n't"", 'Yeah', 'So', 'supposed', 'mean', ""'re"", 'not', 'postmodern', 'enough', 'excuse', 'hour', 'unrelenting', 'pain', 'destruction', 'innocence', 'Oh', 'also', 'when', 'Ann', 'Paul', 'only', 'satisfying', 'moment', 'movie', 'Peter', 'wait', 'rewind', 'film', 'rewinds', 'resurrecting', 'Paul', 'not', 'puzzling', 'interesting', 'cinematic', 'emotional', 'manipulation', 'least', 'Strangers', 'was', 'actually', 'scary', 'had', 'mystery', 'it.Like', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'Devil', 'Rejects', 'dirt', 'confused', 'celluloid']",N/A

Two normal-seeming young men, Paul and Peter, patrician-looking, harmless-appearing, show up at the door of the couple's vacation house in an upper middle class neighborhood. One comes in asking to borrow four eggs. On his way out he drops them and breaks them.  Then he asks for four more.

The two unlikely young men are psychopathic, two rotten, evil guys who are ruthless. They seriously cripple the husband and hold the family captive while they start playing their nasty and deadly games.The movie is, in a sense, pointless because it's going to take your over a cliff and probably make you very uncomfortable.

Never has this phrase been more appropriate than with Michael Haneke's ""Funny Games,"" an Americanized remake of his 1997 film of the same name. Unlike the majority of people who will see this movie, I have not (yet) seen the original and knew little about either version before watching this. I didn't know what to expect when the movie began and, now that it's ended, I don't know what to think.The basic summary one can give for this film feels simple enough; a nice suburban family consisting of George (Tim Roth), Ann (Naomi Watts), and their young son Georgie are vacationing at their semi-secluded lake house. Minutes after arriving, two young men appear at their house. Soon, they are being held hostage by the two men and are forced to play a series of little games all revolving around a little bet. The two men bet that the family will be dead by 9 a.m. the next morning and the family bets they'll be alive.Well...something like that. The set-up appears to be just your average set-up for a hostage/slasher movie. But that's not what this film is at all. If you're looking for a horror film or a psychological thriller, start looking elsewhere. ""Funny Games"" is an indictment of moviegoers who are so accustomed to seeing on-screen violence we're desensitized to everything.Here is a film where we have two, clean-cut, innocent looking men who just happen to be killers. They have no motive or explanation for what they're doing. We have a typical suburban family who have no idea what's going on and react appropriately and realistically to the situations they're thrown into.The film absolutely defies convention in every aspect. Not a single thing that occurs in this film is predictable, there's not a single cheap thrill here, and it's really just a brilliant piece of filmmaking. For a critique on the apathetic quality moviegoers have to violence against innocent people, it's brilliant how Haneke allows a film that could have been very violent and gory to have little on-screen violence. To further the indictment of the audience, Michael Pitt's character will talk directly to the camera, making the audience a part of what is going on.In the hands of a different writer/director this could've become an annoying plot device. Enough about that though, let's discuss one of the most pivotal aspects of the film; the acting.Watts and Roth are so believable, you do empathize with their characters....These are the kinds of performances where they completely embody who they're playing rather than just playing a character. Pitt and Brady Corbet as the psychotic duo are quietly blood-chilling and wholly believable.I'm guessing Haneke's goal with his Americanized version is just to present the film to a broader audience but whatever the goal...""Funny Games"" is a film that deserves to be viewed, thought about, and discussed. It's not very entertaining, nor is it meant to be, and it's not very satisfying either (once again though, it wasn't meant to be). It's definitely a thinking person's movie, but it's an important film.

Living with that, I get sleepless sometimes, have to get up and read, and need the TV on for, well, you all know what the TV is for in the middle of a sleepless night.I have Showtime, HBO, and TMC provided free with the rental cottage I live in year-around, along with a lot of other channels. Despite that, there is often nothing on TV late at night. So I landed the other night around three a.m. on ""Funny Games."" A family was being terrorized by two wormy males acting like teenage preps but looking more like aging twenty-somethings who've become type-cast as glistening pink ropes of exposed animal intestine (Michael Pitt...your career has veered permanently off of any other kind of track). Still, the important characters (the family) were convincing. So convincing that I stuck my thumnail between my teeth and could not even blink, let alone go to bed or change the channel. Then, of course, the movie ended the way we all know it ends.I'm as permanently sickened and depressed by what I saw as Michael Pitt is doomed to be cast as The Wormy Dude in any movie thereafter. But see, some ""director"" thought I needed A Lesson Regarding My Avid Hunger For On-Screen Ugliness, Atrocious Cruelty, and Violence For Its Own Sake. Personally, I have no such hunger, but this director did his work with a cannon, sloppily, the easy way, making sure he wouldn't miss. It was a lot like the way we refuse to do away with capital punishment even though sometimes the innocent are executed by mistake. Who cares, just so the guilty are fried, and society stands both protected and corrected? This movie's director would be able to explain that concept to anyone who asked, I'll bet. Maybe he'll make it the message of his next brilliant film.Shot from a cannon, this isn't art, not even bad art. It isn't even ""I Spit On Your Grave,"" although with a bit more class, it might have risen to that bottom rung of infamy.Anyway, Mister Director, thanks for the event. I suffered pointlessly, I did not ask for it, but in a world ablaze with wars and misery, I am surely better for it, right?

We witness a family, including their child, being tormented, humiliated, tortured and murdered by two psycopaths. It is truly shocking and offensive, so yes, job done. The target audience may be the people who 'enjoy' the 'Hostel' and 'Saw' franchises, but are they going to (a) see the irony, or (b) care about it if they do?  Haneke subverts conventional narrative and plot, puts our demons up on the screen, has them run riot and emerge triumphant. This is a technically accomplished exercise in egregious sadistic nihilism masquerading as an indictment of other, less cold blooded, examples of the genre. No story is played out. There is no hope, no help, no catharsis, no justice and no judgements are made. The viewers deep need to protect and avenge the family is provoked, toyed with (one of the 'Funny Games') and denied. This is one of the occasional horror stories that emerge from the real world presented without narrative or plot. In what sense does this confront cinematic violence, except perhaps to remind us that justice is seldom done in this world?The conceit behind the film is therefore obvious, have the audience identify with the family and abhor their merciless tormentors, yet have the family progressively lose all hope and the perpetrators walk away free to do it all again. Its not even a clever conceit. The onscreen violence is minimal, but its basically psychological warfare against anyone with a decent mindset who is unfortunate enough to view it. Against this background it makes no valid points about onscreen violence because it doesnt really address the subject. The target seems to be the moral hypocrisy of a society that consumes 'torture porn' but Haneke and his clever fanbase are missing the point. There is nothing inherently wrong in presenting nightmares in entertainment. That is as old as the human race and started when we were in tribes listening to storytellers around campfires. Portraying our demons in fiction for our heroes to destroy is a classic way of exorcising them. We know real life can be appallingly cruel, that why art developed to enhance the good and mitigate the bad. Does that seem reasonable, Michael?Another reviewer posted a positive review with the argument 'we're talking about it, so mission accomplished'. The same could of course be said about 911 or the Beslan massacre. I dont know how many casual readers there will be of this piece, and I know if there are, this will only add to the curiosity, but I would seriously urge anyone to avoid this. It is almost diabolically wicked and I felt like I needed a bath after watching it. Tim Roth apparently turned it down at first, pondered the kind of film he was in during shooting and has apparently refused to watch it since completion. I only wish I'd followed his advice. The only small mercy is that Haneke has found film as an outlet.

1158631,A2MF2QVSCUI27G,B00187FPC2,"Luan Gaines ""luansos""","[3, 5]","Granted that this film is an almost word-for-word remake of a 1997 German film, a supposed satire on the violence of the media; acknowledging this point, Funny Games fails on almost every level. Poor production values, nearly illegible credits and a sloppy plot cannot be saved by reputable actors, especially Tim Roth and Naomi Watts, who play George and Ann, a couple visiting their summer home when they are assaulted by two intruders, Paul (Michael Pitt) and Peter (Brady Corbett). Both young men are arguably prep-school graduates with smarmy manners, both sport white gloves and a sneering insouciance as they wreak havoc on the lives of this couple and their son. It is immediately clear that there is something sinister about the young men's arrival at the house, Ann picking up on it first, asking Paul and Peter to leave, a request they reward with an attack on her husband with a golf club (the family dog the first victim of their random outbursts).The film soon slips into a series of brutal acts, Pitt occasionally breaking sequence to ask a question of the viewer, an implied participation in the unfolding events. What is most disturbing about this film is the sadism that dominates the screen from beginning to end, the helplessness of the victims and the absence of any action other than an acceptance of one's fate. History is filled with the courageous actions of people in extreme circumstances, but these characters are stupefied by the violence of their jailers, George an ineffective man felled by his pain and helplessness to save his family from harm. Watts, the producer, bears more weight in this endeavor, a character that moves like a wind-up toy going in circles, defeated by a lack of imagination or survival instinct. The lobotomized-by -fear family is easy prey to young men who sadistically destroy their illusions. But even the young men are facile, one-dimensional creatures, their brutality casual and uninspired.Viewing this film without background information, I would be appalled by its systematic brutality. Whatever point is to be made, there is no redeeming value in watching two hours of this display. I must question my own motives- no doubt the film's intention- but also feel manipulated and patronized by a plot that offers little in return. There is a senseless scene where Paul uses the TV remote control to rewind the recent actions, a break that might have offered hope to the cringing family. But that action is simply erased with no explanation. It is this snide complicity that ultimately offends me the most, sheer bad taste in the guise of satire. Tim Roth deserves better and Naomi Watts should know better. Sadism without context is valuable only to the most cynical fan of this genre.

The reason for this is that despite a glorious first-thirty minutes and a superb performance by all leads involved (especially Naomi Watts, whose perfection of the American Accent is an art-form in itself), the director either wanted to get a little creative in the second half and goes and ruins it.You obviously know the story - two men intrude a household and go about butchering the inhabitants in new and inventive ways. The straight-forward storyline is much appreciated, but its when the second half rolls in that things get really badly executed. Here are the prime offenders:1. The `Fourth Wall' : Every so often, the killer looks directly into the camera and addresses the audience, asking us if we want a full length feature film, etc. This was not witty at all and reduced the entire film to satire. Seriously, it was hard to take this seriously post this event, and definitely made the film less horrific2. The `Rewind' : At one point in the movie, when the suspense isn't going the killers way, he simply `rewinds' that 2-minute stretch, and does it again the way it should be. This is pictured literally the way it sounds - and its not a good thing. In fact, once this happened I couldn't wait for the film to get over as it all felt very, very staged and totally disengaged the audience.3. The Killing of the little boy : He is the first casualty and obviously this was very sad, but the entire segment was handled very poorly. Also, the reactions of the parents right after the killing seemed very strange and unrealistic. They were busy planning their own escape and sat around coming up with exit strategies and didn't even once bother to look at the dead body of their son! Really, it seems that the parents couldn't have cared less that their child was killed five minutes ago.Despite these obvious mistakes, the film is riveting as it offers murder and gruesome homicide as art, and its ironic that we as audiences will actually pay to watch it. Of course, we are a sick, twisted and deranged society, but the film only kicks that up a notch to make us realize we are even sicker than we thought we were. If this realization is something you strive for, then by all means rent this or buy this and watch it with friends (but never alone - it could drive you insane or paranoid). If you wish for a simpler world, I suggest a kinder film about homicide - ""Bambi"".Two Stars.",2,"Frightening & Hilarious : The Bizarre, Misguided World of ""Funny Games""",1210550400,"05 12, 2008",2008,2550,"['Obviously', 'very', 'disturbing', 'film', 'means', 'horror', 'classic', 'vein', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'even', 'mediocre', 'Hannibal', 'reason', 'glorious', 'first-thirty', 'minutes', 'superb', 'performance', 'leads', 'involved', 'especially', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'perfection', 'American', 'Accent', 'art-form', 'director', 'either', 'wanted', 'get', 'little', 'creative', 'second', 'half', 'it.You', 'obviously', 'know', 'story', 'two', 'men', 'intrude', 'household', 'go', 'butchering', 'inhabitants', 'new', 'inventive', 'ways', 'straight-forward', 'storyline', 'much', 'appreciated', 'when', 'second', 'half', 'rolls', 'things', 'get', 'really', 'badly', 'executed', 'Here', 'are', 'prime', 'offenders:1', 'Fourth', 'Wall', 'so', 'often', 'killer', 'directly', 'camera', 'audience', 'asking', 'want', 'full', 'length', 'feature', 'film', 'etc', 'was', 'not', 'witty', 'reduced', 'entire', 'film', 'satire', 'Seriously', 'was', 'hard', 'take', 'seriously', 'post', 'event', 'definitely', 'made', 'film', 'less', 'horrific2', 'Rewind', 'one', 'point', 'movie', 'when', 'suspense', ""n't"", 'going', 'killers', 'way', 'simply', 'rewinds', '2-minute', 'stretch', 'again', 'way', 'should', 'be', 'pictured', 'literally', 'way', 'not', 'good', 'thing', 'fact', 'once', 'happened', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'film', 'get', 'over', 'felt', 'very', 'very', 'staged', 'totally', 'disengaged', 'audience.3', 'Killing', 'little', 'boy', 'first', 'casualty', 'obviously', 'was', 'very', 'sad', 'entire', 'segment', 'was', 'handled', 'very', 'poorly', 'Also', 'reactions', 'parents', 'right', 'killing', 'seemed', 'very', 'strange', 'unrealistic', 'were', 'busy', 'planning', 'own', 'escape', 'sat', 'coming', 'up', 'exit', 'strategies', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'once', 'bother', 'look', 'dead', 'body', 'son', 'Really', 'parents', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'cared', 'less', 'child', 'was', 'killed', 'five', 'minutes', 'obvious', 'mistakes', 'film', 'riveting', 'murder', 'gruesome', 'homicide', 'art', 'ironic', 'audiences', 'will', 'actually', 'pay', 'watch', 'course', 'are', 'sick', 'twisted', 'deranged', 'society', 'film', 'only', 'up', 'notch', 'make', 'realize', 'are', 'even', 'sicker', 'thought', 'were', 'realization', 'something', 'strive', 'then', 'means', 'rent', 'buy', 'watch', 'friends', 'never', 'alone', 'could', 'drive', 'insane', 'paranoid', 'wish', 'simpler', 'world', 'suggest', 'kinder', 'film', 'homicide', 'Bambi', '.Two', 'Stars']",N/A

1158636,AN8M401S8Y6DA,B00187FPC2,Mike Liddell,"[6, 9]","I read about director Michael Haneke's originalFunny Gamesseveral years ago in the bookFangoria's 101 Best Horror Movies You've Never Seen: A Celebration of the World's Most Unheralded Fright Flicks.  When I reviewed it I felt it struck terror in viewers in a way that the Saws, Hostels, Prequels, and Sequels all fell short of in comparison.Haneke is trying to do more than just entertain here.  When you see these two young guys torturing these people some viewers tend to get enraged to the point where, in their mind, they'd love to be in a room with those two alone.  I could see viewers coming up with ideas of what they'd do to them and getting revenge could almost sound pleasing.  Does that mean were just as bad as them?  If you didn't get that the references to the camera from the actors will help you feel involved.  Maybe he's saying, is it the loud music responsible or violence in the media but as the guys point out there basically just bored.  Here is the whole theory of we like to label our fears because then it becomes less scary.  And you could go on analyzing the film and putting different meanings on it cause it has many levels.This remake of Funny Games is nearly frame for frame the exact film as the 1997 original.  A family is being terrorized both physically and physiologically by two young males at their vacation home.  Haneke's solid directing and patience with the camera are what make Funny Games so effective.  So why is the original better?1.  I felt the remake did too many winks at the camera.  I felt this made the film slightly less effective.  As in ok we get your point already.  Or the whole guilt angle he's trying to make you feel is taken away, kind of like if you did something wrong but the person you made the mistake to just wont let up and you get annoyed instead of guilty.  In the original I felt the references to the viewers were more subtle.  This is the biggest reason the original is more effective.2.  The film is most effective on the first watching.  If you have to pick one to watch first I'd go with the original or perhaps I feel this is is because I saw the original first.3.  It's kind of a minor thing but if you collect dvds and care the cover art for the original is just cooler.  From a distance I thought this dvd was Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer.To recap Funny games is a horror film with many levels done by a talented director but I would go with his original version for an initial viewing.",4,[3.5] Why the original is a better film.,1214352000,"06 25, 2008",2008,2481,"['read', 'director', 'Michael', 'Haneke', 'originalFunny', 'Gamesseveral', 'years', 'ago', 'bookFangoria', '101', 'Best', 'Horror', 'Movies', ""'ve"", 'Never', 'Seen', 'Celebration', 'World', 'Most', 'Unheralded', 'Fright', 'Flicks', 'When', 'reviewed', 'felt', 'struck', 'terror', 'viewers', 'way', 'Saws', 'Hostels', 'Prequels', 'Sequels', 'fell', 'short', 'comparison.Haneke', 'trying', 'do', 'more', 'just', 'entertain', 'here', 'When', 'see', 'two', 'young', 'guys', 'torturing', 'people', 'viewers', 'tend', 'get', 'enraged', 'point', 'where', 'mind', ""'d"", 'love', 'be', 'room', 'two', 'alone', 'could', 'see', 'viewers', 'coming', 'up', 'ideas', 'what', ""'d"", 'do', 'getting', 'revenge', 'could', 'almost', 'sound', 'pleasing', 'mean', 'were', 'just', 'as', 'bad', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'references', 'camera', 'actors', 'will', 'help', 'feel', 'involved', 'Maybe', 'saying', 'loud', 'music', 'responsible', 'violence', 'media', 'guys', 'point', 'out', 'there', 'basically', 'just', 'bored', 'Here', 'whole', 'theory', 'like', 'label', 'fears', 'then', 'less', 'scary', 'could', 'go', 'analyzing', 'film', 'putting', 'different', 'meanings', 'cause', 'many', 'levels.This', 'remake', 'Funny', 'Games', 'nearly', 'frame', 'frame', 'exact', 'film', '1997', 'original', 'family', 'being', 'terrorized', 'physically', 'physiologically', 'two', 'young', 'males', 'vacation', 'home', 'Haneke', 'solid', 'directing', 'patience', 'camera', 'are', 'what', 'make', 'Funny', 'Games', 'so', 'effective', 'So', 'why', 'original', 'better', '1', 'felt', 'remake', 'did', 'too', 'many', 'winks', 'camera', 'felt', 'made', 'film', 'slightly', 'less', 'effective', 'ok', 'get', 'point', 'already', 'whole', 'guilt', 'trying', 'make', 'feel', 'taken', 'away', 'kind', 'did', 'something', 'wrong', 'person', 'made', 'mistake', 'just', 'wont', 'let', 'up', 'get', 'annoyed', 'instead', 'guilty', 'original', 'felt', 'references', 'viewers', 'were', 'more', 'subtle', 'biggest', 'reason', 'original', 'more', 'effective.2', 'film', 'most', 'effective', 'first', 'watching', 'have', 'pick', 'one', 'watch', 'first', ""'d"", 'go', 'original', 'perhaps', 'feel', 'saw', 'original', 'first.3', 'kind', 'minor', 'thing', 'collect', 'dvds', 'care', 'cover', 'art', 'original', 'just', 'cooler', 'distance', 'thought', 'dvd', 'was', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'Rise', 'Silver', 'Surfer.To', 'recap', 'Funny', 'games', 'horror', 'film', 'many', 'levels', 'done', 'talented', 'director', 'would', 'go', 'original', 'version', 'initial', 'viewing']",N/A

If that's part of the satire, it's ham fisted and clunky. It only gets worse as the evil golfers break reality by talking to the audience...yes, talking down in fact, for watching the movie. Then there's the ultimate ridiculous remote control scene...where after one evil golfer is killed, the other grabs the TV remote and backs up the movie, then changes events so they can keep torturing the family.

1158644,AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B00187FPC2,"N. Durham ""Big Evil""","[0, 0]","Austrian filmmaker Michael Haneke remade his late 90's film Funny Games with this nearly shot-by-shot 2008 remake, starring Naomi Watts and Tim Roth as a vacationing husband and wife who, along with their young son (Devon Gearhart) are terrorized by two sadistic young men (Michael Pitt and Brady Corbet) who have their own plans on how to have fun with the family.  Let it be known right now that there is nothing funny about Funny Games, as the film becomes a voyeuristic study of violence and the impact that it has on the viewer, even though a majority of the violence occurs off-screen, sometimes just barely.  Haneke even goes so far as to break the fourth-wall in an effort to further get his point across, which isn't always necessary.  The cast is brilliant, and Pitt and Corbet are more than suitably frightening in their roles.  Make no mistake that Funny Games isn't something that's easy to watch due to it's tone and the fact that Haneke draws out the film for longer than necessary, and viewing more than once may qualify as being masochistic behavior.  Still though, Funny Games is worth seeing just for the fact that there isn't much else quite like it, just make sure you don't go diving in head first.",4,"Subtle, brutal, and devestating",1223078400,"10 4, 2008",2008,1220,"['Austrian', 'filmmaker', 'Michael', 'Haneke', 'remade', 'late', '90', 'film', 'Funny', 'Games', 'nearly', 'shot-by-shot', '2008', 'remake', 'starring', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'vacationing', 'husband', 'wife', 'who', 'young', 'son', 'Devon', 'Gearhart', 'are', 'terrorized', 'two', 'sadistic', 'young', 'men', 'Michael', 'Pitt', 'Brady', 'Corbet', 'who', 'have', 'own', 'plans', 'how', 'have', 'fun', 'family', 'Let', 'be', 'known', 'right', 'now', 'nothing', 'funny', 'Funny', 'Games', 'film', 'voyeuristic', 'study', 'violence', 'impact', 'viewer', 'even', 'majority', 'violence', 'off-screen', 'sometimes', 'just', 'barely', 'Haneke', 'even', 'so', 'far', 'break', 'fourth-wall', 'effort', 'further', 'get', 'point', ""n't"", 'always', 'necessary', 'cast', 'brilliant', 'Pitt', 'Corbet', 'are', 'more', 'suitably', 'frightening', 'roles', 'Make', 'mistake', 'Funny', 'Games', ""n't"", 'something', 'easy', 'watch', 'due', 'tone', 'fact', 'Haneke', 'out', 'film', 'longer', 'necessary', 'viewing', 'more', 'once', 'may', 'qualify', 'being', 'masochistic', 'behavior', 'Still', 'Funny', 'Games', 'worth', 'seeing', 'just', 'fact', ""n't"", 'much', 'else', 'quite', 'just', 'make', 'sure', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'diving', 'head', 'first']",N/A

Anytime there's an average or mediocre movie, whenever there's even the SLIGHTEST attempt at some underlying higher meaning to the movie, or some kind of social commentary, or something as blatant as the director saying ""well here's where I was going with this,"" the movie AUTOMATICALLY gets about half a point to a full point higher in average rating than it probably deserves. It's like people realize, ""oh crap, so that's what he was trying to say in this movie? I totally missed that, let me give this a higher rating so people don't think I'm dense for missing the point.""What a great equalizer. Whenever that ""point"" exists in your piece of crap movie, it gets elevated to this pristine level of existence where you can't *dare criticize the movie, otherwise you totally missed the director's point.Mulholland DriveandBabelimmediately come to mind as one of those pointless films that's gotten exalted to a higher status because of the ""point"" those movies were making.Tearing down portion of the review:--I don't care what his previous work was, Tim Roth (the father) was a JOKE in this movie. I'm not even talking about his character decisions yet (i.e. criticizing things his character in the movie did), I'm talking about the actor himself. What's with the teary eyes the entire time? If he didn't look like he was about to cry he looked like he was falling asleep at other times. There's other miscellaneous scenes in which his body language, tone of voice, facial muscle contortions were so off that I was laughing at his character's plight.--The father in this movie has got to be the most pathetic male in the history of mankind. In the beginning when he initially gets punked out and whacked with a golf club, did you see how he tried to protect his son? First of all, ideally, you'd actually be fighting back from the ground, but worst case, you'd try to jerk your son away from the attackers, and then/or shield him with your body. Instead he casually held his arm out in the same carefree way you would casually open your umbrella upon first hint of a few raindrops. I was wondering when he planned on grabbing the leg of the attacker and trying to bring him down to the ground.--Exactly WTF kind of injury did he sustain anyway?? What kind of pain does a grown man sustain from a golf club that keeps him silently weeping and giving up while your wife and son are in danger right there with you? You'd think he was whacked on his head the way he was mentally debilitated the whole time.--That kid was the worst hide and go seek player in history.--When she was about to make a call on the newly obtained cell phone near the end, why did Naomi Watts have to ask WHO to call, as her pathetic husband gruffly tells her to call the police.--There should've been many more moments with a lot more screaming from the parents, in which the captors would tell them to be quiet. Instead they are just like phantoms just going along with the ride, periodically throwing in generic comments like ""why are you doing this?"" or ""take what you need and leave.""--What type of person, let alone an entire family, gets held hostage by a nine iron? There were way too many occasions where Naomi Watts had a great opportunity to attempt something.--When the son is killed, the parents show no grief. There's no NOISE at all. Later when Naomi Watts was consoling the grieving husband as he moaned like a fool, I assumed that his mouth was gagged or duct taped. Nope. That was just that stupid character (or actor's) ""method."" He was really getting the grief across there with that moaning.--I liked the main villain in this movie. Good acting.

1158646,ATYAX6GYKXDLZ,B00187FPC2,"Neil and Tracy ""www.bookroomreviews.com & www...","[0, 2]","The biggest debate surrounding the release of Funny Games in the US is whether someone should bother to watch if they have seen the original German version.  Funny GamesOriginally released in 1997, the Michael Haneke German version became popular in the US following the announcement of the US remake.  Many avid movie watchers were curious and wanted to see what the original was about.  Many movie fans have been disappointed to discover that the US movie release is essentially scene-by-scene, step-by-step, and line-by-line the same.  The only difference is the US version has a slightly more updated feel, and of course, it uses some well-known American actors.It is hard to write a review of Funny Games (USA) without reflecting a bit on how it compares to the original.  The plot of the story is so unique and the subtle way in which the horror develops in the movie is what makes it innovative.  There is nothing overly awe-inspiring about the action or the lines in the script, but the way the movie plays out is intriguing to viewers in an almost guilty way.Let's start with a review of the US DVD release and then compare it a bit with the earlier version.  This story begins in a very off-beat way.  A family of three, George (Tim Roth), Ann (Naomi Watts), and little Georgie (Devon Gearhart), are one their way to spend a couple weeks at their vacation home.  Upon arriving, George and Georgie head to get the boat read for a sail, while Ann prepares dinner.  Soon, Ann and George are surprised when a strange guest appears at the door seeking to borrow eggs for the neighbors.  This seems innocent enough.  However, several awkward moments and interactions later, two deranged young men are engaged in an argument with Ann.George and Georgie reenter the house and following a few more awkward moments, Peter (Brady Corbet) hits George in the leg with a golf club, wounding him.  Ann returns and is shocked to see what has developed.  From here, the story gets crazy, as Peter and his more dominant partner, Paul (Michael Pitt), begin to physically and emotionally torture the family for several hours.  They invite them to play several sick and twisted games and make a bet that they will all be dead by nine o'clock the next morning.Again, there is nothing exceedingly unique about the dark and violent nature of this film.  Its strengths lie more in the twisted and demented minds of the killers, some subtle interludes of quirky movie humor (such as Paul periodically talking to the audience through the camera lens).  The story itself is fairly depressing.  There are a few scenes and plot elements that are not generally used in American movies that are likely carried over from the more loose entertainment and social culture in Europe.It is hard to give an entirely fair assessment of Funny Games, the US version, after having seen the German version previously.  The acting is decent.  Naomi Watts is good.  Tim Roth is okay in his less dominant role.  It is hard to get involved with the two as a couple, as it does not seem realistic.  Corbet and Pitt are solid in their roles as demented killers.  In some ways, however, we found the German version of Funny Games to be a bit more effective as the natural humor and unique components of the movie were more impacting as portrayed from a non-American perspective.  While we do find the story a bit grim and depressing, and advise people to be cautious with it, our strong grade is based on the innovative qualities of the film.[...]",4,Movie Room Reviews Funny Games starring Naomi Watts,1212019200,"05 29, 2008",2008,3506,"['biggest', 'debate', 'surrounding', 'release', 'Funny', 'Games', 'US', 'someone', 'should', 'bother', 'watch', 'have', 'seen', 'original', 'German', 'version', 'Funny', 'GamesOriginally', 'released', '1997', 'Michael', 'Haneke', 'German', 'version', 'became', 'popular', 'US', 'following', 'announcement', 'US', 'remake', 'Many', 'avid', 'movie', 'watchers', 'were', 'curious', 'wanted', 'see', 'what', 'original', 'was', 'about', 'Many', 'movie', 'fans', 'have', 'been', 'disappointed', 'discover', 'US', 'movie', 'release', 'essentially', 'scene-by-scene', 'step-by-step', 'line-by-line', 'same', 'only', 'difference', 'US', 'version', 'slightly', 'more', 'updated', 'feel', 'course', 'well-known', 'American', 'actors.It', 'hard', 'write', 'review', 'Funny', 'Games', 'USA', 'reflecting', 'bit', 'how', 'original', 'plot', 'story', 'so', 'unique', 'subtle', 'way', 'horror', 'movie', 'what', 'innovative', 'nothing', 'overly', 'awe-inspiring', 'action', 'lines', 'script', 'way', 'movie', 'out', 'intriguing', 'viewers', 'almost', 'guilty', 'way.Let', 'start', 'review', 'US', 'DVD', 'release', 'then', 'compare', 'bit', 'earlier', 'version', 'story', 'very', 'off-beat', 'way', 'family', 'three', 'George', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'Ann', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'little', 'Georgie', 'Devon', 'Gearhart', 'are', 'one', 'way', 'spend', 'couple', 'weeks', 'vacation', 'home', 'arriving', 'George', 'Georgie', 'head', 'get', 'boat', 'read', 'sail', 'Ann', 'dinner', 'Soon', 'Ann', 'George', 'are', 'surprised', 'when', 'strange', 'guest', 'door', 'seeking', 'borrow', 'eggs', 'neighbors', 'innocent', 'enough', 'However', 'several', 'awkward', 'moments', 'interactions', 'later', 'two', 'deranged', 'young', 'men', 'are', 'engaged', 'argument', 'Ann.George', 'Georgie', 'reenter', 'house', 'following', 'few', 'more', 'awkward', 'moments', 'Peter', 'Brady', 'Corbet', 'George', 'leg', 'golf', 'club', 'wounding', 'Ann', 'returns', 'shocked', 'see', 'what', 'developed', 'here', 'story', 'crazy', 'Peter', 'more', 'dominant', 'partner', 'Paul', 'Michael', 'Pitt', 'begin', 'physically', 'emotionally', 'torture', 'family', 'several', 'hours', 'invite', 'play', 'several', 'sick', 'twisted', 'games', 'make', 'bet', 'will', 'be', 'dead', 'nine', 'next', 'morning.Again', 'nothing', 'exceedingly', 'unique', 'dark', 'violent', 'nature', 'film', 'strengths', 'lie', 'more', 'twisted', 'demented', 'minds', 'killers', 'subtle', 'interludes', 'quirky', 'movie', 'humor', 'such', 'Paul', 'periodically', 'talking', 'audience', 'camera', 'story', 'fairly', 'depressing', 'are', 'few', 'scenes', 'plot', 'elements', 'are', 'not', 'generally', 'used', 'American', 'movies', 'are', 'likely', 'carried', 'more', 'loose', 'entertainment', 'social', 'culture', 'Europe.It', 'hard', 'give', 'entirely', 'fair', 'assessment', 'Funny', 'Games', 'US', 'version', 'having', 'seen', 'German', 'version', 'previously', 'acting', 'decent', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'good', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'okay', 'less', 'dominant', 'role', 'hard', 'get', 'involved', 'two', 'couple', 'not', 'seem', 'realistic', 'Corbet', 'Pitt', 'are', 'solid', 'roles', 'demented', 'killers', 'ways', 'however', 'found', 'German', 'version', 'Funny', 'Games', 'be', 'bit', 'more', 'effective', 'natural', 'humor', 'unique', 'components', 'movie', 'were', 'more', 'impacting', 'portrayed', 'non-American', 'perspective', 'do', 'find', 'story', 'bit', 'grim', 'depressing', 'advise', 'people', 'be', 'cautious', 'strong', 'grade', 'based', 'innovative', 'qualities', 'film.', '[', ']']",N/A

1158648,A1PL8JA0TEHBVN,B00187FPC2,Paulo Leite,"[3, 11]","I saw the original European version when it came up some 11 years ago. At that time, the film was just a mediocre exercise in screenplay manipulation who succeeded in getting some undeserved hype in intellectual cineaste circles due to some questionable narrative options. And at that time, I found it all so unoriginal.Eleven years later, for some reason, it seems someone found it was worth an American remake. Well... this new version with Naomi Watts and Tim Roth (who bring in some terrific performances as usual) is just a kind-of line by line remake. Meaning the film is as dumb now as it was 11 years ago.Dad, mom and their 12yo son take their boat to their lake house where they plan to spend a nice weekend sailing. But after arriving, they get the visit from two young men (apparently staying at the neighbor house) who end up being two sadistic, well mannered, soft voiced, always smiling killers. Sounds original?You know what comes next... and you know how it will end.In my point of view, the things that caused such a fuss about this film were:a)The annoying attitude of the killers all through the entire film. They are always smiling and being nice and polite. Well... there is nothing wrong with polite killers (Norman Bates was like that) except that these killers are just pretending (unlike Norman Bates who was really like that). Here, their politeness is a nice start of things... but after a while I'm thinking to myself ""won't they show any true character ever?"". No. It's all kept superficial.b)Adding to all that, comes a screenplay devoided of any originality. In fact, this is one of those films where the victims are as dumb about the things they do that it ends up being irritating. You will find yourself saying to yourself ""why don't they do this or that instead?""c)From time to time, the killers look at us viewers... or talk to us discussing the fictional world they are all in. They literally break the fiction. I find that so pretentious.And finally:d)The killers seem to be God. They know everything. They do everything... and they even have powers to (how can I explain this?) go back in time using the rewind button on a remote control. But the victims, unexplainable cannot do that.After that, the film is a huge ""anything goes"" played to the advantage of the killers. And that's it. I wonder why did they bothered to take so long hurting that family.The whole film is a bunch of pretentiousness and outdated horror clich&eacute;s... like when one killer says ""let's play a game..."" - Duh, how many times have I heard that phrase in a horror movie? Or when the killers say they will leave for good and let the victims live... but we know they'll be back. Or when the killers stylishly discuss the physics of the Universe - save me from that one, please... or when the camera follows one of the killers out of the room while the other is left with a shotgun and you know you are gonna hear a shot (and the director is hoping you are biting your nail asking who got killed). Duh!Big clich&eacute;s played again and again.This film comes some 60 years after Hitchcock'sRopeand it is sad how heavy handed it looks and how little it adds.

Layman Jr.,"[1, 2]","This tops my list of movies I never want to see again, where it is in bad company with Natural Born Killers, Open Water, Prey (2007), and Frozen.  These are stories where we get to wallow in terror and hopelessness, without the solace of believing the victims are at least trading their lives for something noble.  I never saw Saw, but I'm sure it'd make the list, too.  (Did one reviewer say the Saw franchise is the highest grossing ever?  Not true!  According to a website I found, it's number 50, trailing Harry Potter and 48 others, at only $877 million.  My faith in humankind is restored.  Not.)There IS one area where this effort excels:  It keeps us balanced on a white-knuckle knife-edge of hope that someone in the family will survive.  It seems so easy -- just get out of the house, run, flee, hide in the neighbor's woodshed, climb a tree, flag down a passing car, hide in the lake breathing through a hollow reed, anything!  The kidnapper/killers aren't especially big, strong, well-armed, or even very focused.  There are a couple of escapes, but only temporarily.

Warning, this is not a ""feel good"" movie. So if that's what you're looking for, you're not going to like this movie at all.The story follows a middle aged couple who drive out to their vacation home, and soon find themselves being visited to two young college age men, apparent friends of their neighbors (and relatives).  The two men, aren't what they seem though.First, I really liked how different a story it was.  And I liked that the drama and tension had nothing to do with anything being blown up, or some big name star.  It's a complicated story, put into a sort of simple theme. Great casting, strong characters, some very eerie dialogue & intense scenes that didn't revolve around showing us everything, and a scenario that definitely had me wondering what I would have done in the same situation.I did not like the beginning of the movie at all, it was far too slow and it did nothing to making me interested or empathetic to the characters (driving to the house & the conversation they were having about the music).  If I would have based whether I saw any more of the movie on that opening, I would have stopped watching five minutes in (in the story telling business of movies, movies are supposed to catch the audience within the first ten minutes of the opening).  I think the movie had too much set-up, the pacing was too slow for me.  I almost wanted them to start the story an hour in, and have me guessing as to what's going on and trying to catch than being dragged down too much by the set-up.  The audience does not need to know everything.  And I think he tension would have been much more intense, greater empathy for the characters, if they would have opened the story sooner.I would watch the movie again, and might even buy it for my collection to study certain parts of how they told the story.",3,Tea: Uncomfortable but good,1382227200,"10 20, 2013",2013,1982,"['Overall', 'was', 'lot', 'better', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'realize', 'say', 'lot', 'true', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'great', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Warning', 'not', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'So', 'what', ""'re"", 'looking', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'like', 'movie', 'all.The', 'story', 'middle', 'aged', 'couple', 'who', 'drive', 'out', 'vacation', 'home', 'soon', 'find', 'being', 'visited', 'two', 'young', 'college', 'age', 'men', 'apparent', 'friends', 'neighbors', 'two', 'men', 'are', ""n't"", 'what', 'seem', 'though.First', 'really', 'liked', 'how', 'different', 'story', 'was', 'liked', 'drama', 'tension', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'anything', 'being', 'blown', 'up', 'big', 'name', 'star', 'complicated', 'story', 'put', 'sort', 'simple', 'theme', 'Great', 'casting', 'strong', 'characters', 'very', 'eerie', 'dialogue', 'intense', 'scenes', 'did', ""n't"", 'revolve', 'around', 'showing', 'everything', 'scenario', 'definitely', 'had', 'wondering', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'same', 'situation.I', 'did', 'not', 'beginning', 'movie', 'was', 'far', 'too', 'slow', 'did', 'nothing', 'making', 'interested', 'empathetic', 'characters', 'driving', 'house', 'conversation', 'were', 'having', 'music', 'would', 'have', 'based', 'saw', 'more', 'movie', 'opening', 'would', 'have', 'stopped', 'watching', 'five', 'minutes', 'story', 'telling', 'business', 'movies', 'movies', 'are', 'supposed', 'catch', 'audience', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'opening', 'think', 'movie', 'had', 'too', 'much', 'set-up', 'pacing', 'was', 'too', 'slow', 'almost', 'wanted', 'start', 'story', 'hour', 'have', 'guessing', 'what', 'going', 'trying', 'catch', 'being', 'dragged', 'down', 'too', 'much', 'set-up', 'audience', 'not', 'need', 'know', 'everything', 'think', 'tension', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'intense', 'greater', 'empathy', 'characters', 'would', 'have', 'opened', 'story', 'sooner.I', 'would', 'watch', 'movie', 'again', 'might', 'even', 'buy', 'collection', 'study', 'certain', 'parts', 'how', 'told', 'story']",N/A

I've never seen the original and I have no interest in doing so now.SPOILERS AHEAD!!!I love a good scary movie-like Poltergeist or Rosemary's Baby. They have endings I can live with and think about hours after watching. After viewing Funny Games I don't wanna think anymore about the ending. I would like to pretend it ended differently- which is something most movies avoid. Not Funny Games.The plot is beyond simple. A family goes on vacation to a town on a lake where they own a home. On the way they pass by some friends acting strangely and they are accompanied by two men all in white. They get home and almost instantly a boy shows up asking for eggs. Things turn too uncomfortable too fast. Naomi Watts plays the wife and you can see the immediate discomfort on her face at once. The boy invites his friend in and she begs them to leave. Her husband comes inside to investigate why their dog is barking and finds her with these two boys inside the house. Things go downhill fast.The rest is pure torture- but not too brutally shown. What makes it soo eerie is the fact that the boys have been wearing gloves the entire time and no one seems to notice. This is not a movie for someone who can't stand to see a child being tortured as well. Yes, even the child isn't spared. The whole thing was just sadistic in nature.This is a game, a funny one. One in which the game is your life and either way you will lose. How you lose is up to you. But all will lose this funny game. These two 'masterminds' are nothing but bored kids who have nothing better to do and show no empathy. What makes the movie hard to swallow is the game is almost never ending. Once they take over a home and its occupants they are introduced to more neighbors and the cycle just continues. Never let a stranger into your home.I gave this movie three stars because whether I like it or not it plays like any other murder committed in real life. Most victims don't get happy endings due to their bravado or quick thinking. In fact theres an interesting scene in which Naomi is brave enough to shoot an intruder and the scene just rewinds itself and replays as if it never happened. The intruders have power over the family and they emotionally rape them long before they end the game. Its too dark for me to give a second viewing...I don't even want it in my house. It was almost like watching a real life grizzly home invasion from the comfort of my own home...which makes the experience all the more gross.",3,Never let in a stranger seeking eggs,1213228800,"06 12, 2008",2008,2575,"['just', 'finished', 'watching', 'immediately', 'put', 'romantic', 'comedy-', 'eerie', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'original', 'have', 'interest', 'doing', 'so', 'now.SPOILERS', 'AHEAD', 'love', 'good', 'scary', 'movie-like', 'Poltergeist', 'Rosemary', 'Baby', 'have', 'endings', 'can', 'live', 'think', 'hours', 'watching', 'viewing', 'Funny', 'Games', 'do', ""n't"", 'wan', 'na', 'think', 'anymore', 'ending', 'would', 'like', 'pretend', 'ended', 'differently-', 'something', 'most', 'movies', 'avoid', 'Not', 'Funny', 'Games.The', 'plot', 'simple', 'family', 'vacation', 'town', 'lake', 'where', 'own', 'home', 'way', 'pass', 'friends', 'acting', 'strangely', 'are', 'accompanied', 'two', 'men', 'white', 'get', 'home', 'almost', 'instantly', 'boy', 'up', 'asking', 'eggs', 'Things', 'turn', 'too', 'uncomfortable', 'too', 'fast', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'wife', 'can', 'see', 'immediate', 'discomfort', 'face', 'once', 'boy', 'friend', 'leave', 'husband', 'inside', 'investigate', 'why', 'dog', 'barking', 'two', 'boys', 'house', 'Things', 'go', 'downhill', 'fast.The', 'rest', 'pure', 'torture-', 'not', 'too', 'brutally', 'shown', 'What', 'soo', 'eerie', 'fact', 'boys', 'have', 'been', 'wearing', 'gloves', 'entire', 'time', 'one', 'notice', 'not', 'movie', 'someone', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'see', 'child', 'being', 'tortured', 'well', 'Yes', 'even', 'child', ""n't"", 'spared', 'whole', 'thing', 'was', 'just', 'sadistic', 'nature.This', 'game', 'funny', 'one', 'One', 'game', 'life', 'way', 'will', 'lose', 'How', 'lose', 'up', 'will', 'lose', 'funny', 'game', 'two', ""'masterminds"", 'are', 'nothing', 'bored', 'kids', 'who', 'have', 'nothing', 'better', 'do', 'show', 'empathy', 'What', 'movie', 'hard', 'swallow', 'game', 'almost', 'never', 'ending', 'take', 'over', 'home', 'occupants', 'are', 'introduced', 'more', 'neighbors', 'cycle', 'just', 'Never', 'let', 'stranger', 'home.I', 'gave', 'movie', 'three', 'stars', 'like', 'not', 'other', 'murder', 'committed', 'real', 'life', 'Most', 'victims', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'happy', 'endings', 'due', 'bravado', 'quick', 'thinking', 'fact', 'theres', 'interesting', 'scene', 'Naomi', 'brave', 'enough', 'shoot', 'intruder', 'scene', 'just', 'replays', 'never', 'happened', 'intruders', 'have', 'power', 'family', 'emotionally', 'rape', 'long', 'end', 'game', 'too', 'dark', 'give', 'second', 'viewing', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'want', 'house', 'was', 'almost', 'watching', 'real', 'life', 'grizzly', 'home', 'invasion', 'comfort', 'own', 'home', 'experience', 'more', 'gross']",N/A

And I consider myself very open-minded about films and am willing to meet a filmmaker halfway or even farther.However, I consider ""Funny Games"" to be irresponsible filmmaking. In fact, it's downright cruel-- to an audience, especially-- not to mention the cruelty that is unleashed on the characters throughout the picture.  This is not a pleasant film by any means-- even if you're a fan of extreme horror movies or unrelenting suspense pictures.  It is not entertaining.  Sure, perhaps as an intellectual exercise in the ""facade of violence"" that exists in motion pictures (which is what Haneke is saying), ""Funny Games"" is well-made, well-acted, and smart. Naomi Watts and Tim Roth give magnificent, heartbreaking performances.But for what?  After viewing the film, I felt as if I were one of the preppie killers-- and that's probably the point-- but I don't need it, thank you very much.  I got the point and it's not something that really should be made, IMHO. This is a film of excruciating psychological torture inflicted upon a family -- including a child and a dog -- whom we LIKE.  And again, that's the point.  But no thank you!  I don't need to see it!  There is enough real violence and terror in the real world. I don't want to see a family be terrorized for two hours and then murdered with no catharsis or redemption.  No thank you!You know, I don't want to believe that movies really influence people to do stuff, but there is evidence that they do.  ""A Clockwork Orange"" was banned in Britain for 20 years because there were some copycat killings that occurred soon after the film's release there in 1971.  What's-his-name Hinkley tried to shoot a president because he was influenced by ""Taxi Driver.""  I could see ""Funny Games"" influencing some deranged young men into committing these kinds of crimes.Mind you, I'm not for censorship in any way.  Let people see ""Funny Games"" if they want.

Zwick,"[2, 3]","Watching ""Funny Games"" is a bit like coming across a major accident on the highway - you know you should continue driving on past the scene, but you just can't keep yourself from slowing down and gawking at all the wreckage.The premise of the story does not sound very promising at first, as the idea, or a simple variation of it, has served as the foundation for countless such films in the past:  an innocent family of three is held hostage in their home by a couple of sadistic killers who systematically abuse and terrorize their victims for their own twisted pleasure.So many horror movies are predictable and formulaic that it's a pleasant surprise to come across one that actually makes an effort to break free of its bonds and make its own way in the world.  And, indeed, ""Funny Games"" busts through the horror movie conventions with an almost ruthless determination.  In this Americanized version of a film he made in his native Austria in 1997, director Michael Haneke scrupulously avoids obvious camera setups and editing techniques, bypassing virtually every storytelling, visual or audio clich&eacute; endemic to the genre.  There is no background music, for instance, to cue us into the scary moments, no screeching cats jumping out of the shadows, and no point-of-view shots designed to generate easy suspense.  Unlike in most films of this type, the violence here happens in an entirely haphazard and random manner, making it all the more frightening in its unpredictability and plausibility.  Haneke refuses to cater to the expectations of his audience, making them face the reality of the nightmare he's showing them rather than giving them what it is they may want to see.Michael Pitt and Brady Corbet are cringe-worthy and terminally creepy as the smarmy psychopaths who get their jollies out of watching other people suffer, while Naomi Watts, Tim Roth and Devon Gearhart engage our full sympathy as the hapless victims who have come up against the blank wall of two twisted minds they are woefully unequipped to even understand, let alone wage battle against.This is one of the most memorable and artful horror films of recent times, but it is also one of the most unnerving and difficult to watch.  The movie gets into your bones, no matter how much your better angels may be telling you to keep it out.

I saw a decent cast, but was leery of its watchability because maybe one out of five movies I rent are even remotely interesting these days. This was a pleasant surprise, although the movie itself is far from pleasant. It sure had me and the wife on edge the whole viewing.Now I see that there is quite a following of this particular director, and that the idea the film is driven by is some sort of social criticism, of which I was not aware of during the movie- and that's a good thing. I mean, looking back, I can see now what the point of the movie was, and it's a valid one. I studiously avoid torture flicks, except for the ones that are so camp that it's simply funny. If the director wants to whomp a few people over the head to send home the message that our tastes for video porn and violence are fairly disturbed and may say something about the viewer and its predilections for this type of entertainment, I can handle that. You get absolutely nothing from this film if you are expecting any of this, so be warned.That aside, what we have left is a well acted and realistic(save for the devices used by the director to make aforementioned point) depiction of a family murdered by a pair of psychopathic preppies. It's as ugly as it sounds, and no one is spared, and that includes you, dear viewer. This is a head movie-there are few traces of familiar narratives and traits of thiller/horror films-no gratuitous blood, no nudity, and most importantly, no resolution and no flinch from the psychological nightmare. I respect all of this, and any breaks from the conventionality of whatever genre you want to throw this in.

Well, we as the viewer can't help but notice has Haneke tries to break down the barriers of slandered horror fare.  Making the killers nice and polite with no motives other then being bored of the everyday routine, you just can't feel anything other then Haneke pushing his innovations on the viewer.  The script even goes as far as breaking the 4th wall and letting the killers talk to the audience, asking us what would we do and such.I'm all for innovation and clever writing, but there's better ways to mask it then what Haneke has accomplished with Funny Games.

For me and perhaps for others as well, the movie is distasteful because its subject is evil represented in all of its persistent nastiness however innocently and supposedly appealingly it appears.

It did the same to me; maybe for the same reason that at points during the picture a direct invitation is made to the viewer, and the reponse infects the imagination.

So, you think it is pointless that writer/director Michael Haneke remade his 1997 German film ""Funny Games"" into the 2008 American release? Did you ever consider that there are people out there who did not see the 1997 version? Well, guess what? I never saw it, and I am an avid film aficionado. Seeing the description of the film, I might not have watched it. When I saw the cast, specifically Naomi Watts, Tim Roth, and Michael Pitt, I knew I had to watch it. These are actors who are imminently watchable, and it is not the first venture into the horror genre for any of them. However, ""Funny Games"" is unlike any other horror film I have ever seen. It is a scathing indictment of how Americans have become nonchalant voyeurs of violence. The direction may be shot for shot like the original, but conceptually it is unique and scary. My heart was beating fast with fear, in many places, as I wondered what was going to happen next. The violence is almost never shown on film. It is almost always shown off screen or in the aftermath. So, we are not voyeurs to the violence in this movie. This only serves to heighten our fear. The acting was as brilliant as I expected it be from this superior cast. Not having seen the original, I found Michael Pitt talking into the camera to be quite amusing; not that it has never been done before, but it was done with alacrity. I thought the use of the remote control to rewind a crucial scene and change the ending of the scene to be an amazing twist; again, not having seen the original. The end of the movie, which I will not reveal, chilled me to the bone. There have been other remakes. Gus Van Sant's brightly colored, shot for shot remake of ""Psycho"" was unnecessary and boring. It added nothing to the movie. The remake of the French/Dutch film ""The Vanishing"", which was not shot for shot, was made by the original director with the same aim to bring it to an American audience. However, it was a poor imitation of the original, and was given a sappy ""Hollywood Happy Ending"". I am glad that Michael Haneke was allowed to make an American remake of ""Funny Games"" that is true to the original, for those of us who did not see the original. I, for one, will watch it again.",5,Funny Games 2008,1232841600,"01 25, 2009",2009,2255,"['Funny', 'Games', '2008', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'So', 'think', 'pointless', 'writer/director', 'Michael', 'Haneke', 'remade', '1997', 'German', 'film', 'Funny', 'Games', '2008', 'American', 'release', 'Did', 'ever', 'consider', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'see', '1997', 'version', 'Well', 'guess', 'what', 'never', 'saw', 'am', 'avid', 'film', 'aficionado', 'Seeing', 'description', 'film', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'watched', 'When', 'saw', 'cast', 'specifically', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'Michael', 'Pitt', 'knew', 'had', 'watch', 'are', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'imminently', 'watchable', 'not', 'first', 'venture', 'horror', 'genre', 'However', 'Funny', 'Games', 'other', 'horror', 'film', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'scathing', 'indictment', 'how', 'Americans', 'have', 'become', 'nonchalant', 'voyeurs', 'violence', 'direction', 'may', 'be', 'shot', 'shot', 'original', 'conceptually', 'unique', 'scary', 'heart', 'was', 'beating', 'fast', 'fear', 'many', 'places', 'wondered', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'next', 'violence', 'almost', 'never', 'shown', 'film', 'almost', 'always', 'shown', 'off', 'screen', 'aftermath', 'So', 'are', 'not', 'voyeurs', 'violence', 'movie', 'only', 'heighten', 'fear', 'acting', 'was', 'as', 'brilliant', 'expected', 'be', 'superior', 'cast', 'Not', 'having', 'seen', 'original', 'found', 'Michael', 'Pitt', 'talking', 'camera', 'be', 'quite', 'amusing', 'not', 'never', 'been', 'done', 'was', 'done', 'alacrity', 'thought', 'use', 'remote', 'control', 'rewind', 'crucial', 'scene', 'change', 'ending', 'scene', 'be', 'amazing', 'twist', 'again', 'not', 'having', 'seen', 'original', 'end', 'movie', 'will', 'not', 'reveal', 'chilled', 'bone', 'have', 'been', 'other', 'remakes', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'brightly', 'colored', 'shot', 'shot', 'remake', 'Psycho', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'boring', 'added', 'nothing', 'movie', 'remake', 'French/Dutch', 'film', 'Vanishing', 'was', 'not', 'shot', 'shot', 'was', 'made', 'original', 'director', 'same', 'aim', 'bring', 'American', 'audience', 'However', 'was', 'poor', 'imitation', 'original', 'was', 'given', 'sappy', 'Hollywood', 'Happy', 'Ending', 'am', 'glad', 'Michael', 'Haneke', 'was', 'allowed', 'make', 'American', 'remake', 'Funny', 'Games', 'true', 'original', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'original', 'one', 'will', 'watch', 'again']",N/A

1158669,AMNJJ9VAQEA86,B00187FPC2,Spunk Monkey,"[17, 26]","So you like ""horror films?"" Or perhaps you enjoy ""action"" or ""suspense"" thrillers where, at some point, people end up getting taken hostage or killed or something along those lines. The fact is that violence, more perhaps than even sexuality, is something to which we have in become innured, desensitized to, particularly in our ""entertainment,"" namely, films, books, television, music. This film, which I believe to be one of the most moral ever made, is exactly what it is advertised to be: a depiction of a family taken hostage and tortured.It is striking, surely, that people who sought out and consumed this film, knowing what it was about before going into it, critisize the film for its violence and the repulsive, unpsetting nature of its scenes. So, what did they ""expect"" instead? Fun torture? Sexy violence? A hostage laugh riot? All the tropes of the genre are here -- for instance, Ann gets stripped to her underwear and runs around half naked; except, on director Hanele's watch, you aren't allowed to get off on it. It's not fun. It's horrible. It's disgusting. It's deeply sad and unsettling. But why?In most films which exploit violence and terror, the ""trick"" is that suspense gets built up (e.g. the family gets taken hostage), but then at some point a ""catharsis"" is allowed the audience -- the tormentors get killed, the protagonists escape, revenge at last! We get a release. We get to ""enjoy"" the violence commited by our protagonists, in which we are vicariously allowed to ""get off"" on it because we have been allowed to feel their violence is justified because of the bad deeds the antagonists perpetrated against the victims. This allows us to enjoy the experience of torture and horror because we know that it's justifed. The horror of the victims is the ""means"" to the ""ends"" of enjoying the violent retribution and payback.But here, there is no catharsis for the audience. Ever. This is why it is so unsettling. We are not allowed to enjoy the violence. The only characters we can ever side with are the two young men -- but we are never given any points of reference regarding their lives or backstory -- we cannot connect to them or sympathize with them. Their violence is pure. Not justification given. The audience must then ask themselves, ""Why is violence not enjoyable in this film?"" The answer being, ""Because we are not given any justification through which we can trick ourselves, allow ourselves, to enjoy it. It is pure violence. It has no meaning. It is unrational and senseless. It is violence in its pure state, uncorrupted by our thoughts about it, rationalization of it, escuses for it.""And we as audience members are culpable. We wanted to see this film -- about a family being tormented -- and therefore, we, in effect, are responsible for the horrors we then have to endure. We are the cause. It's as if we ""hired"" the two young men to do what they do. That is the only meaning of the violence in the film. It is there because we wanted it.Don't let the claims that this film exploits violence fool you. It is one of the most moral, honest films ever made. It is about violence and what it is and what it means to be ""entertained"" by it. Sure you will be disgusted by this film. I truly hope you are. I hope you are utterly repulsed by what you see. It means there is still hope for you, that you are not like the sociopathic young men you feel nothing whatever about the violence they see or cause.This film is about the importance of self regulated moral action. In the world of this film, and, arguably, in the real world itself, there is no divine intervention which prevents violent acts commited by one human being against another, there is nothing to stop one person from hurting another at any time. All our order and structure in society is only there because we choose to abide by certain rules of conduct. But no one really has to do it. So why should we? Why shouldn't we torture, kill, and torment? It comes down to individual free choice regarding whether or not you wish to live in an ordered, rational world. If you do, then there's Kant's Categorical Imperative: #1) Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law, "" and #2) ""Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, always at the same time as an end and never merely as a means to an end.""Be brave. See this film. We should not lose sight of what violence is in and of itself beyond our justifications for it. Morality is a choice and we should never condone violence unless we don't mind it being perpetrated against ourselves as well...",5,A film of deep humanism and honesty.,1239840000,"04 16, 2009",2009,4678,"['So', 'horror', 'films', 'perhaps', 'enjoy', 'action', 'suspense', 'thrillers', 'where', 'point', 'people', 'end', 'up', 'getting', 'taken', 'hostage', 'killed', 'something', 'lines', 'fact', 'violence', 'more', 'perhaps', 'even', 'sexuality', 'something', 'have', 'become', 'innured', 'desensitized', 'particularly', 'entertainment', 'namely', 'films', 'books', 'television', 'music', 'film', 'believe', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'moral', 'ever', 'made', 'exactly', 'what', 'advertised', 'be', 'depiction', 'family', 'taken', 'hostage', 'tortured.It', 'striking', 'surely', 'people', 'who', 'sought', 'out', 'consumed', 'film', 'knowing', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'critisize', 'film', 'violence', 'repulsive', 'unpsetting', 'nature', 'scenes', 'So', 'what', 'did', 'expect', 'instead', 'Fun', 'torture', 'Sexy', 'violence', 'hostage', 'laugh', 'riot', 'tropes', 'genre', 'are', 'here', 'instance', 'Ann', 'stripped', 'underwear', 'half', 'naked', 'director', 'Hanele', 'watch', 'are', ""n't"", 'allowed', 'get', 'off', 'not', 'fun', 'horrible', 'disgusting', 'deeply', 'sad', 'unsettling', 'why', 'most', 'films', 'exploit', 'violence', 'terror', 'trick', 'suspense', 'built', 'up', 'e.g', 'family', 'taken', 'hostage', 'then', 'point', 'catharsis', 'allowed', 'audience', 'tormentors', 'get', 'killed', 'protagonists', 'escape', 'revenge', 'last', 'get', 'release', 'get', 'enjoy', 'violence', 'commited', 'protagonists', 'are', 'vicariously', 'allowed', 'get', 'off', 'have', 'been', 'allowed', 'feel', 'violence', 'justified', 'bad', 'antagonists', 'perpetrated', 'victims', 'enjoy', 'experience', 'torture', 'horror', 'know', 'justifed', 'horror', 'victims', 'means', 'ends', 'enjoying', 'violent', 'retribution', 'payback.But', 'here', 'catharsis', 'audience', 'Ever', 'why', 'so', 'unsettling', 'are', 'not', 'allowed', 'enjoy', 'violence', 'only', 'characters', 'can', 'ever', 'side', 'are', 'two', 'young', 'men', 'are', 'never', 'given', 'points', 'reference', 'regarding', 'lives', 'backstory', 'can', 'not', 'connect', 'sympathize', 'violence', 'pure', 'Not', 'justification', 'given', 'audience', 'must', 'then', 'ask', 'Why', 'violence', 'not', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'answer', 'being', 'are', 'not', 'given', 'justification', 'can', 'trick', 'allow', 'ourselves', 'enjoy', 'pure', 'violence', 'meaning', 'unrational', 'senseless', 'violence', 'pure', 'state', 'uncorrupted', 'thoughts', 'rationalization', 'audience', 'members', 'are', 'culpable', 'wanted', 'see', 'film', 'family', 'being', 'tormented', 'therefore', 'effect', 'are', 'responsible', 'horrors', 'then', 'have', 'endure', 'are', 'cause', 'hired', 'two', 'young', 'men', 'do', 'what', 'do', 'only', 'meaning', 'violence', 'film', 'there', 'wanted', 'it.Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'claims', 'film', 'violence', 'fool', 'one', 'most', 'moral', 'honest', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'violence', 'what', 'what', 'be', 'entertained', 'Sure', 'will', 'be', 'disgusted', 'film', 'truly', 'hope', 'are', 'hope', 'are', 'utterly', 'repulsed', 'what', 'see', 'still', 'hope', 'are', 'not', 'sociopathic', 'young', 'men', 'feel', 'nothing', 'violence', 'see', 'cause.This', 'film', 'importance', 'self', 'regulated', 'moral', 'action', 'world', 'film', 'arguably', 'real', 'world', 'divine', 'intervention', 'violent', 'acts', 'commited', 'one', 'human', 'being', 'nothing', 'stop', 'one', 'person', 'hurting', 'time', 'order', 'structure', 'society', 'only', 'there', 'choose', 'abide', 'certain', 'rules', 'conduct', 'one', 'really', 'do', 'So', 'why', 'should', 'Why', 'should', ""n't"", 'torture', 'kill', 'torment', 'down', 'individual', 'free', 'choice', 'regarding', 'not', 'wish', 'live', 'ordered', 'rational', 'world', 'do', 'then', 'Kant', 'Categorical', 'Imperative', '1', 'Act', 'only', 'according', 'maxim', 'whereby', 'can', 'same', 'time', 'will', 'should', 'become', 'universal', 'law', '2', 'Act', 'such', 'way', 'treat', 'humanity', 'own', 'person', 'person', 'other', 'always', 'same', 'time', 'end', 'never', 'merely', 'means', 'end', 'Be', 'brave', 'See', 'film', 'should', 'not', 'lose', 'sight', 'what', 'violence', 'justifications', 'Morality', 'choice', 'should', 'never', 'condone', 'violence', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'being', 'perpetrated', 'as', 'well']",N/A

The killers, played to creepy perfection by Michael Pitt and Brady Corbet, often look directly into the camera - at us, the audience, and dare us to continue watching.

1158671,A3JSOWJQ8EVOWJ,B00187FPC2,"Tdescombes ""Tracy McMillion Des Combes""","[3, 4]","I watched FUNNY GAMES without knowing anything about Michael Heneke's attempt at recreating the cult Austrian film he had made ten years earlier.  I was simply home, channel surfing, and landed on the opening credits of this incredibly disturbing and disarming film.When George and Ann Farber, with son Georgie and the family dog in tow, arrive at their gorgeous lakehouse, they are visited by two nice looking, polite young men, Peter and Paul.  The boys ask to borrow eggs, admire George's golf clubs, and seem on the whole normal (except for those creepy white gloves). Not so much. They quickly become menacing, then disturbing, then violent and finally morph into psychotic lunatics of the first order. By the movies end, these two have become the most sadistic, heinous, evil characters that I've ever seen on film.I'm not going to do a plot summary.  It's already been done quite well by other Amazonians.  I'll just say that if you are squeamish about violence, this is NOT the movie for you.  What Heneke is attempting to create with FUNNY GAMES is a virtual connection between characters and audience that goes way beyond that of simple viewer/performer. You are drawn in as accomplice, part of this nightmare, complicit in the torture and abuse the characters perpetuate upon their victims. You bought a ticket, so you should be enjoying the entertaining hijinks onscreen, right?  One of the boys, Paul, even breaks the fourth wall, suddenly looking into the camera and addressing you, his audience, with an engaging sly wink and the invitation to join in the mayhem. It's so disturbing, so unexpected and surprising, and it took me a moment to remember that Paul actually was the bad guy (which is exactly what Heneke is trying to do). Peter and Paul may be evil incarnate, but they have a decided cool streak, and who doesn't want to be one of the cool kids?  The finale breaks every rule of standard filmmaking, without revenge or redemption in even the tiniest of ways.Naomi Watts and Tim Roth are amazing, completely convincing as the victims. Watts in particular coveys this kind of intelligent desperation so well (THE IMPOSSIBLE is another great example of a similar character). Heneke hints that these two on some level deserve the abuse they experience.  The family is wealthy and good looking, have-it-all yuppies who maybe (ONLY maybe) deserve to be taken down a peg.  This feeling left me completely fifteen minutes into the film.  Nobody deserves this. Maybe Hitler, Stalin, Pol Pot. MAYBE.  The boys, Michael Pitt and Brady Corbitt, are terrifying, their snide disdain and uber creepy smiles shiver inducing.  Their prepster frat boy appearance, clean cut and handsome, makes their bloodlust and psychopathic actions that much harder to take in. I've got boys of my own this age, and it seems inconceivable that anyone, particularly these collegiate young men, be so downright crazy, so lacking of even the slightest traces of empathy or conscious.  The ending left me breathless, shocked and agog, surprised beyond even my own somewhat cynical ideas of acceptable plot structure.  A studio let them do this?FUNNY GAMES goes down as the most disturbing, albeit well made and fascinating, movie I've ever watched. I liked it, but it haunted me for weeks after, because the truth is that the evil depicted in FUNNY GAMES is closer to the real and true day-to-day evil occurring in our world all the time.  People kill other people painfully and gruesomely, bored, giggling, yawning, looking at their watches, all without pity or empathy or even emotion, and it happens all the time.  Movies may be violent, but they usually follow a fairly predictable path.

1158672,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B00187FPC2,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[4, 9]","Back in 1997 German director Michael Haneke made Funny Games, a disturbing and thought-provoking thriller that toys with the viewer's place as a voyeur. In 2008, the re-make, also directed by Haneke, debuts with an all new cast and this time in English. The problem is that it is essentially a shot-for-shot, line-for-line, verbatim re-shoot. This makes watching this film pointless if you've seen the original, or unnecessary to watch the original if you're planning on seeing the 2008 version. And despite those pesky subtitles that often upset American audiences, the original's authenticity and casting is surprisingly superior.Anne (Naomi Watts) and George (Tim Roth) arrive at their vacation home ready to enjoy some golf and sailing with their son (Devon Gearhart) and neighbors. As Anne is unpacking groceries, she is confronted by two young men, dressed in golf attire, and wearing white gloves. Thinking nothing of their politeness and harmless asking for eggs, explaining that the neighbors ran out of cooking materials, Anne immediately helps them. But when the two boys begin obviously antagonizing her, she realizes that their family is about to be taken hostage for a terrifying night of anything but ""funny"" games.The same opening overhead shot of a car (this time an SUV) driving down a desolate highway while the family inside plays a game of guessing opera tunes, opens the film. The same opera pieces are used, the same title sequence and the same ear-piercing abstract death metal. The film is undoubtedly disturbing, unique and white-knuckle suspenseful, but if you've seen the original, there's nothing new. The breed of dog changed, along with the style of phone (from mobile to cellular), but the house's white gate looks almost completely identical, and the kitchen and all of its seemingly random decorations are all a perfect match. Georg and Anna have been altered to their American counterparts George and Anne, and some of the original translations have been reinterpreted (such as fatty to tubby and cheeky to rude).What makes this remake only slightly more successful than Gus Van Sant's famously horrendous turn with Hitchcock's Psycho is that Funny Games was never that well known. Taking what many believe to be one of the greatest films of all time (Psycho) and re-doing it scene for scene is so utterly pointless, it's a wonder the idea was ever even carried out. At least with Funny Games the reasons are more coherent. Making a German film more accessible for American audiences through the use of English speaking actors isn't entirely inane.Devoid of an omniscient soundtrack and played out to feel like real-time, the events of this one freakish night is quite a distressingly entertaining ordeal. Regardless of the superiorities that are evident in the original, this version isn't without its shock value and thought-provoking commentary on voyeurism and violence. But with its unexpectedly appalling conclusion, bizarre plot twists and the unexplainable interference with the ""fourth wall"" (a.k.a. having characters talk directly to the audience), Funny Games may very well be a film that could never have been truly accepted by American audiences in the first place.- The Massie Twins",2,Funny Games (2008) Movie Review,1205539200,"03 15, 2008",2008,3231,"['Back', '1997', 'German', 'director', 'Michael', 'Haneke', 'made', 'Funny', 'Games', 'disturbing', 'thought-provoking', 'thriller', 'viewer', 'place', 'voyeur', '2008', 're-make', 'also', 'directed', 'Haneke', 'new', 'cast', 'time', 'English', 'problem', 'essentially', 'shot-for-shot', 'line-for-line', 'verbatim', 're-shoot', 'watching', 'film', 'pointless', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'original', 'unnecessary', 'watch', 'original', ""'re"", 'planning', 'seeing', '2008', 'version', 'pesky', 'subtitles', 'often', 'upset', 'American', 'audiences', 'original', 'authenticity', 'casting', 'surprisingly', 'superior.Anne', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'George', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'arrive', 'vacation', 'home', 'ready', 'enjoy', 'golf', 'sailing', 'son', 'Devon', 'Gearhart', 'neighbors', 'Anne', 'unpacking', 'groceries', 'confronted', 'two', 'young', 'men', 'dressed', 'golf', 'attire', 'wearing', 'white', 'gloves', 'Thinking', 'nothing', 'politeness', 'harmless', 'asking', 'eggs', 'explaining', 'neighbors', 'ran', 'cooking', 'materials', 'Anne', 'immediately', 'when', 'two', 'boys', 'begin', 'obviously', 'antagonizing', 'family', 'be', 'taken', 'hostage', 'terrifying', 'night', 'anything', 'funny', 'games.The', 'same', 'opening', 'overhead', 'shot', 'car', 'time', 'SUV', 'driving', 'down', 'desolate', 'highway', 'family', 'inside', 'game', 'guessing', 'opera', 'tunes', 'film', 'same', 'opera', 'pieces', 'are', 'used', 'same', 'title', 'sequence', 'same', 'ear-piercing', 'abstract', 'death', 'metal', 'film', 'undoubtedly', 'disturbing', 'unique', 'white-knuckle', 'suspenseful', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'original', 'nothing', 'new', 'breed', 'dog', 'changed', 'style', 'phone', 'mobile', 'cellular', 'house', 'white', 'gate', 'almost', 'completely', 'identical', 'kitchen', 'seemingly', 'random', 'decorations', 'are', 'perfect', 'match', 'Georg', 'Anna', 'have', 'been', 'altered', 'American', 'counterparts', 'George', 'Anne', 'original', 'translations', 'have', 'been', 'reinterpreted', 'such', 'fatty', 'tubby', 'cheeky', 'rude', 'remake', 'only', 'slightly', 'more', 'successful', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'famously', 'horrendous', 'turn', 'Hitchcock', 'Psycho', 'Funny', 'Games', 'was', 'never', 'that', 'well', 'known', 'Taking', 'what', 'many', 'believe', 'be', 'one', 'greatest', 'films', 'time', 'Psycho', 're-doing', 'scene', 'scene', 'so', 'utterly', 'pointless', 'wonder', 'idea', 'was', 'ever', 'even', 'carried', 'out', 'least', 'Funny', 'Games', 'reasons', 'are', 'more', 'coherent', 'Making', 'German', 'film', 'more', 'accessible', 'American', 'audiences', 'use', 'English', 'speaking', 'actors', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'inane.Devoid', 'omniscient', 'soundtrack', 'played', 'out', 'feel', 'real-time', 'events', 'one', 'freakish', 'night', 'quite', 'distressingly', 'entertaining', 'ordeal', 'Regardless', 'superiorities', 'are', 'evident', 'original', 'version', ""n't"", 'shock', 'value', 'thought-provoking', 'commentary', 'voyeurism', 'violence', 'unexpectedly', 'appalling', 'conclusion', 'bizarre', 'plot', 'twists', 'unexplainable', 'interference', 'fourth', 'wall', 'a.k.a', 'having', 'characters', 'talk', 'directly', 'audience', 'Funny', 'Games', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'film', 'could', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'truly', 'accepted', 'American', 'audiences', 'first', 'place.-', 'Massie', 'Twins']",N/A

They bind, gag, maim, and terrorize while never losing their bland smiles or impeccable manners. Their real game is power. At first, one of them (Brady Corbet) comes over to borrow some eggs. He's shy and polite, but he won't leave. Neither will his friend (Michael Pitt) who wanders in through the screen door to join him.Director Michael Haneke works in clean organized shots, and a real-time pace (think Stanley Kubrick). One of the ghoulish jokes of the film is that the tormenters are such fresh-faced Aryan preppies they act as if it's the victims who are being rude. Smashing the husband's knee with a golf club, they turn torture into a rite of aristocratic privilege. They make the ultimate mockery of WASP manners by punishing the family for failing to live up to them. (It should be mentioned that FUNNY GAMES  is a shot-for-shot, line-for-line remake of Haneke's 1997 film of the same name, which was made in Austria. This new version is very nearly the same film.)In an America that treats the psycho-slasher genre and all their sequels as been-there-done-that retreads, FUNNY GAMES may sound like a movie many teens would call a fun night. But in Europe,  it's an art film. If you enjoy it, the director implies, then on some level you're complicit in what it's showing you. By sitting there, you too are helping to turn violence into entertainment. (At several points, Pitt's insinuating ringleader breaks the fourth wall and speaks directly to the audience.) Haneke has designed it, knowingly, as a lofty exploitation film. Both gripping and repellent, FUNNY GAMES, is a sadistic and terrifying thriller made with brutal fascination and skill.",4,A Primal Experience Disguised As An Entertainment.,1213056000,"06 10, 2008",2008,2075,"['wealthy', 'secluded', 'neighborhood', 'family', 'three', 'staying', 'airy', 'summer', 'cottage', 'are', 'trapped', 'house', 'pair', 'preppy', 'psychos', 'who', 'drop', 'proceed', 'tease', 'torture', 'them.The', 'family', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'young', 'son', 'Devon', 'Gearhart', 'are', 'nice', 'tasteful', 'attractive', 'pampered', 'monsters', 'tennis', 'whites', 'white', 'gloves', 'are', 'Leopold', 'Loeb', 'reimagined', 'Abercrombie', 'Fitch', 'bind', 'gag', 'maim', 'terrorize', 'never', 'losing', 'bland', 'smiles', 'impeccable', 'manners', 'real', 'game', 'power', 'first', 'one', 'Brady', 'Corbet', 'borrow', 'eggs', 'shy', 'polite', 'wo', ""n't"", 'leave', 'will', 'friend', 'Michael', 'Pitt', 'who', 'screen', 'door', 'join', 'him.Director', 'Michael', 'Haneke', 'clean', 'organized', 'shots', 'real-time', 'pace', 'think', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'One', 'ghoulish', 'jokes', 'film', 'tormenters', 'are', 'such', 'fresh-faced', 'Aryan', 'preppies', 'act', 'victims', 'who', 'are', 'being', 'rude', 'Smashing', 'husband', 'knee', 'golf', 'club', 'turn', 'torture', 'rite', 'aristocratic', 'privilege', 'make', 'ultimate', 'mockery', 'WASP', 'manners', 'punishing', 'family', 'failing', 'live', 'up', 'should', 'be', 'mentioned', 'FUNNY', 'GAMES', 'shot-for-shot', 'line-for-line', 'remake', 'Haneke', '1997', 'film', 'same', 'name', 'was', 'made', 'Austria', 'new', 'version', 'very', 'nearly', 'same', 'film', 'America', 'psycho-slasher', 'genre', 'sequels', 'been-there-done-that', 'retreads', 'FUNNY', 'GAMES', 'may', 'sound', 'movie', 'many', 'teens', 'would', 'call', 'fun', 'night', 'Europe', 'art', 'film', 'enjoy', 'director', 'implies', 'then', 'level', ""'re"", 'complicit', 'what', 'showing', 'sitting', 'there', 'too', 'are', 'helping', 'turn', 'violence', 'entertainment', 'several', 'points', 'Pitt', 'insinuating', 'ringleader', 'fourth', 'wall', 'speaks', 'directly', 'audience', 'Haneke', 'designed', 'knowingly', 'lofty', 'exploitation', 'film', 'gripping', 'repellent', 'FUNNY', 'GAMES', 'sadistic', 'terrifying', 'thriller', 'made', 'brutal', 'fascination', 'skill']",N/A

1158676,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B00187FPC2,Tim Janson,"[2, 2]","Funny Games was a difficult film to review.  On one hand there are numerous outstanding elements to this horror/psychological thriller.  On the other hand, the Director tries to be a bit too cute and threatens to drag the entire film down the drain.  Funny Games is a shot-for-shot remake of the original Austrian film (also directed by Michael Haneke) that came out in 1997.  Haneke remade the film in order to reach a broader U.S. audience who typically eschews foreign movies.Naomi Watts and Tim Roth play Ann and George who, along with son George Jr., have come to stay at their lakefront vacation home.  Their idyllic holiday soon turns to horror with the arrival of two young men who look like they just walked off the campus of some Ivy League school in their white, preppy golf attire.  Under the pretense of wanting to borrow eggs for a neighbor, they break George's leg with a golf club and soon put the entire family through an excruciating series of mind games, and mental and physical abuse.Paul (Michael Pitt) and Peter (Brady Corbet) are truly terrifying because they are the antithesis of what we normally think of when it comes to screen psychos.  They appear innocent, almost angelic in their appearance, even down to their white golf gloves and their baby faces.  Their unfailing politeness, even as they torment and threaten the family is unsettling to say the least.One eerie debate takes place between the young men about whether Ann is physically fit or not.  They force her to strip naked in front of her husband although they are respectful enough to cover the son's head so he cannot see.  The thing about this scene is you legitimately feel that they really did make her strip to settle their debate, and not just for the cheap thrill of seeing her nude.  They allow her to get dressed immediately after. When Ann asks why they just don't kill them, Paul courteously replies that there would be no entertainment in that.Understand, Paul is not talking about his or Peter's entertainment; he's talking about the audience's entertainment.  We are the voyeurs to this disturbing scene and the pair is aware of our presence.  Funny Games breaks down that fourth wall of reality.  Several times throughout the film Paul looks directly into the camera and speaks to the audience as if they were casual bystanders.  At times they are seemingly looking for our approval and other times they are merely informing us of their thoughts.  However, it's the infamous ""rewind"" scene that has caused the most stir with the film.  This destroys the audience's usual expectations for a film of this type.  Haneke was trying too hard to send the message that ours is a violent society and sometimes we can do nothing but just watch helplessly.  The message could have been conveyed without the cheap parlor tricks.Pitt's performance is engaging and frightening.  This is a guy who most men could beat the snot out of and yet you'd never want to turn your back on him.  His performance is even better than the one he gave in the equally disturbing 2001 film ""Bully"".  Corbett is also outstanding as the overly sensitive, yet equally psychotic, Peter.  Watts, Roth and even Devon Gearheart as George Jr. all adeptly display a sense of fear and helplessness.This is not a torture porn film. In fact, it is quite the opposite.  Most of the violence, certainly the worst of it, takes place off camera and we only hear it happen and listen the anguished cries.  Haneke does tend to linger too long on certain scenes such as Ann struggling to get to her feet for about five minutes when her hands and feet are bound.  Haneke has made a film that tries too much to be an Art House film rather than a horror film and falls just short of being brilliant.",4,NOT FOR EVERYONE'S TASTES,1219363200,"08 22, 2008",2008,3753,"['Funny', 'Games', 'was', 'difficult', 'film', 'review', 'one', 'hand', 'are', 'numerous', 'outstanding', 'elements', 'horror/psychological', 'thriller', 'other', 'hand', 'Director', 'tries', 'be', 'bit', 'too', 'cute', 'drag', 'entire', 'film', 'down', 'drain', 'Funny', 'Games', 'shot-for-shot', 'remake', 'original', 'Austrian', 'film', 'also', 'directed', 'Michael', 'Haneke', 'came', 'out', '1997', 'Haneke', 'remade', 'film', 'order', 'reach', 'broader', 'U.S.', 'audience', 'who', 'typically', 'eschews', 'foreign', 'movies.Naomi', 'Watts', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'play', 'Ann', 'George', 'who', 'son', 'George', 'Jr.', 'have', 'come', 'stay', 'lakefront', 'vacation', 'home', 'idyllic', 'holiday', 'soon', 'horror', 'arrival', 'two', 'young', 'men', 'who', 'look', 'just', 'walked', 'off', 'campus', 'Ivy', 'League', 'school', 'white', 'preppy', 'golf', 'attire', 'pretense', 'wanting', 'borrow', 'eggs', 'neighbor', 'break', 'George', 'leg', 'golf', 'club', 'soon', 'put', 'entire', 'family', 'excruciating', 'series', 'mind', 'games', 'mental', 'physical', 'abuse.Paul', 'Michael', 'Pitt', 'Peter', 'Brady', 'Corbet', 'are', 'truly', 'terrifying', 'are', 'antithesis', 'what', 'normally', 'think', 'when', 'screen', 'psychos', 'appear', 'innocent', 'almost', 'angelic', 'appearance', 'even', 'down', 'white', 'golf', 'gloves', 'baby', 'unfailing', 'politeness', 'even', 'torment', 'threaten', 'family', 'unsettling', 'say', 'least.One', 'eerie', 'debate', 'place', 'young', 'men', 'Ann', 'physically', 'fit', 'not', 'force', 'strip', 'naked', 'front', 'husband', 'are', 'respectful', 'enough', 'cover', 'son', 'head', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'thing', 'scene', 'legitimately', 'feel', 'really', 'did', 'make', 'strip', 'settle', 'debate', 'not', 'just', 'cheap', 'thrill', 'seeing', 'nude', 'allow', 'get', 'dressed', 'immediately', 'When', 'Ann', 'why', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'kill', 'Paul', 'courteously', 'would', 'be', 'entertainment', 'that.Understand', 'Paul', 'not', 'talking', 'Peter', 'entertainment', 'talking', 'audience', 'entertainment', 'are', 'voyeurs', 'disturbing', 'scene', 'pair', 'aware', 'presence', 'Funny', 'Games', 'breaks', 'down', 'fourth', 'wall', 'reality', 'Several', 'times', 'film', 'Paul', 'directly', 'camera', 'speaks', 'audience', 'were', 'casual', 'bystanders', 'times', 'are', 'seemingly', 'looking', 'approval', 'other', 'times', 'are', 'merely', 'informing', 'thoughts', 'However', 'infamous', 'rewind', 'scene', 'caused', 'most', 'stir', 'film', 'audience', 'usual', 'expectations', 'film', 'type', 'Haneke', 'was', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'send', 'message', 'violent', 'society', 'sometimes', 'can', 'do', 'nothing', 'just', 'watch', 'helplessly', 'message', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'conveyed', 'cheap', 'parlor', 'tricks.Pitt', 'performance', 'engaging', 'frightening', 'guy', 'who', 'most', 'men', 'could', 'beat', 'snot', 'yet', ""'d"", 'never', 'want', 'turn', 'back', 'performance', 'even', 'better', 'one', 'gave', 'equally', 'disturbing', '2001', 'film', 'Bully', 'Corbett', 'also', 'outstanding', 'overly', 'sensitive', 'yet', 'equally', 'psychotic', 'Peter', 'Watts', 'Roth', 'even', 'Devon', 'Gearheart', 'George', 'Jr.', 'adeptly', 'display', 'sense', 'fear', 'helplessness.This', 'not', 'torture', 'porn', 'film', 'fact', 'quite', 'opposite', 'Most', 'violence', 'certainly', 'worst', 'place', 'camera', 'only', 'hear', 'happen', 'listen', 'anguished', 'cries', 'Haneke', 'tend', 'linger', 'too', 'long', 'certain', 'scenes', 'such', 'Ann', 'struggling', 'get', 'feet', 'about', 'five', 'minutes', 'when', 'hands', 'feet', 'are', 'bound', 'Haneke', 'made', 'film', 'too', 'much', 'be', 'Art', 'House', 'film', 'rather', 'horror', 'film', 'just', 'short', 'being', 'brilliant']",N/A

That's the great debater's point, after all, showing us all the things hidden amongst the stars while secretly decoding the universe. From gravity to atoms to the mind and beyond, we crave explanation because it gives us comfort. Still, there are times when comfort cannot be found. In Funny Games, we have a situation where reason really does not apply. Sure, we can say that we have depraved people or bored people or horrible people, but do we really know what they are? They are horrific in their means and they keep us guessing, but the end of the movie provides no more evidence as to why they have done what they have done - and perhaps that is why the movie is fascinating despite some very glaring flaws.The flaws - there is a scene in the movie that bothers me, a rewind scene, that says ""this is a movie."" This is bothersome. There are times in the mvoie that lag and drag and hammer home the point that there is torment going on. That is bothersome. And there are the victims that cannot think outside of their little solutions - the cellular drytimes and the running and hiding - and that really made me think how terribly dumb they were. Like rabbits, they simply looked for holes to crawl into. These flaws are huge in some places, too, and are even more drawn out in the ""unrated versions"" of the movie. The original showing didn't put all of this in - bless it - and you were spared a lot of the dragging sounds that really felt like time being hit atop the head and being drug across the screen. Still, the depravity of the movie makes this a confusing topic.The fun - The movie has a lot of fun places, adn the actors really make you buy how screwed up everything here is. A person comes over to borrow something, won't leave, and then introduces you to your old pal, Mr. golf club. After that, you try and escape and the two people play terrible games with your family, and you wish you could play more fairly. This culminates in the villiany of one simple bet: ""I bet you that, by noon, your family will be dead (bad paraphrasing -forgive me)."" Not a fun thing, huh? But you do have plenty of chances to cash that check and get away, and that's where the games come in. So, you want to keep watching.And the draw? Well, like moths to a flame, I have to know something once I jump in. I wanted to see if they would live, if they could live, or if this movie would be different. I also wanted to know about the boy - in movies children seem to get a free ride and I wanted to know if this would be different. Was it? Well, that depends on what you call different. It was odd, truth be told, and the people playing were all sloppy and hopefully not reflections of the majority of us if caught in this type of situation. and then there's the question - would i have watched this if I knew about the movie ahead of time?If I had a chance to watch it without the unedited cut, I would possibly do so. I wouldn't recommend it, though, because it would have to be an acquired taste. In all honesty, the actors are the people earning the stars, as are the deeds that happen. Were it not for that, I would say ""no"" to the whole thing. Would i say that you should watch it - no. But then I am just a voice with an opinion and I did like the movie somewhat. So, honestly, this thing is confusing. And i suppose that is a big point in th emovie - the confusion of the why. I imagine the direction was not meant to fall out into a ""why bother,"" however, when everything was said and done.",3,"Confusion on saying ""watch it"" or ""no!""",1260576000,"12 12, 2009",2009,3590,"['Perhaps', 'most', 'horrible', 'thing', 'something', 'when', 'really', 'do', 'not', 'comprehend', 'why', 'great', 'debater', 'point', 'showing', 'things', 'hidden', 'stars', 'secretly', 'decoding', 'universe', 'gravity', 'atoms', 'mind', 'crave', 'explanation', 'comfort', 'Still', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'comfort', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'found', 'Funny', 'Games', 'have', 'situation', 'where', 'reason', 'really', 'not', 'apply', 'Sure', 'can', 'say', 'have', 'depraved', 'people', 'bored', 'people', 'horrible', 'people', 'do', 'really', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'are', 'horrific', 'means', 'keep', 'guessing', 'end', 'movie', 'more', 'evidence', 'why', 'have', 'done', 'what', 'have', 'done', 'perhaps', 'why', 'movie', 'fascinating', 'very', 'glaring', 'flaws.The', 'flaws', 'scene', 'movie', 'bothers', 'rewind', 'scene', 'movie', 'bothersome', 'are', 'times', 'mvoie', 'lag', 'drag', 'hammer', 'home', 'point', 'torment', 'going', 'bothersome', 'are', 'victims', 'can', 'not', 'think', 'little', 'solutions', 'cellular', 'drytimes', 'running', 'hiding', 'really', 'made', 'think', 'how', 'terribly', 'were', 'rabbits', 'simply', 'looked', 'holes', 'crawl', 'flaws', 'are', 'huge', 'places', 'too', 'are', 'even', 'more', 'drawn', 'out', 'unrated', 'versions', 'movie', 'original', 'showing', 'did', ""n't"", 'put', 'bless', 'were', 'spared', 'lot', 'dragging', 'sounds', 'really', 'felt', 'like', 'time', 'being', 'hit', 'head', 'being', 'drug', 'screen', 'Still', 'depravity', 'movie', 'confusing', 'topic.The', 'fun', 'movie', 'lot', 'fun', 'places', 'adn', 'actors', 'really', 'make', 'buy', 'how', 'screwed', 'up', 'everything', 'here', 'person', 'borrow', 'something', 'wo', ""n't"", 'leave', 'then', 'introduces', 'old', 'pal', 'Mr.', 'golf', 'club', 'try', 'escape', 'two', 'people', 'play', 'terrible', 'games', 'family', 'wish', 'could', 'play', 'more', 'fairly', 'villiany', 'one', 'simple', 'bet', 'bet', 'noon', 'family', 'will', 'be', 'dead', 'bad', 'paraphrasing', '-forgive', 'Not', 'fun', 'thing', 'huh', 'do', 'have', 'plenty', 'chances', 'cash', 'check', 'get', 'away', 'where', 'games', 'come', 'So', 'want', 'keep', 'draw', 'Well', 'moths', 'flame', 'have', 'know', 'something', 'once', 'jump', 'wanted', 'see', 'would', 'live', 'could', 'live', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'different', 'also', 'wanted', 'know', 'boy', 'movies', 'children', 'seem', 'get', 'free', 'ride', 'wanted', 'know', 'would', 'be', 'different', 'Was', 'Well', 'what', 'call', 'different', 'was', 'odd', 'truth', 'be', 'told', 'people', 'playing', 'were', 'sloppy', 'hopefully', 'not', 'reflections', 'majority', 'caught', 'type', 'situation', 'then', 'question', 'would', 'i', 'have', 'watched', 'knew', 'movie', 'ahead', 'time', 'had', 'chance', 'watch', 'unedited', 'cut', 'would', 'possibly', 'do', 'so', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'though', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'acquired', 'taste', 'honesty', 'actors', 'are', 'people', 'earning', 'stars', 'are', 'deeds', 'happen', 'Were', 'not', 'would', 'say', 'whole', 'thing', 'Would', 'i', 'say', 'should', 'watch', 'then', 'am', 'just', 'voice', 'opinion', 'did', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'So', 'honestly', 'thing', 'confusing', 'i', 'suppose', 'big', 'point', 'th', 'emovie', 'confusion', 'why', 'imagine', 'direction', 'was', 'not', 'meant', 'fall', 'out', 'why', 'bother', 'however', 'when', 'everything', 'was', 'said', 'done']",N/A

These two lines are the very base for the message behind Funny Games, a stark, unrelenting look at America's infatuation with violence and torture.This is an English version remake of the 1997 German Funny Games, by the very same director Michael Haneke. Haneke wanted his original film to reach a broader audience, especially America since his inspiration for the film was his fascination with America's desensitized appetite for gore and violent torture. The premise is very simple: a well-to-do American family, George (Tim Roth), Ann (Naomi Watts), and Georgie (Devon Gearhart), arrive at their summer home for a relaxing vacation and are held hostage in their own home by two deranged young men, Paul (Michael Pitt) and Peter (Brady Corbet), who play a ""game"" with the family that consists of tormenting the family physically and psychologically.Normally I would never have seen this film, as I have vowed never to see any type of slasher/torture-porn. However after reading about the director's vision of trying to show the audience how sickening the watching of graphic torture for entertainment really is, I knew I had to see it.Unlike the hypocritical Untraceable or The Condemned, this film does exactly what it intends to do. This film gets in your head by giving the pretense that you will witness all the horrible acts, and then turns around on you by not showing anything! Everything is off-screen so you are left with only the sound effects. Which is more disturbing as your imagination sets to work on the images off screen, and that in itself is more horrifying. You finally reacha ponit of ""Why am I watching this?"" and that is a good thing because it is supposed to make you consider the pointlessness of these kind of films. I makes you realize that these types of films are boring with out the gory violent torture to make it exciting and shocking, but at the same time you feel ashamed to whish you could see more blood and guts.Haneke crafts a superbly intelligent psychological horror, but almost too intelligent as it almost falters on expecting you to know the philosophy behind the filmmaking and for someone knowing nothing about the film it might be confusing or frustrating.I would not recommend this film to everyone as it will disappoint the Saw/Hostel audience and may confuse newcomers. With that aside, I greatly welcomed the dissection of violence, and someone who understands the point of the film and enjoys art house-style filmmaking will appreciate it.",4,"""You shouldn't forget the importance of entertainment.""",1205712000,"03 17, 2008",2008,2590,"['Ann', 'Why', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'kill', 'Peter', 'should', ""n't"", 'forget', 'importance', 'entertainment', 'two', 'lines', 'are', 'very', 'base', 'message', 'Funny', 'Games', 'stark', 'unrelenting', 'look', 'America', 'infatuation', 'violence', 'torture.This', 'English', 'version', 'remake', '1997', 'German', 'Funny', 'Games', 'very', 'same', 'director', 'Michael', 'Haneke', 'Haneke', 'wanted', 'original', 'film', 'reach', 'broader', 'audience', 'especially', 'America', 'inspiration', 'film', 'was', 'fascination', 'America', 'desensitized', 'appetite', 'gore', 'violent', 'torture', 'premise', 'very', 'simple', 'well-to-do', 'American', 'family', 'George', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'Ann', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'Georgie', 'Devon', 'Gearhart', 'arrive', 'summer', 'home', 'relaxing', 'vacation', 'are', 'held', 'hostage', 'own', 'home', 'two', 'deranged', 'young', 'men', 'Paul', 'Michael', 'Pitt', 'Peter', 'Brady', 'Corbet', 'who', 'play', 'game', 'family', 'tormenting', 'family', 'physically', 'psychologically.Normally', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'have', 'vowed', 'never', 'see', 'type', 'slasher/torture-porn', 'However', 'reading', 'director', 'vision', 'trying', 'show', 'audience', 'how', 'sickening', 'watching', 'graphic', 'torture', 'entertainment', 'really', 'knew', 'had', 'see', 'hypocritical', 'Untraceable', 'Condemned', 'film', 'exactly', 'what', 'do', 'film', 'head', 'giving', 'pretense', 'will', 'witness', 'horrible', 'acts', 'then', 'around', 'not', 'showing', 'anything', 'Everything', 'off-screen', 'are', 'left', 'only', 'sound', 'effects', 'Which', 'more', 'disturbing', 'imagination', 'sets', 'work', 'images', 'screen', 'more', 'horrifying', 'finally', 'reacha', 'ponit', 'Why', 'am', 'watching', 'good', 'thing', 'supposed', 'make', 'consider', 'pointlessness', 'kind', 'films', 'realize', 'types', 'films', 'are', 'boring', 'out', 'gory', 'violent', 'torture', 'make', 'exciting', 'shocking', 'same', 'time', 'feel', 'ashamed', 'whish', 'could', 'see', 'more', 'blood', 'guts.Haneke', 'crafts', 'superbly', 'intelligent', 'psychological', 'horror', 'almost', 'too', 'intelligent', 'almost', 'falters', 'expecting', 'know', 'philosophy', 'filmmaking', 'someone', 'knowing', 'nothing', 'film', 'might', 'be', 'confusing', 'frustrating.I', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'film', 'everyone', 'will', 'disappoint', 'Saw/Hostel', 'audience', 'may', 'confuse', 'newcomers', 'aside', 'greatly', 'welcomed', 'dissection', 'violence', 'someone', 'who', 'point', 'film', 'art', 'house-style', 'filmmaking', 'will', 'appreciate']",N/A
1158681,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00187FPC2,Tsuyoshi,"[5, 7]","Michael Haneke's ""Funny Games U.S"" (2007) is a shot-by-shot remake of the original helmed by the same director in 1997. My simple question is - So why not see the original?""Funny Games U.S"" is based on a premise familiar to thriller fans. If you have seen ""The Desperate Hours"" (or its remake), you know what I am talking about - strangers taking hostage of an average (or affluent) family. There are several major differences here, though. These ""strangers"" are not escaped convicts played by Humphrey Bogart or Mickey Rourke; they are ""Paul"" and ""Peter,"" two young men always wearing white gloves, played by Michael Pitt and Brady Corbet. They will visit your vacation house on the lakeshore, politely asking for some eggs. You should never let them in, but according to the rules of thriller, you have to, no matter how stupid you really think it is.It is true Michael Haneke keeps you on the edge of your seat. ""Funny Games U.S"" is a disturbing experience in more than one sense. For the most people the opening drawn-out ""egg"" episode alone would be annoying enough. In the subsequent scenes Haneke is so good at unnerving us with suspense, violence, tortures (verbal and physical) and pains that are so realistic, that we almost forget some major plot holes.But of course, Michael Haneke knows all. Or maybe he is too smart. One character even breaks the fourth wall to make contact with the audience. Yes, he reminds us that we pay to watch a film to see violent acts while we are in the safe place. To be fair, Haneke knows much about the rules of thriller, and how to use them effectively. The difference is, he is determined not to give us what we (or most of us) would expect in the genre. His decision is admirable considering that it means the film is virtually ""unsellable.""It seems people find the film uncomfortable. But perhaps what really annoys and irritates us is neither the film's violence itself nor the message of Haneke. No, it is his smugness that ruins what is good in ""Funny Games U.S."" We in fact know what Haneke tells us. We know exactly what our ""guilty pleasure"" is like. We are briefly reminded of our sense of guilt, but what else does the film offer? More importantly, he is so eager and earnest in attacking the too obvious target that it seems he has become part of it. Making a point about violence is one thing; over-indulging yourself in the exercise is another.The husband and the wife are played by Tim Roth and Naomi Watts respectively. The acting of the entire cast is all fascinating, I admit. Their pains on the face look so real and the kid's terrified expression is painful to see, not an easy one to forget. I sincerely hope they were really acting.",2,Smugness Kills,1236902400,"03 13, 2009",2009,2699,"['Michael', 'Haneke', 'Funny', 'Games', 'U.S', '2007', 'shot-by-shot', 'remake', 'original', 'helmed', 'same', 'director', '1997', 'simple', 'question', 'So', 'why', 'not', 'see', 'original', 'Funny', 'Games', 'U.S', 'based', 'premise', 'familiar', 'thriller', 'fans', 'have', 'seen', 'Desperate', 'Hours', 'remake', 'know', 'what', 'am', 'talking', 'strangers', 'taking', 'hostage', 'average', 'affluent', 'family', 'are', 'several', 'major', 'differences', 'here', 'though', 'strangers', 'are', 'not', 'escaped', 'convicts', 'played', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'are', 'Paul', 'Peter', 'two', 'young', 'men', 'always', 'wearing', 'white', 'gloves', 'played', 'Michael', 'Pitt', 'Brady', 'Corbet', 'will', 'visit', 'vacation', 'house', 'lakeshore', 'politely', 'asking', 'eggs', 'should', 'never', 'let', 'according', 'rules', 'thriller', 'have', 'matter', 'how', 'stupid', 'really', 'think', 'true', 'Michael', 'Haneke', 'edge', 'seat', 'Funny', 'Games', 'U.S', 'disturbing', 'experience', 'more', 'one', 'sense', 'most', 'people', 'opening', 'drawn-out', 'egg', 'episode', 'alone', 'would', 'be', 'annoying', 'enough', 'subsequent', 'scenes', 'Haneke', 'so', 'good', 'unnerving', 'suspense', 'violence', 'tortures', 'verbal', 'physical', 'are', 'so', 'realistic', 'almost', 'forget', 'major', 'plot', 'holes.But', 'course', 'Michael', 'Haneke', 'maybe', 'too', 'smart', 'One', 'character', 'even', 'fourth', 'wall', 'make', 'contact', 'audience', 'Yes', 'pay', 'watch', 'film', 'see', 'violent', 'acts', 'are', 'safe', 'place', 'be', 'fair', 'Haneke', 'much', 'rules', 'thriller', 'how', 'use', 'effectively', 'difference', 'determined', 'not', 'give', 'what', 'most', 'would', 'expect', 'genre', 'decision', 'admirable', 'considering', 'film', 'virtually', 'unsellable', 'people', 'find', 'film', 'uncomfortable', 'perhaps', 'what', 'really', 'annoys', 'film', 'violence', 'message', 'Haneke', 'No', 'smugness', 'what', 'good', 'Funny', 'Games', 'U.S.', 'fact', 'know', 'what', 'Haneke', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'are', 'briefly', 'reminded', 'sense', 'guilt', 'what', 'else', 'film', 'offer', 'More', 'importantly', 'so', 'eager', 'earnest', 'attacking', 'too', 'obvious', 'target', 'become', 'part', 'Making', 'point', 'violence', 'one', 'thing', 'over-indulging', 'yourself', 'exercise', 'another.The', 'husband', 'wife', 'are', 'played', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'respectively', 'acting', 'entire', 'cast', 'fascinating', 'admit', 'pains', 'face', 'look', 'so', 'real', 'kid', 'terrified', 'expression', 'painful', 'see', 'not', 'easy', 'one', 'forget', 'sincerely', 'hope', 'were', 'really', 'acting']",N/A

Later that day, the young man, Peter (Brady Corbet), visits their house and asks Ann to borrow some eggs.  She thinks that the request is odd but acquiesces.  Another young man, Paul (Michael Pitt), arrives, and Ann senses that something is wrong.  When George and their son returns, she asks George to make the boys leave.  That's when everything starts to go wrong.  During the rest of the movie, the two boys torment the family, playing their ""funny"" mind games.""Funny Games"" is clearly different from the average horror film, in that it plays with the typical conventions of the genre.  In doing so, it prevents the audience from having the catharsis these kinds of movies usually provide, such as seeing a final victim getting revenge against the killer.  German director Michael Haneke (""Cache"") likes to play games with his audiences, and he knows the material here well, as this version is a remake of his own 1997 foreign-language film.  Although very little actual violence is shown on-screen, ""Funny Games"" is one of the most brutal and shocking movies I've seen.  Unfortunately, the mind games Peter and Paul play with the family aren't enlightening or even entertaining and pale in comparison to the mind games played with the audience.  While watching it, I was at times infuriated and irritated with the director.  I was prepared to give ""Funny Games"" only 2 stars; however, it's been over a week since I watched the movie, and it's stuck with me in a way that most horror flicks don't.  Although I didn't love the film, it's effective.",3,The games people play,1226188800,"11 9, 2008",2008,2127,"['have', 'admit', 'expected', 'something', 'different', 'Funny', 'Games', 'more', 'suspense', 'film', 'horror', 'flick', 'was', 'shocked', 'times', 'movie', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'shocked', 'regardless', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'star', 'Ann', 'George', 'wealthy', 'couple', 'visiting', 'pristine', 'lake-side', 'vacation', 'home', 'young', 'son', 'Georgie', 'When', 'arriving', 'see', 'one', 'neighbors', 'remind', 'planned', 'golf', 'game', 'next', 'day', 'neighbor', 'oddly', 'preppy-looking', 'young', 'man', 'whom', 'take', 'little', 'notice', 'Later', 'day', 'young', 'man', 'Peter', 'Brady', 'Corbet', 'house', 'Ann', 'borrow', 'eggs', 'request', 'odd', 'acquiesces', 'young', 'man', 'Paul', 'Michael', 'Pitt', 'Ann', 'something', 'wrong', 'When', 'George', 'son', 'returns', 'George', 'make', 'boys', 'leave', 'when', 'everything', 'go', 'wrong', 'rest', 'movie', 'two', 'boys', 'torment', 'family', 'playing', 'funny', 'mind', 'games', 'Funny', 'Games', 'clearly', 'different', 'average', 'horror', 'film', 'typical', 'conventions', 'genre', 'doing', 'so', 'audience', 'having', 'catharsis', 'kinds', 'movies', 'usually', 'provide', 'such', 'seeing', 'final', 'victim', 'getting', 'revenge', 'killer', 'German', 'director', 'Michael', 'Haneke', 'Cache', 'play', 'games', 'audiences', 'material', 'here', 'well', 'version', 'remake', 'own', '1997', 'foreign-language', 'film', 'very', 'little', 'actual', 'violence', 'shown', 'on-screen', 'Funny', 'Games', 'one', 'most', 'brutal', 'shocking', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Unfortunately', 'mind', 'games', 'Peter', 'Paul', 'play', 'family', 'are', ""n't"", 'enlightening', 'even', 'entertaining', 'pale', 'comparison', 'mind', 'games', 'played', 'audience', 'watching', 'was', 'times', 'infuriated', 'irritated', 'director', 'was', 'prepared', 'give', 'Funny', 'Games', 'only', '2', 'stars', 'however', 'been', 'week', 'watched', 'movie', 'stuck', 'way', 'most', 'horror', 'flicks', 'do', ""n't"", 'did', ""n't"", 'love', 'film', 'effective']",N/A

Having been blessed with ADHD sometimes it takes me a couple of times at something to remember why I had decided I did not want ever again (like homemade apple pie covered with cherries, custard & hot fudge...it looked good at the time but quite sickening...unfortunately I had to get sick twice to remember the 1st experience...). My low rating on this movie is not b/c of the quality of the movie or plot or anything. It is simply one of those movies that is so under your skin irritating that I found myself quite angry w/the 2 villains & frequently found myself looking for a golf club to want to smash their heads in, cut their heads off & rip their hearts out, burn each item in totally separate incinerators & send their ashes into different galaxies' suns in the hopes that there would be no chance ever of these 2 evil twins to resurrect ever except at judgement day to be sent eternally to hell. Now, I suppose having said all that, one might say that if the movie got to me that much, then it was good. Well, if that was the intent of the writer then I guess it would be rated high. I love sci-fi, horror, action, family, religious, etc. Maybe it is just me, & I am sure there are other films that may do the same to me or others (I haven't seen one yet...some close, very frustrating movies, but never one like this).The film itself is done well in the sense of acting, plot, etc. Maybe it reminds me too much of what I see today in our world...the cold callousness of 2 young men who either have no concept of right & wrong, or who having simply given themselves over to evil totally. This would be the face of satan...devilishly charming, with warning signs all over the place & yet b/c of their ability to disarm your 1st instincts, which come back only too late to save you, they melt themselves into the victims' homes like heated butter into bread.  Like teasing locusts they consume every bit of hope, but not before they let you think there is hope.  You find yourself saying ""this is it, they can make it..."" only to have that hope rescued by despair.  And then, off they move to the next crop of humanity.If you are an emotional sadist and/or masochist, maybe this film is for you.  There is nothing funny about this game. My hope, to be honest, is that this rating will prevent you from watching it. I have watched many excellent horror movies. And as I said, maybe to the movie purist, the very reasons that cause me to yell out ""do not turn down this alleyway"" are the exact reasons they would consider it excellent. Maybe I am an old foagy with idealistic views of hope, & that no matter how bad things get, good ALWAYS overcomes evil.  But with the advent of these 2 lads who, w/o any supernatural effects in the movie, supernaturally affect you, I find myself needing to prepare for the end of times when such evil will be rampant, as that which retrains evil is removed. And speaking of removing, I removed this movie from my collection. I think I mean to discard it to. I know. You can all think what you want. But I do not want to be a part of spreading this not-good news of evil.
