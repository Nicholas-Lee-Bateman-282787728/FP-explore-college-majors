The storyline mocking celebrityhood and how society and the media has created a monster diverting our attention from really important matters.  What was not appreciated so much was the storyline of the commoner who happens to be an amazing opera singer and has stage fright.  Woody Allen designs a plan to allow this individual the opportunity to shine in the only place he knows how....the shower.  That plan consists of recreating a shower scene onstage with full running water, shampoo, and even sponge, may have been loofah - not sure at this point.  Of course, this makes sense.

1603710,A2C27IQUH9N1Z,B00A1O0G3G,audrey,"[2, 3]","Woody Allen is so underappreciated in this country. I don't understand it. And now people who criticized him for always filming in New York are complaining that he is filming in Europe too much. Geez! Personally, I've been thoroughly enjoying the auteur's international jaunts. I think the new settings have given him a new spark, and he's found some young actors he enjoys working with. In this outing we have several storylines set in Rome. (They do not converge, which is maybe less magical, but also less contrived.) A newly married couple get separated on their first day in Rome and each has an adventure which involves sexual fidelity. Penelope Cruz looks gorgeous and there are many funny situations. In another thread, Jesse Eisenberg (playing a young Woody-like character) lives with one woman but is attracted to her friend, all the while Alec Baldwin is giving him relationship advice. This was a lot of fun. In another scenario, Woody Allen himself plays a retired opera producer who discovers his daughter's future father-in-law is a virtuoso tenor -- but only when he sings in the shower. Normally I would be nonplussed by a plot lifted from a Flintstones episode, but Allen makes it work. The fourth plotline revolves around Roberto Benigni's normal guy who is suddenly famous for no apparent reason. The story deals with how he handles fame and the loss of privacy.I enjoyed all four of these stories. I thought all the actors were great and the dialogue was very enjoyable. I also liked the way each story was resolved. I believe Woody Allen's trips to Europe have reinvigorated his storytelling, and though I enjoy all his movies, I think ""Midnight in Paris"" and ""To Rome With Love"" represent a new peak for this undervalued director. There is a saying about how no prophet is appreciated in his own country, and that certainly seems to be true for Allen, an incredible artist who writes, acts and directs in great films with remarkable regularity, but who seems to elicit mainly yawns and complaints from his fellow Americans.If you like Allen, and you enjoyed Midnight in Paris, there is a good chance you will like this movie, which also stars a beautiful city called Rome.

1603718,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,B00A1O0G3G,California Dreaming,"[1, 3]","I've been to Rome a couple of times; it's surely one of the world's greatest cities.  When in Rome, it may very well be ""do as the Romans,"" but more than that, who needs a museum?  Everything around you is a work of art.  But there are pluses and minuses, of course.  Italians are some of the pushiest people in the world, and they even have less patience than people in California.  (Italians also like riding the coattails of their own past successes, but that's a story for another day.)And I'm a big fan of Woody Allen, even though he's the latest kicking boy du jour.  I've seen almost everyone of his films, and rarely am I disappointed.  But I would say that this is surely one of his worst films; there is only one other that I've seen that I liked less.  The other was a musical from what I remember, and it was beyond forgettable.  It was so forgettable that I've forgotten its name.While I love the cinematography here -- how could you not, as most if not all of the great sights of Rome are displayed here in all their glory -- Mr. Allen just had way too many irons in the fire with this film.  There are way too many characters, way too many little plot lines, and it takes way too long to figure out who is who and what is what.  And how all of those people relate to each other, if they do.  It feels like a really bad Seinfeld episode to me, and there weren't many of those.And I have to admit, I'm just not a Jesse Eisenberg fan.  I remember him at the Academy Awards right after he played Mark Zuckerberg, and it seemed to me that Mr. Eisenberg thought that at that point, he was the smartest guy in the room.  Just like Mr. Zuckerberg.  Hey, Mr. Eisenberg only played Mr. Zuckerberg in a film, he didn't truly invade Facebook's founder's intellect as well.  Furthermore, it seemed to me that Mr. Eisenberg was the guy here who tries to take on the ""Woody Persona.""  Watch him with the little stutters and manerisms; it's actually embarrassing.  Just because you're in a Woody Allen film doesn't mean that you have to become him all of the sudden.And don't even get me started on Ellen Page.  Ouch.  While she usually does very nice work, she stinks it up here, and not in any small way.  Her performance is really off-pitch, almost like she's playing the latest rookie on ""American Idol.""  Harry Conick Jr. might just throw up his hand in the first verse, groan, run that hand through his hair, and moan, ""Next!""And while, once again, I'm a fan of Mr. Allen, he needs to drop his actor's hat.  Now.  He shouldn't be in his films anymore, unless they are very minor roles, perhaps just cameos to be funny.  While he is still a great director, I wouldn't call him much of an actor anymore.  He has seriously lost his chops in that department.""Rome wasn't built in a day,"" as they say, and this film acts as if it wants to try, what with all the ridiculous frantic behavior, and what with all of the ridiculous characters.

In this film he seems to reprise Broadway Danny Rose by being a retired music business entrepreneur.  While meeting his soon to be in laws in Rome, he discovers that the groom's father sings Paglliaci fantastically but he can only sing in the shower. So..... he puts him on stage in the shower in an opera production! This is as inspired an idea as his blind movie director in Hollywood Endings.The rest of movie is uneven with some parts being much stronger than others.While normally I might not like the Jesse Eisenberg as Woody stand-in with yet another super neurotic relationship with the non Jewish girlfriend of his dreams, this scenario is entirely saved by Alec Baldwin's being on the scene to advise him on all aspects of this unfolding relationship. Baldwin is wonderful.  Eisenberg as Woody, well he follows in a long line of Woody stand ins and he is fine at it.There are other ensemble moments which are done entirely in Italian because the characters are entirely Italian.  The most successful of these is Roberto Begnini who gets his fifteen minutes of fame and goes nuts when it is over. This is well trod ground for this actor, complete with his typical dropping his pants moment. Frankly though, I would have enjoyed these more if these plot points also had Americans in them so everyone could be speaking English.  Allen's last movie, set in Paris, would have been less successful if big chunks of it had been in the French spoken language. The Italian language segments just seem forced somehow.Woody Allen's worst movie is probably a B.  That's why this is at worst a B.

He does ok with this approach but with much less angst than Allen. He is kind of a dud. Ellen Page is completely miscast and unbelievable. She simply cannot remake herself into a destructive, narcissist. A strong performance was put in by Greta Gerwig. She gets Allen's jokes and plays them perfectly.

In this movie Allen musters the courage to skewer everything from fame as a result of reality TV, to our thirst in finding talent wherever we can - even if it is an opera singer who can only perform in the shower, to showing, a la Penn and Teller, the trick to being a successful seductress but unsuccessful human being is to know a little as you possibly can to impress as many as you can.Luis Bunuel in his films skewers the Upper Class using similar absurdities and Allen is happy to riff off of him. This film may be subtitled The Discreet Charm of the Bourgoisie Part Deux.Casting Alec Baldwin as the conscience of the young man being seduced was an excellent choice. Baldwin plays around the edges knowing his role is only part tongue-in-cheek.Oddly it is a pedestrian Italian couple who are just married and in Rome for their honeymoon who fare the best after experiencing mutually exclusive awakenings. In Allen's thought innocence is fine but experience is finer.This is a brave film. One filled with harsh comments on our culture of spectacle and fame. In past films Allen pokes fun but rarely gives it to us the kitchen sink and all. In To Rome with Love he gives us the full frontal nudity of our absurd times.Could he have done this when he was younger? I don't think so. This type of comment is reserved for the time in our lives when a lot of water has passed under the bridge. When I think of To Rome With Love I think of George Carlin and his last show It's Bad for Ya! where nothing was off limits and no words were spared. Both men were in their seventies and knew it was time to be less speculative and more blunt.Allen shows us that art from old codgers who have been around the block is sometimes the best art.",5,An Allen Masterpiece,1374451200,"07 22, 2013",2013,1861,"['Well', 'maybe', 'not', 'vein', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'sheer', 'black', 'white', 'lusciousness', 'Manhattan', 'masterpiece', 'none-the-less', 'movie', 'Allen', 'courage', 'skewer', 'everything', 'fame', 'result', 'reality', 'TV', 'thirst', 'finding', 'talent', 'can', 'even', 'opera', 'singer', 'who', 'can', 'only', 'perform', 'shower', 'showing', 'la', 'Penn', 'Teller', 'trick', 'being', 'successful', 'seductress', 'unsuccessful', 'human', 'being', 'know', 'little', 'possibly', 'can', 'impress', 'as', 'many', 'can.Luis', 'Bunuel', 'films', 'Upper', 'Class', 'using', 'similar', 'absurdities', 'Allen', 'happy', 'riff', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'subtitled', 'Discreet', 'Charm', 'Bourgoisie', 'Part', 'Deux.Casting', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'conscience', 'young', 'man', 'being', 'seduced', 'was', 'excellent', 'choice', 'Baldwin', 'edges', 'knowing', 'role', 'only', 'part', 'tongue-in-cheek.Oddly', 'pedestrian', 'Italian', 'couple', 'who', 'are', 'just', 'married', 'Rome', 'honeymoon', 'who', 'best', 'experiencing', 'mutually', 'exclusive', 'awakenings', 'Allen', 'thought', 'innocence', 'fine', 'experience', 'finer.This', 'brave', 'film', 'One', 'filled', 'harsh', 'comments', 'culture', 'spectacle', 'fame', 'past', 'films', 'Allen', 'fun', 'rarely', 'kitchen', 'sink', 'Rome', 'Love', 'full', 'frontal', 'nudity', 'absurd', 'times.Could', 'have', 'done', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'type', 'comment', 'reserved', 'time', 'lives', 'when', 'lot', 'water', 'passed', 'bridge', 'When', 'think', 'Rome', 'Love', 'think', 'George', 'Carlin', 'last', 'show', 'Bad', 'Ya', 'where', 'nothing', 'was', 'limits', 'words', 'were', 'spared', 'men', 'were', 'seventies', 'knew', 'was', 'time', 'be', 'less', 'speculative', 'more', 'blunt.Allen', 'art', 'old', 'codgers', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'block', 'sometimes', 'best', 'art']",N/A

1603725,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B00A1O0G3G,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[6, 8]","Woody Allen has had the opportunity to create films in different countries in recent years.  ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" in 2008, ""You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger"" in 2010 filmed in London, ""Midnight in Paris"" in 2011 and in 2012, in Rome for his latest comedy ""To Rome with Love"".A film in which distributors of Rome gave Allen the chance to create a film in their country and being a fan of Italian cinema and would earn over $73 million in worldwide box office sales and the seventh highest grossing film for Sony Pictures Classics.The film would feature the return of Woody Allen as director and actor (who has not appeared in a film since ""Scoop"" in 2006) and the romantic comedy would feature a total of four separate vignette.The film would feature an all-star ensemble cast starring Woody Allen, Judy Davis (""Deconstructing Harry"", ""A Passage to India"", ""Barton Fink""), Flavio Parenti (""I Am Love"", ""Tell Me About Love""), Roberto Benigni (""Life is Beautiful"", ""Pinocchio"", ""The Tiger and the Snow""), Alison Pill (""Scott Pilgrim vs. The World"", ""Midnight in Paris"", ""Milk""), Alessandro Tiberi (""Boris"", ""Generazione Mille Euro""), Alessandra Mastronardi (""I Cesaroni"", ""Romanzo criminale""), Alec Baldwin  (""Beetle Juice"", ""30 Rock""), Jesse Eisenberg (""The Social Network"", ""Zombieland"", ""Adventureland""), Greta Gerwig (""Damsels in Distress"", ""No Strings Attached"", ""Arthur""), Penelope Cruz (""Blow"", ""Vanilla Sky"", ""Volver""), Ellen Page (""Juno"", ""Inception"", ""Hard Candy"", ""X-Men: The Last Stand""), Fabio Armiliato (""Tosca"", ""Madame Butterfly"") and Carol Alt (""Private Parts"", ""Beyond Justice"").VIDEO:""To Rome with Love"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1 aspect ratio).  One thing that worked to the film's efficacy is choosing the right areas to film Rome.  No stock video footage, pretty much capturing the structure, the crowded areas and having the talent in those areas as cinematographer Darius Khondji (""Alien: Resurrection"", ""Midnight in Paris"", ""Se7en"") can capture the beautiful backdrops.  Rome has its fair share of graffiti laden areas but what Woody Allen features in film is the beautiful areas that Rome is known for and making it feel romantic.Picture quality is vibrant during those key scenes.  Wonderful detail in the various structures, great detail when it comes to closeups.  Skin tones look natural, blacks look good and deep and I saw no problems with artifacts or any softness.  The film looked gorgeous in HD!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""To Rome with Love"" is presented in English and French 5.1 DTS-HD MA with an English - Audio Descriptive Track.  The film is a romantic comedy that is primarily dialogue and music driven.  Dialogue is crystal clear through the center and front channels while the music sounds incredible in lossless.The music for the soundtrack definitely has the Italian feel of utilizing opera, popular 50&#8242;s Italian music and also a bit of modern music as well.The soundtrack kicks off with the popular Domenico Modugno 1958 hit song ""Nel Blu Dipinto Di Blu (Volare)"" which sets up the romantic mood for the film.But the next song was an interesting transition as it goes to a remake of Paolo Zavallone (aka El Pasador) and a remake of his 1978 hit ""Amada Mia, Amore Mio"" redone by The Starlite Orchestra.  While the song incorporates the disco style of music that I grew up listening to as a child (which brought back memories of listening to disco versions of Beethoven and Mozart), the song is quite fun with the deep male vocal singing ""Amada Mia, Amore Mio"".The soundtrack then transitions back to two romantic Italian instrumentals.  ""Arrivederci Roma"" by Alredo Messina and ""Ciribiribin"" by Angelo DiPippo.  And you also get a few more instrumentals including DiPippo's jazz version of ""Nel Blu Dipinto Di Blu (Volare)"" and ""Libiamo ne'lieti Calici (from ""La Traviata"").  Also, a bossna nova instrumental by Mop Mop titled ""Three Times Bossa"" and ending with Steven Bernstein's Neapolitan Orchestra's version of ""Nel Blu Dipinto Di Blu (Volare)"".  And also the inclusion of the the somewhat out of place, synth pop instrumental ""Studio 99&#8243; by Adam Hamilton.As as the film is romantic to its core with instrumentals as part of one half of the soundtrack, you also get the gifted funeral director in the shower, played by  ""the best Ch&eacute;nier of our time"", Fabio Armiliato.  A good number of opera tracks such as ""E Lucevan Le Stelle [From ""Tosca""]"", ""Nessun Dorma [From ""Turandot""]"" and opera tracks from ""Fedora"" and ""Pagliacci"" to round out the soundtrack.You do get a little of the Woody Allen style of music that fans are familiar with the inclusion of ""When Your Lover Has Gone"" by American Eddie Condon & His Orchestra and the track ""When Your Lover Has Gone"".  You also get the '40s ""Non Dimenticar Le Mie Parole"" by Emilio Livi and the Trio Lescano.A beautiful balance of Italian classic romantic tracks to operatic tracks by Fabio Armiliato, Woody Allen's ""To Rome with Love: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack"" is complimentary to his latest film but also to hopeless romantics who are passionate for Italian music. And the music really sets the pace for ""To Rome with Love"" in capturing the feeling of love.Subtitles are in English, English SDH, French, Hindi and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""To Rome with Love"" come with the following special features:Con Amore: A Passion for Rome - (9:05) Producer Letty Aronson (also younger sister of Woody Allen) discusses how ""To Rome with Love"" came to be, the hiring of the cast.  Plus interviews with the cast members.Trailer - (The theatrical trailer for ""To Rome with Love"".JUDGMENT CALL:Having read books on Woody Allen and his passion for foreign films especially Italian films, we get to see Woody Allen being a bit Fellini-esque with his latest film ""To Rome with Love"".Sexy, fun and daring... ""To Rome with Love"" is quite reminiscent of Commedia all'Italiana (comedy Italian style) and almost like it's paying homage to Federico Fellini, Mario Monicelli and Vittorio De Sica but in modernized setting and also appeasing both Western and Italian sentimentality.The first vignette featuring Woody Allen as a father who is a retired music exec trying to create the next big opera hit when he discovers his future son-in-law's father singing while taking a shower.  Woody Allen's humor is so hilarious that I could not stop laughing whenever he showed up on screen.  Allen knows how to use his character roles in the most unexpected moments and the spontaneity is wonderful but yet audacious as the character of Jerry (portrayed by Woody Allen) will go so far as to stage an opera with Giancarlo (portrayed by wonderful opera singer Fabio Armiliato) in a shower. It's very odd, but yet so satisfying that I enjoyed it.The second vignette, Antonio (portrayed by Alessandro Tiberi) and his wife Milly (portrayed by Alessandra Mastronardi) reminds me of Mario Monicelli's ""Boccaccio '70&#8243; anthology segment but yet different predicaments.  For this segment, we have two people who are married and in love and have come to accept things as they are.  But when the are thrust into the city of Rome and are separated, they have their own sexual adventure but with other people.  But can this little one day of adventure, spice things up between Antonio and Milly?  Penelope Cruz has a sexy, sultry character portrayl of Anna that reminds you of older Sophia Loren Italian films.The third vignette is what I call the Fellini-esque films. Best not to think hard about of how things happen or why things happen, they just do.For this vignette, Sally loves Jack, Jack loves Sally but finds out he also loves her friend Monica.  While it sounds quite simplistic, what makes the film a bit odd is the character of John, portrayed by Alec Baldwin.  In the beginning, we see John with his friends and going to find his old hang-out area in Rome, which he runs into a young architect, named Jack (portrayed by Jesse Eisenberg), who happens to follow John's work.  But the strange thing is that during the conversations that Jack has with the women on certain days, somehow out of nowhere, John shows up giving Jack advice.So, we start to think, is John part of Jack's conscience.  It may seem like it until, you see the female characters acknowledging John's presence.  So, does that mean that John has been staying over at Jack's place for several days and accompanying him everywhere, even when he's with Sally or Monica?  It's hard to say but it's one of those things you see in classic Italian cinema.  Things happen, but don't bother with an explanation, just enjoy!And the final vignette is about Leopoldo (portrayed by Roberto Benigni).  A man who has a ho-hum life of being an office worker and can only dream how life would be if he was popular or became ""the man"".  Well, one day, it comes true and he becomes the most famous man in Rome as paparazzi and media are always at his front door and wanting to know what he's eating, doing that part of the day.  And Leopoldo has no idea why media would follow him.  But he's become popular and he and his family are invited to Rome's celebrity events, fashion events and even top actresses and models want to sleep with him.But what happens when Leopoldo wants it all to go away?  Even his chauffeur tells him that it's best to be a celebrity than not.I suppose one can equate this to the amount of paparazzi experiences that a popular celebrity experiences during their most popular time in their lives.  They don't like the media following them, they want their privacy.  But when the media stops giving you the attention, now what?  Celebrities try to find ways to get the media interested in them once again and its an interesting conundrum. And Leopold is that perfect example.As for the Blu-ray release, ""To Rome with Love"" looks fantastic on Blu-ray.  While the first vignette is music driven, the second and third tend to emphasize the beauty of Rome of its longstanding structures and architecture, while the four vignette focuses on the glitz and glamor Rome has to offer.  The cinematography is beautiful, the picture quality is full of detail, sharp and colorful, while the lossless audio features a wonderful music soundtrack.  And as for special features, while Woody Allen is best known for not liking special features with his video releases, his last three releases have come with a featurette.  ""To Rome with Love"" comes with an interview with producer and Allen's younger sister Letty Aronson, who goes into detail of how the film came to be and the casting of the people in the film and how Woody Allen managed to do it, without even speaking a word of Italian and just knew which shot would work for the film.  The featurette also includes interviews with the cast members and you get a trailer.As for the film itself, I absolutely enjoyed ""To Rome with Love"".  The film is beautiful, the humor and stories of the vignette's featured in this film is like an homage to classic Commedia all'Italiana.An enjoyable Woody Allen film on Blu-ray.

The satire is razor sharp, and just beneath the surface humor, Allen's bitterness is evident.In my favorite segment, Roberto Benini plays an average Italian citizen, with an opinion about everything, but no one cares.  That is, until he is accidentally mistaken for a celebrity, after which he becomes ""famous for being famous"".  All of a sudden the media and the public are obsessed with every trivial detail of his life, and every utterance he makes is taken with great reverence.The other stories have their funny moments as well.  There's plenty of action, lots of plot twists to the multiple plots, and many laugh out loud moments.  This is more a collection of clever skits than a cohesive movie.

(It was great to see The Wood Man back up on the screen in his full comical glory. As it worked out, he gave himself some of the best lines in the film.)-Ellen Page. If you've seen her in stuff like Hard Candy and Juno, you know that she would fit into a Woody Allen film quite well (neurotic, eccentric, witty, delightful, edgy).-Judy Davis. She doesn't have many scenes, as Allen's wife in the film, but Allen gave her some terrific lines, and it's great to see her in an Allen film again (she was very good in Celebrity and superb in Husbands and Wives [possibly the best performance by any actress in any Allen film]).-Jesse Eisenberg. He plays the Woody Allen character in the film (i.e., he substitutes for Woody Allen). Hadn't seen him in anything since The Social Network. Just right for an Allen film: intellectual, nervous, and a bit of a kook. (I must congratulate Woody Allen. This is the third Woody Allen substitute in a row that has worked out quite well: Josh Brolin in You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger, Owen Wilson in Midnight in Paris, and Eisenberg in this film. So many other Woody Allen substitutes have been very poor, especially Jason Biggs in Anything Else and Will Ferrell in Melinda and Melinda.)-If you appreciate old Italian-made film comedies, you'll appreciate what Allen did in this movie stylistically.-Penelope Cruz in a very attractive, short red dress. Sexy as ever in her late thirties.-Traditional Italian music and current and past Italian pop music (e.g., Volare).-Alec Baldwin. There's been a lot of debate as to exactly who or what the Baldwin character is in this film. A ghost? A doppleganger? A particular type of character that has been heretofore unknown in film? Most people were very confused about the character, but I've had a lot of fun debating with people as to exactly who or what the character is.-Gorgeous Roman architecture (the ruins, etc.).-Roberto Benigni. After having seen Roberto in two Jim Jarmusch films in the late 80's and 90's (specifically, Down by Law and Night on Earth), I became a huge fan. And from that point forward, all I had to do was just look at the guy and I'd crack up. His segment in this film doesn't work (an every day, average fellow who all of a sudden finds himself a wildly popular celebrity for absolutely no reason at all), but I still laugh because...all I have to do is just look at the guy and I crack up.-The typically reliable movie critic James Berardinelli of Reelviews.net claimed that the movie is ""s***"" and named it one of the ""bottom"" 10 films of 2012. In general, I agree with him. The script, in my mind, just isn't quite there. And you can't have much of a movie if the script isn't quite there. This definitely isn't one of Allen's better efforts.

1603733,A2BPDFR58H9575,B00A1O0G3G,Galina,"[4, 4]","During Woody Allen's European vacation, he has made four stops in London, visited Barcelona, dropped for a short visit to New York City, spent one summer in Paris, and then he had Roman Holiday last summer. All the tourist attractions of the Eternal City are in full display in Allen's film and they are spectacular: the Trevi Fountain and the Spanish Steps, the Coliseum, and panoramic views of the city from above, the rain at night, and outdoor caf&eacute;s. Like in Paris' movie before that, Darius Khondji's camera finds unexpected and hidden angles of famous Rome beauty. The sound of wonderful melodic Italian songs and arias are heard everywhere -and what is Italy or Rome without music? Four different stories in which the Romans and the visitors are involved play against this joyous background of Rome glowing under summer sun. It seems that Allen created a mini Decameron. The stories do not overlap, but they have in common Rome and love in Rome to Rome.Comparison with last year Allen's film about Paris certainly arises, but as Paris and Rome are two very different cities, even though both are famous, beautiful and often serve as a background or even an important character in the movie (""Fellini's Rome,"" and ""Paris, I Love You"", for example), so the Allen's movies about Paris and Rome are quite different. The Roman film, in my opinion, lacks rare magic and brilliance of ""Midnight in Paris."" The reason seems to be in switching from one story to another, and there are, as I've mentioned, four of them. Each is funny and attractive in its own way, but as the whole they failed to produce magic. As the rule, all stories in an anthology can't be on the same level. The story of Leopoldo, for instance, had intriguing premise but then just lost some of its steam.Definite plus - for the first time in the last six years, Allen is in front of the camera as well as behind it. Allen knows a secret of physical comedy. He can simply stay in the frame, even in the background and keep silent, and his face will express a range of feelings and emotions, the predominant being a mixture of confusion and dumbfoundedness. Some might say that we've seen it all before but I don't mind. Allen is a good comedian who always makes me smile and laugh. And the same can be said of his Roman film. Allen does not do anything new here but the movie is good. For example, the idea of introducing a singer with the great voice who can only sing in the shower was original and smart. The film is funny, witty, beautiful, bright, and very light, feather-light. Its creator is 76 years but you hardly believe it when he sends us on Roman holiday.My conclusion - any Allen's movie, even average comparing to his best work, is worth watching. If you are a die-hard fan like me, you've seen it already. I've said many times before and I repeat again - even the average Woody Allen's movie is better than most cookie-cutter comedies released by big studios. If you are not a fan, give ""To Rome with Love"" a chance, you may fell in love with it. This is the first anthology by Allen for many years and I'm sure you'll like if not four by some of the stories. I am personally delighted by the story of the owner of the funeral home, who sang like Caruso and Pavarotti, but only in the shower, to the sound of pouring water while lathering his back. Or, perhaps, you'll like a surreal story of a simple Roman office employee, who one sunny day out of sudden became insanely famous and popular. Moreover, he could not figure out what actually happened and what exactly he did or did not do? Real celebrities and the crowds of the journalists all listened to his every word as the highest wisdom. Or you may click with the story of Jack, a young American architect -student, his girlfriend, and her best friend - a heart-breaker, of Jack's inner voice played by Alec Baldwin. Well, if you cannot stand Allen, I'll let you in on a secret, if you do not know by now. There is also Penelope Cruz in the role of Anna (I think Woody bowed to Anna Magnani's ""Mother Rome"" and Sophia Loren - Filomena from ""Marriage: Italian Style"") and it is impossible to take the eyes off her. Anna - is the character from the fourth story which is about newlyweds who came to Rome for a honeymoon from the small town and the cheerful confusion that occurred when the young bride stepped out of the hotel and got lost in the maze of the Rome's streets. If the presence of Cruz in her second Allen's film is still not enough for you, well, then I do not even know what to say.

No it is not brilliant comedy like ""Hannah and her Sisters"" nor movie magic like ""Midnight in Paris"" but (yes) it does have quite a lot of laughs and excellent one liners.  Woody Allen's spouse is played by Judy Davis and she delivers with excellent deadpan humor.  He tells her  ""I think I have a breakthrough, an epiphany, what would you call it?""  ""A Death Wish""...she replies.And who can't relate to the scene where an unsophisticated Italian woman gets completely lost in Rome, obtaining directions that simply cannot be followed.  And then she forgets the name of her hotel!Combining some of his methods from ""Annie Hall"" and ""Play it Again Sam"", Woody Allen does a marvelous job of deconstructing the ""conversation of dating"".  And on this point, he hits a bulls-eye.  The character played by Alec Baldwin (John) is an imaginary older version of Jesse Eisenberg (Jack) who counsels his younger self on the repercussions of getting involved with the pretty friend of his fiance played by Ellen Page (Monica).  Since Monica is interested in the theatre, Jack tries to woo her by exclaiming Monica would be perfect for the role of ""Miss Julie""  - a part involving shifting roles of sexual dominance. Alec Baldwin rolls his eyes and tells Jack he can't believe he is using ""that line"" as a hook to get into bed with Monica (the aspiring actress).  But the line works.I won't reveal the funniest moments, but they had me in stitches.  It's a fun romantic movie with four independent stories.  And a happy ending for the comic misadventures of love. The director is sensitive to urban cinematography...his photography of Rome lavishly displays some of the important tourist destinations.  Don't expect miracles, but it is more imaginative than most of the new romantic comedies coming out this year.

The rest of the cast make up little frazzled stories that each seem dispensable: a worker (Roberto Benigni) who wakes up to find himself a celebrity - for a while; an architect (Alec Baldwin) who takes a trip back to the street he lived on as a student now inhabited by a confused contemporary student (Jesse Eisenberg); a young couple on their honeymoon (Alessandro Tiberi and Alessandra Mastronardi) whose life is disrupted by a hooker (Penelope Cruz) and a movie star (Antonio Albanese); and a frustrated opera director (Woody Allen) and his wife (Judy Davis) who on a trip to Rome to meet their daughter and her fianc&eacute; (Allison Pill and Flavio Parenti) has a talent for discovering talented singers and `discovers' his future in-law (Fabio Armiliato) who sings opera arias well - but only in the shower.

1603737,A1XJWXF9LDFSL0,B00A1O0G3G,Hwang,"[1, 1]","This classic work du art surely constitutes the second greatest comedy to have been written and directed by Woody Allen and represents his funniest movie to date with belly roaring laughs and hilarity from start to finish, despite the fact that the movie features some relatively unknown Italian cast who put in superb performances in what can truly be termed a masterpiece that incorporates one of the maestro&#8217;s best screenplays that totally draws the audiences into the mesmeric world of the characters, who are both believable, well developed and endearing. After seeing this movie, I now rank Vicky Christina Barcelona as Woody&#8217;s third finest work.The story comprises of four vignettes: one of which revolves around Woody's character, who was a maverick produces of what constitutes ridiculously conceived ideas for musicals, travelling to Rome to meet with his daughter&#8217;s boyfriend, only to overhear her boyfriend&#8217;s father singing in the shower and discovering a talent which he could introduce to the world and whose career he could manage by presenting him to the opera house with the caveat that he has to perform in a shower stall before live audience given the fact that he can only sing well in the shower, giving rise to the most absurd and iconoclastic opera performance ever produced to overwhelming response and standing ovations from the crowd; the second of which documents the unexpected and somewhat absurd rise to popularity of a non-descript clerk who suddenly finds the public going gaga over every aspect of his life, to such an extent that he becomes the subject of interviews, is mobbed by crowds vying for his autograph, reporters tailing him everywhere he goes and constantly pestering him with inane questions, special attention being given to him by restaurants, and women finding themselves unaccountably attracted to him and eagerly awaiting their turn at engaging in sexual intercourse with him, only to find that his popularity and fame is forsaken when the public turns their attention to another similarly ridiculously non-descript character who works as a bus driver; the third comprising of a young Italian couple relocating to Rome and hoping to create better prospects for themselves in this new city, only to find the husband being set up for a paid sexual encounter with a prostitute while his wife finds herself being seduced by a movie star whom she adores, and, having experience these less than satisfactory experiences, deciding to return to the town from which they came; and the last revolving around the life of an architecture, who, having revisited the home of his past, stumbles across the younger version of himself, who leads him to the apartment of his past and introduces him to his girlfriend; who, having introduced him to her best friend &#8211; an unemployed actress to whom men find themselves unaccountably attracted to, deliberately and insidiously draws him into engaging in an affair with her behind her friend's back against the advice of his older self, who having the wisdom of retrospect, realizes his past mistake. The story ends with the younger architect developing plans for a future between him and his girlfriend&#8217;s best friend, and planning to break the news to his girlfriend only to find himself being dumped when she receives a call from a major studio for a major part in a Hollywood production that will see her filming in Japan and abandoning him.

1603738,A3IXZJ1L73DYTA,B00A1O0G3G,Jack E. Levic,"[2, 3]","Woody Allen seems to be churning out the films in his later years. There have been a few hits and a few misses. Unfortunately, TO ROME WITH LOVE is one of the films that misses the mark and falls flat to become one of Allen's mediocre films. Of course, one could not ask for a more magnificent cast and a gorgeous location. Who couldn't fall in love with Rome? Add in an international cast of top stars, and success is assured. Unfortunately, ambitious plans are often toppled by the weakest link and in TO ROME WITH LOVE, it is a totally flat, dead-end story.Of course, there are a lot of good things to say about TO ROME WITH LOVE but the film misses its potential on almost all levels. Allen is trying to tell 17 different stories (or it seems like 17) with an enormous cast and everyone has to have their time on screen to the detriment of the story. Beloved Italy actor/director Robert Benigni has a somewhat straight role and an everyday office worker with a wife and family. Even when he is playing it straight, Benigni is a joy to behold. His part of the story could be its own movie. Here is a simple man who, suddenly, for reasons never explained,  becomes the toast of Italy pursued by the media and famous actresses. The world is at his feet, but why? It's a fun idea until the questions revolve around what he had for breakfast or the ever popular Boxers or Briefs? It seems like he's Italy's version of KING FOR A DAY.Another potential missed is the story of the young newly-married couple from a small Italian town who are moving to Rome. The wife accidentally gets lost on her way back to the hotel. She keeps asking for and getting complicated directions and gets more and more lost. Anyone who has traveled overseas has been in this situation but is a bit funnier when a native who speaks the language is lost like a tourist. Then her husband is caught in bed with the luscious Penelope Cruz. Cruz has never been sexier and she lights up the screen. It's a comedy of errors for the innocent husband. Again, this story could be a whole movie.Allen plays his usual annoying and neurotic self with Judy Davis as his shrew of a wife. They, but Allen especially, drag this story down. Their daughter is engaged to an Italian man so the two families meet. Allen is a retired music producer who releases that his daughter's future father-in-law has a magical opera voice. But, alas, the father can only sing well in the shower...so that leads to the next part of this story. Just wait at see.Here comes another cliche story involving a love triangle. Architecture student Jack (Jesse Eisenberg) is  living in Rome with his girlfriend Sally. Sally's friend Monica (Ellen Page) has just broken up with her boyfriend and is comint to Rome to recover. No surprise that Jack and Monica suddenly find each other irresistible. Now it gets corny..The voice of reason or Jack's conscience is a famous American architect that Jack met by chance. Balwin's character is always somewhere in the scene off-camera. Now, at first he just seems to be joining them but he is always there and no one else responds to him.There is a lot of bed hopping going on in this film with married people and other partners. No one seems to have any remorse for their actions and in the end adultery seems to make each person a better husband or wife. I guess this is the message of TO ROME WITH LOVE.Several stories that are lost in the absolute beauty of Rome. Maybe Allen wanted to hire as many actors as he could. I wondered if the Italian actors, besides Benigni, are famous in Italy. The beautiful scenery does give the movie some soul as do the actors speaking in Italian.

He mixes together a disparate group of people, stirs lightly, and out comes:* Pen&eacute;lope Cruz (""Volver"") as Anna, a hard-working high-end hooker with a heart of gold.* Jesse Eisenberg (""The Social Network"") is Jack, an architectural student trying in vain to stay focused on blueprints.* Ellen Page (""Juno"") as Monica, a faithless friend with plenty of shenanigans to distort a guy's focus.* Alec Baldwin (""It's Complicated"") as John, an observer and sometimes unwelcome commentator. We are never sure when he is real....* Roberto Benigni (""Life is Beautiful"") is an ordinary office worker who unexpectedly becomes a Kardashian for 15 minutes of fame. Of course he is swamped by gorgeous women, all of whom are desperate to bed him. Yuck!* Allison Pill (""Milk"") as Hayley who miraculously meets the love of her life on her very first day in Rome.* Flavio Parenti (""I Am Love"") as Michelangelo, trying to protect his nave father from that capitalistic American, who might become his future father-in-law!* Fabio Armiliato (TV roles) as Giancarlo, who sings amazingly well in the shower. He threatens to be the next flavor of the month.... In a collection of absurd stories, his is the most absurd.* Judy Davis (""Eye of the Storm"") as Phyllis, an acerbic wife who describes her avant-garde husband with a resigned sigh, ""He's just ahead of his time.""* Woody Allen (""Scoop"") as Jerry, the angsty father who travels to Rome with his wife to meet their daughter's future in-laws. Allen has a couple of really funny lines, but this movie lasted 102 minutes.There far too many other characters to name, people who come and go, leaving very little impression except a faint hope that maybe THIS one might be the story we can relate to. No such luck....This scatter-shot script bounced around and left us feeling more than a little confused. How many days were involved? We saw one fellow turn off his alarm at least four mornings in a row, but that bride wasn't lost overnight, was she? How can an architectural student afford an extended vacation in the Mediterranean? How do some of these people support themselves? Who pays for all this? Who can see Alec Baldwin's character? Does he become invisible?In the past, I have generally viewed Woody Allen's amusing films as mildly entertaining. This one I would call an old man's fantasy, but that would be rude, so I'll just say he's out of step with today's sexual mor&eacute;s and expectations. While it's clear that he views infidelity as therapeutic, and I DO appreciate his observations about pseudo intellectuals, Reality TV and fame, it occurred to me as we exited the theater that I didn't like any of the people we had watched ...although I DID appreciate the soundtrack.

Other than being partially about Americans in Europe, the movies have nothing in common.The movie includes 4 different stories, which by convention you would expect to merge at some point; but they never do merge. They're just 4 stories that happen to be set in Rome. Woody Allen plays himself - the neurotic father of a daughter visiting in Rome; she has fallen in love with an Italian man and her parents have arrived to meet the future in-laws. Woody's character hears the future father-in-law singing opera in the shower and is amazed at his skill. He tries to get him to perform, but he can only really sing well when in the shower. A series of whacky performances ensue in which the man appears on stage singing in a shower.Another story involves a young American student (apparently a younger version of Woody Allen) who is tempted to leave his girlfriend for another neurotic would-be American actress. He struggles with his conscience, in the form of Alec Baldwin who has stumbled into the scene. These scenes are among the most entertaining in the movie.The 3rd story involves a young Italian couple visiting Rome on their honeymoon. The bride gets lost and ends up in bed with another man, and the husband has a brief interlude with Penelope Cruz. It's all rather farcical and not terribly amusing.The 4th story involves Roberto Benigni, an ordinary family man living a boring life, who is suddenly placed in the limelight of the local paparazzi for no particular reason. He is stalked and interviewed, and every corner of his life is invaded. This is only funny because of the quirky physical humor of Benigni.The 3rd and 4th stories are acted in Italian, with subtitles.None of the stories are particularly interesting or plausible, but they are played out against the backdrop of the beautiful streets and historical piazzas and monuments of Rome. The cinematography is quite beautiful and is a love story to Rome.

Maybe it was the fifth movie of the day they had to review for their boss. In any event, I own everything that Woody Allen has ever been involved with, so you can call me a fan.

In recent years, he seems to have felt that his jaded perspective would become more marketable if set in Europe, rather than Manhattan.The film starts off innocently with concurrent vignettes about 1) an American couple coming to Rome to meet their daughter's fiance and future in-laws, 2) a 50 something detecting himself in the relationship foibles of a 20 something American expatriate, 3) newlyweds out to impress the young husband's extended family and would-be employers, and 4) a Roman experiencing Andy Warhol's famed ""15 minutes of fame.""  Midway through the film, Allen shifts to his supposedly sophisticated celebration of licentiousness.  This is most apparent in the vignette about the young newlyweds who supposedly benefit from their adulteries (Has Allen ever heard of STDs?).In spite of the changed venues, there is nothing clever to celebrate in this film.",1,Allen brings his jaded perspective to the Eternal City,1358726400,"01 21, 2013",2013,1308,"['consider', 'movie', 'critiques', 'be', 'spoilers', 'please', 'read', 'further', '.Having', 'visited', 'Rome', 'several', 'months', 'ago', 'nostalgia', 'motivated', 'decision', 'give', 'film', 'try', 'addition', 'views', 'Coliseum', 'Spanish', 'Steps', 'Trevi', 'Fountain', 'incorporate', 'nice', 'scenes', 'old', 'newer', 'sections', 'Rome', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'just', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'long', 'series', 'immature', 'life', 'relationships', 'recent', 'years', 'have', 'felt', 'jaded', 'perspective', 'would', 'become', 'more', 'marketable', 'set', 'Europe', 'rather', 'Manhattan.The', 'film', 'off', 'innocently', 'concurrent', 'vignettes', '1', 'American', 'couple', 'coming', 'Rome', 'meet', 'daughter', 'fiance', 'future', 'in-laws', '2', '50', 'something', 'detecting', 'relationship', 'foibles', '20', 'something', 'American', 'expatriate', '3', 'newlyweds', 'out', 'impress', 'young', 'husband', 'extended', 'family', 'would-be', 'employers', '4', 'Roman', 'experiencing', 'Andy', 'Warhol', 'famed', '15', 'minutes', 'fame', 'Midway', 'film', 'Allen', 'supposedly', 'sophisticated', 'celebration', 'licentiousness', 'most', 'apparent', 'vignette', 'young', 'newlyweds', 'who', 'supposedly', 'benefit', 'adulteries', 'Has', 'Allen', 'ever', 'heard', 'STDs', 'spite', 'changed', 'venues', 'nothing', 'clever', 'celebrate', 'film']",N/A
1603752,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B00A1O0G3G,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[6, 11]","Last year Woody Allen released his 42nd film Midnight in Paris, which became his highest grossing film and won him a fourth Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. For many filmmakers this would be a soaring comeback and their next film would reflect a renewed sense of confidence and vigor. Despite such a consistent output, Allen looks at filmmaking as a way to keep himself busy and his 43rd film To Rome with Love (previously titled Bop Decameron and then Nero Fiddled) reflects none of his recent success. In fact, To Rome with Love is a bit of a let-down in comparison to his previous outing. Even worse, it's a bit of a let-down in general. Because he's so prolific, many of his films are unjustly brushed aside when they'd fare much better if each one were his debut. That's not the case here; To Rome with Love is a decent film, but it lacks the focus and inspiration necessary to elevate it to something greater. This is truly unfortunate considering it marks Woody Allen's return to acting after a six-year absence and continues his trek across Europe by shooting in (you guessed it) Rome.The film follows an episodic narrative, with several intercut (but not interrelated) stories set in Rome. In one, John (Alec Baldwin) takes a walk through his old stomping grounds in Rome and runs into Jack (Jesse Eisenberg), a young architect who lives with his girlfriend Sally (Greta Gerwig). Her friend Monica (Ellen Page) is coming to visit and Sally worries that Jack will fall for her. John (who may be Jack's older self) materializes at random to warn Jack about his involvement with Monica, as he ""knows how this ends."" Meanwhile, a young tourist named Hayley (Alison Pill) meets a young Roman named Michelangelo (Flavio Parenti) and the two become engaged, prompting Hayley's parents Phyllis (Judy Davis) and Jerry (Allen) to come to Rome and meet Michelangelo's parents. In another, Antonio and Milly (Alessandro Tiberi and Allesandra Mastronardi) are newlyweds who have arrived in Rome so Milly can meet his family. After she wanders off and gets lost, Anna (Pen&eacute;lope Cruz), a prostitute, mistakenly wanders into Antonio's room and must pose as Milly after his family finds them in a compromising position. Finally, Roberto Benigni plays Leopoldo, an average Roman citizen who becomes famous overnight for no reason and must deal with the perks and pratfalls of being a celebrity.Cinematographer Darius Khondji, whose visual prowess made the Paris of Midnight in Paris into a fairy-tale world, returns here and does the same for Rome. Even if Allen travels outside his New York comfort zone and makes a sub-par film, you can count on it being beautiful to look at. Allen and Khondji capture Rome in the same idealized fashion they captured Paris last year and it is unfortunate the film itself is not as inspired as the setting.All four of the vignettes that make up the film have their strengths and weaknesses, but some are much better than others. I mentioned earlier that the film's original title was Bop Decameron, a nod to Giovanni Boccaccio's 14th century book The Decameron. The stories here have no connection to those stories, but Allen has borrowed some of the tonal elements such as magical realism and absurdity. There are some very funny moments in all four, but some elements feel flat and forced; particularly Benigni's segment, which has some strong satire but becomes repetitious and ultimately collapses on itself. It's a joy to see Allen onscreen again and he provides some of the funniest moments here. Unfortunately, his role as the retired opera director who becomes obsessed with his daughter's fianc&eacute;e's father Giancarlo (Fabio Armiliato) after overhearing him singing in the shower starts strong before descending into listlessness. The sense of the absurd is palpable and there are amusing moments in that unfortunate descent (the staging of the opera where Giancarlo's inability to sing outside the shower is accommodated), but it ultimately feels like Allen had written notes on a potential story arc and threw them into the script without considering how he would wrap them up properly.The vignettes with Baldwin and Cruz are probably the strongest, with the always funny and suave Baldwin providing hilarious musings about the blossoming relationship between Eisenberg and Page. Eisenberg settles nicely into Allen's world (playing what would have been the Allen character in the 1970s) and he shares solid chemistry with both Page and Gerwig. The Cruz vignette has some great situational comedy and has one of the best scenes in the film, involving the real Milly meeting a famous actor and ending up in a hotel room with him that has been commandeered by a burglar.The dialogue is wonderful as usual and it's thoroughly a Woody Allen film. I just feel it would have benefitted from a more focused screenplay that ditched the more uninspired vignettes and played its strengths on the more well-rounded ones. Again, there are strengths in all four but I think this may have been a stronger film if the Benigni episode had been ditched entirely and the remaining three had been given more structure and focus. It's a film that I'd certainly watch again, but it's one of the most disappointing films Allen has made in years.GRADE: C",3,A Bit of a Let-Down from the Great Woody Allen,1352505600,"11 10,

It was really funny. My grandpa even liked it and he's not a fan of Woody's. Also there is a romantic theme along with the 4 stories in the movie. The movie opens with a traffic control cop, who tells you that he has the best view in the world. He then begins to tell you about (1) Hayley and her story (played by Alison Pill - Newsroom). Woody Allen plays her father. Then about newlyweds (2) Antonio and Milly story (Penelope Cruz plays a prostitute in their story). Then it's on to (3) Leopoldo (played by Roberto Benigni - Life is Beautiful) and (4) John's story (played by Alec Baldwin) (his story is a little confusing)The stories were nicely entwined. I don't think the stories ended up connecting together at any points. And I think John's stories were flashbacks (it was a little confusing at first). A sort of trip down memory lane story. I think my favorites were Leopoldo and Hayley's fianc&eacute;'s father, Giancarlo (Fabio Armiliato). Giancarlo sang opera on live stages while taking a shower! Nude. Very strange, funny and really good singing. Leopoldo was just an average man who for some unknown reason, became a Godlike celebrity.

From a distance I can appreciate them but on a gut level they are almost always a mixed bag for me. I suspect it is because I have a mixed interest in viewing dysfunctional people who are never going to change or the silliness of his humor presentation rings hollow for me. One could argue he's for an older generation but then you look at the Box Office returns and there's profit.Allen wanted to thematically focus on fame and accomplishment with this picture. (Wiki)Arguably the best of the ""love"" stories is about the character of Alec Baldwin who ""travels back in time"" to argue with his younger self (played by Jesse Eisenberg) about the female friend of his girlfriend who he became enamored with and played by Ellen Page. This was somewhat good at best.The others were fairly flat for me if not lower in presentation. Part of it might be that the humor wasn't that funny and probably tried too hard to be so (that's typically a good way to kill it).Briefly the other tales were: a female tourist meets and marries an Italian man but there is strife with the in-laws; a rustic couple come to Rome and experience allure which threatens their marriage; and a married man bored with his life suddenly becomes a celebrity.The ensemble is impressive but generally does not deliver. Besides those mentioned already they were: Judy Davis, Woody Allen (duh), Penelope Cruz and Roberto Benigni (from LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL).The budget for this picture was 17M Pounds and it yielded a bit over $73M at the Box Office.LOVE STORIES/THEMES ABOUT ROMANCE: C to C plus; HUMOR: C minus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B minus; STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: C to C plus; CINEMATOGRAPHY: B minus to B; SOUND/MUSIC: B minus; OVERALL GRADE: C plus; WHEN WATCHED: mid January 2013.",2,MY GRADE: C plus.,1360195200,"02 7, 2013",2013,1785,"['Woody', 'Allen', 'movies', 'are', 'puzzling', 'distance', 'can', 'appreciate', 'gut', 'level', 'are', 'almost', 'always', 'mixed', 'bag', 'suspect', 'have', 'mixed', 'interest', 'viewing', 'dysfunctional', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'never', 'going', 'change', 'silliness', 'humor', 'presentation', 'rings', 'hollow', 'One', 'could', 'argue', 'older', 'generation', 'then', 'look', 'Box', 'Office', 'returns', 'profit.Allen', 'wanted', 'thematically', 'focus', 'fame', 'accomplishment', 'picture', 'Wiki', 'Arguably', 'best', 'love', 'stories', 'character', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'who', 'travels', 'back', 'time', 'argue', 'younger', 'self', 'played', 'Jesse', 'Eisenberg', 'female', 'friend', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'became', 'enamored', 'played', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'was', 'somewhat', 'good', 'best.The', 'others', 'were', 'fairly', 'flat', 'not', 'lower', 'presentation', 'Part', 'might', 'be', 'humor', 'was', ""n't"", 'funny', 'probably', 'tried', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'so', 'typically', 'good', 'way', 'kill', 'other', 'tales', 'were', 'female', 'tourist', 'meets', 'marries', 'Italian', 'man', 'strife', 'in-laws', 'rustic', 'couple', 'come', 'Rome', 'experience', 'allure', 'marriage', 'married', 'man', 'bored', 'life', 'suddenly', 'celebrity.The', 'ensemble', 'impressive', 'generally', 'not', 'deliver', 'mentioned', 'already', 'were', 'Judy', 'Davis', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'duh', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'Roberto', 'Benigni', 'LIFE', 'IS', 'BEAUTIFUL', '.The', 'budget', 'picture', 'was', '17M', 'Pounds', 'yielded', 'bit', '73M', 'Box', 'Office.LOVE', 'STORIES/THEMES', 'ABOUT', 'ROMANCE', 'C', 'C', 'HUMOR', 'C', 'minus', 'CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE', 'B', 'minus', 'STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING', 'C', 'C', 'CINEMATOGRAPHY', 'B', 'minus', 'B', 'SOUND/MUSIC', 'B', 'minus', 'OVERALL', 'GRADE', 'C', 'WHEN', 'WATCHED', 'mid', 'January', '2013']",N/A

Allen also resurfaces before the camera as a musical impresario who specializes in offbeat opera productions.  He is the father of Hayley (Alison Pill, ""Goon"") who meets hunky Michelangelo (Flavio Parenti) while vacationing.  Jerry (Allen) hears Michelangelo's father, Giancarlo (Fabio Armiliata), singing in the shower and convinces him to star in an opera, but not in a conventional way.This is but one of 4 separate and unconnected stories in the film.  In another fantasy-like episode, Alec Baldwin seemingly relives a year he spent in Rome as a young man.  He squires a man (Jesse Eisenberg) who he meets while trying to find his old apartment.  Jack (Eisenberg) is living with Sally (Greta Gerwig) who is a student.  A semi-famous movie actress (Ellen Page) is a friend of Sally's and comes for a visit.  Against John's (Baldwin) warnings, Jack begins to spend time with Monica (Page) and one thing leads to another.In perhaps the most offbeat piece, Oscar winner Roberto Benigni (""Life is Beautiful"") plays an Italian everyman who suddenly finds that he is famous for no apparent reason.  He is a small time clerk in an office.  He has a wife and a couple kids.  Then one day reporters and photographers become interested in his mundane life.  Questions like ""what did you have for breakfast?"" or do you use an electric or blade when you shave?"" become regular events.  He goes on TV for interviews.  He appears at movie premiers.  Benigni is truly a comic genius.  I wish I could see more of him.Finally, there are the newlyweds in Rome for their honeymoon.  Milly (Alessandra Mastronardi) leaves the hotel to get her hair done in anticipation of an evening with Antonio's (Alessandro Tiberi) aunts and uncles who she has never met.  She gets lost and through a series of missteps gets invited to dinner by one of Italy's biggest movie stars.  In another unlikely event, Antonio gets a visit from a gorgeous hooker (Penelope Cruz) who has him mistaken for her real client.  In an amusing bit, Anna (Cruz) must play the role of Milly the new bride while having dinner with the family and then meeting a potential new employer for Antonio.If this all seem confusing and a bit much.  It is and it isn't.  Since there is no ultimate crossing of paths as do most movies like this, the film plays out easily and isn't hard to follow.  Allen certainly has his moments but some of the jokes do fall flat.  Still it's Woody Allen.  If you are a fan, go see it.

It is hard to speak to this movie.Having delved into some of the details, I am less certain that Woody is a child molester. In many other cases , mostly non-living people and artists, my approach has been to have been to separate the artist's work fro their personal failures. There is cause to believe that this is a case of an allegation that cannot be supported. That is two votes in favor of Mr Allan's movie.  Therefore:Woody Allen's To Rome with Love is lots of fun. It is traditional to judge Woody Allen movies as a kind of movie separate from all others: To Rome with Love is a fun Woody Allen movie. There are individual bits which are borrowed from earlier Woody Allen movies and there is the usual hyper nervous much younger Woody Allen stand-in. But for the first time in a while Woody Allen is not only appears as himself but in something closer to an age-appropriate role.There are several different plot lines juggled in this movie. Given the word ""love"" is in the title and the settings for all of the plots are Rome I am going to state that the overriding theme is the several types of love. Perhaps the most unusual of these love stories is conducted entirely in Italian with subtitles and has to do with the modern love of fame. This is a topic Woody Allen has taken up before and built an entire movie around but here the story is crisp, unexpected and consistently funny. Roberto Benigni as Leopoldo goes from being a self-described schmuck whose favorite phrase is ""if you ask me"" suddenly and for no reason becomes a media darling, the center of his more than 15 minutes of fame. Roberto Benigni is funny and has some wonderful lines.The next funniest subplots includes perhaps the largest collection of characters but is centered around the brilliant Italian tenor Fabio Armiliato as Giancarlo a mortician born to sing Pagliacci but only if he's in the shower. Woody Allen is a retired avant-garde opera producer will find a way to produce an Italian grand Opera starring a man taking a four hour shower.In the third storyline Alec Baldwin as John will provide a somewhat magical presence (think Woody Allen's movie; Play It Again Sam) attempting to advise three young lovers as they navigate their way into and out of a potentially disastrous triangle.If Midnight in Paris is too much of an intellectual name dropper's comedy To Rome with Love is lightweight entertainment. Both movies succeed in starring the beauty of their respective host cities. Of the two I definitely liked this one better. Some of the one-liners could've been spoken by Woody Allen all the way back to his days as a standup comic on the college circuit but they still invoke a laugh decades later. They are usually throwaway lines but they are all pure Woody Allen: ""It's incredible that the Coliseum is still standing after thousands of years. You know, Sally and I have to re-tile the bathroom every six months.""In part due to the multiple storylines and the slightly improbable twists and resolutions make this movie seem a little long. I would not want to be charged with finding specific areas to cut.

1603774,A2PPJN8OKSXMPT,B00A1O0G3G,Pippin O' Rohan,"[11, 12]","It is summer, it is hot and one of the movies a friend of long-standing and I enjoyed best was Woody Allen's trip to Barcelona a few years ago around this time. So off we went on a sweltering late afternoon in New York to see what Mr. Allen had made of his recent visit to Rome, while stopping first at a great Italian food shop on Second Avenue for some iced beverages, and in the spirit of the moment.When we finally got to Woody's 'Rome', I laughed my way through the movie with the majority of the audience, and sometimes slightly more. The viewers are first introduced to the beautiful Eternal City by the graceful signals of a traffic director who would make an aspiring ballet dancer proud. After he listens with resignation to a predictable car collision of some kind, the traffic director pauses in the middle of his job, turns to the movie audience, and proceeds with a welcoming smile to invite the viewers to witness the experiences of some couples and families in Rome in the form of four short stories.Woody Allen joins one of the vignettes, donning the costume of an elderly and anxious father from New York on a flight with his wife to meet his future Italian in-laws, and his irritated and morose comments on the plane made to his wife, a psychologist, are priceless. Call it syndromes of fear of flying, but it makes one feel that one has encountered such a passenger or two at some point in one's life. Mr. Allen is at his best, and for those of us acquainted with his views of existence in his other works, I found myself looking at certain things from his vantage point, cranky and neurotic as these may seem to other viewers of any age.There are all different types of humor to be found in Allen's 'Rome', gauged from the participants in these stories, and depending on one's nature and frame of mind, some forms of comedy will appeal to more than others. My favorite flavor, which I had never seen from Woody Allen before, was the introduction of surrealistic absurdities inserted mostly into his own story, and that of another anecdote of his in the movie, where a modest clerk becomes famous for being famous. To quote a late European playwright and dramatist: ""Logic is a very beautiful thing. As long as it is not abused'"". All to say, I was reminded at times during certain parts of the movie of the surrealist director Bu&ntilde;uel, especially when Allen pokes fun in a gentler way at all different facets of society, regardless of gender or nationality.When the movie was over, my friend and I stepped out into the warm tropical night with smiles on our faces. And, while she expressed certain reservations about Mr. Allen's latest, I reminded her that when she is not in the picture for mortal support and a phone call away, I always take Woody Allen in one pocket and Ingmar Bergman in the other when I venture out into unexplored territories.

1603775,A1FCBJNIFF4PPU,B00A1O0G3G,prairie woman,"[4, 4]","This movie of Woody Allen's is probably the most unusual approach that he's done compared to the others I've seen.  I haven't seen all of them, but for the most part there is one story line and several characters with a particular theme.  This film with an all-star cast, including Italian actors is comprised of several stories--different plots, different characters, and interesting ideas.  It's as if Woody had a lot of thoughts and couldn't decide how to make them all come together.  He just made a few stories out of them.  What he does is start out with a plot of an American woman and Italian man who meet, fall in love, and the American parents come to Rome to meet the future in-laws.  And guess who the American parents are?  Woody Allen and Judy Davis.  The Italian parents,especially the mom, speak very little English.  The father who happens to be a mortician has a great operatic voice which he only can express in the shower!  Woody, as a retired opera production manager is blown away and tries to bring the man fame.  This is the first story.We go on to a man(Alec Baldwin) who arrives with his wife and another couple.  Not interested in sight seeing he decides to explore his old neighborhood and meets Jesse Eisenberg playing a young architecture student who happens to live with an American woman who is a student.  The cute Ellen Page of Juno fame is now all grown up and throws a wrench into this mix.  She's an actress who's trying to find herself and inserts herself into the middle of the couple's relationship.  Baldwin, an architect himself projects himself into the Eisenberg character continually warning him of this little minx who isn't all she says she is.Roberto Benigni is an ordinary guy who gets up every morning to go to a mundane job, until one day he's nabbed by the paparazzi and suddenly he's famous!  Why?  He just can't figure out why a news reporter would want to interview him on a TV show and want to know what he eats for breakfast.  He is a very talented actor and this part is Italian with subtitles.  He exhibits the same kind of harried behavior and humor that he did in Life Is Beautiful.  It's funny to watch him run from a mob of people, or go to a movie premier, and try to avoid crowds.A young married couple check into a hotel.  They are from a small Italian village but with the influence of his relatives are hoping to find a better life in Rome.  But first, she must go and have her hair done.  After receiving circuitous directions she becomes lost.  Meanwhile the husband answers the door to a voluptuous woman who is there to provide a service---someone's gift to him!  Before he can get her out of there, she is already on the bed, and the relatives come into the room.  What can he do?  His wife isn't there, so he needs to have an alibi.  What happens next to him and also to his young wife is a chaotic comedy!I found this film to be absolutely delightful, but one needs to really pay attention because there's a lot going on, as well as the switching back and forth of stories.  As with a lot of Woody Allen films there aren't a lot of props.  Most of the scenes are filmed in rooms, there is the background of the Trevi Fountain, Coloseum and other Roman ruins.  I'm not sure if all of this was filmed there but Allen puts more emphasis on the actors and script than the scenery.",5,A Roman Romp!,1374192000,"07 19, 2013",2013,3351,"['movie', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'probably', 'most', 'unusual', 'approach', 'done', 'compared', 'others', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'most', 'part', 'one', 'story', 'line', 'several', 'characters', 'particular', 'theme', 'film', 'all-star', 'cast', 'including', 'Italian', 'actors', 'comprised', 'several', 'stories', 'different', 'plots', 'different', 'characters', 'interesting', 'ideas', 'Woody', 'had', 'lot', 'thoughts', 'could', ""n't"", 'decide', 'how', 'make', 'come', 'together', 'just', 'made', 'few', 'stories', 'What', 'start', 'plot', 'American', 'woman', 'Italian', 'man', 'who', 'fall', 'love', 'American', 'parents', 'come', 'Rome', 'meet', 'future', 'in-laws', 'guess', 'who', 'American', 'parents', 'are', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Judy', 'Davis', 'Italian', 'parents', 'especially', 'mom', 'speak', 'very', 'little', 'English', 'father', 'who', 'be', 'mortician', 'great', 'operatic', 'voice', 'only', 'can', 'express', 'shower', 'Woody', 'retired', 'opera', 'production', 'manager', 'blown', 'away', 'tries', 'bring', 'man', 'fame', 'first', 'story.We', 'go', 'man', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'who', 'wife', 'couple', 'Not', 'interested', 'sight', 'seeing', 'explore', 'old', 'neighborhood', 'meets', 'Jesse', 'Eisenberg', 'playing', 'young', 'architecture', 'student', 'who', 'live', 'American', 'woman', 'who', 'student', 'cute', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'Juno', 'fame', 'now', 'grown', 'up', 'wrench', 'mix', 'actress', 'who', 'trying', 'find', 'inserts', 'middle', 'couple', 'relationship', 'Baldwin', 'architect', 'projects', 'Eisenberg', 'character', 'continually', 'warning', 'little', 'minx', 'who', ""n't"", 'is.Roberto', 'Benigni', 'ordinary', 'guy', 'who', 'up', 'morning', 'go', 'mundane', 'job', 'one', 'day', 'nabbed', 'paparazzi', 'suddenly', 'famous', 'Why', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'news', 'reporter', 'would', 'want', 'interview', 'TV', 'show', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'breakfast', 'very', 'talented', 'actor', 'part', 'Italian', 'subtitles', 'same', 'kind', 'harried', 'behavior', 'humor', 'did', 'Life', 'Is', 'Beautiful', 'funny', 'watch', 'run', 'mob', 'people', 'go', 'movie', 'premier', 'try', 'avoid', 'crowds.A', 'young', 'married', 'couple', 'check', 'hotel', 'are', 'small', 'Italian', 'village', 'influence', 'relatives', 'are', 'hoping', 'find', 'better', 'life', 'Rome', 'first', 'must', 'go', 'have', 'hair', 'done', 'receiving', 'circuitous', 'directions', 'lost', 'Meanwhile', 'husband', 'door', 'voluptuous', 'woman', 'who', 'there', 'provide', 'service', '-someone', 'gift', 'can', 'get', 'already', 'bed', 'relatives', 'come', 'room', 'What', 'can', 'do', 'wife', ""n't"", 'there', 'have', 'alibi', 'What', 'next', 'also', 'young', 'wife', 'chaotic', 'comedy', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'absolutely', 'delightful', 'one', 'really', 'pay', 'attention', 'lot', 'going', 'as', 'well', 'switching', 'back', 'forth', 'stories', 'lot', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'films', 'are', ""n't"", 'lot', 'props', 'Most', 'scenes', 'are', 'filmed', 'rooms', 'background', 'Trevi', 'Fountain', 'Coloseum', 'other', 'Roman', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'filmed', 'there', 'Allen', 'more', 'emphasis', 'actors', 'script', 'scenery']",N/A

1603777,A3Q2Q5ZV2JQNM5,B00A1O0G3G,Ray H,"[0, 1]","Despite Woody Allen's late career resurgence with great films such as ""Match Point"", ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"", and ""Midnight in Paris"", ""To Rome with Love"" falls under his decent-but-forgettable tier of films. The movie continues Allen's travelogue movies, this time set in Rome. As expected, Darius Khondji's cinematography is gorgeous and shows off the city's famous locales and scenery.The film itself follows four different stories. All four stories are intercut with one another but never really connect in any way. Allen's original title for the film was ""Bop Decameron"", a reference to Boccaccio's ""The Decameron"" which told stories about life in 14th-century Italy. In that sense, ""To Rome with Love"" aims to do the same in modern Rome.In the first, Hayley (Alison Pill) falls in love with an Italian named Michelangelo (Flavio Parenti) and Hayley's parents, Jerry and Phyllis (Woody Allen and Judi Davis) soon fly into Rome to meet him and his family. Jerry discovers Michelangelo's father (Fabio Armiliato) has a beautiful operatic voice - but only when he sings in the shower. Amusing Flintstones-like plot developments ensue.The second story follows a young married Italian couple, Antonio (Alessandro Tiberi) and Milly (Alessandra Mastronardi), who move to the big city after Antonio receives a promotion. They will be going out with Antonio's aunts and uncles who will show them the city and introduce important business contacts. But Milly soon gets lost in Rome after taking an excursion to get her hair cut. Meanwhile, Antonio has an unexpected encounter with a prostitute named Anna (Penelope Cruz) who is mistaken for Milly when Antonio's family arrives. Amusement ensues.In the third story, an American architect named John (Alec Baldwin) revisits his youth in Rome, where he had lived for a year. He bumps into a young American named Jack (Jesse Eisenberg) who faces a dilemma when his girlfriend Sally's (Greta Gerwig) irresistibly sexy friend Monica (a rather miscast Ellen Page) stays for a visit. John amusingly serves as Jack's internal monologue (or perhaps John is simply revisiting scenes from his past?).In the final story, an ordinary Italian man named Leopoldo (Roberto Benigni) wakes up one morning to find that he is inexplicably famous. Hounded by reporters and paparazzi, Leopoldo must come to grips as an A-list celebrity and all the challenges and perks that come with it. Wackiness ensues.Altogether, the film is another pleasant travelogue from Allen. It never becomes anything particularly special, but it amuses for its 112 minutes and never really outstays its welcome. Overall, the cast does well. In particular, Jesse Eisenberg fits the neurotic Allen-like character like a glove. Ellen Page and Greta Gerwig would have been better served had they exchanged roles as Page is never convincing as the sensual and soulful (though ultimately vapid) type. Penelope Cruz is wonderfully sexy and gorgeous in her role. The Italian actors do good work as well, notably Tiberi doing an Italian take on Allen's characteristic physical comedy. Also, it's nice seeing Woody Allen on screen again (his first acting role since 2006's ""Scoop""). Judi Davis also makes a welcome return to Allen's films (her last film with Allen was 1998's ""Celebrity"").Anyway, to put it simply, the video is as wonderful as you'd expect from a recent Sony release, showing off Khondji's great photography imbued with Allen's characteristic slight yellow tint. I'm not much of an audiophile but have no complaints. Extras are as light as one comes to expect from Allen. There's a short 9 minute featurette that's dominated by producer Letty Aronson (also Allen's sister) which also features comments from Baldwin and red-carpet interviews with castmembers. The Blu-ray also includes the film's theatrical trailer in HD as well as an HD trailer for ""Midnight in Paris"".",3,Decent Woody Allen.

Cast of actors is great and I was very surprised to see Ellen Page who normally plays tomboys, play the ""femme fatale"" that one of the male characters falls head over heals for.I guess one of the funniest ideas in this film is the notion of a man who can sing opera with a voice of an angel only when he is in shower.

1603781,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B00A1O0G3G,RMurray847,"[42, 53]","Having been to Rome recently, and having always been a fan of Woody Allen, I approached TO ROME WITH LOVE with excitement. I hope Woody was going to continue his winning ways, because he's certainly shown recently that he is quite capable of producing some very good films (MIDNIGHT IN PARIS, VICKY CHRISTINA BARCELONA, MATCH POINT). But, he's also cranked out some pretty lazy stuff too (SCOOP, WHATEVER WORKS).TO ROME WITH LOVE teeters into the latter category, I'm afraid. It has some amusing moments, and some great shots of Rome...but it has several performances that are downright terrible, thanks primarily to the script.The film is really 4 films in one. The stories don't intertwine (in fact, they cover different lengths of time, even though scenes are interspersed), and they each have different themes or comedic styles. I'm all for a hodge-podge, but this one doesn't work.Story one features Woody Allen, Judy Davis (a favorite) and Alison Pil. Allen & Davis are a married couple, travelling to Rome to meet their daughter's fianc&eacute; and family. Allen is an opera director (!) known for his unusual approaches to famous pieces. He discovers that his soon-to-be son-in-law's father has a fantastic singing voice. But you know the idea that we all sound good in the shower? That's the problem here...the guy only sings well in the shower. But this does not stop Allen from trying to cash in. The story is actually pretty amusing, and the climactic scenes are quite hilarious. Big laughs from my wife and I. However, Allen did not give Davis great dialogue...which is a shame, because is movies like HUSBANDS AND WIVES, she delivered the most blistering performances of any Allen female character.Story two stars the often annoying Roberto Benigni. He plays an ordinary office worker who suddenly becomes famous. FOR NO REASON. Abruptly, he is thrust into the limelight, followed day and night by cameras. He (and his befuddled but eagerly accepting wife) are taken to movie premieres. He appears on talk shows. His slightest movement or utterance is reported on. Gorgeous women throw themselves at him. He is a REALITY TV STAR. Just because. Allen is clearly making a commentary here, and many of the individual scenes are funny, but the script is hardly incisive. Benigni is funny (!) and we root for his character...but the tone of this piece is also out of place with the more sit-comish style of the rest.Story three tells the story of a newlywed couple, who have come to Rome for their honeymoon and to meet the husband's rich extended family. They are ""from the country"" but look forward to making the move to the family business in the city. The wife leaves the hotel for a quick errand, and becomes hopelessly lost. Meanwhile, the husband has been confused with someone else, and a prostitute ends up at his door (Penelope Cruz, amusing but really just slumming). Circumstance forces Cruz and her reluctant client to pretend to be husband and wife, which leads to some social awkwardness as all the powerful folks in Rome recognize Cruz and are worried she's there to rat them out to their wives. The original wife embarks on adventures of her own. Will the young couple learn something and find each other again? What do you think? This story, while a bit hard to believe (the husband's half seems to take about 3 times as long as the wife's), has the tone of a modern fable and in many ways is the most successful part of the film.Finally, story four features Jesse Eisenberg and Greta Gerwig as students living abroad. They are a happy enough couple, but we're to believe they've already settled into the domestic boredom that Allen thinks all long term couples endure. Into their tranquil setting comes Ellen Page, as Gerwig's best friend. Page plays such an annoying character, she is completely unlikeable throughout (and that's a big thing to say for the usually quite charming and witty actress). Her character spouts literary nonsense all the time and yet is apparently irresistible to men. Eisenberg is smitten almost immediately, and his argues with his conscience almost incessantly. (Said conscience is played by Alec Baldwin...I won't even try to tell you how that happens). This story features the best shots of Rome...but is almost utterly unwatchable. These four fine actors are given such poor dialogue that there is NO help for them. Baldwin's impeccable comic timing does him no good with the words he's forced to say. Gerwig is wan and whiny. Eisenberg is standing in for a younger Woody Allen, and while he can pull off the Allen-esque mannerisms and inflections, it doesn't make WHAT he says any wittier or more believable. And Page, as smart and interesting as she is, just doesn't have what it takes to be this irresistible siren.So taken as a whole, TO ROME WITH LOVE is an okay Woody Allen film. If you are NOT a fan, do NOT see it. You'll be annoyed beyond belief. If you DO like Allen, I'd say go ahead, but be prepared for mid-level Allen only. I love his desire to jaunt across Europe; I just wish his visits were more consistently delightful.",3,A so-so Woody Allen effort,1352937600,"11 15, 2012",2012,5098,"['Having', 'been', 'Rome',

Yes, there were funny moments in ""To Rome With Love"", though few and far between. But some of the jokes were so predictable, you saw them coming from a mile away. The talented singer, who can only be operatic in the shower, had a punchline that was so obvious, I only sighed when it came. I was hoping it was a misdirection and that something else would happen, but no. Woody Allen does a predictably great job of playing someone who behaves just like Woody Allen, although that has always been the case. The sudden celebrity and then abandonment of Roberto Benigni's character has been explored so often in other films that the predicatable outcome was a letdown. The young newlyweds and the members of the opposite sex that they would meet also had a predictable resolution. Notice how often I am using ""predictable""? Predictable is not a good thing in comedy.The only character who was unpredictable was Alec Baldwin's. Unfortunately, this unpredicatabilty is rooted in the fact that his character is inexplicable. Is he a ghost of sorts? A psychological phantom? He is, at times, only visible to a select person or persons. At other times, he is there in full flesh for everyone to see.

More often than not I have been disappointed.  For the past decade or more, Woody has been pretentious, mostly parodying himself without much of a sense of fun.  I did enjoy this movie and have even cautiously suggested to the spouse that he might also give it a try.What I love about this movie:1.  The Roberto Benigni story line - an ordinary person becomes suddenly famous.  He and his family have to deal with it, even though it makes no sense.2.  The guy singing opera in the shower.  He is awesome, and it's a bit that could have come out of Sleeper.  It's just funny and whimsical and it works.3.  Alec Baldwin.  These days he makes a career out of parodying himself and not seeming to care whether people like him or not.  In this movie he reaches out to Jesse Eisenberg (playing the young incarnation of the old Woody Allen character) to help him through a crazy infatuation.  He does not lose his essential Alec Baldwin-ness, but he shows a little compassion, and that's nice to see.4.  Rome.  It looks great, which of course you expect from a Woody Allen postcard.  I wonder how many people have been inspired to take vacations to destinations featured in Woody's films.5.  Woody Allen's pants.What I didn't like so much:1.  The Antonio/Milly storyline.  A couple of clueless rube newlyweds get coerced into having sex with people who are not their spouses.  Not so hilarious.2.  The Monica storyline.  I love Ellen Page, and it's horrible to see her playing someone who is so shallow and basically soulless.  It's an interesting bit of casting, and there's nothing wrong with her performance (or indeed with any of the performances in this movie).  I guess her self-centeredness ultimately leads to the storyline's (kind-of) satisfying ending.  But it's painful to see good people get hurt.In our courting days, the spouse and I spent quite a few happy hours in the theatre laughing at Woody Allen movies and reliving the bits for days afterwards.  This is the first movie in ages that captures that kind of inspired lunacy.  The innocence of those early flicks is gone forever, I think.

Each story is a criticism of the entertainment industry. Likewise the total movie is a criticism in that it which incorporates an over abundance of Italian music and formulaic plots. Allen also adds his frequent themes of sex, love, death, and culture.In one tale celebrity status is spoofed as an ordinary man suddenly is famous for being famous.In another tale we see a Hollywood actress have an affair with her friend's boyfriend. This was classic Allen as Alec Baldwin plays the voice of intellect and reason within all of our heads, the one we ignore when a woman becomes a possible conquest.A third tale includes Allen himself as a retired producer with bad ideas, but has convinced himself he is simply ahead of his time.The fourth tale involves a small town woman almost seduced by a celebrity, while her husband attempts to pass off a prostitute as his wife.While the stories ran parallel, they were connected through the use of sound track and common style, as if to say, all movies about Italy are the same. I feel the film would have been better if Allen had left off that fourth story and spent more time on the other three. The episode with Ellen Page and Jesse Eisenberg with Alec Baldwin was my favorite and I wish they had stretched that one out. That was more of the old classic Woody Allen that I love.

A man trying to revisit his past in the city he grew up in. A newlywed couple having troubles during their honeymoon. A semi-retired opera producer trying to find the next big star and a man who gets what he wants, only to find out the phrase ""be careful what you wish for"" is true. There isn't much to say about this movie to convince you to watch or not watch. This is a Woody Allen movie and he has a built in audience already. On the other hand he also has a real style that turns people off and they won't watch because it is a Woody Allen movie. I thought this was OK and I am not a Allen fan at all. I really liked his last movie (Midnight In Paris) but this one was more of his older style and more quirky and I just don't like his style of humor. Also just as a heads up half the movie is in Italian with subtitles (in case that bothers you). I thought the movie is OK but definitely Woody's style of comedy. Overall, if you like Woody Allen you will like this movie, if not you may not. I give it a B-.",3,A typical Woody Allen type comedy. Four major story lines going on.

1603794,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00A1O0G3G,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 1]","Here is another postcard from Europe by Woody Allen following the critically and commercially successful ""Midnight in Paris."" ""To Rome with Love"" is a romantic comedy comprised of four unrelated vignettes set in Rome, and like any other films told in this way, you will like some threads better than others. Or you may not be impressed with any of them, because amusing as they are, these tales seem so half-baked.So here are the four stories you get: 1) a retired, ""avant-garde"" American opera director Jerry (Allen), who stages a concert for the father of his daughter's fianc&eacute; in a strangest fashion; 2) an ordinary Italian office worker Leopoldo (Roberto Benigni), who suddenly becomes a celebrity; 3) a successful American architect John (Alec Baldwin) visiting the city for the first time in 30 years, who becomes acquainted with Jack (Jesse Eisenberg), a younger version of himself; and 4) newlyweds Antonio (Alessandro Tiberi) and Milly (Alessandra Mastronardi) from the countryside, who get separated in the city, each romantically involved with someone else.Those who are familiar with Allen's work will detect some of his favorite themes here, with each story told with humor and irony. Tales of Leopoldo and John/Jack prove that Allen hasn't lost a sense of the absurd and the surreal that was seen, say, ""Oedipus Wrecks,"" Allen's segment of a 1989 anthology ""New York Stories,"" though I feel he could have developed them into something more substantial.With cameos including Ornella Muti and Riccardo Scamarcio, ""To Rome with Love"" is an amusing romantic comedy beautifully shot against the city of Rome, which I think is the real star of the movie.",3,Four Vignattes Pretty Amusing But Half-Baked,1376006400,"08 9, 2013",2013,1669,"['Here', 'postcard', 'Europe', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'following', 'critically', 'commercially', 'successful', 'Midnight', 'Paris', 'Rome', 'Love', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'comprised', 'four', 'unrelated', 'vignettes', 'set', 'Rome', 'other', 'films', 'told', 'way', 'will', 'like', 'threads', 'better', 'others', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'impressed', 'because', 'amusing', 'are', 'tales', 'seem', 'so', 'half-baked.So', 'here', 'are', 'four', 'stories', 'get', '1', 'retired', 'avant-garde', 'American', 'opera', 'director', 'Jerry', 'Allen', 'who', 'concert', 'father', 'daughter', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'strangest', 'fashion', '2', 'ordinary', 'Italian', 'office', 'worker', 'Leopoldo', 'Roberto', 'Benigni', 'who', 'suddenly', 'celebrity', '3', 'successful', 'American', 'architect', 'John', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'visiting', 'city', 'first', 'time', '30', 'years', 'who', 'acquainted', 'Jack', 'Jesse', 'Eisenberg', 'younger', 'version', '4', 'newlyweds', 'Antonio', 'Alessandro', 'Tiberi', 'Milly', 'Alessandra', 'Mastronardi', 'countryside', 'who', 'get', 'separated', 'city', 'romantically', 'involved', 'someone', 'else.Those', 'who', 'are', 'familiar', 'Allen', 'work', 'will', 'detect', 'favorite', 'themes', 'here', 'story', 'told', 'humor', 'irony', 'Tales', 'Leopoldo', 'John/Jack', 'prove', 'Allen', ""n't"", 'lost', 'sense', 'absurd', 'surreal', 'was', 'seen', 'say', 'Oedipus', 'Wrecks', 'Allen', 'segment', '1989', 'anthology', 'New', 'York', 'Stories', 'feel', 'could', 'have', 'developed', 'something', 'more', 'substantial.With', 'cameos', 'including', 'Ornella', 'Muti', 'Riccardo', 'Scamarcio', 'Rome', 'Love', 'amusing', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'city', 'Rome', 'think', 'real', 'star', 'movie']",N/A
