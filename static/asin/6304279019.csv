I think the main problem is these are original tales from Dan Curtis and not Richard Matheson adaptations. They really lack the pacing of those stories and it shows badly with random shocks here and there, too much exposition during the action (always a bad sign) and cheesy dialogue. The original was also predictable, but was atleast exciting. Here, the opening has an outrageously cranky old basterd, but nothing else except a cheesy romance and really bad looking giant rats. The second tale was a little hard to follow but was easily the best and most suspenseful. The last, a requel of the Zuni doll tale from the 1st, gets good when the doll is loose, but disappoints as it rehashes the ending almost to a tee.

The first story was ok, not even half as good as the opening in the original. It had some cheesy  graphics though. The second story, although it didn't make any sense and  came off to an extremely bad start, was by far the best and most  suspenseful segment. It was one of the few worthwhile parts of this movie.  The third segment, a sequel/remake of the story AMELIA from the original,  came off to a boring start, but once that little zuni doll came to life,  the fun started to roll. I was disappointed however, that the ending was a  complete reworking of the original story. That was lame and showed that the  filmmakers couldnt come up with anything original. it was fun to watch the  little doll run though. He's the funniest thing on earth!
