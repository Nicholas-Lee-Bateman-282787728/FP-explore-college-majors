868121,A37PV5GMP2ILJC,B0006HBZT2,Amanda Richards,"[28, 29]","Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):1. Angela Bassett stars as a single mother of 3 kids struggling to make ends meet in inner city Chicago2. A death in the family takes them to Georgia, where they meet the Browns3. A quick Rick Fox jumps into the crazy clan4. Over-the-top characters, prolonged punch lines and unnecessary family secrets lead to a predictable endingThis movie has an established talent pool of a cast, and usually they can be depended on to put the ""dis"" in dysfunctional, but this time the jokes fail to flow smoothly, wasting the comedic talents of Jenifer Lewis, David Mann and Frankie Faison.  Tyler Perry appears briefly as his most beloved character Madea, but even this feels like an afterthought in the context of the movie.Angela Bassett is out of place for this particular role, but excellent actress that she is, her character signifies hope for single mothers everywhere who may be feeling overwhelmed by the pressures of work, home and family.Some good performances make for a movie with a strong message, but unfortunately it's hard to see through all the noise and confusion.Amanda Richards, July 20, 2008",3,Caught between a crock and a star chase,1216512000,"07 20, 2008",2008,1138,"['Short', 'Attention', 'Span', 'Summary', 'SASS', ':1', 'Angela', 'Bassett', 'single', 'mother', '3', 'kids', 'struggling', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'inner', 'city', 'Chicago2', 'death', 'family', 'Georgia', 'where', 'meet', 'Browns3', 'A', 'quick', 'Rick', 'Fox', 'crazy', 'clan4', 'Over-the-top', 'characters', 'prolonged', 'punch', 'lines', 'unnecessary', 'family', 'secrets', 'lead', 'predictable', 'endingThis', 'movie', 'established', 'talent', 'pool', 'cast', 'usually', 'can', 'be', 'depended', 'put', 'dis', 'dysfunctional', 'time', 'jokes', 'fail', 'flow', 'smoothly', 'wasting', 'comedic', 'talents', 'Jenifer', 'Lewis', 'David', 'Mann', 'Frankie', 'Faison', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'briefly', 'most', 'beloved', 'character', 'Madea', 'even', 'feels', 'afterthought', 'context', 'movie.Angela', 'Bassett', 'place', 'particular', 'role', 'excellent', 'actress', 'character', 'signifies', 'hope', 'single', 'mothers', 'everywhere', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'feeling', 'overwhelmed', 'pressures', 'work', 'home', 'family.Some', 'good', 'performances', 'make', 'movie', 'strong', 'message', 'unfortunately', 'hard', 'see', 'noise', 'confusion.Amanda', 'Richards', 'July', '20', '2008']",N/A

868123,A2582KMXLK2P06,B0006HBZT2,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","I like Meet the Browns.  I think the film delivers in numerous aspects- it contains comedy at all the appropriate moments, does an amazing job focusing on the serious drama side of the storyline, and even has a few romantic and sad moments which add some nice variety to the whole emotional experience.I'd say the serious side involving the main characters (including a single mother with three kids) is the main part of the film that won me over.  Everyone else is just a side character while the main focus is on the family itself.When a single mother travels to Georgia because she receives a letter that her father recently died... well she wasn't exactly shocked.  This is because she never even knew her father.  However, it turns out later that the father plays a life-changing part in the storyline.Another major element to the storytelling is the oldest son who's an aspiring basketball star.  It turns out he's got enough potential to possibly go to the majors.  He has his own problems though, which will you soon find out about.  Does he eventually overcome them?  You have to see the movie to find out.However, the storyline does an *amazing* job showing how difficult it is for a single mother living in an apartment building and having to raise three kids by herself.  The emotions you will feel range from feeling sorry for the family, to hoping they can eventually settle down somewhere nice with enough money to make it.  The writers do a really fine job building emotion at all the appropriate moments.The comedy bits happen to be REALLY whacked-out and just plain silly, but somehow it all blends together and mixes with the serious parts just fine.  The writers of this film must be really talented to be able to blend two completely different emotions together and make it believable.I recommend everyone watch this film for a splendid example of storytelling done right.  You will be watching it from beginning to end and hoping for no interruptions.",5,quality storytelling,1268870400,"03 18, 2010",2010,1973,"['like', 'Browns', 'think', 'film', 'delivers', 'numerous', 'aspects-', 'comedy', 'appropriate', 'moments', 'amazing', 'job', 'focusing', 'serious', 'drama', 'side', 'storyline', 'even', 'few', 'romantic', 'sad', 'moments', 'add', 'nice', 'variety', 'whole', 'emotional', 'experience.I', ""'d"", 'say', 'serious', 'side', 'involving', 'main', 'characters', 'including', 'single', 'mother', 'three', 'kids', 'main', 'part', 'film', 'won', 'over', 'Everyone', 'else', 'just', 'side', 'character', 'main', 'focus', 'family', 'single', 'mother', 'travels', 'Georgia', 'letter', 'father', 'recently', 'died', 'well', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'shocked', 'never', 'even', 'knew', 'father', 'However', 'out', 'later', 'father', 'life-changing', 'part', 'storyline.Another', 'major', 'element', 'storytelling', 'oldest', 'son', 'who', 'aspiring', 'basketball', 'star', 'out', 'got', 'enough', 'potential', 'possibly', 'go', 'majors', 'own', 'problems', 'will', 'soon', 'find', 'out', 'about', 'eventually', 'overcome', 'have', 'see', 'movie', 'find', 'out.However', 'storyline', '*amazing*', 'job', 'showing', 'how', 'difficult', 'single', 'mother', 'living', 'apartment', 'building', 'having', 'raise', 'three', 'kids', 'emotions', 'will', 'feel', 'range', 'feeling', 'sorry', 'family', 'hoping', 'can', 'eventually', 'settle', 'down', 'somewhere', 'nice', 'enough', 'money', 'make', 'writers', 'do', 'really', 'fine', 'job', 'building', 'emotion', 'appropriate', 'moments.The', 'comedy', 'bits', 'happen', 'be', 'REALLY', 'whacked-out', 'just', 'plain', 'silly', 'somehow', 'together', 'mixes', 'serious', 'parts', 'just', 'fine', 'writers', 'film', 'must', 'be', 'really', 'talented', 'be', 'able', 'blend', 'two', 'completely', 'different', 'emotions', 'together', 'make', 'believable.I', 'recommend', 'everyone', 'watch', 'film', 'splendid', 'example', 'storytelling', 'done', 'right', 'will', 'be', 'watching', 'beginning', 'end', 'hoping', 'interruptions']",N/A

Being off-pink myself, I've never met another ""white"" person who has even seen one of his works, and that's quite sad because his body of feature films, this one especially, speak with equal depth and grace to people of all colors. If a heart beats behind your chest, if you've ever loved someone, and if you have a sense of humor, you'd be hard pressed to find a better series of films than Mr. Perry's to move you in unlikely ways.Now I'll grant you that Mr. Perry's films are somewhat predictable, but so are those of a hundred popular directors. And I'll grant you that they're a bit, well, corny... but I don't care. Most classics are, at least those not based on car chases and explosions.When I watch a Tyler Perry film I usually find myself thinking that the main characters behave in the end the way humans are supposed to. With love and support and positive energy. In fact, I usually wish I knew these people myself. I wish they were my neighbors.This is Angela Bassett's finest performance, by a mile, and the rest of the cast shine as they always do under Perry's direction. And as always, they and their writer/producer/director guru make you laugh, cry, feel and think all in a clever, warm-hearted package. Not an easy trick these days.Yeah, I know, it's not cool to like Tyler Perry films. Again, I don't care. They make me feel good.

868140,A3PCTD8QM1BIXI,B0006HBZT2,"Derrick Dunn ""The Realest DJ""","[4, 9]","After seeing last year's excellent Daddy's Little Girls and Why Did I Get Married I thought Tyler Perry had finally come into his own as a film maker. Granted Mr. Perry doesn't have the visual flair of Spike Lee,John Singleton or the underrated Ernest Dickerson but what he does have is heart. Sadly even an A-list actress couldn't save Meet The Browns from being a trite affair that may hugely disappoint Perry's fans. For starters Mr. Perry needs to fire the editor of this film. Maysie Hoy who edited Perry's two previous films comes of as a first timer here which is ironic because she's been doing movies since 1992 and has worked with talented directors such as Robert Altman (The Player)and Theodore Witcher (Love Jones). I counted at least three scenes which didn't transition well at all and did nothing to progress the story. As for the script it seems as Perry wrote this script on a whim; and the film was just made to cash in on his success because it lacks the heart of Daddy's Little Girls and Why Did I Get Married. As for the acting Margaret Avery who was excellent in The Color Purple & the recent Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins gives a paper thin performance as does Lamman Rucker who was excellent in Why Did I Get Married. As for Angela Bassest she's good as always and plays the mother role very well, I'm anxious to see what she bring Notorious next year. I would say two of the strongest performances in the film come from Lance Gross as Angela's son and much to my surprise Rick Fox as her would be suitor. The big question though is how well does David Mann's Leroy Brown translate to film ? In my opinion not as well as Madea and some of his jokes seemed forced and unneeded. As for the big screen return of Madea it's unwelcome at best and she hasn't been missed. Tyler Perry has the potential to be one of the strongest black filmmaker in Hollywood, he knows a good story, has a knack for finding talent hence Lammon Rucker and Lance Goss who will both go on to do great things. But with his latest Perry sticks to a formula that he successfully broke out with two back to back winning film released last year.

I watched it all the way through, without stopping, and left uninspired. Geez, where do i start?Well for one thing, What accent was Ms. Bassett going for? It came off different and more uncomfortable every time she opened her mouth but I will give it to her that she has that ""fire"" that I love in her acting.The bi-polar spanish woman was completely unnecesarry; if she wasn't in the movie, you wouldn't even notice that's how insignificant she was.There wasn't a medium in the movie, the characters and the story didn't mesh well for me; you had characters that were too over the top (Leroy Brown) and characters that were too calm. The story went from typical drama to comedy to sorry and sad to melodramatic to happy without any seguing.I think they threw some of these characters in just to say ""we got a little bit of this and that"" without any base to them. Was it me or did they just go through Rick's gambling problem in less than 10 minutes?Overall, the story was too typical and safe for what I expect. At least ""Daddy's Little Girls"" had an arc and characters to keep your interest.Ms. Lewis was on her game, as always and to no surprise and those outtakes were off the hook; ""Take the money Anna Mae"" LOL.

I did not find the script as predictable-for example, the son's accident and whether or not she would remain or return to ATL and Chi-town.I think the characters portrayed a more believable, realistic viewpoint to relationships and people, indicating that life is not always a ""happily ever after fairy tale ending"", but that every relationship has issues, challenges,obstacles, and flaws. If this movie were a case study example, one would ponder and realize, that the future relationship/lives of the characters in this movie (and the other Tyler Perry movies) will require adjustments, possible setbacks, compromises, and definitely diligence and hard work to continue to be successful.Considering all the negative things on tv and the ""bad"" news we hear and read about throughout the day, I find it refreshing to watch a movie such as ""Tyle Perry's Meet The Brown's"".",4,MEET THE BROWN'S THE MOVIE,1218499200,"08 12, 2008",2008,1451,"['was', 'impressed', 'yet', 'movie', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'found', 'Angela', 'Bassett', 'believable', 'know', 'many', 'women', 'who', 'lived', ""'hood"", 'did', 'not', 'necessarily', 'sound', 'are', 'there', 'worked', 'way', 'Angela', 'Bassett', 'single-woman', 'who', 'everyone', 'else', 'world', 'not', 'perfect', 'struggling', 'maintain', 'family.There', 'were', 'parts', 'movie', 'were', 'top', 'not', 'realistic', 'bus', 'scene', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'lasted', 'long', 'reality', 'Chi-town', 'NY', 'view', 'movie-not', 'documentary', 'thought', 'was', 'funny', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'script', 'predictable-for', 'example', 'son', 'accident', 'not', 'would', 'remain', 'return', 'ATL', 'Chi-town.I', 'think', 'characters', 'portrayed', 'more', 'believable', 'realistic', 'viewpoint', 'relationships', 'people', 'indicating', 'life', 'not', 'always', 'happily', 'ever', 'fairy', 'tale', 'ending', 'relationship', 'issues', 'challenges', 'obstacles', 'flaws', 'movie', 'were', 'case', 'study', 'example', 'one', 'would', 'ponder', 'realize', 'future', 'relationship/lives', 'characters', 'movie', 'other', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'movies', 'will', 'require', 'adjustments', 'possible', 'setbacks', 'compromises', 'definitely', 'diligence', 'hard', 'work', 'continue', 'be', 'successful.Considering', 'negative', 'things', 'tv', 'bad', 'news', 'hear', 'read', 'day', 'find', 'refreshing', 'watch', 'movie', 'such', 'Tyle', 'Perry', 'Meet', 'Brown']",N/A

His movies always have a positive message and often are very humorous.This story starts out with Brenda ( Angela Bassett ), a single mom struggling to make ends meet and raise her 3 kids.  None of the 3 kids fathers are in the picture ( even though she has tried to get child support during recent hard times from her son's father ).  While riding the bus to work, Brenda reads a letter she receives, telling her that her father has passed away. Included in the letter was bus tickets to Georgia for her father's funeral--a father she didn't have any contact with throughout her childhood.When Brenda gets to work, she finds that her company has been sold to Mexico and she is currently without a job.  Bills are tight and her electricity gets turned off.  Her teenage son is a wonderful young man and a great basketball player.  His coach asks a scout to come to one of his games to scope him out and see his potential, which he ready does.  The scout eventually goes to Brenda's apartment, thinking she is her son's sister ( she's Angela Bassett and is gorgeous ya know ) rather than his mom.  Brenda tells him she doesn't have time for his nonsence--men have ALWAYS disappointed her in the past and her trust level is real low.After Brenda looses her job, she decides to go to Georgia and visit/meet her previously unknown family. There she meets a group of excentric/lovable people that welcome her with open arms.  Also there, Harry ( Rick Fox ) the scout who was checking out her son's basketball potential.  He's a friend of the family and is attracted to Brenda on sight and will do whatever he can to help her.As with all Tyler Perry movies, things get worked out in the end--one of the things I LOVE about his movies.  The road to the end may be muddled and confusing, but if you follow the Lord's way, all things work out.  Yes, Tyler mentions God and prayer in every movie I have seen of his.  He seems like a man of faith and his movies reflect his love of the Lord.The only, ""bad"" things I can think of with this movie are the Leroy Brown character ( David Mann ) and her half sister Vera ( Jenifer Lewis ).  They were a little too over-the-top, and their voices got on my nerves a bit.  Plus, there was only a wee part for my fav Tyler Perry character-Madea--and she was doing an, ""O.J."" and being chased by a bunch of police cars.

868172,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0006HBZT2,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 0]","""Tyler Perry's Meet the Browns"" starts off well enough with Angela Bassett playing a strong-willed single mother struggling to raise her three children amidst poverty and unemployment on the South Side of Chicago.  But the movie quickly goes off the rails when Brenda receives a letter from a distant relative in Georgia informing her that her father - who was never a part of her life to begin with - has just died.  With nothing left to lose, Brenda packs up the family and heads on down to the funeral to pay her respects to a man she`s never met.  While there she is introduced to the ""crazy"" Brown clan, a collection of broad comic stereotypes that even vaudeville would have rejected as too over-the-top.  As to the film itself, any hint of authenticity is instantly crushed under the weight of lowbrow buffoonery, heavy-handed plot mechanics and a fairy tale view of the real world.Although he clearly means well, as a dramatist, Perry has never seen a shade of gray he couldn't reduce to simplistic black-and-white or a plot point he couldn`t milk for all its melodramatic worth.  All the men in the film, for instance, are either clowns, scumbags or knights-in-shining-armor, nothing in between.  The gun shy Brenda - who has been hurt by so many men in the past that she finds it next to impossible to trust one ever again - has a certain depth to her character, but virtually everyone else becomes essentially a walking mouthpiece for what's right and wrong in the African-American community.  And that simply doesn't make for very compelling drama.Of the actors, Bassett is nicely restrained and understated as always, and Lance Gross exhibits some genuine talent as Brenda's principled teenage son, but David Mann, Jenifer Lewis, Sofia Vergara, and even Perry himself, in a pointless cameo appearance as both Medea and Uncle Joe, are allowed to spin so out of control in their various shticks that they turn whole sections of the movie into little more than a circus freak show.Noble intentions notwithstanding, ""Meet the Browns"" is a true ""drag"" of a romantic comedy - in the most negative sense of that term.",2,unsophisticated comedy,1248048000,"07 20, 2009",2009,2123,"['Tyler', 'Perry', 'Meet', 'Browns', 'off', 'well', 'enough', 'Angela', 'Bassett', 'playing', 'strong-willed', 'single', 'mother', 'struggling', 'raise', 'three', 'children', 'amidst', 'poverty', 'unemployment', 'South', 'Side', 'Chicago', 'movie', 'quickly', 'rails', 'when', 'Brenda', 'letter', 'distant', 'relative', 'Georgia', 'informing', 'father', 'who', 'was', 'never', 'part', 'life', 'begin', 'just', 'died', 'nothing', 'left', 'lose', 'Brenda', 'up', 'family', 'heads', 'funeral', 'pay', 'respects', 'man', 's', 'never', 'met', 'introduced', 'crazy', 'Brown', 'clan', 'collection', 'broad', 'comic', 'stereotypes', 'even', 'vaudeville', 'would', 'have', 'rejected', 'too', 'over-the-top', 'film', 'hint', 'authenticity', 'instantly', 'crushed', 'weight', 'lowbrow', 'buffoonery', 'heavy-handed', 'plot', 'mechanics', 'fairy', 'tale', 'view', 'real', 'world.Although', 'clearly', 'well', 'dramatist', 'Perry', 'never', 'seen', 'shade', 'gray', 'could', ""n't"", 'reduce', 'simplistic', 'black-and-white', 'plot', 'point', 't', 'milk', 'melodramatic', 'worth', 'men', 'film', 'instance', 'are', 'clowns', 'scumbags', 'knights-in-shining-armor', 'nothing', 'gun', 'shy', 'Brenda', 'who', 'been', 'hurt', 'so', 'many', 'men', 'past', 'next', 'impossible', 'trust', 'one', 'ever', 'again', 'certain', 'depth', 'character', 'virtually', 'everyone', 'else', 'essentially', 'walking', 'mouthpiece', 'what', 'right', 'wrong', 'African-American', 'community', 'simply', ""n't"", 'make', 'very', 'compelling', 'drama.Of', 'actors', 'Bassett', 'nicely', 'restrained', 'understated', 'always', 'Lance', 'Gross', 'genuine', 'talent', 'Brenda', 'principled', 'teenage', 'son', 'David', 'Mann', 'Jenifer', 'Lewis', 'Sofia', 'Vergara', 'even', 'Perry', 'pointless', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'Medea', 'Uncle', 'Joe', 'are', 'allowed', 'spin', 'so', 'control', 'various', 'shticks', 'turn', 'whole', 'sections', 'movie', 'little', 'more', 'circus', 'freak', 'show.Noble', 'intentions', 'notwithstanding', 'Meet', 'Browns', 'true', 'drag', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'most', 'negative', 'sense', 'term']",N/A

I liked Diary, loved Family Reunion and Why Did I Get Married. I didn't care for Daddy's Little Girls nor this movie. It wasn't horrible...I just know he can do so much better.*** The movie seemed too rushed/hasty and there were some parts that just did not go together. I am still confused how Brenda was able to bring all of her children on limited tickets with her down South. Did I miss it? At the theatre, I had to fill in the blanks myself.*** I wanted to see more of the Browns. I thought this movie was going to actually be like Meet the Browns the play (which I LOVE) but where were Will and Kim? Sara and LB and Millie? I mean, I know they (I love Avery, lol) and LB were in it but their roles could have been bigger. This was just like What's Done in the Dark...even down to the ""Brenda, I make 25/hr,"" and ""I told you to get an abortion,""...Needless to say, I was disappointed.*** For a struggling mother, Angela's hair was always on point! I love Angela Bassett though. She is an excellent actress who plays this role well but could have been better with more support. Angela speaking slang, however, was a little difficult for me because I don't speak slang and I am a black woman. Plus, Angela speaking slang is just weird. Did she have to? So, is it not possible/believable?? (these are actual questions)*** I did not like Rick Fox in this role. I don't know why. Maybe the theatre I was in messed up the audio levels but he seemed to talk too soft and low and his grin annoyed me, lol.*** Sofia Vergara was too extra. I also know she can be better. Plus, I think Mr. Perry should have done more research on bipolar disorder to hit her character just right. I have first hand experience with the disorder and if you go off your meds, holding down a job and retaining friends is next to impossible. Perhaps she is type 2??*** I didn't like the pimp/ho joke.

868176,A2C5VLIJMDPWHI,B0006HBZT2,"Shamontiel L. Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[5, 8]","This movie was the typical story of a single mother who was raising several children all by different fathers (three for three), the fathers were nowhere around, and a relative died leaving her something she didn't know about. She goes to Georgia to meet a family she never knew, and a mysterious man shows up who is attracted to her and her son's gift at basketball.Cons: 1) I respect Tyler Perry's heart and drive, but I'm starting to agree with the critics who say his plots are predictable and the same. From the beginning of the movie until the end, I could've pretty much told you exactly what was going to happen, minus the background of Harry (played by Rick Fox).2) I always grin when I see movies set in my hometown, and the Buckingham Fountain and el scene at the beginning had me grinning from ear to ear. However, you will NEVER find a CTA bus driver who would let a passenger hold up a bus or a busload of people who will sit there peacefully. Chicago does not play that type of foolishness. Cheryl (played by Sofia Vergara) would've landed on her butt from a passenger or had the police called on her in about 20 seconds, so that whole scene threw me completely off. It was extremely obvious that Perry hasn't been to Chicago enough. The bus drivers are as crazy as the cab drivers!3) I will never knock someone's vernacular, and I know Perry was going for a downhome feel, but Angela Bassett trying to speak in broken English sounded so forced. I love everything Bassett is in, but her whole character was awkward. She is an excellent actress, however, everything she did in this movie was too extra. She laughed too loud. Her slang sounded practiced. Her attitude was too stereotypical. I think the problem is that it's hard for me to believe her character is this young, struggling mother who has lived a rough life. Bassett is so elegant and classy, so when she tries to sound more like she's from the hood, it doesn't quite work. I don't know her background, but everything about Bassett (for me) screams corporate working woman role.4) ""Daddy was a pimp"" That ho scene was stupid and should've been cut. After the first couple names were called, the joke was beaten into the ground.5) Cheryl's character was annoying. I hung out with so many Latinos in high school and a good buddy of mine is Latina, and I have yet to meet anybody who fits this stereotype of Latina women. She was too loud, too violent, just way too extra. I wanted her to go sit down somewhere from the beginning of the movie. She played her role well, but I wish Perry hadn't've written her in as such a big stereotype.Pros: That aside, this movie was as hilarious as all the others.1) Although Madea wasn't necessary for the plot, I just love to see her act a fool, and it was a pleasant surprise to see the dirty old man that Perry also plays. Those two crack me up everytime.2) Ghonorrea-ologist: I'm laughing while I type that. David Mann's character, Leroy Brown, is a nutcase, and I love him. Every time he was in a scene, I had to cover my mouth with my coat from laughing so loud at his outfits. Oh, they were just awful, and I loved every minute of it. I hope he doesn't dress like that in real life. And that toupee made my stomach hurt. I was just waiting for it to fly off. He was the ideal character to play his role.3) Lance Gross as ""Michael"": I have a borderline groupie crush on Lance, as well as Tyrese. Both are chocolate, tall, sexy as all hell, and have the brightest most gorgeous smiles ever on a man. Any time Perry sticks him in a movie, I'm going to see it. I'm not even remotely impressed by the melodramatic TBS show Perry has out now, but I watch it just to see Lance. On top of that, he was a really powerful character during the tough ""decision"" scene, could play a teenager well even though I know he's my age (7/8/1981).4) There was some phenomenal acting from other actors like Rick Fox (Harry); Frankie Faison (L.B.); Lamman Rucker from ""Why Did I Get Married?"" (Will); and Kristopher Lofton (Calvin).5) Jenifer Lewis: Straight-up nutcase--Nobody plays the drunk aunt quite like she does. She was another person besides David Mann who made me cry with laughter, but she steals the scene in almost every single movie I've seen her in. Her comedic timing is wonderful!I could point out funny parts all day long, but that's basically what made me like the movie. The jokes were endless, and I would've loved being on the set. But the plot was something I've seen and heard so many times that I wonder when is Perry going to brainstorm on something original.",3,Melodramatic But Excellent Comedy,1206144000,"03 22,

868177,A38S8RD8XOXLVS,B0006HBZT2,"SHAWN JAMES ""Amateur Film critic""","[0, 0]","Tyler Perry's Meet the Browns is actually a loose adaptation of his stage play ""What's Done in the Dark. The movie makes some deviations from the stage play but those deviations capture the spirit and the heart of the stage play it's based on.Brenda is a single Mom in Chicago struggling to take care of her three kids. She's sent tickets to come to her father's funeral in Georgia; a man she's never known. She's on her way to work with her friend when she finds out the factory has been sold and moved to Mexico. When her lights are turned off and desperate she gets on the bus and goes to Georgia to meet the rest of the Brown family. From there- I'm not going to get into the plot too much and spoil the movie for those who haven't seen it. THIS MOVIE IS TOO GOOD TO SPOIL.I really enjoyed this film. Some people call this the weakest of the Tyler Perry movies; I disagree with them. This film is a major turning point for Tyler Perry on a technical level. He has come into his own craft as a film director; able to tell his stories with a camera more effectively than in previous films. Meet the Browns is tighter and more cohesive than his earlier films; the story flows from the first frame to the last. The cinematography is beautiful capturing the grittiness of Chicago's inner-city streets and contrasting them with the serenity of Georgia's woods and suburbs. There are some amazing shots in this film that really tell the story beautifully. This movie felt REAL to me.I also think a lot of people have issues with this movie due to the screenplay, because they were expecting a laugh out loud comedy like Perry's previous films. Meet The Browns is a bit darker in tone and more dramatic than previous Tyler Perry films. This probably happened when Perry was adapting What's Done in the Dark to film. As an amateur screenwriter I I understand from experience he had make a lot of modifications to the story to allow for pacing, direction and character development onscreen. But Perry keeps the heart and soul of his story alive among all the changes and that's the mark of a solid writer.The acting in this movie is solid. Tyler Perry has assembled a first-rate cast of actors and they disappear seamlessly into their roles. Angela Bassett gives a strong performance as Brenda. She captures the tension and anxieties of a single mother beautifully. Her performance reminds me of Dihann Carroll in Claudine. Sofia Vegarra is a delight to watch as Brenda's friend Cheryl; she really captured the essence of a neighborhood Latina. Irma P. Hall gives a realistic performance as Mildred the daycare owner; I knew ladies who worked these jobs and her performance was perfect. Frankie Faison and Margaret Avery are strong as L.B. and Sarah; I just wish they gave them more screen time because they're both a veteran actors I never see enough of onscreen. Jennifer Lewis is strong comic relief. David Mann and Tamela Mann are scene stealers, reprising their hilarious characters from the stage play. Rick Fox- well he does the best he can as Harry the love interest. He's the weakest link in this movieTyler Perry's Meet the Browns is an essential for Tyler Perry film collectors and Black Movie fans. I recommend you pick this one up along With Dihann Carroll's classic Claudine.",5,A solid film.

Angela Bassett is seriously miscast as a single mother with 3 children by 3 different fathers living in the projects. Not to mention her character was a definite stereotype. Why did the children have to all have DIFFERENT fathers? Lance Gross at 30 yrs old, is also miscast as a high school student. What little time he spent onscreen playing basketball didn't make him believable as a future NBA basketball player. Rick Foxx was obviously hired for his looks and not his acting ability. David Mann again plays Mr. Brown and is as annoying as usual. How many times can Tyler Perry showcase this character before people get tired of seeing him? Watching him and his real life wife Tamela Mann play father and daughter onscreen always creeps me out. Talk about weird casting! The part where Madea shows up seems a bit contrived and adds absolutely nothing to the plot. The best characters in the entire movie are Jennifer Lewis, Frankie Faison and Sofia Vergara. Although they are also stereotypes, at least they do provide some comic relief to an otherwise predictable movie.Tyler Perry is good at what he does, which is make people laugh. But his characters are far too one-dimensional and stereotypical. His plots are both redundant and predictable. Sometimes it makes me wish despite all the money he's earned, he'd enroll in a screenwriting class. I honestly believe it would help when it comes to developing realistic and better developed characters, plots and storylines.",3,Could Have Been Better,1314662400,"08 30, 2011",2011,1557,"['wanted', 'like', 'movie', 'be', 'honest', 'liked', 'parts', 'not', 'others', 'Angela', 'Bassett', 'seriously', 'miscast', 'single', 'mother', '3', 'children', '3', 'different', 'fathers', 'living', 'projects', 'Not', 'mention', 'character', 'was', 'definite', 'stereotype', 'Why', 'did', 'children', 'have', 'have', 'DIFFERENT', 'fathers', 'Lance', 'Gross', '30', 'yrs', 'old', 'also', 'miscast', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'What', 'little', 'time', 'spent', 'onscreen', 'playing', 'basketball', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'believable', 'future', 'NBA', 'basketball', 'player', 'Rick', 'Foxx', 'was', 'obviously', 'hired', 'looks', 'not', 'acting', 'ability', 'David', 'Mann', 'again', 'Mr.', 'Brown', 'as', 'annoying', 'usual', 'How', 'many', 'times', 'can', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'showcase', 'character', 'people', 'get', 'tired', 'seeing', 'Watching', 'real', 'life', 'wife', 'Tamela', 'Mann', 'play', 'father', 'daughter', 'onscreen', 'always', 'creeps', 'out', 'Talk', 'weird', 'casting', 'part', 'where', 'Madea', 'up', 'bit', 'contrived', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'plot', 'best', 'characters', 'entire', 'movie', 'are', 'Jennifer', 'Lewis', 'Frankie', 'Faison', 'Sofia', 'Vergara', 'are', 'also', 'stereotypes', 'least', 'do', 'provide', 'comic', 'relief', 'otherwise', 'predictable', 'movie.Tyler', 'Perry', 'good', 'what', 'make', 'people', 'characters', 'are', 'far', 'too', 'one-dimensional', 'stereotypical', 'plots', 'are', 'redundant', 'predictable', 'wish', 'money', 'earned', ""'d"", 'enroll', 'screenwriting', 'class', 'honestly', 'believe', 'would', 'help', 'when', 'developing', 'realistic', 'better', 'developed', 'characters', 'plots', 'storylines']",N/A
868185,A3I9VSHAVCCAUW,B0006HBZT2,V. S. 3,"[0, 0]","It was great seeing Angela Bassett in the same movie with two other actresses that played her mother in other film productions; Jennifer Lewis in ""What's Love got to do with it""... Margaret Avery in the T.V. Mini Series ""The Jacksons an American Family Dream"".  It was also great to see Jennifer Lewis and Lamman Rucker who both played in the T.V. Mini Series ""The Temptations"", work together again.  For the rest of the cast and Tyler Perry; a stage play would have been better than the movie.  That would have eliminated all of the ""extras"" that the movie messed up.  I don't believe Mr. Perry can bring an original idea to the table, because he is driven by an old ""hook"" of the Cross Dressing Gender Bending phenom. There is nothing new about his philosophy, because it has been going on from the beginning of time.  After all of the Hollywood stars came out of the closet several years ago, the idea of Cross Dressing entertainment has been glamorized in the media and screen, to the point that the Cross Dressers are doing their thing with acceptance and recognition.  The sum of it all is, to each his own.",2,Something old and nothing new,1216080000,"07 15, 2008",2008,1113,"['was', 'great', 'seeing', 'Angela', 'Bassett', 'same', 'movie', 'two', 'other', 'actresses', 'played', 'mother', 'other', 'film', 'productions', 'Jennifer', 'Lewis', 'What', 'Love', 'got', 'do', 'Margaret', 'Avery', 'T.V', 'Mini', 'Series', 'Jacksons', 'American', 'Family', 'Dream', 'was', 'also', 'great', 'see', 'Jennifer', 'Lewis', 'Lamman', 'Rucker', 'who', 'played', 'T.V', 'Mini', 'Series', 'Temptations', 'work', 'together', 'again', 'rest', 'cast', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'stage', 'play', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'eliminated', 'extras', 'movie', 'messed', 'up', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Mr.', 'Perry', 'can', 'bring', 'original', 'idea', 'table', 'driven', 'old', 'hook', 'Cross', 'Dressing', 'Gender', 'Bending', 'phenom', 'nothing', 'new', 'philosophy', 'been', 'going', 'beginning', 'time', 'Hollywood', 'stars', 'came', 'closet', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'idea', 'Cross', 'Dressing', 'entertainment', 'been', 'glamorized', 'media', 'screen', 'point', 'Cross', 'Dressers', 'are', 'doing', 'thing', 'acceptance', 'recognition', 'sum', 'own']",N/A
