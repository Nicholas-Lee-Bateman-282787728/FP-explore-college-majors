My favorite part was when there was no money at Christmas and dad (Billy Ray) had the great idea of cutting out ""wishes"" from the catalog and gaily wrapping them in boxes with bows. The children accepted his gifts, knowing there was no money for the real thing. The black young man in the movie ran with the idea and when he became a famous author came back to have Christmas with this family, who had taken him in when his grandmother died and left him an orphan. His surprise was that he fullfilled the catalog wishes with the real thing!  This was a movie that brings tears to the eyes and urges you to do better in relationships. This is a great movie to watch with your kids and talk about the issue of racism.  It certainly is a step toward eradicating it.  I told a white friend of mine who has two black children she has adopted - ""I don't see them as black children.  They are just your children!""  I really do see it that way.

He performs and wrote ""We'll Get By Somehow"" the theme song for ""Christmas in Canaan"" in which he plays the widower dad, Daniel Burton. His oldest, DJ (young: Zak Ludwig; teen: Jacob Blair) is played well by both actors. DJ makes friends with a black boy Rodney (youth: Jaishon Fisher; older: Matt Ward) after saving a pup shot with a gun. At that point the story jumps ahead 7 years. Both the Burton family and the black, Freeman family are poor, living in Canaan, TX, in the 1960, complete with Afro-hair, and bell bottoms.There is a combined plot/theme of racism and overcoming bigotry, the black vote, and family in this Texas Western which includes beater pick-ups, not horses. Only one gun shot but several heart-touching scenes. A Black Vote meeting ends in tragedy. The children lead the way to promise and HOPE in Canaan, TX. One line says; ""Once your family, you always got a place"", and this DVD's always got a place in our Christmas DVD collection. Five stars from me and also from my wife. We're thinking of ordering more for Christmas gifts.Story is based on a book written by Kenny Rogers and Donald Davenport. Davenport also wrote the teleplay.

My children have no idea that there is a difference or that at a time, people were treated differently. They were confused as to why people would try to burn down a building, or dislike people.
