This included Columbo, Macmillan and Wife and others that were not as successful. All these shows have one important theme, cases are solved in an unorthodox manner. McCloud (Dennis Weaver) is a marshall from New Mexico and he was asked to join the NYPD to observe and share investigation techniques. It turns out the most of the cases are solved using his techniques, much to the frustration of the captain (J D Cannon) he is working with. One of his trademarks is to ride a horse to get across the city when he feels a car is impractical. Video quality is very good, the episodes look pretty intact, although I am not a great McCloud fan the plots are pretty exciting. Still like Columbo better. This disk has a bonus episode from  MacMillan and Wife. Universal always likes to put previews on Disk 1, but at least you can easily skip them by pushing menu on your DVD remote control. For the price it is a good value. This set is easy to use because Universal did split the disk sets by season and placed them in their own jacket.",4,Good Value!

Columbo, McCloud, McMillian and Wife were the staples. After its successful openning it spawn Quincy and later Hec Ramsey (a Western mystery series which was the last series Richard Boone did for TV and not available yet on DVD!). This also spawned a Wednesday mystery wheel which didnt fare as good.McCloud took his cue from Clint Eastwood's Coogan Bluff (1968).Eastwood was offered to play Coogan for the future NBC Mystery Movie Wheel , but turn down doing another TV  series.Universal revamp Coogan to the talents of Dennis Weaver. And McCloud was born. This fish outta water detective who spoke country wisdom, using his country ways and laid-back approach to nab the bad guys and never gave up. The show was a hit for both Weaver and NBC. McCloud stayed with Columbo and Millian to the end of the series in 1977.McCoud was assigned to the detective bureau headed by Chief Peter B. Clifford. One of the highlight of the show was McCloud was a foil to his chief, played richly by the late  J.D. Cannon.I am glad this show made in to DVD. However put more McCloud out soon. I want the John Denver episode from season five. Where most of Denver's dialog is the word ""Far out!""The addition of a McMillian and wife episode is NICE, but why use one that is on the McMillian DVD set?

But of such small things is Destiny compounded.  The Marshal's fugitive is literally kidnapped out from under his nose, and after recapturing him McCloud finds himself assigned to stay in the Big Apple and study ""big-city police methods.""  In fact it's more like showing the big city how well country methods work there.  Sam's down-home manner, careless approach to procedure, and homely saws often bewilder his reluctant partner, Sgt. Joe Broadhurst (Terry Carter), and infuriate his immediate superior, Chief Peter B. Clifford (Mark Richman in the pilot, J. D. Cannon thereafter), but he's tough, stubborn, shrewd, compassionate, a keen observer, and a close student of human nature, and somehow he always seems to get his man (or sometimes, in a nod to the developing power of Women's Lib, his woman).  Indeed, over time, though still often exasperated by him, Clifford comes to view him with more sympathy and respect (nothing succeeds like success, after all), while Sam quickly acquires a lady friend, journalist and author Chris Coughlin (Diana Muldaur), whose frequent mentions of him in her column tend to cause ""trouble in the bunkhouse,"" as Sam says.  (""Chief Clifford's jealous?""  ""Jealous ain't quite the word, try homicidal."")  46 when the series began and six years off his iconic role as Chester in ""Gunsmoke,"" Weaver was a perfect choice for the part of Marshal McCloud, which truly showcased his abilities as something other than a ""sidekick;"" his inimitable Joplin, MO, drawl and easy, lanky look made the character as much a standout as Chester ever was, and unique in the time period.  And while the 1970s ambience may seem somewhat dated, crime--and the passions that cause it--remains the same regardless of time period.  Unfortunately this two-season set only includes 11 episodes owing to the series's scheduling as part of a rotation, and while Seasons 3-4 are available in European format, Universal so far seems unwilling to release them in their native land.

However, I must agree with the other reviewers here who commented on the fact that the first season has been badly hacked. For some of you who may read this, but not understand what we mean, here's the poop.On September 16, 1970 NBC unveiled a new series called ""Four in One."" It was comprised of four mini-series:1. McCloud2. San Francisco International Airport3. Night Gallery4. The PsychiatristEach mini-series ran for a period of six consecutive weeks. Then they were rerun on a rotation basis. They aired on Wednesday nights from 10:00 - 11:00.""McCloud"" went on to the ""Mystery Movie"" series, ""San Francisco International Airport"" left the air with the ""Four in One"" series as did ""The Psychiatrist."" ""Night Gallery"" spun off into it's own series.On disc one, the ""Four in One"" episodes appear in 90 minute form, combining two 60 minute episodes. What a bummer!It would have been really great to see the original ""Four in One"" opening. I seem to remember a square with a black background, and they did something with the square, moving it around or having it morph into other things or something, it's really hard to remember because it was so long ago and I was all of 7 years old at the time. But, I seem to remember it stopped with a 4 in the box, making it look to my young mind like a child's block.Same with the ""Mystery Movie"" opening. Remember the guy (looked like McCloud to me) walking slowly toward the camera with a flashlight, shining it from side to side as shots for each element of the series would flash up? All the while that really neat whistling theme played. TV still had some pretty neat things at that time.Still, I'm glad to have this set.

630900,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,B00005JNHU,Robert I. Hedges,"[6, 7]","I always liked ""McCloud"" and was glad to see them being released on DVD. Although it's been covered by other reviewers, it's worth noting that the season one episodes are actually amalgams of two episodes cut together, normally in a fairly disjointed manner. I found the pilot interesting from an academic point of view, but the best episodes in the set are from season two, which are shown in their original versions.One thing that I had forgotten over the years was the amount of stock footage and repeated montage shots that pad out some of the episodes. While that is a bit annoying, overall the series is still very enjoyable, and has largely aged more gracefully than most contemporaries from the era (excepting ""Columbo."") Dennis Weaver is genuinely likeable as McCloud, and is a perfect contrast to Chief Clifford (J.D. Cannon), who is my favorite of the recurring characters in the series. (""McCloud!"")Many notable guest stars appear in the show, including Richard Dawson (who is extremely unlikable in one of the most recut of the season one episodes, ""Manhattan Manhunt""), Randolph Mantooth (from ""Emergency,"" and here seen in a much less likeable role that that of Johnny Gage), and even an evil Milton Berle who, along with Vic Tayback, star as evil theater producers in ""Give My Regrets to Broadway."" The writing and guest actors are somewhat uneven, and aside from the choppiness of the season one episodes, ""A Little Plot at Tranquil Valley"" (guest starring Burgess Meredith) is probably the weakest in overall execution. Throughout the series occasional bonuses occur such as McCloud accompanying a string quartet on his harmonica, and even singing!The set comes with a bonus episode of ""McMillan & Wife"" which I did not get all the way through, as I find it a bit more boring and dated than ""McCloud"" and ""Columbo."" I give the set four stars. It's great to see McCloud finally on DVD, though some extras would have been nice. I would have liked to see the season one shows in their original versions, as well, but there is doubt that the original versions exist at this point.",4,There Ya' Go!,1132790400,"11 24, 2005",2005,2094,"['always', 'liked', 'McCloud', 'was', 'glad', 'see', 'being', 'released', 'DVD', 'been', 'covered', 'other', 'reviewers', 'worth', 'noting', 'season', 'one', 'episodes', 'are', 'actually', 'amalgams', 'two', 'episodes', 'cut', 'together', 'normally', 'fairly', 'disjointed', 'manner', 'found', 'pilot', 'interesting', 'academic', 'point', 'view', 'best', 'episodes', 'set', 'are', 'season', 'two', 'are', 'shown', 'original', 'versions.One', 'thing', 'had', 'forgotten', 'years', 'was', 'amount', 'stock', 'footage', 'repeated', 'montage', 'shots', 'pad', 'out', 'episodes', 'bit', 'annoying', 'overall', 'series', 'still', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'largely', 'aged', 'more', 'gracefully', 'most', 'contemporaries', 'era', 'excepting', 'Columbo', 'Dennis', 'Weaver', 'genuinely', 'likeable', 'McCloud', 'perfect', 'contrast', 'Chief', 'Clifford', 'J.D', 'Cannon', 'who', 'favorite', 'recurring', 'characters', 'series', 'McCloud', 'Many', 'notable', 'guest', 'stars', 'appear', 'show', 'including', 'Richard', 'Dawson', 'who', 'extremely', 'unlikable', 'one', 'most', 'recut', 'season', 'one', 'Manhattan', 'Manhunt', 'Randolph', 'Mantooth', 'Emergency', 'here', 'seen', 'much', 'less', 'likeable', 'role', 'Johnny', 'Gage', 'even', 'evil', 'Milton', 'Berle', 'who', 'Vic', 'Tayback', 'star', 'evil', 'theater', 'producers', 'Give', 'My', 'Regrets', 'Broadway', 'writing', 'guest', 'actors', 'are', 'somewhat', 'uneven', 'aside', 'choppiness', 'season', 'one', 'Little', 'Plot', 'Tranquil', 'Valley', 'guest', 'starring', 'Burgess', 'Meredith', 'probably', 'weakest', 'overall', 'execution', 'series', 'occasional', 'bonuses', 'occur', 'such', 'McCloud', 'accompanying', 'string', 'quartet', 'harmonica', 'even', 'singing', 'set', 'bonus', 'episode', 'McMillan', 'Wife', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'way', 'find', 'bit', 'more', 'boring', 'dated', 'McCloud', 'Columbo', 'give', 'set', 'four', 'stars', 'great', 'see', 'McCloud', 'finally', 'DVD', 'extras', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'season', 'one', 'original', 'versions', 'as', 'well', 'doubt', 'original', 'versions', 'exist', 'point']",McCloud: Seasons One & Two

What we have here is the syndicated version which means that footage has been cut from the episodes as they combined various episodes into one 90 minute TV movie. The show in its original format would have earned five stars for its best episodes. The original elements for the series has to exist but Universal just elected not to bother and find them and/or restore them to their original length. That's too bad as it indicates a much larger problem that seems to exist at Universal's marketing department-they just don't care. It's just product for them. Warner Home Video actually takes pride and adds extras and commentaries to most of their TV on DVD releases. They actually bring value to fans. Universal, on the other hand, has only started adding more extras recently to select titles but keeping most bare bones. I'm not so sure about season two because I haven't seen many of these in years but the first season I do recall seeing in syndication and noticing footage missing. We do get the pilot episode as well which is a big plus.Looks like ""McCloud"" knocked the dust off his boots when he arrived on DVD. While there's some analog artifacts in the form of dirt, etc. that are evident in this transfer, the episodes look extremely good in an unforgiving format. Could they have been cleaned up a bit? Frankly, yes but their presentation is pretty solid overall. There is some digital artifacts evident but it's not a huge amount. The colors have faded a bit but overall given the age of the series ""McCloud"" looks pretty good. The mono sound doesn't offer much opportunity for improvement but that's fine as the dialog is clear and the music, despite occasional distortion, sounds good.Universal is doing its cross promotional thing again as they did with ""Sliders: Season Three""/""Earth 2""/""Cleopatra 2525"" where episodes from other genre related shows were put on as an extra. It's a pretty cheap extra and clever marketing I just don't think it's good value for customers.  Given that most of the main actors are still alive, it's a pity that there's no retrospective documentary or discussion of the popularity of this series. Weaver can be a charming storyteller and Muldaur captivating.
