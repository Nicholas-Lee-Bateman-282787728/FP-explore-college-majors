1506348,A1UN6KROLWZT17,B006074Q3O,An avid reader,"[10, 12]","This is one of the best video documentaries I've seen in a long time as Colin Gunn does a thorough job exposing the public education system for what it is. It truly is a pagan environment that our children are being placed in when they enter the public schools and most parents have no clue how much their children are being negatively programmed in the process. And for some reason, the real truth of what happens behind closed doors in the class rooms has managed to escape public scrutiny.Parents are under the mistaken impression that THEIR child's school is 'different' and that bad stuff only happens in those 'other' schools. But they are NOT being told what is happening inside the classrooms. They believe their child tells them what's going on but that is a mistaken impression and should not be overlooked if they care about the well being of their child.This documentary left me wanting to yell out to every parent with children, urging them to pull them out of public schools and either home school or send them to private or Christian church schools.If I had young children I would do everything in my power to see that they escaped the indoctrination of the public school system as it made me cringe watching the truth unfold in this well made documentary.This indoctrination is stealing our children's minds and there needs to be a mass exodus from the public school system in order to take them back and under the authority and guidance of their parents where it should be.",5,Everyone should see this.,1335916800,"05 2, 2012",2012,1490,"['one', 'best', 'video', 'documentaries', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'Colin', 'Gunn', 'thorough', 'job', 'exposing', 'public', 'education', 'system', 'what', 'truly', 'pagan', 'environment', 'children', 'are', 'being', 'placed', 'when', 'enter', 'public', 'schools', 'most', 'parents', 'have', 'clue', 'how', 'much', 'children', 'are', 'being', 'negatively', 'programmed', 'process', 'reason', 'real', 'truth', 'what', 'behind', 'closed', 'doors', 'class', 'rooms', 'managed', 'escape', 'public', 'scrutiny.Parents', 'are', 'mistaken', 'impression', 'THEIR', 'child', 'school', ""'different"", 'bad', 'stuff', 'only', ""'other"", 'schools', 'are', 'NOT', 'being', 'told', 'what', 'happening', 'classrooms', 'believe', 'child', 'what', 'going', 'mistaken', 'impression', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'overlooked', 'care', 'well', 'being', 'child.This', 'documentary', 'left', 'wanting', 'yell', 'out', 'parent', 'children', 'urging', 'pull', 'public', 'schools', 'home', 'school', 'send', 'private', 'Christian', 'church', 'schools.If', 'had', 'young', 'children', 'would', 'do', 'everything', 'power', 'see', 'escaped', 'indoctrination', 'public', 'school', 'system', 'made', 'cringe', 'watching', 'truth', 'unfold', 'well', 'made', 'documentary.This', 'indoctrination', 'stealing', 'children', 'minds', 'be', 'mass', 'exodus', 'public', 'school', 'system', 'order', 'take', 'back', 'authority', 'guidance', 'parents', 'where', 'should', 'be']",IndoctriNation: Public Schools and the Decline of Christianity in America

As a Christian myself, I was looking forward to the messages within. However, some of the interviews suggest the film maker's advocacy of the ideas that the earth was created in ""only seven days"" and that ""every word of the Bible is true"". These views severely constrict the delivery of an otherwise potent message to a very few people who manage to exclude scientific thought from their critical thinking process. Most Christian's I know have no problem folding Darwinism into ""God's methods"" and putting the metaphor of ""God"" above man's deductive interpretations of our collective experience. This film would have been better if it had aimed for a wider Christian audience than just those who get behind ""creationism"".",2,Fine if you believe in creationism,1362873600,"03 10, 2013",2013,828,"['documentary', 'left', 'dogged', 'prejudice', 'Christian', 'ideology', 'government', 'schools', 'Christian', 'myself', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'messages', 'However', 'interviews', 'suggest', 'film', 'maker', 'advocacy', 'ideas', 'earth', 'was', 'created', 'only', 'seven', 'days', 'word', 'Bible', 'true', 'views', 'severely', 'constrict', 'delivery', 'otherwise', 'potent', 'message', 'very', 'few', 'people', 'who', 'manage', 'exclude', 'scientific', 'thought', 'critical', 'thinking', 'process', 'Most', 'Christian', 'know', 'have', 'problem', 'folding', 'Darwinism', 'God', 'methods', 'putting', 'metaphor', 'God', 'man', 'deductive', 'interpretations', 'collective', 'experience', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'had', 'aimed', 'wider', 'Christian', 'audience', 'just', 'who', 'get', 'creationism']",IndoctriNation: Public Schools and the Decline of Christianity in America

1506351,A1BTUGG9C3VZEM,B006074Q3O,DARBY KERN,"[12, 16]","When I saw the trailer for this movie online a while back my first thought was, ""Come on. This is a no-brainer.""  I thought it would be showing the value of home schooling over public schools.  In my life I've met one home-schooled kid who wasn't miles ahead of his public-educated  counterparts, but when I met his mother it all fell into place.  And to be clear, my kids aren't home-schooled; they go to a Classical Christian academy- one of the board members let me watch his copy on dvd and now I plan on buying my own.Anyway, when I watched IndoctriNation: Public Schools and the Decline of Christianity in America I learned that, not only are public schools just lousy places of education, there is an agenda to corrupt the minds of our children and, you guessed it, indoctrinate them.  Using video and film footage of classrooms, speeches by the NEA leaders and newscasts from various American television stations we see how apathy and indifference from the parents have allowed the lunatics to take over the asylum.  Actually, that's not accurate: they BUILT the asylum in the first place and they've worked hard to keep anyone who disagrees with them on the outside.IndoctriNation: Public Schools and the Decline of Christianity in America argues that that's exactly where we should stay- outside the asylum.  As Christians we believe that the whole world is worthy of hearing the Gospel- and that's absolutely true.  However we think that sending our children into dangerous territory at a time in their life when they can't always discern true is a good idea.  We're trying to salt a truckload of onions.  Then we're surprised at how many of our children leave the church or live lives of outright disobedience.Colin Gunn takes his family on a roadtrip across America to seek out the truth about public education and reveals so much more than we imagined he could.  He makes stops in Boston, where the mess started, Dayton, Tennessee, where the Scopes trial took place and Denver, where the inevitable result of secular, humanistic teaching took place at Columbine High School on April 20, 1999.IndoctriNation: Public Schools and the Decline of Christianity in America is entertaining as well as being informational.  Of course our friends in the public education field will disagree or say they're the exception to what's presented here, but I think the movie presents itself in a clear way, leaving little room for argument.  My hope is that they will just admit it and move on.  If someone says that there isn't a targeted attack on Christianity just ask them if you can come lead a Bible study at the school.In Green Bay, Wisconsin the local fish-wrap/newspaper showed a picture (front page no less) of two Muslim children at an elementary school praying in the hallway.  A week later the ""Tebowing"" furor began.  Proof, if proof were needed, that our education system hates the name of Jesus Christ and will accept anything BUT Christianity in it's hallowed halls.Watch this movie because your children are too important to give over to these depraved minds.",5,You probably know what you don't know.,1326672000,"01 16, 2012",2012,3074,"['When', 'saw', 'trailer', 'movie', 'while', 'back', 'first', 'thought', 'was', 'Come', 'no-brainer', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'showing', 'value', 'home', 'schooling', 'public', 'schools', 'life', ""'ve"", 'met', 'one', 'home-schooled', 'kid', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'miles', 'ahead', 'public-educated', 'counterparts', 'when', 'met', 'mother', 'fell', 'place', 'be', 'clear', 'kids', 'are', ""n't"", 'home-schooled', 'go', 'Classical', 'Christian', 'academy-', 'one', 'board', 'members', 'let', 'watch', 'copy', 'dvd', 'now', 'plan', 'buying', 'own.Anyway', 'when', 'watched', 'IndoctriNation', 'Public', 'Schools', 'Decline', 'Christianity', 'America', 'learned', 'not', 'only', 'are', 'public', 'schools', 'just', 'lousy', 'places', 'education', 'agenda', 'corrupt', 'minds', 'children', 'guessed', 'indoctrinate', 'Using', 'video', 'film', 'footage', 'classrooms', 'speeches', 'NEA', 'leaders', 'newscasts', 'various', 'American', 'television', 'stations', 'see', 'how', 'apathy', 'indifference', 'parents', 'have', 'allowed', 'lunatics', 'take', 'over', 'asylum', 'Actually', 'not', 'accurate', 'BUILT', 'asylum', 'first', 'place', ""'ve"", 'worked', 'hard', 'keep', 'anyone', 'who', 'outside.IndoctriNation', 'Public', 'Schools', 'Decline', 'Christianity', 'America', 'exactly', 'where', 'should', 'stay-', 'asylum', 'Christians', 'believe', 'whole', 'world', 'worthy', 'hearing', 'Gospel-', 'absolutely', 'true', 'However', 'think', 'sending', 'children', 'dangerous', 'territory', 'time', 'life', 'when', 'ca', ""n't"", 'always', 'discern', 'true', 'good', 'idea', ""'re"", 'trying', 'salt', 'truckload', 'onions', 'Then', ""'re"", 'surprised', 'how', 'many', 'children', 'leave', 'church', 'live', 'lives', 'outright', 'disobedience.Colin', 'Gunn', 'family', 'roadtrip', 'America', 'seek', 'out', 'truth', 'public', 'education', 'reveals', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'imagined', 'could', 'stops', 'Boston', 'where', 'mess', 'started', 'Dayton', 'Tennessee', 'where', 'Scopes', 'trial', 'took', 'place', 'Denver', 'where', 'inevitable', 'result', 'secular', 'humanistic', 'teaching', 'took', 'place', 'Columbine', 'High', 'School', 'April', '20', '1999.IndoctriNation', 'Public', 'Schools', 'Decline', 'Christianity', 'America', 'entertaining', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'informational', 'course', 'friends', 'public', 'education', 'field', 'will', 'disagree', 'say', ""'re"", 'exception', 'what', 'presented', 'here', 'think', 'movie', 'clear', 'way', 'leaving', 'little', 'room', 'argument', 'hope', 'will', 'just', 'admit', 'move', 'someone', ""n't"", 'targeted', 'attack', 'Christianity', 'just', 'ask', 'can', 'come', 'lead', 'Bible', 'study', 'school.In', 'Green', 'Bay', 'Wisconsin', 'local', 'fish-wrap/newspaper', 'showed', 'picture', 'front', 'page', 'no', 'less', 'two', 'Muslim', 'children', 'elementary', 'school', 'praying', 'hallway', 'week', 'later', 'Tebowing', 'furor', 'began', 'Proof', 'proof', 'were', 'needed', 'education', 'system', 'name', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'will', 'accept', 'anything', 'BUT', 'Christianity', 'hallowed', 'halls.Watch', 'movie', 'children', 'are', 'too', 'important', 'give', 'depraved', 'minds']",IndoctriNation: Public Schools and the Decline of Christianity in America

It's  informative, academic, educational and highly stimulating approach to such a controversial topic drives this film smoother than the most modern yellow bus. Colin Gunn appears to have a strong passion for individual cognition, liberty, freedom, and not suprisingly Christian values. For some of us who are not aware of the degradation of the American public school system or who might be in profound denial should carefully view this film. I feel this film raises more questions than answers and further leads a prospective viewer into more different topics that are all relevant to this on going crisis. It is not far fetched to say that Colin Gunn is very aware of this.Colin Gunn handles the yellow school bus quite nicely; moreover, he packs it with his wife and seven of his own children to tour the nation and research the present school system. He speaks and interviews all the different walks of educational and professional life; principles, pastors, theologicans, and teachers (John Taylor Gatto, one of my favorite interviews) ect. There are many topics to discuss and debate here but what I thought was so prevalently dominant in Colin Gunn's message was how he exposes the detrimental effects of a population without a unifying and binding culture. Or more specifically, what happens when a system of Christian values is replaced by something secular and scientific that is based on man's opinions as opposed to a higher power.
