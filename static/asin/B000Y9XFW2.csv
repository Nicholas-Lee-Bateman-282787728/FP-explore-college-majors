As a new mom, I had no idea what my tummy would look like after having a baby. I desperately wanted to regain my flat tummy. This DVD offers new ways to regain your ab muscles without doing the standard crunches. I love that there are yoga and pilates influences in these workouts. It is a great way to work and retrain your core! As always, Lindsay is a great motivator and offers such refreshing advice on helping you regain your abs!!",5,Not your typical ab workout,1270080000,"04 1, 2010",2010,517,"[""'re"", 'looking', 'innovative', 'way', 'work', 'core', 'muscles', 'new', 'mom', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'tummy', 'would', 'look', 'having', 'baby', 'desperately', 'wanted', 'regain', 'flat', 'tummy', 'DVD', 'new', 'ways', 'regain', 'ab', 'muscles', 'doing', 'standard', 'crunches', 'love', 'are', 'yoga', 'pilates', 'influences', 'workouts', 'great', 'way', 'work', 'retrain', 'core', 'always', 'Lindsay', 'great', 'motivator', 'offers', 'such', 'refreshing', 'advice', 'helping', 'regain', 'abs']",Lindsay Brin's CORE Fitness for Moms

With this DVD, my abs were sore for the first time in my life. I felt ab muscles that I never knew I had, and I had worked out a lot prior to giving birth. I misplaced this DVD for a few weeks, and I love it so much, I considered buying it again. i love it!",5,my favorite core DVD!,1269993600,"03 31, 2010",2010,397,"['wish', 'had', 'DVD', 'becoming', 'mom', 'spine', 'fused', 'can', 'not', 'do', 'lot', 'traditional', 'core', 'exercises', 'crunches', 'DVD', 'abs', 'were', 'sore', 'first', 'time', 'life', 'felt', 'ab', 'muscles', 'never', 'knew', 'had', 'had', 'worked', 'out', 'lot', 'prior', 'giving', 'birth', 'misplaced', 'DVD', 'few', 'weeks', 'love', 'so', 'much', 'considered', 'buying', 'again', 'i', 'love']",Lindsay Brin's CORE Fitness for Moms

After having 2 kids, my mid section really showed it, and I was pretty hopeless. This DVD has totally helped (and gave me hope!). It re-taught me how to properly use my core muscles, to do abdominal exercises (and all exercises) correctly and effectively. And I love that it has varied levels so it's still a challenge for me to complete everything. I'm so happy that my core is stronger and flatter.",5,"Mom or not, this dvd is so great!",1270080000,"04 1, 2010",2010,521,"['was', 'mom', 'was', 'competed', 'Olympic', 'weightlifting', 'was', 'very', 'tone', 'pretty', 'much', 'took', 'granted', 'having', '2', 'kids', 'mid', 'section', 'really', 'showed', 'was', 'pretty', 'hopeless', 'DVD', 'totally', 'helped', 'gave', 'hope', 're-taught', 'how', 'properly', 'use', 'core', 'muscles', 'do', 'abdominal', 'exercises', 'exercises', 'correctly', 'effectively', 'love', 'varied', 'levels', 'still', 'challenge', 'complete', 'everything', ""'m"", 'so', 'happy', 'core', 'stronger', 'flatter']",Lindsay Brin's CORE Fitness for Moms

I am in the best shape of my life (because of Lindsay's videos) and this video challenges me each time I do it! It not only works your core, but all of your major muscle groups. And your heart rate does elevate as well! There is also a great yoga workout that I love too! You honestly can't go wrong spending $20 on this video! I am such a fan of anything Lindsay creates! They'll whip you into shape so fast (I am down to my pants size and weight of my freshman year of high school- got there in 6 months!).

1116536,A1K2EM1HZ2IE68,B000Y9XFW2,"tinkerbell0023 ""tinkerbell0023""","[3, 3]","I bought this DVD to use on my days off from Lindsay Brin's Boot Camp DVD, which I love. I thought this DVD would be purely core exercises, and that it would be more challenging. Boot Camp has really shaped up my lower body, but my core needs more work. This DVD is ok, it's just not as good as Boot Camp is. If I had done this DVD before Boot Camp, it might have been more challenging for me. The menu allows you to pick different workouts - the full core workout, full core workout without the 2 min intro, the express core workout (without the 15 min standing segment), or the Pilates/Yoga workout. The actual core workout concentrates on the core, but also includes exercises for the whole body. This is fine, just not very challenging. They use 5 lb weights or none at all (depending on if you're watching beginning, intermediate, or advanced). What surprised me was the Pilates/Yoga workout. I don't generally like Yoga, and only do Pilates occasionally, but I think this workout is a more challenging core workout. The ""Ab 5"" section at the beginning (the 5 core exercises Lindsay always includes) are fast paced, had many reps, and  was difficult! I think this was around 10 min of the 25 min workout. The rest of the workout includes a lot of balancing poses with movement so you have to really work your core. I think I will use this one more than the other. There is also a lot of information in this DVD. Lindsay gives a couple of informative talks about how to use your core. If you've done some of Lindsay's other DVDs, you kind of know what to expect with Lindsay, Michelle, and Amy, and also the feel for the filming and cameras. It's ok, it's just not Lindsay at her best. I'll still use it some, just not as often as I thought. I think Suzanne Bowen's 10 Minute Solutions Blast Off Belly Fat is or Suzanne's Gorgeous Core are more challenging core workouts that will really help tighten and flatten.",3,"I love Lindsay Brin, but this DVD...not so much.",1370304000,"06 4, 2013",2013,1917,"['bought', 'DVD', 'use', 'days', 'Lindsay', 'Brin', 'Boot', 'Camp', 'DVD', 'love', 'thought', 'DVD', 'would', 'be', 'purely', 'core', 'exercises', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'challenging', 'Boot', 'Camp', 'really', 'shaped', 'up', 'lower', 'body', 'core', 'more', 'work', 'DVD', 'ok', 'just', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'Boot', 'Camp', 'had', 'done', 'DVD', 'Boot', 'Camp', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'challenging', 'menu', 'pick', 'different', 'workouts', 'full', 'core', 'workout', 'full', 'core', 'workout', '2', 'min', 'intro', 'express', 'core', 'workout', '15', 'min', 'standing', 'segment', 'Pilates/Yoga', 'workout', 'actual', 'core', 'workout', 'concentrates', 'core', 'also', 'exercises', 'whole', 'body', 'fine', 'just', 'not', 'very', 'challenging', 'use', '5', 'lb', 'weights', 'none', 'depending', ""'re"", 'watching', 'beginning', 'intermediate', 'advanced', 'What', 'surprised', 'was', 'Pilates/Yoga', 'workout', 'do', ""n't"", 'generally', 'like', 'Yoga', 'only', 'do', 'Pilates', 'occasionally', 'think', 'workout', 'more', 'challenging', 'core', 'workout', 'Ab', '5', 'section', 'beginning', '5', 'core', 'exercises', 'Lindsay', 'always', 'are', 'fast', 'paced', 'had', 'many', 'reps', 'was', 'difficult', 'think', 'was', '10', 'min', '25', 'min', 'workout', 'rest', 'workout', 'lot', 'balancing', 'poses', 'movement', 'so', 'have', 'really', 'work', 'core', 'think', 'will', 'use', 'one', 'more', 'other', 'also', 'lot', 'information', 'DVD', 'Lindsay', 'couple', 'informative', 'talks', 'how', 'use', 'core', ""'ve"", 'done', 'Lindsay', 'other', 'DVDs', 'kind', 'what', 'expect', 'Lindsay', 'Michelle', 'Amy', 'also', 'feel', 'filming', 'cameras', 'ok', 'just', 'not', 'Lindsay', 'best', ""'ll"", 'still', 'use', 'just', 'not', 'as', 'often', 'thought', 'think', 'Suzanne', 'Bowen', '10', 'Minute', 'Solutions', 'Blast', 'Off', 'Belly', 'Fat', 'Suzanne', 'Gorgeous', 'Core', 'are', 'more', 'challenging', 'core', 'workouts', 'will', 'really', 'help', 'tighten', 'flatten']",Lindsay Brin's CORE Fitness for Moms
