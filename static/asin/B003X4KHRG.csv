Does it hold up? In a word, yes. It's not as good as Blue Harvest or Something, Something, Something Dark Side, but it's quite watchable and entertaining.The story begins with our heroes sitting around watching TV. The lights go out, Stewie says, ""Does this mean we're gonna do Jedi?"" and Peter says, ""Might as well get this over with."" From there we go to the opening crawl, wherein it's revealed, possibly accurately, that the Family Guy people didn't want to do this one. We go from there to the usual set of sight gags and familiar characters in new roles, including appearances by Roger, Klaus, Rallo and Tim the Bear. You get Meg in the expected spot, though the addition of someone very unexpected as the Rancor was quite fun.There's several times I laughed out loud, including the Emperor's efforts to get Luke angry by dissing on Seth Green, or Peter/Han's efforts to make the movie ""darker"". While overall it wasn't quite as good as the other ones, or as funny as the TV series at its best, it was still very good and I feel happy that I bought it.Extras include a digital copy that I was able to put onto my computer, but wasn't able to get it onto my phone using the PocketBlu feature. I spent several frustrating minutes trying before I gave up. There's also the expected commentary, a drawing lesson, ""sock puppet"" stuff and more! It's not something you'll really be likely to buy for the extras, but it's good to have them there.Overall this was a purchase I was quite pleased with, and if you don't own the previous installments, you can get this, plus those, in a big ole boxed set set for a reasonable price.

1370107,A1X5MSSAPEY92J,B003X4KHRG,C.Raven,"[0, 1]","Family Guy creator, star and comical genius Seth McFarlane admits in plain yellow text, not even two minutes into the film, that after burning throughBlue HarvestandSomething, Something, Something, Dark Sidethat the crew had no gas left for It's a Trap!, and that without the third Star Wars spoof, Fox wouldn't let him work onTed. Some might call this the biggest disappointment not only among the Family Guy Star Wars spoofs, but in the entire Family Guy series. Those people are wrong, but there are certainly more Family Guy episodes that are better than this one than those that are worse.Without a doubt, this is the weakest entry in the Star Wars spoof series. It spends almost as much time making fun of itself as it does the source material (Return of the Jedi). Instead of reusing Family Guy characters to fill different roles like they did from BH going into SSSDS, characters were brought in from McFarlane's other shows American Dad and The Cleveland Show to share the screen. While some parts of the parody are more or less direct transitions from Jedi, such as the roughly 90 second set up to ""I don't know, fly casual,"" the punchline is worth the wait more often than not. While It's a Trap! has a slower paced humor (largely due to the lengthy setups mentioned before), it still manages to retain the Family Guy air with a few nonchalant fart, sex, religion, gay and black jokes to go around and a few moments of hyper violence to ease the tension.To sum up, yes, this is bad. But it's not nearly as bad as Seth McFarlane makes it out to be in the opening title scrawl. In my opinion, Seth is his own worst critic and It's a Trap! is still worth watching.",3,Seth Says Sorry?

1370108,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B003X4KHRG,DanD,"[1, 1]","There's no denying that FAMILY GUY is no more the sarcastic, in-your-face irreverent sitcom that it once was.  Now, it's almost a parody of its former self; the intro text to this film is so full of self-referencing egotism that one wishes Fox would fire Seth MacFarlane for a day, just so he has a sense of how unfunny he is now.  And there are so many jokes in here that fall flat that it makes you yearn for SOMETHING, SOMETHING, SOMETHING DARK SIDE (which is only better than IT'S A TRAP because its source film was better).All of that being said...you'll note the 3 Stars.  That's because, when IT'S A TRAP hits its stride (inconsistent though it may be), it's hilarious.  STAR WARS fans won't get as much a kick out of it as the first two in the mock-trilogy (there are far fewer insider jokes), but FAMILY GUY aficionados (even if, like me, you now longer keep up with the show itself) will enjoy seeing their favorite (and least favorite; the video store clerk as Yoda has to be at the bottom of a long list of bad decisions) characters from the series portraying the legendary George Lucas creations.  It's still a delight to see Stewie as Darth Vader; he still remains the show's funniest character, alongside Peter (both of whom are superbly voiced by MacFarlane; say what you want to about his waning sense of humor, but the man knows how to voice characters).  And the musical takes on the STAR WARS theme (there's a great disco sequence) remain inspired.So basically, IT'S A TRAP is for die-hard FAMILY GUY fans only.  All others, stick with the show (or, rather, the first four seasons; maybe even the fifth, if you're drunk enough).  And if you aren't a fan of the show, then there's no reason for even reading this review or checking out the movie.  It's great moments are good, but its worst moments are almost deplorable.  Here's hoping that MacFarlane will hit his stride with his next show (which is decidedly not THE CLEVELAND SHOW, and AMERICAN DAD has lost all of its promising potential).",3,"""Turn to the backside of the force.""",1293580800,"12 29, 2010",2010,2013,"['denying', 'FAMILY', 'GUY', 'more', 'sarcastic', 'in-your-face', 'irreverent', 'sitcom', 'once', 'was', 'Now', 'almost', 'parody', 'former', 'self', 'intro', 'text', 'film', 'so', 'full', 'self-referencing', 'egotism', 'one', 'Fox', 'would', 'fire', 'Seth', 'MacFarlane', 'day', 'just', 'so', 'sense', 'how', 'unfunny', 'now', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'jokes', 'here', 'fall', 'flat', 'yearn', 'SOMETHING', 'SOMETHING', 'SOMETHING', 'DARK', 'SIDE', 'only', 'better', 'IT', 'TRAP', 'source', 'film', 'was', 'better', '.All', 'being', 'said', ""'ll"", 'note', '3', 'Stars', 'because', 'when', 'IT', 'A', 'TRAP', 'stride', 'inconsistent', 'may', 'be', 'hilarious', 'STAR', 'WARS', 'fans', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'as', 'much', 'kick', 'first', 'two', 'mock-trilogy', 'are', 'far', 'fewer', 'insider', 'jokes', 'FAMILY', 'GUY', 'aficionados', 'even', 'now', 'longer', 'keep', 'up', 'show', 'will', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'favorite', 'least', 'favorite', 'video', 'store', 'clerk', 'Yoda', 'be', 'bottom', 'long', 'list', 'bad', 'decisions', 'characters', 'series', 'portraying', 'legendary', 'George', 'Lucas', 'creations', 'still', 'delight', 'see', 'Stewie', 'Darth', 'Vader', 'still', 'show', 'funniest', 'character', 'alongside', 'Peter', 'whom', 'are', 'superbly', 'voiced', 'MacFarlane', 'say', 'what', 'want', 'waning', 'sense', 'humor', 'man', 'how', 'voice', 'characters', 'musical', 'STAR', 'WARS', 'theme', 'great', 'disco', 'sequence', 'remain', 'inspired.So', 'basically', 'IT', 'A', 'TRAP', 'die-hard', 'FAMILY', 'GUY', 'only', 'others', 'stick', 'show', 'rather', 'first', 'four', 'seasons', 'maybe', 'even', 'fifth', ""'re"", 'drunk', 'enough', 'are', ""n't"", 'fan', 'show', 'then', 'reason', 'even', 'reading', 'review', 'checking', 'out', 'movie', 'great', 'moments', 'are', 'good', 'worst', 'moments', 'are', 'almost', 'deplorable', 'Here', 'hoping', 'MacFarlane', 'will', 'hit', 'stride', 'next', 'show', 'decidedly', 'not', 'THE', 'CLEVELAND', 'SHOW', 'AMERICAN', 'DAD', 'lost', 'promising', 'potential']",Family Guy: It's A Trap!

I know Return of the Jedi was considered by some to be the worst Star Wars movie of the original trilogy, but Seth could have done a better overall job.  The jokes were mostly older ones from the series that have been done hundreds of times.  But then again the opening crawler warns us that this episode was done for money, and Seth really did not want to do it.  So I guess the ending joke is on us.  I will not ruin it for you, just be warned this is not as good as the first 2 Star Wars spoofs.NOTE:  I just watched Robot Chicken episode 3 and I can say it was great.  150% better than this family guy episode.  It is almost like the original writers of Blue Harvest were hired to do the new Robot Chicken.  Now on to what I really wanted to say.  After being taunted for this review I decided to rewatch this DVD screener.  In the end I felt like changing my rating to 2 stars, but decided to let my original rating stand.  I still think this is the worst STAR WARS Family Guy Parody.  I did have a chuckle when I realized the Rancor was actually RUSH Limbaugh, but the humor soon faded.  The reason is because they use most of the same jokes they already did in the first two and then over used them throughout this parody.  Like for example there is section of this show were they are shaking their heads for several minutes while they are waiting to throw Luke in the Sarlac Pit.  AS soon as it ends, you think okay now it is time for the action, but just seconds later Han and Chewie make this same gesture again when they are attacked by Boba Chicken.  Even worse is they nod heir head until Boba simply vanishes.  When Han asks what happened to Boba, Chewie simply comments ""He fell into the pit.""  To some this may have been funny, but I think it was a missed opportunity.  Instead of making this boring they could have stole from Robot Chicken and had Boba fall into the pit in a funny way, then claim he jumped in (or did something completely different that was funnier than this lame excuse for a joke).Another scene repeated from the first parody is the appearance of John Williams and his orchestra.  Only this time they are on bicycles (you will understand why when you see this scene).  Once more Luke asks them if they could play something different and they do.  There are several more examples I could throw out there but in the end this is only my opinion of this show.  Yours may differ.And before I am asked again.

1370118,AUUH6Z8MSGGF,B003X4KHRG,Haunted Flower,"[1, 1]","1 Disc DVD + Digital Copy, released December 21, 2010Well, ""Family Guy"" has come this far so it just makes sense to continue the rest of the way into the Return of the Jedi remake. This movie being released on Blu-ray and DVD is definitely Fox seeing the dollar signs and their jokes starting to get a little lazy and reaching as they admit in their opening credits.The big difference between Robot Chicken's Star Wars parodies and Family Guy's is the jokes. Robot Chicken comes up with bits specifically worked around jokes and situations that they find hilarious and piece them together at random to make you bust a gut. Family Guy chose to go complete parody using their own characters almost line for line by the original script and then trying to make it funny. Family Guy IS funny, it's just that the format locks them into a sequence of events that follow the movie and they have to work within those confines. For example, the hover bike chase scene through the forest becomes an actual bicycle chase with explosions. They've run out of Family Guy characters to use so they've started borrowing from ""American Dad"" and ""The Cleveland Show"". The German fish character actually gets the ""It's a trap!"" line.Some of the jokes they really nail, especially in the last fifteen minutes or so. They pull in some classic Family Guy pranks of letting a joke go on WAY too long (nodding to each other in sequence) and throwing in a ""Darth Twitty"" clip (Conway Twitty with a photoshopped Darth Vader helmet on his head). Tim the Bear from ""The Cleveland Show"" is the Ewok with speaking lines and Rallo is partnered with Mort playing Lando for the Millenium Falcon battle scenes. The Ewok battles are far more bloody than you might remember in ""Return of the Jedi"" as some anti-Ewok creators were clearly getting their revenge. It's funny and if you saw the other two you should watch this.Bonus Features:Obviously, there is a digital copy. There is some sort of short episode advertisement for ""Bob's Burgers"" that starts up before getting to the menu that I had to skip past because I wanted to watch the show with family. When I watched it later, it wasn't very good.The Star Wars Trivial Pursuit championship is a very dramatic extra involving producers and writers who worked on the story for Family Guy: It's a Trap getting together at a warehouse to play Star Wars Trivial Pursuit so one could become ultimate champion of Star Wars Knowledge. No, Seth MacFarlane is not there but familiar voices you have heard on commentary are. There is David Goodman (who sounds like the guy from ""Everybody Loves Raymond""), Cherry with the longest last name ever that looks fake but isn't, Alec Sulkin, and Kirker. I'm pretty sure I've played this exact game before and some of it is HARD! It's a fun way to test your own skills if you can get the answer before they do.Drawing with Peter Shin is a cute little ""how to draw the characters"" bit. If sketching and cartooning is your deal, this is for you. It's amazing how much personality can be captured quickly in sharpie! The Sock Puppet outtakes are short-lived, the Animatic and Making the Scene both show how the original animation transfers to the final version.A very special message from Darth Stewie is a voicemail from Darth to his son, Luke about his technology difficulties making a photo slideshow. The feature-length audio commentary features Seth MacFarlane, David A. Goodman, Cherry Chevapravatdumrong (see what I mean??), Shannon Smith, and Peter Shin. Seth leaves about halfway through because he is very busy and important but while the show originated from him, it clearly has a life of its own now listening to the others talking about it. These other guys are mostly the ones behind the creative, the writing, and the directing. They verify that everything written in the opening credits is true and greet the listening audience with affectionate expletives.",4,The jokes are getting lazy but several still bust a gut!,1293840000,"01 1, 2011",2011,3920,"['1', 'Disc', 'DVD', '+', 'Digital', 'Copy', 'released', 'December', '21', '2010Well', 'Family', 'Guy', 'come', 'far', 'just', 'sense', 'continue', 'rest', 'way', 'Return', 'Jedi', 'remake', 'movie', 'being', 'released', 'Blu-ray', 'DVD', 'definitely', 'Fox', 'seeing', 'dollar', 'signs', 'jokes', 'starting', 'get', 'little', 'lazy', 'reaching', 'admit', 'opening', 'credits.The', 'big', 'difference', 'Robot', 'Chicken', 'Star', 'Wars', 'parodies', 'Family', 'Guy', 'jokes', 'Robot', 'Chicken', 'up', 'bits', 'specifically', 'worked', 'jokes', 'situations', 'find', 'hilarious', 'piece', 'together', 'random', 'make', 'bust', 'gut', 'Family', 'Guy', 'chose', 'go', 'complete', 'parody', 'using', 'own', 'characters', 'almost', 'line', 'line', 'original', 'script', 'then', 'trying', 'make', 'funny', 'Family', 'Guy', 'IS', 'funny', 'just', 'format', 'sequence', 'events', 'follow', 'movie', 'have', 'work', 'confines', 'example', 'hover', 'bike', 'chase', 'scene', 'forest', 'actual', 'bicycle', 'chase', 'explosions', ""'ve"", 'run', 'Family', 'Guy', 'characters', 'use', 'so', ""'ve"", 'started', 'borrowing', 'American', 'Dad', 'Cleveland', 'Show', 'German', 'fish', 'character', 'actually', 'trap', 'line.Some', 'jokes', 'really', 'nail', 'especially', 'last', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'so', 'pull', 'classic', 'Family', 'Guy', 'pranks', 'letting', 'joke', 'go', 'WAY', 'too', 'long', 'nodding', 'other', 'sequence', 'throwing', 'Darth', 'Twitty', 'clip', 'Conway', 'Twitty', 'photoshopped', 'Darth', 'Vader', 'helmet', 'head', 'Tim', 'Bear', 'Cleveland', 'Show', 'Ewok', 'speaking', 'lines', 'Rallo', 'partnered', 'Mort', 'playing', 'Lando', 'Millenium', 'Falcon', 'battle', 'scenes', 'Ewok', 'battles', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'bloody', 'might', 'remember', 'Return', 'Jedi', 'anti-Ewok', 'creators', 'were', 'clearly', 'getting', 'revenge', 'funny', 'saw', 'other', 'two', 'should', 'watch', 'this.Bonus', 'Features', 'Obviously', 'digital', 'copy', 'sort', 'short', 'episode', 'advertisement', 'Bob', 'Burgers', 'up', 'getting', 'menu', 'had', 'skip', 'wanted', 'watch', 'show', 'family', 'When', 'watched', 'later', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'good.The', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Trivial', 'Pursuit', 'championship', 'very', 'dramatic', 'extra', 'involving', 'producers', 'writers', 'who', 'worked', 'story', 'Family', 'Guy', 'Trap', 'getting', 'together', 'warehouse', 'play', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Trivial', 'Pursuit', 'one', 'could', 'become', 'ultimate', 'champion', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Knowledge', 'No', 'Seth', 'MacFarlane', 'not', 'there', 'familiar', 'voices', 'have', 'heard', 'commentary', 'are', 'David', 'Goodman', 'who', 'guy', 'Everybody', 'Raymond', 'Cherry', 'longest', 'last', 'name', 'ever', 'fake', ""n't"", 'Alec', 'Sulkin', 'Kirker', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', ""'ve"", 'played', 'exact', 'game', 'HARD', 'fun', 'way', 'test', 'own', 'skills', 'can', 'get', 'answer', 'do.Drawing', 'Peter', 'Shin', 'cute', 'little', 'how', 'draw', 'characters', 'bit', 'sketching', 'cartooning', 'deal', 'amazing', 'how', 'much', 'personality', 'can', 'be', 'captured', 'quickly', 'sharpie', 'Sock', 'Puppet', 'outtakes', 'are', 'short-lived', 'Animatic', 'Making', 'Scene', 'show', 'how', 'original', 'animation', 'transfers', 'final', 'version.A', 'very', 'special', 'message', 'Darth', 'Stewie', 'voicemail', 'Darth', 'son', 'Luke', 'technology', 'difficulties', 'making', 'photo', 'slideshow', 'feature-length', 'audio', 'commentary', 'features', 'Seth', 'MacFarlane', 'David', 'A.', 'Goodman', 'Cherry', 'Chevapravatdumrong', 'see', 'what', 'mean', 'Shannon', 'Smith', 'Peter', 'Shin', 'Seth', 'halfway', 'very', 'busy', 'important', 'show', 'originated', 'clearly', 'life', 'own', 'now', 'listening', 'others', 'talking', 'other', 'guys', 'are', 'mostly', 'ones', 'creative', 'writing', 'directing', 'verify', 'everything', 'written', 'opening', 'credits', 'true', 'greet', 'listening', 'audience', 'affectionate', 'expletives']",Family Guy: It's A Trap!

1370126,A1P2NBM3P3TS2X,B003X4KHRG,"John S. Harris ""The Voice of Reason""","[0, 1]","I watched it twice this weekend and a third time with the commentary track.I found it to be just as enjoyable as the previous two parodies.  ""Jedi"" is widely regarded as the least satisfying installment of the Star Wars original trilogy.  Part of that may stem from the general disdain towards the ""cuteness quotient"" of the Ewoks, and part of that might simply be because ""The Empires Strikes Back"" was a hard act to follow.  Truth be told, anyone trying to parody ""Return of the Jedi"" simply has less fruitful material to work with.The ""Family Guy"" staff readily admits they had trouble writing this episode.  It's hard to parody the same thing three times and keep it fresh.  But I think they did a more than adequate job with it.  And visually it is even more spectacular than the previous two.It may not be as consistently funny as ""Blue Harvest"" or ""Something, Something, Something Dark Side"", but you must admit that the novelty of a Family Guy parody of a Star Wars film has worn off a bit by now.  Given that, I think writers David Goodman and Cherry Chevapravatdumrong did a fine job.  I am happy to add this DVD to my library alongside the other two parodies.Speaking of staff writer Cherry Chevapravatdumrong, she is one of the four writers of these parodies featured in the DVD bonus content feature in which they compete in a game of Star Wars Trivial Pursuit.  Cherry is very easy on the eyes, if you know what I mean, and it wouldn't surprise me if she started getting a little bit of fan mail.  Not only is she a Star Wars fan, she also went to Yale and later earned a law degree.  She's good-looking, funny, smart, AND a little nerdy.  I'm in love from afar!That aside, ""It's A Trap!"" is better than the negative reviews here would indicate.  It manages to skewer the film and maintain its ""Family Guy"" sensibility.This one is similar enough in tone and execution to the previous two parodies that I believe anyone who loved the first two but gave this one a deeply negative review is just over-reacting. For something to be truly deserving of a one- or two-star review, it really needs to be crummy on just about every level.  That would not be the case here.  I think the large number of low-star reviews here are from people who just were disappointed that it didn't meet their high expectations for whatever reasons, and they angrily dismissed the film as being worse than it truly is.  But hey, that's the Internet for you.I think my favorite joke in the whole episode was the ""Power Station"" gag.  If you weren't listening to rock radio in the mid 1980's, you might not get the joke.  But this show is for us over-40 adults too, not just you young whippersnappers.",5,Much funnier than all the negative reviews say it is,1295827200,"01 24, 2011",2011,2688,"['watched', 'twice', 'weekend', 'third', 'time', 'commentary', 'track.I', 'found', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'enjoyable', 'previous', 'two', 'parodies', 'Jedi', 'widely', 'regarded', 'least', 'satisfying', 'installment', 'Star', 'Wars', 'original', 'trilogy', 'Part', 'may', 'stem', 'general', 'disdain', 'cuteness', 'quotient', 'Ewoks', 'part', 'might', 'simply', 'be', 'Empires', 'Strikes', 'Back', 'was', 'hard', 'act', 'follow', 'Truth', 'be', 'told', 'anyone', 'trying', 'parody', 'Return', 'Jedi', 'simply', 'less', 'fruitful', 'material', 'work', 'with.The', 'Family', 'Guy', 'staff', 'readily', 'had', 'trouble', 'writing', 'episode', 'hard', 'parody', 'same', 'thing', 'three', 'times', 'keep', 'fresh', 'think', 'did', 'more', 'adequate', 'job', 'visually', 'even', 'more', 'spectacular', 'previous', 'two.It', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'consistently', 'Blue', 'Harvest', 'Something', 'Something', 'Something', 'Dark', 'Side', 'must', 'admit', 'novelty', 'Family', 'Guy', 'parody', 'Star', 'Wars', 'film', 'worn', 'off', 'bit', 'now', 'Given', 'think', 'writers', 'David', 'Goodman', 'Cherry', 'Chevapravatdumrong', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'am', 'happy', 'add', 'DVD', 'library', 'other', 'two', 'parodies.Speaking', 'staff', 'writer', 'Cherry', 'Chevapravatdumrong', 'one', 'four', 'writers', 'parodies', 'featured', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'content', 'feature', 'compete', 'game', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Trivial', 'Pursuit', 'Cherry', 'very', 'easy', 'eyes', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'would', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'started', 'getting', 'little', 'bit', 'fan', 'mail', 'Not', 'only', 'Star', 'Wars', 'fan', 'also', 'went', 'Yale', 'later', 'earned', 'law', 'degree', 'good-looking', 'funny', 'smart', 'little', 'nerdy', ""'m"", 'love', 'afar', 'aside', 'Trap', 'better', 'negative', 'reviews', 'here', 'would', 'indicate', 'skewer', 'film', 'maintain', 'Family', 'Guy', 'sensibility.This', 'one', 'similar', 'enough', 'tone', 'execution', 'previous', 'two', 'parodies', 'believe', 'anyone', 'who', 'loved', 'first', 'two', 'gave', 'one', 'deeply', 'negative', 'review', 'just', 'over-reacting', 'something', 'be', 'truly', 'deserving', 'one-', 'two-star', 'review', 'really', 'be', 'crummy', 'just', 'level', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'case', 'here', 'think', 'large', 'number', 'low-star', 'reviews', 'here', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'just', 'were', 'disappointed', 'did', ""n't"", 'meet', 'high', 'expectations', 'reasons', 'angrily', 'dismissed', 'film', 'being', 'worse', 'hey', 'Internet', 'you.I', 'think', 'favorite', 'joke', 'whole', 'episode', 'was', 'Power', 'Station', 'gag', 'were', ""n't"", 'listening', 'rock', 'radio', 'mid', '1980', 'might', 'not', 'get', 'joke', 'show', 'over-40', 'adults', 'too', 'not', 'just', 'young', 'whippersnappers']",Family Guy: It's A Trap!

1370128,A27P0MW8TE1JQP,B003X4KHRG,Kevin J. Loria,"[1, 1]","Sadly ""It's a TRAP"" is the final Family Guy take on the original Star Wars Trilogy, concluding the Laugh it Up, Fuzzball Trilogy. According to creator Seth MacFarlane  ""It's a TRAP"" is to be the last of the Star Wars parodies as the Family Guy team feels the SW prequels are already animated enough (although Peter Griffin expects that the Cleveland Show will do them).  Return of the Jedi in their opinion, and most Star Wars fans, is the worst of the original Trilogy, so it stands to reason that the Family Guy parody of episode VI. should be the lesser of the animated spoofs.  I find that this isn't the case, although there is a disclaimer in the opening crawl to this effect, in actuality this outing is just a funny and irreverent as the rest of the Specials or the TV series for that matter, well maybe slightly less (see Penultimate paragraph below).  The story continues with the familiar characters from Quahog, Rhode Island retelling the story of Star Wars while portraying natural role assignments: Stewie as Vader, Peter as Han, Chris is Luke, Lois as Leia, Brian plays Chewy, Cleveland and Quagmire play R2 & CPO.  ""Darkside"" role pick-ups return with Carter Pewterschimidt ( as the Emperor and Carl the convenience store clerk is Yoda, Ernie the Giant Chicken returns as Boba Fett and Mort Goldman as Lando.  Great character cameos include characters from the Cleveland Show and American Dad like Klaus as Admiral Ackbar, Roger as imperial Moff Jerjerrod,  Tim as an Ewok and Rallo Tubbs, too. The guest star cameo list again include Rush Limbaugh, Patrick Stuart, Michael Dorn, Carrie Fisher, Anne Hathaway, Mary Hart and of course Mr. Conway Twitty.  The story naturally follows Return of the Jedi's premise,  Han's rescue from Jabba the Hutt and the mission against the new Deathstar begins, while Luke must confront Vader and the Emperor. Then the hilarity ensues as in the previous parodies. Especially notable scenes are the ""special edition"" CGI sockpuppet appearances and the Seth Green trashing finale.Of course, like ""Blue Harvest"" and ""Something, something Dark Side"" the Family Guy versions depend partly on at least passing pop culture, some Star Wars awareness and partly on an intricate knowledge of Star Wars. This isn't a complaint really, just a curious observation. For example is you haven't seen Return of the Jedi  in it's original non-special edition theater  or VHS format you may not get the Ewok song gags.  Great stuff no matter what, the only thing missing is the staple musical number, like Hebert's Ben Kenobi Dirty Dancing in "" Blue Harvest""  and Chris' Luke-Duet in ""Darkside."" This may be just as well as the later number, seemed forced, no pun intended.I hope this isn't the last of their straight to DVD parodies, as the series references Star Wars more than any other movies, it was a natural. But, trying to think of a series reference that runs close second, it could be the ""Back to the Future Trilogy"" ""Indiana Jones"" or ""Magnum P.I.""

Seth asks that the viewers lower their expectations and that the only reason ""Its a Trap!"" is being done is because Fox demanded it due to the success of the first 2 Family Guy Star Wars parodies.  Haha funny joke!  At least that is what I thought until the film was over, then I saw Seth really was being dead serious.  I was very disappointed that this was the way the trilogy was going to end, and even more sick to hear Peter suggest at the end that the Cleveland show would be doing episodes 1-3.Family Guy has been on a slow decline for a while now.  It seems the writers are spending no time, that they realize that they could smear s*** on cardboard and people would eat it up.  Most episodes are so loaded down with a liberal agenda that noone can stomach them.  Family Guy was supposed to be a fun, shock facter based adult cartoon, not a political statement. Let me make it clear that yes I am a conservative, however I don't mind political jokes aimed at ANY party and that is why I like American Dad it handles issues from both sides in a funny way.  Family Guy is just cramming politics down throats, either laugh at both points of view or not at all, but don't try to make every line Brian says propaganda.While I can say that ""Its a Trap!"" had its parts, it was nothing like I expected.  Never was there just a joke that made me fall out laughing.  Just as the Han panting scene in ""Darkside"" was taken overboard, there is a nodding scene in ""Trap"" that seems like it will NEVER end.  There is so much area to cover in Return of the Jedi, why waste time on a space filler?  Couldn't come up with anything better?  The characters were casted well (I liked seeing Roger from American Dad and the bear from Cleveland show), but there just wasn't a good script for them.  The jokes were sparse, and it really made it seem like they were just rushing to get this polished turd out and smile at the mass amount of preorder and midnight release sales they knew they would get.

1370133,ATP9LYGM6D3RO,B003X4KHRG,"McGillicutty ""DVD Fan""","[1, 1]","""It's a Trap"" is the third and final entry of the Family Guy Star Wars parodies. And it matches ""Return of the Jedi"" in two respects, it's both the most spectacular in terms of visual effects and the least of the three films in it's storyline or ""comedic"" effort.If you've seen ""Return of the Jedi"", you know the plot so I won't delve too deeply into that. The opening paragraph warns us not to expect a whole lot and unfortunately the effort lives up to that promise. Pretty much, Han Solo (Peter) is still trapped in carbonite and released by Princess Leah (Lois). A few gags are priceless such as the overlong ""nod"" scene before Luke Skywalker (Chris) is to be thrown into the monster (Meg), the brief appearence of ""Darth Twitty"", and any scene with Family Guy's best creation, Darth Vader (Stewie).Plenty of curses are thrown about to punch up the ""comedy"", coming mostly from the Emporer (Carter Pewterschmit). And the most interesting guest ""voice"" comes from Carrie Fisher who plays the only woman other than Leah in the entire Star Wars universe it seems.Probably the best aspect of this feature is it's spectacular look. The planets, ships, and even the characters have never looked better. The detail and color of the ""Emporer's Chamber"" aboard the Death Star is the most impressive, at times looking almost ""real"".Extras include a short, somewhat funny bit by ""Darth Stewie"". A brief outtake section featuring a sock puppet (one of the funnier bits in ""It's a Trap""), a so-so ""making of..."" scene which mirrors the audio commentary from what sounds like a bunch of worn-out members of the ""Family Guy"" staff. Heck, Seth McFarland walks out halfway through for no particular reason it seems. The only bright spot is a Star Wars Trivial Pursuit match between four members of the Family Guy staff. It's not so much the thirty minutes of watching folks playing Trivial Pursuit, but just the audacity of putting such a feature in a DVD makes it the most bold inclusion in an otherwise mundane set of extras.What began as an inspired take on ""Star Wars"" has worn its way down to this tired effort. It shows how much of a toll producing three series (""Family Guy"", ""The Cleveland Show"" and ""American Dad"") have been on this crew. And while one of the producers in the commentary joked about doing ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan"", it might be better if they dumped a series or two first (starting with ""Cleveland""...please) before trying something else.",3,Well...we're waiting!,1293580800,"12 29, 2010",2010,2459,"['Trap', 'third', 'final', 'entry', 'Family', 'Guy', 'Star', 'Wars', 'parodies', 'Return', 'Jedi', 'two', 'respects', 'most', 'spectacular', 'terms', 'visual', 'effects', 'least', 'three', 'films', 'storyline', 'comedic', 'effort.If', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Return', 'Jedi', 'know', 'plot', 'wo', ""n't"", 'delve', 'too', 'deeply', 'opening', 'paragraph', 'not', 'expect', 'whole', 'lot', 'unfortunately', 'effort', 'up', 'promise', 'Pretty', 'much', 'Han', 'Solo', 'Peter', 'still', 'trapped', 'carbonite', 'released', 'Princess', 'Leah', 'Lois', 'few', 'gags', 'are', 'priceless', 'such', 'overlong', 'nod', 'scene', 'Luke', 'Skywalker', 'Chris', 'be', 'thrown', 'monster', 'Meg', 'brief', 'appearence', 'Darth', 'Twitty', 'scene', 'Family', 'Guy', 'best', 'creation', 'Darth', 'Vader', 'Stewie', '.Plenty', 'curses', 'are', 'thrown', 'punch', 'up', 'comedy', 'coming', 'mostly', 'Emporer', 'Carter', 'Pewterschmit', 'most', 'interesting', 'guest', 'voice', 'Carrie', 'Fisher', 'who', 'only', 'woman', 'other', 'Leah', 'entire', 'Star', 'Wars', 'seems.Probably', 'best', 'aspect', 'feature', 'spectacular', 'look', 'planets', 'ships', 'even', 'characters', 'have', 'never', 'looked', 'better', 'detail', 'color', 'Emporer', 'Chamber', 'Death', 'Star', 'most', 'impressive', 'times', 'looking', 'almost', 'real', '.Extras', 'include', 'short', 'somewhat', 'funny', 'bit', 'Darth', 'Stewie', 'brief', 'outtake', 'section', 'featuring', 'sock', 'puppet', 'one', 'funnier', 'bits', 'Trap', 'so-so', 'making', 'scene', 'audio', 'commentary', 'what', 'bunch', 'worn-out', 'members', 'Family', 'Guy', 'staff', 'Heck', 'Seth', 'McFarland', 'out', 'halfway', 'particular', 'reason', 'only', 'bright', 'spot', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Trivial', 'Pursuit', 'match', 'four', 'members', 'Family', 'Guy', 'staff', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'watching', 'folks', 'playing', 'Trivial', 'Pursuit', 'just', 'audacity', 'putting', 'such', 'feature', 'DVD', 'most', 'bold', 'inclusion', 'otherwise', 'mundane', 'set', 'extras.What', 'began', 'inspired', 'take', 'Star', 'Wars', 'worn', 'way', 'tired', 'effort', 'how', 'much', 'toll', 'producing', 'three', 'series', 'Family', 'Guy', 'Cleveland', 'Show', 'American', 'Dad', 'have', 'been', 'crew', 'one', 'producers', 'commentary', 'joked', 'doing', 'Star', 'Trek', 'II', 'Wrath', 'Khan', 'might', 'be', 'better', 'dumped', 'series', 'two', 'first', 'starting', 'Cleveland', 'please', 'trying', 'something', 'else']",Family Guy: It's A Trap!

Return of the Jedi is so bad in some areas that this parody is actually an improvement to it.The DVD commentary is terrible...I expected to hear where some of the funny ideas came from, but they just compliment each other on the coloring, lighting, and effects, and hardly acknowledge the jokes.Highly recommended for Star Wars and/or Family Guy fans!",4,Very funny parody of a movie that deserves a roasting,1293148800,"12 24, 2010",2010,1004,"['Return', 'Jedi', 'movie', 'can', 'easily', 'get', 'mercilessly', 'bashed', 'parody', 'Family', 'Guy', 'guys', 'actually', 'went', 'easy', 'movie', 'really', 'funny', 'exceptionally', 'hilarious', 'scenes', 'giving', 'signal', 'Luke', 'lightsaber', 'Sarlaac', 'pit', 'flying', 'casual', 'part', 'speeder', 'bike', 'chase', 'Emperor', 'passing', 'gas', 'Emperor', 'line', 'Oh', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'shield', 'generator', 'will', 'be', 'quite', 'operational', 'when', 'friends', 'arrive', 'Overall', 'reproduction', 'movie', 'especially', 'space', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'Family', 'Guy', 'Star', 'Wars', 'parodies', 'are', 'funny', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'one', 'Return', 'Jedi', 'so', 'bad', 'areas', 'parody', 'actually', 'improvement', 'it.The', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'terrible', 'expected', 'hear', 'where', 'funny', 'ideas', 'came', 'just', 'compliment', 'other', 'coloring', 'lighting', 'effects', 'hardly', 'acknowledge', 'jokes.Highly', 'recommended', 'Star', 'Wars', 'and/or', 'Family', 'Guy', 'fans']",Family Guy: It's A Trap!

It is the absolute truth and it's even admitted to by Seth McFarlane in the commentary, and it's apparent from the first joke.""It's a Trap!"" is boring and unfunny for the most part and generally predictable and nowhere near as good as ""Blue Harvest"" or ""Something, Something, Something Darkside"" (with ""Blue Harvest"" being the best).  There is one truly hilarious scene in the film but that's it.  The rest is pretty much a waste of time from a comedy standpoint and what's going to be disappointing is that this is that is going to be this season's season finale because that's what they've been doing with these direct-to-video movies for the last four years.  It's really a shame because, ""It's a Trap!"" is going to tarnish what has been the best season of ""Family Guy"" since the relaunch.  This episode seem more suited to second or third season post-relaunch with the unfunny jokes and jokes that just got dragged on forever.  If you need any further proof of how bad this is or how the writers mailed it in, they threw in a Conway Twitty scene... again.The only reason it's getting two stars instead of one is because the special features are pretty decent (the commentary is funnier than the film) and the animation is fantastic.  This is the first of the ""Family Guy"" Star Wars spoofs to be produced in 16:9 and it is visually stunning.Unless you are a die-hard ""Family Guy"" fan and you must have this, I wouldn't recommend it.  the only reason I purchased the trilogy is because I needed the ""Blue Harvest"" Blu-Ray and the trilogy was just $4.00 more than just the one film.",2,Talk about mailing it in...,1293494400,"12 28, 2010",2010,1889,"['opening', 'scrolling', 'text', 'sequence', 'beginning', 'Trap', 'writers', 'tell', 'tale', 'how', 'literally', 'put', 'effort', 'writing', 'were', 'so', 'exhausted', 'having', 'done', 'Something', 'Something', 'Something', 'Darkside', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'not', 'joke', 'absolute', 'truth', 'even', 'admitted', 'Seth', 'McFarlane', 'commentary', 'apparent', 'first', 'joke', 'Trap', 'boring', 'unfunny', 'most', 'part', 'generally', 'predictable', 'nowhere', 'as', 'good', 'Blue', 'Harvest', 'Something', 'Something', 'Something', 'Darkside', 'Blue', 'Harvest', 'being', 'best', 'one', 'truly', 'hilarious', 'scene', 'film', 'rest', 'pretty', 'much', 'waste', 'time', 'comedy', 'standpoint', 'what', 'going', 'be', 'disappointing', 'going', 'be', 'season', 'season', 'finale', 'what', ""'ve"", 'been', 'doing', 'direct-to-video', 'movies', 'last', 'four', 'years', 'really', 'shame', 'Trap', 'going', 'tarnish', 'what', 'been', 'best', 'season', 'Family', 'Guy', 'relaunch', 'episode', 'seem', 'more', 'suited', 'second', 'third', 'season', 'post-relaunch', 'unfunny', 'jokes', 'jokes', 'just', 'got', 'dragged', 'forever', 'need', 'further', 'proof', 'how', 'bad', 'how', 'writers', 'mailed', 'threw', 'Conway', 'Twitty', 'scene', 'only', 'reason', 'getting', 'two', 'stars', 'instead', 'one', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'pretty', 'decent', 'commentary', 'funnier', 'film', 'animation', 'fantastic', 'first', 'Family', 'Guy', 'Star', 'Wars', 'spoofs', 'be', 'produced', '16:9', 'visually', 'stunning.Unless', 'are', 'die-hard', 'Family', 'Guy', 'fan', 'must', 'have', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'only', 'reason', 'purchased', 'trilogy', 'needed', 'Blue', 'Harvest', 'Blu-Ray', 'trilogy', 'was', 'just', '4.00', 'more', 'just', 'one', 'film']",Family Guy: It's A Trap!

Once again the power goes out and the Griffin family reluctantly tells the story of  RETURN OF THE JEDI, but with a FAMILY GUY twist. All three of the FAMILY GUY Star Wars parodies follow the basic overall plot of the original movies. However, IT'S A TRAP! sticks even closer to the source material. That's not to say that it's not funny, because it is. It's just that sometimes it takes a long time for the payoff to a joke and there just aren't as many as there were in the first two parodies. The biggest difference between IT'S A TRAP and the previous parodies is that several of the newer characters are played by characters from other MacFarlane shows, such as THE CLEVELAND SHOW and AMERICAN DAD. Overall, IT'S A TRAP is a great wrap-up to the FAMILY GUY Star Wars trilogy re-tellings.Note: it's amazing how many people have rated IT'S A TRAP! negatively simply because of the opening crawl. MacFarlane put just as much effort into IT'S A TRAP as he did the other two re-tellings. The opening crawl is a joke. I'm not really a fan of FAMILY GUY, but even I got the whole &#34;the entire opening crawl is one big joke.&#34;",4,The FAMILY GUY Version of Star Wars Concludes,1396656000,"04 5, 2014",2014,1211,"['FAMILY', 'GUY', 'parody', 'original', 'Star', 'Wars', 'trilogy', 'IT', 'A', 'TRAP', 'Once', 'again', 'power', 'out', 'Griffin', 'family', 'reluctantly', 'story', 'RETURN', 'THE', 'JEDI', 'FAMILY', 'GUY', 'twist', 'three', 'FAMILY', 'GUY', 'Star', 'Wars', 'follow', 'basic', 'overall', 'plot', 'original', 'movies', 'However', 'IT', 'A', 'TRAP', 'sticks', 'even', 'closer', 'source', 'material', 'not', 'say', 'not', 'funny', 'just', 'long', 'time', 'payoff', 'joke', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'many', 'were', 'first', 'two', 'parodies', 'biggest', 'difference', 'IT', 'A', 'TRAP', 'previous', 'parodies', 'several', 'newer', 'characters', 'are', 'played', 'characters', 'other', 'MacFarlane', 'shows', 'such', 'CLEVELAND', 'SHOW', 'AMERICAN', 'DAD', 'Overall', 'IT', 'A', 'TRAP', 'great', 'wrap-up', 'FAMILY', 'GUY', 'Star', 'Wars', 'trilogy', 're-tellings.Note', 'amazing', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'rated', 'IT', 'A', 'TRAP', 'negatively', 'simply', 'opening', 'crawl', 'MacFarlane', 'put', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'effort', 'IT', 'A', 'TRAP', 'did', 'other', 'two', 're-tellings', 'opening', 'crawl', 'joke', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'fan', 'FAMILY', 'GUY', 'even', 'got', 'whole', '34', 'entire', 'opening', 'crawl', 'one', 'big', 'joke.', '34']",Family Guy: It's A Trap!

The same old Family Guy characters and jokes and pop culture references galore.

Upon viewing, it is clear that perhaps it wasn't a joke after all.This time, Seth McFarland and crew take on the heavy-spoofing of ""Return of the Jedi"".  It's typical Family Guy through and through, with cut-away gags and jokes that go on just a bit too long.  Underlying the whole joke-set this time around, though, seems to be a sort of disdain for ""Jedi"".  Whereas ""Blue Harvest"" was made out of reverence and ""Dark Side"" was made out of necessity, this one seems to be just a labor to finish the trilogy and nothing more.  A few jokes are hilarious, while the others are all over the place and considerably less than funny.Thus, while this installment needed to be made to complete the trilogy, it suffers from a severe lack of punch in terms of writing.
