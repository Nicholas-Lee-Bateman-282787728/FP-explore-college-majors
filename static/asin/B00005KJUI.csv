I thought All Growed Up Was great it was much better than the Rugrats Movie which was a little disappointing and I was really bored watching it and was glad when it was over but All Growed Up is a lot of fun to watch and I could definitely watch this again.,4,It Was Good!,1020297600,"05 2, 2002",2002,329,"[""'m"", 'big', 'Rugrats', 'fan', 'favorite', 'characters', 'are', 'Tommy', 'Chuckie', 'thought', 'Growed', 'Up', 'Was', 'great', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'Rugrats', 'Movie', 'was', 'little', 'disappointing', 'was', 'really', 'bored', 'watching', 'was', 'glad', 'when', 'was', 'Growed', 'Up', 'lot', 'fun', 'watch', 'could', 'definitely', 'watch', 'again']",N/A

It's about the Rugrats 10 Years older. Kimi Looked great as her Growed-up self, It was shocking to see the medallion ending up in the sandbox rather than in Spike. Susie and Tommy almost didn't go to the Emica cocert, but Susie Decided to go with the other Rugrats even though she had to babysit Tommy so he could prove his Dad's medallion wasn't gone after all! YAY! The song &quot;You're a Friend To Me&quot;(Sung by Emica with Older Angelica and Tommy) sounds like it was written for Pokemon(the American Version)! Enjoy it!

662403,A2NLDZ1ISQV2Z7,B00005KJUI,Grace,"[5, 5]","Being an avid Rugrats fan for many years, I was really excited to see this episode. It was excellent. What a sight it was to see these characters who have been babies for all these years advance to teenagers! I personally liked seeing Tommy, Chuckie, Phil, Lil, Kimmy, Susie, Dill, and Angelica as older kids because they've been babies for soooo long, and sometimes you just find yourself wondering what it would be like if they were teenagers. I hope they have more episodes like this one, because it was, in my opinion, very good.Angelica is bossier than ever, only now she just blows the other kids off a little more and rolls her eyes at everything they do. She is only interested in them when she sees what good they can do for her, just like always.Tommy continues to be the leader of the pack; strong, bold, courageous, and a very sweet friend to Chuckie and Phil and Lil. And he grew hair, too!!!!! With that blue hair and that sly smile, he looks exactly like his father, Stu Pickles.Think that Chuckie got over his fears once he hit his teen years? Wrong! The sweet, lovable Chuckie is still shy, insecure, and nervous about almost everything. When he becomes interested in Angelica's best friend, he is forced to open up and let his emotions show. He still has the wild red hair and the shoes that are always untied, proving that he is still the endearing Chuckie Finster that we all know and love.Phil and Lil......let's say they haven't changed that much. They're still cute, gross, and laugh-out-loud hilarious, and as always, you never know what they're gonna do next. It's impossible not to love this pair of active and adorable twins.Kimmy has not been around very long, as she just started to appear after &quot;Rugrats in Paris&quot; was made, but seeing her as a teenager is equally entertaining. She's brave, active, and easily excited.Lastly, there's little Susie, who's not so little anymore. She's still that wonderful older influence on Tommy, Chuckie, Kimmy, Phil and Lil, and she continues to be Angelica's biggest competition.Little Dill is a lot better now that he can actually talk and be a bigger part of the group. He's still capable of sticking up to Angelica, even in the rough teenage years.All the grown-ups (the parents of the kids) are the same--it's the little ones who have done all the changing. They may be a little bigger, but their personalities and their values are pretty much the same. If you want to see a big jump from the babies in &quot;diapies&quot; that you've seen on the show, I highly recommend &quot;Rugrats: All Growed Up.&quot; It's a funny, entertaining video that you're sure to love!

It's nice to see what the Rugrats look like ""all growed up.""

662405,A2RN2AO4BE6F4K,B00005KJUI,"Scott Bright ""scottypotty""","[3, 3]","Movie Summary:  Tommy and the gang are all fed up with Angelica bossing them around and being mean to them. They can't wait until they are &quot;all growed up&quot; so they don't have to listen to her any more. In the middle of a big fight with Angelica over her new tapioki machine, Tommy is forced to create a time machine like they saw on TV so that they can get away from her. The time machine works and the Rugrats are thrown 10 years into the future.My Opinion:  Our entire family enjoyed this one as we do all the Rugrats features. This double long episode was touted for weeks on Nickelodeon and it definitely lives up to the hype. We get to see the entire cast 10 years older. Both Tommy and Dill have hair! Chuckie has braces and a crush on a girl at school. The plot is a good one with good boy Tommy getting in trouble for something Angelica forces him into. Like all the Rugrats cartoons, there are things for the adults and the kids. In my opinion, this is what makes the Rugrats great. It has jokes for the adults and plots that the kids can follow and enjoy as well.What You Should Do:  See it, Buy it, and wear the tape out! This is a great one worth having if you have a Rugrats fan in the house. It's good clean intelligent fun for the entire family.Related Movies To Check Out: Rugrats - Runaway Reptar, Rugrats in Paris - The Movie, The Rugrats Movie",5,Still Awesome Baby After All These Years!,995846400,"07 23, 2001",2001,1371,"['Movie', 'Summary', 'Tommy', 'gang', 'are', 'fed', 'up', 'Angelica', 'bossing', 'around', 'being', 'mean', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'are', 'quot', 'growed', 'up', 'quot', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'listen', 'more', 'middle', 'big', 'fight', 'Angelica', 'new', 'tapioki', 'machine', 'Tommy', 'forced', 'create', 'time', 'machine', 'saw', 'TV', 'can', 'get', 'away', 'time', 'machine', 'works', 'Rugrats', 'are', 'thrown', '10', 'years', 'future.My', 'Opinion', 'entire', 'family', 'enjoyed', 'one', 'do', 'Rugrats', 'features', 'double', 'long', 'episode', 'was', 'touted', 'weeks', 'Nickelodeon', 'definitely', 'up', 'hype', 'get', 'see', 'entire', 'cast', '10', 'years', 'older', 'Tommy', 'Dill', 'have', 'hair', 'Chuckie', 'braces', 'crush', 'girl', 'school', 'plot', 'good', 'one', 'good', 'boy', 'Tommy', 'getting', 'trouble', 'something', 'Angelica', 'Rugrats', 'cartoons', 'are', 'things', 'adults', 'kids', 'opinion', 'Rugrats', 'great', 'jokes', 'adults', 'plots', 'kids', 'can', 'follow', 'enjoy', 'Should', 'Do', 'See', 'Buy', 'tape', 'out', 'great', 'one', 'worth', 'having', 'have', 'Rugrats', 'fan', 'house', 'good', 'clean', 'intelligent', 'fun', 'entire', 'family.Related', 'Movies', 'Check', 'Out', 'Rugrats', 'Runaway', 'Reptar', 'Rugrats', 'Paris', 'Movie', 'Rugrats', 'Movie']",N/A
662406,A2JPOGEC5H4T8I,B00005KJUI,"""xxlessthanfishxx""","[2, 2]","Definately my favorite Rugrats episode. Tommy is and his worrywart best friend chuckie and the rest are back 10 years older. After Angelica tells her unsurprising best friend she has the exact same necklace as teenage sensation &quot;Emica&quot; the only way to hook up Chuckie to Angelica's best friend (Chuckies crush) is to steal his dads necklace which happens to be the same design as Emica's necklace, but unfortinate events happen and Tommy is going through alot more trouble then he thought. I wish the would have released this on DVD along with &quot;Rugrats-Still Babies after all these years&quot;, a look back on America's favorite babies, kind of a Tenth anniversary DVD. Also on the DVD should be a couple of best-loved episodes, but I can only hope.
