1086727,A59NEDTG1DHG7,B000SM6FJK,Addicted2Amazon!,"[1, 1]","The Firm's TBTC is a fun and very effective workout that alternates cardio and fast-paced sculpting  with  weights.  As with most of The Firms' recent workouts, I LOVE this one! Here's why: From beginning to end, the program is fast-paced, challenging, rewarding (i.e. results!) and FUN!TBTC begins with a brisk 5-min. warm-up that does a decent job of both warming up your muscles and stretching you out (I especially like that very first move, the cross punch...I love feeling that in my waist!)The program then alternates a sculpting segment followed by a cardio segment. It repeats this a total of 3 times.  The cardio is fun and will get you SWEATING!  It is not dance-y at all, but neither is it bootcamp-like in its intensity (no tire drills, jump-rope or any of the dreaded burpees here).  It is more on the higher impact side, however. The 1st cardio segment (probably my favorite) consists of one-legged hops from side to side, one-sided jacks, and has a very fun hamstring curl variation that I can't really describe, you kinda just have to see it.  I LOVE that one! The 2nd cardio segment is probably the most intense, beginning with this ""Superman-like"" move where you jump off the ground and then lunge back with one fist out in front of you...Between that move and the plyo jumps, you will be panting by the time you get to the end! The third and final cardio segment is probably no more intense than the 1st, but it feels a lot harder b/c you're already fatigued! It consists of a plyo move called ""squat switch"", some jumping lunges and a little bit of kickboxing moves towards the end.The sculpting, though definitely a rest from the cardio, is no piece of cake either! Again, there are 3 segments, interspersed among the cardio, and most of them are in The Firm's signature 4-limb style: i.e. lower body doing some sort of squat/lunge combo and upper body wielding weights.Very effective and a lil bit challenging. And fun!Following the last cardio, you move to the floor for some brief upper body and ab work.  I found the ab work okay, definitely not the best, but certainly better than nothing. After all, you can always find a 10 min. add-on (Star Trainer's Ab Blast and 10 Minute Solutions Blast Off the Belly Fat are both awesome...).And then there's the final stretch. It's awesome! It's not too hurried, like in many programs. It's pretty thorough and set to this very relaxing Spanish guitar-sounding track.And speaking of: I really like the music in this one. Upbeat and pop-sounding as opposed to the generic techno beat that is in many workout DVDs. As a matter of fact, I can't help but shake my butt a lil bit in that first sculpting segment when the beat kicks in!The instructor, Rebekah, is great. Inspiring, energetic and knowledgeable.Also, this particular DVD (some of The Firm's DVDs have this, most don't) has a bonus tutorial which explains correct form on many of their squats, weight lifts, lunges, etc. so that you won't hurt yourself and will get the most out of your workout. Excellent for those new to exercise. (There also are beginner modifications throughout the program.)All in all, I think this a great fitness DVD and packs a lot of good stuff in 45 minutes! Highly recommended!(FYI: If you would like to see a clip of this, The Firm's website has a clip under ""Store."")",4,One of the BEST Things You Can Do for Your Body in 45 Minutes!,1235347200,"02 23, 2009",2009,3323,"['Firm', 'TBTC', 'fun', 'very', 'effective', 'workout', 'cardio', 'fast-paced', 'sculpting', 'weights', 'most', 'Firms', 'recent', 'workouts', 'LOVE', 'one', 'Here', 'why', 'From', 'beginning', 'end', 'program', 'fast-paced', 'challenging', 'rewarding', 'i.e', 'results', 'FUN', 'TBTC', 'brisk', '5-min', 'warm-up', 'decent', 'job', 'warming', 'up', 'muscles', 'stretching', 'especially', 'very', 'first', 'move', 'cross', 'punch', 'love', 'feeling', 'waist', 'program', 'then', 'sculpting', 'segment', 'followed', 'cardio', 'segment', 'total', '3', 'times', 'cardio', 'fun', 'will', 'get', 'SWEATING', 'not', 'dance-y', 'bootcamp-like', 'intensity', 'tire', 'jump-rope', 'dreaded', 'burpees', 'here', 'more', 'higher', 'impact', 'side', 'however', '1st', 'cardio', 'segment', 'probably', 'favorite', 'one-legged', 'hops', 'side', 'side', 'one-sided', 'jacks', 'very', 'fun', 'hamstring', 'curl', 'variation', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'describe', 'kinda', 'just', 'have', 'see', 'LOVE', 'one', '2nd', 'cardio', 'segment', 'probably', 'most', 'intense', 'beginning', 'Superman-like', 'move', 'where', 'jump', 'ground', 'then', 'lunge', 'back', 'one', 'fist', 'front', 'Between', 'move', 'plyo', 'jumps', 'will', 'be', 'panting', 'time', 'get', 'end', 'third', 'final', 'cardio', 'segment', 'probably', 'more', 'intense', '1st', 'lot', 'harder', 'b/c', ""'re"", 'already', 'fatigued', 'plyo', 'move', 'called', 'squat', 'switch', 'jumping', 'lunges', 'little', 'bit', 'kickboxing', 'moves', 'end.The', 'sculpting', 'though', 'definitely', 'rest', 'cardio', 'piece', 'cake', 'Again', 'are', '3', 'segments', 'interspersed', 'cardio', 'most', 'are', 'Firm', 'signature', '4-limb', 'style', 'i.e', 'lower', 'body', 'doing', 'sort', 'squat/lunge', 'combo', 'upper', 'body', 'wielding', 'weights.Very', 'effective', 'lil', 'bit', 'challenging', 'fun', 'Following', 'last', 'cardio', 'move', 'floor', 'brief', 'upper', 'body', 'ab', 'work', 'found', 'ab', 'work', 'okay', 'definitely', 'not', 'best', 'certainly', 'better', 'nothing', 'can', 'always', 'find', '10', 'min', 'add-on', 'Star', 'Trainer', 'Ab', 'Blast', '10', 'Minute', 'Solutions', 'Blast', 'Belly', 'Fat', 'are', 'awesome', '.And', 'then', 'final', 'stretch', 'awesome', 'not', 'too', 'hurried', 'many', 'programs', 'pretty', 'thorough', 'set', 'very', 'relaxing', 'Spanish', 'guitar-sounding', 'track.And', 'speaking', 'really', 'music', 'one', 'Upbeat', 'pop-sounding', 'opposed', 'generic', 'techno', 'beat', 'many', 'workout', 'DVDs', 'matter', 'fact', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'shake', 'butt', 'lil', 'bit', 'first', 'sculpting', 'segment', 'when', 'beat', 'kicks', 'instructor', 'Rebekah', 'great', 'Inspiring', 'energetic', 'knowledgeable.Also', 'particular', 'DVD', 'Firm', 'DVDs', 'have', 'most', 'do', ""n't"", 'bonus', 'tutorial', 'correct', 'form', 'many', 'squats', 'weight', 'lifts', 'lunges', 'etc', 'wo', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'will', 'get', 'most', 'workout', 'Excellent', 'new', 'exercise', 'also', 'are', 'beginner', 'modifications', 'program', 'think', 'great', 'fitness', 'DVD', 'lot', 'good', 'stuff', '45', 'minutes', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'FYI', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'clip', 'Firm', 'website', 'clip', 'Store']",The Firm: Total Body Time-Crunch

I can attribute some of the cueing issues to her being relatively new to the lead position on a DVD workout. The cueing was a little late and one segment in particular was fast(in my opinion) and hard to follow the first time I worked out with this DVD, but I have no doubt that I will have it down by the 2nd or 3rd time. It is no more hard to follow than the dance moves in the 3rd cardio segment of Alison's Cardio Boot Camp.

Secondly, when I did pause the DVD to get in the right position for the move (which I had to do every 2 seconds it seemed), the move wasn't challenging.

Most of the new firms are not as tough as previous ones that utilize the fanny lifter or the transfirmer but I do like not having to use a step everytime I workout. I think the new firms are really fun and good for beginners once they learn the moves and more intermediate to advanced exercisers can use higher weights and pair with another workout and get great results while having fun.

The first ten minutes do provide a good warm-up and some fun introductory steps. As the video progresses, however, what began as a pleasant challenge becomes increasingly frustrating and no longer enjoyable. There is an increasing number of single moves that alternate from side to side quickly, and the cuing is poor.I gave this one 3 stars because I think that the risk of injury is even higher here than it is in some of the other fast-paced Firm workouts. Lunges are particulary risky moves even under the best of circumstances; many people injure their knees while lunging. This DVD rushes you through both forward lunges and side to side lunges, both of which should be done carefully and with perfect form in order to avoid injury.Even on my best days, I don't make it through this workout unless I modify it quite a bit during the second half. I do it at a slower pace, or repeat some moves more while eliminating others altogether.

1086754,A39MD3N21Z8OUU,B000SM6FJK,The Mrs.,"[4, 4]","I have recently purchased 95% of the TransFirmation DVDs, aka ""Firm Pinks"" and I have to say these are some of the best DVDs on the market. I have a Fitness DVD collection of over 500 and I have finally gotten to the point were I have found something that is effective, fun, offers minimal equipment, and gets you in/out in shorter time compared to other systems that offer both cardio and strength in 1 workout.Total Body Time Crunch is approx 45 Minutes in length, about 47 due to the extend stretching. You have 3 cycles of both cardio and strength, starting with cardio/warmup and ending with strength on the floor. According to Fitness DVD websites, this workout is rated anywhere from Intermediate/Advanced to straight Advanced. I will say that this feels more along the combination of Intermediate/Advanced. It recommends starting out 3, 5, & 8 lbs dumbbells, and beginners, no weights. I have been lifting weights for sometime and I am familar with the Firm so I decided to up my selection to 4s (bad shoulder), 8s and 10s. 8s or my ""Medium Weight-according to Firm Instruction"" were used most often. Now for people who feel this isn't advanced enough due to the strength element alone, you NEED to use heavier weights for MAXIMUM results!! I have just started back to exercise after almost 7 months off and had been using 3s, 5s, & 8s like in the DVD, but wasn't finding the challenge for most muscle groups. Upping the weights even just slightly made all the difference in the World! I am hoping to up the weight selection again in another 2-3 weeks. For those concerned with the ""Bulk"" myth, I found out today directly from Firm Master Instructor herself (answered an email), that she, Allison, uses 8s and 10s as her low weight for most Firm Workouts and up to 20-25 lbs for larger groups like legs, back, and chest!!! If you see Allison in these DVDs, she's firm and tight, not bulky! I can't even lift that doing the Cardio-Weight workouts; that's incredible!As far as the Cardio goes in this one, it will take 2-3 run thrus to get it completely. It's not dancy IMO, I hate Dance DVDs, but it's not basic either. If you've done the Fanny Lifter DVDs, which is my Firm Background, it's more complex than that, but not by leaps and bounds. It't taught in add-on style so a new move is added about every minute, min/half during the cardio cycles, practiced a few times and the cycle is over. It varies anywhere from power squats to side steps, side steps with leg lifts or knee lifts, kickboxing-lite, 4 limb, ect.If you are a true advanced exerciser doing Cathe Friedrich or Amy Bento on a regular basis, this will be rated intermediate for you. If however you are a Firmy, Inter/Advanced, and Non-Firmie, Non-Strength person, Advanced. I actually got this and another ""solid-Intermediate"" DVD mixed up this morning when working out; I thought I was doing the less-intense of the two. Turns out I did the more advanced DVD and I loved every minute of it. With the heavier weights my muscles felt it like they haven't in prior Firm Pink workouts, my fault not theirs, and I am excited to try more and do this one more often. This is a great buy! While the reps are not long or muscles groups repeated except for the leg work (different types of exercises for the same muscle group) and Chest, I felt I got a perfect weight workout. I used heavy enough weight that by the time we were doing the last 2 reps, my arms were going to fall off in revolt. Now that's how you know you've picked the right weight! Not so heavy you will hurt yourself, but heavy enough you feel like you can't do another rep when the set is finished.Again, 3 cycles of cardio and strength, each cycle lasting about 5 minutes each. This DVD offers a 25 Minute Express Option, wonderful I am sure, so 2 workouts on 1 DVD. Rebekah is an excellent lead, perhaps my favorite now, and her cueing is spot on! The music is typical Firm style, but I actually liked it in this workout. No complaints!

I love the firm I have some of their old dvds the one with the stepper and I have to admit I didn't enjoy that half as much as the Transformation.

I lost one pound in one week and please remember to follow a healthy diet this is a plus, Enjoy this workout as well as others by the firm.

I haven't done it but twice but it's so fast paced with so many different moves to learn it's a little disappointing. Hopefully in time I can follow along and not be lost.
