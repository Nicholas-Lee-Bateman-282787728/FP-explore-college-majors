Their boss needs these two men to find out about  killings in the gay communty.The two partners as played by Ryan O' Neal(The  Main Even) and John Hurt(Rob Roy,King Ralph).The partners go live in  the gay community to find the killer. They befriend some gays , start  putting the pieces together. One of the cops(O'Neal) poses for a gay  magazine and befriends the gril in charges of the magazine.This in too  almost blows the two partners cover. John Hurt tells the boss but the boss  tells him to not bother him. The suspense build up as the two partners find  out who the killer is. The ending is sad for a comedy(one of the partners  is shot and killed).

211139,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,6300214168,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[7, 7]","PARTNERS (1982) is a movie I'd never heard of, let alone seen any part of, but it's a fun ""gay cop"" comedy, in a way you'd never expect. Ryan O'Neal is Sgt. Benson, assigned to go undercover to catch a serial killer who's been bumping off gay male porno models in California.He's assigned to live and work with Kerwin (a young and hilarious John Hurt), an openly gay police department clerk who knows the scene. While Hurt gives a comically sensitive performance, O'Neal really shines as the good sport who ""almost"" turns gay by default. Living with Kerwin in deep cover, Sgt. Benson starts to treat Kerwin like...well, like a boyfriend. I guess that graduates to treating him like a girlfriend when he absentmindedly pecks Kerwin on the cheek--the look on both their faces alone makes this movie well worth it.Of course they do eventually solve the gay male model murders, but I won't spoil that part. I prefer to emphasize the importance of this modest little comedy on a grand scale.1982, which I recall oh-so-terribly, was a weird year in film. Recall that it was before the media scare that kicked off the AIDS ""crisis""--society's goodwill toward the gay community was going in a very different direction than today, and this film shows it clearly. Kerwin's and Benson's boss, Chief Wilkins (the great bit player Kenneth McMillan), treats Kerwin like an indulgent uncle might do. He also chuckles at the growing friendship between Benson and Kerwin.In most films, the cops are violently smashing their way through gay people's lives, and this far back in time there were no gay characters to speak of; the cops violently smash the gay community in real life even worse.1982's big hits in film counted among them BLADE RUNNER, E.T., GANDHI, POLTERGEIST, TOOTSIE (more of the typical gay-mocking film if you ask me) and VICTOR VICTORIA (quite great, except I think Blake Edwards probably should not have directed). PARTNERS didn't stand a chance. With O'Neal pretty much on the wane and John Hurt not yet the legend he is today, well....It's AIDS that really hurt this movie and another similar to it I can recall, the immortal TORCH SONG TRILOGY (1988, but set in 1982). While I was there for the premiere of TORCH SONG, and saw VICTOR VICTORIA as soon as I could, I never saw PARTNERS until today. Sad.That huge box office explosion in '82 left PARTNERS panting and not in a good way. Furthermore, it was the only ""mainstream"" gay-themed film you could have seen back then, unless you were lucky enough to catch LA CAGE AUX FOLLES (1978) or VICTOR VICTORIA.AN EARLY FROST (1985) and VICTOR VICTORIA was all there was besides TORCH SONG. At least Fierstein spared us the AIDS topic by setting TORCH SONG in the time when PARTNERS was screened.There is no way you can ignore this DVD if you are even remotely interested in the subject matter. It is a bit ahead of its time with the bits of raunchy comedy--which are perfectly timed and executed--and the soundtrack is surprisingly contempo. Deborah Harry's music certainly didn't miss its chance in this film.Get it and look at what the pre-AIDS, light side of gay life was really like for those of us who lived it.

It did not insult me in 1982 when I saw it in the theater and it did not insult even less in 2012 when I watched it again on DVD.  As if overlooking the obvious gay friendly and homophobic humor of the plot of two police officers thrown together to crack a case of murder in the gay community.  Probably aiding to my ability to overlook what could have been insulting as the script sometimes can not help using anti-gay slanted jokes as the script was written by Francis Veber, who helped pen the original ""La Cage Aux Folles"" and it becomes understandable that we must suffer only to be vindicated as that hit, that milestone, depended upon audiences that would appreciate the deprecating of the gay as a source of its own humor.  And ""Partners"" swings the other way quite fully to be filled with gay friendly situations and gay positive motivation.  And even the beefcake has an air of the question about it as ultimately Ryan O'Neal in the buff is somewhat more like a cherub.  It is now brought out on DVD for the first time by Legend Films and it is quite inexpensive currently, so do not waste any time enjoying it again and again as it clearly is one of movies that is not exhausting but quite funny if you're likely to forget some of the injustices which used to vex you.  After all they were really inoffensive, as we almost escaped them unharmed.  I always liked William Friedkin's ""Cruising"" from the making of until the Director's Cut even though I have always questioned the implication that possibly John Forbes, the Al Pacino character, became a killer due to his ""association"" with the gay milieu of the leather scene, with the film and its director ambiguous about that purposely.  But ""Partners"" aspires to way less.  Although it seems more accessible today than when it was realized upon its release, appreciate it as there is still too little of these sensibilities to do that, after all it has been a long time since ""Brokeback Mountain.""  Directed by James Burrows, Veber was executive producer as well.  Georges Delerue's score gives the film a bit of a French film feel.  Triumphantly starring Ryan O'Neal and John Hurt as the partners.
