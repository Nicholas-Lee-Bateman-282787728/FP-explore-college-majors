Since then everyone to whom I have mentioned the movie simply lights up and glows in recollection.  The central actor is a lady chef, fleeing from the horrors of Paris (and presumably La Guillotine), who finds refuge with two unmarried ladies in Jutland. The epicurean attitudes of the French refugee is in stark contrast to the stoic existence of the two employers, most definitely in the area of cuisine.  Still, there is humor in the tiniest details, and it is the details that make the movie brilliant.  The original review follows.===This movie has a great many devoted fans, who view it regularly together in groups.  I'm one of them.  I'm a little behind, actually.The story depicts a pair of puritanical Danish spinsters and a Parisienne master chef, who adopt each other, and their gentle and usually respectful attempts to understand each others' points of view.  The implied criticism of puritanism seems to be the central theme of the story, but I think the movie transcends the limited aims of the original novel.I believe the author of this story is also the author of Out of Africa.  Perhaps it is her sardonic wit that provides the backbone for the humor in the movie, but the movie's genius simply defies analysis.Your mileage will definitely vary, since the movie appeals to the experience of the viewer; those brought up in a strongly religious protestant home will probably appreciate the details a lot more.  But I will take a risk, and recommend it without reservation to everyone.Arch",5,A great movie of our time!,1198713600,"12 27, 2007",2007,1625,"['time', 'first', 'reviewed', 'was', 'not', 'aware', 'cult', 'phenomenon', 'status', 'movie', 'probably', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'then', 'everyone', 'whom', 'have', 'mentioned', 'movie', 'simply', 'up', 'glows', 'recollection', 'central', 'actor', 'lady', 'chef', 'fleeing', 'horrors', 'Paris', 'presumably', 'La', 'Guillotine', 'who', 'refuge', 'two', 'unmarried', 'ladies', 'Jutland', 'epicurean', 'attitudes', 'French', 'refugee', 'stark', 'contrast', 'stoic', 'existence', 'two', 'employers', 'most', 'definitely', 'area', 'cuisine', 'Still', 'humor', 'tiniest', 'details', 'details', 'make', 'movie', 'brilliant', 'original', 'review', 'follows.===This', 'movie', 'great', 'many', 'devoted', 'fans', 'who', 'view', 'regularly', 'together', 'groups', ""'m"", 'one', ""'m"", 'little', 'behind', 'actually.The', 'story', 'pair', 'puritanical', 'Danish', 'spinsters', 'Parisienne', 'master', 'chef', 'who', 'adopt', 'other', 'gentle', 'usually', 'respectful', 'attempts', 'understand', 'others', 'points', 'view', 'implied', 'criticism', 'puritanism', 'be', 'central', 'theme', 'story', 'think', 'movie', 'limited', 'aims', 'original', 'novel.I', 'believe', 'author', 'story', 'also', 'author', 'Out', 'Africa', 'Perhaps', 'sardonic', 'wit', 'backbone', 'humor', 'movie', 'movie', 'genius', 'simply', 'analysis.Your', 'mileage', 'will', 'definitely', 'vary', 'movie', 'appeals', 'experience', 'viewer', 'brought', 'up', 'strongly', 'religious', 'protestant', 'home', 'will', 'probably', 'appreciate', 'details', 'lot', 'more', 'will', 'take', 'risk', 'recommend', 'reservation', 'everyone.Arch']",Babette's Feast VHS

Then I started watching this small gem and discovered a lovely story of two worlds, one French and One Danish. One was a world of older, pious or shall I say devoute' believers. The other world was the one of the young French woman who seeks solice and work, and finds both in this quiet if staid community.  The older people reminded me a great deal of the Shakers and even some Amish and local Quakers I know. Simple living and no showing off types. Then the young woman is surprised to discover that she has won the French lottery and rather than simply keep the money and save or spend it on herself, she sets out to help the others celebrate not only a passage in life, but also the bounty that life offers.And being French she knows that food is a gift that God gives and she wants these souls to experience food that they have never had before. Not the simple food their astere' religion etc teaches, but much more.So she buys the best ingredients and sets about to prepare a feast. And when done and served the elders discover that they indeed have had a gift from God and that food can indeed be a communal experience that is thought provoking as well as healing in many respects.

246841,A1YQJ6JI1RTOFA,6301216156,Blockhed Blockhed,"[2, 2]","Lovely, delightful, charming re-telling of one of Karen Blixen's most characteristic stories. Huston's ""The Dead"" may have preceded and perhaps inspired it, but ""Babette's Feast"" is actually an even better, sweeter, more brilliantly acted, written and directed film. Personally, I lean more to Scandinavia than Ireland. I won't recount the plot, and I still can't understand why reviewers think that repeating the plot is a review: once is enough, please. Please. I can only make a few comments. First of all, the General's name is Lowenhielm, which means Lion Helmet, and he is not Danish in the slightest, even though he has a Danish aunt, but 100% Swedish. Jarl Kulle was one of Sweden's greatest actors. He died in 1997. Throughout the movie he is speaking in Swedish, which Danes can understand and vice versa. Not that it matters, but I would have thought that even an Amazon reviewer, although an American, would try to get things right. Secondly, this is a lovely and wonderful summing-up of life's traumas and vicissitudes.

Huston's ""The Dead"" may have preceded and perhaps inspired it, but ""Babette's Feast"" is actually an even better, sweeter, more brilliantly acted, written and directed film. Personally, I lean more to Scandinavia than Ireland. I won't recount the plot, and I still can't understand why reviewers think that repeating the plot is a review: once is enough, please. Please. I can only make a few comments. First of all, the General's name is Lowenhielm, which means Lion Helmet, and he is not Danish in the slightest, even though he has a Danish aunt, but 100% Swedish. Jarl Kulle was one of Sweden's greatest actors. He died in 1997. Throughout the movie he is speaking in Swedish, which Danes can understand and vice versa. Not that it matters, but I would have thought that even an Amazon reviewer, although an American, would try to get things right. Secondly, this is a lovely and wonderful summing-up of life's traumas and vicissitudes. We have to face the slings and arrows that life hands us, and come out of it with chins up, still able to derive comfort from whatever fate delivers, whether it kills our spouse and child, or whether it suddenly offers us a winning ticket.

246843,A20IIR0422G3A5,6301216156,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[4, 9]","`Babette's Feast', a film in Danish directed by Gabriel Axel and based on a story by Isak Dinesen was an Academy Award winner for best foreign film for its year of release and it is commonly held up as one of the better movies involving food. My recollection of my first viewing of the movie several years ago sustains the sense that this is a superior movie. That sense did not survive my current viewing of the film. Foreign language films, especially Scandinavian films, are typically a lot more subtle than comparable American movies, but this film is simply too low key to merit high praise.The story centers around two sisters living in a small Danish community in Jutland (in modern Denmark), just across the straits from Stockholm, Sweden. I would need to consult my history to be sure of this, but I sense that at the time of this story in the latter half of the 19th century, Denmark was part of Sweden. The defining element in the two sisters' life was their father, who was a local religious leader of some note, powerful enough to hold sway over the lives of the small community even 100 years after his birth and death in late middle age. Before the main action of the movie, the sisters, especially the more attractive one played by Bibi Anderson has semiserious romantic encounters with first a lieutenant in the Swedish army and then a noted French tenor who is vacationing in Jutland for his health.We reach the heart of the matter when a French refugee from the disturbances in Paris in 1871 is sent to live with the two sisters by the French tenor as an escape from political persecution. As the refugee, our Babette of the title, learns how to prepare the `cuisine' of Jutland, based on dried and salted fish, stale bread, and salt pork, we see her managing the sisters' household with greater skill than the sisters themselves. The climax to the story is set up with the coincidental 100th anniversary of the father's birth with Babette's winning 10,000 francs in a French lottery. In gratitude for Babette's being sheltered by the sisters, Babette volunteers to prepare the centenary dinner for the community by preparing a `real French meal'. In spite of the religious austerity of the community, the sisters agree and Babette is off to buy provisions, returning with all sorts of exotic foodstuffs, including a cage full of live grouse and a very large, live sea turtle.The great problem of the story arises when the sisters and their community become apprehensive about the risk to their religiosity that may be posed by a gourmet meal. Hence, they all agree to eat the meal without taking any pleasure in the feast. Their resolve becomes unraveled when the nephew of one of the community members, a general who has seen much of the world, including Paris, is invited to the feast of 12 guests. Oddly, any analogy to the Last Supper is so subtle I'm afraid it escapes me, other than the number of diners.The feast is resolved with all the community members being warmed to appreciate one another, the general revealing that Babette was the greatest woman chef in Paris, and the discovery that Babette spent her entire winnings on buying the means to offer the feast.I have no idea if Dinesen's story makes more of this fable than we see in the movie. I certainly see some missed opportunities in not exploring the legitimacy of austerity versus our best understanding of Protestant doctrine.The one way in which the movie rises above others is in the interest and accuracy in the preparation of the dishes. The script and the camera doesn't `dwell' on the food as you may see in the famous dining scene in `Tom Jones', but it does show enough to appreciate that the culinary consultant to the movie earned his pay in creating interesting and accurate 19th century French dishes.While I sense I may have missed some subtitles in this movie, I'm keen enough to recognize that whatever I did miss would not add a lot to the movie.If you happen to be fond of food movies, this one is very good, but not as good as `Tampopo' or Stanley Tucci's `Big Night'.",4,Very Good Movie which does not wear well.

Babette has nothing to give that they want, and so the relationship grows from this tiny movement of mutual grace.Babette, an acclaimed chef, needs to hide for political reasons. She is introduced to sisters Martine and Filippa by way of a letter from a mutual friend. As they hire her with no promise of payment, Babette offers to cook for the sisters who know nothing of Babette's reputation in the kitchen. More than a ""Stone Soup"" chicanerist, she has the ability to do much with little. Humbly, she lets the sisters teach her to make potato soup. Esculent in every way a potato soup could be, the meal convinces the sisters they have made the right move.Based on a story by Isak Dinesen (author of ""Out of Africa"") found in her collection, ""Anecdotes of Destiny,"" it is not a story about the clich&eacute;d sensual delights of food, as found in lesser films such as ""Chocolat."" It is about the grace of being humble, of serving, and of enjoying both the simple and grand things of God. Whether making potato soup or quail in vol-au-vents, Babette always is thankful and diligent to do her best.When Babette wins the lottery, she decides to make a meal as thanks to the town. She orders delicacies unheard of, and asks the community to help prepare the feast. Skepticism dies down as her neighbors sample morsels, and a new life comes to the village. This is where the comparisons to ""Chocolat"" begin and end, as Babette's only desire is to lift the spirits of the town she has been so much blessed by.The long table of near-gluttonous dining is memorable. It far exceeds any American Thanksgiving dinner cornucopia overflow, yet is as thankful. So much of the movie culminates then, and the movie satisfies the deepest hunger for a tasty conclusion.Finding a layer by which to appreciate ""Babette's Feast"" is just a matter of watching. For Christians, you will find a subtext of understanding simplicity vs displaying gifts from God. For foodies, you will watch a dream meal presented as Julia Child herself never imagined. For cinematography buffs, you will see a French village shot in intimate detail, so as if you could smell the door frame wood after the rain.Attend to your senses and sensibilities and order up a copy of ""Babette's Feast.""",5,"About Grace, Glory and Goodness",1118188800,"06 8, 2005",2005,2530,"['might', 'say', 'Babette', 'Feast', 'symbolically', 'when', 'Babette', 'make', 'meal', 'only', 'princes', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'before.The', 'story', 'subsequent', 'message', 'grace', 'glory', 'truly', 'when', 'Babette', 'received', 'two', 'middle-aged', 'women', 'nothing', 'offer', 'home', 'Babette', 'nothing', 'give', 'want', 'so', 'relationship', 'tiny', 'movement', 'mutual', 'grace.Babette', 'acclaimed', 'chef', 'hide', 'political', 'reasons', 'introduced', 'sisters', 'Martine', 'Filippa', 'way', 'letter', 'mutual', 'friend', 'hire', 'promise', 'payment', 'Babette', 'cook', 'sisters', 'who', 'know', 'nothing', 'Babette', 'reputation', 'kitchen', 'More', 'Stone', 'Soup', 'chicanerist', 'ability', 'do', 'much', 'little', 'Humbly', 'sisters', 'teach', 'make', 'potato', 'soup', 'Esculent', 'way', 'potato', 'soup', 'could', 'be', 'meal', 'sisters', 'have', 'made', 'right', 'move.Based', 'story', 'Isak', 'Dinesen', 'author', 'Out', 'Africa', 'found', 'collection', 'Anecdotes', 'Destiny', 'not', 'story', 'clich', 'eacute', 'sensual', 'delights', 'food', 'found', 'lesser', 'films', 'such', 'Chocolat', 'grace', 'being', 'humble', 'serving', 'enjoying', 'simple', 'grand', 'things', 'God', 'Whether', 'making', 'potato', 'soup', 'quail', 'vol-au-vents', 'Babette', 'always', 'thankful', 'diligent', 'do', 'best.When', 'Babette', 'lottery', 'make', 'meal', 'thanks', 'town', 'orders', 'delicacies', 'unheard', 'community', 'help', 'prepare', 'feast', 'Skepticism', 'down', 'neighbors', 'sample', 'morsels', 'new', 'life', 'village', 'where', 'comparisons', 'Chocolat', 'begin', 'end', 'Babette', 'only', 'desire', 'lift', 'spirits', 'town', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'blessed', 'by.The', 'long', 'table', 'near-gluttonous', 'dining', 'memorable', 'far', 'American', 'Thanksgiving', 'dinner', 'cornucopia', 'overflow', 'yet', 'thankful', 'So', 'much', 'movie', 'then', 'movie', 'deepest', 'hunger', 'tasty', 'conclusion.Finding', 'layer', 'appreciate', 'Babette', 'Feast', 'just', 'matter', 'watching', 'Christians', 'will', 'find', 'subtext', 'understanding', 'simplicity', 'vs', 'displaying', 'gifts', 'God', 'foodies', 'will', 'watch', 'dream', 'meal', 'presented', 'Julia', 'Child', 'never', 'imagined', 'cinematography', 'buffs', 'will', 'see', 'French', 'village', 'shot', 'intimate', 'detail', 'so', 'could', 'smell', 'door', 'frame', 'wood', 'rain.Attend', 'senses', 'sensibilities', 'order', 'up', 'copy', 'Babette', 'Feast']",Babette's Feast VHS

It matters not whether you are liberal or conservative, spiritual or secular: There is nothing not to like about this movie. If you (1) believe that good, well-prepared food can be spiritually-uplifting, and (2) you enjoyed the recent Lasse Halstrom film &quot;Chocolat,&quot; then you should purchase &quot;Babette's Feast&quot; ASAP.Stephane Audran plays Babette Hersant, a refugee from civil war-torn France who finds sanctuary in the home of two elderly sisters living in a small village on the barren Jutland coast in Denmark. The religious community the sisters belong to is one in which denial of Earthly pleasure is key to one's spiritual redemption; yet unbeknownst to them, Babette was a gourmet chef of considerable renown back in France. Later, in gratitude to the villagers for their kindness, Babette offers to prepare them a French gourmet dinner; and although the villagers reluctantly agree to this extravagance, the soon realize that they may be opening themselves up to temptations of an almost diabolical nature. So before dinner is served, they agree amongst themselves to eat the meal without necessarily ENJOYING it. The ensuing scene at the dinner table, in which the guests are so obviously enjoying the meal yet unable to say so, is delightful.I'm especially pleased with this DVD transfer. The last time I saw this film was by way of an old VHS copy, and while the story was imminently enjoyable, the picture was scratchy and washed-out compared this new release; this new transfer is fresh and rich-looking. For people who don't care for subtitles, there is the option of watching this film dubbed in English, but I wouldn't recommend it, because the actress used for Babette's voice speaks in a higher pitch and makes the woman sound like something of a French sex kitten.",5,A singular GEM of a movie.

As the film opens, we are introduced to Martine and Philippa, daughters of a charismatic preacher in a tiny Jutland village. Dedicated to their father's work, they turn down the courtship of a Danish officer and a French musician. Decades later, the musician sends them Babette, a refugee from the destruction of the Paris Commune, in the hope that the sisters can shelter her and employ her as a maid. When she wins an annual lottery, Babette decides to put on a feast for her employers, but no one expects the depths of selflessness she goes to.BABETTE'S FEAST is entertaining enough, and it gives an idea of just how dull and messy life in Jutland was at this time.

If you've seen it, you know it's a classic that is definitely worth owning, to be viewed and enjoyed repeatedly.  If you've never seen Babette's Feast, you owe it to yourself to see it and find out what people mean when they say they experience a film.  Yes, it's that good and that powerful.  And the best part of it all: no guns, no explosions, no sex, no vulgarity.The DVD is, without a doubt, THE format for this movie.  The print has been considerably cleaned up and brightened.  What a difference with my &quot;old&quot; fuzzy VHS copy!  The widescreen format benefits this film tremendously.  The sound is crisp and even, with no sudden drops or surges in volume.  The DVD offers three language tracks: the original Danish/French, English, and Spanish.  I personally recommend that you keep the Danish/French track with English subtitles.  It's the only real way to convey the full meaning and emotions of the story.  Avoid the English track at all costs: it's unbelievably bland and emotionless (thereby removing any and all subtleties and charm from this superb story) and it's muffled.

DeRiemer,"[3, 3]","I don't know whether this film hits my heart the way it does because of the feelings of friendship, love, closeness to others or the warmth of that transformation Babette's cooking creates, but when the feast starts and for the rest of the movie, I choke up often.Yes, this is a feel-good movie, but without a speck of mawkishness or facile sentimentality. Please note that elements of the plot are discussed. Babette's Feast tells its story with restraint and care, and it lets us discover for ourselves the values of grace and love. All we need to know is that Babette Harsant (Stephane Audran) was a French refugee who was given shelter by two aging sisters in a tiny community on the coast of Jutland. The sisters lead what remains of their father's flock. He was a pastor of conviction who taught that salvation comes through self-denial. The sisters made their sacrifices to duty and faith. Those who still remain honor the now long dead pastor's teachings and his spiritual guidance. Still, as they have grown older the tiny community has become querulous and argumentative. The sisters do what they can. For the pastor's 100th birthday, Babette wishes to cook the dinner for the small group the sisters will invite. The sisters reluctantly agree, but when they see the supplies Babette has ordered, they and their guests become uneasy. They are used to the community's usual fare of dried cod, boiled, and a soup made of bread, water and a little ale. Even though Babette over time has made improvements, what they are seeing now seems close to godlessness. At the dinner also will be a visitor, General Lorens Lowenhielm, who years earlier had chosen ambition over his love for one of the sisters.What do we experience? There is the austerity of the aging community's faith and the stone, wind-swept cottages they live in. There is the warmth by candlelight of the sisters' small, crowded dining room. And then there is the transforming power of Babette's artistry as we watch her cook, watch Erik, a young boy helping her, serve and pour, and watch the old parishioners, with the help of fine wine and exquisite cooking, gradually rediscover their community and love and friendship. The General serves as our unexpected guide because he is the only one who knows what extraordinary dishes they are eating. The General tells a story to his uncomprehending dinner companions, a story about a famed woman who was the exemplary chef at the famed Caf&eacute; Anglais in Paris. ""...this woman, this head chef, had the ability to transform a dinner into a kind of love affair...a love affair that made no distinction between bodily appetite and spiritual appetite."" He, too, is being transformed into a man who will accept what he has become and yet will always know the value and the love of what long ago he chose not to accept. An old couple kiss. Two old men remember past friendships. And Babette, who spent all that she had won in a lottery on this dinner, has had an opportunity to be the artist she once was in France, an opportunity she accepted with love and friendship.Babette, now as poor as she was when she arrived penniless years earlier, will continue with the sisters. The general in a carriage with his aunt returns to her estate. And the elderly guests leave the sisters' home to return to their own cottages. They pause and look at the clear night sky and the stars overhead. They spontaneously hold hands in a circle and dance and sing this hymn...""The clock strikes and time goes byEternity is nigh.Let us use this time to tryTo serve the Lord with heart and mind.So that our true home we shall find.So that our true home we shall find.""They smile at each other. All has been reconciled.Babette's Feast is a wonderful movie, full of restrained emotion, unspoken understandings, wisdom...and, of course, a meal that will leave you with a growling stomach as you exit the theater. If you win a lottery so you could afford what Babette created and have her skill and artistry, here's what she served:Potage a la Tortue (a rich turtle soup), served with amontillado sherryBlinis Demidoff au Caviar (small buckwheat pancakes with sour cream and caviar), served with Veuve Clicquot champagneCailles en Sarcophage with Sauce Perigourdine (boned quail stuffed with foie gras and truffle in puff pastry with truffle sauce enriched with Madeira), served with Clos de Vougeot, a fine burgundySaladeCheese and fresh fruitBaba au Rhum with glacee fruit and fresh figsCoffee and a fine

Prior to the meal they were bickering and arguing; after the meal was well in progress they all turned into much sweeter people and left at the end of the meal in much more pleasant moods.

And then there came the baritone from the Paris opera who heard her sister Phillipa's soprano voice at choir and fell immediately and hopeless in love with her, and sought to train her voice and carry her away.  But no, he too could not melt the snows of her near Arctic heart, and so returned to Paris where he played out his (now) empty career.Flash forward to the entrance of Babette, whom the opera singer sends many years later to the sisters to hide from the strife in France.  She will be an angel of gastronomy, household management and common sense who will mend their souls and fill them with joy.This is a tale of unrequited love.  Of love that festers and longs and does not die.  How I adore the love stories where the love is never consummated!  I love the years of yearning, the melancholy realization that it could never work, and yet, and yet...  And then when they are old and past any pretense, how wonderful it is to know that the anticipation, the savoring, the longing, the utter lack of finality, how wonderful THAT was, and how superior to a banal consummation!But then, such is not the usual taste.  Speaking of tastes, this is not a movie to see on an empty stomach.  The climatic feast of turtle soup, quail in pastry, rich sauces, dessert, fromage, fruit, etc., washed down with amontillado, champagne, etc. will whet your appetite.  A little stunning for this modest epicure was the Clos de Vougeot, 1845 that the general so admired.  Can you imagine how beautiful that wine was, and what it would fetch today!This is also a tale of Christian piety, and a joining of the Protestant and the Catholic, of how a Lutheran might learn from a Papist, of how the temperate zone might warm the north.  How food really is a sacrament.Anyway, we know from the moment Babette comes to the austere, but grand old pious ladies to cook for them that she is something special.  When the ladies show her how to precisely prepare the mundane Danish meals of bread soup and soaked, smoked flounder, we know immediately that she is a great cook; after all she is Parisian, and an opera star has signified her as such.  But she modestly says not a word and learns the Danish names and follows faithfully the Danish recipes, as though she were an ingenue.  She works for nothing, having lost her family to the bloodshed in France, and what has she to live for but to do what she has to do and do it right.  And does she ever!Babette's Feast is as heart-warming as a Disney tale would love to be.  It is as uplifting as a stirring Sousa march, and as satisfying as a seven-course meal at the Grand Hotel in Paris, France.  It starts like a novel from the nineteenth century, slow and studied, and before you know it, has captured your fancy.  Director Gabriel Axel unfolds the story with precision and a careful attention to detail, but ultimately with an invisible simplicity and economy.  What he is saying in the end, is what he has the general pronounce after the sensuous meal (which is quite a moral extravagance, perhaps even a sinfulness for the pious flock): ""Righteousness and bliss shall kiss one another.""Someday, one hopes in this world, they shall.",5,"A bittersweet, redemptive northern masterpiece",976060800,"12 6, 2000",2000,4076,"['Take', 'style', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'stir', 'Lutheranism', 'add', 'dash', 'Guy', 'De', 'Maupassant', 'pinch', 'Chekov', 'such', 'severe', 'forbidding', 'brew', 'Mix', 'well', 'grand', 'cuisine', 'nineteenth', 'century', 'France', 'what', 'do', 'have', 'Babette', 'Feast', 'story', 'Isak', 'Dinesen', 'short', 'story', 'two', 'lovely', 'maiden', 'sisters', 'Jutland', 'pious', 'daughters', 'stern', 'dictatorial', 'minister', 'who', 'spurn', 'chance', 'love', 'remained', 'devoted', 'austere', 'Protestant', 'creed', 'puritanical', 'selfish', 'father', 'are', 'subjected', 'bleak', 'harsh', 'winters', 'endless', 'hours', 'knitting', 'long', 'silences', 'sighs', 'sighs', 'Ah', 'Danes', 'Norwegians', 'Swedes', 'how', 'beautifully', 'brood', 'see', 'barren', 'beauty', 'Martina', 'who', 'so', 'enchanted', 'young', 'cavalryman', 'when', 'could', 'not', 'melt', 'cold', 'cold', 'heart', 'instead', 'vowed', 'be', 'success', 'succeeded', 'then', 'came', 'baritone', 'Paris', 'opera', 'who', 'heard', 'sister', 'Phillipa', 'soprano', 'voice', 'choir', 'fell', 'immediately', 'hopeless', 'love', 'sought', 'train', 'voice', 'carry', 'away', 'too', 'could', 'not', 'melt', 'snows', 'near', 'Arctic', 'heart', 'so', 'returned', 'Paris', 'where', 'played', 'out', 'now', 'empty', 'career.Flash', 'forward', 'entrance', 'Babette', 'whom', 'opera', 'singer', 'many', 'years', 'later', 'sisters', 'hide', 'strife', 'France', 'will', 'be', 'angel', 'gastronomy', 'household', 'management', 'common', 'sense', 'who', 'will', 'mend', 'souls', 'fill', 'joy.This', 'tale', 'unrequited', 'love', 'love', 'festers', 'longs', 'not', 'die', 'How', 'adore', 'love', 'stories', 'where', 'love', 'never', 'consummated', 'love', 'years', 'yearning', 'melancholy', 'realization', 'could', 'never', 'work', 'yet', 'yet', 'then', 'when', 'are', 'old', 'past', 'pretense', 'how', 'wonderful', 'know', 'anticipation', 'savoring', 'longing', 'utter', 'lack', 'finality', 'how', 'wonderful', 'was', 'how', 'superior', 'banal', 'consummation', 'then', 'such', 'not', 'usual', 'taste', 'Speaking', 'tastes', 'not', 'movie', 'see', 'empty', 'stomach', 'climatic', 'feast', 'turtle', 'soup', 'quail', 'pastry', 'rich', 'sauces', 'dessert', 'fromage', 'fruit', 'etc.', 'washed', 'down', 'amontillado', 'champagne', 'etc', 'will', 'whet', 'appetite', 'little', 'stunning', 'modest', 'epicure', 'was', 'Clos', 'de', 'Vougeot', '1845', 'general', 'so', 'admired', 'Can', 'imagine', 'how', 'beautiful', 'wine', 'was', 'what', 'would', 'fetch', 'today', 'also', 'tale', 'Christian', 'piety', 'joining', 'Protestant', 'Catholic', 'how', 'Lutheran', 'might', 'learn', 'Papist', 'how', 'temperate', 'zone', 'might', 'warm', 'north', 'How', 'food', 'really', 'sacrament.Anyway', 'know', 'moment', 'Babette', 'austere', 'grand', 'old', 'pious', 'ladies', 'cook', 'something', 'special', 'When', 'ladies', 'show', 'how', 'precisely', 'prepare', 'mundane', 'Danish', 'meals', 'bread', 'soup', 'soaked', 'smoked', 'flounder', 'know', 'immediately', 'great', 'cook', 'Parisian', 'opera', 'star', 'signified', 'such', 'modestly', 'not', 'word', 'Danish', 'names', 'faithfully', 'Danish', 'recipes', 'were', 'ingenue', 'nothing', 'having', 'lost', 'family', 'bloodshed', 'France', 'live', 'do', 'what', 'do', 'do', 'right', 'ever', 'Babette', 'Feast', 'as', 'heart-warming', 'Disney', 'tale', 'would', 'love', 'be', 'as', 'uplifting', 'stirring', 'Sousa', 'march', 'as', 'satisfying', 'seven-course', 'meal', 'Grand', 'Hotel', 'Paris', 'France', 'novel', 'nineteenth', 'century', 'slow', 'studied', 'know', 'captured', 'fancy', 'Director', 'Gabriel', 'Axel', 'story', 'precision', 'careful', 'attention', 'detail', 'ultimately', 'invisible', 'simplicity', 'economy', 'What', 'saying', 'end', 'what', 'general', 'pronounce', 'sensuous', 'meal', 'quite', 'moral', 'extravagance', 'perhaps', 'even', 'sinfulness', 'pious', 'flock', 'Righteousness', 'bliss', 'shall', 'kiss', 'one', 'Someday', 'one', 'world', 'shall']",Babette's Feast VHS

Her background is a secret and no one enquires, or even appears the wonder about her until she serves the sisters and their little band of brethren a feast, then it becomes apparent to us that she is none other than the famous Parisiene chef who designed meals of breath taking creativity during the reign of Napoleon 111. The brethren are so frightened of the gift she gives them that they determine not to taste or comment on the meal but Babette's art works a magic of its own and the gift she gives these dour people is more than food.

The most well-known sequence of the film is Babette's dinner preparations - her deft and loving handling of luscious gourmet fare.  But this movie is also filled with amusing contrasts and the difficult choices certain characters must make between offering their incomparable talents to the world or laying them to rest in their quiet village.  What makes these choices even more heart-rending is the quiet resignation and dignity of each of the characters.We are introduced to the spartan lives of a small religious circle led by a stern but gentle minister.  His two attractive young daughters are quietly devoted to him and are each tested by temptations of the world beyond the village.  In one instance, the musically-gifted daughter is discovered by a famous musician and given voice lessons in which even her scales are angelically sung.  She sings the &quot;temptation scene&quot; from Mozart's Don Giovanni (La ci darem la mano) with her worldly music teacher - it was cleverly done and quite lovely.The years pass, and by request of the musician, the elderly sisters take in a mysterious Parisian refugee, Babette, who has a knack for making even ale-bread palatable.  The most remarkable segment of the film follows Babette's first and only request to prepare an anniversary dinner in memory of the deceased minister. Thanks to the invitation of an important last minute guest, her artistic &quot;signature&quot; is recognized and truly appreciated.  Amidst the ordinary, pious religious members, this guest savors with surprise the delectable dishes (turtle soup, blini Demidoff with caviar, quail with truffle) and finest wines (Veuve Cliquot, Amontillado, Clos Vougeot!) offered to him in a little white-washed village cottage.

246872,A2SRZQU1SZG4RR,6301216156,"Erika Borsos ""pepper flower""","[4, 4]","This is an elegant film which tells a story filled with symbolism and meaning. The cinematography is outstanding. It is a highly focused story where dialogue is minimal but used to maximum effect. It is about committment, family loyalty, devotion to religion, love, charity, and worldly temptations. The film is based on a short book by Isak Dinesen titled ""Anecdotes of Destiny"". Most interesting is how much of the story and filming occurs within the small village in Denmark. Also, much of the story occurs when the main characters are elderly ...It is great story of faith and giving.Taking place in the 19th century, Martina and Phillipa are the beautiful daughters of a Lutheran pastor in a fishing village in northern Denmark. Their father started a religious sect which is very austere and pious. It emphasizes the ""world to come"" and preaches controlling the passions and appetites of this world. The two lovely daughters never attend balls or parties so the young men who wish to make their acquaintance must attend her father's church to eye the two beauties and speak to them. Two young men in particular fall in love with these ladies but it is not within their destinies to fulfull their desires. Officer Lorens Lowenhielm enters the scene when he is sent back by the Army to live in the palace with his wealthy Aunt for a time. He falls in love with Martina when he first sees her while riding on the hillside of the village when she is drawing water from the well. She chooses to live with her father rather than marry this handsome officer. Phillipa's soprano voice is heard by a French visitor to the village, Achilles Papin who performs opera on the stage in Paris. He approachers her father to offer Phillipa private voice lessons. Achilles Papin is convinced Phillipa will ""wow"" the Parisians where she would become a diva ... Phillipa also declines to pursue this worldy temptation and remains living in the village with her father instead.As the years pass, the beauty of the two sisters fades but never disappears. They perform works of charity for the poor, carrying on the devoted life to which they became accustomed after their father died. There remains a small flock of true believers who meet on Sundays to worship and recall the teachings of this pious man of the cloth. The two sisters receive a letter from Achilles Papin from Paris, asking the sisters to receive Babette into their home. She is a French lady who survived the French Revolution but lost all her family and possesions. She becomes their maid and servant ... making herself indespensible to their lives. The two sisters are able to carry out more of their charitable works and notice Babette has a way of helping them increase their income and livlihood as well.Good fortune shines on Babette, after many years of servitude, she won the French lottery, a princely sum of 10,000 francs. On the 100th birthday of their father, Babette offers to cook a dinner for the sisters and the congregation. Despite some misgivings, the sisters agree. Everyone who attends promises not to show any pleasure in what they eat but to act ""just as if we never had a sense of taste"" for to enjoy would surely be viewed as a sin. They determine not to mention anything about the food when partaking of it.It is a sensuous delight to watch Babette prepare the various courses ... The camera does a superb job of capturing the parishioner's faces who do their damndest to look sullen and neutral while eating this gourmet feast. There is a special dinner guest from the past ... It so happens he did *not* promise to deny his pleasure in dining on this feast. It is highly amusing to watch the guests respond with remarks about the weather as this special guest describes each succulent and delectable dish. His  expressions of appreciation for each French delicacy is priceless. He especially appreciates the superb Spanish wine and champagne, which it is noted none of the parishioners refuse.

Taylor ""GFT""","[24, 25]","Flawlessly directed, written, performed, and filmed, this quiet and unpretentious Danish film is an example of cinema at its best, and if a person exists who can watch BABETTE'S FEAST without being touched at a very fundamental level, they are a person I do not care to know.The story is quite simple. In the 1800s, two elderly maiden ladies (Birgitte Federspiel and Bodil Kjer) reside in remote Jutland, where they have sacrificed their lives, romantic possibilities, and personal happiness in order to continue their long-dead father's religious ministry to the small flock he served. One of the women's youthful admirers sends to them a Frenchwoman, Babette (St&eacute;phane Audran), whose husband and son have been killed in France and who has fled her homeland lest she meet the same fate. Although they do not really require her services, the sisters engage her as maid and cook--and as the years pass her cleverness and tireless efforts on their behalf enables the aging congregation to remain together and the sisters to live in more comfort than they had imagined; indeed, the entire village admires and depends upon her. One day, however, Babette receives a letter: she has won a lottery and is now, by village standards, a wealthy woman. Knowing that her new wealth will mean her return to France, the sisters grant her wish that she be allowed to prepare a truly French meal for them and the members of their tiny congregation.The meal and the evening it is served is indeed a night to remember--but not for reasons that might be expected, for Babette's feast proves to be food for both body and soul, and is ultimately her gift of love to the women who took her in and the villagers who have been so kind to her. The film is extraordinary in every way, meticulous in detail yet not overpowering in its presentation of them. As the film progresses, we come to love the characters in both their simple devotion to God and their all-too-human frailties, and the scenes in which Babette prepares her feast and in which the meal is consumed are powerful, beautiful, and incredibly memorable. There have been several films that have used food as a metaphor for love, including WATER FOR CHOCOLATE and CHOCOLATE, but none approach the simple artistry and beauty of BABETTE'S FEAST, which reminds us of all the good things about humanity and which proves food for both body and soul.

246876,A3EFCK0HZQPNQI,6301216156,Geoff Puterbaugh,"[0, 0]","I apologize for stealing my review title from another reviewer.  But that reviewer really put it well: how could a movie about a MEAL be interesting, in any way, shape, or form? More than that: how could it be a masterpiece?I can only offer my own insight that masterpieces are almost always complete surprises.  A good example is ""The Little Prince,"" which is ""only"" a silly short book about some imaginary prince-boy living way off in outer space, with clumsy illustrations by the author to boot.  But it's a masterpiece: it has been translated into umpteen languages, and has sold more millions of copies than I would ever be able to count.Why?  I would guess it's because the characters, through the magic of fiction, reach out and grab you and make you care about them.""Strangely enough,"" the same is true of ""Babette's Feast.""  It takes place in a tiny fishing community, and has what must be the most vivid characters I have seen in years.  No, not Fellini's gross exaggerations: we are looking at Real People here, and the values which shape their actions and their lives.  There are important themes in the movie, very important ones: is being ""morally good"" enough to guarantee happiness?  Or is there a role for simple pleasure in the grand scheme of things?  The film does not really answer these questions, but it does ask them, and it suggests that a radical religious Puritanism, which turns all pleasure aside at the door, may not be the complete definition of the good life.  (In this context, you might to look at Henry James's movel, ""The Europeans.""  Did Isak Dineson read that novel, I wonder?)The movie is, on one level, a comic delight --- a wonderful light comedy.  But it probes some of the deepest questions we ever have to ask ourselves.  We may all admit that a life spent giddily pursuing pleasure is bound to be superficial, but is there really any point to denying ourselves the pleasures that life offers?A world-famous writer used to fry (!) Oscar Mayer bologna, and eat it with Campbell's soup.

This movie is on my top ten favorite movies.I was surprised when I first purchased the video that the story was by the great Isak Dinsen who wrote Out of Africa.  I won't elaborate on the other reviewers who succinctly posted their thoughts, but I agree with most of them that this is one of the most beautiful movies ever made.From the first moments of the film where we are introduced to the sisters and their minister father who live in a desolate town on the coast of Denmark and then to the ""feast"" itself, I was totally entranced.  The scenery was bleak but beautiful, as was the total dedication of this family to the people in this small community.The part of Babette was played by the glorious French actress Stephane Audran.  You may have seen in her in many French movies, one in particular, Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie, and as the mistress of Lawrence Olivier in Bridehead Revisited.  Could anyone be so wonderfully French!  And so beautiful!The scenes in the small kitchen where Babette cooks her ""feast"" are undeniably the highlight of the film. I felt like I was there in the kitchen with them with the scents and the heat from the oven. The poor turtle (did they really cook it?), the squabs, the delicious wines.

246886,A2TT4AA3QO0DPY,6301216156,Jay Young,"[4, 4]","""Babette's Feast"" is definitely one of the best movies I have seen. It combines excellent characterization, cerebral dialogue, and beautiful cinematography to create a masterpiece. All of the subplots come together at the end for a satisfying conclusion.The movie opens with a voice-over narrator telling about Martina and Phillipa (named after Martin Luther and Philip Melancthon), the daughters of a deceased Protestant minister. They live in a small community on the Danish coast of Jutland in the 1830s. The late minister founded a sect of his own, and his daughters continue his work after he has been deceased. The remaining followers meet in the sisters' home, singing hymns and discussing scripture. The sisters' French servant, Babette, makes an appearance, and the narrator promises to tell how they got a French servant.At this point, the story goes back in time, to where the minister is still alive and the sisters are young. We see the minister and his congregation meeting in a classic church and singing hymns that most American protestants could probably sing along to (if they weren't in Danish), and get a taste of Danish pietist culture. In the meantime, the sisters, being so attractive, attract various suitors. Their father turns them away, however, saying that his daughters is all he has. Soon, an officer of the Danish army, Lorens Lowenhaim, arrives in the village as punishment for dishonorable conduct. Lowenhaim is struck by Martina's beauty, and through the influence of his pious aunt, is able to get inside the minister's house. At that point, however, the officer realizes that he cannot stay there and marry Martina; life is too harsh and simple for one thing, and he wants to move up in his career. For another, he knows, even without Martina saying anything, that she would never leave the town. So Lowenhaim marries a lady of Queen Sophia's court, wooing her with piety, which was popular at the time.Shortly thereafter, the French opera singer Achille Papin arrives from Paris, seeking some relaxation. He goes into the church and Philippa's singing impresses him greatly. He has dreams of her coming back to Paris and becoming an opera star. Papin asks for the minister's permission to give his daughter voice lessons, and even though he's a ""papist,"" the minister agrees. Philippa picks up very quickly and displays remarkable talent. Unfortunately, when Papin falls in love with her and tells her that she will make a great opera star, she relays to her father that she wants to stop the lessons, and the minister gives a letter to the opera singer to that effect. Broken-hearted, Papin returns to Paris on a boat.Many years later, a young woman arrives on the sisters' doorstep during a storm. She carries a letter from Papin, urging them to take in the woman, Babette, as she is a refugee from the civil strife involving the 1871 Paris Commune. They agree to do so, and Babette becomes their servant (though unpaid). Babette's only connection to Paris is a lottery ticket which a friend renews for her every year. After working at the sisters' house for 14 years, Babette finally wins the lottery, and it appears that she will go back to Paris.Meanwhile, Martina and Philippa are preparing a celebration of the deceased minister's 100th birthday. The congregation has grown quarrelsome, with constant mutual recriminations, and the hymns no longer bring the joy and unity they once did. They can only hope that celebrating the minister's birthday will bring unity to the group again. To their surprise, Babette wants to prepare a French dinner for the celebration, and they reluctantly agree. Martina and Philippa get even more apprehensive when they see all the ingredients that have arrived by overseas shipment, such as quails, turtles, and fine wine; they fear that they have invited witchcraft into their home, and the sisters and congregation agree not to discuss the food and drink during the meal. Another guest that shows up is the now-General Lowenhaim, Martina's old would-be suitor, and his aunt.The feast is the most sumptuous that can be imagined. It includes real turtle soup, Blini Demidoff au Caviar (buckwheat cake with caviar), and Caille en Sarcophage- Quail in Puff Pastry Shell with Foie Gras and Truffle Sauce. Lowenhaim is the only one who comments on the food and wine. He relates that the feast reminds him of one that he had in Paris at a place called Cafe Anglais. The chef there, a woman, supposedly could turn a feast into a love affair, and blend bodily and spiritual appetites. The rest stubbornly maintain their vows not to talk about the feast. Despite their intransigence toward the food, the people in the congregation become more amiable to each other, and the peace and unity that the sisters tried to achieve has come back. The general at that point makes a speech, which is the highpoint of the movie. He talks about mercy, and about how in the end, everyone gets back what they rejected. When he leaves, he tells Martina that he will be with her every night in spirit. As for Babette, she does not go back to Paris after all, as she has spent all of her 10,000 francs on the feast. It turns out that she was the chef at Cafe Anglais, and is not worried about having no more money, because ""no artist is poor.""It's wonderful how everything comes together in the end. The minister, Lowenhaim, Papin, the sisters,the congregation, and of course Babette have all contributed to what happens in the end. One comforting message of ""Babette's Feast"" is that earthly enjoyments can be a foretaste of the divine. Martina and Philippa had practiced a religion of denial, and were used to modest suppers of bread and baked cod, which is why they suspected witchcraft when they saw all the ingredients for Babette's feast. In the end, however, the feast becomes the means that the community is reconciled- it's a source of grace. I highly recommend this movie.",5,No Artist is Poor,1199923200,"01 10, 2008",2008,5933,"['Babette', 'Feast', 'definitely', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'excellent', 'characterization',

Some people can't keep up with the slow start to the story, but when telling a good story it's not always necessary to jump right to the exciting part.  You draw it out.  Like cooking, storytelling is a craft that's quickly losing it's place in public eye.  Both have been replaced by getting spoon-fed homogenous crap from a can.At the end of the movie, when the sisters realize that Babette had given all of her money to prepare the meal, I identified with her, I felt a solidarity with her.  She did it to feel like a human being again.  There's such love.  I only hope that someday I might perform like that.  I've always looked at cooking as performance-art.  My older sister is a singer, and I have a love for music, but my medium has always been in food, in feeding people and making it special.  When I prepare meals for my family and friends, or as of late the students at school, I can sometimes hear an orchestra tuning up in my head.  A feeling of ""yes, now, begin"".  I got a sense of that from the movie, too.  The spiritual experience of getting ready to prepare a wonderful meal, the care and patience that it takes.I especially liked that the carriage-driver got to take part in the feast, too :-)  In my current place in life as a lowly kitchen-rat, I appreciate that everyone gets fed.There is unexpected comedy throughout the movie as well, that often goes overlooked.

This classic film, which was based on a short story written by Isak Dinesen/Karen Blixen will always remain indelibly memorable.  I've seen the movie several times, and each time I come away with a deeper philosophical appreciation for the absolute beauty and poignancy of the storyline.  Indeed, BABETTE'S FEAST is actually a repertoire of sorts; offering a powerful message about charity and selflessness, duty and honor, pride and humility, regret and sorrow, faith and forgiveness, and love  and redemption.Two humble spinster sisters who live in a small coastal town in Denmark take in a woman who flees France to escape peril during the French Revolution. The sisters, Martina and Philippa were beautiful young women in their youth, and each gave up the chance for love from suitors - one a young cavalry officer, and one a famous French singer - and chose to remain loyal to their father.  They lived the remainder of their lives in quiet surrender, servitude and sacrifice to carry on the deeply religious teachings of their deceased father who was considered the leader of their devout small religious sect.  However, many decades later when Babette becomes part of the sisters household, subtle changes take place, which causes ambivalent feelings for Martina and Philippa.Sixteen years past quickly, when Babette wins a lottery and asks the sisters if she can prepare a genuine French meal for the 100th anniversary celebration dinner honoring the birth of their late father.  After giving their permission, Martina and Philippa are perplexed by Babette's extravagance and the items she has shipped from France to use in preparation for the meal.  Now horrified, the sisters become haunted by fears that decadence will descend upon them and their small religious sect.  Yet, they can not go back on their promise to allow Babette to prepare this important meal.  All the followers of the sister's religious sect are invited, and all have feelings of deep apprehension.The evening finally arrives, and the small sect join hands in prayer and vow that they will resist whatever beguiling temptations might seduce them to sin.  The announcement for dinner is called.  But instead of fear, as the meal is served the mood is soon changed to that of suspended awe.  Indeed, the grand 'feast' that Babette prepares, becomes both a startling revelation and a powerful redemption for all who attend ... including the high ranking officer who was once the suitor of Martina.I disagree with those who categorize this movie as a Christian message.  Rather, it's a story with a philosophical message that examines timeless issues about man's search for meaning, purpose, and ... salvation.If you've not done so already, I recommend that you include BABETTE'S FEAST in your DVD collection.Maizie Lucille JamesJuly 12, 2010",5,A Classic Foreign Film by Isak Dinesen/Karen Blixen,1278892800,"07 12, 2010",2010,2902,"['saw', 'BABETTE', 'FEAST', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'foreign', 'film', 'festival', 'Washington', 'DC', 'classic', 'film', 'was', 'based', 'short', 'story', 'written', 'Isak', 'Dinesen/Karen', 'Blixen', 'will', 'always', 'remain', 'indelibly', 'memorable', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'several', 'times', 'time', 'come', 'away', 'deeper', 'philosophical', 'appreciation', 'absolute', 'beauty', 'poignancy', 'storyline', 'Indeed', 'BABETTE', 'FEAST', 'actually', 'repertoire', 'sorts', 'offering', 'powerful', 'message', 'charity', 'selflessness', 'duty', 'honor', 'pride', 'humility', 'regret', 'sorrow', 'faith', 'forgiveness', 'love', 'redemption.Two', 'humble', 'spinster', 'sisters', 'who', 'live', 'small', 'coastal', 'town', 'Denmark', 'take', 'woman', 'who', 'France', 'escape', 'peril', 'French', 'Revolution', 'sisters', 'Martina', 'Philippa', 'were', 'beautiful', 'young', 'women', 'youth', 'gave', 'up', 'chance', 'love', 'suitors', 'one', 'young', 'cavalry', 'officer', 'one', 'famous', 'French', 'singer', 'chose', 'remain', 'loyal', 'father', 'lived', 'remainder', 'lives', 'quiet', 'surrender', 'servitude', 'sacrifice', 'carry', 'deeply', 'religious', 'teachings', 'deceased', 'father', 'who', 'was', 'considered', 'leader', 'devout', 'small', 'religious', 'sect', 'However', 'many', 'decades', 'later', 'when', 'Babette', 'part', 'sisters', 'household', 'subtle', 'changes', 'take', 'place', 'ambivalent', 'feelings', 'Martina', 'Philippa.Sixteen', 'years', 'past', 'quickly', 'when', 'Babette', 'lottery', 'sisters', 'can', 'prepare', 'genuine', 'French', 'meal', '100th', 'anniversary', 'celebration', 'dinner', 'honoring', 'birth', 'late', 'father', 'giving', 'permission', 'Martina', 'Philippa', 'are', 'perplexed', 'Babette', 'extravagance', 'items', 'shipped', 'France', 'use', 'preparation', 'meal', 'Now', 'horrified', 'sisters', 'become', 'haunted', 'fears', 'decadence', 'will', 'descend', 'small', 'religious', 'sect', 'can', 'not', 'go', 'back', 'promise', 'allow', 'Babette', 'prepare', 'important', 'meal', 'followers', 'sister', 'religious', 'sect', 'are', 'invited', 'have', 'feelings', 'deep', 'apprehension.The', 'evening', 'finally', 'small', 'sect', 'join', 'hands', 'prayer', 'vow', 'will', 'resist', 'beguiling', 'temptations', 'might', 'seduce', 'sin', 'announcement', 'dinner', 'called', 'instead', 'fear', 'meal', 'served', 'mood', 'soon', 'changed', 'suspended', 'awe', 'Indeed', 'grand', ""'feast"", 'Babette', 'prepares', 'startling', 'revelation', 'powerful', 'redemption', 'who', 'attend', 'including', 'high', 'ranking', 'officer', 'who', 'was', 'once', 'suitor', 'Martina.I', 'disagree', 'who', 'categorize', 'movie', 'Christian', 'message', 'Rather', 'story', 'philosophical', 'message', 'timeless', 'issues', 'man', 'search', 'meaning', 'purpose', 'salvation.If', ""'ve"", 'not', 'done', 'so', 'already', 'recommend', 'include', 'BABETTE', 'FEAST', 'DVD', 'collection.Maizie', 'Lucille', 'JamesJuly', '12', '2010']",Babette's Feast VHS
246907,A129YBX5BVNW2,6301216156,"Mark Barry ""Mark Barry""","[1, 1]","It&#8217;s September 1871 in a remote part of Jutland in Denmark &#8211; and on a rain-sodden night - a young French woman dressed in hooded garb knocks on the door of elderly sisters Martine and Filippa. The serenely beautiful ladies live frugally and quietly in tiny houses high above the cliffs in a deeply Christian Community &#8211; generously feeding the elderly of the flock every single day with hot food culled from their basic cooking skills.The woman is Babette Hersant &#8211; once a worshipped culinary chef in Caf&eacute; Anglais in Paris - and she bears a letter from an elderly French Opera Singer called Achille Papin. He has sent Babette to Denmark by boat to escape political rioting in the capitol city that has robbed her of everything including a husband. Papin visited the sisters when they were youthful beauties many decades back &#8211; and lost his heart to Filippa&#8217;s angelic voice (words from a duet they sing in a clinch together titles this review). But because of fear and entrenched Christian beliefs &#8211; Filippa could not bear what their burgeoning love was doing to her soul &#8211; so she had her Pastor father send him away (and silence his singing). But Papin remembered her kindness too &#8211; so he has sent the broken Babette into their care.14 years pass and Babette has now worked her way into the hearts of the kindly sisters, the local grocer and even the fishermen who can&#8217;t pass off rancid meat or old fish on the food-knowledgeable Babette.  She even knows where the herbs are on the wild grass stretches that overlook the Sea.Babette&#8217;s only link with France is a lottery ticket a kind relative keeps renewing for her year after year. And one day she gets a letter &#8211; she&#8217;s won 10,000 Francs. To their astonishment Babette doesn&#8217;t want to squander the money on clothes or fine things &#8211; but instead payback their kindness by cooking the austere community a proper French Dinner in honour of their Pastor Father whose anniversary is approaching. And Babette wants to do it her way. The sisters agree but have no idea of the opulence that is going to invade their linen-covered table and remain tearfully terrified of its corruptive nature. But great wine, champagne, real turtle soup, sumptuous cooking and divine food mellow the bickering and tetchy elderly community and bring about a deep healing &#8211; even a spiritual renaissance of sorts&#8230;Released in the summer of 1987 and directed by Gabriel Axel (a Danish language movie with English subtitles) &#8211; the film is based on a story by Karen Blixen (aka Isak Dinesen) and its full title is &#34;Karen Blixen's Babette's Gaestebud&#34;. It was Denmark&#8217;s first Oscar Win for a foreign language film (also took the BAFTA).Special mention should be made of the 'young' sisters whose back-story of 'lost love' gives the film its beating heart. A dashing Hussar called Lorens Lowenhielm is stationed in a Garrison Town living a life of tedium and gambling. His father feels he needs to be 'sent away' &#8211; so ships the blue-uniformed young man off to his aunt in Norre Vosburg in Jutland. One afternoon out of horseback he sees his redemption from creditor notes and parental lectures &#8211; the beautiful young Martine. He immediately tries to woe both her and the pious community who surrender her at every moment &#8211; but soon becomes painfully aware that his needs for luxury and easy living far outweigh his needs for Martine. So Lorens leaves and marries a countess with wealth and position. But he has of course made the mistake of a lifetime.Now an old man but still a dashing officer &#8211; he is invited to the feast &#8211; and recognizes the extraordinary cooking skills from a past encounter in Paris (like a warm glow from the past). But more than that &#8211; he fills old Martine&#8217;s heart with joy by telling her that he has always loved her &#8211; and not even the physicality of years or body will keep them apart spiritually (his declaration of love to her at the end is one of the loveliest pieces of dialogue in cinema).I wish I could say the Artificial Eye BLU RAY is a triumph &#8211; far from it. Despite its BFI logo &#8211; the print has specs of dirt on it, lines showing on occasion and a fair amount of natural fuzzy grain. It does look cleaned up in some places &#8211; beautiful even &#8211; but the BLU RAY improvement is slight. It&#8217;s defaulted to 1.85:1 so fills the entire screen but there&#8217;s no getting away from the fact that its good rather than great &#8211; which given the sumptuous nature of the feast &#8211; is so disappointing (docked a star for that).  As I say &#8211; it does look shockingly clean in places &#8211; but anyone expecting frame-by-frame clean up can look elsewhere.There is a short interview in French with Stephane Audran who is intensely proud of the &#8216;masterpiece&#8217; and Subtitles are Danish, Swedish, French and English.&#34;Babette's Feast&#34; is a gentle film &#8211; slow and even pious to a point of being farcical. But the good-humour and warmth will etch its way into your heart &#8211; and after you witness the feast &#8211; be prepared to raid the cookie jars in your kitchen with a passion.As young Papin's heart soars and he tells young Filippa she has 'the voice of joy' &#8211; there are moments in &#34;Babette's Feast&#34; when you are in complete lip-smacking agreement with the rotund Frenchman.

246908,AHUT55E980RDR,6301216156,Neal C. Reynolds,"[10, 11]","This is truly a spiritually uplifting film.  The woman, Babette, becomes maid and cook for two older women in a Danish village.  By the time she comes into the tale, you know the story of the two women.  She becomes one of the family, and then a miracle happens and she wins the lottery.  Her thought then is to cook a feast in honor of their deceased minister father, a feast which these people have never dreamed of, something completely different from the plain simple cooking they're used to.There is much more than that in the film.  The two women are such that it seems sinful to have a lavish gourmet dinner.  The feast sequence is a long, lovingly developed treat for the eyes.  And of course, we realize that Babette is up to a bit more than just providing a sumptious feast.Underneath, the film is telling of a joyous spirit who responds to good fortune by using it to show her love, to do something that will actually endure long after the food is gone.Much has been said by others about this film, so I content myself with pointing out the deep spiritual feel here, the contrast of the love that Babette shows with the piety of the village, and the example she is of the love for others and for life.This is a film not just to see, but to experience.

Babette's feast is not some &quot;movie with a message&quot; otherwise it wouldn't be any good. But it's so real and poignant that much truth can be seen in it, spiritual truth and insights which shed light onto human nature. The relationships are very natural and believable, but the style of narration keeps the story from any kind of overly-subjective viewpoint which infects many movies which delve into human relationships. The actions and conversations arise very naturally and advance the plot superbly.Another thing which I love about the movie is that it reveals something about the nature of good, evil, grace and redemption. None of the acting characters in the movie are ""evil""; however many are infected with smaller sins of pettiness, lack of generosity, glorying in the defeat of others, scrupulosity, jealousy, etc. This movie shows how these defects - small but many - have taken all the joy and pleasure out of life for those suffering under them and that to forgive and be forgiven is necessary to restore the joy of life.

Now only is it preached, they truly practice it, (to the best of their ability).  They obey both their father on earth and their Father in heaven.Babette is inspiring as one who seeks refuge with the two sisters who provide a place for her to live in their small village in Denmark.  She is an immigrant fleeing the horrors of war-torn France. She works hard, is humble, shows consideration for others by paying due respect to her new people, and demonstrates her regard of her new land by observing the rules of the village and of the State.  She gracefully and dutifully accepts her role as cook and servant for the sisters.  She stays single, with neither husband nor child nor family.  She actually gives up her life to care for the two sisters and the villagers.  Her speech is tempered, considerate, modest, accepting, and quiet.  She actually cares about her new Danish neighbors and folk.  So when she wins the lottery, she doesn't spend the money on herself or return to France, she uses the money for a more altruistic purpose.By quietly exploring the modest lives of these villagers and their ""new"" guest, ""Babette's Feast"" has a loud and strong religious message for us to hear, see, and understand.  It is like a pithy rule or commandment that has been fleshed out by the actors into a most remarkable film.I mark this film as the one milestone to judge all other Danish films.

It seems an odd genre; food films.  However, I've discovered that they have a unique effect on me.  While following an interesting story, I become engrossed in the variety of entres and appetizers resulting in a multi-dimensional experience.  I've found it best not to watch such movies on an empty stomach.""Babette's Feast"" tells the story of a couple of exceptional spinster sisters and their fulfilling lives of service to others.  We get to know their father; a forceful preacher who believes that the road to salvation lies in self-denial.  We see the sisters both having romantic opportunities in their younger days and we're never quite certain if they harbor regrets in their later years.  In the midst of their structured lives comes a French woman in need of a sort of mental asylum.  She becomes their servant with her pay rendered in the form of room and board.  She is instructed in the preparation of the local dishes which seem to be just the opposite of her culinary abilities.  Eventually, she comes into money (there is an obvious clue to the source that we just end up waiting to happen).  Her wish is to be able to prepare a 5 star French meal.  The humor in this is that it is for the sister's fellow worshippers; those who deny themselves the luxuries of the material world.All this may not seem like such a great plot but it is the character development that reaches out and involves us intimately in the movie.  We are left with the observation that an artist is always in search of perfection.  The duality of how perfection is perceived ends up being both exclusive and inclusive.  Well, you had to be there.

In this movie, the members of a church, seem to have chosen a very simple existence. Bread and Ale are common fare and a real French dinner seems sinful to them.There are many scenes of singing hymns and living a simple life. The main story revolves around two women who instead of finding love and a life of their own, choose to stay with their father and help him in his ministry. Even after their father has moved on to eternity, they are consumed with charitable work and never start their own families.One year, a lady from France is sent to find them to seek refuge from certain death in Paris. Babette suppresses her own desires and cooks what the two women want until one day she wins the lottery and asks them if she can cook dinner for what would have been their father's 100th birthday. They grant her this wish and then soon feel regret and even fear that they will be punished for experiencing such pleasure.What happens next surprises us all. I don't want to spoil a single minute, but thereare some really funny lines near the end.

While the movie does get quite good after that, I have to wonder whether the Academy simply fast-forwarded through the first half-hour of their screeners when deciding to give the award to this rather than, say, Au Revoir les Enfants. (But then, it was the eighties, when the Academy were collectively demented; anything was possible. I mean, come on, Reds won Best Pitcure.) I suggest you do the same, and stop when you finally meet Babette (Stephane Audran). Everything before that is setup, and it's not especially well-handled setup. In fact, it's not really handled at all. But then expatriate Babette wins the French lottery, and everything starts getting fun.From there, the movie is a foodie's dream. It's like an episode of Iron Chef where there's only one competitor, a blaze of buying, cooking, serving, eating, all of which takes subtle digs at the conventions of the time (which are obvious during the scenes; you don't need the setup for anything other than knowing who's at the table). Wonderful. In other words, watch the last hour of the film and be entertained. The first half-hour, though, feels more like dragging yourself naked along a glacier. ** ",3,"Gets better, but what an awful, awful beginning.",1212105600,"05 30, 2008",2008,1292,"['Babette', 'Feast', 'Gabriel', 'Axel', '1987', 'Babette', 'Feast', '1987', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Film', 'painfully', 'slowly', 'movie', 'get', 'quite', 'good', 'have', 'wonder', 'Academy', 'simply', 'fast-forwarded', 'first', 'half-hour', 'screeners', 'when', 'deciding', 'give', 'award', 'rather', 'say', 'Au', 'Revoir', 'Enfants', 'then', 'was', 'eighties', 'when', 'Academy', 'were', 'collectively', 'demented', 'anything', 'was', 'possible', 'mean', 'come', 'Reds', 'won', 'Best', 'Pitcure', 'suggest', 'do', 'same', 'stop', 'when', 'finally', 'meet', 'Babette', 'Stephane', 'Audran', 'Everything', 'setup', 'not', 'especially', 'well-handled', 'setup', 'fact', 'not', 'really', 'handled', 'then', 'expatriate', 'Babette', 'French', 'lottery', 'everything', 'starts', 'getting', 'fun.From', 'there', 'movie', 'foodie', 'dream', 'episode', 'Iron', 'Chef', 'where', 'only', 'one', 'competitor', 'blaze', 'buying', 'cooking', 'serving', 'eating', 'subtle', 'digs', 'conventions', 'time', 'are', 'obvious', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'setup', 'anything', 'other', 'knowing', 'who', 'table', 'Wonderful', 'other', 'words', 'watch', 'last', 'hour', 'film', 'be', 'entertained', 'first', 'half-hour', 'more', 'dragging', 'naked', 'glacier', '**']",Babette's Feast VHS

246925,AY3AVLL5IWW9,6301216156,Russell Fanelli,"[8, 9]","Babette's Feast demonstrates one advantage the motion picture has over all other art forms.  As the feast that gives the film its name progresses, we watch the reaction of each of the guests at the table to each new culinary delight served by the chef, Babette.  These rough and common folk have been taught that heaven should be the focus of their lives, not the pleasures of this world, and they learn at this feast the lesson of Saint Francis that God's gifts are meant to be enjoyed in the here and now.  At first the guests doubt themselves.  Can food really be this good?  As each dish is served we watch with utter delight ourselves as they realize that a bit of heaven has been served up to them free of charge in this world.  Additionally, something more profound occurs. The love Babette puts in to her gift of this banquet to repay the two sisters who take her in to their home when she was in need of help repairs old wounds and annimosities and the people at the table learn that forgiveness, like good food, is something to be practiced and shared in this world.Babette's Feast is a film to be viewed more tnan once.

How could a Danish movie about a dinner be all that compelling?  I finally broke down and rented it - and watched it, stunned.  This is truly a great film.The story is simple.  Two pious Danish sisters hire a French maid, Babette, out of a sense of charity.  Fourteen years later, Babette wins the lottery.  Out of her winnings, she proposes to serve the sisters and their fellow religionists a meal.The film is simple.  And like all things that are truly simple, it is a very, very rich feast.The film can be enjoyed on many levels, but it is an overtly Christian film; and the feast is the Lord's Supper.  Babette's gift to the sisters and their community is the gift of grace.  Unasked for, unearned, and of inestimable value.The sisters were daughters of a stern Protestant who had formed a devout community.  When the sisters were young and beautiful, they were each tempted by the chance to have great love and success outside their community.  But they remained loyal to their father and their faith.  After their father died, they carried on with their faith community.  But as the years passed by, bickering and dissension set in.One rainy day, there is a knock on the door and Babette appears in their doorway.  She has a letter of introduction from one of the sister's old love, and they decide to take her in.  Babette quietly makes herself indispensable to the sisters and the entire village.  One day, she wins the lottery, and the sisters assume that she will now leave them.  Before leaving them, however, she insists on serving them a proper French meal.The meal itself is the center of the film, and during that meal all the threads of the film are richly woven together.  The pious sisters and their community finally learn the true depths of faith - something which is more than just what we believe, but rather also reflects what we do and the love with which we do it.  They are twelve to supper, and that number is no accident.  Nor is the grace that flows through that meal.  Any Christian can appreciate its significance.  And anyone who loves the Eucharist can only smile in joy, when one of the guests identifies the main dish as ""Caille en Sarcophage"" (Quail in a sarcophagus.)  He retails a story of the time he ate this extraordinary meal in a fine Parisian restaurant.  The other guests smile, but miss his drift.  And he exclaims, ""But this really *is* Caille en Sarcophage!""  They still do not understand, but the meal works its magic nonetheless.This is a film of the sacramental vision - God's rich love reaching out to us body and soul.",5,But this really *is* Caille en Sarcophage!,1025654400,"07 3, 2002",2002,2649,"['years', 'had', 'heard', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'resisted', 'seeing', 'How', 'could', 'Danish', 'movie', 'dinner', 'be', 'compelling', 'finally', 'broke', 'down', 'rented', 'watched', 'stunned', 'truly', 'great', 'film.The', 'story', 'simple', 'Two', 'pious', 'Danish', 'sisters', 'hire', 'French', 'maid', 'Babette', 'sense', 'charity', 'Fourteen', 'years', 'later', 'Babette', 'lottery', 'winnings', 'serve', 'sisters', 'fellow', 'meal.The', 'film', 'simple', 'things', 'are', 'truly', 'simple', 'very', 'very', 'rich', 'feast.The', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'many', 'levels', 'overtly', 'Christian', 'film', 'feast', 'Lord', 'Supper', 'Babette', 'gift', 'sisters', 'community', 'gift', 'grace', 'Unasked', 'unearned', 'inestimable', 'value.The', 'sisters', 'were', 'daughters', 'stern', 'Protestant', 'who', 'had', 'formed', 'devout', 'community', 'When', 'sisters', 'were', 'young', 'beautiful', 'were', 'tempted', 'chance', 'have', 'great', 'love', 'success', 'community', 'remained', 'loyal', 'father', 'faith', 'father', 'died', 'carried', 'faith', 'community', 'years', 'passed', 'bickering', 'dissension', 'set', 'in.One', 'rainy', 'day', 'knock', 'door', 'Babette', 'doorway', 'letter', 'introduction', 'one', 'sister', 'old', 'love', 'decide', 'take', 'Babette', 'quietly', 'indispensable', 'sisters', 'entire', 'village', 'One', 'day', 'lottery', 'sisters', 'assume', 'will', 'now', 'leave', 'leaving', 'however', 'serving', 'proper', 'French', 'meal.The', 'meal', 'center', 'film', 'meal', 'threads', 'film', 'are', 'richly', 'woven', 'together', 'pious', 'sisters', 'community', 'finally', 'learn', 'true', 'depths', 'faith', 'something', 'more', 'just', 'what', 'believe', 'rather', 'also', 'what', 'do', 'love', 'do', 'are', 'twelve', 'supper', 'number', 'accident', 'grace', 'meal', 'Christian', 'can', 'appreciate', 'significance', 'anyone', 'who', 'Eucharist', 'can', 'only', 'smile', 'joy', 'when', 'one', 'guests', 'main', 'dish', 'Caille', 'en', 'Sarcophage', 'Quail', 'sarcophagus', 'story', 'time', 'ate', 'extraordinary', 'meal', 'fine', 'Parisian', 'restaurant', 'other', 'guests', 'smile', 'miss', 'drift', 'really', '*is*', 'Caille', 'en', 'Sarcophage', 'still', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'meal', 'magic', 'nonetheless.This', 'film', 'sacramental', 'vision', 'God', 'rich', 'love', 'reaching', 'out', 'body', 'soul']",Babette's Feast VHS

It is brilliantly simple on the surface, though most of the movie is symbolic and drives home a powerful lesson concerning gratefulness, loyalty and community among other things (thanks to the reviewers who pointed out that the feast represents the Lord's supper, though I'm not &quot;Christian&quot; I still appreciated the parallels.)Read about the plot from other reviews, I just felt that I needed to throw in my 2 cents.",5,More Than Just a &quot;Food Movie&quot;,1076544000,"02 12, 2004",2004,690,"[""'m"", 'sucker', 'food', 'films', 'quot', 'eat', 'drink', 'man', 'woman', 'quot', 'quot', 'Water', 'Chocalate', 'quot', 'etc', 'something', 'so', 'inwardley', 'satisfying', 'seeing', 'grand', 'feast', 'screen', 'seeing', 'reactions', 'one', 'touched', 'other', 'brilliantly', 'simple', 'surface', 'most', 'movie', 'symbolic', 'home', 'powerful', 'lesson', 'concerning', 'gratefulness', 'loyalty', 'community', 'other', 'things', 'thanks', 'reviewers', 'who', 'pointed', 'out', 'feast', 'Lord', 'supper', ""'m"", 'not', 'quot', 'Christian', 'quot', 'still', 'appreciated', 'parallels', 'Read', 'plot', 'other', 'reviews', 'just', 'felt', 'needed', 'throw', '2', 'cents']",Babette's Feast VHS

I would never have chosen such a theme as the basis of a movie or novel!  But this brilliant movie makes a great story of the cultured and good-hearted French woman living with the aging spinster daughters of the late pastor of a strict religious sect.  Working for these two kind ladies as a servant, the Parisian Babbette is assigned the preparation of a simple bread and beer soup as her first task--and over time we learn even to that she brings excellence.  Finally, years later, when she wins a lottery in France, the chef decides to spend the money to prepare a meal for her Danish friends that is the epitome of French haute cuisine.On the way to this meal we learn the background of these characters--that the sisters could have chosen lives much more marked by nominal success than living together in a rural village in a thatched-roof cottage.  One could have married a dashing young officer who had been billeted in their village as a sort of punishment for his rake-like habits.  The other had been discovered by a visiting Frenchman and found to be an amazing singer; she could have left Jutland and become the toast of the continent.  Regarding the former rake and erstwhile suitor, we learn of his story as well--and how what he gleaned from these simple people put him on the road to great success and status in the Danish military.The meal prepared by the French chef Babette becomes more than a meal.  By chance the successful military man ends up attending the feast, where he exchanges smiles with the woman he once courted, and reflects on his life.  My favorite scene is one such recollection--that of his life immediately after his assignment in Jutland--and of a gathering of Danish royalty in which he wins their favor by citing the religious maxims he learned in Jutland--while dancing to a chamber orchestra playing the Brahms waltz (Opus 39 No.15) that I have loved ever since those days when I would listen to my mother play it on the piano.",5,A beautiful atmosphere midst charming and deeply moving recollections,1311379200,"07 23, 2011",2011,2125,"['Who', 'would', 'think', 'story', 'female', 'Parisian', 'chef', 'living', 'exile', 'Danish', 'rural', 'Jutland', 'following', 'Franco-Prussian', 'War', 'could', 'be', 'interesting', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'chosen', 'theme', 'basis', 'movie', 'novel', 'brilliant', 'movie', 'great', 'story', 'cultured', 'good-hearted', 'French', 'woman', 'living', 'aging', 'spinster', 'daughters', 'late', 'pastor', 'strict', 'religious', 'sect', 'Working', 'two', 'kind', 'ladies', 'servant', 'Parisian', 'Babbette', 'assigned', 'preparation', 'simple', 'bread', 'beer', 'soup', 'first', 'task', 'time', 'learn', 'even', 'excellence', 'Finally', 'years', 'later', 'when', 'lottery', 'France', 'chef', 'spend', 'money', 'prepare', 'meal', 'Danish', 'friends', 'epitome', 'French', 'haute', 'cuisine.On', 'way', 'meal', 'learn', 'background', 'characters', 'sisters', 'could', 'have', 'chosen', 'lives', 'much', 'more', 'marked', 'nominal', 'success', 'living', 'together', 'rural', 'village', 'thatched-roof', 'cottage', 'One', 'could', 'have', 'married', 'dashing', 'young', 'officer', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'billeted', 'village', 'sort', 'punishment', 'rake-like', 'habits', 'other', 'had', 'been', 'discovered', 'visiting', 'Frenchman', 'found', 'be', 'amazing', 'singer', 'could', 'have', 'left', 'Jutland', 'become', 'toast', 'continent', 'Regarding', 'former', 'rake', 'erstwhile', 'suitor', 'learn', 'story', 'as', 'well', 'how', 'what', 'gleaned', 'simple', 'people', 'put', 'road', 'great', 'success', 'status', 'Danish', 'military.The', 'meal', 'prepared', 'French', 'chef', 'Babette', 'more', 'meal', 'chance', 'successful', 'military', 'man', 'up', 'attending', 'feast', 'where', 'exchanges', 'woman', 'once', 'courted', 'life', 'favorite', 'scene', 'one', 'such', 'recollection', 'life', 'immediately', 'assignment', 'Jutland', 'gathering', 'Danish', 'royalty', 'favor', 'citing', 'religious', 'maxims', 'learned', 'Jutland', 'dancing', 'chamber', 'orchestra', 'playing', 'Brahms', 'waltz', 'Opus', '39', 'No.15', 'have', 'loved', 'ever', 'days', 'when', 'would', 'listen', 'mother', 'play', 'piano']",Babette's Feast VHS

Since the passing of their revered pastor father, it is all the two women can do to keep his bickering flock together. They agree to take in Babette and make her their housekeeper, and for twenty years she serves them faithfully. Then one day she surprises the sisters by announcing that she has won the French national lottery: 10,000 francs. To show her gratitude to them, and to celebrate the upcoming anniversary of their father's passing, Babette asks to be allowed to prepare a real French meal for the sisters and their guests. They agree, and she sends away to France for the ingredients.When Babette's nephew returns with all the preparations for the meal, the plain people of the town, who have never seen such things as sea turtles and quails, suspect that she's a witch, and decide they will make no comments about the food during the meal, lest they enjoy it and become bewitched. The night of the feast is spectacular. Never have any of them tasted such divinity. One of the guests, a General who once courted one of the sisters and is still in love with her, comments about how the food tastes just like the delicacies he once enjoyed at a very famous Parisian restaurant which boasted a lady chef. Miraculously, Babette's feast heals all wounds among the pastor's congregation, and confirms the love the General has always harbored for the sister, and she for him. A very beautiful scene is the congregation outside after the feast with hands joined in a circle, singing under the stars.Afterwards, the two sisters comment that they suppose Babette will now return to France. ""I have no one there anymore,"" she tells them. ""Besides, I have no money to return."" ""But the 10,000 francs you won!"" they contend. Then Babette confesses that she was the famous female chef to which the General eluded, and that a meal at her restaurant for that number of people would have cost exactly 10,000 francs. This is a wonderful, beautiful film that is an allegory of the Lord's Supper, and an example of God's grace and love. If you like food, you will love every delicious detail of the feast. The film is subtitled for English, but also includes a dubbed version which I would not recommend because I think the film loses much through it. Endure the subtitles - it will be worth it.
