720447,A3BXKZ89LDCWD1,B00006LPDG,Algernon,"[30, 30]","I've had this DVD for about a year, and it has consistently remained one of my favorites. It's a solid, tough workout. At 30 minutes long, it includes chunks of plyometric moves - meaning jumps and hops that I find invigorating but might be tough for those with bad knees. The workout is broken up into a handful of segments. It gradually increases in difficulty, peaks, then lightens back up. Only the last segment seems to drag. (Tamilee says, ""We're almost done ..."" as though she's winding down, only to begin the set anew instead.) I always break a sweat with this video. Tamilee is one of my favorite instructors (and, as my husband will attest, I'm something of a workout DVD-aholic, so I've tried many!)This instructor is no-nonsense, but still polite. She even says things like, ""Two more, please,"" which keeps me liking her. Her two sidekicks, meanwhile, have no personality whatsoever. Luckily, they don't detract from the workout; they just don't add to it. In the end, my use of this video has been somewhat sporadic. I'll use it a few times a week for several months, then forget about it for a month or two before dusting it back off. The bottom line, though, is that I always come back to it. It's a solid, straightforward cardio routine.",4,"Solid, straighforward cardio",1110326400,"03 9, 2005",2005,1254,"[""'ve"", 'had', 'DVD', 'year', 'consistently', 'remained', 'one', 'favorites', 'solid', 'tough', 'workout', '30', 'minutes', 'long', 'chunks', 'plyometric', 'moves', 'meaning', 'jumps', 'find', 'invigorating', 'might', 'be', 'tough', 'bad', 'knees', 'workout', 'broken', 'up', 'handful', 'segments', 'gradually', 'difficulty', 'peaks', 'then', 'back', 'up', 'Only', 'last', 'segment', 'drag', 'Tamilee', ""'re"", 'almost', 'done', 'winding', 'down', 'only', 'begin', 'set', 'anew', 'instead', 'always', 'break', 'sweat', 'video', 'Tamilee', 'one', 'favorite', 'instructors', 'husband', 'will', 'attest', ""'m"", 'something', 'workout', 'DVD-aholic', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'many', 'instructor', 'no-nonsense', 'still', 'polite', 'even', 'things', 'Two', 'more', 'please', 'liking', 'two', 'sidekicks', 'meanwhile', 'have', 'personality', 'whatsoever', 'Luckily', 'do', ""n't"", 'detract', 'workout', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'add', 'end', 'use', 'video', 'been', 'somewhat', 'sporadic', ""'ll"", 'use', 'few', 'times', 'week', 'several', 'months', 'then', 'forget', 'month', 'two', 'dusting', 'back', 'bottom', 'line', 'always', 'come', 'back', 'solid', 'straightforward', 'cardio', 'routine']",N/A
720448,A1YYPGHTQ3JUYE,B00006LPDG,Cat,"[0, 0]","This is my first Tamilee video, and I am very happy with it.  The moves are fun and really work your core, buns & thighs.  Before purchasing the dvd I read that some of the reviewers thought it was too easy - I was skeptical at first but purchased it anyway.  I agree that it CAN be easy if you do not put your all into it - if you really get into it and add tons of energy you WILL get a great workout.  The moves are very energizing and FUN ~ my only tip is to not use this more than two times per week, because some of the moves are repetitious and you could get bored if you used this as your primary source for exercise.  I love repetition, because this is how you get the quickest results - but I also like to mix and match vids every week to always make my week of exercise interesting and inspiring.  Highly recommended!!!!",4,This is a fun one... that really works,1151020800,"06 23, 2006",2006,831,"['first', 'Tamilee', 'video', 'am', 'very', 'happy', 'moves', 'are', 'fun', 'really', 'work', 'core', 'thighs', 'purchasing', 'dvd', 'read', 'reviewers', 'thought', 'was', 'too', 'easy', 'was', 'skeptical', 'first', 'purchased', 'anyway', 'agree', 'CAN', 'be', 'easy', 'do', 'not', 'put', 'really', 'get', 'add', 'tons', 'energy', 'WILL', 'get', 'great', 'workout', 'moves', 'are', 'very', 'energizing', 'FUN', '~', 'only', 'tip', 'not', 'use', 'more', 'two', 'times', 'week', 'moves', 'are', 'repetitious', 'could', 'get', 'bored', 'used', 'primary', 'source', 'exercise', 'love', 'repetition', 'how', 'get', 'quickest', 'results', 'also', 'like', 'mix', 'match', 'vids', 'week', 'always', 'make', 'week', 'exercise', 'interesting', 'inspiring', 'Highly', 'recommended']",N/A
