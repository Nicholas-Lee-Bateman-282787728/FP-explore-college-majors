110042,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,0790742403,Acute Observer,"[0, 1]","I Confess, 1953 filmThe film takes place in Quebec, and shows a body on the floor. A man is shown walking down the street. A priest sees a man enter the church who then makes a confession for his sin of murder during a burglary. He wanted $2,000 to start a new life. Father Michael Logan heard Keller's confession, and cannot reveal this secret. We see the legislature discuss political questions like equal pay for women teachers. Two young girls saw a priest (a man wearing a cassock) leaving Mr. Villette's house, but can't identify the man. The police investigate to find who had been out late Tuesday night. Father Logan had been in the war and won the Military Cross. He alone can't give an alibi for his time that night. Inspector LaRue now has a suspect!We learn there was a romantic triangle where a wife was in love with Father Logan. She meets him in a public place, and offers to give him an alibi. But this would break up an indissoluble marriage! Father Logan chose to be what he is and can't marry her. Mrs. Ruth Grandfer was being blackmailed by that murdered lawyer, who knew of her past association with Michael Logan, and the amazing coincidences with that murdered man. Mr. Villette was threatening to reveal her past. Ruth had told this to Father Logan before the death. [Ruth seems to bring trouble to her male companions.] The scene at the rectory shows a pre-1977 Canada where anyone can own a pistol (their crime rate was lower).The trial shows the testimony of the witnesses. The pieces of the puzzle are placed together. The prosecutor suggests the relationship between Father Logan and Ruth provided a motive for murder. The all male jury returns a not guilty verdict due to the lack of evidence! The judge uses English Law to declare his opinion of the verdict. The crowd shows their disbelief in the verdict, being swayed by their emotional need for a sacrificial victim. Otto's wife Ann goes to talk to Father Logan, but her husband shoots her! Now the police realize there is another suspect. Otto is cornered, and shot by the police, but has time for his last confession.There is no mention of the resulting scandal. Someone found not guilty will always be suspect by many (Lizzie Borden, OJ Simpson, Robert Blake). Wrongful convictions are almost always due to mistaken eyewitness identification, and that is all they had in this case. (No fingerprints? No traced money?) The motive is created in the minds of the police. But Father Logan was a likely suspect. [This case of an accused killer who can't tell of his alibi reminds me of Joe Hill.] Even those with an alibi aren't always believed. They are often with friends and family whose testimony is suspect. A cynic might wonder if Father Logan used the German refugee (knowing his past) to eliminate a blackmailer by suggesting he work for Mr. Villette. The intellectual puzzles in this film might have prevented commercial success in those days.",5,A Tangled Web of Deception,1255996800,"10 20, 2009",2009,2935,"['Confess', '1953', 'filmThe', 'film', 'place', 'Quebec', 'body', 'floor', 'man', 'shown', 'walking', 'down', 'street', 'priest', 'man', 'enter', 'church', 'who', 'then', 'confession', 'sin', 'murder', 'burglary', 'wanted', '2,000', 'start', 'new', 'life', 'Father', 'Michael', 'Logan', 'heard', 'Keller', 'confession', 'can', 'not', 'reveal', 'secret', 'see', 'legislature', 'discuss', 'political', 'questions', 'equal', 'pay', 'women', 'teachers', 'Two', 'young', 'girls', 'saw', 'priest', 'man', 'wearing', 'cassock', 'leaving', 'Mr.', 'Villette', 'house', 'ca', ""n't"", 'identify', 'man', 'police', 'investigate', 'find', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'out', 'late', 'Tuesday', 'night', 'Father', 'Logan', 'had', 'been', 'war', 'won', 'Military', 'Cross', 'alone', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'alibi', 'time', 'night', 'Inspector', 'LaRue', 'now', 'suspect', 'learn', 'was', 'romantic', 'triangle', 'where', 'wife', 'was', 'love', 'Father', 'Logan', 'public', 'place', 'give', 'alibi', 'would', 'break', 'up', 'indissoluble', 'marriage', 'Father', 'Logan', 'chose', 'be', 'what', 'ca', ""n't"", 'marry', 'Mrs.', 'Ruth', 'Grandfer', 'was', 'being', 'blackmailed', 'murdered', 'lawyer', 'who', 'knew', 'past', 'association', 'Michael', 'Logan', 'amazing', 'coincidences', 'murdered', 'man', 'Mr.', 'Villette', 'was', 'threatening', 'reveal', 'past', 'Ruth', 'had', 'told', 'Father', 'Logan', 'death', 'Ruth', 'bring', 'trouble', 'male', 'companions', ']', 'scene', 'rectory', 'pre-1977', 'Canada', 'where', 'anyone', 'can', 'own', 'pistol', 'crime', 'rate', 'was', 'lower', '.The', 'trial', 'testimony', 'witnesses', 'pieces', 'puzzle', 'are', 'placed', 'together', 'prosecutor', 'relationship', 'Father', 'Logan', 'Ruth', 'provided', 'motive', 'murder', 'male', 'jury', 'returns', 'not', 'guilty', 'verdict', 'due', 'lack', 'evidence', 'judge', 'English', 'Law', 'declare', 'opinion', 'verdict', 'crowd', 'disbelief', 'verdict', 'being', 'swayed', 'emotional', 'need', 'sacrificial', 'victim', 'Otto', 'wife', 'Ann', 'talk', 'Father', 'Logan', 'husband', 'Now', 'police', 'realize', 'suspect', 'Otto', 'cornered', 'shot', 'police', 'time', 'last', 'confession.There', 'mention', 'resulting', 'scandal', 'Someone', 'found', 'not', 'guilty', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'suspect', 'many', 'Lizzie', 'Borden', 'OJ', 'Simpson', 'Robert', 'Blake', 'Wrongful', 'convictions', 'are', 'almost', 'always', 'due', 'mistaken', 'eyewitness', 'identification', 'had', 'case', 'fingerprints', 'traced', 'money', 'motive', 'created', 'minds', 'police', 'Father', 'Logan', 'was', 'likely', 'suspect', '[', 'case', 'accused', 'killer', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'alibi', 'Joe', 'Hill', ']', 'Even', 'alibi', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'believed', 'are', 'often', 'friends', 'family', 'testimony', 'suspect', 'cynic', 'might', 'wonder', 'Father', 'Logan', 'used', 'German', 'refugee', 'knowing', 'past', 'eliminate', 'blackmailer', 'suggesting', 'work', 'Mr.', 'Villette', 'intellectual', 'puzzles', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'prevented', 'commercial', 'success', 'days']",N/A

Such are the first words of this film, before we see a seemingly contrite face; a face known to the priest, a friend.  ""I must confess to you.  I must tell someone.  I want to make a confession,"" says this one before they go into the confessional and he then admits to a heinous crime.  Thus far (8 minutes into this black & white film) all is well.  Even a further 20 minutes in, Hitchcock is still working interesting camera angles, scenes, juxtapositions.  Unfortunately. there's not much follow-through after this.  The film thence becomes a rather simplistic vehicle whose sole purpose in stretching things out is to continue peppering the viewer with ""will he, won't he"" anticipation; will the priest herein break the sanctity of the confessional once he himself is suspected of the crime in question, or no.  Anne Baxter as a blonde doesn't help much either.  The blonde look just doesn't seem to work on her (not for this part, at least), or perhaps it's just that Baxter wasn't up to the job herein.  Mongomery Clift is far more believable as the priest, but Karl Malden, who plays the police inspector, seems just too overly anxious to collar (pardon the pun) Clift.  There you have it for this film set in Quebec (seemingly, for no apparent reason other than to throw in a bit of French here & there); another play turned into a film by Hitchcock and, as is too typical of this otherwise super talented director,  an unsuccessful effort with such adaptations.  Watch ""Dial M for Murder"" instead for Hitch's best effort in turning a play into a film; unless you just have to see everything Hitchcock has made (which is the reason I sought this film out myself).

110050,A30N4CJVI6U4XE,0790742403,"Chris Wilson ""Chris Kent""","[3, 5]","It's not easy to fault Alfred Hitchcock, the greatest director in history. He never really made a bad film (common to the greats), with an unparalleled consistency marching over decades. I was pleased to finally catch ""I Confess,"" his dark 1953 crime drama teaming him with Montgomery Clift. There's some unforgettable scenes, most notably the first 15 minutes taking place in the eerie darkness of Canadian alleys and church pews. But the film springs multiple leaks en route to a melodramatic conclusion and is one of the few Hitchcock works to have aged poorly.Filmed on location to good effect in Qu&eacute;bec, Canada, a Catholic church caretaker (O.E. Hasse) accidentally murders a neighborhood lawyer while robbing his home. He scuttles back to church adorned in a priest's cassock and confesses his sins to Father Logan (Clift). The lawyer victim was a seedy sort, blackmailing a character who secretly met Father Logan the night of the murder. Tough-as-nails Inspector Larrue (wonderfully played by Karl Malden) becomes suspicious of the young priest as evidence begins to mount against him. Due to his vows, Father Logan cannot reveal the confession, nor can he expose the reasons behind his whereabouts the night of the crime.High drama, granted. ""I Confess"" is an entertaining story that evolves with multiple revelations. It's also awkward and none too believable. While detectives are interviewing witnesses, there's a clumsy flashback involving a love affair Father Logan had with local wife Ruth Grandfort (Anne Baxter). The romance was prior to World War II, before Logan took his vows and Ruth married, but no matter. Ruth, who still painfully loves Father Logan, is trapped in a passionless marriage with brilliant lawyer Pierre (Roger Dann). It's histrionic silliness Douglas Sirk would love. I've never been a big fan of flashback sequences, even if the classicCasablancarelied on such techniques 11 years before. In ""I Confess,"" it's the moment the film unravels with too many coincidences.It's also difficult to imagine how Inspector Larrue could suspect Father Logan, when the church caretaker appears far more rattled during interviews. Even in 1953, detectives usually had a sixth sense about this stuff. Father Logan does not even remotely act guilty, though it's apparent he's hiding something. Could Larrue really be so clueless? Well, if the film is going to have suspense, yes.Legend has it Hitchcock had great difficulty working with Clift due to his Method acting style. Frankly, there wasn't a single director in history who didn't have trouble with Clift, a moodily brilliant presence (Montgomery Clift: A Biography). ""I Confess"" was his first film afterA Place in the Sunand months before his most famous performance inFrom Here to Eternity. It's a fascinating moment in time when you could look upon his amazingly attractive face before the infamous Hollywood car accident. Even with all the legend, Clift gives an oddly distant and passive performance. One could argue he was not the right actor for this role. I'm actually more of a fan of his later work inThe Young Lionsand the underratedWild River - Montgomery Clift, Lee Remick (NTSC all regions), performances wrought with uncomfortable pain and depth. Clift's life was an epic tragedy of unfulfilled potential as he struggled with addictions, disillusionment and identity. He was also notoriously finicky in his choice of roles, turning down the leads inSunset Boulevard (Special Collector's Edition)andShane. What could have been.Hitchcock said he was not happy with this film, and I can see why. There's a few scenes when his unique wit shines - the dinner party where the prosecutor balances a glass on his head and the priest's bicycle that keeps falling in the church hallway. I also like the concluding moments when Father Logan leaves the courthouse and residents slowly start forming into a hateful mob, an eerily realistic sequence having much relevance today. But ""I Confess"" ultimately feels forced, even though I was fascinated throughout.Lessor Hitchcock, but still worth your time.",3,"High melodrama, granted...",1312243200,"08 2, 2011",2011,4090,"['not', 'easy', 'fault', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'greatest', 'director', 'history', 'never', 'really', 'made', 'bad', 'film', 'common', 'greats', 'unparalleled', 'consistency', 'marching', 'over', 'decades', 'was', 'pleased', 'finally', 'catch', 'Confess', 'dark', '1953', 'crime', 'drama', 'teaming', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'unforgettable', 'scenes', 'most', 'notably', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'taking', 'place', 'eerie', 'darkness', 'Canadian', 'alleys', 'church', 'pews', 'film', 'springs', 'multiple', 'leaks', 'route', 'melodramatic', 'conclusion', 'one', 'few', 'Hitchcock', 'works', 'have', 'aged', 'poorly.Filmed', 'location', 'good', 'effect', 'Qu', 'eacute', 'Canada', 'Catholic', 'church', 'caretaker', 'O.E', 'Hasse', 'accidentally', 'neighborhood', 'lawyer', 'robbing', 'home', 'back', 'church', 'adorned', 'priest', 'cassock', 'sins', 'Father', 'Logan', 'Clift', 'lawyer', 'victim', 'was', 'seedy', 'sort', 'blackmailing', 'character', 'who', 'secretly', 'met', 'Father', 'Logan', 'night', 'murder', 'Tough-as-nails', 'Inspector', 'Larrue', 'wonderfully', 'played', 'Karl', 'Malden', 'suspicious', 'young', 'priest', 'evidence', 'mount', 'Due', 'vows', 'Father', 'Logan', 'can', 'not', 'reveal', 'confession', 'can', 'expose', 'reasons', 'whereabouts', 'night', 'crime.High', 'drama', 'granted', 'Confess', 'entertaining', 'story', 'multiple', 'revelations', 'also', 'awkward', 'none', 'too', 'believable', 'detectives', 'are', 'interviewing', 'witnesses', 'clumsy', 'flashback', 'involving', 'love', 'affair', 'Father', 'Logan', 'had', 'local', 'wife', 'Ruth', 'Grandfort', 'Anne', 'Baxter', 'romance', 'was', 'prior', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Logan', 'took', 'vows', 'Ruth', 'married', 'matter', 'Ruth', 'who', 'still', 'painfully', 'Father', 'Logan', 'trapped', 'passionless', 'marriage', 'brilliant', 'lawyer', 'Pierre', 'Roger', 'Dann', 'histrionic', 'silliness', 'Douglas', 'Sirk', 'would', 'love', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'flashback', 'sequences', 'even', 'classicCasablancarelied', 'such', 'techniques', '11', 'years', 'before', 'Confess', 'moment', 'film', 'unravels', 'too', 'many', 'coincidences.It', 'also', 'difficult', 'imagine', 'how', 'Inspector', 'Larrue', 'could', 'suspect', 'Father', 'Logan', 'when', 'church', 'caretaker', 'far', 'more', 'rattled', 'interviews', 'Even', '1953', 'usually', 'had', 'sixth', 'sense', 'stuff', 'Father', 'Logan', 'not', 'even', 'remotely', 'act', 'guilty', 'apparent', 'hiding', 'something', 'Could', 'Larrue', 'really', 'be', 'so', 'clueless', 'Well', 'film', 'going', 'have', 'suspense', 'Hitchcock', 'had', 'great', 'difficulty', 'working', 'Clift', 'due', 'Method', 'acting', 'style', 'Frankly', 'was', ""n't"", 'single', 'director', 'history', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'trouble', 'Clift', 'moodily', 'brilliant', 'presence', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'Biography', 'Confess', 'was', 'first', 'film', 'afterA', 'Place', 'Sunand', 'months', 'most', 'famous', 'performance', 'inFrom', 'Here', 'Eternity', 'fascinating', 'moment', 'time', 'when', 'could', 'look', 'amazingly', 'attractive', 'face', 'infamous', 'Hollywood', 'car', 'accident', 'Even', 'legend', 'Clift', 'oddly', 'distant', 'passive', 'performance', 'One', 'could', 'argue', 'was', 'not', 'right', 'actor', 'role', ""'m"", 'actually', 'more', 'fan', 'later', 'work', 'inThe', 'Young', 'Lionsand', 'underratedWild', 'River', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'Lee', 'Remick', 'NTSC', 'regions', 'performances', 'wrought', 'uncomfortable', 'pain', 'depth', 'Clift', 'life', 'was', 'epic', 'tragedy', 'unfulfilled', 'potential', 'struggled', 'addictions', 'disillusionment', 'identity', 'was', 'also', 'notoriously', 'finicky', 'choice', 'roles', 'turning', 'down', 'leads', 'inSunset', 'Boulevard', 'Special', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'andShane', 'What', 'could', 'have', 'been.Hitchcock', 'said', 'was', 'not', 'happy', 'film', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'few', 'scenes', 'when', 'unique', 'wit', 'shines', 'dinner', 'party', 'where', 'prosecutor', 'glass', 'head', 'priest', 'bicycle', 'falling', 'church', 'hallway', 'also', 'concluding', 'moments', 'when', 'Father', 'Logan', 'courthouse', 'residents', 'slowly', 'start', 'forming', 'hateful', 'mob', 'eerily', 'realistic', 'sequence', 'having', 'much', 'relevance', 'today', 'Confess', 'ultimately', 'forced', 'even', 'was', 'fascinated', 'throughout.Lessor', 'Hitchcock', 'still', 'time']",N/A

110055,A315K47GRB024C,0790742403,Daniel C. Markel,"[7, 8]","This review is for the 2004 Warner Brothers DVD.I've been a big fan of Hitchcock since I saw the movie ""The Birds"" in the late 1960's and since then I thought I'd seen all of his movies on either video, TV or the big screen at some movie festivals.  I recently bought the nine DVD ""Signature Collection"" and had seen all but two movies, one of which was ""I Confess"".  I really didn't know what to expect and was a bit disturbed with the artwork which shows a priest holding a beautiful woman.The storyline involves an immigrant named Otto Keller (O.E. Hasse) who works as a maintenance man in a Catholic Church in Quebec.  One night Otto comes into the cathedral and sees a priest named Father Logan (Montgomery Clift) and asks the priest hear his confessions.  Otto confesses to Father Logan that he killed someone earlier that night.  Father Logan goes to that house of the murdered man the following morning, but the police have already arrived and Logan also runs into Ruth Grandfort (Ann Baxter), a woman he knows.  The police have only one lead and it appears that some witnesses saw a priest leave the scene of the crime.  The plot thickens intensely as Father Logan becomes a primary suspect, and his credibility is challenged since he appears to be involved with a married woman yet because of his oath as a priest, he cannot divulge the confessions of the killer.  This sets up the rest of the movie for plenty drama and suspense.This was one of those movies that sticks with you long after you watch it and gives you a lot to think about.  There could be many parallels made to the life of Jesus who served and sacrificed his life for the sake of the sinners of the world (although Father Logan is in no way a Messiah).  Other allegories include being ridiculed and scorned for acts he never committed or for being compassionate and forgiving for those who've harmed him.  In all, its a story of compassion, sacrifice and love, but perhaps most of all staying true to your oath and calling, even in the face of death.  The acting was nothing extra special, but I would say Karl Maldon was the best of the bunch.  The script was superb and the picture certainly had that ""Hitchcock look"", especially in the opening segment at night.  In case anyone cares, I'm not a Roman Catholic, but a Christian who attends a protestant church, yet I found this movie very inspiring.  It was also refreshing to see a movie that wasn't trying to viciously scandalize the church as many movies do today.  This film may be more for acquired tastes, but for myself, I was thoroughly pleased with the story, and was more challenged than entertained.The DVD quality is nearly perfect for a movie this old.  The transfer is sharp and blemish-free, but seemed a tad grainy in some scenes.

110056,AMS3ONV4S5FBI,0790742403,David Baime,"[2, 4]","The performances of the primary actors are excellent, including that of Karl Malden as a tenacious detect, Montgomery Clift as the unusually innocent priest, and especially that of Anne Baxter as the woman who stays in love with a man after he has become a priest.The direction by Alfred Hitchcock was diabolically good.  You might even say, blasphemously exquisite.  Let me explain.On the surface, this film seems to be about how firm a priest could be in his faith.  Because of his priestly vows, Father Logan refuses to implicate a killer, merely because the killer has confessed to him.  The killer has the sanctuary of the priest's vows.I have no doubt that many viewers of this film, especially the faithful, would walk away from the cinema in admiration of Father Logan's adherence to his vows.However, upon closer inspection, I found that this film clearly demonstrated the true `value' of a vow.  Vows, in my opinion, are short sighted, arbitrary promises that fail to consider anything but the closest possibilities.  If a vow is taken for just reasons, what happens when the vow clashes with moral justice?  Is one to be unjust, merely to satisfy an arbitrary vow?  Of course not.  Well, not in a reasonable world.In the film, Father Logan protects the killer and even implicates himself just to be true to his vows.  Our own hearts tell us that this is wrong.  A good man should not be paying for someone else's crime and should not be protecting a criminal.The intention of the vow that Father Michael Logan took was not so that killers could confess their crimes to him and then go free.  Is there anyone who thinks otherwise?  Father Logan should go to his superiors or to the police and explain that he could not be guilty of this crime, because he knows who the real killer is.  He should see that justice is done, vow or no vow.  Justice is more important than the vow.Father Logan's crime in this film was in allowing a killer to kill again.  The blood of the second murder is on Father Logan's hands.  A rational society would prosecute Logan for this odious crime instead of admiring him for keeping a stupid vow.Isn't it obvious that if a vow or a God or a rule or a law requires one to do something unjust, then the vow, God, rule or law is itself unjust?So Hitchcock is really delivering an anti-religious theme under the guise of admiration for the faithful.

While most young men - like Bu&ntilde;uel, whom Hitchcock accepted as the only filmmaker equal to his own level (yes, modesty was obviously not taught at Saint Ignatius) - became life-long atheists, Hitchcock was shamelessly exploiting any knowledge he had of religion and, as usual, twisted it further for his own purposes. His understanding of the secrecy of confession is about as far off reality as the average US District Court's was on the secrecy in Swiss Banking Laws ...The plot runs roughly as follows: Refusing to give in to police investigators' questions of suspicion due to the seal of confession, a priest becomes the prime suspect in a murder case. Stars Montgomery Clift as Fr Michael William Logan, a Catholic priest, Anne Baxter as Ruth Grandfort, and Karl Malden as Inspector Larrue, all in very average performances. The film is based on a 1902 French play by Paul Anthelme called Nos Deux Consciences, a play Hitchcock saw in the 1930s. The screenplay was written by George Tabori.Befitting the arch-reactionary nature of its story, the movie was largely filmed on location in Qu&eacute;bec City, with numerous shots of the city landscape and interiors of its churches and other dark emblematic buildings, such as the Chteau Frontenac. Shooting took place in Hollywood and Quebec in under two months. Hitchcock had planned on using Quebec-area churches at no cost. When the local diocese read the original script, it objected to the priest's execution and rescinded its permission. When Tabori refused to change the script, Hitchcock brought in William Archibald to rewrite it. I Confess had finally one of the longest ""preproductions"" of any Hitchcock film, with almost 12 writers working on the script over an eight-year period.Continued opportunistic hypocrisy did not make this films' life easier, as a further real life anecdote shows: In the book-length interview Hitchcock/Truffaut (1967), Hitchcock said he had hired Anita Bj&ouml;rk as the female lead for I Confess, after seeing her in Miss Julie (1951). However, when Bj&ouml;rk arrived in Hollywood with her lover and their baby, Warner Bros. insisted that Hitchcock find another actress... I Confess was a favorite among French New Wave film makers, according to filmmaker/historian Peter Bogdanovich. Film critic Father Peter Malone, MSC, has described I Confess as ""the most Catholic film of Hitchcock's films.""

110060,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,0790742403,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[2, 2]","In the Catholic Church, the confession of sins has one important rule -- no matter what, the priest can never reveal what is said.As wise as this rule is, it does have a drawback --sometimes a priest is unable to report a serious crime, even though he knows who the culprit is. Alfred Hitchcock tackled this touchy situation in ""I Confess,"" a quiet little thriller that follows a young priest torn between staying true to his faith and being convicted of a crime that he didn't commit.One night, Father Michael Logan (Montgomery Clift) hears confession for his caretaker Otto Keller (O. E. Hasse). Otto's sin? He tried to rob the house of a local lawyer named Villette, and then killed Villette when he was interrupted. But despite the penance Logan gives him, Otto doesn't return the money or turn himself in, but Logan is still unable to tell the police what he knows.When a pair of girls report seeing a priest leaving the scene of the crime, Inspector Larue (Karl Malden) begins to suspect that Logan is the killer -- and his suspicions are only increased when Logan can't give himself an alibi.His ex-girlfriend Ruth (Anne Baxter), now married to a rich politician, comes forward to try to clear the name of the man she still loves.  But she inadvertently makes his situation even worse, and convinces the police that Logan is their man. The only one who can prove his innocence is Otto, the man who will do anything to save himself.""I Confess"" stands out among Alfred Hitchcock's films as the most Catholic-influenced, but it isn't really a ""religious"" film per se. It's a typical ""wrong man"" Hitchcock movie that just happens to be all about a priest and the possible consequences of sticking to his principles -- which is a pretty universal theme, in or out of religion.However, Hitchcock clearly did have great respect and fondness for Catholicism. He fills the screen with gilded altars, steeples and crosses, reminding us of what is at stake for Logan if he gives in and betrays his faith. He winds up the tension slowly and inexorably, breaking down every shred of possible evidence that could exonerate Logan -- and even if he isn't jailed or executed, his life could be utterly destroyed.However, there are some syrupy moments, such as the over-the-top luminous flashbacks of Logan and Ruth's courtship. And a few characters who seem important (such as Logan's quirky fellow priests) just sort of fade out of the story.Montgomery Clift gives a mostly excellent performance here. His beautiful face and earnest performance give him the feel of a man who is almost too good for this world, but he seems uncertain during the moments with no dialogue. Anne Baxter's performance is a bit too breathily dramatic for my taste, but Karl Malden does a good job as a cop who is furious that the answers are almost in his grasp... but just slightly out of reach.But Hasse's performance is one of the great underrated roles of a Hitchcock villain -- his pale crazy eyes bore through the screen with crazed desperation. Something darker seeps into him as time goes on, and he bounces around behind the silent Logan like a little shoulder-devil, accusing him of cowardice and taunting him with his inability to speak.""I Confess"" has some uneven moments compared to many of Hitchcock's movies, but there's a strangely personal intensity to this little ""wrong-man"" thriller.

110062,A7Y6AVS576M03,0790742403,gobirds2,"[1, 1]","I CONFESS is one of my favorite Alfred Hitchcokk films. On the surface there is the story of a Catholic priest, Father Michael Logan, who hears the confession of a man (Otto Keller) who has committed a murder. Otto Keller works at the rectory and Father Logan recognizes him. Father Logan cannot reveal what he has been told in the confessional by the the vows of his faith. In a strange twist of events, it becomes clear that Father Logan had some dealings with the murdered man and Father Logan becomes the prime suspect of the murder. It is a very good story and the web gets very complex. What impressed me was Montgomery Clift's performance as Father Logan. It is very reverent, very thoughtful and very realistic. Montgomery Clift as Father Logan is certainly a tormented man. Karl Malden as Inspector Larrue is equally impressive. The scenes between Montgomery Clift and Karl Malden are very tense and intense. Their parts, their confrontational dialogues are well written. My background is Catholic and I understand and accept the sanctity of the confessional. It is a real dilemma in one way for father Logan since he is being accused of the murder. I think this is a great film and one of Hitchcock's best. The Quebec setting and Robert Burks' beautiful black & white photography is very haunting, as haunted as Father Logan is of the position he has been placed in under the eyes of God. Dimitri Tiomkin's score also captures the beauty of Quebec and also Father Logan's torment. I think this is Montgomery Clift's best performance ever. It is sort of a forgotten film and that just adds to its haunting beauty and the torment that faith sometimes reaches out asks us to examine our own beliefs.",5,A Very Haunting Story of Faith and Conviction,1381104000,"10 7, 2013",2013,1706,"['CONFESS', 'one', 'favorite', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcokk', 'films', 'surface', 'story', 'Catholic', 'priest', 'Father', 'Michael', 'Logan', 'who', 'confession', 'man', 'Otto', 'Keller', 'who', 'committed', 'murder', 'Otto', 'Keller', 'rectory', 'Father', 'Logan', 'Father', 'Logan', 'can', 'not', 'reveal', 'what', 'been', 'told', 'confessional', 'vows', 'faith', 'strange', 'twist', 'events', 'clear', 'Father', 'Logan', 'had', 'dealings', 'murdered', 'man', 'Father', 'Logan', 'prime', 'suspect', 'murder', 'very', 'good', 'story', 'web', 'very', 'complex', 'What', 'impressed', 'was', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'performance', 'Father', 'Logan', 'very', 'reverent', 'very', 'thoughtful', 'very', 'realistic', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'Father', 'Logan', 'certainly', 'tormented', 'man', 'Karl', 'Malden', 'Inspector', 'Larrue', 'equally', 'impressive', 'scenes', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'Karl', 'Malden', 'are', 'very', 'tense', 'intense', 'parts', 'confrontational', 'dialogues', 'are', 'well', 'written', 'background', 'Catholic', 'understand', 'accept', 'sanctity', 'confessional', 'real', 'dilemma', 'one', 'way', 'father', 'Logan', 'being', 'accused', 'murder', 'think', 'great', 'film', 'one', 'Hitchcock', 'best', 'Quebec', 'setting', 'Robert', 'Burks', 'beautiful', 'black', 'white', 'photography', 'very', 'haunting', 'as', 'haunted', 'Father', 'Logan', 'position', 'been', 'placed', 'eyes', 'God', 'Dimitri', 'Tiomkin', 'score', 'also', 'beauty', 'Quebec', 'also', 'Father', 'Logan', 'torment', 'think', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'best', 'performance', 'ever', 'sort', 'forgotten', 'film', 'just', 'haunting', 'beauty', 'torment', 'faith', 'sometimes', 'out', 'asks', 'examine', 'own', 'beliefs']",N/A
110063,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,0790742403,Gregor von Kallahann,"[0, 0]","It's ironic in a sense that Hitchcock's first color film ROPE was basically an elaborately filmed stage play and limited largely to a single (patently artificial) set.  That he followed that 1948 film with black & white classics like STRANGERS ON A TRAIN and I CONFESS suggested that he was not quite ready to make the leap into fully ""opened up"" technicolor extravaganzas--and considering the ""look"" of these remarkable films, we can only be grateful and glad that that was the case.There is probably no better ""looking"" Hitchcock film than I CONFESS.  It can--and has--serve as a study of ""noirish"" cinematography unto itself.  Robert Burks' moody images of Quebec City are as beautiful as they are sinister.  Critics have often remarked on the ingeniousness of using Quebec, the most Old World looking city in the New, as the film's setting.  There's a certain irony about that choice too.  Quebec can be a lovely, colorful and ""color-filled"" city, and was likely even more so in the early '50s when this film was shot.  To see it rendered in brooding, Expressionistic black and white is, in a very real sense, quite jarring.All this atmosphere helps to make up for some of the film's structural  and dramatic flaws.  It is Hitchcock at his talkiest.  So much of the film's plotting is revealed in narrated flashback that the film begins to lose momentum quite early on.  Admittely,  it would be difficult to come up with a better expository plot device than the Anne Baxter character's lengthy police deposition.  I certainly don't have a better idea.  Nonetheless it's a fairly leaden device that goes on way too long and falls all too flat.  Luckily for the viewer, the plot twists further and her character's good intentions go horribly wrong when her attempts to provide our protagonist with an alibi are actually used against him.The plotline is fairly well known among Hitchcock buffs.  A priest (Montgomery Clift), bound by the vow of confidentiality of the confessional,  cannot divulge the identity of a murderer, even when he himself (the priest) is accused and tried for the crime.  I'm told by friends knowledgeable in church doctrine that this is certainly the case--which certainly opens up all kinds of delicious dramatic possibilities.  And Hitchcock exploits them up to a point.  There are no scenes, however, that have the priest even attempting to counsel the actual murderer that he continues to be in a grievous state of sin by not coming forward and admitting his guilt, even when another man (the priest himself) is charged with the crime.Throw in a subplot suggestive of an illicit love (of course, it's not really that--this is the '50s after all), and blackmail  and you've got all the ingredients for a corker of a story.  Well, what we get is a pretty good story, but one that was obviously sanitized and dramatically compromised in unfortunate ways.  Commentary by Peter Bogdanovich, Richard Schickel and others included in the DVD version's special features indicate all the compromises Hitchcock had to make--to censors seen and unseen (i.e. within and outside of the studio)--in order to get this film made.  From what they relate, it's easy to imagine an even more dramatic and satisfying film that the one we have.It's not at all bad, but it's not truly great.",4,A Collared Suspect,1243641600,"05 30, 2009",2009,3298,"['ironic', 'sense', 'Hitchcock', 'first', 'color', 'film', 'ROPE', 'was', 'basically', 'elaborately', 'filmed', 'stage', 'play', 'limited', 'largely', 'single', 'patently', 'artificial', 'set', 'followed', '1948', 'film', 'black', 'white', 'classics', 'STRANGERS', 'ON', 'A', 'TRAIN', 'CONFESS', 'suggested', 'was', 'not', 'quite', 'ready', 'make', 'leap', 'fully', 'opened', 'up', 'technicolor', 'extravaganzas', 'considering', 'look', 'remarkable', 'films', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'grateful', 'glad', 'was', 'case.There', 'probably', 'better', 'looking', 'Hitchcock', 'film', 'CONFESS', 'can', 'serve', 'study', 'noirish', 'cinematography', 'Robert', 'Burks', 'moody', 'images', 'Quebec', 'City', 'are', 'as', 'beautiful', 'are', 'sinister', 'Critics', 'have', 'often', 'remarked', 'ingeniousness', 'using', 'Quebec', 'most', 'Old', 'World', 'looking', 'city', 'New', 'film', 'setting', 'certain', 'irony', 'choice', 'too', 'Quebec', 'can', 'be', 'lovely', 'colorful', 'color-filled', 'city', 'was', 'likely', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'early', ""'50s"", 'when', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'see', 'rendered', 'brooding', 'Expressionistic', 'black', 'white', 'very', 'real', 'sense', 'quite', 'jarring.All', 'atmosphere', 'make', 'up', 'film', 'structural', 'dramatic', 'flaws', 'Hitchcock', 'talkiest', 'So', 'much', 'film', 'plotting', 'revealed', 'narrated', 'flashback', 'film', 'lose', 'momentum', 'quite', 'early', 'Admittely', 'would', 'be', 'difficult', 'come', 'up', 'better', 'expository', 'plot', 'device', 'Anne', 'Baxter', 'character', 'lengthy', 'police', 'deposition', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'better', 'idea', 'fairly', 'leaden', 'device', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'too', 'flat', 'Luckily', 'viewer', 'plot', 'further', 'character', 'good', 'intentions', 'go', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'when', 'attempts', 'provide', 'protagonist', 'alibi', 'are', 'actually', 'used', 'him.The', 'plotline', 'fairly', 'well', 'known', 'Hitchcock', 'buffs', 'priest', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'bound', 'vow', 'confidentiality', 'confessional', 'can', 'not', 'divulge', 'identity', 'murderer', 'even', 'when', 'priest', 'accused', 'tried', 'crime', ""'m"", 'told', 'friends', 'knowledgeable', 'church', 'doctrine', 'certainly', 'case', 'certainly', 'up', 'kinds', 'delicious', 'dramatic', 'possibilities', 'Hitchcock', 'up', 'point', 'are', 'scenes', 'however', 'have', 'priest', 'even', 'attempting', 'counsel', 'actual', 'murderer', 'be', 'grievous', 'state', 'sin', 'not', 'coming', 'forward', 'admitting', 'guilt', 'even', 'when', 'man', 'priest', 'charged', 'crime.Throw', 'subplot', 'suggestive', 'illicit', 'love', 'course', 'not', 'really', ""'50s"", 'blackmail', ""'ve"", 'got', 'ingredients', 'corker', 'story', 'Well', 'what', 'get', 'pretty', 'good', 'story', 'one', 'was', 'obviously', 'sanitized', 'dramatically', 'compromised', 'unfortunate', 'ways', 'Commentary', 'Peter', 'Bogdanovich', 'Richard', 'Schickel', 'others', 'included', 'DVD', 'version', 'special', 'features', 'indicate', 'compromises', 'Hitchcock', 'had', 'make', 'censors', 'seen', 'unseen', 'i.e', 'studio', 'order', 'get', 'film', 'made', 'what', 'relate', 'easy', 'imagine', 'even', 'more', 'dramatic', 'satisfying', 'film', 'one', 'have.It', 'not', 'bad', 'not', 'truly', 'great']",N/A

Because and despite you may regard it as a suspenseful movie, the film explores the last frontiers of what it must be done in case a secret of confession of a man who killed a blackmailer who was taking advantage about the loves of youth between the priest and a beautiful girl who is actually a married woman.The puritanical ethics of the master is carved in relief. But basically, we should understand the guiltiness about the killer is a sort of divine justice over a ruthless man who employs the defamation as a way of earning the life, no matter how the prize of this attitude may mean for other people who have nothing to do with this sin of youth.The figure of the priest in the middle of the trial is another factor of inner suspense. He has been condemned beforehand by the gaze of most of the people until the truth appears.Once  more, the public opinion like in ""Dreyfus affair"" has decided and judged according the elemental rules of the common sense. But when the jury declares him not guilty, Hitchcock bets for some who have not been blinded for the mere facts.Moreover, at the moment the truth is revealed, the respectable married woman asks his husband for leaving the sordid incident at the final sequence, carving in relief the well known statement: ""Ashes to ashes.""A very good performance of Montgomery Clift.",4,In search of unforgotten livings!,1252454400,"09 9, 2009",2009,1402,"['confess', 'one', 'weirdest', 'entries', 'master', 'suspense', 'may', 'regard', 'suspenseful', 'movie', 'film', 'last', 'frontiers', 'what', 'must', 'be', 'done', 'case', 'secret', 'confession', 'man', 'who', 'killed', 'blackmailer', 'who', 'was', 'taking', 'advantage', 'loves', 'youth', 'priest', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'who', 'actually', 'married', 'woman.The', 'puritanical', 'ethics', 'master', 'carved', 'relief', 'basically', 'should', 'understand', 'guiltiness', 'killer', 'sort', 'divine', 'justice', 'ruthless', 'man', 'who', 'defamation', 'way', 'earning', 'life', 'matter', 'how', 'prize', 'attitude', 'may', 'mean', 'other', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'sin', 'youth.The', 'figure', 'priest', 'middle', 'trial', 'factor', 'inner', 'suspense', 'been', 'condemned', 'beforehand', 'gaze', 'most', 'people', 'truth', 'appears.Once', 'more', 'public', 'opinion', 'Dreyfus', 'affair', 'decided', 'judged', 'according', 'elemental', 'rules', 'common', 'sense', 'when', 'jury', 'not', 'guilty', 'Hitchcock', 'bets', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'blinded', 'mere', 'facts.Moreover', 'moment', 'truth', 'revealed', 'respectable', 'married', 'woman', 'husband', 'leaving', 'sordid', 'incident', 'final', 'sequence', 'carving', 'relief', 'well', 'known', 'statement', 'Ashes', 'ashes', 'very', 'good', 'performance', 'Montgomery', 'Clift']",N/A
110065,A192KEPM0HW6AC,0790742403,"Interplanetary Funksmanship ""Swift lippin', e...","[30, 31]","Hitch had made many ""wrong man"" movies prior to and after this, such as ""The 39 Steps,"" ""Saboteur,"" ""North by Northwest,"" and of course, ""The Wrong Man."" What separates this from all the rest is that the movie's protagonist, Father Michael Logan, does not embark on a sudden cross-country quest to find the real murderer. In fact, the murderer -- German refugee Otto Keller -- is right under Father Logan's very nose all along, and Logan knows his guilt, because Keller has confessed the murder to Logan forthrightly.Thus the suspense here results from the crisis of conscience Logan is put through, and few celluloid heroes have been put through the wringer the way Montgomery Clift's has been. His is a crucial moral dilemma: Divulge Keller's confession and get himself off the hook, or stay silent and perhaps be hanged.Though Hitchcock held Stanislavsky ""method"" actors in disdain (Clift made shooting difficult, constantly defering to his acting coach on the set), he clearly could spot a great actor when he saw one. Montgomery Clift's portrayal of Logan complex and heartfelt. He invests his character with thoroughly believable intellect and emotion, and gives one of the greatest performances of a man of integrity the screen has ever seen. The viewer can easily empathize with him and the incredible pressure he must be under. Yet, the message is clear: Father Logan is a man of the true faith -- for by keeping true to the sacrament of confession, he keeps his soul intact and demonstrates his unyielding belief in the salvation of even the most tainted of souls, Keller's.The tension is even further racheted up a notch, because as Keller fears the police closing in, he badgers and taunts Logan, accusing him of cowardice, suspecting him of breaking. The study in contrasts could not be greater. O.E. Hasse (ironically, ""hasse"" being the German word for ""hate"") exudes hate as the ratty instigator Keller. He definitely belongs in the patheon of evil Hitchcockian villians, like Norman Bates, Bruno Anthony, Mrs. Danvers and Madame Sebastian.Anne Baxter, Karl Malden and Brian Aherne round out the cast with great performances. Baxter is conflicted and gorgeous as the married woman still enamored with Logan, who loved her before he assumed his priestly vows; Malden is nimble and self-assured as the detective who finds that the evidence points to Logan; Aherne is smarmy and vicious as the Crown prosecutor who goes after Logan tooth and nail. Dolly Haas, the great German stage actress, is thoroughly believeable as Keller's wife. Throughout the movie, she -- knowing her husband's murder -- acts like a scared rabbit, which is doubly ironic, since ""Haas"" is Dutch for ""hare""!""I Confess"" was shot on location in Quebec City, and does for its vistas what ""Vertigo"" did for San Francisco. DP Robert Burks, helming his second Hitchcock film, paints the French-Canadian city in shades of shimmering white and charcoal black. His camerawork evokes the Gothic majesty of its cathedrals and Christian iconography, placing Father Logan in a deceptively sympathetic visual context while imprisoning him within the shadows of its dank cobblestones and Keller's skulking presence.The great and unheralded Russian composer Dimitri Tiomkin -- who scored more Hitchcock soundtracks than any other composer except Bernard Herrmann -- builds an equally dark and evocative score around the Catholic ""Dies Irae"" chant that summons up both doom and judgment, echoing Liszt's ""Totentanz"" and Rachmaninoff's ""Die Toteninsel.""There are many who consider this one of Hitchcock's minor classics. I could not disagree more: ""I Confess"" is definitely one of the Master of Suspense's greatest films, an underrated masterwork, akin to Orson Welles' ""Touch of Evil"" or Billy Wilder's ""Ace in the Hole.""

This priest had been the receiver of a murder confession, and now he is haunted with the knowledge yet unable to do anything about it in his loyalty to his priestly vows.The complications to the story are feasible and suspenseful, and the resolution works out logically. I was very pleased with this film as a refreshingly ""different yet same"" film from the best suspense director of all time.Play close attention to the ironic last line muttered to ""Father Logan.""",4,Neat little Hitchcock!,1154304000,"07 31, 2006",2006,876,"['call', 'little', 'Hitchcock', 'lesser', 'known', 'short', 'film', 'directed', 'Master', 'have', 'seen', 'majority', 'Hitchcocks', 'films', 'consider', 'fan', 'yet', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'one', 'two', 'days', 'ago', 'was', 'very', 'pleasantly', 'surprised.Montgomery', 'Clift', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'role', 'priest', 'caught', 'rock', 'hard', 'place', 'turmoil', 'role', 'was', 'played', 'perfectly', 'priest', 'had', 'been', 'receiver', 'murder', 'confession', 'now', 'haunted', 'knowledge', 'yet', 'unable', 'do', 'anything', 'loyalty', 'priestly', 'vows.The', 'complications', 'story', 'are', 'feasible', 'suspenseful', 'resolution', 'out', 'logically', 'was', 'very', 'pleased', 'film', 'refreshingly', 'different', 'yet', 'same', 'film', 'best', 'suspense', 'director', 'time.Play', 'close', 'attention', 'ironic', 'last', 'line', 'muttered', 'Father', 'Logan']",N/A
110067,A22BPC7LRSGSYQ,0790742403,Joker,"[1, 1]","I Confess (1953) stars Montgomery Clift, Anne Baxter, and Karl Malden.  This is one of the more or less ""forgotten"" Hitchcock movies from the 1950s, though it is good and severely underrated, probably because it was made during the decade of Hitchcock's greatest triumphs.  This movie has always been lumped into the category of ""lesser Hitchcock"", but I think it's a very good movie.  Basically the movie is about a Catholic priest who is suspected of murder all while knowing that the real murderer confessed the crime to him, but he'll stop at nothing to protect the person.  This movie has the trademark Hitchcock suspense.  It also has the same story/plot as many of Hitchcock's movies - an innocent man wrongly accused, in this case, a priest.  Shot on location in Quebec City, this movie's atmosphere oozes the feel of an Old World city that's in the New World.  The atmosphere and cinematography is dark and shadowy with excellent use of lighting and excellent shots of the churches and religious symbols, not to mention great camera angles.  This movie definitely falls into the film noir category.  The acting is good.  Montgomery Clift plays the role of the Catholic priest in a very convincing and believable way.  Anne Baxter is solid throughout.  Karl Malden is great as well.The musical score by Dimitri Tiomkin is good.If you want to see a largely forgotten but good Hitchcock movie from his golden period of the 1950s, then I highly recommend watching I Confess.UPDATE 5/11/14 - After watching this movie many times in the last month or so, my evaluation of it has changed.

Galbratith, ""Demographics tell the story of the decline of the Quebec's Roman Church [sic]. The province-wide rate of church attendance, which, prior to the 1960s ranged between 80 to 90 percent, has now plunged to below eight percent....The decline of church authority is also reflected in the province's record-low birth rate, increased abortion rate, single parent homes, divorce rates, and reluctance to marry.""  Hence to a modern person watchingI Confess, the place of the Catholic Church in Quebec City's culture may seem very strange.  Yet despite the esteem in which clergy of that time and place were apparently held, Hitchcock also depicts a mob mentality, ready to believe the worst of our fellow human beings - maybe especially of those who dare to try to model and teach morality.I Confesshinges on the seal of confession, which absolutely prohibits priests from revealing anything which they learn in the Sacrament of Confession (Sacrament of Reconciliation).

110072,A6ADO7B6FUVN,0790742403,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[3, 3]","Every time Alfred Hitchcock made a film, he offered a unique and intriguing experience even though some of his films never reached the same glory as Rebecca (1940), Notorious (1946), and Vertigo (1958).  One of these smaller films is I Confess (1951); however, it still carries the Hitchcockian trademark of visual brilliance with which he mesmerizes an audience.  Nonetheless, I Confess offers a great story that plays strongly with visual and social symbolism while Hitchcock emphasizes the different views of society through strong contrasts.  The black and white photography enhances these strong contrasts, as it offers much for the audience to ponder.The opening scene brings to mind the opening in Citizen Kane (1941), but here the scene has a completely different symbolical meaning.  There is a lower angle shot of a castle with the sky in the background and a small city in the foreground.  The black and white photography creates a concentrated contrast, as the castle appears almost black.  Simultaneously, apprehensive music plays in the background which enhances the ominous atmosphere, as several cuts display directional arrows stating, ""Direction"".  These scenes also inform that the story takes place in Canada, later it discloses its exact location, Quebec.  Eventually these arrows guide the audience through an open window into a room where a body lays lifeless on the floor while a moving door drapes moves suggesting that someone recently left the room.  Strikingly, the audience will recognize the person who left as the murderer, as the viewer's curiosity grows exponentially.Through the eye of the camera, the audience gets to follow this dubious character dressed in a long dark robe, as the person enters a Catholic church while the film's protagonist, Father Logan (Montgomery Clift), observes the person entering the church.  Father Logan makes his way to the sanctuary to see who it is, as he finds a troubled man who confesses to him that he has just killed a man.  For those who do not know, the rules of the Sacrament of the Confession state that Father Logan cannot reveal anything from a confession.  This reasoning stems from the idea that what a person shares with the priest is only a matter between the person seeking absolution and God, as the priest merely functions a sounding board.  Thus, the knowledge that Father Logan acquires that evening in the sanctuary must remain a secret, as long as he wants to remain a priest for the Catholic Church.The story unfolds in a subtle and delicate manner, as if a whisper could ruin the whole scenario.  However, no whisper breaks the fragile thread on which the audience ventures through Hitchcock's masterful artistry.  Yet, the audience waits in deep suspenseful anticipation that Father Logan will spill the beans in regards to his sinister knowledge.  Instead, the story becomes more intricate, as further details begin to taint the truth.  Cleverly, Hitchcock displays his understanding for society and the psychology of the audience, as he makes Father Logan appear as both a villain and a saint.  This is also evident throughout the film, as Hitchcock frames several scenes in a way that expresses the notion of Father Logan's duality.Hitchcock's I Confess offers a stunning cinematic journey where the true mystery does not rest within a murder.  No, the true mystery in this film appears through the mirror of the society that Hitchcock creates by overtly displaying stereotypes and social generalizations.  These generalizations transfer negative thoughts in the perception of Christian morality, and even the audience becomes engrossed in these thoughts, as Hitchcock shrewdly weaves the script, cast, mise-en-scene, and camera work into one potent concoction where no one will be untouched.  Despite being a small film, I Confess displays Hitchcock's cinematic genius and leaves the audience with a compelling story to ponder for some time.",5,Dramatic Hitchcock on the Highest Level in Small Film...,1116374400,"05 18, 2005",2005,3938,"['time', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'made', 'film', 'offered', 'unique', 'intriguing', 'experience', 'even', 'films', 'never', 'reached', 'same', 'glory', 'Rebecca', '1940', 'Notorious', '1946', 'Vertigo', '1958', 'One', 'smaller', 'films', 'Confess', '1951', 'however', 'still', 'Hitchcockian', 'trademark', 'visual', 'brilliance', 'audience', 'Nonetheless', 'Confess', 'great', 'story', 'strongly', 'visual', 'social', 'symbolism', 'Hitchcock', 'different', 'views', 'society', 'strong', 'contrasts', 'black', 'white', 'photography', 'enhances', 'strong', 'contrasts', 'much', 'audience', 'ponder.The', 'opening', 'scene', 'brings', 'mind', 'opening', 'Citizen', 'Kane', '1941', 'here', 'scene', 'completely', 'different', 'symbolical', 'meaning', 'lower', 'angle', 'shot', 'castle', 'sky', 'background', 'small', 'city', 'foreground', 'black', 'white', 'photography', 'concentrated', 'contrast', 'castle', 'almost', 'black', 'Simultaneously', 'apprehensive', 'music', 'plays', 'background', 'ominous', 'atmosphere', 'several', 'cuts', 'display', 'directional', 'arrows', 'stating', 'Direction', 'scenes', 'also', 'inform', 'story', 'place', 'Canada', 'later', 'exact', 'location', 'Quebec', 'Eventually', 'arrows', 'guide', 'audience', 'open', 'window', 'room', 'where', 'body', 'lifeless', 'floor', 'moving', 'door', 'moves', 'suggesting', 'someone', 'recently', 'left', 'room', 'Strikingly', 'audience', 'will', 'recognize', 'person', 'who', 'left', 'murderer', 'viewer', 'curiosity', 'eye', 'camera', 'audience', 'follow', 'dubious', 'character', 'dressed', 'long', 'dark', 'robe', 'person', 'Catholic', 'church', 'film', 'protagonist', 'Father', 'Logan', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'person', 'entering', 'church', 'Father', 'Logan', 'way', 'sanctuary', 'see', 'who', 'troubled', 'man', 'who', 'just', 'killed', 'man', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'rules', 'Sacrament', 'Confession', 'state', 'Father', 'Logan', 'can', 'not', 'reveal', 'anything', 'confession', 'reasoning', 'idea', 'what', 'person', 'shares', 'priest', 'only', 'matter', 'person', 'seeking', 'absolution', 'God', 'priest', 'merely', 'sounding', 'board', 'Thus', 'knowledge', 'Father', 'Logan', 'evening', 'sanctuary', 'must', 'remain', 'secret', 'as', 'long', 'remain', 'priest', 'Catholic', 'Church.The', 'story', 'unfolds', 'subtle', 'delicate', 'manner', 'whisper', 'could', 'ruin', 'whole', 'scenario', 'However', 'whisper', 'fragile', 'thread', 'audience', 'ventures', 'Hitchcock', 'masterful', 'artistry', 'audience', 'waits', 'deep', 'suspenseful', 'anticipation', 'Father', 'Logan', 'will', 'spill', 'beans', 'regards', 'sinister', 'knowledge', 'Instead', 'story', 'more', 'intricate', 'further', 'details', 'begin', 'taint', 'truth', 'Cleverly', 'Hitchcock', 'understanding', 'society', 'psychology', 'audience', 'Father', 'Logan', 'appear', 'villain', 'saint', 'also', 'evident', 'film', 'Hitchcock', 'several', 'scenes', 'way', 'notion', 'Father', 'Logan', 'duality.Hitchcock', 'Confess', 'stunning', 'cinematic', 'journey', 'where', 'true', 'mystery', 'not', 'rest', 'murder', 'No', 'true', 'mystery', 'film', 'mirror', 'society', 'Hitchcock', 'creates', 'overtly', 'displaying', 'stereotypes', 'social', 'generalizations', 'generalizations', 'transfer', 'negative', 'thoughts', 'perception', 'Christian', 'morality', 'even', 'audience', 'engrossed', 'thoughts', 'Hitchcock', 'shrewdly', 'script', 'cast', 'mise-en-scene', 'camera', 'work', 'one', 'potent', 'concoction', 'where', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'untouched', 'being', 'small', 'film', 'Confess', 'Hitchcock', 'cinematic', 'genius', 'audience', 'compelling', 'story', 'ponder', 'time']",N/A

110079,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,0790742403,mirasreviews,"[1, 1]","Inspired by Paul Anthelme's 1902 play ""Nos Deux Consciences"" and filmed in Qu&eacute;bec City, ""I Confess"" is one of Alfred Hitchcock's most visually expressive films. It's the story of Catholic priest Father Michael Logan (Montgomery Clift) who hears the confession of a parishioner, Otto Keller (Otto Eduard Hasse), a recent immigrant who works at the rectory alongside his wife Alma (Dolly Haas). Keller confesses to killing a Mr. Villette in the course of robbing him. It happens that Logan had some business with Villette, and his evasive answers and surreptitious relationship with Ruth Grandfort (Anne Baxter), the wife of a prominent politician, arouse the suspicions of the investigating detective, Inspector Larrue (Karl Malden). But Logan can't say what he knows about the murder, as it would violate the sanctity of the confessional.This was one of Alfred Hitchcock's first experiences with ""Method"" actors, whom he always thought a bit nutty. Montgomery Clift's palpable angst works well here, though, as Father Logan must internalize his fears, desires, his knowledge of the crime, and his growing distaste for Mr. Keller. There is a trio of good performances. Anne Baxter evokes the audience's empathy for Ruth, who at first seems like a shallow, icy blond. Her secrets and efforts to protect Michael eventually come pouring out. The German actor Otto Eduard Hasse steals some scenes from Clift. It's a small part, but, with few lines, Hasse moves the audience from regarding Keller as a fool to thinking him a real creep. The visual style is unusually extreme for Hitchcock, with high contrast and canted angles that express the characters' inner turmoil. Extroverted visuals for the film's introverted action.The DVD (Warner 2004): There are 3 bonus features. ""Hitchcock's Confession: A Look at I Confess"" (20 min) interviews director Peter Bogdanovich, Hitchcock historian Bill Krohn, film historians Richard Schickel and Robert Osborne, Montgomery Clift's friend, the actor Jack Larson, and more about Hitchcock's adaptation of the Anthelme play, the influence of his Jesuit education, the locations, Clift's acting style, how critics regarded the film.

110080,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,0790742403,M. Oleson,"[1, 1]","This underappreciated film from Alfred Hitchcock escaped me until now.  Set and mostly filmed in Montreal, it features an early performance from Montgomery Clift.  He plays a priest, ordained only 2 years earlier.  Hitchcock opens the film in a nighttime setting giving him an opportunity to film in low light, complete with beautiful architecture, mysterious shadows and a lone man wearing a cassock quickly leaving the house of a man we saw seconds earlier slumped over a table.It turns out to be Otto (O. E. Hasse), a German immigrant who works for the church along with his wife Alma (a rare appearance by famed German actress Dolly Haas).  Father Michael (Clift), seeing someone enter the church from his bedroom window hurries down to see what's what.  Otto insists on confessing his sins and in the process tells Father Michael he had killed the man during a robbery.  Michael, sworn to the secrecy of the confession, is eventually implicated, charged and tried for the murder.  Why?  Stay with me.Many years earlier, seen in flashback, Michael had a love affair with Ruth (Ann Baxter, in mandatory Hitchcock blonde hair).  Called to war, Michael was gone for 2 years.  In the meantime, Ruth married Pierre, a wealthy politician.  When she learns of Michael's return, she goes to meet him.  They get caught in a driving rainstorm and stay the night in a nearby Gazebo, where they are discovered by the man who was killed years later.  He was in fact blackmailing Ruth about the hookup, although we are never certain how far the liaison progressed romantically.  Father Michael was going to confront the man the morning of his death.The movie has much going for it.  The photography is excellent throughout thanks to Robert Burks and Hitchcock's vision.  While Baxter's performance seemed a bit melodramatic at times, the rest of the cast is on top of their game.  Clift's acting style caused some controversy at the time as he was an early proponent of the ""method"" school.  I found him terribly sympathetic and spot on.  Likewise, Karl Malden as the primary police inspector and Brian Aherne as the Crown's prosecutor are noteworthy.  While this Hitchcock film may not be his best work, I confess I liked ""I Confess.""",4,An excellent overlooked Hitchcock film,1364342400,"03 27, 2013",2013,2225,"['underappreciated', 'film', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'escaped', 'now', 'Set', 'mostly', 'filmed', 'Montreal', 'early', 'performance', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'priest', 'ordained', 'only', '2', 'years', 'earlier', 'Hitchcock', 'film', 'nighttime', 'setting', 'giving', 'opportunity', 'film', 'low', 'light', 'complete', 'beautiful', 'architecture', 'mysterious', 'shadows', 'lone', 'man', 'wearing', 'cassock', 'quickly', 'leaving', 'house', 'man', 'saw', 'seconds', 'earlier', 'slumped', 'table.It', 'out', 'be', 'Otto', 'O.', 'E.', 'Hasse', 'German', 'immigrant', 'who', 'church', 'wife', 'Alma', 'rare', 'appearance', 'famed', 'German', 'actress', 'Dolly', 'Haas', 'Michael', 'Clift', 'seeing', 'someone', 'enter', 'church', 'bedroom', 'window', 'hurries', 'down', 'see', 'what', 'what', 'Otto', 'confessing', 'sins', 'process', 'Father', 'Michael', 'had', 'killed', 'man', 'robbery', 'Michael', 'sworn', 'secrecy', 'confession', 'eventually', 'implicated', 'charged', 'tried', 'murder', 'Why', 'Stay', 'me.Many', 'years', 'earlier', 'seen', 'flashback', 'Michael', 'had', 'love', 'affair', 'Ruth', 'Ann', 'Baxter', 'mandatory', 'Hitchcock', 'blonde', 'hair', 'Called', 'war', 'Michael', 'was', 'gone', '2', 'years', 'meantime', 'Ruth', 'married', 'Pierre', 'wealthy', 'politician', 'When', 'Michael', 'return', 'meet', 'get', 'caught', 'driving', 'rainstorm', 'stay', 'night', 'nearby', 'Gazebo', 'where', 'are', 'discovered', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'killed', 'years', 'later', 'was', 'fact', 'blackmailing', 'Ruth', 'hookup', 'are', 'never', 'certain', 'how', 'far', 'liaison', 'progressed', 'romantically', 'Father', 'Michael', 'was', 'going', 'confront', 'man', 'morning', 'death.The', 'movie', 'much', 'going', 'photography', 'excellent', 'thanks', 'Robert', 'Burks', 'Hitchcock', 'vision', 'Baxter', 'performance', 'seemed', 'bit', 'melodramatic', 'times', 'rest', 'cast', 'top', 'game', 'Clift', 'acting', 'style', 'caused', 'controversy', 'time', 'was', 'early', 'proponent', 'method', 'school', 'found', 'terribly', 'sympathetic', 'spot', 'Likewise', 'Karl', 'Malden', 'primary', 'police', 'inspector', 'Brian', 'Aherne', 'Crown', 'prosecutor', 'are', 'noteworthy', 'Hitchcock', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'best', 'work', 'confess', 'liked', 'Confess']",N/A

I'm not sure I have an answer as to why, as it seems 50 years on not to have worn as well as many of Hitch's subsequent 50s films; perhaps it has something to do with the religious aspects of the film, or the French-Canadian location shooting; or Montgomery Clift. At any rate, though the subject matter is certainly quite thought-provoking and there's a psychological character inherent in the character of a priest allowing himself to potentially face death rather than to betray the confidence of a confession, the film on the whole rang just a little hollow for me. The true murderer of the wealthy lawyer who (it will turn out) has been blackmailing the priest's former lover is known right away, and though that alone doesn't necessarily remove the suspense, the character of Otto Keller is a bit too broadly drawn and villainous....there's no doubt that he will do whatever it takes to protect himself, and thus all our focus on the moral issues lies with the priest Father Logan (Montgomery Clift). And Logan just isn't terribly interesting, isn't written in a way that really moved me; he's obstinate when questioned by the over-eager inspector in charge of the case (Karl Malden) but so vague and noncommittal that we aren't even sure (from the text of the film, anyway) that he's actually protecting the murderer out of his own fears, or because of his beliefs.My favorite scene in the film is one that seems to provoke an opposite reaction in many, and that is the flashback where the woman who has been blackmailed by the murdered lawyer, Mm Grandfort (Anne Baxter, quite solid) recalls her past love with the priest. It's atypical Hitchcock, romantic and gauzy, and a lot of people seem to hate it, but for me it was quite magical and really made me feel for these characters in a way that the rest of the film often failed to do.Nice photography and location shots in Quebec City, and I can't complain much about the acting; it was certainly very watchable and contained some reasonably suspenseful moments; **** would be respectable or even tops for most filmmakers, but it's lower-echelon for Hitchcock.

Montgomery Clift stars as Father Michael William Logan, a Catholic priest who listens to a murderer's confession but is unable to relay that confession to police detective, Inspector Larrue (Karl Malden). Torn between the truth and his commitment to the church, Father Logan's suffrage is somewhat alleviated by his former girlfriend, Ruth Grandfort (Ann Baxter). Both the elegance and class with which Hitchcock takes great pains to explore Father Logan's struggle with faith are uncharacteristically compassionate. The film is deeply moving on various levels and culminates in a trial that is quite likely one of the best examples of how to stage court room suspense.Warner's DVD transfer exhibits a balanced gray scale with deep, solid blacks and reasonably clean whites.

Like ""The Wrong Man"" it also contains the most overt reference to Hitchcock's Catholic upbringing.The plot hinges on the sanctity of the Catholic Confessional and whether a priest (played by Montgomery Clift) will break it to save himself.The exteriors of the film were (beautifully) shot in Quebec and this really adds to the look and atmosphere of the film.Clift is superb as the priest - he captures the brooding intensity of the character - and shows the value of the ""method"" acting style that he and others brought to Hollywood in the late 1940s and early 1950s.My one quibble with the morality of Clift's character is that his inaction leads to the unnecessary death of two innocent people. Hitchcock originally wanted the priest to die at the end but Joseph Breen - head of the Production Code Administration (PCA) and a staunch Catholic - would not allow this.""I Confess"" is not top-drawer Hitchcock but still good entertainment particulary for Hitchcock buffs.",4,Will a priest break the Confessional to save himself?,1184371200,"07 14, 2007",2007,1120,"['Confess', 'many', 'similarities', 'Hitchcock', 'Wrong', 'Man', 'theme', 'innocent', 'man', 'caught', 'up', 'machinations', 'justice', 'system', 'Wrong', 'Man', 'also', 'most', 'overt', 'reference', 'Hitchcock', 'Catholic', 'upbringing.The', 'plot', 'hinges', 'sanctity', 'Catholic', 'Confessional', 'priest', 'played', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'will', 'break', 'save', 'himself.The', 'exteriors', 'film', 'were', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'Quebec', 'really', 'look', 'atmosphere', 'film.Clift', 'superb', 'priest', 'brooding', 'intensity', 'character', 'value', 'method', 'acting', 'style', 'others', 'brought', 'Hollywood', 'late', '1940s', 'early', '1950s.My', 'one', 'quibble', 'morality', 'Clift', 'character', 'inaction', 'unnecessary', 'death', 'two', 'innocent', 'people', 'Hitchcock', 'originally', 'wanted', 'priest', 'die', 'end', 'Joseph', 'Breen', 'head', 'Production', 'Code', 'Administration', 'PCA', 'staunch', 'Catholic', 'would', 'not', 'allow', 'Confess', 'not', 'top-drawer', 'Hitchcock', 'still', 'good', 'entertainment', 'particulary', 'Hitchcock', 'buffs']",N/A

110092,A16QODENBJVUI1,0790742403,Robert Moore,"[1, 1]","This is, in my opinion, a somewhat underrated film.  It has two things going against it that has unfairly hurt in, I believe, in the general estimation.  First, because Montgomery Clift plays a Catholic priest, there is no real possibility of a romance (though they manage to work in a backdoor one).  Second, many refuse to believe that a priest, hearing a murder confession in the Office of Confession, would refuse to turn the culprit into the police.  Even though I am a Baptist, I have no trouble understanding the central logic of the Office and I do not understand why so many critics have trouble with this.  Of course, the movie largely turns on the inability of the murderer to believe that the priest would keep silent.The film has a slightly different atmosphere than most Hitchcock films, a somewhat foreign feel.  Certainly setting the film in Quebec (one of the few major films ever shot there) contributes to this.  The locales reveal a city of haunting, historic beauty, feeling more European than North American.Ultimately what keeps this from coming up to the level of Hitchcock's best films is a somewhat stilted, unrealistic style.  Too much of the acting and framing of characters is unnecessarily mannered.  There is also the lack of ironical joy and humor that runs through all of Hitchcock's best films.  The tone of this one is too serious by far.  It is one of the very few Hitchcock films completely lacking in humor.Still, this is a frequently interesting film with many interesting moments.  They unfortunately the various elements do not add up to one of his better films.Hitchcock makes his obligatory appearance in the film in virtually the first shot, walking along the top of a set of stairs, framed in shadow.  At this stage in his directing career his appearances were both a blessing and a curse.  He knew that the audience expected to see him, but he also found it a bit of a bother.  So increasingly he was determined to get it out of the way as soon as possible.  In NORTH BY NORTHWEST he similarly gets his appearance out of the way almost before the end of the opening credits.",4,One of Hitchcock's more unusual films,1266105600,"02 14, 2010",2010,2120,"['opinion', 'somewhat', 'underrated', 'film', 'two', 'things', 'going', 'unfairly', 'hurt', 'believe', 'general', 'estimation', 'First', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'Catholic', 'priest', 'real', 'possibility', 'romance', 'manage', 'work', 'backdoor', 'one', 'Second', 'many', 'refuse', 'believe', 'priest', 'hearing', 'murder', 'confession', 'Office', 'Confession', 'would', 'refuse', 'turn', 'culprit', 'police', 'Even', 'am', 'Baptist', 'have', 'trouble', 'understanding', 'central', 'logic', 'Office', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'critics', 'have', 'trouble', 'course', 'movie', 'largely', 'inability', 'murderer', 'believe', 'priest', 'would', 'keep', 'silent.The', 'film', 'slightly', 'different', 'atmosphere', 'most', 'Hitchcock', 'films', 'somewhat', 'foreign', 'feel', 'Certainly', 'setting', 'film', 'Quebec', 'one', 'few', 'major', 'films', 'ever', 'shot', 'there', 'locales', 'reveal', 'city', 'haunting', 'historic', 'beauty', 'feeling', 'more', 'European', 'North', 'American.Ultimately', 'what', 'coming', 'up', 'level', 'Hitchcock', 'best', 'films', 'somewhat', 'stilted', 'unrealistic', 'style', 'Too', 'much', 'acting', 'framing', 'characters', 'unnecessarily', 'mannered', 'also', 'lack', 'ironical', 'joy', 'humor', 'Hitchcock', 'best', 'films', 'tone', 'one', 'too', 'serious', 'far', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'Hitchcock', 'films', 'completely', 'lacking', 'humor.Still', 'frequently', 'interesting', 'film', 'many', 'interesting', 'moments', 'unfortunately', 'various', 'elements', 'do', 'not', 'add', 'up', 'one', 'better', 'films.Hitchcock', 'obligatory', 'appearance', 'film', 'virtually', 'first', 'shot', 'walking', 'top', 'set', 'stairs', 'framed', 'shadow', 'stage', 'directing', 'career', 'appearances', 'were', 'blessing', 'curse', 'knew', 'audience', 'expected', 'see', 'also', 'found', 'bit', 'bother', 'So', 'increasingly', 'was', 'determined', 'get', 'way', 'as', 'soon', 'possible', 'NORTH', 'BY', 'NORTHWEST', 'similarly', 'appearance', 'way', 'almost', 'end', 'opening', 'credits']",N/A

Hasse), murders a lawyer named Vilette (Ovila Legare) when he is caught stealing... Keller thereupon confesses his crime to Father Michael Logan (Montgomery Clift), a priest at the Quebec church where he is a sexton...Vilette was blackmailing Ruth Grandfort (Anne Baxter), who was in love with Logan before he was ordained and who continues to love him in spite of his religious vows and her subsequent marriage to Pierre Granfort (Roger Dann).Keller wore a cassock when he committed the crime and Father Logan is unable to supply an alibi for the time of the murder - a series of coincidences which eventually find the priest on trial for murder...The dilemma of ""I Confess"" relates to Catholic church law which specifically forbids the clergy from disclosing those sins exposed in the privacy of the confessional... Thus forced into complicity with the murderer, Father Logan behaves as though he is guilty despite his innocence in much the same way Guy Haines takes on some of Bruno's guilt in Hitchcock's ""Strangers on a Train."" The film's tension derives from the audience's knowledge of the cleric's ethical problem and its desire to see him break his vows to save his own life...Montgomery Clift makes the clergyman's inner torment apparent simply by the anguished expression in his eyes, and creates sympathy for a man who could be an object of mockery by maintaining his dignity...Compassionate, grave, and restrained, Clift delineates the priest's conflicting emotions with the distinguished nuances of expression... His face, vulnerable but brighter by discerning yet kind eyes, reveals his suffering with eloquent intensity...While a determined Karl Malden looks for every scrap of information to clear the murder, an embarrassing crown prosecutor (Brian Aherne) is in despair to establish a motive for the murder...With moody atmosphere, set against the background of picturesque Quebec photographed in black and white, ""I Confess"" is solemn and entertaining, never getting out of control, with an overpowering sense of doom and enough amount of suspense in the manhunt of a killer...",4,"The seal of confession is highly illustrated by Hitchcock's ""I Confess""",1167609600,"01 1, 2007",2007,2268,"['transfer', 'culpability', 'was', 'basic', 'theme', 'Hitchcock', 'Strangers', 'Train', 'furnished', 'provocative', 'dilemma', 'Confess', 'German', 'refugee', 'Keller', 'O.E', 'Hasse', 'lawyer', 'named', 'Vilette', 'Ovila', 'Legare', 'when', 'caught', 'stealing', 'Keller', 'thereupon', 'crime', 'Father', 'Michael', 'Logan', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'priest', 'Quebec', 'church', 'where', 'sexton', 'Vilette', 'was', 'blackmailing', 'Ruth', 'Grandfort', 'Anne', 'Baxter', 'who', 'was', 'love', 'Logan', 'was', 'ordained', 'who', 'love', 'spite', 'religious', 'vows', 'subsequent', 'marriage', 'Pierre', 'Granfort', 'Roger', 'Dann', 'cassock', 'when', 'committed', 'crime', 'Father', 'Logan', 'unable', 'supply', 'alibi', 'time', 'murder', 'series', 'coincidences', 'eventually', 'find', 'priest', 'trial', 'murder', 'dilemma', 'Confess', 'Catholic', 'church', 'law', 'specifically', 'clergy', 'disclosing', 'sins', 'exposed', 'privacy', 'confessional', 'Thus', 'forced', 'complicity', 'murderer', 'Father', 'Logan', 'guilty', 'innocence', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'Guy', 'Haines', 'Bruno', 'guilt', 'Hitchcock', 'Strangers', 'Train', 'film', 'tension', 'audience', 'knowledge', 'cleric', 'ethical', 'problem', 'desire', 'see', 'break', 'vows', 'save', 'own', 'life', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'clergyman', 'inner', 'torment', 'apparent', 'simply', 'anguished', 'expression', 'eyes', 'sympathy', 'man', 'who', 'could', 'be', 'object', 'mockery', 'maintaining', 'dignity', 'Compassionate', 'grave', 'restrained', 'Clift', 'priest', 'conflicting', 'emotions', 'distinguished', 'nuances', 'expression', 'face', 'vulnerable', 'brighter', 'discerning', 'yet', 'kind', 'eyes', 'suffering', 'eloquent', 'intensity', 'determined', 'Karl', 'Malden', 'scrap', 'information', 'clear', 'murder', 'embarrassing', 'crown', 'prosecutor', 'Brian', 'Aherne', 'despair', 'establish', 'motive', 'murder', 'moody', 'atmosphere', 'set', 'background', 'picturesque', 'Quebec', 'photographed', 'black', 'white', 'Confess', 'solemn', 'entertaining', 'never', 'getting', 'control', 'overpowering', 'sense', 'doom', 'enough', 'amount', 'suspense', 'manhunt', 'killer']",N/A

It had the falsely accused theme that we've seen in other Hitch films, but it was a bit overly melodramatic, a trial with a woman accused of an affair with the priest, and the priest himself who would not reveal that the killer confessed to a murder in the sanctity of the confessional, regardless of the killer's actions.The film starts with Keller (the killer, get it?) leaving the scene of the crime, as the audience follows the signs (""Direction""!) to a window where we see a dead body splayed on the floor!Karl Malden (later to become the tough cop on the TV series Streets of San Francisco some twenty years later) gathers the facts and find that the priest, played innocently by Montgomery Clift, could be a part of the murder that occurred.We learn that Keller is actually the groundskeeper at the very rectory where the priest Logan resides.  While the priest is trying to prove his innocence, the killer goes more and more crazy, considers that the priest will betray him to the police.Keller's wife meantime has the guilt eat her until she's about to burst.  Does she protect her husband or protect the priest?And throughout the film Logan is trying to steer any implication that Keller is guilty and confessed in a confessional away from the police radar -- even to the point of being tried for the crime!  And even though Keller's version of the story to the jury (complete, baldfaced lying!) does not jibe with Logan's.This film is pretty dark in that it confronts the actions of a Catholic priest, his protection of the sanctity of the confessional and what he does to protect that high office.Hitchcock's imagery is powerful!  The priest, torn and depressed, walks the streets of Quebec as we see a silhouette the Roman soldier statues with Christ burdened with his cross.In this film too is Anne Baxter as the love interest, who does not love her husband but still loves Logan, who himself keeps her at arm's length.  Baxter is quite the over the top actress who ramps up the tears and frankly overacts the part.Montgomery Clift is perfect as the accused priest who will stop at nothing to protect his parishioner, even as that parishioner frames his own priest for murder!",5,"Protecting The Priesthood, At What Cost?

Montgomery Clift plays Father Michael Logan. Father Logan has a murderer confess his deed to him. When Logan becomes a suspect, he's unable to divulge what was said. When a detective (a superb Karl Malden) begins investigating the murder, he comes to believe that Father Logan is the suspect he's looking for. Complicating things, is a woman that Logan had an affair with years before and her involvement with the victim.One of Hitch's most stylish and the most noir looking thriller of his career, ""I Confess"" is one of Hitch's few films to be shot on location in the latter part of his career. Shot in beautiful Quebec, there's a distinct European flavor to the film due to the city's distinct architecture and cobblestone streets. Clift gives a soulful performance despite the fact that he and Hitch clashed on the set and having a script compromised by Breen's editing of the script for offensive material.Although the film doesn't quite live up to the standards of ""Strangers on a Train"" (the film that preceded it) or ""Rear Window"" (the film after it), it's a very good minor classic in Hitchcock's body of work. The transfer looks unusually sharp for the most part and although there is noticeable grain issues here, it's to be expected given the black and white photography, age of the film and type of film stock used to shoot the film. Wonderful cinematography from Hitchcock's reliable Robert Burks.The special features include a short documentary (about 20 minutes) on the making of the film featuring Peter Bogdanovich, Patricia Hitchcock O'Connell and Jack Larson (Jimmy Olsen to those who grew up on ""Superman"" on TV). There's also a discussion of the performances and the difficulties in shooting the film with Clift. We also get a vintage newsreel that discusses the premiere of the film in Canada and the original theatrical trailer.",4,Pleasing Hitchcock film gets its due on DVD,1094774400,"09 10, 2004",2004,1980,"['confess', 'have', 'soft', 'spot', 'Hitchcock', 'examination', 'conflict', 'vows', 'priest', 'vows', 'justice', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'Father', 'Michael', 'Logan', 'Father', 'Logan', 'murderer', 'confess', 'deed', 'When', 'Logan', 'suspect', 'unable', 'divulge', 'what', 'was', 'said', 'When', 'detective', 'superb', 'Karl', 'Malden', 'investigating', 'murder', 'believe', 'Father', 'Logan', 'suspect', 'looking', 'Complicating', 'things', 'woman', 'Logan', 'had', 'affair', 'years', 'involvement', 'victim.One', 'Hitch', 'most', 'stylish', 'most', 'noir', 'looking', 'thriller', 'career', 'Confess', 'one', 'Hitch', 'few', 'films', 'be', 'shot', 'location', 'latter', 'part', 'career', 'Shot', 'beautiful', 'Quebec', 'distinct', 'European', 'flavor', 'film', 'due', 'city', 'distinct', 'architecture', 'cobblestone', 'streets', 'Clift', 'soulful', 'performance', 'fact', 'Hitch', 'clashed', 'set', 'having', 'script', 'compromised', 'Breen', 'editing', 'script', 'offensive', 'film', ""n't"", 'quite', 'live', 'up', 'standards', 'Strangers', 'Train', 'film', 'preceded', 'Rear', 'Window', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'minor', 'classic', 'Hitchcock', 'body', 'work', 'transfer', 'unusually', 'sharp', 'most', 'part', 'noticeable', 'grain', 'issues', 'here', 'be', 'expected', 'given', 'black', 'white', 'photography', 'age', 'film', 'type', 'film', 'stock', 'used', 'shoot', 'film', 'Wonderful', 'cinematography', 'Hitchcock', 'reliable', 'Robert', 'Burks.The', 'special', 'features', 'include', 'short', 'documentary', '20', 'minutes', 'making', 'film', 'featuring', 'Peter', 'Bogdanovich', 'Patricia', 'Hitchcock', ""O'Connell"", 'Jack', 'Larson', 'Jimmy', 'Olsen', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'Superman', 'TV', 'also', 'discussion', 'performances', 'difficulties', 'shooting', 'film', 'Clift', 'also', 'get', 'vintage', 'newsreel', 'premiere', 'film', 'Canada', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer']",N/A
110102,A3GUNXVYK34085,0790742403,William F. Flanigan Jr.,"[2, 2]","A standard Hitchcock plot device: the wrong man.  Dark, sinister, foreboding, and claustrophobic with exteriors shot in Quebec.  (Hitchcock lamely claimed he chose Quebec because the clergy still wore cassocks.)Essentially a one-actor film.  Without Montgomery Clift (the priest), the movie may not have been possible.  Most of the supporting players are outstanding especially Carl Malden (the totally focused Inspector Larrue) and most especially O.E. Hasse (the ungrateful killer) who was a star on German stage and screen  before WW II.  Anne Baxter (Montgomery's pre-priest squeeze and not Hitchcock's first choice), however, delivers a so-so performance (she was not an especially happy camper during production).  Many script variations were considered, but abandoned in face of the censorship still prevalent at the time (early 1950's) including a Clift/Baxter love child and the execution of the priest for murder.A must for Hitchcock enthusiasts.WILLIAM FLANIGAN, Ph.D.",3,Cassocks Aren't For Everyone,1264291200,"01 24, 2010",2010,979,"['standard', 'Hitchcock', 'plot', 'device', 'wrong', 'man', 'Dark', 'sinister', 'foreboding', 'claustrophobic', 'exteriors', 'shot', 'Quebec', 'Hitchcock', 'lamely', 'claimed', 'chose', 'Quebec', 'clergy', 'still', 'wore', 'cassocks', 'Essentially', 'one-actor', 'film', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'priest', 'movie', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'possible', 'Most', 'supporting', 'players', 'are', 'outstanding', 'especially', 'Carl', 'Malden', 'totally', 'focused', 'Inspector', 'Larrue', 'most', 'especially', 'O.E', 'Hasse', 'ungrateful', 'killer', 'who', 'was', 'star', 'German', 'stage', 'screen', 'WW', 'II', 'Anne', 'Baxter', 'Montgomery', 'pre-priest', 'squeeze', 'not', 'Hitchcock', 'first', 'choice', 'however', 'so-so', 'performance', 'was', 'not', 'especially', 'happy', 'camper', 'production', 'Many', 'script', 'variations', 'were', 'considered', 'abandoned', 'face', 'censorship', 'still', 'prevalent', 'time', 'early', '1950', 'including', 'Clift/Baxter', 'love', 'child', 'execution', 'priest', 'murder.A', 'must', 'Hitchcock', 'enthusiasts.WILLIAM', 'FLANIGAN', 'Ph.D']",N/A
110103,AP3B615GM191G,0790742403,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[1, 1]","Much like ""The Wrong Man"", another Alfred Hitchcock gem, ""I Confess"" is a classic ""what if?"" scenario, this time involving a Catholic priest and a confession that completely changes his life.For a basic plot summary, ""I Confess"" sees Father Michael Logan (Montgomery Clift) hear the confession of murderer Otto Keller (O.E. Hasse).  Sworn to secrecy by the tradition of the confessional, however, Father Logan must grapple with his devotion to the cloth when outing Otto would mean saving himself and the woman he loves.This is a simple little film (nothing grandeur or over-the-top about it), but at the same time it works very well on a number of different levels.  The acting is superb (also including Anne Baxter in a key role), the plot is classic Hitchcock character-driven suspense, and the narrative keeps progressing forward in such a way that it continues to build upon itself.  In other words, the pressure only continues to mount on Logan as each new development in the murder case comes to light.Overall, ""I Confess"" is a solid Hitch effort that, while maybe not in ""Top Ten"" status for the famous director, is most certainly worth a viewing for the emotional characters and progressive drama.",4,Another Great Character Study From The Master,1351728000,"11 1, 2012",2012,1206,"['Much', 'Wrong', 'Man', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'gem', 'Confess', 'classic', 'what', 'scenario', 'time', 'involving', 'Catholic', 'priest', 'confession', 'completely', 'life.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'Confess', 'Father', 'Michael', 'Logan', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'hear', 'confession', 'murderer', 'Otto', 'Keller', 'O.E', 'Hasse', 'Sworn', 'secrecy', 'tradition', 'confessional', 'however', 'Father', 'Logan', 'must', 'grapple', 'devotion', 'cloth', 'when', 'outing', 'Otto', 'would', 'mean', 'saving', 'woman', 'simple', 'little', 'film', 'nothing', 'grandeur', 'over-the-top', 'same', 'time', 'very', 'well', 'number', 'different', 'levels', 'acting', 'superb', 'also', 'including', 'Anne', 'Baxter', 'key', 'role', 'plot', 'classic', 'Hitchcock', 'character-driven', 'suspense', 'narrative', 'keeps', 'progressing', 'forward', 'such', 'way', 'build', 'other', 'words', 'pressure', 'only', 'mount', 'Logan', 'new', 'development', 'murder', 'case', 'light.Overall', 'Confess', 'solid', 'Hitch', 'effort', 'maybe', 'not', 'Top', 'Ten', 'status', 'famous', 'director', 'most', 'certainly', 'viewing', 'emotional', 'characters', 'progressive', 'drama']",N/A
