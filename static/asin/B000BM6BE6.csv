944769,AIPSUF99BQ17T,B000BM6BE6,Amazon.com-lover,"[6, 6]","Every aspect of this DVD! If you are a huge Todd fan ( me! me!) or just curious, this DVD went beyond my expectations. The musicianship is incredible, and Kasim Sultan is one of the most best kept secrets in the music world- what a completely perfect bassist he is! The unique staging and lighting... and of course, with out a doubt, Mr. R's blissfully auricle-pleasing voice, a voice that has improved ( and his voice was great before!) with time, he has a command and power that can bring the listener to his/her knees. WHY this man isn't holding top honors at what ever celebrity driven music awards show is a huge sign that our society knows nothing about artistry...Todd is gifted to his marrow and this DVD shows it. I really enjoyed the little extras , the scene at the Japanese restaurant and the Japanese fan club party were so delightful!  Todd and the band members singing and playing music with the wonderful Japanese band (  I loved the female bassist who wore her beautiful kimono) ... I felt like I was at the party!There are scores of Todd and Utopia CDs/DVDS but this was tops with audio and video quality. Extremely recommended ( and don't forget the  Liars CD... it  is sublime! Get that too! )",5,5 stars for:,1138665600,"01 31, 2006",2006,1213,"['aspect', 'DVD', 'are', 'huge', 'Todd', 'fan', 'just', 'curious', 'DVD', 'went', 'expectations', 'musicianship', 'incredible', 'Kasim', 'Sultan', 'one', 'most', 'best', 'kept', 'secrets', 'music', 'world-', 'what', 'completely', 'perfect', 'bassist', 'unique', 'staging', 'lighting', 'course', 'out', 'doubt', 'Mr.', 'R', 'blissfully', 'auricle-pleasing', 'voice', 'voice', 'improved', 'voice', 'was', 'great', 'time', 'command', 'power', 'can', 'bring', 'listener', 'his/her', 'knees', 'WHY', 'man', ""n't"", 'holding', 'top', 'honors', 'what', 'ever', 'celebrity', 'driven', 'music', 'awards', 'show', 'huge', 'sign', 'society', 'nothing', 'artistry', 'Todd', 'gifted', 'marrow', 'DVD', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'little', 'extras', 'scene', 'Japanese', 'restaurant', 'Japanese', 'fan', 'club', 'party', 'were', 'so', 'delightful', 'Todd', 'band', 'members', 'singing', 'playing', 'music', 'wonderful', 'Japanese', 'band', 'loved', 'female', 'bassist', 'who', 'wore', 'beautiful', 'kimono', 'felt', 'was', 'party', 'are', 'scores', 'Todd', 'Utopia', 'CDs/DVDS', 'was', 'tops', 'audio', 'video', 'quality', 'Extremely', 'recommended', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'Liars', 'CD', 'sublime', 'Get', 'too']",N/A

944772,ADWH2E3TYI0Q1,B000BM6BE6,"cordell jeffries ""Cordell Jeffries""","[7, 7]","Loyal fans like me -- and probably all of the other reviewers of this DVD -- always go to Todd shows. Always.Still, for years now, it has seemed Todd has been calling it in from a touring perspective. More or less the same material, increasingly sloppy performances, but usually a quality night out with an old musical friend, so to speak.This tour -- and this DVD -- reverses that trend. In a big way.As some have already pointed out, the production on this is impeccable. Next, he had some amazing material to promote for a change...Liars was a real comeback for TR, winding up on many critics' best-of-2004 lists.Reason #3 has to be that amazing band he had backing him up -- unbelievable all the way around. Prairie Prince was on fire. Kasim Sulton's bass/background vocals were exactly what you'd expect from someone who goes back three decades with Todd.But enough about how this sounds. This show looks almost as good. The shooting, editing, art direction, stage and wardrobe combine to make this thing a retinal treat...a concert DVD that's infinitely more watchable than most concert shows.In short, Todd truly was ""on"" this particular night. Actually, this entire tour.As a result, this DVD clearly demonstrates that Neil Young and The Boss aren't the only old rockers who remain musically relevant.While most of Bruce & Neil & Todd's peers either continue do reunion/greatest hits shows, switch over to Motown/Jazz Standards to make a fast buck or sell their songs to advertising agencies, Todd has made an album -- and now a live DVD -- that holds its own with Radiohead and, yes, U2. Very high praise, I realize.But in 2004/2005, Mr. Rundgren rediscovered his A-game.Hopefully, he can keep playing at that level. (However, just hearing that he has decided to replace Ric Ocasek in The Cars on their reunion tour makes me think he's already returning to more familiar musical territory.)",5,Essential For Any Music Fan.,1134172800,"12 10, 2005",2005,1899,"['Loyal', 'fans', 'probably', 'other', 'reviewers', 'DVD', 'always', 'go', 'Todd', 'shows', 'Always.Still', 'years', 'now', 'seemed', 'Todd', 'been', 'calling', 'touring', 'perspective', 'More', 'less', 'same', 'material', 'increasingly', 'sloppy', 'performances', 'usually', 'quality', 'night', 'out', 'old', 'musical', 'friend', 'so', 'speak.This', 'tour', 'DVD', 'trend', 'big', 'way.As', 'have', 'already', 'pointed', 'out', 'production', 'impeccable', 'Next', 'had', 'amazing', 'material', 'promote', 'change', 'Liars', 'was', 'real', 'comeback', 'TR', 'winding', 'up', 'many', 'critics', 'best-of-2004', 'lists.Reason', '3', 'be', 'amazing', 'band', 'had', 'backing', 'up', 'unbelievable', 'way', 'Prairie', 'Prince', 'was', 'fire', 'Kasim', 'Sulton', 'bass/background', 'vocals', 'were', 'exactly', 'what', ""'d"", 'expect', 'someone', 'who', 'back', 'three', 'decades', 'Todd.But', 'enough', 'how', 'show', 'almost', 'good', 'shooting', 'editing', 'art', 'direction', 'stage', 'wardrobe', 'combine', 'make', 'thing', 'retinal', 'treat', 'concert', 'DVD', 'infinitely', 'more', 'watchable', 'most', 'concert', 'shows.In', 'short', 'Todd', 'truly', 'was', 'particular', 'night', 'Actually', 'entire', 'tour.As', 'result', 'DVD', 'clearly', 'Neil', 'Young', 'Boss', 'are', ""n't"", 'only', 'old', 'rockers', 'who', 'remain', 'musically', 'relevant.While', 'most', 'Bruce', 'Neil', 'Todd', 'peers', 'continue', 'do', 'reunion/greatest', 'hits', 'shows', 'switch', 'Motown/Jazz', 'Standards', 'make', 'fast', 'buck', 'sell', 'songs', 'advertising', 'agencies', 'Todd', 'made', 'album', 'now', 'live', 'DVD', 'own', 'Radiohead', 'yes', 'U2', 'Very', 'high', 'praise', 'realize.But', '2004/2005', 'Mr.', 'Rundgren', 'rediscovered', 'A-game.Hopefully', 'can', 'keep', 'playing', 'level', 'However', 'just', 'hearing', 'decided', 'replace', 'Ric', 'Ocasek', 'Cars', 'reunion', 'tour', 'think', 'already', 'returning', 'more', 'familiar', 'musical', 'territory']",N/A

One of the most precise, powerful, and stylish drummers of our time, Prince was one of the best parts of the Tubes (which is where, you may know, he hooked up with Rundgren).  It's nothing short of a joy to watch him hammer out brilliant fills during this version of the Tubes/Rundgren collaboration ""Feel It.""  That plus Prairie in the Pope outfit alone makes the disc for me - but the rest of the band is in excellent form.  The age-old Rundgren ego shows its fairly aging stuff here, but he still makes innovative and quality stuff.

944775,A1P2NBM3P3TS2X,B000BM6BE6,"John S. Harris ""The Voice of Reason""","[5, 5]","I saw this tour about a week before this particular performance was filmed.  It was only my third Todd show but it was easily the best.  I'd heard Kasim Sulton on Todd's records and seen him on Todd's other DVDs, but it was an absolute treat to hear him play live.  And Prairie Prince?  I've been a big fan of his since the Seventies, so I'm biased.Visually, this DVD is a bit of a compromise.  The colors and lighting are so thick and saturated that it doesn't translate well to film.  In person, however, it was arresting.  But there's more to a concert DVD than lighting  ---  there's energy, musicianship, and the performance itself.  And that's where this concert DVD hits all the right notes.""Liars"" is perhaps Todd's strongest record since ""Second Wind"" in 1991 (a personal favorite).  Unbelievably good fortune for us that Todd chose to capture this tour on film for us.  This is a great companion piece to a great record.  Todd's tour for ""The Individualist"" was interesting for the fact that the songs from that album sounded great live but weren't so interesting on the studio CD.  Some argue the same thing for the ""No World Order"" tour and CD.  But this ""Liars"" tour and CD make up for all of that, no question.Can't believe the record store in my little dink, un-hip town had SEVEN copies of this DVD in stock yesterday!  At least the store manager has taste, even if the majority of record buyers don't.  I bought two copies of this DVD  -- one for me and one for some future deserving soul.",5,No lying!

Not only that, he covers the topic of truth and lies in our society and within ourselves and our relationships from top to bottom. His lyrics (and music) are pure genius. Too bad most people don't even care about quality music of this type. To me it is as vital as eating or breathing. Great show. A Funny blues version of ""Born To Synthesize"" was a nice surprise (kind of ironic in and of itself) to lighten things up. When I saw Todd do this show at Ruth Eckerd Hall in Clearwater Florida May 2004 I was finally back in Utopia with my old buddy. Now I can relive the same tour over again with this DVD. Thanks Todd!

Very futuristic looking and sounding.  The concert takes placed in an intimate setting at The Egg in Albany, New York.  I would prefer a smaller venue than a huge arena concert anyway.  This DVD is EXCELLENT.  I LOVE all the songs included in this performance.  The costumes AND stage setup are wild and excellently conceived (especially the glasses that Todd wears on the first song, ""Truth"").  The musicianship is superb, and TODD is a genious when it comes to songwriting, his musicianship, and music production.  I understand he now resides in Hawaii and composes all his material in his home studio.  Wish I were in that ""predicament"", lol!
