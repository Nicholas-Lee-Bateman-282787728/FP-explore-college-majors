It is about a guy who is always late to work, so he lets a homeless guy ride with him so he can use the carpool lane on the highway to speed things up a bit. The bum turns out not to be who he seems to be. The main character is an advertising executive, and the bum has a few tricks up his sleeve. See it for the daytime stars, the story, and the DVD extras.",4,:-),1359936000,"02 4, 2013",2013,444,"['Well', 'made', 'movie', 'learning', 'life', 'movie', 'bunch', 'soap', 'stars', 'guy', 'who', 'always', 'late', 'work', 'homeless', 'guy', 'ride', 'so', 'can', 'use', 'carpool', 'lane', 'highway', 'speed', 'things', 'up', 'bit', 'bum', 'out', 'not', 'be', 'who', 'be', 'main', 'character', 'advertising', 'executive', 'bum', 'few', 'tricks', 'up', 'sleeve', 'See', 'daytime', 'stars', 'story', 'DVD', 'extras']",Carpool Guy

The whole movie is a great idea but just goes downhill. Sometimes the voices are out of sync with the lips which can be quite a distraction. Anthony Geary as the &#34;Carpool Guy&#34; wins my heart!,4,Great idea,1371340800,"06 16, 2013",2013,319,"['steam', 'way', 'really', 'do', 'love', 'see', 'Jeanne', 'Cooper', 'even', 'scream', 'best', 'whole', 'movie', 'great', 'idea', 'just', 'downhill', 'Sometimes', 'voices', 'are', 'sync', 'lips', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'distraction', 'Anthony', 'Geary', '34', 'Carpool', 'Guy', '34', 'wins', 'heart']",Carpool Guy
