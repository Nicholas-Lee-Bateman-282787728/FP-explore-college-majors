1434522,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B004ZDY400,C. B Collins Jr.,"[1, 1]","This is an excellent film and Emily Watson is outstanding in the lead role. Emily plays the part of a social worker who begins to uncover the systematic transfer of poor and often neglected children into virtual enslavement in the British Commonwealth, primarily Australia. This heroic social worker began to unravel a terrible injustice whereby poor children, often taken into protective custody and social services, were then shipped out of the country, often to situations where they became slave labor and were physically and sometimes sexually abused. The acting throughout the film is outstanding since many of the men who were victims as children had repressed memory and suppressed anger. She works to re-unite families where children were taken away from poor families, primarily single poor mothers. Years later she reunites daughters and mothers, sons and mothers, and siblings that were separated by the authorities. The film is a frightening reminder of how thin the line of ethics and morality can be in the handling of those with little power. What could be wrong with working poor boy children as common laborers in a Roman Catholic monastery? In fact, much violence, physical and mental, was inflicted on these children and thus the social worker must heal at several levels. It is a film about heroic behavior, the kind of heroics where a basically good person rises above threats and red-tape to seek healing solutions for others. I would recommend this film to anyone but I especially think that young social work students in colleges should see the film to see the field of social work at its finest hour.",5,Social work at one of its finest hours,1331942400,"03 17, 2012",2012,1626,"['excellent', 'film', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'outstanding', 'lead', 'role', 'Emily', 'part', 'social', 'worker', 'who', 'uncover', 'systematic', 'transfer', 'poor', 'often', 'neglected', 'children', 'virtual', 'enslavement', 'British', 'Commonwealth', 'primarily', 'Australia', 'heroic', 'social', 'worker', 'began', 'unravel', 'terrible', 'injustice', 'whereby', 'poor', 'children', 'often', 'taken', 'protective', 'custody', 'social', 'services', 'were', 'then', 'shipped', 'country', 'often', 'situations', 'where', 'became', 'slave', 'labor', 'were', 'physically', 'sometimes', 'sexually', 'abused', 'acting', 'film', 'outstanding', 'many', 'men', 'who', 'were', 'victims', 'children', 'had', 'repressed', 'memory', 'suppressed', 'anger', 're-unite', 'families', 'where', 'children', 'were', 'taken', 'away', 'poor', 'families', 'primarily', 'single', 'poor', 'mothers', 'Years', 'later', 'daughters', 'mothers', 'sons', 'mothers', 'siblings', 'were', 'separated', 'authorities', 'film', 'frightening', 'reminder', 'how', 'thin', 'line', 'ethics', 'morality', 'can', 'be', 'handling', 'little', 'power', 'What', 'could', 'be', 'wrong', 'working', 'poor', 'boy', 'children', 'common', 'laborers', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'monastery', 'fact', 'much', 'violence', 'physical', 'mental', 'was', 'inflicted', 'children', 'thus', 'social', 'worker', 'must', 'heal', 'several', 'levels', 'film', 'heroic', 'behavior', 'kind', 'heroics', 'where', 'basically', 'good', 'person', 'rises', 'threats', 'red-tape', 'seek', 'healing', 'solutions', 'others', 'would', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'especially', 'think', 'young', 'social', 'work', 'students', 'colleges', 'should', 'see', 'film', 'see', 'field', 'social', 'work', 'finest', 'hour']",Oranges and Sunshine

Rona Munro and Margaret Humphreys, 2010, 84 minutes, first released in Ireland, April, 2011) is the shocking true story (set in the 1980s) of an illegal black market child ""adoption"" program instigated by the British government.Beginning around the 1930s and ending only sometime in the 1970s, troubled mothers around Britain were having their children taken from them by government agents. The children were then told their parents were dead, were neatly shipped off to an orphanage in Australia run by the Christian Brothers, and most often simply stayed in the orphanage.Of course, this being a British film, the rape of the boys is a bit glossed-over for my taste. Not that I have a taste for such things; I have a taste for justice. And the emphasis does seem to be on orphaned boys - I did not notice more than a handful of women who had been victimized by all this. But then I know only what this film reveals.Social worker Margaret Humphreys (the ever-annoying Emily Watson, whose name I am always conflating with Emily Mortimer) is approached by an Australian woman who swears her mother was from England. She explains her story to Humphreys, who blows her off in a tired haze. When Humphreys begins to hear of identical cases around England, she embarks on a painful journey of horrific discoveries. I have already explained them to you in my opening paragraph.Particularly moving is Hugo Weaving as Jack, who has managed to find his real sister but ultimately arrives at the truth too late to meet his mother. In this story you will see Humphreys zipping to-and-fro between England and Australia, with a stunning climactic scene at the rambling orphanage, still in operation under the Christian brothers. I was utterly riveted by another of the orphan adults, Len (my favorite fit-him-in-anywhere David Wenham), a seething, sarcastic man who only wanted someone to tell him the truth about why he was ""orphaned"" - which of course he wasn't.This is a tale too terrifying for you to miss seeing this at least twice. I look forward to at least one more thorough viewing so I can catch details that evaporated from me the first time. This is a true story, based on the bookOranges & Sunshine(a/k/a EMPTY CRADLES) by the real Margaret Humphreys. This is a story I want to study further - and I suggest you do the same.What I'd like to know is what I always whine about: How come we get these gems so very late in the U.S.? Why did I have to wait 2 years to even hear about this film, and what's more, why was it released nearly a year late?

She does not play a &#34;super-woman&#34; but plainly shows what true grit & a determination to find some justice can achieve. The movie is like Emily -- sturdy on top with layers of fire below.

1434528,A328S9RN3U5M68,B004ZDY400,Grady Harp,"[2, 2]","It is always a jolt when a bit of buried history surfaces and makes us realize that the world is not all that sane as we would like to believe:  the Chaos Factor raises its ugly head as in this screen adaptation by Rona Munro of Margaret Humphreys' true story book `Empty Cradles'. This is a very powerful film, all the more so because of the quality of acting and direction by Jim Loach who never lets the film run out of control despite the unveiling tragedy.The story is set in the 1980s where Nottingham, social worker Margaret Humphreys (Emily Watson) is a social worker who encounters a middle aged woman who has traveled from Australia to find her birth parents.  Margaret at first doesn't want to increase her workload with a wild tale of children having been deported form England by ship to be placed in orphanage work camps in Australia, but with the aid of her supportive husband Merv (Richard Dillane) she begins to investigate the uncovered secret, ultimately traveling to Australia where she meets the `unwanted children' as adults each longing to return to the UK to meet their families. The children when deported were as young as four to thirteen years old and had been told their parents either were dead or didn't want them and the representatives from the government promised them a safe home with `oranges and sunshine' in Australia. There are several `victims' as played by Hugo Weaving, David Wenham, Russell Dykstra and others who help personalize the unspoken crime until Margaret progresses to the point where she can hold the British government accountable for child migration schemes and reunite the children involved -- now adults living mostly in Australia -- with their parents in Britain. Though the deportations occurred from the 1940's through the 1970's  it was only after Margaret Humphrey's 1994 book and then much later after when February 2010 Great Britain's Prime Minister Gordon Brown finally issued a full apology to those deported children and their families.The supporting cast is uniformly excellent but it is the glowing performance by Emily Watson that makes this revelation of a film remain in the mind long after the credits explain how the solution played out in reality.  This is a tough film but an important one and deserves a much larger audience than it has found.  Grady Harp, November 12",5,`Thousands of lost children. A secret buried by time.

They were then assigned to a Catholic agency which would eventually send them to Australia to serve as child labourers under some of the most apalling circumstances. The film picks up the story later when many of the children have become adults and had returned to Britain to look for their parents and get answers as to why they were forced to suffer such cruelty. While there are many examples in modern history where children were sent to other lands as orphans - the Barnardo children come to mind - nothing even remotely equals the disgust and criminality associated with this conspiracy to help the state get rid of 'unwanted' children while lining the pockets of the Catholic church. It took the efforts of one very courageous social worker in the nineteen eighties to blow the lid of this very deep dark scheme that destroyed the childhood of many. This film speaks eloquently to the need to let wrongdoing go unchecked, even it means putting one's life in jeopardy. I am reminded once again of the hypocritical lengths public and religions institutions will go to cover up wrong-doing in the interests of what they believe is a higher cause.

1434535,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B004ZDY400,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","The subject matter of ""Oranges and Sunshine"" is almost too disturbing to be believed. And yet, remarkably, it is the true recounting of one of the largest scandals of the last few decades. In 1986, a British social worker named Margaret Humphreys started to piece together an amazing and harrowing story that involved the mass deportation of children from the United Kingdom to Australia. What she discovered was simply stunning. The scandal involved political corruption and cover-up, religious impropriety, human rights violations, slave labor, systematic abuse and a government program that divided hundreds of families and disappeared countless minor children. This is such a grand and epic tale, it's hard to imagine that a film discussing these atrocities wouldn't be aggressively in-your-face. But the beauty of ""Oranges and Sunshine"" is that it takes a quieter approach and as things start to unfold, the dramatic weight of the situation really sneaks up on you and bowls you over!A restrained Emily Watson plays Humphreys, a woman who didn't ask to be thrust into a worldwide spotlight. In the beginning of the film, she is approached by a woman for help finding her parents. This is when she firsts hears about children being shipped to Australia. Initially reticent and disbelieving, she soon hears a corroboration of this tale. She starts to dig deeper and push further, working between the U.K. and Australia to start repairing families. It consumes her life and livelihood, but she is pushed by a sense of justice. As word gets out, she is a savior to many but an embarrassment to others. And as the unfolding allegations put many important figures in an unfavorable light, she is soon discredited by many and attacked (both emotionally and physically). But as the investigation perseveres, there is soon no use denying the truth.Watson is so reserved to begin with, it is quite powerful to see the strain start to shatter her existence. It's a great performance in that it is completely underplayed and, therefore, all the more believable. Directed by Jim Loach (son of award winner Ken Loach), the film also boasts impressive support by David Wenham and Hugo Weaving. Both Weaving and Watson picked up actor accolades from Australian Film Critics Circle. As I watched the movie unravel fairly simply, I was sure I was going to give it four stars as a solid exploration of an unfathomable event. But then the magnitude and emotion really hit me in the concluding scenes and I realized just how well constructed the film actually was. With a minimum of histrionics, sentimentality, or moralizing, the screenplay and the actors really gets under your skin. And, in the end, I was deeply affected by ""Oranges and Sunshine"" because it didn't go for all the big expected moments. Understatement done extremely well!

1434536,A3CSDBDV77Z0VI,B004ZDY400,lily t.,"[1, 1]","There's a wonderfully written, well documented  book called White Cargo which covers 170 years, beginning in the Elizabethan period, when poor British subjects were deported to the colonies to work as 'indentured servants' but were often treated worse than African slaves, since they had not been paid for. Few outlived the terms their indenture because starvation, beatings, rapes and other tortures were commonplace. Many of the transported were children, orphaned, or  kidnapped from big cities and had very short lifespans, particularly if they had the misfortune to end up in the tobacco fields of the new world.Sadly, Britain returned to that policy in the post war era, with social services imposing their will on the poor or unwed and shipping confiscated children abroad instead of spending funds to care for them at home. Unfortunately once the children arrived at their destinations instead of being adopted they were [ again ] used as slave labor.This film recounts the story of a brave English social worker who discovers and exposes such cases in Australia after she is contacted by a woman who is searching for her birth mother. Once again the Catholic church shows up as the most inhumane of charities -and even if you thought the Magdalene laundries were heinous, nothing will prepare you for the neglect and shocking abuses, physical, mental, sexual and emotional that these children lived through at the hands of the 'Holy Bothers' and other incredibly predatory adults.Emily Watson plays the social worker as a model of restraint and tireless good will. Rather than being emotionally subdued, she beautifully 'holds space' for the adult survivors as they relive their harrowing stories, knowing that there is nothing one can do or say to make the trauma and pain go away or the victim feel better, until she herself begins to suffer from post traumatic disorder. Reads as a docudrama but is an important story with a terrific cast of supporting players.

This is an incredible, powerful, moving and gripping story (based on true events, and the book ""Empty Cradles"" by Margaret Humphreys).When you watch this movie you need to be in the mood for something like Schindler's list or the like.  This is NOT lighthearted ""entertainment"".In 1986 this story was uncovered by chance as one of these deported children returned (as an adult) to Great Britain desperately in search of who she really was, and happens upon social worker Margaret Humphreys. She tells Margaret that when she was a little girl she and hundreds of other kids were shipped from Great Britain to Australia, etc.  Margaret finds her story hard to believe, and more or less blows it off because how could this happen en mass.  Then another woman in a support group Margaret runs for adopted people mentions a lost brother who'd found her - who claimed the same deportation story.  Margaret begins looking into it and whoa tidal wave - this didn't happen to just a FEW kids it happened to over 130,000 children!  The kids aged 5-13 were shipped off, and told they had nobody and were nobody and were given an incredibly hard life (that's an understatement).  This happened in the 1940's through the 1970's (I think I have that span right)...  Decades after the news of this got out (in February 2010), Great Britain's Prime Minister Gordon Brown finally issued a full apology to those deported children and their families.Margaret listens to each of the deported children's stories and their memories, for as much information as she can gather on them in order to help them find out who they are, and find their families.  By doing this, she herself ends up with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder just from absorbing their pain - being strong for them.  But she doesn't quit - even when physically threatened.  She is all they've got.  Their stories are incredible - even as understated as this movie was.At the end of the movie it says that Margaret is STILL helping these deported children find out who they are today.

It was a shock, therefore, to learn that British authorities removed children from their homes and shipped them elsewhere as late as the 1970s. Someone in authority determined that a child's family was unfit and removed them  (without a hearing) and then sent them away to--wait for it--Australia. As adults some of these children made their way back to Britain to try to relocate their parents. They were fortunate to stumble upon a social worker, Margaret Humphries, who was willing to help.  The movie shows the struggles she had with with governmental authorities as she tried to reunite adult children with their families. The movie is very understated and lacks the warm fuzzy aspects of a Hallmark special. Some children did receive a happy ending but many did not. What happened to these children was shocking and Mrs Humphries suffered greatly for having revealed the sordid secrets of these children.

It makes us question how our own welfare system treats children.",5,Light,1345852800,"08 25, 2012",2012,868,"['are', 'moments', 'film', 'when', 'script', 'not', 'particularly', 'strong', 'moments', 'are', 'overcome', 'terrific', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'story', 'so', 'compelling', 'weakness', 'be', 'forgiven', 'have', 'ask', 'how', 'could', 'happen', 'civilized', 'country', 'mothers', 'stolen', 'children', 'are', 'poor', 'women', 'who', 'circumstances', 'can', 'not', 'care', 'children', 'program', 'went', 'century', 'Shipped', 'England', 'kids', 'had', 'living', 'family', 'who', 'were', 'lost', 'Placed', 'horrible', 'children', 'homes', 'circumstances', 'were', 'far', 'worse', 'poverty', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'saved', 'real', 'sunshine', 'films', 'shining', 'light', 'story', 'people', 'quest', 'reunite', 'families', 'tough', 'film', 'watch', 'question', 'how', 'own', 'welfare', 'system', 'children']",Oranges and Sunshine
1434545,AB1CKA6B849SP,B004ZDY400,zeus,"[1, 1]","Everybody wants to have a family.Margaret Humphries (Emily Watson) is a social worker that discovers one of the best kept secrets of the British government. During the 50's thousands of children were taken away from their parents and sent to labor camps in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and South Affrica. This movie only deals with the situation in Australia. The movie is very well done and Emily Watson is outstanding in her role. I personally think that the movie is well done and shows the raw emotions of the people who got severely damaged by the British government.This is a true story for which the British and Australian governments have apologized to the children in 2010, but the arrogant liberal Canadians who still think they know better, through their PM said in 2009 that they will not apologize. Below is the pathetic statement of the Canadian government through Jason Kinney who is still the Minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism (...sic) who apparently recognizes bad things only when there is public interest:""There's no need for Canada to apologize for abuse and exploitation suffered by thousands of poor children shipped here from Britain starting in the nineteenth century ... the issue has not been on the radar screen here, unlike Australia where there's been a long-standing interest. The reality is that, here in Canada, we are taking measures to recognize that sad period, but there is, I think, limited public interest in official government apologies for everything that's ever been unfortunate or [a] tragic event in our history.""You should read the story of ""home children"" that started in 1869. Annie MacPherson and Mary Rye started the entire ""slavery"" procedure. They thought they are doing the right thing. They took the children from the poor families and send them to labor camps in Australia where they suffered unspeakable horrors. Most of the adults today still try to recover from the horrors they suffered when they were young.It is a must see! Five stars all around. Emily Watson is just outstanding.",5,They just want to find their mother!,1358035200,"01 13, 2013",2013,2067,"['Everybody', 'have', 'family.Margaret', 'Humphries', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'social', 'worker', 'one', 'best', 'kept', 'secrets', 'British', 'government', '50', 'thousands', 'children', 'were', 'taken', 'away', 'parents', 'sent', 'labor', 'camps', 'Australia', 'Canada', 'New', 'Zealand', 'South', 'Affrica', 'movie', 'only', 'situation', 'Australia', 'movie', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'outstanding', 'role', 'personally', 'think', 'movie', 'well', 'done', 'raw', 'emotions', 'people', 'who', 'got', 'severely', 'damaged', 'British', 'government.This', 'true', 'story', 'British', 'Australian', 'governments', 'have', 'apologized', 'children', '2010', 'arrogant', 'liberal', 'Canadians', 'who', 'still', 'think', 'know', 'better', 'PM', 'said', '2009', 'will', 'not', 'apologize', 'Below', 'pathetic', 'statement', 'Canadian', 'government', 'Jason', 'Kinney', 'who', 'still', 'Minister', 'Citizenship', 'Immigration', 'Multiculturalism', 'sic', 'who', 'apparently', 'bad', 'things', 'only', 'when', 'public', 'interest', 'need', 'Canada', 'apologize', 'abuse', 'exploitation', 'suffered', 'thousands', 'poor', 'children', 'shipped', 'here', 'Britain', 'starting', 'nineteenth', 'century', 'issue', 'not', 'been', 'radar', 'screen', 'here', 'Australia', 'where', 'been', 'long-standing', 'interest', 'reality', 'here', 'Canada', 'are', 'taking', 'measures', 'recognize', 'sad', 'period', 'think', 'limited', 'public', 'interest', 'official', 'government', 'apologies', 'everything', 'ever', 'been', 'unfortunate', '[', ']', 'tragic', 'event', 'history', 'should', 'read', 'story', 'home', 'children', 'started', '1869', 'Annie', 'MacPherson', 'Mary', 'Rye', 'started', 'entire', 'slavery', 'procedure', 'thought', 'are', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'took', 'children', 'poor', 'families', 'send', 'labor', 'camps', 'Australia', 'where', 'suffered', 'unspeakable', 'horrors', 'Most', 'adults', 'today', 'still', 'try', 'recover', 'horrors', 'suffered', 'when', 'were', 'must', 'see', 'Five', 'stars', 'around', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'just', 'outstanding']",Oranges and Sunshine
