Muckman is his latest and although it's not his greatest, it still has more positives than negatives. Anju McIntyre aka AJ Khan, gives the film's best performance, and quite frankly the best performance of her career. She plays a celebrity who is a diva in every sense of the word, even considering murder to get what she wants. The Muckman monster is a creature who resembles The Swamp Thing. There are some good laughs in Muckman, as this plays out as more of a horror spoof than an actual horror film. Probably the only thing that holds Muckman back is its lack of exploitation elements. There is no nudity, although it comes close a couple of times. And there is very little gore, as well. Still, Muckman is fun for those who want to watch a light monster movie this Halloween season.",4,Another B-Movie Funfest From Brett Piper,1317427200,"10 1, 2011",2011,877,"['Brett', 'Piper', 'directed', 'many', 'b-movies', 'years', 'favorite', 'being', 'Bite', 'Me', 'Muckman', 'latest', 'not', 'greatest', 'still', 'more', 'positives', 'negatives', 'Anju', 'McIntyre', 'AJ', 'Khan', 'film', 'best', 'performance', 'quite', 'frankly', 'best', 'performance', 'career', 'celebrity', 'who', 'diva', 'sense', 'word', 'even', 'considering', 'murder', 'get', 'what', 'Muckman', 'monster', 'creature', 'who', 'Swamp', 'Thing', 'are', 'good', 'laughs', 'Muckman', 'out', 'more', 'horror', 'spoof', 'actual', 'horror', 'film', 'Probably', 'only', 'thing', 'Muckman', 'back', 'lack', 'exploitation', 'elements', 'nudity', 'close', 'couple', 'times', 'very', 'little', 'gore', 'as', 'well', 'Still', 'Muckman', 'fun', 'who', 'want', 'watch', 'light', 'monster', 'movie', 'Halloween', 'season']",Muckman

As a big Piper fan, I enjoyed his tribute to / parody of rural legends, and the shows that capitalize on them. The cast is funny, the story is simple (though slow at times), and the title creature is above average for a ""man-in-a-rubber-suit"" movie. There's even some cool stop-motion stuff near the end for added kicks!

1442883,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0055HK79M,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","First off, I will say that I quite enjoyed the concept of the low budget horror comedy ""Muckman.""  In the first few minutes, I chuckled at a clever send-up of reality television and its artifice and I thought that perhaps we might have discovered a gem.  But while I do think some will still enjoy this unassuming little endeavor, it fails to live up to the promise of a terrific premise.  Instead of maintaining the clever quotient, the humor quickly devolves into shtick with most of the amiable cast fumbling about like moronic bumpkins.  That's good for a laugh or two, but I really wanted a more effective screenplay with comedy that would bolster the story ideas as opposed to detracting from them.  Even in the final revelations, the film's plot has some nice twists--but the dialogue and overall execution is disappointing.The film details the exploits of a television crew as they search for the elusive monster of the title.  An original broadcast featuring this beast was exposed as a hoax and now the team seeks to repair the damage to their reputation.  All is not as it might seem, though.  Is the legendary Muckman real?  Or is something more sinister going on?  Dealing with the inbred locals, our inept squad may be in danger from creatures unknown and from each other.  The team's driver (Allison Whitney) is the only cast member to have half a brain and serves as a likable protagonist.  On the flip side, ambitious and ruthless investigative reporter A. J. Khan hits all the villainous marks in a delightfully over-the-top performance.Obviously, as a low budget effort, this won't win any special effects prizes.  It is efficient enough and cheesy enough to placate anyone with a familiarity to this type of creature feature.  Again, my primary disappointment stems from the screenplay.  Why?  Because there is something here--an actual story.  But the humor is so sophomoric, so expected.  I wanted the film's laughs to be equal to the clever narrative.  If that had happened, this might have really been a great little sleeper.  About 2 1/2 stars (on the bad movie scale), I could go either way--but I'll round up as this had actual potential.
