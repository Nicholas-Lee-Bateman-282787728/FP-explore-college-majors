The creation of Billith, Tara becoming a vampire, the Terry-Smoke-Monster thing... Nora.  I knew that Sookie's faery heritage was going to start to really play a larger role in the show, but I'm not exactly sure how I feel about it seeping into Andy's life in the form of 4 fae baby girls, abandoned by their mama immediately after their birth.I hope this leads into something in the sixth season that is a little more cohesive.  While I like to think of the books and the show as two completely separate entities, I do love the fact that the book has the characters directly in Sookie's life and not off on their own ridiculous and completely pointless adventures.  Like Alcide.  He's with her in the first episode or two and then he's off on his own and I don't see any instance where Sookie and Alcide are really going to intersect again.

The show has always been saddled with a profusion of less-than-interesting characters and mediocre actors. My favorites are generally the vampires, namely (in order of preference) Eric, Jessica, Russell, Pam and, once upon a time, Bill, though he's been pretty dull the last few seasons. Then there's Tara, Andy, all the shifters, all the werewolves and now all the faeries... all so immensely dull!  For some reason the producers felt obliged to lump each superhuman group into various dated, stereotyped human subcultures: vampires are goth, the werewolves are semi-biker trash, the shifters are hillbillies and now the faeries (so sinister and Gaiman-esque when they first appeared) have been reduced to bland Euro-trash sex-club ravers.The current central plot - of the inner vampire cabal staging a political coup - has some sharp moments of interest, but the revolving subplots are generally a drag. Terry's PTSD demon - meh. Tara's getting vamped: also has potential, but mainly because it keeps Pam in the spotlight. I always enjoy seeing Jessica onscreen, and oddly enough feel the same about Andy Lefleur. But Lafayette, Andy, Lilith and that werewolf dude are all the kiss of death. There's a remarkably high percentage of on-screen tedium for one show to handle. And of course the producers try to make up for it with lots of ""shocking"" sex scenes, but oh my god it that getting super-old. Nekkid bodies do not compensate for weak writing. ""True Blood"" has always been a trashy show -- that's why we watch it -- but there's trashy good and trashy-yawn, and even though I'm interested enough to keep watching, I wish the show would push itself a little.  The neutered, cartoonish representation of the faeries is particularly disappointing: very little creative thinking seems to have gone into their portrayal. And, omigod, I wish they'd drop the werewolves altogether.Anyway, the show continues to be interesting enough to watch, but just barely. I guess if I made it through ""Weeds,"" I can make it through this as well. Is Season Seven really going to be the last?  Well, let's hope they pick up the pace a little.

There are so many different subplots going on that it I am going to have to do a quick review of what happened in the previous seasons before the release of Season 6 to remind myself of what each character is doing.Just when we thought there couldn't be any more supernatural characters to introduce, this season also introduces supernatural creatures from arabic folklore called, &#34;irfrits&#34;, while maintaining its packs of werewolves, covens of witches, and clans of vampires. Here, too, the concept of vampire &#34;nesting&#34; is introduced, as we see Vampire Bill stray ever farther away from Sookie than before. Tara, Lafayette, and Pam begin a journey of their own as the story of Tara, the Vampire, begins. Vampires higher in the authority struggle for power in this season, leading to chaos and a new political regime. Meanwhile, the werewolves and shapeshifters have a beef with one another while trying to stay safe from an anonymous attack force aimed at supernaturals.The season is jumpy and leaves very little room for rest between episodes. They naturally fall into the next with plot twists and cliff hangers that leave the viewer dying to know what's coming next - a little more incisively than the previous few seasons. This is partially due to the highly divided nature and number of subplots wrapping around the story.

Sookie Stackhouse is a fabulous character, powerful yet still flawed and vulnerable at times...no matter how much she's gone through.Season 5 sees the fall-out from the last season and more, as people must come to terms with what their actions (or lack) have wrought.  The Big Heavy from past seasons, the infamous Vampire Authority, is finally shown.  Christopher Meloni does a fabulous job (as ever) with being the head of the Authority and the revelation of various vampire legends and religion is fascinating.  My only quibble was that it meant we spent WAY too much time in their super-secret underground bunker, which got to be kind of boring by the end.We also get to see Pam's past as various flashbacks unfold in different episodes, leading to a greater appreciation of her as a character.  These flashbacks make further sense as we see Pam trying to deal with becoming a Maker...and with what a child!!!  (OMG, seeing Pam in a sweatsuit--I couldn't stop laughing)  I think that Pam's stuff was wonderful, as it deepens our understanding of her so much, especially as she interacts with Tara.The Fairy aspect of the show also hasn't been forgotten, as we delve into Sookie's connection to that power in her bloodline and also go back in her family history to explore the death of her parents.  Jason also undergoes a big change as he takes a good hard look at his life.  Lafayette is also forced to deal with the consequences of what happened in the last season.  Tara also goes through a big change and I was practically on the verge of tears by the last episode re her changing relationship with Pam...who woulda thunk?The only story I wasn't thrilled out was Terry's, because I would have honestly wished to leave any supernatural elements out of that one, just as a counterpoint to all of the supe elements in the rest of the shows.

1584225,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B0092Q82LC,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[54, 76]","Oh, dear. Poor Sookie. After the great ending of the last season with Debbie blasting Tara, and in turn Sookie blowing Debbie's head off, I was so happy. It was going to guarantee that this season would A: Open with a moral dilemma for Sookie cold-bloodedly murdering someone, and B: Do away with the most annoying character this program has (Tara). And it was going to have Christopher Meloni, who stagnated far too long on SVU, to finally play a character that would allow him to have fun. Also, with Bill and Eric playing fugitive, that had some good character conflict set up immediately as well. This had all the earmarks of a very good start.Alas, none of these things were to be.The fact that I watched every episode of the season was something befuddling to me, because other than one of the episodes directed by Michael Lehmann, this was an even more confusing and increasingly frustrating season with just some flat-out ham-fisted story arcs.The main arc of the season was a not-bold-at-all-but-trying-to-be satire of rising fundamentalism and political and religious division in the United States where the Vampire Council slowly start to convert to a more fundamentalist belief that humans are their food, and they should not try to integrate at all but rather feed and kill at will according to the teachings of The Vampiric Bible and Lilith, the god of all vampires. On the human side of the spectrum, you have human groups in Bon Temps going around killing vampires and assorted ""freaks"", promoting the superiority of humans in the world. And then there's Sookie caught in the middle of everything, as per usual.There were so many problems with this season, it's hard to list them all without giving away some major plot points, but just about every single character on the show has an arc. The worst arc sadly belonging to Terry, one of my favorite characters, where we finally find out the reason he has PTSD. Of course, because it's TRUE BLOOD, instead of it having a reason that in something mundane, it has to be something supernatural and bat-poop crazy in nature. Even worse is the primary arc of Jason who knows, thanks to Sookie and her Lafayette-as-medium conversations with Gran, that their parents were indeed murdered by a vampire thanks to a generations-old contract that the Stackhouse family had with this one vampire. Loyalties, motivations and characterizations shift with no organic reasons other than, ""Oh, here's a new idea; let's have (character A) do (something bizarre) to, or with, (character B)"". That's usually not a very good way to get any kind of interesting conflict going, and that's most of what this season is: conflict for conflict's sake. The only story arc that seemed at all interesting was that of Alcide and his father, played by an increasingly grizzled Robert Patrick.Performances are still good for the most part, with the standouts being Alexander Skarsgard and Deborah Ann Woll. And the weak link of the cast still remains Rutina Wesley, but I don't think it's necessarily her fault as an actress, but more that Tara is just a cringe-inducing character.The truly bothersome part of the season is the idea of fundamentalism and extremism. Obviously this is the show's agenda to show how these ideas are tearing apart this country and the world, which is particularly pronounced with the pro-human groups wearing Obama masks when they murder the supers, because evidently, the show is trying to make some kind of political statement with that. By having them wear Obama masks is them showing an explicit statement, although, what that statement is, I have no idea. They could have just as easily worn Halloween masks, or ski masks or anything to hide their faces, but... Obama masks. It reeks of desperation to show a socio-political parallel where there doesn't need to be one. On the extremist side of the vampires, though, there is some fun to be had with the Council, which Roman (Meloni) is the leader of, alongside the original Salome (Valentina Cervi), who seems to find a new target of seduction with Bill.Naturally, there's a lot of sex and a lot more blood than in any of the previous seasons, and really it's more distracting window-dressing to keep viewers with gaping mouths rather than asking questions of just what the hell is going on.This is easily the worst season this show has had, and is going to be one of those shows that I'm going to become increasingly disinterested in if it keeps going in this direction.",2,Truly the worst season this show has had.,1351641600,"10 31, 2012",2012,4489,"['Oh', 'dear', 'Poor', 'Sookie', 'great', 'ending', 'last',

I bought season 1 on Blu-Ray just months ago and loved it so much I sought after the later seasons.  There were some things which I thought they focused on too much, like the sex scenes, but I assume some people love the sex scenes.  Ha.Anyway, season 5's ending is the most abrupt of all the endings in all the seasons thus far.  I have not seen season 6 yet, mind you, and there is a season 7 in the works.  You may want to wait for the series to end before watching it if you're the impatient type.  Consider yourself warned.The special features for season 5 are actually a lot more informative than those found in the previous seasons.  We get more information about the vampire bible, and we learn a lot more about Eric's backstory.  We also get a couple in-character monologues for Godric and Steve Newlin.

1584257,A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2,B0092Q82LC,"Kevin L. Nenstiel ""omnivore""","[1, 1]","HBO intended this series to dribble out over three months, but I think DVD is its true medium; it truly rewards binge watching. Free up a weekend and watch the whole season straight through. Grill burgers and pour yourself some red red wine. Because this intense season, in which the showrunners upend everything you think you know about Sookie's world, is so gripping that you won't want to pull away.Like prior seasons, this one begins mere minutes after the last ended. But it quickly ascends into revelations that undermine prior seasons. Sookie, previously presented as (almost) unfailingly good, proves capable of casual savagery, a capability that surprises her as much as us. Tara becomes a vampire in the first episode, which initially channels her anger, but also provides opportunities for touching moments of complexity.This season provides us our first direct view of the Vampire Authority, conveniently located a few hours' drive from the characters' home. It turns out to resemble less the technocratic dictatorship implied in Nan Flanagan's diatribes, and more the Vatican. Christopher Meloni occupies half the season as the vampires' pseudo-pope, a character just different enough from Elliot Stabler to be disconcerting.But as the religious implications of vampredom escalate, and old alliances get horse-traded faster than NFL jobs, we start to question what foundation vampire religion builds on. Vampire Bill, abjured by the Authority at the end of last season, plays the liturgical game with such panache that he quickly ascends to messianic status--a status that he, plagued by reality's ever-blurrier nature, he comes to believe.The crisp look of the series is enhanced by shooting key scenes on location in New Orleans. Previously, this show has tried to recreate Louisiana in Southern California by draping fake Spanish moss over pinyon pines and keeping the background in soft focus. Those of us who've lived in Louisiana rolled our eyes. This season actually looks like the Louisiana we know and (some of us) love, and it's a treat to behold.Longtime readers of Charlaine Harris' novels must begin this season by forgetting what they know about the books. With each season, this series has gotten further afield from Harris' original story arc, and with this one, the showrunners substantially leave her narrative behind. If you get hung up on authenticity, you'll never enjoy this series for what it is. Harris' novels and this series occupy parallel but separate universes.This is probably the first True Blood season you truly cannot jump into cold. While past seasons made attempts to hold doors open for new viewers, this one contains so many callbacks to past events, and so many reversals of what longtime viewers think they know, that newcomers will, I'm sure, feel only confused. If you're new to True Blood, please start from the beginning. DVDs and downloads are cheap.But for longstanding viewers who can watch this series on its own terms, this season provides just the sucker punch necessary to keep a long-lived show fresh. Alan Ball's take on Charlaine Harris' setting keeps reinventing itself, remaining alive and resisting the temptation toward comfy repetition that plagues many older shows. With its massive revelations and cliffhanger ending, this season promises only more and better to come.",4,Everything You Know Is Wrong,1374364800,"07 21, 2013",2013,3342,"['HBO', 'intended', 'series', 'dribble', 'out', 'three', 'months', 'think', 'DVD', 'true', 'medium', 'truly', 'binge', 'watching', 'Free', 'up', 'weekend', 'watch', 'whole', 'season', 'straight', 'Grill', 'burgers', 'pour', 'red', 'red', 'wine', 'intense', 'season', 'showrunners', 'upend', 'everything', 'think', 'know', 'Sookie', 'world', 'so', 'gripping', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'pull', 'prior', 'seasons', 'one', 'mere', 'minutes', 'last', 'ended', 'quickly', 'revelations', 'undermine', 'prior', 'seasons', 'Sookie', 'previously', 'presented', 'almost', 'unfailingly', 'good', 'capable', 'casual', 'savagery', 'capability', 'as', 'much', 'Tara', 'vampire', 'first', 'episode', 'initially', 'anger', 'also', 'opportunities', 'touching', 'moments', 'complexity.This', 'season', 'first', 'direct', 'view', 'Vampire', 'Authority', 'conveniently', 'located', 'few', 'hours', 'drive', 'characters', 'home', 'out', 'resemble', 'less', 'technocratic', 'dictatorship', 'implied', 'Nan', 'Flanagan', 'diatribes', 'more', 'Vatican', 'Christopher', 'Meloni', 'season', 'vampires', 'pseudo-pope', 'character', 'just', 'different', 'enough', 'Elliot', 'Stabler', 'be', 'disconcerting.But', 'religious', 'implications', 'vampredom', 'escalate', 'old', 'alliances', 'get', 'horse-traded', 'faster', 'NFL', 'jobs', 'start', 'question', 'what', 'foundation', 'vampire', 'religion', 'builds', 'Vampire', 'Bill', 'abjured', 'Authority', 'end', 'last', 'season', 'liturgical', 'game', 'such', 'panache', 'quickly', 'messianic', 'status', 'status', 'plagued', 'reality', 'ever-blurrier', 'nature', 'believe.The', 'crisp', 'look', 'series', 'enhanced', 'shooting', 'key', 'scenes', 'location', 'New', 'Orleans', 'Previously', 'show', 'tried', 'recreate', 'Louisiana', 'Southern', 'California', 'draping', 'fake', 'Spanish', 'moss', 'pinyon', 'pines', 'keeping', 'background', 'soft', 'focus', 'who', ""'ve"", 'lived', 'Louisiana', 'rolled', 'eyes', 'season', 'actually', 'Louisiana', 'know', 'love', 'treat', 'behold.Longtime', 'readers', 'Charlaine', 'Harris', 'novels', 'must', 'begin', 'season', 'forgetting', 'what', 'know', 'books', 'season', 'series', 'gotten', 'further', 'afield', 'Harris', 'original', 'story', 'arc', 'one', 'showrunners', 'substantially', 'leave', 'narrative', 'behind', 'get', 'hung', 'up', 'authenticity', ""'ll"", 'never', 'enjoy', 'series', 'what', 'Harris', 'novels', 'series', 'parallel', 'separate', 'universes.This', 'probably', 'first', 'True', 'Blood', 'season', 'truly', 'can', 'not', 'jump', 'cold', 'past', 'seasons', 'made', 'attempts', 'hold', 'doors', 'open', 'new', 'viewers', 'one', 'so', 'many', 'callbacks', 'past', 'events', 'so', 'many', 'reversals', 'what', 'longtime', 'viewers', 'think', 'know', 'newcomers', 'will', ""'m"", 'sure', 'feel', 'only', 'confused', ""'re"", 'new', 'True', 'Blood', 'please', 'start', 'beginning', 'DVDs', 'downloads', 'are', 'cheap.But', 'longstanding', 'viewers', 'who', 'can', 'watch', 'series', 'own', 'terms', 'season', 'just', 'sucker', 'punch', 'necessary', 'keep', 'long-lived', 'show', 'fresh', 'Alan', 'Ball', 'take', 'Charlaine', 'Harris', 'setting', 'keeps', 'reinventing', 'remaining', 'alive', 'resisting', 'temptation', 'comfy', 'repetition', 'many', 'older', 'shows', 'massive', 'revelations', 'cliffhanger', 'ending', 'season', 'only', 'more', 'better', 'come']",N/A

TB has been inventive, well done and a refreshing alternative to mundane network programming.  However, Season 5 finds the drama perhaps needing a blood transfusion.  Much of what's kept the show so addictive is lost in the superfluous mini-arcs this season.  While appreciating attempts to supply all its cast their ""place in the spotlight"", these arcs were often more a distraction than an enhancement e.g. the smoke monster, the Obama vigilante group and the overly emphasized religious and political barnstorming in the Authority plotline.Casting was a little disappointing as well.Both Christopher Meloni's character and performance were less than stellar.  The former SVU stalwart didn't bring anything special to the role of Roman.  Standout performances came this season from Deborah Ann Woll (Jessica), Jim Parrack (Hoyt), Kristin Bauer (Pam), Chris Bauer (Andy) and Ryan Kwanten (Jason).  Anna Paquin's Sookie had a more secondary presence this season probably due to her pregnancy and this lessening had a noticeable impact.

The majority of the season is spent in the underground lair of The Authority, the vampire governing body, and we are introduced to wonderful new characters like Roman and the dangerous Salome. The Authority initially vows to destroy Russell and the threat he poses to all the progress made in human-vampire relations.As expected, things don't quite turn out the way they are supposed to - and this happens pretty early on. True Blood works best when it is operating within sheer insanity and Season 5 illustrates that beautifully. We get to see the demented fairy nightclub, a fiery Iraqi smoke demon, and an angry vampire goddess throughout the course of 12 episodes that literally fly by.In addition to all the sheer chaos taking place, Season 5 maintains True Blood's status as a genuine horror TV show. This season is full of truly scary moments, especially because we the audience do not know how powerful these creatures are. How much of a threat can they pose to the characters we love? And what do we have to do to kill them?What I like best about the season, however, is that it finally addresses the long-waiting issue of how the vampires should deal with their identity. Is mainstreaming a good idea? Is being accepted by society worth compromising who they are, or should they embrace their inherently brutal animalistic vampire selves?The season finale is a phenomenon on its own, bringing together all the madness without quite wrapping up every loose end.

1584354,A3I4XJW0NJROQ2,B0092Q82LC,w.s.,"[174, 181]","The Bon Temps gang returns for the fifth season of HBO's ""True Blood"". I am a colossal fan of the show, having seen every episode since the pilot. Like every show, ""True Blood"" has had a few ups and downs in terms of writing. Seasons one and two were the show at its best, in my opinion. Season three was a lot of fun, but suffered from cluttered storylines and tonal problems. But, season four -- although it still can't top season one or two -- was a solid return to form (and I can't understand the bashing it regularly receives on here from other fans).So, how does season five compare? I found this year to be even better than the last; the most compelling reason for this is the fundamental shaking up of all things comfortable and familiar on the show. All of the close relationships have been compromised or changed or they've grown apart: Sookie/Bill/Eric, Sookie/Tara, Pam/Eric, Jason/Hoyt, Tara/Lafayette, etc. This was the year of the Break Up (friendships as well as romances). But, the interesting thing is how this made way for all sorts of new and compelling bonds to form: Bill/Eric, Pam/Tara, Jason/Jessica.Season five was definitely a game-changer (probably because it was creator Alan Ball's farewell season). There isn't even a clear-cut Big Bad this year. The villain could be seen as The Authority and through our infiltration of the system this year, we get the sense of just how ambiguous the concepts of right and wrong, good and bad really are to the vampires of the True Blood 'verse. The most compelling part about this story is finally getting to see the inner workings of the Authority and how fundamentally it changes both Bill and Eric (especially toward the latter half of the season). The members of the Authority themselves, though, are a mixed bag. Christopher Meloni proves himself to be the awesome actor he is as Roman, but he's sadly underused during the season. Valentina Cervi didn't really do it for me as Salome, neither did Lucy Griffiths as Eric's vampire sister Nora.The regular actors, however, were all in top form. It was a refreshing change to see Anna Paquin's Sookie almost entirely unattached romantically. It led for some interesting directions for her character to go in, as well as Ryan Kwanten as Jason (who had what was probably his most powerful arc this year). Stephen Moyer and Alexander Skarsgard reportedly had a blast filming this season and having Bill and Eric be partners in crime instead of foes and competitors for Sookie's heart. This sense of fun really does show and highlights the fact that these two do have great screen chemistry together.But, my favorite part of this season was the pairing of Pam and Tara. It was a brilliant turn of writing, in many ways. Tara started off as a great and complex character: troubled but also strong, smart, and resourceful, as well as very funny. But, around the time of season three, she became the ""eternal victim"" in a way that was really running out of steam. Having her reborn as a baby vamp really breathed new life into the character and Rutina Wesley did a fantastic job of convincingly reinventing Tara while retaining her essence. Her scenes with Kristin Bauer van Straten were easily some of the best moments of the season, as these two actresses have wonderful chemistry. Kristin also had what was her best season yet, getting able to reveal new dimensions as well as the past of our favorite sardonic vampire Pam.As great as this season was, it wasn't perfect. My sole criticism for True Blood is that they stop with all of the extra story lines. Not every character needs their own arc on the show. Supporting characters, like Terry, Arlene, and Holly, can remain just that. SUPPORTING characters in the story lines of the more primary ones. Some of the fat I believe could've been trimmed included Terry's Ifrit drama, Holly and Andy's romance, and some of Alcide's wolf pack politics. Even Lafayette (one of my favorites) didn't have much interesting to do this year.Luckily, by the time of the season finale, the writers did a good job of streamlining most of the stories into one cohesive finish. And what a finish it was!
