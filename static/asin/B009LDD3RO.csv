It is amazing how the people of New Orleans have managed to work through their problems, trials, disappointments, and tragedies. They have tried to overcome many obstacles and adversities. That is what some of the people have tried to do since their devasting ordeal with the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.

1598622,AI1HCK9KJ5QX7,B009LDD3RO,JB,"[0, 0]","Treme's third season is an exercise in patience (even compared to its first two). Because the show was renewed for a third and a short fourth season, the third does not have the complete arcs that characterized seasons one and two, and no strong theme emerges. Instead, it plays as a more detached exploration of the lives of the various characters. There also isn't nearly as much new ground explored here; we're mostly sticking with the established characters and settings, the most notable edition being a new character who is basically a muckraking reporter.However, the third season serves to set up the show's preplanned conclusion in season four, and in that it succeeds.

We started out in season one with the after affects of Katrina, up close and personal. The hurricane smashed the city, the families, and lives of it's inhabitants. Season one told their stories, season two told of their efforts to reclaim, and, now, season three shows us how they are all connected.Treme is a series based on New Orleans musicians. It brings us a series of characters who are musicians or work with them, or have a place where musicians congregate. Music is the basis of the parade. When I think of New Orleans, I think of the parades, and 'Treme' three is a parade. A journalist shows up to help a lawyer follow the leads to a murderer, a down and out former addict musician finds his way to sobriety, a chef moves back from New York to her own restaurant, a bar owner tries to find her rapist, a young student wants to find her dreams, a good cop battles corruption, a favored musician receives a cancer diagnosis,and a trombonist teaching music at a school tries to find his way to the big time. A lot going on, and all of these characters have a subtle connection to each other. One or the other of these people find themselves embroiled in new situations and discover Katrina was just a jumping place for life.Season three seemed to make the connections of what was going wrong and what could change to make lives better. The dreams that were realized were not always the thrill of a lifetime. And, as ever, the music was what held this series together. The music of New Orleans is riveting and life affirming. The beat and the bass and the mood it sets is New Orleans. We had some closure of troubles and doors still left open. We have Season Four to come with five more episodes. I am so looking forward to Treme, the finale.Highly Recommended. prisrob 02-25-13",4,It's All Connected,1361750400,"02 25, 2013",2013,1919,"[""'Treme"", 'third', 'season', 'brought', 'characters', 'Hurricane', 'Katrina', 'plot', 'lines', 'person', 'together', 'show', 'connections', 'started', 'out', 'season', 'one', 'affects', 'Katrina', 'up', 'close', 'personal', 'hurricane', 'smashed', 'city', 'families', 'lives', 'inhabitants', 'Season', 'one', 'told', 'stories', 'season', 'two', 'told', 'efforts', 'reclaim', 'now', 'season', 'three', 'how', 'are', 'connected.Treme', 'series', 'based', 'New', 'Orleans', 'musicians', 'series', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'musicians', 'work', 'have', 'place', 'where', 'musicians', 'congregate', 'Music', 'basis', 'parade', 'When', 'think', 'New', 'Orleans', 'think', 'parades', 'three', 'parade', 'journalist', 'up', 'help', 'lawyer', 'leads', 'murderer', 'down', 'former', 'addict', 'musician', 'way', 'sobriety', 'chef', 'back', 'New', 'York', 'own', 'restaurant', 'bar', 'owner', 'tries', 'find', 'rapist', 'young', 'student', 'find', 'dreams', 'good', 'cop', 'battles', 'corruption', 'favored', 'musician', 'cancer', 'diagnosis', 'trombonist', 'teaching', 'music', 'school', 'tries', 'find', 'way', 'big', 'time', 'lot', 'going', 'characters', 'have', 'subtle', 'connection', 'other', 'One', 'other', 'people', 'find', 'embroiled', 'new', 'situations', 'discover', 'Katrina', 'was', 'just', 'jumping', 'place', 'life.Season', 'three', 'seemed', 'make', 'connections', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'wrong', 'what', 'could', 'change', 'make', 'lives', 'better', 'dreams', 'were', 'realized', 'were', 'not', 'always', 'thrill', 'lifetime', 'ever', 'music', 'was', 'what', 'held', 'series', 'together', 'music', 'New', 'Orleans', 'riveting', 'life', 'affirming', 'beat', 'bass', 'mood', 'New', 'Orleans', 'had', 'closure', 'troubles', 'doors', 'still', 'left', 'open', 'have', 'Season', 'Four', 'come', 'five', 'more', 'episodes', 'am', 'so', 'looking', 'forward', 'Treme', 'finale.Highly', 'Recommended', 'prisrob', '02-25-13']",N/A

Our son moved there not long after Katrina and we visit often, the first time when there were still black X's on houses and whole blocks were sitting abandoned.  I thought that the first season was a really good portrayal of NOLA in the first couple of years after the storm.  My New Orleans friends concur.  As the series progressed into Season II, it was still a pretty good picture.
