559261,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B00004YKQV,Acute Observer,"[0, 0]","Great Guy, 1936 filmThe film begins at an office in the city. Marty Cavanaugh talks to his boys about a man in a hospital. Joel Green was injured in a traffic accident. Johnny Cave visits him and it told who did it. Johnny is acting head of Weights and Measures. He is against the cheating of housewives who buy food. Or taking bribes to overlook infractions. [We see a grocery store from the 1930s, compare it to today's stores.] How much does that chicken weigh? [Note those prices.] Gas is sold by the gallon, not by cash. [Does this cheating go on today? You may read about it.] The office is open to 6pm. Marty Cavanaugh invites Johnny to join his political club. [Do they have these in your city?] Will he fix a summons? No. Will there be retaliation? Kidnapping in broad daylight? Will Johnny be framed for drunk driving and a hold-up? We see who this works, it was just a warning.We see a furniture store and its prices. [No housing shortages.] Johnny gets a call from the Mayor, he is praised for a 53% increase in violations. Johnny is offered a better paying job as a Tax Commissioner for the Governor, but he refuses. We see how the Orphanage was swindled of supplies. Selecting a supplier can be lucrative. Johnny catches another short count. Then he learns about paying for a passport. Cave tells a reporter about Canning's swindling of an orphanage. [Remember when a big city had many competitive newspapers?] What if all the records of corruption can be made to disappear? What if the thief wants a lot more money? Without proof from the records can Johnny be accused of blackmail? Will his girl Janet reject him? Suspects can be arrested and held with no rights. Can Burton's place be searched without a warrant?There is a formal party, many attend. Johnny too. Burton gets a check made out to `cash'. Will there be a problem? Johnny learns of the connection to Canning. He returns to Burton's apartment and finds Cavanaugh and Canning there. It looks bad for Johnny. But the police arrive in time to save Johnny and the records. There is action in the apartment. There will be a happy ending for Johnny and Janet. Can they live happily ever after?This movie tells how petty corruption can cost the public a lot of money. It shows how costs for public institutions can be padded to provide graft for businesses and their friendly politicians. You will probably never find a dishonest politician without some wealthy businessmen behind him. This story tells about the small-fry, not the big fish who control and influence politicians.",3,Corruption in a Big City,1289520000,"11 12, 2010",2010,2550,"['Great', 'Guy', '1936', 'filmThe', 'film', 'office', 'city', 'Marty', 'Cavanaugh', 'talks', 'boys', 'man', 'hospital', 'Joel', 'Green', 'was', 'injured', 'traffic', 'accident', 'Johnny', 'Cave', 'told', 'who', 'did', 'Johnny', 'acting', 'head', 'Weights', 'Measures', 'cheating', 'housewives', 'who', 'buy', 'food', 'taking', 'bribes', 'overlook', 'infractions', '[', 'see', 'grocery', 'store', '1930s', 'compare', 'today', 'stores', ']', 'How', 'much', 'chicken', 'weigh', '[', 'Note', 'prices', ']', 'Gas', 'sold', 'gallon', 'not', 'cash', '[', 'cheating', 'go', 'today', 'may', 'read', ']', 'office', 'open', '6pm', 'Marty', 'Cavanaugh', 'Johnny', 'join', 'political', 'club', 'Do', 'have', 'city', ']', 'Will', 'fix', 'summons', 'Will', 'there', 'be', 'retaliation', 'Kidnapping', 'broad', 'daylight', 'Will', 'Johnny', 'be', 'framed', 'drunk', 'driving', 'hold-up', 'see', 'who', 'was', 'just', 'warning.We', 'see', 'furniture', 'store', 'prices', '[', 'housing', 'shortages', ']', 'Johnny', 'call', 'Mayor', 'praised', '53', '%', 'increase', 'violations', 'Johnny', 'offered', 'better', 'paying', 'job', 'Tax', 'Commissioner', 'Governor', 'see', 'how', 'Orphanage', 'was', 'swindled', 'supplies', 'Selecting', 'supplier', 'can', 'be', 'lucrative', 'Johnny', 'short', 'count', 'Then', 'paying', 'passport', 'Cave', 'reporter', 'Canning', 'swindling', 'orphanage', '[', 'Remember', 'when', 'big', 'city', 'had', 'many', 'competitive', 'newspapers', ']', 'What', 'records', 'corruption', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'disappear', 'What', 'thief', 'lot', 'more', 'money', 'proof', 'records', 'can', 'Johnny', 'be', 'accused', 'blackmail', 'Will', 'girl', 'Janet', 'reject', 'Suspects', 'can', 'be', 'arrested', 'held', 'rights', 'Can', 'Burton', 'place', 'be', 'searched', 'warrant', 'formal', 'party', 'many', 'attend', 'Johnny', 'too', 'Burton', 'check', 'made', 'out', 'cash', 'Will', 'there', 'be', 'problem', 'Johnny', 'connection', 'Canning', 'Burton', 'apartment', 'Cavanaugh', 'Canning', 'there', 'bad', 'Johnny', 'police', 'arrive', 'time', 'save', 'Johnny', 'records', 'action', 'apartment', 'will', 'be', 'happy', 'ending', 'Johnny', 'Janet', 'Can', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'movie', 'how', 'petty', 'corruption', 'can', 'cost', 'public', 'lot', 'money', 'how', 'costs', 'public', 'institutions', 'can', 'be', 'padded', 'provide', 'graft', 'businesses', 'friendly', 'politicians', 'will', 'probably', 'never', 'find', 'dishonest', 'politician', 'wealthy', 'businessmen', 'story', 'small-fry', 'not', 'big', 'fish', 'who', 'control', 'influence', 'politicians']",N/A

It's not especially complicated or insightful; it won't give you a new perception into the depths of the human experience.  But for a film that barely lasts for over an hour, it's an entertaining chunk of action that's well worth viewing.Since the running time of this film is only an hour and six minutes (the back of the DVD package incorrectly lists this as 75 minutes) one won't be surprised to find that this isn't a terribly demanding movie.  But it's certainly engaging, and it's quite enjoyable to watch James Cagney as an official in the Office of Weights and Measures going around thumping people who don't perform up to their required specifications.  The jokes all work and the action sequences are executed well.The DVD isn't in great shape, though as this is a budget release one would suspect that this might be the case.  The picture is a bit scratchy and there are numerous jumps and slight cuts in the action.  The sound quality has similar flaws; several popping noises and other numerous audible distractions abound during the running of this DVD.This is a fun film that's recommended to fans of James Cagney.  It's a pleasant way to while away an hour of a Saturday afternoon if you find yourself with some time to kill.  The Laserlight DVD itself contains a few flaws, so you may want to try to find a better version of the film.",3,"Silly title, fun movie",1015718400,"03 10, 2002",2002,1512,"['Please', 'note', 'DVD', 'edition', 'am', 'reviewing', 'bare-bones', 'Laserlight', 'release', 'film', 'precious', 'little', 'else', 'GREAT', 'GUY', 'fun', 'film', 'not', 'especially', 'complicated', 'insightful', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'new', 'perception', 'depths', 'human', 'experience', 'film', 'barely', 'hour', 'entertaining', 'chunk', 'action', 'well', 'worth', 'viewing.Since', 'running', 'time', 'film', 'only', 'hour', 'six', 'minutes', 'back', 'DVD', 'package', 'incorrectly', '75', 'minutes', 'one', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'find', ""n't"", 'terribly', 'demanding', 'movie', 'certainly', 'engaging', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'James', 'Cagney', 'official', 'Office', 'Weights', 'Measures', 'going', 'thumping', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'perform', 'up', 'required', 'specifications', 'jokes', 'work', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'executed', 'well.The', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'great', 'shape', 'though', 'budget', 'release', 'one', 'would', 'suspect', 'might', 'be', 'case', 'picture', 'bit', 'scratchy', 'are', 'numerous', 'jumps', 'slight', 'cuts', 'action', 'sound', 'quality', 'similar', 'flaws', 'several', 'popping', 'noises', 'other', 'numerous', 'audible', 'distractions', 'abound', 'running', 'DVD.This', 'fun', 'film', 'recommended', 'fans', 'James', 'Cagney', 'pleasant', 'way', 'while', 'away', 'hour', 'Saturday', 'afternoon', 'find', 'time', 'kill', 'Laserlight', 'DVD', 'few', 'flaws', 'may', 'want', 'try', 'find', 'better', 'version', 'film']",N/A

There seem to be two puzzles in this tale of civic virtue, however. First, Jimmy is pure as the driven snow. At the end of the story he presents his lady-love with a piece of ice a little smaller than the Ritz. He tells her he bought it on the never-never. Not long before committing this rash deed he had picked up, unseen by anyone, a cheque for 5G, made out to cash, signed by one of the evil politicians. How come we never saw this handy piece of paper turned in as exhibit A? The second puzzle is much more serious. Why would a great guy like this ever want to marry a dame like Mae Clarke?

In ""Great Guy"" he plays chief pro-temp of the Bureau of Weights and Measures and tries to root-out the thugs who cheat people out of money by fixing their scales. He gets kicked around quite a bit but gives as good as he gets. In one scene he's completely tossed upside down in the air and slammed against the wall. It's hilarious but stunning at the same time. Throughout the film he's bribed, beaten and even framed--in a scene remarkably similar to his framing in ""Each Dawn I Die."" Even a little romance is thrown in for good measure with Mae Clarke whom he ""grapefruited"" in Public Enemy. I can't see this film being remotely interesting with any other actor than James Cagney. It's actors like him that bring such magnetism to the screen and make even the ordinary extraordinary. This film has a lot of laughs and knocking people about and the ending sequence has some of the best fight-staging I've ever seen.

559268,A2BGGXUQAFQ2HC,B00004YKQV,Mrs.,"[0, 0]","Great Guy is a 1936 crime film starring James Cagney and Mae Clark.  The story is fast-moving and entertaining.  The straight-forward storyline is lifted above the average by Cagney's genius for amplifying what would otherwise be a mundane scene with his off-the-cuff humor and wisecracks.Comic relief is also supplied by James Burke as the dreamy, tall-tale-spinning but honest and loyal Aloysius Haley, another member of the New York Department of Weights and Measures.The story: Joel Green, the honest Chief Deputy of the New York Department of Weights and Measures, is seriously injured in a traffic accident arranged by corrupt Alderman Marty Cavanaugh (Robert Gleckler) and his gang.  The accident, meant to kill Green, only injures him and Green summons Johnny Cave (Cagney)  to meet with him in the hospital.Knowing Johnny to be honest and principled, Green informs Johnny that  he (Johnny) is the new Chief Deputy of the Department of Weights and Measures.  But Green warns Johnny that Cavanaugh and his gang were responsible for the accident, and to ""keep his head on his shoulders and his fists in his pockets.""  Green also warns Johnny that someone higher up than Cavanaugh is ultimately responsible for the violence against the honest Weights and Measures officials but hasn't yet determined who.Johnny and Aloysius team up to inspect a grocery store that is known for cheating customers, and a gas station  with pumps that record a greater amount of liquid than what is dispensed.  In both places, the vendors attempt to bribe Johnny to ignore the infractions, but to no avail.Marty Cavanaugh tries to bring Johnny into his gang with the promise of money, fine clothes etc, and when Johnny refuses, Cavanaugh's thugs frame Johnny for a drunk-driving accident.Johnny continues to uncover corruption at ever-increasing levels of government, resisting ever more lucrative bribes of money and cushy jobs.Johnny finally alerts his friends at the newspapers that Mr. Canning, his fiance's boss, is cheating on the deliveries to the city orphanage.  The story runs and papers are drawn up for the City Prosecutor to go after the crooked officials.  The papers are stolen and after much effort recovered.Mae Clarke plays Janet Henry, Johnny's fianc&eacute;.  The young couple is saving up to be married in a few weeks, but complications ensue when Johnny uncovers that Mr. Canning, Janet's boss, is part of the crime ring.More comic relief is supplied by the fact that the young lover's only place to romance each other is on the sofas at the local furniture store, and the annoyed salesman is constantly intruding.Edward Brophy gives a fun performance as Johnny's old boxing buddy Pete Reilly.Interesting to note how one of the gags from this film is used 40 years later in another film. Early in the film, Cagney's character is speaking on the phone to his fianc&eacute;, who is loudly berating him.  He hangs up on her in the middle of her tirade, licks his finger, touches the phone quickly, jerking back his finger as if burned, makes a sizzling sound with his mouth and says ""red hot""!A note on the quality:  this film has lines and some background crackling, and in a few places there is a break in the picture and sound where some of the film seems missing.  Just to note this ""for the record"", not as a complaint because I've personally always found these qualities charming in an old film.",5,"Smart, quick, witty Cagney....and he's a good guy!",1361145600,"02 18, 2013",2013,3405,"['Great', 'Guy', '1936', 'crime', 'film', 'starring', 'James', 'Cagney', 'Mae', 'Clark', 'story', 'fast-moving', 'entertaining', 'straight-forward', 'storyline', 'lifted', 'average', 'Cagney', 'genius', 'amplifying', 'what', 'would', 'otherwise', 'be', 'mundane', 'scene', 'off-the-cuff', 'humor', 'wisecracks.Comic', 'relief', 'also', 'supplied', 'James', 'Burke', 'dreamy', 'tall-tale-spinning', 'honest', 'loyal', 'Aloysius', 'Haley', 'member', 'New', 'York', 'Department', 'Weights', 'Measures.The', 'story', 'Joel', 'Green', 'honest', 'Chief', 'Deputy', 'New', 'York', 'Department', 'Weights', 'Measures', 'seriously', 'injured', 'traffic', 'accident', 'arranged', 'corrupt', 'Alderman', 'Marty', 'Cavanaugh', 'Robert', 'Gleckler', 'gang', 'accident', 'meant', 'kill', 'Green', 'only', 'Green', 'summons', 'Johnny', 'Cave', 'Cagney', 'meet', 'hospital.Knowing', 'Johnny', 'be', 'honest', 'principled', 'Green', 'informs', 'Johnny', 'Johnny', 'new', 'Chief', 'Deputy', 'Department', 'Weights', 'Measures', 'Green', 'Johnny', 'Cavanaugh', 'gang', 'were', 'responsible', 'accident', 'keep', 'head', 'shoulders', 'fists', 'pockets', 'Green', 'also', 'Johnny', 'someone', 'higher', 'Cavanaugh', 'ultimately', 'responsible', 'violence', 'honest', 'Weights', 'Measures', 'officials', ""n't"", 'yet', 'determined', 'who.Johnny', 'Aloysius', 'team', 'up', 'inspect', 'grocery', 'store', 'known', 'cheating', 'customers', 'gas', 'station', 'pumps', 'record', 'greater', 'amount', 'liquid', 'what', 'dispensed', 'places', 'vendors', 'attempt', 'bribe', 'Johnny', 'ignore', 'infractions', 'avail.Marty', 'Cavanaugh', 'tries', 'bring', 'Johnny', 'gang', 'promise', 'money', 'fine', 'clothes', 'etc', 'when', 'Johnny', 'Cavanaugh', 'thugs', 'frame', 'Johnny', 'drunk-driving', 'accident.Johnny', 'uncover', 'corruption', 'ever-increasing', 'levels', 'government', 'resisting', 'ever', 'more', 'lucrative', 'bribes', 'money', 'cushy', 'jobs.Johnny', 'finally', 'friends', 'newspapers', 'Mr.', 'Canning', 'fiance', 'boss', 'cheating', 'deliveries', 'city', 'orphanage', 'story', 'runs', 'papers', 'are', 'drawn', 'up', 'City', 'Prosecutor', 'go', 'crooked', 'officials', 'papers', 'are', 'stolen', 'much', 'effort', 'recovered.Mae', 'Clarke', 'Janet', 'Henry', 'Johnny', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'young', 'couple', 'saving', 'up', 'be', 'married', 'few', 'weeks', 'complications', 'ensue', 'when', 'Johnny', 'uncovers', 'Mr.', 'Canning', 'Janet', 'boss', 'part', 'crime', 'ring.More', 'comic', 'relief', 'supplied', 'fact', 'young', 'lover', 'only', 'place', 'romance', 'other', 'sofas', 'local', 'furniture', 'store', 'annoyed', 'salesman', 'constantly', 'intruding.Edward', 'Brophy', 'fun', 'performance', 'Johnny', 'old', 'boxing', 'buddy', 'Pete', 'Reilly.Interesting', 'note', 'how', 'one', 'gags', 'film', 'used', '40', 'years', 'later', 'film', 'Early', 'film', 'Cagney', 'character', 'speaking', 'phone', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'who', 'loudly', 'berating', 'up', 'middle', 'tirade', 'finger', 'phone', 'quickly', 'jerking', 'back', 'finger', 'burned', 'sizzling', 'sound', 'mouth', 'red', 'hot', 'note', 'quality', 'film', 'lines', 'background', 'crackling', 'few', 'places', 'break', 'picture', 'sound', 'where', 'film', 'missing', 'Just', 'note', 'record', 'not', 'complaint', ""'ve"", 'personally', 'always', 'found', 'qualities', 'charming', 'old', 'film']",N/A
