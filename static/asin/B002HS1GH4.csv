In my mind, this debate moves the FPF strongly toward the realm of neutrality, and honest inquiry. This ""conversation"" happened afterThe God Delusion Debate, and had I have not had the misfortune of watching that catastrophe, I would have proclaimed ""Has Science Buried God?"" did only slightly more than live up to expectations. However, this turned out to be a pleasant surprise.Both of these men are obviously very skilled in their fields of science and mathematics and very capable of explaining their stances. I did have a problem with Dawkins not following up in his traditional rhetorical fashion. I believe he kept the conversation too civil. There was another commentator in the end who agreed and said both men were ""entirely too polite."" Unfortunately, with ""polite"" comes ""less revealing."" Maybe Dawkins has a respect for Lennox that he doesn't have for other theologians he encounters; or, maybe it was the venue being his prior place of employment. There were too many valid points that Dawkins dropped the ball on for my liking. At every point, he allowed Lennox to save face and jump topics which seemed weak from my stance. With that side, I'm an Atheist and I have a very high bar for Dawkins.I don't believe either side can credit any potential faults in this conversation to the other party. It was rather unmoderated -- the FPF did exceptionally well in this. In the end, both of the participants performed fairly well -- even if there was nothing truly exceptional and new and even if neither of them gave up much ground because of the lack of persistence or verbal agility by the other member.",4,Very surprising given the other debate I've seen by the FPF,1284768000,"09 18, 2010",2010,1763,"['was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'much', 'Fixed', 'Point', 'Foundation', 'FPF', 'was', 'just', 'getting', 'complete', 'upset', 'delivered', 'byThe', 'God', 'Delusion', 'Debate', 'mind', 'debate', 'FPF', 'strongly', 'realm', 'neutrality', 'honest', 'inquiry', 'conversation', 'happened', 'God', 'Delusion', 'Debate', 'had', 'have', 'not', 'had', 'misfortune', 'watching', 'catastrophe', 'would', 'have', 'proclaimed', 'Has', 'Science', 'Buried', 'God', 'did', 'only', 'slightly', 'more', 'live', 'up', 'expectations', 'However', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'pleasant', 'surprise.Both', 'men', 'are', 'obviously', 'very', 'skilled', 'fields', 'science', 'mathematics', 'very', 'capable', 'explaining', 'stances', 'did', 'have', 'problem', 'Dawkins', 'not', 'following', 'up', 'traditional', 'rhetorical', 'fashion', 'believe', 'kept', 'conversation', 'too', 'civil', 'was', 'commentator', 'end', 'who', 'agreed', 'said', 'men', 'were', 'entirely', 'too', 'polite', 'Unfortunately', 'polite', 'less', 'revealing', 'Maybe', 'Dawkins', 'respect', 'Lennox', ""n't"", 'have', 'other', 'theologians', 'maybe', 'was', 'venue', 'being', 'prior', 'place', 'employment', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'valid', 'points', 'Dawkins', 'dropped', 'ball', 'liking', 'point', 'allowed', 'Lennox', 'save', 'face', 'jump', 'topics', 'seemed', 'weak', 'stance', 'side', ""'m"", 'Atheist', 'have', 'very', 'high', 'bar', 'Dawkins.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'side', 'can', 'credit', 'potential', 'faults', 'conversation', 'other', 'party', 'was', 'rather', 'unmoderated', 'FPF', 'did', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'end', 'participants', 'performed', 'fairly', 'well', 'even', 'was', 'nothing', 'truly', 'exceptional', 'new', 'even', 'gave', 'up', 'much', 'ground', 'lack', 'persistence', 'verbal', 'agility', 'other', 'member']",N/A

1268908,AF3EWORDT15AU,B002HS1GH4,John Grove,"[1, 5]","John Lennox seems like such a sweet old man, the kind you would want as a Grandpa but his arguments over and over are emotionally based and wishful. Richard Dawkins had to call him on this several times during the debate to which even John probably finally recognized at the end he was advancing a ""god of the gaps"" arguments.Richard Dawkins finds that science would be impossible to do if he thought miracles could be smuggled in by magic at any time. His contention is that the kind of thinking that John Lennox is putting forth would in effect halt science or at the minimum discourage it. In actuality we all can see the truth in this observation from the Intelligent Design crowd. For example Michael Behe has wrote that the flagellum is irruducibly complex meaning that we cannot understand its evolution therefore it must have been designed. When he was shown otherwise (overwhelmingly I must add) in Dover vs Kitzmiller did this change his mind? No, he merely points to something else that has yet been fully explained. This is the very opposite of science and this is what Richard tries to explain to John.John has trouble understanding the ramifications of evolution by natural selection to such a degree Richard has to ask him if he even accepts it. When he replied that he does Richard tries to explain that what Darwin has essentially given us is a parable on how we should look at things. The human body and the diversity was thought at one time to be so complex that it would have been ludicrous to say ""it just happened"". When Darwin solved this, which was the real difficult problem of the time it tells us that we should not be so ""hasty"" as to exclaim God did this or God did that, but we should suspend judgment and continue to do science to look for answers. Upon this, Lennox continues with his God of the gaps arguments to which I could sense Richard getting frustrated.When they both discussed morality and meaning Lennox resorts to the low blow of ""where do humans get their morality from"" as if he has never read anything by any secularist with regard to ethics. Sometimes when I hear over and over the same arguments which have in fact been debunked or at least responded to intelligently, it bothers me when it continues to be brought up as if John cannot understand, doesn't want to understand or flat doesn't care about the responses he has been given by secularists but seemingly wants to score points with the audience with another emotional appeal argument, unless John clearly does not grasp the arguments against his position which may be the case because I think John is sincere.The ""rational intelligibility of the universe"" argument that John advances, which he seems to belabor with sincerity is nothing more than an argument of ignorance. Near the end of the debate John Lennox essential says let us look at the world views and see which is more pleasing and comforting to us. Richard replies of course the Christian view is comforting but that doesn't make it true. That reminds me of when Christopher Hitchens told William Craig that he was ""willing to accept, on the basis of the evidence, conclusions that may be unwelcome to me"" and then adds, ""I'm sorry I have to spell that out to you"" indicating to Craig that his argument for morality was nothing more than ""wishful""Now, let me add that I like John Lennox. He seems a sweet guy. Sincere and more honest than William Craig which I found refreshing. Craig is kind of like a snake who will lie if he needs to, change positions if needed to score points in a debate and misrepresent and omit evidence which he plainly knows. John doesn't do this. He tries his best to make a case based on what he believes represents reality best. So, for that alone I respect him and he is a ""worthy opponent"".",5,It Appears That Science Has Buried God,1305849600,"05 20, 2011",2011,3789,"['John', 'Lennox', 'sweet', 'old', 'man', 'kind', 'would', 'want', 'Grandpa', 'arguments', 'are', 'emotionally', 'based', 'wishful', 'Richard', 'Dawkins', 'had', 'call', 'several', 'times', 'debate', 'even', 'John', 'probably', 'finally', 'recognized', 'end', 'was', 'advancing', 'god', 'gaps', 'arguments.Richard', 'Dawkins', 'science', 'would', 'be', 'impossible', 'do', 'thought', 'miracles', 'could', 'be', 'smuggled', 'magic', 'time', 'contention', 'kind', 'thinking', 'John', 'Lennox', 'putting', 'forth', 'would', 'effect', 'halt', 'science', 'minimum', 'discourage', 'actuality', 'can', 'see', 'truth', 'observation', 'Intelligent', 'Design', 'crowd', 'example', 'Michael', 'Behe', 'wrote', 'flagellum', 'irruducibly', 'complex', 'meaning', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'evolution', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'designed', 'When', 'was', 'shown', 'otherwise', 'overwhelmingly', 'must', 'add', 'Dover', 'vs', 'Kitzmiller', 'did', 'change', 'mind', 'No', 'merely', 'something', 'else', 'yet', 'been', 'fully', 'explained', 'very', 'opposite', 'science', 'what', 'Richard', 'explain', 'John.John', 'trouble', 'understanding', 'ramifications', 'evolution', 'natural', 'selection', 'degree', 'Richard', 'ask', 'even', 'When', 'replied', 'Richard', 'explain', 'what', 'Darwin', 'essentially', 'given', 'parable', 'how', 'should', 'look', 'things', 'human', 'body', 'diversity', 'was', 'thought', 'one', 'time', 'be', 'so', 'complex', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'ludicrous', 'say', 'just', 'happened', 'When', 'Darwin', 'solved', 'was', 'real', 'difficult', 'problem', 'time', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'so', 'hasty', 'exclaim', 'God', 'did', 'God', 'did', 'should', 'suspend', 'judgment', 'continue', 'do', 'science', 'look', 'answers', 'Lennox', 'God', 'gaps', 'arguments', 'could', 'sense', 'Richard', 'getting', 'frustrated.When', 'discussed', 'morality', 'meaning', 'Lennox', 'low', 'blow', 'where', 'do', 'humans', 'get', 'morality', 'never', 'read', 'anything', 'secularist', 'regard', 'ethics', 'Sometimes', 'when', 'hear', 'same', 'arguments', 'have', 'fact', 'been', 'debunked', 'least', 'responded', 'intelligently', 'when', 'be', 'brought', 'up', 'John', 'can', 'not', 'understand', ""n't"", 'want', 'understand', 'flat', ""n't"", 'care', 'responses', 'been', 'given', 'secularists', 'seemingly', 'score', 'points', 'audience', 'emotional', 'appeal', 'argument', 'John', 'clearly', 'not', 'grasp', 'arguments', 'position', 'may', 'be', 'case', 'think', 'John', 'sincere.The', 'rational', 'intelligibility', 'universe', 'argument', 'John', 'advances', 'belabor', 'sincerity', 'nothing', 'more', 'argument', 'ignorance', 'end', 'debate', 'John', 'Lennox', 'essential', 'let', 'look', 'world', 'views', 'see', 'more', 'pleasing', 'comforting', 'Richard', 'replies', 'course', 'Christian', 'view', 'comforting', ""n't"", 'make', 'true', 'when', 'Christopher', 'Hitchens', 'told', 'William', 'Craig', 'was', 'willing', 'accept', 'basis', 'evidence', 'conclusions', 'may', 'be', 'unwelcome', 'then', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'have', 'spell', 'out', 'indicating', 'Craig', 'argument', 'morality', 'was', 'nothing', 'more', 'wishful', 'Now', 'let', 'add', 'like', 'John', 'Lennox', 'sweet', 'guy', 'Sincere', 'more', 'honest', 'William', 'Craig', 'found', 'refreshing', 'Craig', 'kind', 'snake', 'who', 'will', 'lie', 'change', 'positions', 'needed', 'score', 'points', 'debate', 'misrepresent', 'omit', 'evidence', 'plainly', 'John', ""n't"", 'do', 'best', 'make', 'case', 'based', 'what', 'reality', 'best', 'So', 'alone', 'respect', 'worthy', 'opponent']",N/A
1268909,AFK9D6U1HKQER,B002HS1GH4,Konstantin,"[8, 18]","...well this video will not decide who winner is, but it is very informative, especially to those who has not been exposed to the subject in more depth.Here, two individuals from Oxford debate the issue of God's existence. One is evolutionary biologist and amateur philosopher (atheist Dawkins), and the other is mathematician and a philosopher (Lennox).One thing is clear from this conversation [it is more of a conversation format, then the formal debate], is the fact that it is NOT science that is the reason of division. it is a personal issue Dawkins has with Christian God, whom he calls 'petty'. If you listen, and listen to Dawkins [not in this video, but generally, whenever he makes pronunciations on the subject], you will see that he cannot comprehend how God could have visited poor and uneducated shepherds, peasants and such...God sent his Son for salvation of humanity - this is petty!God is not as complex as His creation is complex (i.e. consisting of parts) - this is petty!God is not deistic God (which Dawkins finds more appealing ??? can't see why? any God is simple anyways, deistic or theistic..) - this is petty!God did not evolve - this is extremely petty!!! (how can ANYTHING exist that has not evolved ?? what a petty!)On the other hand, it does not bother Dawkins that his naive just-so stories about:a) origin of life from non-living chemical compounds - first living organism/systemb) origin of a need and capability of that organism to reproduce (why do it anyways?)c) origin and nature of personal identity, which is not a property of a physical object or of any of its constituent parts, no matter how reassembledd) origin and nature of morality/conscience and why people feel obligated to be good...? (and even if they don't feel anything, is anything whatsoever is good or bad on the objective sense...)etc.One thing I caught very funny! Dawkins (as usual) complains ""why would God care what people do with their genitals?"" And OF COURSE he calls it .... petty! But why would he even bring this out, when there are plethora of things to discuss in this short hour or two? Does it resonate something personal?Oh well, why care what people do with their genitals? Let's just celebrate teacher led masturbation in preschool and teacher led orgies in college. Who cares what people do with their genitals?!Let's celebrate and endorse, man-boy live (aka pedophilia), incest, necrophilia, in addition to homosexuality...I mean, why did he even bring up such a pitiful line?Perhaps God cares about morality because we are moral creatures reflecting certain characteristics of God [personhood, and ability to discern morality among other things], and because morality is proceeding from God's very nature....In other words, I find this video interesting, if for no other reasons, just because Dawkins afraid to debate Christians, and having any debate (I only seen those with Lennox and McGrath), is at least so much entertaining. I guess Dawkins is Oxfordist [kind of a racist, who does not recognize anybody as equal except if they are from Oxford...] ;)Dawkins and Lennox had their chances to present their cases and evaluate worldviews of each other. I doubt this video will change your views, but it is informative, and recommended [oh wait, who is me to recommend anything. I am not from Oxford.

1268910,A1OR78ZN84VGDB,B002HS1GH4,rossuk,"[24, 34]","The format of the debate was in a rather more conversational format, rather than the more adversarial format in the ""God Delusion"" debate in Birmingham, Alabama, which made the debate better. Both Lennox and Dawkins are poles apart in their world views, and there is really no loser or winner. What I found interesting is that Dawkins really has no clue about Christianity, he does not understand anything about the death or resurrection of Jesus, or the justice of God, and yet he likes to pontificate about how bad religion is. If he wants to rail against God, that is up to him, but he should at least know something about his apponent, but he is clueless. He needs a 101 primer on Christianity, before he puts pen to paper. After all, I can see where he is coming from, as an atheist, but he has no clue about his Christian opponent. The best that he can do is to ridicule the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, which he calls ""petty"", and on the origin of the universe by a designer he calls ""magic"". I do not find that a strong argument, I could equally ridicule his theory of the origin of the universe by calling it ""happenstance"". The best quip by Dawkins was that there are only two views on the universe, one is that it is eternal the second is that it had a start, and the bible got it right, a 1 in 2 chance. This is the argument by ridicule again, I could respond by saying that there is a 1 in 2 chance of getting God right and Dawkins got it wrong.Dawkins uses the ""who created God"" argument, which is an infinite regress, and he quite happily believes in the multiverse argument to explain the anthropic principle, which is not provable by science, it is metaphysics. Now Lennox is not the best apologist there is, but he fights his corner well. I can empathise with both sides of the debate but really to me there were no winners or losers. Has science buried God? The debate did not answer that question. In science, God keeps on popping up, all very annoying for atheists (anthropic principle, information in DNA, the start of the universe, origin for the laws of physics, origin of life etc). Dawkins expects a naturalistic explanation, an act of faith, I believe, time will tell. I agree with Dawkins that we need more Darwin's and more Newton's, who can think outside the box. Will modern science allow that, no. All in all, a fascinating debate and well worth getting by both sides.Dawkins, as ""the"" leader of the ""New Atheists"". I expected better arguments.Also worth getting is theThe God Delusion Debateheld in Birmingham Alabama (also Dawkins vs Lennox).For more background see Dawkins and Lennox's booksThe God DelusionandGod's Undertaker: Has Science Buried God?",4,"A fascinating debate, but I was shocked at Dawkins lack of understanding about Christianity",1286668800,"10 10, 2010",2010,2697,"['format', 'debate', 'was', 'rather', 'more', 'conversational', 'format', 'rather', 'more', 'adversarial', 'format', 'God', 'Delusion', 'debate', 'Birmingham', 'Alabama', 'made', 'debate', 'better', 'Lennox', 'Dawkins', 'are', 'poles', 'apart', 'world', 'views', 'really', 'loser', 'winner', 'What', 'found', 'interesting', 'Dawkins', 'really', 'clue', 'Christianity', 'not', 'understand', 'anything', 'death', 'resurrection', 'Jesus', 'justice', 'God', 'yet', 'pontificate', 'how', 'bad', 'religion', 'rail', 'God', 'up', 'should', 'least', 'know', 'something', 'apponent', 'clueless', '101', 'primer', 'Christianity', 'pen', 'paper', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'coming', 'atheist', 'clue', 'Christian', 'opponent', 'best', 'can', 'do', 'ridicule', 'death', 'resurrection', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'petty', 'origin', 'universe', 'designer', 'magic', 'do', 'not', 'find', 'strong', 'argument', 'could', 'equally', 'ridicule', 'theory', 'origin', 'universe', 'calling', 'happenstance', 'best', 'quip', 'Dawkins', 'was', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'views', 'universe', 'one', 'eternal', 'second', 'had', 'start', 'bible', 'got', 'right', '1', '2', 'chance', 'argument', 'ridicule', 'again', 'could', 'respond', 'saying', '1', '2', 'chance', 'getting', 'God', 'right', 'Dawkins', 'got', 'who', 'created', 'God', 'argument', 'infinite', 'regress', 'quite', 'happily', 'multiverse', 'argument', 'explain', 'anthropic', 'principle', 'not', 'provable', 'science', 'metaphysics', 'Now', 'Lennox', 'not', 'best', 'apologist', 'corner', 'well', 'can', 'empathise', 'sides', 'debate', 'really', 'were', 'winners', 'losers', 'Has', 'science', 'buried', 'God', 'debate', 'did', 'not', 'answer', 'question', 'science', 'God', 'popping', 'up', 'very', 'annoying', 'atheists', 'anthropic', 'principle', 'information', 'DNA', 'start', 'universe', 'origin', 'laws', 'physics', 'origin', 'life', 'etc', 'naturalistic', 'explanation', 'act', 'faith', 'believe', 'time', 'will', 'tell', 'agree', 'Dawkins', 'need', 'more', 'Darwin', 'more', 'Newton', 'who', 'can', 'think', 'box', 'Will', 'modern', 'science', 'allow', 'fascinating', 'debate', 'well', 'getting', 'sides.Dawkins', 'leader', 'New', 'Atheists', 'expected', 'better', 'arguments.Also', 'worth', 'getting', 'theThe', 'God', 'Delusion', 'Debateheld', 'Birmingham', 'Alabama', 'also', 'vs', 'Lennox', '.For', 'more', 'background', 'see', 'Dawkins', 'Lennox', 'booksThe', 'God', 'DelusionandGod', 'Undertaker', 'Has', 'Science', 'Buried', 'God']",N/A
