Still, if you call it ""His Best Stuff To Date,"" I guess I'll agree.Of course ""Seven Words You Can't Say on TV"" is there, also dated. After all, once we had cable TV, all censorship was basically a thing relegated to the irrelevant broadcast band. Still, this is not just a rant about censorship, this is high-grade comedy. George goes into detail about most of the words, subjects them to a linguistic analysis that will have you in stitches.""Stuff"" is so true it's amazing he manages to make it funny as well, but that's essential Carlin: he can put just that little twist on it that forces you to laugh. The underlying serious message -- that we have too much stuff, care too much about our stuff, and can be considered highly materialistic -- goes down like medicine with a spoonful of sugar.""Baseball and Football"" relies heavily on his exquisite ability with sound effects and rapid-fire delivery, as well as a consistent voice management: one when describing football that sounds like what football is, and another when describing baseball that is equally fitting. Again, the observations reveal some important things about those who love these sports.""Dogs and Cats"" does far more than get us laughing hysterically at his imitations, although it definitely does that. His observations about the two animals and the people who love them are simply priceless.There's much more, but you get the idea. It really is a collection of the best he had done as of 1996.",4,"I Love George Carlin, But His Best Stuff Was After This Was Made",1336953600,"05 14, 2012",2012,1592,"['love', 'George', 'Carlin', 'Therefore', 'can', 'say', 'categorically', 'NOT', 'best', 'stuff', 'very', 'best', 'stuff', 'was', 'done', '1996', 'Still', 'call', 'Best', 'Stuff', 'Date', 'guess', ""'ll"", 'agree.Of', 'course', 'Seven', 'Words', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Say', 'TV', 'there', 'also', 'dated', 'once', 'had', 'cable', 'TV', 'censorship', 'was', 'basically', 'thing', 'relegated', 'irrelevant', 'broadcast', 'band', 'Still', 'not', 'just', 'rant', 'censorship', 'high-grade', 'comedy', 'George', 'detail', 'most', 'words', 'linguistic', 'analysis', 'will', 'have', 'stitches', 'Stuff', 'so', 'true', 'amazing', 'make', 'funny', 'as', 'well', 'essential', 'Carlin', 'can', 'put', 'just', 'little', 'twist', 'laugh', 'underlying', 'serious', 'message', 'have', 'too', 'much', 'stuff', 'care', 'too', 'much', 'stuff', 'can', 'be', 'considered', 'highly', 'materialistic', 'down', 'like', 'medicine', 'spoonful', 'sugar', 'Baseball', 'Football', 'heavily', 'exquisite', 'ability', 'sound', 'effects', 'rapid-fire', 'delivery', 'as', 'well', 'consistent', 'voice', 'management', 'one', 'when', 'describing', 'football', 'what', 'football', 'when', 'describing', 'baseball', 'equally', 'fitting', 'Again', 'observations', 'reveal', 'important', 'things', 'who', 'love', 'sports', 'Dogs', 'Cats', 'far', 'more', 'get', 'laughing', 'hysterically', 'imitations', 'definitely', 'observations', 'two', 'animals', 'people', 'who', 'love', 'are', 'simply', 'priceless.There', 'much', 'more', 'get', 'idea', 'really', 'collection', 'best', 'had', 'done', '1996']",George Carlin - George's Best Stuff VHS

We regarded him as being quite risqu&eacute; (lol) but today, I must admit, his brand of humor seems rather dated. What we have to remember with Carlin is that he was a forerunner, and this DVD really makes you realize the type of influence he had on the great comedians of our day--particularly Jerry Seinfeld. He was a giant of the observational method, and laid the ground upon which many a great career has traversed. Carlin's delivery is also magnificent. His acting and presence made him transcend what seems to be so-so material.

I've read a lot of reviews of Carlin since I discovered him the other day, and I've noticed that the people who worship him seem as a general rule to like violence in their &quot;music&quot; and their movies.  (I've been reading other reviews by Carlin devotees.)  I've also noticed that many if not most of the rave reviews (particularly one that praised his intelligence) are illiterate.  A few reviews I agree with.  Early, young Carlin was warmer, calmer, more human, more humane and just plain funnier.  The comparison can be made on this DVD, because the last bit &quot;Driving&quot; was by an older Carlin.  What were previously comical expressions on his face became grotesque manic grimaces, what was sly and warm became ferocious rage, what was controversial (and I get this also from the Jammin'/Doin' It DVD which I watched part of) became meaningless rantings.  His early stuff was amusing (I prefer Bob Newhart) and I laughed some, it was not particularly insightful, some of his observations of life and things (eg the differences between dogs and cats, stuff, losing things) were clever and often dead-on.  I obviously preferred the younger Carlin (and he was pretty then with all his hair, the older version simply didn't even look like him, whichever was the real him), and I thought the older Carlin was just an explosion of incoherent hatred.

Carlin has done NUMEROUS bits that are now deemed classic, and personally I think almost everything the man does, is great.  And yet, here is this DVD,  ""George's Best Stuff.""  Well, it is a start, but only covers SOME of the great things this very funny and unique man has said and done.It's not a complete disappointment though.  The bits and segments included are indeed funny.  And, I love how a lot of the stuff included are from older shows and acts.  I really do think Carlin shines the best in his older material, but the Carlin today is still very funny and on top of his game.  It was nice to see some of these older bits from older shows, and I hope they come out on DVD sometime soon.The DVD includes famous bits such as ""Seven Dirty Words,"" ""Stuff,"" ""Al Sleet,"" ""Dog Incident,"" ""Fussy Eater,"" ""Losing Things,"" ""Driving,"" and much more.  The DVD has a total of 17 chapters and adds up to the DVD being 87 minutes.AH HA!  There lies the problem.  87 minutes.  ONLY 87 minutes??  87 minutes for something with the title of ""George's Best Stuff?""  These 87 minutes should represent the entire comedy life of George Carlin?  I hope not!  Like I said, it's a nice start, but I think something of this magnitude should really be longer.  There's so much that is left out on this DVD.  So many classic bits that fail to appear on this package with the name ""George's Best Stuff.""  The stuff that is included does indeed qualify as some of George's best bits, but I think there was a missed opportunity here.  I really think more could've been done.Is ""George's Best Stuff"" a complete disappointment?  Of course not.  Is it enjoyable to watch?  Most definitely.  Should Carlin fans check it out?  By all means, yes.  However, I really do believe more could've been done and that more could've been included.  While ""George's Best Stuff"" isn't a total disappointment, it does leave you feeling that more could've and should've been done to honor the very title on the DVD cover, ""George's Best Stuff.""
