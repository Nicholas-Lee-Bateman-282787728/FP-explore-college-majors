1239494,A1MM3MDVZCYIBG,B001US3XV4,Andrew Ingram,"[5, 5]","First, I stumbled upon Karin by accident.  I wasn't expecting to like it simply because I didn't really care for the Vampire premise that it was based on, and I had already been vampired out by a series called ""Moonphase"" (which is also good in its own way).This story takes its own angle to tell a story about a teenager who isn't really a vampire, but an anti-vampire (blood-giver not sucker).  The style of the series reminded me of the Addams Family in the daughter's point of view (The daughter as in the Addam's Family's daughter)  In ""Karin's"" point of view she is not like the rest of her family -a black sheep of the family.  As she, a normal teenager, finds interest in a mysterious transfer student things become quite interesting as she has to deal with what any other teen goes through- the challenges of romantic relationships.If there is one thing that the Japanese artists are best at, it's being able to convey the human emotions and realistic human situations both light-hearted and fun, and heavy-hearted and heartbreaking.  I have yet to find an animation done anywhere else that is able to convey that kind of energy so easily.Anyways, Karin is a great story and well animated and definitely worth holding on to.",5,Karin,1271721600,"04 20, 2010",2010,1233,"['First', 'stumbled', 'Karin', 'accident', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'like', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'Vampire', 'premise', 'was', 'based', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'vampired', 'out', 'series', 'called', 'Moonphase', 'also', 'good', 'own', 'way', 'story', 'own', 'angle', 'tell', 'story', 'teenager', 'who', ""n't"", 'really', 'vampire', 'anti-vampire', 'blood-giver', 'not', 'sucker', 'style', 'series', 'reminded', 'Addams', 'Family', 'daughter', 'point', 'view', 'daughter', 'Addam', 'Family', 'daughter', 'Karin', 'point', 'view', 'not', 'rest', 'family', '-a', 'black', 'sheep', 'family', 'normal', 'teenager', 'interest', 'mysterious', 'transfer', 'student', 'things', 'become', 'quite', 'interesting', 'deal', 'what', 'other', 'teen', 'through-', 'challenges', 'romantic', 'relationships.If', 'one', 'thing', 'Japanese', 'artists', 'are', 'best', 'being', 'able', 'convey', 'human', 'emotions', 'realistic', 'human', 'situations', 'light-hearted', 'fun', 'heavy-hearted', 'heartbreaking', 'have', 'yet', 'find', 'animation', 'done', 'anywhere', 'else', 'able', 'convey', 'kind', 'energy', 'so', 'easily.Anyways', 'Karin', 'great', 'story', 'well', 'animated', 'definitely', 'worth', 'holding']",Karin: The Complete Series

It is filled with slapstick comedy, dysfunctional yet loving families, and touches interesting topics. While the side characters are both comical and endearing, I loved seeing the relationship between Karin and Kenta grow from her trying desperately to avoid him---to the incredibly strong friendship in which both trust each other and confide in each other---to finally realizing they're in love...and what that would mean for a vampire (or 'un-vampire') and a human.Overall I enjoyed this series entirely, and if you want a very good laugh, some sweet romance, and a little dash of the supernatural...give this a try :)",5,Funny and Endearing,1277078400,"06 21, 2010",2010,786,"['bought', 'Karin', 'reservations', 'first', 'episode', 'made', 'little', 'wary', 'was', 'just', 'going', 'be', 'extremely', 'stupid', 'anime', 'grew', 'rapidly', 'filled', 'slapstick', 'comedy', 'dysfunctional', 'yet', 'loving', 'families', 'touches', 'interesting', 'topics', 'side', 'characters', 'are', 'comical', 'endearing', 'loved', 'seeing', 'relationship', 'Karin', 'Kenta', 'grow', 'trying', 'desperately', 'avoid', '-to', 'incredibly', 'strong', 'friendship', 'trust', 'other', 'confide', 'other', '-to', 'finally', 'realizing', ""'re"", 'love', 'what', 'would', 'mean', 'vampire', ""'un-vampire"", 'human.Overall', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'entirely', 'want', 'very', 'good', 'laugh', 'sweet', 'romance', 'little', 'dash', 'supernatural', 'give', 'try']",Karin: The Complete Series
1239496,A3HP7JU4ZORF52,B001US3XV4,Anja Rebekka Schultze,"[0, 0]","Karin is about a young high school girl who happens to be a vampire, however unlike other vampires Karin is an un vampire, her body produces to much blood and she have to pump it into someone or she will get massive nose bleeds. Also vampires in this setting have one type of human they like to feed on, this includes Karin, who is attracted to misery, so when she meets a boy who live with his poor mother and who have more than a few problems of his own Karin decides to make him a lunch box every day at school to cheer him up so she would not get nosebleeds around him all the time. Unfortunately it do not always work and the young boy, Kenta Usui discovers Karins secret, her family, who off course are vampires, charge the young man to be their daughter's protector. What follows is a cute romantic comedy story with characters good enough that the viewer really hope things will go well for them.Now this anime is half episodic, some sort of problem arises with Karin, her vampire family, Kenta, or one of her school friends, which includes a vampire hunter, the problem get solved and the episode ends, but there is also a overarching storyline. Another nice thing about Karin is that the anime actually have an end, there is a climax and a satisfying ending to the show, a feature which many animes lack.Karin is a very sweet an innocent show and I would have no qualms about letting a little girl watch it, also the fact that Karin is living a normal life, and have a family who are rather normal despite being vampires so you get the mix of the mundane and the creepy should be appealing to anyone who likes things the Addams Family and the Munsters or for younger generations Gravedale High or Monster High. There is no nudity here, and except for a very few scenes there is no violence.Karin take the concept of vampires and make a pleasing twist to it. There are many vampire animes, both in the horror and the romance genre but Karin is very different, if you have seen allot of vampire animes and is looking for something new, or if you are tired of vampires all together then Karin might still catch your interest, and for huge vampire fans Karin is so cute and out of the ordinary that it is impossible not to love the show. Also if you think Karin is only for children think again, yes it would be a good show for kids, but I am an adult and I adore it. I think Karin is one of those shows which is suited for all ages.The animation of Karin is very good, the colors are vibrant and the artistic style is very suited to the show. As for music it is not bad at all, but it is not very memorable either, however generally Karin is great technically. The only real complaint I have about Karin is that there are a few details which are not explained in the anime, such as the nature of Anju's (Karin's little sister) talking doll, you need to read the manga to get what is up with him. However generally this show have not fallen into the common trap of relaying on that viewers have read the manga, there are a few slip ups, like with the doll, but for the most part Karin is self contained and one can definitely enjoy it without having read the manga.In conclusion Karin is a brilliant anime, it is fun and heath warming and just creepy enough to be interesting, it is a fresh breath to the vampire genre and I wholeheartedly recommend it, I think it might be the anime series I enjoyed most last year.

1239497,A33WAXM7XI8DQN,B001US3XV4,"A. Sessler ""AniMason""","[1, 1]","Karin is a romantic comedy and in turn should be judged as such. Although the common pretty girl= nose bleed anime formula is used in this series, Karin did a good job at adjusting it for its own appeal. In this case Karin, the female lead, was the one getting nose bleeds. Not only because of the male lead, but also because of her being an un-vampire.Essentially, for Karin's vampire lore, vampires only feed on a type of blood relating to an emotion when they peak/need to feed. In Karin's case when she peaks, she gets a nose bleed. The story pretty much revolves around this design. As well as Usui, the boy who knows of Karin's secret and, their growing relationship. Aside from the addition of several useless characters, mainly a van hellsing type, any action in this series is used to heighten romantic bits.The animation style complimented the characters well, the English cast was a good fit, and although the soundtrack was a little lacking at times, what bits there were sounded alright.

1239501,A26TY6GCGBF5HT,B001US3XV4,Graves,"[0, 0]","Based loosely on the manga ""Chibi-vampire"" Karin follows the adventures of a Japanese high school girl who happens to be a Vampire, hiding her existence while trying to be a normal girl.Far from being some Goth horror show Karin is light and airy. She is the most innocuous of vampires who keeps an after school job, shops with friends, fears her parents don't understand her and handles a first love.The first two episodes seem to follow the manga closely but this is only to set the scene for the anime. From there it strikes off on its own story line most closely marked by the appearance of Winter, a way over the top vampire hunter who is in love with her and who is so clueless as to her nature that he makes Elmer Fudd look like a cold killer.If Karin has a flaw it is pleasant, but aimless. It is not a romantic comedy, or a magical girl plot or even a coming of age story. There is no grand theme other than Karin living her life. In the long run this leaves the viewer unfulfilled.I'm tempted to say this is an entertaining anime for children whose parents are sick of battling robot and pet pocket monsters, since these are normal teens with little in the way of sex or violence but that endorsement has to come with the warning that there are some scenes of bloodshed and the very rare vampire dripping with blood.

Instead of sucking blood when she gets near her a person with her preferred blood type, Karin produces blood. Mostly it gushes from her nose. She actually can give her extra blood to humans and it gives them a positive experience. She meets a boy in school, Usui, who she develops a crush for. She wants to get close to him and have a relationship, but when she gets too excited around him she bleeds through her nose profusely.This anime has a very fun and playful vibe. The characters and situations are funny and very entertaining. It's almost your typical high school romance/comedy. The Un-Vampire twist makes it quite different. My only complaint with this anime is the production quality. The animation isn't very detailed, and a little bit blurry. Especially in the character outlines. I do like the character designs and coloration though. My other issue is the bad voice acting. Most of the characters sound stoned or drunk. It takes a lot away from the series. I've listened to the English and Japanese tracks. They are both kinda bad. If you can deal with the sub par animation and bad voice acting, this series has a fun story.

1239506,AHF97M45JFCB,B001US3XV4,ONENEO,"[16, 16]","Karin is one of those unmistakably quirky but loveable Geneon properties that many anime fans (such as myself) feared would go down with the ship.  Fortunately, Funimation has been diligent in their efforts of tossing out the lifeboats for countless such titles by re-releasing them to the North American market in all their original glory.Released across 6 DVDs, the Funimation version of Karin consists of three thin packs (each containing two discs) within a tasteful cardboard slipcase.  The show comes in at a 580-minute runtime and wears a fairly conservative 13+ rating.  There is no real nudity to report (save for some covered-up body models in the opening) and the language is friendly to viewers of all ages.  Sure there are a few juvenilely creepy vampire moments, but in all, this is definitely a title that will charm members of all age demographics.The story goes something like this: Karin Maaka may seem like a perfectly normal teeny-bopper/ high school student with all of the usual dilemmas to keep her occupied: Dating, zits, anemia and the desire to bite into people's necks.Sure that last one isn't that uncommon among the teenage set, keep in mind that our title character is in fact the middle child in a family of futuristic vampires who've made Japan their home.As if being a vampire wasn't enough, Karin is a reverse vampire (or an ""un-vampire"" as the case may be).  This means that she doesn't rely upon sucking the blood of others to live but rather makes her own supply just like the rest of us.  Before you start to wonder if you are in fact a vampire as well, her condition is unique in that she makes too much of the red-stuff and has to bite others to get rid of some of her own.Here's the catch, Karin literally has to get rid of her excess corpuscles or risk volatile nose-bleeds as her body rids itself of the extra blood.  The good news is that her victims don't suffer from the bite/ injection but actually feel revitalized and refreshed (a trick that I'm forced to reply upon Red Bull to duplicate).Another interesting facet of her ""condition"" is that the mood of those surrounding her has a distinct effect on her body's blood affinity.  In other words, Karin's body starts working in overdrive in blood production when she's around miserable people (good thing she doesn't live around here).  As such, the poor girl is often found doing all she can to try to better the moods of those around her.Following in the footsteps of such classic shows as The Addam's Family or The Munsters, a lot of Karin's appeal comes from the fact that her family life is, for all facts and circumstances, surprisingly normal.  Karin shares room and board with a brother, Ren and sister Anju with some fairly stereotypical parents (think protective father and quick-to-butt-in mother).While her family may play the more traditional vampire role, Karin herself (don't forget she is an un-vampire) lacks some of the typical traits such as vulnerability to sunlight, night vision, and the ability to erase memories.  Yes she has the fangs but that only inhibits her on class-picture day.The show itself just plain works, partially because Karin is a lovable lead character and partially because the whole vampire angle adds a nice element of mystery to the typical high-school comedy genre.The show is as much High School Musical as it is Twilight and that's not a bad thing.  The heavy load of hiding the fact that she and hers are technically members of the ""living dead"", teen romance, high school shenanigans, and a whole lot of coming of age in the modern world spruces things up.Perhaps its greatest strength is how tastefully and humorously the context manages to parallel Karin's unique blood dilemma to the budding menstrual cycles of all girls of similar age.  As such many of the situations and tense moments have an inherent scale of relatability and realism.Karin's biggest weakness comes in the form of the art and animation, which isn't anything spectacular.  Not that either actually take away from a viewer's ability to enjoy the smooth pacing and just plain fun prose, the backgrounds and character models are nothing spectacular either.  The fan-service that managed to cause a bit of a reputation in the manga source-material has pretty much been eliminated entirely in the transition to anime (again except for the opening sequence, which hints toward much more risqu&eacute; material than the show ever delivers).The sound track is a mixed bag as well with upbeat pop numbers and smooth instrumentals that perfectly accent the teeny-theme of the show but the English dub isn't one of the strongest out there.  Like the visuals, the dub work is passable but not quite the butter-smooth masterwork that is so common with Funimation properties.In all, this is a fun show that manages to capture the small moments of teenage life and blend them with a fictional backdrop nearly perfectly.  Because the writers initially decided to add a unique twist on the vampire theme, Karin ends up being one of those rare shows that will hold viewer interest regardless of their personal genre tastes.  The humor works and the drama never becomes so heavy that it drags the well-constructed prose down.",3,Chipper Anime For Viewers of all Tastes,1243382400,"05 27, 2009",2009,5227,"['Karin', 'one',

The two main characters Karin Maaka the oldest daughter to a vampire family who has a rather unique condition that puts her apart from regular vampires and  Kenta Usui a high school student who's the love interest of Karin stumbles upon her secret.  The series has some dramatic scenes but nothing to dark like Hellsing it's mostly a light-hearted romantic anime.  Sadly this reminded me a lot of the other vampire series Moonphase and when compared to each other Moonphase wins hands down against this series,  The one thing they seem to put a lot with this series is a great deal of fan service which in my opinion wasn't really needed but I guess that the producers felt it was necessary for this show.  Another great let down was the dubbed voice actors they got for this series,  the Japanese voice cast were great and played their roles superbly,  sadly I can't say the same for the English voice cast the got which were either mediocre to down right horrible.  At the end and for the price it's not a bad box set to get but I'd advise watching this series subbed because otherwise be prepared to get a pretty bad headache trying to listen to these horrendous dubbed voice actors trying their roles...",3,A Somewhat Entertaining Series But Moonphase Surpasses This Fan Service Anime,1240704000,"04 26, 2009",2009,1324,"['series', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'great', 'just', 'gray', 'shade', 'watchable', 'many', 'complaints', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'Karin', 'Maaka', 'oldest', 'daughter', 'vampire', 'family', 'who', 'rather', 'unique', 'condition', 'apart', 'regular', 'vampires', 'Kenta', 'Usui', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'who', 'love', 'interest', 'Karin', 'stumbles', 'secret', 'series', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'nothing', 'dark', 'Hellsing', 'mostly', 'light-hearted', 'romantic', 'anime', 'Sadly', 'reminded', 'lot', 'other', 'vampire', 'series', 'Moonphase', 'when', 'compared', 'other', 'Moonphase', 'hands', 'down', 'series', 'one', 'thing', 'seem', 'put', 'lot', 'series', 'great', 'deal', 'fan', 'service', 'opinion', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'needed', 'guess', 'producers', 'felt', 'was', 'necessary', 'show', 'great', 'let', 'down', 'was', 'dubbed', 'voice', 'actors', 'got', 'series', 'Japanese', 'voice', 'cast', 'were', 'great', 'played', 'roles', 'superbly', 'sadly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'same', 'English', 'voice', 'cast', 'got', 'were', 'either', 'mediocre', 'down', 'right', 'horrible', 'end', 'price', 'not', 'bad', 'box', 'set', 'get', ""'d"", 'advise', 'watching', 'series', 'subbed', 'otherwise', 'be', 'prepared', 'get', 'pretty', 'bad', 'headache', 'trying', 'listen', 'horrendous', 'dubbed', 'voice', 'actors', 'trying', 'roles']",Karin: The Complete Series
1239508,AA4AU17N2DGOY,B001US3XV4,"Steven Redding ""Steve R""","[18, 21]","I first began collecting the Karin Series last year when it was released by Geneon after the third volume it was gone. Gone! and all the trades said it was gone for good! Off into a vast anime oblivion, discontinued due to a failed distribution company. Thankfully My Personal Heroes at Funimation Entertainment caught the rights to distribute Karin and other Geneon Niche titles to the US and Canada.Well enough of the history lesson. This anime is truly a great piece of art, and No I don't believe I'm overstating it either. The Original Manga by Yuna Kagesaki differs somewhat from the anime namely the anime could not be an exact expression of Manga-ka Kagesaki's vision it had to be cut down to fit into a 25 episode series, and ""work for TV"". The Manga covers over 13 volumes of text and art. (avilable fom Tokyopop under the title Chibi Vampire) originaly published in ""Monthly Dragon Magazine"" and ""Monthly Comic Dragon"" in Japan. The animation was done by JC Staff known for fanservice, but, though evident, it is toned way down in the this series. The now defunct Odex of singapore produced the English dub. The English version was written and directed at Odex by American voice artist and puppetteer. Mr. Paul Pistore. Who's script provided a very fluid dialect in English, which in my opinion captured the original writers intent fully. I have shaired many e-mails with Mr. Pistore regarding his work on Karin and other more recent projects. The main cast besides Mr. Pistore consists of Ms. Chelsea Curto as Karin Marker, and Mr. Yahav Rom as Kenta Usui. Both are excelent matches for their respective charicters, along with Mr. Pistore and the balance of the cast, well they should all be recognized for their work.Karin is a very emotional story of unexpected love between classmates Kenta Usui, the new transfer student from the north with funny eyes, and Karin Marker, a popular, yet youthfully awkward child of immigrant parents who has lived her life in Japan as a native aparently since early childhood.Here's one of the hooks, Karen is a vampire. Or rather her situation is being an outsider in her own family. Instead of sucking or rather drinking human blood Karin's body overproduces blood which she must either inject into a ""victim"" or she suffers painful and profuse nose bleeds, this qualifies her as an un-vampire.""Look for a more friendly vampire mythos in Karin, it's not the same old Dracula, Twilight, Forever Knight, Ann Rice, stuff. It's much more... Friendly, as I said, and Karinesque vampires are more like a subspecies of human than the usual 'undead bloodsucker mythos' which we've all seen before.""Considering this is a vampire title I was astounded to see the morality that each charicter shows. Kenta Usui dreams of working hard and being a good citizen and a family man. Karin also works hard like Kenta is genuenly a moral person, her family, though vampiric is a traditional nuclear family, and despite family disputes they all appear in their own way to love and support Karin. There really are no villans, only people with different perspectives.One interisting thing is that Kenta is not bound to Karin by some spell, curse, transdimentional warp, Renfield like devotion, or any other anime cliche' devise, as I would have expected. His bond to Karin Grows out of his and her personalities, and his desire to be friendly and a good man.  Karin's situation is a little more camplex. She feels uneasy near Kenta and has nose bleeds, she cheers herself, and himself up by making him a bento lunch, daily! As time goes by, boy and girl together, well you know.I think Love would have come to the couple sooner if they weren't constantly interupted by, Vampire hunters, classmates, and Karin's family attempting to stop their budding relationship.This anime is also very much about acceptance. When Kenta finds out about Karin's vampiric heritage, he does not freak out, he accepts her as she is. Later Karin's friends find out her secret and they accept her. Even the supposed villians accept her, and eventualy Karin's family accepts Kenta, except for her father Henry Marker (voiced by Paul Pistore) who is stereotypicaly overprotective of his teenage daughter.I think of this series and it makes me smile. It works as a shonen and as a shojo title. It's so darn emotional and downright sweet, you'll have to brush your teeth/fangs afterwards, or you'll get cavities.",5,Thank You Funimation Entertainment,1237766400,"03 23, 2009",2009,4415,"['first', 'began', 'collecting', 'Karin', 'Series', 'last', 'year', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'Geneon', 'third', 'volume', 'was', 'gone', 'Gone', 'trades', 'said', 'was', 'gone', 'good', 'Off', 'vast', 'anime', 'oblivion', 'discontinued', 'due', 'failed', 'distribution', 'company', 'Thankfully', 'My', 'Personal', 'Heroes', 'Funimation', 'Entertainment', 'caught', 'rights', 'distribute', 'Karin', 'other', 'Geneon', 'Niche', 'titles', 'US', 'Canada.Well', 'enough', 'history', 'lesson', 'anime', 'truly', 'great', 'piece', 'art', 'No', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', ""'m"", 'overstating', 'Original', 'Manga', 'Yuna', 'Kagesaki', 'differs', 'somewhat', 'anime', 'namely', 'anime', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'exact', 'expression', 'Manga-ka', 'Kagesaki', 'vision', 'had', 'be', 'cut', 'down', 'fit', '25', 'episode', 'series', 'work', 'TV', 'Manga', '13', 'volumes', 'text', 'art', 'avilable', 'fom', 'Tokyopop', 'title', 'Chibi', 'Vampire', 'originaly', 'published', 'Monthly', 'Dragon', 'Magazine', 'Monthly', 'Comic', 'Dragon', 'Japan', 'animation', 'was', 'done', 'JC', 'Staff', 'known', 'fanservice', 'though', 'evident', 'toned', 'way', 'down', 'series', 'now', 'defunct', 'Odex', 'singapore', 'produced', 'English', 'dub', 'English', 'version', 'was', 'written', 'directed', 'Odex', 'American', 'voice', 'artist', 'puppetteer', 'Mr.', 'Paul', 'Pistore', 'Who', 'script', 'provided', 'very', 'fluid', 'dialect', 'English', 'opinion', 'captured', 'original', 'writers', 'intent', 'fully', 'have', 'shaired', 'many', 'e-mails', 'Mr.', 'Pistore', 'regarding', 'work', 'Karin', 'other', 'more', 'recent', 'projects', 'main', 'cast', 'Mr.', 'Pistore', 'Ms.', 'Chelsea', 'Curto', 'Karin', 'Marker', 'Mr.', 'Yahav', 'Rom', 'Kenta', 'Usui', 'are', 'excelent', 'matches', 'respective', 'charicters', 'Mr.', 'Pistore', 'balance', 'cast', 'well', 'should', 'be', 'recognized', 'work.Karin', 'very', 'emotional', 'story', 'unexpected', 'love', 'classmates', 'Kenta', 'Usui', 'new', 'transfer', 'student', 'north', 'funny', 'eyes', 'Karin', 'Marker', 'popular', 'yet', 'youthfully', 'awkward', 'child', 'immigrant', 'parents', 'who', 'lived', 'life', 'Japan', 'native', 'aparently', 'early', 'one', 'hooks', 'Karen', 'vampire', 'rather', 'situation', 'being', 'outsider', 'own', 'family', 'Instead', 'sucking', 'rather', 'drinking', 'human', 'blood', 'Karin', 'body', 'overproduces', 'blood', 'must', 'either', 'inject', 'victim', 'painful', 'profuse', 'nose', 'bleeds', 'un-vampire', 'Look', 'more', 'friendly', 'vampire', 'mythos', 'Karin', 'not', 'same', 'old', 'Dracula', 'Twilight', 'Forever', 'Knight', 'Ann', 'Rice', 'stuff', 'much', 'more', 'Friendly', 'said', 'Karinesque', 'vampires', 'are', 'more', 'subspecies', 'human', 'usual', 'bloodsucker', 'mythos', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Considering', 'vampire', 'title', 'was', 'astounded', 'see', 'morality', 'charicter', 'Kenta', 'Usui', 'dreams', 'working', 'hard', 'being', 'good', 'citizen', 'family', 'man', 'Karin', 'also', 'hard', 'Kenta', 'genuenly', 'moral', 'person', 'family', 'vampiric', 'traditional', 'nuclear', 'family', 'family', 'disputes', 'appear', 'own', 'way', 'love', 'support', 'Karin', 'really', 'are', 'villans', 'only', 'people', 'different', 'perspectives.One', 'interisting', 'thing', 'Kenta', 'not', 'bound', 'Karin', 'spell', 'curse', 'transdimentional', 'warp', 'Renfield', 'devotion', 'other', 'anime', 'cliche', 'devise', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'bond', 'Karin', 'Grows', 'personalities', 'desire', 'be', 'friendly', 'good', 'man', 'Karin', 'situation', 'little', 'more', 'camplex', 'uneasy', 'Kenta', 'nose', 'bleeds', 'up', 'making', 'bento', 'lunch', 'daily', 'time', 'boy', 'girl', 'together', 'well', 'know.I', 'think', 'Love', 'would', 'have', 'come', 'couple', 'sooner', 'were', ""n't"", 'constantly', 'interupted', 'Vampire', 'hunters', 'classmates', 'Karin', 'family', 'attempting', 'stop', 'budding', 'relationship.This', 'anime', 'also', 'very', 'much', 'acceptance', 'When', 'Kenta', 'out', 'Karin', 'vampiric', 'heritage', 'not', 'freak', 'out', 'Later', 'Karin', 'friends', 'find', 'out', 'secret', 'accept', 'Even', 'supposed', 'villians', 'Karin', 'family', 'Kenta', 'father', 'Henry', 'Marker', 'voiced', 'Paul', 'Pistore', 'who', 'stereotypicaly', 'overprotective', 'teenage', 'daughter.I', 'think', 'series', 'smile', 'shonen', 'shojo', 'title', 'so', 'darn', 'emotional', 'downright', 'sweet', ""'ll"", 'have', 'brush', 'teeth/fangs', 'afterwards', ""'ll"", 'get', 'cavities']",Karin: The Complete Series
1239509,A2O0LFHVG8D4Z7,B001US3XV4,Thomas,"[0, 0]","... Or so says Karin, a teenage high school girl who hides a secret: she comes from a family of vampires! However, she holds an even greater secret: she's actually an un-vampire who creates blood rather than drinks it, forcing her to expel the excess blood into a human once a month, otherwise she has an enormous nosebleed! This anime is loosely based off of the manga series ""Karin"" (called ""Chibi Vampire"" in America) and the escapades that ensue due to her ridiculous state.Visuals: 10/10This anime has some impressive animation, and the animators put a lot of work into the series. For example: at every episode midpoint there are animations that close for a commercial break and lead back into the show. These are completely unique: once you see one, you will never see it again, as it will be replaced by something entirely new next episode. The show utilizes a bright color palette, making for a very pretty experience. The opening of the anime is strange though, as it shows Karin in some VERY er... strange positions that we NEVER see in the actual show. This anime is probably not safe to show the kids, especially with the content of some of the episodes.Audio: 9/10I watched this show with the English dub, and I loved it. I love the voices of Karin and Usui (he sounded exactly like I imagined him in my head). There is also a new character that is only in the anime series, Winner Sinclaire, whose English voice is SO BAD that it's actually good. You have to hear it to believe it. Music wasn't very memorable except for the show's opening theme, Scarlet, which is very very catchy.Story: 7/10The story of the anime is basically fluff, and it doesn't do the original manga justice at all. Still, as a standalone, it's not bad. Winner's presence allows for a lot of comic relief, and the plot is almost completely different than the manga. I like to think that the anime takes place somewhere in the middle of the manga, even though that would set up a bunch of continuity errors.Overall, the only other thing I seem to have a problem with is the price. $90+?!?! This anime is almost as big an offender as Read or Die: the TV, which is very pricy due to the packaging, content, and the fact that it's been out of print for a long time. Still, I bought the new box set for Martian Successor Nadesico for only about $40, and that had 26 episodes, a feature length movie, AND an OVA, along with some never-before-seen bonus content. So if you want to spend the $90, that's your choice, as it is a high qulity anime, but you could probably find it within the vast reaches of the internet somewhere.Overall Score: 8.5 nosebleeds / 10",5,"Oh, It's So Embarrassing!!",1368921600,"05 19, 2013",2013,2642,"['so', 'Karin', 'teenage', 'high', 'school', 'girl', 'who', 'secret', 'family', 'vampires', 'However', 'even', 'greater', 'secret', 'actually', 'un-vampire', 'who', 'blood', 'rather', 'drinks', 'forcing', 'expel', 'excess', 'blood', 'human', 'once', 'month', 'otherwise', 'enormous', 'nosebleed', 'anime', 'loosely', 'based', 'manga', 'series', 'Karin', 'called', 'Chibi', 'Vampire', 'America', 'escapades', 'ensue', 'due', 'ridiculous', 'state.Visuals', '10/10This', 'anime', 'impressive', 'animation', 'animators', 'put', 'lot', 'work', 'series', 'example', 'episode', 'midpoint', 'are', 'animations', 'close', 'commercial', 'break', 'lead', 'back', 'show', 'are', 'completely', 'unique', 'once', 'see', 'one', 'will', 'never', 'see', 'again', 'will', 'be', 'replaced', 'something', 'entirely', 'new', 'next', 'episode', 'show', 'bright', 'color', 'palette', 'making', 'very', 'pretty', 'experience', 'opening', 'anime', 'strange', 'though', 'Karin', 'VERY', 'er', 'strange', 'positions', 'NEVER', 'see', 'actual', 'show', 'anime', 'probably', 'not', 'safe', 'show', 'kids', 'especially', 'content', 'episodes.Audio', '9/10I', 'watched', 'show', 'English', 'dub', 'loved', 'love', 'voices', 'Karin', 'Usui', 'sounded', 'exactly', 'imagined', 'head', 'also', 'new', 'character', 'only', 'anime', 'series', 'Winner', 'Sinclaire', 'English', 'voice', 'SO', 'BAD', 'actually', 'good', 'have', 'hear', 'believe', 'Music', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'memorable', 'show', 'opening', 'theme', 'Scarlet', 'very', 'very', 'catchy.Story', '7/10The', 'story', 'anime', 'basically', 'fluff', ""n't"", 'do', 'original', 'manga', 'justice', 'Still', 'standalone', 'not', 'bad', 'Winner', 'presence', 'lot', 'comic', 'relief', 'plot', 'almost', 'completely', 'different', 'manga', 'like', 'think', 'anime', 'place', 'somewhere', 'middle', 'manga', 'even', 'would', 'set', 'up', 'bunch', 'continuity', 'errors.Overall', 'only', 'other', 'thing', 'seem', 'have', 'problem', 'price', '90+', 'anime', 'almost', 'big', 'offender', 'Read', 'Die', 'TV', 'very', 'pricy', 'due', 'packaging', 'content', 'fact', 'been', 'print', 'long', 'time', 'Still', 'bought', 'new', 'box', 'set', 'Martian', 'Successor', 'Nadesico', 'only', '40', 'had', '26', 'episodes', 'feature', 'length', 'movie', 'OVA', 'never-before-seen', 'bonus', 'content', 'So', 'want', 'spend', '90', 'choice', 'high', 'qulity', 'anime', 'could', 'probably', 'find', 'vast', 'reaches', 'internet', 'somewhere.Overall', 'Score', '8.5', 'nosebleeds', '/', '10']",Karin: The Complete Series
