The film also has a spiritual dimension because the actions of the two children ultimately cause a badly dysfunctional marriage to come &#34;unstuck&#34; and enter into fulfillment.",5,Very French!,1394409600,"03 10, 2014",2014,402,"['film', 'very', 'frank', 'humorous', 'view', 'life', 'French', 'country', 'village', '1950s', 'seen', 'point', 'view', 'two', 'children', 'age', '9', '10', 'who', 'are', 'trying', 'make', 'sense', 'adult', 'world', 'see', 'film', 'also', 'spiritual', 'dimension', 'actions', 'two', 'children', 'ultimately', 'cause', 'badly', 'dysfunctional', 'marriage', 'come', '34', 'unstuck', '34', 'enter', 'fulfillment']",Le Grand Chemin VHS

The original, however, was blessed by sincere honesty, especially in the performances by all, including the director's ten year old son and the aunt & uncle the boy is deposited with for one summer. The eccentric locals are not overdone, the aunt & uncle's gradually revealed nightmare is resolved, and an at times tormenting tomboy girlfriend is humanised, all through the presence of one ten year old outsider. This is a sweet little gem of a movie, as the French do so well. It will remind one of Francois Truffaut and Louis Malle films like Small Change, Murmur of the Heart and Au Revoir Les Enfants.

Supposedly set in 1959, it seems more like the mid 50's. Filmed in 1986 with the director's son at age 10 it paints a canvas of rural French life, litle changed from prewarprovenchialism. Within the film's framework are most of life's circumstances torn open and closed in a delightful manner.

There's no gloss or phoniness, just real kids in real situations who sometimes observe real adult relationships. There was just one drawback for me and that was the cunnilingus and coitus scene with the young lovers, which was secretly observed by the kids. It was not done in an X-rated fashion but was seen from some distance and was very naturally portrayed. But I'm uncomfortable having it in my library for reasons I'll not relate here.
