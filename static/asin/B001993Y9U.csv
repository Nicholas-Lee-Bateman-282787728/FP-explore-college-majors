There still is no release of this show's remaining seasons on DVD, and who knows when or if there will be.  It's already been years since Season 4 was put out, and still no Season 5.  This might not be the ideal format, but Amazon has at last made the episodes available, and I for one am overjoyed.I got into this show late and didn't see all of the episodes when they aired.  I saw a lot of the re-runs in syndication, but not all.  I've been hanging on the whole Joe Salvo cliffhanger for years, wondering if Sipowicz offed him to protect Bobby.  Finally, closure on that storyline!Amazon's instant player is simple.  You can pause during the episodes, fast-forward or rewind in thirty-second intervals using the arrow buttons or click in the progress bar wherever you want, alternate to full screen or ""pop-out,"" placing the video in a separate window, and control the volume.  The one legitimate complaint is that it has no captions, so you're out of luck if you need those.  Otherwise, it's a user-friendly video player that I've had no problems watching on my laptop.Highlights of this season include Sipowicz showing growth as a father and husband, and the progression of relationships for Bobby and Diane, as well as James Martinez and Gina.  The show doesn't back off of its trademark graphic content, giving viewers an up-close look at the daily tragedies that occur in a  big city like NYC.  While I'd love to see the rest of this series released on DVD or Blu-ray, it's great to finally be able to see the rest of these episodes.
