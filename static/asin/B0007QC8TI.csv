887289,A1RAAN9QXO8DP,B0007QC8TI,Michael A. Martinez,"[17, 18]","This is admittedly a good war film, probably my favorite from the era of Italian filmmaking before the Spaghetti Western changed everything and all their movies were done in English.  This movie kind of sticks with this later trend with cameos by Peter Falk and Arthur Kennedy (though they are only CAMEOS mind you), but the English dubbing is much worse than usual.  The bulk of the cast is played by fairly anonymous Italian and Russian actors, the scope is grand, but the battle scenes fairly disappointing.  Also the film is annoyingly pro-soviet, especially during the soviet anthem singing scenes and then later with the heroic partisans.However, this DVD, for all it's expensiveness, is frankly horrible.  It's an obvious transfer from a VHS tape, and from a VCR that had a hard time with the tracking control.  On top of that, there is no menu, and no chapter stops... so to stop watching and start again means you have to sit and FF through the movie as fast as your DVD player will let you.Hold out and wait for a better version of this little-seen war classic to come out.  In the meantime, dig up the old VHS tape as it's basically the same thing.",3,like the Worst DVD Ever!,1144886400,"04 13, 2006",2006,1159,"['admittedly', 'good', 'war', 'film', 'probably', 'favorite', 'era', 'Italian', 'filmmaking', 'Spaghetti', 'Western', 'changed', 'everything', 'movies', 'were', 'done', 'English', 'movie', 'kind', 'sticks', 'later', 'trend', 'cameos', 'Peter', 'Falk', 'Arthur', 'Kennedy', 'are', 'only', 'CAMEOS', 'English', 'dubbing', 'much', 'worse', 'usual', 'bulk', 'cast', 'played', 'fairly', 'anonymous', 'Italian', 'Russian', 'actors', 'scope', 'grand', 'battle', 'fairly', 'disappointing', 'Also', 'film', 'annoyingly', 'pro-soviet', 'especially', 'soviet', 'anthem', 'singing', 'scenes', 'then', 'later', 'heroic', 'partisans.However', 'DVD', 'expensiveness', 'frankly', 'horrible', 'obvious', 'transfer', 'VHS', 'tape', 'VCR', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'tracking', 'control', 'top', 'menu', 'chapter', 'stops', 'so', 'stop', 'watching', 'start', 'again', 'means', 'have', 'sit', 'FF', 'movie', 'as', 'fast', 'DVD', 'player', 'will', 'let', 'you.Hold', 'out', 'wait', 'better', 'version', 'little-seen', 'war', 'classic', 'come', 'out', 'meantime', 'dig', 'up', 'old', 'VHS', 'tape', 'basically', 'same', 'thing']",N/A
