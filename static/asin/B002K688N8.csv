1274179,A3N8RZSXKN1OR2,B002K688N8,Chrijeff,"[10, 11]","It's a little-known fact that the Hawaiian Islands are the location of several notable cattle ranches, staffed by native wranglers known as ""paniolos"" (a word that probably derives from ""Espanol,"" or Spanish, the ethnicity of the Western Hemisphere's original mounted cattle-herders).  This Disney double-length TV episode suggests how they came to be.  Sometime in the 1870's, Texas cowboy Lincoln Costain (James Garner)--""a wronged man"" who was presumably shanghaiied to sea, though details are never supplied--washes ashore on the island of Kauai after leaping overboard from a sailcraft and is found by Booton MacAvoy (Eric Shea), whose widowed mother Henrietta (Disney stalwart Vera Miles) takes him in.  Linc soon discovers that the MacAvoys have two major issues: their potato farm isn't doing at all well financially, and their home compound is frequently invaded by small herds of half-wild cattle (""the animals"").  Wanting to repay their hospitality, he suggests that they try to round up the creatures, which are worth $20 or more a head in California, and that leads him to trying to make cowhands of their Hawaiian farm workers--not the easiest job he's ever undertaken.  (""I better get back to Texas before I lose my stitchin',"" he says-- ""I have nightmares about these people you wouldn't believe!"")  Coping with local produce factor, moneylender, and storekeeper Calvin Bryson (Robert Culp), who's courting Henrietta in defiance of Booton's doubts, the cultural gap between Texas and the Islands, a native sorcerer (Nephi Hanneman) in Bryson's pay, and the contrary nature of bovines, he keeps at it, and triumphs over all obstacles in the end.  How he does it is funny, fast-moving, and full of action.  Garner made several Disney films, but this is among the best.",4,Making paniolos,1263427200,"01 14, 2010",2010,1782,"['little-known', 'fact', 'Hawaiian', 'Islands', 'are', 'location', 'several', 'notable', 'cattle', 'ranches', 'staffed', 'native', 'wranglers', 'known', 'paniolos', 'word', 'probably', 'Espanol', 'Spanish', 'ethnicity', 'Western', 'Hemisphere', 'original', 'mounted', 'cattle-herders', 'Disney', 'double-length', 'TV', 'episode', 'how', 'came', 'be', 'Sometime', '1870', 'Texas', 'cowboy', 'Lincoln', 'Costain', 'James', 'Garner', 'wronged', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'presumably', 'shanghaiied', 'sea', 'details', 'are', 'never', 'supplied', 'washes', 'ashore', 'island', 'Kauai', 'leaping', 'overboard', 'sailcraft', 'found', 'Booton', 'MacAvoy', 'Eric', 'Shea', 'widowed', 'mother', 'Henrietta', 'Disney', 'stalwart', 'Vera', 'Miles', 'Linc', 'soon', 'MacAvoys', 'have', 'two', 'major', 'issues', 'potato', 'farm', ""n't"", 'doing', 'well', 'financially', 'home', 'compound', 'frequently', 'invaded', 'small', 'herds', 'half-wild', 'cattle', 'animals', 'Wanting', 'repay', 'hospitality', 'try', 'round', 'up', 'creatures', 'are', 'worth', '20', 'more', 'head', 'California', 'trying', 'make', 'cowhands', 'Hawaiian', 'farm', 'workers', 'not', 'easiest', 'job', 'ever', 'undertaken', 'better', 'get', 'back', 'Texas', 'lose', 'stitchin', 'have', 'nightmares', 'people', 'would', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Coping', 'local', 'produce', 'factor', 'moneylender', 'storekeeper', 'Calvin', 'Bryson', 'Robert', 'Culp', 'who', 'courting', 'Henrietta', 'defiance', 'Booton', 'doubts', 'cultural', 'gap', 'Texas', 'Islands', 'native', 'sorcerer', 'Nephi', 'Hanneman', 'Bryson', 'pay', 'contrary', 'nature', 'bovines', 'triumphs', 'obstacles', 'end', 'How', 'funny', 'fast-moving', 'full', 'action', 'Garner', 'made', 'several', 'Disney', 'films', 'best']",N/A
1274180,A3N95R1VKWROWF,B002K688N8,Christopher Schwinger,"[0, 0]","This movie is about a cowboy (James Garner) who washes ashore onto Hawaii, having been previously shanghaied and escaped.  He hesitantly sticks around to help Vera Miles and her son make the farm profitable, and decides they can do much better raising cattle than potatoes.  He has to face his own longing to return to Texas, and external challenges:  a thug hired by the wealthy man who wants the farm, the challenges of training Hawaiians to be cowboys, and the logistics of transporting cattle to ships.  There's not a lot of character development, but there's some humor and several sections of intense action.  I think it's a fairly good movie because it has an interesting story, decent script, and decent amount of variety (and it has a cute Hawaiian melody that gets used throughout).  And if you like James Garner, his character has the components he's best-loved for:  his unique kind of verbal comeback, his confident yet careful card-playing, and standoffishness.",4,Interesting story,1361491200,"02 22, 2013",2013,975,"['movie', 'cowboy', 'James', 'Garner', 'who', 'ashore', 'onto', 'Hawaii', 'having', 'been', 'previously', 'shanghaied', 'escaped', 'hesitantly', 'help', 'Vera', 'Miles', 'son', 'make', 'farm', 'profitable', 'can', 'do', 'much', 'better', 'raising', 'cattle', 'potatoes', 'face', 'own', 'longing', 'return', 'Texas', 'external', 'challenges', 'thug', 'hired', 'wealthy', 'man', 'who', 'farm', 'challenges', 'training', 'Hawaiians', 'be', 'cowboys', 'logistics', 'transporting', 'cattle', 'ships', 'not', 'lot', 'character', 'development', 'humor', 'several', 'sections', 'intense', 'action', 'think', 'fairly', 'good', 'movie', 'interesting', 'story', 'decent', 'script', 'decent', 'amount', 'variety', 'cute', 'Hawaiian', 'melody', 'used', 'like', 'James', 'Garner', 'character', 'components', 'best-loved', 'unique', 'kind', 'verbal', 'comeback', 'confident', 'yet', 'careful', 'card-playing', 'standoffishness']",N/A
1274181,A6PF1K6FSLUWD,B002K688N8,Elaine M. Manneh,"[0, 0]",Disney at his best is depicted in this film which takes place on the island of Maui. The usual theme of hero who rescuses the financial strapped widow escape from the trappings of the greedy landowner is evident. What makes this film delightful is the humor while the castaway cowboy tries to train the natives to be ranchers. I highly recommend this film for families who want a wholesome evening's entertainment with their families.,5,Castaway Cowboy,1337817600,"05 24, 2012",2012,434,"['Disney', 'best', 'depicted', 'film', 'place', 'island', 'Maui', 'usual', 'theme', 'hero', 'who', 'financial', 'strapped', 'widow', 'escape', 'trappings', 'greedy', 'landowner', 'evident', 'What', 'film', 'delightful', 'humor', 'castaway', 'cowboy', 'tries', 'train', 'natives', 'be', 'ranchers', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'families', 'who', 'want', 'wholesome', 'evening', 'entertainment', 'families']",N/A

I was disappointed however in the visual quality. It looks like this must have been made from an old tape. It was very contrasty in most of the dark scenes (proably 10% of the time) to the point it was hard to see what was going on. In good light (full daylight) the visual was fine. I recommend this for the quality of the movie but don't expect perfect visual viewing. The sound was ok throughout the movie though.,3,CastawayCowboy,1358899200,"01 23, 2013",2013,537,"['great', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'VHS', 'tape', 'James', 'Garner', 'best', 'very', 'nice', 'family', 'movie', 'too', 'was', 'disappointed', 'however', 'visual', 'quality', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'old', 'tape', 'was', 'very', 'contrasty', 'most', 'dark', 'scenes', 'proably', '10', '%', 'time', 'point', 'was', 'hard', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'good', 'light', 'full', 'daylight', 'visual', 'was', 'fine', 'recommend', 'quality', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'perfect', 'visual', 'viewing', 'sound', 'was', 'ok', 'movie']",N/A
