That's the impression you get of the infamous Marie ""Let Them Eat Cake"" Antoinette presented here. Kirsten Dunst, well cast as the queen, actually says she would never say ""Let them eat cake"" in this movie. There seems to me elements of truth to this but I took it all in very lightly while looking at beautiful and elaborate costumes, the Palace of Versailles, the wigs, the shoes, the food and pastries, all the while listening to that New Wave/""alternative"" soundtrack. I think we're exploring the personal and subjective here more than the political and historical... And we are enjoying playing dress-up. I had a sense of what to expect before seeing it so I enjoyed the show. The film Coppola made wasn't one that many critics wanted and nor for that matter is it a portrayal of Marie Antoinette and the French court that I'd have been most interested in. But it is what it is and it's a good movie and the one the director wanted to make. You got to give some points for originality. Judged based on what seems to be what Sofia Coppola wanted to do here, it works.I look forward to more from Sofia Coppola. LOST IN TRANSLATION is a favorite. Her films are so moody and atmospheric, at times dreamlike, and I that's what I like most about them.Maybe check out ""Ten things that occurred to me while watching MARIE ANTOINETTE"" by Roger Ebert on his website for some nice insight and appreciation. Ebert is a great friend to the movies and I hope he's around for a long time to come. Also, The New Yorker's Anthony Lane's piece ""Lost in the Revolution"" is excellent.

648259,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B00005JPAS,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[1, 3]","'Marie Antoinette' tries to do with it's subject matter what 'Amadeus' did for Mozart.  This playful rendition is done reflectively by the artful hand of director Sofia Coppola who through Kirsten Dunst gives us a sympathetic portrayal.  Being the olive branch from and for Austria, Marie's acquisition as the queen of France takes on a whole new meaning.  Since her young husband King Louis XVI is more interested in hunting than consummating their marriage, she fails to live up to her role of providing a successor--for a consequentially long time.  She drowns her sorrows through the morning ritual, complete with courtiers who dote on every morning whim, including champagne, sumptuous food, and a large appetite for extravagant confections.  All the details are done in stunning detail, even if Ms. Coppola stops to reflect too long and too often.  Their dereliction is not entirely apparent to them, but is solidified when Louis, ironically, decides to fund the American Revolution at his expense--in more ways than one.  Once her appetite for gambling and jewels is solidified, it is hard to retract its effects on long bread lines and excruciating poverty.  The repercussions creep up on them, making the audience feel its blind-siding impact from the couples' point-of-view.  In order for the film to work, we have to sympathize with the protagonists, and at first we do.  For throwing away decorum, she charitably introduces applause at the opera, and quickly and easily freezes all need for new jewelry.  The classical and rock music accentuate the scenes, and, while it may seem misplaced for the latter, we realize how much of a tragic misfit she may have been in the royal scheme of things.  The rest, as they say, is history.'Marie Antoinette' is a stylish, if not overlong, new look at a colorful, misunderstood famous figure.  Usually personified as arrogance itself, she shrugged off being misunderstood and let's us know that she did not indeed say, ""Let them eat cake"" afterall.

Kirsten Dunst's acting is spotty - varying from good to unbelievable to horrible. This film was pretty bad - the storyline was flimsy, historical facts were adjusted or conveniently eliminated, the ending was anti-climactic, the acting from the rest of the cast was mediocre at best. The only exception is perhaps Joan Cusack, but her performance is so brief and hardly her personal best. The soundtrack was highly inappropriate and actually detracted from whatever goodwill the movie managed to generate with its outstanding sets. Furthermore, the one thing that must be said about this movie is that the costumes were exceptional and rightly Oscar-nominated. In the end this is hardly surprising - it says a lot about the movie when the shoes (Manolo Blaniks) are more likely to be discussed than everything and anything else about the movie.",2,beautiful but insubstantial,1198022400,"12 19, 2007",2007,961,"['intuition', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'bad', 'movie', 'watched', 'anyway', 'intuitions', 'were', ""n't"", 'wrong', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'acting', 'spotty', 'varying', 'good', 'unbelievable', 'horrible', 'film', 'was', 'pretty', 'bad', 'storyline', 'was', 'flimsy', 'historical', 'facts', 'were', 'adjusted', 'conveniently', 'eliminated', 'ending', 'was', 'anti-climactic', 'acting', 'rest', 'cast', 'was', 'mediocre', 'best', 'only', 'exception', 'perhaps', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'performance', 'so', 'brief', 'hardly', 'personal', 'best', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'highly', 'inappropriate', 'actually', 'detracted', 'goodwill', 'movie', 'managed', 'generate', 'outstanding', 'sets', 'Furthermore', 'one', 'thing', 'must', 'be', 'said', 'movie', 'costumes', 'were', 'exceptional', 'rightly', 'Oscar-nominated', 'end', 'hardly', 'surprising', 'lot', 'movie', 'when', 'shoes', 'Manolo', 'Blaniks', 'are', 'more', 'likely', 'be', 'discussed', 'everything', 'anything', 'else', 'movie']",Marie Antoinette

Barral ""NY LuxViewer""","[4, 7]","Do not consider this movie without first seeing Norma Shearer's 1938 version, which was at least closer to the historical truth in interpretation. This version has better costumes and does relate some incidents that were true, but it is so bland and vapid and Kirsten Dunst is so one-dimensional as the queen that one can not understand why the Revolution even happened.With plenty of actresses that would have done a superb job, such as Cate Blanchett, I don't comprehend this choice that resulted in one of the most limited, dull interpretations possible. The limitation of all the action to Versailles is also incomprehensible because Marie Antoinette spent a lot of time in Paris during her youth.There is no insight into the queen's personality that would lead you to suspect that she would become the heroine and martyr of the Revolution,  an image that still haunts the French Republic today and is the sole driving force in her historical interest.The whole movie is forgettable and does NOT resemble the Antonia fraser book, ""Marie Antoinette: The Journey"" which is an excellent, insightful biography on the Queen, and probably the best that is available in English.

648263,AGEIT17HENDIS,B00005JPAS,Alfred Johnson,"[2, 4]","Cultural fashions come and go. Apparently, of late, there has been a resurgence of interest in the life of Marie Antoinette, late of Austria and Queen of France during the period of the great French Revolution that began in 1789. Although you would not know that revolution was in the air from this film since it is very tightly focused on the alleged trials and tribulations of being a teenager, fodder in the dynastic politics of the period and unsuccessfully maturing in the late 1700's. And it is also a quasi-feminist attempt to bring Marie into the `sisterhood' of modern feminism. Someone once said that revolutionary periods create conditions where the old society can no longer rule in the old way (although they sure as hell try) and produce leaders particularly ill-suited to the tasks of the times. That is certainly the case here. Ms. Coppola's attempt to create some retroactive sympathy for the character of not so sweet Marie simply does not work.

648264,A15E01890A5IX5,B00005JPAS,Alison Leigh,"[20, 30]","After seeing the previews and hype surrounded by Sofia Coppola's new film, I could not wait for it to come out. However, after I left the movie theatre, I was honestly wishing that I had not wasted my time or money.There are so many things wrong with the film Marie Antoinette that I hardly know where to begin. First, why in the world was Kirsten Dunst cast as the ill-fated queen? I don't believe that she is a bad actress, but she could do this role no justice; she is too modern and never seems to age throughout the entire movie. They should have gotten an actress who was a little older and more polished, such as Joely Richardson's portrayal in The Affair of the Necklace.Second, no matter what excuses people may come up with, you cannot base an entire film around a historical event, particularly one such as the French Revolution, without providing some sort of historical context and background. This is possible without being a documentary--just look at the wonderful movies produced by the BBC and films such as Shekar Kapur's Elizabeth (though it was not entirely historically accurate). Marie Antoinette, on the other hand, gives us all fluff with no substance. Viewers get no idea of the political turmoil that is going on in France around this time, and just why exactly the French hate her. The abrupt end is even more ridiculous as the movie does not even show Marie and Louis XVI's tragic fates (they were beheaded and the monarchy abolished). For those who are not up on their history, they might wonder what exactly happened to them as they rode off in their carriage in the wind.I understand that Coppola probably wanted to mainly show the decadence and selfishness of the Versailles court, but we do not have to keep being reminded of it through unnecessary scenes which serve no purpose but to highlight the excesses of the court. Because of this, the film is extremely slow-moving, and there were many times when I was outright bored (highly unusual since I have an alarmingly high attention-span).I would strongly urge moviegoers not to waste their money on this dud; skip it and get the new PBS documentary and the 1938 film version with Norma Shearer. The only thing good I can say about this movie is that the costumes and sets are glorious; the food in it also looks delectable.This movie claims it was based on the Antonia Fraser biography, but the only thing that could have been taken from it was its name.",1,Sorely Disappointed,1161388800,"10 21, 2006",2006,2440,"['seeing', 'previews', 'hype', 'surrounded', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'new', 'film', 'could', 'not', 'wait', 'come', 'out', 'However', 'left', 'movie', 'theatre', 'was', 'honestly', 'wishing', 'had', 'not', 'wasted', 'time', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'wrong', 'film', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'hardly', 'know', 'where', 'begin', 'First', 'why', 'world', 'was', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'cast', 'ill-fated', 'queen', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'bad', 'actress', 'could', 'do', 'role', 'justice', 'too', 'modern', 'never', 'age', 'entire', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'gotten', 'actress', 'who', 'was', 'little', 'older', 'more', 'polished', 'such', 'Joely', 'Richardson', 'portrayal', 'Affair', 'Necklace.Second', 'matter', 'what', 'people', 'may', 'come', 'up', 'can', 'not', 'base', 'entire', 'film', 'historical', 'event', 'particularly', 'one', 'such', 'French', 'Revolution', 'providing', 'sort', 'historical', 'context', 'background', 'possible', 'being', 'documentary', 'just', 'look', 'wonderful', 'movies', 'produced', 'BBC', 'films', 'such', 'Shekar', 'Kapur', 'Elizabeth', 'was', 'not', 'entirely', 'historically', 'accurate', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'other', 'hand', 'fluff', 'substance', 'Viewers', 'get', 'idea', 'political', 'turmoil', 'going', 'France', 'time', 'just', 'why', 'exactly', 'French', 'hate', 'abrupt', 'end', 'even', 'more', 'ridiculous', 'movie', 'not', 'even', 'show', 'Marie', 'Louis', 'XVI', 'tragic', 'fates', 'were', 'beheaded', 'monarchy', 'abolished', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'history', 'might', 'wonder', 'what', 'exactly', 'happened', 'rode', 'off', 'carriage', 'wind.I', 'understand', 'Coppola', 'probably', 'wanted', 'mainly', 'show', 'decadence', 'selfishness', 'Versailles', 'court', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'keep', 'being', 'reminded', 'unnecessary', 'scenes', 'serve', 'purpose', 'highlight', 'excesses', 'court', 'film', 'extremely', 'slow-moving', 'were', 'many', 'times', 'when', 'was', 'outright', 'bored', 'highly', 'unusual', 'have', 'alarmingly', 'high', 'attention-span', '.I', 'would', 'strongly', 'urge', 'moviegoers', 'not', 'waste', 'money', 'dud', 'get', 'new', 'PBS', 'documentary', '1938', 'film', 'version', 'Norma', 'Shearer', 'only', 'thing', 'good', 'can', 'say', 'movie', 'costumes', 'sets', 'are', 'glorious', 'food', 'also', 'delectable.This', 'movie', 'claims', 'was', 'based', 'Antonia', 'Fraser', 'biography', 'only', 'thing', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'taken', 'was', 'name']",Marie Antoinette

She never really grows up, but the film seems to ask, What were her options? Her options boil down to the style of sleeve she will choose for her new frock or the tasty tidbit she will choose to put in her mouth from the endless array of picture-perfect pastries that are always at her elbow. The soundtrack is peppered with 80s' new wave tunes--which I thought brilliantly played up the youthful self-absorption of Marie and her courtiers as they gamble, eat, drink and watch the sun rise: they haven't a thought beyond their experience of the now as pure pleasure. It never occurs to them that life could consist of anything other than complete self-indulgence.I did not feel sorry for the Marie Antoinette of this film, but I understood her far more deeply than I expected to. What really came as a surprise was the dignity with which she accepts her fate at the end of the film, and surrenders herself to the will of the people. She seemed to understand perfectly that it was her turn to be served up as a royal tidbit at the guillotine, and she surrenders to her fate without a moment's hesitation. We certainly aren't supposed to pity her, but there is a kind of relief in one of the closing shots which shows the destruction wrought upon the royal bedroom by the &#34;rabble&#34; who were starving to death as Marie continued trumping each previous pleasure with a new one.",5,THE BEAUTY OF THE WRETCHED EXCESS THAT WAS MARIE ANTOINETTE'S LIFE,1396224000,"03 31, 2014",2014,2031,"['hauntingly', 'beautiful', 'look', 'close-up', 'banality', 'decadence', 'supreme', 'narcissism', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'life', 'film', 'life', 'microcosm', 'entire', 'regime', 'meaninglessly', 'composed', 'wretched', 'excess', 'one', 'form', 'camera', 'lovingly', 'beautiful', 'nauseatingly', 'sweet', 'over-ripe', 'excesses', 'were', 'Versailles.Sophia', 'Coppola', 'girl', 'queen', 'fate', 'consummate', 'artistry', 'revealing', 'both', 'young', 'queen', 'who', 'occasion', 'innocent', 'obedient', 'girl', 'who', 'never', 'spiteful', 'cruel', 'women', 'who', 'surround', 'court', 'never', 'really', 'up', 'film', 'ask', 'What', 'were', 'options', 'options', 'boil', 'style', 'sleeve', 'will', 'choose', 'new', 'frock', 'tasty', 'tidbit', 'will', 'choose', 'put', 'mouth', 'endless', 'array', 'picture-perfect', 'pastries', 'are', 'always', 'elbow', 'soundtrack', 'peppered', '80s', 'new', 'wave', 'tunes', 'thought', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'up', 'youthful', 'self-absorption', 'Marie', 'courtiers', 'gamble', 'eat', 'drink', 'watch', 'sun', 'rise', 'have', ""n't"", 'thought', 'experience', 'now', 'pure', 'pleasure', 'never', 'life', 'could', 'consist', 'anything', 'other', 'complete', 'self-indulgence.I', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'sorry', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'film', 'understood', 'far', 'more', 'deeply', 'expected', 'What', 'really', 'came', 'surprise', 'was', 'dignity', 'fate', 'end', 'film', 'surrenders', 'will', 'people', 'seemed', 'understand', 'perfectly', 'was', 'turn', 'be', 'served', 'up', 'royal', 'tidbit', 'guillotine', 'fate', 'moment', 'hesitation', 'certainly', 'are', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'pity', 'kind', 'relief', 'one', 'closing', 'shots', 'destruction', 'wrought', 'royal', 'bedroom', '34', 'rabble', '34', 'who', 'were', 'starving', 'death', 'Marie', 'continued', 'trumping', 'previous', 'pleasure', 'new', 'one']",Marie Antoinette

Maybe I had low expectations, but I felt the spirit and tone of this film was very true to life in portraying Marie Antoinette and her intimate circle.The film is a confection of beautiful costumes and exquisite sets and the acting was refreshingly natural.  Kirsten Dunst gave me a glimpse of what I believe the young Queen was really like.  It's a fact that Marie Antoinette was immature (her own mother noted this in a letter to Louis XV), not particularly analytical or intellectual, fond of creature comforts, and, doubtless, terribly isolated and wary of her unstable position with her frigid husband.I expected the modern touches (dyed wigs and modern music in the soundtrack) to be jarring.  Instead I found them subtle enough to be harmonious.  The sight of the opulent courtiers flouncing and frisking to hard rock in a masque ball was genuine, the music matches the character of the decadent age.This film is a work of art and I cannot believe some people disliked it.",4,A delight,1172448000,"02 26, 2007",2007,1024,"['watched', 'film', 'twice', 'weekend', 'Maybe', 'had', 'low', 'expectations', 'felt', 'spirit', 'tone', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'true', 'life', 'portraying', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'intimate', 'circle.The', 'film', 'confection', 'beautiful', 'costumes', 'exquisite', 'sets', 'acting', 'was', 'refreshingly', 'natural', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'gave', 'glimpse', 'what', 'believe', 'young', 'Queen', 'was', 'really', 'like', 'fact', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'was', 'immature', 'own', 'mother', 'noted', 'letter', 'Louis', 'XV', 'not', 'particularly', 'analytical', 'intellectual', 'fond', 'creature', 'comforts', 'doubtless', 'terribly', 'isolated', 'wary', 'unstable', 'position', 'frigid', 'husband.I', 'expected', 'modern', 'touches', 'dyed', 'wigs', 'modern', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'be', 'jarring', 'Instead', 'found', 'subtle', 'enough', 'be', 'harmonious', 'sight', 'opulent', 'courtiers', 'flouncing', 'frisking', 'hard', 'rock', 'masque', 'ball', 'was', 'genuine', 'music', 'character', 'decadent', 'age.This', 'film', 'work', 'art', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'people', 'disliked']",Marie Antoinette
648268,A20VXYT5DL0ZC6,B00005JPAS,"Amazon Customer ""Creator, Entrepreneur, Free ...","[0, 6]","In a dark age of grunge and hype and cynicism and lazy greed, only Sophia Coppola had the daring and faith and courage to actually attempt to create something of pure beauty and grace. Marie Antoinette is an epic achievement in cinematic aesthetics and artistry which also turns out to be a compelling, well-acted story of the tragic, beautiful Austrian girl who became a French immortal. I saw Marie Antoinette at The 2006 New York Film Festival world premiere which Sophia and Kirsten Dunst attended. As they entered Alice Tully Hall and a billion flashbulbs exploded, we began to applaud these glittering stars who strove for impossible perfection, and managed to pull it off. After the film, during the audience questions, I complimented Sophia on being practically the lone filmmaker today with the courage and belief to try to make things which are really beautiful. It's shocking how few filmmakers do that anymore. Do we really need another filmmaker to set a new record for over-the-top special effects, or amount paid to superstars, or the record for movie advertising budgets, or trying to be the biggest opening weekend grosser in history? How gross! Is that what filmmaking and Hollywood are supposed to be about?? NO! Film is the domain of divine Beauty and Perfection. It is now time for a new cinematic renaissance where filmmaking ARTISTS reclaim their mandate to create fantasies and dramas and stories and tales which strive for perfection, genius, devastating beauty and legendary immortality, where the writing and production efforts dwarf trivial things like fx and big names. Sophia Coppola, and the few filmmakers like her, none other of whom can even come to my mind easily, has taken the first step by daringly attempting the nearly impossible: Making a film which has the nerve to emulate classic masterpieces of sublimity like Chinatown, The Shining, The Magnificent Ambersons, Ed Wood, Valmont, films of such beauty that to hope to achieve something similar is only like praying for miracles. But you can't achieve anything if you don't believe in it and try, and Sophia had the guts to attempt High Art while her colleagues in Follywood only keep attempting to make gobs of money. As the eternal truth goes, quality is always better and than quantity, and things of enduring value and worth end up paying handsomely for themselves in the end. Under the tutelage of her brilliant father Francis, auteur and overseer of such masterworks as Bram Stoker's Dracula, The Godfather saga, and The Black Stallion, Sophia has now taken up her family's banner and is herself worthy of knighthood. She has made the leap of faith, she has forged the gold of her spirit in the fire, she has Lived the Fantasy. It takes courage to make something beautiful, and only the courageous become the immortal. People who scorn and ridicule the brave only reveal their own sad mediocrity. Sophia Coppola is now an immortal because she was brave enough to dare to create immortal beauty.

648278,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JPAS,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 4]","Sophia Coppola's third film `Marie Antoinette' just may be her finest cinematic accomplishment.  It's enriched with life, character and charm and it still manages to layer itself with the subtle illusion of grief and misery that surrounded this tragic story.  Sophia, along with a brilliant cast, was able to take a story plucked fresh from the history books and make it relatable and entertaining, refreshing amidst the modern era of the biopic.  Coppola's film here mainly focuses on the woman that was Marie Antoinette and through Kirsten Dunst's brilliant performance the audience is brought to the soul of this woman and the soul of her conflict.  She as young, she was nave but most of all she was lost in a world far above her head, one trust upon her, one that embraced her and then turned on her when they needed a scapegoat.Dunst is riveting in the title role, and the film is really a showcase for her talent.  The film starts off with Marie just a young teenager who is promised in marriage to Louis-Auguste, played by Jason Schwartzman, in order to unite the countries of France and Austria, and it carries on till just shy of her execution.  Dunst is magically able to manipulate her character so effortlessly that the audience is baffled at Marie's subtle and gradual growth as a young Queen.  Schwartzman does a wonderful job playing the young husband, a man too young for the responsibility on his shoulders and too uninterested for the wife he's been given despite her beauty and magnetism.  One could say he's overwhelmed, maybe even a bit frightened.Sophia Coppola brilliantly scripted this masterpiece; everything from the dialog to the musical soundtrack is inventive, effective and refreshing.  The script is especially noteworthy, giving the royal courts a modern twist that resembles the tabloid covers that litter the concession stands each week.  Having long sequences of murmured gossip, whispered rumors and lust centered jealousy help make for a memorable and relatable experience.  The costume designs and set pieces are magical and add so many lavish layers to the already layered biopic.  The scenes blossoming forth with colorful fabrics, high fashion inspired shoes and pastries add visual depth to the reality that this Queen was just like every other young girl and helps make her more real to us.Marie Antoinette's devotion to her newfound country is stifled by her husband's refusal to consummate their marriage and her dire frustration in her inability to provide an heir that would unite her birthland with her homeland transcends right to the audience.  Marie Antoinette was a tragically misunderstood woman who did all that she could in a situation she had no control over.The supporting cast does a fine job as well, Judy Davis and Rip Torn sinking their teeth into their small roles, and Asia Argento is fantastically catty as the Kings mistress, but it's Rose Byrne that really stands out to me.  Her brazen obnoxious almost impish sexuality writhes off the screen and into the seat next to you and makes a very long lasting impression.

For a while it seemed like a solid period drama, a but slow, a bit flat, but a drama.  Then the diretor seemed to change direction, and the combination of filming and music (e.g., during some of the carriage scenes) reminded me of some rather bad 1960s films, back in the day when film-making was striving to be ""artsy"" at the expence of watchability (is this a word?  well, whatever), and then there were times when it looked like the director was shooting music video for MTV.

Not a big fan of this chick. Let me be honest. The Virgin Suicides was interesting, but disturbing and not all there. Lost in Translation was just that: lost in translation. But Marie Antoinette manages to deliver. Kinda. The movie's not as fast paced, not as colorful, not as musical, as you may think. The use of modern music, a la A Knight's Tale, is cool, but way under-used. I say that if you're going to do something modern with a period piece, you might as well go all out. The movie teeters between being flashy and cool and boring and dramatic. It never quite decides what it wants to be. And that's really my only beef with this flick. Kirsten Dunst and Jason Schwartzman are awesome. The costumes are amazing. And the story is involved, detailed, informative, and interesting.The movie centers around the marriage of Marie Antoinette, daughter of the Queen of Austria, to the French dauphin. Everyone's counting on her to produce an heir to the throne, but she and her husband aren't even sleeping together. They haven't even consummated the marriage. Every morning, there's a huge rigamoroll involving the entire court just to get Marie dressed. Then everyone watches as she eats. You can see on her face that she hates the hoity-toity customs, but she lives with it anyway. It really is a blow by blow of this chicks life, and one thing after another happens. Rent it. Enjoy it.

There is no plot, no real character development, and a VERY intrusive 80's soundtrack, that is totally inappropriate. In between those scenes are  mumbled jumbled dialogues of unknown people, talking vaguely about people the viewer doesn't know.

I like movies that get people riled up.I saw this knowing very little about Marie Antoinette and I think that made the experience that much more enjoyable.

If you get to watch the making of on this DVD, it helps you understand where Sofia was going and I think she did a marvelous job. She made it her own. The music (fantastic!), the costumes (gorgeous), and the sets are enough to keep your eyes fixed upon the screen.My only complaint would be the choice of Molly Shannon. She looked entirely out of place. It was like, ""Oh, look it's Molly Shannon playing dress-up.""This is more of an interpretation of the life of Marie Antoinette. Coppola's vision was to get people to think about why Marie spiraled out of control and chose decadence. As to whether you think it's right or wrong, that's the fun of a film like this.

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[3, 4]","After Sofia Coppola's successful films THE VIRGIN SUICIDES and LOST IN TRANSLATION, many movie-goers awaited her next masterpiece with baited breath. Taking on the life of MARIE ANTOINETTE is no small feat, too. Here is someone who's short life and reign as Queen of France ended in head-tumbling fashion, but affected France's government for years to come.It is unfortunate that a few factors ruined this film, causing it to get booed at the Cannes Film Festival and leaving it with lackluster gains at the box office. But many who were displeased with this rendition of her life have rightly showed their displeasure.I'm not going to give you a history lesson, as I'm assuming most of you know about the life and times of Marie Antoinette. But I will give you some idea what to expect if you watch the film.First, expect to enjoy the great sets and costumes. Any gal who loves to go shoe shopping will probably drool over the number of scenes involving footwear (perhaps too many) and their excellent designs. Heading from the feet upward, the dresses, wigs, fans, and head-wear are also very nicely arranged and in accordance with the times. The film was shot on-location in Versailles, so no one should be able to complain about the authenticity of the sets.But from here the production takes a serious nosedive. The screenplay is riddled with boring and absent scenes (from Louis and Marie eating many silent breakfasts, to a complete lack of what was going on outside the palace walls). The end of Marie's life is run through in slipshod fashion, as if a race were on to finish the movie on schedule.Then, of course, there's the music. Incorporating modern day music with historical elements has been done before. The one that most comes to mind is A KNIGHT'S TALE. Although not the pinnacle of film success, A Knight's Tale had some catchy tunes that went along nicely with the story. But with Marie Antoinette, the connections are distant at best.

Some viewers are more plot and substance driven, while others are more visually oriented. This movie obviously plays to the visuals. The film is cinematically stunning; the French landscape, the set design and the costumes are gorgeous beyond belief. If nothing else, this 2 hour and 3 minute romp through pre-revolutionary France will delight your senses to an array of color, texture and architectural wonder you'll long remember. For that it's worthy of at least 3 Stars.But what about plot and substance, is there any? The movie plays like a period piece on the lives of the rich and famous, however there are some good moments sprinkled in here and there. There are several charming and whimsical scenes concerning Marie's need to permanently establish her aristocratic standing by becoming pregnant and Louie's hesitation, lack of interest, or inability to consummate the marriage. There is also the presence of the constant, idle chatter amongst the bored, nobly born patrons of the King's Court that helps maintain your interest for awhile as the ill-defined plot lumbers to its eventual conclusion.Do I recommend this film?

Like her previous movie, ""Lost In Translation"", it has its detractors, but I really can't understand the criticisms.  Each of her movies are less about a typical and cliched ""a"" to ""b"" storyline, but are more character studies in which the subjects are allowed to exist in their own worlds without the audience being guided or manipulated into feeling either good or bad towards the subjects.In ""Marie Antoinette"", Marie is shown experiencing all aspects of high society France of the 18th century.  She makes a number of choices which arise from situations she is put into and the movie is careful not to make its own commentary as to whether they are good or bad choices.  Because of this, and despite her unflattering historical reputation, I felt some sympathy for Marie Antoinette because the movie made me realize that she was just a person, like any other, and it is not for me to judge her.  Other viewers may have a different impression, and it is completely left up to them to decide on their own.Of course, any movie that has Marie Antoinette as its subject matter must address the famous ""Let Them Eat Cake"" line and the way it's handled here is near perfect.

I would have rather seen another full hour of film tacked onto this film that showed the downward spiral of Marie Antoinette. According to history she became haggard, and lost the will to live.

CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[2, 3]","When your father directed The Godfather and Apocalypse Now, and is an executive producer of your film, and you've just won an Oscar for your last film, Lost in Translation (2003), I guess that gives you carte blanche to film a costume drama about Marie-Antoinette on location in Versailles. At least until they boo it at Cannes. It is after midnight and your coach has turned into a pumpkin. Good luck getting your next project green-lighted.--------------Marie-Antoinette: It's not too much, is it?L&eacute;onard: Oh, no!==========For me a telling moment was in the bonus footage where they showed Sofia's daddy saying his daughter came to him for advice and he said something like ""Just think of it like you're throwing a Marie-Antoinette party."" The film was very much like a Marie-Antoinette party, but what a hangover the next morning, cleaning up the mess.--------------Marie-Antoinette: Letting everyone down would be my greatest unhappiness.==========I liked some things in Marie Antoinette a lot, so let me mention some of them: I liked the cast and the location. I liked the costumes and the art direction. Sofia Coppola had Spanish footwear designer Manolo Blahnik create hundreds of specially made shoes for the film; and Ladur&eacute;e was chosen to make all of the brightly colored pastries and cakes. It was a period drama with great attention to detail, yet with a contemporary twist--a pair of blue Converse tennis shoes was deliberately left in one scene to make the connection that Marie-Antoinette was like a typical teenager. The soundtrack featured post punk 80's music like Bow Wow Wow's cover of Bo Diddley's ""I Want Candy"" The Cure's ""Plainsong"" and Adam Ant, who by the way, modeled a lot of his stage costumes on the Louis the XIV look. Sofia returned the favor when she based the look of Count Axel von Fersen (Jamie Dornan), one of Marie-Antoinette's lovers, on Adam Ant.A Marie-Antoinette with punk rock black lipstick says the famous quote attributed to her ""Let them eat cake!"" but then, the ""real"" Marie-Antoinette, sans the black lipstick, denies that she would ever say something so callous. Indeed, the not-so-hidden agenda of Marie Antoinette, the film by Sofia Coppola, was to show the human side to the doomed monarch.This is where I stopped liking the film. Not that I object to the idea of making Marie-Antoinette sympathetic per se, I just think that the film did not accomplish this feat. Perhaps she also wanted to show that in spite of all the lavish parties, life at Versailles could be pretty boring. At two hours plus (that seemed like much, much more), she accomplished that. I fell asleep trying to watch it three nights in a row. And after using up all that time, she didn't really manage to tell what was going on. There was one cryptic scene where a portrait of Marie-Antoinette and her family was moved into a sparsely furnished hallway. Then moved again. What was the point? Was someone painted over or added? What? The birth of her first child, a daughter, was shown, but later, as she is forced to leave Versailles by an angry mob, she has more children. With all the emphasis on her producing an heir it seems like Sofia could have mentioned something about their births. As a story teller she went off on so many tangents, burning up over two hours of time, but neglected the basic plot.--------------Marie-Antoinette: So, I hear you like to make keys as a hobby?Louis XVI: Yes.Marie-Antoinette: And do you enjoy making keys?Louis XVI: Obviously.==========Jason Schwartzman as Louis XVI did his job--being the most boring person to ever sit on the throne of France. Judy Davis, Rip Torn, Asia Argento, Molly Shannon, Shirley Henderson, Danny Huston, and Steve Coogan are all very talented, but their talents were largely wasted here.

648300,A278AF56R7J86,B00005JPAS,"C. Crockett ""Domino713""","[7, 11]","Marie Antoinette is a name etched in infamy, and the woman who owned the name was deserving of that legendary iconic status...if not necessarily for the right reasons.This film follows Marie Antoinette through her life's journey, starting with her betrothal and marriage to the Dauphin of France, and ending with the fall of Versaille. As the preview to the film suggests, she was married at 15, a Queen by 19, and a legend by 20.Sofia Coppola takes the life story of Marie Antoinette and absolutely infuses it with a breathtaking style that will resonate with todays youthful generation, despite the fact that they might not usually enjoy a period piece. The film is almost good enough to eat! The color palette is exquisite, and the extravagant surroundings were the tone for this film, which is not so much of an exact account of history as it is a decadent retelling through the vision of writer/director Sofia Coppola.The movie was filmed almost entirely at Versaille and the surrounding areas of France, which is incredible since films such as this are very rarely shot in the location they are meant to depict. I believe that during a 'making of' featurette, it was said that this was the first time Versaille opened it's door to allow a movie to be filmed within it's own walls!Coppola utilizes a unique choice in music to accompany the action of the film. Though the movie starts out sombre, with the expected orchestra music traditional with period films, it then transitions slowly into modern day music as the character of Antoinette grows in life and experiences.The movie has a few noteworthy special features. The ""making of"" featurette is very interesting, and it does a great job at giving the audience an idea of what it was like to shoot this film. There are also two deleted scenes that are pre-empted by a written detailed paragraph (from Sofia Coppola) that explains the reasons why each scene was removed from the overall film. One of the most interesting special feature is one in which Jason Schwartzman (King Louis XVI)walks around the palace of Versaille, in full character and wardrobe, and gives a tour as if he were doing an episode of MTV's 'Cribs'!A bit of a sticking point for most people might be that in this instance, Sofia Coppola chose to end the film before Marie Antoinette is beheaded, which makes the ending a little anti-climactic. I understand that she was trying to make the audience think about the *woman*, what she went through, and how she might have felt -- instead of just sitting there waiting for her to get her head chopped off. The way it ends, it almost has sort of a happy ending in the sense that they were beaten and down, but they still had hope.And for the record...Marie Antoinette never uttered the words ""Let them eat cake"" in response to the growing starvation and unrest among the French people.Bottom Line, I could write all night about the incredible things in this film, but you'll just have to see it for yourself. I will say that afterwards I had a sudden craving for pink pastries...",5,A Gorgeous Exercise in Stylistic Decadence...Let Them Eat Cake!,1170979200,"02 9, 2007",2007,3055,"['Marie', 'Antoinette', 'name', 'etched', 'infamy', 'woman', 'who', 'owned', 'name', 'was', 'deserving', 'legendary', 'iconic', 'status', 'not', 'necessarily', 'right', 'reasons.This', 'film', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'life', 'journey', 'starting', 'betrothal', 'marriage', 'Dauphin', 'France', 'ending', 'fall', 'Versaille', 'preview', 'film', 'was', 'married', '15', 'Queen', '19', 'legend', '20.Sofia', 'Coppola', 'life', 'story', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'absolutely', 'breathtaking', 'style', 'will', 'resonate', 'todays', 'youthful', 'generation', 'fact', 'might', 'not', 'usually', 'enjoy', 'period', 'piece', 'film', 'almost', 'good', 'enough', 'eat', 'color', 'palette', 'exquisite', 'extravagant', 'surroundings', 'were', 'tone', 'film', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'exact', 'account', 'history', 'decadent', 'retelling', 'vision', 'writer/director', 'Sofia', 'Coppola.The', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'almost', 'entirely', 'Versaille', 'surrounding', 'areas', 'France', 'incredible', 'films', 'such', 'are', 'very', 'rarely', 'shot', 'location', 'are', 'meant', 'depict', 'believe', ""'making"", 'featurette', 'was', 'said', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'Versaille', 'opened', 'door', 'allow', 'movie', 'be', 'filmed', 'own', 'walls', 'Coppola', 'unique', 'choice', 'music', 'accompany', 'action', 'film', 'movie', 'out', 'sombre', 'expected', 'orchestra', 'music', 'traditional', 'period', 'films', 'then', 'slowly', 'modern', 'day', 'music', 'character', 'Antoinette', 'grows', 'life', 'experiences.The', 'movie', 'few', 'noteworthy', 'special', 'features', 'making', 'featurette', 'very', 'interesting', 'great', 'job', 'giving', 'audience', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'shoot', 'film', 'are', 'also', 'two', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'pre-empted', 'written', 'detailed', 'paragraph', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'reasons', 'why', 'scene', 'was', 'removed', 'overall', 'film', 'One', 'most', 'interesting', 'special', 'feature', 'one', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'King', 'Louis', 'XVI', 'walks', 'palace', 'Versaille', 'full', 'character', 'wardrobe', 'tour', 'were', 'doing', 'episode', 'MTV', ""'Cribs"", 'bit', 'sticking', 'point', 'most', 'people', 'might', 'be', 'instance', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'chose', 'end', 'film', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'beheaded', 'ending', 'little', 'anti-climactic', 'understand', 'was', 'trying', 'make', 'audience', 'think', '*woman*', 'what', 'went', 'how', 'might', 'have', 'felt', 'instead', 'just', 'sitting', 'there', 'waiting', 'get', 'head', 'chopped', 'off', 'way', 'almost', 'sort', 'happy', 'ending', 'sense', 'were', 'beaten', 'down', 'still', 'had', 'hope.And', 'record', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'never', 'uttered', 'words', 'Let', 'eat', 'cake', 'response', 'growing', 'starvation', 'unrest', 'French', 'people.Bottom', 'Line', 'could', 'write', 'night', 'incredible', 'things', 'film', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'see', 'will', 'say', 'afterwards', 'had', 'sudden', 'craving', 'pink', 'pastries']",Marie Antoinette

648302,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B00005JPAS,Chris Pandolfi,"[9, 16]","I couldn't get through ten minutes of ""Marie Antoinette"" without questioning what the point was. It certainly wasn't to tell a historically accurate story; despite the bold set and costume designs, the sparse moments of dialogue were completely modern, and the film's soundtrack made use of recent pop songs. That didn't really bother me, considering that many well-made period films have been very inaccurate. Maybe then the point was to portray the title character in a different light, one that would reveal how misunderstood she was in real life. If that was the intention, then something went wrong; I left the theater feeling no more enlightened than I did upon entering. Rather than delve into the complexities of Marie's mind, the film focuses on the rituals and traditions that were common in eighteenth century Europe. It was interesting, yes, but it didn't feel personal enough, and it did little if anything to help me understand the real Marie Antoinette.No wonder this movie is a mess; it was written and directed by Sofia Coppola, who completely missed the mark in 2003 with the grossly overrated ""Lost in Translation."" Both films prove that her writing style simply doesn't work (and I think it's about time someone told her so). In the case of ""Marie Antoinette,"" we're presented with a story that goes absolutely nowhere, with each cut marking the end of yet another flat, bloodless scene. It doesn't help that half of the actors are miscast, including Rip Torn as Louis XV and Molly Shannon as a snobbish gossip-freak. Because of that, the style and emphasis they give their characters are way off track. Adding insult to injury are the film's unbearable pacing and length. I can't recall the last time I've been this bored watching a movie; I needed a jolt of caffeine by the middle just to keep from nodding off.And then there's Marie Antoinette herself, played with girlish innocence by Kirsten Dunst. I didn't feel as if I had the chance to explore her character fully; she felt shallow and unrefined, as if Dunst wasn't interested in the role. There's a wealth of things to see on the surface, such as laughter, tears, and the rebellious need to party and gamble in the midst of sophisticated royalty. Historically, it's easy to understand her behavior; in 1770, at the tender age of fourteen, she's arranged to marry Louis XVI, the Dauphin of France (Jason Schwartzman). This required her to leave her native Austria, not just physically, but emotionally, as well, casting aside all traces of her previous life (including her clothes, her friends, and her dog). Such a transition is understandably difficult for a teenager, considering she now has to take on responsibilities that a lot of adults aren't ready for.This alone was good material for to Coppola to work with, and it's a shame she used it without giving much thought to Marie. The best we're initially given is the occasional critique of how ridiculous some of the royal rituals are, such as having lower-ranking royalty dress her in the morning. We also have some tense moments between her and Louis, with the pressure to produce an heir weighing heavily upon them. But Louis is incredibly shy, pretty much to the point of ignoring her. Here's a character that didn't require a lot of effort; he's a quiet, detached young man who spends most of his time looking down. With such a passive attitude, you'd think Schwartzman could have perfected the role. He didn't. Truth be told, he completely ruined it. I've rarely seen an actor give less for a performance; he was an emotionless drone who didn't act so much as he read his lines.How could such a flat performance help an already weak film? The reality is that it can't. This is bad because the more serious portions of the story begin to pile up. For one thing, Marie isn't getting along with Madame du Barry (Asia Argento), Louis XV's mistress and a former prostitute. But more importantly, Marie and her husband have not been successful in the bedroom, with her attempts at initiating sexual contact flatly rejected (it's historically known that their marriage wasn't consummated for about seven years, and the audience is shown this during some incredibly repetitive scenes). Marie's mother, Maria Teresa (Marianne Faithful), is convinced that her daughter isn't ""inspiring"" him enough, and she continuously writes her letters of concern. Apparently, the future Queen of France can't be taken seriously unless she's pregnant.All of these ideas would have worked had Dunst not been directed to be so unflatteringly dull; even some elaborately shot party sequences didn't do much to enhance her screen presence. The material excess is shown to the fullest during these scenes, not the least of which come in the form of little pastries that Marie can't get enough of. She drinks champagne by the bottle. She wears dresses made of the finest materials. She even plays casino-type games with her friends, laughing the entire time. These moments are rich in visuals, yet they're completely hollow in spirit. There's no substance to what we're watching; there's only the illusion that an important story is being told.It isn't until the last half hour of the film that Marie becomes interesting, and by then it's too late. Such a pity: that's when she speaks a majority of her dialogue (before then, she couldn't have gotten more than ten lines in). Many years have passed and now she has children, all of whom she loves dearly (the film establishes early on how comfortable she is around children). Slowly her life comes to revolve around the need to be herself. She has her husband build her a sanctuary where she can be a mother as well as a free spirit, complete with a guesthouse, a vegetable garden, and some animals to take care of (lambs, chickens, ducks, etc.). She's the happiest during these scenes, and from the audience's point of view, she feels more like a complete character and less like a sketch. That level of complexity should have been there from the very beginning; at least then it wouldn't have been so excruciating to sit through to the end.And what of the end? The ultimate fate of the real Marie Antoinette is well known, but even then, I found that the final scenes of this film adaptation lacked something. Historically, we know that the people of France came to hate her for her constant spending (not helped by her husband's financial support of the American Revolution). But the film pays such little attention to this that it virtually voids the entire idea; just because Marie was sheltered from the realities of daily life didn't mean that the audience had to be. I wanted so much more from ""Marie Antoinette."" I wanted complexity. I wanted intensity. I wanted some kernel of knowledge about the main character to be planted in my brain. It didn't deliver; Sofia Coppola directed an empty, uninteresting film, one that is neither entertaining nor insightful. Much like the operators of the guillotine, I say off with its head.",2,Let Them Eat Fake,1161993600,"10 28, 2006",2006,6998,"['could', ""n't"", 'get', 'ten', 'minutes', 'Marie', 'Antoinette',

Sure, it was cool to see the lavish palace of Versailles, and the obnoxiously opulant clothing and food that the nobility of France enjoyed. However, I was let down by the fact that the movie had NO POINT to it! It was like going to a dumb party full of shallow Hollywooders, and then all of a sudden the party is over and the credits start rolling!This absurd film did not even show the true side of 18th century France: destitute, starving, Ethiopian-looking peasants with little to hope for, since their greedy noble caretakers like Marie Antoinette were taxing them to death. While Antoinette and her ilk were living ritzy lifestyles, the REAL PEOPLE of France were opening the door to revolution, to freedom--well, freedom from the old monarchy, anyway.Today, every 14th of July is celebrated as France's independence day, when the common people raided the Bastille. This sorry movie never even showed a crowd of peasants storming the famous fortress. NOTHING HAPPENED!But why should I have gotten my hopes up? I should have realized why this film gave a sympathetic portrait of the tramp Antoinette, and not the 98% of the French people who were seeking freedom from tyranny she symbolized. It is becasue Marie Antoinette symbolizes today's shallow nobility: Hollywooders! Based on their movies like this one, their whole lives are absorbed by nothing but fashion, elegant food, clothes, and sex.IF ONLY this film had not starred Spiderman's girl, but someone who truly symbolizes a modern day Marie Antoinette: Paris Hilton!",1,"No plot, no point",1191024000,"09 29, 2007",2007,1682,"['history', 'teacher', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'good', 'movie', 'mindset', 'one', 'most', 'notorious', 'woman', '18th', 'century', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'Sure', 'was', 'cool', 'see', 'lavish', 'palace', 'Versailles', 'obnoxiously', 'opulant', 'clothing', 'food', 'nobility', 'France', 'enjoyed', 'However', 'was', 'let', 'down', 'fact', 'movie', 'had', 'POINT', 'was', 'going', 'dumb', 'party', 'full', 'shallow', 'Hollywooders', 'then', 'sudden', 'party', 'credits', 'start', 'rolling', 'absurd', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'show', 'true', 'side', '18th', 'century', 'France', 'destitute', 'starving', 'Ethiopian-looking', 'peasants', 'little', 'hope', 'greedy', 'noble', 'caretakers', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'were', 'taxing', 'death', 'Antoinette', 'ilk', 'were', 'living', 'ritzy', 'lifestyles', 'REAL', 'PEOPLE', 'France', 'were', 'opening', 'door', 'revolution', 'freedom', 'well', 'freedom', 'old', 'monarchy', 'anyway.Today', '14th', 'July', 'celebrated', 'France', 'independence', 'day', 'when', 'common', 'people', 'raided', 'Bastille', 'sorry', 'movie', 'never', 'even', 'showed', 'crowd', 'peasants', 'storming', 'famous', 'fortress', 'NOTHING', 'HAPPENED', 'why', 'should', 'have', 'gotten', 'hopes', 'should', 'have', 'realized', 'why', 'film', 'gave', 'sympathetic', 'portrait', 'tramp', 'Antoinette', 'not', '98', '%', 'French', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'seeking', 'freedom', 'tyranny', 'symbolized', 'becasue', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'today', 'shallow', 'nobility', 'Hollywooders', 'Based', 'movies', 'one', 'whole', 'lives', 'are', 'absorbed', 'nothing', 'fashion', 'elegant', 'food', 'clothes', 'ONLY', 'film', 'had', 'not', 'starred', 'Spiderman', 'girl', 'someone', 'who', 'truly', 'modern', 'day', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'Paris', 'Hilton']",Marie Antoinette
648305,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B00005JPAS,"Cloud ""...""","[3, 4]","You can't really expect traditional style filmmaking when you deal with Sofia Coppola. A lot of what she does is more based on atmosphere and a serene landscape rather than being super realistic and narrative driven. It's probably because of this that the film wasn't that well received at Cannes or with most of the critics. While it's true that the film is potentially polarizing, you got to admit it's nice now and then to watch a film that actually cares about how it looks and what kind of emotions it brings out. It's like a film by Terrence Malick if he ever learned to quit pointing the camera at stuff every 20 seconds.Marie Antoinette was an Austrian member of royalty who was shipped off to France to marry Louis the XVI and provide an heir. Inexplicably Louis doesn't seem that interested in bedding the beautiful girl which is only one of many problems since she lives in a world where etiquette and protocol are the most important things. At first it's a little minor: she can't dress herself but has to wait for people to do it for her and manners in addressing the King's mistress. But pretty soon things get to her head and she gets into rockstar mode and spends a lot and parties which doesn't sit well at all with the people of France.If you're looking for a history lesson, read a book. You'll basically get the personal life and intimate details of who she was rather than getting caught up in dates and facts. There's points where you can't tell how much time has passed and have to gauge the film's timeline based on things around her such as the age of her first daughter or dialogue mentioned. But she was likely one of France's most hated queens and rampant rumors spread in France concerning her personal life, such as alleged lesbianism and sodomy. This is a look at a life who never seemed to make a right decision in people's eyes and it's a fascinating look at someone thought to be unbelievably reviled.One of the more controversial things about the film is the use of a more comtemporary soundtrack, with songs from artists like the Strokes, the Cure and Siouxsie and the Banshees. Sometimes, such as the case of the Cure's majestic chording in ""Plainsong"" announcing Louis XVI becoming the next King of France and at times there's almost a rock backing with drums and guitar and it works great but then you have the opening credits set to a punk song and the Strokes on here, it just sounds a bit misguided. Certain ideas like the Cure work but other ones didn't work at all and it's a bit of a fumble.While music-wise it's a little iffy, this is certainly a dreamy kind of film. From the immaculate set design and costuming to the cinematography whenever they actually go outside which is very little is quite stunning. That's one of the things I always liked about this Coppola's movies is that she does know how to frame and point a camera but one brief scene in a garden Marie Antoinette had made had too much of a Virgin Suicides look to it. But regardless this is certainly Sofia's most ambitious looking film and thankfully it delivers. The pacing might throw people, the modern soundtrack might be too distracting but you gotta admit it's a lush looking film.On one hand, I'm disappointing by the lack of features but since Virgin Suicides or Lost in Translation weren't that packed, I guess it's a director thing. But if you're a fan of this film, and be warned that not everyone will; it's serviceable for a film that'll confuse for some and seduce others.",4,A dreamy and different piece of cinema,1171411200,"02 14, 2007",2007,3500,"['ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'expect', 'traditional', 'style', 'filmmaking', 'when', 'deal', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'lot', 'what', 'more', 'based', 'atmosphere', 'serene', 'landscape', 'rather', 'being', 'super', 'realistic', 'narrative', 'driven', 'probably', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'that', 'well', 'received', 'Cannes', 'most', 'critics', 'true', 'film', 'potentially', 'polarizing', 'got', 'admit', 'nice', 'now', 'then', 'watch', 'film', 'actually', 'how', 'what', 'kind', 'emotions', 'out', 'film', 'Terrence', 'Malick', 'ever', 'learned', 'quit', 'pointing', 'camera', 'stuff', '20', 'seconds.Marie', 'Antoinette', 'was', 'Austrian', 'member', 'royalty', 'who', 'was', 'shipped', 'off', 'France', 'marry', 'Louis', 'XVI', 'provide', 'heir', 'Inexplicably', 'Louis', ""n't"", 'seem', 'interested', 'bedding', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'only', 'one', 'many', 'problems', 'world', 'where', 'etiquette', 'protocol', 'are', 'most', 'important', 'things', 'first', 'little', 'minor', 'ca', ""n't"", 'dress', 'wait', 'people', 'do', 'manners', 'addressing', 'King', 'mistress', 'pretty', 'soon', 'things', 'get', 'head', 'rockstar', 'mode', 'lot', 'parties', ""n't"", 'sit', 'well', 'people', 'France.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'history', 'lesson', 'read', 'book', ""'ll"", 'basically', 'get', 'personal', 'life', 'intimate', 'details', 'who', 'was', 'rather', 'getting', 'caught', 'up', 'dates', 'facts', 'points', 'where', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'how', 'much', 'time', 'passed', 'have', 'gauge', 'film', 'timeline', 'based', 'things', 'such', 'age', 'first', 'daughter', 'dialogue', 'mentioned', 'was', 'likely', 'one', 'France', 'most', 'hated', 'queens', 'rampant', 'rumors', 'spread', 'France', 'concerning', 'personal', 'life', 'such', 'alleged', 'lesbianism', 'sodomy', 'look', 'life', 'who', 'never', 'seemed', 'make', 'right', 'decision', 'people', 'eyes', 'fascinating', 'look', 'someone', 'thought', 'be', 'unbelievably', 'reviled.One', 'more', 'controversial', 'things', 'film', 'use', 'more', 'comtemporary', 'soundtrack', 'songs', 'artists', 'Strokes', 'Cure', 'Siouxsie', 'Banshees', 'Sometimes', 'such', 'case', 'Cure', 'majestic', 'chording', 'Plainsong', 'announcing', 'Louis', 'XVI', 'becoming', 'next', 'King', 'France', 'times', 'almost', 'rock', 'backing', 'drums', 'guitar', 'great', 'then', 'have', 'opening', 'credits', 'set', 'punk', 'song', 'Strokes', 'here', 'just', 'bit', 'misguided', 'Certain', 'ideas', 'Cure', 'work', 'other', 'ones', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'bit', 'fumble.While', 'music-wise', 'little', 'iffy', 'certainly', 'dreamy', 'kind', 'film', 'immaculate', 'set', 'design', 'costuming', 'cinematography', 'whenever', 'actually', 'go', 'outside', 'very', 'little', 'quite', 'stunning', 'one', 'things', 'always', 'liked', 'Coppola', 'movies', 'know', 'how', 'frame', 'point', 'camera', 'one', 'brief', 'scene', 'garden', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'had', 'made', 'had', 'too', 'much', 'Virgin', 'Suicides', 'look', 'regardless', 'certainly', 'Sofia', 'most', 'ambitious', 'looking', 'film', 'thankfully', 'pacing', 'might', 'throw', 'people', 'modern', 'soundtrack', 'might', 'be', 'too', 'distracting', 'got', 'ta', 'lush', 'looking', 'film.On', 'one', 'hand', ""'m"", 'disappointing', 'lack', 'features', 'Virgin', 'Suicides', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'were', ""n't"", 'packed', 'guess', 'director', 'thing', ""'re"", 'fan', 'film', 'be', 'warned', 'not', 'everyone', 'will', 'serviceable', 'film', ""'ll"", 'confuse', 'seduce', 'others']",Marie Antoinette
648306,A1T17LMQABMBN5,B00005JPAS,CoffeeGurl,"[0, 0]","Sofia Coppola has created quite an interesting film about Marie Antoinette.  She has mixed a story based on the life of this fascinating historical figure with modern rock music and that seems to make parallels with Marie Antoiniette's life with that of modern-day celebrities.  After all, she was quite frivolous at some point -- spending astronomical amounts of money on jewelry and clothes, having lavish parties and being the focus of vicious gossip (like the whole, ""Let them eat cake!"" misquote).  When put into that context, I suppose Marie Antoinette's life was not all that different from a famous person from the 21st century.  This film does paint a more sympathetic look into the young queen's life with her struggles with giving King Louis XVI's an heir.  This film implies that he had been the one to blame, for he had no sexual appetite, but it was never proven whose fault it was, or if indeed there was someone to blame.  Historically, it does address some of the things the queen went through -- like having to relinquish her Austrian roots, getting dressed every morning by her ladies-in-waiting, the king's insatiable appetite for food, and many of the things that led to the French Revolution.  However, this film felt extremely rushed at the end and I didn't like the fact that there was nothing shown about her tragic demise when she was beheaded for supposedly committing treason. That is not to say that the film isn't great.  Kirsten Dunst did a wonderful job with the title role.  She brought in Marie's innocent and frivolous side as well as the more human, vulnerable side.  I was impressed with her delivery.  The film is also a feast for the eyes.  I loved the period costumes and the scenery.  I love everything about the 18th century except for the men's powdered wigs.  Marie Antoinette is an artful film that takes some rather risky artistic license that manage to work well with the overall tone.  However, I would have liked to see more of her during the last stages of her life.  I know this isn't a biopic in the classic sense, but I nevertheless would have liked to see how this interesting woman's story translated into film.  The DVD is okay.

648308,AQCQ5F0OJXMG9,B00005JPAS,Crystal Starr Light,"[5, 6]","For quite some time, this movie has been on my to-view list.  So when I was perusing the library, I checked it out.  And then my sister and I watched it.  And then I found out why I hadn't viewed it earlier.The plot (well, what there is of a plot) can be summed up in one sentence: See Marie Antoinette live extravagantly.  Marie Antoinette marries into the French Court, goes to Versailles, spends lots of money, and basically lounges around.Before I swing the axe on this film, let me detail some of the highlights.  Beautiful scenery and costumes.  I found out it won an Academy Award for costume design, and I believe it was well-earned.  The costumes looked accurate (my sister is taking art history and, for the most part, found the film to be fairly accurate in this regard) and appropriate for the time period.  The surroundings were, I found out, actually filmed in Versailles.  Kudos to whomever was able to procure that, as it looks very gorgeous and realistic.But other than eye candy, there really isn't anything to this movie.  Kirsten Dunst does a so-so performance as the doomed Austrian queen of France.  One thing is certain: while she may not look the part of a 18th century French royalty, she can play vacuous well.  But then all she had to really do to sell that part is throw dice, try on shoes, sip champagne, or eat pastries.  Jason Schwartzmann was very amusing as her husband, and I felt he did okay, but, when he isn't given much to act with (other than riding away or falling asleep), you can't quite get a feeling.  Most of the actors (Asia Argento, Rose Byrne, Rip Torn, the woman who played Marie's mother)  were okay...but there was so little script, it was hard to hail their performances as anything extraordinary.A brief glance at Wikipedia showed that the historical accuracy was moderately high for a Hollywood film, but I bemoan the loss of the French Revolution.  Where are the political machinations?  Where are the destitute people in the streets?  Why wasn't more mention made of Marie's village or her increasing interest in politics or on how much money she spent?  These are very important parts to Marie's life; parts that are glaringly missing.And the ending!  I might have given this 3 stars, but the conclusion, the blankess you are left with...horrible!  No idea is given what happens to Marie Antoinette after leaving Versailles...only an empty palace bedroom.  How can you call this a story of Marie Antoinette when you only see a few sparse years of her life, during which all she does is gamble and shop?  If you aren't going to end with her on the guillotine, at least give us some idea as to her fate!Overall, I am not impressed.  I do credit the film with generating in me an interest in the real Marie Antoinette's life, but other than that and some pretty surroundings and costumes, there really isn't anything to this film.  View only if you're in the mood for some petit fours and be prepared for an upset stomach afterwards.Brought to you by:*C.S.

However, Coppola's disregard for making her audience understand and feel for Marie made this movie boring and trite.  I never once felt like I could identify with any character.  All of them seemed emotionally removed from the film.  I could understand how this would play up to the characterization of the time, but it was poorly done nonetheless.The movie is pretentious and overdone.  It was trying too hard to be aloof and cold, yet visually stunning.  The visuals remind me of a Pleasures perfume commercial--okay for a commercial, but not so good for a movie (to see this hazy, romantic cinematography done well, try the 2005 Pride and Prejudice with Keira Knightley).  Understanding Marie and Louis's demise was difficult.  Understanding Marie's true feelings was also difficult.I did not mind the soundtrack, I actually enjoy it.

648312,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,B00005JPAS,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[0, 1]","Sophia Coppola is quickly becoming one of my favorite directors for her style is one all her own, and one that is so unique and revolutionary that it cowers over most directors today. With her third film Sophia brought us a modern twist on the true life story of the Austrian born Queen of France, Marie Antoinette. Shedding almost a comedic light on this heartbreaking story Sophia was able the deliver a once in a lifetime film, a grand spectacle of entertainment that is bound to be this years `Moulin Rouge', a film to be loved or hated...there's no in between. I, as you can tell, am a lover not a hater.As Marie, Dunst is at her grandest, embodying her character mind body and soul. When we are first introduced to Marie she is fourteen years of age and being given away in marriage to the heir to the French throne, Louis XVI (Schwartzman), in order to establish an allied bond between Austria and France. Dunst gives us the emotions, not of an adult in her situation but of a young girl, intrigued and excited about her current situation as well as confused and alarmed by what she doesn't know. The whole scene where she is to lose everything Austrian, including her beloved dog, says it all. Marie soon learns to adjust to the ways of her new people, the strange customs, the constant back-biting and gossiping, the cake, the parties, the shoes...but the one thing she's unable to grow accustom to is her husbands complete lack of interest in her. Under constant pressure from her new country, as well as her mother, to produce an heir to solidify the union of the two country's Marie is constantly haunted and distressed by her inability to do so.Marie seems to immerse herself in the parties and gambling and trips to Paris in order to forget her state but it eventually causes her to fall out of favor with the country as a whole that in turn blame her for the nation's debt and insist on her execution. As the now Queen of France she became known as the Scapegoat Queen. She was beheaded in order to appease the country who blamed her for their current situation, wherefore the film subtly sheds light on the fact that there where other reasons for the country's current lack of funds.`Marie Antoinette' though focuses on the woman that was Marie Antoinette and not the tragedy that befell her. In fact the film ends before her historical beheading but instead opts to end right as the country turns its back on her. This is symbolized first by their refusal to clap along with her (in the beginning of the film we see that it's not customary to clap after a opera but Marie, who feels they deserve it, convinces the crowd to clap), and then confirmed when they crowd outside her residence with pitchforks and torches chanting for her execution. The film plays out more like a fairy tale, giving us the Paris Hilton of the royal courts, with extravagant hair and of course a lap dog.One downfall or I guess I should say pet peeve was the fact that the cast was so extensive yet so under used. Other than Kirsten Dunst the cast barely spoke and the characters where barely examined or explained. That just further goes to show what the main objective of this film was to do. It's here to let us know the woman, not the situation. Actors like Danny Huston and Asia Argento get brief screen time, and then supporting players like Judy Davis and Jason Schwartzman barely stand out in comparison to Dunst's riveting performance. Jason plays France's new king with such inexperience and dread that you almost feel bad for his character...he comes across like a little boy. The scene where he's being convinced to help the American armies just goes to show his lack of experience and almost lack of interest in his new responsibilities.As a whole I was very impressed with this film. Sophia was able to harness what makes her such a brilliant director and deliver to us a one of a kind biopic that has never been done before and in that sense has never been accomplished to wonderfully. Dunst delivers one of her finest performances to date (Sophia definitely brings out the best in Dunst for her performance in `Virgin Suicides' was a definite Oscar snub) and will hopefully become this years Knightly for her performance was enough parts humor, enough parts drama and ample parts charm to at least get her in the runnings for an Oscar nomination.

With this film and ""The Virgin Suicides"" and ""Lost in Translation""(which I didn't get) Sofia is not yet on equal footing as her father but she has established herself as a talent to be reckoned with.  ""Marie Antoinette"" is not a great film but most certainly it's an interesting one.  The intent here is to portray the notorious Queen of France in a sympathetic light.  The film follows her from the time she was a callow teenager born of Austrian nobility forced into a loveless marriage of convenience to the Dauphin of France till her inevitable fate with the guillotine.  Kirsten Dunst, always a formidable actress, probably gives her best performance ever in portraying the evolution of her character.  Jason Schwartzmann, in what could have been a totally unsympathetic role, engenders some empathy for Louis.  The great Rip Torn gives a lusty turn as the King of France.  The decor is sumptuous and the Oscar winning costumes are breathtaking.  The film's lone glaring debit is the intermittent use of latter day pop music.

Kirsten Dunst, who plays the title role, is also a very beautiful and somewhat accomplished (two Spidermans; Eternal Sunshine; no doubt some others I haven't seen) actress that's becoming one of my favorites of her generation (along with the wonderful Natalie Portman).  Jason Schartzman, who plays the Dauphin Louis-Auguste and then King Louis, was terrific in ""Rushmore"".Directed by Sofia Coppola (Lost in Translation), ""Marie Antoinette"" is much more of a visual experience than a plot-driven story.  Marie, a princess in her own right in Austria, arrives at the Court of France as a 15-year old promised to Dauphin Louis-Auguste, a sluggish boy of 16 with a passion for locksmithing.  She tries her best to ingratiate herself to Louis, to adjust to the attentions of the court, and eventually to enjoy all that is available.The movie features the most fantastic depiction of desserts ever filmed (at least for a Hollywood production) and also some of the most outlandish hairdos (many of which resemble pastries).  However, once she becomes mother to a dauphine and the long-awaited new dauphin, Marie becomes more serious about her role, to the extent that this is possible in the hothouse of Versailles.  Dunst is brilliant as the young, confused and eventually giddy Marie; she struggles somewhat with the more serious depiction near the end---perhaps that's intentional to convey Marie's actual struggle in the situation.Schwartzman was disappointingly flat as Louis--I think that the writers and Coppola could have made better use of this talented actor.  There's also some heavy innuendo (and a little more) about Marie's relationship with a Swedish soldier (and perhaps the fatherhood of the dauphin) which I've read is not well-supported by history, though it adds a note of tension to the story.Most memorable are the scenes where we watch Marie attended to by 15 or 20 courtiers, led by Judi Davis (each with a particular role, determined by seniority) as she rises in the morning, and the even larger group in attendance as she delivers the couple's first child.  Talk about needing privacy.  We also enjoyed seeing the mini-palace and country ""cottage"" that Louis had built for Marie after the birth of each child.  We saw the palace and walk the cottage grounds (it was a working farm of sorts) when we visited last year.A little offputting, probably for me moreso than younger viewers, is Coppola's use of modern pop music in the score.  My thought all along was that Mozart and others wrote some beautiful music that would have fit the scene better and sounded just as good.  Still, I guess she felt she needed more of a hook to younger audiences than the appearance of Dunst.  To Coppola's credit, she ends the film well short of depicting the historical end for the King and Queen of France; another plus for young viewers.

Mostly modern music peppered throughout this movie to cover up the lack of a story. The cinematography was outstanding, scenic from start to finish, but there was just no story. What little dialog there was could barely be heard over the music much of the time, and often was just snippets of moments in time that really didn't seem to have anything to do with the anything else, I can't say story I failed to find one.I'm not going to get into all the historical errors, as the movie isn't a historic biopic if it was, it failed splendidly. The story was choppy and the overall acting sub-par to the point it was difficult to follow at times. It's nothing but eye candy and nothing for the brain. If they spent a fraction of what they spent on set design, on a script they might have had something. I think it tried to be ""Knights Tale"" with the modern music and ""Amadeus"" with the rich texture, but lacked the story that those had in spades.I really wanted to like this movie, but I just couldn't. If it wasn't for the color and richness of the cinematography of this movie, I would have likely turned it off.

648322,A280GY5UVUS2QH,B00005JPAS,Doug Anderson,"[82, 106]","There are actually several Marie Antoinette biographies out there that paint Marie Antoinette in a sympathetic light. This film is based on one of those biographies written by Antonia Fraser. But the film is by no means a faithful transcription of Fraser's biography to screen; in fact Antonia Fraser has gone on record as saying that the Marie Antoinette of Sofia Coppola's film is not the Marie Antoinette of her biography. What you get in Sofia Coppola's film is a character that is largely the product of Sofia Coppola's imagination which means among other things that this film is a very personal take on this historical figure.At times it seems Sofia Coppola seems to want us to see her Marie Antoinette as a product of her cultural context but at other times it  seems that Coppola wants to radically decontextualize this figure and allow us to see that the distance between 18th century France and our cultural context is not that great. On the one hand we are invited to observe Marie Antoinette as she was put on display before the courts of her time and on the other hand we are invited to see Marie Antoinette with her gaurd down behind the scenes in the personal space of her bedroom. While most people will not be able to relate with Marie Antoinette's royal upbringing and lifestyle most people will be able to relate with the fact that there is a great distance between Marie Antoinette's public and private lives because all of us have at one time or another felt the great disparity that exists between social formalities and decorums and our natural selves. Most of us treasure our privacy and value time spent alone as the most important time of the day but Marie Antoinette is caught in a world where she has virtually no privacy. In fact her most private moments are what interest the court and the public the most. Hence her private life is not really private at all. Being deprived of personal space at a time in her life when she needs it the most (early teen years) is something that Marie Antoinette never gets used to and even if we can't relate to every aspect of her life we can certainly relate to this. There are really several moments in Marie Antoinette's life that are presented in ways that allow us to identify with her: her search for a confidante, her wish to express her own identity, her first feelings of love. By focusing less on Marie Antoinette the royal and more on Marie Antoinette the teen Sofia Coppola offers her audience a figure that they can relate with and even like. As personable as this character is, however, we are only allowed a very limited access to her. Though we see her in her private rooms all that we know of Marie Antoinette in this film is based on surfaces and appearances and appearances are always vague, always enigmatic.Certainly few films have been so thoroughly dedicated to the purely visual as Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette. Filmgoers looking for a compelling plot or character might be nonplussed by this extravagantly realized piece of visual art that shuns the usual narrative strategies of the film biography. Though we catch fleeting glimpses of Marie Antoinette both in public and in private we are kept at a distance from the real dramas that are affecting her life. On one occasion we do see her break down after visiting her brother-in-laws newborn and are thus given a glimpse of the pain she feels at not yet having conceived a child of her own but these candid moments are rare. The film does not have a lot of dialogue and we are never really allowed into Marie Antoinette's thought process. Also the film does not proceed along any particular narrative line; instead it moves in a rather impressionistic way from one thing to the next and one time span to the next, sometimes without any sort of transition, and thus theres not a lot of connective tissue linking the various scenes together. One of the advantages of this compelling near-silent anti-narrative approach is that Sofia Coppola is free to craft a portrait based not on the usual accumulation of scenes that dramatize what we already know from the historical record and existing biographical data but on an accumulation of isolated vignettes. Each vignette presents us with another angle from which to view the enigma that is Marie Antoinette even though none of these visual cues supply us with any concrete or definitive answers as to who she is. The resulting film is thus less a literal rendering of a life than an open-ended evocation. As a result it is a much freer kind of biography; one might even call it an anti-biography because the person being studied remains a mystery for the most part. This film is not for the literal minded but for those who enjoy the enigma of surfaces. This film, like the paintings of Velazquez, or Goya, or Manet offer rich but elusive surfaces to the eye; Marie Antoinette, like the faces in these paintings, looks straight at us but tells us virtually nothing or at least tells us nothing in a literal way. With Marie Antoinette Sofia Coppola is experimenting with film as a purely visual medium instead of as a medium that relies on familiar narrative forms and she effectively uses this experimental anti-narrative technique to offer a Marie Antoinette that does not fit into any of the narratives that have been told about her.This film experiments with style and invites us to examine style as an alternative language--a language of appearances--that disrupts the usual narrative forms that cinema is so fond of. If you leave behind your usual need to follow a traditional narrative and find literal meanings and allow yourself to simply gaze upon this films many polyvalent surfaces then you will be in a position to appreciate this films original approach which does not attempt to capture Marie Antionette by defining her but shows her time and again attempting to elude her captors.",4,Eluding

I doubt many people could deny that visually this film is stunning: the costume design, sets and art direction are spectacular. But the 80's soundtrack and languid, dreamy tone are sure to polarize the audience.For the most part, I thought it all worked. This film portrays Marie Antoinette as a privileged, yet controlled and smothered, teenager. Arranged to marry the prince of France, her political survival depends on her giving birth to an heir. Unfortunately, her awkward husband, for reasons that are never really clear, can't consummate their marriage. So Marie Antoinette blows off steam by enjoying her stilted life the only ways she can: by spending loads of cash, partying nonstop and, eventually, finding some sense of purpose in motherhood.Kirsten Dunst gives an understated, yet somehow charismatic, performance as the young queen.

Since I have an interest in ""historically inspired"" work and the controversy which surrounds it (think Spielberg'sAmistad, Lee'sMalcolm X, Stone'sJFKetc...), I felt compelled to watch Coppola's film. So, I released a burdensome sigh when I dropped this DVD in the player ... then, I stared at the ""two hours and two minutes"" stamp with an expression of pain. Within minutes, I was completely riveted ...Coppola's work is masterful. The mise en sc&egrave;ne is breathtaking. Coppola's design-training (always evident in her work) is in full bloom: each frame is its own work of art. (And, until now, I have never seen the garishness of Versailles as beautiful). I was charmed by the artist's attention to the most minute detail. As if taking a cue from her cinematographer forThe Virgin Suicides(Edward Lachman), Coppola uses pale pinks and blues to emphasize Marie Antoinette's innocence (although Dunst was in her twenties, remember that Marie Antoinette was a mere fourteen years-old when sent to France). After an affair with Count Fersen, the queen's  infidelity is emphasized by a scarlet belt (very clever). The lushness of the film cannot be conveyed with words ...The acting is sublime. While I have never cared for the roles into which Dunst is usually thrust (saveInterview with the VampireandThe Virgin Suicides), this role is pure perfection. Dunst brings warmth and vulnerability to a much maligned historical figure. Moreover, Schwartzman is both compelling and amusing in his role as Louis XVI ... he, too, is wildly sympathetic as a ""child-king"" (only twenty years-old) ... ""God help us. We are too young to reign.""Coppola never intended to create a work faithful to history. Why should she? Anyone can flip to The History Channel or PBS to see that. Instead,  Coppola grants us the portrait of a frightened child ... with the hopes of France and Austria pinned to her frilly dress ... trying to navigate a tangle of tradition ... very much alone.Two hours and two minutes passed in a flash of decadence and heartbreak. After viewing Coppola's junior project, I can hardly await her next film. This is a phenomenal effort and a phenomenal success.

Kirsten Dunst is a natural as the title role of Marie Antoinette, but beyond that the movie falters badly.  Even with all of the lavish sets & costumes, it simply doesn't resonate as a well done period film.  {If you're looking for a fabulous period film, albeit from a few hundred years earlier, then check outThe Tudors: The Complete Series}The focus of the film is to depict a young Austrian girl who is shipped far away from home to a country full of rude people whom she's never met before.  She marries Louis XVI, but she hardly gets the  Harlequin Romance happy ending.  She becomes homesick & finds that her royal husband has little interest in her.  This leads to her becoming a spoiled, free-spending, fun-loving party girl who uses her status to get whatever she wants.The anachronistic soundtrack does not fit at all & I found it very distracting.  Hearing Rock songs juxtaposed with late 1700s France is not an auspicious combination ~ at least not to me.  On top of that, there are problems with the sound mixing as there were times that I couldn't hear the dialogue clearly because the music was too loud.The most egregious part of the movie is what it omits.  Yes, Bastille day goes on in the background of the movie and there are references to it (kind of like in a Shakespearian play) but it is not treated with a whole lot of depth.  The end of the movie shows the French king & queen riding in a chariot away from their palace and an angry mob.  Not to sound crude, but the arrest, imprisonment, (sham) trial and execution of Marie Antoinette are among the most interesting aspects of her life.

I knew before seeing the film that it was going to be a fluff piece judging by all the negative reviews I had read. So it didn't come as a shock to me to see how bad this film is. It is a shame that this film is a major disappointment. I love Sophia Coppola's other films. Marie Antoinette is a turkey compared to Virgin Suicides and Lost in Translation.""Marie Antoinette"" is based on the Antonia Fraser biography ""Marie Antoinette: the Journey"". Unfortunately this film only focuses on Marie Antoinette's life as a queen. The film makes no mention of her childhood or what follows after the queen and king are evacuated from their home during the French Revolution. Do not expect a character study in this fluff piece of a biopic. The film does not present Marie Antoinette as a complicated individual as Antonia Fraser's novel does. Sophia Coppola presents her as Paris Hilton of her era.My biggest issues with this turkey is: a) the lack of foreign accents, and b) the inclusion of modern music. Since when did Marie Antoinette speak with an American accent? Was Sophia Coppola too darn lazy to make her cast to learn to speak a different accent other than their own?!Kirsten Dunst's lack of an Austrian accent did not make for a convincing performance. I also did not like Kirsten as Marie Antoinette altogether. Reese Witherspoon or Scarlett Johanssen would have a been a better choice. Secondly, I love the '80s. I love The Cure. I love Siouxsie & The Banshees. This type of music did not belong in a period film. This collection of '80s music made the film feel like one extended music video. The writing was weak. The film was truly lacking in a direction. I don't even think there was much of a plot to the story.

648329,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00005JPAS,Ed Uyeshima,"[3, 5]","Director Sofia Coppola certainly takes an audacious look at the life of the legendary 18th century Queen of France who supposedly ""let them eat cake"" in this elaborately costumed 2006 film. At the same time, Coppola keeps the dramatic focus relatively small versus the expansive political backdrop of the story. The approach works to a point since the filmmaker has an obviously reflective handle on how a young girl can feel when thrown unexpectedly into the spotlight and then made mincemeat by her critics (think of her aborted acting career when 1990's ""The Godfather III"" was released).The downside is that the dramatic arc of the French monarch's life feels somewhat misshapen by this unique perspective since the film's first three-quarters meticulously follows Marie's youthful ascent to the throne and her wearying efforts to consummate her arranged marriage to Louis XVI. There are throwaway scenes of shopping sprees with her ladies-in-waiting and an underdeveloped illicit romance with Count Fersen, all of which would not look out of place in an episode of ""Sex and the City"". Once she conceives and delivers her first child, the movie starts to feel cursory about subsequent events with little of the historic context needed to make the climax resonate.For all the film's dramatic flaws, I have to say Kirsten Dunst is ideally cast in the title role. Starting her role as a 14-year old Austrian princess taken from her family, she captures not only the giggly vacuity but the sense of self-possession and decorum that makes her viable as a queen. A curiously cast Jason Schwartzman gained weight for the role of her bulbous, emotionally indifferent husband, Louis. He says relatively little but his natural awkwardness in period costume succeeds in making the king an ultimately sympathetic figure. Others come in and out of the story though with little resonance, even with proven scenery chewers like Judy Davis as the instructional Contesse de Noailles, Steve Coogan as the advice-giving Ambassador Mercy, Rip Torn as the libidinous Louis XV, and Asia Argento as his blatantly whorish mistress, Madame du Barry.What does work well are most of the visual elements - the use of real Versailles locales augmented by K.K. Barrett's luxuriant production design, Lance Acord's candy-colored cinematography, and Milena Canonero's resplendent costumes. The anachronistic use of 1980's-era new wave music, blended with the Baroque music true to the period and Jean-Benot Dunckel and Nicolas Godin's original score, turns out to be a daring choice that works well toward Coppola's revisionist view of the queen. Yet for all the creativity on display, one is left to linger on the movie's unfulfilled possibilities of how the economic downturn and class disparities in 18th century France could be seen as a mirror for today. But that aspect obviously doesn't interest Coppola, who shows as she did in ""Lost in Translation"", a deep affinity for women caught out of place and the ways they handle their loneliness.",3,Another Misunderstood Monarch and a Dazzling Visual Recreation of 18th Century France,1162080000,"10 29, 2006",2006,3019,"['Director', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'certainly', 'audacious', 'look', 'life', 'legendary', '18th', 'century', 'Queen', 'France', 'who', 'supposedly', 'let', 'eat', 'cake', 'elaborately', 'costumed', '2006', 'film', 'same', 'time', 'Coppola', 'dramatic', 'focus', 'relatively', 'small', 'expansive', 'political', 'backdrop', 'story', 'approach', 'point', 'filmmaker', 'obviously', 'reflective', 'handle', 'how', 'young', 'girl', 'can', 'feel', 'when', 'thrown', 'unexpectedly', 'spotlight', 'then', 'made', 'mincemeat', 'critics', 'think', 'aborted', 'acting', 'career', 'when', '1990', 'Godfather', 'III', 'was', 'released', '.The', 'downside', 'dramatic', 'arc', 'French', 'monarch', 'life', 'feels', 'somewhat', 'misshapen', 'unique', 'perspective', 'film', 'first', 'three-quarters', 'meticulously', 'Marie', 'youthful', 'ascent', 'throne', 'wearying', 'efforts', 'consummate', 'arranged', 'marriage', 'Louis', 'XVI', 'are', 'throwaway', 'scenes', 'shopping', 'sprees', 'ladies-in-waiting', 'underdeveloped', 'illicit', 'romance', 'Count', 'Fersen', 'would', 'not', 'look', 'place', 'episode', 'Sex', 'City', 'first', 'child', 'movie', 'feel', 'cursory', 'subsequent', 'events', 'little', 'historic', 'context', 'needed', 'make', 'climax', 'resonate.For', 'film', 'dramatic', 'flaws', 'have', 'say', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'ideally', 'cast', 'title', 'role', 'Starting', 'role', '14-year', 'old', 'Austrian', 'princess', 'taken', 'family', 'not', 'only', 'giggly', 'vacuity', 'sense', 'self-possession', 'decorum', 'viable', 'queen', 'curiously', 'cast', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'gained', 'weight', 'role', 'bulbous', 'emotionally', 'indifferent', 'husband', 'Louis', 'relatively', 'little', 'natural', 'awkwardness', 'period', 'costume', 'making', 'king', 'ultimately', 'sympathetic', 'figure', 'Others', 'come', 'story', 'little', 'resonance', 'even', 'proven', 'scenery', 'chewers', 'Judy', 'Davis', 'instructional', 'Contesse', 'de', 'Noailles', 'Steve', 'Coogan', 'advice-giving', 'Ambassador', 'Mercy', 'Rip', 'Torn', 'libidinous', 'Louis', 'XV', 'Asia', 'Argento', 'blatantly', 'whorish', 'mistress', 'Madame', 'Barry.What', 'work', 'well', 'are', 'most', 'visual', 'elements', 'use', 'real', 'Versailles', 'locales', 'augmented', 'K.K', 'Barrett', 'luxuriant', 'production', 'design', 'Lance', 'Acord', 'candy-colored', 'cinematography', 'Milena', 'Canonero', 'resplendent', 'costumes', 'anachronistic', 'use', ""1980's-era"", 'new', 'wave', 'music', 'blended', 'Baroque', 'music', 'true', 'period', 'Jean-Benot', 'Dunckel', 'Nicolas', 'Godin', 'original', 'score', 'out', 'be', 'daring', 'choice', 'well', 'Coppola', 'revisionist', 'view', 'queen', 'creativity', 'display', 'one', 'left', 'linger', 'movie', 'unfulfilled', 'possibilities', 'how', 'economic', 'downturn', 'class', 'disparities', '18th', 'century', 'France', 'could', 'be', 'seen', 'mirror', 'today', 'aspect', 'obviously', ""n't"", 'interest', 'Coppola', 'who', 'did', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'deep', 'affinity', 'women', 'caught', 'place', 'ways', 'handle', 'loneliness']",Marie Antoinette

Just as the technicolour heroes do not allow us to forget for a second that they are normal people, type-cast public faces and investments, so under the thin tinsel of schematically produced fantasy emerges in unmistakable outline the skeleton of cinema-ontology, the whole obligatory hierarchy of values, th canon of the undesirable or the exemplary. There is nothing more practical than escape, nothing more fervently espoused to big business: we are abducted into the distance only to have the laws of empiricist living hammered from afar, unhampered by empirical possibilities of evasion, into our own consciousness. The escape is full of message. And message, the opposite, looks what it is: the wish to flee from flight. It reifies the resistance to reification.""- Theodore Adorno, MINIMA MORALIAThis movie is an American TURKEY and is less about France of the *ancien regime* and more a Girl Gone Wild in costume (except when naked at the Austro/French border.)The only ""beauty"" is the existing artistry of the Louvre and Versailles, and a tourist could have recorded that. To this, the directors add a pointless ""rock"" score that doesn't work. A rock and roll sound track could have worked, but this one is basically the eternal (ewige) male voice of rock and roll, advising La Antoinette to put out.The dialectic is conspicuous by its absence. I would have felt sorry for Marie A had I'd got to see her dragged through the streets in a tumbril to the place of execution as drawn on the spot by David, but the directors of this execrable film were the sort of Californians who are like, who's David, man, is he a friend of yourn?The movie, pure Thesis, asserts that art 'n beauty 'n poetry, all that chick stuff, was created by the leading figures of the *ancien regime* and boo most assuredly hoo that the ignorant mob destroyed it.News fa lash. What Elvis Costello would and has called All This Useless Beauty was created by the proletariat and the middle class of the 17th and the 18th century. We retain the natural right to destroy it when it turns against us. Aristos and CEOs make NOTHING.The most musical of Marie Antoinette's contemporaries sponsored Bach (a middle class workadaddy) and Frederick the Great's sole composition seems to have been the Hohenfriedberger March.Hey, that's great, Fred.Marie Antoinette is presented as sponsoring the extension of Versailles. Movies often do this. Subconsciously limning capitalist relations as the only possible relations, they make it appear that ""visionaries"" create palaces by speaking to flunkies.What's the reality? The reality is that when Versailles was under construction, Marie's husband's great-grandfather Louie (Louie) quatorze wanted the first great French artist, the sublime Poussin, to work for him.Louie Louie wanted Nick not so much to paint the visions Nick began to see in his mind's eye, visions of a cold passion, but Louie's stupid demi-victories in Louie's stupid wars. Some of those ""victories"" were actually defeats when the British under John, Duke of Marlborough, got into the act!Poussin fled to Rome in the 17th century to work exclusively for *haute* bourgeois and minor nobility, creating French art from nothing.Marie probably knew nothing of Poussin.To represent the French revolution as pure offstage destruction like the sea monster in Racine's Phedre is to entrap the audience in an American ideology of hegemony, which in Bush's foreign policy has stunningly lowered my country's moral authority by admitting no outside to the American ""dream"", a ""dream"" that most Americans themselves can no longer afford!Don't waste your money! Watch La Nuit de Varennes, watch Wazjda's incomparable Danton, watch the classic silent film Napoleon by Abel Gance if that cute history teacher wants you to learn a thing or two about the French revolution before you get knocked up in back of the Steak and Shake, girlfriend.La Nuit de Varennes stars the incomparable Hannah Schygulla as an Antoinette clone of the minor nobility who Sphinxlike knows the jig is up, and Harvey Keitel as Tom Paine.In LNDV, Marie Antoinette is a shoe which stamps petulantly in the floor of an inn on The Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen. You must know, darling, American Woman, that this is the opinion of the sort of people who make this film of the sort of people like you and me babe who buy DVDs.About the only good part in this movie is a true star turn by Louis XV's mistress, the scandalous and hot Madame du Barry. When sent to the knackers, she glares backward at the palace with a look that scorns not only the Rococo but also this postmodern American rococo piece of utter nonsense.But all she is is someone's psycho Mom from the 1960s.Just then Tom Paine, himself,Came running from across the field,Shouting at this lovely girlAnd commanding her to yield.And as she was letting go her grip,Up Tom Paine did

And OK, the sets were stunning, and the very likeable Kirsten Dunst did bring the character of Marie Antoinette to life.  But there's a little detail called dialogue, which in this case was either absent or incredibly dull, with most of the scenes relying on visuals and music to compensate for the lack of substance.  And, while the film is fairly strong on little personal details, such as Marie Antoinette being forced to leave her dog at the border (although it was not a pug) and enduring the humiliation of giving birth to her first daughter in public, the larger historical context is often ignored or oversimplified to the point of inaccuracy.  It is ironic that the film falls victim to the same hyper-materialism and superficiality of which Marie Antoinette herself was accused.

648334,A31T5ANGT3NCDR,B00005JPAS,elena maria vidal,"[3, 5]","I saw Sofia Coppola's ""Marie-Antoinette"" last night, accompanied by a friend and some good wine and cheese. It was the only way to make it through a film which was nearly unwatchable for me. My friend, who lived in France for ten years, shared my opinion that it had no plot and no screenplay. I was ready to be annoyed by the historical inaccuracies (which were legion) but on the whole was expecting an edgy, irreverent, slightly burlesque version of Marie-Antoinette's life. However, the film only generated laughter at the depths of banality into which it hastily plunged.Let me interrupt myself to say to those who did enjoy the movie that I understand why you liked it. In spite of the sometimes bizarre cinematography, Versailles, the gardens, the Petit Trianon were captured in all their splendor. The star of the film was really the Sun King, Louis XIV, the one responsible for such grandeur. The birds singing in the background were a lovely touch as well. Also, the growing tenderness between Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette, although it could have been developed more, was sweetly endearing. The last scene, when they are being carted off to their doom and Louis (Jason Schwartzman) looks at Antoinette (Kirsten Dunst) and she bravely smiles at him in return, was worth the price of the DVD.I think that what made the film compelling for many was the snippets taken from actual letters and conversations, for the real life of Marie-Antoinette is the stuff of legend; there is magic in her very name. The places where she lived are imbued with a mystery of sorrow and enchantment.Anyone who does a historical piece, be it a novel or film, knows that what makes it authentic is the consistent attention to details. It is the little historical fine points that bring the past to life. Otherwise, why bother with history? Why go to so much work over period costumes and then have people do and say things that are totally out of character for the era? Sometimes people would bow and curtsy as the princess walked by, and other times they would not. The impression I got was of sloppy direction and sheer indifference to the atmosphere of eighteenth century France.The scenes of the Fersen affair were a bizarre intrusion into what little story line existed. It did not make sense to show Antoinette having sex with Fersen when she was finally happy with her husband and baby. The affair had no passion, no sensuality, no romance.Why was Antoinette always shown lolling around? The queen was a busy lady. Even in her leisure she would be occupied with needlework. She embroidered much of the upholstery in her rooms. It almost made me fall asleep to see her prone on the grass all the time.It is a shame. There were many accomplished actors involved in the production, if only they had been given a screenplay. If only they had had some direction, and a diction coach to mainstream the accents. The varying accents, as well as the rock music, were among the most jarring and distracting elements of the film. The music alone was enough to make me want to turn it off, as well as the constant gorging on sweets. I have never seen such an obscene display of pastries. I will not eat a French pastry again for a long time.",2,Persevering through the pastries,1173571200,"03 11, 2007",2007,3225,"['saw', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'Marie-Antoinette', 'last', 'night', 'accompanied', 'friend', 'good', 'wine', 'cheese', 'was', 'only', 'way', 'make', 'film', 'was', 'nearly', 'unwatchable', 'friend', 'who', 'lived', 'France', 'ten', 'years', 'shared', 'opinion', 'had', 'plot', 'screenplay', 'was', 'ready', 'be', 'annoyed', 'historical', 'inaccuracies', 'were', 'legion', 'whole', 'was', 'expecting', 'edgy', 'irreverent', 'slightly', 'burlesque', 'version', 'Marie-Antoinette', 'life', 'However', 'film', 'only', 'generated', 'laughter', 'depths', 'banality', 'hastily', 'plunged.Let', 'interrupt', 'say', 'who', 'did', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'understand', 'why', 'liked', 'spite', 'sometimes', 'bizarre', 'cinematography', 'Versailles', 'gardens', 'Petit', 'Trianon', 'were', 'captured', 'splendor', 'star', 'film', 'was', 'really', 'Sun', 'King', 'Louis', 'XIV', 'one', 'responsible', 'such', 'grandeur', 'birds', 'singing', 'background', 'were', 'lovely', 'touch', 'well', 'Also', 'growing', 'tenderness', 'Louis', 'XVI', 'Marie-Antoinette', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'developed', 'more', 'was', 'sweetly', 'endearing', 'last', 'scene', 'when', 'are', 'being', 'carted', 'doom', 'Louis', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'Antoinette', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'bravely', 'return', 'was', 'price', 'DVD.I', 'think', 'what', 'made', 'film', 'compelling', 'many', 'was', 'snippets', 'taken', 'actual', 'letters', 'conversations', 'real', 'life', 'Marie-Antoinette', 'stuff', 'legend', 'magic', 'very', 'name', 'places', 'where', 'lived', 'are', 'imbued', 'mystery', 'sorrow', 'enchantment.Anyone', 'who', 'historical', 'piece', 'be', 'novel', 'film', 'what', 'authentic', 'consistent', 'attention', 'details', 'little', 'historical', 'fine', 'points', 'bring', 'past', 'life', 'Otherwise', 'why', 'bother', 'history', 'Why', 'go', 'so', 'much', 'work', 'period', 'costumes', 'then', 'have', 'people', 'do', 'say', 'things', 'are', 'totally', 'character', 'era', 'Sometimes', 'people', 'would', 'bow', 'curtsy', 'princess', 'walked', 'other', 'times', 'would', 'not', 'impression', 'got', 'was', 'sloppy', 'direction', 'sheer', 'indifference', 'atmosphere', 'eighteenth', 'century', 'France.The', 'scenes', 'Fersen', 'affair', 'were', 'bizarre', 'intrusion', 'what', 'little', 'story', 'line', 'existed', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'sense', 'show', 'Antoinette', 'having', 'sex', 'Fersen', 'when', 'was', 'finally', 'happy', 'husband', 'baby', 'affair', 'had', 'passion', 'sensuality', 'romance.Why', 'was', 'Antoinette', 'always', 'shown', 'lolling', 'around', 'queen', 'was', 'busy', 'lady', 'Even', 'leisure', 'would', 'be', 'occupied', 'needlework', 'embroidered', 'much', 'upholstery', 'rooms', 'almost', 'made', 'fall', 'asleep', 'see', 'prone', 'grass', 'time.It', 'shame', 'were', 'many', 'accomplished', 'actors', 'involved', 'production', 'only', 'had', 'been', 'given', 'screenplay', 'only', 'had', 'had', 'direction', 'diction', 'coach', 'mainstream', 'accents', 'varying', 'accents', 'as', 'well', 'rock', 'music', 'were', 'most', 'jarring', 'distracting', 'elements', 'film', 'music', 'alone', 'was', 'enough', 'make', 'want', 'turn', 'off', 'as', 'well', 'constant', 'gorging', 'sweets', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'obscene', 'display', 'pastries', 'will', 'not', 'eat', 'French', 'pastry', 'again', 'long', 'time']",Marie Antoinette

My point is the movie is about Antoinette and in 18th century only in order to plaigarise the luxury of the times and little else.The only Queen here is a movie director's daughter being crowned with a career and it shows.Bravo the set and costume designers though-the film is stunning for that.The script is kept simple and there is no character developments.It's too simple. As in avoiding the question of the King's impotence which has been suggested was caused by no more than an over-tight fore-skin which would have enlivened up an otherwise dull role.But is the aim for the couple to come off as just blameless good people and not get too embarassing or personal? Similarily, Antoinette is robbed of her famous'let them eat cake'line and there is no enquiry into, if she'd been allowed to have said it,if this was only true naivete from being too pure or being spoit or gullible or being ignorant of life out-side the court. Apparently she is too sensible kind a person to even be confused with such a faux-pas in the film. It's an oversimplification- some film space could have used to add interest instead of lingering on shoes or food.Both in chararcter development and interest Antoinette was deprived of her of pathos plus i felt cheated out of the guillotine scene which almost rhymes with cake in connection with Marie Antoinette.Would a beheading with mobs have been too taxing for Sophia Coppola's director's skills?

I, personally, found it lovely and telling, poignant and memorable.  The movie successfully conveyed the emotional struggle of Marie Antoinette to survive in Versailles.  Of all things, I most acutely felt Marie's frustration towards her frustrations--the frustration of not being allowed to feel (or at least show) frustration.All the beautiful colors, lush visuals, and pop music created the right scenery for showing the lavishness of the French court.  More importantly, it portrayed the way Marie Antoinette coped--she escaped through diversions.  It's simply a shame that the movie got more press for its musical choices than the movie itself.  (For the record, I think Coppola's choices for the music soundtrack were pitch-perfect for what she was trying to achieve, which was a sense of cutting-edge hipness and coolness.  The feeling simply wouldn't be the same if the music was 'style galant.')Perhaps the movie was too young to appeal to people who couldn't get over some stylistic choices.  It may simply be that, unfortunately, some critics can't see that ""youthful"" is not the equivalence of ""immaturity.""  I noticed this when, in 2003, the popular artist Jewel released an album that was hip and glossy on the surface, but still poignant and thoughtful on a deeper level--audiences couldn't get over the fact that the form and presentation was not ""acoustic folk chick with a guitar,"" which they equated with seriousness.  Therefore, judgements were made on the form and not the deeper message.  I feel that this is what bit Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette.  The surface form was fresh, youthful, hip, and cool--and that was as far as some people could see.  I usually do not criticize other reviewers, but I must say that I agree with the previous review titled: ""Think it's shallow? Look closer. Your interpretation is what's shallow.""Coppola's Marie Antoinette is poetry.  Her art is subtle, but still striking, nonetheless, and this was one of the most enjoyable movies I've seen recently.  I'm kicking myself for believing the critics' reviews of the movie (many of which accused it of being fluff--something I still can't grasp) and not seeing it on the big screen.  I thought it was fresh.

648346,A2BPDFR58H9575,B00005JPAS,Galina,"[2, 5]","Sophia Coppola's ""Marie Antoinette"" (2006) is an embarrassing disaster - glamorous, colorful, shot inside and outside of French Versailles in its most lavish but disaster nevertheless. I don't know for whom the movie was made - perhaps, for Ms. Coppolla herself to add another chapter to her dreamy quiet slow moving films about bored and confused young girls. Her previous work, ""Lost in Translation"" was quite good even if not a timeless masterpiece as some critics and viewers tend to believe. Her latest film about a girl who happened to be born in 1755, a daughter and sister to the Austrian Emperors, the future wife and mother to French Kings, simply does not work. The film starts when Marie is 15 and she leaves her beloved Vienna to marry the future Luis XVI. She arrives to the most fashionable, glamorous, and corrupted European court where she would remain ""the foreigner"", ""The Austrian"". The film depicts Marie Antoinette's life up until 1789 when the Great French Revolution starts with the storming of Bastille, the infamous Paris prison on July 14, 1789, and the King and Queen leave Versailles forever to meet their destiny. The film completely omits the final chapter of Marie Antoinette's life and never mentions the circumstances of her last five years. These five years were filled with the purest tragedy: death of her husband who was tried for treason, found guilty and executed on the guillotine, separation from her son who was taken from her and died in captivity when he was 12 years old. She herself was brought to trial where she was accused among the other things in sexual abuse of her son. To this horrible accusation, the former queen, ""the Widow Capet"" or simply ""Antoinette Capet"" replied with the genuine royal dignity, ""If I have not replied it is because Nature itself refuses to respond to such a charge laid against a mother...""When I visited Paris several years ago, I went to see The Conciergerie Prison where Marie Antoinette was kept before her death and from where she was taken on the morning of October 16, 1793, ""forced into a tumbrel and paraded through the streets of Paris for over an hour before reaching the Place de la R&eacute;volution where the guillotine stood."" Spending short time in the Antoinette's prison cell let me learn about her tragic final days that Sofia Coppola chose not to include in her movie. I respect her decision to tell the story of the ill-fated last Queen of France as a bored and frustrated teenage girl with a sweet smile and charming dimples, whose equally young, shy and totally inexperienced husband was more interested in the history of locks and keys than in making love and children to her but by making Marie-Antoinette the central figure of the film and never taking her camera outside the palace, Coppolla limited her movie to the typical ""chick flick"" that happened to take place in Versailles.Marie-Antoinette as played by Kurstin Dunst is not very interesting person; she leads a boring life within the strict etiquette's rules of the Royal Palace, and all she wants - to have some fun. It is OK to make a movie about boring life of boring and bored insignificant people but it is not OK to never mention what actually was going on outside the palace where the real life was happening and the revolution was brewing way before Coppola chose to mention the shortage of bread for the commoners and storming of Bastille. The second half of the 18th Century was enormously interesting and eventful time in the history of France, Europe, and the World. It was the time when Mozart wrote his music, Pierre-Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais had finished his three Figaro plays, and the most brilliant one, ""The Marriage of Figaro"" was banned by the King for its irreverent attitude towards the aristocracy from being performed. Outside the Palace's walls, very intelligent, free thinking angry young men from ""Third Estate"" (the ""Commons""), grew up, received good education, and became lawyers, physicians, journalists, and scientists. Influenced by philosophical and political ideas of Jean-Jacques Rousseau and the principles of Libert&eacute;, Egalit&eacute;, Fraternit&eacute; that they embraced in The Jacobin Club in Paris, they later would become leaders of the French Revolution that would destroy the old regime of the absolute monarchy but eventually turn into the Reign of Terror in which the passionate revolutionaries would perish along with the aristocrats. Among them, Mirabeau - a great orator and able statesman; Danton, a figure larger than life; Robespierre, known as ""incorruptible"", Jean Paul Marat, scientist and revolutionary. None of them have been ever mentioned in the movie. Even the notorious Affair of the diamond necklace that was historically significant as one of the events that led to the French populace's bitter disappointment with the monarchy and contributed to the growing hatred toward the Queen who had been nicknamed, ""Madam Deficit"", did not deserve a single remark in the movie about Marie Antoinette.I've read some articles that defend the film by saying that it is not a historic movie but ""the story of the silly teenager who embodied a corrupt, absolutist state in its terminal decadence"". These articles keep pointing to the visual beauty, production design, Oscar winning costumes, and nice cinematography. They are indeed lovely and the movie is an eye candy but Marie Antoinette as she was presented in the Sophia Coppola's movie can't herself hold this viewer's interest no matter how many pretty dresses with the elegant matching shoes she has changed and how many tiny delightful pastries she has eaten, and I am a huge fan of low cut dresses and those delicious pastries, believe me.2-/5 or

648347,AY12DBB0U420B,B00005JPAS,Gary Peterson,"[0, 0]","Last night's movie was ""Marie Antoinette."" I found it on our DVD shelves  and it must have been purchased by my wife at least a few years ago. The movie was interesting, to be sure, but presented a very incongruent mixture. For one, you should expect to just be overcome by the visuals. Magnificent! Stupendous! Totally unreal! Visually, this is one of the best movies I can ever remember watching. It doesn't matter whether it's the French countryside, the French palace and palace grounds, or the elaborately costumed cast, everything about this film is visually overwhelming and the photography is absolutely first rate. This is a movie I could enjoy by turning the sound off and just watching the visuals. It's that good.Then there's the music of the soundtrack. Well, in general it's rather good. There's some excellent classical music and there's a lot of what I might term ""French party music"" which is also quite good. Either fit the story of the movie quite well. Interspersed with this fine music are a handful of rock 'n' roll selections. Now, don't get me wrong here. Rock 'n' roll includes some of my favorite music and the selections which they chose were quite good. Evidently, someone had good taste. But, this is a 1770 French period piece and everything is done in that fashion, and done quite well. Why include 1980 American rock 'n' roll songs in the soundtrack, good though they might be? It just doesn't make sense. It doesn't help the movie, it disrupts it. Totally incongruent!Then there's the acting. It's stiff and formal. I just never could get into it. None of the people seemed at all real, except, perhaps, Kirsten Dunst in her role as Marie and that was marginal. Her husband was a stiff and wooden figure that I could never develop any empathy for, and that goes for the overwhelming rest of the cast. What goes here? How can they have such a wonderfully costumed cast and then acting that practically no one could relate to? Then there's another problem. Marie was evidently a widely-despised queen. Well, it didn't show at all. She was by far the most likable person in the cast. Then, and it was fortunately not shown in the movie, she was beheaded shortly after the time of the movie. It just doesn't fit her role in the movie. If she's so despicable, why set her up as the most likable person in the movie? It doesn't make sense.In any case, I have a lot of mixed feelings about this movie, both good and bad. It's just a splendid spectacle but could have used a lot of work in the writing and directing, in my opinion. I'd rate the visuals as five stars, no question. But the story, acting and sound track might rate no better than a three. Okay, I'll list it as four stars, but I'd consider it to be a badly flawed movie.Gary Peterson",4,"Visually Stupendous!

Ok I thought, not a bad start. So I sat down knowing only this about it.First the positive. It looks great and the sets are fantastic. Big whoop. Ok this is fine and great, if they were part of a story that went somewhere. But it doesnt.Over an hour in, we were still waiting for something to happen. The whole film seems to initially hinge on her producing an heir to the throne. Gradually over what seems three days of watching you suddenly understand that IS the film. I lost count of how many lifeless parties followed by failed consumations we saw cycled. Yes we got it first time, no need to show it repetitively for the 100th.There is very little dialogue, certainly at the start. We found ourselves looking at each other asking whether anything was going to happen. My wife tried the volume control a couple of times.The interesting bit, ie the revolution is dealt with in about the last 3 minutes. And you see nothing, presumably all the cash went on the sets and nothing was left over for a scriptwriter or extras.Very very dull. You have been warned.

648352,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00005JPAS,Grady Harp,"[3, 5]","Sofia Coppola offers another look at history's infamous Marie Antoinette, the premise being that she was in life just a simple young Austrian girl delivered to France as a political queen candidate, who liked pretty things, loved children, flowers, clothes, shopping, and sweets, and lived a life oblivious to the political turmoil outside the confines of Versailles until it was too late.  Coppola delivers her side of history with a maximum budget, endless sumptuous costumes, shoes, wigs, oft-changed costumed huge cast, top of the line creative cuisine and pastries, a nice little performance by Kirsten Dunst, an extended tour inside Versailles and two hours of minimal dialogue about rather inconsequential matters.Coppola does mix contemporary music with period music, an anachronism that is not additive but does allow us to see snippets of Rameau's 'Platee' (and a cut version of Susan Graham as Gluck's 'Orfeo' singing 'Che faro Euridice' in French translation on a beautiful stage with a sensuous nude model lying at her feet).  And if Coppola's purpose is to demonstrate how the 'media', whether that be printed or verbal history, has painted an incorrect picture of a charming young child/lady who happened to be blissfully unaware of the changes of the day, she has succeeded.  It just doesn't seem to be enough story for a two hour slick magazine spread on indulgences in France of the late 18th century.The cast is well chosen: Judy Davis exudes court etiquette as Comtesse de Noailles,  Rip Torn is a fine Louis XV more interested in his consort du Barry as well imitated by Asia Argento, Steve Coogan is Steve Coogan as Ambassador Mercy, Rose Byrne keeps the story afloat as Duchesse de Polignac, and Jason Schwartzman makes us understand why the distracted Louis XVI capitalized the troubles of a clueless court during the time of Revolution.The endless costume changes are entertaining to the eye but about as repetitive as the too frequent boudoir lack of activity between Marie and Louis.  This is one of those films where the Featurette on the DVD makes the evening worth tolerating; it is fresh, funny, informative, allows bonuses, and ultimately explains why the movie was made in the first place. As for the film itself, it is a long static song.

648353,AAIL33CYCT47J,B00005JPAS,Gregory Baird,"[8, 8]","Sofia Coppola has emerged as one of the most talented directors working today, and from a techincal standpoint 'Marie Antoinette' is a dazzling display of her boundless abilities.  Every sumptuous detail of the production is gorgeous: the lighting, the cinematography, the music (which controversially features modern songs to bridge the gap between the past and present), and especially the elaborate costumes and art direction.  I have had the pleasure of visiting Versailles, and Coppola captures every breathtakingly beautiful corner of its (in)famous being -- an especially glorious achievement in that she restores all of its glory to it so that it becomes a vibrant location instead of the ominous museum that it is today.  A lot of hostility has been directed at the soundtrack, but I don't see what the fuss is about.  The songs fit the story perfectly and not the exquisitely painful vice versa that has bogged down Cameron Crowe's recent films, for example.Where 'Marie Antoinette' loses its focus is in Coppola's screenplay, adapted from Antonia Fraser's alternate take on Antoinette's role in history.  I love what it's going for in that it depicts Louis and, particularly, Marie as youths caught up in the frivolity of their adolescence and totally unprepared to rule a nation in turmoil, but Coppola's script only hints at those themes and doesn't really get them across.  A large part of the film (more than an hour of its two hour running time) is devoted to Marie's precarious situation in her new home when she is unable to consummate her marriage to the curiously disinterested Louis and produce an heir to the throne that would secure her position of prominence in the court.  There is dramatic heft here, no thanks to Kirsten Dunst -- who makes Marie an implacable party girl, with few to no hints at any inner angst in her coiffed head -- but it does little to get those aforementioned themes across.  Louis' disastrous reign over France is instead relegated to the film's final forty-five minutes, making it feel rushed and woefully unexplored.  There is no build-up to the revolution that would claim the lives of Marie and Louis, so that if you had no knowledge of French history from high school you would be hard pressed to understand what the fuss was about.  This is largely due to the determinedly insular world that the film depicts; we rarely get a glimpse of anything going on outside of Versailles, and when we do it is only for the principles to party hard in Paris and steal home in the middle of the night (an otherwise clever allusion on Coppola's part to the club-hopping of today's royalty).  It makes sense if you consider that Marie and Louis were actively trapped in their environment -- literally put on display like the prized animals in a zoo -- but it makes the incredibly dire situation that the majority of France faced at that time frustratingly vague.  Coppola is an amazingly talented director and screenwriter (as evidenced by her previous films, 'The Virgin Suicides' and 'Lost in Translation'), but 'Marie Antoinette' only pays tribute to half of those gifts.  It's a marvel of direction and lush staging, but the screenplay is an oddly impenetrable facade that fails to get at the heart of one of history's most electrifying (and controversial) figures.The DVD's special features are relatively skimpy, but there's a fun (albeit brief) Cribs-style look at Versaille hosted by the affable Jason Schwartzman -- who displays such a great deal of charisma that it makes you respect his restrained portrayal of the dull Louis all the more.",3,Style over substance -- but what dazzling style it is!,1171670400,"02 17, 2007",2007,3591,"['Sofia', 'Coppola', 'emerged', 'one', 'most', 'talented', 'directors', 'working', 'today', 'techincal', 'standpoint', 'Antoinette', 'dazzling', 'display', 'boundless', 'abilities', 'sumptuous', 'detail', 'production', 'gorgeous', 'lighting', 'cinematography', 'music', 'controversially', 'modern', 'songs', 'bridge', 'gap', 'past', 'present', 'especially', 'elaborate', 'costumes', 'art', 'direction', 'have', 'had', 'pleasure', 'visiting', 'Versailles', 'Coppola', 'breathtakingly', 'beautiful', 'corner', 'famous', 'being', 'especially', 'glorious', 'achievement', 'glory', 'so', 'vibrant', 'location', 'instead', 'ominous', 'museum', 'today', 'lot', 'hostility', 'been', 'directed', 'soundtrack', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'what', 'fuss', 'about', 'songs', 'fit', 'story', 'perfectly', 'not', 'exquisitely', 'painful', 'vice', 'versa', 'bogged', 'down', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'recent', 'films', 'example.Where', ""'Marie"", 'Antoinette', 'focus', 'Coppola', 'screenplay', 'adapted', 'Antonia', 'Fraser', 'alternate', 'take', 'Antoinette', 'role', 'history', 'love', 'what', 'going', 'Louis', 'particularly', 'Marie', 'youths', 'caught', 'up', 'frivolity', 'adolescence', 'totally', 'unprepared', 'rule', 'nation', 'turmoil', 'Coppola', 'script', 'only', 'hints', 'themes', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'across', 'large', 'part', 'film', 'more', 'hour', 'two', 'hour', 'running', 'time', 'devoted', 'Marie', 'precarious', 'situation', 'new', 'home', 'when', 'unable', 'consummate', 'marriage', 'curiously', 'disinterested', 'Louis', 'produce', 'heir', 'throne', 'would', 'secure', 'position', 'prominence', 'court', 'dramatic', 'heft', 'here', 'thanks', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'who', 'Marie', 'implacable', 'party', 'girl', 'few', 'hints', 'inner', 'angst', 'coiffed', 'head', 'little', 'get', 'aforementioned', 'themes', 'Louis', 'disastrous', 'reign', 'France', 'instead', 'relegated', 'film', 'final', 'forty-five', 'minutes', 'making', 'feel', 'rushed', 'woefully', 'unexplored', 'build-up', 'revolution', 'would', 'claim', 'lives', 'Marie', 'Louis', 'had', 'knowledge', 'French', 'history', 'high', 'school', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'pressed', 'understand', 'what', 'fuss', 'was', 'about', 'largely', 'due', 'determinedly', 'insular', 'world', 'film', 'depicts', 'rarely', 'get', 'glimpse', 'anything', 'going', 'Versailles', 'when', 'do', 'only', 'principles', 'party', 'hard', 'Paris', 'steal', 'home', 'middle', 'night', 'otherwise', 'clever', 'allusion', 'Coppola', 'part', 'club-hopping', 'today', 'royalty', 'sense', 'consider', 'Marie', 'Louis', 'were', 'actively', 'trapped', 'environment', 'literally', 'put', 'display', 'prized', 'animals', 'zoo', 'incredibly', 'dire', 'situation', 'majority', 'France', 'faced', 'time', 'frustratingly', 'vague', 'Coppola', 'amazingly', 'talented', 'director', 'screenwriter', 'evidenced', 'previous', 'films', 'Virgin', 'Suicides', ""'Lost"", 'Translation', ""'Marie"", 'Antoinette', 'only', 'pays', 'tribute', 'half', 'gifts', 'marvel', 'direction', 'lush', 'staging', 'screenplay', 'oddly', 'impenetrable', 'facade', 'get', 'heart', 'one', 'history', 'most', 'electrifying', 'controversial', 'figures.The', 'DVD', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'relatively', 'skimpy', 'fun', 'brief', 'Cribs-style', 'look', 'Versaille', 'hosted', 'affable', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'who', 'great', 'deal', 'charisma', 'respect', 'restrained', 'portrayal', 'dull', 'Louis', 'more']",Marie Antoinette

I had read about her saying ""Let them eat cake"" for years, when she asked why the peasants were rioting during the French Revolution and was told that they had no bread to eat.  What I didn't really realized until watching this movie was how sheltered and out of touch she was.  She was only 14 when she was packed off to marry Louis, who she had never seen before, was stripped and inspected for blemishes when she reached the hand off point( how embarrassing) and had something like forty people sitting around her bed watching on her wedding night.

I didn't mind that so much. It's interesting. However off kelter this depiction is, it's none the less fascinating, and original. The set,and costume design is fantastic. Kierstin Dunst does a fabulous job. The movie is odd, and the frustrating thing is that a lot of the script is mumbled, and makes it hard to understand.What you do understand is a very weak script, without much to it. The drama and climaxes are swept over, and there seem to lack any character development. Weirdly, the preview tells you more about the chronology than the movie itself.

648362,A1KLG8F5APLM2N,B00005JPAS,h,"[5, 7]","Sofia Coppola is the real star of this movie.  Like her short film, ""Lick the Star"" she uses her direction to create an atmosphere of female naughtiness in the most couture sense.  Her female characters are so ""haute"", they are above our understanding, so ""cool"", they can only look down on us from their pedestals of ""I-want-you-to-want-me land""  Like Chloe, or Lux, Marie Antoinette is one of these vixens let loose and set free to rock music and left to her teenage tantalizing.Marie Antoinette is like Chanel No 5 perfume-timeless, misunderstood-but beautiful and not meant for the timid.""Marie Antoinette"" is based on the Antonia Fraser biography...an excellent choice-more daring and novel-like.Filmed from the point-of-view of a fifteen year old girl, who at first, is taunted like the new girl at school trying to pick out her seat in a gossipy filled high-school cafeteria.  Marie's entire existence is within the walls of Versailles that confine her.  At first, she resists the barriers of her new station-even having to give up her beloved pets and friends, then like any adventurous teenager, she rebels -she parties, drinks, gambles.  What else is a girl of 15 to do when she is given the keys to a kingdom of luxuries and decadence?It's akin to watching Gustav, the fat kid in Willy Wonka, enter the candy-filled room the first time.  I would be eating cake night and day too, and indeed Marie Antoinette does just that-she gorges herself in her own wealth until it begins to eat away at her sheltered existence.  After becoming a young Queen, a young mother, she eventually becomes a young target at the center of a world-wide revolution. The ""Queen of debt"" , as she was known, realizes life at Versailles is not life at all-only a edifice, filled with every luxury to entertain her and keep her blind from the realities of French life, poverty, truth and eventually war.Bravo to Sofia Coppola for creating yet another world of female excitement and tension, and sexuality.  I adore the mix of marzipan colors and MTV video-esque imagery, you really feel submerged in a teenager's world of gluttony and flirtation.This film simultaneously captures the history of the infamous Marie as Queen of France and her fragile downfall as a young teen, testing the borders of her power, control, and blooming sexuality.",5,Fresh Take on Cake,1163030400,"11 9, 2006",2006,2325,"['Sofia', 'Coppola', 'real', 'star', 'movie', 'short', 'film', 'Lick', 'Star', 'direction', 'create', 'atmosphere', 'female', 'naughtiness', 'most', 'couture', 'sense', 'female', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'haute', 'are', 'understanding', 'cool', 'can', 'only', 'look', 'down', 'pedestals', 'I-want-you-to-want-me', 'land', 'Chloe', 'Lux', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'one', 'vixens', 'let', 'loose', 'set', 'free', 'rock', 'music', 'left', 'teenage', 'tantalizing.Marie', 'Antoinette', 'Chanel', 'No', '5', 'perfume-timeless', 'misunderstood-but', 'beautiful', 'not', 'meant', 'timid', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'based', 'Antonia', 'Fraser', 'biography', 'excellent', 'choice-more', 'daring', 'novel-like.Filmed', 'point-of-view', 'fifteen', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'who', 'first', 'taunted', 'new', 'girl', 'school', 'trying', 'pick', 'out', 'seat', 'gossipy', 'filled', 'high-school', 'cafeteria', 'Marie', 'entire', 'existence', 'walls', 'Versailles', 'first', 'barriers', 'new', 'station-even', 'having', 'give', 'up', 'beloved', 'pets', 'friends', 'then', 'adventurous', 'teenager', '-she', 'parties', 'drinks', 'gambles', 'What', 'else', 'girl', '15', 'do', 'when', 'given', 'keys', 'kingdom', 'luxuries', 'decadence', 'akin', 'watching', 'Gustav', 'fat', 'kid', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'enter', 'candy-filled', 'room', 'first', 'time', 'would', 'be', 'eating', 'cake', 'night', 'day', 'too', 'indeed', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'just', 'that-she', 'gorges', 'own', 'wealth', 'eat', 'away', 'sheltered', 'existence', 'becoming', 'young', 'Queen', 'young', 'mother', 'eventually', 'young', 'target', 'center', 'world-wide', 'revolution', 'Queen', 'debt', 'was', 'known', 'life', 'Versailles', 'not', 'life', 'all-only', 'edifice', 'filled', 'luxury', 'entertain', 'keep', 'blind', 'realities', 'French', 'life', 'poverty', 'truth', 'eventually', 'war.Bravo', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'creating', 'yet', 'world', 'female', 'excitement', 'tension', 'sexuality', 'adore', 'mix', 'marzipan', 'colors', 'MTV', 'video-esque', 'imagery', 'really', 'feel', 'submerged', 'teenager', 'world', 'gluttony', 'flirtation.This', 'film', 'simultaneously', 'history', 'infamous', 'Marie', 'Queen', 'France', 'fragile', 'downfall', 'young', 'teen', 'testing', 'borders', 'power', 'control', 'blooming', 'sexuality']",Marie Antoinette

648368,A55RQ26WDPSM0,B00005JPAS,Iusedtobeacat,"[1, 1]","Presumably this movie is supposed to be taking place in 18th Century Pre/Revolutionary France centering around the life of one Maria Antonia better known as Marie Antoinette which is really the most known Key Figure in the French Revolution, not only because she was a shopaholic queen with no sense of governing the country but also because of the tragic ending she met (Having Her Head cut off by the evil Revolutionaries).You Have NO idea when you watch this film. Actually if one is to judge it based on the plot, dialogue and the characterizations this movie could be taking place in 21st Century Upstate NY or Palm Beach. There is so much chick flick and so little insight into History.Kristen Dunst looks the role and is a great actress but doesn't have the chance to shine. Sophia Coppola does very little to use the abilities of her actors in this film or explore the real *historical* figures this movie is based on. The script is very limited. Kristen Dunst walks in a fog infested state half of the movie. I would too if no one was interested in me. The rest of the characters are flat and one dimensional or two dimensional at best.There is So much then just meet the eye to Marie Antoinette than this movie is portraying, Yes she was sent to France and pushed into a political marriage of convenience with the Dauphine (to be) Louis XVI, Yes he was obsessed with eating, making locks and didn't care about her, Yes the marriage wasn't consummated till after seven years and it affected Marie Antoinette's life bitterly because she was failing at her duty to produce an heir, Yes she felt a silent hostility towards Louis XV's Mistress Du Barry, Yes she started an affair with a Young Swedish aristocrat, Yes she was a big spender, Yes she had little political abilities, Yes the French Hated her and she was sent eventually to her ultimate and tragic death.However, all that Spending, partying and extravagant attires didn't just come out of no where. There *were* reasons behind it and if one looks at them it actually makes rather perfect sense for her to be this woman she had become.This movie is accurate enough but the Psychological element is unfortunately lacking severely. We never get to meet the real Marie Antoinette or any of the other characters in her life. We never get to see what she was like before she went to the French Court, the viewer never gets insight into her childhood and thus never truly understands the culture shock she went through in France or understands how she struggled to cope in a foreign country with blunt customs so different and alien from her prudish roots. In the end the viewer has no sympathy for Marie Antoinette, her family or her aristocratic friends.Telling, Telling, Telling there is so much telling in this movie and almost no showing. We are told that a Revolution is stirring up and that the Royal Family is in danger but we are not shown how or why. The French Revolution is one of the most bloody, brutal and longest Revolutions ever to happen pass the Medieval ages. It is a Revolution that took place in the centre of Europe and lasted for an extraordinary ten years shaking the pyramid world around it.I am not asking for this movie to be a documentary however to barely touch on one of the goriest revolutions to ever happen in History in a movie happening in the heart of it all is rather disappointing. Plus, since this movie is an obvious Hollywood production and was intended for an America audience in the first place wouldn't it make sense if it involved the Revolution more for people who are unaware of it ? Instead the revolution is a backdrop at best and serves more as a plot device that doesn't even move the story forward.The ending is also a let down. It is anti-cliamitc since the viewer who knows his history is aware of the manner in which Marie Antoinette has died. Excluding the ultimate Execution scene IMO is the biggest fault this movie made and it only confirms my belief that it is a chick flick taking place in 1700s France.I understand that Sophia Coppola wanted to make a movie focusing on Marie Antoinette's personal life rather than the French revolution and it is accurate in doing so. Since it touched all Marie's personal affairs but what I find interesting is why the death of her first born son at the age of 7 isn't mentioned in this movie ?Well, on the other hand the customs are gorgeous, the sets are perfect. The actors all looks great and the scenery is fab. I usually bash on Historical movies for not being accurate not in this case. This time they got the history right, they just didn't get the characterization or the script right.For a better adoption of Marie Antoinette's life I recommend the Norma Shearer 1938 version. Yes, it is black and white but the acting, customs and the script is awesome. The viewer gets more insight into Marie's personality and her affairs and into the revolution. It is obviously a romanticized version of the story but its fun to watch.I would also recommend :The Scarlet Pimpernel",2,Chick Flick Masquerading as History !!!,1317168000,"09 28,

648369,A3I4IK25D7ATYY,B00005JPAS,JamesJames,"[13, 31]","Leave this silly music video alone, and RUN purchase the extraordinary, and just released, 1938 film with Norma Shearer as the French queen. If you want to know where Meryl Streep got her acting technique from, watch Shearer. Yes, there are moments, mostly when she's required to 'enter' a scene, when she's over-directed - but one must remember this was almost seventy years ago, and talkies were only a decade old. The majority of her screen time is a master class for film actors: her choices are stunningly complex yet exquistely simple and truthful. They will leave you, literally, momentarily breathless. It is difficult to grasp, by the end of the movie, that the actor playing the young Hapsburg princess is the same actor awaiting execution. One knows it's Norma Shearer, but she somehow has actually aged before our eyes, without the help of heavy makeup or props. The journey from Vienna to Versailles, to the Conciergerie to the Place de la Concorde is made by an actor whose ability to show her character's soul transforming, moment to terrible moment, defies comparison or explanation.  The sole performance which comes close to this is perhaps Vivien Leigh's in STREETCAR, but that would come nearly twenty years later and even it, like much of Streep's work, seems 'mannered' when referencing Shearer's Marie.The film is a wonder of imagery and restrained scoring - and the DVD transfer immaculate. The supporting cast, with the exception of a beautiful but rather wooden young Tyrone Power, is a dream. The discreet scale of the sets and the luminous costumes make the point that we are in another world, without overpowering us - the way the modern film does. This is also thanks to the extraordinary power of silver nitrate film stock, which has never been equaled since - in color or black and white.

That doesn't make it inherently bad, just a bit of a strain for older couples who like to enjoy watching a film together with interests for both parties.  What is so amazing about this movie is how a fortune must have been spent on costumes, scenery, and rights to film at Versailles and yet so little was really produced.  Moreover, the background music (hard rock) was totally inappropriate to the tone and flow of the movie.My wife and I kept waiting for some storylines to emerge that would justify the enormous expense and trouble the producers went to in making this film.  Compared to other historical dramas on Elizabeth I, the young queen Victoria, and the like, there was almost nothing of significance here.  All that results is a disbelief that the French royal couple would stay at their palace and wait to be captured and murdered by rebels.  If that's the way it was, fine.  But was it really that simple?  Were these people so removed from reality that they felt they didn't need protection from the starving mobs?  Wasn't there more intrigue with Robspierre, et al?  Where was Napolean Bonaparte and the French army when all this was going on?If you want to see a film where form triumphs over substance, this may be your ticket.

The consort to King Louis XVII of France lived a life undoubtedly pretty on the outside, at least until the fall of Versailles, so that the film is one of the most aesthetically pleasing affairs in recent history is hardly surprising.One may think it is a shame that Coppola chose to portray the window of time from Marie's entrance into France in May 1770 until the fall of Versailles in October 1789.  After all, most of the interesting events in her life took place after that, when she was stripped of her rights and eventually executed in 1793 (semi-spoiler: the film makes no mention of anything after 1789).  However, while Coppola's choice may make for a boring plot to those searching for a typical American drama, it also makes for an interesting and moving portrayal of a privileged but misunderstood young woman in another time and place.The film, though deeply sympathetic, highlights the excesses of the queen's life.  The selection of 80s rock in the soundtrack draws parallels with a time of excess that the audience may more immediately understand.  Coppola's trademark ethereality transports viewers not to mid-18th century France, but to another world altogether.  Coppola could have tried to make a broad and contemporarily pertinent social statment about the extravagance of people in power, but instead she intentionally removes the audience as far from reality as possible, focusing on a character study of a noteworthy historical figure.This, of course, requires a great actress to bring the package together.  While there are scads of actresses who probably could have played the role better (the acerbic but striking Emily Blunt comes to mind), Kirsten Dunst does something different in this film from what most viewers would probably expect.  While she is often prone to roles that make her chatter and talk about her feelings, Coppola has supplied Dunst with a role that finally allows her to act with her body, her face, and her intense eyes.  Viewers may cringe in the film's first hour at Dunst's all-too-familiar childlike waifness, but midway through the film she is forced to grow up and becomes an actress of a higher and more subtle order than we've seen  before.  One should note that Coppola particularly handles the famed ""let them eat cake"" dillemma with ease and unmistakable flair, and the nicely maturing Dunst pulls the package together remarkably.Judy Davis, Rip Torn and Jason Schwartzman hand in performances as skilled as one should expect from them, but this is a film for Dunst, Coppola, and most of all, Marie Antoinette herself.

So I thought I'd comment on the real woman this movie is supposed to be about.The interesting thing about Marie Antoinette is that she was a rather ordinary woman of her class who, through motherhood & unbelievably bad luck (like a revolution), nonetheless matured as an individual & discovered the courage to face the terrors life had in store for her. In many ways her story parallels that of Princess Diana. The royal marriage that was supposed to be something out of a fairy tale, turns out to be more a deadly nightmare instead. Both had husbands who were really not interested in them; Diana's because of adultery, and Marie's due to her husband's physical impediment. They both fiercely loved their children--and, of course, both died tragically.Marie Antoinette also pre-shadowed Diana's hounding by the paparazzi. She was the first monarch to fall victim to the (printing) press. The hated Austrian Queen of France was subject to an unrelenting & savgage attack in slanderous articles, broadsides & vicious cartoons. All the problems in France at that time were said to be instigated by her. The early extravagance of her youth brought her the unfavorable epitah ""Madame Deficit."" When she became a mother she began to understand how foolish she had been & curbed & even stopped frivolous behavior--but too late, the title stuck. She was accused of every crime & sin in the book. We won't go into that, but the point is that there was such more to the real story of this ill-fated woman.An early Hollywood B&W; film ""Marie Antoinette"" even with all its historic inaccuracies & romanticisms hit truer to the mark than Coppola's nonsense. Actress Norma Shearer is very good in the role, ranging from fifteen to thirty-seven. Of course she never really appears to physically age in the film until the final scenes (that would have been a box office no-no), but she conveyed the age progression through her art. In one scene a timeless moment of acting brilliance is captured in the picture. It is the scene following the King's execution. Marie Antoinette, who by this time had developed a solid marriage & deep friendship with Louis, is alone in a dingy cell with her son & daughter. The revolutionists barge in with an order to permanently remove the boy from his mother's care. As they go to take him, Norma Shearer lunges at them screaming, almost snarling, ""You're not going to take my son!""The authenticity of the performance, in that one moment, is a revelation of real acting talent.That one B&W; scene from a typical 1930's Hollywood costume drama rose to a level of artistic achievement that leaves this modern ""Marie"" in the dust.",2,Off with Her head!,1197590400,"12 14, 2007",2007,2903,"['Now', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'erected', 'guillotine', 'were', 'looking', 'director', 'where', 'original', 'review', 'ended', 'short', 'sweet', 'watchers', 'Amazon', 'would', ""n't"", 'accept', 'grounds', 'lacked', 'substance', 'just', 'film', 'thought', ""'d"", 'comment', 'real', 'woman', 'movie', 'supposed', 'be', 'about.The', 'interesting', 'thing', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'was', 'rather', 'ordinary', 'woman', 'class', 'who', 'motherhood', 'unbelievably', 'bad', 'luck', 'revolution', 'nonetheless', 'matured', 'individual', 'discovered', 'courage', 'face', 'terrors', 'life', 'had', 'store', 'many', 'ways', 'story', 'parallels', 'Princess', 'Diana', 'royal', 'marriage', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'something', 'fairy', 'tale', 'out', 'be', 'more', 'deadly', 'nightmare', 'instead', 'had', 'husbands', 'who', 'were', 'really', 'not', 'interested', 'Diana', 'adultery', 'Marie', 'due', 'husband', 'physical', 'impediment', 'fiercely', 'loved', 'children', 'course', 'died', 'tragically.Marie', 'Antoinette', 'also', 'pre-shadowed', 'Diana', 'hounding', 'paparazzi', 'was', 'first', 'monarch', 'fall', 'victim', 'printing', 'press', 'hated', 'Austrian', 'Queen', 'France', 'was', 'subject', 'unrelenting', 'savgage', 'attack', 'slanderous', 'articles', 'broadsides', 'vicious', 'cartoons', 'problems', 'France', 'time', 'were', 'said', 'be', 'instigated', 'early', 'extravagance', 'youth', 'brought', 'unfavorable', 'epitah', 'Madame', 'Deficit', 'When', 'became', 'mother', 'began', 'understand', 'how', 'foolish', 'had', 'been', 'curbed', 'even', 'stopped', 'frivolous', 'behavior', 'too', 'late', 'title', 'stuck', 'was', 'accused', 'crime', 'sin', 'book', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'point', 'was', 'such', 'more', 'real', 'story', 'ill-fated', 'woman.An', 'early', 'Hollywood', 'B', 'W', 'film', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'even', 'historic', 'inaccuracies', 'romanticisms', 'hit', 'truer', 'mark', 'Coppola', 'nonsense', 'Actress', 'Norma', 'Shearer', 'very', 'good', 'role', 'ranging', 'fifteen', 'thirty-seven', 'course', 'never', 'really', 'physically', 'age', 'film', 'final', 'scenes', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'box', 'office', 'no-no', 'conveyed', 'age', 'progression', 'art', 'one', 'scene', 'timeless', 'moment', 'acting', 'brilliance', 'captured', 'picture', 'scene', 'following', 'King', 'execution', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'who', 'time', 'had', 'developed', 'solid', 'marriage', 'deep', 'friendship', 'Louis', 'alone', 'dingy', 'cell', 'son', 'daughter', 'revolutionists', 'barge', 'order', 'permanently', 'remove', 'boy', 'mother', 'care', 'go', 'take', 'Norma', 'Shearer', 'screaming', 'almost', 'snarling', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'take', 'son', 'authenticity', 'performance', 'one', 'moment', 'revelation', 'real', 'acting', 'one', 'B', 'W', 'scene', 'typical', '1930', 'Hollywood', 'costume', 'drama', 'rose', 'level', 'artistic', 'achievement', 'modern', 'Marie', 'dust']",Marie Antoinette

The main objective of this movie is to portray Marie Antoinette's life of royalty as a modern day rock star.Sofia Coppola uses imagery and fantastic colors and costumes and music and stunning videography to do much of the talking.  The irony is even though her lifestyle is outrageous, the way she is presented also makes her very real.Like I said, it's subtle and artsy, and in a world of in-your-face plot, it's easy to understand why so many may not like it.

In particular, the rendition of Fools Rush in by one of the worst singers I've ever heard just goes on and on.

If she was spending all her time at Petite Trianon with her friends and her lover how did she have time to sleep with her husband thus explaining the second child, the boy.

Marren ""jtm497""","[0, 1]","Marie Antoinette is one of those historical figures who will always excite our curiousity--from our very modern perspective we wonder, perhaps, how could someone be so blind to the world around them, how bad could it really be to live in the center of a court dedicated to pleasure? Very bad indeed--and Coppola convinces us of it, which is an accomplishment. Marie is the youngest daughter of the powerful Austrian Empress, sent off at the age of 15 to France. She's a pretty unspoiled child, who is stripped of everything she knows--her maids, her dog, her clothes--and turned into a gorgeously dressed doll to be presented to the rapacious court as the next queen of France. Dunst does a lovely job, by turns frivolous, reckless, sympathetic and loving. She and Louis XVI are really just a pair of clueles teenagers, deliberately shut off from the world by a court filled with schemers. To Dunst's credit, she portrays Marie as a child who manages to mature into a loving mother and caring wife.At first I too was puzzled by the music, the dialogue, the dreamy progress from scene to scene. But would English with a French accent be any more authentic than English with an American or British accent? I don't think so. Once you get past that, the film is a visual feast, and Coppola won an Oscar for costume design.

'The Journey' by Antonia Fraser is one of the best Marie Antoinette books I have ever read. When I heard who the director was for this film I was skeptical, but I finally had to buy the DVD. I like Kirsten Dunst.The film has some very small details and events that are historically accurate. Marie Antoinette did indeed have to strip down nude in order to cross over into France, Louis XV was indeed interested in her bosom, and Marie Antoinette did stand shivering as her clothing was passed from one lady in waiting to another.The French court and atmosphere was accurate on film, cold, haughty and uppity, and yes at times ridiculous. Du Barry was portrayed well as were Marie's close circle of friends. Louis XVI was played perfectly. In my personal opinion, I will believe to my dying day that Louis XVI was a homosexual. Seven years to consumate a marriage and the first king NEVER to have a mistress?? C'mon folks, it isn't hard to figure this out.The costumes are magnificent. Kirstin Dunst is breathtakingly beautiful, and the luxrious life she lead in her early stages of her reign are pretty accuratly portrayed. Some find this film boring, I will admit that those who do not appreciate what this woman went through or what her life was all about, would find it boring. However the stage had to be set for what was about to come.My biggest complaint is that there is no mention of the infamous Diamond Necklace episode. That event is as significant to the French Revolution as the fall of the Bastille. Yet the final scene we see the royal family leaving Versaille never to return. The movie ends just as the adventure, drama, and heartache of Marie Antoinette's life begins.In my opinion this project cannot end here. It is a terrible waste to just leave it hanging here. What about the escape attempt in the Berlin? The September massacres? The Tower imprisonment? The war with Austria? The trial, and finally her long ride to the guillotine? If a part two were to be done correctly and with Kirsten returning to her role as the doomed Queen, Marie Antoinette part 2 could be as lavish, loved, and succesful as the movie Titanic.For what the movie was, it was very good. I can honestly say I was not disappointed neither as a Marie Antoinette fan or a student. I think Kirsten was superb. I think for the period of her life that this film covered, it was very good and accurate. Lavish and boredom was the theme of her life until the Revolution began. But again, this movie is only half the story. I would recommend to anyone whio saw this movie to read 'The Journey' or any other Marie Antoinette biography.

I watched it, and I got it - and while some parts of it worked, overall, I found it unsatisfying.The film started with potential. It took great pains to demonstrate what Marie Antoinette was losing in order to forge an alliance with France. When she arrives at the French border, a tent straddles it. She enters the tent on the Austrian side, is forced to give up her dog and all of her clothes (everything Austrian), and she is garbed in French clothes and told that she can have as many French dogs as she likes. She exits on the French side, ready to meet the dauphin. A wonderful ""show don't tell"" example.I felt that far too much time was spent examining superficial aspects of her life. She spent money, she gambled. She spent too much money. She gambled too much. OK. She's a party girl. I get it. Later in the film, we find that she had three children, and then we are shown that one died in a scene that lasted for twenty seconds: a picture was hung on the wall that showed the Marie with three children; then it was taken down and replaced with a picture of Marie and two children. To some this might seem clever. I thought it was self indulgent. Her affair was glanced over, and her hatred in the hearts of the French people shown in a voiceover that echoed her most infamous quote: Let them eat cake. To a bored observer (I was watching the movie with one such), this is easily missed.The soundtrack, a mix of period music and New Order/Adam and the Ants/Bow Wow Wow seemed as confused as the movie. If something doesn't add anything - i.e., contemporary music to a period drama - then it doesn't belong. My feeling was that the music (all of which I'm a fan of, by the way) detracted from the story being told.So did the unconventional casting decisions. Jason Schwarzman as Louis XVI? Molly Shannon? Rip Torn? I have enjoyed each in other works, but they were as out of place as a mobster at a tea party.What did work were the costumes, the orgiastic parties of champagne and confections, and the portrayal of the queen as a tart. But this is, of course, a superficial examination. This was a skin deep movie that didn't attempt to dig. And Kirsten Dunst, another whose work I enjoy, didn't dig deep here. But that wasn't her fault. She wasn't given a shovel, and one can only do so much with their nails.2 stars rounded up to 3 for costumes and period evocation",3,"Superficial and trite, this film doesn't do Marie Antoinette justice",1177718400,"04 28, 2007",2007,2498,"['take', 'umbrage', 'notion', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'five-star', 'film', 'utter', 'nonsense', 'watched', 'got', 'parts', 'worked', 'overall', 'found', 'unsatisfying.The', 'film', 'started', 'potential', 'took', 'great', 'pains', 'demonstrate', 'what', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'was', 'losing', 'order', 'forge', 'alliance', 'France', 'When', 'French', 'border', 'tent', 'tent', 'Austrian', 'side', 'forced', 'give', 'up', 'dog', 'clothes', 'everything', 'Austrian', 'garbed', 'French', 'clothes', 'told', 'can', 'have', 'as', 'many', 'French', 'dogs', 'French', 'side', 'ready', 'meet', 'dauphin', 'wonderful', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'tell', 'example.I', 'felt', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'was', 'spent', 'examining', 'superficial', 'aspects', 'life', 'spent', 'money', 'gambled', 'spent', 'too', 'much', 'money', 'gambled', 'too', 'much', 'OK.', 'party', 'girl', 'get', 'Later', 'film', 'find', 'had', 'three', 'children', 'then', 'are', 'shown', 'one', 'died', 'scene', 'lasted', 'twenty', 'seconds', 'picture', 'was', 'hung', 'wall', 'showed', 'Marie', 'three', 'children', 'then', 'was', 'taken', 'down', 'replaced', 'picture', 'Marie', 'two', 'children', 'might', 'seem', 'clever', 'thought', 'was', 'self', 'indulgent', 'affair', 'was', 'glanced', 'hatred', 'hearts', 'French', 'people', 'shown', 'voiceover', 'echoed', 'most', 'infamous', 'quote', 'Let', 'eat', 'cake', 'bored', 'observer', 'was', 'watching', 'movie', 'one', 'such', 'easily', 'missed.The', 'soundtrack', 'mix', 'period', 'music', 'New', 'Order/Adam', 'Ants/Bow', 'Wow', 'Wow', 'seemed', 'as', 'confused', 'movie', 'something', ""n't"", 'add', 'anything', 'i.e.', 'contemporary', 'music', 'period', 'drama', 'then', ""n't"", 'belong', 'feeling', 'was', 'music', ""'m"", 'fan', 'way', 'detracted', 'story', 'being', 'told.So', 'did', 'unconventional', 'casting', 'decisions', 'Jason', 'Schwarzman', 'Louis', 'XVI', 'Molly', 'Shannon', 'Rip', 'Torn', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'other', 'works', 'were', 'place', 'mobster', 'tea', 'party.What', 'did', 'work', 'were', 'costumes', 'orgiastic', 'parties', 'champagne', 'confections', 'portrayal', 'queen', 'tart', 'course', 'superficial', 'examination', 'was', 'skin', 'deep', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'attempt', 'dig', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'work', 'enjoy', 'did', ""n't"", 'dig', 'deep', 'here', 'was', ""n't"", 'fault', 'was', ""n't"", 'given', 'shovel', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'do', 'so', 'much', 'nails.2', 'stars', 'rounded', 'up', '3', 'costumes', 'period', 'evocation']",Marie Antoinette

648393,A34792YZU3EH56,B00005JPAS,J. Swagman,"[4, 4]","In Anerica there has always been an almost unhealthy fascination with Marie Antionette.I suspect this is mostly inherited from the British historians and their fascination with the royal family and the lifestyles of the rich and famous. Not to mention the British historical fiction writers and the hundreds of trashy historical romances written about Marie Antoinettte.Every story deserves to be told, but often some stories are told at the expense of others. For example in America every Joe Shmoe knows who Marie Antoinette is, but only history geeks know who Robspierre, Marat, or Danton are. Is this a good sign for a democratic country. Not that Robspierre, Marat, or Danton were saints, but then that's really the whole point. Their lives could offer a valuable study of the possible problems inherit in democratic revolutions or republican societies. Wouldn't it be better to focus attention on these stories instead (as the French themselves do when they write novels about the revolution)?But, I guess Hollywood decided just what the public needed was another sappy story about Marie Antionette, and so we have this movie.On the historical side, I thought it was pretty accurate. I know this movie has been slammed for its lack of historical accuracy, but as far as I can tell that's mostly just because of the rock music and anachronistic props.Granted I'm no expert, but for example I remember reading about how Marie Antionette used to loose her patience with the long dressing ceremonies in the morning when she would be shivering in the cold as her courtiers would debate proper protocal. And that is faithfully reproduced in this movie.Being the historical geek I am, I always rush to the internet after watching a movie like this to check out how much of it is true. And as far as I could tell, it checked out pretty well. Some debatable court rumors and gossip were portrayed as fact, but that is always the prerogative of historical fiction.So adding in the Internet time, I'd consider I got a pretty good history lesson out of this movie. I learned a bit about life at the French Royal court, and some of the rivarlies and gossip of the time.However since this film intentionally stays clear of politics and focuses only on court life, the big question is: how much do I really care about the gossip of Versailles? I'd say the director's assumption that I would stay interested for 2 hours is pushing it a little. The film ends just as Louis and Marie are forcibly escorted to Paris, but in fact they lived for several years afterwords and from a historians perspective, the film ends just as Marie's life is beginning to get interesting.Of course Marie Antionette's lavish spending was one of the causes of the Revolution, and this is hinted at in the movie, but only touched on briefly. I heard one historian say Marie Antionette was the Imelda Marcos of her time, and I think there's a lot of truth in it, but the distinction between Marie's spending and the people's misery could have come through a lot clearer.What is left then? A portrait of a woman isolated and made miserable admist all her privalage. It is impossible not to feel a little sorry for Marie Antionette as an Austrian princess who was married off for political reasons and had to adjust to all the absurdity of Versailles. But on the scale of human suffering, it doesn't really stack up to a lot of the other stories.",2,"Reasonably historically accurate, but of limited interest",1187395200,"08 18, 2007",2007,3410,"['Anerica', 'always', 'been', 'almost', 'unhealthy', 'fascination', 'Marie', 'Antionette.I', 'suspect', 'mostly', 'inherited', 'British', 'historians', 'fascination', 'royal', 'family', 'lifestyles', 'rich', 'famous', 'Not', 'mention', 'British', 'historical', 'fiction', 'writers', 'hundreds', 'trashy', 'historical', 'romances', 'written', 'Marie', 'Antoinettte.Every', 'story', 'deserves', 'be', 'told', 'often', 'stories', 'are', 'told', 'expense', 'others', 'example', 'America', 'Joe', 'Shmoe', 'knows', 'who', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'only', 'history', 'geeks', 'know', 'who', 'Robspierre', 'Marat', 'Danton', 'are', 'good', 'sign', 'democratic', 'country', 'Not', 'Robspierre', 'Marat', 'Danton', 'were', 'saints', 'then', 'really', 'whole', 'point', 'lives', 'could', 'offer', 'valuable', 'study', 'possible', 'problems', 'inherit', 'democratic', 'revolutions', 'republican', 'societies', 'Would', ""n't"", 'be', 'better', 'focus', 'attention', 'stories', 'instead', 'French', 'do', 'when', 'write', 'novels', 'revolution', 'guess', 'Hollywood', 'decided', 'just', 'what', 'public', 'needed', 'was', 'sappy', 'story', 'Marie', 'Antionette', 'so', 'have', 'historical', 'side', 'thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'accurate', 'know', 'movie', 'been', 'slammed', 'lack', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'tell', 'mostly', 'just', 'rock', 'music', 'anachronistic', 'props.Granted', ""'m"", 'expert', 'example', 'remember', 'reading', 'how', 'Marie', 'Antionette', 'used', 'loose', 'patience', 'long', 'dressing', 'ceremonies', 'morning', 'when', 'would', 'be', 'shivering', 'cold', 'courtiers', 'would', 'debate', 'proper', 'protocal', 'faithfully', 'reproduced', 'movie.Being', 'historical', 'geek', 'am', 'always', 'rush', 'internet', 'watching', 'movie', 'check', 'out', 'how', 'much', 'true', 'as', 'far', 'could', 'tell', 'checked', 'out', 'pretty', 'well', 'debatable', 'court', 'rumors', 'gossip', 'were', 'portrayed', 'fact', 'always', 'prerogative', 'historical', 'fiction.So', 'adding', 'Internet', 'time', ""'d"", 'consider', 'got', 'pretty', 'good', 'history', 'lesson', 'movie', 'learned', 'bit', 'life', 'French', 'Royal', 'court', 'rivarlies', 'gossip', 'time.However', 'film', 'intentionally', 'clear', 'politics', 'only', 'court', 'life', 'big', 'question', 'how', 'much', 'do', 'really', 'care', 'gossip', 'Versailles', ""'d"", 'say', 'director', 'assumption', 'would', 'stay', 'interested', '2', 'hours', 'pushing', 'little', 'film', 'just', 'Louis', 'Marie', 'are', 'forcibly', 'escorted', 'Paris', 'fact', 'lived', 'several', 'years', 'afterwords', 'historians', 'perspective', 'film', 'just', 'Marie', 'life', 'beginning', 'get', 'interesting.Of', 'course', 'Marie', 'Antionette', 'lavish', 'spending', 'was', 'one', 'causes', 'Revolution', 'hinted', 'movie', 'only', 'touched', 'briefly', 'heard', 'one', 'historian', 'say', 'Marie', 'Antionette', 'was', 'Imelda', 'Marcos', 'time', 'think', 'lot', 'truth', 'distinction', 'Marie', 'spending', 'people', 'misery', 'could', 'have', 'come', 'lot', 'clearer.What', 'left', 'then', 'portrait', 'woman', 'isolated', 'made', 'miserable', 'admist', 'privalage', 'impossible', 'not', 'feel', 'little', 'sorry', 'Marie', 'Antionette', 'Austrian', 'princess', 'who', 'was', 'married', 'off', 'political', 'reasons', 'had', 'adjust', 'absurdity', 'Versailles', 'scale', 'human', 'suffering', ""n't"", 'really', 'stack', 'up', 'lot', 'other', 'stories']",Marie Antoinette

648396,AYPS4RCXEFSJP,B00005JPAS,K. Boullosa,"[1, 2]","""Marie Antoinette"" is utterly ravishing to look at and, at last, peculiarly touching in a way its histrionics and the director's disastrous choices should have precluded.  A real woman emerges from the manifestly surreal structure of this film - but that isn't because of Coppola's use of vernacular English and modern pop music in stark contrast to the environment of 18th century Versailles - it's because of Kirsten Dunst's talents.It is clear that, as others have pointed out, Coppola researched the living daylights out of the era.  Scrupulous attention is paid to food, dress, entertainment, hairdos, etc.  What that research must also have turned up, and that Coppola chose to ignore in service to her quaint vision, is that Versailles was one of the most formal places ever to exist on the planet.  Even in French its denizens would not have used the vernacular to each other, let alone her friends fall all over the French Queen with a familiarity that would never have existed! Louis XVI's court was ruled by a rigid formality that would make the constraints of Victoria's reign look easy-going by comparison. Were it not for the wistful charm brought to her portrayal of Marie Antoinette by the truly gifted young Dunst, this would have been a total, rather than an honorable failure.In omitting the crushing formality of Louis XVI's court, which served to insulate him and his wife from events taking place just beyond their vast, manicured lawns, Coppola omits a crucial element of the monarchy's downfall.  It is rather like making ""Nicholas and Alexandra"" and leaving out the Romanov's history of absolute rule.  In her distrust of her audience's ability to empathize with someone who doesn't talk like them, Coppola ends by sacrificing necessary historical context to support why Marie and Louis are on their way to their deaths in the final frames, and makes insupportable assumptions about how they related to each other and their friends.  A few references to Marie's spendthrift ways just aren't enough to support the astonishing downfall of the last of the French kings.  Barely any mention is made of the revolution brewing outside the gates until someone runs in with the news that the Bastille has been stormed.  To fail to enlighten us about the events leading up to Marie's fate is in some sense to fail to enlighten us about the woman herself - they are inextricably intertwined.One example of the historical disconnect is the the familiar way in which Marie and her ladies and courtiers lie around together gossiping and eating and shopping - it looks like nothing so much as an episode of ""Sex and the City"" in 18th century clothing.  The fun Marie seems to have with these friends as she wanders through gardens, throws parties, and tries  on new clothes, etc., doesn't support her passionate desire to escape to Trianon, her pastoral alternative from Versailles to a place more ""natural"".The director's ""time warp"" gimmick only serves to draw attention to the gimmick itself, and distract from characterization and story.  Anything less likely to focus the audience on Marie's amorous state of mind after she meets the handsome Swedish guardsman than a recent (and substandard, in my opinion) cover of ""Fools Rush In"" can scarecely be imagined - all one thinks is, ""Oh, listen, it's ""Fools Rush In"" right in the middle of a film about Marie Antoinette in the 18th century!  How cute!""Marie's difficulties at the French court have been well recorded by history: the hostility she met there, exacerbated by her failure to bear an heir for so long, her homesickness, her initial isolation, and her young husband's difficulties in the marriage bed.  The rest of the cast, especially Jason Schwartzman as the benighted Louis, do as well as they can in the jangled time warp gimmick that robs their story of one of its crucial underpinnings.  But essentially they are working against their own interests.The backdrop of modern English and pop music against 18th century Versailles is interesting for about ten minutes.  One gets the point quickly and then it palls just as quickly.  This film is worth seeing for Dunst's sweet performance and for the amazing physical production, but, finally, this is yet another film that substitutes gimmick for content.  It is as if American filmmakers can't function intellectually on a par with history - they seem to feel compelled to reassure their audiences that this won't be too hard to understand or absorb.

648399,A1OBJ2263JCK5,B00005JPAS,Kenneth M. Gelwasser,"[5, 8]","I have to admit I came to Sofia Coppola's ""Marie Antoinette"" with a touch of bias. I absolutely loved her previous film ""Lost in Translation"" (it has now become an absolute favorite) and my curiosity was peaked by the high energy trailers for the new film, that anachronistically mixed 18th century images with a '80s punk/pop soundtrack.Well, I wasn't disapointed. Once again Coppola has produced a wonderful film, that just takes your breath away with both it's beautiful 'in your face' cinematic visual imagery and an emotional character study of a young French Queen, who is primarily remembered by history for her materialistic extravagance and unfortunate end.Coppola's film (based on Antonia Frasier's biography ""Marie Antoinette: The Journey"") takes an impressionistic viewpoint of the young Queen. Marie (Kristin Dunst) is a beautiful, fifteen year old Hungarian princess, brought to the Court of Versailles to marry the equally young, Louis XVI. Her family wants the marriage to secure a Franco-Austrian alliance, while the French want her for one reason only...to produce an heir for the throne. Until she does this, her title and place within the socially/politically vicious French court is on unsound footing.The film follows Marie's emotional metamorphisis from a shy, lonely teenager to an extravagant young woman, who loves both high fashion and partying. She becomes the 'A' list celebrity of her day. Finally we see Marie become more reflective as a caring wife and mother. But by the time she finds maturity and some emotional closure in her life, the angry mobs of (unseen) peasants are at the palace gates.Once again Sofia Coppola produces a stunning film. Not unlike ""Lost in Translation"", she transports us to what seems like the caccoon of another world, where we follow the life of a lonely young woman. Everything about this film is brilliant. Kristin Dunst gives a great performance and really is the movie's emotional core. The supporting cast, which includes Jason Shwartzman, Rip Torn, Judy Davis and Molly Shannon are quite good as well. I'm also impressed by the beautiful cinematography, art direction, costumes and locations.(Where are the multiple 'Academy Award' nominations?) All these aspects readily contribute to recreating the extravagance of the French Court. It's a visual feast for the eyes!Finally, I want to mention the vivacious, high energy soundtrack made up of mostly punk/pop songs of the eighties. Some critics have been negative about using this type of music for the film. But I really think it contributes to the portrayle of the boisterous spirit and wild lifestyles of the characters. If Marie Antoinette were alive today, she just might be listening to ""Bow Wow Wow"", while she drank champagne at some debauched party!

648401,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B00005JPAS,Kevin Killian,"[1, 4]","As she did with the two competing young American women in contemporary Tokyo (Anna Faris and Scarlet Johansson), omce again Sofia Coppola has written and directed a story, based on her own life, of an unsatisfied young bride hungry for attention who must contrast her own stifled dreams with the dramatically sensuous life of a rival.  In this case Coppola casts Asia Argento as the legendary Madama Du Barry, the favorite of the king.  Argento, the daughter of Italian horrormeister Dario Argento, is but one of several actors cast here because they, like Coppola herself, are ""Hollywood royalty"" and thus lend the picture an extra dimension by their mere presence in the cast list--Danny Huston, the son of the late John Huston, plays the Emperor of Austria here, in a few amusing scenes.It is said that just as she pursued Bill Murray for years, hounding him into taking the lead role in LOST IN TRANSLATION, Coppola used all her wiles, but unsuccessfully, hoping to lure French film icon Alain Delon into playing Louis XV, the man who kept Madame Du Barry constantly on hand no matter how much scandal it created in court.  Alas, Rip Torn took the part and plays it exactly as if he thought he was still filming THE LARRY SANDERS SHOW.  He's great and all, but a little out of place, whereas he should have been the still, ominous center of the film, the master of everything he controlled.It was whispered that Du Barry had been arrested 14 times on charges ranging from prostitution to witchcraft by the time she was presented at court in 1769, about a year before the action of Coppola's film takes place.  What a spectacle Asia makes of herself--licking Torn's face, feeding him wine and bits of food, letting him slobber up and down her generous cleavage.  ""Don't hold back,"" Coppola must have told her.  ""Remember, you're a magnificent wench!""  To ensure she gave the performance Coppola wanted, the director arranged for Asia Argento to watch a special screening, at the Cinematheque Francaise, of King Vidor's DUEL IN THE SUN, in which Jennifer Jones rips up the screen with passion as the ""half-breed"" Pearl Chavez.  Elderly theatergoers with long memories might recall that Ethel Merman, of all people, also essayed the part of Madame Du Barry, but Merman was refined as Gwyneth Paltrow compared to the finger licking, throw your head back and laugh evilly je je sais quoi of Asia Argento.Next to whom, poor Kirsten Dunst can do very little except refuse to speak to her.",5,Ham Versus Egg,1185753600,"07 30, 2007",2007,2485,"['did', 'two', 'competing', 'young', 'American', 'women', 'contemporary', 'Tokyo', 'Anna', 'Faris', 'Scarlet', 'Johansson', 'omce', 'again', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'written', 'directed', 'story', 'based', 'own', 'life', 'unsatisfied', 'young', 'bride', 'hungry', 'attention', 'who', 'must', 'contrast', 'own', 'stifled', 'dreams', 'dramatically', 'sensuous', 'life', 'rival', 'case', 'Coppola', 'Asia', 'Argento', 'legendary', 'Madama', 'Du', 'Barry', 'favorite', 'king', 'Argento', 'daughter', 'Italian', 'horrormeister', 'Dario', 'Argento', 'one', 'several', 'actors', 'cast', 'here', 'Coppola', 'are', 'Hollywood', 'royalty', 'thus', 'lend', 'picture', 'extra', 'dimension', 'mere', 'presence', 'cast', 'list', 'Danny', 'Huston', 'son', 'late', 'John', 'Huston', 'Emperor', 'Austria', 'here', 'few', 'amusing', 'scenes.It', 'said', 'just', 'pursued', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'years', 'hounding', 'taking', 'lead', 'role', 'LOST', 'IN', 'TRANSLATION', 'Coppola', 'used', 'wiles', 'unsuccessfully', 'hoping', 'lure', 'French', 'film', 'icon', 'Alain', 'Delon', 'playing', 'Louis', 'XV', 'man', 'who', 'kept', 'Madame', 'Du', 'Barry', 'constantly', 'hand', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'scandal', 'created', 'court', 'Alas', 'Rip', 'Torn', 'took', 'part', 'exactly', 'thought', 'was', 'still', 'filming', 'THE', 'LARRY', 'SANDERS', 'SHOW', 'great', 'little', 'place', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'still', 'ominous', 'center', 'film', 'master', 'everything', 'was', 'whispered', 'Du', 'Barry', 'had', 'been', 'arrested', '14', 'times', 'charges', 'ranging', 'prostitution', 'witchcraft', 'time', 'was', 'presented', 'court', '1769', 'year', 'action', 'Coppola', 'film', 'place', 'What', 'spectacle', 'Asia', 'licking', 'Torn', 'face', 'feeding', 'wine', 'bits', 'food', 'letting', 'slobber', 'generous', 'cleavage', 'Do', ""n't"", 'hold', 'back', 'Coppola', 'must', 'have', 'told', 'Remember', ""'re"", 'magnificent', 'wench', 'ensure', 'gave', 'performance', 'Coppola', 'wanted', 'director', 'arranged', 'Asia', 'Argento', 'watch', 'special', 'screening', 'Cinematheque', 'Francaise', 'King', 'Vidor', 'DUEL', 'IN', 'THE', 'SUN', 'Jennifer', 'Jones', 'up', 'screen', 'passion', 'half-breed', 'Pearl', 'Chavez', 'Elderly', 'theatergoers', 'long', 'memories', 'might', 'recall', 'Ethel', 'Merman', 'people', 'also', 'essayed', 'part', 'Madame', 'Du', 'Barry', 'Merman', 'was', 'refined', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'compared', 'finger', 'licking', 'throw', 'head', 'back', 'evilly', 'je', 'je', 'sais', 'quoi', 'Asia', 'Argento.Next', 'whom', 'poor', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'can', 'do', 'very', 'little', 'refuse', 'speak']",Marie Antoinette
648402,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00005JPAS,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","I still vividly recall the abundant trailers and promos that accompanied Sofia Coppola's ""Marie Antoinette"" upon its theatrical release. From the gorgeous visuals, the eye popping color palette, and the anachronistic rock soundtrack--it seemed, to me, that ""Marie"" could be an adventurous and bold success or a complete disaster. And, in truth, as I survey the hundreds of previously submitted reviews--it does appear that people fall on one side of this spectrum or the other. So is Coppola's film a daring masterpiece or pretentious drivel? I can see a rational explanation for both points of view. However, in my case, I'll say that ""Marie Antoinette"" first exceeded my expectations and then let me down. hollaI will preface my next remarks by saying that, in no way, did I go into ""Marie Antoinette"" anticipating a traditional historical biography. Anyone entering the film expecting great insight into Antoinette's real life or even French history is likely to be disappointed. But, seen as a bit of fiction, there are simple pleasures to be had from the film.The film is not nearly as radical as one might suspect. The lovely first hour tells the relatively straightforward story of Marie (Kirsten Dunst) as she leaves her home, moves to France, and takes her place as the future Queen. Seen through Marie's inexperienced eyes, the court is a place of wondrous beauty and baffling protocol. Trying to connect with her new husband Louis and maintain the spirit of her youth, Marie is an oddity that people come to accept and admire. I really enjoyed this first hour of ""Marie Antoinette."" Aside from the gorgeous sets and costumes, there is much charm and humor in the small details of the film's setup. However, just as I was completely captivated, the film lost all momentum. When Marie has a child, the narrative just seems to stop for a while--idling in the countryside that Marie so enjoys. And, then, as things turn more serious, the film lost me entirely. Every real issue is presented in only the vaguest of terms. Here is where a bit of valid historical context would have aided the movie tremendously. As the couple fall out of favor, I know there are dozens of significant reasons--but the film isn't at all concerned about the facts of the matter. And if the film doesn't care, why should I?Dunst does a nice job with Antoinette, especially in the more innocent times at court. Jason Schwartzman seems an unlikely match as husband Louis. He begins as a bit of a cartoon but has a compelling sweetness that won me over--although the ""real"" Louis remains a complete enigma to me. Rip Torn and Judy Davis class up the film to great affect. While both offer moments of sheer delight, I wished they were utilized even further. So while the performances are nice, the technical merits noteworthy, and the visual pleasures abundant--the screenplay ultimately loses the battle of style over substance. It's unfortunate, though, the potential for greatness was here--but, for me, ""Marie Antoinette"" ends up missing the mark.

648403,A22TZUXUKA11SQ,B00005JPAS,"K. Hinton ""avid reader""","[1, 1]","Sofia Coppola's version of Marie Antoinette focuses on the grandeur and opulence of Versailles, the strained relationship between Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, and the repurcussions that their youth and wild ways had on the future of their country. When Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI meet they are mere children who know nothing about one another. For more than a year of their marriage they are virtual strangers who sleep in the same bed, but have yet to consummate their marriage. Louis is portrayed as a distant husband who cares more about his hunting and lock-making than the future of his country. Marie Antoinette is portrayed as a confused, spendthrift who attempts to mend the rift in her marriage by indulging in court gossip, stuffing herself with sweets, and spending copious amounts of money.As a whole, I enjoyed the film. I thought Kirsten Dunst was better than I've ever seen her (though I will allow that comparing this performance to Bring It On and Spiderman is a bit of a stretch) and the costumes, lighting, and direction were superb. I've never been a big fan of historical movies that are retold to suit the writers' purposes, but in this instance I was willing to look past it and just see that this was a well-made film. I do agree with some of the other reviewers, however, that the soundtrack left something to be desired.

While the costumes are lavish and the locations beautiful, the movie is boring at best, irritating at worst. Attempting a cutting-edge approach with completely inappropriate punk rock music as the backdrop of the movie, it rambles on for 2 hours without ever coming close to engaging the viewer in the real drama and difficulty that Marie-Antoinette faced.

What a terrible waist!!! I have read several historically correct books about the French Court, Louis XIV, Marie Antoinette and her tragic life, etc. Believe me when I state that this was not about Marie Antoinette! I viewed this movie last night on television --- simply because of the title. I have seen the Norma Shearer version several times, and I must state that it is absolutely beautiful, and Miss Shearer's acting is superb. That version gives one a true feeling as to a sense of the woman, her world, her troubles, and the times.The one that I viewed last night was a most terrible disappointment! Why would one wish to make an historical movie, and yet disregard the facts and the essence of the period entirely? The French Court was not about pastries, shoes and nonsense --- as depicted in this movie. It entailed much more. Marie Antoinette was an Austrian Princess who had been educated and prepared to fulfill her political role within the French Court. She was intelligent and vivacious. She was not a loose idiot. This movie looked as if it was running amuck to nowhere with its choice of modern day bad language, terrible music and horrible ear piercing singing. Point one --- why would one even consider modern music --- if indeed one would call it that --- as a score for an historical movie? Point two --- the cast went about in their costumes speaking literally incorrect absolute nonsense --- If I may be so bold as to ask --- who spoke in such a manner in the French Court or in any court for that matter? What was the point? Was it because the film makers felt that the audience was illiterate, deaf and dumb? --- That they would not understand? Prior to the French revolution, the French Court was filled with intrigue. Louis XIV was a most fascinating figure,and his mistress was a cunning woman. Enter Marie Antoinette. She was just one of the pieces in a complex political chess game. Nothing was portrayed correctly in this movie. Not a thing! --- Except perhaps the scenic shots of Versailles. No wonder the French were not happy at Cannes. If one wishes to know the truth --- please read the books, and view the other movie. Then perhaps you will understand why this merits only a one star.

She is immediately packed off to the court of Versailles where she is the object of suspicion as a foreigner, and her husband is unable or unwilling to consummate their marriage.  Plucky Marie Antoinette manages to quickly adjust to her lavish and pampered lifestyle by indulging in power-shopping and taking a lover.  At the age of 19, she is Queen of France, a mother, and totally unaware of the desperate conditions of the poor in Paris.From the first punk rock tune during the opening credits, I knew this was not going to be a typical historical drama.  Indeed, the soundtrack mixes rock songs with a few classical pieces, creating a quirky, surreal atmosphere.  If you liked the odd mix of a period story with modern music in the movie ""Moulin Rouge,"" you'll like this one.On the plus side, it's easy to feel immersed in court life, where all the nobility had to do all day was dress in stunningly gorgeous outfits, gossip about everyone, and see and be seen.  The costumes are incredibly opulent and much of the filming was done in and around Versailles, so this is a visual feast, to say the least.  I did find it annoying that no mention is ever made of dates and the passage of time (19 years) is vague since the actors don't seem to age.  Dunst is horribly miscast as Marie Antoinette.  She looks and sounds like a mid-west Girl Scout, using words like, ""yeah"" and ""gonna,"" and generally looking silly amid the sophisticated surroundings.

That being said, it was the only Oscar for which it could possibly have been nominated, as the film itself was a disappointment. As a lover of period dramas, I eagerly rented this film. Not even its visual beauty, however, could keep me fully engaged in a film that simply does not tell a cohesive story. Unless one is fully familiar with the story of Marie Antoinette, the film will impart little to one's knowledge of the time, place, and people. As with a meringue, a frothy, delicious confection that promises much, one will find little of substance after one bite.Kirsten Dunce gives a tender performance as Marie Antoinette, a young Austrian princess thrust into a role that she did not seek, who is forced to leave all that she knew and loved in order to forge an alliance between Austria and France. An ephemeral portrait of this much maligned historical figure emerges, one that is somewhat sympathetic. Moreover, the use of rock music in the film is an interesting choice, as it serves to remind the viewer that Marie Antoinette was a young girl, not much different than young girls of today, with hopes and desires of her own. Yet, hers had to be sublimated. Without something of a cogent and compelling narrative, however, the story of Marie Antoinette falls by the wayside.While the social climate of France, which serves as a necessary counterpoint for the excesses of Marie Antoinette's court, is alluded to, it is little more of a blip in the film. This social event that caused two worlds to eventually collide, as the French Revolution became a reality rather than just a political theory, remains as elusive as the focal point of the film itself. The historical context of Marie Antoinette's reality, that is, the events that propelled her into the annals of history, is barely a footnote.Although the story of Marie Antoinette is historically a poignant one, the director, Sofia Coppola, simply  fails to tell a cohesive story, as the film meanders along, a tribute to extravagance and beauty but little else. This film, therefore, remains an elevation of form over substance. While loosely based upon a biography of Marie Antoinette by Antonia Fraser, it is little wonder that the author went on the record to disavow herself of this film.  I can also fully understand why this film was booed at the Cannes Film Festival. It is simply little more that a yawn yarn, though a visually enticing one.

The film brings to the screen two main stories, which are unfolding simultaneously: On the one hand, Marie Antoinette, and her life at Versailles, and on the other (and to a much lesser extent), several events leading to the French Revolution (1789).The movie portrays superbly life at the Palace, and provides valuable insight into a very important period of French (European) History.We get a taste (though a very light one) of France's involvement in the American Revolution (beginning in 1778).Moreover, we get to see or hear about the lies and propaganda that helped shift public opinion against the Queen.The film is also excellent in showing that King Louis XVI did not wish to rule and was forced into that position following the death of his grandfather Louis XV.The major setbacks are in relation to:1) The TERRIBLE music with the exception of those moments when the music of the time can be heard.2) The movie is at times very slow, which breeds annoyance.3) Marie Antoinette had four children yet we only see three.4) Focusing too much on life in the Palace at the expense of historical events.Kirsten Dunst does a GREAT job as Marie Antoinette, though Jason Schwartzman (of all people!) portraying Louis XVI was a poor choice to say the least.Nevertheless, the setting, the dialogues, and the costumes are all wonderful!Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a thought-provoking movie that will provide for an evening's entertainment.The abrupt ending allows for a great cliffhanger so a sequel is in order.Strongly recommended along with Napoleon the TV Miniseries (starring Christian Clavier, Isabella Rossellini, Gerard Depardieu, and John Malkovich), Queen Margot (Isabelle Adjani), Brotherhood of the Wolf (Monica Bellucci and Vincent Cassel), and Vidocq (Gerard Depardieu) for those with a soft spot for French History.",4,BRING ON THE SEQUEL!,1177632000,"04 27, 2007",2007,2158,"['Marie', 'Antoinette', 'screen', 'story', 'Austrian', 'princess', 'blossomed', 'Queen', 'France', 'only', 'become', 'one', 'most', 'well', 'known', 'victims', 'French', 'Revolution.The', 'movie', 'pragmatic', 'realistic', 'effect', 'more', 'truthful', 'account', 'life', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'film', 'screen', 'two', 'main', 'stories', 'are', 'unfolding', 'simultaneously', 'one', 'hand', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'life', 'Versailles', 'other', 'much', 'lesser', 'extent', 'several', 'events', 'leading', 'French', 'Revolution', '1789', '.The', 'movie', 'superbly', 'life', 'Palace', 'valuable', 'insight', 'very', 'important', 'period', 'French', 'European', 'History.We', 'get', 'taste', 'very', 'light', 'one', 'France', 'involvement', 'American', 'Revolution', 'beginning', '1778', '.Moreover', 'get', 'see', 'hear', 'lies', 'propaganda', 'helped', 'shift', 'public', 'opinion', 'Queen.The', 'film', 'also', 'excellent', 'showing', 'King', 'Louis', 'XVI', 'did', 'not', 'wish', 'rule', 'was', 'forced', 'position', 'following', 'death', 'grandfather', 'Louis', 'XV.The', 'major', 'setbacks', 'are', 'relation', 'to:1', 'TERRIBLE', 'music', 'exception', 'moments', 'when', 'music', 'time', 'can', 'be', 'heard.2', 'movie', 'times', 'very', 'slow', 'annoyance.3', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'had', 'four', 'children', 'yet', 'only', 'see', 'three.4', 'Focusing', 'too', 'much', 'life', 'Palace', 'expense', 'historical', 'events.Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'GREAT', 'job', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'people', 'portraying', 'Louis', 'XVI', 'was', 'poor', 'choice', 'say', 'least.Nevertheless', 'setting', 'dialogues', 'costumes', 'are', 'wonderful', 'Very', 'well', 'written', 'very', 'well', 'presented', 'thought-provoking', 'movie', 'will', 'provide', 'evening', 'entertainment.The', 'abrupt', 'ending', 'allows', 'great', 'cliffhanger', 'sequel', 'order.Strongly', 'recommended', 'Napoleon', 'TV', 'Miniseries', 'starring', 'Christian', 'Clavier', 'Isabella', 'Rossellini', 'Gerard', 'Depardieu', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'Queen', 'Margot', 'Isabelle', 'Adjani', 'Brotherhood', 'Wolf', 'Monica', 'Bellucci', 'Vincent', 'Cassel', 'Vidocq', 'Gerard', 'Depardieu', 'soft', 'spot', 'French', 'History']",Marie Antoinette
648416,AIWIVN4UAFCA4,B00005JPAS,"Linda Lou ""Obsessive reader, 6-10 books a wee...","[1, 5]","Nothing makes me happier than huge powdered wigs, beautiful gowns with wide farthingales, riding to hounds, fans, feathers, fruit, and fops. But there was way too much of that here. I almost overdosed on opulence. I got what director Sofia Coppola was trying to do, but I felt like I was watching today's Hollywood crew of ""ne'er do wells"": Paris Hilton, Lindsay Lohan, Nicole Richie, etc.This movie was less about ""Marie Antoinette"" than it was about her husband's impotence (the result of a physical problem eventually corrected by surgery, something not revealed here). It was painful to watch and wait for 75 minutes until Louis XVI, an expert locksmith, was able to get his ""key"" in the door. Later, Marie's ""booty calls"" with the sexy Count Fersen (Jamie Doman) seemed like porn after scene after scene waiting for the Dauphin's ""cannon"" to blow. With no reference to time passing, it seemed that the non-consummation of the royal marriage went on for decades. It wasn't until Marie had some kids did we get some idea of the time, although the kids were growing up like children on soap operas - one minute they are in a cradle, the next they are going to law school. And it appeared as if the Swedish Count was the real ""baby daddy"" of Marie Antoinette's second child, the male heir to the throne.Many of the scenes, while lush and beautifully filmed, went on way too long, adding nothing to the story (there were so many hunt scenes, I was about to shoot myself!). Kirsten Dunst, in the title role, was lovely, child-like, and ethereal. She had you believing that Marie Antoinette really said ""Let them eat cake"", with her birthday cake and kazillion pastries shown throughout looking as if they were baked by ""The Ace of Cakes"". While I loved the contemporary soundtrack (produced by Brian Reitzeil), the 1940s standard hit single ""Fools Rush In"", sung by a vocally-challenged chanteuse, was reminiscent of early Mary J. Blige, which made the fillings in my teeth hurt! The sets were gorgeous (it's hard to mess up Versailles and Le Petit Trianon), but the story was weak, inaccurate and, at times, just ridiculous. Take note of the scene with Marie buying shoes like she was at a Jimmy Choo sample sale - it shows a pair royal Chuck Taylors! I was expecting Snoop Dogg to be at the Bal Masque!The only compliment I have is very minor. The production and costume designers kept the colors worn and around the aristocracy soft, with pinks, blues, mints, and yellows. With everything looking like a surgary icing-covered pastry, you could almost taste the decadence and waste of the time while the common people of France were starving. But we never actually saw any poor people....except for the ghetto-fabulous Madam Du Barry (Asia Argente), mistress of the licentious Louis XV (Rip Torn), Marie Antoinette's father-in-law. A former ""woman of the streets"", du Barry she actually burps loudly at a state dinner, among other coarse actions. While everyone else at Versailles seemed to have been given the Limited Edition Easter Set of Crayolas, du Barry only got the box of 8 colors - and she preferred using the red, black, and blue crayons, with great abandon. She stood out of the movie like a sore thumb which, of course, was the point. Now, that I got.I know that young Marie Antoinette was merely a political pawn between France and her own Austria. She had been shipped off to have a baby for the future teen king of France, in order to cement relations between the two countries. At age 14, Marie did what teenagers do when they have nothing to do and the American Express Black - wear the numbers off the card! But after 2 hours of watching overspending and aborted sexual relations, I couldn't wait to see ""The National Razor"", le guillotine. I wanted to chop off Coppola's head for wasting all of that satin! But the movie never even went that far - it failed like Louis in bed.Judy Davis, Marianne Faithful, Rip Torn, Jason Schwartzman, Jamie Doman, and the rest were well cast here. Molly Shannon was so believable that I still don't remember seeing her. All of the little dogs were good, too. But the end titles, which came out of the blue, were more interesting than this movie. I didn't bother to see if there were deleted scenes on this disc - I wished the whole movie had been deleted!",3,"LUSCIOUSLY DONE, BUT A BIT WEAK ON SUBSTANCE",1217721600,"08 3, 2008",2008,4310,"['Nothing', 'happier', 'huge', 'powdered', 'wigs', 'beautiful', 'gowns', 'wide', 'farthingales', 'riding', 'hounds', 'fans', 'feathers', 'fruit', 'fops', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'here', 'almost', 'overdosed', 'opulence', 'got', 'what', 'director', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'was', 'trying', 'do', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'today', 'Hollywood', 'crew', ""ne'er"", 'do', 'wells', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'Nicole', 'Richie', 'etc.This', 'movie', 'was', 'less', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'was', 'husband', 'impotence', 'result', 'physical', 'problem', 'eventually', 'corrected', 'surgery', 'something', 'not', 'revealed', 'here', 'was', 'painful', 'watch', 'wait', '75', 'minutes', 'Louis', 'XVI', 'expert', 'locksmith', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'key', 'door', 'Later', 'Marie', 'booty', 'calls', 'sexy', 'Count', 'Fersen', 'Jamie', 'Doman', 'seemed', 'porn', 'scene', 'scene', 'waiting', 'Dauphin', 'cannon', 'blow', 'reference', 'time', 'passing', 'seemed', 'non-consummation', 'royal', 'marriage', 'went', 'decades', 'was', ""n't"", 'Marie', 'had', 'kids', 'did', 'get', 'idea', 'time', 'kids', 'were', 'growing', 'up', 'children', 'soap', 'operas', 'one', 'minute', 'are', 'cradle', 'next', 'are', 'going', 'law', 'school', 'appeared', 'Swedish', 'Count', 'was', 'real', 'baby', 'daddy', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'second', 'child', 'male', 'heir', 'throne.Many', 'scenes', 'lush', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'went', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'adding', 'nothing', 'story', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'hunt', 'scenes', 'was', 'about', 'shoot', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'title', 'role', 'was', 'lovely', 'child-like', 'ethereal', 'had', 'believing', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'really', 'said', 'Let', 'eat', 'cake', 'birthday', 'cake', 'kazillion', 'pastries', 'shown', 'looking', 'were', 'baked', 'Ace', 'Cakes', 'loved', 'contemporary', 'soundtrack', 'produced', 'Brian', 'Reitzeil', '1940s', 'standard', 'hit', 'single', 'Fools', 'Rush', 'sung', 'vocally-challenged', 'chanteuse', 'was', 'reminiscent', 'early', 'Mary', 'J.', 'Blige', 'made', 'fillings', 'teeth', 'hurt', 'sets', 'were', 'gorgeous', 'hard', 'mess', 'up', 'Versailles', 'Le', 'Petit', 'Trianon', 'story', 'was', 'weak', 'inaccurate', 'times', 'just', 'ridiculous', 'Take', 'note', 'scene', 'Marie', 'buying', 'shoes', 'was', 'Jimmy', 'Choo', 'sample', 'sale', 'pair', 'royal', 'Chuck', 'Taylors', 'was', 'expecting', 'Snoop', 'Dogg', 'be', 'Bal', 'Masque', 'only', 'compliment', 'have', 'very', 'minor', 'production', 'costume', 'designers', 'kept', 'colors', 'worn', 'aristocracy', 'soft', 'pinks', 'blues', 'mints', 'yellows', 'everything', 'looking', 'surgary', 'icing-covered', 'pastry', 'could', 'almost', 'taste', 'decadence', 'waste', 'time', 'common', 'people', 'France', 'were', 'starving', 'never', 'actually', 'saw', 'poor', 'people', '.except', 'ghetto-fabulous', 'Madam', 'Du', 'Barry', 'Asia', 'Argente', 'mistress', 'licentious', 'Louis', 'XV', 'Rip', 'Torn', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'father-in-law', 'former', 'woman', 'streets', 'du', 'Barry', 'actually', 'burps', 'loudly', 'state', 'dinner', 'other', 'coarse', 'actions', 'everyone', 'else', 'Versailles', 'seemed', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'Limited', 'Edition', 'Easter', 'Set', 'Crayolas', 'du', 'Barry', 'only', 'got', 'box', '8', 'colors', 'preferred', 'using', 'red', 'black', 'blue', 'crayons', 'great', 'abandon', 'stood', 'movie', 'sore', 'thumb', 'course', 'was', 'point', 'Now', 'got.I', 'know', 'young', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'was', 'merely', 'political', 'pawn', 'France', 'own', 'Austria', 'had', 'been', 'shipped', 'have', 'baby', 'future', 'teen', 'king', 'France', 'order', 'cement', 'relations', 'two', 'countries', 'age', '14', 'Marie', 'did', 'what', 'teenagers', 'do', 'when', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'American', 'Express', 'Black', 'wear', 'numbers', 'card', '2', 'hours', 'watching', 'overspending', 'aborted', 'sexual', 'relations', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'National', 'Razor', 'le', 'guillotine', 'wanted', 'chop', 'off', 'Coppola', 'head', 'wasting', 'satin', 'movie', 'never', 'even', 'went', 'far', 'failed', 'like', 'Louis', 'bed.Judy', 'Davis', 'Marianne', 'Faithful', 'Rip', 'Torn', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'Jamie', 'Doman', 'rest', 'were', 'well', 'cast', 'here', 'Molly', 'Shannon', 'was', 'so', 'believable', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'seeing', 'little', 'dogs', 'were', 'good', 'too', 'end', 'titles', 'came', 'blue', 'were', 'more', 'interesting', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'see', 'were', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'disc', 'wished', 'whole', 'movie', 'had', 'been', 'deleted']",Marie Antoinette

648418,A3PUVLBMBHDNWT,B00005JPAS,Lissa,"[3, 3]","When a friend told me that this movie barely touched on the French Revolution and did not even show Marie Antoinette's imprisonment and execution at the guillotine, I was hesitant and almost reconsidered watching it at all. How could any biograhpy worth its salt omit the most critical period of her life, the period that marked her thereafter as a standout figure in history? I couldn't imagine it. Nevertheless, I decided to hold my breath and give it a chance.I'm very glad I did! My doubts disappeared as I saw how beautifully-done and open-minded this movies is. It's true, it only depicts the decadent years of Marie Antoinette's life at Versailles, but that is just the point. It's not meant to be a lofty biopic, but rather a visual representation of one phase of her life. Sofia Coppola aimed to show, not tell. The costumes, which are lush and gorgeous, and the set, which is the breathtaking palace of Versailles itself, dominate, favored over heavy dialogue or great political discussions which you might find in other period dramas. Many people have dismissed the movie because of this, but on the other hand, if you want all the historical detail, then you could read the plethora of informative books out there about Marie Antoinette. But this is a film, a completely different form of expression. The main purpose of a visual representation should be to show the subject in an intriguing way, through camera angles and set designs and expressions from the actors that evoke emotion, rather than relying only on words. This movie does that. So, I think the rich style and visual emphasis of this film is very refreshing. If there had never been a movie or biography made of Marie Antoinette, then the lack of historical detail would have still been frustrating. But the thing is, there has. Coppola decided to take a different direction and put a new, creative spin on it. You have to give her credit for that.Part of her style in this movie is based on modern influences. The choice of music is great. I love the concept of mixing modern music with period pieces, because it can enhance the vibrancy and energy, along with helping modern audiences feel a stronger connection to the era. It works quite well in this movie, just like it did in Knight's Tale. It doesn't reduce the credibility, and I think that is because music is transcendent, and different types of music can leap across the generations and still apply to old and new alike, in a quirky way. The accents of the actors, too, are modern and varied with no attempt of change. This aspect actually aggravated me at first, but I admit that it's pretty unrealistic to expect the largely non-francophone cast to don perfect french accents. And that wouldn't be right, either. And in any case, it still adds to the brazen portrayal of Marie Antoinette, hearing Kirsten Dunst with her American accent as is, although I can see how it might be offensive to many viewers, and strain their credulity. For me, it was alright.Above all, though, what really rings true for this movie is the echo of the Rococo era, which had all of the Baroque ornamentation but was curiously unique with its glowing air of pastels, frivolity and lightness. The depiction of the court of Versailles, Marie Antoinette's world, is just that. By capturing a specific time frame in her life, and focusing on the one setting of Versailles, an intimate tone is established and this movie feels like one vast portrait. It creates a strong sentiment of naive carelessness as we are locked in her charmed perception. I strongly believe that if Sofia Coppola had continued to take us through the dark days of Marie Antoinette's life, it would have clashed badly with this innocent tone. To me, to actually see the execution after the light portrayal of Versailles would have felt tactless and too jarring. Simply showing her leaving Versailles in her carriage, gazing out the window, resonated much more deeply, and kindly. It's only fitting. She was flippant and careless at Versailles, but she was also trapped in many ways, and didn't deserve her fate. As we watch, we know where she is headed (no pun intended), and seeing her in that last calm before the storm arouses a kind of pity for her clueless behavior in the past, along with a bittersweet sadness for the realization that she is on the edge of disgrace and ruin, but allowed one last graceful moment.",4,Like a Rococo painting come to life,1203984000,"02 26, 2008",2008,4405,"['When', 'friend', 'told', 'movie', 'barely', 'touched', 'French', 'Revolution', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'show', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'imprisonment', 'execution', 'guillotine', 'was', 'hesitant', 'almost', 'reconsidered', 'watching', 'How', 'could', 'biograhpy', 'worth', 'salt', 'most', 'critical', 'period', 'life', 'period', 'marked', 'thereafter', 'standout', 'figure', 'history', 'could', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'Nevertheless', 'decided', 'hold', 'breath', 'give', 'chance.I', ""'m"", 'very', 'glad', 'did', 'My', 'doubts', 'disappeared', 'saw', 'how', 'beautifully-done', 'open-minded', 'movies', 'true', 'only', 'decadent', 'years', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'life', 'Versailles', 'just', 'point', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'lofty', 'biopic', 'rather', 'visual', 'representation', 'one', 'phase', 'life', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'aimed', 'show', 'not', 'tell', 'costumes', 'are', 'lush', 'gorgeous', 'set', 'breathtaking', 'palace', 'Versailles', 'dominate', 'favored', 'heavy', 'dialogue', 'great', 'political', 'discussions', 'might', 'find', 'other', 'period', 'dramas', 'Many', 'people', 'have', 'dismissed', 'movie', 'other', 'hand', 'want', 'historical', 'detail', 'then', 'could', 'read', 'plethora', 'informative', 'books', 'there', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'film', 'completely', 'different', 'form', 'expression', 'main', 'purpose', 'visual', 'representation', 'should', 'be', 'show', 'subject', 'intriguing', 'way', 'camera', 'angles', 'set', 'designs', 'expressions', 'actors', 'evoke', 'emotion', 'rather', 'relying', 'only', 'words', 'movie', 'So', 'think', 'rich', 'style', 'visual', 'emphasis', 'film', 'very', 'refreshing', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'movie', 'biography', 'made', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'then', 'lack', 'historical', 'detail', 'would', 'have', 'still', 'been', 'frustrating', 'thing', 'Coppola', 'decided', 'take', 'different', 'direction', 'put', 'new', 'creative', 'spin', 'have', 'give', 'credit', 'that.Part', 'style', 'movie', 'based', 'modern', 'influences', 'choice', 'music', 'great', 'love', 'concept', 'mixing', 'modern', 'music', 'period', 'pieces', 'can', 'enhance', 'vibrancy', 'energy', 'helping', 'modern', 'audiences', 'feel', 'stronger', 'connection', 'era', 'quite', 'well', 'movie', 'just', 'did', 'Knight', 'Tale', ""n't"", 'reduce', 'credibility', 'think', 'music', 'transcendent', 'different', 'types', 'music', 'can', 'leap', 'generations', 'still', 'apply', 'old', 'new', 'alike', 'quirky', 'way', 'accents', 'actors', 'too', 'are', 'modern', 'varied', 'attempt', 'change', 'aspect', 'actually', 'aggravated', 'first', 'admit', 'pretty', 'unrealistic', 'expect', 'largely', 'non-francophone', 'cast', 'don', 'perfect', 'french', 'accents', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'right', 'either', 'case', 'still', 'brazen', 'portrayal', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'hearing', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'American', 'accent', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'might', 'be', 'offensive', 'many', 'viewers', 'strain', 'credulity', 'was', 'though', 'what', 'really', 'true', 'movie', 'echo', 'Rococo', 'era', 'had', 'Baroque', 'ornamentation', 'was', 'curiously', 'unique', 'glowing', 'air', 'pastels', 'frivolity', 'lightness', 'depiction', 'court', 'Versailles', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'world', 'just', 'capturing', 'specific', 'time', 'frame', 'life', 'focusing', 'one', 'setting', 'Versailles', 'intimate', 'tone', 'established', 'movie', 'one', 'vast', 'portrait', 'strong', 'sentiment', 'naive', 'carelessness', 'are', 'locked', 'charmed', 'perception', 'strongly', 'believe', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'had', 'continued', 'take', 'dark', 'days', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'life', 'would', 'have', 'clashed', 'badly', 'innocent', 'tone', 'actually', 'see', 'execution', 'light', 'portrayal', 'Versailles', 'would', 'have', 'felt', 'tactless', 'too', 'jarring', 'Simply', 'showing', 'leaving', 'Versailles', 'carriage', 'gazing', 'out', 'window', 'resonated', 'much', 'more', 'deeply', 'kindly', 'only', 'fitting', 'was', 'flippant', 'careless', 'Versailles', 'was', 'also', 'trapped', 'many', 'ways', 'did', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'fate', 'watch', 'know', 'where', 'headed', 'pun', 'intended', 'seeing', 'last', 'calm', 'storm', 'kind', 'pity', 'clueless', 'behavior', 'past', 'bittersweet', 'sadness', 'realization', 'edge', 'disgrace', 'ruin', 'allowed', 'one', 'last', 'graceful', 'moment']",Marie Antoinette

Sofia Coppola made very interesting choices but they were choices that will be dated in a few years as today's music in the movie become yesterday's news. That where some of the mistakes of the movie come in was that many of contemporary 21st century concepts were inserted in this movie about a 18th century woman.Perhaps, the saddest thing about this movie was that it ended just when Marie Antoinette's life was about to get very interesting. Kristen Dunst had a chance to show off her acting bit instead be being so one dimensional carefree, free spending character. Coppola had a chance to create a landmark movie but instead, she choose to make momentary statement movie that sounds dated even now.The DVD of this movie proves to be well made. The sound are excellent and images proves to be astoundingly well presented. The extras proves to be average, your usual ""Making of the...."" and few interviews that follows.

648422,AN94YI3URSAII,B00005JPAS,Lostgirl,"[4, 7]","I held off on seeing this in theaters because the trailer failed to impress me and I'd heard negative things about it. After finally seeing it I won't say that there's no good in it.  It's a visually stunning film with gorgeous shots of Versailles and  costumes that totally deserved the Oscar that they won. I also like the concept: 18th century Versailles as a conemporary teen drama (complete with sex, drugs and rock n' roll) has some intersting parallels and if they were explored this would have been a much better film.  But why does Hollywood persist in thinking that movie goers not only are completely ignorant of history but also are completely incapable of common sense?The film argues that Marie Antoinette was naive about the political situation of France but basically good hearted. This argument is made in several scenes where we see Marie taking joy in nature, being an attentive mother, and having her feelings hurt in order to evoke the viewers sympathy. Unfortunatley there's too much happening to undermine that depiction.  The film  portrays the 14 year old Marie being taken to France as a child, innocent and unused to the rivalries and dramas of court. It forgets that Marie was raised in the Austrian court and was bred on court politics and taught what was expected of her from childhood. There's no way she would have gone to France that clueless. Furthermore the film undermines the case that it was naivite that caused Marie to ignore the suffering of her subjects as opposed to insensativity or decadence by having several scenes where Marie is exposed, in some way or another to the realities of her world. At one point a letter regarding the situation on Poland is read to her as she picks out dresses. She ignores the letter and then asks the reader if her prefers her sleeves with or without ruffles. Later in the film we see her reading Rousseau and discussing The Marriage of Figaro, both of which were controversial on a literary basis because they undermined aristocratic authority. Marie has no conception of them beyond that they're pretty.  In other words we see her exposed to the politics and culture that led to the revoution but merely ignoring them in favor of champagne, shoes, and hairdos. We see in one scene she wants oak trees brought in to line a walk way. At the same time she's ordering them she's told that she's overspent seriously and that she has no money to give to her charities. Marie considers for a moment, tells her servant to ""order the small oaks"" and she'll ask her husband for the charity money. When a newspaper charges her with the ""let them eat cake"" line  she acts offended claiming ""I would never say that"". Interesting since she's been depicted as exactly the kind of person who would say that! The item thrown in with other newspaper gossip about Marie's sex life implying that she was sort of an 18th Century Paris Hilton.  Exactly. That's the problem. Either she is a rich party girl, ignorant by choice, or she's someone else that the movie doesn't portray. But if she is a rich twit why are we expected to like her?The pacing alternately brushes over important events and lingers lovingly on montages of Marie partying her life away and images of shoes and cakes. I'm very curious as to why actors like Jason Schwartzman, Judy Davis, Marianne Faithfull, Rose Byrne, and Rip Torn were hired and then given nothing to do as this is essentially the Kirsten Dunst Show.  Another mental question mark arises when I consider that fact that Kirsten Dunst has been acting since she was a small child (according to IMDb she started acting at the age of 3) and seems never to improve or display any skill. She puts on happy faces and sad faces which look remarkably similar (in this film I found it diffucult to tell if she was laughing or crying in a particular scene) but her interpretation of roles is always a variation on the same thing. She seems to say ""Isn't it fun to be beautiful and popular? Oh...wait...I'm sad!"" in Marie Antoinette as well as  roles from Bring it On to The Virgin Suicides to the Spiderman films.Maybe I'm being too harsh on this film. As I said earlier, as a film it has its strengths, which are primarily visual. But ultimately I'm left frustrated. There was a good movie in here somewhere but Sofia Coppola was either reluctant or incapable of letting it come through.",2,Pretty but paper thin,1173139200,"03 6, 2007",2007,4372,"['held', 'off', 'seeing', 'theaters', 'trailer', 'failed', 'impress', ""'d"", 'heard', 'negative', 'things', 'finally', 'seeing', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'good', 'visually', 'stunning', 'film', 'gorgeous', 'shots', 'Versailles', 'costumes', 'totally', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'won', 'also', 'concept', '18th', 'century', 'Versailles', 'conemporary', 'teen', 'drama', 'complete', 'sex', 'drugs', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'intersting', 'parallels', 'were', 'explored', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'why', 'Hollywood', 'persist', 'thinking', 'movie', 'goers', 'not', 'only', 'are', 'completely', 'ignorant', 'history', 'also', 'are', 'completely', 'incapable', 'common', 'sense', 'film', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'was', 'naive', 'political', 'situation', 'France', 'basically', 'good', 'hearted', 'argument', 'made', 'several', 'scenes', 'where', 'see', 'Marie', 'taking', 'joy', 'nature', 'being', 'attentive', 'mother', 'having', 'feelings', 'hurt', 'order', 'evoke', 'viewers', 'sympathy', 'Unfortunatley', 'too', 'much', 'happening', 'undermine', 'depiction', 'film', '14', 'year', 'old', 'Marie', 'being', 'taken', 'France', 'child', 'innocent', 'unused', 'rivalries', 'dramas', 'court', 'Marie', 'was', 'raised', 'Austrian', 'court', 'was', 'bred', 'court', 'politics', 'taught', 'what', 'was', 'expected', 'childhood', 'way', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'France', 'clueless', 'film', 'case', 'was', 'naivite', 'caused', 'Marie', 'ignore', 'suffering', 'subjects', 'opposed', 'insensativity', 'decadence', 'having', 'several', 'scenes', 'where', 'Marie', 'exposed', 'way', 'realities', 'world', 'one', 'point', 'letter', 'regarding', 'situation', 'Poland', 'read', 'out', 'dresses', 'letter', 'then', 'reader', 'prefers', 'sleeves', 'ruffles', 'Later', 'film', 'see', 'reading', 'Rousseau', 'discussing', 'Marriage', 'Figaro', 'were', 'controversial', 'literary', 'basis', 'undermined', 'aristocratic', 'authority', 'Marie', 'conception', ""'re"", 'pretty', 'other', 'words', 'see', 'exposed', 'politics', 'culture', 'led', 'revoution', 'merely', 'ignoring', 'favor', 'champagne', 'shoes', 'hairdos', 'see', 'one', 'scene', 'oak', 'trees', 'brought', 'line', 'walk', 'way', 'same', 'time', 'ordering', 'told', 'overspent', 'seriously', 'money', 'give', 'charities', 'Marie', 'considers', 'moment', 'servant', 'order', 'small', 'oaks', ""'ll"", 'ask', 'husband', 'charity', 'money', 'When', 'newspaper', 'let', 'eat', 'cake', 'line', 'offended', 'claiming', 'would', 'never', 'say', 'Interesting', 'been', 'depicted', 'exactly', 'kind', 'person', 'who', 'would', 'say', 'item', 'thrown', 'other', 'newspaper', 'gossip', 'Marie', 'sex', 'life', 'implying', 'was', 'sort', '18th', 'Century', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'Exactly', 'problem', 'rich', 'party', 'girl', 'ignorant', 'choice', 'someone', 'else', 'movie', ""n't"", 'portray', 'rich', 'twit', 'why', 'are', 'expected', 'like', 'pacing', 'alternately', 'brushes', 'important', 'events', 'lingers', 'lovingly', 'montages', 'Marie', 'partying', 'life', 'away', 'images', 'shoes', 'cakes', ""'m"", 'very', 'curious', 'why', 'actors', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'Judy', 'Davis', 'Marianne', 'Faithfull', 'Rose', 'Byrne', 'Rip', 'Torn', 'were', 'hired', 'then', 'given', 'nothing', 'do', 'essentially', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Show', 'mental', 'question', 'mark', 'when', 'consider', 'fact', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'been', 'acting', 'was', 'small', 'child', 'according', 'IMDb', 'started', 'acting', 'age', '3', 'never', 'improve', 'display', 'skill', 'happy', 'sad', 'look', 'remarkably', 'similar', 'film', 'found', 'tell', 'was', 'laughing', 'crying', 'particular', 'scene', 'interpretation', 'roles', 'always', 'variation', 'same', 'thing', 'say', ""n't"", 'fun', 'be', 'beautiful', 'popular', 'Oh', 'wait', ""'m"", 'sad', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'as', 'well', 'roles', 'Bring', 'Virgin', 'Suicides', 'Spiderman', 'films.Maybe', ""'m"", 'being', 'too', 'harsh', 'film', 'said', 'earlier', 'film', 'strengths', 'are', 'primarily', 'visual', 'ultimately', ""'m"", 'left', 'frustrated', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'here', 'somewhere', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'was', 'reluctant', 'incapable', 'letting', 'come']",Marie Antoinette

I will admit that, while I still like the fictitious novel a lot better, this movie is even more beautiful than Coppola's Virgin Suicides which a lot of people don't get either.  See, that's the great thing about art films; you can put your own interpretation on them, and that's a definite plus.Kirsten Dunst is beautiful, vulnerable, and believable as one of the most hated queens in history, and Coppola's touch with the new romantic era music is right on the mark as so many of those early 80s groups mimicked the attire worn back then.  Beautiful costumes and sets are a feast for the eyes, and the music is a real blast for anybody who loves Coppola's fresh and invigorating ideas.  You don't have to agree with those of us who like the movie, but you sure have to admit it's gorgeous to look at and the soundtrack fits Coppola's style.  If you've seen the Virgin Suicides, you will understand this movie better.

648424,APTVNT7U6RZC3,B00005JPAS,"Loves the View ""Louise""","[9, 14]","""We are too young to reign"" says Louis  XVI as he and Marie are crowned. This movie demonstrates the truth of this. Oblivious to the world around, these cool young aristocrats enjoy all that life has to offer.  The movie succedes in portrying the hedonistic extravagance of the late 18th century French court, but for the viewer, it doesn't end too soon.Clothing, servants, food, endless parties.  Revolution may be the only answer for those outside these walls who pay the bills that Louis approves.It's a relief not to hear British accents which are common in most US made historical dramas, regardless of the country portrayed. The sets and costumes are a feast for the eyes. Marianne Faithful's voice reading the Empress of Austria's letters to her daughter is worth the price of admission. But the movie doesn't work.One problem is that there isn't enough action or dialog to fill the time.  Shots of fountains, people climbing Versailles' broad staricases, shoes being removed from boxes and drinks being poured recur and recur. These last far too long.Another problem is that Dunst is not a frivolous 15 year old, and looks exactly like an adult playing a teen through a lot of movie, which makes her adult years similarly unconvincing. The experiment with contemporary music works in the masked ball in Paris scene, but is generally a distraction. It may be the fault of the script, but the acting in many scenes such as, the royals being told of the crowd outside Versailles, those with Louis XV's tart and that of Marie's girlfriends' visit to her country estate is pretty sophmoric.I wonder who this movie was made for.

When Marie mopes around the Petit Trianon thinking about her lover, it was similar to Charlotte moping around her Tokyo hotel room waiting for her boyfriend. Coppola is particularly good at chronicling a a kind of feminine loneliness and malaise. We sympathize with Charlotte and Marie even though it's easy to feel impatient with their lack of introspection and seemingly empty lives.

Wha?)On the good side, the palace is amazing, the costumes immaculate, and the details gorgeous.

One thing that really bothered me was how they don't explain why Louis and Marie did not consummate their relationship at first, so the movie just made it seem as if he was disinterested at first and then bam, one night he gets horny, so if you don't know the real story (there are several versions. One is that Louis was just very shy, since the marriage was arranged. A second is that he was afraid that his bride might attempt to manipulate him, since courtly intrigues were the norm at the French court. Another was that Louis had a medical condition that made having an erection painful, it is not until after a operation that he was able to finally consummate/enjoy sex) you wonder what is going on.The movie is just fluff, and in real life, in the 1780's, Marie Antoinette gained weight due to having children and indulging in treats, yet this is not shown in the movie so even at the end of the movie she is still slim and pretty.

Having missed it in theaters I didn't know what to expect, other then what I heard which was less then flattering. True this film must make historical film purist cringe. Everything about this movie dances on the feet of whats expected. Visually MA almost defies description. To say that is astoundingly, jaw droppingly lovely is a vast understatment. But it's more then that. Most of us have this image of Marie Antoinette dripping in dimonds, cold and sneering as her subjects starve in the streets. Coppola's vision works to deconstruct that image. We see her as the child bride of a fragile alliance, Marie's new home is a viper pit of dager sharp gossip and quiet slander. for more then seven years her husband seems utterly disinterested in consumating their marriage, and for a long time she has no real friends. is it any wonder that she filled her life with excess, perhaps to cover her emptiness and isolation.It can be said that Marie Antoinette was an uneffective ruler but perhaps because she was taught that her purpose began and ended with being sweet, pleasing and compliant,but above all to conceive male heirs. if she was week in the area of political ablity and the skills needed to rule a kingdom maybe the falt was not entirely hers. Dunst Plays MA in three distinct stages of life, young, spirited, if naive child. Loving mother, and determined women. and Finaly doomed Queen. As to the films criticism MA has much in common with Baz Luhrmann's 1996 retelling of Romeo and Juliet in terms of being excentric and over the top. And similar to R&J you'll most likely either love Marie Antoinette or hate it. As for me, I'm not in love with the film but I was very impressed with it as a whole.

648437,A3KEZLJ59C1JVH,B00005JPAS,Melissa Niksic,"[33, 36]","I enjoyed ""Marie Antoinette"" a lot more than I thought I would. The film begins with Marie (Kirsten Dunst), the Austrian Archduchess, setting off to France to marry Louis-Auguste (Jason Schwartzman). Unfortunately, Marie's new husband has little interest in her or in the act of consummating their marriage, so the future queen finds herself in limbo for quite some time, as it is uncertain whether she will produce an heir to the throne and thus survive at court. Eventually Louis-Auguste comes around, and Marie gives birth to a daughter, and later a son. In the meantime, Marie becomes known as the Queen of Excesses, spending copious amounts of money on clothing and jewels instead of bothering to become acquainted with the issues of relevance to the French people. Marie enjoys parties, sweets, and even an illicit affair, but the fun comes crashing down when the monarchy falls out of favor with the citizens of France, who angrily storm the castle in an attempt on Marie's life. Eventually the royal family is forced to flee their home and go into hiding.Obviously, the best thing about this movie is the way it looks on screen. Watching ""Marie Antoinette"" is like stepping into a high-end bakery and admiring a bunch of scrumptious, frilly wedding cakes. Everything about the film is absolutely beautiful: the costumes, the shoes, the palaces, the desserts. However, the dialogue in the first half of the movie is very choppy and sparse, so the only thing for the audience to do is admire all the visual beauty. After a while the script does manage to turn itself around, and I think the second half of the movie is much better in terms of storyline and character development. ""Marie Antoinette"" has a fabulous soundtrack that consists of mostly punk music, which is a lot of fun. Also, the cast is excellent. I was impressed with all the performances, especially Dunst's. She portrays Marie as a naive, frivolous, but not entirely unsympathetic person. I thought she did a really good job.I was surprised that the film ended so abruptly and did not take us to the end of Marie's life. I think the story could have wrapped up a lot better than it did.

Enough has already been said about the visual delights, but it is the delicate, softly woven tapestry of a story beneath that makes this movie a real gem. The music, however out of sync with the period, strangely worked, setting the appropriate mood. And make no mistake this film is all about mood. It is less a biography than a sensory exploration; a story told through the senses.One percieves the mood and atmosphere of Antoinette's world, and the slow pace of the film relfects this. It was a time and place where nothing is rushed, where it is all about grace, beauty, the pursuit of the senses. The message is there for anyone to see: Marie Antoinette was a victim of circumstance, but her life was not all about tragedy. She is not the monster of legend, nor is she particularly extraordinary. She is portrayed here as a refreshingly normal young woman, who reacts in much the same way anyone would in her situation.The principle criticism I've read about Sofia Copula's vision, is that she leaves out the hungry peasants, the crazed revolutionaries, and the Queen's date with the guillotine. Having watched this movie several times, it makes perfect sense.The majority of Antoinette's life was spent at Versailles, behind gilded gates, and far removed from the ugly side of France. The viewer is not exposed to these unpleasant aspects because the Queen herself was not exposed to them, remaining blissfully ingnorant in her sheltered dream-world (rather like suburbanites of present day, removed from the sight of inner-city squalor). Hence, much of the film takes on a dream-like quality, and ends appropriately when the real world comes crashing through those golden gates. The causes of the revolution are left unexplained because Antoinette herself did not understand them (how could she?). Her subsequent imprisionment and beheading are not covered for the same reason: to Antoinette the woman, her life was of far more significance than her death.If there is any flaw in this work of art, it is that Ms. Copula seriously over-estimated the attention span and intellect of her audience. But I am very grateful for it.A final note: I too saw the pink sneaker shot, and agree with other reviewers that it was unnecessary and gratuitous.

648439,A1TJPMB7N776WS,B00005JPAS,MICHAEL ACUNA,"[224, 267]","Booed at its Cannes premiere this year (as Anthony Lane in the ""New Yorker"" states: ""Who was in the audience, Robespierre?""), ""Marie Antoinette"" is that rare bird: a film that is beautiful on the outside (everything about the physical movie is eye-poppingly gorgeous: Costumes, Food, Pastries, Shoes {yes shoes...in fact I can't remember a film in recent memory of which almost every reviewer credits the shoes to the designer: in this case, Manolo Blahnik}) as it is on the inside: studiously, exhaustively researched, thoughtfully written and impeccably directed by Sofia Coppola who gives us a revisionist portrait of M. Antoinette that is humane, heartfelt and above all measured and compassionate. There is no doubt who is in charge of this huge production and Coppola's obvious tender touch is evident everywhere throughout this film.This ""Marie Antoinette"" is told from a Marie as a girl perspective: she is very young, she is giddy, very much impatient of the French Court and it's customs, very much into clothes and shoes yet she matures, has children, takes a lover grows wise, becomes the subject of gossip, learns to love Louis and becomes a loving and doting mother. This is a fully fleshed out role of a victim, really: a victim of politics, of circumstances beyond her control.At the center of this film is the tragic, sad and revelatory Marie of Kirsten Dunst. Dunst's Marie is the outsider, reviled by the French court (called ""L'Autrichienne"" by most...the Austrian *itch), lost and 14 when she first arrives in France, literally stripped of everything Austrian, Dunst navigates this difficult role with ease. But this is not a surface performance...not at all. Dunst digs deep and reveals all the nuances, all the insecurities, all the strengths of one of the most hated women in all of history. Dunst plays Marie from her gut and she leaves her blood as well as her tears on the celluloid. Do not be swayed or fooled by the naysayers: this is a towering performance of the first order.Coppola is getting a lot of bad press or her use of 80's music on the soundtrack (Bow Wow Wow, Gang of 4, The Cure) but she has so far in her two previous films (""The Virgin Suicides"" and ""Lost in Translation"") proven to be nothing if not a populist, a product of her environment, a lover of popular culture. In ""M.A."" the music serves the story effectively by blasting away and preventing any cobwebs from growing on what could have been a stodgy Historical drama.Though Coppola will not be beheaded for making this wonderful film, it is apparent that most people just don't get ""it.""  With all that said the fact remains: ""Marie Antoinette"" contains one of the most beautiful images ever committed to film: Marie in a carriage, having been forced out of Versailles, deep sadness in her face, clutching her children and holding Louis's hand, the camera pointed out at the grounds of Versailles, she poignantly says ""Goodbye"" to the only place she can claim as home...as the carriage takes her family to Oblivion.",5,Let Them Eat Ganache,1161475200,"10 22, 2006",2006,3019,"['Booed', 'Cannes', 'premiere', 'year', 'Anthony', 'Lane', 'New', 'Yorker', 'states', 'Who', 'was', 'audience', 'Robespierre', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'rare', 'bird', 'film', 'beautiful', 'outside', 'everything', 'physical', 'movie', 'eye-poppingly', 'gorgeous', 'Costumes', 'Food', 'Pastries', 'Shoes', 'yes', 'shoes', 'fact', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'film', 'recent', 'memory', 'almost', 'reviewer', 'shoes', 'designer', 'case', 'Manolo', 'Blahnik', 'inside', 'studiously', 'exhaustively', 'researched', 'thoughtfully', 'written', 'impeccably', 'directed', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'who', 'revisionist', 'portrait', 'M.', 'Antoinette', 'humane', 'heartfelt', 'measured', 'compassionate', 'doubt', 'who', 'charge', 'huge', 'production', 'Coppola', 'obvious', 'tender', 'touch', 'evident', 'everywhere', 'film.This', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'told', 'Marie', 'girl', 'perspective', 'very', 'young', 'giddy', 'very', 'much', 'impatient', 'French', 'Court', 'customs', 'very', 'much', 'clothes', 'shoes', 'yet', 'children', 'lover', 'wise', 'subject', 'gossip', 'love', 'Louis', 'loving', 'doting', 'mother', 'fully', 'fleshed', 'out', 'role', 'victim', 'really', 'victim', 'politics', 'circumstances', 'control.At', 'center', 'film', 'tragic', 'sad', 'revelatory', 'Marie', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Dunst', 'Marie', 'outsider', 'reviled', 'French', 'court', 'called', ""L'Autrichienne"", 'most', 'Austrian', '*itch', 'lost', '14', 'when', 'first', 'France', 'literally', 'stripped', 'everything', 'Austrian', 'Dunst', 'difficult', 'role', 'ease', 'not', 'surface', 'performance', 'not', 'Dunst', 'deep', 'nuances', 'insecurities', 'strengths', 'one', 'most', 'hated', 'women', 'history', 'Dunst', 'Marie', 'gut', 'blood', 'as', 'well', 'tears', 'celluloid', 'Do', 'not', 'be', 'swayed', 'fooled', 'naysayers', 'towering', 'performance', 'first', 'order.Coppola', 'getting', 'lot', 'bad', 'press', 'use', '80', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'Bow', 'Wow', 'Wow', 'Gang', '4', 'Cure', 'so', 'far', 'two', 'previous', 'films', 'Virgin', 'Suicides', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'proven', 'be', 'nothing', 'not', 'populist', 'product', 'environment', 'lover', 'popular', 'culture', 'M.A', 'music', 'story', 'effectively', 'blasting', 'away', 'preventing', 'cobwebs', 'growing', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'stodgy', 'Historical', 'drama.Though', 'Coppola', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'beheaded', 'making', 'wonderful', 'film', 'apparent', 'most', 'people', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'said', 'fact', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'images', 'ever', 'committed', 'film', 'Marie', 'carriage', 'having', 'been', 'forced', 'Versailles', 'deep', 'sadness', 'face', 'clutching', 'children', 'holding', 'Louis', 'hand', 'camera', 'pointed', 'out', 'grounds', 'Versailles', 'poignantly', 'Goodbye', 'only', 'place', 'can', 'claim', 'home', 'carriage', 'family', 'Oblivion']",Marie Antoinette
648440,AA0Y6M1TKHNHN,B00005JPAS,Michael Walter,"[2, 4]","Marie Antoinette hypnotizes. It's full of Rococo colors and textures; it doesn't have a single aesthetic flaw. The film's focus is not on geographical politics. Instead, it's on the naivet&eacute; of the title character, and on the process of her becoming familiar with and interpreting her role at Versailles. Director Sofia Coppola paints a dreamy portrait and pictures her subject as an elusive combination of little girl and remote saint.Its dreaminess is the film's charm and drawback. Thanks to Coppola's stream-of-consciousness narrative technique, time in the movie simply slides by. We seem to have reached a different tempo; perhaps we're traveling at light speed. The beauty of each scene is marvelously emphasized by several anachronistic songs. There's plenty of giddiness to be had here.But the drawback to all the dreaminess is that everything has the same sense of importance. Despite its effectiveness and power, that narrative surprisingly doesn't tell us much about Marie Antoinette's inner life. Her loneliness amid all the beauty, a childhood transformed by others and by herself into her iconicism: she survives these things, but why?The film posits that in being a parent she finds a Rousseauian idyll. Certainly, in the movie's parameters, it is as close as she comes to love. But the portrayal of her motherhood is a cheat, because her children never question her authority and never quarrel. They have no ambivalence, and that results in our inability to see her motherhood as little more than a momentary preoccupation. And then, idyll done with, the film moves into its concluding sense of mystic triumph. What have we learned about Marie Antoinette's heart and soul? Precious little.  The portrait is incomplete, keeping us out where, with great delicacy and perception, it might let us in.A well-chosen pattern, an anchor, a motif: these could have been put to good use, illuminating her relationships with Louis XVI (Jason Schwartzman), and with the menacing duo of Maria Teresa (Marianne Faithful) and Comtesse de Noailles (Judy Davis).But on the other hand, how much would that pattern, anchor, and motif weaken what is a great film, a great accomplishment?

648441,A3APPKALUGB2GT,B00005JPAS,Michelle888,"[2, 2]","Lavish, extravagant, ambitious.  These are probably some of the best adjectives to describe Sophia Coppola's MARIE ANTOINETTE.  Within seconds of the opening, the viewers know that this is not your usual period drama.  If the offbeat music is not hint enough, watch how Kirsten Dunst lays on a chaise having her nails done while casually licking the icing off a cake, before turning to the camera with a smug look.  One immediately thinks of the phrase Marie Antoinette was infamous for and you know that the film would be filled with many irony.Kirsten Dunst plays the title role with great aplomb capturing the innocence and naivet&eacute; of a young Marie Antoinette sent to France like a lamb to slaughter for political reason.  Completely unprepared for her new life, she finds herself lost in a labyrinth of bewildering and ludicrously high expectations where her every move is magnified by the French court, including the very much delayed consummation of her marriage to Louis XVI.  The supporting cast plays their role fabulously - a testament to Coppola's ability to draw out great performances from her actors.  Most notable of these are Rip Torn as Louis XV, who elicited some giggle when he asked about how his future daughter-in-law's breasts looked; and also Judy Davis as the Comtesse de Noailles who acted as Marie Antoinette's teacher in the proper decorum as considered by the French nobility.  I thought it was brilliantly absurd how, during the dauphine's morning ritual of getting dressed and primped, Marie Antoinette is left standing completely naked in the cold as the Comtesse explains to her that the highest ranked lady in the room gets the honor.  The dauphine is left waiting as one lady after another, each one ranking higher than the one before, enters the room and thus gets the said honor of dressing her.  This is just one of the many digs at the frivolous life that the ill-fated queen lived.  One cannot help but laugh at such moments due to their sheer absurdity.Sure enough, the film does not sustain the historical accuracy of the life of the infamous title character, but one must view this film as a fun take on Marie Antoinette's life and simply enjoy the lavishness of the production and the beautiful images presented throughout the film.  Indeed, one should think of MARIE ANTOINETTE as an artful confection of stunning imagery and lavish costume.

When things finally turned around in her marriage, I actually started to like her husband. They had a sweet relationship and it's a bummer that someone slipped between them for a short while, but I was glad when he left because then the King and Queen could be a family again. There were a lot of emotional moments in this movie and I thought Kirsten expressed Marie's feelings well through her facial expressions and her eyes. Overall I enjoyed the movie because it showed the craziness of court life and how indulgent the courtesans became, which spurred the citizens to eventually revolt.

648445,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B00005JPAS,mirasreviews,"[0, 1]","Director Sofia Coppola continues her focus on emotionally frustrated young women in her third feature film, ""Marie Antoinette"", adapted from Antonia Fraser's popular biography of the last Queen of France who met her end at the guillotine. This film will do nothing to resolve the debate over the director's talent or lack thereof, since Ms. Coppola has chosen to make a stylized, candied presentation of already controversial characters in a politically complex 18th century context that the French take pretty seriously. Its purpose is partly to rehabilitate Marie Antoinette's image in the eyes of Americans, who tend to regard her as a wastrel with contempt for the common people. Having studied this period of history while in France, I can say that the French view Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette as the least  to blame for France's economic crisis and Revolution.In 1768, to cement an alliance between Austria and France, the Empress Maria Theresa betroths her youngest daughter to the French Dauphin. The 14-year-old, trepidatious Archduchess (Kirsten Dunst) marries the shy prince (Jason Schwartzman), only slightly older than herself, and becomes Marie Antoinette, Dauphine of France. In addition to the loss of privacy and oppressive protocols of the French court, the young Dauphine is expected to produce an heir. Yet her husband, though kind and respectful, won't have sex with her. In 1774, King Louis XV dies and his son ascends the throne as Louis XVI, making Marie Antoinette Queen of France. Years of pressure to consummate her marriage finally end with the birth of a daughter. But France has huge debts, bread shortages, and revolutionaries do all they can to paint the King and Queen as villains.""Marie Antoinette"" is self-consciously eye candy. It's a baroque visual feast of crisp, vivid pastels. There is little dialogue. Marie Antoinette's life at Versailles is expressed visually through a dynamic camera that seems to float, sumptuous production design, and countless scenes of the Queen and courtiers doing nothing of importance. It's not about matters of state. This is a kind of prolonged vignette illustrating the humiliation, confinement, and extraordinary luxuries that defined Marie Antoinette's lifestyle, and how this effusive, affectionate woman coped with it all, successfully or not. The sets, costumes, and hair styles are stylizations, not intended to be entirely accurate but to convey the kid-in-a-candy-store indulgence with which Marie Antoinette consoled herself in the years before she had children.This all works well until Marie Antoinette becomes a mother at age 23. As she aged, the Queen mostly abandoned her spendthrift ways and tried to sacrifice for France to the extent that a person so isolated could. The film tries awkwardly to express this and ends up being rather muddled. Two of her children died. The tone of Marie Antoinette's life changed. The tone of the film doesn't. The inclusion of her alleged affair with Count Ferson seems incongruous. The result is that the film's second half is unclear and ineffectual. Where a broad emotional portrait of her life at Versailles allows unique insight into Marie Antoinette's youth, her later life cannot be understood without more structured and intricate storytelling.Liberties taken with details and design aside, I expect French viewers will dislike ""Marie Antoinette"" on the basis of language alone. The French language reached its height in the late 18th century, and the ability to speak cleverly and beautifully was highly prized at Court. But words in this film are simple and sparse. It has been definitely established that dialogue is not Sofia Coppola's forte. But her intention here is to shift focus away from manners and onto emotions, which may be appropriate. I think ""Marie Antoinette"" succeeds as a fresh, innovative way to understand this ill-fated Queen's emotional life up to a point. But the MTV-inspired style is less suitable as Marie Antoinette ages and she exchanges old pressures for new. 3  stars.The DVD (Sony 2007): There are 2 deleted scenes, a theatrical trailer (2  min), a theatrical teaser (1  min), and 2 featurettes. ""The Making of Marie Antoinette"" (25 min) features on-set interviews with the cast, behind-the-scenes footage, discussions of the film's themes with Sofia Coppola, and interviews with the film's creative team about production and costume design, colors, lighting, and more. In ""Cribs with Louis XVI"" (3  min) Jason Schwartzman takes us on a tour of his palace at Versailles in the style of MTV's ""Cribs"". Subtitles are available for the film in English and French.

648448,A228JH8V9Y700G,B00005JPAS,MortensOrchid,"[0, 0]","Marie Antoinette is perhaps one of the most famous women who ever lived.  Exactly how did this woman of privilage go down in history as being one of the most reviled and hated?  This movie gives some insight on a few slightly off center methods.Born into the royal family of Austria, Marie Antoinette was sent to marry the crown prince of France, the doomed Louis XVI, in a strictly political rather than a love situation.  The costuming and sets are beautiful if not completely decadent, but how could anything not be in the palace of Versailles?  Unsure of herself, plus not knowing what to do with a husband who is more interested in his hobby of key making rather than her, Marie creates a core group of friends and has fun.  She parties and has a great time.The music was panned in this, as it truly did not fit at all.  Post punk rock music for 18th centure France?  Doesn't work.  That's what turned me off, the blatant marketing tactic, even casting Maryanne Faithfull as the Queen of Austria in a bit part.Eventually, Marie finds herself under pressure to produce and heir when her in-laws start having babies and the court starts gossiping.  She does produce the much needed for heir, thinking that this will be the end of her official duties.  The rest of the movie only hints at what will be their fate.  Marie and the others at court, as it seemed, really had no idea of what was going on outside the palace doors nor across the ocean.  Instead, Louis XVI would make some bad decissions, but she would stand by him.  Perhaps not as a wife or supporting him in his political decissions, but because she was truly ignorant.The movie ends at a very curious point.  Those who know their history know what their fate would be, but the movie chose to end at a point where if one didn't know anything about history you would be guesssing.  Marie and Louis flee the palace, going off as the mobs were closing in on them.  They were saying good-bye to their lives as royalty, and looking to an uncertain future.  THE END.  I would have liked to have seen just a little bit more.

Then again...Yes, to the french, Marie Antoinette was seen as this heartless foreigner who, because of her extravagant spendings and way of life, doomed France and burned it to the ground, and that belief still stands today, that's still what's in the history books.  She is summed up with one sentence: ""Let them eat cake"", a phrase which she apparently muttered when she was told the population was starving and didn't have enough bread.So it's no surprise this movie didn't go over too well with the french critics at Cannes, since here she is depicted as a lost teenage girl thrown into a world she wasn't prepared to enter and given responsibilites no 14 year old could ever deal with, notably saving the country from famine and war.Personally, I loved this movie. But to appreciate it, you have to let go of that historical aspect, which Sofia Coppola helps with by putting history in the backseat for most of the movie.  There's some in the beginning, but the moment you fully realize that she is a historical figure in the movie is at the end.It's really more a story about growing up, trying to find your place, feeling trapped and how to deal with that, and Kirsten Dunst portrays perfectly all those feelings, and she's very reacheable, and I identified so much with her, because you don't see her as royalty, just as a lost teenager.Some might not like the movie because of its pace.  Yes, just as a warning, most of the movie is people sitting around, reading, listening to soft music, peacefully ""frolicking"" and rolling in high grass, waiting, and then comes sudden bursts of retro bubbly music that fits perfectly with the tone of the movie along with the parties and getting dressed up.Personally, I wasn't bored once, I never looked at my watch, it's a movie that if you like this sort of movie (You could possibly find similarities with ""Pride and Prejudice"" from last year), then you'll be completely captivated.The whole film is cast perfectly, and the soundtrack is just amazing, and if you got into the spirit of the movie, then the end, when you realize that she was actually a real person, and that she might not have been that heartless, just lost and too young, along with the hauntingly beautiful music (""Opus 36"" on the soundtrack), will pull at your heart strings.It's definitely a movie that made me think about Marie Antoinette, and shows a different side of the story.  But you can't regard it as a historical piece, because that's not the focus of the movie.  I also thought that it completely surpassed ""Lost In Translation"".It has become one of my favorite films, and I'll regard it as a masterpiece.

648451,AYBL30P5NXNZ4,B00005JPAS,"Mr. Stephen Kennedy ""skenn1701a""","[6, 6]","It's not perfect, but it's a much better piece of cinema than its critics would have you believe.  In fact, what is created here is a deliciously personal movie about a historical figure - made not as an epic, but as an intimate and `in-the-moment' portrayal of a teenager in over her head.It's the first key to liking this movie - it is a teen-movie.  Not for them but about one.  such, all we are seeing is how Marie Antoinette must have seen her life.  A young teenager put into a political arranged marriage as the Dauphine of France, she has to leave all behind and finds herself in an intolerable situation (an unconsummated marriage - for 7 years!) with no frame of reference.  That's the second key to liking it - it is about her removal from a sense of reality - Versaille is geographically, politically, socially and economically isolated from the reality of France, until the tragic end.  (a tragic end which the movie stops just before, incidentally).This lack of a reality touchstone sends the teenager into spirals of excess - and yet Kirsten Dunst finds new depths in portraying her as indulgent, and yet sincere.  Petulant yet patient and revelling in luxury, yet loyal regardless of cost.  The movie itself has been criticised for having discordant elements - modern (and 80's) music, hand held camera movements, brighter than bright colours - and yet this is highly effective at making this story real, and not a historical document - exactly what Sofia Coppola was trying to achieve.  One scene which exemplifies this, is the masked ball - an occasion which should in most period movies would be starchy and elegant - but here is almost like a night club or a rave with pounding soundtrack - and this is precisely the excitement and impression this occasion would have engendered in a spoilt and privileged teenager.Finally, the other ingredients (an apt turn of phrase since everything looks like candy) that complete the feel of the movie - the set design and the music.  The film was given complete access to Versaille, which makes the location vivid and real - and yet in set design the filmmakers have made these places not a museum, but a real vibrant place home to many.  And of course all the wonderful bright and pastel shades made so that `everything looks like cake' are terrific to watch.  And then the music - apart from the occasional pop song as mentioned before, the music actually evokes various moods - from the lyrical simplicity of rural France, to melancholy similar in tone to the soundtrack of Lost in Translation, through to modern beats - it's a brilliant and imaginative score.Top marks to Coppola - I preferred this even to Lost in Translation.  It certainly won't be to everyones taste and best rented than bought - but it is a uniquely personal movie deserving a viewing so you can make up your own mind.",4,It's a movie about a teenager - who happened to be Queen.,1183334400,"07 2, 2007",2007,2852,"['not', 'perfect', 'much', 'better', 'piece', 'cinema', 'critics', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'fact', 'what', 'created', 'here', 'deliciously', 'personal', 'movie', 'historical', 'figure', 'made', 'not', 'epic', 'intimate', 'in-the-moment', 'portrayal', 'teenager', 'head.It', 'first', 'key', 'liking', 'movie', 'teen-movie', 'Not', 'one', 'such', 'are', 'seeing', 'how', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'must', 'have', 'seen', 'life', 'young', 'teenager', 'put', 'political', 'arranged', 'marriage', 'Dauphine', 'France', 'leave', 'behind', 'intolerable', 'situation', 'unconsummated', 'marriage', '7', 'years', 'frame', 'reference', 'second', 'key', 'liking', 'removal', 'sense', 'reality', 'Versaille', 'geographically', 'politically', 'socially', 'economically', 'isolated', 'reality', 'France', 'tragic', 'end', 'tragic', 'end', 'movie', 'just', 'before', 'incidentally', '.This', 'lack', 'reality', 'touchstone', 'teenager', 'spirals', 'excess', 'yet', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'new', 'depths', 'portraying', 'indulgent', 'yet', 'sincere', 'Petulant', 'patient', 'revelling', 'luxury', 'yet', 'loyal', 'regardless', 'cost', 'movie', 'been', 'criticised', 'having', 'discordant', 'elements', 'modern', '80', 'music', 'hand', 'held', 'camera', 'movements', 'brighter', 'bright', 'colours', 'yet', 'highly', 'effective', 'making', 'story', 'real', 'not', 'historical', 'document', 'exactly', 'what', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'was', 'trying', 'achieve', 'One', 'scene', 'masked', 'ball', 'occasion', 'should', 'most', 'period', 'movies', 'would', 'be', 'starchy', 'elegant', 'here', 'almost', 'night', 'club', 'rave', 'pounding', 'soundtrack', 'precisely', 'excitement', 'impression', 'occasion', 'would', 'have', 'engendered', 'spoilt', 'privileged', 'teenager.Finally', 'other', 'ingredients', 'apt', 'turn', 'phrase', 'everything', 'looks', 'candy', 'complete', 'feel', 'movie', 'set', 'design', 'music', 'film', 'was', 'given', 'complete', 'access', 'Versaille', 'location', 'vivid', 'real', 'yet', 'set', 'design', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'made', 'places', 'not', 'museum', 'real', 'vibrant', 'place', 'home', 'many', 'course', 'wonderful', 'bright', 'pastel', 'shades', 'made', 'so', 'everything', 'looks', 'cake', 'are', 'terrific', 'watch', 'then', 'music', 'apart', 'occasional', 'pop', 'song', 'mentioned', 'music', 'actually', 'various', 'moods', 'lyrical', 'simplicity', 'rural', 'France', 'melancholy', 'similar', 'tone', 'soundtrack', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'modern', 'beats', 'brilliant', 'imaginative', 'score.Top', 'marks', 'Coppola', 'preferred', 'even', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'certainly', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'everyones', 'taste', 'best', 'rented', 'bought', 'uniquely', 'personal', 'movie', 'deserving', 'viewing', 'can', 'make', 'up', 'own', 'mind']",Marie Antoinette

648460,A232JQR4NBH9SX,B00005JPAS,Nikola,"[7, 8]","Marie Antoinette is one of history's most (in)famous monarchs. It's not like she did anything special for her people, considering that after her reign, France was faced with many debts to settle. However, she certainly had that je-ne-sais-quoi about her, and so does Sofia Coppola's movie. It is not a perfect movie in any way (it's not even a well-done movie), but it will surely amuse for its two hour length.Every single shot of ""Marie Antoinette"" is a pleasure to look at, beautiful and full of rich colors. However, this cannot be due to wonderful filmmaking - we're talking about Kirsten Dunst and Versailles. Dunst is gorgeous, and the role suits her perfectly. No matter how many myths have been told about the queen's vanity, and no matter how many shoes Copolla fits into a shot (there is even a pair of blue Converse All-Stars), she rises above these shallow approaches to acting, and makes Marie a vulnerable, observant woman. As for Versailles, the castle is a character of its own, and one of the most important aspects of this movie. As the curtain drops, on her way to the guillotine, Marie Antoinette looks sadly through the window of her carriage onto the wonderful Versailles scenery, the last words are ""I'm saying good-bye"", and so are we.The problems with this movie are not its stars, the direction, and not even the script. The problem is that it's preposterously egoistical. The first and the last half-hour are interesting-enough, with character development and interesting portrayal of the era. However, there is an hour in between that drags along most boringly. It is such a shame that Copolla blew her chance to make a great movie, and it would've been great. Instead, ""Marie Antoinette"" feels like a Versailles slumber party, hosted by wonderful people, rich and shallow.",3,Rich and shallow,1171843200,"02 19, 2007",2007,1802,"['Marie', 'Antoinette', 'one', 'history', 'most', 'famous', 'monarchs', 'not', 'did', 'anything', 'special', 'people', 'considering', 'reign', 'France', 'was', 'faced', 'many', 'debts', 'settle', 'However', 'certainly', 'had', 'je-ne-sais-quoi', 'so', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'movie', 'not', 'perfect', 'movie', 'way', 'not', 'even', 'well-done', 'movie', 'will', 'surely', 'amuse', 'two', 'hour', 'length.Every', 'single', 'shot', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'pleasure', 'look', 'beautiful', 'full', 'rich', 'colors', 'However', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'due', 'wonderful', 'filmmaking', ""'re"", 'talking', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Versailles', 'Dunst', 'gorgeous', 'role', 'suits', 'perfectly', 'No', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'myths', 'have', 'been', 'told', 'queen', 'vanity', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'shoes', 'Copolla', 'shot', 'even', 'pair', 'blue', 'Converse', 'All-Stars', 'shallow', 'approaches', 'acting', 'Marie', 'vulnerable', 'observant', 'woman', 'Versailles', 'castle', 'character', 'own', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'aspects', 'movie', 'curtain', 'drops', 'way', 'guillotine', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'sadly', 'window', 'carriage', 'wonderful', 'Versailles', 'scenery', 'last', 'words', 'are', ""'m"", 'saying', 'good-bye', 'so', 'are', 'we.The', 'problems', 'movie', 'are', 'not', 'stars', 'direction', 'not', 'even', 'script', 'problem', 'preposterously', 'egoistical', 'first', 'last', 'half-hour', 'are', 'interesting-enough', 'character', 'development', 'interesting', 'portrayal', 'era', 'However', 'hour', 'along', 'most', 'boringly', 'such', 'shame', 'Copolla', 'blew', 'chance', 'make', 'great', 'movie', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'great', 'Instead', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'feels', 'Versailles', 'slumber', 'party', 'hosted', 'wonderful', 'people', 'rich', 'shallow']",Marie Antoinette

'All that good scenery gone to waste', i thought.But, i was interested in it, so i looked up some videos to do with it on youtube, and saw some impressive interviews and featuretts. And i got to understand what the director was trying to do.So, with that, i decided not to judge it on its 80s music soundtrack and apparently comical movie trailor. I was now actually excited about this movie.Since i skipped it in theaters, i waited for it to come on dvd.Finally seeing it, i liked the first parts of the movie, some parts were even kinda charming and fun....not to mention all the fancy, colorfull clothing and luxurious living. Lots of champane, lots of juicy rich creme and fruit filled cakes eaten. Lots of delicate sweets and pastries...more champane. And of course parties, with all that i mentioned before.I liked how Marie Antoinette gradually learns the ropes of this ""formal"" and ""ceremonial"" and ""ritualistic"" living, early on in the movie.Her introduction into the whole ""morning rutine"" becomes kinda funny as it gets more and more ""rediculous"", and with each passing day starting with this formality, she becomes more expectant and 'ready' for the day ahead. Stuff like that was fun.The gossip and whispering amongst the people of ""rank"" is kinda funny. For instance, when someone burps at the kings table.Also, the actress who is from Saturday Night Live...just seeing her again and again through spots in the movie started to make me laugh. Not becouse of what she says, but of the fact that its her and she makes these fake forced smiles. She plays sorta a side-lines gossip...you can liken her character to one of the ugly trash talking girls in highschool.The movie has really nice sets and costumes. A really nice shot in the film is when marie is on a boat in the lake just slowly sailing by.Visualy, its like a look into the lives of the rich and privlidged. Youll see what all the 18th century rich kids do day in and day out, since they dont work for a living, theyve gotta do something to keep from boredom...so they party, smoke herb and have premartial sex.I guess times havent changed much...the only thing perhaps different from today as those smashing wigs everyone and their grandma are ""rock'n"", as it were.Well, i hope you had some fun reading this. Hope it atleast slightly entertained or helped you make a decision on whether or not you should see or buy this movie.The fun in the movie eventually stops though and marie is forced to confront the repacussions of her actions, and non-actions.If you noticed, i havent been trying to give any real details away besides visual descriptions, so incase you go and rent it or buy it, you can see scenes for yourself and maybe enjoy them.The later part of the movie actually begins to show hints of depth and content....but sadly, i felt cut short and left empty at the movies conclusion. Theres so much more to be seen. But the movie fades out and i was left feeling quite dissapointed.

Van Dyke (Director), the wonderful Norma Shearer (Marie Antoinette), the brilliant Robert Morley (Louis XVI), the talented Tyrone Power, the inimitable John Barrymore, the imposing Joseph Schildkraut, and others whose names will be forever enshrined in film history for this and other grand achievements.""Marie Antoinette"" is also the name of a film made in 2006 by the uncoordinated Sofia Coppola (Director), the ditzy Kirsten Dunst (Marie Antoinette), the ineffectual Jason Schwarzman (Louis XVI), the unfortunate Rip Torn (who must nave been duped, bribed, or blackmailed), and others who will spend much of their later careers trying to live down the fiasco.This review is of course about the latter.  I can understand why some reviewers actually like the thing.  It's a pretty puff piece, a big fluffball of empty calories - cinematic junk food.  In this case, it's not super-salty potato chips, but packing peanuts soaked the dregs of a deep-fat fryer.  It's hard to resist this sort of toothsome slop - else most of the fast-food traps would be out of business.The story of Marie Antoinette is a sad one, and in the end she suffered the fate that most members of her class richly deserved.  This story needs to be told with empathy and dignity.  In this film there is some feeble attempt at the former, but absolutely none of the latter.The banality of the script is almost iconic, leaping like a starved carnivore from clich&eacute; to clich&eacute;.  Amazingly, the script touches effectively on the point that ""Let them eat cake"" (literally, ""brioche"") may not have said by Marie Antoinette at all.  In fact the script does a fair job of avoiding historical howlers.We can at least say that the script gets the acting it deserves - as Dorothy Parker once said of Katharine Hepburn, no less - running ""the gamut of emotions from A to B"".  The most important problem with the script is where it stops.The connection of Marie Antoinette with the great French Revolution is fundamental.  In this film, the Revolution takes place with scarcely any intimation that it's brewing.  But the Revolution begins on schedule anyway, but is barely under way when the film ends.  Marie Antoinette's life in the first years of the Revolution, and her execution particularly, may as well not have happened so far as this film is concerned.  This is even more lame than (for instance) ending the story of Cinderella at the point when she arrives home after running away from the ball.  (Of course, I'll bet you that most of any modern audience will sit there gaping, saying to themselves, ""I wonder what happened to her after that"".  Such is the state of modern education.)Indubitably, the lamest part of this ""Marie Antoinette"" is the musical (if you can call it that) score.  It's not merely lame, it's tawdry and terminally stupid.  When it's not insipid musak, it's rock.  Now, rock music is incapable of any real emotional content whatsoever.  It's OK for car chases, fist fights, shoot-outs, tractor pulls, monster trucks, unbridled raunchiness, and other events of more than usual empty mindlessness.  It's totally unsuitable for any film that aspires to some degree of quality.  The quantity of this stuff is a good indicator of the depths to which the film sinks.There is a little decent music in the film, every note of it composed during the period of Marie Antoinette's life or before.  Even there, the film's penchant for cheap shots shines (if that's the word) through.  Recall the several little episodes when Marie Antoinette is awakened and dressed in the morning.  The music is Vivaldi's Concerto for Diverse Instruments.  Where have we heard that before?  Remember ""All That Jazz""?  This is the music that plays during Roy Scheider's wake-up ritual.  ""Marie Antoinette"" uses some good music to good purpose and even then it's just a cheap rip-off of another film.I suppose it can be said that ""Marie Antoinette"" has its good points.  The sets and costumes are very bright, cheery, and not inaccurate.  On the other hand, the genuine tawdriness of late 18th-Century French fashion serves admirably to set off the equally genuine tawdriness of the film.  The same may be said for the complete absence of Voltaire as a character.  After all, why bring out philosophy when you can trot out titillating assertions that Marie Antoinette was a slut.",1,"An unworthy, salacious, way-below-par effort.",1250812800,"08 21, 2009",2009,4425,"['Marie', 'Antoinette', 'name', 'film', 'made', '1938', 'great', 'W.S', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'Director', 'wonderful', 'Norma', 'Shearer', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'brilliant', 'Robert', 'Morley', 'Louis', 'XVI', 'talented', 'Tyrone', 'Power', 'inimitable', 'John', 'Barrymore', 'imposing', 'Joseph', 'Schildkraut', 'others', 'names', 'will', 'be', 'forever', 'enshrined', 'film', 'history', 'other', 'grand', 'achievements', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'also', 'name', 'film', 'made', '2006', 'uncoordinated', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'Director', 'ditzy', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'ineffectual', 'Jason', 'Schwarzman', 'Louis', 'XVI', 'unfortunate', 'Rip', 'Torn', 'who', 'must', 'nave', 'been', 'duped', 'bribed', 'blackmailed', 'others', 'who', 'will', 'spend', 'much', 'later', 'careers', 'trying', 'live', 'down', 'fiasco.This', 'review', 'course', 'latter', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'reviewers', 'actually', 'thing', 'pretty', 'puff', 'piece', 'big', 'fluffball', 'empty', 'calories', 'cinematic', 'junk', 'food', 'case', 'not', 'super-salty', 'potato', 'chips', 'packing', 'peanuts', 'soaked', 'dregs', 'deep-fat', 'fryer', 'hard', 'resist', 'sort', 'toothsome', 'slop', 'else', 'most', 'fast-food', 'traps', 'would', 'be', 'business.The', 'story', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'sad', 'one', 'end', 'suffered', 'fate', 'most', 'members', 'class', 'richly', 'deserved', 'story', 'be', 'told', 'empathy', 'dignity', 'film', 'feeble', 'attempt', 'former', 'absolutely', 'none', 'latter.The', 'banality', 'script', 'almost', 'iconic', 'leaping', 'starved', 'carnivore', 'clich', 'eacute', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Amazingly', 'script', 'effectively', 'point', 'Let', 'eat', 'cake', 'literally', 'brioche', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'said', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'fact', 'script', 'fair', 'job', 'avoiding', 'historical', 'howlers.We', 'can', 'least', 'say', 'script', 'acting', 'Dorothy', 'Parker', 'once', 'said', 'Katharine', 'Hepburn', 'less', 'running', 'gamut', 'emotions', 'B', 'most', 'important', 'problem', 'script', 'where', 'connection', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'great', 'French', 'Revolution', 'fundamental', 'film', 'Revolution', 'place', 'scarcely', 'intimation', 'brewing', 'Revolution', 'schedule', 'anyway', 'barely', 'way', 'when', 'film', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'life', 'first', 'years', 'Revolution', 'execution', 'particularly', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'have', 'happened', 'so', 'far', 'film', 'concerned', 'even', 'more', 'lame', 'instance', 'ending', 'story', 'Cinderella', 'point', 'when', 'home', 'running', 'away', 'ball', 'course', ""'ll"", 'bet', 'most', 'modern', 'audience', 'will', 'sit', 'there', 'gaping', 'saying', 'wonder', 'what', 'happened', 'Such', 'state', 'modern', 'education', 'Indubitably', 'lamest', 'part', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'musical', 'can', 'call', 'score', 'not', 'merely', 'lame', 'tawdry', 'terminally', 'stupid', 'When', 'not', 'insipid', 'musak', 'rock', 'Now', 'rock', 'music', 'incapable', 'real', 'emotional', 'content', 'whatsoever', 'OK', 'car', 'chases', 'fist', 'fights', 'shoot-outs', 'tractor', 'pulls', 'monster', 'trucks', 'unbridled', 'raunchiness', 'other', 'events', 'more', 'usual', 'empty', 'mindlessness', 'totally', 'unsuitable', 'film', 'degree', 'quality', 'quantity', 'stuff', 'good', 'indicator', 'depths', 'film', 'little', 'decent', 'music', 'film', 'note', 'composed', 'period', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'life', 'Even', 'there', 'film', 'penchant', 'cheap', 'shots', 'shines', 'word', 'Recall', 'several', 'little', 'episodes', 'when', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'awakened', 'dressed', 'morning', 'music', 'Vivaldi', 'Concerto', 'Diverse', 'Instruments', 'Where', 'have', 'heard', 'Remember', 'All', 'Jazz', 'music', 'Roy', 'Scheider', 'wake-up', 'ritual', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'good', 'music', 'good', 'purpose', 'even', 'then', 'just', 'cheap', 'rip-off', 'film.I', 'suppose', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'good', 'points', 'sets', 'costumes', 'are', 'very', 'bright', 'cheery', 'not', 'inaccurate', 'other', 'hand', 'genuine', 'tawdriness', 'late', '18th-Century', 'French', 'fashion', 'admirably', 'set', 'off', 'equally', 'genuine', 'tawdriness', 'film', 'same', 'may', 'be', 'said', 'complete', 'absence', 'Voltaire', 'character', 'why', 'bring', 'out', 'philosophy', 'when', 'can', 'trot', 'out', 'titillating', 'assertions', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'was', 'slut']",Marie Antoinette

648479,ABXBWSPM6YHAI,B00005JPAS,"Rebecca Huston ""telynor""","[39, 49]","I was very, very hesitant about seeing this film, especially after I had started hearing the buzz that it was a sort of punk rock look at history. Not exactly my sort of thing. To balance it, I also heard that it would be mostly based on Antonia Fraser's excellent biography, Marie Antoinette: The Journey, a book that I had enjoyed very much. So, I compromised and waited for the dvd release to watch it.The film opens as a fourteen year old Archduchess Antoine (Kirsten Dunst) is informed by her formidable mother, the Empress of Austria (Marianne Faithful) that she will be making a marriage alliance to none other than the Dauphin of France, Louis. It will be to the glory of both nations, and young Antoine will be able to help Austria's position in the French court, especially after she becomes Queen of France when old King Louis XV (Rip Torn) dies. Full of excitment -- not the least of which is escaping her mother's scrutiny -- Antoine leaves Vienna and her past behind to endure the rituals that will make her the future Queen.But Marie Antoinette, as she is newly christened by the French, finds out that wanting is not nearly the same as having. She must dress French, speak French, and even her dogs and ladies will be French. Her husband, Louis, is barely older than she, shy and awkward, and his only interest is in locksmithing and hunting. Soon enough, there are whispers and gossip that Antoinette is frigid, infertile, that the marriage is unconsummated, and that her own position in France is percarious at best. Louis (Jason Schwartzman) tries to be a good husband, and is clearly interested in his bride, but something is clearly wrong. The old king dies, Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette become the monarchs, but there still is not an heir and it's not until Antoinette's brother the Emperor (Danny Huston) arrives for a friendly visit does anything get resolved in that direction.In the meantime, Antoinette indulges in fashion, shopping, gambling and anything she can to soothe the disappointment of having an inept husband, and a court that still sees her as an outsider. Trapped in the rigid heirarchy and etiquette of Versailles, Antoinette struggles along, finding momentary respite from dulling routine by whooping it up with her friends Lamballe and Polignac, and when the dashing figure of Count Axel Fersen (Jamie Dornan) appears, she is more than prepared to fall in love.By now, Louis and Antoinette have managed to get things to work in bed, and they have a pretty young daughter, with two more babies to follow. This gives Antoinette some security, and to be fear of the spectre of being returned to Austria.  But trouble is arising in France, first with crop failures, and the extravagance of the Court, and the French support of the American Revolution against the English. Soon, the Queen is being whispered of as Queen Deficet and blamed for the fact there is famine.Once again we get the infamous ""Let them eat cake!"" line, along with gossip of Antoinette having lesbian lovers among her ladies. Yes, it's told for a laugh, but I would love to see a film that didn't use it.Finally, the people have had enough, the Bastille is attacked by the mob, and the mob turns on the King and Queen at Versaille. The last we see of them is riding away from the gand chateau, bound for imprisonment and eventual dates with the guillotine in Paris.And that's it. Nothing about the flight to Varennes with Fersen's help, nothing about the war that started to restore Louis and Antoinette to the throne, nothing about the Queen's bravery in captivity and her spirited defense when she was put on trial for her life. It all just simply -- ends.To say that the ending feels awkward is an understatement. All that I can figure is that the director, Sophia Coppola, was running out of time, and decided that she was bored with the project after Versailles and decided to leave the audience dangling.And now, for the music. The soundtrack is a rather interesting compliment for the film. The use of punk music, especially in the party scenes is a touch that actually worked, much to my surprise.Other plus points for the film are the art direction and costume designs, which are spot on, showing the over the top extravagance and decadence of the period, and the fact that the film is actually shot in and around Versailles -- can't beat that for a location on French monarchy! Even the food and flowers are given an artistic touch -- I don't recommend this film if you have a sweet tooth, you will be ravenous by the end.But there are problems, and a few serious ones at that. One sequence of shoe shopping -- they are Manolo Blahnik?s, by the way -- there is a glaring shot of a modern pair of sneakers. This anachronism blew the film for me, and I found it stupid and pretentious of the director. The other big problem was having the affair between Fersen and Antoinette being consummated physically -- while I'm certain that they were in love with each other, I doubt that she would have gone so far as to commit adultery, given how religious she was, and she was rather prudish.Two casting moves didn't quite feel right. Rip Torn being cast as Louis XV, aging, raddled and saddled with his mistress, du Barry, just did not do it for me as a decadent, pleasure loving, indolent king. That American ripsaw accent appearing every time he opened his mouth was annoying as hell. Jason Schwartzman as Louis XVI didn't feel too right either -- while he's able to play the part with a befuddled look, looking at any portrait of the actual king shows a portly, languid man who's more interested in the dinner table than anything else.What threw me most of all were the very modern accents and use of modern slang such as ""wow"" and ""okay."" The accents are pure modern Californian American, and the squeaky drawls and screeching from the female actors again shattered any illusion that I had that I was in the eighteenth century.Yes, I know this was Sophia Coppola's vision of Marie Antoinette. But it's a glaring, jarring and at times, annoying look that will be certainly dated in about a decade or so. The version of the Queen's life with Norma Shearer in the title role is still the best -- and still watchable decades later.The DVD has England and French language tracks and subtitles, two deleted scenes, various trailers, previews for other films, a 'making of' featurette that helps to explain some of the odd turns that this film made, and a very silly short that has Jason Schwartzman as Louis XVI acting like a modern MTV star showing the viewer around Versailles in a send up of 'Louis XVI's Crib.' Very funny to watch, but it also catches the atmosphere of the film. While it's not done deadly serious, the fluff factor overall is at times overwhelming and a bit off-putting.Overall, this gets only a three star rating, and I wouldn't recommend it save as a curiosity. Go elsewhere for a more complete view of the Queen.Somewhat recommended.",3,A sherbet coloured fairyland,1173916800,"03 15, 2007",2007,6970,"['was', 'very', 'very', 'hesitant', 'seeing', 'film',

648482,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B00005JPAS,RMurray847,"[2, 6]","Other than a sincere performance from Kirsten Dunst, and a charming, but anachronistic one from Jason Schwarzman, there is no reason to see this film.It follows the story of the young Austrian princess Marie who is sent to marry the crown prince of France, as a way of sealing the alliance between the two nations.  She is initially shunned as backward and ignorant...and her clueless husband can't figure out how to consumate their marriage.  Eventually, she learns the political ropes a little, becomes the toast of Versailles, and turns into a party-girl.  Finally, the people of France rebel against all the taxes they are paying to cover the ridiculous expenses of the royals, and Marie and her now dear husband are dragged off in disgrace and ignobility.  There, I saved you the trouble.The movie features seemingly endless long shots of Marie wandering around the grouns of Versailles in lovely costumes.  She looks mostly bored when doing this, and it began to feel like director Sophia Coppola was just so proud of being able to film at the actual Versailles that she had to keep showing it over and over and over and over and...etc.  That, or the French tourism industry paid her to do it.  I got so sick of these pace-killing scenes.  Almost as sick as I became of the party montage scenes. Watch Marie get lots of lovely desserts and look decadent with her friends eating them.  Watch her drink lots of expensive wine with her drunken friends.  Watch her drink lots of expensive wine with her drunken friends.  WAIT...DID I REPEAT MYSELF?  Just like the damn film did...useless repitition.  We get the point already!!  Marie liked to party.(I've read some speculation that this film is meant to be a commentary on modern young Americans growing up famous...or perhaps it's meant to be autobiographical on some level.  Whatever...who cares.)The movie would get one star from me for lovely sets and costumes, and for giving part (however small) to the always fantastic Judy Davis.  But it earns another half star for the quirky performance of Jason Schwarzman.  He is frustrating and oddly endearing as the truly clueless royal prince.  When he finally thaws towards Marie and grows fond of her...the movie has some life in it.  Someone for Marie to have a real, believable relationship with.And the other 1.5 stars come for Kirsten Dunst's great performance.  It feels lively, and thoughtful, and lived in.  Too bad it's wasted in the hands of a self-indulgent director.  Sophia Coppola made one interesting tone piece with LOST IN TRANSLATION...which benefited mostly from her own literate script and a knockout performance by Bill Murray.  Her other film was the messy, emotionally incoherent VIRGIN SUICIDES...in which she got another nice but wasted performance from Dunst.In MARIE ANTOINETTE, I must conclude that Coppola should stick to writing and let someone else less in love with herself do the directing.  Dunst is steller, Schwarzman charming...but the movie is mostly dull.Sorry to say, in this costume spectacular and critics' darling...the empress has no clothes.

Too bad there wasn't a farthing left for a script.Other quibbles, minor in comparison: Coppola attached a soundtrack which is half 19th Century French court music and half 1990's  electronic pop music.  The latter is WILDLY jarring.  The actors speak a combination of American, French, and French-accented English according to, apparently, their preference.

648485,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JPAS,Roland E. Zwick,"[19, 19]","Perhaps unfairly, the name Marie Antoinette has become virtually synonymous with the upper class' indifference to the sufferings of the poor.  Even all these centuries later, many people still believe that the much-maligned French queen actually uttered the words, ""Let them eat cake,"" when confronted with the news that her subjects were starving (the phrase actually comes from a play popular at the time).  Writer/director Sofia Coppola's new film, ""Marie Antoinette,"" based on the book ""Marie Antoinette: The Journey"" by Antonia Fraser, seems determined to clear her name and change that perception.In this film, Marie Antoinette is seen as a sheltered, somewhat frivolous young girl unprepared for the role history was about to thrust upon her.  The movie begins at the moment when the Archduchess of Austria, aged 14, has been promised in wedlock to France's Prince Louis XVI as part of a treaty between the two countries.  She is quickly whisked away to her new nation and new role, becoming a virtual prisoner to the proscribed rites and regulations of court life at Versailles in the late 18th Century.In a wise move artistically (if not commercially), Coppola has seen fit to bleed the film of most of its potential hyperbole and melodrama, choosing instead to concentrate on the gossipy pettiness and mind-numbing rituals of royal life at that time.  We see Marie completely stripped of any sense of personal privacy, as she endures the indignities of a virtual cast of thousands having a hand in her dressing herself in the morning and being constantly under the watchful eye of moral advisers on the lookout for any breach of etiquette or protocol deemed unbecoming of a queen.  Coppola immerses us in all the finery and opulence of the glittery setting, while the drama ever so subtly plays itself out.  Even though Marie clearly resents the restricted life she is forced to endure, she rarely whines or wallows in self-pity, choosing instead to accept her role with an uncomplaining, almost fatalistic, good grace.  Even when her husband refuses for years to consummate their marriage, she remains generally sympathetic to him and understanding of his ""problem.""There are those who will find this movie slow-moving, stultifying, and boring because it doesn't go over-the-top by focusing on major moments of crisis or by overplaying the queen's famed cruelty or self-indulgence.  She is, instead, seen as a woman neither actively engaged in the outside world nor entirely dismissive of it.  Some have objected to the fact that the filmmakers have stacked the deck in her favor by showing us so little of what life was like for the suffering populace of the nation.  But it is just that insularity that helps us to see how a woman with such an apparently good heart could have been so badly misunderstood by those in her own time and by generations that followed.  At the end, when she and her family are being carted off to certain doom by a mob thirsting for rectification and vengeance, she seems genuinely bewildered, yet also strangely heroic in her stoicism and grace.  Much of this is due to the tour de force performance by Kirsten Dunst, who never overstates the obvious but allows us to see the complex woman trapped beneath all the jewel-encrusted trappings of pampered French royalty.  Marie may not display an interest in world affairs or the arcane machinations involved in running a nation, but she is shrewd enough to know how to maneuver her way through the often absurdly arbitrary power politics of court life.The movie has garnered perhaps its greatest notoriety for employing an anachronistic rock music soundtrack (a la ""A Knight's Tale"").  For me, this worked fairly well (though I don't think it is indispensable to the film by any stretch), mainly because it brings a more contemporary sensibility to a film that might otherwise feel weighted down by period piece stuffiness.  History-obsessed purists may object to the choice, but even they may find compensation in the relatively understated and historically accurate approach the screenplay has taken towards her life as a whole.""Marie Antoinette"" is, more than anything else, a study of repression, of what happens when human beings are locked into figurative gilded cages and then are expected to go about their daily lives as if anything really mattered.

648486,A3O8YT41TDXL0B,B00005JPAS,"Rudy Palma ""The Writing Fiend""","[4, 5]","Writer/director Sophia Coppola's ""Marie Antoinette"" is a true pleasure. Featuring Kirstin Dunst as the infamous Austrian suddenly made Dauphine of France in her early teens, it is a cheeky yet delightfully offbeat retelling of her tumultuous life and times.Playing like a moving painting, the film contains spectacular costumery that rightfully earned Milena Canonero the Academy Award for Costume Design. Thankfully, it matches style with substance.Historical dramas are chiefly characterized as dull, stuffy tribulations that provide no means for riveting entertainment, but Coppola wisely sets her standards high without compromising artistic integrity. She has her actors speak without any trace of French accent, and historians have griped about the looseness with which she treats key facts of the time. Had she adhered so tightly to those details, however, ""Marie Antoinette"" would not only be less relatable for the modern movie fan, it would be less of a pleasure - certainly inappropriate for a film depicting the life of one of history's most notorious hedonists.Dunst clearly knows she is privileged to score the title role, and does not take one second of her screen time for granted. Youthful and unassuming early on the film, she is a thoroughly convincing teenager. With talented actors like Jason Schwartzman and Judy Davis to play off of, she makes the displacement and isolation Antoinette faced come alive on screen.A pawn to soothe the rift between Austria and France, she is handed over to be the wife of Louis XVI , played by Schwartzman, so that an heir to the French throne may be produced. She is greeted with mixed emotions, and when her husband proves ill-equipped to due his part to produce the heir, she incurs all the blame for not being ""willing and sweet"" toward him - after all, for a woman, what is there but making babies? She also shocks all the elite by snubbing Madame du Barry, played perfectly by Asia Argento, mistress of King Louis XV, also played to great effect by none other than Rip Torn.Few friends prove genuine to Antoinette, but those that do indulge in luxuries along with her - closetfuls of designer shoes and endless trays of champagne, strawberries and cream puffs, namely. She may be a big spender, but Coppola, who bases her film on ""Marie Antoinette: The Journey,"" a recent biography by Lady Antonia Fraser, underplays this in favor of humanizing the young sprite who, after all, found herself in a most unusual situation at an extremely young age. It should be noted that, while the film does chronicle Antoinette's downfall, it does not feature her execution, which is not necessary for Coppola's vision to be accomplished.Rip Torn's small but affecting role as Louis XV is good enough to have won him the Oscar he has yet to achieve, and Molly Shannon is surprisingly well cast as busybody Aunt Victoire. Rose Byrne is also fantastic as Antoinette's fun-loving friend Duchess de Polignac, foreshadowing a great film career yet to be.The film sports an awesome soundtrack of modern sounds by bands like Gang of Four and The Strokes that provide context for the many themes of Antoinette's life.",5,Plays Like a Moving Painting...,1200873600,"01 21, 2008",2008,3155,"['Writer/director', 'Sophia', 'Coppola', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'true', 'pleasure', 'Featuring', 'Kirstin', 'Dunst', 'infamous', 'Austrian', 'suddenly', 'made', 'Dauphine', 'France', 'early', 'teens', 'cheeky', 'yet', 'delightfully', 'offbeat', 'retelling', 'tumultuous', 'life', 'times.Playing', 'moving', 'painting', 'film', 'spectacular', 'costumery', 'rightfully', 'earned', 'Milena', 'Canonero', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Costume', 'Design', 'Thankfully', 'style', 'substance.Historical', 'dramas', 'are', 'chiefly', 'characterized', 'dull', 'stuffy', 'tribulations', 'provide', 'means', 'riveting', 'entertainment', 'Coppola', 'wisely', 'standards', 'high', 'compromising', 'artistic', 'integrity', 'actors', 'speak', 'trace', 'French', 'accent', 'historians', 'have', 'griped', 'looseness', 'key', 'facts', 'time', 'Had', 'adhered', 'so', 'tightly', 'details', 'however', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'would', 'not', 'only', 'be', 'less', 'relatable', 'modern', 'movie', 'fan', 'would', 'be', 'less', 'pleasure', 'certainly', 'inappropriate', 'film', 'depicting', 'life', 'one', 'history', 'most', 'notorious', 'hedonists.Dunst', 'clearly', 'privileged', 'score', 'title', 'role', 'not', 'take', 'one', 'second', 'screen', 'time', 'granted', 'Youthful', 'unassuming', 'early', 'film', 'thoroughly', 'convincing', 'teenager', 'talented', 'actors', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'Judy', 'Davis', 'play', 'off', 'displacement', 'isolation', 'Antoinette', 'faced', 'come', 'alive', 'screen.A', 'pawn', 'soothe', 'rift', 'Austria', 'France', 'handed', 'be', 'wife', 'Louis', 'XVI', 'played', 'Schwartzman', 'heir', 'French', 'throne', 'may', 'be', 'produced', 'greeted', 'mixed', 'emotions', 'when', 'husband', 'ill-equipped', 'due', 'part', 'produce', 'heir', 'blame', 'not', 'being', 'willing', 'sweet', 'woman', 'what', 'there', 'making', 'babies', 'also', 'elite', 'snubbing', 'Madame', 'du', 'Barry', 'played', 'perfectly', 'Asia', 'Argento', 'mistress', 'King', 'Louis', 'XV', 'also', 'played', 'great', 'effect', 'none', 'other', 'Rip', 'Torn.Few', 'prove', 'genuine', 'Antoinette', 'do', 'indulge', 'luxuries', 'closetfuls', 'designer', 'shoes', 'endless', 'trays', 'champagne', 'strawberries', 'cream', 'puffs', 'namely', 'may', 'be', 'big', 'spender', 'Coppola', 'who', 'film', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'Journey', 'recent', 'biography', 'Lady', 'Antonia', 'Fraser', 'favor', 'humanizing', 'young', 'sprite', 'who', 'found', 'most', 'unusual', 'situation', 'extremely', 'young', 'age', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'film', 'chronicle', 'Antoinette', 'downfall', 'not', 'feature', 'execution', 'not', 'necessary', 'Coppola', 'vision', 'be', 'accomplished.Rip', 'Torn', 'small', 'affecting', 'role', 'Louis', 'XV', 'good', 'enough', 'have', 'won', 'Oscar', 'yet', 'achieve', 'Molly', 'Shannon', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'cast', 'busybody', 'Aunt', 'Victoire', 'Rose', 'Byrne', 'also', 'fantastic', 'Antoinette', 'fun-loving', 'friend', 'Duchess', 'Polignac', 'foreshadowing', 'great', 'film', 'career', 'yet', 'be.The', 'film', 'sports', 'awesome', 'soundtrack', 'modern', 'sounds', 'bands', 'Gang', 'Four', 'Strokes', 'provide', 'context', 'many', 'themes', 'Antoinette', 'life']",Marie Antoinette

So, if you miss the storyline, perhaps Borat is more your style.Coppola had to make some concessions to accuracy, (like the use of clearly American actors to play 18th century French nobility) but this does not detract enough from the film to make it anything less than good.Cinematographically, the film is a masterpiece, each scene could win an award in visual appeal alone.Copploa's use of modern music is bold.

648488,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B00005JPAS,Samuel McKewon,"[4, 7]","Imagine a movie about JFK that ignores the Cuban Missile Crisis, his assassination, every important speech he ever made and every decisive action he ever took, and instead focuses on backyard football games, quickie affairs and all the pills he chewed for his ailing back.That's writer-director Sofia Coppola's take on the famously executed French queen  in ""Marie Antoinette."" Daring and defiant, it's gorgeous and entirely superficial. It'll bore and offend casual filmgoers as a monotonous, two-hour rock video void of spiritual and historical integrity.But it's deliberately repetitive. It's deliberately vapid. Does that make it more essential art?Some critics have argued just that, as Coppola's aim is to dissect the modern consumptive culture through the eyes of a queen who ruled France before she was 18, spent lavishly at her Versailles palace, and became the best-known victim of the French Revolution. She's a girl who wanted to have fun. Off with her head for it!This Marie, played friskily by Kirsten Dunst, is more or less a clothes and jewelry hound who knows nothing of that impending doom. She's a party kid with a teenage husband who won`t touch her in bed. She's trapped in a royal court until she breaks away and strips off the corset for a certain Swedish count at her hideaway bungalow in the country.Is that the real Marie? I don't think so, and neither did many of the French who lustily booed the movie at Cannes upon its premiere. Coppola is aiming for a ""Portrait of a Pop Culture Artist as a Young Queen."" What she produces is a lot closer to ""My Super Sweet Sixteen at Versailles.""Coppola shoots montages of shoes, and cakes and fantastic wigs to the song ""I Want Candy."" She crafts a purposely unsophisticated screenplay that renders Marie California articulate. Her husband, king Louis XVI (Jason Schwartzman) barely speaks at all. The drama is never underlined, peripheral characters emerge and disappear, and key events are MIA.Is it crucial to depict the fallen queen's beheading? No. But The Affair of the Necklace, as it was called, represented a crucial shift in Marie's popularity with her people. It goes unmentioned. And the tragic part of Marie's story - her imprisonment after the fall of Versailles - is entirely absent.In its place? Parties, drinking, sex, shopping, wide shots of the Versailles grounds, a segment in the country where Marie writhes around in the grass, more parties, drinking and gambling.Director of photography Lance Acord, does a terrific job creating lush, moody visuals. And Dunst does her best to act the icon her director wishes her to be.It's Coppola, coming off the terrific ""Lost In Translation,"" who's not up to it. Where is her ambition? ""Marie Antoinette"" unfolds as if she's afraid to take the woman head on in the epic her life deserves.  Instead of grandeur and scope, Coppola bangs around the halls of Versailles, puts on a shiny dress and calls it cute.It smacks of fear. A modern art critic might argue ""Marie Antoinette"" is subverting the rules or channeling a fresh perspective. But historical rules and perspective are occasionally useful because they generally point toward the truth. This movie points to ""Laguna Beach.""",2,History meets MTV's Laguna Beach,1161388800,"10 21, 2006",2006,3208,"['Imagine', 'movie', 'JFK', 'Cuban', 'Missile', 'Crisis', 'assassination', 'important', 'speech', 'ever', 'made', 'decisive', 'action', 'ever', 'took', 'instead', 'focuses', 'backyard', 'football', 'games', 'quickie', 'affairs', 'pills', 'chewed', 'ailing', 'writer-director', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'take', 'famously', 'executed', 'French', 'queen', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'Daring', 'defiant', 'gorgeous', 'entirely', 'superficial', ""'ll"", 'bore', 'offend', 'casual', 'filmgoers', 'monotonous', 'two-hour', 'rock', 'video', 'void', 'spiritual', 'historical', 'integrity.But', 'deliberately', 'repetitive', 'deliberately', 'vapid', 'make', 'more', 'essential', 'art', 'critics', 'have', 'argued', 'just', 'that', 'Coppola', 'aim', 'dissect', 'modern', 'consumptive', 'culture', 'eyes', 'queen', 'who', 'ruled', 'France', 'was', '18', 'spent', 'lavishly', 'Versailles', 'palace', 'became', 'best-known', 'victim', 'French', 'Revolution', 'girl', 'who', 'wanted', 'have', 'fun', 'head', 'Marie', 'played', 'friskily', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'more', 'less', 'clothes', 'jewelry', 'hound', 'who', 'nothing', 'impending', 'doom', 'party', 'kid', 'teenage', 'husband', 'who', 'won', 't', 'touch', 'bed', 'trapped', 'royal', 'court', 'away', 'corset', 'certain', 'Swedish', 'count', 'hideaway', 'bungalow', 'country.Is', 'real', 'Marie', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'neither', 'did', 'many', 'French', 'who', 'lustily', 'booed', 'movie', 'Cannes', 'premiere', 'Coppola', 'aiming', 'Portrait', 'Pop', 'Culture', 'Artist', 'Young', 'Queen', 'What', 'lot', 'closer', 'Super', 'Sweet', 'Sixteen', 'Versailles', 'Coppola', 'shoots', 'montages', 'shoes', 'cakes', 'fantastic', 'wigs', 'song', 'Want', 'Candy', 'purposely', 'unsophisticated', 'screenplay', 'renders', 'Marie', 'California', 'articulate', 'husband', 'king', 'Louis', 'XVI', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'barely', 'drama', 'never', 'underlined', 'peripheral', 'characters', 'emerge', 'disappear', 'key', 'events', 'are', 'MIA.Is', 'crucial', 'depict', 'fallen', 'queen', 'beheading', 'No', 'Affair', 'Necklace', 'was', 'called', 'represented', 'crucial', 'shift', 'Marie', 'popularity', 'people', 'unmentioned', 'tragic', 'part', 'Marie', 'story', 'imprisonment', 'fall', 'Versailles', 'entirely', 'absent.In', 'place', 'Parties', 'drinking', 'sex', 'shopping', 'wide', 'shots', 'Versailles', 'grounds', 'segment', 'country', 'where', 'Marie', 'around', 'grass', 'more', 'parties', 'drinking', 'gambling.Director', 'photography', 'Lance', 'Acord', 'terrific', 'job', 'creating', 'lush', 'moody', 'visuals', 'Dunst', 'best', 'act', 'icon', 'director', 'be.It', 'Coppola', 'coming', 'off', 'terrific', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'who', 'not', 'up', 'Where', 'ambition', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'afraid', 'take', 'woman', 'head', 'epic', 'life', 'deserves', 'Instead', 'grandeur', 'scope', 'Coppola', 'halls', 'Versailles', 'shiny', 'dress', 'smacks', 'fear', 'modern', 'art', 'critic', 'might', 'argue', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'subverting', 'rules', 'channeling', 'fresh', 'perspective', 'historical', 'rules', 'perspective', 'are', 'occasionally', 'useful', 'generally', 'point', 'truth', 'movie', 'Laguna', 'Beach']",Marie Antoinette
648489,ANA2PVMARGY8H,B00005JPAS,"Sarah ""Bookworm/cat person""","[4, 5]","I read Antonia Fraser's biography because I wanted to read the book that had inspired the movie.  The beauty and opulence of Versailles are captured on film for all to see (with actor Jason Schwartzman giving us an MTVish tour of Louis XVI's ""crib"" in the special features).  The interior design and costume crew deserve Oscar considerations as does Kirsten Dunst's ""pitch perfect"" (Roger Ebert) performance.I'm glad that at long last Marie Antoinette can be acquitted of two centuries of slander and libel.  She at long last receives her ""day in court"" through Sofia Coppola's movie and Antonia Fraser's book, though I feel the book does a better job of portraying Marie Antoinette sympathetically. The point of Fraser's book wasn't that Marie Antoinette ""defied both royalty and commoner by living like a rock star, which served only to seal her fate"" (the movie's description of the ""isolated"" queen).  At least, I don't think that that was the point of the biography.  Yes, Marie Antoinette partied hard and lived it up for awhile, but that died down when she became a mother.  The whole movie seems to focus on this stage of Marie Antoinette's life, as though she remained in this constant phase of party girl and extravagance until her arrest.  The book helps us to decipher fact from fiction about this enigmatic woman.  And this irresponsible party mode is more myth than reality in terms of describing the bulk of Marie Antoinette's adult life, especially after motherhood.The anachronistic music didn't bother me--I understand Sofia Coppola's desire to make history seem modern and relevant.  The music really helps us see Marie Antoinette as a teenager, with an 18th-century teen angst twist that would make John Hughes proud.You never really get a sense of the passage of time in this movie.  Perhaps this was Sofia Coppola's intent as she wanted this to be an ""impressionistic rendering"" of life according to Marie Antoinette. Kirsten Dunst looks as young as she did when she first entered the court of Versaille at fifteen as she does when she leaves it in her mid-thirties.I think that if the Affair of the Necklace had been included in this movie, it would have added to the dialogue--which has been accused of being stagnant.  Plus, that incident is just so interesting, and this ""labyrinth"" (as Marie Antoinette called the affair) would have shown yet another misrepresented incident that had the effect of the queen losing even more ground with the public.The guy who plays Marie Antoinette's extramarital love interest is quite the hottie, and his character (the Swedish Count Fersen) is the only person whom Antonia Fraser believes actually had an affair with the queen (or at least the only affair that is somewhat substantiated and not mere rumor).All in all, this movie is visually breathtaking and does allow us to see what life must have been like for Marie Antoinette when she first arrives at Versailles.  It's hard to imagine forcing a young girl of fourteen or fifteen to leave everything she knows in order to travel to a foreign country and marry a teenage boy she has never met, all while living in a fishbowl.",4,"Visually stunning, but yes, the movie has its flaws",1182038400,"06 17, 2007",2007,3143,"['read', 'Antonia', 'Fraser', 'biography', 'wanted', 'read', 'book', 'had', 'inspired', 'movie', 'beauty', 'opulence', 'Versailles', 'are', 'captured', 'film', 'see', 'actor', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'giving', 'MTVish', 'tour', 'Louis', 'XVI', 'crib', 'special', 'features', 'interior', 'design', 'costume', 'crew', 'deserve', 'Oscar', 'considerations', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'performance.I', ""'m"", 'glad', 'long', 'last', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'can', 'be', 'acquitted', 'two', 'centuries', 'slander', 'libel', 'long', 'last', 'day', 'court', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'movie', 'Antonia', 'Fraser', 'book', 'feel', 'book', 'better', 'job', 'portraying', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'sympathetically', 'point', 'Fraser', 'book', 'was', ""n't"", 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'defied', 'royalty', 'commoner', 'living', 'rock', 'star', 'served', 'only', 'seal', 'fate', 'movie', 'description', 'isolated', 'queen', 'least', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'point', 'biography', 'Yes', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'partied', 'hard', 'lived', 'up', 'awhile', 'died', 'down', 'when', 'became', 'mother', 'whole', 'movie', 'focus', 'stage', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'life', 'remained', 'constant', 'phase', 'party', 'girl', 'extravagance', 'arrest', 'book', 'decipher', 'fact', 'fiction', 'enigmatic', 'woman', 'irresponsible', 'party', 'mode', 'more', 'myth', 'reality', 'terms', 'describing', 'bulk', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'adult', 'life', 'especially', 'motherhood.The', 'anachronistic', 'music', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'understand', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'desire', 'make', 'history', 'seem', 'modern', 'relevant', 'music', 'really', 'see', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'teenager', '18th-century', 'teen', 'angst', 'twist', 'would', 'make', 'John', 'Hughes', 'proud.You', 'never', 'really', 'get', 'sense', 'passage', 'time', 'movie', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'intent', 'wanted', 'be', 'impressionistic', 'rendering', 'life', 'according', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'as', 'young', 'did', 'when', 'first', 'entered', 'court', 'Versaille', 'fifteen', 'when', 'mid-thirties.I', 'think', 'Affair', 'Necklace', 'had', 'been', 'included', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'added', 'dialogue', 'been', 'accused', 'being', 'stagnant', 'incident', 'just', 'so', 'interesting', 'labyrinth', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'called', 'affair', 'would', 'have', 'shown', 'yet', 'misrepresented', 'incident', 'had', 'effect', 'queen', 'losing', 'even', 'more', 'ground', 'public.The', 'guy', 'who', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'extramarital', 'love', 'interest', 'quite', 'hottie', 'character', 'Swedish', 'Count', 'Fersen', 'only', 'person', 'whom', 'Antonia', 'Fraser', 'actually', 'had', 'affair', 'queen', 'least', 'only', 'affair', 'somewhat', 'substantiated', 'not', 'mere', 'rumor', '.All', 'movie', 'visually', 'breathtaking', 'allow', 'see', 'what', 'life', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'when', 'first', 'Versailles', 'hard', 'imagine', 'forcing', 'young', 'girl', 'fourteen', 'fifteen', 'leave', 'everything', 'order', 'travel', 'foreign', 'country', 'marry', 'teenage', 'boy', 'never', 'met', 'living', 'fishbowl']",Marie Antoinette

If you're into horses you'll have a full plate with the big black magnificent Friesians pulling the royal carriages to the gorgeous white Lippizans and the big grey Lusitano stallion that Louis 16 rides on hunts.

It was as if she was just saying the line; no emotion tied to it whatsoever.You CAN be a shallow twit interested only in parties and spending the country broke, but still there's a personality in that person. And there was definitely more person inside Antoinette than Dunst could develop, flesh and blood. Dunst portrayed her about as thick and fleshy as onion skin paper.Everyone around Dunst was acting their little brains out. Especially Judy Davis who pretty much devoured the scenery with her over-acting. One would expect that huge red slash of a mouth to be full of wallpaper and curtains! I don't know if Dunst was following directions to be completly passive and shallow, or the fact that she just plain can't ACT! And I agree Rip Torn is basically a cliche horny old goat anymore. I did love the casting of Madam DuBarry. I can see why the guys loved her. She had spunk and spirit. She stole the movie. I got so interested in her, I'm looking for biographies on her. Jason Schwartzman basically looked too darkly Jewish to play a part where all the participants looked very Nordic. He was very good at portraying Louis 16 as a mentally arrested adolescent/man.Call me morbid but I wish they had had the budget to go all the way to the guillotine. Not sure Dunst could pull off acting like she was about to die.

648492,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B00005JPAS,Scott Schiefelbein,"[2, 3]","Sophia Coppola's ""Marie Antoinette,"" starring Kirsten Dunst, is a big old piece of cheesecake . . . it looks and tastes delicious, but eating of it too heartily will only make you sleepy and obese.  There is little or nothing of resonance in ""MA,"" beyond some spectacular costume and set design.""MA"" begins with our ""heroine"" as an innocent Austrian teenager, whisked away by geopolitics into a marriage with the Dauphin of France (Jason Schwartzman).  And so begins Ms. Coppola's ""poor little rich girl"" story, where she tries valiantly to redeem Ms. Antoinette and make her an object of sympathy and admiration.  Ultimately, that's a dog that just won't hunt.We see early scenes where the spoiled rich nobility - empty suits and dresses all - smirk behind their gloves at the uncouth Austrian princess while also imposing the most ridiculous set of rules and protocols upon her.  Judy Davis exemplifies the silliness of the French court as she sternly instructs Marie to leave her beloved dog at the Austrian border - you can have as many French dogs as you like, my dear!  All these scenes pummel us into acknowledging Marie as a sympathetic figure, and yet so far she is nothing more than an undefined teenager.But soon, Marie adopts the spoiled ways of her French counterparts - she shops endlessly, takes a lover (that seems to be little more than an infatuation than a soulmate), and ignores the plight of her subjects.  The fact that Marie lives in the uber-opulence of Versailles (gorgeously shot, as if it could be filmed any other way) undermines any attempt to shore up Marie's sympathetic side.  In one shocking scene, Marie is confronted with the troubles of her people - there is a horrible bread shortage.  Her response?  She makes the less-than-magnificent concession, ""Tell the jeweler to stop buying diamonds.""  Truly, a woman of the people.Much has been made of the anachronistic '80s soundtrack, and I'll add my own quibble.  The movie seems to go about it half-way.  Much of the movie comes straight out of Merchant-Ivory, with baroque music and a period feel, but occasionally a Cure tune or other '80s punk band drops in.  Coppola could have gone all-out post-modern, like Baz Luhrmann's ""Romeo + Juliet,"" but this half-measure in unsatisfying.There are positives in this movie, but it is hard to come down on that side of the scale where the overarching purpose of the film - to redeem one of Europe's most glamorous villains - rings so false.  It is also unsettling that Schwartzman is given so little to do - his recent turn in ""Shopgirl"" shows that ""Rushmore"" was no fluke.  Dunst is beautiful, but her performance does not even match the intensity Madonna brought to Eva Peron in ""Evita.""And to top it off, after ""Lost in Translation,"" I had exceedingly high expectations for Coppola's follow-up effort.  Perhaps unfairly high, but regardless, they were not met.Check out this movie if you are a huge fan of costume and set design, but other than that, it's worth a rental, nothing more.",3,"Gorgeous yet empty tale of redemption for unredeemable ""heroine""",1183334400,"07 2, 2007",2007,3016,"['Sophia', 'Coppola', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'starring', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'big', 'old', 'piece', 'cheesecake', 'delicious', 'eating', 'too', 'heartily', 'will', 'only', 'make', 'sleepy', 'obese', 'little', 'nothing', 'resonance', 'MA', 'spectacular', 'costume', 'set', 'design', 'MA', 'heroine', 'innocent', 'Austrian', 'teenager', 'whisked', 'away', 'geopolitics', 'marriage', 'Dauphin', 'France', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'so', 'Ms.', 'Coppola', 'poor', 'little', 'rich', 'girl', 'story', 'where', 'valiantly', 'redeem', 'Ms.', 'Antoinette', 'make', 'object', 'sympathy', 'admiration', 'Ultimately', 'dog', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'hunt.We', 'see', 'early', 'scenes', 'where', 'spoiled', 'rich', 'nobility', 'empty', 'suits', 'smirk', 'gloves', 'uncouth', 'Austrian', 'princess', 'also', 'imposing', 'most', 'ridiculous', 'set', 'rules', 'protocols', 'Judy', 'Davis', 'silliness', 'French', 'court', 'sternly', 'Marie', 'leave', 'beloved', 'dog', 'Austrian', 'border', 'can', 'have', 'as', 'many', 'French', 'dogs', 'dear', 'scenes', 'pummel', 'acknowledging', 'Marie', 'sympathetic', 'figure', 'yet', 'so', 'far', 'nothing', 'more', 'undefined', 'teenager.But', 'soon', 'Marie', 'spoiled', 'ways', 'French', 'counterparts', 'endlessly', 'lover', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'infatuation', 'soulmate', 'plight', 'subjects', 'fact', 'Marie', 'uber-opulence', 'Versailles', 'gorgeously', 'shot', 'could', 'be', 'filmed', 'other', 'way', 'attempt', 'shore', 'up', 'Marie', 'sympathetic', 'side', 'one', 'shocking', 'scene', 'Marie', 'confronted', 'troubles', 'people', 'horrible', 'bread', 'shortage', 'response', 'less-than-magnificent', 'concession', 'Tell', 'jeweler', 'stop', 'buying', 'diamonds', 'Truly', 'woman', 'people.Much', 'been', 'made', 'anachronistic', 'soundtrack', ""'ll"", 'add', 'own', 'quibble', 'movie', 'go', 'half-way', 'Much', 'movie', 'straight', 'Merchant-Ivory', 'baroque', 'music', 'period', 'feel', 'occasionally', 'Cure', 'tune', 'other', ""'80s"", 'punk', 'band', 'drops', 'Coppola', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'all-out', 'post-modern', 'Baz', 'Luhrmann', 'Romeo', '+', 'Juliet', 'half-measure', 'unsatisfying.There', 'are', 'positives', 'movie', 'hard', 'come', 'down', 'side', 'scale', 'where', 'overarching', 'purpose', 'film', 'redeem', 'one', 'Europe', 'most', 'glamorous', 'villains', 'rings', 'so', 'false', 'also', 'unsettling', 'Schwartzman', 'given', 'so', 'little', 'do', 'recent', 'turn', 'Shopgirl', 'Rushmore', 'was', 'fluke', 'Dunst', 'beautiful', 'performance', 'not', 'even', 'match', 'intensity', 'Madonna', 'brought', 'Eva', 'Peron', 'Evita', 'top', 'off', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'had', 'exceedingly', 'high', 'expectations', 'Coppola', 'follow-up', 'effort', 'Perhaps', 'unfairly', 'high', 'regardless', 'were', 'not', 'met.Check', 'out', 'movie', 'are', 'huge', 'fan', 'costume', 'set', 'design', 'other', 'rental', 'nothing', 'more']",Marie Antoinette

648494,A1BEBDEHJUL5N6,B00005JPAS,"Scott Youngbauer ""Movie guy""","[3, 5]","There will probably be no other film this year that will divide its viewers more than Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette. Coppola has made this years love it or hate it film. This film divided the critics at the Cannes Film Festival and few people even booed it during the screening. Some may find this film to be overly trite but in my opinion Coppola has made a wonderful film. She has captured her historical muse with artistic style and has made a provocative film about being blinded by superficiality.Everyone who has stayed awake in world history class knows about Marie Antoinette, who has gotten the rap as one of histories biggest ditz. She was known to have said, ""Let them eat cake,"" when asked how to solve France's famine. Antoinette probably really never said it but the line has made her so iconic. Coppola's film looks at the world though the eyes of this girl and concentrates on her life from when she arrives to Versailles from Austria as a girl of 15.  She is greeted at France to a very snooty welcome and goes to become queen of France. In her title of power turns to everything her heart desired. Such as fancy shoes, ridiculous wigs, elaborate gowns and partying till the sun comes up. The script was loosely adapted from an acclaimed biography of Antoinette by Antonia Fraser.Sofia Coppola truly knows how to capture youth, particularly girlhood. She has masterly captured the dreamy side of teenage girls in The Virgin Suicides. Lost in Translation captured youthful loneliness and resulted in a spiritually moving film. Marie Antoinette feels like Coppola combined her themes of Suicides and Translation and portrays them through Antoinette. She goes for more of a sympatric approach and gives some insight of what kind of woman she was. Ultimately Coppola's general thesis of the character of Marie Antoinette is that she was misunderstood and above all just a girl who wanted to have a little fun.Kirsten Dunst stars as the title role. I personally have always found this actress to be very charming and she brings just that to the role of the pampered queen. Dunst brings warmth to Antoinette and you are able to find empathy with her.  The supporting cast includes Jason Swartzman as Louis XVI. He comically underplays Louis as being a young man way over his head. Two of the films sauciest performances come from actresses Asia Argento as Madame DuBarry and Rose Bryne as Duchesse de Polignac. These two actresses fit their roles perfectly and are a hoot to watch tear up the place.Coppola beautifully captures the theme of superficiality by using the main center piece of the film to her advantage, which is Versailles. The actual palace of Versailles was used in the film and it's superbly captured.  There are extravagant shots of the garden fountains and one particular scene in the Hall of Mirrors, which was opened exclusively for the film. Versailles is used by Coppola to be a fortress protecting its inhabitants from the outside world.Coppola films her actors in Versailles as if they were a box of candies. Everything feels somewhat sweet and stylized. Antoinette and her pose of duchesses are dressed in their finest and parade around the palace like the 18th century pop stars that they were.Coppola also does something very interesting in editing the film. She edits many sequences scored with contemporary rock music. During Antoinette's birthday party New Order's Ceremony scores the scene and the result is breathtaking from a cultural perspective by adding a little of the new to the old. The film opens with Gang of Four's song Natural's Not in It. It's in this scene introduced by the new wave rock song when the viewer gets a reminder that this isn't the average period piece.The films greatest strength is that it captures ignorance beautifully.  Marie was blinded by her own silly life that she had no clue what was going on in the world around her and resulted with her literally getting her head handed to her. Coppola takes the approach to skip over the French Revolution and chooses to show the world through the ignorance of Antoinette. What resulted when I was watching the film was that I as well was seduced by its glamour as well. The outside world didn't exist to its characters and I could see how you could easy get raped up in it. The film ends at the beginning of the climax, when Antoinette's bubble protecting her is burst by an angry mob who has stormed Versailles. Coppola chooses not to show her execution and there is really no need to see it. The climax returns to a much needed reality to the film and leaves the viewer in the same bewilderment as its main characters.",4,No other film of 2006 will divide its viewers more.,1171670400,"02 17, 2007",2007,4643,"['will', 'probably', 'be', 'other', 'film', 'year', 'will', 'divide', 'viewers', 'more', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'Coppola', 'made', 'years', 'love', 'hate', 'film', 'film', 'divided', 'critics', 'Cannes', 'Film', 'Festival', 'few', 'people', 'even', 'booed', 'screening', 'may', 'find', 'film', 'be', 'overly', 'trite', 'opinion', 'Coppola', 'made', 'wonderful', 'film', 'captured', 'historical', 'muse', 'artistic', 'style', 'made', 'provocative', 'film', 'being', 'blinded', 'superficiality.Everyone', 'who', 'stayed', 'awake', 'world', 'history', 'class', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'who', 'gotten', 'rap', 'one', 'histories', 'biggest', 'ditz', 'was', 'known', 'have', 'said', 'Let', 'eat', 'cake', 'when', 'asked', 'how', 'solve', 'France', 'famine', 'Antoinette', 'probably', 'really', 'never', 'said', 'line', 'made', 'so', 'iconic', 'Coppola', 'film', 'world', 'eyes', 'girl', 'concentrates', 'life', 'when', 'Versailles', 'Austria', 'girl', '15', 'greeted', 'France', 'very', 'snooty', 'welcome', 'become', 'queen', 'France', 'title', 'power', 'turns', 'everything', 'heart', 'desired', 'Such', 'fancy', 'shoes', 'ridiculous', 'wigs', 'elaborate', 'gowns', 'partying', 'till', 'sun', 'up', 'script', 'was', 'loosely', 'adapted', 'acclaimed', 'biography', 'Antoinette', 'Antonia', 'Fraser.Sofia', 'Coppola', 'truly', 'how', 'capture', 'youth', 'particularly', 'girlhood', 'masterly', 'captured', 'dreamy', 'side', 'teenage', 'girls', 'Virgin', 'Suicides', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'captured', 'youthful', 'loneliness', 'resulted', 'spiritually', 'moving', 'film', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'feels', 'Coppola', 'combined', 'themes', 'Suicides', 'Translation', 'Antoinette', 'more', 'sympatric', 'approach', 'insight', 'what', 'kind', 'woman', 'was', 'Ultimately', 'Coppola', 'general', 'thesis', 'character', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'was', 'misunderstood', 'just', 'girl', 'who', 'wanted', 'have', 'little', 'fun.Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'stars', 'title', 'role', 'personally', 'have', 'always', 'found', 'actress', 'be', 'very', 'charming', 'just', 'role', 'pampered', 'queen', 'Dunst', 'warmth', 'Antoinette', 'are', 'able', 'find', 'empathy', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Jason', 'Swartzman', 'Louis', 'XVI', 'comically', 'Louis', 'being', 'young', 'man', 'way', 'head', 'Two', 'films', 'sauciest', 'performances', 'come', 'actresses', 'Asia', 'Argento', 'Madame', 'DuBarry', 'Rose', 'Bryne', 'Duchesse', 'Polignac', 'two', 'actresses', 'fit', 'roles', 'perfectly', 'are', 'hoot', 'watch', 'tear', 'up', 'place.Coppola', 'beautifully', 'theme', 'superficiality', 'using', 'main', 'center', 'piece', 'film', 'advantage', 'Versailles', 'actual', 'palace', 'Versailles', 'was', 'used', 'film', 'superbly', 'captured', 'are', 'extravagant', 'shots', 'garden', 'fountains', 'one', 'particular', 'scene', 'Hall', 'Mirrors', 'was', 'opened', 'exclusively', 'film', 'Versailles', 'used', 'Coppola', 'be', 'fortress', 'protecting', 'inhabitants', 'outside', 'world.Coppola', 'films', 'actors', 'Versailles', 'were', 'box', 'candies', 'Everything', 'somewhat', 'sweet', 'stylized', 'Antoinette', 'pose', 'duchesses', 'are', 'dressed', 'finest', 'parade', 'palace', '18th', 'century', 'pop', 'stars', 'were.Coppola', 'also', 'something', 'very', 'interesting', 'editing', 'film', 'many', 'sequences', 'scored', 'contemporary', 'rock', 'music', 'Antoinette', 'birthday', 'party', 'New', 'Order', 'Ceremony', 'scene', 'result', 'breathtaking', 'cultural', 'perspective', 'adding', 'little', 'new', 'old', 'film', 'Gang', 'Four', 'song', 'Natural', 'Not', 'scene', 'introduced', 'new', 'wave', 'rock', 'song', 'when', 'viewer', 'reminder', ""n't"", 'average', 'period', 'piece.The', 'films', 'greatest', 'strength', 'ignorance', 'beautifully', 'Marie', 'was', 'blinded', 'own', 'silly', 'life', 'had', 'clue', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'world', 'resulted', 'literally', 'getting', 'head', 'handed', 'Coppola', 'approach', 'skip', 'French', 'Revolution', 'show', 'world', 'ignorance', 'Antoinette', 'What', 'resulted', 'when', 'was', 'watching', 'film', 'was', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'seduced', 'glamour', 'well', 'outside', 'world', 'did', ""n't"", 'exist', 'characters', 'could', 'see', 'how', 'could', 'easy', 'get', 'raped', 'up', 'film', 'beginning', 'climax', 'when', 'Antoinette', 'bubble', 'protecting', 'burst', 'angry', 'mob', 'who', 'stormed', 'Versailles', 'Coppola', 'not', 'show', 'execution', 'really', 'need', 'see', 'climax', 'much', 'needed', 'reality', 'film', 'viewer', 'same', 'bewilderment', 'main', 'characters']",Marie Antoinette

I can't say enough good things about it, even though I've just started writing this review.  Kirsten Dunst is amazing!  And I'm so glad I gave Coppola another chance after seeing Lost in Translation (Now, that's a boring movie)!The funky punk music gives this movie substance and an edge.  There was one song, a version of Fools Rush In, that did sound like bad Chinese karaoke.  But it was still fun.Filming was also done in the real Palace of Versailles, so it's nice to see they were able to be true to the setting.  Overall, this is just a beautiful movie filled with imagery that you can't take your eyes off of.  I found it to be liberating, thought-provoking,  and breath-taking all at the same time.Look past the simple dialogue too.

Keeping this in mind, the movie is spectacular, overboard, provokingly decadent and, at times, overtly childlike.  This is almost a study in ludicrosity if it weren't about a true historical figure. Although the historical facts do not shine the entire limelight with this adaptation of her life, the rituals of ascending then maintaining the position of royalty for a colorful young girl are.What would appeal to a girl of her age, yes - a very young girl, is exactly what appeals to Marie Antoinette. Coppola does do a masterful job from this standpoint and serves up an overloaded feast for the senses.  She also includes a fierce soundtrack (Brian Reitzell) which abounds with the indulgent 1980's tracks, a lot of Adam Ant, and including a 'youth in rebellion' theme at times.  All of these make this film get up and Move.  Sofia Copolla reinvented Marie in a whole new vision, from Princess' (at this time) young and refreshing vision.  What would have pleased and scared a fifteen year old girl/woman whom is now in charge of a country.  The ways she would have conducted herself with a man she didn't even know, but is pledged to marry.  How she seduced a nation for a while and also the sitting King. Also, how the people of France loved their new relatable Queen.Starting at the outset, the young ""Antoine"" (Kirsten Dunst) is being literally forced to make a strong alliance with her native country of Austria with the French court.  She must start by giving up everything that she loves (including her given name because it is not French) with any ties to another country, adopt a totally new French outlook, marry the upcoming King (Louis XVI - Jason Schwartzman) who is disinterested in her at first and then must 'make-nice' within the horrid rumor mill of the court.  The under breath gossip is so quiet that it screams out at Marie that is before she makes some strong friendships with the women of the court; important women.This may be where things begin to change for the worst and the Queen and King are not in favor with each other.  This happens quickly for them as a couple. The movie primarily tells the tale of the juvenile acting Princess, then Queen.  From the lush costumes, bejeweled shoes, iced and drizzling pastries in every bright hue, to the stacked-up and perfect casting, this picture is a standout for the eyes alone.  Within this setting, which is added to by the 'Queen of Versailles' herself, the teenager grows up learning several things about people.  Through a timely marriage, having children of her own and leading a country that adores, despises, then expels her; Marie Antoinette is a figure that I never took all that seriously, until this movie shed light on her from a refreshing and a very different perspective.",4,"""...The King and Queen Of France Are Complete Blunderers""",1373068800,"07 6, 2013",2013,2908,"['Sofia', 'Coppola', 'sympathetic', 'journey', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'personal', 'life', 'viewing', 'lens', 'teenage', 'Queen', 'Keeping', 'mind', 'movie', 'spectacular', 'overboard', 'provokingly', 'decadent', 'times', 'overtly', 'childlike', 'almost', 'study', 'ludicrosity', 'were', ""n't"", 'true', 'historical', 'figure', 'historical', 'facts', 'do', 'not', 'shine', 'entire', 'limelight', 'adaptation', 'life', 'rituals', 'ascending', 'then', 'maintaining', 'position', 'royalty', 'colorful', 'young', 'girl', 'are.What', 'would', 'appeal', 'girl', 'age', 'yes', 'very', 'young', 'girl', 'exactly', 'what', 'appeals', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'Coppola', 'do', 'masterful', 'job', 'standpoint', 'up', 'overloaded', 'feast', 'senses', 'also', 'fierce', 'soundtrack', 'Brian', 'Reitzell', 'indulgent', '1980', 'tracks', 'lot', 'Adam', 'Ant', 'including', ""'youth"", 'rebellion', 'theme', 'times', 'make', 'film', 'get', 'up', 'Move', 'Sofia', 'Copolla', 'reinvented', 'Marie', 'whole', 'new', 'vision', 'Princess', 'time', 'young', 'refreshing', 'vision', 'What', 'would', 'have', 'pleased', 'scared', 'fifteen', 'year', 'old', 'girl/woman', 'whom', 'now', 'charge', 'country', 'ways', 'would', 'have', 'conducted', 'man', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'pledged', 'marry', 'How', 'seduced', 'nation', 'while', 'also', 'sitting', 'King', 'Also', 'how', 'people', 'France', 'loved', 'new', 'relatable', 'Queen.Starting', 'outset', 'young', 'Antoine', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'being', 'literally', 'forced', 'make', 'strong', 'alliance', 'native', 'country', 'Austria', 'French', 'court', 'must', 'start', 'giving', 'up', 'everything', 'including', 'given', 'name', 'not', 'French', 'ties', 'country', 'adopt', 'totally', 'new', 'French', 'outlook', 'marry', 'upcoming', 'King', 'Louis', 'XVI', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'who', 'disinterested', 'first', 'then', 'must', ""'make-nice"", 'horrid', 'rumor', 'mill', 'court', 'breath', 'gossip', 'so', 'quiet', 'out', 'Marie', 'strong', 'friendships', 'women', 'court', 'important', 'women.This', 'may', 'be', 'where', 'things', 'begin', 'change', 'worst', 'Queen', 'King', 'are', 'not', 'favor', 'other', 'quickly', 'couple', 'movie', 'primarily', 'tale', 'juvenile', 'acting', 'Princess', 'then', 'Queen', 'lush', 'costumes', 'bejeweled', 'shoes', 'iced', 'drizzling', 'pastries', 'bright', 'hue', 'stacked-up', 'perfect', 'casting', 'picture', 'standout', 'eyes', 'alone', 'setting', 'added', ""'Queen"", 'Versailles', 'teenager', 'up', 'learning', 'several', 'things', 'people', 'timely', 'marriage', 'having', 'children', 'own', 'leading', 'country', 'despises', 'then', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'figure', 'never', 'took', 'seriously', 'movie', 'shed', 'light', 'refreshing', 'very', 'different', 'perspective']",Marie Antoinette

The Empress has arranged her marriage to the Dauphin of France, Louis XVI. Apparently his father is dead, because his grandfather is the king, and he has some brothers, but it's not really clear who is who.Marie has some friends at first, ladies of the court, but she dumps them for her sisters-in-law's company. Then her former friends talk about her behind her back. Part of what makes this movie so tedious is the inane dialogue. There's lots of whispered gossip, and just ordinary, boring everyday talk.Being inexperienced, even though there is lots of filthy talk at court, Louis XVI does not perform his marital duty for some years. When a sister-in-law has a baby, Marie congratulates her, then runs away to hide and bawl her eyes out. She doesn't cry because she wants a baby, she cries because if she doesn't have one, they'll kick her out - as her mother the Empress frequently reminds her. Her job is to be charming and patient with the Dauphin, no matter how fat and uncharming he may be.The king finally contracts smallpox, and they are called to his deathbed. He has no poxes visible though, and he seems hale and hearty as ever as he gives his farewell speech. His poor mistress, Madame DuBarry, has to vacate the premises.

648509,A21HJGHQBMS90A,B00005JPAS,tbr_brnd,"[1, 3]","I love history, I love France, I love French history, but I did not love this movie. There are so many bad things in this film that they just overrule the good things. It had a lot of potential, but it fell short of a great film that it could have been.I was originally interested to see how this movie would turn out but I was sadly disappointed. I understand that they said it was a ""history of emotions rather than a history of facts."" But if that was the case, why put any real history in it at all? They might as well have set it in modern LA and have a wannabe teenybopper get trampled by paparazzi.Here are some pros and cons of why I did and did not like this movie:Pros:1. The visual effects were nice.2. I loved the costumes, they were really beautiful to look at.3. Very beautiful backgrounds. It is actually filmed IN FRANCE! Not some lame set, but on location, with permission by the French government, how cool is that!4. Some good acting.5. At least they tried.6. Good looking food.Cons:1. So historically inaccurate that it was annoying. People who don't know much about this subject will be very confused.2. Not entertaining in the least bit.3. It wasn't even about a `history of emotions.' If it really was, it would have shown how depressed she got later in life, especially after her husbands death. If they wanted to show a `history of emotions,' they would have shown her wearing all black, crying, without makeup, and being on trial. THAT'S emotion.4. They didn't even mention the Diamond Necklace Affair, which was a HUGE plot point. You can't tell the story of Marie Antoinette without the story of the Diamond Necklace Affair. Look it up if you don't know what it is. But if it was in the movie there would be no point to look it up, right? You know I am.5. You don't see much about what caused the French Revolution. It's portrayed as though the citizens of France one day woke up and said ""Hum, let's start a war for no reason."" It took years to get the war started, and it's all because of Marie Antoinette and her cold and unfeeling behavior toward the people. But you don't see any of that until the very end.6. All the marchers upon Versailles were women or men posing as women. They did that because it was considered wrong to kill women, no matter what they were doing.7. No mention of Robespierre, Saint Just, Lafayette, or any other revolutionary/loyalist leader.8. Some historians say that Louis had phimosis, which is why he and Marie didn't have sex for the first few years of marriage. (By the way, when they got married, she was fourteen, he was fifteen). I have also heard other accounts saying that Louis was a homosexual, while others say Marie was a lesbian. By the way, I don't believe any of this is true.  They were children when they got married after all.9. The dialog and music did not match the time period. No one in their right mind puts 21st century American Pop rock music into an 18th century French period movie In a movie such as this you need Mozart, Bach, Handel, Beethoven, and Haydn's work, and not some modern teenybopper. Secondly, Marie Antoinette is portrayed like a Brittney Speers, Paris Hilton, Jessica Simpson, Hilary Duff, and Lindsay Lohan mixed together. I realize that she was a considered little out of control-FOR HER TIME; were talking about late 1700' to early 1800's, an absolutely totally different time period. Even Marie Antoinette would be shocked by how those *hem* act. It goes back to saying that it should have taken place in modern LA.10. The sex scene was awful.11. What's with all the horrible ways of portraying Louis XVI?  He was not the bumbling, idiotic fool that you see in the movie.  He was smart, kind, loving man of God.  He certainly was not a fool.And finally, I ask all of you who wanted to see her beheaded a question: Why? There is so much more to the story than the guillotine.

648510,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00005JPAS,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[3, 5]","I have talked about this before, but Sofia Coppola's new film ""Marie Antoinette"" prompts me to revisit the subject. When a filmmaker creates a successful film, they earn a certain amount of cache. Imagine they receive a credit card. If the film is both financially and critically successful, they earn a higher credit balance. They can then use this credit card for their next film. The amount of credit they spend on their next project would depend on the esoteric quality of the film. Then, based on the success of that film, their credit card either has a revolving balance or a fixed spending limit.Sofia Coppola had a big success on her hands with ""Lost in Translation"", her first film. It almost earned Bill Murray an Oscar, made a star of Scarlett Johannson and earned a Best Original Screenplay Oscar for Coppola. Then, she decided to make ""Maria Antoinette"". I suspect her credit balance is very low.On paper, ""Marie Antoinette"" sounds like an intriguing project. An American director shooting a film about an Icon of French History, in Versailles, with a rising American actress and a largely American and British cast. Throw in some modern music and great costumes and you have the concept behind Coppola's newest film.On the screen, ""Marie"" lacks substance. There is a ton of great production design, but that is like frosting on a cake. It looks good, and tastes good, but it doesn't provide a lot of substance.At 14, Marie (Kirsten Dunst), an Austrian princess, is sent to France to marry the Dauphin (Jason Schwartzman). Initially, she is very confused and feels isolated, but her mother pleads with her to make the best of the situation, for her home country. The King (Rip Torn) takes a liking to the young lady, but there is trouble in the marriage bed. The Dauphin is very scared of his new wife and it takes seven years for them to consummate the marriage. During this time, the gossip in the court of Versailles is rampant. Why can't she produce an heir to the throne? Is she barren? Would she prefer some strudel? Finally, a daughter is born and then, soon, a son and an heir to the throne. Then, the King dies and the Dauphin becomes King Louis XVI. And Marie, the new Queen of France, goes on a spending spree, cavorting with her friends, buying new clothes and shoes with every turn. As the French people fight for every scrap of food, the Queen's excess comes to notice and they start to protest.  There are moments in ""Marie Antoinette"" that reminded me of some of the films of the 70s. There are long sequences meant to establish a mood, rather than to depict a specific part of history. During these sequences, we see Marie running through fields with her daughter, brushing her cheek, reveling in motherhood at long last. Or she lays in a rowboat with other friends, on a lazy, sunny afternoon. Or she runs excitedly through the hallways of Versailles.This style of filmmaking is interesting and uncommon in this day and age, but it takes some getting used to. You either have to be able to figure out what the director is trying to accomplish or let your imagination run wild.The other problem is that these same sequences often resemble Nivea, perfume or female medication ads. The sun sparkling in Dunst's hair as she runs through fields of wildflowers. Marie Antoinette just has to take one pill for a problem free month.And because there are multiple scenes like this, it makes the film seem long and without substance.There are better scenes depicting the excess of life in the Court of Versailles, the gossiping among the ruling class and more, but these don't fill the story.The performances are interesting. Dunst does a good job of conveying Marie Antoinette's confusion, then boredom, then sexual attraction. But we don't really get a look inside her head. Maybe that's the point. Because she lived in such excess, and the court lived in such seclusion, maybe that is all we are supposed to see. We see her eat a lot of expensive food, try on a lot of shoes, the like. She mentions a couple of times that she would like to go to Paris, to the Opera, but the family lives at Versailles and rarely ventures outside.This is also a key point in the history of France. Because the ruling family is so isolated, it is difficult for them to understand the difficulties of their people. We get it.And from the way the film portrays her, Marie Antoinette didn't seem to care very much. But we never see what the people are doing, what their struggle is like. A couple of advisors make some vague statements, but this is the extent of the influence from the outside world.The other interesting addition is the use of modern day music. This has been done before, in ""A Knight's Tale"" and ""Moulin Rouge"", to name two memorable examples. In ""A Knight's Tale"", the music was more pervasive but never really worked, except for the use of Queen's ""We Will Rock You"". In ""Moulin Rouge"", director Baz Luhrmann fully integrated modern day music into his tale of a doomed relationship set in Paris during the early 1900s. Coppola doesn't use enough music to make it part of the fabric of the film. Because she uses so little music, it stands out all the more, making it seem odd and out of place. For this reason, her effort is more similar to the dreadful ""A Knight's Tale"" than the sublime ""Moulin Rouge"".It seems like if we are going to watch a film depicting Marie Antoinette's life, we need to learn something about her, see her in a different light, or learn about the other influences on her life. Because she and the rest of her family live in such isolation, it is difficult for us to see beyond that as well.And because we are looking for something more, and the film doesn't deliver this, our sugar high is quite brief indeed.I just wish I had been allowed to eat more cake.",3,Like A Sugar High: It Doesn't Last,1161820800,"10 26, 2006",2006,5806,"['have', 'talked', 'before', 'Sofia',

While Dunst makes the most of her limited range of emotion, she fails to give the subject matter any real depth.  Jason Schwartzmann, as Louis, shows absolutely no real emotion whatsoever.

I blame Coppola for not making the most of some talent.  There was no energy, no passion.  I didn't believe Dunst as doting mother, either.  She seemed more like a big sister to the children (who outpaced their elders in the acting arena).

648514,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JPAS,Tsuyoshi,"[23, 29]","Probably I would be one of the minority reports here, but I should be honest. I didn't mind if Marie Antoinette is played by Kirsten Dunst speaking American English because I knew Sofia Coppola's revisionist biography is not a schoolteacher's lesson about history in France. And I liked the mixture of colorful costumes and modern pop music which is unique and imaginative (thanks to the photography of Lance Accord and costume designer Milena Canonero). But to me, Sofia Coppola's ""Marie Antoinette"" turned out unexpectedly boring especially during its second half of it even though it tells a story of a person who lived a very eventful life. Retelling a familiar story is a good thing, but when the new story bores you, that would be a big trouble.I won't repeat the life story of Marie Antoinette. The new film presents her as a more vivacious, playful, or often brave and vulnerable person than is generally supposed. Casting Kirsten Dunst is a success to achieve this goal, and her portrait of the Queen of France shows undercurrent loneliness and emptiness of her life in Versailles. Colorful costumes and pop numbers like Bow Wow Wow's `I Want Candy' perfectly match her image as a young woman living the life of unreality.Sadly, as in her previous `Lost in Translation,' Sofia Coppola fails to create and develop anything original out of the great materials she is given, except good acting from some of the cast and the gorgeous mood of the place. While the film traces the life story of Marie Antoinette and her relationships with Louis XVI, Louis XV and his mistress and her affair with Count Fersen, it never sheds light on the inner side of her enigmatic character which still intrigues us. Here Louis XVI is reduced to a shy and weak youth; Madame Du Barry a disreputable woman, and Count Fersen a hunky aristocrat. All these hackneyed characterizations only help make the persona of Marie Antoinette less credible and more melodramatic.Of course Sofia Coppola has a right to show her own vision, or what she wants us to see, and sorry, but having interested in Marie Antoinette, I expected more.

648515,A2EFA8TUP4TF96,B00005JPAS,"Uhnghrid ""Grope""","[3, 3]","While this movie isn't overly dramatic, it captures an interesting feeling of awkward loneliness that seems very realistic for someone in Marie Antoinette's position. The focus is on Marie's character, and the interpretation of her as warm, young and optimistic, but made somewhat bored and isolated in the restrictive French court, is compelling. Nothing in the plot or dialogue is too obvious or overdone. The loneliness mentioned above is subtle. Marie's situation changes over time as she adjusts, and the movie resists the temptation to make her overly pathetic.The modern music is a bit too much at times, though. It should have been toned down just a little. The softer rock tracks work well, but the more intense punk songs just seem like a forced attempt to appeal to a young audience, and distract from the movie's real atmosphere.My only other complaint is the ending. It's rather anticlimactic, especially considering how much more dramatic the historical ending to this story is. It seems like they were purposely shying away from any portrayal of the real violence of the French Revolution, which is a shame since even the tiniest hint of what really happened would have made the ending feel alot more meaningful.But in general, this was an interesting and sympathetic interpretation of a historical character who doesn't have the best reputation.

It's a demonstration of what big movies should strive to provide. Everywhere you turn there's more amazing costumes, hair, and backdrops for the story to play out on.The problem is that there's hardly any story to play out. Amidst all the decadent, eye-popping design the story falls entirely flat. Actually falling would imply that it was moving and then stumbled. This story decides never to stand up. Over half of the movie is dedicated to the ""oh-so-depressing"" storyline that poor Marie can't consumate her marriage with her husband. Over and over we see Kirsten Dunst and Jason Schwartzman in bed, unable to... to what? If we're supposed to be shown how bored Dunst's Antoinette is, believe me, we've got it.The idea of the movie seems to involve exploring the self-indulgent lifestyle of the queen of France, while also painting her as a real human who's had such a ""tough"" life because her husband won't sleep with her and she had to leave her homeland of Vienna. In examining this queen, however, the entire film comes off as hopelessly self-indulgent.Marie Antoinette feels like a posh joke played on an unsuspecting audience. Although, just from the cover, you've got to be suspecting something. The cast features a mixture of British and American actors. So, some of the ""french"" characters and some of the ""austrian"" characters have American accents and some have British accents. Molly Shannon is thrown in for good measure, along with Rip Torn as the King of France. If that doesn't tip audiences off that something is wrong, what will? Jason Schwartzman, who's usually a delight to watch, is entirely miscast, unless miscasting is the idea of ALL the casting, in which case Sofia Copolla cast her film perfectly... making sure that nothing would actually make sense, and no one would actually look like they belonged.Overall, this film is a waste of $40 million, unless you want to hang your television on the wall, put this movie in, mute it, put on some good music, and host a party. Then I could see how the eye candy might be worthwhile. But as far as a story-line or anything that is comprehensible or enjoyable, look somewhere else.The extras on the DVD are mostly typical: trailers, trailer for Marie Antoinette, and a pretentious ""making of"" featurette, where we get to hear about how amazing Sofia Copolla's adaptation is (including Francis Ford Copolla, PRODUCER, saying that the more personalized Sofia made it, the better it would be). The one cool bonus on the DVD is the short ""Cribs with Louis XVI"", where Jason Schwartzman is walking through the palace in semi-character describing his crib to MTV.
