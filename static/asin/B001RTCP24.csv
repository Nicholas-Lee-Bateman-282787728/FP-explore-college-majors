E Jackson,"[1, 1]","I was totally ready to give Dark Matter a 1 or 2-star rating, but then the final 3 minutes of the movie left me speechless and took the plot in a VERY shocking direction.I can't stress enough just how crucial that ending was in saving what would have surely been a lackluster and disappointing movie.Anyway the storyline is about a Chinese boy who comes to America with his radical theories about the universe, and takes a college course where he has to deal with a professor who is either secretly jealous of his original and groundbreaking theories, or doesn't seem interested.  I was never sure just where the professor stood on the matter.  We only know he doesn't welcome the students theory.The problem?  The movie is caught between trying to tell a drama story involving the Chinese boy getting the chance to go out on a date with an American girlfriend and just becoming a regular American kid, and trying to explain his theories on the subject of dark matter in the universe.You never really care about his girlfriend because these scenes were completely undeveloped and rushed, and his opinions on the universe never really seemed thought-provoking enough to supply any alternative reasoning.  So the storyline doesn't work either way.Also, Merycl Streep was pumping out very good movies a few years ago when her popularity really elevated to greater heights, so it's surprising that during this time her lackluster and underutilized role in this movie was created.That ending though... wow what an ending!

Well scripted and well acted, it rings true.SPOILER ALERT: at the end, after being repeatedly thwarted by his major advisor/professor and his committee, he ""goes postal."" All of us who follow the news can recall similar horrific conclusions to real-life stories of academic pressure and frustration.Looking back on my own career, as a retired college professor who taught for 37 years and who spent 6 years earning my own advanced degrees, I can vouch for the general nastiness of the academic world since the late 1950s. Most academics, despite pretensions to living in an Ivory Tower, swim in a Shark Tank--and sadly many of those who succeed in that environment become the sort of shark-like person who perpetuates it. Power corrupts, whether in government, businesses, or our universities.Viewers/reviewers who were expecting any sort of upbeat ending to this film were probably not paying attention--or perhaps were imagining they were seeing an academic film that was kindred to A BEAUTIFUL MIND (2002) or GOOD WILL HUNTING (1998).Liu Xing (Ye Liu), Johanna Silver (Meryl Streep), and Jacob Reiser (Aidan Quinn) are the three main characters (stars) of this film--respectively the genius graduate student, the helpful and sympathetic culture maven, and the powerful, egotistical, self-promoting professor.Watch this at your own peril.

1233847,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B001RTCP24,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[14, 16]","DARK MATTER (2007) was quite a shock to me, not the least of which was comprised of how bad the film was as a truth-based tale. As pure cinema, it was also rather dull, silly and lackluster.The true event on which it's based, consisting of plasma physicist Dr. Gang Lu and his crimes at University of Iowa in Iowa City in 1991, speaks eloquently not only to the suspicion/racism shown toward the Chinese in America, but most loudly to the problem of graduate students and their dissertations. However relevant, all this had nothing to do with the true story.This weirdly paced, phantasmagoric rendition of the true story stars the beautiful and charismatic Liu Ye (CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER) as Liu Qing, a highly strung theoretical physics student attending some mythical college. His 'doctorate' professor, a true bastard named Jacob Reiser (a very sinister Aidan Quinn), hates the Chinese. When he accepts Liu as his student, one can see the look of a wolf in his eyes. He's going to destroy this particular student because the student is light years ahead of them all.As a run-up to the film, ""The New York Times"" ran the true story of this unfortunately unhinged student in its SCIENCE section: ""A Tale of Power and Intrigue in the Lab, Based on Real Life"" (27 March 2007). It speaks of the pressures of the Chinese college students, especially in the face of the ""one-child policy"", which places the entire burden for the family on the one child.What I saw here first and foremost was Einstein's life all over again - something similar was done to him as a college student. Though he did not kill anyone, he certainly lost his mind and it took him a year to recuperate. He wanted nothing to do with science during that year, from age 19 to 20. Einstein, had he been weaker, could easily have done what Dr. Gang Lu did.The evil Prof. Reiser (Quinn) is nothing like the professor who mentored Gang Lu in real life - but he reminded me of several teachers who had it in for Einstein, and were responsible for his ejection from school. Anyone who fails to see the horrid rat race science has become should see this film.Admittedly, with unnecessary and weird diversions from Meryl Streep (rich, Chinese-loving matron of the arts) and Eric Avari (I LOVE him - he plays the querulous old has-been professor and I see no point in his character), it's a lot to navigate.Gang Lu was one of a series of students invited to Iowa (ca. the 1980s) to study plasma physics, the first wave of Chinese students invited after China began to open itself. Many of these first students either failed miserably or ""simply disappeared"", according to ""The New York Times"". I ran into such people during my stay at college - they were trying to change America over to communism. I recall telling them they were very wrong if they thought they could do that!Oddly enough, Dr. Gang Lu, who had been awarded his doctorate in plasma physics in May of 1991, was enraged that another's thesis and not his had been chosen for a $2,500 prize. Dr. Lu apparently saw that other post-graduate doctor as ""his perceived rival"". Clearly mentally imbalanced, Dr. Lu shot all his victims in what amounts to a childish rage.What I saw in DARK MATTER was something unfortunate, if I may quote a reviewer from another film: this movie manages to be simple and complex simultaneously. It is also erroneous in its storytelling. We cannot understand Liu Qing without the small details I have revealed here. In the real event, few can say what drove Gang Lu to his terrifying and mad deed.Dr. Gang Lu killed five and paralyzed one before killing himself. He left five letters, one in Chinese and four in English, which have never been made public and it seems they never will be. All I know is I shiver when I recall that case, because it happened not far from my home. The man was a psychotic brute, who thought nothing of gunning down those who opposed him. Legend has it that when the news first broke, all his Chinese colleagues, when they heard the gunman was Chinese, said it was Gang Lu.With the way schools, science and racism remain today, it could happen again and again. See this film and take from it as much as you can. Personally, I am deeply disappointed in this art-house pretense instead of a true, dramatic 'retelling' of the tragic story of 28-year-old Dr. Gang Lu. One thing I must protest (sadly, of course) is the film had to try to protect the survivors of the real-life tragedy. If only the producers had obtained some sort of permission to render a realistic telling of that story... but they chose to do this instead. In a way it is a betrayal, because we know of no such crimes in America as this movie shows - in a way it is dishonest suggesting it is even based on a true story.Let this film, then, stand as well as it can as an object-lesson. I doubt it will do any good.",2,In the Dark,1292112000,"12 12, 2010",2010,4860,"['DARK', 'MATTER', '2007', 'was', 'quite', 'shock', 'not', 'least', 'was', 'comprised', 'how', 'bad', 'film', 'was',

Apparently 'based on true events', this story has many layers that invite discussion and reveals some facts about the American Academia that many would rather not know.Liu Xing (Ye Liu) comes from a poor family in Beijing, but rises to hopeful heights due to his exceptional scientific intelligence and is invited to a prestigious university to study with Cosmology professor Jacob Reiser (Aidan Quinn), the author of the Reiser String Theory - the entire universe is tied into a compact single ball of  cosmic wax.  Liu Xing encounters initial success not only academically but also as a fresh young student, barely able to speak English, who is taken under the wing of the kind matron of Chinese culture,  Johanna Silver (Meryl Streep).  Liu Xing develops his own theory that the universe is united by massive amounts of unseen Dark Matter.  When the student's theory conflicts with Reiser's theory, the negative results begin to affect each of the characters: Liu Xing sees his dream of earning a PhD in Cosmology and winning the Nobel Prize for his theory destroyed by the powers of academia and as he watches his fellow Chinese students succeed, he is plagued with low self esteem as he attempts to support his family in Beijing with money earned selling cosmetics door to door. The downfall of a simple genius destroyed by the inner workings of academia leads to unimaginable tragedy.Billy Shebar's screenplay tinkers with the story's credibility with a heavy dose of sentimentality at times, but director Shi-Zheng Chen keeps the story moving by allowing the audience to witness frequent glimpses of Liu Xing's humble Beijing home life.  The star of the film is the very talented Ye Liu, but Streep and Quinn carry their rather minor roles with great dignity and understatement. This is a moving story, too frequently repeated in our campuses to overlook.  There is much more to this film than first viewings reveal.

He has the help of Joanna Silver (Meryl Streep), a patron of the arts, who also admires Chinese culture.  She takes a liking to the young student and sees his potential.  Liu is interested in cosmology and is mentored by his hero, the famous cosmologist Jacob Reiser (Aidan Quinn).  Jacob is proud of his student's industrious ways and says he is brilliant to Joanna, but though he initially supports Liu, he is threatened by Liu's achievements in detecting and analyzing dark matter in the universe.We see the dark underbelly of academia and the rivalry between researchers when individuals make breakthroughs that conflict with superiors.  Unexpected obstacles appear, including politics, and understanding of what different cultures expect.Overall the film is an interesting slice of academia, research, competition, cultural issues and expectations of a rising genius who must confront the dark forces of insecure egos.",4,Academic Noir -,1277424000,"06 25, 2010",2010,1450,"['Dark', 'Matter', 'film', 'loosely', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Gang', 'Lu', 'Chinese', 'student', 'who', 'United', 'States', 'kills', 'four', 'faculty', 'members', 'one', 'student', 'University', 'Iowa', 'star', 'film', 'Liu', 'Xing', 'Liu', 'Ye', 'only', 'child', 'China', 'one', 'child', 'economy', 'parents', 'are', 'hardworking', 'striven', 'lives', 'have', 'education', 'be', 'somebody', 'Liu', 'brilliant', 'win', 'Nobel', 'Prize', 'Valley', 'State', 'University', 'best', 'transition', 'American', 'life', 'help', 'Joanna', 'Silver', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'patron', 'arts', 'who', 'also', 'Chinese', 'culture', 'liking', 'young', 'student', 'potential', 'Liu', 'interested', 'cosmology', 'mentored', 'hero', 'famous', 'cosmologist', 'Jacob', 'Reiser', 'Aidan', 'Quinn', 'Jacob', 'proud', 'student', 'industrious', 'ways', 'brilliant', 'Joanna', 'initially', 'Liu', 'threatened', 'Liu', 'achievements', 'detecting', 'analyzing', 'dark', 'matter', 'universe.We', 'see', 'dark', 'underbelly', 'academia', 'rivalry', 'researchers', 'when', 'individuals', 'make', 'breakthroughs', 'conflict', 'superiors', 'Unexpected', 'obstacles', 'appear', 'including', 'politics', 'understanding', 'what', 'different', 'cultures', 'expect.Overall', 'film', 'interesting', 'slice', 'academia', 'research', 'competition', 'cultural', 'issues', 'expectations', 'rising', 'genius', 'who', 'must', 'confront', 'dark', 'forces', 'insecure', 'egos']",Dark Matter

Meryl Streep is one of the finest actresses of our time and this is the second film she has starred in that I have found very unsatisfactory.  Although claiming to be based on a true story, it completely alters the actual events---Hollywood doesn't let truth deter ""artistic license"" if it will sell more tickets or the producers wish to present a specific viewpoint.  The film did demonstrate the severe clash between American and Chinese cultures in regard to saving face and the effects of not achieving the academic success and recognition a brilliant foreign student believed was his due.  The student wanted to make his parents proud and fabricates tales of success in his letters to his parents who have sacrificed to enable him to study in the U.S. One reviewer wrote that the young doctoral student had no way out and this lead to his final actions; he may have believed that was the case but an individual always has other options.
