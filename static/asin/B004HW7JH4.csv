1409466,A3IRBCCB3I5PPD,B004HW7JH4,"Anastasia McPherson ""Bibliophile""","[2, 2]","A lot is happening in this episode of Mad Men, all of it heartbreaking and it all makes for one of the best episodes of the season. The race to get the Jaguar account is still on and difficulties abound. The Jaguar continues to be an expensive and unreliable car and the agency hopes to compare it to a mistress, but needs the slogan - a slogan that Don is having trouble creating. One of the Jaguar executives wants Joan's company for an evening, and not as Pete puts it for dinner and dancing. It is right that Pete should define the terms as he is the weasel who pimps and pitches the propisition to Joan. The rest of the men are aghast and don't want Joan to do it but Pete is convinced that this is the only way they will get the account - even if Don comes through with his ususal brilliance. In his stress, Don is lashing out at both Peggy and Megan and Peggy is considering pursuing another opportunity. Megan is hoping she gets a part with an out of town try out.The episode highlights the differences for women and working women in particular without preaching or being heavy-handed. All of the female characters are asked to prostitute themselves in some way, either literal or metaphoric and their femininity is still their defining characteristic to the men in their world, despite what they do and how they function. Don is surprisingly moral and Pete unsurprisingly adds pander to his many slimey accomplishments. Lane is pragmatic and fond of Joan and advises that if forced to sell oneself to get the best possible price and to get it up front. Roger and Cooper are as ineffectual as ever. The editing of Don's pitch and Joan's decision about what to do is a brilliant bit of filming. The depth of Don's feelings for Peggy are finally revealed and end by being as sad as the rest of tonight's show.These characters were never paragons but tonight they all participated in the corruption that would emblematize America as it went forward into the seventies and eighties; they did it for understandable reasons and they remain good but flawed people but the worm is in the apple. A brilliant, brilliant episode that shows us why Mad Men is not only one of the best shows on television but is destined to be remembered as a classic.

Roger Sterling's complete (but witty) cad, king of the comeback.

I've just read a few negative reviews on this page and I guess it is best to assume that many people would still prefer yet another cop drama be aired instead.  Well, not me.This captures 1966 beautifully, right down to the last detail, not only in fashion but in interior decor plus the tone of the times.  One thing the ad agency has to deal with sooner rather than later is that equal employment opportunity laws just passed and their days are numbered as a white male enclave. Several scenes depict this beautifully, the best being a waiting room filled with black women applicants for a secretarial post.Don Draper remains the star of the show.  He is now married to his former secretary, Megan.  She does a sexy singing number in French at a party she throws for Don that is the highlight of the show.  To show it in 2012 is the ultimate in camp whereas in 1966 it was simply hot. The men go wild.Roger Sterling remains a wonderful semi villain.  He has moments where he is almost likable.  Then he will do something absolutely rat like which makes you hate him anew.  In this episode the issue is his office which really should belong to Peter Campbell.  The solution is pure Roger.Peggy is moving right along as the only female ad person in the agency. It is quite clear that she is becoming the main ad person Don relies on for creative ideas.  She still does not have his incredible instinct for pulling a creative idea right out of thin air which wows the client.Betty, Don's ex, is not in this episode.

But please if you're new to the show listen to this warning.you must watch this show would order to get the most out of every episode. Most television shows I feel you can skip some episodes and still derive a great quantity of joy from subsequent episodes but madmen stands apart. It is a show that I think in such a masterful way build on each previous episode. And if you miss an episode you're going to miss the reasons why certain characters act the way they do talk the way they do and do the things that they do.for example I missed season two finale the carousel and went on to season three and I was like what the heck is going on I didn't realize it until I finished all of season three and was like something was off the whole season seemed a little bit tweaked as they were building on things that I had missed ( it is of note that the carousel was the one of the most amazing season finales that a person could miss but somehow I pulled that off I can be a bonehead sometimes)For instance Roger Sterling has so much back story and is not even a real major player in the show but if you miss some episodes you missed the buildup to his character. Don Draper is a Shining example of someone that is touched upon and built upon in every episode.so that is my warning watch every episode of madmen from start to finish in order.I'm Chuck BAnd I approve of this message!PS watching madmen in high definition is a must that's why recommend only watching it that way.

Some of the Special Features on the disks contain spoilers for episodes that are on later disks. That is, if you watch the Special Features on Disk 2 (for example) before watching the episodes on Disks 3 and 4, you will see things that you might not want to know about yet. I recommend that you watch the entire season's episodes first, and then go back and watch the Special Features.2.

I know there have been a lot negative reactions towards this season, and I think maybe it's for a few reasons.  Lots of people despise Megan.  And others say that ""nothing really happened"".  I don't really like Megan either, but I've come to accept her character.  She is SUPPOSED to be annoying (or at least can easily be interpreted as so).  We don't have to like her.  As far as nothing happening, plenty of things happened, although I admit it was a little slow-paced, but I think it's building up for better seasons to come.This season takes place between Memorial Day 1966 and Spring 1967.  The season focuses on Don Draper and Megan's relationship and how distracting it is from his job, and most of the main characters are facing painful new beginnings and realize it's a ""dog-eat-dog"" world.  The season starts out light (probably because of how dark season 4 was), but by the end of the season things are gloomier than ever.  So never fear, Mad Men isn't going soft.Don - one reason I enjoyed season 4 so much is that we had a break from Don being in a dramatic, serious relationship.  He was just casually dating and we were able to see more of SCDP.  Now he's married to Megan, and that opens up a lot more storylines.  You'll either love or hate Megan.  She shows signs of being very independent and mature, but then will surprise you by suddenly doing something very stupid and childish.  The big question is: how long is it until Don cheats on her?  I don't believe that Don will be in a monogamous relationship for the rest of his life.  It's also interesting how it's reminiscent of the beginning of his relationship with Betty.  Betty was a beautiful young model and Don swept her up.  When Betty got older and he got bored, he lost interest.  Megan is also a very young girl, an actress, and pretty (in Don's eyes).  What's going to happen to his fidelity to Megan in a couple years?  Or 10?  Or even by the end of the season?  When Don loses respect for someone, a lot of feelings for them deteriorate quickly.Don also has to deal with Megan's Canadian parents, who have a very bizarre marriage and her father is not a total believer in Don.  He thinks Megan took the easy way out by marrying a rich guy.  Megan's mother is also incredibly insecure, which is a recurring theme throughout the season.Betty - since January Jones is pregnant, they decided to put her in a fat suit to hide it, and turn that into a storyline.  Perfect Betty has to deal with being overweight, which makes for some interesting television.  Her appearances are very sparse, however, and you can go episodes without seeing her at all.  There is a lot of pressure on Betty to compete with Megan, especially when her children are involved.  As far as Sally goes, she goes through a lot of childhood development this season.  Glen the creepy kid also makes a couple appearances, and their relationship is really open for interpretation.  Kiernan Shipka is also a great young actress.  We also get to see Henry Francis' mother a little bit, especially when she babysits Sally.Pete - Pete is...well, Pete.  But cockier than ever.  He feels that all is owed to him, even as only a junior partner.  He gets incredibly demanding this season and enters into some interesting affairs.  Pete is honestly one of the most difficult characters for me to empathize with, especially this season.  Almost every thing he does is just obnoxious, not to mention he is a total hypocrite.  Vincent Kartheiser is great, however.Peggy - as my favorite character, I liked what they did with her this season.  She has to balance romance and work in a very sexist society, and makes some life changing decisions several times throughout the season.  I love how strong Peggy is, and in these days she would easily be a partner already.  Peggy also is Megan's boss...which is really quite inappropriate and causes a lot of awkwardness in the office.Joan - remember that jerk she's married to?  Yeah.  They're still married when the season starts, unfortunately.  Joan is strong though, and without spoiling anything, she makes some very questionable and life altering decisions this season regarding her romantic and work life.  I think her and Peggy learn the most this season about how when it boils down to it, it's every wo/man for themselves.Lane - bitter about not getting the greatest deal out of this partnership, Lane makes some...questionable business decisions this season.  He becomes much more prevalent later in the season, and without spoiling much, he gets into a very....entertaining ""discussion"" with Pete.  I think Jared Harris is amazing for this role.Roger - talked into taking LSD with Jane, Roger has a very memorable and insightful trip.  Although the acid trip was a little stereotypical, there's nothing funnier than watching Roger doing acid.  The trip also has longer implications for him in the season.  Additionally, Roger enters into a very odd romantic relationship with an unexpected character.And it's not just the characters that will suck you in and keep you watching.  The context of show is amazingly interesting.  We get to see references to the Richard Speck murders, Charles Witman's shooting rampage, toxic clouds of smog over NYC, the Hare Krishnas, and the Rolling Stones.  Also some interesting clients this season: Heinz, Jaguar, Mohawk Airlines, American Cancer Society, Manischewitz, Dow Chemical, and Virginia Slims.You could watch this show for the amazingly intricate characters, the interesting portrayal of life in the 60s, or both.  This show is highly entertaining, addictive, and one of the best on television today.",5,"""What is wrong with you people? You're all so cynical.

1409505,APX3HA2INR9QM,B004HW7JH4,"Desiree ""Desiree""","[13, 23]","I agree with bits and pieces of all the reviews. I also wanted to like Season 5 because I love and have watched and rewatched Seasons 1 through 4, and while there were a few episodes that are some of the best Mad Men has ever done, overall I found Season 5 as a whole to be weak and thrown together.  I never felt attached or particularly interested in any of the new characters that were introduced and many of them felt more like caricatures rather than characters.  Right out of the gate I found the marital trials and tribulations of Don and Megan irritating, tiresome, and endless.  I agree wholeheartedly with the reviewer that said if episodes 1 and 2 (which were linked together) were a pilot, the show never would have gotten off the ground.  By episode 13 I didn't know how much more I could watch of Megan emoting after every single line of Don's, and wondered just how much more screen time Weiner could give Jessica Pare.  I was never bored by Betty and Don, Megan and Don just made me yawn.  At the end of each season I was almost depressed to see it end, I was so hooked and wanted it to keep going.  By the end of Season 5, it almost was a relief.  Considering that this is one of the best shows ever done, I could almost feel Matthew Weiner's boredom grinding out these scripts.  And when I read the reviews that say this is the best season ever, I wonder if we have been watching the same series.  Everyone is entitled to their opinion, and again, there were a few episodes of brilliance but not enough to make this season an emmy winner.  Also, how is it that no one remembers at the end of Season 4, Megan standing on the balcony telling Don, ""I don't want to be an actress!"" and all we have heard out of that mouth is nothing but drival about acting?  I'm going to vote with my wallet and not buy Season 5.  To me, comparing Season 5 to the previous 4 seasons is like comparing Rod Serling's Twilight Zone to his later Night Gallery.  Yes, I think Matthew Weiner is a genius but am amazed so few people are willing to say ""the emperor has no clothes"".  Even more amusing is the cover of the Season 5 dvd case which has an Emmy on the cover, but Mad Men did not win a single Emmy for that season.",2,The emperor has no clothes,1340236800,"06 21, 2012",2012,2216,"['agree', 'bits', 'pieces', 'reviews', 'also', 'wanted', 'like', 'Season', '5', 'love', 'have', 'watched', 'rewatched', 'Seasons', '1', '4', 'were', 'few', 'episodes', 'are', 'best', 'Mad', 'Men', 'ever', 'done', 'overall', 'found', 'Season', '5', 'whole', 'be', 'weak', 'thrown', 'together', 'never', 'felt', 'attached', 'particularly', 'interested', 'new', 'characters', 'were', 'introduced', 'many', 'felt', 'more', 'caricatures', 'rather', 'characters', 'Right', 'gate', 'found', 'marital', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'Don', 'Megan', 'irritating', 'tiresome', 'endless', 'agree', 'wholeheartedly', 'reviewer', 'said', 'episodes', '1', '2', 'were', 'linked', 'together', 'were', 'pilot', 'show', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'off', 'ground', 'episode', '13', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'much', 'more', 'could', 'watch', 'Megan', 'emoting', 'single', 'line', 'Don', 'wondered', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'Weiner', 'could', 'give', 'Jessica', 'Pare', 'was', 'never', 'bored', 'Betty', 'Don', 'Megan', 'Don', 'just', 'made', 'yawn', 'end', 'season', 'was', 'almost', 'depressed', 'see', 'end', 'was', 'so', 'hooked', 'wanted', 'keep', 'going', 'end', 'Season', '5', 'almost', 'was', 'relief', 'Considering', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'ever', 'done', 'could', 'almost', 'feel', 'Matthew', 'Weiner', 'boredom', 'grinding', 'scripts', 'when', 'read', 'reviews', 'say', 'best', 'season', 'ever', 'wonder', 'have', 'been', 'watching', 'same', 'series', 'Everyone', 'entitled', 'opinion', 'again', 'were', 'few', 'episodes', 'brilliance', 'not', 'enough', 'make', 'season', 'emmy', 'winner', 'Also', 'how', 'one', 'end', 'Season', '4', 'Megan', 'standing', 'balcony', 'telling', 'Don', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'actress', 'have', 'heard', 'mouth', 'nothing', 'drival', 'acting', ""'m"", 'going', 'vote', 'wallet', 'not', 'buy', 'Season', '5', 'comparing', 'Season', '5', 'previous', '4', 'seasons', 'comparing', 'Rod', 'Serling', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'later', 'Night', 'Gallery', 'Yes', 'think', 'Matthew', 'Weiner', 'genius', 'am', 'amazed', 'so', 'few', 'people', 'are', 'willing', 'say', 'emperor', 'clothes', 'Even', 'more', 'amusing', 'cover', 'Season', '5', 'dvd', 'case', 'Emmy', 'cover', 'Mad', 'Men', 'did', 'not', 'win', 'single', 'Emmy', 'season']",N/A

The season is set between Spring of 1966 and '67, as the Vietnam War was simmering to a boil, but the huge, historic anti-draft and anti-war demonstrations were still on the horizon, while the Civil Rights movement was in transition, having won huge Congressional victories in '64 and '65. Drug use was filtering its way into the mainstream (as seen hilariously in the episode ""Far Away Places""...) but the so-called Summer of Love hadn't happened yet. In short, New York was still swinging, and the show's focus remains on its characters more than on the trappings of the times they live in. In many ways this is one of the quietest seasons to date -- a lot happens, but it's more in the lives-of-quiet-desperation mode than the amped-up, somewhat exaggerated retro vibe of Seasons 1-4. Great stuff with Joanie and Don's new wife, Megan, as well as some choice bits with Roger, while Pete continues to devolve before our very eyes, and an oddly serene Don Draper becomes more inscrutable than ever. True tragedy and some major changes come at the season's end, and -- oh, boy! -- are we ready to see where Season Six takes us.

I recognize this environment veerrry well.  I am bemused by the reviewers in the blogs I have read concerning this show.  They express dismay that ""strong"" Joan has sold herself out.  First of all, I think Pete's handling of the proposition was masterful.  Both the acting and the writing were top notch.  Joan, whether or not her many fans (I am certainly one) wish to admit it, has been selling herself for decades.  She has picked and chosen men who would give her what she wanted.  By and large she has dated men (certainly like married Roger) who ""treat her right.""  Buy her presents, lavish opulent surroundings on her, etc.  She has perhaps deceived herself and not gotten the property (in her own name--job skill one for a courtesan) or reaped the long-term financial security a more focused woman doing what Joan does, would have achieved.  Joan has saddled a man she should never have married (but she did marry him for security, a ""Mrs."" and the status of marrying a doctor) with an expensive and fraudulent lie, while piously turning down Roger's checks (which, judiciously handled, could provide her with security).  Instead, she makes a pragmatic decision and, I feel, earns respect and not its obverse, from the men she works with--men who know her quite well.  I feel such immense fondness for Lane, in this situation, who, facing ruin, and with no ass to peddle, gives Joan wise counsel.  I feel for Joan, totally understand what she did, and, in the context of her own checkered life, feel she made the right decision.  The getting of wisdom and its real price--that's how I see this episode.",5,Exceptional character study and episode.,1338940800,"06 6, 2012",2012,1721,"['came', 'age', 'LA', 'very', 'late', '60', 'began', 'working', 'large', 'LA', 'corporations', 'early', '1970', 'recognize', 'environment', 'veerrry', 'well', 'am', 'bemused', 'reviewers', 'blogs', 'have', 'read', 'concerning', 'show', 'express', 'dismay', 'strong', 'Joan', 'sold', 'out', 'First', 'think', 'Pete', 'handling', 'proposition', 'was', 'masterful', 'acting', 'writing', 'were', 'top', 'notch', 'Joan', 'not', 'many', 'fans', 'am', 'certainly', 'one', 'wish', 'admit', 'been', 'selling', 'decades', 'picked', 'chosen', 'men', 'who', 'would', 'give', 'what', 'wanted', 'large', 'dated', 'men', 'certainly', 'married', 'Roger', 'who', 'treat', 'right', 'Buy', 'presents', 'lavish', 'opulent', 'surroundings', 'etc', 'perhaps', 'deceived', 'not', 'gotten', 'property', 'own', 'name', 'job', 'skill', 'one', 'courtesan', 'reaped', 'long-term', 'financial', 'security', 'more', 'focused', 'woman', 'doing', 'what', 'Joan', 'would', 'have', 'achieved', 'Joan', 'saddled', 'man', 'should', 'never', 'have', 'married', 'did', 'marry', 'security', 'Mrs.', 'status', 'marrying', 'doctor', 'expensive', 'fraudulent', 'lie', 'piously', 'turning', 'down', 'Roger', 'checks', 'judiciously', 'handled', 'could', 'provide', 'security', 'Instead', 'pragmatic', 'decision', 'feel', 'respect', 'not', 'obverse', 'men', 'men', 'who', 'know', 'quite', 'well', 'feel', 'such', 'immense', 'fondness', 'Lane', 'situation', 'who', 'facing', 'ruin', 'ass', 'peddle', 'Joan', 'wise', 'counsel', 'feel', 'Joan', 'totally', 'understand', 'what', 'did', 'context', 'own', 'checkered', 'life', 'feel', 'made', 'right', 'decision', 'getting', 'wisdom', 'real', 'price', 'how', 'see', 'episode']",N/A

I was anxious to see whether Season Five would be able to keep me ensnared after all that time.  And, I'm happy to say, I found Season Five to be everything I could have hoped for.The very handsome ladies' man, Don Draper, also possibly one of the most fascinating characters I've ever watched in any genre, seems in Season Five to have finally matured into a decent husband and family man.  With perky wife No. 2, Megan, he seems determined not to make the same mistakes he made with the gorgeous but grim-faced Betty.  Megan, a much more headstrong and modern version of Eve, tests his patience on several levels, while showing that beneath the sixties' glam-girl facade she is very much his equal in wanting her own way (and is pretty good at getting it).  The cast of characters at Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce are much the same, all vying for power, with Machiavellian Pete grasping for more than his share whenever possible.  Joan, everyone's favorite redhead, pulls some surprising moves that solidify her role at the company, while shaking off some of her more suffocating ties.  Peggy never disappoints in her role as the evolving career woman, and as for the rest...well, you'll just have to keep watching, because the drama is truly gripping.One thing I always admire about this show is that the plot moves along effortlessly, without some unbelievable event to push it in the right direction.  Everything in the show is nuanced and layered, as in real life, and if something tragic or wonderful happens, it seems to fit naturally in the course of events.  Weiner is fascinated, as always, by marriage, adultery, and moral issues, which are thankfully never resolved in a pat manner.  Glamorous as the characters in ""Mad Men"" look, they are nevertheless wrestling with the same things that challenge all of us -- mortgages, children, money, temptation, ambition.Two things remained with me after watching the entire season.

Our heroes have to go with the times and creative advertising for a changing world. Although I love the show, MADMEN seems to be slowing down. It seems like only troubled, narcisstic and egotistic men can find work in advertising along with one lady and a sexy female office manager. Few of these characters are likeable and all have morality issues yet we seem to like them. John Hamm continues to be a winner as the trouble Don Draper. Draper has long been on top of his game but now he is facing middle age and a new generation of consumers. After a surprise marriage to his secretary Megan, he now has the chance for love and happiness and domestic stability. He has it all but still has to fight his inner demonds.Lovely Jessica Par&eacute; brings warmth and fresh air to the series and Megan Draper. Maybe this marriage will work if Don gives it a chance.

Very few of the major male characters (including Don Draper) are in as proactive positions as they have been in past seasons, and instead we see the women as making the more dominant choices in the season, from Betty's long-deferred decision about advancing her career opportunities, to Joan's unexpected choices about what to do with her career and her marriage, and to the many surprising choices of Don's beautiful new bride Megan (Jessica Pare) to settle into married life. Don's ex-wife Betty is of course here again too, and makes some decisions of her own about getting her own life after her unhappiness at seeing her husband get remarried (which results in January Jones wearing prosthetics to make her seem quite fat, partially to cover the actress's real-life pregnancy), and the most dominant minor characters are two formidable mothers-in-law, Betty's (played by Pamela Dunlap--a favorite from last season), and Don's (played by Julia Ormond).""Why do [women] get to make all of the decisions?,"" Pete Campbell whines about his flirtation with the depressed bride of a fellow commuter. The answer, as this season seems to show, is that the men seem incapable by this point in the series of making their lives happen: all of their agency seems to have been drained away, not just by the onslaught of the real events of 1966 (the ongoing civil rights struggles, the mass murders of Richard Speck and Charles Whitman, the youth movement), but by their own inabilities to take command. Repeatedly the men in the show are seen at a real crossroads, watching their own rare decisions turn sour (as Lane Pryce does, in the series' most tragic subplot). Certainly this was not what would have been predicted for the path for this show to take when the show started, when the women were mostly trying to carve whatever small space they could in a Manhattan and suburban world dominated by greedy and ambitious men. But one of the best things about this series has consistently been its inability to remain stale: it keeps moving in different directions, and Don's new marriage to Megan (and their fabulous high-rise apartment) really takes this season in a new direction. The acting, like the writing, is, as usual, consistently high: Jon Hamm and Megan Pare do well with the biggest roles of the season, but they're nearly outshone by Christina Hendricks and Jared Harris, who are given here more than they've ever had to do before.This DVD set comes with better packaging than the last few, although some of the special features seem pretty superfluous: a history of Daylight's Saving Time seemed unnecessary, and the mini-profile of the painter Giorgio Di Chirico (which is here because he inspired the season's unremarkable poster) also doesn't seem terribly essential. The commentaries are always great, although Matt Weiner always dominates whichever ones he shares; still, since he knows more about the show than anyone else, this seems fair.",4,Ladies' choice,1351555200,"10 30, 2012",2012,3232,"['ubiquitous', 'commentaries', 'DVD', 'set', 'season', '5', 'MAD', 'MEN', 'series', 'creator', 'Matt', 'Weiner', 'repeatedly', 'theme', 'season', 'was', 'man', 'however', 'season', 'show', 'once', 'dominated', 'much', 'more', 'heavily', 'women', 'men', 'Very', 'few', 'major', 'male', 'characters', 'including', 'Don', 'Draper', 'are', 'proactive', 'positions', 'have', 'been', 'past', 'seasons', 'instead', 'see', 'women', 'making', 'more', 'dominant', 'choices', 'season', 'Betty', 'long-deferred', 'decision', 'advancing', 'career', 'opportunities', 'Joan', 'unexpected', 'choices', 'what', 'do', 'career', 'marriage', 'many', 'surprising', 'choices', 'Don', 'beautiful', 'new', 'bride', 'Megan', 'Jessica', 'Pare', 'settle', 'married', 'life', 'Don', 'ex-wife', 'Betty', 'course', 'here', 'again', 'too', 'decisions', 'own', 'getting', 'own', 'life', 'unhappiness', 'seeing', 'husband', 'get', 'remarried', 'results', 'January', 'Jones', 'wearing', 'prosthetics', 'make', 'seem', 'quite', 'fat', 'partially', 'cover', 'actress', 'real-life', 'pregnancy', 'most', 'dominant', 'minor', 'characters', 'are', 'two', 'formidable', 'mothers-in-law', 'Betty', 'played', 'Pamela', 'Dunlap', 'favorite', 'last', 'season', 'Don', 'played', 'Julia', 'Ormond', 'Why', 'do', '[', 'women', ']', 'get', 'make', 'decisions', 'Pete', 'Campbell', 'flirtation', 'depressed', 'bride', 'fellow', 'commuter', 'answer', 'season', 'show', 'men', 'seem', 'incapable', 'point', 'series', 'making', 'lives', 'happen', 'agency', 'have', 'been', 'drained', 'away', 'not', 'just', 'onslaught', 'real', 'events', '1966', 'ongoing', 'civil', 'rights', 'struggles', 'mass', 'murders', 'Richard', 'Speck', 'Charles', 'Whitman', 'youth', 'movement', 'own', 'inabilities', 'take', 'command', 'Repeatedly', 'men', 'show', 'are', 'seen', 'real', 'crossroads', 'watching', 'own', 'rare', 'decisions', 'turn', 'sour', 'Lane', 'Pryce', 'series', 'most', 'tragic', 'subplot', 'Certainly', 'was', 'not', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'predicted', 'path', 'show', 'take', 'when', 'show', 'started', 'when', 'women', 'were', 'mostly', 'trying', 'carve', 'small', 'space', 'could', 'Manhattan', 'suburban', 'world', 'dominated', 'greedy', 'ambitious', 'men', 'one', 'best', 'things', 'series', 'consistently', 'been', 'inability', 'remain', 'stale', 'moving', 'different', 'directions', 'Don', 'new', 'marriage', 'Megan', 'fabulous', 'high-rise', 'apartment', 'really', 'season', 'new', 'direction', 'acting', 'writing', 'usual', 'consistently', 'high', 'Jon', 'Hamm', 'Megan', 'Pare', 'do', 'well', 'biggest', 'roles', 'season', ""'re"", 'nearly', 'outshone', 'Christina', 'Hendricks', 'Jared', 'Harris', 'who', 'are', 'given', 'here', 'more', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'had', 'do', 'before.This', 'DVD', 'set', 'better', 'packaging', 'last', 'few', 'special', 'features', 'seem', 'pretty', 'superfluous', 'history', 'Daylight', 'Saving', 'Time', 'seemed', 'unnecessary', 'mini-profile', 'painter', 'Giorgio', 'Di', 'Chirico', 'here', 'inspired', 'season', 'unremarkable', 'poster', 'also', ""n't"", 'seem', 'terribly', 'essential', 'commentaries', 'are', 'always', 'great', 'Matt', 'Weiner', 'always', 'whichever', 'ones', 'shares', 'still', 'more', 'show', 'anyone', 'else', 'fair']",N/A

As a result, IMHO, I found that in past seasons episodes were uneven with what seemed like filler.I see that some reviewers who are likely MM ""traditionalists"" may be of the belief that the show has deviated off of the ""formula"" that made it great.  I respectively disagree. There are a number of scenes in season 5 that offer dramatic effect like a baseball bat to the head!Coming off of an 18-month hiatus, I sensed immediately that this season was going to be something different.  The first clue was the elimination of the running historical commentary re: the advertisers.  This was kind of cool for the first couple of seasons, though I was ready to move on.There is still the political incorrectness of the time, marital infidelities and even a character battling weight gain!  Season 5 adds drug use, public sex and even a musical performance!  The difference is the direction towards greater shock value.  For those purists that loved the last 4-seasons, the season 5 finale ends with traditional MM subtlety a la 007!What make this series good is that there is simply nothing like MM, foreign or domestic.  What makes the show great is the writing and acting.  What makes this season possibly one of the best of all time for a drama series, is the writing, acting and added visual shock value.With all the TV that I watch there are very few series and fewer episodes where I find myself constantly checking the time because the episode is so good that I simply don't want it too end!MM Season 5 gets my highest recco for a drama series.",5,"Metaphorically, They Traded in Pepper Spray for a Flame Thrower!

Transferring the purchase to the TiVo unit at first took a long time, but we soon determined that this was because the TiVo was also recording some TiVo suggestions programs. When we stopped those recordings, the transfer suddenly was much quicker. Still, you'll want to allow some time from purchase to when you want to start watching. This isn't quite on-demand.The Season 5 starts off strong, with all our regular characters from Season 4. The themes again are more about the new business and Don's personal life. The earlier themes of the misery, alienation, cheating, resentments of suburban middle class life are thankfully attenuated. Then again, you never quite know what to expect in this show, which is one of its charms. It's great to see the show back with season 5 without losing a step or feeling like the writers were all replaced or got bored with the concept and decided to reinvent it so they would be more entertained.Mad Men is my latest television pleasure. A great show! If you haven't been watching it, do yourself a favor and start from the beginning. It's not your ordinary TV show.

I have 3 different sound cards in my computer (well, 4, but one of them wouldn't have really been an option in this case) and I cannot get 5.1 audio out of any of them. Have tried using 6 channel analog out, HDMI, and optical s/pdif and NONE of them produce 5.1 sound. Of course, they do with BDs, HD-DVDs, DVDs, and other files encoded with DD and DTS audio, but not with unbox. This is annoying and just plain stupid. I'd be willing to bet that it's a DRM issue and, once again, DRM just hurts the people who are trying to use content that they paid for. There is probably a hacker out there right now who is cracking the DRM on this and enjoying the sound and quality that I'm paying for. This is just great.ETA: I was pretty grumpy when I wrote this and did the thing that I don't like in reviews-- when people review something other than the movie/show/etc. I still say to avoid Unbox for now-- even on 20mbps connection I get frequent buffering and an interruption offering to make the quality worse-- seriously, can you at least ad a ""do not ask me this question again"" option?

1409561,A3KEZLJ59C1JVH,B004HW7JH4,Melissa Niksic,"[4, 6]","I don't understand all the negative commentary I've heard about Season 5. Critics have said that the pacing is too slow and that many of the characters behave erratically. People, this is ""Mad Men!"" It's subtle. Things progress slowly, and that's not a bad thing. As for people behaving out of character, I think that's inaccurate as well. Many of the characters go through major changes this season: changes in their relationships, changes at work, changes in their priorities. All of these changes are things that our leading man, Don Draper, is dealing with this season. Without giving anything away, I'll just say that he has created a whole new life for himself this season, and he is determined to make it work. That means he tries to make changes in his life, and some of them are more successful than others.Other characters evolve as well: Peggy grows continually frustrated with her work over at Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce. Joan deals with a lot of major changes in her personal life, and is faced with some very difficult decisions that may shape her future. Roger is...well, Roger! There is an awesome episode that is really all about Roger, and it's one of the best episodes of the season by far. Betty also deals with some, ahem, pretty big changes this season, which are downright hilarious, in my opinion. Pete kind of enters an early mid-life crisis this season and gets punched in the face a lot, which is always a good time. Sally, one of my favorite characters on the show, continues to steal every scene she's in. (When the show eventually ends, I hope we get a Sally Draper spin-off somehow.) And then there's Lane, a character who spins off into a direction I didn't expect, and as a result, the third-to-last episode of the season is the most shocking and jarring of the show to date. The final two episodes deal with the fallout of what happens, and while there isn't a super dramatic cliffhanger, the audience is left wondering which side of Don Draper's personality will shine through in the opening scenes of the first episode of Season Six.All in all, Season Five was outstanding and completely met and exceeded my expectations, as is usually the case with ""Mad Men.""

Who'll hold my hair back while I puke? The character of Don seems tired and listless.  You feel like the actor, not the character, had the flu the whole time while filming.Please take note.

As the new millennium keeps disappointing us, TV shows set on the 50's and the 60's (once a rarity) keep growing in numbers. Many have tried and failed. MAD MEN tried and closed the deal. And have been doing so for 5 seasons now.Meet Don Draper (Jon Ham), a Madison Avenue water-walker (and based on the real life ad men Draper Daniels and Rosser Reeves). He is an enigma wrapped in a mystery. He is brilliant and secretive. He wants to keep walking the tight rope with no safety net. And definitely no contract. He is a chain-smoking, hard liqueur guzzling, womanizing alpha male. He is a loving father of three, married to a picture-perfect ex model. He has it all. And yet he cannot find peace. Because he learned early on that the world is always yawning at your heels, eager to yank everything you love away.From bursting with joie-de-vivre Roger Sterling (hilarious John Slattery) and ever scheming Pete Cambell (baby-faced Vincent Kartheiser) to the gorgeous women (such as barbie January Jones and refined Jessica Par&eacute; as his first and second wife, respectively), the cast is one perfect pick after another. And the writing is brilliant, reproducing the tastes and smells and nuisances of the era around Camelot, while drawing you in to the personal stories of characters polished yet inevitably flawed.The 50's and the 60's were before my time so it is not nostalgia that makes me love the show. Yes, I find the era mesmerizing and (probably undeservingly) less complicated. If nothing else, though, back then they knew how to dress. Women looked feminine and men looked manly. You see January Jones on the red carpet, for example, all dressed up and groomed for a Hollywood function - and that modern image cannot hold a candle to herself dressed for everyday(!) life in the 50's. When did we loose it? When did we decide men should stop wearing suits and hats and women should start wearing sweat-suits outside the house? I, for one, blame the hippies!This is one of the best TV shows ever and this box-set includes season 5. Season 6 is eminent whereas season 7 has already been green-lighted. As I have said again before, good TV is best watched on DVD. Make weekends out of it. It is much more enjoyable to watch an entire season in a couple of days than having to wait week(s) between episodes.

But to say that would be like saying champagne is just grape soda pop.  Mad Men is so well-written that it is consistent only in its ability to take you by surprise.  For example, it's not surprising that Don Draper would impulsively marry his secretary in a kind of mid-life crisis.  But the dynamics of that relationship are anything but expected!  Here is this philandering character who has a very hard time saying &#34;no&#34; to almost any woman he meets, but something about this lovely younger woman seems to bring out his more human and vulnerable side.  He truly loves her.  All  of the relationships in this drama are nuanced and multi-layered.  There is a lot of dry humor, which distinguishes it from most of the &#34;serious&#34; dramas out there.

1409612,A3VAXB8CDYY5BG,B004HW7JH4,The Wingchair Critic,"[3, 6]","'Mad Men' Season Five (2012) represents the AMC period drama in steep decline, though the program is generally so much better than most scripted television today that the current season is still mildly entertaining.The main problem with Season Five is that  it no longer seems like a pointed and narrowly-focused window into America's recent past.Where the first several seasons seemed to have so much to say about late 50s and early-to-mid 60s America, with Season Five, 'Mad Men' often becomes a parody of itself; and the show almost went off the rails completely in the second season, when, in campy episode 24, 'The Jet Set' (written by creator Matthew Weiner), protagonist, anti-hero and sociopath Don Draper (Jon Hamm), while traveling to California on business, is taken up by a band of wealthy, sex-loving, and intinerant Europeans who treat him like a lesser second coming of Steve Reeves.Season Five is full of bad ideas, such as having the shapely and beautiful Betty Francis (January Jones), Don's ex-wife, spontaneously gaining an excessive amount of weight and attending what are often shown to be humiliating Weight Watchers classes with her fellow Westchester housewives. Though it first seems that Betty's weight gain may be due to cancer, her doctor shortly informs her that such weight gain is merely a part of ""middle age.""The scene in which the dieting Betty walks into her dark and isolated kitchen and guzzles pressurized Ready Whip out of the can before spitting it into the sink is a conspicuous example of the sort of weak and cliched writing that rears its head throughout Season Five. The viewer can only imagine how Jones must have reacted when she first learned of the direction in which her character was being taken.Season Five further becomes a parody when Roger (John Slattery) and his shrewish second wife, Jane (Peyton List) take LSD with posh friends at a party. Though the two scenes involved are clever and humorous, ultimately, it is scenes like these which cheapen the show and underscore its decline.Another, and far more important, script flummox in Season Five is Don's unilateral firing of CFO Lane Pryce, who has embezzled a relatively small amount of money, which he intended to return to the company coffers within two weeks. Though it is indeed Don's signature Lane has forged, it is simply unbelievable, on every level, that Don would fire Lane immediately, and that Lane would not insist on a meeting of the company's partners (of which he is one). Since testicle-free company patriarch Bertram Cooper had some knowledge of the check in question, it is even more unbelievable that Don would act as he does.Finally, it's not credible that Lane, who is a married man and father, would commit suicide rather admit his crime and beg for the mercy of his other partners, for whom he has made great sacrifices of a financial nature in the past.However, 'Mad Men' Season Five proverbially 'jumps the shark' when it asks its audience to believe that liberal former copywriter and general oddball Paul Kinsey (Michael Gladis) would become a toga-wearing, shaven-headed member of the Hare Krishna movement. All of these scenes, which are badly written and executed to an almost unbelievable degree, and which also involve Kinsey's former co-worker and sometime friend Harry Crane (Rich Sommer), simply sink the season once and finally. Scenes such as these fully telescope to the audience that Weiner and company simply have nothing left to say, and are thus grasping wildly at straws.After the Hare Krishna scenes, we know how 'Mad Men' will eventually end: with a stoned, unshaven, and utterly dissolute Don Draper naked in a California hot tub, with long hair and a headband, mumbling 'Radar Love' under his breath. Not with a Bang, but a Whimper.Another pointless, daytime soap opera-like plot development: newlyweds and new parents Joan Harris (Joan Holloway) and Dr. Greg Harris (Sam Page) separate and begin divorce proceedings because Greg has decided to take a second tour of duty in Viet Nam.Season Five of 'Mad Men' has some good moments (such as Peter and Trudy's Saturday night dinner party and Don and Megan's Howard Johnson's adventure), but feels largely thin and flaccid as a whole. It is no longer the riveting (if highly manipulative) drama it once was.  Scenarios like that in which the mature Canadian mother of Don's third wife Megan (Jessica Pare) performs oral coitus on Roger, in semipublic and within hours of meeting him, are ludicrous. &#8232;&#8232;It's as if the producers and writers simply can't think up enough degrading acts for these characters to engage in, most of whom are shown to be highly flawed and anti-Semitic, racist, sexist, sociopathic, hypersexual, adulterous, morally and ethically vacant, alcoholic, emotionally shallow, chronically dissatisfied, greedy, callow and so on. They're even litterers.Weiner has said the show will run seven seasons and no more, though that decision may have changed. Whether 'Mad Men' can regain its sense of purpose remains to be seen; Don certainly does some tricky maneuvering on the water skis here.",3,"Don Draper, Fraud & Sociopath, Jumps The

My past favorite TV shows (LOST, X-Files, Smallville, 24) pretty much all focused on over-arching plots from episode to episode.  &#34;Mad Men&#34; uses a similar strategy...but with characters instead of plot points,  By this season, the show has developed such a stable of incredible characters that you can't help but what to see what will happen to them all.By this point in the show, there are just so many juicy stories going on that it truly takes an entire season to get them all enough screen time!  For example:-The &#34;business stuff&#34; with Don Draper (Jon Hamm) and his work partners like Peggy (Elisabeth Moss), Pete (Vincent Kartheiser), Harry (Rich Sommer), Ken (Aaron Staten), Roger (John Slattery), Bert (Robert Morse), and Lane (Jared Harris).-Joan Harris (Christina Hendricks) and husband Greg (Sam Page) try to get things straightened out.-Personal players in Don's life such as new wife Megan (Jessica Pare), old wife Betty (January Jones), and daughter Sally (Kiernan Shipka).-Even some new blood in the character of Michael Ginsberg (Ben Feldmen) is introduced, while Paul Kinsey (Micheal Gladis) re-surfaces for a brief period.There are no set plot arcs to this show, but rather it just shows the lives of all those characters and how they interact with each other and the world.  Show creator Matthew Weiner has such a deft touch at making them all interesting that by now the &#34;formula&#34; (if one can use such a simple term like that to describe something so complex) is set: In just a 13 episode season, focusing on the characters described above alone is plenty of material!After a noticeable drop in standards during the second season and the beginning of the third, this show has been hitting on all cylinders since that point.
