It's fun to see these characters do ballet and you really can't beat the Nutcraker Suite as the majority of the background music. Aside from the Tchaikovsky, there is some neat numbers that were added.I think this is the first time I've seen the Triplet Kittens from &#34;Triplet Trouble&#34; used for more than just cameosThis movie really has a charming feel to it. What is really enjoying about this feature is how much the music is involved in the animation. Yes, there are characters that speak, but more often then not it's the music that &#34;speaks&#34; more and drives the action.The Bad:Tuffy's atrocious French accent! BOO! Speaking of accents, the Toy Elf's accent is far worse than Tuffy's. The Cat King, not really liking the introduction of a new villain like that, not sure why they chose a different cat as a main villain, than say, Butch who has always been a foil for Tom.The Ugly:The accents! Really! Couldn't someone have found better voice actors for Tuffy and the Elf. The voices of these characters are totally distracting from the enjoyment of this little film.Overall I like this. It's a fun little movie once you get passed the accents and the cat king.
