695603,A1123L7ANYUTG0,B000063K1A,Hugo 77,"[7, 8]","Run the Wild Fields is about a woman[Whalley] whose husband is gone, fighting in WWII, and has been missing in action for some time. She's bringing up her daughter by herself on the family farm, when a mysterious stranger shows up and enters their lives. This is a familiar premise, the drama set before us being: 1.what will we learn about the stranger, and 2. how will the stranger affect his hosts? And of course, in a typical Hollywood film, you expect lust-driven sparks to fly.Yes, things do happen, but not what you might expect. Maybe this particular story is a useful corrective, in its own way, to Adrian Lyne-style melodramatic excesseses, of which you certainly can't accuse the makers of this picture. Still the kid [Alex Vega] is pretty good, in what could've been a treacly, insuffrably sweet role. The adults are ok too.a slight revision 9/2005: I first reviewed this in 2004. I saw RTWF a 2nd time recently, and  it grows on you-- still no melodrama, but  Joanne Whalley and Sean Patrick Flanery are better as the romantic leads than I first allowed for. Both performances have a sort of antidramatic calm about them-- as if the characters simply ""are,"" and you have to go to them, watching perhaps a bit more intently for shadings and nuance than you might be accustomed to, participating in the unfolding of the narrative, as it were.I guess, over the years, I've grown accustomed to allowing for that sort of minimalism in Asian and European pictures, but not American ones.",3,an atypical tale of forbidden love...,1076457600,"02 11, 2004",2004,1494,"['Run', 'Wild', 'Fields', 'woman', '[', 'Whalley', ']', 'husband', 'gone', 'fighting', 'WWII', 'been', 'missing', 'action', 'time', 'bringing', 'up', 'daughter', 'herself', 'family', 'farm', 'when', 'mysterious', 'stranger', 'up', 'enters', 'lives', 'familiar', 'premise', 'drama', 'set', 'being', '1.what', 'will', 'learn', 'stranger', '2.', 'how', 'will', 'stranger', 'affect', 'hosts', 'course', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'expect', 'lust-driven', 'sparks', 'fly.Yes', 'things', 'do', 'happen', 'not', 'what', 'might', 'expect', 'Maybe', 'particular', 'story', 'useful', 'corrective', 'own', 'way', 'Adrian', 'Lyne-style', 'melodramatic', 'excesseses', 'certainly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'accuse', 'makers', 'picture', 'Still', 'kid', '[', 'Alex', 'Vega', ']', 'pretty', 'good', 'what', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'treacly', 'insuffrably', 'sweet', 'role', 'adults', 'are', 'ok', 'too.a', 'slight', 'revision', '9/2005', 'first', 'reviewed', '2004', 'saw', 'RTWF', '2nd', 'time', 'recently', 'still', 'melodrama', 'Joanne', 'Whalley', 'Sean', 'Patrick', 'Flanery', 'are', 'better', 'romantic', 'leads', 'first', 'allowed', 'performances', 'have', 'sort', 'antidramatic', 'calm', 'characters', 'simply', 'are', 'have', 'go', 'watching', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'more', 'intently', 'shadings', 'nuance', 'might', 'be', 'accustomed', 'participating', 'unfolding', 'narrative', 'guess', 'years', ""'ve"", 'grown', 'accustomed', 'allowing', 'sort', 'minimalism', 'Asian', 'European', 'pictures', 'not', 'American', 'ones']",N/A

It is about a little girl named Opal, and her mother Ruby, who had a very special man named Tom, that came into their life!Ruby's husband was a soldier in the war (WWII), and he had been missing in action for three years! Some people thought that he could be dead by now! But Ruby and Opal tried not to give up hope, that one day he'd would return!Tom came at a time ,when Ruby and Opal needed a man in their life to help them in so many wonderful ways!Opal found Tom hurt in a field, and her and her mother helped care for him! Ruby noticed that he was a kind and thoughful man, so she let him stay and help her with the farm, but the town folk and Silas (a man who wanted Ruby), was very against Tom staying with Ruby and Opal. Lies and town rumors and gossip, and a jealous hate, caused trouble for Tom and Ruby and Opal! Especially for Ruby and Tom, because they where starting to fall in love with each other!When a fire occurs at a town celebration, the town finds out what kind of man ,Tom really is! And things change when Opal receives an amazing letter from overseas!

For some reason, they are brushed aside in the film world, to make way for some garbage or another.I saw this movie several years ago, probably on T.V. It won me over with its warmth, setting, characters, and story. It's a sweet, family movie that only needs a bowl of popcorn, and maybe a tissue or two.Joanne Whalley is a timeless, stunning woman who commands the attention of the audience in her roles. I first saw her in Willow, and was happy to see that she's just as talented and lovely years later in this subtle love story. Sean Patrick Flannery is as good-a-looking man as you'll ever want to see as the hero of this flick. If his looks alone don't win you over, his character will. And then there is Miss Alexa Vega-- ""Pug""--, the adorable, sassy daughter of Joanne Whalley's character. The atmosphere of this movie hangs in the air, trailing the onset of WWII with the foggy, tail end memories of the years during the Great Depression. And while it may not be the most mysterious, or pulse-racing film out there, it's a character driven story about the war-time home front that is more engaging and realistic than any car chaser with a weak storyline and weaker characterization.",5,"""On those bright mornings, my hope and I would run those wild fields...""",1335657600,"04 29, 2012",2012,1388,"['gave', 'mother', 'hands', 'heart', 'hope', 'very', 'small', 'way', 'very', 'short', 'time', '-PugI', 'have', 'times', 'stumbled', 'gems', 'movies', 'receive', 'far', 'too', 'little', 'credit', 'reason', 'are', 'brushed', 'aside', 'film', 'world', 'make', 'way', 'garbage', 'another.I', 'saw', 'movie', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'probably', 'T.V', 'won', 'over', 'warmth', 'setting', 'characters', 'story', 'sweet', 'family', 'movie', 'only', 'bowl', 'popcorn', 'maybe', 'tissue', 'two.Joanne', 'Whalley', 'timeless', 'stunning', 'woman', 'who', 'attention', 'audience', 'roles', 'first', 'saw', 'Willow', 'was', 'happy', 'see', 'just', 'as', 'talented', 'lovely', 'years', 'later', 'subtle', 'love', 'story', 'Sean', 'Patrick', 'Flannery', 'good-a-looking', 'man', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'want', 'see', 'hero', 'flick', 'alone', 'do', ""n't"", 'win', 'over', 'character', 'will', 'then', 'Miss', 'Alexa', 'Vega', 'Pug', 'adorable', 'sassy', 'daughter', 'Joanne', 'Whalley', 'character', 'atmosphere', 'movie', 'air', 'trailing', 'onset', 'WWII', 'foggy', 'tail', 'end', 'memories', 'years', 'Great', 'Depression', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'most', 'mysterious', 'pulse-racing', 'film', 'there', 'character', 'driven', 'story', 'war-time', 'home', 'front', 'more', 'engaging', 'realistic', 'car', 'chaser', 'weak', 'storyline', 'weaker', 'characterization']",N/A
