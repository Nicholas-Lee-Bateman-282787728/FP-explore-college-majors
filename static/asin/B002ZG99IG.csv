My review is based upon viewing the theatrical trailer, the previews, and reading the Wikipedia synopsis.After viewing the preview and the trailer, I was 99% interested.  The preview featured a well-shot intro, establishing scene and introducting the main character.  Beautiful location shots, the lead actress looked very credible.  The storyline struck me as comparable to ""Single White Female"" with a college student ""twist.""  However, it also seemed to have some interesting, original plot points as well. The soundtrack was also very ""catchy"" and appealing.WARNING SPOILERThen I read the synopsis and discovered the plotline includes -- Ta-DAH! -- a kitten killing scene (allegedly, the psychotic roommate kills a pet kitten belonging to one of the other characters.)  That was an ""instant dealbreaker"" for me. I loathe that particular cliche (psychotic female kills cat or kitten, often in a particularly brutal way.)END SPOILERI'm very disappointed.  I might still rent the film, because what I saw looked pretty good in terms of production values.  I'm just tired of that particular scenario.

1312593,A2582KMXLK2P06,B002ZG99IG,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","The main problem with the Roommate is that it doesn't set out to do anything that you've most likely already seen plenty of times in other suspense films involving a calm person starting out nice and innocent and eventually turning into a murder-happy psychotic nutcase the more comfortable they become with the object of their obsession.What makes this one worse than most is that the storyline is based around really forgettable writing concerning college kids that enjoy the party lifestyle, so it's harder to take these characters seriously which slowly but surely deteriorates the writing.  Any potential this movie could have had disappears with every predictable segment we're forced to watch.  This film never steps away from the predictability which is what clearly makes it inferior to other suspense films with the same concept.Crazy girl becoming obsessed with her roommate?  Check.  Crazy girl showing signs of controlling the person they're obsessed with by staying up late waiting for her roommate to come home from a date and inexplicably yell at her like a mother who's daughter is late for her curfew?  Check.  Crazy person kills a pretty kitty cat by putting it in the washing machine (or dryer) in a pitiful and desperate attempt to pretend to have sympathy which in turns just makes the obsession even stronger once the victims tearful weak side is revealed over the sad news and needs someone to comfort?  Sorry for the run-on sentence there, but it's all here!None of this is remotely compelling to me however, and if you've seen films such as the Hand That Rocks the Cradle and Single White Female, I highly doubt it will be compelling to you either.  I believe this film is directed for the younger crowd which is why the writers went with a college environment.

1312595,AG5XM49AZVIYH,B002ZG99IG,"Ben ""Pizza Enthusiast""","[0, 0]","I imagine anyone over the age of 18 who likes to watch movies has seen ""The Roommate"" already. Not this film necessarily, but something very similar to it (""Chloe,"" ""The Crush,"" and ""Fatal Attraction"" all come to mind). The plot is cliche and entirely predictable (girl gets stuck with weird roommate who progressively gets more strange and more violent); the acting is decent enough, but no one steals the show. To be fair, this is more attributable to poor, unoriginal writing than any shortcomings on the actors' part. But that leads us to another problem: the casting.The only main character (if you can call her that) who was actually college-aged when this film came out is Aly Michalka, whose role as Tracy is relatively small and unimportant. Of the remaining characters, the only one who could pass for a college student is Rebecca, the antagonist played by Leighton Meester. Both the protagonist Sara (Minka Kelly), her ex-boyfriend (Matt Lanter), and her frat-boy boyfriend (Cam Gigandet) were much too old for this film, and it distracted me throughout to see these oldsters meander around a college campus. Moreover, I was struck by the incredibly spacious and egregiously furnished college dorm rooms they enjoyed. I know, I know. It's a movie; they have to make it look nice to entice people to watch. But come on. I have never been to the University of Los Angeles, where this film takes place (though I believe it was shot at USC), but I can't imagine it is actually home to such prestine facilities. Anyone who has been to college will laugh openly at the set. As a current college student, I was rolling my eyes throughout.On the other hand, I was surprised to see that this film did an adequate job of capturing college night life. While the frat party was slightly overblown, and Gigandet's character was way too nice to be a real frat-boy, everything else was indicative of the ""real thing."" In one disturbingly realistic bar scene, two drooling bar-rats send drinks over to Sara and Tracy, who obligingly drain the contents and leave the viewer terrified that they have just been drugged. Thankfully, the filmmakers did not deem it necessary to further explore this situation.By the film's end, I found that despite its flaws I had somewhat enjoyed it. The dialogue is above-par, the writers successfully created the tension they sought (albeit through entirely unoriginal material), and the characters are all easy on the eyes. However, there is nothing memorable about ""The Roomate""; while it wasn't a bad film, it just is not very exciting. Even when ""The Roommate"" does heat up, the viewer is more likely to compare it to a dozen other films that follow the same plot rather than become engrossed in it, and the ending was not only cliche bu also anti-climactic. ""The Roommate"" certainly is not worthy of a second viewing. In fact, I am still struggling to determine why I deemed it worth my time in the first place. I can think of dozens of movies I should have watched instead; you should too.",2,"Nothing exciting, nothing new.",1356393600,"12 25, 2012",2012,3022,"['imagine', 'anyone', 'age', '18', 'who', 'watch', 'movies', 'seen', 'Roommate', 'already', 'Not', 'film', 'necessarily', 'something', 'very', 'similar', 'Chloe', 'Crush', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'come', 'mind', 'plot', 'cliche', 'entirely', 'predictable', 'girl', 'stuck', 'weird', 'roommate', 'who', 'progressively', 'more', 'strange', 'more', 'violent', 'acting', 'decent', 'enough', 'one', 'show', 'be', 'fair', 'more', 'attributable', 'poor', 'unoriginal', 'writing', 'shortcomings', 'actors', 'part', 'problem', 'casting.The', 'only', 'main', 'character', 'can', 'call', 'who', 'was', 'actually', 'college-aged', 'when', 'film', 'came', 'out', 'Aly', 'Michalka', 'role', 'Tracy', 'relatively', 'small', 'unimportant', 'remaining', 'characters', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'could', 'pass', 'college', 'student', 'Rebecca', 'antagonist', 'played', 'Leighton', 'Meester', 'protagonist', 'Sara', 'Minka', 'Kelly', 'ex-boyfriend', 'Matt', 'Lanter', 'frat-boy', 'boyfriend', 'Cam', 'Gigandet', 'were', 'much', 'too', 'old', 'film', 'distracted', 'see', 'oldsters', 'meander', 'college', 'campus', 'Moreover', 'was', 'struck', 'incredibly', 'spacious', 'egregiously', 'furnished', 'college', 'dorm', 'rooms', 'enjoyed', 'know', 'know', 'movie', 'have', 'make', 'look', 'nice', 'entice', 'people', 'watch', 'come', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'University', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'where', 'film', 'place', 'believe', 'was', 'shot', 'USC', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'actually', 'home', 'such', 'prestine', 'facilities', 'Anyone', 'who', 'been', 'college', 'will', 'laugh', 'openly', 'set', 'current', 'college', 'student', 'was', 'rolling', 'eyes', 'throughout.On', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'surprised', 'see', 'film', 'did', 'adequate', 'job', 'capturing', 'college', 'night', 'life', 'frat', 'party', 'was', 'slightly', 'overblown', 'Gigandet', 'character', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'nice', 'be', 'real', 'frat-boy', 'everything', 'else', 'was', 'indicative', 'real', 'thing', 'one', 'disturbingly', 'realistic', 'bar', 'scene', 'two', 'drooling', 'bar-rats', 'send', 'drinks', 'Sara', 'Tracy', 'who', 'obligingly', 'drain', 'contents', 'leave', 'viewer', 'terrified', 'have', 'just', 'been', 'drugged', 'Thankfully', 'filmmakers', 'did', 'not', 'deem', 'necessary', 'further', 'explore', 'film', 'end', 'found', 'flaws', 'had', 'somewhat', 'enjoyed', 'dialogue', 'above-par', 'writers', 'successfully', 'created', 'tension', 'sought', 'entirely', 'unoriginal', 'material', 'characters', 'are', 'easy', 'eyes', 'However', 'nothing', 'memorable', 'Roomate', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'film', 'just', 'not', 'very', 'exciting', 'Even', 'when', 'Roommate', 'heat', 'up', 'viewer', 'more', 'likely', 'compare', 'dozen', 'other', 'films', 'follow', 'same', 'plot', 'rather', 'become', 'engrossed', 'ending', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'cliche', 'bu', 'also', 'anti-climactic', 'Roommate', 'certainly', 'not', 'worthy', 'second', 'viewing', 'fact', 'am', 'still', 'struggling', 'determine', 'why', 'deemed', 'time', 'first', 'place', 'can', 'think', 'dozens', 'movies', 'should', 'have', 'watched', 'instead', 'should', 'too']",N/A

I'm a dog lover in the first degree, but this doesn't mean that I hate cats.  In fact, I think hurting any animal is a terrible thing, but you knew it was going to happen.  In fact, you knew everything that was going to happen before it even entered the script, simply because the title alone is cliche'd, so shame on me for expecting something else.  At least a viewer would have the decency to dislike it highly after being exposed to such a lousy film.  Leighton Meester is the only cast member under 30 that I ever heard of before, and that's only because I admittedly watch Lifetime once in a while.  Minka Kelly's character takes so long to figure out what kind of psycho she's living with you wonder how low of an IQ even a fashion designer has to have to get into THAT college.  When the writing's on the wall, READ it!I am surprised at the appearance of an excellent actress like Francis Fisher in this poor ripoff of Single White Female and Fatal Attraction, but they can have Billy Zane, the king of heavy eyeliner, because he's appallingly bad no matter what movie he's in, so he fits right in with the younger cast.  I have never seen anyone so old playing roles that are a desperate attempt to make him look cool to an audience so far out of his age range.  It's time for him to play daddies and bosses instead of some funky looking enigma, because he can't carry it off any better than the stiff and lifeless Dermott Mulroney can play romantic roles.Full of overused cliche's, a bad script, and predictable from start to finish, this movie is a complete waste of time.  It's not boring, but it does leave you rolling your eyes so much that you resemble Little Orphan Annie all too frequently.  Hell, now that I think about it, you're better off watching Annie.

But even if ""Single White Female"" hadn't been made, this movie would still be about as boring and predictable as they get. It's little more than a visual checklist of thriller clich&eacute;s. Not those fun, stylistic clich&eacute;s, but the dull and dreary ones, all of which were unoriginal twenty years ago and have long since overstayed their welcome. If you can't figure out where the plot will go as you watch it unfold, you're either lucky, for you've missed all the thrillers I've sat through, or you're remarkably imperceptive.

Assigned to share her dorm room is Rebecca Woods (Leighton Meester), born and raised in the affluence of Beverly Hills. At first, they get along swimmingly. But over time, Rebecca's behavior becomes increasingly odd, as if she wanted Sara all to herself. Mostly, it displays itself not through her interactions with Sara, but through her interactions with other people in Sara's life. These include her new boyfriend, Stephen (Cam Gigandet), her friend, Tracy (Alyson Michalka), her fashion mentor, Irene (Danneel Harris), and Professor Roberts (Billy Zane), who teaches design. At Thanksgiving, Rebecca takes Sara to meet her wealthy parents; the mom (Frances Fisher) will eventually ask Sara in private the obvious question, ""Is she taking her medication?""Most of the characters are so transparent that they might as well walk around with labels hanging around their necks. I'll refrain from the two leads, since I've pretty much described them already. But you'd enjoy reading the one for Professor Roberts; his expressions and sly glances at Sara would equate to, ""I'm the lecherous creep who can't control himself around women."" Tracy's would read, ""I'm the unreliable party girl,"" while Irene's would read, ""I'm the clueless lesbian."" As for Stephen, the frat house drummer boy, his would read, ""I'm the only decent guy on campus who will love Sara for who she really is."" There isn't much more I can say about the character, but regarding Gigandet, he should thank his lucky stars that, at age twenty-eight, he looks young enough to pass for a college student.As Rebecca systematically takes care of anyone who gets between her and Sara, two plot points are introduced, neither of which is developed beyond its purpose as a thriller contrivance. The first is Sara's ex-boyfriend (Matt Lanter), who repeated calls and is eventually teased by Rebecca when she suddenly has access to Sara's cell phone. The second is the sudden appearance of a kitten, who Sara dubs Cuddles. Only one thing can happen when a cute, innocent animal has a guest spot in a movie like this. If you don't know what that thing is, please, don't make me tell you. As a cat owner, it's not something I enjoy dwelling on or even mentioning.I'm tempted to issue a spoiler warning so that I can discuss in detail the ways in which the ending fails to deliver. It's traditional in thrillers for the final confrontation to be implausible, but it isn't often they're so devoid of style; the face-off between Sara and Rebecca is short and shows a painful lack of motivation. Is it because writer Sonny Mallhi exhausted all possible clich&eacute;s by the fortieth page of the screenplay and simply stopped trying? What I find really disappointing is that, in spite of the unoriginal plot, he demonstrates on more than one occasion that he has an ear for dialogue, and you don't find that too often in movies like this. If he could apply this talent to more fulfilling story, he may have a future in showbiz.I find these kinds of movies incredibly frustrating, mostly because they suggest a severe lack of confidence in the audience, as if the filmmakers - or perhaps the studio, or both - don't trust that people are by in large intelligent. To release ""The Roommate"" and actually expect moviegoers to be thrilled by it is insulting. Thrills are by definition surprising. Surprises are by definition unforeseen. They're also by definition impossible in a story that thrives on tiresome formulas and cardboard characters. But by taking the time to point this out, I realize I've been just as condescending as the people who made this movie. You don't need me to spell this out for you. You're reading this right now, and I know you're smart.

1312601,A31ATJR2RAVD5G,B002ZG99IG,Christopher Engel,"[0, 0]","I took Zyprexa for two years for psychosis. This film doesn't even care what psychosis is, much less the drug olanzapine, or the brand of it called Zyprexa, which Rebecca is supposed to be taking and isn't, hence her antisocial, dependent, and psychopathic behavior. The film implies without any ambiguity that the medication is to keep her from being dependent or criminal. But Zyprexa would do absolutely nothing whatsoever for either of those things, making this film totally retarded.Pro tip: Psychosis=/=Psychopathy. Psychosis is things like hallucinations, delusions, unintelligible speech, and the like. Talking with a psychotic person is often impossible because they can't think coherently, much less plan a murder. They'd have a hard enough time planning a single sentence in a lot of cases. Yet this film turns Zyprexa (which is properly called olanzapine because Zyprexa is a brand, not a chemical composition, but is faked on the prop bottle when you see it on-screen) into an anti-antisocial drug, or anti-psychopathy drug. If Rebecca actually suffered from psychosis and refused to take Zyprexa for it, she couldn't form a coherent thought, much less scheme to kill all the people threatening her relationship with her roommate. She'd be overtly and obviously out of her mind and wouldn't have the mental capacity to hide it. Psychosis, clinically, literally means a break with reality, so she would have no idea her behavior is strange--if she were bipolar or schizophrenic and not taking medication for it which she would need, she wouldn't be going to school at all.That's not the same thing as psychopathy, which is what she is in this film: a psychopath. Psychopathy makes it feel okay to do grossly immoral, criminal, and antisocial acts, without any remorse whatsoever. That's psychopathy, not psychosis. Zyprexa would do absolutely nothing about that, particularly considering that psychopathy is an extreme form of antisocial personality disorder, not a psychotic disorder, two totally different things, neither of which is portrayed even remotely accurately in the film.The weird thing is, the film says it's to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Well, that's true, Zyprexa can be used to treat either of those, so at least they got that right. Except Rebecca doesn't appear to suffer from either of those conditions in any way whatsoever. She's a little moody, but definitely not to a pathological level. She has literally zero symptoms of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, at least to a pathological degree. She's clearly antisocial and also dependent, and Zyprexa would do nothing for either of those things. There is no drug in the world that cures personality disorders like dependence and antisociality/criminality. This is the equivalent of Rebecca taking Xanax for her behavior, since the effects would be almost identical: They'd both be insanely sedating, but that's it. She'd still be doing what she does in the film whether or not she was taking the drug as prescribed, and she'd still be an intelligent, calculating psychopath.I was all hyped up for this film for its premise, but it ends up sucking because of the ""twist"" about Rebecca that makes exactly zero sense of any kind. Maybe if I weren't savvy about psychology and neurology beforehand, I could ignorantly buy into this trash, but it ends up being exploitative and ludicrously stupid. Seriously, Rebecca would never go near a college campus if she had this; she'd be far more likely to be in a criminal institution, not taking some goddamned medication that isn't even for the conditions she displays in the film. Also, if she displayed this kind of grossly criminal behavior before, why did they still send her to a college campus with a roommate and just trust that she'd take her medication, and everything would be fine?Is it me, or is bipolar disorder starting to become synonymous with violent tendencies, despite that being complete and total nonsense? This isn't the first piece of media that displays manic-depression as something identical to criminal violence and lack of impulse control, neither of which is even remotely connected to it. If anything, a manic-depressive, during a fit of major depression, would try to kill themselves, but it has nothing to do with impulse control or violent tendencies. It's weird how even after the fictitious A Beautiful Mind ruined everyone's idea of what schizophrenia is (and still managed to win a best picture Oscar) we're still viewing mental illness as the equivalent of an urge to commit homicide. I guess that's next on our list of things in the future to ""tolerate"".",1,Zyprexa doesn't treat psychopathy.

The film starts with Sara Matthews (Minka Kelly)  arriving at her new university, going to her new room and awaiting the arrival of her new roommate. Sara makes friends quickly with a few party girls and gets invited to a frat party where she catches the eye of Stephen (Cam Gigandet), a frat boy and drummer in a band. When she returns to her room, her roommate Rebecca (Leighton Meester) has arrived. Rebecca appears to be a social misfit and does not seem to want to become friends with anyone other than Sara, who she quickly becomes possessive of and obsessed about. Gradually she begins to harm anyone else in Sara's life who appears to be either getting in the way of Rebecca's friendship with her or upsetting Sara. These include Stephen, who has very quickly become Sara's boyfriend, Sara's party-girl friend Tracy (Alyson Michalka), her gay and somewhat promiscuous fashion mentor, Irene (Danneel Harris), and her lecherous design professor (Billy Zane). Oh, and Cuddles the kitten.Sara starts to become suspicious of Rebecca's behaviour after she meets Rebecca's parents who are concerned about and frightened by Rebecca. More people get hurt and eventually, Sara and Rebecca confront.So the plot is good. The suspense is also good. Yes the film is predictable but it is not too gory, certainly not the least bit difficult to understand, and makes sense for the most part. The acting of the two lead characters, Sara and Rebecca, is also quite good and believable.The bad: the film seems to rush along faster than it makes sense. A little bit more lead in to the roommate's obsession with Sara would be more believable. The other characters are boring and stereotyped; the boyfriend spends most of his time squinting and trying to look cool, the friends Irene and Tracy seem to have nothing to their characters. I liked Billy Zane and would have liked to see a bigger part for him. Even the part where Tracy seduces him to damage his reputation is not believable because the film rushes through that. The portrayal of college life was also completely stereotypical.I agree with another reviewer's statements: If you're looking to kill some time with a fun movie..this is for you! If you are looking for something with substance, depth, originality, plot, and a storyline that keeps you enthralled to the bitter end...keep it moving this isn't your cup of tea!I was just looking to kill time with an ok movie so it achieved that purpose.

Already having the psycho act like a complete douche within the first ten minutes of the film with no development of the friendship is just lazy ass writing by the idiots who wrote this garbage.We can compare a lot to SWF. Instead of adopting a dog, they adopt a cat. Instead of the psycho's sister being dead the lead character's sister is dead. The psycho confronts lead on where she been just like in SWF. Teacher makes the moves on lead character just like what happened to Fonda in SWF, instead of getting a makeover to look like her, she gets the exact same tattoo, and the ultimate scene stealer is the bedroom scene. She dresses up like the girl and goes to ex-boyfriend's room and kills him with a knife instead of a high heel shoe. You barely even hear about this ex-boyfriend in this film. Even the death of psycho is retarded just like in the movie SWF, sharp object to the back.Billy Zane & Aly Michalka's characters just disappear just for the sake of vanishing.

For movies of this genre, I lower my standards. Unfortunately, I should have listened. This was pretty much as bad as described. It was a total rip off of Single White Female, only a lot cheesier. There were a couple of moments that could have been creepy, but something was just a little off. Either it was the acting, or casting, or dialogue... Something made the whole thing just not believeable. I felt like the characters didn't behave very logically. It was hard to believe someone so psychotic would be running around campus. I have had my share of bad roommate experiences in college, but this was just too exagerated. The main character should have paid more attention once the first red flag was waved.

1312609,A2GPN2VKS8E77C,B002ZG99IG,HAMLET,"[0, 0]","Note: I just saw this movie with XFinity On Demand not more than 30 minutes ago.This film is a PG-13 version of Single White Female, which I admit, I have not seen, but the plot is similar, hence the comparison to the film which starred Bridget Fonda (daughter of the late great Academy Award winning actor Henry Fonda) and Jennifer Jason Leigh. The movie just pulls you in from the first frame and never lets you go until the final image fades from the screen. Ms. Kelly and Ms. Meester are really good actresses, in addition to being stunningly beautiful. Same goes for Ms. Michalka (please excuse me if i got her name wrong). I quite enjoyed it. SPOILER ALERTS!!! I wish the love scene which was skilfully intercut with Rebecca posing as Sara while talking to Jason on the phone had included some nudity. Same goes for the shower scene with Tracey. I also wish the movie had included flashbacks of Sara's relationship with Emily, how she died and how both of them get along with their parents. The romance between Sara and Stephen was well-done. The scene where Rebecca murders Jason while having sex with him is remeniscent of a scene from Basic Instinct, which is another movie I have not seen. Very well done. Also, I would have liked to know what the girl outside the diner meant when she looked at Rebecca and said, ""We were never friends."" Why did she say that? This part of the plot was left undeveloped, and it would have been nice to see that fleshed out. SPOILER ALERTS OVER!!! Billy Zane also does a commendable job as the professor. Hypnotic and with its jumpy moments, spiced with some humour. I recommend this movie. (I seriously wish I had a girlfriend like Ms. Kelly; I'm single...and ugly).

But, I like to give things a chance.  Let's just say I'm an idiot.  This movie was SO pointless.  Ok, first the story.  It is about a girl who goes to college.  When she gets to her dorm room she meets her roommate.  The roommate is crazy.  That's it.  That is the entire story.  Then, the nut roommate starts obsessing with the girl who moved in.  Like the girl finds a cat and she can not have them at in their room.  She is going to movie out and take the cat to her friends.  So, the crazy girl kills the cat.  She threatens some people and maybe kills one.  Now, if these seem like they could be interesting, they are not.  One after the other, whatever the girl likes or who ever she starts doing this with, ends up missing or dead or they just stay away from her.  How she could not realize that it is her roommate doing the stuff is beyond me.  There were so many little things that led nowhere.  Just left dangling.  This was not worth the 1.99 red box rental.  It ends the exact way you think it will.Another thing is there were no special features.  I am sure they would have been as meaningless as the movie, but it would have made me feel a little better about renting it.  Then, It is about 11 at night and I am watching it on my PS3.  I kept getting some message that said not verified or able to play the audio lease check out some website for help.  This is the first movie that would not play on my PS3.

Quit frankly, between the girls from Gossip Girl, Hellcats, The Vampire Diaries, and One Tree Hill that makes up 90% of the cast (shows that I happen to love by the way). I mean, Billy Zane is barely in it, and Cam Gigandet is just thrown in for good measure. You know they always have to include the dumb jock/rockstar boyfriend who's just as clueless as the female lead of the movie.

I don't know if anyone else missed it, but he's missing for a nice chunk after they meet in the beginning of the movie.

Sara makes friends, blends in, goes to parties, even dates a relatively normal likable guy who plays in an on campus band. The running joke is that his band can't get a gig off campus. We see so little of the bf and his band that it's hard to form an opinion as to their musical skills. Nothing much happens to Sara's new bf and that's part of the problem here That the main part of the story doesn't seem as interesting as what might have happened between Sara and her new (normal) friends. Sara's roommate, Rebecca goes to great lengths to alienate anyone that Sara has any contact with. This becomes thoroughly predictable to the audience. Sara, an aspiring fashion design major finds that a class she needs is filled. The professor suddenly showers her with praise and then invites her along on a vacation of sorts. A tape of the professor's offer gets sent to the right people just to get him in trouble. Admittedly, it seems that he had it coming. A possible subplot about a college professor romancing students and ending with deadly consequences and we fall back into the same rut with Sara and her roommates. The other characters seemed interesting sometimes, like the professor, and could have become victims in a slasher style picture or maybe more of a ""Carrie"" type thriller.The appeal of this kind of movie to certain audiences is that you can make fun of it while you get drunk or high to. Remember ""Scream"" ?There are a few creepy moments as seen in the previews. Rebecca's pale complexion and blank stare look disturbing enough for Sara's friends to notice that Rebecca is almost always somewhere watching Sara and then disappears when discovered.

1312621,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B002ZG99IG,Mark Turner,"[7, 9]","This could be the shortest review I've ever written. Why? Because this movie was so bad, so boring and has been done so many times in the past all I could think while watching was why make it again?Long story short the film is about a young woman named Sara (Minka Kelly) who arrives at the University of Los Angeles, goes out with friends to a party and meets a new guy. When she gets back she finds her roommate Rebecca (Leighton Meester) moved in. The two become friends as roommates do but Rebecca takes things a little too far.Okay she takes them way far. She's a stereotypical nutcase who obsesses way too much about Sara. She threatens anyone who she thinks is getting too close to her. She goes through her things. She attempts to prevent anyone from getting to near her. Sound familiar? If not then you probably never saw SINGLE WHITE FEMALE or even FATAL ATTRACTION. Both have psycho women who feel compelled to do damage to the ones their attracted to.The worst part of all is that with an attractive cast, all of which are accomplished actors, one would think they'd have a decent script to work with. Instead the film is boring with a capital B. Long drawn out sequences that lead nowhere, scenes that take far too long to pan out and so much filler in the whole film make this one seem like a half hour TV episode stretched out to 91 minutes. Even at that amount of time you feel like the movie takes forever.You've seen this before. You know how it's going to end. Even if you haven't seen the other movies that this film steals from (and poorly at that) you'll know what's going to happen before the final minutes roll. And that is the sign of a badly made film. A remake or a reworking of a story can be made so that its at least entertaining. This film offers nothing like entertainment. I would love to write a longer piece on this film but then why bother?

1312630,A20NJAPECFGIR9,B002ZG99IG,"nina ""Movie Maiden""","[1, 2]","Okay I knew this was gonna be Single White Female before I watched it. But I decided to give it a try just to see if anything was different. NOTHING was different. This was Single White Female all over except with worse actors and a college setting.Here once again we have a horrid remake AKA copy cat film with a bunch of no-name pinup dolls. It might pattern itself after Single White Female but no way does it reach SWF's caliber.SWF is a classic. It is the queen of all female-on-female obsession films if not the first film of that genre. It is one of the most famous movies in cinema history. In the last twenty years many films have tried to capture the genius of SWF only to fall incredibly short.So why the heck do they keep trying?SWF had the wonderful talents of Jennifer Jason Leigh and Bridget Fonda. I wouldn't have a problem with the no-names in The Roommate if they could act but they couldn't. The wacko girl who is supposed to play Jennifer's character lacks any kind of suspense or terror. She was as scary as a kitten. She did nothing that surprised you, nothing that you cared about, nothing frightening. She was the saddest excuse for a villain ever.Minka Kelly who played the lead role was drab and was about as exciting as clipping toenails. She spoke in her scenes like she was reading out of a book. Her range for this type of role just isn't there. She's an okay actress but to play the Bridget part? No. It just didn't work.The boyfriend was useless and unnecessary. He was a horrible actor. He spent his time grinning the entire film even when the scenes weren't supposed to be funny. Maybe that's because he knew how pathetic this movie was. He didn't do a single thing of importance. Either they needed him for the fight at the end of the movie or so they could have that sex scene. Other than those two things I don't see why they needed him. Sarah did not need a boyfriend.I think this film would've been more interesting if the two women had some kind of lesbian thing going on where either they dated or one just became obsessed. In 2012 you'd think the filmmakers would've been more creative. Even Jennifer Jason Leigh had a lesbian vibe when it came to the SWF role back in '92. We see no reason why the Jennifer Jason Leigh wannabe was so obsessed with Sarah (Kelly). Why? What the heck did Sarah do? She barely spent time with the girl and she wasn't so great that someone would be obsessed with her. The wacko girl was the rich one so if anyone would be obsessed with someone it would be Sarah. It just didn't add up.The film was slow and it was sad that they didn't even try to change anything from SWF except just the setting and age of people. I mean this was so similar to Single White Female that if it weren't for the bad acting, I would've thought that was what I was watching.For those who praise this film, you obviously haven't seen decent films of this genre. Do yourself a favor and go see one. This film couldn't kiss Single White Female's feet. Even if you didn't like SWF, it was better than this mess.If filmmakers are gonna continue to recycle older films for the new generation then they need to at least make them good. If you've seen any decent suspense film then you couldn't find this anything other than mediocre or nerve-cringing horrible.Note to Hollywood: Stop copying hits and stop doing remakes and making them worse!!!Oh and did I mention that Billy Zane is in this? Yeah. Billy Zane. Seriously?

But the Blu is a mix of Sony & Screen Gems trying to make something out of nothing, and they both succeed and fail.The story follows our all-pretty-to-look-at college girls and boys as they go to school to be stalked, take showers, party and get killed - but all in a PG-13 way. The Blu clarity is excellent, even with super light backgrounds and dark clothing, even with dark showers and even with a kitten in a dryer. The sound has a nice DTS mix to it (will list that later) but the supplements were somewhat miserable:* Deleted & alternate scenes, 5 @ 6:09 minutes. This opening was boring (their empty dorm room and furniture), glad to see it cut. They cut out a lot of the Irene/Rebecca stuff which would have made more sense to have in the movie.* Making of, 8:45 minutes. Clip heavy, talking head piece but will give the fans more of their eye candy to look at - even more so in this next fluff;* Next Gen of Stars, 5:25 minutes. The entire piece is a self-congratulatory set of cuts gratuitously made from the prior interviews...yuck.* Dressing dangerously, 3:47 minutes. A quip about the fashion on the set.* Director's commentary. For what he has to say about the film I would say stick with the two interview supplements - as painful as that is to say.* movieIQ. Definitely for the fans of these stars in case you are low on your eye candy trivia.What gives this one more star above the one for film and one for Blu clarity, is the amount of work put into the sound sets; 5.1 DTS for English, Portuguese, and French with 5.1 on the Spanish, but also a rare 5.1 on the DVS. Subs in same with commentary subs also - so kudos to them for getting everything subbed.

Had they gone for an R version and did a little editing and re-write it could have been a cult classic in spite of the predictability. Regardless of the negative reviews, I enjoyed the film because I enjoyed the characters.Minka Kelly plays Sara Matthews, a girl from Des Moines, Iowa. She is studying fashion at a liberal arts college in LA. Rebecca (Leighton Meester) is her roommate. She is a rich local girl, a clothes whore who does not party. Alyson Michalka plays the floozy friend. Like Daniel Radcliffe, Alyson has been able to go her entire career without changing her hair-do. Near the beginning we are teased as a drunk Alyson removes her top for the Frat boys. They cheer and all we get to see is her back.Early on we get the impression (odious music, glares) Rebecca is possessive of Sara's attention/friendship in an unhealthy way. Sara's sister Emily died when she was 9 years old. She carries the memory of her in the form a tattoo over her heart. Rebecca not only dislikes tattoos, but in an interesting scene, we find out she doesn't have pierced ears. Very unusual for a college girl. Sara had given Rebecca some earrings to wear, who then uses the earrings to pierce her ears so as not to disappoint her new BFF. Big time facial close-ups for Leighton Meester. Like most movie psychos, Rebecca is cold and calculating.My main criticism of the movie is that it shows too much of Rebecca doing bad things. Rather the movie should show us the result of what has happened and let the audience try to figure out if Rebecca is lying or not. For instance in one scene Rebecca beats herself up and blames someone else. They should have never have shown Rebecca beating herself up. There is a lot of action at the end of the film which should have been spread out. The movie is its own plot spoiler.No nudity, Underage drinking, PG-13 sex scene, and it gave my cat nightmares.",4,CUDDLES IS AN EVIL KITTY,1341360000,"07 4, 2012",2012,1910,"['PG-13', 'version', 'SWF', 'Had', 'gone', 'R', 'version', 'did', 'little', 'editing', 're-write', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cult', 'classic', 'spite', 'predictability', 'Regardless', 'negative', 'reviews', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'enjoyed', 'characters.Minka', 'Kelly', 'Sara', 'Matthews', 'girl', 'Des', 'Moines', 'Iowa', 'studying', 'fashion', 'liberal', 'arts', 'college', 'LA', 'Rebecca', 'Leighton', 'Meester', 'roommate', 'rich', 'local', 'girl', 'clothes', 'who', 'not', 'party', 'Alyson', 'Michalka', 'floozy', 'friend', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'Alyson', 'been', 'able', 'go', 'entire', 'career', 'changing', 'hair-do', 'beginning', 'are', 'teased', 'drunk', 'Alyson', 'top', 'Frat', 'boys', 'cheer', 'get', 'see', 'back.Early', 'get', 'impression', 'odious', 'music', 'glares', 'Rebecca', 'possessive', 'Sara', 'attention/friendship', 'unhealthy', 'way', 'Sara', 'sister', 'Emily', 'died', 'when', 'was', '9', 'years', 'old', 'memory', 'form', 'tattoo', 'heart', 'Rebecca', 'not', 'only', 'tattoos', 'interesting', 'scene', 'find', 'out', ""n't"", 'have', 'pierced', 'ears', 'Very', 'unusual', 'college', 'girl', 'Sara', 'had', 'given', 'Rebecca', 'earrings', 'wear', 'who', 'then', 'earrings', 'pierce', 'ears', 'so', 'not', 'disappoint', 'new', 'BFF', 'Big', 'time', 'facial', 'close-ups', 'Leighton', 'Meester', 'most', 'movie', 'psychos', 'Rebecca', 'cold', 'calculating.My', 'main', 'criticism', 'movie', 'too', 'much', 'Rebecca', 'doing', 'bad', 'things', 'movie', 'should', 'show', 'result', 'what', 'happened', 'let', 'audience', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'Rebecca', 'lying', 'not', 'instance', 'one', 'scene', 'Rebecca', 'up', 'someone', 'else', 'should', 'have', 'never', 'have', 'shown', 'Rebecca', 'beating', 'up', 'lot', 'action', 'end', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'spread', 'out', 'movie', 'own', 'plot', 'spoiler.No', 'nudity', 'Underage', 'drinking', 'PG-13', 'sex', 'scene', 'gave', 'cat', 'nightmares']",N/A

When Sara starts to do things without Rebecca strange things begin to happen.  Let me first start by saying that this is not a bad movie, but it is definatly geared toward a specific age group, and it's not mine.  For the 19-20 year olds this will be very creepy.  For the older crowd this is a definate remake of ""Single White Female"", but in my opinion not as good.  For those who have not seen that movie this will be very creepy.  For those that have seen that movie you will notice the very simaler scenes and ideas.  Again this is actually not a bad movie, but if I was 10 years younger and a girl this would really scare me.  If you are older like me and want to be creeped out by a movie like this one, I'd stick with the original ""Single White Female"".  I will say the Leighton Meester, in a departure from her usual roles, did a really great job of playing a creepy stalker.  I just could not really get in to this movie.  I give it a B-.Would I watch again? - I don't think I would, but it made me want to watch ""Single White Female"" again.*Also Try - Kalamity & Single White Female",3,"A college girl version of ""Single White Female"".

Sara has some new people in her life, things to see, fashions to produce. The only thing that seems to be standing adversely to that is the possessiveness she just starts to notice.In the vein of many a stalking movie, The Roommate makes its debut and has some hits and some misses. The good thing about the movie is that it has some really nice moments where it seems creepy. The roomate does a nice job being creepy and seemingly feared, and the moments seem to creep up and present themselves. From the small reflection of someone wathcing across the way to the moments when fear seems to carry a sharp utensil, there are times when the movie has fun. Sadly, some things detract from that.One thing in modern movies is the fact that the people seem a little fake. From the coffee houses to the party scene, the people seem like a Gap add. They dress a specific way and look a specifc type and the diversity that life offers seems to stay outside. You also have to buy into the notion that college rooms are big, and that is a hard one for anybody who has seen a dorm. Add to that the arrangements of some of the moments and the spacing and you might be a little wary. Still, these are problems with A LOt of new venues.If you like this genre offshoot then you will like this. If you do not, then this might not be for you. It is not bloody, does not have nudity in any form, and does not really offer a bleak looking canvas. some of it is mind and mind alone, and the images are left to the watcher. Some like that, however, and I like it enough. I would have given it a 3.5 or so, and the 4 it rounds to seems good. I am glad I saw it, but it would not have hurt to miss it.I suppose it depends on the person.Thank you.",4,"Who created fashion?
