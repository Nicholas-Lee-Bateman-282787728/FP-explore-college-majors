Why can't this brilliant and moving mini-series not be purchased new?! The arrogance of small-minded politicians that destroyed this incredible machine is breathtaking. An engineering masterpiece that had amazing potential, the Avro Arrow has become a symbol for the flat-earth, know-nothing, anti-technology, anti-aerospace mindset that pervades those who control the pursestrings of government aerospace projects around the world.Is history about to repeat itself with America's manned space program? Is the Obama Administration about to DESTROY America's manned space efforts, as Bush Jr. nearly did, ensuring America does not return to the Moon for the forseeable future and NEVER makes it to Mars?! All because lies damned LIES are being told about the costs and technical difficulties of such projects? 'The Arrow' has become a symbol of what is wrong, especially today, with the lack of boldness in this world. Watch this fine mini-series and get angry, VERY angry that this is ALL might be about to happen again on a grander scale: AVRO Canada and its support companies lost nearly 50,000 jobs after the Arrow was cancelled. Today, far more than 100,000 people with irreplaceable skills face a similar fate with Project 'Constellation'.

I know that when Dan Ackroyd was very active at Canada Day celebrations and was really good to the people (did not hid away).  A good deal of the buildings are still around, and they allowed people to see the plywood version of the airplane they made up for the film (it looked like metal to me).  Almost a documentary told with literary license.  Even this summer the Military set a boat out to try to find more of the proto-type models at the bottom of ... one of the Great Lakes (don't recall which).The total distruction of the program is tough to take or understand.  Almost overnight, they film hints at political hate as a motivator, the planes were totally dismantled and distroyed; all blueprints and engineering documents &quot;distroyed&quot;. It was not enough to order the the planes distroyed, but the were immediately torn to pieces; so it would be as if they never existed, or could be revived in the future.  Ironic considering England, I believe the film said, had offered to pay for the plans as they wanted to take over the project; or add it to their own program.Very appropriate today; as the &quot;brain drain&quot; to the USA continues, and as the program points out, the Canadian Engineers largely ended up going to the States to make what would become NASA their new employer.Every Canadian should be made aware of this historic episode from the 50s.",4,Another Great Canadian Story Relatively Unknown.,1093651200,"08 28, 2004",2004,1516,"['movie', 'was', 'largely', 'shot', 'Winnipeg', 'Canadian', 'cast', 'returning', 'USA', 'make', 'picture', 'basically', 'donated', 'salaries', 'know', 'when', 'Dan', 'Ackroyd', 'was', 'very', 'active', 'Canada', 'Day', 'celebrations', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'people', 'did', 'not', 'hid', 'away', 'good', 'deal', 'buildings', 'are', 'still', 'allowed', 'people', 'see', 'plywood', 'version', 'airplane', 'made', 'up', 'film', 'looked', 'metal', 'documentary', 'told', 'literary', 'license', 'Even', 'summer', 'Military', 'set', 'boat', 'try', 'find', 'more', 'proto-type', 'models', 'bottom', 'one', 'Great', 'Lakes', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', '.The', 'total', 'distruction', 'program', 'tough', 'take', 'understand', 'Almost', 'overnight', 'film', 'hints', 'political', 'hate', 'motivator', 'planes', 'were', 'totally', 'dismantled', 'distroyed', 'blueprints', 'engineering', 'documents', 'quot', 'distroyed', 'quot', 'was', 'not', 'enough', 'order', 'planes', 'distroyed', 'were', 'immediately', 'torn', 'pieces', 'would', 'be', 'never', 'existed', 'could', 'be', 'revived', 'future', 'Ironic', 'considering', 'England', 'believe', 'film', 'said', 'had', 'offered', 'pay', 'plans', 'wanted', 'take', 'over', 'project', 'add', 'own', 'program.Very', 'appropriate', 'today', 'quot', 'brain', 'drain', 'quot', 'USA', 'program', 'points', 'out', 'Canadian', 'Engineers', 'largely', 'ended', 'up', 'going', 'States', 'make', 'what', 'would', 'become', 'NASA', 'new', 'employer.Every', 'Canadian', 'should', 'be', 'made', 'aware', 'historic', 'episode', '50s']",N/A

The AVRO Arrow story is of passion, mystery and mostly political betrayal. The film hints that in someway the American Government had a hand in its failure, but to the contrary, the USAF was more than willing to help the RCAF to get the fighter-interceptor off the ground, as the weapon system would have been American, and even offered to purchase some of the aircraft and to give it back to the RCAF, these facts are mostly unknown, however they are mentioned with clear evidence in the extensive special features of the DVD. Furthermore the British wanted a couple of the aircraft to under go further testing in England, but by this time the idiotic Diefenbaker led Canadian Government had the all the flying examples chopped into pieces. Thus no one ever fund out the true potential of this superb aircraft!While this DVD is no longer made if you can find a copy at a good price, like I did for $5.00 at my local Walmart, it is a worthwhile investment if you enjoy history aviation history.",5,The Arrow -- the plane that could have been,1237852800,"03 24, 2009",2009,1121,"['very', 'accurate', 'excellent', 'production', 'scene', 'story', 'aircraft', 'was', 'years', 'head', 'time', '1958', 'AVRO', 'Arrow', 'story', 'passion', 'mystery', 'mostly', 'political', 'betrayal', 'film', 'hints', 'someway', 'American', 'Government', 'had', 'hand', 'failure', 'contrary', 'USAF', 'was', 'more', 'willing', 'help', 'RCAF', 'get', 'fighter-interceptor', 'ground', 'weapon', 'system', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'American', 'even', 'offered', 'purchase', 'aircraft', 'give', 'back', 'RCAF', 'facts', 'are', 'mostly', 'unknown', 'however', 'are', 'mentioned', 'clear', 'evidence', 'extensive', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'British', 'wanted', 'couple', 'aircraft', 'go', 'further', 'testing', 'England', 'time', 'idiotic', 'Diefenbaker', 'led', 'Canadian', 'Government', 'had', 'flying', 'examples', 'chopped', 'pieces', 'Thus', 'one', 'ever', 'out', 'true', 'potential', 'superb', 'aircraft', 'DVD', 'no', 'longer', 'made', 'can', 'find', 'copy', 'good', 'price', 'did', '5.00', 'local', 'Walmart', 'worthwhile', 'investment', 'enjoy', 'history', 'aviation', 'history']",N/A

As my father explained to my Mother & I we would never hear or observe any of the Avro Arrows flying again. I looked at my Dad's sullen expression on his face asking:"" But,Why Dad ""? We in our area all had friends & relatives working at Avro Aircraft,Canada.We were always at the ready for that phone call from Dad as he would say;"" Their flying her today at such & such time "". Outside we would scramble looking into the N/W, friends, relatives, all walks of life would cease work around us. I guess a lot of people used the people looking N/W as an indicator of a flight as even people such as Police Officers, etc, would find an excuse to stop & ask. There she'd be thundering out with everyone hoping she would make a standard left hand turn out banking & climbing into a 180 degree reciprocal course. In a some cases the A/C would turn left base for a buzz job down runway#32. Of course if she took off on runway#14 we were all in for a treat, a spectacle I shall never forget ever but with sadness. This movie of course has a few fictionalized parts BUT it mostly tells the truth as it was. One of my best friends & mentor dealing with flying worked for Avro. Sad to say he said RL206 was also scrapped but was it? Like a lot of others I know a lot of us really wish she did escape as portrayed in the movie,BUT? It's strange, even before my friend passed on I was talking to him two days before his death. The Arrow topic came up, I still feel he wanted to tell me something but maybe it was just my imagination? This movie is great, at least it's portraying a great A/C & a dream that should have blossomed into full bloom. Just like in the movie I remember watching the Arrow screaming upward in a vertical climb, lighting the after-burners & a few seconds later the BOOM as she broke the sound barrier! This movie is well worth the price just for the interviews with the real people who worked for Avro during the Arrow project. It really would have been great if Jack Woodman did indeed steal RL206 early that morning presenting the U.S.A. with a gift but I know I & our whole neighborhood would have awoken as we were located just a bit S/E of Malton Airport BUT I still wish! DEFINITELY FIVE STARS & A WORTHWHILE INVESTMENT but a sad reminder of a Government's biggest blunder ! Strange but even on my Dad's death bed we got talking about the Avro Arrow. He just rolled his eyes, shook his head side to side disgustingly & muttered an expletive but he did watch the mini series on TV when it aired enjoying it with full recommendations for all to watch.",5,"""BugSmasher""",1346976000,"09 7, 2012",2012,2741,"['mentioned', 'review', 'book', 'AVRO', 'AIRCRAFT', 'COLD', 'WAR', 'AVIATION', 'Randall', 'Whitcomb', 'Black', 'Friday', 'February', '20th,1959', 'will', 'be', 'forever', 'locked', 'memory', 'mind', 'father', 'explained', 'Mother', 'would', 'never', 'hear', 'observe', 'Avro', 'Arrows', 'flying', 'again', 'looked', 'Dad', 'sullen', 'expression', 'face', 'asking', 'Why', 'Dad', 'area', 'had', 'friends', 'relatives', 'working', 'Avro', 'Aircraft', 'Canada.We', 'were', 'always', 'ready', 'phone', 'call', 'Dad', 'would', 'say', 'flying', 'today', 'such', 'such', 'time', 'would', 'scramble', 'looking', 'N/W', 'relatives', 'walks', 'life', 'would', 'cease', 'work', 'guess', 'lot', 'people', 'used', 'people', 'looking', 'N/W', 'indicator', 'flight', 'even', 'people', 'such', 'Police', 'Officers', 'etc', 'would', 'find', 'excuse', 'stop', 'ask', ""'d"", 'be', 'thundering', 'out', 'everyone', 'hoping', 'would', 'make', 'standard', 'left', 'hand', 'turn', 'out', 'banking', 'climbing', '180', 'degree', 'reciprocal', 'course', 'cases', 'A/C', 'would', 'turn', 'left', 'base', 'buzz', 'job', 'down', 'runway', '32', 'course', 'took', 'off', 'runway', '14', 'were', 'treat', 'spectacle', 'shall', 'never', 'forget', 'ever', 'sadness', 'movie', 'course', 'few', 'fictionalized', 'parts', 'mostly', 'truth', 'was', 'One', 'best', 'friends', 'mentor', 'dealing', 'flying', 'worked', 'Avro', 'Sad', 'say', 'said', 'RL206', 'was', 'also', 'scrapped', 'was', 'lot', 'others', 'know', 'lot', 'really', 'wish', 'did', 'escape', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'BUT', 'strange', 'even', 'friend', 'passed', 'was', 'talking', 'two', 'days', 'death', 'Arrow', 'topic', 'came', 'up', 'still', 'feel', 'wanted', 'tell', 'something', 'maybe', 'was', 'just', 'imagination', 'movie', 'great', 'least', 'portraying', 'great', 'A/C', 'dream', 'should', 'have', 'blossomed', 'full', 'bloom', 'Just', 'movie', 'remember', 'watching', 'Arrow', 'screaming', 'upward', 'vertical', 'climb', 'lighting', 'after-burners', 'few', 'seconds', 'later', 'BOOM', 'broke', 'sound', 'barrier', 'movie', 'well', 'price', 'just', 'interviews', 'real', 'people', 'who', 'worked', 'Avro', 'Arrow', 'project', 'really', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'Jack', 'Woodman', 'did', 'indeed', 'steal', 'RL206', 'early', 'morning', 'presenting', 'U.S.A.', 'gift', 'know', 'whole', 'neighborhood', 'would', 'have', 'awoken', 'were', 'located', 'just', 'bit', 'S/E', 'Malton', 'Airport', 'BUT', 'still', 'wish', 'DEFINITELY', 'FIVE', 'STARS', 'A', 'WORTHWHILE', 'INVESTMENT', 'sad', 'reminder', 'Government', 'biggest', 'blunder', 'Strange', 'even', 'Dad', 'death', 'bed', 'got', 'talking', 'Avro', 'Arrow', 'just', 'rolled', 'eyes', 'shook', 'head', 'side', 'side', 'disgustingly', 'muttered', 'expletive', 'did', 'watch', 'mini', 'series', 'TV', 'when', 'aired', 'enjoying', 'full', 'recommendations', 'watch']",N/A
699730,A384MT68QQGNJ7,B000065ILG,Sean Curtin,"[0, 0]","After watching this movie I had tears welling in my eyes.  I'd always wondered about the Canadian built Arrow and there's a lot of great information not just in this movie adaptation of the story but also in the accompanying documentaries.  This is one of the best DVD's I have ever purchased.  The special features and even DVD-ROM material make this one of the most special aviation movies you could possibly own for your collection.The story is 50% made up with some characters varied so as not to slight the names of some individuals but to be honest the individuals and the stupid prime minister of Canada at the time responsible for it's demise should have been taken out and shot at dawn.  This was a remarkable aircraft and without doubt the precursor to the Concord and the Tu-144.  There are not many aircraft that could reach Mach 2.8 and considering this was 1959 it's simply an astonishing achievment and everyone involved in it's design, development and construction should have received medals and accolades beyond imagining.Dan Akyroyd delivers a brilliant performance and in fact I found all of the actors in this production delivered a magnificient array of performances.Seriously this movie stands right up there with movies like 'The Right Stuff' and 'Those Magnificient Men In There Flying Machines' as one of the greatest aviation movies ever made.This story deserved to be told and even with the artistic license, hits the nail straight on the head.What was even more remarkable was the terrific accompanying documentaries and support material.  Look you'll have to buy this one to believe it, it's sensational value especially for that price.  I will be there if they ever decide to bring this out on Bluray as I was literally tongue tied.Ultimately, this is an aircraft just like the TSR2(a movie like this one would be a worthwhile production to reveal the beauty of the British built TSR2).  The arrow however could possibly have been even better.  Both of these aircraft featured tragic destruction orders that prevented them from ever becoming production aircraft.  In 'The Arrow's' case, it's even more tragic as they had built a lot of aircraft when the terrible order to destroy everything was given.I'll be keeping an eye out on ebay for any scrap of information, surviving blueprints or anything as it's a seriously magnificient looking and performing flying machine.  Well ahead of it's time and beat every country with it's very impressive specs.To think that years later we have aircraft that can't even exceed Mach 1.5? The Arrow could exceed Mach 1.9 and had the new engines been completed they were predicting Mach 2.7. Recently Australia retired it's fleet of F111's(top speed of Mach 2.5 listed but I have it first hand that it could break Mach 2.6 without any problems) for the inferior Super Hornet's which can't even break Mach 1.6.  Why do great aircraft like THE ARROW get put aside for aircraft with lower specs?  Your guess is as good as mine.The Arrow truly was a beautiful aircraft and this has to go down as one of the greatest tragedies of the last century.  The potential and advancement to aviation technology and development from this program, not to mention the jobs it created that were lost are simply a complete shame and atrocity of the Canadian government at that time.Sean A. CurtinAircraft Maintenance EngineerPS. Be sure to read the information about what the government purchased at the end of the film, it's funny but when considering what was lost, maddening.  Proof again that crazy politicians are a menace to the advancement of aviation technology. Imagine a government that doesn't back it's own countries industries???  (I guess that's countries all over the world for various political reasons but this one would have delivered a national pride and prestige which even the stories of amaze people to this day).",5,"Simply stunning.

Inspired to find out more, I searched for written references, ...and naturally, the story is even more fascinating than what the short span of a film can portay!A sad realizatrion of WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN, this is a narrative of the considerable efforts of a brilliant team of Canadian aerospace engineers, scientists, and all the highly-skilled technicians that assembled this aircraft. They were betrayed by the rash and irrational whim of a very foolish politician. He SCRAPPED not only the program, ...but ALL the aircraft! ...Even when the U.S. Air Force expressed interest in purchasing ALL the completed aircraft, and the remaining components, it was all destroyed!In the early years of the Cold War, Avro Canada broke new ground in aviation technology. Much of the common technology of modern jet-fighter aircraft and spacecraft, which we take for granted today, can trace its origin to the Arrow project. With this one aircraft, the potential for Canada dominating the field of advanced aviation was almost certainly guaranteed. Think of all the possibilities for not only the technological benefit, but the economic advantages, on all levels! This could very well have been a major ""kicking-in of the door"", so to speak, for the industrial advancemnet of Canada.This story gives us yet another example of the very significant contributions of Canada, in all its unsung glory!Imagine if the Cold War had gone ""hot"":From an American perspective, Canada was holding a significant shield for the United States. A Soviet missile strike would be intercepted by the combined efforts of the U.S. and Canadian Air-Forces, guarding the entire Arctic Sea coast.

I really liked this Film, when it first emerged, as it is a real accurate close up look at a time in Canadian History, that is very significant to our present standings as the preeminent Scientific community and so on: This very nicely, shows quite dramatically possibly, admittedly, this country's relations with our US Military counterparts, and then the reasons, we as a Nation finally went out on our own, to develop our own specialized Military hardware etc; It is a very nice retro kinda deal, showing a far better time, back in the late 50's etc, when We as a Nation really began to emerge!

It was hard then to take Dan Akroyd seriously just like it's hard now to take Leslie Nielsen seriously when you watch Forbidden Planet but Akroyd did a good job and the story is fascinating. I had a VHS copy of the movie but somehow it has deteriorated so I ordered the DVD.  It's quality is good but not great.  It is, however, good enough for me to enjoy a one of a kind movie.
