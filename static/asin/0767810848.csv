10125,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,0767810848,Acute Observer,"[1, 21]","The Freshman, 1990 filmThe film begins with a large egg that hatches a lizard. [Symbolism?] We see a man with a rifle shooting to drive another hunter from the woods. A young man will become a freshman at the NY University film school. He arrives at Grand Central Station. [""Do not talk to strangers no matter how friendly they appear.""] Clark Kellogg is a victim. Will he cooperate with the thief? A good paying job? Clark meets Uncle Carmine. Clark will drive to the airport, pick up a package, then drive to New Jersey. They agree. Later Clark visits an expensive house in Queens as sees a picture of the Mona Lisa. Talk fills out this comedy. Clark and his friend go to pick up the package - a Komodo Dragon lizard! Will their package become upset? What if it gets loose? Will people panic in the mall? They deliver the leaping lizard.Clark calls home to talk to his Mom. Does he talk too much? Transporting endangered animals? Will Clark marry Tina? An offer he can't refuse? There is a chase through lower Manhattan. Clark was chosen. Next a gun permit! The Department of Justice wants to talk to Clark. The Gourmet Club feasts on endangered species. They offer him a deal: inform or get two years in Leavenworth. Carmine visits Clark in his dormitory and they talk. Tina calls Clark from class to a skating rink. Is Clark being used? The Gourmet Club has a feast at an isolated spot. Federal Agents raid the place! """"You're a hero."" Will there be a surprise ending? Yes! ""Scam"" is an ugly word, its just business. So there is a happy ending. ""He's like a genius."" And so it ends.This would be a better comedy if it had a better story. Its like something put together by novice movie students who have a really big budget, but couldn't choose between drama and comedy and failed to do either.

10127,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0767810848,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","It doesn't hit every mark quite as perfectly as the last, but overall `The Freshman' has enough to make you take a second and third look.  The best thing this film has going for it is a great performance by Marlon Brando and the youthful charisma of Matthew Broderick (it was like the 90's ended and his talent flat-lined).  The film, above all else, is very watchable and entertaining, which validates owning and rewatching since it does the trick every time.The film tells the story of Clark Kellogg (like the breakfast cereal) who happens to run into a Mafioso by the name of Carmine Sabatani while attending film school in New York.  Carmine was the inspiration for the character of Vito Corleone in The Godfather films, and this gag is played up with perfect execution by Marlon Brando in full on Corleone getup.  There is no hiding this reincarnation, but what is amazing is that Brando finds layers of sharp humor that create a whole new character inside of a previously rendered one.  So, Kellogg begins working for Sabatani, which gets his hands dirty with some illegal activities; mostly involving a Komodo Dragon.  As the film draws in towards the end, chaos comes knocking at the door with some outlandish sequences (that dinner party scene is brilliant) that mark the film's funnier moments.  The film does have some dry spots throughout (it isn't as `in your face' as some cheaper comedies today) but it makes the most of the humor it has (that mall scene is just priceless) and that makes this a memorable and lasting comedy.It isn't one that will fade from your memory anytime soon.That is the great thing about `The Freshman'; it's memorable.  Everyone that I know who has seen it kind of loves it and they talk about it with endearment.  Sadly, not many people have seen it (there are barely over 30 reviews of the film on this site).  More people need to see this movie.  Sure, it isn't perfect but it registers sharper than most of the comedic garbage churned out by Hollywood today.  The script is tightly woven, the performances are uniformly great (seriously, Brando is LEGEND here) and the payoff is well worth the price of admission!",4,Whoever thought `The Godfather' was a comedy...,1314662400,"08 30, 2011",2011,2158,"[""n't"", 'hit', 'mark', 'quite', 'as', 'perfectly', 'last', 'overall', 'Freshman', 'enough', 'make', 'take', 'second', 'third', 'look', 'best', 'thing', 'film', 'going', 'great', 'performance', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'youthful', 'charisma', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'was', '90', 'ended', 'talent', 'flat-lined', 'film', 'else', 'very', 'watchable', 'entertaining', 'owning', 'rewatching', 'trick', 'time.The', 'film', 'story', 'Clark', 'Kellogg', 'breakfast', 'cereal', 'who', 'run', 'Mafioso', 'name', 'Carmine', 'Sabatani', 'attending', 'film', 'school', 'New', 'York', 'Carmine', 'was', 'inspiration', 'character', 'Vito', 'Corleone', 'Godfather', 'films', 'gag', 'played', 'up', 'perfect', 'execution', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'full', 'Corleone', 'getup', 'hiding', 'reincarnation', 'what', 'amazing', 'Brando', 'layers', 'sharp', 'humor', 'create', 'whole', 'new', 'character', 'previously', 'rendered', 'one', 'So', 'Kellogg', 'working', 'Sabatani', 'hands', 'dirty', 'illegal', 'activities', 'mostly', 'involving', 'Komodo', 'Dragon', 'film', 'draws', 'towards', 'end', 'chaos', 'knocking', 'door', 'outlandish', 'sequences', 'dinner', 'party', 'scene', 'brilliant', 'mark', 'film', 'funnier', 'moments', 'film', 'have', 'dry', 'spots', ""n't"", 'face', 'cheaper', 'comedies', 'today', 'most', 'humor', 'scene', 'just', 'priceless', 'memorable', 'lasting', 'comedy.It', ""n't"", 'one', 'will', 'fade', 'memory', 'anytime', 'soon.That', 'great', 'thing', 'Freshman', 'memorable', 'Everyone', 'know', 'who', 'seen', 'kind', 'loves', 'talk', 'endearment', 'Sadly', 'not', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'seen', 'are', 'barely', '30', 'reviews', 'film', 'site', 'More', 'people', 'need', 'see', 'movie', 'Sure', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'sharper', 'most', 'comedic', 'garbage', 'churned', 'out', 'Hollywood', 'today', 'script', 'tightly', 'woven', 'performances', 'are', 'uniformly', 'great', 'seriously', 'Brando', 'LEGEND', 'here', 'payoff', 'well', 'price', 'admission']",N/A

Then you can see from the description ring that one side is for full screen format and the other side is for windscreen format.This movie is fun from the beginning. Clark Kellogg (Matthew Broderick) narrates the background story. And is the focus of the movie. Clark is going to New York to film school. Upon arrival he loses his luggage in 19 minutes and 11 seconds. I will not go through the detail, as it is more fun to be surprised. However etch scene is so funny that you forget the different layers and depth of the story.The music alone would be worth the movie: ""From Here to Eternity"", ""I Wanna Be Around"", ""Mona Lisa"", ""New York, New York"", ""Shuffle Off To Buffalo"", ""String Quartet No. 13 in a Minor"", ""There She is, Miss America"", ""Guantanamera"", ""Heart and Soul"", ""Introit: Viri Galilaei"", ""Maggie's Farm"", ""Parlami D'Amore Mariu"", ""Straight Outta Compton"", ""Tequila""There are a few highlights for just about everyone.

10132,A95SF04RX9G8,0767810848,"Christopher Moyer ""moyer.privatjokr.com""","[5, 11]","The Freshman is probably best known for Marlon Brando doing a parody of his legendary Godfather character. While in itself, this performance is pretty funny, the film in which it occurs is fairly forgettable, and ultimately a letdown.Matthew Broderick stars as Clark Kellogg, a freshman at NYU film school who gets fleeced of all his belongings before he even sets foot on campus. The perpetrator is Victor Ray (Bruno Kirby) who, when Clark catches up with him, sets him up with a job working for Vic's uncle, Carmine Sabatini (Brando), who Clark immediately notices bears an uncanny resemblance to Don Corleone. Clark's job, for which he will be compensated $500, is to transport some unidentified cargo from JFK Airport to Cherry Hill, NJ.Clark is more than a little surprised when he finds out that the cargo he is to move is, in fact, a Komodo dragon. He decides that this job is not for him, and wants to get out, but Carmine has taken quite a liking to this kid, so much so that he insists Clark marry his only daughter, Tina (Penelope Ann Miller). Clark is confused by the whole situation, and even moreso when federal agents need his help in their investigation of Carmine's use of these endangered species. As it turns out, more than one party involved in this fiasco are not revealing all the cards they have been dealt.The Freshman is a harmless film, intended simply to make you laugh. And there are a few laughs to be had here, but not nearly as many as would be expected. A lot of the jokes fall flat, such as how everybody seems to think Clark is from a different state in the Midwest. Throughout the film, I found myself just waiting for something better to happen, and it never really did.

Spoofing (or should I say poking fun at) 'The Godfather', The Freshman allows Marlon Brando to reprise his oscar winning role, channeling Vito Corleone in Mafioso Carmine Sabatini.  Instead of allowing the audience to make the comparison themselves they immediatly make it for you aknowledging that Carmine was the inspiration for the central charactor in the Godfather films.  This film follows Matthew Broderick who plays Clark Kellog (like the breakfast cereal) as he attends NY Film School.  He inadvertantly meets and ends up employed by Carmine, which leads to his involvment in illegal activities that endanger his life and the life of a Kamodo Dragon (hilarious, believe me).  The film, instead of bombarding you with laugh after laugh, has it's slow spots, but when the laughs come (most involving the lizard) they come hard and they are well worth the weight (the whole mall scene is worth the whole film).

A second viewing a few years later brought home to me just how original and endearing The Freshman really is. Sadly overlooked on its release, this is a movie that works on many levels. Its outrageous plot manages to combine parody, Hitchcockian twists, sparkling dialogue and, at times, touching scenes of affection, in one superbly balanced package. Its achievement is all the more astonishing when one recalls that this was the directorial debut of its talented writer/director, Andrew Bergman.The cast is brilliant. Seasoned pros such as Bruno Kirby and Maximilian Schell (the latter enjoying himself immensely as the gaily enigmatic Larry London) lend wonderful support to the two leads, Matthew Broderick and Marlon Brando. Broderick is ideally cast as the young college student embroiled in the affairs of the Sabatini ""clan"", while Brando gives one of his most likeable performances as the ageing ""don"" who bears more than a passing resemblance to you-know-who. On paper at least, the very notion of Brando sending up his most famous role must have seemed a risky move, but the great Marlon effortlessly avoids any opportunities for tastelessness.

Komodo dragons are not funny, even though their pace is rather wobbly like most lizards.  They are quite dangerous creatures whose mouths are full of deadly bacteria.  They feed on rotting carcases and they don't have to wait until an animal dies of old age or disease.  One bite from their infected jaws is enough to cause sepsis and death.  All the komodos have to do is wait until their victim dies and rots in the Bornean sun a couple of days.  I wonder if the actors in this movie knew they were playing with death.Much acclaim has been given to Brando by other writers here.  I could understand no more than half of his pathetic mumblings.  No wonder Brando bad mouthed this movie after he made it.  He bad mouthed his lines when he was making it.  Those people who thought this movie was worth seeing several times because each time more could be got from it were evidently referring to their progressively better skills at interpreting Brando's gurglings -- or perhaps they were reading his lips (not likely, since he seldom moved them).After seeing Ferris Buehler, I was very disappointed with Matthew Broderick's role in this show.  He just was not funny.  His situation was scary as he became an unwilling member of the mob.The story was incredible (this means unbelievable for those who think everything is either awesome, fabulous, or incredible).  What rich people would pay upward of $250,000 to eat a komodo dragon or any other endangered species?  This is supposed to be the business godfather Brando is supposed to be in -- selling illegal meat to rich dunces -- and what they get for their money is turkey instead of dragon.  I suppose there is some humor is bamboozled rich turkeys acting like cannibals.Rent this dud for something different, but you won't want to see it again.",2,Edgy nightmare,1353196800,"11 18, 2012",2012,1961,"['Warning', 'bits', 'following', 'may', 'give', 'away', 'plot.Those', 'who', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'funny', 'must', 'be', 'same', 'group', 'who', 'think', 'modern', 'TV', 'comedy', 'funny', 'Komodo', 'dragons', 'are', 'not', 'funny', 'even', 'pace', 'rather', 'wobbly', 'most', 'lizards', 'are', 'quite', 'dangerous', 'creatures', 'mouths', 'are', 'full', 'deadly', 'bacteria', 'feed', 'rotting', 'carcases', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'wait', 'animal', 'dies', 'old', 'age', 'disease', 'One', 'bite', 'infected', 'jaws', 'enough', 'cause', 'sepsis', 'death', 'komodos', 'have', 'do', 'wait', 'victim', 'dies', 'rots', 'Bornean', 'sun', 'couple', 'days', 'wonder', 'actors', 'movie', 'knew', 'were', 'playing', 'death.Much', 'acclaim', 'been', 'given', 'Brando', 'other', 'writers', 'here', 'could', 'understand', 'more', 'half', 'pathetic', 'mumblings', 'wonder', 'Brando', 'bad', 'mouthed', 'movie', 'made', 'bad', 'mouthed', 'lines', 'when', 'was', 'making', 'people', 'who', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'worth', 'seeing', 'several', 'times', 'time', 'more', 'could', 'be', 'got', 'were', 'evidently', 'referring', 'progressively', 'better', 'skills', 'interpreting', 'Brando', 'gurglings', 'perhaps', 'were', 'reading', 'lips', 'not', 'likely', 'seldom', 'moved', '.After', 'seeing', 'Ferris', 'Buehler', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'role', 'show', 'just', 'was', 'not', 'funny', 'situation', 'was', 'scary', 'became', 'unwilling', 'member', 'mob.The', 'story', 'was', 'incredible', 'unbelievable', 'who', 'think', 'everything', 'awesome', 'fabulous', 'incredible', 'What', 'rich', 'people', 'would', 'pay', 'upward', '250,000', 'eat', 'komodo', 'dragon', 'other', 'endangered', 'species', 'supposed', 'be', 'business', 'godfather', 'Brando', 'supposed', 'be', 'selling', 'illegal', 'meat', 'rich', 'dunces', 'what', 'get', 'money', 'turkey', 'instead', 'dragon', 'suppose', 'humor', 'bamboozled', 'rich', 'turkeys', 'acting', 'cannibals.Rent', 'dud', 'something', 'different', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'again']",N/A

Even though he finds the robber, he is still short on cash (NYU Film School's required books aren't cheap) and is receptive to the idea of a job as an errand boy.  He is stunned to meet his boss, Carmine Sabatini (Marlon Brando), who happens to look and sound like Don Vito Corleone.  Clark soon finds himself tangled with Sabatini's Mafia-like affairs, not to mention his daughter, but mixed with that is a genuine liking and respect for the pseudo-Don.  But with danger threatening from the Feds and a mob from South Amboy, is there a way out for both of them?A delight of humor, as both Broderick and Brando excel.  Look for a tour de force by Maximillian Schnell as the mysterious Larry London.Lots of in-jokes here, from the portrayal of NYU Film School to Sabatini telling Kellogg that he knows a few people in Hollywood!  The final scenes leave you laughing (Bert Parks hailing a Komodo Dragon with a Miss America parody, the very Germanic London being given intro music of a few notes of &quot;Deutchland Uber Alles&quot; and &quot;The Ride of the Valkyies&quot;, Sabatini addressing said Komodo Dragon with &quot;You cudda been a handbag&quot; (recalling the backseat scene from &quot;On the Waterfront&quot;).  The movie never takes itself too seriously.One wishes that, given the capabilities of the DVD, that more material would be given the viewer.  Unfortunately, we are left with the theatrical trailer and not much more.

This movie features complex plotting with comedic twists and an Academy award-winning performance by a very large lizard. Famous bottom line The Freshman is a fun movie.A young Matthew Broderick playing Clark Kellogg- Could there be a better name for an 'allll American boy!- arrives in New York where he is to attend film school. Instead he finds himself the victim of a robbery and deep in the hands of Carmine ""Jimmy the Toucan"" Sabatini (nobody really calls him that). Mr. Sabatini is a brilliant self-parody Marlon Brando, skewering his Godfather performance. The young Kellogg is drawn into a series of misadventures a planted romance with Tina Sabatini -Carmine's only daughter (Penelope Ann Miller) who is accepting of her father's criminal machinations and certainly more worldly wise than the entrapped freshman.Best supporting actor is a very large lizard in the role of a Komodo dragon. The lizard will have all the best of the physical humor.  I leave it to you to determine exactly what it means to train a lizard to act on demand without it attempting to bite anyone's head off.I count myself among the reviewers who admired Brando's self-parody but try to not miss the otherwise minor role of Larry London played by Maximilian Schnell. With a few deft lines he parodies most of his own career and summons the ghost of Peter Sellers as Dr. Strangelove. For more parody: the alternately film obsessed and craven Paul Benedict as Prof. Author Feebler (who is also a feeble author) converts another small role into another opportunity to poke fun at any of several institutions including Godfather movie intellectuals , film school and university professorsThe essence of farce is to keep the madness under control. This movie could've handled a little more madness but the control speaks of excellent direction.

10152,A3VO8JQT6LVXZ1,0767810848,Richard Ross,"[2, 2]","Marlon Brando did what few actors have pulled off with the Freshman. He parodied his most iconic character and got some of the best reviews of his career. Most actors who attempt this  are taken to task for repeating a performance or becoming a self parody of themselves. Brando always did whatever he wanted though which is what made him the greatest. This film benefits greatly from him because when he is not on screen it gets to be a bit silly and boring. I don't want to take away from Matthew Broderick who gives a very strong performance as Clark Kellogg. Clark has just moved to New York to study film at N.Y.U. After he arrives he is  robbed by a cabbie (Bruno Kirby) who makes off with Clark's cash and luggage. Needing money to buy his books for school he is in need of a job. When he spots the cabbie hauling his luggage up the street he chases him down after which the cabbie offers him a job working for his uncle Carmine. Clark remains suspicious even after he meets Carmine Sabatini (Brando). They based the character of the Godfather on Carmine Clark is told. He offers Clark a position as a delivery man of sorts. Sabatini is an importer who needs someone to make pickups and deliveries for him twice a week. The pay is good:  a couple of thousand a week . Clark has his doubts and reluctantly goes to work for Sabatini. His first pickup is a giant lizard which he is to deliver to an an exclusive supper club that Sabatini owns where it will be served up to some rich people at an upcoming dinner. The lizard is endangered and soon two F.B.I. agents are after Clark leaning on him to give up Sabatini. Clark has begun to regard him as a father by this point since his real father died when he was young so he is conflicted. Lots of mafia movie parodies and conventions are played out in this one. The supporting cast includes Penelope Ann Miller as Tina, Carmine's daughter who develops a crush on Clark, and Frank Whaley who plays Clark's college roommate who goes with him to pick up the cargo. Brando is responsible for the funniest moments in the film. Even though he was big he was still graceful and handsome. After the film wrapped but before it opened he disowned the film saying it would be a flop. He later retracted those statements and said the film was a wonderful comedy with moments that would be remembered for some time.

Getting screwed into taking Bio at 8 a.m. on Fridays. Not having a fake I.D. -- and not knowing enough people who do. RA's busting you for partying in your room. The list goes on and on.Few of us, however, can claim to having as abysmal a start to their collegiate career as Clark Kellogg (Matthew Broderick) in ""The Freshman."" The naive Clark, who hails from Vermont, is set to attend New York University as the film begins. Shortly after arriving in NYC, he meets alleged cab driver Victor Ray (played by the talented Bruno Kirby, best known for his lead role in ""City Slickers""), who promptly steals his luggage. As Clark so aptly puts it in his amusing voice-over narration, ""I had been in New York for 19 minutes and 11 seconds, and I was already ruined.""Fortunately (or not) for Clark, his path crosses again with Victor Ray, which leads him to Carmine Sabatini (Marlon Brando), an elderly Italian gentleman who bears a striking resemblance to none other than the Godfather, Don Corleone. Before Clark knows what's happening, he's running errands (possibly illegal) for Carmine, is engaged to his beautiful daughter, and is being followed by federal agents.The chemistry between Broderick and Brando is one of the movie's strongest points. Broderick is a talented comic actor who's perfect here as the innocent straight man, and Brando is also wonderful in a role that smartly nods to his legendary work in ""The Godfather."" Check out the scenes where Carmine and Clark drink cappucino, discuss Mussolini and exchange the ""kiss of kisses."" Priceless stuff.Aside from Broderick and Brando, ""The Freshman"" boasts a solid supporting cast with many faces you'll recognize, from the aforementioned Kirby to Penelope Ann Miller (""Carlito's Way"") to Frank Whaley, who you may recall from his unfortunate experience of snacking on a Royale With Cheese when Travolta and Samuel L. pay him a visit in ""Pulp Fiction."" All are solid.Fans of the ""Godfather"" trilogy will love this movie and the numerous Godfather references, including several highly amusing scenes in which Clark's film teacher screens and comments on sections of ""The Godfather Part II."" However, you need not be familiar with the ""Godfather"" films to enjoy this movie. Writer/Director Andrew Bergman (who also wrote ""Fletch"" and co-wrote 'Blazing Saddles"") has penned a comedy that effectively ranges from slapstick (Clark transporting a komodo dragon) to smart (Mona Lisa and ""Godfather"" references) to bizarre (supporting character Larry London's observation that ""Carmine said one boy.
