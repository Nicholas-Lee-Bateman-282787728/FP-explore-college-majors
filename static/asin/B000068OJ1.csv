705034,A1RGN7M6P3HI98,B000068OJ1,A. Alfred,"[14, 20]","Before purchasing this movie I would recommend one small thing...WATCH THE TV SERIES!!!!!!  End of Evangelion is simply, the end of the Neon Genesis Evangelion saga.  Nope there will be no new series, and nope no new movies either.  End of Evangelion takes place in a two part episode closure to the 27 episode epic series.  Another note:  YOU WILL BE COMPLELETY LOST IF YOU DON'T BOTHER WITH THE SERIES AND SKIP TO THE MOVIE!!!!  (Click on my name and follow a link to my review of the series).  The end of Evangelion is a beautiful well deserved ending of how the series should have ended.  Should have ending? your wondering.  Well, many fans of the series disliked the direction in which episode's 26 and 27 of the series concluded the story.  Basically it's like watching a huge action movie, then once the ending is about to happen you suddenly see ""The End"" pop up on the screen.  The series might not have ending as boring as that, but episode's 26 and 27 gave no indication as to how the crisis of the Evangelion story ending.  And so End of Evangelion was created, the true ending of the series, well more like a more involved ending that the series should have concluded with.  But I do suggest, if you can sit through it, to watch episode 26 and 27 of the original series too since in a way, both endings deal with the same issue of Shinji acknowledging his humanity.  Don't worry, that wasn't a spoiler, the true ending of the series goes far beyond that.Story:  The movie begins where episode 25 left off.  The final Angel has been killed at the cost of Shinji's metal stability with Third Impact is looming in the distance.  The movie begins with the initiation of the Instrumentality Project, the heart of the entire storyline of the series.  What happen to the project if it even was implemented was a subject episode's 26 and 27 completely dismissed.  As the Instrumentality Project is initiated Nerv is....oh wait, don't want to spoil it for ya.  WATCH THE MOVIE!!!Animation:  The new animation is excellent.  You can see the different between the animation  here and those used in the series.  This animation, though sometime a bit less detailed as the series, gives more in a way of emotional expressions and real life like fluid human movement in the characters.  The action never skips a beat, and the ending, my goodness, you will never see true animation as superb as this once the Instrumentality Project is initiated.  Pause the movie if you want to blink, you do not want to miss anything. WATCH THE MOVIE!!!!Characters:  You should know the characters by now.  But now, we are given more of a brief look into Seele, the organization behind Nerv and their true want for the future of humanity.  WATCH THE MOVIE!!!!Conclusion of Series:  Many people might disagree with the ending since, in a way, it takes some of the negative aspects of episode's 26 and 27, though shorten. But the overall ending is well done.  Almost all your questions will be answered.  What is Adam.  What are Angels.  What is the Instrumentality Project.  Who and what is Rei.  Her purpose and role in the Third Impact and what the Third Impact is.  So many issues were perfectly addressed in order to give this superb series a glorious ending. Don't look any further folks, this is it.

So I'll just settle for this one.I don't place value judgments on Japanese culture and society, but I can say I don't like it.  I find it sexist towards women particularly.This series began with a simple, almost stupid concept involving giant mecha-Angels attacking New Japan and little kids who can sync up with Evas to fight them.Apparently the original ending (which I found particularly brilliant despite the awful turn the series took) wasn't good enough for bi-polar Hideaki Anno, who decided to take a beautiful mental introspective of overcoming your problems, and **** all over it to make a suicidal whiny little emo's delight of an ending.Everything that the Neon Genesis Evangelion storyline was building to is effectively rendered pointless and useless by this story, which consists of really tasteless and poorly executed sequences of SEELE murdering NERV employees with all the cinematic and animation tact and seriousness of an unrated spoof of ""Hostel"", followed by Asuka waking up in her machine and destroying lots of military machines in her Eva.But what does any of that matter, when Misato sacrifices her life for Shinji to survive and save the world, only for Shinji to go whiny he-bitch emo and do nothing so that the ""Human Instrumentality Project"" can be unleashed, and basically every single human being in the world (except somehow Shinji and Asuka) is killed and ""merged"" into one giant human who looks like Rei.Whatever your philosophy is, I find it BS.  In my view, there is no way any person can be ""merged"" with another to form one being.  Even if it did, there's only one of them, they can't reproduce, and they're too damn big to live on the earth.  So essentially, the human race dies, especially after Shinji chokes Asuka to death.And so at the end of the series, we see a whiny little emo bitch unleashing his man-boy angst in an art medium, and giving us an ending so full of despair, tragedy, and sadness that it becomes overwhelmingly dismal and pointless.  And where was the purpose in having Shinji masturbate and ejaculate on a topless Asuka while she's in a coma in the hospital?There is a difference between ""sad endings"" and horrible endings.  A ""sad ending"" to a movie or series can be done tastefully, like with ""Cowboy Bebop"", another anime, or with movies like ""Midnight Cowboy"", the director's cut of ""Blade Runner"", ""Chinatown"", or ""The Shining"".What is instead given here is the equivalent of a suicidal teenaged boy who threatens to kill himself because his parents won't let him go to a concert on a schoolnight, or because his girlfriend doesn't spend like hanging out with his friends, or because he got a 'B' on his science project.",1,A final summation of a series suffering severe entropy,1233878400,"02 6, 2009",2009,2867,"['Spoilers', 'follow.I', 'get', 'Death', 'Rebirth', 'meshed', 'head', 'struggled', 'not', 'include', 'review', 'here', 'Death', 'Rebirth', 'one', 'So', ""'ll"", 'just', 'settle', 'one.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'place', 'value', 'judgments', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'society', 'can', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'find', 'sexist', 'towards', 'women', 'particularly.This', 'series', 'began', 'simple', 'almost', 'stupid', 'concept', 'involving', 'giant', 'mecha-Angels', 'attacking', 'New', 'Japan', 'little', 'kids', 'who', 'can', 'sync', 'up', 'Evas', 'fight', 'them.Apparently', 'original', 'ending', 'found', 'particularly', 'brilliant', 'awful', 'turn', 'series', 'took', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'enough', 'bi-polar', 'Hideaki', 'Anno', 'who', 'decided', 'take', 'beautiful', 'mental', 'introspective', 'overcoming', 'problems', '****', 'make', 'suicidal', 'whiny', 'little', 'emo', 'delight', 'ending.Everything', 'Neon', 'Genesis', 'Evangelion', 'storyline', 'was', 'building', 'effectively', 'rendered', 'pointless', 'useless', 'story', 'really', 'tasteless', 'poorly', 'executed', 'sequences', 'SEELE', 'murdering', 'NERV', 'employees', 'cinematic', 'animation', 'tact', 'seriousness', 'unrated', 'spoof', 'Hostel', 'followed', 'Asuka', 'waking', 'up', 'machine', 'destroying', 'lots', 'military', 'machines', 'Eva.But', 'what', 'matter', 'when', 'Misato', 'life', 'Shinji', 'survive', 'save', 'world', 'only', 'Shinji', 'go', 'whiny', 'he-bitch', 'emo', 'do', 'nothing', 'so', 'Human', 'Instrumentality', 'Project', 'can', 'be', 'unleashed', 'basically', 'single', 'human', 'being', 'world', 'somehow', 'Shinji', 'Asuka', 'killed', 'merged', 'one', 'giant', 'human', 'who', 'Rei.Whatever', 'philosophy', 'find', 'BS', 'view', 'way', 'person', 'can', 'be', 'merged', 'form', 'one', 'being', 'Even', 'did', 'only', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'reproduce', ""'re"", 'too', 'damn', 'big', 'live', 'earth', 'So', 'essentially', 'human', 'race', 'dies', 'especially', 'Shinji', 'chokes', 'Asuka', 'death.And', 'so', 'end', 'series', 'see', 'whiny', 'little', 'emo', 'bitch', 'unleashing', 'man-boy', 'angst', 'art', 'medium', 'giving', 'ending', 'so', 'full', 'despair', 'tragedy', 'sadness', 'overwhelmingly', 'dismal', 'pointless', 'where', 'was', 'purpose', 'having', 'Shinji', 'masturbate', 'ejaculate', 'topless', 'Asuka', 'coma', 'hospital', 'difference', 'sad', 'endings', 'horrible', 'endings', 'sad', 'ending', 'movie', 'series', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'tastefully', 'Cowboy', 'Bebop', 'anime', 'movies', 'Midnight', 'Cowboy', 'director', 'cut', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'Chinatown', 'Shining', 'instead', 'given', 'here', 'equivalent', 'suicidal', 'teenaged', 'boy', 'who', 'kill', 'parents', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'concert', 'schoolnight', 'girlfriend', ""n't"", 'spend', 'hanging', 'out', 'friends', 'got', 'B', 'science', 'project']",N/A
705037,A29Y34ALWJUGB5,B000068OJ1,"Antonio D. Paolucci ""Collector of Entertainment""","[1, 1]","This movie wraps up Evangelion like the series never could, answering most of the questions that you were left to answer all on your own during those final two episodes of Evangelion. Instead of Shinji sitting in a chair in a black room, pondering his own sanity, we see him sitting in a chair next to a comatose Asuka as teenage fantasy flies through his mind. Though surely a disturbing start, it's more than what was given in the final episodes of Evangelion.The story itself takes place after the end of episode twenty-four. Nerv is on the edge of destruction from outside agencies. Stormed by soldiers bent on killing the Childs (Asuka, Shinji, and Rei), the people of Nerv must not only save these children, but also attempt to stop the impending destruction of the world. The one person able to keep her head during the crisis, Misato, and truly the only person who cares for the children, does everything in her power to save Shinji and the others. What follows are tense battles between Nerv personnel and an outside force of murderous soldiers, charged to kill on sight. That's basically the first part, and I'd hate to ruin this for the few Evangelion fans who haven't seen this movie, so I'll quit now, leaving the rest to be seen.I will say that Asuka finally gets her moment to shine in this one. In what is perhaps the greatest piece of action I've seen out of an anime, Asuka takes on nine ""mechs"" on her own, and does a hell of a job. Another bonus is the updated music, which got better since the series. And, of course, the animation quality is higher in this because it was a theatrical release. Manga also respected the fans of dubbed titles by bringing in the original ADV voice cast.Though I'll give this movie a 5, it wasn't all praise. They still stole a lot of time by using constant still-imagery. The story itself gets a little more disturbing, especially with the fact that two fourteen year old girls are almost constantly running around nude. The blood and gore is also upped in this; there's one moment where we watch a head slowly separate from a neck and fall away. Now, this isn't rare in anime, but it was rare in the Evangelion series, and it seemed to me that the creators took every possible liberty they could to make their teenage anime seem adult. Though it doesn't take much away, it doesn't quite feel the same.Still, that doesn't explain for the fact that we were left without this ending for some time. Though I wasn't personally disappointed by the ending to the series, I was left confused and wanting more, especially with the alternate reality they presented. The End of Evangelion is what we should have seen.Not only is this a masterpiece of animation, but, as a whole, Evangelion has one of the best stories ever written, with plenty of Biblical symbolism and the taboo presented so often it seems normal here. And when combined with the End of Evangelion, the story actually wraps up nicely. However, I'd only recommend this to fans who have seen the series, because everything that goes on in this movie correlates directly with first twenty-four episodes of the series.",5,What We Should Have Seen,1137628800,"01 19, 2006",2006,3125,"['movie', 'up', 'Evangelion', 'series', 'never', 'could', 'answering', 'most', 'questions', 'were', 'left', 'answer', 'own', 'final', 'two', 'episodes', 'Evangelion', 'Instead', 'Shinji', 'sitting', 'chair', 'black', 'room', 'pondering', 'own', 'sanity', 'see', 'sitting', 'chair', 'next', 'comatose', 'Asuka', 'teenage', 'fantasy', 'flies', 'mind', 'Though', 'surely', 'disturbing', 'start', 'more', 'what', 'was', 'given', 'final', 'episodes', 'Evangelion.The', 'story', 'place', 'end', 'episode', 'twenty-four', 'Nerv', 'edge', 'destruction', 'outside', 'agencies', 'Stormed', 'soldiers', 'bent', 'killing', 'Childs', 'Asuka', 'Shinji', 'Rei', 'people', 'Nerv', 'must', 'not', 'only', 'save', 'children', 'also', 'attempt', 'stop', 'impending', 'destruction', 'world', 'one', 'person', 'able', 'keep', 'head', 'crisis', 'Misato', 'truly', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'children', 'everything', 'power', 'save', 'Shinji', 'others', 'What', 'are', 'tense', 'battles', 'Nerv', 'personnel', 'outside', 'force', 'murderous', 'soldiers', 'charged', 'kill', 'sight', 'basically', 'first', 'part', ""'d"", 'hate', 'ruin', 'few', 'Evangelion', 'fans', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'so', ""'ll"", 'quit', 'now', 'leaving', 'rest', 'be', 'seen.I', 'will', 'say', 'Asuka', 'finally', 'moment', 'shine', 'one', 'what', 'perhaps', 'greatest', 'piece', 'action', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'anime', 'Asuka', 'nine', 'mechs', 'own', 'hell', 'job', 'bonus', 'updated', 'music', 'got', 'better', 'series', 'course', 'animation', 'quality', 'higher', 'was', 'theatrical', 'release', 'Manga', 'also', 'respected', 'fans', 'dubbed', 'titles', 'bringing', 'original', 'ADV', 'voice', 'cast.Though', ""'ll"", 'give', 'movie', '5', 'was', ""n't"", 'praise', 'still', 'stole', 'lot', 'time', 'using', 'constant', 'still-imagery', 'story', 'little', 'more', 'disturbing', 'especially', 'fact', 'two', 'fourteen', 'year', 'old', 'girls', 'are', 'almost', 'constantly', 'running', 'around', 'nude', 'blood', 'gore', 'also', 'upped', 'one', 'moment', 'where', 'watch', 'head', 'slowly', 'separate', 'neck', 'fall', 'away', 'Now', ""n't"", 'rare', 'anime', 'was', 'rare', 'Evangelion', 'series', 'seemed', 'creators', 'took', 'possible', 'liberty', 'could', 'make', 'teenage', 'anime', 'seem', 'adult', ""n't"", 'take', 'much', 'away', ""n't"", 'quite', 'feel', 'same.Still', ""n't"", 'explain', 'fact', 'were', 'left', 'ending', 'time', 'was', ""n't"", 'personally', 'disappointed', 'ending', 'series', 'was', 'left', 'confused', 'wanting', 'more', 'especially', 'alternate', 'reality', 'presented', 'End', 'Evangelion', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'seen.Not', 'only', 'masterpiece', 'animation', 'whole', 'Evangelion', 'one', 'best', 'stories', 'ever', 'written', 'plenty', 'Biblical', 'symbolism', 'taboo', 'presented', 'so', 'often', 'normal', 'here', 'when', 'combined', 'End', 'Evangelion', 'story', 'actually', 'up', 'nicely', 'However', ""'d"", 'only', 'recommend', 'fans', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'series', 'everything', 'movie', 'directly', 'first', 'twenty-four', 'episodes', 'series']",N/A
705038,A3B249FQ2OJBCQ,B000068OJ1,"AstroNerdBoy ""AstroNerdBoy""","[9, 18]","I watched the Neon Genesis Evangelion series and was impressed with the writing.  I'm not a huge anime fan, but I love good stories combined with good character development.  So while Evengelion started out seeming like a typical mecha (giant robot) battle series, it quickly turned to deep, character stories while advancing the overall story arc.  The final two episodes (#25 and #26) of the series were very bizare, confusing, depressing, extremely deep, and answered nothing much.  Different people read different things into the ending causing endless debate.  Since no questions were really answered, people demanded action!Thus, ""End of Evangelion"" is born.  In this DVD, the action takes place after episode 24.  Rather than look at this as a totally new ending, one should look at this as an extention of the original episodes 25 and 26.  The mental trip that the main character Shinji takes is still here though shorter and more depressing (IMO).  The fun part of this movie is when Asuka ""wakes up"" after coming to understand the EVA units.  She then takes on a large number of production EVA units and kicks butt (to the joy of people who wanted to see her do this).  The amazing thing is how Asuka's transformation comes off as believable (a tribute to the writers) and her character suddenly becomes...likeable!  :-DAh, but the messing with the mind is still here as that is the point of the story -- very deep and disturbing concepts of humanity and the end of the world.  It's not the way I would have gone, but it is the way the series creator wanted to go.  So that's that and we'll go on.Ultimately, I think this whole series and the movies are about a couple of things.  First, I get the feeling of resentment over the introduction of the Jesuites to Japan (and thus an attack or destruction of culture).  Second is the quest of the 14-year old hero Shinji's quest to score!Shinji has three babes in his life.  First, there's Misato Katsuragi.  She's Shinji's immediate supervisor as well as his guardian whom he lives with.  She's a hottie, yet because she's a mother figure (as well as the age difference), he can do nothing to hook up with her.  Then there's Asuka.  She's another 14-year old & pilot of EVA-02.  She's very cute and sexy, but because she's always putting him down, he can't hook up with her.  Finally, there's Rei whom we learn at the end of the series is a clone of Sinji's mother.  Before he knows this, he is also attracted to her as she is cute yet very quiet and distant.  However, since she is a clone of his mother, he can't hook up with her.If you don't believe me, watch the series then the movie.  You'd have to be pretty blind not to see it since they make sure to put it ""in your face"" (pardon the expression) to make you get the point.  In the end, it is my belief that Shinji combines all three into the ""reborn"" Asuka.  But that's just my thoughts.  I wonder what her last words as the movie ended mean -- ""How disgusting"".As to the DVD itself, the English dub is well done, but if you want to hear the Japanese audio, that's there as well.  The best part of the DVD is the audio commentary by the English dub director (and voice of Rei) Amanda Winn Lee.  With her are Jason Lee and Tailesin Jaffe who do voices on the series.  Jason Lee's knowledge of occult and Catholic religion is very helpful to explaining things in the movie.  Amanda also explains why they did certain things in the translations for those who wanted an exact translation of the Japanese.  While they are very faithful, the tiny liberties they took did not offend me.Bottom line:  This movie left me extremely depressed.

Let me tell you, there's no way, just no way to predict or even imagine what will happen.I know lot of people were disappointed by episode 24-26, where it shows psychomental status of Shinji, instead of showing what really happened at the end.  This last episode will show you what really happened at the end.  Yes, not only it will show you what really happened at the end, but also it will show you some inside story, insights, which will help you to understand the difficult part of previous episodes.The very reason they put this episode apart from previous 8DVD, not including 'Evangelion Death & Rebirth', will become apparent as you watch them.  They needed to separate this one because it needs special attention, special recognition, as it really sums up all the episode in this grand finale.Not only they've changed the intermission (with 'Fly me to the Moon') but also changed the music as well.  The ending music used to be this variation of 'Fly me to the Moon', however, the music was tastefully done, adding this feeling you get when you question 'Who am I?, what's is human, or orgin of it, the existence of GOD'.SERIOUSLY, DON'T MISS OUT ON THIS NEEDLESS TO SAY THE BEST EPISODE OF THE NEON GENESIS EVANGELION SERIES.

It's probably the best example of a film that clearly defines ""WTF?"" yet it manages to bring out emotions. Be sure to watch it with the commentary too as some of it will be explained or at least interpreted.Without getting into too big explanation of who characters are and whatnot I'll just say the plot as is. You should really watch the entire series, including the infamous episodes 25 and 26 to understand. Why infamous? Well fans got so involved in the plot that when the last 2 episodes aired(which from what I can tell is more the metaphysical meaning or the psychological actions behind the characters) fans were in an uproar, even sending death threats to series creator Anno. FYI: Some of those death threats are including in kanji at the end. So End of Evangelion is what really happens to the characters.SEELE is trying to cause another Impact(again watch the series for everything) and they send in troops into NERV Headquarters to start it. Only thing stopping them is EVA pilots Shinji who's in serious depression mode and Asuka who's rather comatose. This goes into a bunch of stuff that is too hard to understand, let alone explain.One can't help but feel the movie is like a big ""up yours"" to fans(which Amanda Winn Lee, voice actor for Rei and other stuff) says in the commentary. It's like Anno said ""ok you want a real ending to Evangelion? Well here it is but boy am I gonna really mess you up with it"". Characters die rather gruesomely and half of it barely makes sense but Evangelion in a way was always designed to make you puzzle over it.If you were one of the many fans that were dissatisfied with Episodes 25 and 26 then this is for you but be warned it's quite brutal and really hard to understand but you'll sure enjoy it(if you're in the group that loves it)",5,"Never before will you care that you didn't ""get"" a film",1125446400,"08 31, 2005",2005,1958,"['Basically', 'what', 'mean', 'film', 'so', 'strange', 'complex', ""'ll"", 'love', 'hate', 'middle', 'ground', 'here', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'hell', 'happened', 'probably', 'best', 'example', 'film', 'clearly', 'WTF', 'bring', 'out', 'emotions', 'Be', 'sure', 'watch', 'commentary', 'too', 'will', 'be', 'explained', 'least', 'interpreted.Without', 'getting', 'too', 'big', 'explanation', 'who', 'characters', 'are', 'whatnot', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'plot', 'should', 'really', 'watch', 'entire', 'series', 'including', 'infamous', 'episodes', '25', '26', 'understand', 'Why', 'infamous', 'Well', 'fans', 'got', 'so', 'involved', 'plot', 'when', 'last', '2', 'episodes', 'aired', 'what', 'can', 'tell', 'more', 'metaphysical', 'meaning', 'psychological', 'actions', 'characters', 'fans', 'were', 'uproar', 'even', 'sending', 'death', 'threats', 'series', 'creator', 'Anno', 'FYI', 'death', 'threats', 'are', 'including', 'kanji', 'end', 'So', 'End', 'Evangelion', 'what', 'really', 'characters.SEELE', 'trying', 'cause', 'Impact', 'again', 'watch', 'series', 'everything', 'send', 'troops', 'NERV', 'Headquarters', 'start', 'Only', 'thing', 'stopping', 'EVA', 'pilots', 'Shinji', 'who', 'serious', 'depression', 'mode', 'Asuka', 'who', 'rather', 'comatose', 'bunch', 'stuff', 'too', 'hard', 'understand', 'let', 'alone', 'explain.One', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'movie', 'big', 'up', 'yours', 'fans', 'Amanda', 'Winn', 'Lee', 'voice', 'actor', 'Rei', 'other', 'stuff', 'commentary', 'Anno', 'said', 'want', 'real', 'ending', 'Evangelion', 'Well', 'here', 'boy', 'am', 'gon', 'really', 'mess', 'up', 'Characters', 'die', 'rather', 'gruesomely', 'half', 'barely', 'sense', 'Evangelion', 'way', 'was', 'always', 'designed', 'make', 'puzzle', 'it.If', 'were', 'one', 'many', 'fans', 'were', 'dissatisfied', 'Episodes', '25', '26', 'then', 'be', 'warned', 'quite', 'brutal', 'really', 'hard', 'understand', ""'ll"", 'sure', 'enjoy', ""'re"", 'group']",N/A

The reasons are not divulged, but there are rumors that sponsor funding was cut due to controversy about the content, and that Hideaki and Gainax were pressured to end the series differently, in a very short time frame. The result is that the final two episodes of the TV series bear little resemblance to the rest of the show. The book then goes on to say that the original scrapped scripts were essentially fished out of the garbage and were the basis for the feature film End of Evangelion. In other words, it's arguable that the final two episodes of the TV series are invalid, and that End of Evangelion is in fact the true ending to the series as originally envisioned by its creators.""",5,Ending of the original TV series vs. The End of Evangelion,1117756800,"06 3, 2005",2005,1117,"['just', 'wanted', 'post', 'quote', 'think', 'something', 'people', 'should', 'know', 'regarding', 'relationship', 'TV', 'series', 'movie', 'According', ""'The"", 'Red', 'Cross', 'Book', 'was', 'sold', 'End', 'Evangelion', 'screenings', 'original', 'theatrical', 'release', 'Japan', '1997', 'was', 'officially', 'endorsed', 'Gainax', 'original', 'scripts', 'final', 'two', 'episodes', 'TV', 'series', 'were', 'scrapped', 'last', 'minute', 'reasons', 'are', 'not', 'divulged', 'are', 'rumors', 'sponsor', 'funding', 'was', 'cut', 'due', 'controversy', 'content', 'Hideaki', 'Gainax', 'were', 'pressured', 'end', 'series', 'differently', 'very', 'short', 'time', 'frame', 'result', 'final', 'two', 'episodes', 'TV', 'series', 'bear', 'little', 'resemblance', 'rest', 'show', 'book', 'then', 'say', 'original', 'scrapped', 'scripts', 'were', 'essentially', 'fished', 'garbage', 'were', 'basis', 'feature', 'film', 'End', 'Evangelion', 'other', 'words', 'arguable', 'final', 'two', 'episodes', 'TV', 'series', 'are', 'invalid', 'End', 'Evangelion', 'fact', 'true', 'ending', 'series', 'originally', 'envisioned', 'creators']",N/A

The animation is much crisper and cleaner than the series, as to be expected. The soundtrack is almost operatic at times, with very beautiful vocals. Everything seems almost an overwhelming improvement.Now, then, the story. Without giving anything away, which wouldn't help you at all, firstly, you MUST see the original series before viewing this. Or at least watch ""Death and Rebirth"", an abbreviated collection of the happenings in the series. This is not because you won't understand character motivation or anything trite like that, but more to the fact that even HAVING seen the story line will leave you scratching your head and saying ""What the heck?""It starts off reminiscent of the later episodes, with several minutes of either silence or only very quiet speaking. For the first fifteen or twenty minutes, everything seems to be adrenaline pumped, but manageable. But about halfway through, or in episode 26'(the movie consists of two episodes, 25' and 26'. These are an alternate ending to the last two episodes in the series. Each is open to their own interpretation), everything is turned upside down. The revelations come so fast that it may leave some spinning. In fact, you're not MEANT to come away with a clear understanding. You have to uncover your own meaning behind the events. Don't fret, though. It doesn't read like a Dali painting or anything. It's fairly clear what's happening, but not WHY. A little background in Jewish and/or Christian mythologies is very helpful, since the whole series is based around these beliefs and symbolism.In the end though, ""End of Evangelion"" explores the characters more, answering a few questions as to Misato and Shinji's relationship as well as Gendo's and Rei's. It also helps to explain Asuka's sudden, dark mood swing near the end of the series. There is a clear-cut end to it all, which may leave you feeling any number of ways. In my heart of hearts, I wish there`d been a clear-cut end, with character relationships resolved and everyone happy. But such details are what make ""Evangelion"" unique.

It's a widely known fact that the TV production had run out of money by the final episodes, and one has to wonder how close to director Hideaki Anno's original ending the two-episode mindtrip that capped the series is.  Many fans hate the TV ending with a passion, although I found it to be a fascinating and appropriate end to what was essentially a character study with sci-fi trappings.That said, there were a whole lot of plot threads left dangling by the TV series, but luckily Anno made End of Evangelion to fill us in on all that.  Originally planned as an OVA rewrite of the final two episodes, the scripts got so out of control that Anno decided to just go ahead and make a feature to fill us in on what happened to Shinji and company once all hell broke loose.  The result is one of the most violent and psychologically disturbing anime films I've ever seen, and if you thought the characters in the TV show were messed up the movie goes a long way toward explaining why.Yet there is something about the pacing, storytelling, and cineamatic flair Anno brings to his film that lends the violence meaning beyond shock value.  This film takes the head games of the TV show to an extreme, forcing the audience to think about and evaluate the meaning of what its seeing.  Like the TV show, Anno doesn't always spell out what we're seeing, leaving some things for the audience to piece together.  The clues are there, but its up the viewer to put the puzzle together.This movie also sports some brilliant acting moments for the characters.  For me, the most striking image in the film is Asuka curled in a fetal position mumblings ""I don't wanna die"" while bombs go off all around her.  This is a powerful moment of cinema, and takes a widely reviled character and for a brief moment makes her a real person who you understand and empathize with.  There are also some strong moments for Misato and some of the lesser, secondary characters.The End of Evangelion does everything it sets out to do.  It clarifies the end of the TV series and answers many of the questions left dangling from the show.  It puts a definitive cap of the story and satisfies the fans' lust for some big budget battle sequences (with some truly creepy foes).  And though the ending can be interpretted in a number of ways, I find it on a whole to be a tad more upbeat than the TV ending, providing a glimmer of hope among all that chaos and destruction.  And this DVD has a very informative commentary that will point out all sorts of things you probably missed the first time around, as well as give you tidbits into what the dub producers think it all means.Although most considerer the movie an alternate and/or ""real"" ending to Evangelion, I find the film to be complimentary to the TV series ending.  Neither one fully makes sense without the other, and taken together they form a compelling, albeit very disturbing, take on the end of the world.",5,And You Thought the TV Series Messed With Your Head,1092268800,"08 12, 2004",2004,3044,"['ending', 'Neon', 'Genesis', 'Evangelion', 'TV', 'series', 'been', 'cause', 'controversy', 'ever', 'first', 'aired', 'widely', 'known', 'fact', 'TV', 'production', 'had', 'run', 'money', 'final', 'episodes', 'one', 'wonder', 'how', 'close', 'director', 'Hideaki', 'Anno', 'original', 'ending', 'two-episode', 'mindtrip', 'capped', 'series', 'Many', 'fans', 'hate', 'TV', 'ending', 'passion', 'found', 'be', 'fascinating', 'appropriate', 'end', 'what', 'was', 'essentially', 'character', 'study', 'sci-fi', 'trappings.That', 'said', 'were', 'whole', 'lot', 'plot', 'threads', 'left', 'dangling', 'TV', 'series', 'luckily', 'Anno', 'made', 'End', 'Evangelion', 'fill', 'Originally', 'planned', 'OVA', 'rewrite', 'final', 'two', 'episodes', 'scripts', 'got', 'so', 'control', 'Anno', 'decided', 'just', 'go', 'ahead', 'make', 'feature', 'fill', 'what', 'happened', 'Shinji', 'company', 'once', 'hell', 'broke', 'loose', 'result', 'one', 'most', 'violent', 'psychologically', 'disturbing', 'anime', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'thought', 'characters', 'TV', 'show', 'were', 'messed', 'up', 'movie', 'long', 'way', 'explaining', 'why.Yet', 'something', 'pacing', 'storytelling', 'cineamatic', 'flair', 'Anno', 'film', 'violence', 'meaning', 'shock', 'value', 'film', 'head', 'games', 'TV', 'show', 'extreme', 'forcing', 'audience', 'think', 'evaluate', 'meaning', 'what', 'seeing', 'TV', 'show', 'Anno', ""n't"", 'always', 'spell', 'out', 'what', ""'re"", 'seeing', 'leaving', 'things', 'audience', 'piece', 'together', 'clues', 'are', 'there', 'up', 'viewer', 'put', 'puzzle', 'together.This', 'movie', 'also', 'sports', 'brilliant', 'acting', 'moments', 'characters', 'most', 'striking', 'image', 'film', 'Asuka', 'curled', 'fetal', 'position', 'mumblings', 'do', ""n't"", 'wan', 'die', 'bombs', 'go', 'powerful', 'moment', 'cinema', 'widely', 'reviled', 'character', 'brief', 'moment', 'real', 'person', 'who', 'understand', 'empathize', 'are', 'also', 'strong', 'moments', 'Misato', 'lesser', 'secondary', 'characters.The', 'End', 'Evangelion', 'everything', 'out', 'do', 'end', 'TV', 'series', 'answers', 'many', 'questions', 'left', 'dangling', 'show', 'definitive', 'cap', 'story', 'fans', 'lust', 'big', 'budget', 'battle', 'sequences', 'truly', 'creepy', 'foes', 'ending', 'can', 'be', 'interpretted', 'number', 'ways', 'find', 'whole', 'be', 'tad', 'more', 'upbeat', 'TV', 'ending', 'providing', 'glimmer', 'hope', 'chaos', 'destruction', 'DVD', 'very', 'informative', 'commentary', 'will', 'point', 'out', 'sorts', 'things', 'probably', 'missed', 'first', 'time', 'around', 'as', 'well', 'give', 'tidbits', 'what', 'dub', 'producers', 'think', 'most', 'considerer', 'movie', 'alternate', 'and/or', 'real', 'ending', 'Evangelion', 'find', 'film', 'be', 'complimentary', 'TV', 'series', 'ending', 'one', 'fully', 'sense', 'other', 'taken', 'together', 'form', 'compelling', 'albeit', 'very', 'disturbing', 'take', 'end', 'world']",N/A

All the giant robots, strange aliens, and militaristic government hoo-ha all boil down to the fact that Shinji couldn't reconcile his own guilt at being a confused, sex-crazed pubescent boy.  I've been there myself, but at least I didn't destroy the world!  I think the first and last scenes of this excellent and visually-stunning anime lend creedence to my new theory: We open with a scene where Shinji is rightly ashamed of himself for masturbating beside Auska's broken body lying in a hospital bed; and end with his damnation to spend eternity haunted by the adolescent embodiment of heavenly beauty in a female form encompassing the three strong feminine influences in his life.Maybe my interpretation doesn't fit with much more complex versions, but it does serve to illustrate much of Shinji's problems.

705054,A3E68QNSCABRVW,B000068OJ1,"Gradient Vector Field ""subjectedtometal (dot)...","[1, 2]","I'm probably going to get flack from both sides for my relatively neutral rating of this attempt to rewrite the ending of the series ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"".  How do I know it's an attempted re-write?  Because there are episode numbers in here and they're clearly marked as the last two episodes from the full series boxed set (at least that's how I'm interpreting these numbers).  Now for the most part I liked the series and the world the author tried to create, but like the final two episodes before, these episodes are also fairly confusing.  Let me try to explain as best I can.How do you explain an extremely confusing life experience such as depression, when you're having a difficult time with concepts like self worth, your usefulness in the world, or even who you are and how you relate to others?  The answer is surprisingly simple, you simply don't.  I can't think of a coherent way to include all of these elements given the two episode time frame the author appears to be giving himself to work with.  I think this, single handedly, is the downfall of this series.  Instead I think these themes should have been slowly introduced to the audience over the entire series, not all at once.  Granted I'm sure it accurately simulates the confusion the author went through in his personal life, but it's just not a good idea if you want to try and convey this message to a very broad audience.Strangely I think the last two episodes on the main series were a little easier to understand.  I understand what he was trying to do with ""The End of Evangelion"" and visually it feels like it integrates into the series more.  In this re-make there is another Mecha battle and it seems to flow from the series in a smoother fashion.  However, the content is a lot stranger, where Shinji doesn't want to help fight with his Eva unit.  Not to mention there is an allusion to a past intimate relationship between Shinji and Asako... I don't remember this ever happening in the series... other than the time they kissed, but it didn't seem like that manifested into anything beyond that one act.  Anyway, the imagery and art is beautiful and I really thought it was cool when one of images of ascension was the Ten Sephirot found in Kabbalah.  Seemed like a rather interesting choice.  I get the feeling like the main purpose of the message was something of primordial unity between all beings; at least that's what I gather from the last scene concerning Shinji and Rei.  However, I just thought its execution was overtly confusing.  The message didn't really need to be told in such an obtuse fashion and I just felt like it lacked the clarity that even the original version of the ending had.  I liked the fact that the imagery integrated with the main series more, but the explanation of the human instrumentality project seemed stranger.  Honestly, if I hadn't seen the ending episodes of the series to really reinforce my understanding of this re-write I don't think I would've been able to figure out what the writer was talking about.Overall this was a nice try and I certainly enjoyed the animation, but once again I felt the final message was weakly conveyed.  Trying to grasp something this complex into the time frame they've given themselves makes it nigh impossible to succeed!  This is a shame to me, because I think the message they are trying to send to the world is incredibly profound on many levels; psychological, philosophical or even theological.  I'm honestly not sure if I would recommend this to Evangelion fans, because I think most people will walk away feeling this isn't a suitable substitute.  Instead, what I think Anno should have done was actually build on what he already started.  Like continue Evangelion from where he left his audience in that confusing state then take this 90 minutes to sort of explain it in finer and more coherent detail.  Instead it feels like he tries to be too artistic or too poetic and presents it in a more convoluted manner.  Don't get me wrong, I certainly appreciate the art, but I think a great series is when you have balance between absolute clarity and some ambiguity.  This is all ambiguity and it's up to the viewer to try and discern what's going on.  One thing that I felt was wholly strange was in the beginning and in the end there is live video footage of real people.

705055,A3DXVAI08P00HD,B000068OJ1,Greg,"[8, 8]","Having watched the 'End of Evangelion' many times over, I still find it as baffling as ever.  Watching this movie is much like watching the climax of 2001 A Space Odyssey where David Bowman enters the 'stargate' at the monolith and undergoes his psychadelic trip to nowhere.  After such a bizarre parade of juxtaposed images, events and themes (often splashed around like images in a Picasso painting) you wonder what the hell it means.The End of Evangelion is the alternative ending to the 1996 anime television series directed by Hideki Anno.  Anno produced several works, however Evangelion proved to be the most popular (and controversial).On the surface the premise of the series is fairly straightforward and similar to many other science fiction anime series; a group of humans living in a post-apocalyptic world are fighting to defend humanity from alien invaders.  In Evangelion the aliens are called 'Angels', powerful and dangerous beings who appear to come from another dimension and cannot be defeated except by giant robots piloted by young children.The main character in the series is the anti-hero Shinji, a cowardly, indecisive, apathetic and introverted character who is frequently depressed and gripped by anomie and acedia and seems to be unable to do the most basic tasks without being forced by other people.  As the series unfolds it is clear Shinji and how he relates to others is somehow central not just to the angel-human conflict but even perhaps to the salvation of mankind itself.Shinji relates most closely to three characters, Azuka, Misato, and his father, Gendo Ikari.  As the series unfolds each of the characters is revealed to have a deeply tragic past which has resulted in all having very severe neurotic and psychological problems which border on hysteria and nervous breakdown.  Indeed virtually all the characters come to pieces, either mentally or physically, as the series progresses and darkens.The End of Evangelion seems to complement the interior fragmentation and destruction of the selves of the main characters by telling the 'narrative' of events in the external world.  NERV is invaded and destroyed by a human invasion after the last angel is defeated in battle and the main characters are killed, including Azuka (in a rather horrible and gruesome way).  Shinji, trapped in psychotic shock at the death of Azuka, enters his evangelion but is then taken by other evangelions who seem to undergo a bizarre ritual which reforms the 'Tree of life', the central symbol of kabbalastic mysticism.  This leads to a giant Goddess-figure called Lilith rising to life, who proceeds to bring about the end of the world by merging the souls of all individual humans back into an undifferentiated unity, while Shinji looks on.For some reason the process seems to fail and Lilith dies, perhaps because Shinji exercises his free will to remain an individual being rather than to re-merge his self into God.  Azuka, perhaps also merged with aspects of Rei and Shinji's mother, also reemerges beside him along a deserted shoreline, while the rest of humanity and life remains as a red soup, an undifferentiated unity from which all things began.  At the end Shinji attempts to strangle Azuka but relents, and then Azuka says 'How disgusting.'The ending of the world and the 'recreation' of a new world seems to contain some very complex themes, such as free will, the relation of humans to the Absolute, how we relate to the 'Other' and existence in an incomplete world where the paradox of reality is where we suffer but suffering is also part of growth.  Anno seems to draw deeply on Kabbalistic mysticism, Existential philosophy (many of the themes in the end are allegories of themes explored by philosophers like Heidigger, Sartre, Gadamer and Emmanuel Levinas) and Christian symbolism.  Why Anno chose to use symbols from the Judeo-Christian tradition (in particular Kabbalah) for the series and the end I am not sure, but perhaps Anno felt the Zohar's profound sense of exile in a world where the divine is deeply hidden and absent and associated existential themes of angst, alienation, being in relation to death and nothingness were appropriate when dealing with psychological themes such as repressed emotions, the unconcious, introversion and extroversion, sexual desire, and frustration of our dreams and goals, and suffering.I get the sense the ending of Evangelion is open, and I think Anno intended it to be so.  To 'close' Evangelion where everyone is happy and gets what they wish seems to negate the deeper premise of the series which pointed to the universality of human suffering in the inner and outer worlds; the extremes of torture and pain all the characters endure to the point of death seems excessive but perhaps makes the important point there is no safe refuge in this world of change where the divine seems absent.  While using Christian/Jewish imagery and western philosophical themes, I get the sense in the end Anno's message is Buddhist; we learn to grow through suffering, pain and evil and by accepting ourselves as we are, and we must accept there is evil and pain in all of existence and there is no escaping it, as evil and good exist even in the Godhead itself.  In this sense Anno approaches the Gnostic systems of Jacob Boehme and also some of the more radical forms of Kabbalah, where humans must restore a broken world by experiencing good as well as evil.Certainly the End of Evangelion is a multilayered world with extremely complex imagery, and cannot be watched as most other ordinary movies would be.",5,A baffling end to a baffling

It's a lot like the latter two 'Matrix' movies. I don't think much of the 'message,' myself; it just seems too diffuse, obscure and pretentious. Still, this is Evangelion, and it deserves at least two stars for that. I'd watch anything involving the Evangelion characters, even if it were just Shinji and Asuka standing on an empty stage reading the balcony scene from Romeo and Juliet. Evangelion was the product of a group of brilliant minds, and it would take incredible power, some kind of anti-brilliance, to obscure that. Then there's the scene where Asuka goes berserk and starts kicking. She needed that scene.On one hand, also, I did get some enjoyment from the trippy 2001-esque sequences; on the other hand, though, some things in the film are just sloppily handled, like the choice of music at certain points.

It's somewhat light hearted with some serious issues being dealt with.The last episodes of the series seem more like switching vehicles than switching gears. I don't know what the director was trying to do or where he was trying to go but in the end the change was to drastic from the overall feel of the series for this to work. And it answered nothing.The first half of ""Death and Rebirth"" is nothing more than a summing up of the entire series via quick flashes of images and shorts that establish where everyone is and how they got there. The second half is another switching of gears as the government revokes all the special rights of NERV and sends in the Special Forces to kill them all. Gritty and graphic with intense violence all directed at the people who had been risking their lives to save humanity. In the end it was man and not the Angels who imposed the most death and destruction on NERV.And in the end... There was no END. There was simply a set up for something else later.

My thought is if you have watched or are going to watch the series then skip ""Death and Rebirth"" and go straight to The ""End of Evangelion"".The first half of ""End of Eva"" is the last half of ""Death and Rebirth"" pretty much scene for scene. Since the first half of ""Death and Rebirth"" is nothing more than a sum up of the series there is really nothing there to see unless you are really a die-hard.""The End of Eva"" at least puts things at a conclusion even if you don't like what that conclusion is. Everybody's cards are laid on the table and Third Impact finally arrives. And everything rests on Shinji - the weak willed little indecisive introvert. I had gone through the whole series looking for him to mature and grow but in the end he is just as weak if not more so than when he started. I suppose whether we like it or not this is the end. And the way it ends lets you draw your on conclusions on what happens or what it means. The director had three shots at a decisive ending and even though ""The End"" is decisive it is also open for a great deal of interpatation.You may wish for more or for something different but I think that one of the points the show tried to get across is that life doesn't give you that (and the show stays true to that point).

It is clear that this series, for all the technological gimmicks and psuedo-Christian symbols, is ultimately a story of a family disguised as a sci-fi anime. Everyone in the family is hurt deep inside themselves and afraid of getting out of their cocoon to face reality and take it upon themselves. NERV too is a family whose partriarchal structure comes unstuck as things feminine, from the awakening of the Eva to Rei's rebellion aginst Ikari Gendo, start spewing out of everywhere.

705062,A26O0T192IBKY1,B000068OJ1,J. Alford,"[0, 1]","A number of anime TV shows get a second wind with a theatrical continuation, but the hurricane of controversy known as Evangelion wasn't satisfied with its overtly cryptic series finale. They basically set up the last two episodes of their show to act as little more than a lead on to what would eventually be the ""real ending"" to their epic saga. End Of Evangelion was shown as the fully-intended release, although this was after the complete waste of time, titled Evangelion: Death And Rebirth. Eva: D&R; was intended to be the original release, but because of budget cutbacks and time restraints, the entire production was cut back to only showing the first half-hour of End Of Eva in Eva: Rebirth, while Eva: Death was just a glorified clip show with some new footage made specifically for the film(including the chilling ""elevator scene""!). Despite its completion, End Of Eva was still done as a seperate release in both theatres and on home video, plus the film is split into two episodes, each complete with its own closing credits. Why they didn't just have both of them in a single feature is unknown, but then again this is from the same crew that included the intermission from Eva: D&R; on the actual DVD!The movie takes place after episode #24 of the TV series where Kowaru was revealed to be the last Angel, and regretablly killed by Shinji in Unit-01, although he was still able to get over his depression by ""shooting one out"" over a comatose Asuka. SEELE decides its time for them to take control of things by implenting 3rd Impact on their own, and to do that they need Unit-01. They send in special forces to NERV headquarters and start killing everyone. Misato rescues Shinji, and gets him to Unit-01, only to end up getting shot to death. Asuka lies at the bottom of the lake near NERV in Unit-02, and finally gets over her mom not being alive. She goes all Chuck Norris on the army attacking her, although they reveal the rest of the series of Evas which are all automatic. Asuka manages to stop all nine of them before her energy runs out, but the Evas have the ability to heal themselves, and pick apart Unit-02. Shinji grieves over Misato, but finally even Unit-01 has had enough of him acting like a complete pussy, and activates on its own. Shinji arrives to see Unit-02 completely destroyed, and totally freaks out. Meanwhile, Ritsuko has tried to stop Gendo from merging Rei with the giant form of the angel Lillith. Gendo kills her for her trouble, and then uses the Adam embryo inside him to begin 3rd Impact. Rei however betrays him, and chooses Shinji's wishes over his by merging with Lillith, which mutates her into a colossal giant. Rei grows to unbelievable heights and starts absorbing all the souls on Earth, everyone else has melted into goo(or LCL). Shinji is then absorbed into the giant Rei where she turns over the fate of the mankind to him. After alot of scanning over his own psyche and some pointless live-action footage, Shinji decides that he'd rather live with humanity and all its flaws. The ginormous Rei collapses, and the souls are sent back to be reincarnated, while Shinji and a resuscitated Asuka are possibly the last two people left alive on the planet.Okay, so on its own, the movie provides a much more satisfying conclusion than the actual TV ending. The animation is a serious step-up from the series, which shows in the gory action scenes, specifically Asuka's Eva fight and the entire 3rd Impact sequence. All the characters are given decent airtime, and each one gets a good exploration into their psyches, which are even more screwed up than the series ever let on. It's still very ambigious though, and really hard to piece together unless you've bothered watching it in unison with the series at least three times prior. The English dub by Manga Entertainment is pretty good and features most of the actors from the TV series, although for some stupid reason there were some unnecessary sound effects added to it like ""splats"" when someone's head would get shot off by Misato. Where the movie doesn't deliver is in the ""making plain sense"" department. The narrative is positively baffling, the use of live-action in the middle is totally out of place, and we didn't need to actually see Shinji polishing his nob to know he's f**ked up! Plus, the whole deal with who had what agenda was a huge headscratcher, as to whether SEELE is using Gendo or the other way around just gets tiring after the initial assault on NERV. The main draw of the film is to see the saga coming to a close, at least the original version. If the first one was more coherent though then they probably wouldn't have needed to do the new Evangelion film series.",3,The End?

For anime fans across the globe, this series is probably the most recognizable series ever created.  It certainly pushed the limit of Japanese animation, and it certainly put anime on the map in the U.S.  This series is brilliant.  It is the one series that has made me think of mortality.  The characters were down-right humanly complex.  Probably the most interesting group of ""people"" to hit anime.  Misato, Shinji, Rei, and Asuka are so memorable as characters.  Although you will love to hate Shinji, just because he is so realistic, and he is so weak willed, you truly want to hurt him (at least I did).  Misato is my tied for my all time favorite character, she is just simply awesome!  I loved her so much, she provided the humor and the realism of dealing with a traumatic life.  Asuka is truly a ""female dog,"" you laugh so much when she's in the scene, but is completely self-centered, yet carries around extreme trauma.  Rei is the most secretive, unexplainable character I have ever seen.  You can't describe her, because there is nothing to describe, other than she's extremely quiet, yet is protective when you least expect it.  I loved this series, mainly for the characters.  There was humor, action and plenty of DRAMA!  You can't get past the drama, but you can't help but being swept up and sucked into it.  The original ending was terrible, as all who've seen it know, it was just plain confusing and left us totally in the dark.  The new ending left me totally distraught.  I couldn't help but cry and cry and cry.  I literally yelled and screamed at my t.v., I was in such a wreck.  Don't believe me, watch it.  You'll be left totally unsatisfied, not because it was a bad ending, but because you don't want to comprehend the destruction.

Personally I take the latter viewpoint, so I approached the movie with caution. Actually I saw it on a borrowed fan-sub, which was probably a good thing since I came away disappointed. It's not that I totally hated this movie-- it's certainly more entertaining than the final two episodes-- but there's really nothing new here. If you hated the final episodes and you want this movie for a slightly more normal ending, then stay away. The first part starts kind of like a regular episode with lots of fighting, but it seems to lack any sense of build-up or emotion (the fighting is pretty cool). The second part is sort of like the last two episodes except not quite as boring (more action). It still seems mostly nonsensical or off the plot subject, though. The religious symbolism is heavier than ever before here, and I never really got the impression that it was part of the show at all. On a more technical note, the animation and artwork are good-- whether or not you like the movie this probably won't disappoint.I guess some people are just attuned to love this kind of anime. I'm not one of them, and if you hated the last two episodes there's no way you'll enjoy this.

705065,A3335LTANZCX78,B000068OJ1,John Cunningham,"[1, 1]","""The End of Evangelion"" is one of the most bizarre, but brilliant films made in any medium, be it live action or animation. Studio Gainax teamed up with the animation stuidio Production I.G in 1997 to create the theatrical conclusion to their most famous work, Neon Genesis Evangelion.Picking up right where episode 24 left off, EoE acts as an alternate ending to episodes 25 and 26, which abandoned the narrative to give the viewers an abstract view into the minds of the main characters (though the television ending may be the same story presented in the film from a different perspective). As such, this movie should not be viewed before watching the series, as you will be completely lost.The animation is beautiful in this film, a huge step up from the TV series. Two scenes in particular that I found impressive were Asuka's fight scene against the 9 Mass Production Evangelions, and the strange but beautiful take on the Apocalypse presented in the second half.This film is not suitable for younger viewers. It has many disturbing psychological themes (particularly the scene in the beginning), and the action is brutal and gory. One of the main characters is also nude for the duration of the movie, but it isn't too graphic. The film poses many questions and doesn't deliver the answers in a clear cut manner, instead allowing the viewers to come to their own conclusions. It is not for viewers who are seeking a fun blockbuster movie that doesn't require much thinking.I gave this release 4 stars due to the poor video transfer on the DVD. It looks fine, but compared to the release from Japan, it's lacking.

705067,AUS2EQT4NU3BF,B000068OJ1,"Jonathon Turner ""Jon Turner""","[10, 11]","So is it really worth all the hype?  The frustrated answer seems to be yes and no.  Advertised as the definitive conclusion to this dense, complicated TV series, THE END OF EVANGELION *does* provide answers to some of the many questions we have during the show, and offers some of the most impressive visuals I've ever seen in any movie.  The animation is spectacular, particularly during the climactic sequences, and, although seemingly out-of-place in an animated movie, the integration of live-action sequences are beautifully shot and edited.  If anything, the movie is like a tour-de-force as an experiment in visual cinematography.As incredible as the visuals are, however, they seem to be the only real prize of this movie.  The storyline really could have used some work.  As mentioned, this film ties up some of the more loose ends of the story, but the overall production feels every bit as disjointed, confusing, and unconventional as the original ""finale"" of the show.I really don't know what to think about this film, except that, if this is Hideaki Anno's personal work, then I think he must be a very tormented and conflicted artist himself.  He has a lot of talent and interesting concepts for art -- as mentioned, the visuals are incredible in the movie -- but he seems to have a screwed up view of the world.  He also must have had trouble deciding how he REALLY wanted to resolve the conflicts in this puzzling tale of his, as this picture is incredibly dense and interpretative.  It almost appears, to me at least, that he is almost like the Stanley Kubrick of Anime -- a talented artist who conjures visual tricks out of his magic bag while leaving us with a rather mind-bending plot.As an expressive form of art, this film (and the series, no doubt) is exceptional and brilliant, but for others expecting a cohesive and clear storyline, this will probably leave you in the dark.  This is not to say that EVANGELION is bad -- it isn't, but it feels disjointed and strangely incomplete.  Still, the cast of characters are interesting and believable, and this picture's music by Shiro Sagisu is probably his best ever -- he features a chanting chorus and some of the most passionate melodies I've ever heard from a composer who occasionally churns out bland compositions.  In that sense, EVANGELION is more like a case of artists expressing themselves -- their strengths and weaknesses -- in ways that we, the audience, may not always understand.The DVD, like the film, seems to be every bit as flawed.  Produced by MANGA ENTERTAINMENT, who also released EVANGELION:  DEATH & REBIRTH, the presentation is uneven.  Again, the audio mixing on the English dub is not as good as on the Japanese language track, and, strangely, the Japanese trailer for the film is featured BEFORE the movie itself begins.  (What happened?  Were the DVD producers on drugs?)  There were a lot of extras promised, but unfortunately, they never made it.  All that's available is an enjoyable commentary track by Amanda Winn Lee - voice of Rei and director of English dub - and voice talents Jason Lee and Taliesin Jaffe.The dub itself is good for the most part; the actors give their best performances ever, but many fans complained about the addition of sound effects from the crew.  This didn't bother my mom when we viewed it together (she, like myself, is not as rabid or picky as some Anime fans seem to be), but the ""sploosh"" sound effects feel out-of-place with the rest of the film.  Thankfully, this doesn't occur often, but it's an oddity that doesn't exist on the Japanese language track.For an improvement, though, there are 6.1, 5.1, and 2.0 tracks for both English and Japanese, which should satisfy fans.  But it's weird that the disc itself appears to be a double-sided DVD when in reality it is not.I'm not saying that this is a waste of time at all; the movie is worth a look for its incredible visuals, but it's best to be warned -- this is a very dark, depressing movie, and the DVD feels disjointed.  It's probably best to keep these factors in mind before deciding to dive into a web of puzzles and visual splendor.",3,Impressive visuals; depressing and very confusing storyline.,1049587200,"04 6, 2003",2003,4132,"['So', 'really', 'hype', 'frustrated', 'answer', 'be', 'yes', 'Advertised', 'definitive', 'conclusion', 'dense', 'complicated', 'TV', 'series', 'THE', 'END', 'OF', 'EVANGELION', '*does*', 'provide', 'answers', 'many', 'questions', 'have', 'show', 'most', 'impressive', 'visuals', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'animation', 'spectacular', 'particularly', 'climactic', 'sequences', 'seemingly', 'out-of-place', 'animated', 'movie', 'integration', 'live-action', 'sequences', 'are', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'edited', 'anything', 'movie', 'tour-de-force', 'experiment', 'visual', 'cinematography.As', 'incredible', 'visuals', 'are', 'however', 'seem', 'be', 'only', 'real', 'prize', 'movie', 'storyline', 'really', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'work', 'mentioned', 'film', 'up', 'more', 'loose', 'ends', 'story', 'overall', 'production', 'feels', 'bit', 'disjointed', 'confusing', 'unconventional', 'original', 'finale', 'show.I', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'think', 'film', 'Hideaki', 'Anno', 'personal', 'work', 'then', 'think', 'must', 'be', 'very', 'tormented', 'conflicted', 'artist', 'lot', 'talent', 'interesting', 'concepts', 'art', 'mentioned', 'visuals', 'are', 'incredible', 'movie', 'have', 'screwed', 'up', 'view', 'world', 'also', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'trouble', 'deciding', 'how', 'REALLY', 'wanted', 'resolve', 'conflicts', 'puzzling', 'tale', 'picture', 'incredibly', 'dense', 'interpretative', 'almost', 'least', 'almost', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'Anime', 'talented', 'artist', 'who', 'visual', 'tricks', 'magic', 'bag', 'leaving', 'rather', 'mind-bending', 'plot.As', 'expressive', 'form', 'art', 'film', 'series', 'doubt', 'exceptional', 'brilliant', 'others', 'expecting', 'cohesive', 'clear', 'storyline', 'will', 'probably', 'leave', 'dark', 'not', 'say', 'EVANGELION', 'bad', ""n't"", 'disjointed', 'strangely', 'incomplete', 'Still', 'cast', 'characters', 'are', 'interesting', 'believable', 'picture', 'music', 'Shiro', 'Sagisu', 'probably', 'best', 'ever', 'chanting', 'chorus', 'most', 'passionate', 'melodies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'composer', 'who', 'occasionally', 'out', 'bland', 'compositions', 'sense', 'EVANGELION', 'more', 'case', 'artists', 'expressing', 'strengths', 'weaknesses', 'ways', 'audience', 'may', 'not', 'always', 'understand.The', 'DVD', 'film', 'be', 'bit', 'flawed', 'Produced', 'MANGA', 'ENTERTAINMENT', 'who', 'also', 'released', 'EVANGELION', 'DEATH', 'REBIRTH', 'presentation', 'uneven', 'Again', 'audio', 'mixing', 'English', 'dub', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'Japanese', 'language', 'track', 'strangely', 'Japanese', 'trailer', 'film', 'featured', 'movie', 'What', 'happened', 'Were', 'DVD', 'producers', 'drugs', 'were', 'lot', 'extras', 'promised', 'unfortunately', 'never', 'made', 'available', 'enjoyable', 'commentary', 'track', 'Amanda', 'Winn', 'Lee', 'voice', 'Rei', 'director', 'English', 'dub', 'voice', 'talents', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'Taliesin', 'Jaffe.The', 'dub', 'good', 'most', 'part', 'actors', 'give', 'best', 'performances', 'ever', 'many', 'fans', 'complained', 'addition', 'sound', 'effects', 'crew', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'mom', 'when', 'viewed', 'together', 'not', 'rabid', 'picky', 'Anime', 'fans', 'seem', 'be', 'sploosh', 'sound', 'effects', 'feel', 'out-of-place', 'rest', 'film', 'Thankfully', ""n't"", 'occur', 'often', 'oddity', ""n't"", 'exist', 'Japanese', 'language', 'track.For', 'improvement', 'though', 'are', '6.1', '5.1', '2.0', 'tracks', 'English', 'Japanese', 'should', 'satisfy', 'fans', 'weird', 'disc', 'be', 'double-sided', 'DVD', 'when', 'reality', 'not.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'waste', 'time', 'movie', 'look', 'incredible', 'visuals', 'best', 'be', 'warned', 'very', 'dark', 'depressing', 'movie', 'DVD', 'feels', 'disjointed', 'probably', 'best', 'keep', 'factors', 'mind', 'deciding', 'dive', 'web', 'puzzles', 'visual', 'splendor']",N/A

Imagine, if you can, Princess Mononoke, Mobile Suit Gundam Wing, Godzilla, The Holy Bible and a couple Greek tragedies all combined and you have a rudimentary framework of Evangelion. I apologize if that seems convoluted but that's what Evangelion is. A confusing dead sea scroll with a variety of interpretations.

705069,A19ETXGQCPSWPA,B000068OJ1,JVosh,"[11, 20]","End of Evangelion was an interesting end to the series but I have to admit it left me with a very hollow feeling. The series as a whole had the same impact/ effect. It started off very, very, strong, one of the best anime series I've seen in fact. But, about midway through it started to unravel and devolve into a whiny teenager that cries and moans for the entire rest of the series.While most of the characters show personality and growth as people throughout the series, the main character (Shinji) continues his pervasive whining and crying up to the bitter end while showing no development other than to be very, very, annoying to the point where I don't care about his mental state or what he feels, I just want him to shut up, stop whining/crying (whatever he's doing during that particular episode/scene), or do *anything* but complain and mope.The antithesis of the ""plot"" - and I use that word very loosely - is that Shinji not only can't recognize that the people in his life care for him, but he rejects them constantly while at the same time screaming that no one cares for him. Tragic? I suppose, but the fact that nothing about him - his personality, his thought process, etc... - changes from episode one to the final scene in this movie really is really telling. So in the end when he has to choose between saving the world and destroying it, he opts for the latter due to the fact that he can't cope with human emotions. What really dropped the enjoyment factor of this movie is that throughout the whole of it Shinji, save the final few scenes, was either crying, screaming, whining, or acting totally comatose while destruction was raining down around him and the rest of the characters (whom were all subsequently killed) were trying to do something or fighting through their issues and problems and growing/ evolving as people.At the end there's some answers... more if you look at the imagery, remember back to some instances in the series, and think about the theology and the symbolism, but when it's all said and done, the movie did little more then to kill off all of the characters that actually did grow and evolve as people during the series and reveal Shinji as an emotionally stunted and perverted character that was left to determine the fate of the entire race.",2,"Interesting, but not a masterpiece",1065398400,"10 6, 2003",2003,2296,"['End', 'Evangelion', 'was', 'interesting', 'end', 'series', 'have', 'admit', 'left', 'very', 'hollow', 'feeling', 'series', 'whole', 'had', 'same', 'impact/', 'effect', 'started', 'off', 'very', 'very', 'strong', 'one', 'best', 'anime', 'series', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'fact', 'about', 'midway', 'started', 'unravel', 'devolve', 'whiny', 'teenager', 'cries', 'moans', 'entire', 'rest', 'series.While', 'most', 'characters', 'show', 'personality', 'growth', 'people', 'series', 'main', 'character', 'Shinji', 'pervasive', 'whining', 'crying', 'up', 'bitter', 'end', 'showing', 'development', 'other', 'be', 'very', 'very', 'annoying', 'point', 'where', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'mental', 'state', 'what', 'just', 'want', 'shut', 'up', 'stop', 'whining/crying', 'doing', 'particular', 'episode/scene', 'do', '*anything*', 'complain', 'mope.The', 'antithesis', 'plot', 'use', 'word', 'very', 'loosely', 'Shinji', 'not', 'only', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'people', 'life', 'care', 'constantly', 'same', 'time', 'screaming', 'one', 'Tragic', 'suppose', 'fact', 'nothing', 'personality', 'thought', 'process', 'etc', 'changes', 'episode', 'one', 'final', 'scene', 'movie', 'really', 'really', 'telling', 'So', 'end', 'when', 'choose', 'saving', 'world', 'destroying', 'latter', 'due', 'fact', 'ca', ""n't"", 'cope', 'human', 'emotions', 'What', 'really', 'dropped', 'enjoyment', 'factor', 'movie', 'whole', 'Shinji', 'save', 'final', 'few', 'scenes', 'was', 'either', 'crying', 'screaming', 'whining', 'acting', 'totally', 'comatose', 'destruction', 'was', 'raining', 'down', 'rest', 'characters', 'whom', 'were', 'subsequently', 'killed', 'were', 'trying', 'do', 'something', 'fighting', 'issues', 'problems', 'growing/', 'evolving', 'people.At', 'end', 'answers', 'more', 'look', 'imagery', 'remember', 'back', 'instances', 'series', 'think', 'theology', 'symbolism', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'movie', 'did', 'little', 'more', 'then', 'kill', 'off', 'characters', 'actually', 'did', 'grow', 'evolve', 'people', 'series', 'reveal', 'Shinji', 'emotionally', 'stunted', 'perverted', 'character', 'was', 'left', 'determine', 'fate', 'entire', 'race']",N/A

It's jampacked with random violence, graphic sexual content, and an overall morbid effect. I'm not going to say it wasn't good, it was just weird. Although it follows the Evangelion storyline, it seems to have little to do with the creator's original intentions. It seems as though Hideaki Anno was slowly having a mental breakdown as he made the series, if you have seen the original series you would know that it starts off like any typical anime and becomes more and more twisted as it moves along. I would recommend this movie for anyone who has seen the original series and would like to have more questions answered. Beyond the bad stuff, there are, of course, some good points.

It ties up most of the loose ends left by the series' original finale.  However, the end of this movie isn't much more forthcoming in explaining itself than the series' end was.  It was more physical, perhaps, but still not satisfying enough in my opinion.  There's closure here, no doubt, but not the kind I was hoping for.Luckily the disk has an amusing and interesting commentary from 3 individuals who worked on the show.  It's a godsend because it explains a great deal of the movie's bizarre imagery.  Without that commentary I would have been lost in trying to understand some of the key plot developments.I really liked the overall quality of this film.  You can tell the production values were higher here than in the series because the animation is a significant step up.  And geez, talk about graphic!  Unless you're terribly desensitized to violence and gore, be prepared for some harsh visuals!  The action sequences are brutal, yet gratifying at the same time.  The music was mostly impressive but towards the end it gets strange.  It sounds kind of odd considering the events during which it plays.  You'll just have to listen (and see) for yourself.This film entertains while making you feel for the characters.  For that reason alone it is a success.

705073,A28FIXTN3E0ALY,B000068OJ1,"K. Gray ""you know, that guy""","[10, 12]","This film is a rarity in the world of film making and in TV production.  The first important thing to note is that you will never be able to fully appreciate this film until you've seen the TV series - this has been touched on by others, but it truly is important.  The film compliments the final two episodes of the series, and was a labor of love for the creator of the series as well as many dedicated production companies who helped it get made (look at the list of credits!  I think it's the entire population of Japan!).While the last 2 episodes of the series eschew the Eva action scenes of earlier eps (a necessary evil...the production team completely ran out of money), they unravel the workings of the mind in an absolutely brilliant way.  It was basically a self-help guide for viewers, showing them the way towards happiness and fulfillment.  Plus, it was nice to see Shinji stand up for himself for once.  However, as an end to a series, it fell short.  What IS the Human Instrumentality Project?  How was the plan initialized?  What the hell happened to all of the characters we got to know?  They wanted to show us, but they knew they couldn't in such a small time span and with so little money.  Luckily, we've got this movie.And what a movie it is.  On visuals alone, it stands above practically every animated or live action film I've ever seen.  The imagery and the symbolism (especially in the last half of the movie) is amazing and would cause a theologian's brain to explode.  The film combines animation and live action, as well as interesting filming techniques like producing animation to look like it was filmed with an 8mm camera.  There are important reasons for all of this.  It is to create mood, moods that range from fear, hopelessness, loneliness, to utter ecstacy.  It's a movie with religious symbols and religious names that, when you watch it, feels like a religious experience.  But in a strange way, it has nothing to do with religion at all.The main focus of both the series and the film is on the self; filling in the holes in each one of our souls with parts of each other, and identity and how it requires human interaction (in spite of how painful it may be for some) to be formed.  In short, this film comes closer to explaining the meaning of life than anything I think I've ever seen.  Wow, what a statement!All of this would mean nothing, however, if we didn't care about the characters, or if the movie was boring.  Neither of these are true.  All of the characters, whether it be Shinji, Asuka, Misato, whoever, are people you can relate to in a very true way.  They are all flawed.  No one is a ""hero"" in this film, no one is completely virtuous.  This is another brilliant aspect of this story: these humans attempt to become God while blind to their inherent problems.The action scenes in the first half of the film more than make up for the lack of it in the latter episodes of the series.  To see one of the main characters we've cheered on for so long finally kick some ass is a beautiful thing (until we're brought back down to earth in the most painful of ways).  It's in part 2 of the movie that the visuals become overwhelming, however.  I never thought the end of the world could be so beautiful.The music?  Perfect.  That's all I'll say, because I've rambled on too much.You know, for a guy who is not much of an anime fan and who is in no strong way a religious person, it's pretty amazing that a movie like this can affect me so much.  All I can say is, watch the entire series first.  Buy it, borrow it, I don't care.  Get through the slow beginning episodes, stare dumbfounded at the confusing ending, and then watch the movie.

Furthermore, some of the original character plots (as I like to think of them) are concluded, such as Gendo's ongoing connection with Rei and Ritsuko, and Shinji's attraction to Asuka and Misato.  In all truthfulness, I couldn't have asked for a better conclusion to an already phenomenal series.  The first episode was perhaps one of the most appropriately-violent pieces of anime I've ever seen--because Evangelion really couldn't have ended any other way--and the second episode contained enough weirdness to be true to the original, but was actually much more self-explanatory.

705077,A1EEG7YJIYN60B,B000068OJ1,Lesley Aeschliman,"[1, 2]","The End of Evangelion is divided into two approximately 45-minute episodes.  The first is ""Episode 25': Love is Destructive,"" and the second is ""Episode 26': ONE MORE FINAL: I need you.""  These ""episodes"" can be seen either as a kind of ""replacement"" for the original ending of the Neon Genesis Evangelion anime series, or as a more detailed ""real world"" account of the ending of the original series.""Episode 25"" opens with Shjinji Akari still mourning the death of Kaworu Nagisa, and he is pleading with an unconscious Asuka Langley Soryu for help.  Meanwhile, SEELE attempts to take over NERV by hacking into the MAGI computer system; however, their efforts are thwarted by Ritsuko Akagi, who installs a firewall program that SEELE cannot penetrate.  SEELE manages to convince the Prime Minister of Japan to deploy the JSSDF to conduct a large-scale assault on NERV.  The JSSDF soldiers are given permission to kill NERV personnel on sight, to execute the Eva pilots, and capture the Evangelions.  A lot of the story of this episode focuses on what happens during the assault on NERV.  In addition, Dr. Gendo Ikari takes Rei to Terminal Dogma to initiate the Third Impact.In ""Episode 26,"" Gendo tries to merge with Rei to begin the Third Impact, but Rei takes over the process and reunites with Lilith.  This episode focuses on what happens after Rei's merge with Lilith, and the interactions that Rei/Lilith have with Shinji.Overall, I have to say that this film was rather strange.  Also, by the time I reached the end of this piece, it felt as if Shinji and Asuka had never really evolved, even though they went through some major events that really should have brought about some kind of a noticeable change.  Also, the ending of this film really doesn't ""end.""  Perhaps someone who is more of a die-hard fan of Neon Genesis Evangelion series would have a greater appreciation for this than I do.As for the visual content, there is definitely more blood and nudity than in the anime series.  It's a film that I would only recommend to anime viewers who are seventeen or eighteen years of age and older who already have familiarity with the Neon Genesis Evangelion franchise.As for the DVD, it should be noted that while it looks like it should be a double-sided disc, there appears to only be content on one side of the disc.  The DVD provides six audio options: Japanese 2.0, Japanese 5.1 Dolby Digital EX, Japanese 6.1 dts es, English 2.0, English 5.1 Dolby Digital EX, and English 6.1 dts es.  For subtitles, you can choose English Titling, English, and None.There are a few bonus features included on this release.  The first is an audio commentary provided by Amanda Win Lee, Jason Lee, and Taliesan Jaffe.  The next feature is labeled as ""Evangelion Trailers,"" and it runs for two minutes and thirty-nine seconds.  There are two English language trailers included: one is for The End of Evangelion, and the other is for Death and Rebirth.The final extra is labeled as ""Manga Extras,"" which takes you to a menu with several options.  The ""Manga Video Previews"" is ten minutes and nine seconds of trailers, which starts automatically when you select that menu option.  ""Manga DVD Catalogue"" has a menu that allows you to select from the items listed on the screen.  ""Merchandising and Catalogue Info"" is a slideshow that runs for two minutes.  ""Websites"" lists the links for Manga Entertainment, Sputnik 7, and Palm Pictures.  You can also select the icons for Palm Pictures or Sputnik 7 that appear on the screen to see a promotional piece for those entities.In some respects, the bonus features may not seem like much on the surface.  However, when I realized that there are other anime DVD releases on the market that include even less than this, it makes these features seem a little more impressive to me than they might have otherwise.I would only recommend this DVD for die-hard fans of the Neon Genesis Evangelion anime series.  However, this DVD is now out of print in North America; the only way to find it is to look at stores and websites that sell used DVDs.I wrote this review after watching a copy of this DVD that I checked out through the King County Library System.",3,The movie that ended the Neon Genesis Evangelion series,1330992000,"03 6, 2012",2012,4193,"['End', 'Evangelion', 'divided', 'two', 'approximately', '45-minute', 'episodes', 'first', 'Episode', '25', 'Love', 'Destructive', 'second', 'Episode', '26', 'ONE', 'MORE', 'FINAL', 'need', 'episodes', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'kind', 'replacement', 'original', 'ending', 'Neon', 'Genesis', 'Evangelion', 'anime', 'series', 'more', 'detailed', 'real', 'world', 'account', 'ending', 'original', 'series', 'Episode', '25', 'opens', 'Shjinji', 'Akari', 'still', 'mourning', 'death', 'Kaworu', 'Nagisa', 'pleading', 'unconscious', 'Asuka', 'Langley', 'Soryu', 'help', 'Meanwhile', 'SEELE', 'take', 'over', 'NERV', 'hacking', 'MAGI', 'computer', 'system', 'however', 'efforts', 'are', 'thwarted', 'Ritsuko', 'Akagi', 'who', 'firewall', 'program', 'SEELE', 'can', 'not', 'penetrate', 'SEELE', 'convince', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Japan', 'deploy', 'JSSDF', 'conduct', 'large-scale', 'assault', 'NERV', 'JSSDF', 'soldiers', 'are', 'given', 'permission', 'kill', 'NERV', 'personnel', 'sight', 'execute', 'Eva', 'pilots', 'capture', 'Evangelions', 'lot', 'story', 'episode', 'what', 'assault', 'NERV', 'addition', 'Dr.', 'Gendo', 'Ikari', 'Rei', 'Terminal', 'Dogma', 'initiate', 'Third', 'Impact.In', 'Episode', '26', 'Gendo', 'merge', 'Rei', 'begin', 'Third', 'Impact', 'Rei', 'process', 'Lilith', 'episode', 'what', 'Rei', 'merge', 'Lilith', 'interactions', 'Rei/Lilith', 'have', 'Shinji.Overall', 'have', 'say', 'film', 'was', 'rather', 'strange', 'Also', 'time', 'reached', 'end', 'piece', 'felt', 'Shinji', 'Asuka', 'had', 'never', 'really', 'evolved', 'even', 'went', 'major', 'events', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'brought', 'about', 'kind', 'noticeable', 'change', 'Also', 'ending', 'film', 'really', ""n't"", 'end', 'Perhaps', 'someone', 'who', 'more', 'die-hard', 'fan', 'Neon', 'Genesis', 'Evangelion', 'series', 'would', 'have', 'greater', 'appreciation', 'do.As', 'visual', 'content', 'definitely', 'more', 'blood', 'nudity', 'anime', 'series', 'film', 'would', 'only', 'recommend', 'anime', 'viewers', 'who', 'are', 'seventeen', 'eighteen', 'years', 'age', 'older', 'who', 'already', 'have', 'familiarity', 'Neon', 'Genesis', 'Evangelion', 'franchise.As', 'DVD', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'should', 'be', 'double-sided', 'disc', 'only', 'be', 'content', 'one', 'side', 'disc', 'DVD', 'six', 'audio', 'options', 'Japanese', '2.0', 'Japanese', '5.1', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'EX', 'Japanese', '6.1', 'dts', 'es', 'English', '2.0', 'English', '5.1', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'EX', 'English', '6.1', 'dts', 'es', 'subtitles', 'can', 'choose', 'English', 'Titling', 'English', 'None.There', 'are', 'few', 'bonus', 'features', 'included', 'release', 'first', 'audio', 'commentary', 'provided', 'Amanda', 'Win', 'Lee', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'Taliesan', 'Jaffe', 'next', 'feature', 'labeled', 'Evangelion', 'Trailers', 'two', 'minutes', 'thirty-nine', 'seconds', 'are', 'two', 'English', 'language', 'trailers', 'included', 'one', 'End', 'Evangelion', 'other', 'Death', 'Rebirth.The', 'final', 'extra', 'labeled', 'Manga', 'Extras', 'menu', 'several', 'options', 'Manga', 'Video', 'Previews', 'ten', 'minutes', 'nine', 'seconds', 'trailers', 'automatically', 'when', 'select', 'menu', 'option', 'Manga', 'DVD', 'Catalogue', 'menu', 'select', 'items', 'listed', 'screen', 'Merchandising', 'Catalogue', 'Info', 'slideshow', 'two', 'minutes', 'Websites', 'links', 'Manga', 'Entertainment', 'Sputnik', '7', 'Palm', 'Pictures', 'can', 'also', 'select', 'icons', 'Palm', 'Pictures', 'Sputnik', '7', 'appear', 'screen', 'see', 'promotional', 'piece', 'entities.In', 'respects', 'bonus', 'features', 'may', 'not', 'seem', 'much', 'surface', 'However', 'when', 'realized', 'are', 'other', 'anime', 'DVD', 'releases', 'market', 'include', 'even', 'less', 'features', 'seem', 'little', 'more', 'impressive', 'might', 'have', 'otherwise.I', 'would', 'only', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'Neon', 'Genesis', 'Evangelion', 'anime', 'series', 'However', 'DVD', 'now', 'print', 'North', 'America', 'only', 'way', 'find', 'look', 'stores', 'sell', 'used', 'DVDs.I', 'wrote', 'review', 'watching', 'copy', 'DVD', 'checked', 'out', 'King', 'County', 'Library', 'System']",N/A

End of Evangelion was a result after the fan-donated Death and Rebirth ran in theaters. Even though it is used to replace the last two episodes in the series, it's still a great movie.The film is pretty much explaining everything you've seen in the last two episodes of Evangelion, except there is more action and imagery to describe it better. Now I have had common knowledge of the film before it was released in the US. I've read the script and everything, but this is one anime title that can't be appreciated through the script alone. It has to be seen to be beleived. The movie deals with what all humans fear: The end of the world.Much of the film won't make sense to anyone who is not familiar with psychology or philosophy, but for fans of the series, it should be impressive to watch all your characters get down and dirty right to the core. In a way, its almost one of the scariest anime films ever created. Filled with frightening and violent imagery, End of Evangelion pretty much breaks the barriers of the original series. And get ready to see a lot of Rei.The audio for this title was done with extreme care for the fans. It comes in 5.1 EX, 6.1 DTS and 2.0 Stereo in both English and Japanese. Plus, there is the option of audio commentary by the English cast (continued from Rebirth) where they make many comments of Evangelion relating to the Bible, Babylonian mythology and much more. Very helpful for those confused. With the exception of the audio commentary and trailers, there are no other extras on this disc. However, I am still impressed with the menus. I thought nothing could topple the Death and Rebirth disc and after I saw the End of Evangelion title menu, I was wrong.Overall, End of Evangelion is a very deep film that should speak to pretty much anyone out there.

The first ending (Episodes 25 and 26) left fans so dissatisfied that director Hideaki Anno felt compelled to create an alternate ending and issue it as a full length film.  One should keep in mind when watching it that in the voice commentary provided in this edition this film is referred to as ""Hideaki's revenge.""  I really do not think that is true, but there is no question but that the Director/Creator of this film has made a film that challenges the view on all fronts, making it an unusually difficult film.The film opens on the impending destruction of NERV headquarters.  With the destruction of the 'Angels,' the members of SEELE move to implement their plan for the forced evolution of humankind.  Stage 1 is the capture or destruction of the EVA and their 'riders.'  For the rest of the NERV staff only a grim and violent death is offered.  Shinji and Asuka manage to activate their EVAs and fight back.  Meanwhile, Rei descends into the heart of NERV with Dr. Ikari to confront Lilith.While this apocalypse occupies the first part of the film, filling the screen with both spellbinding action and some unnerving interior insights, one could argue that it is only a prelude to the real core of the film.  Almost haphazardly, symbols from the Kabbala and the Crucifixion are woven into the action as SEELE prepares the ritual that will recreate humanity.  Magically, Rei and Shinji become the main characters in a metaphysical play that will decide the future of man.  It is no surprise that these two become bound to the moments of decision and rebirth.  Both the characters are not completely whole as personalities.  To each of them the conflict over individuality is both interior and exterior.  Without these flaws, the decision would not have been in doubt.As the story progresses fluid, the hurried action of the attack on NERV is replaced by a more elegiac pace.  Longer still shifts and slower pacing give the viewer a rest, but at the price of an ever more complex and difficult plot.  Without the film length commentary available on the DVD, much of the subtexts to the visual displays would remain impenetrable.  This is the first time that I have felt that the commentary was required viewing.  This film is worth seeing simply for its stretching of the limitations of anime.  This is a marvelous but elusive work of art.  Be warned - 'The End of Evangelion' lacks any manner of explanation of the events leading up to the film.  Thus, familiarity with either 'Death and Rebirth' or the series itself is almost a requirement for making good sense of what is happening.",5,"Brilliant in Concept, Complex in Execution",1035072000,"10 20, 2002",2002,2652,"['film', 'second', 'ending', 'produced', 'series', 'first', 'ending', 'Episodes', '25', '26', 'left', 'fans', 'so', 'dissatisfied', 'director', 'Hideaki', 'Anno', 'felt', 'compelled', 'create', 'alternate', 'ending', 'issue', 'full', 'length', 'film', 'One', 'should', 'keep', 'mind', 'when', 'watching', 'voice', 'commentary', 'provided', 'edition', 'film', 'referred', 'Hideaki', 'revenge', 'really', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'true', 'question', 'Director/Creator', 'film', 'made', 'film', 'view', 'fronts', 'making', 'unusually', 'difficult', 'film.The', 'film', 'impending', 'destruction', 'NERV', 'headquarters', 'destruction', ""'Angels"", 'members', 'SEELE', 'move', 'implement', 'plan', 'forced', 'evolution', 'humankind', 'Stage', '1', 'capture', 'destruction', 'EVA', ""'riders"", 'rest', 'NERV', 'staff', 'only', 'grim', 'violent', 'death', 'offered', 'Shinji', 'Asuka', 'manage', 'activate', 'EVAs', 'fight', 'back', 'Meanwhile', 'Rei', 'heart', 'NERV', 'Dr.', 'Ikari', 'confront', 'Lilith.While', 'apocalypse', 'first', 'part', 'film', 'filling', 'screen', 'spellbinding', 'action', 'unnerving', 'interior', 'insights', 'one', 'could', 'argue', 'only', 'prelude', 'real', 'core', 'film', 'Almost', 'haphazardly', 'symbols', 'Kabbala', 'Crucifixion', 'are', 'woven', 'action', 'SEELE', 'ritual', 'will', 'recreate', 'humanity', 'Magically', 'Rei', 'Shinji', 'become', 'main', 'characters', 'metaphysical', 'play', 'will', 'decide', 'future', 'man', 'surprise', 'two', 'become', 'bound', 'moments', 'decision', 'rebirth', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'completely', 'whole', 'personalities', 'conflict', 'individuality', 'interior', 'exterior', 'flaws', 'decision', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'doubt.As', 'story', 'fluid', 'hurried', 'action', 'attack', 'NERV', 'replaced', 'more', 'elegiac', 'pace', 'Longer', 'still', 'shifts', 'slower', 'pacing', 'give', 'viewer', 'rest', 'price', 'ever', 'more', 'complex', 'difficult', 'plot', 'film', 'length', 'commentary', 'available', 'DVD', 'much', 'subtexts', 'visual', 'displays', 'would', 'remain', 'impenetrable', 'first', 'time', 'have', 'felt', 'commentary', 'was', 'required', 'viewing', 'film', 'seeing', 'simply', 'stretching', 'limitations', 'anime', 'marvelous', 'elusive', 'work', 'art', 'Be', 'warned', ""'The"", 'End', 'Evangelion', 'lacks', 'manner', 'explanation', 'events', 'leading', 'up', 'film', 'Thus', 'familiarity', ""'Death"", 'Rebirth', 'series', 'almost', 'requirement', 'making', 'good', 'sense', 'what', 'happening']",N/A
705082,AAF5WKYQLG7CJ,B000068OJ1,Matthews,"[1, 1]",I first have to say Neon Genisis Evangelion is one of the most complex anime ever in my life and End of Evanglion is no different. I have seen both the whole t.v series and the death and rebirth DVD but end of evangelion is pretty more straight forward with the story. It starts of with Shinji right next to Asuka which is in some kind of coma. I am not going to spoil anything but there is a lot adult content. A scene in this movie when Asuka's eva UNIT 02 was teared apart it was just completly sickining especially when Asuka feel's every little pain that deals with the eva. What I am really trying to say is that this movie is disturbing and may make you dizzy in some parts and this is also a bit confusing soooooo.. I suggest you get the other one &quot;Death and Rebirth&quot; before you get this. This is a great movie but I don't really reccomend very much only get this if you are 13 or older because this anime DVD is really messed up but good in a anime collection.P.S.

705084,A2AZIQIDECJ4I8,B000068OJ1,Michael Wood,"[6, 12]","I bought a bootleg copy of End of Evangelion a couple of months ago and read the English script online, so I am qualified to write this review.  To make the biggest clarification, episodes 25 & 26 are both about instrumentality yes, but absolutely DO NOT end in the same manner.  The outcome for Shinji is DRASTICALLY different, no spoilers.  To be honest, the series of Evangelion is the best thing I have ever seen.  It's shocking portrayal of humanity and incredible action scenes kept me riveted for months.  But, I could not stand episodes 25 & 26.  The psychological viewpoints Anno throws on us like the belief that others around us create the image that we call self make me croak.  While this may be true, Anno states that if no one else was around, our image of self would dissappear.  He also states that we can change our viewpoint on reality and just be happy if we change our perspective.  I'm sorry but this is all flawed theory.End of Evangelion, while maybe being Anno's hate letter to fans, is a much more enjoyable and CLEARLY THOUGHT OUT ending.  I bought Death & Rebirth just the other day and I must praise Manga highly for the care they gave my beloved series.  Who cares if French and Spanish aren't included, the original Japanese is what the series should be viewed in.  Even so, the English voice acting has improved, dare I say.  Even Tiffany Grant, the unbearable English voice of Asuka improved to listenable quality.  Still, the Japanese voices are far superior.Without giving away whole plot lines like some reviewers, let's just say you'll want to buy this DVD to see one particular EVA battle.  The animation is beautiful and some of the computer added effects are jaw dropping.  The only problems I have with the plot is that Anno uses real live video in one of Shinji's mind babbling scenes.  I hate when director's meld fantasy with reality.  I thought the way in which it was done was distasteful.Anyway, this movie will not give you closure.  In fact, if we set up a web-site and everybody wrote in how they wanted Eva to end, I bet every single person's response would be different.  I do consider this movie to be one of the greatest works in not just animation but in entertainment.

First, watch the Neon Genesis Evangelion series, and then watch this, since without having watched the series, this won't make any sense at all.  As others have said, this film was to originally be episodes 25 and 26 of the series, but there's no way this could have been broadcast on TV - due to violence and nudity, it should probably be rated R.  So, new scripts were written for the broadcast TV episodes 25 and 26, providing the so-called ""internal, psychological"" ending to the series, which happens inside Shiji's head.  This movie provides the so-called ""external"" ending, what's taking place in the outside world.  Well, for the most part.  The first half of the film, the new (or actually the original) episode 25 shows Seele attacking the Nerv base, Misato convincing Shinji to pilot Eva 01 once again, and Asuka fighting the mass production Evas.  However...Watching the second half is where your mind will begin to melt.  Rei becomes unified with Adam, then Lilith, then Kaworu, then Shinji, and then the entire human race.  The fate of the human race is in Shinji's hands.  Uh oh.Anime like this one might be bewildering due to errors in translation.

705089,A37G6UPLDGH81P,B000068OJ1,"Ookami ""daronin""","[11, 11]","Evangelion was a series that had its fair share of wierdness and religous themes.  Originally the director, Hdieki Anno Meant these themes to be a sort of backstory, the last two episodes of Evangelion were episodes that very literally, delved into the thoughts and feelings of the main characters... and ended with the off camera, end of the world, and the subsequent long awaited maturing of series protagonist, shinji Ikari.Most Fans were less then pleased with the End of the world not being animated.  But Anno wished for the end, to focus on shinji, not the appoccalypse.  But Fans demanded The appoccalypse be animated in a movie or ova, lest they come for Anno's head.As The old Saying goes, Be careful for what you wish for.  End of Evangelion Was made, And the fans were... Confused.  Some hated the movie and wanted it to burn.  Others loved it and found it to be the perfect end too the series.  And many more, Just didnt know what to think, and chalked it up too too much drug use on Anno's part.The film is not for the faint of heart.  I have long referred too this DVD as ""THE WIDOWMAKER""; in the sense it is the DVD I show too casual anime fans too ascertain whether they will become hardcore.  Those that finish watching it, and honestly say they understood, and even slightly appreciated what happened, become hardcore anime fans.  Others make it up too the crucifixan of EVA 01 and the end of the world before they go pray to the porcelain god.The opening scene is a Shell shocked shinji, desparately looking for comfort, masterbating over a catatonic Asuka.  Then there was a falling out between Nerve and Seele, which results in Nerv falling under seige.  As seele tries too recapture the Eva's from Gendo, In the process, Asuka will recover, Fight to the death with Eva models 5-13; Shinji will continue to be desteibly whiny and self loathing.  And Fans will finally be able too see the long postponed, end of the world.  So whats the problem?!?!Problem is I kinda gotta agree with people thinking Anno Was on drugs making this film.  Some of these images will literally shock you to the point where you wont be able to think for at least a day.  The appoccalypse combines biblical prophesy, with fiction and sciance.  And the result is The most Out there animated sequance I have ever seen in my long years of watching anime.  the merging of biblical prophesy with science fiction leads is a compelling idea.  Like a car wreck from hell, the execution is as disturbing as it can be, yet still compelling enough that I could not stop watching.  As for the ending, The last words in the film are ""I feel sick"", which sums up my feelings exactly as the credits rolled.  I felt ill, mentally numb, confused for what I had just watched was intellegent, imaginative, well thought out, but also psychodelic on a level that I cannot describe.In the end I honestly say that I am the proud owner of this movie.  But At the same time, I only watch it with friends that have never seen it.  Like Grave of the Fireflies, it is not a movie you watch too lighten up or kill time.  It is a film of imagination and impact, but also of grave and shocking images.  You cannot not be affected by this film.  The only question is, what will the affect be?  This film is a love it or hate it affair.  With no room for middle ground.  I personally like it...  But I have reservations bout recommending it to others.  Watch or buy with care.",4,The most disturbing movie you will ever love.,1052784000,"05 13, 2003",2003,3441,"['Evangelion', 'was', 'series', 'had', 'fair', 'share', 'wierdness', 'religous', 'themes', 'Originally', 'director', 'Hdieki', 'Anno', 'Meant', 'themes', 'be', 'sort', 'backstory', 'last', 'two', 'episodes', 'Evangelion', 'were', 'episodes', 'very', 'literally', 'delved', 'thoughts', 'feelings', 'main', 'characters', 'ended', 'off', 'camera', 'end', 'world', 'subsequent', 'long', 'awaited', 'maturing', 'series', 'protagonist', 'shinji', 'Ikari.Most', 'Fans', 'were', 'less', 'then', 'pleased', 'End', 'world', 'not', 'being', 'animated', 'Anno', 'wished', 'end', 'focus', 'shinji', 'not', 'appoccalypse', 'Fans', 'demanded', 'appoccalypse', 'be', 'animated', 'movie', 'ova', 'come', 'Anno', 'head.As', 'old', 'Saying', 'Be', 'careful', 'what', 'wish', 'End', 'Evangelion', 'Was', 'made', 'fans', 'were', 'Confused', 'hated', 'movie', 'wanted', 'burn', 'Others', 'loved', 'found', 'be', 'perfect', 'end', 'too', 'series', 'many', 'more', 'Just', 'didnt', 'know', 'what', 'think', 'chalked', 'up', 'too', 'too', 'much', 'drug', 'use', 'Anno', 'part.The', 'film', 'not', 'faint', 'heart', 'have', 'long', 'referred', 'too', 'DVD', 'WIDOWMAKER', 'sense', 'DVD', 'show', 'too', 'casual', 'anime', 'fans', 'too', 'ascertain', 'will', 'become', 'hardcore', 'finish', 'watching', 'honestly', 'say', 'understood', 'even', 'slightly', 'appreciated', 'what', 'happened', 'become', 'hardcore', 'anime', 'fans', 'Others', 'make', 'up', 'too', 'crucifixan', 'EVA', '01', 'end', 'world', 'go', 'pray', 'porcelain', 'god.The', 'opening', 'scene', 'Shell', 'shocked', 'shinji', 'desparately', 'looking', 'comfort', 'masterbating', 'over', 'catatonic', 'Asuka', 'Then', 'was', 'falling', 'out', 'Nerve', 'Seele', 'results', 'Nerv', 'falling', 'seige', 'seele', 'tries', 'too', 'recapture', 'Eva', 'Gendo', 'process', 'Asuka', 'will', 'recover', 'Fight', 'death', 'Eva', 'models', '5-13', 'Shinji', 'will', 'continue', 'be', 'desteibly', 'whiny', 'self', 'loathing', 'Fans', 'will', 'finally', 'be', 'able', 'too', 'see', 'long', 'postponed', 'end', 'world', 'problem', 'Problem', 'kinda', 'got', 'ta', 'agree', 'people', 'thinking', 'Anno', 'Was', 'drugs', 'making', 'film', 'images', 'will', 'literally', 'shock', 'point', 'where', 'wont', 'be', 'able', 'think', 'least', 'day', 'appoccalypse', 'biblical', 'prophesy', 'fiction', 'sciance', 'result', 'most', 'Out', 'there', 'animated', 'sequance', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'long', 'years', 'watching', 'anime', 'merging', 'biblical', 'prophesy', 'science', 'fiction', 'compelling', 'idea', 'car', 'wreck', 'hell', 'execution', 'as', 'disturbing', 'can', 'be', 'still', 'compelling', 'could', 'not', 'stop', 'watching', 'ending', 'last', 'words', 'film', 'are', 'feel', 'sick', 'sums', 'up', 'feelings', 'exactly', 'credits', 'rolled', 'felt', 'ill', 'mentally', 'numb', 'confused', 'what', 'had', 'just', 'watched', 'was', 'intellegent', 'imaginative', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'also', 'psychodelic', 'level', 'can', 'not', 'describe.In', 'end', 'honestly', 'say', 'am', 'proud', 'owner', 'movie', 'same', 'time', 'only', 'watch', 'friends', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'Grave', 'Fireflies', 'not', 'movie', 'watch', 'too', 'lighten', 'up', 'kill', 'time', 'film', 'imagination', 'impact', 'also', 'grave', 'shocking', 'images', 'can', 'not', 'not', 'be', 'affected', 'film', 'only', 'question', 'what', 'will', 'affect', 'be', 'film', 'love', 'hate', 'affair', 'room', 'middle', 'ground', 'personally', 'have', 'reservations', 'recommending', 'others', 'Watch', 'buy', 'care']",N/A
705090,A194GQYVY9HXUP,B000068OJ1,Ray-Review,"[3, 4]","End of Evangelion is one of the most amazing anime movies ever captured on film. The point of this movie is that the creator took this movie as a replacement for the last 2 episodes which dissapointed over thousands of fans which thought that the original 2 episodes were way too complicated and to confusing to understand. But because Anno (da creator) is so damn generous he remade the last episodes into a theaterical film which was viewed in Japan a couple years ago.Summary.Nerv has defeated all of the 18 angels and all is well until the tokyo 3 government has decided that there is no need for NERV anymore so they decide to take the evagelions and ADAM & LILITH by force. AAlso another organization has sent 9 eva units to destroy the evangelions. This is where it gets way too violent. to be honest the movie is almost as confusing as the series but it ends so cruel. Anyway Asuka is forced to fight off all of the eva series by herself and in only 3 and a half minutes, it ends so cruel altough she does take them all down for a minor minut the vea sereis come back alive and completly tear EVA unit 2 limb from limb they take apart Asukas left eye (in the movie it shows tons of blood flowing of here left eye) and it presumes she is dead. And when Shinji coming from all that trauma back at headquarters when Misato and almost every staff member dies, he comes into the line of battle where the first thing he sees is parts from EVA unit 2 being carried into the air by the evas and he begins to go crazy. That was just the first half which contains all the gruesome blood and horrible battle scenes,although the second half is still a lil bit over the edge, it is placed in Shinjis mind where all his thoughts and ego is considered whether or not the world is doomed or not. The second half is is very much alike the last episode in the sereis, extremely confusing but makes a lil bit more sense than the series. In the end all of the philosophical trauma that SHinji goes through he comes up with a conclusion, (as long there is one person living, that alone proves that humanity does indeed exist). In the movie Shinji wishes that he was dead and that he hated everyone else, but it would seem that the exact opposite wish he wanted appeared, everyone in the world is dead and he is the only humaan being except for Asuka that is still alive. And this is all of the events that happened during what was called THIRD IMPACT>",5,An end to an amazing series.

I rented the VHS some time ago and I watched it 3 times.

Here are the pros and cons:PROS:-Finally, this movie is out on DVD. I was waiting for the DVD to come, and a year later, it's out on DVD.-Great commentary! I constantly found myself entertained by a few few of the comments.-Has both English and Japanese versions-Great priceCONS:-DESPITE WHAT THE BACK SAYS, THIS DVD'S ASPECT RATIO IS NOT ANAMORPHIC WIDESCCREEN. It's fullscreen, just that someone taped the widescreen version and transfered it to DVD. Or at least something like that, I guess...-HORRIBLE PICTURE QUALITY! The picture was grainy, a few times I couldn't see sh**!-The Subtitles are transparent.

Ok, this is nice, how's are a very good thing to have in coherent storytelling. The only thing is--surprise--this disappears about 1/2 way and you're left with the same psychedelic babble as last time, just with a different direction.

Let me say this, after the whole Eva series (even after the odd episodes of 25 &amp; 26), I could not wait to watch the movies. When they finally arrived and I could watch them, I was ready to be on the edge of my seat. I never expected to feel so much disgust and disappointment. My whole week was ruined. How could a series that started out so upbeat and interesting end like this? I loved every one of thopse characters and this was how they treated them. I about had it with the whole Evangelion saga.However, my husband wanted to watch the whole series after I ordered them in the mail. So I watched all of the episodes and movies again with him. Boy did it all make complete sense. My husband of course was completely confused.Regardless, I was finally satisfied and happy about all of it. I could accept the fact that it was all about the beginning of a new era of life. It was all a concept of how the end of the world would be for the human race and how it was up to Shingi to decide on mankind's fate. That was why the angels were trying to get to central dogma. They wanted to join with Lilith and Adam so their their form would continue to exist. There really wasn't much else to it. Yes there were images and phrases that could lead to deeper meaning, but it was really all about another theory on how we may have come to be and how we will continue to exists.It did help listening to the commentary. So if you need some sort of closure on this series, watch the whole series a second time and then view the movie with the commentary.I know a lot of people were pretty disappointed about the movies and how this amazing series ended. Some may be shocked by the nudity and violence. But that is how life is and we come into this world with just our bodies and birth is violent. Made sense that the characters were naked during the final sequence.People need to have open minds when viewing these movies and let go. No need to hold onto reality. That is the beauty of Anime! It never really makes sense in Anime.

I started collecting the platinum editions (recommended) of the series.  Well here we go!A little summary of this movie/ series is that Shinji Ikari, the protagonist, is stuck in between a rock and the end of the world.  For a movie that was released between episodes 25 and 26, was a great concept.  The series is like the entire movie: Shinji is afraid, Asuka Langly Soryu tries to be a hot shot, and Rei Ayanami is still quiet and alien-like.  Not much character development from the series to the movie.Next, is the music.  The music was great.  With composers and bands such as Shiro Sagisu and VOX, this was what really made the movie; the score.Graphics were great and, like all anime movies, more... energetic then the ""stop and talk"" motions you would normally see.  If you have a weak stomach and faint when you see blood, rent ""The Passion of Christ"" because this movie is beyond gory and violent!

I guess when they had all the violence and gore, they decided to kick it up a notch and add the language.  Something that doesn't really rock my boat.My final rating is four stars out of five.

You thought the series got you confused? The End of Evangellion will twist your mind!I rented this movie and I must say, I was blown away! I was amazed, counfused and left asking questions! Anno did an Incredible job!Warning!! there are a few spoilersAnyways, Asuka finally snaps out of depression and is sent to destroy a new eva series. She realizes that her mother has been with her all along and protecting her in her eva. (Sice the whole thing that happened and all.) And asuka is really kicking butt! This part has alot of action! Until eventually, the evas regenerate and Asuka trys to kill them but apparently, one of the evas throw a replica of the Lance of Longinus at her eva, head and peirces through her AT field and peirces thorugh her eva's head. while Asuka can feel every pain in that area. (note: it is said that that the Lance peirced Jesus side. Thats why it can defeat ans Evas AT field) So the evas are practically eating her eva like buzzards! I thought when Asuka repeaded ""I'll kill you... kill you all..."" added alot of suspences in this scene. Apparently her arm opnes in half .I think. and thats pretty much the end of Unit 02.Meanwhile Rei and Mr. Ikari are in the heart of eva and rei merges with the angel Lillith Triggering the Third Impact which SEELE Planned to happen to re shape humanity. Shingi forms with his eva and I'm pretty much gonna stop there. I think I gave you pretty much of a review.Now, I see that people complain about the weird ending. I have to admit, the end of the whole movie had A little to be desired. But who knows. Anno probablt intended it that way to make you hypothisize searching through the meaning of the ending. But thats just a weird theory I came up with.Anyways my point is, You must see this! Evangellion is something different and reaches beyond the limit of normal anime. It's unique, confusing and different.

705100,ABVULUZ2ILKKO,B000068OJ1,Stephen Ressel,"[19, 49]","So you've seen the Evangelion series, and you thought the ending was atrocious.You've seen the first Evangelion movie, Death &amp; Rebirth, and realized, after a long, boring ride of re-hash, that it cut off RIGHT when things began to get moving.So now you are onto the FINAL, final, End to all Evangelion period, and you're gonna buy this DVD.  Surprise, surprise!  You'll get your ending, but just another Japanese mecha sized m---le finger to the audience and fan.  While 'End of Evangelion' begins and ends with a lot more movement and style then the first film, it still proves that the top honcho of this series CAN'T find the guts to write a cohesive story or decisive ending.  If you haven't been blinded by the aura of the animation, or the deperate hopes that anime will redeem itself in the writing department to make up for its world class artwork, you will see what I mean.The final line of dialogue really sums up what the creator/writer thinks of himself, and his inability to create an ending, as exemplified by a crying Shinji, surrounded by a sea of Fanta, unable to complete his task and wallowing in his own sorrow and pity.'DISGUSTING.....'",1,An end to the end that never was an end ... it never ends.,1069113600,"11 18, 2003",2003,1161,"['So', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Evangelion', 'series', 'thought', 'ending', 'was', 'atrocious.You', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'first', 'Evangelion', 'movie', 'Death', 'amp', 'Rebirth', 'realized', 'long', 'boring', 'ride', 're-hash', 'cut', 'off', 'RIGHT', 'when', 'things', 'began', 'get', 'moving.So', 'now', 'are', 'FINAL', 'final', 'End', 'Evangelion', 'period', ""'re"", 'gon', 'buy', 'DVD', 'Surprise', 'surprise', ""'ll"", 'get', 'ending', 'just', 'Japanese', 'mecha', 'sized', 'm', '-le', 'finger', 'audience', 'fan', ""'End"", 'Evangelion', 'begins', 'lot', 'more', 'movement', 'style', 'then', 'first', 'film', 'still', 'top', 'honcho', 'series', 'CA', ""N'T"", 'find', 'guts', 'write', 'cohesive', 'story', 'decisive', 'ending', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'blinded', 'aura', 'animation', 'deperate', 'hopes', 'anime', 'will', 'redeem', 'writing', 'department', 'make', 'up', 'world', 'class', 'artwork', 'will', 'see', 'what', 'mean.The', 'final', 'line', 'dialogue', 'really', 'sums', 'up', 'what', 'creator/writer', 'thinks', 'inability', 'create', 'ending', 'exemplified', 'crying', 'Shinji', 'surrounded', 'sea', 'Fanta', 'unable', 'complete', 'task', 'wallowing', 'own', 'sorrow', ""pity.'DISGUSTING"", '..']",N/A
705101,A2A8PN3Q5QVNR6,B000068OJ1,Suzanne,"[17, 18]","For those turning to this film to answer all the questions that the last two episodes of the Evangelion (NGE) series didn't answer, I suggest you look elsewhere. If anything, this film will provide you with precious few answers but a multitude of new questions. For those wanting a highly provocative, thought-provoking, intelligent and most poignant conclusion to the NGE series, then have no fear. I will try to explain some of the more perplexing elements in this film, without giving too much away, as well giving my thoughts and opinions at the same time.The film is structured to be the final two episodes of the series. So the first half, Ep. 25 ""Air/Love is Destructive"" is concurrent with the series episode 25 ""The World Ending/Do You Love Me?"". The second half, Ep. 26. ""My Purest Heart for You/One More Final: I Need You"" is concurrent with the series episode 26 ""The Beast that Shouted Love at the Heart of the World/Take Care of Yourself.""Much like the NGE series, the End of Evangelion (EoE) weaves a complex story where images and dialogue are closely related to the philosophy and symbolism. These themes are played out through the psychology of each characters' own mind. It is essentially a microcosm of the entire series. The opening scenes before the ""Air"" title card of Ep. 25 of Shinji overlooking the ruins of the city, and then entering Asuka's hospital room and, (I'll leave it there) set the mood and atmosphere. Showing effectively and very disturbingly that this is NOT going to be an easy film. As the first half roars out of the gates at breakneck speed, we see the hostile takeover of Nerv by the Seele organization and each Nerv member's desperate attempt to hold it at bay.We also see the mental states that the two main Eva pilots - Shinji and Asuka - have been reduced too. Shinji is severely depressed after killing the last angel, Kaworu, whom he had formed a close bond with. Asuka is in the same mental boat as Shinji as she sits at the bottom of the lake in her Eva, which she feels she can't pilot anymore. What's interesting is the paths that have driven these two characters to this point. The ideas of finding one's self-worth (examined perfectly in the final two series episodes), and what happens to a person when that is taken away.At the same time Seele is trying to initiate their plans for Third Impact using Unit-01 and the downright creepy looking Mass-Produced Eva Series, Gendo has his own plans involving Rei and Lilith. As Asuka,  (with a little help and inspiration from her Mama) rages an extremely violent battle with the Evil Evas, Gendo takes Rei down to Lilith. He does this to unite the souls and bodies of Adam and Lilith only to find his scorned lover, Ritsuko there. It's interesting that two of the most shocking and violent scenes (the Asuka/Eva battle and the Gendo/Ritsuko confrontation) are played out to Bach's beautiful ""Air"". The infusion of the music in this film is truly brilliant and a major reason why many scenes are so effective.However, this is the point in the film where most people will start to become completely lost. Without a really good understanding of the NGE story (and perhaps even with one), it's hard not to. It's very difficult to make the extremely complex simple, however I'll try without many spoilers.Suffice it to say that Seele were trying to initiate Third Impact and reduce humankind back to its original form - the Primordial Soup of Life where all souls and beings are one. Gendo had different plans and just wanted to see his 'dead' wife, Yui again. Neither Seele's or Gendo's plans go exactly as they were meant to. Unit-01, along with Shinji, ends up becoming the Tree of Life, and the ark in which all souls are ushered through and into Lilith's Egg. Understanding the idea that in NGE, humans - Lilim, as we're called - were born from Lilith, and Rei is essentially Lilith helps make this clearer. What's happening near this point is 3rd Impact is occurring because of the Unit-01 and the Mass Produced Eva encounter. This returns the Geo-Front (the sphere like cavern where Nerv HQ sits) to its original form, the Egg of Lilith (we see this during the ""Eye""-like explosion). After the Giant Rei/Lilith forms, Shinji is essentially given reign over the future of the human race by Rei/Lilith herself.At this point, the tempo of the film slows to a crawl and the most surreal images and scenes begin creeping in. Even the most seemingly simple scenes such as a young Shinji playing in a sandbox with a swing, mountains, and a setting sun in the background is just rife with symbolism (hint: try to relate everything in this scene with something in the show, be it scenes, characters, or themes). Here, the psychological interplay between the main characters is crucial, as Shinji's wishes are played out in the real world. When he feels that everyone has deserted him and essentially says 'everyone can just die' is when the Instrumentality and joining of all souls through Lilith really begins.What's important to note is Shinji's thoughts after his 'choice' has been made. The place he escapes to - the world of Instrumentality where all souls are one - and his questioning of this choice and all his choices is what we see here. More than just his questioning of the choice, we also hear him questioning the meaning of reality and dreams. This is not just random philosophical ramblings. It's a study of a character's, as well as the creator's, thoughts and feelings. Shinji holds all of humanity's future in his hands or, more accurately, his own mind. When you consider how psychologically scarred Shinji is, the idea that he can completely shape the future of Earth and all of humankind is what makes this so interesting.Once he is allowed to be in the world he escapes to, he's faced with another choice of whether to stay or come back. As he discusses these things with Rei and Kaworu (Lilith and Adam), we hear his final choice and reasons why. The ending of EoE, titled ""One More Final: I Need You"" is rightfully confusing to almost everyone who sees it. However, it's also the perfect note to end the series with. Not only does it leave us as uncertain as the characters are about the future, but it also expresses the frustration and realization of Shinji's choice and the culmination of all the struggles that has lead them there.This film is simply a divine marvel. Much like the series it has to be watched multiple times for one to uncover all of its hidden layers and meanings. But it doesn't lose its ability to invoke emotions and thoughts even after several viewings. There are scenes of immense power and drama in the film - many that match the best of most films I've seen. But I think it's the quiet moments that make this film so moving and memorable. The Sandbox scene is one I've mentioned. Another is the live action shots with the monologue and Bach's magnificent ""Jesus Bleibet Meine Freude"" (Jesus, Joy of Man's Desiring) playing along on piano with it. Even more subtle moments, such as Shinji's SDAT (walkman type) player out of batteries (more significant than many would think), and Gendo's broken glasses in Rei's place. With the vivid beginning of Instrumentality played out to the appropriate sad-song-with-a-pop-beat ""Komm Susser Tod"" (Come Sweet Death), it's these scenes that never fail to give me chills.There's a great quote that goes something like ""A truly wise man always has more questions than answers."" This is a series and film that asks more questions than it provides answers. What it tries to do is make you think about those questions, rather than provide an easily digestible story. Some may call the story incoherent and disjointed, but what many don't realize is that the deep psychological and philosophical leanings behind the show are inextricably linked with the storyline itself. So to distinguish one from the other is impossible without realizing how the two intertwine and effect the other. If you merely try to breakdown the sci-fi storyline, then you will be confused by much of it. This is because the story is so big and so encompassing that many finer details can't be uncovered without diving deep into the inner workings of the series.In the end, I can only speak for myself when I say NGE did a superlative job of doing everything a great work of art should do. It made me laugh, it made me cry, it gave me chills on more than one occasion.... but most of all it made me THINK. Anyone who wants to enjoy this show as just a meaningless work of science fiction can do so, but will be baffled as they're crushed by the multiple layers of extra contextual meanings. So, if you want to understand NGE, you have to not only pay close attention to the small details within the show (small scenes from many episodes back play a role in the film), you have to really open your mind up to the ideas being presented, and how they effect the story.However, taken as a film, and the conclusion to the NGE series, End of Evangelion is a staggering achievement and powerful last testament to what is, in my opinion, the greatest visual series of all time.*DVD NOTES:Those considering whether to buy just the EoE or the EoE/Death & Rebirth 2-pack, I suggest you go with the EoE unless you don't own the director's cuts of the last several episodes (available in the Platinum Collection). 'Death' is mostly a muddled re-crap of the entire series, while 'Rebirth' is merely the first 30 minutes of EoE. Death also doesn't contain remastered visuals or audio like the Platinum Collection does, so you'll be getting a low quality re-cap at that. Death really doesn't even work as an introduction to NGE, because most everyone not aquainted with previous episodes would be confused by the structure of the recap. The only thing worthwile in 'Death' is something called ""The Magi Archives"" which provides great information about key people, places, events, and thing in the series. This is very helpful to those who feel completely lost by all the jargon in the series and will help clear some things up, even if it won't answer any of the bigger questions. So just stick with EoE unless you feel the need for completeness to get Death & Rebirth as well.",5,The Brilliant Conclusion to a Most Profound Series,1172793600,"03 2, 2007",2007,10217,"['turning',

705103,A24SA7IVTEHCMI,B000068OJ1,The Otaku,"[1, 2]","I must begin by saying if you are either: a. New to Evangelion's complex world of storytelling or b. You didn't understand Evangelion: The Series, don't watch this. This movie takes everything you've learned in the series and makes it weirder. Note, I'm basically explaining most of the movie here, so spoilers ahead.The movie actually begins where ""Rebirth"" of ""Death and Rebirth"" started off. This is a nice little recap and since you already know what happens, your left waiting until they reach the point we all were left anticipating, SEELE sending nine EVAS against the lone EVA UNIT-02 and Asuka, newly recovered from her mental issues. This was a VERY bloody movie, Asuka fights the SEELE Evas and actually seems as though she might win, until she finds out the double-bladed swords these EVAS are carrying actually are Lance of Longinus (See VOL 7 of Evangelion anime) duplicates. The way she finds this out is after she's smashed almost all of them, they regrow limbs and a Lance is thrown into UNIT-02's head, causing Asuka great pain.Shinji, meanwhile, is still trying to get to UNIT-01 with Misato. She is shot on the way into the vents and just before they reach their target, Misato says she can't go on and kisses Shinji (on the mouth for more than five seconds)before sending him down to UNIT-01.She dies not soon after as Shinji races to the Geofront's surface where he sees a grisly sight: the SEELE Evas have become vulture-like and have ripped most of the biological matter from UNIT-02, meaning we have eyeballs, flesh, and organs sticking out of UNIT-02. Of course, Shinji suddenly goes insane again at this sight.In Central Dogma, or one of those Dogma Sections, Comm. Ikari and Rei are in front of Lilith, the supposed First Angel but revealed by Kaoru as a fake. Now, Ikari wants to start Third Impact by having himself, with his hand fused with the real ADAM I think, come into contact with Rei (to initiate Third Impact). Well, Rei says to him she isn't a puppet and fuses with Lilith, creating a giant Rei. This is where the movie becomes very psychological and I found myself asking what I was watching.What happened in that psychological period became reminiscent to the original episodes 25 and 26. Shinji has internal conflictions with his schizophrenia-induced illusions and by the end, he finally relizes that he doesn't want a lonely world populated by just one person.By the end of the movie, these facts were prevalent: Third Impact had happened but Shinji and Asuka, able to fight the fusion into one body, one mind, had been able to escape; everyone was dead (or at least there was no one in the LCL submerged area that was Tokyo-3); Shinji and Asuka are obviously going to have to repopulate the planet.All in all: This was the single most confusing movie I ever watched, until my second viewing when I understood most of it, but if you get past the weird psycho-insanity and very depressing (and disturbing) mental instability these children go through, and watch it again, you can finally see what happens to every Evangelion member.

705104,A3JADS9AZXTBAG,B000068OJ1,"Timstuff ""tim16733""","[5, 5]","Evangelion is one of my favorite Anime series, and like most fans, I really dislike the show's original ending. And so, Gainax gave us End of Evangelion, a 90 minute feature length movie composed of two alternate versions of Episodes 25 and 26, complete with episode title cards. This is hardly a straight-up movie.The movie itself is very well animated, and gives fans the massive, climactic battle that was pined for, as well as what's quite possibly the most visually bizzare climax I've seen in an Anime.The storyline in EoE is actually much more straight-forward than you might expect, however it gets kind of bogged down with the frequent injection of strange imagery that isn't really connected with the main story. There is even a portion of the movie featuring live action footage, and it will not really make sense to you unless you know the story behind why it was put in there. This movie is definately not for people prone to optic siezures, either!I think I'd say this is probably an R-rated movie. In addition to the violence and gore, there's more profanity than the show with the F-bomb being dropped at least twice, and there is also a lot of nudity. It wasn't as rampant as Ghost in the Shell, but it's still worth pointing out. And, there is some sexual content as well, including a scene at the beginning where Shinji masturbates off-camera (and we see the ""aftermath"" all over his hand afterwards), and there's also a sex scene that happens mostly off-camera, however we do see the woman's feet accompanied by muffled sound. Consider yourself warned if you're planning to show this to younger teens, but chances are if they've already seen the show, this won't be much further beyond that.Overall, I'd say it's a decent movie, and you should buy it if you already own the series. When coupled with the director's cut episodes, you have a full replacement for episodes 21-26. If you've only seen the show on TV, then try to find somewhere to rent EoE, because you owe it to yourself. It's hardly perfect, but it at least leaves you with the answers to some questions that the original leaves burning in your head, and gives you some really well animated (although often VERY weird) imagery. The DVD image quality itself isn't particularly high unfortunately, and it's not even in animorphic widescreen (you get good ol'  crappy ""letterbox"" widescreen instead). But at least the movie itself is there and perfectly watchable, and seeing as this is the only version avalible I'd say you should buy it rather than holding out for a re-release.I'm really very interested to see what ADV does with the live-action Evangelion movie project. I want to see if when they get to the series conclusion, they'll be able to adapt it in a way that makes it less confusing and more palletable, or if they'll cop out and change it to something completely different. I guess we'll only be able to wait and see.",4,"A concrete conclusion to the show, but still pretty trippy.",1148947200,"05 30, 2006",2006,2914,"['Evangelion', 'one', 'favorite', 'Anime', 'series', 'most', 'fans', 'really', 'dislike', 'show', 'original', 'ending', 'so', 'Gainax', 'gave', 'End', 'Evangelion', '90', 'minute', 'feature', 'length', 'movie', 'composed', 'two', 'alternate', 'versions', 'Episodes', '25', '26', 'complete', 'episode', 'title', 'cards', 'hardly', 'straight-up', 'movie.The', 'movie', 'very', 'well', 'animated', 'fans', 'massive', 'climactic', 'battle', 'was', 'pined', 'as', 'well', 'what', 'quite', 'possibly', 'most', 'visually', 'bizzare', 'climax', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Anime.The', 'storyline', 'EoE', 'actually', 'much', 'more', 'straight-forward', 'might', 'expect', 'however', 'kind', 'bogged', 'frequent', 'injection', 'strange', 'imagery', ""n't"", 'really', 'connected', 'main', 'story', 'even', 'portion', 'movie', 'featuring', 'live', 'action', 'footage', 'will', 'not', 'really', 'make', 'sense', 'know', 'story', 'why', 'was', 'put', 'there', 'movie', 'definately', 'not', 'people', 'prone', 'optic', 'siezures', 'either', 'think', ""'d"", 'say', 'probably', 'R-rated', 'movie', 'addition', 'violence', 'gore', 'more', 'profanity', 'show', 'F-bomb', 'being', 'dropped', 'least', 'twice', 'also', 'lot', 'nudity', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'rampant', 'Ghost', 'Shell', 'still', 'worth', 'pointing', 'out', 'sexual', 'content', 'as', 'well', 'including', 'scene', 'beginning', 'where', 'Shinji', 'off-camera', 'see', 'aftermath', 'hand', 'afterwards', 'also', 'sex', 'scene', 'mostly', 'off-camera', 'however', 'do', 'see', 'woman', 'feet', 'accompanied', 'muffled', 'sound', 'Consider', 'warned', ""'re"", 'planning', 'show', 'younger', 'teens', 'chances', 'are', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'show', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'much', 'further', 'that.Overall', ""'d"", 'say', 'decent', 'movie', 'should', 'buy', 'already', 'own', 'series', 'When', 'coupled', 'director', 'cut', 'episodes', 'have', 'full', 'replacement', 'episodes', '21-26', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', 'show', 'TV', 'then', 'try', 'find', 'somewhere', 'rent', 'EoE', 'owe', 'hardly', 'perfect', 'least', 'leaves', 'answers', 'questions', 'original', 'leaves', 'burning', 'head', 'really', 'well', 'animated', 'often', 'VERY', 'weird', 'imagery', 'DVD', 'image', 'quality', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'high', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'even', 'animorphic', 'widescreen', 'get', 'good', 'ol', 'crappy', 'letterbox', 'widescreen', 'instead', 'least', 'movie', 'there', 'perfectly', 'watchable', 'seeing', 'only', 'version', 'avalible', ""'d"", 'say', 'should', 'buy', 'rather', 'holding', 'out', 're-release.I', ""'m"", 'really', 'very', 'interested', 'see', 'what', 'ADV', 'live-action', 'Evangelion', 'movie', 'project', 'want', 'see', 'when', 'get', 'series', 'conclusion', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'adapt', 'way', 'less', 'confusing', 'more', 'palletable', ""'ll"", 'cop', 'out', 'change', 'something', 'completely', 'different', 'guess', ""'ll"", 'only', 'be', 'able', 'wait', 'see']",N/A

Death and Rebirth was one of those things that did not bring a conclusion to the work. On the contrary, it seemed to take an arthouse approach and make the world - odd. There were words and there were images, but the angles you expect to find are nowhere to be seen. Worse still, the things that the last angel had to say are not playing out in the format you might expect - everything just went out the window.Thank goodness for this movie.When this movie hit, it starts with the destruction of NERV. People start to fall and pilots take dives, and everything makes you feel like you are starting to see a plan unfold. From the spear to the pilots and the role that the people play - from the kids to the things grown in tanks - all come out. Even more profound are the connections to Shingi and his Eva that are really explained here. and, amidst all of this are the things that come out during Shingi's awkwardness.to say that this is an ending worth catching is an understatement. I personally feared it when I watched it the first time, but that fear quickly fluttered out the window when the fighting began. It is more than the fighting, too, because so many questions are still here. You find out a lot on the people that you didn't know, and you see people falling as the world literally collapses. Honestly, it is hard to say anything else without spoiling anything (so I'll leave it with that).If you have not caught this series, do it now. You have new episodes that feel in blank spots, but even the old stuff is enough. From the way the Evas go crazy to the connections that the people have, you really want to see this. You also want to see what it all means and how mankind is literally saying ""no"" to the plans that have been written and foretold.

THis is the supposed end to the series and quite frankly it ends in a very depressing manner.  The story takes place after the final episode of probably the best anime series ever and it starts off with the humans attacking the Evangellion HQ.  For the first half it is grueling battle with lots of explosions and gore.  However after wards it revolves around SHinji and his choice to either save the world or destroy it.  Keep in mind that for the first half he was sniviling like a little baby because of what appears to be the fact that he killed his buddy at the end of the series.  However as the last half plays out you find out that he is not upset over the fact that he killed his friend (although it might have something to do with it), no his problem is that he works with three very hot ladies and he can't ""get it on"" with any of them.  Yes, Shinjis problem is that he can't get laid.  That's it.  The story is supposed to represent life and death but instead is about SHinji being upset over the fact that he can't get laid, primarily at the main point of his effection Oska.SO overall if you are looking for closure to the series, good luck because this doesn't cut it.

Wickes,"[9, 10]","Like some people's reviews have said before this one, if you want the real effect, watch the Japanese version with English subtitles first, because it is a lot more dramatic than the toned down english version. I am not saying that the english version is bad, because it is still the best anime I have ever seen, but nothing can touch the original japanese version. My one example is at the very end where in the Japanese version when Asuka says &quot;I feel sick&quot; instead of &quot;Disgusting&quot; and then it goes into that amazing piece by Bach, you just sit there staring at the screen knowing you had just witnessed something utterly amazing. (The song is &quot;Jesus Bleibet Meine Freud&quot; if anyone has tried to search for it like I did) In the English version it ends in some cheesy song that just doesn't set the mood.Ok though, enough blabbering about what was wrong, let me talk about what went right. NGE: End of Evangelion is easily the greatest conclusion to any series I have ever seen. I would rate the original 26 episode TV series as decently good, but this movie just blows everything away. Not only will it mess with your head and leave you speechless, but you will also feel a since of accomplishment when you have finished watching it, as if you have just experienced one of the finer things in life. End of Evangelion is everything an anime should be and more. It makes you think and look for deeper meanings in things.

I popped in the tape , and as the movie went on , I wondered who could have gave this movie the green-light to be produced!This film essentially acts as an alternate ending ,replacing the  rather confusing ep 25 and 26 of the tv . Fine , I have to say this movie is definetly a improvement in both terms of quality and cohesion in contrast to the tv ending , but there is still editing they should have done.The movie does have a decent amount of action , especially when the guys with dark suits arrive at the EVA bunker and start killing everbody , as well as when Asuka engages a bunch of other ""Angels"" in her EVA.Once the action grinds to a halt , I found the movie broke down.  We start delving once again into the recesses of Shinji's mind ( like ep 25 , 26), which no one really cares for since it is such a disturbing place. Suffice to say , there ends up being a lot of B.S scenes and plenty of plot holes.  Especially the live-action footage they had in the movie. It just didn't look right.  They shoulda took that right outta there.Anyone , if your a die-hard Neon fan , and you wanna get your grubby hands on this movie , the DVD is your best bet.  You get two languages and noticible res increase from the 'ol VHS edition.Stick to the Japanese language unless your a total ignoramous and hate subtitles.",2,Slightly more entertaining ending to an atrocious series,1031788800,"09 12, 2002",2002,1374,"['finally', 'got', 'hold', 'End', 'Evangelion', 'last', 'week', 'popped', 'tape', 'movie', 'went', 'wondered', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'gave', 'movie', 'green-light', 'be', 'produced', 'film', 'essentially', 'alternate', 'ending', 'replacing', 'rather', 'confusing', 'ep', '25', '26', 'tv', 'Fine', 'have', 'say', 'movie', 'definetly', 'improvement', 'terms', 'quality', 'cohesion', 'contrast', 'tv', 'ending', 'still', 'editing', 'should', 'have', 'done.The', 'movie', 'have', 'decent', 'amount', 'action', 'especially', 'when', 'guys', 'dark', 'suits', 'arrive', 'EVA', 'bunker', 'start', 'killing', 'everbody', 'as', 'well', 'when', 'Asuka', 'bunch', 'other', 'Angels', 'EVA.Once', 'action', 'halt', 'found', 'movie', 'broke', 'down', 'start', 'delving', 'once', 'again', 'recesses', 'Shinji', 'mind', 'ep', '25', '26', 'one', 'really', 'such', 'disturbing', 'place', 'Suffice', 'say', 'up', 'being', 'lot', 'B.S', 'scenes', 'plenty', 'plot', 'holes', 'Especially', 'live-action', 'footage', 'had', 'movie', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'right', 'shoulda', 'took', 'right', 'outta', 'there.Anyone', 'die-hard', 'Neon', 'fan', 'wan', 'na', 'get', 'grubby', 'hands', 'movie', 'DVD', 'best', 'bet', 'get', 'two', 'languages', 'noticible', 'res', 'increase', ""'ol"", 'VHS', 'edition.Stick', 'Japanese', 'language', 'total', 'ignoramous', 'hate', 'subtitles']",N/A
