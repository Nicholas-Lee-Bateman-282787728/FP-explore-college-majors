It did not come through as clearly as I would have liked, but it was &#34;free&#34;.  This year when I saw the disc I ordered it cost less than a disc with ONLY the movie I wanted and it was accompanied by 2 more Christmas movies.  Three for less than one!  How could I resist.

1456755,A2UYGOYMV73826,B005ELVCH0,Rushmore,"[3, 6]","One Special Night is one of my favorite holiday movies ever.  I am putty in the hands of Julie Andrews and James Garner.  If you are interested in seeing this movie, I strongly suggest you purchase it on its own.  If you want to know more about it, there are ample 5-star reviews on Amazon.The other two movies - not so much.  I got maybe 10 minutes into Christmas Clause and turned it off.  A movie with vomiting in it just does not feel very festive, and by that point I was not nearly engaged enough to care what happened to Lea Thompson's character, much as I like that actress.I lasted a little longer with Christmas in the Clouds, but only because I was appalled by how awful it was.  Loaded with racial and ethnic stereotypes, mistakenly billed as a ""riotous comedy,"" I was truly embarrassed for the poor actors who thought it was a good idea to appear in this misbegotten holiday-themed venture.I would give One Special Night 5 stars - even more if I could - but it is cheapened by combination with the other two movies.  This set is an example of the very best and very worst holiday fare produced for TV.",3,One out of 3 is a 5-star movie,1353888000,"11 26, 2012",2012,1114,"['One', 'Special', 'Night', 'one', 'favorite', 'holiday', 'movies', 'ever', 'am', 'putty', 'hands', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'James', 'Garner', 'are', 'interested', 'seeing', 'movie', 'strongly', 'suggest', 'purchase', 'own', 'want', 'know', 'more', 'are', 'ample', '5-star', 'reviews', 'Amazon.The', 'other', 'two', 'movies', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'got', 'maybe', '10', 'minutes', 'Christmas', 'Clause', 'turned', 'off', 'movie', 'vomiting', 'just', 'not', 'feel', 'very', 'festive', 'point', 'was', 'not', 'nearly', 'engaged', 'enough', 'care', 'what', 'happened', 'Lea', 'Thompson', 'character', 'much', 'like', 'actress.I', 'lasted', 'little', 'longer', 'Christmas', 'Clouds', 'only', 'was', 'appalled', 'how', 'awful', 'was', 'Loaded', 'racial', 'ethnic', 'stereotypes', 'mistakenly', 'billed', 'riotous', 'comedy', 'was', 'truly', 'embarrassed', 'poor', 'actors', 'who', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'idea', 'appear', 'misbegotten', 'holiday-themed', 'venture.I', 'would', 'give', 'One', 'Special', 'Night', '5', 'stars', 'even', 'more', 'could', 'cheapened', 'combination', 'other', 'two', 'movies', 'set', 'example', 'very', 'best', 'very', 'worst', 'holiday', 'fare', 'produced', 'TV']",Holiday Triple Feature One Special Night / Christmas Clause / Christmas in the Clouds
