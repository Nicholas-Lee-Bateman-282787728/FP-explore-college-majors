396005,A2Z5RFU4DH3T0G,6304016212,"A. Fondacaro ""NiaTonyF""","[59, 61]","I'm here to officially announce my heartfelt sentiment that &quot;The Maxx&quot; should get a DVD release.  &quot;The Maxx&quot; was part of the MTV's Oddities program that ran in the mid-90's before it went BETV and TEENBEAT on us.  Back then, MTV still had a shred of respectability by at least offering shows such as these to people who weren't popular, who weren't listening to the Top 40, and who didn't buy into mass-marketing-mainstream-lifestyle-bullcrap that floods our TVs, radios, and internet today.I can remember another &quot;Oddities&quot; program in particular called &quot;The Head&quot; that was just as fun to watch as &quot;The Maxx&quot; only not as intelligent or curious.  Anyone who was a fan of this stuff will remember &quot;Liquid Television&quot; that gave birth to &quot;Beavis and Butthead&quot; and also featured (I believe) &quot;Aeon Flux&quot; which is South Parkesque in that one of the leads dies in every episode.  What does this have to do with a DVD release?  Well, obviously MTV doesn't feel that these programs stand up on their own to merit an individual release, so why not just lump all these things together and set them out there?  Call it whatever you like--Liquid Television DVD, Oddities DVD, Mid-90's Culty Animated DVD, whatever.  My point is &quot;The Maxx.&quot;To summarize, this is a two-hour long feature adapted from the Sam Kieth comic &quot;The Maxx&quot; which follows a purple-and-yellow hero with a roided-out build called Maxx.  He is befriended by Julie Winters who is the victim of a serial rapist known as Mr. Gone.  Mr. Gone is also Maxx's arch-nemesis, or so Maxx thinks.  Then there's Sarah, the girl trying to be a writer, who sees Julie as, I suppose, a quasi-therapist.  Oh, and there's also a mirror-world called &quot;The Outback,&quot; also called &quot;Pangea&quot; filled with Crabbits, Mountain People, Leaping Slugs, Air-Whales, and gobs and gobs of chattering Isz's.  Once in this world; Julie Winters make the shift to the Leopard Queen, ruler of that world, and Maxx becomes her protector.  Have it figured out yet?I must have watched this 1,000 times over the years and I'm still not sure if I've got it all put together.  After two degrees in Literature and years of analysis experience I'm flustered.  As far as I've got is this; &quot;The Maxx&quot; is about potential realities intruding into perception of actual reality, so much so that the degree in which reality is grasped becomes blurred between what is and what probably is (accounting, by extension, for the name of the &quot;Isz&quot;).  Grasping and cognating reality is about shuffling through different dimensions, different existences and conflicting outcomes.  For example, when Maxx chases an Isz back from &quot;The Outback&quot; into Julie's apartment, he is made small while the Isz remains big.  He still maintains his personae as protector, while the Isz remains white (rather than black) and is prey rather than hunter, even though it would seem because of their size their roles would be reversed.I won't go on, but I know I could.  There's so much to work through and so many different possibilities that this stuff makes David Lynch seem like a board game, even though I don't care for Lynch.And even if you're not in &quot;intellect&quot; mode, you can still turn the lights off, put this on with a beverage and some chips-n-salsa and just enjoy the writing, because it's very good.",5,"Please, let's have a DVD release",1076630400,"02 13, 2004",2004,3444,"[""'m"", 'here', 'officially', 'announce', 'heartfelt', 'sentiment', 'quot', 'Maxx', 'quot', 'should', 'get', 'DVD', 'release', 'quot', 'Maxx', 'quot', 'was', 'part', 'MTV', 'Oddities', 'program', 'ran', 'mid-90', 'went', 'BETV', 'TEENBEAT', 'Back', 'then', 'MTV', 'still', 'had', 'shred', 'respectability', 'least', 'offering', 'shows', 'such', 'people', 'who', 'were', ""n't"", 'popular', 'who', 'were', ""n't"", 'listening', 'Top', '40', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'mass-marketing-mainstream-lifestyle-bullcrap', 'TVs', 'radios', 'internet', 'today.I', 'can', 'remember', 'quot', 'Oddities', 'quot', 'program', 'particular', 'called', 'quot', 'Head', 'quot', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'fun', 'watch', 'quot', 'Maxx', 'quot', 'only', 'not', 'intelligent', 'curious', 'Anyone', 'who', 'was', 'fan', 'stuff', 'will', 'remember', 'quot', 'Liquid', 'Television', 'quot', 'gave', 'birth', 'quot', 'Beavis', 'Butthead', 'quot', 'also', 'featured', 'believe', 'quot', 'Aeon', 'Flux', 'quot', 'South', 'Parkesque', 'one', 'leads', 'dies', 'episode', 'What', 'have', 'do', 'DVD', 'release', 'Well', 'obviously', 'MTV', ""n't"", 'feel', 'programs', 'stand', 'up', 'own', 'merit', 'individual', 'release', 'so', 'why', 'not', 'just', 'lump', 'things', 'together', 'set', 'out', 'there', 'Call', 'like', 'Liquid', 'Television', 'DVD', 'Oddities', 'DVD', 'Mid-90', 'Culty', 'Animated', 'DVD', 'point', 'quot', 'Maxx.', 'quot', 'summarize', 'two-hour', 'long', 'feature', 'adapted', 'Sam', 'Kieth', 'comic', 'quot', 'Maxx', 'quot', 'purple-and-yellow', 'hero', 'roided-out', 'build', 'called', 'Maxx', 'befriended', 'Julie', 'Winters', 'who', 'victim', 'serial', 'rapist', 'known', 'Mr.', 'Gone', 'Mr.', 'Gone', 'also', 'Maxx', 'arch-nemesis', 'so', 'Maxx', 'thinks', 'Then', 'Sarah', 'girl', 'trying', 'be', 'writer', 'who', 'Julie', 'suppose', 'quasi-therapist', 'Oh', 'also', 'mirror-world', 'called', 'quot', 'Outback', 'quot', 'also', 'called', 'quot', 'Pangea', 'quot', 'filled', 'Crabbits', 'Mountain', 'People', 'Leaping', 'Slugs', 'Air-Whales', 'gobs', 'gobs', 'chattering', 'Isz', 'Once', 'world', 'Julie', 'Winters', 'make', 'shift', 'Leopard', 'Queen', 'ruler', 'world', 'Maxx', 'protector', 'Have', 'figured', 'out', 'yet', 'must', 'have', 'watched', '1,000', 'times', 'years', ""'m"", 'still', 'not', 'sure', ""'ve"", 'got', 'put', 'together', 'two', 'degrees', 'Literature', 'years', 'analysis', 'experience', ""'m"", 'flustered', 'As', 'far', ""'ve"", 'got', 'quot', 'Maxx', 'quot', 'potential', 'realities', 'intruding', 'perception', 'actual', 'reality', 'so', 'much', 'degree', 'reality', 'grasped', 'becomes', 'blurred', 'what', 'what', 'probably', 'accounting', 'extension', 'name', 'quot', 'Isz', 'quot', 'Grasping', 'cognating', 'reality', 'shuffling', 'different', 'dimensions', 'different', 'existences', 'conflicting', 'outcomes', 'example', 'when', 'Maxx', 'Isz', 'back', 'quot', 'Outback', 'quot', 'Julie', 'apartment', 'made', 'small', 'Isz', 'big', 'still', 'personae', 'protector', 'Isz', 'white', 'rather', 'black', 'prey', 'rather', 'hunter', 'even', 'would', 'seem', 'size', 'roles', 'would', 'be', 'reversed.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'know', 'could', 'so', 'much', 'work', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'possibilities', 'stuff', 'David', 'Lynch', 'seem', 'board', 'game', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'Lynch.And', 'even', ""'re"", 'not', 'quot', 'intellect', 'quot', 'can', 'still', 'turn', 'lights', 'off', 'put', 'beverage', 'chips-n-salsa', 'just', 'enjoy', 'writing', 'very', 'good']",Maxx: Original Series VHS

The Maxx didn't belong on Mtv, and after only one season, it was canned. This is the only draw back to the video.

I quikly went and baught the movie at some old comic store new.  I had no I idea what the hell the show was about!  When I turned 15 I watched the movie again and realize........THATS WHAT IVE BIN MISSING!!!! the show that was once aired on mtv was a masterpiece I never thought I would own.
