982313,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B000F48D00,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[3, 5]","In the Prologue of Neil Young's beautiful concert DVD, 'Heart of Gold' key players, which are ample, reminisce over the highlights of concerts past.  Each musician is alone except interviewer and camera, and the feeling is eager but laid back.  Neil Young himself explains that the people he's chosen for this special concert are friends and not merely studio musicians, setting up a feel that Roy Orbison enjoyed for his magnificent 'Black and White Night' DVD.  There is the same sense of intimacy, and, while I suspected a retro act, the scope and splendor of the chosen material is great.  Although about two or three songs are familiar hits, he breathed real life into this concert at Reiman Auditorium in Nashville where the acoustics resonate with perfection.  Besides a great repertoire of songs, his styles draw from country, bluegrass, folk, gospel, blues, and rock.  Each song seems so singularly crafted and find Young switching from guitar to harmonica to banjo to piano.  Distinctively, he proves to have many friends who back him up with vocals, brass, guitars, fiddles, and, even, a broom.  Misguided casual fans like me are immediately struck by the economy of words that come in a stream on this ""Prairie Wind"" harvest.More specifically, theme song ""Prairie Wind"" opens with words ""It's a long road behind me...It's a long road ahead of me.""  Indeed even with his weathered, tan face he sings enraptured in his own music which translates the wisdom of his years.  Whether singing about 9/11 (""Falling off the Face of the Earth"") or ""King, the best hound dog,"" (""He Was King"") he connects in spare language.  At one of his intimate moments he shares before ""This Old Guitar"" how he acquired the worn guitar he uses onstage from Hank Williams.  Highlights are for every song, but ""When God Made Me"" so eloquently scotches any argument for chauvenism or bigotry known to man.  In too few words to measure, he bridges the gap to every gender, race, and creed.  Alone with his harmonica he adds to the mellow sweetness with ""I'm Still in Love with You"" and the lovely, wide-eyed ""Harvest Moon"".  Oddly, ""Heart of Gold"" and ""Old Man"" seem anti-climatic, but are marvelous nonetheless.  His explanation for the latter song is worth checking out.  Seven guitars serenade ""Four Strong Winds,"" (which, incidentally, was one of the tracks on Johnny Cash's last C.D.). Neil Young goes out with big brass on ""One of These Days,"" but not without a couple of intimate moments:  One is ""Needle and the Damage Done,"" (which despite the movie warning, doesn't doing anything but deter drug use).  Then, I believe, it's ""The Old Laughing Lady"" that finds Neil on stage to an empty auditorium.There's little to criticize.  Jonathan Demme deserves credit for capturing this ""golden"" event.  While I would have preferred more shots of supporting players, no one will argue about the focus of this film, and many fans may find that assessment all wet.  The small auditorium and the silent awe for this performance gives the whole affair the intimacy of Orbison in a nightclub setting.  This DVD is a must for fans and the uninitiated alike.

It is more than simply a ""concert DVD,"" which are plentiful and often quite good.  This takes the separate, yet equally appealling (When done properly) audio and video arts and masters them.  The music; the actual concert, is brilliant.  Sometimes, it's breathtaking.  Neil Young is more than a mere rock star, performer or entertainer.  He is the ancient tribal story teller.  He's the philosopher who examines his soul on a daily basis and then translates it to words and music.  This gift allows us to connect to him, not just because some music may be autobiographical, but because he digs deep down and shows us we aren't all as different, or alone as we think.  I once had aspirations to write, but it was the tight, succinct, poignant voices of the great troubadors of our day that finally humbled me to where I finally gave up. People like Young and Dylan have the ability to say more in a sentence than the rest of us could in an entire book!I'm rambling.  If you've every enjoyed Neil Young at all, then just get this.  Order it here, buy the used copy at your local video store, or down at your local Stuff-Mart.  Just buy this DVD.  It is outstanding, full of wonderful surprises and it has given me a much greater, more meaningful respect for this artist I've loved for so many years.  The cinematography; the placement of cameras at the venue, the other elements beside the music and the way it was all put together was ingenious.  I can not say enough about this movie.

982317,A1EKTLUL24HDG8,B000F48D00,Bill R. Moore,"[3, 3]","Neil Young debuted his 2005 album Prairie Wind in special performances for friends, the press, and other insiders at the historic location of Nashville's Grand Ole Opry. Director Jonathan Demme, a frequent collaborator, filmed the results, yielding the magnificent Heart of Gold. An intensely personal, close-up view of Young as well as a great film and performance in itself, it is essential for anyone even remotely interested in Young.Fans will of course be mostly curious about the performance, which is superb. Young plays all of Prairie Wind plus a generous sprinkling of his other country rock-esque cuts with Prairie's excellent band and other long-time partners. He is in top form, singing his proverbial heart out as only he can do and playing great guitar, piano, and harmonica. Very few singers even rival his emotionality and phrasing, and he is as good as ever here; he has lost very little of his voice, especially compared to other singers his age, and certainly none of his intensity or stage presence. This last comes in part from frequent comments delivered in a sincere, seemingly spontaneous manner; some are surprising, even disarming, while others are humorous or revealing, and all are tenderly charming. The band - including standbys like Ben Keith, Spooner Oldham, Rick Rosas, and Chad Cromwell - is also top-notch and gives a truly great performance. Emmylou Harris fans will be thrilled to see her in a prominent role. Prairie is overrated and really only decent but truly seems to come alive here; Young's profound emotion and concentration bring out unexpected subtleties, making several cuts go from decent to good and others from bad to decent. The backing vocals, a prime album defect, are also noticeably improved. Perhaps more fundamentally, Young is the kind of artist who is simply mesmerizing to watch; he has that indefinable but all-important ""something"" that only the best performers have. Reciting his laundry list would be engrossing, and this certainly is. Even better, though, is the encore, which consists mostly of songs from the beloved Harvest and Harvest Moon plus a few from Comes a Time and elsewhere. Young performs some of his best and most popular songs (""Heart of Gold,"" ""The Needle and the Damage Done,"" ""Harvest Moon,"" ""I Am a Child"") as well as lesser-known ones that are often nearly as good. Highlights include ""No Wonder,"" ""It's a Dream,"" ""When God Made Me,"" ""Four Strong Winds,"" and ""One of These Days."" This is quite simply one of Young's best latter-day performances, and having it for posterity is a great treasure.The film is also very well-done as a film. Demme understands Young as few do; he knows how to record his music, and his visual elements are sympathetic. Befitting the songs' simplicity, he keeps things very simple with minimal scenery and avoids distracting effects. He basically lets the music speak for itself, as it always should; unlike so many directors, he does not interrupt or truncate songs. Interviews with Young and other principals are used, and there is a significant amount of footage showing Nashville, the auditorium, etc. However, it is tasteful and respectful; Demme never lets it overwhelm the music, instead accentuating it. The interviews are interesting and informative, revealing much about Young and others, and the additional footage is valuable both as background and on its own often visually arresting terms. Demme's cinematography is also spot-on; he of course focuses on Young but knows when to show others and when close-ups are needed. The few special touches that he does add are first-rate and very fitting. It is worth noting that neither he nor Young refer to Heart as a concert film, and indeed it is atypical. The crowd is never shown, which makes things seem all the more intimate; we feel as if we are watching a very personal rehearsal even with Young's crowd comments and its slight noise. The main effect is lighting; coupled with apparent crowd absence, it gives a very strong dream atmosphere reinforced in the final song. Wardrobes are also very appropriate and even stunning.There are also substantial extras, most of which are high quality. The main feature is the ""Rehearsal Diaries"" narrated by Demme - a fascinating inside peek at every aspect of show preparation. It gives a good idea of Young's notorious perfectionism and thus great insight into him as artist and bandleader. A shorter ""Finishing Touches"" segment does much the same. We also get additional interviews with him and others that are often as good as what was used. Less intriguing but still worthwhile is a segment where long-time Young guitar tech Larry Cragg gives a tour of Young's instruments and a short bit of Young warming up with the legendary Fisk University Jubilee Singers who add their distinctive vocals to ""When God."" Finally, we get Young's famous 1971 Johnny Cash Show performance of ""The Needle"" - a fine take and interesting contrast.One simply could not ask for a better concert film of Young's Nashville songs. The performance is immaculate and the film well-done in every respect. Anyone interested in Young - and not just in these songs - must get it, as it transcends apparently self-imposed limitations and moves into true greatness.",5,Absolutely Essential,1269302400,"03 23,

The concert on this DVD was filmed before the CD was available, and people like me were right to wait for the DVD.  Instead of just hearing the music, you get to see who is playing and singing.  Comments by Neil Young about his father having dementia are as touching as the Bridge School Concerts on a 1997 CD that had notes thanking ""the audiences who have made the Bridge School Concerts possible.""  People who get the DVD `Heart of Gold' have the opportunity to observe first performances of songs that were written as the recording was underway in a public performance that was prepared in the ten days before the musicians took the stage of the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville.  Even if the music is not going to be your favorite song ever, because your mind is now too old to be captured by the complexity of new musical creations, the opportunity to see an old master and his henchmen turning out new songs, remembering all the words, and playing them for an audience which has a sense of the history of the music that has been played on some of the same guitars that are right there on stage, for the first time since 1951, for instance, ought to be appreciated.",5,Great performance,1151020800,"06 23, 2006",2006,1402,"['have', 'more', 'CDs', 'can', 'listen', 'year', 'what', 'see', 'DVD', 'chance', 'stick', 'mind', 'seeing', 'few', 'times', 'have', 'so', 'many', 'Neil', 'Young', 'songs', 'love', 'never', 'convinced', 'buy', 'Prairie', 'Wind', '2005', 'concert', 'DVD', 'was', 'filmed', 'CD', 'was', 'available', 'people', 'were', 'right', 'wait', 'DVD', 'Instead', 'just', 'hearing', 'music', 'get', 'see', 'who', 'playing', 'singing', 'Comments', 'Neil', 'Young', 'father', 'having', 'dementia', 'are', 'as', 'touching', 'Bridge', 'School', 'Concerts', '1997', 'CD', 'had', 'notes', 'thanking', 'audiences', 'who', 'have', 'made', 'Bridge', 'School', 'Concerts', 'possible', 'People', 'who', 'get', 'DVD', 'Heart', 'Gold', 'have', 'opportunity', 'observe', 'first', 'performances', 'songs', 'were', 'written', 'recording', 'was', 'underway', 'public', 'performance', 'was', 'prepared', 'ten', 'days', 'musicians', 'took', 'stage', 'Ryman', 'Auditorium', 'Nashville', 'Even', 'music', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'favorite', 'song', 'ever', 'mind', 'now', 'too', 'old', 'be', 'captured', 'complexity', 'new', 'musical', 'creations', 'opportunity', 'see', 'old', 'master', 'henchmen', 'turning', 'out', 'new', 'songs', 'remembering', 'words', 'playing', 'audience', 'sense', 'history', 'music', 'been', 'played', 'same', 'guitars', 'are', 'right', 'there', 'stage', 'first', 'time', '1951', 'instance', 'ought', 'be', 'appreciated']",N/A
982321,A1HG2DOSBZEX4I,B000F48D00,Bryan A. Pfleeger,"[2, 2]","Jonathan Demme called these performances by Neil Young a dream concert and I would agree. Filmed at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville (also called the mother church of American music) over two nights in 2005 Heart of Gold presents the debut performance of Young's acoustic Prarie Wind album.Working with musicians who are more of a family than simply players the interaction between the people on stage sets this show apart from most of the recent concert documentaries I have seen. Every song is lit specially for maximum effect.

I pre-ordered Heart of Gold from Amazon and received it on Monday (one day before the official release date).  I listened to it as soon as I got home from work and listened to again late that night.  It is the best Neil Young DVD yet and maybe the best performance by him I have ever heard. Maybe we are both getting old, but I was really touched by the way he and his longtime friends just came out and played and sang like they were really enjoying themselves. No arrogant, loud mouth rockstars here. The music was softer, smoother and more touching than any of his previous work. I had assumed that this would be a DVD version of his recent Prarie Wind CD, but it wasn't.  A lot of the songs were the same, but he also played a lot of old stuff that I love, like ""Heart of Gold"" and ""Old Man"".  The most beautiful piece on the DVD is the old folk song ""Four Strong Winds"" with all the guest musicians on stage harmonizing and at least a dozen acoustic guitars all playing together. The cinematography was excellent and you could tell this was being directed by a pro, Johnathn Demme.  If you are a Neil Young fan, you must have this and will love it.  If you are not a Neil Young fan, watch this and you will be.PS:  The DTS soundtrack is incredible and if do not have a DTS surround sound system, get one.

982323,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000F48D00,"Cloud ""...""","[1, 5]","To be perfectly honest: I'm not THAT much of a Neil Young fan. Yeah he's got some good songs and records but for me they tend to be few and far-between. For every great record like Zuma or Harvest he's got tons that simply don't work like Trans, This Note's For You or Are You Passionate. His latest record, Prairie Wind has been hailed as his return-to-form, a classic Neil Young record. He debuted it at the Grand Ole Opry and it's certainly a breath of fresh air from the other concerts available on DVD.Performing his Prairie Wind album live in its entirety as well as some hits, Neil Young takes the stage with his band as well as some guests. No stage trickery like pyrotechnics and laser shows, it's just straight Neil Young and he's quite captivating. Even if certain songs don't gel, there's a aura he is where he's like a calmer kind of intense, he's not energetic or dynamic like most but you almost can't keep your eyes of him. Again, his voice is one of those love-it-or-hate-it deals and while I do like Megadeth and Rush who don't have the most range-y singers, Neil's I can tolerate too.One nice thing about the show is that the editing has finally been given a shot of morphine. Unlike the hyperkinetic cameras of other DVD concerts, this often has loooong shots on Neil or the band and there's a more relaxed feeling about the show and it works because of it. As for the music itself, I don't mind Neil Young but he's not really an artist where every single song he does I'm a fan of, it's more like ""I like this one and that and that but all this? No"".Should you buy this? If you're a Neil Young fan yes. If you're not and want to get into him?

(The stage was on one side of the inside ofthe oval raceway, and I was not far from the front stage left on the field.  There were people of course in thestands, hanging off of anything they could.  They performed much of what was to make it on to the 4-WAY Street Album,which is the album I feel in love with CSN&Y.; The break up was devistating to me. Looking back, it was another side of Neil,as was his Electric side which is not represented here. So if you happen to only like Neil's Electric side, this DVD is not for you.I myself enjoy all of Neil, but I indeed do prefer his electric side.  He has provided us with many DVD's of liveconcerts for his electric side.  He is multi-talented and hence has multiple sides, and he knows how to expressthem in music. How lucky we are!  I wish some other artists I grew up with in the 70's as a person born nearthe tail of the baby boom would come to life like this on DVD.Sadly they are not all around anymore, or the technology during the 70's does not do justice to Hi-Def780/1080 video and 5.1/7.1 or DTS audio encoding. :(  With Neil, we are lucky his career has extendedover 3 decades.I love acoustic neil, but I will always remember Rocking in the free world, when even us New Yorkers wereSouthern men, and wont forget the Vietnam War, Kent State, or the four that died in Ohio on the electric side,and when I hear the acoustic side remember those 4 guys up on stage, nervous, knees knocking,when they performed at Woodstock.I can never help but wonder what would have happened if CSN&Y; hadstayed together. Would we have missed all the great sides we have seen of Neil? Or would they have stillcome out only along with the added talents of David Crosby, Stephen Stills and Graham Nash??

The stealth emotional impact was by design, Young says: ""They think they're watching a concert and they come out wondering what happened.""The songs (and film) were touched by Young's near-fatal aneurysm and his father's death.

This is a more subdued, contemplative Neil Young playing to a Nashville audience at the historic Ryman Auditorium, and at one point introducing ""This Old Guitar"" as the same one played by Hank Williams back in 1951. He covers a number of interesting tracks including ""Four Strong Winds"" by Ian Tyson, recalling his Canadian home, and a fun duet with Emmylou on ""Old King,"" with Neil playing banjo.  The band is an interesting mix, including his mainstays, but also featuring Emmylou Harris, his wife Pegi, the Memphis Horns and the Fisk University Jubilee Singers.  The concert is beautifully filmed by Jonathon Demme with plenty of warm tones, closing with Neil alone on stage singing ""The Old Laughing Lady"" as the credits roll slowly by.  The extras are fun to watch as well, especially a piece from the 1971 Johnny Cash Show, in which a young Neil plays ""Needle And The Damage Done,"" which he also plays in the concert.

The behind the scene footage is wonderful. What I probably love most about this DVD is the interviews with band members, especially Ben Keith. Ben has played with Neil off and on for over thirty years. Ben is famous for his steel guitar on Harvest, ie ""Heart of Gold"". I love these perspectives from these band members because a person is only as successful because of who he has around him. Now the show. What better place to shoot a DVD than the ORIGINAL Grand Ole Opry. His choice of music is outstanding, especially the live performance of Heart of Gold. A live performance of Heart of Gold is rare, unless you are fortunate enough to have a copy of Austin City Limits, or the BBC performance. Neil will be forever associated with that song and for some reason he doesn't like that. So I am very glad to see HOG available for purchase on DVD. The only problem I had with the DVD was the bonus live performance. The Needle and The Damage Done is abundantly available on video. The Johnny Cash show version might night be, but it is available on just about every Neil concert video, plus Live Aid, SNL, among others.

This concert, performed at the legendary Ryman Auditorium (venerable home of the Grand Ol' Opry), has the close, warm intimate feel of an early-1960s coffeehouse gig.Neil opens HEART OF GOLD with a series of talented renditions of his then most-recent work. Somewhere along the way this show suddenly transcends itself; the confessional asides to the audience, the mellowness of the acoustics, the cathedral-like setting, all coalesce into a seamless whole. Exactly when and why this happens is impossible to pin down. Perhaps the fact that Neil was facing an imminent potentially life ending brain surgery for an aneurysm brought a depth and an honesty to the performance that it might not otherwise have had. Perhaps the fact that he had just lost his father put him into a reflective state of mind. Perhaps the fact that Neil Young is an effortless musician with absolutely no affectation allowed the fourth wall to melt away.Who knows? Who cares?

982347,A13FBTZ8SO8T3D,B000F48D00,o dubhthaigh,"[27, 27]","There is a lot to recommend this film - Young's best music in a very long time, the twin passionate motivators of his father's passing from dementia and his own brush with an aneurism, the brilliant musicianship of all the support players, and perhaps most importantly, Emmylou Harris. (hopefully there will be some additional material on the dvd)I can't think of any better pairing in music than these two, and it has always been that way. More so than with CSN, CH, whatever garbanzo group he cobblers together, the moment he and Harris collaborate, whatever the song, it takes on a majesty that is unsurpassed in my ears. In all honesty, in this film, Harris is riveting. It is as much her film, in a supporting role, as it is Young's, and that is without attempting to grandstand. It is the pairing that does it.The first half of the film is devoted to PRAIRIE WIND, its recording and presentation on stage. Demme delivers as impressive a tableaux for Neil as he did for Talking Heads. You'd forget altogether the coked stumble bum of THE LAST WALTZ, or even the crazed Dylan uber-fan from the Zimmerman tribute. Demme gets up close with Neil and lets his sardonnic humour shine through. To Young's credit, he knows the camera is there and slyly mocks it, and the whole genre of concert footage. At the opening he explains he never asks for any particular musicians and just goes with the flow of who is assembled. Then all of the supporting players tell how he has explicitly asked for them. It is just a perfect example of an extraordinarily dry wit who, as he explains in the background of the story about Louis Avila, ""I'm just lucky, I guess.""The second half of the film reminds you just how powerful his country-folk-rock material is, be it the incredible take on ""Four Strong Winds"" (any Canadian kid worth his salt knows this better than O Canada), the aforementioned ""Old Man,"" the acknowledgement to Nicollete Larsen with ""Lotta Love,"" or the show stopping tour de force song to his dog with Emmylou matching him rif for rif and harmonizing like her life depended on it. The instensity of these two locked in on this song especially, but in nearly every song she's featured in, takes this concert to a place almost no other Neil Young concert I have ever seen reaches. There is a point in STOP MAKING SENSE where you wonder can the band can be any more incendiary than it is. You'll hit that same point with Young's canine ode. In fairness, everyone in the band is on fire by that point, it's just that Harris and Young take this terrific tune to the temple of the gods and offer it up to Music itself.

982356,A387BD735MI50R,B000F48D00,R. Schultz,"[10, 12]","Neil Young presents his characteristic childlike tracery of tunes here. Sometimes these new songs he wrote seem almost too simple and improvised. I was reminded of a five-year-old, wanting attention, standing in the center of the room singing, adding stanza after stanza to avoid having to leave the limelight. ""And then you said... and then you went to the door...""But as you let these songs seep into you, you realize they really aren't something your five-year-old could have or would have written. It's like some modern art. No, your child couldn't have painted these pieces. Neil Young is the Paul Klee of song. His music may seem like the separate colored pieces of a child's mobile dangling overhead. But the best of them, the ones that are not political but are deeply personal, are the product of a mature adult looking back with the innocence of a child. And these tendrils of song end up being capable of climbing the stoniest of walls, taking root there, and surviving.This movie is a photographic record of Young's inaugural presentation of his Prairie Winds album before a live audience at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville. It's an adult movie in that it would appeal to a viewer who doesn't require lots of special effects, lots of teenage blast and bluster from a concert. It's a concentration on individual faces, on an individual voice.The photography is pure gold. Neil Young, his back-up singers, and his band members are shown in close-up, bathed in warm, buttery light. It's beautiful to behold.There are two discs in the DVD release of this movie. The one disc is devoted to extras. It includes footage of rehearsals, and various commentaries from band members as they are being driven around Nashville to jog reflections on their long careers with Neil Young. Some of these commentaries tend to be a little reminiscent of This is Spinal Tap. Aren't all pop band reminiscences? It's always a reaching for some profound biographical insights that don't exist. ""Yeah man, I remember how he came into the store that day... I'll never forget...""It is interesting to see the old Ryman Auditorium restored to its fully glory and to hear something of its history. But perhaps the most interesting segment among the extras is the run-down of the various guitars Neil Young and the other band members use in their concerts - and the biographies of these guitars. The guitars seem to have more personality outside the concert performance than the humans do.So in general, stick to the music in this movie.

982360,A10RPSCHRATNNN,B000F48D00,Will Allen III,"[5, 6]","First, a confession:  I was a big Neil Young Fan when I was young.  I am now 59.  Over thirty years have passed, and I lost touch with him as a musician while my musical taste led me to classic jazz and Delta blues.  (For over five years in the 90s I was the Executive Producer for Robert Parker's Jazz Classics In Stereo weekly one hour radio programs on Public Radio International.)Neil Young recently came back to my attention as one of the owners and  developers of a fantastic new electronic control system for Lionel O-gauge model trains called the Legacy system.  As a model railroader, I was impressed with the product and especially by Mr. Young's attention to his customer base and commitment to improving the product through direct customer feedback.  He is completely open to criticism and inculcates all valid issues into product optimization.  Who does that these days?Since his music was important to me when I was young and stupid, would it still be, I wondered, now that I am old and stupid?So I started digging around to see where his career had led him, and I came across this DVD, Heart Of Gold, and I bought it to reacquaint myself with the man and his music.  It is a film of Mr. Young's 2006 performance, with friends such as Emmylou Harris, in Nashville, and it was directed by Jonathan Demme, famous for movies like Silence of the Lambs.I was unprepared for my reaction to Mr. Young's performance.Simply put, it is stunningly beautiful music that comes across, as my title says, utterly sincere.  Mr. Young's youthful eclectic creativity has grown and matured.  His instrumental and vocal deliveries are deeply emotional without being in the least affected.  His songs are tone poems.  His on-stage fellow performers are all close friends who share his inner rhythm and his dreams, and it shows.  Their musicianship is as perfected as Mr. Young's, and in absolute harmony.The result is something rare and difficult to describe.  The music and the performances are ethereal and deeply moving.
