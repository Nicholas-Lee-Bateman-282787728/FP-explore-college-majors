1671566,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B00FGG60XY,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[1, 3]","When Roy is asked to help plan the wedding of his friend Alana, he hesitates at first, because it means facing Alana&#8217;s adopted brother Paul, a former alcoholic with whom he had a nasty breakup.  He asks his friend Gavin to come along and pose as his boyfriend.  Complications set in when the now-sober Paul seems to have lots in common with the (actually single) Gavin.One of the many reasons I love this film is that it is not a &#8220;gay film&#8221;, per se, although it has the aforementioned openly gay characters.  They are just part of a great ensemble cast of family (and &#8220;family&#8221;), with their sexuality just a minor detail in the qualities the group celebrates in each other.  The story touches on love and dedication, remembering the things that are truly important in life, and actually deals with changes in a marriage from years ago (Paul and Alana&#8217;s parents, played by character actors Kristine Sutherland and James Rebhorn), Alana and her fianc&eacute;&#8217;, as well as another marriage proposal still to come.  This is a heartwarming, amusing story that gay viewers do not have to hesitate a second to share with family and straight friends.DVD includes a &#8220;making of&#8221; featurette, and interviews with actors and a director/screenwriter.  Not rated, but would not likely be anything stronger than a PG-13.

It's also about the planning of a wedding for Paul's sister, who really just wants a small wedding, but her mother is planning on a big one. It's also about Paul's parents and their coming to terms with the fact the husband is in the beginning stages of Alzheimer's. The movie is somewhat predictable, and turned out like I thought for the most part. I consider it t be much more romantic than a comedy. However, part of this movie left me feeling sad personally for Roy, mainly because I experienced a somewhat similar, yet different situation with a guy I was interested in and a friend getting together. I identify more with Roy, and got the feeling that Roy secretly wanted Paul back. It seemed he realized this after Paul gave a very sincere, heartfelt apology for cheating on him before, and how he's turning his life around. There was a scene where Roy was looking for Gavin, but he found Paul instead. And Roy mentioned that he feels it's great that Paul is turning his life around. You get the feeling that Roy is about to say something more (possibly about getting back together), but then Roy is called away. Then when Paul's sister got married, Roy noticed a certain chemistry between Paul and Gavin. And also Roy seemed to be smiling as he saw Paul dancing at his sister's wedding, as though maybe he was starting to fall in love with him again. However in the end when Gavin left, Paul's sister suggested about Roy and Paul getting back together. I think Paul would have liked to say yes, but he put aside his feelings, knowing that Paul and Gavin had more of a chemistry going on between each other and were perhaps better suited for each other.This is definitely a movie you should see.",5,Very heartwarming movie,1388793600,"01 4, 2014",2014,1795,"['movie', 'not', 'just', 'Paul', 'Gavin', 'getting', 'know', 'one', 'other', 'also', 'planning', 'wedding', 'Paul', 'sister', 'who', 'really', 'just', 'small', 'wedding', 'mother', 'planning', 'big', 'one', 'also', 'Paul', 'parents', 'coming', 'terms', 'fact', 'husband', 'beginning', 'stages', 'Alzheimer', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'predictable', 'turned', 'out', 'thought', 'most', 'part', 'consider', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'However', 'part', 'movie', 'left', 'feeling', 'sad', 'personally', 'Roy', 'mainly', 'experienced', 'somewhat', 'similar', 'yet', 'different', 'situation', 'guy', 'was', 'interested', 'friend', 'getting', 'together', 'identify', 'more', 'Roy', 'got', 'feeling', 'Roy', 'secretly', 'wanted', 'Paul', 'back', 'seemed', 'realized', 'Paul', 'gave', 'very', 'sincere', 'heartfelt', 'apology', 'cheating', 'how', 'turning', 'life', 'around', 'was', 'scene', 'where', 'Roy', 'was', 'looking', 'Gavin', 'found', 'Paul', 'instead', 'Roy', 'mentioned', 'great', 'Paul', 'turning', 'life', 'around', 'get', 'feeling', 'Roy', 'say', 'something', 'more', 'possibly', 'getting', 'back', 'together', 'then', 'Roy', 'called', 'away', 'Then', 'when', 'Paul', 'sister', 'got', 'married', 'Roy', 'noticed', 'certain', 'chemistry', 'Paul', 'Gavin', 'also', 'Roy', 'seemed', 'be', 'smiling', 'saw', 'Paul', 'dancing', 'sister', 'wedding', 'maybe', 'was', 'starting', 'fall', 'love', 'again', 'However', 'end', 'when', 'Gavin', 'left', 'Paul', 'sister', 'suggested', 'Roy', 'Paul', 'getting', 'back', 'together', 'think', 'Paul', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'say', 'yes', 'put', 'aside', 'feelings', 'knowing', 'Paul', 'Gavin', 'had', 'more', 'chemistry', 'going', 'other', 'were', 'perhaps', 'better', 'suited', 'other.This', 'definitely', 'movie', 'should', 'see']",The Perfect Wedding

1671570,A25L1GQF65K55K,B00FGG60XY,Craig Haynes,"[20, 21]","The Perfect Wedding is the most perfect romantic charmer I've seen in a long time. Kudos to the writers for giving us a story with some depth and respect for the human condition, which as we know, is far from 'perfect.' I disagree with reviewers who claim the movie is ""light"" ""fluffy."" Though the writers and director handle the heavy stuff with a light touch, there is nothing fluffy about substance abuse recovery or Alzheimer disease. Paul, the recovering alcoholic and serial relationship killer, struggles. His sister struggles with being honest with her mother regarding HER wishes for her upcoming wedding plans. Their parents struggle with a debilitating disease...YET in the midst of all this struggling, they find and discover a deep and abiding love and respect for one another. One of the most romantic and honest declarations of love I've seen on film is in this little indie. Eric Aragon (Paul) delivers a solid performance, and doesn't disappoint in this touching and high moment in the film. What a sweet picture. And the ending provides a wonderful poetic irony that even this hardcore cynic had to give a shout-out.  The editing is excellent, the cinematography beautiful (love Sarasota, Florida--been there and love it in this movie). On a political note, that this film was shot in Florida (anti-gay marriage; anti-mixed adoption), may be a political statement. Not sure if that's what the writers and director intended, but I thought I'd point that out. The the lead characters are adopted across ethnic, racial lines. In addition, a gay marriage takes place there (presumably--at least in the movie). Rent it, enjoy it and tell your friends.",4,Absolutely charming !

1671586,A2GV62JPB5RJSC,B00FGG60XY,Ronald N. Tan,"[11, 14]","The cast, crew, and the director have told a wonderful romantic story that does NOT involve any crude language or unnecessary gratuitous shots that seems popular in gay movies. I truly believe that more movies like this be made and available to the open-minded general audience. The story is kind of &#34;cheesy&#34; and the ending was expected. I thought the journey of watching the film was worthwhile. Definite a movie to cozy up and watch with a date (if you happened to be gay) or enjoy a romantic movie that happens to center on a gay-themed romance.As others have said, the acting chemistry between Gavin (Gaffney) and Paul (Aragon) were real and as an openly gay man, the character of Gavin is the ideal partner for me. Thank you Mr. Gaffney for portraying and making Gavin real and attainable. My favorite scene in the movie is where the family was playing Charades&#8212;I can't stand that game! The ideal partner is someone who could complete your sentences or &#34;get you&#34; when no one understands you. In the scene, Paul played out the Mona Lisa scene from &#34;Da Vinci Code.&#34; While the rest of his family had no clue, Gavin jump up and exclaimed the correct answer.I love it! I truly do. I hope to see more of Mr. Gaffney on challenging film projects, not just gay movies. Sometimes, gay movies are &#34;limited&#34; in budget and character depth development. I really would like to see Mr. Gaffney work with higher-tier directors to really hone and further bringing out his skillset and maturation as a professional actor.",5,The Perfect Gay Romantic Movie for Christmas,1386892800,"12 13, 2013",2013,1546,"['cast', 'crew', 'director', 'have', 'told', 'wonderful', 'romantic', 'story', 'NOT', 'involve', 'crude', 'language', 'unnecessary', 'gratuitous', 'shots', 'popular', 'gay', 'movies', 'truly', 'believe', 'more', 'movies', 'be', 'made', 'available', 'open-minded', 'general', 'audience', 'story', 'kind', '34', 'cheesy', '34', 'ending', 'was', 'expected', 'thought', 'journey', 'watching', 'film', 'was', 'worthwhile', 'Definite', 'movie', 'cozy', 'up', 'watch', 'date', 'happened', 'be', 'gay', 'enjoy', 'romantic', 'movie', 'center', 'gay-themed', 'romance.As', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'acting', 'chemistry', 'Gavin', 'Gaffney', 'Paul', 'Aragon', 'were', 'real', 'openly', 'gay', 'man', 'character', 'Gavin', 'ideal', 'partner', 'Thank', 'Mr.', 'Gaffney', 'portraying', 'making', 'Gavin', 'real', 'attainable', 'favorite', 'scene', 'movie', 'where', 'family', 'was', 'playing', 'Charades', '8212', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'game', 'ideal', 'partner', 'someone', 'who', 'could', 'complete', 'sentences', '34', 'get', '34', 'when', 'one', 'scene', 'Paul', 'played', 'out', 'Mona', 'Lisa', 'scene', '34', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code.', '34', 'rest', 'family', 'had', 'clue', 'Gavin', 'jump', 'up', 'exclaimed', 'correct', 'answer.I', 'love', 'truly', 'do', 'hope', 'see', 'more', 'Mr.', 'Gaffney', 'challenging', 'film', 'projects', 'not', 'just', 'gay', 'movies', 'Sometimes', 'gay', 'movies', 'are', '34', 'limited', '34', 'budget', 'character', 'depth', 'development', 'really', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'Mr.', 'Gaffney', 'work', 'higher-tier', 'directors', 'really', 'hone', 'further', 'bringing', 'out', 'skillset', 'maturation', 'professional', 'actor']",The Perfect Wedding
