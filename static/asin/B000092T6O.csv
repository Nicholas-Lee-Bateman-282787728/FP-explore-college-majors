751411,A3JMWIOTUBOJI7,B000092T6O,Donkey Dick,"[19, 20]","Aside from its refreshingly stripped-down plot, MONTANA is a pretty complex film. I say this because it works on so many levels, and is essentially impossible to pigeonhole stylistically. I suppose it's a crime drama more than anything else, but it's also hilarious, very violent, and not without a healthy dose of action fireworks.Kyra Sedgewick is amazing as Claire, the only female part of a syndicate of hitmen. Her partner and possible love interest is terminally ill Nick (also played to perfection by Stanley Tucci). In charge of the whole operation is The Boss (Robbie Coltrane), and his assistant, Duncan (Philip Seymour Hoffman). When the Boss's mistress, Kitty (Robin Tunney) runs off, he sends Claire and his son, Jimmy (Ethan Embry), to go retrieve her. Once they find her, Jimmy attempts to rape her, and with nothing else to lose, Kitty shoots him in the head. This, of course, puts Claire in a very bad position.Every aspect of this film is great. The screenplay (by Erich and Jon Hoeber) is witty, quick, very real, and devoid of convention. Leitzes's direction is down-to-earth, but hardly amateurish, and again, lacking any indie arrogance or MTV trickery. And you couldn't ask for a better group of actors -- there's a real chemistry there.MONTANA is not going to change your life, but it is a truly exceptional film, and should certainly be unearthed from obscurity.",5,More people need to see this.,1090454400,"07 22, 2004",2004,1387,"['Aside', 'refreshingly', 'stripped-down', 'plot', 'MONTANA', 'pretty', 'complex', 'film', 'say', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'essentially', 'impossible', 'pigeonhole', 'stylistically', 'suppose', 'crime', 'drama', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'also', 'hilarious', 'very', 'violent', 'not', 'healthy', 'dose', 'action', 'fireworks.Kyra', 'Sedgewick', 'amazing', 'Claire', 'only', 'female', 'part', 'syndicate', 'hitmen', 'partner', 'possible', 'love', 'interest', 'terminally', 'ill', 'Nick', 'also', 'played', 'perfection', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'charge', 'whole', 'operation', 'Boss', 'Robbie', 'Coltrane', 'assistant', 'Duncan', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'When', 'Boss', 'mistress', 'Kitty', 'Robin', 'Tunney', 'off', 'Claire', 'son', 'Jimmy', 'Ethan', 'Embry', 'go', 'retrieve', 'find', 'Jimmy', 'rape', 'nothing', 'else', 'lose', 'Kitty', 'shoots', 'head', 'course', 'Claire', 'very', 'bad', 'position.Every', 'aspect', 'film', 'great', 'screenplay', 'Erich', 'Jon', 'Hoeber', 'witty', 'quick', 'very', 'real', 'devoid', 'convention', 'Leitzes', 'direction', 'down-to-earth', 'hardly', 'amateurish', 'again', 'lacking', 'indie', 'arrogance', 'MTV', 'trickery', 'could', ""n't"", 'ask', 'better', 'group', 'actors', 'real', 'chemistry', 'there.MONTANA', 'not', 'going', 'change', 'life', 'truly', 'exceptional', 'film', 'should', 'certainly', 'be', 'unearthed', 'obscurity']",Montana
751412,A356RFKNIG043B,B000092T6O,K. Swanson,"[0, 0]","There are many weak moments here, in writing, acting and directing. At least it's consistent! At first the script is decent and the actors ok, but the director is bringing nothing to the table. Then the writing and acting start to falter but the director begins warming to his task (maybe realizing this film has NO HEART) and tries to spice things up with a few nice shots and starts blocking scenes more wisely. By the end, however, the mish-mash nature of it all took me nowhere.There's not one character to care about, which is what makes crime dramadies worth seeing: feeling for people you normally could not. But here everyone is unsavory and if I don't like even one character, why should I care what happens to them? [Spoiler coming...] That they all die excepting one or two makes it even less pleasant.The only highlights for me were Hoffman and Ritter, both of whom excel as sleazy bastards, and add some of the only relief, comic or otherwise, in this film. Sedgwick is weak and unconvincing and Tucci is better but still merely competent. Their romance has no spark and feels posed.There are many many better movies of this sort around.

751413,AL2Q8YF4HB33,B000092T6O,"MarianaP ""marianap""","[7, 8]","I liked the laid back feel it has.What I remember most about the movie is the couple and their relationship. I like them because they are witty and strong, and they love each other in a sweet, loyal way that is the total opposite of the saccharine, phony romances I keep seeing in Hollywood films. They are grown-ups and they look like real people and they're charismatic individuals. That's a very needed break from all the bratty, spoiled silly, no-brain teenage movies the movie industry tries (to no avail) to force down my throat.If it were a samurai movie or something, placed in such an alien and exotic place that your moral code somehow doesn't apply anymore, I wouldn't wonder ""Why am I rooting and feeling for a couple or payed assassins?"" But although it is placed in our world and our time it's like it's another dimension where it's OK for criminals to be talking to you about morals. They make me want to believe, which just might be the best compliment one can pay to a movie.I would definitely buy it.
