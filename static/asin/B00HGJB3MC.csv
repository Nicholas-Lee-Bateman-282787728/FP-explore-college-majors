1689497,AUSZNRZ3DVX1Q,B00HGJB3MC,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","This is a Russian film of the Great Patriotic War. There is a strong undercurrent of Russian conservative viewpoint. It is almost Stalinist, which is appropriate for the time and place, but a little scary for current events. The story is some spin doctoring of an actual incident during the battle for Stalingrad. All the major character's are very well portrayed by a talented cast. These are very Russian characters, so don't expect to see the hollyweird stereotypes you normally get and expect in a war movie. There are a couple of combat scenes here that hollyweird could learn a few things from. One of which will haunt me for years to come. The only flaws were why not tell the true story? And the Germans who are no where near as well rounded and realized as the Russians.

Stalingrad was after Moscow the biggest battle on the Eastern Front, and it certainly was a very significant one. It was not however, a battle for freedom, on one side was Stalin and the other was Hitler. I doubt under Stalin that a Russian soldier would dare to say some of the things these soldiers say. Having said this clearly the director did pay attention to the way weapons are used in battle.  Clearly, he had access to a decent military adviser. Although the story itself seems to be a loose adaption of the battle at Pavlov's House, Vasily Zaytsev experiences and another scene at the Stalingrad railway station.The story itself, I found weak. It is really two stories of a German captain who is having an affair with a Russian woman and five Russian soldiers who adopt a Russian woman. I confess this just bored me.The actor I really liked is Thomas Kretschmann, who seems to be making a career of doing films about Stalingrad. Although I believe some of the others were good too. I think it was a case where the story let them down.Would I recommend it, well I did to my elders who lived though the war in that area but no-one else.

1689502,A2POYXTGSPSW7O,B00HGJB3MC,Bill Hensler,"[4, 4]","I like most movies about the Soviet & German WWII conflict.  One of the better is the old movieCross of Iron (Widescreen Special Edition), a fair movie with a fair story.This movie is a cross between ""300"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"" , some effects from ""The Matrix"" tossed in, with none of the story of any.  Basically, it's about a group of Soviet soldiers who keep a house from falling into the German's hands.  This house is next to the Volga river so it's of strategic importance; the Russian can keep a beachhead in Stalingrad.I have sympathy for the Russians but they come across as brutes.  The Germans seem too old for the job; the actor who is a company commander is pushing over 40.  The old moveEnemy At The Gatesdoes a far better job of showing both sides fighting and interaction with the civilians.The story is narrated by the grown child of a woman from the house that is the center of the fighting.  He tells his story to a German woman trapped in the wreckage of an earthquake struck house in China or Japan.  It is the story of a woman saved by a group of Soviet soldiers and how they keep open a path for the Russian forces to reenforce Stalingrad.This movie is a Russian attempt at modern movie making.  It just can't make it for any educated viewer.  The older Soviet propaganda movies are better, modern slow motion computer effects don't add to the script, and the cardboard German bad guys act like they are refugees from some anti-military American Vietnam movie.I had high hopes for this movie but can only give it one star.",1,Just plain bad,1403568000,"06 24, 2014",2014,1549,"['like', 'most', 'movies', 'Soviet', 'German', 'WWII', 'conflict', 'One', 'better', 'old', 'movieCross', 'Iron', 'Widescreen', 'Special', 'Edition', 'fair', 'movie', 'fair', 'story.This', 'movie', 'cross', '300', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'effects', 'Matrix', 'tossed', 'none', 'story', 'Basically', 'group', 'Soviet', 'soldiers', 'who', 'keep', 'house', 'falling', 'German', 'hands', 'house', 'next', 'Volga', 'river', 'strategic', 'importance', 'Russian', 'can', 'keep', 'beachhead', 'Stalingrad.I', 'have', 'sympathy', 'Russians', 'come', 'brutes', 'Germans', 'seem', 'too', 'old', 'job', 'actor', 'who', 'company', 'commander', 'pushing', '40', 'old', 'moveEnemy', 'Gatesdoes', 'far', 'better', 'job', 'showing', 'sides', 'fighting', 'interaction', 'civilians.The', 'story', 'narrated', 'grown', 'child', 'woman', 'house', 'center', 'fighting', 'story', 'German', 'woman', 'trapped', 'wreckage', 'earthquake', 'struck', 'house', 'China', 'Japan', 'story', 'woman', 'saved', 'group', 'Soviet', 'soldiers', 'how', 'keep', 'open', 'path', 'Russian', 'forces', 'reenforce', 'Stalingrad.This', 'movie', 'Russian', 'attempt', 'modern', 'movie', 'making', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'educated', 'viewer', 'older', 'Soviet', 'propaganda', 'movies', 'are', 'better', 'modern', 'slow', 'motion', 'computer', 'effects', 'do', ""n't"", 'add', 'script', 'cardboard', 'German', 'bad', 'guys', 'act', 'are', 'refugees', 'anti-military', 'American', 'Vietnam', 'movie.I', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'movie', 'can', 'only', 'give', 'one', 'star']",Stalingrad [World War II] [English Subtitles] [2013]
1689503,ADDNMC77PJBRD,B00HGJB3MC,bjamnjm,"[4, 5]","Being an avid, albeit, amateur historian & having read historical accounts, official battle reports, & correspondence from regular soldiers I expected much, much more from this film.  Instead of portraying the battle which was dramatic enough this retelling attempts to connect present w/past through such an incredibly convoluted transition that I, as others, wondered if either I or Amazon had erred in movie selection.Then the battle itself... we've got the five fathers in a building in Stalingrad that also houses the woman, all five men have an affair with.  It is important to remind the casual observer the Uncle Joe Stalin decided not to allow the inhabitants of Stalingrad to evacuate rationalizing instead that Soviet forces would fight harder w/innocent civilians caught in the middle of the battle.Then there are the thoughtful, humane idealists in this squad who get angry when a Soviet soldier shoots a German soldier while the latter is getting a drink of water.  You have the fiercely motivated, patriotic Soviet soldiers burning from head to toe yet rushing the enemy lines determined to kill the invaders before dying, right.  B/c people whose flesh is burning from head to toe aren't consumed w/escaping the flames rather following orders until dead...Then we have the combat training of the squad which operating like a seasoned, cohesive fire team adept at close quarters combat as opposed to conscripts.Then there's the German's... evil, many times referring to pushing their territorial conquest all the way to India?  Now this was the 1st I'd ever heard of Wehrmacht soldiers casually discussing a push all the way to India.This movie involved nothing of the greater battle for Stalingrad, how the Soviets successfully attacked Romanian & Italian troops guarding severely overextended supply lines thus cutting off the Wehrmacht, trapping it & starving it to death in Stalingrad until it capitulated thus of the ~285,000 soldiers in the 6th Army, ~ 91,000 surrendered to Soviet forces.  They were paraded through Moscow & into the Gulags.  Of the original 300K men in 6th Army only ~ 5,000 returned home & many of those 5-10 years or more after wars end.The Stalingrad defeat was magnified for the Axis powers defeat a few months later in North Africa when roughly a similar size force (285,000 German & Italian soldiers) were taken into captivity.Stalingrad has often been referred to as the most severely battle damaged city of WWII, however, I would suggest Leningrad, Warsaw, Rotterdam, Berlin, Dresden, Manilla, Tokyo & countless other Japanese cities as well as Nanking & countless Chinese cities.  However the two most damaged cities of the war are widely regarded as Warsaw & Manilla.Additionally, the Soviets benefited from having a single front, albeit a large one.  Many a Russian has suggested they could have defeated Germany alone but I wonder when Germany's war making capacity was bombed night & day w/o regard for allied life from ~ '42 until wars end.  Additionally, the bombing campaign alone drew much of the Luftwaffe back from the eastern front to protect Germany's war making capacity.  Additionally, there were the constant flow of supplies from the US into the Soviet Union.Indeed, the Soviet Union ought to be grateful Winston Churchill refused to &#34;make a deal&#34; w/the Hitler & that European Axis forces & Japanese ones never acted cohesively or the USSR would have fought a two front war.  If the Nazi forces had allied w/the Ukraine instead of subjugating them, the Eastern Front of the European Theatre of WWII or the USSr's &#34;Great Patriotic War&#34; may well have gone differently.Anyway, I'm baffled at the good ratings this movie has received.",1,"Boring, Convoluted, Lacked Focus",1403654400,"06 25, 2014",2014,3711,"['Being', 'avid', 'albeit', 'amateur', 'historian', 'having', 'read', 'historical', 'accounts', 'official', 'battle', 'reports', 'correspondence', 'regular', 'soldiers', 'expected', 'much', 'much', 'more', 'film', 'Instead', 'portraying', 'battle', 'was', 'dramatic', 'enough', 'retelling', 'attempts', 'connect', 'present', 'w/past', 'incredibly', 'convoluted', 'transition', 'others', 'wondered', 'Amazon', 'had', 'erred', 'movie', 'selection.Then', 'battle', ""'ve"", 'got', 'five', 'fathers', 'building', 'Stalingrad', 'also', 'houses', 'woman', 'five', 'men', 'have', 'affair', 'important', 'remind', 'casual', 'Uncle', 'Joe', 'Stalin', 'decided', 'not', 'allow', 'inhabitants', 'Stalingrad', 'evacuate', 'rationalizing', 'instead', 'Soviet', 'forces', 'would', 'fight', 'harder', 'w/innocent', 'civilians', 'caught', 'middle', 'battle.Then', 'are', 'thoughtful', 'humane', 'idealists', 'squad', 'who', 'get', 'angry', 'when', 'Soviet', 'soldier', 'German', 'soldier', 'latter', 'getting', 'drink', 'water', 'have', 'fiercely', 'motivated', 'patriotic', 'Soviet', 'soldiers', 'burning', 'head', 'toe', 'yet', 'rushing', 'enemy', 'lines', 'determined', 'kill', 'invaders', 'dying', 'right', 'B/c', 'people', 'flesh', 'burning', 'head', 'toe', 'are', ""n't"", 'consumed', 'w/escaping', 'flames', 'rather', 'following', 'orders', 'dead', 'Then', 'have', 'combat', 'training', 'squad', 'operating', 'seasoned', 'cohesive', 'fire', 'team', 'adept', 'close', 'quarters', 'combat', 'opposed', 'conscripts.Then', 'German', 'evil', 'many', 'times', 'referring', 'pushing', 'territorial', 'conquest', 'way', 'India', 'Now', 'was', '1st', ""'d"", 'ever', 'heard', 'Wehrmacht', 'soldiers', 'casually', 'discussing', 'push', 'way', 'India.This', 'movie', 'involved', 'nothing', 'greater', 'battle', 'Stalingrad', 'how', 'Soviets', 'successfully', 'attacked', 'Romanian', 'Italian', 'troops', 'guarding', 'severely', 'overextended', 'supply', 'lines', 'thus', 'cutting', 'off', 'Wehrmacht', 'trapping', 'starving', 'death', 'Stalingrad', 'capitulated', 'thus', '~285,000', 'soldiers', '6th', 'Army', '~', '91,000', 'surrendered', 'Soviet', 'forces', 'were', 'paraded', 'Moscow', 'Gulags', 'original', '300K', 'men', '6th', 'Army', 'only', '5,000', 'returned', 'home', 'many', '5-10', 'years', 'more', 'wars', 'end.The', 'Stalingrad', 'defeat', 'was', 'magnified', 'Axis', 'powers', 'defeat', 'few', 'months', 'later', 'North', 'Africa', 'when', 'roughly', 'similar', 'size', 'force', '285,000', 'German', 'Italian', 'soldiers', 'were', 'taken', 'captivity.Stalingrad', 'often', 'been', 'referred', 'most', 'severely', 'battle', 'damaged', 'city', 'WWII', 'however', 'would', 'suggest', 'Leningrad', 'Warsaw', 'Rotterdam', 'Berlin', 'Dresden', 'Manilla', 'Tokyo', 'countless', 'other', 'Japanese', 'cities', 'as', 'well', 'Nanking', 'countless', 'Chinese', 'cities', 'However', 'two', 'most', 'damaged', 'cities', 'war', 'are', 'widely', 'regarded', 'Warsaw', 'Manilla.Additionally', 'Soviets', 'benefited', 'having', 'single', 'front', 'large', 'one', 'Many', 'Russian', 'suggested', 'could', 'have', 'defeated', 'Germany', 'alone', 'wonder', 'when', 'Germany', 'war', 'making', 'capacity', 'was', 'bombed', 'night', 'day', 'regard', 'allied', 'life', '~', 'wars', 'end', 'Additionally', 'bombing', 'campaign', 'alone', 'drew', 'much', 'Luftwaffe', 'back', 'eastern', 'front', 'protect', 'Germany', 'war', 'making', 'capacity', 'Additionally', 'were', 'constant', 'flow', 'supplies', 'US', 'Soviet', 'Union.Indeed', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'ought', 'be', 'grateful', 'Winston', 'Churchill', 'refused', '34', 'make', 'deal', '34', 'Hitler', 'European', 'Axis', 'forces', 'Japanese', 'ones', 'never', 'acted', 'cohesively', 'USSR', 'would', 'have', 'fought', 'two', 'front', 'war', 'Nazi', 'forces', 'had', 'allied', 'w/the', 'Ukraine', 'instead', 'subjugating', 'Eastern', 'Front', 'European', 'Theatre', 'WWII', 'USSr', '34', 'Great', 'Patriotic', 'War', '34', 'may', 'well', 'have', 'gone', 'differently.Anyway', ""'m"", 'baffled', 'good', 'ratings', 'movie', 'received']",Stalingrad [World War II] [English Subtitles] [2013]

More than one million people were killed. For an idea to this staggering total, and it ranks as the bloodiest battle in human history, the combined U.S. casualties in World War II were not even half that number. It was an historic victory, turning the tide of the war against Nazi Germany.The Soviet Union's entertaining 2013 film ""Stalingrad,"" one of the most successful blockbusters in the country's history, is a well-made perspective of five Russian soldiers holding a building in the bombed rubble of Stalingrad. Within the structure they discover teenage civilian Katya (Maria Smolnikova), and vow to protect her from the evils of battle. It's a poetic, if not maudlin work, as the hardened soldiers provide gifts, fall in love and present her an impromptu birthday party.Their actions are contrasted with disillusioned Nazi commander Kahn (Thomas Kretschmann, the film's only actor known to U.S. audiences). He is ordered to take the building in a series of assaults. Kahn is also obsessed with a local Russian woman Masha (Yanina Studilina), a blonde beauty ostracized by neighboring residents for ""sleeping with the enemy.""If ""Stalingrad"" is not epic in scope, there are some extraordinary battle scenes aided by IMAX 3D technology, the first Russian film to be produced in the format. An opening encounter where burning Russian soldiers charge the German lines is stunning. Perhaps implausible, it is an unforgettable symbol of the sacrifice of hundreds of thousands of soldiers in this deadliest of battles.Some of the greatest anti-war films ever made have come from Russia, with the most harrowing being the 1985 classicCome and See. Sam Peckinpah's lone foray into battle was the dark 1977 filmCross of Iron (Widescreen Special Edition), which took place on the Russian/German front. These films lack the glorified heroism seen in U.S. works, refusing to pander to audiences conditioned byTo Hell and Back,The Longest Dayand more recentlySaving Private Ryan [HD]. So it is puzzling that while ""Stalingrad"" is undoubtedly Russian, it has the feel of a gigantic James Cameron production, replete with slow motion fights, acrobatic stunts and a rousing musical score.I suppose Russian audiences deserve their heroes as much as Americans, and director Fedor Bondarchuk, along with writers Ilya Tilkin and Sergey Snezhkin, have pulled out every gimmick known to our country's summer epics. They did their homework and were rewarded handsomely as Russian audiences turned out in droves.I couldn't help but feel a peculiar sense of deja vu. There's Tom Hanks' brooding, Tom Sizemore's burly decency, Matt Damon's boyish enthusiasm and Giovanni Ribisi's geeky wisecracks. Of course, none of these actors are in the film, with Russian thespians Pyotr Fyodorov, Andrey Smolyakov, Aleksey Barabash and Dmitriy Lysenkov standing in. All of these men deliver fine performances, with Fyodorov especially displaying a sturdy presence akin to Russell Crowe or Bruce Willis.The wanton killing I accepted, as the reality was far worse than can ever be shown on screen. But I was disturbed by a slow-motion rape scene with no consequences to the perpetrator. For the women to fall in love with him afterwards was irresponsible, to say the least. And the scene where they profess their love, reminiscent of the epic works of David Lean, was uncomfortable considering the forced consummation.I've been spoiled by the dark fatality of Russian films, if not literature. The price this great army had to pay to repel the Nazi menace from their soil was unfathomable. For an idea, recall our own traumatized revulsion on Sept. 11, 2001 when terrorists attacked the World Trade Center. We lost 3,000 souls that horrible day. In World War II, the Soviet Union lost 20 million defending their land. So while their memories of this war are so much different from ours, for them to produce an Americanized version of events is almost incongruous. Perhaps they are finally ready for escapism.",4,Russia deserves their heroes...,1403308800,"06 21, 2014",2014,4229,"[""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'U.S.', 'residents', 'can', 'fully', 'understand', 'horror', 'Battle', 'Stalingrad', 'unthinkable', 'slaughter', 'Germany', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Survivors', 'Stalingrad', 'Eyewitness', 'Accounts', '6th', 'Army', '1942-1943', 'More', 'one', 'million', 'people', 'were', 'killed', 'idea', 'staggering', 'total', 'bloodiest', 'battle', 'human', 'history', 'combined', 'U.S.', 'casualties', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'were', 'not', 'even', 'number', 'was', 'historic', 'victory', 'turning', 'tide', 'war', 'Nazi', 'Germany.The', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'entertaining', '2013', 'film', 'Stalingrad', 'one', 'most', 'successful', 'blockbusters', 'country', 'history', 'well-made', 'perspective', 'five', 'Russian', 'soldiers', 'holding', 'building', 'bombed', 'rubble', 'Stalingrad', 'structure', 'discover', 'teenage', 'civilian', 'Katya', 'Maria', 'Smolnikova', 'vow', 'protect', 'evils', 'battle', 'poetic', 'not', 'maudlin', 'work', 'hardened', 'soldiers', 'provide', 'gifts', 'fall', 'love', 'present', 'impromptu', 'birthday', 'actions', 'are', 'contrasted', 'disillusioned', 'Nazi', 'commander', 'Kahn', 'Thomas', 'Kretschmann', 'film', 'only', 'actor', 'known', 'U.S.', 'audiences', 'ordered', 'take', 'building', 'series', 'assaults', 'Kahn', 'also', 'obsessed', 'local', 'Russian', 'woman', 'Masha', 'Yanina', 'Studilina', 'blonde', 'beauty', 'ostracized', 'neighboring', 'residents', 'sleeping', 'enemy', 'Stalingrad', 'not', 'epic', 'scope', 'are', 'extraordinary', 'battle', 'scenes', 'aided', 'IMAX', '3D', 'technology', 'first', 'Russian', 'film', 'be', 'produced', 'format', 'opening', 'encounter', 'where', 'burning', 'Russian', 'soldiers', 'charge', 'German', 'lines', 'stunning', 'Perhaps', 'implausible', 'unforgettable', 'symbol', 'sacrifice', 'hundreds', 'thousands', 'soldiers', 'deadliest', 'battles.Some', 'greatest', 'anti-war', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'have', 'come', 'Russia', 'most', 'harrowing', 'being', '1985', 'classicCome', 'See', 'Sam', 'Peckinpah', 'lone', 'foray', 'battle', 'was', 'dark', '1977', 'filmCross', 'Iron', 'Widescreen', 'Special', 'Edition', 'took', 'place', 'Russian/German', 'front', 'films', 'lack', 'glorified', 'heroism', 'seen', 'U.S.', 'works', 'refusing', 'pander', 'audiences', 'conditioned', 'byTo', 'Hell', 'Back', 'Longest', 'Dayand', 'more', 'recentlySaving', 'Private', 'Ryan', '[', 'HD', ']', 'puzzling', 'Stalingrad', 'undoubtedly', 'Russian', 'feel', 'gigantic', 'James', 'Cameron', 'production', 'replete', 'slow', 'motion', 'fights', 'acrobatic', 'stunts', 'rousing', 'musical', 'score.I', 'suppose', 'Russian', 'audiences', 'deserve', 'heroes', 'as', 'much', 'Americans', 'director', 'Fedor', 'Bondarchuk', 'writers', 'Ilya', 'Tilkin', 'Sergey', 'Snezhkin', 'have', 'pulled', 'out', 'gimmick', 'known', 'country', 'summer', 'epics', 'did', 'homework', 'were', 'rewarded', 'handsomely', 'Russian', 'audiences', 'turned', 'out', 'droves.I', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'peculiar', 'sense', 'deja', 'vu', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'brooding', 'Tom', 'Sizemore', 'burly', 'decency', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'boyish', 'enthusiasm', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'geeky', 'wisecracks', 'course', 'none', 'actors', 'are', 'film', 'Russian', 'thespians', 'Pyotr', 'Fyodorov', 'Andrey', 'Smolyakov', 'Aleksey', 'Barabash', 'Dmitriy', 'Lysenkov', 'standing', 'men', 'deliver', 'fine', 'performances', 'Fyodorov', 'especially', 'displaying', 'sturdy', 'presence', 'akin', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'Bruce', 'Willis.The', 'wanton', 'killing', 'accepted', 'reality', 'was', 'far', 'worse', 'can', 'ever', 'be', 'shown', 'screen', 'was', 'disturbed', 'slow-motion', 'rape', 'scene', 'consequences', 'perpetrator', 'women', 'fall', 'love', 'afterwards', 'was', 'irresponsible', 'say', 'least', 'scene', 'where', 'profess', 'love', 'reminiscent', 'epic', 'David', 'Lean', 'was', 'uncomfortable', 'considering', 'forced', 'consummation.I', ""'ve"", 'been', 'spoiled', 'dark', 'fatality', 'Russian', 'films', 'not', 'literature', 'price', 'great', 'army', 'had', 'pay', 'repel', 'Nazi', 'menace', 'soil', 'was', 'unfathomable', 'idea', 'recall', 'own', 'traumatized', 'revulsion', 'Sept.', '11', '2001', 'when', 'terrorists', 'attacked', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'lost', '3,000', 'souls', 'horrible', 'day', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'lost', '20', 'million', 'defending', 'land', 'So', 'memories', 'war', 'are', 'so', 'much', 'different', 'ours', 'produce', 'Americanized', 'version', 'events', 'almost', 'incongruous', 'Perhaps', 'are', 'finally', 'ready', 'escapism']",Stalingrad [World War II] [English Subtitles] [2013]

1689525,A395XF8C86QGAR,B00HGJB3MC,Jonathan Smith,"[0, 0]","With the scope of a big battle, it's impossible to cover all angles. War movies usually end up portraying the story of a platoon or small unit, and this one is no different. This one is not trying to be a documentary, it's human interest set in the backdrop of this big battle. While the negative reviewers do have a point, just about everything shown in this movie actually happened. The basic premise is the defense of an apartment building in a key location by a small unit, well, this happened at the famous &#34;Pavlov's House&#34;. At least one Russian made himself into a human torch to take out a tank, and there was at least one case of Russian women running a bordello servicing German customers. And over 1,000 civilians lived in and around the fighting. There were some love affairs, etc. A famous musician did come around to play for the troops, and the Germans even asked for an encore. I do have my doubts about bouncing the artillery shell around a corner, but, what the hey. Sometimes with movies we have to suspend our disbelief for dramatic purposes. This director is a little melodramatic for my taste, but this was made for the Russian film viewer, so maybe it's just right. I didn't particularly like the device for telling the story as a flashback, to a present day girl who was stuck under some rubble (I thought I had received the wrong movie on the DVD, I couldn't grasp what the Japanese could possibly have to do with Stalingrad) but this irony, and the poetic device of the guy having five fathers, does remind me of some Russian fairy tales I read as a kid. You have to please your audience, I think that's what the director was doing. As an aside, I bought the Korean movie &#34;Tae Guk Gi&#34; which is also over the top with melodrama, but one reviewer, a Korean, mentioned that this was just exactly what Korean people want and expect. So keep an open mind and go with it. With this movie, you finally get to see the Russian point of view, with Russian actors, not all Brits as in &#34;Enemy at the Gates&#34;. This one emphasizes the house-to-house fighting as opposed to the sniper duel, which was the meat and potatoes of the fighting at Stalingrad. The CGI was good, better than I expected it would be, the Stukas more realistic than in &#34;Enemy at the Gates&#34;. Most of the explosions were overdone, but that's modern film-making, along with the stop-and-start slow motion, fast motion BS I first saw in &#34;Behind Enemy Lines&#34; (others are mentioning the film &#34;300&#34; as an example, I'll have to take their word for it). The music is also overly dramatic, but better than sticking some rap percussion in there. So I think this version has its place, just watch it and enjoy it. By the way if you want a mistake, here's one: a German reminisces about the time he met Field Marshal von Paulus, well, Paulus wasn't made a field marshal until a day or two before Stalingrad's surrender, which was still two months in the future. Another anomaly, at the end, they extricate the present day girl from the rubble where she was trapped while listening to this story, well she just dusts herself off and walks out to find the man who talked to her all day, with throngs of EMS workers all around. That must be one tough broad, anywhere else she would be brought out on a stretcher, be given oxygen and IV fluids, and perhaps weakly shake his hand, instead she trots around asking for him and finally finds him in a car about to leave the scene. Whatever, just take the bad with the good, there's plenty of good here, but then I'm biased, I love the Stalingrad story.",3,"There were some love affairs, etc",1405814400,"07 20, 2014",2014,3611,"['scope', 'big', 'battle', 'impossible', 'cover', 'angles', 'War', 'movies', 'usually', 'end', 'up', 'portraying', 'story', 'platoon', 'small', 'unit', 'one', 'different', 'one', 'not', 'trying', 'be', 'documentary', 'human', 'interest', 'set', 'backdrop', 'big', 'battle', 'negative', 'reviewers', 'do', 'have', 'point', 'just', 'everything', 'shown', 'movie', 'actually', 'happened', 'basic', 'premise', 'defense', 'apartment', 'building', 'key', 'location', 'small', 'unit', 'well', 'happened', 'famous', '34', 'Pavlov', 'House', '34', 'least', 'one', 'Russian', 'made', 'human', 'torch', 'take', 'out', 'tank', 'there', 'was', 'least', 'one', 'case', 'Russian', 'women', 'running', 'bordello', 'servicing', 'German', 'customers', '1,000', 'civilians', 'lived', 'fighting', 'were', 'love', 'affairs', 'etc', 'famous', 'musician', 'did', 'come', 'play', 'troops', 'Germans', 'even', 'asked', 'encore', 'do', 'have', 'doubts', 'bouncing', 'artillery', 'shell', 'corner', 'what', 'hey', 'Sometimes', 'movies', 'have', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'dramatic', 'purposes', 'director', 'little', 'melodramatic', 'taste', 'was', 'made', 'Russian', 'film', 'viewer', 'maybe', 'just', 'right', 'did', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'device', 'telling', 'story', 'flashback', 'present', 'day', 'girl', 'who', 'was', 'stuck', 'rubble', 'thought', 'had', 'received', 'wrong', 'movie', 'DVD', 'could', ""n't"", 'grasp', 'what', 'Japanese', 'could', 'possibly', 'have', 'do', 'Stalingrad', 'irony', 'poetic', 'device', 'guy', 'having', 'five', 'fathers', 'remind', 'Russian', 'fairy', 'tales', 'read', 'kid', 'have', 'please', 'audience', 'think', 'what', 'director', 'was', 'doing', 'aside', 'bought', 'Korean', 'movie', '34', 'Tae', 'Guk', 'Gi', '34', 'also', 'top', 'melodrama', 'one', 'reviewer', 'Korean', 'mentioned', 'was', 'just', 'exactly', 'what', 'Korean', 'people', 'want', 'expect', 'So', 'keep', 'open', 'mind', 'go', 'movie', 'finally', 'get', 'see', 'Russian', 'point', 'view', 'Russian', 'actors', 'not', 'Brits', '34', 'Enemy', 'Gates', '34', 'one', 'house-to-house', 'fighting', 'opposed', 'sniper', 'duel', 'was', 'meat', 'potatoes', 'fighting', 'Stalingrad', 'CGI', 'was', 'good', 'better', 'expected', 'would', 'be', 'Stukas', 'more', 'realistic', '34', 'Enemy', 'Gates', '34', 'Most', 'explosions', 'were', 'overdone', 'modern', 'film-making', 'stop-and-start', 'slow', 'motion', 'fast', 'motion', 'BS', 'first', 'saw', '34', 'Behind', 'Enemy', 'Lines', '34', 'others', 'are', 'mentioning', 'film', '34', '300', '34', 'example', ""'ll"", 'have', 'take', 'word', 'music', 'also', 'overly', 'dramatic', 'better', 'sticking', 'rap', 'percussion', 'there', 'think', 'version', 'place', 'just', 'watch', 'enjoy', 'way', 'want', 'mistake', 'here', 'one', 'German', 'reminisces', 'time', 'met', 'Field', 'Marshal', 'von', 'Paulus', 'well', 'Paulus', 'was', ""n't"", 'made', 'field', 'marshal', 'day', 'two', 'Stalingrad', 'surrender', 'was', 'still', 'two', 'months', 'future', 'anomaly', 'end', 'extricate', 'present', 'day', 'girl', 'rubble', 'where', 'was', 'trapped', 'listening', 'story', 'well', 'just', 'off', 'walks', 'out', 'find', 'man', 'who', 'talked', 'day', 'throngs', 'EMS', 'workers', 'around', 'must', 'be', 'one', 'tough', 'broad', 'anywhere', 'else', 'would', 'be', 'brought', 'out', 'stretcher', 'be', 'given', 'oxygen', 'IV', 'fluids', 'perhaps', 'weakly', 'shake', 'hand', 'instead', 'trots', 'around', 'asking', 'finally', 'car', 'leave', 'scene', 'Whatever', 'just', 'take', 'bad', 'good', 'plenty', 'good', 'here', 'then', ""'m"", 'biased', 'love', 'Stalingrad', 'story']",Stalingrad [World War II] [English Subtitles] [2013]

Best ""Zackariah""","[1, 1]","A Woman in BerlinKatyn [Blu-ray]DresdenWell, first off, the other reviewers are correct in their analysis of the English subtitles; laughable!  I particularly enjoyed hearing the word ""Coward"" being interpreted over & over within the subtitles as ""Sissy.""  Sadly, this is one of the high points of the entertainment therein this release of ""Stalingrad.""Most folks watching this show, ...having interest in such movies; are going to be relatively familiar with the circumstances of the uniqueness of the battle of Stalingrad, and the inhabitants of the city.  Von Paulus, and the Sixth army get isolated from the Wehrmacht, and essentially freeze, or starve to death while desperately fighting valiant, terrified Soviet troops in ever increasing numbers thus heralding the coming German collapse in WWII.  Between eighty to one hundred thousand German solders are forced into horrible gulags in exotic places such as Siberia upon the surrender of the recently promoted field marshal ultimately.Forget all that!  The plotline here ain't got nothing to do with Von Paulus, Zhukov, Konev, Goebbels' propaganda, Goering's Luftwaffe, Hitler, or even Stalin.  This show is about ""love"", and social drama with the need of a reasonably studied viewer relying upon his knowledge of the harshness of WWII urban battle scenarios, and the circumstances of forced relationships between ""captured"" women, and enemy officers.  Actually, I thought the most interesting part of the movie involved the German Hauptmann & the Slavic beauty he had obviously commandeered.  The actor portraying the German captain is the same guy that I saw in another similar movie, but ain't sure which one (maybe ""The Pianist"", or ""Dresden"")  He, and the Ukrainian lady were both interesting, and obviously good veteran performers.If you have a Blu-ray version, and good surround sound, ""alien"" technology in your movie room; you will find all the latest directorial techniques currently used in similar WWII movies in evidence the last few years.  Airplane crashes, digital enhancements, constant battle/boom ambience throughout the presentation, etc. But, that's about it with this show.The whole thing starts out during the 2004 Tsunami event in Thailand(?), and then recedes into the memory of a Ukrainian rescuer toward his father's war experience in Stalingrad.  It never gets there really.  This whole show could very easily, and probably would have been better set in another Soviet city of conflict, such as Kiev, Leningrad, or Minsk.  Using the well-known city of Stalingrad as the movie's title was just probably an effort to get more attention to the show since it had been the setting of ""Enemy at the Gates.""RENT this movie, don't buy it!  ANY five minutes of the masterpiece ""Lone Survivor"" currently out there would probably please anyone interested in this kind of subject matter more than the ""Stalingrad Tales of Romance"" found in this DVD!

The Germans speak german....as do the Russians speak Russian...and the tanks, uniforms and equipment are accurate.  Also....as the Germans speak the narrator will talk also...translating in Russian....not too distracting once you figure out why your hearing two voices.

Under communist Stalin....I think not.It really captures the very different and horrid fighting that occured in Stalingrad.....the hand to hand combat in the rubble and piles of debre....the civilians caught in it.....yet spends alot of time showing how a small group of men could defend against a larger group in this environment, and how they lived and survived under these extreme conditions....the anaolgy to a current Japanese earthquake and the crumbled buildings is a refreshing way to bridge it to modern times.A must for anyone who likes war movies and/or  is a student of this battle.",5,"Great movie.

It's a dark movie picture wise though, which is not uncommon on 3d TV's as opposed to a projector.  Which is why projectors are far superior to 3d TV's. but... anyways,  this is a decent war film that is basically about men fighting in Stalingrad. Histories worst battle. It does show how people became dehumanized to a huge degree and it should be applauded for that. People on here are complaining about the not being accurate.  It is in the fact that the battle was often about one building being attacked. However this is a drama , and not all about going for a  really true f00% depiction in all details.  So it's got a lot of action and great special effects.  It is no different than the many war movies of the past where the war is the backdrop for the characters.  This is not great cinema but it's well done visually.  It's not as bad as people are saying it is.  It's just like if you watch the young lions or something , which is a drama  first and war movie second  , there is a romance here and that's not uncommon either as many civilians were there and did in fact mate with mainly with their own side though.  So if you like a old fashioned war movie , which basically gets some of it right and gives you five characters to get to know ,  8 actually counting a german officer.

While the special effects were much superior to the 1993 German production of the same title, the earlier film is much better , with a much more compelling story, and lacking the silly romantic side story of this version.Ironically, the seemingly ubiquitous Thomas Kretschmann was also in the 1993 version, yet, after 20 years, he's still only a hauptmann!  I thought promotion was quicker in wartime?A Russian production, the movie concentrates primarily on a Russian reconnaisance team facing long odds in the defense of a buliding blocking the German's route to the Volga, and possible final victory in this horrific battle.The Russian's are given some fleshing out of their characters, but are still somewhat stereotypical types, but not as bad as the Germans, save, perhaps Kretschmann's somewhat conflicted portrayal. His CO, a far too long in the tooth oberstleutnant, is a caricature of the German officer we have seen in so many movies. The killing of Russian civilians, graphically portrayed, was really unecessary, and all too stereotypical.The scene where the Russians attack through burning gasoline is compelling, but the final German assault, with tanks lined up together like an old cavalry charge, is militarily and historically absurd.To sum up, it's a film worth watching for anyone with a casual interest in this battle,as long as high expectations are not present.",3,OK for a Redbox rental,1400457600,"05 19, 2014",2014,1486,"['Well', '1.28', 'suppose', 'ca', ""n't"", 'complain', 'much', 'was', 'rather', 'disappointed', 'film', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'much', 'superior', '1993', 'German', 'production', 'same', 'title', 'earlier', 'film', 'much', 'better', 'much', 'more', 'compelling', 'story', 'lacking', 'silly', 'romantic', 'side', 'story', 'version.Ironically', 'seemingly', 'ubiquitous', 'Thomas', 'Kretschmann', 'was', 'also', '1993', 'version', 'yet', '20', 'years', 'still', 'only', 'hauptmann', 'thought', 'promotion', 'was', 'quicker', 'wartime', 'Russian', 'production', 'movie', 'primarily', 'Russian', 'reconnaisance', 'team', 'facing', 'long', 'odds', 'defense', 'buliding', 'blocking', 'German', 'route', 'Volga', 'possible', 'final', 'victory', 'horrific', 'Russian', 'are', 'given', 'fleshing', 'characters', 'are', 'still', 'somewhat', 'stereotypical', 'types', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'Germans', 'save', 'perhaps', 'Kretschmann', 'somewhat', 'conflicted', 'portrayal', 'CO', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'tooth', 'oberstleutnant', 'caricature', 'German', 'officer', 'have', 'seen', 'so', 'many', 'movies', 'killing', 'Russian', 'civilians', 'graphically', 'portrayed', 'was', 'really', 'unecessary', 'too', 'stereotypical.The', 'scene', 'where', 'Russians', 'attack', 'burning', 'gasoline', 'compelling', 'final', 'German', 'assault', 'tanks', 'lined', 'up', 'together', 'old', 'cavalry', 'charge', 'militarily', 'historically', 'absurd.To', 'sum', 'up', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'anyone', 'casual', 'interest', 'battle', 'as', 'long', 'as', 'high', 'expectations', 'are', 'not', 'present']",Stalingrad [World War II] [English Subtitles] [2013]

But, even with having English dubbing when the Russians speak, it is when the Germans speak, that is still heard in German. So, you will end up having to watch the movie with the English sub-titles on the screen anyway, when most of the time, you will just wish they weren't there. There is alot of English dubbing throughout the film, so that's why it is kinda disappointing to have to have the English subtitles on too, just to get through the German parts.If they just couldn't change the German dubbing to English, it would have been a better experience watching it if had the English subtitles appear ONLY when the Germans speak, and not have them appear while we are hearing English.  The movie ""Tai Chi Zero"" has this same disappointment about having to watch English sub-titles all the way through it, when all I really wanted was to have English sub-titles when the written Chinese print appeared on the screen.Anyway, this was the first time that I bought a Blu-ray that gave you the 3D version as a second disc instead of a DVD. I prefer it that way because I don't need the inferior DVD or any more DVD's in my collection. I don't have a 3D player yet, but someday I will.Anyway, about the story itself, it just drags sometimes with it's mellow-drama, then eventually you'll get some really cool fighting scenes. So, perhaps this film may just be a better 3D experience, then to really care to follow any story. The same can be said about the new film ""Pompeii"" that my wife and I saw in 3D at the theatre.  It all looked pretty cool, but the film itself was a rather dull story.For a Nazi film, this movie would work in great to watch within a good Nazi triple feature.

Long periods of nothing but your own worries, doubts, and fears, interrupted by frighteningly fast, hair-raising action that means life-and-death.  Then... back to tedium, monotony, and even boredom.  One of the strengths of &#34;Stalingrad&#34; is that it accurately portrays the lulls, the savage, horrific action, AND -- the effects of both of these things on the minds of the people in these two &#34;Band of Brothers&#34; groups -- Russian, and German.Because it was &#34;Stalingrad&#34; from a Russian point of view, I think I expected it to be almost too slanted and biased to watch, but I was wrong.  Yes, the full horrors of war are quite evident, but both sides in this greatest conflict of WWII are, I believe, fairly accurately portrayed.  Director Fedor Bondarchuk produced a really fine movie, lovingly put-together without slavish reliance on CG effect on a computer, and I hope you enjoy it -- especially if you speak Russian and German.",4,"A very impressive, well-constructed story of two ""Bands of Brothers"" in the biggest battle of WWII",1404000000,"06 29, 2014",2014,1978,"['spoilers', 'sets', 'magnificently-detailed', 'sets', 'meticulously-constructed', 'buildings', 'backdrops', 'horrific', 'action', 'sequences', 'made', 'truly', 'stunning', 'experience', 'wo', ""n't"", 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'fully', 'appreciated', 'lot', 'viewers', 'Why', 'Really', 'need', 'be', 'able', 'understand', 'Russian', 'German', 'appreciate', '34', 'blood', '34', 'well-made', '34', 'body', '34', 'movie', 'English-spoken', 'version', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'so', '34', '21st-Century', '34', 'delivery', 'cadence', 'intonation', 'could', ""n't"", 'stand', 'more', 'about', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'am', 'conversant', 'German', 'so', 'least', 'could', 'appreciate', 'portion', 'dialogue', 'opinion', 'German-speaking', 'actors', 'were', 'very', 'good', ""'ll"", 'take', '34', 'faith', '34', 'Russian-speaking', 'actors', 'were', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'indeed', 'seemed', 'be.Some', 'complain', 'pace', 'movie', 'was', 'uneven', 'quite', 'slow', 'times', 'Ever', 'been', 'war', 'exactly', 'what', 'real', 'war', 'IS', 'Long', 'periods', 'nothing', 'own', 'worries', 'doubts', 'fears', 'interrupted', 'frighteningly', 'fast', 'hair-raising', 'action', 'life-and-death', 'Then', 'back', 'tedium', 'monotony', 'even', 'boredom', 'One', 'strengths', '34', 'Stalingrad', '34', 'accurately', 'lulls', 'savage', 'horrific', 'action', 'effects', 'things', 'minds', 'people', 'two', '34', 'Band', 'Brothers', '34', 'groups', 'Russian', 'German.Because', 'was', '34', 'Stalingrad', '34', 'Russian', 'point', 'view', 'think', 'expected', 'be', 'almost', 'too', 'slanted', 'biased', 'watch', 'was', 'wrong', 'Yes', 'full', 'horrors', 'war', 'are', 'quite', 'evident', 'sides', 'greatest', 'conflict', 'WWII', 'are', 'believe', 'fairly', 'accurately', 'portrayed', 'Director', 'Fedor', 'Bondarchuk', 'produced', 'really', 'fine', 'movie', 'lovingly', 'put-together', 'slavish', 'reliance', 'CG', 'effect', 'computer', 'hope', 'enjoy', 'especially', 'speak', 'Russian', 'German']",Stalingrad [World War II] [English Subtitles] [2013]

Problem is the version I saw was dubbed into American. I know there have been issues with the huge sub titles that did not necessarily match the dialogue, but I would always prefer to watch in the original language - which I have now found out was an option but I could not sit through this again. The Germans all speak German so that bit was alright.Anyway the movie tells the story of a band of Russian soldiers and navy who have to defend a strategically important house in the centre of Stalingrad to protect the Volga crossing. [If only the Germans had brought some planes they could have flown over!] Still never mind, and in this house is Katya who they are all smitten with. They are up against a German of ambiguous disposition, Kahn, who could be a good German or a crazed rapist and xenophobe, the debate is a bit wide open.We have a number of battles and fighting scenes, which are mostly done in slow motion and with some bizarre camera angles, which are there I suspect, as this was also shot in 3 D so has to have the pizzazz factor for the pop corn addicts. It has very little to do with the actual battle of Stalingrad and the story line could be placed in a fair number of other locations. The action was done very well and the CGI money was generally well spent. The acting is hard to gauge because of the awful dubbing.There is a lot of pointless dialogue too that seems to act as padding. The soldiers being afire and attacking the Germans at the beginning was a bit of a stretch and set my mind against the film from that point. There was a lot of cash spent on this and yet the overall accomplishment is somewhat flat. It comes across as a bit propaganda filled too but is so unconvincing that it doesn't matter. The German film from 1993 also called `Stalingrad' is a much better watch. Directed by film royalty Fedor Bondarchuk who is a superb actor and he clearly has talent but this film has too many issues to be called `good' so only really watch if you must see all war films. Recent Russian films such as `Fortress of War', `Admiral', `The Star' etc are all much better than what we have here.",3,Russian CGI-fest about some house called `Stalingrad',1405123200,"07 12, 2014",2014,2206,"['Russia', 'entry', '2014', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'best', 'Foreign', 'language', 'film', 'Problem', 'version', 'saw', 'was', 'dubbed', 'American', 'know', 'there', 'have', 'been', 'issues', 'huge', 'sub', 'titles', 'did', 'not', 'necessarily', 'match', 'dialogue', 'would', 'always', 'prefer', 'watch', 'original', 'language', 'have', 'now', 'found', 'out', 'was', 'option', 'could', 'not', 'sit', 'again', 'Germans', 'speak', 'German', 'bit', 'was', 'alright.Anyway', 'movie', 'story', 'band', 'Russian', 'soldiers', 'navy', 'who', 'have', 'defend', 'strategically', 'important', 'house', 'centre', 'Stalingrad', 'protect', 'Volga', 'crossing', '[', 'only', 'Germans', 'had', 'brought', 'planes', 'could', 'have', 'flown', 'over', ']', 'Still', 'never', 'mind', 'house', 'Katya', 'who', 'are', 'smitten', 'are', 'up', 'German', 'ambiguous', 'disposition', 'Kahn', 'who', 'could', 'be', 'good', 'German', 'crazed', 'rapist', 'xenophobe', 'debate', 'bit', 'wide', 'open.We', 'have', 'number', 'battles', 'fighting', 'scenes', 'are', 'mostly', 'done', 'slow', 'motion', 'bizarre', 'camera', 'angles', 'are', 'suspect', 'was', 'also', 'shot', '3', 'D', 'so', 'have', 'pizzazz', 'factor', 'pop', 'corn', 'addicts', 'very', 'little', 'do', 'actual', 'battle', 'Stalingrad', 'story', 'line', 'could', 'be', 'placed', 'fair', 'number', 'other', 'locations', 'action', 'was', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'CGI', 'money', 'was', 'generally', 'well', 'spent', 'acting', 'hard', 'gauge', 'awful', 'lot', 'pointless', 'dialogue', 'too', 'that', 'act', 'padding', 'soldiers', 'being', 'afire', 'attacking', 'Germans', 'beginning', 'was', 'bit', 'stretch', 'set', 'mind', 'film', 'point', 'was', 'lot', 'cash', 'spent', 'yet', 'overall', 'accomplishment', 'somewhat', 'flat', 'bit', 'propaganda', 'filled', 'too', 'so', 'unconvincing', ""n't"", 'matter', 'German', 'film', '1993', 'also', 'called', 'Stalingrad', 'much', 'better', 'watch', 'Directed', 'film', 'royalty', 'Fedor', 'Bondarchuk', 'who', 'superb', 'actor', 'clearly', 'talent', 'film', 'too', 'many', 'issues', 'be', 'called', 'good', 'so', 'only', 'really', 'watch', 'must', 'see', 'war', 'films', 'Recent', 'Russian', 'films', 'such', 'Fortress', 'War', 'Admiral', 'Star', 'etc', 'are', 'all', 'much', 'better', 'what', 'have', 'here']",Stalingrad [World War II] [English Subtitles] [2013]

In order to stop the German advance the Russian army must fight back and hold the city or the country could fall. When a group of soldiers sent to protect a building find two women living there they find another reason to fight. Lately the war movie genre has been a lot like the western genre. There are a lot being made and about 10% are good. While I would put this one in the good category there are still some flaws in this. It was a bigger budget movie then most and the war sequences were actually very good, even though the 300 type effects were overused. The main downfall with this movie is when there was no action the movie really slowed down and I started to lose interest a few times. Other then that though this was good and in terms of recent war movies this is one of the better ones. Overall, a good movie but would have been better if it was shorter and the love story aspects were sped up a little.

The German film Stalingrad, while uneven, has some excellent scenes, especially in the factory and in the tank battle; Enemy at the Gates starts well though it deteriorates somewhat. High quality books on the subject include War of the Rats by David Roberts; a German corporal muses as he passes the Tractor Factory &#34;it's ours, we bought it, and it'll never be worth what we paid for it&#34; and of course the stellar book Enemy at the Gates. Alas, this movie comes across as made by amateurs; is the director related to the maker of War and Peace and Waterloo? If so he must be senile. The story is labored, there really aren't any large scale action scenes, the drama is corny and predictable.
