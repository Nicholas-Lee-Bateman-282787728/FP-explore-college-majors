Teslovich,"[0, 1]","Two disks: ""Arthur and the Revenge of Maltazard""; Arthur 3: The War of the Two WorldsComparing this two part fantasy movie with a comparable story, ""The Secret World of Arrietty"", from the famous Studio Ghibli (and I am a Miyazaki fan), is like comparing the visuals in ""Rango"" to a '70s comic book. The French studios of BUF and EuropaCorp have surpassed the Japanese and maybe all but one or two of the American studios in producing detailed, lifelike animation that treats each character and even non-essential elements with individualization. They have not fallen into the economical rut of using the same, nonmoving, 2D background over and over again that is usually found in more cheaply produced animations.Great crossover voices such as Snoop Dogg, Fergie, Will. I. Am, Selena; intelligent dialogue (with touches of humor and wit) and fantasy storytelling. Great CGI, sets, modeling, bluescreen and motion control.
