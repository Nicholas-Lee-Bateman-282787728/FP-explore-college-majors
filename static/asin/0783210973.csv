The only good thing about this movie is the spectacular African scenery and better than average cinematography.  I was so disappointed to see Sean  Connery (my favorite actor of all) wasting his talents on this unwatchable  film -- or, I should say, the script he's been given is an affront to his  talent.  Try MEDICINE MAN, instead.  It has the same great scenery, and a  much more enjoyable Sean Connery.",1,A WASTE OF GREAT TALENT,955929600,"04 17, 2000",2000,477,"['plot', 'apart', 'everywhere', 'dialogue', 'run-down', 'babbling', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'movie', 'spectacular', 'African', 'scenery', 'better', 'average', 'cinematography', 'was', 'so', 'disappointed', 'see', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'favorite', 'actor', 'wasting', 'talents', 'unwatchable', 'film', 'should', 'say', 'script', 'been', 'given', 'affront', 'talent', 'Try', 'MEDICINE', 'MAN', 'instead', 'same', 'great', 'scenery', 'much', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'Sean', 'Connery']",Good Man in Africa VHS

44822,A3R8UUOKL55GCR,0783210973,Dennis M. Hannon,"[1, 2]","This movie is without blood and without the satirical bite that I had hoped for. A number of good ideas are introduced, but none developed, most salient of which is the character portrayed by Sean Connery. There is way, way too little of him in this movie and way, way too much of John Lithgow's ultra-lame British Accent. The protagonist is a dud too. I was hoping for something on the order of Evelyn Waugh, or at least White Mischief. Instead I got something about as adroit as a Meryl Streep stand-up. This movie just sort of lays there for a while (too long a while) and then just dies.",2,Anemic in Africa,1389830400,"01 16, 2014",2014,591,"['movie', 'blood', 'satirical', 'bite', 'had', 'hoped', 'number', 'good', 'ideas', 'are', 'introduced', 'none', 'developed', 'most', 'salient', 'character', 'portrayed', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'way', 'way', 'too', 'little', 'movie', 'way', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'ultra-lame', 'British', 'Accent', 'protagonist', 'dud', 'too', 'was', 'hoping', 'something', 'order', 'Evelyn', 'Waugh', 'least', 'White', 'Mischief', 'Instead', 'got', 'something', 'as', 'adroit', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'stand-up', 'movie', 'just', 'sort', 'lays', 'while', 'too', 'long', 'while', 'then', 'just', 'dies']",Good Man in Africa VHS
