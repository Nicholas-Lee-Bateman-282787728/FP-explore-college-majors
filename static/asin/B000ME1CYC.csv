I'm guessing it is set in the 1970s but I could be wrong. All the cars and businesses on the strip that appear in the movie appear to be the actual city and actual cars and not a studio set or replica vehicles. It is a very good drama/action movie. It delves deep into the Mexican American culture that exists in lower California. Highly recommended.
