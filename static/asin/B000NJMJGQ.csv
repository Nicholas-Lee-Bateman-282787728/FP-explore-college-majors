However, I've decided to re-post a review.  This show started as a light detective series about a put-upon detective who was the last detective his boss would assign to an important case.  The show has progressed nicely, though, to the point where, in season 3, Dangerous Davies, the Last Detective, is now the backbone of his department.  His antagonistic co-workers and goofy buddy Mod have slid to the side, his boss is facing personal demons, and his wife is beginning, perhaps?, to see the strength in Peter Davison's character.  No longer really a laughingstock, Dangerous in this season shows himself a capable detective and a strong character upon whom others may rely.  Good shows keep getting better in their early years, and the Last Detective is such a show.  It is a gratifying tonic to the increased violence and explicit nature of cop and detective shows now appearing in both the USA and Britain.  Great stuff, and on my short list of favorites, along with Rumpole, Due South (seasons 1 & 2), Dead Like Me, Wonderfalls, Briscoe County, and Yes (Prime) Minister.

1057320,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B000NJMJGQ,C. O. DeRiemer,"[19, 30]","Series 3 of The Last Detective, if nothing else, establishes that the writers have placed themselves in a box.The last detective is Detective Constable Davies --""Dangerous"" Davies to his coworkers. He's the least likely cop to find himself in a dangerous situation, or so they think. His boss has said that Davies is the last detective he'd ever assign to an important case. Davies (Peter Davison) may be a bit of a plodder, may be too nice for his own good, but he's also thorough, conscientious and firmly committed to find the bad guys wherever the search takes him.It's an interesting concept that worked fairly well in the first series. There, we were getting to know Davies and the men he worked with. The problem is that as The Last Detective has continued, the writers have given us absolutely no regular cast characters, except Davies, who are the least bit likable. Davies' two fellow detectives are smirking, condescending clots who not only treat Davies with disdain but everyone else as well. His chief is a closet drunk who treats everyone abruptly. His wife, from whom he is separated but still loves, is a sullen, petulant woman who plays Davies like a yo-yo. Even his best friend, Mod, while a nice guy, is not someone to depend on. The unrelieved tiresomeness of all these people are used by the writers simply as a device to show how decent, forbearing and genuine Davies is. It would never work except for Peter Davison who plays Davies.Davison gives Davies immense likeability and sympathy. He made his acting name as Tristan Farnon in All Creatures Great and Small nearly thirty years ago. He has gone on to play all sorts of characters, from the well-bred gentleman detective Albert Campion to the good doctor himself in Dr. Who. Davison is one of these people you like as soon as you see him.The mysteries in Series Three are adequate. The writers give us stories, unfortunately, that are heavier with angst and agony than they are with nasty motives and clever murders. When one throws in all the heavy acting with all the tiresome regulars, the only thing we have left is Peter Davison's ability to carry the show. He does it, but it gets harder each season.There are four programs, each one about 70 minutes long.

Davis is a throwback to the pre 1960's when police worked using their brains and their 'local knowledge' which was built by experience. They worked successfully, without the assistance of abundant technical equipment and scientific devices. Davis is the quintessential policeman we admired and respected.

1057341,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B000NJMJGQ,Stephanie De Pue,"[0, 0]","""The Last Detective, Series 3,""another in the hit British mystery television series, is now becoming available in the United States for the first time.  The police procedural/comedy/drama was made by Granada for the United Kingdom's Independent Television (ITV).  It debuted in the U.K. in February 2003, and offers a lighter-hearted, but still high-quality, blend of mystery and comedy similar  to that ofMidsomer Murders: Set 13; andHetty Wainthropp Investigates - Complete Collection. It's based on the ""Dangerous Davies"" novels of the Welshman Leslie Thomas.  This release consists of a two-volume boxed set including four all-new full-length productions.  Unfortunately, it does not come with subtitles, so the viewer is in for rather a struggle with the North London accents the actors have been encouraged to use, logically enough, as it is set in North London.  Nevertheless, I consider it a lucky find.It's set in Willesden, a totally unimportant, small, totally out of the way North London precinct, and appears to have been filmed there.  It stars Peter Davison (All Creatures Great & Small: The Complete Series 1 Collection;Campion - The Complete First Season) as Detective Constable - and it's quite a disgrace to be only a detective constable--""Dangerous"" Davies.  His chances of promotion are nil; he's the eponymous last detective his supervisor would ever willingly assign to a case, and he gets the least promising ones.  But he does generally get his man, or, possibly, woman.  He's an average Joe looks-wise, and a rumpled, galumphing, unassuming sort.  But he does love his job, and he's surprisingly good at it.  He also loves his sexy, beautiful blond wife, Julie (Emma Amos), but, in this particular series, they are separated.  And he's rooming with his wild and crazy friend Mod (Sean Hughes,The Commitments).  Hughes brings a lot to his part, but so do the other leads, and, in fact, the series is consistently well-acted and directed.  The mysteries are reasonably complex and satisfying, too.  They are:1. ""Friends Reunited."" Wealthy mobile phone magnate Nick Roberts is stabbed to death at his college reunion; all evidence seems to point to Simon Dabney, Nick's best friend in school days, now a broken - and broke--bitter drug addict.  But Davies insists on believing Dabney's absurd alibi.  This episode allows its makers to visit London's underworld, indulging in what strikes me as faux nostalgia.  I wasn't there at the time or place, but I rather doubt the underworld was peopled by such gentlemen.  It certainly hasn't been since the heyday of the Kray brothers, in the late 1950's, 1960s: they were terrifyingly violent psychotics.  And they've been followed by Jamaican posses, Chinese tongs, and Russian maffias, whom you'd really rather not cross.  Still, the episode is emotionally satisfying.2. ""Towpaths of Glory."" Decorated war veteran Frank Moore is found murdered and dumped in a local rubbish heap.  Upon investigation, Davies finds that his domestic life was less than blissful; and that his former army comrades may know more than they're saying.  Another emotionally satisfying experience.3. ""Three Steps to Hendon."" The Overnight Sensations supposedly topped the pop charts back in the 1970's with their smash single, ""Yesterday's Boy.""  But time has rolled on, and their former lead singer Teddy O'Connor, has been feeling a lot like ""Yesterday's Boy,"" himself.  Then he turns up murdered.  In his investigation, Davies discovers there's a dark underside to glam rock - what a surprise.  The frequently seen Ian McNeice (Murder Rooms - The Dark Beginnings of Sherlock Holmes) guest stars here, and turns in a gratifyingly strong performance.4. ""Willesden Confidential.""  Champion stockcar driver Geoff ""The Duke"" Fallon appears to have been killed in a fiery racetrack fire after an accident.  But Davies has a feeling it's murder, and arrests a young hoodlum, apparently bent on revenge, for sabotaging Fallon's car.  But Davies has a further feeling, and keeps looking.These shows are really well-done, and deserve to be seen on broadcast TV over here.
