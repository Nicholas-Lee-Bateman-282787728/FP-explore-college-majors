1460856,AETEH7SOTOFRT,B005GYZR3U,KittyScratchesBooks,"[0, 0]","The FBI belongs in the collection of those who grew up watching this. The remaining seasons become refined and very interesting. The first season is very sanitised and there is nothing wrong with that; however, as the series progress, you will find that it was worth the wait. Take the time to also wait for the prices to be reduced.This series WAS released from 1965 to 1974 and Warner Brothers can be a bit expensive KNOWING that there are so many of us who enjoy quality programming. It is dated, but as the series mature, THAT will not matter. Most of the series are based on actual case files and dramatised for the audience. Efrem Zimbalist Jr. never disappoints, Phillip Abbot gives you the atmosphere of the seriousness of The FBI organisation. It gave young audiences a desire to become G-Men.This is when series were actually series where each package is generous in the amount of series provided.  I would suggest purchasing each series (they come in series 1&2 as there are many per season).SO you will have to purchase 2 sets per season. Plenty of programming and place each in your wish list to treat yourself every month. I like the relationship that he has with his daughter.A very fine Quinn Martin Series. Warner Brothers does not disappoint. Worth the investment , but just wait for the prices to lower, I may sell my first season for 1/2 the price and purchase the remaining seasons next month. If any one is interested, let me know. They will only be watched once by our family and we take care of our collection.  We are reasonable since we have opened our brand new packaged and will only watch them once. Let us know. We are reasonable and fair.",3,Season one is really just okay ...but the quality of performances is really very good!!,1389139200,"01 8, 2014",2014,1669,"['FBI', 'belongs', 'collection', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'remaining', 'seasons', 'become', 'refined', 'very', 'interesting', 'first', 'season', 'very', 'sanitised', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'however', 'series', 'progress', 'will', 'find', 'was', 'worth', 'wait', 'Take', 'time', 'also', 'wait', 'prices', 'be', 'reduced.This', 'series', 'WAS', 'released', '1965', '1974', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'expensive', 'KNOWING', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'who', 'enjoy', 'quality', 'programming', 'dated', 'series', 'mature', 'THAT', 'will', 'not', 'matter', 'Most', 'series', 'are', 'based', 'actual', 'case', 'files', 'dramatised', 'audience', 'Efrem', 'Zimbalist', 'Jr.', 'never', 'disappoints', 'Phillip', 'Abbot', 'atmosphere', 'seriousness', 'FBI', 'organisation', 'gave', 'young', 'audiences', 'desire', 'become', 'G-Men.This', 'when', 'series', 'were', 'actually', 'series', 'where', 'package', 'generous', 'amount', 'series', 'provided', 'would', 'suggest', 'purchasing', 'series', 'come', 'series', '1', '2', 'are', 'many', 'season', '.SO', 'will', 'have', 'purchase', '2', 'sets', 'season', 'Plenty', 'programming', 'place', 'wish', 'list', 'treat', 'month', 'relationship', 'daughter.A', 'very', 'fine', 'Quinn', 'Martin', 'Series', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'not', 'disappoint', 'investment', 'just', 'wait', 'prices', 'lower', 'may', 'sell', 'first', 'season', '1/2', 'price', 'purchase', 'remaining', 'seasons', 'next', 'month', 'one', 'interested', 'let', 'know', 'will', 'only', 'be', 'watched', 'once', 'family', 'take', 'care', 'collection', 'are', 'reasonable', 'have', 'opened', 'brand', 'new', 'packaged', 'will', 'only', 'watch', 'once', 'Let', 'know', 'are', 'reasonable', 'fair']","The FBI: Season 1, Part 2"

1460860,A2HKNKRC4TMQJ7,B005GYZR3U,NYPD Blue Afficionado,"[17, 22]","Many of the reviews for this product concern the price. It seems all the Quinn Martin shows on DVD are sold in two parts, and The FBI seems to have a higher retail for both volumes. We need CBS/Paramount to realize that there is a huge market for quality television, and since most of today's shows don't qualify, we look to the past. Most shows on DVD range between 30 to 50 dollars for complete seasons. Give us complete seasons, save on packaging and pass the savings along to the consumer. That being said, I was big fan of this show, and to me, the price is worth it. But I fear many do not feel as I do and therefore will not purchase the series and discourage the studio from issuing more seasons.If Season 1, Part 1 is any indication, the quality will be excellent on Part 2. The usual character actors of the day such as Earl Holliman, Barbara Luna, Jessica Walter, Harold Gould, etc, were guest stars.
