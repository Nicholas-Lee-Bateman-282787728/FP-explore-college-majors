526487,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00003CXIJ,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[1, 6]","From what I remember seeing of this film, it was not good. I always say that if a film is good and can keep you attention throughout the hardest of moments (example: a Tylenol Cold & Sinus war) than it is a film that has done its job. The fact that I was asleep for most of this film only proves the fact that it could not keep my attention, and ergo, it did not complete its job. Why did I fall victim to the Tylenol Cold & Sinus, when I had a film in my arsenal?To begin, Committed did not make any sense. The acting was poor and the overall story left more doors opened that just couldn't be closed. I am thinking of the moment when I swear I saw Affleck and Graham (brother and sister in this film) kissing. That didn't make any sense. Then there was a scene with Affleck and his roommates indicating that he was sleeping with one of them, almost breaking up a perfect lesbian couple. I suppose this was to show that most are not as committed to a relationship as Graham is, but for me it just was nothing more than filler. I have this suspicious feeling that the director of this film was sleeping with Affleck. His acting in this film was atrocious. I mean, I have never seen him do any ""good"" acting, but this was by far the worst. Oh, what was John Stewart doing in this film? That was yet again another moment when my eyes were opened just for a moment in one of those battles that seemed to last forever.And frankly, it's Heather Graham - we could care less about her after a while. She's just not interesting - she's just bland, boring and basically stops acting after a while. While they desperately start throwing wacky characters into the mix to revive the movie, it just doesn't work and instead of just calling it a day - they start throwing more characters into the mix so now it's just weird, tedious, boring and really, really long. Luke Wilson's slow drawl acting style slows an already crawling movie to dead halt - why exactly were these two married?Committed is a truly terrible film--the kind of ""hip comedy"" that leaves you staggering out depressed and bored.Grade: * out of *****",1,I need to be committed ...,1123632000,"08 10, 2005",2005,2105,"['what', 'remember', 'seeing', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'good', 'always', 'say', 'film', 'good', 'can', 'keep', 'attention', 'hardest', 'moments', 'example', 'Tylenol', 'Cold', 'Sinus', 'war', 'film', 'done', 'job', 'fact', 'was', 'asleep', 'most', 'film', 'only', 'fact', 'could', 'not', 'keep', 'attention', 'ergo', 'did', 'not', 'complete', 'job', 'Why', 'did', 'fall', 'victim', 'Tylenol', 'Cold', 'Sinus', 'when', 'had', 'film', 'arsenal', 'begin', 'Committed', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'sense', 'acting', 'was', 'poor', 'overall', 'story', 'left', 'more', 'doors', 'opened', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'closed', 'am', 'thinking', 'moment', 'when', 'swear', 'saw', 'Affleck', 'Graham', 'brother', 'sister', 'film', 'kissing', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'Then', 'was', 'scene', 'Affleck', 'roommates', 'indicating', 'was', 'sleeping', 'one', 'almost', 'breaking', 'up', 'perfect', 'lesbian', 'couple', 'suppose', 'was', 'show', 'most', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'committed', 'relationship', 'Graham', 'just', 'was', 'nothing', 'more', 'filler', 'have', 'suspicious', 'feeling', 'director', 'film', 'was', 'sleeping', 'Affleck', 'acting', 'film', 'was', 'atrocious', 'mean', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'do', 'good', 'acting', 'was', 'far', 'worst', 'Oh', 'what', 'was', 'John', 'Stewart', 'doing', 'film', 'was', 'yet', 'again', 'moment', 'when', 'eyes', 'were', 'opened', 'just', 'moment', 'one', 'battles', 'seemed', 'last', 'forever.And', 'frankly', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'while', 'just', 'not', 'interesting', 'just', 'bland', 'boring', 'basically', 'stops', 'acting', 'while', 'desperately', 'start', 'throwing', 'wacky', 'characters', 'mix', 'revive', 'movie', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'instead', 'just', 'calling', 'day', 'start', 'throwing', 'more', 'characters', 'mix', 'so', 'now', 'just', 'weird', 'tedious', 'boring', 'really', 'really', 'long', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'slow', 'drawl', 'acting', 'style', 'already', 'crawling', 'movie', 'dead', 'halt', 'why', 'exactly', 'were', 'two', 'married', 'Committed', 'truly', 'terrible', 'film', 'kind', 'hip', 'comedy', 'staggering', 'out', 'depressed', 'bored.Grade', '*', '*****']",N/A

Those who say so here must have never seen ANY other movies of any quality at all. It's a typical Heather Graham film--dumb, made for the brainless, and not made by professionals.  Somebody wants her face in it, but forgets to have a plot or even a high-school-level script.  I'm not exaggerating one bit, I wish I was, for I wasted money on this childish, dumb, trash.Ok, the blu-ray picture quality was excellent.However, this film is garbage.  The writer and director must have been on drugs when they came up with this.  It starts with a small event, then . . . skips to Texas . . . where nothing interesting happens, no life lessons are learned, just 90 minutes in a boring person's life spread over a few days.What in heck was the plot?  It was NOT what the package said.Why did her brother, played by Casey Affleck, kiss Heather on the LIPS??  What was the foundation for that, or the later explanation?  Sorry, folks, there was NONE of either.  It was just a weird thing that happened out of nowhere, not developed, not explained, and related to nothing.Which describes this worthless movie, if one can call it that.

526499,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00003CXIJ,Reviewer,"[11, 14]","Some people drift through life, moving from one thing or one person to the next without batting an eye; others latch on to a cause, another person or a principle and remain adamant, committed to whatever it is-- and figuratively or literally they give their word and stand by it.  But we&#65533;re all different, &#65533;Made of different clay,&#65533; as one of the characters in this film puts it, which is what makes life so interesting.  Some people are just plain crazy, though-- and maybe that&#65533;s the way you have to be to live among the masses.  Who knows?  Who knows what it takes to make things-- life-- work?  Writer/director Lisa Krueger takes a shot at it, using a light approach to examine that thin line between being committed-- and how one &#65533;gets&#65533; committed-- and obsession, in &#65533;Committed,&#65533; starring Heather Graham as a young woman who is adamant, committed, obsessive and maybe just a little bit crazy, too.  Her name is Joline, and this is her story.Admittedly, Joline has always been a committed person; in work, relationships, in life in general.  She&#65533;s a woman of her word who sticks by it no matter what.  And when she marries Carl (Luke Wilson), it&#65533;s forever.  The only problem is, someone forgot to tell Carl-- and 597 days into the marriage, he&#65533;s gone; off to &#65533;find&#65533; himself and figure it all out.  When Joline realizes he&#65533;s not coming back, she refuses to give up on him, or their marriage.  Maybe it&#65533;s because of that &#65533;clay&#65533; she&#65533;s made of.  Regardless, she leaves their home in New York City and sets off to find him, which she does-- in El Paso, Texas, of all places.  But once she knows where he is, she keeps her distance, giving him his &#65533;space&#65533; and not even letting him know she&#65533;s there.  She considers Carl as being in a &#65533;spiritual coma,&#65533; and it&#65533;s her job to keep a &#65533;spiritual vigil&#65533; over him until he comes to his senses.  And while she watches and waits, her life is anything but dull, as she encounters a young woman named Carmen (Patricia Velazquez), a waitress at one of the local eateries; Carmen&#65533;s &#65533;Grampy,&#65533; (Alfonso Arau), who is something of a mystic; T-Bo (Mark Ruffalo), a truck driver who has issues concerning Carl; and Neil (Goran Visnjic) an artist who makes pinatas and takes a fancy to her.  For Joline, it&#65533;s a journey of discovery, during which she learns a lot about Carl, but even more about herself.There&#65533;s a touch of humor, a touch of romance, and some insights into human nature in this quirky film that is more about characterization and character than plot.  And Krueger presents it all extremely well, delivering a film that is engaging and entertaining.  Her characters are very real people, with all the wants, needs and imperfections that make up the human condition; a rich and eclectic bunch through which she tells her story.  We see it from Joline&#65533;s point-of-view, as Krueger makes us privy to Joline&#65533;s thoughts and therefore her motivations, which puts a decided perspective on the events as they unfold.  That, along with the deliberate pace she sets that allows you to soak up the atmosphere and the ambiance she creates, makes for a very effective piece of storytelling.  There&#65533;s an underlying seriousness to this subject matter, but Krueger chooses to avoid anything heavy-handed or too deep and concentrates instead on the natural humor that evolves from the people and situations that Joline encounters.  And the result is a well textured, affecting and upbeat look at that thing we call life.Heather Graham takes hold of this role from the first frame of the film to make Joline a character totally of her own creation.  She immerses herself in the part and gives a performance that is convincing and believable, adding the little personal traits and nuance that makes all the difference between a portrayal that is a mere representation of a person, and one that is real.  And for this film to work, it was imperative that Joline be viable and believable-- and Graham succeeds on all fronts.  Her screen presence has never been more alluring, and her vibrant personality or even just the way she uses her eyes, is enough to draw you in entirely.  it&#65533;s all a part of the character she creates; there&#65533;s an appeal to Joline that exudes from her entire countenance, who she is inside and out.  She&#65533;s a likable, agreeable person, and because you&#65533;ve shared her innermost thoughts, you know who she is.  It&#65533;s a good job all the way around, beginning with the way the character was written, to the way Graham brings her so vibrantly to life.As Carmen, Patricia Velazquez is totally engaging, as well.  Her performance is very natural and straightforward, and she uses her instincts to effectively create her character.  She has a charismatic presence, but is less than flamboyant, and it gives her an aspect that is attractively down-to-earth.  She is refreshingly open and up-front; you get the impression that Carmen is not one to hold anything back, but is totally honest on all fronts, and that, too, is part of her appeal.  And, as with Joline, this character is well written, and Velazquez brings her convincingly to life.Overall, there is a number of notable performances that are the heart and soul of this film, including those of Luke Wilson, Casey Affleck (as Joline&#65533;s brother, Jay), Goran Visnjic, Alfonso Arau and especially Mark Ruffalo as T-Bo, who, with very little actual screen time, manages to create a memorable character.The supporting cast includes Kim Dickens (Jenny), Clea Du Vall (Mimi), Summer Phoenix (Meg), Art Alexakis (New York Car Thief), Dylan Baker (Carl&#65533;s Editor), and Mary Kay Place (Psychiatrist).  A film that says something about the value of stepping back to consider The Big Picture-- reflecting upon who we are, where we&#65533;re going and what we really need-- &#65533;Committed&#65533; is an enjoyable experience; a ride definitely worth taking.",4,Engaging Film from Lisa Krueger,1013385600,"02 11, 2002",2002,6119,"['people', 'drift', 'life', 'moving', 'one', 'thing', 'one', 'person',

526500,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00003CXIJ,Tsuyoshi,"[5, 7]","Lisa Krueger's second feature has Heather Graham as Joline, New York club owner who is married to a struggling phographer Carl (Luke Wilson).  But this film is not your usual work of romantic comedy, because it has plenty of eccentric characters.  Joline is just one of them, and the strongest one, for she is a committed person to the bone.  Very committed to her action and words, she lets a &quot;band&quot; play on the stage even if all the member except for the bass player quit the band and left for Japan.But her belief is to be tested when her newly-wed husband left her without obvious reasons, afterwards sending only a postcard with a blurred postmark.  But she has to believe what she has  believed, so she decides to hit the road, goes to El Paso, and tries to find something she has been missing in her life.The story is interesting, but you soon find that the film has little to offer except the heroine's engaging personality.  However, the whole film is somehow sustained by Heather Graham's presense, which almost compensates for its meandering plot.  Of course, this means that if you don't like her character, or just don't get it, you lose interest in the film, but for Heather Graham's fans, it is not a bad thing to watch this one for once.Another merit of the film is the unique cast of the film, which includes Casey Affleck, Golan Visnjic, and Alfonso Arau as male players, but more amusing are females, the cameos of Clea Duvall, Summer Phoenix, Patricia Velasquez (one of the best players in the sequel of &quot;The Mummy&quot;), and Mary Kay Place, who was in the director's previous film &quot;Manny &amp; Lo.&quot;  Whether or not they are used in the most suiable way remains a point to be dabated, but it certainly is good to see them showing up on the screen.  And the photography of the film captures the beauty and climate of El Paso very well.&quot;Committed&quot; is not a good film, but still has original concept and lovely Heather Graham, last of which would anyway justify my defending the film.  For her fans, or those who are looking for something totally different.",3,"The Story Goes Nowhere, But Shows Lovely Heather Very Well",1034208000,"10 10, 2002",2002,2110,"['Lisa', 'Krueger', 'second', 'feature', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'Joline', 'New', 'York', 'club', 'owner', 'who', 'married', 'struggling', 'phographer', 'Carl', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'film', 'not', 'usual', 'work', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'plenty', 'eccentric', 'characters', 'Joline', 'just', 'one', 'strongest', 'one', 'committed', 'person', 'bone', 'Very', 'committed', 'action', 'words', 'quot', 'band', 'quot', 'play', 'stage', 'even', 'member', 'bass', 'player', 'quit', 'band', 'left', 'Japan.But', 'belief', 'be', 'tested', 'when', 'newly-wed', 'husband', 'left', 'obvious', 'reasons', 'afterwards', 'sending', 'only', 'postcard', 'blurred', 'postmark', 'believe', 'what', 'believed', 'hit', 'road', 'El', 'Paso', 'tries', 'find', 'something', 'been', 'missing', 'life.The', 'story', 'interesting', 'soon', 'find', 'film', 'little', 'offer', 'heroine', 'engaging', 'personality', 'However', 'whole', 'film', 'somehow', 'sustained', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'presense', 'almost', 'meandering', 'plot', 'course', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'character', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'lose', 'interest', 'film', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'fans', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'watch', 'one', 'once.Another', 'merit', 'film', 'unique', 'cast', 'film', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'Golan', 'Visnjic', 'Alfonso', 'Arau', 'male', 'players', 'more', 'amusing', 'are', 'females', 'cameos', 'Clea', 'Duvall', 'Summer', 'Phoenix', 'Patricia', 'Velasquez', 'one', 'best', 'players', 'sequel', 'quot', 'Mummy', 'quot', 'Mary', 'Kay', 'Place', 'who', 'was', 'director', 'previous', 'film', 'quot', 'Manny', 'amp', 'Lo.', 'quot', 'Whether', 'not', 'are', 'used', 'most', 'suiable', 'way', 'point', 'be', 'dabated', 'certainly', 'good', 'see', 'showing', 'up', 'screen', 'photography', 'film', 'beauty', 'climate', 'El', 'Paso', 'very', 'well.', 'quot', 'Committed', 'quot', 'not', 'good', 'film', 'still', 'original', 'concept', 'lovely', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'last', 'would', 'anyway', 'justify', 'defending', 'film', 'fans', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'something', 'totally', 'different']",N/A
