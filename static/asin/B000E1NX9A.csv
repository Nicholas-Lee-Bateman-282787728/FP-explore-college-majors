966064,A1XI5UAJE5Z6KN,B000E1NX9A,bordersj2,"[0, 0]","I love this movie.  By now most people looking at it or for it have probably already seen the movie and know the plot.  To summarie, Charlie Brown actually... wins!  Sort of.  He enters a Spelling Bee and his success takes him to the big city.  But I think this move, at this point in time is more than just Charlie Brown and the spelling bee.  To me, this movie is a tradition.  I remember always watching it the day after Thanksgiving, almost lock & step with when it came out over 40 years ago.  And I remember that the movie had loads of references to popular and funny moments within the comic, from Charlie's baseball teams to Linus' blanket.But to me, where the movie really shines is with none other than Vince Guaraldi, of course, and the music and musical scenes.  Who can forget the up-beat ""Champion Charlie Brown"" played with guitar and his jubilance being put on ice by his 'friends'?  And what about Snoopy skating in Rockefeller Park in what was my favorite version of the Guaraldi classic, ""Skating""?  The song was so beautifully done with lush strings and arrangements, just like every other song featured in the movie.  The movie is great for holding true to the Charlie Brown comic & appeal as well as the outstanding sountrack that was consistent with just about every other Charlie Brown special of the time.This comes highly recommended.  Though I have to say, I really do wish this would be re-released as a special edition either on regular DVD or Blu-Ray.  Paramount/CBS or whoever teh company is that owns the rights could do something very special - combine the movie with the original soundtrack to this movie that has been out of print for many, many years.  Because as much as I loved the movie, I perhaps enjoyed the soundtrack even more.  ""I before E, except After C"", ""Failure Face"" and loads of other songs featured in this first full length album warrant another look by new fans of the film and perhaps could even spark interest in some of Guaraldi's or McKuen's other works too.",5,"Fantastic Memories, Very Nice Movie",1352246400,"11 7, 2012",2012,2016,"['love', 'movie', 'now', 'most', 'people', 'looking', 'have', 'probably', 'already', 'seen', 'movie', 'know', 'plot', 'summarie', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'actually', 'Sort', 'Spelling', 'Bee', 'success', 'big', 'city', 'think', 'move', 'point', 'time', 'more', 'just', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'spelling', 'bee', 'movie', 'tradition', 'remember', 'always', 'watching', 'day', 'Thanksgiving', 'almost', 'lock', 'step', 'when', 'came', 'out', '40', 'years', 'ago', 'remember', 'movie', 'had', 'loads', 'references', 'popular', 'funny', 'moments', 'comic', 'Charlie', 'baseball', 'teams', 'Linus', 'blanket.But', 'where', 'movie', 'really', 'shines', 'none', 'other', 'Vince', 'Guaraldi', 'course', 'music', 'musical', 'scenes', 'Who', 'can', 'forget', 'up-beat', 'Champion', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'played', 'guitar', 'jubilance', 'being', 'put', 'ice', ""'friends"", 'what', 'Snoopy', 'skating', 'Rockefeller', 'Park', 'what', 'was', 'favorite', 'version', 'Guaraldi', 'classic', 'Skating', 'song', 'was', 'so', 'beautifully', 'done', 'lush', 'strings', 'arrangements', 'just', 'other', 'song', 'featured', 'movie', 'movie', 'great', 'holding', 'true', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'comic', 'appeal', 'as', 'well', 'outstanding', 'sountrack', 'was', 'consistent', 'just', 'other', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'special', 'time.This', 'highly', 'recommended', 'have', 'say', 'really', 'do', 'wish', 'would', 'be', 're-released', 'special', 'edition', 'regular', 'DVD', 'Blu-Ray', 'Paramount/CBS', 'whoever', 'teh', 'company', 'rights', 'could', 'do', 'something', 'very', 'special', 'combine', 'movie', 'original', 'soundtrack', 'movie', 'been', 'print', 'many', 'many', 'years', 'as', 'much', 'loved', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'enjoyed', 'soundtrack', 'even', 'more', 'before', 'E', 'C', 'Failure', 'Face', 'loads', 'other', 'songs', 'featured', 'first', 'full', 'length', 'album', 'warrant', 'look', 'new', 'fans', 'film', 'perhaps', 'could', 'even', 'spark', 'interest', 'Guaraldi', 'McKuen', 'other', 'works', 'too']",N/A

The transition from video to DVD went very nicely for film that was done in 1969 (that's almost 30 years ago for those of you in Rio Linda).I don't know if anybody has mentioned this, but this appears to be the FULL length of the original movie.  When it aired on TV some time in the late 1970's, the song, 'Failure Face', was totally omitted.  Probably considered too mean spirited.  In addition, there are a lot of scenes such as Lucy video taping Charlie Brown kicking the football, Charlie chewing on the weed out of the sidewalk, the Kite flying (fight?) scene.  All of these are NOT on the VHS / clamshell version that I bought in the 1980's.If you grew up with Charlie Brown as I did and miss Charles Schultz, I highly recommend it.

966069,A2BQBLCKJHP65G,B000E1NX9A,"Eric Ericson ""RedSabbath""","[5, 5]","Another in my personal ""I wonder if the little one will sit through this?"" purchases, this is the first of four Peanuts major motion pictures. Made four years after TV classics like ""Charlie Brown Christmas"" and ""Great Pumpkin"", this film doesn't have the yearly replay value of those, but is classic nonetheless. In it, Charlie Brown establishes himself as the worlds first ""emo"" kid with a barrage of disappointment situations that we're all familiar of. Then he decides to try to beat his own curse by competing in the school's spelling bee and reluctantly makes it to state championship. Can this cursed little bald kid finally win at something?Paramount did an odd job with this disc. While it's surprisingly in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen, some of the graphics seem to be cut off on all four sides like it was originally in 1.33:1. And even though the colors/black levels are spot-on & sharp, there is varying degrees of print damage throughout the entire picture, though some may be due to the cel-animation of forty years ago than the master itself. The 5.1/2.0 mixes are new and effective, but at times it's dated jazzy '60's soundtrack doesn't get any more modern sounding because of it. Also too bad that there's not one extra or trailer for it or any other Peanuts video product on it (lost opportunity). But with it's Woodstock-like split screen effects and entertaining storyline, it was well worth the purchase and my little one was entertained, even if she kept asking me when they were finally going Trick-Or-Treating already....Personally growing up on the animation side of Peanuts, I still found it's sequel ""Snoopy, Come Home"" to be a better overall movie, but this one still has plenty to see and enjoy. In fact strangely this release of the film (why did it take until 2006 for this to debut on DVD?) is actually uncut! Meaning Paramount put back in it six whole minutes that were deleted after test audiences in 1969 thought it ran too long. In a way I can see their point, but it's a time-capsule of an era of animation gone way by, like that bald kid's chances of ever kicking that football.

Because I know that you may not read my entire review before giving me an ""unhelpful"" vote, please consider this up front: This review is my honest, sincere opinion. The reason the internet exists is so that we may all get exposed to a variety of viewpoints. I have tried my best to explain in detail why I honestly did not like this movie. As such, I hope that my review will be helpful to all, fans (many) and critics (few) alike. I invite you to rebut my opinion in the ""comments"" section, but in as much as my review helps you to understand why someone may not like this movie, I respectfully ask you to give me a ""helpful"" vote or no vote at all, even though you may disagree with me. Remember, nothing can please everyone.I'm an adult seeing this for the first time, and I have an adult viewpoint. Simply not good. Animation is primitive, music is bad and tedious, not funny at all, and the weak climax does not make up for two hours of painful situations. Charlie, Snoopy, Lucy, Linus, and Schroeder are decently colorful characters. The rest don't even make it to cartoon quality. I did grow up reading Charlie Brown comic strips in paperback form, and I liked it. But it loses its charm in this format.2 hours is way too long, forcing time killing extended sequences.Overuse of the ""Linus and Lucy"" theme gets tedious and shows a lack of diligence.Overuse of the minor key ""Linus and Lucy"" theme got annoying.It's not funny at all. There is one funny opening joke, and then Snoopy gets just a few funny bits, and that's it.You're in severe pain for 90+% of the movie. That's not entertainment.Way too mean with name calling and ridicule. Personally I find name calling and ridicule very offensive in any situation, even more so when it's this extensive. I just don't see the payoff in this movie. CB is a loser, a dumb, dull, unliked, untalented kid that ends up losing and ""the world doesn't end."" I don't see how that's a worthwhile lesson to anyone. The lesson is: no matter how much people call you names, ridicule you, no matter how much you lose in life or no matter that you can't seem to do anything right, somehow it's ok. There may be a nugget of truth in there, but basically having the moviemakers essentially preach to me for two hours that I share those qualities - that's a little condescending, isn't it? But anyway, even if the message were worthwhile, the ending message is so weak and watered down that it doesn't give me a good feeling and erase all the misery I've experienced in the last two hours.It always felt like they were killing time with extended animation exercises. Extended segments: spelling rules, Linus looks for blanket, Snoopy ice-skating, and the Beethoven segment. Except for the spelling rules segment, the other extended segments did not move the story along, with Snoopy and Beethoven completely superfluous. These segments also came across like animation experiments, ""Let's see how realistically we can make Snoopy appear to glide over the ice."" ""Let's make an extended high art collage set to Beethoven's music."" That said: The Beethoven segment was very good and was the highlight of the movie. In fact, it's the only portion I saved for repeated viewing. As a short animation segment it's great, but as far as moving the story of a 2 hour movie along, especially for kids, no.I can't see anyone learning spelling rules from this movie - so educational value is not much. Show this movie to any kid and then see if he can recite even the I before E rule, I don't think so.Music was no good - the spelling bee song was not good.I know it's apples to oranges, but this 1969 movie compared to the work and storytelling that Disney was doing as far back as 1937 (Snow White)?

I hadn't remembered very much about the picture so this viewing was like seeing it fresh. Not surprisingly, A Boy Named Charlie Brown stands the test of time. The story is simple and, like much of the Peanuts vehicles, is somewhat anecdotal. By this I mean that some of the material in the script was clearly lifted from the classic comic strips themselves. Still, there is an overall theme that drives the plot. That is the story of the underdog (Charlie) doing his best, and learning to like himself in spite of his flaws. The animation, though far from Disney quality, is a step above the animation seen in the Peanuts television efforts and better than the later feature efforts. The voice work, by child actors, is also very good. The writing, as can be expected, was top notch. There is also a wonderful title song at the beginning of the film that I found very touching and very appealing. The song, ""A Boy Named Charlie Brown"" was written and is sung by Rod McKuen. It is so good that I am really shocked that it has not become a modern standard. The film looks great, too. The print is sharp and clear and the color is eyepopping.

966083,A1S2H07AYAZ5E4,B000E1NX9A,Robert G. Ernst,"[0, 0]","Before I begin my review, let me start by saying that this was not the first Peanuts movie I watched, the Christmas special was, but I watched this when I was 8, and sporadically but not often over the years, even leaving a gap for about 10 years. I watched it not long ago with my fiance to show her the other movies outside of the holiday specials, I recalled every scene to a T and loved it now like I did then. My personal opinion is that serious fans of Peanuts cartoons/movies that are looking to get in to more than just the holiday specials need to watch this.But let's take a closer look. First of all, please understand that the point of Charlie Brown's character is that ""he's every child in every town."" He is an average kid who is not as successful as he would aspire to be in all he does. He gets socked with line drives that gets him out of his clothes, he contends with a kite eating tree, and Lucy pulling away his football among other things. That's who Charlie Brown is, he can't help it, that's life.But he has a chance to show them that he can be be a winner by entering in a class spelling bee with success, then other spelling bees. The whole movie is based around Charlie Brown and a good portion of it is around him and the spelling bee.There are other scenes in here which don't help the story along so arguably don't need to be in the movie, but if you don't think of those scenes like that, you have a better chance of appreciating the beauty in the scene. The different animation, the music, Schultz seems to be experimenting with the limits of what animation could do in the 1960's. Even though the scenes are erroneous, the scenes are regarded as some of the most memorable, and it's not just me. These scenes include (but are not limited to) Schroeder playing Beethoven's Pathetique Sonata and Snoopy skating and playing hockey at the Rockefeller Center Ice Rink.The plot is realistic for Peanuts and is a good example of how Peanuts is for kids of all ages.",4,A must have for fans,1265587200,"02 8, 2010",2010,1990,"['begin', 'review', 'let', 'start', 'saying', 'was', 'not', 'first', 'Peanuts', 'movie', 'watched', 'Christmas', 'special', 'was', 'watched', 'when', 'was', '8', 'sporadically', 'not', 'often', 'years', 'even', 'leaving', 'gap', '10', 'years', 'watched', 'not', 'long', 'ago', 'fiance', 'show', 'other', 'movies', 'holiday', 'specials', 'recalled', 'scene', 'T', 'loved', 'now', 'did', 'then', 'My', 'personal', 'opinion', 'serious', 'fans', 'Peanuts', 'cartoons/movies', 'are', 'looking', 'get', 'more', 'just', 'holiday', 'specials', 'need', 'watch', 'this.But', 'let', 'take', 'closer', 'look', 'First', 'please', 'understand', 'point', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'character', 'child', 'town', 'average', 'kid', 'who', 'not', 'as', 'successful', 'would', 'aspire', 'be', 'socked', 'line', 'drives', 'clothes', 'kite', 'eating', 'tree', 'Lucy', 'pulling', 'away', 'football', 'other', 'things', 'who', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'life.But', 'chance', 'show', 'can', 'be', 'be', 'winner', 'entering', 'class', 'spelling', 'bee', 'success', 'then', 'other', 'spelling', 'bees', 'whole', 'movie', 'based', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'good', 'portion', 'spelling', 'are', 'other', 'scenes', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'help', 'story', 'so', 'arguably', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'scenes', 'have', 'better', 'chance', 'appreciating', 'beauty', 'scene', 'different', 'animation', 'music', 'Schultz', 'be', 'experimenting', 'limits', 'what', 'animation', 'could', 'do', '1960', 'Even', 'scenes', 'are', 'erroneous', 'scenes', 'are', 'regarded', 'most', 'memorable', 'not', 'just', 'scenes', 'include', 'are', 'not', 'limited', 'Schroeder', 'playing', 'Beethoven', 'Pathetique', 'Sonata', 'Snoopy', 'skating', 'playing', 'hockey', 'Rockefeller', 'Center', 'Ice', 'Rink.The', 'plot', 'realistic', 'Peanuts', 'good', 'example', 'how', 'Peanuts', 'kids', 'ages']",N/A
