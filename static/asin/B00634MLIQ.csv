1508941,A2ODRZ9GBMKT51,B00634MLIQ,Bigburito,"[8, 9]","this is a really great set, you get three comic book movies (all three of which are quite good) they all have special features and all in all it's a great packagefirst off is the packaging, they put all three discs in a single case, it's compact and the discs are easy to get out so A+ (it also doesn't have any of that ""recycling bullcrap where they take out chunks of the case)second off the movies themselves,V for Vendetta: this movie is worth the price of the whole set by itself, it's a combination of an action/suspense thriller that is the highlight of the set. the action is fluid and beautiful, the dialogue is pure poetry, and the foreshadowing has a nice balance of easy to get things and more difficult ones which makes it so that you feel great about catching a tidbit here and there but also makes it even more enjoyable on return viewings where preexisting knowledge lets you catch the subtle foreshadowing.Watchmen Director's cut: first off props to warner bros for putting the directors cut on here instead of the basic version, it adds a lot of value to this set. this movie is quite good though I must say it was very overhyped but on a second watch it was true to the comic most of the way through and generally was a fun movie.Constantine: this one came as a complete shock, I had only heard meh reviews for this movie so I didn't have much hope for it going in but honestly it was the high point of the set. it's a great story that's quite interesting, you don't need to have read the comics to understand it, it uses some great cgi (the graphics themselves are actually kind of low quality but the art style that is used with it masks the deficiencies quite well to give a few scenes some beautiful scenery), keanu reeves's emotionless acting actually complements the characters so he doesn't feel out of place, and it's just a fun movie. the only thing I had an issue with is the special features, first off there are quite a few on the constantine dvd second off they are in something closer to VHS quality than they are Blu-ray quality which is really a shame given how interesting some of them actually are.overall I highly recommend this set, three great movies at a solid price. you can't go wrong with this set.",5,amazing set at an amazing price,1352419200,"11 9, 2012",2012,2242,"['really', 'great', 'set', 'get', 'three', 'comic', 'book', 'movies', 'three', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'have', 'special', 'features', 'great', 'packagefirst', 'off', 'packaging', 'put', 'three', 'discs', 'single', 'case', 'compact', 'discs', 'are', 'easy', 'get', 'out', 'so', 'A+', 'also', ""n't"", 'have', 'recycling', 'bullcrap', 'where', 'take', 'out', 'chunks', 'case', 'second', 'off', 'movies', 'V', 'Vendetta', 'movie', 'price', 'whole', 'set', 'combination', 'action/suspense', 'thriller', 'highlight', 'set', 'action', 'fluid', 'beautiful', 'dialogue', 'pure', 'poetry', 'foreshadowing', 'nice', 'balance', 'easy', 'get', 'things', 'more', 'difficult', 'ones', 'feel', 'great', 'catching', 'tidbit', 'here', 'there', 'also', 'even', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'return', 'viewings', 'where', 'preexisting', 'knowledge', 'lets', 'catch', 'subtle', 'foreshadowing.Watchmen', 'Director', 'cut', 'first', 'props', 'warner', 'bros', 'putting', 'directors', 'cut', 'here', 'instead', 'basic', 'version', 'lot', 'value', 'set', 'movie', 'quite', 'good', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'very', 'overhyped', 'second', 'watch', 'was', 'true', 'comic', 'most', 'way', 'generally', 'was', 'fun', 'movie.Constantine', 'one', 'came', 'complete', 'shock', 'had', 'only', 'heard', 'meh', 'reviews', 'movie', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'hope', 'going', 'honestly', 'was', 'high', 'point', 'set', 'great', 'story', 'quite', 'interesting', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'have', 'read', 'comics', 'understand', 'great', 'cgi', 'graphics', 'are', 'actually', 'kind', 'low', 'quality', 'art', 'style', 'used', 'deficiencies', 'quite', 'well', 'give', 'few', 'scenes', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'keanu', 'reeves', 'emotionless', 'acting', 'actually', 'characters', 'so', ""n't"", 'feel', 'place', 'just', 'fun', 'movie', 'only', 'thing', 'had', 'issue', 'special', 'features', 'first', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'constantine', 'second', 'are', 'something', 'closer', 'VHS', 'quality', 'are', 'Blu-ray', 'quality', 'really', 'shame', 'given', 'how', 'interesting', 'actually', 'are.overall', 'highly', 'recommend', 'set', 'three', 'great', 'movies', 'solid', 'price', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'set']",V for Vendetta / Watchmen / Constantine

Bryan,"[0, 0]",I owned the DVD versions of all three of these and thanks to this I was able to open up some shelf space and upgrade to Blu-ray.V for Vendetta isn't the action packed movie that some thought it would be.  There is more to the story than jumping around throwing knives.  I think that lead to the negative reception but it has lead to my enjoyment of the movie.  There is a good moral to the story and I think everyone should watch it with an open mind just once at least.Watchmen has a good bit of action and also poses some interesting questions and moral dilemmas.  Some of the purists may have hated this but it brought the story to many that would never have experienced it.Constantine is just a good supernatural action flick.  There is a good story but this is much more about Keanu Reeves killing demons in my opinion.Buy this for a cheap way to enjoy them all. It includes all of the special features that came on the DVDs that I had at least and I don't know of any that are missing other than the digital copy that came with my copy of Watchmen.,5,"3 Great Movies, 1 convenient case",1387411200,"12 19, 2013",2013,1054,"['owned', 'DVD', 'versions', 'three', 'thanks', 'was', 'able', 'open', 'up', 'shelf', 'space', 'upgrade', 'Blu-ray.V', 'Vendetta', ""n't"", 'action', 'packed', 'movie', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'story', 'jumping', 'throwing', 'knives', 'think', 'lead', 'negative', 'reception', 'lead', 'enjoyment', 'movie', 'good', 'moral', 'story', 'think', 'everyone', 'should', 'watch', 'open', 'mind', 'just', 'once', 'least.Watchmen', 'good', 'bit', 'action', 'also', 'interesting', 'questions', 'moral', 'dilemmas', 'purists', 'may', 'have', 'hated', 'brought', 'story', 'many', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'experienced', 'it.Constantine', 'just', 'good', 'supernatural', 'action', 'flick', 'good', 'story', 'much', 'more', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'killing', 'demons', 'opinion.Buy', 'cheap', 'way', 'enjoy', 'special', 'features', 'came', 'DVDs', 'had', 'least', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'are', 'missing', 'other', 'digital', 'copy', 'came', 'copy', 'Watchmen']",V for Vendetta / Watchmen / Constantine

What's not to love??I never saw V for Vendetta when it was released. I thought the V character looked doofy in the grinning harlequin mask so I passed on it. Silly me. Like most British films, there is far more talk than action, but the talk is weighty and well thought out and leaves you with something to discuss after the film's over besides how cool the explosions or stunts were. Nice.Watchmen will never be as good as the source material, but with few exceptions, what is? Others can give yo far more info on the film & the graphic novels than me. Seek out those critics & user reviews if you're really interested. I enjoyed the movie more or less and appreciate that someone at least TRIED to bring the books to the big screen. The success of that adaption... well...My wife & I both enjoyed Constantine. I still think someone far older than Keanu Reeves should have played the part but the film as a whole was pretty good.

1508948,A2WWXKYRFOLZ8Q,B00634MLIQ,James W. Cornwell,"[2, 2]","Constantine the clear cut worst movie of the set, and still worth an occasional watch, but the gems are V for Vendetta and the Watchmen.  I owned V and Constantine already, enjoyed both, but I had them on DVD and with a 1080p TV, BluRay is a much better way to go,  I did not have the Watchmen and only just watched it for the first time.  This movie is not your usual happy super hero movie, it's closer to an extremely dark, and thoroughly adult version of The Incredibles.  You see this movie collecting dust in so many value bins that you question if it's worth watching.  The question shouldn't be whether it's worth watching, but how many times is it worth watching.  It plays out a little obviously for a bit with you feeling like you have the ending guessed at, and then it flops, didn't see it coming, and man, makes sense.  V for Vendetta is another good dark hero movie.  From what I've read, if you loved the graphic novel, you may feel ripped off by the movie, having not any experience with the written version, I greatly enjoyed the movie.
