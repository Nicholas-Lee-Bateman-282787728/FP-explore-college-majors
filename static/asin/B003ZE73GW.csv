Note that I didn't say on Canadian TV. Spooks in the UK and the second half of 24 were close, though The Border was a series that was coming into its own. The show has a wide cult following and I have heard nothing of ratings issues, so why did the CBC take off their schedule? Personally painful is that I now have to get my Grace Park fix via a remake of Hawaii Five O! First Intelligence and now The Border! I am guessing that there must be some corporate strategy where a hit show is developed and then cancelled before it's time?I highly recommend watching all 3-seasons!",5,Shame on the CBC!,1294272000,"01 6, 2011",2011,698,"['Not', 'only', 'do', 'end', 'series', 'cliff', 'hanger', 'show', 'was', 'best', 'TV', 'period', '2009/2010', 'TV', 'season', 'Note', 'did', ""n't"", 'say', 'Canadian', 'TV', 'Spooks', 'UK', 'second', 'half', '24', 'were', 'close', 'Border', 'was', 'series', 'was', 'coming', 'own', 'show', 'wide', 'cult', 'following', 'have', 'heard', 'nothing', 'ratings', 'issues', 'so', 'why', 'did', 'CBC', 'take', 'off', 'schedule', 'Personally', 'painful', 'now', 'have', 'get', 'Grace', 'Park', 'fix', 'remake', 'Hawaii', 'Five', 'O', 'First', 'Intelligence', 'now', 'Border', 'am', 'guessing', 'must', 'be', 'corporate', 'strategy', 'where', 'hit', 'show', 'developed', 'then', 'cancelled', 'time', 'highly', 'recommend', 'watching', '3-seasons']",The Border - Season Three
1377304,A1I5LC05HZJ9CF,B003ZE73GW,"Kanenberg ""50kmwalk""","[6, 6]","The Border Season 3; the last season; their is no more; I enjoyed the first 2 seasons of the show and knew 'going in' this 3rd season was it. What I didn't know was how shocking the ending would be and what my reaction would be? So without giving away the plot let me just say my reaction was ""Wow, that was incredible"". Like many viewers I'm sure, I was left breathless and upset by how the show ended for a few minutes and was mad their would be no more episodes. But then I thought--the ending was awesome because you don't know what will happen to the characters and you never will and your left intensely wanting MORE! A TV show that effects you so much you want MORE? That's not a BAD thing I realized, its a great thing. The show got me so invested I was mad it didn't continue; how many TV shows can you say that about? Not many in my experience.So the 3rd season continues the same story lines from S-1,and 2, with the ICS Agents working closely with Grace Park from the Dep't of Homeland Security, and like before they are fast paced with just the right mix of action/drama and living up to the description of the show as ""24 meets MI-5"". I can't imagine why CBC cancelled this show cause I thought it was great and different enough from typical ""American"" cop/spy/CSI type shows to gather a loyal following and high ratings. But...lots of shows I think are great get cancelled and lots of ones I think are crap stay on--so be it. This series was 38 great episodes, or nearly 40 hours of 'edge of your seat' entertainment--so who says their is nothing good on TV? And the show ends with a scene reminiscent of the movie ""Butch Cassidy & the Sundance Kid"" a movie made in 1969 and where the 'ending' is still talked about.
