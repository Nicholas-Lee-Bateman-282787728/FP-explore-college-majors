This was different.  She and her son have almost an &#34;Oedipus&#34; relationship, and his murder triggers some horrific almost sic-fi type events.  The soft-porn was done well - the young wife of Jessica Lange's now dead son, feeling tricked into marriage and sorely lacking love in her life, is swept into a relationship with her husband's best friend.  But from that moment on the film story spirals down into a psychological study of murder and suicide??!!?? As the two young people lay by the river's edge in the throws of death - after drinking their intentionally poisoned wine, Jessica Lange (who has had a debilitating stroke) looks on - with her stroke-ravaged face in triumph at their death.  They had drowned her son, and she had her revenge - but to want advantage?

1694576,A1K3SFTY71SH6Q,B00IKM5OTW,D. Holmes,"[43, 45]","From its first frame onward, In Secret is a Gothic, hypnotic, often sexy, and at times disturbing story of people who, either by choice or because of fate, become imprisoned within negative circumstances and spin further and further out of control.  The film opens with a wayward father leaving his daughter, heroine Therese, at the isolated home of his sister and her ill son, Camille.  The aunt is portrayed by Jessica Lange with the regal and steely quality in which she now specializes and uses to steal scenes on the television hit American Horror Story.  Coming of age, Therese is forced to be at once best friend, guardian angel, and nurse to the wan Camille.  Later, she is forced also to be his wife on the eve of the family's move to Paris.  There, they purchase an out-of-the-way shop and reunite with a friendly past acquaintance, Laurent.  Artistic, confident, and masculine, Laurent is the antithesis of her husband.  He and the previously cold and sequestered Therese become clandestine lovers and plot to stay together at any price.In Secret possesses every ingredient of a top-notch costume drama and erotic suspense film.  The performances are engaging and vibrant, which is no surprise since leads Elizabeth Olsen (as the adult Therese) and Oscar Isaac (as Laurent) are among the brightest talents of their generation.  She in particular perfectly captures the dynamic of her character, a woman who reveals menacing dimensions of her character out of justified desperation to escape her static domestic existence.  Each note of anger, desire, fear, and guilt rings true.  This authenticity reveals and animates a century-old story, scandalous in its day, for a jaded modern audience.  The production itself is gorgeous in its cobwebs and shadows and stones and general grit, with Hungary and Serbia standing in well for 19th-century France.  Call it seductive decay, never more so than during a delirious nocturnal visit to a slaughterhouse.  And the plot is rich and told with theatrical flair, from the way the character arcs complicate our initial understanding of each player to a spectacular ending which is haunting and, in a macabre way, satisfying in its ghastly inevitability.",5,"A hypnotic, sexy, and unfairly ignored costume drama with an ace cast",1397260800,"04 12, 2014",2014,2204,"['first', 'frame', 'onward', 'Secret', 'Gothic', 'hypnotic', 'often', 'sexy', 'times', 'disturbing', 'story', 'people', 'who', 'either', 'choice', 'fate', 'become', 'imprisoned', 'negative', 'circumstances', 'spin', 'further', 'further', 'control', 'film', 'wayward', 'father', 'leaving', 'daughter', 'heroine', 'Therese', 'isolated', 'home', 'sister', 'ill', 'son', 'Camille', 'aunt', 'portrayed', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'regal', 'steely', 'quality', 'now', 'steal', 'scenes', 'television', 'hit', 'American', 'Horror', 'Story', 'Coming', 'age', 'Therese', 'forced', 'be', 'once', 'best', 'friend', 'guardian', 'angel', 'nurse', 'wan', 'Camille', 'Later', 'forced', 'also', 'be', 'wife', 'eve', 'family', 'move', 'Paris', 'purchase', 'out-of-the-way', 'shop', 'reunite', 'friendly', 'past', 'acquaintance', 'Laurent', 'Artistic', 'confident', 'masculine', 'Laurent', 'antithesis', 'husband', 'previously', 'cold', 'sequestered', 'Therese', 'become', 'clandestine', 'lovers', 'plot', 'stay', 'together', 'price.In', 'Secret', 'ingredient', 'top-notch', 'costume', 'drama', 'erotic', 'suspense', 'film', 'performances', 'are', 'engaging', 'vibrant', 'surprise', 'Elizabeth', 'Olsen', 'adult', 'Therese', 'Oscar', 'Isaac', 'Laurent', 'are', 'brightest', 'talents', 'generation', 'particular', 'perfectly', 'dynamic', 'character', 'woman', 'who', 'menacing', 'dimensions', 'character', 'justified', 'desperation', 'escape', 'static', 'domestic', 'existence', 'note', 'anger', 'desire', 'fear', 'guilt', 'rings', 'true', 'authenticity', 'reveals', 'century-old', 'story', 'scandalous', 'day', 'jaded', 'modern', 'audience', 'production', 'gorgeous', 'cobwebs', 'shadows', 'stones', 'general', 'grit', 'Hungary', 'Serbia', 'standing', 'well', '19th-century', 'France', 'Call', 'seductive', 'decay', 'never', 'more', 'so', 'delirious', 'nocturnal', 'visit', 'slaughterhouse', 'plot', 'rich', 'told', 'theatrical', 'flair', 'way', 'character', 'arcs', 'complicate', 'initial', 'understanding', 'player', 'spectacular', 'ending', 'haunting', 'macabre', 'way', 'satisfying', 'ghastly', 'inevitability']",In Secret Digital

A young girl is left to live with a very controlling aunt who has a sick and pampered son.  She grows up learning to sit still and be quiet but she has a passion inside that she finds hard to control.  She ends up marrying her cousin and the whole family moves to Paris where she meets Laurent.  She and Laurent have an instant physical chemistry which quickly leads to an affair. Their longing to be together causes them to make a decision that alters everything.  It is at this point that the movie quickly became overly dramatic and truly boring.  I honestly stopped it once to see how much longer it had to play because I thought I'd been watching for well over two hours. The movie run time is a little less than 2 hours total.  It wasn't just one thing but more like the movie just fell apart about half way through.  The acting became wooden.  There were characters and scenes included which didn't seem to make sense or have any meaning to the outcome.

1694585,A29XWXJ525HH7O,B00IKM5OTW,MyD -- The Viewpoint,"[2, 2]","THIS IS EMILE ZOLA, NOT AUSTEN OR EVEN BRONTE THAT MANY ARE USED TO.Put away the pastels and forget about tea parties and gala balls. This beautifully shot, intelligent period piece deals more with depths and passions of the human heart than it does the pretty faade of the upper crust. This brooding tale is from Emile Zola, based on his first major novel Th&eacute;r&egrave;se Raquin. Zola's intent was to conduct a study of temperaments as he called it, not a character study or thriller. That does not make for great cinema so the movie departs in that the character development is quite exceptional, along with the acting bringing it to life. Some other modest, but significant, departures are made from Zola's work, but I will not give spoilers. There are beautiful shots of countryside, but mostly this movie trades bright scenes and happy drawing rooms we are used to for the sooty, grimy streets of lower class Paris in the 1860's. This movie has been billed as an erotic thriller. This is not really the case, but that grabs media attention. Zola considered himself a theatrical naturalist (so the more natural or broader range of emotion is appropriate here). Later it shows the more extreme results of one's actions. One might better call this a social criticism that was common of French writers of that day and the pessimism around the problems of the second and third French Republics.THE PLOT: Little Therese is abandoned by her father into the hands of her aunt, Madame Raquin, and her sickly, overly mothered son. They are not particularly evil to her, but she is trapped in a life of servitude and complete lack of self determination. As she matures, the movie quickly establishes that she is a passionate young woman as she spies on a local farmer scything crops while shirtless. Not long after, Madame Raquin announces that Therese will marry her sickly and unappealing son who has just obtained employment in Paris. After all, it is a good result for a young lady with no family or prospects. Unfortunately, she has been raised pretty much as a sister to this sickly man who is, in fact, still her first cousin. The scene of their arrival in Paris is symbolic of her state as the camera shifts to a darkened street view to focus on her through a window of their shop with bars for protection, but bars none the less. Zola's work describes her environment as a tomb rather than a prison as seen in the movie. Therese is unsettled later by the appearance of her husband's friend and colleague from work who is also an artist. Of course she hates him, yet is drawn to him as a breath of fresh air to her prison of a life. He seduces her with subtle tales of his work posing models while he painted them, a nudge of the thigh, a touch of a brush. Everything comes to a head and simultaneously unravels as they realize their attraction.Reception of this movie was mixed by both critics and audiences alike. Those looking for a pretty period drama were perhaps ambushed if they didn't do their research before watching. Those looking for the erotic thriller found something perhaps less titillating, shocking, or even that surprising. Rather, they found a more intelligent piece possessing depth and true emotion, but hard to interpret without context. Nonetheless, it was not what most people expected. Since it is a study, the point is not fantastic plot twists or shiny ornamentation.First and foremost, Elizabeth Olsen brings an emotional range to a Victorian woman that is realistic and palpable, yet rarely portrayed in most of our cinema. Not to mention those unusual and lovely Olsen facial features that contrast the more traditional style cast in period drama. All the time she still manages to maintain the period character deftly while exuding that emotional range. The scene where she pretends to be a bear in bed to elicit a response from her husband was hilarious and adorable! He had just been explaining his fascination with the zoo and his walks there. Jessica Lang shows she still has tremendous moments of drama left in her career. This is one of her greatest recent works. Tom Felton as Therese's husband is transformed. He played an intentionally annoying, though maybe physical appealing, character in Harry Potter. Here it the opposite. In this more serious role, he is the persona of the weak, mothered, sickly husband who simply has no idea of how to make his wife happy. He is utterly physically and emotionally unappealing, but not a bad person at all.If you knew this was Zola before watching, you probably knew what you were getting into. With those same expectations, choose it or avoid it based on what appeals to you. Those going into it with the right expectations will be richly rewarded. Though plays and operas have been made of Zola's work, I do not think they are easily translated into modern cinema. The fact they did it so well here is a testament to the writing, acting, and production values of this movie. I was not so much entertained as I really appreciated the piece. It is bleak, sensual, and emotional. There are only the slightest snippets of flesh, but plenty of sexual situations. If you are still interested, I suggest trying a rental first.",4,"PERIOD DRAMA WITH A DARKER, MORE SENSUAL, MORE HUMAN HEART -- & why some may not enjoy this movie",1403395200,"06 22,

The book definitely gives more detail which makes the story hang together a bit better, but even without familiarity with the book, this does a fantastic job of seeing the world through the eyes and actions of people who are probably like no one you've ever encountered (thankfully).The way it is shot, with such low light, gives a feel of authenticity and also highlights the contrast between the dark, drab existence inside the Raquin household and everywhere else. The scenes do a great job of showing Laurent's many sides so he is deeply disturbing, yet also understandable as well as Madame Raquin's horrid flaws, emotions (even when she can't talk!), and motivations.

1694592,A107ZX1O8JZCN5,B00IKM5OTW,"Vicki Hopkins, Author ""Vicki Hopkins, Author""","[8, 10]","**Contains Spoilers**I can honestly classify it as the most depressing film I have seen in a long time.  The film is apparently based on a story by the name of Th&eacute;r&egrave;se Raquin,"" written in 1867 by Emile Zola.In short, the movie is about a young girl, who after her mother dies, is placed with her aunt and her sick, coughing cousin. Jessica Lange plays a controlling mother (Madame Raquin), who orchestrates Therese's life at every turn. Her father passes away, and Therese is left with a small annuity. No doubt for her own financial gain, she insists that Therese marry her cousin. Unfortunately, he is not appealing in personality or looks, while she on the other hand is attracted to handsome men and deals with an uncontrollable sex drive.When they relocate from the country to Paris, down a dark and dingy street to open a shop, Therese meets Laurent, a friend of the family. It doesn't take long for the two of them to fall into a lust-driven, sexual relationship that borders on the ridiculous as they meet in secret. Her domineering aunt has no idea that while she is tending the store below, her niece is copulating like a nymphomaniac upstairs in the room she shares with her son. Though you are led to believe it is love between the two, I frankly thought it bordered on physical obsession. Her lover knows how to control her need for him by pleasuring her at every turn, just as well as her aunt who manipulates her to do her bidding.As far as Therese's husband, played by Tom Felton, he is a boring and idiotic man, and a mama's boy. His relationship with his mother is frankly as sickly as his health (cough, cough), as his mother dominates and coddles him into adulthood.Laurent, as sexually driven as Therese, wants her all to himself. He suggests that they orchestrate an accident to do away with her husband. After all, accidents happen every day. Therese is hesitant to carry out the plan, but Laurent takes it to the end when the three of them go boating. He pushes her husband overboard, beats him with a paddle, and they watch him drown. Of course, they are dragged back to shore feigning a terrible boating accident wherein he loses his life. His body is recovered, buried, and no one is the wiser, except for one family friend who has her suspicions.Of course, after the murder and time passes, Laurent and Therese marry and live together with Madame Raquin at the shop. Their relationship turns  sour very quickly, as guilt for murdering Camille and their debase personalities come to the forefront. In the meantime, Madame Raquin has a stroke, no doubt brought on by her excessive grief over her son's death, and is left unable to move or speak.  As she is confined to a wheelchair, she discovers through their yelling fights with one another that they murdered her son.Well, where does this leave this sordid tale of dysfunctional family, adultery, lust, and whatever else you want to term it? It comes to an end where Therese and Laurent grow to hate each other so much they plot each other's demise. In the end, they both go mad as a hatter, and commit suicide in front of Madame Raquin, who finally obtains justice for her son's murder. The scene is no Romeo and Juliet moment, believe me. Instead, it is a sad commentary to two selfish people who committed a senseless murder that leads to no happy ending.As far as performances, Jessica Lange, I thought carried the insatiable grief about her son's death to a psychotic level. Whether it was the intention of her performance to do so because or the script, I have no idea. However, I thought it felt excessive. Elizabeth Olsen's portrayal, as well as Oscar Isaac's, as the colliding lovers (definitely not star-crossed lovers), were well done conveying the characters' crazy drive for sex and ultimate demise due to guilt that borders on lunacy.The setting overall, especially in Paris, is very dark and gloomy, which frankly mirrors the story. The  costumes were mid-Victorian era and dull in color for the most part.If you like depressing, dark, and dramatic period movies that leave you feeling uninspired, this one is for you.",2,"Dark, Gloomy, Uninspiring Story",1402272000,"06 9, 2014",2014,4126,"['**Contains', 'Spoilers**I', 'can', 'honestly', 'classify', 'most', 'depressing', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'film', 'apparently', 'based', 'story', 'name', 'Th', 'eacute', 'r', 'egrave', 'se', 'Raquin', 'written', '1867', 'Emile', 'Zola.In', 'short', 'movie', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'mother', 'dies', 'placed', 'aunt', 'sick', 'coughing', 'cousin', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'controlling', 'mother', 'Madame', 'Raquin', 'who', 'Therese', 'life', 'turn', 'father', 'away', 'Therese', 'left', 'small', 'annuity', 'doubt', 'own', 'financial', 'gain', 'Therese', 'marry', 'cousin', 'Unfortunately', 'not', 'appealing', 'personality', 'other', 'hand', 'attracted', 'handsome', 'men', 'deals', 'uncontrollable', 'sex', 'drive.When', 'relocate', 'country', 'Paris', 'down', 'dark', 'dingy', 'street', 'open', 'shop', 'Therese', 'meets', 'Laurent', 'friend', 'family', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'two', 'fall', 'lust-driven', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'borders', 'ridiculous', 'meet', 'secret', 'domineering', 'aunt', 'idea', 'tending', 'store', 'niece', 'copulating', 'nymphomaniac', 'upstairs', 'room', 'shares', 'son', 'are', 'led', 'believe', 'love', 'two', 'frankly', 'thought', 'bordered', 'physical', 'obsession', 'lover', 'how', 'control', 'need', 'pleasuring', 'turn', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'aunt', 'who', 'do', 'bidding.As', 'far', 'Therese', 'husband', 'played', 'Tom', 'Felton', 'boring', 'idiotic', 'man', 'mama', 'boy', 'relationship', 'mother', 'frankly', 'as', 'sickly', 'health', 'cough', 'cough', 'mother', 'dominates', 'adulthood.Laurent', 'sexually', 'driven', 'Therese', 'orchestrate', 'accident', 'do', 'away', 'husband', 'accidents', 'happen', 'day', 'Therese', 'hesitant', 'carry', 'out', 'plan', 'Laurent', 'end', 'when', 'three', 'go', 'boating', 'husband', 'overboard', 'paddle', 'watch', 'drown', 'course', 'are', 'dragged', 'back', 'shore', 'feigning', 'terrible', 'boating', 'accident', 'wherein', 'life', 'body', 'recovered', 'buried', 'one', 'wiser', 'one', 'family', 'friend', 'who', 'suspicions.Of', 'course', 'murder', 'time', 'passes', 'Laurent', 'Therese', 'marry', 'live', 'together', 'Madame', 'Raquin', 'shop', 'relationship', 'sour', 'very', 'quickly', 'guilt', 'murdering', 'Camille', 'debase', 'come', 'forefront', 'meantime', 'Madame', 'Raquin', 'stroke', 'doubt', 'brought', 'excessive', 'grief', 'son', 'death', 'left', 'unable', 'move', 'speak', 'confined', 'wheelchair', 'yelling', 'fights', 'one', 'murdered', 'son.Well', 'where', 'leave', 'sordid', 'tale', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'adultery', 'lust', 'else', 'want', 'term', 'end', 'where', 'Therese', 'Laurent', 'grow', 'hate', 'other', 'so', 'much', 'plot', 'other', 'demise', 'end', 'go', 'mad', 'hatter', 'commit', 'suicide', 'front', 'Madame', 'Raquin', 'who', 'finally', 'justice', 'son', 'murder', 'scene', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'moment', 'believe', 'Instead', 'sad', 'commentary', 'two', 'selfish', 'people', 'who', 'committed', 'senseless', 'murder', 'happy', 'ending.As', 'far', 'performances', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'thought', 'carried', 'insatiable', 'grief', 'son', 'death', 'psychotic', 'level', 'was', 'intention', 'performance', 'do', 'so', 'script', 'have', 'idea', 'However', 'thought', 'felt', 'excessive', 'Elizabeth', 'Olsen', 'portrayal', 'as', 'well', 'Oscar', 'Isaac', 'colliding', 'lovers', 'definitely', 'not', 'star-crossed', 'lovers', 'were', 'well', 'done', 'conveying', 'characters', 'crazy', 'drive', 'sex', 'ultimate', 'demise', 'due', 'guilt', 'borders', 'lunacy.The', 'setting', 'overall', 'especially', 'Paris', 'very', 'dark', 'gloomy', 'mirrors', 'story', 'costumes', 'were', 'mid-Victorian', 'era', 'dull', 'color', 'most', 'part.If', 'depressing', 'dark', 'dramatic', 'period', 'movies', 'leave', 'feeling', 'uninspired', 'one']",In Secret Digital
