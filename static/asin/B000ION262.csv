Maybe they were hyping up Eric Lindros and I thought ""Cool."" but The Flyers have been my favorite team since I can remember. Ive stuck with the Flyers even though they had lost mostly every game last year, goaltenders who are great in regular season but cant cut it in the playoffs, and ever since Lindros was captain- every captain of the Flyers have got injuried, traded, or retired. Ive stuck with them but I cant say im a ultimate Flyers fan, I was not born in there glory days of the 70's. I love this set and it might not be the greatest games but Flyers fans choose them, so they must know something. I think it sucks they dont have a game with Eric Lindros or the Legion of Doom line from the time I proclaimed them my favorite team. A very good set and I highly recommend it to any Flyer's fan.",5,Great set,1201132800,"01 24, 2008",2008,853,"['dont', 'know', 'why', 'i', ""'ve"", 'always', 'liked', 'Flyers', 'Maybe', 'were', 'hyping', 'up', 'Eric', 'Lindros', 'thought', 'Cool', 'Flyers', 'have', 'been', 'favorite', 'team', 'can', 'remember', 'Ive', 'stuck', 'Flyers', 'even', 'had', 'lost', 'mostly', 'game', 'last', 'year', 'goaltenders', 'who', 'are', 'great', 'regular', 'season', 'cant', 'cut', 'playoffs', 'ever', 'Lindros', 'was', 'captain-', 'captain', 'Flyers', 'have', 'got', 'injuried', 'traded', 'retired', 'Ive', 'stuck', 'cant', 'say', 'im', 'ultimate', 'Flyers', 'fan', 'was', 'not', 'born', 'glory', 'days', '70', 'love', 'set', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'greatest', 'games', 'Flyers', 'fans', 'choose', 'must', 'know', 'something', 'think', 'dont', 'have', 'game', 'Eric', 'Lindros', 'Legion', 'Doom', 'line', 'time', 'proclaimed', 'favorite', 'team', 'very', 'good', 'set', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Flyer', 'fan']",NHL - Philadelphia Flyers 10 Greatest Games Set

Unlike the Penguins series it covers games from over a 30 year period of Flyers history.  So one can see the Flyers clinching the cup in the mid 70's to a the modern day pre lockout Flyers.  Plus one gets to the Soviet Union at the height of their hockey power as well.,5,Flyers,1212192000,"05 31, 2008",2008,318,"['excellent', 'series', 'put', 'out', 'NHL', 'Penguins', 'series', 'games', '30', 'year', 'period', 'Flyers', 'history', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'Flyers', 'clinching', 'cup', 'mid', '70', 'modern', 'day', 'pre', 'Flyers', 'one', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'height', 'hockey', 'power', 'well']",NHL - Philadelphia Flyers 10 Greatest Games Set

There are no games from the 1997 Stanley Cup Finals season and two games from 2004.
