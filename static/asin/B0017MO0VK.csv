1157473,A1GA996JHP23Y3,B0017MO0VK,Douglas Maclean,"[6, 8]","This may be the first screenplay offered up by Harry Shannon but he is a man of considerable experience in the horror genre. He has been a successful novelist in the genre for many years now with his books well received by the critics and public. He is a man of many talents including composing and performing music. His novels cover topics that range from suspense, mystery and even a werewolf or two thrown in for good measure. With such a versatile background this film could not do better in the script department. Shannon wrote the theme song for the flick and took a turn in front of the camera. He provides the first twist in the plot by having the trophy spouse as the husband. The couple on the verge of finical ruin so he takes his comatose wife up to a remote cabin in the woods, something he won in a poker game. Naturally, as things go in stories like this, the area has a bad reputation. Awhile back a man went crazy in that cabin and killed his family. The isolation begins to wear on the man until he is not sure what is real and what just his overactive imagination. This is one aspect of the story that sets it above the pack. There are elements of a psychological thriller blended in that keeps the audience constantly guessing as to what will happen next. Shannon was influenced by the old EC horror comic that infused dark humor into the stories. He takes a similar approach here breaking up the tension with such black comedy. This doesn't impede the movement of the plot it just gives the audience a little change of pace and a chance to catch their breath between the spookier parts. His characters are mostly fully fleshed out and believable with enough of their own back stories to make them interesting. This is a refreshing change from the cardboard cut outs in so many horror flicks of late.This film is the directorial debut for Yossi Sasson but you would never guess it. He has a natural knack for this kind of work. While many of his contemporaries try to shove in as many film school lighting and camera tricks possible in their freshman opus Sasson remains true to the real impact of the genre, the scare. He has a straightforward style that lets the story unfold on its own without the prodding of the director. He seems to trust that the actors are professional and will give a good representation of the characters in the script. This is a man with style and an eye for framing each scene to near perfection. He also showed his commitment to the film by getting some of the best possible crew members to work on it. The music was scored by Harry Manfredini who did most of the `Friday the 13th' flicks as well as a legion of other horror flicks. He knows of to foster the dark mood with his music. The makeup is great here, far better than the usual Indy horror flick. This is no surprise since they were supervised and produced by Dan Crawley. He has worked on a variety of projects that include the television horror series `Buffy the Vampire Slayer', `Angel', and the recent mainstream thriller `Awake'. He also did special effects for `World Trade Center' and `Apocalypto'.",4,A return to classic horror,1214697600,"06 29, 2008",2008,3114,"['may', 'be', 'first', 'screenplay', 'offered', 'up', 'Harry', 'Shannon', 'man', 'considerable', 'experience', 'horror', 'genre', 'been', 'successful', 'novelist', 'genre', 'many', 'years', 'now', 'books', 'well', 'received', 'critics', 'public', 'man', 'many', 'talents', 'including', 'composing', 'performing', 'music', 'novels', 'cover', 'topics', 'range', 'suspense', 'mystery', 'even', 'werewolf', 'two', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure', 'versatile', 'background', 'film', 'could', 'not', 'do', 'better', 'script', 'department', 'Shannon', 'wrote', 'theme', 'song', 'flick', 'took', 'turn', 'front', 'camera', 'first', 'twist', 'plot', 'having', 'trophy', 'spouse', 'husband', 'couple', 'verge', 'finical', 'ruin', 'comatose', 'wife', 'up', 'remote', 'cabin', 'woods', 'something', 'won', 'poker', 'game', 'Naturally', 'things', 'go', 'stories', 'area', 'bad', 'reputation', 'Awhile', 'back', 'man', 'went', 'crazy', 'cabin', 'killed', 'family', 'isolation', 'wear', 'man', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'real', 'what', 'just', 'overactive', 'imagination', 'one', 'aspect', 'story', 'pack', 'are', 'elements', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'blended', 'audience', 'constantly', 'guessing', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'next', 'Shannon', 'was', 'influenced', 'old', 'EC', 'horror', 'comic', 'infused', 'dark', 'humor', 'stories', 'similar', 'approach', 'here', 'breaking', 'up', 'tension', 'such', 'black', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'impede', 'movement', 'plot', 'just', 'audience', 'little', 'change', 'pace', 'chance', 'catch', 'breath', 'spookier', 'parts', 'characters', 'are', 'mostly', 'fully', 'fleshed', 'out', 'believable', 'enough', 'own', 'back', 'stories', 'make', 'interesting', 'refreshing', 'change', 'cardboard', 'cut', 'outs', 'so', 'many', 'horror', 'flicks', 'late.This', 'film', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Yossi', 'Sasson', 'would', 'never', 'guess', 'natural', 'knack', 'kind', 'work', 'many', 'contemporaries', 'try', 'shove', 'as', 'many', 'film', 'school', 'lighting', 'camera', 'tricks', 'possible', 'freshman', 'Sasson', 'true', 'real', 'impact', 'genre', 'scare', 'straightforward', 'style', 'story', 'unfold', 'own', 'prodding', 'director', 'trust', 'actors', 'are', 'professional', 'will', 'give', 'good', 'representation', 'characters', 'script', 'man', 'style', 'eye', 'framing', 'scene', 'perfection', 'also', 'showed', 'commitment', 'film', 'getting', 'best', 'possible', 'crew', 'members', 'work', 'music', 'was', 'scored', 'Harry', 'Manfredini', 'who', 'did', 'most', 'Friday', '13th', 'flicks', 'as', 'well', 'legion', 'other', 'horror', 'flicks', 'foster', 'dark', 'mood', 'music', 'makeup', 'great', 'here', 'far', 'better', 'usual', 'Indy', 'horror', 'flick', 'surprise', 'were', 'supervised', 'produced', 'Dan', 'Crawley', 'worked', 'variety', 'projects', 'include', 'television', 'horror', 'series', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'Angel', 'recent', 'mainstream', 'thriller', 'Awake', 'also', 'did', 'special', 'effects', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'Apocalypto']",Dead And Gone
1157474,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0017MO0VK,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 1]","Dead and Gone (Yossi Sasson, 2008)NOTE: this review may contain spoilers. (I honestly can't tell you if it does or not, for reasons I will discuss below.) If you haven't seen it and are planning to, I strongly recommend not reading past the plot synopsis.Dead and Gone is a movie I can't really decide how to rate, for reasons that will become obvious. I know it won't be a good rating, because the fact that I even have the big, burning question I do about this movie means that the thing in question was very ineptly handled; first-time writer Harry Shannon (yeah, the country singer) and first-time director Yossi Sasson stumbled all over the place. They put together all the necessary ingredients, but the proportions are off; whether you think it tastes a complete dog's dinner or whether it's just oddly spiced is entirely up to your sense of taste.Jack Wade (Hollyoaks' Quentin Jones) retreats from Hollywood to a cabin in the woods just outside a small town with his comatose wife in order to get away from the paparazzi and gossip-mongers. But all is not well in hickville. First off, he alienates the Rose brothers, Booger (Ben Moody, best known as half of rock band Evanescence) and Moss (Robert Herrick from Speed 2). Then he meets gorgeous local office Kate Edison (Disturbia's Gillian Shure), and the romantic attraction is immediate. Well, your wife's in a coma, what are you gonna do, right? Jack, however, who's something of a failure as an actor, is continually haunted by visions of his wife belittling him, telling him he's no good, augmented by the general creepiness of the local folks; as Booger Rose is fond of saying, ""You only think you're alone up here...."".Okay, so my big problem with the movie (and there are many minor ones, but this is the biggie) is that it seemed to me that the fact that Jake is absolutely [censored for Amazon consumption] nuts from the get-go was supposed to be THE big reveal in the movie. If so, it's a complete and utter failure; that was obvious (to me, anyway) five minutes into the movie. But the movie plays out as if it's supposed to be some sort of big secret (you'd think a local sheriff's deputy wouldn't drop her pants so quick for someone who's ready for a straitjacket, etc.). This is the sort of misstep that can blow an entire movie, and it certainly does here. While there are other missteps--the pacing is off in the beginning (I don't mind slow at all, but it's inconsistently slow), some of the make-up jobs are hilarious, etc.--it's the confusion of the supposed big reveal that really blows this.On the up side, you have a stable of surprisingly experienced actors (though note I do not use the term ""talented"" in most cases) and a professionally-shot flick. There are a bunch of cameos (Harry Shannon pops up as the sheriff, Marilyn Ghiglotti from Clerks, Kyle Gass of Tenacious D, Sleepaway Camp's Felissa Rose, The Dead Zone's Chris Bruno, and a host of others) and some decent acting from the leads, though I warn you that Shure's performance is a love-it-or-hate-it kinda thing judging by the reviews (I thought she was just fine here). Is that enough to carry it for you? Then by all means give it a look. **",2,"Attractive stars, really confusing script.",1285027200,"09 21, 2010",2010,3190,"['Dead', 'Gone', 'Yossi', 'Sasson', '2008', 'NOTE', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'honestly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'not', 'reasons', 'will', 'discuss', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'are', 'planning', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'not', 'reading', 'plot', 'synopsis.Dead', 'Gone', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'decide', 'how', 'rate', 'reasons', 'will', 'become', 'obvious', 'know', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'good', 'rating', 'fact', 'even', 'have', 'big', 'burning', 'question', 'do', 'movie', 'thing', 'question', 'was', 'very', 'ineptly', 'handled', 'first-time', 'writer', 'Harry', 'Shannon', 'yeah', 'country', 'singer', 'first-time', 'director', 'Yossi', 'Sasson', 'stumbled', 'place', 'put', 'together', 'necessary', 'ingredients', 'proportions', 'are', 'think', 'complete', 'dog', 'dinner', 'just', 'oddly', 'spiced', 'entirely', 'sense', 'taste.Jack', 'Wade', 'Hollyoaks', 'Quentin', 'Jones', 'Hollywood', 'cabin', 'woods', 'just', 'small', 'town', 'comatose', 'wife', 'order', 'get', 'away', 'paparazzi', 'gossip-mongers', 'not', 'well', 'hickville', 'First', 'off', 'Rose', 'brothers', 'Booger', 'Ben', 'Moody', 'best', 'known', 'half', 'rock', 'band', 'Evanescence', 'Moss', 'Robert', 'Herrick', 'Speed', '2', 'Then', 'gorgeous', 'local', 'office', 'Kate', 'Edison', 'Disturbia', 'Gillian', 'Shure', 'romantic', 'attraction', 'immediate', 'Well', 'wife', 'coma', 'what', 'are', 'gon', 'do', 'right', 'Jack', 'however', 'who', 'something', 'failure', 'actor', 'continually', 'haunted', 'visions', 'wife', 'belittling', 'telling', 'good', 'augmented', 'general', 'creepiness', 'local', 'folks', 'Booger', 'Rose', 'fond', 'saying', 'only', 'think', ""'re"", 'alone', 'up', 'here', '.Okay', 'big', 'problem', 'movie', 'are', 'many', 'minor', 'ones', 'biggie', 'seemed', 'fact', 'Jake', 'absolutely', '[', 'censored', 'Amazon', 'consumption', ']', 'nuts', 'get-go', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'THE', 'big', 'reveal', 'movie', 'so', 'complete', 'utter', 'failure', 'was', 'obvious', 'anyway', 'five', 'minutes', 'movie', 'movie', 'out', 'supposed', 'be', 'sort', 'big', 'secret', ""'d"", 'think', 'local', 'sheriff', 'deputy', 'would', ""n't"", 'drop', 'pants', 'so', 'quick', 'someone', 'who', 'ready', 'straitjacket', 'etc.', 'sort', 'misstep', 'can', 'blow', 'entire', 'movie', 'certainly', 'here', 'are', 'other', 'missteps', 'pacing', 'beginning', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'slow', 'inconsistently', 'slow', 'make-up', 'jobs', 'are', 'hilarious', 'etc.', 'confusion', 'supposed', 'big', 'reveal', 'really', 'this.On', 'up', 'side', 'have', 'stable', 'surprisingly', 'experienced', 'actors', 'note', 'do', 'not', 'use', 'term', 'talented', 'most', 'cases', 'professionally-shot', 'flick', 'are', 'bunch', 'cameos', 'Harry', 'Shannon', 'up', 'sheriff', 'Marilyn', 'Ghiglotti', 'Clerks', 'Kyle', 'Gass', 'Tenacious', 'D', 'Sleepaway', 'Camp', 'Felissa', 'Rose', 'Dead', 'Zone', 'Chris', 'Bruno', 'host', 'others', 'decent', 'acting', 'leads', 'warn', 'Shure', 'performance', 'love-it-or-hate-it', 'kinda', 'thing', 'judging', 'reviews', 'thought', 'was', 'just', 'fine', 'here', 'enough', 'carry', 'Then', 'means', 'give', 'look', '**']",Dead And Gone
