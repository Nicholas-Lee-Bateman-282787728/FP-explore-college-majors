His love and warmth and identification as Father, a Good Father to all, was unmistakable.For years in Rome, long after the slow decline of what he had prayed for, cab drivers in and around the vatican, and in some of Romas less, shall we say, desirable areas, had post card photos of JOHN XXIII above the visor in their cars.Non Catholics loved him,most everyone except the Neanderthal Right loved him.Now to this film. Ed Asner is superb as Papa Roncalli.The production is pretty good[im guessing italian Tv was the producer?}It is with the tone that I find objectionable. Somehow, the reforms of Vatican II  many which have never seen the light of day, were excesses brought on after John passed away?  The  2 'experts' who are brought on afterwards, Hitchcock and Fr Pacwa are reminiscent of the talking heads on Fox news who redefine what Reagan Bush et al did and make it palatable[well, to them,anyway].

While not an award-winning production, the quality is in Asner's performance and in the life-story of Angelo Roncalli (his given name). The pace is deliberate, as are many foreign productions of this nature, but it will keep the interest of fans of this genre. The mostly Italian cast renders solid performances too.There are 2 options for listening & watching the movie -- Italian with English subtitles and dubbed English (except for Asner's and a few others' lines).

The film captures this beautifully mainly because of Ed Asner's portrayal of the famous pope.

The movie is a fine production and conveys the journey of this unlikely pope who spread his love for his faith and people.

Of course, Mr. Durning was more phyically appropriate for the part, but Ed Asner did a most remarkable job portraying the man who fooled them all!  He was not the interim caretaker he was intended to be, and his daring has changed the Roman Catholic church forever.The only two parts I found confusing and/or annoying were intermitent flashbacks to the young Angelo Roncali and the appearance that most of the dialogue was dubbed.

1186223,A2UITTZE0YDER2,B001EPKKV4,"ServusDei ""udayajmj""","[12, 16]","John the XXIII is a welcome and serious addition to my growing collection of religious movies. The movie is extremely well made and the directors have taken the necessary pains in making it authentic by including real historical clips from the era. Ed Asner as the Good Pope John, bears an uncanny resemblance to the late Pontiff and executes his role with brilliance.The movvie begins at the death of Pius XII. In Venice the necessary preparations are being made for Cardinal Roncalli to attend the conclave. From here we begin a series of flashbacks to the Cardinals childhood in his impoverished town, to his days as a young priest, where he works in different difficult situations in various countries. From there we move on to the happenings of the conclave and his days as Pope.What I have understood is that Pope John XXIII had the best interests of both the Church and the world at heart. That caused him to convene the 2nd Vatican council (something I have long blamed the good Pope for). However after watching tis movie, whatever apprehensions I have had about Papa Roncalli has disappeared. Had he lived longer, I believe he would have stopped 75% of the errors of interpretation that we good catholics have long suffered.In short this movie is filled with wit, humour, piety, heroism and simplicity....all the hall marks of Blessed John XXIII.",5,An excellent Biopic,1228348800,"12 4, 2008",2008,1356,"['John', 'XXIII', 'welcome', 'serious', 'addition', 'growing', 'collection', 'religious', 'movies', 'movie', 'extremely', 'well', 'made', 'directors', 'have', 'taken', 'necessary', 'pains', 'making', 'authentic', 'including', 'real', 'historical', 'clips', 'era', 'Ed', 'Asner', 'Good', 'Pope', 'John', 'uncanny', 'resemblance', 'late', 'Pontiff', 'role', 'brilliance.The', 'movvie', 'death', 'Pius', 'XII', 'Venice', 'necessary', 'preparations', 'are', 'being', 'made', 'Cardinal', 'Roncalli', 'attend', 'conclave', 'here', 'begin', 'series', 'flashbacks', 'Cardinals', 'childhood', 'impoverished', 'town', 'days', 'young', 'priest', 'where', 'different', 'difficult', 'situations', 'various', 'countries', 'move', 'happenings', 'conclave', 'days', 'Pope.What', 'have', 'understood', 'Pope', 'John', 'XXIII', 'had', 'best', 'interests', 'Church', 'world', 'heart', 'caused', 'convene', '2nd', 'Vatican', 'council', 'something', 'have', 'long', 'blamed', 'good', 'Pope', 'However', 'watching', 'tis', 'movie', 'apprehensions', 'have', 'had', 'Papa', 'Roncalli', 'disappeared', 'Had', 'lived', 'longer', 'believe', 'would', 'have', 'stopped', '75', '%', 'errors', 'interpretation', 'good', 'catholics', 'have', 'long', 'suffered.In', 'short', 'movie', 'filled', 'wit', 'humour', 'piety', 'heroism', 'simplicity', 'hall', 'marks', 'Blessed', 'John', 'XXIII']",John XXIII
1186224,ATB8MP2M9L5PM,B001EPKKV4,"Transcendental Thomist ""jeb815""","[2, 2]","Going into this film I had already seen several of these Italian-international papal biography miniseries epics: ""Pius XII: Under the Roman Sky,"" ""Paul VI: The Pope in the Tempest,"" ""John Paul I: The Smile of God,"" and ""Pope John Paul II."" So you might say I had ""pope movie fatigue."" One of these films (""Pope John Paul II"" with Jon Voight, produced after his death for CBS television at Christmas 2005) is Emmy-nominated and brilliant. The others are mixed bags, sometimes stirring and often hokey, featuring subtitled or badly dubbed Italian actors in heavily fictionalized portrayals of the titular popes turning them into boring plaster saints. All are richly produced. So when I turned on ""John XXIII: The Pope of Peace"" with Ed Asner, I did not have high expectations, and the poor English dubbing of the first actors who appear in the film is somewhat distracting. But I was shocked to find myself increasingly involved with and entertained by this 3-hour miniseries as it went along. That's because it features a poignant and sensitive lead performance by (Jewish) actor Ed Asner as the titular pope, avoiding most pitfalls of the genre like pseudo-mystical foreshadowing and dumb fictionalized subplots of pope-worship.The movie begins with the 1958 death of Pius XII and Cardinal Angelo Roncalli, patriarch of Venice, traveling to Rome for the conclave that will elect him pope under the name of John XXIII. Rather than giving us an extended and possibly dull flashback to Roncalli's youth, we get a series of short flashbacks as Roncalli and other characters recall his background at the conclave. These swift flashback scenes, despite bad English dubbing that includes the young actor playing Roncalli, do a great job showing the future pope's character and impoverished background without lingering over unnecessary subplots like most of the films in this genre. In fact, this entire movie (including the second half centering on Roncalli's five-year papacy culminating in the Second Vatican Council) is delightfully free of the stupid fictional characters and ""prophecy"" scenes that litter the other RAI-Lux Vide papal films in this genre. Even better, Asner is a revelation as John XXIII, nailing the pope's humility and common touch as the ""people's pope"" in a satisfying way. Despite speaking in a plain American accent, rather than attempting an Italian patois ala Jon Voight's Polish accent in ""Pope John Paul II,"" Asner overcomes the minor distraction of his voice through spot-on mannerisms and acting touches that make it feel like he is really John XXIII.Fortunately, the DVD also includes an Italian language track (with English subtitles) that is far superior to the English language track, allowing one to hear all of the actors (except Asner, who is dubbed) in their original voices rather than in the distracting English dubbing. Ironically, it appears that only Asner was speaking English during filming, as all of the other actors are Europeans whose lips and voices decisively match the Italian track. So the English track features only Asner in his own voice, while the Italian track features all of the players except him in their own voices, but the Italian dubbing of Asner masterfully matches his lip movements and is far less distracting than the English track. This choice between tracks is an odd one to have on a DVD, but is much appreciated over a disc that would only give us the poor English dubbing.In any event, as a film produced before Pope Francis decided to canonize John XXIII along with John Paul II as saints in spring 2014, this movie is particularly topical for Catholics today. I have not seen ""The Good Pope"" with Bob Hoskins as John XXIII, mainly because it is not available on DVD in the United States, but this film is pretty good as a straightforward biography of the 20th century pope who had the biggest impact in the shortest time. As the title suggests, it emphasizes his focus on peace (remember the encyclical Pacem in Terris?) as the greatest remedy to the world's woes in a war-torn century that was the most destructive in human history, but it also covers Vatican II in a satisfying way. Although the second half becomes a bit talky as it focuses on the papacy and forgets the flashbacks, there is a compelling dramatic tension between Cardinal Ottaviani (the Holy Office head who opposed calling Vatican II) and John XXIII whom he is attempting to manipulate as a ""transitional pope,"" providing some good emotional payoffs. This miniseries really gives you a strong sense of the man who, together with John Paul II, is currently one of just 2 popes in the 20th century to be be declared saint.",5,Shockingly good biopic of the pope who launched Vatican II,1387929600,"12 25, 2013",2013,4665,"['Going', 'film', 'had', 'already', 'seen', 'several', 'Italian-international', 'papal', 'biography', 'miniseries', 'epics', 'Pius', 'XII', 'Roman', 'Sky', 'Paul', 'VI', 'Pope', 'Tempest', 'John', 'Paul', 'Smile', 'God', 'Pope', 'John', 'Paul', 'II', 'might', 'say', 'had', 'pope', 'movie', 'fatigue', 'One', 'films', 'Pope', 'John', 'Paul', 'II', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'produced', 'death', 'CBS', 'television', 'Christmas', '2005', 'Emmy-nominated', 'brilliant', 'others', 'are', 'mixed', 'bags', 'sometimes', 'stirring', 'often', 'hokey', 'featuring', 'subtitled', 'badly', 'dubbed', 'Italian', 'actors', 'heavily', 'fictionalized', 'portrayals', 'titular', 'popes', 'turning', 'boring', 'plaster', 'saints', 'are', 'richly', 'produced', 'when', 'turned', 'John', 'XXIII', 'Pope', 'Peace', 'Ed', 'Asner', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'high', 'expectations', 'poor', 'English', 'dubbing', 'first', 'actors', 'who', 'appear', 'film', 'somewhat', 'distracting', 'was', 'shocked', 'find', 'increasingly', 'involved', 'entertained', '3-hour', 'miniseries', 'went', 'along', 'poignant', 'sensitive', 'lead', 'performance', 'Jewish', 'actor', 'Ed', 'Asner', 'titular', 'pope', 'avoiding', 'most', 'pitfalls', 'genre', 'pseudo-mystical', 'foreshadowing', 'dumb', 'fictionalized', 'subplots', 'pope-worship.The', 'movie', '1958', 'death', 'Pius', 'XII', 'Cardinal', 'Angelo', 'Roncalli', 'patriarch', 'Venice', 'traveling', 'Rome', 'conclave', 'will', 'elect', 'pope', 'name', 'John', 'XXIII', 'Rather', 'giving', 'extended', 'possibly', 'dull', 'flashback', 'Roncalli', 'youth', 'get', 'series', 'short', 'flashbacks', 'Roncalli', 'other', 'characters', 'recall', 'background', 'conclave', 'swift', 'flashback', 'scenes', 'bad', 'English', 'dubbing', 'young', 'actor', 'playing', 'Roncalli', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'showing', 'future', 'pope', 'character', 'impoverished', 'background', 'lingering', 'over', 'unnecessary', 'subplots', 'most', 'films', 'genre', 'fact', 'entire', 'movie', 'including', 'second', 'half', 'centering', 'Roncalli', 'five-year', 'papacy', 'culminating', 'Second', 'Vatican', 'Council', 'delightfully', 'free', 'stupid', 'fictional', 'characters', 'prophecy', 'scenes', 'litter', 'other', 'RAI-Lux', 'Vide', 'papal', 'films', 'genre', 'Even', 'better', 'Asner', 'revelation', 'John', 'XXIII', 'nailing', 'pope', 'humility', 'common', 'touch', 'people', 'pope', 'satisfying', 'way', 'speaking', 'plain', 'American', 'accent', 'rather', 'attempting', 'Italian', 'patois', 'ala', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'Polish', 'accent', 'Pope', 'John', 'Paul', 'II', 'Asner', 'minor', 'distraction', 'voice', 'spot-on', 'mannerisms', 'acting', 'touches', 'make', 'feel', 'really', 'John', 'XXIII.Fortunately', 'DVD', 'also', 'Italian', 'language', 'track', 'English', 'subtitles', 'far', 'superior', 'English', 'language', 'track', 'allowing', 'one', 'hear', 'actors', 'Asner', 'who', 'dubbed', 'original', 'voices', 'rather', 'distracting', 'English', 'dubbing', 'Ironically', 'only', 'Asner', 'was', 'speaking', 'English', 'filming', 'other', 'actors', 'are', 'Europeans', 'lips', 'voices', 'decisively', 'match', 'Italian', 'track', 'English', 'track', 'only', 'Asner', 'own', 'voice', 'Italian', 'track', 'players', 'own', 'voices', 'Italian', 'dubbing', 'Asner', 'masterfully', 'lip', 'movements', 'far', 'less', 'distracting', 'English', 'track', 'choice', 'tracks', 'odd', 'one', 'have', 'DVD', 'much', 'appreciated', 'disc', 'would', 'only', 'give', 'poor', 'English', 'dubbing.In', 'event', 'film', 'produced', 'Pope', 'Francis', 'decided', 'canonize', 'John', 'XXIII', 'John', 'Paul', 'II', 'saints', 'spring', '2014', 'movie', 'particularly', 'topical', 'Catholics', 'today', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'Good', 'Pope', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'John', 'XXIII', 'mainly', 'not', 'available', 'DVD', 'United', 'States', 'film', 'pretty', 'good', 'straightforward', 'biography', '20th', 'century', 'pope', 'who', 'had', 'biggest', 'impact', 'shortest', 'time', 'title', 'focus', 'peace', 'remember', 'encyclical', 'Pacem', 'Terris', 'greatest', 'remedy', 'world', 'woes', 'war-torn', 'century', 'was', 'most', 'destructive', 'human', 'history', 'also', 'Vatican', 'II', 'satisfying', 'way', 'second', 'half', 'bit', 'talky', 'papacy', 'flashbacks', 'compelling', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'Cardinal', 'Ottaviani', 'Holy', 'Office', 'head', 'who', 'opposed', 'calling', 'Vatican', 'II', 'John', 'XXIII', 'whom', 'attempting', 'manipulate', 'transitional', 'pope', 'providing', 'good', 'emotional', 'payoffs', 'really', 'strong', 'sense', 'man', 'who', 'together', 'John', 'Paul', 'II', 'currently', 'one', 'just', '2', 'popes', '20th', 'century', 'be', 'be', 'declared', 'saint']",John XXIII
