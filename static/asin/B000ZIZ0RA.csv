1122384,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B000ZIZ0RA,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[7, 9]","Just like `Shakespeare in Love' before it and more recently with `Moliere,' `Becoming Jane' speculates on real life persons and events that explain the inspiration of hallmark British author, Jane Austin.  More true and less mirthful than the other two movies, this film is handsome and engaging from start to finish.Able to become that Jane is Anne Hathaway, who certainly is less tart and assertive than Keira Knightly who perennial plays characters from her novels.  Very human in import, she borrows those mannerisms she perfected in `Brokeback Mountain' to good effect here.  For subtlety is needed for the brilliant wordsmith who needed her novels as a  vicarious method to live out the romantic elements she only partly afforded in her own life.  As we read volumes written on her face, we see her absorb her source material as her own love interest seems to slip from her fingers.Her most potential suitor is an Irish pugilist, Tom Lefroy, played with skill by James McAvoy (who in a subjective way may be suffering from overexposure as the leading romantic man, but has shown an acting repertoire that has been impressive since the `Narnia' days, playing an enchanting and vulnerable Mr. Tumnus, and an equally vulnerable, but more nuanced protagonist, Nicholas, in `The Last King of Scotland').  Despite that minor objection, he plays the leading romantic man assertively, even if we've seen that suit so often recently with the likes of `Atonement' and `Starter for Ten'. With supporting performances by James Chromwell, Maggie Smith, and Julie Walters, the tension of her dilemma is properly delivered and the chemistry is measurable indeed.Here Jane lives precariously.  She is in danger of losing her priority, which is love.  As was common in her time, her chosen suitor was of little interest to her, but of great practical import for her family.  ""Affection is desirable, but money is absolutely indispensible,"" Mrs. Austen (Julie Walters) asserts.  It seems that between the limitations of her love interest and the covetousness of her suitor, she historically will take her pen to live out the romantic interests of others.  With her pen, she obtained the autonomy that few of her peers attained.  Her loss has been our gain.`Becoming Jane' is an absorbing account that has enough historical evidence (albeit her letters) to back it up.  If you love movies with similar subject matter, then this one quickly gets your interest and keeps it going until the last frame.",4,Sweet Resignation,1206316800,"03 24, 2008",2008,2486,"['Just', 'Shakespeare', 'Love', 'more', 'recently', 'Moliere', 'Becoming', 'Jane', 'speculates', 'real', 'life', 'persons', 'events', 'explain', 'inspiration', 'hallmark', 'British', 'author', 'Jane', 'Austin', 'More', 'true', 'less', 'mirthful', 'other', 'two', 'movies', 'film', 'handsome', 'engaging', 'start', 'finish.Able', 'become', 'Jane', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'who', 'certainly', 'less', 'tart', 'assertive', 'Keira', 'Knightly', 'who', 'perennial', 'plays', 'characters', 'novels', 'Very', 'human', 'import', 'mannerisms', 'perfected', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'good', 'effect', 'here', 'subtlety', 'needed', 'brilliant', 'wordsmith', 'who', 'needed', 'novels', 'vicarious', 'method', 'live', 'out', 'romantic', 'elements', 'only', 'partly', 'afforded', 'own', 'life', 'read', 'volumes', 'written', 'face', 'see', 'absorb', 'source', 'material', 'own', 'love', 'interest', 'slip', 'fingers.Her', 'most', 'potential', 'suitor', 'Irish', 'pugilist', 'Tom', 'Lefroy', 'played', 'skill', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'who', 'subjective', 'way', 'may', 'be', 'suffering', 'overexposure', 'leading', 'romantic', 'man', 'shown', 'acting', 'repertoire', 'been', 'impressive', 'Narnia', 'days', 'playing', 'enchanting', 'vulnerable', 'Mr.', 'Tumnus', 'equally', 'vulnerable', 'more', 'nuanced', 'protagonist', 'Nicholas', 'Last', 'King', 'Scotland', 'minor', 'objection', 'leading', 'romantic', 'man', 'assertively', 'even', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'suit', 'so', 'often', 'recently', 'likes', 'Atonement', 'Starter', 'Ten', 'supporting', 'performances', 'James', 'Chromwell', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'Julie', 'Walters', 'tension', 'dilemma', 'properly', 'delivered', 'chemistry', 'measurable', 'indeed.Here', 'Jane', 'precariously', 'danger', 'losing', 'priority', 'love', 'was', 'common', 'time', 'chosen', 'suitor', 'was', 'little', 'interest', 'great', 'practical', 'import', 'family', 'Affection', 'desirable', 'money', 'absolutely', 'indispensible', 'Mrs.', 'Austen', 'Julie', 'Walters', 'limitations', 'love', 'interest', 'covetousness', 'suitor', 'historically', 'will', 'take', 'pen', 'live', 'out', 'romantic', 'interests', 'others', 'pen', 'obtained', 'autonomy', 'few', 'peers', 'attained', 'loss', 'been', 'gain.', 'Becoming', 'Jane', 'absorbing', 'account', 'enough', 'historical', 'evidence', 'letters', 'back', 'up', 'love', 'movies', 'similar', 'subject', 'matter', 'then', 'one', 'quickly', 'interest', 'going', 'last', 'frame']",N/A

I note that this is the case with the story line here as well. I also noted in ""Ms. Potter"" that I was not sure how faithfully the creators of that film were to the biography of Ms. Potter's life, however, for my purpose that it was neither here nor there. That is also the case here, as the creative work of Ms. Jane Austen needs no real defense.  She had an almost unerring novelistic sense of the vices and virtues of the English gentry of the early 19th century. On its own terms this is a very appealing story line of an artist struggling to create work, a double struggle in the case of women in the early 19th century (and since then, as well), to have a creative life as well as social and personal life despite very heavy pressure to conform to the norms of bourgeois British society- meaning marriage and children.

West ""HDTVOCD""","[3, 5]","Now I understand this may not be a general audience type film but damn if this was one of the best Blu-Ray's I've seen and heard. The story of Jane Austen becoming Jane Austen the Author - done by the BBC and an Irish Film Studio.Simply a visual piece of Art IMO in sight and sound and perfect Blu-Ray material for HT Size HD panels where the visuals that were such you could seemingly reach out and touch the scenes and the realistic period piece that was exceptional as was the sound and music to support it. Keep in mind the movie starts out a bit drab in the opening sequences though the level of details is striking in that drabness but there is a purpose behind it later when you find without proper matches between sons and daughters there's next to no money - it seems that everyone in the class society is beholden to someone else and women were pretty much chattel. As the movie progresses the class differences are clearly observed - something done in this movie better than any I've seen in presenting these factors.In a day of Special Effects redundancy that can make you yawn at times this piece stood out to examine a mirror into the life of a masterful novelist and the struggles of the facts of those times where women were chattel and how matches between the sexes were bartered and an independent woman amidst the reality of the times we can take for granted today. I'm not normally an Art's film person and rented it for the wife who is but I found this one of the best overall Blu-Rays I've seen and heard since Black Book another Sleeper.I disagree with the other posting that found it depressing - it's the story of what life was and presented wonderfully visually and the sound system for anyone with a high end HT System. Would anyone really expect the foundation behind her novels and the period in history to deny it's own period reality? Knowing the end result of her novels would anyone expect it to run the course of a Walt Disney script? I enjoyed it very much and got no sense of depression understanding the authors roots beforehand. ;)Not for everyone I understand but it was stunning on my 57"" Sharp LCD and the wife even commented in the walk scenes through the forest it was as if you could get up and walk into the damn scene it was so much that peering into the window effect and the story line presentation was refreshing compared to the run of the mill movies of late that seem to come out of a revolving file cabinet.

1122390,A2RIAXGSBP65BJ,B000ZIZ0RA,"Amanda Hamm ""writer""","[4, 7]","Becoming Jane was pretty much what I expected.  Unfortunately, my expectations were not that high.  It definitely had some fun moments and some romantic moments, both essential to anything labeled with Miss Austen's name.  But overall, this was a movie that just tried too hard.  They forced quotes and snippets from Jane Austen's books into the movie in ways that seemed unnatural and most came from Pride and Prejudice.  Jane Austen wrote six equally splendid novels (plus some other works).  This drama would have you believe that only the one that has become the most well known was inspired by real events and people.  How convenient is that?The love story was also the weakest part of the script.  Mr. Lefroy was clearly intended to be a real life Mr. Darcy.  But while Mr. Darcy only seemed rude in the beginning, Mr. Lefroy actually was rude (among other things).  There is a huge difference and it left me completely unable to root for the romance.  Jane was also courted by the wealthy man who was described as very dull, but who uttered some of the more Austen-like dialogue in the movie.I felt the movie was likable, but not lovable.  I'd suggest renting it as it's probably not something you'll want to watch over and over.  And the bonus features on the DVD didn't seem like much.  I admit I only watched the deleted scenes, but most of them were unfinished and would obviously have slowed down the movie.

1122395,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000ZIZ0RA,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 4]","After the success of Joe Wright's magnificent `Pride & Prejudice' I decided to give `Becoming Jane' a try.  It stars the beautifully talented Anne Hathaway (I predict an Oscar nomination in the near future for this one) as well as the up and coming British import James McAvoy (another future Oscar nominee I presume), not to mention the likes of James Cromwell and Maggie Smith so I was sure the acting would at least be top notch, and it was.  It's not the acting I had a problem with.  The story progression was lagging a bit and it made it hard to really invest myself in what was going on.  It really wasn't until the final twenty minutes or so that my interest was perked and I cared to follow along.`Becoming Jane' tells the story of Jane Austen, famed author and inspirational source for the majority of Hollywood's glorious period epics.  Her life played out much like her novels just with a far less happy ending.  Her family is not well off but her parents are in love and so Jane has adopted the idea that it is better to be poor and content then be wealthy and empty; ideas that I can rally behind and applaud.  This presents a problem when the wealthy Mr. Wisley makes his advances known towards Jane.  She is obviously not interested but her parents are adamant that she accept his proposal.  Jane has become smitten with another though, a poorer soul by the name of Tom.  Tom, much like the love interests in many of Jane's novels, initially gives Jane nothing by irritation but after a time she falls for him in the most sincere of ways.  His Uncle does not approve of his relationship with a girl of her little means and her big dreams and so he forbids the affair before it can truly flourish.The first two thirds of the film seem to drag a bit.  They are polished and beautiful to watch but lack the charm and spunk that was brought to Joe Wright's `Pride & Prejudice'.  Knightley has a sense of unbridled girlishness that permeates her grace and elegance that young Hathaway did not bring to her performance.  She delivers a fine performance in it of itself but she fails to really elevate her material.  McAvoy delivers a fine performance as well, and truly steals each and every scene he is in.  He is by far the best reason to see this film.The final frames of the movie are far superior to everything leading up to it.  It's filled with genuine emotion and sincerity that touches the heart and is moving.  Jane's life was unlike her novels only in their endings and I think that's why the ending of this film is so much better than its beginning and middle; it's different.  Everything leading up to it plays out like snippets from her best work.  We've seen it all before and we've seen it done better so it comes off rather dull and uninspired.  The ending though is nothing like the ending of her novels and thus plays out as new and fresh and unexpected.The cinematography is just as beautiful as it's ever been (although this is yet another area in which Wright's `Pride & Prejudice' surpasses this film) and the attention to period detail, from the scenery to the costumes to the buildings, is all astounding.

And if you're looking for the type of ending Miss Austen wrote for the heroines in her novels, be on your guard.I already knew this going into it, since I've seen several biographies on Jane (search ""The Real Jane Austen"" by the BBC).But you'll likely enjoy the movie if you like the following:1. Costume/Period Drama's (particularly the Regency era)2. Anne Hathaway (Princess Diaries 1 & 2, Ella Enchanted, Devil Wears Prada, etc.)3. James McAvoy  (*small role* Lorna Doone, Penelope, Atonement, etc. )It's a fact that Miss Austen did have some sort of a romantic interest in ""Tom"" Lefroy - an up and coming barrister.  To what extent it's not really known, since Jane instructed her sister Cassandra to destroy the majority of her letters containing his mention after her death.This movie speculates that it was more than just a crush on either end.  And it uses little bits and pieces of info, to connect the dots.Another thing that might irk fans, is that one of the movies main motto's is that their romance is ""what inspired her novels"".  The thing is, Jane had been turning out small masterpieces for her family since she was around 12 (search ""Jane Austen juvenilia"").  So it's not as if she got some harebrained idea to write after she met Tom!POSSIBLE MOVIE SPOILERS:Also, the writer(s) inject bits of her novels into the storyline & characters (maybe a little too much).  Now, it's not a far stretch of the imagination to say that she could have gotten idea's from the people in her actual life, and turned them into her fictional characters. But it's no-brainer which of the films characters are JA's novel counterparts.The thing that may most be confusing to viewers is that ""Mr. Wisley"" (who is their version of Harris Bigg-Wither), and ""Lady Gresham"" (""Wisley's"" aunt- who is obviously the mirror immage of ""Lady Catherine DeBourgh""/Mr. Darcy's aunt in P&P;), only serve to further the plot.In actuality, Mr. Bigg-Wither did indeed propose to Jane, but not during the time this movie was supposed to take place (in Dec. 1795- Jan. 1796)!_______I feel that overall Anne was a worthy choice for Miss Austen.  Not only does she look the part, but her method acting is brilliant!  To try and best emulate the accent she moved there a month beforehand.  She also took the time to learn the piano for just 2 small scenes.  And even surpassed the writing teacher to bring Miss Austen's famous words to life!This was only the 2nd movie I had seen James McAvoy in (the first was only a small role); so I had little to base his acting on.  But, in this particular movie, I think he establishes himself fit as a leading man, and has quite an emotional depth about him!The majority of the cast are also equally suited.  Anna Maxwell Martin (Cassandra) is a very talented actress whom I've especially enjoyed in other period productions (specifically the BBC's ""North & South"", and ""Bleak House"" miniseries).The cinematography is gorgeous (despite it being shot in Ireland, and not England).  And the soundtrack very complimentary!In conclusion, while the film may not be a totally accurate biography; I felt it nicely embodies Jane Austen as a person.  I'm certainly glad I chose to add it to my collection of period drama's!If you're interested in seeing more of Jane Austen captured on film (particularly her later years), you may also enjoy ""Miss Austen Regrets"".",4,Great Period Film!

1122399,A2U549OUP6XJ1B,B000ZIZ0RA,"April79marie ""April79marie""","[0, 0]","The story is about the early years of Jane Austen, as a young writer. It deals with her meeting of Tom Lefroy, a dashing, young, Irishman who might have inspired her in her writting.I am a great fan of Jane Austen but as her life remains very much a mystery, I was curious to see this movie. Surprisingly, I enjoyed it very much. I have seen it three times now and it is still a pleasure. I might add that the more I see it, the more I love it.So what if this story doesn't really correspond to the life that Jane Austen might have had, or that some parts of the story are probably ficticious, this story is still very believable and it pleases me to imagine that she might have been in love and that this love might have been a great source of inspiration.I had one fear about this movie: I thought -wrongly now-that it would be a remake of Jane Austen's story Pride & Prejudice. I was relieved to see that it was not the case in the end. Tom Lefroy, the man Jane falls in love with, is not at all like Darcy. Some characters in the movie might have inspired Jane Austen, there are some references here and there to Jane Austen's novels and the fans won't miss them but I think these references are a kind of tribute to Jane Austen and her work. I appreciate that.Moreover, what I ask of a period drama movie is to take me to another place, in another time and on this account, 'Becoming Jane' achieves that very well. The balls are a delight, the dances are beautiful and very well-shot, you almost have the illusion of seeing an 18th/19th century England. This Jane is young, witty and rather spirited for her time but she also has to respect the conventions of the English society and the issues concerning ranks, money and women's writing are dealt with in the movie. This is also a kind of tribute to her writing and to the feminine writing.The cast is perfect. All the actors give a good performance, even Anne Hathaway. You can still hear some of her American accent sometimes but she fits the part very well for me. She brings charm and some freshness to the heroine. She has some good chemistry with McAvoy who is, I must confess, absolutely breathtaking! He even almost steals the show with his amazing performance. His character, Tom Lefroy is irresistible and I can totally understand why Jane falls in love with him. Wow! The library scene is probably one of my favourite scenes, after the dancing scene at Lady Gresham's ball, in which Tom and Jane start falling in love. Ah, and this scene with the beautiful music behind is really breathtaking! The looks between the two actors as they are dancing are so extraordinary that you can really sense that they are indeed falling in love. This moment is pure magic!The cast is superb, Maggie Smith (Lady Gresham), Julie Walters (Mrs Austen), great Anna Maxwell Martin as Cassandra (seen as Bessie in North &South;), Laurence Fox, Joe Anderson (Henry).The music is enchanting with a touch of 'baroque' style for the dances. The way the movie is directed might be a little simple and academic but honestly this is a good period drama movie. For those who don't know Jane Austen, this movie will urge you to read her novels, I am sure. For those who are already great fans, you may or you may not like this movie. It depends on how you imagine Jane Austen's life. Would Jane Austen have eloped with the man she loved? We may seriously doubt that, considering that elopement is very much condemned in her novels, but then after all, we are 'all fools in love', why would Jane be different on the impulse of the moment?Beautiful!",5,It is a wonderful tribute to Jane Austen!,1194739200,"11 11, 2007",2007,3585,"['story', 'early', 'years', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'young', 'writer', 'meeting', 'Tom', 'Lefroy', 'dashing', 'young', 'Irishman', 'who', 'might', 'have', 'inspired', 'writting.I', 'am', 'great', 'fan', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'life', 'very', 'much', 'mystery', 'was', 'curious', 'see', 'movie', 'Surprisingly', 'enjoyed', 'very', 'much', 'have', 'seen', 'three', 'times', 'now', 'still', 'pleasure', 'might', 'add', 'more', 'see', 'more', 'love', 'it.So', 'what', 'story', ""n't"", 'really', 'correspond', 'life', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'parts', 'story', 'are', 'probably', 'ficticious', 'story', 'still', 'very', 'believable', 'imagine', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'love', 'love', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'source', 'inspiration.I', 'had', 'one', 'fear', 'movie', 'thought', '-wrongly', 'now-that', 'would', 'be', 'remake', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'story', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'was', 'relieved', 'see', 'was', 'not', 'case', 'end', 'Tom', 'Lefroy', 'man', 'Jane', 'love', 'not', 'like', 'Darcy', 'characters', 'movie', 'might', 'have', 'inspired', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'are', 'references', 'here', 'there', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'novels', 'fans', 'wo', ""n't"", 'miss', 'think', 'references', 'are', 'kind', 'tribute', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'work', 'appreciate', 'that.Moreover', 'what', 'ask', 'period', 'drama', 'movie', 'take', 'place', 'time', 'account', ""'Becoming"", 'Jane', 'achieves', 'very', 'well', 'balls', 'are', 'delight', 'dances', 'are', 'beautiful', 'very', 'well-shot', 'almost', 'have', 'illusion', 'seeing', '18th/19th', 'century', 'England', 'Jane', 'young', 'witty', 'rather', 'spirited', 'time', 'also', 'respect', 'conventions', 'English', 'society', 'issues', 'concerning', 'ranks', 'money', 'women', 'writing', 'are', 'dealt', 'movie', 'also', 'kind', 'tribute', 'writing', 'feminine', 'writing.The', 'cast', 'perfect', 'actors', 'give', 'good', 'performance', 'even', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'can', 'still', 'hear', 'American', 'accent', 'sometimes', 'part', 'very', 'well', 'charm', 'freshness', 'heroine', 'good', 'chemistry', 'McAvoy', 'who', 'must', 'confess', 'absolutely', 'breathtaking', 'even', 'almost', 'show', 'amazing', 'performance', 'character', 'Tom', 'Lefroy', 'irresistible', 'can', 'totally', 'understand', 'why', 'Jane', 'love', 'Wow', 'library', 'scene', 'probably', 'one', 'favourite', 'scenes', 'dancing', 'scene', 'Lady', 'Gresham', 'ball', 'Tom', 'Jane', 'start', 'falling', 'love', 'Ah', 'scene', 'beautiful', 'music', 'behind', 'really', 'breathtaking', 'looks', 'two', 'actors', 'are', 'dancing', 'are', 'so', 'extraordinary', 'can', 'really', 'sense', 'are', 'indeed', 'falling', 'love', 'moment', 'pure', 'magic', 'cast', 'superb', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'Lady', 'Gresham', 'Julie', 'Walters', 'Mrs', 'Austen', 'great', 'Anna', 'Maxwell', 'Martin', 'Cassandra', 'seen', 'Bessie', 'North', 'South', 'Laurence', 'Fox', 'Joe', 'Anderson', 'Henry', '.The', 'music', 'enchanting', 'touch', ""'baroque"", 'style', 'dances', 'way', 'movie', 'directed', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'simple', 'academic', 'honestly', 'good', 'period', 'drama', 'movie', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'movie', 'will', 'urge', 'read', 'novels', 'am', 'sure', 'who', 'are', 'already', 'great', 'fans', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'like', 'movie', 'how', 'imagine', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'life', 'Would', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'have', 'eloped', 'man', 'loved', 'may', 'seriously', 'doubt', 'considering', 'elopement', 'very', 'much', 'condemned', 'novels', 'then', 'are', ""'all"", 'fools', 'love', 'why', 'would', 'Jane', 'be', 'different', 'impulse', 'moment', 'Beautiful']",N/A

This one intrigued me because it's the first Austen biopic I can recall. I enjoyed it, but it does tend to engage in a lot of speculative fantasizing about Austen's life and loves. However, if you're willing to take it as an ""Austen-inspired"" romance, I think it's entertaining.For me James McAvoy's performance is really what drives this movie and makes it worth watching. His performance is assured, charming, boyish, sexy, and intelligent. The other enjoyable feature of the movie is all of the reliable English actors that populate the film in secondary roles. Maggie Smith and the late Ian Richardson turn in their usual impeccable performances.For me the disappointment in this movie is Anne Hathaway's (a) casting, and (b) performance. While her chemistry with McAvoy was undeniable, ultimately there was just no way I felt the girl on the screen was capable of brilliance...something essential for anyone playing Austen. (In fairness, that's partly a fault of the script.) Hathaway's English accent is passable most of the time, but there were times she was so soft spoken, I had to turn the volume way up to hear her.

As far as I can tell, it's not literally a biography because much of the story line is speculation, filling in the blanks from the known biographical data and maybe making a wee bit more romantic than the facts allow. But Jane Austin was a romantic herself, so that's only fair.You will recognize elements from several Austin novels, but how much of that is known facts and how much the filling in is anyone's guess. Or perhaps a serious Austin scholar would know. I'm just a fan, not a scholar. The outline is simple enough: Jane is from a family of modest means. Her father is a clergyman, and they have enough children that while they are not literally poor, they don't have much. And of course, to such a mother, marrying off her girls to gentry is close to an obsession, not merely a wish. The local snob (Maggie Smith) has condescendingly consented to her nephew and heir asking for Jane's hand in marriage. But in the meantime, she has fallen for Lefroy, an Irish lawyer completely dependent on his wealthy judge uncle.So, we know Jane did not marry for money, but did Lefroy? And if so, how could he give up his love for Jane to do so? The answers to those questions are too charmingly told in the movie for me to want to spoil it for you.It's a pretty movie, as well as an interesting story well told.",3,"Sweet.

Without exception, all of her films have been turned into films. From her lesser knownNorthanger AbbeyandPersuasionto her more popularSense & Sensibilityand, the crown jewel,Pride and Prejudice. Her characters' romances have inspired writers and made women swoon. But where did Jane get her inspiration?BECOMING JANE tells us--in no uncertain terms--that life frequently imitates art. We're shown, however, that Jane's choices were often in direct opposition to her writings. Jane never married, had only one true love, and was shunned by the literary community of the times because of her sex (women who wrote fiction were often considered scandalous).Connections between her stories and her real life are shoved down the viewers' throats, making true discovery by the movie-watcher impossible (""Oh look. That must be where she got the idea for Mr. Darcy."" And, ""Oh look. That must be where she got the idea forEmma."") The list is long and exceptionally easy. The complexity of her stories didn't match the simplicity of Becoming Jane's screenplay is what I'm saying.The relationship between Jane (Anne Hathaway,The Devil Wears Prada) and her one true love Tom (James McAvoy,Atonement) is well played but leaves little doubt about where Ms. Austen came up with her Darcy personae. The ending made this an easier pill to swallow, which also raised my rating of the film (it is in keeping with the times that Ms. Austen grew up and the restrictions placed on those people of money and property, and those without).This film also points to a sad end for Ian Richardson, who died soon after the film's completion. Richardson plays Judge Langlois who lords over Tom as his uncle (Richardson is known for his amazing TV repertoire ...fromBleak HousetoSherlock Holmes - The Hound of the Baskervilles) Tom (McAvoy) is Judge Langlois' heir apparent, and is forced to do the unthinkable when given the choice between love or money (or family abroad). In true sacrificial fashion, Jane refuses him his sacrifice and, in the end, chooses the life of an unwedded old maid. But she has her writings, and uses them to insert herself into a life she should have lived (living vicariously through her characters).No doubt Becoming Jane was also Hollywoodized, making Jane's life seem more interesting than it was. Liberties with film will always be taken, though. It just depends on how much that irks you as the viewer. For someone as important to literature as Ms. Austen, it might be more irksome than entertaining.",3,Life Doesn't Always Imitate Art.

Both pictures stand on their own as a witty,  literate and  straightforward narrative, both are appreciated by the knowledgeable fan for all the little throwaway bits drawn from the respective authors works and days, and both are well worth a second (or even third or fourth viewing).  Whereas Shakespeare had something like 38 plays, several hundred sonnets and two long poems to his credit - a wealth of literary raw materiel to work with, the doings of kings and warriors and great matters of state, Jane Austin's reputation rests on six novels as perfectly constricted as jeweled Faberge Easter eggs. ""Becoming Jane"" very cleverly draws on elements, characters and situations from each of them in constructing a charming and speculative romance.What if Jane, the engaging and witty writer, the sharp observer of a certain late 18th century milieu, who wrote sympathetically of courtship and romance in a day when that was the only career available to a respectable woman and the only way to better her station in life, and yet died herself a spinster at a relatively early age... what if she had a tempestuous romance? What if she had herself been in deeply love, and been seriously courted? Been tempted to elope... or been tempted to marry a rich but dull man for whom she felt nothing?""Becoming Jane"" sets up just such a situation; picturing the young Jane (Anne Hathaway)  as the pretty and spirited daughter of a country parson. Her parents (played by James Cromwell  and Julie Walters) married for love and still love each other , but are poor and ever struggling to provide for themselves and their children in the upper-class manner to which they are supposed to maintain. At the age of twenty, she meets the scapegrace Tom Lefroy (James McAvoy) - and it's one of those tempestuous yet totally civilized Jane-Austinish romances, among the country balls and grand houses, carried out over the teacups. It doesn't work out, of course - but watching it unfold is at least as entertaining as one of the novels that she wrote, ensuring a happier and more conventional outcome for her heroines than what circumstances and her own choices gave to her. (And as a writer, perhaps she was happier with the writing life, after all.)",4,A lot of pleasing throw-away bits,1237593600,"03 21, 2009",2009,2335,"['movie', 'bio-pic/romantic', 'comedy', 'Becoming', 'Jane', 'little', 'likeness', 'Shakespeare', 'Love', 'pictures', 'stand', 'own', 'witty', 'literate', 'straightforward', 'narrative', 'are', 'appreciated', 'knowledgeable', 'fan', 'little', 'throwaway', 'bits', 'drawn', 'respective', 'authors', 'works', 'days', 'are', 'well', 'second', 'even', 'third', 'fourth', 'viewing', 'Whereas', 'Shakespeare', 'had', 'something', '38', 'plays', 'several', 'hundred', 'sonnets', 'two', 'long', 'poems', 'credit', 'wealth', 'literary', 'raw', 'materiel', 'work', 'doings', 'kings', 'warriors', 'great', 'matters', 'state', 'Jane', 'Austin', 'reputation', 'rests', 'six', 'novels', 'perfectly', 'constricted', 'jeweled', 'Faberge', 'Easter', 'eggs', 'Becoming', 'Jane', 'very', 'cleverly', 'draws', 'elements', 'characters', 'situations', 'constructing', 'charming', 'speculative', 'romance.What', 'Jane', 'engaging', 'witty', 'writer', 'sharp', 'observer', 'certain', 'late', '18th', 'century', 'milieu', 'who', 'wrote', 'sympathetically', 'courtship', 'romance', 'day', 'when', 'was', 'only', 'career', 'available', 'respectable', 'woman', 'only', 'way', 'better', 'station', 'life', 'yet', 'died', 'spinster', 'relatively', 'early', 'age', 'what', 'had', 'tempestuous', 'romance', 'What', 'had', 'been', 'deeply', 'love', 'been', 'seriously', 'courted', 'Been', 'tempted', 'elope', 'been', 'tempted', 'marry', 'rich', 'dull', 'man', 'whom', 'felt', 'nothing', 'Becoming', 'Jane', 'up', 'just', 'situation', 'picturing', 'young', 'Jane', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'pretty', 'spirited', 'daughter', 'country', 'parson', 'parents', 'played', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'Julie', 'Walters', 'married', 'love', 'still', 'love', 'other', 'are', 'poor', 'ever', 'struggling', 'provide', 'children', 'upper-class', 'manner', 'are', 'supposed', 'maintain', 'age', 'twenty', 'scapegrace', 'Tom', 'Lefroy', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'one', 'tempestuous', 'yet', 'totally', 'civilized', 'Jane-Austinish', 'romances', 'country', 'balls', 'grand', 'houses', 'carried', 'out', 'teacups', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'course', 'watching', 'unfold', 'least', 'as', 'entertaining', 'one', 'novels', 'wrote', 'ensuring', 'happier', 'more', 'conventional', 'outcome', 'heroines', 'what', 'circumstances', 'own', 'choices', 'gave', 'writer', 'perhaps', 'was', 'happier', 'writing', 'life']",N/A
1122422,A16RYFEIAABBFR,B000ZIZ0RA,C. Hampton,"[0, 1]","Becoming Jane takes a stab at being an historical romance similar akin to Shakespeare in Love, but something always seems to be missing. The central idea is that ""Pride and Prejudice"" may have been autobiographical. While not a bad concept, the film fails to capture either the willful spirit and poignant suffering of its subjects.It fudges the facts as many films do, but still, the more compelling emotional truth remains hidden.  After seeing this movie, you'd think that Jane could barely construct a coherent sentence until she fell for a arrogant young lawyer who, thusly, became the inspiration for Pride & Prejudice. Jane Austen did not lead the life of Elizabeth Bennett, as this film insinuates, and the context in which her life was presented is a vague insult to an illustrious, historical figure.Anne Hathaway was ill-suited to play this role.  Jane Austen truly deserved the majestic and passionate acting skills of Keira Knightley or Kate Winslet - not to mention someone with a strong and natural English accent.James McAvoy however, is quickly making his mark as a romantic leading man.  As Tom Lefroy, he gives his character the circular anguish of a life being pulled apart by the dictations of society and his burgeoning love.

1122424,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000ZIZ0RA,Chris Pandolfi,"[7, 9]","""Becoming Jane"" presents itself much like an actual Jane Austen novel, with a young girl caught in a struggle between love and security. There is, however, one major difference: unlike the characters in her novels, the real Jane Austen never married. This may partly explain why ""Becoming Jane"" works so well, going against the happily ever afters Austen made so popular. This is a thoroughly enjoyable film--witty, romantic, and heartbreaking, portraying Austen in a way that's compelling and understandable. She's a gifted young writer stuck in a world that refuses to acknowledge her talents, a world in which wealth and distinction were preferred over affection and independence. She often tells herself that she'll live by the pen, even in a time when it's expected for a woman to marry a rich suitor.Anne Hathaway plays the title character, and she gives her a soft-spoken yet determined quality that I found agreeable. The film opens during one of Jane's early morning writing sessions; when she struggles with an idea, she turns her attention to the piano and plays it loud enough to wake the entire household. It could be that the rhythmic nature of music helps her to think more clearly. Or maybe she vents her frustration by pounding a keyboard. Whatever the case, her creativity is more important than the restfulness of her family, which is just as admirable as it is annoying. It's a small act of rebellion against a group of people who love her but don't seem to understand her. This is especially true of her mother (Julie Walters), who desperately wants Jane to marry into a wealthy family. Being the wife of a poor minister (James Cromwell), Mrs. Austen tries to reason with Jane: ""Affection is desirable. Money is absolutely indispensable!""Nonetheless, Jane refuses a proposal from Mr. Wisley (Laurence Fox), the timid nephew of the wealthy, overbearing Lady Gresham (Maggie Smith). This is because she's falling in love with Tom Lefroy (James McAvoy), a young Irishman working as a lawyer. Despite the genuine feelings they have for each other, a relationship seems out of the question; not only is Tom financially dependent on his uncle (Ian Richardson), he's also free spirited and reckless, spending time in rowdy gambling halls and competing in amateur boxing matches. Here's a character that effectively personifies romantic clich&eacute;s: he's handsome, funny, and undesirable by society's standards. Quite simply, he's not good enough for Jane. Yet the two fall in love, much to everyone's disappointment.As I've already said, this material is very much like that of a Jane Austen novel. Consider the fact that Jane initially finds Tom unpleasant--not at all unlike the relationship between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy in ""Pride and Prejudice."" But that was probably the point; we periodically see Jane writing on large pieces of paper, and the voiceover narrations make it obvious that her stories are stemming from her life experiences. She's writing what she knows, like most writers do. Watching her engaged in a writing project was oddly satisfying, not only because she was accomplishing something meaningful, but also because her written words were beautiful to look at. These scenes rely heavily on close ups, each one focused on ink flowing from pen to paper; her handwriting is neat and tidy, yet personal and unique. It's almost as if the words are a natural extension of her imagination.But in early nineteenth-century England, imagination did not equal financial security, especially for a woman. As the youngest daughter of a poor family, Jane is expected to marry rich Mr. Wisley, despite her attachment to Tom, despite her passion for writing (which, according to Lady Gresham, is something to be ""done about""). This matrimonial tug of war strains the relationship between Jane and Tom, especially as she learns more about his family. She eventually begins to question their love; will it be enough to carry them through life? The further the film progresses, the more obvious the answer becomes. It's this answer that most likely influenced the endings to her novels, in which the characters ended up happily together. We all know that life doesn't always work like this. Likewise, we all know that happy endings are more satisfying to read.Jane Austen understood this, which I think made the reality of her situation all the more difficult to accept, for both her and the audience. For me, this made the film much more enjoyable. While I can't say how historically accurate ""Becoming Jane"" is, I can say that, as a film in and of itself, it's a superb effort. The performances were believable. The chemistry between Hathaway and McAvoy is strong. The dialogue was an appropriate mixture of the humorous and the dramatic. Everything came together smoothly, allowing for a film that knows how to connect with its audience.

I won't go into the ethical quandries of fictionalizing a real person's life, and whether it is right to make a film about a real person and have that person do things for which there is only speculation and no hard evidence. I don't know if Jane Austen would like this. But I do know what she would like. His name is James McAvoy. More on him in a moment.""Becoming Jane"" is based on some historical detective work that suggests Jane Austen loved a man named Tom Defroy, and took her creative inspiration from their love. It can't be proven because Jane's sister Cassandra burned all of Jane's more private letters. It is thought among some that Jane must have had romance in her life to be able to so beautifully write about it, but still we can't ever really know.The film itself is lovingly shot and well written dialogue-wise, with characters talking convincingly for the time period and spouting Austian observations that most of the time manage to be witty. There are proto-types of Austen's most famous characters, a Lady DeBourgh-type and a really irritating Lydia forerunner. Anne Hathaway plays the lady herself, and here is a sticking point: If you don't particularly like Hathaway (I don't), she won't win you over. She isn't embarassing, but she doesn't hit it out of the ball park the way Keira Knightly unexpectantly did in ""Pride and Prejudice"" a while back. She's okay. Everyone else does their job well. And then there is James McAvoy.I went to this film for James. He is the most alive actor working in film today; every second he is onscreen he's is doing something, reacting to something, letting us see his thoughts. He's sexy, charming, and heartbreaking. He embodies Tom Lefroy to perfection, even when the screenplay and Hathaway don't help him out much. His scene with Hathaway in the inn is stunning: he makes us feel the panic of a man about to lose his reason for breathing. When he is onscreen the film crackles, when he is off it goes flat and we miss him (this is used to delightful effect in the ball scene) and I will buy the film for him.The movie has narrative problems (it's almost as if scenes in the middle were cut) and occasional cheesy obviousness (lots of famous Austen lines spoken by her friends and family), but overall it's well done; a flawed movie worth seeing for a great performance. It might have happened, you never know. The theater I was at had two hundred people lined up to see it. The idea that ""Pride and Prejudice"" was a love letter to a man the author adored is an fascinating one. Maybe that's why the story endures.GRADE: A-/B+",4,"""Affection is desirable.

1122431,A1T17LMQABMBN5,B000ZIZ0RA,CoffeeGurl,"[5, 9]","Are you in the bargain for a poignant love story about two star-crossed lovers?  And are you in the bargain for a story based on one of the most beloved writers in the English language?  Becoming Jane is a beautiful film, a quasi-biopic centered on Georgian author Jane Austen and the man rumored to have been the love of her life.  Set in the 1790s, Jane Austen is the daughter of a simple clergyman, whose marriage had been one of love, but never had good financial means.  Her mother hopes that Jane marries a man of good fortune to secure her future and theirs.  There are a couple of suitors, one of whom is a man of rank, but Jane sets her eyes on Tom Lefroy, a law student and scoundrel, one who enjoys boxing matches and parties and who loathes the countryside.  What transpires is a beautiful love story in which love tries to conquer all obstacles, but in the end sensibility is the only way to go.Jane Austen would have been proud of this film.  It keeps the spirit of well-known Austen novels, like Pride and Prejudice and Persuasion.  In fact, it feels as though you are watching an adaptation of one of Austen's novels.  There is humor and social commentary as well as romance.  The setting is lovely -- the costumes and scenery are gorgeous.  Anne Hatthaway does a wonderful job as Jane.  Her English accent is rough in some areas, but it is convincing and it flows naturally, not forced like some other actresses (Scarlett Johansen springs to mind). Austen was a wonderful writer, but she was a plain girl, and Hatthaway is an attractive young woman.  I don't know if she's considered plain for Hollywood standards or Hollywood is simply incapable of casting a truly plain woman in a starring role.  Then again, Austen is regarded as pretty and a sought-after catch in the film.  I don't know if that had indeed been the case or not.  I do believe she was witty and outspoken, like the heroines in her novels, and that probably made her if not appealing, then refreshing among the men of those times.  Well, whatever the case might be, at least Hatthaway can act.  James McAvoy is charming as the rogue-turned-romantic Mr. Tom Lefroy.  McAvoy sort of reminds me of Richard Armitage (of BBC's North and South fame) with his sultry voice and luminous blue-green eyes.  He is a looker, but is also a great actor and I look forward to seeing him in Atonement (which I've already pre-ordered). Hatthaway and McAvoy have great chemistry.  I liked the scene where Lefroy is reading a rather naughty passage from a book to Jane.  I also loved their discussions about novel writing and Jane's views on irony.  Jane is depicted like the heroines in her novels -- outspoken, intelligent, witty... a woman ahead of her time.  I have no doubt that she was like that.  Maggie Smith as Lady Gresham is taken right out of Lady Catherine de Bourg, and I'm sure that viewers will find that amusing.  All in all, I absolutely loved this film.  The perfect romantic film for Valetine's Day.  This is not a biography per se, more like a romanticized version of what could have been for this beloved author.  I rented this, but will definitely buy the DVD.  I recommend this to all Jane Austen fans.

Although Hathaway is an intelligent beauty, it is James McAvoy as Thomas LeFroy who stole this show!  McAvoy is killer as the lusty London gadfly young man-about-town bouncing between boxing matches, whores and the High Court. Banished to the nether-world outerlimits of the deep English Countryside by his Court Judge Uncle-Patron-Mentor for his wild incorrigable ways, he arrives at the home of his ""lesser relations"" to serve out his penance ... and he arrives arrogant and bored.But deep in the sleepy hamlet of Hampshire England, Thomas LeFroy meets a radical shocking beauty who is evey bit his emotional, intellectual and physical equal ... who single handedly is rewriting human relationships between men and woman in the Western World, and revolutionizes Western Literature in her process.  In the schema of history it is Thomas LeFroy who is the bit player, although in the 1800s in England he earns the higher status when promoted to Chief Justice of the Court of Queen's Bench in Ireland in 1852.  Yet it is the the spurned spinster Jane Austen who earns her place in world history as one of the greatest writers of English Letters, leaving Thomas LeFroy far behind her relegated to musty literature footnotes in the modern era.In this particular movie however, it is James McAvoy as the abandoning and disappointing inspirational muse which fuels Austen's genius that moves this film from mere chick flick to a higher plane.  McAvoy is utterly brilliant as the Scottish physician in the Last King of Scotland; garnered international attention in Atonement and undoubtedly will win yet more accolades in the recently released Wanted with Angelina Jolie ... he is a super geek.

I guess this doesn't make for movie fodder, so we get an almost Romeo and Juliet-ish soap opera.  Complete with lots of supplied fiction.2. Lefroy is...who again? Lefroy drinks, fights, visits brothels; unlike Darcy, Lefroy ""rattle[s] away like other young men.""  This behavior continues for a good half of the movie until his amusing friendship with Jane genuinely turns into love.  His uncle, who controls his allowance, says no to Jane and makes him marry a wealthy girl, though Lefroy loves Jane.  Up until the end, this is the picture of Willoughby or Wickham, something that's acknowledged in the commentary.I still can't figure out where this rakish Lefroy image comes from; supposedly he was a great, upstanding guy and very diligent--his uncle was incredibly impressed with him.  I don't think anything indicates he acted this way in real life, so why bother?  It makes Jane look stupid - that she's the sort to be swept away by charming manners and a pretty face.3. Poor, jilted boy...point is?  This is a spark in the script, though a very puzzling one.  Many viewers and several movie critics picked up on the rejected Wisley, a phenomenon that's even mentioned in the commentary.  The writer very generously makes him a fantastic three-dimensional character.  But why include him at all?  Wisley was fictional.  The only mirror he has is Jane's Bigg-Wither, who wasn't around when Lefroy was and wasn't particularly gentlemanly (as Jane herself describes Wisley) but supposedly ill-tempered.  Otherwise Wisley's not even real; moreover, he takes *away* from the plot.Wisley is always polite but unnaturally quiet and seems to have trouble speaking, unlike the suave Lefroy.  He hates dancing but makes an exception for Jane and takes interest in her writing.  Even Jane herself recognizes him as honorable and gentlemanly, saying so at least twice.  He is wealthy enough.  He has a domineering aunt who only *appears* to dominate his moves: (1) he chooses Jane and Lady Gresham huffs that she doesn't understand his choice but will go along with it  (2) he clearly defies his aunt at the end in speaking to a disgraced Jane.  He wants to be loved for himself and not his wealth.His other comments have great emotional depth; unlike Lefroy's comments that Jane needs to learn how to write characters, Wisley's indicate disagreement without condescension: he comments that there is a great depth of character in every person and gently reminds Jane at the end that the good do not always come to good ends.  Even more ironically, the script makes WISLEY the source of the first words to ""Pride and Prejudice"".  His only Collins-ish move is stepping on Jane's foot in a dance (there's already a dumb vicar to fill that Collins role), but he very humbly admits that he knows he is not good at it but has been practicing (there's even a deleted scene where he practices).  We learn from a deleted scene that he even proposes (or at least attempts to) to Jane twice.Even worse, Jane's rejection of Wisley makes *her* look shallow for not seeing his inner qualities.  She even accuses Wisley of writing Lefroy's uncle to sabotage her relationship with Lefroy and doesn't apologize or show regret when she discovers it wasn't him who did it.  Moreover, Jane's attempted elopement with Lefroy comes when she is still engaged to Wisley; she is going to jilt a man she herself acknowledges as honorable without breaking it off first.  The only redeeming aspect for Jane comes sat the end when she acknowledges Wisley as a friend--very little, though, and very late.The only thing that Wisley stands to prove is (1) Jane won't marry for money alone, and who *didn't* already know that? and (2) Laurence Fox inherited his family's acting genes.  So what's the point of including him?4. Pointing out the obvious....  This is as bad the dork who always explains the punchline of a joke, and the script keeps doing it.  Mrs. Austen is sometimes a screeching harridan, prompting a friend (who totally bought the Lefroy-Jane story) to comment that they should have gotten 1995's Alison Steadman to play Mrs. Austen.  Mr. Austen is a sweet old man who indulges Jane.  The vicar is a buffonish dork (and later just awful).  Lady Gresham has Lady Catherine's lines pouring out of her mouth.  The script takes the ""Pride and Prejudice"" golf club and beats its viewers over the head with it until people start falling unconscious; even worse, it makes Jane look uncreative, as though all her witticisms are recycled from neighbors rather than coming from her own mind.As a story, the movie tanks, but it has other good stuff.  Visually it made excellent use of the (okay, mostly Irish) countryside, and Jane Gibson shows why she choreographed both the 2005 and 1995 ""P&P;""s and the 2007 and 1999 ""Mansfield Park""s.  How she indicates the level of class in the two dancing scenes--the light, cheerful dancing versus the formal balls.  The DVD itself seems pretty good.  Lots of extras - deleted scenes and interviews.Acting's pretty good, too.  McAvoy is charming, and he plays the put-upon and downtrodden lover well.  (I'd love to see his comedic work!)  Hathaway is sweet; her reading at her sister's engagement has got all the tongue-in-cheek playfulness to make it sound Austen-ish.  Their chemistry seems to work only okay, but it was hard to tell whether they didn't mesh or the script stank.  Other big names are underused but are fine in their roles.  Lucy Cohu's cousin Eliza is fantastic.My favorites, though, are Laurence Fox and Anna Maxwell Martin.  Fox's Wisley manages to be standoffish and uncomfortable while making his devotion to Jane clear, wearing a mask but letting some emotion peep through.  He sells that guy brilliantly.  Martin, though, is the scene-stealer as Cassandra.  She's not as pretty as Hathaway, but I found myself watching her rather than Hathaway when they shared scenes.  Cassandra's puzzlement when she gets Jane's letter (with all the words cut out of it), her smiles while her eyes dance with joy at her fiance, and her deep grief at his death--all brilliantly, brilliantly done.  Martin does so fantastically even with small roles (like ""Doctor Who""), but watch her earlier bonnet adventure as Esther Summerson to see her range.Fine collection of talent; too bad there's not that much for them to work from.",3,"Not terrible, but not engaging.",1218499200,"08 12, 2008",2008,7200,"['Very', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'Becoming', 'Jane', 'script', 'sucked', 'Everything', 'else',

1122445,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,B000ZIZ0RA,"Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","[21, 28]","The only portrait I ever saw of Jane Austen appears on countless spines of the Modern Library edition of ""Pride and Prejudice."" Drawn by her sister Cassandra, Jane looks, well, like one would expect the witty Miss Austen to look: poised, civilized, reflective and intelligent. With some imagination and forgiveness with regard to the talent of the artist, she could even be conceived as pretty with her large dark eyes and ringlet fringe peeking out from the typical gentlewoman's cap of that time period. How ingenious for Hollywood to cast the sumptuous Anne Hathaway with her silky brown hair, curvaceous figure, deer-in-the-headlights eyes and perfect lips as the young burgeoning author? Let's face it---no one wants to be a plain Jane - and plain she is not--she's pretty much got it all: not only is she innocently stunning, she's independent, wants to work, exhibits impeccable manners, loves her family, acts upon noble ideals all of which along with her cricket skills results in attracting and snaring the deliciously boyish James McAvoy ( Last King of Scotland) as supposed ill-fated lover, Tom Lefroy.As a film, all of this romanticism works wonderfully. The verdant countryside shimmers in the sunshine. The period clothing---all empire waists, beribboned hair, top hats and velvet frockcoats----sway and rustle delightfully as the couples dance and speak in clever well-mannered innuendo as expectant matchmaking parents play chaperone and contemplate lucrative alliances that will set their children up for life. The dialogue sufficiently reflects that Austenian repartee which the educated audience delights in as it makes them feel they are on an even keel with one of the greatest satirists in the English language. The notion of Austen's relationship with Lefroy as presented first in Jon Spence's biography from which the film gets its name, suggests that many of Austen's dream partnerships as presented in her novels were based on actual, personal and emotional incidents that although painful, gave her characters so much flesh and blood poignancy, we still discuss them today.Whether or not any of this is actually true matters naught. The film seduces with the same charming intensity of McAvoy's blue-eyed stare as he quite openly undresses Hathaway in his mind. Is Lefroy the basis for Mr. Darcy? This is difficult to say, but I wouldn't mind bumping into this film's Tom Lefroy while I was taking my daily constitutional. Of course, I'd have to go back in time to become a few years younger---or perhaps not as flirty cousin Eliza de Feuillide certainly does have her way with Jane's rakish brother, Henry Austen (Joe Anderson)---oh, what money can buy!With that in mind, leave the historical authenticity to the Austen scholars and enjoy the film for its performances and its visual delights. Secondary players congregate to form a veritable Austen menagerie of characters that for the most part plays a bit too conveniently to reflect reality. But take it all in fun ---the film leads one to believe that Austen needed little imagination to conceptualize her personalities; rather they were all there under her nose, just waiting to be captured on paper. Nevertheless, Maggie Smith as the formidable Lady Gresham never fails to elicit a chuckle as does her fictional counterpart Lady Catherine de Bourgh from ""Pride and Prejudice."" Julie Walters and James Cromwell as Jane's parents seem the perfect Mr. and Mrs Bennett clones while Laurence Fox, as Mr. Wisley (Mr. Collins again from ""Pride and Prejudice"") interjects just the right 21st century computer geek persona to the mix to act the perfect foil for the more glamorous but definitely shallower Tom Lefroy character.Bottom line: After countless Masterpiece Theatre adaptations of all six of Jane Austen's novels as well as a herd of popular films set to popular music (Bride and Prejudice was one Bollywood version) it is not surprising that the author herself has come into scrutiny in this charming albeit fictionalized biopic. If you are not tired of yet another Darcy/Bennett rendition, you will most likely find ""Becoming Jane"" two hours worth of Jane Austen's world lovingly preserved.

1122446,A1I477ADGMLVJM,B000ZIZ0RA,"D. Matlack ""Guidedog""","[0, 1]","First off this is a ""speculative view"" of Jane Austen's life based on the few small clues of her life & social circle that are left to us. So everyone out there who is having a fit over unsubstatiated claims should calm down. The producers never claim that they are making a factual biography.Second the cast and the acting are all enjoyable. I have no problem whatsoever with Anne Hathaway playing a Brit, it might not be perfect but she does a superior performance to Gwennie Paltrow's absolutely brutal brit-impressions. James McAvoy is a lot of fun in this movie, but it is his facial expressions which convey the most. Together, he & miss Hathaway will literally break your heart! Most of us are aware that Jane Austen never married, going into the movie with that knowledge does not spare the viewer from sadness & disapointment.As a fantasy of Ms. Austen's life the story, though not riviting is performed very well and is enjoyable. Not so enjoyable is, as several previous reviewers pointed out, the blatant sexuality and inneundo that pops in rather unexpectedly from time-to-time.

The screen lights up whenever she is in a scene and Hathaway has a way of commanding your attention.  For me, she bares more than a passing resemblance to the late, great Audrey Hepburn.  In BECOMING JANE, Anne Hathaway portrays the lead role of the great author Jane Austen.  For once, we get a sense of who Jane was as a young, up-and-coming writer and that the romantic intrigues that we read about in her novels (SENSE AND SENSIBILITY, PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, EMMA, and PERSUASION, among others) were prompted by Austen's own experiences love and longing.  Austen's on background was quite modest, she being the daughter of a poor church minister (James Cromwell) and his wife (Julie Christie) struggling to make ends meet.  It is highly doubtful that Jane will meet anyone for whom marriage is a prospect.  Enter Thomas LeFroy (James McAvoy), an aspiring lawyer with a rather rakish reputation.  Rarely is he seen without women or a drink in his hand, when out carousing with his friends.  Jane Austen feverishly writes away and reads passages from her works out loud to friends and family, while LeFroy smirks in the corner and makes unflattering comments about her work and writing style.  Jane hears his remarks and this creates a great rift--but, as we see in Austen's novels, tension is often a thinly-veiled and misapplied form of attraction between characters.  Thus, the plot thickens.I must say that I was impressed with Anne Hathaway and her presence throughout the duration of the film, and her supporting cast worked really well together.  What's more, the lively script is peppered with humorous banter, as well as insightful commentary.  It's really engrossing to witness the evolution of a young writer who went on to become one of the most well-respected and loved contributors to fiction.  Though, this film is based on a fictionalized account of Jane Austen's life (prompted by a series of letters exchanged between Jane Austen and Thomas LeFroy), it's still a very thought-provoking journey.",5,BECOMING JANE is aesthetically beautiful and very well-acted.....,1187481600,"08 19, 2007",2007,2127,"['am', 'sure', 'am', 'not', 'first', 'say', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'one', 'most', 'illuminous', 'actresses', 'generation', 'screen', 'up', 'whenever', 'scene', 'Hathaway', 'way', 'commanding', 'attention', 'more', 'passing', 'resemblance', 'late', 'great', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'BECOMING', 'JANE', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'lead', 'role', 'great', 'author', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'once', 'get', 'sense', 'who', 'Jane', 'was', 'young', 'up-and-coming', 'writer', 'romantic', 'intrigues', 'read', 'novels', 'SENSE', 'AND', 'SENSIBILITY', 'PRIDE', 'AND', 'PREJUDICE', 'EMMA', 'PERSUASION', 'others', 'were', 'prompted', 'Austen', 'own', 'experiences', 'love', 'longing', 'Austen', 'background', 'was', 'quite', 'modest', 'being', 'daughter', 'poor', 'church', 'minister', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'wife', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'struggling', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'highly', 'doubtful', 'Jane', 'will', 'meet', 'anyone', 'whom', 'marriage', 'prospect', 'Enter', 'Thomas', 'LeFroy', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'aspiring', 'lawyer', 'rather', 'rakish', 'reputation', 'Rarely', 'seen', 'women', 'drink', 'hand', 'when', 'out', 'carousing', 'friends', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'feverishly', 'away', 'reads', 'passages', 'works', 'out', 'loud', 'friends', 'family', 'LeFroy', 'smirks', 'corner', 'unflattering', 'comments', 'work', 'writing', 'style', 'Jane', 'remarks', 'great', 'rift', 'see', 'Austen', 'novels', 'tension', 'often', 'thinly-veiled', 'misapplied', 'form', 'attraction', 'characters', 'Thus', 'plot', 'thickens.I', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'impressed', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'presence', 'duration', 'film', 'supporting', 'cast', 'worked', 'really', 'well', 'together', 'What', 'more', 'lively', 'script', 'peppered', 'humorous', 'banter', 'as', 'well', 'insightful', 'commentary', 'really', 'engrossing', 'witness', 'evolution', 'young', 'writer', 'who', 'went', 'become', 'one', 'most', 'well-respected', 'loved', 'contributors', 'fiction', 'Though', 'film', 'based', 'fictionalized', 'account', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'life', 'prompted', 'series', 'letters', 'exchanged', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'Thomas', 'LeFroy', 'still', 'very', 'thought-provoking', 'journey']",N/A

The result is a charming period romance that will appreciated by many viewers.  Anne Hathaway is immensely enjoyable as the clever, spirited, and headstrong young author; James MacAvoy is absolutely charming as Tom LeFroy, the smart and passionate young man who steals her heart.  Together, they have heartbreaking chemistry on the screen.""Becoming Jane"" recreates the Austen family's existance in a rural Hampshire village of 1795.  James Cromwell and Julie Walters are superb as Jane's parents, making a barely tolerable living out of his cleric pay for Jane's many brothers and beloved sister Cassandra.  Jane is an aspiring writer who entertains her family with readings of her work.  Into the picture falls Tom LeFroy, reckless, penniless, and carousing young lawyer-in-training from London, who manages to insult Jane at their first meeting.  Jane will repay the favor, and out of a clash of egos comes the sparks of romance.  Jane and Tom will fall in love, against the expressed wishes of their respective parents and guardian, who expect marriage to wealthier partners.  The desperate couple will be forced to weigh their feelings against the reality of their family obligations.The movie is to be commended for its portrayal of the hard facts of 18th century life; marrying for love was a luxury women of Jane's social class could ill-afford.  Jane's brother George, in real life either retarded or physically handicapped, is here touchingly portrayed as a deaf-mute. The movie gives full faith and credit to the strong family ties that had so much influence on the real Jane Austen's life.The movie conflates a number of separate events into a short time span.  As best it can be determined, the real Jane and Tom were separated by their relatives in early 1796 and never met again.  Cassandra's fiance did tragically die in the Caribbean, but in 1797.  Jane did receive, and initially accept, a proposal of marriage from a wealthy young man whom she did not love, but in 1802. The London meeting with Ann Radcliff, a famous Gothic novelist of the period, apparently is entirely fiction.It was Jane Austen's strength as a writer that she drew from her observations of life.  Her characters and their lives are still entirely believable 200 years on.  Jane wrote the initial drafts of three of her six finished novels in the years around her relationship with Tom LeFroy, whatever it was.  Jane Austen fans will note numerous lines and portents from her future novels embedded in this movie.""Becoming Jane"" is a charming dramatization of the life of the young Jane Austen.  If its portrayal owes much to the imagination of the screenwriters, its spirit is certainly consistent with what we know and treasure of the real Jane Austen.  It is therefore highly recommended as a good period romance and good entertainment that may make a few new fans for Jane Austen.",4,Imagining Jane....,1207958400,"04 12, 2008",2008,2997,"['2007', 'Becoming', 'Jane', 'romantic', 'fictional', 'flesh', 'rather', 'skeletal', 'facts', 'life', 'novelist', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'result', 'charming', 'period', 'romance', 'will', 'appreciated', 'many', 'viewers', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'immensely', 'enjoyable', 'clever', 'spirited', 'headstrong', 'young', 'author', 'James', 'MacAvoy', 'absolutely', 'charming', 'Tom', 'LeFroy', 'smart', 'passionate', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'heart', 'Together', 'have', 'heartbreaking', 'chemistry', 'screen', 'Becoming', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'family', 'existance', 'rural', 'Hampshire', 'village', '1795', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'Julie', 'Walters', 'are', 'superb', 'Jane', 'parents', 'making', 'barely', 'tolerable', 'living', 'cleric', 'pay', 'Jane', 'many', 'brothers', 'beloved', 'sister', 'Cassandra', 'Jane', 'aspiring', 'writer', 'who', 'family', 'readings', 'work', 'picture', 'Tom', 'LeFroy', 'reckless', 'penniless', 'carousing', 'young', 'lawyer-in-training', 'London', 'who', 'insult', 'Jane', 'first', 'meeting', 'Jane', 'will', 'repay', 'favor', 'clash', 'egos', 'sparks', 'romance', 'Jane', 'Tom', 'will', 'fall', 'love', 'expressed', 'wishes', 'respective', 'parents', 'guardian', 'who', 'expect', 'marriage', 'wealthier', 'partners', 'desperate', 'couple', 'will', 'be', 'forced', 'weigh', 'feelings', 'reality', 'family', 'movie', 'be', 'commended', 'portrayal', 'hard', 'facts', '18th', 'century', 'life', 'marrying', 'love', 'was', 'luxury', 'women', 'Jane', 'social', 'class', 'could', 'ill-afford', 'Jane', 'brother', 'George', 'real', 'life', 'retarded', 'physically', 'handicapped', 'here', 'touchingly', 'portrayed', 'deaf-mute', 'movie', 'full', 'faith', 'credit', 'strong', 'family', 'ties', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'influence', 'real', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'life.The', 'movie', 'number', 'separate', 'events', 'short', 'time', 'span', 'can', 'be', 'determined', 'real', 'Jane', 'Tom', 'were', 'separated', 'relatives', 'early', '1796', 'never', 'met', 'again', 'Cassandra', 'fiance', 'did', 'tragically', 'die', 'Caribbean', '1797', 'Jane', 'did', 'receive', 'initially', 'accept', 'proposal', 'marriage', 'wealthy', 'young', 'man', 'whom', 'did', 'not', 'love', '1802', 'London', 'meeting', 'Ann', 'Radcliff', 'famous', 'Gothic', 'novelist', 'period', 'apparently', 'entirely', 'fiction.It', 'was', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'strength', 'writer', 'drew', 'observations', 'life', 'characters', 'lives', 'are', 'still', 'entirely', 'believable', '200', 'years', 'Jane', 'wrote', 'initial', 'drafts', 'three', 'six', 'finished', 'novels', 'years', 'relationship', 'Tom', 'LeFroy', 'whatever', 'was', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'fans', 'will', 'note', 'numerous', 'lines', 'portents', 'future', 'novels', 'embedded', 'movie', 'Becoming', 'Jane', 'charming', 'dramatization', 'life', 'young', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'portrayal', 'owes', 'much', 'imagination', 'screenwriters', 'spirit', 'certainly', 'consistent', 'what', 'know', 'treasure', 'real', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'therefore', 'highly', 'recommended', 'good', 'period', 'romance', 'good', 'entertainment', 'may', 'make', 'few', 'new', 'fans', 'Jane', 'Austen']",N/A

James McAvoy exudes a delightful plausibility as the handsome Mr. LeFroy; Maggie Smith (far more restrained than in her usual delicious comic roles) presents a believably dignified Lady of the Manor; and Lawrence Fox, allowed to stray from the solemnity of Inspector Lewis' intellectual sergeant, does an amusing turn as Jane's country-bumpkin suitor-with-prospects.I especially appreciate the covert allusions throughout the film to plot-points in Austen's novels. As for some of the ""How-dare-they-deviate-from-Jane-Austen's-actual-life?"" criticisms, I can only comment that my fondness for Mozart did not cause me to enjoy ""Amadeus"" any the less because it did not follow ""the facts"" of the composer's life; or because it was shot in Prague instead of Vienna. Neither do I complain that ""Becoming Jane"" was shot in Ireland instead of Hampshire. Whether fanciful or true, ""Becoming Jane"" provides a most pleasant evening of entertainment.

This movie looked like Pride and Prejudice, but was very bittersweet knowing that Jane Austen never married and died at such a young age.  At a time when there were very few female authors; Jane Autsen was a trend setter.  The movie features a romance between Jane and Tom Lefroy, played by James McAvoy.  I couldn't help but compare Jane's ""real"" life to the novel Pride and Prejudice.  This is a fun and endearing film.

Or rather that someone did.  We know so little of her life because Jane was not the most successful member of her family- that distinction belongs to her older brother Frances Austen, who rose to become the highest ranking officer in the Royal Navy at a time when the Royal navy ruled the waves. As one of the most powerful and influential men in the British Empire Sir Frances could and evidently did severly curtail the information we have about Jane.

It is not unvarnished fact.  The unvarnished facts of Austen's life are considerably sadder even than the somewhat melancholy portrait here.  Even so, I found many charms to recommend this foray into the alternate Austen universe inspired by Jane's real life.  Anne Hathaway uses her dark beauty and spiritedness to good effect, and is more winning here than in her sometimes grating and pouty turn in ""The Devil Wears Prada"".  At 5'8"" she stands a good 10 inches taller than the real Jane and has a contemporary glamor that reminds us that she is in fact, of our time, not the late 18th century.  But she and James McAvoy achieve a quirky chemistry together and are well-matched as a couple.  Julie Walters and James Cromwell comport themselves with the delightful fussbudgetry one would expect of Austenian parents; there are echoes of the Bennet family everywhere.  Austen famously celebrated the relationship between sisters, and we can see the roots in her devotion to her elder sister Cassandra, who like Jane herself would remain unmarried throughout her life.  The costumes and dancing scenes are brilliantly done, and Ireland standing in for Jane's England makes for a lush and breathtaking setting.  Jane herself did not enjoy the happiness in love that she provides her heroines, but if you are a fan of anything Austen, this deserves a place on your movie shelf.",4,An Amiable Alternate Austen,1210118400,"05 7, 2008",2008,1521,"['fictionalized', 'account', 'period', 'young', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'life', 'might', 'have', 'written', 'one', 'own', 'novels', 'not', 'unvarnished', 'fact', 'unvarnished', 'facts', 'Austen', 'life', 'are', 'considerably', 'sadder', 'even', 'somewhat', 'melancholy', 'portrait', 'here', 'Even', 'so', 'found', 'many', 'charms', 'recommend', 'foray', 'alternate', 'Austen', 'universe', 'inspired', 'Jane', 'real', 'life', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'dark', 'beauty', 'spiritedness', 'good', 'effect', 'more', 'winning', 'here', 'sometimes', 'grating', 'pouty', 'turn', 'Devil', 'Wears', 'Prada', '5', '8', 'good', '10', 'inches', 'taller', 'real', 'Jane', 'contemporary', 'glamor', 'fact', 'time', 'not', 'late', '18th', 'century', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'achieve', 'quirky', 'chemistry', 'together', 'are', 'well-matched', 'couple', 'Julie', 'Walters', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'comport', 'delightful', 'fussbudgetry', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'Austenian', 'parents', 'are', 'echoes', 'Bennet', 'family', 'everywhere', 'Austen', 'famously', 'celebrated', 'relationship', 'sisters', 'can', 'see', 'roots', 'devotion', 'elder', 'sister', 'Cassandra', 'who', 'Jane', 'would', 'remain', 'unmarried', 'life', 'costumes', 'dancing', 'scenes', 'are', 'brilliantly', 'done', 'Ireland', 'standing', 'Jane', 'England', 'lush', 'breathtaking', 'setting', 'Jane', 'did', 'not', 'enjoy', 'happiness', 'love', 'heroines', 'are', 'fan', 'anything', 'Austen', 'place', 'movie', 'shelf']",N/A

Now, I can't imagine anyone else. Don't get me wrong; Anne is a fine actress that I have enjoyed in the Princess movies and in ""The Devil Wears Prada"" many times. She just didn't leap to mind as the title character. But she successfully BECAME Jane Austen.Like many other women of my age, and many writers, I admire Jane Austen's work enormously. And I've enjoyed the recent resurgence of interest in her work, sparked by such commercial successes such as Emma Thompson's ""Sense and Sensibility"", Gwnyeth Paltrow's ""Emma"", and even ""Clueless."" BBC's rendition of ""Pride and Prejudice"" was the first DVD I bought. But like many other fans, I have often lamented the fact that Jane only wrote six novels (a seventh, ""Sandriton"", was incomplete at her death), and that she never wrote about herself directly (following the British creed of the time that a gentlewoman did not). Personal details are elicited from her letters to her sister and friends, and from the biography written about her by her brother after her death. This movie, while not claiming to be a strict biography, is certainly true to the Jane you can synthesize from her characters, in particular Elizabeth Bennett, but also Elinor of ""Sense and Sensibility"" as well as other of her female characters. The humor and public persona is Elizabeth, but the polite facade hiding a seething passion is pure Elinor, while the wistful regret is definitely Anne of ""Persuasion.""The ensemble cast (my favorite is Maggie Smith!) combined with an intelligent script makes this more than just a period costume drama...it makes it a true drama that just happened to be filmed in period costumes. It could easily be updated to modern times, with one exception -- in this time and place, very few people exercise the emotional restraint common at the time. That restraint, and the tension it causes, are what make this movie interesting.Will this movie join ""Casablanca"" (another movie about restraint) on the 100 movies of all time list? Probably not.

I was offended by the movie's suggestion that most of Jane Austen's great lines were things that other people made up. Jane is always jotting down clever things other people say, and I choose to believe that she was much more of a creative genius than that. However, the overall tone was respectful and even loving towards Austen, and James McAvoy is just an awesome actor. Despite the fact that he lacks typical movie star looks, he pulls off a total charm job, smoldering his way through the 18th century sets to win Jane's heart, and the audience's as well.

Jane Austen broke the rules.  She wanted to marry for love, not for money or comfort.  When you break the rules you will be punished by society, because society holds on tooth and nail to the status quo.  That hasn't changed but people ignore a lot of it today (sometimes at their own peril).  A great love was lost because the lovers had no control over their own lives.  In the end Jane never married, he did, of course, but their love was solid all the days of their lives (not that it did either of them any good).  Society is a hard task master.  This is a politically loaded movie.  Depressing for sure...no happy ending.  Having the love of your life name his oldest daughter, from another woman, after you, would not be considered a happy ending in the opinion of most people.  Jane, however, seemed pleased.  Basically, the man she loved was willing to run away with her and give up everything (or at lest try).  But Jane, being ""responsible,"" and deciding for both of them based on an ASSUMPTION, felt that he would resent her later if she took him away from caring for his parents.  He tried, she just caved and let the love of her life go.  No gold medals for Jane. He went on with his life and was a good boy.  She wrote and kind of wasted away.  At the end of the movie she looks frail and pathetic next to her sister-in-law who is about 10 years older than she is.  It's not a beautiful film either.  It's dark and dreary.

1122509,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000ZIZ0RA,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[5, 8]","The premise of ""Becoming Jane"" is relatively simple, to wit: turn Jane Austen's life into a Jane Austen novel.  The problem is that Austen's life was not like one of her novels: the author died at the age of 41 having never married.  But we know from her letters that the young Austen flirted with a man named Thomas Langlois Lefroy in 1796 when she was 21 and at the mid-point of her life.  Given that it is rather depressing to think that the greatest romance writer of all time lived a life devoid of romance the script by television writers Kevin Hood and Sarah Williams takes that fact and germinates it into the idea that Lefroy was indeed the great love of Austen's life, with Anne Hathaway and James McAvoy as the star-crossed couple.  After all, Austen only wrote six complete novels and we want more.We know that Austen wrote her initial version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" between 1796 and 1797, entitled ""First Impressions"" at that point (the revised novel was not published under 1813).  This 2007 film follows the conventional wisdom (or wishful thinking) that Austen is most like her heroine Elizabeth Bennett in ""Pride and Prejudice.""  Like Elizabeth, Jane has a mother who wants to see her married, a father who wants her to be happy, a beloved older sister, and a proposal from an unwanted suitor.  But ""Becoming Jane"" wants to suggest that while Elizabeth ended up with Mr. Darcy, Jane herself was smitten with a bad boy like Wickham.  To be fair, Tom Lefroy is more like Willoughby in ""Sense and Sensibility"" in terms of extenuating situation, if not character, but he is clearly a bad boy waited to be tamed by the young woman who would go on to be one of the most celebrated and important novelists of all-time (in terms of importance I would put Austen on a tiny pedestal with Cervantes and James Joyce).The obvious comparison here is to ""Shakespeare in Love,"" with strong parallels between the plot of the movie and those of a couple of plays.  There are references to various works by Austen throughout the film (e.g., Jane meets Ann Radcliffe, the author of popular Gothic novels that Austen satirized in writing ""Northanger Abbey"").  The more you know about Austen the more you will enjoy such elements, but perhaps the less likely to enjoy a fictional version of her love life.  However, because Austen is a novelist and not a playwright, ""Becoming Jane"" is denied the (literally) dramatic finish of the film that won the Best Picture Oscar in 1999.  Still, this movie does come up with an emotional ending, taking advantage of another historic fact to give us something to cry about before the final credits, to make up for the fact that we were never going to get the ""incandescent"" ending of an actual Jane Austen novel.Unconcerned as I am by such concerns as accents and posture, I found Hathaway to be well cast as the Jane Austen I would like to see on screen, equal measure intelligence and spunk in the face of a society that well deserves her ironic critique.  McAvoy is serviceable as the man who lets Jane get away, but that makes it hard to really warm up to his character, especially once it becomes clear he has more to do with the bad boys of Austen's novels.  The supporting cast features Julie Walters and James Cromwell as Jane's parents, Maggie Smith as Lady Gresham, and Ian Richardson as Judge Langlois.  However, the supporting player I liked the most was Laurence Fox as Mr. Wisley, the young man who gets down on bended knee and proposes to Jane.  He is dismissed as a ""booby,"" but it is clear that no man is really good enough for our girl.  But Mr. Wisley is nothing like the obsequiese Mr. Collins from ""Pride and Prejudice,"" and in his final conversation with Jane delivers the most telling line in the film.  A more telling point would be that neither Wisley nor Collins appears to be like Harris Bigg-Wither, who proposed to Austen in 1802, a final reminder that ""Becoming Jane"" is biographical fiction and not just a fictional biography.",4,"Anne Hathaway as Jane in a movie that is clearly ""Austen in Love""",1187049600,"08 14, 2007",2007,3993,"['premise', 'Becoming', 'Jane', 'relatively', 'simple', 'wit', 'turn', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'life', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'novel', 'problem', 'Austen', 'life', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'novels', 'author', 'died', 'age', '41', 'having', 'never', 'married', 'know', 'letters', 'young', 'Austen', 'flirted', 'man', 'named', 'Thomas', 'Langlois', 'Lefroy', '1796', 'when', 'was', '21', 'mid-point', 'life', 'Given', 'rather', 'depressing', 'think', 'greatest', 'romance', 'writer', 'time', 'lived', 'life', 'devoid', 'romance', 'script', 'television', 'writers', 'Kevin', 'Hood', 'Sarah', 'Williams', 'fact', 'idea', 'Lefroy', 'was', 'indeed', 'great', 'love', 'Austen', 'life', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'star-crossed', 'couple', 'Austen', 'only', 'wrote', 'six', 'complete', 'novels', 'want', 'more.We', 'know', 'Austen', 'wrote', 'initial', 'version', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', '1796', '1797', 'entitled', 'First', 'Impressions', 'point', 'revised', 'novel', 'was', 'not', 'published', '1813', '2007', 'film', 'conventional', 'wisdom', 'wishful', 'thinking', 'Austen', 'most', 'heroine', 'Elizabeth', 'Bennett', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'Elizabeth', 'Jane', 'mother', 'who', 'see', 'married', 'father', 'who', 'be', 'happy', 'beloved', 'older', 'sister', 'proposal', 'unwanted', 'suitor', 'Becoming', 'Jane', 'suggest', 'Elizabeth', 'ended', 'up', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'Jane', 'was', 'smitten', 'bad', 'boy', 'Wickham', 'be', 'fair', 'Tom', 'Lefroy', 'more', 'like', 'Willoughby', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'terms', 'extenuating', 'situation', 'not', 'character', 'clearly', 'bad', 'boy', 'waited', 'be', 'tamed', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'would', 'go', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'celebrated', 'important', 'novelists', 'all-time', 'terms', 'importance', 'would', 'put', 'Austen', 'tiny', 'pedestal', 'Cervantes', 'James', 'Joyce', '.The', 'obvious', 'comparison', 'here', 'Shakespeare', 'Love', 'strong', 'parallels', 'plot', 'movie', 'couple', 'plays', 'are', 'references', 'various', 'works', 'Austen', 'film', 'e.g.', 'Jane', 'Ann', 'Radcliffe', 'author', 'popular', 'Gothic', 'novels', 'Austen', 'satirized', 'writing', 'Northanger', 'Abbey', 'more', 'know', 'Austen', 'more', 'will', 'enjoy', 'such', 'elements', 'perhaps', 'less', 'likely', 'enjoy', 'fictional', 'version', 'love', 'life', 'However', 'Austen', 'novelist', 'not', 'playwright', 'Becoming', 'Jane', 'denied', 'literally', 'dramatic', 'finish', 'film', 'won', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Oscar', '1999', 'Still', 'movie', 'come', 'up', 'emotional', 'ending', 'taking', 'advantage', 'historic', 'fact', 'give', 'something', 'cry', 'final', 'credits', 'make', 'up', 'fact', 'were', 'never', 'going', 'get', 'incandescent', 'ending', 'actual', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'novel.Unconcerned', 'am', 'such', 'concerns', 'accents', 'posture', 'found', 'Hathaway', 'be', 'well', 'cast', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'screen', 'equal', 'measure', 'intelligence', 'spunk', 'face', 'society', 'well', 'ironic', 'critique', 'McAvoy', 'serviceable', 'man', 'who', 'Jane', 'get', 'away', 'hard', 'really', 'warm', 'up', 'character', 'especially', 'clear', 'more', 'do', 'bad', 'boys', 'Austen', 'novels', 'supporting', 'cast', 'features', 'Julie', 'Walters', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'Jane', 'parents', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'Lady', 'Gresham', 'Ian', 'Richardson', 'Judge', 'Langlois', 'However', 'supporting', 'player', 'liked', 'most', 'was', 'Laurence', 'Fox', 'Mr.', 'Wisley', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'down', 'bended', 'knee', 'Jane', 'dismissed', 'booby', 'clear', 'man', 'really', 'good', 'enough', 'girl', 'Mr.', 'Wisley', 'nothing', 'obsequiese', 'Mr.', 'Collins', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'final', 'conversation', 'Jane', 'delivers', 'most', 'telling', 'line', 'film', 'more', 'telling', 'point', 'would', 'be', 'Wisley', 'Collins', 'be', 'Harris', 'Bigg-Wither', 'who', 'proposed', 'Austen', '1802', 'final', 'reminder', 'Becoming', 'Jane', 'biographical', 'fiction', 'not', 'just', 'fictional', 'biography']",N/A

Most films have been based upon her novels. Becoming Jane, like PBS's Miss Austen Regrets, is based upon her own life, important details of which were intentionally obscured by her protector, brother Henry Austen. It's fun to watch Anne Hatheway, who is probably infinitely more beautiful than the real Jane, as she portrays her in her youth, an aspiring writer struggling with the same identity/life issues as any other 20 year old. It's difficult to believe that Jane was actually beset simultaneously by three avid suitors, but what this script conveys well is a way in which one of the central themes of the novels, whether tis better to marry for love or money, might have played out in Jane's young life. What this movie does not convey is the truth about the poverty in her family, who in this production appear to live as well as their wealthy  acquaintances (except for those rare occasions in which they are shown digging potatoes or looking at the pigs.) Talking about being poor is not the same as seeing it.That said, Beooming Jane is a treat to watch. Costumes, scenery, music, indoor sets - all beautifully done. The acting is of the highest quality.

And it would have been difficult to have been a mother of many and written her many novels.  Jane's novels were her children in a way.  It's unfortunate Jane died in her forties at the height of her writing career - think of all the novels she might have written for us if she had lived to 70 or 75.After watching this film, if you want an excellent biography on Jane Austen you might enjoyJane Austen: A Lifeby Claire Tomalin.

1122519,A1TWTULVD6F22O,B000ZIZ0RA,"L. Quido ""quidrock""","[31, 43]","In the 2007 stylized version of what Jane's real life might have been like, the writers take a page from biographer Jon Spence's ""Becoming Jane Austen"". Spence took some known facts... that Tom Le Foy, an Irish lawyer, really existed, did meet Austen while still in law school and that he eventually named his daughter Jane.. and built the foundation for Austen's themes (specifically her plot in Pride and Prejudice) in the roots of her own love life. Fact or fiction?It is easy to believe the relationship between Jane's own life and this film, because the writers have tied events in the film to events in Jane's eventual books. Jane's as poor as a churchmouse, so is young Le Foy. All of their adult influences make it clear that they must marry for money. Wrapped in stunning cinematography and beautiful music, you are tempted to believe.As a period and costume drama, the film is entertaining with some whimsy, and deserved a wider audience. That will doubtlessly occur with the release of the DVD (and unfortunately, the release is one week after still ANOTHER, this time contemporary, treatise on Jane Austen, the film, ""The Jane Austen Book Club""). The DVD is short on special features, but worthwhile for the chance to see another excellent performance by Britain's James McAvoy.Cast opposite American actress Anne Hathaway, McAvoy, who labored long in minor film roles and on British television plays well as a charming, dashing, cad who deliberately takes up the task of shocking and teasing the provincial young Jane, only to be caught up in the mix of intellect, beauty and spunk that Hathaway manages in the film. McAvoy is believable and sexy -- you can't help but compare him favorably to Matthew MacFadyen, Mr. Darcy from 2005's ""Pride and Prejudice"". MacFadyen was wooden and brought a fine film down. McAvoy, (despite an unfavorable height differential!) who was a revelation in ""The Last King of Scotland"" and who draws sparks with Keira Knightley in this year's ""Atonement"" is an uplift for this film.Hathaway is better in her role than expected, even with the weight of conquering a British accent, although she does a credible job. This is her best performance yet, on the screen, but she's a little bland in comparison to other Austen screen heroines....Gwyneth Paltrow, Kate Winslet and the aforementioned Knightley.There are some excellent supporting players; parents Julie Walters and James Cromwell.... Tom's uncle, played by the redoubtable Ian Richardson in his last role, Maggie Smith, imperious as ever as Jane's almost mother-in-law.Perhaps I would have enjoyed the film more if we weren't getting saturated with Austen on the screen -- and I did enjoy the romance and heartache both in theater and on DVD. However, an earlier attempt at fictionalizing an author's love life and the impact it had on his writing...the delightful ""Shakespeare in Love"" had those comedic touches and chemistry between the leads that were far superior to this film.",4,"McAvoy sets off sparks, Hathaway holds her own....",1201996800,"02 3, 2008",2008,2980,"['2007', 'stylized', 'version', 'what', 'Jane', 'real', 'life', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'writers', 'take', 'page', 'biographer', 'Jon', 'Spence', 'Becoming', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'Spence', 'took', 'known', 'facts', 'Tom', 'Le', 'Foy', 'Irish', 'lawyer', 'really', 'existed', 'did', 'meet', 'Austen', 'still', 'law', 'school', 'eventually', 'named', 'daughter', 'Jane..', 'built', 'foundation', 'Austen', 'themes', 'specifically', 'plot', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'roots', 'own', 'love', 'life', 'Fact', 'fiction', 'easy', 'believe', 'relationship', 'Jane', 'own', 'life', 'film', 'writers', 'have', 'tied', 'events', 'film', 'events', 'Jane', 'eventual', 'books', 'Jane', 'as', 'poor', 'churchmouse', 'so', 'young', 'Le', 'Foy', 'adult', 'influences', 'make', 'clear', 'must', 'marry', 'money', 'Wrapped', 'stunning', 'cinematography', 'beautiful', 'music', 'are', 'tempted', 'believe.As', 'period', 'costume', 'drama', 'film', 'entertaining', 'whimsy', 'deserved', 'wider', 'audience', 'will', 'doubtlessly', 'occur', 'release', 'DVD', 'unfortunately', 'release', 'one', 'week', 'still', 'ANOTHER', 'time', 'contemporary', 'treatise', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'film', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'Book', 'Club', 'DVD', 'short', 'special', 'features', 'worthwhile', 'chance', 'see', 'excellent', 'performance', 'Britain', 'James', 'McAvoy.Cast', 'opposite', 'American', 'actress', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'McAvoy', 'who', 'labored', 'long', 'minor', 'film', 'roles', 'British', 'television', 'plays', 'well', 'charming', 'dashing', 'cad', 'who', 'deliberately', 'up', 'task', 'shocking', 'teasing', 'provincial', 'young', 'Jane', 'only', 'be', 'caught', 'up', 'mix', 'intellect', 'beauty', 'spunk', 'Hathaway', 'film', 'McAvoy', 'believable', 'sexy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'compare', 'favorably', 'Matthew', 'MacFadyen', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', '2005', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'MacFadyen', 'was', 'wooden', 'brought', 'fine', 'film', 'down', 'McAvoy', 'unfavorable', 'height', 'differential', 'who', 'was', 'revelation', 'Last', 'King', 'Scotland', 'who', 'draws', 'sparks', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'year', 'Atonement', 'uplift', 'film.Hathaway', 'better', 'role', 'expected', 'even', 'weight', 'conquering', 'British', 'accent', 'credible', 'job', 'best', 'performance', 'yet', 'screen', 'little', 'bland', 'comparison', 'other', 'Austen', 'screen', 'heroines', '.Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'aforementioned', 'Knightley.There', 'are', 'excellent', 'supporting', 'players', 'parents', 'Julie', 'Walters', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'Tom', 'uncle', 'played', 'redoubtable', 'Ian', 'Richardson', 'last', 'role', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'imperious', 'as', 'ever', 'Jane', 'almost', 'mother-in-law.Perhaps', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'more', 'were', ""n't"", 'getting', 'saturated', 'Austen', 'screen', 'did', 'enjoy', 'romance', 'heartache', 'theater', 'DVD', 'However', 'earlier', 'attempt', 'fictionalizing', 'author', 'love', 'life', 'impact', 'had', 'writing', 'delightful', 'Shakespeare', 'Love', 'had', 'comedic', 'touches', 'chemistry', 'leads', 'were', 'far', 'superior', 'film']",N/A

But then I decided so what if its not true but it made me happy to think that the woman that taught us to believe in love again didn't live her entire life without love. That would have ben more tragic than getting a few facts wrong. Whether Jane and Tom Lefroy were anymore than fliratious it is  nice to imagine maybe they were in love. So I bought it and watched it again and it was perfectly lovely. Anne Hathaway though not my first choice gives a stirring performance as our young Jane Austen. I keenly felt her pain and her joys. The end of the movie, especially with the beautiful score, left me feeling sad but happy that even though Jane didn't marry her Mr. Darcy it didn't necessarily mean she never found him. I did have some reservations about some of the content and would Jane have really done that? It was certainly different from your typical Jane Austen movie. But it reminds us that Jane was also once young and had a heart. But like both Jane and Tom said they tried to do what ""they must."" It was also neat to see how her neighbors and family may have been the inspiration of some of her characters. I thought the title was fitting.

Rather, it is a re-imagining of what Jane Austen's life may have been and how her love life may have shaped her novels.  I'd like to think of ""Becoming Jane"" as 50% fiction and 50% fact.  And if you come to accept it as such, then you will find much to enjoy in this film.I am a Jane Austen fanatic in many ways. I've read and re-read all her books, watched every single adaptation that is available on dvd or video, and even read many so-called 'sequels' based on her novels. Seeing ""Becoming Jane"" was pretty much a given, if only out of curiosity to see what the fuss was all about.And yet despite my initial misgivings, I walked out of the movie as if on a cloud. Sure, I didn't have high expectations for the film but I found ""Becoming Jane"" thoroughly delightful and enjoyable.  For one, the glorious score by Adrian Johnston stayed in my head that I just had to go out and buy the soundtrack. Secondly, I became totally immersed in the love story of Jane Austen and Tom Lefroy, played beautifully by Anne Hathaway and James McAvoy. And lastly, (once I got past the fact that this isn't a biography and just enjoyed it for what it is) I found it to be a wonderful period drama filled with fine acting, beautiful cinematography and an engaging story.The story opens with Jane Austen at home in Hampshire as she attempts to write her first novel. When her brother Henry (Joe Anderson) comes home to visit, he is followed by his friend Tom Lefroy - a young lawyer who is forced by his rich uncle to visit his country relatives as punishment for his troublesome pursuits in London.  It is dislike-at-first-sight for Jane and Tom, but as they get thrown together and learn more about each other, their dislike turns to friendship and then love. Conflicts arise, however, as Tom cannot afford to marry without his uncle's consent and Jane is being pressured to marry wealthy Mr. Wisley (Laurence Fox).  And so Jane and Tom must make the decision whether to marry for money or to marry for love.Anne Hathaway would not have been my first choice to play Jane. In fact, I had British actresses like Sophia Myles and Romola Garai in mind to play my favorite author. My qualms aside, I found Anne to be a creditable Jane Austen and even handled the language and accent (surprisingly) well. James McAvoy was a perfect Tom Lefroy. He infused the character with just the right blend of youthful mischief, sensitivity and charisma that makes him likeable and sympathetic. James and Anne have a chemistry that works and is totally believable. Also excellent are the supporting cast led by Maggie Smith, Julie Walters, James Cromwell, Anna Maxwell Martin (North & South), Lucy Cohu and Laurence Fox (son of actor James Fox).The production values are also excellent. Locations, cinematography, costumes and the screenplay are all topnotch. I am pleased that the  screenwriters remain faithful to the language of the time and did not feel the need to ""dumb it down"" to appeal to modern audiences.  What we get is clever and witty interplay between the characters, and some memorable lines that would make the real Jane proud. Most importantly, watching this was like watching another one of Jane Austen's brilliant novels come to life, and what could be more fulfilling to an Austen fan than that.In my mind, ""Becoming Jane"" is a perfect companion to my other Jane Austen adaptations on dvd.  It is apt perhaps that this will be released towards the end of PBS Masterpiece Theater's ""Complete Jane Austen"" season (and just before Valentine Day - as romantic as it is), so that Jane Austen fans can purchase this dvd along with those of the new versions of ""Northanger Abbey,"" ""Persuasion,"" ""Mansfield Park"" and ""Sense and Sensibility.""  I'm looking forward to owning this on dvd.  It will make a wonderful addition to the dvd library of Regency, romance or British period drama fans and I highly recommend it.",5,"Delightful, charming and romantic..........",1199059200,"12 31, 2007",2007,3998,"['Regardless', 'what', 'others', 'may', 'lead', 'believe', 'Becoming', 'Jane', 'NOT', 'biography', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'Rather', 're-imagining', 'what', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'life', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'how', 'love', 'life', 'may', 'have', 'shaped', 'novels', ""'d"", 'like', 'think', 'Becoming', 'Jane', '50', '%', 'fiction', '50', '%', 'fact', 'come', 'accept', 'such', 'then', 'will', 'find', 'much', 'enjoy', 'film.I', 'am', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'fanatic', 'many', 'ways', ""'ve"", 'read', 're-read', 'books', 'watched', 'single', 'adaptation', 'available', 'dvd', 'video', 'even', 'read', 'many', 'so-called', ""'sequels"", 'based', 'novels', 'Seeing', 'Becoming', 'Jane', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'given', 'only', 'curiosity', 'see', 'what', 'fuss', 'was', 'about.And', 'yet', 'initial', 'misgivings', 'walked', 'movie', 'cloud', 'Sure', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'high', 'expectations', 'film', 'found', 'Becoming', 'Jane', 'thoroughly', 'delightful', 'enjoyable', 'one', 'glorious', 'score', 'Adrian', 'Johnston', 'stayed', 'head', 'just', 'had', 'go', 'out', 'buy', 'soundtrack', 'Secondly', 'became', 'totally', 'immersed', 'love', 'story', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'Tom', 'Lefroy', 'played', 'beautifully', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'lastly', 'once', 'got', 'fact', ""n't"", 'biography', 'just', 'enjoyed', 'what', 'found', 'be', 'wonderful', 'period', 'drama', 'filled', 'fine', 'acting', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'engaging', 'story.The', 'story', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'home', 'Hampshire', 'write', 'first', 'novel', 'When', 'brother', 'Henry', 'Joe', 'Anderson', 'home', 'visit', 'followed', 'friend', 'Tom', 'Lefroy', 'young', 'lawyer', 'who', 'forced', 'rich', 'uncle', 'visit', 'country', 'punishment', 'troublesome', 'pursuits', 'London', 'dislike-at-first-sight', 'Jane', 'Tom', 'get', 'thrown', 'together', 'learn', 'more', 'other', 'dislike', 'friendship', 'then', 'love', 'Conflicts', 'arise', 'however', 'Tom', 'can', 'not', 'afford', 'marry', 'uncle', 'consent', 'Jane', 'being', 'pressured', 'marry', 'wealthy', 'Mr.', 'Wisley', 'Laurence', 'Fox', 'so', 'Jane', 'Tom', 'must', 'make', 'decision', 'marry', 'money', 'marry', 'love.Anne', 'Hathaway', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'first', 'choice', 'play', 'Jane', 'fact', 'had', 'British', 'actresses', 'Sophia', 'Myles', 'Romola', 'Garai', 'mind', 'play', 'favorite', 'author', 'qualms', 'aside', 'found', 'Anne', 'be', 'creditable', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'even', 'handled', 'language', 'accent', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'was', 'perfect', 'Tom', 'Lefroy', 'infused', 'character', 'just', 'right', 'blend', 'youthful', 'mischief', 'sensitivity', 'charisma', 'likeable', 'sympathetic', 'James', 'Anne', 'have', 'chemistry', 'totally', 'believable', 'Also', 'excellent', 'are', 'supporting', 'cast', 'led', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'Julie', 'Walters', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'Anna', 'Maxwell', 'Martin', 'North', 'South', 'Lucy', 'Cohu', 'Laurence', 'Fox', 'son', 'actor', 'James', 'Fox', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'also', 'excellent', 'Locations', 'cinematography', 'costumes', 'screenplay', 'are', 'topnotch', 'am', 'pleased', 'screenwriters', 'remain', 'faithful', 'language', 'time', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'need', 'dumb', 'down', 'appeal', 'modern', 'audiences', 'What', 'get', 'clever', 'witty', 'interplay', 'characters', 'memorable', 'lines', 'would', 'make', 'real', 'Jane', 'proud', 'Most', 'importantly', 'watching', 'was', 'watching', 'one', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'brilliant', 'novels', 'come', 'life', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'fulfilling', 'Austen', 'fan', 'that.In', 'mind', 'Becoming', 'Jane', 'perfect', 'companion', 'other', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'adaptations', 'dvd', 'apt', 'perhaps', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'end', 'PBS', 'Masterpiece', 'Theater', 'Complete', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'season', 'just', 'before', 'Valentine', 'Day', 'as', 'romantic', 'so', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'fans', 'can', 'purchase', 'dvd', 'new', 'versions', 'Northanger', 'Abbey', 'Persuasion', 'Mansfield', 'Park', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'owning', 'dvd', 'will', 'make', 'wonderful', 'addition', 'dvd', 'library', 'Regency', 'romance', 'British', 'period', 'drama', 'fans', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A

Not that it isn't a quality production, but it's very boring.  I'm merely extremely sorry that I purchased it (the library will now have 26 copies!).  The first half of the film is shot in choppy, one to two minute scenes, which isn't helpful since the background of the film isn't established.  You are thrown into Austen's family without any introduction of who is who.  One point is a brother who seems mentally challenged until near the end you discover he is deaf (when Jane does sign language with him, although I wonder if it was invented then?).  The film isn't Austin-esque either.  Within the first few minutes, her parents do some weird sex thing in bed, preparing you for more lewdness later when the ""hero"" is introduced, a young man of low morals, hardly someone we'd expect Jane to find admirable. Yet she falls for him over about twenty minutes of snippy bickering (some of which you can't hear over the loud soundtrack).  I must have fallen asleep at some point, for suddenly she and this man are professing their love for each other.  The man, though, is rather unheroic, the actor being kind of puny and peculiar looking.  In the second half, when Jane is rejected as his fiance, the film gets more interesting as it probes real emotion and character depth, as well as the problems of being poor or nearly so in a money-driven, elitist world -- something that many of us can relate to today.  The only interesting character in the film is Austen's second suitor, who reveals himself as her intellectual and moral equal, giving her a hope of future happiness, since real and mature love is quite a lot of fun, actually.  But he's rejected, as we know from Austen's biographies, in favor of remaining single.  Austen comes off as a little silly in this respect, being willing to run off with a penniless brat while turning away from an established and well-rounded man.  Sad to say, Anne Hathaway's performance as Austen is drab.  She is a fine actress, capable of a great deal more, but I suspect the direction crushed her spirit and talents.  She is most often found writing, and there is a show of her editing habit, which is to cut out words with a pair of scissors, making her letters and manuscripts look like they've gone through CIA censorship.  I believe this is played for laughs but isn't really funny.  This could have been a fine and meaningful film, a depiction of Jane's environment that subsequently became her literature, but I have to say that its potential is never reached.  Instead, the film was worthy of its failure at the box office.

It was a delightful surprise--much more engaging than I expected, despite the staid environment in which Austen lived.  Anne Hathaway is outstanding in the role of Jane, and James McAvoy is terrific as her suitor.  Hathaway plays Jane largely as I imagined her, an independent thinker stuck in a world where it was improper for women to have independent thoughts.  The handsome and dashing McAvoy is not just manly but also quite compelling in his role.  He infuses it with passion and adventure, making every scene that he is in better and every scene without him a disappointment.  Together, Hathaway and McAvoy sizzle.  The period in English history that the story is set in can be considered one of the characters in the movie; it is uptight, ridiculous in some of its conventions, and materialistic in its view of marriage and matches.  While Austen resists fitting into polite sociey for frivolous reasons of social obligation, in the end she finds that her life is to some extent bound by it in spite of her brash independence.

It makes you either want to turn off the TV or fall asleep. The second half picks up enough to at least be able to finish the movie, and the end is somewhat tear jerking. James McAvoy was the only thing I liked about it. He is definitely shines here.The reason I give it a one star:1. The director did a horrible job. It didn't feel professionally done, but more like a collage students first try in directing.2. The acting. Ann Hathaway is beautiful but not a great actress. I was really disappointed by her performance and everyone else's except for McAvoy.3. The music. It was uninspiring and barely noticeable.4. The costumes. They seemed to be made out of polyester and didn't always fit the period. They looked like they were from a costume shop.5. The dialog sucked. It was uninteresting and didn't seem to be from the period. Nothing like the dialog used by Austen in her books.6. The cinematography. They had the beautiful English countryside to work with and it looks like it was filmed in the back yard of a retirement home.The move wasn't at all charming like Austin's novels although that may not have been what they were going for. It didn't capture any cretin style. Not really a romance or a drama film. It was at times crude and vulgar which didn't seem to fit either.

I found myself enjoying it quite a bit.The story purportedly tells of an early, real-life romantic interest of Jane Austen, the author of such English classics as Pride and Prejudice, Emma, and Sense and Sensibility. It reminded me a bit of Shakespeare in Love, as the story tried to illustrate how Austen's personal experiences might have influenced her later works, giving her a rich human tapestry from which to draw her characters. The greater part of the film's story is unsupported by facts (we know very little of Austen's personal life), but presents a picture of what could have happened to a young Jane Austen.Basically, Austen (Hathaway) meets Tom Lefroy (McAvoy), who is studying to be a barrister in London. (He's been sentenced to a month or two in the country by his rich uncle - on whom he depends - for his misbehavior in town.) Of course, the two dislike each other at first, and find only upon further conversation that they have a certain chemistry. It isn't long before Austen is kissing LeFroy with passion, asking him afterwards if she did it well.Of course, complications ensue. Austen is being pressured by her broke family to make a good match, and she has an offer of marriage from a wealthy local young man (and his querulous aunt, played by Maggie Smith). LeFroy hasn't a penny to his name, and he has his own immediate family back in Ireland depending upon him for support. You can see that this doesn't bode well for the two young lovers.Though the movie can be uneven at times, James McAvoy is something to see in this film. I'd never seen him before in an anchor role, and (to be honest) I'd wondered in the past what all the fuss was about him. I don't think he is particularly good looking, he didn't seem super-charismatic in the interviews I'd read, etc. But, then again, I hadn't REALLY seen him act. He is wonderful. By the end of the movie, the viewer is in love with LeFroy more than Austen.An inoffensive movie.

It is wonderful that someone has set out to create a biography about the life of the novelist.  Wonderful cast of actors and period costumes make this film pleasing on many levels.  We get to learn about real Jane Austen and the life she led with her family in English courtyside.  Raised in a household of a minister and his loving wife, with a dotting sister Cassandra, Jane's life is calm and somewhat predictable.  Film starts at her marriageable age, when suitable husband will mark her future.  Many young men are interested in Jane because she is fascinating, witty and talented.  Her father and mother encourage her to accept proposal from the local noble wealthy landowner, an arrangement that would elevate her social status and secure her future.  When a young lawyer (Tom LeFroy) from London arrives to the countryside for a prolonged visit, Jane finds herself smitten by him.  Their romance is doomed, because of the fact that neither of them has money or high social standing and they do not have blessings from their families to marry.  In addition, Jane is a decent human being and she recongnizes early that she cannot build her own happines on her own guilt and other people's misery.  As the lover affair ends suddenly and her marriage prospects dissipate by her own choice(s), Jane finds strength to find herself in her work and creates soem of the most beautiful novels that are calssics today.

1122565,A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB,B000ZIZ0RA,"Sarah ""Eat Dessert First""","[36, 42]","Becoming Jane is the fictionalized account of Jane Austen's (a luminous Anne Hathaway) early years and supposed romance with Thomas Langlois Lefroy (James McAvoy,The Last King of Scotland (Widescreen Edition),Rory O'Shea Was Here). The screenplay was based on real events from the bookBecoming Jane Austenby Jon Spence, who also served as historical consultant to the film.Jane is the younger daughter of Reverend Austen, and the family is in dire financial straits. Jane's older sister Cassandra has just been engaged, and Jane's family desperately wants to find a husband for her due to the family's financial circumstances. However, Jane is headstrong and turns down numerous offers, including Mr. Wisely, the nephew of the demanding Lady Gresham (Maggie Smith). When young Irish lawyer-in-training Thomas Lefroy is sent to Hampshire from London due to his ""unseeming"" conduct, Thomas and Jane begin a flirtatious battle of wit even as Jane struggles to escape the attentions of Wisely. Her first impression is one of Lefroy's arrogance. Throughout this period, Jane continues to work on novels, including Pride and Prejudice (Lefroy was the inspiration for Mr. Darcy).Jane's sister Cassandra suffers a terrible blow, and Jane herself must reassess her chances at future happiness due to the fact that a woman being able to support herself based on writing was virtually unheard-of at the time. Her mother gives her a heartbreaking lecture on marriage that displays how fragile the relationship between marrying for affection (desirable) and marrying for financial solvency (indispensable). Her brother Henry is actively courting a widowed cousin who was married to a French count executed during the French Revolution. Another brother, George, is a deaf-mute (historical records show that Jane mentioned that the two talked using sign language), although he plays a very small role in the story, and I had to research him online since there is no explanation of who he is.My impression of the film was one of disjointedness. One fact that bothered me was the inclusion of a none-too-necessary nude scene featuring Lefroy and Henry stripping down after a cricket game and jumping into the river. Also, several of the subplots could have benefitted from trimming (like the blink-and-you'll-miss-it inclusion of George). The casting was generally quite strong, but I found that McAvoy's Irish accent (which was convincing in Inside I'm Dancing) was fairly eclipsed by a nondescript British one. Many Austenites found fault with the casting of Hathaway, and more specifically, her now you hear it, now you don't English accent. However, her luminous beauty was set off wonderfully by the period costumes, and she lives and breathes the constricting customs of Jane's era with a poised, confident grace. Yes, the accent does falter from time to time, but not enough to be a constant distraction. Maggie Smith is wonderful as the frigid interfering aunt who feels that Jane's family is below her, James Cromwell brought a weathered dignity to his role as Jane's father, and Ian Richardson (who recently passed away) is utterly captivating as the sour uncle on whom Thomas's large family depends.Special mention goes to the cinematography, filmed on location in Ireland, the period costumes by Eimer Ni Mhaoldomhnaigh, and the lush period soundtrack (Becoming Jane) by Adrian Johnston. The DVD contains several deleted scenes, a featurette on Discovering the Real Jane Austen, and pop-up facts and footnotes. Final verdict: although the film is wonderful to look at, it is ultimately a depressing look at Jane's first romantic attraction and of her subsequent fate in life. If you're looking for a feel-good Jane Austen movie, you're better off renting Ang Lee'sSense & Sensibility (Special Edition).",3,Not quite sure what to make of it,1205366400,"03 13, 2008",2008,3797,"['Becoming', 'Jane', 'fictionalized', 'account', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'luminous', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'early', 'years', 'supposed', 'romance', 'Thomas', 'Langlois', 'Lefroy', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'Last', 'King', 'Scotland', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'Rory', ""O'Shea"", 'Was', 'Here', 'screenplay', 'was', 'based', 'real', 'events', 'bookBecoming', 'Jane', 'Austenby', 'Jon', 'Spence', 'who', 'also', 'served', 'historical', 'consultant', 'film.Jane', 'younger', 'daughter', 'Reverend', 'Austen', 'family', 'dire', 'financial', 'straits', 'Jane', 'older', 'sister', 'Cassandra', 'just', 'been', 'engaged', 'Jane', 'family', 'desperately', 'find', 'husband', 'due', 'family', 'financial', 'circumstances', 'However', 'Jane', 'headstrong', 'down', 'numerous', 'offers', 'including', 'Mr', 'Wisely', 'nephew', 'demanding', 'Lady', 'Gresham', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'When', 'young', 'Irish', 'lawyer-in-training', 'Thomas', 'Lefroy', 'sent', 'Hampshire', 'London', 'due', 'unseeming', 'conduct', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'begin', 'flirtatious', 'battle', 'wit', 'even', 'Jane', 'escape', 'attentions', 'Wisely', 'first', 'impression', 'one', 'Lefroy', 'arrogance', 'period', 'Jane', 'work', 'novels', 'including', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'Lefroy', 'was', 'inspiration', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', '.Jane', 'sister', 'Cassandra', 'terrible', 'blow', 'Jane', 'must', 'reassess', 'chances', 'future', 'happiness', 'due', 'fact', 'woman', 'being', 'able', 'support', 'based', 'writing', 'was', 'virtually', 'unheard-of', 'time', 'mother', 'heartbreaking', 'lecture', 'marriage', 'how', 'fragile', 'relationship', 'marrying', 'affection', 'desirable', 'marrying', 'financial', 'solvency', 'indispensable', 'brother', 'Henry', 'actively', 'courting', 'widowed', 'cousin', 'who', 'was', 'married', 'French', 'count', 'executed', 'French', 'Revolution', 'brother', 'George', 'deaf-mute', 'historical', 'records', 'show', 'Jane', 'mentioned', 'two', 'talked', 'using', 'sign', 'language', 'very', 'small', 'role', 'story', 'had', 'research', 'online', 'explanation', 'who', 'impression', 'film', 'was', 'one', 'disjointedness', 'One', 'fact', 'bothered', 'was', 'inclusion', 'none-too-necessary', 'nude', 'scene', 'featuring', 'Lefroy', 'Henry', 'stripping', 'down', 'cricket', 'game', 'jumping', 'river', 'Also', 'several', 'subplots', 'could', 'have', 'benefitted', 'trimming', ""blink-and-you'll-miss-it"", 'inclusion', 'George', 'casting', 'was', 'generally', 'quite', 'strong', 'found', 'McAvoy', 'Irish', 'accent', 'was', 'convincing', 'Inside', ""'m"", 'Dancing', 'was', 'fairly', 'eclipsed', 'nondescript', 'British', 'one', 'Many', 'Austenites', 'found', 'fault', 'casting', 'Hathaway', 'more', 'specifically', 'now', 'hear', 'now', 'do', ""n't"", 'English', 'accent', 'However', 'luminous', 'beauty', 'was', 'set', 'off', 'wonderfully', 'period', 'costumes', 'constricting', 'customs', 'Jane', 'era', 'poised', 'confident', 'grace', 'Yes', 'accent', 'falter', 'time', 'time', 'not', 'enough', 'be', 'constant', 'distraction', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'wonderful', 'frigid', 'interfering', 'aunt', 'who', 'Jane', 'family', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'brought', 'weathered', 'dignity', 'role', 'Jane', 'father', 'Ian', 'Richardson', 'who', 'recently', 'passed', 'away', 'utterly', 'captivating', 'sour', 'uncle', 'whom', 'Thomas', 'large', 'family', 'depends.Special', 'mention', 'cinematography', 'filmed', 'location', 'Ireland', 'period', 'costumes', 'Eimer', 'Ni', 'Mhaoldomhnaigh', 'lush', 'period', 'soundtrack', 'Becoming', 'Jane', 'Adrian', 'Johnston', 'DVD', 'several', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'featurette', 'Discovering', 'Real', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'pop-up', 'facts', 'footnotes', 'Final', 'verdict', 'film', 'wonderful', 'look', 'ultimately', 'depressing', 'look', 'Jane', 'first', 'romantic', 'attraction', 'subsequent', 'fate', 'life', ""'re"", 'looking', 'feel-good', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'movie', ""'re"", 'better', 'off', 'renting', 'Ang', ""Lee'sSense"", 'Sensibility', 'Special', 'Edition']",N/A

1122569,A3GG91QZH5FQJ4,B000ZIZ0RA,S.,"[1, 2]","""Becoming Jane"" is a story of young Jane Austen and her pre-writing days; a story that tells us how this brilliant mind imprisoned by a lack of life experience was set free in some of the best literature in history.  Anne Hathaway is a good choice for Jane, and James McAvoy is a great choice for just about any role.  There is great chemistry between Hathaway and McAvoy, which draws us into this true story of how Jane Austen matured.Jane Austen is a rather popular, educated young woman living in Hampshire, England, deep in the country.  Her father (James Cromwell) is a preacher and he believes that his youngest daughter has a true talent for writing, even though writing was considered an inappropriate profession for women of Austen's time.  Austen's mother (Julie Walters) is more realistic, realizing the sad truth that in order for a woman of limited means, which Jane was, to survive, she needed to marry well.Enter Tom Lefroy (McAvoy), a young lawyer from London, charismatic, decadent and peniless.  Tom dislikes the country and is bored by Jane's amateur writing, which naturally catches Jane's attention, as Tom is seemingly the only men not frothing over her.Great cinematography, great acting, great screenplay - all in all I found ""Becoming Jane"" to be a pleasure to watch.

1122573,A2OCCLHLLWTPLI,B000ZIZ0RA,spacefan,"[3, 3]","The last memorable James McAvoy performance I recall is from The Last King Of Scotland, where he admirably held his own with Oscar winner Forest Whitaker, and turned in a poignant, accomplished delivery.While I wasn't really impressed with Atonement despite all its accolades, I am completely blown away by Becoming Jane, solely because McAvoy is absolutely amazing in this film.Watching it for the first time may not yield any treasures -- for me, it took a 2nd viewing to help me appreciate the movie a lot more -- but I strongly advise you to be patient, and to pay attention to any scene that McAvoy appears in.There're many to choose from, but 3 in particular stand out.At the 55th minute, his character, Tom LeFroy, surprises Jane Austen ( the luminous Anne Hathaway ) at a ball, flashing her a warm yet mischievous smile. The pivotal moment lasts only a couple of seconds, but it's extremely electrifying. ( Makes me wonder whether Hathaway's shy and flustered response was real rather than just acting. )In the last quarter, as LeFroy and Austen sit in a tavern discussing their options for the future, with a disastrous outcome, McAvoy beautifully conveys his character's torment and anguish with masterful aplomb.My favourite bit, however, occurs early in the film -- at the 35th minute, where Austen encounters LeFroy in a library and they engage in some witty repartee. The scene lasts only 3 minutes, but is perfect in its execution. The chemistry between the actors is breath-taking, and McAvoy is rakishly gorgeous. The way he locks Hathaway with his intense, blue-eyed stare is guaranteed to make any woman squirm ( though in a good way :)).I'm a huge fan of the recent Pride & Prejudice remake, but found myself loving this so much more, solely because of McAvoy's astounding performance. His acting chops and charisma more than make up for his diminutive stature.Little wonder then, that this has made him one of my all-time favourite actors, and perhaps my top favourite young actor, period.With the recent rise of similar youthful British thespians in high-profile movies ( Keira Knightley is another star to watch ), I look forward to many more updated versions of literature classics, preferably starring McAvoy as often as possible. :)Apologies for rambling on and on about James.

1122574,A2IG2FG7L85RMU,B000ZIZ0RA,Stanley H. Nemeth,"[8, 14]","As many commentators here have already pointed out, the photography, period settings, costumes, and acting by all the characters in this fictional account of Jane Austen's development as a writer are beyond reproach. The excellence in these areas has garnered what may strike some readers as an excessively generous 4 stars, given the rest of the points to be discussed. The film IS beautiful to look at and entertaining in a Hollywood way, as long as one doesn't take it seriously as biography. Its shortcomings are not in its clothes, but in its soul.First of all, aficionados of Jane Austen, ""the ironic little authoress,"" will probably regard the screenplay with some little ironic smirks of their own. To make Austen and her story attractive to contemporary persons, the writers include an unnecessary, oddly graphic scene of sexual play between Austen's aged parents as well as an instance of unlikely, pre-marital bedroom-sharing between brother Henry and his fiancee Eliza. Here, the writers, seeking to portray universal human nature, just pander instead to current soap opera taste by their inability to lift their focus above the imagined belts of these Regency period characters. Universality, as represented in these instances, is indistinguishable from ""Hollywood, Forever!""More seriously, and far more damaging, the writers present a fictional Jane Austen endowed with much more sensibility than sense. In falling for ""a reckless and penniless"" lawyer, a kind of Restoration rake, she resembles imprudent Marianne Dashwood from ""Sense and Sensibility"" more than the likely Jane Austen avatar, passionate but wise sister Elinor, no doubt deemed by the writers, despite her wit, as too much a moralist for current taste. But a second's thought would surely make it clear that rescuing known drunk and wanton men from their ways doesn't seem to have been in actual life an Austen predilection. As a biographical surmise, it's simply counter-intuitive. Even more telling is the business involving the novel ""Tom Jones. In the film the Lefroy character successfully uses the novel to soften Jane up romantically. What is part of the historical record, unfortunately, is the real Jane Austen's judgment on the Fielding novel. She declared that neither its wit nor its skillful character development ""could atone for the low scale of morals in evidence throughout.""  Further, despite her own clear strictures against the marriage market of her time and its patent unfairness to women of brain and character but small fortune, Austen nevertheless declared that while ""it was wrong to marry for money, it was foolish to marry with none."" Such hard-headedness is evident to readers even in Austen's juvenilia, while it is most assuredly not the hallmark of the Bronte-like character the fetching Anne Hathaway has been called on to portray.Still more damaging, in the attempt to show how ""real"" life lies behind an author's creations, the writers include any number of crude, real-life parallels to events in Austen's works. Though none are as unwittingly hilarious as, say, that old Hollywood classic in which an impoverished and uninspired Beethoven picks up the opening of his Fifth Symphony from his grasping, rent-demanding landlord's continuous rapping at his door, they share with this example a disappointing inability to give due prominence to the large role a fertile imagination usually plays in any great artist's work.The film, again, is certainly worth watching, but it's good to give a wide berth to those who would proclaim that the spirit or character of the real Jane Austen is captured within it.",4,"""Jane Austen Confounded With Marianne Dashwood""",1203552000,"02 21, 2008",2008,3620,"['many', 'commentators', 'here', 'have', 'already', 'pointed', 'out', 'photography', 'period', 'settings', 'costumes', 'acting', 'characters', 'fictional', 'account', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'development', 'writer', 'are', 'reproach', 'excellence', 'areas', 'garnered', 'what', 'may', 'strike', 'readers', 'excessively', 'generous', '4', 'stars', 'given', 'rest', 'points', 'be', 'discussed', 'film', 'IS', 'beautiful', 'look', 'entertaining', 'Hollywood', 'way', 'as', 'long', 'one', ""n't"", 'take', 'seriously', 'biography', 'shortcomings', 'are', 'not', 'clothes', 'soul.First', 'aficionados', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'ironic', 'little', 'authoress', 'will', 'probably', 'regard', 'screenplay', 'little', 'ironic', 'smirks', 'own', 'make', 'Austen', 'story', 'attractive', 'contemporary', 'persons', 'writers', 'include', 'unnecessary', 'oddly', 'graphic', 'scene', 'sexual', 'play', 'Austen', 'aged', 'parents', 'as', 'well', 'instance', 'unlikely', 'pre-marital', 'bedroom-sharing', 'brother', 'Henry', 'fiancee', 'Eliza', 'Here', 'writers', 'seeking', 'portray', 'universal', 'human', 'nature', 'just', 'pander', 'instead', 'current', 'soap', 'opera', 'taste', 'inability', 'lift', 'focus', 'imagined', 'belts', 'Regency', 'period', 'characters', 'Universality', 'represented', 'instances', 'indistinguishable', 'Hollywood', 'Forever', 'More', 'seriously', 'far', 'more', 'damaging', 'writers', 'present', 'fictional', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'endowed', 'much', 'more', 'sensibility', 'sense', 'falling', 'reckless', 'penniless', 'lawyer', 'kind', 'Restoration', 'rake', 'imprudent', 'Marianne', 'Dashwood', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'more', 'likely', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'avatar', 'passionate', 'wise', 'sister', 'Elinor', 'doubt', 'deemed', 'writers', 'wit', 'too', 'much', 'moralist', 'current', 'taste', 'second', 'thought', 'would', 'surely', 'make', 'clear', 'rescuing', 'known', 'drunk', 'wanton', 'men', 'ways', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'actual', 'life', 'Austen', 'predilection', 'biographical', 'surmise', 'simply', 'counter-intuitive', 'Even', 'more', 'telling', 'business', 'involving', 'novel', 'Tom', 'Jones', 'film', 'Lefroy', 'character', 'successfully', 'novel', 'soften', 'Jane', 'up', 'romantically', 'What', 'part', 'historical', 'record', 'unfortunately', 'real', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'judgment', 'Fielding', 'novel', 'declared', 'wit', 'skillful', 'character', 'development', 'could', 'atone', 'low', 'scale', 'morals', 'evidence', 'Further', 'own', 'clear', 'strictures', 'marriage', 'market', 'time', 'patent', 'unfairness', 'women', 'brain', 'character', 'small', 'fortune', 'Austen', 'nevertheless', 'declared', 'was', 'wrong', 'marry', 'money', 'was', 'foolish', 'marry', 'none', 'Such', 'hard-headedness', 'evident', 'readers', 'even', 'Austen', 'juvenilia', 'most', 'assuredly', 'not', 'hallmark', 'Bronte-like', 'character', 'fetching', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'been', 'called', 'portray.Still', 'more', 'damaging', 'attempt', 'show', 'how', 'real', 'life', 'author', 'creations', 'writers', 'include', 'number', 'crude', 'real-life', 'parallels', 'events', 'Austen', 'works', 'none', 'are', 'unwittingly', 'hilarious', 'say', 'old', 'Hollywood', 'classic', 'impoverished', 'uninspired', 'Beethoven', 'up', 'opening', 'Fifth', 'Symphony', 'grasping', 'rent-demanding', 'landlord', 'continuous', 'rapping', 'door', 'share', 'example', 'disappointing', 'inability', 'give', 'due', 'prominence', 'large', 'role', 'fertile', 'imagination', 'usually', 'great', 'artist', 'work.The', 'film', 'again', 'certainly', 'worth', 'watching', 'good', 'give', 'wide', 'berth', 'who', 'would', 'proclaim', 'spirit', 'character', 'real', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'captured']",N/A

That being the case, I didn't have the case to read to see about what extra features and bonus material might be on the disc.  Personally I am a bonus material lover and will dig into discs to see what bonus content is there when possible.  Many times I'll let the presence or absence of bonus materials help me decide if a disc is worth a purchase or if should be strictly a rental for me.In the case of Becoming Jane, I somewhat correctly assumed that the film was going to be aimed more at my spouse than myself.  She has been a fan of Jane Austen and other great female authors, so it was a rather safe assumption that she'd enjoy the film.  In my case, I thought it would be tolerable enough to sit and watch for a date nite that just happens to land very near to Valentines day 2008.Now, I mention the bonus features first thing above because there are some interesting features available to watch that answer some of the questions my wife was asking as we watched together.  What time period was the story covering, how long were the distances from point A to point B, etc., and other interesting tidbits are covered in a pop-up feature that can be enabled in the special features area.  Had I known in advance that the feature was available, I would have turned it on immediately, despite some concern from my wife that the pop-ups would obscure the film too much or be too distracting.From the sampling we did after the fact (we watched just a few of the pop-ups as we went back to rewatch a few chapters and see how prevalent the pop-ups were and how they worked *after watching the main feature and not realizing the pop-up feature was available in advance*) I'd have to give credit to the way the pop-ups were done.  Not too frequent, and not too distracting at all.  And, as they should be, informative and educational.Unfortunately though, there are a few distractions here for me and they leave me marking the film down slightly (into the 3.5 - 4 star range if I could be more precise).  First, please note that I tend to watch films with the English subtitles for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing on.  Though neither my wife nor myself are deaf or really that hard of hearing, there are times we miss dialog and seeing the subtitles can help tell us what we missed.  If we don't use the subtitles we tend to have to turn the volume up far too much and then when volume levels invariably fluctuate we get blasted out of the room by loud noises, shouts, cries, etc.  In the case of Becoming Jane, the subtitles are fairly true to the dialog, but there are times when it was obvious to me that the subtitles weren't paced in the same manner as the dialog that was being spoken.  Little subtleties in the pacing of conversation were lost when reading the subtitles, and it changed things somewhat from the spoken words one hears in watching the film.  I'm reminded of deaf friends and the challenges they face in watching films, TV shows and the like, and feel a bit frustrated in knowing that they could be missing things because of the difference in how things are conveyed in written word versus spoken word, at least when the written word doesn't include indications of pauses or perhaps overlapping conversation.Another distraction for me was in the spoken word in the film and the lack of accent that I would expect from people living in England or Ireland.  Becoming Jane seemed to be almost completely bereft of accents for any of the major players which just seemed off to me as I think about the film that I watched.  While it wasn't distracting while watching, as I sit and think about the film now, it strikes me something that is missing.The final distraction for me, a fairly inevitable one, is having seen various adaptations of the story of Miss Austen or her characters (which parallel her own life in manners similar to say the film Shakespeare in Love) that have been shown repeatedly on say PBS or A&E; and other outlets.  From those characters and the actors and actresses that portrayed them one might have a certain expectation and anctipation of events in Becoming Jane that are inevitable and inescapable.  Not necessarily a bad thing, and really not overly distracting, just something that you can't help but think of as you watch this particular film and think of similar materials you've seen elsewhere.Becoming Jane is a good film, perhaps aimed much more at female audiences than male, but enjoyable enough for a family to sit and watch.  The film is rated PG.  Running time of nearly 2 hours, but certainly not dragged out.  Perhaps a bit too rushed in some spots, such that viewers may wonder how much time has passed between some events that are shown in the film, but I suspect that the lack of a clear timeline as you go wasn't so much as intentional but more a fault of making a film that covers a greater passage of time fit into a time frame that won't leave viewers tired of sitting still too long.As some point I'll likely purchase a copy of the film for my daughter to watch, and as my wife suggested, it's the kind of movie that my AARP set mother would also very much enjoy (which basically equates to me saying this is a movie that would appeal to a wide spectrum of ages).",4,"Interesting, with a few minor nits to pick, and a feature I wish I'd known about",1202860800,"02 13, 2008",2008,5333,"['First', 'up',

1122587,A1RNMPOY4XIAA8,B000ZIZ0RA,Tristan,"[2, 6]","I really must point out that the generous rating is only there because of the beautifully enchanting opening sequence and simply perfect ending. Unfortunately the rest of the film was not exhilarating.It is a fictional story of the life of Jane Austen one of the world's most beloved authors having written six best selling novels. There is not much difference to the story than one of the many, many films adaptations of her actual books. It follows the basic premise of Pride and Prejudice with an overly impertinent mother desperate to marry off her daughter Jane to a wealthy man. It is even more similar when Jane refuses a generous offer from one such man, and tension with her mother ensues. Jane meets a man, Tom Lefroy, who is young, attractive, and different most of the stiff and proper men she is surrounded by. As she falls for him and he for her...well you probably already know...they are unable to marry because Tom does not have any money. He is completely reliable on his Uncle's allowance for support, an allowance that will be taken away should he marry Jane. As they try to figure a way to marry and be financially stable a secret is revealed and the story comes to surprising conclusion.I am sure Jane's life was an inspiration for her novels but this fictitious tale seemed to similar to the umpteen adaptations we have seen of her stories to make it interesting enough. Also the film is called `Becoming Jane', I assume meaning Jane Austen becoming a famous author, but I felt like the story never really showed much of her writing and coming up with the ideas. There were occasions that this did happen but not enough for my taste.One enjoyable thing, like all Jane Austen movies, is the locations and scenery are always breathtaking and a pleasure to watch.Anne Hathaway plays the young author very convincingly, and James McAvoy plays Tom Lefroy with an intense captivating energy. The wonderful supporting actors, which include Maggie Smith, Julie Waters, and James Cromwell, all do wonderful jobs but are heavily underused.Overall a movie that uses the same things over again too many times. I still am sticking to my original rating because of the ending which is just so remarkable and also the skillfully timed and edited beginning.",3,"What is Jane ""becoming""?",1202256000,"02 6, 2008",2008,2264,"['really', 'must', 'point', 'out', 'generous', 'rating', 'only', 'there', 'beautifully', 'enchanting', 'opening', 'sequence', 'simply', 'perfect', 'ending', 'Unfortunately', 'rest', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'exhilarating.It', 'fictional', 'story', 'life', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'one', 'world', 'most', 'beloved', 'authors', 'having', 'written', 'six', 'best', 'selling', 'novels', 'not', 'much', 'difference', 'story', 'one', 'many', 'many', 'films', 'adaptations', 'actual', 'books', 'basic', 'premise', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'overly', 'impertinent', 'mother', 'desperate', 'marry', 'off', 'daughter', 'Jane', 'wealthy', 'man', 'even', 'more', 'similar', 'when', 'Jane', 'generous', 'offer', 'one', 'such', 'man', 'tension', 'mother', 'ensues', 'Jane', 'man', 'Tom', 'Lefroy', 'who', 'young', 'attractive', 'different', 'most', 'stiff', 'proper', 'men', 'surrounded', 'well', 'probably', 'already', 'know', 'are', 'unable', 'marry', 'Tom', 'not', 'have', 'money', 'completely', 'reliable', 'Uncle', 'allowance', 'support', 'allowance', 'will', 'be', 'taken', 'away', 'should', 'marry', 'Jane', 'try', 'figure', 'way', 'marry', 'be', 'financially', 'stable', 'secret', 'revealed', 'story', 'surprising', 'conclusion.I', 'am', 'sure', 'Jane', 'life', 'was', 'inspiration', 'novels', 'fictitious', 'tale', 'seemed', 'similar', 'umpteen', 'adaptations', 'have', 'seen', 'stories', 'make', 'interesting', 'enough', 'Also', 'film', 'called', 'Becoming', 'Jane', 'assume', 'meaning', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'becoming', 'famous', 'author', 'felt', 'story', 'never', 'really', 'showed', 'much', 'writing', 'coming', 'up', 'ideas', 'were', 'occasions', 'did', 'happen', 'not', 'enough', 'taste.One', 'enjoyable', 'thing', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'movies', 'locations', 'scenery', 'are', 'always', 'breathtaking', 'pleasure', 'watch.Anne', 'Hathaway', 'young', 'author', 'very', 'convincingly', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'Tom', 'Lefroy', 'intense', 'captivating', 'energy', 'wonderful', 'supporting', 'actors', 'include', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'Julie', 'Waters', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'do', 'wonderful', 'jobs', 'are', 'heavily', 'underused.Overall', 'movie', 'same', 'things', 'again', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'still', 'am', 'sticking', 'original', 'rating', 'ending', 'just', 'so', 'remarkable', 'also', 'skillfully', 'timed', 'edited', 'beginning']",N/A
1122588,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000ZIZ0RA,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 2]","In ""Becoming Jane"" Anne Hathaway (""The Devil Wears Prada"") plays Jane Austen before she became a famous novelist. Though the film is based on a book ""Becoming Jane Austen"" written by Jon Spence, this is in no way a biography as you can see from its highly melodramatic storyline. ""Becoming Jane"" is not so much like a historically accurate bio-pic as a romance in the vein of ""Shakespeare in Love.""In fact, ""Becoming Jane"" gives an impression that the script has borrowed much from the novelist's most famous work, ""Pride and Prejudice."" Young and vivacious Jane Austen meets a handsome Irish apprentice lawyer Tom Lefroy (played by James McAvoy, ""The Last King of Scotland""). They dislike each other before falling in love, only to realize the reality of their situations. These bitter-sweet moments of life, the film suggests, have played a vital role for young Jane Austen in writing her masterpieces, or becoming Jane.In the film Tom Lefroy says to Jane Austen: ""Experience is vital."" Interestingly, a similar idea was once used in ""Shakespeare in Love,"" in which the young dramatist falls in love with beautiful Viola, and his experiences become the basis of ""Romeo and Juliet"" and ""Twelfth Night."" We see the same patterns in ""Becoming Jane"" (besides the fact that both movies star an American as heroine). As Christopher Marlow gives advice to Will Shakespeare in ""Shakespeare in Love,"" so does Mrs. Radcliffe (Helen McCrory) to the aspiring novelist in ""becoming Jane.""The biggest difference is that the Oscar-winning film has a group of fleshed out, memorable characters like Judi Dench's Queen Elizabeth. Actually the leading stars of ""Becoming Jane"" are very good and there is considerable chemistry between them, but the characters they play are not as good as their performances. Director Julian Jarrold heavily relies on the cast including Maggie Smith, Julie Walters and James Cromwell, but even these talented actors are wasted in the story that Jane Austen would have parodied as she did in ""Northanger Abbey.""",3,Jane Austen in Love,1262995200,"01 9, 2010",2010,2027,"['Becoming', 'Jane', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'Devil', 'Wears', 'Prada', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'became', 'famous', 'novelist', 'film', 'based', 'book', 'Becoming', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'written', 'Jon', 'Spence', 'way', 'biography', 'can', 'see', 'highly', 'melodramatic', 'storyline', 'Becoming', 'Jane', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'historically', 'accurate', 'bio-pic', 'romance', 'vein', 'Shakespeare', 'Love', 'fact', 'Becoming', 'Jane', 'impression', 'script', 'borrowed', 'much', 'novelist', 'most', 'famous', 'work', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'Young', 'vivacious', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'handsome', 'Irish', 'apprentice', 'lawyer', 'Tom', 'Lefroy', 'played', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'Last', 'King', 'Scotland', 'dislike', 'other', 'falling', 'love', 'only', 'realize', 'reality', 'situations', 'bitter-sweet', 'moments', 'life', 'film', 'have', 'played', 'vital', 'role', 'young', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'writing', 'masterpieces', 'becoming', 'Jane.In', 'film', 'Tom', 'Lefroy', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'Experience', 'vital', 'Interestingly', 'similar', 'idea', 'was', 'once', 'used', 'Shakespeare', 'Love', 'young', 'dramatist', 'love', 'beautiful', 'Viola', 'experiences', 'become', 'basis', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'Twelfth', 'Night', 'see', 'same', 'patterns', 'Becoming', 'Jane', 'fact', 'movies', 'star', 'American', 'heroine', 'Christopher', 'Marlow', 'advice', 'Will', 'Shakespeare', 'Shakespeare', 'Love', 'so', 'Mrs.', 'Radcliffe', 'Helen', 'McCrory', 'aspiring', 'novelist', 'becoming', 'Jane', 'biggest', 'difference', 'Oscar-winning', 'film', 'group', 'fleshed', 'out', 'memorable', 'characters', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'Actually', 'leading', 'stars', 'Becoming', 'Jane', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'considerable', 'chemistry', 'characters', 'play', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'performances', 'Director', 'Julian', 'Jarrold', 'heavily', 'cast', 'including', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'Julie', 'Walters', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'even', 'talented', 'actors', 'are', 'wasted', 'story', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'would', 'have', 'parodied', 'did', 'Northanger', 'Abbey']",N/A

However, what did take me by surprise was how much I enjoyed the journey!While not much is known about Jane Austen's life, the movie makers have filled in the gaps between the facts.  Anyone that is a fan of Jane Austen would agree that while on the surface her life seems somewhat uneventful, to write about such emotion proves to her fans that all was not as it seemed on the outside.Anne Hathaway does a fine job of bringing Austen to life.  James McAvoyn is amazing!  This was the first film I had seen him in and was blown away with his talent.  He can convey so much emotion with his eyes alone.  The other cast member were equally impressive (Julie Walters, Maggie Smith & James Cromwell). The production sets, especially the Austen's home seemed realistic enough.  The plot kept me guessing as to how they were going to give the story the correct ending (WARNING SPOILER!) without having the audience hate Tom Lefroy!  I thought the movie was a create way of portraying what might have happened in Jane's life to get her creative juices going, but at the same time trying to keep the historical facts intact.  The only thing preventing me giving the movie a 5 star rating is the ending. I would have loved a more happily ever after ending but as quoted in the movie, not always does good things happen to good people.",4,NIcely Done,1202947200,"02 14, 2008",2008,1489,"['Having', 'read', 'Jon', 'Spence', 'Becoming', 'Jane', 'author', 'life', 'how', 'cases', 'related', 'author', 'work', 'certainly', 'knew', 'how', 'story', 'would', 'end', 'However', 'what', 'did', 'take', 'surprise', 'was', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'journey', 'not', 'much', 'known', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'life', 'movie', 'makers', 'have', 'filled', 'gaps', 'facts', 'Anyone', 'fan', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'would', 'agree', 'surface', 'life', 'somewhat', 'uneventful', 'write', 'such', 'emotion', 'proves', 'fans', 'was', 'not', 'seemed', 'outside.Anne', 'Hathaway', 'fine', 'job', 'bringing', 'Austen', 'life', 'James', 'McAvoyn', 'amazing', 'was', 'first', 'film', 'had', 'seen', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'talent', 'can', 'convey', 'so', 'much', 'emotion', 'eyes', 'alone', 'other', 'cast', 'member', 'were', 'equally', 'impressive', 'Julie', 'Walters', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'production', 'sets', 'especially', 'Austen', 'home', 'seemed', 'realistic', 'enough', 'plot', 'kept', 'guessing', 'how', 'were', 'going', 'give', 'story', 'correct', 'ending', 'WARNING', 'SPOILER', 'having', 'audience', 'hate', 'Tom', 'Lefroy', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'create', 'way', 'portraying', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'happened', 'Jane', 'life', 'get', 'creative', 'juices', 'going', 'same', 'time', 'trying', 'keep', 'historical', 'facts', 'intact', 'only', 'thing', 'preventing', 'giving', 'movie', '5', 'star', 'rating', 'ending', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'more', 'happily', 'ever', 'ending', 'quoted', 'movie', 'not', 'always', 'good', 'things', 'happen', 'good', 'people']",N/A
