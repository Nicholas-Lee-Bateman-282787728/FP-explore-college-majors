EVERYTHING is better. The storylines, the writing, the directing, the acting, the freakin' SPECIAL EFFECTS (horrid in season one, passable in season two), everything.My favorite storylines of season two are the budding romance between Arthur and Gwen, which was rushed at first but soon smoothed out into a love story for the ages, and Morgana discovering her powers and starting down the path to darkness and badassery.Season two also introduces the mysterious witch Morgause, who quickly became one of my favorite characters. Her relationship with Morgana is truly beautiful. This season also features Charles Dance in tight black leather (!) as the Child Catcher-inspired Witchfinder Aredian, the captivating Joseph Mawle as the equally captivating warlock Alvarr (I know he was just a guest character, but God I want him to return) and the return of Asa Butterfield as the ""evil little munchkin"" Mordred, aka He of the Unimaginably Creepy Eyes.

1338489,AQZH7YTWQPOBE,B003ES5JII,Enjolras,"[0, 0]","Merlin seems like an attempt to build off the success of Harry Potter - a TV show about teenage wizards and princes. The series is loosely based on the legend of King Arthur and Merlin in Camelot. I say loosely because it is essentially about the adventures of young Arthur and Merlin. Each episode, the two get into trouble, very much like the early Harry Potter books. However, this show has a lot more spirit than the over-produced Harry Potter movies.What I really appreciate about the show is its maturity, despite its focus on younger characters. The humor is (generally) not slapstick humor, but rather in emphasizing the absurdity of the situations Arthur and Merlin find themselves in. The show gets dark at times and doesn't shy away from death, but also keeps it in good taste - unlike HBO's Game of Thrones, which seems to delight in bloodshed.Merlin also develops its characters, something very hard to do on a TV show. Most TV shows tend to focus on the ""threat of the week"" and rush over character development. It's not uncommon for the characters to remain the same throughout. However, Merlin's characters do have their respective journeys. Arthur in particular goes from callous knight to mature ruler with a sense of responsibility. The show also treats the other characters subtly with few heroes and villains. I especially appreciate how Uther Pendragon is never portrayed as simply a villain, but rather a king with heavy emotional and political burdens to bear.Moreover, Merlin stays true to the atmosphere of the Middle-Ages, with a few obvious deviations. I'm not a historian, but do read a lot of history and there isn't too much I've noticed wrong with the historical details of the era. Although given that it's based on the fictional kingdom of Camelot some liberties are expected. Given that this is a TV show, I'm actually quite impressed with the attention to detail in the sets and clothing.The second season is even better than the first. It really pushes the characters farther and into deeper emotional territory. Characters are forced to make more difficult decisions. We see more of the recurring characters like Morgause and Mordred. Can't wait to see what Season 3 holds.Overall, if you like Harry Potter, definitely check this show out.",5,Like Harry Potter - but better,1343692800,"07 31, 2012",2012,2277,"['Merlin', 'attempt', 'build', 'off', 'success', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'TV', 'show', 'teenage', 'wizards', 'princes', 'series', 'loosely', 'based', 'legend', 'King', 'Arthur', 'Merlin', 'Camelot', 'say', 'loosely', 'essentially', 'adventures', 'young', 'Arthur', 'Merlin', 'episode', 'two', 'get', 'trouble', 'very', 'much', 'early', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'books', 'However', 'show', 'lot', 'more', 'spirit', 'over-produced', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'movies.What', 'really', 'appreciate', 'show', 'maturity', 'focus', 'younger', 'characters', 'humor', 'generally', 'not', 'slapstick', 'humor', 'rather', 'emphasizing', 'absurdity', 'situations', 'Arthur', 'Merlin', 'find', 'show', 'dark', 'times', ""n't"", 'shy', 'away', 'death', 'also', 'good', 'taste', 'HBO', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'delight', 'bloodshed.Merlin', 'also', 'characters', 'something', 'very', 'hard', 'do', 'TV', 'show', 'Most', 'TV', 'shows', 'tend', 'focus', 'threat', 'week', 'rush', 'over', 'character', 'development', 'not', 'uncommon', 'characters', 'remain', 'same', 'However', 'Merlin', 'characters', 'do', 'have', 'respective', 'journeys', 'Arthur', 'particular', 'callous', 'knight', 'mature', 'ruler', 'sense', 'responsibility', 'show', 'also', 'other', 'characters', 'subtly', 'few', 'heroes', 'villains', 'especially', 'appreciate', 'how', 'Uther', 'Pendragon', 'never', 'portrayed', 'simply', 'villain', 'rather', 'king', 'heavy', 'emotional', 'political', 'burdens', 'bear.Moreover', 'Merlin', 'true', 'atmosphere', 'Middle-Ages', 'few', 'obvious', 'deviations', ""'m"", 'not', 'historian', 'do', 'read', 'lot', 'history', ""n't"", 'too', 'much', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'wrong', 'historical', 'details', 'era', 'given', 'based', 'fictional', 'kingdom', 'Camelot', 'liberties', 'are', 'expected', 'Given', 'TV', 'show', ""'m"", 'actually', 'quite', 'impressed', 'attention', 'detail', 'sets', 'clothing.The', 'second', 'season', 'even', 'better', 'first', 'really', 'characters', 'farther', 'deeper', 'emotional', 'territory', 'Characters', 'are', 'forced', 'make', 'more', 'difficult', 'decisions', 'see', 'more', 'recurring', 'characters', 'Morgause', 'Mordred', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'what', 'Season', '3', 'holds.Overall', 'like', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'definitely', 'check', 'show', 'out']",N/A

""Kimberly""","[3, 3]",I love this show and I was excited to see it FINALLY come to the USA on BBC America/The Scfy Channel(the show is available for instant stream on Netflix-btw). I won't speak about the content of the show- because far better professional TV and Sci-fi reviewers have already reviewed this product... and I  agree whole-heartedly the second season clearly exceeded its preceding season- bringing Arthur's relationships into full focus- showcasing dynamics in the relationships Arthur has with Merlin and Gwen that will make him want to build a much fairer and just Camelot. YES- you should definitely purchase this season via iTunes or check out the instant streams on Netflix because they are definitely worth your time!However I have a warning- this is the second time I've purchased a Channel One/BBC product from an Amazon seller at a discounted price. While the item arrived in a somewhat speedy fashion- it is clear that the DVDs sold to me were pirated- that the box condition and the condition of the covers of the DVDs are fakes.While it was a 'well-designed' pirated copy... it isn't what I intended to purchase. I was hoping to purchase a genuine copy of the show at a lower price. I don't appreciate being lied too- by sellers and I certainly don't like paying $17 for a PIRATED copy of a TV show.My seller- was highly recommended for his prices and the speediness of his sales- and I'm assuming he has been misinforming buyers for a long time by using words like 'new' and 'mint-condition' -still sealed(it is clear he used a shrink wrap machine to wrap this pitiful attempt at a box set).In these tough economic times- we have to save money any way we can(especially-students who are dealing with higher tution costs). But we also have a responsibility to be honest and loyal to the networks who produce the shows we love- with much tighter budgets. I'd much rather make Channel One/The BBC richer so they can produce more quality programming than have my money go towards benefiting a stranger- who is misinforming/manipulating buyers to purchase their product.Amazon needs to be aware of sellers who are using the downfall of the economy to sell pirated movies/televisions to users at discounted prices. If a price on a product sounds too-good to be true it most likely is... Amazon I fear will soon come under attack by companies like the BBC and other networks for allowing sellers to sell pirated copyrighted material.If you're like me and you like the material you purchase to be high quality and authentic- particularly when it concerns all things Merlin purchase the episodes from iTunes or from Amazon directly- and don't deal with crooked sellers who are merely in it for their self-interest.,5,Merlin/BBC Fans A WARNING about Amazon,1313971200,"08 22, 2011",2011,2713,"['love', 'show', 'was', 'excited', 'see', 'FINALLY', 'come', 'USA', 'BBC', 'America/The', 'Scfy', 'Channel', 'show', 'available', 'instant', 'stream', 'Netflix-btw', 'wo', ""n't"", 'speak', 'content', 'show-', 'far', 'better', 'professional', 'TV', 'Sci-fi', 'reviewers', 'have', 'already', 'reviewed', 'product', 'agree', 'whole-heartedly', 'second', 'season', 'clearly', 'exceeded', 'preceding', 'season-', 'bringing', 'Arthur', 'relationships', 'full', 'focus-', 'showcasing', 'dynamics', 'relationships', 'Arthur', 'Merlin', 'Gwen', 'will', 'make', 'want', 'build', 'much', 'fairer', 'just', 'Camelot', 'YES-', 'should', 'definitely', 'purchase', 'season', 'iTunes', 'check', 'out', 'instant', 'streams', 'Netflix', 'are', 'definitely', 'time', 'However', 'have', 'warning-', 'second', 'time', ""'ve"", 'purchased', 'Channel', 'One/BBC', 'product', 'Amazon', 'seller', 'discounted', 'price', 'item', 'arrived', 'somewhat', 'speedy', 'fashion-', 'clear', 'DVDs', 'sold', 'were', 'pirated-', 'box', 'condition', 'condition', 'covers', 'DVDs', 'are', 'fakes.While', 'was', ""'well-designed"", 'pirated', 'copy', ""n't"", 'what', 'intended', 'purchase', 'was', 'hoping', 'purchase', 'genuine', 'copy', 'show', 'lower', 'price', 'do', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'being', 'lied', 'too-', 'sellers', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'paying', '17', 'PIRATED', 'copy', 'TV', 'show.My', 'seller-', 'was', 'highly', 'recommended', 'prices', 'speediness', 'sales-', ""'m"", 'assuming', 'been', 'misinforming', 'buyers', 'long', 'time', 'using', 'words', ""'new"", ""'mint-condition"", '-still', 'sealed', 'clear', 'used', 'shrink', 'wrap', 'machine', 'wrap', 'pitiful', 'attempt', 'box', 'set', 'tough', 'economic', 'times-', 'have', 'save', 'money', 'way', 'can', 'especially-students', 'who', 'are', 'dealing', 'higher', 'tution', 'costs', 'also', 'have', 'responsibility', 'be', 'honest', 'loyal', 'networks', 'who', 'produce', 'shows', 'love-', 'much', 'tighter', 'budgets', ""'d"", 'much', 'rather', 'make', 'Channel', 'One/The', 'BBC', 'so', 'can', 'produce', 'more', 'quality', 'programming', 'have', 'money', 'go', 'towards', 'benefiting', 'stranger-', 'who', 'misinforming/manipulating', 'buyers', 'purchase', 'product.Amazon', 'be', 'aware', 'sellers', 'who', 'are', 'using', 'downfall', 'economy', 'sell', 'pirated', 'movies/televisions', 'users', 'discounted', 'prices', 'price', 'product', 'too-good', 'be', 'true', 'most', 'likely', 'Amazon', 'fear', 'will', 'soon', 'come', 'attack', 'companies', 'BBC', 'other', 'networks', 'allowing', 'sellers', 'sell', 'pirated', 'copyrighted', 'material.If', ""'re"", 'like', 'material', 'purchase', 'be', 'high', 'quality', 'authentic-', 'particularly', 'when', 'things', 'Merlin', 'purchase', 'episodes', 'iTunes', 'Amazon', 'directly-', 'do', ""n't"", 'deal', 'crooked', 'sellers', 'who', 'are', 'merely', 'self-interest']",N/A

Season Two was equally delightful, and I am pleased to see that it has finally been released on DVD in the U.S. (A DVD set for Season Three will follow shortly, I hope.) ""Merlin"" is an entertaining series whose pluses overcome its shortcomings. In spite of occasionally silly plots and/or heavy-handed or predictable dialogue, not to mention its flagrant disregard for the traditional Arthurian canon, it is a joy to watch - primarily because of the lovely chemistry of its actors and the charm of the mostly youthful cast.Colin Morgan (Merlin) and Bradley James (Prince Arthur) continue to entertain us with their humorous banter, their very real acting skills, and their visual appeal. Morgan's Merlin, a gawky youth with an elfin face (and ears) and an interesting, offbeat beauty, is still burdened with the secret of his magical powers (magic having been banned in Camelot by Arthur's father, King Uther Pendragon). As manservant to the arrogant, if courageous and essentially good-hearted Arthur, he must deal with the prince's frequent prattishness and verbal abuse (""Mer-lin, you idiot!""), yet save his life in practically every episode. Morgan gives the young warlock an endearing awkwardness and gentle sensitivity combined with a fierce determination to protect the crown prince from whatever monster or villainous sorcerer happens to be passing through Camelot each week. Arthur, one of the handsomest twenty-something blonds-in-armor you could ever hope to meet, is nicely played by James with just the right amount of swagger, bravado (combined with hidden insecurities), and an excellent sense of comic timing. Katie McGrath, as King Uther's ward, the beautiful and conflicted Morgana, and Angel Coulby as Guinevere (Morgana's maidservant in this alternative Arthurian universe), provide the only feminine element in what is essentially a man's world of knights and squires and clanking armor. Guest performers include Emilia Fox as the mysterious Morgause, Mackenzie Crook as a thief who becomes possessed by the spirit of an evil wizard, Sarah Parish as a lovely noblewoman who is really a troll in disguise, Santiago Cabrera as that honorable warrior-hunk, Lancelot, Laura Donnelly as Merlin's fleeting love interest, young Asa Butterfield as the child Mordred, and John Lynch as a long-banished Dragonlord who may have closer ties to Merlin than a mere similarity of magical gifts.The regular cast members of the older generation - Anthony Head as King Uther (who tries to do right by his kingdom, but fears and despises anybody gifted with magic), Richard Wilson as Gaius, the court physician and Merlin's friend and guardian, and John Hurt, who provides the voice of the Great Dragon - are as good as they were during the first season, and provide a nice foil to the lively enthusiasm of the junior performers. A welcome addition to the latter group is Rupert Young as Sir Leon, one of the most dedicated of the younger knights. I'll not provide any spoilers for Season 3 (coming soon to DVD, I hope?) except to say that the future adventures of our young heroes involve yet another horde of magical creatures, a former friend turning enemy, and the first references to a certain famous table of circular shape.Note: Season 2 of ""Merlin"" was broadcast in the U.S. on the Syfy channel; however, due to the time required for commercial breaks, scenes were cut from the BBC episodes, including one major scene from the final episode of the season.

How well is the set made?  How well will it hold up over time?  That's easy to predict - Not very well.What you get is a multi-disc holder that is designed cheaply to save room.  I got Season 1 and 2.  One of the packs came with a disc flopping around inside the packaging because the cheap ""clip"" won't hold the disc in place.  They substituted a full-sized round DVD clip with a half-shaped clip to save room in the package and allow the discs to overlap.  I have other sets like this.  The clips will eventually break over time, with enough use.  And mine came with one already broken and a disc scratched on back from it.Similarly, the cardboard outer sleeve is cheap and was already scraped up at the edges when I got it, just from the factory trying to insert the discs into the package.  Both sets I ordered were like this.  When I took the discs out and then went to re-insert them, they get caught on the inner flap/fold of the outside package.

A casting coupe in John Hurt as the voice of the Great Dragon...It's amazing how that expressive voice conjures up every facial feature of that fine actor intoning his lines.  Family friendly on all levels and well into the third or fourth season in England...so know that you will be able to collect more as the stories spin out.  The twist is of course that Uther has banned magic from the kingdom and Merlin must surreptitiously learn and practice his craft in mortal fear of discovery.  Special Effects abound and never seem less than seamless and the stories reflect the growing friendship that is destiny intertwined of Arthur and Merlin.  The series location shooting is done in a wonderfull French castle that perfectly captures the enchanting look of Camelot yet to come.  All in all a fine way to be entertained for almost a hour and share in the joy and drama reflected in the faces of the children watching with you as they behold the magic and the splendor that is the legend of Arthur.,5,A Majestic Re-Imagining,1290124800,"11 19, 2010",2010,1332,"['Great', 'series', 'done', 'impeccably', 'right', 'Brits', 'wonderfully', 'youthfull', 'cast', 'pros', 'aided', 'familiar', 'face', 'US', 'audiences', 'Anthony', 'Head', 'Buffy', 'fame', 'Giles', 'Uther', 'Arthur', 'father', 'reigning', 'King', 'ably', 'supported', 'Merlin', 'mentor', 'Gaius', 'fine', 'actor', 'name', 'moment', 'apologies', 'casting', 'coupe', 'John', 'Hurt', 'voice', 'Great', 'Dragon', 'amazing', 'how', 'expressive', 'voice', 'conjures', 'up', 'facial', 'feature', 'fine', 'actor', 'intoning', 'lines', 'Family', 'friendly', 'levels', 'well', 'third', 'fourth', 'season', 'England', 'so', 'know', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'collect', 'more', 'stories', 'spin', 'out', 'twist', 'course', 'Uther', 'banned', 'magic', 'kingdom', 'Merlin', 'must', 'surreptitiously', 'learn', 'practice', 'craft', 'mortal', 'fear', 'discovery', 'Special', 'Effects', 'abound', 'never', 'seem', 'less', 'seamless', 'stories', 'reflect', 'growing', 'friendship', 'destiny', 'intertwined', 'Arthur', 'Merlin', 'series', 'location', 'shooting', 'done', 'wonderfull', 'French', 'castle', 'perfectly', 'enchanting', 'look', 'Camelot', 'yet', 'come', 'fine', 'way', 'be', 'entertained', 'almost', 'hour', 'share', 'joy', 'drama', 'reflected', 'children', 'watching', 'behold', 'magic', 'splendor', 'legend', 'Arthur']",N/A
