If you love these old shows, you'll love these opening editions.  I didn't watch these shows very much when I was a kid, so, my opinion is based more on the present than the past.  I found the acting and scripts to be mediocre.  I probably would not have bought this if I had known how mediocre they were.  But, hey, like I say, if you're a fan of these specific shows, you'll probably like this DVD.  The one benefit is that it does have just one show from each TV program.  You don't have to buy a whole series to discover whether you still like these shows from your childhood.",3,Oldies on TV,1310947200,"07 18, 2011",2011,656,"['DVD', 'opening', 'programs', 'TV', 'shows', 'mentioned', 'cover', 'love', 'old', 'shows', ""'ll"", 'love', 'opening', 'editions', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'shows', 'very', 'much', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'so', 'opinion', 'based', 'more', 'present', 'past', 'found', 'acting', 'scripts', 'be', 'mediocre', 'probably', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'bought', 'had', 'known', 'how', 'mediocre', 'were', 'hey', 'say', ""'re"", 'fan', 'specific', 'shows', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'DVD', 'one', 'benefit', 'have', 'just', 'one', 'show', 'TV', 'program', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'buy', 'whole', 'series', 'discover', 'still', 'shows', 'childhood']","NBC Western TV Legends - 4 of the first episodes of the longest running TV Westerns!
