I was so intrigued to see what it was supposed to be one of the best television series, What a disappointment!!, I watched the entire season 1 and still didn't understand why LOST was so admired, so I jumped season 2, and tried season 3 to see if something has happened, and I was so amazed to see that not a thing happened. LOST is so incredible boring, there's no action at all, no brain action, This is absolutely NOT a thinking person's notion of stimulating entertainment, If I were you, I would watch the first and last episode and I sware you won't miss a thing. They will be lost forever. I even thought that I should be hight (drugged) to get it, But i was tired of loosing my time here. Writers must be so astonished to see how people see this nonsense show, with no answers.. just question after question and I'm pretty sure they will come with ridiculous answers at the end. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME with this garbage. Try Prison Break which is an absolute 10!!! with great acting, plot and superb suspense.

1156899,A17BUUBOU0598B,B0017HZZP0,"Mark ""Technology, Music and Movies""","[45, 47]","Lostis a great show, although if you're here to buy this TV DVD collection I don't have to tell you that.  You're probably a hardcore fan already.  But for the few people that haven't gotten into Lost yet, I can  honestly say this is one of the few programs I can see somebody watching from beginning to end without any prior experience.  It just draws you in.It took me a while to get into Lost.  By season II my interest was peaked. And by now, I'm just as hooked as everybody else.  Watching these on DVD is better than watching the episodes on TV or even online.  First of all, all the DVD episodes are presented in the same widescreen format that was only available when watching over HD before.  The regular airings on network television was not the full widescreen but instead a chopped down version that's not nearly as great to look at.These DVDs also allow you to watch and re-watch these episodes whenever you please.  For those who are new to Lost that is a bigger deal than it may appear at first.  There's nothing better than being able to watch these shows back to back as well as re-watch the tricky parts and try to figure out all the sub-plots.  :)  The extras really help you get into it too, giving you great background and juicy info that will suck you in even further.  In fact the extras alone are worth the price of admission for any Lost junkie.There's another benefit to these disks.  Unlike those who have to wait for the next season or show to air based upon the VERY STRANGE and DISJOINTED practice of them delaying new episodes and taking long breaks between seasons, you can pace yourself through these seasons.  Discover the story on your own time and avoid the annoying schedules set by network television or the next writer's strike.To list all of the episode plot-lines isn't really something you need me to do here.  What I can tell you is at a high level what to expect from each of the seasons and what goodies are included.  Because this collection is really rich with special features, and that's really the value of getting this set.  Even if you've seen the episodes already, I can see alot of people still buying these disks for that alone.Lost - The Complete First SeasonAs you might expect, the first season set includes the Pilot episode that has become almost TV legend at this point.  The very diverse set of characters is introduced little by little through their interactions but more so through the flashbacks.  We get to learn about the fateful events that brought them all together and how they cope with the stress of being ... well, Lost.  :)Audio commentaries for the ""Pilot"" episode by the producers gives you a background into how the pilot got off the ground and filmed.  There are other audio commentaries that are episode specific for ""Walkabout,"" ""The Moth,"" and ""Hearts and Minds.""Most of the special features are included on the seventh disk, which is devoted to them. ""The Genesis of Lost"" shows us how everything started and evolved. ""Welcome to Oahu: The Making of The Pilot"" is standard making-of fare.  ""Designing a Disaster"" is a kind of featurette about how they filmed the amazing crash site from the ""Pilot.""""Before They Were Lost"" goes into the show's casting, which will really surprise a lot of people.  This show is amazingly cast, and when you see this you will be even more amazed at how they did it.  Audition footage is included too.  :)""Lost: On Location"" is a group of behind-the-scenes extras that cover some filming sequences.  This is very useful for aspiring film-makers and just general movie junkies.There are also some flashbacks from the season finale and over a dozen deleted scenes.Also included are some less useful, though still attention keeping extras.  Among them are:- ""The Art of Matthew Fox"" about photography he did during the ""Pilot."" Nice for people like me who like photography, but not for Lost purists.- ""Lost@Comicon"" is footage from Comicon and the actors who were there promoting the show- ""Onset with Jimmy Kimmel"" feels like a shameless network plug and shows some worthless and probably staged shenanigans- ""Live from the Museum of Television and Radio"" is another bit of self-promotion that includes very little- ""Backstage with Driveshaft"" takes a look at Charlie and his fictitious band- ""Bloopers from the Set"" is a gag reel that really didn't even need to be here.  Some people are into that stuff though.Lost - The Complete Second SeasonSeason 2 is a very direct continuation of the ending of the first season.  It does start to give the show more of a ""24"" like feel though.  Mysteries are solved but more questions are raised than answered.  And while we get a lot of background on key characters like Kate and Jack, it takes us a VERY long time to get there.  There are a lot of riddles and red herrings thrown in to make you think and throw you off.  Still, every episode has a value when you see things develop over all the seasons of the show.Audio commentaries are available for some episodes, including ""Man of Science, Man of Faith,"" ""What Kate Did,"" ""The 23rd Psalm,"" ""The Whole Truth"" and ""Dave.""They seem to have added more episode commentaries to make up for less on the special features disk. Disc seven includes:- ""Fire and Water: Anatomy of an Episode"" a ""making of an episode"" featurette- ""Lost: On Location"" a contrast of episodes shot on location instead of a studio- ""The World According to Sawyer"" which is a character  profile of Sawyer and his sarcastic comments- ""The Lost Flashbacks"" with three never before seen flashbacks- Over a dozen deleted scenes- Another annoying ""Lost Bloopers"" extra- A ""Channel 4 UK Promo"" which is a slow-motion music video type of comercial- ""Lost Connections""- a featurette about character inter-connections- ""Mysteries, Theories and Conspiracies"" helps fuel the fire on the many unanswered questions- ""Secrets from the Hatch"" is all about the hatch and how it was thought upLost - The Complete Third SeasonLike the second season, Lost's third season was originally split into two sections with one more popular than the other.  I still think all the episodes were important, though some do move faster than others.  And speaking of ""the others"" they really start to take center stage in this season.""Lost Book Club"" goes through the parallels between plot elements and the unraveling storylines ""Lost: On Location"" and ""Lost in a Day"" are ""making-of"" features that go into filming and it's challenges.There is a one-on-one with star Matthew Fox and a featurette on ""the others."" As usual we have the audio commentaries and deleted scenes.  We also again have the bloopers which we could have done without.""Cast in Clay: The Toys of Todd McFarlane"" goes into making toys for the show.  ""The Next Level: Inside the Video Game"" shows the making of the LOST game by Ubisoft.ConclusionEach season stands on its own as a tremedous work of TV.  Some will complain about the tail end of season two or the beginning half to season 3, but the more you watch and learn the more it all comes together.  This is a great show and a great set that is definitely worth owning.  You also save some money on the set, which is nice too.Enjoy!",5,Lost - Seasons I through III - A Great Collection,1210550400,"05 12, 2008",2008,7198,"['Lostis', 'great', 'show', ""'re"", 'here',

I've thoroughly enjoyed each season, and so when Christmas came this year, I decided to buy several of these sets to give as presents. I gave a set to my parents and to my sister and her husband. All of them are now hooked, and are watching episodes every night and then calling me and begging for clues about what will happen next! I think it's pretty telling that both my mother (in her fifties) and my sister and husband (late 20s) LOVE this show. It is really a well made show and this three season set is a perfect way to get started watching.Sort of a Gilligan's Island combined with the X-files, and with a story telling style rich in character development and subplots, LOST is a wonderfully well made show, and unlike anything else on TV. You will find yourself engrossed in all of the characters lives, and just when you think you have things figured out, something will happen that blows your mind.Well worth owning, LOST will go down as probably the greatest TV show of the 2000-2010 era.

I was trying to download something else and I must have clicked when I should have scrolled....and lo and behold, I ended up with the Lost pilot. An hour later I bought the season one DVD set at Best Buy. I didn't even bother to put on pants, I just went.Lost has that power. The power to entrance and mesmerize, to immediately captivate the viewer and hold their attention. Strangely enough, it can also repulse with the same magnitude, creating vocal critics, it seems, with every new episode.Some people find the characters fake, the sci-fi elements lame, the story line absurd and the twists insulting to their intelligence. They lament that questions are never answered, new ones constantly introduced, plot lines left un-ended, etc. The big payoff they suspect, will not be forthcoming.Maybe they are right, who knows? What I do know is that Lost is one of the best shows on television right now: great writers, great art direction, great acting, and a story you can really get hooked on.In my opinion the DVD sets are the way to go. You can watch the episodes without interruption and with picture and audio quality that is far superior to network television. For 33 bucks a pop you get around 20 hours of entertainment (per set), and once you've watched them all you'll want to go back and view them again to catch all the hints and connections you missed the first time around.Hate it or love it, I don't care.
