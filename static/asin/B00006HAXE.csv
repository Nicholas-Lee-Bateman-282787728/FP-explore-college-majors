Treasure Planet and Muppet's Treasure Island were both humorous at least. This is the only other version I could find locally. It started off promising enough, then it went downhill fast and never looked back. The settings and costumes were simply beautiful though. If you are hoping for a true-to-book movie this is the farthest thing possible. Frankly, it stinks.",1,WHAT were they thinking???,1237248000,"03 17, 2009",2009,479,"['Alright', 'finally', 'read', 'Treasure', 'Island', 'decided', 'needed', 'see', 'good', 'interpretation', 'film', 'ai', ""n't"", 'Treasure', 'Planet', 'Muppet', 'Treasure', 'Island', 'were', 'humorous', 'least', 'only', 'other', 'version', 'could', 'find', 'locally', 'started', 'off', 'promising', 'enough', 'then', 'went', 'downhill', 'fast', 'never', 'looked', 'back', 'settings', 'costumes', 'were', 'simply', 'beautiful', 'are', 'hoping', 'true-to-book', 'movie', 'farthest', 'thing', 'possible', 'Frankly']",Treasure Island
716002,A3DGVB3T5QJNRE,B00006HAXE,Danny G.,"[3, 3]","This film does not stray from the original story until the boat lands on Treasure Island!  It was a bit shocking at first, but Long John Silver's  (Jack Palance) and Jim Hawkins' (Kevin Zegers) superb acting makes this a very enjoyable fantasy to watch!This is a story of two very elderly men and a very capable  teenage boy! Jim Hawkins, while polite, is incredibly resilient and thinks very fast on his feet. And Long John Silver is not some evil minion, but a man of honor who believes in democracy, no less!My hats off to the filmmakers for having the courage to re-interpret a classic in such a dramatic fashion.

But this director/writer butchered the original story. He went far beyond taking liberties with it...he ruined it. The plot development is horrible...characters don't develop, they simply change in the time it takes to switch scenes. And as other reviewers have noted, the ending is probably the worst part of all. As I watched (painfully), I questioned if the director even bothered to read the book. He took a wonderful, rousing adventure and turned it into a sickening, useless film that I will never watch again, let alone buy.",1,Absolutely horrible!,1123372800,"08 7, 2005",2005,602,"['had', 'high', 'hopes', 'film', 'plenty', 'well-known', 'actors', 'director/writer', 'butchered', 'original', 'story', 'went', 'far', 'taking', 'liberties', 'ruined', 'plot', 'development', 'horrible', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'develop', 'simply', 'change', 'time', 'switch', 'scenes', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'ending', 'probably', 'worst', 'part', 'watched', 'painfully', 'questioned', 'director', 'even', 'bothered', 'read', 'book', 'took', 'wonderful', 'rousing', 'adventure', 'turned', 'sickening', 'useless', 'film', 'will', 'never', 'watch', 'again', 'let', 'alone', 'buy']",Treasure Island
716004,A34OXGWAC1XBOY,B00006HAXE,"Jay Gregg ""Geology professor""","[0, 0]","Avoid this deranged piece of garbage at all costs.  The story is so distorted from Robert Louis Stevenson's original that it should probably not be titled ""Treasure Island"".  I understand that sometimes liberties must be taken when making a movie out of a book.  But it really irritates me when Hollywood decides to completely distort the original story because they think that they can do better.  The acting is nothing short of awful.  I think that Jack Palance knew that he was in a turkey and only put in a half hearted effort.I read Treasure Island as a boy and then again to my children and now I am looking forward to reading it to my grandchildren.  The Charlton Heston version (I wish it would come out in DVD) of this movie is the best, in my opinion, with the Bobby Driscoll/Robert Newton and the Wallace Beery/Jackie Cooper classic not far behind.  All are true to Robert Louis Stevenson's story.  If you want to rent or buy Treasure Island, get one of these.

While Mr. Palance performed well, the story itself was totally twisted. The ""good guys"" became the ""bad guys"" and the ""bad guys"" turned out to be actually the ""good guys"". Par for our modern PC culture which fortunately R. L. Stevenson knew nothing about (and yes, I have read the original story). SPOILER: the story ends by the ""hero"" Long John Silver sailing to Jamaica with Jim Hawkins and Ben Gunn (the ""good guys"" of the show were killed during a fight at the treasure -- but the story was so twisted that you were actually glad they received their ""just reward"" in death!).

716007,A1GZ34D8AEE0SW,B00006HAXE,"S. Stevenson ""FictionAddict""","[12, 13]","After mistakenly getting this 1998 version of TREASURE ISLAND instead of the classic Disney one, I decided I would at least give this film starring Kevin Zegers (Air Bud) and Jack Palance a chance. But... maybe I shouldn't have taken that chance at all.The film opens out with a scene involving the pirates on Treasure Island, where Flint is having the treasure buried. We are shown how Pew and Long John Silver come to be blind and peg-legged. Billy Bones (Patrick Bergin) then arrives at the Admiral Benbow Inn where a long-haired Kevin Zegers greets him with a dash of rum. Billy Bones felt rightly cast, but Pew was not at the least bit as frightening as Stevenson describes, and Black Dog could have been a bit better as well.Some of the shots are amazing - on the island and on board the Hispaniola - and Kevin does an okay job as Jim Hawkins, though swinging between sounding like a little girl and a thirteen-year old whose voice just won't stop cracking.Problems arise in this version due to changes from the original story that just don't quite work that well. We never really SEE Long John Silver and Jim interacting on the boat that much, so we can't possibly understand why the old pirate has taken a liking to the boy. The ending shoot-out was mildly disappointing. However, I did feel that Ben Gunn was cast very well, and it was most humorous to watch him.All in all, this is mild at best, with a few great cinematic shots, but not enough meat to carry things along.",2,A Little Disappointing,1136764800,"01 9, 2006",2006,1482,"['mistakenly', 'getting', '1998', 'version', 'TREASURE', 'ISLAND', 'instead', 'classic', 'Disney', 'one', 'decided', 'would', 'least', 'give', 'film', 'starring', 'Kevin', 'Zegers', 'Air', 'Bud', 'Jack', 'Palance', 'chance', 'maybe', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'taken', 'chance', 'all.The', 'film', 'out', 'scene', 'involving', 'pirates', 'Treasure', 'Island', 'where', 'Flint', 'having', 'treasure', 'buried', 'are', 'shown', 'how', 'Pew', 'Long', 'John', 'Silver', 'come', 'be', 'blind', 'peg-legged', 'Billy', 'Bones', 'Patrick', 'Bergin', 'then', 'Admiral', 'Benbow', 'Inn', 'where', 'long-haired', 'Kevin', 'Zegers', 'dash', 'rum', 'Billy', 'Bones', 'felt', 'rightly', 'cast', 'Pew', 'was', 'not', 'least', 'bit', 'as', 'frightening', 'Stevenson', 'Black', 'Dog', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'better', 'well.Some', 'shots', 'are', 'amazing', 'island', 'board', 'Hispaniola', 'Kevin', 'okay', 'job', 'Jim', 'Hawkins', 'swinging', 'sounding', 'little', 'girl', 'thirteen-year', 'old', 'voice', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'stop', 'cracking.Problems', 'arise', 'version', 'due', 'changes', 'original', 'story', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work', 'well', 'never', 'really', 'SEE', 'Long', 'John', 'Silver', 'Jim', 'interacting', 'boat', 'much', 'ca', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'understand', 'why', 'old', 'pirate', 'taken', 'liking', 'boy', 'ending', 'shoot-out', 'was', 'mildly', 'disappointing', 'However', 'did', 'feel', 'Ben', 'Gunn', 'was', 'cast', 'very', 'well', 'was', 'most', 'humorous', 'watch', 'him.All', 'mild', 'best', 'few', 'great', 'cinematic', 'shots', 'not', 'enough', 'meat', 'carry', 'things', 'along']",Treasure Island
