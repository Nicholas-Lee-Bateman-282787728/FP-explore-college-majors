I paid an arm and a leg for it on E-Bay only to get a VHS copy of the film that was visibly `worn'.  Despite the package it came in, the film played fine.  Sadly, I wish that the VHS tape had been broken and I didn't have to suffer through this horrid film.  I love Martin Short.  I guess I should take that back.  I like Martin Short usually, and can love him occasionally, but here he is just wasted on a hapless script that goes nowhere with gags that suffer from lack of any real wit.  The film just falls apart because it can't muster up a single ounce of originality or actual comedic timing.  I can't think of a single scene in this film where I even smiled; it was that unfunny.  Glover and Short are wasted here, and the film has zero redeemable factors, to the point where I really just wanted to turn it off but couldn't because I didn't want to hurt my wife's feelings.  I had to force a smile until the film ended and she told me that it wasn't what she remembered and I let out a sigh of relief as we both laughed at how dumb the movie was.  Basically, Short is reduced to a series of endless accidents.

First and last good film by director Nadia Tass.Valerie (Sheila Kelley) is unluckiest women on the face of the Earth. She disappears in Mexico without the trace and nobody have any clue what happen. Her frustrated rich father taking his last chance with very odd team: ""Private Eye"" Ray (Danny Glover) and Eugene, unluckiest man on the face of the Earth ( Martin Short). The plan is simple: go to Mexico and let Eugene just be himself. Did it work? Sure it did, but you have to se how.This comedy is 100% pure fun. The only one reason why I gave it 4 stars is the French film, which I've seen many times. No one can beat a  French team of G&eacute;rard Depardieu and Pier Rishard.""Vlad""",4,100% pure fun.,1061856000,"08 26, 2003",2003,757,"['Very', 'good', 'remake', 'French', 'film', 'La', 'Chevre', 'Knock', 'Wood', 'First', 'last', 'good', 'film', 'director', 'Nadia', 'Tass.Valerie', 'Sheila', 'Kelley', 'unluckiest', 'women', 'face', 'Earth', 'Mexico', 'trace', 'nobody', 'have', 'clue', 'what', 'happen', 'frustrated', 'rich', 'father', 'taking', 'last', 'chance', 'very', 'odd', 'team', 'Private', 'Eye', 'Ray', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'Eugene', 'unluckiest', 'man', 'face', 'Earth', 'Martin', 'Short', 'plan', 'simple', 'go', 'Mexico', 'let', 'Eugene', 'just', 'be', 'Did', 'work', 'Sure', 'did', 'have', 'se', 'how.This', 'comedy', '100', '%', 'pure', 'fun', 'only', 'one', 'reason', 'why', 'gave', '4', 'stars', 'French', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', 'times', 'one', 'can', 'beat', 'French', 'team', 'G', 'eacute', 'Depardieu', 'Pier', 'Rishard', 'Vlad']",Pure Luck VHS
