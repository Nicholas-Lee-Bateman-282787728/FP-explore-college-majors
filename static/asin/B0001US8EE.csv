That you actually HURT from laughing so hard? Well, this show does that to me. This little show that Larry David has created is pure genius. Now, it did take me a couple of episodes watching it on HBO before I got into it, as Season One definitely has its hits and misses. But the ball really gets rolling in Season Two. I can't wait for Season Three, it just keeps getting better. This is the best thing on television. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who watched ""Seinfeld"" regularly; as it's kinda fun to see the similarities between the two in it's own right!

Benz ""CJB""","[0, 2]","Every great TV show has a particularly great series where everything about the execution peaks and for Curb Your Enthusiasm it has to be this second series. The 'running' subplot of Larry trying to restart his TV career first with Jason Alexander and then with Julia Louis-Dreyfus playing themselves is a hilarious catalyst for all of the brilliant plotting in these eps. Curb already revolutionised the modern sit com with it's tightly plotted storylines, and who would've thought - all of the brilliant dialogue in this series is ad-libbed by the sensational cast (many of them standup comics or experienced comic actors). By shunning artificial studio sets in favour of real locations, it makes 'Friends' look like a Fisher Price commercial. The best thing about the show is the courageous presentation of Larry David as a weirdly sympathetic anti-hero. Why do we always go with him on these gut wrenching, doomed for failure hair-brained schemes? His self interest and miserly tendencies always get the better of him and like every good song that we already know the words to, we're happy to go on the same journey and see just how he manages to screw up his life this time. There is an episode in this series which for me, shines above all other Curb shows involving bottles of water, a bathroom without a lock and a doll's head. It is magnificently relentless and absolutely hysterical. I rank it with 'The Rat' episode  in Fawlty Towers as one of the funniest eps in sitcom history. If you like this show already, then buy this - it is as good as it gets. If you have a passing interest only, this is the best place to start.

You can see Jerry and George in his attitude, his facial expressions, his movements, his interaction with people, and even his voice. The stories in Curb your enthusiasm and the way people interact with one another are all very similar to the Seinfeld style, with the exception of all the dirty 4 letter words thrown around of course. Larry has the knack for making people who watch the show cringe with embarassment for him. He never fails to hurt someone's feelings somehow and have it bite him in the rear-end later on in the show or even later in the series.

The main characters are the same, with Larry David playing himself, Jeff Garlin as Jeff Greene (Larry's agent), and Cheryl Hines as Cheryl David (Larry's wife). As with the first season the shows are unscripted, and they focus on a single character (Larry) as he manages to rub people the wrong way in almost every facet of his life, and yet still manages to remain sympathetic enough for the show to work..  I found the episodes in the second season to be less predictable than those in the first season.  In addition, the humor is drawn from many more diverse elements than in the first season.There are ten episodes in the season of ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"".  As was done for some of the Seinfeld series, this season the show has a season long plot which is present in most of the episodes.  That premise is that Larry is trying to develop a series where the main character is an actor from a successful situation comedy and who is trying to distance themselves from their former role.  Jason Alexander and Julia Louis-Dreyfus each play themselves in this storyline.  Each episode also has its own storyline, which range from Larry trying his hand at being a car salesman to Larry accidentally tripping Shaquille O'Neal to his misunderstanding a Baptism for an attempted drowning, and more.The only area where this collection falls short of season one would be in the area of special features.  Quite simply there aren't any included.  However, one doesn't buy a DVD for special features and the episodes of the second season of ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" are gems.

When you watch this show, you can't help but see the similarities.One of the more interesting things about this show is that the dialogue is totally unscripted.  This adds a freshness to the show that is very unique.The show features a lot of cameos from Larry David's circle of Hollywood friends who generally play themself.My only complaint is that there are only 10 episodes per season.

I just started getting in the show a few months ago after renting season one on DVD.  While season one was enjoyable season two raises the bar even higher.  In the second season there is a common theme that runs throughout the episodes.  Larry David tries to pitch a new TV show to variety of networks.  Season Two has many appearances by former Seinfeld stars Jason Alexander and Julia-Louis Dreyfus as they try to pitch the new show.The writing and acting on this improved show are great.  I cannot wait for season three to come out on DVD in January.  More good news is that Larry David is working on a new season right now.  I recommend this show for anyone that is a big fan of Seinfeld.  I would also recommend Arrested Development and the UK's The Office.  These shows are creating the best comedy today.11 - The Car Salesman12 - Thor13 - Trick or Treat14 - The Shrimp Incident15 - The Thong16 - The Acupuncturist17 - The Doll18 - Shaq19 - The Baptism20 - The Massage,5,Curb Your Enthusiasm,1101945600,"12 2, 2004",2004,1063,"['Larry', 'David', 'Curb', 'Enthusiasm', 'gold', 'standard', 'comedy', 'series', 'moment', 'just', 'started', 'getting', 'show', 'few', 'months', 'ago', 'renting', 'season', 'one', 'DVD', 'season', 'one', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'season', 'two', 'bar', 'even', 'higher', 'second', 'season', 'common', 'theme', 'episodes', 'Larry', 'David', 'pitch', 'new', 'TV', 'show', 'variety', 'networks', 'Season', 'Two', 'many', 'appearances', 'former', 'Seinfeld', 'stars', 'Jason', 'Alexander', 'Julia-Louis', 'Dreyfus', 'try', 'pitch', 'new', 'show.The', 'writing', 'acting', 'improved', 'show', 'are', 'great', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'season', 'three', 'come', 'out', 'DVD', 'January', 'More', 'good', 'news', 'Larry', 'David', 'working', 'new', 'season', 'right', 'now', 'recommend', 'show', 'anyone', 'big', 'fan', 'Seinfeld', 'would', 'also', 'recommend', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'UK', 'Office', 'shows', 'are', 'creating', 'best', 'comedy', 'today.11', 'Car', 'Salesman12', 'Thor13', 'Trick', 'Treat14', 'Shrimp', 'Incident15', 'Thong16', 'Acupuncturist17', 'Doll18', 'Shaq19', 'Baptism20', 'Massage']",Curb Your Enthusiasm: Season 2
813367,A27RJ30RN5K9MX,B0001US8EE,Mitch Weaver,"[2, 3]","I have always been a huge fan of HBO television. However, Curb Your Enthusiasm was a show that I always stayed away from up until very recently. I have never seen a single episode of Seinfeld, and Curb Your Enthusiasm focuses around the co-creator of that show Larry David. I was worried that refrences to Seinfeld in the show would make things confusing for me. However, after hearing from a countless amount of people how great Curb Your Enthusiasm was, I decided to put my skepticism aside and give it a shot. Curb Your Enthusiasm has to be one of the funniest shows that I have ever seen in my life and despite the few references to Seinfeld, I was able to keep up with no problem. The show is set up in the form of a ""mockumentary"" to show Larry David's life after Seinfeld and how he spends his time in his daily life. The reason the show is so funny, is because they portray Larry David as a constant victim of circumstance. The brilliance of this show, is that each episode focuses on how Larry's bad luck effects him and others around him. The show is quite addicting because of the fact that each episode manages to come up with new and entertaining ways for Larry to make a fool out of himself.The second season of Curb Your Enthusiasm somehow manages to be even funnier and more entertaining than the first season. A few episodes worth mentioning are - ""Thor"" in which Larry becomes obsessed with showing Cheryl how un-kinky he is, and after one of their neighbors takes his casual greeting the wrong way, his wife mistakenly concludes that Larry has an ass [...] ; ""Trick or Treat"" in which Larry experiences the ""trick"" side of Halloween when Larry refuses to give candy to two teenagers who are not wearing costumes; and the funniest episode out of the first two seasons ""The Doll"" that revolves around Larry trying to find a replacement doll for the daughter of an ABC executive.Now I have only seen the first two seasons of Curb Your Enthusiasm on DVD. But the second season manages to become funnier and more entertaining. Overall, after watching the first two seasons of the show, I can honestly say that it offers some of the best writing I have ever seen, and it is one of the funniest shows ever. Despite the lack of extras, and that there is only ten episodes once again, the second season of Curb Your Enthusiasm is definately worth owning on DVD. All I can say is that I am highly anticipating the third season.A solid 5 stars...",5,Even funnier than season one,1101513600,"11 27, 2004",2004,2454,"['have', 'always', 'been', 'huge', 'fan', 'HBO', 'television', 'However', 'Curb', 'Your', 'Enthusiasm', 'was', 'show', 'always', 'stayed', 'away', 'very', 'recently', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'single', 'episode', 'Seinfeld', 'Curb', 'Your', 'Enthusiasm', 'co-creator', 'show', 'Larry', 'David', 'was', 'worried', 'refrences', 'Seinfeld', 'show', 'would', 'make', 'things', 'confusing', 'However', 'hearing', 'countless', 'amount', 'people', 'how', 'great', 'Curb', 'Your', 'Enthusiasm', 'was', 'decided', 'put', 'skepticism', 'aside', 'give', 'shot', 'Curb', 'Enthusiasm', 'be', 'one', 'funniest', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'life', 'few', 'references', 'Seinfeld', 'was', 'able', 'keep', 'up', 'problem', 'show', 'set', 'up', 'form', 'mockumentary', 'show', 'Larry', 'David', 'life', 'Seinfeld', 'how', 'time', 'daily', 'life', 'reason', 'show', 'so', 'funny', 'portray', 'Larry', 'David', 'constant', 'victim', 'circumstance', 'brilliance', 'show', 'episode', 'how', 'Larry', 'bad', 'luck', 'effects', 'others', 'show', 'quite', 'addicting', 'fact', 'episode', 'come', 'up', 'new', 'entertaining', 'ways', 'Larry', 'make', 'fool', 'himself.The', 'second', 'season', 'Curb', 'Your', 'Enthusiasm', 'somehow', 'be', 'even', 'funnier', 'more', 'entertaining', 'first', 'season', 'few', 'episodes', 'mentioning', 'are', 'Thor', 'Larry', 'obsessed', 'showing', 'Cheryl', 'how', 'un-kinky', 'one', 'neighbors', 'casual', 'greeting', 'wrong', 'way', 'wife', 'mistakenly', 'Larry', 'ass', '[', ']', 'Trick', 'Treat', 'Larry', 'trick', 'side', 'Halloween', 'when', 'Larry', 'give', 'candy', 'two', 'teenagers', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'wearing', 'costumes', 'funniest', 'episode', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'Doll', 'Larry', 'trying', 'find', 'replacement', 'doll', 'daughter', 'ABC', 'executive.Now', 'have', 'only', 'seen', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'Curb', 'Your', 'Enthusiasm', 'DVD', 'second', 'season', 'manages', 'become', 'funnier', 'more', 'entertaining', 'Overall', 'watching', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'show', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'best', 'writing', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'one', 'funniest', 'ever', 'lack', 'extras', 'only', 'ten', 'episodes', 'once', 'again', 'second', 'season', 'Curb', 'Your', 'Enthusiasm', 'definately', 'worth', 'owning', 'DVD', 'can', 'say', 'am', 'highly', 'anticipating', 'third', 'season.A', 'solid', '5', 'stars']",Curb Your Enthusiasm: Season 2

One, we don't get cable or HBO, and two, everything I heard about it was that Larry David was such a miserable, downer character.  While I think SEINFELD was some of the funniest stuff on television, I figured I didn't need to watch this glum guy who isn't really an actor starring in a TV show as ""himself.""Well, finally, my 17 year old son dragged me in front of the TV to watch some of the DVDs he had borrowed.  I'm so GLAD he did!!First of all, Larry David is far from a complete misanthrope.  Granted, he's got a naturally whiny voice, slouchy posture and a natural cynicism that comes with intelligence.  But he's actually a fairly warm guy.  Unlike Jerry and his gang, he actually mostly gets himself into trouble trying to do something NICE, not nasty.  A good example:  In one episode, he's at a party that he's clearly not terribly interested in.  He goes upstairs to find a restroom (cuz the lock downstairs doesn't work...that's a whole other subplot) and bumps into the young daughter of the family that owns the house.  He uses the restroom and then he actually takes a moment to speak with the young girl in a friendly and genuine manner.  He apparently feels for the fact that she's been made to be cooped up in her room while the adults chat and drink below.  He talks with her about her doll, and as the two interact, she asks Larry to cut the doll's  hair.  Not having children of his own and not knowing better, Larry does so, and actually seems to enjoy his time with the little girl.  Of course, five minutes later she's screaming and complaining to momma about the horrible man that cut the doll's hair!  It's a frustrating situation that gets funnier as Larry tries to solve it...but the catalyst for the whole thing stems from Larry David being nice.  Genuinely.The show has lots of moments like this.  And it's greatly helped by the delightful Cheryl Hines who plays David's wife.  They have a palpable affection, but if feels like the affection of a couple that's been together for awhile.  They can clearly annoy each other, but always with affection underneath.  They understand each other's weaknesses, but never is the solidity of their relationship threatened.  It's a believably happy marriage.The show is in a very improvisational style, not at all like carefully crafted dialogue on SEINFELD.  Yet the plots are neatly structured and the characters are rich.  The episodes are sprinkled with wonderful cameos and appearances by many recognizable character actors.  The show is pleasantly non-mean-spirited, and very funny.In keeping with HBO shows, it can be fairly graphic in its language, so it's not for kids.  But the humor isn't much for kids either.  It's a grownup show for intelligent grown-ups, and I HIGHLY recommend it.

If you're a parent who cares, I advise you to read the following sentences: I don't understand the rating for most of the TV-MA episodes. I'd say that besides ""Thor,"" ""The Shrimp Incident,"" and maybe ""The Massage"" (just because of the massage scene), all of the episodes are okay for any mature 14-year-old to watch. They're mostly just rated that for language, which I've never really found an appropriate sole reason to rate a movie R or a TV episode TV-MA. Sexual content and violence are much more important than the number of F-bombs spoken. If you're a parent with a kid who really wants to see this show, allow him/her to get the first two seasons. And apparently Amazon has season eight listed as TV-14 so maybe that one's appropriate too. I don't know, I haven't seen it. Now on to the review part...""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" is one of the most acclaimed shows of the 2000s, and rightfully so. While the first season was refreshing because it was nice to be further reminded that sitcoms were still doing pretty well, this second season takes that and elevates it to an even higher level. The ensemble cast is better in this season. While Cheryl seemed like a minor character in the first season, her character has been developed a little more here and given more of a personality. I also like the addition of Wanda Sykes. She's not on-screen very often at all, but when she is, she's unsurprisingly hilarious. Season two also saw an increase in writing quality. The plots are usually quite unique and bizarre, allowing for more laughs. Take ""Thor,"" in which Larry is threatened by a 250-pound boxer after an unfortunate misunderstanding. Or ""Shaq,"" in which Larry trips Shaq at a basketball game.Best episodes: ""The Doll"" and ""The Baptism""Season grade: A-",5,"A brilliant season of this show, also one of the least vulgar",1374451200,"07 22, 2013",2013,1867,"[""'re"", 'adult', 'who', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'how', 'appropriate', 'stuff', 'kids', 'skip', 'paragraph', ""'re"", 'parent', 'who', 'advise', 'read', 'following', 'sentences', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'rating', 'most', 'TV-MA', 'episodes', ""'d"", 'say', 'Thor', 'Shrimp', 'Incident', 'maybe', 'Massage', 'just', 'massage', 'scene', 'episodes', 'are', 'okay', 'mature', '14-year-old', 'watch', ""'re"", 'mostly', 'just', 'rated', 'language', ""'ve"", 'never', 'really', 'found', 'appropriate', 'sole', 'reason', 'rate', 'movie', 'R', 'TV', 'episode', 'TV-MA', 'Sexual', 'content', 'violence', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'important', 'number', 'F-bombs', 'spoken', ""'re"", 'parent', 'kid', 'who', 'really', 'see', 'show', 'allow', 'him/her', 'get', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'apparently', 'Amazon', 'season', 'eight', 'listed', 'TV-14', 'maybe', 'one', 'appropriate', 'too', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Now', 'review', 'part', 'Curb', 'Enthusiasm', 'one', 'most', 'acclaimed', 'shows', '2000s', 'rightfully', 'so', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'refreshing', 'was', 'nice', 'be', 'further', 'reminded', 'sitcoms', 'were', 'still', 'doing', 'pretty', 'well', 'second', 'season', 'even', 'higher', 'level', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'better', 'season', 'Cheryl', 'seemed', 'minor', 'character', 'first', 'season', 'character', 'been', 'developed', 'little', 'more', 'here', 'given', 'more', 'personality', 'also', 'addition', 'Wanda', 'Sykes', 'not', 'on-screen', 'very', 'often', 'when', 'unsurprisingly', 'hilarious', 'Season', 'two', 'also', 'saw', 'increase', 'writing', 'quality', 'plots', 'are', 'usually', 'quite', 'unique', 'bizarre', 'allowing', 'more', 'laughs', 'Take', 'Thor', 'Larry', 'threatened', '250-pound', 'boxer', 'unfortunate', 'misunderstanding', 'Shaq', 'Larry', 'Shaq', 'basketball', 'game.Best', 'episodes', 'Doll', 'Baptism', 'Season', 'grade', 'A-']",Curb Your Enthusiasm: Season 2
