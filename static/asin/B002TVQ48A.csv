I have not seen it but this movie is similar, according to Ferrara and he was quite livid over its release. Werner Herzog claims to have never seen this film.Controversies aside, Bad Lieutenant delivers.In my opinion, there are four factors that make the film outstanding, Nicolas Cage, Werner Herzog the director, the script and the city of New Orleans.Nicholas Cage delivers a flawless performance as the pain riddled, drug addicted, corrupt cop who is completely out of control. His performance will reaffirm the faith of his old fans while drawing new ones. His awkward walk because of crippling back pain, his tone of voice and his dialogue delivery is superb. Kudos. He plays Terrence Mcdonagh and is investigating the murders of an entire Senegalese family. His girl friend is played by Eva Mendes and she is fair. Val Kilmer plays his co-worker and is relegated to a five minute cameo, hey what happened to this once A-lister. All the supporting characters have interesting story lines and they make this movie complete and worth watching.

1288744,A4VH04TA14CPE,B002TVQ48A,"Angry Mofo ""angrymofo""","[3, 3]","At first, Herzog's latest was just plain exhausting. The picture-perfect ending initially came across as a sneering, nihilistic slap in the face after all the misdeeds accumulated in the movie. But then I got to thinking. In the scenes between Nicolas Cage and Xzibit, Cage's character adopts precisely the one attitude that has any chance of success. Not that he'd consciously planned it, but he couldn't have done a better job if he had. A character like Big Fate understands extravagantly sleazy and reckless behaviour, it fits into his worldview. If one demonstrates sufficient extremes of recklessness (like pulling a gun on him while driving), that just might sort of begin to elicit respect, assuming one didn't instantly get killed. In that situation, acting crazy is the only way to stay alive.Despite being high all the time, the lieutenant pulls off a very delicate balancing act. Thugs come to extort money from him, threaten to disfigure his girlfriend and shoot his dog. He can't fight them, but showing any sign of weakness will just goad them into carrying out their threats. So, he agrees to their demands for money, but acts in a businesslike, sleazy manner. He won't hand the girl over to the thugs, but only because (he says) she hasn't had time to make herself look attractive. Miraculously, they don't press the point. He's speaking exactly their language.So, in the end, the lieutenant does a neat job of work, in a sense. He solves the murder of the drug-dealing immigrants, and the culprit is punished, though not for that particular crime, and not in a particularly orderly fashion. It's important to note that the lieutenant insists on the mobster's arrest; Val Kilmer's character wants to play the corrupt cop and steal the mobster's drugs, but the lieutenant forces him to make the arrest. He does jeopardize a bunch of innocent people's lives, but happily they suffer no permanent damage. A few thugs died, but they were obviously pretty low types, so the film's audience doesn't have to feel bad.If you've ever read the classic crime novels ofDashiell Hammett, you'll recognize this setup. Hammett's novelRed Harvestexplores this idea of the morally ambiguous crime-fighter, who descends into the underworld, engages in questionable acts, makes all kinds of bargains and alliances with criminals, pretends to be after money or women, while all this time, deep down, none of this really affects him, and he is truly motivated only by his distaste for the criminals. There is not much inner monologue; you see what the detective does, but you're often left guessing as to why. As a result, bodies pile up and many thugs die gruesome deaths, but the idea is that they all had it coming anyway, so the reader is supposed to ignore the lack of due process.Hammett's concept was, ""Plans are all right sometimes. And sometimes just stirring things up is all right."" The detective doesn't really have a master plan, he just acts on instinct and eventually things work out. That idea seems to be present in Herzog's film, and also in his previous filmRescue Dawn, where Christian Bale's character also had a sort of vague general moral code, but then just did whatever came into his head, and counted on his instinct and willpower to get him through. Cage's character here just throws himself headfirst into the chaos, always going all the way and living on the edge, but carefully modulating his reactions to suit the situation at hand.Fortunately, Herzog tempers his paean to impulsiveness with sympathetic details. At one point, the lieutenant starts to look, hilariously, like a harried family man, trying to simultaneously handle witness protection for the murder case, ferry his girlfriend to safety, and even take care of his parents' dog. This is completely goofy, but it shows you that he does have a bizarre sense of responsibility. This makes it easier to accept him than it is to like the detective in Red Harvest, who has no human connections of any kind. It also makes the film more suspenseful, as he means well, but seems to be spiraling out of control.So, the message (if there is one) is mostly about the joys of winging it and throwing caution to the winds. Which fits into Herzog's worldview well enough. And just in case you forget who's behind the camera, he recycles the music from the end ofStroszekduring a hysterical hallucination scene. There are many other odd images in the film, mostly involving iguanas, as well as occasional philosophical lines in the dialogue that would never be spoken by real-life thugs (although they do greatly resemble Herzog's narration inGrizzly Man), but are convincing enough in the film. Many of the generic supporting characters are given just enough quirks to be interesting, like the awesome dude with a mullet who says ""whoa"" and ""oh yeah.""Herzog's reinvention of himself as a Hollywood director in the 2000s, starting withInvincible, is an odd development. Maybe it's because, these days, no one is willing to fund the kinds of films he used to make, and even a more mainstream film like this can't get released unless it's billed as a remake (Herzog's film has nothing in common with Abel Ferrara's ""Bad Lieutenant,"" the title was forced on him by the producers). ""Port Of Call New Orleans"" won't supercedeclassicHerzog (though I'd love to hear him try to explain where the ""poetic truth"" is here), but it is suspenseful and memorable. After one thinks a bit about the details that stayed in one's mind, it becomes clear that the film is very entertaining and delivers a great time.",4,"Herzog meets Hammett: baffling at first, but give

I got this because I've been on quest for the last couple of years to collect all of his movies on DVD, something I believe as of this writing to be impossible (e.g., HERDSMEN OF THE SUN).Herzog sure puts me off my feed:  I can swallow his arthouse films just fine; it's his more mainstream jobs that are over my head.For example, what is he up to with this one, BAD LIEUTENANT?  While watching it, I had to check the DVD case a couple of times to ensure it was directed by Herzog, but no:  the iguana scenes, if nothing else, are his lion's paw.On the surface it's a story of a corrupt cop in post-Katrina New Orleans who manages to get the job done even though nobody expects him to.  Haven't we seen this material before, and done much better?  The dialogue is forgettable, the lessons the script purports to inculcate are murky when not hackneyed, and the film doesn't render much of the flavor of life in New Orleans.

Those of us who had been following him from the beginning, who loved his quirky indie films with offbeat directors, were horrified at what he'd become.  Now he has teamed with the ultimate indie, offbeat director, Werner Herzog, to reclaim his roots. I believe that both Herzog and Cage have made a movie that is an extended metaphor about post Katrina New Orleans.  Cage IS that post Katrina beleaguered city. He starts out the film injured and heroic and then zig zags through the rest of the film exhibiting the behavior of a post traumatic stress disorder patient who is untreated, like such a soldier from Vietnam or Iraq.  For Herzog's part, he's always been about imagery and metaphors and he doesn't disappoint here in rendering the ultimate imagery and metaphor for post Katrina New Orleans.  This is a very different movie from Abel Ferrara's movie starring Harvey Kietel set in New York.  That film was a true character study of a really bad cop who worked for the NYPD.  It was also excellent but very different from this film.  Is Cage Herzog's new alter ego Klaus Kinski (his late leading man)?  I doubt it.

Maybe, because little acting chops are needed. Then, again, that's the point of satire, to show that little effort is needed in mimicking the crap that passes for quality, in most instances. The DVD, put out by First Look Studios, shows the film in a 1.85:1 aspect ratio, and there are only a few DVD features. An audio commentary is not among them. This is a shame, for with a good prompter, Herzog is amongst the best film commentarians going. What we do get are two trailers for the film, photos from the shoot, by Herzog's wife, and a slapped together `Making Of' documentary that is not really a documentary, just captured footage. Peter Zeitlinger's cinematography is as good as it's always been, in these such films. The musical scoring, by Herzog and Mark Isham, is also good, and quite feral and raw. The focus on odd bits, such as breakdancing ghosts of dead mobsters, invisible iguanas on coffee tables, snakes that slither through flooded prisons, and an alligator that eyes its run over and dying mate from its own eye level, are just some of the odd views the film gives. Even the actors, in minor roles, don't really act, they just are, and become as iconographically symbolic as the animals.Yet, the film has power, because, as Serpico showed, there are few things more `real' in film than cops who abuse their power. Yes, Cage's Terry becomes almost clown-like, but the things he does are done every day, in every major police force, all around the world. The Blue Wall Of Silence protects the scumbags. Terry's is the Type 1 corrupt cop. They are up to 5 % of all cops. Type 2 is the cop who does not commit brazenly illegal acts, but writes false tickets to meet quotas, harasses drivers, and takes bribes (in the form of money or female's phone numbers) to drop charges against them. They are up to 80 % of the police force. Type 3 is the most prevalent corruption, and they are the 99+% of cops who look the other way at Types 1 and 2. (obviously there's overlap between the three types) So, claims that the film is not realistic are wrong; it's merely stylized realism. And, the film it actually shares the most, thematically, with is Curtis Hanson's 1997 masterpiece, L.A. Confidential, which also focuses on corrupt cops and an execution in a home. But Bad Lieutenant: Port Of Call: New Orleans really has only one kinship, and that's with the many oddball films in Herzog's own canon. My guess is that fictive masterpieces like he did in the first two decades of his career, are simply beyond Herzog now, and that the best we can get, not unlike Woody Allen, are flashes of brilliance, and the occasional mesmerizing small documentary. Good enough for most filmmakers, but coming from Herzog, it's hard to put aside the notion that his career could have been even more, could have transfigured the medium to an even greater degree. Nonetheless, films like this will suffice, just as they will entertain and dog the viewer with a mind demanding more than just the Hollywood formulae of yore. See it, and move somewards from your self.

Hall, Shea Whigham and Michael ShannonWRITTEN BY: William M. Finkelstein; inspired by the previous film Bad Lieutenant, written by Victor Argo, Paul Calderon, Abel Ferrara and Zoe LundDIRECTED BY: Werner HerzogRated: RGenre: DramaRelease Date: 20 November 2009Nicolas Cage delivers his most daring performance since his Oscar winning role in Leaving Las Vegas. Much like his character in that film, Terence in The Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans, finds himself wondering down a dark path in a tornado of self destruction. He's a police officer who also happens to be a drug addict and a criminal.There is no one big case that Terence is assigned to in this film and that is due mainly to the film's setting: a post Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans. Terence is a man who finds much to do with his new found freedom of working in the slums of a city brought nearly to its knees.He forces himself onto women, gambles heavily, he steals drugs from both drug dealers and evidence lockers - taking them while on duty, and he cheats on his prostitute of a girlfriend. Few actors could have taken a premise as disturbing as this and a character as twisted as Terence and made both not only tolerable but likeable. Cage is an actor more than capable.It's worth mentioning without disclosing in full detail, how good this film is at having us believe this man would be able to get away with these things. He is constantly on the verge of being found out, and yet somehow amidst his coked out madness, he is able to use his police detective wit to outsmart his counterparts and the criminals he comes into contact with who want him dead.

Nicolas Cage presented a bravura performance as New Orleans Police Lieutenant Terence McDonagh. McDonagh is bad in every sense of the word. He's addicted to prescription pain killers, heavily uses crack, cocaine, and heroin, steals drugs from the police property room, builds up huge debts due to binge gambling, and seems to have the morality of an alley cat. He lies like the proverbial rug. Indeed, he lies like a carpet factory. He ends up working for drug dealers to get the drugs he needs and the cash he needs to pay off his gambling debts.And he goes around with a gun stuck in the middle of his belt that looks like it was ripped off the deck of the U.S.S. Constitution.Yes, the lieutenant is bad and he's out of control. Cage put a lot into projecting this image.One weakness of the movie was the turn it took at the end.

1288766,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B002TVQ48A,DanD,"[5, 6]","This is New Orleans, post-Hurricane Katrina.  This is the city where Lt. Terence McDonagh works.  He's not afraid to torture an old lady to get what he wants.  He's not afraid to have sex with a girl outside a club just to confiscate the drugs in her purse.  Nor is he afraid to risk his life in the call of higher justice.  And when a family is murdered, he's royally pissed.  Or maybe he's just looking to score a cheap high.THE BAD LIEUTENANT: PORT OF CALL-NEW ORLEANS is not for everyone.  It's not your average cop movie; there is very little to like in Terence, who in the hands of Nicholas Cage comes across as a needy, sadistic, drug-addicted purveyor of law and order.  Sure, he's got a couple redeeming features; he'll do the right thing, eventually, if enough innocent people get hurt.  In the hands of Nicholas Page (finally displaying his immense talent, after several years of slacking), Terence is strangely likable, and yet you're always afraid of what he'll do next.  His friends aren't much better; his girlfriend (a haunting Eva Mendes) is a druggie and prostitute; and his partner (Val Kilmer, showing a fine return to form and grossly underused) is almost as crazy as he is.Werner Herzog's direction is at times a bit too trippy for its own good; we get lingering shots of nonexistent iguanas and dancing souls that are absolutely hilarious at first; but the shots stretch on too long, and the humor is lost.  Yet, when the film hits the right notes, it's almost like nothing you've ever seen before.  You HAVE seen it--numerous times--but the fact that the film comes off as original is truly impressive.  We can thank Nic Cage for that; his energetic, over-the-top performance roots this film in irreality, giving it that hard, dark edge that we don't get much of anymore.

1288771,A2FEJIORC1MBG3,B002TVQ48A,D. Hartley,"[26, 31]","Who could have guessed that the man who helmed art house classics like ""Fitzcarraldo"", ""Woyzeck"" and ""Aguirre the Wrath of God"" would one day make a film entitled ""Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call-New Orleans""? Then again, one might argue that the iconoclastic Werner Herzog's career would be nothing, if not perennially unpredictable.Herzog's latest film, arguably adorned with the year's most unwieldy title for squeezing onto a marquee, is a (sort of) sequel to Abel Ferrara's controversial 1992 neo-noir, ""Bad Lieutenant"" which was about a drug and gambling-addicted NYC homicide investigator. In that film, Harvey Keitel gave a fearless and maniacal performance as a ""cop on the edge"" who made most of the criminals he was paid to apprehend look like choir boys. Not an easy act to follow-but Nicholas Cage proves to be more than up to the task here.To my observation, Cage has demonstrated two basic personas in his repertoire over the years. First, there is the Slack-Jawed, Dead-eyed Mumbler (""Peggy Sue Got Married"", ""Moonstruck"", ""Red Rock West"", ""Leaving Las Vegas""). His other character is the Manic, Wild-eyed Loon (""Wild at Heart"", ""Raising Arizona"", ""Kiss of Death"", ""Face/Off""). Personally, I get a real kick out of his performances in the latter mode, and it goes without saying that you can now add the role of ""bad"" Lt. Terence McDonagh to that section of his resume.As far as I could glean, there is no effort to bridge with Ferrara's film and explain how Lt. McDonagh transitioned from NYC to New Orleans. Not that it really matters. Anyone who has followed Herzog's career probably has figured out by now that he is perfectly content to wallow in his own peculiar universe. Not that this is necessarily a bad thing-it's what makes his work so continually interesting to me. The ""plot"" ostensibly concerns itself with the murder of a Senegalese family, and the police investigation. Not that the ""plot"" really matters, either (although Herzog's post-Katrina milieu is quite atmospheric).No, if you are going to watch this film (which has ""destined to become a midnight cult item"" written all over it), I'll tell you right now that you needn't concern yourself with trying to follow the (probably deliberately) convoluted and complex murder mystery. You'll be too busy asking yourself questions like ""Did I just see what I think I just saw?"" and making exclamations like ""Oh no-he DIDN'T!"" as Herzog and screenwriter William M. Finkelstein proceed to turn the ""cop on the edge"" genre on its head with every blackly comic twist and turn. Cage and the rest of the cast (including Val Kilmer, Eva Mendes, Fairuza Balk, Brad Dourif and Jennifer Coolidge) all seem to be in on the director's joke, and play it to the hilt. By the time you've processed Herzog's use of the ""alligator/iguana-cam"", you will have to make a decision to either run for the exit, or go with the flow and say to yourself ""Well...I've bought the ticket, I'm gonna take the ride.""This is easily the most twisted noir I've seen since ""Tough Guys Don't Dance"". So do I think you should rush out and see this? That depends. If you are looking for a refreshing alternative to the usual Hollywood offerings, by all means, knock yourself out. But don't say I didn't warn you-if you don't consider an inspired line like ""Shoot him again-his soul is still dancing!"" to be pure genius, then you'd best keep away.",4,Fear and loathing in New Orleans,1268697600,"03 16, 2010",2010,3388,"['Who', 'could', 'have', 'guessed', 'man', 'who', 'helmed', 'art', 'house', 'classics', 'Fitzcarraldo', 'Woyzeck', 'Aguirre', 'Wrath', 'God', 'would', 'one', 'day', 'make', 'film', 'entitled', 'Bad', 'Lieutenant', 'Port', 'Call-New', 'Orleans', 'Then', 'again', 'one', 'might', 'argue', 'iconoclastic', 'Werner', 'Herzog', 'career', 'would', 'be', 'nothing', 'not', 'perennially', 'unpredictable.Herzog', 'latest', 'film', 'arguably', 'adorned', 'year', 'most', 'unwieldy', 'title', 'squeezing', 'marquee', 'sort', 'sequel', 'Abel', 'Ferrara', 'controversial', '1992', 'neo-noir', 'Bad', 'Lieutenant', 'was', 'drug', 'gambling-addicted', 'NYC', 'homicide', 'investigator', 'film', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'gave', 'fearless', 'maniacal', 'performance', 'cop', 'edge', 'who', 'made', 'most', 'criminals', 'was', 'paid', 'apprehend', 'look', 'choir', 'boys', 'Not', 'easy', 'act', 'follow-but', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'be', 'more', 'up', 'task', 'here.To', 'observation', 'Cage', 'demonstrated', 'two', 'basic', 'personas', 'repertoire', 'years', 'First', 'Slack-Jawed', 'Dead-eyed', 'Mumbler', 'Peggy', 'Sue', 'Got', 'Married', 'Moonstruck', 'Red', 'Rock', 'West', 'Leaving', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'other', 'character', 'Manic', 'Wild-eyed', 'Loon', 'Wild', 'Heart', 'Raising', 'Arizona', 'Kiss', 'Death', 'Face/Off', 'Personally', 'get', 'real', 'kick', 'performances', 'latter', 'mode', 'saying', 'can', 'now', 'add', 'role', 'bad', 'Lt.', 'Terence', 'McDonagh', 'section', 'resume.As', 'far', 'could', 'glean', 'effort', 'bridge', 'Ferrara', 'film', 'explain', 'how', 'Lt.', 'McDonagh', 'transitioned', 'NYC', 'New', 'Orleans', 'Not', 'really', 'matters', 'Anyone', 'who', 'followed', 'Herzog', 'career', 'probably', 'figured', 'out', 'now', 'perfectly', 'content', 'wallow', 'own', 'peculiar', 'universe', 'Not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing-it', 'what', 'work', 'so', 'continually', 'interesting', 'plot', 'ostensibly', 'murder', 'Senegalese', 'family', 'police', 'investigation', 'Not', 'plot', 'really', 'matters', 'either', 'Herzog', 'post-Katrina', 'milieu', 'quite', 'atmospheric', '.No', 'are', 'going', 'watch', 'film', 'destined', 'become', 'midnight', 'cult', 'item', 'written', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'right', 'now', 'need', ""n't"", 'concern', 'trying', 'follow', 'probably', 'deliberately', 'convoluted', 'complex', 'murder', 'mystery', ""'ll"", 'be', 'too', 'busy', 'asking', 'questions', 'Did', 'just', 'see', 'what', 'think', 'just', 'saw', 'making', 'exclamations', 'Oh', 'no-he', 'DID', ""N'T"", 'Herzog', 'screenwriter', 'William', 'M.', 'Finkelstein', 'proceed', 'turn', 'cop', 'edge', 'genre', 'head', 'blackly', 'comic', 'twist', 'turn', 'Cage', 'rest', 'cast', 'including', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'Fairuza', 'Balk', 'Brad', 'Dourif', 'Jennifer', 'Coolidge', 'seem', 'be', 'director', 'joke', 'play', 'hilt', 'time', ""'ve"", 'processed', 'Herzog', 'use', 'alligator/iguana-cam', 'will', 'have', 'make', 'decision', 'run', 'exit', 'go', 'flow', 'say', 'Well', ""'ve"", 'bought', 'ticket', ""'m"", 'gon', 'take', 'ride', 'easily', 'most', 'twisted', 'noir', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Tough', 'Guys', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Dance', 'So', 'do', 'think', 'should', 'rush', 'out', 'see', 'are', 'looking', 'refreshing', 'alternative', 'usual', 'Hollywood', 'offerings', 'means', 'knock', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'warn', 'you-if', 'do', ""n't"", 'consider', 'inspired', 'line', 'Shoot', 'again-his', 'soul', 'still', 'dancing', 'be', 'pure', 'genius', 'then', ""'d"", 'best', 'keep', 'away']",N/A

It's ""sort of"" because they've set this version in New Orleans, I guess because of its reputation as sin city.  It's also sort of because this bad lieutenant isn't really the totally corrupt person the original one was. In fact, when they have him do things inspired by the original, they don't come off as probable because Nicholas Cage simply doesn't exude the stench of rottenness that Harvey Keitel did to perfection.  What's worse is that Cage is not only not rotten, he's also not capable of looking at himself and repenting, which Keitel's character did in spades.  Even worse is that the new bad lieutenant gets no punishment for his crimes.  Nor does Lady Luck abandon him.  In short, this movies lacks the morality and moral of the original.  Then, too, the original was a tightly knit, suspenseful movie that keeps you glued to the screen.  This version is long and meandering so that I at least kept wishing it would end.

The reviews on the original theatrical release were all over the place. Add to that the New Orleans setting as opposed to the New York setting. Werner Herzog as opposed to Abel Ferrara. Nick Cage as opposed to Harvey Keitel. I suppose it's amazing this ever got made to begin with.That being said I approached it with an open mind and I'm still not certain what to think. It wasn't bad by any means but it was weird. It rather follows the original in that you have a cop gone bad who has problems with drugs and gambling and uses his position to shake down bad guys to help feed his bad habits. But here you see that Cage is good guy down deep. He saves a trapped prisoner from drowning in a cell in the aftermath of Katrina and seems genuinely wanting to solve a mass execution style murder. He also has an ""escort"" girlfriend to whom he supplies drugs but who he also defends when trouble knocks.Anyway........the hole gets deeper and deeper and you know things are going to come to a nasty head as he struggles to develop a scheme to right the entire mess. I can't spoil what happens but let it be said this takes one of the most peculiar turns I've ever seen in a movie. And what happens seems to be real and not just Cage's pipe dream.I guess this threw me to the point having to ask myself what Herzog was trying to say. I'm certain there must be some subtext I missed or something, but it seemed to revolve around Kharma, (I suppose).Anyway.....All the aspects of the film are professional. The acting is good (though I do wish Eva Mendez had a bit more to do) and all the cinematography, edittng, music score, etc., are all good. And though it is 2 hours long, I didn't find myself looking at my watch so there's something to be said on that note.So.....I suppose I'm on the fence but leaning to the ""liking it"" side. Maybe it shouldn't be the top of your rental list, but don't be afraid of it either. Maybe it hasn't given up all it's charms yet and one or two more viewings might help me ""get it.""",3,Pretty Good.......I suppose,1271721600,"04 20, 2010",2010,2083,"['did', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'when', 'popped', 'DVD', 'player', 'reviews', 'original', 'theatrical', 'release', 'were', 'place', 'Add', 'New', 'Orleans', 'setting', 'as', 'opposed', 'New', 'York', 'setting', 'Werner', 'Herzog', 'opposed', 'Abel', 'Ferrara', 'Nick', 'Cage', 'opposed', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'suppose', 'amazing', 'ever', 'got', 'made', 'begin', 'with.That', 'being', 'said', 'approached', 'open', 'mind', ""'m"", 'still', 'not', 'certain', 'what', 'think', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'means', 'was', 'weird', 'rather', 'original', 'have', 'cop', 'gone', 'bad', 'who', 'problems', 'drugs', 'gambling', 'position', 'shake', 'down', 'bad', 'guys', 'help', 'feed', 'bad', 'habits', 'here', 'see', 'Cage', 'good', 'guy', 'down', 'deep', 'trapped', 'prisoner', 'drowning', 'cell', 'aftermath', 'Katrina', 'genuinely', 'wanting', 'solve', 'mass', 'execution', 'style', 'murder', 'also', 'escort', 'girlfriend', 'whom', 'drugs', 'who', 'also', 'when', 'trouble', 'knocks.Anyway', '..the', 'hole', 'deeper', 'deeper', 'know', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'come', 'nasty', 'head', 'develop', 'scheme', 'right', 'entire', 'mess', 'ca', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'what', 'let', 'be', 'said', 'one', 'most', 'peculiar', 'turns', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'what', 'be', 'real', 'not', 'just', 'Cage', 'pipe', 'dream.I', 'guess', 'threw', 'point', 'having', 'ask', 'what', 'Herzog', 'was', 'trying', 'say', ""'m"", 'certain', 'must', 'be', 'subtext', 'missed', 'something', 'seemed', 'revolve', 'Kharma', 'suppose', '.Anyway', 'aspects', 'film', 'are', 'professional', 'acting', 'good', 'do', 'wish', 'Eva', 'Mendez', 'had', 'bit', 'more', 'do', 'cinematography', 'edittng', 'music', 'score', 'etc.', 'are', 'good', '2', 'hours', 'long', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'looking', 'watch', 'something', 'be', 'said', 'note.So', '..I', 'suppose', ""'m"", 'fence', 'leaning', 'liking', 'side', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'top', 'rental', 'list', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'afraid', 'Maybe', ""n't"", 'given', 'up', 'charms', 'yet', 'one', 'two', 'more', 'viewings', 'might', 'help', 'get']",N/A

It baffles me that an actor of his caliber who does two or three film a year can't manage his funds. This movie is a weird one. Herzog was goin for a Fear and Loathing vibe but I wasn't feeling it. Cage's character is a PD Lieutenant who is addicted to drugs. He steals, gambles, and hustles people like he's a Tijuana cop. In reality no one that messed up would be a police detective. The movie has a very thin plot. It involves  murders, witnesses, a hooker girlfriend, drug dealers, mobsters, bookies ect. There's appearences by Val Kilmer, Eva Mendez, Xzibit, and a couple other familiar actors. This is just another of the many mediocre post Katrina New Orleans films. The only good one I can think of is ""Deja Vu"" with Denzel and Val Kilmer. (who also did the one with 50 cent). He must live in New Orleans. I reccomend this as a rental.

Add to that a post-Hurricane Katrina New Orleans and you've got some cinema that is, at the least, intriguing and, at the most, a wild, humid, corrupt-cop, gambling and drug-fueled ride.  Frankly, I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it.  Cage is at his best here.Cage plays Lt. Terence McDonagh.  At the beginning, he is, as far as the viewer can tell, a slightly corrupt cop.  In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, he and his partner (played by Val Kilmer) discover a locked up criminal about to be submerged by rising waters in an abandoned jail.  Despite his partner's desire to leave the prisoner to drown, McDonagh leaps into the water to unlock the man . . .CUT TOA doctor's office where Lt. McDonagh is getting a check up and is informed that his back--apparently injured when McDonagh leapt into the water--will always give him pain.  In the ensuing scenes, we get to see McDonagh taking copious amounts of drugs, meeting with his prostitute girlfriend (which he may or may not have had at the beginning of the movie), betting on sports, taking advantage of nightclubbing couples for sex and investigating the apparent drug-related death of a family.  The lengths that McDonagh goes to to solve the murders while simulataneously extracting himself from various precarious situations involving his addictions test the very limits of believability . . . but the ride is fantastic and enjoyable, particularly since Nicolas Cage gets crazier and crazier as everything comes to a head.The movie certainly won't be to everyone's tastes, but give it a chance.  You might be pleasantly surprised.  (I frankly thought it was a better cinematic endeavor than Abel Ferrara's ""Bad Lieutenant"" with Harvey Keitel.)  Interestingly, Val Kilmer is strangely absent throughout all but the beginning and end of the movie.  It would have been good to see more of him.

But you have to credit him with respect for his audience -- at least most of us -- in that he plainly expects us to recognize a spoof, to enjoy being 'sent up' as we watch our neuroses reflected and exploited. He gives us plenty of semiotic signals, the enigmatic animals that always show up, for instance. In ""The Bad Lieutenant"", the animals are a camera-conscious alligator, a Siamese fighting fish in a water glass, and a pair of iguanas that may or may not be appearing on the Lieutenant's table. Innocent viewers might be jived into supposing that Herzog's Lieutenant is hallucinating in reaction to his fantabulous intake of cocaine, crack cocaine, cannabis and inhaled heroin, but when the Lieutenant claims to see the soul of a plugged thug break-dancing over his body, I know that you know that Werner knows that neither cocaine nor heroin is hallucinogenic. He's gaming the genre, amigos! Much in the manner that the Coen Brothers game the genre habitually. But Herzog is also gaming his American audience, needling the comfortable  and the smug exploiting our insatiable thirst for vicarious violence and our addictions, both open and closeted. Or so I prefer to think ... If ""The Bad Lieutenant"" is not a sardonic spoof, if even one scene of it represents Herzog's vision of American reality, then either Herzog is a slanderer or America is a more disgusting cesspool of sociopathy than I want to believe.So let's, for our peace of mind, assume that ""The Bad Lieutenant"" is a comedy, though not of the laugh-out-loud variety. Then we can cosily regard the occasional quiddities of the script -- when the Lieutenant muses about whether fish dream, for example -- as deliberate miss-clues to the intentional meaninglessness of the film. Herzog is, after all, a professed nihilist, who has declared that the Universe is a godless and random place. To wrap up all the catastrophes looming over the Lieutenant in one quick scene replete with Dickens-worthy coincidences -- that is what happens, in an almost happy ending -- has to be recognized as the acme of snarky mockery of all cinema conventions.And Nicolas Cage plays along with Herzog's polymorphous perversity almost as convincingly in English as Klaus Kinski used to do in German. The Lieutenant has a bad back. I know what a bad back looks like and feels like. Cage does the bad back body-torque perfectly. He's too over-exposed, too familiar, to be effective as an actor in any role these days, but that's part of the schema of this film. All the other characters play generic ""noir"" without a wink.I've given this film five stars provisionally, in tribute to my own interpretation of it as a stealth spoof on America's sofa-bound paranoia.

I think a Herzog film is an acquired taste - the film will either seem brilliant, or really stupid, depending upon your liking or dis-liking for his style.  One thing is for certain, with a Herzog film, you will not be getting the same stale Hollywood film that panders to the masses.  It's very difficult to be neutral about a film like Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans. I suspect many people will find the film some kind of bizarre parody of a cop film.The film is very, very, loosely based on the original Bad Lieutenant (1992) starring Harvey Keitel (an incredibly great film).  In the new version, Nicolas Cage plays a drug-addicted, gambling-addicted, corrupt, violent, and insane cop who is the lead on a homicide case.  Along the way, he endangers his prostitute girlfriend, his father's dog, and almost everyone he knows.  At one point, under the influence of crack, Cage starts to hallucinate iguanas.

1288781,ATYVBUA5E1IDW,B002TVQ48A,Graham,"[1, 1]","It's nearly impossible to review a movie like this. In fact, it's highly unlikely that there has ever been another movie ""like this"". Simply put, Werner Herzog and Nicolas Cage have created one of the most bizarre films I have ever seen. This assessment is only strengthened upon the realization that Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call - New Orleans (for the purposes of this review I will just call it Bad Lieutenant) tells no real story, at least not the kind of story that people expect when they, you know, watch a movie with a plot and actors and everything else.First off I must warn you not to confuse this with Abel Ferrera's Bad Lieutenant, a dark and disturbing portrait of one man's downward spiral and quest for redemption. Harvey Keitel was absolutely riveting in the role and to this day, Bad Lieutenant stands as one of the most powerful films I have ever seen. A straight remake would have been an impossible task and luckily this new Bad Lieutenant shares only the most basic premise with its older cousin. Where as Ferrera's film chronicled one man's descent into hell and was about as pleasant as it sounds, Herzog's film is a zany, manic, and oftentimes hilarious cop drama/black comedy/police procedural. The two films really could not be anymore different -- the only reason they share a name is due to a producer tied to both projects. In case I haven't made it clear enough -- comparing the two films is pointless and should not be attempted.Nicolas Cage plays a, wait for it ... bad lieutenant in post-Katrina New Orleans. When we first meet him he is debating the merits of saving a drowning prisoner with his psychotic partner, played by Val Kilmer, who manages to make an impression in his brief amount of screen time. Against his partner's recommendation, Lt. McDonagh (for that is the bad lieutenant's name) jumps into the flood waters and saves the man. When we next see him six months later, he is a literal wreck, suffering from constant back pain due to the rescue attempt, and is addicted to seemingly every substance on earth. Cage has a ball with the character and Herzog allows all of the usual Cage quirks and idiosyncrasies to shine, resulting in one of the most bizarre characters and performances in recent memory. Cage stalks around New Orleans, one shoulder held contorted above the other due to the back pain, his eyes practically popping out of his head, all with a .44 Magnum stuck in his waistband. This is a man with a lucky crack pipe who spouts hip hop non-sequiters at random (""Til the break a dawn! Til the break a dawn!"") and frequently hallucinates that he is surrounded by iguanas. It is a thoroughly engrossing character, similar to a freak show member in a carnival, in that try as you might, you simply can't look away. The film's plot, if you could call it that, doesn't really warrant a discussion. This is not because the plot is terrible (it isn't), but because if you focus on the plot and other traditional elements of film making, you're really missing the point of Bad Lieutenant altogether.Herzog has a reputation for getting the ""crazy"" out of his actors and obviously this film is no exception, although the lion's share of the credit must go to Nicolas Cage, an actor as frustrating in the display of his considerable talents as any I can think of. For the most part, Cage has waltzed through the past two decades releasing such dreck as Next, the National Treasure movies, Bangkok Dangerous, and The Wicker Man (which just may be the worst film of the past quarter-century). His roles in many of these films are characterized by record-setting overacting and the familiar ""crazy look"" of Nicolas Cage. This is the ""bad"" Nicolas Cage. After awhile, I think we all began to think that perhaps Cage was simply playing himself. Perhaps he really was a world-class nut-job. However, every once in awhile he released a film to remind us that deep beneath the frequently terrible hair and generic action roles is a highly talented actor with nigh-unstoppable range. Just take a look at Moonstruck, Raising Arizona, Leaving Las Vegas, or Adaptation to see the ""good"" Nicolas Cage. Which brings us to his role as Lt. Terence McDonagh in Bad Lieutenant. What makes Cage's performance so interesting (aside from the bizarre physical characteristics he lent to the role), is that what we have here is essentially ""good"" Nicolas Cage playing ""bad"" Nicolas Cage, all within the confines of the story, and he totally nails it. The performance is simultaneously hilarious and frightening and Cage owns every second that he is on screen.I could go on to discuss the rest of the cast, or the film's bleached look or any other aspect of the film, but in all honesty this is a movie centered around one performance, one actor, and one man.

Before that there was a long break and I remember weird stuff with Klaus Kinski (Fitzcarraldo; Aguirre; Ouida), and wasn't there a Kaspar Hauser version?Anyway, the man is rather crazy, and this film with the crazy Mr.Cage stays true to form. Superficially a cop story set in post Katrina New Orleans, we might retell it as if it was a straightforward one: a police sergeant gets promoted to lieutenant for valiant actions during Katrina, which also caused him back problems and drug addictions. At the end he gets promoted some more. In the meantime he chases killers and drug dealers and at the same time he uses his cop power to steal drugs from his `customers' as well as from the police storage room. He is indebted to bookies and he shares his consumption habits with his girlfriend who spends her own working life in the meat trade. His father is an ex cop and AA activist, his stepmother an unabashed beer drinker. Such a happy family of addicts!Cage's character's luck seems to turn on him when he faces two short term payment demands, one of them from a gang of very violent men. He also seems to run into trouble, at last, with his employer, after running into the wrong targets for his own bullying on the job. It is not a good idea to antagonize people with connections.But don't expect Herzog to stay within the rules of realistic narration. There are scenes of outright weirdness, often involving animals. The camera once follows the world with the eyes of an alligator, or rather the camera is mounted on the gator's head. Or Cage, most of the time high, sees iguanas in his room, where nobody else sees anything. That is, we see them of course. Or a man needs to be shot twice, since his soul will not stop breakdancing after the first shooting.The plot line is also not exactly strictly logical. One has the impression that Herzog suddenly gets impatient with the direction of the plot and he screws up conventional logic to turn the story into some kind of surrealistic comedy.My personal opinion on him: he is just an eccentric with technical and artistic skills. Don't even try to see anything  deeper in his products.

I won't tell you why, but you'll know soon enough if you give this sleeper of a movie a chance and watch Nicholas Cage do his acting thing in the Bad Lieutenant. Many people love him or hate him, but given the right material and the freedom to create, he can indeed surprise. I think he had a hand in inventing this role and maybe the director gave him a lot of leeway; because his character dominates every frame of this movie.And there's more good news. It's a taught and suspenseful thriller for those of you who love the crime, suspense and murder genre. Here we have to give Herzog accolades, the director, for choosing the setting (New Orleans), the music and the scenes. Certainly a bizarre thinker himself based on some of his other films. But in Bad he has woven together a frightening dilemma for our hero. Now that I think about it, we don't care too much about Cage, but we do care about those that surround him. That's a peculiarity, maybe a weakness of the story; why people like him. But some do and in the end I do, too. He's not a very likable sort at all and that's an understatement, but he is startling and hysterical; a dark, cheerless barrel of monkeys when he is high. You won't want to meet him otherwise.So, that's good news for many of you Californians, who love some of the weed. There is much in this story for you to rejoice in and relate to as it examines, fictionally perhaps, the underbelly of the use and abuse of recreational and pharmaceutical drugs in a hopelessly desolate city. I don't think the New Orleans Visitors Bureau woud approve of Herzog's depiction of their city. Though he does it artfully.I looked into this movie because Ebert gave it high marks. I might have ignored it because of Cage otherwise. He can be too `cagey' in films, especially in recent action-type flicks. But he is great in this one, over the top, as they say. The other characters are acted wonderfully and are as lovable as new born puppies - just kidding. You will find most of them repulsive and comical and you'll love to hate them.

1288791,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,B002TVQ48A,J from NY,"[1, 1]","While I'm not sure anything could equal Abel Ferrara's masterpiece ""Bad Lieutenant"" (and the viewer should not go into this movie expecting that), Herzog's ""Port of Call New Orleans"" is more than worth the time of those interested in seeing the offbeat director's skillful use of Nicolas Cage as Terence McDonaugh, a corrupt New Orleans detective with so many life threatening problems (drug addiction, gambling addiction, debt to mafioso) that the threat of immanent death is something that he's accustomed to.While none of this particularly shocked me (Nicolas Cage has talent but I could never buy him as a genuine tough guy), I found it hilarious, uncanny, and filled with mystery in a really strange way.  In the same vein as Ferrara's tour de force--an absolute wretch looking for redemption or at least occasionally trying not to be a monster--and employing extreme surreality to a purpose.  The love among the damned bit (Terence has a drug addict prostitute for a girlfriend who looks a little too good for her job, played by the gorgeous Eva Mendes) is not cliche and Herzog uses it to comical effect more than anything else.  The sense of displacement and dislocation in Terence's narcotic addled, deranged psyche is used to maximum effect in bits of dialogue that are priceless.  A mobster obviously modeled on the late John Gotti fondles his girlfriend, threatening him viciously, and then says: ""When one touches another physically it is a reminder, Terence, that we are not alone.  Not completely.""His anger at the elderly obviously has something to do with his reformed alcoholic father.  The linear plot of the movie which is the least important aspect of the film is thus: Terence is enraged by the brutal gangland slaying of a family and a little girl over some money.  He reads in the little girl's diary: ""When my fish sleeps, it dreams.""  This is a recurrent theme and sets him on an inner quest, when he isn't quaffing drugs from wayward youngsters at nightclubs. Because of the death of this child and her note he seeks to understand his own youth and come to terms with his almost certain death.  He returns home to his father and searches for the spoon he once found as a child while looking for booty like a Pirate.  He will ""sleep with the fishes"", yes, but will he dream?  Will there be any innocence or purity left in his wretched life?The way he apprehends those responsible for the family's death is so confusing that occasionally the viewer wonders whether he has become entirely depraved.  But no, his ""lucky crackpipe"" saves the day. Is his success at the end a dream?  Did he actually die?  Did the man he saved at the beginning get him help, or are they both ""sleeping like the fishes"" in the closing sequence?Brad Dourif plays a low level loan shark for the mob, but he is really Terence's priest.  He urges Terence to do something to save himself and echoes with his own performance the Catholicism of Ferrara's film.  Val Kilmer is hilarious as his partner who is just a guy's guy and wants to help out his friend at any cost, but is also badly influenced by him.

1288792,A1M1Y5UGONAW06,B002TVQ48A,Jody,"[1, 1]","In Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans, Nicholas Cage plays a quintessential Cage character as the self-destructive coke-head Terence McDonagh.  His investigation into the drug related murder of an entire family and his need to fuel his habit takes him into some odd places, his path crossing those of even odder characters.  And iguanas.  The supporting cast supplies familiar faces and the secondary plots that converge into the surprising and gleeful conclusion.McDonagh's plummet to rock bottom during the dark and sordid first half of this movie is difficult to watch, but is the necessary set up for the astonishing events of the second.  Val Kilmer, Jennifer Coolidge, Brad Dourif and Eva Mendes turn in fine performances as the secondary characters fueling McDonagh's quandaries and dilemmas.  As McDonagh's character is further revealed, we see that he's more than the first half would indicate and some very dark humor begins to surface.I've been struggling with what to say about Bad Lieutenant.  Describing it as Robert Altman making a movie with the Coen brothers gives a sense of its surreal noir-ness, but isn't fair to Mr. Herzog.  I wouldn't describe this as a fun movie, or even a pleasant one, and inside Herzog's head is an interesting place to be if you don't have to spend a lot of time there. If you can make it through the dancing soul, it's worth sticking with this movie to the end, though not everyone will want to.

I was going to say &#34;parable.&#34; While the story lines are at odds, both directors put their money on the main character, the cop.His manic actions and their ultimate fate are what keeps everyone guessing, and Cage's dazzling performance keeps us engaged. So do the outstand supporting cast. (I can say the same for Keitel and the actors he worked with. Quality-wise, these Bad Lieutenants are in the same league, and for copy movie buffs, that is a very exclusive league.)This isn't a think piece. Don't let the overly neat resolution of some elements sour you -- Heroz is having a little laugh here. He injects humor and even a little fantasy in several places, and if you don't overthink the movie but rather let the story carry you along, the eccentric elements only add to the atmosphere of post-Katrina New Orleans: a haunted place with new ghosts added every day.If you lean toward Cage's intensity, I think you'll find it's been put to good use here by one of the industry's veteran directors.

1288796,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B002TVQ48A,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[9, 13]","It's worth noting that I'm familiar with the work of Werner Herzog, but I'm no aficionado on his career or film work. I have not seen all of his movies and the few I have seen I've only seen once. With that said a remake of Abel Ferrara's gritty, powerful dramaBad Lieutenantdid not seem the most obvious film for the famed German director to make. Minutes into the film I realized I was watching something very different from Ferrara's movie and Herzog's insistence that this film is not a remake is more than correct. The two films are only similar in title and in the fact they have a crooked cop at the center of it all. The way the material is handled, as well as the story itself is completely different and while Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call, New Orleans will get just as much criticism as acclaim, it should not be compared directly to the original film.The film opens in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Nicolas Cage plays Terence McDonagh, who saves a drowning prisoner and winds up with severe back problems. He's prescribed vicodin and six months later he's been promoted to lieutenant and picked up a cocaine habit. The story involves five people being killed execution-style in a drug-related homicide and Terence investigating it while stealing drugs from the property room, misusing his power as lieutenant for sex, and all other sorts of ""bad"" things.Eva Mendes plays Frankie, a prostitute and Terence's girlfriend, while Val Kilmer appears here and there as Terence's partner Stevie. The film has many other well-known actors popping up such as Brad Dourif (as Terence's bookie), Fairuza Balk, Michael Shannon, and Xzibit.Ferrara's Bad Lieutenant didn't have much of a plot...The story just sort of followed the lieutenant through his downward spiral of depravity. Herzog's follows his lieutenant through a story while illustrating his depravity; which, I'd argue, isn't quite as depraved as the original. This film does borrow some of the elements of that previous film, but if you were to drop the title you'd realize this is a completely different film.The film, aside from being glossier than the gritty original film, also has no problem going completely over-the-top or lurching over into something random and weird. The ""iguana scene"" is so ridiculously random, yet it gives this film it's own unique stamp in a way. I haven't seen many movies by Herzog but there are some creative touches which could have only come from his mind; the scene with the iguana and the scene with the alligator for example. Despite Herzog being a terrific, highly respected director I'm not sure he was taking his work here entirely seriously here opting for having fun rather than making a masterpiece.Performance-wise, Nicolas Cage can not match the soul-bearing performance by Harvey Keitel. A lot of people don't like Nicolas Cage at all; I think with the right material that Nicolas Cage is one of the greatest actors working today, never better than when he's playing a character that's completely unhinged. Terence McDonagh is a great role for him and no one besides Cage would've interpreted the character in this way. However, his performance is not flawless. While entertaining and fun to watch, there are some creative choices I'm not sure about such as when Cage's accent fades to a different accent mid-way through the movie for no apparent reason. The performances all over-the-top in one way or another, although Kilmer and Shannon are pretty subdued over all. No one will win an Oscar for acting in this film, but they make their character's fun to watch.The film has some good cinematography and Herzog picked some great locations to film; the film has a film-noir quality at times, but the musical score by Mark Isham didn't fit with the overall tone at times. Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call, New Orleans works as entertainment, but it didn't draw me in the way the first did. Ferrara's film is a tragedy, a compelling character study and morality tale. Herzog's film is a comedy, entertaining and unique. I'm not sure there's a point in telling this story without the morality or redemptive aspect to it. As I said though, I will not base my enjoyment of this film off of how it compares to the other.This film is marvelously weird and the pairing of Herzog and Cage, both known for being quirky in their professions, is a match well-made. What other director would have a shoot-out scene where the main character says, after a few people are shot, ""Shoot him again; his soul's still dancing?"" And who, aside from Cage, could say such a line? Furthermore, who would actually film the dancing soul? It's not a perfect film and it's not the masterpiece a few critics have called it. It does deserve to stand-alone from the Ferrara film and hopefully those who watch this film will be lead to watch the original. There will be those who absolutely loathe this film and that's to be expected. Over-the-top, ridiculous, and unique; I found it hard not to be amused and entertained. The first film left me shaken and stunned, this film left me shaking my head at how a similar story could be handled in such a different way.GRADE: B-",4,"Entertaining, But Lacking the Depth of

Cause this movie was poorly done it has no right to have the name Bad Lieutenant. In fact Abel Ferrara openly against this movie. Werner Herzog said ""I have no idea who he is I've never seen a film of his."" Yeah you must of known enough to direct a sequel. I mean I don't blame Abel Ferrara for being mad I mean Bad Lieutenant which I reviewed the other day is a great character piece. This movie is way to long too slow paced & the acting isn't all that great the editing is bad. Made on a budget of $25 million made $10 million. Directed by Werner Herzog he directed Nosferetu & Rescue Dawn. Rescue Dawn is better than this movie. If you like this movie that's fine anytime I rant on a movie it's against the movie not the fans. This won't be a huge rant but still I don't care for this movie. It stars Nichols Cage as Terrence McDonagh, Val Kilmer as Stevie Pruit, Eva Mendes as Frankie Donnenfeld, Xzibit as Big Fate & Brad Dourif Ned. The story is Terrence McDonagh & his partner Stevie Purit are investigating a murder of this family who are illegal immigrants from Senegal. Their looking for this guy named Big Fate. You have them copy stuff off of the original Bad Lieutenant you have the lead doing drugs & betting on sports only this time it's College Football. He has a girlfriend he does drugs with. This character isn't interesting Nicholas Cage doesn't make it work not saying that Nicholas Cage is a bad actor but this isn't his kind of movie. Keitel was over the top in the in Bad Lieutenant but he didn't over do it. You have a scene where up to this young couple & starts messing with them like with the 2 Jersey Girls in in the original. He has s  e  x with the girl & takes her drugs. Lieutenant McDonagh & Lieutenant Pruit round up different people they find this boy who was a witness to the murders. McDonagh gets a call from his Girlfriend Frankie to come to Biloxi the witness goes with him & McDonagh finds out that this guy has been beating her he beats that guy up who tells him that he's well connected. They get back to New Orleans at this restraunt the witness goes missing & McDonagh goes to that guys Grandma's House she takes care of this elderly lady. He gets mad cause they won't tell him where the boy went to he goes off the deep end cuts off the old lady's oxegen so he can get some information. I'm sorry but that's way too over the top even for me. He is told that the boy went to England. So this plot point goes nowhere. All this cop does is get himself in more trouble which I will get to. He gets a call by Frankie cause he owes money to this mobster dude he has 2 days to pay up. He gets Frankie out of town has her stay with his  parents there is this dramatic BS going on with McDonagh's Father & Step Mother which I didn't care about. When the 1st movie the simple things & straight forward things did so much more for me. McDonagh has been put on modified duty for his recent actions. That's ok cause he has a guy that works evidence that will get his gun back for him. McDonagh shows Frankie this old tool shed he used to play in as a kid & it's more stuff that could've been cut out. He goes on & on about this spoon he dug up in the yard as a kid. McDonagh gets together with Big Fate's crew he uses them to help him take down those mob guys he owes money to. McDonagh has Big Fate smoke his Lucky Crack Pipe so he can get his DNA. I will admit that I did find his plan brillant use them to kill the people he owes money get that guys DNA to get him arrested. He has the pipe planted at the crime scene where that family was killed & Big Fate & his gang are busted. McDonagh's partner Stevie wants to kill Big Fate & take his drugs but McDonagh wants to take him in. So for performing his duties professionally he is promoted to Captain & he Frankie his father & step mother are clean & sober. Frankie is pregnet. Oh but McDonagh still has his slip up lol. Bad Lieutenant Port Of S  h  i  t is poorly done I know it's not a direct sequel but even as a stand alone movie it's no different than any other crime drama movie on the direct to video market. It's 2 hours & 2 minutes too long 10 or 15  could've been cut out of it the acting isn't much to run home about. Werner Herzog gets the pass for being a high brow director.

I generally think Cage is one of the most overrated actors out there, but he kept me interested here, and has moments of near genius. Herzog likewise; he slips a few times but all in all this feels like a good Hollywood crime flick that goes off the rails time and again into a weird zone all its own.There is a massive amount of overt coke use here without the usual celluloid sanitization, and it's a pretty accurate depiction of what a dick that crap usually turns people into. The worst parts are the overlong lizard hallucinations, but then again the best are nearby, when Cage smokes crack and freaks out. He is verrry convincing in those, well able to really let go into briefly psychotic mania, making one wonder how much rock ol' Nick incinerated during the years of his excesses. Those scenes are completely gripping in their intense weirdness, and the black gang members are all very solid and convincing. Whatever plot holes are here, and there are a few, get steamrolled by the intensity of the best scenes.In fact most of the acting here is above average, and except for a few moments of lame dialogue this movie has a raw, real feel that truly does smell like Nawlins, in all its tragic beauty and grime.While no masterpiece, Bad Looey has enough positives and unique vibe to make it well worth watching for fans of Cage, Herzog, The Big Not-So-Easy, bizarre edginess, or cop flicks in general.",4,Very entertaining despite its various flaws,1271116800,"04 13, 2010",2010,1444,"['liked', 'more', 'expected', 'generally', 'think', 'Cage', 'one', 'most', 'overrated', 'actors', 'there', 'kept', 'interested', 'here', 'moments', 'near', 'genius', 'Herzog', 'likewise', 'few', 'times', 'feels', 'good', 'Hollywood', 'crime', 'flick', 'rails', 'time', 'again', 'weird', 'zone', 'massive', 'amount', 'overt', 'coke', 'use', 'here', 'usual', 'celluloid', 'sanitization', 'pretty', 'accurate', 'depiction', 'what', 'dick', 'usually', 'turns', 'people', 'worst', 'parts', 'are', 'overlong', 'lizard', 'hallucinations', 'then', 'again', 'best', 'are', 'nearby', 'when', 'Cage', 'crack', 'out', 'verrry', 'convincing', 'well', 'able', 'really', 'let', 'go', 'briefly', 'psychotic', 'mania', 'making', 'one', 'wonder', 'how', 'much', 'rock', 'ol', 'Nick', 'incinerated', 'years', 'excesses', 'scenes', 'are', 'completely', 'gripping', 'intense', 'weirdness', 'black', 'gang', 'members', 'are', 'very', 'solid', 'convincing', 'plot', 'holes', 'are', 'here', 'are', 'few', 'get', 'steamrolled', 'intensity', 'best', 'scenes.In', 'fact', 'most', 'acting', 'here', 'above', 'average', 'few', 'moments', 'lame', 'dialogue', 'movie', 'raw', 'real', 'feel', 'truly', 'smell', 'Nawlins', 'tragic', 'beauty', 'grime.While', 'masterpiece', 'Bad', 'Looey', 'enough', 'positives', 'unique', 'vibe', 'make', 'well', 'watching', 'fans', 'Cage', 'Herzog', 'Big', 'Not-So-Easy', 'bizarre', 'edginess', 'cop', 'flicks', 'general']",N/A

(This takes place in the context of the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.)2. We see him doing things like sticking up club patrons for their drugs and then taking them and snorting them up himself.3. He has a hooker girlfriend who is mistreated by a John (she snorts almost as much dope as he does), and to whose rescue Bad Lieutenant comes-- but at the price of upsetting a group of small time mobsters that hold him responsible for $50,000.4. There is also a murder of a family of Haitians that needs to be resolved (this is actually what starts the film).5. The cop finds a Witness To The Murder, who is afraid to testify lest he be killed. The people who were murdered were also affiliated with drug dealers, who left no evidence.6. Witness to the Murder disappears, but we later find out that he has gone to England-- but this is only after this drug crazed cop pulls a gun on an old woman in a wheelchair to extract a confession.7. Eventually, the cop strikes a deal with a Big Drug Dealer for protection in exchange for cash and dope.8. Just as this deal is being clinched, mobsters-to-whom-Bad-Lieutenant-owes-money walk in to collect their money (and foolishly decide to rob the Big Drug Dealer at the same time).9. The Big Drug Dealer and cop kill them all and this creates enough evidence for the cop to plant at the murder scene to indict the Big Drug Dealer who murdered the family.10. Aftermath: Cop takes hooker out of business and has a baby with her, but is later seen sticking up bar patrons for drugs again. The end.Comments:This film was OK (I mean, if someone paid to have Nicholas Cage act in a film, there is a limit to how bad that film could be-- at least theoretically).

It's a reconception of the ""bad cop"" concept in post-Katrina New Orleans. Lt. Terence McDonaugh (Nicolas Cage), a homicide detective with the NOPD, keeps himself going by dosing Vicodin for his chronic back pain, which leads to heroin, cocaine, crack, and, by the time he is called upon to investigate the massacre of a Senegalese family, any mind-altering substance he can get his hands on. Terence tracks down the killers, creatively abuses his power to obtain enough drugs to sustain him, gambles, threatens honest citizens, rescues his prostitute girlfriend Frankie (Eva Mendes), and weaves such a tangled web of corruption that it's doubtful a crackhead cop could keep track of it all.I wonder to what extent this was intended as parody. Ostensibly, we have a police officer, a sort of crooked cop with a conscience stuck in an existential nightmare, whose bad habits are way out of control and whose world is crashing in on him: his victims are filing complaints, his gambling debts are due, goons are threatening him, and he has to babysit his alcoholic father's dog, while conducting a murder investigation. Terence has managed to stay one step ahead of his troubles through sheer audacity. But he's a lunatic. It can't last. There are some goofy reptile's-eye-view shots that director Werner Herzog must have intended to make fun of the characters. But how much of the rest of it was supposed to be funny? Nicolas Cage isn't acting. He's doing shtick, and he's barely doing that.The murder suspects come from out of nowhere. In fact, there is a lot of inattention to detail and continuity, where characters do and say things that don't fit. The dialogue is so bad that, with my eyes closed, I would swear this is a low-budget exploitation flick. Terence's drug-addled rants and rampages are so bizarre that no one would take him seriously. They'd have him committed. His indiscretions eventually congeal into a plot so absurd that I didn't know what to make of it. Watching ""Bad Lieutenant"", there were times when I was almost certain it was intended as a joke. Then it seemed to desperately want to be taken seriously. Then back to silliness. Whatever it is, it's not worth 2 hours of anyone's time. This is one of the 10 worst movies I've ever seen.

It doesn't seem to be getting much play around the country and will likely hit DVD before most people can witness this strange little gem. I read some really positive reviews from critics and movie watchers alike, so I figured I would give it a shot. I haven't been a fan of Nicolas Cage for a long time, mainly because he seems to be taking every bad movie and turning in a subpar performance. Now that we know he has money problems in real life, it at least makes sense now. I'm happy to say the he is back in top form here. His character is as bad as Denzel Washington's in Training Day and he is played in the same over the top way, without seeming to be unbelievable. He has a hunched back and carries his .44 magnum in the front of his pants wherever he goes. Most of the characters in Bad Lieutenant are predictable scum, but Cage throws so much into this performance that you really have no clue what's going to happen from one scene to the next. He is at his crazy best here and reminded me that few people can play weird as well as this man. Eva Mendes is looking pretty good here and her acting is decent, but her role doesn't amount to much other than a slight bright spot for Cage's loose cannon. Val Kilmer shows up and is quite good, but he is barely in the movie. Maybe five minutes tops.On the negative side, this film is very dark and often mean, but thankfully some humor forces it's way through in some of these scenes. There are also some bizarre visuals, such as a point of view shot from an alligator and another from a couple of iguanas for no reason at all. A few scenes also linger on a bit to long and the pacing slows at times, but I was sucked into this corrupt man's life and couldn't keep my eyes off the screen.

1288815,A18SDN3HYFVH2L,B002TVQ48A,Muzzlehatch,"[1, 2]","I went into this not having read too much about it really, and not knowing just how much it had to do with Abel Ferrara's 1992 film-with-part-of-the-same name.  I loved that film when it came out, and probably ought to revisit it, but in the meantime this Werner Herzog ""re-imagining"" or whatever one wants to call it isn't half-bad in it's own right, though I'm not entirely sure if it's really special either.  Not an easy film to get to the heart of after just one viewing, but I'll give it a try.The basic plot does mirror the earlier film in its essentials - an (apparently) once-good cop (nameless, and inhabited with ferocious anguish by Harvey Keitel in the earlier film) spirals downward over the course of a few days due to drug addiction, gambling debts, obsessions with women and allowing all of this personal stuff to get in the way of a difficult murder/drug case.  But whereas the earlier film had an awful lot of Christian symbolism and was fairly obviously the work of someone with a difficult relationship with Catholicism, Werner Herzog's film eschews religion, and also humanizes Lt Terrence McDonagh (Nicolas Cage), giving him not only a name but (possibly) a rationale for his behavior, which may feel more realistic but is also, ultimately, a bit problematic.  Herzog as always is more interested in man's relationship with his environment and his obsessions than with his faith.At the beginning of the film McDonagh and his partner Stevie (Val Kilmer) are searching a jail in the aftermath of Katrina.  They're doing a lot of joking, and McDonagh grabs a fellow cop's dirty pictures, but nothing seems really out of place.  Then they come across a prisoner locked in a cage that is slowly flooding.  They laugh and joke about it and seem as if they're just going to let the guy drown, but then McDonagh jumps in to save him.  Cut to a few months later - McDonagh is on heavy doses of vicodin for a back injury he suffered in the rescue, has been promoted to Lieutenant, and is also a heavy user of coke and is involved with high-priced hooker Frankie (Eva Mendes).  The thing that's interesting is that we don't know - never know - how much of his current situation is due to the injury, because we only get a couple of minutes of the backstory.  How far along was he in this downward spiral?  How much of it is, in fact, due to an act of heroism?Soon McDonagh gets put on a quintuple-homicide case that involves drugs, and he's up to his neck both investigating what's going on and trying to make a buck off of it.  Because he's also a gambler you see, and in deep; and he also manages to make an enemy of one of his girlfriend's customers early on who happens to have connections.  More drugs, more threats of violence, and eventually a partnership with one of the dealers...it looks as if McDonagh's days are numbered, and as his life begins to deteriorate, so too his body and mind seem to start falling apart.Then the film starts to change direction, subtly at first and then in the last 20 minutes or so more obviously (which I won't spoil for you), and heads away to some extent from the gritty ""realism"" which seemed to be its focus earlier on.  It's all quite ambivalent and murky in the final analysis, which was probably deliberate but which doesn't entirely work given the single-minded negative direction Cage's character and the film goes in for such a long stretch; if like me you are taking it as a realistic portrait at the beginning, it may be hard to accept the growing fantasy world that it seems to grow into.  And though I don't usually mind being in the company of unpleasant people, in this case it does become a bit wearing, as the film is basically full of nothing but low-lives, from the cops to the dealers and everybody in between.  The film definitely felt a little longer than it needed to be - I think we got both the message (if there is one) and enough incident to keep us entertained by the hour and a half mark; the rest seems a bit repetitious and sometimes silly.But then...there is Cage, who manages the physical and even the vocal mannerisms of someone wearing down day by day through drugs and stress and fear quite effectively.  I'm sure a lot of people are saying this is his best performance in years - not having seen very much of the films he's been making in the past 10-15 years I'll take their word for it, but it's certainly pretty impressive.  I thought his speech pattern, which changes markedly over the course of the film, rather strange - but again, I think that at the end, it's become a different sort of nightmare, a different kind of vision of hell or heaven or...something...and Cage has changed with it.It's also rather odd that nobody in the film sounds particularly like they're from New Orleans - if you look down the cast list, nobody in the top dozen or so credited is from the area, and only a couple are from the south at all.  When you realize this, and when you see where the film goes ultimately, you have to assume that realism was just about the last thing on Herzog's mind.  Sure, the movie was filmed in NOLA and nearby areas, but the seedy atmosphere of the whole thing could be replicated anywhere, and apart from the bookending references to the hurricane, it doesn't much matter.  Which makes the subtitle ""Port of Call New Orleans"" every bit as oblique as the whole film ultimately ends up being.I have the feeling this could easily improve a lot on a subsequent viewing.  Perhaps in this case, having some idea of the direction the film and it's main character are heading in might make it more cohesive and meaningful.  At the moment, in any case, this BAD LIEUTENANT is one of the harder-to-rate films I've seen lately; Cage's performance, and the entertainment value of the film, keep it positive, and that's where it'll likely remain pending another viewing.And you'll just have to see the film yourself to know what my title means!",4,His soul is still dancing,1267747200,"03 5, 2010",2010,5941,"['went', 'not',

A recurrent theme of Herzog's work is the breakdown of social norms under extreme conditions, of war or conflict or survival.  Or you might say he's interested in the ways we manage to maintain a paradoxical commitment to ceremony and convention even in extreme situations where the realities that support them and the ideals they are supposed to sustain have broken down.Cage plays a New Orleans police detective, promoted to Lieutenant after a reluctant act of bravery caused him to be injured on the job in the aftermath of Katrina.  His resultant back pains help explain his addiction to pain pills and other illegal ""medications,"" but it is the paradoxical atmosphere of general permissiveness and tolerance of eccentricity combined with strict regulations that seems to push him over the edge and out of control.  The style of the film likewise alternates between fairly conventional police drama and the over-the-top extreme of drug-addled subjectivity.Break dancing souls, hallucinatory iquanas, grieving alligators.  What do fish dream of, anyhow?  An always intriguing, darkly comic (indeed, often bizarrely hilarious) and strange film.  Must see for fans of Herzog and of visionary cinema that pushes against the boundaries of the conventional and familiar.  I'd say, also, that anyone who lovesBreaking Badis likely to dig the humor and off-kilter vibe of Herzog's Bad Lieutenant.

1288818,AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B002TVQ48A,"N. Durham ""Big Evil""","[1, 2]","A remake of Bad Lieutenant?  Not really no, as Werner Herzog's The Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans is a different sort of film than Abel Ferrara's early 90s Harvey Keitel-starring tale of corruption and redemption.  Nicolas Cage, giving the best performance he's given in years, stars as Terrence McDonagh; a drug-raddled, painkiller-addicted, gambling junkie New Orleans police lieutenant with a prostitute girlfriend (Eva Mendes) and a very bad back.  While investigating the murders of a family of Senegalese immigrants in this post-Katrina landscape, all fingers point to a local drug lord (Xzibit), who may prove to be untouchable.  While Herzog's film may definitely not be for all tastes, the main attraction here is Cage by and far.

His good-cop-gone-bad character fits his screen persona perfectly. Eva Mendes leads a large cast of supporting characters who really make this an unforgettable movie in a genre that has been overdone lately. The Cage character is truly up against ALL odds, from drug dealers and mobsters to his boss, the D.A. and himself. The storyline is interesting and doesn't get lost despite the many detours it takes as Cage sinks further and further into the dark quicksand of his own making. Who will kill him first? Everyone wants to, and are all determined to take their best shot. There is a lot of dark comic relief thrown in to keep the movie-goer on their toes, and off balance, as Cage torques up his badness and shows no one any respect. This is an excellent movie, well-executed and full of unexpected quirkiness.I am at a loss to explain some of the negative reviews, especially those complaining of camera-work, etc. This movie is of no less quality than any other Hollywood movie. Sure, it lacks computer generated critters, exploding death stars and robot killers from the future ---but then this is not Aliens, Star Wars of T2. I will leave it at that, just to be nice. I think most intelligent movie fans will be able to see what is going on with those low reviews and dismiss them for what they are.Explanation of my five stars: I give one star each for Writing, Continuity, Acting, Concept/Plot, and Execution. This movie does them all very well. I do not rate movies based on my likes/dislikes, because that is not -in my opinion- a fair way to rate a movie. For instance, I rated Morning Glory five stars though it was a love story and I am no fan of same. But I considered the elements of the movie that would make it Good or Bad.WRITING: is the story easy-to-follow, believable (even if I must suspend belief there are some that are TOO silly to believe), unpredictable, complex, interesting?CONTINUITY: is the movie constructed in a way that all technical elements, camera work, wardrobe, make-up, location, effects make sense?ACTING: are the actors into the roles or just mouthing lines to earn their paychecks?CONCEPT/PLOT: is this a plausible concept that could happen in real life, OR is it constructed in a way that it is plausible given a required suspension of belief?EXECUTION: did the movie deliver expected emotion response(s), that is, horror, shock, happiness, sadness, hope, etc., depending on the genre and Concept/Plot?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thanks for reading my review.

1288830,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B002TVQ48A,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans (Werner Herzog, 2009)There are a lot of rumors floating around about this movie. If I'm reading between the proper lines, here's the story that seems right to me: Werner Herzog had a script about a crazy cop going on a rampage. It was called Port of Call: New Orleans. The movie's producers had the rights to the name Bad Lieutenant, and were trying to turn Abel Ferrara's masterpiece--which Herzog had never seen (and to my knowledge still hasn't)--and thus insisted on the title having Bad Lieutenant in it somewhere. Herzog's compromise was to simply use both titles, ignore the Abel Ferrara connection altogether, and go ahead and make the movie he wanted to make. Thus, the correct way to approach PoCNO is to ignore the title altogether and go into it with no expectations. And if you do this, you are almost guaranteed one hell of a good time.Plot: Terence McDonagh (Nicolas Cage in the role he was born to play) is a police officer in the city of New Orleans. He is so corrupt that the very word ""corrupt"" has ceased to have meaning, as it relates to Terence McDonagh; he lives in a world of his own. Assigned the case of five murdered illegal Senegalese immigrants in what may have been a drug deal gone wrong, McDonagh finds himself in close with Big Fate (played by rapper Xzibit), a New Orleans crime lord who realizes as much as McDonagh does that a partnership between the two could be mutually beneficial...Plot, here, is secondary; this is a movie about Nic Cage doing massive amounts of drugs, wandering around New Orleans in a haze, encountering criminals and rogue iguanas, and once in a while attempting to do his job (and doing it so ineptly that he can't help but be promoted, as we see in the opening scene). If you're looking for some sort of coherence, you're in the wrong movie; this is an impressionist romp in the same vein as, say, The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser or Even Dwarfs Started Small rather than the kind of movie Herzog has become known for over the years (either the brilliant documentaries or the obsessive, driven fictional films like Invincible or the films he made with Klaus Kinski). It's not meant to be anything more than a hefty dose of fun, and as long as you take it on its own terms, you'll have a blast with it. *** ",4,"""What are these f***in' iguanas doin' on my coffee table?""",1361923200,"02 27, 2013",2013,2305,"['Bad', 'Lieutenant', 'Port', 'Call', 'New', 'Orleans', 'Werner', 'Herzog', '2009', 'are', 'lot', 'rumors', 'floating', 'around', 'movie', ""'m"", 'reading', 'proper', 'lines', 'here', 'story', 'right', 'Werner', 'Herzog', 'had', 'script', 'crazy', 'cop', 'going', 'rampage', 'was', 'called', 'Port', 'Call', 'New', 'Orleans', 'movie', 'producers', 'had', 'rights', 'name', 'Bad', 'Lieutenant', 'were', 'trying', 'turn', 'Abel', 'Ferrara', 'masterpiece', 'Herzog', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'knowledge', 'still', ""n't"", 'thus', 'insisted', 'title', 'having', 'Bad', 'Lieutenant', 'somewhere', 'Herzog', 'compromise', 'was', 'simply', 'use', 'titles', 'ignore', 'Abel', 'Ferrara', 'connection', 'altogether', 'go', 'ahead', 'make', 'movie', 'wanted', 'make', 'Thus', 'correct', 'way', 'approach', 'PoCNO', 'ignore', 'title', 'altogether', 'go', 'expectations', 'do', 'are', 'almost', 'guaranteed', 'one', 'hell', 'good', 'time.Plot', 'Terence', 'McDonagh', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'role', 'was', 'born', 'play', 'police', 'officer', 'city', 'New', 'Orleans', 'so', 'corrupt', 'very', 'word', 'corrupt', 'ceased', 'have', 'meaning', 'Terence', 'McDonagh', 'world', 'own', 'Assigned', 'case', 'five', 'murdered', 'illegal', 'Senegalese', 'immigrants', 'what', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'drug', 'deal', 'gone', 'wrong', 'McDonagh', 'close', 'Big', 'Fate', 'played', 'rapper', 'Xzibit', 'New', 'Orleans', 'crime', 'lord', 'who', 'as', 'much', 'McDonagh', 'partnership', 'two', 'could', 'be', 'mutually', 'beneficial', 'Plot', 'here', 'secondary', 'movie', 'Nic', 'Cage', 'doing', 'massive', 'amounts', 'drugs', 'wandering', 'around', 'New', 'Orleans', 'haze', 'encountering', 'criminals', 'rogue', 'iguanas', 'once', 'while', 'attempting', 'do', 'job', 'doing', 'so', 'ineptly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'promoted', 'see', 'opening', 'scene', ""'re"", 'looking', 'sort', 'coherence', ""'re"", 'wrong', 'movie', 'impressionist', 'romp', 'same', 'vein', 'say', 'Enigma', 'Kaspar', 'Hauser', 'Even', 'Dwarfs', 'Started', 'Small', 'rather', 'kind', 'movie', 'Herzog', 'become', 'known', 'years', 'brilliant', 'documentaries', 'obsessive', 'driven', 'fictional', 'films', 'Invincible', 'films', 'made', 'Klaus', 'Kinski', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'anything', 'more', 'hefty', 'dose', 'fun', 'as', 'long', 'take', 'own', 'terms', ""'ll"", 'have', 'blast', '***']",N/A

Zwick,"[1, 1]","After what seems like decades of poor career choices, Nicholas Cage isfinally back at the top of his game in ""Bad Lieutenant: Port of CallNew Orleans,"" a film that reminds us of just how fine an actor the man can be when hehas material worthy of his talents.In this ""loose"" follow-up to the 1992 film ""Bad Lieutenant,"" Cage playsTerence McDonaugh, a homicide detective whose chronic back pain hasturned him into a veritable coke fiend, and whose penchant for gamblingand consorting with prostitutes makes him less than ideal law enforcermaterial. Yet, despite his moral shortcomings, McDonaugh is a crackinvestigator who's currently working on a case involving the brutalslaying of a heroin dealer and his family of Senegalese immigrants.In its willingness to take its time laying out its storyline andsoaking in the rich details of its social milieu and physical setting,""Bad Lieutenant"" has more in common with dense TV dramas like ""TheShield"" and ""The Wire"" than it does with slicker police proceduralsaimed at a mainstream movie audience. Beyond Cage, who makes us feelevery twinge - physical or otherwise - that the character is goingthrough, there is excellent supporting work from Eva Mendes, Tom Bowerand Jennifer Coolidge, among others, though Val Kilmer isunder-utilized as his crime-fighting partner.Director Werner Herzog adds a number of offbeat ""artistic"" touches -some involving indigenous fauna like alligators and iguanas - toheighten the somewhat surrealistic nature of the piece, whichaccurately reflects McDonaugh's increasingly altered state ofconsciousness. Despite the murder mystery scenario that serves as itsengine, the screenplay by William Finkelstein frequently takes detoursaround the main story, more concerned with exploring character andsetting than with providing a linear, action-packed narrative. And it's also wickedly funny.  In fact, the more emotionally and psychologically unhinged McDonaugh becomesthroughout the course of the story, the more the black humor quotientrises up to meet him.Cage, showing his confidence as an actor, is not afraid to push theenvelope in his performance, often ratcheting it up a notch or two toconvey McDonaugh's disordered state.

1288833,A3O8HCFECC2GT6,B002TVQ48A,Ross,"[1, 3]","I wanted to like this movie more. I am a fan of Eva Mendes, and Nicholas Cage seems to have more unactualized potential of any actor working.The original was a gritty, nonstop brutal and gripping portrayal of the despair of a man who is way too far down the wrong path. The acting is good enough, but the story lacks inspiration and therefore believability. Cage and Mendes are captivating when the writing allows. For example, the scenes where Cage strongarms the john in the hotel room, or the young users in the parking lot, fall flat because Cage and the writers can't put together believable storytelling. Cage shines in scenes where he really lets loose, like in the pharmacy scene or his car ride scene with his new business partners, and exhibits his eccentric force.Xzibit is as good as ever, and Val Kilmer reaffirms that the level of his talent is such that he will shine in any role. Kilmer seems to be like Ray Liotta, in that their apparent drive to work seems to land them in movies that are beneath them, but then again, that's not uncommon - Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken.This movie is little more than a moderately interesting and propagandized indictment of police authority, and unfortunately, the original was much better with a better lead performance and more memorable scenes.",3,falls well short of original,1355184000,"12 11, 2012",2012,1304,"['wanted', 'like', 'movie', 'more', 'am', 'fan', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'have', 'more', 'unactualized', 'potential', 'actor', 'working.The', 'original', 'was', 'gritty', 'nonstop', 'brutal', 'gripping', 'portrayal', 'despair', 'man', 'who', 'way', 'too', 'far', 'down', 'wrong', 'path', 'acting', 'good', 'enough', 'story', 'inspiration', 'therefore', 'believability', 'Cage', 'Mendes', 'are', 'captivating', 'when', 'writing', 'example', 'scenes', 'where', 'Cage', 'john', 'hotel', 'room', 'young', 'users', 'parking', 'lot', 'fall', 'flat', 'Cage', 'writers', 'ca', ""n't"", 'put', 'together', 'believable', 'storytelling', 'Cage', 'shines', 'scenes', 'where', 'really', 'loose', 'pharmacy', 'scene', 'car', 'ride', 'scene', 'new', 'business', 'partners', 'eccentric', 'force.Xzibit', 'as', 'good', 'ever', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'level', 'talent', 'such', 'will', 'shine', 'role', 'Kilmer', 'be', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'apparent', 'drive', 'work', 'land', 'movies', 'are', 'then', 'again', 'not', 'uncommon', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'Christopher', 'Walken.This', 'movie', 'little', 'more', 'moderately', 'interesting', 'propagandized', 'indictment', 'police', 'authority', 'unfortunately', 'original', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'better', 'lead', 'performance', 'more', 'memorable', 'scenes']",N/A

1288841,A38DQCCC64K4W,B002TVQ48A,takethekman,"[106, 121]","I have to say I was somewhat horrified when I saw the trailer for this; it looked very generic and unintersting. The first thought in my head after hearing about this collaboration of Herzog and Cage was 'trainwreck'. I mean, I knew it would be at least an interesting wreck, but I was not expecting much. I was dead wrong.Also, let me say that the original film by Abel Ferrara is one of my all time faves, and Harvey Keitel's performance is the answer I automatically give to anyone who asks what my all time favorite film performance is.That being said.....While the first film is dark and just brutal, this film is actually quite funny. With the exception of drug addict cops and gambling debts, the films are quite different. The first was def more in your face w/both it's graphic portrayal of gutter life and the ever-present religious overtones. This film is far more subtle, both in it's scenery and supporting cast, all across the board I might add; both the locations and characters are there, just waiting to be noticed for their authenticity in even the smallest part. There is reality to them all, much of which can be very comedic. The same can be said for the backdrop of New Orleans; it plays second to the human cast, but there is much to be noticed upon multiple viewings.Nicolas Cage is perfectly cast and pull this one off flawlessly; his energy and humor, crossed w/a few somber and even emotional moments(esp. the scene where he talks about his treasure hunt w/Eva Mendes....). Cage makes every scene enjoyable, which is basically every scene. His acting is consistent throughout, even changing his tone of voice after being up for 3 days(as people who have been packing their noses for 72 hours with no sleep often do.....almost a godfather type thing), with his hunched back and .44 magnum hanging from his belt. This may be Cage's best film, and he deserves so much credit for this performance. I actually had fun watching him, and I never thought of him as Nicolas Cage, despite some obvious 'Cage-isms' here and there in terms of delivery. But you can tell he was into this part, and the result is almost more of a comic tour de force than anything else....he delivers lines like 'don't worry about your clothes right now...this is uncut dope!' with a certain comic timing almost, and like Keitel, you are just waiting to see what he will do next.Some people found this movie boring and linear; while straightforward on the surface(kind of reminded me of an early 70's cop movie at times...), it deepens upon multiple viewings. You can tell Cage and Herzog made some kind of connection, and to be honest I am thankful someone actually funded this and got the talent involved. You can tell there was not a huge budget for this movie, which I think helped in terms of getting unknown/lesser known actors to fill many of the smaller but important roles. It adds a certain authenticity. The result is something truly original, funny, but by no means without it's share of corruption, brutality, and intense moments. Not very violent, but there is def a feeling of something heavy coming throughout, given some of the situations.I would also say there are some surprises in here I have not seen in any film; Herzog has a great control over this film, and from the opening scene in the flooded jailhouse to the final frames, you can see he put his heart into this film. Plus there are 3 things in this movie I have never seen before in any movie; they were surprising and gut busting. You are lucky if you get one good twist in a movie nowadays.This is based on seeing 4 times in the theater, but I can only imagine it will look fantastic on blu ray. An odd film to some, lame to others. But hopefully some will see this for the brilliant movie it is and get past the title or any comparisons. They are both great films to me, and completely different.A great example of what talented people all across the board can do w/basically no money, and outshine most 'funded' movies...Go figure.***UPDATE: Looks amazing on Blu Ray; This is how this movie was meant to be seen.

The film opened my senses to the reality of an ongoing presence of decentralists operating at the highest levels of New Orleans police - which is just what the people of New Orleans need!! Allow me to explain. 10 years ago , it became pretty much obvious to every awakening American that decentralization is a major important answer to the question of what is to be done about corruption in American politics and in the American police forces. In this film , the concept of total decentralization from bottom up is visualized. Several policemen decide to get the New Orleans police clean from corruption in a matter of a bet that will cost one of them thousands of U.S. dollars - merely a few weeks! They decide to rely upon the one policeman they can rely upon (the character played by Nicholas Cage) who understands that to get your area rid of corruption you must be corrupt for a while yourself. As the thin line between what corruption means on a philosophical level and what corruption really isn't is drawn - it becomes clear to the police officer , that decentralization is just as much a philosophical concept as corruption - in ways he would never have suspected. Faced with the possibility of loosing his job if he will not find and aid in the pleading of guilty the parties responsible for the deaths of three children and their mother , he decides to join for a while forces with some of the most corrupt among New Orlean's drug lords , and convinces them that he has no spiritual discernment whatsoever , while his spiritual discernment turns out in the end to be vastly superior to that which he had thought he really possessed. Nicholas Cage performs brilliantly as the uomo sinistrium of modern times - the sinister man who has replaced uomo universalis - the renaissance man.The renaissance man was more or less a liberal centrist , while the uomo sinistrium is first and foremost a decentrist individualist. The result becomes a totally surprising - albeit very happy ending , where it turns out how hard it really is for the main character to get himself rid of drug addiction. All sorts of moral questions as well as amoral ones are asked in the film and it leaves no area untouched for me that was needed to satisfy my senses as a serious viewer of Nicholas Cage movies (my favourite as a kid was Birdy).New Orleans is thus a terrific portrayal of what may happen , contrary to what most conspiracy writers believe today about the New Orleans police , if they decide one day to decentralize their positions from bottoms up. Already , decentralization of police is becoming a major factor of discussion in many areas of today's politics , now that the European Union is beginning to collapse , followed by the IMF. IMF's collapse is absolutely certain - and it may well have very beneficial consequences for today's present decentralists. I am big on decentralization myself and wholeheartedly support full decentralization of New Orlean's police. What makes this film so unique is how seriously it managed to express the meaning of the concept of 'decentralization'without ever needing to even mention the term.",5,A terrific opportunity for decentralists to show their true might!!,1278979200,"07 13, 2010",2010,3325,"['WELCOME', 'TO', 'THE', 'WORLD', 'OF', 'DECENTRISTS', 'summarise', 'simple', 'terms', 'brilliant', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'Just', 'plain', 'brilliant', 'saw', 'two', 'hours', 'almost', 'passed', 'two', 'minutes', 'film', 'opened', 'senses', 'reality', 'ongoing', 'presence', 'decentralists', 'operating', 'highest', 'levels', 'New', 'Orleans', 'police', 'just', 'what', 'people', 'New', 'Orleans', 'need', 'Allow', 'explain', '10', 'years', 'ago', 'became', 'pretty', 'much', 'obvious', 'awakening', 'American', 'decentralization', 'major', 'important', 'answer', 'question', 'what', 'be', 'done', 'corruption', 'American', 'politics', 'American', 'police', 'forces', 'film', 'concept', 'total', 'decentralization', 'bottom', 'up', 'visualized', 'Several', 'policemen', 'decide', 'get', 'New', 'Orleans', 'police', 'clean', 'corruption', 'matter', 'bet', 'will', 'cost', 'one', 'thousands', 'U.S.', 'dollars', 'merely', 'few', 'weeks', 'decide', 'rely', 'one', 'policeman', 'can', 'rely', 'character', 'played', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'who', 'get', 'area', 'rid', 'corruption', 'must', 'be', 'corrupt', 'while', 'thin', 'line', 'what', 'corruption', 'philosophical', 'level', 'what', 'corruption', 'really', ""n't"", 'drawn', 'clear', 'police', 'officer', 'decentralization', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'philosophical', 'concept', 'corruption', 'ways', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'suspected', 'Faced', 'possibility', 'loosing', 'job', 'will', 'not', 'find', 'aid', 'pleading', 'guilty', 'parties', 'responsible', 'deaths', 'three', 'children', 'mother', 'join', 'while', 'forces', 'most', 'corrupt', 'New', 'Orlean', 'drug', 'lords', 'spiritual', 'discernment', 'whatsoever', 'spiritual', 'discernment', 'out', 'end', 'be', 'vastly', 'superior', 'had', 'thought', 'really', 'possessed', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'performs', 'brilliantly', 'uomo', 'sinistrium', 'modern', 'times', 'sinister', 'man', 'who', 'replaced', 'uomo', 'universalis', 'renaissance', 'man.The', 'renaissance', 'man', 'was', 'more', 'less', 'liberal', 'centrist', 'uomo', 'sinistrium', 'first', 'foremost', 'decentrist', 'individualist', 'result', 'totally', 'surprising', 'albeit', 'very', 'happy', 'ending', 'where', 'out', 'how', 'hard', 'really', 'main', 'character', 'get', 'rid', 'drug', 'addiction', 'sorts', 'moral', 'questions', 'as', 'well', 'amoral', 'ones', 'are', 'asked', 'film', 'area', 'untouched', 'was', 'needed', 'satisfy', 'senses', 'serious', 'viewer', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'movies', 'favourite', 'kid', 'was', 'Birdy', '.New', 'Orleans', 'thus', 'terrific', 'portrayal', 'what', 'may', 'happen', 'contrary', 'what', 'most', 'conspiracy', 'writers', 'believe', 'today', 'New', 'Orleans', 'police', 'decide', 'one', 'day', 'decentralize', 'positions', 'bottoms', 'up', 'Already', 'decentralization', 'police', 'becoming', 'major', 'factor', 'discussion', 'many', 'areas', 'today', 'politics', 'now', 'European', 'Union', 'beginning', 'collapse', 'followed', 'IMF', 'IMF', 'collapse', 'absolutely', 'certain', 'may', 'well', 'have', 'very', 'beneficial', 'consequences', 'today', 'present', 'decentralists', 'am', 'big', 'decentralization', 'wholeheartedly', 'support', 'full', 'decentralization', 'New', 'Orlean', 'police', 'What', 'film', 'so', 'unique', 'how', 'seriously', 'managed', 'express', 'meaning', 'concept', ""'decentralization'without"", 'ever', 'needing', 'even', 'mention', 'term']",N/A

Same title & same concept. If no one wants to admit that its okay but its the fans that know the truth. So anyway Nicolas Cage plays the role of a Lieutenant in a grimy post Katrina NOLA. In this film Cage does what he does he does best: acts completely crazy. This is also a very adult themed film full of racy content. If that is your interest you will feel right at home here. Cage is so unpredictable in this film you could probably watch it five times and not be totally sure what he is going to do next. The story is the standard. The action is excellent. It is also completely necessary to mention this film is directed by Werner Herzog. A director whose vision really gives Cage the ability to reach the outer orbits of insanity. Watch with care. Overall Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans brings a little welcomed danger back to the screen. Great appearances by Brad Dourif and Eva Mendes.

1288845,A2YW1TL9ZR3URI,B002TVQ48A,"The Mad Bostonian ""Steve""","[1, 1]","I have to say this is Nicolas Cage's better performances in a while, reminds me of early Cage, that he can actually do a good movie and not Hollywood fluff, plus doesn't hurt when teaming up with an intriguing, genius, masterful story teller, visual director as Herzog.But this Bad Lieutenant is far far different than the gritty, dark, depressing original, played by perfection by Keitel.Cage plays a New Orleans cop Terence McDonagh who is addicted to painkillers, cocaine, just drugs in general, likes to gamble, has a prostitute g/f (Eva Mendes), has  a recovering alcoholic father. He roams New Orleans basically free, wielding badge and gun (.44 magnum that he tucks in his belt)and steals from junkies, or he is taking drugs from the police evidence room. He plays the role on such a fine line where it doesn't seem he is ""over acting"" or being over the top, a perfect performance, as he tries to solve a murder of a family and bring in a suspected drug king pin played by Xzibit. We see McDonagh go through police procedures all while coked up. Unlike Keitel he isn't an amoral cop, he is smart and believe it or not does seem to have some morals somewhere in his soul. McDonagh is a street wise, smart, crooked, junkie cop, he's in his own surreal world.He plays the tormented cop very well, always on edge, off kilter, then has some somber moments, again great acting performance by Cage.Herzog's direction here is great, some will argue basically nothing is happening in this movie, no violence, we watch Cage solving this murder, going from Point A to Point B. Herzog's direction is tight, and the way he lets some scenes linger on a crocodile and the iguanas it was weird, and yet surreal, almost as if we now see what McDonagh is going through while all doped up and working.I felt the original was awesome, a masterful movie but yet so dark, so sad, but unflinching, and depressing, this Bad Lieutenant Port of Call New Orleans didn't leave me with that feeling, it was Cage's performance that hooked me and had me laughing at some of the crazy scenes.

The man is pure intensity and believable in any role. That's why I get so frustrated when he wastes his time on a bad movie like this one. I never saw the first Bad Lieutenant film, but this one was presented as a dark drama, centered around the murder of an immigrant family, but that really wasn't the focus of this film. Port of Call New Orleans focuses on a cop who was injured in the line of duty. As a result of severe pain, he turns to drugs and to using any means necessary to obtain those drugs. If I were the writer of a film like this, I would have made it a comedy and the cop would be completely outrageous and over the top. There were a lot of scenes that could have been made really enjoyable with a little bit of comedy, but they didn't do that. This is a slow moving film, about a mess of a man doing messed up things. There really is no point to the whole thing and it is more than somewhat hard to follow. A good measure of a movie is how long does the film actually feel. Bad Lieutenant was 2 hours, but easily felt like 8. The beginning is kind of interesting, and while I was beyond bored, I had to stick it out to see what happened, I'm sorry I did.

Religious overtone in Abel Ferrara version is mostly removed. The setting is changed from New York to New Orleans and Werner Herzog shoots the city in the most unflattering way. He never misses a chance to show the contrast between the haves and the have-nots, and he does it blatantly. It often looks as if the ""Fitzcarraldo"" director follows where his instinct leads.

1288852,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B002TVQ48A,Turfseer,"[4, 7]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***The Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call - New Orleans is the updated version of the original Bad Lieutenant, starring Harvey Keitel, which debuted in 1992. This one is directed by German Director Werner Herzog, well known in the 70s and 80s for such classics as Aguirre - The Wrath of God. Where the original Bad Lieutenant was a grim, unpleasant little film which attempted to emulate the early Martin Scorsese (featuring an unlikeable protagonist in the title role), Herzog opts to play his Bad Lieutenant for laughs. As a result, while not a particularly noteworthy film, the new incarnation is vastly more entertaining than the original.Despite the outrageous, over-the-top performance, Nicolas Cage's Bad Lieutenant is far more likable than Keitel's surly cop. Yes, they both have terrible drug habits but Cage's Terence McDonagh has traits the audience can identify with: devotion to a woman (albeit his prostitute girlfriend), love of animals (he attempts to find a new home for his father's dog), respect for a parent (he always shows concern for his father and tries to help him) and commitment to finishing a job (despite being sidetracked, McDonagh eventually does catch the murderer).In the 1992 version, we cringe when Keitel's Bad Lieutenant rips off an innocent store owner after menacing a couple of punks. But when McDonagh steps over the line, his victims are not completely innocent. Thus Herzog manages to mitigate the Bad Lieutenant's cruelty. For example, when McDonagh frisks the young couple who have just come out of the club and tries to extort them, the young man IS guilty of drug possession (and his female victim isn't scared of being victimized; she willingly participates in having sex with McDonagh). Later, when McDonagh rips the breathing tube from the elderly woman, his 'cowboy' tactics aren't completely vile since he is attempting to extract information on the whereabouts of a teenage murder witness from the boy's grandmother who at first refuses to cooperate.Another advantage the new version has over the old, is that 'Port of Call' actually has something of a plot. When we first meet the Bad Lieutenant, he's saving a prisoner from drowning inside a New Orleans jail cell as the Katrina flood waters rise. While McDonagh acts out of complete self-interest (it leads to his promotion), the act of saving the prisoner is McDonagh's 'save the cat' moment (the necessary moment during the first five pages of a screenplay, in which the late screen writing guru, Blake Snyder, holds that the protagonist must do something positive for the audience to like him for the rest of the film).'Port of Call' proceeds smartly during the first half of the second act as McDonagh is hot on the trail of the man who murdered five Sengalese family members in a run down section of New Orleans. There are a few good scenes where two suspects are brought in and interrogated and later when McDonagh, who has been protecting the only witness to the killings, a fifteen year old boy, loses him after he goes off to snort some drugs for a few minutes (the boy flees to England and the case against the prime suspect, Big Fate, a local drug dealer, collapses.) In the second half of act two, the plot becomes much more convoluted. McDonagh threatens one of his girlfriend's customers, a son of a well-connected developer, who has ties to the mob. The mobsters get wind of McDonagh's boorish behavior and patronize his prostitute girlfriend. When McDonagh walks in on them, instead of paying the $10,000 fee for the girlfriend's services , they demand $50,000 as payback for the humiliation the Bad Lieutenant inflicted on the developer's son. To make matters worse, McDonagh's owes thousands to his bookie after losing numerous bets on college football games. McDonagh seeks out a star player on a local football team and threatens to arrest him for marijuana possession unless he agrees to throw the game so the Bad Lieutenant can cover the point spread.'Port of Call', which in the first half of the movie, appeared to be developing into a smart police procedural, opts for the easy denouement. McDonagh is stripped of his gun after complaints from the breathing tube lady and the developer's son bring out the police public integrity squad (in the original Bad Lieutenant, Harvey Keitel is never subject to the scrutiny of internal affairs). McDonagh contacts Big Fate and somehow convinces him to pay him the $15,000 he owes to his bookie in exchange for providing tips as to when the police might be impinging on the drug dealer's territory. In the most ludicrous scene in the film, the mobsters somehow march into Big Fate's house and they are conveniently dispatched by Big Fate and his bodyguards as McDonagh watches on, in a drug induced stupor (during this scene, McDonagh orders Big Fate to shoot the chief mobster again since his 'soul is still dancing'; out of the blue, we actually see the 'soul dancer' dancing before the mobster is finished off--undoubtedly a figment of McDonagh's drug-addled imagination).Through a stroke of great luck, McDonagh still manges to cover the point spread even though the football player he extorted, sits on the sidelines. True to form, McDonagh plants a crack pipe with Big Fate's DNA on it at the murder scene, and the murderer is brought to justice.You'll never see Nicholas Cage looking as bad as he does here in this film. It's intentional however, since everything is supposed to be completely over the top. Herzog scores no points for allowing boom microphones to unintentionally appear during the filming of various scenes (I counted at least six, possible seven instances of this occurring). Bad Lieutenant is fairly entertaining but is often silly to the point where it's impossible to take it seriously. I will not give away the bit about the Iguana; you have to see that for yourself!",3,"The Good, The Bad, and the Iguana",1265760000,"02 10, 2010",2010,5899,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain',
