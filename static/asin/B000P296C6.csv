1068180,A3I7OX03X6KDMN,B000P296C6,"Chris Roberts ""Chris Roberts""","[5, 16]","In the new season of ""Extras"" Andy (Ricky Gervais) takes the next logical step in his quest for superstardom. No longer slumming with those other extras he has joined the cast of a new sitcom. The main theme of this season is the role of selling out in the name of career advancement. Andy seems to think the show is crap (as do the critics and most anybody he run into on the street) so to even be on the show (which involves him wearing a silly wig and glasses) is a sacrifice of his principles. He learns that when you are at the bottom all of your anger is directed upwards and unquestionably justified, but when you climb up that ladder you are suddenly a target of somebody else's anger. Hobos want extra big handouts, moms want you to visit their sick kid, and ""victims"" of your abuse want you to make a donation to their favorite charity. . .it's never ending really. I found all this kind of funny because for my money Gervais has one of the least compromised careers out there. Well yes, he did take that ""Night at the Museum"" gig, but even there he tried to bring soul to that failure. . .and failed, but I forgive him.As the season wears on it becomes quite apparent that Andy isn't cut out for this whole celebrity thing. He is far too susceptible to emotional outbursts which lead to him being placed in some fairly embarrassing situations. To make matters worse his sidekick Maggie and agent Darren only work to make his life a little more difficult. Yet despite this his star continues to rise. He sticks to his catchphrase, even when out of character, and plays to his base. And I'm sure that whole incident where he beat up a midget didn't hurt matters either. Of course this being HBO the whole show exists pretty much as an excuse to spit on the idea of celebrity. This along with ""The Comeback"" and ""Entourage"" has created a little subgenre where the viewer is invited to pretend that they are also a part of the entertainment industry. Of course the joke at the core of all of these shows is that in reality the entertainment industry is really a nasty, vile place where no sane person would choose to hang out.This season improves upon the last but the show remains good not great. The lines got funnier, the cringe factor was turned up and Gervais even throws in some physical humor for us. There are guest stars in every episode playing themselves but the one that struck closest to gold was Daniel Radcliffe playing a sexually warped wannabe gigolo who tries to bed Maggie. Since Radcliffe is really only known as Harry Potter the joke works quite well. The whole season feels unfair to poor Andy. He wants to approach the sitcom in a dignified manner but those suits at the BBC stick their noses in and practically force him to sell out. That left him with the choice of being an extra or being a laughing stock, he chose the latter and I think the show is better because of it.",3,I Had a Decent Laugh,1183507200,"07 4, 2007",2007,2905,"['new', 'season', 'Extras', 'Andy', 'Ricky', 'Gervais', 'next', 'logical', 'step', 'quest', 'superstardom', 'No', 'longer', 'slumming', 'other', 'extras', 'joined', 'cast', 'new', 'sitcom', 'main', 'theme', 'season', 'role', 'selling', 'out', 'name', 'career', 'advancement', 'Andy', 'think', 'show', 'crap', 'do', 'critics', 'most', 'anybody', 'street', 'so', 'even', 'be', 'show', 'wearing', 'silly', 'wig', 'glasses', 'sacrifice', 'principles', 'when', 'are', 'bottom', 'anger', 'directed', 'upwards', 'unquestionably', 'justified', 'when', 'climb', 'up', 'ladder', 'are', 'suddenly', 'target', 'somebody', 'else', 'anger', 'Hobos', 'want', 'extra', 'big', 'handouts', 'moms', 'want', 'visit', 'sick', 'kid', 'victims', 'abuse', 'want', 'make', 'donation', 'favorite', 'charity', '.it', 'never', 'ending', 'really', 'found', 'kind', 'funny', 'money', 'Gervais', 'one', 'least', 'compromised', 'careers', 'out', 'there', 'Well', 'yes', 'did', 'take', 'Night', 'Museum', 'gig', 'even', 'tried', 'bring', 'soul', 'failure', '.and', 'failed', 'forgive', 'season', 'quite', 'apparent', 'Andy', ""n't"", 'cut', 'out', 'whole', 'celebrity', 'thing', 'far', 'too', 'susceptible', 'emotional', 'outbursts', 'lead', 'being', 'placed', 'fairly', 'embarrassing', 'situations', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'sidekick', 'Maggie', 'agent', 'Darren', 'only', 'work', 'make', 'life', 'little', 'more', 'difficult', 'star', 'rise', 'catchphrase', 'even', 'when', 'character', 'base', ""'m"", 'sure', 'whole', 'incident', 'where', 'beat', 'up', 'midget', 'did', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'matters', 'course', 'being', 'HBO', 'whole', 'show', 'pretty', 'much', 'excuse', 'spit', 'idea', 'celebrity', 'Comeback', 'Entourage', 'created', 'little', 'subgenre', 'where', 'viewer', 'invited', 'pretend', 'are', 'also', 'part', 'entertainment', 'industry', 'course', 'joke', 'core', 'shows', 'reality', 'entertainment', 'industry', 'really', 'nasty', 'vile', 'place', 'where', 'sane', 'person', 'would', 'choose', 'hang', 'out.This', 'season', 'last', 'show', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'lines', 'got', 'funnier', 'cringe', 'factor', 'was', 'turned', 'up', 'Gervais', 'even', 'physical', 'humor', 'are', 'guest', 'stars', 'episode', 'playing', 'one', 'struck', 'closest', 'gold', 'was', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'playing', 'sexually', 'warped', 'wannabe', 'gigolo', 'who', 'bed', 'Maggie', 'Radcliffe', 'really', 'only', 'known', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'joke', 'quite', 'well', 'whole', 'season', 'feels', 'unfair', 'poor', 'Andy', 'approach', 'sitcom', 'dignified', 'manner', 'suits', 'BBC', 'stick', 'noses', 'practically', 'force', 'sell', 'out', 'left', 'choice', 'being', 'extra', 'being', 'laughing', 'stock', 'chose', 'latter', 'think', 'show', 'better']",Extras: Season 2

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[31, 34]","Ricky Gervais actually managed to top himself with season one of ""Extras,"" all about a struggling actor trying to catch a break.Well, in the second season of ""Extras,"" his character has finally gotten one. But obviously it's not smooth sailing for the stressed-out extras, who continue to stumble through odd jobs and exaggerated celebrities. It's full of hilarious spoofery of the entertainment biz, and is pretty much hysterical from start to finish.In the opening episode, Andy (Gervais) has finally gotten his own sitcom, ""When the Whistle Blows,"" and is over the moon. Problem is, the BBC decides to dumb it down and make him use funny costuming to achieve cheap laughs. As the season goes on, Andy struggles to keep ""When the Whistle Blows"" afloat and approved of, since the reviews are atrocious.Meanwhile, Maggie (Ashley Jensen) has a tiny part in an absurd courtroom drama starring Orlando Bloom, and the arrogant Bloom starts pursuing her when she expresses a lack of interest.  (""They're basically just doing it because you're famous."" ""Well, they're not just doing it because I'm famous -- no, it's my looks as well!""). When he's not making fun of Johnny Depp (""I've got scissors for hands!"")He and Maggie continue to tangle with a bunch of other celebs -- a sex-obsessed Daniel Radcliffe (who accidentally snaps a condom at Diana Rigg), Warwick Davis, a self-promoting Chris Martin, and Robert De Niro. He also gets mocked by David Bowie in a pub, and his sitcom is criticized by Stephen Fry. He even stars in a play directed by Ian McKellen, but neglects to notice that it's a gay romance with a man-man kiss.It's sort of pleasant that Gervais didn't pound the ""barely employed actor"" thing to death after the first season of ""Extras."" Instead, he uses Andy's sitcom to open new storylines (and new disasters) for his increasingly embittered character, as he tries to straddle the fence between success and being a genuine actor.Gervais continues to write wonderfully squirmy dialogue (""'TV bully kicks dwarf in face.'"" ""Accurate, but as you say there's no such thing as bad publicity"") and horribly embarrassing situations. It's all filmed in a very natural style, except that now we have some looks inside Andy's sitcom, a sort of lowbrow, widely-watched comedy with a random celeb cameo.Poor Andy has a rough time in this season, and so Gervais really brings out his frustration and dissatisfaction with the way his poor show has been mutilated. Not to mention his tendency to embarrass himself. And Jensen is wonderful as the sweet, flaky Maggue, while Stephen Merchant is great fun as Andy's inept agent.But the best is the stuff uttered by the actors -- Radcliffe and Bloom are hysterical as clumsily woman-chasing, self-obsessed parodies of themselves, and it's hard not to adore them for it. Bowie's ""pathetic little fat man/nobody's laughing"" song is just hilarious. And McKellen steals the show, whether it's discussing his ""method"" (""How did I know what to say? They had my lines written down on a SCRIPT"") or accidentally making it look like he and Andy had an intimate encounter.""Extras: Season Two"" is a solid follow-up to the outstanding first season, with our ""extras"" continuing to struggle in the surreal world of showbiz.

Hooray, we win!  Season 2 of ""Extras"" is even funnier than season 1. Andy Millman has achieved some sort of fame with his new sitcom, but he's not happy.  Meanwhile, his agent still doesn't have a clue, his best friend Maggie still struggles as an extra and Britain's (and some of America's) best and brightest make clever cameos.The fact that Ashley Jensen as Maggie did not get an Emmy nomination for her work on this show is criminal.  Maggie is a brilliant comic creation and Jensen makes her ditzy but incredibly lovable.  The blank look and muttered ""Hmm?"" Maggie gives when she realizes she's in trouble is classic.  Stephen Merchant is incredibly funny as the lackluster agent and lights up the screen whenever he's on.  You'll never forget his scene with a wire whisk.And then there's Gervais who this time out plays a much more sympathetic character than David Brent.  Andy is even the straight man at times, though there are the usual Gervais-esque slip ups.One of the best things about ""Extras"" is that it doesn't seem to have the type of formula ""The Office"" did and therefore, we won't have an American remake.

Gervais, Jensen and Merchant played engaging, though vaguely believable characters, and I did have a few laugh-out-loud moments.

Orlando Bloom: It was okay. If you like Bloom you will enjoy it.

1068191,AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B000P296C6,"N. Durham ""Big Evil""","[17, 18]","As the second season of Extras opens, it appears as if things may be looking up for struggling actor Andy Millman (Ricky Gervais).  His sitcom, ""When the Whistle Blows"", is picked up by BBC with himself in a lead role.  Problem is, BBC makes him water the show down so much that despite it's high ratings, it gets slaughtered in the review columns.  The season mainly focuses on Andy's troubles with the show becoming a hit (including a hilarious satire on the paparazzi), while Maggie (Ashley Jensen) goes about her same routine of looking her love, and Andy's agent (Stephen Merchant) proves to be inept as ever, leading up to a decision from Andy in regards to their professional relationship.  Like the first season, the second season of Extras has it's fair share of A-list guest stars that all leave their mark.  Robert DeNiro, Orlando Bloom, Ian McKellan, Coldplay's Chris Martin, Stephen Fry, and Warwick ""Leprechaun"" Davis all make the most of their time, but it's David Bowie and Harry Potter himself Daniel Radcliffe that will leave you in absolute hysterical joy.  All in all, the second (and possibly final) season of Extras is another excellent comedic blast to come from Ricky Gervais, and if you've never seen this show, you have been sadly missing out.",5,"""Are you havin' a laugh?""",1177286400,"04 23, 2007",2007,1269,"['second', 'season', 'Extras', 'things', 'may', 'be', 'looking', 'up', 'struggling', 'actor', 'Andy', 'Millman', 'Ricky', 'Gervais', 'sitcom', 'When', 'Whistle', 'Blows', 'picked', 'up', 'BBC', 'lead', 'role', 'Problem', 'BBC', 'water', 'show', 'down', 'so', 'much', 'high', 'ratings', 'slaughtered', 'review', 'columns', 'season', 'mainly', 'Andy', 'troubles', 'show', 'becoming', 'hit', 'including', 'hilarious', 'satire', 'paparazzi', 'Maggie', 'Ashley', 'Jensen', 'same', 'routine', 'looking', 'love', 'Andy', 'agent', 'Stephen', 'Merchant', 'be', 'inept', 'ever', 'leading', 'up', 'decision', 'Andy', 'regards', 'professional', 'relationship', 'first', 'season', 'second', 'season', 'Extras', 'fair', 'share', 'A-list', 'guest', 'stars', 'leave', 'mark', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'Ian', 'McKellan', 'Coldplay', 'Chris', 'Martin', 'Stephen', 'Fry', 'Warwick', 'Leprechaun', 'Davis', 'make', 'most', 'time', 'David', 'Bowie', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'will', 'leave', 'absolute', 'hysterical', 'joy', 'second', 'possibly', 'final', 'season', 'Extras', 'excellent', 'comedic', 'blast', 'come', 'Ricky', 'Gervais', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'show', 'have', 'been', 'sadly', 'missing', 'out']",Extras: Season 2

It's amazing to me how Ricky Gervais's brilliance seems to be somewhat overlooked in the US, but then again, not everyone can appreciate his brand of distinctly British humor.  The cameos in Series 2 are as enjoyable as the first series.  I personally found Orlando Bloom, David Bowie, and (surprisingly) Chris Martin to be particularly amusing.  The bit with Chris Martin after his episode's credits left my sides hurting with laugher.Extras Series 2 exceeds in engaging the viewer in Andy's struggles.  It often achieves a real emotional poignancy and relatability which can be uncommon for comedies.  The supporting cast, including Stephen Merchant and the amazing Ashley Jensen.  And Shaun Williamson (as Barry) lends the series some of its best laughs with his scenes with Merchant.For fans of Extras, you probably already own this.  For anyone curious and looking for something new and refreshing, check this out, but make sure you grab up the first series while you're at it.And if you haven't already (and shame on you ;), watch the original The Office by Ricky Gervais.",5,Ricky Gervais's brilliance continues.,1186099200,"08 3, 2007",2007,1171,"['Series', '2', 'brings', 'Extras', 'darned', 'near', 'close', 'heights', 'achieved', 'classic', 'Office', 'amazing', 'how', 'Ricky', 'Gervais', 'brilliance', 'be', 'somewhat', 'overlooked', 'US', 'then', 'again', 'not', 'everyone', 'can', 'appreciate', 'brand', 'distinctly', 'British', 'humor', 'cameos', 'Series', '2', 'are', 'as', 'enjoyable', 'first', 'series', 'personally', 'found', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'David', 'Bowie', 'surprisingly', 'Chris', 'Martin', 'be', 'particularly', 'amusing', 'bit', 'Chris', 'Martin', 'episode', 'credits', 'left', 'sides', 'hurting', 'laugher.Extras', 'Series', '2', 'exceeds', 'engaging', 'viewer', 'Andy', 'struggles', 'often', 'real', 'emotional', 'poignancy', 'relatability', 'can', 'be', 'uncommon', 'comedies', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'Stephen', 'Merchant', 'amazing', 'Ashley', 'Jensen', 'Shaun', 'Williamson', 'Barry', 'series', 'best', 'laughs', 'scenes', 'Merchant.For', 'fans', 'Extras', 'probably', 'already', 'own', 'anyone', 'curious', 'looking', 'something', 'new', 'refreshing', 'check', 'out', 'make', 'sure', 'grab', 'up', 'first', 'series', ""'re"", 'it.And', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'shame', 'watch', 'original', 'Office', 'Ricky', 'Gervais']",Extras: Season 2
