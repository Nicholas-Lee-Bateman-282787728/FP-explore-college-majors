326338,A2YH3YTPSCAWF9,6302658799,"Anthony Marinelli ""marilread""","[1, 2]","Its great to see two big stars together in a movie although they dont always when together make the best of films,but in this case that's not the case. These types of sex farces at which the 60's was famous,many of which are not very good,in this case it is quite good. Tony curtis became famous for a series of dramatic films in the 50's becoming a hearthrob of sorts to many woman,Houdini about the magician is still entertaining as well as Some like it hot with marilyn monroe. Then in the 60's he decided to concentrate on a series of sex farce type films from the male's perspective which are not always viewed that well today. This is the exception. Jerry lewis started out nightclubbing with dean martin and then taking their routine to movies however the movieswere produced and written to portray his various talents,especially the directing. He eventually split from Martin and went solo. For many years he made solo productions(producer-director-writer) as well as films with mentor frank tashlin,who also directed some of bob hope's best films. He was always with Paramount studios,and this 1965 production is the last film he made with the studio. More on that later. The film works based on a good play,which always helps and Lewis is not used to,nor the adult theme and perhaps theadult fare and costarring with Curtis appealed to him. The dialogue is good it is well directed not degenerating into physicalness or exhibitionism,and remains at the dialogue level. The dialogue is crisp,fresh,whimsical andentertaining and keeps you interested. The film is told from the male perspective and the females are not that bright,but it is told from themales point of view,its that kind of film. The film is a Curtis vehicle,and a european type play about americansd in paris keeping a rotating group of stewerdesses at his apartment,keeping each in the dark,as the curtis sais a'polygamous' romp,but he admits this is a day when marriage is not working. As the Lewis character sais where are the morals today. This is the basis of the movie and thelma Ritter adds much to the film,and is delightful,adding much to a film which good character actresses always do,she steals all her scenes and maybe because she's the female more fleshed out. Lewis seems quite restrainedand the slapstick fairly gone and is low key. The film was a box office flop and i dont know if it was the european setting or what..Lewis next wanted tomake three on a couch(1966)which he made at columbia about a similar typeof person this time with a psychiatrist along but paramount refused andcolumbia took him up and he worked there for a few years. That film was popular with audiences but lambasted with critics. Curtis really ruined his career by making these sexual type farces comedies too often,,Lewis understood thechanging nature of american cinema. At this time it was changing and his audience could no longer be relied on so he changed to a more mature audience and theme but it never really caught on. He saw himself as a filmmaker like chaplin a total filmmaker,but had little critical acceptance in america, morewell thought of in europe by some in high esteem. He is  a different filmmaker and original,and the Tashlin directed movies are quite different than whenhe's in control...which are better? Of course every movies different but some of the films where he plays several disguises you seldom see done today,and children and adults could easily enjoy fare like the Family Jewells(1965)...he's also quite a good standup comedian and was a headliner at nightclubs for much of his career although on variety programs never found hisniche.",4,the best of its kind!!,1333411200,"04 3, 2012",2012,3639,"['great', 'see', 'two', 'big', 'stars', 'together', 'movie', 'dont', 'always', 'when', 'together', 'make', 'best', 'films', 'case', 'not', 'case', 'types', 'sex', 'farces', '60', 'was', 'famous', 'many', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'case', 'quite', 'good', 'Tony', 'curtis', 'became', 'famous', 'series', 'dramatic', 'films', '50', 'becoming', 'hearthrob', 'sorts', 'many', 'woman', 'Houdini', 'magician', 'still', 'entertaining', 'as', 'well', 'hot', 'marilyn', 'monroe', 'Then', '60', 'decided', 'concentrate', 'series', 'sex', 'farce', 'type', 'films', 'male', 'perspective', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'viewed', 'well', 'today', 'exception', 'Jerry', 'lewis', 'started', 'out', 'nightclubbing', 'dean', 'martin', 'then', 'taking', 'routine', 'movies', 'however', 'movieswere', 'produced', 'written', 'portray', 'various', 'talents', 'especially', 'directing', 'eventually', 'split', 'Martin', 'went', 'solo', 'many', 'years', 'made', 'solo', 'productions', 'producer-director-writer', 'as', 'well', 'films', 'mentor', 'frank', 'tashlin', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'bob', 'hope', 'best', 'films', 'was', 'always', 'Paramount', 'studios', '1965', 'production', 'last', 'film', 'made', 'studio', 'More', 'later', 'film', 'works', 'based', 'good', 'play', 'always', 'Lewis', 'not', 'used', 'adult', 'theme', 'perhaps', 'theadult', 'fare', 'costarring', 'Curtis', 'appealed', 'dialogue', 'good', 'well', 'directed', 'not', 'degenerating', 'physicalness', 'exhibitionism', 'dialogue', 'level', 'dialogue', 'crisp', 'fresh', 'whimsical', 'andentertaining', 'interested', 'film', 'told', 'male', 'perspective', 'females', 'are', 'not', 'bright', 'told', 'themales', 'point', 'view', 'kind', 'film', 'film', 'Curtis', 'vehicle', 'european', 'type', 'play', 'americansd', 'paris', 'keeping', 'rotating', 'group', 'stewerdesses', 'apartment', 'keeping', 'dark', 'curtis', 'sais', ""a'polygamous"", 'romp', 'day', 'when', 'marriage', 'not', 'working', 'Lewis', 'character', 'sais', 'where', 'are', 'morals', 'today', 'basis', 'movie', 'thelma', 'Ritter', 'much', 'film', 'delightful', 'adding', 'much', 'film', 'good', 'character', 'actresses', 'always', 'do', 'scenes', 'maybe', 'female', 'more', 'fleshed', 'out', 'Lewis', 'quite', 'restrainedand', 'slapstick', 'fairly', 'gone', 'low', 'key', 'film', 'was', 'box', 'office', 'flop', 'i', 'dont', 'know', 'was', 'european', 'setting', 'what..Lewis', 'next', 'wanted', 'tomake', 'three', 'couch', '1966', 'made', 'columbia', 'similar', 'typeof', 'person', 'time', 'psychiatrist', 'paramount', 'refused', 'andcolumbia', 'took', 'up', 'worked', 'few', 'years', 'film', 'was', 'popular', 'audiences', 'lambasted', 'critics', 'Curtis', 'really', 'ruined', 'career', 'making', 'sexual', 'type', 'farces', 'comedies', 'too', 'often', ',Lewis', 'understood', 'thechanging', 'nature', 'american', 'cinema', 'time', 'was', 'changing', 'audience', 'could', 'no', 'longer', 'be', 'relied', 'changed', 'more', 'mature', 'audience', 'theme', 'never', 'really', 'caught', 'saw', 'filmmaker', 'chaplin', 'total', 'filmmaker', 'had', 'little', 'critical', 'acceptance', 'america', 'morewell', 'thought', 'europe', 'high', 'esteem', 'different', 'filmmaker', 'original', 'Tashlin', 'directed', 'movies', 'are', 'quite', 'different', 'whenhe', 'control', 'are', 'better', 'course', 'movies', 'different', 'films', 'where', 'several', 'disguises', 'seldom', 'see', 'done', 'today', 'children', 'adults', 'could', 'easily', 'enjoy', 'fare', 'Family', 'Jewells', '1965', 'also', 'quite', 'good', 'standup', 'comedian', 'was', 'headliner', 'nightclubs', 'much', 'career', 'variety', 'programs', 'never', 'found', 'hisniche']",N/A

Harris ""Film aficionado""","[32, 33]","Those who have eagerly awaited some of Jerry Lewis' post-Dean Martin classics being released on DVD and Blu-ray for the first time will have a special Valentine courtesy of Olive Films as 1958's ""The Geisha Boy,"" 1958's ""Rock-a-Bye Baby"" and 1965's ""Boeing Boeing"" get a 2/14/12 release.  It's hard to imagine that these films have not been made available on DVD prior to now!  Of course, Lewis still remains a love it or loathe it proposition for many modern era film goers--but there is no denying his legacy and impact on the contemporary comedy scene.  Oftentimes content to play the fool, Lewis displayed an innocent appeal on-screen that engaged a sense of silliness in us all.  But he had genuine heart too, and his good-natured screen persona created some indelibly beloved characters that stand in contrast to his more complicated personal life.  These films are an interesting cross section of Lewis' film catalogue as we see him doing what he does best but bringing additional elements of seriousness to the table.  Made of a certain time and place, these films offer great nostalgia value for those that love Lewis--but also an opportunity for new viewers to discover Lewis in his prime.""Boeing Boeing"" is a real product of its time (despite its 2008 all-star Broadway revival).  Originally penned as a French farce by Marc Camoletti, this play was first adapted for an English language audience in 1962.  It must have seemed like a great idea to bring this broad comedy to the big screen, and its frantic energy is infectious and also a bit tiring.  Tony Curtis is the actual lead who is juggling three live-in fiances.  Seem impossible?  Not when all three are stewardesses for rival international airlines whose schedules never intersect.  But that's all about to change as advances in aviation have created faster jets which upsets Curtis' precise scheduling.  In one harried evening, all three ladies will overlap with Curtis, his put-upon housekeeper (always great to see Thelma Ritter), and Jerry Lewis as Curtis' friend/nemesis who wants in on the action.  It's non-stop mayhem with near misses and constant scheming.  It's all so chaste and silly and perfectly exemplifies the swinging sixties mentality with an undercurrent of sexism as the women are little more than a prize for Curtis' womanizing philanderer.But given all that, it can still be a bit of wacky fun.  Curtis has rarely had such a physically demanding role--he's always on the go.  In a change of pace, Lewis is actually more of the straight guy in the comic piece.  Funny and adult, without his usual cartoonish mannerisms, this actually netted Lewis his only Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor in a Comedy.  The actresses all imbue their cultural stereotypes with enthusiasm (one is British, one French, one German) and Ritter can do no wrong.  I think it's fascinating that Lewis turns in one of his most understated roles in this completely over-the-top scenario!  But it is Curtis, and his constant scrambling, that I always remember.  It's fun and funny, as long as you can just accept the premise at face value.  I always describe this one to people as an extended version of Three's Company with Curtis perfecting the role of Jack Tripper.  Not deep, but energetic and amusing, it's a comedy that succeeds because everyone is fully committed to the silliness.
