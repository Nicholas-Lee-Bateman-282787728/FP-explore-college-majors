1691438,ADEVBXUS0RSIR,B00HQJ847Y,"Alain B. Burrese ""Author, Speaker, Mediator, ...","[2, 2]","&#8220;Joint Locks: Learn To Improvise Joint Locks Under Pressure&#8221; with Rory Miller starts out with a scene of him training with a partner and tickling him, and then he goes into his introduction while wearing a shirt that says, &#8220;Ask Me About My Bruises.&#8221; Both of these illustrate that Rory likes to have a little fun with his training. I'm friends with Rory, and he does like to have fun, but he also really knows his stuff and teaches some complex concepts in simple terms. If you can't sit around talking with him and train one-on-one, the next best thing is to attend one of his seminars, and if you can't manage that, buy his DVDs and books and learn from those. I've learned from him in all of these ways.During this introduction, Rory shares some important principles that apply to joint locks. Principles such as maximizing your leverage, two way action, use gravity, basing, stacking, and gifts. He doesn't take long to explain this principles, but they are important to remember to make the other things work.Rory then explains the three types of joints: hing joints, ball & socket joints, and gliding joints. From there, he has a group of students improvising and playing with the concepts he provided to lock joints. He doesn't teach specific locks, but rather the concept of locking, allowing the students to come up with different locks for each joint type. It is apparent watching the DVD that some of the students have more experience with locking joints than others. As the students go through the different type of locks, Miller stops and shares tips and concepts along the way. Principles are illustrated on arms and legs. (Miller also mentions that gliding joint locks work on the neck if lethal force is justified.)When the students are performing locks, the inexperienced viewer might not learn as much, but do watch what they are doing, and be sure to listen to all the little things Rory says as he shows things. But more importantly, try stuff out with your training partner as you both watch the DVD. (This program is filmed during a live class, so it is like you are attending the class, rather than Miller instructing right to the camera as many martial art DVD programs are presented. Some will like the &#8220;live&#8221; feeling, and others may prefer the more traditional teaching to the camera approach.) I wouldn't get too hung up on this, but just learn as much as you can from all of your resources, regardless the format.The program also includes some drills and counters to different locks. Performing these drills allow you to recognize opportunities or &#8220;gifts.&#8221; Miller wants you to be able to see where you can apply a lock, and then know the basic principles to put one on. For those of us who know many locking techniques, this training is still valuable to be able to recognize different situations to use locks than maybe you were taught. Miller wants you to improvise under pressure, and these drills will help you do just that. Even if you do train traditionally with joint locks, you should incorporate Miller's drills to help you develop the feel for putting on locks under pressure and from different positions. It's a short program, only about an hour, but it contains some important instruction. Get with your training partner, watch it together, and then get on the mat and experiment and play around with the drills and material presented here.My first video with Paladin Press was on joint locks, and since then I've done a five volume set on joint locks with Aiki Productions. I share this because even though I know and teach joint locking principles and techniques, I still found a lot of value in this &#8220;Joint Locks&#8221; DVD by Rory Miller. (I will admit that some of the stuff in this DVD I discussed with him in person before seeing the DVD.) I have no reservations in recommending &#8220;Joint Locks: Learn To Improvise Joint Locks Under Pressure&#8221; with Rory Miller to anyone who wants to better understand locks and take their training to another level.",5,Good addition to your training resource library,1403136000,"06 19, 2014",2014,4057,"['8220', 'Joint', 'Locks', 'Learn', 'Improvise', 'Joint', 'Locks', 'Pressure', '8221', 'Rory', 'Miller', 'out', 'scene', 'training', 'partner', 'tickling', 'then', 'introduction', 'wearing', 'shirt', '8220', 'Ask', 'Me', 'My', 'Bruises.', '8221', 'illustrate', 'Rory', 'have', 'little', 'fun', 'training', ""'m"", 'friends', 'Rory', 'have', 'fun', 'also', 'really', 'stuff', 'complex', 'concepts', 'simple', 'terms', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sit', 'around', 'talking', 'train', 'one-on-one', 'next', 'best', 'thing', 'attend', 'one', 'seminars', 'ca', ""n't"", 'manage', 'buy', 'DVDs', 'books', 'learn', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'ways.During', 'introduction', 'Rory', 'shares', 'important', 'principles', 'apply', 'joint', 'locks', 'Principles', 'such', 'maximizing', 'leverage', 'two', 'way', 'action', 'use', 'gravity', 'basing', 'stacking', 'gifts', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'explain', 'principles', 'are', 'important', 'remember', 'make', 'other', 'things', 'work.Rory', 'then', 'three', 'types', 'joints', 'hing', 'joints', 'ball', 'socket', 'joints', 'gliding', 'joints', 'there', 'group', 'students', 'improvising', 'playing', 'concepts', 'provided', 'lock', 'joints', ""n't"", 'teach', 'specific', 'locks', 'rather', 'concept', 'locking', 'allowing', 'students', 'come', 'up', 'different', 'locks', 'joint', 'type', 'apparent', 'watching', 'DVD', 'students', 'have', 'more', 'experience', 'locking', 'joints', 'others', 'students', 'go', 'different', 'type', 'locks', 'Miller', 'shares', 'tips', 'concepts', 'way', 'Principles', 'are', 'illustrated', 'arms', 'legs', 'Miller', 'also', 'gliding', 'joint', 'locks', 'work', 'neck', 'lethal', 'force', 'justified', 'When', 'students', 'are', 'performing', 'locks', 'inexperienced', 'viewer', 'might', 'not', 'learn', 'much', 'do', 'watch', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'be', 'sure', 'listen', 'little', 'things', 'Rory', 'things', 'more', 'importantly', 'try', 'stuff', 'training', 'partner', 'watch', 'DVD', 'program', 'filmed', 'live', 'class', 'are', 'attending', 'class', 'rather', 'Miller', 'instructing', 'right', 'camera', 'many', 'martial', 'art', 'DVD', 'programs', 'are', 'presented', 'will', 'like', '8220', '8221', 'feeling', 'others', 'may', 'prefer', 'more', 'traditional', 'teaching', 'camera', 'approach', 'would', ""n't"", 'get', 'too', 'hung', 'up', 'just', 'learn', 'as', 'much', 'can', 'resources', 'regardless', 'format.The', 'program', 'also', 'drills', 'counters', 'different', 'locks', 'Performing', 'drills', 'allow', 'recognize', 'opportunities', '8220', '8221', 'Miller', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'where', 'can', 'apply', 'lock', 'then', 'know', 'basic', 'principles', 'put', 'one', 'who', 'know', 'many', 'locking', 'techniques', 'training', 'still', 'valuable', 'be', 'able', 'recognize', 'different', 'situations', 'use', 'locks', 'maybe', 'were', 'taught', 'Miller', 'improvise', 'pressure', 'drills', 'will', 'help', 'do', 'just', 'Even', 'do', 'train', 'traditionally', 'joint', 'locks', 'should', 'incorporate', 'Miller', 'drills', 'help', 'develop', 'feel', 'putting', 'locks', 'pressure', 'different', 'positions', 'short', 'program', 'only', 'hour', 'important', 'instruction', 'Get', 'training', 'partner', 'watch', 'together', 'then', 'get', 'mat', 'experiment', 'play', 'around', 'drills', 'material', 'presented', 'here.My', 'first', 'video', 'Paladin', 'Press', 'was', 'joint', 'locks', 'then', ""'ve"", 'done', 'five', 'volume', 'set', 'joint', 'locks', 'Aiki', 'Productions', 'share', 'even', 'know', 'teach', 'joint', 'locking', 'principles', 'techniques', 'still', 'found', 'lot', 'value', '8220', 'Joint', 'Locks', '8221', 'DVD', 'Rory', 'Miller', 'will', 'admit', 'stuff', 'DVD', 'discussed', 'person', 'seeing', 'DVD', 'have', 'reservations', 'recommending', '8220', 'Joint', 'Locks', 'Learn', 'Improvise', 'Joint', 'Locks', 'Pressure', '8221', 'Rory', 'Miller', 'anyone', 'who', 'better', 'understand', 'locks', 'take', 'training', 'level']",Joint Locks

Enter Rory Miller and his new video offering addressing the truth of joint locks.In this 60 minute presentation, Miller provides an in-depth explication on the simplicity and functionality of joint locks, as well as their fundamental weakness and failings.Six principles (maximizing leverage, two-way action, using gravity, &#8216;basing,&#8217; &#8216;stacking,&#8217; and &#8216;gifts&#8217;&#8212;buy the DVD for details) are covered that must be engaged and adhered to in a simultaneous fashion in order for any joint lock to actually work under duress against uncooperative, resistant suspects. He then proceeds to demonstrate how to apply these six principles to the various joints of the body, detailing the specific anatomy of the various types of joints, and how to best apply these principles, making for a lock that actually does what it needs to do.Miller conducts a class with various individuals present, each owning a specific level of skill, and then shows these practitioners the very easy approach to learning and applying joint locks. This provides the viewer with a more realistic example of how we learn these manipulations and how we may apply them on different people, from different angles of approach, while under duress. Miller then demonstrates how easily it is to slip out of, and walk away from, standing joint locks and restraints when all of the six principles are not applied simultaneously.This reviewer began his journey in martial arts, beginning in 1958 with wrestling and Traditional Kodokan Judo. The very first thing one learns in these two disciplines is that to mechanically shut down a human entity not wanting to be mechanically shut down, head and hip control must be forthcoming, simultaneously. I am excited that this truth is finally revealed and demonstrated clearly by a man of skill and experience.A.

1691440,A671GGV9ALOJL,B00HQJ847Y,Arwythur,"[3, 3]","I have all the DVD's and Books created by Sgt. Rory Miller. The information is complete and concise.  This particular DVD explains the mechanics of how to create a joint lock, why they work, etc.  It's not a drawn out technique laden monotonous drone... I have a Blackbelt in Jiujitsu, and frankly, this is a good shortcut to the time spent, (6 years), figuring this all out on my own.  In the system that I studied under, this sort of explanation was reserved for the senior Blackbelts only.  I believe in a traditional teaching system, but this DVD would have made that training 1000% better if I would have had it 35 years ago at the beginning... I recommend this to anyone in Law Enforcement, the military, or in Personal Security who may be required by their job to wrestle with someone instead of just shooting/stabbing them.  This isn't for armchair commandos to watch once and think that they &#34;got it&#34;... (please!, get off the couch and practice!),  Safely!  It's worth it.  I would recommend purchasing this for your Dojo, watching it en masse with the class, and practicing it together, with people who are willing to think and improvise. This isn't going to be something useful to stop someone with murderous or carnal intent, as Sgt. Miller says, this is for the &#34;Drunkle&#34;... that Drunk Uncle who wants a cheap feel... all the way up to the exteme stuff, such as controling the other person until you can get to your weapon.  This is in that gray area between running and shooting, where the &#34;Left Hand Knife&#34;, and secondary weapons may fall. Straight up?

This much anticipated DVD is a pleasant addition to my collection. At a run time of 60 minutes, the information provided is very practical and straight forward. Rory breaks down the concepts of the different joints in the human body, how to manipulate them, and gives the viewer ideas on how to create their own techniques as the situation presents itself. The concepts are very easy to understand and apply, but must be practiced with another person to truly benefit from this creative exercise. Once again, Rory, you never cease to amaze!

In this DVD, Miller demonstrates takedowns and joint locks which can help anyone who learns the basics of the art.Miller demonstrates that the protective moves should be used by maximizing leverage holds and other techniques which can be learned by anyone. He teaches the moves by stressing taking advantage of gravity and basing, stacking and gifts given by the bad guy; these terms are defined and demonstrated in the DVD lessons.Admonitions are given that most of these defensive/offensive moves are not to be learned by rote but rather learned in basic moves and in general practice. Improvisation and learning of the advantage points are more important than learning the same moves over and over.I wanted to watch this DVD because I learned a lot from Miller's earlier DVD, Facing Violence which stresses avoidance rather than confrontation.

I have used joint locks on the street as a police officer and have found them to work most of the time&#8212;meaning, not all of the time. With Rory Miller's insightful approach on teaching and practicing joint locks, I see now where I messed up.Miller doesn't teach a series of locks, although by watching him demonstrate and teach his principles, and then watching his students practice &#34;finding&#34; them, you will inadvertently learn, depending on your experience, one of two new ones or even several.But learning locks isn't what this DVD is about. What makes Miller's approach unique is that he explains the three types of joints and how you can make them hurt, even using less than polished techniques. It's all about recognizing the type of joint&#8212;and Miller shows you how easy that is to do&#8212;and then applying pain to it using your hands, arms, chest, knees, and even your rear end. In short, it's about learning to improvise. Real fights are fast, furious, and fluid situations. If you can&#8217;t improvise, you will come in second place.

You don't know what will be presented to you in a confrontation. My sparring partner in the school may be my gender, age, height and weight, but the mugger may be older, faster, more ruthless. You must stick to principles and improvise under pressure .Knowing simple principles and taking a different mindset, may be just enough to save your life. There  are several points in the DVD which may seem counter intuitive, but if you keep an open mind and a keen eye, it's easy to see an escape route. In one place Mr. Miller shows a scenario practiced in many self defense schools. A person grabs you around the neck to choke. The natural reaction is to struggle, the training reaction is to use grabs, grip, turns, muscles to escape, the new way of seeing the situation is to realize that the fingers are not touching in the back of your neck, so just walk backwards through the open door of the hands.In another example, a small woman is is a wrist lock at the hands of a large man. Mr. Miller asks her if she trusts him. He tells her to push forward, toward the person locking her wrist. Looks like it may break her wrist, but in reality the forward movement drops her lower and releases the lock.There are many masterful ways of seeing the empty spaces and gaps that will allow a double lock or a quick release. you must develop an open mind, have a good, clear eye and some old fashioned guts, along with being willing to practice. I am not familiar with many joint locks, as they have not been a part of my martial training up to this point. I did attend a Shuai Jiao class this afternoon and something that I  viewed in this DVD yesterday stuck in my head. I was able to lock in a grab with one hand, spiral my shoulder into his arm and use gravity to bring him forward, off balance, I was able to turn and drop my hand to his knee without looking down. ( Mr. Miller says if you know where his pinkie is, you know where his elbow is. Following that line of thought I felt where his shoulder was on my back, so I knew where his knee was), one step back and he was on the ground. I'm a 65 year old grandmother with some tai chi, bagua and Xinyi experience, my partner was a male, 25 year old wrestler, with 60 pounds on me.
