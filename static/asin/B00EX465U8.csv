The pluses are the film is made on location, so the scenes of the steppes are authentic,, along with the adjacent mountains. Absolutely breathtaking and Alpine. The narrative structure is strong, keeping the story flowing smoothly. The actors are all native Kazakhs, portraying what must be an accurate visual image of life in the time of warring Mongol tribesmen, complete with yurts, village scenes and epic battles without any evident cgi. ON the other side, as might be expected from a local production, character development and plot continuity are sufficient but not necessarily well developed. Therefore, scenes depicting grief are contained in single instances of loud crying, or heaving rocks as a sign of frustration. Otherwise, the movie was valuable if only to see the faces of those who inhabit this remote region of the earth, in native dress and style, from a time when fabled horsemen rode their durable ponies over endless steppes and ultimately helped shape the destiny of the world.",3,"Kazahkstan, the real thing",1386547200,"12 9, 2013",2013,1037,"['Local', 'production', 'Kazakhstan', 'pluses', 'are', 'film', 'made', 'location', 'scenes', 'steppes', 'are', 'authentic', 'adjacent', 'mountains', 'Absolutely', 'breathtaking', 'Alpine', 'narrative', 'structure', 'strong', 'keeping', 'story', 'flowing', 'smoothly', 'actors', 'are', 'native', 'Kazakhs', 'portraying', 'what', 'must', 'be', 'accurate', 'visual', 'image', 'life', 'time', 'warring', 'Mongol', 'tribesmen', 'complete', 'yurts', 'village', 'scenes', 'epic', 'battles', 'evident', 'cgi', 'other', 'side', 'might', 'be', 'expected', 'local', 'production', 'character', 'development', 'plot', 'continuity', 'are', 'sufficient', 'not', 'necessarily', 'well', 'developed', 'Therefore', 'scenes', 'depicting', 'grief', 'are', 'contained', 'single', 'instances', 'loud', 'crying', 'heaving', 'rocks', 'sign', 'frustration', 'Otherwise', 'movie', 'was', 'valuable', 'only', 'see', 'who', 'inhabit', 'remote', 'region', 'earth', 'native', 'dress', 'style', 'time', 'when', 'fabled', 'horsemen', 'rode', 'durable', 'ponies', 'endless', 'steppes', 'ultimately', 'helped', 'shape', 'destiny', 'world']",Myn Bala: Warriors of the Steppe
