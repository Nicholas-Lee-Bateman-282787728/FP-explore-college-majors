Got so bored and frustrated with it that I stopped it twice and waited a few days until I could try to watch the damn thing again.  I gave it a chance but it still was garbage.  Not much in the gore department but when it was present it wasn't great.  I know it was low budget but I've seen horror flicks that could produce better effects with an even lower ""shoe-string"" budget.  Only notable yet bizarre thing to point out is the existence of ""rednecks"" in Italy.  Go figure!

Searching for a cure amidst a wasteland of carnage and slaughter, they encounter an insane artist, a group of Neo-Nazis and a mysterious teenage girl.I'll admit, the plot is all too familiar for a zombie film. It's one that I've seen hundreds and hundreds of times. Yet, for some reason, I come back for another helping. Why? Maybe it is me hoping that I'll find another zombie film that sets the conventions of zombie films on its' ear.  True, this last year- I've seen some that I'd consider to be cult classics but nothing that would/could topple the most revered zombie films. Heck, I almost didn't purchase Eaters for one sole reason. It had Uwe Boll's name associated with it. If you've read any of my Uwe Boll movie reviews, you'd see that I don't consider him a director of Stephen Speilberg calibur nor do I consider him one of Ed Wood calibur either. The one Uwe Boll zombie flick I ever saw reeked pretty bad so it was on account of that that I hesitated purchasing Eaters. Yet, it nagged at me and I finally gave in and bought it. You know what? I'm glad I did. These first-time directors give us a fine example of fine, albeit flawed, Italian zombie film making. Flawed? mmmhmm, 'fraid so. It's most glaring problem is in its' dialogue. There's just too much of it. After awhile- you find yourself wishing you'd see the hordes of zombies there's supposed to be and alot of heck going down instead.Still, for what it is, Eaters has a retro feel to it that makes it worthwhile..and, in that respect, makes this a zombie film I'd recommend.",4,Eaters......,1362960000,"03 11, 2013",2013,1685,"['world', 'devastated', 'Great', 'Epidemic', 'Humanity', 'overrun', 'hordes', 'living', 'dead', 'Three', 'men', 'may', 'be', 'humanity', 'final', 'hope', 'Searching', 'cure', 'wasteland', 'carnage', 'slaughter', 'encounter', 'insane', 'artist', 'group', 'Neo-Nazis', 'mysterious', 'teenage', 'girl.I', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'plot', 'too', 'familiar', 'zombie', 'film', 'one', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'hundreds', 'hundreds', 'times', 'reason', 'come', 'back', 'helping', 'Why', 'Maybe', 'hoping', ""'ll"", 'find', 'zombie', 'film', 'conventions', 'zombie', 'films', 'ear', 'True', 'last', 'year-', ""'ve"", 'seen', ""'d"", 'consider', 'be', 'cult', 'classics', 'nothing', 'topple', 'most', 'revered', 'zombie', 'films', 'Heck', 'almost', 'did', ""n't"", 'purchase', 'Eaters', 'one', 'sole', 'reason', 'had', 'Uwe', 'Boll', 'name', 'associated', ""'ve"", 'read', 'Uwe', 'Boll', 'movie', 'reviews', ""'d"", 'see', 'do', ""n't"", 'consider', 'director', 'Stephen', 'Speilberg', 'calibur', 'do', 'consider', 'one', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'calibur', 'either', 'one', 'Uwe', 'Boll', 'zombie', 'flick', 'ever', 'saw', 'reeked', 'pretty', 'bad', 'was', 'account', 'hesitated', 'purchasing', 'Eaters', 'Yet', 'nagged', 'finally', 'gave', 'bought', 'know', 'what', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'first-time', 'directors', 'give', 'fine', 'example', 'fine', 'albeit', 'flawed', 'Italian', 'zombie', 'film', 'making', 'Flawed', 'mmmhmm', 'so', 'most', 'glaring', 'problem', 'dialogue', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'awhile-', 'find', 'wishing', ""'d"", 'see', 'hordes', 'zombies', 'supposed', 'be', 'alot', 'heck', 'going', 'down', 'instead.Still', 'what', 'Eaters', 'retro', 'feel', 'worthwhile..and', 'respect', 'zombie', 'film', ""'d"", 'recommend']",N/A

Italian horror movies are known for their over-the-top gore, and this just is not the case.  The FX are not very special, the movie drags on and on, a script is non-existent, and there are no characters that can be found that are the least bit interesting.It seems the world has come upon that much dreaded ""plague"" again, i.e. now (for the most part) the dead have taken over and populate the planet while the few survivors cuss, sit around and drink beer, and cuss some more.  There are only a handful of survivors (supposedly), and they would have done everyone a service if they'd died a long time before the movie was made.  You have your mad scientist, your Billy Bad-A$$, and then three without opposable thumbs.  That should make for a good time, huh?!?  All that...AND the movie is in Italian with English subtitles.  Now, I do not have a problem with subtitles, but you need to take an Evelyn Woods' speed-reading course to keep up with these.  Trust me, though; after a while, you won't care.

1552014,AYG1U47VFZ165,B008FXLZB2,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[1, 1]","Back in the days of the infancy of the home video market, store shelves were chocked full of these wonderfully tacky low-grade movie thrillers.  Most of them were horror films - the kind of stuff with plenty of blood and guts to spare - and, every now and them, one came along that rose to the top.  Eventually, it would be blessed with `B movie status' - the kind of picture that couldn't woo any mainstream stars but, instead, built a reliable audience around quality effects.  The truth is legitimate `splatter' sells pictures, and no one appreciated it more than the folks who flocked to rent these mostly laughably side flicks.Then, there's the stuff that Uwe Boll puts his name on.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last two paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)The Apocalypse is here.  You can thank Uwe Boll for it.  A horrific plague wiped out the female of the species, so mankind is left with no way to propagate itself into the future.  Women are reduced to flesh-eating zombies.  Interestingly enough, there are plenty of male flesh-eating zombies, but apparently just `how' and `where' they came from escaped writer/director Marco Ristori's ""capable"" vision.  Into this world, three men - two soldiers of fortune and one scientist - are hoping they may uncover the secret behind a cure ... so long as they can survive long enough to find it.EATERS is chocked full of - simply put - not so much ""bad writing"" as it is ""downright terrible writing.""  Seriously.  No, I mean ""downright terrible writing.""  I've no doubt the filming experience was the kind wherein director Ristori probably encouraged his talent to throw in an ample amount of F-bombs whenever the spirit so moved them.  So very much of the script makes so little sense that I won't trouble you with the finer points other than to say it involves good scientists versus bad scientists along with the emergence of a new Nazi Party (???).  We learn in the film's opening sequence that things got so bad in this world that even the Pope committed suicide by blowing his head off.Yes, it's that bad.This is the kind of film wherein our two `heroes' announce very early on that they consider it their job to shoot zombies and drink beer ... and, as luck would have it, they're obviously low on beer.And brains.Believe it or not, this script even tries to breathe new life into what's been found to be the world's worst line of dialogue: ""there's a fly in my soup.""Blink it, and you'll miss the cover of ""Girls With Corpses"" Magazine.I poke fun - mostly because it's so easy - but so very much of EATERS makes it the kind of film perfect for MST3K, were they still on the air.EATERS is produced by Extreme Video SNC.  DVD distribution is being handled through Entertainment One (E One).  For those of you who wish to know, this is an Italian spoken language film, and the release offers both an English-dubbed or English-subtitling option.  As for the technical specs, it all looks and sounds about as well as the next Uwe Boll production looks and sounds, which is to say `meh.'  There's a bonus making-of featurette available if you're interested, but I wasn't.NOT REALLY RECOMMENDED.  Granted, for those of you with the patience and the stomach to make it through this stinker from start-to-finish, maybe (maybe, I said) there will be the emergence of some guilty pleasure.  I doubt it.  EATERS is a waste, through and through.  It's beneath B-movie fare.  It ought to be the kind of thing that's an embarrassment to have on one's resume ... well, unless you're Uwe Boll, that is.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Entertainment One (E One) provided me with an advance DVD screener of EATERS for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",1,EATERS Is Best Left Undigested,1362960000,"03 11, 2013",2013,4048,"['Back', 'days', 'infancy', 'home', 'video', 'market', 'store', 'shelves', 'were', 'chocked', 'full', 'wonderfully', 'tacky', 'low-grade', 'movie', 'thrillers', 'Most', 'were', 'horror', 'films', 'kind', 'stuff', 'plenty', 'blood', 'guts', 'spare', 'now', 'one', 'came', 'rose', 'top', 'Eventually', 'would', 'be', 'blessed', 'B', 'movie', 'status', 'kind', 'picture', 'could', ""n't"", 'woo', 'mainstream', 'stars', 'instead', 'built', 'reliable', 'audience', 'quality', 'effects', 'truth', 'legitimate', 'splatter', 'pictures', 'one', 'appreciated', 'more', 'folks', 'who', 'flocked', 'rent', 'mostly', 'laughably', 'side', 'flicks.Then', 'stuff', 'Uwe', 'Boll', 'name', 'NOTE', 'following', 'review', 'will', 'contain', 'minor', 'spoilers', 'necessary', 'solely', 'discussion', 'plot', 'characters', ""'re"", 'kind', 'reader', 'who', 'review', 'entirely', 'spoiler-free', 'then', ""'d"", 'encourage', 'skip', 'down', 'last', 'two', 'paragraphs', 'final', 'assessment', 'however', ""'re"", 'accepting', 'few', 'modest', 'hints', 'things', 'come', 'then', 'read', 'Apocalypse', 'here', 'can', 'thank', 'Uwe', 'Boll', 'horrific', 'plague', 'wiped', 'out', 'female', 'species', 'so', 'mankind', 'left', 'way', 'propagate', 'future', 'Women', 'are', 'reduced', 'flesh-eating', 'zombies', 'Interestingly', 'enough', 'are', 'plenty', 'male', 'flesh-eating', 'zombies', 'apparently', 'just', 'how', 'where', 'came', 'escaped', 'writer/director', 'Marco', 'Ristori', 'capable', 'vision', 'world', 'three', 'men', 'two', 'soldiers', 'fortune', 'one', 'scientist', 'are', 'hoping', 'may', 'uncover', 'secret', 'cure', 'so', 'long', 'can', 'survive', 'long', 'enough', 'find', 'it.EATERS', 'chocked', 'full', 'simply', 'put', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'bad', 'writing', 'downright', 'terrible', 'writing', 'Seriously', 'No', 'mean', 'downright', 'terrible', 'writing', ""'ve"", 'doubt', 'filming', 'experience', 'was', 'kind', 'wherein', 'director', 'Ristori', 'probably', 'encouraged', 'talent', 'throw', 'ample', 'amount', 'F-bombs', 'whenever', 'spirit', 'so', 'moved', 'So', 'very', 'much', 'script', 'so', 'little', 'sense', 'wo', ""n't"", 'trouble', 'finer', 'other', 'say', 'good', 'scientists', 'versus', 'bad', 'scientists', 'emergence', 'new', 'Nazi', 'Party', 'learn', 'film', 'opening', 'sequence', 'things', 'got', 'so', 'bad', 'world', 'even', 'Pope', 'committed', 'suicide', 'blowing', 'head', 'off.Yes', 'bad.This', 'kind', 'film', 'two', 'heroes', 'announce', 'very', 'early', 'consider', 'job', 'shoot', 'zombies', 'drink', 'beer', 'luck', 'would', 'have', ""'re"", 'obviously', 'low', 'beer.And', 'brains.Believe', 'not', 'script', 'even', 'breathe', 'new', 'life', 'what', 'been', 'found', 'be', 'world', 'worst', 'line', 'dialogue', 'fly', 'soup', ""'ll"", 'miss', 'cover', 'Girls', 'Corpses', 'Magazine.I', 'poke', 'fun', 'mostly', 'so', 'easy', 'so', 'very', 'much', 'EATERS', 'kind', 'film', 'perfect', 'MST3K', 'were', 'still', 'air.EATERS', 'produced', 'Extreme', 'Video', 'SNC', 'DVD', 'distribution', 'being', 'handled', 'Entertainment', 'One', 'E', 'One', 'who', 'wish', 'know', 'Italian', 'spoken', 'language', 'film', 'release', 'English-dubbed', 'English-subtitling', 'option', 'technical', 'specs', 'looks', 'about', 'as', 'well', 'next', 'Uwe', 'Boll', 'production', 'looks', 'sounds', 'say', 'meh', 'bonus', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'available', ""'re"", 'interested', ""wasn't.NOT"", 'REALLY', 'RECOMMENDED', 'Granted', 'patience', 'stomach', 'make', 'stinker', 'start-to-finish', 'maybe', 'maybe', 'said', 'will', 'be', 'emergence', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'doubt', 'EATERS', 'waste', 'beneath', 'B-movie', 'fare', 'ought', 'be', 'kind', 'thing', 'embarrassment', 'have', 'one', 'resume', 'well', ""'re"", 'Uwe', 'Boll', 'interests', 'fairness', ""'m"", 'pleased', 'disclose', 'fine', 'folks', 'Entertainment', 'One', 'E', 'One', 'provided', 'advance', 'DVD', 'screener', 'EATERS', 'expressed', 'purposes', 'completing', 'review']",N/A
1552015,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,B008FXLZB2,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[1, 1]","EATERSThis Italian zombie film presented by Uwe Boll is your average B zombie flick but it is worth a watch. Now Boll did not have anything to do with the making of this flick he is just doing his presenter thing here helping get it out there. Now for someone like me who enjoys Boll&#8217;s films [for the good or bad] I had to have this. Now admittedly I would have got this any way for the zombies but Boll&#8217;s name on it made it a must have.This film follows two soldiers that work for a scientist who is working on zombies after the epidemic hit the world. So they are off one day to hunt some down for him as well as other things. Along the way they come across all kinds of characters including a girl who they help. This leads to some not s nice types going after them that may or may not have ties to Hitler, maybe. So they are off trying to survive a world not only of zombies but of neo Nazis as well.This is your typical B movie fun filled flick with zombies and things going boom. The soldiers are fun and the back and forth between them made the movie for me, they reminded me of a few guys I know. The killing and zombie action is there but that kinda goes against what was supposed to happen. As other reviews have pointed out why do they destroy every zombie they come across if they needed to catch some. That is just one of the fun things about this flick.Written by Germano Tarricone and Marco Ristori who also directed with Luca Boni &#8220;Eaters&#8221; is one of those movies that you will love or hate based on your appreciation of B flicks. I liked it as I am sure most who know me would know. The zombies look cool and the action and acting was what I expected it would be. Also it should be noted that these guys made another film together right after this called &#8220;Zombie Massacre&#8221; this time with Uwe Boll on as a producer, I am on my way to that now.",3,UWE BOLL PRESENTS............................YOUR AVERAGE ZOMBIE FLICK,1390435200,"01 23, 2014",2014,1894,"['EATERSThis', 'Italian', 'zombie', 'film', 'presented', 'Uwe', 'Boll', 'average', 'B', 'zombie', 'flick', 'watch', 'Now', 'Boll', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'making', 'flick', 'just', 'doing', 'presenter', 'thing', 'here', 'helping', 'get', 'out', 'there', 'Now', 'someone', 'who', 'Boll', '8217', 'films', '[', 'good', 'bad', ']', 'had', 'have', 'Now', 'admittedly', 'would', 'have', 'got', 'way', 'zombies', 'Boll', '8217', 'name', 'made', 'must', 'have.This', 'film', 'two', 'soldiers', 'work', 'scientist', 'who', 'working', 'zombies', 'epidemic', 'hit', 'world', 'are', 'one', 'day', 'hunt', 'down', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'things', 'way', 'come', 'kinds', 'characters', 'including', 'girl', 'who', 'help', 'not', 's', 'nice', 'types', 'going', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'ties', 'Hitler', 'maybe', 'are', 'off', 'trying', 'survive', 'world', 'not', 'only', 'zombies', 'neo', 'Nazis', 'well.This', 'typical', 'B', 'movie', 'fun', 'filled', 'flick', 'zombies', 'things', 'going', 'boom', 'soldiers', 'are', 'fun', 'back', 'forth', 'made', 'movie', 'reminded', 'few', 'guys', 'know', 'killing', 'zombie', 'action', 'there', 'kinda', 'what', 'was', 'supposed', 'happen', 'other', 'reviews', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'why', 'do', 'destroy', 'zombie', 'come', 'needed', 'catch', 'just', 'one', 'fun', 'things', 'flick.Written', 'Germano', 'Tarricone', 'Marco', 'Ristori', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'Luca', 'Boni', '8220', 'Eaters', '8221', 'one', 'movies', 'will', 'love', 'hate', 'based', 'appreciation', 'B', 'flicks', 'liked', 'am', 'sure', 'most', 'who', 'know', 'would', 'know', 'zombies', 'look', 'cool', 'action', 'acting', 'was', 'what', 'expected', 'would', 'be', 'Also', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'guys', 'made', 'film', 'together', 'right', 'called', '8220', 'Zombie', 'Massacre', '8221', 'time', 'Uwe', 'Boll', 'producer', 'am', 'way', 'now']",N/A

I was thinking that since he had no part in the making of the movie, just responsible for it's distribution, that it might actually be a good film... I was wrong and have FINALLY learned my lesson... I will never waste money on any movie that has Boll's name on it!Like so many other hum drum, bad zombie movies, Eaters suffers from a poor script which makes for a lack of character development. Instead of a handful of hopeful survivors trying to survive, we are given a cast of  characters, who for the most part, are just annoying stereotypes that pop up during the movie with no rhyme or reason, but to just add time and shock to a poorly written movie ... the mad scientist who really LOVES his work, the macho military ""G. I. Joe"" who likes to live dangerously, the weird artist (who should have went by the name Dali instead of Warhol), the inbreed hicks (who`s idea was it to allow these fine specimens of life into their safe haven?), the crazy religious cult leader and a group of ridiculous neo-Nazis led by a ""Mini-Me"" Hitler. Sure, there might be a lot lost on the fact that the movie is dubbed with heavy melodramatic voices, but the movie's dialog was super weak and for the most part unrealistic! ...  It seems the writers of Eaters was more interested in making a movie full of weird characters and gore... It's got Uwe Boll's name on it so I should have known better!Now, with all that said... this is a budget movie that doesn't really look like one. I though the story was interesting, just not written or thought out to have an even / realistic flow! The special effects and makeup was top notch and the actors were great actors... again, maybe it was the dubbing that really  turned me off from this movie... well, that and the majority of bizarre and needless characters!If you are in need of a zombie movie fix, Eaters is worth a CHEAP rental, but after watching it once, I don't think you would be interested in seeing it again!",2,"danger .....

While Boll's name is front and center on the DVD release of the Italian horror endeavor ""Eaters,"" he did not have anything to do with making the picture.  He is just promoting it.  If you don't know who Boll is, he is widely cited as one of the worst directors cranking out movies today and his name is like catnip to lovers of bad movie mayhem.  While ""Eaters"" has moments of inspired lunacy, I'm just not sure that it's good enough (or even bad enough) for a genuine recommendation.  I want to like this low budget film, but I'm largely ambivalent.  While I have an undeniable soft spot in my heart for the flesh eating undead, the zombie genre has been a bit overworked lately with projects (whether in film, TV, or books) of varying degrees of quality. Let's face it, the walking dead are everywhere! I'm certainly not complaining, but it's becoming increasingly difficult to find entertainment that still feels fresh and vital. And the post-apocalyptic squalor that is the setting for ""Eaters"" is all too familiar.The movie starts at some period after the world's population has been decimated by the Great Epidemic.  A small band of survivors (mad scientists, unhinged soldiers, and our bickering heroes) are encamped in a safety zone as the undead walk the earth and the other known survivors include a group of ruthless fascists and a deranged painter.  Our heroes leave base to collect more specimens for the scientist to perform his experiments on.  On the way, they meet these foes and discover a young girl who may be of some import.  There are actually a few really good ideas presented in ""Eaters"" (I won't spoil anything about one of the soldier's former flames), but the screenplay never really follows through with the promise.  I wanted more time in the lab!  Most of the movie, instead, is spent on the road in the more conventional storyline of dispatching zombies.  Nothing here is particularly noteworthy.  And it seems especially odd that they are supposed to be getting zombies and yet they pulverize every one they come across.  Perhaps that's an on-going joke, but it wasn't particularly humorous.This is not some big budget endeavor, the effects are appropriately scaled down.  While not the best gore and zombie effects, I've also seen worse.  This really didn't bother me.  There are moments of genuine humor, some of the conversations the two leads engage in are good for a chuckle or two.  I might easily have given this film three stars.  In the end, I just think that ""Eaters"" falls short in comparison to the many other movies in this genre that you can choose from.  This Italian film isn't all bad, and it had some intriguing plot points I really wanted to see expanded.  As is, though, I probably won't remember the movie in a week so it's hard to recommend a DVD purchase.  I might suggest you check it out as a rental first.  About 2 1/2 stars.

1552019,A3UAIEHXTUT85G,B008FXLZB2,"S. Boone ""TheatreX""","[1, 1]","That's just a sample of the fine dialog in this incredibly random zombie flick.  In some ways the LOOK of the film itself is like Italian zombie flicks from the 80's, and in ways reminiscent of ""Day Of The Dead"", but in other ways, it's like a bunch of random junk all spliced together & presented as a film.  The two main characters are definitely throwbacks to the old-school Italian zombie flicks, but the dialog....wow.  One guy, Igor, breaks into an old Wham! song (Wake me up before you go go) and then assures his colleague that he's not gay...wow...that's too bad, there's one theme they forgot to explore.  The music ranges from hillbilly country to techno, and I guess that's appropriate for this wildly disjointed mess.  Anyway, it just seems like these two hapless (but macho) dorks just kind of roam the countryside performing what seem like useless errands, stopping every once in a while to hack up or shoot some zombies, or have a fight with some neo-Nazi's, and they even stop someplace and find a young girl, who they drive around with in their jeep until she sits up and announces that her name is Christina, and that she has to pee.  Oh, and by the way, the neo-Nazis are led by a midget Hitler.  If it sounds like I'm rambling, it may well be from brain damage incurred during the viewing of this film.  Stay away, it's bad for you...but seriously, if you like to consume lots of recreational drugs & drink alcohol and watch incredibly bad movies, this one might be for you.  I can't in good conscience, though, recommend it to anyone else.",1,"""My name is Christina, and I have to pee""",1362873600,"03 10, 2013",2013,1561,"['just', 'sample', 'fine', 'dialog', 'incredibly', 'random', 'zombie', 'flick', 'ways', 'LOOK', 'film', 'Italian', 'zombie', 'flicks', '80', 'ways', 'reminiscent', 'Day', 'Dead', 'other', 'ways', 'bunch', 'random', 'junk', 'spliced', 'together', 'presented', 'film', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'definitely', 'throwbacks', 'old-school', 'Italian', 'zombie', 'flicks', 'dialog', '.wow', 'One', 'guy', 'Igor', 'old', 'Wham', 'song', 'Wake', 'up', 'go', 'go', 'then', 'colleague', 'not', 'gay', 'wow', 'too', 'bad', 'one', 'theme', 'forgot', 'explore', 'music', 'hillbilly', 'country', 'techno', 'guess', 'appropriate', 'wildly', 'disjointed', 'mess', 'Anyway', 'just', 'two', 'hapless', 'macho', 'just', 'kind', 'roam', 'countryside', 'performing', 'what', 'seem', 'useless', 'errands', 'stopping', 'once', 'while', 'hack', 'up', 'shoot', 'zombies', 'have', 'fight', 'neo-Nazi', 'even', 'stop', 'someplace', 'find', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'drive', 'around', 'jeep', 'up', 'announces', 'name', 'Christina', 'pee', 'Oh', 'way', 'neo-Nazis', 'are', 'led', 'midget', 'Hitler', ""'m"", 'rambling', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'brain', 'damage', 'incurred', 'viewing', 'film', 'Stay', 'away', 'bad', 'seriously', 'like', 'consume', 'lots', 'recreational', 'drugs', 'drink', 'alcohol', 'watch', 'incredibly', 'bad', 'movies', 'one', 'might', 'be', 'ca', ""n't"", 'good', 'conscience', 'though', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'else']",N/A

The government has messed up once again causing a zombie creating virus, except to confuse us, Zombies are called ""Eaters."" Women are affected more easily than men. Our film focuses on one group of survivors who are looking for a cure and are trying to survive at the same time. Two of the muscle men venture out and barter with other pockets of survivors, including a memorable Nazi group who conduct life and death games with the zombies.The plot is a little more involved, but that is basically it. I enjoyed the special zombie effects, the ""living"" body parts and large amounts of blood. The characters were not likeable, in fact you ended up hating the one guy. The film injects humor, at one point our he-man is singing to ""Wham!"" and feels he must explain that he is not gay. However the film has too many points that drag that could have been more effective with some decent dialouge.This is another great zombie film to come out of Italy.
