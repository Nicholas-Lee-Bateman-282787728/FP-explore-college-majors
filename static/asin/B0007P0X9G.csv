885283,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B0007P0X9G,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[3, 5]","I was extremely excited about this film when I first read about it in my entertainment magazines.  It seemed that it was cutting edge, provocative, and something that the world would shun, yet somehow emerge as one of the greatest cinematic stories told.  This is exactly what I thought prior to seeing the film.  Now, after witnessing the sheer dullness of Jonathan Glazer's direction, the methodically slow pacing, and the poorly placed puzzle pieces, this film fell way short of it's goal and my excitement.  A great idea was conceived with this film, but sadly it was the execution and ""life-changing"" moments that had you at utter disbelief instead of amazement.  The foundation of this film was not set correctly, which ultimately caused the rest of this film to be somewhat skewed.  Birth is one of those films that tries to attach itself to your intellect, but instead feeds off your need to know ""what will happen next"".  Sadly, when the answer is nothing spectacular, we are left with hidden words, muddied emotions, and a pathetic film that should not have seen the light of day.I must first say that the plot of this film impressed me.  It is one that you do not see in mainstream Hollywood at all, which I am glad it was explored in the independent circuit.  Here you have a child who believes that he is her dead husband reincarnate.  Imagine having to rebuild your passions and lives with a complete stranger basing everything off of just plain old ""faith"".  That would be tough, and I think Nicole does an exceptional job of showing the bizarre nature of this event.  Her emotional range is superb, ranking among the best Hollywood has to offer, but it is the delivery of the lines, the editing of the film, and the mismatched tone that hurt Kidman's performance.  Director Glazer never quite gives us any answers or characters, but instead just throws us deep into the story as if we are already best friends and long-time acquaintances with everyone involved.  It took me the longest time to figure out who Anne Heche and Peter Stormare were in the film and how they were involved with the overall theme of the story.  It just felt as if we were expected to know more than we were handed.  Walking into the fourth chapter of a book is never as powerful as introducing us one by one from the beginning.While the plot may have impressed me, the story did not.  I never quite felt anything for any of the characters.  Perhaps it was the lack of development, or maybe even the extremely long and pointless shots that Glazer seemed destined to use, but the puzzle pieces never seemed to fit.  Here we had a family that we knew nothing about, a love that we seemed shunned to know about, and people that seemed more like cardboard than living breathing souls.  While Nicole seemed to carry her own, it was the rest of this cast that seemed to flounder.  The child playing the supposed ""Sean"" (Cameron Bright) was good, but not great.  He never quite captured my appeal.  There didn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to his character, which ultimately hurt this picture as well.  From the opening scene with Heche to the final moments in the ocean, there just seemed like there were random tangents that this director was taking us on and as a viewer we were forced to sit and watch.  We could not voice our opinion or ask any questions for fear of being shunned.  Logic seemed like a tool that went unused in this film.  If a monster in a horror film was chasing you into the bedroom and you chose to leave the door open instead of slam shut would seem illogical, so why were there so many doors left open in this film?  Then, in a very classical way, Glazer just ended the story.  It seemed to wrap up in a very quick amount of time that, again, gave us no logical reason why.Finally, I would like to say that with a plot that could be compared to Swiss cheese, and a cameraman that seemed to doze off behind the camera and was allowed to let it run, it has to be up to the actors to carry the film.  If nothing else seems to be working than it has to be up to the director to inspire his actors to bring the rest of the film home.  This did not happen in Birth.  The actions seemed forced, while Nicole seemed to be the only one honestly working during this production.  She carried this film on her shoulders, but could not carry it all the way on her own.  Anne Heche's role seemed implemented at the last time, while Bacall's role didn't seem to fit the overall tone of the film.  Danny Huston tried, but I just didn't know enough about him, nor did I care, to really see the emotion behind his lines.  As the rest of the production came crumbling down, you could really see the strain on the actors.Overall, I have to give Birth credit for the concept, I just thought that the finished product was not developed in the best way.  Instead of engulfing storytelling with passionate players, it forced itself to be this lengthy ""arthouse"" film that honestly gives other powerful films such a bad reputation.  I thought that there was so much more that Glazer could have done to bring us closer to these tragic characters, but instead he kept us at arm length, determined to keep the people to himself.  My only other question has to be, ""Who was Sean?"".  An ultimate question that should have found an answer somewhere in this film, but alas, it was lost at sea.Grade: ** out of *****",2,Is Mr. Reincarnation enjoying his cake?,1117670400,"06 2,

885285,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0007P0X9G,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","`Birth' is one of those eerily commanding films that washes the viewer in this pathos of human anxiety and creates a mood that is so morose you can't help but fall into its trance.  That may sound like a bad thing but it is not; in fact it is far from a `bad thing'.  When I first saw `Birth' I was put off by the fact that I didn't understand it, but then I saw it again and realized that you are not supposed to fully understand it.  The final frames say so much for the realities of grief and longing that I have this intense urge to forgo the rest of my review and just speak of Kidman's masterful performance; but I'll contain myself.The film revolves around Anna and her husband Sean.  The problem is that Sean has been dead for ten years and Anna is soon to marry Joseph.  All is going well in Anna's life until she meets a young (ten years young) boy who claims to be her husband reincarnated.  The claim is immediately shrugged off as preposterous but this boy possesses a knowledge, and intimate knowledge, of Anna and Sean's marital relationship that soon Anna (and even those around her) start to wonder if it is indeed true.The prose itself is strange and it does lead to some awkward and eerie situations, but it is handled with such delicacy and the scenes creep upon you with such subtle grace that you almost forget entirely your feelings of discomfort and just allow the film to take you to those places you never really wanted to go.  For instance, the one scene that garnered so much talk was the bathtub scene between Kidman and Bright.  The scene is above and beyond uncomfortable but each actor approaches it with such dire dedication that the scene becomes a brilliant work of art.  Its awkwardness becomes this overwhelming emotion within us that gives way to genuine feeling.  It's one of those scenes that just `went there' and in the end had to.This film is uplifted by the brilliant cast who all do such a marvelous job with their parts.  Young Cameron Bright is one to watch out for.  He has an eerie maturity about him that will lead to some interesting roles (as if this wasn't one already).  Danny Huston is just marvelous here.  The man has a genuine charm that I find compelling, and as the disgruntled fianc&eacute; we can see his pure unbridled emotion as he faces this young boy threatening to take his love away from him.  We watch him steadily start to believe this boy and thus begin to fear he'll lose everything.  It's such a masterfully constructed performance.That brings me to Nicole Kidman.  What can I say?  I am not one who believes Nicole to be the greatest actress working today.  I actually feel she's a tad overrated.  For every `great' performance there are quite a few mediocre ones, and her choice in film makes it difficult to watch her embrace what talent she does possess.  But there is no denying that her portrayal of Anna is utterly flawless.  In fact, I'm tempted to say that it is her finest performance to date.  As Anna she truly gets under the characters skin and fleshes out the accuracies of a widow's grief.  When I say that the final frames say so much for the realities of grief and longing I'm referring to the pain etched across Anna's face.  She knows her husband, she knows his soul and she can feel him in her soul regardless of what anyone else says.  As we witness her begin to believe this young child we too begin to believe him because if she says he's her husband then he must be.  It's that reality that makes the ending so painful.I also feel as though I must single out director Jonathan Glazer because without his delicate approach this would not have retained any ounce of clarity and would have thus become pretentious and pointless.`Birth' is not a film for everyone.  It is very avant-garde and thus may be too artsy for some people.  It is very ambiguous (or is it) and ends on a very strange note, one that may leave some unfulfilled.  I'm not saying that this film is perfect by any means, because it even took multiple watches for me to fully understand and rally behind it.  In the end, `Birth' is the type of movie that, if watched with the right level of open-mindedness, can prove to be so much more than you bargained for.",4,"Soft, delicate and dark; a film that gets inside you and breeds emotion...",1206921600,"03 31, 2008",2008,4222,"['Birth', 'one', 'eerily', 'commanding', 'films', 'viewer', 'pathos', 'human', 'anxiety', 'mood', 'so', 'morose', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'fall', 'trance', 'may', 'sound', 'bad', 'thing', 'not', 'fact', 'far', 'bad', 'thing', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'was', 'put', 'off', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'then', 'saw', 'again', 'realized', 'are', 'not', 'supposed', 'fully', 'understand', 'final', 'frames', 'say', 'so', 'much', 'realities', 'grief', 'longing', 'have', 'intense', 'urge', 'forgo', 'rest', 'review', 'just', 'speak', 'Kidman', 'masterful', 'performance', ""'ll"", 'contain', 'myself.The', 'film', 'revolves', 'Anna', 'husband', 'Sean', 'problem', 'Sean', 'been', 'dead', 'ten', 'years', 'Anna', 'soon', 'marry', 'Joseph', 'going', 'well', 'Anna', 'life', 'young', 'ten', 'years', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'be', 'husband', 'reincarnated', 'claim', 'immediately', 'shrugged', 'off', 'preposterous', 'boy', 'knowledge', 'intimate', 'knowledge', 'Anna', 'Sean', 'marital', 'relationship', 'soon', 'Anna', 'even', 'start', 'wonder', 'indeed', 'true.The', 'prose', 'strange', 'lead', 'awkward', 'eerie', 'situations', 'handled', 'such', 'delicacy', 'scenes', 'creep', 'such', 'subtle', 'grace', 'almost', 'forget', 'entirely', 'feelings', 'discomfort', 'just', 'allow', 'film', 'take', 'places', 'never', 'really', 'wanted', 'go', 'instance', 'one', 'scene', 'garnered', 'so', 'much', 'talk', 'was', 'bathtub', 'scene', 'Kidman', 'Bright', 'scene', 'uncomfortable', 'actor', 'such', 'dire', 'dedication', 'scene', 'brilliant', 'work', 'art', 'awkwardness', 'overwhelming', 'emotion', 'way', 'genuine', 'feeling', 'one', 'scenes', 'just', 'went', 'end', 'had', 'to.This', 'film', 'uplifted', 'brilliant', 'cast', 'who', 'do', 'marvelous', 'job', 'parts', 'Young', 'Cameron', 'Bright', 'one', 'watch', 'out', 'eerie', 'maturity', 'will', 'lead', 'interesting', 'roles', 'was', ""n't"", 'one', 'already', 'Danny', 'Huston', 'just', 'marvelous', 'here', 'man', 'genuine', 'charm', 'find', 'compelling', 'disgruntled', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'can', 'see', 'pure', 'unbridled', 'emotion', 'young', 'boy', 'threatening', 'take', 'love', 'away', 'watch', 'steadily', 'start', 'believe', 'boy', 'thus', 'begin', 'fear', ""'ll"", 'lose', 'everything', 'such', 'masterfully', 'constructed', 'brings', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'What', 'can', 'say', 'am', 'not', 'one', 'who', 'Nicole', 'be', 'greatest', 'actress', 'working', 'today', 'actually', 'feel', 'tad', 'overrated', 'great', 'performance', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'mediocre', 'ones', 'choice', 'film', 'difficult', 'watch', 'embrace', 'what', 'talent', 'possess', 'denying', 'portrayal', 'Anna', 'utterly', 'flawless', 'fact', ""'m"", 'tempted', 'say', 'finest', 'performance', 'date', 'Anna', 'truly', 'characters', 'skin', 'out', 'accuracies', 'widow', 'grief', 'When', 'say', 'final', 'frames', 'say', 'so', 'much', 'realities', 'grief', 'longing', ""'m"", 'referring', 'pain', 'etched', 'Anna', 'face', 'husband', 'soul', 'can', 'feel', 'soul', 'regardless', 'what', 'anyone', 'else', 'witness', 'begin', 'believe', 'young', 'child', 'too', 'begin', 'believe', 'husband', 'then', 'must', 'be', 'reality', 'ending', 'so', 'painful.I', 'also', 'feel', 'must', 'single', 'out', 'director', 'Jonathan', 'Glazer', 'delicate', 'approach', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'retained', 'ounce', 'clarity', 'would', 'have', 'thus', 'become', 'pretentious', 'pointless.', 'Birth', 'not', 'film', 'everyone', 'very', 'avant-garde', 'thus', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'artsy', 'people', 'very', 'ambiguous', 'very', 'strange', 'note', 'one', 'may', 'leave', 'unfulfilled', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'film', 'perfect', 'means', 'even', 'took', 'multiple', 'watches', 'fully', 'understand', 'rally', 'end', 'Birth', 'type', 'movie', 'watched', 'right', 'level', 'open-mindedness', 'can', 'prove', 'be', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'bargained']",N/A

Even on the  tranquil surface of her face Anna's expression suggests there are emotional scars buried deep within her. She is about to marry Joseph, a man who is strong-willed and arrogant enough to assume a woman will say ""yes"" to him, it's just a matter of time. An offensive and immature character, he only thinks of how things will affect him and what he can get. He sees Anna as a conquest, a pretty girl to have on his arm at parties.When a ten-year-old boy named Sean shows up at a small dinner Anna and Joseph are hosting, everything changes. Sean claims to be Anna's husband and he wants her to listen to what he has to say.Whether it's the tub scene where Anna allows a naked boy to join her while she is bathing or the point when Anna fully accepts the idea that the child is indeed the man she was once married to, ""Birth"" never allows you to feel comfortable. Anna could very well be an intelligent woman outside of her grief (the audience doesn't really know this for sure because little background information is provided on the main characters) but her emotions  get the best of her and suddenly she is as scary as anything from ""Rosemary's Baby"" (she even sports a similiar haircut to Mia Farrow's).For many, ""Birth"" may seem like just a bizarre thriller, memorable because it dares to defy conventions. For others it may be downright disgusting.

The film deals with an unusual subject but definately cannot be considered ungenuine at all.

885291,A1X1N1RHFIOCRF,B0007P0X9G,arthistoryguy,"[1, 4]","""Birth"" sounds like a fairly creepy movie on paper, and it's even creepier on screen... but not necessarily for the reasons you'd hope for.  It's not a scary film, per say, as it's too slow and aloof to be effectively suspenseful, frightening, or absorbingly dramatic.  In that respect, and due to its inept subject matter, it's more disturbingly uncomfortable than anything else.You have a 10 year old boy and a 35 year old woman unclothed together and kissing on the lips.  No matter what the setting, no matter who the actors, that predicament will be disturbing.  Undoubtedly that is precisely what director Jonathan Glazer wanted: his audience to drop their jaws and squirm in their seats.  Unfortunately for Glazer, his story's substance is stale and awkward.  It's a movie that tackles the (horrific? Or joyous?) possibility of reincarnation in a sometimes levelheaded way - you almost believe there could be some depth to such a calamitous romance.  At other times the movie is plain strange and irrational; sometimes oddly comical though it never stops trying to take itself seriously.The acting is above board, however, as one might expect from the volatile Kidman and veteran Bacall.  Young actor Cameron Bright is well-cast as the hauntingly mature leading man--err--leading child. The only thing failing the film is the hackneyed script itself.  It's a risky story even if done perfectly, and the fact that the story flips wildly back and forth before our eyes only to end as unsettlingly as it began (with no real understanding or conclusion) is a recipe for failure.It is interesting, however, to think that perhaps Anna's (Kidman) husband is trapped inside the under-developed body of a prepubescent boy after his sudden death.  For all it's emotional short range, the film tackles raw reactions to this unlikely occurrence.  But, so what? what of it?  We never really get answers to either of those questions and any sort of resolve is lacking.  Our levelheaded heroin becomes unhinged and ditzy and our lead male protagonist comes off as The Omen's Damien (should we check for a ""666"" birthmark?).  Which begs the important question: why should we sympathize with such insidious people?The score, by Alexandre Desplat, is a glorious highlight to this whole affair.  It is mesmerizing and well mannered.  Somehow it managed to fit the bizarre film perfectly (I mean that as a compliment, if I may).  It's menacing and it's beautiful, thanks in part to the heavenly string melodies atop the repetitive synthetic bass lines that throb in your temples.

This movie has no unsolved mystery in it.  See it if you want to enjoy a pretty good flick. WARNING:  Do not read further if you haven't seen this movie.  For the brainless: A kid is bored as he waits for his dad to finish a tutoring session in an upper-class apartment/condo building.  He sits in the foyer where he is friends with the doorman there. After following a woman who comes into the building and then leaves, he sees this woman bury unopened love letters from a wife to her husband, the woman's lover.  (The husband has died from a heart attack while jogging, seen in the opening scene.) He waits for the woman to leave the scene, opens the letters, becomes enamored with the writer through what she has written, fancies himself her reincarnated husband, tells her he is her husband, she starts to actually believe him because he has privileged info derived from the letters, the kid is discovered to be faking or self-deluded by the original woman who buried the letters (and suspects what's going on since the kid does not recognize her as his lover), this woman finds the letters she buried, now open and obviously read, in the kid's backpack, shatters his world by presenting him with the facts of her affair with the actual dead husband, and the kid now realizes the logic of what she has said and tells the widow that he is not her husband.  Case closed!This movie is edgy.  It works pretty well.  It is not a great movie as towards the end Kidman's actions are ludicrous to the point where some watching it started to laugh, but it does take chances.  Some fail, most succeed.

885295,A2582KMXLK2P06,B0007P0X9G,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Birth deserves a ton of credit for presenting an original idea, and executing it in a mostly understandable and satisfying way.  The ending is a bit of a surprise because I really wasn't sure which direction it was going, and for the most part the movie kept me interested and isn't as boring as other reviewers below think it is.Nicole Kidman's character is having a party when a little boy appears in the room and asks to speak to her privately.  She gives in.  They walk into the kitchen and the little boy says in a quiet and concerned voice ""It's me, Sean"".  Of course Nicole has no reason to believe him, he's just a kid.  She takes it as a joke.  But he says it again, and this time she believes it's a sick joke.  This is exactly what I expected to happen.  Great writing due to the believability of Nicole's surprised and emotional facial expressions during this segment.But then... gradually throughout the movie, this kid is able to prove that he HAS to be her late husband because he simply knows too much information pertaining to not only Nicole, but also her other relatives as well (including Sean's relatives).  The boy, played extremely well by the intelligent Cameron Bright, even says ""Ask me anything and I'll tell you"".  It's actually REALLY creepy when you think about it, that writers would come up with such a whacked out/far-fetched idea and base an entire story around it.  Makes me wonder if this movie was intended for helping those of us who've lost close relatives as a way to put our worried minds at ease.I'm a bit baffled why so many people think Birth is a boring movie.  I guess it's boring if you're not into the ""life after death"" concept, which this basically falls under.  At least, if you believe in reincarnation, this kind of storyline could possibly be one element of life after death that I'm sure many of us have thought about before- that our deceased loved ones could come back in the form of a child.I find a couple things about the movie quite unusual, though.  For one thing, the family of Nicole Kidman was completely serious and uptight the entire time.  I mean, there should have been at least a *few* occasions when the family let loose and acted like normal people showing a variety of feelings and emotions, but that's not the case.  These characters, including Nicole Kidman's mother, sister and husband, are constantly serious the entire way through the movie.  It's understandable to act such a way when the little boy releases personal information that nobody else could have known, but I sort of expected happiness to come into the picture at least on a few occasions but it never does.  Ever.  It makes the overall tone of Birth seem even *more* dramatic and sad.It is however, unintentionally hilarious when the soon-to-be husband got upset when it was finally believed the kid IS the reincarnation of Sean, so in one scene he gets upset at the boy for kicking the back of his chair and totally flips out and makes a scene in an attempt to hurt the child.  He flips over chairs and tables, spanks the child and has to be restrained by the other men in the room.  I'm thinking ""Come on, he's just a kid, don't be such a fool!""  However I'm not sure other viewers had the same reaction.  Maybe for other viewers, they actually interpret the child to be Nicole's late husband, so they looked at him more as a grown man and less as an innocent knowledgeable child.  Interpretations pertaining to some of the segments in Birth can be quite fascinating.  However for me, clearly he's still a child regardless WHO he is, so the spanking and flipping out on the part of the husband was totally out of line.Also, I don't think it's *that* abnormal or inappropriate concerning Nicole Kidman's relationship with the child, unless you want to count the time they locked lips outside when Nicole finally gives in and believes the kid really is who he says he is.  This movie does a tremendous job building Nicole's emotions.  Her reactions are perfectly normal the entire time.  She goes from disbelief, to sadness, to anger, to now believing this kid really is Sean.  It's really well done.Also I suppose when Nicole and the kid are taking a bath together... okay, this is probably creepy.  However the way it was presented made it look more like a mother and her son taking a bath together, even though that wasn't the writers intention of course.  By that point into the movie we're sort of led to believe the kid really *is* Nicole's late husband anyway, so it doesn't seem so unusual then either.  If we take this scene out of context though- a grown woman bathing with a child- it would appear creepy and unsuitable then.The final 20 minutes offers the best storytelling.  Let's just say, the kid feels trapped.  He doesn't know what to do or what to think.  Or maybe he *does* know what he's doing and thinking?  You see I can't really spoil the ending because it would make everyone on amazon upset, but the ending could clearly be interpreted in two different ways.  This next part is a slight spoiler so don't read it if you haven't seen the movie.  I'm going to assume what the kid says really IS what happened and stick with that.  I'm referring to the part at the very end when he says ""They never found out what was wrong with me"" or something along those lines.  It's possible the kid could have been lying here due to, without spoiling it, another person eventually entering the picture and causing confusion for the boy which would then involve heartbreak for Nicole Kidman (to put it vaguely).  He could have been protecting Nicole's feelings.Overall, a fairly creative idea for a movie.  I thoroughly enjoyed it but it's not for everyone's taste.  It's exactly what I expected it to be by reading the description so I'm not at all disappointed.  Also, what do you think about Nicole's short hair?  I like it, but it's hard to believe it's actually her.  I'm used to the long blonde hair.  Hard to believe she had a different hairstyle for Birth.

If the film had been more cut-and-dried and attempted to actually explain the bizarre situation at the center of the film, it probably would've only served to disappoint more because the impossible premise at the center of the film is completely fascinating.Days after announcing her engagement to new fiance Joseph, Anna, played by Nicole Kidman in a heavily nuanced performance, is approached by a young boy named Sean during a family birthday party. This 10-year-old Sean claims to be the reincarnation of her dead husband Sean - and tells Anna not to marry Joseph.The film then allows the situation to play out as rationally as possible. Anna and her family first reject the notion as absurd. But then Sean seems to prove himself, and Anna opens herself up to the possibility that the man she grieved over has returned to her.The director Jonathan Glazer and the actors make some very interesting choices about how they approach this material. Kidman conveys very little warmth in her role, and the romantic notions of the story are explored but with a bit of clinical detachment. No one gets particularly passionate, and Young Sean, as played by the brilliant Cameron Bright, isn't so much lovable as he is eerie and persistent.Still, the film features some strong acting, particularly from Bright, who steals scenes from the likes of Kidman and Lauren Bacall.

Levenson ""chubbybuns""","[2, 10]","The premise of""Birth""as has been detailed in over 100 previous reviews is that a young woman,played by Nicole Kidmann,a widow for a decade,is about to re-marry..Suddenly a ten year old boy appears,sneaking into her apartment during a birthday celebration for her  mother,and announces that he is her long dead husband..From this point onward the film,which is has a rather ridiculous plot to begin with,becomes even more ridiculous..The reactions to this rather obsessive behaviour on the part of the boy by all of the adults is about as realistic as the notion that the moon is made out of green cheese..The widow,already pegged as being in fragile mental health before the boy's startling assertions about his alledged idenity becomes even more unhinged,although the manifestations of same are subtle rather than heavy handed and obvious..After some early doubt she falls for his story,as do some of the other adult members of her family..The boy's parents,instead of taking the boy to the nearest shrink instead  let the boy stay overnight at the widow's apartment,thus enabling the mental problems of both widow and boy and letting them grow..While there in the widow's apartment,with the apparent blessing of all of the widow's kin(with the sole exception of ""joseph"" the widow's newly aquired fiance,whose reaction is jealous rage)the widow explores the boy's obsession and,once convinced that the boy is indeed the reincarnated husband,responds to him as if there is nothing wrong with a thirty-something woman being in love with a ten year old boy..This particularly perverse theme is taken to disgusting extremes when the two are both naked together in the same bathtub,and,a little later,ALMOST sleep together in the same bed..Well,it turns out that a little incident at the very begining of the film SHOULD have tipped us all off and,by the way,blown the whole premise of the film to much-deserved bits..The film opens with the engagement party for the widow and""Joseph""..One of the invited guests is Anne Heche,wife of""Clifford"" who had been best man at the widow's first wedding ..Heche tells her husband to go up to the party without her,making some excuse..She then sneaks across the street to a park and disappears into some bushes where she buries a sheaf of papers and thinking that she has not been seen,leaves to attend the party..But she had been seen,by a boy,who had followed her..As it turns out the sheaf of papers are letters ..Heche had been the mistress of Kidmann's first husband and the letters are evidence,and all of the details necessary for someone to know things,intimate things,about Kidmann and her deceased husband..So,obviously,the boy found the letters,read them,and imagined himself to have become the dead husband..Reason enough,when he first says so,for any REAL parent to have him looked at by competent professionals..Also obviously,the widow is in a very fragile state of mental health,and when,very quickly,she buys into the boy's story,the adults around her should have made sure that she too see a doctor,rather than consenting to such perverse things as letting the two be naked together in one of those small,claw-footed white bath-tubs..Some think that this film is""daring"" and ""Brilliant"",but it is a weak story,dependent upon extreme,almost pornographic themes to keep it stumbling along,to a very lame and unconvincing conclusion...",2,A Pretentious Clunker Which Sometimes Borders On Child Pornography,1206662400,"03 28, 2008",2008,3387,"['premise',

Throughout the film, it's occasionally difficult to see where exactly the film is going.  The film opens with a death and a birth, it would seem simultaneously, then moves forward ten years to the engagement party of the characters played by Nicole Kidman and Danny Huston.  Kidman's Anna still lives with memories of former husband Sean, dead now ten years, but has finally put enough of it behind her to remarry.  At this point things go awry, as a ten year old boy arrives claiming to be Anna's dead husband Sean.  The movie then begins trying to sell us on a reincarnation storyline involving the little boy that seems fairly believable, if not supernatural.  Ultimately, other plot devices crop up(namely Anne Heche's character's past with the deceased)and the movie then becomes a little more straightforward it it's execution, though the incoherent ending sequence undermined the movie for me somewhat.  Nevertheless, Nicole Kidman, complete with a pixie cut a la Mia Farrow in ROSEMARY's BABY, gives a typically strong performance, bringing utter conviction and honesty to an atypical role that a lesser actress would probably not know what to do with.  She gets fine support from Huston, Lauren Bacall, Cameron Bright, and Anne Heche(in a brief but vivid turn as a ""friend"" of the family).Ultimately, an odd film that requires strong commitment on the part of the viewer.",3,Odd Film Requires Committed Attention Span,1114819200,"04 30, 2005",2005,1491,"['admirable', 'effort', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'were', 'dumbfounded', 'BIRTH', 'initial', 'release', 'film', 'occasionally', 'difficult', 'see', 'where', 'exactly', 'film', 'going', 'film', 'death', 'birth', 'would', 'seem', 'simultaneously', 'then', 'forward', 'ten', 'years', 'engagement', 'party', 'characters', 'played', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Danny', 'Huston', 'Kidman', 'Anna', 'still', 'memories', 'former', 'husband', 'Sean', 'dead', 'now', 'ten', 'years', 'finally', 'put', 'enough', 'remarry', 'point', 'things', 'go', 'awry', 'ten', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'claiming', 'be', 'Anna', 'dead', 'husband', 'Sean', 'movie', 'then', 'trying', 'sell', 'reincarnation', 'storyline', 'involving', 'little', 'boy', 'fairly', 'believable', 'not', 'supernatural', 'Ultimately', 'other', 'plot', 'devices', 'crop', 'up', 'namely', 'Anne', 'Heche', 'character', 'past', 'deceased', 'movie', 'then', 'little', 'more', 'straightforward', 'execution', 'incoherent', 'ending', 'sequence', 'undermined', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'Nevertheless', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'complete', 'pixie', 'cut', 'la', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'ROSEMARY', 'BABY', 'typically', 'strong', 'performance', 'bringing', 'utter', 'conviction', 'honesty', 'atypical', 'role', 'lesser', 'actress', 'would', 'probably', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'fine', 'support', 'Huston', 'Lauren', 'Bacall', 'Cameron', 'Bright', 'Anne', 'Heche', 'brief', 'vivid', 'turn', 'friend', 'family', '.Ultimately', 'odd', 'film', 'strong', 'commitment', 'part', 'viewer']",N/A

I do wish the ending would have been more clear. I never was convinced that the child was lying, or if he had been fooled by an adult with a secret and slight yearning to hurt the wife of her lover. There's a slight 'porno' scene with Danny Huston for those turned off by naked butts, for the rest of us who can handle adult themes, this sad, slightly surreal movie might be perfect for cleaning out the tear ducts.

And, God knows, I can't really defend some of the movie's weaknesses (several of the characters seem unhinged; the opening line of dialogue is deliberately, narratively misleading; most of the characters sit around repeating variations on, ""I can't believe this is happening"" yet they rarely actually do anything practical; the pace is slow and the tone is cold) and I may, on a second viewing, completely change my positive opinion of this film because most of my enjoyment of it stemmed from wondering what the hell was going to happen next.Still, ""what's going to happen next?"" is a good thing to be wondering in a movie these days, I think, and people who can cut this flick some slack and suspend disbelief might become engrossed by the ride.I was mostly interested in this film because Jonathan Glazer, who made ""Sexy Beast"" directed it.  I have to say, aside from a cool aesthetic and a similar theme (an unusual outsider visits some sheltered, privelaged people and shatters their life) the two films have little in common.  ""Birth"" seems to combine elements of ""Ghost,"" ""My Man Godfrey,"" ""Heaven Can Wait"" and others into a dark lark that eventually becomes something altogether different.But the movie does have a lot to recommend: I particularly enjoyed Harris Zavides photography -- he shot ""Elephant"" and, here, seems to be channeling Gordon Willis' shadowy, New York ambiance used in ""Klute"" and ""Godfather II.""  I also liked Arliss Howard as the hapless brother-in-law Bob, and Anne Heche who makes unhinged (not to mention cuckholding and near-cradle-robbing) seem sexy.  And, again, Nicole Kidman delivers a careful, thoughtful performance.In the end, this is a movie about grief and about the ways that those orbiting someone in pain can affect them.

885312,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,B0007P0X9G,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[0, 0]","The premise of this film may shock some as I know it did many of the critics.  The whole idea of a grown woman falling in love with a ten year old is quite creepy, but there is so much more to this film when you take a step back and look at it from another perspective.  I will address something right off bat and I hope that this doesn't spoil anything for you.  When the credits starting rolling my wife looked at me and said ""what the hell"" and I know why she said that, but the importance to this film is not in the answer to our questions but in our interpritation of the truth.  I'll only say that so as not to give away too much.  The film follows Anna (Kidman) ten years after the death of her husband.  She is now engaged to Joseph (Huston in a powerful performance) and everything seems to be going great for her until a young boy shows his face while she's entertaining family.  This young boy Sean (played by remarkable young actor Cameron Bright) proceeds to tell Anne that he is her late husband reincarnated and that he loves her and wants to be with her and does not want her to marry Joseph.  She initially is upset by this but he persists and she soon starts to believe him...she starts to love him.  This causes a strain on her relationships with everyone from her mother and sister to her fiance and she eventually makes rash decitions that could ruin her life.  Kidman does a brilliant job her playing a woman torn by the life she knows and the life she wants to believe is possible.  It really shows what someone is willing to believe for the sake of feeling the love they lost so long ago.  The charactor I'm so fond of though was Joseph, the fiance who loves his soon-to-be bride but is quickly growing weary of her newfound facination with this child...this child who is insitant in driving Joseph away.  Theres a scene where Joseph loses his head and starts beating Sean and my heart goes out to him.  He is losing everything he has because of some boy with this idea in his head that may or may not be real.  The end leaves you with a question of what to believe and who to believe and whether or not you walk away feeling as I do depends competly on how you look at the matter.  I do want to point out that although this film recieved an R rating there is no language or violence and the sexual content is in reference to one scene lasting a few seconds where Joseph is making love to Anna.  There is some rear nudity on the part of Huston (beefy but w/w) but other than that the film is pretty clean and the scene alone is not pertantent to the story.  I will say though that the subject matter alone is very adult and the feelings that cultivate between Anna and young Sean are very contiversal and may be unsettling especially in the scene where they share a bath together.  All in all this is a work of art that touches upon our inner emotions, not necisarilly in the context that it's portrayed but in general and it asks the question ""how much to we love our mates and if that much what would we do, say and or believe even if it means keeping them in our lives?""",4,Strangely beautiful yet beautifully strange,1138320000,"01 27, 2006",2006,3097,"['premise', 'film', 'may', 'shock', 'know', 'did', 'many', 'critics', 'whole', 'idea', 'grown', 'woman', 'falling', 'love', 'ten', 'year', 'old', 'quite', 'creepy', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'film', 'when', 'take', 'step', 'back', 'look', 'perspective', 'will', 'address', 'something', 'right', 'bat', 'hope', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'anything', 'When', 'credits', 'starting', 'rolling', 'wife', 'looked', 'said', 'what', 'hell', 'know', 'why', 'said', 'importance', 'film', 'not', 'answer', 'questions', 'interpritation', 'truth', ""'ll"", 'only', 'say', 'so', 'not', 'give', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'film', 'Anna', 'Kidman', 'ten', 'years', 'death', 'husband', 'now', 'engaged', 'Joseph', 'Huston', 'powerful', 'performance', 'everything', 'be', 'going', 'great', 'young', 'boy', 'face', 'entertaining', 'family', 'young', 'boy', 'Sean', 'played', 'remarkable', 'young', 'actor', 'Cameron', 'Bright', 'proceeds', 'tell', 'Anne', 'late', 'husband', 'reincarnated', 'be', 'not', 'want', 'marry', 'Joseph', 'initially', 'upset', 'soon', 'believe', 'love', 'strain', 'relationships', 'everyone', 'mother', 'sister', 'fiance', 'eventually', 'rash', 'decitions', 'could', 'ruin', 'life', 'Kidman', 'brilliant', 'job', 'playing', 'woman', 'torn', 'life', 'life', 'believe', 'possible', 'really', 'what', 'someone', 'willing', 'believe', 'sake', 'feeling', 'love', 'lost', 'so', 'long', 'ago', 'charactor', ""'m"", 'so', 'fond', 'though', 'was', 'Joseph', 'fiance', 'who', 'soon-to-be', 'bride', 'quickly', 'growing', 'weary', 'newfound', 'facination', 'child', 'child', 'who', 'insitant', 'driving', 'Joseph', 'away', 'scene', 'where', 'Joseph', 'head', 'beating', 'Sean', 'heart', 'out', 'losing', 'everything', 'boy', 'idea', 'head', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'real', 'end', 'question', 'what', 'believe', 'who', 'believe', 'not', 'walk', 'away', 'feeling', 'do', 'depends', 'competly', 'how', 'look', 'matter', 'do', 'want', 'point', 'out', 'film', 'recieved', 'R', 'rating', 'language', 'violence', 'sexual', 'content', 'reference', 'one', 'scene', 'lasting', 'few', 'seconds', 'where', 'Joseph', 'making', 'love', 'Anna', 'rear', 'nudity', 'part', 'Huston', 'beefy', 'w/w', 'other', 'film', 'pretty', 'clean', 'scene', 'alone', 'not', 'pertantent', 'story', 'will', 'say', 'subject', 'matter', 'alone', 'very', 'adult', 'feelings', 'cultivate', 'Anna', 'young', 'Sean', 'are', 'very', 'contiversal', 'may', 'be', 'unsettling', 'especially', 'scene', 'where', 'share', 'bath', 'together', 'work', 'art', 'inner', 'emotions', 'not', 'necisarilly', 'context', 'portrayed', 'general', 'question', 'how', 'much', 'love', 'mates', 'much', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'say', 'believe', 'even', 'keeping', 'lives']",N/A

The boy tells Anna that he is Sean, implying that this is not only in the name he bears, but also in the sense that he is in fact her dead husband come back to life. This bizarre revelation is explored through the duration of the film.An experiment in what some would consider ""the ridiculous,"" Birth forces one to suspend disbelief early on, and when the moviegoer finally fails to keep his or her disbelief fully suspended, which he or she will fail to do, eventually, and inevitably--and this before the first act is even over--the only thing that will maintain interest in the film is plain ol' curiosity--in this case, to see where the film will go, and what will become of the characters. This is a major credit to the filmmakers, especially director Jonathan Glazer, whose eye toward atmosphere and pacing is particularly keen. In lesser hands the film would have fallen apart, but Glazer, despite the movie's farfetched premise, manages to hold our interest by delivering on suspense. Each of his scenes moves the story marginally closer to what we long for: to learn whether the 10-year-old boy, named Sean, is truly the Sean who was married to Anna (Nicole Kidman) before dying during a routine jog in Central Park 10 years earlier; and, if it is him, what will become of the relationship between him and Anna?We're essentially talking about reincarnation here. Sean certainly gives us enough to go on, revealing intimate knowledge of past experiences only the real Sean could know, but when the film decides to take a sharp turn toward the end, everything that led up to ""the truth"" we'd decided to embrace is suddenly thrown into confusion, allowing our doubt to resurface--as well as Anna's.Beyond this, there are moments in the film that will cause some audience members to literally cringe, given the awkward pairing of a boy and a woman, and the adult situations they are placed in (situations that are handled tastefully, I might add). For instance, there is a scene in the film that has the supposedly reincarnated Sean (Cameron Bright) stripping down to his briefs in Anna's bathroom, while Anna is waiting in her bathtub, watching him. Sean eventually climbs in, and the tense moment of silence between them reverberates well beyond the screen.There is another scene prior to the one above that places the pair in what appears to be a caf&eacute;, and they hold an interesting discussion over two cups of ice cream. ""A man has to support his wife,"" Anna says. ""He has to feed her, defend her, take care of her. How're you gonna feed me, defend me . . . take care of me? How're you gonna do that?"" Without hesitating, Sean replies: ""I'll get a job."" And after a long pause, Anna asks: ""How're you gonna fulfill my needs?"" Sean swallows, and, without returning her gaze, he says, ""I know what you're talking about."" Anna continues: ""You ready for them?"" When Sean offers no response, Anna continues: ""You ever made love to a girl?"" At this, he finally sets eyes on her, and licking his spoon for the umpteenth time, he says, in all seriousness, ""You'd be the first.""This awkward relationship, and the brilliant performances by Kidman and Bright that give rise to it, is what makes the film work for the most part. And it is also why I would recommend that you give the movie a try, if your sensibilities will allow you to stomach a few demanding scenes.",4,"Not for the Faint of Heart, But an Interesting Experiment",1328918400,"02 11, 2012",2012,3527,"['boy', 'birthday', 'party', 'held', 'ritzy', 'Manhattan', 'duplex', 'pretty', 'woman', 'named', 'Anna', 'step', 'aside', 'private', 'conversation', 'boy', 'Anna', 'Sean', 'implying', 'not', 'only', 'name', 'also', 'sense', 'fact', 'dead', 'husband', 'come', 'back', 'life', 'bizarre', 'revelation', 'explored', 'duration', 'film.An', 'experiment', 'what', 'would', 'consider', 'ridiculous', 'Birth', 'forces', 'one', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'early', 'when', 'moviegoer', 'finally', 'keep', 'disbelief', 'fully', 'suspended', 'will', 'fail', 'do', 'eventually', 'inevitably', 'first', 'act', 'even', 'only', 'thing', 'will', 'maintain', 'interest', 'film', 'plain', 'curiosity', 'case', 'see', 'where', 'film', 'will', 'go', 'what', 'will', 'become', 'characters', 'major', 'credit', 'filmmakers', 'especially', 'director', 'Jonathan', 'Glazer', 'eye', 'atmosphere', 'pacing', 'particularly', 'keen', 'lesser', 'hands', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'fallen', 'apart', 'Glazer', 'movie', 'farfetched', 'premise', 'hold', 'interest', 'delivering', 'suspense', 'scenes', 'story', 'marginally', 'closer', 'what', 'long', 'learn', '10-year-old', 'boy', 'named', 'Sean', 'truly', 'Sean', 'who', 'was', 'married', 'Anna', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'dying', 'routine', 'jog', 'Central', 'Park', '10', 'years', 'earlier', 'what', 'will', 'become', 'relationship', 'Anna', ""'re"", 'essentially', 'talking', 'reincarnation', 'here', 'Sean', 'certainly', 'enough', 'go', 'revealing', 'intimate', 'knowledge', 'past', 'experiences', 'only', 'real', 'Sean', 'could', 'know', 'when', 'film', 'take', 'sharp', 'turn', 'end', 'everything', 'led', 'up', 'truth', ""'d"", 'decided', 'embrace', 'suddenly', 'thrown', 'confusion', 'allowing', 'doubt', 'resurface', 'as', 'well', ""Anna's.Beyond"", 'are', 'moments', 'film', 'will', 'cause', 'audience', 'members', 'literally', 'cringe', 'given', 'awkward', 'pairing', 'boy', 'woman', 'adult', 'situations', 'are', 'placed', 'situations', 'are', 'handled', 'tastefully', 'might', 'add', 'instance', 'scene', 'film', 'supposedly', 'reincarnated', 'Sean', 'Cameron', 'Bright', 'stripping', 'down', 'briefs', 'Anna', 'bathroom', 'Anna', 'waiting', 'bathtub', 'watching', 'Sean', 'eventually', 'tense', 'moment', 'silence', 'well', 'screen.There', 'scene', 'prior', 'one', 'pair', 'what', 'be', 'caf', 'eacute', 'hold', 'interesting', 'discussion', 'two', 'cups', 'ice', 'cream', 'man', 'support', 'wife', 'Anna', 'feed', 'defend', 'take', 'care', 'How', ""'re"", 'gon', 'feed', 'defend', 'take', 'care', 'How', ""'re"", 'gon', 'do', 'hesitating', 'Sean', 'replies', ""'ll"", 'get', 'job', 'long', 'pause', 'Anna', 'How', ""'re"", 'gon', 'fulfill', 'needs', 'Sean', 'swallows', 'returning', 'gaze', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'talking', 'Anna', 'ready', 'When', 'Sean', 'response', 'Anna', 'ever', 'made', 'love', 'girl', 'finally', 'eyes', 'licking', 'spoon', 'umpteenth', 'time', 'seriousness', ""'d"", 'be', 'first', 'awkward', 'relationship', 'brilliant', 'performances', 'Kidman', 'Bright', 'give', 'rise', 'what', 'film', 'work', 'most', 'part', 'also', 'why', 'would', 'recommend', 'give', 'movie', 'try', 'sensibilities', 'will', 'allow', 'stomach', 'few', 'demanding', 'scenes']",N/A

In some ways it plays as the straight version for the earlier Sherpherd, Downey effort.Nicole Kidman plays Anna, who ten years ago lost her husband Sean. In fact the movie opens with the death of one Sean in Central Park and the birth of another. Years later Anna is about to get remarried when she is startled at her engagement party to Joseph (played excellently by Danny Huston) by the appearance of a ten year old boy claiming to be the reincarnation of her long-dead husband.Initially dismissive of the boy, she eventually becomes more and more convinced (as do those around her) that the boy is indeed Sean as he answers questions put to him that she believes only her husband could have answered.To the credit of those involved all the principal actors turn in very admirable performances from Kidman through to Anne Heche and screen legend Lauren Bacall.Both shocking as a `beyond the grave"" thriller. And controversial, as tale of obsession by an older woman for a younger man (just view the bath tub scene) this movie is ably summed up in a line of dialogue given by Kidman's Anna late in the movie - ""It doesn't make sense.""

One might take seriously the notion that in a film set in  in a remote village in Ireland, in 1864,  an obviously deranged young woman would be allowed to commit child abuse on a ten year old boy, without being put into the hands of  the psychiatric profession, willingly or unwillingly; but to have it occur today, in a NYC setting, within a professional family of some apparent means, having a  medical man either as a member of the family or a close friend, lacks any credibility. Of course, one can build a film (Rosemary's Baby) so that the most bizarre behavior conforms to theatrical (not mathematical or philosophic) logic but that is not the case here. I can't go beyond the general statement without revealing more of the story, but it should be clear that I was quite uncomfortable with both the premises and the behavioral outcomes from those premises.Bound by a shaky script, the actors did well not to embarrass themselves.  Mostly, the disjointed narrative made it difficult for anyone, but Kidman, to be coherent , the one playing her character's fiance being made a particular victim.It was hard to pin down just what relationship most of the characters had to Kidman's character, save for the mother, sister and fiance; this added to the generally incomprehensible nature of the action.I should add that, if you can suspend judgment on the basic premise, then you might well find the film entertaining.

And Jonathan Glazer takes a risk with ""Birth,"" a bizarrely beautiful film about reincarnation and spiritual ties -- a risky maneuver, but one that pays off. The result is beautiful and strangely solemn.A jogger named Sean dies in the park -- and a baby is born. Ten years later, the jogger's widow Anna (Nicole Kidman) is reluctantly celebrating her engagement to yuppie fiancee Joseph (Danny Huston). Suddenly a ten-year-old boy named Sean appears (Cameron Bright) and announces that he is Anna's husband, reincarnated into a boy's body.At first, Joseph tells the kid he's wrong, and Anna brushes the kid off as a nasty prankster. But Sean knows intimate details about her marriage, and has a strange passion behind his claims. She begins to believe that he is telling the truth -- that he is her Sean, reborn. She reexamines her life and her future, as old wounds reopen and questions are raised.A lot of fuss has been made over ""Birth's"" nude bath scene. Don't worry -- it's not sexual or prurient, but strange and almost surreal. It takes guts to include such a scene, even in a movie that is more about the spiritual than the physical. In a nutshell, it's a movie with heart (even if a logical brain is a little lacking)And that scene aside, the movie is richly ambient, darkly beautiful, and raises an array of troubling questions. Is Sean really a reincarnation, or is he simply a young boy who worships a thirtysomething woman? Does Anna simply want to believe he is? And is spiritual love enough to conquer all? These questions, by the way, are left hanging in the air -- to do otherwise would seem almost silly.The movie moves at a very, very slow pace -- it takes patience to fully absorb it. But the atmosphere is strangely dreamlike, slow and sensuous and almost outside real time. The outdoors is snowed over, and the interiors are beautiful and quiet. The final quarter is thought-provoking and open to interpretation, but does suffer from a rather unsatisfying feel.Nicole Kidman does a magnificent job in this film. She takes the character of Anna and fills her with overwhelming emotion. In one powerful scene, she attends an opera with Joseph, and the camera lingers on her face and eyes; Kidman communicates silently everything Anna feels. Cameron Bright does a somewhat more spotty job -- with Kidman, he successfully comes across as a grave man-in-a-boy's-body. With anyone else, he just seems sullen. And Lauren Bacall gives a solid, sometimes funny performance as Anna's mom.While it never entirely addresses its own issues, ""Birth"" is a magnificent, atmospheric film, with a spiritual twist.

885322,A1R2URG8OHNEDS,B0007P0X9G,"Ed Mich ""Ed""","[4, 8]","The following review contains brief crucial spoilers. I'll write when I plan on using them, but without the spoilers I won't be able to mention a reason why I didn't like this movie.""Birth"" is one of those movies where you are always asking ""How?"" and ""Why?"" Sadly, I was asking ""How and why could  this movie have been made?"" It really wasn't too good. The plot could sound like a comedy too. A women finds out that a ten year old boy is the reincarnate of her dead busband. This movie is not a comedy, but there were certain things that made me laugh that were not supposed to. The movie stars Nicole Kidman, who has been making quite a few movies in the recent months. There is also Lauren Bacall, Danny Huston from ""Silver City,"" and young Cameron Bright. Bright was the boy in ""Godsend"" a couple of months ago, and his preformance in that was creepy, but that was for character. It was creepy in this movie too, but it wasn't supposed to be. He only smiles once throughout the whole movie, and that is at the very end. In fact, none of the characters seemed to have emotion. The entire thing was on one emotional level, and it never got off it. Everybody was selfish too. Lauren Bacall was pretty much pointless. There was way to much wrong with this movie, than it could be right.I'll start with the plot. Nicole Kidman played Anna, whose husband Sean died while jogging. The cause of his death is never really explained, but you do see it happening. Right when he dies, a baby is born. Ten years later, Anna is visiting the grave of her husband, and she is also engaged to marry Joseph. At the party of her mother Eleanor, a young ten year old boy comes in and claims to be Sean. Anna at first thinks that it is a joke, but the boy keeps coming back, expecially focusing on telling her not to marry Joseph. Young Sean is very mature for his age, and soon Anna doesn't know what to think. She and Joseph talk to the boy's parents, but he doesn't leave her alone, and when his mother tries to talk to him, he says that he is not their ""stupid son"" anymore. They decide to ask him questions that only Sean would know, and when he knows alot, Anna begins to believe that he could be the reincarnate of her husband. This doesn't sit well with Eleanor and Anna's sister, claiming that the entire thing could be illigal, and Anna must decide what she wants to do, and what she wants to believe.SPOILER START! I had a problem with the ending. There is a reason why the boy can't be Sean, and that is explained, but it is never explained why he knew so much, and how is so much like Sean, but one little thing changes that. It's very ridiculous, and I was no satisfied. SPOILER END!The young boy is also TOO serious. I already said that he doesn't smile once throughout the whole movie, and if he used to be her husband, he really wasn't very charming and a person that I would like to hang out with. All of the characters stay at one emotional level. Lauren Bacall was also terrible. She has the same expression on her face throughout the whole movie. The best part about this movie was the music and Nicole Kidman. The music had such a haunting, hopeful feel to it, and it made me smile whenever I heard the theme. Nicole Kidman was great in this movie, and she brought the best part to the screen. There is one scene where we are focused on her face for about two minutes as she begins to believe what the little boy is telling her. You can see exactly the point when she is changing her mind. Another scene is similiar, at the start with the adult Sean running in the snow for about two minutes. Unlike watching Kidman's face, it is utterly pointless. There was also the pointless Anna and Joseph brief sex scene that just plain annoyed me. They could have shown something different as a way to show, at that point, her still loving him.People might because uneasy with the bathtub scene with Anna and Young Sean inside of it, but nothing happens.

885323,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0007P0X9G,Ed Uyeshima,"[1, 5]","There's a fine line between audaciously provocative and downright creepy, and unfortunately, director Jonathan Glazer crosses it way too many times in this oddly discomforting 2004 film. However, the biggest sin he commits is instilling its enervating pace and presenting its bloodless, cipher-like characters. With its relentlessly beige tones and sense of upscale ennui, it reminds me somewhat of Woody Allen's 1978 Bergmanesque detour, ""Interiors"", but with the metaphysical questions it raises, I have a feeling Glazer is going more for the off-kilter vibe of M. Night Shyamalan's 1999 neo-classic, ""The Sixth Sense"".Co-written in a resolutely elliptical manner by Glazer, Milo Addica and Jean-Claude Carri&egrave;re, the story starts with the sudden death of Sean, a young husband out for a jog in Central Park, and then cuts to a decade later when his widow Anna prepares to remarry. At her mother's birthday party, a ten-year old boy enters unannounced and claims to be her late husband. The rest of the movie focuses on everyone's attempts to discredit the boy, while Anna grapples with her lingering feelings of grief and hope about the possibility of reincarnation. You would think passions would run high with this sort of set-up, but there is just one outburst about an hour into the film. Otherwise, the characters merely take in the fantastical story with jaundiced aplomb. Perhaps there is a contemporary realism in their lack of emotional response, but it simply makes for lifeless drama for the rest of us.At least Nicole Kidman makes a valid attempt at credibility as Anna within the confines of the preposterous structure. She achieves a few moments of genuine poignancy, for example, the lingering close-up of her anxiety-ridden face at the opera, but her character's emotional turnaround is handled in such a truncated manner that her later scenes feel utterly preposterous. With his opaque blue eyes, Cameron Bright is just a little too spooky as the unmovable boy, an eerie cross between Damien from ""The Omen"" and an extra from ""Children of the Corn"". Perhaps it was intentional to cast such an unsentimental child in the role, but it is ironically he, not Kidman, who lends an unsettling twinge to their infamous bathtub scene and another scene where he and Kidman kiss on the street.Danny Huston, who seems to be stuck playing the most unsavory parts in films, plays Anna's slow-burn fianc&eacute;e Joseph in such an unhinged manner that you don't want Anna to marry him regardless of the story. Lauren Bacall lends atypical deadpan support as Anna's mother, as she is completely robbed of her larger-than-life persona. Arliss Howard and Alison Elliot have even less to do in their roles as the questioning in-laws, and I am completely baffled by the appearance of stage legend Zoe Caldwell as a family acquaintance. A skeletal-looking Anne Heche plays a pivotal role in unlocking the central mysteries, but the handling of her character and the ensuing situation is an unmitigated botch. In fact, there is next to no satisfaction to the ending, which seems to avert completely the metaphysical questions the film raises.

But there's something strangely eerie about this movie that has stuck in my head ever since. I can't NOT stop thinking about it no matter how hard I try. And for that reason alone I would call this a successful movie.One thing that has to be said is that this film moves at a VERY slow pace. This is definitely not a film for the moviegoer with a low attention span. This film's strong point is in the quiet, subtle moments, often with the camera simply focusing on an actor's face and allowing the audience to fully absorb what they're feeling. And the music, which I believe was composed by Alexandre Desplat (Girl With A Pearl Earring) is perfect for the movie and adds to the ambient, dark and moody atmosphere. I'm even thinking of buying the album score when it's released.While Nicole Kidman & co. give a great performance, I think Cameron Bright who plays the young Sean steals the show. Although he only has one facial expression for 99% of the time, it's his demeanor and way of delivering his lines which are so effective. Remember, this movie isn't about what we can clearly see and understand in front of us; it's about what we *cannot*.Inevitably, there is a lot of controversy and heated discussions about the bathtub scene with Kidman and Bright. While certainly risky and very unconventional, I wasn't put off by it. After all, there is nothing really sexual about it, as Nicole does NOT want him to be there with her and asks him to get out of the tub. The only sexual scene occurs between Kidman and Huston (fiance Joseph), 2 consenting adults. It's this scene, not the bathtub scene, that got this movie an ""R"" rating. And honestly, I think this softcore porn scene was out of place in the movie. It's a typical Hollywood scene in an atypical non-Hollywood movie. It's as if the film-makers put it there in order to 1) hopefully attract a wider audience and 2) diverge people's attention from the bathtub scene by saying ""look everyone, THIS is the only real sexuality in this movie, between Nicole and her fiance."" This brought down the movie a little for me, although nothing too major.But overall, ""Birth"" is a recommended movie. I see it as a quiet, subtle film that digs into our deepest psychological thoughts, often without us even realizing it. It doesn't spoon-feed us the plot but rather, presents us with a blank white canvas and lets us paint our own painting, which in the end will represent what WE want it to. Even the end of ""Birth"" is not clear-cut and will be open to different interpretations. But that doesn't take away it's effectiveness.A movie for those who like to think.",4,"A different kind of thriller.

It's about the peculiarity of the human condition, of love, of loss and how we deal and don't deal with those most fundamental aspects of life.I very much regret that I did not see this movie when it was in release as it is shot with such beauty and grace, and its score -- which almost serves as another character -- is so sonorous and rich that it deserves to be experienced in a theater. It is full of courage, on the part of the writers, the actors (Nicole Kidman, in particular, is just stunningly good), the director, cinematographer and producers. And I have newfound respect for New Line for backing and releasing such a challenging film.That said, as already noted, it's not for everyone.

This movie is horrible and for reasons worse than the pedophilic bath scene or NAWBLA (North American Woman-Boy Love Association) kiss.In order for a movie like this to work, the characters must be likeable, familiar, and believable.  First let's tackle likeable.  The viewer does not get to ""meet"" any of the characters--none of them.  How is it I ""know"" Venkman in Ghostbusters but Anna (the main character) is a complete stranger?  I must only assume bad writing plagued the film, for all of the Amazon experts LOVED her performance.  I believe the director intended significance for several characters in Birth.  Is the brother-in-law pathetic?  Who, exactly, was Sean's best man?  Is Anna's mother warm or distant?  Why would she leave her daughter alone if the daughter is showing signs of absolute insanity?One other reviewer discussed familiarity.  Do these upper class New Yorkers work?  They seem to have offices and moderate social circles but most people can't identify with 3500 square foot penthouse apartments and no discernible income stream.  This disconnect makes the audience somewhat apathetic to the characters' plight.**Potential Spoiler?**The most important missing piece here: believability or credibility.  This kid does not act like an adult.  He speaks in very simple English, plays on swingsets, and sits and stands like a kid.  There is no gleam of experience or even intelligence in his eyes.  How does Anna's family not go over her head to press charges against the boy?  The brother-in-law alludes to this in the beginning by noticing that everything the boy says could be researched or overheard.  We seem to dance past this fact.If this is a film about mental illness and I missed the point then apologies are in order.  If this movie can be encapsulated in the ""brilliance"" of the Longest Theater Scene Close Up, the value is lost on a view like me.  Admittedly, I don't get into ""weird for weird's sake"" movies.  When I drink, I don't extend my little finger.  I cannot look at a blank canvas or glass cube of urine and appreciate the simple beauty.  Perhaps that is to blame for my lack of enjoyment.Grief is powerful, but I simply do not accept the premise that a seemingly normal woman is deluded by nothing more than a child.  Again, I kept waiting for the boy to impress me with more than words but the film left me disappointed.I'm not saying to avoid this movie.  If you like those urine exhibitions, buy this movie!",2,Unbelievable.

But then I read so many positive reviews that I determined to see it, and was very glad I did. I'm always intrigued when a review says essentially ""it's almost impossible to describe what's good about this in a review, but it's a really great movie."" And that's how this was.You have to just deal with the premise. Just deal with it and move on, because that's not what it's about. The premise is, as with any story, just a framework to hang a story on, and the fact that this one is thinner than usual I think is used purposefully to direct your attention away from plot points and toward the emotional reality of the characters and story.You'd also better get used to the idea that the explanation you're going to get at the end is not going to wrap everything up. But if you're really following the movie, by then you won't care.One of the joys of this movie is the reliance on technique. The movie begins with a wonderful high steadicam shot following a jogger through wintery Central Park [bare trees against a gray sky will become a recurring visual motif], while the first piece of the wonderful score by Alexandre Desplat plays. There are a great many sequences here in which there is no dialogue, just the amazing score [which finds a way to USE the spare repetition of Philip Glass to emotional effect, something I've never actually heard in Philip Glass] and careful compositions. There are also a great many long takes, and long takes of the actor's faces. One of these you've probably read about; the long take of Nicole Kidman at the opera, trying to hold it together and focus as a storm of emotion rages within her. But there are a great many more of these, none quite as electrifying as that one, but all fascinating nonetheless.And it's just such a thrill to have some intelligent filmic TECHNIQUE to follow!The performances are all very good, but Nicole Kidman's really stands out. She creates such a convincing character, and so confidently goes into the most outwardly ridiculous scenes, she alone takes the viewer with her. She has a number of standout scenes, and it's a shame that no one paid enough attention to this movie to give her the accolades for her work that she deserves. She has a scene in here [tucking in the bed] that is the equivalent of Shelly Duvall finding her husbands ""novel"" in The Shining, and is just as creepy. Go, Nicole! It's great that she does movies like this instead of just chucking it all for the likes of The Stepford Wives.Cameron Bright also does an excellent job of seeming legitimately adult, and Danny Huston conveys a domineering and slightly evil force that comes into play as the movie moves toward its conclusion.This movie is more about psychological truth than literal truth, and you just have to deal with that. It builds to a climax that, if you've allowed yourself to be drawn into the story, will stay with you for a few days. Although the shot of Nicole's face at the opera gets the majority of the attention, it was the last shot of the film that I found terribly harrowing and haunting.This was the best new movie I've seen in more than a year.",4,"Ignore the dippy premise, this is a great movie",1181347200,"06 9, 2007",2007,3210,"['saw', 'preview', 'heard', 'premise', 'thought', 'WHAT', 'F***', 'then', 'read', 'so', 'many', 'positive', 'reviews', 'determined', 'see', 'was', 'very', 'glad', 'did', ""'m"", 'always', 'intrigued', 'when', 'review', 'essentially', 'almost', 'impossible', 'describe', 'what', 'good', 'review', 'really', 'great', 'movie', 'how', 'was.You', 'have', 'just', 'deal', 'premise', 'Just', 'deal', 'move', 'not', 'what', 'about', 'premise', 'story', 'just', 'framework', 'hang', 'story', 'fact', 'one', 'thinner', 'usual', 'think', 'used', 'purposefully', 'direct', 'attention', 'away', 'plot', 'points', 'emotional', 'reality', 'characters', 'story.You', ""'d"", 'also', 'better', 'get', 'used', 'idea', 'explanation', ""'re"", 'going', 'get', 'end', 'not', 'going', 'wrap', 'everything', 'up', ""'re"", 'really', 'following', 'movie', 'then', 'wo', ""n't"", 'care.One', 'joys', 'movie', 'reliance', 'technique', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'high', 'steadicam', 'shot', 'following', 'jogger', 'wintery', 'Central', 'Park', '[', 'bare', 'trees', 'gray', 'sky', 'will', 'become', 'recurring', 'visual', 'motif', ']', 'first', 'piece', 'wonderful', 'score', 'Alexandre', 'Desplat', 'are', 'great', 'many', 'sequences', 'here', 'dialogue', 'just', 'amazing', 'score', '[', 'way', 'USE', 'spare', 'repetition', 'Philip', 'Glass', 'emotional', 'effect', 'something', ""'ve"", 'never', 'actually', 'heard', 'Philip', 'Glass', ']', 'careful', 'compositions', 'are', 'also', 'great', 'many', 'long', 'long', 'actor', 'One', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'read', 'long', 'take', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'opera', 'trying', 'hold', 'together', 'focus', 'storm', 'emotion', 'rages', 'are', 'great', 'many', 'more', 'none', 'quite', 'as', 'electrifying', 'one', 'fascinating', 'nonetheless.And', 'just', 'such', 'thrill', 'have', 'intelligent', 'filmic', 'TECHNIQUE', 'follow', 'performances', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'really', 'out', 'convincing', 'character', 'so', 'confidently', 'most', 'outwardly', 'ridiculous', 'scenes', 'alone', 'viewer', 'number', 'standout', 'scenes', 'shame', 'one', 'paid', 'enough', 'attention', 'movie', 'give', 'accolades', 'work', 'scene', 'here', '[', 'tucking', 'bed', ']', 'equivalent', 'Shelly', 'Duvall', 'finding', 'husbands', 'novel', 'Shining', 'just', 'creepy', 'Go', 'Nicole', 'great', 'movies', 'instead', 'just', 'chucking', 'likes', 'Stepford', 'Wives.Cameron', 'Bright', 'also', 'excellent', 'job', 'seeming', 'legitimately', 'adult', 'Danny', 'Huston', 'domineering', 'slightly', 'evil', 'force', 'play', 'movie', 'conclusion.This', 'movie', 'more', 'psychological', 'truth', 'literal', 'truth', 'just', 'have', 'deal', 'climax', ""'ve"", 'allowed', 'be', 'drawn', 'story', 'will', 'stay', 'few', 'days', 'shot', 'Nicole', 'face', 'opera', 'majority', 'attention', 'was', 'last', 'shot', 'film', 'found', 'terribly', 'harrowing', 'haunting.This', 'was', 'best', 'new', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'more', 'year']",N/A

Much of that style though is lifted whole from Rosemary's Baby.  Both the general visual 'look' of the film, and its handling of time and events.  Furthermore the main female character is entirely modelled on the character of Rosemary - her personality, the way in which she confusedly mumbles her dialogue (and the very gist of the dialogue itself), her entire deportment, right down to the hideous hair cut!This is neither good nor entirely bad, but ultimately the film falls down in its development of the plot (which was a little thin to begin with) in a way that Rosemary's Baby does not.  The mystery of the boy and who he really is remains unsolved, but not in a way that is supposed to intentionally leave the viewer wondering, but rather as a conceptual failure.  Not only is nothing resolved, but everything that had been established throughout the film is brought to naught, with nothing to take its place.  This is an abdication of the story teller's duty, and makes for an unsatisfying experience.  One also has to wonder at the significance of the title 'Birth', all things considered..The musical score is not to be scoffed at, but considering the opportunities this film offered for musical contribution it does not live up to everything it could have been.In conclusion, I can forgive the film for much since the makers set out to attempt to do something different and potentially interesting, but this alone can hardly compensate for the short comings.

The need to know that our souls reinhabit other beings as the temporary corporal form dies has been studied for centuries and finding a director of the caliber of Jonathan Glazer who distills so much of the ambiguous responses to the concept reincarnation is enough to celebrate.That Glazer respects the dignity of the subject so highly that he draws upon actors of the first rank, cinematographers who understand the associated quality of mystery, and the gifts of the superb composer Alexandre Desplat to surround the mood in gossamer scoring, is very much to his credit.The story by now is well-known:  Anna (a radiant and multidimensional Nicole Kidman) is preparing to marry Joseph (Danny Huston) after ten years of grieving her husband Sean who died while running through Central Park.  At the engagement party in the home of her wealthy mother Eleanor (Lauren Bacall) a strange young ten-year-old boy arrives and very quietly announces that he is Sean (Cameron Bright) and that he is there to plead with Anna not to re-marry.  The remainder of the movie deals with how this possibility of Sean's credibility is approached: many twists and turns keep the story focused like the mystery it is depicting.But most of the film is communicated in extended soliloquies of quiet: lingering camera moments on faces, on pauses in dialogue, on places are nowhere better used than those that pause on close-ups of Nicole Kidman's face - a face that can reveal more emotional depth, agony, passionate need to believe, and revelation than most other actresses today.A quiet, contemplative film, well cast, well acted, well photographed and miraculously scored, by a director who knows his medium.

SPOILERS BELOW!!!!!Well, it's obvious that if you're a reincarnation of someone, you will know every facet of their life, yet the boy didn't know Heche was his mistress.Heche's character makes it clear she buried letters from Kidman to Kidman's husband. The dead husband, Sean, gave the letters unopened to Heche to prove he loved her more. Heche buried them while the boy was watching her, and then ""Sean"" dug them up after she left the park. He read them and THAT'S how he knew so much. The letters were in his backpack the whole time.",3,The BIRTH of a Nation.

I was slightly irritated with the movie as well because the ending felt like the director was laughing at me and saying, ""gotcha"".  On the other hand, this film is a treat for those who have an appetite for psychoanalytical storylines.Storyline:  Based on the trailers, I went in expecting a movie based on supernatural phenomenon- reincarnation.  This is a movie of a woman (played by Nicole Kidman) still in love with her deceased husband.  The film starts out ten years after the death with a ten year old boy showing up at her doorstep claiming to be the reincarnation of her husband.  Kidman (who is nothing but brilliant as a torn woman) who is initially skeptical starts to believe the boy.  Ending: heartbreaking.  Turns out the boy had found some of Kidman's old letters and somewhere in his mind started to believe he was the deceased man reborn.  Well another analysis could be that towards the end when the boy learns of his infidelity to Kidman's character in his previous life, his fear of her finding out is more overbearing than him having her in his new birth.Perhaps the director was trying to rationalize the theme of reincarnation.  He takes a middle of the road option which sort of leaves a lot of room for either side of the thinker to draw their own conclusions.  I believe this dilemma where we had to use our own thinking, was the root of much displeasure to an audience more in tune with definite conclusions.So psychoanalyze this: Kidman who spent ten years getting over her husband is back to square one. The boy really believed that he was her husband.This is a technically brilliant movie- from sets to acting, to direction and narration.",4,***Spoilers Included*** ---  Re Birth,1099267200,"11 1, 2004",2004,1772,"['end', 'movie', 'witnessed', 'one', 'most', 'audibly', 'dissatisfied', 'audience', 'leave', 'theater', 'was', 'slightly', 'irritated', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'ending', 'felt', 'director', 'was', 'laughing', 'saying', 'gotcha', 'other', 'hand', 'film', 'treat', 'who', 'have', 'appetite', 'psychoanalytical', 'storylines.Storyline', 'Based', 'trailers', 'went', 'expecting', 'movie', 'based', 'supernatural', 'phenomenon-', 'reincarnation', 'movie', 'woman', 'played', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'still', 'love', 'deceased', 'husband', 'film', 'out', 'ten', 'years', 'death', 'ten', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'showing', 'up', 'doorstep', 'claiming', 'be', 'reincarnation', 'husband', 'Kidman', 'who', 'nothing', 'brilliant', 'torn', 'woman', 'who', 'initially', 'skeptical', 'starts', 'believe', 'boy', 'Ending', 'heartbreaking', 'out', 'boy', 'had', 'found', 'Kidman', 'old', 'letters', 'somewhere', 'mind', 'started', 'believe', 'was', 'deceased', 'man', 'reborn', 'Well', 'analysis', 'could', 'be', 'end', 'when', 'boy', 'infidelity', 'Kidman', 'character', 'previous', 'life', 'fear', 'finding', 'out', 'more', 'overbearing', 'having', 'new', 'birth.Perhaps', 'director', 'was', 'trying', 'rationalize', 'theme', 'reincarnation', 'middle', 'road', 'option', 'sort', 'lot', 'room', 'side', 'thinker', 'draw', 'own', 'conclusions', 'believe', 'dilemma', 'where', 'had', 'use', 'own', 'thinking', 'was', 'root', 'much', 'displeasure', 'audience', 'more', 'tune', 'definite', 'conclusions.So', 'psychoanalyze', 'Kidman', 'who', 'spent', 'ten', 'years', 'getting', 'husband', 'back', 'square', 'one', 'boy', 'really', 'believed', 'was', 'husband.This', 'technically', 'brilliant', 'movie-', 'sets', 'acting', 'direction', 'narration']",N/A

A woman has lost her husband and somehow after a ten year period, a small boy appears proclaiming he is the reincarnated soul of her deceased husband. The premise is palatable and the acting is brought to the point of acceptability, with the talents of Nicole Kidman and Lauren Becall. However, during the film one becomes aware that something beyond credulity is being glossed over. The age of the two individuals. The older woman eventually accepts her late husband's spirit in the form of the young boy and therein lies the problem. Even if it's accepted that an older woman could in fact love a little boy, the fact of the matter is, if the roles were reversed, and it was an adult man and a ten year old girl in the bathtub, women's groups from one side of the country to the other would be screeching at the top of their lungs that this film is nothing short of child molestation!

Unlike many of the films made today, it doesn't think the viewer is stupid and everything needs to be explained down to every little last detail. By that alone, I find this film to be exceptional experience.The premise, I have to admit, is quite extreme. A woman's life is turned upside down when a young boy shows up at her door, literally, and claims to be her first dead husband. She is only too eager to believe it is true.However, I didn't find the story to be this films strength, but the emotion it was able to communicate through visuals and music. This film is shot quite beautifully. Rich colors, elegant set designs, dramatic lighting, grainy quality that evoke the memories of old film footages, they are all wonderful just to stare at. The music is also fantastic, doing a wonderful job complimenting the story and the scenery and not overpowering them, yet letting its presence be known.What the visuals and the music achieve is evocation of feelings. Kind of feelings when one is watching an old 8mm footage. Feelings of memories. Sweetness, love, longing, bitterness, regret, hope, and such feelings that people dearly hold on to. I find this to be the strength of this movie and its approach totally refreshing. It doesn't explain or show or tell. It lets the viewer experience, through vision and sound.Another factor that greatly contributes to this film's effectiveness is Nicole Kidman. Although I seldom find her acting to be of much notice, she was quite powerful in this film, allowing her expressions and gestures to communicate. One good example is the concert hall scene, just moments after she witnesses the boy, who claims to be her dead husband, collapse in shock. The camera remains focused on her, while the music plays in the background. She is shaken. Really shaken up. The boy has gotten to her. She might be starting to believe.I have read some review that describe this scene as completely ludicrous, because camera remains on Nicole Kidman for so long and nothing happens. I disagree. Those who felt this scene ineffective neglected to appreciate her nervous expression, almost like that of a woman who got caught daydreaming being with another man, and the music, sound of brewing turmoil and passion.If you are willing to engage the film, not wait to be engaged, then I think you will find this film to be quite different and memorable.",5,"Minimalistic, Mysterious, and Elegant.",1115510400,"05 8, 2005",2005,2411,"['film', 'definitely', 'different', 'many', 'films', 'made', 'today', ""n't"", 'think', 'viewer', 'stupid', 'everything', 'needs', 'be', 'explained', 'down', 'little', 'last', 'detail', 'alone', 'find', 'film', 'be', 'exceptional', 'experience.The', 'premise', 'have', 'admit', 'quite', 'extreme', 'woman', 'life', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'when', 'young', 'boy', 'up', 'door', 'literally', 'claims', 'be', 'first', 'dead', 'husband', 'only', 'too', 'eager', 'believe', 'true.However', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'story', 'be', 'films', 'strength', 'emotion', 'was', 'able', 'communicate', 'visuals', 'music', 'film', 'shot', 'quite', 'beautifully', 'Rich', 'colors', 'elegant', 'set', 'designs', 'dramatic', 'lighting', 'grainy', 'quality', 'evoke', 'memories', 'old', 'film', 'footages', 'are', 'wonderful', 'just', 'stare', 'music', 'also', 'fantastic', 'doing', 'wonderful', 'job', 'complimenting', 'story', 'scenery', 'not', 'overpowering', 'yet', 'letting', 'presence', 'be', 'known.What', 'visuals', 'music', 'achieve', 'evocation', 'feelings', 'Kind', 'feelings', 'when', 'one', 'watching', 'old', '8mm', 'footage', 'Feelings', 'memories', 'Sweetness', 'love', 'longing', 'bitterness', 'regret', 'hope', 'such', 'feelings', 'people', 'dearly', 'hold', 'find', 'be', 'strength', 'movie', 'approach', 'totally', 'refreshing', ""n't"", 'explain', 'show', 'tell', 'viewer', 'experience', 'vision', 'sound.Another', 'factor', 'greatly', 'film', 'effectiveness', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'seldom', 'find', 'acting', 'be', 'much', 'notice', 'was', 'quite', 'powerful', 'film', 'allowing', 'expressions', 'gestures', 'communicate', 'One', 'good', 'example', 'concert', 'hall', 'scene', 'just', 'moments', 'boy', 'who', 'be', 'dead', 'husband', 'collapse', 'shock', 'camera', 'focused', 'music', 'background', 'shaken', 'Really', 'shaken', 'up', 'boy', 'gotten', 'might', 'be', 'starting', 'believe.I', 'have', 'read', 'review', 'scene', 'completely', 'ludicrous', 'camera', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'so', 'long', 'nothing', 'happens', 'disagree', 'who', 'felt', 'scene', 'ineffective', 'neglected', 'appreciate', 'nervous', 'expression', 'almost', 'woman', 'who', 'got', 'caught', 'daydreaming', 'being', 'man', 'music', 'sound', 'brewing', 'turmoil', 'passion.If', 'are', 'willing', 'engage', 'film', 'not', 'wait', 'be', 'engaged', 'then', 'think', 'will', 'find', 'film', 'be', 'quite', 'different', 'memorable']",N/A

885346,A2GAK89B29KSKX,B0007P0X9G,"J. Kruppa ""JKruppa""","[25, 31]","Let's try something different here.Birth is a film with a compelling idea at its center -- what if someone you loved deeply were to die, and then ten years later a child showed up and said he or she was that person reincarnated -- that just blows its opportunities in so many ways that a laundry list of its failures, miscalculations and pretentions really wouldn't serve any purpose at all.  So let's make believe for a moment that I'm a script editor who has just received the shooting script and possibly even the storyboards for Birth.  I've been asked by the studio to make some comments for the director, Jonathan Glazer, because some executive had a moment of clarity and felt something was missing from the project and thought Mr Glazer would actually give a damn about my observations (I know this is a stretch, but we're in Fantasyland now, so stay with me).These would be my notes (there are spoilers, for those who haven't seen the film):- First, let's be clear -- this film is about grief.  Whether or not the ten year old is actually the reincarnation of the dead husband is, for the moment, secondary.  The character of Anna has been grieving for ten years over the loss of her husband, and the audience needs to feel some approximation of why she is grieving in order to get on board emotionally with the rest of the story.  A few short scenes at the beginning of the film should introduce this man and establish the relationship between him and Anna.  Nothing heavy handed, just character-building.  We need to like him as a person, and we need to feel the warmth between them.  Introducing him through a voice over on a blank screen discussing a question of reincarnation, as you do here, is a cheat to the audience and a very clumsy, obvious way of establishing the ""set-up.""- Consider changing the setting of the story in order to help it resonate with as many viewers as possible. Your characters are by and large rich, privileged New Yorkers living in luxury.  While this group of people has just as many troubles as the rest of us, most people won't be able (or care) to relate to them.  Your characters don't seem to have jobs and don't really seem to do much of anything that real people do, but your central issue here -- grief -- touches all of us.  I suggest making your characters middle class, and use this as an opportunity to examine the ""quiet desperation"" (as TS Eliot called it) of these people.  I believe this will also help warm up the characters and make them more human, which you need to do even if you maintain the setting.- Given the implausibility of the little boy's assertion, the other characters never ask enough questions, never talk enough, never express themselves enough to deal with the question in a realistic manner.  It's not just Anna, after all, who would miss the dead man and still be grieving in some way.  And even if they're not, the skepticism would be overwhelming and would result in, if not outright interrogation, some sort of response from all of them.  If the point here is to have characters who are closed off from their emotions and can't communicate with each other, accentuate this idea more, and then use the little boy's appearance as a means of exploring (and exploding) the issue.  An effective story ultimately sees its characters change throughout the course of its plot, and the little boy is poised within this story to bring remarkable insight and transformation in at least one, if not many, of the other characters.- The ultimate explanation for how the boy knows what he knows is unsatisfying in the extreme because of what I've mentioned in the above paragraph about the likelihood of others questioning him at length.  It answers the question ""is he or isn't he?"" but does so at the expense of believability.  It also makes the boy out to be a budding sociopath for whom we have no sympathy, which again goes back to the issue of allowing the audience to connect with your characters.  I suggest something bold -- make the reincarnation real.  If you are loathe to venture into the area of the supernatural, take The Sixth Sense as your model of a film that succeeds as a human drama regardless of the supernatural element.  This will also take the emphasis off the ""suspense"" aspect of the story (which doesn't work) and will allow you to focus on the grief theme as well as give the boy more depth.  If he really is this man reincarnated whole cloth, he will be confused and in pain as well.  There won't be an easy way out of this situation, but if underplayed it could be very powerful (see The Sweet Hereafter for another example of an effectively underplayed exploration of grief).- As you can see, most of my comments above refer to issues of characterization.  Whether or not you choose to take my advice on any of the finer points, I advise having your characters make more believable decisions based on who they are as people.  This will require further thought on your part in regard to their individual personalities and backgrounds, but the story will be stronger as a result of this attention.- My last remarks involve the score you want to use for the film.  After reviewing your notes and listening to the rough sketches by the composer, I advise taking a more subtle approach.  The music you have here is at odds with the tone the film needs.  Rather than forming an emotional undercurrent for each scene, the score stands out too prominently on its own and upstages the action, as if to say ""look at me, I'm the film score.""  A film score should always be in service to the emotional underpinnings of the story and should be integrated in such a way that it becomes part of the overall tapestry of the experience, not something that distracts attention from it.  For lessons in effective film scoring, see Bernard Herrmann's work on Vertigo (which deals with obsession as opposed to grief, but has parallels to this story).  Oh, and lose the upbeat swing tune you want for the end credits.  It's a slap in the face to both the characters and the audience, considering the emotional maze you've just led them through.",1,Needs reworking...and here's how,1114732800,"04 29,

First there was the terribly uneven, if still memorable The Human Stain.  Then came the glossy, but hollow Cold Mountain, and I had the distinct feeling Nicole was not giving her all (it was a very understated performance). After the mess of The Stepford Wives, and only Dogville reinforcing my belief in Nicole's ability, I began to wonder if the 'bloom' that propelled her to superstardom in Moulin Rouge and The Others had truly faded. I was wrong!Nicole Kidman's performance in Birth is her best since The Hours, and one of the best in her career. Considering she has had two of her greatest performances this year (Dogville and Birth), I would be deeply disappointed if she didn't receive a Golden Globe and/or Oscar nomination.The film itself has deeply divided critics and audiences. When I saw it in the theater, many of the people were audibly disappointed with it. Nobody seemed to 'get it.'  All I can say is it is a beautiful, unforgettable, and thought-provoking film. It is an unconventional love story about the possibilities of reincarnation.

Alas, my subsequent 45 years have been permanently scarred.Here, Kidman plays Anna, a New Yorker whose husband, Sean, dropped dead while jogging in Central Park ten years before. She's had a rocky time getting over it, but has healed to the point that she's accepted a marriage proposal from Joseph (Danny Huston). The future seems bright until a mysterious 10-year old boy (Cameron Bright) crashes the birthday party for Anna's mother (Lauren Bacall) to announce privately to Anna that he's her dead husband. Anna's initial reaction is ""Yeah, right!"", but, after additional meetings with Young Sean, she becomes totally convinced. Joseph, of course, begins to feel his fianc&eacute;e slipping away, and gets really grumpy.BIRTH doesn't have the delicious creepiness of, say, THE SIXTH SENSE. During the middle third or so of the film, we do believe Young Sean's claim, but only because Anna does and not from any evidence that the boy overtly presents. Then later, when the true nature of the situation is revealed, the director's timing is off because the audience learns before Anna. At this point, the plot lost credibility and I lost interest. Yeah, OK, all the young lads in my third grade class, including me, were smitten with our teacher, a blonde, leggy ex-stew for TWA. (This was 1958, when flying and ""flight attendants"" were still glamorous.) But, when she announced she was leaving to marry some Other Guy, no one of us, devastated as we were, contemplated claiming to be her dead uncle, or whatever, and persuading her to give the bum up.BIRTH has its good points. Kidman turns in another terrific performance for her r&eacute;sum&eacute;. Indeed, a couple of times the camera lingers long and lovingly on a close-up of Anna's face, allowing admirers of Nicole to lose themselves in her exquisite beauty. (Tom, you fool!) And young Bright got his jollies, presumably.BIRTH is simply a story of a young woman derailed in her effort to put a lost love behind her.

SOUTH,"[5, 5]","This is perhaps not quite a review, as much as it is a series of free-form ideas to increase your appreciation of this film.Although I can see why ""Birth"" was generally panned by critics, it is an extremenly hard movie to pigeon-hole, because there has NEVER been anything quite like it. Plot-wise, it has very little in common with ""Rosemary's Baby"", and ""Audrey Rose.  My point is that there is no reference or precedent for a reviewer to compare this film to.  Stylistically, ""Birth"" does recall Stanley Kubrick's techiniques (classical music soundtrack and extremely long takes that allow the actors free reign to not rush, but feel their way completely through a scene to its logical end), and its production design definitely mimics ""Rosemary's Baby"", although I'm not sure to what purpose. Despite its lingering pace, I was not bored for a second.  There is no empty space in this movie.  Every instant is filled with thoughts and emotions, however restrained they may sometimes be.One thing that struck me about ""Birth"" is the portrayal of Anna (Nicole Kidman) and her Upper West Side family and friends.  Opulent though they are, we somehow don't envy or identify with them at all, in their empty, zombie-like existance.  Only young Sean (Cameron Bright), his parents, and even the bizarre Claire (Anne Heche) and her husbannd, Bob, seem enviable and real in all their glorious human imperfections.  The more Sean disrupts and brings these disparate groups together, the more alive and emotional Anna and her family becomes.  Oddly, I read very littlein ""Birth's"" reviews that even touched on the deliciously wacky and mysterious Heche character who provides the plot-line with almost all of its gas.Finally,(and this is not a spoiler): if you see ""Birth"" for the first time, or if you choose to see it again, pay careful attention to the ""letters scene"" between Sean and Claire, taking special note of the handwriting and the paper used.  Does it look like it belongs to a reasonably stable, adult male?  And when an explanation is given as to why the letters were written to one person, and then given to another instead, does it make any sense whatsoever???  One of the characters is lying, and one is being protective, but don't take for granted which is which.On the opposite side of the ""ambiguous ending"" issue, ask yourself why, out of all the more befitting titles available, did director Jonathan Glazer choose the name ""Birth""?  The focus of the film is not really zeroed in on physical birth at all.  The ""births"" are only passing incidentals in the script.  I could easily see, thinking about it in hindsight, how the title could refer to the birth of an idea or a hatched plan.  Is it Sean's idea?  Is it Claire's scheme??  Is it both???There is far more to ponder about ""Birth"" than you may have originally thought.",4,"Pure, thought-provoking cinema",1099353600,"11 2, 2004",2004,2839,"['perhaps', 'not', 'quite', 'review', 'as', 'much', 'series', 'free-form', 'ideas', 'increase', 'appreciation', 'film.Although', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'Birth', 'was', 'generally', 'panned', 'critics', 'extremenly', 'hard', 'movie', 'pigeon-hole', 'NEVER', 'been', 'anything', 'quite', 'Plot-wise', 'very', 'little', 'common', 'Rosemary', 'Baby', 'Audrey', 'Rose', 'point', 'reference', 'precedent', 'reviewer', 'compare', 'film', 'Stylistically', 'Birth', 'recall', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'techiniques', 'classical', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'extremely', 'long', 'allow', 'actors', 'free', 'reign', 'not', 'rush', 'feel', 'way', 'completely', 'scene', 'logical', 'end', 'production', 'design', 'definitely', 'Rosemary', 'Baby', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'purpose', 'lingering', 'pace', 'was', 'not', 'bored', 'second', 'empty', 'space', 'movie', 'instant', 'filled', 'thoughts', 'emotions', 'however', 'restrained', 'may', 'sometimes', 'be.One', 'thing', 'struck', 'Birth', 'portrayal', 'Anna', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Upper', 'West', 'Side', 'family', 'friends', 'are', 'somehow', 'do', ""n't"", 'envy', 'identify', 'empty', 'zombie-like', 'existance', 'Only', 'young', 'Sean', 'Cameron', 'Bright', 'parents', 'even', 'bizarre', 'Claire', 'Anne', 'Heche', 'husbannd', 'Bob', 'seem', 'enviable', 'real', 'glorious', 'human', 'imperfections', 'more', 'Sean', 'disrupts', 'disparate', 'groups', 'together', 'more', 'alive', 'emotional', 'Anna', 'family', 'Oddly', 'read', 'very', 'littlein', 'Birth', 'even', 'touched', 'deliciously', 'wacky', 'mysterious', 'Heche', 'character', 'who', 'plot-line', 'almost', 'gas.Finally', 'not', 'spoiler', 'see', 'Birth', 'first', 'time', 'choose', 'see', 'again', 'pay', 'careful', 'attention', 'letters', 'scene', 'Sean', 'Claire', 'taking', 'special', 'note', 'handwriting', 'paper', 'used', 'look', 'reasonably', 'stable', 'adult', 'male', 'when', 'explanation', 'given', 'why', 'letters', 'were', 'written', 'one', 'person', 'then', 'given', 'instead', 'make', 'sense', 'whatsoever', 'One', 'characters', 'lying', 'one', 'being', 'protective', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'granted', 'opposite', 'side', 'ambiguous', 'ending', 'issue', 'ask', 'why', 'more', 'befitting', 'titles', 'available', 'did', 'director', 'Jonathan', 'Glazer', 'choose', 'name', 'Birth', 'focus', 'film', 'not', 'really', 'zeroed', 'physical', 'birth', 'births', 'are', 'only', 'passing', 'incidentals', 'script', 'could', 'easily', 'see', 'thinking', 'hindsight', 'how', 'title', 'could', 'refer', 'birth', 'idea', 'hatched', 'plan', 'Sean', 'idea', 'Claire', 'scheme', 'far', 'more', 'ponder', 'Birth', 'may', 'have', 'originally', 'thought']",N/A

Kidman, as always, is a fine actress and she does her best to save the film. The actor who plays the boy is credible, even if he has to look primarily moody and serious and...intense.Where film veers off course is when the boy starts to act ""husbandly"" towards Kidman, including at least one scene implying full nudity between the two. It was clearly filmed in a way where the child was not shown fully nude but still..he and Kidman are in a bathtub together and they both LOOK nude (although I'm sure there were special devices so that they weren't completely exposed). Still, the image of a 10 year old boy in a bathtub with an adult woman just creeped me out and things only got more uncomfortable from there.Also, even if this boy IS her reincarnated husband, the viewer has to stretch belief quite a bit, as these questions are never fully explored:1. Would she truly fall in love with him again if he had the body of a 10 year old boy? Would she stay with him till he matured? How would they live? How would they support each other, emotionally, financially and (yes, gotta go there) physically?Ugh. Sorry. I like speculative fiction as much as anyone.

The secret being that she had engineered his death herself!  [Is it a spoiler if you refer to something that you're just speculating about?]  That was the SIXTH sense type ending we were looking forward to but alas, it didn't happen.  Maybe they filmed those pages and cut them after tepid audience response at a sneak?  Anyway in this film version Nicole Kidman is no killer, just super neurotic.And beautifully filmed by Harris Savides, who shot David Fincher's THE GAME (and the upcoming ZODIAC) as well a Gus Van Sant's notorious ""death trilogy"" of ELEPHANT, GERRY and LAST DAYS.  Here he provides some stunningly invasive long shots of Nicole Kidman (particularly one two minute shot as she sits at the symphony hall with music cascading around her) and of Danny Huston (oh, the anguish in his eyes as Savides captures him through the huge window of the townhouse) who plays Kidman's boyfriend, Joseph.All the actors were good, even little Cameron Bright, whom I had given up on after watching his intolerable spooky act in a similar film, GODSEND with Robert De Niro.  I wouldn't want to be Cameron Bright, you know he's going to grow up to be seriously twisted after playing the GODSEND part and now this!Was I the only one to blink and think that the characters of Clifford and Clara (Peter Stormare and Anne Heche) were supposed to be the parents of the dead Sean?  They could have cleared it up with one line of dialogue; you got to love that Jean Claude Carriere, keeping things murky that don't have to be.  That's what gives BIRTH its European air of the opaque.  For example, what do any of the characters do--except for the tutor guy?  (And Arliss Howard we know is a doctor of some kind, right?)  Kidman has three or four exquisite business suits and a job we see her going to and a board room in which some of the biggest scenes happen, but the filmmakers must have thought, oh, nobody will care and we don't really know what she does.  She's fantastic and should have won the Oscar for this part, not that wretched HOURS mess.As for Lauren Bacall, was she supposed to be secretly in love with the mysterious Zoe Caldwell character?  Only time she perked up is when Caldwell swept into the room like a very regal miniature schnauzer, barking, ""Do you know who I am?""

But this woman, Anna (Nicole Kidman) is engaged to another man. The child (Cameron Bright) does not want Anna to marry this man (Danny Huston). So the conflict lies in whether or not the kid is indeed the former husband, and if so, what Anna is to do about it. The dead-love-one-reincarnated is a storyline that's been done before, but it's been done a lot more grippingly than this (What Dreams May Come and Fluke, for example).It's a slow-paced film with lots of semi-tension and zero comic relief. A main element lacking from this movie is the bond between Anna and her deceased husband. I think it was the right move to make him die at the beginning of the movie, but we should have some flashbacks of their relationship in order to establish their undying love and let the audience connect to it. Without this insight, he is just a name; a concept. We don't see him as a personality. What's more, the camera work in Birth becomes tediously face-focused. In other words, we get these 10-30 second zooms on single facial expressions--after a while, we get it--he's thoughtful, she's confused, etc.So what works positively for Birth? For one, we aren't sure who to root for. It's the type of film without black and white morals--instead, morality is questionable, leaving the audience fence-jumping in terms of right versus wrong.

885362,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B0007P0X9G,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[1, 2]","Reincarnation, the rebirth of the soul in a new body, heavily shades Buddhism where the actions of a being will reflect on how the soul transcends into the next life through a mental and moral self-purification process in order to try to reach nirvana.  This notion is thoroughly expanded through the artistic cinematic venture that can be experienced in Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter, ... and Spring (2003) by Ki-duk Kim, which takes place in South Korea.  In the Western world, reincarnation links with Christianity where Jesus Christ raised from the dead in the third day after having died on the cross, which has been depicted in several films such as The King of Kings (1927).  These religious concepts will with no doubt color the impression of Birth, which figuratively plays with the ideas from both Buddhism and Christianity.In the opening scene the audience gets to follow a jogger, whose identity remains a secret, as the individual has a hood covering the head.  The camera pursues the jogger from a high rear angle while moving along a snow-covered path.  Simultaneously a playfully angelic tune accompanies this short venture, which suggests that someone, maybe an angel, is watching over the jogger.  When the jogger enters a tunnel, he stops, places his hands on his knees while falling to the ground.  Consequently, the camera zooms out from the tunnel followed by a jump cut where an infant is undergoes a water birth.  All of these scenes suggest a cyclical pattern where death leads to birth, as the water birth scene offers additional symbolic value of rejuvenation.Two years later, Anna (Nicole Kidman) finds herself getting married to Joseph (Danny Huston), as she seems to have overcome the grief of loosing her husband.  However, a young boy appears unannounced at Anna's mother's birthday party and tells Anna that he is Sean, her late husband.  Initially, Anna waives it off as a cruel hoax, but when the boy begins to say things that only Sean could have known she stumbles backwards into an emotional state of confusion.  Bewildered Anna begins to ponder what if it really is Sean, as she slowly begins to regress into the grief she felt when Sean died.  However, she sidesteps the misery by beginning to embrace the 10-year old boy, as if he really was Sean, which opens a new can of worms in regards to pedophilia.At the moment when Anna begins to think about the possibility of reincarnation the audience will feel that Birth is taking a sudden turn for the worse, as it provides a very disturbing element into the story.  Instead of a blissful reincarnation the audience gets to experience a taboo concept of love between two lovers, as one is a child and the other an adult.  None of the characters with, the exception of Joseph, step up to the plate and tells Anna that her interaction with the boy is wrong, but it is too late when she has fallen under the spell of the boy.  This is when others begin to voice their opinion, which causes some awkwardness in the story.  Furthermore, no one questions the boy's sanity, or how he could possible know what he knows, and when they do it only displays a feeble attempt by someone within the family.  It is even hard for the audience to questions the boy, as several visual cues and symbols that have been presented in the film suggest that reincarnation has taken place.There is strong potential in the story through the disturbing element, but the director Jonathan Glazer's use of strong visual symbols and signs only serves the purpose of misdirection, which develops a fraudulent and deceitful atmosphere in the film.  The misdirection of the symbolism overweighs the few occasions when the film provides some factual scenes that could cue the audience in the right direction.  Yet, these could also be misleading, as one does not know what could be true in the sense of what one sees.  Maybe, Glazer intended to generate the same hypnotic feeling that Anna experienced through the little boy and what he said, but this hypothesis does not provide any strength to how the audience will experience the film.The camera work and the cast's performance generate a strong sense of disconnection, which actually helps the films atmosphere as it provides the feeling that there is something wrong with the whole situation.  Nicole Kidman's performance is radiantly strong, as she displays the bewildering power of grief, love, and disconnection in a genuine manner.  However, Kidman's performance does not save the film, as the visual symbolism merely functions as a tool of misdirection and it truly hurts the quality of the film through the overt use of the visual allegory.  This misdirection, as mentioned before, leaves the audience with two different notions.  One, the feeling of deceit, and two, the feeling that one should not underestimate the power of what one observes.  In the end, the audience will have experienced a disturbing tale, which could have been better developed, yet it offers some interesting contemplation.",3,Visually Deceptive Tale of Reincarnation...,1114819200,"04 30, 2005",2005,5012,"['Reincarnation', 'rebirth', 'soul', 'new', 'body', 'heavily', 'Buddhism', 'where', 'actions', 'being', 'will', 'reflect', 'how', 'soul', 'next', 'life', 'mental', 'moral', 'self-purification', 'process', 'order', 'try', 'reach', 'nirvana', 'notion', 'thoroughly', 'expanded', 'artistic', 'cinematic', 'venture', 'can', 'be', 'experienced', 'Spring', 'Summer', 'Fall', 'Winter', 'Spring', '2003', 'Ki-duk', 'Kim', 'place', 'South', 'Korea', 'Western', 'world', 'reincarnation', 'links', 'Christianity', 'where', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'raised', 'dead', 'third', 'day', 'having', 'died', 'cross', 'been', 'depicted', 'several', 'films', 'such', 'King', 'Kings', '1927', 'religious', 'concepts', 'will', 'doubt', 'impression', 'Birth', 'figuratively', 'ideas', 'Buddhism', 'Christianity.In', 'opening', 'scene', 'audience', 'follow', 'jogger', 'identity', 'secret', 'individual', 'hood', 'covering', 'head', 'camera', 'jogger', 'high', 'rear', 'angle', 'moving', 'along', 'snow-covered', 'path', 'Simultaneously', 'playfully', 'angelic', 'tune', 'accompanies', 'short', 'venture', 'someone', 'maybe', 'angel', 'watching', 'jogger', 'When', 'jogger', 'tunnel', 'hands', 'knees', 'falling', 'ground', 'Consequently', 'camera', 'out', 'tunnel', 'followed', 'jump', 'cut', 'where', 'infant', 'undergoes', 'water', 'birth', 'scenes', 'suggest', 'cyclical', 'pattern', 'where', 'death', 'birth', 'water', 'birth', 'scene', 'additional', 'symbolic', 'value', 'rejuvenation.Two', 'years', 'later', 'Anna', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'getting', 'married', 'Joseph', 'Danny', 'Huston', 'have', 'overcome', 'grief', 'loosing', 'husband', 'However', 'young', 'boy', 'unannounced', 'Anna', 'mother', 'birthday', 'party', 'tells', 'Anna', 'Sean', 'late', 'husband', 'Initially', 'Anna', 'off', 'cruel', 'hoax', 'when', 'boy', 'say', 'things', 'only', 'Sean', 'could', 'have', 'known', 'backwards', 'emotional', 'state', 'confusion', 'Bewildered', 'Anna', 'ponder', 'what', 'really', 'Sean', 'slowly', 'regress', 'grief', 'felt', 'when', 'Sean', 'died', 'However', 'misery', 'beginning', 'embrace', '10-year', 'old', 'boy', 'really', 'was', 'Sean', 'new', 'can', 'worms', 'regards', 'pedophilia.At', 'moment', 'when', 'Anna', 'think', 'possibility', 'reincarnation', 'audience', 'will', 'feel', 'Birth', 'taking', 'sudden', 'turn', 'worse', 'very', 'disturbing', 'element', 'story', 'Instead', 'blissful', 'reincarnation', 'audience', 'experience', 'taboo', 'concept', 'love', 'two', 'lovers', 'one', 'child', 'other', 'adult', 'None', 'characters', 'exception', 'Joseph', 'step', 'up', 'plate', 'tells', 'Anna', 'interaction', 'boy', 'wrong', 'too', 'late', 'when', 'fallen', 'spell', 'boy', 'when', 'others', 'begin', 'voice', 'opinion', 'awkwardness', 'story', 'Furthermore', 'one', 'questions', 'boy', 'sanity', 'how', 'could', 'possible', 'know', 'what', 'when', 'do', 'only', 'feeble', 'attempt', 'someone', 'family', 'even', 'hard', 'audience', 'questions', 'boy', 'several', 'visual', 'cues', 'symbols', 'have', 'been', 'presented', 'film', 'suggest', 'reincarnation', 'taken', 'place.There', 'strong', 'potential', 'story', 'disturbing', 'element', 'director', 'Jonathan', 'Glazer', 'use', 'strong', 'visual', 'symbols', 'signs', 'only', 'purpose', 'misdirection', 'fraudulent', 'deceitful', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'misdirection', 'symbolism', 'few', 'occasions', 'when', 'film', 'factual', 'scenes', 'could', 'cue', 'audience', 'right', 'direction', 'could', 'also', 'be', 'misleading', 'one', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'true', 'sense', 'what', 'one', 'Maybe', 'Glazer', 'intended', 'generate', 'same', 'hypnotic', 'feeling', 'Anna', 'experienced', 'little', 'boy', 'what', 'said', 'hypothesis', 'not', 'provide', 'strength', 'how', 'audience', 'will', 'experience', 'film.The', 'camera', 'work', 'cast', 'performance', 'generate', 'strong', 'sense', 'disconnection', 'actually', 'films', 'atmosphere', 'feeling', 'something', 'wrong', 'whole', 'situation', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'performance', 'radiantly', 'strong', 'bewildering', 'power', 'grief', 'love', 'disconnection', 'genuine', 'manner', 'However', 'Kidman', 'performance', 'not', 'save', 'film', 'visual', 'symbolism', 'merely', 'functions', 'tool', 'misdirection', 'truly', 'quality', 'film', 'overt', 'use', 'visual', 'allegory', 'misdirection', 'mentioned', 'audience', 'two', 'different', 'notions', 'One', 'feeling', 'deceit', 'two', 'feeling', 'one', 'should', 'not', 'underestimate', 'power', 'what', 'one', 'end', 'audience', 'will', 'have', 'experienced', 'disturbing', 'tale', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'developed', 'interesting', 'contemplation']",N/A

885365,A3AOKQCH0YBZDS,B0007P0X9G,L. A. Vitale,"[3, 5]","I was really drawn to the storyline of this movie and thought it sounded pretty original...... a young woman (played by Nicole Kidman) is widowed and grieves for the loss of the husband she loved so dearly. Just as she is ready to move on with her life and becomes engaged, a 10 year old boy crashes her engagement party and flat out tells her that he is her dead husband, Sean, reincarnated.Kidman's character brushes the incident off as a sick prank and everyone else brushes it off too. That is until the boy keeps right on harrassing Kidman's character saying that he is her dead husband, Sean. Kidman's character and that of fiance's character track down the boy's parents and tell them to stop his antics.Finally Kidman's character begins to believe the boy may in fact be the reincarnated version of her deceased hubby, when the 10 year old boy manages to come up with a few convincing facts..... However, I didn't find all of what he said or didn't say to be convincing enough to throw away her entire life for him.Kidman's character wants so badly for this boy may to be her deceased husband reincarnated that she begins entertaining the boy's every whim. Like having him stay overnight at her home, taking baths with him, spending more time with him after school, etc. Kidman's character starts neglecting her fiance and others in her life because she is preoccupied with this 10 year old boy.You can't help but wonder throughout the movie if this is a cruel practical joke being played on Kidman's character or if in fact this boy is really the reincarnated version of her husband or simply mentally ill. We eventually find out that the boy isn't Kidman's character's deceased husband through a series of events. However, we never truly discovered why he pretended to be her deceased husband and how he knew so much about her former husband and their life together.",2,"Disappointing movie, both acting and plot wise.....",1152144000,"07 6, 2006",2006,1876,"['was', 'really', 'drawn', 'storyline', 'movie', 'thought', 'sounded', 'pretty', 'original', 'young', 'woman', 'played', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'widowed', 'grieves', 'loss', 'husband', 'loved', 'so', 'dearly', 'Just', 'ready', 'move', 'life', 'becomes', 'engaged', '10', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'engagement', 'party', 'flat', 'out', 'dead', 'husband', 'Sean', 'reincarnated.Kidman', 'character', 'incident', 'off', 'sick', 'prank', 'everyone', 'else', 'off', 'too', 'boy', 'keeps', 'right', 'harrassing', 'Kidman', 'character', 'saying', 'dead', 'husband', 'Sean', 'Kidman', 'character', 'fiance', 'character', 'track', 'down', 'boy', 'parents', 'tell', 'stop', 'antics.Finally', 'Kidman', 'character', 'believe', 'boy', 'may', 'fact', 'be', 'reincarnated', 'version', 'deceased', 'hubby', 'when', '10', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'come', 'up', 'few', 'convincing', 'facts', '..', 'However', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'what', 'said', 'did', ""n't"", 'say', 'be', 'convincing', 'enough', 'throw', 'away', 'entire', 'life', 'him.Kidman', 'character', 'so', 'badly', 'boy', 'may', 'be', 'deceased', 'husband', 'reincarnated', 'entertaining', 'boy', 'whim', 'having', 'stay', 'overnight', 'home', 'taking', 'baths', 'spending', 'more', 'time', 'school', 'etc', 'Kidman', 'character', 'neglecting', 'fiance', 'others', 'life', 'preoccupied', '10', 'year', 'old', 'boy.You', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'movie', 'cruel', 'practical', 'joke', 'being', 'played', 'Kidman', 'character', 'fact', 'boy', 'really', 'reincarnated', 'version', 'husband', 'simply', 'mentally', 'ill.', 'eventually', 'find', 'out', 'boy', ""n't"", 'Kidman', 'character', 'deceased', 'husband', 'series', 'events', 'However', 'never', 'truly', 'discovered', 'why', 'pretended', 'be', 'deceased', 'husband', 'how', 'knew', 'so', 'much', 'former', 'husband', 'life', 'together']",N/A
885366,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0007P0X9G,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[80, 105]","Ten years ago a man named Sean, who did not believe in reincarnation died and a baby boy was born, both in New York City.  The man was married, and on the day that his widow is celebrating her engagement to another man, the boy who shows up.  He informs the woman that he is Sean, and that she cannot remarry because she is still his wife.""Birth"" is a look at reincarnation that takes a different tack from other films where an old soul is in a new body.  First of all, director Jonathan Glazer's film is purposefully vague on the rules of the game.  At one point the woman, Anna (Nicole Kidman), does what anybody would do confronted by such circumstances.  She asks the young boy (Cameron Bright) a test question about somebody she once told her husband about.  Young Sean admits that he does not know the name, but, he says with eerie confidence, he will know the person when he sees them.This is a film that wants to have it both ways in a couple of key regards.  First, it wants both those who believe and those who are skeptical to find ample evidence to support their perspective.  Of course, this is important to such a film, because keeping the ambiguity and doubt going as long as possible is important.  Second, young Sean says things that speak to wisdom beyond his years one moment, and then he is playing on a swing like a 10-year-old the next.  This relates to the first point, because every time he provides another private detail of Sean and Anna's life together we are inclined to believe, and when he acts like a petulant child, we are forced to reconsider.Glazer hides the key to his mystery in plain sight.  Before young Sean and Anna meet at her birthday party, we witness a nervous Clara (Anne Heche), who comes up with an excuse not to go upstairs.  Instead, she runs out of the building, goes off into a wooded area, and buries the present she has bought.  Then she buys a substitute and takes it upstairs.  Clara and her husband, Clifford (Peter Stormare), were friends of Sean and Anna, so what they think about the young boy matters.  But then everybody in Anna's family has an opinion about young Sean.  Her imperial mother, Eleanor (Lauren Bacall), sees the boy as a threat, while her sister, Laura (Alison Elliot), makes it clear she will not believe any of this nonsense.  But Laura's husband, Bob (Arliss Howard), does not know what to think.  These are people from the upper class, so dealing with something this messy is beyond their competence.  No wonder that Anna's fianc&eacute;, Joseph (Danny Huston), is the one who loses patience with what is happening.The formal and sometimes stilted dialogue of the script reminded me of Woody Allen's ""Interiors,"" which, of course, is just the sincerest form of flattery with regards to the cinematic work of Ingmar Bergman.  That is why one of my first thoughts while watching ""Birth"" last night was that it was nice to watch a European film without subtitles.  There was just something so Continental about this film, which probably has to be with Jean-Claude Carri&egrave;re being one of the screenwriters, and I have no doubt that a lot of people will not be accessible to this film because of the sheer weight that Glazer gives the dialogue.  This is underscored by the film's most transcendent moment, where the camera stays on a close up of Anna's face for several minutes while she is at a concert, as she becomes a believer.But the attraction here is the psychology of the characters, whose lives are being shattered by just the possibility that this is all true.  ""Birth"" might not make it clear how much Anna was devastated by Sean's death.  We know that it took years for her to agree to go out on a date and years for her to accept his proposal, but it is not until we realize how desperately she wants it to be Sean that we understand his character.  One of the reasons I found ""Birth"" compelling was that I could relate to the motivations of the main characters.  Whatever problems the film might have with dialogue and plot, the characters ring true for me on a most basic level.It dawned on me when watching this film is that Nicole Kidman is one of those actresses who looks most beautiful when she is smiling through her tears, and she has a couple of opportunities to do that in this film.  I wish they had given both Bacall and Zoe Caldwell more to do in this movie, but ""Birth"" really does come down to Anna and young Sean.  Everybody else can make up their mind as quickly or on whatever basis they want to, but the only judgment that matters is that of Anna (and of one other character, as I suspected).Bright's performance reminds me of that of Keisha Castle-Hughes in ""Whale Rider,"" a movie I had seen once before she was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress.  I applauded the nomination based on my fond memories of the film and the scene where Pai gives her speech on the meaning of her name and her grandfather.  But when I watched ""Whale Rider"" I was surprised at how often Castle-Hughes did nothing but look intently at someone, while the audience invested her character with depth and emotional coloring.  The same applies to Bright, who repeatedly looks at the adults around him with a slightly tilted head and intense gaze, which also fills in the gaps in his character.  Again, this will be a flaw for many viewers, who are not going to be willing to participate that much in making the film work.",4,What if you husband was reincarnated as a 10 year old

885367,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B0007P0X9G,Lawyeraau,"[23, 27]","This is a film that from the beginning lets you think that it is something that it is not. Still, it has its moments, however faintly creepy they may be. The film starts off with the death of a man while jogging in Central Park in New York City and the birth of a boy. Both events occurred ten years prior. They are juxtaposed together, giving rise to an inference that these two events are pivotal and interrelated, They are, but not, perhaps, in the way that one might be led to believe during the course of this film.Anna (Nicole Kidman) is a stunning woman, whose husband, Sean, died  ten years before while he was out jogging in Central Park. She has been mourning all this time but has been wooed for the past several years by a kindly and persistent suitor named Joseph (Danny Huston).  They are finally  celebrating their engagement, when a ten year old boy (Cameron Bright) appears on their horizon with the startling announcement that he is her long dead husband, Sean. At first, his announcement is treated as a joke, and the boy is sent on his way. The boy's father is a tutor in the building where Anna lives.The boy persists with his assertions, and Anne's fiance Joseph confronts the father about his son's declaration. The father is surprised and tries to get the boy to promise to stay away. Even Anna's own pleas do not persuade the boy to cease and desist.  Finally, the boy's parents agree to let Anna's brother-in-law, Bob (Arliss Howard), who is a medical doctor, question the boy. To his shock and surprise, the boy knows some details that only Anna's husband, Sean, and Anna could have known.  His wife, Anna's sister, Laura (Alison Elliot), is incredulous, as is Anna's mother, Eleanor (Lauren Bacall).The boy persists in his assertions that he is Anna's husband, Sean. Coupled with the intimate details that he gives out with perfect timing, Anna now believes what her heart tells her must be true, although her head tells her that it cannot be. Even Sean's best friend, Clifford (Peter Stormare), now believes the boy. It is Clifford's wife, Clara (Anne Heche), however, who holds the key to the truth, not only as to the boy, but to ending Anna's grieving.The film is shot in somber, neutral, muted colors with subdued lighting. This  suits and underscores the somewhat understated, restrained mood and dialogue of the film. It is as if everyone were holding back something. When someone lets go, as Joseph does in a moment of insanity and engages in what some would term child abuse but what others might say was well-deserved retribution, it seems even more violent that it actually is. Anna is clearly still grieving for her long dead husband, although she is somewhat in denial, or she would not be so taken in by the assertions of this child to the point that she allows the boy to take off his clothes and get in the tub with her where she is already naked. That is definitely a creepy, unsettling, uncomfortable scene.Some of the film is implausible. The fact that the parents allow their ten year old son, who is claiming out of the clear blue to be Anna's husband, stay overnight with Anna in her apartment is simply unbelievable. Moreover, when all is said and done, and the issue of whether the boy is or is not Sean is resolved,  the film leaves the biggest conundrum of all, that of the boy himself, unresolved. It is interesting that nowhere in the film is there a name referenced to the boy, other than that of Sean.This film has its pluses, but it is overwhelmed by its minuses. Quite frankly, the handling of the situation, involving the purported reincarnation of Sean, by all these otherwise intelligent, seemingly educated people, is moronic and simply not believable. So, the problem with the film is not inherent in the acting or direction, both of which are good, but in the screenplay itself.  The faintly creepy scenes with Anna and the boy are somewhat distasteful. In the end, the audience feels as if it were hoodwinked, as the motivation for what transpired is never satisfactorily explained or alluded to in a way that makes sense, making for an ultimately unsatisfying film experience that is neither here nor there.",3,A GIANT RED HERRING...,1126051200,"09 7, 2005",2005,4175,"['film', 'beginning', 'lets', 'think', 'something', 'not', 'Still', 'moments', 'however', 'faintly', 'creepy', 'may', 'be', 'film', 'death', 'man', 'jogging', 'Central', 'Park', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'birth', 'boy', 'events', 'occurred', 'ten', 'years', 'prior', 'are', 'juxtaposed', 'together', 'giving', 'rise', 'inference', 'two', 'events', 'are', 'pivotal', 'interrelated', 'are', 'not', 'perhaps', 'way', 'one', 'might', 'be', 'led', 'believe', 'course', 'film.Anna', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'stunning', 'woman', 'husband', 'Sean', 'died', 'ten', 'years', 'before', 'was', 'out', 'jogging', 'Central', 'Park', 'been', 'mourning', 'time', 'been', 'wooed', 'past', 'several', 'years', 'kindly', 'persistent', 'suitor', 'named', 'Joseph', 'Danny', 'Huston', 'are', 'finally', 'celebrating', 'engagement', 'when', 'ten', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'Cameron', 'Bright', 'horizon', 'startling', 'announcement', 'long', 'dead', 'husband', 'Sean', 'first', 'announcement', 'treated', 'joke', 'boy', 'sent', 'way', 'boy', 'father', 'tutor', 'building', 'where', 'Anna', 'boy', 'persists', 'assertions', 'Anne', 'fiance', 'Joseph', 'father', 'son', 'declaration', 'father', 'surprised', 'tries', 'get', 'boy', 'promise', 'stay', 'away', 'Even', 'Anna', 'own', 'pleas', 'do', 'not', 'persuade', 'boy', 'cease', 'desist', 'Finally', 'boy', 'parents', 'agree', 'let', 'Anna', 'brother-in-law', 'Bob', 'Arliss', 'Howard', 'who', 'medical', 'doctor', 'question', 'boy', 'shock', 'surprise', 'boy', 'details', 'only', 'Anna', 'husband', 'Sean', 'Anna', 'could', 'have', 'known', 'wife', 'Anna', 'sister', 'Laura', 'Alison', 'Elliot', 'incredulous', 'Anna', 'mother', 'Eleanor', 'Lauren', 'Bacall', '.The', 'boy', 'persists', 'assertions', 'Anna', 'husband', 'Sean', 'Coupled', 'intimate', 'details', 'out', 'perfect', 'timing', 'Anna', 'now', 'what', 'heart', 'must', 'be', 'true', 'head', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'Even', 'Sean', 'best', 'friend', 'Clifford', 'Peter', 'Stormare', 'now', 'boy', 'Clifford', 'wife', 'Clara', 'Anne', 'Heche', 'however', 'who', 'key', 'truth', 'not', 'only', 'boy', 'ending', 'Anna', 'grieving.The', 'film', 'shot', 'somber', 'neutral', 'muted', 'colors', 'subdued', 'lighting', 'suits', 'somewhat', 'understated', 'restrained', 'mood', 'dialogue', 'film', 'everyone', 'were', 'holding', 'back', 'something', 'When', 'someone', 'go', 'Joseph', 'moment', 'insanity', 'what', 'would', 'term', 'child', 'abuse', 'what', 'others', 'might', 'say', 'was', 'well-deserved', 'retribution', 'even', 'more', 'violent', 'actually', 'Anna', 'clearly', 'still', 'grieving', 'long', 'dead', 'husband', 'somewhat', 'denial', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'so', 'taken', 'assertions', 'child', 'point', 'boy', 'take', 'off', 'clothes', 'get', 'tub', 'where', 'already', 'naked', 'definitely', 'creepy', 'unsettling', 'uncomfortable', 'scene.Some', 'film', 'implausible', 'fact', 'parents', 'allow', 'ten', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'who', 'claiming', 'clear', 'blue', 'be', 'Anna', 'husband', 'stay', 'overnight', 'Anna', 'apartment', 'simply', 'unbelievable', 'Moreover', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'issue', 'boy', 'not', 'Sean', 'resolved', 'film', 'biggest', 'conundrum', 'boy', 'unresolved', 'interesting', 'nowhere', 'film', 'there', 'name', 'referenced', 'boy', 'other', 'Sean.This', 'film', 'pluses', 'overwhelmed', 'minuses', 'Quite', 'frankly', 'handling', 'situation', 'involving', 'purported', 'reincarnation', 'Sean', 'otherwise', 'intelligent', 'seemingly', 'educated', 'people', 'moronic', 'simply', 'not', 'believable', 'So', 'problem', 'film', 'not', 'inherent', 'acting', 'direction', 'are', 'good', 'screenplay', 'faintly', 'creepy', 'scenes', 'Anna', 'boy', 'are', 'somewhat', 'distasteful', 'end', 'audience', 'feels', 'were', 'hoodwinked', 'motivation', 'what', 'transpired', 'never', 'satisfactorily', 'explained', 'alluded', 'way', 'sense', 'making', 'ultimately', 'unsatisfying', 'film', 'experience', 'here', 'there']",N/A
885368,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B0007P0X9G,Lee Armstrong,"[1, 2]","As one of those who think Nicole Kidman is both a great actress & great movie star, seeing ""Birth"" was essential viewing!  Kidman gives an excellent nuanced performance, conflicted & confused.  Director Jonathan Glazer gives her full reign with the camera, focusing for a very long moment in screen time as her face twitches with reaction & emotion as we observe her, even as she is an audience observing a performance.  ""Birth"" is a very bold production in the chances it takes.  It earned Kidman a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress in a drama, even as she previously had an Oscar nomination for Moulin Rouge and her Oscar win for ""The Hours.""  Sean-Cameron Bright as the little boy who may or may not actually be the reincarnation of her late husband appears not to have left his ""creepyness"" behind from his role in ""Godsend.""  This is a directorial flaw that probably elevates Glazer's other film ""Sexy Beast"" above this in effectiveness.  Danny Huston who will be seen in ""The Constant Gardner"" and was in ""The Aviator"" plays Joseph, Kidman's fiancee.  Huston reaches a number of levels from dismissing the boy's claim to being worried to blowing up like an incendiary device in an emotional pressure cooker.  Lauren Bacall previously starred with Kidman in ""Dogville,"" another unusual stylish piece of cinema, and had her sole Oscar nomination for ""The Mirror With Two Faces"" with Barbra Streisand in 1996.  There are not a lot of levels here that Bacall is given to play, but she delivers with steel-eyed determination.  Anne Heche as Clara gives a good performance as the sister-in-law whose clandestine affair with Kidman's dead husband becomes part of the criteria of whether the boy is actually a bona fide reincarnation.  Hers is an excellent edgy performance.As with others, I groaned, ""Oh, no!"" when the boy took off his clothes & hopped into the tub with Kidman.  Quite frankly, I thought this would have been a substantially better film if that scene had been cut.  Bright didn't have the sophistication to bring it off; so as an audience member I'm left to react to what I see -- a grown woman naked in a tub with a naked boy.  It did not work and ruined what the film had going for it.The long arty sequences such as the opening shot where the soon-to-be-dead husband runs endlessly in a snow-filled park bogged the film down to a standstill.  In the end, I think Kidman or Bacall fans will appreciate watching the film, but will fail to be mesmerized by it.

But it stars Nicole Kidman who's one of the most versatile actors in the business and it's a low-budget independent film targeted at the art-house market.The plot revolves around a young widow, Anna.  Her husband has been dead for ten years and she is about to remarry.  Her future husband, Danny Huston is deeply in love with her.  Lauren Bacall is cast as Anna's mother and everyone is New York Penthouse wealthy.  Suddenly, in the middle of the happy couple's joyous engagement party, a ten-year old boy appears.  Later, he returns, claiming to be the reincarnation of Anna's dead husband. Cameron Bright is cast in this role and he seems so adult that it's hard to believe he's only ten years old.From the very first scene I was hooked.  The script is tight, the setting perfect and the background classical music a perfect complement to the mysterious goings on.  Most of the characters are disbelieving.  And they are annoyed that Anna can't stop thinking that the young boy is really her former husband.  All the other characters are realists and honestly believe that the child is just making thing up.  But how does he know all the intimate details of Anna's former marriage?  And could it be Anne Heche, cast as a friend of Anna's with a secret of her own, who holds the key to the mystery?The film moves fast and there is not a wasted word or an extra scene.

The sensuality between Kidman and the boy is disturbing but not over done and the director has walked a very fine line there and done it well.  The often over-used backdrop of New York and Central Park is captured quite beautifully here and amost features as a character more than a backdrop which is a nice touch.

885374,A152C8GYY25HAH,B0007P0X9G,Matthew Horner,"[6, 7]","""Birth"" is perhaps too elegant for its own good. Much like 2003's ""The Dreamers"", it is a movie anachronistic to the sensibilities of the early 21st Century, a time when, at least on the surface, something either is or it isn't. Puzzles, enigmas and other shades of gray are out of fashion. It is also, at least for today's overly entertained audiences, painfully slow.The movie opens with a shot that lasts several minutes. A lone jogger runs through a path in snow-filled Central Park. In a tunnel, he suddenly stops and falls over dead.The movie leaps forward ten years. We learn that his name was Sean and that he was the husband of Anna [Nicole Kidman], who now lives with her wealthy and overbearing mother [Lauren Bacall]. Anna is finally about to remarry. Suddenly, a ten-year old boy [Cameron Bright] appears, claiming to be the reincarnation of Sean. The household is slowly thrown into turmoil, as the boy reveals more and more information that seemingly could only have come from Sean.The movie's atmosphere is greatly enhanced by a marvelous score by Alexandre Desplat, beautiful photography by Harris Savides, and yet another amazing performance by Kidman.This is not a horror story in the modern sense. It's about how civilized, privileged people behave when confronted by an event that is unexplainable and beyond their control. The movie is closely related to ones made long ago, such as 1961's ""The Innocents"", in which a mad governess convinces her young charges to see the ghost she thinks she sees. Or 1963's ""The Haunting"", in which a vulnerable young woman goes mad while visiting a house she decides is out to kill her. In ""Birth"", maybe the boy is the reincarnated Sean, maybe he's not.

885375,A1TJPMB7N776WS,B0007P0X9G,MICHAEL ACUNA,"[1, 4]","""Birth"" is a movie you want to like, based on the cast and the plotline, but can't seem to muster the enthusiasm based on the actual delivery of the material to do so. It stars Nicole Kidman as Anna and Lauren Bacall as her skeptical mother Eleanor and is directed by Jonathan Glazer (the fantastic ""Sexy Beast"") but unfortunately it doesn't add up to a hill of beans. It's turgid, slow, empty-headed and implausible.Anna (Kidman) is about to marry Joseph (an oily Danny Huston) ten years after losing her husband Sean, who may be gone but, as far as Anna is concerned, is long from forgotten. Along comes a 10 yr old kid who claims to be the reincarnation of Sean (an eloquent Cameron Bright) who throws Anna's life into a tailspin...to say the least.All of this drama on the surface would seem to make for a terrific movie, but director Glazer drops the ball dramatically and what happens on screen is dull, inept and coma inducing. We want to believe what is going on but can't...and then won't... based on how the subject is presented and how the story unfolds.Director Glazer is on a slippery slope here with the Reincarnation theme: does he follow it through to its logical conclusion? And if so, what do you do with a 35 year old woman (Kidman) and a 10 yr old boy (Bright). Or do you play it off as some kind of a con-job? Unfortunately Glazer and his screenwriter opt for something in between which takes the wind out of the sails of this movie: both in the arena of drama and that of plausibility. We can only suspend our disbelief for so long before we turn away from the proceedings and begin to scoff.I do like the physical production, though: all marble and neutral colors with young Sean adding color when he visits Anna with his bright blue nylon parka. The film is shot with very muted light as befits the subject.Reincarnation as a subject for movies has not been mined effectively within recent memory and so, as a subject, it is ripe for exploration.

885376,AA0Y6M1TKHNHN,B0007P0X9G,Michael Walter,"[7, 10]","Birth is consistently gothic. It is moody, sophisticated, and beautiful.Its central character is Anna, a widow. Ten years after her husband dies, she finds herself confronted by a ten-year-old boy who claims to be the reincarnation of her husband. As she's just about to re-marry, the timing is awkward.The film's characters seem guided by what Ayn Rand called ""a sense of life."" This sense of life is revealed by the characters' behavior and development. Their dialogue is direct, but often sparse. Their emotions are subdued, and often stay that way. Few, if any, make nice, and the film neither moralizes about nor makes apologies for this.Silence is one aspect of this sense of life. The restaurant sequence is an example. Anna and her mother, elegantly but conservatively dressed, are isolated in their booth. The tablecloth is spotless. The chatter of the restaurant's unseen other diners is in the background. The two women speak for a moment, and then eat, and that is all: what's not said is more important than what is.Anna and Clara are almost physical doubles, their pale, mask-like faces distinguished only by their different haircuts. Contrast the close-up of Anna's face during the concert sequence with the close-up of Clara's face when, as she stands before him at the apartment entry-way, she tells the boy her secret.Several of the characters are willing to go all the way with their ideas. They know what they want and what they are up against. They know what to do with an obsession. Their willingness to go all the way with their ideas results in sometimes extreme physical expression, such as the scene in which Anna kisses her fianc&eacute;'s hand.The film's eerie atmosphere complements the inner lives of its characters. The color scheme, contoured by shadows, emphasizes blacks, browns, autumnal tones. Colors and lighting are almost inseparable from the spaces they illuminate. The film's architectural structures create a sense of confinement. Its environments, whether they are offices, homes, parks, or restaurants, have an inseparable, seamless quality.The more we try to understand this world, the more we are fascinated by it. It doesn't go where we expect it to; it doesn't end the way we think it will.Birth is influenced by Rembrandt, Isak Dinesen, and Stanley Kubrick.It is a labyrinth, and we are pulled into it with exquisite care.",4,Gothic Throughout: Birth Triumphs,1139529600,"02 10, 2006",2006,2371,"['Birth', 'consistently', 'gothic', 'moody', 'sophisticated', 'beautiful.Its', 'central', 'character', 'Anna', 'widow', 'Ten', 'years', 'husband', 'dies', 'confronted', 'ten-year-old', 'boy', 'who', 'be', 'reincarnation', 'husband', 'just', 'about', 're-marry', 'timing', 'awkward.The', 'film', 'characters', 'seem', 'guided', 'what', 'Ayn', 'Rand', 'called', 'sense', 'life', 'sense', 'life', 'revealed', 'characters', 'behavior', 'development', 'dialogue', 'direct', 'often', 'sparse', 'emotions', 'are', 'subdued', 'often', 'stay', 'way', 'Few', 'make', 'nice', 'film', 'moralizes', 'apologies', 'this.Silence', 'one', 'aspect', 'sense', 'life', 'restaurant', 'sequence', 'example', 'Anna', 'mother', 'elegantly', 'conservatively', 'dressed', 'are', 'isolated', 'booth', 'tablecloth', 'spotless', 'chatter', 'restaurant', 'unseen', 'other', 'diners', 'background', 'two', 'women', 'speak', 'moment', 'then', 'eat', 'what', 'not', 'said', 'more', 'important', 'what', 'is.Anna', 'Clara', 'are', 'almost', 'physical', 'doubles', 'pale', 'mask-like', 'distinguished', 'only', 'different', 'haircuts', 'Contrast', 'close-up', 'Anna', 'face', 'concert', 'sequence', 'close-up', 'Clara', 'face', 'when', 'apartment', 'entry-way', 'boy', 'secret.Several', 'characters', 'are', 'willing', 'go', 'way', 'ideas', 'know', 'what', 'want', 'what', 'are', 'up', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'obsession', 'willingness', 'go', 'way', 'ideas', 'results', 'sometimes', 'extreme', 'physical', 'expression', 'such', 'scene', 'Anna', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'hand.The', 'film', 'eerie', 'atmosphere', 'inner', 'lives', 'characters', 'color', 'scheme', 'contoured', 'shadows', 'blacks', 'browns', 'autumnal', 'tones', 'Colors', 'lighting', 'are', 'almost', 'inseparable', 'spaces', 'illuminate', 'film', 'architectural', 'structures', 'create', 'sense', 'confinement', 'environments', 'are', 'offices', 'homes', 'parks', 'restaurants', 'have', 'inseparable', 'seamless', 'quality.The', 'more', 'try', 'understand', 'world', 'more', 'are', 'fascinated', ""n't"", 'go', 'where', 'expect', ""n't"", 'end', 'way', 'think', 'influenced', 'Rembrandt', 'Isak', 'Dinesen', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick.It', 'labyrinth', 'are', 'pulled', 'exquisite', 'care']",N/A

We see a woman -- Clara (Anne Heche) -- about to arrive at a party.  She is bearing a gift.  She tells her husband to go upstairs to the party without her.  She wants to get a ribbon for the gift.  A little puzzled, he does as she asks.  She sits still for some time.  We see that a young boy notices her.  After a while, she leaves the apartment building, hurries into Central Park and buries the gift she has brought.  The young boy follows her on this journey.  She then goes into a shop and buys a replacement gift.The next scene shows a party.  The woman we have watched does not appear to be here.Nor is she at this party.  This is the sleight-of-hand that fools the watcher and may even confuse some viewers even after they have seen the entire movie.This is a different party, later in time.Here is what we are not told:First, the extent of Anna's needfulness for her dead husband.  This needfulness accounts, mostly, for all her dubious behavior to come.  One measure of her needfulness is how blind she was to his true nature when he was alive.  Essentially, the man Anna loved never existed.  The real Sean was having an affair with Clara, the wife in a couple with whom both Sean and Anna were close.  The measure of Sean's disdain for Anna was part of how he proved to Clara how much more he loved her:  He gave Clara all the unopened love letters Anna had been writing to him.Consider this:  Here is Anna, married to Sean, still so much in bliss that she writes him love letters.  And ignores the fact that he does not respond to them (he cannot, because he does not open them).  And yet she persists.  One can imagine how smothered Sean is by all this.  One can almost see how Sean would turn to another woman.  What makes him despicable is that he gives those unopened letters to his lover.We are told none of this, though.  It is for us to deduce backwards when we get to almost the end of the movie.What we see, but don't understand, is Clara showing up at this party prepared to show all the love letters to Anna, proving to Anna her husband's unfaithfulness; then changing her mind and burning the letters in a shallow hole.We see the young boy Sean, whose father tutors a child in the same apartment building, leaving him downstairs where the doorman/concierge sort of watches out for him.  We see him watching this strangely behaving woman.  We see him, a bored ten year old, following Clara into the park.  But we are not allowed to see him dig up the box of letters Clara buries there.  Nor do we see him later at home opening each letter and identifying with the addressee of the same name, the Sean Anna is so in love with, that Sean feels that love, feels he is really Anna's Sean.  We don't see him brooding, his personality changing.But we do see Sean showing up (and to us it seems like the same evening) at this other party, asking to see Anna and telling her not to marry Joseph, announcing that he is Sean.Now there is nothing wrong with hiding all the important links from us, the viewers.  If we are to perceive this from Anna's viewpoint, then we must be as ignorant as she is.  So why do I call this cheating?  One little reason: Clara's burying of the letters instead of just dumping them into a trashcan makes no sense and only is done because the picture cannot work without its happening.  And one bigger reason: We are deceived into thinking that the two consecutive scenes are separated by mere minutes instead of mere weeks.  This illusion is not necessary to the telling of the story; and it is so convincing that it is almost impossible to later recall the sequence and disentangle it.From now on, we follow Anna as she (and we) are beset by more and more convincing evidence that the boy Sean is indeed the reincarnation of dead husband Sean.  Sean has learned the contents of those love letters, and the facade of Anna's and Sean's marriage better than any ten year old mastering fractions in his spare time.Nor is Anna alone in her growing belief in Sean.  Others who knew both of them are at least dubiously credulous.But here is the second cheat, and it is even more bothersome than the first: No one seems to really care.I mean here is this kid, claiming to be the reincarnation of this man -- a nuclear physicist by all appearances -- and seeming like he might be telling the truth.  And no one is sitting down with him and asking the obvious questions.""Sean, what was it like to be reincarnated?""  ""Sean, do you remember that time we picked up a couple of hookers and got plastered?""  ""My God, Sean, how can you stand being ten years old and having acne?""  ""Isn't it cool, getting to start over again and avoid all those mistakes you made?""Yes, there is a short scene in which an acquaintance asks some ""telling"" questions ... until the interview stops.What is wrong with these people?!  Why isn't a single one of them excited?Well, Anna is excited, but only at the prospect of having Sean back.  How he got back seems totally irrelevant.  (Of course, in Anna's case this is quite consistent with the kind of clueless existence she had already been living with Sean.)  But still, doesn't anyone (anyone!) want to know what it's like for an adult to be trapped in the body of a ten year old?  Not in this movie, it seems.Okay, so angst all over the place.  Anna is convinced.  Most people aren't.  The boy friend wants to beat the kid up and actually tries to do just this.  This is tedious enough when we don't know what is happening; another good reason to hide the truth from us.  This is the attempt to make us believe we are watching a Swedish movie in which no one does anything that a living human being would actually do in real life, but which works in surreal masterpieces and only uses up film time here.Here we are, sinking en masse into a morass (excuse me) of who are these people and why am I still part of their lives?  Is there an exit?  There is indeed.Clara (Sean's lover, remember?  Oh, that's right, you didn't know) grabs young Sean, asks him if he recognizes her, and when he doesn't, tells him who she is, i.e. his erstwhile lover -- which he would know if he were really the original Sean, which clearly he isn't.  She has figured out how he got the letters, etc, and reveals all both to him and us.Well, it is time for her to tell Anna the truth, but nope, that would be inconsistent with her character -- the smidgen of character we have been allowed to see.No, it is up to Sean to have his (second) identity crisis, return to Anna's apartment and take another bath (don't ask), this time without Anna in the tub with him, and now he tells her that he is not Sean after all; but he doesn't tell how he knows this (in addition to showing symptoms of multiple personality disease, young Sean also seems to have a great, though misguided, maturity).And this leads to the end.  Anna is first distraught, then angry, then remorseful.  This remorse is shown in the next scene in which she is on her knees in front of Joe, begging him to understand that she is not at fault for believing the ten year old kid was actually Sean and spurning Joe for this prepubescent dour child (I mean, after all, even if he were Sean, come on now, he's a child and in a new body and bad things happen even to good people, although a chance to get rich telling your story on Oprah doesn't seem that much of a bad thing, but giving up this man with whom she has supposedly fallen in love?!).  But wait a minute, this man she is pleading to, to forgive her and marry her, this is the same man that lifted this child off the ground, tossed him around a room, started to spank him, and heaven knows what else.  This is the man she wants?Well, remember the character of Anna.  She's nuts.  She never knew her first husband.  And she never let go of him either.  She never had any interest in the character of this young Sean.  She is probably the world's loneliest woman, certainly one of the world's most narcissistically obsessive.Oh, yes, Joe forgives her and says he will marry her.  And we see the wedding while removed from it.  And we see an ambiguous scene on a beach in which she may or may not be having a breakdown (or perhaps revealing one that occurred ages ago -- who knows?) and may or may not be receiving support from Joe.End of movie.Was it worth it?  More than not.  If you are going to get anything out of this movie, you need to see it from the second perspective, the perspective of the outsider who knows who the characters really are.  Four characters in this movie are true or interesting enough that one can learn from and appreciate them:  Anna, Joe, the child Sean, and the dead husband Sean, whom we can only infer from the story.  None of them are particularly likeable, though, especially in retrospect; but they can produce one hell of a conversation.See what you think.",4,A Movie That Only Appears To Be About Reincarnation --

The movie addresses the complex topic of reincarnation and does not give any resolute, pat answers - which is simply too overwhelming for most audiences (and many critics). The acting is first class, the drama tight and effective; most of all the story is told with patience and emphasis on the minutia of the human perspective in the face of mortality and the elusive nature of human existence. Reincarnation is explored but is not necessarily the reason d'etre of the story - the concept of eternal love is the pulse of much of the narrative here.The director is not afraid to allow the emotions of a character to build and develop... often the camera stays close on the face of the principals for extended periods...which is nice and reassuring; it allows us the comfort of knowing that we are on a journey with a guide who is not going to blow his load at the first opportunity.A watershed for Kidman's character is the Wagner scene (which seems to be getting some unwarranted derision from one prominent 'thumbs down' critic). It forms a striking contrast to the manic technique now commonplace; I must say it is nice to have the camera on one face instead of jumping, cutting, zooming, etc. all over the place. It allows the viewer time to think, reflect and absorb the deeper intentions of the narrative.I just want to say that the film opens with on a good note and closes with one of the most haunting visuals ever portrayed in cinema. For those of you who have seen this movie you know what I am talking about, right?

But the mood and the outcome are the most satisfying features of the film.  I like the fact that in a Hollywood film with good actors and good talent the production team was willing to forego a happy ending in favor of a kind of realism.But what realism?  What emotional truth is being conveyed here?  It's a kind of creepy story about a supposedly reincarnated lover (with a couple of very uncomfortable scenes involving a grown woman and a young boy who claims to be her husband and she winds up believing him).  Okay.

885382,A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ,B0007P0X9G,Nicholas Carroll,"[2, 7]","I anxiously looked forward to this film (as I do with any film about reincarnation) and saw it in theaters before it quickly disappeared. I was severely disappointed, as this film was very slow moving, darkly lit, and purposefully vague. All that adds up to one somber and moody film. I left the theater feeling very ""blah!"" and that's not how I like feeling when I walk out of a movie theater.Nicole Kidman's performance was outstanding in this film (despite her severe hair cut) and I thought she should have been nominated for the Best Actress Oscar (it is among her best performances I've ever seen). Her performance is the biggest reason why I may end up buying this film (I liked it that much). She plays Anna, a woman who is about to be married after finally getting over her husband's death over a decade ago. But when a 10 year old boy comes into her life claiming to be Sean, her dead husband, with convincing sincerity, her doubts melt away despite her friends and family's skepticism.The best scene in this film was the one where everyone is gathered to hear a musician rehearse the wedding march (which is the best version I ever heard of that overfamiliar piece of music). Its disturbing to see a fully grown man get into a fight with a 10 year old boy over a woman. Apparently, that boy was able to get under a few people's skin with his insistence of being the reincarnation of Sean.The bathtub scene between Nicole Kidman and the boy bordered on bad taste (I couldn't help but think of Mary Kay Latourneau--the teacher who fell in love and went to prison for her inappropriate relationship with one of her students). I did like Anna's proding of the boy as they ate ice cream. She asked him how he planned to take care of her. It was mildly funny, but because this movie is so slow moving and dark...it really does try your patience. By the end, we have reason to doubt the boy's claim due to Anne Heche's insistence that Sean had really loved her, not Anna. The ending leaves Anna completely heartbroken as she realizes that she made a serious mistake in the decision she chose.Since I've read over 20 books on reincarnation, I have seen a remarkable consistency about how reincarnation is supposed to work and how all of us can find out about our former existences and what we are here to do in our current lifetimes...but this film touches on none of those ideas. Its merely about a love that doesn't die after the death of a spouse...and asks if its possible for the love to continue through the rebirth of one person, despite the age gap. The film certainly could have been much better...the topic of reincarnation demands a serious undertaking.  Unfortunately, this film is not it. They left it purposefully vague, perhaps to initiate viewers to discuss it in film circles...but they forgot to make the kind of film that a broader audience would be interested in seeing. I saw it in an empty theater with only one other person, and this film didn't last a month in theaters. Anyone who decides to watch it on dvd will understand why it didn't do well in theaters. Its a shame, because the topic is worth a serious film and the performances of Nicole Kidman and the boy are worth watching.",3,Another disappointing reincarnation film,1113609600,"04 16, 2005",2005,3211,"['anxiously', 'looked', 'forward', 'film', 'do', 'film', 'reincarnation', 'saw', 'theaters', 'quickly', 'disappeared', 'was', 'severely', 'disappointed', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'slow', 'moving', 'darkly', 'lit', 'purposefully', 'vague', 'up', 'one', 'somber', 'moody', 'film', 'left', 'theater', 'feeling', 'very', 'blah', 'not', 'how', 'like', 'feeling', 'when', 'walk', 'movie', 'theater.Nicole', 'Kidman', 'performance', 'was', 'outstanding', 'film', 'severe', 'hair', 'cut', 'thought', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Oscar', 'best', 'performances', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'performance', 'biggest', 'reason', 'why', 'may', 'end', 'up', 'buying', 'film', 'liked', 'much', 'Anna', 'woman', 'who', 'be', 'married', 'finally', 'getting', 'husband', 'death', 'decade', 'ago', 'when', '10', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'life', 'claiming', 'be', 'Sean', 'dead', 'husband', 'convincing', 'sincerity', 'doubts', 'melt', 'away', 'friends', 'family', 'skepticism.The', 'best', 'scene', 'film', 'was', 'one', 'where', 'everyone', 'gathered', 'hear', 'musician', 'rehearse', 'wedding', 'march', 'best', 'version', 'ever', 'heard', 'overfamiliar', 'piece', 'music', 'disturbing', 'see', 'fully', 'grown', 'man', 'get', 'fight', '10', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'woman', 'Apparently', 'boy', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'few', 'people', 'skin', 'insistence', 'being', 'reincarnation', 'Sean.The', 'bathtub', 'scene', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'boy', 'bordered', 'bad', 'taste', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'Mary', 'Kay', 'Latourneau', 'teacher', 'who', 'fell', 'love', 'went', 'prison', 'inappropriate', 'relationship', 'one', 'students', 'did', 'Anna', 'proding', 'boy', 'ate', 'ice', 'cream', 'asked', 'how', 'planned', 'take', 'care', 'was', 'mildly', 'funny', 'movie', 'so', 'slow', 'moving', 'dark', 'really', 'try', 'patience', 'end', 'have', 'reason', 'doubt', 'boy', 'claim', 'due', 'Anne', 'Heche', 'insistence', 'Sean', 'had', 'really', 'loved', 'not', 'Anna', 'ending', 'leaves', 'Anna', 'completely', 'heartbroken', 'made', 'serious', 'mistake', 'decision', 'chose.Since', ""'ve"", 'read', '20', 'books', 'reincarnation', 'have', 'seen', 'remarkable', 'consistency', 'how', 'reincarnation', 'supposed', 'work', 'how', 'can', 'find', 'out', 'former', 'existences', 'what', 'are', 'here', 'do', 'current', 'lifetimes', 'film', 'touches', 'none', 'ideas', 'merely', 'love', ""n't"", 'die', 'death', 'spouse', 'possible', 'love', 'continue', 'rebirth', 'one', 'person', 'age', 'gap', 'film', 'certainly', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'topic', 'reincarnation', 'serious', 'undertaking', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'not', 'left', 'purposefully', 'vague', 'perhaps', 'initiate', 'viewers', 'discuss', 'film', 'circles', 'forgot', 'make', 'kind', 'film', 'broader', 'audience', 'would', 'be', 'interested', 'seeing', 'saw', 'empty', 'theater', 'only', 'one', 'other', 'person', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'last', 'month', 'theaters', 'Anyone', 'who', 'watch', 'dvd', 'will', 'understand', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'well', 'theaters', 'shame', 'topic', 'serious', 'film', 'performances', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'boy', 'are', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A

I kept waiting for it to get better but it never did.If you love Nicole Kidman, she is very beautiful in the movie (if you can stand watching her being in love with a ten year old). Other than that, I can't think of much else to say about it.

First off it helps if you are attracted to the idea of reincarnation. Adding to the mix the child/adult sexual issues makes this movie even more polarizing for the viewer. I personally found the themes mesmerizing which enabled me to take something away after the viewing experience.In short this is a thinking mans/womans film. If you are looking for bang em up shoot em up films this one is not for you. If you are looking for slip on bananas Jim Carrey like films, the same said. But if you are the person that is mindful of nuance while at the same time having a open minded spirituality, one that has a searching quality to it, then this film is definitely for you.It is unfortunate that this film caters to such a small audience but for those of us who identify with it know it is a blessing to have seen it.As a side note Kiddman and Bright are just about perfect in their acting. I was especially impressed with Bright who for his age has surpassed himself. Personally I thought he stoled the show which in this case was almost impossible to do because Nicole was so spot on.One of the best aspects to this film was what could be expressed without uttering a single word. What Kiddman could express without words was simply uncanny. You could almost literally feel the audience squirm in their seats as most people familiar with Hollywood style simply aren't used to this enough to have acquired such a refined taste.I too do not want to give anything away but if you have an intuition about seeing this movie by all means go.

I find Lauren Bacall irritating too.  And she definitely is way overrated to me.  With that out of the way, I must say that Nicole was really great in this movie, and I forget that I find her irritating.  Still don't like Lauren, though.Birth is underrated as a movie.  But, then it is for refined minds that transcend mundane concepts of what is quality and then perceives the extraordinary.  This is to say that the theme of reincarnation is treated with artistry and elegance and made to seem really believable.  Consider how much of the world depends on reincarnation when there are over 1 billion Buddhists and only, maybe 300 million Christians (not including Catholics, who are not Christians).  I am Christian, but I only have my faith to defend my religion.  I can only hope that I will be raised with Christ.  What if I need to be reincarnated . . . . ?  Additionally, the theme of young boy and older woman may make many people with personal moral issues they have to deal with very uncomfortable.  Our parent's religions or our idiosyncrasies can make us very intolerant of others before even thinking it through.  For myself, I had to get used to the bath scenes, but I was able to do it by just placing everything in the context of the story rather than my personal life or the perverts next door.  Then, we can see why Anna would be attracted to young Sean, and vice versa.Some, mostly males, found this movie painfully slow.  It is somber, mystical, intellectual, elegant, and artistic.  You will need to use your senses to enjoy it.  Merely using your eyes and ears is guaranteed to leave you dissatisfied.I was only upset that there is no commentary whatsoever on the DVD version that I saw.  This movie needs ""insight"" to be completely satisfying, but I'm giving it 5-stars anyway, just for the sheer beauty of the total package.Lastly, I think that young Sean really was the older Sean, but was confused by the loss of his lust for the lover.  Since we are considering the supernatural element of reincarnation, then why couldn't the dead husband come back cleansed of the burden of adultery in his next life?

But what surprises me, is that I had to come here to understand Birth. Maybe I wasn't attentive enough, but I failed to understand (or see) what I intended to : the child, was he or not (Sean)? I felt he was not, but does it really matter? Lots of people here saw as many things in this special movie. And why not? Do we look at a movie as a documentary or as a story that has many possible branches?There is beauty in this movie (nice atmosphere with the music, nice filming), as there is a lot of symbolism. I couldn't read all the reviews here (I'll be #182!) but has anybody seen the dining room with the vases of calla lillies standing near a green wall? As we are talking about life, death, coming back to life and as there is a pregnant woman in the room... Etc.:We see the same flowers as a symbol of purity in ancient paintings of the Virgin Mary... Quite interesting, there is a lot of visual symbolism in this movie. No 2D here, not a movie with gun fire and bombs. Something more.As for atmosphere... It made me remember several times of The Piano, or Portrait of a Lady or The Others. A kind of perpetual mystery and a specific need to stay wide awake or miss the point. Some movies need our attention, make us think and ... aren't they supposed to entertain us? I believe so.Does Kidman (that I like very much, she reminds me of the force that drived Bette Davis) has to cry in every movie? Even though she does it convincingly... But the scene at the opera is exquisite, an extraordinary proof of her emotional talents.I purchased this movie for her, for Bacall (who is not a bitchy character for a change) and for the story.So.

Kidman is a beautiful young widow, who lost her husband 10 years before.  Preferring to grieve in a comfortable past as constructed in her mind rather than move on, she has finally consented to marry a man about whom she was and is ambivalent.  The pace is slow, all the emotions and thoughts are below the surface, never fully explained though hinted at.Just at the moment that she appears ready to re-enter life, a strange boy appears, claiming that he is in fact her husband.  The boy knows too much for it to be a hoax, so Kidman decides to explore the phenomenon.  An array of characters re-enter her life, whose layers are peeled away slowly, though ambiguously.  It is like an exercise in introspection for her, though she has come to believe in the boy and his claim yet maintains her ignorance of certain crucial facts.  Finally, it is the boy who realizes that he can't be the dead husband and returns to his former life.  It ends with nothing explained, except for the parting emotions that erupt at Kidman's wedding.  This is subtle art that can result in many interpretations - spirit visitation, a spell, shared insanity, possession - that makes this titillating and fun, entering the viewers' imaginations if they are so inclined.The feeling is spooky and melancholy, with stunning consistency that cuts deeply.

885394,A2ZF1WW0Z0ZXQD,B0007P0X9G,Robert VerBruggen,"[3, 7]","""Birth""  is fascinating, but in a sick, sick kind of way. It never loses the audience's attention.To start with, the plot is extremely innovative. Main character Anna is set to marry a man named Joseph - 10 years after the death of her first husband, Sean. But a 10-year-old boy arrives on the scene, claiming to be a reincarnation of the dead husband. His name, indeed, is Sean.Sean seems to know intimate details about Anna that only the ""real"" Sean would know - where ""they"" met, the fact that they ""did it"" on Anna's brother's couch. He warns Anna not to marry Joseph. Slowly, Anna starts to believe, and fall in love with, him.Cameron Bright does an excellent job of playing the child, coming off as creepy beyond his years and yet innocent at times. He's clearly in the top tier of modern child actors.The movie's most controversial scene, of course, occurs when the young Sean gets in a bathtub with Anna. Yes, naked, though there is no nudity in the shots. Critics including Robert Ebert have called it ""care[ful] and tact[ful],"" but it is indeed rather gag-inducing. Such an act, regardless of the circumstances and the manner in which it's filmed, is hard to excuse unless followed by a prison sentence. The movie would be much better off without it.The other scenes are excellent, however. Anna and her rich family (they all seem to live under one roof, oddly) react realistically and with skepticism. As the plot develops and Anna contemplates a relationship with Sean, her relatives and fiancee react more seriously, and even with violence.These elements make the movie easily worth seeing, as it is thought-provoking and very disturbing. The script is fiction at its best.To the film's detriment, though, is the cinematography. Striving too hard for an ""artsy"" vibe, the movie's flow is interrupted by awkward pauses, soap opera-esque zooming on characters' staring expressions and a very odd final sequence.In the end, the characters come through realistically, and the plot winds down to a totally unexpected conclusion. But in the process of making the ending come out of nowhere, the producers didn't bother to check their facts from earlier in the flick. Any analysis would spoil the ending, but it leaves the audience confused.All in all, despite its flaws and the facts that don't line up, ""Birth"" is one of the better movies to come out this year.",4,"Good, but disgusting at times",1117324800,"05 29, 2005",2005,2369,"['Birth', 'fascinating', 'sick', 'sick', 'kind', 'way', 'never', 'audience', 'attention.To', 'start', 'plot', 'extremely', 'innovative', 'Main', 'character', 'Anna', 'set', 'marry', 'man', 'named', 'Joseph', '10', 'years', 'death', 'first', 'husband', 'Sean', '10-year-old', 'boy', 'scene', 'claiming', 'be', 'reincarnation', 'dead', 'husband', 'name', 'indeed', 'Sean.Sean', 'know', 'intimate', 'details', 'Anna', 'only', 'real', 'Sean', 'would', 'know', 'where', 'met', 'fact', 'did', 'Anna', 'brother', 'couch', 'Anna', 'not', 'marry', 'Joseph', 'Slowly', 'Anna', 'believe', 'fall', 'love', 'him.Cameron', 'Bright', 'excellent', 'job', 'playing', 'child', 'coming', 'off', 'creepy', 'years', 'yet', 'innocent', 'times', 'clearly', 'top', 'tier', 'modern', 'child', 'actors.The', 'movie', 'most', 'controversial', 'scene', 'course', 'when', 'young', 'Sean', 'bathtub', 'Anna', 'Yes', 'naked', 'nudity', 'shots', 'Critics', 'including', 'Robert', 'Ebert', 'have', 'called', 'care', '[', 'ful', ']', 'tact', '[', 'ful', ']', 'indeed', 'rather', 'gag-inducing', 'act', 'regardless', 'circumstances', 'manner', 'filmed', 'hard', 'excuse', 'followed', 'prison', 'sentence', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'off', 'it.The', 'other', 'scenes', 'are', 'excellent', 'however', 'Anna', 'rich', 'family', 'seem', 'live', 'one', 'roof', 'oddly', 'react', 'realistically', 'skepticism', 'plot', 'Anna', 'relationship', 'Sean', 'relatives', 'fiancee', 'react', 'more', 'seriously', 'even', 'violence.These', 'elements', 'make', 'movie', 'easily', 'worth', 'seeing', 'thought-provoking', 'very', 'disturbing', 'script', 'fiction', 'best.To', 'film', 'detriment', 'cinematography', 'Striving', 'too', 'hard', 'artsy', 'vibe', 'movie', 'flow', 'interrupted', 'awkward', 'pauses', 'soap', 'opera-esque', 'zooming', 'characters', 'staring', 'expressions', 'very', 'odd', 'final', 'sequence.In', 'end', 'characters', 'come', 'realistically', 'plot', 'down', 'totally', 'unexpected', 'conclusion', 'process', 'making', 'ending', 'come', 'nowhere', 'producers', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'check', 'facts', 'earlier', 'flick', 'analysis', 'would', 'spoil', 'ending', 'audience', 'confused.All', 'flaws', 'facts', 'do', ""n't"", 'line', 'up', 'Birth', 'one', 'better', 'movies', 'come', 'out', 'year']",N/A

And honestly I did read the plot and right away I knew this movie was going to be pretty strange. Yet I didn't think they would get too...ahem intimate as they did. I mean come on, I'm not a prude but people this is a ten year old boy, sitting naked in a bath with a much older woman. That was a very uncomfortable scene to me and I think they took it a little too far there. And I know there are plenty of other reviews that said the same thing about this scene and honestly it is just downright weird why they did this- why would they put a young boy in such a scene- that is a little twisted to me. They shouldn't have gone that far. And of course I was expecting the boy to come into her life of course and sit down and talk with her and they would speak to each other. But the movie seemed more interested in constantly pushing the sex card on them, trying to make the film very weird. I think they wanted people to find it uncomfortable, and I don't know why. I could not believe Nicole Kidman's character actually even considered being with him that was just disgusting. And how could she truly know if it was him? I mean the whole thing would have made any normal woman dismiss it and warn the boy never to speak to her on that again.Anyway though, there were other problems besides that.Like the movie I thought was very... well bleak. I was never blown away by the scenes, nor the words spoken- all it did was leave me cold and uncomfortable. This whole movie was cold, and the actors looked like they were cut from stone. There was hardly any fire in any of the actors, most of the time everyone was just staring at each other coldly. The whole ending was pretty weak and left nothing there at all. The one thing I relied on in this whole movie after awhile was some kind of answer, some kind of ending that would finally end this constant is he- is he not dilemma. But no. You get nothing. Which made the movie one of the worst I had ever seen, and I've seen plenty other worse films, but this one goes into that category too.Overall the story sounds interesting, but do not buy it. It could have been made better and less strange. But the plot is slow, weird and just not one most people would enjoy seeing.

In fact, it's quiet, creepy and brilliant, bursting with a strange kind of confidence that director co-writer/director Jonathan Glazer knows just what to do with this story, and does it.The opening scene immediately sets that tone - a beautiful shot of a man running through Central Park, in high winter, passing under one tunnel, then halfway through another before he collapses. We are then shown the birth of a boy, the title card of ten years later, and a shot of the woman, Anna (Nicole Kidman), touching a gravestone. She returns to the car and says to a man, ""okay."" She's just accepted his proposal for marriage.Not long after, the boy, Sean (Cameron Bright), appears at a birthday party in Anna's expensive apartment. It's a shot of giant birthday cake illuminating Anna's whole family as they see the boy for the first time. Sean pulls Anna aside. ""It's me, Sean,"" he says. ""Your husband.""The movie presents this material like a short story would, with tact, detail and suspense. Anna is at first amused. Then curious. Then bothered. Then, in an extrodinary sequence that focuses on Kidman's face for a full two minutes at the symphony, deeply shaken. Bright plays the boy with a quiet certitude beyond his years, and besides, this Sean *knows* things. How? Is it Sean reincarnated? The movie provides one direct answer, but, piecing the details together, there are moments that answer doesn't address, least of all the opening sequence. ""Birth"" is comfortable enough to be unsettling and sad: There a lot of people aside from Anna who never got over the first Sean.Kidman, in the Mia Farrow haircut, is excellent as the dignified, intelligent but lonely Anna, who parades a polished facade until she encounters the boy. Glazer likes Kidman's face a lot, especially when her mouth isn't moving, and he frames it with spring colors and wood surfaces. Bright is convincing as Sean. Danny Huston plays Anna's fiancee, one of those burnished, proper, comfy men who aren't exactly rude so much as accustomed to things going according to plan. When they don't, his reaction is childish, but anguished in its own way. Lauren Bacall, Allison Elliot and Arliss Howard are members of Anna's disbelieving family, while Anne Heche, in a small but commanding performance, is the wild card, Anna's friend.The movie's real star is Glazer. His Euro treatment of this story - so different from his debut, ""Sexy Beast"" - is cool and professional, a throwback to Cassevetes, Kubrick, Polanski, Bogdanovich. The shots have been chosen with care, less for the plot than for the mood, which is more important with this subject matter. Glazer favors the long shot here, many of them, yet gets up close with Anna and Sean. The controverisal scene, where the two share a bathtub, is a little shocking but not tasteless. It wasn't entirely necessary, but it achieves its aim of taking this mystery - of Sean, of Anna's own feelings - seriously. Viewers owe ""Birth"" the same respect.",5,"A knockout: Chilling, subtle, visually sumptuous",1121126400,"07 12, 2005",2005,3224,"['Considering', 'story', 'budding', 'love', 'affair', 'fashionable', 'New', 'York', 'woman', '10-year-old', 'boy', 'who', 'be', 'dead', 'husband', 'Birth', 'could', 'not', 'afford', 'make', 'one', 'small', 'misstep', 'being', 'cheap', 'tawdry', 'remarkably', 'not', 'fact', 'quiet', 'creepy', 'brilliant', 'bursting', 'strange', 'kind', 'confidence', 'director', 'co-writer/director', 'Jonathan', 'Glazer', 'just', 'what', 'do', 'story', 'it.The', 'opening', 'scene', 'immediately', 'tone', 'beautiful', 'shot', 'man', 'running', 'Central', 'Park', 'high', 'winter', 'passing', 'one', 'tunnel', 'then', 'halfway', 'are', 'then', 'shown', 'birth', 'boy', 'title', 'card', 'ten', 'years', 'later', 'shot', 'woman', 'Anna', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'touching', 'gravestone', 'car', 'man', 'okay', 'just', 'accepted', 'proposal', 'marriage.Not', 'long', 'boy', 'Sean', 'Cameron', 'Bright', 'birthday', 'party', 'Anna', 'expensive', 'apartment', 'shot', 'giant', 'birthday', 'cake', 'illuminating', 'Anna', 'whole', 'family', 'see', 'boy', 'first', 'time', 'Sean', 'pulls', 'Anna', 'aside', 'Sean', 'husband', 'movie', 'material', 'short', 'story', 'would', 'tact', 'detail', 'suspense', 'Anna', 'first', 'amused', 'Then', 'curious', 'Then', 'bothered', 'Then', 'extrodinary', 'sequence', 'Kidman', 'face', 'full', 'two', 'minutes', 'symphony', 'deeply', 'shaken', 'Bright', 'boy', 'quiet', 'certitude', 'years', 'besides', 'Sean', '*knows*', 'things', 'How', 'Sean', 'reincarnated', 'movie', 'one', 'direct', 'answer', 'piecing', 'details', 'together', 'are', 'moments', 'answer', ""n't"", 'address', 'least', 'opening', 'sequence', 'Birth', 'comfortable', 'enough', 'be', 'unsettling', 'sad', 'lot', 'people', 'aside', 'Anna', 'who', 'never', 'got', 'first', 'Sean.Kidman', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'haircut', 'excellent', 'dignified', 'intelligent', 'lonely', 'Anna', 'who', 'polished', 'facade', 'boy', 'Glazer', 'Kidman', 'face', 'lot', 'especially', 'when', 'mouth', ""n't"", 'moving', 'spring', 'colors', 'wood', 'surfaces', 'Bright', 'convincing', 'Sean', 'Danny', 'Huston', 'Anna', 'fiancee', 'one', 'burnished', 'proper', 'comfy', 'men', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'rude', 'so', 'much', 'accustomed', 'things', 'going', 'according', 'plan', 'When', 'do', ""n't"", 'reaction', 'childish', 'anguished', 'own', 'way', 'Lauren', 'Bacall', 'Allison', 'Elliot', 'Arliss', 'Howard', 'are', 'members', 'Anna', 'disbelieving', 'family', 'Anne', 'Heche', 'small', 'commanding', 'performance', 'wild', 'card', 'Anna', 'friend.The', 'movie', 'real', 'star', 'Glazer', 'Euro', 'treatment', 'story', 'so', 'different', 'debut', 'Sexy', 'Beast', 'cool', 'professional', 'throwback', 'Cassevetes', 'Kubrick', 'Polanski', 'Bogdanovich', 'shots', 'have', 'been', 'chosen', 'care', 'less', 'plot', 'mood', 'more', 'important', 'subject', 'matter', 'Glazer', 'long', 'shot', 'here', 'many', 'yet', 'up', 'close', 'Anna', 'Sean', 'controverisal', 'scene', 'where', 'two', 'share', 'bathtub', 'little', 'shocking', 'not', 'tasteless', 'was', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'necessary', 'aim', 'taking', 'mystery', 'Sean', 'Anna', 'own', 'feelings', 'seriously', 'Viewers', 'owe', 'Birth', 'same', 'respect']",N/A

It's a great premise that promises for some unexpected twists and turns. However, the film fails to deliever and that's what makes ""Birth"" different from the rest. Instead of creating a thriller, Jonathan Glazer puts together a low-key, moody, and thought provoking melodrama. Watching ""Birth"" is also a treat. The cinemaphotography is pitch perfect.

885402,A3EAU736LWTDCE,B0007P0X9G,sinisterfiend666,"[3, 5]","As always, Nicole Kidman does a good job as an actress. She can shed light on any roll, in just about any movie and probably make it more interesting. As one person mentioned, if it wasn't for her, I don't think anyone would be watching this movie. Anyway, I thought it was an ""ok"" movie. I give it credit because it had one of the most original scripts I have seen in a long time. However, it is very flawed and far fetch. At times, not only can the film mange to be very strange but also very confusing. As one of the other reviewers said, this definitely reminded me of a Stanley Kubric type of film. Well, you have good actors/actresses, an awesome script, good sound, picture, and background music. So what's the problem? (1) For starters, it's a slow movie. Every movie uses what I call ""time killer"" scenes in them. Basically they are scenes I believe are there to stretch a movie to make it into a full length motion picture because the writer's script was too short. I must say, this movie has some of the dumbest ""time killer"" scenes I have ever scene. On many occasions you are stuck on a close up face shot of someone for several annoying minutes while they are not saying a word. It made me want to find my remote and FF (but I didn't)(2) The outcome of this movie was not well developed. In these types of movies, like ""hide in seek"" You have to either go in the ""supernatural"" direction, or go in the ""logical"" direct in explaining the events that took place during the movie. Without giving anything away, this movie does pick one of these directions. However, I think it picked the wrong one. Sorry for being vague, but lets just leave it at ANYONE could have wrote a better ending to this. (3) The move at time was very demented. Let me elaborate. I am a horror movie fan, usually when I say something is demented, that is a good thing, but it's not a good thing for this movie. This movie literally dabbles with the idea of pedophilia. I like movies as sick as they get, but to me, this was just a little too strange. I wasn't offended, but I definitely know my wife was taken back by it, and I could only imagine what my grandmother would say if she seen this movie.  Nicole Kidman = Michael Jackson? I'm really trying not to give too much of the movie away, but in order to reinforce my point, I feel the need to mention a couple scenes in the movie. SO stop reading if you don't want *spoilers* ----------------------------- Anyway, I thought It was very morbid when Nicole got naked with a 10 year old boy in a bathtub. I also thought it was morbid that she was kissing on this boy romantically in the movie. I found myself saying ""remember, this is supposed to be her husband"" but somehow, you just cannot get past the fact a grown adult is in a tub with a 10 year old boy. Like I said, I was a little surprised by these scenes. I certainly wasn't offended, being a person that comes from the horror/blood/gore genre, but I could definitely see a more conservative, mainstream ""typical Nicole kidman crowd"" being very offended by this. In some ways I give her credit for playing such a controversial roll. On the other hand, I ask myself why. She doesn't need the money.",3,An OK movie..........but........,1114128000,"04 22, 2005",2005,3194,"['always', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'good', 'job', 'actress', 'can', 'shed', 'light', 'roll', 'just', 'movie', 'probably', 'make', 'more', 'interesting', 'one', 'person', 'mentioned', 'was', ""n't"", 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'would', 'be', 'watching', 'movie', 'Anyway', 'thought', 'was', 'ok', 'movie', 'give', 'credit', 'had', 'one', 'most', 'original', 'scripts', 'have', 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'However', 'very', 'flawed', 'far', 'fetch', 'times', 'not', 'only', 'can', 'film', 'mange', 'be', 'very', 'strange', 'also', 'very', 'confusing', 'one', 'other', 'reviewers', 'said', 'definitely', 'reminded', 'Stanley', 'Kubric', 'type', 'film', 'Well', 'have', 'good', 'actors/actresses', 'awesome', 'script', 'good', 'sound', 'picture', 'background', 'music', 'what', 'problem', '1', 'starters', 'slow', 'movie', 'movie', 'what', 'call', 'time', 'killer', 'scenes', 'Basically', 'are', 'scenes', 'believe', 'are', 'there', 'stretch', 'movie', 'make', 'full', 'length', 'motion', 'picture', 'writer', 'script', 'was', 'too', 'short', 'must', 'say', 'movie', 'dumbest', 'time', 'killer', 'scenes', 'have', 'ever', 'scene', 'many', 'occasions', 'are', 'stuck', 'close', 'up', 'face', 'shot', 'someone', 'several', 'annoying', 'minutes', 'are', 'not', 'saying', 'word', 'made', 'want', 'find', 'remote', 'FF', 'did', ""n't"", '2', 'outcome', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'well', 'developed', 'types', 'movies', 'hide', 'seek', 'have', 'go', 'supernatural', 'direction', 'go', 'logical', 'direct', 'explaining', 'events', 'took', 'place', 'movie', 'giving', 'anything', 'away', 'movie', 'pick', 'one', 'directions', 'However', 'think', 'picked', 'wrong', 'one', 'Sorry', 'being', 'vague', 'just', 'leave', 'ANYONE', 'could', 'have', 'wrote', 'better', 'ending', '3', 'move', 'time', 'was', 'very', 'demented', 'Let', 'elaborate', 'am', 'horror', 'movie', 'fan', 'usually', 'when', 'say', 'something', 'demented', 'good', 'thing', 'not', 'good', 'thing', 'movie', 'movie', 'literally', 'idea', 'pedophilia', 'like', 'movies', 'as', 'sick', 'get', 'was', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'strange', 'was', ""n't"", 'offended', 'definitely', 'know', 'wife', 'was', 'taken', 'back', 'could', 'only', 'imagine', 'what', 'grandmother', 'would', 'say', 'seen', 'movie', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', '=', 'Michael', 'Jackson', ""'m"", 'really', 'trying', 'not', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'movie', 'away', 'order', 'reinforce', 'point', 'feel', 'need', 'mention', 'couple', 'scenes', 'movie', 'SO', 'stop', 'reading', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', '*spoilers*', 'Anyway', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'morbid', 'when', 'Nicole', 'got', 'naked', '10', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'bathtub', 'also', 'thought', 'was', 'morbid', 'was', 'kissing', 'boy', 'romantically', 'movie', 'found', 'saying', 'remember', 'supposed', 'be', 'husband', 'somehow', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'fact', 'grown', 'adult', 'tub', '10', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'said', 'was', 'little', 'surprised', 'scenes', 'certainly', 'was', ""n't"", 'offended', 'being', 'person', 'horror/blood/gore', 'genre', 'could', 'definitely', 'see', 'more', 'conservative', 'mainstream', 'typical', 'Nicole', 'kidman', 'crowd', 'being', 'very', 'offended', 'ways', 'give', 'credit', 'playing', 'controversial', 'roll', 'other', 'hand', 'ask', 'why', ""n't"", 'need', 'money']",N/A

I think the old Sean was ruled by his loins, he was lustfully attracted to his lover yet loved his wife. After re-incarnation only the love survived, the lust being of the earth, of the flesh - died and was forgotton - this is why the young re-incarnated Sean doesnt remember having loved the former lover. Another theory is that the re-incarnated Sean is a child and has no real concept of lustful attraction so any memories of a lustful relationship with the lover are irrelevent to him.I also noticed the vague similarity the film bears to Polanski's Rosemary's Baby, Mia's hair couldn't be more like Kidman's here, she lives with her lover in a building which they share with an odd familly (just like RB)who changes their world in a way which directly involves a child. Also Mia's vulnerability is very similiar to Kidman's vulnerability here and the whole New York yuppie lifestyle is here as well. Polanski himself was disgraced by a sexual relationship with a minor.It is a lovely perfect piece of symbolism when the lover buries the letters in the ground, the symbol of Sean's lustful attraction towards the lover are thus buried as Sean's physical body itself was buried, Sean's body being a symbol of his lust, both died permanently in the earth. At the end of the film, the scene were Kidman and her new husband are at the beach gives all the clues, she is unhappy - she wants Sean. A complicated and sophisticated film which poses many questions and dilemmas for the viewer none was more controversial than the situation were if Kidman were to follow her true love, her dream - it would mean going with a 10 year old boy.

885405,A2ARRAMXWT83PT,B0007P0X9G,Steven Adam Renkovish,"[3, 3]","This film is a psychological mystery that calls to mind the works of Stanley Kubrick and Steven Speilberg. Much controversy was made over this film when it was released - and understandably so - but it is so well acted, and handled with such subtlety that you become completely engrossed with the story. Nicole Kidman was nominated for a Golden Globe for her performance, and I believe that she should have been nominated for an Oscar.The story is about a woman named Anna, who is preparing to marry her second husband, Joseph. Her first husband, Sean, passed away a few years ago, and she is still greiving his death. One day, a ten year old boy shows up at her mother's birthday party unannounced, and tells her that he is her late husband. At first, she forcefully asks him to leave, but he refuses to leave her alone. He knows things about Sean that no one else would have known. He knows intimate details about her friends and family, and soon it becomes overwhelming, and she starts to believe that it is a possibility that this young man could be the reincarnation of her husband. Most of the film is about her inner struggle with this complicated situation, but the best thing about the film is that it handles it with common sense. The characters act realistically, and that makes all the difference. This film avoids sappiness at all costs, and that makes it all the more powerful and unsettling.Young co-star Cameron Bright is quite good in his complicated role. People may say that he is simply imitating Haley Joel Osment, but they would be wrong. This is not your typical ""creepy kid"" role. He brings real depth to the material, and is totally convincing. Screen veteran Lauren Bacall is always a joy to watch, and she plays Kidman's mother.This is probably one of the most misunderstood films of 2004. Yes, the ending does seem like a cop-out, but I believe it is open to multiple interpretations.

Yet, as many people know, strange, unexplainable things DO occur all the time, and perhaps we aren't as wise and self assured as we'd like to believe.Don't expect any hard evidence in ""Birth"" to convince you of this; the telling rests within the atmosphere and underlying vibes of the characters. It is one thing to claim understanding of something which is widely accepted, and quite another to instinctively 'know' something that may defy common perception.Sean's mistress claims, ""You would've come to me first, but you didn't"".Yet, Sean *did* trail her at the onset, didn't he?Sean's mistress claims that Sean gave her the unopened love letters from his wife in order to prove that ""he loved me more"".Perhaps.However, maybe he gave them to her unopened because he honestly loved wis wife and couldn't read them, nor wanted to keep them, out of dire guilt. And when he ""returned"", he instinctively honed directly in on that love in his life which he deeply regretted jeopardizing? Maybe the soul of Sean's mistress held sway over him in a way he wasn't able to resist in that particular existence, and once freed, returned and sought out what mattered most? Or maybe Sean is an emotionally unbalanced ten year old boy who, although not done out of malice, effectively manipulates several lives?To be honest, this is a difficult movie. There's no other way of stating it. It casts light on aspects of our spirituality, on Love - on what that can possibly entail in the grander scheme of human existence - that, given the substance of this story, can seem cruel and unbearable.However, this is ultimately the stuff of worthy, challanging art which requires and demands the humanity of the viwer. It calls accepted pieties and doctrines into question, and unlike so many common movies which merely serve to opiate the masses, does not make light of the mysterious complexities of the heart and soul.",5,Love's Timeless Quest Inside Looking Out?,1115251200,"05 5, 2005",2005,2661,"['not', 'movie', 'who', 'require', 'nice', 'tidy', 'scientific', 'conclusions', 'odd', 'eerie', 'tale', 'pyschological', 'disturbances', 'emotional', 'manipulation', 'coupled', 'uncanny', 'existential', 'coincidence', 'reincarnation', 'are', 'there', 'really', 'ANY', 'coincidences', ""'reasonably"", 'conclusive', 'explanation', 'alluded', 'film', 'wisely', 'allowing', 'take', 'hold', 'convincing', 'satisfying', 'way.Which', 'say', 'pragmatic', 'explanation', '*could*', 'be', 'red', 'herring', 'subtle', 'revelations', 'are', 'easily', 'buried', 'effectivness', 'misdirection', 'possibly', 'viewers', 'inherent', 'tendency', 'seek', 'solid', 'familiar', 'footing', 'what', 'how', ""'re"", 'attuned', 'daily', 'round', 'life', 'largely', 'lending', 'credence', 'paranormal', 'Yet', 'many', 'people', 'know', 'strange', 'unexplainable', 'things', 'DO', 'occur', 'time', 'perhaps', 'are', ""n't"", 'wise', 'self', 'assured', ""'d"", 'like', 'believe.Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'hard', 'evidence', 'Birth', 'convince', 'telling', 'rests', 'atmosphere', 'underlying', 'vibes', 'characters', 'one', 'thing', 'claim', 'understanding', 'something', 'widely', 'accepted', 'quite', 'instinctively', ""'know"", 'something', 'may', 'defy', 'common', 'perception.Sean', 'mistress', 'claims', 'would', ""'ve"", 'come', 'first', 'did', ""n't"", '.Yet', 'Sean', '*did*', 'trail', 'onset', 'did', ""n't"", 'Sean', 'mistress', 'claims', 'Sean', 'gave', 'unopened', 'love', 'letters', 'wife', 'order', 'prove', 'loved', 'more', '.Perhaps.However', 'maybe', 'gave', 'unopened', 'honestly', 'loved', 'wis', 'wife', 'could', ""n't"", 'read', 'wanted', 'keep', 'dire', 'guilt', 'when', 'returned', 'instinctively', 'honed', 'directly', 'love', 'life', 'deeply', 'regretted', 'jeopardizing', 'Maybe', 'soul', 'Sean', 'mistress', 'held', 'sway', 'way', 'was', ""n't"", 'able', 'resist', 'particular', 'existence', 'once', 'freed', 'returned', 'sought', 'out', 'what', 'mattered', 'most', 'maybe', 'Sean', 'emotionally', 'unbalanced', 'ten', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'who', 'not', 'done', 'malice', 'effectively', 'several', 'lives', 'be', 'honest', 'difficult', 'movie', 'other', 'way', 'stating', 'light', 'aspects', 'spirituality', 'Love', 'what', 'can', 'possibly', 'entail', 'grander', 'scheme', 'human', 'existence', 'given', 'substance', 'story', 'can', 'seem', 'cruel', 'unbearable.However', 'ultimately', 'stuff', 'worthy', 'challanging', 'art', 'humanity', 'viwer', 'accepted', 'pieties', 'doctrines', 'question', 'so', 'many', 'common', 'movies', 'merely', 'serve', 'opiate', 'masses', 'not', 'make', 'light', 'mysterious', 'complexities', 'heart', 'soul']",N/A

Finally, he keels over.  Then we see a newborn baby.Next, we are told that it is ten years later.  Anna (Nicole Kidman), is the widow of the running man.  She has become engaged to Joseph, rather pompous and boring, but not bad-looking.  They are having a birthday party at what turns out to be her mother's (Lauren Bacall)very expensive apartment.  Apparently the whole familia lives there - but I had to deduce bit by bit who was who (never did figure out the identity of the lady who told Anna there was no Santa Claus) - her pregnant siter, who looks nothing like Anna, her husband, Anna and her fiance Joseph (sleeping in the same bed - apparently her mom is pretty liberal), and of course, the mother.  Oh, and the maid.Into this very well-ordered and stodgy existence, steps Sean, a ten year old boy who proclaims himself to be Anna's dead husband, also named Sean.  At first Anna doesn't believe him (nobody else ever does), but then she succumbs to her desire to be reunited with her beloved husband, albeit not much you can do with a ten year old boy who has absolutely no sense of humour, no charm, and of course, nothing in common with Anna.  But, he says he loves her.  And people believe what they want to believe, what they need to believe.The movie was dark and grainy.  Much of it made no sense.  There was no background on Anna and her husband Sean's relationship (except the minute amount you hear from a third party).This film wasn't terrible.  I laughed several times at the sheer ridiculousness of some of the scenes.  But most of it was pretty dull, especially several minutes focusing on Anna's face.  A sex scene that wasn't necessary, and then went on far too long.  Long closeups of Sean's face.  Well, I guess they had to fill the time somehow.  The film was only 140 minutes long, so it was bearable.Unless you can relate to losing someone and hoping that for some reason that person would show up in the body a ten year old, I can't really recommend this movie as worthwhile.",2,People With Too Much Time On Their Hands,1102550400,"12 9, 2004",2004,2135,"['movie', 'man', 'running', 'snowy', 'park', 'more', 'More', 'running', 'Run', 'run', 'run', 'Finally', 'Then', 'see', 'newborn', 'baby.Next', 'are', 'told', 'ten', 'years', 'later', 'Anna', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'widow', 'running', 'man', 'become', 'engaged', 'Joseph', 'rather', 'pompous', 'boring', 'not', 'bad-looking', 'are', 'having', 'birthday', 'party', 'what', 'out', 'be', 'mother', 'Lauren', 'Bacall', 'very', 'expensive', 'apartment', 'Apparently', 'whole', 'familia', 'had', 'deduce', 'bit', 'bit', 'who', 'was', 'who', 'never', 'did', 'figure', 'out', 'identity', 'lady', 'who', 'told', 'Anna', 'was', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'pregnant', 'siter', 'who', 'nothing', 'Anna', 'husband', 'Anna', 'fiance', 'Joseph', 'sleeping', 'same', 'bed', 'apparently', 'mom', 'pretty', 'liberal', 'course', 'mother', 'Oh', 'maid.Into', 'very', 'well-ordered', 'stodgy', 'existence', 'steps', 'Sean', 'ten', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'who', 'be', 'Anna', 'dead', 'husband', 'also', 'named', 'Sean', 'first', 'Anna', ""n't"", 'believe', 'nobody', 'else', 'ever', 'then', 'desire', 'be', 'reunited', 'beloved', 'husband', 'not', 'much', 'can', 'do', 'ten', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'who', 'absolutely', 'sense', 'humour', 'charm', 'course', 'nothing', 'common', 'Anna', 'people', 'believe', 'what', 'want', 'believe', 'what', 'need', 'believe.The', 'movie', 'was', 'dark', 'grainy', 'Much', 'made', 'sense', 'was', 'background', 'Anna', 'husband', 'Sean', 'relationship', 'minute', 'amount', 'hear', 'third', 'party', '.This', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'laughed', 'several', 'times', 'sheer', 'ridiculousness', 'scenes', 'most', 'was', 'pretty', 'dull', 'especially', 'several', 'minutes', 'focusing', 'Anna', 'face', 'sex', 'scene', 'was', ""n't"", 'necessary', 'then', 'went', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'Long', 'closeups', 'Sean', 'face', 'Well', 'guess', 'had', 'fill', 'time', 'somehow', 'film', 'was', 'only', '140', 'minutes', 'long', 'was', 'can', 'relate', 'losing', 'someone', 'hoping', 'reason', 'person', 'would', 'show', 'up', 'body', 'ten', 'year', 'old', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'recommend', 'movie', 'worthwhile']",N/A

Take Birth for example, a movie in which a ten year old boy comes up to Nicole Kidman's Anna and tells her that he is her husband.  The first part of the movie is genuinely interesting as Anna wrestles with this information, at first laughing it off.  But just the hint of her husband's death brings back emotions that she has to fight off.Unfortunately, the film devolves from there, starting with conversations about sex with the ten year old and leading to the inevitable bath tub scene in which Anna is naked in the tub and the boy joins her, also naked.  I'm sorry, but I don't care if you think the god of orgasms has been reincarnated in the body of a ten year old, you just don't do that.But what bothered me most is that the script was a mess that gave no real actions for its actors.  Anna goes from not believing to believing awfully fast and when she gets to that believing part she holds onto it as if it were driftwood out in the ocean.  Joseph, Anna's fiance, goes from being a generally okay guy to wigging out and spanking Sean.  Speaking of Sean, and I can't really go into it without being a spoiler but I'm going to try so if you don't want to know anything stop reading, his whole reincarnated thing became stupid as the movie went along.  SPOILER: he has many deep rooted issues if one letter could set him off into thinking what he does.  It just wasn't believable.  Silly and stupid.By the end of the movie, I was so tired of the concept.  I was genuinely intrigued to see how they would handle this and was grossly put off at the execution of it.

885409,A2GCCVXI3LOQDE,B0007P0X9G,T.F.,"[11, 17]","If you're contemplating buying this movie, save your money.  Rent it at the dollar weekly rental place first, watch it - and then decide whether to buy it or not.  From reading reviews here, some people really think this is a great film.  I can't quite wrap my head around this, for the following reasons.This movie is irritatingly artsy.  In fact, it works so hard to be artsy that you can hear the creak of the artsy machinery - and the endlessly long scenes make it grindingly boring as well.  The story could have been told in a thirty minute short film, but this thing drags on for hours.  Unfortunately, since there is so little depth to the story and so little depth to any of the characters, the artsiness consists mainly of painfully endless closeups of the characters glaring at each other while the turgid soundtrack moans on and on and on.  Much was made of the fact that Nicole Kidman performs the longest closeup of movie history in this movie, and she does.  Why isn't exactly clear.  Someone has done a horrific pluck job on her eyebrows, making her look like a cross between Mr. Spock and Joan Crawford, and having to watch her glaring into the camera for however many minutes was just annoying.Everyone in the film is creepy - the kid who claims (falsely, it turns out) to be the reincarnation of Kidman's dead husband, Kidman's sister and mother, Kidman's fiance, Kidman's dead husband's girlfriend.  They all seem to wear black or beige all the time, they live in these creepily luxurious apartments, they glare at and boss each other around constantly.  Kidman looks pasty and zombielike, and acts like a zombie as well.This movie is about as compelling as three day old scrambled eggs.  Much ado about nothing, with a lot of backflips done to try to make it into an art film.  If a film can't make at least one character that an audience can care about, in the long run, what's it all for?  Nobody in this turgid, overlong, dreary, trying-oh-so-hard to be shocking film is at all compelling.  The viewer just doesn't give a darn what happens to any of them.Why bother?",1,Snore.

885413,A3AUECYM0M0YSX,B0007P0X9G,The Man in the Hathaway Shirt,"[4, 5]","Oh man...This film came so close to blowing me away.So close...Birth could have been a masterpiece...if only it could have found a way out of its own dilemma.The Amazon review states: Birth is a melancholy chamber piece, its pensive mood sustained by nearly sub-sonic nuances in a fine, thematically developed score by Alexandre Desplat.All so true.  The cinematography, music, lighting, set design, costuming, casting, performances--but oh, especially the music--all add up to one of the freshest, most original movie-going experiences in a long time.  The premise is highly original.  The set-up is bold.  There are some brave scenes in this movie.  I know some people found them ""distasteful.""  I didn't.  A little audacious, maybe even hard to watch at times, but necessary for the story.The problem with films where you weave a very unusual tale, where there's an idea that knocks you off-kilter, is the solution, the ending, has to be equally stunning. Anything less is a cop-out, and the audience walks away feeling cheated.Well, hope this doesn't spoil it for you, but you're gonna feel cheated.  Big time.  The last ten or fifteen minutes are some of the lamest material attached to some of the greatest material that I have ever seen.  All through this film I kept thinking ""How on *earth* are they going to pull this off?""  Well, they didn't.The performances are spot on, although I think these wealthy penthouse folks are a bit more indulgent to Sean than such people would be in real life--I think real rich folks would be more afraid this is a set up to get at their money.  But there's something about this film that just feels and looks so right.  Director Jonathan Glazer has a stylish eye and a great feel for rhythm (don't believe the reviews that say this film will put you to sleep; only if you're already dead will that happen).  And he manages to convey ""interior"" moments brilliantly, which is one of the hardest things to do in cinema.  There's an incredible scene where Kidman's character goes to the opera.  We crane in on her face as she and her fianc&eacute; sit down: the camera holds on her face for something like two minutes while she comes to a conclusion.  The music and the photography and Kidman's perfect portrayal as a wealthy and polished woman who is nonetheless very soft at the center and somewhat off-center since the death of her husband combine to create a completely satisfying moment, one that changes the direction of the film at that point and propels it into the second act flawlessly--and it's all done without a single word of dialogue being spoken by anyone.  That's cinema.  One of the writers is none other than Jean-Claude Carri&egrave;re, who also wrote the screenplay for The Unbearable Lightness of Being, another ""interior"" movie, this one with a perfectly-realized ending.The other performances are also very fine--measured, elegant, low-key, and focused, except for Anne Heche, who is more neurotic than the others, and perfectly so.  It's almost as though we're watching a well-written and directed stage play--that even though I just got done lauding how cinematic the film otherwise is.  Well, it's that good, combining the best of many artforms--until that grossly misconceived ending.  Yes, there is some derivation from The Sixth Sense, more in terms of its oddball conception than in execution.  But I think this film is more stylish, more confident, even if Sixth Sense managed an ending that surprised us and yet was perfectly logical within the world it created, and this film did not.  There are also echoes of Rosemary's Baby,  especially with Nicole's hair and slightly Mia Farrowish voice, although that film, by a director I greatly admire, Roman Polansky, never quite worked for me.  David Thomson, in his creepy book on Nicole Kidman, describes the film as ""Henry james on the edge of the supernatural,"" which is just about right.Despite my disappointment in Birth, I'm going to recommend it, especially if you like ""out of the box"" films as I do.

From the studio's synopsis, one might expect a meditation on life, death and reincarnation. But instead we get a weirdly detached, soulless montage including: a random sex scene with her creepy mutant boyfriend, a two-minute slow zoom on Nicole's face as she emotes while attending the opera, a muddled sub-plot involving Anne Heche and a box of incriminating letters in a hidey-hole at the park, a few hundred instances of a chubby ten-year-old saying ""I am Sean, I am your husband"", and a pointless scene where the aforementioned tyke gets naked with the smoking hot post-facelift Aussie in the bathtub. Thankfully, we don't see his little wee-wee, but it's still just plain wrong. (Imagine for a moment a studio releasing a flick where a ten year old girl strips naked and gets in the tub with Mel Gibson or Russell Crowe, and claims to be the reincarnation of his wife. That's right, it would never be released, and rightly so).There are so many better things you could do with two hours of your life.

God forbid if I were to drag my husband to watch it in the theater... watching it at home on DVD was acceptable, but not a lot more then that.The feeling I remain with after the viewing is mainly some disappointment at the fact that the movie did not take a stand - does it or doesn't it believe in reincarnation? I know it is better to leave the issue vague and undefined but this is exactly what I was expecting and I did wish for some surprises. I mean, I did expect to be given a ""way out"" of our first inclination to say ""Yes, this is indeed the (returned) husband"". I did wait the information which will shed light on the way Sean (the child) knew all the things he did... and off course as the movie moves along, this is exactly what happens. At about two thirds of the movie we receive a way out.I guess some of my disappointment is with the issue itself; wouldn't it be nice to know that indeed loved ones can return, as alarming as this may sound? Naturally I would love to get an answer.The truth is, this movie is not bizarre enough. Instead of a real discussion of the issue and some of its aspects, the movie turns to be some sort of a detective movie in which we search for clues and try to determine could he or couldn't he...  Does the child know enough or doesn't he? Following the viewing I do not find myself thinking of the subject itself, but rather on trying to fill up the holes that remain in the story and to see if I can fill them up the new information. How for example did the child know who is the person that told Anna there is no Santa Claus?I thought the young Sean was nice, but definitely not a good actor. His sad, mysterious gazes were not enough to give his character a lot of substance.

Is he really saying the truth? Or is this just a prank (which must be a very cruel one). Or, is it the boy's delusion? The plot of `Birth' is intriguing, with several questions about the way we perceive hard reality, but the film fails to develop it beyond its initial premise, which needs more careful treatment.I know Nicole Kidman is a gifted actress, and she does not disappoint us as Anna who is going to marry Joseph (Danny Huston). She lost her husband Sean ten years ago, and it is suggested that she has just recovered from the shock of his death.When Anna is about to embark on her new life, another `Sean' enters her life, as a ten-year-old boy (Cameron Bright) who lives downstairs in the same building where Joseph lives. This new Sean not only claims that he is the reincarnation of her lost husband, but sends her a message telling not to marry Joseph. Anna at first does not take him seriously, but as the resolute boy comes back again, she starts to look at him differently, or in short, falls in love with this `Sean.'I admit the film's merit as study of our belief, heart, love, or whatever worth mentioning in film, but `Birth' just fails to convince. I'm not talking about the `bathtub' scene some may find embarrassing. I am talking about the character of Anna, which needs more finesse, or subtlety. If you have to convince us that a level-headed lady can really fall in love with a ten-year-old boy who says he is her dead husband, you need more than frequent close-ups of Nicole Kidman (with her good acting though), the film's beautiful images and evocative music score. I know what the director Jonathan Glazer is trying to do. Among the many mysteries in this world, our heart is the most incomprehensive one. Still our heart does not respond to the little boy simply because the script tells it to do so.For all its intention, I could not help feeling that what Anna is doing is just unbelievable. `Birth' is full of visual mystification, but its content is not as substantial as other better films like `Under the Sand.'",2,"Visually Evocative, But Its Content Fails to Convince",1161820800,"10 26, 2006",2006,2235,"['10', 'year-old', 'boy', 'approaches', 'middle-age', 'lady', 'who', 'lost', 'husband', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'boy', 'very', 'serious', 'face', 'HE', 'reincarnation', 'dead', 'husband', 'really', 'saying', 'truth', 'just', 'prank', 'must', 'be', 'very', 'cruel', 'one', 'boy', 'delusion', 'plot', 'Birth', 'intriguing', 'several', 'questions', 'way', 'perceive', 'hard', 'reality', 'film', 'develop', 'initial', 'premise', 'more', 'careful', 'treatment.I', 'know', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'gifted', 'actress', 'not', 'disappoint', 'Anna', 'who', 'going', 'marry', 'Joseph', 'Danny', 'Huston', 'lost', 'husband', 'Sean', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'suggested', 'just', 'recovered', 'shock', 'death.When', 'Anna', 'embark', 'new', 'life', 'Sean', 'enters', 'life', 'ten-year-old', 'boy', 'Cameron', 'Bright', 'who', 'downstairs', 'same', 'building', 'where', 'Joseph', 'new', 'Sean', 'not', 'only', 'reincarnation', 'lost', 'husband', 'message', 'telling', 'not', 'marry', 'Joseph', 'Anna', 'first', 'not', 'take', 'seriously', 'resolute', 'boy', 'back', 'again', 'look', 'differently', 'short', 'love', 'Sean', 'admit', 'film', 'merit', 'study', 'belief', 'heart', 'love', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'film', 'Birth', 'just', 'convince', ""'m"", 'not', 'talking', 'bathtub', 'may', 'find', 'embarrassing', 'am', 'talking', 'character', 'Anna', 'more', 'finesse', 'subtlety', 'have', 'convince', 'level-headed', 'lady', 'can', 'really', 'fall', 'love', 'ten-year-old', 'boy', 'who', 'dead', 'husband', 'need', 'more', 'frequent', 'close-ups', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'good', 'acting', 'film', 'beautiful', 'images', 'evocative', 'music', 'score', 'know', 'what', 'director', 'Jonathan', 'Glazer', 'trying', 'do', 'many', 'mysteries', 'world', 'heart', 'most', 'incomprehensive', 'one', 'Still', 'heart', 'not', 'respond', 'little', 'boy', 'simply', 'script', 'do', 'so.For', 'intention', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'feeling', 'what', 'Anna', 'doing', 'just', 'unbelievable', 'Birth', 'full', 'visual', 'mystification', 'content', 'not', 'as', 'substantial', 'other', 'better', 'films', 'Sand']",N/A

885420,A2KU5PG32H7QBN,B0007P0X9G,"wannabemoviecritic ""wannabemoviecritic""","[12, 15]","Nicole Kidman is an absolute wonder.  There is no limit to how she astounds me with the nuance she brings to the roles she takes on.  As one of the most acclaimed actresses of her day, all I can say is that she deserves it.  It is also adimirable of Kidman that she chooses such challenging roles.  Just take a minute to consider the people she has played: an arguably insane woman suffering from intense paranoia in 'The Others'; a prostitute who breaks free from her belief that love doesn't pay in 'Moulin Rouge!'; Virginia Woolf on the verge of suicide in 'The Hours'; a Scarlett O'Hara-esque woman longing for a love lost in war in 'Cold Mountain'; the suffering Grace who is subjected to slavery in 'Dogville;' and now, in 'Birth,' Anna, a woman who, after finally getting over the loss of her husband ten years after his death, is approached by a ten-year-old boy claiming to be him reincarnated.  Quite the impressive list, no?  It is growing and will probably rival that of Meryl Streep or Cate Blanchett.  As mentioned, 'Birth' provides Kidman with yet another complex role, and again, she is perfect (in fact, more than perfect) and this is starting to become an inevitability.In 'Birth,' after a little boy named Sean approaches Kidman claiming to be her dead husband Sean, Kidman's Anna begins to suffer immensely; you are able to see it in the way she moves, the way she speaks and carries herself.  In a cramped hallway, Sean's father tells him to apologize for his nagging, and as Sean insists that he will not stop, Anna bends over, looks him in the eye, and says, ""You're hurting me.  You know that?  You're hurting me.""  Kidman brings so much power to those words, to every word spoken.  When she slowly begins to accept that this boy may after all be her dead husband, the character Anna's hopefulness and possible delusion are appropriately convincing.  It takes an Oscar-worthy performance to cause a situation as far fetched as the one in 'Birth' to seem real in the most painfully visceral sense, and Kidman never loses her balance.  However, it is not just Kidman's performance that makes the film so effectively suspenseful.The perspective with which director Jonathan Glazer and his fellow screenwriters approach 'Birth' is that of an elite cynic, like many of the central characters in the film (in fact, during 'Birth's opening, you hear the real Sean reassuring the audience at some sort of conference that he is a man of science, that he does not allow himself to buy into such ""nonsense"").  The approach is successful in making the film unsettling because it is the approach most in a world that needs solid proof would take if such a claim were made, especially considering the fact that the concept of reincarnation is of religious origin.  One can relate to Anna's mindset of uncertainty mixed with nostalgia.  When Anna's sense of longing is matched by strong possibility, the screenplay and direction make us feel involved in the situation rather than pushed away by its absurdity.  The controversial bath tub scene, though modestly handled, is the single large flaw in Glazer's attempts to universalize the film, because it alienates rather than invites.Throughout 'Birth,' there is a lack of build to its shattering climactic scene between a bitingly precise Anne Heche and Cameron Bright, the young actor who plays ten-year-old Sean.  However, there are many masterful moments conjured by the film making team that are immensely memorable, which is much more than most films can offer.  Consider when Anna's husband, Joseph (Danny Huston), unleashes his anger toward young Sean in the midst of a wedding announcement, or when Anna and Joseph attend an opera following young Sean's collapse after being refused by her; Kidman's face contorts in sadness, in happiness, longing, a moment so magical and appropriately elongated that one feels nearly overwhelmed with power.  While viewing the film you are able to tell its director is a strong one that knows what he's doing and how to elicit concrete reaction from his audience.  These many moments of greatness are alone worth the price of admission.One of those many glorious scenes is the opening sequence: it is simply Sean, a figure wrapped in warm, black clothing, jogging through Central Park through the cool curtain of snow.  It manages to encapsulate the tone of 'Birth.'  First of all, it best exemplifies Harris Savides' mesmerizing camera work, slow and elongated to allow the power of each moment to sink in (this is reflective of a Stanley Kubrick film).  Alexandre Desplat's best-of-the-year dramatic score dots the sequence with both delicate and grandiose undertones, growing most quiet when the word 'Birth' spirals out over a snowy pathway while Sean runs in the background, a lone triangle tapping its way through a wintry solace.  Never before has an opening sequence alone been enough to fully absorb me into a film.At 'Birth's end, two answers to the film's question are presented: both are equally plausible, which in turn futhers the film's ability to intrigue and to convince.  Also, the ending continues to provoke thoughts back to earlier parts of the film; a case of fine construction on Jonathan Glazer's part (apparently, he spent months editing and re-editing in order to create the pitch-perfect effect, and I believe his work paid off).  As the credits roll following perhaps the most devastatingly ambiguous image in a film I've seen within the last three or four years, we are left with the memory of great acting, great editing, great camera work, great writing, great direction, and great scoring.  Honestly, what more does one ask for from a film?  'Birth' is impeccably skilled to every last detail, and it is a shame that it has been so wrongfully underrated by the critics and by the public.  However, I am not surprised since the disregarding of great work has become as common as expecting something profound from Nicole Kidman every time she goes to work.",5,Great sophomore effort from

Enter a 10-year-old boy named Sean (Cameron Bright), who claims to be the reincarnation of her dead husband, also named Sean.  Everyone is skeptical until the boy begins to reveal information that only the older Sean could have known.  Is he truly the re-birth of Kidman's husband?The plot outline sounded intriguing to me, with a multitude of possible directions to explore.  For example, I would be interested in what Anna thinks about someone claiming to be her husband.  What feelings did it bring forth for her?  Unfortunately, all parties involved in this film botched it massively.  The script never examines HOW these people feel about the events.  Scene after scene is filled with people doubting that the child is Sean, but no one discusses what the older Sean meant to them or what these boy's claims elicit in them.  The script is also devoid of any humor, taking instead a dreadfully serious tone.In addition, the plot takes several salacious turns, most notably during several scenes in which young Sean makes intimate overtures to Kidman (sharing a bathtub, kissing her).  These scenes are not graphic but quite disturbing nevertheless.  In another scene, Kidman begins exploring with young Sean what would happen if they did become a couple again, asking him if he's ever made love to a girl.  Not many 10-year-old boys are sexually active, Nicole!  The movie ends up coming off creepy, and one is left wondering how in the world the savvy Kidman became involved in this mess.Directed by Jonathan Glazer who did the far superior ""Sexy Beast,"" the movie has a terrific look -- icy and gorgeous.  However, the cinematography is the only redeeming quality.  Kidman is good in a few scenes, but her character is so under-developed that it's difficult to call her overall performance good.  She did, however, somewhat inexplicably receive a Golden Globe nomination.Ultimately, ""Birth"" is a movie with an interesting idea, but it resoundingly fails to explore the scenario with any nuance.  The ending is a particularly cryptic and unsatisfying disaster.  The DVD also has very few extras and no director's commentary, disallowing further understanding of the film.

One particular night a boy approaches her claiming to be her husband re-incarnated.  The boy knows many personal details which support his claim, and Nicole begins to believe him, and fall in love with him.  Sounds ridiculous, and frankly it is.  The theme could have been handled so much better, but by the end of the film you just feel like you have wasted 90 minutes of your time because the boy is a fraud.  I would have preferred it if he was the real deal.Those things aside, Nicole delivers an effective performance as a woman torned by the possibilities of being with her deceased husband again.  To be with that special person one more time.  Lauren Bacall's performance was short and you have to wonder why they bothered as she was not utilised.BIRTH is a strange film but worth seeing once.

She's pretty convincing in this movie, but let's face it, it's a weak film, and doing a 3-minute close-up shot in a scene and making the audience like myself wonder if she was going to break down into tears or something did not work. There was some good moments in this film, but it suffered from a lack of thrill and a poor plotline.Anna(Kidman) was about to get married again after her ex-husband(Sean) died 10 years ago, and a 10 year-old boy named Sean (Cameron Bright)appeared at her mother's(Lauren Bacall) apartment to tell her he's ""Sean"". She freaked out when he told her not to married his fiance. At first, she thought the kid was some psycho playing a head game, but eventually the kid told him many things that only her dead husband knew about. So she started to take him seriously.The fiance, family members, and the kid's parents were all puzzled by the situation. Anna was on the verge of breaking the engagement off and run away with the kid, so that in 11 years he will be 21, and they can get married. That's when the dead Sean's lover(Anne Heche) came in and solved the mystery....Cameron Bright did a very good job in this film, because he had to be realistic and mature. He's as good as other kid actors like Rory Culkin. Anne Heche stole a few scenes with very little screen time. Lauren Bacall's role was underwritten and ornamental, and she was mostly in ""group scenes"". The unexpected ending didn't connect well to everything in the movie. I am not going to spoil it for you, but I didn't like it.
