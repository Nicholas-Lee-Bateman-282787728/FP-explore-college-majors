The truth is that, like the Beatles, Robert Allen Zimmerman's life (aka Bob Dylan) has been documented in unprecedented ways - these are true icons of our times. And he is still making music, ""Tempest' being his most recent effort.  It is also true that Dylan's life as a musician has had quite an interesting evolution. The very absorbing and illuminating ""Bob Dylan and The Band - Down in the Flood"" provides an honest look at one of those chapters in Dylan's evolution that left a mark in the history of Rock & Roll.The documentary begins by informing us that ""in 1966, Dylan began his first electric world tour -- landmark moment that divided his audience. Backing him was a Canadian group called The Hawks, later renamed The Band."" These words serve to introduce us to the history of The Band in Toronto, Canada, and we are told that popular Ronnie Hawkins & The Hawks was kind of the main motor for the group. After Ronnie's separation from the group, it became Levon and The Hawks, named after drummer Levon Helm. With time, Levon quit the group when they went to work for Dylan, and they eventually became simply The Band. The film also includes material from the period in which The Band moved to Woodstock, after finishing their engagement with Dylan, and how they generated some interesting music during that time. Of course, we also watch footage from Dylan's performance with the group on the electric tour, in which they were booed by the people that didn't like Dylan's musical change of musical direction. It also goes in detail about Dylan's motorcycle accident, Helm's return to the group, Dylan and The Band in the Isle of Wright in 1974, the recordings that they did together, the so-called ""basement tapes,"" and, of course, the reunion of the Band with Dylan and other guest artists, which resulted in the film ""The Last Waltz,"" directed my Martin Scorsese. In addition, there is also some footage about Dylan working with other artists in different projects, like Johnny Cash and Earl Scruggs.The film features interviews with writers Anthony De Curtis, Derek Barker, and Robert Christgau, as well as musicians as Garth Hudson, Charlie McCoy, Ronnie Hawkins, and producer John Simon. Some of the songs or part of songs, performed by Dylan include: Baby Let Me follow you down, Big River, Million Dollar Bash, Nothing was delivered, Don't ya tell Henry, Sign of the Cross, All along the Watchtower, and more. Songs with The Band include The Weight, Long Black Veil, Chest Fever, Tears of Rage, I shall be released, King Harvest, among others.""Bob Dylan and The Band - Down in the Flood"" is full of information and archival footage, a must for any fan of Bob Dylan, The Band, or the two together - it is Rock & Roll history at best, a keeper for sure.

1553475,A1HCSEPEK7VRIZ,B008HFS4XU,L'ternel sourire,"[5, 6]","This new documentary tells the partial story of Bob Dylan and The Band between the early 1960's up to the final concert together, as filmed in 1976 for The Last Waltz (Special Edition)The Last Waltz (Special Edition). Some portions are about Dylan on his own, while others focus on The Band without Dylan. The important thing to say is that there is no complete performance to be seen here, only some 10 seconds clips with comments on voice-over, from time to time. For example, you will not see here the performance from circa 1968 appearing on this DVD's front cover. The oldest documents show the original Hawks as a backing group with Ronnie Hawkins playing ""Who Do You Love?"", but again, only for a few seconds. Discussions are often instructive, especially those with The Band original producer John Simon and brief comments by keyboard genius Garth Hudson. Among survivors, we see as well drummer Mickey Jones, who took the place of Levon Helm during the 1966 European tour of Bob Dylan and The Band; he reflects on those years and acknowledges the fact that Dylan generously paid him for a full year after his 1966 motorcycle accident because of the cancelled U.S. tour that would have taken place later in August 1966, even though he was not forced to. Later, Charlie McCoy (a studio musician from Nashville who played on three Dylan albums) reflects as well about the recording sessions made WITHOUT The Band, for instance during the 1968 John Wesley Harding sessions and the 1969 Nashville Skyline sessions. But keep in mind most of the film (almost 2 hours) is a succession of talking heads discussing Dylan and The Band shows, recordings, and reunions. So don't expect to see moments from the great, unfilmed (?) 1974 tour of Dylan with The Band; there is none of that ""Golden Age"" era to be seen here. Elsewhere, you can watch a glimpse of about 30 seconds from the 1969 Isle of Wight concert (as partly heard on the Self Portrait albumSelf Portrait) with 3 of The Beatles sitting in the crowd, and that's it. You can also see the 1966 Dylan speaking about his European tour and the ""electric"" controversy (possibly with excerpts taken from the rare 1966 documentary titled Eat the DocumentEat The Document). Overall frustrating for those who want to watch live performances of Dylan or for those who need to listen to complete songs in rare versions, but nevertheless interesting for the fan who wants to understand how this timeless music evolved and changed between 1965 and 1976. No extras, no subtitles, no booklet.

1553476,A3AY1AO8U0IUV3,B008HFS4XU,"Smrz ""smrz""","[9, 10]","I must admit that I approached this dvd with a fair degree of scrutiny, due to the fact that it was one of those ""UNAUTHORIZED"" releases. I must say, however, both my friend & myself were very pleased with this recent release. Due to the fact that it was unauthorized, I had to look very closely at exactly who was involved in the making of this dvd. With some rare footage of recordings, some performance footage, and talking heads mainly with key participants that included rock journalist Robert Christgau, producer John Simon, & musicians Garth Hudson, Mickey Jones, & Charlie Mccoy, this documentary is very informative & enjoyable. Essentially beginning with some very early footage of The Hawks, who would later become The Band, & Ronnie Hawkins from 1959 performing his hits ""Mary Lou"" & Forty Days, the dvd moves forward capturing all of the important events that charted Dylans' progression with The Band between 1965-1976. Both fans of Dylan, as well as of The Band, will thoroughly enjoy this dvd. The Hawks attracted Dylan's attention while both were playing in Greenwich Village. Both drummer/vocalist Levon Helm & guitarist Robbie Robertson were in the electrified backup group at Dylan's controversial Forest Hills, New York concert of August 28, 1965. Despite a falling out between Dylan and Helm, Dylan then hired The Hawks-with drummerdylan's Mickey Jones in place of Helm-for his controversial 1965-66 world tour. This became the beginnings of a longtime collaboration for both parties . After Dylan's July 29, 1966 famous motorcycle accident, the group settled near the suddenly reclusive Dylan in the Woodstock, New York, area. Shortly thereafter Helm rejoined & they began to record what would evolve into ""The Basement Tapes"". The Band also began to record their own material as well. Most of this new material was written by Roberson and Richard Manuel in a basement studio in the group's house, known as ""Big Pink"". This evolved into Music From Big Pink by The Band. The Band's 2nd LP was simply titled ""The Band"",& Christgau & Simon stressed the importance of the LP as the beginning of what would be known as ""Americana"" music. The dvd then carefully charts the startling new direction that Dylan's music took. Evolving into John Wesley Harding, Nashville Skyline, New Morning, & Planet Waves, which was recorded with The Band. The commentary by the soft-spoken Garth Hudson, who was the Band's organ player, is very interesting. Mickey Jones, the drummer for the infamous tour, spoke of how the crowds would only boo louder as the tour progressed. This only drove Dylan & The Band to play louder, which would only infuriate crowds even more. There is footage from other sources, such as Eat The Document, Don't Look Back, & even Monterey Pop. But there is a substantial amount of footage of the tour, as well as some sessions never seen before, to satisfy both fans of Dylan, as well as the Band. The dvd also emphasizes the idea of how both Dylan & The Band influenced & toured with each other, especially in 1974. The dvd also strongly stresses the importance of this new ""Americana"" music which The Band introduced even more strongly with their 2nd LP. There is even time given to the importance of the very 1st bootleg LP ""Great White Wonder"". All in all, fans of Dylan and/or the Band, will find the dvd a welcome delight. The running time is 114 minutes & it flows along very well. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
