Twelve weeks earlier, during a break to the history-making Diary of a Madman Tour, Ozzy Osbourne's high profile guitarist, Randy Rhoades, died tragically and needlessly in a private plane crash.  Ozzy wrote years later in his autobiography that, ""I don't think I want to be a rock `n roller anymore.""However, as the old saying goes, the show must go on and the tour picked up where it had left off.  In the unenviable position of having to fill the shoes of Randy Rhoades, Brad Gillis was the guitar slinger who ultimately filled the role - and quite well, as a matter of fact. He gelled nicely and seamlessly with Ozzy, Rudy Sarzo (bass), Don Airey (keyboards), and Tommy Aldridge (drums).The dynamic of the band was captured on film that night of June 12th during an epic performance at Irvine Meadows.  The audio has been digitally restored and re-mastered in Dolby 5.1 Surround Sound and in DTS and is being offered to Ozzy fans on crystal clear DVD.All the songs in the entire performance are noteworthy.  Particular Boomerocity favorites are:The concert opener, Over the Mountain, the opening track of the album that served as the tour's namesake had the crowd immediately on its feet and kept them there for the entire show.  Set against a then-precedent setting stage and backdrop, the audience was in mesmerized pleasure until the final song of the show.From Ozzy's first album, Blizzard of Oz, is the heavy metal staple, Crazy Train, which Ozzy and the boys perform flawlessly.Finally, from my high school day is the memorable Black Sabbath classic, Paranoid, from Ozzy's tenure with the band, is delivered as the final song of the evening, giving young and ""old"" fans alike a taste of original heavy metal.Whether you're an Ozzy fan or a Black Sabbath fan, you'll definitely want this DVD as part of your collection.Boomerocity.com",5,Ozzy Speaks of the Devil,1344729600,"08 12, 2012",2012,1871,"['date', 'was', 'June', '12', '1982', 'Twelve', 'weeks', 'earlier', 'break', 'history-making', 'Diary', 'Madman', 'Tour', 'Ozzy', 'Osbourne', 'high', 'profile', 'guitarist', 'Randy', 'Rhoades', 'died', 'tragically', 'needlessly', 'private', 'plane', 'crash', 'Ozzy', 'wrote', 'years', 'later', 'autobiography', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'want', 'be', 'rock', 'n', 'roller', 'anymore', 'However', 'old', 'saying', 'show', 'must', 'go', 'tour', 'picked', 'up', 'where', 'had', 'left', 'off', 'unenviable', 'position', 'having', 'fill', 'shoes', 'Randy', 'Rhoades', 'Brad', 'Gillis', 'was', 'guitar', 'slinger', 'who', 'ultimately', 'filled', 'role', 'quite', 'well', 'matter', 'fact', 'gelled', 'nicely', 'seamlessly', 'Ozzy', 'Rudy', 'Sarzo', 'bass', 'Don', 'Airey', 'keyboards', 'Tommy', 'Aldridge', 'drums', '.The', 'dynamic', 'band', 'was', 'captured', 'film', 'night', 'June', '12th', 'epic', 'performance', 'Irvine', 'Meadows', 'audio', 'been', 'digitally', 'restored', 're-mastered', 'Dolby', '5.1', 'Surround', 'Sound', 'DTS', 'being', 'offered', 'Ozzy', 'fans', 'crystal', 'clear', 'DVD.All', 'songs', 'entire', 'performance', 'are', 'noteworthy', 'Particular', 'Boomerocity', 'favorites', 'are', 'concert', 'opener', 'Mountain', 'opening', 'track', 'album', 'served', 'tour', 'namesake', 'had', 'crowd', 'immediately', 'feet', 'kept', 'entire', 'show', 'Set', 'then-precedent', 'setting', 'stage', 'backdrop', 'audience', 'was', 'mesmerized', 'pleasure', 'final', 'song', 'show.From', 'Ozzy', 'first', 'album', 'Blizzard', 'Oz', 'heavy', 'metal', 'staple', 'Crazy', 'Train', 'Ozzy', 'boys', 'perform', 'flawlessly.Finally', 'high', 'school', 'day', 'memorable', 'Black', 'Sabbath', 'classic', 'Paranoid', 'Ozzy', 'tenure', 'band', 'delivered', 'final', 'song', 'evening', 'giving', 'young', 'old', 'fans', 'taste', 'original', 'heavy', 'metal.Whether', ""'re"", 'Ozzy', 'fan', 'Black', 'Sabbath', 'fan', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'want', 'DVD', 'part', 'collection.Boomerocity.com']",N/A

This is towards the end of the Diary of a Madman tour with Brad Gillis at the throne a few months after Randy's tragic death. Ozzy and the band are on fire here with all the classic songs and the Diary stage set. I was really surprised how well Gillis does with Randy's riffs and solos. Just a amazing guitar player who did this band justice under the circumstances. Audio and picture quality not perfect but not bad at all for 1982.

1538805,A1NF9WS7RR82MX,B007VP1LQO,J. Hill,"[14, 16]","I'm giving this five stars because of its historical and nostalgic value, and for the amazing performance of the band.  The overdubbing on Ozzy's vocals would pull it down to a four if not for the quality of the whole package, which documents heavy metal at its glorious 1980's best.This concert was recorded June 12, 1982 during the Diary of a Madman tour, less than three months after the death of Randy Rhoads.  It's not the same as the CD version, featuring mostly songs from Ozzy's first two solo albums.  Ozzy delivered the goods to the crowd at Irvine Meadows in California, bellowing and running around the stage like a...well, a madman...jumping up and down, clapping and headbanging relentlessly.  He deserves credit for pulling off the rest of that tour after such a terrible tragedy.Brad Gillis, Rudy Sarzo, Tommy Aldridge, and Don Airey are all spectacular backing up the Ozz-man.  The performance of Gillis is nothing less than stunning.  His solo after Suicide Solution, and the subsequent instrumental piece by the band that culminates with Tommy's drum solo, is nearly worth the price of the DVD alone.  Tommy's solos were legendary, climaxing with his feverish hands-only routine.  Rudy Sarzo matches the frantic energy of Gillis, bookending Ozzy with pure heavy metal ferocity.The set and show production exemplify the epic grandeur of 80's concerts.  A huge medieval castle flanks the band.  Airey, cloaked in a black reaper's robe, occupies a balcony of the castle.  A huge laser-light winged bat flies over the band and menaces the crowd.  Aldridge sits atop a huge pyramidal drum riser.  Everything about the staging is humongous, reminding me how much more theatrical big concerts used to be.  It's without question an incredible show to watch.The sound and the picture are good on the DVD.  I don't hear any flaws in the sound, and while the picture might look somewhat fuzzy at times, I like it that way.  TV broadcasts from that era (this was shown on MTV Halloween night) all have that look, and it adds to the vintage feel.  The DVD also comes with a booklet that includes some cool pictures and a piece by Rudy Sarzo about participating in the tour.  It's a nice extra.Even though there are quite a few moments when Ozzy's mouth clearly doesn't match up with the vocals, it does seem like the real vocals are used from time to time.  And all of his shouting and bantering with the crowd is obviously original audio.  Some people have said some of the vocal tracks sound the same as Tribute, but I don't think it is.  There are several songs where Ozzy changes a few notes or his phrasing, and those clearly are not on other live releases.  Overall, I'm very happy they finally put this out officially on DVD.  I see it as a must-have for hardcore Ozzy fans.",5,"Speak of the Devil DVD, Finally Official",1342483200,"07 17, 2012",2012,2787,"[""'m"", 'giving', 'five', 'stars', 'historical', 'nostalgic', 'value', 'amazing', 'performance', 'band', 'overdubbing', 'Ozzy', 'vocals', 'would', 'pull', 'down', 'four', 'not', 'quality', 'whole', 'package', 'documents', 'heavy', 'metal', 'glorious', '1980', 'best.This', 'concert', 'was', 'recorded', 'June', '12', '1982', 'Diary', 'Madman', 'tour', 'less', 'three', 'months', 'death', 'Randy', 'Rhoads', 'not', 'same', 'CD', 'version', 'featuring', 'mostly', 'songs', 'Ozzy', 'first', 'two', 'solo', 'albums', 'Ozzy', 'delivered', 'goods', 'crowd', 'Irvine', 'Meadows', 'California', 'bellowing', 'running', 'around', 'stage', 'well', 'madman', 'jumping', 'up', 'down', 'clapping', 'headbanging', 'relentlessly', 'credit', 'pulling', 'off', 'rest', 'tour', 'terrible', 'tragedy.Brad', 'Gillis', 'Rudy', 'Sarzo', 'Tommy', 'Aldridge', 'Don', 'Airey', 'are', 'spectacular', 'backing', 'up', 'Ozz-man', 'performance', 'Gillis', 'nothing', 'less', 'stunning', 'solo', 'Suicide', 'Solution', 'subsequent', 'instrumental', 'piece', 'band', 'Tommy', 'drum', 'solo', 'nearly', 'worth', 'price', 'DVD', 'alone', 'Tommy', 'solos', 'were', 'legendary', 'climaxing', 'feverish', 'hands-only', 'routine', 'Rudy', 'Sarzo', 'frantic', 'energy', 'Gillis', 'bookending', 'Ozzy', 'pure', 'heavy', 'metal', 'ferocity.The', 'set', 'show', 'production', 'epic', 'grandeur', '80', 'concerts', 'huge', 'medieval', 'castle', 'band', 'Airey', 'cloaked', 'black', 'reaper', 'robe', 'balcony', 'castle', 'huge', 'laser-light', 'winged', 'bat', 'flies', 'band', 'crowd', 'Aldridge', 'atop', 'huge', 'pyramidal', 'drum', 'riser', 'Everything', 'staging', 'humongous', 'reminding', 'how', 'much', 'more', 'theatrical', 'big', 'concerts', 'used', 'be', 'question', 'incredible', 'show', 'watch.The', 'sound', 'picture', 'are', 'good', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'hear', 'flaws', 'sound', 'picture', 'might', 'look', 'somewhat', 'fuzzy', 'times', 'like', 'way', 'TV', 'broadcasts', 'era', 'was', 'shown', 'MTV', 'Halloween', 'night', 'have', 'look', 'vintage', 'feel', 'DVD', 'also', 'booklet', 'cool', 'pictures', 'piece', 'Rudy', 'Sarzo', 'participating', 'tour', 'nice', 'extra.Even', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'moments', 'when', 'Ozzy', 'mouth', 'clearly', ""n't"", 'match', 'up', 'vocals', 'seem', 'real', 'vocals', 'are', 'used', 'time', 'time', 'shouting', 'bantering', 'crowd', 'obviously', 'original', 'audio', 'people', 'have', 'said', 'vocal', 'tracks', 'sound', 'same', 'Tribute', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'are', 'several', 'songs', 'where', 'Ozzy', 'few', 'notes', 'phrasing', 'clearly', 'are', 'not', 'other', 'live', 'releases', 'Overall', ""'m"", 'very', 'happy', 'finally', 'put', 'out', 'officially', 'DVD', 'see', 'must-have', 'hardcore', 'Ozzy', 'fans']",N/A
1538806,A1D7VWS3DWS7X8,B007VP1LQO,Joseph Siegler,"[27, 34]","This is an old school Ozzy concert.  Following the death of Randy Rhoads, Ozzy recruited Bernie Torme to play guitar, but that didn't last terribly long.  To fill out the rest of the concert dates, Ozzy brought in Brad Gillis to play guitar with the band that was already in place.  The lineup here is:Ozzy Osbourne - VocalsBrad Gillis - GuitarRudy Sarzo - BassTommy Aldridge - DrumsDon Airey - KeyboardsJohn Allen - The Dwarf (hey, it's in the credits!)When you look at all the combinations that have been in Ozzy's solo band over the years, this one isn't usually rated terribly high.  I don't know why, because I thought this was an underrated combination.  Given the year this was recorded (1982), the track listing is solely off Ozzy's first two solo albums, and the usual handful of Black Sabbath tracks thrown in there.  I suppose the backlash against this lineup came later on, because I remember when this first came out, it was all over MTV in 1983, and those of us who were lucky enough to have VCR's back then recorded it.  My old VHS copy is long since gone, so I'm glad that this came out finally so I can relive those memories.  Brad Gillis has a style that isn't terribly like Randy Rhoads, Tony Iommi, or Ozzy's later guitarists (Jake, Gus, or Zakk in particular).  But I remember being a fan when this was the incumbent incarnation, and I really liked it.  Plus in 1983, you don't have the absolute glut of available video you do these days, and this video was pretty much all you could get if you wanted to see an Ozzy concert on your TV.Brad later went on to a long career with Night Ranger after this (and could be where some of the backlash came from, as ""Sister Christian"" tainted their image).  Don Airey played with everyone under the sun, and is now a member of Deep Purple.  Rudy played with a bunch of people over the years as well, most notably Blue Oyster Cult & Dio.  Tommy also played with a bunch of others (Whitesnake (with Rudy), Gary Moore, & Thin Lizzy.  So this lineup has done a lot, they weren't scrubs at all.Check out this video, it brings back a lot of good memories for me, and is a great video.A few notes about the actual DVD.  It's pretty bare bones.  On the disc is the concert, and that's it.  No extras of any kind.  It runs 78 minutes, and has some audio selections (5.1, DTS, 2.0 Stereo).Full Track Listing:IntroOver the MountainMr. CrowleyCrazy TrainRevelation (Mother Earth)Steal Away (The Night)Suicide SolutionGuitar SoloDrum SoloGoodbye to RomanceI Don't KnowBelieverFlying High AgainIron ManChildren of the GraveParanoid (Encore)One final note - Tommy Aldridge in his drum solo does a thing he's known for - that's a ""no sticks"" drum solo where he plays the solo with just his hands; no drumsticks.The concert is a good one, and the price is pretty cheap, so it's worth a pickup for someone who is into Sabbath & Ozzy.

Let me see...checking my list, checking it twice....yep, 5 stars.  Seriously, though, this is a great concert.  I actually saw this tour, with this exact lineup, back in Ann Arbor, MI when they actually used to do concerts at Crisler Center (where the University of Michigan plays basketball). They no longer do concerts in that venue, and one of the reasons, I am told, is because the place was totally trashed after that concert!  What a great show, though.  I was just a young kid at the time, and I remember all of the hoopla surrounding Ozzy at the time, such as biting the bat, etc, that made him downright scary to me.  Throw in the midget and I was terrified!  Enjoyed every second of it, though, and this DVD is great for the memories and well worth getting for any fan of Ozzy, whether you saw the actual tour or not.P.S. - the terror factor wore off over the years, and ""The Osbournes"" show totally killed that aspect of it, but Ozzy still rocks!

1538811,ASEBTBA4CZ0X6,B007VP1LQO,T.,"[30, 32]","Its nice that this show has finally been released on DVD. The stage set is a historic one and great to be preserved on video. Just a shame that it wasn't filmed with Randy Rhoads on lead guitar, who just missed this filming. How great would that have been.The good: the stage set and show. Tommy Aldridge on drums. Rudy Sarzo on bass (although he has a one-dimensional stage presence, just bobbing his head and licking his fingers...it does get old after awhile). Brad Gillis does a good job on guitar, considering how fast he was thrown in there and had to learn the complex material. His guitar tone gets annoying after awhile, but he's still fun to watch. Also the camera doesn't dart all over the place a gazillion times a minute like alot of newer filmed concerts do. (i dont' know why they insist on editing alot of newer concerts that way...they're nearly unwatchable because of it).Now for the bad: For anyone that thinks Ozzy sounds good....those vocals have been fixed up and over-dubbed. Big time. This isn't new. It was done way back right after it was filmed, so all the VHS and other releases feature this too. At times, its painful to look at because the overdubbed vocals are so OBVIOUS. On occasion, Ozzy's mouth is moving after the vocals stop, and vice-versa. On the real concert tape of this show, Ozzy sounds HORRIBLE.All in all, still a good release, although not a great one due to the overdubbed and studio fixups afterward and the great Randy Rhoads not being involved (although there's nothing anyone can do about that).Hopefully they release the ""Bark at the Moon"" 1984 Salt Lake City show thats floating around right now on bootleg DVD. That show is much better than this one with even a better stage show to boot...not to mention the great Jake E Lee on guitar. Thats a 4/5 star show. I would give this one a solid 2 1/2 stars.",3,good for a piece of history.
