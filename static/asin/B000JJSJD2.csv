I'll just say it, it's a terrible movie!First of all, anyone who hated Bob Saget doing his stupid voice-overs during ""America's Funniest Home Videos"" should just go ahead and skip this film. It's written, directed, and partially voiced by Bob Saget, and while there are a few noteworthy stars (such as Christina Applegate, Dane Cook, Tracy Morgan, and Samuel L. Jackson) who have lent their voices to this movie, it was not enough to save the movie from the depths of movie hell (where all the bad movies go).Let's address the issues with this film: The humor was stupid, and raunchy (which, don't get me wrong, I enjoy raunchy humor sometimes too, but it just didn't work for this film). The movie is pretty much nothing but stock footage of penguins alla ""March of the Penguins"" that was edited together into a really vague story (and not a very good one at that).

I'm well aware the Bob Saget is dirty comic, but I was expecting something at the very least a little funny.

I just sat there wondering if I was missing something, but the others in the room assured me I wasn't. It was that bad. I never just stop a movie or walk out on it, but this one I was really tempted to do just that. Very poor narration by Samuel L. Jackson seemed painfully out of place, it would have far funnier if they used a one of those nature show narrator to add to the juxtaposition of the concept. The script was boring and reminded me of the dumb little video bits they did on America's Funniest Animals also with Bob Saget. It was just one of those dumb little video bit drug out for a entire movie, spiced up with bathroom and blue humor to I guess to entertain adults.

1027016,ACEA95FQS1AVP,B000JJSJD2,Jem,"[3, 3]","Amazon's review is pretty spot on.  I lovedMarch of the Penguins (Widescreen Edition).  So, the idea of spoofing the hit documentary was a good one.  How funny would it be to hear what those penguins are thinking?  ""My feet hurt."" ""Are we there yet?"" ""Seventy miles to get laid?""  Maybe singing 99 Bottles of Beer?  But, this good idea was wasted.The movie focused on the crude - there's a LOT of profanity, and sexually explicit jokes.  I was expecting that.  But, that's all there is.  The opportunity for less crass humor was completely ignored, so the film essentially becomes a one-liner, over and over again.  Marcus, the ""black"" penguin, is an almost painful clich&eacute; - he's got a big penis, the ladies love him and he drops the f-bomb every other word.  Funny for a minute or two,  but after that beyond boring.  The love story, dragged out ad infinitum by songs, was overdone.  Samuel L. Jackson was a great choice as narrator - a huge contrast with Morgan Freeman.  And when Gilbert Gottfried's penguin tells him that ""Morgan Freeman has more talent in a freckle on his a@@"" it's laugh out loud funny.  But, such moments are few and far between.I think what's most frustrating about this film is watching the extra features.  Bob Saget gathered a HUGE cast of recognizable talent to do tiny bit parts and main parts (a few didn't even make it into the film).  The extras show a lot of very funny lines that were recorded but edited out of the final film - not surprisingly, those lines didn't warrant the R rating.  The ""deleted scenes"" were better than the movie!  It's as though Saget decided he wanted to do Eddie Murphy's Raw instead of Bill Cosby.  Using both would have made this film a real winner, and worth re-watching.  As it is, about 15 minutes of the movie is funny - the other 60 minutes drags out those 15.

1027017,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B000JJSJD2,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[13, 13]","Though it may look like a cute, animated penguin movie, Farce of the Penguins' isn't for kids. It's Bob Saget's classic, surprisingly crude humor--pretty much all of which revolves around sex (and, occasionally, fart jokes). Think of it as 'Animal Planet' meets 'American Pie' or you can see it as a foul mouthed send up of the 'March of the Penguins.'The concept of 'Farce of the Penguins' is priceless. There isn't a single shot of original photography used. It's all stock photography, pieced together and worked into a script that's voiced by just about everyone in Hollywood (or at least those who owed Bob Saget a favor). There's no fancy animation, no special effects. While I definitely appreciate the creativity behind it, though, the story is pretty rough. Some of the jokes get really old after a while--and the 80-minute movie could have easily ended after 60.While there are some great parts to 'Farce of the Penguins' (like the penguins who wander off and end up victims of Global Warming--or Juan Sanchez, the penguin who loses his mind and goes off on an adventure), watching it often feels like being on the outside of a very detailed inside joke. Though I'm sure it was really funny in the studio--when everyone was hanging around, recording the voices--it's pretty clear that you just had to be there to appreciate parts of it. So the best part of the DVD is actually the making-of feature, which shows the voice talent in the studio, recording their parts.

The penguins talk, Carl, Jimmy & Marcus played by the voices of Bob Saget, Lewis Black & Tracy Morgan. Samuel Jackson does the Morgan Freeman part, the narration. A dozen other voices that you'll recognize. It  covers the penguin life cycle. The endless marching, eating, marching, mating & birth of the next generation & again marching. Profanity laced jokes abound on food, sore feet, sex, the  meaning of life, love etc. Bob Saget is breaking out of his mold of sugary sweet sit-com star & game host.

Therefore, I wasn't sure what to expect from this satire on such a moving and well-made film.  Well, I was pleasantly surprised.  Yes, it pokes fun in some places at the plight, albeit a chosen plight, at some of the real-life penguins, but all-in-all, this animated feature is just plain fun and funny.  Anyone who has seen March of the Penguins was made aware of the cleverness, endurance and caring nature of these beautiful creatures, and Farce of the Penguins shows the same clever, enduring and caring nature, yet in a lighthearted and, at many times, hysterical way.I will say one thing.  This movie is definitely not for children.  It really is an adult-oriented animated film due to some of the language and sexual content.  Remember, this is an animated film with animated penguins, so I wouldn't go so far as to say it was raunchy or filthy, but it had some very suggestive scenes.  I will say that if you are looking for a movie that will make you laugh your butt off after the kids are in bed, this is the film for you.
