1265170,A3MFORLOKIOEQY,B002ECJZ76,Amazon Customer,"[1, 1]","I wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered this film. I'm glad I did - it is a nice story, with some unusual twists. I watched this with the family, my 10 year old son and 12 year old daughter, and my wife.Pro:The basic story itself was very touching, about a boy in a Lapland (Finland) village, and how he come to be a Santa Claus figure. At several points during the movie I found my self very, very moved. The plot was excellent - up to the ending. One characteristic of a great movie is that you can see the direction the plot is going - but are still interested even though it develops more or less as expected. This is that sort of movie.The character development was a bit obvious, but was still so good that I rate it excellent. The actor chosen as ""Santa"" really looks the part as well.Much of the scenery is just breathtaking, and the photography is excellent. You can really feel the cold.Con:I won't give away the ending, but it was very unexpected. I kept wondering how they writers were going to wrap up the nice story such that we found out how the main character became the beloved Santa Claus we all know. I never found out - this is a case where the writers must have realized that they'd written themselves into a corner with the plot. So they took an easy out. It brought smiles to everyone's faces, so maybe it works after all. Honestly, it had everyone laughing out loud, a sort of ""oh no, they didn't do THAT"" moment. But I would have liked a bit of Christmas magic.Ok, not since the bad Chinese flicks of the 1970's has there been such a bad dubbing job. I suppose that Finnish (or whatever the language is called) must be a real jaw-breaker of a language, because the English translations generally finished a second or so before the characters on screen stopped moving their lips. Honestly, I think the movie would be better with subtitles, so we could hear the actual words. It would have made the film better.Conclusion:Excellent Christmas movie, and I recommend it for families. There are some life circumstances (deaths due to cold, never on screen), but they are handled realistically and with compassion.",4,Heartwarming with some laughs,1259107200,"11 25, 2009",2009,2137,"['was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'when', 'ordered', 'film', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'nice', 'story', 'unusual', 'twists', 'watched', 'family', '10', 'year', 'old', 'son', '12', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'wife.Pro', 'basic', 'story', 'was', 'very', 'touching', 'boy', 'Lapland', 'Finland', 'village', 'how', 'come', 'be', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'figure', 'several', 'points', 'movie', 'found', 'self', 'very', 'very', 'moved', 'plot', 'was', 'excellent', 'up', 'ending', 'One', 'characteristic', 'great', 'movie', 'can', 'see', 'direction', 'plot', 'going', 'are', 'still', 'interested', 'even', 'more', 'expected', 'sort', 'movie.The', 'character', 'development', 'was', 'bit', 'obvious', 'was', 'still', 'so', 'good', 'rate', 'excellent', 'actor', 'chosen', 'Santa', 'really', 'part', 'well.Much', 'scenery', 'just', 'breathtaking', 'photography', 'excellent', 'can', 'really', 'feel', 'cold.Con', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'ending', 'was', 'very', 'unexpected', 'kept', 'wondering', 'how', 'writers', 'were', 'going', 'wrap', 'up', 'nice', 'story', 'such', 'found', 'out', 'how', 'main', 'character', 'became', 'beloved', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'know', 'never', 'found', 'out', 'case', 'where', 'writers', 'must', 'have', 'realized', ""'d"", 'written', 'corner', 'plot', 'took', 'easy', 'out', 'brought', 'smiles', 'everyone', 'so', 'maybe', 'Honestly', 'had', 'everyone', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'sort', 'oh', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'moment', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'bit', 'Christmas', 'magic.Ok', 'not', 'bad', 'Chinese', 'flicks', '1970', 'there', 'been', 'bad', 'dubbing', 'job', 'suppose', 'Finnish', 'whatever', 'language', 'called', 'must', 'be', 'real', 'jaw-breaker', 'language', 'English', 'translations', 'generally', 'finished', 'second', 'so', 'characters', 'screen', 'stopped', 'moving', 'lips', 'Honestly', 'think', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'subtitles', 'could', 'hear', 'actual', 'words', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'film', 'better.Conclusion', 'Excellent', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'recommend', 'families', 'are', 'life', 'circumstances', 'deaths', 'due', 'cold', 'never', 'screen', 'are', 'handled', 'realistically', 'compassion']",N/A

1265172,A3OT6IQ0YHGDCB,B002ECJZ76,"ANT ""azraelart""","[0, 1]","I was a bit nervous about viewing this film at first, since I wasn't sure what they were going to do to the backstory of Santa Claus, a figure so entrenched in mystique and history that it was brave enough to even contemplate this tale.  Still, the end result surprised me, and the ride to the end was well worth it.I'm almost unwilling to write about any of the plot, lest I take anything away from this film for you.  That is to say, I do highly recommend that you give it a viewing, although you might want to screen it first before showing it to younger children.  Gauge whether or not you feel they should see it themselves, as there are some sad scenes and a brief amount of Scrooge-like characters who might frighten the very impressionable.Still, the story is simple enough.  Santa Claus begins the narration by telling us he wasn't always the figure of legend that he is now.  He had a life, too, and used to be a child like every one of us.  Growing up in Finland, though (assumedly), was not easy for young Nikolas.  On Christmas, he loses some people very close to him and make it his mission to repay those who have helped him in his youth.  The story continues from there into his adult life, and I really don't want to give anything away, but I will say that it seems to be a rather revealing tale of life many years ago growing up in a Finnish fishing village.The cinematography caught my eye quite often, and early on, there was one scene that nearly bowled me over entirely with it's subtle emotion.  I don't even know if everyone would react the same way, as it was quite mundane, but in its simplicity it evoked a strong reaction with me.  Young Nikolas is bringing in a crate of some supplies (not really shown what, maybe fish, maybe produce), and his 'mother' is working in the kitchen.  A fire is roaring in the hearth and she is making some kind of bread or pastry.  Apples are about the place, simple tools and foodstuffs adorn the room, and simple folks enjoy a very simple hug, but therein reveal an intense amount of emotion towards each other.  This one scene alone (pretty early in) was extremely well shot, well placed, and very well done overall.  The rest of the movie does not disappoint, either.The ending might be a bit of a stretch, but if one has the imagination to read into it, and see it for the portrayal its going for, then it is equally enjoyable and well placed in the overall scheme of the movie.  The acting is superb, the costuming is incredible, and the script is both easy to follow (especially for kids) and well-written.  So, why only four stars?First problem: dubbed.  Perhaps it was my copy, but I don't think it is available directly in the US in anything other than dubbed audio.  I was hoping to opt for Finnish dialogue (original, I believe) with English subtitles, but this was not available.  I firmly disliked dubbed audio and it took me a good 10-15 minutes into the movie before I finally stopped noticing... for the most part.Second problem: end credits.  After a very favorable and appropriate soundtrack (some beautiful flutey pieces and orchestral numbers), the editor or director decided to leave the story and go straight into hard rock!  This was also one of the only times that there was no dubbing, so I can't honestly tell you if the music is even appropriate to the movie or not!  Very confounding to say the least, but ultimately, not enough to detract from the overall charm and beauty of this film.Overall, I would definitely recommend this to anyone who still loves Santa Claus and Christmas, both the films and the person/season.  It definitely is not as funny as the other movie with the similar name (""A Christmas Story""), but I think it will stand the test of time.  Find a copy with original audio and English subtitles (if needed) and you'll be in great shape, then!  That is, of course, if dubbed audio bugs you as it does myself.  Still, a great movie, one that should eventually be talked about more and more during the holiday season, and a must-own for Christmas/Santa lovers everywhere!",4,"Charming, heart-warming, and utterly enjoyable!",1265932800,"02 12, 2010",2010,4077,"['was', 'bit', 'nervous', 'viewing', 'film', 'first', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'were', 'going', 'do', 'backstory', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'figure', 'so', 'entrenched', 'mystique', 'history', 'was', 'brave', 'enough', 'even', 'contemplate', 'tale', 'Still', 'end', 'result', 'surprised', 'ride', 'end', 'was', 'well', 'worth', 'it.I', ""'m"", 'almost', 'unwilling', 'write', 'plot', 'lest', 'take', 'anything', 'away', 'film', 'say', 'do', 'highly', 'recommend', 'give', 'viewing', 'might', 'want', 'screen', 'first', 'showing', 'younger', 'children', 'Gauge', 'not', 'feel', 'should', 'see', 'are', 'sad', 'scenes', 'brief', 'amount', 'Scrooge-like', 'characters', 'who', 'might', 'frighten', 'very', 'impressionable.Still', 'story', 'simple', 'enough', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'narration', 'telling', 'was', ""n't"", 'always', 'figure', 'legend', 'now', 'had', 'life', 'too', 'used', 'be', 'child', 'one', 'Growing', 'up', 'Finland', 'assumedly', 'was', 'not', 'easy', 'young', 'Nikolas', 'Christmas', 'people', 'very', 'close', 'make', 'mission', 'repay', 'who', 'have', 'helped', 'youth', 'story', 'adult', 'life', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'anything', 'away', 'will', 'say', 'be', 'rather', 'revealing', 'tale', 'life', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'growing', 'up', 'Finnish', 'fishing', 'village.The', 'cinematography', 'caught', 'eye', 'quite', 'often', 'early', 'was', 'one', 'scene', 'nearly', 'bowled', 'over', 'entirely', 'subtle', 'emotion', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'everyone', 'would', 'react', 'same', 'way', 'was', 'quite', 'mundane', 'simplicity', 'evoked', 'strong', 'reaction', 'Young', 'Nikolas', 'bringing', 'crate', 'supplies', 'not', 'really', 'shown', 'what', 'maybe', 'fish', 'maybe', 'produce', ""'mother"", 'working', 'kitchen', 'fire', 'roaring', 'hearth', 'making', 'kind', 'bread', 'pastry', 'Apples', 'are', 'place', 'simple', 'tools', 'foodstuffs', 'adorn', 'room', 'simple', 'folks', 'enjoy', 'very', 'simple', 'hug', 'therein', 'reveal', 'intense', 'amount', 'emotion', 'towards', 'other', 'one', 'scene', 'alone', 'pretty', 'early', 'was', 'extremely', 'well', 'shot', 'well', 'placed', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'overall', 'rest', 'movie', 'not', 'disappoint', 'either.The', 'ending', 'might', 'be', 'bit', 'stretch', 'one', 'imagination', 'read', 'see', 'portrayal', 'going', 'then', 'equally', 'enjoyable', 'well', 'placed', 'overall', 'scheme', 'movie', 'acting', 'superb', 'costuming', 'incredible', 'script', 'easy', 'follow', 'especially', 'kids', 'well-written', 'So', 'why', 'only', 'four', 'stars', 'First', 'problem', 'dubbed', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'copy', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'available', 'directly', 'US', 'anything', 'other', 'dubbed', 'audio', 'was', 'hoping', 'opt', 'Finnish', 'dialogue', 'original', 'believe', 'English', 'subtitles', 'was', 'not', 'available', 'firmly', 'disliked', 'dubbed', 'audio', 'took', 'good', '10-15', 'minutes', 'movie', 'finally', 'stopped', 'noticing', 'most', 'part.Second', 'problem', 'end', 'credits', 'very', 'favorable', 'appropriate', 'soundtrack', 'beautiful', 'flutey', 'pieces', 'orchestral', 'numbers', 'editor', 'director', 'decided', 'leave', 'story', 'go', 'straight', 'hard', 'rock', 'was', 'also', 'one', 'only', 'times', 'was', 'dubbing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'honestly', 'tell', 'music', 'even', 'appropriate', 'movie', 'not', 'Very', 'confounding', 'say', 'least', 'ultimately', 'not', 'enough', 'detract', 'overall', 'charm', 'beauty', 'film.Overall', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'still', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'Christmas', 'films', 'person/season', 'definitely', 'not', 'as', 'funny', 'other', 'movie', 'similar', 'name', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Story', 'think', 'will', 'stand', 'test', 'time', 'Find', 'copy', 'original', 'audio', 'English', 'subtitles', 'needed', ""'ll"", 'be', 'great', 'shape', 'then', 'course', 'dubbed', 'audio', 'bugs', 'Still', 'great', 'movie', 'one', 'should', 'eventually', 'be', 'talked', 'more', 'more', 'holiday', 'season', 'must-own', 'Christmas/Santa', 'lovers', 'everywhere']",N/A

I was pleasantly surprised, however, when it exceeded my expectations.  Once I got used to the often sloppy dubbing, I really enjoyed this film about the boyhood of Nikolas, who grew up to become the person we know as Santa Claus. Young Nikolas is orphaned at a young age and is taken to a village whose residents raise him like a foster child, going from home to home, until he eventually ends up with rather cruel guardian named Iisakki.  But Nikolas has a penchant for carving little wooden toys and leaving them on doorsteps on Christmas Eve, and once he is put to work in Iisakki's woodworking shop... well, the rest, as they say, is history.  It's a charming, believable and gently sentimental fantasy, well-acted and appropriate for all ages (though probably best appreciated by children 8 and up), with beautiful cinematography and even a decent music soundtrack.

The film starts out very slowly, taking almost 15 minutes to captivate. Once that introductory hump is passed, this is a wonderful, beautiful, heartwarming movie. This ends up being a really sweet movie.Not all is perfect with this film. The Scandinavians understand something essential, if they want to do business with the world, they have to speak English; otherwise they will simply talk with 2 or 3 million others that speak that one unique language. This film was dubbed in English, the actors all spoke Finnish when they shot this film. Post-production equally decent actors spoke the English sound track. There is no way to sync sound and mouth movements with two unrelated languages, (to think that is even remotely possible is ludicrous).The downside to this film, there are only two soundtracks, English in 5.1 and English in 2 channel stereo. There is no Finnish soundtrack. There are no subtitles period, not even for hearing impaired. The production company blew this DVD; a choice would have been good.The acting is wonderful. Nikolas at all ages is believable. The makeup was not good, as people aged, that failing was more apparent. This movie was shot in some of the most inhospitable places in the world. They shot in 35 below zero weather. It stands to reason that the snow in the film is real, nothing sprayed on. Sadly, we've gotten so used to Hollywood's version of snowfall, that the real thing now looks horribly fake. People actually had rime ice on their beards and mustaches. You could feel the cold in the film.This is an all age's film. Lisakki is supposed to be an evil horrible man, a la Scrooge, that mistreats Nikolas. In reality he is simply very particular and demanding about work. Nikolas is never mistreated, at least not on camera. He is expected to do a good job, but nothing outlandish. Saturday morning programs have much worse in them. In the end, this is a wonderful warm movie.I didn't know what to expect from this film. I love Scandinavian film, and thought this had potential to retell a story we all think we know. I loved this version of the St. Nikolas story, it made so much sense.

Of course, with a variety of different stories of where the origination of ""Santa Claus"" came from, in ""Christmas Story"", the film revolves around a boy named Nikolas who lives in a small village where most of the surroundings is ice and snow.One night, Nikolas's parents had to leave him at home as they had to bring their daughter Aada to the doctor because she was sick.  Because they had to leave Nikolas (who was 7-years-old) home alone with enough food and firewood for a few days, the parents took a short cut.  But with the parents not arriving back home, Nikolas receives the tragic news that his family fell under ice and died during their trip to the doctor.  Now an orphan, Nikolas is brought to the main village where a few families live.But with everyone with their own families and money tight, the village elder and the families agree that Nikolas will live with one family and on Christmas day, he will move to the next family.  During his time with each family, to show his gratitude, Nikolas would use his father's knife to carve out animals or toys from wood, which he would then give to the kids of families of the homes where he stayed at.For the most part, things went well for the next six years...that is until food became more difficult for each family to obtain.  Because of this, families are no longer able to take in Nikolas.But one day, a mean salesperson named lisakki, a man that literally scares the children has come to the village.  Nikolas who doesn' t know why people are scared, gives lisakki one of his wooden toys.  lisakki doesn't believe a young boy could make such a thing but learning that he has no place to live, he takes Nikolas in.Of course, lisakki is quite mean to Nikolas but gives him a place to live and clean up the workshop.  While lisakki is sleeping, Nikolas would continue making wooden toys for the kids at his village which he wanted to make sure he continued to give as gifts for appreciation.It becomes a routine for Nikolas and as he gets older, he wants to give back to children not just in his original village but also in other villages as well.  So, throughout the film, we see how the young boy grows up along with his guardian lisakki and suddenly becomes a man who has the long beard and dons a red suit, why he uses reindeer to pull his sled and why its so important for him to deliver toys to the children in different villages.VIDEO & AUDIO:""Christmas Story"" is presented in Anamorphic Widescreen (2:35:1).  For the most part, the film looks absolutely beautiful as most of the film is shot in a small village and we can see homes in the middle of nothing but snow and trees.  The cold, winter weather was captured quite amazing on camera and was not CG'd.  the cast and crew had to bare harsh conditions to make this film because a lot of the electrical equipment had difficulty working in cold weather and the wiring would easily snap because of the cold weather.  But the scenes overlooking the mountains, snow covered trees, varying seasons during the fall and winter.  Simply put, Mika Orasmaa's cinematography is amazing and beautiful.Audio is presented in English Dolby Surround 5.1 and 2.0 and for me, this is probably the most disappoint part of the DVD.  The English dub was well, but I prefer to watch this film in its original Finnish dialogue.  It's quite interesting because the special feature features the dialogue in Finnish.  For the most part, dubbed dialogue is clear and understandable.  I didn't notice the surround channels being used all that much but the film is pretty much center and front channel driven.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Christmas Story"" comes with the following special features:* ""The Making of Christmas Story"" - (21:57) the cast and crew talk about the challenge of making this film in the extreme cold (a lot of the equipment would not work in the intense cold and the wires would snap like branches because of the cold weather).  We learn about the scene location and certain scenes that were shot (and cut) from the film.* Christmas Story Trailer - (1:16) The theatrical trailer for ""Christmas Story"".JUDGMENT CALL:Overall, ""Christmas Story"" was an enjoyable holiday film.  The film would make a good family film but children under 6-years-old, that's a tough call because it is a PG film and some children might get scared of how lisakki treats young Nikolas and the fact that there are dramatic scenes in the film.I enjoyed ""Christmas Story"" and the special feature was very interesting to watch, especially to see how difficult it was to shoot the film due to the weather conditions.  But I have to say that I was very disappointed that Anchor Bay Entertainment did not include the Finnish audio track and English subtitles to accompany it.  We've come to a point in time where many people who are getting exposed to international films want to enjoy a film spoken in the original language.  And the fact that it's not included on this DVD is disappointing.Yet, it's hard for me to dislike the film because the cinematography is beautiful and I did enjoy the film because although it does feature Santa Claus, it was an intriguing take on how Nikolas became Santa Claus .  ""Christmas Story"" is an entertaining holiday film...and if you have been watching the same Christmas films for the last few decades, its something different this time around.Overall, if you can overlook the DVD not including the original spoken dialogue, then ""Christmas Story"" is definitely a holiday film worth checking out.",3,A good holiday film with beautiful cinematography but the DVD

The story of old Saint Nick told from Finland perspective is a marvelous story that is sweet, but never sappy and really belies the whole Holiday film clich&eacute;.The story of Santa Claus is told as if we are watching a biography. The film gets my highest 5 star rating, but the DVD gets one star deducted for sloppy dubbing and no original language option. The film would have been better if it ended about a minute sooner too. The shot of the spirit Santa Claus driving off in his sleigh just seemed out of place in this otherwise very engrossing and heartwarming film. I know, I know...it's a ""holiday movie"", but this film is so much more than that and I think it would have spoken louder and been more profound had it showed us a little less.This is a small grievance and the film will be in my yearly holiday viewing repertoire for years to come. The film runs about an hour and 20 minutes and shows you don't have to have an overly long film to develop characters or tell a complete story!

This constantly snowdrifted little movie is a fictionalized account of how an orphan child with a knack for woodcarving became the legendary bringer of presents -- and while it sometimes loses its depth in pursuit of the Santa Claus legend, it's a sweet, warm-hearted little movie with the aesthetics of a storybook.Nikolas' (Jonas Rinne) parents and baby sister are killed in a sleigh accident when he's young, and nobody in the village can afford to adopt the quiet boy. So the village families come up with a plan: Nikolas will be passed from family to family over the next six years, with each transition being at Christmas. And since Nikolas has a knack for carving wood, every Christmas he leaves toys on the doorstep of the families who once showed him kindness.Then at thirteen (played by Otto Gustavsson), he's handed off to Isaac (Kari V&auml;&auml;n&auml;nen), a crotchety and cruel carpenter who initially treats him like a slave. But after Isaac discovers Nikolas' secret, he begins to warm to the strange, generous boy. And as Nikolas grows to manhood (Hannu-Pekka Bj&ouml;rkman), he's left with a remote, frozen house and a workshop filled with toys -- and a dream that he's determined to make real, bringing countless children toys every Christmas.""Christmas Story"" (original title: ""Joulutarina"") is a refreshing experience in a sea of schmaltzy made-for-TV movies and stupid Christmas comedies. It has a mellow homespun charm reflected in the poverty-stricken fishing village, log houses and layers of woolly clothing -- and there's no preachy message about the true meaning of Christmas (love/family/generosity/all that), just Nikolas displaying it as he slowly morphs into Santa Claus.It's also pretty as a picture -- while there are some lovely shots of autumnal forests and fog-wrapped fishing boats, the real draw is the gorgeous pictures of little Finnish villages under a perpetual blanket of snow. The overall mood is an upbeat one, with a pleasant study of how the basic trappings of the popular fictional Santa Claus (the hat, the reindeer, the sleigh, the gifts) became a part of his legend. But it becomes darker and sadder as the lonely, generous man winds through the latter years of his life, only to have another upturn at the end.One thing that is a problem: there is no Finnish soundtrack in this movie, just English subs and an English audio track dubbed by people who often didn't sound too enthusiastic. It actually was sometimes more fun to watch the movie with the sound turned off.The child actors are thoroughly mediocre, but Bj&ouml;rkman really throws himself wholeheartedly into his role -- he's jolly, generous and thoroughly devoted to his new goal. And he's got a beard that could The only problem is that when Nikolas reaches adulthood, his motives become rather murky -- it's not quite clear WHY he becomes so determined to devote his life to Christmas, toymaking and all kids in the region.And while most of the actors are only briefly in the story, the few who stand out are excellent V&auml;&auml;n&auml;nen gives a well-drawn performance as Isaac, who makes you hate his character, then pity him, then want to hug him; Mikko Kouki is quite good as Nikolas' best buddy.""Christmas Story's"" English dub hampers it, but that can't erase some solid acting, lovely scenery, and a pleasant little made-up story about Santa Claus' origins.

1265186,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B002ECJZ76,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[0, 0]","OK, OK, the title is a bit much and not funny. CHRISTMAS STORY (original Finnish title ""Joulutarina"", 2007) was as heart-warming and old-fashioned fun film as I've seen ere these long years. Purporting to tell the story of the origins of ""Father Christmas"", it glides as smoothly as a sleigh over a frozen Russian lake. It is neither maudlin nor childish- it is a good story and the acting isn't bad.I can't say enough about my enthusiasm for Finn and Lapp film. I've recently seen one film from each country, and I can't get enough. Sadly, either the Finns don't want us to learn their tongue or Hollyweird is at it again: CHRISTMAS is the second Finnish film I've seen that has taken immense trouble to dub over the actors. This one features John Turturro as one of the 'voice-overs', and all the actors who dubbed are credited alongside the realtime actors.That is one thing I hate, hate, hate and I especially wish they had not done it here. Finnish seems beautiful to me, but I never get to hear enough of it.Still, the story is beautiful and plausible, starting with Santa as a wee boy who loses his whole family. He's raised by the village and shows his deep gratitude by delivering hand-carved animal totems to them as presents. This he does under cover of darkness, apparently to avoid embarrassment. Hannu-Pekka Bj&ouml;rkman is a goofy charmer as the adult Nikolas, soon to gain fame as ""Father Christmas"".If I may be forgiven, the Finnish-Lapp names are just too much for me- I'll be leaving them out of this!This film is overall ingenious. I won't spoil it because for me it was full of surprises that can teach America a thing or two about logic and continuity. This film is a marvel in that it is 100% family-oriented, and quite magical without smacking of Harry Potter. The Finnish fishing village, I'd guess offhand the date is around 1400 A.D., is a marvel. What I love most is the restraint and mature approach this movie takes: it could easily have turned out to be the most horrid film in history.It is a beautiful movie and I highly recommend it for the holidays... even if you aren't Christian.

Melillo ""gloriana""","[1, 1]","Many adults who believe in Santa Claus, myself included, will be pleasantly surprised to see the version of Santa in whom they believe captured superbly in this film. Where many variations on the Santa Claus theme, so numerous in recent decades, are flamboyant or silly, Christmas Story presents powerful themes which one may ponder. It is an entertaining and engrossing film - though those who are seeking a 'magical' Santa will not find him here. Christmas Story captures the essence of generosity and compassion in giving, and subtly treats of such other elements of life as dealing with sorrow, the essential goodness in those who are misjudged, and community involvement in caring for those who are in serious need.At the outset, there is much with which young Nicholas must deal - the story begins with the death of his parents and only sister, with elements of poverty, communal difficulties when crops and fishing fail also treated. Much of the plot concerns Nicholas' apprenticeship as a carpenter, with 'crazy Isaac' (actually a concerned and generous man) who at first seems a rough taskmaster. One can see, in both characters, the strong and critical theme which underlies all of the action: Nicholas and Isaac's suffering has not been wasted, because it has given them true compassion for others.The film has no religious references - Christmas is treated solely in relation to giving, and Nicholas has no connection with the legendary bishop. Neither is it magical - the reindeer and red suit are used for practical reasons, and one will find no North Pole toy shop nor elves. Nicholas is a man who embraces giving, and whose generosity continues. I mention this in part because it could be disappointing to anyone who was looking for all elements which have sprung up in the Santa Claus of popular culture. :)I would highly recommend this film to adults and children who are school aged. Little ones would be unlikely to understand the themes at all, might be puzzled by this version of Santa Claus (which those of riper years may find as appealing as did I), and might be troubled by some of the early action. There is no violence at all, and the characters featured are anywhere from good to extraordinary, but the early tragedies might be troubling to those as yet unaware of the pains of life, though that such can have a positive, even enriching, outcome is stressed throughout.Christmas Story can get one to thinking - and can be an instrument of getting one to appreciate the compassion and gratitude which inform a true spirit of giving.",5,Here is a Santa Claus in whom we can truly believe,1259107200,"11 25, 2009",2009,2560,"['Many', 'adults', 'who', 'believe', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'included', 'will', 'be', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'see', 'version', 'Santa', 'whom', 'believe', 'captured', 'superbly', 'film', 'Where', 'many', 'variations', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'theme', 'so', 'numerous', 'recent', 'decades', 'are', 'flamboyant', 'silly', 'Christmas', 'Story', 'presents', 'powerful', 'themes', 'one', 'may', 'ponder', 'entertaining', 'engrossing', 'film', 'who', 'are', 'seeking', ""'magical"", 'Santa', 'will', 'not', 'find', 'here', 'Christmas', 'Story', 'essence', 'generosity', 'compassion', 'giving', 'subtly', 'treats', 'such', 'other', 'elements', 'life', 'dealing', 'sorrow', 'essential', 'goodness', 'who', 'are', 'misjudged', 'community', 'involvement', 'caring', 'who', 'are', 'serious', 'outset', 'much', 'young', 'Nicholas', 'must', 'deal', 'story', 'death', 'parents', 'only', 'sister', 'elements', 'poverty', 'communal', 'difficulties', 'when', 'crops', 'fishing', 'fail', 'also', 'treated', 'Much', 'plot', 'concerns', 'Nicholas', 'apprenticeship', 'carpenter', ""'crazy"", 'Isaac', 'actually', 'concerned', 'generous', 'man', 'who', 'first', 'rough', 'taskmaster', 'One', 'can', 'see', 'characters', 'strong', 'critical', 'theme', 'action', 'Nicholas', 'Isaac', 'suffering', 'not', 'been', 'wasted', 'given', 'true', 'compassion', 'others.The', 'film', 'religious', 'references', 'Christmas', 'treated', 'solely', 'relation', 'giving', 'Nicholas', 'connection', 'legendary', 'bishop', 'magical', 'reindeer', 'red', 'suit', 'are', 'used', 'practical', 'reasons', 'one', 'will', 'find', 'North', 'Pole', 'toy', 'shop', 'elves', 'Nicholas', 'man', 'who', 'giving', 'generosity', 'mention', 'part', 'could', 'be', 'disappointing', 'anyone', 'who', 'was', 'looking', 'elements', 'have', 'sprung', 'up', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'popular', 'culture', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'adults', 'children', 'who', 'are', 'school', 'aged', 'Little', 'ones', 'would', 'be', 'unlikely', 'understand', 'themes', 'might', 'be', 'puzzled', 'version', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'riper', 'years', 'may', 'find', 'as', 'appealing', 'did', 'might', 'be', 'troubled', 'early', 'action', 'violence', 'characters', 'featured', 'are', 'anywhere', 'good', 'extraordinary', 'early', 'tragedies', 'might', 'be', 'troubling', 'yet', 'unaware', 'pains', 'life', 'such', 'can', 'have', 'positive', 'even', 'enriching', 'outcome', 'stressed', 'throughout.Christmas', 'Story', 'can', 'get', 'one', 'thinking', 'can', 'be', 'instrument', 'getting', 'one', 'appreciate', 'compassion', 'gratitude', 'true', 'spirit', 'giving']",N/A

It's not as somber as it sounds, but it's also not a peppy Rankin/Bass look at the legend with happy elves and a colorful workshop.My daughter was only marginally interested in watching this film yet she was drawn in totally by its compelling storytelling and fresh look at the legend. She's 12, so this might be a film for older kids and adults rather than tots. The musical score is fantastic and the photography, filmed on location in Finland, is breathtaking. There's a lengthy bonus feature all about the physical extremes endured by the cast and crew in order to make this unusual film. Interestingly, the cast and filmmakers are subtitled in the documentary so you get to hear some of the voices without the dubbing.The film is dubbed, by quite well, especially by John Turturro as the woodworking master who seems frightening at first and becomes sympathetic later, but always in a very belivable way.

That's a mistake.This is an excellent family film about the origin of Santa Claus. This film transcends the commercial image of Santa and grounds him in a loving story that isn't afraid to make you cry.The word ""classic"" is used too often to describe holiday films, each of lesser and lesser quality. Hollywood has a lousy record when it comes to holiday films over the past decade. For example,The Santa Clause 3 The Escape Clause(2006),Deck the Halls(2006),Christmas With the Kranks(2004),Surviving Christmas(2004), and, most recently,Santa Baby(2007) andFour Christmases(2008). And that doesn't count other holiday lumps of coal starring Tom Arnold, Kelsey Grammer and Matthew McConaughey.My point is that this film, with its snowy lush cinematography and original storyline, isn't without its flaws. However, you will come away feeling inspired by the result, rather than feeling cheated once again by another made-for-TV plot, lame acting and sophomoric humor.Jen Johans' review for Film Intuition does an excellent job of capturing what makes this foreign film so special. The following excerpt nicely sums up why you should give the movie a chance:""However, despite its melancholic opener and general audience reluctance to foreign films, this uplifting PG-rated movie is one I urge parents to seek out to offer a new alternative to the primarily commercial approach of Santa Claus movies.""A beautiful work filled with the ingredients that make our classics including A Christmas Carol, Nutcracker and other holiday movies so endearing, director Juha Wuolijoki's Story also garnered prestigious accolades in time for its DVD debut including a seal of approval by The Dove Foundation and an All-Star honor by the well-respected Kids First!

I was ready for an off-beat, unconventional, un-Americanized story of Santa. I enjoy foreign films very much, and eagerly anticipated watching some fine Finnish acting and dialogue.There are two problems that I shall note:1. The dubbing. (It IS disclosed in the Amazon description that it is dubbed, but I did not see that. I thought nobody dubbed films anymore!) The dubbing undermines the characters, the story, the entire film. I watched the original Finnish behind-the-scenes stuff on the DVD and the original Finnish trailer and got the sense that it was so much better than it could ever be with the dubbing. There is no option for subtitles of any sort. It's the dubbing or nothing. Not only is the dubbing poorly done, but I'm sure there are elements of the story lost in translation.2. The story. To be fair, I have to take into consideration that much of the quality of the story, acting, etc. was lost due to the dubbing. I found the story meandering, uneven, and confusing. I didn't understand how the ending came about. The connections between the characters felt very odd a lot of the time. I don't really understand WHY Nikolas even sacrificed his life to making toys. The children even turn on him at one point, inexplicably. It was all rather bleak and muddling.I will say that the scenery is breathtaking, absolutely. The costume design was lovely. The attempt to filming an unusual story about Santa was a great idea, but I feel it failed. I cannot even recommend this for children. I'm not sure they would like it.

The costumes, the sets, and the art direction are all outstanding, and Mika Orasmaa's cinematography is literally stunning - several times I found myself smiling with childlike delight at the beauty of individual shots and scenes.  Leri Leskinen's musical score also adds to the magical ambience of the film without calling undue attention to itself.  And the performances are all just fine; I think the fact that the actors were all unfamiliar to me leant the film a certain veneer of plausibility.In fact, my only quibble with the DVD presentation of the film is the fact that subtitles were not available.  Instead, the film was dubbed into English ... and a bit poorly, I might add, since the movement of the cast's lips did not always match the dialogue.  This would not have bothered me so much if I were a child - especially a youngster who had not yet learned to read! - but as an adult audience of one, I much would have preferred to have heard the actors' natural voices and read the English translations at the bottom of my screen.That one minor and adult-specific detail aside, I thoroughly enjoyed ""Christmas Story"" and can't wait for the pleasure of watching it with my young godchildren when the holidays roll around again.

1265201,A3EEHMLILVOEMJ,B002ECJZ76,"L. Hartness ""LHartness""","[1, 1]","From Finland comes the somber, touching and memorable origin story of Saint Nicholas.  We know Santa to be a character of great generosity and love, but we generally don't think about his possible childhood.  ""Christmas Story"" or ""Joulutarina"" does a masterful job in spinning this tale.Hundreds of years ago, Nicholas is orphaned and cared for by many in his northern village. He changes homes once a year on Christmas Day.  Eventually he begins sending homemade toys to the children of the families who have cared for him over the years.  At age 13 he's taken in by a grumpy outsider named Isaac, who seems to have no love or compassion in his heart for children.Under Isaac's care Nicholas becomes quite the carpenter, and they eventually become as close as kin. He continues crafting gifts for children around the village, all the while doing it anonymously.  Then the year comes when he begins sharing toys with children from outside his village. He has a desire to bless children not only in his village, but far beyond.There are other touching plot details that give this story depth and meaning never seen before in the Santa mythology.  I've omitted these details so that you may enjoy them as I did.In addition to the excellent writing, the film features beautiful cinematography and an excellent soundtrack.  Although filmed in a Scandinavian language, the voices have been dubbed over in English. Some of the English-language voice actors are John Turturro (""Transformers""), Michael Badalucco (""The Practice"") and Noah Emmerich (""Cellular"").  If you're like me and you also enjoy captions, there are none available on the DVD.  However, I was able to engage the Closed Captioning feature on my TV.Parents:  This film has been approved by The Coalition for Quality Children's Media and The Dove Foundation for quality family entertainment.  The content does not include any sex, nudity, gore or profanity.  There's not really any violence, although the Isaac character does shove young Nicholas' head down onto a dusty table in one scene.  He also calls him ""Brat"" at the beginning of their relationship. Those initial scenes with Isaac might be a bit disturbing for very young children, as he's a bit harsh with Nicholas. The element of dishonesty when it comes to Santa's identity is also a minor issue.  Pairing these and a few other intense (but not terrible) thematic elements with very few incidents of smoking, and the movie has earned a `PG' rating.The running time of the film is about 70 minutes, and there is a 20 minute featurette in the Special Feature section.  This piece is not overdubbed and you'll need to read the subtitles.While there aren't many moments of levity in this film, I would not characterize it as depressing.  It's a rich tale, one that should have been told years ago.  The power of love, compassion and sharing is evident, transforming the lives of those in Nicholas' life.  Hopefully many will emulate Nicholas, loving the unlovable and even sharing blessings with those who haven't been a blessing.  Truly, the message of unconditional, grace-filled love is at the very core of the true meaning of Christmas.",4,Wonderful origin story,1259280000,"11 27, 2009",2009,3156,"['Finland', 'somber', 'touching', 'memorable', 'origin', 'story', 'Saint', 'Nicholas', 'know', 'Santa', 'be', 'character', 'great', 'generosity', 'love', 'generally', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'possible', 'childhood', 'Christmas', 'Story', 'Joulutarina', 'masterful', 'job', 'spinning', 'tale.Hundreds', 'years', 'ago', 'Nicholas', 'orphaned', 'cared', 'many', 'northern', 'village', 'homes', 'once', 'year', 'Christmas', 'Day', 'Eventually', 'sending', 'homemade', 'toys', 'children', 'families', 'who', 'have', 'cared', 'years', 'age', '13', 'taken', 'grumpy', 'outsider', 'named', 'Isaac', 'who', 'have', 'love', 'compassion', 'heart', 'children.Under', 'Isaac', 'care', 'Nicholas', 'quite', 'carpenter', 'eventually', 'become', 'as', 'close', 'kin', 'crafting', 'gifts', 'children', 'village', 'doing', 'anonymously', 'Then', 'year', 'when', 'sharing', 'toys', 'children', 'village', 'desire', 'bless', 'children', 'not', 'only', 'village', 'far', 'are', 'other', 'touching', 'plot', 'details', 'give', 'story', 'depth', 'meaning', 'never', 'seen', 'Santa', 'mythology', ""'ve"", 'omitted', 'details', 'so', 'may', 'enjoy', 'did.In', 'addition', 'excellent', 'writing', 'film', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'excellent', 'soundtrack', 'filmed', 'Scandinavian', 'language', 'voices', 'have', 'been', 'dubbed', 'English', 'English-language', 'voice', 'actors', 'are', 'John', 'Turturro', 'Transformers', 'Michael', 'Badalucco', 'Practice', 'Noah', 'Emmerich', 'Cellular', ""'re"", 'also', 'enjoy', 'captions', 'are', 'none', 'available', 'DVD', 'However', 'was', 'able', 'engage', 'Closed', 'Captioning', 'feature', 'TV.Parents', 'film', 'been', 'approved', 'Coalition', 'Quality', 'Children', 'Media', 'Dove', 'Foundation', 'quality', 'family', 'entertainment', 'content', 'not', 'include', 'sex', 'nudity', 'gore', 'profanity', 'not', 'really', 'violence', 'Isaac', 'character', 'shove', 'young', 'Nicholas', 'head', 'dusty', 'table', 'one', 'scene', 'also', 'Brat', 'beginning', 'relationship', 'initial', 'scenes', 'Isaac', 'might', 'be', 'bit', 'disturbing', 'very', 'young', 'children', 'bit', 'harsh', 'Nicholas', 'element', 'dishonesty', 'when', 'Santa', 'identity', 'also', 'minor', 'issue', 'Pairing', 'few', 'other', 'intense', 'not', 'terrible', 'thematic', 'elements', 'very', 'few', 'incidents', 'smoking', 'movie', 'earned', 'PG', 'rating.The', 'running', 'time', 'film', '70', 'minutes', '20', 'minute', 'featurette', 'Special', 'Feature', 'section', 'piece', 'not', 'overdubbed', ""'ll"", 'need', 'read', 'subtitles.While', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'moments', 'levity', 'film', 'would', 'not', 'characterize', 'depressing', 'rich', 'tale', 'one', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'told', 'years', 'ago', 'power', 'love', 'compassion', 'sharing', 'evident', 'transforming', 'lives', 'Nicholas', 'life', 'Hopefully', 'many', 'will', 'emulate', 'Nicholas', 'loving', 'unlovable', 'even', 'sharing', 'blessings', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'blessing', 'Truly', 'message', 'unconditional', 'grace-filled', 'love', 'very', 'core', 'true', 'meaning', 'Christmas']",N/A

This inspires Nicholas to make little wooden toys for all of the children familes whom he stayed with.  This is the central idea for the story and origins or Santa Claus, it is basically how Santa Claus could have happened if he were Finnish.Knowing the truth origins of the grand myth of Santa Cluas (Saint Nicholas) this was more of a fun diversion for me than anything and could serve as a possible way to start a conversation nwith your children about the true origins of Santa Claus.I would highly recommend this film to family of children who are around 6 or older because it does deal with themes of death as well as some mild cruelty to the main character, but overall is a very good family film.The one and only downside to this movie is not a fault of the movie itself, but rather the fault of the company that released it here.  For family viewing dubbing is the best choice obviously, and this is fine, but if the quality of the dubbing is equivalent to the infamously poorly dubbed Asian movies and a youtube video made with a camera with a terrible delay, subtitles would be a godsend for those who are not little children.  The dubbing was so painful to watch I couldn't look at the screen most of the time when the characters were talking, sure after a bit you get used to it, but it just shouldn't be this way.Other than the quibble about the atrocious dubbing, this is a very good movie for what it is and is very cute and fun.

1265207,A35Q0RBM3YNQNF,B002ECJZ76,M. Hill,"[1, 1]","Christmas Story shares how St. Nick grew from a child into a legendary character. This is a foreign film, produced in Finland, and dubbed in English. Other reviews have noted the poor dubbing, which is initially a bit distracting because the mouth movement and the spoken words are not even close to a match but eventually the viewer focuses on the story. It is the biggest criticism of a film that there is really nothing else to complain about. The producers may have preferred subtitles but with part of the audience consisting of children too young to read dubbing was the only option.The film is a creative, believable story, set hundreds of years ago in Lapland, a setting that is both beautiful in its stark whiteness, and brutal with its unforgiving cold and piercing wind. This is a completely different environment from the colorful North Pole toy land that usually surrounds the Santa Claus US audiences are accustomed to seeing.I found no inconsistencies with the story, which was laid out in a very logical methodical manner. The ending which necessitated taking a saintly ""human"" figure, Nikolas, and somehow creating the mythical, magical St. Nikolas - transitioning from mortal to immortal made perfect sense to me. I do not want to give away any of the story but note that for young children, early on there is a devastating accident resulting in deaths which are constantly referenced throughout the movie. The film shares many valuable lessons, something the writers clearly made a priority. There is even a slightly villainous character that takes young Nick in and although the audience worries for his safety, finds the pivotal point in the film resting in the relationship between these two lonely people.This movie has such a different feel to it, and tells such a captivating story that I will make a point of watching it each Christmas season.  This would make a great gift for a fan of Christmas movies because it isn't a Hollywood blockbuster, so the recipient probably doesn't already own it, or even know about it.

1265208,A207275AVUSNE3,B002ECJZ76,"M. M. ""inquisitive designer""","[4, 4]","This is a superbly rich and beautiful children's movie that tells the story of how Santa Claus came to be.  Adults may not want to buy or rent this film just to watch by themselves, but it is perfect for a family movie night.Spoiler-free plot summary: A young boy named Nikolas grows up in a small, wintry Finnish village and experiences a tumultuous early childhood.  Mentored by a grumpy-turned-benevolent woodworker named Isaac, Nikolas becomes ""Father Christmas"" and brings joy to the village children with his beautiful hand-carved toys.  (If you want a very in-depth plot summary, including spoilers, please scroll down to the paragraph with the two asterisks ** in front.)The cinematography is superb, artistic, and lasting -- so different from the choppy shots in mainstream American movies.  The location is breathtaking, and the movie is worth watching for the landscape/snowscape shots alone.  Personally, I found the characters -- with the exception of ""crazy"" Isaac (as the village children call him) -- to be fairly one-dimensional and the dialogue to be somewhat stilted and unrealistic; but this could be due in part to the translation from Finnish to American English.  Nevertheless, these elements do not detract from the movie's overall beauty or message of love, generosity, family, and happiness.Although obviously written and produced in Finnish, the film has been dubbed in American English for release in the US.  This is perfect for younger viewers who may not be able to follow along with subtitles.  However, there are conspicuous lip-synch issues with the English dubbing.  I would have preferred to watch the film in spoken Finnish with English subtitles; but unfortunately this option is not available on the DVD, which is a huge disservice to adult viewers and older children.The film is rated PG, likely because the subject matter is somewhat heavier than the standard American kids' movie.  There is sadness and tragedy (death) at the beginning of the film, as well as one very dark, aggressive, mean-spirited antagonist -- ""crazy"" Isaac -- who could be frightening to very young and/or sensitive viewers.  However, the rest of the movie is more lighthearted and is very positive and uplifting.All in all, this is a top quality holiday film appropriate for all ages.  Had the DVD included spoken Finnish with English subtitles, I would give it 5 stars.** Complete plot summary, INCLUDING SPOILERS, for parents/caretakers who want to ensure that there's nothing inappropriate or too scary for their youngsters (do NOT read below if you don't want spoilers!):The film begins at night, in a one-room log cabin, in the midst of a terrible snowstorm.  Six-year-old Nikolas stays at home while his parents venture outside to take his baby sister to the doctor.  Nikolas's family dies in the storm, and two village wardens come to collect the boy.  It is understood (although not directly stated) that Nikolas's family died because they fell through a thin patch of ice over the river.At a town hall meeting, the village decides to move orphan Nikolas from family to family each year on Christmas because no one can afford to feed or clothe him longer than that.  At the meeting, the audience is introduced to ""crazy"" Isaac, a gruff, dark, witch-looking man with an angry and booming voice, who lives on the village outskirts.  Isaac bitterly suggests that Nikolas be thrown into the river with his parents.  The villagers obviously choose to help Nikolas, so the boy moves in with his first family.  Nikolas is grateful for the hospitality and begins to carve little wooden Christmas toys for the children of the families he stays with.Six years later, the village holds another town hall meeting.  The fish harvest has been especially poor and no families can afford to keep Nikolas this year.  The villagers are at a loss as to what to do, when Isaac -- who is still angry, bitter, and scary at this point -- offers to have Nikolas live with him.  Wary at first, and literally left with no other option, the villagers eventually agree; and Nikolas and his meager belongings are sent to live with Isaac on the village outskirts.  Isaac has a simple cabin perched on a hill overlooking a beautiful fjord; in the basement is a huge wood workshop.  For the first year, Isaac calls Nikolas ""brat"" and demands to be called ""master"" as he shows the boy how to use the woodworking equipment and choose the best trees for lumber.  Isaac is a successful woodcarver and sells his wares at the bustling city market, Nikolas in tow.If your children watch the movie all the way through, they will not be scared of Isaac by the end of it.  Isaac slowly but surely warms up when he discovers Nikolas's secret toymaking; Isaac even helps Nikolas deliver the toys the next Christmas.  Nikolas learns that Isaac acts so angry and grumpy because his wife died and his children left him.  The bond between Nikolas and Isaac grows as the seasons change, and before you know it Nikolas is an adult (and is starting to look more and more like Santa Claus, with long white blond hair and a scruffy beard!).Grumpy Isaac is now an old man, and his sons, remorseful for leaving their father so many years earlier, come to collect him so he can live with them in a distant town.  The bond between Isaac and Nikolas is strong, and Isaac's departure is sad for both of them.  Isaac gives Nikolas a key to a large trunk inside the cabin, which contains all the money Isaac ever made from his woodworking business.Nikolas now makes toys for all the village children and enlists his friend Emile to help keep track of all the children's names and houses.  Nikolas uses Isaac's sled to deliver the toys, and his bag has become so heavy that he must purchase four reindeer to help pull the sleigh to the village.  And, wouldn't you know it, the reindeer only respond to Nikolas's command when he wears red, so he purchases a luxurious burgundy cap and overcoat: unmistakably Santa Claus!In the meantime, Nikolas has befriended Emile's daughter, Aada (pronounced ""odda"").  Aada often hangs out in the wood workshop and helps Nikolas deliver the Christmas toys to the village children.  Nikolas carves a beautiful box with an enclosed note for Aada and delivers the toys by himself one Christmas, and then he disappears.  Aada and her family know that they will never see Nikolas again (has he died? no explanation is given).  The village parents decide to honor and continue Nikolas's tradtion by giving their children gifts each Christmas.  Note that this last part -- that parents now give their children gifts -- is very, very subtly conveyed through minimalist dialogue; adults and teens will notice it, but children may not.Overall, this is a highly artistic film with a beautiful message of love, generosity, family, and hope.

1265209,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,B002ECJZ76,Monty Moonlight,"[1, 2]","If you enjoy movies about the life of Santa Claus and his origins, here is a very different one from Finland that takes a much more realistic approach and is well worth checking out. It's the story of a boy named Nikolas, hundreds of years ago, who loses his parents and baby sister at Christmas. The only orphan in Nikolas's tiny fishing village, it is decided he will be taken care of by a different family each year. This holds for a while, until the families can no longer afford to care for him. Then, the mean and bitter carpenter Iisakki takes him in when he notices Nikolas's talent for carving in the toys he gives to the village children. Soon, Nikolas is an adult with a passion for making and giving toys on Christmas Eve, but he is determined that his tradition shall carry on after he is gone.Without spoiling too much, that is the main plot of ""Christmas Story"". So, you may have noticed that this isn't the Bob Clark/Jean Shepherd classic about Ralph Parker's quest for an official Red Ryder B.B. gun. It also isn't a Disney film, yet the folks at Anchor Bay have cleverly seen fit to include a magazine quote above the title stating that, ""If WALT DISNEY would have known how, this is the kind of CHRISTMAS STORY he would have created."" Well, I'm not sure why they think Walt Disney wouldn't have known how, and I'm sure this is NOT the kind of Christmas Story he would have done. This film is light on fantasy. In fact, it seems to be trying to tell a completely reality-based tale. Not a true story, mind you; this isn't the story of the real-life Saint Nicholas. But ""Christmas Story"" is instead a fictional story, a fully believable one, about a man named Nikolas who inspired the Santa legend. It actually reinforces the concept of parents giving the gifts and saying they are from ""Father Christmas"" rather than the idea that Santa is this immortal, magical person who lives at the North Pole. So, this may be a deciding factor for some of you. I tend to prefer the more fanciful Santa Claus stories myself, personal faves being ""Here Comes Santa Claus"" and ""Santa Claus: The Movie"", but this is still a good film for the most part. I can't see it being all that entertaining for children, however. I'd say this film would be better enjoyed by adults. One thing throws me off a bit though, and that's the ending. I don't think it's too revealing to say that we do see Santa flying through the sky, as do characters in the film, and this seems to contradict the film's telling of Nikolas only inspiring a legend... However, I've come to terms with the idea that the ending is just symbolic rather than a huge jump in the story bringing up a ton of questions. Because, seriously, the first time I watched the film, I was left wondering, ""Wait a minute! They didn't explain how he became immortal and learned to fly, and so on and so on!"" No, they didn't. This was just a movie about a real guy, which I realized on the second viewing, and that's not exactly what I want in a Santa Claus film, but it was still a mostly pleasing movie.It should be pointed out that ""Christmas Story"" is a rather short film. It clocks in at around an hour and 17 minutes, which was after about 7 minutes of end credits. It's a good thing this film is usually found for around and under 10 dollars. Some may applaud the pacing and editing that make the film so brisk, but frankly, I think there was room for more character motivation and relationship development here and there. The film's better half is unquestionably the first half: Nikolas as a child. Plus, in that first half you still have hope that you  are watching a more traditional Santa film that will explain the flight, the elves, and all that good stuff. In the second half, Nikolas is an adult, most of the joy in his hard and lonely life comes from his focus on Christmas and making/giving gifts. When he first is shown as passionate about expanding his operations, he actually seems to have been driven a bit mad by his loneliness, which is fascinating but not too charming, but other parts of the adult years half are still very enjoyable, like the introduction of reindeer and his red suit. This second half of the film does have those special moments, and it's still very touching at times, if lacking a rich conflict/climax beyond the question of Nikolas's mortality vs. his legend.So, when all is said and done, this is a charming enough fictional story about a man who inspired the legend of Santa Claus. I personally can't help but wonder, why make a totally realistic Santa film that is fictional? Why not base it on Saint Nicholas's own story then? Oh well, whatever the reason, yes, this is a nice little Christmas movie, probably better appreciated by older viewers. It's brief, it's dubbed in English from the original Finnish (no option to view with the original audio), it has beautiful anamorphic widescreen visuals, fine acting (though the voiceover work varies), and the DVD includes a nice, meaty behind-the-scenes featurette and the film's trailer. While it could have been better, it's quite pleasant if you're interested in a less fantastic take on the origins of Santa Claus.",4,Santa as a mortal man who inspired a legend,1259539200,"11 30,

1265210,AXLN36UV9KGXD,B002ECJZ76,Mr John Haueisen,"[0, 0]","The cover claimed this would be the kind of Christmas movie that Walt Disney would have produced, so of course I had my doubts.  But I'm happy to say that such glowing praise was entirely deserved.What you see here is a telling of the story of Santa Claus, from his childhood as an orphan, trying to find his place in the world, to the Santa we all watch for each Christmas season.It is very well-acted, with dubbing in English done so well that I barely noticed it had been dubbed from the original Finnish.

The story of old Saint Nick told from Finland perspective is a marvelous story that is sweet, but never sappy and really belies the whole Holiday film clich&eacute;. The story of Santa Claus is told so matter of fact, that I felt like I was watching a ""regular"" movie! The only thing that keeps me from giving this a full 5 stars is the dubbing is a little off(unfortunately the original language option is not included) and that I think the film would have been better if it ended about a minute sooner. The shot of the spirit Santa Claus driving off in his sleigh, just took away all the realism that this film was giving me in so much abundance. I know, I know...it's a ""holiday movie"", but this film is so much more than that and I think it would have spoken louder and more profound had it showed us a little less. This is a small grievance and this film will be in my yearly holiday watching repertoire from now on!

Rated PG, this movie is good for kids of all ages.Young Nicholas is orphaned at a young age and nobody in the small fishing village can afford to raise him, so he is sent to live with 6 families, one year at a time, with the change on Christmas Day.  While this is sad, he is cared for and cherished in each home, and builds life long bonds with the children.  To show his gratitude, Nicholas begins carving wooden toys for each of the village children and leaving them anonymously on doorsteps each Christmas.After 6 years,  Nicholas is taken in by Isaac, an eccentric hermit who comes into town to sell his wares to the locals, and yells at the children when he does.  Turns out Isaac is a master carpenter and takes Nicholas on as his apprentice, teaching him everything he knows about wood-carving.Soon enough, the two have expanded their territories and are delivering hand-made toys to children in several villages each Christmas.  Meanwhile, Nicholas never forgets his toddler sister who died so many years before, when his parents and she were killed by falling into a frozen lake.  This element is touched upon often throughout the story.The tale follows Nicholas the toymaker while new people are added and he gets older in years.  Always generous and selfless, Nicholas only gives his toys anonymously.The story is touching and heartfelt.  There are important messages that should be reminded this time of year also.

The villagers, not knowing what else to do, decide that a different family will provide Nikolas his home for a year, and each Christmas, Nikolas will move to the next family. During this process, Nikolas begins carving wooden animals and other toys to repay his friends' kindness, and he leaves these gifts outside the recipients' doors on Christmas.At one point, a local carpenter, Iisakki (the wonderful Finnish actor Kari V&auml;&auml;n&auml;nen), discovers Nikolas's ability with carving and convinces the village that he should take Nikolas in. Gruff and bitter at first, Iisakki insists that Nikolas refer to him as ""Master"" and treats the boy as a servant. Eventually, though, Iisakki warms to the boy, and they develop a caring relationship as Nikolas continues his gift-giving.The film is wonderful to look at, shot as it was in Finnish Lapland, and there is little to prevent fairly young children from enjoying the film. The film is rated PG because of ""mild thematic elements and brief smoking,"" according to the MPAA. The thematic elements, I presume, are primarily the elements that make Nikolas an orphan (the deaths of his parents and young brother). The smoking refers to pipes that several of the characters have.DVD extras include a ""making of"" featurette (in Finnish with English subtitles) and the film's trailer (in English).

After all, what better time of year to see the origins of Saint Nick?If you have a high def or large screen TV, this video can be distracting as the voices are dubbed in and as such, the facial movements do not match up with the voices.  While not a big issue, it is distracting and becomes more so the larger your TV is.This is a very sad story that does not particularly inspire.  The movie attempts to explain the childhood of the person who would become Saint Nick and casts him as an orphan after his father, mother, and sister perish on thin ice while attempting to go to a doctor in a snow storm.  Nicholas is then cast about from one family to another in a poor fishing town because no one can afford to adopt him and provide enough food to support him and their families.  He eventually winds up with an outsider who initially is cruel to him, but then warms up to him.After 72 minutes of running time, Nicholas (an old man now) disappears on a Christmas Day after delivering presents for his last time due to his age.  He then magically reappears on the next Christmas (with no explanation of how or why this happens) driving a sleigh up in the sky and wishing everyone a merry Christmas.This is not a film that leaves you feeling good; rather, it leaves you a bit confused and depressed at the end.

Produced in Finland, the story begins with parents leaving their young son in a small house on the edge of a lake while they take his infant sister to the village to see a doctor. Tragedy strikes and the boy becomes an orphan. That boy becomes Santa Claus.I won't mention anymore of the story because I don't want to spoil it for anyone but what is unique about the story is that rather than relying on elves and magic flying reindeer and a mysterious workshop in the North Pole the story presents a very human Santa interested in honoring his lost parents and sister and those who have been kind to him when he was in need. The magic of Santa is as much in who Santa is rather than his delivering of toys on Christmas Eve which he also does.The movie was shot in Finland with a Finnish cast. The filming was done at times in frigid conditions. Some filming was done in Lapland. The fact that the film was shot in conditions that we associate with Santa Claus adds to the film.  The scenery is amazing as well.The movie has ""Family Approved"" and ""Kids First"" symbols on the box and I agree it is a good movie for children.  My only two concerns would be that this Santa is different from the Santa Claus we learn about in the United States with eight reindeer led by Rudolf and elves helping Santa with the presents. So if you have young children brought up with that interpretation of Santa Claus there may be questions. Also, as mentioned, death occurs in this movie. Some young children may be uncomfortable with the idea of Santa's parents and sister dying.My only complaint is that while the film is in English the actors spoke Finnish and their lines were later dubbed in English.  As a result on a few occasions the actors mouths stopped moving while they were still speaking. The dubbing is done well but it must be hard to dub when you are changing languages. There is no option to watch the film in its original Finnish with English subtitles.  There is a ""The Making of Christmas Story"" feature with the actors speaking Finnish and with English subtitles.

It has become a movie that will be seen every year in our home.This movie is dubbed in English, as it is a Finnish movie, but this makes no difference as the beautiful scenery and pure spirit of the film rise above everything that we have come to know as Santa Claus or St. Nick.The Finnish Director and Producer Juha Wuolijoki one day said to himself, Have you ever wondered how Santa Claus became Santa Claus? To answer this question, he made the most beautiful movie ever told about Saint Nick- called Christmas Story. The story begins with a little 7 year old boy named Nikolas and shows how his life molded him into the man he became, which had such a great impact on everyone, that hundreds of years later we still carry on the tradition of gift giving at Christmas.The film was shot in Northern Finland and in an old village in Finnish Lapland. To say these actors were truly freezing to death at below zero temperatures in the frigid arctic would be an understatement! There is nothing quite as beautiful as the real arctic, and not using fake snow in a film studio, to film a movie about Saint Nick! The real village, the real reindeer, the spectacularly gorgeous white scenery all give the movie a genuine magical quality that is illuminated by the beautiful old lanterns in the fishing village and on the sleighs! We all gasped when we first saw the candle lit workshop that would become Santa's toyshop, and this was filmed in an old mine- not a film set! It's a visual, magical feast for the eyes!The very believable actors in their beautifully made period costumes, are mostly Finnish and some Swedish and the characters they play each have a tremendous impact on how Nikolas becomes Santa Claus.The gifts Nikolas leaves for all the people in his village are not just given in gratitude, but it is obvious he wanted to leave them a little part of himself. The movie also contains bonus material on The Making Of Christmas Story, which is just as lovely as the movie. Now, thanks to Juha Wuolijoki, everytime I give or receive a Christmas gift, I will not only know it is given or received in happiness and gratitude, but that it contains a little part of ourselves and of Saint Nick- and that is the truest and purest meaning of the Spirit of Santa Claus! This is one Christmas Story that will become a permanent part of our yearly traditions for the lovely Holidays!",5,Another Wonderful Must-Have Christmas Movie!,1259452800,"11 29, 2009",2009,2519,"['lover', 'Christmas', 'movies', 'was', 'totally', 'unprepared', 'impact', 'Christmas', 'Story', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'entire', 'family', 'become', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'seen', 'year', 'home.This', 'movie', 'dubbed', 'English', 'Finnish', 'movie', 'difference', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'pure', 'spirit', 'film', 'rise', 'everything', 'have', 'come', 'know', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'St.', 'Nick.The', 'Finnish', 'Director', 'Producer', 'Juha', 'Wuolijoki', 'one', 'day', 'said', 'Have', 'ever', 'wondered', 'how', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'became', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'answer', 'question', 'made', 'most', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'ever', 'told', 'Saint', 'Nick-', 'called', 'Christmas', 'Story', 'story', 'little', '7', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'named', 'Nikolas', 'how', 'life', 'molded', 'man', 'became', 'had', 'great', 'impact', 'everyone', 'hundreds', 'years', 'later', 'still', 'carry', 'tradition', 'gift', 'giving', 'Christmas.The', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'Northern', 'Finland', 'old', 'village', 'Finnish', 'Lapland', 'say', 'actors', 'were', 'truly', 'freezing', 'death', 'zero', 'temperatures', 'frigid', 'arctic', 'would', 'be', 'understatement', 'nothing', 'quite', 'as', 'beautiful', 'real', 'arctic', 'not', 'using', 'fake', 'snow', 'film', 'studio', 'film', 'movie', 'Saint', 'Nick', 'real', 'village', 'real', 'reindeer', 'spectacularly', 'gorgeous', 'white', 'scenery', 'give', 'movie', 'genuine', 'magical', 'quality', 'illuminated', 'beautiful', 'old', 'lanterns', 'fishing', 'village', 'sleighs', 'gasped', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'candle', 'lit', 'workshop', 'would', 'become', 'Santa', 'toyshop', 'was', 'filmed', 'old', 'mine-', 'not', 'film', 'set', 'visual', 'magical', 'feast', 'eyes', 'very', 'believable', 'actors', 'beautifully', 'made', 'period', 'costumes', 'are', 'mostly', 'Finnish', 'Swedish', 'characters', 'play', 'have', 'tremendous', 'impact', 'how', 'Nikolas', 'Santa', 'Claus.The', 'gifts', 'Nikolas', 'people', 'village', 'are', 'not', 'just', 'given', 'gratitude', 'obvious', 'wanted', 'leave', 'little', 'part', 'movie', 'also', 'bonus', 'material', 'Making', 'Christmas', 'Story', 'just', 'as', 'lovely', 'movie', 'Now', 'thanks', 'Juha', 'Wuolijoki', 'everytime', 'give', 'receive', 'Christmas', 'gift', 'will', 'not', 'only', 'know', 'given', 'received', 'happiness', 'gratitude', 'little', 'part', 'ourselves', 'Saint', 'Nick-', 'truest', 'purest', 'meaning', 'Spirit', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'one', 'Christmas', 'Story', 'will', 'become', 'permanent', 'part', 'yearly', 'traditions', 'lovely']",N/A
1265225,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B002ECJZ76,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[2, 2]","First of all, this is not Bob Clark's wonderful holiday favorite, ""A Christmas Story.""  This is a Finnish film dubbed in English.  A young boy, Nikolas, loses his family and is left alone and homeless.  The village folk decide that he will spend one year in each of the town's families.  To acknowledge the kindness of the families, Nikolas makes toys year-round and delivers the gifts by leaving them outside the villagers' homes.  Once the viewer gets used to the not-so-great dubbing and settles into the story, it holds the attention and has charm.  The movie is really a fable, played out initially as a traditional drama.  The Finnish Lapland locations are beautifully filmed, and the production design evokes a long-ago era.  The movie is not a familiar, recycled Christmas saga, but one that is both entertaining, somewhat sad, and ultimately teaches a lesson about giving, responsibility, and gratitude.  The central character is a sort of role model.  For one of such a tender age, Nikolas is gracious, polite, hard-working, and recognizes and appreciates the generosity of others.  The film underscores the theme of repaying generosity and kindness with the same, but does so in a non-preachy manner.  There's a making-of featurette included as well as a theatrical trailer.  I just wish the film had been released in the original Finnish with English subtitles.",4,A Touching Holiday Tale,1259539200,"11 30, 2009",2009,1373,"['First', 'all', 'not', 'Bob', 'Clark', 'wonderful', 'holiday', 'favorite', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Story', 'Finnish', 'film', 'dubbed', 'English', 'A', 'young', 'boy', 'Nikolas', 'family', 'left', 'alone', 'homeless', 'village', 'folk', 'decide', 'will', 'spend', 'one', 'year', 'town', 'families', 'acknowledge', 'kindness', 'families', 'Nikolas', 'toys', 'year-round', 'gifts', 'leaving', 'villagers', 'homes', 'viewer', 'used', 'not-so-great', 'dubbing', 'story', 'attention', 'charm', 'movie', 'really', 'fable', 'played', 'out', 'initially', 'traditional', 'drama', 'Finnish', 'Lapland', 'locations', 'are', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'production', 'design', 'long-ago', 'era', 'movie', 'not', 'familiar', 'recycled', 'Christmas', 'saga', 'one', 'entertaining', 'somewhat', 'sad', 'ultimately', 'lesson', 'giving', 'responsibility', 'gratitude', 'central', 'character', 'sort', 'role', 'model', 'one', 'tender', 'age', 'Nikolas', 'gracious', 'polite', 'hard-working', 'recognizes', 'generosity', 'others', 'film', 'theme', 'repaying', 'generosity', 'kindness', 'same', 'so', 'non-preachy', 'manner', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'included', 'as', 'well', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'just', 'wish', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'released', 'original', 'Finnish', 'English', 'subtitles']",N/A

Without the credits, the movie only runs an hour and ten minutes. I kept wishing the makers of the film would elaborate and explain more on some of the scenes that seemed cut short or rushed. I've seen some really, really bad movies that run almost two hours, this one could and should have run ten minutes longer than it did. My second complaint is the ending. I can't go into it too much without giving anything away, so I'll just say that I had to guess what might have happened for the ending to take place. The visuals are absolutley gorgeous and should be watched for that alone. It was shot in Finland and dubbed in English. Someone pointed that it was annoying because the voices didn't match the lips. I grew up on dubbed Godzilla movies, so this didn't bother me in the least. This movie doesn't look as badly dubbed as a Godzilla movie except in a few spots, but don't let these minor complaints deter you from watching this beautiful movie.

I don't even think I would have noticed the dubbed voices, if someone else hadn't pointed it out to me. Our family loves holiday movies, especially this time of year, and we all enjoyedChristmas Story.The story opens with a little boy named Nicholas, orphaned after his family fell through some ice at night. The brief scene opened a flood of questions from my 4yr old, but it was easy to handle since we've already discussed death and the afterlife with our son. (Not sure if that counts as a spoiler, but I thought some parents might want to be prepared for any questions.) The other villagers decide to take turns looking after him; he spends one year with each family, and then moves to a new household on Christmas day. During this time, Nicholas starts to make toys for the children, as a way to say ""thank-you"" for caring for him.However, after six years, there is a food shortage in the village. The families can no longer take care of Nicholas, but a carpenter offers to take him instead. The carpenter, Isaac, is a mean-tempered man that wants to put Nicholas to work in his woodshop. He even renames Nicholas, ""I will call you Brat!"" Despite his nasty personality, Isaac is able to teach Nicholas the wood-working trade.When the year is up, Isaac learns about the toys that Nicholas makes for the village children. Isaac tells him that he too lost his family, and explains why he is so mean to children. That disclosure changes the relationship between the carpenter and the boy.As Nicholas grows up, he begins to resemble the Santa image we are familiar with. We see him put together his team of reindeer, and we learn why he wears a red suit. (The entire scene with the reindeer had my son laughing his head off.) Unfortunately, there is more sadness in the adult life of Nicholas, which only strengthens his resolve to uphold his tradition of handing out presents. I liked the supporting chracters, and the different dimension they gave to the Santa story. The ending was quite a surprise.This is a great family movie with a beautiful story that will entertain all ages. The sentiment is comparable toThe Polar ExpressandSanta Claus Is Comin to Town, but in live action.
