1431734,A27BN7M1N93SIE,B004XC5LHS,bozeman1941,"[2, 3]","The first thing you notice about this series is the stunning picture and sound quality (even for blu-ray!). The animation is utterly superb; the opening sequence (of Kanade playing the piano) completely takes your breath away, and the end theme is also very poignant and beautifully done. The story is based on the unusual premise of a sort of 'afterlife' if you will (although not really in the Judeo-Christian sense; this one appears to be in a Japanese high school!) where the characters go after death, if they died feeling unfulfilled or badly-done-to. A side effect of being in this 'pergatory' is that the inhabitants cannot die; they can be 'killed' say by a gunshot or knife, but reawaken shortly after, fully restored. However; dying still hurts just as much as in the 'real' world, so they try not to be 'killed' too often! The characters can decide to 'pass over' to eternity, once they are convinced there is no further reason for them to stay. When that happens, the character simply disappears; usually the camera view will switch away from the character who is 'passing', and when it comes back, they are gone. No sound or visual clue accompanies their passing. The story follows the efforts of a group of the 'students', who have formed a band of rebel freedom fighters, to avoid 'passing on', as they feel aggrieved, and that it is God's fault that they died prematurely! I won't give any more detail, as it would spoil the story, but have your Kleenex ready; you will cry at various points in the story, especially at the end. But anime fans (and anybody else really), should see this series; it is beautiful, and VERY emotional; I cannot find a bad thing to say about it. Even the music score is awesome; I got the soundtrack album after watching the series - the full versions of the opening and closing themes (the latter being nearly 9 minutes long!) will also make you cry, especially if you read the translation of the lyrics; it is hauntingly beautiful. The English dub is excellent, with many of the well-known US voice actors appearing (Blake Shepherd as Otanashi, the male lead, Britney Karbowski as Yuri, Emily Neves as Kanade (also known as 'Angel'), Greg Ayres as Ayato Naio, and David Matranga (from 'Clannad') as Hideki), so many will be familiar with their voices.I am only sorry that there doesn't appear to be a sequel in the offing; the ending of the series was kind of final, so it would be difficult to explain a sequel.

1431740,A3PEN0MCANLUOK,B004XC5LHS,Coulter Rail,"[2, 4]","Angel Beats!  is an immensely successful comedy and a virtual Hindenburg of a drama.  The main character wakes up in a high school purgatory where cute gun wielding girls and dips*** bros are struggling against the adorable and emotionally vacant Angel, who seems to have a mission to stop their rebellious ways and J Pop jam sessions.  Don't get me wrong.  That's the good stuff.Let's linger on the good for moment because there is a lot of it.  The animation is fluid and bright but stylized in a way that makes it a unique success.  The action is violent and hilarious.  The characters are a laugh riot when humor is the goal of the scene.  The story is open ended with enough intrigue to keep you guessing.The regrettable low points of this show are the forced teen melodrama and played out revelations that despite their heavy tone carry all the depth of the ""Wizard of Oz"" meeting ""What Dreams May Come.""  Whole episodes are stolen to explore the &#8220;character of the weeks'&#8221; past life pity party.  I don't want to crap too hard on their drama.  Some of the back stories are enlightening, and serve to thicken the characters, but most of them are kiddy pool shallow and don't match up to the sharp comedy and lightning fast wit of the action narrative.It feels like the writers orchestrated a quick purgatory platform to sell their outrageous comedy and to poke fun a stereotypes, but when faced with the meaning of their world, fell into one of those stereotypes and churned out some painfully redundant teen drama and tied it up with a dues ex machina that might seem original to new anime fans, but is actually a very popular way to end a series.All in all, this is a good show.  The comedy is spot on and smells like Excel Saga.  The animation takes blinding color to a new level and wields it well.  The action is gorgeous.  All of these wonderful things just end up taking a back seat to its weakest link (crepe thin introvert soul diving).  I would tell friends not to judge this anime by its cover, but after viewing I would say to go ahead.  The cover is pretty accurate.  High school girls, fun, guns and drama.  It just wish the drama would have taken a back seat and left the bland help-me-cuts to another show.Watch Angel Beats!

1431742,A1GW690RCZE0WL,B004XC5LHS,Draconis March,"[5, 5]","I can't help but feel my review should be longer for such a masterpiece, but I think I can state everything that needs to be said pretty succinctly.... Okay, fine.  I can't.  There's a tl;dr version at the end for you lazy butts.This series is, by far, the greatest thing I've ever seen.  (By ""thing,"" I mean among all of the anime, movies, web series, TV series... whatever.)  By far, the two strongest points of the series are the emotional involvement and the music.  The series does an AMAZING job at making you feel for the characters.  All of their stories touched my heart in ways I can't begin to describe.  Although admittedly, some of the characters aren't given much depth.  But, I'd say, with how short the series is, they did awesome with just the ones that ARE explored.As for the music, this series has the most beautiful, powerful, and moving music I've ever heard.  The intro and outro themes are easily the best out of any anime I've ever seen.  And, especially once you start learning the characters' stories and feeling for them emotionally, they gain a level of unprecedented beauty and emotional appeal/connection that you have to experience yourself to believe.  It's extremely hard to get hold of the tracks (legally) in the US, but if you can, by all means: GET THEM.  Actually BUY the songs and support these talented musicians.  The songs gain even more meaning when you hear their full versions and read the translated lyrics.  The women that sing the songs have the most beautiful voices I've ever heard.  No contest.  BUT, I do wish they hadn't abused the soft, sad ending song during scenes that were meant to be funny.  It just seemed disrespectful for such a beautiful song and wasn't necessary at all.Another particularly strong attribute of the series is the beautiful animation.  The visuals are absolutely GORGEOUS.  It's for this reason that, if you're debating whether you should get the Blu-ray or the DVD, WHY ARE YOU EVEN WONDERING?  Get the BD.  The visual quality it affords makes the act of watching/downloading it illegally even more of a crime than it already is.  [At the time of writing this review, the price for the Blu-ray is $59.99.  I don't understand why it's so expensive now; I got it on sale for $38.99.  Such a ridiculous price increase is... well, ridiculous.  Hopefully the price will deflate once it's been out for a little while.]The English dub is phenomenal as well.  I tend to watch anime in English so I can keep track of the visuals and not have to try reading subtitles at the same time.  Luckily, if you're like me, it's good news for you.  Every single English VA delivers their lines with the perfect tone and emotional compulsion you'd expect.  I can't remember a single line that sounded like it should've been delivered better.  AND, every VA matched and portrayed their respective character BEAUTIFULLY.  They also don't muddle with the soundtrack at all.  (Some people expressed fear of them trying to redo the songs in English, which is a completely retarded idea.  They left them untouched.)  However, there are a few minor errors in the English dub.  In episode 4, Otonashi says ""It looks like she has good reflexes than me.""  I'm just like, ""WTF?  How'd this make it to the final product?""  I'm not even gonna try to give possible excuses.  Also, in episode 10, they clearly pronounce ""suplex"" wrong.  But that's it.I like how Angel Beats! is sexy without dishing out fan service outright.  If you don't know what fan service is, it's basically when characters (almost always female) are shown in skimpy (or no) clothing to appeal to the (almost always male) members of the audience.  For it to be considered fan service, the exposure of the character is gratuitous (aka: not necessary whatsoever).  (I'm looking at you, Evangelion; although there are many offenders in the world of anime.)  There are extremely attractive female characters that don't need to expose themselves to be beautiful, appealing, and/or sexy.However, despite all of it's amazingness, Angel Beats! isn't without a couple flaws.The first is that it should've been longer.  Although I hate series that are too long, and they did great with how long they decided to make it, it's obvious there could've been more to it.  For example, they could've done more send-off episodes for the minor characters (besides the one, which I won't spoil).  Although it would've taken way too long to do an episode per person, they could've squished 2 or 3 easily into one episode.  Also, I feel there could've been more exploration of their world.  I myself am not even sure what I mean by this, but it's true.The second is the ending.  There were some big, fundamental qustions that would've been nice to have answered--mostly regarding the world itself, and Kanade.  It felt rushed.  (See my note at the bottom regarding executive meddling.)*** WARNING:  This paragraph contains SPOILERS.  Skip to the next paragraph if you don't want to read SPOILERS ***  It saved itself from being a total tearjerker (erring WAY to the bitter side of the bittersweet scale) with the little 15-second or so clip at the end; without it, I'd probably cry myself to sleep every night.  When Kanade and Izuru (Otanashi) run into each other in the real world again, it would've been much happier if they had actually shown them looking each other in the eyes and smiling or something.  It would only add maybe 10 seconds and, in my opinion, would leave viewers much more at ease without changing anything.  In my own little perfect fantasy world, it would've been best if it had briefly shown them ALL actually meeting up again in the real world.  But oh well. *** END SPOILERS ***Anyway, there are a few little insignificant flaws more nitpicky people single out, but they don't make any real difference to me in the scheme of things.tl;dr:  Beautiful series that takes out your heart strings and plays a beautiful melody on them.  Favorite anime of all time.Let's recap:+ Deep character exploration+ Beautiful emotional appeal+ Heart-moving music+ Stunning visuals+ Great English dub- Should've been longerPS:  I just wanted to emphasize the emotional power of Angel Beats!  When I first heard there was humor in it, I was a little turned off.  But after watching it, I realized that if they hadn't mixed humor in with the emotional drama, it would probably be a lot harder on your heart strings.Update:  I watched the series 3 times in the first week since having it, and am looking at a 4th viewing.  This is the only series I've had such an urge to rewatch.  The comedy gets funnier every time, and the ending still never fails to bring a tear to my eye.I found out that the reason the series is only 13 episodes is due to executive meddling.

This is one of the most touching shows I have ever seen, not just in anime, but in all forms of media. I fell in love with this show from the first episode and couldn't stop watching it, I was hooked on it so much that I finished it an entire day and I have no regrets.Of course I'm going to be getting this the second it comes out here in the states on DVD. This is a show I could watch over and over and over again, I would never get sick of it.I don't want to spoil the plot but I'll go into little detail just to get your head wrapped around it. When these young students die they are sent into an afterlife that they do not truly understand and they believe if they give up and announce they truly died they will vanish from existence, it's only when the characters ban together and work along side each other do they understand the truth about dying in peace.This show has so much going for it, a tremendous musical score, great comedy for the relief, a wonderful cast of developing characters, and one of the best stories I have ever seen. I don't care how strong you are or if you are too manly to cry, when you see that final episode you will have tears streaming down your cheeks on just how fantastic it is.Angel Beats is not just one of the best Animes I have seen, it's one of the best television shows I have ever watched.Do yourself a favor and don't miss this one.",5,Never has a show brought me this many tears.,1309305600,"06 29, 2011",2011,1517,"['do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'where', 'begin', 'review', 'show', 'so', 'damn', 'good', 'wish', 'had', 'perfect', 'word', 'do', ""n't"", 'one', 'most', 'touching', 'shows', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'not', 'just', 'anime', 'forms', 'media', 'fell', 'love', 'show', 'first', 'episode', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'watching', 'was', 'hooked', 'so', 'much', 'finished', 'entire', 'day', 'have', 'regrets.Of', 'course', ""'m"", 'going', 'be', 'getting', 'second', 'out', 'here', 'states', 'DVD', 'show', 'could', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'would', 'never', 'get', 'sick', 'it.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'plot', ""'ll"", 'go', 'little', 'detail', 'just', 'get', 'head', 'wrapped', 'When', 'young', 'students', 'are', 'sent', 'afterlife', 'do', 'not', 'truly', 'understand', 'believe', 'give', 'up', 'announce', 'truly', 'died', 'will', 'vanish', 'existence', 'only', 'when', 'characters', 'ban', 'together', 'work', 'along', 'side', 'other', 'do', 'understand', 'truth', 'dying', 'peace.This', 'show', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'tremendous', 'musical', 'score', 'great', 'comedy', 'relief', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'developing', 'characters', 'one', 'best', 'stories', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'how', 'strong', 'are', 'are', 'too', 'manly', 'cry', 'when', 'see', 'final', 'episode', 'will', 'have', 'tears', 'streaming', 'down', 'cheeks', 'just', 'how', 'fantastic', 'is.Angel', 'Beats', 'not', 'just', 'one', 'best', 'Animes', 'have', 'seen', 'one', 'best', 'television', 'shows', 'have', 'ever', 'watched.Do', 'favor', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'one']",Angel Beats!

1431745,A3TRWCKDLYECZ2,B004XC5LHS,Gryphon,"[2, 2]","This is a superb and moving series but be sure that you watch the ending all the way through as it occurs AFTER the final credits roll on the last episode.  The series is seemingly typical and shallow at first, but it is actually deceptively subtle in that it starts out as a wild series of outrageous battles all over what appears to be a high school.  Only thing is that this school is located in the afterlife (limbo? purgatory? the twilight zone?) and you can only get there by being young and dead.It takes the main character, Otonashi, a little while to fully realize and accept the fact that he is really dead and caught in some kind of surreal afterlife where he is swept up into a group of students who are apparently fighting a war against God and an angel with some pretty heavy weaponry like .50 cal rifles, pistols, machine guns, grenades etc.  Otonashi also finds out at the very start that even though you are dead, you can still get  ""killed"" again in this weird reality but you come back to life after a while. Only thing is, even though you don't stay dead, every time you get killed it's brutally and painfully unpleasant and there are lots of ways for you to get killed again and again.But the true core of this series begins to unfold layer by layer, like an onion being peeled, as Otonashi begins to form bonds with the other students in the group fighting a mysterious war against the powers that control this world.  Along the way through the furious battles and self-searching of the individual characters you see the development of wonderful relationships and some really profound questions on life vs. existence, reincarnation, love, God, and what makes a person's life qualify as truly worthwhile and fulfilling.  There are many moving moments as you see relationships develop and blossom among the characters and learn about their pasts as they learn about each other.This superb series is all too short and leaves you wishing there was another season but the pacing and length are actually perfect for how the series resolves. Just be sure you watch ALL of the ending which actually occurs after the final credits in the last episode.The English dub is pretty good and the music, artwork and animation are topnotch.This is a worthy addition to any anime fan's library.",5,"More than the sum of it parts, it is a unique, subtle and surreal but profound series",1346457600,"09 1, 2012",2012,2298,"['superb', 'moving', 'series', 'be', 'sure', 'watch', 'ending', 'way', 'AFTER', 'final', 'credits', 'roll', 'last', 'episode', 'series', 'seemingly', 'typical', 'shallow', 'first', 'actually', 'deceptively', 'subtle', 'out', 'wild', 'series', 'outrageous', 'battles', 'what', 'be', 'high', 'school', 'Only', 'thing', 'school', 'located', 'afterlife', 'limbo', 'purgatory', 'twilight', 'zone', 'can', 'only', 'get', 'there', 'being', 'young', 'dead.It', 'main', 'character', 'Otonashi', 'little', 'while', 'fully', 'realize', 'accept', 'fact', 'really', 'dead', 'caught', 'kind', 'surreal', 'afterlife', 'where', 'swept', 'up', 'group', 'students', 'who', 'are', 'apparently', 'fighting', 'war', 'God', 'angel', 'pretty', 'heavy', 'weaponry', '.50', 'cal', 'rifles', 'pistols', 'machine', 'guns', 'grenades', 'etc', 'Otonashi', 'also', 'out', 'very', 'start', 'even', 'are', 'dead', 'can', 'still', 'get', 'killed', 'again', 'weird', 'reality', 'come', 'back', 'life', 'while', 'Only', 'thing', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'stay', 'dead', 'time', 'get', 'killed', 'brutally', 'painfully', 'unpleasant', 'are', 'lots', 'ways', 'get', 'killed', 'again', 'again.But', 'true', 'core', 'series', 'unfold', 'layer', 'layer', 'onion', 'being', 'peeled', 'Otonashi', 'form', 'bonds', 'other', 'students', 'group', 'fighting', 'mysterious', 'war', 'powers', 'control', 'world', 'way', 'furious', 'battles', 'self-searching', 'individual', 'characters', 'see', 'development', 'wonderful', 'relationships', 'really', 'profound', 'questions', 'life', 'vs.', 'existence', 'reincarnation', 'love', 'God', 'person', 'life', 'qualify', 'truly', 'worthwhile', 'fulfilling', 'are', 'many', 'moving', 'moments', 'see', 'relationships', 'develop', 'blossom', 'characters', 'learn', 'pasts', 'learn', 'other.This', 'superb', 'series', 'too', 'short', 'wishing', 'was', 'season', 'pacing', 'length', 'are', 'actually', 'perfect', 'how', 'series', 'Just', 'be', 'sure', 'watch', 'ending', 'actually', 'final', 'credits', 'last', 'episode.The', 'English', 'dub', 'pretty', 'good', 'music', 'artwork', 'animation', 'are', 'topnotch.This', 'worthy', 'addition', 'anime', 'fan', 'library']",Angel Beats!

1431750,AAU1RHVZCRCL,B004XC5LHS,Kehnin Dyer,"[0, 0]","This anime series is the one i have seen the most times, right next to Kanon (i guess Jun Maeda is a good story teller :p ) it is really funny and has a very moving story.i don't really want to spoil anything about it because knowing too much about the story would make it less impactful, and i am sure there are many reviews about the story that are much better than anything i could write, so instead i will talk about this release.the video quality is what i would expect from a blue ray release. there is no artifacting, the image is nice with sharp lines and good color. the audio quality is good in both english and japanese.i do start to take issue with this release starting at audio tho. This disk was the first i heard the english voice actors... i usually don't like english over japanese, so you can disregard this if you love english more, but i felt that the english actors lacked the ""hot bloodedness"" to accurately portray their roles for the most part. i understand that some of that has to do with the fact that english really has very little vocal variance compared to japanese, so it makes it less expressive, but for instance the in OVA much of the feeling is just not there. i also don't like some of the changes to the dialogue to make it fit english grammar better. like if a character says ""Cuuuuu~te!"" in japanese it was translated as ""It's so Cuuute!"" while it is more grammatically correct, it isn't uncommon for us to speak incorrectly for emphasis... unless it really is and i just picked it up from anime :pnow that isn't to say i actually love the japanese in this case... the subtitles are really boring, they are the standard yellow bs subtitles. i find that they really take a lot away from the art style when they are so terribly done. so for this release i actually would watch in english probably. perhaps i am spoiled by the fansub community because i first saw this series from the Coalgirls 1080p release. They have very attractive fonts a different one for the op and the rest of the show, And each character has a different colored font shadow that is the same color as their hair. this makes it extremely easy to tell what dialog is whose.i really wish that these companies would put a little bit of effort into their releases. i am glad that i can get this amazing show for so little as opposed to importing, but i think for 40-50$ (and especially 70 which is the MSRP) they could afford to put in more effort than slap all the episodes on a disk.the menu interface is a still image, with no background music. the audio select screen is unintuitive at best and non-functional at worse, and the most special feature there is is a promo video, which is just an advertisement...i mean the japanese releases have behind the scenes information, director interviews, and other songs by GDM.All that being said i do think this show is worth it because it is so good. Even if i had seen the show 5 or 6 times before buying it, i would still say this is a good purchase because it helps ensure other great series get picked up.i just hope funimation gets the next super awesome series.",5,A really fun time,1351123200,"10 25, 2012",2012,3121,"['anime', 'series', 'one', 'i', 'have', 'seen', 'most', 'times', 'right', 'next', 'Kanon', 'i', 'guess', 'Jun', 'Maeda', 'good', 'story', 'teller', 'p', 'really', 'funny', 'very', 'moving', 'story.i', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'want', 'spoil', 'anything', 'knowing', 'too', 'much', 'story', 'would', 'make', 'less', 'impactful', 'i', 'am', 'sure', 'are', 'many', 'reviews', 'story', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'anything', 'i', 'could', 'write', 'instead', 'i', 'will', 'talk', 'release.the', 'video', 'quality', 'what', 'i', 'would', 'expect', 'blue', 'ray', 'release', 'artifacting', 'image', 'nice', 'sharp', 'lines', 'good', 'color', 'audio', 'quality', 'good', 'english', 'japanese.i', 'do', 'start', 'take', 'issue', 'release', 'starting', 'audio', 'tho', 'disk', 'was', 'first', 'i', 'heard', 'english', 'voice', 'actors', 'i', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'english', 'japanese', 'can', 'disregard', 'love', 'english', 'more', 'i', 'felt', 'english', 'actors', 'lacked', 'hot', 'bloodedness', 'accurately', 'portray', 'roles', 'most', 'part', 'i', 'understand', 'do', 'fact', 'english', 'really', 'very', 'little', 'vocal', 'variance', 'compared', 'japanese', 'less', 'expressive', 'instance', 'OVA', 'much', 'feeling', 'just', 'not', 'there', 'i', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'changes', 'dialogue', 'make', 'fit', 'english', 'grammar', 'better', 'character', 'Cuuuuu~te', 'japanese', 'was', 'translated', 'so', 'Cuuute', 'more', 'grammatically', 'correct', ""n't"", 'uncommon', 'speak', 'incorrectly', 'emphasis', 'really', 'i', 'just', 'picked', 'up', 'anime', 'pnow', ""n't"", 'say', 'i', 'actually', 'love', 'japanese', 'case', 'subtitles', 'are', 'really', 'boring', 'are', 'standard', 'yellow', 'bs', 'subtitles', 'i', 'find', 'really', 'take', 'lot', 'away', 'art', 'style', 'when', 'are', 'so', 'terribly', 'done', 'so', 'release', 'actually', 'would', 'watch', 'english', 'probably', 'perhaps', 'i', 'am', 'spoiled', 'fansub', 'community', 'i', 'first', 'saw', 'series', 'Coalgirls', '1080p', 'release', 'have', 'very', 'attractive', 'fonts', 'different', 'one', 'op', 'rest', 'show', 'character', 'different', 'colored', 'font', 'shadow', 'same', 'color', 'hair', 'extremely', 'easy', 'tell', 'what', 'dialog', 'whose.i', 'really', 'wish', 'companies', 'would', 'put', 'little', 'bit', 'effort', 'releases', 'i', 'am', 'glad', 'i', 'can', 'get', 'amazing', 'show', 'so', 'little', 'opposed', 'importing', 'i', 'think', '40-50', 'especially', '70', 'MSRP', 'could', 'afford', 'put', 'more', 'effort', 'slap', 'episodes', 'disk.the', 'menu', 'interface', 'still', 'image', 'background', 'music', 'audio', 'select', 'screen', 'unintuitive', 'best', 'non-functional', 'worse', 'most', 'special', 'feature', 'promo', 'video', 'just', 'advertisement', 'i', 'mean', 'japanese', 'releases', 'have', 'scenes', 'information', 'director', 'interviews', 'other', 'songs', 'GDM.All', 'being', 'said', 'i', 'do', 'think', 'show', 'so', 'good', 'Even', 'i', 'had', 'seen', 'show', '5', '6', 'times', 'buying', 'i', 'would', 'still', 'say', 'good', 'purchase', 'ensure', 'other', 'great', 'series', 'get', 'picked', 'up.i', 'just', 'hope', 'funimation', 'next', 'super', 'awesome', 'series']",Angel Beats!

It is about a world that I would describe best as purgatory. The inhabitants of this world are not there to pay for their sins. They are there b/c their lives ended before they had the chance to enjoy their youth. They are getting a 2nd chance before they pass on.The primary character, Otanashi, wakes up in this world with no memory beside a girl hold a sniper rifle. She tells him he's dead, and convinces him to fight with her gang against a girl called ""Angel"". Angel is the student body president at the school everyone in this world attends. It is her duty to keep order. Some of the students believe that if they obey the rules they will be obliterated and pass on. This is why they fight against Angel. Otanashi learns he has a very special connection with the girl they call Angel.Angel Beats is a sci-fi, action, drama, romance, adventure; all wrapped up into 13 episodes and 1 OVA.

Angel Beats! does not try to answer this question, so much as it offers a hopeful fantasy--children who died in the real world are allowed to finish childhood in a purgatory of sorts.  This purgatory of course exists as a high school, and one only wonders if there are elementary, middle and college dimensions.  The students in Angel Beats! are your typical group of ""outsiders""--since they don't go to class (if they did, they would disappear), they are outfitted in delinquent uniforms, and spend their days exchanging shots with the class president, seemingly a mix between Rei from Eva and Edward Elric from Fullmetal.Angel Beats! succeeds on many different levels--comedy, action, drama, and pathos are masterfully blended, providing a show that is as moving as it is quirky.  The first several episodes focus predominantly on action and humor, and it's these two elements that Angel Beats! arguably does best.  However, as the characters develop, we gain more insight into the lives they led before they died, and get acquainted with the psychic pain each suffers.  The pathos is well executed and never devolves into melodrama, and the series has two alternate endings, each with its own ramifications.  Ultimately, Angel Beats! is a story of consolation: an acknowledgment that the innocent suffer and die, and a hope that somewhere they may have a second chance.

They don't know how they were sent there or why.  All they know is that if they play by the rules, they'll eventually disappear.

This causes a confrontation between them and a girl they call 'angel'.  Because everyone is dead, injuries disappear after a short time.

The action is there to add variety, but the action is obviously an afterthought in the story.

1431760,A1727N2JSNT6V7,B004XC5LHS,Natalie casaburi,"[1, 1]","Angle Beats was an anime i checked out form mere curiosity. It was only thirteen episodes and the art work attracted me to it. I finished it recently and i've got to say one of the bets anime's out there.Pot summary: Teenager Yuzuru Otonashi wakes up in the nighttime, at a school like environment and has no recollection of what happened to him or why he is where is his..oh and did i mention he's actually dead? That's right this anime's about otonashi meeting a bunch of other young spirit's like him in purgatory/ limbo. If you don't stay there you ""disappear"" and are gone from the world forever, your destination? nobody knows and it scares them into forming a group called the S.S. battlefront to stay in limbo. There's a lot more to it then this but i don't want to give the slightest spoilers away. The plot is something i didn't expect and is very original in my opinion.Plot review: I admit i may not have given the bets description of what this anime is like so let me describe it to you: it's funny, has some action, romance, but mostly drama and stories about how some of these young spirits died. I always got my heart strings pulled when watching a flash back scene because they were all so sad and horrible. I didn't care much for the first two episodes but by episode 3 i realized this anime was something special indeed, and by episode 5 or 6 i was hooked. It wraps itself up nicely with an ending that can make anyone cry there eyes out i believe.Flaws to the plot: angle beats has a few slight flaws plot wise: some scenes felt rushed but never forced, this is only 13 episodes and is meant to be short, sweet ( or sad in this case) and to the point. Also there's one plot hole tot he last episode however i actually found a logical explanation to it. Another thing is misplaced comedy certain episodes focused a bit to much on the little quirky/ funny scenes but they weren't to bothersome. Characters: i'm not going to give you a list of characters so i'll just say what i thought of them. They were so great and realistic, you grow to love them. I felt a special connection with many and they are very well written. The only minor complaint i have is that i wish they gave these tow characters background i wish they did. The characters in this series are very well done.Music: Another thing angle beats excels in is music. The band ""girls dead monster"" in it has some very great music. The two songs: ""My song"" and especially ""My most precious treasure"" get me teary eyed every time i listen. The opening ""My soul your beats is gorgeous and if you look at the translation it fits the plot dynamic perfectly.Animation: As i said before the animation for this one made me want to watch it.

You wind up in a bizarre, Kafkaesque version of limbo designed by God is he/she was a game programmer. We have almost 20 main characters, running the range from the emotionless Angel to the stoner, TK. Much stands out in this series - the writing, the music, and battles.  While the final few episodes do seem rushed (don't skip the end credits of the final episode or you'll miss an important plot wrap-up!), at least they complete the series, and do it well. At only 13 episodes, it's one of the shortest series - I really would have preferred over 20, including an expanded episode based on those final few seconds.There are enough plot twists and turns to require a GPS - you're never bored! The all girl band (with the highly original name ""Girls Dead Monster"") features your typical hot Anime babes, and the music is great - so good in fact that you can purchase the soundtrack (albeit now as a very expensive collectors item.) The music was even in the top of the Japanese music charts.The animation is crafted as well as the music.  Near flawless, entertaining and very realistic.  I'd compare it to Full Metal Panic in style. The main protagonist, Otonashi, is easy to identify with and very realistic - he's one of the best characters I've seen in a while. His unusual ""relationship"" with Angel helps set the tone in the last half of the series. Personally I did not like the way the final episode handles it, but at least we were thrown a bone at the very end. Many people tear up at the final episode - it's that well done.It's definitely in my top 5 anime. There are rumors of a 14th episode, set after episode 13, but this it could be confusion with the OVA- the additional episode set between 4 and 5 called ""Stairway to Heaven"", released after the series was completed.The OVA is basically fluff - it's the most humorous episode in the series, accompanied by a ""Tension Meter"" throughout the episode.

1431773,A94NOJCJCI6PB,B004XC5LHS,Sean,"[2, 3]","Written: July 2011Angel Beats is a thirteen episode anime that follows a group of dead people in what I assume is limbo. It looks good, the plot sounds good, but the anime itself fails in a few respects. Most notably, in the character and story department. Not to say either are bad, they have high points, but especially with the nonsensical pacing of the story, there are problems. Let's take a deeper look.The story of Angel Beats follows a man named Otonashii. He has died apparently and is suffering from amnesia. When he awakens on the other side he meets a girl named Yuri who runs a battlefront fighting against a girl they call Angel. The anime runs through the battlefront fighting Angel, but soon Otonashii finds out how mistaken they were in fighting the poor girl and he helps people understand her as they combat against an even worse foe, shadows that will eat the souls of the Battlefront members.Toward the end Otonashii and Kanade (the angels real name) help pass people on from this Limbo. We learn a huge secret about Kanade and what should have been a startling revelation about Kanade getting a new heart when she was alive, Otonashii's heart, is not explained well enough for me to understand. Kanade was apparently in this limbo before Otonashii and I wonder if perhaps Otonashii had just been a wandering soul while Kanade was in this limbo. The time frame is confusing since Otonashii had to have died to give Kanade the heart, and Kanade had to have died after Otonashii.Beside that there are a few problems with how Kanade knew she could manipulate herself and create abilities through using computers. This is a big part of the show that I guess is supposed to add a matrix-like feel. It just confuses me on how smart she is about this world and how she was there before Otonashii.The ending is heart-warming/wrenching. Otonashii falls in love with Kanade and Kanade tells Otonashii thank you for giving her his heart. In his hands, Kanade disappears. It's a terrible ending, I wish Otonashii and Kanade could have been together and it certainly could bring a tear to the eye. I wish that this ending could have been happier. I'm not going to mark the story down for ending this way, but I wish anime would end happily.Angel Beats has amazing animation. You can tell big bucks went into the animation. The fluid action, the great character design, the amazing backgrounds. It's a very pretty anime. I can't gripe about anything in this department.The music of Angel Beats is not too bad. The opening is okay but not amazing, the ending song is okay, but not amazing. The band within the show, Girls Dead Monster, sounds pretty good and shines as the best part of the shows sound. Sound effects are good and voice actors do a good job of bringing emotion into the characters.I wish I could say the show shines in the character department, but it doesn't, it does an alright job. There are so many characters that you won't get to really know but for one or two quirks, and the characters aside from Otonashii, Yuri, and Kanade are all not too exciting. Sure they bring some comic relief, but you don't feel for them. Maybe a little for the pink haired Yui and other characters who tell how they died and what they want to do to make up for their terrible lives; but otherwise they are bland. And why does Yui have a tail?Otonashii isn't amazing as a character in any respect. He's likeable, he seems to be the voice of reason, but he's also bland. He's just a guy thrown into the middle of a big problem and he wants to fix it. At the end of the show you will feel bad for him, but you otherwise can't help but consider him generic.Yuri is the same way. She's likeable for her past and likeable in general, but she's too much like other characters out there (Haruhi Suzumaya).Kanade is a good character, you can feel for her, but there are just some problems in how quiet she is and none of her background in this limbo-like place is ever explained. She's the best character of the show, but she's still not an amazingly good character. She's merely good. And that's probably because she's the focal point of the anime. It's the same with Homura Akemi from Madoka. As the focal point, she has to be the best and most fleshed out character. Kanade isn't fleshed out much, but she is a good character emotionally and you can invest yourself in her just by feeling bad.It's what I like to call Elfen Lied syndrome. Do terrible things to cute anime girls and you'll get an emotional response.Angel Beats delivers a solid experience full of laughs and tears and decent action. The problem is in the fact that the characters all seem pretty conventional and it's pace is also sometimes tough to understand. There is a lot of seriousness, but when the episodes are just trying to be silly, it feels out of place. The animation and sound are good, the story could have been good if some of the areas were fleshed out a bit more and explained. The characters are not average, they are good, but I can't help but feel like I've seen these characters many times in many different bodies in many different anime. Kanade is the only character who stands out, and as stated, that mostly has to do with the fact she is the focal point of the show and any emotions you invest will more than likely be placed in her.It certainly can be entertaining, but one of the things I think it's lacking is with the pace. I feel that if the series had been extended a bit more, it wouldn't have felt so oddly paced. If there were more episodes dedicated to the characters and not as much the plot it might have helped keep the series balanced and not allow for the few odd episodes about the characters that ruin the pace. It also would have allowed for the background characters to get some more screen time and for us to learn more about them and what their aspirations are, how they died, and things like that.That aside, for what it is, Angel Beats is great. A large, colorful cast of characters, an intriguing backdrop, and what amounts to be a surprisingly heartfelt and compellingly watchable anime.",5,The Spoiler Ridden Review of One of my

""Venom""","[2, 2]","Before I start, my title says OMG because I can't find the words to express how I feel about this show.Like everyone shows, to me, this show deserves NO LESS than 4 stars...IF THAT LOW. I don't want to describe the show to you but I will describe the overall plot. Everyone is dead & stuck in Purgatory (Limbo). They either have the option of fighting to stay in a high school that's used as Purgatory or being Obliterated (pass on or be reincarnated) by the resident Angel. Nobody can die...or at least stay dead...when shot or dealed a lethal blow but they still feel all the pain of the death blow.The show is extremely funny because people die over & over for stupid reason but eventually come back in a few hours. So, you don't feel sad for the death of your favorite character. It will give you the background of characters to explain how they ended up there. So, there will be sad points here & there but not to the point where you'll flow with tears. It's perfectly balanced with sadness & hilarity. Overall, this show is a must have for any anime collection & its good for all ages. Most likely PG rated to me. No fan service & little to no foul language.

1431779,A3UPHTFXGLA4MK,B004XC5LHS,Wreckless,"[1, 1]","This review will never see the light of day, but this series deserves another 5 star. I'm telling you, a solid 5 star rating from 100 reviews on Amazon is saying something.The associated genres are comedy, romance, drama and action, though this is a little ambiguous. I'd call it a ""supernatural slice of life""; realistic characters with realistic issues in a supernatural setting.Almost the entire cast is completely believable, which is rare in this type of anime. Granted, there are dedicated dimwits, but they play the important role of lightening the mood when the plot gets serious... and it will. It will get downright emotional and bittersweet. The protagonist is very intelligent, personable and caring; he's not ignorant or introverted in the slightest, which makes the show refreshing to watch.On to the bittersweet aspect, it is so both in it's final conclusion and as a whole. I was surprised at how well placed the humorous lighthearted moments were; you get a good laugh right when you need it before your torn heart turned into a plain depressed one.We all knew the ending was going to be sad, but there was one curveball in particular I didn't see coming that made me tear up.When it comes to soothing and touching music, this series has the best OST I've heard.You will NOT regret the 300 minutes you spend on this show, and is easy to overlook.
