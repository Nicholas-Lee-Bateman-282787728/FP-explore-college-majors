But, I knew that I needed to kick it up if I was serious about getting fit and losing weight. This workout made me sweat but was not too hard. And, I loved the fact that several of the other walkers were ""real"" people who had lost weight by walking away the pounds. I am encouraged to move up to the four and five mile DVD's.

I mentioned that I have WATP and Express but I found that I was getting really antsy at the 2 mile mark because I was bored. She said this video really mixes it up, throws in a few different moves and the music is louder. She was right, I love this DVD workout. The second mile seems long and your heart rate gets right up there, and I like that Mary Kate gets to lead, it is a nice change.  I also downloaded the .mp3 music files for Leslie's 3 mile workout that is designed to be used with a treadmill or on your own. I turn the sound down on WATP/Express and play the music instead and its like a new workout (and I'm more motivated).

I also have reaped the benefits ofLeslie Sansone: Walk at Home - 5 Mile Fat Burning WalkandLeslie Sansone's Walk At Home - 5 Mile Walk (With Fitness Band)although the very last of these is not favorite. This tape,Leslie Sansone: 3 Mile Weight Loss Walk, is not then the most challenging of DVDs of Leslie's that I have worked out to. Having said that, however, I cannot say that this tape is without merit.First of all, I really likedLeslie Sansone: 3 Mile Weight Loss Walkbecause it featured ""real"" people:individuals who were still noticeably overweight but were doing their best to lose that weight and had already made remarkable progress walking off their excesses. It encouraged me that this tape chose to recognize these people and note the amount of pounds that they had actually lost. Second, it pleased me that Leslie allowed one of her students (Mary Kay) to lead the second mile at the speed walking pace of a 12 minute mile. That was really energizing!  I did break into a sweat and felt really pumped up!  Third, it was wonderful that Leslie used hand weights in both the first and third mile. Finally, I really liked the music, especially the second mile as it was reminiscent of one of my favorite songs inLeslie Sansone's Walk Slim - 4 Fast Miles  (2-Disc Set).I guess the only reason I would not give this DVD a five-star is that it did not include the ""boosted walking"" I have come to love in several of Leslie's other tapes. I participate in 5K races as a walk-runner and the ""boosted walking"" jogging helps get me pumped up to go faster. If that had been included, I think I would have certainly give this DVD a five star!

The ""middle mile"" led by Mary Kay is a much faster pace than the first and third miles, but times out at the same or a little longer in length -- so does that make her mile longer than the other two miles?  Also the music is much louder when Mary Kay takes over, so for those of us who have to exercise with the volume turned way down low, it is hard to hear the cues.  And I have learned to tune out Mary Kay's bounciness - it's almost like a constant jog!  I just watch Leslie.  I love the weights used during Leslie's segment - I use 3# and it adds to the workout.

1082294,A1XJ3M3JTMD3HZ,B000RL21OA,Honest,"[10, 15]","I used to think that the reason that Leslie talks so much is because she wants to keep the walkers from getting bored since the moves are pretty much the same throughout each workout.Now, I know I was wrong. I just think she is egotistical (because I don't want to use the other popular term). What other reason would you give the reins to your sister to lead one of the miles yet continually talk over her, joke and play around with the other walkers (who are trying to pay attention), and try every way you can think to make sure that although someone else is the leader, the attention is still on you?I actually uttered the words, ""Leslie Sansone is crazy"" while I was doing the routine. I was honestly taken aback by her behavior while Mary Kay was leading the 2nd mile. I found it not only distracting but rude and boorish.I just wanted to get that out of the way.On to the music: there were two songs that I'd never heard before but the rest were repeats. Whomever the music director was failed horribly at keeping the music continuous throughout however. There were several music-less moments accented only by the sound of the footsteps of the walkers.Wardrobe: I've never commented on the wardrobe of the walkers but I'm going to in this review. It's been pointed out how Mary Kay has put on a significant amount of weight over the years. It is what it is. However, I wish that whomever was in charge of the wardrobe had taken her size into consideration when they were outfitting the walkers. The top that Mary Kay is wearing is plainly and simply too small. Early in the video, you can see the outline of her navel (the hole) through her shirt. There's also another walker in all black that is in front of the gentleman (Vance)who has on a top that looks like it's hot (in the Texas in summer sense).Workout: There is about 45 minutes of movement and for most people that is good enough to get some type of workout.

I like the group of individuals in the video and I think it's cute that Leslie has her daughter (and niece) working out as well.  The music is pretty good and, for me, someone who walks 5 miles outside at a pretty good pace, I like it.  However, it can be a little ""slow"" and it doesn't kick into gear until you're at mile 2.  HOWEVER, this video has you going from the get go.  There isn't much lag time between exercises and there's not a lot of explanation.  In addition, the addition of the weights (which I wish was used throughout, but I can understand why they are not) makes this a very good workout for those of us who live in cities where it gets 100 plus degrees in the summer and the humidity is dreadful and makes it unsafe to be walking in such high heat.  At least I don't want to be out in that type of weather.The workout worked up a good sweat and I felt VERY satisfied.  Even though I was walking in my home, I felt like I was getting a good work.  I am also working out using a kettle bell program, so between walking 7 days a week and the kettle bell workout 3 of those days as well as pilates, I think this will be just what I will need to shed about 10 pounds before an upcoming trip.

To me, this is so much more visually appealing than the black curtain in the Walk Slim set or the concrete floor and empty industrial look of the Express set. Leslie leads miles one and three, while MaryKay leads mile two (and she has a microphone this time around, so you can hear her!). They are joined by four other walkers: Barb & Stephanie from the Walk Slim series and newcomers Vance & Suzette. Leslie incorporates the use of light handweights at the end of mile one and throughout most of mile three. No weights are used during mile two, which is pretty fast paced (but which does not use any of her boosted walking). Two songs with vocals from the Walk Slim series are re-used here, but the rest of the music was new to me. The cueing by both Leslie and MaryKay is spot on - absolutely no mistakes from either of them.

All of the three segments are equivalent to one mile of walking outside - so it's so beneficial if it's too hot, cold or wet outside.  You start of slow and then go quicker in the second segment.  Then, the final segment is a little slower again because you are focusing more on doing toning for your upper body.All you really need is either weights or little weighted balls and some energy and a little bit of space.

The people in the background look SO genuiinely happy and cheerful!(All except for the one man and a lady on the side - but she tried.) They actually look like they ENJOY all that excercise and their experience truly resonates and translates into mine.I think Leslie is at her best, too.  She is playful but also very encouraging.  My favorite lines ""You don't have to settle for a slow matobolism -NO WAY!""  and ""Don't let muscle waste away"".  Then at the end she reinforces her positive thoughts by softly saying ""you are a healthy person"" and ""you have a healthy body"".

I was pleasantly surprised!!  It wasn't anything I couldn't keep up with, but I was definitely sweating by the start of the second mile. The third mile slows down a bit, but I found that because of using the weights, I was actually sweating even more!  In less than two months, I've gone from a size ten to a size eight.  I talked my mother into trying it because she wants to lose weight, and in just two weeks she's already lost five pounds!!!I'm so happy with the endurance I've gained from doing this video that I'm seriously considering taking up jogging instead of walking when Spring rolls around.
