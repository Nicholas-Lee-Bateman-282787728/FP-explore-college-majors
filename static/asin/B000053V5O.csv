The memory of this film, so broodingly intimate and mysteriously full of tension between the homey and spacious interior of the presbytery (priest's residence) and the forebodingly looming worlds, outside, of crime, of corrupted law and politics, of sacred and secular singing, and of the Italian pop music industry, is very striking. It is very gratifying to be able to see the film as frequently as I desire by means of the particular DVD edition (Picture This! Home Video PTHV-5091, bearing the ISBN 1-893410-22-6, in Italian with English subtitles) which I chose to obtain. Having visited Naples twice in the early 1960s, while in the U.S. Navy, it also is for me a pleasure, as it will be for other viewers, to see in this movie so many images of the city's rather seedy but colourful, crowded, and lively street life.There is constant suspense about what finally begins to transpire by the long-anticipated ending of the film, when disaster is about to befall the brave priest (compromisingly tainted by his ephebophile sexual proclivity) and the boy, Nunzio Pianese, whose whole situation will change as the film progresses. During all this, Nunzio has been attaining pop music star status as a skilled celebrity ""boy singer"" (going by the show-business name of ""Nino Pinis""), his pleasing adolescent beauty enhancing his public appeal, much as it has provoked the priest's illicit love for him.The boy, who, essentially, is developing heterosexually despite his abnormal situation, accedes to the priest's sexual desires from respect and friendship for the adult man rather than from youthful passion or from any incipient homosexual or bisexual orientation on young Nunzio's own part. The city's corrupt criminal forces, and the local government authorities who facilitate in their undertakings, ensnare the priest, having learned of his scandalous sexual activites, in order to end the cleric's reforming efforts against their joint municipal turpitude, and also entrap the boy, whom they manoeuvre into betraying the priest who loves him and who has taken such an interest in furthering his musical attainments.The film ends as the forces against the priest are closing in on him unawares. While some have found the slow development of the motion picture's action tiresome, my perception is that this gradual working out of the plight of the priest and of Nunzio, and of the depiction of the violence and corruption that surrounds them, make the hovering menace of the film's conclusion all the more effective.",4,"An Handsome & Musically Talented Lad Is Caught between a Priest's Sexual Desire, a Corrupt Local Government & Organised Crime",1298764800,"02 27, 2011",2011,2919,"['first', 'saw', 'film', 'Nunzio', 'Pianese', '14', 'anni', 'maggio', 'put', 'eponymous', 'boy', 'first', 'last', 'names', 'back', 'normal', 'sequence', 'title', 'officialdom', 'portrayed', 'prefers', 'marketed', 'English', 'titled', 'Sacred', 'Silence', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'close', 'international', 'gay', 'film', 'festival', 'Images', '+', 'Nations', 'place', 'yearly', 'Montr', 'eacute', 'al', 'memory', 'film', 'so', 'broodingly', 'intimate', 'mysteriously', 'full', 'tension', 'homey', 'spacious', 'interior', 'presbytery', 'priest', 'residence', 'forebodingly', 'looming', 'worlds', 'outside', 'crime', 'corrupted', 'law', 'politics', 'sacred', 'secular', 'singing', 'Italian', 'pop', 'music', 'industry', 'very', 'striking', 'very', 'gratifying', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'film', 'as', 'frequently', 'desire', 'means', 'particular', 'DVD', 'edition', 'Picture', 'Home', 'Video', 'PTHV-5091', 'bearing', 'ISBN', '1-893410-22-6', 'Italian', 'English', 'subtitles', 'chose', 'obtain', 'Having', 'visited', 'Naples', 'twice', 'early', '1960s', 'U.S.', 'Navy', 'also', 'pleasure', 'will', 'be', 'other', 'viewers', 'see', 'movie', 'so', 'many', 'images', 'city', 'rather', 'seedy', 'colourful', 'crowded', 'lively', 'street', 'constant', 'suspense', 'what', 'finally', 'transpire', 'long-anticipated', 'ending', 'film', 'when', 'disaster', 'befall', 'brave', 'priest', 'compromisingly', 'tainted', 'ephebophile', 'sexual', 'proclivity', 'boy', 'Nunzio', 'Pianese', 'whole', 'situation', 'will', 'change', 'film', 'Nunzio', 'been', 'attaining', 'pop', 'music', 'star', 'status', 'skilled', 'celebrity', 'boy', 'singer', 'going', 'show-business', 'name', 'Nino', 'Pinis', 'pleasing', 'adolescent', 'beauty', 'enhancing', 'public', 'appeal', 'much', 'provoked', 'priest', 'illicit', 'love', 'him.The', 'boy', 'who', 'essentially', 'developing', 'heterosexually', 'abnormal', 'situation', 'priest', 'sexual', 'desires', 'respect', 'friendship', 'adult', 'man', 'rather', 'youthful', 'passion', 'incipient', 'homosexual', 'bisexual', 'orientation', 'young', 'Nunzio', 'own', 'part', 'city', 'corrupt', 'criminal', 'forces', 'local', 'government', 'authorities', 'who', 'facilitate', 'undertakings', 'ensnare', 'priest', 'having', 'learned', 'scandalous', 'sexual', 'activites', 'order', 'end', 'cleric', 'reforming', 'efforts', 'joint', 'municipal', 'turpitude', 'also', 'entrap', 'boy', 'whom', 'manoeuvre', 'betraying', 'priest', 'who', 'who', 'taken', 'interest', 'furthering', 'musical', 'attainments.The', 'film', 'forces', 'priest', 'are', 'closing', 'unawares', 'have', 'found', 'slow', 'development', 'motion', 'picture', 'action', 'tiresome', 'perception', 'gradual', 'working', 'plight', 'priest', 'Nunzio', 'depiction', 'violence', 'corruption', 'make', 'hovering', 'menace', 'film', 'conclusion', 'more', 'effective']",N/A

565070,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000053V5O,Grady Harp,"[12, 15]","SACRED SILENCE, an Italian film set in Naples, dares to share the thoughts and words behind the silences that have sequestered the subject of the role of the Catholic Church in cities under the strangle hold of gang viloence.  The mood is set as soon as the film opens, showing the credits and title of the film superimposed on a fence/wall that is suggestive of a prison wall overlooking the city.  Claustrophobia sets in and is rarely diminished throughout the story.  Father Lorenzo is a young, handsome priest in a neighborhood that is beseiged by brutal gang violence at the hands of the Camorra.  Almost incidental to the film is the priest's nurturing young men by giving sanctuary to drug addicts and to Nunzio who finds his only safe bond (in the presence of broken homes, miserable living conditions, fear) to be with Father Lorenzo.  Yes, he is underaged and yes, it is suggested that the priest and the boy have an intamacy forbidden by the church and the macho community/mob.  But the beauty of this relationship overshadows the horrors outside the church doors until the mob attempts to manipulate the priest by the threat of exposing his private life.  The manner in which this is told includes momentary face-front-to-camera vignettes of each of the characters tellings us who they are, where they live, and a bit of their position in the story.  This ""police lineup"" method of storytelling is effective and creates a tension that is only relieved by the music and moments between Father Lorenzo and Nunzio.While this film may not be for everyone, for those who seek more insight into the current Church scandals this story and the sensitivity of its telling will surely flesh out perspective.",4,"A moody, experimental film",1047859200,"03 17, 2003",2003,1709,"['SACRED', 'SILENCE', 'Italian', 'film', 'set', 'Naples', 'share', 'thoughts', 'words', 'silences', 'have', 'sequestered', 'subject', 'role', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'cities', 'strangle', 'hold', 'gang', 'viloence', 'mood', 'set', 'as', 'soon', 'film', 'showing', 'credits', 'title', 'film', 'superimposed', 'fence/wall', 'suggestive', 'prison', 'wall', 'overlooking', 'city', 'Claustrophobia', 'rarely', 'diminished', 'story', 'Father', 'Lorenzo', 'young', 'handsome', 'priest', 'neighborhood', 'beseiged', 'brutal', 'gang', 'violence', 'hands', 'Camorra', 'Almost', 'incidental', 'film', 'priest', 'nurturing', 'young', 'men', 'giving', 'sanctuary', 'drug', 'addicts', 'Nunzio', 'who', 'only', 'safe', 'bond', 'presence', 'broken', 'homes', 'miserable', 'living', 'conditions', 'fear', 'be', 'Father', 'Lorenzo', 'Yes', 'underaged', 'yes', 'suggested', 'priest', 'boy', 'have', 'intamacy', 'forbidden', 'church', 'macho', 'community/mob', 'beauty', 'relationship', 'horrors', 'church', 'doors', 'mob', 'manipulate', 'priest', 'threat', 'exposing', 'private', 'life', 'manner', 'told', 'momentary', 'face-front-to-camera', 'vignettes', 'characters', 'tellings', 'who', 'are', 'where', 'live', 'bit', 'position', 'story', 'police', 'lineup', 'method', 'storytelling', 'effective', 'tension', 'only', 'relieved', 'music', 'moments', 'Father', 'Lorenzo', 'Nunzio.While', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'who', 'seek', 'more', 'insight', 'current', 'Church', 'scandals', 'story', 'sensitivity', 'telling', 'will', 'surely', 'flesh', 'out', 'perspective']",N/A
565071,A30KGYUOZRUCRJ,B000053V5O,Hulka,"[4, 5]","This move presents the viewer with a classic moral conundrum. The plot of the movie is the story of the local Mafia exploiting a Priest's sexual affair with a vulnerable 13 year old boy to derail his grassroots crusade against the Mafia's influence in the neighborhood.This movie is a relatively low budget movie, but brilliantly cast, acted and filmed. Its almost worth watching the movie for the glimpse it gives at the culture and street life of the city of Naples. But some might find movie's rather nuanced treatment of a pederastic relationship offensive.I wonder about the motives of the movie because of the way it depicts the relationship between the adolescent boy and the Priest. We are confused because, unlike in so many abusive stories of pederasty we hear, the young man is not physically coerced or emotionally abused into the relationship but seduced in a caring, affectionate way not so different then that of a normal intimacy. The lonely boy from a dysfunctional family seems grateful for the nurturing attention of the Priest, who seems the responsible mentor in every other way, and he willingly submits to the Priest's seduction. Meanwhile, the Priest begins to preach against the influence of the mafia from his pulpit. But Priest goes too far when he begins to give interviews to the media and organizing public protests. The mafia boss bribes a social service worker to begin an investigation of the relationship between the boy and the Priest. The social service workers relentlessly pursue the investigation, and eventually the boy breaks down and confesses to the police that he had sexual relations with the priest.We are not certain how to feel as the Mafia triumphs over the young Priest. Was the Priests pederasty more harmful then the violence and corruption of the mafia? Are we supposed to gloat in the Priest's downfall at the hands of the Mafia conspiracy against him? Or regret the end of his activism against the mafia?I believe this moral conundrum is the tool the movie uses to compel the viewer to reconsider one's views of pederasty. On the other hand, the movie---unintentionally I believe---illustrates the central criticism of adult-teenager intimacy: the unequal power relationships between adults and adolescents. It is this unequal power relationship that makes sexual intimacy between adults and adolescents inherently manipulative, and ultimately harmful for the teenager.This movie is worth watching, if nothing else but for the high ""soap opera"" style drama that it contains, as well as the glimpse into the street life of Naples. But be forewarned about it's rather unconventional treatment of the subject of pederasty.",4,Disquieting movie about a taboo subject.....,1180396800,"05 29, 2007",2007,2674,"['move', 'viewer', 'classic', 'moral', 'conundrum', 'plot', 'movie', 'story', 'local', 'Mafia', 'exploiting', 'Priest', 'sexual', 'affair', 'vulnerable', '13', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'derail', 'grassroots', 'crusade', 'Mafia', 'influence', 'neighborhood.This', 'movie', 'relatively', 'low', 'budget', 'movie', 'brilliantly', 'cast', 'acted', 'filmed', 'almost', 'worth', 'watching', 'movie', 'glimpse', 'culture', 'street', 'life', 'city', 'Naples', 'might', 'find', 'movie', 'rather', 'nuanced', 'treatment', 'pederastic', 'relationship', 'offensive.I', 'wonder', 'motives', 'movie', 'way', 'relationship', 'adolescent', 'boy', 'Priest', 'are', 'confused', 'because', 'so', 'many', 'abusive', 'stories', 'pederasty', 'hear', 'young', 'man', 'not', 'physically', 'coerced', 'emotionally', 'abused', 'relationship', 'seduced', 'caring', 'affectionate', 'way', 'not', 'so', 'different', 'then', 'normal', 'intimacy', 'lonely', 'boy', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'grateful', 'nurturing', 'attention', 'Priest', 'who', 'responsible', 'mentor', 'other', 'way', 'willingly', 'Priest', 'seduction', 'Meanwhile', 'Priest', 'preach', 'influence', 'mafia', 'pulpit', 'Priest', 'too', 'far', 'when', 'give', 'interviews', 'media', 'organizing', 'public', 'protests', 'mafia', 'boss', 'social', 'service', 'worker', 'begin', 'investigation', 'relationship', 'boy', 'Priest', 'social', 'service', 'workers', 'relentlessly', 'pursue', 'investigation', 'eventually', 'boy', 'down', 'police', 'had', 'sexual', 'relations', 'priest.We', 'are', 'not', 'certain', 'how', 'feel', 'Mafia', 'triumphs', 'young', 'Priest', 'Was', 'Priests', 'pederasty', 'more', 'harmful', 'then', 'violence', 'corruption', 'mafia', 'Are', 'supposed', 'gloat', 'Priest', 'downfall', 'hands', 'Mafia', 'conspiracy', 'regret', 'end', 'activism', 'mafia', 'believe', 'moral', 'conundrum', 'tool', 'movie', 'compel', 'viewer', 'reconsider', 'one', 'views', 'pederasty', 'other', 'hand', 'movie', '-unintentionally', 'believe', 'central', 'criticism', 'adult-teenager', 'intimacy', 'unequal', 'power', 'relationships', 'adults', 'adolescents', 'unequal', 'power', 'relationship', 'sexual', 'intimacy', 'adults', 'adolescents', 'inherently', 'manipulative', 'ultimately', 'harmful', 'teenager.This', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'nothing', 'else', 'high', 'soap', 'opera', 'style', 'drama', 'as', 'well', 'glimpse', 'street', 'life', 'Naples', 'be', 'forewarned', 'rather', 'unconventional', 'treatment', 'subject', 'pederasty']",N/A
565072,A27JAIYP0U9FGH,B000053V5O,PJR,"[0, 0]","Naples stars in this film. It is ""the real Naples"" not merely well photographed but it is essential to the story. This is not the romantic Amalfi Coast. Naples is a remarkably chaotic place where the mob and the church have been part of the culture for centuries. We cannot sit in front of a television screen and pass judgment on people who live there  by our middle class American standards or from media stereotypes.There have been misstatements and misunderstandings that diminish the film wrongly. (I am about the 10th reviewer) First of all let us be clear that this film has nothing to do whatsoever with the Boys of Saint Vincent, the Magdalene Sisters, the Raggy Boy  or other films like Sex Crimes of The Vatican about the nauseating abuses of children that have been entrusted to the Church in orphanages or detention homes, or even the abuses of kids by priests in parishes in  Boston, Ireland, or you name it. These are horrors that all decent people should all try to stay informed about and seek justice. But we should also stay focused on exactly why these many abuses of power and cover ups are so terrible. To mix up this film with that mess only distracts.The only real connection with these last and this film is that the Church has been covering up the abuse of children around the world by its clergy and institutions to protect its image and interests, and that in the case of Italy it has been covering up its cozy dealings with the various mobs like the Mafia to protect its interests. None of this is a secret really, there is plenty written. By coverup I mean they have pretty well kept a lid on the expositions and avoided criminal prosecutions.  So the connection is to the silence of the Church about the abuse issues internationally, and in this case their silent complicity in the corruption in southern Italy.In Naples we are dealing with street-wise kids who can at best make a go of it; and trying to stay happy while breaking all sorts of laws is a way of life. The priest is trying to stay optimistic and true to himself while dealing with a seemingly impossible situation.For all the thanks he gets the boys even beat him up and rob him sometimes and laugh at him, but like an iconic martyr he just keeps going in his faith and mission.  He eventually puts his head on the line by taking on the mob and thus defying the Curia in Rome and shows that he is a person of personal courage and principle.""Being true to himself"" and showing courage includes sometimes getting emotionally and sexually intimate with some of the young street boys. The film makes this seem innocent enough. After all this is Naples, the kids are street wise and we should not forget that it is Europe. The age of consent is 14 in Italy and 13 in Spain, raised a few years ago from 12. Yes, what the priest is doing is technically illegal (the kid is 13), but the film makes us place this technically illegal love against a background of a society in which much of what goes on in daily life is illegal, as it has been for centuries, and the Curia in Rome helps keep it going and the whole system is adjusted to illegality.The kid is not so innocent. He is getting various favors out of the priest in addition to the sex, which he seems to enjoy. He does not seem to reciprocate the deep and idealistic love that the priest has for him. But he does treat the priest as a good friend and shows loyalty to him.The priest for his part goes into some esoteric musings about comparing moments of his love for this boy to his passion to know Christ in the flesh in emotional depth. This is actually a very old theme in Christianity, for example in writings by Fathers of the Church on the Song of Songs in the old Testament, seeking to compare physical sexual love in its irresistible passion and intensity to the passionate love of the religious for Christ. This again is old Europe and not modern suburban America.So why is the priest's love for, and with, this not-so-innocent and certainly not stupid youth singled out by the authorities? It is because he bucks the system when it comes to the rule of the mob and his orders from the Curia in Rome to keep it cool with regard to the mob. Give them the mob bosses their fancy funerals and Christ's blessings and help them keep their images of respectability. Stop denouncing them.And when the authorities come after him it is a horror. They are so self-righteous and duplicitous and keep saying they only want to help the boy. But they really want to get the priest and the boy keeps telling them that he is doing just fine -- and they will not even consider that there may be truth in what he says. They do manage to wear him down and get him to see his ""sweet-deal"" and friendship as wrong and to see the priest from their perspective to be a sexual predator. They are self-righteous and have no  interest in people's individuality and make no effort to respect an intelligent street wise kid or a priest's ability to think for themselves. For that matter they did not give the parents a chance to work it out as a family matter. It was the same-old, same-old of a people, the Southern Italian people, ruled from way back by the mob and the Church and now with the bureaucrats stepping in.PLOT SPOILER!!!!In the end the priest chooses to tell all and be martyred. Whether he believes that what he did was right or wrong we are not told. We are sort of left to compare it with his habit of smoking cigarettes, that he does appreciate is a bad habit. His planned confession is a very provocative point in my opinion. It is sort of ""here I stand, I can do no other."" Like Jesus he will let the evil-doers crucify him if that is to be his fate. This seems consistent with his character. On the other hand should he have tried to wiggle out if he sees the system as corrupt? Is ""father forgive them for they know not what they do"" the right response here even for a devote Christian? Should he have tried to wiggle out so that he could fight the bigger fight against the mob and the Curia? If this had been a Hollywood film I suspect they would have left us with some sense that he would have wanted to have his day in court and perhaps even use that as a soapbox. But there are deep personal and religious and moral issues that hit us when he is planning to confess. These are not things that will strike just anyone, of course. In this sense it raises some difficult and serious issues.There is much more to this film than most of the reviews suggest. It may seem slow, because developing the ""feel"" of life in Naples takes many sequences. The stopping of the action to have characters identify themselves is to say bluntly ""look we are real people who live here in Naples."" I did not find that distracting.  I give this film five stars because it is an unusually brave and carefully well made film that asks us to think rather about and ponder individual circumstances and personalities rather than to just work off of stereotypes -- even at the risk of offending audiences and confusing them by exploring nuances.Again, the portrayal of trying to grow up in ""the real Naples"" was terrific.Compare this film to Ken Russell's The Devils where hysteria over an alleged sexual scandal is used by the Church and civil powers to distract people's attention from far worse goings on.

I think it might have been made as late night filler for television rather than as a serious attempt. If it is a serious attempt, the filmmaker should stop trying to imitate EVERY successful Italian director and develop his own style.

565075,A2GY8ACB6OI1ZF,B000053V5O,"""rousaswgnr""","[6, 11]","The film is a very slow, very skitzophrenic look at the relationship between at gay priest and a 13 year old parishioner.  There are several lines of action and plot running through the film that erupt from no where and adruptly end with the final credits.1) The Camorra/Mafia vs. the Priest.The priest, as any man of the cloth should, begins to refuse to give mass for murderers and other misc. people who've died in the line of crime.  He's had enough with them tearing apart the neighborhood.  Unfortunately, this leads to the expose in the following:2) The pedophiliac relationship.The priest seems to be struggling emotionally with his very physical relationship with the 13 year old boy, Nunzio.  He attempts to formulate spiritual-Biblical reasons for allowing the illicit relationship to continue - perhaps even basing it upon a homoeroticism of Christ.  Things just aren't very clear in the film.3) Expose.The camorra/mafia seek revenge on the priest by sicking the police on him for the affair with Nunzio.  Why not just kill him?  It seems like a very thin plot-device to use to complicate the relationship between Nunzio and Father Lorenzo.  Furthermore, the priest is seen in a compassionate, friendly light - despite the very serious, very wrong issue of the pedophiliac relationship.  The film almost excuses the relationship as 'holy' or 'beautiful'.  It glosses over the fact that Nunzio was pressed by internal struggling and the need for comfort into a sexual relationship when it should have remained platonic or familiar.All in all, the film leaves the viewer confused as to the point.  Hopefully, others can see it and find some enjoyment.  It is a subject that needs to be dealt with more seriously and with more depth.  Sacred Silence is not a good portrayal or examination of the priest/altar boy sex scandals.",2,"Provoking, but ultimately confusing",1088640000,"07 1, 2004",2004,1835,"['film', 'very', 'slow', 'very', 'skitzophrenic', 'look', 'relationship', 'gay', 'priest', '13', 'year', 'old', 'parishioner', 'are', 'several', 'lines', 'action', 'plot', 'running', 'film', 'erupt', 'where', 'adruptly', 'end', 'final', 'credits.1', 'Camorra/Mafia', 'Priest.The', 'priest', 'man', 'cloth', 'should', 'refuse', 'give', 'mass', 'murderers', 'other', 'misc', 'people', 'who', ""'ve"", 'died', 'line', 'crime', 'had', 'enough', 'tearing', 'apart', 'neighborhood', 'Unfortunately', 'expose', 'following:2', 'pedophiliac', 'relationship.The', 'priest', 'be', 'struggling', 'emotionally', 'very', 'physical', 'relationship', '13', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'Nunzio', 'formulate', 'spiritual-Biblical', 'reasons', 'allowing', 'illicit', 'relationship', 'continue', 'perhaps', 'even', 'basing', 'homoeroticism', 'Christ', 'Things', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'clear', 'film.3', 'Expose.The', 'camorra/mafia', 'seek', 'revenge', 'priest', 'sicking', 'police', 'affair', 'Nunzio', 'Why', 'not', 'just', 'kill', 'very', 'thin', 'plot-device', 'use', 'complicate', 'relationship', 'Nunzio', 'Father', 'Lorenzo', 'Furthermore', 'priest', 'seen', 'compassionate', 'friendly', 'light', 'very', 'serious', 'very', 'wrong', 'issue', 'pedophiliac', 'relationship', 'film', 'almost', 'relationship', ""'holy"", ""'beautiful"", 'fact', 'Nunzio', 'was', 'pressed', 'internal', 'struggling', 'need', 'comfort', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'when', 'should', 'have', 'remained', 'platonic', 'familiar.All', 'film', 'viewer', 'confused', 'point', 'Hopefully', 'others', 'can', 'see', 'find', 'enjoyment', 'subject', 'be', 'dealt', 'more', 'seriously', 'more', 'depth', 'Sacred', 'Silence', 'not', 'good', 'portrayal', 'examination', 'priest/altar', 'boy', 'sex', 'scandals']",N/A
