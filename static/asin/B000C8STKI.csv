That's unfortunate. In fact, that's my biggest complaint when it comes to ""family"" movies and movies aimed at kids. I think that a movie should be entertaining first and that any moral should flow naturally from the story, not be forcibly squeezed from it! That being said, this movie was for the most part pleasant and on the verge of actually being entertaining. The unnatural thing about this movie is how the characters decide that baptising Zachary Beaver is so overwhelmingly important. The whole baptism thing is sort of a non sequitur. The only saving grace here is that there was at least a small morsel of humor thrown in every now and then to keep the movie from getting disproportionally serious. In some ways this movie comes across more as a propaganda piece than as an actual attempt at honest entertainment.",2,Somewhat Entertaining,1145145600,"04 16, 2006",2006,938,"['people', 'making', 'movie', 'made', 'decision', 'was', 'more', 'important', 'impart', 'moral', 'be', 'entertaining', 'unfortunate', 'fact', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'when', 'family', 'movies', 'movies', 'aimed', 'kids', 'think', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'entertaining', 'first', 'moral', 'should', 'flow', 'naturally', 'story', 'not', 'be', 'forcibly', 'squeezed', 'being', 'said', 'movie', 'was', 'most', 'part', 'pleasant', 'verge', 'actually', 'being', 'entertaining', 'unnatural', 'thing', 'movie', 'how', 'characters', 'decide', 'baptising', 'Zachary', 'Beaver', 'so', 'overwhelmingly', 'important', 'whole', 'baptism', 'thing', 'sort', 'non', 'sequitur', 'only', 'saving', 'grace', 'here', 'was', 'least', 'small', 'morsel', 'humor', 'thrown', 'now', 'then', 'keep', 'movie', 'getting', 'disproportionally', 'serious', 'ways', 'movie', 'across', 'more', 'propaganda', 'piece', 'actual', 'attempt', 'honest', 'entertainment']",When Zachary Beaver Came to Town

What an adorable little boy.  Reminded me of a nephew of mine.  The movie also had Eric Stolz in it, good as he always is.  It's a cute movie about a boy who is billed as the Fattest boy in the world, that's Zachary coming into town.  It's a movie with a good message about life and innocence.  Give it a try, you won't be dissapointed.",5,quite the surprise,1165276800,"12 5, 2006",2006,449,"['Well', 'knew', 'nothing', 'movie', 'Turned', 'TV', 'was', 'Was', 'captivated', 'Jonathon', 'Lipnicki', 'What', 'adorable', 'little', 'boy', 'Reminded', 'nephew', 'mine', 'movie', 'also', 'had', 'Eric', 'Stolz', 'good', 'always', 'cute', 'movie', 'boy', 'who', 'billed', 'Fattest', 'boy', 'world', 'Zachary', 'coming', 'town', 'movie', 'good', 'message', 'life', 'innocence', 'Give', 'try', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'dissapointed']",When Zachary Beaver Came to Town

The film is a cut above most juvenile fodder with some funny and interesting characters. Amanda Alch is a stand out as a pint sized southern bell!

955646,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B000C8STKI,Todd Smith,"[1, 1]","A cute predictable story based on an old novel, When Zachary Beaver Came To Town is the story of two boys and the summer that changed their lives, which just happens to co-inside with the arrival of the world's fattest boy visiting their small Texas town. This movie isn't bad, but the story is inconsistent and jumps around quite a bit. At times, it seems as thou Zachary is just a quirky side character rather than the focus of the film. Both the young leads are fantastic thou and the young southern belle character was just hilarious. It's a cute movie, it's not going to blow anyone away, but if you're looking for something fun and simple, check it out.",3,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,1361664000,"02 24, 2013",2013,659,"['cute', 'predictable', 'story', 'based', 'old', 'novel', 'When', 'Zachary', 'Beaver', 'Came', 'Town', 'story', 'two', 'boys', 'summer', 'changed', 'lives', 'just', 'co-inside', 'arrival', 'world', 'fattest', 'boy', 'visiting', 'small', 'Texas', 'town', 'movie', ""n't"", 'bad', 'story', 'inconsistent', 'jumps', 'quite', 'bit', 'times', 'thou', 'Zachary', 'just', 'quirky', 'side', 'character', 'rather', 'focus', 'film', 'young', 'leads', 'are', 'fantastic', 'thou', 'young', 'southern', 'belle', 'character', 'was', 'just', 'hilarious', 'cute', 'movie', 'not', 'going', 'blow', 'anyone', 'away', ""'re"", 'looking', 'something', 'fun', 'simple', 'check', 'out']",When Zachary Beaver Came to Town
