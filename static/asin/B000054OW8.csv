It is not meant as a tutorial on how to sign or anything like that.  It's basically introducing children to another language.  This is one of my favorite blues clues, coming in a close second.  It loses out to Blues Clues: Blues Big Musical..... who doesn't love having a show out in the backyard where all your friends will join along!?",5,"My son, the blues clues fanatic",1103414400,"12 19, 2004",2004,405,"['wonderful', 'video', 'introduction', 'basic', 'signs', 'not', 'meant', 'tutorial', 'how', 'sign', 'anything', 'basically', 'introducing', 'children', 'language', 'one', 'favorite', 'blues', 'clues', 'coming', 'close', 'second', 'out', 'Blues', 'Clues', 'Blues', 'Big', 'Musical', '..', 'who', ""n't"", 'love', 'having', 'show', 'out', 'backyard', 'where', 'friends', 'will', 'join', 'along']",N/A

566901,A1LGPBPDGOALKW,B000054OW8,"Monica Beyer ""Signing mom and author""","[14, 14]","My son, at nearly 2 years of age, has been using sign language for one year. He's not deaf, and we've encouraged his communication skills through the incorporation of American Sign Language.Now, as his second birthday looms near, he's taken on a liking for Blue's Clues. What a find this video was! I think it really helps my son to see cartoon characters using sign language. Signs really are a natural extension of our communication with our children (many people - and even babies - naturally gesture when they talk), and it's wonderful to see popular shows like Blue's Clues encouraging this.This video does not claim to teach ASL so don't buy it expecting a sign language lesson. However, they do use signs throughout the first episode and each episode is bookended by Marlee Maitlin, who is a well-known deaf actress. I think it's great as a supplement to your current signing activities as well as a way for your child to see others using signs.Even if your child isn't signing already, this video is sure to get him or her off to a great start. It's never too late to learn.",5,Signing Turns Blue,983232000,"02 27, 2001",2001,1082,"['son', 'nearly', '2', 'years', 'age', 'been', 'using', 'sign', 'language', 'one', 'year', 'not', 'deaf', ""'ve"", 'encouraged', 'communication', 'skills', 'incorporation', 'American', 'Sign', 'Language.Now', 'second', 'birthday', 'near', 'taken', 'liking', 'Blue', 'Clues', 'What', 'find', 'video', 'was', 'think', 'really', 'son', 'see', 'cartoon', 'characters', 'using', 'sign', 'language', 'Signs', 'really', 'are', 'natural', 'extension', 'communication', 'children', 'many', 'people', 'even', 'babies', 'naturally', 'gesture', 'when', 'talk', 'wonderful', 'see', 'popular', 'shows', 'Blue', 'Clues', 'encouraging', 'this.This', 'video', 'not', 'claim', 'teach', 'ASL', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'expecting', 'sign', 'language', 'lesson', 'However', 'do', 'use', 'signs', 'first', 'episode', 'episode', 'bookended', 'Marlee', 'Maitlin', 'who', 'well-known', 'deaf', 'actress', 'think', 'great', 'supplement', 'current', 'signing', 'activities', 'as', 'well', 'way', 'child', 'see', 'others', 'using', 'signs.Even', 'child', ""n't"", 'signing', 'already', 'video', 'sure', 'get', 'off', 'great', 'start', 'never', 'too', 'late', 'learn']",N/A
