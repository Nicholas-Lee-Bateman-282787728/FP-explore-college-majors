1131139,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B0011FLGU6,C. O. DeRiemer,"[10, 15]","With the exception of the first-class performance by Peter Davison as Detective Constable ""Dangerous"" Davies and the occasional glimmer of a murder mystery that might be promising, is there any particular reason to stay tuned to this television series? The writers and the producers, it seems to me, have fallen into the old trap of taking their audience for granted, and at the same time trying to juice up our interest with extraneous bits of sex. Too bad, because the basic idea -- a police detective too self-effacing and too dedicated for his own good -- has all sorts of possibilities. Dangerous, the nickname friends and enemies all call him because he's the least dangerous man they know, is a quiet guy with a well-developed sense of justice. When we met him at the start of the first series, he was determined to solve a years-old mystery, even though his boss, Detective Inspector Aspinall (Rob Spendlove), told him to work on more contemporary crimes. That the murderer turned out to be a long-time, well-liked cop didn't endear Dangerous to anyone on the force. The two coppers he worked with treated him with disdain and contempt. Aspinall vowed that Davies would be the last detective he'd call on to solve anything remotely important. It seemed Dangerous had only one friend, a fey, free spirit named Mod (Sean Hughes). They'd known each other a long time. Even Davies' wife wanted a divorce. As she pointed out to him with venom every time they'd meet, he's too bland, too unexcitable, too...ordinary. The question the writers and producers should have asked themselves back then is how long they thought they could maintain the status quo of relationships.The result is series four, five programs of about 70 minutes each. For viewers new to The Last Detective, the writers give no explanation of why Dangerous is treated with such a mixture of contempt and condescension by his mates, or why the series is titled The Last Detective. For viewers who have faithfully followed this series, we have to wonder why the fact that Dangerous has solved every case he's been on, all of them complex, doesn't seem to register with his mates or his boss. To compensate for the box the writers have put themselves in, they have contrived a steamy reconciliation between Dangerous and his wife. He and Julie (Emma Amos) are back together and Julie has turned love into a schoolboy's favorite daydream. In each of these five programs we have at least one roll in the hay, usually with Julie initiating. Hold on to your hats and your pajama bottoms...Julie is full of happy innuendo and loving looks aimed below Dangerous' waistline. She and Mod have even become great friends, with Mod moving in with them. The writers bring self-conscious comedy relief by involving Dangerous' mates in silly situations, which jars against their behavior toward Dangerous. Even more jarring is the use of Mod in a sex comedy situation that lets us know more than we want about Mod's...er...endowment.The Last Detective, in my opinion, has only two things going for it at this point. First and by far most important is the skill and likeability of Peter Davison as Dangerous Davies. He's such a subtle and engaging actor that he can make Dangerous' acceptance of bullying and putdowns almost believable. He manages...almost...to distract us from sometimes wanting to give Dangerous a kick in the rear. Second, as commonplace as the writers are, they still manage to give us the bones of intriguing murders. They fail to follow through, however, by their constant interruptions featuring Davies and his wife starting a bit of bedtime roly-poly, by laddie fun and games showing how dumb Dangerous' mates are, and by the behavior of his mates and superior toward Dangerous. The extent and nastiness of their behavior, for me, has come to nearly poison the series because it is so pointless now and so predictable.So, Dangerous, let's get your writers and producers killed off in a particularly satisfying way...perhaps by forcing them to watch endless re-runs of Law and Order until they're bored to death. Then maybe with a new creative team we can give this mystery series another chance.",3,Dangerous Davies needs to find a solution to the need for better writers and producers.

1131141,A2D3MKUAP73AUJ,B0011FLGU6,"Darlene Lindsey M ""Darlene""","[1, 2]","Having gone thru Campion with Peter Davison, I was not expecting a well written series. And when I heard the main character's name was ""Dangerous"" Davies, I thought ""o-boy, is this going to be corny"".  What I got instead was good acting, chemistry of characters and story lines 180 degrees out of line for the better than I had seen in Campion.  From the first series on it holds your interest from beginning to end. The Last Detective has a little of everything including pathos, expression of character, chemistry, and that little bit of frailty that is in all of us.  But above all, the best is just the right amount of humor and ""one-liners"" that makes this series immensely enjoyable.  Although this last quality doesn't quite come off in the character Mod it certainly does in the Governor-Davis' chief superior.  He often steals the scenes and blends the perfect combination of cynicism, wit, vulnerability and expression.  The continuing evolution of his character and that of Davis and his wife is wonderful and refreshing.The Last Detective is typical of a British quality production that can never be duplicated in vulgar load ""noise"" of an American cop series whose maxim seems to be if we just keep using four-letter words and keep refering to people's genitals  we can win over an audience(unfortunately with vast American audiences, they seem to be right however).  What you want to do is get series I of the Last Detective first so you get a feel for the evolution of this fine production....Now, if they could only speak English...just kidding.  Although some of the characters outside of ""Dangerous"" Davis himself has a vernacular as thick as a West Virginian, you ""will"" be able to understand what they are saying, trust me.

I almost didn't watch beyond the first episode because I favor heavier fare and this felt rather like a redux of the Murder, She Wrote genre--relatively light in tone, a mystery to solve, a bit of humor and on to next week.But I was wrong. The series *is* rather light. Mod is a gem, the pranks are funny, and we get a steady influx of episodic suspects that range from sinister to clownish. But beyond the mysteries two aspects of TLD make it special: the regular cast is spot on perfect and the writers had the sense to create arcs that continued throughout the series, giving it more than a one-and-done feel.It is the characters and their relationships that drive the series through four seasons, and that keep the viewer coming back. Sure, the mysteries are fun and often titillating but it is Davies' plight and his relationships with Mod, Julie, DI Aspinall, WPC Kapoor and even those losers Pimlott and Barrett that hook you. Davies somehow manages to be victimized yet refuses to be a victim. He manages to be a good person when circumstances beg for him to turn foul. He believes in humanity when it tries to convince him he shouldn't. He respects others, even those who may not deserve it. That is to say, self doubts and all, he is okay with who he is in this world, a damn fine trait. He reminds me somewhat of Christopher Foyle from Foyle's War in that respect.

This production was made by Granada for the United Kingdom's Independent Television (ITV).  It debuted in the U.K. in February 2003, and offers a light-hearted blend of mystery and comedy similaRosemary ar to that ofBlue Murder: Set 4;andRosemary & Thyme - The Complete Series.  It's based on the ""Dangerous Davies"" novels of Leslie Thomas.  This release consists of a two-volume boxed set including five all-new, full-length police procedurals, but, unfortunately, does not come equipped with subtitles, so good luck with the North London accents.Peter Davison (Tristan, inAll Creatures Great & Small: The Complete Series 1 Collection); stars as Detective Constable (only a constable: quite a disgrace!!) in the totally unimportant, totally out of the way North London precinct of Willesden.  He's the last detective his boss would ever willingly assign to a case, and he gets the least promising ones, but he generally does get his man - or woman, as the case may be.  He's a rumpled, galumphing sort, of average looks and seemingly average brain, but he loves his job, and is good at it.  In series 4, his luck has taken a turn for the better: his wife Julie (Emma Amos) has taken him back, though she finds she has to share her house with Mod, his freeloading,quirkster chum (Sean Hughes,The Commitments.)  Hughes brings a lot to his part; it must be said, just as his character brings a lot to the mix:  he's much more than just a sounding board.Episode 1, ""Once Upon a Time on the Westway."" Jimmy (the Gentleman) Vincent, former major crime boss, gets out of jail, and seems to be involved in a daring diamond heist on the same day.  He is soon, however, found floating dead in his pool.  This episode co-stars Roger Daltrey, lead singer of The Who, in a sizable part, with which he does well.  It's full of charm, and paints a lovely, nostalgic, I'm afraid, picture of the London underworld, as it was supposed to be before Jamaican posses, Chinese tongs, and Russian Maffias.Episode 2, ""Dangerous Liaisons.""  The two-week old corpse of reclusive former architect Dominic Sylvester is found, and everyone but Davies assumes it's just business as usual; until, that is, Davies finds a homemade snuff film among the family movies.  Hywel Bennett(Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy) co-stars here, looking, oh well, nothing like his once-upon a time pretty boy self.Episode 3, ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Willesden.""  Bunny Hopper, half of the once almost famous comedy team Bunny & Jules, literally dies onstage in a bingo hall, and what a way to go.  But the postmortem says he'd been poisoned, and, as it soon becomes clear that, true to his nickname, Bunny had led a very busy love life, Davies has plenty of interviewing to do.Episode 4, ""The Man from Montevideo.""  Limo owner Tony Hill is dispatched by being slashed with a broken champagne bottle, an unfortunate end for an ex-pat just back from Uruguay to try to rebuild an English life.  Davies soon finds there's a little matter of a missing two million English pounds in the dead man's past.Episode 5, ""Dead Peasant's Society."" The finding of the body of a man dead behind the wheel of his car, on a soccer pitch, brings Davies to the Lodge of Divine Serenity, a secret, exclusive, all-male society.  Here he finds Leslie Phillips (Chancer - Series 1,) doing his best to impersonate a toff.Davies, as played by Davison, is a character that's easy to take, and so is his series.  He doesn't aim to set the world on fire; neither does the series.
