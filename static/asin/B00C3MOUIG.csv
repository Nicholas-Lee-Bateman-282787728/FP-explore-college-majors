1641721,AAW9LO0LBLBVO,B00C3MOUIG,"M. Stjames ""Crow Passion""","[1, 1]","This was one of the better seasons of The Amazing Race.  The contestants were more diverse than usual and it seemed they went to more interesting locales.  It's funny how some seasons The Amazing Race seems to be a snake pit of vipers out to do one another in but in other seasons everyone gets along fine and solid friendships form.  David, the coal miner, and Mary from Kentucky were the stars of this season. You could see from leg to leg Mary blossom as the world opened up to her.  I also loved the two Korean brothers, Erwin and Godwin.  The producers should choose more ordinary people and not so many Hollywood types and please - enough with the blond teams!  I missed this season when it was aired so it was fun to watch it now one leg after the other.

The DVDs played well and were safely shipped within the U.S.This is a pretty exciting season although any fan can easily predict the winner just after the first few episodes.The tasks were not real easy compared to the recent seasons and this season travelled to quite a few off beaten paths. Overall, highly recommended!By the way, the sound and color are much better than the earlier seasons released on DVDs.",5,Never been disappointed!,1368835200,"05 18, 2013",2013,459,"['have', 'been', 'pleasantly', 'pleased', 'DVD', 'set', 'DVDs', 'played', 'well', 'were', 'safely', 'shipped', 'U.S.This', 'pretty', 'exciting', 'season', 'fan', 'can', 'easily', 'predict', 'winner', 'just', 'first', 'few', 'episodes.The', 'tasks', 'were', 'not', 'real', 'easy', 'compared', 'recent', 'seasons', 'season', 'travelled', 'quite', 'few', 'off', 'beaten', 'paths', 'Overall', 'highly', 'recommended', 'way', 'sound', 'color', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'released', 'DVDs']",The Amazing Race: Season 10
