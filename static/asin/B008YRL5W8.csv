1578747,A3IRBCCB3I5PPD,B008YRL5W8,"Anastasia McPherson ""Bibliophile""","[1, 3]","Lost Girl has been compared to Joss Whedon's Buffyverse, and it does have some of the humor that made Buffy such a delight but is closer in tone to the darkness of Angel and goes beyond that in terms of sophisticated characters, plot arcs, universe and politics. Many reviewers are putting the adults only label on the series due to the fact that the protagonist is a succubus and the series does have sexual zing, but I am adding the adult label because there is enough here for the well-versed fantasy reader and viewer to analyze and enjoy.Season Two continues to develop the world and the politics introduced in Season One but the longer plot arcs and politics of the Fae world get more attention than they did in Season One. There is still a case of the week, but it is less concentrated in the overused plot device of a private or police investigation and more focused on the world of the Fae and the coming war that threatens to destroy not only the Fae world, but the human world as collateral damage.Dyson is still the ""beautiful, broken Wolfman,"" who loves Bo, even though he is unable to feel it thanks to the cost of a favor by the old ones and the attraction and love between the two still sizzles. Less compelling is the relationship between the doctor Lauren and Bo. I can't tell if the actresses don't have chemistry or of the character of Lauren is badly written, but this relationship is the one weak point in the Lost Girl Universe.The supporting characters continue to be a joy from Kenzi, the human sidekick who is stronger than she appears, to Trick, the barkeeper who is also much more than he appears and the Siren who comes from a wealthy family even though he has chosen to be a police officer for the Light Fae. One time characters are also strongly drawn.Is there sex? Sure and as Bo is a succubus, not all of it is heterosexual as her focus is the sexual energy of a person rather than their gender. If you are even a little sensitive to same sex attraction, this show isn't for you, though the lesbian scenes aren't written or played for male titillation. All of the actors and actresses are exceptionally gorgeous, even with their clothes on and the whole thing, plot, character, pretty, short and long story arcs, urban fantasy universe that uses old myths in a new way...all of it makes for some amazing television. Highly recommended to fans of urban fantasy and mythology. I for one am on the edge of my seat for the third season and everyone I have introduced the show to loves it.",5,Characters and Plot Deepen in Urban Fantasy for Adults,1364169600,"03 25, 2013",2013,2517,"['Lost', 'Girl', 'been', 'compared', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'Buffyverse', 'have', 'humor', 'made', 'Buffy', 'delight', 'closer', 'tone', 'darkness', 'Angel', 'terms', 'sophisticated', 'characters', 'plot', 'arcs', 'universe', 'politics', 'Many', 'reviewers', 'are', 'putting', 'adults', 'only', 'label', 'series', 'due', 'fact', 'protagonist', 'succubus', 'series', 'have', 'sexual', 'zing', 'am', 'adding', 'adult', 'label', 'enough', 'here', 'well-versed', 'fantasy', 'reader', 'viewer', 'analyze', 'enjoy.Season', 'Two', 'develop', 'world', 'politics', 'introduced', 'Season', 'One', 'longer', 'plot', 'arcs', 'politics', 'Fae', 'world', 'get', 'more', 'attention', 'did', 'Season', 'One', 'still', 'case', 'week', 'less', 'concentrated', 'overused', 'plot', 'device', 'private', 'police', 'investigation', 'more', 'focused', 'world', 'Fae', 'coming', 'war', 'destroy', 'not', 'only', 'Fae', 'world', 'human', 'world', 'collateral', 'damage.Dyson', 'still', 'beautiful', 'broken', 'Wolfman', 'who', 'Bo', 'even', 'unable', 'feel', 'cost', 'favor', 'old', 'ones', 'attraction', 'love', 'two', 'still', 'sizzles', 'Less', 'compelling', 'relationship', 'doctor', 'Lauren', 'Bo', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'actresses', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'chemistry', 'character', 'Lauren', 'badly', 'written', 'relationship', 'one', 'weak', 'point', 'Lost', 'Girl', 'Universe.The', 'supporting', 'characters', 'continue', 'be', 'joy', 'Kenzi', 'human', 'sidekick', 'who', 'stronger', 'Trick', 'barkeeper', 'who', 'also', 'much', 'more', 'Siren', 'who', 'wealthy', 'family', 'even', 'chosen', 'be', 'police', 'officer', 'Light', 'Fae', 'One', 'time', 'characters', 'are', 'also', 'strongly', 'drawn.Is', 'sex', 'Sure', 'Bo', 'succubus', 'not', 'heterosexual', 'focus', 'sexual', 'energy', 'person', 'rather', 'gender', 'are', 'even', 'little', 'sensitive', 'same', 'sex', 'attraction', 'show', ""n't"", 'lesbian', 'scenes', 'are', ""n't"", 'written', 'played', 'male', 'titillation', 'actors', 'actresses', 'are', 'exceptionally', 'gorgeous', 'even', 'clothes', 'whole', 'thing', 'plot', 'character', 'pretty', 'short', 'long', 'story', 'arcs', 'urban', 'fantasy', 'universe', 'old', 'myths', 'new', 'way', 'amazing', 'television', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'fans', 'urban', 'fantasy', 'mythology', 'one', 'am', 'edge', 'seat', 'third', 'season', 'everyone', 'have', 'introduced', 'show', 'loves']",N/A

1578752,A10NM4PC3209XU,B008YRL5W8,Deevah,"[23, 27]","This Canadian television show about a supernatural world (the Fae) that exists in secrecy among humans is so different from the typical fantasy TV show that it grabbed my attention immediately. It incorporates mythologies and cultural folklores; however, they are the ""Lost Girl"" version of myths and legends. It has characters, action, and escapades that are enthralling and entertaining. The creator and producers have described the series as a supernatural crime drama with light comedy and it definitely lives up to their description.The protagonist of Lost Girl is Bo (Anna Silk), a bisexual succubus that was adopted and raised by human parents. A succubus is a creature that must feed on the ""chi"" (the life force) of humans and Fae to survive; and when injured absorbs the chi and energy created during sexual encounters to heal. Being the modern version of the mythical succubus, Bo feeding or healing from either a male or female is irrelevant because it's all sexual healing to her. Bo accidentally killed her high school boyfriend by draining his chi during her first sexual encounter and it was after this incident that her parents told her she had been adopted. Thereafter, Bo fled from home and everything she had known, living a friendless existence, accumulating a history of chi-drained bodies; moving from city to city and creating a new identity each time.Bo saves a human woman, Kenzi (Ksenia Solo), from a rapist by draining his chi and when she realizes what Bo did for her, the two become instant friends (with Kenzi as Bo's streets-smart sidekick). This kill brings the heretofore unknown Bo to the attention of the local Fae clans. The Fae are powerful supernatural beings that have existed in secrecy among humans since the beginning of civilization, despising and using them for their own benefit. Their world is divided into two clans, the Light and Dark, with the Dark being the most evil and criminally-inclined of the two; however, although the Light Fae are more diplomatic, both sides use humans as slaves, servants, and food. Bo is abducted by two Fae police detectives and brought to the Light Fae leader, The Ash, for interrogation. It is here that Bo discovers that she is not the only one who is `different'. It is also here that she meets her future romantic lovers, the wolf-shifter and police detective, Dyson (Kris Holden-Ried); and Lauren (Zoie Palmer), the human physician & scientist obligated to serve The Ash. When the Ash orders Lauren (Dr. Lewis) to examine Bo and determine what kind of Fae she is, Bo is told by Lauren that she is a succubus and that, if she wanted to, she could learn to control her chi-feeding power and sexual drive. Each clan wants Bo to align herself with one or the other, but after being forced to defend herself in a contest trial, Bo refuses to abandon her ties to humanity and determines to search for the truth about her origins and who she really is. Rounding the cast of central characters are Trick (Richard Howland), owner and bartender of the local Fae tavern, ""The Dal Riata""; and Hale (K.C. Collins), a siren & police detective working alongside Dyson. Minor characters include The Morrigan (Emmanuelle Vaugier), vengeful leader of the Dark Fae with an instant dislike of Bo; and Vex, a mesmer serving as the henchman for The Morrigan, and a darling of the Dark Fae Elders.The women of Lost Girl are strong, resourceful, and live their lives on their own terms. The interpersonal relationships between men and women are equal in status in spite of their differences. Compared to the sex scenes involving Dyson, the first lovemaking scene between Bo and Lauren may seem tame, but it is nevertheless intense. (Fact: The pilot for the show later became Episode 8 of Season 1, and contains the initial lesbian love scene between Bo and Lauren. Regardless of what naysayers may say, from the outset the relationship with Lauren was intended to be as essential to Bo's emotional evolution as her relationship with Dyson.)Along with the creatures, adventures, rolls in the hay, cleavage, and Bo's intrepid journey to find her place in the world with the family she creates along the way, Lost Girl is very much about a sex-positive universe where sexual orientation is not judged. The core nature of Fae and humans, and their interconnections, are not affected by any one of them being bisexual, heterosexual, or homosexual.Lost Girl is produced by Prodigy Pictures for Canada's Showcase TV network and broadcast by the Syfy TV network in the United States, United Kingdom (UK and Ireland), and Australia. The DVD & Blu-ray contain the unedited episodes as shown on Canadian television (Season 1 has 13 episodes; Season 2 has 22 episodes; Season 3 has 13 episodes). Episodes running time: 44 minutes.Lost Girl is rated TV-MA (Mature Audiences Only) LSV (Language, Sex, Violence) and may be unsuitable for those younger than 17 years of age.",5,A supernatural universe for ADULTS with an awesome heroine -

1578757,A2S29EES9TA9ZM,B008YRL5W8,hredzak,"[0, 0]","In season two, seductive succubus Bo Dennis has established herself as quite the problem solver for the Light and Dark Fae, and she continues to engage with some bizarre creatures.  Bo is growing in her knowledge of herself and her powers of sexually manipulating, healing, and sustaining off the sexual energy of others begins to expand.  The stories in this season are definitely better and even more creative than in season one.  However, the two people who Bo cares about most (Dyson and Lauren) veer off into other relationships, leaving Bo to focus on her heightening (and blah) role with The Fae.  Loved most of the random little stories this season... but the grand Garuda thread/character that leads up to the show's finale was kind of a dud.Season one was all about succubus Bo finding herself and forming her new Scooby Gang family as a P.I. for The Fae... and of course about her very passionate connection with were detective Dyson.  When Dyson loses his ability to love... Bo has to move on.  In season two, this is her transition period.  Rebound, if you will... so I'm glad she spent it somewhat with a Dark Fae dude than with human Lauren.  Then again, from a romantic standpoint... there was nothing more than teasers this season.  No real passion, ultimately.  Although Bo does get another sex scene with Lauren this season... those hoping for a real f/f relationship at last will have to wait until season 3.  But even then, things are questionable.I'm still convinced Bo is a man-centered bisexual, and this is pretty disappointing for me.  I had hoped her interest in both men and women would be at least equal in terms of her emotions and passion.  Nope.  Her biggest passion has been Dyson.  She wasn't left ""hungry"" with him... primarily because he has a wild wolf's passion for her and apparently she feeds off that extreme entirely.  And yet, when Dyson isn't in the picture, who does she run to when she needs to feed off sexual energy and have full on sex?  Men.Like season one, Bo and Lauren get one night together in season 2 before the plot cuts in and leaves them separated.  Really?  Just one time??  Not only is this annoying when you want to see her play out a f/f connection (or even have a juicy f/f affair that lasts more than one boink)... but the conflicts that arise to immediately dissolve the f/f connections show some serious inconsistencies in characterization.  One minute Lauren is passionate for Bo, the next she closes down.  What?  And it won't be the first... or second or even third time!!!  I swear too much about their connection and conflicts just insults my logic.  They have great chemistry when they aren't finding a way to stay apart... but I really wish some better writing would go into the Bo/Lauren thread.  I guess I'll have to wait for Bo to find a female were (do they come in female?) for her to get a satisfying connection and passion for another woman.  There is also one f/f/m threesome (again) this season while Bo is with her Dark Fae boyfriend, but they don't actually show it (again).  Guess that's even more scandalous than f/f, lol.Okay, that is my f/f rant.Otherwise, the stories are really fun to watch.  I was wow'ed by a lot of the imagination here.  For a show that has little effects and just a few settings... it's the interesting characters and the chemistry they share that truly bring this show to life.  Whoever does the casting for this show is FREAKING awesome!!! lol.Some story highlights this season for me:  the kooky Mongolian Death Worm (E5), the Fae strippers (E7), the Scooby Gang's out-of-body trade with each other (E9), capturing a Jinn (in a ""bottle"") was so creative (E14)... and Kenzi's undercover job in high school (E16) was truly hilarious stuff.  Kenzi is the best sidekick ever!  I didn't care for the Dark Fae, Vex, in season one... but he is totally fun to have around as a key character in this season.  I never get tired of the Dark Fae sense of humor.
