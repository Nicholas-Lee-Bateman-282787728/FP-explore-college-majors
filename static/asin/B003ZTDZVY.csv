1378278,A165QTRGCJVCZZ,B003ZTDZVY,Elton T. Elliott,"[45, 48]","The Gay and Lesbian Film Festival in Durham, NC has done it again.  Last year the film ""Shank"" stood out as a movie that was very unpleasant to watch in many ways because of the extreme violence, but it won many of the audience members over with the interesting storyline, great acting, and great directing that it exhibited.  This year, the first selection that I saw at the festival was ""Eyes Wide Open"".  It was made in Israel and was in Hebrew with English subtitles.  Again, this movie, too, was unpleasant to watch in many ways because it is a story about two orthodox Jewish men who meet and fall in love, a situation that obviously will not sit well with the orthodox Jewish community.  So, I approached the film from the beginning with the thought, ""This story probably won't have a happy ending.""Aaron, the older of the two, starts out already married with four children.  With the death of his father, he has taken over the family business, which is a kosher butcher shop.  One day, a younger man, a yeshiva student comes into Aaron's shop and when Aaron discovers that he doesn't have a job or a place to live, he graciously makes the young man, Ezri, his trainee and assistant and offers him a place to stay in the basement of the butcher shop where his father had sometimes stayed overnight when he ran it.  Aaron is an avid reader and studier of the Talmud and wants to make what he studies in the Talmud a real part of his everyday living.  At first, he sees Ezri as someone upon whom he can practice his good deeds.  But, as weeks go by, with the two men spending so much time together at work and studying the Talmud together, both men develop a strong physical attraction for each other.  At first Aaron acknowledges the attraction they feel, but tells Ezri that it is something they must overcome to become better Jews.  But the attraction becomes so strong that finally even Aaron can't fight it.  He tries to maintain his normal relationship with his wife and children, but he finds himself making more and more time for Ezri and their love-making.  Inevitably, word leaks out to the community about Aaron and this younger stranger who came into town with no family and friends.  With a little background checking, people find out that Ezri was thrown out of his previous community for having homosexual relations with someone in that community and was thus abandoned by that man as a result.  Community members approach Aaron and tell him point blank that he must send Ezri away and resume his life as a family man and as a respected man of the community.  Otherwise, they will stop trading in his shop and stop socializing with him in any way.  Everything within Aaron doesn't want to send Ezri away and he even goes so far as to tell one of the elder Jewish leaders that he was not alive until Ezri came into his life.  I was right; the movie doesn't have a happy ending, but it does pose some very important questions that those who are so opposed to gay and lesbian love need to answer.First, do gays and lesbians choose this lifestyle?  For that matter, do heterosexuals choose their lifestyle?  In my estimation, neither gays nor straights choose their lifestyle.  We are either gay or straight from birth.  It is so much a part of our makeup that the only choice we have is whether to do anything about our desires or to pretend to be something we are not.  If that is true, where is the wrong-doing?  It is true that in this story, Aaron might have been able to have hidden for the rest of his life these desires that were so heinous to his community if Ezri had never shown up, but Ezri did show up and because he did, life with his wife and children could never go back to the way it was before, even if Ezri leaves town.  Ezri has put the gleam in his eyes and the pounce in his step.  What do you think the odds are that Aaron would be on the look-out eventually for another man that would do the same?  I'd say those odds are very good.  A film that plants those questions in our minds, is nothing less than a great film.",5,Another Great Film,1282608000,"08 24, 2010",2010,4057,"['Gay', 'Lesbian', 'Film', 'Festival', 'Durham', 'NC', 'done', 'again', 'Last', 'year', 'film', 'Shank', 'stood', 'out', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'unpleasant', 'watch', 'many', 'ways', 'extreme', 'violence', 'won', 'many', 'audience', 'members', 'interesting', 'storyline', 'great', 'acting', 'great', 'directing', 'exhibited', 'year', 'first', 'selection', 'saw', 'festival', 'was', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Open', 'was', 'made', 'Israel', 'was', 'Hebrew', 'English', 'subtitles', 'Again', 'movie', 'too', 'was', 'unpleasant', 'watch', 'many', 'ways', 'story', 'two', 'orthodox', 'Jewish', 'men', 'who', 'meet', 'fall', 'love', 'situation', 'obviously', 'will', 'not', 'sit', 'well', 'orthodox', 'Jewish', 'community', 'So', 'approached', 'film', 'beginning', 'thought', 'story', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'happy', 'ending', 'Aaron', 'older', 'two', 'out', 'already', 'married', 'four', 'children', 'death', 'father', 'taken', 'over', 'family', 'business', 'kosher', 'butcher', 'shop', 'One', 'day', 'younger', 'man', 'yeshiva', 'student', 'Aaron', 'shop', 'when', 'Aaron', ""n't"", 'have', 'job', 'place', 'live', 'graciously', 'young', 'man', 'Ezri', 'trainee', 'assistant', 'place', 'stay', 'basement', 'butcher', 'shop', 'where', 'father', 'had', 'sometimes', 'stayed', 'overnight', 'when', 'ran', 'Aaron', 'avid', 'reader', 'studier', 'Talmud', 'make', 'what', 'studies', 'Talmud', 'real', 'part', 'everyday', 'living', 'first', 'Ezri', 'someone', 'whom', 'can', 'practice', 'good', 'deeds', 'weeks', 'go', 'two', 'men', 'spending', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'together', 'work', 'studying', 'Talmud', 'together', 'men', 'develop', 'strong', 'physical', 'attraction', 'other', 'first', 'Aaron', 'attraction', 'feel', 'Ezri', 'something', 'must', 'overcome', 'become', 'better', 'Jews', 'attraction', 'so', 'strong', 'finally', 'even', 'Aaron', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fight', 'maintain', 'normal', 'relationship', 'wife', 'children', 'making', 'more', 'more', 'time', 'Ezri', 'love-making', 'Inevitably', 'word', 'out', 'community', 'Aaron', 'younger', 'stranger', 'who', 'came', 'town', 'family', 'friends', 'little', 'background', 'checking', 'people', 'find', 'out', 'Ezri', 'was', 'thrown', 'previous', 'community', 'having', 'homosexual', 'relations', 'someone', 'community', 'was', 'thus', 'abandoned', 'man', 'result', 'Community', 'members', 'approach', 'Aaron', 'tell', 'point', 'blank', 'must', 'send', 'Ezri', 'away', 'resume', 'life', 'family', 'man', 'respected', 'man', 'community', 'Otherwise', 'will', 'stop', 'trading', 'shop', 'stop', 'socializing', 'way', 'Everything', 'Aaron', ""n't"", 'want', 'send', 'Ezri', 'away', 'even', 'so', 'far', 'tell', 'one', 'elder', 'Jewish', 'leaders', 'was', 'not', 'alive', 'Ezri', 'came', 'life', 'was', 'right', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'happy', 'ending', 'pose', 'very', 'important', 'questions', 'who', 'are', 'so', 'opposed', 'gay', 'lesbian', 'love', 'need', 'answer.First', 'do', 'gays', 'lesbians', 'choose', 'lifestyle', 'matter', 'do', 'heterosexuals', 'choose', 'lifestyle', 'estimation', 'gays', 'straights', 'choose', 'lifestyle', 'are', 'gay', 'straight', 'birth', 'so', 'much', 'part', 'makeup', 'only', 'choice', 'have', 'do', 'anything', 'desires', 'pretend', 'be', 'something', 'are', 'not', 'true', 'where', 'wrong-doing', 'true', 'story', 'Aaron', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'have', 'hidden', 'rest', 'life', 'desires', 'were', 'so', 'heinous', 'community', 'Ezri', 'had', 'never', 'shown', 'up', 'Ezri', 'did', 'show', 'up', 'did', 'life', 'wife', 'children', 'could', 'never', 'go', 'back', 'way', 'was', 'even', 'Ezri', 'town', 'Ezri', 'put', 'gleam', 'eyes', 'pounce', 'step', 'What', 'do', 'think', 'odds', 'are', 'Aaron', 'would', 'be', 'look-out', 'eventually', 'man', 'would', 'do', 'same', ""'d"", 'say', 'odds', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'plants', 'questions', 'minds', 'nothing', 'less', 'great', 'film']",Eyes Wide Open
1378279,AL1WBEKIEPUPE,B003ZTDZVY,"GEORGE RANNIE ""GWRJWMCL""","[14, 16]","If you are looking for a ""gay themed"" film that is ""warm and fuzzy"", where the misunderstood and rejected are eventually accepted and kind of understood with the film coming to a loving happy conclusion (boy finds and loves boy living happily ever after) FORGET this film of ""Eyes wide Open"" because in actuality it's a very sad film telling a very sad tale of misunderstood love indeed.This superb, wonderfully directed and acted film raises the question of what does one do when merely falling in love goes against a person's  beliefs, upbringing, family and friends etc.  This film tells the tale of Aaron who is living as an ultra-orthodox Jew in Jerusalem with his wife and family seemingly on the outside to be happy.  Enter into his rather ""closed"" world Erzi a handsome young man seeking a job which Aaron gives him.  Against all that is important in Aaron's life the two men fall in love and as Aaron states, he becomes alive.  Of course, there are many obstacles preventing them from being happy together.  The major obstacle is the community which is very ""up in arms"" that Aaron, their butcher and pillar in their community is spending so much time with Erzi who is a man ""with a past"".  None of this seems to bother Aaron who seems to think that he can handle it all.  Erzi knows better.In conclusion, all that I can say is that this film will stick to me for a very long time because it is a movie that I found to be very haunting.I must add that the mood of this film is captured beautifully by its photography and the way it is filmed.  The film is set almost entirely in one neighborhood that is located in a rather bleak looking area of Jerusalem that is void of any color only reflecting tones of grey.  There are only a few moments on screen that show any color--when Aaron and Erzi get out of the neighborhood to a stream otherwise, everything including the inhabitants of this shown neighborhood look grey.",5,SAD BUT TRUE,1290211200,"11 20, 2010",2010,1928,"['are', 'looking', 'gay', 'themed', 'film', 'warm', 'fuzzy', 'where', 'misunderstood', 'rejected', 'are', 'eventually', 'accepted', 'kind', 'understood', 'film', 'coming', 'loving', 'happy', 'conclusion', 'boy', 'finds', 'boy', 'living', 'happily', 'ever', 'FORGET', 'film', 'Eyes', 'wide', 'Open', 'actuality', 'very', 'sad', 'film', 'telling', 'very', 'sad', 'tale', 'misunderstood', 'love', 'indeed.This', 'superb', 'wonderfully', 'directed', 'acted', 'film', 'question', 'what', 'one', 'do', 'when', 'merely', 'falling', 'love', 'person', 'beliefs', 'upbringing', 'family', 'friends', 'etc', 'film', 'tale', 'Aaron', 'who', 'living', 'ultra-orthodox', 'Jew', 'Jerusalem', 'wife', 'family', 'seemingly', 'outside', 'be', 'happy', 'Enter', 'rather', 'closed', 'world', 'Erzi', 'handsome', 'young', 'man', 'seeking', 'job', 'Aaron', 'important', 'Aaron', 'life', 'two', 'men', 'fall', 'love', 'Aaron', 'states', 'alive', 'course', 'are', 'many', 'obstacles', 'preventing', 'being', 'happy', 'together', 'major', 'obstacle', 'community', 'very', 'up', 'arms', 'Aaron', 'butcher', 'pillar', 'community', 'spending', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'Erzi', 'who', 'man', 'past', 'None', 'bother', 'Aaron', 'who', 'think', 'can', 'handle', 'Erzi', 'better.In', 'conclusion', 'can', 'say', 'film', 'will', 'stick', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'movie', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'haunting.I', 'must', 'add', 'mood', 'film', 'captured', 'beautifully', 'photography', 'way', 'filmed', 'film', 'set', 'almost', 'entirely', 'one', 'neighborhood', 'located', 'rather', 'bleak', 'looking', 'area', 'Jerusalem', 'void', 'color', 'only', 'reflecting', 'tones', 'grey', 'are', 'only', 'few', 'moments', 'screen', 'show', 'color', 'when', 'Aaron', 'Erzi', 'get', 'neighborhood', 'stream', 'otherwise', 'everything', 'including', 'inhabitants', 'shown', 'neighborhood', 'look', 'grey']",Eyes Wide Open
1378280,A2KWQ64TRHB3YH,B003ZTDZVY,Israel Drazin,"[2, 2]","This is a rather haunting and disturbing film, but this fact by no means makes it bad. In fact it is a very good and gripping film. It explores many conflicts: between homosexual desire and Orthodox Jewish teachings; a wife, children, and years of comfortable marriage vs. a lover; a somewhat open-minded rabbi against the closed-minded views of his congregants; freedom and self determination vs. community values; and extreme religion over enlightenment. Viewers will need to decide if Benjamin Franklin was correct when he said: To be overzealous in religion is to be irreligious.The film's two lovers are a very devout butcher, the son of a highly respected man, living in a poor enclave of meticulously religious Jews in Jerusalem. He shows his religious devotion from the beginning of the film until the end. Yet, he is drawn to a handsome young man who his community considers an evil influence, who they want to drive out to protect themselves and their children.The film, made in Israel, is in Hebrew, but its subtitles are easy to follow. There is only one mistake. When translating the Kaddish prayer, the subtitles translate it as a prayer for the dead. Actually, there is no mention of the dead in the prayer; it is a glorification of God. This error is inconsequential to the film and does not mar it in any way.",5,"While this film is disturbing, it is worth the time to watch it",1323561600,"12 11, 2011",2011,1326,"['rather', 'haunting', 'disturbing', 'film', 'fact', 'means', 'bad', 'fact', 'very', 'good', 'gripping', 'film', 'many', 'conflicts', 'homosexual', 'desire', 'Orthodox', 'Jewish', 'teachings', 'wife', 'children', 'years', 'comfortable', 'marriage', 'vs.', 'lover', 'somewhat', 'open-minded', 'rabbi', 'closed-minded', 'views', 'congregants', 'freedom', 'self', 'determination', 'vs.', 'community', 'values', 'extreme', 'religion', 'enlightenment', 'Viewers', 'will', 'need', 'decide', 'Benjamin', 'Franklin', 'was', 'correct', 'when', 'said', 'be', 'overzealous', 'religion', 'be', 'irreligious.The', 'film', 'two', 'lovers', 'are', 'very', 'butcher', 'son', 'highly', 'respected', 'man', 'living', 'poor', 'enclave', 'meticulously', 'religious', 'Jews', 'Jerusalem', 'religious', 'devotion', 'beginning', 'film', 'end', 'drawn', 'handsome', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'community', 'evil', 'influence', 'who', 'want', 'drive', 'out', 'protect', 'children.The', 'film', 'made', 'Israel', 'Hebrew', 'subtitles', 'are', 'easy', 'follow', 'only', 'one', 'mistake', 'When', 'translating', 'Kaddish', 'prayer', 'subtitles', 'translate', 'prayer', 'dead', 'Actually', 'mention', 'dead', 'prayer', 'glorification', 'God', 'error', 'inconsequential', 'film', 'not', 'mar', 'way']",Eyes Wide Open
1378281,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B003ZTDZVY,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[13, 14]","Such cruelty is unimaginable, but so close to us. We are in a Jewish community in Jerusalem, one of these communities that live by the Torah a life totally locked up in that logic. A man gets married, has children, works all his life, goes to the synagogue every single time it is necessary, celebrates Sabbath, dresses the proper way, speaks proper language, kisses the jamb of the door when he is coming in or going out of a house, apartment or store. That's a very routine-like life that does not accept anything that goes against this routine, these rules, this pre-formatted life. If the man is a butcher his whole life and his family's depend on the community that must be convinced that he is pure, he is no sinner. And sin is all-pervading in this community. The result is sad in many ways: it is absolute solitude right in the midst and the heart of a human community, a solitude that kills the heart and the soul because the only thing that this man may desire is forbidden, and that is love, love from an equal, love from a man, love from another human being made in the image of God. That forbidden love is divine because it brings together two direct representatives of God, sons of God, Adam and Adam, full equality, the supreme desire of love, to love your equal, to love yourself in the other and let the other love himself in you. But that kind of love is banned by the Torah (Leviticus 18:22, ""You must not lie with a man as with a woman. This is a hateful thing."" Leviticus 20:13, ""The man who lies with a man in the same way as with a woman: they have done a hateful thing together; they must die, their blood shall be on their own heads."") But at the same time the butcher Aaron who accepts Ezri under his roof is then in a serious dilemma when the people around him start being menacing and aggressive because in Genesis 19:5-8 it is said: ""They called to Lot, ""Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them."" Lot went outside to meet them and shut the door behind him and said, ""No, my friends. Don't do this wicked thing. Look, I have two daughters who have never slept with a man. Let me bring them out to you, and you can do what you like with them. But don't do anything to these men, for they have come under the protection of my roof."" And this means Aaron has to protect Ezri. But nothing is that simple and Ezri who has no one except Aaron will leave to enable Aaron to live in peace. But Aaron will not be able to live in that peace. The end is sad, very sad. This film is about that kind of bigotry against gay people, or even nothing but gay desire in the name of a law that is in pure contradiction with the famous Lot story that brings God's fire onto Sodom: the people in Sodom did not respect the law of hospitality, and history repeats itself. The people of this community did not respect the law of hospitality either, but God seemingly brought his fire down onto the host and the guest. Sodom upside down in a way, though in perfect order according to the Torah in another way. There could be a third way but it would mean to leave the community, wife, children. But we can wonder if the departing Ezri and the departed Aaron have not done just that. The film is great because it is delicate, slow and entirely introspective to the point of making the story unreal, at least to our eyes that are wide open and can't see no justice in that law of fire. When one was stoned to death in Jerusalem in the old days, he had to be thrown over the wall of the city, he had to dig his own grave in which he was buried up to the shoulders and then the people could stone him to death, at least that's how James, Jesus' eldest brother was executed. Times may have changed but our stoning techniques are maybe less brutal or bloody but they are just as effective.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID",5,When the Torah is the excuse of the bigots,1286064000,"10 3, 2010",2010,3978,"['Such', 'cruelty', 'unimaginable', 'so', 'close', 'are', 'Jewish', 'community', 'Jerusalem', 'one', 'communities', 'live', 'Torah', 'life', 'totally', 'locked', 'up', 'logic', 'man', 'married', 'children', 'life', 'synagogue', 'single', 'time', 'necessary', 'Sabbath', 'proper', 'way', 'proper', 'language', 'jamb', 'door', 'when', 'coming', 'going', 'house', 'apartment', 'store', 'very', 'routine-like', 'life', 'not', 'accept', 'anything', 'routine', 'rules', 'pre-formatted', 'life', 'man', 'butcher', 'whole', 'life', 'family', 'depend', 'community', 'must', 'be', 'convinced', 'pure', 'sinner', 'sin', 'all-pervading', 'community', 'result', 'sad', 'many', 'ways', 'absolute', 'solitude', 'right', 'midst', 'heart', 'human', 'community', 'solitude', 'heart', 'soul', 'only', 'thing', 'man', 'may', 'desire', 'forbidden', 'love', 'love', 'equal', 'love', 'man', 'love', 'human', 'being', 'made', 'image', 'God', 'forbidden', 'love', 'divine', 'together', 'two', 'direct', 'representatives', 'God', 'sons', 'God', 'Adam', 'Adam', 'full', 'equality', 'supreme', 'desire', 'love', 'love', 'equal', 'love', 'other', 'let', 'other', 'love', 'kind', 'love', 'banned', 'Torah', 'Leviticus', '18:22', 'must', 'not', 'lie', 'man', 'woman', 'hateful', 'thing', 'Leviticus', '20:13', 'man', 'who', 'man', 'same', 'way', 'woman', 'have', 'done', 'hateful', 'thing', 'together', 'must', 'die', 'blood', 'shall', 'be', 'own', 'heads', 'same', 'time', 'butcher', 'Aaron', 'who', 'Ezri', 'roof', 'then', 'serious', 'dilemma', 'when', 'people', 'start', 'being', 'menacing', 'aggressive', 'Genesis', '19:5-8', 'said', 'called', 'Lot', 'Where', 'are', 'men', 'who', 'came', 'tonight', 'Bring', 'out', 'so', 'can', 'have', 'sex', 'Lot', 'went', 'meet', 'shut', 'door', 'said', 'No', 'friends', 'Do', ""n't"", 'do', 'wicked', 'thing', 'Look', 'have', 'two', 'daughters', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'slept', 'man', 'Let', 'bring', 'out', 'can', 'do', 'what', 'like', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'men', 'have', 'come', 'protection', 'roof', 'Aaron', 'protect', 'Ezri', 'nothing', 'simple', 'Ezri', 'who', 'one', 'Aaron', 'will', 'leave', 'enable', 'Aaron', 'live', 'peace', 'Aaron', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'live', 'peace', 'end', 'sad', 'very', 'sad', 'film', 'kind', 'bigotry', 'gay', 'people', 'even', 'nothing', 'gay', 'desire', 'name', 'law', 'pure', 'contradiction', 'famous', 'Lot', 'story', 'God', 'fire', 'Sodom', 'people', 'Sodom', 'did', 'not', 'respect', 'law', 'hospitality', 'history', 'repeats', 'people', 'community', 'did', 'not', 'respect', 'law', 'hospitality', 'God', 'seemingly', 'brought', 'fire', 'down', 'host', 'guest', 'Sodom', 'upside', 'down', 'way', 'perfect', 'order', 'according', 'Torah', 'way', 'could', 'be', 'third', 'way', 'would', 'mean', 'leave', 'community', 'wife', 'children', 'can', 'wonder', 'departing', 'Ezri', 'departed', 'Aaron', 'have', 'not', 'done', 'just', 'film', 'great', 'delicate', 'slow', 'entirely', 'introspective', 'point', 'making', 'story', 'unreal', 'least', 'eyes', 'are', 'wide', 'open', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'justice', 'law', 'fire', 'When', 'one', 'was', 'stoned', 'death', 'Jerusalem', 'old', 'days', 'had', 'be', 'thrown', 'wall', 'city', 'had', 'dig', 'own', 'grave', 'was', 'buried', 'up', 'shoulders', 'then', 'people', 'could', 'stone', 'death', 'least', 'how', 'James', 'Jesus', 'eldest', 'brother', 'was', 'executed', 'Times', 'may', 'have', 'changed', 'stoning', 'techniques', 'are', 'maybe', 'less', 'brutal', 'bloody', 'are', 'just', 'effective.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Paris', '8', 'Saint', 'Denis', 'University', 'Paris', '12', 'Cr', 'eacute', 'CEGID']",Eyes Wide Open

You're in a little game of one-on-one,  possibly out on a hike, swimming in a stream pool together, sharing a tent.....when.....Suddenly, you begin sensing a difference in your thoughts about him---maybe even feeling that something similar is occurring on his part.......OR, as in this film's story, you find yourselves in a 2-person workplace, alone and away from the eyes and ears of others, just trying to get the job done.  AND, in helping each other move equipment and work supplies around, you notice your fingers touching in handing off items one to the other.....there is a brushing of arms as you pass.  THEN comes a stillness and closeness in the space you're occupying with this other person.....and those sensations begin magnifying, driving you into a mentally agitated state.....your eyes sweep around, but always return to that other person.....you have to move and nervously pace a bit.....all these things occurring as you feel your senses jumping into overdrive.  Even more, there's a thrumming within your body which is growing.....growing; your skin nerve-ends begin experiencing, like, tiny electrical waves.  Uncontrollably, your eyes are drawn, as by magnets, to those of the other person.....you cannot look away.....and it seems neither can he.  It is now that you find yourself moving toward the one who has become the center of everything happening to you.  At last, in this very instant, the two of you are reaching out with your hands, eyes locked.....FINALLY, they touch........And then it happens.As for some specifics on this movie, at its heartrending core are a main and a secondary lead whose performances could hardly be bettered.  They wonderfully play two men for whom the briefest and smallest of smiles seems the norm for expressing some bit of happiness in their closed-in existence.  Yet there are rare in-public times (but only when they are together) when we witness instances of laughing camaraderie, which seem to lighten their societally controlled lives.  And, yes, there are times we cry for them as we realize their moments of ""bliss"" in coupling are likely to be short-lived.A couple of things to specifically watch for:-- The most heart-stopping moment in the film comes as our main lead is being pummeled, shouted at and questioned by his own religious leader over what's seen as his ""unacceptable relationship and activity"" with another.  Then, of a sudden, Aaron surges back, blurting out:  ""I WAS DEAD......AND NOW I'M ALIVE!""-- A group bullying scene, as the film's last 10 minutes begin, will break your heart.  To this viewer, it not only ""symbolizes"" the beginning of the end (in the very worst sense), but actually ""is"" the beginning of the end.  Watching the eyes and body positions assumed by our leads in these filmed moments will tear you apart----for the realization hits us that a tearing apart is precisely what is happening.There is only one DVD Special Feature to speak of---a Writer / Director Interview (possibly English not being a first language accounts for a less than smooth presentation of ideas).  Consisting of a series of questions asked, they include:  director's background (non-gay and non-religious individual), to include his filmmaking history / the philosophy and thinking behind this film / effect of low budget on sticking to script / political and national implications of the film within the Nation of Israel.  Nothing is provided concerning interrelationship of the two male leads during filming----something that would have been of interest to, at least, this viewer.  Sadly, there is no during-the-film commentary.PS--Never have I hesitated in placing an Excellent film on my shelf of ""Addictives""......still a heavy heart made me waiver in this instance.  Rest assured, though, that's exactly where this production is going.***Meanwhile, why not take a look at a few recent gems: ""Ciao"" // ""Just Say Love"" // ""Plan B"" // ""Patrik Age 1.5"" (out in US

For those who enjoy, respect and appreciate great acting, Eyes Wide Open is a feast for the eyes (no pun intended).Zohar Shtrauss' performance (and character Aaron), in my view, is the cornerstone and centerpiece of Eyes Wide Open. Yes, Ran Danker, as well as other cast members, also performed superbly, but the story's main lens is (metaphorically) Aaron's eyes: his routine, daily struggles, longings and, most importantly, secrets. All characters are portrayed as ordinary human beings, which makes them extremely relatable.Through the camera, the viewer gets to spy on Aaron and see what he does behind closed doors, which kinda feels good and unnerving at the same time; because, none of us would want that kind of disclosure of our deepest secrets and private activities. Yet, it is comforting to know that we are not alone in hiding some part of ourselves from public view.The story has minimal dialogue (which I'm sure those who don't speak Hebrew appreciate), yet each word is like a gem, carefully and elegantly spoken, weaving the entire story together. Eyes Wide Open has a gentle flow, from scene to scene, no time wasted &#8212; every second has depth of meaning, and does not stray an inch from the main plot.Mixing religion and sexuality makes a spicy concoction, not to mention relevant to current global culture's evolution in human rights, freedoms and expression. No matter which angle is taken in examining this film, whether it is analyzed as only art or only political message, Eyes Wide Open stands up to scrutiny &#8212; it has substance, and truth that can't be denied.Trying to create a film that has a relatively controversial story but yet is delicate and elegant in its delivery is an extremely fine line to walk; Eyes Wide Open walks that narrow line with precision, grace and finesse. It is an impressive, brave and commendable accomplishment, with an essence that will stand the test of time.Intentionally or unintentionally, Haim Tabakman has created a classic work within the category of films that present homosexual themes. Eyes Wide Open joins the ranks of other great films that have emerged from Israel &#8212; it definitely made it into my favorites list.",5,quality work,1397952000,"04 20, 2014",2014,2822,"['was', 'completely', 'surprised', 'find', 'out', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Open', 'Haim', 'Tabakman', 'debut', 'feature', 'film', 'watching', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'got', 'impression', 'creator', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Open', 'must', 'be', 'someone', 'who', 'been', 'making', 'films', 'decades', '8212', 'quality', 'work', 'subject', 'matter', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Open', 'arouse', 'most', 'people', 'moral', 'sensibilities', 'viewer', 'overlook', 'film', 'breathtaking', 'cinematography', 'subtle', 'yet', 'powerful', 'poignant', 'soundtrack.The', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'main', 'actors', 'mere', 'bystanders', 'almost', 'silent', 'yet', 'penetratingly', 'intense', 'unforgettable', 'who', 'enjoy', 'respect', 'appreciate', 'great', 'acting', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Open', 'feast', 'eyes', 'pun', 'intended', '.Zohar', 'Shtrauss', 'performance', 'character', 'Aaron', 'view', 'cornerstone', 'centerpiece', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Open', 'Yes', 'Ran', 'Danker', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'cast', 'members', 'also', 'performed', 'superbly', 'story', 'main', 'lens', 'metaphorically', 'Aaron', 'eyes', 'routine', 'daily', 'struggles', 'longings', 'most', 'importantly', 'secrets', 'characters', 'are', 'portrayed', 'ordinary', 'human', 'beings', 'extremely', 'camera', 'viewer', 'spy', 'Aaron', 'see', 'what', 'closed', 'doors', 'feels', 'good', 'unnerving', 'same', 'time', 'none', 'would', 'want', 'kind', 'disclosure', 'deepest', 'secrets', 'private', 'activities', 'Yet', 'comforting', 'know', 'are', 'not', 'alone', 'hiding', 'part', 'ourselves', 'public', 'view.The', 'story', 'minimal', 'dialogue', ""'m"", 'sure', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'speak', 'Hebrew', 'appreciate', 'yet', 'word', 'gem', 'carefully', 'elegantly', 'spoken', 'weaving', 'entire', 'story', 'together', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Open', 'gentle', 'flow', 'scene', 'scene', 'time', 'wasted', '8212', 'second', 'depth', 'meaning', 'not', 'stray', 'inch', 'main', 'plot.Mixing', 'religion', 'sexuality', 'spicy', 'concoction', 'not', 'mention', 'relevant', 'current', 'global', 'culture', 'evolution', 'human', 'rights', 'freedoms', 'expression', 'matter', 'angle', 'taken', 'examining', 'film', 'analyzed', 'only', 'art', 'only', 'political', 'message', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Open', 'up', 'scrutiny', '8212', 'substance', 'truth', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'denied.Trying', 'create', 'film', 'relatively', 'controversial', 'story', 'yet', 'delicate', 'elegant', 'delivery', 'extremely', 'fine', 'line', 'walk', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Open', 'narrow', 'line', 'precision', 'grace', 'finesse', 'impressive', 'brave', 'commendable', 'accomplishment', 'essence', 'will', 'stand', 'test', 'time.Intentionally', 'unintentionally', 'Haim', 'Tabakman', 'created', 'classic', 'work', 'category', 'films', 'present', 'homosexual', 'themes', 'Eyes', 'Open', 'ranks', 'other', 'great', 'films', 'have', 'emerged', 'Israel', '8212', 'definitely', 'made', 'favorites', 'list']",Eyes Wide Open

Aaron, married father of 4 kids, hires an assistant (Ezri) for his butcher shop. For reasons unexplained, Aaron bcomes attached to the young man, and soon things become physical. Eventually thre are rumors in the community, and Aaron comes under ever-growing pressure. The rabbi confronts  Aaron, asks him why he hasn't send the young assistant away, and Aaron responds ""I was dead, and now I'm awake. He's important to me"". You'll have to watch it for yourself how it all plays out in the end.What attracted me to the movie was to see how this ""coming out"" story would be told in the context of the Orthodox Jewish community in which the movie is set, and at that the movie succeeded for me. The film did not convincingly bring the transformation as to how or why Aaron develops these feelings for another man. Still I'd say this is worth checking out.

1378290,AZL8ZFJMYLSV3,B003ZTDZVY,P. Walker,"[3, 6]","Had this films central theme been about religious intolerance or against religion in general, I would have given it 5 stars. It is a perfect example of what happens in a culture when religion becomes more important than the people themselves. The film goes out of its way to show rituals like the washing of hands, dipping in water, and kissing the Mezuzah as being inane, while the religion itself sacrifices the people who practice them. It also reveals the power and control this type of system has over its people, ruling with fear under the guise of faith. As you can clearly see in the film, it creates hypocrisy, witch hunts, self-righteousness, fault-finding, gossip, and hate, as people are subjugated to the belief system and begin policing each other. People are judged and condemned solely on belief and not on truth, facts, or science. It also gives you a clue as to why the religious right would want a religious social structure in America. Imagine controlling or just influencing the belief of the religious mind.I found the odd and unusual acts scattered throughout the film unnerving, insane, and embarrassing. For example, the man walking forward and backward in the same place over and over, and the men rocking and ""preaching"" while facing a wall. Add to this, the mundane debating over scripture and putting up a facade to everyone around you, while at the same time taking note of what they are doing, became laborious. Again I say, imagine controlling or just influencing the belief of the religious mind.The film reveals the victims of this system are not evil, wicked individuals, but people who simply cannot ""fit"" the mold they are being forced into. Israel and Sara are in love, yet she is betrothed (not of her choosing) to a man she doesn't want to marry. Ezri, a young Yeshiva student, has broken up with his lover, a fellow student, who has chosen his religion over his relationship with Ezri. Aaron, an older gay man, who has denied his sexuality for years and is now married with children, forced to face reality when he falls in love with Ezri. These are all threatened with physical harm by the ""morality guards"" if the don't obey and conform and stop their ""sinning"".There is no laughing, no joy, no passion in the film, which comes across as being unremarkable, dull, and sluggish. This may be just a cultural difference or purposeful direction that I don't understand. I kept hoping for some energy between Aaron and Ezri but found their relationship contrived and tedious, lacking a spark. I felt Sara and Israel had more of a connection.

Though Ran has a beautiful kissy face and luscious lips the sexual scenes are stiff and awkward looking...especially their first intimate encounter up on the roof. More revealing dialogue might have helped viewers understand their motives.  After being dumped by another gay man (in denial) the jilted young lover barely has time to recover before he immediately jumps from the skillet into the fire with eyes wide open. This complex relationship needs more time to develop but I guess a small budget doesn't allow a lot of reel time. Did the married man commit suicide at the end?

1378293,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B003ZTDZVY,"Tommy Dooley ""Tom""","[2, 2]","This is one that is hard to place in existing genres. It tells of the story of Aaron Fleischman (Butcher played by Zohar Shtrauss), who is actually a butcher and purveyor of all meats kosher. He is an ultra orthodox Jew whose idea of fun is studying the Torah and being given to unexpected bouts of group `singing'. He is married with kids and is considered by his closeted community to be `righteous'. This is set in Jerusalem in a part of the town where civic pride is a phrase yet to enter their vocabulary; tarpaulins for roofs, graffiti everywhere and just dust on everything.Then one day a young student stumbles into his shop and asks about work, this is 22 year old Ezri (Ran Dankar). He is initially rebuffed, but a later encounter sees Aaron offering Ezri the job. He soon becomes essential to Aarons existence, who now challenges his entire belief system, including religion and home life. Things move on a pace once Ezri has taken Aaron to the springs for `an immersion'. However everyone knows everyone's business and no one is allowed to do as they please. The phrase `no good will come of this' is a recurring theme.There is only minimal background music which adds to the tension that is ever present, especially as rumours of Ezri `the sinner' soon become common knowledge and the `Modesty Guards' get involved. This film has explicit scenes of Torah study, graphic scenes of meat handling and full frontal views of ropey shop fronts. But despite all of that it has a strange energy that pulls you along with it. It is also very brave to have tackled such a subject and all power to Israeli cinema for doing such a great job.It is in Hebrew Yiddish with generally very good sub titles, with a run time of an hour and a half and despite being gay themed, there are no under the duvet action trysts so be warned. I found it engrossing and moving and would recommend to anyone interested in world/gay cinema.",4,"Kosher Meat, Orthodox Jews, Modesty Guards and Huge Beards!",1322006400,"11 23, 2011",2011,1922,"['one', 'hard', 'place', 'existing', 'genres', 'story', 'Aaron', 'Fleischman', 'Butcher', 'played', 'Zohar', 'Shtrauss', 'who', 'actually', 'butcher', 'purveyor', 'meats', 'kosher', 'ultra', 'orthodox', 'Jew', 'idea', 'fun', 'studying', 'Torah', 'being', 'given', 'unexpected', 'bouts', 'group', 'singing', 'married', 'kids', 'considered', 'closeted', 'community', 'be', 'righteous', 'set', 'Jerusalem', 'part', 'town', 'where', 'civic', 'pride', 'phrase', 'yet', 'enter', 'vocabulary', 'tarpaulins', 'roofs', 'graffiti', 'everywhere', 'just', 'dust', 'everything.Then', 'one', 'day', 'young', 'student', 'shop', 'work', '22', 'year', 'old', 'Ezri', 'Ran', 'Dankar', 'initially', 'rebuffed', 'later', 'encounter', 'sees', 'Aaron', 'offering', 'Ezri', 'job', 'soon', 'essential', 'Aarons', 'existence', 'who', 'now', 'entire', 'belief', 'system', 'including', 'religion', 'home', 'life', 'Things', 'move', 'pace', 'once', 'Ezri', 'taken', 'Aaron', 'springs', 'immersion', 'However', 'everyone', 'everyone', 'business', 'one', 'allowed', 'do', 'please', 'phrase', 'good', 'will', 'come', 'recurring', 'theme.There', 'only', 'minimal', 'background', 'music', 'tension', 'ever', 'present', 'especially', 'rumours', 'Ezri', 'sinner', 'soon', 'become', 'common', 'knowledge', 'Modesty', 'Guards', 'get', 'involved', 'film', 'explicit', 'scenes', 'Torah', 'study', 'graphic', 'scenes', 'meat', 'handling', 'full', 'frontal', 'views', 'ropey', 'shop', 'fronts', 'strange', 'energy', 'also', 'very', 'brave', 'have', 'tackled', 'subject', 'power', 'Israeli', 'cinema', 'doing', 'such', 'great', 'job.It', 'Hebrew', 'Yiddish', 'generally', 'very', 'good', 'sub', 'titles', 'run', 'time', 'hour', 'half', 'being', 'gay', 'themed', 'are', 'duvet', 'action', 'trysts', 'so', 'be', 'warned', 'found', 'engrossing', 'moving', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'interested', 'world/gay', 'cinema']",Eyes Wide Open
