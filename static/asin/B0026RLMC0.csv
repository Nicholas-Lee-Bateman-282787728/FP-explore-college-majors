This season IRT went to Alaska's tundra, river and sea ice roads with more scenery and way more treacherous weather conditions. There are no roller coaster roads or avalanches to worry about on Canada's ice roads.

The show follows likeable people who you cannot help but root for (well at least most of them). However it the does have one flaw as a show, it can be a little redundant repetitive. Im sure that is only because we are the viewers and because we're safe and warm at home and not climbing a four thousand foot ice covered pass in a 40 ton truck. For the most part this show is great it is real people doing real work. Its one of the only shows i know of that gives truckers the pat on the back that they have certainly earned. I grew up around truckers so one thing i notice from time to time is they show the wrong truck when talking about a driver. Such as when they are talking about Lisa on occasion they'll show a KW T800 when she drives a KW W900 that is something most viewers wouldn't notice but i figure for a complete review i should mention it.Overall IRT is a great show that will give you hours of entertainment ESPECIALLY if your a trucker/grew up around them/ or intending to be one. This show is worth the money, 4 out of 5 stars, the only reason it is not 5 out of 5 is because it does get slightly repetitive.",4,Good Series With Few Downsides,1352937600,"11 15, 2012",2012,1269,"['Ice', 'road', 'truckers', 'good', 'series', 'certainly', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'driven', 'tractor', 'trailer', 'realize', 'not', 'as', 'easy', 'show', 'likeable', 'people', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'root', 'well', 'least', 'most', 'However', 'have', 'one', 'flaw', 'show', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'redundant', 'repetitive', 'Im', 'sure', 'only', 'are', 'viewers', ""'re"", 'safe', 'warm', 'home', 'not', 'climbing', 'four', 'thousand', 'foot', 'ice', 'covered', 'pass', '40', 'ton', 'truck', 'most', 'part', 'show', 'great', 'real', 'people', 'doing', 'real', 'work', 'one', 'only', 'i', 'know', 'truckers', 'pat', 'back', 'have', 'certainly', 'earned', 'grew', 'up', 'truckers', 'so', 'one', 'thing', 'i', 'notice', 'time', 'time', 'show', 'wrong', 'truck', 'when', 'talking', 'driver', 'Such', 'when', 'are', 'talking', 'Lisa', 'occasion', ""'ll"", 'show', 'KW', 'T800', 'when', 'KW', 'W900', 'something', 'most', 'viewers', 'would', ""n't"", 'notice', 'i', 'figure', 'complete', 'review', 'i', 'should', 'mention', 'it.Overall', 'IRT', 'great', 'show', 'will', 'give', 'hours', 'entertainment', 'ESPECIALLY', 'trucker/grew', 'up', 'them/', 'intending', 'be', 'one', 'show', 'money', '4', '5', 'stars', 'only', 'reason', 'not', '5', '5', 'get', 'slightly', 'repetitive']",Ice Road Truckers: Season 3

1252011,A3373I4II32NA1,B0026RLMC0,Tyler,"[0, 0]","I watched this show on Netflix and was so hooked, I HAD to order the series online! I don't know how anyone could criticize this movie the way it's made. Lisa Kelly makes her debut on the Alaska ice roads--over 450 miles of deadly twists and turns on icy roads, and she is my personal hero with her extreme confidence in taking these risks carrying these loads in sub-zero temperatures, which is something MOST guys won't even do since they feel more intent on watching this show in their comfy lifestyle and don't seem to understand what these truckers face. You pay close attention enough, you'll get white-knuckled yourself just watching the dangers these truckers go through, especially the dangerous Atigun Pass and it's multiple avalanches. The ""Rollercoaster"" part of the road is dangerous enough for me to say, ""No way!!!"" when I think about driving that in a regular car, but here are these amazing people taking that dip every day with a new load weighing tens of thousands of pounds and do it with barely a grimace or a second thought.Hugh ""Polar Bear"" Rowland is back in action with his Canadian style of humor taking the roads as a rookie. I tip my hat to him, saying, ""Not bad!"" when you consider he conquered the roads his own way, but unfortunately, not as the top scorer as he was in the first two seasons, which were done on HIS home turf if you consider the reason why. And the reason also because he had to spend a week training for the risks in what to expect while truckers like Jack Jesse, the Virginian who takes to heavy-hauling on the Dalton Highway like a pro, and Lisa Kelly are already on the roads battling the elements.Alex is one of my personal favorites. I worried about his health probably as much as his family members when he went into the hospital in Season 2 and kept wondering, ""Is he going to recover and truck some more after this?"" But he makes a big comeback in reply to his fans with a big consideration for getting the job done with a smile on his face and that cool goofy laugh of his. 5 stars all the way!
