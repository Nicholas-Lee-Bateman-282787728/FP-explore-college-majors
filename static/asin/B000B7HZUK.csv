936932,A3NQU1649SH0Q4,B000B7HZUK,"Allen Smalling ""Eclectic Reader,""","[6, 7]","This is it!  The long-awaited DVD release of the first (1957-58) season of that perennial middle-class kids' classic, LEAVE IT TO BEAVER, has arrived, and I am both tickled and impressed.  Tickled because the situations and dialog of these sitcom gems are as funny as I remember, if not more so; and impressed at the high level of craft, talent and expertise that went into every episode.Baby Boomers who caught most of the sitcom later during its first run may be surprised to find the Cleaver family in a smaller house than they remember.  Their residence on ""Mapleton"" lasted only the first two seasons, after which MCA and Universal merged, a better outside set became available, and the Cleaver family moved up to ""Pine Street"" or what Desperate Housewives fans would today call ""Wisteria Lane.""  Even so, we can already see the show's large repertory cast starting to firm up:  within the first five episodes we are introduced to pompous Fred Rutherford (Richard Deacon) and daughter Violet, Beaver's pretty rookie teacher Miss Canfield, and no-nonsense but lovable school principal Cornelia Rayburn.  The Farfara brothers, Stanley and Tiger, play Beav and older brother Wally's contemporaries Whitey and Toohey Whitney, respectively.  Burt Mustin is on hand in nearly every episode as ""Gus"" the elderly fireman, and the biggest rat/hypocrite in kids' TV makes his debut, the smarmy and cynical (and immensely funny) Eddie Haskell (Ken Osmond).It's hard to differentiate what makes ""Beaver"" as admired and delightful a series as that other fun-around-the-house family show, ""The Brady Bunch,"" which shares a similar kids'-eye-view of the world.  Perhaps it's that the Brady Bunch children tend to get into trouble as often in bunches of two or three as individually, and the alliances between boys and girls, older vs. younger kids is forever shifting; but in ""Beaver"" the focus, especially in the early years, deals with eight-year-old Beaver's singular difficulties and failures in adapting to an adult-driven world.  Beaver, who has been warned not to lose his haircut money, does just that; and after he and Wally try to cut his hair they introduce what must be Mayfield's first Mohawk.  After receiving an affectionate peck on the cheek from his pretty new next-door neighbor, Beaver is persuaded by that devil Eddie Haskell that her muscle-bound husband is really going to ""mess him up.""  In a later episode, Beaver gets slugged and develops an embarrassing shiner - not from the neighbor, of course, but courtesy of little Violet Rutherford -- whom Beav has accused of ""drinking gutter water.""  Beaver refuses to implicate Violet in the fight, leaving father Ward to believe that his son ran away from a boy-on-boy fight.  Of course, we understand Beaver's gallantry in refusing to hit a girl -- that code was so well accepted in the Fifties that the script with its fine sense of character nuance doesn't have to state it outright.Despite Ward's supposed enthusiasm for corporal punishment (""Boy, my father used to wallop me!"") he and wife June solve their sons' misbehavior with sweet reason and the lightest of punishments.  Not to imply that the script is sticky-sweet.  As a very middle-aged adult I am impressed by the amount of sly adult humor that goes on.  Good playing helps, of course:  Richard Deacon's Fred Rutherford is a study in adult narcissism and keeping up with the Joneses, and of course the prematurely cynical Eddie Haskell's behavior and motivation could inspire reams of psychoanalytic study.  After a typical Beaver misunderstanding, Principal Rayburn, thinking Ward was in the hospital, sends him flowers with a wish that she ""hope[s] to see you back on your feet soon.""  June asks Ward who this woman is and why she had seen Ward off his feet!Indeed, even Beaver aficionados will find June noticeably more clever and pert in this first season than in later years.  Verbally, she gives Ward as good as she gets and in more than one episode, is caught without pearls.  The following year, after the studio merger, Barbara Billingsley's role was deliberately softened and ""feminized,"" the pearls were epoxy-glued on, and June joined the ranks of other complaisant Eisenhower-era spouses like those played by Jane Wyatt (""Father Knows Best"") and Donna Reed (""The Donna Reed Show"").The main bonus feature of this set is the pilot for the show.  There are quite a few differences:  Ward and Wally are played by different actors, Richard Deacon plays the head of the local milk company, and ""Miss Canfield"" plays his secretary.  Jerry Mathers as second-grade Beaver is right on cue, though, along with his unique vocabulary (""'spelled"" instead of ""expelled,"" for instance).  While I object to the silly lunchbox-looking deluxe version, this standard compilation gave me much more than I expected.  Each episode lasts a good 25 minutes, which left time for a teaser, an epilog, and perhaps a touch more plot development than today's skinny 22 minutes.  And a ""season"" of sitcom paralleled the school year, 39 episodes, nine months' worth.  (Today, about 22 is the norm.)  Quality-wise, this restoration leaves in the occasional speck, especially during the end credits, but will satisfy most people.If you're already familiar with ""Leave it to Beaver"" from its original show and many re-runs, I think you'll enjoy this very much.  And if you're new to the series, welcome aboard!  This series could only have come out of the Fifties, but a young boy's struggles to understand the adults' world, and their troubles coming to terms with him, remain universal, no pun intended.NB:  I am indebted to Dave von Pein, Amazon reviewer, for his help in editing this review.",5,"""Ward, I'm worried about the Beaver.""",1139011200,"02 4, 2006",2006,5697,"['long-awaited', 'DVD', 'release',

936933,AYPCUQS6ARWFH,B000B7HZUK,"Andre M. ""brnn64""","[5, 7]","I am SO glad to see this on DVD! I was pleasantly surprised to see this at the friends house the other day and I was like WHOA!When I was a child in the 60s and 70s, just about every city showed this in syndication, usually right after school. Kids loved Beaver because most kids could identify with the fear of having your parents find out that you unintentionally messed up, although Ward and June never took a strap to young Theodore Cleaver. Today's generation is not likely to know about this, as I don't recall it being on television (aside from TV Land) since about 1984.But this is a cool set. It includes the rare pilot, which has another actor as Ward Cleaver, which is a bit jarring. We see Beav in a couple of standout episodes, such as where he ""exploits"" (Ward's word) his friends by selling water to them when he learns that a walve would be shut off. We also see his shame over getting a Black eye from a girl and the early nerdiness of Clarence/Lumpy (who runs crying ""Daddy"" to his father whenever he faces a problem welll into his teens)and the rakish Eddie Haskell.No, he doesn't fall into the cup and saucer on this set, nor does he encounter the alcoholic handyman, and we don't see Wally and beaver try out their truly 50ish ""ducktail"" haircuts. Those episodes are sure to be in later sets, and they're classic.This was (and is) great TV that kids and adults could still enjoy together, although Beaver's 50s kid talk like ""I'll clobber ya rat"" and ""Clunky girl"" will cause either puzzlement or unintended laughter among today's small fry. Back in the 70s, during the popularity of the faux-50s show ""Happy Days,"" reruns of ""Beaver"" were billed as ""The REAL Happy days.""

936938,AG0TA24LI0XV7,B000B7HZUK,"Baron Sardonicus, Super Genius","[1, 1]","Leave it to Beaver is a product of its time, a wholesome and amusing sitcom. It is not, by any means, hysterically funny, nor is it supposed to be. If I want slapstick I watch Lucy or Gilligan or Jeannie. This show is good, clean, old fashioned family values. It paints an innocent Rockwell image of an America that perhaps once was, one that many people pine for. I suspect that this is the type of world that inspired David Lynch to create his movie ""Blue Velvet"" (white picket fences, smiling neighbors, the ice cream man...)These are such fun to watch just for all the cool stuff that has since faded: rotary phones, milk delivery, malt shops, and so on. Yes, some would call it very 'white bread' or unrealistic. But it's not a documentary, now is it? It's family entertainment from yesteryear.I must say that watching several episodes in a row may not be the best way to view this. It is absolutely staggering that the writers constantly kept going back to the 'Beaver tells a lie' well, and milked that little plot point way too many times. I suppose when it was originally airing, a weekly dose was probably very cute. But, the boy tells a blatant lie every other week, and he never learns his lesson (although he seems to at the end of each episode).Still, it's a hoot to revisit the 1950's style, fashions, traditions, and delightful slang (""Like fun you will!"", Wally snears at Eddie, his pugnosed nostrils flaring). Shows like this are a fascinating time capsule of sorts, although I suspect they're entirely much more squeaky clean than the real experience might be.Now if only we could see a dvd release of another sweet black-and-white gem, ""Dennis the Menace"", with little Jay North and the wonderful Joseph Kearns as good ol' Mister Wilson.

No more truncated episodes, no more soft/pixellated images, no more ads (or pre-emptions) for the likes of ""Chasing Farrah."" Here we just have the Cleaver family, as originally broadcast, with no edits or interruptions to spoil things.The first season isn't my favorite, this is one show that simply got better...but there's enough here to love. The set would almost be worth the money for two episodes alone, the one where poor Beaver tries to give himself a haircut (this crisis hits much closer to home than I'd care to admit), and the one where Beaver and Wally get a job delivering newspapers.There have been many comments about image quality in the set--most notably, grain. The grain is there, and very noticeable, but it doesn't appear to be a mastering error or inferior source material. My guess as to the culprit would be the film stock and/or lighting for scenes shot indoors, as outdoor shots in each episode have no visible grain. This wouldn't have been an issue to worry about in 1957, as no consumer television on the market had sufficient resolution for this anomaly to be visible.This issue aside, there's very little to complain about, except the annoying Universal logo/fanfare that precedes each episode.

It's good to see that it's finally shown up though, and even better to see that the second season is now slated for release too.  It looks like ""The Beav"" escaped the seemingly endless wait between first and second season releases that some shows suffer (Mary Tyler Moore, anyone?)All 39 episodes are here, and they are all the original uncut ABC versions.  They even include the teasers immediately preceeding the opening theme song.  In some cases, the teaser is actually a scene that was not even used in the episode itself, which is quite a treat to see.  Contrary to popular belief, those teasers HAVE been seen since the original airings.  Although they are nowhere to be found on TV Land, I DID see them back in the summer of 1989 on KDNL-TV 30 out of St. Louis.  As I recall, those versions weren't missing very much, as some of them still had the epilogues, too.  But there is NOTHING missing here, and that is a form of bonus material for viewers who've seen nothing but the current syndication airings.  As an added bonus, the original pilot episode is also included here.  It has some different actors in it, and watching it makes you realize how good the final cast was together.  For shows like this, it's always hard to imagine anyone other than the final actors playing the beloved roles, but original pilots such as this often afford us the opportunity to see what could have been, but fortunately was not.The film transfers for the most part look pretty good.  The inside scenes have more grain, but that isn't too distracting and is somewhat expected from films this old.  The outdoor scenes seem to be exceptionally clear, though.  I'm not sure why there is a difference, but there most definitely is and you will notice it immediately.  Despite the minor picture imperfections, you will still glean much viewing enjoyment from this set.If you enjoy classic television or are looking for something that you can let your children watch without having to worry about them seeing or hearing anything they shouldn't, then you can't miss with this set.

You probably would not be reading this now if you didn't already know that. Additionally, one of the Spotlight Reviews did an excellent and exhaustive job of reviewing the show itself. There's little that I could add to it.However, many previous reviewers condemned this box based on bad experiences they had with earlier Universal DVD products ...before this set was actually released. While it is true that Universal releases can leave much to be desired, this particular set is satisfactory. Yes, the discs are double-sided and single-sided would have been preferable. Additionally, the written documentation on the box is slim to say the least. Furthermore, besides the excellent pilot episode, there's little in the way of bonus features here. And perhaps some of the discs may be defective, but isn't that always the case?Of greatest concern however, was the suggestion that the episodes would be shortened to fit. Well that did not happen. In fact, each episode features a brief prologue narrated by Hugh Beaumont before the credits even roll that probably hasn't been seen since the show originally aired. Additionally, each episode clocks in at over 26 minutes each, far longer than anything that has been seen in syndication in recent history.So fear not!

For instance, ""Wally"" and ""Eddie"" having fairly high voices, on the verge of puberty?  Yup.  It must have been the following year and all those that followed that they had their ""normal"" voices.The first year also had a couple of kids in here I didn't recall seeing in the rest of the series, kids like ""Toohey.""  I was disappointed there was no ""Lumpy,"" who didn't arrive on the show until late the following year.  All the kids, though, were great and delivered some really funny lines. Some of the best dialog ever on this show came in the first year.  Actors like Jerry Mathers and Tony Dow were so good that they sounded real, not like somebody acting.Most of the stories deal with the kids getting into some kind of trouble, either through crazy schemes or lying about something (but not maliciously) but all turning out well in the end with good lessons learned.

It's a TV show that, for me, never grows old or tiresome. Wally, Ward, June, Eddie, Lumpy, and ""The Beav"" will always be welcome on my TV screen.This ""Limited Edition"" Lunch Box version of ""Leave It To Beaver: The Complete First Season"" is both fantastic and a nightmare at the same time. The ""fantastic"" part is the TV show itself (and the three discs which have all 39 first-year Beaver entries on them....and the quality is excellent here).The ""nightmare"" part has to do with the way the discs are stored within the Lunch Box, plus the complete and utter lack of ANY printed episode information inside this package whatsoever. No episode guide booklet. Not even a single-page insert with the ep. titles scribbled on them someplace. Nothing. That's just plain crazy.Via this ""Premium"" pack, the only way to find a specific episode you want to view is to physically load up a disc and then search for the program via the Episode Index on the DVD itself. Either that or print out the episode information yourself from an online episode guide or some other source. I guess that WOULD actually be a good idea for people who buy this Limited set.In fact, with the best interests of Beaver fans in mind, I'll provide a quick-reference, disc-by-disc, Season-One episode guide near the end of this review. And if anyone should desire to do so, they can easily copy-and-paste the program list below into ""Word Pad"" (or some similar type of computer word processor), and then print out a copy to put in the Lunch Box for future Beaver reference.Offhand, I cannot think of one other TV-on-DVD product that doesn't come with some kind of program guide, either printed on the box or on an insert/booklet. I certainly don't own a similar such set anyway.The three discs in this set are afforded a very cheap Lunch-Box home, with each one being slid into a CD-like plastic sleeve which comprise the first ""pages"" of the bonus item here, a ""Cleaver Family Photo Album"". The album is a pretty nice supplementary item, with six B&W; pictures of the Cleavers (plus Eddie Haskell) placed into sleeves within the album (same type of sleeves that hold the discs).But, for what's labelled as a ""Premium Edition Gift Set"" by Universal Home Video, I would have expected a much better disc-storing device than just these album sleeves. Sliding them in and out of sleeves could possibly result in the discs getting scratched more easily. Plus, to get the things out of the sleeves, you pretty much have no choice but to touch some portions of the data sides of the DVDs, which isn't too good of an idea either.If only Universal would have made the Lunch Box a tad bigger, they could have easily put the ""Standard Edition"" of the LITB set inside the Lunch Box, which would have been the best of both packaging worlds -- i.e., a ""Limited Edition"", but with normal (and better) DVD cases/trays, which the Standard version does contain. The Lunch Box measures 7.75 in. x 6 in., with a thickness of about 3 inches.The regular/standard edition comes in a nice-looking white slipcase box, which holds three individual slim cases for the DVDs. And, of course, that edition also has episode information written on the back of the cases (plus ""DVD specifications"" such as video aspect ratio stats, Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono, subtitle options, etc., which is also data that is completely absent from the Limited Edition set).So, I'd advise fans of this charming and ultra-likeable TV sitcom to go with the ""Standard"" version of LITB Season 1. It has much better packaging for the double-sided DVDs. I might also add that three of the six photos contained in the Limited Edition's Photo Album can also be found in the Standard pack (with those same 3 pics being shown on the back covers of the three slim plastic cases).Packaging devices aside, I'm extremely pleased with the overall video and audio quality of these DVDs. The Cleaver clan looks just terrific here. It appears to me that Universal Studios has done a marvelous job of transferring these nearly half-century-old TV episodes (which were shot on film, not videotape) to the DVD format. The original ""wet cement"" opening titles appear on each of these 39 episodes, as do the ""teasers"" (i.e., prologues/trailers) that originally aired during these shows just prior to the opening credits. Thank you, Universal, for presenting these programs unedited in any fashion; the average run time here looks to be about 25.5 minutes, which is excellent (in an ""uncut"" sort of way). ;)And Universal has even seen fit to include the ""Pilot"" episode (""It's A Small World"") in this Beaver collection as well (it's located on Side B of Disc #3). The pilot, which was first broadcast in April 1957 as an installment of the syndicated ""Studio 57"" TV series, is a good program too (IMHO), and provides a very satisfactory start to the LITB series (although I must admit that Casey Adams, who portrayed Ward Cleaver in the pilot, doesn't nearly exhibit the charm, likability, and overall greatness that Hugh Beaumont brought to the role in the actual LITB series). Very nice DVD picture quality for the pilot too.Here now is that episode list I promised earlier. For providing the following info that Universal should have included in this Lunch-Box pack in the first place, but didn't, I accept personal checks and most major credit cards.

CAT OUT OF THE BAGBONUS PILOT EPISODE: IT'S A SMALL WORLD--------------------Closing Comments........I've always looked upon the ""Leave It To Beaver"" TV series as an American institution of sorts. Its scripts and storylines were always very simple in nature, but the show never has failed to make me smile. And the entertainment value of the series' inaugural season is increased many times over thanks to the high quality of these DVDs.Even with my many gripes concerning the Lunch-Box packaging, the first season of ""Leave It To Beaver"" on DVD is unquestionably an obligatory purchase for fans of this fun television show.I'd strongly suggest getting the Standard Edition set, however, instead of this Limited Edition pack. And even though I dislike multiple things about the Lunch-Box set, I still feel the need to heap some praise and compliments upon Universal Studios for giving consumers a choice here, and for not releasing LITB Season 1 in JUST the Lunch Box. For being provided a choice of Beaver sets, I salute Universal proudly.",3,"5 Stars (And Then Some!) For The DVDs Themselves ....

I'm NOT going to go into all the details of this DVD set since others have already done so.However, being a perfectionist when it comes to video quality, I will say that the episodes presented in this DVD set, don't look as good as they could have. While the picture quality is sharper than the episodes currently being shown on TV Land, the DVD set  episodes have a ""grainy"" quality. This is most likely because  Universal chose to make this DVD set using 16mm print masters  rather than using their 35mm print masters. Use of the 35mm masters would have yielded a more pristine picture. Unfortunately, Universal went the cheaper 16mm route and it shows.On a postive note, the contrast levels on these episodes are quite good, with good grays and blacks. The prints are for the most part, clean with some looking less ""grainy"" than others. Outdoor shots showed less grain then the indoor shots. These episodes also appear to be unedited...a big plus.

The bad news is that the transfers are full of excessive grain which is very irritating, especially knowing how great an old TV show can be made to look from the fantastic ""I Love Lucy,"" ""Twilight Zone"" and ""Have Gun Will Travel"" collections.  This grainy image quality to me is why I can't recommend the set as a purchase at this price.  The episodes themselves have no chapter stops within them -- not a big deal, but another indication that Universal didn't put a lot of effort into this.  And even more disappointing is the lack of special features.  You'd think that when a show has so many cast members still around, that an effort would have been made to have them do some commentaries or interviews, but such is not the case.  Other reviewers have mentioned that the set is on dual sided DVD-18s which are often problematic.  I haven't had any trouble yet, although I'm not all the way through every episode.  Nevertheless, the choice of DVD-18s instead of single sided DVD-9s (as in the Lucy sets) is another indication that Universal continues to opt for cheapness over quality.If you're on the fence about this set, rent one of the discs and see what you think of the graininess before you buy it.

936978,A3H9JSM1SUTE4O,B000B7HZUK,Robin Simmons,"[1, 2]","LEAVE IT TO BEAVER - THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON (Universal) is the breakthrough TV sitcom from 1957 that gently mocks a middle class, heartland American family with a dad that didn't have all the answers. 39 half-hour episodes on three two-sided discs bring sharp digital versions of the Cleaver clan.  There's young mischievous Beaver, his cool big brother Wally, flawed but well-meaning dad Ward and wise, together mom June.  Oh, and that awful neighbor boy Eddie Haskell, Wally's duplicitous pal.It was an innocent time and the growing pains usually revolved around the dissonance between Beaver and Wally who are about five years apart.  Simple set-ups generate honest yuks.  For instance, Beaver, told not to hurt his baby sitting spinster aunt's feelings is forced to wear short pants she bought for him to wear to third grade.  Or Wally is dealing with a crush on a girl in a dance class and can't take Beaver fishing.I was surprised well this series holds up.  I laughed out loud (and so did my two boys who ""related"") at these retro, gentle, often quirky comic episodes with their comfy back lot exteriors and feel good conclusions.This DVD set is perfect nostalgia for the generation of baby boomers approaching retirement.

Ah, the Cleaver household; one in which I lived growing up in the 1950s...loved them, esp Wally, Beaver and my favorite of all, Larry Mondello. They were all so NATURAL; a FAR cry from most of today's hip-slick-sitcom-kids. They were the real deal; every single one. But somehow Larry appealed to me the most of Beaver's friends. His blue jeans (dungarees back then) with the 18 inch cuff rolled up, his cap and his ever-present whining and insatiable appetite, and of course, Mrs Mondello (she always seemed to be wearing a hat and gloves, even in her own house!) who always went to Ward when Larry acted up: ""He always does this when his father's away and I just don't know what to do with him Mr. Cleaver! Will you talk to him? He'll listen to you.""I liked Eddie Haskell, and Lumpy (a friend of mine was in Palm Springs CA once and saw him driving around with a license plate that read ""I'm Lumpy"") but didn't care much for the assorted girl friends, with one or two exceptions; too giggly and conniving.And Beaver's older friends, later in the show, Whitey and Gilbert were not anywhere near as appealing as Larry, IMO.Ward and June were great; how I wanted to move into the Cleaver household! Just gave me a feeling that nothing could ever hurt or harm me if I was under their roof.When you watch them today, as adults, you realize how vastly superior all the actors were then; a real window into their world, not a stage set with people playing parts.The single show since LITB that rang true (again, IMO) was Roseanne. LOVED those kids, esp Sara Gilbert.One thing always puzzled me; why on earth did they have the Cleavers move? I loved the original clapboard house with all the windows; the newer house just wasn't the same, and then it was used in Marcus Welby MD and others.Oh well, again, thank God we can revisit the Cleaver household and go back to a softer, less complicated time...sometimes you CAN go home again.",5,"""Hey Mom!

Wood ""Film scholar and vintage mov...","[14, 20]","It is so exciting to have the complete first season of LEAVE IT TO BEAVER hitting DVD boxed set on November 22nd.  It has always been my favorite TV series of all time and the one with the fondest place in my heart.  Too dark and serious to be called a comedy, and too light and funny at other times to be a drama, BEAVER is probably best termed a ""dramedy"", a term I loathe.  Like life itself, it can be by turns funny and dramatic, light and tragic.BEAVER comes from a more quiet and gentle era, despite its always offensive laugh track.  Today's sitcoms are filmed on sound stages with studio audiences.  I can remember this being the trend back to when I was part of a 1975 studio audience for ONE DAY AT A TIME.  By contrast, BEAVER was filmed all over Universal City's backlot to give it an anywhere USA town reality.  I grew up in a town a lot like Mayfield.  Considering that the Bates Motel was in use for PSYCHO (1960) during one BEAVER season, while 1930's Georgia was being re-created for TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD (1962) during another season, let's give the BEAVER production designers and set decorators a lot of credit here.  To watch BEAVER is to literally watch my childhood unfold in the small town era 1960's suburbs south of San Francisco.The cast is so immortal here.  Jerry Mathers IS Beaver Cleaver, as are Tony Dow as his older brother Wally, Barbara Billingsley as the much-maligned Mom (if vacuuming the house in pearls is her ""thing"", so be it), Hugh Beaumont as Dad, Frank Bank as Lumpy Rutherford, Rusty Stevens as Beav's best friend Larry (remember the way he always reached for a Cleaver dining table apple), and especially Sue Randall as the lovely Miss Landers (what child would not have a crush on HER?) and Ken Osmond as the incomparable con man Eddie Haskell.  They all live their roles, and I knew people in elementary and junior high who were just like all of them.But most of all, LEAVE IT TO BEAVER is probably always going to be my favorite TV show of all time is because of the reality and truthfulness in its conflicts and dialogue.  Most of the teleplays are by creators Joe Connelly and Bob Mosher.  It have heard that, between them, Connelly and Mosher had a dozen or more relatives, nephews, and nieces the ages of the show's characters.  They were unofficial story editors to Mosher and Connelly on what rang true to life, and what did not, to these kids.When the sublime season one of BEAVER hits DVD on November 22nd, it will be a dream come true for me.  Uncut and non-commercial and remastered--whoa.  Let's also hope they are in correct chronological order so that we can watch the characters grow, and that the minute-long prologues spoken by Hugh Beaumont are included.

I watched this show a few years ago and really loved it. I've been watching it again lately and am looking at it from a more enlightened perspective. I have discovered that this is no mere syndicated television program it is a blueprint for a Utopian society! It must have been beamed down to us by aliens or some other higher being in order to teach us how to have an Utopia.The only problem is it doesn't really tell us how to bring about this Utopia, it just shows it briefly to us. I think it' supposed to show us how a family is supposed to be. The father is always wearing a suit for one thing. If he was wearing a t-shirt and shorts I don't think he'd get nearly the same amount of respect as he does. So it's very important that you wear a suit at all times if you're a father. The mom is always wearing a housedress. I don't think they even make these anymore so all my female readers are going to have a little more work to do, but I'm sure you can find a few or have them made.Next there's Beaver. Since he's the star of the show I think he is supposed to represent all of us. It is important that we learn from his mistakes and not replicate them in our own lives. This show also teaches us how to deal with the Eddie Haskells of the world. No matter who you are you're going to have your share of Eddie Haskells who try to make life difficult for you. Learn from Beaver's mistakes and find out how to and not to deal with them.Most of this show has to do with family life but there's plenty to learn about other things as well such as school, work, and relationships. This show will teach you how to do a good job at your job, how to talk to members of the opposite sex and have succesful marriages with them, and how to get good grades.

The episodes are so funny, and it really is a  pleasant experience to watch a good, wholesome, series.  Even though the DVDs are two-sided, the quality is extremely good.  There is some graininess, but considering the age of this series, the remastering comes out sharp and better than some of the other newer TV series I have purchased on DVD.  39 episodes are included and in my opinion, well worth the price.",4,Memory Lane Revisited - Great Quality DVDs,1262390400,"01 2, 2010",2010,478,"['Leave', 'Beaver', 'Season', '1', 'walk', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'episodes', 'are', 'so', 'funny', 'really', 'pleasant', 'experience', 'watch', 'good', 'wholesome', 'series', 'Even', 'DVDs', 'are', 'two-sided', 'quality', 'extremely', 'good', 'graininess', 'considering', 'age', 'series', 'remastering', 'out', 'sharp', 'better', 'other', 'newer', 'TV', 'series', 'have', 'purchased', 'DVD', '39', 'episodes', 'are', 'included', 'opinion', 'well', 'price']",Leave It To Beaver: The Complete First Season

Anyway, I have been buying all these older shows... but never this old. I was weaned on the age just after this, I'm more or less a Brady Child. As scary as that sounds I'm proud:) I noticed there is not a lot coming out right now, or I have everything I want. I'm about halfway through Rockford, Bewitched Season Two was a given, and as I sit and WAIT for Starsky and Hutch Season 4 I thought I'd throw down the funds for the Beav.I have seen the show don't get me wrong, but if there is one thing I can be reeled in on is any mention of ""pilots with different actors"", I'm just a sucker for this nostalgia-of-what-could-have-been. I watched that first and was delighted, I knew the writing was top notch from my Munsters set I have and was pleased to see this series was on par. I knew from there I'd like it. Mathers is almost eerie, he really was a stand out childhood actor. As I watched the next few episodes I realized Dow was probably there for future eye candy, but despite his general lacking the chemistry between the two just clicks. Hugh and Barbera while a bit erratic in their descision making just complete the package.The dvd package is nothing great but it is fuctional. There are not a bevy of extras but this is from '57 after all. The two sided discs do not bother me as long as they WORK. And while I do like the simple white packaging I'm hoping more imagination can be used in the artwork next time, like was done by Paramount on the Andy Griffith sets, now those are interesting. The picture is somewhat grainy and is nowhere near the great quality of the Andy Griffith Show remaster, but nowhere near as BAD as the public domain junk... so I guess that's somewhere in the middle.I must add this edit: I just watched the episode ""Water, Anyone?"" and could not believe how things have changed! The characters were SO AGHAST at having to PAY for water!! If only they knew what changes were about to come...  *sigh*Another EDIT: My ""Short Pants"" episode had periods of freezing and pixelating which is a shame:(( This episode with Aunt Martha is really one the of the great ones, if the set has any more problems I will be sure to report in here and for sure exchange it... what a hassle, thanks Universal.Don't worry if you are in your mid to late thirties and people are wondering why you aren't watching Lost... you can always tell THEM to get Lost;)",5,I took a chance....,1135555200,"12 26, 2005",2005,2511,"['have', 'cable', 'have', 'antenna', 'TV', 'almost', 'NEVER', 'watch', 'world', 'disaster', 'many', 'would', 'say', 'IS', 'current', 'tv', 'Anyway', 'have', 'been', 'buying', 'older', 'shows', 'never', 'old', 'was', 'weaned', 'age', 'just', ""'m"", 'more', 'less', 'Brady', 'Child', 'As', 'scary', ""'m"", 'proud', 'noticed', 'not', 'lot', 'coming', 'out', 'right', 'now', 'have', 'everything', 'want', ""'m"", 'halfway', 'Rockford', 'Bewitched', 'Season', 'Two', 'was', 'given', 'sit', 'WAIT', 'Starsky', 'Hutch', 'Season', '4', 'thought', ""'d"", 'throw', 'down', 'funds', 'Beav.I', 'have', 'seen', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'one', 'thing', 'can', 'be', 'reeled', 'mention', 'pilots', 'different', 'actors', ""'m"", 'just', 'sucker', 'nostalgia-of-what-could-have-been', 'watched', 'first', 'was', 'delighted', 'knew', 'writing', 'was', 'top', 'notch', 'Munsters', 'set', 'have', 'was', 'pleased', 'see', 'series', 'was', 'par', 'knew', ""'d"", 'like', 'Mathers', 'almost', 'eerie', 'really', 'was', 'stand', 'out', 'childhood', 'actor', 'watched', 'next', 'few', 'episodes', 'realized', 'Dow', 'was', 'probably', 'there', 'future', 'eye', 'candy', 'general', 'lacking', 'chemistry', 'two', 'just', 'clicks', 'Hugh', 'Barbera', 'bit', 'erratic', 'descision', 'making', 'just', 'complete', 'package.The', 'dvd', 'package', 'nothing', 'great', 'fuctional', 'are', 'not', 'bevy', 'extras', ""'57"", 'two', 'sided', 'discs', 'do', 'not', 'bother', 'as', 'long', 'WORK', 'do', 'simple', 'white', 'packaging', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'more', 'imagination', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'artwork', 'next', 'time', 'was', 'done', 'Paramount', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'sets', 'now', 'are', 'interesting', 'picture', 'somewhat', 'grainy', 'nowhere', 'great', 'quality', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'Show', 'remaster', 'nowhere', 'as', 'BAD', 'public', 'domain', 'junk', 'so', 'guess', 'somewhere', 'middle.I', 'must', 'add', 'edit', 'just', 'watched', 'episode', 'Water', 'Anyone', 'could', 'not', 'believe', 'how', 'things', 'have', 'changed', 'characters', 'were', 'SO', 'AGHAST', 'having', 'PAY', 'water', 'only', 'knew', 'what', 'changes', 'were', 'come', 'EDIT', 'Short', 'Pants', 'episode', 'had', 'periods', 'freezing', 'pixelating', 'shame', 'episode', 'Aunt', 'Martha', 'really', 'one', 'great', 'ones', 'set', 'more', 'problems', 'will', 'be', 'sure', 'report', 'here', 'sure', 'exchange', 'what', 'hassle', 'thanks', 'Universal.Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'are', 'mid', 'late', 'thirties', 'people', 'are', 'wondering', 'why', 'are', ""n't"", 'watching', 'Lost', 'can', 'always', 'tell', 'THEM', 'get', 'Lost']",Leave It To Beaver: The Complete First Season
