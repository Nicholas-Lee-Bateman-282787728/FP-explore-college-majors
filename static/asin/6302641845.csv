324470,A2I17T9XB6LSGW,6302641845,Andrew McCaffrey,"[9, 10]","The wonderful Turner Classic Movies recently broadcast DOUGHBOYS during a Buster Keaton marathon in which they had just aired three of Keaton's 20s silent short films.  The difference between this film and those classics was enormous.  Conventional wisdom tells us that Buster Keaton's career plummeted (after peaking in the 1920s) when he signed his MGM contract, thus losing the creative control that he had enjoyed previously.I knew this fact previously, so I went into DOUGHBOYS not expecting much.  It was a comedy war film following Keaton's character from army boot training to combat.  There have been other movies that have taken these elements and made entertaining and funny scenarios out of them, so I assumed that there existed the potential for quality.  I made it a point to take the jokes on their own merits rather than anticipating the heights that I had seen in Keaton's silent films.  Unfortunately, I had to wait quite a long time for the jokes.  Eventually I realized that what I had been viewing as awkward silences were, in fact, the jokes.Oh dear, this was painful.  Buster Keaton never had a chance to save this one, because he has absolutely nothing to work with.  I never felt sorry for a film star the way I felt for Buster Keaton in this stinker.  What was MGM thinking?  They get one of cinema's most original and creative minds and put him in the most clich&eacute;d and unfunny comedies I've seen.I only laughed twice while watching this film.  The first was the sequence where Buster (in drag) manages to infiltrate a stage show and gets involved in an energetic fight/dance routine.  It's Buster playing to his slapstick strengths, so naturally the result is graceful and hilarious.  The second laugh comes from almost the very end, where Buster finds himself behind enemy lines and discovers unexpected conditions.Two funny gags do not a good film make.  To any fan of Buster Keaton, I would recommend just fast forwarding to the dance sequence and forgetting about the rest.

However, if you are a fan, it has a far more independent feel to it than its predecessor, Free and Easy, which was Buster's first talkie. Here Buster plays a wealthy young man who doesn't quite get how the rest of the world works until he manages to accidentally join the Army and is shipped overseas during World War I. Ed Brophy does a great job as an over-loud sergeant who is always on Buster's case, and Cliff Edwards pairs up well with Keaton in a musical number and a skit. This is probably second toSpeak Easilyas being the best of Keaton's MGM talkies, although there is still no comparison to his silent features. Maybe this film is OK because it seems that Buster was allowed to put more of his stamp on it than his other MGM films. For example, the scene where he is entertaining the troops is right out of how he actually entertained soldiers when he was in the Army during World War I. Also, Keaton always said he never quite got the point of WWI since he knew so many nice Germans. Keaton's passivist views comes through in subtle ways throughout the film rather than with the more heavy-handed way Chaplin conveyed the same message.No part of it is actually an embarrassment to watch, and the parts that are belabored are less so than some parts of Keaton's lesser silents. However, Buster never reaches the heights that he does in any of those silents either. The main problem with this and all of Keaton's talking pictures was that early sound pictures were all going for dialogue laughs and that was just not Buster's brand of comedy. However, if you are a Keaton fan there is still much to like about this wartime comedy. Too bad it is not out on DVD.",4,There's plenty to like here if you 're a Buster fan,1207440000,"04 6, 2008",2008,1737,"[""n't"", 'four', 'star', 'film', ""'re"", 'not', 'fan', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'However', 'are', 'fan', 'far', 'more', 'independent', 'feel', 'predecessor', 'Free', 'Easy', 'was', 'Buster', 'first', 'talkie', 'Here', 'Buster', 'wealthy', 'young', 'man', 'who', ""n't"", 'quite', 'get', 'how', 'rest', 'world', 'accidentally', 'join', 'Army', 'shipped', 'overseas', 'World', 'War', 'I.', 'Ed', 'Brophy', 'great', 'job', 'over-loud', 'sergeant', 'who', 'always', 'Buster', 'case', 'Cliff', 'Edwards', 'up', 'well', 'Keaton', 'musical', 'number', 'skit', 'probably', 'second', 'toSpeak', 'Easilyas', 'being', 'best', 'Keaton', 'MGM', 'talkies', 'still', 'comparison', 'silent', 'features', 'Maybe', 'film', 'OK', 'Buster', 'was', 'allowed', 'put', 'more', 'stamp', 'other', 'MGM', 'films', 'example', 'scene', 'where', 'entertaining', 'troops', 'right', 'how', 'actually', 'entertained', 'soldiers', 'when', 'was', 'Army', 'World', 'War', 'Also', 'Keaton', 'always', 'said', 'never', 'quite', 'got', 'point', 'WWI', 'knew', 'so', 'many', 'nice', 'Germans', 'Keaton', 'passivist', 'views', 'subtle', 'ways', 'film', 'rather', 'more', 'heavy-handed', 'way', 'Chaplin', 'conveyed', 'same', 'message.No', 'part', 'actually', 'embarrassment', 'watch', 'parts', 'are', 'belabored', 'are', 'less', 'so', 'parts', 'Keaton', 'lesser', 'silents', 'However', 'Buster', 'never', 'heights', 'silents', 'main', 'problem', 'Keaton', 'talking', 'pictures', 'was', 'early', 'sound', 'pictures', 'were', 'going', 'dialogue', 'laughs', 'was', 'just', 'not', 'Buster', 'brand', 'comedy', 'However', 'are', 'Keaton', 'fan', 'still', 'much', 'like', 'wartime', 'comedy', 'Too', 'bad', 'not', 'out', 'DVD']",N/A
324472,ACPLJ6XRXIZKD,6302641845,Cheated,"[11, 12]","&quot;Doughboys&quot; features Buster as a rich kid who erroneously enlists in the US Army during World War 1.  Supposedly, some of the scenes  are based on his experiences when he actually served in the war.This  film is set in 1917, according to the newspaper headline at the beginning  of the picture that announces that President Wilson is calling for  volunteers. However, if you looked away from the TV for 2 seconds and  didn't see that headline, you would think it was set in 1930, when the film  was made. Obviously, the MGM wardrobe department neglected to dress the  cast and extras according to the style of the 1910's. None of the women are  wearing corsets, long hair, big hats, lace-up shoes, or hemlines below the  knee. None of the men are wearing derbies. All of the fashion you see is  1929-30. Buster is standing alongside his 1930 Rolls Royce in this scene.  It is surprising to see such negligence in a Buster Keaton film because he  had been a stickler for authenticity when he was in charge of the silent  productions he made at his own studio, some with historical settings such  as &quot;Our Hospitality&quot; and &quot;The General&quot;.  However, when  he joined MGM in 1928, he was forced to surrender most of his creative  control.Anyway, two of the best scenes in &quot;Doughboys&quot; are  musical numbers. One is an uncoordinated acrobatic dance that all the film  historians and critics rave about.  Buster is in women's clothing (although  he's got his Army boots on) in a stage revue to entertain the boys. A  better musical scene is a rhythmic ukulele duet with Ukulele  &quot;Ike&quot; Edwards. In their barracks before a roll call on the ship  to France, the two share a ukulele and sing a jazzy number about nothing  (the lyrics go like this: &quot;da dum da doo ba ba dum I want my mama dum  bo dee dum bo&quot;) that ends with Buster either sucking or biting (I  can't tell which) the tuning devices of the ukulele. We are robbed of more  of this wonderful scene when Sargeant Brophy storms in and screams to break  it up. Sargeant Brophy is played by Ed (&quot;you mugs! &quot;) Brophy, who  happens to scream and beat up Buster in most of his MGM films. But this one  takes the cake. I have never seen any actor take on so much scream abuse  than Buster does in &quot;Doughboys&quot;.Buster's battle scenes are  quite clever. He tries to incorporate his silent physical comedy in some of  the scenes, but the producers of the film don't give him more than half a  soundless minute to get his gags across (a good one which reminds me of  Woody Allen is his clumsy attempt to dispose a bomb that's ready to  explode). In the early days of sound, movie-makers were obsessed with  filling all their scenes with lots of talk.",4,Ukulele Buster,962582400,"07 3, 2000",2000,2764,"['quot', 'Doughboys', 'quot', 'features', 'Buster', 'rich', 'kid', 'who', 'erroneously', 'US', 'Army', 'World', 'War', '1', 'Supposedly', 'scenes', 'are', 'based', 'experiences', 'when', 'actually', 'served', 'war.This', 'film', 'set', '1917', 'according', 'newspaper', 'headline', 'beginning', 'picture', 'President', 'Wilson', 'calling', 'volunteers', 'However', 'looked', 'away', 'TV', '2', 'seconds', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'headline', 'would', 'think', 'was', 'set', '1930', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'Obviously', 'MGM', 'wardrobe', 'department', 'neglected', 'dress', 'cast', 'extras', 'according', 'style', '1910', 'None', 'women', 'are', 'wearing', 'corsets', 'long', 'hair', 'big', 'hats', 'lace-up', 'shoes', 'hemlines', 'knee', 'None', 'men', 'are', 'wearing', 'derbies', 'fashion', 'see', '1929-30', 'Buster', 'standing', '1930', 'Rolls', 'Royce', 'scene', 'surprising', 'see', 'such', 'negligence', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'stickler', 'authenticity', 'when', 'was', 'charge', 'silent', 'productions', 'made', 'own', 'studio', 'historical', 'settings', 'such', 'quot', 'Hospitality', 'quot', 'quot', 'General', 'quot', 'However', 'when', 'joined', 'MGM', '1928', 'was', 'forced', 'surrender', 'most', 'creative', 'control.Anyway', 'two', 'best', 'scenes', 'quot', 'Doughboys', 'quot', 'are', 'musical', 'numbers', 'One', 'uncoordinated', 'acrobatic', 'dance', 'film', 'historians', 'critics', 'rave', 'Buster', 'women', 'clothing', 'got', 'Army', 'boots', 'stage', 'revue', 'entertain', 'boys', 'better', 'musical', 'scene', 'rhythmic', 'ukulele', 'duet', 'Ukulele', 'quot', 'Ike', 'quot', 'Edwards', 'barracks', 'roll', 'call', 'ship', 'France', 'two', 'share', 'ukulele', 'sing', 'jazzy', 'number', 'nothing', 'lyrics', 'go', 'quot', 'dum', 'da', 'doo', 'ba', 'dum', 'want', 'mama', 'dum', 'bo', 'dee', 'dum', 'bo', 'quot', 'Buster', 'sucking', 'biting', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'tuning', 'devices', 'ukulele', 'are', 'robbed', 'more', 'wonderful', 'scene', 'when', 'Sargeant', 'Brophy', 'storms', 'screams', 'break', 'up', 'Sargeant', 'Brophy', 'played', 'Ed', 'quot', 'mugs', 'quot', 'Brophy', 'who', 'scream', 'beat', 'up', 'Buster', 'most', 'MGM', 'films', 'one', 'cake', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'actor', 'take', 'so', 'much', 'scream', 'abuse', 'Buster', 'quot', 'Doughboys', 'quot', '.Buster', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'quite', 'clever', 'incorporate', 'silent', 'physical', 'comedy', 'scenes', 'producers', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'more', 'soundless', 'minute', 'get', 'gags', 'good', 'one', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'clumsy', 'attempt', 'dispose', 'bomb', 'ready', 'explode', 'early', 'days', 'sound', 'movie-makers', 'were', 'obsessed', 'filling', 'scenes', 'lots', 'talk']",N/A

They were joke-happy. They didn't look for action; they were looking for funny things to say.""- Buster Keaton about why his career ultimately failedDOUGH BOYS (a/k/a DOUGHBOYS, 1930, dir. Edward Sedgwick) was Buster Keaton's 6th feature film under contract to MGM (he'd do one more for MGM,What! No Beer? [VHS] with Jimmy Durante before being fired) and this was his 2nd talkie.As they wanted him only so they could have another actor in the can, and to use as a punching bag, he is swimming in a cast of funny men and gorgeous dames. Not a bad comedy for all that, but one can plainly see the legendary ""hell of a lot of pratfalls"" Keaton complained about later. To compare this to silent film is not only egregiously stupid - it is also unnecessary.A new world was being born. Even though it would eventually kill Buster, never forget he was the FATHER.As an example of the cast, Ed Brophy plays the shrill, hilarious, bloodthirsty drill sergeant, ""Chief"" Sgt. Brophy. BK plays Elmer, a rich guy who mistakenly enlists in the Army during WWI. They ship off to France and hilarity ensues, with Brophy shrieking at poor BK like he was a teenaged brat. What boggles me about this particular film is the ire and confusion it draws from fans who apparently have never heard BK speak before this.For the life of me, I cannot understand this silly attitude toward Buster's voice. Sure it was a deep, whiskey-sodden Kansas drawl of a voice. It added to his sexiness (oh, yes, he was sexy) and he made it work with the comedy he was doing. In other words, he read his lines and as Spencer Tracy always said, that's all you must do.MGM pioneered the ""screwball"" comedy which was really a variety show with scads of comedians. Buster was relegated by MGM into bit-player status within less than a year after he went under contract with them. They were launching their new talkie stars on the backs and necks of the silent immortals. Buster had been warned by his friends not to go under contract - Oliver Hardy and Charlie Chaplin were the loudest about it. Here, it is too late.Most evil of all are the people who say Buster would do anything for a dollar. If you had lived his life and suffered what he did, you'd have prostituted yourself down the block from wherever you'd be squatting! Be careful whom you insult. This is the man who invented modern film. Don't forget, he even got as far as being THE uncredited gag writer for the Marx Brothers: the ultimate insult.Strictly as film, this comedy is not at all bad. It has very advanced humor that is still fresh and really funny. It has silly moments but they are few and far between. This film in particular gives the Marx Brothers a run for their money. May I beg to remind all critics that were it not for the earlier Buster, this type of comedy film would never have been conceived! So if you can tolerate the disintegrated picture (the sound is flawless) then go for it. It's a nice piece of history.Buster [about his girlfriend]: She kissed me!Fellow comrade-in-arms: So sue her!!However, if you love Buster Joe as I do, be ready for the heartache of a lifetime when you see what he's been reduced to playing.

Halford ""Comedy Fan""","[3, 3]","Service comedies have benefitted many a screen comedian, from Charlie Chaplin to Laurel & Hardy to Bob Hope, and especially Abbott & Costello and Martin & Lewis, who used the concept more than once. MGM probably figured that a WWI army comedy would serve newly-acquired contract player Buster Keaton as well. Does it work? Somewhat. Having comedy director Edward Sedgwick (whom Keaton collaborated with during his peak as a silent comedian) certainly helped things, although we've all seen the same premise: A rich idler dumbly signs up for the army and is forced to cope with military life. Add to that the typical loud-mouthed platoon sargeant who constantly abuses timid Buster, and the dye is cast. At worst, the film's pace is uneven, although this is certainly not Keaton's fault; he manages to project his ""silent character"" nicely during scenes, and his physical comedy gifts are still unparalleled.Producer Hal Roach once said that talking pictures aren't really ""talkies"", but instead, silent films enhanced with dialogue & sound effects. And that's certainly true with ""Doughboys"", as the best moments come when all Keaton had to do to get laughs was ""move"" funny or give a stoic take.Though Keaton's sound career was far from stellar, there's really no Keaton film without merit, simply because he was there. He's always been a fascinating talent to watch, both in silents & talkies.Despite some ""early talkie"" flaws--choppy, awkward editing & noisy static--the film has some dandy comic moments, all owed to Keaton: An engaging ukele music number; Keaton stumbling through training; Keaton cleverly disguising himself as an MP; his resistence against recruiters upon ""accidentally"" joining; the hilarious Apache dancer drag number that shows off Keaton's physical comedy skills beautifully; and driving a truck he thinks is filled with wounded soldiers but contains ammunition, targeted by an enemy plane.""Doughboys"" goes to prove that even ""marginal"" Keaton is better than anything else!",5,The Great Stone Face joins the Army,1350518400,"10 18, 2012",2012,2001,"['Service', 'comedies', 'have', 'benefitted', 'many', 'screen', 'comedian', 'Charlie', 'Chaplin', 'Laurel', 'Hardy', 'Bob', 'Hope', 'especially', 'Abbott', 'Costello', 'Martin', 'Lewis', 'who', 'used', 'concept', 'more', 'once', 'MGM', 'probably', 'figured', 'WWI', 'army', 'comedy', 'would', 'serve', 'newly-acquired', 'contract', 'player', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'well', 'work', 'Somewhat', 'Having', 'comedy', 'director', 'Edward', 'Sedgwick', 'whom', 'Keaton', 'collaborated', 'peak', 'silent', 'comedian', 'certainly', 'helped', 'things', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'same', 'premise', 'rich', 'idler', 'dumbly', 'signs', 'up', 'army', 'forced', 'cope', 'military', 'life', 'Add', 'typical', 'loud-mouthed', 'platoon', 'sargeant', 'who', 'constantly', 'timid', 'Buster', 'dye', 'cast', 'worst', 'film', 'pace', 'uneven', 'certainly', 'not', 'Keaton', 'fault', 'project', 'silent', 'character', 'nicely', 'scenes', 'physical', 'comedy', 'gifts', 'are', 'still', 'unparalleled.Producer', 'Hal', 'Roach', 'once', 'said', 'talking', 'pictures', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'talkies', 'instead', 'silent', 'films', 'enhanced', 'dialogue', 'sound', 'effects', 'certainly', 'true', 'Doughboys', 'best', 'moments', 'come', 'when', 'Keaton', 'had', 'do', 'get', 'laughs', 'was', 'move', 'funny', 'give', 'stoic', 'Keaton', 'sound', 'career', 'was', 'far', 'stellar', 'really', 'Keaton', 'film', 'merit', 'simply', 'was', 'there', 'always', 'been', 'fascinating', 'talent', 'watch', 'silents', 'talkies.Despite', 'early', 'talkie', 'flaws', 'choppy', 'awkward', 'editing', 'noisy', 'static', 'film', 'dandy', 'comic', 'moments', 'owed', 'Keaton', 'engaging', 'ukele', 'music', 'number', 'Keaton', 'stumbling', 'training', 'Keaton', 'cleverly', 'disguising', 'MP', 'resistence', 'recruiters', 'accidentally', 'joining', 'hilarious', 'Apache', 'dancer', 'drag', 'number', 'Keaton', 'physical', 'comedy', 'skills', 'beautifully', 'driving', 'truck', 'filled', 'wounded', 'soldiers', 'ammunition', 'targeted', 'enemy', 'plane', 'Doughboys', 'prove', 'even', 'marginal', 'Keaton', 'better', 'anything', 'else']",N/A

to help him in his story,but all they managed to do was insert the usual run of the mill verbal jokes,and Buster is reduced to pratfalling,to get any kind of laughs.Unfortunately even his falls no longer have the appeal they once did,as they seemed forced.The story has Buster as a character similar in nature to his role in The Navigator.He is rich and spoiled and keeps coming down to the exit of a company everyday to ask a girl out.WW1 breaks out and one day there are recruiters around trying to sign up men to go over there.Buster's driver enlists leaving he and his German butler stranded.Wanting to immediately hire another driver he walks into what he thinks is an employment agency.When all is said and done Keaton is drafted.There are the usual gags and misdirection during training camp,with Ed Brophy as the sergeant whom Keaton gets on the wrong side of.Over there Keaton runs into the girl who is now an ambulance driver.Before Keaton goes to the front he gets into plenty of trouble while being billeted with his platoon.At the front he eventually manages to first capture his own platoon mate.Then he meets his old butler who asks for his old job back.He promises to bring back food for his old friend and other Germans there.Keaton returns to his lines and brings back a German map for which he is praised and sent to the rear for R&R.Then; the war ends.The film ends as Keaton is now back home as a civilian running his business with alot of his old ex army pals as sidemen.The last &#34;gag&#34; is a rivet hammer sending the group ducking for cover.That last gag is so terrible and predictable,but it is typical of what one sees throughout.The pace is so slow which swiftly takes away the punch of any attempt at humour.Cliff Edwards does get some cracks at his great singing.And there is one shining moment where Edwards,Keaton and director Ed Sedgewick sit down and have a little jam in their billet.Technically speaking the film is in its original a/r and is clear and crisp.But it has the usual defects associated with films of this age.All in all not one of Keaton's better MGM films.While not bad,it is far from good.Keaton always complained of his so called MGM &#34;writers&#34; trying to insert bits of funny business constantly in his pictures.If only they had left him alone,this might have been a much better film.2 1/2-3 stars.",3,A poor Keaton entry-2 1/2-3 stars.,1390867200,"01 28, 2014",2014,2592,"['Doughboys', 'released', 'Aug/30', 'stars', 'others', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'Sally', 'Ellers', 'Cliff', 'Edwards', 'Edward', 'Brophy.This', 'tepid', 'comedy', 'starring', 'Buster', 'role', 'back', 'own', 'days', 'serving', 'WW1.MGM', 'had', '34', 'writers', '34', 'help', 'story', 'managed', 'do', 'was', 'insert', 'usual', 'run', 'mill', 'verbal', 'jokes', 'Buster', 'reduced', 'pratfalling', 'get', 'kind', 'laughs.Unfortunately', 'even', 'no', 'longer', 'have', 'appeal', 'once', 'did', 'seemed', 'forced.The', 'story', 'Buster', 'character', 'similar', 'nature', 'role', 'Navigator.He', 'rich', 'spoiled', 'coming', 'down', 'exit', 'company', 'everyday', 'ask', 'girl', 'out.WW1', 'out', 'one', 'day', 'are', 'recruiters', 'trying', 'sign', 'up', 'men', 'go', 'over', 'there.Buster', 'driver', 'leaving', 'German', 'butler', 'stranded.Wanting', 'immediately', 'hire', 'driver', 'what', 'employment', 'agency.When', 'said', 'done', 'Keaton', 'are', 'usual', 'gags', 'misdirection', 'training', 'camp', 'Ed', 'Brophy', 'sergeant', 'whom', 'Keaton', 'wrong', 'side', 'Keaton', 'girl', 'who', 'now', 'ambulance', 'driver.Before', 'Keaton', 'front', 'plenty', 'trouble', 'being', 'billeted', 'platoon.At', 'front', 'eventually', 'first', 'capture', 'own', 'platoon', 'mate.Then', 'old', 'butler', 'who', 'old', 'job', 'back.He', 'promises', 'bring', 'back', 'food', 'old', 'friend', 'other', 'Germans', 'there.Keaton', 'returns', 'lines', 'back', 'German', 'map', 'praised', 'sent', 'rear', 'R', 'R.Then', 'war', 'ends.The', 'film', 'Keaton', 'now', 'back', 'home', 'civilian', 'running', 'business', 'alot', 'old', 'ex', 'army', 'pals', 'sidemen.The', 'last', '34', 'gag', '34', 'rivet', 'hammer', 'sending', 'group', 'ducking', 'last', 'gag', 'so', 'terrible', 'predictable', 'typical', 'what', 'one', 'throughout.The', 'pace', 'so', 'slow', 'swiftly', 'away', 'punch', 'attempt', 'humour.Cliff', 'Edwards', 'get', 'cracks', 'great', 'singing.And', 'one', 'shining', 'moment', 'where', 'Edwards', 'Keaton', 'director', 'Ed', 'Sedgewick', 'sit', 'down', 'have', 'little', 'jam', 'billet.Technically', 'speaking', 'film', 'original', 'a/r', 'clear', 'crisp.But', 'usual', 'defects', 'associated', 'films', 'age.All', 'not', 'one', 'Keaton', 'better', 'MGM', 'films.While', 'not', 'bad', 'far', 'good.Keaton', 'always', 'complained', 'so', 'called', 'MGM', '34', 'writers', '34', 'trying', 'insert', 'bits', 'funny', 'business', 'constantly', 'pictures.If', 'only', 'had', 'left', 'alone', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'film.2', '1/2-3', 'stars']",N/A

Unlike the majority of his MGM talkies, the studio allowed Keaton more creative input for this military comedy. Directed by Edward  Sedgwick, ""Doughboys"" has some classic moments -  Buster's performance in drag and his scat-singing with Cliff ""Ukulele  Ike"" Edwards - that make up for the dead spots. Though Keaton was fond of ""Doughboys,"" it's a far cry from ""The General"" and ""Seven Chances.""",3,Some Classic Keaton Moments,933552000,"08 2, 1999",1999,470,"['Doughboys', '1930', 'was', 'inspired', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'World', 'War', 'experiences', 'majority', 'MGM', 'talkies', 'studio', 'allowed', 'Keaton', 'more', 'creative', 'input', 'military', 'comedy', 'Directed', 'Edward', 'Sedgwick', 'Doughboys', 'classic', 'moments', 'Buster', 'performance', 'drag', 'scat-singing', 'Cliff', 'Ukulele', 'Ike', 'Edwards', 'make', 'up', 'dead', 'spots', 'Keaton', 'was', 'fond', 'Doughboys', 'far', 'cry', 'General', 'Seven', 'Chances']",N/A
