He was that really weird stepfather in the first documentary, the one who acted really suspicious.Well here's another documentary dedicated to his weirdness.  This sequel has really nothing else to offer the viewer other than that, along with some more disturbing crime photos.  Yeah, it does provide some updates.  For instance, there was the question of whether or not a mark found on one of the boys was a bite mark and, if it was that, why doesn't it match any of the three ""killers.""  That's about all this film offers, other than speculation on Byers' possible guilt.I felt that the first documentary sufficed.  It was enough to get people talking about the case.  This one was just exploitative.  If you're really interested in the updates, you'd be better off doing some research on the internet yourself.  You might even get a more balanced view.  This film was just embarassing to watch.  You know, it was like, ""Been there, done that.

A group of media savvy LA scenesters have taken up the case of the three convicted teens, and this movie tells their story as they try to link the step-father of one of the victims to the 1993 crime. Informed viewers still don't get enough meat here to make a judgment either way, but the film, despite pretensions to neutrality, certainly makes its viewpoint clear: the crazy guy did it, not the teens. But Damien, the oldest teen, is his own worst enemy in raising suspicions.

665992,AW3VZ5O895LRK,B00005MKOT,"carol irvin ""carol irvin""","[0, 0]","The star of this piece is Mark Byers, the stepfather of one of the murdered boys.  The 1st documentary left us with the question of whether he could have been the murderer instead of the 3 young men who were convicted. This sequel is dominated by that idea and Byers is a clearly psychotic man, under the influence of at least 5 psychotropic prescriptions, who was more than willing to perform for a fee paid by the filmmakers.  Frankly, without Byers, I don't think a full length documentary about why the 3 young men are still in prison, would have captured as much interest.  Is there reasonable doubt about the guilt of those men?  Oh, yes, and that was present in film #1.  In fact, the West Memphis, Arkansas police force's methodology for handling forensic evidence rivals the LAPD's handling of the same in the OJ Simpson case. Incompetency seems to be a job qualification in West Memphis both for the police department and the judiciary.  However, I am troubled by the filmmakers paying Mark Byers to perform for them. He does give us a villainous performance that is chilling and eerie.  He reminds me of Robert Mitchum's character in the ""The Hunter,"" as the evangelical minister tracking two children.  It is possible that Byers is the killer.  It may even be probable.  However, because of the incompetence used with the forensic evidence, any murder case will probably remain incapable of being proved beyond a reasonable doubt against Byers or anyone else.  I think the first documentary was a great deal more objective and didn't rely on using Byers as the lead actor or character of the piece.  I was convinced that a gross injustice had been done the 3 young men and this film merely shows that still, at this late date, that injustice continues.",4,"Engrossing, Disturbing & Not As Objective As 1st Film",1012780800,"02 4, 2002",2002,1764,"['star', 'piece', 'Mark', 'Byers', 'stepfather', 'one', 'murdered', 'boys', '1st', 'documentary', 'left', 'question', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'murderer', 'instead', '3', 'young', 'men', 'who', 'were', 'convicted', 'sequel', 'dominated', 'idea', 'Byers', 'clearly', 'psychotic', 'man', 'influence', 'least', '5', 'psychotropic', 'prescriptions', 'who', 'was', 'more', 'willing', 'perform', 'fee', 'paid', 'filmmakers', 'Frankly', 'Byers', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'full', 'length', 'documentary', 'why', '3', 'young', 'men', 'are', 'still', 'prison', 'would', 'have', 'captured', 'much', 'interest', 'there', 'reasonable', 'doubt', 'guilt', 'men', 'Oh', 'yes', 'was', 'present', 'film', '1', 'fact', 'West', 'Memphis', 'Arkansas', 'police', 'force', 'methodology', 'handling', 'forensic', 'evidence', 'rivals', 'LAPD', 'handling', 'same', 'OJ', 'Simpson', 'case', 'Incompetency', 'be', 'job', 'qualification', 'West', 'Memphis', 'police', 'department', 'judiciary', 'However', 'am', 'troubled', 'filmmakers', 'paying', 'Mark', 'Byers', 'perform', 'give', 'villainous', 'performance', 'chilling', 'eerie', 'Robert', 'Mitchum', 'character', 'Hunter', 'evangelical', 'minister', 'tracking', 'two', 'children', 'possible', 'Byers', 'killer', 'may', 'even', 'be', 'probable', 'However', 'incompetence', 'used', 'forensic', 'evidence', 'murder', 'case', 'will', 'probably', 'remain', 'incapable', 'being', 'proved', 'reasonable', 'doubt', 'Byers', 'anyone', 'else', 'think', 'first', 'documentary', 'was', 'great', 'deal', 'more', 'objective', 'did', ""n't"", 'rely', 'using', 'Byers', 'lead', 'actor', 'character', 'piece', 'was', 'convinced', 'gross', 'injustice', 'had', 'been', 'done', '3', 'young', 'men', 'film', 'merely', 'still', 'late', 'date', 'injustice']",N/A

Logic and reason have been discarded in favor of attempting to paint the stepfather of one of the murdered boys as being the real killer. There is all sorts  of grandstanding by likes of the unrepentant killers and their ignorant supporters.A disturbing aspect of this documentary is the fact short shrift was given to 2 of the convicted murderers, Jason Baldwin and Jessie Misskelly both of whom are plain looking. However, a huge amount of attention was paid to convicted murderer Damien Echols. This was done because Echols is quite handsome.This movie is also a witch hunt. Specifically, it attempts to make the case that the real killer is one John Mark Byers who was the stepfather of one of the murdered boys. There is no attempt at balance here. All sorts of aspersions are cast on Byers without ever attempting to talk to Byers' dentist, doctors or the police officer who cleared Byers of suspicion via polygraph test. The producers of this documentary claim that Byers' wife died under mysterious circumstances. The claim was made that the dead children had bite marks all over them without disclosing that well before the documentary was made, the assertion about bite marks was thororughly discredited. Additionally, the documentary claims that Byers had all of his teeth removed without proof of it. The reality was that Byers had a disease that caused most of his teeth to fall out, but the documentary left that fact out to make Byers look as guilty as possible.At the beginning of Paradise Lost 2 - Revelations, it was stated that most of the relatives of the 3 victims (who are the real West Memphis 3) did not want to be involved in the making of this production. Given the facts that the first Paradise Lost was horribly slanted in favor of the convicted murderers and also that this sequel was a witch hunt directed at Byers, it appears that the families of the victims showed very good judgment.",1,Propaganda and a Witch Hunt to Boot,1175558400,"04 3, 2007",2007,2027,"['Paradise', 'Lost', '2', 'Revelations', 'poor', 'excuse', 'documentary', 'never', 'level', 'tabloid', 'Logic', 'reason', 'have', 'been', 'discarded', 'favor', 'attempting', 'paint', 'stepfather', 'one', 'murdered', 'boys', 'being', 'real', 'killer', 'sorts', 'grandstanding', 'likes', 'unrepentant', 'killers', 'ignorant', 'supporters.A', 'disturbing', 'aspect', 'documentary', 'fact', 'short', 'shrift', 'was', 'given', '2', 'convicted', 'murderers', 'Jason', 'Baldwin', 'Jessie', 'Misskelly', 'whom', 'are', 'plain', 'looking', 'However', 'huge', 'amount', 'attention', 'was', 'paid', 'convicted', 'murderer', 'Damien', 'Echols', 'was', 'done', 'because', 'Echols', 'quite', 'handsome.This', 'movie', 'also', 'witch', 'hunt', 'Specifically', 'make', 'case', 'real', 'killer', 'one', 'John', 'Mark', 'Byers', 'who', 'was', 'stepfather', 'one', 'murdered', 'boys', 'attempt', 'balance', 'here', 'sorts', 'aspersions', 'are', 'cast', 'Byers', 'ever', 'attempting', 'talk', 'Byers', 'dentist', 'doctors', 'police', 'officer', 'who', 'cleared', 'Byers', 'suspicion', 'polygraph', 'test', 'producers', 'documentary', 'claim', 'Byers', 'wife', 'died', 'mysterious', 'circumstances', 'claim', 'was', 'made', 'dead', 'children', 'had', 'bite', 'marks', 'disclosing', 'well', 'documentary', 'was', 'made', 'assertion', 'bite', 'marks', 'was', 'thororughly', 'discredited', 'Additionally', 'documentary', 'claims', 'Byers', 'had', 'teeth', 'removed', 'proof', 'reality', 'was', 'Byers', 'had', 'disease', 'caused', 'most', 'teeth', 'fall', 'out', 'documentary', 'left', 'fact', 'make', 'Byers', 'look', 'as', 'guilty', 'possible.At', 'beginning', 'Paradise', 'Lost', '2', 'Revelations', 'was', 'stated', 'most', 'relatives', '3', 'victims', 'who', 'are', 'real', 'West', 'Memphis', '3', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'be', 'involved', 'making', 'production', 'Given', 'facts', 'first', 'Paradise', 'Lost', 'was', 'horribly', 'slanted', 'favor', 'convicted', 'murderers', 'also', 'sequel', 'was', 'witch', 'hunt', 'directed', 'Byers', 'families', 'victims', 'showed', 'very', 'good', 'judgment']",N/A

Less familiar would be the genre the ""Paradise Lost"" films fall into - more than mere ""documentaries,"" I myself would categorize them as ""legal horror.""Because, truly, there are few things more horrifying in a country that values liberty and freedom than the notion of miscarried justice, which manifests to the extreme when the guilt of those awaiting the death penalty is brought into question.And to say that ""Paradise Lost 2: Revelations"" is a gut-wrenchingly powerful documentary - sorry: ""legal horror film"" - is to understate its impact; truth be told, as this movie unfolded and each new ""revelation"" was revealed, I actually had to pause my DVD player on more than one occasion - the effect was so visceral, I had to stop and collect myself before I was ready to proceed.PL2 revisits the case of the ""West Memphis Three,"" 3 young men who were accused, convicted and now serving time (one on death row) for the murders of 3 children in the early 90's.  Like the first film, we are shown many disturbing details about the case, some of which cast a lengthy shadow of doubt upon the verdict (so much so that a lot of this sequel chronicles the activities of an advocacy group that was formed as a result of the first film).And while I don't want to get too far into how I personally feel about the case, I will say that some of Mark Byers' (father of one of the slain children) claims seem rather toothless.  Well, that and the fact that Byers' violent piety (my least favorite kind of piety) has all the believability and sincerity of a late-night infomercial.  I'm really not sure if the man is so disturbing simply because of his speech and mannerisms or the fact that he appears to be a better suspect in the case than those who were actually convicted.Regardless, this film is highly recommended for anyone who cares about justice in the world today - I would say if you enjoy the legal thriller genre, then you will also be very interested in this ""true crime"" account.  But be warned: this movie is also disturbing on many levels, not the least of which are the graphic crime scene photos.  Also, this is the kind of film that will stay with you - so if you're looking for a ""popcorn movie"" whose impression fades before the credits do, stay away from this one.In fact, this movie had such an effect on me that I was immediately inspired to do some follow-up research on the internet to get updates on where the case(s) now stood.And though I'd like to give this DVD 5 stars (and the movie itself deserves such a rating), I can only give it 4, as the ""extras"" are paltry and lame and I really would have enjoyed hearing a directors' commentary on this - especially since filmmakers Bruce Sinofsky and Joe Berlinger have such a winning and insightful commentary on the DVD of the film they did after this one, Metallica's ""Some Kind of Monster.""But like I said, the movie itself is so powerful that you'll likely be inspired to find extras of your own even though the DVD doesn't provide them.",4,Jaw-dropping.

Haunting, gripping, and downright Creepy, this movie is for anyone who is interested in the justice system, true crime, forensics, or people in general.GREAT FILM.",5,A Creepy look at a travesty of justice...,1332979200,"03 29, 2012",2012,1013,"['saw', 'Paradise', 'Lost', 'immediately', 'started', 'looking', 'more', 'information', 'Damien', 'Jessie', 'Jason', 'a.k.a', 'West', 'Memphis', 'Three', 'found', 'movie', 'Paradise', 'Lost', '2', 'Revelations', 'local', 'library', 'watched', 'movie', 'just', 'as', 'riveting', 'first', 'one', 'am', 'floored', 'complete', 'lack', 'justice', 'three', 'young', 'boys', 'who', 'were', 'brutally', 'murdered', 'Why', 'look', 'real', 'killers', 'when', 'can', 'rush', 'judgement', 'three', 'outsiders', 'who', 'look', 'different', 'listen', 'heavy', 'metal', 'must', 'be', 'satan', 'worshippers', 'therefore', 'are', 'guilty', 'crime', 'Let', 'string', 'up', 'film', 'more', 'information', 'few', 'years', 'first', 'one', 'have', 'really', 'liked', 'films', 'tell', 'sad', 'tale', 'three', 'murdered', 'boys', 'who', 'will', 'never', 'have', 'justice', 'three', 'other', 'young', 'boys', 'who', 'were', 'locked', 'up', 'crime', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'Haunting', 'gripping', 'downright', 'Creepy', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'interested', 'justice', 'system', 'true', 'crime', 'forensics', 'people', 'general.GREAT', 'FILM']",N/A
665999,A2TT4AA3QO0DPY,B00005MKOT,Jay Young,"[8, 9]","After watching the first film, there were some questions regarding the trial I had that I was hoping the sequel would answer. It didn't. If anything, the sequel just created more questions. I will list them:1.) Alibis- In the first film, all 3 defendants claimed to have alibis for the night of the murder, but we learned very little about them. I thought to myself, ""why didn't the defense play this card in court?"" The testimony of the alibis themselves should have been enough to exonerate the defendants. I was hoping that ""Paradise Lost 2"" would address the issue, but it didn't. So I looked into the matter, and found out that Damien and Jessie's lawyers tried, but the alibis fell apart in court. Damian tried to claim that he was visiting a relative for the night of the murder, but under cross-examination, it turned out to be a different night. Jessie's alibi tried to say that he was at a wrestling tournament that night, but the receipt for the tournament was for a different night. Jason didn't even try. All of this makes an impact on how one views the case, doesn't it? Now lack of alibis does not in itself establish guilt, but the filmmakers' failure to include this part of the trial in the first movie or to discuss the issue in the second, casts doubt on the ""miscarriage of justice"" angle.2.) Damien Echols- I didn't think that the previous film was complete in exploring Damien's psychological history. For instance, is there any evidence of psychological disorders or sociopathic tendencies. These are the kinds of questions that need to be explored in a documentary about someone accused of murder, and I was hoping the sequel would address the issue. It didn't, and in fact further confused it. For example, in one scene Damian is on a conference call with his mother and supporters, via collect. Towards the end of the call, his mother was getting emotional and started crying. Damien said several times, ""stop crying."" And the tone of voice did not indicate, ""stop crying, because everything's going to be OK"" but ""stop crying, because you embarrass me."" Now this to me seems a callous way to treat one's mother. That does not necessarily indicate a psychological disorder, but does it not at the least raise a red flag? Furthermore, Damien expresses certitude that Mark Byers is the killer. He says ""he doesn't deserve my contempt"" and ""he killed three kids."" Really? Why is he so certain of this?3.) Mark Byers- And this brings me to the third problem I have with the  sequel; it makes a completely unnecessary focus on Mark Byers. Despite a total lack of evidence linking him to the crime, the fact that he passed a polygraph test, and his express willingness to cooperate with any police (not filmmaker) investigation, many of the WM3 (West Memphis 3) supporters in the film believe, or at least suspect, that Byers committed the crimes. Why?Further, according to the WM3 website, a strand of hair was found on victim Johnnie Branch's shoe- it belonged to his stepfather, Terry Hobbs.  Hobbs was then brought in for questioning, and we read on the website: ""Our new filing also includes strong evidence from Pam Hobbs (the ex-wife of Terry Hobbs and the mother of one of the victims) implicating her former husband in the murders."" So the WM3 supporters claim that the 3 accused were wrongly convicted, yet they will willingly implicate other people on the flimsiest evidence (a knife found with Mark Byers' blood on it, a strand of hair of Terry Hobbs, and the claims of Hobbs' ex-wife).We need a new, objective documentary on the Robin Hood Hills murder. One that will examine both the evidence (or lack thereof) tying the accused to the murders, and the cottage industry and cult of personality that has also unfortunately arisen around the accused.",3,Too many unanswered questions,1198281600,"12 22, 2007",2007,3783,"['watching', 'first', 'film', 'were', 'questions', 'regarding', 'trial', 'had', 'was', 'hoping', 'sequel', 'would', 'answer', 'did', ""n't"", 'anything', 'sequel', 'just', 'created', 'more', 'questions', 'will', 'list', 'them:1', 'Alibis-', 'first', 'film', '3', 'defendants', 'claimed', 'have', 'alibis', 'night', 'murder', 'learned', 'very', 'little', 'thought', 'myself', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'defense', 'play', 'card', 'court', 'testimony', 'alibis', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'enough', 'exonerate', 'defendants', 'was', 'hoping', 'Paradise', 'Lost', '2', 'would', 'address', 'issue', 'did', ""n't"", 'So', 'looked', 'matter', 'found', 'out', 'Damien', 'Jessie', 'lawyers', 'tried', 'alibis', 'fell', 'apart', 'court', 'Damian', 'tried', 'claim', 'was', 'visiting', 'relative', 'night', 'murder', 'cross-examination', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'different', 'night', 'Jessie', 'alibi', 'tried', 'say', 'was', 'wrestling', 'tournament', 'night', 'receipt', 'tournament', 'was', 'different', 'night', 'Jason', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'try', 'impact', 'how', 'one', 'case', ""n't"", 'Now', 'lack', 'alibis', 'not', 'establish', 'guilt', 'filmmakers', 'failure', 'include', 'part', 'trial', 'first', 'movie', 'discuss', 'issue', 'second', 'doubt', 'miscarriage', 'justice', 'angle.2', 'Echols-', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'previous', 'film', 'was', 'complete', 'exploring', 'Damien', 'psychological', 'history', 'instance', 'there', 'evidence', 'psychological', 'disorders', 'sociopathic', 'tendencies', 'are', 'kinds', 'questions', 'need', 'be', 'explored', 'documentary', 'someone', 'accused', 'murder', 'was', 'hoping', 'sequel', 'would', 'address', 'issue', 'did', ""n't"", 'fact', 'further', 'confused', 'example', 'one', 'scene', 'Damian', 'conference', 'call', 'mother', 'supporters', 'collect', 'end', 'call', 'mother', 'was', 'getting', 'emotional', 'started', 'crying', 'Damien', 'said', 'several', 'times', 'stop', 'crying', 'tone', 'voice', 'did', 'not', 'indicate', 'stop', 'crying', 'everything', 'going', 'be', 'OK', 'stop', 'crying', 'embarrass', 'Now', 'callous', 'way', 'treat', 'one', 'mother', 'not', 'necessarily', 'indicate', 'psychological', 'disorder', 'not', 'least', 'raise', 'red', 'flag', 'Furthermore', 'Damien', 'certitude', 'Mark', 'Byers', 'killer', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'contempt', 'killed', 'three', 'kids', 'Really', 'Why', 'so', 'certain', '3', 'Mark', 'Byers-', 'third', 'problem', 'have', 'sequel', 'completely', 'unnecessary', 'focus', 'Mark', 'Byers', 'total', 'lack', 'evidence', 'linking', 'crime', 'fact', 'passed', 'polygraph', 'test', 'express', 'willingness', 'cooperate', 'police', 'not', 'filmmaker', 'investigation', 'many', 'WM3', 'West', 'Memphis', '3', 'supporters', 'film', 'believe', 'least', 'suspect', 'Byers', 'committed', 'crimes', 'Why', 'Further', 'according', 'WM3', 'website', 'strand', 'hair', 'was', 'found', 'victim', 'Johnnie', 'Branch', 'shoe-', 'belonged', 'stepfather', 'Terry', 'Hobbs', 'Hobbs', 'was', 'then', 'brought', 'questioning', 'read', 'website', 'new', 'filing', 'also', 'strong', 'evidence', 'Pam', 'Hobbs', 'ex-wife', 'Terry', 'Hobbs', 'mother', 'one', 'victims', 'implicating', 'former', 'husband', 'murders', 'WM3', 'supporters', 'claim', '3', 'accused', 'were', 'wrongly', 'convicted', 'yet', 'will', 'willingly', 'implicate', 'other', 'people', 'flimsiest', 'evidence', 'knife', 'found', 'Mark', 'Byers', 'blood', 'strand', 'hair', 'Terry', 'Hobbs', 'claims', 'Hobbs', 'ex-wife', '.We', 'need', 'new', 'objective', 'documentary', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'Hills', 'murder', 'One', 'will', 'examine', 'evidence', 'lack', 'thereof', 'tying', 'accused', 'murders', 'cottage', 'industry', 'cult', 'personality', 'also', 'unfortunately', 'arisen', 'accused']",N/A

I asked a friend of mine what he thought of this while WM3 situation, he shrugged his shoulders and said ""They eat there young down there"".  His attitude seems to reflect that of many people, that the subjects of this film (Including the murdered boys) were subhuman and it didn't matter what happened to them.  This attitude seems to be reflected in the actions of the so-called authorities who mismanaged this case from the get go.  Anyone with eyes can see the confession was laughable, that in any other state, almost, it would never have been admissible, but the individuals, I think, simply pinned the murder on these three simple minded boys, then railroaded them based on peoples ignorance and fear.  They cared less then not at all for the people they convicted and for the victims even less, they just wanted somebody, anybody to pin this on and they went with it.  When compelling evidence is found afterward to prove they are not guilty, they just ignore it so they don't look bad.  All that matters is that they are right, not the murdered children or the WM3, who cares about a bunch of inbred, illiterate morons with bad teeth?  They live in trailer courts and they talk funny, so what?  It is frustrating to watch and even more so as time goes on.  It's one thing to show a travesty taking place, it is another to have everyone else see it and then pretend it's not there?

Gordon,"[2, 2]","Generally riveting follow up of the case where three quite possiblyinnocent young men sit in prison for murdering three children.Certainly, at least given what the two documentaries show, there is waybeyond 'reasonable doubt' that they're responsible. But what was amoderate flaw in the first film becomes worse here; In the same way theprosecution disturbingly made the evidence fit their theory, throwingout, ignoring, or belittling what didn't fit, the film-makers seem toplay some of the same game in reverse.Crucial questions about alibis are never answered, and this sequelspends too much energy trying to pin guilt on Mark Byers, step-fatherof one of the murdered boys.Is there some spooky circumstantial evidence that he may have beeninvolved? Absolutely. But proof? The man even voluntarily takes a liedetector test, and passes with flying colors, which the film- makersthen dismiss since the man is on various prescription mood alteringdrugs. But do we ever hear an expert say those drugs might affectthe test? No.More disturbing, the film seems to imply he's guilty because he looksand acts weird, and says confusing and contradictory things, the verysort of 'guilt by odd behavior' association both films attack inrelation to the three boys found guilty. The fact that Byers(supposedly) has a brain tumor, and what effect that might have on hisoutward behavior is never explored at all. And watching this characterat such length starts to get dull after a while, as his rants go on andon.None-the-less, this is still a very interesting film, the most movingsections being those spent with the three now young men in jail for acrime they likely didn't commit. All have grown up a great deal in the4 years since the last film, and are sad and articulate reminders ofhow horrifying it can be that people never given the benefit of a fairtrial are allowed to sit and rot in prison.

These films investigate the aftermath a a horrific triple child murder and the conviction of three young men who continue to maintain their innocence.PL2 picks up where the first film left off. We meet the three convicted young men--Damien Echols, Jason Baldwin, and Jessie Misskelley, all older and still imprisoned. Damien, the only one of the three to receive the death penalty, is appealing his conviction, and his life-and-death situation gives PL2 a particular power and urgency.There is extensive interview footage with many of the individuals involved in the case: the original judge, Jessie's defense attorney, and more. Especially poignant is the footage with the family members of the convicted. But as in the first film, the most indelible character is undoubtedly the controversial John Mark Byers, the angry stepfather of one of the murder victims. One issue PL2 explores is the question whether Byers was actually involved in the actual murders.Also fascinating is the footage featuring members of the support group of people who believe that Echols, Baldwin, and Misskelley were all unfairly convicted. The young men have become known as the ""West Memphis Three"" to their supporters, and PL2 tells about the origins of the WM3 Web site.I will warn potential viewers that this film contains graphic photographs of the murdered children, one of whom was sexually mutilated.

Though not as high profile as some have been, when a case like this brings out such emotion it is important to see what the players are doing through the years from the criminals to the victim's families.There has been enough hype that has promoted this into popular thought.  Internet groups have been sprung up to promote the innocence and hearsay that the three teenagers accused of murdering three boys in a demonic ritual were falsely accused.  The teenagers are currently serving life sentences without parole.  We see them in a different light than before.  They are older, more mature, and hardened by prison.  They are more accepting of their situation, saying that they wish they had not done or said the things they had said because they didn't understand before.  Granted, but that is not enough to release them from their guilt.We are supposed to cast doubt on their guilt by further investigation of the victim's stepfather.  They are all poor white trash in Arkansas, he is no exception.  He's had several brushes with the law, and his wife (the mother of one of the victims) died under mysterious circumstances in 96.  He also had his teeth removed and wears dentures (which he takes out and displays many times in this documentary), casting doubt upon whether or not the bite marks on the victims could match his teeth.  He is flamboyant and loves the spotlight, but the other victims' families choose to bow out, wanting to be left in peace with their grief.  This is not enough evidence to convince me that he might have done it.The fact remains that these teenage boys, now young adult men, will get the electric chair someday because they deserve it.  There is too much evidence that they did it.  Check the special features section in this and the first documentary to see the things that ended up on the cutting room floor.  They didn't give you an accurate picture of them as teenagers, nor as young adults.  There are several red herrings in evidence, the police did not do the best job they could have done (do they ever in these cases?), and too much has come forward from others to determine their guilt rather than defend their innocence.",5,Excellent follow up,1216252800,"07 17, 2008",2008,2240,"['High', 'profile', 'murder', 'cases', 'deserve', 'follow', 'up', 'was', 'exception', 'Though', 'not', 'as', 'high', 'profile', 'have', 'been', 'when', 'case', 'out', 'such', 'emotion', 'important', 'see', 'what', 'players', 'are', 'doing', 'years', 'criminals', 'victim', 'families.There', 'been', 'enough', 'hype', 'promoted', 'popular', 'thought', 'Internet', 'groups', 'have', 'been', 'sprung', 'up', 'promote', 'innocence', 'hearsay', 'three', 'teenagers', 'accused', 'murdering', 'three', 'boys', 'demonic', 'ritual', 'were', 'falsely', 'accused', 'teenagers', 'are', 'currently', 'serving', 'life', 'sentences', 'parole', 'see', 'different', 'light', 'before', 'are', 'older', 'more', 'mature', 'hardened', 'prison', 'are', 'more', 'accepting', 'situation', 'saying', 'wish', 'had', 'not', 'done', 'said', 'things', 'had', 'said', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'Granted', 'not', 'enough', 'release', 'guilt.We', 'are', 'supposed', 'cast', 'doubt', 'guilt', 'further', 'investigation', 'victim', 'stepfather', 'are', 'poor', 'white', 'trash', 'Arkansas', 'exception', 'had', 'several', 'brushes', 'law', 'wife', 'mother', 'one', 'victims', 'died', 'mysterious', 'circumstances', '96', 'also', 'had', 'teeth', 'removed', 'wears', 'dentures', 'out', 'displays', 'many', 'times', 'documentary', 'casting', 'doubt', 'not', 'bite', 'marks', 'victims', 'could', 'match', 'teeth', 'flamboyant', 'spotlight', 'other', 'victims', 'families', 'choose', 'bow', 'out', 'wanting', 'be', 'left', 'peace', 'grief', 'not', 'enough', 'evidence', 'convince', 'might', 'have', 'done', 'it.The', 'fact', 'teenage', 'boys', 'now', 'young', 'adult', 'men', 'will', 'get', 'electric', 'chair', 'someday', 'deserve', 'too', 'much', 'evidence', 'did', 'Check', 'special', 'features', 'section', 'first', 'documentary', 'see', 'things', 'ended', 'up', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'accurate', 'picture', 'teenagers', 'young', 'adults', 'are', 'several', 'red', 'herrings', 'evidence', 'police', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'best', 'job', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'do', 'ever', 'cases', 'too', 'much', 'come', 'forward', 'others', 'determine', 'guilt', 'rather', 'defend', 'innocence']",N/A

They hold internet chat room conferences, interview those involved in the case, get money together for professionals to reexamine the forensic evidence and believe that they have discovered bite marks on the victims that were not covered by the original trial.Unfortunately due to problems with the original documentary and the impact it had, the film makers where prevented from covering actual trial footage during subsequent appeal hearings. Many family members and lawyers who appeared in the original documentary refused to be filmed for this sequel.The father of one of the victims who received attention in the first documentary after handing the film makers a knife which had bloodstains becomes the target of inquiry by the film makers. He agrees to undergo a polygraph.
