This particular complete series one contains eight episodes:""The British are Coming"" starts the series and explains many things that happen later in the series.""The Fallen Madonna"" with the big whatever. Will set a reoccurring theme as Colonel Kurk von Strom has pilfered the painting for his retirement. Keep you eye on it through the series as it becomes a shell game.------------Basic story is of a caf&eacute; owner Ren&eacute;; this is in France during the WWII occupation. He must balance dealing with the local Germans, the Gestapo, the good Resistance, the commie Resistance, having affairs with his female help, dealing with his wife and mother-in-law. Throw in some downed British airmen and some onion soup.I will not go though this series in detail because for those that have not seen it or if it has been while since viewing the series, the surprise factor and the one liners are worth discovering first hand.The series two includes the introduction of an English officer that thinks he can speak French and comes out with statements like ""she has great Fartitude""This is the series where they also nick Helga's knickers with the little swastikas.One nice thing about this series is that they place the name next to the actor at the end of each episode. Most of the actors are well known out side of this series. I was shocked however to find that Gestapo Herr Otto Flick (Richard Gibson) Played British Capt. Newman in Ken Follett's ""The Key to Rebecca"" (1985) and completely changed his accent.I hope the will release the others ""Three Hail Mary's and two Heil Hitler's.""'Allo 'Allo - The Complete Series Three",5,Risque' Rene',1113782400,"04 18, 2005",2005,1748,"['Risque', 'Rene', 'Allo', 'Allo', 'been', '1982', 'just', 'recently', 'become', 'available', 'USA', 'decent', 'media', 'particular', 'complete', 'series', 'one', 'eight', 'episodes', 'British', 'are', 'Coming', 'series', 'many', 'things', 'happen', 'later', 'series', 'Fallen', 'Madonna', 'big', 'whatever', 'Will', 'set', 'reoccurring', 'theme', 'Colonel', 'Kurk', 'von', 'Strom', 'pilfered', 'painting', 'retirement', 'Keep', 'eye', 'series', 'shell', 'game.', 'Basic', 'story', 'caf', 'eacute', 'owner', 'Ren', 'eacute', 'France', 'WWII', 'occupation', 'must', 'balance', 'dealing', 'local', 'Germans', 'Gestapo', 'good', 'Resistance', 'commie', 'Resistance', 'having', 'affairs', 'female', 'help', 'dealing', 'wife', 'mother-in-law', 'Throw', 'downed', 'British', 'airmen', 'onion', 'soup.I', 'will', 'not', 'go', 'series', 'detail', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'been', 'viewing', 'series', 'surprise', 'factor', 'one', 'liners', 'are', 'worth', 'discovering', 'first', 'hand.The', 'series', 'two', 'introduction', 'English', 'officer', 'can', 'speak', 'French', 'out', 'statements', 'great', 'Fartitude', 'series', 'where', 'also', 'nick', 'Helga', 'knickers', 'little', 'swastikas.One', 'nice', 'thing', 'series', 'place', 'name', 'next', 'actor', 'end', 'episode', 'Most', 'actors', 'are', 'well', 'known', 'out', 'side', 'series', 'was', 'shocked', 'however', 'find', 'Gestapo', 'Herr', 'Otto', 'Flick', 'Richard', 'Gibson', 'Played', 'British', 'Capt', 'Newman', 'Ken', 'Follett', 'Key', 'Rebecca', '1985', 'completely', 'changed', 'accent.I', 'hope', 'will', 'release', 'others', 'Three', 'Hail', 'Mary', 'two', 'Heil', 'Hitler', ""'Allo"", ""'Allo"", 'Complete', 'Series', 'Three']",N/A

872334,A3S9L08M1J0R63,B0006Q949G,grouchy,"[6, 6]","The second season of the series expands on the first by introducing one of the funniest characters of the series - the British spy with a French gendarme's alter ego - Crabtree.The second season continues to make fun of the Germans, French, and British.  Watching 30 minutes of this show is an absolute treat.  (It takes you out from a dark mood in 20 minutes or less.)The humor is distinctly British, absurd yet campy, situational yet cerebral.  It is not a mish-mash, it is a wonderfully exciting mixture of different strands of humor.  This makes this series a one-stop shop for anyone who needs to satisfy divergent preferences for good comedy for the members of a household.  Also, if you have preference only for one type of comedy, but do not know what to buy, this is the perfect series to buy.Another nice feature of the series is that all episodes tie into the previous episodes.  Moreover there is a short review given by Rene, the main protagonist, at the beginning of each show.  You do not have to own the first season to understand what happens in the following seasons.Set during World War II, 'Allo 'Allo tells the story of Ren? Artois, a French caf? owner in the village of Nouvion. The village has been occupied by the Germans, who have stolen all of its valuable artifacts. These include the first cuckoo clock ever made and a painting of The Fallen Madonna (known to those who have seen it as The Fallen Madonna with the Big Boobies) by Van Klomp. The commandant of the town has decided to keep them for himself after the war and gets Ren? to hide the painting in his caf?. The Gestapo also want the painting and send Herr Otto Flick to find it.At the same time the caf? is being used as a safe house for two brave but clueless downed British airmen. Ren? is forced to work with the Resistance, who would otherwise shoot him for serving Germans in his caf?. The far-fetched plans of the Resistance to get the airmen back to England, which always fail, are one of the main running gags of the series.Ren? is also trying to keep his affairs with his two waitresses secret from his wife; in addition, the Communist women-only Resistance members are also plotting against Ren? for serving Germans and working with the Gaullist Resistance. The only reason that they do not shoot Ren? is that their leader is in love with him, a fact he has to hide from both his wife and his waitresses. Furthermore, the seemingly gay German Lieutenant Gruber is also continually flirting with Ren?.In the meantime, Ren?'s wife is getting proposals from Monsieur Alphonse, the village undertaker, who is torn between his love for her and his admiration for Ren? as a true hero of France.The companion books are decent.I have pretty much seen the entire series, even those seasons that are not on DVD yet.",5,Listen carefully I will say this only once.

Original plot and every episode has some zany dilemma the characters have to get themselves out of in the funniest of ways. I would never have known that a world war II sitcom could be so funny. If you enjoy British comedy, this is a must-have series for you! The series is based on a French restaurant owner during World War II who is constantly trying to balance his love affairs without his wife finding out, while simultaneously keeping the German soldiers happy along with the French resistance who requires his assistance. This plot setting allows for many unique and funny episodes based on many problems the main character gets himself into such as hiding a famous painting of ""the madonna with the big boobies"" for a german soldier.It isn't 100% clean family fun, as there are references to more mature audience content such as sexuality, homosexuality and prostitution. Most references are funny, subtle, and in good taste.Later episodes usually start with the main character giving a brief synopsis of what happened in the previous episode, so the episodes flow together very well.
