945189,A26QJW82E7L2MJ,B000BMY2M4,C. W.,"[19, 20]","While I agree that ToD was one of television's better attempts at depicting Vietnam, it is terribly unfortunate that music egos prohibited the use of the original soundtrack that aired on with the series. Most notably absent is the opening theme ""Paint It Black"" by the Rolling Stones. While it is most certainly true that there is more to any series or film than its soundtrack, it is equally true that the soundtrack combines with the video to create the finished product. The loss of the original music then is a loss of the part of the actual art as it was originally displayed. It is sad that performers couldn't simply be happy with having their work live on as part of a greater whole. But then for many it isn't so much about art as it is about the money. I know some people think this is nit-picking but the fact is that this in not the ""original"" series as it was originally broadcast and is not as good as the original.  Two of the primary things that characterise the 1960's in America were the music and the Vietnam War. The true original of ToD was a masterpiece of television for it's time and limitations. These new versions are not as good. The new music in most instances, though not all, is awful and actually distracts from the film.Lastly, it is grossly unfair for a studio to release any series with a modified soundtrack, particularly one where in which the soundtrack was such an integral part of the show, without making plain to the purchaser that they are not buying a copy of the show as it was originally broadcast, but a modified version of it.",3,Not as originally aired.,1214006400,"06 21, 2008",2008,1574,"['agree', 'ToD', 'was', 'one', 'television', 'better', 'attempts', 'depicting', 'Vietnam', 'terribly', 'unfortunate', 'music', 'egos', 'prohibited', 'use', 'original', 'soundtrack', 'aired', 'series', 'Most', 'notably', 'absent', 'opening', 'theme', 'Paint', 'Black', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'most', 'certainly', 'true', 'more', 'series', 'film', 'soundtrack', 'equally', 'true', 'soundtrack', 'combines', 'video', 'create', 'finished', 'product', 'loss', 'original', 'music', 'then', 'loss', 'part', 'actual', 'art', 'was', 'originally', 'displayed', 'sad', 'performers', 'could', ""n't"", 'simply', 'be', 'happy', 'having', 'work', 'live', 'part', 'greater', 'whole', 'then', 'many', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'art', 'money', 'know', 'people', 'think', 'nit-picking', 'fact', 'not', 'original', 'series', 'was', 'originally', 'broadcast', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'Two', 'primary', 'things', 'characterise', '1960', 'America', 'were', 'music', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'true', 'original', 'ToD', 'was', 'masterpiece', 'television', 'time', 'limitations', 'new', 'versions', 'are', 'not', 'good', 'new', 'music', 'most', 'instances', 'not', 'awful', 'actually', 'distracts', 'film.Lastly', 'grossly', 'unfair', 'studio', 'release', 'series', 'modified', 'soundtrack', 'particularly', 'one', 'where', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'such', 'integral', 'part', 'show', 'making', 'plain', 'purchaser', 'are', 'not', 'buying', 'copy', 'show', 'was', 'originally', 'broadcast', 'modified', 'version']",Tour of Duty - The Complete Series

Egertson ""comicking""","[3, 4]","I've read the reviews of those that have seen this show before; about how they can't find reason to buy this set without the original score.  To those that have seen the show before and paid attention to the music (perhaps more than the show itself?) I can only state, then this set is not for you.I had not ever heard of this show.  I came across the listing as I was looking for something else (I guess Amazon's ideas do work).  I read the reviews and thought I would give it a try sometime.  I decided to buy the whole series even though I could have purchased the individual sets for less (the sets and the series were both on sale; the series cost $10 more than the individual sets combined).  I would suggest if this happens again, NOT to buy the series box.  It is constructed of cheap cardboard and the 3 sets are merely placed inside.  Only worth it is the series cost is less than the sum of the individual sets.There is an episode in the first season where the actors come into screen talking about Marvin Gaye and begin mouthing the words to whatever song originally played.  Not only was the replacement music not Marvin, it was instrumental.  The guy dancing around in the background ""singing"" to nothing was a little distracting, but this was the only time I noticed.Tour of Duty is a poignant and sometimes disturbing look at what occurred during the Vietnam War.  Each episode in seasons 1 and 3 have a tidbit of information about Vietnam, and the episode often touched on that information and in a very real way.  I was a little kid in the 60's and was sheltered from this war.  I've learned more from this series than from school and recommend it to anyone that has not seen it before.Peace",4,"Never saw this show before, enjoyable without the music",1225152000,"10 28, 2008",2008,1709,"[""'ve"", 'read', 'reviews', 'have', 'seen', 'show', 'how', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'reason', 'buy', 'set', 'original', 'score', 'have', 'seen', 'show', 'paid', 'attention', 'music', 'perhaps', 'more', 'show', 'can', 'only', 'state', 'then', 'set', 'not', 'you.I', 'had', 'not', 'ever', 'heard', 'show', 'came', 'listing', 'was', 'looking', 'something', 'else', 'guess', 'Amazon', 'ideas', 'do', 'work', 'read', 'reviews', 'thought', 'would', 'give', 'try', 'sometime', 'decided', 'buy', 'whole', 'series', 'even', 'could', 'have', 'purchased', 'individual', 'sets', 'less', 'sets', 'series', 'were', 'sale', 'series', 'cost', '10', 'more', 'individual', 'sets', 'combined', 'would', 'suggest', 'again', 'NOT', 'buy', 'series', 'box', 'constructed', 'cheap', 'cardboard', '3', 'sets', 'are', 'merely', 'placed', 'inside', 'Only', 'worth', 'series', 'cost', 'less', 'sum', 'individual', 'episode', 'first', 'season', 'where', 'actors', 'come', 'screen', 'talking', 'Marvin', 'Gaye', 'begin', 'mouthing', 'words', 'whatever', 'song', 'originally', 'played', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'replacement', 'music', 'not', 'Marvin', 'was', 'instrumental', 'guy', 'dancing', 'around', 'background', 'singing', 'nothing', 'was', 'little', 'distracting', 'was', 'only', 'time', 'noticed.Tour', 'Duty', 'poignant', 'sometimes', 'disturbing', 'look', 'what', 'occurred', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'episode', 'seasons', '1', '3', 'have', 'tidbit', 'information', 'Vietnam', 'episode', 'often', 'touched', 'information', 'very', 'real', 'way', 'was', 'little', 'kid', '60', 'was', 'sheltered', 'war', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'more', 'series', 'school', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'not', 'seen', 'before.Peace']",Tour of Duty - The Complete Series

945194,A2VE83MZF98ITY,B000BMY2M4,"FrKurt Messick ""FrKurt Messick""","[48, 56]","'Tour of Duty' is one of my favourite televisions series. It didn't last very long, but while it did, it presented a fairly realistic depiction of life in a squad of soldiers in Vietnam. Together with the series 'China Beach', it began to open doors to a difficult subject for the American public to deal with -- the American public, after all, got to see the Vietnam war almost live, day by day, year after year, in their homes on the television sets, the first war for that to happen. The controversial nature of the war and 'peace' aftermath made dealing with the subject tricky, but the writing, acting and direction in this series was superb.The story follows an infantry company 'in-country', Company B, that is made up of a typical mixture of young, green recruits (often draftees) and a few experienced leaders, on their one-year tour of duty in Vietnam; the series began (and this video begins) in 1967, one of the early hot years of the conflict. The base is a typical firecamp, nicknamed Ladybird, with bunkers, sandbags, jungle surroundings, and lots of mud.Stars of the series include many second-tier Hollywood film and television actors, who are all much better actors than their stature might indicate. Key figures included experienced and battle-hardened Sgt. Zeke Anderson (portrayed by Terence Knox, who has been star or guest star on dozens of television series) and relatively-new officer Lt. Myron Goldman (Stephen Caffrey, soap opera star also noted for some quality film work), as they work together to guide a group of men through the literal and metaphorical minefields of the Vietnam war. Other actors include Eric Bruskotter, Joshua Maurer, Kevin Conroy, Stan Foster, and Tony Becker.In the pilot to the series, the men have a mission to destroy a hidden NVA base headquarters. It depicts the struggles and stress of jungle combat, and portrays the relationships built under fire by the men who come to depend upon each other for their lives.The soundtrack takes a similar device from other Vietnam-era shows and films, that of using music contemporary with the conflict. 'Paint It Black' is the opening theme, an ironic and appropriate song and lyric. Beware, however, if you get it on DVD, that this soundtrack has been altered, including the very riveting opening.This is a superb piece on a troubled time in American history. The series lasted for three years (but the seasons didn't all have full complements of 23-26 episodes each), from 1987 - 1990, for a total of 58 episodes in all.",5,Paint it black,1131408000,"11 8, 2005",2005,2519,"[""'Tour"", 'Duty', 'one', 'favourite', 'televisions', 'series', 'did', ""n't"", 'last', 'very', 'long', 'did', 'presented', 'fairly', 'realistic', 'depiction', 'life', 'squad', 'soldiers', 'Vietnam', 'Together', 'series', ""'China"", 'Beach', 'began', 'open', 'doors', 'difficult', 'subject', 'American', 'public', 'deal', 'American', 'public', 'got', 'see', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'almost', 'live', 'day', 'day', 'year', 'year', 'homes', 'television', 'sets', 'first', 'war', 'happen', 'controversial', 'nature', 'war', ""'peace"", 'aftermath', 'made', 'dealing', 'subject', 'tricky', 'writing', 'acting', 'direction', 'series', 'was', 'superb.The', 'story', 'infantry', 'company', ""'in-country"", 'Company', 'B', 'made', 'typical', 'mixture', 'young', 'green', 'recruits', 'often', 'few', 'experienced', 'leaders', 'one-year', 'tour', 'duty', 'Vietnam', 'series', 'began', 'video', '1967', 'one', 'early', 'hot', 'years', 'conflict', 'base', 'typical', 'firecamp', 'nicknamed', 'Ladybird', 'bunkers', 'sandbags', 'jungle', 'surroundings', 'lots', 'mud.Stars', 'series', 'include', 'many', 'second-tier', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'television', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'actors', 'stature', 'might', 'indicate', 'Key', 'figures', 'included', 'experienced', 'battle-hardened', 'Sgt', 'Zeke', 'Anderson', 'portrayed', 'Terence', 'Knox', 'who', 'been', 'star', 'guest', 'star', 'dozens', 'television', 'series', 'relatively-new', 'officer', 'Lt.', 'Myron', 'Goldman', 'Stephen', 'Caffrey', 'soap', 'opera', 'star', 'also', 'noted', 'quality', 'film', 'work', 'work', 'together', 'guide', 'group', 'men', 'literal', 'metaphorical', 'minefields', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'Other', 'actors', 'include', 'Eric', 'Bruskotter', 'Joshua', 'Maurer', 'Kevin', 'Conroy', 'Stan', 'Foster', 'Tony', 'Becker.In', 'pilot', 'series', 'men', 'have', 'mission', 'destroy', 'hidden', 'NVA', 'base', 'headquarters', 'struggles', 'stress', 'jungle', 'combat', 'relationships', 'built', 'fire', 'men', 'who', 'come', 'depend', 'other', 'lives.The', 'soundtrack', 'similar', 'device', 'other', 'Vietnam-era', 'shows', 'films', 'using', 'music', 'contemporary', 'conflict', ""'Paint"", 'Black', 'opening', 'theme', 'ironic', 'appropriate', 'song', 'lyric', 'Beware', 'however', 'get', 'DVD', 'soundtrack', 'been', 'altered', 'including', 'very', 'riveting', 'opening.This', 'superb', 'piece', 'troubled', 'time', 'American', 'history', 'series', 'lasted', 'three', 'years', 'seasons', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'full', 'complements', '23-26', 'episodes', '1987', '1990', 'total', '58', 'episodes']",Tour of Duty - The Complete Series

945196,A20TZ1MQ0KMJRR,B000BMY2M4,Jaha,"[20, 27]","First off let me clarify that I own the entire series but not in this format.  I own the individual seasons instead.  With that being said I must also say that I love this show.  I was probably about 12 or so when I first discovered the show and was hooked.  When the DVD's came out I loved being able to go back and enjoy them again.  Before the DVD's I had to set my VCR in college to FX for mid-day reruns.Tour of Duty was probably one of the grittiest war dramas ever to appear on TV.  It tackled virtually every issue with regards to the Vietnam War.  Everything from the Tunnels of Cu Chi to Heroin, to protests, drug trade and black market, battle fatigue, prostitution, and more.  This is pretty impressive condsidering the show was produced in the late 80's and most programming was not quite that edgy yet.  Still I applaud the makers of ToD for this.  The show is not only entertaining it is also educational.A couple gripes do exist about the show in general.  One the acting was pretty poor.  I think those who truly loved the show were very much into Vietnam era combat movies, etc... however any casual fan would probably classify the acting as lousy.  nunez is probably the most consistent and compelling character throughout the show.  There are other decent performances but overall most characters are not up to par with more modern day quality shows.Also along with the acting the budgetary constraints on the show kept the action to a minimum and fairly bland.  There is certainly is a ton of action and combat sequences in each episode don't get me wrong, just it isn't all that realistic.  However it gets the job done in providing entertainment and progressing the story.  Just if you compare it to say Hamburger Hill or Full Metal Jacket the sequences are way too unrealistic.My final gripe is with the studio and why the show was ended so abruptly.  I assume the show was cancelled and this drives me nuts because essentially the show never ends.  You can tell by the last episode the show was gearing up for a finale but it never comes!  In fact the Lieutenant barely even appears in the final episode and he was one of the biggest characters.  Most likely the show was ending and the networks just pulled the plug on it before they ever finished it off.  Just would have been nice to finally see what happened to Danny, Sarge, Leu, and the others the way the show was clearly meant to end.All in all the show is great.  One of my all time favorites ever aired.  The poor acting and sometimes unrealistic action can easily be over-looked because of the great messages each episode was delivering.  I was born after the Vietnam War and still understand the importance it has had on our lives.  This show aimed to make that war a reality and it succeeded.  Don't worry too much about the soundtrack as everyone else is complaining about.  I don't know why this would take the show completely down from a 4-5 star rating to a 2.  If you wanna hear songs from the 60's and 70's then buy some old CD's.  Sure I remember the music being great in the show but whatever.  The show is still there.  I understand that the generic free liscense music they replaced it with is rather boring and doesn't help the mood of the show all that much it certainly doesn't make the show any less watchable.  Also the music issue makes Tour of Duty fall into that category of ""cliche"" Vietnam movie.  You know the type.  Virtually every Vietnam movie I have ever seen has had ""We Have to Get out of this Place"" by the Animals somewhere in it.  And I have seen just about every Vietnam movie ever made.Do yourself a favor.  If you love Vietnam War themed movies or material then you must buy this show.

I don't know about others, but I wanted this series because I was there and that music was our music and that music and the war were tied together. So if you want to see an excellent series but w/o the authentic music, then go for it. For me it's like seeing Apocalypse Now with cover songs ... Robert Duval playing Beethoven instead of Wagner????[Let me say that some of you may have also looked for dvds of the most popular series of that time China Beach whcid ran from 1988-1991. The series is ""not available,"" tho you may surf the internet and find maybe ahem something. At any rate, the dvd advertised here of CB is the first episode only. The cd of the music is totally different. It's like going to see one of those Beatle bands -- just doesn't cut it. In fact, if I remember right, one of the cuts is Lennon singing Imagine! There is another cut with Dana Delaney singing something. (also not from the series)]If I were you, I'd go online and search for the original Tour of Duty series. (Remember the dvds have been transferred from VHS.) I'd go the Canadian route rather than the Chinese, if you know what I mean. But having Tour of Duty with the original music is the way to go if you're a boomer. If you just want to see a good series, two years? about the war with good acting, then ToD should suffice.A word about music rights. Much of the music of this period is now in the public domain. I read somewhere that producers were not releasing dvds of some Vietnam programs because the public did not want to see them and had low viewer numbers. They got rave reviews from the critics, however.It's not the music rights that prevented them from releasing the series -- most of them -- I think they just don't think enough people would buy them.

945205,A14I4VHJAZ8LC,B000BMY2M4,patrick,"[2, 9]","Many people love this series, I know, or tend to remember it fondly if they havent seen it recently, I too liked it , watched it each week in the 80s, but a friend about 10 yrs older than i, who was an Australian  Vietnam  vet, openly ridiculed it from the start, to an extent you couldn't watch it with him, he wouldn't shut up mocking it, his right, of course, having been there, in country in 'Nam, he was wounded by an RPG and fought one Cong who appeared had a machete bent on dealing with the wounded, Rick ended up shanking the  the guy with a small knife that is in the First Aid kit for cutting bandages dressing wounds, ended up inflicting some wounds with it instead.I saw a post on the China Beach thread referring to both shows as 'great shows' of Vietnam war period,China Beach probably is,TOD, not really, imo.About a year ago, it started to run in syndication on Tv in Australia, late nights, I saw 2 episodes, one was the pilot, I think, one was about Tunnels and 'tunnel-rats' unit, Terence Knox goes down into a tunnel with another soldier, maybe one of the black GIs, when one of the special Tunnel rats is ejected KIA by the VC in the tunnel.I have to say this, the show has its strong-points, most of this is concerned with exploring issues and themes.It harkens to the old 1960s Vic Morrow series ""Combat"", set nowhere in particular in France in months after d-day invasion, a small squad of GIs, much like the Bravos in TOD, wander about the countryside encountering the odd nest of angry German infantry, who are usually considerate enough to break cover run straight out in front of them firing Schmeissers, only to be promptly KIAd (without blood or flesh-mess)  by Saunders Thompson, Little John and Cages Garands , or Kirbys BAR.  Combat also often, if not always, explored war and combat issues, of various kinds, some episodes were better than others. Two of the best concerned the Sergeant is taken prisoner by the 'krauts', in amongst the other GI POWs is a German plant, played by Claude Akins. Another great one was the one with a village priest who was also a german Agent:there was also a 2-part Hamburger Hill style story of attempting to take a hill dogedly held by Germans. Only to finally take it, at heavy cost, in time to be ordered to abandon it, by High command.Tour of Duty, to me, is Combat with longer grass  and Asian ""Krauts"" and civilians.In both shows, the combat scenes are rarely realistic or even credible. Sometimes in both shows, they verged into the ridiculous.Both units repeatedly walked unwittingly into German/VC/NVA perfect ambushes killing zones, only to escape being wiped out due to a crazy last-minute bungle by the enemy troops, such as a nervous VC pulling back his AK47 rifle-bolt at the last moments, making a loud click ,  alerting the GIs.. who hear it, go to ground for a few seconds, then continue on regardless, but still somehow escape mandatory annihilation. Even when a nervous enemy soldier doesnt blow the ambush, despite the MG42 or whatever MGs the Cong had opening up at 20 yards range on a tightly bunched group of our heroes, they rarely achieve any more execution that 1 or 2 WIAs. Usually ""expendables', like in Star Trek, not guys we recognize who are far too important to be successfuly greased  by Charlie.Although I think Bravos' quiet Japanese Nisei guy is KIA eventually.Somewhat ironically, the only guy dear to them Bravo  ever lost,  in an Asian war,  was an Asian-American.Both shows had a charismatic platoon sergeants, although Terence Knoxs Sergeant has a little more personality with his headband,  southern accent and wry humour, than Vic Morrow's sullen but memorable .45 Thompson-carrying sgt Saunders.TOD has an additional strength that Combat lacked, the great 60s soundtrack, but I have heard the DVD sets lack the original sound-tracks for legal reasons. Combat just had the same trudging, but again memorable,  set of ""Combat""  theme and scores..and the odd ripple of a French accordion.to sum up, TOD has something to say, but it has dated , not that well, the battle scenes do not match todays standard such as Private Ryan or Flags of our Fathers,they are often farcical, with 'Ruiz' standing out in the open banging away from the hip with an M60,  the strength of both shows is exploring some war issues, with acting which is adequate to fairly  good in both shows,  with TOD scoring  additional points with music soundtrack and capturing with some success, the atmosphere of the period.If you want to know what battle was like in Vietnam, no, it takes you nowhere with that, no realism whatsover, but if you want to see what were some genuine features and issues of Nam explored with some fact and entertainment value, and enjoy 60s music and atmosphere, yes, its a buy.",3,"Tour of Duty = ""COMBAT"" with long grass & an Asian

I served a tour in the same AO in the same time period that this takes place. (I'm afraid there are no mountains there, other than Nui Ba Den on the Cambodian border).The characters are believable, are developed as characters throughout the series, and you come to know them and care about them (unlike the characters in ""Band of Brothers"").  Two minor quibbles: 1.) Some one with Infantry experience should have coached the character ""Ruiz"" on how an M-60 is fired.  If you fire an M-60 like he does you'll: a) hit very little, and b) burn out the barrel. 2.) The producers felt compelled to introduce round-eyed love interests for the main characters as the series went into the second and third seasons.  Enlisted men and junior officers in combat units lived in a world devoid of Caucasian women (unless they spent time in an Evac hospital).In spite of these quibbles, a terrific series and a bargain for 99, 40-minute stories.  The interplay between the young lieutenant and his 3-tour platoon sergeant alone is worth the purchase price.On viewing the series  again, I would add the following.  The first season used a nice convention of beginning each episode with a black screen with white letters giving some factoid about the Vietnam War which would be central to that episode.  The second season moved the unit from Chu Lai down to Tan Son Nhut airbase in Saigon, which allowed the episodes to be broader than just missions in the bush.  It also introduced love interests for both Lt Goldman and SGT Anderson and the series began to address issues like racial tension and drug use.  The third season unfortunately decided it needed star power, introducing Carl Weathers as a SOG Col, and Lee Majors as an aging enlisted man.  They did okay, but star power wasn't needed and was a bit of a distraction.  The seasons ends with some of the platoon members going home and the difficulties they encounter reintegrating with civilized society.If you liked this series, consider buying the DVD of the HBO series of short stories entitled ""Vietnam War Story"".  Good writing, good acting, realistic depiction of Vietnam as experienced by the GI, and no howkie love interests.
