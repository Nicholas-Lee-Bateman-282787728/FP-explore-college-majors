And the premise that a man is more happy being whipped than being single is total BS. The only real funny part was that Tony Rock was coaching his friend from a book that Anthony Anderson's character from the first movie wrote called "" The Man's Guide to Pimpin Panderan and Philanderan"" That was the only time I slightly cracked a smile. Oh and Ms. Ford was looking good which might ne worth the price if you pick it out the $.99 used and forgettable bargain bin at the local trade in video hut.",1,Just bad and not very clever,1237852800,"03 24, 2009",2009,612,"['first', 'movie', 'was', 'kind', 'clever', 'one', 'was', 'just', 'wack', 'man', 'would', 'put', 'up', 'crap', 'ever', 'premise', 'man', 'more', 'happy', 'being', 'whipped', 'being', 'single', 'total', 'BS', 'only', 'real', 'funny', 'part', 'was', 'Tony', 'Rock', 'was', 'coaching', 'friend', 'book', 'Anthony', 'Anderson', 'character', 'first', 'movie', 'wrote', 'called', 'Man', 'Guide', 'Pimpin', 'Panderan', 'Philanderan', 'was', 'only', 'time', 'slightly', 'cracked', 'smile', 'Oh', 'Ms.', 'Ford', 'was', 'looking', 'good', 'might', 'ne', 'price', 'pick', '.99', 'used', 'forgettable', 'bargain', 'bin', 'local', 'trade', 'video', 'hut']",Three Can Play That Game

This movie was funny thanks to tony rock mainly and everyone else had funny things hear and there but felt kind of generic, predictable,and seen before.as far as a independent movie its pretty good. they knew that they had big shoes to fill from the first one though which had a power cast behind it like Moriss Chesnut, Mo'Nique, Gabrielle Union, Anthony Anderson, Bobby Brown, Tamala Jones and Wendy Raquel Robbinson, but one of my biggest problems was Mrs. Fox herself. In the original, the character Shante Smith seemed like a girlfriend giving the viewers advise (like one good friend to another) and the character seeme kind of peaceful and downhome with a few funny lines and gestures here and there, in this one she was all in your face and kinda drag queenish alot with the over makeup and dramatic hair, and just a coldness about the character so much that the original Shante wasnt they were completely different people, I liked the old one better because she felt like ""My girl shante"". In 3 can play that game she's  ""The almighty Shante""  larger than life, bow to her, no woman is ever as good as her. like a drag queen.I still love Vivica though, thats my girl, from Independence day to set it off and even still with this movie. And dont get me wrong im not saying she did a bad job acting, but the characters arent the same women at all, but she still made her funny and likeableIts a good movie on its own, as a sequal it sucks though.just my opinion, I (litterally) just finished the movie for a second time,so dont compare when you watch it, you might be disapointed too.",3,The firs one  IS SOOOOO MUCH BETTER,1206316800,"03 24, 2008",2008,1690,"['Look', 'Ima', 'Vivica', 'Fox', 'fan', 'seen', '85', '%', 'movies', 'consider', 'somewhat', 'fan', 'miss', 'Fox', 'movie', 'was', 'funny', 'thanks', 'tony', 'rock', 'mainly', 'everyone', 'else', 'had', 'funny', 'things', 'hear', 'there', 'felt', 'kind', 'generic', 'predictable', 'seen', 'before.as', 'far', 'independent', 'movie', 'pretty', 'good', 'knew', 'had', 'big', 'shoes', 'fill', 'first', 'one', 'though', 'had', 'power', 'cast', 'Moriss', 'Chesnut', ""Mo'Nique"", 'Gabrielle', 'Union', 'Anthony', 'Anderson', 'Bobby', 'Brown', 'Tamala', 'Jones', 'Wendy', 'Raquel', 'Robbinson', 'one', 'biggest', 'problems', 'was', 'Mrs.', 'Fox', 'original', 'character', 'Shante', 'Smith', 'seemed', 'girlfriend', 'giving', 'viewers', 'advise', 'one', 'good', 'friend', 'character', 'seeme', 'kind', 'peaceful', 'downhome', 'few', 'funny', 'lines', 'gestures', 'here', 'there', 'one', 'was', 'face', 'kinda', 'drag', 'queenish', 'alot', 'over', 'makeup', 'dramatic', 'hair', 'just', 'coldness', 'character', 'so', 'much', 'original', 'Shante', 'wasnt', 'were', 'completely', 'different', 'people', 'liked', 'old', 'one', 'better', 'felt', 'girl', 'shante', '3', 'can', 'play', 'game', 'almighty', 'Shante', 'larger', 'life', 'bow', 'woman', 'ever', 'as', 'good', 'drag', 'queen.I', 'still', 'love', 'Vivica', 'thats', 'girl', 'Independence', 'day', 'set', 'off', 'even', 'still', 'movie', 'dont', 'get', 'wrong', 'im', 'not', 'saying', 'did', 'bad', 'job', 'acting', 'characters', 'arent', 'same', 'women', 'still', 'made', 'funny', 'good', 'movie', 'own', 'sequal', 'though.just', 'opinion', 'litterally', 'just', 'finished', 'movie', 'second', 'time', 'so', 'dont', 'compare', 'when', 'watch', 'might', 'be', 'disapointed', 'too']",Three Can Play That Game

1125704,A8SCX6VUTE05H,B0010NXURQ,"Nuisance ""the rebel""","[0, 0]","Two Can Play That Game caught me off guard. When I first started watching it I started rolling my eyes. As the movie progressed I was laughing and was enjoying myself. The way the movie ended threw me off completely but that is what made that movie special. It tricks you into thinking you can predict how the movie is going to end up then BAM! Nice surprise. Three Can Play That Game is a soulless, unfunny, and mean-spirited sequel that is just as corny and weak as you would expect a direct-to-DVD sequel to Two Can Play That Game to be.Story: Byron Thomson is caught by his girlfriend Tiffany(Jazsmin Lewis) in a compromising position with Carla(Kellita Smith), a TV executive. From then on Tiffany seeks the advise provided by Shante Smith(Vivica Fox) to help manipulate Byron and the relationship. Byron uses the advise from his best friend Gizzard(Tony Rock)to manipulate the relationship. Byron ends up using Shante's advise to help him manipulate Tiffany and Tiffany follows the advise of her friends, Linda(Terry Vaughn) and Monica(Rashan Ali) to manipulate the relationship.As you can see the movie is very and confusing plus it doesnt even have the good intentions of its predecessor. Two Can Play That Game had a great message: You cant turn love into a game to be controlled because you will lose. Plus it was pretty clever in how it conveyed that message. This movie doesnt seem to have much to say plus its quite annoying to see these attractive brothers and sisters act like childish high-schoolers throughout the movie. I wouldnt have a problem if it were a means to an end but its not. Add that to the fact that this movie tries to use the same type of jokes from the first movie and fails.Vivica tries to inject some personality into her character but she comes across as a huge douche bag(if you can call a female that), whereas in the first one she was a likable person with a wayward view of relationships and men. And her performance in this movie is quite forced. Jason George, Tony Rock and Jazsmin Lewis all give forced performances and it shows. Did I forget to mention that this movie is boring. Lethally boring.In conclusion Three Can Play That Game is a direct-to-DVD sequel that will join the ranks of other bad direct-to-video sequels like House Party 4 and Home Alone 4. The humor falls flat and the movie doesnt even have heart(which the first movie has). Even if you havent seen the Two Can Play That Game you wont like this one. This is Two Can Play That Game for the Lifetime crowd.
