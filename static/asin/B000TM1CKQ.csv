1091538,A2OZBJ58CML9OS,B000TM1CKQ,A. Gammill,"[11, 14]","Note: This review contains Spoilers.  I have to admit, I was a little concerned when the second season began.  I mean, having Marshall and Lily break up was kind of a downer.  But I'm glad I decided to keep watching, because this year easily contains some of the show's funniest episodes.  My wife and I put on ""Slap Bet"" anytime we need a little pick-me-up.  And of course, there's the ""Robin Sparkles"" episode, in which Cobie Smulders (like the show itself, a criminally-underrated comic actress) really gets a chance to shine.  ""Swarley"" is a Barney Stinson classic.  And ""Arrivederci, Fiero"" may be the biggest laugh-getter of the season.How I Met Your Mother may never quite achieve Classic Sitcom status.  And you know, that's really fine with me.  I wouldn't want too much success to go to their heads.  But I'll keep watching and laughing myself silly.",5,Another great season of an underrated show,1189036800,"09 6, 2007",2007,860,"['Note', 'review', 'Spoilers', 'have', 'admit', 'was', 'little', 'concerned', 'when', 'second', 'season', 'began', 'mean', 'having', 'Marshall', 'Lily', 'break', 'up', 'was', 'kind', 'downer', ""'m"", 'glad', 'decided', 'keep', 'watching', 'year', 'easily', 'show', 'funniest', 'episodes', 'wife', 'put', 'Slap', 'Bet', 'anytime', 'need', 'little', 'pick-me-up', 'course', 'Robin', 'Sparkles', 'episode', 'Cobie', 'Smulders', 'show', 'criminally-underrated', 'comic', 'actress', 'really', 'chance', 'shine', 'Swarley', 'Barney', 'Stinson', 'classic', 'Arrivederci', 'Fiero', 'may', 'be', 'biggest', 'laugh-getter', 'season.How', 'Met', 'Mother', 'may', 'never', 'quite', 'achieve', 'Classic', 'Sitcom', 'status', 'know', 'really', 'fine', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'too', 'much', 'success', 'go', 'heads', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'watching', 'laughing', 'silly']",How I Met Your Mother: Season 2

1091541,A8TM0MI3D9T29,B000TM1CKQ,Brett Corkins,"[0, 1]","How do you rebound from a cliff hanger like Marshall and Lily breaking up? Right where you left off.Season two starts moments after we learn about the split with Barney and Robin rushing to Marshall's side. I love that they let the break up go on for a while and didn't opt for a quick one episode fix. Therein lies a big reason I feel that the show is so wildly successful, because they explore real situations. They realize break ups hurt and they let Marshall hurt...and hurt...and hurt some more. All the while his friends rally around him to help him try and forget, or at least not dwell on, what happened. In classic HIMYM form, some very funny results ensue, from Barney taking him to a strip club to Ted taking him to a baseball game (ending with Marshall freaking out on a newly engaged couple) and Robin, of course, taking him to the gun range.Now that's not all that happens. Of course, Robin and Ted are officially an item so we get ample comedy from them. Lily comes back from San Francisco to commence a funny round of apartment hunting. Ted finds out his parents got a divorce. And Barney...well, Barney does what Barney does best, chases women. All of that leads up to Marshall and Lily's wedding.Their wedding could've been handled in so many different ways, and it could've failed in so many ways. However, they cover the wedding over the span of two episodes. Everything from pre-wedding jitters to how everything will always go wrong, to their own private ceremony headed by none other than Barney. They did it perfectly.All in all, season two builds upon what season one started in all the right ways. There are no midseason lulls, only laughs offered throughout.

1091544,A278AF56R7J86,B000TM1CKQ,"C. Crockett ""Domino713""","[33, 35]","This show takes the audience on a bit of a backwards journey down memory lane. The premise has the narrator (Ted) telling his two children the story of how he met their mother. Along the way we meet Lilly and Marshall (known to each other by the sickeningly sweet nicknames Marshmellow and Lillypad) who are a funny, picture perfect cute couple (well...they are now, anyway, after their relationship trouble in season 1). We also meet Robin (Ted's on again, off again girlfriend who turns out *not* to be his future wife) and that rascally womanizing egomaniac, Barney.I think the casting in this show was outstanding. Neil Patrick Harris shines as Barney, and Alyson Hannigan puts forth a brilliant performance each episode as Lilly. The character of Ted is a good fit for Josh Radnor (who we have thus far only seen in small bit parts in various films, such asNot Another Teen Movie (Unrated Director's Cut). Jason Segal and Cobie Smulders round out the cast nicely as Marshall and Robin. (and if you think you might recognize the voice of the ""older Ted Mosbey"" during the narrating portion of the show...it's probably because you do. The narrator is actually Bob Saget).Season 2 pretty much picks up where season 1 left off. In a bizarre case of cold feet, Lilly breaks off her engagement with Marshall and moves to California for an art internship. Marshall is left in New York, alone and heartbroken, while Robin and Ted strike out in their new relationship (despite the fact that they both know they want very different things out of life). Barney, as always, provides much of the comic relief throughout the show, and remains his usual womanizing self. Season 2, from start to finish, is hilarious. I particularly enjoyed the episodes ""Ted Mosbey, Architect"" and (my all time favorite episode so far) ""Robin Sparkles"". When you watch them, you'll see why (I seriously couldn't erase the episode Robin Sparkes from my TiVo for like a month, because I just kept re-watching it!).The dialogue is sharp and witty, and the interpersonal relationships within the group are really fun to watch. I can't ever get through an episode without laughing out loud at least once, and I think thats a good sign for a comedy sitcom. This is situational comedy at it's finest, and while the storylines and situations aren't believable in an apply-it-to-real-life sort of way, it's nonetheless entertaining and humorous, which is sort of the point.The season 1 box set contained at least 5 episodes with writer/director/producer commentary (with the season finale episode containing commentary from the 5 principle actors). Hopefully season 2 will have the same, because a lot of the commentary is really entertaining!Bottom line, this is a great show. I'm going out on a limb here (a very high, terrifying limb) but I think this show has the potential to at least partially fill the shoes of shows like ""Friends"" and ""Everybody Loves Raymond"", as far as filling the half-hour comedy sitcom void is concerned. Give it a try, and I promise you won't be disappointed.",5,Hilarious and a lot of fun -- truly an original idea!,1186617600,"08 9, 2007",2007,3054,"['show', 'audience', 'bit', 'backwards', 'journey', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'premise', 'narrator', 'Ted', 'telling', 'two', 'children', 'story', 'how', 'met', 'mother', 'way', 'meet', 'Lilly', 'Marshall', 'known', 'other', 'sickeningly', 'sweet', 'nicknames', 'Marshmellow', 'Lillypad', 'who', 'are', 'funny', 'picture', 'perfect', 'cute', 'couple', 'well', 'are', 'now', 'anyway', 'relationship', 'trouble', 'season', '1', 'also', 'meet', 'Robin', 'Ted', 'again', 'off', 'again', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'out', '*not*', 'be', 'future', 'wife', 'rascally', 'womanizing', 'egomaniac', 'Barney.I', 'think', 'casting', 'show', 'was', 'outstanding', 'Neil', 'Patrick', 'Harris', 'shines', 'Barney', 'Alyson', 'Hannigan', 'forth', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'episode', 'Lilly', 'character', 'Ted', 'good', 'fit', 'Josh', 'Radnor', 'who', 'have', 'thus', 'far', 'only', 'seen', 'small', 'bit', 'parts', 'various', 'films', 'such', 'Teen', 'Movie', 'Unrated', 'Director', 'Cut', 'Jason', 'Segal', 'Cobie', 'Smulders', 'round', 'out', 'cast', 'nicely', 'Marshall', 'Robin', 'think', 'might', 'recognize', 'voice', 'older', 'Ted', 'Mosbey', 'narrating', 'portion', 'show', 'probably', 'do', 'narrator', 'actually', 'Bob', 'Saget', '.Season', '2', 'pretty', 'much', 'up', 'where', 'season', '1', 'left', 'off', 'bizarre', 'case', 'cold', 'feet', 'Lilly', 'engagement', 'Marshall', 'moves', 'California', 'art', 'internship', 'Marshall', 'left', 'New', 'York', 'alone', 'heartbroken', 'Robin', 'Ted', 'strike', 'out', 'new', 'relationship', 'fact', 'know', 'want', 'very', 'different', 'things', 'life', 'Barney', 'always', 'much', 'comic', 'relief', 'show', 'usual', 'womanizing', 'self', 'Season', '2', 'start', 'finish', 'hilarious', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'episodes', 'Ted', 'Mosbey', 'Architect', 'time', 'favorite', 'episode', 'so', 'far', 'Robin', 'Sparkles', 'When', 'watch', ""'ll"", 'see', 'why', 'seriously', 'could', ""n't"", 'erase', 'episode', 'Robin', 'Sparkes', 'TiVo', 'month', 'just', 'kept', 're-watching', '.The', 'dialogue', 'sharp', 'witty', 'interpersonal', 'relationships', 'group', 'are', 'really', 'fun', 'watch', 'ca', ""n't"", 'ever', 'get', 'episode', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'least', 'once', 'think', 'good', 'sign', 'comedy', 'sitcom', 'situational', 'comedy', 'finest', 'storylines', 'situations', 'are', ""n't"", 'believable', 'apply-it-to-real-life', 'sort', 'way', 'nonetheless', 'entertaining', 'humorous', 'sort', 'point.The', 'season', '1', 'box', 'set', 'contained', 'least', '5', 'episodes', 'writer/director/producer', 'commentary', 'season', 'finale', 'episode', 'containing', 'commentary', '5', 'principle', 'actors', 'Hopefully', 'season', '2', 'will', 'have', 'same', 'lot', 'commentary', 'really', 'entertaining', 'Bottom', 'line', 'great', 'show', ""'m"", 'going', 'out', 'limb', 'here', 'very', 'high', 'terrifying', 'limb', 'think', 'show', 'potential', 'least', 'partially', 'fill', 'shoes', 'shows', 'Friends', 'Everybody', 'Raymond', 'as', 'far', 'filling', 'half-hour', 'comedy', 'sitcom', 'void', 'concerned', 'Give', 'try', 'promise', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed']",How I Met Your Mother: Season 2

1091553,AUUH6Z8MSGGF,B000TM1CKQ,Haunted Flower,"[1, 2]","""How I Met Your Mother"" Season 2 continues the story of Ted's search for his future bride and mother of his children. All cast members return including Josh Radnor, Jason Segel, Alyson Hannigan, Cobie Smulders (yes she DOES), and Neil Patrick Harris as well as Bob Saget narrating as older Ted Mosby. Spoiler Alert! At the end of Season 1, Lily and Marshall broke up. At the end of Season 2 is one of the best television weddings I have ever seen. Also at the end of Season 1, Ted and Robin got together despite fundamental differences in their future paths. I won't spoil what happens to them by the end....This is a funny season where the ""Slap Bet"" originates wherein Marshall earns the right to slap Barney at five times, whenever he chooses. We also get to see Lily act in a terrible play and Barney respond with his own terrible one man show about a robot finding love with a toaster. Robin's past as a pop star in Canada comes back to haunt her! Ted after Lily comes to work with him temporarily finally gets the guts to show off his better architecture design to his boss and has lots of issues with leadership at work throughout the season. Barney meets his match in a cougar played by Jane Seymour. And of course with a wedding on the way there are plenty of memorable moments to be had at a bridal shower, bachelor party, the wedding, and Marshall saying goodbye to the end of an era -- his Fiero car that breaks down before hitting 200,000 miles and all the defining moments that car created. And the gang isn't able to watch the Super Bowl live and frantically try to avoid finding out any news about the outcome so they can watch it recorded together.The show has eased into a comfortable place where you can enjoy the characters after Marshall undergoes suffering and then Lily is made to pay until the two can gradually reconcile. You know already Robin isn't the mother so it's just a waiting game for her and Ted to break it off. Bob Saget is an excellent narrator! Definitely check this show out, I'm sold on it now. The wedding was sooo sweet! And you know I don't like too much touchy feely stuff.Bonus Features:There is a seven minute gag reel, the funniest moments of which involve several ""almost"" kisses between random cast members. ""How I Made Your Mother"" ended up being a pretty great making of showing rehearsals all the way to final cuts through the episode. What made it great was it turns out in that episode where there was a proposal, it was REAL.

1091554,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000TM1CKQ,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[4, 5]","SPOILERS alert...especially IF you haven't seen the first season.So this is Season 2 of HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER, and, thank the almighty chewtoy, they haven't let up on the funny. For me, the first season snuck up, although it didn't take too long before it became my current top sitcom. What sold me was the combination of great character dynamics, the off-beat, sometimes snarky humor, and that whiff of romance (that dude Ted can carry a hell of a torch). This gang were folks I could relate to - yes, even Barney, the unapologetically self-absorbed misogynist who still somehow wormed into my good graces. And, actually, even Barney came thru for his buds when the chips were down.The premise of HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER states that Ted, sometime in the future, will meet the woman of his dreams. In Season 2 Bob Saget returns to reprise his voice-over role of future Ted as he persists in regaling his kids with the convoluted story of how he met their mother. What the show tantalizingly fails to reveal is the mom's identity, and the how and the when. And Season 2 keeps us in suspense. Starting with last season's finale and leading into the Season 2 opener, things have changed some. Lily and likable goof Marshall are no longer engaged, and Marshall is extremely resentful. But Ted and Robin are now an item. Barney, though, is still a raging womanizer. This status quo would remain for several episodes. The show makes no bones about Robin not being the mother of future Ted's kids, so, it was a fun yet bittersweet time watching Robin and Ted go thru the ups and downs of their romance.In a very good sophomore season, most of the episodes are solid and several sparkle. ""Slap Bet"" (my favorite, and, it seems, everyone else's) dredges up something embarassing from Robin's past, as well as introduces a wagering system paid up in vicious slaps. ""Ted Mosby, Architect"" focuses on Robin's disdain for Ted's vocational small talk and on Barney handing Ted a great pick-up line, which he then runs away with. In ""Swarley"" Barney, to his dismay, is saddled with a nickname (forFirefly - The Complete Seriesfans, Morena Baccarin guest stars as Marshall's crazy-eyed date). Finally, ""Showdown"" has Barney competing in The Price Is Right and meeting his dad, Bob Barker.Pretty good special features here: The gag reel is definitely worth checking out; there's the 17-minute-long ""How We Make Your Mother"" segment in which key scenes are shown in read thrus, in rehearsal, and, finally, in the actual shooting (this one showcases a truly awesome moment for two of the extras); commentaries on 7 episodes (""Where Were We,"" ""Swarley,"" ""Slap Bet,"" ""Single Stamina,"" ""Arrivederci Fiero,"" ""Bachelor Party,"" and ""Showdown""); additional scenes for ""Moving Day"" (more of Barney's Top Ten list, hilarious!), ""Showdown"" (Barney's Best Man speech), and ""Bachelor Party"" (extra footage of the adult entertainer, but it's not all that); the wonderfully cheesy Robin Sparkles video in its entirety; and the weird ""Hey Beautiful"" video, which contains the show's hummable theme tune (I say ""weird"" because the video borrows clips from the show and then superimposes lips singing the song lyrics over the mouths of the show's characters).HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER is a well-constructed show and effortlessly navigates a spectrum of tones, from madcap to poignant, from romantic to subversive. The likable cast maintains its comfy chemistry, although the go-to guy for laughs remains the pitch perfect Neil Patrick Harris and his outrageously weasely character Barney. If nothing else, Barney's certainly introduced into the sitcom lexicon phrases such as ""Suit up"" and ""Awesome!"" Oh, and one more. With some help from Wayne Brady and a cameo by former Dallas Cowboy running back Emmett Smith, HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER Season 2 is funny and warm and unpredictable, not to mention, simply legen - wait for it! - dary.",4,"""Let's go to the mall, everybody!""",1201996800,"02 3, 2008",2008,3891,"['SPOILERS', 'alert', 'especially', 'IF', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'first', 'season.So', 'Season', '2', 'HOW', 'MET', 'YOUR', 'MOTHER', 'thank', 'almighty', 'chewtoy', 'have', ""n't"", 'let', 'up', 'funny', 'first', 'season', 'snuck', 'up', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'long', 'became', 'current', 'top', 'sitcom', 'What', 'sold', 'was', 'combination', 'great', 'character', 'dynamics', 'off-beat', 'sometimes', 'snarky', 'humor', 'whiff', 'romance', 'dude', 'Ted', 'can', 'carry', 'hell', 'torch', 'gang', 'were', 'folks', 'could', 'relate', 'yes', 'even', 'Barney', 'unapologetically', 'self-absorbed', 'misogynist', 'who', 'still', 'somehow', 'wormed', 'good', 'graces', 'actually', 'even', 'Barney', 'came', 'thru', 'buds', 'when', 'chips', 'were', 'down.The', 'premise', 'HOW', 'MET', 'YOUR', 'MOTHER', 'Ted', 'sometime', 'future', 'will', 'meet', 'woman', 'dreams', 'Season', '2', 'Bob', 'Saget', 'reprise', 'voice-over', 'role', 'future', 'Ted', 'regaling', 'kids', 'convoluted', 'story', 'how', 'met', 'mother', 'What', 'show', 'tantalizingly', 'reveal', 'mom', 'identity', 'how', 'when', 'Season', '2', 'keeps', 'suspense', 'Starting', 'last', 'season', 'finale', 'leading', 'Season', '2', 'opener', 'things', 'have', 'changed', 'Lily', 'likable', 'goof', 'Marshall', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'engaged', 'Marshall', 'extremely', 'resentful', 'Ted', 'Robin', 'are', 'now', 'item', 'Barney', 'though', 'still', 'raging', 'womanizer', 'status', 'quo', 'would', 'remain', 'several', 'episodes', 'show', 'bones', 'Robin', 'not', 'being', 'mother', 'future', 'Ted', 'kids', 'so', 'was', 'fun', 'yet', 'bittersweet', 'time', 'watching', 'Robin', 'Ted', 'go', 'ups', 'downs', 'romance.In', 'very', 'good', 'sophomore', 'season', 'most', 'episodes', 'are', 'solid', 'several', 'sparkle', 'Slap', 'Bet', 'favorite', 'everyone', 'else', 'up', 'something', 'embarassing', 'Robin', 'past', 'as', 'well', 'introduces', 'wagering', 'system', 'paid', 'up', 'vicious', 'slaps', 'Ted', 'Mosby', 'Architect', 'Robin', 'disdain', 'Ted', 'vocational', 'small', 'talk', 'Barney', 'handing', 'Ted', 'great', 'pick-up', 'line', 'then', 'away', 'Swarley', 'Barney', 'dismay', 'saddled', 'nickname', 'forFirefly', 'Complete', 'Seriesfans', 'Morena', 'Baccarin', 'guest', 'stars', 'Marshall', 'crazy-eyed', 'date', 'Finally', 'Showdown', 'Barney', 'competing', 'Price', 'Is', 'Right', 'meeting', 'dad', 'Bob', 'Barker.Pretty', 'good', 'special', 'features', 'here', 'gag', 'reel', 'definitely', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', '17-minute-long', 'How', 'Make', 'Mother', 'segment', 'key', 'scenes', 'are', 'shown', 'read', 'thrus', 'rehearsal', 'finally', 'actual', 'shooting', 'one', 'truly', 'awesome', 'moment', 'two', 'extras', 'commentaries', '7', 'episodes', 'Where', 'Were', 'Swarley', 'Slap', 'Bet', 'Single', 'Stamina', 'Arrivederci', 'Fiero', 'Bachelor', 'Party', 'Showdown', 'additional', 'scenes', 'Moving', 'Day', 'more', 'Barney', 'Top', 'Ten', 'list', 'hilarious', 'Showdown', 'Barney', 'Best', 'Man', 'speech', 'Bachelor', 'Party', 'extra', 'footage', 'adult', 'entertainer', 'not', 'wonderfully', 'cheesy', 'Robin', 'Sparkles', 'video', 'entirety', 'weird', 'Hey', 'Beautiful', 'video', 'show', 'hummable', 'theme', 'tune', 'say', 'weird', 'video', 'clips', 'show', 'then', 'lips', 'singing', 'song', 'lyrics', 'mouths', 'show', 'characters', '.HOW', 'MET', 'YOUR', 'MOTHER', 'well-constructed', 'show', 'effortlessly', 'spectrum', 'tones', 'madcap', 'poignant', 'romantic', 'subversive', 'likable', 'cast', 'comfy', 'chemistry', 'go-to', 'guy', 'laughs', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'Neil', 'Patrick', 'Harris', 'outrageously', 'weasely', 'character', 'Barney', 'nothing', 'else', 'Barney', 'certainly', 'introduced', 'sitcom', 'lexicon', 'phrases', 'such', 'Suit', 'up', 'Awesome', 'Oh', 'one', 'more', 'help', 'Wayne', 'Brady', 'cameo', 'former', 'Dallas', 'Cowboy', 'running', 'back', 'Emmett', 'Smith', 'HOW', 'MET', 'YOUR', 'MOTHER', 'Season', '2', 'funny', 'warm', 'unpredictable', 'not', 'mention', 'simply', 'legen', 'wait', 'dary']",How I Met Your Mother: Season 2
