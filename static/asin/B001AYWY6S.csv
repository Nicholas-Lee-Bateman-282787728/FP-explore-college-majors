I laughed enough times that I found myself enjoying it, but that doesn't change the fact the storyline definitely has a low budget feel to it.The film definitely contains humor, though I must admit I didn't really catch any of the sexual references that many others apparently have.  If that's the case, yeah, you probably shouldn't let your teens watch this movie.The goofy Italian guy was hilarious most of the time, as was the majority of the little things such as the soccer moms kids letting the family dog eat peanut butter and slobber all over the place, haha.There *is* a positive message about not giving up when it comes to playing the game of soccer poorly.  Gotta give the film a little bit of credit there.  Not the greatest film in the world, but decent enough for a rental.",4,soccer film,1271376000,"04 16, 2010",2010,855,"[""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'think', 'Soccer', 'Mom', 'be', 'totally', 'honest', 'laughed', 'enough', 'times', 'found', 'enjoying', ""n't"", 'change', 'fact', 'storyline', 'definitely', 'low', 'budget', 'feel', 'it.The', 'film', 'definitely', 'humor', 'must', 'admit', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'catch', 'sexual', 'references', 'many', 'others', 'apparently', 'have', 'case', 'yeah', 'probably', 'should', ""n't"", 'let', 'teens', 'watch', 'movie.The', 'goofy', 'Italian', 'guy', 'was', 'hilarious', 'most', 'time', 'was', 'majority', 'little', 'things', 'such', 'soccer', 'moms', 'kids', 'letting', 'family', 'dog', 'eat', 'peanut', 'butter', 'slobber', 'place', 'haha.There', 'positive', 'message', 'not', 'giving', 'up', 'when', 'playing', 'game', 'soccer', 'poorly', 'Got', 'ta', 'give', 'film', 'little', 'bit', 'credit', 'there', 'Not', 'greatest', 'film', 'world', 'decent', 'enough', 'rental']",Soccer Mom
1169020,A2O6K23YDIP81M,B001AYWY6S,"camden0022 ""Amazon Jungle King""","[5, 5]","I rented this movie from RedBox and I couldn't stop lauging as the mom tries to play a popular italian soccer star just to convince the girls soccer team that he is actually coming to coach. She and the soccer star actually got into an altercation at the airport and he blatantly refused to coach the soccer team, but there are some real surprising twists as the movie progreses. I was laughing for more than a full minute on the part where the real ""Lorenzo"" pours a pitcher of water on himself because two other people poured water on him because they thought he couldn't ""make up his mind"" on what to order. The truth of the matter was the mom (Missi Pyle) was impersonating him and they were in the same room!You just need to watch the movie to find out if the mom's (Missi Pyle's) act of playing Lorenzo the Italian soccer star is exposed. Emily Osmont did an excellent job as playing Missi Pyle's daughter and she is very good at playing soccer. I wish I could give this movie 6 stars because of how closely it resembled Mrs. Doubtfire and She's the Man (both excellent movies where people try to impersonate others).I wasn't sure why some people gave it negative reviews based on the sexual dialagoue, but this is a teen movie. What did you expect? But anyway this movie is actually worth buying and keeping as a collector's edition.",5,Similiar to She's the Man and especially Mrs. Doubtfire...,1228867200,"12 10, 2008",2008,1340,"['rented', 'movie', 'RedBox', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'lauging', 'mom', 'play', 'popular', 'italian', 'soccer', 'star', 'just', 'convince', 'girls', 'soccer', 'team', 'actually', 'coming', 'coach', 'soccer', 'star', 'actually', 'got', 'altercation', 'airport', 'blatantly', 'refused', 'coach', 'soccer', 'team', 'are', 'real', 'surprising', 'twists', 'movie', 'was', 'laughing', 'more', 'full', 'minute', 'part', 'where', 'real', 'Lorenzo', 'pitcher', 'water', 'two', 'other', 'people', 'poured', 'water', 'thought', 'could', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'what', 'order', 'truth', 'matter', 'was', 'mom', 'Missi', 'Pyle', 'was', 'impersonating', 'were', 'same', 'room', 'just', 'need', 'watch', 'movie', 'find', 'out', 'mom', 'Missi', 'Pyle', 'act', 'playing', 'Lorenzo', 'Italian', 'soccer', 'star', 'exposed', 'Emily', 'Osmont', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'playing', 'Missi', 'Pyle', 'daughter', 'very', 'good', 'playing', 'soccer', 'wish', 'could', 'give', 'movie', '6', 'stars', 'how', 'closely', 'resembled', 'Mrs.', 'Doubtfire', 'Man', 'excellent', 'movies', 'where', 'people', 'try', 'impersonate', 'others', '.I', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'why', 'people', 'gave', 'negative', 'reviews', 'based', 'sexual', 'dialagoue', 'teen', 'movie', 'What', 'did', 'expect', 'anyway', 'movie', 'actually', 'worth', 'buying', 'keeping', 'collector', 'edition']",Soccer Mom
1169021,AQZH7YTWQPOBE,B001AYWY6S,Enjolras,"[1, 1]","Sometimes corny, generally predictable,Soccer Momis nonetheless a surprisingly entertaining. In a plot twist reminiscent ofTootsie, a suburban soccer mom dresses up as an Italian soccer star to impress her daughter's team. This film isn't flashy and the acting won't leave you floored, but it does the job.I suspect this will be a good movie for older kids/younger teens. I found the complaints about sexual innuendos to be nonsense. The whole point of the plot twist is that the female does not realize she's kissing the mom, but thinks she's kissing a soccer star. It's not a lesbian kiss.",3,Tootsie meets Beckham,1276732800,"06 17, 2010",2010,591,"['Sometimes', 'corny', 'generally', 'predictable', 'Soccer', 'Momis', 'nonetheless', 'surprisingly', 'entertaining', 'plot', 'twist', 'reminiscent', 'ofTootsie', 'suburban', 'soccer', 'mom', 'up', 'Italian', 'soccer', 'star', 'impress', 'daughter', 'team', 'film', ""n't"", 'flashy', 'acting', 'wo', ""n't"", 'leave', 'floored', 'job.I', 'suspect', 'will', 'be', 'good', 'movie', 'older', 'kids/younger', 'teens', 'found', 'complaints', 'sexual', 'innuendos', 'be', 'nonsense', 'whole', 'point', 'plot', 'twist', 'female', 'not', 'realize', 'kissing', 'mom', 'kissing', 'soccer', 'star', 'not', 'lesbian', 'kiss']",Soccer Mom
1169022,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B001AYWY6S,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","For the record, it isn't Missi Pyle's character who says that to her daughter. She and Emily Osment share a different sort of dysfunction.Parents will do the screwiest things for their kids. SOCCER MOM demonstrates this, with Missi Pyle playing a harried mom who masquerades as famous Italian soccer star, Lorenzo Vincenzo, who comes to coach her 14-year-old daughter's hapless soccer team. SOCCER MOM hits its high points whenever the disguise is on and I grinned at all the wacky that went down. Missi Pyle, under all the prosthetic, looks passable as a dude, although she's not as convincing with the posture and the man voice. Still, Missi is so likable that it's easy to overlook those nitpicks. There's just a bit of Lucille Ball in Missi Pyle.It's nice to see Emily Osment temporarily shedding HANNAH MONTANA to do her own thing, to step into the spotlight for once. Emily's angry teen role doesn't lend much room for her comedic talents so she switches it up and demonstrates a nice dramatic presence. It also adds a measure of believability that Osment actually has eight or nine years of soccer-playing experience. Underneath all the silly stuff, the core beat concerns the strained relationship between a mom and a daughter grieving over the loss of her father, and the mom's desperate attempt to reconnect. It all adds up to a warm-hearted family flick with bits of good old-fashioned silly cross-dressing thrown in. The soccer sequences won't light up any soccer fan, but that's not the point, anyway. The screwball's the thing, and how ridiculous it really gets when the real (and blustery) Lorenzo Vincenzo shows up at the regional finals. But we all knew that wasn't not gonna happen.The DVD's bonus stuff: ""Heart of Goal"" features interviews with cast members Missy Pyle, Emily Osment, and Dan Cortese (00:07:48 minutes); ""From Mom To Man"" reveals the arduous process which transforms Missy Pyle into Lorenzo Vincenzo (00:06:27); and the movie trailer.",4,"""Oh, and darling, if we lose today, you're still my daughter.

The white man was a perfect father and husband2. ONLY reason a white mother could ever be single is because her husband died.3. White mom is a good mother b/c she runs herself ragged trying to please her spoiled teenager4. Black couple is divorced (at least they were married in this one)5. Black female is angry/bitter at her ex-man6. Black man is a jerk and poor excuse for a father.7. There were more gay male hairdressers than female hairdressers working in that salon.How many of these movies are out there?

1169024,A3RLP7U4RUT6R2,B001AYWY6S,Jerry,"[0, 0]","My 11 year old (soccer playing) daugter picked this out at the video store completely at random.  Knowing nothing about the film, I really enjoyed the story-line and unlike many of the other reviewers, I am not going to disclose what it is.  While the plot is far from original, my daughter and I had a very good time watching it together.  If you are a soccer mom (or dad) this one is a no-brainer.  It is filled with light-hearted humor, and the main plot twist is quite entertaining.  Missi Pyle does a fun performance and you will see Emily Osment nicely pull off a role that is far from her character in Hannah Montana.Regarding the remarks that some have made about sexual content, they do have some merit.  While I don't think that it had a big impact on the movie as a whole, there was one scene where both me and my daughter looked away from the screen as if to say, ""That's just gross!""Bottom line: This is a fun picture to watch with a soccer kid!",4,READ THIS REVIEW - NO SPOILER HERE!,1232928000,"01 26, 2009",2009,958,"['11', 'year', 'old', 'soccer', 'playing', 'daugter', 'picked', 'out', 'video', 'store', 'completely', 'random', 'Knowing', 'nothing', 'film', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'story-line', 'many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'disclose', 'what', 'plot', 'far', 'original', 'daughter', 'had', 'very', 'good', 'time', 'watching', 'together', 'are', 'soccer', 'mom', 'dad', 'one', 'no-brainer', 'filled', 'light-hearted', 'humor', 'main', 'plot', 'twist', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'Missi', 'Pyle', 'fun', 'performance', 'will', 'see', 'Emily', 'Osment', 'nicely', 'pull', 'off', 'role', 'far', 'character', 'Hannah', 'Montana.Regarding', 'remarks', 'have', 'made', 'sexual', 'content', 'do', 'have', 'merit', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'had', 'big', 'impact', 'movie', 'whole', 'was', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'daughter', 'looked', 'away', 'screen', 'say', 'just', 'gross', 'Bottom', 'line', 'fun', 'picture', 'watch', 'soccer', 'kid']",Soccer Mom
