1021465,AQQFI7YHMRL7S,B000IOM0S8,James Morris,"[5, 7]","Musical revues can be quite tricky.  When a show celebrates the talents of a particular composer, having the material performed out of context is usually not a problem for the works of lesser composers.  But in the case of Stephen Sondheim, it is very hard to appreciate the full force of his amazingly deft and intelligent lyrics (not to mention his subtle melodies) when the individual pieces are removed from the show for which they were written.  I have seen, or at least heard, many, many musical revues of Mr. Sondheim's works.  Sometimes they succeed brilliantly, but because of the high caliber of the material and intellectual connection with the source work, the producer and director of any musical revue of Sondheim must be very cautious.  For these reasons, among others, I did not find this production of Putting It Together to be as completely satisfying as it should have been.  And, as a Sondheim ""purist"", the first strike against this production was the fact that some of the lyrics were changed, which is always guaranteed to get me off on the wrong foot, at least, when dealing with Sondheim.It has long been my considered opinion that, artistically, Mr. Sondheim can do no wrong.  At his worst (if such a word could ever be applied to his output) he writes circles around every other Broadway composer of the 20th century.  But, out of context, his material does not always come across, particularly his later works, which almost always require the accompaniment of the various subtle melodies that he intricately weaves throughout the course of any one show.  Combining material from more than one Sondheim effort is risky, as his ""voice"" is never the same in any two successive theatre pieces, let alone five or ten.  This is the true mark of a genius; the Grand Guignol atmosphere of Sweeney Todd cannot be expected to mix easily with the delicate waltzes of A Little Night Music, let alone the broad slapstick of Forum, the ""70's Mod feel"" of Company, the serious celebration of the artistic process that is Sunday In the Park With George, or the heartbreaking, stark nostalgia of Follies.  From the tricky lyrics of West Side Story, through the folly of Anyone Can Whistle and right up through the achingly beautiful prose of Passion, it is best to experience Sondheim in the context of a complete piece.  Not that it can't be done, mind you, but it is oh so tricky an undertaking to mix his bananas with his grapefruit.The cast of this show are consummate professionals all, who, for the most part, are up to the task of interpreting Sondheim as he should be: minimally.  Any amount of over dramatization or gesticulation in a Sondheim number will ruin it - his words are simply too powerful, too potent and too direct.  I steadfastly believe that, in order to present Sondheim correctly, all any actor need do is simply sing his words.  They take care of themselves, thank you, and do not require the slightest embellishment to maintain their brilliance.  Exquisite diamonds rarely require magnifying glasses.One of the problems, for me, is the tendency in musical revues to rely heavily on material that was cut from completed works.  Whole evenings have been structured around Sondheim's ""rejects"".  There are those who insist, and not without some merit, that the songs that Sondheim discards on his way to a finished piece are frequently superior to the final product proffered by certain other composers.  True to a point, but I always like to think that there is a reason why songs are cut, and it's not always just because they don't quite fit.  For example, there are those who think that the song, Happily Ever After, which was replaced by Being Alive in Company, is just as good as the final choice.  I don't agree.  Nevertheless, I don't object to a certain amount of ""cut"" songs in a Sondheim review, as long as they don't overpower the real stuff.  After all, the finished scores for Follies, Sweeney Todd and Company alone could yield enough songs for a full evening's entertainment.  Why do we need to ""celebrate"" Mr. Sondheim's rejects?As for the performers here, let's start with George Hearn, who is easily one of the most successful interpreters of Sondheim to come along in the past 25 years.  After replacing Len Cariou in the role of Benjamin Barker, Mr. Hearn so completely placed his stamp on the character of Sweeney Todd that many people erroneously believe him to have originated the role.  Of course, there was nothing wrong with Mr. Cariou's performance, but Mr. Hearn established himself as the definitive Barker / Todd through the wonderful PBS production and subsequent DVD that was released several years ago.  Here, as always, he often speaks as much as he sings, but there is an underlying comprehension and simplicity to his presentation that other actor / singers frequently fail to realize while performing Sondheim.  His comfort level with the song, The Road You Didn't Take, from Follies, is such that you want to see him tackle the role of Ben, and his simple and poignant understating of Old Friends is no less skillful than his marvelously dry, deliciously comic reading of Have I Got A Girl For You.As for the rest of the cast, well, Bronson Pinchot was a revelation.  His perfect rendition of Buddy's Blues was the best I've seen since the original production of Follies closed in 1971.  I saw that show three times during its original Broadway run, and I never expect to see the like of it again.  Mr. Pinchot is in perfect character for every number assigned here, and he is truly a joy to behold.  Just as able throughout were the performances of Ruthie Henshall and John Barrowman; Mr. Barrowman in particular sang with a sweet, clear voice, and he presented himself as sophisticated, handsome and poised throughout the evening.This brings me to the performer that impressed me least - Carol Burnett.  Throughout the 1960's and early 1970's, I was a great fan of her hilarious slapstick antics, as presented on her television show.  I have also been aware for years of her fascination with Sondheim, but I just don't think that she has what it takes to do him justice.  I saw her perform The Ladies Who Lunch on her variety show in the early 1970's - it left me cold then, and her rendition of it has not change one bit.  She simply tries too hard to put it over, when all it needs is to be presented.  Her performance of the biting, satiric classic, Could I Leave You, is even worse.  Once again, her overreaching chews up the scenery completely, without managing to milk a single laugh from one of the great comedic songs of Mr. Sondheim's output!  I will say that she succeeds a bit more with Getting Married Today, although she admits in the interview segment that she slowed it down.  Of course, part of the charm of the original was the manic pace that Beth Howland brought to the song, and admittedly, the breakneck speed of the original would prove difficult for all but the most highly-skilled vocalist to match, let alone a woman of Miss Burnett's maturity.  Carol Burnett's duet with Ruthie Henshall, Always A Woman, a wonderful song cut from Anyone Can Whistle, was quite funny, but with material like this it's hard not to be funny.  Miss Burnett came across best for me on her rendition of Everybody Ought To Have A Maid, even though she destroyed the melody.Finally, to read some of the reviews here, you would think that Carol Burnett's ""blooper"", which appears as a DVD bonus, was the funniest thing ever filmed before a camera.  Sorry.  This is Sondheim - the wit of his glorious lyrics should be the focus and main source of the laughs here, and I frankly don't believe that whoopee-cushion humor mixes at all well with the sophistication of Mr. Sondheim's wit.Nevertheless, I give the production four stars, mainly for the material and George Hearn.

1021466,A9TG2NFA614S9,B000IOM0S8,John F. Rooney,"[1, 1]","""Putting it Together"" (2002) is a very entertaining, fast-moving musical review with five talented performers, innovative staging and, of course, the great music of Stephen Sondheim. Carol Burnett proves again her talents as a gifted singer who can belt them out like Ethel Merman and is a hilarious clown. George Hearn's voice is outstanding, and the chemistry and the character by-play that he and Burnett develop is an extraordinary achievement.Bronson Pinchot adds his comic talents to the proceedings and throughout introduces one-word themes to the show like ""Revenge"", ""Competition"", ""Seduction"", etcetera, which gives the show a plot line. Rounding out the five are Ruthie Henshall and John Barrowman who play the good-looking romantic team.The music at the beginning seems unfamiliar, and the way the Sondheim songs are seamlessly integrated is another fine achievement. Sondheim wrote a few movie scores such as one for ""Dick Tracy"". In this review there are 35 musical selections.It was taped before a live audience in the Biltmore Theater in New York. You're going to recognize the music from various Sondheim shows, but here they're given a new twist. The title ""Putting It Together"" is taken from ""Sunday in the Park with George"". As far as I can tell there is no CD of this particular review, although there is a CD for the 1993 version of the show starring Julie Andrews.The show demonstrates the amazing versatility of Sondheim and the way he dabbled in various modes. The lyrics to the songs show the brilliance, the wit, and the creativity of the composer/lyricist.Burnett does a fine version of ""Here's to the Ladies Who Lunch"". At the end the ensemble does a great job with ""Being Alive"" and ""Old Friends"".There's some extra material on this DVD which is very good. There's a blooper, a show-stopper, when Carol's skirt starts falling off. The interview with her is very good. She started in ""Once Upon a Mattress."" She says that most Sondheim songs are like three-act plays and often have a twist ending.",5,Sondheim's Music and a Talented Cast of Five,1286582400,"10 9, 2010",2010,2026,"['Putting', 'Together', '2002', 'very', 'entertaining', 'fast-moving', 'musical', 'review', 'five', 'talented', 'performers', 'innovative', 'staging', 'course', 'great', 'music', 'Stephen', 'Sondheim', 'Carol', 'Burnett', 'again', 'talents', 'gifted', 'singer', 'who', 'can', 'belt', 'out', 'Ethel', 'Merman', 'hilarious', 'clown', 'George', 'Hearn', 'voice', 'outstanding', 'chemistry', 'character', 'by-play', 'Burnett', 'develop', 'extraordinary', 'achievement.Bronson', 'Pinchot', 'comic', 'talents', 'proceedings', 'introduces', 'one-word', 'themes', 'show', 'Revenge', 'Competition', 'Seduction', 'etcetera', 'show', 'plot', 'line', 'Rounding', 'out', 'five', 'are', 'Ruthie', 'Henshall', 'John', 'Barrowman', 'who', 'play', 'good-looking', 'romantic', 'team.The', 'music', 'beginning', 'unfamiliar', 'way', 'Sondheim', 'songs', 'are', 'seamlessly', 'integrated', 'fine', 'achievement', 'Sondheim', 'wrote', 'few', 'movie', 'scores', 'such', 'one', 'Dick', 'Tracy', 'review', 'are', '35', 'musical', 'selections.It', 'was', 'taped', 'live', 'audience', 'Biltmore', 'Theater', 'New', 'York', ""'re"", 'going', 'recognize', 'music', 'various', 'Sondheim', 'shows', 'here', ""'re"", 'given', 'new', 'twist', 'title', 'Putting', 'Together', 'taken', 'Sunday', 'Park', 'George', 'As', 'far', 'can', 'tell', 'CD', 'particular', 'review', 'CD', '1993', 'version', 'show', 'starring', 'Julie', 'Andrews.The', 'show', 'amazing', 'versatility', 'Sondheim', 'way', 'dabbled', 'various', 'modes', 'lyrics', 'songs', 'show', 'brilliance', 'wit', 'creativity', 'composer/lyricist.Burnett', 'fine', 'version', 'Here', 'Ladies', 'Who', 'Lunch', 'end', 'ensemble', 'great', 'job', 'Being', 'Alive', 'Old', 'Friends', 'extra', 'material', 'DVD', 'very', 'good', 'blooper', 'show-stopper', 'when', 'Carol', 'skirt', 'falling', 'off', 'interview', 'very', 'good', 'started', 'Once', 'Mattress', 'most', 'Sondheim', 'songs', 'are', 'three-act', 'plays', 'often', 'have', 'twist', 'ending']",N/A
