Although I do agree somewhat with previously written reviews regarding the characters of Captain Awesome and Ellie, the growth in Chuck and Sarah's story lines was a ray of hope that Season 4 will finally be a complete season for all characters involved.

I also really like the direction that the plot goes, and found myself hooked and anticipating the next episode.

1299485,A1CQGAPQMN41LV,B002ZCY7PU,"A. Whitehead ""Werthead""","[0, 1]","Charles 'Chuck' Bartowski and his handlers, Sarah Walker and John Casey, have successfully defeated FULCRUM, a rogue intelligence agency. The Intersect, the combined intelligence database of the entire United States which has been downloaded into Chuck's brain, has been radically upgraded. Now Chuck has access to advanced weapons and kung fu skills, amongst other abilities. But Chuck's emotions are getting in the way of him being able to do his job. A new agent, Daniel Shaw, is assigned to the team to help train Chuck as a spy, but this has unexpected results.After the relentlessly entertaining second season of Chuck, the third season gets off to a surprisingly weak start. Rather than picking up immediately on Season 2's cliffhanger ending (where Chuck comes into possession of the Intersect 2.0), we rejoin the action six months later. This causes problems even with Chuck's elastic notions of plausibility (why are Sarah and Casey hanging around Burbank for six months when Chuck isn't there?) and necessitates a lot of backtracking and flashbacks to fill in the gap. Once we're past the hurdle of the first few episodes (and a somewhat dubious Vinnie Jones guest role), however, things improve a lot. The second season's format of stringing together several multi-episode arcs into one cohesive whole is repeated and is almost as successful as previously. Brandon Routh is decent in the new role of Shaw, with the writers not wasting any opportunity to highlight his previous major role as Superman (even draping him in the American flag in one amusing scene).As usual, the season has a good mix of comedy and drama, with some great stand-alone stories (Armand Assante's turn as a somewhat demented, American-friendly version of Castro is especially entertaining) standing alongside the ongoing story arcs. Most satisfying is the unexpected way the show's set-up suddenly changes. Major characters discover Chuck's secret with little forewarning, altering the show's premise for the better by dropping the 'secret identity' storyline just as it was starting to get a little stale. Chuck and Sarah's relationship is moved onto another level, again just as the 'will they/won't they' angle was running out of steam. Even Casey is given a stronger personal storyline, as he discovers a family he never knew he had and becomes conflicted over contacting them or not. And, as usual, the more serious spy stuff is balanced out nicely by the lunacy going on over at the Buy More store.Overall, the third season of Chuck (****) is funny, self-aware and entertaining. It's not quite as a good as the second season, due to a dodgy set-up in the first few episodes that results in a lot of backtracking and wheel-spinning and the fact that the new bad guys, the Ring, are identical to FULCRUM. Beyond that, the show evolves its premise and characters in compelling new directions and shows a willingness to change even fundamental parts of the premise when necessary. The season is available now in the UK (DVD) and USA (DVD, Blu-Ray).",4,A solidly entertaining season.,1334793600,"04 19, 2012",2012,3037,"['Charles', ""'Chuck"", 'Bartowski', 'handlers', 'Sarah', 'Walker', 'John', 'Casey', 'have', 'successfully', 'defeated', 'FULCRUM', 'rogue', 'intelligence', 'agency', 'Intersect', 'combined', 'intelligence', 'database', 'entire', 'United', 'States', 'been', 'downloaded', 'Chuck', 'brain', 'been', 'radically', 'upgraded', 'Now', 'Chuck', 'access', 'advanced', 'weapons', 'kung', 'fu', 'skills', 'other', 'abilities', 'Chuck', 'emotions', 'are', 'getting', 'way', 'being', 'able', 'do', 'job', 'new', 'agent', 'Daniel', 'Shaw', 'assigned', 'team', 'help', 'train', 'Chuck', 'spy', 'unexpected', 'results.After', 'relentlessly', 'entertaining', 'second', 'season', 'Chuck', 'third', 'season', 'off', 'surprisingly', 'weak', 'start', 'Rather', 'picking', 'up', 'immediately', 'Season', '2', 'cliffhanger', 'ending', 'where', 'Chuck', 'possession', 'Intersect', '2.0', 'rejoin', 'action', 'six', 'months', 'later', 'problems', 'even', 'Chuck', 'elastic', 'notions', 'plausibility', 'why', 'are', 'Sarah', 'Casey', 'hanging', 'around', 'Burbank', 'six', 'months', 'when', 'Chuck', ""n't"", 'there', 'lot', 'backtracking', 'flashbacks', 'fill', 'gap', ""'re"", 'hurdle', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'somewhat', 'dubious', 'Vinnie', 'Jones', 'guest', 'role', 'however', 'things', 'improve', 'lot', 'second', 'season', 'format', 'stringing', 'together', 'several', 'multi-episode', 'arcs', 'one', 'cohesive', 'whole', 'repeated', 'almost', 'as', 'successful', 'previously', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'decent', 'new', 'role', 'Shaw', 'writers', 'not', 'wasting', 'opportunity', 'highlight', 'previous', 'major', 'role', 'Superman', 'even', 'draping', 'American', 'flag', 'one', 'amusing', 'scene', 'usual', 'season', 'good', 'mix', 'comedy', 'drama', 'great', 'stand-alone', 'stories', 'Armand', 'Assante', 'turn', 'somewhat', 'demented', 'American-friendly', 'version', 'Castro', 'especially', 'entertaining', 'standing', 'ongoing', 'story', 'arcs', 'Most', 'satisfying', 'unexpected', 'way', 'show', 'set-up', 'suddenly', 'changes', 'Major', 'characters', 'discover', 'Chuck', 'secret', 'little', 'forewarning', 'altering', 'show', 'premise', 'better', 'dropping', ""'secret"", 'identity', 'storyline', 'just', 'was', 'starting', 'get', 'little', 'stale', 'Chuck', 'Sarah', 'relationship', 'moved', 'level', 'again', 'just', ""'will"", 'they/wo', ""n't"", 'angle', 'was', 'running', 'out', 'steam', 'Even', 'Casey', 'given', 'stronger', 'personal', 'storyline', 'family', 'never', 'knew', 'had', 'becomes', 'conflicted', 'over', 'contacting', 'not', 'usual', 'more', 'serious', 'spy', 'stuff', 'balanced', 'out', 'nicely', 'lunacy', 'going', 'Buy', 'More', 'store.Overall', 'third', 'season', 'Chuck', '****', 'funny', 'self-aware', 'entertaining', 'not', 'quite', 'good', 'second', 'season', 'due', 'dodgy', 'set-up', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'results', 'lot', 'backtracking', 'wheel-spinning', 'fact', 'new', 'bad', 'guys', 'Ring', 'are', 'identical', 'FULCRUM', 'Beyond', 'show', 'premise', 'characters', 'compelling', 'new', 'directions', 'willingness', 'change', 'even', 'fundamental', 'parts', 'premise', 'when', 'necessary', 'season', 'available', 'now', 'UK', 'DVD', 'USA', 'DVD', 'Blu-Ray']",N/A

At Season Two's end, nice guy computer nerd and CIA asset Chuck Bartowski (Zachary Levi) uploaded into his own brain a new, improved Intersect which not only restored his ability to ""flash"" on espionage information, it also provided access to new skills.  As he told his CIA handler Sara Walker (Yvonne Strahovski) and her NSA partner John Casey (Adam Baldwin) at the time, ""Guys, I know Kung Fu.""In Season Three, Chuck, no longer an accidental tourist in the espionage world, embarks on a bumpy, uncertain journey to becoming a full-fledged spy.  This journey involves a painful Catch-22.  Chuck must succeed in becoming a spy to stay close to Sara Walker, his erstwhile bodyguard and romantic interest, but each step towards spyhood seems to take him further away from the decent, honest guy that Sara secretly cherishes.At the beginning of Season Three, Chuck makes two critical mistakes: He disappoints Sara and he flunks spy school.  In search of second chances, Chuck must accept tutoring from the experienced, ruthless CIA agent Daniel Shaw (Brandon Routh in an extended guest role), a man with questionable intentions toward both Chuck and Sara.  Chuck will also suffer hilarious difficulties in keeping his real and spy lives separate.  New brother-in-law ""Captain Awesome"", best friend Morgan, and Chuck's co-workers at the BuyMore become entangled in spy plots, while Team Bartokowski members Sara Walker and John Casey experience some surprising personal and professional challenges.Season Three was originally programmed for thirteen episodes before being extended to nineteen.

Too many times, an excellent series has been axed because of ratings, demographics, etc.The third season takes the viewer to a different level as Chuck becomes a full blown spy.  Criticism aside, this season brought out more of the personal storylines of the characters.In Chuck VS. The Tic Tac, John Casey's history is presented with a few surprises tossed into the plot.  It is one of the best episodes of the series.Chuck Vs. First Class: on his way to Paris Chuck meets Hannah (Kristin Kreuk).  For the next several episodes Chuck attempts to forget Sarah with his attention on Hannah, but alas, Chuck has to face his true feelings for Sarah, and unfortunately, Hannah is left betrayed and feeling used by Chuck.  This was not Chuck's best moment--his nice guy image took a beating.  Blame the writers for this mess.Awesome and Ellie are given more to do in this season.  The Buy More gang have their moments as well, especially in Chuck Vs. The Beard--great episode, and their greatest moments in the season finale--Chuck VS. The Ring!Super Agent Daniel Shaw is tossed into this seasonal bag with some mixed reviews.  Sarah changing her romantic focus from Chuck to Shaw was a bit lame.  Sorry.  Of course, everything works out for Chuck and Sarah as the season progressed as we knew it would--romantic destiny is difficult to alter.Shaw and Chuck have their moments.  The confrontations led up to a great climax, more than once.In the final two episodes-- Chuck VS. The Subway and Chuck VS. The Ring, there are twists and turns, surprises and an ultimate showdown between the Ring and Chuck's Gang.

1299502,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B002ZCY7PU,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 2]","There's a bit, just a tiny bit, of a backlash with the decision to allow Chuck Bartowski to actually whup some asss. There's some feeling that Chuck should've stayed the lovable klutzy wuss who contributes solely thru his smarts and his Intersect intel flashes. But these are observations offered by friends of mine who are sort of lame. Me, I love it that now villains truly cannot front on Chuck, that Chuck - providing his emotions don't hinder his upgrade (the Intersect II) from lending him, say, martial arts skills - now can take on the most formidable cats in a life-or-death rumble. The direct fallout, of course, is that his handlers are given less chances to spring into action. That was one thing I was bemoaning, that the lovely Agent Walker wasn't given more to do in the way of buttkicking. However, emotionally, romantically, Sarah Walker's plate is pretty full. She and Chuck once again put you on a stressful emotional roller coaster.Writers have to keep finding ways to keep Chuck and Sarah apart, of course, even though we already know that these two truly care for each other. Theoretically, the Intersect II makes Chuck into the perfect spy, our Nerd Herder now able to access pretty much whichever skills set he requires to fulfill his missions. What hinders him isn't only his forays into immaturity but his inherent humanity, his inability to kill, although Sarah considers this to be Chuck's greatest asset. There's a swerve thrown in which kicks off this third season. Chuck with his new abilities now intends to be the best spy he can be, to the extent that several months ago he'd dismissed Sarah's plea that they quit the skullduggery business and go away together. As the first episode opens, we learn that Chuck and Sarah have been estranged since then. And because this alone apparently isn't enough to mess up the viewer's day, Kristin Kreuk and Brandon Routh are ushered in with recurring roles, serving as the respective romantic foils and further obstacles to Chuck and Sarah's getting together. At least, Brandon Routh - as Agent Shaw, the new team leader of Project Bartowski - also advances the overarching plot. As if Chuck's shot at landing Sarah weren't dire enough, now he's got Superman as a rival. Damn writers.Putting aside the ongoing romantic tug of war, one really fun element is Chuck's new ability to access a whole mess of skills sets. Besides watching Chuck throw down with the kung fu and the gymnastics, we also see him do things like play the flamenco guitar, speak Korean, even dance elegantly. All these borrowed talents (except maybe the speaking Korean part) come in really handy with the black ops missions because Operation Bartowski is kept busy foiling those nasty plots hatched by the Ring, a secret criminal cabal which, by the way, encompasses the Fulcrum group (Fulcrum being the Big Bad of the prior two seasons).CHUCK blankets a heap of genres, it's what makes the show so great. The unrequited romance, the sweet espionage thriller, the awesome geek comedy. The spy stuff is always offset by the odd and kinda creepy Nerd Herders and their prankings at the Buy More store. I get a kick out of the rock band wannabe, Jeffster.Faithful viewers who'd been pining and moping for the past two seasons are in for some really gratifying moments. Chuck can't be expected to keep his secrets from those closest to him, not when there's so much cloak & dagger traffic going on at the Buy More and the yogurt place and around his apartment complex. So, yeah, events unfold and result in irrevocable shifts in the status quo and in the character dynamics. Season 3 delivers with a plentitude of fan joy. There's even a chance that love conquers all. This cast only gets better. I seriously don't even want to single out any one actor because every one is so very on point. The Awesomes are given larger roles to play. Morgan Grimes becomes more likable. We learn Sarah Walker's real first name. I love what's done to make John Casey more human, or as human as the supremely bottled-up NSA Colonel can get. All hail Adam Baldwin (okay, dude is an icon; I must single him out). And, dammit, okay, I have to applaud Zachary Levi on his physicality because the man absolutely sells his action scenes. Zachary Levi, stand up. Or, put another way, up Chuck!There originally were only thirteen episodes slated for Season 3, but then six more were ordered. These nineteen episodes are caught on 5 discs, with the following special features: ""Chuck-Fu and Dim Sum"" - an overview of Season 3 (00:21:51 minutes long); the video mockumentary ""The Jeffster Revolution"" (00:10:54 minutes); 6 minutes' worth of outtakes; and tons of ""Declassified Scenes"" which are basically bonus scenes spread throughout the five discs.",5,"""Sarah Walker, do you agree

Shaw is an issue during the ENTIRE season all the way through, Scott Baccula's character of Chuck's dad (he did an excellent job too as always) leaves the biggest mystery in the end of the finale and his character ends up giving you a ""JOLT"" with what he goes through and unleashes upon Chuck.  Chuck must step up to the plate to protect his loved ones and do something deeper in the very end as he also progresses through the series and as far as protecting family, ironically so does John Casey (Adam Baldwin).

The first season is wholesome and funny with a little bit of mystery and romance thrown in. The extended cast is well thought out and are important to the series unlike many other shows I can think of. I appreciate that the first season can be viewed by the whole family without worry of morals or language. Unfortunately as season two progresses into season three the writers went down another path and made the show too grown up for the kids with the budding relationship between the shows' two primary stars. Seasons one and two are must-sees by the whole family but I would hold off season three and beyond for mature audiences only.Season three finds Chuck as a first-class spy who is finally getting a grip on his alter-ego and how to deal with it. He is thrust into a lot of adventure and a bit of intrigue with and without his spy girlfriend. It sometimes feels like I am watching a Victoria's Secret shoot when she is in the room, which is totally unnecessary for the show to succeed.

With those skills he can now be the spy he's always wanted. Though as you could expect the journey to super spy is not without some bumps as he has trouble flashing because his emotions get in the way. Because of this Morgan is finally brought into the loop and is hilarious in almost every scene he is in. Morgan is even more of a geek then Chuck was and seeing Morgan try to help the team is super funny. Also it's nice to see him and Chuck bond again as they can finally discuss everything once again.Morgan isn't the only one to join the team this season. Special Agent Daniel Shaw joins the team. He is the real spy that Chuck wants to become. He creates a love triangle with Chuck and Sarah that pushes all of the characters forward as each shows their love for one another in different ways. Chuck is more of the sweet guy and Shaw is the suave Bond type. They each battle for Sarah's love and it creates some great story lines. Casey also grows throughout the season as you find out that he has a family. It makes him so much more human as he shows his love to a family that doesn't know he exists.The main storyline throughout the season is the battle against the Ring and there infiltration of the US government. It has a lot of twists and turns and it really pushes Chuck's spy training along as every week he becomes more of a true spy. It's really exciting to see Chuck evolve into the Spy that he's always wanted to be. Also before the season concludes Scott Bakula returns to try and save Chuck from an overloading Intersect. Also Christopher Lloyd guest stars as Chuck's therapist. He isn't his normal jovial self in the role he plays it much more seriously which is a nice switch up for him.Overall the season is exciting and thoroughly enjoyable every step of the way. You get a lot of twists and turns while still getting the comedy and charm you expect from the series. This season is a step in a new direction for the show. It begins the journey of Chuck actually becoming a spy. It changes up the formula enough to keep the series fresh without varying too much from the nerd/spy/comedy show that we all fell in love with.,5,Nerd vs. Spy,1298073600,"02 19, 2011",2011,2251,"['end', 'season', '2', 'Chuck', 'downloaded', 'Intersect', '2.0', 'head', 'gained', 'serious', 'skills', 'skills', 'can', 'now', 'be', 'spy', 'always', 'wanted', 'could', 'expect', 'journey', 'super', 'spy', 'not', 'bumps', 'trouble', 'flashing', 'emotions', 'get', 'way', 'Morgan', 'finally', 'brought', 'loop', 'hilarious', 'almost', 'scene', 'Morgan', 'even', 'more', 'geek', 'then', 'Chuck', 'was', 'seeing', 'Morgan', 'try', 'help', 'team', 'super', 'funny', 'Also', 'nice', 'see', 'Chuck', 'bond', 'again', 'can', 'finally', 'discuss', 'everything', 'once', 'again.Morgan', ""n't"", 'only', 'one', 'join', 'team', 'season', 'Special', 'Agent', 'Daniel', 'Shaw', 'team', 'real', 'spy', 'Chuck', 'become', 'love', 'triangle', 'Chuck', 'Sarah', 'characters', 'forward', 'love', 'one', 'different', 'ways', 'Chuck', 'more', 'sweet', 'guy', 'Shaw', 'suave', 'Bond', 'type', 'battle', 'Sarah', 'love', 'great', 'story', 'lines', 'Casey', 'also', 'season', 'find', 'out', 'family', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'human', 'love', 'family', ""n't"", 'know', 'exists.The', 'main', 'storyline', 'season', 'battle', 'Ring', 'infiltration', 'US', 'government', 'lot', 'twists', 'turns', 'really', 'Chuck', 'spy', 'training', 'along', 'as', 'week', 'more', 'true', 'spy', 'really', 'exciting', 'see', 'Chuck', 'evolve', 'Spy', 'always', 'wanted', 'be', 'Also', 'season', 'Scott', 'Bakula', 'try', 'save', 'Chuck', 'overloading', 'Intersect', 'Also', 'Christopher', 'Lloyd', 'guest', 'stars', 'Chuck', 'therapist', ""n't"", 'normal', 'jovial', 'self', 'role', 'much', 'more', 'seriously', 'nice', 'switch', 'up', 'season', 'exciting', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'step', 'way', 'get', 'lot', 'twists', 'turns', 'still', 'getting', 'comedy', 'charm', 'expect', 'series', 'season', 'step', 'new', 'direction', 'show', 'journey', 'Chuck', 'actually', 'becoming', 'spy', 'up', 'formula', 'enough', 'keep', 'series', 'fresh', 'varying', 'too', 'much', 'nerd/spy/comedy', 'show', 'fell', 'love']",N/A
