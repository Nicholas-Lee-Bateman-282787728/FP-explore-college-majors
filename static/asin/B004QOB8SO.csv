From The Strand stories by Arthur Conan Doyle, to silent movies, to the Basil era, to John Gielgud's radio programs, even the re-imagining of the genre from Hollywoods' big machine with Robert Downey Jr, each with it's own charm, but we do enjoy this series immensely!These shows are wonderfully imagined, with intelligent scripts, superb acting and a lovely twist incorporating your old favorite stories into modern themes and times.  We couldn't be more pleased, one that Sherlock has truly withstood the test of time and just keeps getting more famous with each passing era, bringing new fans into his world and mind, and two, that this show does not play down to it's audience, but brings you with Sherlock and his clues into deducing all, with a quick wit and a sharp tongue.Truly, a well worth your while and extremely brilliant series, which we hope continues for many more seasons!

Bursaw,"[2, 2]","I recommend buying Sherlock on Blu Ray because quite frankly, the way the visuals are in the show to tell the story, you only cheat yourself on the quality of going DVD. That is, if you have a 1080p HDTV to go with that Blu Ray player. The acting and the story is one thing, but the way the show is crafted, the direction and vision and the different tones and hues of the scenes from the show stand out in HD. If you are in the US watching the second season via Masterpiece on PBS, you arent seeing the entire episodes! They cut 8 minutes out of each show to make room for commericals and to thank funding partners. Its just another reason to watch the second season all over again!And enough about how good it looks on a HDTV screen, did I mention that this version of the modern day sherlock Holmes would probably make Conan Doyle proud?

1424999,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B004QOB8SO,Acute Observer,"[20, 244]","Sherlock Season Two, 2011 filmWriters with lesser talents shouldn't try to modify these classic stories about the beginnings of criminalistics. Part of the appeal of the original classic stories is their world that is just before modern technology. Horse-drawn transport and steam locomotives, a world lit by fire (candles and gas lamps), no telephone or electricity, etc. make these stories a travelogue into the past. Even fingerprints or ballistics are not in use! These stories seem to have been written by someone with an artificially enhanced imagination.""A Scandal in Belgravia"" begins by an immense swimming pool. There is a meeting between Sherlock and Moriarity; the latter walks away. [The opening scenes jump around.] Updating these classic stories takes away from the appeal of the originals. Sherlock uses the Internet to inspect a crime scene. [Besides looking silly, is that legally and scientifically sound?] We hear the name of Irene Adler and what she does for a living. Sherlock uses a ruse to get into her house. Irene is not surprised by this. Three armed men enter this room to rob the safe, but find what they don't want. There is action. [Is this confusing?] They communicate with cell phones. Sherlock recognizes a body from the neck down. Watson is lured away and gets a surprise! The story continues with intruders in Sherlock's rooms. They leave. The woman returns to hide in Sherlock's rooms. [Who wrote this confusing story?] Is this story designed to disgust the viewers? ""Nicely played."" Sherlock figures out the combination to that cell phone so he can get its information. Irene no longer has her protection. But she will be safe. Or will she? ""What shall we tell Sherlock?"" A witness protection program? ""Goodbye, Mr. Holmes."" Can there be another ending? Are they playing with their viewers? Or being deliberately stupid? Its like a comic cartoon.""The Hounds of Baskerville"" begins with a young boy running at night. A nightmare? Sherlock Holmes is nervous and edgy, like from a physical ailment. Then he gets a case, a man's father was killed by a big black dog! A government experiment gone wrong? [No mention of private experiments!] Sherlock observes his client. [His ""bedside manner"" needs improvement.] They go to Dartmoor and learn about local beliefs and the hound. One man made a plaster cast of a dog's paw print. They tour a Top Secret government post. ""Blue Bell""? [Is this padding?] They go out on the moor at night. [Unarmed?] They hear a strange noise. ""A gigantic hound""? Sherlock notices a couple at the inn. Events continue. Will they make sense? Did a local businessman create a stunt with a big dog to attract tourists? Watson explores the laboratory by himself for scary events. Did he see what he expected to see? There are scenes that suggest hallucinations. A secret project? There is a call about Henry. Where is he? Can he remember what really happened twenty years ago? Sherlock explains the effects of fear and stimulus. Shots are fired! The old murder is solved! [Do you find any of this credible?] There are more explanations about the laboratory.What a horrible pile of scrap! The original ""Hound of the Baskervilles"" was a subtle criticism of a hereditary aristocracy that used a clever attempt at murder. Its background told of life in the late 19th century in a small rural village. What is the value of this movie? Can't the writers create their own drama instead of modifying a classic story to create a counterfeit? Do they need to stop smoking?""The Reichenbach Falls"" begins with a meeting between Dr. Watson and his psychiatrist. Sherlock is dead! The story begins with the return of a kidnapped banker to his family. Sherlock welcomes publicity! Tourists visit the Tower of London. They are scanned by machines. There is a break-in where the Crown Jewels are kept. The police find an intruder on the throne. ""Get Sherlock!"" Sherlock meets a woman reporter in the men's room and diagnoses her condition. Sherlock corrects a lawyer as to the law. He diagnoses the jury! ""Don't get clever"" advises Watson. Moriarity chews gum. The jury says ""not guilty"". [A comedy?] Moriarity visits Sherlock to talk, uses a riddle to threaten him, then disappears. Mycroft warns about four assassins who moved next door to Sherlock. Sherlock investigates missing school children, one left a clue. Bread crumbs in an envelope? Sherlock locates the children. A man who helps Sherlock is shot dead! There is a shocking surprise for Sherlock. [Can you believe this story?] Another man who helps Sherlock is shot dead! Later they meet a very good actor, Richard Brook. [Believable?] A reporter has a scoop on Sherlock: he is a fake! [Isn't this a crazy story?] Moriarity is the most dangerous criminal because of his key code. We hear news about Mrs. Hudson. Holmes and Moriarity meet on a roof top. There is talk about falling. Can Sherlock stop Moriarity's plans? ""No, you're not."" There is a gun shot. Sherlock talks to Watson. [Can this story get even more confused?] A man falls from the rooftop. The paramedics take the body away. Snipers disassemble their rifles and leave the building. Sherlock's friends are safe now. [I hope this is the end of this series.]",1,Another Mess,1336348800,"05 7, 2012",2012,5221,"['Sherlock', 'Season', 'Two', '2011', 'filmWriters', 'lesser', 'talents', 'should', ""n't"", 'try',

After watching a first few episodes from SHERLOCK SEASON 1 for free (because of Prime membership) on my Kindle, I knew this was a show that I could get into and so I bought the first season on Blu-Ray.SHERLOCK SEASON TWO continues on with the great formula that they started in the first season with the graphic embellishments and updating the original stories to match a modern context. Chemistry between Holmes (Cumberbatch) and Watson (Freeman)-- and consequently their relationship -- continues to evolve and there's a shocking cliff hanger on the last episode ""The Reichenbach Fall,"" but I won't give it away.Anyway, definitely pick this up if you like well-acted, brilliantly written, and cunningly executed TV shows.

I think Martin Freeman was funnier in the first series, although the humor is so subtle it is easy to miss.  Americans say they don't get ""British humor"", but it is fantastic to me.Cumberbatch/Sherlock is always entertaining, the ""consulting detective""- a gifted actor and perfect for this role, plus easy on the eyes.  As I have said for Season 1, HOW does he deliver those lines?  Brainy IS the new sexy....The stories are complicated and you may have to watch closely or rewind in parts.  This show is definitely not just eye candy, nor a show to watch for falling asleep.  You will need to use your mind on this series.Other characters: Mycroft is definitely one of my faves as Sherlock's brother- the great Mark Gatiss- the eye rolls are precious!!  He IS the British Government.Moriarity is such a great ""old fashioned"" villain, he adds much to the show, although it is easy to hate him.  Irene Adler (Scandal in Belgravia)was entertaining too, I was wishing for a kiss from Sherlock to her, but I guess that was not where they were going.I have seen some of the criticisms, but I have to ask what other TV shows even come close to the entertainment value of Sherlock?Although I live in the US, I am becoming an honorary citizen of the UK, I think the programming is so much smarter and well done.

Instead we get that nasty little ponce, Moriarty, causing trouble and wreaking the ultimate havoc in the lives of Holmes and Watson. Moriarty isn't out to steal anything, though Mycroft claims that he already has computer code that will grant him access to anything in the world, Moriarty is out to ruin and kill Holmes, the only entertainment left to him.He does this by discrediting Holmes and the fall is far and dark indeed as it always is when it begins at the pinnacle. Holmes is shown as a narcissistic neurotic who faked all of his cases, at times even commiting the crimes for public adulation. How will Holmes escape the trap and will it be as ingenious as the original? We won't know until next season. The writing in the episode is fluent and fast-paced and the acting is as always superb.

Holmes and Watson go up against the sexy dominatrix Irene Adler, played to slinky perfection by Lara Pulver, to uncover a web of government intrigue and deceit. SCANDAL is the perfect mix of humor, action, personality, sharp writing,  and excellent acting from the incomparable Benedict Cumberbatch and the stupendous Martin Freeman. More than that, the twist ending is actually incredibly powerful and surprisingly moving. A Scandal in Belgravia is the Sherlockian formula at it's highest - Steven Moffat's intelligent writing combined with true style and class to create a riveting episode that ranks among TV's finest. 9/10THE HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE: Hounds is the weakest episode of Season 2, but that is not saying much indeed. It's like saying that Return of the Jedi is the worst of the original Star Wars movies - they're ALL great anyways. Hounds is dark and actually quite scary, but ultimately is somewhat disappointing. The suspenseful and excellent buildup leads to a conclusion that is too easy and Deus ex Machina-ish to live up to the first half of the episode. That being said, there are some great scenes, (including one of Sherlock's all-time funniest, which takes place in a Dartmoor pub), and Holmes's ""Mind palace"" sequence - one of the show's best. Russell Tovey is excellent as Henry Knight, Cumberbatch is as difficult as brilliant as we've come to expect, and Martin Freeman has never been Martin Freeman-ier. So while the ending of Hounds was a bit too easy, there's still a great, witty, smart buildup, reminding us that Sherlock is still the greatest detective show on television. 7/10THE REICHENBACH FALL: When I said that A Scandal in Belgravia was my favourite episode I wasn't lying. But The Reichenbach Fall is far and away the *best* episode of Sherlock ever, and deserves to rank among the finest single episodes in telly HISTORY! From the opening scenes, to Moriarty's (played to *electrifying* perfection by Andrew Scott) awe-inspiring theft of the Crown Jewels to the tune of The Thieving Magpie, to Moriarty and Sherlock's heart-to-heart, to the thundering, power-packing, unforgettable ending...Fall is almost perfect. Everything from the writing to the editing, humor, acting, sets, action, dialogue...I can't fault it. This is an episode that remains in the mind long after it's over; such lines as ""Every fairy tale needs a good ol'fashioned villain"" and Sherlock's cryptic erm...final message (spoiler alert?), and the mind-bogglingly good ending will leave you puzzling long after the show is over. All I can say is that Moffat, Gatiss, and Thompson are some clever gents indeed... 10/10January 2014 cannot come soon enough!

1425060,A20IIR0422G3A5,B004QOB8SO,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[5, 5]","I gave the first season DVD of ""Sherlock"" only four stars, because of the weak third episode, which was actually filmed first. As the documentary on Disk 2 says, this season takes on the three biggest Holmes stories, involving Irene Adler, the hound of the Baskervilles, and Sherlock's supposed end and the death of James Moriarity. The first two episodes are brilliant, better than anything in the first season. The third episode, the Reichenbach Fall, is positively out of this world, over the top magnificent.As I was watching it, it occurred to me how much easier it is to write about a character with superhuman, or seemingly superhuman characteristics, such as Jason Bourne, Gandalf the Grey, Jedi knights, and every comic book superhero you can name. You can have them do virtually anything you want, in any given situation. If you need lots of different skills, you create teams like the Fantastic Four or the X-Men or the Avengers. Their roles are one extended deux ex machina. The thing which turns these stories into comic books is that you then must create villains with superhuman powers to make it a fair fight. It also helps if you throw in a secret vulnerability or two such as Kryptonite. The original Sherlock Holmes character is so durable because while his powers appear almost magical, they are never outside the realm of acute human observation and ratiocination, although I think that if a person trained themselves in Holmes' methods, their success rate would be nowhere near Holmes's 96% accuracy. This may also be why Gandalf is such a successful character. You can count on one hand how often he uses overt magic between both ""The Hobbit"" and ""LOTR"".And, in these three episodes, we get a huge helping of the four most freakishly superhuman characters in the Holmes corpus. Aside from Holmes, we get lots of Mycroft Holmes (far more than in the stories), James Moriarty, the ""consulting criminal"" and Irene Adler, whose persona is built up quite a bit from her appearance in only one original story, ""A Scandal in Bohemia"".Just as I was marvelling over my observation about superhuman characters, in episode 3, the writers turn it all around on Sherlock (something which never happens in the stories) and he is, as Lestrade's female sargeant describes him, freakish. His success is in coming to correct conclusions from thin evidence is thought to be too good to be true, and he is indicted for perpetrating a crime he just solved.Here I get into dangerous waters, risking giving too much away. I can only suggest that the richness and cleverness with which these stories are displayed on the screen is far more engaging than anything I, or Arthur Conan Doyle, for that matter, could have put on paper.Possibly the greatest treat is the interaction between Holmes and Moriarty, which virtually never happens in the stories. One of the most marvelous things about Holmes, Mycroft, and Moriarty is that they defy all the usual trademarks ascribed to them by Doyle, they fit into the 21st century perfectly, with no trace of a mannerism saying ""look how clever I am in transplanting these characters"", and yet they are totally true to the soul of the characters created by Doyle. Mycroft and Moriarity are both youngish and thin. Sherlock literally mocks several of the usual trademarks such as his deerstalker cap. Best of all, Moriarty is depicted as quite literally bordering on a kind of brilliant insanity.

1425082,AB34G6VKP28L,B004QOB8SO,"Charity Bishop ""Film Fanatic""","[68, 96]","I love these modern interpretations of the classic character created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in the 1880's. This is the same Sherlock Holmes that stalked those foggy London streets, albeit a bit ruder, but now he has a cell phone!Leave it to a madman to give up far too easily. When last we saw Sherlock Holmes (Benedict Cumberbatch), he was a bit tied up with Moriarty waiting for a bomb to go off in his face, but one phone call and his arch-nemesis calls the whole thing off, since he has better things to do. Sherlock returns to his flat with his best friend John Watson (Martin Freeman) and proceeds to be bored... with a lot of things. With his newfound popularity, with the fact that John's blog is a big hit, with the photographers following him around, and the lackluster cases brought to him concerning missing ashes and dead grandfathers and so forth. He wants something better, something to capture his interest... and he's about to get it.One morning bright and early, Sherlock is plucked from the flat and taken to Buckingham Palace for a little chat with his elder brother Mycroft (Mark Gatiss). It seems that a professional dominatrix named Irene Adler has some photographs of a member of the royal family that they would really rather not got out to the press. One would assume it was for purpose of blackmail, but other than informing them of the incriminating images, Irene has not asked for anything else. This peaks his interest and alleviates his boredom and somewhat reluctantly he agrees to investigate and manipulate her out of the contents of her phone, little realizing that Irene intends to be one step ahead of him the entire way.Where through subsequent viewings of this episode, I managed to untangle my initial horrified reaction from my ability to be impartial, I must say that my first time through the season premiere was a bit... uncomfortable. Not only has series creator and head writer Steven Moffat taken one of the more remarkable women in Doyle's stories and regressed her feminism and intelligence back a couple of centuries, he has also made that first hour and a half a bit rough going if you plan on having your family in the room. Irene is a bisexual dominatrix that spends an entire scene in the buff (the camera is careful, but we still get an eyefull).My feelings about this season are varied. It has some truly wonderful moments but I'm a bit torn by the Irene Adler fiasco. Moffat, who is usually known for his tight plots, goes out on a limb with a complicated and confusing episode that is not quite up to par with the second episode, in which Mark Gatiss modernizes the most famous of all Holmes mysteries, The Hound of the Baskervilles. Now that is a brilliant hour and a half of television, with enough references to the original to please fans but an independent conclusion all its own, so do not anticipate things turning out the same way after all.The third episode is also the most emotional and if you have not read the original stories, you may want to prepare for a horrific twist toward the end. I'm not quite certain where as a fan I stand on their interpretation of Moriarty as a pure madman but I must say that among other things (such as not having Watson be a dolt, as many adaptations fumble in that area) their interpretation of Mycroft Holmes is inspired. He has the right amount of sheer humanity and genius, a touch of arrogance and insult that makes him identifiable as a Holmes but a bit more distance than his brother. Each of the three episodes has its allure in clever writing and memorable moments, throwing in humorous antics as well as more serious and life-threatening situations. I'm a bit sorry that the premiere had so many issues in it because near-nudity aside, it's actually an intriguing installment. Many viewers may find the constant references to homosexuality tiring as I do, but overall Sherlock is still one of the finest things on television and at the end of its short season, leaves us wanting more.",3,Hated What Was Done to Irene Adler,1332892800,"03 28, 2012",2012,4001,"['love', 'modern', 'interpretations', 'classic', 'character', 'created', 'Sir', 'Arthur', 'Conan', 'Doyle', '1880', 'same', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'stalked', 'foggy', 'London', 'streets', 'bit', 'ruder', 'now', 'cell', 'phone', 'Leave', 'madman', 'give', 'up', 'far', 'too', 'easily', 'When', 'last', 'saw', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'Benedict', 'Cumberbatch', 'was', 'bit', 'tied', 'up', 'Moriarty', 'waiting', 'bomb', 'go', 'off', 'face', 'one', 'phone', 'call', 'arch-nemesis', 'whole', 'thing', 'off', 'better', 'things', 'do', 'Sherlock', 'returns', 'flat', 'best', 'friend', 'John', 'Watson', 'Martin', 'Freeman', 'proceeds', 'be', 'bored', 'lot', 'things', 'newfound', 'popularity', 'fact', 'John', 'blog', 'big', 'hit', 'photographers', 'following', 'around', 'lackluster', 'cases', 'brought', 'concerning', 'missing', 'ashes', 'dead', 'grandfathers', 'so', 'forth', 'something', 'better', 'something', 'capture', 'interest', 'get', 'it.One', 'morning', 'bright', 'early', 'Sherlock', 'plucked', 'flat', 'taken', 'Buckingham', 'Palace', 'little', 'chat', 'elder', 'brother', 'Mycroft', 'Mark', 'Gatiss', 'professional', 'dominatrix', 'named', 'Irene', 'Adler', 'photographs', 'member', 'royal', 'family', 'would', 'really', 'rather', 'not', 'got', 'out', 'press', 'One', 'would', 'assume', 'was', 'purpose', 'blackmail', 'other', 'informing', 'incriminating', 'images', 'Irene', 'not', 'asked', 'anything', 'else', 'interest', 'boredom', 'somewhat', 'reluctantly', 'investigate', 'manipulate', 'contents', 'phone', 'little', 'realizing', 'Irene', 'be', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'entire', 'way.Where', 'subsequent', 'viewings', 'episode', 'managed', 'untangle', 'initial', 'horrified', 'reaction', 'ability', 'be', 'impartial', 'must', 'say', 'first', 'time', 'season', 'premiere', 'was', 'bit', 'uncomfortable', 'Not', 'only', 'series', 'creator', 'head', 'writer', 'Steven', 'Moffat', 'taken', 'one', 'more', 'remarkable', 'women', 'Doyle', 'stories', 'regressed', 'feminism', 'intelligence', 'back', 'couple', 'centuries', 'also', 'made', 'first', 'hour', 'half', 'bit', 'rough', 'going', 'plan', 'having', 'family', 'room', 'Irene', 'bisexual', 'dominatrix', 'entire', 'scene', 'buff', 'camera', 'careful', 'still', 'get', 'eyefull', 'feelings', 'season', 'are', 'varied', 'truly', 'wonderful', 'moments', ""'m"", 'bit', 'torn', 'Irene', 'Adler', 'fiasco', 'Moffat', 'who', 'usually', 'known', 'tight', 'plots', 'out', 'limb', 'complicated', 'confusing', 'episode', 'not', 'quite', 'par', 'second', 'episode', 'Mark', 'Gatiss', 'most', 'famous', 'Holmes', 'mysteries', 'Hound', 'Baskervilles', 'Now', 'brilliant', 'hour', 'half', 'television', 'enough', 'references', 'original', 'please', 'fans', 'independent', 'conclusion', 'own', 'so', 'do', 'not', 'anticipate', 'things', 'turning', 'out', 'same', 'way', 'all.The', 'third', 'episode', 'also', 'most', 'emotional', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'original', 'stories', 'may', 'want', 'prepare', 'horrific', 'twist', 'end', ""'m"", 'not', 'quite', 'certain', 'where', 'fan', 'stand', 'interpretation', 'Moriarty', 'pure', 'madman', 'must', 'say', 'other', 'things', 'such', 'not', 'having', 'Watson', 'be', 'dolt', 'many', 'adaptations', 'fumble', 'area', 'interpretation', 'Mycroft', 'Holmes', 'inspired', 'right', 'amount', 'sheer', 'humanity', 'genius', 'touch', 'arrogance', 'insult', 'identifiable', 'Holmes', 'bit', 'more', 'distance', 'brother', 'three', 'episodes', 'allure', 'clever', 'writing', 'memorable', 'moments', 'throwing', 'humorous', 'antics', 'as', 'well', 'more', 'serious', 'life-threatening', 'situations', ""'m"", 'bit', 'sorry', 'premiere', 'had', 'so', 'many', 'issues', 'near-nudity', 'aside', 'actually', 'intriguing', 'installment', 'Many', 'viewers', 'may', 'find', 'constant', 'references', 'homosexuality', 'tiring', 'do', 'overall', 'Sherlock', 'still', 'one', 'finest', 'things', 'television', 'end', 'short', 'season', 'wanting', 'more']",Sherlock: Season 2

It's a nice way to portray it, but it really moved things ahead.  But knowing most British television series (I said 'most') have a 2-4 year run, I guess they wanted to move ahead before Cumberbatch and Freeman get too busy with film!Each episode is around 90 minutes, so the viewer has plenty of time to get acquainted with the story and the characters in each.

I enjoyed the Jeremy Brett series, generally hated Basil Rathbone, and have enjoyed the 2 Robert Downey movies...so when this series came out, I was curious, to say the least.It's a completely different take. Rather than attempt to redo the stories authentically (as they did with the Jeremy Brett stuff) or re-imagine them in steampunk London at the turn of the last century (as they did with the Guy Ritchie films that star Robert Downey Jr.) they've essentially translated Sherlock Holmes to modern-day London, complete with an expertise in computers, and rumors that Sherlock and his flat-mate, Dr. Watson, are gay lovers. The whole thing is amusing as hell, and there are constant references to the original Conan Doyle stories. In one memorable sequence a very nerdy guy says a bunch of stuff, and then someone else translates for him--and that's ""The Geek Interpreter"", a reference to a short story titled ""The Greek Interpreter"" which the show's producers have apparently decided isn't suitable for adaptation to the modern world.My only complaint about this show is that it's way too short. Where else but England could a TV network have a ""series"" that has ""seasons"" that last 3 episodes? In America we call that a ""mini-series"". Seriously, they need to get their act together. The producers apparently weren't quite prepared for how well the show did this year on American TV, because they've already decided (because of scheduling conflicts with the stars, etc.) not to do the next season for another year and a half.

Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman are priceless and wildly entertaining as consulting detective Sherlock Holmes and Doctor John Watson in 21st Century London.  This season's stories are extremely well executed riffs on Conan Doyle's familiar stories.  Supporting cast members Mrs. Hudson, Inspector Lestrade, and even poor Molly the lovesick forensics technician get good parts to play.The first episode is ""A Scandal in Belgravia"", a superb reimagining of ""A Scandal in Bohemia"", in which Sherlock Holmes faces Irena Adler, ""the woman"", who in this version is a dominatrix.  This redo extends the story, and the relationship, in some interesting directions without sacrificing the delicious duel of wits between the two, including an excellent twist at the end.""The Hounds of Baskerville"" has the temerity to take on the legendary Sherlock Holmes story ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"", and gets away with it, envisioning an updated and truly menacing threat for Holmes and Watson to face on Dartmoor. Even Sherlock will have his relentlessly rational mind rattled just a bit.""The Reichenbach Fall"" is a redo of the Final Problem"", placing the fatal duel between Holmes and Moriarty in a modern context with modern weapons, and an ending that will keep the viewer guessing to the credits.Production values for these episodes are excellent, with fascinating mixtures of venues and visual magic, including the portrayal of Holmes' skill at deduction in near real time.

""eblunt777""","[6, 8]","BluntReview says: Brains are indeed the new sexy...and Sherlock Series Two delivers multiple, err, pleasures...In fact it's a trifecta for the brain endorphin-wise. You get a heaping helping of raw sexy, mystery and intrigue complete with scary bits, and the finale serves up a gut-wrenching thrill. And Sherlock Series Two's three new films dare to step forward into the Doyle Classics; Scandal in Bohemia, Hound of the Baskervilles and The Final Problem.Oh, yes, they went there, and the reworks work. Hell, they've even neatly managed to work in the infamous deerstalker! It's hard to top the phenom the whole production crew brought us in the first myth-shifting series. I mean they had to approach concisely the bromance, the modernization and of course nod to all us Holmesians - with our self-righteous eyes looking for any flaw; complete with the ""Why I oughttas"" awaiting. But, worldwide we were quietly awed then thunderously applauding.We are brought back in with, 'A Scandal in Belgravia.' Of course the title is obvious. And the ""plot"" is about royalty and scandalous pictures. Normally a yawn, ah, but not here there Johnny. Sherlock (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Watson (Martin Freeman) run around in gloriuos subplot land as the real focus is on one woman - The Woman - Irene Adler (Lara Pulver). All the series of films thus far has attempted to knock you upside the head with how not gay Watson is, but, have left Sherlock up to one's imagination. Is this man an Elder Virgin or perhaps...But as we shall all discover all the lad needed was an equally brilliant brain-force and some good old-fashioned gorgeous-to-boot looks thrown in and he too can be befuddled by the opposite sex. Purr. Snap. (&lt;- if you know what I'm typing here...and I think that you do)The acting in these sexually-fueled frames is particularly brilliant from the trio; S, J and I. Watch the eyes and tells.Next up is The Hounds of Baskerville. Now how on Earth are they going to manage this work you may harrumph aloud as the film starts. Fear not, they have and quite (as we are coming to expect) brilliantly. Clever is too mundane a word. Brilliant too used. Let's just go ahead and say it. But, here, the word is neither over used or quaint. The film is genius.Oh there's something going on out there on the moors alright Joe, and you'll have eyes fixed upon the television wondering just what this hound thing is anyway!There are some clues: Baskerville is now a military testing area, and strange people do strange things, the townsfolk don't mind having a dog beast for fiscal intake purposes, and one young man has a long history with the hound....which would have to be either on a third generation, or twenty odd years old and still running about tearing poor moor wanderers apart like an old chewie toy. And, thankfully, there's plenty of foggy atmospheric additions to help your psyche go along for the hunt.Finally they've attempted, and succeeded, in The Reichenbach Fallre-imagining. This film is so completely thrilling, I forewarn you not to eat prior to viewing or your tummy is sure to burp and bother at you in protest through out.Moriaty (Andrew Scott) is back and he's even more twisted and riddled up in a conundrum then when we first met him temper-tantruming about at the pool. Moriaty is the Yin to Sherlock's Yang. He almost steals the show - both actor and character. Seething evil and diction the actor is given some of the smarter bits ever caught by a lens. This Scott fellow can act. Yes he can. Have they actually put belladonna drops in his eyes? Or does he actually look like that? Hmm.The premise, or plot, starts to shape up to be about how once an idea is planted in one's mind there's no uprooting. Kind of like you can not un-hear something. That's really all I can say without slipping the game up.Be aware R Falls' end is sure to leave you utterly breathless and perhaps stunned with a tear or two rolling down your face....I'm just saying. I can say no more.Except to say, the characters you've immediately come to know and enjoy are all back and in the crispest of form from Series One; Mycroft (Mark Gatiss), Mrs. Hudson (Una Stubbs), suffering Molly (Loo Brealey) and Lestrade (Rupert Graves).DVD kit bonuses include a short on behind the scenes where cast and crew share the warmth of reception and show you how they shot a few really swell scenes and audio commentary.Once again I bow to all in and around the production for a tremendously entertaining few evenings.Snack recommendations: Pack of cigarettes for Scandal -

I was skeptical at first about updating Sherlock Holmes to modern times, but was pleasantly surprised by Season One.  However, I was blown away by Season Two.  There are, again, just three episodes per season, but each one runs about an hour and a half, so its like having three mini-movies per season.  I guess that's okay and it's only my lust for more Sherlock that makes me wish for more in each season.The plotlines are great--shocking at times, never ever boring and much of the time you find yourself surprised, which so rarely happens in tv shows most of the time.  The acting is absolutely terrific, especially the relationship shown between Sherlock and Watson.  While, Sherlock himself remains the central figure that verges on superhuman, but with all of the strengths he owns also reflecting themselves as his faults.  I adore the idea of his ""mind palace.""  I love how they've chosen to show us, the watcher, how his mind works...using words and arrows, etc to outline for us (poor normal mortals) how this brilliant madman thinks.  While Mycroft...oh my.We are introduced to ""the woman"" in this season, the famous Adler, who comes the closest to being able to think like the Holmes brothers.  I loved this episode and how it ended, another shocker.  The Hound episode was interestingly updated, but I still think it was the weak point of the season.  In any other show, it would have been terrific, but not with the high standards set up by this.  While, the final episode was...oh dear...well, brilliant.  Yes, just absolutely brilliant.All I can say about Moriarty...he is one scary guy.  One profoundly scary guy.  One of the best villians in ages.This show has now readily convinced me that not only does Sherlock work as set in modern times, but it even comes across as through it may, in some ways, fit more handily in modern times.  I mean, I could see how Sherlock's mind works can be compared to an intelligent computer network.  While, updating Watson's books to a blog--yes!  I also deeply enjoy the tongue-in-cheek way they sometimes poke at the Sherlock Myth (such as the cap).  They can get away with it because you also feel the deep respect in this show that they have for the work of Doyle and for the characters of Sherlock and Watson.Watch it!  Buy it!  Watch it again!

This BBC series is without a doubt one of the most entertaining of any of the Holmes series, ever. Benedict Cumberbatch is awesome, as snippy and cranky as Jeremy Brett at his best on the older 1980s/90s BBC series and films, many of which I also recommend.The Brits use the word ""clever"" very freely, and this word best sums up the BBC's approach to these episodes; all six so far are equally enthralling. The producers have thoroughly thought through how best to ""modernize"" Holmes, Watson, Mrs. Hudson, Lestrat, Irene Adler, and of course Moriarity; they utilize various contemporary London settings and a great deal of contemporary technology. The stories are the finest updating of these now classic, revered stories you will ever see, and I include the two Robert Downey movies, which suffer from a redefinition of Holmes as a mere action hero. This series doesn't stint on action, but it is above all extremely, well, clever.These episodes are packed with a dizzying array of visual and verbal ideas. They are dense, beautiful, and, unfortunately, a bit hard to understand with American ears, which makes the familiar mysteries all the more mysterious at times.If you are a fan of Holmes in any format, don't miss this series. Watch the episodes in the order they were broadcast if you can. We are all breathlessly awaiting Season 3 in whatever format we are ""allowed"" to watch, and it looks like amazon, bless their hearts, will be there first, well ahead of the digital competition.(As an aside, be careful to download HD if that's what you want to watch--and you SHOULD want that format. Amazon's download interface is pretty good but the distinction between Standard (yuck) and HD is obscure.The HD version is easy to miss, being at the moment only an add-on to a show's title. As a result I twice downloaded the unwanted Standard versions. Amazon did immediately refund my wrongly downloaded titles (which are cheaper), but I can't stand Standard if HD is available.

1425195,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B004QOB8SO,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[382, 404]","Such was the ego-stroking the cast & creators received for their first series of SHERLOCK, they couldn't help but gain huge confidence as they try to top themselves in Series 2. Steven Moffat always did have roaring self-esteem, and so he and co-creator Mark Gattis shrugged and decided to take on the three most iconic touchstones in the Sherlock Holmes canon. Series 2 is a (mostly) brilliant reworking of, in Moffat's own words, ""the Hound, the Woman, and the Professor.""It was a ba11sy move to reimagine Sherlock Holmes in 21st Century England. That it worked tremendously is due to smart writing and the amazing chemistry between the two leads, Cumberbatch and Freeman. The writers inserted clever touches such as the onscreen texts which reveal Holmes' instantaneous deductions and his ready application of contemporary tools (cell phones, the Internet, etc.) to aid his investigations. In this universe, Holmes attains his clients primarily thru Watson's popular online blog in which the good doctor recounts Holmes' cases. The writers and creators are so cocky nowadays that they don't hesitate to inject broader bits of comedy (an act of heresy were this show not as good). As such we witness fleeting play-on-word references to Holmes' more trivial cases such as ""The Geek Interpreter"" and ""The Speckled Blonde."" For whatever reason, I smile whenever the camera pans to Speedy's Sandwich Bar & Cafe, atop of which is where Holmes and Watson share lodgings, very much still 221B Baker Street. At heart, Sherlock Holmes is still very much the cold, calculating machine. But Series 2 aims to poke a hole in that stance.""A Scandal in Belgravia"" picks up where Series 1 left off, a cliffhanger involving Watson strapped onto an explosives vest and a stand-off between Holmes and weird international consulting criminal James Moriarty. This matter is resolved within moments (or, more likely, put on the shelf), with Moriarty casually sauntering off to torment Holmes on a later day. ""A Scandal in Belgravia"" is this series' compelling adaptation of ""A Scandal in Bohemia,"" the story that introduced the world's most famous femme fatale in literature, the crafty and alluring Irene Adler. In this incarnation, Irene Adler is a dominatrix (someone refers to what she does as ""recreational scolding""; heh). She blackmails her high end clientele with compromising images she stores in her mobile phone. One such victim happens to be closely linked to the royal crown, and so that Internet phenom, Sherlock Holmes, is dragged (clad only in bed sheets) into the affair. I will say that ""A Scandal in Belgravia"" is an utter pleasure to watch. For one thing, it delivers two amusing comments about Holmes' trousers.This is the most fleshed-out (in more ways than one) that Irene Adler has ever been portrayed on screen. Lara Pulver is classy and mesmerizing as ""The Woman,"" and she creates plenty of sparks with Cumberbatch. Irene Adler certainly gets under Holmes' skin. Holmes eventually takes possession of Irene's all-important cell phone but for most of the episode he's stumped by the access password. The solution, when it finally arrives, drew a big smile from my mug.I wasn't as enamoured of ""The Hounds of Baskerville,"" which I thought was the weakest episode, and yet still quite watchable. But, then again, I wasn't that fond of the original story, either, so I do claim some bias. Some of the original plot survives: that of a man in the atmospheric moors being stalked by an infernal hound. But then we eye the forbidding British army compound and the conspiracy theorists, and that's the modern spin in play. If ""A Scandal in Belgravia"" introduced Sherlock Holmes to a twisted kind of passion (it's questionable whether it's love he feels for Irene), ""The Hounds of Baskerville"" shoved terror directly in his face. It's a bit jarring to see the aloof detective quivering in fright.The deadly mind games between Holmes and Moriarty escalate in the riveting third episode, ""The Reichenbach Fall."" The story opens with Moriarty allowing himself to be captured by the constabulary after three daring simultaneous break-ins. I won't say more except that it's all part of Moriarty's devious plan to get Sherlock Holmes, that this pushes Holmes to the very brink of defeat, that this may be the finest bit of acting I've seen from Martin Freeman (one of cinema's finest reactors), and that Andrew Scott (""Moriarty"") redeems himself from his previous what-the-hell-was-that? appearances. Really, no universe should exist in which Moriarty throws a raspberry.SHERLOCK - THE COMPLETE SERIES TWO comes with 2 discs and the following bonus features (or the Region 2 set does, anyway):- lively audio commentary on ""A Scandal in Belgravia"" with co-creators/writers Steven Moffat & Mark Gatiss (who also is rather good as ""Mycroft Holmes""), producer Sue Vertue, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Lara Pulver- audio commentary on ""Hounds of Baskerville"" with Moffat, Gatiss, Vertue, and actor Russell Tovey (""Henry Knight"")- ""Sherlock Uncovered"" - featurette which offers an overview of the three episodes comprising Series 2 (00:19:06 minutes)",5,"""We are in Buckingham Palace, the very heart of the British nation.

Fans are left wanting more and knowing they have to wait for more episodes.Benedict Cumberbatch is absolutely amazing as the modern Sherlock Holmes with a twist. This Sherlock is ego-centric and rude yet he possesses amazing detective skills. No one can solve a crime like Sherlock and soon his fame could be his downfall. It looks like the writers, director and stars have taken the international success and tweaked the story of this family literary hero even further. Season 2 is more intense and more dark in its stories. Sherlock is more wrapped in his mind that ever which leads him to be more unstable and unpredictable. Season 2's Sherlock is darker and more self-absorbed than before. His rudeness and impatience with people is stronger. No one can match his superior intellect so they just waste his time.It's amazing how off-putting yet likeable Sherlock is. He offends everyone yet he solves the mystery every time. His exact extent of relationship with John Watson is questioned even deeper. Is there more than just a deep respect for Sherlock that keeps Watson at his side. It's interesting how the writers play with the story and how the success of last season has made them more self-confident and more daring in the risks they take in their storyline. It's a remarkably compelling and unique show.It can get tedious following Sherlock's train of thought as he quickly sizes up a person or situation. One look at a person and he can tell their life story. A bit over the top and obsessive, maybe, but fun.Season 2 ends with a shocking cliffhanger but we soon get our answer which leads to an even bigger question..What just happened? The writers are spot on with the ending. We HAVE to see Season 3 to see how the impossible was possible.SHERLOCK probably isn't for everyone but it certainly is fresh and exciting. A popular classic hero is remodeled and revisited in the modern era.

1425220,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B004QOB8SO,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[11, 14]","While Season One of BBC's SHERLOCK was insanely entertaining, incredibly intelligent, and remarkably well-acted, just three episodes wasn't enough. Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss did an extraordinary thing with the iconic tales of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle: They MODERNIZED it. While that isn't a particularly remarkable thing in and of itself, what REALLY is extraordinary about this series is that the modernization WORKED flawlessly.This season (which just ended last night in the U.S. being broadcast on PBS with some rather controversial editing since apparently eight minutes of each episode had to be chopped off to make room for PBS advertising) was not just better than the first season, it was more involving from a character standpoint. We got a much better glimpse into the souls of Sherlock Holmes (the wonderful Benedict Cumberbatch, who is rapidly becoming one of the hardest working men in Hollywood as well) and his faithful companion Dr. John Watson (the equally great Martin Freeman). The wonderful thing that this show has done since its inception has been to not marginalize the friendship between Holmes and Watson, but also not marginalizing Watson himself. While he is in constant awe of Holmes' remarkable deductive skills, he's also his own man and not the plump, blundering buffoonish character of old adaptations, and he makes important contributions to each case.This season does only give us three more episodes, but each episode is essentially one feature-length film. The first episode is the best of the entire series yet, ""A Scandal In Belgravia"", which introduces this incarnation of Sherlock Holmes to the character of Irene Adler, who casual fans of the detective have seen as portrayed by Rachel McAdams in both of the Downey Jr./Law SHERLOCK HOLMES films. She is originally, as portrayed in Guy Ritchie's entertaining films, an American who moves to Europe and becomes a ""courtesan"" who is something of a foil and love interest for Holmes. In this episode though, Adler (Lara Pulver of MI-5) is a dominatrix who has enough secrets on her mobile phone to practically bring down the entirety of England. She enters into something of a game of obsession with Holmes. This game does bring other players, naturally, and soon Holmes is looking at something much larger. Cumberbatch and Pulver bring a very heightened sense of sexual tension to their scenes together, as Holmes feels something more for this woman than for any other woman in his life. Although, I have to say that arguably my favorite part in this episode is where we see how strong the bonds are between Holmes and his maternal landlady Mrs. Hudson (the wonderful Una Stubbs). The message is clear: Don't mess with the friends of Sherlock Holmes.Then comes ""The Hounds of Baskerville"", which is the least of this season. A troubled young man comes to Holmes and Watson with the tale of a gigantic hound that killed his father years before in the countryside area of Dartmoor. At first, Holmes is astonishingly bored with the idea of this case, but something the young man says specifically pricks up his ears and the game is afoot. Also in Dartmoor is a government research facility called Baskerville, where apparently many secret experiments are being done, including genetic research. Could there be a military experiment of the creation of a huge dog? Is the explanation more complex even than that? There were many things to love about this episode, with one of my favorite moments being that of Holmes trying to quit smoking and references a ""seven percent solution"", but this was the only episode when I felt like I was ahead of Holmes and exactly what was happening and how it was happening. It still works and it is still very entertaining, particularly Cumberbatch's performance as he first truly feels the effects of fear and panic for perhaps the first time in his life.Finally, we have ""The Reichenbach Fall"", which is a reference to the final confrontation between Holmes and his arch-nemesis James Moriarty. This episode, like the finale of the first season ""The Great Game"", is extremely dark and foreboding, as well it should be since you can't really have a light-hearted take on the mental combat between Holmes and Moriarty (played with flamboyant and psychotic relish by Andrew Scott). There's nothing I really want to say about this episode that can do it justice, but it's incredibly smart, incredibly tense and incredibly disturbing.The other thing that the show has been so brilliant at doing is giving a more realistic (and more modern) take on the friendship between Holmes and Watson. It never tries to imply that they are more than friends, but the hordes of readers and critics of the Holmes/Watson partnership over the decades have done enough examinations of their own to come to the illogical conclusion that Holmes and Watson are lovers. These people are repeatedly poked fun at via the voice of Watson as he reads or hears or sees people who see the two of them as lovers, which is a bit of a running gag throughout the season, and Freeman plays it perfectly with just the right mixture of offense and incredulity. The other primary relationship here is that of Sherlock's relationship with his brother Mycroft (played by Mark Gatiss). Their relationship is strained beyond repair, but there's something touching about Mycroft's concern for his younger brother while at the same time, as in ""A Scandal in Belgravia"", where Mycroft knows his brother's incapability to work within the confines of normal society.It's always a joy to see a program about extremely intelligent people that is created by extremely intelligent people. While I've never been a fan of DOCTOR WHO, I was extremely impressed with Moffat's updating of the Jekyll/Hyde tale in the series JEKYLL with the great James Nesbitt.SHERLOCK will have ""competition"" soon on U.S. television as the upcoming CBS series ELEMENTARY with Johnny Lee Miller as Holmes and Lucy Liu as Watson (?) in yet another update, but apparently with the added attraction of doing some gender-bending. If this is anything like all the other procedural mysteries on CBS, it will probably be hugely successful from a ratings standpoint, but will be a massive creative failure. But it might well get people interested in this series, and that might just be good enough.",5,Think CBS can top this?

They contradicted saying I should watch ""Sherlock"".  Since this person and I have very similar taste in movies, I watched an episode.  We do not have a good modern Sherlock Holmes.  We have a great Sherlock Holmes set in modern London.  Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman might be the best Holms and Watson of all time.  They are very believable and a perfect fit for the roles.  Excellent casting is one of the series greatest strengths.  Each part is carefully cast to give us the right look and sound for each part.  Modern London is as much a part of the show as the main characters.  The producers use the city, cell phones, social networks, laptops and modern mores to establish a current day story.Sherlock Holmes is simply the most observant and smartest person in the world.  He uses these skills to solve the unsolvable puzzle.  His skills make him unpopular with many people and Holmes has no problem disliking them too.  He is prone to hurt felling and/or embarrasses people and be oblivious of this.  Study in Pink and A Scandal in Belgravia shows Holmes at his worst.  His ego forces him to demonstrate these unique abilities while hurting people's feelings.Doctor Watson is both loyal and annoyed often at the same time.  Watson is the human part and the series faithfully reproduces that.  The two actors play off each other to establish a real relationship that looks and sounds right.Inspector Lestrade is a very smart man and a good cop.  He uses Holmes and has a grudging fondness for him.Each episode is a 90-minute movie.  The scripts are adapted from Doyle's stories with respect but changed as required.  The producers show both respect and love for the original stories.  This is NOT an exploitation of the name for a quick buck.  This careful telling is true to the original but adapted to our times.Each season has three episodes and special features.  These are the three classic stories and they are excellent.A Scandal in Belgravia a surprising adult adaptation of this story.The Hound of Baskerville might be the best retelling I have seen.  It is the story we know and love but with an entirely new perspective.The Reichenbach Falls based on Doyle's' short story The Finial Problem"", in which Holmes and Moriarty square off.  This is an excellent story of hate and ego.The two season run together and you will want both.  Save a second order and the waiting, order the two now.Everyone involved and the fans want to do a third season.  However, the producers and the cast have not been able to schedule the time to do it.

1425233,A1ZR8F86DJRVLX,B004QOB8SO,Jason Bean,"[7, 8]","The first season of BBC TV's 'Sherlock' was easily my favorite show of 2010. The updating of the traditional characters created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was surprisingly effective in a modern-day setting and created some of the most fun and suspenseful episodes of TV I've ever seen.  This second season of 'Sherlock' has a lot of great moments (and one outstanding final episode) but is also a bit uneven and lacks some of the freshness of the starting season.The first episode of 'Sherlock: Season Two' picks up where the season one cliffhanger left off, with Holmes and Watson in a life-threatening stalemate with arch-villain Moriarty. After ""escaping"" Holmes and Watson are put onto a case involving blackmailing dominatrix Irene Adler (the con-artist from the Arthur Conan Doyle stories) in the fun but wildly inconsistant ""A Scandal in Belgravia"". The second episode, ""The Hounds of Baskerville"" is a more straight-forward mystery as the two detectives take on a modern variation of the famous novel ('Hound of Baskervilles' along with hints of the story 'Devil's Foot'). Then things finally come to a head with a showdown between Holmes and Moriarty in ""The Reichenbach Fall"".Like the first season of 'Sherlock', each episode has it's merits but not all are equal in quality. I liked Irene Adler at first thanks to Lara Pulver's performance and some clever writing: her being unclothed when meeting Holmes so he couldn't ""read"" or ""deduce"" anything about her was a nice touch and showed just how much smarter than Holmes she could be. Unfortunately the tone of the episode kept changing on the fly (with waaaaaay too many red-herrings) as did Irene's personality and it was hard to get a grasp on how we're supposed to feel about her character. 'Hounds of Baskerville' was much more consistant with some touching character development from Holmes, Watson and guest character Henry Knight (a terrific Russell Tovey) but also felt unconnected from the overall plot and didn't seem to really go anywhere. Much like the first season of 'Sherlock', it's the final episode that makes this season worthwhile and it's exciting seeing a vulnerable Holmes in a fight for his life against the schemes of Moriarty.As with the first season, 'Sherlock: Season Two' has engaging performances from it's actors. Benedict Cumberbatch is making the character of Holmes his own and is excellent when showing Holmes' more vulnerable side. Series creator Mark Gatiss is given more to do this season as Holmes' brother Mycroft as is Rupert Graves as Lestrade. Andrew Scott creates a creepy and dangerous villain in Moriarty and you feel the tension ratchet up whenever he's on-screen. As usual the best performance in 'Sherlock' comes from Martin Freeman: he was born to play John Watson and the conviction of his performance (and his humanity) keeps you anchored to every episode even as the stories spin out of control.This second series of 'Sherlock' may be a bit rocky and lacking in the freshness of season one, but it's engaging character development, clever mysteries and outstanding season finale make this a DVD set worth buying.",4,Exciting (if uneven) continuation of an outstanding show!,1337990400,"05 26, 2012",2012,3124,"['first', 'season', 'BBC', 'TV', ""'Sherlock"", 'was', 'easily', 'favorite', 'show', '2010', 'updating', 'traditional', 'characters', 'created', 'Sir', 'Arthur', 'Conan', 'Doyle', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'effective', 'modern-day', 'setting', 'created', 'most', 'fun', 'suspenseful', 'episodes', 'TV', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'second', 'season', ""'Sherlock"", 'lot', 'great', 'moments', 'one', 'outstanding', 'final', 'episode', 'also', 'bit', 'uneven', 'freshness', 'starting', 'season.The', 'first', 'episode', ""'Sherlock"", 'Season', 'Two', 'picks', 'where', 'season', 'one', 'cliffhanger', 'left', 'off', 'Holmes', 'Watson', 'life-threatening', 'stalemate', 'arch-villain', 'Moriarty', 'escaping', 'Holmes', 'Watson', 'are', 'put', 'case', 'involving', 'blackmailing', 'dominatrix', 'Irene', 'Adler', 'con-artist', 'Arthur', 'Conan', 'Doyle', 'stories', 'fun', 'wildly', 'inconsistant', 'Scandal', 'Belgravia', 'second', 'episode', 'Hounds', 'Baskerville', 'more', 'straight-forward', 'mystery', 'two', 'detectives', 'take', 'modern', 'variation', 'famous', 'novel', ""'Hound"", 'Baskervilles', 'hints', 'story', 'Foot', 'Then', 'things', 'finally', 'come', 'head', 'showdown', 'Holmes', 'Moriarty', 'Reichenbach', 'Fall', 'first', 'season', ""'Sherlock"", 'episode', 'merits', 'not', 'are', 'equal', 'quality', 'liked', 'Irene', 'Adler', 'first', 'thanks', 'Lara', 'Pulver', 'performance', 'clever', 'writing', 'being', 'unclothed', 'when', 'meeting', 'Holmes', 'could', ""n't"", 'read', 'deduce', 'anything', 'was', 'nice', 'touch', 'showed', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'smarter', 'Holmes', 'could', 'be', 'Unfortunately', 'tone', 'episode', 'kept', 'changing', 'fly', 'waaaaaay', 'too', 'many', 'red-herrings', 'did', 'Irene', 'personality', 'was', 'hard', 'get', 'grasp', 'how', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'feel', 'character', ""'Hounds"", 'Baskerville', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'consistant', 'touching', 'character', 'development', 'Holmes', 'Watson', 'guest', 'character', 'Henry', 'Knight', 'terrific', 'Russell', 'Tovey', 'also', 'felt', 'unconnected', 'overall', 'plot', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'really', 'go', 'anywhere', 'Much', 'first', 'season', ""'Sherlock"", 'final', 'episode', 'season', 'worthwhile', 'exciting', 'seeing', 'vulnerable', 'Holmes', 'fight', 'life', 'schemes', 'Moriarty.As', 'first', 'season', ""'Sherlock"", 'Season', 'Two', 'engaging', 'performances', 'actors', 'Benedict', 'Cumberbatch', 'making', 'character', 'Holmes', 'own', 'excellent', 'when', 'showing', 'Holmes', 'more', 'vulnerable', 'side', 'Series', 'creator', 'Mark', 'Gatiss', 'given', 'more', 'do', 'season', 'Holmes', 'brother', 'Mycroft', 'Rupert', 'Graves', 'Lestrade', 'Andrew', 'Scott', 'creepy', 'dangerous', 'villain', 'Moriarty', 'feel', 'tension', 'up', 'whenever', 'on-screen', 'usual', 'best', 'performance', ""'Sherlock"", 'Martin', 'Freeman', 'was', 'born', 'play', 'John', 'Watson', 'conviction', 'performance', 'humanity', 'anchored', 'episode', 'even', 'stories', 'spin', 'control.This', 'second', 'series', ""'Sherlock"", 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'rocky', 'lacking', 'freshness', 'season', 'one', 'engaging', 'character', 'development', 'clever', 'mysteries', 'outstanding', 'season', 'finale', 'make', 'DVD', 'set', 'worth', 'buying']",Sherlock: Season 2

And in each is there some element that makes Sherlock Holmes uncomfortably human. Especially in ""The Hounds of Baskerville,"" where he deals with doubt and fear, and doesn't like it.With the clues, he's still adept to the most minute jigsaw pieces. With socializing, he's still quite the bumbler that doesn't get a hint very well.The sad thing is that, in Hounds of Baskerville, the screenwriters apparently decided to hold back on what is considered Sherlock's most famous non-trademark statement, a comment about dogs not barking. And speaking of famous statements, it took me a while to figure out they don't have him say ""Elementary, my dear Watson,"" but just have say ""Obviously."" Just as snarky as the current generation of youngsters, unfortunately.Now it's the third episode that goes above and beyond the normal standards of today's detective genre. As well as has the best quote in the season, about how Sherlock works for the side of angels, yet is not one.

Where Season 1 dealt with the demons behind the duo (Holmes and Watson), Season 2 has a handful of totally weird and wonderful criminals and Holmes dealing with his new-found fame. Where his website and ""243 kinds of tobacco ash"" failed to grab public attention, John Watson's blog gets thousands of hits a day and has turned Holmes into a tabloid darling, much to his dismay. The unfortunate photo where he's disguised in a theatre prop hat (the Deerstalker, of course) comes back to vex him as well.The end episode is very Batman-like, but that is ok. Moriarty and Holmes are larger-than-life figures so a bit of cartoonish writing is all right--though I think the silliness in Season 2 sometimes gets out of hand (going trouser-less in Buckingham Palace?) I found the cartoonish quality detracted a bit from the sympathy and attraction we feel for Holmes and Watson, but only a little.

Sex and violence are not merely added incentives, but rather driving forces in the &#34;CSIs&#34; and &#34;Law and Orders.&#34; I enjoy mysteries where the main protagonist is far smarter than I will ever be. I like to be impressed by the intelligence of the writers and the characters. The American retailing of Sherlock Holmes, &#34;Elementary,&#34; is a good show. I particularly like the reinvisioning of the Dr. Watson role to a smarter, more integral role. However, it still falls prey to the pitfalls of other American mystery shows.&#34;Sherlock&#34; however, is a sheer delight. It is excellently told with wonderfully caste actors. I have developed a bit of a man-crush on Benedict Cumberbatch. I am looking forward to his role as the villain in the new &#34;Star Trek.&#34; I cannot recommend this series enough. It is intelligent,  exciting, and well acted. More importantly, this show uses the original Holmes stories as templates for its scripts.

1425274,AZC562U18BK2S,B004QOB8SO,J. R. Trtek,"[1, 2]","My initial reaction to this series was decidedly mixed, for while I could appreciate the utterly brilliant manner in which the characters have been updated to the 21st Century, I felt that to a large extent the characters themselves had been transformed too much, so they really weren't modern equivalents of the canonical Holmes, Watson, etc., but rather new ones using the old names. As it has continued into a second season, however, Sherlock has to my mind pulled back from that error, though just a tad -- Holmes, to my taste, still comes off as rather too immature and heedless of others. Still, any stretch of, say, ten minutes in this series is usually a delight to witness. The repartee is marvelous, the fit of the ensemble together quite wonderful, and the additional tics and touches applied just right. The huge problem for me, however, is that the stories are altogether horrible: Muddled, disjointed, stretching credulity, and -- fatally for anything involving Sherlock Holmes -- illogical. The best example in this set is &#34;The Hounds of Baskerville.&#34; I don't want to strew spoilers, so I won't be specific, but this story includes convenient lapses in security, unexplained generosity by the villain, unexplained incongruities, and more. Looking back on it, I find that most of the story simply makes little or no sense. So in the end, for me, it depends on how much I value plot as well as character, and the fact is that I do. I've come round to accepting and even becoming fond of the revamped characters, and I've always appreciated the wit and invention of the series. Judging on those qualities alone, I'd give this five stars, period. The bad storytelling, however, bump it down to 3.5 stars for me. I'm going to record four, out of love for the characters, but if you are a Holmes purist and/or a stickler for a good plot, consider it to really be a three.",4,Brilliant Adaptation Marred by Truly Bad Stories,1392422400,"02 15, 2014",2014,1888,"['initial', 'reaction', 'series', 'was', 'decidedly', 'mixed', 'could', 'appreciate', 'utterly', 'brilliant', 'manner', 'characters', 'have', 'been', 'updated', '21st', 'Century', 'felt', 'large', 'extent', 'characters', 'had', 'been', 'transformed', 'too', 'much', 'really', 'were', ""n't"", 'modern', 'equivalents', 'canonical', 'Holmes', 'Watson', 'etc.', 'rather', 'new', 'ones', 'using', 'old', 'names', 'continued', 'second', 'season', 'however', 'Sherlock', 'mind', 'pulled', 'back', 'error', 'though', 'just', 'tad', 'Holmes', 'taste', 'still', 'off', 'rather', 'too', 'immature', 'heedless', 'others', 'Still', 'stretch', 'say', 'ten', 'minutes', 'series', 'usually', 'delight', 'witness', 'repartee', 'marvelous', 'fit', 'ensemble', 'together', 'quite', 'wonderful', 'additional', 'tics', 'touches', 'applied', 'just', 'right', 'huge', 'problem', 'however', 'stories', 'are', 'altogether', 'horrible', 'Muddled', 'disjointed', 'stretching', 'credulity', 'fatally', 'anything', 'involving', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'illogical', 'best', 'example', 'set', '34', 'Hounds', 'Baskerville.', '34', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'strew', 'spoilers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'specific', 'story', 'convenient', 'lapses', 'security', 'unexplained', 'generosity', 'villain', 'unexplained', 'incongruities', 'more', 'Looking', 'back', 'find', 'most', 'story', 'simply', 'little', 'sense', 'So', 'end', 'how', 'much', 'value', 'plot', 'as', 'well', 'character', 'fact', 'do', ""'ve"", 'come', 'round', 'accepting', 'even', 'becoming', 'fond', 'revamped', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'always', 'appreciated', 'wit', 'invention', 'series', 'Judging', 'qualities', 'alone', ""'d"", 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'period', 'bad', 'storytelling', 'however', '3.5', 'stars', ""'m"", 'going', 'record', 'four', 'love', 'characters', 'are', 'Holmes', 'purist', 'and/or', 'stickler', 'good', 'plot', 'consider', 'really', 'be', 'three']",Sherlock: Season 2

1425282,AYVQMWDUSGL2C,B004QOB8SO,jude pepper,"[4, 4]","what can i say? it's the single most outlandish, questionable notion ever to ultimately pay off!!we Sherlockians tend hear much about what's supposedly essential. we're told, for instance, that it's utterly vital that it take place on the proverbial ""foggy night in Old London Town""...even though the only major fog Conan Doyle wrote, in THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, was way out in the country! we're told how he absolutely must wear that Inverness-and-deerstalker ensemble...even though Doyle had nothing to do with that; it was illustrator Sidney Paget's contribution. (and the focus of a priceless inside-joke, by the way.) we're told how absolutely imperative it is for something somewhere to be ""elementary my dear Watson""...despite the fact that that little catchphrase, on top of being rather onerous, technically sprang from Hollywood. well, looks like the Victorian England setting wasn't exactly mandatory, either.i don't expect SHERLOCK to put any of that persnicketty snobbishness to rest, but it should more than convince the open mind of the dangers of such snobbery. the truly preposterous notion of updating the Great Consulting Detective works because creators Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss knew which elements were indeed indispensible. (by the way, i'm sure i'll be accused of being biased toward the series by those who recognize Moffat as the current leader of my all-time favorite tv series, DOCTOR WHO. well, maybe, but i was just as much biased by the fact that Sherlock is my all-time favorite literary character.)ironically, Benedict Cumberbatch is not only a thoroughly faithfull portrayal of Our Hero, he may be the single most faithfull in years. one of Moffat's goals way to sidestep the cliche' of Sherlock and Dr. Watson being in their 40s or 50s and depict them as Doyle wrote them, young men when they met. this makes room for completely Canonical ideas and nuances that would be cancelled out if they were played by the usual middle-aged actors. we get to see the charactes develop, rather than act on the assumption that they were born into the characters we recognize and remember. THE HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE, for instance, features a poignant subplot in which Sherlock deals with his very first bout of doubt, confronts (ostensibly for the first time) the possibility that he is fallible. yu won't get that sort of thing from Rathbone and Bruce or Downey and Law. or even Brett and Burke/Hardwicke, really.the three stories as well are a bit outlandish...and quite compelling largely for that very reason. i'm not sure if it takes more imagination or gumption to turn Irene Adler into a dominatrix, or convert THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES from a haunted house story to a tale of an army base shrouded not in fog but conspiracy theroies. as for No. 3, which i was particulrly looking forward to because it's based on one of my very favorite adventures, ""The Final Problem,"" it's embellishments actually managed to add a degree of dimension (not least of which via Moriarty's convoluted schem to discredit Our Hero). i must admit that i wasn't sure about actor Andrew Scott and his exaggerated ""homo"" take on the Napoleon Of Crime...but i have to admit that he ultimately creeps me out and then some.(as it happens, the DVD of SHERLOCK HOLMES: A GAME OF SHADOWS finally turned up just before i wrote this. check out Jared Harris' more conventional Moriarty as well as Scott's hammed-up version, and tell me if you'd like to meet either down the proverbial dark alley on the proverbial dark night.)one of my favorite lines from a Sherlock movie is, ironically, from the parody WITHOUT A CLUE. the plot concerns a Watson who is himself a crime-solving wizard, but who, for fear of how it might reflect on his professional standing, created a fictional cipher to take the credit. the ploy backfired, and public interest in this Sherlock Holmes ultimately led him to hire a drunken, out-of-work actor to portray his creation. early in the film, after a spat and subsequent separation, ""Holmes"" chides Watson: ""you might've created me, but now Sherlock Holmes belongs to the world."" that could well be the single most succinct description for art in general that i've ever heard. (well, successful art, anyway.)SHERLOCK neatly exeplifies what the world can do with the art it owns, provided it's handled by owners who understand it, appreciate it, LOVE it. and so does WITHOUT A CLUE, for that matter.",5,TIMELESS IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE...,1339545600,"06 13, 2012",2012,4434,"['what', 'can', 'i', 'say', 'single', 'most', 'outlandish', 'questionable', 'notion', 'ever', 'ultimately', 'pay', 'off', 'Sherlockians', 'tend', 'hear', 'much', 'what', 'supposedly', 'essential', ""'re"", 'told', 'instance', 'utterly', 'vital', 'take', 'place', 'proverbial', 'foggy', 'night', 'Old', 'London', 'Town', 'even', 'only', 'major', 'fog', 'Conan', 'Doyle', 'wrote', 'THE', 'HOUND', 'THE', 'BASKERVILLES', 'was', 'way', 'country', ""'re"", 'told', 'how', 'absolutely', 'must', 'wear', 'Inverness-and-deerstalker', 'ensemble', 'even', 'Doyle', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'was', 'illustrator', 'Sidney', 'Paget', 'contribution', 'focus', 'priceless', 'inside-joke', 'way', ""'re"", 'told', 'how', 'absolutely', 'imperative', 'something', 'somewhere', 'be', 'elementary', 'dear', 'Watson', 'fact', 'little', 'catchphrase', 'top', 'being', 'rather', 'onerous', 'technically', 'sprang', 'Hollywood', 'well', 'Victorian', 'England', 'setting', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'mandatory', 'either.i', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'SHERLOCK', 'put', 'persnicketty', 'snobbishness', 'rest', 'should', 'more', 'convince', 'open', 'mind', 'dangers', 'such', 'snobbery', 'truly', 'preposterous', 'notion', 'updating', 'Great', 'Consulting', 'Detective', 'works', 'creators', 'Steven', 'Moffat', 'Mark', 'Gatiss', 'knew', 'elements', 'were', 'indeed', 'indispensible', 'way', 'i', ""'m"", 'sure', 'i', ""'ll"", 'be', 'accused', 'being', 'biased', 'series', 'who', 'recognize', 'Moffat', 'current', 'leader', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'tv', 'series', 'DOCTOR', 'WHO', 'well', 'maybe', 'i', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'biased', 'fact', 'Sherlock', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'literary', 'character', 'ironically', 'Benedict', 'Cumberbatch', 'not', 'only', 'thoroughly', 'faithfull', 'portrayal', 'Hero', 'may', 'be', 'single', 'most', 'faithfull', 'years', 'one', 'Moffat', 'goals', 'way', 'sidestep', 'cliche', 'Sherlock', 'Dr.', 'Watson', 'being', '40s', '50s', 'depict', 'Doyle', 'wrote', 'young', 'men', 'when', 'met', 'room', 'completely', 'Canonical', 'ideas', 'nuances', 'would', 'be', 'cancelled', 'out', 'were', 'played', 'usual', 'middle-aged', 'actors', 'get', 'see', 'charactes', 'develop', 'rather', 'act', 'assumption', 'were', 'born', 'characters', 'recognize', 'remember', 'HOUNDS', 'OF', 'BASKERVILLE', 'instance', 'poignant', 'subplot', 'Sherlock', 'deals', 'very', 'first', 'bout', 'doubt', 'confronts', 'ostensibly', 'first', 'time', 'possibility', 'fallible', 'yu', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'sort', 'thing', 'Rathbone', 'Bruce', 'Downey', 'Law', 'even', 'Brett', 'Burke/Hardwicke', 'really.the', 'three', 'stories', 'well', 'are', 'bit', 'outlandish', 'quite', 'compelling', 'largely', 'very', 'reason', 'i', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'more', 'imagination', 'gumption', 'turn', 'Irene', 'Adler', 'dominatrix', 'convert', 'THE', 'HOUND', 'THE', 'BASKERVILLES', 'haunted', 'house', 'story', 'tale', 'army', 'base', 'shrouded', 'not', 'fog', 'conspiracy', 'theroies', 'No', '3', 'i', 'was', 'particulrly', 'looking', 'forward', 'based', 'one', 'very', 'favorite', 'adventures', 'Final', 'Problem', 'embellishments', 'actually', 'managed', 'add', 'degree', 'dimension', 'not', 'least', 'Moriarty', 'convoluted', 'schem', 'discredit', 'Hero', 'i', 'must', 'admit', 'i', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'actor', 'Andrew', 'Scott', 'exaggerated', 'homo', 'take', 'Napoleon', 'Crime', 'i', 'have', 'admit', 'ultimately', 'creeps', 'then', 'DVD', 'SHERLOCK', 'HOLMES', 'GAME', 'OF', 'SHADOWS', 'finally', 'turned', 'up', 'just', 'i', 'wrote', 'check', 'out', 'Jared', 'Harris', 'more', 'conventional', 'Moriarty', 'as', 'well', 'Scott', 'hammed-up', 'version', 'tell', ""'d"", 'like', 'meet', 'down', 'proverbial', 'dark', 'alley', 'proverbial', 'dark', 'night', 'one', 'favorite', 'lines', 'Sherlock', 'movie', 'ironically', 'parody', 'CLUE', 'plot', 'Watson', 'who', 'crime-solving', 'wizard', 'who', 'fear', 'how', 'might', 'reflect', 'professional', 'standing', 'created', 'fictional', 'cipher', 'take', 'credit', 'ploy', 'backfired', 'public', 'interest', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'ultimately', 'led', 'hire', 'drunken', 'out-of-work', 'actor', 'portray', 'creation', 'early', 'film', 'spat', 'subsequent', 'separation', 'Holmes', 'Watson', 'might', ""'ve"", 'created', 'now', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'world', 'could', 'well', 'be', 'single', 'most', 'succinct', 'description', 'art', 'general', 'i', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'well', 'successful', 'art', 'anyway', 'SHERLOCK', 'neatly', 'what', 'world', 'can', 'do', 'art', 'provided', 'handled', 'owners', 'who', 'understand', 'appreciate', 'so', 'WITHOUT', 'A', 'CLUE', 'matter']",Sherlock: Season 2

It scared the ""Dickens"" out of me and replaced it with ""Doyle."" It wasn't long before I had my own set of Doyle's complete Holmes' stories. That was over forty years ago. That set wore out over the years and has been twice replaced.So you can imagine how happy I was as an adult to spot Jeremy Brett as Sherlock. YES! I thought he couldn't be topped as the quintessential Holmes. I was wrong, yet I was right.Brett was perfect portraying the Victorian Holmes, but - bringing Sherlock into the 21st century?! How could they??!! They did. Boy, did they ever! Fifteen minutes into the first episode and I was hooked!Cumberbatch was magnificent. Watson was perfectly played by Martin Freeman [I'm waiting to see him as a Hobbit]. Mycroft was slickly proper and a bit spooky ... a very good foil for ""Hat Man and Robin"" as the press headlines called them in ""Scandal in Belgravia"" [Season 2 episode].Hubby liked Brett as Holmes every bit as much as I and was a bit leery of the new concept. The first episode aired on Masterpiece Theatre on PBS. I watched it alone. When episode 2 aired, hubby was right next to me. We never got to see the third episode until the DVD arrived. We watched the whole DVD the first night possible.  When Season Two became available on DVD, I snatched it up right quick.We hadn't seen a single episode of Season Two, but the titles were teasing.  Irene Adler? Who? How would they possibly update THE WOMAN? WOW! They did. 5 of 5 stars. The Hound? That rated a 4 of 5. Look out for Bluebell and the puns of Watson's re: other cases. Again, we are teased by the case of the aluminum crutch, referred to originally in ""The Musgrave Ritual."" Some day, someone will have to dig up Holmes notes and write about it.

1425298,AYPS4RCXEFSJP,B004QOB8SO,K. Boullosa,"[3, 3]","As a dedicated Baker Street Irregular, I have usually hated ""adaptations"" and ""modernizations"" of Conan Doyle's marvelous creation.  I tuned into Season One of this latest effort to bring Holmes & Watson into the 21st century and found myself, for once, utterly charmed.  Each of the episodes in both seasons is ""based upon"" one of the original Holmes stories, and for the most part, the adaptations are sly and plausible; purists will find something to quibble about in each one, as I did, but the overall high enjoyability quotient provides sufficient compensation for a few violations.  Credit for the success here is shared between skilled writing and the very game cast, starting with Benedict Cumberbatch, giving us a slightly more youthful and tempestuous, excitable Sherlock than we are accustomed to seeing on film or imagining from Conan Doyle's stories. This Sherlock is not so much cool as, well, as he puts it himself, ""a high-functioning sociopath"". It is Cumberbatch's task to persuade us to take the journey at all, and he pulls it off through a combination of wit, nerve, sincerity, and effrontery.  He is ably supported by Martin Freeman (Bilbo Baggins in ""The Hobbit"") as Dr. Watson, who manages to maintain a distinct humanity while functioning as the central protagonist's foil.  Mycroft, Sherlock's brother, is cheerfully given a wider role and an opportunity to be somewhat less opaque than he is in Conan Doyle's stories - partly because, as you'll see if you watch the special feature program, he is played by Mark Gatiss, one of the original writers-creators of the show.Season Two gives us episodes based on ""A Scandal in Bohemia"", ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"", and ""The Reichenbach Falls"" - the latter was the story in which the exhausted Conan Doyle tried to kill off his creation so he could stop writing the stories; in the event, public outcry forced Conan Doyle to find a way to resurrect the Great Detective, and publish a new series of adventures.I see that some viewers were offended by the treatment of Irene Adler, the heroine of ""A Scandal in Bohemia"" (here, ""A Scandal in Belgravia"").  I found it rather delicious and, of course, it offers us the only glimpse we will ever have of Sherlock responding to a woman in any but an analytical way.In my opinion, the only real failure over both seasons was the very, very disappointing take on the best-known of all Holmes's adventures, ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"".  The Hound has been filmed on its own quite a few times, sometimes to better and sometimes to worse effect, and always properly located at the end of the Victorian era.  However, none of those attempts, and indeed not this attempt, have been able to capture adequately the thrilling twists and turns of the original story.  In the attempt seen here on Season Two of Sherlock, the writers have this time gone way too far afield, thrown in too many gimmicks, diluted the mysterious qualities of the story.  And as most other films of the story have, the writers here missed their opportunity to replicate the revelatory moment when Holmes puts his arm around the Jacobite trimmings worn by the debauched Sir Hugo Baskerville in his portrait at Baskerville Hall, and the face of Stapleton the naturalist springs out of the canvas - giving us the villain of the piece in a brilliant theatrical stroke. I have never seen a screen transfer of The Hound that was as satisfying as reading the story: perhaps it is just one of those works meant only to be seen in the mind's eye.The last episode of Season Two is very fraught - the baleful consulting criminal, Jim Moriarty, (Andrew Scott in a quirky yet menacing, and oddly youthful portrayal - this talented actor can also be seen in Season One of ""The Hour"" and in a ""Foyle's War"" episode), is mounting ever more vicious attempts to ruin Holmes, and seems to be pulling off some stunning coups in his persecution.  I was not happy with Moriarty's last action, as it seemed too far out of character for the world's greatest consulting criminal, but there, can't have everything . . .All in all, unless you are so die-hard a purist that imagining Sherlock using an I-Phone makes you break out in hives, this is a worthwhile modernization of Conan Doyle's fascinating consulting detective, and a worthy follow-up to Season One with the exception of ""The Hound"".As we all know that Holmes returned to life after his adventure on the edges of the Reichenbach Falls, and we are allowed to see him at the close of Season Two hovering out of sight of his mourners, we may hope that Season 3 is not too far behind. However, word has it that due to commitments to other ventures, including Peter Jackson's ""The Hobbit"" by the two stars (in addition to Freeman starring as Bilbo, Cumberbatch is appearing in the second and third installments as the voice of Smaug and as The Necromancer), Season 3 will not debut until, at least, fall 2013 or early 2014.  Quite a while to wait before we get to see the famous opening scene of ""The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"", as Holmes reappears suddenly before Dr. Watson who, for the first and last time in his life, passes out.",4,The Game is ON!,1358294400,"01 16, 2013",2013,5161,"['dedicated', 'Baker', 'Street', 'Irregular', 'have', 'usually', 'hated', 'adaptations', 'modernizations', 'Conan', 'Doyle',

This second season shows us what happens when malign forces don't permit them to work. This season takes on complex villains, multinational plots, and forces the characters to behave in ways so unexpected they appear downright shocking. The three feature-length stories take pleasure in pushing the characters right up to the breaking point.As before, these three feature-length mysteries, driven by character rather than plot, start with the story we know, but turn it ninety degrees from our expectations. We think, when we see a title like ""The Hounds of Baskerville,"" that we know what we are about to see; and we're partly right. But Moffett and Gatiss succeed in this series most profoundly because they don't simply retell Doyle's classic stories they renew them.I especially appreciate the fact that the story never stops feeling like an ascent. We never reach a point where I feel like the story has hit a plateau so the writers or actors can do some virtuoso display and show off for us. Every moment matters, sometimes in ways we can't initially see. And because every moment matters, the entire series builds to a cliffhanger conclusion so intricate that I can't see how they will resolve it. Yet.With a story this well beloved, it would be easy for the creative team so shrug their way through, especially since Moffett and Gatiss have their fingers in another wildly successful franchise.

This is probably not the way it was intended to be seen. That being said, I enjoyed season 2 more than Season 1.  The only episode I didn't enjoy at all was the second one, 'The Hound of the Baskervilles, ' which in my opinion, was truly terrible.  They were trying for a completely non-supernatural, modern-science update of the classic Sherlock Holmes story, and it just didn't come off.  Not even watching Sherlock have an emotional freak-out moment could save this episode....it was more disturbing than revealing, a waste of a good Benedict Cumberbatch performance (now that's criminal!) Watson was wasted there also, and that's doubly bad, because the Watson in this update of Sherlock Holmes' adventures is far more interesting, much more of a partner.  I was getting truly tired of having it repeatedly shown that Watson's lovelife is awful, thanks in part to his association with Sherlock, in that episode.  But enough of Episode 2.  In Season 2 we also find out a lot more about Mycroft Holmes, who's more complex and interesting, than I could have imagined Mycroft to be. That was a pleasant surprise.  We meet him again in Episode 1 and in 3.  The third episode was very difficult to watch, very intense, very well done....except for the end, which was completely predictable.  The first episode, 'A Scandal in Belgravia', was really good, except for the end (again!), which was IMHO, just stupid.  I liked the twist on Irene Adler's character (forgive the pun), and I love plot elements that are different/fresh/innovative, so this one was definitely fun to watch.  But I just hate it when the end isn't as interesting as the beginning, because that's what keeps you coming back.

The surprise continues to surprise. In Season 2, three classic Sherlock stories are updated and tweaked to fit modern times.1. A Scandal in Belgravia, 2. The Hounds of Baskerville and 3. The Reichenbach Fall are the three stories brought to life and color. In A Scandal in Belgravia, the dominatrix Irene Adler is introduced. Is she the perfect woman for Sherlock? Will her feminine wiles beguile him and make him lose his senses and mind? Loved the ending in this one. There is an adult theme, with the cracking of Adler's whip, so remove small children and animals from the room.In The Hounds of the Baskerville, Sherlock's most famous mystery, the plot is really toyed with. This one is the most terrifying of the three stories. Finally, The Reichenbach Fall, Sherlock meets Moriarty head on in mind-to-mind combat. Who will triumph? The ending will have you brainstorming different hypotheses for what really happened, how did they do that, and what will happen next, making you wistful regarding having to wait a year to find out. I wonder if we'll see Moriarty in Season III...Really, the writers/producers need to produce more shows each season. Three are not enough. How about five or seven shows, as in DOWNTON ABBEY? You can still have a little quantity without sacrificing quality.This second series makes you like this enactment of Dr. Watson even more and Sherlock seems to be softening, becoming more vulnerable emotionally and humane, before your very eyes.

1425352,A2VF25F0XZHXMW,B004QOB8SO,London Fog,"[28, 55]","While I hate lowering my rating of such an otherwise excellent production to 3 stars, Sherlock's sophomore effort was beleagured with fundamental problems too numerous and glaring to be overlooked. There were serious weaknesses pertaining to characterization, plot continuity, and gratuitous amounts of fan service inserted to such an extent as to negatively effect the cleverness, intellectual integrity,character portrayals, and scripting that contributed to making series 1 so outstanding.The blame, I am sorry to say, lies squarely on the shoulders of Steven Moffat for distorting so thoroughly every element that comprised the first episode, 'A Scandal In Belgravia'. About 60% of the way through ASiB, I honestly had to wonder what on earth was this garbled, puerile nonsense I was watching, and more importantly, what did it have to do with Sherlock Holmes? The episode seemed nothing but a poorly written work of fan fiction and some James Bond/Dr Who-esque conglomeration.That aside, the travesty that was episode one began with the cliffhanger ""resolution"", which was utterly ridiculous, a complete cop out, and left us with several glaring loose ends and outright plot holes. Disappointing as it was, I was eager to forgive this because, well, series 2 was here (!). But the already weak episode went downhill the moment Irene Adler's character stepped on screen. No, I don't care a whit she was made into a lesbian dominatrix. I was actually excited about the prospect as I thought that was inserted to prevent her from being viewed as some love interest, which she most decidedly was NOT in Canon. But oh, how wrong I was to be proven...There was not even an attempt made at presenting her as the clever woman of Doyle's stories, the only woman to ever outwit Holmes, who forced the misogynistic detective to rethink his stance on a female's wit. Here, there is no respect and admiration of Adler on Sherlock's part, as Moffat's Adler does not use even one brain cell throughout, and Sherlock is too busy having a sulk. Adler's cleverness is all smoke and mirrors, even going so far as making her into a damsel in distress at the end. The script quickly degrades to the point where nothing in this episode can be looked at as redeemable. It was cheapened into nothing but sexual tension, and was easily the most shallow, superficial take on the story ever achieved. Holmes' character was was so far beyond recognizable (NOT the fault of the estimable Benedict Cumberbatch, but of the script) it was actually painful to watch. I cringed at frequent intervals and was so put off by this episode, I was ready to abandon the series entirely.'The Hounds of Baskerville' and 'The Reichenbach Fall', however, were a vast improvement over Moffat's failed attempt, and were more than worthy of the series. The latter two writers successfully cleared away the clutter that could not be utilized in updating the original Canon stories, stripping plots down to the bare bones and giving us something engaging, well written and credible. More importantly, we see the characterizations click back into place despite profound liberties being taken with the stories themselves. Mark Gatiss is a phenomenal pastiche and horror writer, and I was excited to see how he drastically changed HOUN without sacrificing an iota of who the characters were, and gave us a genuinely frightening, engaging story in the process.And as poignantly acted and scripted as the final episode was, I think a vast amount of credit should go to Steve Thompson for two things. First, for taking the criticisms he received for The Blind Banker and using them to improve his craft and giving us what could be the finest episode to date, both characterization and scripting wise. Secondly, for taking Molly, a character created by the disgustingly misogynistic Steven Moffat (who should truly be kept from writing any female characters ever again, god spare us all) and turned her into a phenomenal entity in her brief but instrumental scenes. Well done, sir. In fact, it was the efforts of the latter two writers and the outstanding performances of both Cumberbatch & Freeman who brought Sherlock Holmes and Dr John Watson to life that entirely redeemed this programme for me. And while ASiB unfortunately did force me to lower my overall rating, it's worth mentioning that the THOB and TRF are well deserving of five stars apiece.",3,Decrease In Quality Over Series 1,1333756800,"04 7, 2012",2012,4402,"['hate', 'lowering', 'rating', 'such', 'otherwise', 'excellent', 'production', '3', 'stars', 'Sherlock', 'sophomore', 'effort', 'was', 'beleagured', 'fundamental', 'problems', 'too', 'numerous', 'glaring', 'be', 'overlooked', 'were', 'serious', 'weaknesses', 'pertaining', 'characterization', 'plot', 'continuity', 'gratuitous', 'amounts', 'fan', 'service', 'inserted', 'extent', 'negatively', 'effect', 'cleverness', 'intellectual', 'integrity', 'character', 'portrayals', 'scripting', 'contributed', 'making', 'series', '1', 'outstanding.The', 'blame', 'am', 'sorry', 'say', 'squarely', 'shoulders', 'Steven', 'Moffat', 'distorting', 'so', 'thoroughly', 'element', 'comprised', 'first', 'episode', 'Scandal', 'Belgravia', '60', '%', 'way', 'ASiB', 'honestly', 'had', 'wonder', 'what', 'earth', 'was', 'garbled', 'nonsense', 'was', 'watching', 'more', 'importantly', 'what', 'did', 'have', 'do', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'episode', 'seemed', 'nothing', 'poorly', 'written', 'work', 'fan', 'fiction', 'James', 'Bond/Dr', 'Who-esque', 'conglomeration.That', 'aside', 'travesty', 'was', 'episode', 'one', 'began', 'cliffhanger', 'resolution', 'was', 'utterly', 'ridiculous', 'complete', 'cop', 'left', 'several', 'glaring', 'loose', 'ends', 'outright', 'plot', 'holes', 'Disappointing', 'was', 'was', 'eager', 'forgive', 'because', 'well', 'series', '2', 'was', 'here', 'already', 'weak', 'episode', 'went', 'moment', 'Irene', 'Adler', 'character', 'stepped', 'screen', 'No', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'whit', 'was', 'made', 'lesbian', 'dominatrix', 'was', 'actually', 'excited', 'prospect', 'thought', 'was', 'inserted', 'prevent', 'being', 'viewed', 'love', 'interest', 'most', 'decidedly', 'was', 'NOT', 'Canon', 'oh', 'how', 'wrong', 'was', 'be', 'proven', 'was', 'not', 'even', 'attempt', 'made', 'presenting', 'clever', 'woman', 'Doyle', 'stories', 'only', 'woman', 'ever', 'outwit', 'Holmes', 'who', 'forced', 'misogynistic', 'detective', 'rethink', 'stance', 'female', 'wit', 'Here', 'respect', 'admiration', 'Adler', 'Sherlock', 'part', 'Moffat', 'Adler', 'not', 'use', 'even', 'one', 'brain', 'cell', 'Sherlock', 'too', 'busy', 'having', 'sulk', 'Adler', 'cleverness', 'smoke', 'mirrors', 'even', 'going', 'so', 'far', 'making', 'damsel', 'distress', 'end', 'script', 'quickly', 'point', 'where', 'nothing', 'episode', 'can', 'be', 'looked', 'redeemable', 'was', 'cheapened', 'nothing', 'sexual', 'tension', 'was', 'easily', 'most', 'shallow', 'superficial', 'take', 'story', 'ever', 'achieved', 'Holmes', 'character', 'was', 'was', 'so', 'far', 'recognizable', 'NOT', 'fault', 'estimable', 'Benedict', 'Cumberbatch', 'script', 'was', 'actually', 'painful', 'watch', 'cringed', 'frequent', 'intervals', 'was', 'so', 'put', 'off', 'episode', 'was', 'ready', 'abandon', 'series', 'entirely', ""'The"", 'Hounds', 'Baskerville', 'Reichenbach', 'Fall', 'however', 'were', 'vast', 'improvement', 'Moffat', 'failed', 'attempt', 'were', 'more', 'worthy', 'series', 'latter', 'two', 'writers', 'successfully', 'cleared', 'away', 'clutter', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'utilized', 'updating', 'original', 'Canon', 'stories', 'stripping', 'plots', 'down', 'bare', 'bones', 'giving', 'something', 'engaging', 'well', 'written', 'credible', 'More', 'importantly', 'see', 'characterizations', 'click', 'back', 'place', 'profound', 'liberties', 'being', 'taken', 'stories', 'Mark', 'Gatiss', 'phenomenal', 'pastiche', 'horror', 'writer', 'was', 'excited', 'see', 'how', 'drastically', 'changed', 'HOUN', 'sacrificing', 'iota', 'who', 'characters', 'were', 'gave', 'genuinely', 'frightening', 'engaging', 'story', 'process.And', 'poignantly', 'acted', 'scripted', 'final', 'episode', 'was', 'think', 'vast', 'amount', 'credit', 'should', 'go', 'Steve', 'Thompson', 'two', 'things', 'First', 'taking', 'criticisms', 'received', 'Blind', 'Banker', 'using', 'improve', 'craft', 'giving', 'could', 'be', 'finest', 'episode', 'date', 'characterization', 'scripting', 'wise', 'Secondly', 'taking', 'Molly', 'character', 'created', 'disgustingly', 'misogynistic', 'Steven', 'Moffat', 'who', 'should', 'truly', 'be', 'kept', 'writing', 'female', 'characters', 'ever', 'again', 'god', 'spare', 'turned', 'phenomenal', 'entity', 'brief', 'instrumental', 'scenes', 'Well', 'done', 'sir', 'fact', 'was', 'efforts', 'latter', 'two', 'writers', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'Cumberbatch', 'Freeman', 'who', 'brought', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'Dr', 'John', 'Watson', 'life', 'entirely', 'redeemed', 'programme', 'ASiB', 'unfortunately', 'did', 'force', 'lower', 'overall', 'rating', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'THOB', 'TRF', 'are', 'well', 'deserving', 'five', 'stars', 'apiece']",Sherlock: Season 2
1425353,A2R5CSZETTPU9R,B004QOB8SO,LondonWriter,"[0, 1]","Unfortunately, I couldn't get a rating between 3 stars and 4. However, let me tell you the pros and cons to this series. Let's start with the positive aspects. First of all Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman are the only ones who could do this role so perfectly. I can't imagine anyone better for taking on the personas and executing the witty lines. Second of all, and I already briefly touched on this, it is full of wit. Holmes, ever the more superior mind, constantly tells people to shut up because of their lack of intelligence with such lines as &#34;be quiet because you're lowering the IQ of the whole street.&#34;  Then there's the technology. If anyone has ever seen the version with Jeremy Brett, you'll remember that it was good but obviously set in the proper Sherlock time period according to the books. However, with the modernization contained in this series comes the inevitable technology which makes it really cool. The effects are great, particularly when Sherlock is looking someone over and little words appear next to their eyes or nose or clothing that tell exactly what Sherlock is deducing. Brilliant!Now, let me tell you about the negative aspects. It is most certainly not a kid-friendly show. This is displayed nowhere better than in the episode titled &#34;Scandal In Belgravia.&#34; &#34;The Woman&#34; as she is referred to by Sherlock, at least in the books, appears several times without any clothes on and there are several inappropriate lines that are scattered throughout the episode. However, the less than appropriate language doesn't stop there. Other episodes contain it too. Lastly, and I know this is just all part of who Sherlock Holmes is in this series, he is so egotistical. He knows he has superior intelligence and relishes the opportunity to rub it in everyone's face. It's not subtle either. He literally calls people stupid in so many words numerous times and it's obvious that he thinks himself better than everyone else. But yes, clearly he is smarter than all of the rest of mankind. If you watch the version with Jeremy Brett, you'll see that Holmes not only never rubs his superior intelligence in people's faces but also quite often lets Lestrade take all the credit for a case he solved himself. He is a much more humble man. But I guess if you did everything according to the books, there would be no point in ever redoing it.",4,Imaginative Though Slightly Innapropriate,1388707200,"01 3, 2014",2014,2392,"['Unfortunately', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'rating', '3', 'stars', '4', 'However', 'let', 'tell', 'pros', 'cons', 'series', 'Let', 'start', 'positive', 'aspects', 'First', 'Benedict', 'Cumberbatch', 'Martin', 'Freeman', 'are', 'only', 'ones', 'who', 'could', 'do', 'role', 'so', 'perfectly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'anyone', 'better', 'taking', 'personas', 'executing', 'witty', 'lines', 'Second', 'already', 'briefly', 'touched', 'full', 'wit', 'Holmes', 'ever', 'more', 'superior', 'mind', 'constantly', 'people', 'shut', 'up', 'lack', 'intelligence', 'such', 'lines', '34', 'be', 'quiet', ""'re"", 'lowering', 'IQ', 'whole', 'street.', '34', 'Then', 'technology', 'anyone', 'ever', 'seen', 'version', 'Jeremy', 'Brett', ""'ll"", 'remember', 'was', 'good', 'obviously', 'set', 'proper', 'Sherlock', 'time', 'period', 'according', 'books', 'However', 'modernization', 'contained', 'series', 'inevitable', 'technology', 'really', 'cool', 'effects', 'are', 'great', 'particularly', 'when', 'Sherlock', 'looking', 'someone', 'little', 'words', 'appear', 'eyes', 'nose', 'clothing', 'tell', 'exactly', 'what', 'Sherlock', 'deducing', 'Brilliant', 'Now', 'let', 'tell', 'negative', 'aspects', 'most', 'certainly', 'not', 'kid-friendly', 'show', 'displayed', 'nowhere', 'better', 'episode', 'titled', '34', 'Scandal', 'Belgravia.', '34', '34', 'Woman', '34', 'referred', 'Sherlock', 'least', 'books', 'several', 'times', 'clothes', 'are', 'several', 'inappropriate', 'lines', 'are', 'scattered', 'episode', 'However', 'less', 'appropriate', 'language', ""n't"", 'stop', 'there', 'Other', 'episodes', 'contain', 'too', 'Lastly', 'know', 'just', 'part', 'who', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'series', 'so', 'egotistical', 'superior', 'intelligence', 'opportunity', 'rub', 'everyone', 'face', 'not', 'subtle', 'either', 'literally', 'people', 'stupid', 'so', 'many', 'words', 'numerous', 'times', 'obvious', 'better', 'everyone', 'else', 'yes', 'clearly', 'smarter', 'rest', 'mankind', 'watch', 'version', 'Jeremy', 'Brett', ""'ll"", 'see', 'Holmes', 'not', 'only', 'never', 'rubs', 'superior', 'intelligence', 'people', 'also', 'quite', 'often', 'Lestrade', 'take', 'credit', 'case', 'solved', 'much', 'more', 'humble', 'man', 'guess', 'did', 'everything', 'according', 'books', 'would', 'be', 'point', 'ever', 'redoing']",Sherlock: Season 2

I was disappointed at the choice of Downey Jr. and Law playing in the movies, I think it's a mistake and those movies are a complete mess. Cumberbatch shows what refined acting can do with this material! He is an extremely talented actor, I can't praise him enough! He brings depth, intelligence and enough quirky humor to make it watching him such a delight!!!Same to be said about Martin Freeman, his low keyed fine acting brings dimension to Dr. Watson( BTW thank you writing team for not emasculating Dr. Watson as Nigel Bruce did!) The 2 of them together are priceless!I do have to add few words about Moriarty! I know things have been said about the Scandal in Belgravia episode for good reasons! But my favorite is The Reichenbach fall, the writing there is terrific and the duel between Sherlock and Moriarty is such a magnificent piece of acting! Andrew Scott is fantastic!!! You cannot imagine a scarier Moriarty, the blank stare and the aloofness,a chilling depiction of a modern terrorist!The series benefits from a great supporting cast :Rupert Graves, Gatiss himself, Una Stubbs,to name just a few, is fast paced and looks like slick advertising for London!The team Steven Moffat-Mark Gatiss does an incredible job in reinventing the character, making him modern and sexy, and being reverent to the books at the same time!

The creators' ideas put unique spins on the show while still remaining in line with Conan's intent.

The character of Sherlock is fascinating and well-played; the humor is sly and surprising; the scenery and sets are gorgeous.  Certain parts--especially the scene at Buckingham Palace and the cunning sequence between the Irene Adler's living room and the moor--stand out for their amazing photography, while the rooftop/phone call/season ending was so tense and heart-wrenching it held me spellbound.  I had to watch it twice.As usual, the characters are fun and compelling--I especially enjoy dear Mrs. Hudson and sweet, sweet Molly; while the normal, ""mundane"" but enjoyable characters of John and Lestrade nicely balance Sherlock's quirkiness.  The partnership between Sherlock Holmes and Watson was even more evident this season; each of them had to frequently give up something...time, trust, and more...to keep their friendship going.  Both John and Sherlock make each other angry from time to time, but in the end (literally), John remains unshakably loyal and Sherlock turns from his philosophy (""Alone protects me"") to adopt John's (""Nope: Friends protect people"").Every second of this series is utterly enjoyable, and is without a doubt my favorite British show ever.

If there is a true star of the series, I would ask you to consider Martin Freeman as the nothing-left-to-lose, PTSD-afflicted Dr. Watson as being it.The writing, production, and photography deserve a serious mention, since the time/effort alone of designing and inserting the graphics that depict Holmes' thought proceseses had to be created in a way that it enhances, rather than intrudes on the scene. A deft touch in that detail alone, and the show has plenty of small choices that really work.The stories are well-adapted to modern realities. The one quibble I had on the updating was with the casting choice for Jim Moriarty, not in the writing for the character. I found the resulting on-screen appearance wholly un-menacing, which is apparently not a majority opinion since he won a BAFTA for his supporting role.

Saying more would be spoiling it.

We learned a lot about their character and personality in the first season, and as expected they remain true to their reimagined selves.The worst thing you could say is that this season is simply more of the same from last season.  Another way of looking at it is that the characters continue to develop but are consistent to who they were in the first season.  And the first season was terrific, so more of the same is, well, also terrific.  And some of the events are really shocking in this season.Generally I have been very impressed with the work of the BBC Cardiff (Wales), which has included the reimagined Doctor Who and its spinoff, Torchwood.

1425409,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B004QOB8SO,mirasreviews,"[2, 3]","""Sherlock""'s first season was an impressive update of the 19th century technology-and-deduction-obsessed detective to the era of internet and cell phones. Season 2 is even better. Season 1 was evidently conceived as 60-minute episodes that were expanded to 90 minutes with a lot of useless filler. The characters and situations were great, but the stories were sloppy, to the point of cringe-inducing at times. Writers Stephen Moffat and Mark Gatiss knew what format they were writing for this time, so they gives us enough meat to fill 90 minutes. I didn't feel that these episodes dragged or went off course at any time. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's stories ""A Scandal in Bohemia"", ""The Final Problem"", and novel ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" have been updated to ""A Scandal in Belgravia"", ""The Hounds of Baskerville"", and ""The Reichenbach Fall.""""The Hounds of Baskerville"" is the weakest of this trio, but Mark Gatiss has, to his credit, updated a story about a giant, glowing dog so it makes sense to a 21st century audience. And modern concerns about secret military experiments are a nice touch. ""A Scandal in Belgravia"" updates a fan favorite and does not disappoint. Scenes are often framed through windows or doors. ""The Richenbach Fall"" is the cliffhanger that left Holmes fans anxious in 1893. It looks like modern fans may also have a long wait to find out if there will be more. But fame in the modern world is very different than Victorian England. Watson's blog has made Holmes an ""internet phenomenon"". ""The press will turn, Sherlock. They always turn. And they'll turn on you,"" says Watson. Comments on modern journalism and paranoia about computer crimes are some of the updated themes. The episodes are:Holmes may have met his match in ""A Scandal in Belgravia"". He and Watson are whisked off to Buckingham Palace in the middle of a case by big brother Mycroft (Mark Gatiss). Some illustrious person in the government wants Holmes to locate some compromising photographs in the possession of a dominatrix named Irene Adler (Laura Pulver). Adler anticipates Holmes' involvement in the case and befuddles him at first. But a group of well-armed, ruthless Americans are also after the photos. Or is their interest in something else entirely? Adler's life seems to be in danger, and Holmes is unusually protective. But who is playing whom, and why? This is a clever episode with plenty of twists and turns, but making it hinge on a 4-character password that any computer could crack is beyond ridiculous.Holmes and Watson take on the seemingly supernatural in ""The Hounds of Baskerville"". Desperate for a case and a cigarette, Holmes listens to the tale of Henry Knight (Russell Tovey), who, as a young boy, witnessed an enormous dog kill his father on the moor near the town of Baskerville. Twenty years later, the giant hound on the moor is something of a legend among local conspiracy theorists, who believe it is related to animal experimentation done at a nearby top secret military base. Holmes sees a possible connection to a seemingly trivial case of a lost rabbit, so he and Watson are off to Baskerville, where big brother Mycroft sends DI Lestrade (Rupert Graves) to keep an eye on them. This story is still eccentric, but the writers have come up with a solution to the mystery of the demonic, glowing hound that is believable to a modern audience.Jim Moriarty (Andrew Scott) shows just how dangerous a nemesis he is ""The Riechenbach Fall"". He breaks into the vault containing the Crown Jewels at the Tower of London, the vault of the Bank of England, and Pentonville Prison simultaneously, apparently using some very clever lines of computer code. But why? He didn't steal anything. He has the British government, including Mycroft Holmes, terrified of him, and even Sherlock is perplexed and trepidatious. Moriarty says something about ""a final problem"" and promises, ""It's gonna start very soon, Sherlock. The Fall"". Moriarty is obviously insane, but that may mean that Sherlock Holmes won't be able to keep up with his brilliant but irrational mind. Unpredictable, fast-paced, with stabs at modern journalism, ego, and gullibility, this episode keeps the audience guessing and entertained.",5,Two Very Strong Episodes. Better Than First Season.

It actually picks up where the season one cliff hanger left off, with a laughably melodramatic arch villain in a ridiculous non-conclusion that leaves one baffled at how someone so bright as Holmes and combat savy as Watson could be so darn stupid. Fortunately it picks up very well after that with a new story line that essentially is a love story between Holmes and a dominatrix prostitute who has managed to acquire both government secrets and lewd photos of a royal princess obtained in a dominatrix lesbian session. Yes, this is the racy episode. The second is a modern reboot of the &#34;Hound...&#34; storyline involving a secret government lab that is playing around with animal genes which is okay, but like the first season (or series, as the Brits refer to them) the first episode is by far the best. When Holmes arch enemy later returns, things get notably melodramatic again. I'm not a Benedict Cumberbatch fan, and be warned, he does not play the character to be likable; in fact, one could say just the opposite: Holmes is cold and indifferent to the suffering of others, and seemingly asexual (although the whole series has sexual innuendos about two men, Holmes and Watson, living together, much to Watson's umbrage).",4,Maintains The Quality Of The First Series,1386979200,"12 14, 2013",2013,1447,"['series', 'set', 'modern', 'day', 'London', 'retain', 'feel', 'original', 'stories', 'one', 'notable', 'exception', 'instead', 'being', 'cocaine', 'addict', 'Sherlock', 'nicotine', 'addict', 'shudder', 'filthy', 'habit', 'actually', 'up', 'where', 'season', 'one', 'cliff', 'hanger', 'left', 'off', 'laughably', 'melodramatic', 'arch', 'villain', 'ridiculous', 'non-conclusion', 'one', 'baffled', 'how', 'someone', 'so', 'bright', 'Holmes', 'combat', 'savy', 'Watson', 'could', 'be', 'so', 'darn', 'stupid', 'Fortunately', 'up', 'very', 'well', 'new', 'story', 'line', 'essentially', 'love', 'story', 'Holmes', 'dominatrix', 'prostitute', 'who', 'managed', 'acquire', 'government', 'secrets', 'lewd', 'photos', 'royal', 'princess', 'obtained', 'dominatrix', 'lesbian', 'session', 'Yes', 'racy', 'episode', 'second', 'modern', 'reboot', '34', 'Hound', '34', 'storyline', 'involving', 'secret', 'government', 'lab', 'playing', 'animal', 'genes', 'okay', 'first', 'season', 'series', 'Brits', 'refer', 'first', 'episode', 'far', 'best', 'When', 'Holmes', 'arch', 'enemy', 'later', 'returns', 'things', 'get', 'notably', 'melodramatic', 'again', ""'m"", 'not', 'Benedict', 'Cumberbatch', 'fan', 'be', 'warned', 'not', 'play', 'character', 'be', 'likable', 'fact', 'one', 'could', 'say', 'just', 'opposite', 'Holmes', 'cold', 'indifferent', 'suffering', 'others', 'seemingly', 'asexual', 'whole', 'series', 'sexual', 'innuendos', 'two', 'men', 'Holmes', 'Watson', 'living', 'together', 'much', 'Watson', 'umbrage']",Sherlock: Season 2

With a rousing mystery to propel the action, the whole thing ends up being classically romantic in a satisfying &#34;old hollywood&#34; manner where the male and female leads only share a passion but never consummate the attraction (at least to the viewers eyes), which in no way diminishes the love story. It's probably the only type of love story Sherlock should ever be allowed to have.

It always seemed odd to me that the US government would extract tax money from free citizens so as to force them to watch television made for people in another country. But no matter, British TV dramas were good.British TV had a couple advantages then. First of all it seems that all British people are excellent actors in the same way that all Frenchmen are excellent cooks. Whoever called thgem a nation of shopkeepers got it wrong. They are a nation of character actors. The other advantage British TV used to have was that it always seemed to have particularly literate screenplays. For example I was very fond of 'Cadfael' and 'The Sandbaggers'. But these two series both suffered from technical deficiencies.British television at that time was made with both video and film equipment. So indoor scenes were shot on video tape and outdoor scenes were shot on film.  The gamma of film and the gamma of tape are quite different. So in any one episode of these series there would be very different 'looks' to each separate scene. It was distracting but in those days we watched TV on 20 inch cathode ray tube TVs. The picture was so small and fuzzy it didn't matter that much. But today, like millions of Americans, I watch TV on a nine foot wide projection screen in High Definition with Dolby 5.1 sound. Such a set up is brutal in revealing every technical flaw. I found that I can't watch old episodes of  those beloved British shows. It's just too painful.But suddenly we have a new and technically competent British TV. The Sherlock series is not only brilliantly written and acted but now looks good too.  The typical Sherlock episode is hardly different in technical competence from a feature film. Wonderful.I first saw Benedict Cumberbatch  in the mini-series 'To the Ends of the Earth'. The series was like Cumberbatch himself - fascinating abut unlikeable. First of all his name is odd. I always called him Heinrich Cummerbund. It was a long time before I could remember his name - I still can't spell it. Most American stars like Tom Cruise are extraordinarily good looking and work hard at being likeable. Cumberbatch is odd looking and interpersonally nearly detestable. You wouldn't want to spend an evening in the pub with him.Yet he is an excellent Sherlock Holmes. Maybe that's not so surprising.

The series is also quite humorous and tongue in cheek and some Holmes fans may not like that aspect, preferring the dedicated humorless version. I have liked most of the versions and particularly like this one because it is a good and a funny at times, adaptation of Holmes to the modern day.

1425536,A1QKZZM6TG7UC1,B004QOB8SO,S.J.,"[3, 3]","I discovered this gem of a television series after it had been shown on PBS but before they knew for sure a season 2 would exist. Like thousands of fans I waited, re-watching the three episodes in season 1 until everyone around wanted to kill me or break the discs, and hoping the next three would be worth the wait-hoping I would not be disappointed.I wasn't.These are three excellent episodes that stand among the best Sherlock Holmes tv/film adaptations I've seen (and I've seen quite a few). This is not, however, something to buy and buy the first later. This season picks up right at the end of the last season 1 episode and moves full steam ahead. First season was introduction, this is the three best stories in the Holmes canon, all with excellent writing, beautiful acting, and a wonderful modern twist.A Scandal in Belgravia: A modern retelling of A Scandal in Bohemia, we are once again introduced to Irene Adler-The Woman. She is not an actor however, nor is she a thief-as she is in the Guy Ritchie version. No, now we have a dominatrix who tries to bring everyone around her, Sherlock, Mycroft, etc. to their knees. The script, written by Steven Moffat, is full of the wonderful dialogue between Sherlock and John, as well as hilarious and character developing moments. One of my personal favorite parts is the furthering of the relationship between Sherlock and his landlady. Mrs. Hudson is awesome! The best scene, talked about in other reviews, takes place in Buckingham Palace with John pulled from a crime scene and Sherlock wrapped up only in a sheet. They might not act grown up: as John says, ""We solve crimes together, I blog about it, and he forgets to wear his pants-I wouldn't hold out too much hope."" But it held out a lot of hope for a great series.The Hounds of Baskerville: Another marvelous modern retelling, this time from Mark Gattis. Many attempts have been unable to catch the mood of the story, which is less of a mystery and more a Gothic horror. This, he did perfectly, transforming a Gothic horror into a near modern equivalent: conspiracy theories. Baskerville is a British military secret lab with all sorts of potential for wild and terrible experiments. Sherlock and John travel together, soon joined by Lestrade-once again played excellently by Rupert Graves. Here, Sherlock faces fear, true terror, for the first time with less the happy results. Wonderful evolutions of the series' groundbreaking use of text on the screen is used perfectly here to allow us access into Sherlock's 'mind palace'. A wonderful retelling that is much better than the previous seasons second episode.The Reichenbach Fall: The one we all waited for. And it did not disappoint. Both of the previous episodes had contained little teasers of Moriarty, as if he peeked from behind curtains just off-stage. Now, however, Andrew Scott is given free reign to bring his take on the consulting criminal to life, bigger, badder, and more insane than ever. We watch as he slowly unravels his plan, as everything slowly falls apart in front of us. The conclusion of the series left me weeping, as it did many others. A third season has been promised so all we can do is wait...again, though we now have six episodes instead of three to keep us company.This is one of the best series on television in any country with excellent acting by Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman-the best Holmes and Watson duo I've seen since Jeremy Brett and his two co-stars and Rathbone and Bruce. The writing, the cinematography that would be excellent in big budget films, and the wonderful blending of modern day with all that is essentially Holmes makes this a must have for fans of the great detective, British Mystery series, or simply great television.",5,Long awaited...and worth it!,1340236800,"06 21, 2012",2012,3756,"['discovered', 'gem', 'television', 'series', 'had', 'been', 'shown', 'PBS', 'knew', 'sure', 'season', '2', 'would', 'exist', 'thousands', 'fans', 'waited', 're-watching', 'three', 'episodes', 'season', '1', 'everyone', 'around', 'wanted', 'kill', 'break', 'discs', 'hoping', 'next', 'three', 'would', 'be', 'wait-hoping', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed.I', ""wasn't.These"", 'are', 'three', 'excellent', 'episodes', 'stand', 'best', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'tv/film', 'adaptations', ""'ve"", 'seen', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'quite', 'few', 'not', 'however', 'something', 'buy', 'buy', 'first', 'later', 'season', 'up', 'right', 'end', 'last', 'season', '1', 'episode', 'moves', 'full', 'steam', 'ahead', 'First', 'season', 'was', 'introduction', 'three', 'best', 'stories', 'Holmes', 'canon', 'excellent', 'writing', 'beautiful', 'acting', 'wonderful', 'modern', 'twist.A', 'Scandal', 'Belgravia', 'modern', 'retelling', 'A', 'Scandal', 'Bohemia', 'are', 'once', 'again', 'introduced', 'Irene', 'Adler-The', 'Woman', 'not', 'actor', 'however', 'thief-as', 'Guy', 'Ritchie', 'version', 'No', 'now', 'have', 'dominatrix', 'who', 'bring', 'everyone', 'Sherlock', 'Mycroft', 'etc', 'knees', 'script', 'written', 'Steven', 'Moffat', 'full', 'wonderful', 'dialogue', 'Sherlock', 'John', 'as', 'well', 'hilarious', 'character', 'developing', 'moments', 'One', 'personal', 'favorite', 'parts', 'furthering', 'relationship', 'Sherlock', 'landlady', 'Mrs.', 'Hudson', 'awesome', 'best', 'scene', 'talked', 'other', 'reviews', 'place', 'Buckingham', 'Palace', 'John', 'pulled', 'crime', 'scene', 'Sherlock', 'wrapped', 'up', 'only', 'sheet', 'might', 'not', 'act', 'grown', 'up', 'John', 'solve', 'crimes', 'together', 'blog', 'wear', 'pants-I', 'would', ""n't"", 'hold', 'out', 'too', 'much', 'hope', 'held', 'out', 'lot', 'hope', 'great', 'series.The', 'Hounds', 'Baskerville', 'marvelous', 'modern', 'retelling', 'time', 'Mark', 'Gattis', 'Many', 'attempts', 'have', 'been', 'unable', 'catch', 'mood', 'story', 'less', 'mystery', 'more', 'Gothic', 'horror', 'did', 'perfectly', 'transforming', 'Gothic', 'horror', 'near', 'modern', 'equivalent', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'Baskerville', 'British', 'military', 'secret', 'lab', 'sorts', 'potential', 'wild', 'terrible', 'experiments', 'Sherlock', 'John', 'travel', 'together', 'soon', 'joined', 'Lestrade-once', 'again', 'played', 'excellently', 'Rupert', 'Graves', 'Here', 'Sherlock', 'fear', 'true', 'terror', 'first', 'time', 'less', 'happy', 'results', 'Wonderful', 'evolutions', 'series', 'groundbreaking', 'use', 'text', 'screen', 'used', 'perfectly', 'here', 'allow', 'access', 'Sherlock', 'palace', 'wonderful', 'retelling', 'much', 'better', 'previous', 'seasons', 'second', 'episode.The', 'Reichenbach', 'Fall', 'one', 'waited', 'did', 'not', 'disappoint', 'previous', 'episodes', 'had', 'contained', 'little', 'teasers', 'Moriarty', 'peeked', 'curtains', 'just', 'off-stage', 'Now', 'however', 'Andrew', 'Scott', 'given', 'free', 'reign', 'bring', 'take', 'consulting', 'criminal', 'life', 'bigger', 'badder', 'more', 'insane', 'ever', 'watch', 'slowly', 'plan', 'everything', 'slowly', 'apart', 'front', 'conclusion', 'series', 'left', 'weeping', 'did', 'many', 'others', 'third', 'season', 'been', 'promised', 'so', 'can', 'do', 'wait', 'again', 'now', 'have', 'six', 'episodes', 'instead', 'three', 'keep', 'company.This', 'one', 'best', 'series', 'television', 'country', 'excellent', 'acting', 'Benedict', 'Cumberbatch', 'Martin', 'Freeman-the', 'best', 'Holmes', 'Watson', 'duo', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Jeremy', 'Brett', 'two', 'co-stars', 'Rathbone', 'Bruce', 'writing', 'cinematography', 'would', 'be', 'excellent', 'big', 'budget', 'films', 'wonderful', 'blending', 'modern', 'day', 'essentially', 'Holmes', 'must', 'have', 'fans', 'great', 'detective', 'British', 'Mystery', 'series', 'simply', 'great', 'television']",Sherlock: Season 2

1425546,A3EXIUOGZVV132,B004QOB8SO,Stacy,"[3, 8]","Sherlock is an excellent series. The show has a compelling antihero, a likeable sidekick, and an intriguing main villain. The secondary characters are interesting as well, in particular Mrs. Hudson, Molly and Mycroft. Sgt Donovan is wonderfully spiteful and is a character you love to hate. Hopefully there will be more of her in future episodes.Watson seems like a regular guy, but he's much more than that. He's loyal, courageous and a real hero. Sherlock is a man of mystery who has repressed his emotions to enhance his career, though one gets the feeling he's created this persona as a form of self-protection. He has moments of vulnerability that prevent the character from being a one-dimensional know-it-all.The updated stories are clever twists on the originals. Though it's clearly modern, certain images and moments stir feelings of the past. From Holmes and Watson's auspicious first meeting in A Study in Pink to the gut-wrenching end of  The Reichenbach Fall, this series is almost always satisfying. The only fault rests in the first episode of season two.A Scandal in Belgravia is the weakest episode of both seasons and was the deciding factor between a 4 and 5 star rating from this reviewer. The Irene Adler character has never been a favorite of mine, but in this series she sinks to a new low. Sherlock unfortunately relies on the common and disappointing theme that a woman cannot be powerful and cunning without relying on her sexuality. If handled differently, this modern Irene Adler could have been a respectable challenge for a man without equal. Instead their interaction degraded the otherwise remarkable character of Sherlock Holmes. By his infatuation with a glorified prostitute, he turns out to be as ordinary as Moriarty labels him in The Great Game. It will take a great deal of redemption in season three for this particular Holmes to recapture the aura he emanated prior to Irene Adler, but I have high hopes for him and look forward to more in this overall fantastic series.",4,Almost Perfect,1341014400,"06 30, 2012",2012,2012,"['Sherlock', 'excellent', 'series', 'show', 'compelling', 'antihero', 'likeable', 'sidekick', 'intriguing', 'main', 'villain', 'secondary', 'characters', 'are', 'interesting', 'as', 'well', 'particular', 'Mrs.', 'Hudson', 'Molly', 'Mycroft', 'Sgt', 'Donovan', 'wonderfully', 'spiteful', 'character', 'love', 'hate', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'future', 'episodes.Watson', 'regular', 'guy', 'much', 'more', 'loyal', 'courageous', 'real', 'hero', 'Sherlock', 'man', 'mystery', 'who', 'repressed', 'emotions', 'enhance', 'career', 'one', 'feeling', 'created', 'persona', 'form', 'self-protection', 'moments', 'vulnerability', 'prevent', 'character', 'being', 'one-dimensional', 'know-it-all.The', 'updated', 'stories', 'are', 'clever', 'twists', 'originals', 'clearly', 'modern', 'certain', 'images', 'moments', 'stir', 'feelings', 'past', 'Holmes', 'Watson', 'auspicious', 'first', 'meeting', 'A', 'Study', 'Pink', 'gut-wrenching', 'end', 'Reichenbach', 'Fall', 'series', 'almost', 'always', 'satisfying', 'only', 'fault', 'rests', 'first', 'episode', 'season', 'two.A', 'Scandal', 'Belgravia', 'weakest', 'episode', 'seasons', 'was', 'deciding', 'factor', '4', '5', 'star', 'rating', 'reviewer', 'Irene', 'Adler', 'character', 'never', 'been', 'favorite', 'mine', 'series', 'new', 'low', 'Sherlock', 'unfortunately', 'relies', 'common', 'disappointing', 'theme', 'woman', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'powerful', 'cunning', 'relying', 'sexuality', 'handled', 'differently', 'modern', 'Irene', 'Adler', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'respectable', 'challenge', 'man', 'equal', 'Instead', 'interaction', 'degraded', 'otherwise', 'remarkable', 'character', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'infatuation', 'glorified', 'prostitute', 'out', 'be', 'as', 'ordinary', 'Moriarty', 'labels', 'Great', 'Game', 'will', 'take', 'great', 'deal', 'redemption', 'season', 'three', 'particular', 'Holmes', 'recapture', 'aura', 'emanated', 'prior', 'Irene', 'Adler', 'have', 'high', 'hopes', 'look', 'forward', 'more', 'overall', 'fantastic', 'series']",Sherlock: Season 2

1425566,A277UC8WJVAIIE,B004QOB8SO,The Wiz,"[3, 4]","Although I'm not a literary fan of Sherlock Holmes or of past movies and television that the books inspired, I find the BBC series ""Sherlock"" to be entirely captivating.  My impression of the central figure is of a renegade detective, kinda like Batman, that uses his intellect to solve crime in an otherwise apathetic city occasionally troubled by super-villains, all set within a modern context meant to provide at least a level of realism so as to appeal to the largest audience possible.  I think it worked.A Scandal in Belgravia:  At first I was a little put off by the season opener but in retrospect I was struck by the logic of a real-life, female super-criminal potentially being on the pervy side which would represent her primary ""power"" of control in a male-dominated society.  This however gives Holmes something of an edge when dealing with said baddy, who was apparently intended by the writers to be irresistible but only elicits a ""meh"" from her brilliant adversary.  It's actually her wit and incessant texting that causes Holmes to eventually take enough interest to prompt the climactic and completely unexpected conclusion.Although I was hoping that the show might take a more supernatural direction in Hounds of Baskerville (I'm a fantasy lover after all), I thought this episode centered on a very clever plot coupled with the possibility of seemingly, unexplained phenomena unnerving an otherwise unshakeable Holmes, thus introducing an element of vulnerability to this character.  Not gonna spoil, but to refer back to the Batman analogy I'll mention a factor in this story that reminds me very much of one his arch-enemies (i.e. Scarecrow).The Reichenbach Fall:  I thought Moriarty was a rather disappointing arch-enemy not being very charismatic and a little on the femme side.  A sort of brilliant psychopath completely bored with life, he seemed more of the evil genius type and less the criminal mastermind and ultimately his role was (in my opinion) the only real blot on the series.  Otherwise an exceptionally thrilling and dramatic season finale with lots of twists and turnsDoctor Watson is probably Sherlock's first real friend, with a relationship based on complementary personalities. For example, Holmes' apparent contempt for humanity, which he cooly acknowledges as sociopathic, is countered by Watson's compassionate tendencies, probably provoked by his own past sufferings, towards clients or just people in general.  Also, Holmes' single-minded brilliance can be more than a little off-putting to most people and again Watson helps to mitigate the effect and defend his friend on a rather frequent basis.  Regarding their unusual but obviously strong friendship, the recurring homosexual innuendos are a little annoying but I suspect they're there to enhance US appeal.Exceptional television, excellent premise, first-rate actors with filming style more like a movie than a TV series and we're already seeing knock-offs of Holmes' character on a handful of lame, US crime-dramas which I guess is the highest form of flattery.  Again, what would peeps in the US do for smart entertainment if it weren't for the BBC?  :o)",5,Super-Detective,1343260800,"07 26, 2012",2012,3163,"[""'m"", 'not', 'literary', 'fan', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'past', 'movies', 'television', 'books', 'inspired', 'find', 'BBC', 'series', 'Sherlock', 'be', 'entirely', 'captivating', 'impression', 'central', 'figure', 'renegade', 'detective', 'kinda', 'Batman', 'intellect', 'solve', 'crime', 'otherwise', 'apathetic', 'city', 'occasionally', 'troubled', 'super-villains', 'set', 'modern', 'context', 'meant', 'provide', 'least', 'level', 'realism', 'so', 'appeal', 'largest', 'audience', 'possible', 'think', 'Scandal', 'Belgravia', 'first', 'was', 'little', 'put', 'off', 'season', 'opener', 'retrospect', 'was', 'struck', 'logic', 'real-life', 'female', 'super-criminal', 'potentially', 'being', 'pervy', 'side', 'would', 'represent', 'primary', 'power', 'control', 'male-dominated', 'society', 'however', 'Holmes', 'something', 'edge', 'when', 'dealing', 'said', 'baddy', 'who', 'was', 'apparently', 'intended', 'writers', 'be', 'irresistible', 'only', 'meh', 'brilliant', 'adversary', 'actually', 'wit', 'incessant', 'texting', 'Holmes', 'eventually', 'take', 'enough', 'interest', 'prompt', 'climactic', 'completely', 'unexpected', 'conclusion.Although', 'was', 'hoping', 'show', 'might', 'take', 'more', 'supernatural', 'direction', 'Hounds', 'Baskerville', ""'m"", 'fantasy', 'lover', 'thought', 'episode', 'centered', 'very', 'clever', 'plot', 'coupled', 'possibility', 'seemingly', 'unexplained', 'phenomena', 'unnerving', 'otherwise', 'unshakeable', 'Holmes', 'thus', 'introducing', 'element', 'vulnerability', 'character', 'Not', 'gon', 'spoil', 'refer', 'back', 'Batman', 'analogy', ""'ll"", 'mention', 'factor', 'story', 'very', 'much', 'one', 'arch-enemies', 'i.e', 'Scarecrow', '.The', 'Reichenbach', 'Fall', 'thought', 'Moriarty', 'was', 'rather', 'disappointing', 'arch-enemy', 'not', 'being', 'very', 'charismatic', 'little', 'femme', 'side', 'sort', 'brilliant', 'psychopath', 'completely', 'bored', 'life', 'seemed', 'more', 'evil', 'genius', 'type', 'less', 'criminal', 'mastermind', 'ultimately', 'role', 'was', 'opinion', 'only', 'real', 'blot', 'series', 'Otherwise', 'exceptionally', 'thrilling', 'dramatic', 'season', 'finale', 'lots', 'twists', 'turnsDoctor', 'Watson', 'probably', 'Sherlock', 'first', 'real', 'friend', 'relationship', 'based', 'complementary', 'personalities', 'example', 'Holmes', 'apparent', 'contempt', 'humanity', 'acknowledges', 'sociopathic', 'countered', 'Watson', 'compassionate', 'tendencies', 'probably', 'provoked', 'own', 'past', 'sufferings', 'towards', 'clients', 'just', 'people', 'general', 'Also', 'Holmes', 'single-minded', 'brilliance', 'can', 'be', 'more', 'little', 'off-putting', 'most', 'people', 'again', 'Watson', 'mitigate', 'effect', 'defend', 'friend', 'rather', 'frequent', 'basis', 'Regarding', 'unusual', 'obviously', 'strong', 'friendship', 'recurring', 'homosexual', 'innuendos', 'are', 'little', 'annoying', 'suspect', ""'re"", 'enhance', 'US', 'appeal.Exceptional', 'television', 'excellent', 'premise', 'first-rate', 'actors', 'filming', 'style', 'more', 'movie', 'TV', 'series', ""'re"", 'already', 'seeing', 'knock-offs', 'Holmes', 'character', 'handful', 'lame', 'US', 'crime-dramas', 'guess', 'highest', 'form', 'flattery', 'Again', 'what', 'would', 'peeps', 'US', 'do', 'smart', 'entertainment', 'were', ""n't"", 'BBC', 'o']",Sherlock: Season 2

Picking up exactly where Season 1 left off, we quickly spiral towards another mystery. The first episode is probably my favorite in this season because we get a closer look at Sherlock, and witness something we haven't before. A female advisary for Holmes, who may, or may not be smitten with the detective. Naturally, Holmes won't make it THAT easy for the viewer to guess what he's thinking, but by the end of the episode, we catch a glimmer of something... I will leave it at that because it's always more fun to watch it for yourself. Episode 2 features the infamous Hound of Baskerville. It is probably the weakest episode in terms of character development but again, we get to witness something special when Holmes and Watson are on screen together. Episode 3 is a real nail-biter and leaves you emotionally drained and at the edge of your seat.What is there left to say about Benedict Cumberbatch that hasn't already been said?  He is even better this season than he was the last, if you can believe that. The dead-pan humour, intense stare (which even Watson remarks on) is magnified here, without ever seeming over-the-top. He even smiles more here! He is still as arrogant and impatient as ever, finding fault with whomever is in his vision and bringing them down to size. Though he is starting to realize he probably shouldn't be so harsh to absolutely everyone he meets, and we see some of the reprocussions that can happen when his mouth runs away with him.The cinematography is beautiful, the costumes, simple but so nice. I especially love Sherlock's overcoat and blue scarf, which he never seems to forget to wear, even in a dire situation. The supporting cast does a wonderful job as well, and I can't wait to see what season three brings. Sherlock Holmes is not only a superb show, but a wonderful character, who now, has easily become one of my favorite characters ever on screen.

Stephen Moffat who currently writes/produces ""Doctor Who"" for the BBC  does a marvelous job of taking the essence of Arthur Conan Doyle's crime solving maverick and reimsgines him as a brilliant, high level functioning sociopath (as Holmes described himself in the very first episode of the fist season). Moffat has updated these stories remarkably well and made them less than predictable even if you've read the original stories.The show wouldnt be half as impressive without the brilliant casting of Benedict Cumberbatch, Matin Freeman, Lara Pulver, and Andrew ScottThe stories tackled during the second season of the series includes ""A Scandal in Belgravia"", The Hound of the Baskervilles"" (retitled ""The Hound of Baskerville"" here) and ""The Reichenbach Falls"". All three are presented in their original feature length presentations on the BBC.All three stories are reinvented with modern trappings taking the basic plot and stories from Doyle's stories but liberally introducing new elements to update them for the 21st century. That means that some of them are a bit surprising in terms of the twists and turns although you might know the outcome at the end, it will help to revitalize the stories and make them entertaining yet again. The weakest of the three presented here is ""The Hound of Baskerville"" which does, indeed, receive many updated elements that make it still fun and entertaining but, as it is the most adapted of the Doyle stories, it is also the best known. That said, the script by Mark Gatiss is marvelously inventive with some truly stunning set pieces. Gatiss who plays Mycroft Holmes does double duty in many episodes and as an actor he is truly outstanding as well and might easily be overlooked given the other performers in the show. His work isn't quite as showy but it's every bit the equal of his co-stars.The Blu-ray presentation is quite nice with rich colors, often stunning detail althought the contrast Is a bit on the weak side but overall this looks pretty impressive.Audio is crystal clear although you have to pump up the volume a bit if you choose to listen it in stereo. We also get English subtitles.We get commentary tracks for ""Belgravia"" and ""Baskervilles"" from the writers/producers Moffat, co-creator Mark Gatiss, cast members on each one Cumberbatch and Purvis joining them on the former and Purvis along with guest star Russell Tovey.We also get a 20 minute featurettes ""Sherlock Uncovered"" about the production of the second season.""Sherlock"" improves on an already terrific first season as Moffat and Gatiss radically recreate Holmes for the 21st century.Recommended.",5,A bold reinvention of Doyle's creation in a terrific and well performed  series,1339891200,"06 17, 2012",2012,2757,"['Reinventing', 'popular', 'culture', 'heroes', 'always', 'tricky', 'business-you', 'run', 'risk', 'ruining', 'everything', 'made', 'original', 'special', 'Stephen', 'Moffat', 'who', 'currently', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'BBC', 'marvelous', 'job', 'taking', 'essence', 'Arthur', 'Conan', 'Doyle', 'crime', 'solving', 'maverick', 'brilliant', 'high', 'level', 'functioning', 'sociopath', 'Holmes', 'described', 'very', 'first', 'episode', 'fist', 'season', 'Moffat', 'updated', 'stories', 'remarkably', 'well', 'made', 'less', 'predictable', 'even', ""'ve"", 'read', 'original', 'stories.The', 'show', 'wouldnt', 'be', 'half', 'impressive', 'brilliant', 'casting', 'Benedict', 'Cumberbatch', 'Matin', 'Freeman', 'Lara', 'Pulver', 'Andrew', 'ScottThe', 'stories', 'tackled', 'second', 'season', 'series', 'A', 'Scandal', 'Belgravia', 'Hound', 'Baskervilles', 'retitled', 'Hound', 'Baskerville', 'here', 'Reichenbach', 'Falls', 'three', 'are', 'presented', 'original', 'feature', 'length', 'presentations', 'BBC.All', 'three', 'stories', 'are', 'reinvented', 'modern', 'trappings', 'taking', 'basic', 'plot', 'stories', 'Doyle', 'stories', 'liberally', 'introducing', 'new', 'elements', 'update', '21st', 'century', 'are', 'bit', 'surprising', 'terms', 'twists', 'might', 'know', 'outcome', 'end', 'will', 'help', 'revitalize', 'stories', 'make', 'entertaining', 'yet', 'again', 'weakest', 'three', 'presented', 'here', 'Hound', 'Baskerville', 'indeed', 'receive', 'many', 'updated', 'elements', 'make', 'still', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'most', 'adapted', 'Doyle', 'stories', 'also', 'best', 'known', 'said', 'script', 'Mark', 'Gatiss', 'marvelously', 'inventive', 'truly', 'stunning', 'set', 'pieces', 'Gatiss', 'who', 'Mycroft', 'Holmes', 'double', 'duty', 'many', 'episodes', 'actor', 'truly', 'outstanding', 'as', 'well', 'might', 'easily', 'be', 'overlooked', 'given', 'other', 'performers', 'show', 'work', ""n't"", 'quite', 'showy', 'bit', 'equal', 'co-stars.The', 'Blu-ray', 'presentation', 'quite', 'nice', 'rich', 'colors', 'often', 'stunning', 'detail', 'althought', 'contrast', 'bit', 'weak', 'side', 'overall', 'pretty', 'impressive.Audio', 'crystal', 'clear', 'have', 'pump', 'up', 'volume', 'bit', 'choose', 'listen', 'stereo', 'also', 'get', 'English', 'subtitles.We', 'get', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'Belgravia', 'Baskervilles', 'writers/producers', 'Moffat', 'co-creator', 'Mark', 'Gatiss', 'cast', 'members', 'one', 'Cumberbatch', 'Purvis', 'joining', 'former', 'Purvis', 'guest', 'star', 'Russell', 'Tovey.We', 'also', 'get', '20', 'minute', 'Sherlock', 'Uncovered', 'production', 'second', 'season', 'Sherlock', 'already', 'terrific', 'first', 'season', 'Moffat', 'Gatiss', 'radically', 'recreate', 'Holmes', '21st', 'century.Recommended']",Sherlock: Season 2
