I grew up watching the show, and loved it because it was so funny, and it made my folks laugh, too.However, this DVD is simply a lot of promise and no delivery.  Imagine someone tells you about this great wine.  You are shown the bottle, it's poured in the glass, you're allowed to smell its bouquet, and then... it's taken away.  That's just how you'll feel watching this DVD.  First off, the DVD is only 40 minutes long - the original hour special, minus all the commercials.  There are hours of material that could have been put into a proper DVD, so why wasn't it?  The material that is here is very funny, but 10-15 second clips just only go so far with true fans of this very funny show.  The show was so great, with such a great cast - why no one bothered to dig in and add some content to the DVD version of the TV special is way beyond me.Save your money, and send a letter to the companies that hold the rights to the Carol Burnett Show, and ask them to produce a proper DVD special!",1,Burnett Deserves better than this DVD,1072051200,"12 22, 2003",2003,1066,"['Let', 'start', 'first', 'admitting', 'bias', ""'m"", 'HUGE', 'Carol', 'Burnett', 'fan', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'show', 'loved', 'was', 'so', 'funny', 'made', 'folks', 'too.However', 'DVD', 'simply', 'lot', 'promise', 'delivery', 'Imagine', 'someone', 'great', 'wine', 'are', 'shown', 'bottle', 'poured', 'glass', ""'re"", 'allowed', 'smell', 'bouquet', 'then', 'taken', 'away', 'just', 'how', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'watching', 'DVD', 'First', 'DVD', 'only', '40', 'minutes', 'long', 'original', 'hour', 'special', 'commercials', 'are', 'hours', 'material', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'put', 'proper', 'DVD', 'so', 'why', 'was', ""n't"", 'material', 'here', 'very', 'funny', '10-15', 'second', 'clips', 'just', 'only', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'true', 'fans', 'very', 'funny', 'show', 'show', 'was', 'so', 'great', 'great', 'cast', 'why', 'one', 'bothered', 'dig', 'add', 'content', 'DVD', 'version', 'TV', 'special', 'way', 'me.Save', 'money', 'send', 'letter', 'companies', 'hold', 'rights', 'Carol', 'Burnett', 'Show', 'ask', 'produce', 'proper', 'DVD', 'special']",The Carol Burnett Show - Show Stoppers

I've just sat here mesmerized for the last 45 minutes, watching clips of shows I hadn't thought of in years, and seeing a couple ones I don't remember that were hilarious!I love this idea of a reunion show and showstopper clips!  I loved seeing Bob Mackie and the tribute to him; I hadn't known he designed all the costumes on there; I thought he just did the haute couture clothes.  Was also really nice to ''meet'' him, as I had never seen him before.I adored the camaraderie they all shared, and loved sharing this with them.  Loved the clips, especially Mama telling Eunice that someone had blown her pilot light out!  Was great seeing Charo and her ''Mama;'' that has always been one of my favorites.I do not get all the complaints.  This was a reunion show.  The DVD was made from the show.  I think they did a magnificent job getting so many clips on there in such a short amount of time, while still having time to have fun with each other and the audience.This was NOT just a DVD made to have every funny skit that was ever on there in DVD form.

There are too many questions from the audiences, but if you like banter, you will probably give this a five. The clips are short, however, when do you see long outtakes? They need to set it up and then play the clips. It's a long show about outtakes. So, with all of that said, I love it. The Elephant sketch is my favorite, and second is probably Carol flashing Tim and busting him up, and then turning around to show the audience....hysterical. A few things, the actual transfer is not as good as it could be. I wish they would have done a better job there. Also, there is no need to bleep the bad words on a dvd....I would have loved to hear the uncensored version. For these two reasons I took off a full star. I just think all the audience time makes it feel longer. okay....watching it again, I have downgraded it to 2 stars because of the musical numbers....COMPLETELY unnecessary and time consuming, and because it was just too short! This could have easily been a 5 star DVD, with a little effort. WARNING: there is a Bob Mackie tribute at the end....Why? I really don't know. It makes no sense, unless Bob Mackie was behind this DVD and was trying to promote himself. The ending was a complete waste! 2 more stars off for this.
