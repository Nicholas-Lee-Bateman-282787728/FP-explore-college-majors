As a cyberpunk sci-fi film, ""Gamer"" has some interesting ideas.But as a movie, ""Gamer"" is quite the mess.  The plot jumps around through several different viewpoints, and there are some parts that either don't make sense, or are left hanging or unexplained, or must be figured out through context.  It all comes together as it goes on, but at times I felt lost.  And the movie's resolution seemed weak as well.  The camera is extremely shaky and goes all over the place, with lots of fast cuts.  Characters are pretty average; acting is okay (though I found the bad guy a little too cheesy), and the writing seems a bit nutty at times.  On the plus side, production design is decent, with good sets, props, costumes, and special effects.  Action scenes are pretty decent (even if the camera goes all over the place).  And the music is pretty interesting (though the use of Marylin Manson's ""Sweet Dreams"" reminded me too much of ""House on Haunted Hill"").Overall, the movie is pretty bad and I wouldn't recommend it to many people.  But I did enjoy it, and I think it goes good with ""The Running Man,"" ""Death Race,"" and ""Rollerball.""The disc is of good quality.  Video and sound are darn near perfect; the picture looks very sharp, clean, clear, and highly detailed.  Film grain is hardly noticeable at all, but with no signs of DNR or any other alterations.  Sound quality is clear and bombastic.

1286755,A32Y55Z00QI12S,B002SG7Z7A,ARK,"[7, 12]","This movie is foul, boring, and reprehensible. Look, I knew I wasn't going into Casablanca here. I hoped to find something with cheap action thrills, something brainless and entertaining. In short, I wanted some kind of action movie with the kind of excitement that, say, Die Hard might deliver. Instead, I got an eyeful of movie turd.Firstly, it never truly delivers on the cool idea of convicts being ""controlled"" by ""players"" in a ""live shooter"" -- and of one of those convicts breaking free of the control to wreak havoc. Instead, it half-bakes everything: relationship between player and Kable, the battle results, the convict that's supposed to kick Kable's butt, the Humanz, the final showdown. It would bring up several interesting ideas and then drop them or only half-finish them. It's like it had no idea how to weave them together in a solid fashion.Secondly, since the plotline is lame, the firefights suffer as a result. The fighting is just meaningless sound and special effects -- loud, flashy, and empty. The cinematography is jerky, irritating, and headache-inducing. Several times I had to blink and sit back a bit, wondering what I was supposed to be seeing. (For example, take Kable's tattoo in the very beginning, which I couldn't read in the very first shot -- even though that shot was a close-up on a massive screen the size of a couple of elephants.) I'm sure that if there was a coherent story, all of this odd editing would have meant something.Unfortunately, if you're looking for satisfying thrills, this is not it. You cannot have satisfying thrills if there is no one and nothing to root for. Indeed, none of the characters have anything to commend them. I hated everyone but Kable -- and for Kable, I only had a lukewarm respect. This respect completely disappeared when Kable snapped the back of a man who was not in control of himself -- a state of mind that Kable should have completely understood. That just made me ill, and after that point, I didn't care what happened to Kable at all.Thirdly, it's just plain nasty. Look, I can handle disturbing subjects and violence; I love Bioshock and District 9, for example. But this movie has a horrible ""spirit"" about it, for lack of a better word. You are going to leave it feeling like you just crawled out of a dumpster.When I say ""nasty,"" I'm not talking about the violence. The gore was so over the top that you couldn't take it seriously. No, what makes it truly disturbing is the gratuitous and boring sexually-charged scenes. Sometimes it's only two steps away from pornography. This disgust is mostly due to the fact that most of it involved ""real"" and ""innocent"" people being abused by third parties, which is just beyond creepy... a feeling that was only exacerbated by the fights that ended up taking out innocent people who were ALL in the same situation as Kable's wife.See, a cool gunfight should make you say, ""All right! Nail that bad guy!"" Not, ""Oh my gosh! How horrible!"" I couldn't help but think, there's some poor sap who just came to do their job today, just like Mrs. Tillman. They probably have kids (just like Mrs. Tillman) and their hobby is probably something cute like flower arranging and scrapbooking and they volunteer at Habitat for Humanity on the weekends and BAM shot in the head there it all goes. Okay, so how is whacking innocent people supposed to be thrilling? Tell me. Please.Another thing that really annoyed me was that there are more bizarre boob shots in this than can be counted. How anyone could render the harmless breast foul and hideous is an achievement in itself (not necessarily a good one). The shock value quickly gives way to nauseated cries of, ""Urgh! Not again! Stop that! Stop!"" I was tired of it within the first fifteen minutes, especially when two high school girls bared their bony fishbelly-white chests at the screen. Naked corpses! How appetizing!Finally, it's unforgivably nonsensical and stupid. Even if it's an action movie, its premise has to be plausible to some degree for it to work, okay? But when your whole ""mental control"" shtick is so retarded that a ten-year-old would laugh at you, and Gerard Butler's big escape includes the humping of a truck, and when a villain comes trotting out doing a song-and-dance number, you start doubting your sanity. In fact, if I did drugs, I'm pretty sure I would hallucinate this movie.I think that part of the problem is that the producers of this stupid film became confused and decided that they were actually making a movie with deep themes about the natures of control and entertainment. They should have figured out if they were making an entertaining movie or not, though, because the result is that the movie has no identity. It is so set on shocking you that it fails to entertain; and as entertainment is what I went to this movie for, it ended up failing miserably.If you want a shoot-em-up, Gamer will deliver -- but with little to no emotional oomph, and only providing relief that you never have to watch the thing again.",1,Warning: Movie Contains Wholesale Suckage,1252108800,"09 5, 2009",2009,5030,"['movie', 'foul',

1286756,A1DG75OT3Y49EM,B002SG7Z7A,"ashertopia ""@gmail .com""","[3, 5]","Gamer is a movie about a convicted death row felon, who is mind-linked to a rich geek video game player through a video game called Slayer, who is trying to get out of prison by completing, i.e. ""living through,"" a certain amount of death match levels. The characters in the ""game"" are all convicted felons on death row. Our hero, Kable in-game, John Tillman in the real world, was (of course) sent to jail for a crime he didn't intend to commit. This leaves his wife, Angie, only one option to make a living: become a whore in an online live-action porn video game, Society. Subsequently, his daughter has been taken away to a foster home; with a father murderer and a mother whore why wouldn't he be? Kable must free himself, save his wife, find his daughter and put a stop to the terrible game.I think this movie was called, ""The Running Man,"" last time it was a movie.There is nothing new here except for an amazingly vulgar ride through the filth of the director's mind and vision. Will there be games like Society or Slayers in the future? Probably, but maybe without real people avatars - instead it would simply be players in 3D chambers with sense feedback. Is that a social commentary worth considering? Yes, but this movie doesn't take that seriously at all. In fact, everything unravels into a simple vendetta film. And not even a well made simple vendetta film. The viewer is subjected to a ridiculous amount of camera tear-a-ways, static and screen debris that serves to confuse the action and distract instead of make the film more edgy or techie.The content of the story is ripe for social commentary and questions of morality but this movie skims the surface of those depths and is in its own way a commentary on how society doesn't take social issues seriously.

And it just drives the point home how we are so obsessed with violence in America that we make idols of our Mansons, our Dahmers and our George W. Bushes.

1286761,A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,B002SG7Z7A,Caleb Williams,"[2, 2]","There seems to be developing a trend in recent years with these films being critical of society and the way it looks to be going. Films such asLive!,Surrogatesand now this all seem to enjoy saying the same thing; ""This is an image of you society and we don't like it"". Ken Clarke's one of the originators of this type of film with his collection of films featuring teenagers getting down and dirty under the sheets. Clarke's films were quite deep, clever and had a serious message to send. ""Gamer"" - on the other hand - said ""we don't like this blood thirsty society, phwoar look at that man's head explode, that was so testosterone pumpingly awesome; now here's a pair of breasts for you to enjoy"". I usually like these types of films, as they usually have something quite serious to say, whilst at the same time still managing to be entertaining. ""Gamer"" was just confusing from this stand-point because, on the one hand it tries to be critical of a blood thirsty society, whilst at the same time being a film that caters to exactly that type of audience.In the year of the future a maniac by the name of Ken Castle (Michael C. Hall) has invented self replicating nanites which allow people to remotely control the movements of others. This technology led to the creation of the game ""Society"" where fat, spotty, disgusting teenagers would pay to control other people who are paid to be controlled and have them have sex with each other or just be downright depraved without leaving the comfort of your own sofa. It's also led to the creation of convict slaying computer game ""Slayer"" which allows gamers to control death row convicts in a call of duty deathmatch type game where, if the controlled player, in this instance ""Kable"" (Gerrard ""KING LEONIDAS"" Butler), wins 30 rounds they are set free. He just has to rely on the skills of his controller and a computer hacking pro-humanity group aptly called, ""Humanz"" to get good old ""Kable"" free to get his revenge on that madman Castle.It's got enough blood spattered walls and breasts to please any 13 year old, or every adult with the IQ of a goldfish. Let's look at ""Gamer"" in the context of a relationship. ""Gamer"" is the dominant one while its audience are the naive loved up puppy just wanting to see someone be blown apart by a grenade. Now and again ""Gamer"" will give its audience the love and affection it deserves by showing enough nudity and gore to give any red-blooded male a semi; but then ""Gamer"" has the dark, hidden personality that rears its ugly head in the odd scene and starts abusing its audience. ""Look, see this fat greasy scumbag teenager. This is you. I hate you. You're disgusting"" but will then realise the harshness of what it's just done, apologise to its loved up audience and promises never to hurt it again, and proceeds with the blood and nudity.If you look past the self loathing, violent relationship between the film and its viewers, you will be mildly entertained by the mindless action and the - sort of - twist. Michael C. Hall makes me want to watch this film as he's just truly magnificent for every moment he's on screen. You're never sure whether he's, just all of a sudden, going to go slightly mental and start dancing around a sombrero singing la cucaracha while punching a small animal just for the hell of it, as he comes across as that unbalanced. King Leonidas does what he does best which is violently mutilating people while looking intensely into the camera making to worried about whether he's going to punch you just for watching the film. The supporting cast members are forgettable to say the least, as they're merely there to try and give the films plot more purpose and meaning, but just winds up becoming too clich&eacute; to bare.If you do decide to watch this at some point, then you should probably drink a lot before hand.",2,Gamer - Wouldn't it be brilliant if all the soldiers I killed in Call of Duty 4 were real?,1282435200,"08 22, 2010",2010,3840,"['be', 'developing', 'trend', 'recent', 'years', 'films', 'being', 'critical', 'society', 'way', 'be', 'going', 'Films', 'such', 'asLive', 'Surrogatesand', 'now', 'seem', 'enjoy', 'saying', 'same', 'thing', 'image', 'society', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Ken', 'Clarke', 'one', 'originators', 'type', 'film', 'collection', 'films', 'featuring', 'teenagers', 'getting', 'down', 'dirty', 'sheets', 'Clarke', 'films', 'were', 'quite', 'deep', 'clever', 'had', 'serious', 'message', 'send', 'Gamer', 'other', 'hand', 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'blood', 'thirsty', 'society', 'phwoar', 'look', 'man', 'head', 'explode', 'was', 'so', 'testosterone', 'pumpingly', 'awesome', 'now', 'here', 'pair', 'breasts', 'enjoy', 'usually', 'types', 'films', 'usually', 'have', 'something', 'quite', 'serious', 'say', 'whilst', 'same', 'time', 'still', 'managing', 'be', 'entertaining', 'Gamer', 'was', 'just', 'confusing', 'stand-point', 'one', 'hand', 'be', 'critical', 'blood', 'thirsty', 'society', 'whilst', 'same', 'time', 'being', 'film', 'exactly', 'type', 'audience.In', 'year', 'future', 'maniac', 'name', 'Ken', 'Castle', 'Michael', 'C.', 'Hall', 'invented', 'replicating', 'nanites', 'allow', 'people', 'remotely', 'control', 'movements', 'others', 'technology', 'led', 'creation', 'game', 'Society', 'where', 'fat', 'spotty', 'disgusting', 'teenagers', 'would', 'pay', 'control', 'other', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'paid', 'be', 'controlled', 'have', 'have', 'sex', 'other', 'just', 'be', 'downright', 'depraved', 'leaving', 'comfort', 'own', 'sofa', 'also', 'led', 'creation', 'convict', 'slaying', 'computer', 'game', 'Slayer', 'gamers', 'control', 'death', 'row', 'convicts', 'call', 'duty', 'deathmatch', 'type', 'game', 'where', 'controlled', 'player', 'instance', 'Kable', 'Gerrard', 'KING', 'LEONIDAS', 'Butler', '30', 'rounds', 'are', 'set', 'free', 'just', 'rely', 'skills', 'controller', 'computer', 'hacking', 'pro-humanity', 'group', 'aptly', 'called', 'Humanz', 'get', 'good', 'old', 'Kable', 'free', 'get', 'revenge', 'madman', 'Castle.It', 'got', 'enough', 'blood', 'spattered', 'walls', 'breasts', 'please', '13', 'year', 'old', 'adult', 'IQ', 'goldfish', 'Let', 'look', 'Gamer', 'context', 'relationship', 'Gamer', 'dominant', 'one', 'audience', 'are', 'naive', 'loved', 'up', 'puppy', 'just', 'wanting', 'see', 'someone', 'be', 'blown', 'apart', 'grenade', 'Now', 'again', 'Gamer', 'will', 'give', 'audience', 'love', 'affection', 'showing', 'enough', 'nudity', 'gore', 'give', 'red-blooded', 'male', 'semi', 'then', 'Gamer', 'dark', 'hidden', 'personality', 'ugly', 'head', 'odd', 'scene', 'abusing', 'audience', 'Look', 'see', 'fat', 'greasy', 'scumbag', 'teenager', 'hate', ""'re"", 'disgusting', 'will', 'then', 'realise', 'harshness', 'what', 'just', 'done', 'apologise', 'loved', 'up', 'audience', 'never', 'hurt', 'again', 'proceeds', 'blood', 'nudity.If', 'look', 'self', 'loathing', 'violent', 'relationship', 'film', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'mildly', 'entertained', 'mindless', 'action', 'sort', 'twist', 'Michael', 'C.', 'Hall', 'want', 'watch', 'film', 'just', 'truly', 'magnificent', 'moment', 'screen', ""'re"", 'never', 'sure', 'just', 'sudden', 'going', 'go', 'slightly', 'mental', 'start', 'dancing', 'sombrero', 'singing', 'la', 'cucaracha', 'punching', 'small', 'animal', 'just', 'hell', 'unbalanced', 'King', 'Leonidas', 'what', 'best', 'violently', 'mutilating', 'people', 'looking', 'intensely', 'camera', 'making', 'worried', 'going', 'punch', 'just', 'watching', 'film', 'supporting', 'cast', 'members', 'are', 'forgettable', 'say', 'least', ""'re"", 'merely', 'there', 'try', 'give', 'films', 'plot', 'more', 'purpose', 'meaning', 'just', 'up', 'becoming', 'too', 'clich', 'eacute', 'bare.If', 'do', 'decide', 'watch', 'point', 'then', 'should', 'probably', 'drink', 'lot', 'hand']",N/A

I was literally screaming inside my head wanting to get out, but oh no, it was useless. Instead I had put up with one of the worse movies I have seen recently in the cinema.The movie is set in the future and how video games will be developed. That is not a bad idea considering that video games are ruling the world for some quite time now, but how the director developed the movie was simply ridiculous. Real life inmates are the characters you are playing and it is up to you for that convicted criminal to get out of each battle scenario alive. Yes, this film does contain action sequences but nothing that you haven't seen before.  Gerald Butler is not a bad actor, but this could have easily killed his Hollywood career.  Michael C. Hall gave in my opinion one of the shoddiest performances in 2009. At one point during the film you will not believe your eyes when you see convicts (Yes, that's right... convicts!) dancing to a Frank Sinatra tune. At that state I didn't know the perspective of the director and his intentions if it were to make us laugh or try to be psychedelic one way or the other. To me, it was just another reason to affirm how bad this movie is.Reading the few 5 star reviews of this film makes me wonder if we saw the same movie, but in the end for some reason they are the minorities (No offense). Once I left the theater I ran to the nearest pub and drowned myself in liquor thinking how I was never going to get those 2 hours of my life back.

1286768,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B002SG7Z7A,Chris Pandolfi,"[5, 11]","""Gamer"" is a painfully bad film founded on a painfully bad premise that doesn't seem in any way, shape, or form complete. Don't make the mistake of believing it's a commentary on the media and violence in society; if the filmmakers were truly concerned with sending an actual message, they wouldn't have borrowed so freely from far better developed films like ""The Matrix,"" ""Rollerball,"" ""The Running Man,"" or even the terrible ""Death Race."" No, this movie lives up to its name by behaving like a meaningless, mindless video game, brutally assaulting the senses with lots of action, lots of violence, and lots of grimy, surreal imagery that can't be explained. Is there a plot? Yes, but it was either edited out of all comprehension or not entirely thought through during the writing process. In other words, the finished film is completely dead from the neck up.Describing the plot will require a lot of conjecture on my part, but that's to be expected when you're left with more questions than answers. In the not too distant future, a mind-controlling technology too preposterous to explain enables video games to be played like never before, giving gamers the ability to control real people instead of computer-generated images. The most popular of these games is an online death match called ""Slayers,"" in which actual death row inmates are forced to fight for survival on bombed out city streets. Each inmate believes that they will win their freedom if they survive thirty matches. The most popular of these online inmates is John Tillman, nicknamed Kable (Gerard Butler), who's being controlled by Simon Silverton (Logan Lerman), a seventeen-year-old boy who must come from an extremely rich family, given the impressive computer technology he's surrounded by every minute of every day.Would it surprise you to learn that Kable is wrongly imprisoned and motivated by finding his wife and daughter? While sitting in his cell one night, a mysterious woman slips a picture of them through the slot, and warns him that the game's mastermind plans to have him killed. Here enters Ken Castle (Michael C. Hall), an eccentric billionaire whose Southern accent is second only to an arrogance the likes of which I've rarely seen. Only a character this self-absorbed would have the conceit to break into a song-and-dance number just before the film's final showdown. Only directors like Neveldine/Taylor, whose own ""Crank: High Voltage"" was audacious fun, would have the conceit to believe that a song-and-dance number would actually work in this kind of film.Anyway, we eventually learn that Kable's wife, Angie (Amber Valletta), is trapped in another online game called ""Society,"" where sins of the flesh are the main attraction. With the help of Humanz, a renegade hacker group led by Humanz Brother (Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges), Kable is able to sever his connection with Simon and go rescue his wife. This, naturally, raises questions as to how it's possible for game characters to wander from one game to another and where these separate games are located and why players don't seem to live anywhere near these locations, but never mind--the last thing this movie bothers with is trying to explain itself. I can only assume the game locations are situated in some quarantined area of the country and that some futuristic technology is required to keep these areas secret.There comes a point when Castle reveals something about himself, which then raises even more questions about the nature of his mind-control technology and exactly who's playing who. To reveal more would be pointless and subtracting, and so would describing any more of this plot. Do you know what it's like watching a video game when someone else is playing? You have no control over what you're seeing or what happens. Now imagine watching someone else play a video game after three or four levels have already been completed; not only is the game not in your control, but you also have no idea what's going on and what the objective is. This is exactly what watching ""Gamer"" is like. You see all this action and visual spectacle but are unable to make sense of anything.The only actor who seemed to understand what he was dealing with was Michael C. Hall, whose performance is so bad it's as if he knew the film couldn't be taken seriously. The man hams it up so thoroughly that I came to the conclusion it was intentional on his part. The same can't be said for Gerard Butler, Luracris, Kyra Sedgwick, Amber Valletta, Alison Lohman, or even John Leguizamo as a creepy inmate who, like a storyteller, observes everything around him. They must not have known what to make of this film. I know exactly where they're coming from. Given the nature of the story, I can only assume that an actual video game will be made out of ""Gamer."" If that happens, let us hope, for the sake of the players, it will include a fully realized plot that can be followed.",1,Hate the Game and the Player,1252195200,"09 6, 2009",2009,4923,"['Gamer',

The Movie gets 5 Stars (and have owned the original Blu-Ray since it's release)...I bought the 3D Version when it was released, finally got around to (trying to) watch it yesterday; but the freaking disc will not play... It just perpetually ""loads"" until the PS3 gives up, 5 minutes later (evidenced via the circulating 'disc icon' in the top right corner of the PS3 main screen, telling you it's ""reading"" the disc.)This is just the most recent in a long string of Lionsgate releases to screw customers... so it's not all that surprising.... What is surprising, is I can't find any articles/reviews about it, anywhere... so now I'm wondering if I'm just the (un)lucky one here?-- (other Lionsgate releases which have plagued customers... all of which have the same issue outlined above):""Saw 3D"", which would not play in the older/bigger PS3 systems, only the newer ""slim"" ones...""Stargate (15th Anniversary Edition)"", which would only load/play on a good day on the older/bigger PS3's...And on, and on, and on.Lionsgate has really, really, worked my last freakin' nerve with this crap... 'cause now they're putting out discs that won't even play on the newer/slim PS3's.I tried disabling the internet connection, thinking it might be like Iron Man (1 or 2, the only Non-Lionsgate problem I've ever encountered, which ""they"" quickly solved by having Sony issue a system update); but that had no effect... and checked for available updates as well; but it's current...So... WTF!????  Clearly, many others are able to view this release!???Anyone else having (or especially, had, and somehow resolved) this issue, please leave a comment.ThanksPS: It was purchased (pre-ordered) NEW/SEALED, the disc is flawless, etc.  (no scratches, scuffs, etc.)__________________UPDATE:So, after several attempts (and on 2 different PS3 models), it still would not play...There is still no mention (other than this) anywhere on the web, so hopefully I just got a defective disc (encoded improperly, or just plain blank)... Returned & am awaiting replacement... Will update again once replacement arrives.__________________UPDATE 2:My replacement had no issues -- Loaded/Played immediately.  Either the original disc was encoded incorrectly; or perhaps it was merely blank.I pre-ordered the movie 3-4 weeks prior to its release & my order was likely one of the first to be filled...

1286770,AGR4LKC72JEQ8,B002SG7Z7A,coopertex,"[5, 7]","In the near future, a major conglomorate invents a game of death called, ""Slayer"". In Slayer real life death row convicts are mind controlled and linked to a video game player to the death. All the convicts are transported to battle arenas, which are located in remote places and look like war-torn cities. When they are released in the arenas, they only have two objectives survive and kill opposing players. The convict that survives for 30 games gets a full pardon and released from prison (or from the Slayer game).The best player is a kid and he controls the convict named ""Kable""; and the movie is set at a point where Kable only has to win a few more games to win his freedom. The whole movie looks like a poorly made war movie with sci-fi elements stringed together by a lousy plot and even lousier camera work. The first half of the movie has all of the action with convicts shooting it out with military hardware; lots of guns, assualt rifles and explosives and even airstrikes.The characters themeselves are played by famouse people. Kable (the protagonist)is played by Gerard Butler, The villain is played by Micheal C. Hall. and there is an underground cult led by Ludicras, that wants to end the ""Slayer"" game because they say everything is a lie. I cannot tell you what the lie is or it might spoil the only thing the movies plot has going for it.The only positive things I can mention about this movie is that the special effects are great and well known characters are in it. The special effect comes in conventional stunts, fights and explosions, luckily it is not heavy with the CGI. So the technical aspect of the film is well done.The biggest problems is that the movie feels like it was written by 5 year olds with attention deficit disorder, where there a lots fast cuts, jumping from one scene to the next, short awkward dialong, between characters, cheesy acting and shallow exposition. Most of the time the camera has the jitters and shakes so badly that it detracts from the action sequences and sometimes makes it difficult to see. It really tries to go for that Saving Private Ryan or Blair Witch feel (both great movies), but in Gamer it feels hammy and shallow. Instead of giving me feelings of excitement and tension with the strange movie camera angles, I felt as if I was watching a 90 minute long television commercial.On a sidenote; I should mention that I am a true video game player and can tell you for a fact that most video games nowadays have good camera systems and excellent story telling. Both of which are completely lacking in this movie. I'm glad that I just rented this movie and not purchased it because then I would really feel like a sore loser.If Gamer really tried to be like a video game and was being sold in stores as such, it would be tossed into the bargain bin along with other shovelware, because that is where it belongs for being such a pile of DREK!",1,Shovelware Movie,1267574400,"03 3, 2010",2010,2913,"['near', 'future', 'major', 'conglomorate', 'invents', 'game', 'death', 'called', 'Slayer', 'Slayer', 'real', 'life', 'death', 'row', 'convicts', 'are', 'mind', 'controlled', 'linked', 'video', 'game', 'player', 'death', 'convicts', 'are', 'transported', 'battle', 'arenas', 'are', 'located', 'remote', 'places', 'look', 'war-torn', 'cities', 'When', 'are', 'released', 'arenas', 'only', 'have', 'two', 'objectives', 'survive', 'kill', 'opposing', 'players', 'convict', '30', 'games', 'full', 'pardon', 'released', 'prison', 'Slayer', 'game', '.The', 'best', 'player', 'kid', 'convict', 'named', 'Kable', 'movie', 'set', 'point', 'where', 'Kable', 'only', 'win', 'few', 'more', 'games', 'win', 'freedom', 'whole', 'movie', 'poorly', 'made', 'war', 'movie', 'sci-fi', 'elements', 'stringed', 'together', 'lousy', 'plot', 'even', 'lousier', 'camera', 'work', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'action', 'convicts', 'shooting', 'out', 'military', 'hardware', 'lots', 'guns', 'assualt', 'rifles', 'explosives', 'even', 'airstrikes.The', 'characters', 'themeselves', 'are', 'played', 'famouse', 'people', 'Kable', 'protagonist', 'played', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'villain', 'played', 'Micheal', 'C.', 'Hall', 'underground', 'cult', 'led', 'Ludicras', 'end', 'Slayer', 'game', 'say', 'everything', 'lie', 'can', 'not', 'tell', 'what', 'lie', 'might', 'spoil', 'only', 'thing', 'movies', 'plot', 'going', 'it.The', 'only', 'positive', 'things', 'can', 'mention', 'movie', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'great', 'well', 'known', 'characters', 'are', 'special', 'effect', 'conventional', 'stunts', 'fights', 'explosions', 'luckily', 'not', 'heavy', 'CGI', 'technical', 'aspect', 'film', 'well', 'done.The', 'biggest', 'problems', 'movie', 'feels', 'was', 'written', '5', 'year', 'olds', 'attention', 'deficit', 'disorder', 'where', 'lots', 'fast', 'cuts', 'jumping', 'one', 'scene', 'next', 'short', 'awkward', 'dialong', 'characters', 'cheesy', 'acting', 'shallow', 'exposition', 'Most', 'time', 'camera', 'jitters', 'shakes', 'so', 'badly', 'action', 'sequences', 'sometimes', 'difficult', 'see', 'really', 'go', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'feel', 'great', 'movies', 'Gamer', 'hammy', 'shallow', 'Instead', 'giving', 'feelings', 'excitement', 'tension', 'strange', 'movie', 'camera', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', '90', 'minute', 'long', 'television', 'commercial.On', 'sidenote', 'should', 'mention', 'am', 'true', 'video', 'game', 'player', 'can', 'tell', 'fact', 'most', 'video', 'games', 'nowadays', 'have', 'good', 'camera', 'systems', 'excellent', 'story', 'telling', 'are', 'completely', 'lacking', 'movie', ""'m"", 'glad', 'just', 'rented', 'movie', 'not', 'purchased', 'then', 'would', 'really', 'feel', 'sore', 'loser.If', 'Gamer', 'really', 'tried', 'be', 'video', 'game', 'was', 'being', 'sold', 'stores', 'such', 'would', 'be', 'tossed', 'bargain', 'bin', 'other', 'shovelware', 'where', 'being', 'such', 'pile', 'DREK']",N/A

The plot was actually really good, it was just confusing to me when things kept switching back and forth. The other reviewers made it like the static made it unbearable to watch, that is being a little over dramatic. I believe the static effect was approatitely timed, it made the viewer see what a fake society the world has become in the movie. Everything looked so amazing when someone was playing a game and then when you saw the real world, it was complete and utter chaos.So now for the quick detailed verison of what the movie was about. Gerad Butler plays Kable, who is a criminal who was falsly convicted of a murder. He and other people play in the video game called slayer, so they can be set free if they play the game for 30 days. Here is the catch, in this society they are being controlled by other people due to chips that were placed inside their brain. Kable it desperate to get out of the game because he was taken away from his wife and daughter. Ken Castle(Michael) is the crazy billionare who created the games called society and slayer basically so he could have control over everyone, for he believe everyone is weak minded. I believe this movie demonstrates the theory that people can be controlled by a bigger authoroity, much like Hilter did with Germany. I may be looking too much into it, but I believe this movie was very entertaining and also had a message  behind it. I believe it is a movie you have to watch more than once and you should never watch a movie knowing you will hate it, because chances are you will.

This film is a super hyped visual/satirical film about a futuristic world where people are controlled by others to play their fantasies. At times I was reminded of ""Natural Born Killers"" with its juxtaposition of a variety of visual elements. We are given the grim, bleakly coloured violent world of Slayer, where Kable (Gerard Butler), and other convicts, play deadly war games for their freedom, and then there is the eye candy sexual world of Society, where Kable's wife, Angie (Amber Valletta), is a controlled avatar. Michael C. Hall (from Dexter) plays Ken Castle who is the creator of Society and Slayers.The film's visual clarity and sound is amazing as it was shot in 4K with a digital Red One camera.

1286785,AKNXN7WYK02A2,B002SG7Z7A,Frags McFraggle,"[36, 42]","I could give a synopsis of the film but there are plenty so far. So I'll fill in where the other reviews seem to lack.Gamer is filmed in basically 3 different settings: SLAYERS game world (think call of duty style first person shooter, very dark), SOCIETY game world (The Sims/Second Life type world, very colorful), and reality (which is nowhere near as dark or bright as the gamer world, no suprise).In my own opinion, I think this was a gamer's game. Why? Because, first and formost, this is like the future wave of gaming, true 3 dimensional gaming (don't believe me, go look at Project Natal by Microsoft or the type of gaming Xbox envisions in the future-- THE ISLAND quite blatantly shows xbox's projections)Yes, you had the ""gratuitous violence"" of SLAYERS that you would expect if it was real humans participating in the game, because that's what it is. You have the perversity in SOCIETY that is rampant in SIMS and SECOND LIFE if they could get away with it (come on, who doesn't try to get the Sims to make WooHoo at least once, be honest!) and the creepy 500lb guy pretending to be a hot young chick that EVERYONE hears about on the online world.You have a genius human being who is a little power mad and more than just a little crazy and self absorbed. Which isn't bad until you try taking over the world. You have a hard yet loving hero who was wrongly accused. A wife from who everything was ripped away from her and lives a life of destitution and prostitution. There's even a small group of people who rebel and fight the system, trying to overthrow ""the man"". And there's the gamers, from the kid controlling the hero to the really creepy fat guy who play games for different reasons: fun, control, getting their kicks. But all are desensitized to the games and the fact that these are real actual people they controlling and forcing to do what they (the gamers) wish while (the gamers) themselves are safe and comfortable at home. And yes, there were some cliche moments and the side stories weren't ever really gone into exhaustive detail about. Much like cut-scenes in a video game actually. It was furthering one story line, one hero, one main plotline, to defeat one mega-boss at the very end. Try not to kill too many civilians on the way there.It was horrifying at points. I'm not going to lie, I was seriously disturbed by SOCIETY. But isn't that what humans do? I'm not saying everyone or even a majority, but some people in society are obsessed with situations of a sexual nature and it's represented in video games (often rated M for Mature, but some slide under the radar or be easily perverted) and in real life as well (the booming porn industry). And the violence in society was that much more horrifying because the actors couldn't even protect themselves from it and the gamers controlling them didn't even bother protecting them. SLAYERS? It was pretty gory and gruesome, but the horrifying part there wasn't the slayers themselves, it was all the non-fighters who only had to survive one game for freedom. They didn't have a player to control them, couldn't defend themselves or break away from their programming. None of them ever survived or made it.This was filmed in with RED ONE cameras, which are just freakishly amazing in the fine details (digital stills instead of 35mm, ). So visually, content aside, the shots were so detailed and amazing. One reviewer did mention about the tatoo on his arm at the beginning of the film which you couldn't read until nearer the end, but it seemed more of an intentional focus issue, as when they defocused on John Leguizamo's face severely in the jail, because he was a dead man. When the tatoo was next really shown on, it was focused on severely so that you could see and appreciate the message later on. Yes, the fact that the makers of CRANK is evidenced clearly in some scenes, so if you suffer from seizures or epilesy or anything like that, do not suggest.And the dance scene was perfect for the character who did it by the way! Because all of it truly WAS a game to him. He didn't care about anything but seeing things happen that he wanted to see happen. (sorry, had to mention it)If you refuse to play violent video games, avoid morally disturbing images, or wondering if this is something you want your 15 year old to see, don't. Just NO, don't watch it, don't rent it, have nothing to do with it because you will end up back at this review page leaving a bad review and you are not the intended audience (no offense).I don't like morally disturbing images (I was kinda doing the horrified peeking-through-fingers before ducking behind my hoodie at some parts), don't really play uber violent games (I like multiplayer First Person Shooters but don't really play the campaigns or the GTA series), and I haven't been 18 for quite some time.Who was it that said you could judge a society by the games we play? Isn't it true, at least to some degree? Or by the internet sites we visit, the people we interact with in life, and what we choose to do with the knowledge we have? Does that not have any bearing on that judgement?I think it was an excellent movie. Not because I agreed with everything that happened in it or thought the characters/acting was superb (though the actors did a very good job in this video game of a movie). But this movie actually makes one, especially the intelligent gamers out there, think for a moment about how far we are willing to go for our entertainment.

On one level I would like to see society get rid of their human garbage without having to take care of them for 50 years or so. I've seen the prison system these days, half are repeat career criminals that are in and out of jail until they really do something bad to keep them there.

For one thing, it's a lot better than the movie trailer, in that it's a lot more slick than what we give it credit for.That said, it's not perfect and will divide viewers.  Some will find the interpretation of the post modern world irritating, and comparisons will abound with other sci-fi offerings.  Here's my take anyway.Some reasons to watch this:a) The imagery - looked great even on a regular DVD.  Why: Shot on a Red 4k camera, this is one of the sharpest and most vivid images I have seen on standard definition.  Who cares about Blu-ray?b) Gerard Butler - poor guy's been doing the same kill-or-be-killed pony tricks since 300.  But we welcome it.  He drives about 90 % of the filmc) The Directors - If you're a fan of Neveldine/Taylor's hyper kinetic style in the CRANK films - then it makes sense to look at the technical chops of the film.  If you've never heard of them - then this is really a ""who cares?"" situation.d) The cinematography is great.What could have been better:a) The ending - pretty flat, like someone pulled out a plug.  Someone spot the Blade Runner Stanley Kubrick tributeb) Flat supporting characters - when Gerard's in play, the whole world falls away.  Bad guy Michael Hall (DEXTER) is a little cartoonish at times.  Amber Valetta looks like a shopworn supermodel!  I did however, like Kyra Sedgwick, and Kevin Bacon would have been welcome here.c) Suspense - every sci-fi movie could do with more.d) Getting Ridley Scott on board.  GAMER could have been more like the post modern version of Gladiator.Gerard looks very similar to another burly dude....Russell Crowe.BOTTOM LINE: Take this film too seriously at your own peril!

Others sacrifice these things in order to keep the action going and focus on entertaining people without having a message.  Then there are movies like ""Gamer"" that try to do both.The movie takes place sometime in the future where the most popular games are Slayers and Society where gamers are able to control other human beings.  Meanwhile an underground group is trying to bring the gamemaker down fearing that he will use this technology to turn everyone into his slaves.  Gerard Butler plays Kable who is the best character in Slayers.  He has been wrongly imprisoned and knows a secret that can bring the gamemaker down.  So the movie is trying to make a point about the dangers of technology.Then the movie throws all logic out the window with numerous holes in the plot.  Kable is somehow able to escape by powering a vehicle with his own vomit and urine after drink a fifth of vodka.  Apparently in the future alcohol doesn't go into your bloodstream, it can just be peed out to fuel you car and it doesn't affect your driving ability either.  Then the gamemaker tries to capture Kable and many innocent people are killed in the process.  So I guess in the future being rich allows you to break any laws you want.  After somehow failing to catch Kable (even with more resources than anyone else on the planet) he lures him into some elaborate test to prove his new technology can totally control anyone.  Even though it would be much easier to just kill him.  Of course his plan backfires and he ends up getting killed by Kable.  And the games are ended because Kable tells a few of the gamemakers employees (who just sat idly by watching their boss getting murdered) to shut them down even though they generate billions in revenue.So if you love mindless action movies that have a strong social message then ""Gamer"" is for you.",2,Tries to be intelligent then wants you to turn your brain off,1265760000,"02 10, 2010",2010,1939,"['action', 'movies', 'try', 'be', 'realistic', 'pay', 'attention', 'things', 'logic', 'having', 'storyline', 'Others', 'sacrifice', 'things', 'order', 'keep', 'action', 'going', 'focus', 'entertaining', 'people', 'having', 'message', 'Then', 'are', 'movies', 'Gamer', 'try', 'do', 'both.The', 'movie', 'place', 'sometime', 'future', 'where', 'most', 'popular', 'games', 'are', 'Slayers', 'Society', 'where', 'gamers', 'are', 'able', 'control', 'other', 'human', 'beings', 'Meanwhile', 'underground', 'group', 'trying', 'bring', 'gamemaker', 'down', 'fearing', 'will', 'use', 'technology', 'turn', 'everyone', 'slaves', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'Kable', 'who', 'best', 'character', 'Slayers', 'been', 'wrongly', 'imprisoned', 'secret', 'can', 'bring', 'gamemaker', 'down', 'movie', 'trying', 'make', 'point', 'dangers', 'technology.Then', 'movie', 'out', 'window', 'numerous', 'holes', 'plot', 'Kable', 'somehow', 'able', 'escape', 'powering', 'vehicle', 'own', 'vomit', 'urine', 'drink', 'fifth', 'vodka', 'Apparently', 'future', 'alcohol', ""n't"", 'go', 'bloodstream', 'can', 'just', 'be', 'peed', 'out', 'fuel', 'car', ""n't"", 'affect', 'driving', 'ability', 'either', 'Then', 'gamemaker', 'capture', 'Kable', 'many', 'innocent', 'people', 'are', 'killed', 'process', 'guess', 'future', 'being', 'rich', 'allows', 'break', 'laws', 'want', 'somehow', 'failing', 'catch', 'Kable', 'even', 'more', 'resources', 'anyone', 'else', 'planet', 'elaborate', 'test', 'prove', 'new', 'technology', 'can', 'totally', 'control', 'anyone', 'Even', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'easier', 'just', 'kill', 'course', 'plan', 'backfires', 'up', 'getting', 'killed', 'Kable', 'games', 'are', 'ended', 'because', 'Kable', 'few', 'gamemakers', 'employees', 'who', 'just', 'sat', 'idly', 'watching', 'boss', 'getting', 'murdered', 'shut', 'down', 'even', 'generate', 'billions', 'revenue.So', 'love', 'mindless', 'action', 'movies', 'have', 'strong', 'social', 'message', 'then', 'Gamer']",N/A
1286804,A3M6RVUVZOQZLB,B002SG7Z7A,"Judy K. Polhemus ""Book Collector""","[4, 6]","My great-nephew is a gamer. I've seen mayhem and murder on his screen, car wrecks and massive body counts that magically disappear in order to get to the next point of contact for more mayhem and murder. I ask him: ""Is that it? You just keep going and killing?"" ""Yeah, pretty much,"" he says. ""What's the point then?"" I ask. ""To see how many you can kill.""To see how many you can kill. Sweet. Which takes me to ""Gamer,"" Gerard Butler's latest film. He makes so many, it is hard to keep up. When I was reviewing my pay-per-view choices, I was so surprised to find this movie--with my man! Click. I made the purchase. Watching it reminded me of my great-nephew. Gamers. There all resemblances end. My nephew plays for fun and skill-making. Butler as an innocent convict plays to get out of prison, provides he lives through all 30 games. It is not fun, but life and death. People literally die in this game.While other reviewers pretty much dissed this movie, I kind of liked it (but then Butler is in it). My first thought--as it is with movies like this (put a man/woman in a trapped life-or-death situation) and watch them live or die, according to the director's determination (only we know that the main character will likely live to tell his story). It's going from Point A to Point Z or somewhere in-between that gives us that voyeuristic thrill. What stories like this always remind me of is ""Running Man"" with Arnold Schwarzeneggar, a film made at least 20 years ago. That story has this plot line: Man (and woman) are put in a trapped situation with a life or death scenario to play out. Sound familiar? The main character's will power and specialness (as famous movie star playing an innocent trapped victim) will--dare I say it?--always see him conquer, survive, and thrive.So it will be with Butler's character. But getting there is the thrill for the viewer. Butler had to die in ""300"" because of history, but in a fantasy/apocalyptic-type movie, he obviously will win, not only his freedom, but... I know I'm on thin ice revealing Butler's victory, but a five-year-old child knows he will win. After all, this is Gerard Butler.One reviewer found it laughable that Butler pukes and (urinates) in a car's gas tank to make it run. That, dear director, was rather lame, but I made an excuse for you as I watched: Cars of the future have the capability of converting the gases of puke and (urine) into fuel. Yep, a stretch, but I give it. After all, it is Butler's puke and (urine).The other actor whose work I admire and who enhances the movie with merely his presence is Michael C. Hall, focus player in the Dexter series. Just Hall's voice alone, but let's add his facial expressions, and the product is an excellent bit of acting, adding more validity to the movie. My favorite part, though, my very favorite part is Hall singing and dancing to ""I Get a Kick out of You"" with his back-up dance line of demented, brain-tampered convicts. Oh, how clever. What a bit of Tarantino thought process. What a brilliant piece of imaginative film action. What a surprise bit of black humor.Overall, I actually enjoyed this movie and give it four stars, a generous gesture on my part, mainly because it is an interesting vehicle for the talents of Gerard Butler and Michael C. Hall.

Once I saw it, I was really disappointed.The movie has very little structure, and way too much shaky-cam.

The reason I mention this is because Gamer was WAY OVER THE TOP with the shaky cam.  We're talking ""Blaire Witch"" shaky.There is no artistic value added by the shaky cam, and it seems to be a device used to try to dress up an otherwise marginal movie.As yet another rehash of ""The Running Man"", this doesn't even come close.  The recent remake of ""Death Race"", which was re imagined as a rehash of ""The Running Man"" concept did a far superior job telling a story, conveying action, had better special effects, and actually had what I would call a ""plot"".

Life, love, movement, advancement--anything is possible, if only you choose to look for it.For a man named Ken Castle, the future is only the beginning.Creator of the massively popular virtual reality game `Society'--in which you, as the player, control living, breathing people--Castle has become known both for his ideals and persecutions. Sell your soul to the devil for money, but be controlled by someone you don't even know; let a corporation plant a microchip into your brain and forever be enslaved by the masses;  let a man call you his own and forever live in fear of being controlled, even outside the game.In a future where the prison system is under collapse, there is little choice but to consider alternate masses to fund a system that houses the most infamous, vile people that walk among us.Ken Castle is that alternative.Welcome to the world of GAMER, but most importantly, welcome to the game `Slayers,' in which the players of massive multiplayer online first person shooters take control of living, breathing convicts. Designed to give death row inmates one final chance at freedom, `Slayers' pits convicts against one another in all-out, no-holds-barred warfare. Controlled by gamers from all around the world, the inmates have little choice but to instill faith in someone other than themselves as they're slowly but surely led to either freedom, or death.For one man, freedom means everything in the world.With a wife and daughter on the outside, Kable most not only fight for his good name, but also for his life. And when controlled by possibly the most famous teenage gamer in all of history, how can he loose, if only by mistake?When sitting down to view a movie like GAMER, I wasn't sure what all to expect. From the brief previews I've seen and read, I expected to watch a movie that consisted entirely of action, but shown in the style of a first-person shooter. For the most part, I thought I would be seeing teenagers controlling convicts from behind the scenes, but was pleasantly surprised to see that the majority of the fighting is shown on the battlefield, through the convict's eyes. Though what sparse amount of fighting there is in the movie, it's well done, both graphically and choreographically.PROS:- The movie does an amazing job at demonstrating what a world with this kind of setting would seem like. The atmosphere that exudes from each individual aspect of the world fully immerses you inside the story, which is something few movies tend to do when it comes to the overall world. Society, Slayers, the regular world--it paints a dystopian future that's both frightening and mystifying at the same time.- Though there's not as much action in the movie as is led to believe, the action that IS there is incredibly well done. With amazing CGI, choreography and stunning death scenes, the action is one of the pleasant highlights of the movie.- Michael C. Hall. Yes, I said it--Michael C. Hall. Having only previously seen him in DEXTER, I wasn't sure what all to expect, but was pleasantly surprised at seeing him play a character like this. He's an amazing actor that really puts a face on the more deviant character in the movie.CONS:- While watching the movie, I couldn't help but feel slightly... disconnected from it. This isn't to say that the movie was immersive in particular aspects (i.e, the atmosphere of the world,) but I didn't feel as connected to it as I thought I should have. This may be in part due to the fact that the world was rather bleak and without a lot of moralistic hope, but it bothered me to sit back and not feel like I was completely inside that world, living a life that I should have been living in the hour-and-a-half I was watching the movie.- Side plots. I couldn't help but feel that a lot of the side story that they'd placed in the film wasn't necessary. The aspect of `Society' and Kable's wife, while interesting, didn't seem necessary, nor did the man that played Kable's wife in the game. Though it did its purpose in revealing that there are deviants and rather unpleasant people that exist behind the screen, it didn't do a whole lot to advance the story in terms of plot and/or character development.- The ending. Though I won't spoil it, the ending ends on an uninspiring low note. When the final climax occurs (and trust me, you'll know when that is,) what you expect to happen doesn't. In a way, the ending seems like a cheap attempt to finish the story without tying the final plot ends that weren't completed. Several new plots were revealed within the final fifteen minutes of the movie, yet the film ends so abruptly that it leaves you disappointed and wanting more.GAMER isn't a film that you will be die-hard and gung-ho to watch over and over again, but the metaphors surrounding virtual reality and the real world makes it an interesting movie to watch. Though its story is filled with thought-provoking questions and atmosphere rich with texture, the disconnection the viewer feels whilst watching it, as well as the unnecessary side plots and the disappointing ending keeps it from being a perfect film. Regardless, GAMER offers the viewer a chance to see the future from a different, bleak perspective, which ultimately makes it a film worth watching.",3,Enter the game... but don't expect it to be

Swanson,"[0, 0]","3.8 starsNeveldine and Taylor have a hyperkinetic style first defined in Crank and now evolving into an increasingly colorful, psychedelically wacked-out world full of visual puns and non-stop action. This film was originally called the Game, a better title but I guess the studios wanted to target the video gaming crowd. The script is nutty but very bright at moments, and Butler and Hall are both excellent. And the blu-ray is dazzlingly clean.The best thing here is the intense clarity of the vision; N/T shoot in hand-held HD most of the time, and have become masters of that craft. There are some scenes with phenomenal lighting and design that are well worth seeing just for their beauty. But then of course one is jarred back to non-reality by yet another dozen fake/real video game/reality show murders. It's all pretty harsh but also as advertised, so there's little shock value, just unrelenting intensity, the N/T hallmark.And Hall does make his mark (ouch, sorry!) with yet another portrayal of evil genius, but where Dexter is quiet this villain is wild. Hall leaps gleefully into the N/T universe and adds to the goofiness factor nicely, especially with his Sammy Davis musical number at the end, out of synch with the film but still rather entertaining. Butler keeps it simple but compelling and the two of them do their jobs well, making Gamers well worth watching if you don't mind a thousand or so bodies falling along the way.Neveldine and Taylor might not always hit the mark, but they aim both high and low, and I have no doubt that soon enough they will make an absolute blockbuster of an action film that will make folks revisit Gamers and the Cranks and realize how very imaginative these flicks really are.",4,Incredible blu-ray picture for an ultraviolent but thoughtful film,1273968000,"05 16, 2010",2010,1732,"['3.8', 'starsNeveldine', 'Taylor', 'have', 'hyperkinetic', 'style', 'first', 'defined', 'Crank', 'now', 'evolving', 'increasingly', 'colorful', 'psychedelically', 'wacked-out', 'world', 'full', 'visual', 'puns', 'non-stop', 'action', 'film', 'was', 'originally', 'called', 'Game', 'better', 'title', 'guess', 'studios', 'wanted', 'target', 'video', 'gaming', 'crowd', 'script', 'nutty', 'very', 'bright', 'moments', 'Butler', 'Hall', 'are', 'excellent', 'blu-ray', 'dazzlingly', 'clean.The', 'best', 'thing', 'here', 'intense', 'clarity', 'vision', 'N/T', 'shoot', 'hand-held', 'HD', 'most', 'time', 'have', 'become', 'masters', 'craft', 'are', 'scenes', 'phenomenal', 'lighting', 'design', 'are', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing', 'just', 'beauty', 'then', 'course', 'one', 'jarred', 'back', 'non-reality', 'yet', 'dozen', 'fake/real', 'video', 'game/reality', 'show', 'murders', 'pretty', 'harsh', 'also', 'advertised', 'little', 'shock', 'value', 'just', 'unrelenting', 'intensity', 'N/T', 'hallmark.And', 'Hall', 'make', 'mark', 'ouch', 'sorry', 'yet', 'portrayal', 'evil', 'genius', 'where', 'Dexter', 'quiet', 'villain', 'wild', 'Hall', 'gleefully', 'N/T', 'universe', 'goofiness', 'factor', 'nicely', 'especially', 'Sammy', 'Davis', 'musical', 'number', 'end', 'synch', 'film', 'still', 'rather', 'entertaining', 'Butler', 'simple', 'compelling', 'two', 'do', 'jobs', 'well', 'making', 'Gamers', 'well', 'watching', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'thousand', 'so', 'bodies', 'falling', 'way.Neveldine', 'Taylor', 'might', 'not', 'always', 'hit', 'mark', 'aim', 'high', 'low', 'have', 'doubt', 'soon', 'will', 'make', 'absolute', 'blockbuster', 'action', 'film', 'will', 'make', 'folks', 'revisit', 'Gamers', 'Cranks', 'realize', 'how', 'very', 'imaginative', 'flicks', 'really', 'are']",N/A

I usually like movies with an interesting concept or at least some in depth back story.  I'm not above watching a stupid movie, however, if it's at least entertaining with a few martial arts fights or some good explosions.  This movie was based upon a fundamentally flawed concept... people will want to give up their autonomy for money in the future.  The concept is that a brilliant, now rich, antagonist invents a method to allow people to control humans who willingly submit to some brain cell modifications.  This evil genius first invents a TV reality show based upon those individuals who give up their freedom so that other users may log on and control them.  It's a giant ""sims"" game with real people - except the people get paid when you log in.  His next concept being the war zone based upon prison inmates on death row - I'll get back to this.The sims game, called ""Society"" has loads of underhanded messages installed in it.  One very quickly notices that the people who work in the sims group are all young, attractive, many of them having breast implants, and they are basically used for internet porn.  On top of this they are all dressed as if from a 1960-70's psychadelic plastic babrbie commercial or something.  All of the people who log in to use the ""Society"" member are deviants, as opitomized by a disturbing morbidly obese actor who is constantly naked and usually eating something gross like a tray of waffles and a salad bowl of syrup.The fight zone - which most readers will be more familiar with as it is the centerpiece of the movie - ends up being a pretty small character in the show.  It's exactly what you might expect.  There are even a few homages to actual video games, such as a convict run by a player who stops to ""Tea Bag"" a downed opponent (Tea Bagging in video games is when you squat over a downed opponent to simulate the sex act - as it's the most disturbing thing you can do to someone who is frustratingly dead and watching you insult his body).

1286823,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B002SG7Z7A,Mark Turner,"[2, 3]","Have you ever seen one of those previews for a film that made it seem as if it was the greatest idea in the world? All the flash and bang, all the explosions, all the quick quips that make it seem exciting and witty and worth your money to see? But then when you see the film you realize that all the best parts were spliced together in such a way that the preview was more entertaining than the actual movie? Such is the case with GAMER.In the future mega whiz Ken Castle (Michael C. Hall) is a computer genius who has created two games that everyone plays. The first is recognizable as a Sims style game but with a difference. Volunteers have had nanobytes placed in their brains that allow them to be controlled by game players to do their bidding. This includes everything from standing on their head to having sex. The nanobytes also give the game players the opportunity to view all that goes on.The second game, Slayers, is a more adventurous one. In this one, the nanobytes have been implanted on prisoners sitting on death row. Game players control these people in a dangerous setting, each armed with real weapons as they make their way to a goal through high powered obstacles placed in their way. Their objective is to play the game out and win so many times and in return the player (or prisoner in this case) is granted his or her freedom.As the film begins Kable (Gerard Butler) is the most popular of the pieces in play. Simon (Logan Lerman) is Kable's controller/game player and the duo has gone further than any others in the game. Kable is nearing the chance to be free but of course the powers that be can't have that (shades of ROLLERBALL!). Instead the rig the game to make sure he loses.But Kable has a plan of his own. Via flashbacks we get a glimpse of the life he led before, some of which he can recall but not everything. Kable has a family and a life he misses and somehow Castle was involved in taking it away. Not until a final confrontation are we privy to what that connection is.Along the way we get to see Kable's wife Angie (Amber Alleta) as she plays the Sims style game as a pawn for an overweight slob who controls her into some seriously strange situations. Those involved in this game seem intent on displaying the most depraved situations everywhere. Of course, this is graphically viewed by anyone watching this DVD. Suffice to say gratuitous nudity for the sake of gratuitous nudity is on hand.Another plot line involves rebels out to take down Castle and his plans at world domination via game players and nanobytes. They interfere with Kable and Simon in the hopes that Kable will survive no matter what is thrown at him and then have the chance to find Castle.So what about the movie as a whole? It's quite disappointing with many of the action sequences the preview promoted short and far between. The plot seems thin at best and copied from various other films in the past at worst. The pacing is slow, the set up lame and the payoff predictable from early on.The acting in this film is standard with no outstanding performances. Those involved offer little or no emotion, seeming more like the characters seen in video games that they discuss. Even Butler, who I think is becoming a better actor as he goes, offers nothing that makes this one something to seek out.The effects take center stage here, most notably the camerawork. So much so that one of the main extra features discusses the camera system they used to get the look they wanted. If you've seen either CRANK film (by the same directors) you know the look I'm talking about.

1286824,A1DUWRMZVLRKAJ,B002SG7Z7A,maskedgamer,"[0, 1]","What can I say about Gamer? Well... To start off Gamer is a miss mash of Death Race and the worst parts of Crank (what few there is).The story takes place in the distant future where just about the entire world is wired on technology. So much so that pixilated characters are now being replaced with real life controllable living and breathing human-beings. Now there's good and bad parts to this. What breaks the boundaries of what is moral and immoral in this cyber world is that just about everyone can find some pleasure in ""cyber world"" because just about everyone's brain is wired using nano technology (or so it would seem they never explain really).What's to like about this movie? Well if your an actual Gamer like a select few of us than you probably understood it's oddness a bit better, and some of the scenes that most people didn't get. In those parts is was pretty funny watching them bring what people do in games to reality. The only problem is that it was more or less an inside joke. There's also plenty of action in this film but it's Call of Duty style/halo style. There will be tons of action on screen, but it is sort of hard to follow since the camera jumps around so much and switches back and fourth between the players and the action.My biggest problem with gamer is that you really don't know how to take it. Is it supposed to be an Action Comedy? Every one in the film seems to have some sort of over the top comedic characteristic to themselves but Gerard Butler he is dead serious to the very end. I honestly think this was made for Jason Statham. It's more suitable to his movie acting style than Gerard Butler. That was probably the only mistake about the quirkiness of the movie is that it didn't have the right actor for the lead role. Leonidas doesn't belong in Action-Comedy films.overall I'd like to give this 3 1/2 stars it's entertaining none the least.

1286826,A1U360OMVQRPUB,B002SG7Z7A,Mel Odom,"[4, 8]","Gamer arrived in theaters on Friday after a, literally, explosive rush of trailers.  However, those trailers inaccurately reported that Gerard Butler hadn't kicked this much butt in 300 years.  The quote was taken from 300, the Frank Miller movie.  Actually, the battle of Thermopylae took place over 2000 years ago.Once upon a time, I was a diehard gamer.  Lately, my 11 year old son is the diehard gamer in the house.  He has more time to play than I do, but I keep him stocked in all the latest game systems and games.  He's leading the life I would want if I had more time.Both of us were excited about seeing Gamer.  The whole idea of controlling a flesh and blood avatar during a real battle just sounded cool.  Neither of us would really want to do that, but we couldn't wait to see it played out on the big screen.The movie is written and directed by Neveldine/Taylor, the duo that gave us Crank and Crank 2.  Gamer possesses the same frantic pacing of the writer/directors' first two movies.  In fact, if you have seen the Crank franchise, you will have seen much of the style and visual effects of this movie.  Gamer just seems too familiar visually.Another too familiar aspect is the lack of character development throughout the movie.  Gerard Butler is posited as the hero, Kable, and Michael C. Hall (TV's Dexter) is the bad guy.  The history of each, and of the shared moments between them, come too late in the movie.  There's no investment on part of the viewer, and by that point the clash is coming to a head, so all attention is given to the climax.Gerard Butler is definitely action hero material and his physical performance is good.  After seeing the film, I'd believe that Butler can walk into a room full of bad guys and take them all out.Michael C. Hall as Castle, the man who invented the games Society and Slayers where flesh and blood avatars are mind controlled by other people, delivers a stunning bit of acting.  He was a wicked combination of cool, competent, and cruel.  The singing bit at the end totally blew my mind.  I kept wishing I had a DVR controller so I could rewind that scene and watch it again.  I'll be buying the DVD primarily to watch Hall in action.  I just wish there had been more of him in the film.Kyra Sedgwick (The Closer) and Ludacris were virtually wasted as cardboard characters.  And I didn't see anything of Logan Lerman's character Simon that I could buy into, except for that really cool computer room he seems to live in.I did enjoy the concepts that were explored in the film.  The Society game was much like Second Life, only with graphic sex thrown into the mix.  I found the scenes of the people playing the avatars in Society more disturbing than those who played in Slayers.  If I don't know if the filmmakers intended this kind of reaction on part of the viewer, but it's strange how controlling someone in a twisted version of everyday life is somehow more perverted than controlling someone on a deadly battlefield.Granted, the film had to straddle a thin line between action fans and, perhaps, science fiction fans, but I wish more attention would have been paid to the what-if scenario played out in the movie.  The deeper issues of the questions raised were skimmed over in favor of blood and gore.Gamer is a fun film for action junkies, but definitely lighter fare for someone interested in dealing with the intriguing possibility of the future.",3,AutoPlay,1252281600,"09 7, 2009",2009,3422,"['Gamer', 'arrived', 'theaters', 'Friday', 'literally', 'explosive', 'rush', 'trailers', 'However', 'trailers', 'inaccurately', 'reported', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'had', ""n't"", 'kicked', 'much', 'butt', '300', 'years', 'quote', 'was', 'taken', '300', 'Frank', 'Miller', 'movie', 'Actually', 'battle', 'Thermopylae', 'took', 'place', '2000', 'years', 'ago.Once', 'time', 'was', 'diehard', 'gamer', 'Lately', '11', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'diehard', 'gamer', 'house', 'more', 'time', 'play', 'do', 'keep', 'stocked', 'latest', 'game', 'systems', 'games', 'leading', 'life', 'would', 'want', 'had', 'more', 'time.Both', 'were', 'excited', 'seeing', 'Gamer', 'whole', 'idea', 'controlling', 'flesh', 'blood', 'avatar', 'real', 'battle', 'just', 'sounded', 'cool', 'would', 'really', 'want', 'do', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'played', 'out', 'big', 'screen.The', 'movie', 'written', 'directed', 'Neveldine/Taylor', 'duo', 'gave', 'Crank', 'Crank', '2', 'Gamer', 'same', 'frantic', 'pacing', 'writer/directors', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'fact', 'have', 'seen', 'Crank', 'franchise', 'will', 'have', 'seen', 'much', 'style', 'visual', 'effects', 'movie', 'Gamer', 'just', 'too', 'familiar', 'visually.Another', 'too', 'familiar', 'aspect', 'lack', 'character', 'development', 'movie', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'posited', 'hero', 'Kable', 'Michael', 'C.', 'Hall', 'TV', 'Dexter', 'bad', 'guy', 'history', 'shared', 'moments', 'come', 'too', 'late', 'movie', 'investment', 'part', 'viewer', 'point', 'clash', 'coming', 'head', 'attention', 'given', 'climax.Gerard', 'Butler', 'definitely', 'action', 'hero', 'material', 'physical', 'performance', 'good', 'seeing', 'film', ""'d"", 'believe', 'Butler', 'can', 'walk', 'room', 'full', 'bad', 'guys', 'take', 'out.Michael', 'C.', 'Hall', 'Castle', 'man', 'who', 'invented', 'games', 'Society', 'Slayers', 'where', 'flesh', 'blood', 'avatars', 'are', 'mind', 'controlled', 'other', 'people', 'stunning', 'bit', 'acting', 'was', 'wicked', 'combination', 'cool', 'competent', 'cruel', 'singing', 'bit', 'end', 'totally', 'blew', 'mind', 'kept', 'wishing', 'had', 'DVR', 'controller', 'could', 'rewind', 'scene', 'watch', 'again', ""'ll"", 'be', 'buying', 'DVD', 'primarily', 'watch', 'Hall', 'action', 'just', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'film.Kyra', 'Sedgwick', 'Closer', 'Ludacris', 'were', 'virtually', 'wasted', 'cardboard', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'anything', 'Logan', 'Lerman', 'character', 'Simon', 'could', 'buy', 'really', 'cool', 'computer', 'room', 'live', 'in.I', 'did', 'enjoy', 'concepts', 'were', 'explored', 'film', 'Society', 'game', 'was', 'much', 'Second', 'Life', 'only', 'graphic', 'sex', 'thrown', 'mix', 'found', 'scenes', 'people', 'playing', 'avatars', 'Society', 'more', 'disturbing', 'who', 'played', 'Slayers', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'filmmakers', 'intended', 'kind', 'reaction', 'part', 'viewer', 'strange', 'how', 'controlling', 'someone', 'twisted', 'version', 'everyday', 'life', 'somehow', 'more', 'perverted', 'controlling', 'someone', 'deadly', 'battlefield.Granted', 'film', 'had', 'straddle', 'thin', 'line', 'action', 'fans', 'perhaps', 'science', 'fiction', 'fans', 'wish', 'more', 'attention', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'paid', 'what-if', 'scenario', 'played', 'out', 'movie', 'deeper', 'issues', 'questions', 'raised', 'were', 'skimmed', 'favor', 'blood', 'gore.Gamer', 'fun', 'film', 'action', 'junkies', 'definitely', 'lighter', 'fare', 'someone', 'interested', 'dealing', 'intriguing', 'possibility', 'future']",N/A

The 3d does add depth but not that true 3d feeling in some ways. The exception to this rule are the imax converted films like titanic' etc. But generally on the big screen the conversion is stronger after shooting than doing it for blu ray.  This does have depth and the darkness of the movies shots don't make the 3d more apparent. But it is 3d and like all 3d , it's effect is to add depth.  So like ""I robot' this is not a must have for 3d collectors. But it still looked better to me in 3d than the 2d version. And It is without doubling , like in some 3d films on blu ray.  The movie itself is over the top and influenced by the many films in which people watch people battle it out on screens that came before.  Only the twist this time is that they replace your brain cells and can control you and use you as a game piece. Michael Hall plays a good villain here as the evil mastermind who wants to control everyone like pupptets. He's not fleshed out , and neither is the cable character , but then this is a pure fast action flick and it's a fun one. Is this  a great film? nope, but it's  a decent action flick. Of course I miss action flicks with lots of character development and such. But this isn't one of those , it's like a video game , in that it gives you constant action and a indestructible hero. Is that bad? no?  Is that good cinema? well it's what it is. For a A movie this would be lumped in the bottom as it's a lot of flash and little characterization  but who says movies can't be like this too?.  There's a place for these movies of course. What is scary though is that there are some people who can't watch a regular action flick unless it's like this videogame of a movie. which is sad. I like drama action flicks too. But too often we'd here 'that's boring' why? because it's not like gamer"" which has constant action. That's so sad. But here it is a decent constant action flick.

Online gaming takes on new meaning in a futuristic world.  In that world, players at home can direct convicts to do their bidding in a wickedly violent, multiplayer competition, and death-row inmate Kable (Gerard Butler) has no choice but to play.  As millions satisfy their sadistic fantasies via prisoner avatars, Kable must find a way to escape and expose the hidden agenda of the reclusive fat cat who dreamed up the game (Michael C. Hall).Taking pieces from Running Man, Death Race, and even from their first two films in the Crank series, Mark Neveldine and  Brian Taylor depict a grim look at society, and where we could be going from where we are today.  In between all the lustful scenes and carnage, Neveldine and Taylor try to create a commentary on where our society is going.  The rich and controlling puppet masters, to the puppets whose lives are completely in control by the puppet masters.Gamer is a natural progression for the directors of the Crank films to create, and the movie is the perfect blend of cinema meets a video game, with all of the chaotic screen candy to boot.  We are treated to three different realms:  Society (where ""gamers"" control actors in an ""anything goes world"" - The Sims to the extreme level); Slayers (where convicts are controlled in the ultimate bloody battle grounds); and the real world (somewhere where mundane life just exists).Normally a film such as Gamer would feature ""B"" rated actors, however, it appears that Liongrate has gone all out with this film.  Gerald Butler (300, Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life) is at the top of his game, along with Amber Valletta (Transporter 2), and Alison Lohman (Drag Me to Hell).  Also along for the ride, although a bit underused, were Zoe Bell (Grindhouse),  Milo Ventimiglia (Hereos, Rocky Balboa), John Leguizamo (Spawn), and Kyra Sedgwick (The Closer).  The only two performances that were lacking in the over-the-top performance by  Michael C. Hall (Dexter) and the rapper turned actor Ludacris.As with most films in the genre, Gamer will never be one for the masses.

The creator of the game is Ken Castle (Dexter star Michael C.

While Gamer is jam packed with violent bursts of bloody action and carnage, buried underneath are some thought provoking ideas that could be otherwise used as cautionary tale.  Getting there however may prove somewhat difficult, considering most of the action sequences are almost incomprehensible due to the constant cuts, flashy edits, and other elements that are just cliche now for the whole dystopian future genre.  Assembled here is a surprising cast though, including Kyra Sedgwick, Alison Lohman, Ludacris, and Terry Crews, along with small roles for John Leguizamo and Milo Ventimiglia.

a trip/game it was to get from A to B in this film.A non stop action flick from beginning to end,Gamer(released Sept/09)comes from the same imaginative team that gave us the high adrenaline Crank films,Brian Taylor and Mark Neveldine;and there is no lack of that heart-fueling adrenaline in this flick either.The story involves one John Tilman(aka Kable)who is the current rage in a game called Slayers.The game is real as are the players within the game.Each player has a real person controlling them from afar and John's happens to be a 17 year gaming whiz named Simon(Logan Lehrman).Through the immersing technology on hand Simon literally sees and hears everything John hears as he takes his ""player""(John)through an intense fire-fight course from grisly beginning to bloody end.After surviving 30 games John will be allowed to leave the game and Simon has taken John,unprecedentedly,almost all the way through.The creator of this gaming world,Ken Castle(Michael Hall),was also the creator of another wildly popular interactive game,the Sims-like Society.However Castle's dreams are over exceeding his grasp as his real motives lie in trying to control the rest of society.He hopes to be able to inject his brain controlling nanobots into millions of people thereby controlling everyone.But a rebel group called Humanz is out to stop Castle's grasp of power.They contact Simon and give him a mod that enables Simon to actually talk with John during game play.Inevitably this leads to John finally breaking out of the game during what was to be his last fight and tracking down his family.With the help of the people in Humanz he is able to get he and his wife's independence back and which leads to the inevitable showdown with the person who has his only daughter;Castle himself.Things are nip and tuck but Tilman in the end,with a little help from the remaining elements of Humanz,defeats Castle and brings down his dynasty.This is a look at todays gaming world flung into the future and brought to a higher,more violent,more interactive and a more highly intense experience;assisted ably through its' great plot,SFX,editing and non stop action.The writing and directing team of Taylor and Neveldine have created a wonderful Sci Fi winner of a concept and they never let the action or your interest wane for more than a few seconds,if ever.I found myself riveted to the action/plot throughout and that's something that few movies can accomplish these days.Also what can't be stated enough is the absolutely fantastic look and feel of this film,all done through the actual camera itself.I first heard of this relatively new camera system called ""Red"" back in early 2007 and this is the first mainstream film I have actually seen it used in and it is awesome,to say the least.The look is a combination of alot of things but sepia tones and alot of saturated pastels dominate throughout.The camera shots,twists and turns are done at break neck speeds as the creators strive to give we the viewer a more movie-immersing experience.And it works,all of it works as this is a film,I for one,will definitely watch more than a few times to try to catch something I missed from the previous viewing.Finally I must also give a nod to the films lead actor Gerard Butler whose intensity throughout really enhances the entire proceedings.On the technical side of things the film is clear and crisp and beautifully transferred to DVD with its widescreen format in tact and the sound fantastic.The extras include audio commentary,three 30 minute featurettes on the making of the film,likewise a featurette on the RED camera system used and the trailer.All in all one of the better Sci-Fi films I have seen in recent times.Its Sci-Fi premise alone will certainly be a drawing card to all the fans of that genre but throw in the gaming world angle as well and well,there's a much wider audience right there.I recommend the movie highly;the game is on!",4,"""Well played,Kable""-",1274659200,"05 24, 2010",2010,4078,"['phrase', 'so', 'John', 'Tilman', 'nightmare', 'family', 'gave', 'courage', 'needed', 'survive', 'game', 'what', 'trip/game',

Sme""","[1, 2]","""Gamer"" is supposed to be an exploration of a world where a game called ""Society"" (basically a copy of ""The Sims"") is created with players controlling live action people.  It's so successful another game is created called ""Slayers"" which is a live action ""Call of Duty,"" all controlled by an eccentric genius.All the cliches are in place; the combat players are death row inmates who have to fight so many rounds for their freedom, the main character (Kable, who is played by Gerard Butler) was framed and is trying to get back to his wife and child, the good guys are dystopian freedom fighters who hack into a global network to send their message, and the bad guy is a madman with world domination plans.I never got clear how the mechanics of the combat game was supposed to work, and it was odd that Kable is seen as a combat hero when his every move is controlled by a 17 year old kid---except for some remark he makes about ""when the trigger is pulled it's all me.""  Having played a lot of the Call of Duty games a live game that would depend on the speed and stamina of a real person who could die only once wouldn't be very popular or energetic.What makes the movie a disaster is the uneven and choppy editing and scenes perpetually intended to shock or disgust.  For example, in one scene in ""Society"" a skateboarder runs into a woman and knocks her down.  She's cut bad and bleeding but the creepy old guy controlling her is making her laugh and lick her wounds for his perverted entertainment.  Kable's wife is played in the ""Sims"" game by a man who is as disgusting and slovenly as possible, and how Kable manages to fuel a truck for his escape beyond belief.Things run so fast and incoherent much of the movie makes no sense.  I couldn't tell if the film makers were making the classic mistake of after having looked at and edited things all day, knowing the story backwards and forwards, they forget the audience is seeing this for the first time and needs to see how it all links together, or they just didn't care and stuck in anything that looked cool to them.I'd say they just didn't care.  The fight scene set to ""I've Got You Under My Skin,"" complete with finger snapping and dancing, is so weird it's funny, yet it jars with the scenes before and after it, just someone's idea to try out.The world ""Gamer"" gives us is dark and ugly, with Kable and is family unit as the only redeemable people, and I'd give this movie a wide pass.",1,Incoherent and simply bad,1333238400,"04 1, 2012",2012,2450,"['Gamer', 'supposed', 'be', 'exploration', 'world', 'where', 'game', 'called', 'Society', 'basically', 'copy', 'Sims', 'created', 'players', 'controlling', 'live', 'action', 'people', 'so', 'successful', 'game', 'created', 'called', 'Slayers', 'live', 'action', 'Call', 'Duty', 'controlled', 'eccentric', 'genius.All', 'cliches', 'are', 'place', 'combat', 'players', 'are', 'death', 'row', 'inmates', 'who', 'have', 'fight', 'so', 'many', 'rounds', 'freedom', 'main', 'character', 'Kable', 'who', 'played', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'was', 'framed', 'trying', 'get', 'back', 'wife', 'child', 'good', 'guys', 'are', 'dystopian', 'freedom', 'fighters', 'who', 'hack', 'global', 'network', 'send', 'message', 'bad', 'guy', 'madman', 'world', 'domination', 'plans.I', 'never', 'got', 'clear', 'how', 'mechanics', 'combat', 'game', 'was', 'supposed', 'work', 'was', 'odd', 'Kable', 'seen', 'combat', 'hero', 'when', 'move', 'controlled', '17', 'year', 'old', 'kid', '-except', 'remark', 'when', 'trigger', 'pulled', 'Having', 'played', 'lot', 'Call', 'Duty', 'games', 'live', 'game', 'would', 'depend', 'speed', 'stamina', 'real', 'person', 'who', 'could', 'die', 'only', 'once', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'very', 'popular', 'movie', 'disaster', 'uneven', 'choppy', 'editing', 'scenes', 'perpetually', 'intended', 'shock', 'disgust', 'example', 'one', 'scene', 'Society', 'skateboarder', 'woman', 'down', 'cut', 'bad', 'bleeding', 'creepy', 'old', 'guy', 'controlling', 'making', 'laugh', 'lick', 'wounds', 'perverted', 'entertainment', 'Kable', 'wife', 'played', 'Sims', 'game', 'man', 'who', 'disgusting', 'slovenly', 'possible', 'how', 'Kable', 'manages', 'fuel', 'truck', 'escape', 'belief.Things', 'run', 'so', 'fast', 'incoherent', 'much', 'movie', 'sense', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'film', 'makers', 'were', 'making', 'classic', 'mistake', 'having', 'looked', 'edited', 'things', 'day', 'knowing', 'story', 'backwards', 'forwards', 'forget', 'audience', 'seeing', 'first', 'time', 'needs', 'see', 'how', 'together', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'stuck', 'anything', 'looked', 'cool', 'them.I', ""'d"", 'say', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'fight', 'scene', 'set', ""'ve"", 'Got', 'My', 'Skin', 'complete', 'finger', 'snapping', 'dancing', 'so', 'weird', 'funny', 'scenes', 'just', 'someone', 'idea', 'try', 'out.The', 'world', 'Gamer', 'dark', 'ugly', 'Kable', 'family', 'unit', 'only', 'redeemable', 'people', ""'d"", 'give', 'movie', 'wide', 'pass']",N/A

It is basically a repeat of the ""Crank"" action-sequence delivery style, though stripped of its humour and set amidst a very thin, re-fried plot:In the near future, an evil computer genius Castle (nicely cast Michael C. Hall of the ""Dexter"" fame), hell bent on taking over the World via mind control, can only be stopped by a father (Gerard Butler of ""300"", as Kable) on a quest to free himself and his family from the false persecution by the aforementioned evil computer genius. Kable is rotting in prison for a murder that was not of his doing. Like many other men and women on death row, he chooses to become an avatar in an uber violent, interactive, multiplayer game called ""Slayers"", Castle's brain child. Should he manage to go the full 30 rounds, he'll win a pardon and his freedom. So far, Kable has survived thru 27 rounds, the only prisoner to live that long. Both he and the teenage boy controlling the human avatar, have become international cult icons. Of course, that is not something Castle can allow to continue...Well, shame we don't care!The characters are unsympathetic and stereotypical (all gamers are amoral, geniuses are evil), the dialog is cut short beyond bare bones to allow for maximum saturation with the endless ""run-point-shoot"" sequences. So, unless you have read reviews prior to viewing, you spend the first hour uncertain which one of the characters is actually deserving of your empathy. Further eschewing the plot and character development, the directors devote long stretches of time to naked female body parts: the butt of Amber Valetta (the hero's wife) gets more screen time then the model's face. You begin to believe the Butt is written as a separate character, with its own make up, trailer, and a stunt double (you'll be relieved to know the part is non-speaking...). Furthermore, the assortment of mangled body parts freshly separated from their owners and flying thru the air every few seconds fails to tantalize. The unfolding blood bath, adequate for a computer game, is too monotonous for an action flick. ""Boring"" and ""repetitive"" are words that quickly sneak into one's mind when pondering ""Gamer""'s action scenes. Yawn...For me, the most shocking part of the film is its reported budget. At a paltry $12 million, it does not seem nearly enough to have afforded the producers the too many to mention appearances by rather well known entertainers. Shame this is not an actor's film. The imposing Terry Crews is reduced to cracking his neck menacingly while staring down the hero. Ludacris has more dialogue, but still not enough to create a memorable character. Kyra Sedwick benefits from a push up bra while delivering her lines with breathless urgency and no hopes of making a serious contribution to the plot.On a weekend night, in an otherwise busy, large city multiplex, I was THE ONLY person seeing ""Gamer"". Still, based on the low budget, ""Gamer"" is bound to make its studio a healthy profit, especially with Gerard Butler's name attached to the project.

We watched maybe half of this and just couldn't stand it any more. It's not that often that we turn off a movie. We like to give it a chance, but this felt like a waste of time.The movie tries to combine concepts from several older movies including Running Man. It tries to give it an updated twist, but it's unsuccessfully done. Death row inmates volunteer to be controlled in a war like video game, and to be controlled by someone else. If they make it through 30 games, they're set free. Gerard Butler plays a death row guy who's almost made it through the 30 games.Really? Convicted killers on death row will be set free if they're not killed? That in itself is unbelievable. Then the editing makes the action difficult to follow. Since there's not much more to this movie than the blow-em-up action scenes, it becomes irritating and dull. The war game scenes are graphic, and people and things are blowing up constantly. The story is shallow, and so are the characters. The evil person who's supposed to be the inventor of the games is just too unreal to believe, and creepy on top of it. I'm not sure if he was overacting, or just trying to make a bad script work. Kyra Sedgwick's character also seemed like a caricature. The story and its characters are entirely unbelievable, hard to follow, and frankly boring.Then there's another game being played in the movie, where people are paid to let someone else control them and tell them what to say and do. I'm sure you can imagine where that goes. And it's done in such a gross, creepy way. The scenes that are supposed to be sexy, are repulsive. Nothing good about it. Strange cinematography, weird images, none of it interesting.The concept has a lot of potential, and Gerard Butler is great in other movies he's done, but this movie doesn't work.",2,Horrible - Don't bother,1264291200,"01 24, 2010",2010,1915,"['Scifi', 'fans', 'gamers', 'even', ""'re"", 'curious', 'even', ""'re"", 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'fan', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'watched', 'maybe', 'half', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'stand', 'more', 'not', 'often', 'turn', 'off', 'movie', 'like', 'give', 'chance', 'felt', 'waste', 'time.The', 'movie', 'tries', 'combine', 'concepts', 'several', 'older', 'movies', 'including', 'Running', 'Man', 'give', 'updated', 'twist', 'unsuccessfully', 'done', 'Death', 'row', 'volunteer', 'be', 'controlled', 'war', 'video', 'game', 'be', 'controlled', 'someone', 'else', 'make', '30', 'games', ""'re"", 'set', 'free', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'death', 'row', 'guy', 'who', 'almost', 'made', '30', 'games.Really', 'Convicted', 'killers', 'death', 'row', 'will', 'be', 'set', 'free', ""'re"", 'not', 'killed', 'unbelievable', 'Then', 'editing', 'action', 'difficult', 'follow', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'movie', 'blow-em-up', 'action', 'scenes', 'irritating', 'dull', 'war', 'game', 'scenes', 'are', 'graphic', 'people', 'things', 'are', 'blowing', 'up', 'constantly', 'story', 'shallow', 'so', 'are', 'characters', 'evil', 'person', 'who', 'supposed', 'be', 'inventor', 'games', 'just', 'too', 'unreal', 'believe', 'creepy', 'top', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'overacting', 'just', 'trying', 'make', 'bad', 'script', 'work', 'Kyra', 'Sedgwick', 'character', 'also', 'seemed', 'caricature', 'story', 'characters', 'are', 'entirely', 'unbelievable', 'hard', 'follow', 'frankly', 'boring.Then', 'game', 'being', 'played', 'movie', 'where', 'people', 'are', 'paid', 'let', 'someone', 'else', 'control', 'tell', 'what', 'say', 'do', ""'m"", 'sure', 'can', 'imagine', 'where', 'done', 'such', 'gross', 'creepy', 'way', 'scenes', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'sexy', 'are', 'repulsive', 'Nothing', 'good', 'Strange', 'cinematography', 'weird', 'images', 'none', 'concept', 'lot', 'potential', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'great', 'other', 'movies', 'done', 'movie', ""n't"", 'work']",N/A

Admittedly, a very poor script and weak plot, but once again this is about watching a violent music video mash of two A-list actors doing their thing - and do they ever.The picture quality does not always get the longest time to be tested, but when the camera holds still long enough (I would have to say there is maybe five still shots in the whole film) the clarity is great - reference the eye scene in the Society chapter, outstanding. The 7.1 DTS is stellar, with more references than I have time to list. Lots of extras, including:* Inside Gamer, 3 parts totaling 79 minutes. Mostly in hidef clarity, covering an array of production material, laden towards the interview style more than scene footage.* First person shooter, 16:45 minutes. Covers the camera work and kinds of cameras used, I enjoy these kinds.* Unseen trailer. Almost a red band trailer but would have been more representative of the film.* Icon option, 132 minutes. Essentially the film with commentary, but in a PiP style, or in some cases a walk-on presentation by the dynamic duo (creators). They control the speed of the film also, sometimes rewinding it as they talk or pausing it - hence the longer version of a 94-minute film. You have to really be into these guys for this option.* Cheat codes, turned on/off. As you watch the film, an icon appears you can select a different PiP crew narrative (editing, music, filming, effects, stunts, etc.) and the relative crew member will describe some behind the scenes stuff for that moment. Had to select all five for the Society sequence - great scene.* BD Touch. Material related to portable and apps stuff. Have not downloaded/tried any of this new thing yet.* LG Live. Allows you to turn on (have to have a live network connection) gadgets that operate during menu manipulation. Includes live weather/temp for your town, current time and a live news feed for all stuff movie related.

This creates a billionaire overnight and makes the public crave more. Their solution - Slayers. In Slayers, you control a real live person as they engage in real live battles where they normally don't really stay alive. The people - death row inmates. The players - ordinary folks with ordinary lives. The objective  get to the save point. If you make it through thirty battles, you live. Seems simple enough.When I watched The Gamer, I felt like I was watching two movies. The first part dealt with the two games and their ramifications on society. The second dealt with the life of the one player to make it through almost 30 games and the things that happen when you hit that plateau. As far as the first part was concern, I was interested and then some. The way the technology worked was enough for a Sci-fi answer, the additions to the game were interesting (like the people who walk around with limited functionality, trying to live through one game), and the horror of it was brought home. We also saw the way that the game used control, how people and killer were one lovely unit, and how that impacted the life of two individuals. There was also the group that didn't like this approach because it wrecked some social fabrics and ""would eventually make us all slaves,"" and because of the not-so-humane portions of blowing chunks of people all over the screen.I liked that part.I also like Michael C. Hall because he was funny as our lovely creator, and I liked a lot of the performances. What I didn't like was the way the game ended, the way the story bled out, or the way Hall ended up explaining everything. The movie also made me want to know something. (Spoiler if you are reading ending of the paragraph) When our killer thriller was given a picture of his family by one of the resistance, he had a flashback that took him back to being with his wife. It was the same scene as the ending, where his wife was holding his arm. So, does that mean the game could have possibly been everything happening? I honestly would have liked that better than Michael C. Hall going all Professor X on us at the end.So, should you watch it? Well, i liked part of it a lot and part of it a little. It had a stellar cast and they do a great job, so maybe you will enjoy enough of it to watch. I personally would say rent it, if for nothing more than the conceptual basis it floats upon.

Anyone familiar with online first-person shooters will recognize everything from camera angles to teabagging in the Slayers world. Similarly, even a passing familiarity with Second Life (a hive of perversion that they actually toned down for the film) makes the grotesque free for all of Society that much more plausible. This is where the satircal edge of the film comes in -- and it's a razor.

I don't want character development or great acting; I just want some decent action, which is not here.Yes, there are lots of flying bullets, big explosions and dead bodies, but the stunts are all ruined by shaky camera, hectic editing and an incoherent narrative with long expository dialogue.

If this is an example of the future of major motion picture making, then I'm sorry to say we're all freakin double-screwed. GAMER is a movie that wanted to be The Empire State Building, but (in the misguided directing hands of Neveldine/Taylor) what looked great on paper turned out to be just another above-ground parking deck...An eyesore for the community.It's hard to even know WHERE TO START when reviewing this film because it's just so POORLY DONE.

The most obvious question is: WHY?!? So you're making a videogame action movie...WHY drive it straight off into the gutter because you feel compelled to litter the screen with your sickest fantasies?The STUPIDEST thing about this film is how you're supposed to believe that in the future they broadcast crystal clear images onto the sides of buildings and you can go into your ""browsing room"" and control multiple image files with your feet and interact with each one while they even interact with each other...Pretty cool up to the point where these two bumbling film makers start bombarding your senses EVERY FEW SECONDS with video glitches that simulate poor connections, interrupted signals, audio/video echoes, grainy images, etc that look like someone needs to get up and adjust the rabbit ears...again and again and again. It begs the question: WHY?!? In a future filled with an abundance of technology that we can only dream of, WHY are you popping our bubble by showing us that this future comes complete with lag and connections that mock us with quality worse than when we were struggling to watch small video files over a 14.4k modem?!?And for a good laugh, just watch the ""Making Of"" interviews on the DVD...Neveldine & Taylor portray themselves as the guy down the street that hit the lottery, but he walks around town telling everyone that it all happened ""just the way he planned it""...Yeah, right! We get it guys...You hit the lottery with Crank (a movie I absolutely love), and now you have full license to show us what you're really capable of because Crank happened ""just the way you planned it""...You'd think they earn themselves a royalty of some amount every time they mention the film Crank in the GAMER inteviews!
