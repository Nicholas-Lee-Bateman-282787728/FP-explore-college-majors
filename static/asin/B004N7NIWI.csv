1420715,A1KONL8ECYFG37,B004N7NIWI,DVD Verdict,"[3, 12]","Judge Tom Becker, DVD Verdict-- The Secret Life: Jeffrey Dahmer was released in 1993, a year after Dahmer had been convicted of 15 murders and sentenced to 957 years in prison. While the film opens with a text crawl about the case and features a running narration by the title character, it offers no insight beyond what you could have found in the newspaper accounts of the day, and less than you'd find currently on the Internet. What it offers instead is a steady stream of grindhouse-worthy killings and simplistic psychological musings supposedly from the Monster of Milwaukee himself. There's no social context and no outside voice; this is basically a slasher/exploitation film based--almost too closely, at times--on real events.The film was shot on an extremely low budget. Normally, that wouldn't matter much, but in the case of The Secret Life, it has a terribly disconcerting effect. The Secret Life: Jeffrey Dahmer looks like an exploitation film from the '70s. It also plays like an exploitation film from the '70s, with cheesy performances, stilted dialogue, all that.Only it's not an exploitation film from the '70s, it's a ""true crime film"" that was produced while the Dahmer wounds were still fresh. While there's a whiff of sincerity about the whole thing that should distinguish it from a ""fact-based"" grinder like 1971's The Zodiac Killer, it's ultimately so simple-minded and grisly that it works as a horror movie and little else. It recounts the story for maximum shock value, but since there's little here beyond a parade of young men being drugged and sacrificed, it's all rather tedious--not to mention revolting.The disc is a fairly unexciting affair: full frame transfer, stereo sound, and a commentary with Crew and director David R. Bowen. You'd think that since Dahmer was killed in prison in 1994, someone might have updated the closing text, which states, ""Dahmer is currently serving 15 consecutive life terms,"" but apparently, no one got around to that.-Full review at dvdverdict.com",1,Disturbing in a number of ways--not all of them intentional,1310688000,"07 15, 2011",2011,2019,"['Judge', 'Tom', 'Becker', 'DVD', 'Verdict', 'Secret', 'Life', 'Jeffrey', 'Dahmer', 'was', 'released', '1993', 'year', 'Dahmer', 'had', 'been', 'convicted', '15', 'murders', 'sentenced', '957', 'years', 'prison', 'film', 'text', 'crawl', 'case', 'running', 'narration', 'title', 'character', 'insight', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'found', 'newspaper', 'accounts', 'day', 'less', ""'d"", 'find', 'currently', 'Internet', 'What', 'instead', 'steady', 'stream', 'grindhouse-worthy', 'killings', 'simplistic', 'psychological', 'musings', 'supposedly', 'Monster', 'Milwaukee', 'social', 'context', 'outside', 'voice', 'basically', 'slasher/exploitation', 'film', 'based', 'almost', 'too', 'closely', 'times', 'real', 'events.The', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'extremely', 'low', 'budget', 'Normally', 'would', ""n't"", 'matter', 'much', 'case', 'Secret', 'Life', 'terribly', 'disconcerting', 'effect', 'Secret', 'Life', 'Jeffrey', 'Dahmer', 'exploitation', 'film', ""'70s"", 'also', 'exploitation', 'film', ""'70s"", 'cheesy', 'performances', 'stilted', 'dialogue', 'that.Only', 'not', 'exploitation', 'film', ""'70s"", 'true', 'crime', 'film', 'was', 'produced', 'Dahmer', 'wounds', 'were', 'still', 'fresh', 'whiff', 'sincerity', 'whole', 'thing', 'should', 'distinguish', 'fact-based', 'grinder', '1971', 'Zodiac', 'Killer', 'ultimately', 'so', 'simple-minded', 'grisly', 'horror', 'movie', 'little', 'else', 'story', 'maximum', 'shock', 'value', 'little', 'here', 'parade', 'young', 'men', 'being', 'drugged', 'sacrificed', 'rather', 'tedious', 'not', 'mention', 'revolting.The', 'disc', 'fairly', 'unexciting', 'affair', 'full', 'frame', 'transfer', 'stereo', 'sound', 'commentary', 'Crew', 'director', 'David', 'R.', 'Bowen', ""'d"", 'think', 'Dahmer', 'was', 'killed', 'prison', '1994', 'someone', 'might', 'have', 'updated', 'closing', 'text', 'Dahmer', 'currently', 'serving', '15', 'consecutive', 'life', 'terms', 'apparently', 'one', 'got', 'that.-Full', 'review', 'dvdverdict.com']",N/A

Carl did a excellent job playing Dahmer especially his looks. Secret Life of Jeffrey Dahmer is a movie base on Dahmer's killings and life, after watching this movie I felted sorry for the victims. But I can't helped feeling a little sorry for Jeffrey being abandon by both parents and then his grandmother. The movie did have gore, not a lot, but enough and the music helped the movie as well.

However, out of all the Dahmer based films I have seen so far, this one is the best. It delves into more of what Dahmer did to his victims (though certain scenarios and names were changed). However, after a while, though still disturbing, the murders get a little boring. I hate to say this, but so many men being poisoned and murdered, you start to phase it out. However, dispite the previous sentence, the acts remain disgusting, and disturbing. The acting fluxuates...sometimes good, sometimes passable. The man who played Dahmer, kept his performance going, though some of the other actors couldn't pass as believable characters.Also, this film has a campy feel to it.
