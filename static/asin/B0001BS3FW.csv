799416,A358XP3X4U0X45,B0001BS3FW,bookloversfriend,"[7, 13]","This is one of those infuriating movies: most of it is splendid--five stars (the parts involving the horse and the girl who learns to ride).  The rest stinks--one star (the ""love"" story).There's nothing wrong with putting a love story into a movie like this.  It could have made the movie better.  But you don't put in any love story into any script in which one of the characters is repulsive.  Any script consultant could have told the producer that.  (And every screenwriter of any worth should know it.)  The screenwriter did everything she could think of to make this guy obnoxious and she succeeded.  Is she serious?  Would you advise any friend of yours to marry a creep like this?  I kept thinking that it was going to be alright because she was eventually going to tell him to take a hike, so when--with no understable motivation--she gave herself to him sexually, it was revolting (and I like a good love scene).  If we believed such an outrageous turn of events, we would have to say that this girl has serious psychological problems (even though there is no other evidence of such problems).  In the end, we can only hope that she wises up during her coming year and finds a man worthy of her.And we can hope that other producers and screenwriters learn from this huge mistake and write only love stories in which both characters are lovable.",3,why producers hire script consultants,1129161600,"10 13, 2005",2005,1354,"['one', 'infuriating', 'movies', 'most', 'splendid', 'five', 'stars', 'parts', 'involving', 'horse', 'girl', 'who', 'ride', 'rest', 'stinks', 'one', 'star', 'love', 'story', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'putting', 'love', 'story', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'movie', 'better', 'do', ""n't"", 'put', 'love', 'story', 'script', 'one', 'characters', 'repulsive', 'script', 'consultant', 'could', 'have', 'told', 'producer', 'screenwriter', 'worth', 'should', 'know', 'screenwriter', 'did', 'everything', 'could', 'think', 'make', 'guy', 'obnoxious', 'succeeded', 'serious', 'Would', 'advise', 'friend', 'yours', 'marry', 'creep', 'kept', 'thinking', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'alright', 'was', 'eventually', 'going', 'tell', 'take', 'hike', 'so', 'when', 'understable', 'motivation', 'gave', 'sexually', 'was', 'revolting', 'like', 'good', 'love', 'scene', 'believed', 'such', 'outrageous', 'turn', 'events', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'girl', 'serious', 'psychological', 'problems', 'even', 'other', 'evidence', 'such', 'problems', 'end', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'up', 'coming', 'year', 'man', 'worthy', 'her.And', 'can', 'hope', 'other', 'producers', 'screenwriters', 'learn', 'huge', 'mistake', 'write', 'only', 'love', 'stories', 'characters', 'are', 'lovable']",N/A

To get it on DVD will be much better, though. I have enjoyed Richard Farnsworth in a Kenny Rogers movie called Wild Horses, and in The Straight Story. He was also on an episode of Highway to Heaven. I watched Charlie take care of her younger brothers, fighting with CPS to keep her family together, then fighting with Mr. Foster to let her and her brothers move in with him. Watching her ride Sylvester topped everything, though, especially that sailing jump over the pickup that encouraged her to train him for, of all things, a championship three-day event. As improbable as it is for a first-timer to win, this is a movie, not a documentary. I enjoyed watching the man lead the contestants over the cross-country course so they would know what they were facing. Another moment earlier on I look forward to is watching Charlie try on the jodphurs and being told she had better wear white undies. So much she had to learn, such as how to salute to begin her dressage routine, and that it was an event, not a horse show. A terrific movie showing the viewers that, with support and encouragement, and your own determination, you just might end up a winner.",5,Improbable But Wonderful,1235347200,"02 23, 2009",2009,1235,"['What', 'astonishing', 'movie', 'was', 'am', 'glad', 'taped', 'off', 'television', 'get', 'DVD', 'will', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'Richard', 'Farnsworth', 'Kenny', 'Rogers', 'movie', 'called', 'Wild', 'Horses', 'Straight', 'Story', 'was', 'also', 'episode', 'Highway', 'Heaven', 'watched', 'Charlie', 'take', 'care', 'younger', 'brothers', 'fighting', 'CPS', 'keep', 'family', 'together', 'then', 'fighting', 'Mr.', 'Foster', 'let', 'brothers', 'move', 'Watching', 'ride', 'Sylvester', 'topped', 'everything', 'though', 'especially', 'sailing', 'jump', 'pickup', 'encouraged', 'train', 'things', 'championship', 'three-day', 'event', 'As', 'improbable', 'first-timer', 'win', 'movie', 'not', 'documentary', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'man', 'lead', 'contestants', 'cross-country', 'course', 'would', 'know', 'what', 'were', 'facing', 'moment', 'earlier', 'look', 'forward', 'watching', 'Charlie', 'try', 'jodphurs', 'being', 'told', 'had', 'better', 'wear', 'white', 'undies', 'So', 'much', 'had', 'learn', 'such', 'how', 'salute', 'begin', 'dressage', 'routine', 'was', 'event', 'not', 'horse', 'show', 'terrific', 'movie', 'showing', 'viewers', 'support', 'encouragement', 'own', 'determination', 'just', 'might', 'end', 'up', 'winner']",N/A

Gilbert is a tough on the outside / soft on the inside teenage orphan who trains a worthless cowpony, transforming him into a classy 3-Day Eventer. With the help of her drunken mentor (Richard Farnsworth, the penultimate cowboy) they train the ghostly gray horse by moonlight, and dazzle everyone by daylight when the horse and his rider make it to the top show ranks. There are lots of sudsy subplots, but it just adds to the fun. I loved this movie the first time I saw it, and my horsy friends and I all saw it more than once.
