1523104,A12VND3BWSF3PL,B006ZL1P34,Humphrey Dao,"[31, 31]","The main draw for this release by Echo Bridge Home Entertainment is to have the fourth through seventh Pokemon movies all on one disc in 16:9 widescreen and 1080p high definition. At any time watching the films, you can press the ""pop up/menu"" button on your blu-ray remote and switch to another film pretty quickly. It's quite convenient to have these four movies on one disc since it saves shelf space and you don't have to change between discs every time. I should mention that with this release, you know for certain you're getting the widescreen versions of Movies 4-7. It's a bit unclear which of the many DVD releases that Echo Bridge has put out of the Pokemon movies are in 16:9 widescreen and which are just repackaged releases of the original full screen Miramax DVDs. It's also a bargain, especially if you wait awhile for the price to drop to a really cheap price on Amazon as it's bound to do in the future (I got my copy from another online vendor for around $10).The bad thing about this release is that image quality can vary from film to film--but especially with Pokemon 4ever and Pokemon Heroes.  The sound for all four movies is adequate but disappointing for blu-ray. It states on the back that Pokemon Heroes and Destiny Deoxys have English 2.0 Stereo, while Pokemon 4ever and Jirachi have English 5.1 DTS. There are no subtitles available. In addition, it only has the English 4kids dub and not the original Japanese audio.The main menu has a nice image of the giant Groudon from Movie 6 on the left of screen and the Deoxys from Movie 7 on the right. In between are the four movie title logos listed down in order of release. When you select any one of the movies, it takes you to another menu page where you have the option to play the film, select chapters, or return to the main menu. There are absolutely no bonus features included.Now, on to the image quality. Pokemon 4ever is a little disappointing. Some scenes are shaky, unstable, and have some slight grain (especially the opening and closing credit sequences). It really doesn't seem all that different from an up-scaled DVD. Colors tend to be on the murky side and the image is a bit soft, but it's nothing overly distracting and the image overall is bright and easy to watch...which is more than I can say for Pokemon Heroes. Movie 5 still has that dark blueish tint that was on the original 2004Pokemon Heroes: The MovieMiramax DVD and on the double feature blu-rayPokemon Heroes / Pokemon: Destiny Deoxys (Double Feature) [Blu-ray] Echo Bridge released last year, except Pokemon Heroes seems somehow even worse here. Night scenes--and even some daytime scenes--have an annoying neon ""glowing"" quality that's so distracting. The 2004 Miramax DVD also had this problem, but at least the image was brighter. If you have this original DVD, I wouldn't recommend getting rid of it.The image quality for Jirachi and Destiny Deoxys, on the other hand, are surprisingly good by comparison. Colors are bright and lines are sharp. They definitely feel more like blu-ray quality than the previous two films. In fact, this is probably the best you'll ever get for Movies 6 and 7 and a definite upgrade from the DVDs.****Edited to add: This blu-ray does not have the Pokemon shorts that were included on the original Miramax DVDs of Pokemon 4ever, Heroes, and Jirachi Wishmaker. (Destiny Deoxys never had a short when it originally premiered in Japan, which explains why at 98 minutes it's the longest of the four movies.)****",3,Four Pokemon movies on 1 blu-ray disc,1334793600,"04 19, 2012",2012,3502,"['main', 'draw', 'release', 'Echo', 'Bridge', 'Home', 'Entertainment', 'have', 'fourth', 'seventh', 'Pokemon', 'movies', 'one', 'disc', '16:9', 'widescreen', '1080p', 'high', 'definition', 'time', 'watching', 'films', 'can', 'press', 'pop', 'up/menu', 'button', 'blu-ray', 'remote', 'switch', 'film', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'quite', 'convenient', 'have', 'four', 'movies', 'one', 'disc', 'space', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'change', 'discs', 'time', 'should', 'mention', 'release', 'know', 'certain', ""'re"", 'getting', 'widescreen', 'versions', 'Movies', '4-7', 'bit', 'unclear', 'many', 'DVD', 'Echo', 'Bridge', 'put', 'Pokemon', 'movies', 'are', '16:9', 'widescreen', 'are', 'just', 'repackaged', 'releases', 'original', 'full', 'screen', 'Miramax', 'DVDs', 'also', 'bargain', 'especially', 'wait', 'awhile', 'price', 'drop', 'really', 'cheap', 'price', 'Amazon', 'bound', 'do', 'future', 'got', 'copy', 'online', 'vendor', '10', '.The', 'bad', 'thing', 'release', 'image', 'quality', 'can', 'vary', 'film', 'film', 'especially', 'Pokemon', '4ever', 'Pokemon', 'Heroes', 'sound', 'four', 'movies', 'adequate', 'disappointing', 'blu-ray', 'back', 'Pokemon', 'Heroes', 'Destiny', 'Deoxys', 'have', 'English', '2.0', 'Stereo', 'Pokemon', '4ever', 'Jirachi', 'have', 'English', '5.1', 'DTS', 'are', 'subtitles', 'available', 'addition', 'only', 'English', '4kids', 'dub', 'not', 'original', 'Japanese', 'audio.The', 'main', 'menu', 'nice', 'image', 'giant', 'Groudon', 'Movie', '6', 'left', 'screen', 'Deoxys', 'Movie', '7', 'right', 'are', 'four', 'movie', 'title', 'logos', 'listed', 'down', 'order', 'release', 'When', 'select', 'one', 'movies', 'menu', 'page', 'where', 'have', 'option', 'play', 'film', 'select', 'chapters', 'return', 'main', 'menu', 'are', 'absolutely', 'bonus', 'included.Now', 'image', 'quality', 'Pokemon', '4ever', 'little', 'disappointing', 'scenes', 'are', 'shaky', 'unstable', 'have', 'slight', 'grain', 'especially', 'opening', 'closing', 'credit', 'sequences', 'really', ""n't"", 'seem', 'different', 'up-scaled', 'DVD', 'Colors', 'tend', 'be', 'murky', 'side', 'image', 'bit', 'soft', 'nothing', 'overly', 'distracting', 'image', 'overall', 'bright', 'easy', 'watch', 'more', 'can', 'say', 'Pokemon', 'Heroes', 'Movie', '5', 'still', 'dark', 'blueish', 'tint', 'was', 'original', '2004Pokemon', 'Heroes', 'MovieMiramax', 'DVD', 'double', 'feature', 'blu-rayPokemon', 'Heroes', '/', 'Pokemon', 'Destiny', 'Deoxys', 'Double', 'Feature', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'Echo', 'Bridge', 'released', 'last', 'year', 'Pokemon', 'Heroes', 'somehow', 'even', 'worse', 'here', 'Night', 'scenes', 'even', 'daytime', 'scenes', 'have', 'annoying', 'neon', 'glowing', 'quality', 'so', 'distracting', '2004', 'Miramax', 'DVD', 'also', 'had', 'problem', 'least', 'image', 'was', 'brighter', 'have', 'original', 'DVD', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'getting', 'rid', 'it.The', 'image', 'quality', 'Jirachi', 'Destiny', 'Deoxys', 'other', 'hand', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'comparison', 'Colors', 'are', 'bright', 'lines', 'are', 'sharp', 'definitely', 'feel', 'more', 'blu-ray', 'quality', 'previous', 'two', 'films', 'fact', 'probably', 'best', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'get', 'Movies', '6', '7', 'definite', 'upgrade', 'DVDs', '****Edited', 'add', 'blu-ray', 'not', 'have', 'Pokemon', 'shorts', 'were', 'included', 'original', 'Miramax', 'DVDs', 'Pokemon', '4ever', 'Heroes', 'Jirachi', 'Wishmaker', 'Destiny', 'Deoxys', 'never', 'had', 'short', 'when', 'originally', 'premiered', 'Japan', 'why', '98', 'minutes', 'longest', 'four', 'movies', '****']",Pokemon 4 Film Series
