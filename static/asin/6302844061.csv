They mix plutonium and uranium oxide to create pellets for nuclear power. Is it safe? Karen Silkwood's personality is shown. [No ban on smoking.] Karen visits her children, she doesn't have custody. There is a long drive home. [No seatbelts. Symbolism?] What caused that contamination? Drew hopes to start an auto mechanic business. Life and work goes on. They are behind schedule on their work. Then the radiation alarm goes off! [The film moves slowly, as if to lull the viewers before surprising action.] Why would the negatives be retouched?Karen volunteers to work for their union. Is she diplomatic? Does she have the moral strength? Does Kerr-McGee own the state? Karen tells about the retouched negatives. Will this create problems? Drew quit and moved out. Karen is caught snooping, but she explains it. Plutonium causes cancer. Is there any acceptable level? Only the union can stand up for the workers. Why did Dolly's friend lose that key? [The film moves slowly.] Karen records and reports some events. Is this dangerous? Drew returns. Karen sets off the radiation alarm. Her house is contaminated. Did someone spike her sample? They clean out her house, removing the wallpaper and furniture. She learns about her medical status. Karen plans to meet a reporter, but she had an accident on the road. The next year the plant was shut down. [Was it located in the wrong area?]The film does not answer the reason for Karen's death. Was she sleepy at the wheel? Did another car push her off the road? What did the condition of her car say? The ending is unsatisfactory. In real life Gerry Spence sued the corporation on behalf of Karen's children, and won. Its in his book. Spence compared plutonium to a dangerous animal whose release makes the owner liable, no matter what. [Was that a fair comparison?]This film vaguely suggests that nuclear power is the villain, a form of propaganda for special interests.

340735,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6302844061,Andrew Ellington,"[4, 4]","When you take a legendary film director like Mike Nichols and pair him with the legend herself, Meryl Streep, you get one of the most underrated gems of 80's cinema; `Silkwood'.You could sit there and label it with a slew of faults it you wanted to (the film is strategically clich&eacute;d and appears dated in the way that only 80's film have a way of feeling dated, and it certainly borrows a lot of plot points from `Norma Rae' despite difference in the film's core) but at the end of the day, there are little in `Silkwood' that won't catch your eye and draw you in.  For the type of film that this is (biopic highlighting the mysterious death and controversial work of a determined woman), `Silkwood' gets just about everything right.The film centers on Karen Silkwood, a wild woman working at a nuclear plant in Oklahoma.  Despite the apparent hardships she'll face due to her course, Karen throws caution to the wind in her determination to help protect the lives of her co-workers; working hard to expose the negligence of her company and the risk that she and her friends are being put in.Ultimately, it cost her.If you took `Norma Rae' and fused it with `Gorilla's in the Mist' you'd have `Silkwood', a film that is better in structure, tone and everything in between (and I'm a huge fan of `Norma Rae').One thing that makes `Silkwood' linger is the brilliant performances by the entire cast, but most notable the three main stars, Streep, Russell and Cher.  Meryl Streep is a goddess of cinema, and what she does with Karen Silkwood is nothing short of genius.  Complete with a mullet and an accent, I don't know if I've ever found Meryl more beautiful and enticing as she was here.  Her spirit pervades every scene, and as she delves into the darkness of her course you can see it erode her to the point where she is a victim of her own determinations.  Kurt Russell was the nicest surprise, beings that I rarely find him remotely `good' in his films.  He really delivered a flawless performance, the perfect supporting role; quiet yet assertive at all the key moments.  He uses his charm, yet this time with a purpose, never forgetting to show his characters human side.  His doting over Karen is clear in his eyes and his distain for her newfound passion leaks across his handsome face.  And then there is Cher in what may be her best role.  Perfectly deglamed (she looks awful), Cher punctuates each moment with beautiful restraint.  Her facial expressions, especially in her final frames, say so much.I applaud you Nichols for dragging the best out of these actors.",5,Penetrates and remains...,1299542400,"03 8, 2011",2011,2582,"['When', 'take', 'legendary', 'film', 'director', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'pair', 'legend', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'get', 'one', 'most', 'underrated', 'gems', '80', 'cinema', ""Silkwood'.You"", 'could', 'sit', 'label', 'slew', 'faults', 'wanted', 'film', 'strategically', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'dated', 'way', 'only', '80', 'film', 'have', 'way', 'feeling', 'dated', 'certainly', 'lot', 'plot', 'points', 'Norma', 'Rae', 'difference', 'film', 'core', 'end', 'day', 'are', 'little', 'Silkwood', 'wo', ""n't"", 'catch', 'eye', 'draw', 'type', 'film', 'highlighting', 'mysterious', 'death', 'controversial', 'work', 'determined', 'woman', 'Silkwood', 'just', 'everything', 'right.The', 'film', 'centers', 'Karen', 'Silkwood', 'wild', 'woman', 'working', 'nuclear', 'plant', 'Oklahoma', 'apparent', ""'ll"", 'face', 'due', 'course', 'Karen', 'caution', 'wind', 'determination', 'help', 'protect', 'lives', 'co-workers', 'working', 'hard', 'expose', 'negligence', 'company', 'risk', 'friends', 'are', 'being', 'put', 'in.Ultimately', 'cost', 'her.If', 'took', 'Norma', 'Rae', 'fused', 'Gorilla', 'Mist', ""'d"", 'have', 'Silkwood', 'film', 'better', 'structure', 'tone', 'everything', ""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'Norma', 'Rae', '.One', 'thing', 'Silkwood', 'linger', 'brilliant', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'most', 'notable', 'three', 'main', 'stars', 'Streep', 'Russell', 'Cher', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'goddess', 'cinema', 'what', 'Karen', 'Silkwood', 'nothing', 'short', 'genius', 'Complete', 'mullet', 'accent', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'found', 'Meryl', 'more', 'beautiful', 'enticing', 'was', 'here', 'spirit', 'pervades', 'scene', 'darkness', 'course', 'can', 'see', 'erode', 'point', 'where', 'victim', 'own', 'determinations', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'was', 'nicest', 'surprise', 'beings', 'rarely', 'find', 'remotely', 'good', 'films', 'really', 'delivered', 'flawless', 'performance', 'perfect', 'supporting', 'role', 'quiet', 'yet', 'assertive', 'key', 'moments', 'charm', 'yet', 'time', 'purpose', 'never', 'forgetting', 'show', 'characters', 'human', 'side', 'doting', 'Karen', 'clear', 'eyes', 'distain', 'newfound', 'passion', 'leaks', 'handsome', 'face', 'then', 'Cher', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'role', 'Perfectly', 'deglamed', 'awful', 'Cher', 'moment', 'beautiful', 'restraint', 'facial', 'expressions', 'especially', 'final', 'frames', 'say', 'so', 'much.I', 'applaud', 'Nichols', 'dragging', 'best', 'actors']",N/A

All I see is walking around, chain-smoking, and a lot of boring conversations. Finally, the film gets to the bottom of the plot. It's not bad, but I knew what she was getting into. So, I can't say the ending was tragic. Then again, she wasn't too bright, given how unbalanced her life was. However, I think she should have gone to a lawyer for protection. The greatest irony of them all, as Karen seemed to be worried getting cancer from plutonium, she still chain-smoked like there is no tomorrow. Then again, you just can't fight stupid. Although Cher is nominated for her role, I disagree vehemently about that because she is basically inconsequential. Instead, it should have gone to Kurt Russell in what is a very underrated performance. When his character was gone for some while after breaking up with Karen, his presence was greatly missed. Regardless, the whole cast, an all-star one, is incredible, and they all blend in very well, playing the common townsfolk.

At the beginning of the film Karen seems to be an ordinary worker with no tendencies towards activism or political radicalism.

Her death, in a single car accident attributed to ""falling asleep at the wheel,"" was suspect because she just happened to be on her way to meet a ""New York Times"" reporter to expose the Cimmaron Fuels Plant for numerous safety violations. Though her death was never officially solved, Kerr-McGee finally settled with Ms. Silkwood's family for $1.4 million without admitting liabilty. Opinions vary as to Ms. Silkwood's character as either a Martyr or White Trash. That being said, this film tends to swirl around innuendo and jumbled conclusions. Mike Nichols is a first-rate Director and Nora Ephron a Class A Writer but they are awash in inaccuracies. Though the story takes place on the high Plains of Oklahoma, it was filmed in a studio in Texas and you never quite get the feel of a small Oklahoma town. The lesbian storyline (with an uglied-up Cher) is superflous, although it is interesting to see what Cher looked like before her grotesque plastic surgeries. Meryl Streep chain smokes, chews wads of gum, and inhales beer as Karen Silkwood, but her performance is oddly benign: careful not to play a victim, Ms. Streep also leaves reasonable doubt as to whether Karen Silkwood contaminated herself to make Kerr-McGee look bad. Her rendition of ""Amazing Grace,"" both early and late in the film, showcases her eye on Oscar, and is manipulative.Though she has the perfect Oklahoma accent, Ms. Streep frankly looks too old to play a mid-20's heroine.

A film centered on a spunky blue collar heroine that winds up casting Cher in a secondary role and NOT as the title character!!! Where's the justice in that?  If you look at pictures of the actual Karen Silkwood, she even looks like Cher.  Or at least a heck of a lot more like Cher than Meryl Streep.Still, Meryl eventually won me over.  Heck, she always does.  I don't think I've ever seen any actress inhabit her roles more than she.  She sinks her proverbial teeth into the role of a sassy but reluctant whistle blower and ultimately becomes so convincing that by the time her character actually breaks down and uses a multi-syllable phrase like ""moral imperative,""  you have to marvel at how much her union work and whistle blowing activities have increased her vocabulary.  She's that convincing: this is Karen talking, not Yale educated Meryl.I have a thing for socially conscious movies from the 70s and early 80s, especially ones with spunky but uneducated working class heroines, whose gradual awakening to the social injustices they previously preferred to ignore.  Movies like this one NORMA RAE, as well THE CHINA SYNDROME were made in an emerging socially and politically aware climate, which is why the heroines of same must almost invariably undergo a political awakening (sometimes combined with a sexual one, although that's less the case here).  The politics of SILKWOOD are garden variety liberal doctrines made pictorial.  It's well worth seeing of course, for its brave subject matter and sterling performances.  I would agree with those who maintain that Cher and Kurt Russell have rarely been better.  And Streep is a marvel, although that can scarcely be news.If the film has any significant flaw, it's that it often has something of a sketchy quality--which is not all that uncommon  with film bio's.  Below you'll find that others have argued that very point.  Can any two-hour film bio actually capture its subject's essence?  SILKWOOD suggests that it is possible to provide glimpses of that essence.

Most Americans probably support an assassination or two on the basis of national interest.So if it's OK to kill someone inconvienient if you work for the government, why is it not OK for Kerr-McGee? Suppose Kerr-McGee had had one of its government allies do the wet work. Would that have made it OK?Some of this may be changing in movieland.

The acting and directing were largely outstanding (with one exception I'll get to).  Meryl Streep has always impressed me with the subtle way she uses her talent.  Her charactors generally don't scream, sob, or rally the troops yet her presence is quietly powerful.  Kurt Russell's charactor plays well along side Streep's Silkwood.  The director, Mike Nichols, does an excellent job of letting us get to know the characters and their community though a good range of seemingly casual scenes.  He may overdo the ""dumb reckneck"" a bit but I've seen other directors do far worse in that regard.  He allows the movie to move along slowly yet purposely.  Some may argue that it goes too slowly at times but we, generally, remain emgrossed in the plot.The movie is part suspense and part political and we are clearly led toward a conclusion.  This is not a documentary so I should not care that we are directed toward one conclusion.  It may be the right one, after all, but the truth could be far more innocuous than we are led to believe.  There are a lot of things that MIGHT be true but not much that we can be certain of.  In many ways, that is part of the excellence of ""Silkwood"".  Too many other directors are far more blunt about their causes than Nichols is in this movie.One final note about ""Silkwood"" and one that I'd prefer not to make but it's one I just can't overlook.  Cher, in what I think was her second movie, was nominated for a Best Supporting Oscar.  I knew this before the movie began so I was somewhat focussed on her character.  There was never so much as one scene that led me to understand why she was nominated.  If anything, her character seemed to be totally extraneous and insignificant to the plot.  At times, it was actually embarassing to watch her deliver her limited lines.  The nomination made no sense to me.  I have seen her in other movies and I know that she can act but she was in basic training in ""Silkwood""",4,Conspiracy Theory,1171670400,"02 17, 2007",2007,2072,"['saw', 'Silkwood', 'first', 'time', 'last', 'night', 'came', 'away', 'thinking', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'few', 'faults', 'acting', 'directing', 'were', 'largely', 'outstanding', 'one', 'exception', ""'ll"", 'get', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'always', 'impressed', 'subtle', 'way', 'talent', 'charactors', 'generally', 'do', ""n't"", 'scream', 'sob', 'rally', 'troops', 'yet', 'presence', 'quietly', 'powerful', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'charactor', 'well', 'along', 'side', 'Streep', 'Silkwood', 'director', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'excellent', 'job', 'letting', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'community', 'good', 'range', 'seemingly', 'casual', 'scenes', 'may', 'overdo', 'dumb', 'reckneck', 'bit', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'directors', 'do', 'far', 'worse', 'regard', 'movie', 'move', 'along', 'slowly', 'yet', 'purposely', 'may', 'argue', 'too', 'slowly', 'times', 'generally', 'remain', 'emgrossed', 'plot.The', 'movie', 'part', 'suspense', 'part', 'political', 'are', 'clearly', 'led', 'conclusion', 'not', 'documentary', 'should', 'not', 'care', 'are', 'directed', 'one', 'conclusion', 'may', 'be', 'right', 'one', 'truth', 'could', 'be', 'far', 'more', 'innocuous', 'are', 'led', 'believe', 'are', 'lot', 'things', 'MIGHT', 'be', 'true', 'not', 'much', 'can', 'be', 'certain', 'many', 'ways', 'part', 'excellence', 'Silkwood', 'Too', 'many', 'other', 'directors', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'blunt', 'causes', 'Nichols', 'movie.One', 'final', 'note', 'Silkwood', 'one', ""'d"", 'prefer', 'not', 'make', 'one', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'overlook', 'Cher', 'what', 'think', 'was', 'second', 'movie', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Oscar', 'knew', 'movie', 'began', 'so', 'was', 'somewhat', 'focussed', 'character', 'was', 'never', 'so', 'much', 'one', 'scene', 'led', 'understand', 'why', 'was', 'nominated', 'anything', 'character', 'seemed', 'be', 'totally', 'extraneous', 'insignificant', 'plot', 'times', 'was', 'actually', 'embarassing', 'watch', 'deliver', 'limited', 'lines', 'nomination', 'made', 'sense', 'have', 'seen', 'other', 'movies', 'know', 'can', 'act', 'was', 'basic', 'training', 'Silkwood']",N/A
340766,A2HRVVDJMY5M4Z,6302844061,R. Graff,"[3, 3]","This is a movie that will always be best remembered as Cher's true acting debut, as well as one of the many superior performances given by Meryl Streep.  It tells the story of a woman who works at a nuclear power plant with her boyfriend and lesbian friend, and who's day on the job is seemingly routine and uninteresting.  That is, until the day she becomes contaminated by plutonium, and then she begins to piece together that things in the plant are not run as safely as they could and should be.On the plus side, all of the performances are good.  Streep is incredibly convincing as always in her role as a working class plant worker, Cher is almost unrecognizable and unglamorous as a gay woman living a very uninteresting life.  Kurt Russell also does a good job as Streep's live-in lover who is drifting apart from her.  Furthermore, the atmosphere is perfectly suited for the story, and all the characters are easy to relate to in their own ways.  Another good thing about this film is that it is about regular people just trying to make it through life, which is pretty refreshing.However, this movie is not exactly perfect.  First off, the pacing is very slow, which is beneficial at times and detrimental at others.  In other words, there are times when the movie drags.  Secondly, the supporting characters can sometimes be more distracting than complementing.  Finally, while the movie is very realistic, realism is not always entertaining, so sometimes you may the movie a bit boring.I first saw Silkwood when I was in high school, and I disliked it.  Now that I am older, I liked it significantly better, so younger people with short attention spans may not enjoy this film.  Also, I do feel that there are similar movies, such as North Country and Erin Brockovich, that do the subjects in this movie (being poisoned, unhealthy work environment) better.

Kurt Russell and of course, Meryl Streep, are fantastic, very high caliber performances. The setting, the plant and the other workers, all lend an air of depression and danger, the plant is a place no one in their right mind would ever want to work, no matter how high the salary. As Drew (Russell) explains to Karen (Streep) those aren't Post Toasties you're workin' with...&quot; underlining the extreme danger of working with these substances. When they go to see Karen's children, living with their father and his new wife, it is SO depressing I could hardly watch; I cannot imagine living in such a place and under such conditions...I once went to a place in California called the City of Industry, and it reminded me of that. A real nightmare of industry, right in your front, back and side yards. The workers try hard to have an air of normality, but really, under such hazardous conditions, it is not possible. The gradual, increasing deliberate contamination of Silkwood is so vile, so insidious and so tragic, it is horrifying...better to shoot someone to death, than that prolonged agony and horror she must have endured before they finally succeeded in killing her. Streep's singing, a capella, of &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; over the end credits is heartbreaking, and she does a great job with it...it is an evocative song to begin with; under these circumstances it is dreadfully sad to hear. It is a true nightmare journey into a world where people earn a living exposing themselves to contamination every day, and those who work in nuclear plants, I take my hat off to you...you are truly brave souls.

She never got there.""Thus, what this movie does is attempt to piece together the life of Karen Gay Silkwood (born: 1946) up to the time of the tragedy that took her life in Nov. 1974.This movie is essentially the true story about Karen Silkwood's (Meryl Streep) struggle against a huge nuclear corporation.In the movie, Silkwood lives a free-spirited life with two friends, Drew (Kurt Russell) and Dolly (Cher), who work with her at a nuclear facility that handles plutonium.  It's only when she discovers that she's been exposed to nuclear radiation that she begins investigating for evidence of wrongdoing at her company.  Her sudden zest for safer working conditions comes at a high price as she alienates not only her friends who want to keep their jobs at the facility (despite the risk to themselves) but the facility itself whose profits may be interrupted by her nosiness.This movie does an excellent job of portraying Silkwood's life and the circumstances that led up to the 1974 tragedy.  As well, artistically everything about the movie is well done garnering this movie five Academy Award nominations at the time.  These were Best Actress (Streep), Best Supporting Actress (Cher), Best Director (Mike Nichols), Best Original Screenplay, and Best Editing.  (I'm not sure why Kurt Russell was not nominated.  He gives a standout performance.)Streep's singing of ""Amazing Grace"" at the end of the movie as kind of a ""song-over"" (that's like a voice-over) is very effective and touched my emotions.The only problem I had with this movie is that it assumed that viewers knew about things nuclear.  For example, Silkwood discovers that an employee (played very effectively by Craig T. Nelson of ""Coach"" fame) is altering the X-ray photographs of fuel rods.  What's a fuel rod?  Why is it essential that they have no imperfections?  Later we're told that these fuel rods will be used in ""breeder reactors.""  What's a breeder reactor and why is it so special?  (I know about things nuclear thus making the story very suspenseful and chilling to me but to expect all viewers to know about such things, I think, was unfair).  Note that it's not essential to understand all things nuclear but knowing such stuff will enhance your enjoyment of the movie.Finally, the DVD has only one real extra.  This is the original theatrical trailer to this movie.In conclusion, this is a fascinating movie that tells us the story of an unlikely heroine!!(1983;  2 hr 10 min;  widescreen;  24 scenes;  closed-captioned)+++++",4,Corporate Profits versus Worker Safety,1118620800,"06 13, 2005",2005,2806,"['+++++', 'Note', 'review', 'movie', 'released', 'Metro', 'Goldwyn-Mayer', 'Oct.', '2003', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'movie', 'Nov.', '13', '1974', 'Karen', 'Silkwood', 'employee', 'Oklahoma', 'nuclear', 'facility', 'was', 'way', 'meet', 'reporter', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'never', 'got', 'there', 'Thus', 'what', 'movie', 'attempt', 'piece', 'together', 'life', 'Karen', 'Gay', 'Silkwood', 'born', '1946', 'time', 'tragedy', 'took', 'life', 'Nov.', '1974.This', 'movie', 'essentially', 'true', 'story', 'Karen', 'Silkwood', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'struggle', 'huge', 'nuclear', 'corporation.In', 'movie', 'Silkwood', 'free-spirited', 'life', 'two', 'friends', 'Drew', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'Dolly', 'Cher', 'who', 'work', 'nuclear', 'facility', 'plutonium', 'only', 'when', 'been', 'exposed', 'nuclear', 'radiation', 'investigating', 'evidence', 'wrongdoing', 'company', 'sudden', 'zest', 'safer', 'working', 'conditions', 'high', 'price', 'not', 'only', 'friends', 'who', 'want', 'keep', 'jobs', 'facility', 'risk', 'facility', 'profits', 'may', 'be', 'interrupted', 'nosiness.This', 'movie', 'excellent', 'job', 'portraying', 'Silkwood', 'life', 'circumstances', 'led', 'up', '1974', 'tragedy', 'As', 'well', 'artistically', 'everything', 'movie', 'well', 'done', 'garnering', 'movie', 'five', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nominations', 'time', 'were', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Streep', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'Cher', 'Best', 'Director', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'Best', 'Original', 'Screenplay', 'Best', 'Editing', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'was', 'not', 'nominated', 'standout', 'performance', 'Streep', 'singing', 'Amazing', 'Grace', 'end', 'movie', 'kind', 'song-over', 'voice-over', 'very', 'effective', 'touched', 'emotions.The', 'only', 'problem', 'had', 'movie', 'assumed', 'viewers', 'knew', 'things', 'nuclear', 'example', 'Silkwood', 'employee', 'played', 'very', 'effectively', 'Craig', 'T.', 'Nelson', 'Coach', 'fame', 'altering', 'X-ray', 'photographs', 'fuel', 'rods', 'What', 'fuel', 'rod', 'Why', 'essential', 'have', 'imperfections', 'Later', ""'re"", 'told', 'fuel', 'rods', 'will', 'be', 'used', 'breeder', 'reactors', 'What', 'breeder', 'reactor', 'why', 'so', 'special', 'know', 'things', 'nuclear', 'thus', 'making', 'story', 'very', 'suspenseful', 'chilling', 'expect', 'viewers', 'know', 'such', 'things', 'think', 'was', 'unfair', 'Note', 'not', 'essential', 'understand', 'things', 'nuclear', 'knowing', 'such', 'stuff', 'will', 'enhance', 'enjoyment', 'movie.Finally', 'DVD', 'only', 'one', 'real', 'extra', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'movie.In', 'conclusion', 'fascinating', 'movie', 'story', 'unlikely', 'heroine', '1983', '2', 'hr', '10', 'min', '24', 'scenes', 'closed-captioned', '+++++']",N/A

ABC brought out the best acting of these original, talented actors who're not afraid to show their emotions in close-up and works especially under the lens of realist Mike Nichols.It is also a noteworthy fact that the real life character of Karen Silkwood and her then boyfriend Drew Stephens (who served as a consultant during shooting of this film) have met up with Cher at backstage during one of her road shows in the 70's. The coincidence of Cher's later golden opportunity of receiving the part in this film from director Nichols is just so d&eacute;j&agrave;vu in whole.Despite the said event, do not miss SILKWOOD by any chance for its heartfelt story of one person's undying courage to demand justice and the special bond between friends and lovers that matter!",4,Silkwood matters in our heart,1119225600,"06 20, 2005",2005,899,"['How', 'can', 'anyone', 'not', 'early', '80', 'gem', 'star-struck', 'Streep', 'young', 'hotshot', 'Russell', 'one', 'only', 'unique', 'Cher', 'ABC', 'brought', 'out', 'best', 'acting', 'original', 'talented', 'actors', 'who', ""'re"", 'not', 'afraid', 'show', 'emotions', 'close-up', 'especially', 'lens', 'realist', 'Mike', 'Nichols.It', 'also', 'noteworthy', 'fact', 'real', 'life', 'character', 'Karen', 'Silkwood', 'then', 'boyfriend', 'Drew', 'Stephens', 'who', 'served', 'consultant', 'shooting', 'film', 'have', 'met', 'up', 'Cher', 'backstage', 'one', 'road', '70', 'coincidence', 'Cher', 'later', 'golden', 'opportunity', 'receiving', 'part', 'film', 'director', 'Nichols', 'just', 'so', 'd', 'eacute', 'agrave', 'vu', 'said', 'event', 'do', 'not', 'miss', 'SILKWOOD', 'chance', 'heartfelt', 'story', 'one', 'person', 'undying', 'courage', 'demand', 'justice', 'special', 'bond', 'friends', 'lovers', 'matter']",N/A

Kurt Russell also puts in a brilliant performance.Silkwood is about Karen Silkwood who decides to publicise the danger that co-workers are exposed to at a plant she works.  This is brought on by contamination she has suffered while working there.  Overall, a very sad film.The only annoyance is Streep's constant (repeat, constant) smoking during the film.  That may have been Karen Silkwood's nature, but it seems pointless to the film.The DVD is very much worth owning.
