Billy Wilder made it a classic in `Sunset Boulevard'Sunset Boulevard (Special Collector's Edition).  While Steve Buscemi's 'Interview' isn't in the same category, his feature brings wit and irony front and center in an admirable fashion.Political reporter Pierre Peters (Buscemi) and soap opera star, Katya (Sienna Miller) in 'Sex in the City-esque 'City Girls,' spar with one another in what commences as an admirable update of `Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?.  During the opening scene they're at a restaurant, each interrupted at key times with cell phone calls.  (To sample the lack of subtlety, her cell phone goes off with the sounds of a feisty terrier.)  We find out later that he's intensely irritable for being reassigned from the political beat to interviewing acting celebrities.  Early on we also discover that both are forces to be reckoned with as they try to outwit one  another.Recovering from a restaurant debacle, most of the movie occurs at her place.  From tempest to tranquility, the film ebbs and flows in manic/depressive cycles.  Each time they start to calm down, they discover they have more in common than would have originally imagined.  Chemical dependency comes to the surface as she snorts cocaine, and he continues on a typical drinking binge.  Their intoxication has a sobering undertow as each tries to expose the other's vulnerability.  Both are formidable players in the tirades that come to roost in her apartment.In two keys scenes, each tries to unravel the other.  She takes her video camera and starts to interview him.  Similarly, he gets on her computer and does some investigating of his own.  The dirt each finds about the other is enough to undo the other unless someone is clever enough to win their intense sparring match.Cleverly scripted and devastatingly witty, 'Interview' turns the tables on assessments one makes on movies like 'Conversations with Other Women,'Conversations with Other Womenwhich seems spurious in comparison to this intense, although sometimes irritating, contest of wills.",3,'Vanity Fair',1197849600,"12 17, 2007",2007,2163,"['Somewhere', 'line', 'there', 'had', 'be', 'satire', 'movie', 'stars', 'reporters', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'made', 'classic', 'Sunset', ""Boulevard'Sunset"", 'Boulevard', 'Special', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', ""'Interview"", ""n't"", 'same', 'category', 'feature', 'wit', 'irony', 'front', 'center', 'admirable', 'fashion.Political', 'reporter', 'Pierre', 'Peters', 'Buscemi', 'opera', 'star', 'Katya', 'Sienna', 'Miller', ""'Sex"", 'City-esque', ""'City"", 'Girls', 'spar', 'one', 'what', 'commences', 'admirable', 'update', 'Who', 'Afraid', 'Virginia', 'Woolf', 'Afraid', 'Virginia', 'Woolf', 'opening', 'scene', ""'re"", 'restaurant', 'interrupted', 'key', 'times', 'cell', 'phone', 'sample', 'lack', 'subtlety', 'cell', 'phone', 'sounds', 'feisty', 'terrier', 'find', 'out', 'later', 'intensely', 'irritable', 'being', 'reassigned', 'political', 'beat', 'interviewing', 'acting', 'celebrities', 'Early', 'also', 'discover', 'are', 'forces', 'be', 'reckoned', 'try', 'outwit', 'one', 'another.Recovering', 'restaurant', 'debacle', 'most', 'movie', 'place', 'tempest', 'tranquility', 'film', 'ebbs', 'manic/depressive', 'cycles', 'time', 'start', 'calm', 'down', 'discover', 'have', 'more', 'common', 'would', 'have', 'originally', 'imagined', 'Chemical', 'dependency', 'surface', 'cocaine', 'typical', 'drinking', 'binge', 'intoxication', 'sobering', 'undertow', 'tries', 'expose', 'other', 'vulnerability', 'are', 'formidable', 'players', 'tirades', 'come', 'roost', 'apartment.In', 'two', 'keys', 'scenes', 'tries', 'unravel', 'other', 'video', 'camera', 'interview', 'Similarly', 'computer', 'investigating', 'own', 'dirt', 'other', 'enough', 'undo', 'other', 'someone', 'clever', 'enough', 'win', 'intense', 'sparring', 'match.Cleverly', 'scripted', 'devastatingly', 'witty', ""'Interview"", 'tables', 'assessments', 'one', 'movies', ""'Conversations"", 'Other', 'Women', ""'Conversations"", 'Other', 'Womenwhich', 'spurious', 'comparison', 'intense', 'sometimes', 'irritating', 'contest', 'wills']",Interview
1108160,ADLVFFE4VBT8,B000WC38WI,"A. Dent ""Aragorn""","[0, 0]","... like a woman scornedI knew of Steve Buscemi prior to watching Interview but I doubt I've heard of Sienna Miller before and that's too bad because, unless she's playing the part of her life as Katia (the cheap thrills movies star and darling of the tabloids) in ""Inteview"" I'd like to see a lot more of her, playing major parts in major future releases. Seriously.Surprisingly watchable, ""Interview"" feels and plays a lot like an off- or maybe off-off-Broadway... play, and this is not meant to be a negative. It's basically 2 people, Buscemi - an unscrupulous war correspondent/political reporter turned 'fluff piece' interviewer - and Katia - the supposedly empty-headed but sexy all-over starlet - sizing each other up and playing a complex game of seduction, true and/or made-up confessions, gradually and reluctantly revealing each other their darkest secrets. Or so it seems. But not everything is the way it appears to be and, in the end, we get the well-earned and much-deserved catharsis.Sienna Miller is simply brilliant as Katia: seductive, talented, entertaining, convincing making us to want to see more of her in more 'serious' movies. Buscemi... well... maybe he's not too convincing as a sex object but he is quite good as the cheating reporter making up sources and stories and in the process of being downgraded to the 'page six' beat. The two of them plus an abundance of alcohol, tobacco and some not so legal drugs managed to keep me interested for the movie's duration and that's all I needed on a Sunday evening.To sum it up, ""Interview"" is not groundbreaking art but it's a clever script, a brilliant play by Miller and a good Buscemi performance, demonstrating that he can do more than episodic parts as target for other people's fists. A 4-star rating is fair.______________________________Note:The movie is R-rated, probably for language (maybe a couple dozen f... can be heard but not much else) and for showing some copious and near continuous consumption of alcohol, tobacco and illegal drugs. While the sexual tension is so strong, you can almost smell the pheromones, there is no nudity and nothing explicit takes place beyond some kissing and close dancing.",4,Hell hath no fury...,1266710400,"02 21, 2010",2010,2193,"['woman', 'knew', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'prior', 'watching', 'Interview', 'doubt', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'Sienna', 'Miller', 'too', 'bad', 'playing', 'part', 'life', 'Katia', 'cheap', 'movies', 'star', 'darling', 'tabloids', 'Inteview', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'lot', 'more', 'playing', 'major', 'parts', 'major', 'future', 'releases', 'Seriously.Surprisingly', 'watchable', 'Interview', 'feels', 'lot', 'off-', 'maybe', 'off-off-Broadway', 'play', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'negative', 'basically', '2', 'people', 'Buscemi', 'unscrupulous', 'war', 'correspondent/political', 'reporter', 'turned', ""'fluff"", 'piece', 'interviewer', 'Katia', 'supposedly', 'empty-headed', 'sexy', 'all-over', 'starlet', 'sizing', 'other', 'up', 'playing', 'complex', 'game', 'seduction', 'true', 'and/or', 'made-up', 'confessions', 'gradually', 'reluctantly', 'revealing', 'other', 'darkest', 'secrets', 'not', 'everything', 'way', 'be', 'end', 'get', 'well-earned', 'much-deserved', 'catharsis.Sienna', 'Miller', 'simply', 'brilliant', 'Katia', 'seductive', 'talented', 'entertaining', 'convincing', 'making', 'want', 'see', 'more', 'more', ""'serious"", 'movies', 'Buscemi', 'well', 'maybe', 'not', 'too', 'convincing', 'sex', 'object', 'quite', 'good', 'cheating', 'reporter', 'making', 'up', 'sources', 'stories', 'process', 'being', 'downgraded', ""'page"", 'six', 'beat', 'two', 'abundance', 'alcohol', 'tobacco', 'not', 'legal', 'drugs', 'managed', 'keep', 'interested', 'movie', 'duration', 'needed', 'Sunday', 'evening.To', 'sum', 'up', 'Interview', 'not', 'groundbreaking', 'art', 'clever', 'script', 'brilliant', 'play', 'Miller', 'good', 'Buscemi', 'performance', 'demonstrating', 'can', 'do', 'more', 'episodic', 'parts', 'target', 'other', 'people', 'fists', '4-star', 'rating', 'fair.______________________________Note', 'movie', 'R-rated', 'probably', 'language', 'maybe', 'couple', 'dozen', 'f', 'can', 'be', 'heard', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'showing', 'copious', 'continuous', 'consumption', 'alcohol', 'tobacco', 'illegal', 'drugs', 'sexual', 'tension', 'so', 'strong', 'can', 'almost', 'smell', 'pheromones', 'nudity', 'nothing', 'explicit', 'place', 'kissing', 'close', 'dancing']",Interview

However, if Murray and Johanson's on-screen relationship was warm and nurturing, the relationship between Buscemi's Pierre and Miller's Katya is more like a cage match.Pierre, a self-important political journalist, is assigned to do an interview with a subject he believes to be beneath him ... Katya, a schlock TV/film actress and tabloid fixture. The two characters clash instantly, but end up continuing the ""interview"" all night in Katya's opulent New York loft, where the two characters ridicule, antagonize, manipulate, charm, seduce and abuse one another, both for their own career agendas and to satisfy their equally inflated egos. Steve Buscemi (clearly a talented director as well as being a great character actor) and Sienna Miller both give terrific performances playing these two complex, layered and often repugnant characters. I found the whole thing fascinating.Toward the end of the film Pierre tells Katya ""What do we both have in common? Neither of us believes in relationships.

1108165,A1PV2Q6K7EVFTG,B000WC38WI,Gary Rinkerman,"[2, 2]","This film should be rented or watched on television before you decide whether to purchase a copy of it.Both Steve Buscemi and Sienna Miller (especially Miller) are among the finest contemporary actors - so it is almost always a pleasure to watch their work.  However, this film consists primarily of over an hour of improbable and sophomoric dialogue between Pierre (Buscemi), a failed, morally-flawed (yet self-righteous) journalist and Katya (Miller), a self-absorbed, manipulative actress who, alternatively, pities and preys upon the unlucky Pierre.  Through a series of interchanges between the characters, we learn (over and over) that they peddle fiction to their respective audiences and, at times, to themselves - but this is easy to pick up during the first ten minutes of the film.  The rest of the film seems intent on exploring how many ways this basic message can be delivered and redelivered.The majority of the interchanges between Pierre and Katya take place in Katya's bohemian apartment, so the film - especially with its minimalist camera work and limited space - often creates the feeling of an intimate stage play.  This would be fine if the writing allowed the characters to expand beyond those limited confines and become interesting.  However, both Miller and Buscemi (who also directed)are repeatedly forced to try to ""emotionally charge"" the alternatively petty and ""heavy"" dialogue that is aimed at showing, as Warhol would have put it, that each character is, in his or her own way, ""deeply superficial"": Imagine two actors forced to take a really good five-minute Tennessee Williams scene and stretch it out for over an hour.  Mid-way through the film (or sooner), you will probably stop caring.The silver lining in this otherwise forgettable film is the incredible range of Miller and Buscemi's mastery of quirky character.

1108166,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000WC38WI,Grady Harp,"[10, 11]","INTERVIEW is a smart little independent film adapted from the 2003 Theo van Gogh film by the same name, a film that drew a lot of attention based on a script by Theodor Holman, which in turn was based on an idea by Hans Teeuwen sparring the famous Dutch actress Katja Schuurman with actor Pierre Bokma. In this adaptation Steve Buscemi reworked the Holman screenplay with the help of David Schechter, changing the female role to a tabloid type bombshell actress (also named Katya, played with razor sharp clarity by Sienna Miller) with a disgruntle political reporter Pierre (Steve Buscemi) whose career is on the skids requiring that he take lousy assignments such as this interview to stay alive.Other than a disastrous opening in a classy restaurant where the two characters realize they are ridiculously mismatched as an interview pair, the entire film takes place in Katya's loft. Katya appears shallow and short of goals and Pierre only acquiesces to complete the interview when he suffers a head injury and is invited for ice and drink to Katya's place.  What ensues is a battle of wits in which each of the two characters discovers more about each other than either cares to disclose, and after a 'mating dance' of sorts the two return to their separate corners of the boxing ring - each having a final twist on the other's private life.  It is a play within a play and the words make all the difference.Sienna Miller is becoming one of the more important actresses on the screen and in this role she proves her mettle in a superbly nuanced role.  Steve Buscemi may not have been the optimal choice to play Pierre, but he is sharp to watch and is never short of intelligence, both as an actor and as a writer/director. Not an action movie and not a film for those who need strong narrative, but for viewers who enjoy the barbs and wit of a sparring match, this is a well-made example of the genre.

1108169,A3U3BEZMH3F01Q,B000WC38WI,maskirovka,"[0, 0]","""Interview"" starts out very strong with some very sharp dialogue and witty exchanges.  The set up reminds me some of a movie called ""Conversations with Other Women"" starring Helena Bonham Carter and Aaron Eckhardt in that it is mostly a two person and one scene play.  But ""Conversations"" was better than ""Interview"" in that the dialogue and emotions remained consistently believable throughout the film, and this is VERY important, both of the characters were likeable and plausible and you wanted them to be with each other.Conversation(s) With Other WomenThere are moments where Buscemi (who is a great actor) and Miller (who did a fine job with what she had) came across as very believable and sympathetic.  But somewhere around the mid-point of the flick, Miller's Katya sort of morphed into a pathetic, coke snorting nut and Buscemi came across as a complete phony (when he told Katya ""I care about you...I really do,"" I found myself rolling my eyes and thinking ""yeah right."")There are three other defects to the movie that I will have to tag with the SPOILERS warning...see belowSPOILERS1. I don't think that this movie played straight with its viewers.  Almost to the end, we were given the impression that Buscemi and Miller's characters actually had come to care about each other at least a bit.  But then, the plot twist threw all that out the window and suddenly it became ""battle of wits between the movie star and the washed-up journalist"").  Frankly, I would have preferred a straightforward setup where either Buscemi and Miller did become friends or a setup where you knew they were adversaries from the start.2.  The twist where Buscemi discovers what he thinks is Miller's diary (but which turns out to be that of her character in a soap opera that she wrote out as an acting lesson) was so obvious I spotted it immediately and found myself thinking, ""Dear God, don't let that be the twist ending.""3.  Given the fact that Buscemi's character was planning all along to betray the trust that Miller had ostensibly placed in him, I totally didn't believe he would ""share"" (let alone on videotape) his darkest personal secrets.  I think that it would have made a much better ending if after Miller told him she had the tape and was thinking about sending it to the police or his boss if Buscemi had said, ""What makes you think I told you the truth about me...incidentally I took a few acting classes so I know how to say something that's complete BS and make it sound like the truth just like you did.""END SPOILERSSo I would give this film 3 stars for a strong first half and hope that Buscemi and Miller will partner in some future enterprise.

This may have been designed to be an acting tour de force by a couple actors, but it was not.  This gave me the impression that it was made as a project for a college acting class.  The twist at the end was sooooo lame that I called it as soon as the journalist peeked onto the starlet's computer.  This was a twist I saw coming and kept saying to myself:  ""Please be wrong.  Please be wrong.""  Sigh, I wasn't wrong.  Another issue I had was the countless times the writer threatened to leave and did not or the countless times the starlet ordered him out then changed her mind.  But what really bothered me about this work, other than the lack of plot, bad dialogue and totally unlikeable characters was the drug and alcohol consumption.  Between the two main characters, they drank more wine in 84 minutes than I could consume in a week and, except for about 30 seconds, never got even tipsy and then after that 30 second display of drunkenness, were sober again for the rest of the film.  Nobody could drink that much and still be standing, let alone hatching plots.  The description on the cover refers to a verbal chess game.

1108172,AJRFZ0VZ0LD26,B000WC38WI,"Reader ""Eugenia""","[0, 0]","Smart movie starring two excellent actors Sienna Miller and Steve Buscemi.  This unlikely pair will keep you engaged from start to finish.  Sienna plays Katya, young, pretty, seemingly shallow acress who takes on roles in daytime soap operas and thriller movies.  Pierre is jaded war correspondent, sarcastic, middle aged and more or less wasted.  Pierre's job is to interview the starlet as part of his editor's People Profile column.  Surely, neither people profile not the startlet herself is the kind of writing that Pierre wishes to do.  He would prefer to be in Washington, DC following up with the latest political topsy-turvy of the capital's national politics.  Circumstances place these two in Katya's apartment where they verbally battle each other out for both their  career and personal choices.  It is apparent that both of them are damaged and as such incapable of compassion and decent human interaction.  Both have a goal and use their professions to win over the other individual.  Which one of these two consummate actors will win at the end?  Will it be the youth and inexperience, or perpetually unhappy worldliness?

Yes, it's riveting - perhaps the film's deftist feat is its way of hooking the viewer back in every time the two characters threaten to part ways. But by the end I hated the actress and wasn't terribly fond of the journalist. I felt like I'd been enmeshed in the lives of two people unworthy of my time and attention. Also depressing was the ageist message/resolution. Made me nostalgic for films in which age and experience counts for something durable and respectable.

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[9, 10]","This is the first of three films, which are American remakes of feature films directed in the Netherlands by the late Theo van Gogh. Actor/Director Buscemi was specifically chosen by the original producer to direct the film. He chose the lead role for himself. I have not seen the ""original"" and am basing my comments just on viewing the DVD of this US version.The film is 85 minutes long and, except for 2-3 minutes at the beginning, and even less at the end, there are only two actors on the screen talking and interacting with each other. And nearly all the action takes place in one New York City apartment - though it is a big loft apartment! And yet this is not a quiet conversational film like ""My Dinner With Andre"". There is definitely a sexual thing going on here but you'll note that the R rating is for ""language and strong sexual situations"", not nudity. There is no nakedness at all. Yet, like some of the prime scenes in ""Body Heat"", there is definitely sexual tension in the air. And, not unlike ""Body Heat"" this is an emotional duel between a man and a woman where what is said is not always the truth.I was not familiar with lead actress Sienna Miller before this film. (I loved Buscemi in ""Ghost World""). Until I watched the two featurettes (the requisite ""Making of...."" and a brief interview with Director/Star Buscemi), I was not aware that Miller is British. She has an LA accent down pat. And it's perfect.Note that the locale can be a bit confusing. Miller's character is a TV actress and is hounded by Paparazzi so the film should be set in LA. But the loft set and the mention of being in Washington in a few hours, gives the viewer the impression that it's in lower Manhattan. But you'll find yourself listening to the words and watching the chemistry between the two characters that you won't even think about it until the film is over.This is not a great film that will win big awards. It's an ""independent"" And for the 90 minutes or so that you are watching this DVD you won't find your mind wandering or getting bored. Give it a chance.
