1691820,A1395FJWA9H7TA,B00HRUQB5O,,"[11, 14]","First let me say that I ordered this set because I wanted to have seasons 5 & 6. I already have seasons 1-4. I expected this set to be an upgrade - with restored episodes.I am disappointed. I don't see a big difference in the quality of the seasons 1-4 episodes. Seasons 5 & 6 do not look like they've been restored or cleaned up much. Some episodes in season 5 are a bit dark - Bob's sports jacket is so dark in one scene that it blends into the background. Is this called bad contrast?Season 5 episodes s (maybe others ) have the MTM logo then a Viacom logo then the Fox logo at the end of the credits, so maybe these are made from copies used in syndication - but as far as I can tell, the episodes are complete.Sound sync is off of a bit on two of the  episodes (so far - I have not seen them all)As for the extras - There is one bonus disk that has the original pilot (which I really enjoyed - Jerry is Bob's partner in his psychology practice in this pilot). It also has a round table discussion with Bob and the surviving cast - . And the Reunion special from the early 90's. As far as I can tell, there are no other bonus features - no gag real or out takes. There are some episodes with commentary. Also - No subtitles.  Maybe I'm missing something. If anyone else can find the bonus features I can't find, let me know.There is a nice booklet that comes with the set, with a short essay about the show, and episode listings.I expected more from Shout Factory.

It is wonderful that shout picked up where fox dropped the ball..... but why a box set!?!?  Not fair for those of us waiting somewhat patiently for the release of TWO SEASONS.We all need to do what we did with Mary Tyler Moore!  One star ratings and complaints,  it worked once it can work again!  Please don't give in and buy the complete set.  They need to learn they can't keep doing this.  Especially to the better shows from the 70s.I'm sure you all have 1-4 as I do and have been waiting for Fox to finish with this WONDERFUL show, but to gouge us with a tab of 119.00 for 2 seasons is not right.SHOUT! Do the right thing and have the box set, plus seasons 5 & 6 for us to finish our collection of Bob Newhart.  I love this show, the cast, the humor, comedic timing,  can't be matched by many shows and this one has it all!Update: We contacted SHOUT! They say they will release 5 and 6 separately.... one can only hope! And for those rating not helpful...how do you expect things to change if you don't try to change them!  If not for all the one star people, Mary Tyler Moore would have stayed a box set!  We should not have to pay 119 to get 2 seasons.  Let's hope shout stands by their word and this one star rating can be taken down. Try to be helpful not a hindrance Thank you.EDIT 5/8/14:When this review was written the price was $119 for the set.  So, at $119, if you need all 6 - $119 is not that good a price - but if you only need the last 2 as many of us do - it was even worse.As of February (THREE months ago) when I wrote this you could get 1-4 on here still - Season one is 12.44, Season 2 is 11.86, Season 3 is 12.33 and Season 4 is 12.42 - that added up is 49.05.So maybe Amazon saw my math on another page adding up the total for the set being a fair -price at $80 not $119.  So the new 79.99 for 6 is a fairer price, but why pay 40 a piece for getting the only 2 we need??? Most of us bought them as they came out and don't need season 1-4 - just be fair and release them separately.",1,Don't let them do this again!!,1392940800,"02 21, 2014",2014,2061,"['Bob', 'Newhart', 'one', 'BEST', 'shows', '70s', 'wonderful', 'shout', 'picked', 'up', 'where', 'fox', 'dropped', 'ball', 'why', 'box', 'set', 'Not', 'fair', 'waiting', 'somewhat', 'patiently', 'release', 'TWO', 'SEASONS.We', 'need', 'do', 'what', 'did', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'One', 'star', 'ratings', 'complaints', 'worked', 'can', 'work', 'again', 'Please', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'buy', 'complete', 'set', 'need', 'learn', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'doing', 'Especially', 'better', 'shows', '70s.I', ""'m"", 'sure', 'have', '1-4', 'do', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'Fox', 'finish', 'WONDERFUL', 'show', 'gouge', 'tab', '119.00', '2', 'seasons', 'not', 'right.SHOUT', 'Do', 'right', 'thing', 'have', 'box', 'set', 'seasons', '5', '6', 'finish', 'collection', 'Bob', 'Newhart', 'love', 'show', 'cast', 'humor', 'comedic', 'timing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'matched', 'many', 'shows', 'one', 'Update', 'contacted', 'SHOUT', 'say', 'will', 'release', '5', '6', 'separately', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'rating', 'not', 'helpful', 'how', 'do', 'expect', 'things', 'change', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'change', 'not', 'one', 'star', 'people', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'would', 'have', 'stayed', 'box', 'set', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'pay', '119', 'get', '2', 'seasons', 'Let', 'hope', 'shout', 'stands', 'word', 'one', 'star', 'rating', 'can', 'be', 'taken', 'down', 'Try', 'be', 'helpful', 'not', 'hindrance', 'Thank', '5/8/14', 'When', 'review', 'was', 'written', 'price', 'was', '119', 'set', 'So', '119', 'need', '6', '119', 'not', 'that', 'price', 'only', 'need', 'last', '2', 'many', 'do', 'was', 'even', 'worse.As', 'February', 'THREE', 'months', 'ago', 'when', 'wrote', 'could', 'get', '1-4', 'here', 'still', 'Season', 'one', '12.44', 'Season', '2', '11.86', 'Season', '3', '12.33', 'Season', '4', '12.42', 'added', 'up', '49.05.So', 'maybe', 'Amazon', 'saw', 'math', 'page', 'adding', 'up', 'total', 'set', 'being', 'fair', '-price', '80', 'not', '119', 'So', 'new', '79.99', '6', 'fairer', 'price', 'why', 'pay', '40', 'piece', 'getting', 'only', '2', 'need', 'Most', 'bought', 'came', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'season', '1-4', 'just', 'be', 'fair', 'release', 'separately']",N/A

1691843,A413ABZIU3RBS,B00HRUQB5O,Robert J. Keil,"[91, 95]","Looks like I'm the first reviewer to have actually received and viewed (at least in part) this set, having pre-ordered it from Shout who delivered it five weeks before the official release date.BACKGROUND: The Bob Newhart Show is my favorite show in the history of television. I've bought every VHS and DVD release available over the years, and have been making recordings off the air for 20 years in an effort to collect (and then ""upgrade"" the quality of) all the episodes in this series. My expectations for this set are high since the show deserves the best DVD release possible. Fox released the first four seasons in 2005 and 2006, only to leave fans hanging for 8 years for the last two seasons. Luckily, Shout Factory took the opportunity to release the Bob Newhart Show the way it should have been from the beginning - as a complete series set. Yes, this means hardcore fans like me have DVDs, VHS tapes, and old DVD-R recordings that we don't need anymore. So sell the old ones or give them away. To me it's a small price to pay to get this set.THE SHOW ITSELF: Not much to say other than what you likely already know - The Bob Newhart Show is generally regarded as one of the greatest sitcoms of all time. Its rare combination of amazing writing, a top-notch cast, and a style of humor that is at once accessible and sophisticated, is a high water mark in the history of television.PACKAGING: The set comes in a standard height box with 3 Amaray-style cases that holds 6 discs apiece. Gone are the two-sided Fox discs with cheesy cartoon-themed menus. Here, discs for Seasons 1 and 2 are in one case, seasons 3 and 4 in a second case and seasons 5 and 6 are in the third case. These are NOT stacked on a spindle and thus are easily accessible. The disc faces feature nice 1970s-inspired artwork across all discs with color variations for each case. The fourth (bonus disc) case is a standard height but slim. The menus for each disc are based on the look of Bob's office door. Everything is classy and everything matches.AUDIO AND VIDEO QUALITY: The Bob Newhart Show has always had quality issues on broadcast and video release as far back as I remember, and sadly this release is no exception. Over the years I've assumed that the transfers we've seen are taken from either second-generation prints, 16mm dupes, or analog-sharpened film-to-tape transfers. Other sitcoms shot on film in this era look better. If anybody has inside information on the condition of the original or edited film elements I'd love to know the story. So generally the contrast on most episodes it too high and harsh looking, there is a lot of grain, and most episodes are pretty de-saturated and the color temperature is too magenta in my opinion. Sound is also a bit harsh and thin in most episodes. My guess is that Shout has used the best original material available, and I have certainly never seen this series look or sound better than it does in this DVD set. So it's just decent, and probably limited to being so just by the nature of the source material.EXTRAS: Every episode I've watched so far is uncut and runs about 25 minutes. Shout appears to have carried over the commentary tracks from the Fox discs. The 40-page booklet is very nicely designed, well written by sitcom expert Vince Waldron, and organized so you can find the episode titles, plot summaries, and airdates easily. The 19th Anniversary reunion show from 1991 is a 1-hour ""clip show"" that is just okay. It's nice to see the actors again, but not much actually happens other than setting up the clips which are (by themselves) great. The ""Group Therapy"" extra is a sit-down studio conversation with cast and crew that is very entertaining and insightful and lasts most of an hour. The unaired pilot is a real treat, and is quite different from the show as we would know it later.CONCLUSION: It great to finally see this show get the treatment it deserves with this Complete Series DVD release. The packaging, tasteful and consistent menus and disc artwork, full-length episodes, and extras are a fitting presentation. Other than some picture and sound quality issues that are probably inherent in the source material, there's little room for improvement in this set. Unless somebody finds some ""lost"" negatives or higher-quality masters in a vault or basement somewhere and makes a high-def blu-ray transfer of them, this is probably the best presentation of the Bob Newhart Show we will ever get. Overall well worth the money and a set to be re-watched for many years to come. The concept and execution of ""the sitcom"" just doesn't get any better than the Bob Newhart Show, specifically as it is delivered in this DVD set.

Imagine what these first four season sets will look like on single sided discs, restored, and professionally produced by ShoutFactory!Thank you ShoutFactory! for answering the call of the consumer. I'll proudly spend my money with you!**UPDATE 4/25/2014:I received an advanced copy from Shout!Factory and I can tell you that each disc is single-sided and there is a significant improvement with the audio from the FOX seasons, as well as, a marked improvement with the video. Shout!Factory took extra care for this release.For instance, several episodes from the FOX releases clipped the main title from the opening credits. Comparing the same episodes with the Shout!Factory release, the main titles are intact and all of the words are included. There are no episodes with muddled audio, either.The Bonus Disc was out of this world. You get 50 minutes of the surviving cast talking about the show. It was recorded in December 2013, so Shout!Factory pulled out all of the stops to do this release justice. In addition, there are two more extras, including the unaired pilot episode with different characters.In addition, there is an amazing book included that has an easy to read explanation as to how they show came about, stayed on the network, and left while it was still on top in the ratings.Seasons 1 & 2 are in one DVD case. Seasons 3 & 4 are in a separate DVD case. Seasons 5 & 6 are in a separate DVD case. The bonus disc is also separate. All are contained, along with the book, in the big box.Now, here is the not-so-good news regarding Season 5 Disc 1 - ""A Crime Most Foul"". It has a very noticeable sync problem. I contacted Shout!Factory to see if I was sent a defective disc and they replied that the master they had access to and used also had the sync problem. I'm not sure if Shout!Factory had access to the original broadcast master because the show was shot on film and I also don't believe CBS would have allowed it to air that way. Regardless, the master that Shout!Factory has access to is the problem, not your individual disc.Other than that, sit back and enjoy The Bob Newhart Show the way it was intended to be enjoyed.
