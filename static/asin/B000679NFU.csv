The two I saw before this, Manor House and 1940 House, were wildly entertaining as well as full of sociological and cultural insights.Unfortunately, Regency House Party trashes the concept. It is little more than ""Big Brother"" in period dress. Essentially, they've just brought a group of rather uninteresting people into a matchmaking situation. The setting and costumes seem nothing more than trimmings, and the cultural lessons are abruptly inserted at regular intervals.All that would be acceptable if it resulted in some form of entertainment, but it does not. Almost all the participants seem bored to tears as they're put through their paces, and the viewer is left with nothing.

The 1900 house, colonial house, frontier house, 1940's house,  and Manor House, For some reason i am a sucker for ripping away modern Convieniances from poor helpless people and plunking them smack dab in the middle of chamberpots and candles. This installment in the series, Regency House Party, is a 6 hour frustrating repetitive anti climatic mess. Five men and Five women are given status in the house based on thier real life families and jobs, we are supposed to see them form relationships and than agree or disagree to a ""fake"" marriage, The goal of the women is to marry rich, and marry up, the goal of the men is to bag a good breeder, preferably marry for money and stuff thier trousers. I suppose we are meant to observe how frustrating it was for women back then, stuck with strict chaperones confined to the house, never to jump and run about with the men, oh its so unfair that they are to have ""lots of babies"" and ""one in three"" will die in childbirth. One of them decides that instead of being a ""baby machine"" she will become a ""courtesan""...a prostitute, because thats so much better and its ""her"" choice. yep Syph, starvation, and millions of abortions is my kind of life. I would have taken the 1 in 3 bet.None of these people, not one really got what it was all about. The men were too busy trying to seduce chaperones, out drink eachother, and oggle all the pushed up busoms they seriously didnt care about marrying these women, even if it was fake. The women were too busy complaining about the lack of feminine hygiene, and how they had to be chaste, and how it was ultimately boring being them. One of them, the ""industrial hieress"" Victoria Hopkins see sawed between ""snogging"" mr Everett and slobbering all over mr carrington, I swear 5 hours of this series was devoted to her ""dilemma"" and how she should think with her head not her heart, she goes back and forth so much that by the end when she goes for the money, you wish she had choked on all the rose petals these men threw at her.The Chaperones were pitiful as well, grown women throwing slaps and demanding apologies left and right, fans and plates across rooms, meeting men in the barn for a ""ghost watch"" (presumably the ghost of supple past)I read an interview with Chris Gorell Barnes who was the ""top"" man, that he didnt learn a thing and that he was getting it on with the chambermaid who was actually his valets girlfriend.I suppose i really wanted these men and women to seriously act thier parts, follow through, leave the 21st century BS behind. Embrace the lifestyle and in turn learn something about modern romance through regency relationships, but NONE of them came out of this with an Iota of clarity.So I lost 6 hours, these people lost two months and not the better for it.",1,"Save yourself, do not watch this unless you want to lose 6 hours",1171238400,"02 12, 2007",2007,2824,"['have', 'watched', 'PBS', 'house', 'series', '1900', 'house', 'colonial', 'house', 'frontier', 'house', '1940', 'house', 'Manor', 'House', 'reason', 'i', 'am', 'sucker', 'ripping', 'away', 'modern', 'Convieniances', 'poor', 'helpless', 'people', 'plunking', 'smack', 'dab', 'middle', 'chamberpots', 'candles', 'installment', 'series', 'Regency', 'House', 'Party', '6', 'hour', 'frustrating', 'repetitive', 'anti', 'climatic', 'mess', 'Five', 'men', 'Five', 'women', 'are', 'given', 'status', 'house', 'based', 'thier', 'real', 'life', 'families', 'jobs', 'are', 'supposed', 'see', 'form', 'relationships', 'agree', 'disagree', 'fake', 'marriage', 'goal', 'women', 'marry', 'rich', 'marry', 'up', 'goal', 'men', 'bag', 'good', 'breeder', 'preferably', 'marry', 'money', 'stuff', 'thier', 'trousers', 'suppose', 'are', 'meant', 'observe', 'how', 'frustrating', 'was', 'women', 'back', 'then', 'stuck', 'strict', 'chaperones', 'confined', 'house', 'never', 'jump', 'run', 'about', 'men', 'oh', 'so', 'unfair', 'are', 'have', 'lots', 'babies', 'one', 'three', 'will', 'die', 'childbirth', 'One', 'instead', 'being', 'baby', 'machine', 'will', 'become', 'courtesan', 'prostitute', 'thats', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'choice', 'yep', 'Syph', 'starvation', 'millions', 'abortions', 'kind', 'life', 'would', 'have', 'taken', '1', '3', 'bet.None', 'people', 'not', 'one', 'really', 'got', 'what', 'was', 'men', 'were', 'too', 'busy', 'trying', 'seduce', 'chaperones', 'drink', 'eachother', 'pushed', 'up', 'busoms', 'seriously', 'care', 'marrying', 'women', 'even', 'was', 'fake', 'women', 'were', 'too', 'busy', 'complaining', 'lack', 'feminine', 'hygiene', 'how', 'had', 'be', 'chaste', 'how', 'was', 'ultimately', 'boring', 'being', 'One', 'industrial', 'hieress', 'Victoria', 'Hopkins', 'see', 'sawed', 'snogging', 'mr', 'Everett', 'slobbering', 'mr', 'carrington', 'swear', '5', 'hours', 'series', 'was', 'devoted', 'dilemma', 'how', 'should', 'think', 'head', 'not', 'heart', 'back', 'forth', 'so', 'much', 'end', 'when', 'money', 'wish', 'had', 'choked', 'rose', 'petals', 'men', 'threw', 'her.The', 'Chaperones', 'were', 'pitiful', 'as', 'well', 'grown', 'women', 'throwing', 'slaps', 'demanding', 'apologies', 'left', 'right', 'fans', 'plates', 'rooms', 'meeting', 'men', 'barn', 'ghost', 'watch', 'presumably', 'ghost', 'supple', 'past', 'read', 'interview', 'Chris', 'Gorell', 'Barnes', 'who', 'was', 'top', 'man', 'thing', 'was', 'getting', 'chambermaid', 'who', 'was', 'actually', 'valets', 'girlfriend.I', 'suppose', 'i', 'really', 'wanted', 'men', 'women', 'seriously', 'act', 'thier', 'parts', 'follow', 'leave', '21st', 'century', 'BS', 'Embrace', 'lifestyle', 'turn', 'learn', 'something', 'modern', 'romance', 'regency', 'relationships', 'NONE', 'came', 'out', 'Iota', 'clarity.So', 'lost', '6', 'hours', 'people', 'lost', 'two', 'months', 'not', 'better']",Regency House Party
862108,A28WJUJF6D2ULA,B000679NFU,Dai-keag-ity,"[4, 5]","Of all the recent reality ""House"" series shown by PBS, such as 1900 House, Manor House, Frontier House, Colonial House, and others, this is the one that succeeds most brilliantly in escaping the present and re-capturing more fluidly the bygone era toward which the producers of this sociological project were grasping. This 2004 presentation is by far the most entertaining in the line of shows that document the experiences and reactions of twenty-first-century women and men who find themselves dealing with moral protocol and technology as it existed in the past.Here concentrating on the year 1811 in Great Britain's Regency era (so called because the Prince of Wales was elevated to Regent in the face of his father, George III's, incurable psychological illness), five unmarried women and five unwed men, along with five middle-aged female chaperones, are ensconced in a lovely manor house and adjacent property in the hills of Herefordshire. For nine weeks of summer, these couples interact within the complicated restrictions of Regency courtship, and the relationships that spring up are recorded. The roles played by modern people take broad lines and range from a sea captain, a wealthy industrialist, a landed gentleman, an army officer, to a (secretly penniless) Russian countess, the daughter of a nouveau riche commercialist, a spirited but lowly female companion to a chaperone, and above all of them, the stern, goddess-like figure of the acting hostess and matchmaker, the dauntingly proper Mrs. Rogers.I found the amount of detail and imagination that was invested in Regency House Party was what took this from a dry bit of otherwise well-intended pretend time travel, to something genuinely entertaining.

Romantic gestures like that one, as well as having servants sneak love notes into the room of your amour, arranging a fireworks display, and reenacting the naval battle of Trafalgar happen aplenty in his entry in the historical ""House"" series, and I found it enchanting.I felt that most of the volunteers genuinely did their best to put aside their modern personas and to react and behave as they would have in 1811.  Of course there were some jarringly anachronistic displays of swearing, inappropriate flirtations and young girls sneaking off for secret rendezvous with men. But all in all, up until the last night (when the chaperones had gone), the modern young men and women did a fine job of behaving as was expected of them.

This era in time was very similar. Chaperones were in charge of young girls of marrying age; their job was to ensure a good financial match for their charges. This house recreates that time with four (and later five) girls and an equal amount of elligible bachelors for them to choose from. It is all about finding a suitable match while living under the code of the regency house days. Modesty is of the utmost importance here and status is everything. The guests include women with titles to men with the means to buy theirs all the way down to a hermit who lives on the grounds. The limits on the behavior of the couples might give the false impression that this series will be boring, but it is anything but. The slow dance is fascinating to see and educational as well.Although it is obvious that a full re-encarnation of the regency period could not be put into effect because the guests are aware that they will return to their normal lives, it is interesting to see them coupling off anyway. The same rules of the 1810s do not apply to these relationships after the two months is over, so the women do not take status or the need to find a husband as seriously as they would if they did. However, the isolation of the day and the drastically different moral code does affect the matchmaking.This series makes an excellent companion to Manor House. Both are set in England, though they are certainly a length of time apart, but this series focuses on the lives of the elite while Manor House delves into a life of servitude.Unfortunately, the ending is somewhat abrupt and despite the six hour length of the series, it seems rather short.

862116,A2Y55P7L3NFZ2F,B000679NFU,"T. Thompson ""Clydesight Productions""","[1, 1]","The title, ""Regency House Party"" may at first sound like some kind of frat movie comedy but it is in fact a sort of reality TV series produced for PBS in many episodes.In case it isn't obvious, the premise is similar to shows like ""Prairie House"" and ""1900's House"", wherein 21st Century people live for a time completely immersed in the social order and customs of Regency England... at a Manor house, complete with costumes, morals, manners, food, customs and so on.The cast members are all Brits - which makes sense as the Manor House is in England and our view of Regency England, so influenced by Jane Austin, is particularly English.This program (as it was designed for TV) is elegantly produced, with beautiful photography and very good editing of the interactions of the people living in the house. Some of them are charming, others, a bit silly, but they grow on you.The program is augmented by a nice musical score, and it is actually quite believable. It offers something we don't get from ""Pride and Prejudice"", a darker look at Regency society, the impossible restrictions (especially for women), the amazing inequality of the sexes, the incredible frustration, and the boredom that aristocrats or ""gentry"" of the period must have endured.And this is a wonderful eye opener. Austin is marvelous, as are most of the movies made from her works. Regency House Party certainly captures the spirit of her works. But it is also highly educational. I found the ""Science Week"" particularly interesting as they explored the emerging scientific discoveries of the age.Oddly, there's also a segment for horror fans, though it's nothing like the gore fests we are used to in modern cinema. Regency folk were rather interested in the macabre as well as ghosts and vampires, and the characters in this program attempt to recreate how they might have entertained themselves in this genre. Watching them put on a vampire play to entertain themselves reminded me of Mary Shelly's preface to ""Frankenstein"", wherein she explains that she wrote the book as part of a ""ghost story writing"" contest with Lord Byron and Percy Shelly. I was thinking of this during the vampire play episode when to my surprise, they ALSO referenced ""Frankenstein""!There is a visit from a period ""anatomist"" who has ""plasticized"" a number of human bodies to show the house guests (I think they actually used special props) and that segment, along with its references to Mary Shelly's novel, ""Frankenstein"", was rather creepy and a bit disturbing, but never in bad taste. I'm a fan of Shelly's novel, and this part of ""Regency House Party"" gave me a deeper realization of just how terrifying the novel must have been when it debuted in 1818.I recommend this entire program for anyone who is fascinated by the Regency period. It appeared to be historically very accurate in look, manner and tone.It is however a ""reality"" show, so a few allowances must be made for the characters who have difficulty adjusting to their new lifestyle. It must be a major psychological feat to shift from the amazing flexibility and convenience of our 21st Century society into the hierarchical and rigid world of Regency England.Talk about an attitude adjustment!There is one other thing to keep in mind while viewing this program. While it LOOKS like these people are completely immersed in the Regency period, living in a genuine manor house, wearing the costumes and all, it is important to remember that their actions are constantly being FILMED, obviously.So as audience, we do NOT see the 21st Century elements that MUST have surrounded them during the entire experience, the cameras, the producers and directors of the program. These elements are entirely invisible to us, the audience, and of course, the program WE see is probably an edit of many more hours of filming, with many experiences and events ""on the cutting room floor"".But it is a credit to everyone involved in this program that they presented such an alluring, elegant and enticing and believable vicarious Regency English experience in such a way that it really did appear that these folks were totally immersed in the Regency period.I give it 5 stars for excellence. I found it totally engrossing, compelling, fascinating, and of course romantic. Everyone did a fantastic job. Bravo.I also got a new realization of just how good life in the 21st Century is!I'd have made a terrible Mr. Darcy!Enjoy this production, it's worth it.",5,"Stunning, Engrossing and Very Romantic!",1350172800,"10 14, 2012",2012,4456,"['title', 'Regency', 'House', 'Party', 'may', 'first', 'sound', 'kind', 'frat', 'movie', 'comedy', 'fact', 'sort', 'reality', 'TV', 'series', 'produced', 'PBS', 'many', 'episodes.In', 'case', ""n't"", 'obvious', 'premise', 'similar', 'shows', 'Prairie', 'House', '1900', 'House', 'wherein', '21st', 'Century', 'people', 'live', 'time', 'completely', 'immersed', 'social', 'order', 'customs', 'Regency', 'England', 'Manor', 'house', 'complete', 'costumes', 'morals', 'manners', 'food', 'customs', 'so', 'on.The', 'cast', 'members', 'are', 'Brits', 'sense', 'Manor', 'House', 'England', 'view', 'Regency', 'England', 'so', 'influenced', 'Jane', 'Austin', 'particularly', 'English.This', 'program', 'was', 'designed', 'TV', 'elegantly', 'produced', 'beautiful', 'photography', 'very', 'good', 'editing', 'interactions', 'people', 'living', 'house', 'are', 'charming', 'others', 'bit', 'silly', 'grow', 'you.The', 'program', 'augmented', 'nice', 'musical', 'score', 'actually', 'quite', 'believable', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'darker', 'look', 'Regency', 'society', 'impossible', 'restrictions', 'especially', 'women', 'amazing', 'inequality', 'sexes', 'incredible', 'frustration', 'boredom', 'gentry', 'period', 'must', 'have', 'endured.And', 'wonderful', 'eye', 'opener', 'Austin', 'marvelous', 'are', 'most', 'movies', 'made', 'works', 'Regency', 'House', 'Party', 'certainly', 'spirit', 'works', 'also', 'highly', 'educational', 'found', 'Science', 'Week', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'explored', 'emerging', 'scientific', 'discoveries', 'age.Oddly', 'also', 'segment', 'horror', 'fans', 'nothing', 'gore', 'are', 'used', 'modern', 'cinema', 'Regency', 'folk', 'were', 'rather', 'interested', 'macabre', 'as', 'well', 'ghosts', 'vampires', 'characters', 'program', 'attempt', 'recreate', 'how', 'might', 'have', 'entertained', 'genre', 'Watching', 'put', 'vampire', 'play', 'entertain', 'reminded', 'Mary', 'Shelly', 'preface', 'Frankenstein', 'wrote', 'book', 'part', 'ghost', 'story', 'writing', 'contest', 'Lord', 'Byron', 'Percy', 'Shelly', 'was', 'thinking', 'vampire', 'play', 'episode', 'when', 'surprise', 'ALSO', 'referenced', 'Frankenstein', 'visit', 'period', 'anatomist', 'who', 'plasticized', 'number', 'human', 'bodies', 'show', 'house', 'think', 'actually', 'used', 'special', 'props', 'segment', 'references', 'Mary', 'Shelly', 'novel', 'Frankenstein', 'was', 'rather', 'creepy', 'bit', 'disturbing', 'never', 'bad', 'taste', ""'m"", 'fan', 'Shelly', 'novel', 'part', 'Regency', 'House', 'Party', 'gave', 'deeper', 'realization', 'just', 'how', 'terrifying', 'novel', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'when', 'debuted', '1818.I', 'recommend', 'entire', 'program', 'anyone', 'who', 'fascinated', 'Regency', 'period', 'appeared', 'be', 'historically', 'very', 'accurate', 'look', 'manner', 'tone.It', 'however', 'reality', 'show', 'few', 'allowances', 'must', 'be', 'made', 'characters', 'who', 'have', 'difficulty', 'adjusting', 'new', 'lifestyle', 'must', 'be', 'major', 'psychological', 'feat', 'shift', 'amazing', 'flexibility', 'convenience', '21st', 'Century', 'society', 'hierarchical', 'rigid', 'world', 'Regency', 'England.Talk', 'attitude', 'adjustment', 'one', 'other', 'thing', 'keep', 'mind', 'viewing', 'program', 'people', 'are', 'completely', 'immersed', 'Regency', 'period', 'living', 'genuine', 'manor', 'house', 'wearing', 'costumes', 'important', 'remember', 'actions', 'are', 'constantly', 'being', 'FILMED', 'obviously.So', 'audience', 'do', 'NOT', 'see', '21st', 'Century', 'elements', 'MUST', 'have', 'surrounded', 'entire', 'experience', 'cameras', 'producers', 'directors', 'program', 'elements', 'are', 'entirely', 'invisible', 'audience', 'course', 'program', 'WE', 'see', 'probably', 'edit', 'many', 'more', 'hours', 'filming', 'many', 'experiences', 'events', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', '.But', 'credit', 'everyone', 'involved', 'program', 'presented', 'alluring', 'elegant', 'enticing', 'believable', 'vicarious', 'Regency', 'English', 'experience', 'such', 'way', 'really', 'did', 'appear', 'folks', 'were', 'totally', 'immersed', 'Regency', 'period.I', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'excellence', 'found', 'totally', 'engrossing', 'compelling', 'fascinating', 'course', 'romantic', 'Everyone', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'Bravo.I', 'also', 'got', 'new', 'realization', 'just', 'how', 'good', 'life', '21st', 'Century', ""'d"", 'have', 'made', 'terrible', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'Enjoy', 'production']",Regency House Party
