13306,A1PID2MT8MMPAF,0767817656,"A. Griffiths ""Adrian""","[6, 7]","I find it very strange that some people reviewing this film have classified it as a failure, with not enough gore, no ""hot"" women and not enough Candyman on screen.First of all, ""Candyman"" easily blows away all of the Freddie, Jason and Michael Myers trash that filled cinemas in the 80's and 90's. I guess there's a type of movie-goer who likes to hero-worship the villains and gets a kick out of the evil caricatures appearing in all of those films. But ""Candyman"" is something else altogether. This story involves an inquisitive woman named Helen (Virginia Madsen -superb) who is trying to piece together the reasons behind some strange and frightening events that may or may not have something to do with an urban legend, a run down housing estate, and her own family and background. What Helen gets subjected to during this movie is a heartbreakingly cruel catalogue of horrifc violence that no living person should ever go through.I'm not exaggerating, but I'll confess that my opinion of this film is extremely high. Everything seems to work for me. Right away, the opening credits and music are wonderful, already doom-laden and menacing. The character of Helen is wonderfully believable, and the introduction of the Candyman legend is handled with just enough veracity to make you dread the (inevitable) invocation of something terrible. But the story is clever enough to mix in the danger that Helen finds herself in on the Cabrini Green apartment block estate along with the supernatural element. When she explores the empty sections of this buildng and finds a stinking derelict apartment that has long since gone rotten, the tension is racked sky-high. Even worse is to come when Helen is beaten up by thugs who are seemingly behind the Candyman-related violence being investigated. The truth is sadly far worse. And the violence, when it happens, is shockingly effective. I disagree with people who say the gore is tame in this film. Many scenes are brutally realistic and often come with the added punch of surprise.I have nothing but praise for actress Virginia Madsen who fills her part with life, making a truly great heroine - plus she's beautiful, but yet in no way exploited for her looks, her only nude scene being in the uncomfortable setting of a police examination, which is particularly heartless. The film cleverly digs out every possible way to make Helen suffer, and the viewer is carried along with her right up to the cracking ending - another shocking moment that fittingly ends a film that is full of similar scenes. If only the legend had been left at this, but the inevitable sequals were trotted out, featuring far too much of Tony Todd as the title character, who was (rightly) kept in the backround in this film - probably helping to make his portrayal so effective.Similar to Hellraiser (obviously, with the Clive Barker connection), it can be recommended to fans of that movie, but I would rate Candyman as better, as it does not dwell so much on supernatural outlandishness, and instead brings horror very much closer to everyday life. People who want more (more??) gore and topless bimbos should stick to the drive-ins - this is class, and outscares most of it's closest rivals.",5,Outstanding modern horror classic,1126742400,"09 15, 2005",2005,3220,"['find', 'very', 'strange', 'people', 'reviewing', 'film', 'have', 'classified', 'failure', 'not', 'enough', 'gore', 'hot', 'women', 'not', 'enough', 'Candyman', 'screen.First', 'Candyman', 'easily', 'away', 'Freddie', 'Jason', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'trash', 'filled', 'cinemas', '80', '90', 'guess', 'type', 'movie-goer', 'who', 'hero-worship', 'villains', 'kick', 'evil', 'caricatures', 'appearing', 'films', 'Candyman', 'something', 'else', 'altogether', 'story', 'inquisitive', 'woman', 'named', 'Helen', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', '-superb', 'who', 'trying', 'piece', 'together', 'reasons', 'strange', 'frightening', 'events', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'something', 'do', 'urban', 'legend', 'run', 'down', 'housing', 'estate', 'own', 'family', 'background', 'What', 'Helen', 'subjected', 'movie', 'heartbreakingly', 'cruel', 'catalogue', 'horrifc', 'violence', 'living', 'person', 'should', 'ever', 'go', 'through.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'exaggerating', ""'ll"", 'confess', 'opinion', 'film', 'extremely', 'high', 'Everything', 'work', 'Right', 'away', 'opening', 'credits', 'music', 'are', 'wonderful', 'already', 'doom-laden', 'menacing', 'character', 'Helen', 'wonderfully', 'believable', 'introduction', 'Candyman', 'legend', 'handled', 'just', 'enough', 'veracity', 'make', 'dread', 'inevitable', 'invocation', 'something', 'terrible', 'story', 'clever', 'enough', 'mix', 'danger', 'Helen', 'Cabrini', 'Green', 'apartment', 'block', 'estate', 'supernatural', 'element', 'When', 'empty', 'sections', 'buildng', 'stinking', 'derelict', 'apartment', 'long', 'gone', 'rotten', 'tension', 'racked', 'sky-high', 'Even', 'worse', 'come', 'when', 'Helen', 'beaten', 'up', 'thugs', 'who', 'are', 'seemingly', 'Candyman-related', 'violence', 'being', 'investigated', 'truth', 'sadly', 'far', 'worse', 'violence', 'when', 'shockingly', 'effective', 'disagree', 'people', 'who', 'say', 'gore', 'tame', 'film', 'Many', 'scenes', 'are', 'brutally', 'realistic', 'often', 'come', 'added', 'punch', 'surprise.I', 'have', 'nothing', 'praise', 'actress', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'who', 'part', 'life', 'making', 'truly', 'great', 'heroine', 'beautiful', 'yet', 'way', 'exploited', 'looks', 'only', 'nude', 'scene', 'being', 'uncomfortable', 'setting', 'police', 'examination', 'particularly', 'heartless', 'film', 'cleverly', 'out', 'possible', 'way', 'make', 'Helen', 'suffer', 'viewer', 'carried', 'right', 'up', 'cracking', 'ending', 'shocking', 'moment', 'fittingly', 'film', 'full', 'similar', 'scenes', 'only', 'legend', 'had', 'been', 'left', 'inevitable', 'sequals', 'were', 'trotted', 'out', 'featuring', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'Tony', 'Todd', 'title', 'character', 'who', 'was', 'rightly', 'kept', 'backround', 'film', 'probably', 'helping', 'make', 'portrayal', 'so', 'effective.Similar', 'Hellraiser', 'obviously', 'Clive', 'Barker', 'connection', 'can', 'be', 'recommended', 'fans', 'movie', 'would', 'rate', 'Candyman', 'better', 'not', 'dwell', 'so', 'much', 'supernatural', 'outlandishness', 'instead', 'brings', 'horror', 'very', 'much', 'closer', 'everyday', 'life', 'People', 'who', 'want', 'more', 'more', 'gore', 'topless', 'bimbos', 'should', 'stick', 'drive-ins', 'class', 'most', 'closest', 'rivals']",N/A
13307,A4KNOE8YJJUMR,0767817656,Alec McMullen,"[2, 5]","For about the first thirty-five minutes or so, this movie did a pretty good job building atmosphere and (seemingly) leading up to some serious chills. It deals with Helen, a college student and newspaper editor and the protagonist of the story, interviewing those who have information about the legend of the murderous Candyman. I couldnt wait to see where it went next.But part of the movie's problem is it hardly does go anywhere. Our first encounter with the Candyman lasts about a minute, and is a letdown. Helen sees him calling to her in a parking lot, blacks out, and wakes up in a heap of blood next to a beheaded dog and the dog's owner (whom Helen interviewed earlier) screaming that her baby has been taken. And thats where the movie starts to go downhill. There's a misguided plot twist that puts Helen in a mental institution for seeing things and acting psychotic, since she can see the Candyman but no one else can. However, it would have been much scarier if he was real and wasn't a figment of her imagination that only becomes real when he decides to kill people. There's a strange climax at a bonfire that makes little sense and is not satisfying when linked to the rest of the movie. And then theres the actual Candyman, who shows up at random times and mumbles things to Helen that make little sense.

13315,A2KIE873X00ZIT,0767817656,A. Olmo,"[3, 13]","Candyman, is shall we say not that good as a horror movie. Those of you who think this is the end all horror movie, as evidenced by many of the reviews I've read here really don't get to see many horror movies I see. As I understand it, it is based on what is popular known as these days, a Urban Myth. You say Candyman five times in front of a mirror and he's supposed to appear. One can only hope nothing is actually that easy.Candyman as explained in the movie was the son of a former slave, way back then after the Civil War I believe.  His father was a inventor and he became rich, so his son (Candyman) went to all the best schools, had all the best in education, clothing, upbring and  was brought up quite the Southern gentlemen in polite society.  He also had great skill as a artist and painter. It was this skill, that eventually led to his downfall. For it was in this regard that he was a commissioned by a weatlhy man to paint a portait of his lovely daughter. She was white and he was black in ye old good ol' South and wouldn't you know it, them two took a fancy to each other and despite all odds fell in love.BAD IDEA!!  You see in racist ol' time South, them good ol' boys, rich or not, respected his skill and tolerated him, a wealthy black man as far as they would or could. But the fact remained, he was black, she was white and when her daddy found out what was going on, let's just say he wasn't ""civil"" about it. He paid a mob to chase Candyman down through the streets, where when they caught up to him, they sawed off his hand and put a hook in the bloody stump that used to be his hand. They also smeared honey all over his body and had him attacked by a hive of bee's.  Well! there goes the facade of southern hospitality right out the window there.So ever since, he's come back as a boogeyman, mostly to the tenants of a ghetto housing project. His ""Congregation"" so to speak who keep him alive in the tales they tell in hushed whispers to each other that Candyman will get ya. This lovely young lady called Helen, who is researching her thesis on the urban myth of Candyman travels to the projects to try to uncover the truth. That too is a bad idea. Her disbelief in the Candyman legend and her efforts to try and convince the people that it was just your typical old gang bangers and crazed killers who were responsible for the recent rash of grisly killings in the projects. This for some reason arouses the real actual live Candyman into action.I mean you have to get almost to the end portion of the movie before you even get to see the Candyman himself.  That's NEVER good in ANY horror movie.  The music is AWESOME!!The score to this movie, ESPECIALLY, the main title/ending scores is probably the only thing about the movie that gets imprinted on your brain after you see it.Tony Todd is a great actor who has had a lot of parts over the years in good movies, such as ""The Rock"" with Nicohlas Cage & Sean Connery, along with Ed Harris.  He was in ""The Crow"" ofcourse with Brandon Lee.  He's been in a few Hercules & Xena episodes. Ofcourse many of you will remember he had that bit part in ""Final Destination 1 & 2"" the spooky but wise funeral director who happens to know all about death's design.  To his credit he does what he can here, but what is there to do? Slash a few people? Talk in that low, but creepy drone like voice that he has?He finally appears way too too late to have any real affect on the movie.  Most of what you see before Tony (Candyman) actually appearing is just plain filler. It makes no sense to me that it took Virgina Madsen's character to not take the stories of Candyman seriously, and her trying to discredit him and tell all those people in the projects that he didn't exist to get him to appear finally, in the flesh so to speak. He is real and he was the one who killed all those people but why would it take a so called non believer to spur him into action again?

If anything to watch for, it's Virginia Madsen's performance as Helen Lyle that makes the biggest difference in Candyman. She was strong, assertive, and very good playing the woman who appreciates and respects reality. The story is quite innovative and different, but it didn't really provide enough of suspense as I had hoped for. Tony Todd is effective as Candyman and makes the best of his limited acting ability. Bernard Rose does a great job of delivering a very above average directional effort. What I appreciate about Candyman is its intricateness of the story, and that kept me revisiting the film more than several times over the years. Although I have not seen the two sequels, I am still looking forward to them, and they probably will suck for sure. One scene I am pretty impressed with is when both Virginia Madsen and Tony Todd are covered with bees; I couldn't imagine how they did that and endured the ticklishness. There are plenty of gore scenes, especially when Candyman rips the flesh of some, using his meat hook. All in all, not exactly scary or suspenseful, Candyman is a very respectable addition to the horror genre. Due to its slowness, I am bringing the rating of Candyman down from `8' to `7'.",4,"CANDYMAN IS GONNA CARVE YOU UP, BABY!",1290816000,"11 27, 2010",2010,1337,"['Viewed', '5/03', '9/08Rate', '79/08', 'Candyman', 'slickly', 'craftily', 'made', 'horror', 'thriller', 'can', 'be', 'boring', 'times', 'anything', 'watch', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'performance', 'Helen', 'Lyle', 'biggest', 'difference', 'Candyman', 'was', 'strong', 'assertive', 'very', 'good', 'playing', 'woman', 'who', 'reality', 'story', 'quite', 'innovative', 'different', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'provide', 'enough', 'suspense', 'had', 'hoped', 'Tony', 'Todd', 'effective', 'Candyman', 'best', 'limited', 'acting', 'ability', 'Bernard', 'Rose', 'great', 'job', 'delivering', 'very', 'above', 'average', 'directional', 'effort', 'What', 'appreciate', 'Candyman', 'intricateness', 'story', 'kept', 'revisiting', 'film', 'more', 'several', 'times', 'years', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'two', 'sequels', 'am', 'still', 'looking', 'forward', 'probably', 'will', 'suck', 'sure', 'One', 'scene', 'am', 'pretty', 'impressed', 'when', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'Tony', 'Todd', 'are', 'covered', 'bees', 'could', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'how', 'did', 'endured', 'ticklishness', 'are', 'plenty', 'gore', 'scenes', 'especially', 'when', 'Candyman', 'flesh', 'using', 'meat', 'hook', 'not', 'exactly', 'scary', 'suspenseful', 'Candyman', 'very', 'respectable', 'addition', 'horror', 'genre', 'Due', 'slowness', 'am', 'bringing', 'rating', 'Candyman', '8', '7']",N/A

That is the concept of Candyman. There's more, but this is a review, not a Cliff's Notes book.Certain aspects of this film showed such promise. Candyman has an intimate and powerful desire for Helen that leads you to think that this evil being has chosen her (just a normal, pretty white girl?) for something deeper than she knows.

13318,A2582KMXLK2P06,0767817656,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Candyman is a LOT better than I remembered.  I totally forgot about all the graphic details.  I mean as far as strictly blood is concerned, this is a top of the line slash-fest of a horror movie.  The blood is *everywhere*, constantly pouring all over the floors from dead bodies (and dead dogs too!).Oh I suppose despite all this excitement I'm currently experiencing that I should mention what it's actually about, haha.  It's about a demonic entity named Candyman who only appears when you say his name in the mirror 5 times.  After the 5th time... LOOK OUT!  He'll appear and slash your body into a million little chunks!Some of these scenes are truly disturbing, such as the one in the intro with the woman being slashed to death in the bathroom (or bedroom) and in the living room floor below, her boyfriend takes a look at the ceiling and sees the blood seeping through.  Yuck!The main character is a blonde-haired woman who investigates the supposed legend that is Candyman... but we quickly discover that saying his name 5 times in a mirror because of her inability to believe in the legacy becomes more than she EVER bargained for!After a while the woman realizes that she's basically being framed by Candyman, because whenever the Candyman does a horrible deed he always manages to place the blame on the woman (or rather, the woman finds herself in a situation where she's totally defenseless) which of course leads everyone to believe the woman is crazy.  Hey she was actually sane at one point!This movie contains brilliant suspense and a perfect amount of scares and surprises.  Simply superb storytelling.  But the blood... it pours, oozes, and drips on numerous occasions, haha.The soundtrack seriously reminds me of Mike Oldfield with the spooky and melodic piano lines.  I love it.  If you like the soundtrack check out Oldfield's classic and WAY ahead of its time Tubular Bells album- it's a classic.Speaking of which, I could have SWORN during the credits there was a nursery rhyme-like melody that went something like ""Sleep baby sleep"" because I remember the chorus from a long time ago.  Oh well, perhaps I'm thinking of some other horror movie from the mid 90's.

13319,A2YAABMT80RLYA,0767817656,Ben Rowland,"[7, 9]","The slasher genre was pretty much tapped out by the early 90s when ""Candyman"" came along, and despite what would happen to the series later on (two abysmal sequels), it stands as one of the most original and terrifying horror films of the 90s.Based on the short story ""The Forbidden"" by Clive Barker (you can find it in the Books of Blood vol. 5) , it delves into urban legends and the supernatural rather than gratuitous bloodshed, though there is plenty of that here. A Chicago University researcher (Virginia Madsen), working on her thesis, decides to examine the legend of ""Candyman"", a murderous spirit said to haunt a local slum. His ghost is motivated by spite and anger, having died under violent and unjust circumstances when alive. He has a hook for a hand, and will shed innocent blood if he is called upon. The legend has it that if you look into a mirror and say his name 5 times, he will come for you. This variation of the Bloody Mary story was thought only to be an urban legend, until the researcher decides to immerse herself in the legend, only to find out that the danger is very real. The Candyman comes for her, and needless to say, blood is shed.As a villain, Candyman is more formidable than most. He is dark, sinister, and appears out of nowhere. Owing to the circumstances of his death, his hook for a hand and his penchant for honey bees (I would be giving too much away if I were to explain it) make him fearsome. Where the movie succeeds in scaring the audience is in the atmosphere. From the semi-gothic music score to the Candyman's deep and raspy voice, the viewer is on their toes from the very beginning. The horror is mainly psychological, but there are a few jump scenes that will get the heart rate up. People who like their bloodshed will enjoy some extremely gruesome murders, which are unavoidable seeing as how the villain has a hook for a hand!The Columbia DVD is as bare bones as they get, save for a theatrical trailer and the option to have either full screen or widescreen (which makes more sense than releasing two separate versions). The DVD transfer itself is quite good, with a nice fuzz-free transfer and clear picture quality. The sound is nicely pumped up, making to ominous music of the movie even more ominous. Sure, the extras are sparse, but for a budget DVD, it is to be expected.""Candyman"" is by no means a masterpiece, but it is one of the better horror films to come along in quite some time, and it could never simply be classified as a slaher movie. It is a well made psychological chiller in the similar vain to ""Hellraiser"" and countless other urban-legend based horror movies.

Bernard Rose, the visionary director behind 1988's PAPERHOUSE, paints a masterful ghost story from the writings of Clive Barker. With CANDYMAN, a new legend is born in Tony Todd. Todd first came into the genre spotlight playing the classic character of Ben in Tom Savini's NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD remake. A trained theatre actor, Todd commands the screen with his towering stature and resonating voice. He captivates us with his seductive charm, but he is also deeply terrifying. Sexy, sassy, and smart, Virginia Madsen plays a wonderful leading lady as well. She loses herself in the character of Helen, and truly falls under the Candyman's spell. The scene where Helen first encounters the Candyman in the parking garage seems out of place in the Horror genre, since it is so skillfully shot and filled with surreal beauty. Artful moments like this separate CANDYMAN from its Slasher brethren. Philip Glass lends an additional air of sophistication with his elegant score. CANDYMAN is undoubtedly one of the best Horror films to come out of the 1990's, and a classic within the genre.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",5,ILHM Reviews Candyman,1359763200,"02 2, 2013",2013,1425,"['Helen', 'completing', 'work', 'senior', 'thesis', 'disprove', 'local', 'legend', 'Candyman', 'soon', 'out', 'legends', 'are', 'born', 'blood', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'keep', 'fear', 'alive', 'Thus', 'one', 'greatest', 'Gothic', 'Horror', 'films', 'Modern', 'Age', 'CANDYMAN', 'Bernard', 'Rose', 'visionary', 'director', '1988', 'PAPERHOUSE', 'masterful', 'ghost', 'story', 'writings', 'Clive', 'Barker', 'CANDYMAN', 'new', 'legend', 'born', 'Tony', 'Todd', 'Todd', 'first', 'came', 'genre', 'spotlight', 'playing', 'classic', 'character', 'Ben', 'Tom', 'Savini', 'NIGHT', 'THE', 'LIVING', 'DEAD', 'remake', 'trained', 'theatre', 'actor', 'Todd', 'screen', 'towering', 'stature', 'resonating', 'voice', 'seductive', 'charm', 'also', 'deeply', 'terrifying', 'Sexy', 'sassy', 'smart', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'wonderful', 'leading', 'lady', 'as', 'well', 'character', 'Helen', 'truly', 'falls', 'Candyman', 'spell', 'scene', 'where', 'Helen', 'first', 'Candyman', 'parking', 'garage', 'place', 'Horror', 'genre', 'so', 'skillfully', 'shot', 'filled', 'surreal', 'beauty', 'Artful', 'moments', 'separate', 'CANDYMAN', 'Slasher', 'brethren', 'Philip', 'Glass', 'additional', 'air', 'sophistication', 'elegant', 'score', 'CANDYMAN', 'undoubtedly', 'one', 'best', 'Horror', 'films', 'come', '1990', 'classic', 'genre.-Carl', 'ManesI', 'Horror', 'Movies']",N/A

Helen Lyle is a graduate student at the University of Illinois, working on a thesis about ""Candyman,"" a legend of Chicago's Cabrini Green projects. Candyman was the son of a freed slave; his father had amassed a fortune after his release, and Candyman had grown up with all the niceties. He was a talented portrait artist, and fell in love with one of his subjects, a white subject. Her father punished Candyman by having a mob cut off his right hand and spread his body with the honey from a swarm of angry bees. Candyman was stung to death. His body was burned and the ashes spread across Cabrini Green.Today, the Candyman legend remains; a supernatural man with a hook for a hand who kills indiscriminate of age, gender, or race, fueled by the wrath that his mistreatment ignited. The people of Cabrini Green believe, writing ""Sweets to the Sweet"" in places where murders have taken place, as a kind of protection against Candyman's anger. Helen's goal is to tie the legend to real murders by real people, to show the underlying truth behind the legend.But she doesn't believe in Candyman, and that irritates him. He punishes her with a string of murders, each pointing to her as the suspect. She has two choices: be imprisoned forever in a hospital for the criminally insane, or join Candyman as his lover.

The Cabrini Green projects are an imposing structure: an immense concrete monolith covered in graffiti, dirt and trash and crawling with dangerous gangs. This is not a place for a white, upper class academic type to be spending her time and yet Helen makes the perilous journey because she is obsessed by the Candyman legend.Director Bernard Rose has a strong visual sense. He does not shoot Candyman like a traditional horror film. For example, he uses overhead shots of the city to establish several scenes-it's a powerful, God's eye view of the streets and buildings that creates an unsettling mood. This imagery is complimented by Philip Glass's experimental, elegiac score. It is never overused but instead insinuates itself into the movie, lurking in the background.The audio commentary for the movie features an impressive roster: director Bernard Rose, producer Alan Poul, Clive Barker and actors Virginia Madsen, Tony Todd and Kasi Lemmons. Each participant was recorded separately and edited together so that there is no dead air. This is a very interesting commentary packed with factoids that fans of the movie will thoroughly enjoy.""Sweets to the Sweet: The Candyman Mythos"" is a 24-minute retrospective featurette. While there is some repetition from the commentary, this is a fascinating look back at this underrated movie.""Clive Barker: Raising Hell"" takes a look the famous author and his prolific career.

It refuses to resort to irony and self-reflexivity which would dominate the rest of the decade with the rise in popularity of the Scream trilogy and its offspring, like I Know What You Did Last Summer and Urban Legends, which knowingly wink at its audience and lets them in on the joke.

13331,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,0767817656,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[5, 6]","The urban legend motif has been around for a long time now, but Clive Barker took this time-honored theme and ran with it in the form of Candyman, one of the most original, atmospheric horror films of the 1990s.  This well-made film satisfyingly captures the unique vision of Barker, blending in myth, folklore, socioeconomic stratification, fear (definitely), terror (of course), gore (buckets full), and truth to create a complex story quite unlike too many run-of-the-mill slasher films that titillate yet rarely intellectually satisfy the horror aficionado.  Helen Lyle (Virginia Madsen) is a grad student working with fellow student and friend Bernadette on a thesis built around urban legends, and once she hears the story of Candyman, she is compelled to make this particular legend the focus of the work.  According to the legend, Candyman will appear if you look into a mirror and repeat his name five times-if you believe, that is.  The residents of Cabrini-Green, a tenement house not far from Helen's home, believe; in fact, Candyman is being blamed for a very recent, particularly gruesome murder there.  Helen braves the dangers of the rough neighborhood to explore the murder scene; having discovered that her own apartment house was originally built as a tenement house just like Cabrini-Green, she knows a secret means of accessing connecting rooms, and her look around the adjacent apartment of the murder victim reveals a plethora of Candyman references and clues.  Helen's obsessive investigation of events leads her deep into Candyman's world, but when she is attacked and identifies her real-life attacker to police, the people begin to doubt the reality of Candyman.  For that reason, Candyman is compelled to appear to Helen, and he sets in motion a dramatic series of events that will assure the continued, fervent devotion of his followers.  The police blame Helen for the ensuing murders, and her options wind down to only one possible course of action at the end.  One cannot really blame Candyman for being so angry.  A talented black artist in the late 19th century, he was tortured and killed after the white woman he fell in love with became pregnant.  His hand was sawed off, and then he was covered with honey and left to die at the stingers of innumerable angry bees.  He has a hook for a hand now, and that is the weapon he uses to gut his victims.There is plenty of blood and guts in this movie; evisceration by an old rusty hook is an unavoidably messy way of dying.  I appreciated the definition and characterization of Candyman; he is both real and not real, and he philosophizes poetically on the virtue of his immortal type of being.  He lives in the fear of others, his name frightfully whispered among the members of his de facto congregation; both children and adults are terrified of him, but they believe, and that is what makes him strong.  Helen's character tended to get on my nerves at times; there is just something about her that I find annoying.  Toward the end, she comes to doubt her own sanity while struggling to accept the truth of the Candyman's unique existence in this world, but Candyman leaves no doubts as to his own existence.  The movie seems to drag a bit here and there, but the gloomy fog of unreal apprehension that rides the wave of possibility and myth into the slums never turns loose its grip on the audience.  Tony Todd is superb in the role of Candyman, filling the screen with his presence whenever he appears and seemingly floating just outside the boundaries of observation when he is absent.  If you want to watch a gore-blessed horror film that somehow manages to appeal to your intellect as well as your prurient appetites, Candyman may just be your movie.  The ending, I should note, is quite good and reflects the careful touch with which an artist performs his final brush stroke on a work of art.",5,Sweets to the sweet,1043366400,"01 24, 2003",2003,3883,"['urban', 'legend', 'motif', 'been', 'long', 'time', 'now', 'Clive', 'Barker', 'took', 'time-honored', 'theme', 'ran', 'form', 'Candyman', 'one', 'most', 'original', 'atmospheric', 'horror', 'films', '1990s', 'well-made', 'film', 'satisfyingly', 'unique', 'vision', 'Barker', 'blending', 'myth', 'folklore', 'socioeconomic', 'stratification', 'fear', 'definitely', 'terror', 'course', 'gore', 'buckets', 'full', 'truth', 'create', 'complex', 'story', 'quite', 'too', 'many', 'run-of-the-mill', 'slasher', 'films', 'titillate', 'yet', 'rarely', 'intellectually', 'satisfy', 'horror', 'aficionado', 'Helen', 'Lyle', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'grad', 'student', 'working', 'fellow', 'student', 'friend', 'Bernadette', 'thesis', 'built', 'urban', 'legends', 'once', 'story', 'Candyman', 'compelled', 'make', 'particular', 'legend', 'focus', 'work', 'According', 'legend', 'Candyman', 'will', 'appear', 'look', 'mirror', 'repeat', 'name', 'five', 'times-if', 'believe', 'residents', 'Cabrini-Green', 'tenement', 'house', 'not', 'far', 'Helen', 'home', 'believe', 'fact', 'Candyman', 'being', 'blamed', 'very', 'recent', 'particularly', 'gruesome', 'murder', 'there', 'Helen', 'dangers', 'rough', 'neighborhood', 'explore', 'murder', 'scene', 'having', 'discovered', 'own', 'apartment', 'house', 'was', 'originally', 'built', 'tenement', 'house', 'just', 'Cabrini-Green', 'secret', 'means', 'accessing', 'connecting', 'rooms', 'look', 'adjacent', 'apartment', 'murder', 'victim', 'plethora', 'Candyman', 'references', 'clues', 'Helen', 'obsessive', 'investigation', 'events', 'deep', 'Candyman', 'world', 'when', 'attacked', 'real-life', 'attacker', 'police', 'people', 'begin', 'doubt', 'reality', 'Candyman', 'reason', 'Candyman', 'compelled', 'appear', 'Helen', 'motion', 'dramatic', 'series', 'events', 'will', 'assure', 'continued', 'fervent', 'devotion', 'followers', 'police', 'blame', 'Helen', 'ensuing', 'murders', 'options', 'wind', 'down', 'only', 'one', 'possible', 'course', 'action', 'end', 'One', 'can', 'not', 'really', 'blame', 'Candyman', 'being', 'so', 'angry', 'talented', 'black', 'artist', 'late', '19th', 'century', 'was', 'tortured', 'killed', 'white', 'woman', 'fell', 'love', 'became', 'pregnant', 'hand', 'was', 'sawed', 'off', 'then', 'was', 'covered', 'honey', 'left', 'die', 'stingers', 'innumerable', 'angry', 'bees', 'hook', 'hand', 'now', 'weapon', 'gut', 'victims.There', 'plenty', 'blood', 'guts', 'movie', 'evisceration', 'old', 'rusty', 'hook', 'unavoidably', 'messy', 'way', 'dying', 'appreciated', 'definition', 'characterization', 'Candyman', 'real', 'not', 'real', 'poetically', 'virtue', 'immortal', 'type', 'being', 'fear', 'others', 'name', 'frightfully', 'whispered', 'members', 'de', 'facto', 'congregation', 'children', 'adults', 'are', 'terrified', 'believe', 'what', 'strong', 'Helen', 'character', 'tended', 'get', 'nerves', 'times', 'just', 'something', 'find', 'annoying', 'end', 'doubt', 'own', 'sanity', 'struggling', 'accept', 'truth', 'Candyman', 'unique', 'existence', 'world', 'Candyman', 'doubts', 'own', 'existence', 'movie', 'drag', 'bit', 'here', 'there', 'gloomy', 'fog', 'unreal', 'apprehension', 'wave', 'possibility', 'myth', 'slums', 'never', 'loose', 'grip', 'audience', 'Tony', 'Todd', 'superb', 'role', 'Candyman', 'filling', 'screen', 'presence', 'whenever', 'seemingly', 'floating', 'just', 'boundaries', 'observation', 'when', 'absent', 'want', 'watch', 'gore-blessed', 'horror', 'film', 'somehow', 'appeal', 'intellect', 'as', 'well', 'prurient', 'appetites', 'Candyman', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'movie', 'ending', 'should', 'note', 'quite', 'good', 'careful', 'touch', 'artist', 'final', 'brush', 'stroke', 'work', 'art']",N/A

13336,A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M,0767817656,Dr. E,"[3, 5]","Clive Barker's works frequently address issues of xenophobia. ""Nightbreed"" is an excellent example of the persecution of the ""Other."" Told from the ""Other's"" perspective, it allows its viewer a small window into the struggles of ""minorities"" (not that any film can fully convey this idea, but this is an excellent attempt at beginning a dialogue).On the surface, ""Candyman"" appears to pick-up this thread. The viewer learns that Candyman was a master portrait-artist in the late eighteenth/early nineteenth century. He was commissioned to capture the likeness of a landowner's young, innocent daughter. Instead, he captured her virginity. For this ""crime"" he was summarily covered in bees and hanged. Fast-forward to today(ish). The viewer learns that Candyman's name has become an urban-legend in Calibrini-Green (the housing-projects which were constructed on the same grounds on which he was executed). A copycat killer stalks his victims ... but is Candyman more than just a moment in history? More than just a name? Interesting premise, right?So here is where we encounter problems. The depiction of Calibrini-Green (a very real, notoriously violent housing project in Chicago) is ""white-washed."" The film does not depict the overcrowding of this area: and has encountered opposition as a result (minor stuff though, right?). Now, here is the most serious offense the film commits: this film is supposed to reveal the story of Candyman ... but inevitably, it becomes the story of Helen. She usurps the narrative ... and, thus, his power. When Helen dons the hook and ultimately replaces Candyman in the mythology (as noted in the film's conclusion), her history is being compared with his. And can we really compare the history of a white woman who lives in a condo to that of a black man who was executed without a trial? Doubtful.The film is a bit dated. It plays upon the fears white Americans had of the exodus of middle-class blacks from the ""projects"" (Calbrini-Green in this case) into suburban areas. It also plays the fears white Americans had upon the destruction of housing projects and, thus, the displacement of blacks during the Regan/Bush era. (The question being, ""Are we safe from 'these people'?"") While this could be an enlightening film, the approach is painfully flawed. The treatment of the black community is borderline insulting.Still, the film is certainly worth a watch if you are interested in the portrayal of the ""other"" in film, Clive Barker's work, or if you are simply interested in the evolution of horror film.Suggested reading: Briefel, Aviva and Sianne Nga.

13337,A1KTSCNH90LPIP,0767817656,"D. Smithee ""Universal Daddy""","[24, 28]","Candyman starts out pedestrian enough.  Helen Lyle (Virginia Madsen) is a graduate student attempting to wow her instructor while dealing with her cheating professor husband.  Helen chooses the local urban legend Candyman to blow her teacher away.  Being the detailed and dedicated researcher, she investigates the area where most of Candyman's victims are found; the Cabrini Green housing project.  Helen and her fellow student interview residents of the rundown apartment complex, explore an abandoned apartment that has been transformed into a shrine to the title character, and form an unusual bond with a young, struggling mother (Vanessa Williams).All proceeds as one would expect until a murderer using the Candyman legend as a cover is caught by the police.  Helen comforts a boy by telling him that the Candyman is not the boogeyman, just a bad man trying to scare and cause harm.  This is the turning point of the movie.By destroying the boy's belief in Candyman, Helen invites the entity who describes his state as ""to be but not to exist"".  Candyman is because others believe in him.  Helen has destroyed this so he must now revive his legend and resuscitate belief in him.  Helen encounters him in a parking garage where he commands her to ""be my victim"".  The next thing she knows, she is lying in the young mother's apartment next to her dead dog with a bloody knife in her hand.From this point Helen descends into madness with murders and a kidnapping surrounding her while her husband's cheating ways are revealed.  Eventually Candyman asks Helen to join her in the non-existence of legend.  To save a child, Helen agrees and sacrifices her life so the child might live.  The worst thing about the movie is a rather cheesy ending that confirms Helen's entry into Urban Legend-hood.Candyman is a well written thriller.  It's overabundance of gore overshadows the existential elements.  All the actors perform their parts with aplomb.  Virginia Madsen is more than believable as a woman on the edge of a breakdown, while Tony Todd was born to play the Candyman.  His tall and imposing stature combined with a deep and creepy voice can be truly unnerving at times.

13341,A312DJ13DFEU96,0767817656,"Evan Bernick ""Benny Blanco""","[22, 23]","Eventually, anyone who makes it their business to seek out quality horror movies is going to come to the conclusion that the ones that succeed in distinguishing themselves from the pack tend to fall into three distinct categories. First, you have the horror movies that are less interested in scaring you than they are seriously exploring their subject matter, and probing into the nature of evil. Sometimes, they go the supernatural route (The Exorcist, Rosemary's Baby, Don't Look Now). Sometimes, they stay grounded (Psycho, Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, Se7en). Either way, they are more disturbing than they are immediately frightening. You acknowledge that what you've seen has struck a kind of nerve, but you won't lose much sleep. These movies are  intellectually compelling but they do not provoke any immediate sense of terror.On the other hand, the second breed of quality horror movies has no interest in psychology, in the ""nature"" of their content, and do not attempt to intellectually engage you. They only want to make you feel as if you are in immediate danger. The movies that fall into this category (Halloween, Alien) do not provide food for thought, but they know how to make you uncomfortable, and they know how to push your buttons. They are manipulative in the extreme, but they are actively frightening, and provide visceral experiences that the previous category of horror films cannot.Finally, the third category of superlative horror films distinguish themselves by remaining conscious of themselves. They want to frighten you, but they also want to convince you that they are ""above"" merely pushing your buttons. At the same time, they don't want to go the intellectual route either. These films (Scream, Dawn of the Dead) are made by people who know the genre, know that the audience knows the genre, and toe a thin line between adhering to genre conventions and examining those conventions explicitly. These films are very effective, even if they are too cool for the room. You laugh knowingly, and then, bam, something truly frightening wipes that smirk right off your face.Bernard Rose's ""Candyman"" is a rarity in that it falls into all three of these categories. It is intellectually stimulating and it knows a great deal about the nature of evil, but it is also, truly, viscerally frightening. It is self-aware and yet, it is not too cool for the room, and there is no comfortable distance to be found from the nightmare that unfolds on the screen. It is as immediately frightening as the orginal Halloween, it is as thought-provoking as The Exorcist, and it is as aware as itself as the Scream trilogy. You've never seen anything quite like it before, and you probably won't see anything like it again.The plot of Candyman centers around a woman who is as much of an agnostic when it comes to the intangible world as one could imagine; she boldly pursues strides into the haunts of a malevolent spiritual force (the Cabrini Green Housing Projects in Chicago, which are dangerous enough without factoring evil spirits into the equation) in search of discovering the source of the legend of the Candyman, a man with a hook for an arm who can be summoned by repeating his name into a mirror five times. She is convinced, as any liberal pseudo-sociologist might be, that the Candyman is but a projection of the fears the urban poor have of gang/drug-related violence. The fact that there is a gang leader who has taken to calling himself the Candyman reinforces this conviction.For this woman, the idea that there is evil in the world, pure evil, unconditioned by economic/racial (most of the residents of Cabrini Green are poor and black) factors is unthinkable. She does not believe that the Candyman is anything more than an idea. She is wrong. The Candyman is real, and he doesn't much like the challenge to his authority posed by her skepticism. Furthermore, she reminds him of someone from his past whom he wishes to be reunited with, and thus he comes to view her as a conquest on more levels than one.For about half of the film, we follow the woman, played by Virginia Madsen, and her friend, played by Kasi Lemmons, as they trek through Cabrini, exchange notes, and conduct the affairs of their lives. Madsen's grad student is no different from a lot of young people. She is determined to make a mark on her field, she's a little suspicious about her husband's fidelity, she smokes, she's pretty, she's intelligent and she seems nice enough. She draws our sympathy.However, midway through the film, there is a decisive rupture, and everything in Madsen's life begins to unravel at an alarming rate. The chain of events that follow a particularly frightening scene in a parking lot take on the logic of a nightmare that one is unable to escape from. Soon, everything we have come to know about the young woman we've been following, all of the connections she has to her friends, to her husband, to humanity in general seem to be undone. It would be unfair to describe exactly what happens, but let it be said that the final fifty minutes of Candyman are as frightening as anything I've seen on film.We thought we were safe, after all. The character we'd been following had friends, family, a job, a life of her own. The possibility of coming into conflict with nothing less than pure evil was the farthest thing from her mind; she and her friend were more concerned about packing the requisite mace for their journey through the projects, more afraid of drug dealers than of demons. After all, the Candyman is an urban legend, and we know all about urban legends. They're campfire stories. There is no Boogeyman, not really.Rose plays on the self-conscious approach we take to horror films by decisively arguing that it will not save us. He engages us intellectually by toying with the idea of whether the Candyman is literally real, or only becomes literally real if enough people are afraid of him (I'll leave that up to you to decide). And he frightens us at an immediate level by pulling the rug out from under us at a crucial moment, and by never allowing us to regain our footing. It doesn't hurt that he has an uncanny eye for frightening visuals (the bees swallowing the Chicago skyline, the Candyman's self-portrait), plus the help of a terrific soundtrack from Philip Glass (whose presence reminds us that, hey, this is a serious piece of art) and compelling performances on all levels. Not to mention a great idea, and, yes, the ability to push our buttons and manipulate us when he wants to.Candyman is, as far as I'm concerned, the second most frightening film ever made; the original Halloween still remains the only movie that made me briefly fear for my own safety. But I would argue that the horror genre has produced no more complete work of art-- no other film that engages the viewer on every conceivable level they could ask to be engaged on-- than Rose's masterpiece. Halloween becomes exponentially less scary with repeated viewings, as you begin to get the sequence down and figure out what's coming. Candyman's power remains undiminished, even once you get the sequence down, because the scares give way to the ideas.Don't miss it.Rated R: Contains some very graphic gore (nothing that will  really surprise those used to the genre, but this movie does get pretty ugly by any standard-- seriously, who said this wasn't gory enough?) some language, and brief nudity (not in a sexual context).",5,"You've never seen anything quite like it before, and you probably won't see anything like it  again",1139097600,"02 5, 2006",2006,7462,"['Eventually', 'anyone', 'who', 'business',

This legend becomes then an urban tale and the rejected populations in the projects of Chicago have to assume his coming if you call his name five times in front of a mirror, and to assume their mission is to help in the passing of the candyman's fate onto the next candyman who in fact will be a candywoman. The film is terryfing in many ways, very well done and its mythical and folkloric logic is absolutely unevadable. This mythical and folkloric dimension makes this thriller a lot more powerful  than a simple thriller like Seven for instance, because there is a mental level, a level of necessary belief in myths, a level that is never absent in man's consciousness, in the consciousness and culture of any man or woman, either simple uneducated people who believe out of superstition, or educated people who believe because they know myths are an organizing and energizing force in humanity and will always be.

More of a thriller than a stright horror movie, Virginia Madsen starts as Helen Lyle, a grad student at the University of Illinois at Chicago.  She, and her friend, are writing a thesis on modern folklore.  One story she is researching is of the ""Candyman"", a slave spirit with a hook hand who is said to haunt Chicago's notorious Cabrini-Green housing projects.Upon hearing of a recent death at Cabrini-Green attributed to the Candyman, she wants to add a new chapter to her research.  Helen investigates and interviews the witnesses who found the dead person and the circumstances which led to the murder.  All agree- the Candyman did it.Helen assumes that the people in the projects are simply buying into the urban legend of the Candyman and that there must be a rational explanation for the death.  However, her doubt in the existence of the Candyman only provokes his anger to prove to her that he is indeed real, and not a figment of imagination.The Candyman starts paying personal visits to Helen, and, under his demonic spell, new deaths occur all around her.  She gets framed for those deaths and escapes a mental hospital to prove her innocence, and to save a child that the Candyman abducted from the projects.Nice performances by Virginia Madsen and Tony Todd, along with the music by Philip Glass make this an effective thriller, a modern day ghost story, and a tragic tale of obsessed love.",4,gothic thriller from 1992.,1286582400,"10 9, 2010",2010,1478,"['film', 'based', 'story', 'written', 'British', 'writer', 'Clive', 'Barker', 'More', 'thriller', 'stright', 'horror', 'movie', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'Helen', 'Lyle', 'grad', 'student', 'University', 'Illinois', 'Chicago', 'friend', 'are', 'writing', 'thesis', 'modern', 'folklore', 'One', 'story', 'researching', 'Candyman', 'slave', 'spirit', 'hook', 'hand', 'who', 'said', 'haunt', 'Chicago', 'notorious', 'Cabrini-Green', 'housing', 'projects.Upon', 'hearing', 'recent', 'death', 'Cabrini-Green', 'attributed', 'Candyman', 'add', 'new', 'chapter', 'research', 'Helen', 'investigates', 'witnesses', 'who', 'found', 'dead', 'person', 'circumstances', 'led', 'murder', 'agree-', 'Candyman', 'did', 'it.Helen', 'assumes', 'people', 'projects', 'are', 'simply', 'buying', 'urban', 'legend', 'Candyman', 'must', 'be', 'rational', 'explanation', 'death', 'However', 'doubt', 'existence', 'Candyman', 'only', 'anger', 'prove', 'indeed', 'real', 'not', 'figment', 'imagination.The', 'Candyman', 'paying', 'personal', 'visits', 'Helen', 'demonic', 'spell', 'new', 'deaths', 'occur', 'framed', 'deaths', 'mental', 'hospital', 'prove', 'innocence', 'save', 'child', 'Candyman', 'abducted', 'projects.Nice', 'performances', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'Tony', 'Todd', 'music', 'Philip', 'Glass', 'make', 'effective', 'thriller', 'modern', 'day', 'ghost', 'story', 'tragic', 'tale', 'obsessed', 'love']",N/A

This is perfectly exhibited in the film Candyman, where the overall tone is uncompromisingly unsettling. Through the first act of the film it manages to arouse this sensation without getting excessively visually graphic. It thrives somewhat on the Hitchcockian factor of merely using the idea of the Candyman, recounted through stories, to build up a fear of the character.The Candyman is a powerful urban horror myth that in the film is a hushed whisper around the government housing projects in the Southside of Chicago. If Tony Todd isn't ever known for anything else other than his portrayal of the titular character here, he will have established himself in horror film history forever.

When I saw that Tony Todd was the main character in the movie, I knew I had to give it a watch since he is perhaps America's top known African American man for having numerous roles in horror movies.The movie begins with graduate student, Helen Lyle doing a research thesis on urban myths to impress her sly husband and professor, Trevor. While interviewing freshmen about their superstitions, she hears about a local legend known as Candyman. The legend claims that Candyman can be summoned by saying his name five times while facing a mirror (similar to the Bloody Mary folkloric tale), whereupon he will murder the summoner with his hook-hand. Later that evening, Helen and her friend Bernadette jokingly call Candyman's name into the mirror in Helen's bathroom but nothing happens.Helen goes on to discover that Candyman was the son of a slave in the 1890s by the name of Daniel Robitaille who grew up in a polite society as a well-known artist. After falling in love with a white woman and impregnating her, his girlfriend's father sent a lynch mob out to attack the Daniel, who sawed off his right painter's hand with a rusty blade. They went on to smash a beehive and smear the honeycomb over his wound and naked body before the bees came and stung him to death. As he died, the mob referred to him as ""Candyman"" which is where the name came about.Helen and her assistant head to Cabrini Green, the housing project where Candyman's ashes were scattered as well as many of Candyman's victims have been found. After Helen claims Candyman isn't real, she supposedly brings him forth and has a confrontation with him in a parking garage claiming that her disbelief in him, ruined the faith of his congregation in hell; therefore she must ""be his victim"" so she may too become immortal and have her own legacy as well as prove to her that he is a reality.From there on in, Helen goes on a very unfortunate downward spiral. Framed for murders and the kidnapping of a baby, all committed by Candyman, Helen descends into her own hell. It gets even worse when she discovers that her husband has been cheating on her with another student.Overall, Candyman is a great horror movie to come out of the 90s. The plot is great, character development is great, and most of all there's a switch up with an African American portraying the villain rather than the ordinary psycho white guy. The ending is a bit too typical but if you can look past that, you're in for a treat with Candyman",5,Anyone Who Can Appreciate Old School Horror Movies Will Love Candyman,1371513600,"06 18, 2013",2013,2572,"['Came', 'movie', 'FearNet', 'decided', 'give', 'watch', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'When', 'saw', 'Tony', 'Todd', 'was', 'main', 'character', 'movie', 'knew', 'had', 'give', 'watch', 'perhaps', 'America', 'top', 'known', 'African', 'American', 'man', 'having', 'numerous', 'roles', 'horror', 'movies.The', 'movie', 'graduate', 'student', 'Helen', 'Lyle', 'doing', 'research', 'thesis', 'urban', 'myths', 'impress', 'sly', 'husband', 'professor', 'Trevor', 'interviewing', 'freshmen', 'superstitions', 'local', 'legend', 'known', 'Candyman', 'legend', 'Candyman', 'can', 'be', 'summoned', 'saying', 'name', 'five', 'times', 'facing', 'mirror', 'similar', 'Bloody', 'Mary', 'folkloric', 'tale', 'will', 'murder', 'summoner', 'hook-hand', 'Later', 'evening', 'Helen', 'friend', 'Bernadette', 'jokingly', 'call', 'Candyman', 'name', 'mirror', 'Helen', 'bathroom', 'nothing', 'happens.Helen', 'discover', 'Candyman', 'was', 'son', 'slave', '1890s', 'name', 'Daniel', 'Robitaille', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'polite', 'society', 'well-known', 'artist', 'falling', 'love', 'white', 'woman', 'impregnating', 'girlfriend', 'father', 'sent', 'lynch', 'mob', 'attack', 'Daniel', 'who', 'sawed', 'off', 'right', 'painter', 'hand', 'rusty', 'blade', 'went', 'smash', 'beehive', 'smear', 'honeycomb', 'wound', 'naked', 'body', 'bees', 'came', 'stung', 'death', 'died', 'mob', 'referred', 'Candyman', 'where', 'name', 'came', 'about.Helen', 'assistant', 'head', 'Cabrini', 'Green', 'housing', 'project', 'where', 'Candyman', 'ashes', 'were', 'scattered', 'as', 'well', 'many', 'Candyman', 'victims', 'have', 'been', 'found', 'Helen', 'claims', 'Candyman', ""n't"", 'real', 'supposedly', 'forth', 'confrontation', 'parking', 'garage', 'claiming', 'disbelief', 'ruined', 'faith', 'congregation', 'hell', 'must', 'be', 'victim', 'may', 'too', 'become', 'immortal', 'have', 'own', 'legacy', 'as', 'well', 'prove', 'reality.From', 'there', 'Helen', 'very', 'unfortunate', 'downward', 'spiral', 'Framed', 'murders', 'kidnapping', 'baby', 'committed', 'Candyman', 'Helen', 'own', 'hell', 'even', 'worse', 'when', 'husband', 'been', 'cheating', 'student.Overall', 'Candyman', 'great', 'horror', 'movie', 'come', '90s', 'plot', 'great', 'character', 'development', 'great', 'most', 'switch', 'up', 'African', 'American', 'portraying', 'villain', 'rather', 'ordinary', 'psycho', 'white', 'guy', 'ending', 'bit', 'too', 'typical', 'can', 'look', ""'re"", 'treat', 'Candyman']",N/A

While interviewing freshmen about their superstitions, she hears about a local legend known as Candyman. The legend contains many thematic elements similar to the most well known urban legends, including endangered babysitters, spirits who appear in mirrors when fatally summoned, and maniac killers with unnatural deformities. The legend states that while Candyman was the son of a slave, he nevertheless became a well known artist. Yet, after falling in love with a white woman who becomes pregnant, Candyman is chased through the plantation and when caught, has his drawing hand cut off and replaced with a hook. He is then smeared with honey (prompting the locals to chant `Candyman' a total of 5 times- hence the `say his name 5 times into the mirror'), stolen from a nearby apiary, and the bees sting him to death. The legend also claims that Candyman is summoned by anyone who looks into a mirror and chants his name five times (similar to the Bloody Mary folkloric tale). Summoning him often costs the individual their own life. Later that evening, Helen and her friend Bernadette jokingly call Candyman's name into the mirror in Helen's bathroom but nothing happens.While conducting her research, Helen enters the notorious gang-ridden Cabrini-Green housing project, the site of a recent unsolved murder. There she meets Anne-Marie McCoy, one of the residents, as well as a young boy named Jake, who tells her a disturbing story of a child who was horribly mutilated in a public restroom near the projects, supposedly by Candyman. While exploring the run-down restroom, Helen is attacked by a gang member carrying a hook who has taken the Candyman moniker as his own to enhance his own street credibility by associating himself with the legend. Helen survives the assault and is able to later identify her attacker to the police.Helen later returns to school but hears a voice calling her name as she walks through a parking garage. Another man she encounters states he is the Candyman of the urban legend and because of Helen's disbelief in him, he must now prove to her that he is real. Helen blacks out and wakes up in Anne-Marie's apartment, covered in blood. Anne-Marie, whose Rottweiler has been decapitated and whose baby is also missing, attacks Helen and she is forced to defend herself from Anne-Marie using a meat cleaver. The police then enter the apartment and arrest Helen. Is Helen going crazy or will Candyman come for her next?Three words adequately describe ""Candyman"": Scary. As. Hell. I was twelve years old when I saw the movie for the first time and it hasn't left my mind since. From the haunting Phillip Glass score to the uncompromising promises by both Tony Todd as Candyman and Virginia Madsen (who has never looked better) as Helen, everything about this movie is sensationally scary. Madsen, in particular, seems to relish playing against time and causes the audience to be sympathetic with her character when a lesser actress would have just come across as annoying.

13364,A3013MHSQS4Y8Y,0767817656,lobohombreriera,"[4, 4]","Although it's practically unknown outside the English-speaking audience, ""Candyman"" is considered one of the finest horror movies of the nineties. The reason? The absolute purity of it. It haunts the spectator using the brutal story of a folk tale and throws an amazing conclusion: horror can be real, as long as you believe in it.Based on the literary work of Clive Barker, ""Candyman"" explores the myth of a supernatural murderer that haunts the lower-class housing project Cabrini Green. A graduate student called Helen is doing her thesis on urban folk, and ends up knee-deep in the tale of the terrible Candyman, who is said to appear to those who say his name five times in front of a mirror. In an act of arrogant disbelief, Helen summons the ghost as if it was merely a joke. There will be no laughter when she realizes that Candyman is not only real, but is also after her!Director Bernard Rose gave the movie a very plain, middle-class point-of-view, which was definitely the right way to go. One is struck immediately by the difference between the neat cleanliness of Helen's condo and Cabrini Green's maze-like darkness. In this atmosphere of absolute realism, the presence of Candyman is like a deep voice from the Other Side, a trap that lures Helen into the claws of horror and insanity, where no one can help her, either because they are afraid of Candyman or because they don't even believe in his existence. Through all the movie, the subjects of belief and disbelief become the main issues, right up to its incredible ending, which of course I won't spoil for you.This DVD edition, however, should have included more special features. It barely has the theatrical trailer, and it lacks other stuff that would have made it more interesting, like some commentaries by the stars and director. The technical quality is more than good, specially the sound, which allows you to really appreciate the music, the movie's strongpoint.In a word, if you're a horror fan don't hesitate in getting this cult classic. Candyman really is prime-quality stuff. It'll scare you because of its profound sense of reality, and I can assure you that you'll love it, as long as you stay away from the cheesy sequels, none of them deserve to mentioned here.",4,"A deep, hard-core, underrated horror classic.",1021248000,"05 13, 2002",2002,2251,"['practically', 'unknown', 'English-speaking', 'audience', 'Candyman', 'considered', 'one', 'finest', 'horror', 'movies', 'nineties', 'reason', 'absolute', 'purity', 'spectator', 'using', 'brutal', 'story', 'folk', 'tale', 'amazing', 'conclusion', 'horror', 'can', 'be', 'real', 'as', 'long', 'believe', 'it.Based', 'literary', 'work', 'Clive', 'Barker', 'Candyman', 'myth', 'supernatural', 'murderer', 'lower-class', 'housing', 'project', 'Cabrini', 'Green', 'A', 'graduate', 'student', 'called', 'Helen', 'doing', 'thesis', 'urban', 'folk', 'up', 'knee-deep', 'tale', 'terrible', 'Candyman', 'who', 'said', 'appear', 'who', 'say', 'name', 'five', 'times', 'front', 'mirror', 'act', 'arrogant', 'disbelief', 'Helen', 'ghost', 'was', 'merely', 'joke', 'will', 'be', 'no', 'laughter', 'when', 'Candyman', 'not', 'only', 'real', 'also', 'Director', 'Bernard', 'Rose', 'gave', 'movie', 'very', 'plain', 'middle-class', 'point-of-view', 'was', 'definitely', 'right', 'way', 'go', 'One', 'struck', 'immediately', 'difference', 'neat', 'cleanliness', 'Helen', 'condo', 'Cabrini', 'Green', 'maze-like', 'darkness', 'atmosphere', 'absolute', 'realism', 'presence', 'Candyman', 'deep', 'voice', 'Other', 'Side', 'trap', 'Helen', 'claws', 'horror', 'insanity', 'where', 'one', 'can', 'help', 'either', 'are', 'afraid', 'Candyman', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'believe', 'existence', 'movie', 'subjects', 'belief', 'disbelief', 'become', 'main', 'issues', 'right', 'up', 'incredible', 'ending', 'course', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'you.This', 'DVD', 'edition', 'however', 'should', 'have', 'included', 'more', 'special', 'features', 'barely', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'other', 'stuff', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'interesting', 'commentaries', 'stars', 'director', 'technical', 'quality', 'more', 'good', 'specially', 'sound', 'really', 'appreciate', 'music', 'movie', 'strongpoint.In', 'word', ""'re"", 'horror', 'fan', 'do', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'getting', 'cult', 'classic', 'Candyman', 'really', 'prime-quality', 'stuff', ""'ll"", 'scare', 'profound', 'sense', 'reality', 'can', 'assure', ""'ll"", 'love', 'as', 'long', 'stay', 'away', 'cheesy', 'sequels', 'none', 'deserve', 'mentioned', 'here']",N/A

My familiarity with those housing projects is what made ""Candyman"" more than just a movie to me. This movie not only had a unique story line, but by movie's end you are not one hundred percent sure if Candyman committed the murders of if Virginia Madsen's character did. This ambiguity, this vagueness is what lends realism to a movie that I consider to be the best of the genre. Tony Todd, a long-time underestimated actor, gives a sterling performance as the baritone voiced ""creature."" Testimony to the movies greatness can be evidenced by the lack of long, drawn out dialogue on Candyman's part: ""Be my victim,"" ""come to me"" and other short, blood curdling statements sufficed. An important note: this movie's premise is that Candyman, as a young artist, fell in love with a white girl, the daughter of a wealthy plantation owner. The plantation owner would have none of that, and sent henchmen to murder the young man. As part of the torture, they not only cut off the hand that he sketched his pictures with, but they also brought in bees that stung him until he hwas dead.

13382,AJUEE2C2EJ0V3,0767817656,Paperbackstash,"[1, 1]","A magical woven tale that sits deep in the heart and tugs on the brain stem.This tale of eeriness and urban legends unfolds with Helen, a journalist trying to discredit the tale of Candyman, the ghostly villian who has survived the times by feeding off the fear of others as part of a mythical, urban legend. From the gifted director Bernard Rose and the ingenious mind of Clive Barker's short story The Forbidden.The first half focuses on superb buildup and mood to introduce us to the characters and get us into the actual story. Besides the very beginning we don't see Candyman the first half and are left to wonder what is real and what's not. Rose uses the directional technique of showing flashbacks and scenes/shots from Candyman's' lair and such to make it appear he's everywhere while his screen time isn't really that long. The scene where we see Candyman for the first time for real is amazing. Tony Todd was ideal for the role -- he is powerful and built well; his voice is amplified to sound even deeper and surreal.Basically Candyman is a haunting love tale. When Helen won't return his affection he basically tries to frame her for murder and ruins her life from rage of sorts. The very ending let me down as sort of a cheesy type cop-out. That's the only thing I disliked.The film also explores a lot into society's dilemmas. The legend of Candyman is kept alive by people who have nothing else to believe in and whom no one else will believe. Separated from the rest of the world Cabrini Greens legend of Candyman is formed and kept alive through fear. If he does not remain feared, he vanishes, and this is what Candyman tries to avoid. Not a clear cut evil guy, Candyman is in a way forced to slaughter for survival purposes. Helen is going out of her way to investigate myth and trying to show that Candyman himself is a made up delusion and the works of something smaller at play. When she does this, after freeing him from his mirror domain earlier in the picture, he is forced to come reprove himself.As Helen is hypnotized, we are. Some of the scenes shot are sort of dreamy; other times it has this raw and powerful edge. Some jump moments here and there, small chase scenes not really long. Sometimes for anticipation, other times for shocked awe, transfixed on the images through the screen. Many times people don't get this movie completely the first time around.They wished to shoot Candyman as realistic as possible so that it will age well and won't ever lose the edge even if you watch it repeatably or years later when better computer graphics are out.Bernard Rose also did Paperhouse. This is his third film. Makeup artist was Bob Keen. George Lucas helped with the voice. Music was Phillip (Koyaanisqatsi) Glass. Clive Barker stayed aboard as executive producer.Bottom line: This film is art.

'Candyman', the original urban-legend-based horror movie is definitely one of the absolute best horror movies of the 90's, and even today, with a decent body of work being produced in this genre, stands the test of time as a truly scary and original picture.Attractive, intelligent and wry university researcher Helen Lyle (an excellent, hitherto overlooked Virginia Madsen) stumbles onto the horrifying legacy of The Candyman, while compiling a research paper on Urban Legend. She and her friend Bernadette (Kasi Lemmons) investigate further, and what ensues is a genuinely disturbing movie, choc-full of decent performances, excellent direction and an exquisite score by Phillip Glass.The premise is simple: Urban Legend comes to life, starts rampage, must be stopped. It's the actors that make 'Candyman' a treat, and Madsen and Lemmons give great performances, believable as disaster-plagued Women-Of-The-Ninties. Madsen, in particular, does a brilliant job in the role of the hapless Helen, being by turns businesslike and frail. Tony Todd as the titular Candyman is one of the most memorable villains of modern Horror, and gives a sensual, menacing performance as the Villain. His voice and screen presence make the flesh crawl, while simultaneously exuding charisma.Bernard Rose's direction (he also wrote the screenplay, from an old Clive Barker story) is standard-setting. The grim, gritty vistas of Cabrini Green and the sepia-toned flashback sequences are memorable and chilling, and spiralling arial shots coupled with choppy cut-sequences make for a visual feast. The score, too, helps the picture enormously, and Glass' solo piano is the stuff of horror classics.An original and excellent horror, 'Candyman' deserves its place as a true classic of the Genre. Neither pretentious nor ironic, it's a brilliantly realised vision of a modern nightmare.

13390,AIVW1JAT9T44,0767817656,"Rustin Parr ""Rustin Parr""","[5, 6]","Directed by Bernard Rose, based on a Clive Barker's short story called ""The Forbidden"", ""Candyman"" is unlike what I've seen before. It's a mixture of psychological and downplayed bloodfest that manages to make you think and scream at the same time. It's a thinking man's horror movie, if you will.Helen Lyle (Virginia Madsen) is a graduate research student, undergoing an assignment on urban legends, particularly of Candyman, a titular mythic figure with a hook on his bloody stump of a right hand that haunts a ramshackle Cabrini-Green housing project in Chicago. After interviewing dozens of people and going through a grave assault by a gang, Lyle stubbornly still doesn't believe in Candyman. As oppose to taking the gravity of the people's beliefs seriously, to Lyle, Candyman is still nothing but an urban legend created to frighten the kids to go back to sleep and keep away trespassers from the notorious Cabrini-Green residential area. All is just a thesis until the day Candyman appears to her, haunting her first with his enigmatic, gravel sounding voice and later, murdering the people around her. As a result, Helen is arrested and is committed to a mental institution even though she doesn't really commit the murders (or does she?!?) simply because like all police in every horror movie, they don't believe in monsters and supernatural killers, let alone in urban legends.A side story involves Helen Lyle's husband who abandons her halfway through for his sanity but mostly for a young ditzy girl from his University class he teaches in. Sounds like a pulpy soap operaish technique to make us sympathize with the heroine but man, could it work even more genuinely. Helen's plight at the end is just as sincerely heartbreaking and painful as any other non-horror tragic movies out there, offering a tranquility in poignancy: a quality very rare in this type of genre. This is where the movie really works because, unlike its sequels and clones and other mundane, generic slasher variety, it's refreshing to have someone who we can care and root for. Even without this aforementioned quality, the subplot still has to exist, because in the context of the film, it shows that Lyle's normal life is never the same again once Candyman's wrath is unleashed upon her.The intelligence of the script is just as strong as its ambiguity. Mainly, the psychological aspect of it plays around the notion of one's individualism going over the sea of insanity and hallucinations. Does Candyman really exists? Is so, is Helen the reincarnation of Candyman's lost love? If he's just a myth; nothing more, nothing less, how one can define Helen? Innocent or have finally given up to her craziness of her urban legend obsessions? A few questions out of a lot that are left unanswered and to be pondered to the audiences thinking brain. It can also be seen as a satire of shallow mass consumption, formulating ideas through the analogy of the ever-increasing popularity of urban legends in this kind of protocol: people believing in Candyman: safe and alive; Helen not believing in Candyman: crazy and a scapegoat.Only ""The Blair Witch Project"", ""Scream"" and ""Wes Craven's New Nightmare"" in the late 90's come close to this level of sophistication of setting up the mystery and ambiguity to be analyzed that ""Candyman"" laid out.Of course, it also satisfies the gorehounds of all of us. Scenes of bloodshed and gore-letting are few and between, but once they come, they come unleashing a violent and unrestrained look at the torture done to the victim. Some scenes are nauseating, disturbing and just plain nasty.The actors are great, particularly the underrated Virginia Madsen (Michael Madsen's sister), who exhibits great vulnerability through her occasional tough and determined strong-willed individual. Tony Todd is very effective and enigmatic as Candyman himself. He holds our attention even if we want to look away. Terrifying voice too!""Candyman"" also introduced me to the minimalist maestro himself, Philip Glass. Before ""Candyman"", I didn't know such a talented musical composer exist until the music during its opening credits bombarded me with its simple and repeating vocalized concerto. It sounded bizarre, something I've never heard of before, and harsh to the ears; but I believed that somehow because of those qualities, it was beautiful and powerful on its own twisted way, like a deformed but equally lovable version of Beethoven.""Candyman"" is a psychological mind game that blurs the lines between fantasy and reality, refusing us to have the answers whether the things that happened are actual fact. To disservice the movie, it is a kid's version of ""Mulholland Drive"" and ""Memento"" with a dash of ""Friday the 13th"" as it does falters along the way, especially at the end, where it turned into a full-on, generic, slasher mode, dampening the powerfully moving scene of Helen Lyle's funeral at the gravesite, where I feel that the movie should have ended.Nevertheless, one of the best horror films out there; genuinely scary, heavy with atmosphere, laden with good performances, a deafening and dizzening but equally amazing score and a very intelligent script all equals to saying his name five times in the mirror!Candyman....",5,"He is the writing on the wall, the whisper in the classroom!",1095984000,"09 24, 2004",2004,5244,"['Directed', 'Bernard', 'Rose', 'based', 'Clive', 'Barker',

Helen Lyle is a writer working on a story about the Candyman, an urban legend in which if you say the name Candyman into the mirror five times, the Candyman comes to get you. So Helen goes about to prove that the urban legend isnt true and says Candyman five times in the mirror. Soon she is being stalked by the Candyman and she will live to regret her actions. Both Helen (played by Virgina Madsen I think?) and the Candyman (Tony Todd) are portrayed superbly.

Candyman was released in 1992 and was dubbed by many as a top-notch horror flick. The 1990's was the golden age of horror, at least in Sid's slightly unorthadox view. This is a perfect example of what's wrong with the film industry. This certified snoozer gets the nod as a worthwhile flick while true 90's classics likeWicked GamesandDeath Ring(aka The Greatest Movie of All-Time) go overlooked. But we decided to go with this one based on the fact that it got so much hype when it came out.Basically, the Candyman can be summoned by reciting his name 5 times in the mirror. And once the juice is loose, he will only harm you if you don't believe in his meat hooking powers. So it lends itself to logic that if you believe in the Candyman, you know what saying his name 5 times will bring; Sid's guess is that you just take a pass on chanting ""Candyman"" and keep living a normal life. But not our main character. Nope, she risks her life and those around her to write an awesome thesis on urban legends. Why couldn't this girl just do some research to write her thesis? That's the one question that can unravel this ridiculous plot.Sid could not find one good thing about this movie. It was plodding, boring, shallow and pedantic. It definitely IS NOT a flick that we would have enjoyed in the good old days. It even gets this lowly distiction: when we turned this piece off from on demand we yelled ""He's gone!

Really I think fear (or terror), shock, horror, and that subtler, more-lingering feeling we call 'disturbing' are related but seperate senastions, and while many scary movies mix them in in different amounts, in ""Candyman"" the emphasis is definately on the Horror (though shock is certainly present too; see the film's last ten minutes - one of the few unexpected finales not ruined by too many people giving it away one day after it hits theaters)  (On a slightly digressive note, there are also quite a few movies in the horror section that, despite ranking relatively low in areas of actual horror or fear, still excel massively while maintaining their identities as horror films, drawing on spookiness, thrills, fun, awe, or whatever - ""Night Of The Demons"" and ""Cutting Class"" are 2 prime examples)""Candyman"" is about a graduate student (excellently played by Virginia Madsen) doing her doctoral thesis on urban legends, in particular the ""Candyman"", a mythological figure said to appear when someone says his name in the mirror 5 times and, with his hook hand, split the victim - how does that go? - 'from groin to gullett'.  Hoping both to explore the roots of how such legends get started and to debunk the legend herself, Helen (the Madsen character) ends up getting a lot more than she bargained for.

University researcher Helen Lyle (Virginia Madsen) is investigating urban legends and finds that one of them might have a basis in reality.  Numerous leads draw her to the Chicago's infamous Cabrini-Green housing complex where residents speak of a supernatural killer who appears when his victims say his name five times in front of a mirror, then disembowels them.  Is it a myth?  Is the Candyman some kind of serial killer associated with the drug trade?  Or is he something supernatural after all?  It's a great setup and the early scenes are handled masterfully, establishing the requisite tension and an engaging subtext about sexual double-standards, marital infidelity, and yuppie race anxiety - Helen discovers that her own apartment block was built as a housing project but then converted to condos when social planners realized it was too close to the white folk's suburbs.  Unfortunately, the movie goes off the rails almost immediately after the Candyman himself appears.  Helen is confronted in a parking station by a mysterious black man then wakes up in a blood-soaked apartment back at Cabrini-Green.  She is accused of kidnapping a baby and things go from bad to worse for Helen - and for the audience - as the story lumbers from one violent confrontation to another.  Is the Candyman really a supernatural force of evil empowered by those who believe in his legend, or is he a manifestation of the victim's own tortured conscience?

The Candyman is a unique thriller/suspense/psychological horror film created by Clive Barker. It is about urban legends and the implications they can have on real life.  Virgina Madsen plays the role of a determined & out going graduate student named Helen. She bravely delves deep into the notorious Chicago Cabrini-Green housing project to research the legend of the murderous Candyman. The legend states that Candyman was the son of a slave that was murdered for his involvement with a women in 1855. It was believed that his jealous murderers chopped his hand off and covered him with bees.  The Candyman returns for revenge every time a person says his name in the mirror five times. Throughout the film Helen learns more and more about this twisted myth. The further the research the further the madness. Is Candyman real or is Helen totally insane? Who is committing the murders? What drives people to commit violent acts? The answers to these questions are essentially left of up to the viewer. This is a very well done horror film with strong ties to the real world.

Attempting to both get out of jail and save those who are close to her, she is on a relentless path that she not only hopes will lead to her survival, but the truth of the Candyman.Excellent script is one of the better adaptations of a Clive Barker story.  Madsen gives a fine performance in the leading role and Tony Todd is hauntingly fresh as the tormenting hooked murderer.  Will keep the audience on the edge of their seats throughout the entire film, only to have their entire bodies lifted out in shock with a superb climax.

I generally like Clive Barker's writing, but so many of his stories just don't translate well to film. I've never read the original story on this one, but I want to now. This was, simply put, wonderful.The plot follows a woman studying urban legends. One of which is the Candyman. Supposedly if you say his name five times into a mirror, he'll come for you. Her investigation of the Candyman points to some grain of truth and she helps the police track down a real human culprit going by the name... but that doesn't stop the legend.The story is effective and I love the examination of urban legends and how belief is what keeps them going. The acting is good and the scares are pretty good too. The best part though is the score. Seriously, this has one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard in a horror movie.

It wasn't long after Candyman that Scream came out, revitalizing the genre, but also diluting it of the actual &quot;horror&quot;.Candyman plays upon the Bloody Mary urban legend.  If you look in a mirror and say &quot;Candyman&quot; several times, the real Candyman will appear behind you and gut you.  Of course idiots are bound to do it.  Then again the characters don't realize they are in a horror film.  Virginia Madsen plays a woman doing a thesis on urban legends and becomes fascinated in the Candyman legend.  Her research leads her to Cabrini-Green, one of the roughest neighborhoods in Chicago.  There, a Candyman murder was supposed to have occurred.  Unfortunately for her, her poking around draws the attention of the other-worldly Candyman and he teaches her a lesson about inspiring fear in others.A Clive Barker creation, Candyman is grim, very grim.  It leaves you at times wondering &quot;How will she ever get out of this?&quot;  Well, who says she will?  The Candyman (played by Tony Todd who portrayed Worf's brother on Star Trek:TNG) weilds a hook jammed into the stump of his bloody wrist and embodies all the nastiness hinted at by the better urban legends.  Someone you can't get away from and isn't restrained by the laws of the physical world.  Run away from him, keep running, and an hour later when you stop to catch your breath, there is Candyman just standing there.  Lock your door and turn around, and there he is.  Heck, even Jason Vorhees has to take the time to bash in the door.The Candyman DVD only offers trailers, but does have both full screen and widescreen on one disk, but that's about it.  It would have been nice to hear Todd and Madsen talk about the experience of making the film.  Hopefully we will see a special edition in the next year or so.

Virginia Madsen is pretty good as Helen-the classic skeptic who discovers the truth the hard way, while her husband is played by Xander Berkeley, another snobby charecter, remember Air Force One?Even though I gave this film 5 stars, I do have a couple issues with it-primarily the skeptically stupid police force, Helen changes her tune from skeptic to believer rather quickly, too bad the police aren't that smart, but as the saying goes ""seeing is believing."" The other issue is the animal and child cruelty.  However, I'm grateful that the cruelty was implied and quick.Director/Writer Bernard Rose hit all the right moves, with a frightning surprise around every corner, plus Phillip Glass does an eerily effective musical score, Clive Barker had some influence on the film as executive producer, and even though I haven't seen the H.Raiser films, and honestly don't want to for personal reasons, you can tell.I know it's just a movie, but it scared me enough not to tempt the fates.",5,This film freaks me out even now!,1288310400,"10 29, 2010",2010,1159,"['first', 'time', 'saw', 'movie', '15', 'yo', ""'m"", '30', 'now', 'really', 'creeped', 'have', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'saying', 'was', 'role', 'Tony', 'Todd', 'was', 'born', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'pretty', 'good', 'Helen-the', 'classic', 'skeptic', 'who', 'truth', 'hard', 'way', 'husband', 'played', 'Xander', 'Berkeley', 'snobby', 'charecter', 'remember', 'Air', 'Force', 'One', 'Even', 'gave', 'film', '5', 'stars', 'do', 'have', 'couple', 'issues', 'it-primarily', 'skeptically', 'stupid', 'police', 'force', 'Helen', 'tune', 'skeptic', 'believer', 'rather', 'quickly', 'too', 'bad', 'police', 'are', ""n't"", 'smart', 'saying', 'seeing', 'believing', 'other', 'issue', 'animal', 'child', 'cruelty', 'However', ""'m"", 'grateful', 'cruelty', 'was', 'implied', 'quick.Director/Writer', 'Bernard', 'Rose', 'hit', 'right', 'moves', 'frightning', 'surprise', 'around', 'corner', 'Phillip', 'Glass', 'eerily', 'effective', 'musical', 'score', 'Clive', 'Barker', 'had', 'influence', 'film', 'executive', 'producer', 'even', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'H.Raiser', 'films', 'honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'personal', 'reasons', 'can', 'tell.I', 'know', 'just', 'movie', 'scared', 'enough', 'not', 'tempt', 'fates']",N/A
