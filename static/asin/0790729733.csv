93142,A1ALOIPRR8Q06J,0790729733,"2 cents ""meaningless memes""","[0, 0]","More has been written on this historical event than any other in history and I'll add a couple worthless lines of my own (if for no other reason than for some reason I decided to write up a bunch of reviews for spy/ conspiracy flicks on Amazon). I have virtually no interest in JFK or who killed him or why. The president that exists in popular imagination and media is largely a fabrication. The very fact Kennedy's brief time in the White House came to labeled ""Camelot"" perfectly illustrates mankind's tragic susceptibility to propaganda and favoring of myth over mere facts and empirical evidence. Always look at the voting record. Always look at the record. First thing to say is this is a movie. People always are saying, ""It's just a movie"" and of course often times because somebody they're responding to at least in their judgement is taking things too seriously. Well, I'd venture to say that this is indeed a great and in some ways brilliant movie, especially the editing. JFK is a classic crime mystery and political thriller. 4.5 Stars for the movie. However, Oliver Stone's JFK is not a subsitute for reading some of the many books--some of which aren't crazy at all--on this event. Oliver Stone wanted his film to challenge the official story, particularly the Warren Commission Report which he simply regards ""a great myth"". Stone took it upon himself to fight this myth, ""And in order to fight a myth, maybe you have to create another one, a countermyth"". Keep this in mind when considering the movie.For my part I think Oswald did it and probably acted alone with nobody else involved in planning and carrying out the hit. A case hasn't been made to really convict any other individual or group even if there have indeed been many doubts and suspicions cast, most of which are unreasonable. But what if ""X"" individual or group was involved? What of it now? Without getting into the byzantine labyrinth of JFK assassination conspiracy theories I'd just briefly mention that as far as the bigger ones go in which fairly large numbers of people are involved--sometimes from different governmental agencies and other groups--these are mostly discredited by the fact that their isn't more proof of them and at this late date no death bed confessions.And here we are as I add my 2 cents and people are still obsessing over this assassination. If you want to know what you can do for your country I would at least guess Kennedy would be of the opinion that you'd serve the common good by focusing on the many problems at hand, in the world now, geting involved with others doing work--taking action--to make America a great nation and in doing this you would best serve the idealism that JFK came to symbolize. That's how you fight the forces of darkness. Besides you don't ask what the government can do for you because it doesn't care about doing any good for most citizens--you join with other citizens to force the government to live up to its promise. The president isn't who you place your hopes and dreams in for the country.",3,alternative myth,1228780800,"12 9, 2008",2008,3043,"['More', 'been', 'written', 'historical', 'event', 'other', 'history', ""'ll"", 'add', 'couple', 'worthless', 'lines', 'own', 'other', 'reason', 'reason', 'decided', 'write', 'up', 'bunch', 'reviews', 'spy/', 'conspiracy', 'flicks', 'Amazon', 'have', 'virtually', 'interest', 'JFK', 'who', 'killed', 'why', 'president', 'popular', 'imagination', 'media', 'largely', 'fabrication', 'very', 'fact', 'Kennedy', 'brief', 'time', 'White', 'House', 'came', 'labeled', 'Camelot', 'perfectly', 'mankind', 'tragic', 'susceptibility', 'propaganda', 'favoring', 'myth', 'mere', 'facts', 'empirical', 'evidence', 'Always', 'look', 'voting', 'record', 'Always', 'look', 'record', 'First', 'thing', 'say', 'movie', 'People', 'always', 'are', 'saying', 'just', 'movie', 'course', 'often', 'somebody', ""'re"", 'responding', 'least', 'judgement', 'taking', 'things', 'too', 'seriously', 'Well', ""'d"", 'venture', 'say', 'indeed', 'great', 'ways', 'brilliant', 'movie', 'especially', 'editing', 'JFK', 'classic', 'crime', 'mystery', 'political', 'thriller', '4.5', 'Stars', 'movie', 'However', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'JFK', 'not', 'subsitute', 'reading', 'many', 'books', 'are', ""n't"", 'crazy', 'event', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'wanted', 'film', 'challenge', 'official', 'story', 'particularly', 'Warren', 'Commission', 'Report', 'simply', 'great', 'myth', 'Stone', 'took', 'fight', 'myth', 'order', 'fight', 'myth', 'maybe', 'have', 'create', 'one', 'countermyth', 'Keep', 'mind', 'when', 'considering', 'movie.For', 'part', 'think', 'Oswald', 'did', 'probably', 'acted', 'alone', 'nobody', 'else', 'involved', 'planning', 'carrying', 'out', 'hit', 'case', ""n't"", 'been', 'made', 'really', 'convict', 'other', 'individual', 'group', 'even', 'have', 'indeed', 'been', 'many', 'doubts', 'suspicions', 'cast', 'most', 'are', 'unreasonable', 'what', 'X', 'individual', 'group', 'was', 'involved', 'What', 'now', 'getting', 'byzantine', 'labyrinth', 'JFK', 'assassination', 'conspiracy', 'theories', ""'d"", 'just', 'briefly', 'mention', 'as', 'far', 'bigger', 'ones', 'go', 'fairly', 'large', 'numbers', 'people', 'are', 'involved', 'sometimes', 'different', 'governmental', 'agencies', 'other', 'groups', 'are', 'mostly', 'discredited', 'fact', ""n't"", 'more', 'proof', 'late', 'date', 'death', 'bed', 'confessions.And', 'here', 'are', 'add', '2', 'cents', 'people', 'are', 'still', 'obsessing', 'assassination', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'country', 'would', 'least', 'guess', 'Kennedy', 'would', 'be', 'opinion', ""'d"", 'serve', 'common', 'good', 'focusing', 'many', 'problems', 'hand', 'world', 'now', 'geting', 'involved', 'others', 'doing', 'work', 'taking', 'action', 'make', 'America', 'great', 'nation', 'doing', 'would', 'best', 'serve', 'idealism', 'JFK', 'came', 'symbolize', 'how', 'fight', 'forces', 'darkness', 'do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'what', 'government', 'can', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'doing', 'good', 'most', 'citizens', 'join', 'other', 'citizens', 'force', 'government', 'live', 'up', 'promise', 'president', ""n't"", 'who', 'place', 'hopes', 'dreams', 'country']",JFK Director's Cut
93143,A2GOAEF0ZRNG13,0790729733,Aaron,"[3, 4]","If not the best film of the 90's, it's certainly the most important one.  When I first saw this film in the theaters during its initial release, I was just totally blown away, I sat there in my seat after the final credits  and tried to gather my thoughts together after what I had witnessed.  I was  astonished at the sheer brilliance of the filmmaking, JFK has to rank as  the best edited film of all time.  Technically, the film is brillant and  breathtaking.  A richly textured and dazzling cinematic experience.  However, this is not style over substance.  Stone presents us with a huge  amount of information:  names, dates, different theories, flashbacks,  flashbacks within flashbacks, ect... It's incredible how much information,  how many ideas Stone packs into his film, but his direction is so assured  that we are NEVER for one moment confused or lost in the material.  He and  his co workers have masterfully assembled all this material into a hypnotic  tapestry (his use of the Zapruder footage in the film is brilliant).  The  assassination of JFK is one of the most tragic events in modern American  history.  I've never subscribed to the Warren Commission explanation, and  Stone does a masterful job illustrating his ideas and theories.  It's  important to remember that this is NOT a documentary, its one filmmakers  exploration of a pivotal moment in U.S. history.  Even if you dont  subscribe to Stone's theory, you gotta admit, it's a breathtaking film.  This film will scare you, inspire you, and force you to think and act.  It's so refreshing to see an American film that is SO political and thought  provoking.  It's over 3 1/2 hours, but you'd never know.

93146,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,0790729733,Acute Observer,"[2, 2]","This film is based on Jim Garrison's book, which tells of his investigation into the conspiracy. JG joined the National Guard in 1940, served five years in Army artillery, went to law school, joined the FBI, went home to New Orleans, and was elected District Attorney (3 terms) and then a judge. The controversy around this movie is due to Oliver Stone's dramatization of the facts. In one scene DA Garrison points out that LH Oswald's Camp St. address was across from the FBI, the CIA, and Naval Intelligence. At that point in time the offices of the FBI and CIA were a few blocks away. But the point is dramatically made: the ""Fair Play for Cuba Committee"" was practically underfoot. Who was watching them?I think it was a mistake to cast Ed Asner as the private detective who was former Naval Intelligence, former FBI. Efrem Zimbalist JR had a better resemblance. Walter Matthau played Senator Russell Long. The movie generally follows the book. DA Garrison hears of the connection to David Ferrie, and turns him over to the FBI; nothing happened. A few years later he talks to Senator Long and learns of his doubts on the Warren Report. JG then opens his own investigation into any crime committed in New Orleans. When his secret investigation is uncovered, the corporate media vilify his operation. There was NO cooperation from either J Edgar Hoover, President LBJ, or government agencies. The trial ended with a 'not guilty' verdict. The Congressional investigations in the 1970s revealed many more facts. Many books were written from this new information.The ""Mister X"" brought in as a 'deus ex machina' is not in Garrison's book. He is based on L Fletcher Prouty, whose articles or books were available to Oliver Stone. LF Prouty joined the Army in 1941, and retired decades later. His experiences were in ""Black Ops"": executive action for the Government. Prouty was in the Philippines, Vietnam, etc. Prouty pointed out that it was SOP to have Army officers scout any location for a Presidential visit. It was not done in Dallas. The questions of ""Mr X"" remain: who benefited from JFK's assassination, and, who could cover it up.So watch and enjoy this drama. You should read ""On the Trail of the Assassins"", or other books on the unsolved mystery of the Assassination of JFK. Is the conspiracy still trying to kill JFK's reputation? JFK was neither the first or last Ruler to enjoy female companionship as a perquisite of office, like stars in music or sports. Politicians are not moral role leaders, like ministers, priests, or rabbis.An assassin who uses a pistol will be caught or killed. They are fanatics who sacrifice themselves for their cause. As assassin who uses a rifle will be able to get away to collect his pay; this implies a conspiracy.

And at least 10 other world class actors grace this film.

And this film bombards you with so many facts and scenarios your head will be spinning more than Linda Blair.  The main flaw is that the film simply offers too many scenarios and crams them into a film that is too long (189 minutes/add 20 for director's cut).The most compelling scene is that of X (Donald Sutherland) as he gives Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) details of ""Black Operations"".As X says, ""noone said aloud 'let's kill Kennedy', but it was understood and the conspiracy took shape in the traditional form of a black op"".  Unfortunately this doesn't gel with reality.But the film is actually focused on Jim Garrison, the New Orleans attorney who investigated such unlikely characters as Clay Shaw and David Ferry.

93150,A3ONKRWEZMJJUV,0790729733,"Adrian Duran Sanchez ""Conductista""","[5, 7]","Understand this: film making is an Art / Industry. Art because of its all-dominant story narration (a film will always tell a story), that's why it has an Author (the director), with his or hers point of view of that single story. Its an industry because all of the human effort and huge amounts of money used to bring into screen any type of story. Unfortunately in many countries and specially in Hollywood Big Studio System, it's become all about making money, this is the Gringo way. And so, every once in while filmmaking is brought to the art level, and even better, more rarely a director with a soul and conscience delivers an important film to society and art in general, this is the case with Oliver Stone's J.F.K. Stone asks 150 questions about President Kennedy's murder, maybe he got 5 things wrong, but what about the other 145 things he got right? The Big Shots where afraid of a man that could have change things for better, wiping out their biggest moneymaker: WAR, taking away all their Power (both politically and military). Frustrated with this possibility, it became evident Kennedy had to be put to rest. If you follow the clues, understanding them in their context to the end, you will know WHO did it, and WHY they did it. J.F.K does something that has become more and more rarely in the USA film industry; it makes you Think!Jim Garrison's fearless quest for truth against a corrupted Government has no parallel in U.S.A history, and Oliver Stone takes such a brave and honest piece of Gringo history, narrating it with his unique straight and Powerful style (the best word that describes this brilliant film). Stone has the courage to point you with his finger and say: How dare you sons of bit... The film's magnificent script was stolen twice beginning shooting. Censorship (back up by who knows who), tried to stop the movie from being shown in theaters. Fortunately the film made it to the screen. Only a keen and masterful director like Oliver Stone is capable to make such a Masterpiece, all the praises to him and his crew. More than speculations the movie becomes aware of the facts. The complexity of the script becomes a puzzle put in order. Kennedy's shot to the face, the most ridiculous bullet in all history (more spin offs and turns would had made this bullet a ballet dancer), the Shadow Conspiracy shown here with that breathtaking speech from Donald Sutherland's character inter cut with Stone's trade mark black and white documentary photography and fast paced editing. Vietnam, money, power thirst, the Zapruder film as the main key evidence, is right in your face; this is pure and honest patriotism. Further than entertainment, is captivating, the movie won't let you turn your face away. What more could you ask for? But there is more, this film will test time and go along for new generations to communicate and pass on the knowledge of this tragic event, provoking an insight conscience in every new spectator, it can't be forgotten by obvious reasons.The new Directors Cut, features 17 minutes of never before seen footage, making the view richer, the extras will make more complete the whole picture as well as the points of view of the objective Insight especially the simultaneous commentary audio track by Oliver Stone, and the Assassination Update (The New Documents), Beyond JFK: The Question of Conspiracy, feature-length documentary, and Meet Mr. X: The Personality and Thoughts of Fletcher Prouty. So, this is a must for your DVD collection (both the Double Disc Special Edition, Director's Cut, and the Single Disc Special Edition, Director's Cut are great).The last thing to say about J.F.K is that it is more shocking today than it was yesterday. Why? Because it reflects today's corruption and manipulation of a Government that carries on with blood in its hands, and bloody hands are never washed clean, a lesson not enough thought in schools, its ugly but some one has to do it.

Garrison stumble suopn a conspiracy so deep,so multilayerd, that it would appear that there were people lined uopn around the block to whack the president of the united states.The Salient point of this conspiracy theory for me is thsi:people in washington cant keep a secret for 30 minutes,never mind 30-40 YEARS. If you can sepaerate fact from fiction{and with JFK it is very difficult} you get an immensely satisfying thriller. Costner is serviceable as Garrison{Garrison himself has a cameo as Earl Warren], Jack Lemmon,and Ed Asner are excellent, Joe Pesci is brilliant a dave ferri, Tommy lee Jones understated as Clay Shaw, John candy as a shady N.O. lawyer, Gary Oldman as Lee Oswald is wonderfully paranoid ,though for me,Donald Sutherland steals the movie as &quot;X&quot;,in a ten minute tour `de force. This is a brilliant film,exquisitely shot, superbly acted,wonderfully concieved. I think it is by far Stones finest work[though Salvador is close}.

93152,A20LY8E9NGYA4M,0790729733,Alejandro Cortes,"[1, 1]","""JFK"" is a movie that combines drama with a documentary style, and it's a shocking experience for many reasons. The movie was made back on those days when Kevin Costner was a superstar in a hot streak, with movies like ""Dances With Wolves"" and ""Bull Durham"", and in this movie Costner gave one of his finest performances. He was the centerpiece of this daring and powerful movie.But he was not alone, Oliver Stone surrounded him with an all-star cast, that includes big names like Sissy Spacek, Tommy Lee Jones, Joe Pesci, Gary Oldman, Kevin Bacon, Jack Lemmon, John Candy, Donald Sutherland, Walter Matthau, Wayne Knight and Vincent D'Onofrio.""JFK"" is built with theories, some of them are obviously fiction or just a mere supposition, but a lot of them seem authentic and based in real evidence. Oliver Stone pointed the finger to almost everybody: the FBI, the CIA, Lyndon Johnson, J. Edgar Hoover, Clay Shaw and many others. But he seems to hit the center of the target when he practically says that Kennedy was murdered because he didn't wanted to take part in the HUGE industry that is the war, an industry that moves BILLIONS of dollars, and a big part of USA's economical power.""JFK"" presented an innovative narrative style, it combined real footage with acted scenes, but the acted parts were processed as historical footage, he also used a fast, dynamic editing to create interest in the audience, and of course ""JFK"" is interesting and provocative at all time. ""JFK"" has great acting (although John Candy was over the top, and some hair wigs are just hilarious), great direction, a solid script (yes, some theories are too forced, but there are solid theories as well), and the movie achieves its biggest goal: the movie gives something to think about to the viewer.",4,AN INTRIGUING DOCU-DRAMA.,1092268800,"08 12, 2004",2004,1777,"['JFK', 'movie', 'drama', 'documentary', 'style', 'shocking', 'experience', 'many', 'reasons', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'back', 'days', 'when', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'was', 'superstar', 'hot', 'streak', 'movies', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'Bull', 'Durham', 'movie', 'Costner', 'gave', 'one', 'finest', 'performances', 'was', 'centerpiece', 'daring', 'powerful', 'movie.But', 'was', 'not', 'alone', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'surrounded', 'all-star', 'cast', 'big', 'names', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'Joe', 'Pesci', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'John', 'Candy', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'Walter', 'Matthau', 'Wayne', 'Knight', 'Vincent', ""D'Onofrio"", 'JFK', 'built', 'theories', 'are', 'obviously', 'fiction', 'just', 'mere', 'supposition', 'lot', 'seem', 'authentic', 'based', 'real', 'evidence', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'pointed', 'finger', 'almost', 'everybody', 'FBI', 'CIA', 'Lyndon', 'Johnson', 'J.', 'Edgar', 'Hoover', 'Clay', 'Shaw', 'many', 'others', 'hit', 'center', 'target', 'when', 'practically', 'Kennedy', 'was', 'murdered', 'did', ""n't"", 'wanted', 'take', 'part', 'HUGE', 'industry', 'war', 'industry', 'BILLIONS', 'dollars', 'big', 'part', 'USA', 'economical', 'power', 'JFK', 'presented', 'innovative', 'narrative', 'style', 'combined', 'real', 'footage', 'acted', 'scenes', 'acted', 'parts', 'were', 'processed', 'historical', 'footage', 'also', 'used', 'fast', 'dynamic', 'editing', 'create', 'interest', 'audience', 'course', 'JFK', 'interesting', 'provocative', 'time', 'JFK', 'great', 'acting', 'John', 'Candy', 'was', 'top', 'hair', 'wigs', 'are', 'just', 'hilarious', 'great', 'direction', 'solid', 'script', 'yes', 'theories', 'are', 'too', 'forced', 'are', 'solid', 'theories', 'well', 'movie', 'biggest', 'goal', 'movie', 'something', 'think', 'viewer']",JFK Director's Cut

93158,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0790729733,Andrew Ellington,"[4, 5]","I have made it pretty clear in the past that Oliver Stone is a director I just don't really get.  He is lauded by many and he is considered to be one of the most controversial directors of our time, but every film of his that I have seen has proved to be less controversial and more boring and absurd.  He just seems to miss the point.  I know that some do not agree, but I also know that I am not the only one to feel this way.A friend of mine the other day stated that Stone was an `enemy of fun'.That said; I absolutely adore `JFK'; I mean, utterly and unconditionally flaunt this film as one of the greatest political thrillers of all time.  From the first few seconds of footage I was completely engulfed in this film, and Stone's dedicated delivery never let up.  I was blown away because I really expected to pass over this as merely decent at best, but I honestly am taken aback by just how brilliant this film really is.  From the acting to the script to Stone's masterful art of filmmaking, `JFK' is an unforgettable masterpiece if I do say so myself.It's safe to say that I really had no idea what this movie was about before I sat down to watch it.  I actually thought that Kevin Costner was playing Kennedy himself, that's how `in the dark' I was about the true nature of this film.  Instead, Costner plays district attorney Jim Garrison, a man on a mission.  After the horrendous murder of John F. Kennedy, Garrison makes it his personal agenda to bring the man (or men) responsible down.  When Lee Harvey Oswald is arrested and then murdered Garrison smells foul play and so he, along with his team, pursues the truth at all costs.  As Garrison sinks deeper into the seedy underbelly of deceit and betrayal he uncovers a truth that sadly only he can see, and this truth (what is truth really?) causes more problems than good for Garrison and his family.First and foremost I really need to praise the script, up and down, inside and out because it is pristine on all fronts.  Not only is the film informative but it is engaging.  It doesn't just throw random facts at you and expect you to follow along.  Instead, it lines each commanding sequence of events with facts that melt down off the screen and caress our minds.  We never feel like we're being preached to, and we never feel like we're being manipulated.  We are merely being told a story, and story that twists itself and morphs into something so much bigger than we ever could have expected.  The opening sequences that map out Kennedy's term and his horrific murder are brilliantly constructed, for they immediately engulf you into this tragic tale.  The reshot footage of the murder is spellbinding and gut wrenching and totally effective in getting the audience immersed in the film from the very beginning.Then there is the acting, all of which is superb.  I normally find Costner rather dull (except his wildly brilliant turn in `The Upside of Anger') and here he does skirt around to prospect of boring me (he just has a very monotone delivery) but he really pulls it all together when he needs to (his final courtroom monologue is brilliantly delivered).The rest of the extensive cast though never misses a beat.  Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Bacon and Gary Oldman take highest praises from me.  Jones (who was Oscar nominated) is sublimely sleazy as Clay Shaw.  There is a scene where he is being interrogated by Garrison and as he denies all the allegations he carries this smirk of satisfaction across his face that sent chills down my spine.  Kevin Bacon (who I am never fond of) is masterful here and Oldman is just plain chilling as Lee Harvey Oswald.  Singling anyone out is very hard though.  Joe Pesci is on the top of his game, as is Michael Rooker, and Sissy Spacek is heartbreaking as Garrison's conflicted wife.  Jack Lemmon, John Candy and Walter Matthau make the most of their limited screen time, and Donald Sutherland is flawlessly captivating in his cameo as the informant X.The star of this film is none other than Oliver Stone though.  His direction, his complete grasp of subject, is astonishing.  Honestly, this was one of the most pleasant surprises in recent memory for me.  I really thought that nothing Stone did would ever move me, let alone be one of my favorite films of any given year, but `JFK' is just too perfect not to completely fall for.There has been a lot said about the truthfulness of the film, many attacking it for manipulating facts and expressing opinion, but honestly, isn't that what film is all about.  Stone is able here to give us his own interpretation of truth without ever forcing us to accept what we don't want to.  Nothing is presented in a way that conditions us.  Instead he delivers a solid thriller than exposes what `could' have taken place without ever telling us what `did' happen.Quite honestly, this film is a total triumph.",5,Political

93159,A1IKOYZVFHO1XP,0790729733,andy8047,"[2, 7]","Ladies and gentlemen,citizens,it is with humble respect that director Oliver Stone presents the investigation of the death of a great American,John Fitzgerald Kennedy,the 35th President of the United States. It was Stone's hope and intention,that this courtroom epic,which runs for approximately three and a half hours,will become a living memory and an inspiration to both current and future generations. Kevin Costner is Jim Garrison,a district attorney who represents Lee Harvey Oswald who was accused of Kennedy's November 22,1963 assassination in Dallas. Sissy Spacek is Jim's wife. This film also features special appearances by Kevin Bacon and the late John Candy. Unlike Kennedy,then-Texas governor(now deceased) John B. Connolly survived the shooting although he was wounded. I dedicate this film to the memory of Kennedy and the surviving members of his family. Stone should make epics about the lives and post-presidency deaths of Lyndon B. Johnson,Richard M.

But few can argue that Stone's 1991 depiction of Louisianna District Attorney Jim Garrison's obsessive search for the truth of JFK's 1963 assassination is a masterpiece and offers an interesting and thought-provoking look at one of the most significant and tragic events in American history.New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison (brilliantly played by Jim Garrison) is just one of the millions of people affected by the assassination of John F. Kennedy. He also becomes fixated on Kennedy's alleged assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald (Gary Oldman) and whether his involvement in the assassination is actually true. With the help of his partners, he delves deeper into the case, in which he encounters a number of shady characters, including a man simply known as X and crooked businessman Clay Bertrand,  Garrison will stop at nothing to expose the truth behind one of the worst moments in American history.This film is a sweeping epic from start to finish. It is especially noted for including actual footage of the Zapruder film, unseen for many years. The acting is brilliant, mostly thanks to a brilliant cast that includes Costner, Tommy Lee Jones (as Bertrand), Oldman, Kevin Bacon, Sissy Spacek, John Candy, Lemar Burton (Newman from ""Seinfeld""), Jack Lemmon, Sally Kirkland, Laurie Metcalf, Edward Asner, Walter Matthou, Donald Sutherland (as X) and Joe Pesci. It is also worth noting that the real Jim Garrison has a small cameo as an interrigator as well.This is definitely a must have movie that belongs in any film collection.

After seeing JFK, it turned out that I was dead wrong. JFK is an incredible masterpiece and is the best movie ever in the whole career of Oliver Stone. Absolutely outstanding are the film editing, the story-telling, and most of all, the acting. Kevin Bacon, Joe Pesci, and Kevin Costner are mesmerizing and captivating. It's a shame that all of them, although I disagree vehemently with Tommy Lee Jones', aren't worthy of accolades. Simply, Kevin Costner is thoroughly brilliant. I've often complained that films taking on a supposedly huge magnitude and underestimating it, but Oliver Stone really did achieve the behemoth scale in its landscape based on the bureaucratic levels in terms of politics. Jim Garrison, in a brilliant quote, after learning the real story from Donald Sutherland's character sums up the startling discovery, ""The size of this is...beyond me."" Yes, quite so...so beyond me, too. JFK is just a brilliant political thriller. Three hours and twenty-six minutes of this director's cut whizzes through me like if it is a short story mystery. I absolutely love this movie so much for its attention-grabber, and I never thought conspiracy uncovering would have been this exciting as I saw in JFK. It is so methodically a much better film than Thirteen Days.6/11: JFK is a tour de force of performances from a throughly all-star cast at the hands of a master filmmaker. Oliver Stone has directed his best work in JFK. It's a complete picture, tackling a dangerous subject involving too many conjectures and ""what ifs"" with very little substantial proofs. In short, it's a conspiracy theory picture at best. It is also a great piece of work. Kevin Costner should be lauded for handling his work with ease and confidence. He is a professional actor who ranks up there with the best of the best. Obviously, everybody else throws their chips in and takes the picture further to another level. JFK is 206 minutes of fascination, never letting down or losing steam. It's a brilliant picture.

Its editing and cinematography won well-deserved Oscars. It is amazing how Stone manages to include so much information and actually  creating momentum out of them. Despite the fact that it throws all sorts of  rumours and theories about the Kennedy-assasination at us (and this over  three hours long), the film is never confusing or boring. Another asset is  John Williams' very good score. The only weaknesses of &quot;JFK&quot; are  the rather uninspired treatment of Garrison's family life and Garrison's  overly sentimental oration at the end of the movie.

For years, Jim was bashed and destroyed by the federal government and media. However after viewing this movie, one can't help but finally give Jim Garrison the credit he deserved for having the courage and guts to bring the jfk assasination to trial. There are alot of people who to this day question Jim, but as years pass, it is proven more and more that he was right in his theory of a conspiracy to kill the president. This movie is based on Jim Garrison's book ""On The TraiL Of The Assasins"" and also on Jim Marrs book ""Crossfire: The Plot to Kill Kennedy"". Once you view this movie, i suggest you read those 2 books and i'm sure you'll have all the facts you need. The special edition DVD includes many special features including the ""new documents"" which further proves Jim's theory. Jim Garrison was a very special man and Oliver Stone knew this and finally let Jim fight back against the people that belived his investigation was a fraud.

But this is Oliver Stone's picture all the way, you can clearly see that he is also obsessed with the Kennedy assassination and that's where the film gets it's passion and it's  unstoppable search for the truth. He took as a premise, the case of Jim  Garrison, the only lawyer to ever take the Kennedy assassination to court.  This is only the excuse for Stone to bombard us with fascinating and  dangerous information that may or may not be true, but we all know that  something fishy was going on. Besides being a directorial triumph it is  also a technical landmark with outstanding editing, probably among the best  ever. A terrific all-star cast bring all these characters to life. Some we  pity, others we despise and some we respect. Kevin Costner gives a  dramatically powerful and effective performance as Jim Garrison, he's got  the All-American look stamped on his face. An extremely good supporting  cast filled with heavy-hitters. Tommy Lee Jones is brilliant as Clay Shaw  (Clay Bertrand). Gary Oldman is quietly effective as the patsy himself, Lee  Harvey Oswald. Joe Pesci, Kevin Bacon and John Candy are also great. Jack  Lemmon and Walter Matthau appear in yet another film together, and both  deliver good performances.

It is wise to keep the two totally separate.  Oliver Stone the filmmaker is a great artist with a masterful hand at cutting edge story telling and &quot;JFK&quot; shows that talent at its peak.  Oliver Stone the real life person can be grating, obnoxious and offensive to just about everyone and would do himself a big favor by not making personal appearances.  This is his personal, artistic version of JFK's assassination.  He makes a compelling case for the proposition that JFK was murdered as part of a conspiracy by powerful forces in our own government rather than Lee Harvey Oswald acting alone.  JFK was obviously a hero of Stone's and Stone even believes that JFK would have prevented the escalation of the Vietnam War.  In fact, he believes that the Vietnam War was made possible only by getting rid of JFK. I buy more into Stone's  conspiracy theory than I do this lofty, ultra hero view of JFK.  However, this is his vision and he certainly can put on quite a case, which he does through Kevin Costner, acting as District Attorney Jim Garrison of New Orleans prosecuting Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones) for conspiring to murder JFK.  Costner shows his full leading man appeal plus the intensity, earnestness and idealism that had become the trademark for a Costner leading role.  Stone is known for getting fabulous male performances and that is true of every male performance in &quot;JFK.&quot;  For example, Gary Oldman is fabulous as Oswald as is Jones as Shaw and Joe Pesci as David Ferry.  Sissy Spacek is reduced to a wife as wallpaper role, which is also typical of Stone, but you don't go to an Oliver Stone film to see great roles for women.  This is a long movie that seemingly is over too fast since Stone really knows how to keep things moving.

Jim Garrison and his attempt to find the truth about JFK's assassination, and if there was a conspiracy, to bring the conspirators to justice. Though he didn't get a conviction, he at least went farther than any other law enforcement entities. He brought a murder and conspiracy charge against one of the alleged participants. According to this movie, the jury believed there was a conspiracy, but they didn't feel his case met the burden of proof as far as the individual charged was concerned. Subsequently, it was revealed that he worked for the CIA.""JFK"" is Oliver Stone's favorite Oliver Stone film. He considers it his 'Godfather.' ""JFK"" is also Oliver Stone's most controversial film, with some who share his high opinion, and others who consider it blasphemy, tantamount to treason. Walter Cronkite, who was at one time the most trusted man in America, thought it was rubbish. The head of at least one media empire suppressed a 34 word capsule review that was too favorable. The writer complained about it and was fired. I think they were killing the messenger because they didn't like the message.-----------------------------Jim Garrison: Thank you for your time, David. I'm sorry this has to end inconveniently for you but I am going to have to detain you for further questioning by the FBI.David Ferrie: Why, what's wrong?Jim Garrison: David, I find your story simply not believable.David Ferrie: Really? What part?==========================================Likewise, some may find Oliver Stone's story simply not believable, but it is a lot more believable than the conclusions of the Warren Report.-------------------Jim Garrison: Once you conclude the magic bullet could not create all seven of those wounds, you'd have to conclude that there was a fourth shot and a second rifle. And if there was a second rifleman, then by definition, there had to be a conspiracy.===========================The director of a film can manipulate the truth -- omit certain details, highlight others, cherry pick certain facts to support his thesis, or completely fabricate from beginning to end. Fiction, as a literary form has been called ""lies that tell the truth"" and when you are talking about film, you just might be more in the realm of lies that tell even bigger lies."" But I think that JFK was researched and put together well, and it was much more than either mere entertainment or propaganda. It actually was very entertaining, but in a way that makes you think. Though the truth of what happened that day in November may be ""a mystery wrapped in a riddle inside an enigma"" -- obscured so much that we may never know the real truth, Oliver Stone has really done a masterful job. I think that just like Jim Garrison, Stone has shown that Lee Harvey Oswald didn't act alone, if he was in fact an assassin and not just a patsy. The sequence in the courtroom where Kevin Costner, as Jim Garrison, lays out his case that there was at least a second rifleman is a masterful sequence. Filmed in one long take, requiring prodigious memorization by Costner, it is the compelling highlight of  JFK. Once you get past the hurdle of the idea foisted on the American Public by the Warren Commission that JFK was killed by a lone assassin, then all kinds of questions open up. It really gets you thinking.-----------------------X: Fundamentally, people are suckers for the truth. And the truth is on your side, Bubba.===========================Most people who were alive when JFK was killed remember where they were that day. It seems that when JFK died, our innocence died also. Jello Biafra of the punk band, The Dead Kennedys says that the name of his group was thought up by some hippies, Grateful Dead Heads who threw it out as a possibility in a long list of possible names. He grasped the significance of that name, as it expressed the death of our innocence. Jerry Seinfeld, trying to deal with the fundamental contradiction -- the rift in our society, used humor. In a parody of ""the single bullet theory"" called, ""the single lugie theory"" a baseball player is spat on in an incident after a game. Wayne Knight, who played Newman, Jerry's nemesis, is in both the TV Show, and the film, ""JFK."" In both, he plays the same part in the courtroom reenactment. I don't know exactly what all this means, but I would submit for your approval that the JFK assassination is the tragic touchstone of our generation, and that Oliver Stone, in taking it as the subject of his film, was tackling the biggest issue of our time. It was bound to be controversial. Perhaps you will walk away from it still unconvinced. But even if it just gets you thinking, ""JFK"" has done its job.--------------Guy Bannister: Camelot in smithereens.=========================SELECTED FILMOGRAPHY OF JFK CAST MEMBERSNatural Born Killers(1994) ....

93191,A1ASCECH3KOZ3P,0790729733,C. Gardner,"[1, 1]","Although there's a jumble of competing theories out there, Stone's screenplay uses Jim Garrison's 1967 botched attempt to bring conspiracy charges against the CIA as a springboard to compile and present the most glaring glitches in the official lone nut scenario. Stone doesn't advance any one of the many theories; the purpose of this film was to disseminate a ""counter-myth to the Warren Report"", as he puts it. In order to keep the film's running time down, some of the characters are composites, and events are conflated and rearranged chronologically. It is not strictly factual with regard to details, particularly the people Garrison tried to gather as witnesses for his trial (some other reviews here go into detail about the changes). But, given Stone's aim, the details are not the crucial issue; his purpose is to get people thinking about the military-industrial complex's overweening power in our democracy (as it hinged upon the ""coup d'etat"", as Garrison put it, of 11/22/63) and the film is a masterpiece of counter-propaganda. Stone finds a perfect balance between Garrison's obsession with the assassination, his turbulent relationship with a staff led into unprecedented territory, and his upset family life. The concluding trial scene is both devastating and moving. And technically, ""JFK"" has the most effective and (for once) appropriate use of the kitchen-sink editing techniques you'll ever see: hand-held camera, jittery jump-cuts, switching from black and white...The acting is uniformly excellent (except perhaps for a few of Costner's moments at home with his family), particularly Gary Oldman's high-strung Oswald and Sutherland's mysterious General X.",5,Back and to the left: A weapon of mass instruction?,1059523200,"07 30, 2003",2003,1681,"['jumble', 'competing', 'theories', 'there', 'Stone', 'screenplay', 'Jim', 'Garrison', '1967', 'botched', 'attempt', 'bring', 'conspiracy', 'charges', 'CIA', 'springboard', 'compile', 'present', 'most', 'glaring', 'glitches', 'official', 'lone', 'nut', 'scenario', 'Stone', ""n't"", 'advance', 'one', 'many', 'theories', 'purpose', 'film', 'was', 'disseminate', 'counter-myth', 'Warren', 'Report', 'order', 'keep', 'film', 'running', 'time', 'down', 'characters', 'are', 'composites', 'events', 'are', 'conflated', 'rearranged', 'chronologically', 'not', 'strictly', 'factual', 'regard', 'details', 'particularly', 'people', 'Garrison', 'tried', 'gather', 'witnesses', 'trial', 'other', 'reviews', 'here', 'go', 'detail', 'changes', 'given', 'Stone', 'aim', 'details', 'are', 'not', 'crucial', 'issue', 'purpose', 'get', 'people', 'thinking', 'military-industrial', 'complex', 'overweening', 'power', 'democracy', 'hinged', 'coup', ""d'etat"", 'Garrison', 'put', '11/22/63', 'film', 'masterpiece', 'counter-propaganda', 'Stone', 'perfect', 'balance', 'Garrison', 'obsession', 'assassination', 'turbulent', 'relationship', 'staff', 'led', 'unprecedented', 'territory', 'upset', 'family', 'life', 'concluding', 'trial', 'scene', 'devastating', 'moving', 'technically', 'JFK', 'most', 'effective', 'once', 'appropriate', 'use', 'kitchen-sink', 'editing', 'techniques', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', 'hand-held', 'camera', 'jittery', 'jump-cuts', 'switching', 'black', 'white', 'acting', 'uniformly', 'excellent', 'perhaps', 'few', 'Costner', 'moments', 'home', 'family', 'particularly', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'high-strung', 'Oswald', 'Sutherland', 'mysterious', 'General', 'X']",JFK Director's Cut

93196,A2ZDGC1S2QZFU0,0790729733,Chris Jothi,"[8, 9]","Upon release JFK was heavily criticised for being a speculative film that was liberal with its account on the JFK assassination. I believe it is the greatest film ever made, and that these critics are probably the same people who predicted Fight Club would inspire a generation to start beating each other up. It is not my favourite film but JFK is perfect in every way, and showcases the heights at which this medium can reach.There are two DVDs available. Warner were hasty when DVD arrived and shipped off loads of films that had zero features (the odd trailer here and there) and JFK was one of them. Thankfully there is now a Special Edition DVD that spans over two discs. The first contains the film and Stone's commentary. The second disc's notable inclusions are the ""multimedia essays"" and a near hours worth of deleted scenes. The second disc is great but even if it were not part of the package I would still be urging you to buy it because the commentary Stone provides is ridiculously good.If you look at JFK on merely a filmmaking level you will appreciate it all the more. It is probably the most accomplished, daring and epic film ever made. Lord Of The Rings may have been difficult to film (understatement) but no one can tell me it is as complex as JFK in terms of plotting and editing. There are so many scenes, cuts and speaking roles (think Traffic times ten!) that it startles me how under appreciated the film is. The courtroom scene alone should be analysed by film students across the world. Then think of the cast (the best ever assembled?): Kevin Costner, Tommy Lee Jones, Joe Pesci, Donald Sutherland, Sissy Spacek, Gary Oldman, Walter Matthau, Jack Lemmon, Michael Rooker, Kevin Bacon, John Candy and many more. How Stone managed to handle this many stars proves his strength as a director.Anyway, the commentary covers everything. The filmmaking, the writing, the politics, justifications of excluding certain events, scenes and characters and he responds to each criticism of his film and makes the people who voiced them look like idiots. And Stone is not like a monosyllabic Tim Burton (whose commentaries can be so boring and painful at times). He speaks with an articulacy that is rare among any Hollywood director. He is an educated man whose intelligence overwhelms the listener. He ends on an ambiguous tone. He questions my generation (I am 18). He asks if I am an institutionalised consumer in a capitalist society who blindly accepts the information fed by the media. That is DEEP! Stone's intention in this film was to elevate the importance of the JFK assassination. To show how a country that was once founded on the greatest of ideals allowed such a horror to occur. It is also a very relevant commentary as the face of Lee Harvey Oswald could easily be replaced by the face of Osama Bin Laden.I thought the Fincher/Pitt commentaries were good but Stone puts them to shame. This director has proved to me that film still matters, that it is a serious medium which can make serious changes in the world.

I guess that is neither here nor there, but I would have loved to see what Stone's theory on those episodes were.Now, as far as the BD itself is concerned, the picture is true HD, although it does not look spectacular in the beginning due to artistic purposes, but as the color comes in, the quality also does as well.  The sound IS HD and you can hear the clear different switching from Dolby to Dolby TrueHD.I am not too crazy about these book cases, but since this film is now almost 20 years old (hard to believe!), the book help to recall some things that were forgotten when this was coming out.I noticed in the film that the Paines and Johnny Carson were left out of the film.  I assume it has to do with legal matters.  While Costner's performance won rave reviews, it would have been nicer if he tried to mimic Garrion's voice, which seems easy enough to do.This of course is a must have film, especially if you are into history and while we wait for the government to develop a good excuse for what really happened when they let us know.

Martin Luther King's &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech and finally JFK's assassination in 1963. What do these things have in common? They're moments in history that everyone remembers, researches and studies. So much has happened in the past 100 years but these events and others just like it actually happened and they're part of American history. The difference between the assassination and the rest? It's a controversy, it's a mystery. It's something that can't be explained unlike the others.November 22nd, 1963. Dallas, Texas. Dealey Plaza. President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in his motorcade during a visit. The suspect: Lee Harvey Oswald. The main investigator: Jim Garrison. The film follows Garrison and his investigation into the assassination and what proves to be the mystery of all mysteries.This film will make you think. Why? Because the explanation by the government(called the Magic Bullet Theory, your first clue that the government had something to do with it) is wrong, and they explain why. Why Oswald could not have performed the shooting alone and they explain why. Director Oliver Stone delves deep into this and literally rips things apart. A lot of it is speculation and theories but that's the whole point, to keep you thinking and to raise questions.All in all, a controversial but brilliantly constructed attempt to show that what happened that day near 40 years ago is deeper and more complicated than what you were told by the big boys in Washington",5,One of those films that WILL make you think,1064880000,"09 30, 2003",2003,1561,"['Lunar', 'Landing', 'Hindenburg', 'Stock', 'market', 'crash', '1929', 'Titanic', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'King', 'quot', 'Have', 'Dream', 'quot', 'speech', 'finally', 'JFK', 'assassination', '1963', 'What', 'do', 'things', 'have', 'common', ""'re"", 'moments', 'history', 'everyone', 'remembers', 'researches', 'studies', 'So', 'much', 'happened', 'past', '100', 'years', 'events', 'others', 'just', 'actually', 'happened', ""'re"", 'part', 'American', 'history', 'difference', 'assassination', 'rest', 'controversy', 'mystery', 'something', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'explained', 'others.November', '22nd', '1963', 'Dallas', 'Texas', 'Dealey', 'Plaza', 'President', 'John', 'F.', 'Kennedy', 'was', 'assassinated', 'motorcade', 'visit', 'suspect', 'Lee', 'Harvey', 'Oswald', 'main', 'investigator', 'Jim', 'Garrison', 'film', 'Garrison', 'investigation', 'assassination', 'what', 'be', 'mystery', 'mysteries.This', 'film', 'will', 'make', 'think', 'Why', 'explanation', 'government', 'called', 'Magic', 'Bullet', 'Theory', 'first', 'clue', 'government', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'wrong', 'explain', 'why', 'Why', 'Oswald', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'performed', 'shooting', 'alone', 'explain', 'why', 'Director', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'deep', 'literally', 'rips', 'things', 'apart', 'lot', 'speculation', 'theories', 'whole', 'point', 'keep', 'thinking', 'raise', 'questions.All', 'controversial', 'brilliantly', 'constructed', 'attempt', 'show', 'what', 'happened', 'day', '40', 'years', 'ago', 'deeper', 'more', 'complicated', 'what', 'were', 'told', 'big', 'boys', 'Washington']",JFK Director's Cut
93203,A51IK68MWKV5R,0790729733,"Craig Clarke ""Somebody Dies""","[22, 25]","It has been said that JFK is Oliver Stone's favorite of his films, and I can understand why. In many ways, it is his best. It is certainly his most ambitious. Even if taken only in terms of its visuals and editing, this was an ambitious undertaking. And he's taken it a step further. He has taken the dry minutiae (whether you can give a label of ""hard facts"" is debatable) and not only kept it from being boring, but has also made it compelling, gripping cinema. Three hours go by without a yawn.Culled from two major sources--On the Trail of the Assassins by Jim Garrison (who is the lead character played by Kevin Costner) and Crossfire by Jim Marrs--as well as other governmental records and his own interviews, JFK is an almost complete picture of what information was available at the time.Also involved in the film's riveting status is the all-star cast Stone has hired to portray important characters. A listing of actors in this film includes: Tommy Lee Jones, Joe Pesci, Sissy Spacek, Kevin Bacon, Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, John Candy, and Gary Oldman. Donald Sutherland (playing ""X,"" a character based on Fletcher Prouty) gives a ten-minute monologue that should have been dull as dishwater, but it is so chock-full of information combined with intercut dramatizations and John Williams stunning score, that it is a pivotal (and my favorite) scene in the movie.There is so much information involved here that it could have easily become confusing or overwhelming but Stone and co-screenwriter Zachary Sklar have assembled the pieces in a narrative form--often having the information come out in the form of character interviews--and doesn't talk down to its audience. Also, the mix of film types--grainy documentary-like footage, differences in lighting and colored filters mixed with footage from the Zapruder film--was surely a step toward the making of Natural Born Killers a scant few years later.My only question lies in Kevin Costner's performance as New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison. He gives his normal measured performance, but, apart from a workable Louisiana accent, never really delves into the character. Perhaps this is deliberate. After all, Garrison is only the means Stone uses to tell his story (putting other people's theories in the character's mouth along the way), so why wouldn't the actor playing him be just as much of a conduit? A familiar face that we have come to trust through his relationships with other quality films playing a man who we need to trust for the film to work. If this is so, it also explains the stunt casting of the key personalities: give us familiar faces so we don't have to learn new identities, we can just take what we know of their past performances and subconsciously layer that over the new ones.I could keep going on but suffice to say that JFK is one of my favorite films and I recommend it highly as entertainment--regardless of what you think about the cause of the assassination.(Other good reading on the subject is Don DeLillo's novel Libra, which suggests that Lee Harvey Oswald was hired to pull off an unsuccessful attempt on the president in order to blame it on Cuba and warn Kennedy to change his administration's relationship with that country.)",5,One of the best films of the 1990's,1043280000,"01 23, 2003",2003,3239,"['been', 'said', 'JFK', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'favorite', 'films', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'many', 'ways', 'best', 'certainly', 'most', 'ambitious', 'Even', 'taken', 'only', 'terms', 'visuals', 'editing', 'was', 'ambitious', 'undertaking', 'taken', 'step', 'further', 'taken', 'dry', 'minutiae', 'can', 'give', 'label', 'hard', 'facts', 'debatable', 'not', 'only', 'kept', 'being', 'boring', 'also', 'made', 'compelling', 'gripping', 'cinema', 'Three', 'hours', 'go', 'yawn.Culled', 'two', 'major', 'sources', 'Trail', 'Assassins', 'Jim', 'Garrison', 'who', 'lead', 'character', 'played', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'Crossfire', 'Jim', 'Marrs', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'governmental', 'records', 'own', 'interviews', 'JFK', 'almost', 'complete', 'picture', 'what', 'information', 'was', 'available', 'time.Also', 'involved', 'film', 'riveting', 'status', 'all-star', 'cast', 'Stone', 'hired', 'portray', 'important', 'characters', 'listing', 'actors', 'film', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'Joe', 'Pesci', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'Walter', 'Matthau', 'John', 'Candy', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'playing', 'X', 'character', 'based', 'Fletcher', 'Prouty', 'ten-minute', 'monologue', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'dull', 'dishwater', 'so', 'chock-full', 'information', 'combined', 'intercut', 'dramatizations', 'John', 'Williams', 'stunning', 'score', 'pivotal', 'favorite', 'scene', 'movie.There', 'so', 'much', 'information', 'involved', 'here', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'become', 'confusing', 'overwhelming', 'Stone', 'co-screenwriter', 'Zachary', 'Sklar', 'have', 'assembled', 'pieces', 'narrative', 'form', 'often', 'having', 'information', 'come', 'out', 'form', 'character', 'interviews', ""n't"", 'talk', 'down', 'audience', 'Also', 'mix', 'film', 'types', 'grainy', 'documentary-like', 'footage', 'differences', 'lighting', 'colored', 'filters', 'mixed', 'footage', 'Zapruder', 'film', 'was', 'surely', 'step', 'making', 'Natural', 'Born', 'Killers', 'scant', 'few', 'years', 'only', 'question', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'performance', 'New', 'Orleans', 'District', 'Attorney', 'Jim', 'Garrison', 'normal', 'measured', 'performance', 'apart', 'workable', 'Louisiana', 'accent', 'never', 'really', 'character', 'Perhaps', 'deliberate', 'Garrison', 'only', 'means', 'Stone', 'tell', 'story', 'putting', 'other', 'people', 'theories', 'character', 'mouth', 'way', 'so', 'why', 'would', ""n't"", 'actor', 'playing', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'conduit', 'familiar', 'face', 'have', 'come', 'trust', 'relationships', 'other', 'quality', 'films', 'playing', 'man', 'who', 'need', 'trust', 'film', 'work', 'so', 'also', 'stunt', 'casting', 'key', 'personalities', 'give', 'familiar', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'learn', 'new', 'identities', 'can', 'just', 'take', 'what', 'know', 'past', 'performances', 'subconsciously', 'new', 'ones.I', 'could', 'keep', 'going', 'suffice', 'say', 'JFK', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'recommend', 'highly', 'entertainment', 'regardless', 'what', 'think', 'cause', 'assassination', 'Other', 'good', 'reading', 'subject', 'Don', 'DeLillo', 'novel', 'Libra', 'Lee', 'Harvey', 'Oswald', 'was', 'hired', 'pull', 'off', 'unsuccessful', 'attempt', 'president', 'order', 'blame', 'Cuba', 'warn', 'Kennedy', 'change', 'administration', 'relationship', 'country']",JFK Director's Cut

Previous incarnations included a movie-only edition spread over two sides of a single disc and an extras-packed two DVD set, part of the Oliver Stone Collection that came out a few years ago. What's new on this one? Aside from all the extras from the last version, only a feature-length documentary and that's it.All of the extras on the previous edition are included as is one new addition, a 90-minute documentary entitled, ""Beyond JFK: The Question of Conspiracy."" It uses Stone's film as a jumping off point in which to revisit the events of and surrounding the assassination and examine the cult of conspiracy theorists. There is some fantastic on the set footage of Stone in action and interviews with most of the star-studded cast. Detractors of the film (Walter Cronkite and a film critic from The New York Times) and its supporters (Robert MacNeil from the MacNeil/Lehr Report) are interviewed, providing an excellent snapshot of the controversy that swirled around the film at the time. This is an excellent, in-depth documentary that even includes interviews with Marina Oswald and fascinating archival footage of the real Oswald, including his infamous death on live TV at the hands of Jack Ruby.For casual fans of the film who already own the Oliver Stone Collection version, buying this new one probably isn't really worth it. For hardcore fans of JFK and Stone, the inclusion of this impressive documentary is worth the price of purchase. For completists, however, one glaring omission is AMC's excellent episode of Backstory that was done on the making of the film. Perhaps this will be included on yet another future edition of this film. That being said, this is a solid two DVD set for a landmark film.

93209,A1R8AO9XASQ15C,0790729733,Daniel A. Marsh,"[4, 5]","Oliver Stone's &quot;JFK&quot; is a brave, powerful, radical film. It's also scary as hell. The movie explores our collective national nightmare about the assassination of the President and its potential links to Castro, the Mob, the CIA, and of course Vietnam and the Military-Industrial Complex. It does not merely suggest that a great evil befell our country that horrible day in 1963, but shouts it from the rooftops. How Stone ever got this movie made is beyond me. But I'm glad he did.&quot;JFK&quot; is first and foremost a movie. It is not a documentary and it is not journalism. I agree with critics and others who find its value in its willingness to confront such a difficult subject and exhort its audience to question authority, use their &quot;eyes and ears and good sense.&quot; Did Oliver Stone convince me that Lee Harvey Oswald did not, in fact, act alone -- that none other than Lyndon Johnson and military defense contractors were in fact behind the assassination? Not necessarily. But this movie intrigued me and scared me and got me to thinking, and that is really the highest compliment I can pay a Hollywood film. Most movies are interested in only one thing: money. This one is interested in ideas, enlightenment, and seeking out the truth. That alone makes &quot;JFK&quot; a rarity.Besides all that, it's a terrific piece of filmmaking, period. I'm not a big fan of Oliver Stone, but what he pulled off here is remarkable. &quot;JFK&quot; feels like a combination of Hitchcock and Spielberg, with maybe a little Brian De Palma and Frank Capra thrown in. From the photography to the sound to the editing, it's a masterwork, vivid and alive. Though there is a lot of dialogue -- and two scenes that amount to soliloquies of Shakespearean depth -- Stone never bogs down, never loses steam, never loses his train of thought. The whole movie builds up to a climactic courtroom sequence that pulls all the threads together into a picture of what MIGHT have happened in Dallas that day. It then leaves us to think, and ask questions, and keep our own eyes open.I want to mention three of the actors. First, Tommy Lee Jones, who is seductively evil as Clay Shaw/Bertrand. He deserved to win the Best Supporting Actor Oscar that year, but of course there's no justice in that ceremony. Second, Joe Pesci, panicky and devilish as David Ferrie -- here's a whirlwind performance that dwarfs his fast-talking work in &quot;Lethal Weapon 2.&quot; Finally, Kevin Costner, turning in a powerful portrayal of Jim Garrison. Costner is in almost every scene, sometimes just watching and listening, but always credible in a role that took a lot of guts for him to play (after all, he is Stone's mouthpiece for a lot of highly unpopular ideas). Anyone who doubts Costner's acting ability has obviously never seen this film.There are disturbing moments, many of them highlighted by pungent dialogue that gets right to the point. Donald Sutherland gets the movie's most gripping scene, walking Costner through all of &quot;the facts&quot; behind the assassination (it's a brilliant scene -- Garrison almost literally shuts down, he's so overwhelmed by what he's hearing). Lines like &quot;subtle as a cockroach crawling across a white carpet,&quot; &quot;it's a mystery wrapped in a riddle inside an enigma&quot; and &quot;people like you just walk between the raindrops&quot; have a strangely chilling effect; simple lines that cast the drama in a sinister light.Look, I realize that Stone altered some of the facts to fit his cinematic story (Ferrie, for instance, did not die under such suspicious circumstances). I know that the movie is not unbiased -- that it's a bald representation of the ideas of the man behind it. So what? Here is a movie that takes more risks than any other, before or since. It has flaws, but they are minor. &quot;JFK&quot; was the best film of 1991 and stands as one of my favorites ... disturbing though it may be.",5,"Frightening, disturbing",1071446400,"12 15, 2003",2003,3950,"['Oliver', 'Stone', 'quot', 'JFK', 'quot', 'brave', 'powerful', 'radical', 'film', 'also', 'scary', 'hell', 'movie', 'collective', 'national', 'nightmare', 'assassination', 'President', 'potential', 'links', 'Castro', 'Mob', 'CIA', 'course', 'Vietnam', 'Military-Industrial', 'Complex', 'not', 'merely', 'suggest', 'great', 'evil', 'country', 'horrible', 'day', '1963', 'rooftops', 'How', 'Stone', 'ever', 'got', 'movie', 'made', ""'m"", 'glad', 'quot', 'JFK', 'quot', 'first', 'foremost', 'movie', 'not', 'documentary', 'not', 'journalism', 'agree', 'critics', 'others', 'who', 'find', 'value', 'willingness', 'confront', 'difficult', 'subject', 'exhort', 'audience', 'question', 'authority', 'use', 'quot', 'eyes', 'ears', 'good', 'sense.', 'quot', 'Did', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'convince', 'Lee', 'Harvey', 'Oswald', 'did', 'not', 'fact', 'act', 'alone', 'none', 'other', 'Lyndon', 'Johnson', 'military', 'defense', 'contractors', 'were', 'fact', 'assassination', 'Not', 'necessarily', 'movie', 'intrigued', 'scared', 'got', 'thinking', 'really', 'highest', 'compliment', 'can', 'pay', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'Most', 'movies', 'are', 'interested', 'only', 'one', 'thing', 'money', 'one', 'interested', 'ideas', 'enlightenment', 'seeking', 'out', 'truth', 'alone', 'quot', 'JFK', 'quot', 'terrific', 'piece', 'filmmaking', 'period', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'what', 'pulled', 'off', 'here', 'remarkable', 'quot', 'JFK', 'quot', 'feels', 'combination', 'Hitchcock', 'Spielberg', 'maybe', 'little', 'Brian', 'De', 'Palma', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'thrown', 'photography', 'sound', 'editing', 'masterwork', 'vivid', 'alive', 'lot', 'dialogue', 'two', 'scenes', 'amount', 'soliloquies', 'Shakespearean', 'depth', 'Stone', 'never', 'bogs', 'down', 'never', 'steam', 'never', 'train', 'thought', 'whole', 'movie', 'up', 'climactic', 'courtroom', 'sequence', 'threads', 'together', 'picture', 'what', 'MIGHT', 'have', 'happened', 'Dallas', 'day', 'then', 'think', 'ask', 'questions', 'keep', 'own', 'eyes', 'open.I', 'want', 'mention', 'three', 'actors', 'First', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'who', 'seductively', 'evil', 'Clay', 'Shaw/Bertrand', 'deserved', 'win', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Oscar', 'year', 'course', 'justice', 'ceremony', 'Second', 'Joe', 'Pesci', 'panicky', 'devilish', 'David', 'Ferrie', 'here', 'whirlwind', 'performance', 'fast-talking', 'work', 'quot', 'Lethal', 'Weapon', '2.', 'quot', 'Finally', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'turning', 'powerful', 'portrayal', 'Jim', 'Garrison', 'Costner', 'almost', 'scene', 'sometimes', 'just', 'watching', 'listening', 'always', 'credible', 'role', 'took', 'lot', 'guts', 'play', 'Stone', 'mouthpiece', 'lot', 'highly', 'unpopular', 'ideas', 'Anyone', 'who', 'Costner', 'acting', 'ability', 'obviously', 'never', 'seen', 'are', 'disturbing', 'moments', 'many', 'highlighted', 'pungent', 'dialogue', 'right', 'point', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'movie', 'most', 'gripping', 'scene', 'walking', 'Costner', 'quot', 'facts', 'quot', 'assassination', 'brilliant', 'scene', 'Garrison', 'almost', 'literally', 'shuts', 'down', 'so', 'overwhelmed', 'what', 'hearing', 'Lines', 'quot', 'cockroach', 'crawling', 'white', 'carpet', 'quot', 'quot', 'mystery', 'wrapped', 'riddle', 'enigma', 'quot', 'quot', 'people', 'just', 'walk', 'raindrops', 'quot', 'have', 'strangely', 'chilling', 'effect', 'simple', 'lines', 'cast', 'drama', 'sinister', 'light.Look', 'realize', 'Stone', 'altered', 'facts', 'fit', 'cinematic', 'story', 'Ferrie', 'instance', 'did', 'not', 'die', 'such', 'suspicious', 'circumstances', 'know', 'movie', 'not', 'unbiased', 'bald', 'representation', 'ideas', 'man', 'So', 'what', 'Here', 'movie', 'more', 'risks', 'other', 'flaws', 'are', 'minor', 'quot', 'JFK', 'quot', 'was', 'best', 'film', '1991', 'one', 'favorites', 'disturbing', 'may', 'be']",JFK Director's Cut
93210,A1SD82ZAT3INZ2,0790729733,Daniel Hayes,"[1, 2]","I have this on DVD, and it's a terrific film that tells about one of the tragedies in American History. November 22, 1963 was the end of the innocence of this country when President Kennedy was assassinated. I wasn't alive at the time, but I've seen alot of footage surrounding this tragedy. I feel that there's cause for both sides....the one where the Warren Report said that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in the killing of Kennedy, and the theory that's presented here that there was a second shooter. I honestly don't know how far a bullet can travel from M-1 rifle which I believed Oswald used, so it's possible that Oswald could've been the lone killer considering he was a sharpshooter in the Marines. I also think that there's creedence to there being a second shooter as the film shows the footage of Kennedy's motorcade, and one of the shots looks as though it hits Kennedy by his ear which to me would've been a hard shot for Oswald to pull off from where he positioned himself, so that opens up the possibility that someone stationed closer to ground as it looks like it's a side shot from the grassy knoll, or possibly behind it. As to who actually could've done this besides Oswald may never surface, and I saw an episode on the History Channel where it's been asserted that director Oliver Stone manipulated the footage of Kennedy's motorcade to show that Kennedy was assassinated by someone else. The History Channel asserts that Stone speeded up the footage to add a few extra frames. I assert that perhaps there was someone behind the grassy knoll, and possibly fired a rifle when he heard one go off, but that asks the question if there is another shooter who fired first? This may never be solved in this lifetime.The actual story within this movie is about the lone trial in which someone is tried for having connections to Kennedy's Assassination, and the actual outcome of the trial was that he was found ""Not Guilty"", so that closes the lone attempt to find out the mystery surrounding the murder of President Kennedy. There are still alot of theories out there, but nothing to bring it all together. The film had an all-star crew ranging from John Candy to Kevin Costner. There was also memorable performances from Donald Sutherland, Joe Pesci, John Larroqutte, Sissy Spacek, and Jack Lemmon, and Walter Matthau.

93211,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,0790729733,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[5, 6]","You have to approach Oliver Stone's JFK in two ways: first as a motion picture, then as a representation of history.  It is often hard to separate the two, but one must never forget that this is a movie, a dramatization that features a number of added fictional elements to make it more poignant and gripping.  How true a representation of Garrison's life and work is this?  I can't say for sure, as I have focused most of my attention on the work and ideas of a number of other dedicated researchers, having always regarded Garrison's case as tangential at best.  Garrison, even with a little fictional help from Oliver Stone, never had much of a case against Clay Shaw, but the evidence he puts forth in his unwinnable case does, to my mind, satisfactorily prove that there was a conspiracy involving unknown individuals to kill the President.  Still, though, this is an over dramatized production wherein a number of facts are tweaked, created, changed, or deleted; Garrison is a controversial figure who comes off much better here than he does in real life, so one can certainly not accept this film as fact.  I have read and studied the JFK assassination at some length, and I consider Garrison's case an interesting but rather small, gnarled limb on the tree of conspiracy; there are a number of far larger and weightier limbs on that tree, and when these are eventually hacked down and fall at the foot of the American people, the whole world will be rocked by the force and immensity of the event, and the reverberations of that fall will echo throughout all of our future history.JFK succeeds admirably as a movie.  The blending together of actual footage and historical re-creations in a sometimes almost surreal way is very effective, the humanity, passion, and integrity of Jim Garrison shines out like a beacon of truth, and Garrison's passionate closing argument is emotionally powerful and believable.  The film is rather graphic, but it has to be.  One of the reasons I bought this movie when it came out was its inclusion of the Zapruder film, the key piece of evidence that, among other things, shows the horrible force and destruction of the kill shot.  Autopsy scenes and photos, both real and re-created, may also be disturbing to some, but they are historically accurate.  The film features an incredible number of well-known actors and actresses: Kevin Costner, whom I don't really like as a general rule, delivers a truly powerful performance; Sissy Spacek is certainly convincing as Garrison's annoying, emotionally torn wife; Brian Doyle-Murray makes a convincing Jack Ruby; and Gary Oldman simply is Lee Harvey Oswald.  An almost unrecognizable Tommy Lee Jones brings Clay Shaw to memorable life, but the finest performance here, in my opinion, is that of Joe Pesci in his role of the unforgettable real-life character David Ferrie.  Great actors such as Ed Asner, Jack Lemmon, Donald Sutherland, John Candy, Walter Matthau, and Kevin Bacon are brilliant in small yet important roles.  Jim Garrison himself even makes an appearance as, of all people, Earl Warren.JFK doesn't have very many answers, but it asks a lot of the right questions.  The one problem this film has, though, is the fact that it covers so much information and characters.  Those who have not studied the assassination in any depth before, those who have not read such material as Stone drew heavily from (principally Jim Marrs' Crossfire and the research of Robert Groden), may find themselves a little overwhelmed by too much information, much of it presented in the form of rapid-fire dialogue and dream-like video montages.This movie, much like Garrison's case, spread the word to the public at large; it exposed the shadows of dark, mysterious forces whose possible connection to the assassination has never been fully explored; it tore down the incredibly shaky conclusion of the Warren Commission; it pointed fingers not so much at individuals and groups of possible conspirators as it pointed the finger of truth at the American public.  We all deserve to know the truth about Kennedy's assassination, and it is up to us to demand and get that proof, to tear down the walls of secrecy and confidentiality behind which what is left of the evidence lies, to take our country back from the kinds of men who would engineer a brutal public murder and then secretly change the entire course of our great republic for the worse.  I think that anyone who looks at this case will know that the government has lied to us all for the past forty years.  That's not really the point of this film, though.  JFK compels you to look at the evidence yourself, it exhorts you not to take the government at its word without sufficient proof, and it expresses the qualities a great nation must rediscover if it is to prosper in the future.",5,"A powerful, important, but not wholly factual movie",1069459200,"11 22, 2003",2003,4825,"['have', 'approach', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'JFK', 'two', 'ways', 'first', 'motion',

93212,A2HII4U9WQ0XUV,0790729733,"Dark Mechanicus JSG ""Black Ops Teep""","[1, 4]","Stop the tape a minute, tell Mr. Zapruder to put down his camera, get comfy beside me here on this nice grassy knoll, and ignore that guy with the umbrella---he's probably one of ours---and let's ask one of the great, burning questions of our age:Is Oliver Stone's ""JFK"" worth a watch?Absolutely!---but you don't need to convene the Warren Commission to tell you that. Oliver Stone serves up a typically kinetic, visually arresting, deliciously conspiratorial and roaringly over-the-top film in ""JFK"", in which you're best served to worry less about historical authenticity, and just sit back and enjoy the movie for the feat of cinematic virtuosity that it is.Right from the start, Stone leaps in with style, wit, a well-equipped army of solid ensemble actors, and a crack team of skilled editors helmed up by his faithful Director of Photography Robert Richardson (who has worked on all of Stone's projects, from ""Wall Street"" to ""Natural Born Killers""); Stone digs in from the beginning and goes to work with the aplomb of a natural---and gifted---storyteller.Stone has a little help from his friends, to be sure: Jim Marrs, (who wrote ""Crossfire: The Plot that Killed Kennedy"") and the still-crusading Jim Garrison (the New Orleans DA who wrote ""On the Trail of the Assassins"" and even appears in the film as his old nemesis, former Supreme Court Justice Earl Warren!) worked with Stone on the screenplay.That ""JFK"" is a work of passion is quite evident, and redounds to the credit of its screenwriters. That it is a work of somewhat dubious historical authenticity is, alas, not so evident---and again, that is due to the cinematic wizardry Stone works in putting you on Dealey Plaza on that sultry Dallas afternoon 40 years ago. But like the best New Orleans gumbo, it's not what's in the stew that counts, it's how it tastes---and this gumbo tastes mighty fine!All of this style and substance is put at the service of a contention that seems an article of faith by Stone: that President Kennedy was cut down not by a raving Marxist madman with a grudge and a mail-order rifle, but by a shadowy cabal of politicians and industrialists entrenched in the very highest levels of American government.""JFK"" puts you at the side of young New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison(played adroitly by Kevin Costner in one of his best performances), who, four years after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, begins to delive into a sordid underground of New Orleans tycoons and orgiasts, spies and con-men, Cuban exiles and CIA spooks, mercenaries and mobsters.His suspicion aroused, Garrison reorganizes his office into a single-minded legal SWAT team designed to investigate the shadowy New Orleans bon vivant ""Clay Bertrand"", who may have had a hand in a conspiracy to kill President Kennedy---and to not only question the findings of the Warren Report, but to launch an investigation into the complicity of the White House into the death of the former president.For all of its political immediacy and slick cinematographic techniques, ""JFK"" is more sweaty Southern potboiler than stern Yankee conspiracy theory, owing far more to sultry Faulknerian southern town mysteries and the forbidden, sweltering interludes of Tennessee Williams. Stone uses every resource at his disposal to ratchet up an atmosphere of oppression and menace: characters don't just talk, they sweat rivers, their eyes dart nervously about, they pace like caged tigers, the camera tracking their edgy, jerky movements.All of this is supported by impeccable acting: ""JFK"" is studded with top-drawer talent, most of whom engage in a feeding frenzy of scene-chewing. Costner is given a foil in Tommy Lee Jones at his most sardonic as the elegant and poised Clay Shaw, who exudes menace in even the most genteel purr. Kevin Bacon is creepy, sinister, and volatile as Garrison's useless 'witness' Willie O'Keefe, while Joe Pesci lets the hairpiece do the acting as the unstable David Ferrie. Jack Lemmon anticipates his ""Glengarry"" act as Jack Martin, condemned to be forever pistol-whipped by a hulking Ed Asner (who plays the bilious, mysterious Guy Bannister); John Candy literally sweats bullets, hides behind his Ray-Bans, and chomps a cigar. And what conspiracy theory movie is complete without an obligatory appearance by Donald Sutherland as the mysterious Agent X?All of this works some powerful ju-ju: the movie is spookier than a decrepit New Orleans antebellum plantation at midnight, and spicier than a pot of gumbo. The new Director's Cut restores 17 minutes of material left cut from the theatrical run, and the new bits both reinforce and detract from the power of the original. On the plus side, we get a little more of the tactics used by Garrison's shadowy enemies to knock him off the trail of the assassins, including one of his creepier close calls at the New Orleans airport. On the down side, the restored sequence featuring Garrison on a campy, kitschy talk-show hosted by John LaRoquette feels like nails on a chalkboard; it plays like parody, and does nothing but detract from the seriousness and pacing of the film.If ""JFK"" raises questions about one of the more dubious and traumatic periods of our collective American memory, that's well and good---though the viewer should beware: Stone plays fast and loose with the historical record. But in building up an account of the assassination, Stone has created a modern masterpiece, a film that transcends the limitations of its subject and produces a creepy-crawly classic.",5,Night of the

93214,A31LHED3SKLWVB,0790729733,Darren,"[3, 4]","Renewed interest in this movie, and, in fact, the whole subject, as we bear down on the 50th anniversary of that terrible day in Dallas.  Stone has received a lot of venomous criticism over the years for getting some details wrong, but bear in mind that he never said we was telling the ""real story"" of the assassination.  By his own admission, ""JFK"" is more of a fantasia on the divers possible motives for conspiracy.  Where Stone gets it right is in exposing the appalling behavior of the U.S. Government generally, and the Warren Commission specifically, when it came to the investigation of this murder.  Evidence not fitting a preconceived expectation was simply eschewed.  Witnesses who told stories that didn't fit the ""agreed-upon narrative"" weren't even called up to testify.  One also wonders why the government was and is shocked that many didn't believe and still don't believe the official narrative when Zapruder's video evidence of a frontal shot, combined with the government's utterly paranoid refusal to release non-redacted documents until the year 10,000 A.D. or whenever, simply encourages conspiracy-mongering.Basically, saying that ""JFK"" isn't the ""real story"" is just building a strawman argument.  Criticizing the rather egregious Jim Garrison is also beside the point.  If Stone was a a true believer in Garrison, he wouldn't have taken us on so many detours, particularly the road leading to ""X"" (Donald Sutherland performing a bravura 15-minute monologue).  In terms of the actual movie, Garrison is constructed as our Everyman, trying to understand what happened.  As such, the design succeeds.Finally, the movie forced a reluctant government to once again release even more documents in 1992 -- it was called the ""JFK Records Collection Act"".  Bottom line?  The movie advanced the cause of truth, even if the movie itself wasn't always truthful.  Sounds pretty worthwhile to me.  Certainly earns this movie the right to be called a ""milestone"".For the record, I may as well say that I don't believe there was a concrete conspiracy.  I do believe, however, that Kennedy was never seriously dissuaded from his preferred policy of security relaxation.  I suspect that many within the Military Industrial Complex were going, ""Oh please, oh please"" whenever he sat in an open-air limousine.  I also believe they were well aware of the presence in Dallas of a disturbed former defector to Russia who would be sitting in a virtual birds' nest over the motorcade route.  And here's what I know for a fact: the ""lone gunman"" theory is just that: a theory, like all the others.  Oswald was never tried in a court of law.The question really is, who helped him from behind the fnece?  That, we'll never know, just as we'll never know what Kennedy's brain would put to rest in terms of forensic evidence, because the brain in STOLEN.

Here's why......--------------------If a Nobel Prize for movie screenplays resulting in incredible movie results were awarded, the writers of the ""JFK"" (1991) screenplay should get the first one..........Here are the official screenplay credits for ""JFK (1991) starring Kevin Costner: Oliver Stone (screenplay) Zachary Sklar (screenplay) based on the Jim Garrison book ""On the Trail of the Assassins"" and the Jim Marrs book ""Crossfire: The Plot That Killed Kennedy"" Two screen writers who used two books to fashion a truly hypnotic screenplay resulting in a wonderful, satisfying, riveting movie.""There are no good movies without good screenplays"" saith the movie god sage, and this often repeated in ""How To Write Good Screenplays"" type books, of which there are many (many worth reading).How true! The current (2013) fashion and mania and center stage status of comic book, superhero ""action"" movies packed with special effects and computer generated images (CGI's!) is all about the LACK of good screen writing available to the movie industry, which serves a huge and profitable market (aka the world wide audience reading and willing to pay big money for the distraction from their awful lives provided by a good, entertaining movie), and substitutes video game type psychedelica (both visual and audio images and sounds) to dazzle without the need for mental logic or coherent ideas.Well......good screenplays are hard to come by, always were.The ""JFK"" (1991) screenplay resulted in a wonderful, magnetic, riveting movie packed with long, long, long compelling monologues delivered by wonderful, verbally capable actors (Kevin Costner, Donald Sutherland, others) which ""action heroes"" of fame and note (e.g. Clint Eastwood, bless him) could never have, and will never deliver.Clint, even in his 80's, can jump out of windows and slug bad guys, but he can't provide articulate, sustained intelligent long, long monologues filled with polysyllabic words and complex but logical ideas which go on and and on and on..and keep us all on the edge of our seats, and make us grateful we were lucky enough to see a great movie with almost NO ""action"" and visual crutches the ""no ideas"" ""silent super hero"" movies based on Marvel Comics types shove at us in current times (2013).Only well educated and articulate actors can ""talk the talk"" and present long, intelligent arguments, and ""JFK"" (1991) does that well, to it's credit.For those who don't know, ""JFK"" (1991) is a Kennedy assassination conspiracy movie based on Jim Garrison's assertions, legal actions, and book with help from yet another Kennedy assassination conspiracy book..What the brilliant Oliver Stone and his co-authors have done is simple and wonderful.They have taken a ""single issue"" argument and ""cause"" well known to the public and famous everywhere, and made a movie consisting of long, long monologues presenting in logical and articulate detail various related arguments in such zealous detail, any lawyer advocate of ability would be dazzled.And dazzled we, the audience, are....by this movie and it's simple device......logical long monologues presented by well equipped (for monologues) actors which are implicitly dramatic and appealing.""Single issue"" causes (such as the Kennedy assassination conspiracy arguments) are dramatic and satisfying.They provide the audience with a good time for the same reason a good football game provides good times to onlookers.Logic, oddly, has very little to do with it all.""Single issue"" causes not seriously challenged or contradicted (the case in ""JFK"" 1991) SEEM logical and deliver a delicious satisfaction to the audience.This has nothing to do with whether or not the ""cause"" presented is worthy or whether the conclusions advocated are accurate and true.It's all about the psychological satisfaction of hearing a good one sided case well presented which we've all heard about before, and can never know about completely....nobody can for most famous ""single issue"" causes of fame.And there are many, many, MANY ""single issue causes"" of fame over history which could ALSO be presented in movie form using the techniques of screen writing used in ""JFK"" (1991), which would make incredibly successful and satisfying movies (again, let us emphasize that logic has little to do with emotional and mental satisfaction...a good ""single issue"" movie filled with monologues must avoid on-screen challenges to the case it presents....the fact it's one sided is what will make it a successful movie!Richard Hofstader's brilliant book titled ""The Paranoid Style In American Politics"" (1952 Harvard U. Press) discusses the fame and success of single issue causes (and books supporting the causes which became best sellers) in a book chapter about William Hope Harvey's ""Coin's Financial School"" (1890's) book advocating ""Free Silver"" and bi-bimetallism....big single issue cause in the 1890s....William Jennings Bryan based his USA Presidential 1896 campaign on it).Hofstadter also mentions other 19th century ""single cause"" books of fame in passing, including Maria Monk's 1836 ""Awful Disclosures Of The Hotel Dieu Nunnery Of Montreal"" anti-Catholic book, and ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" anti-Negro slavery book, both widely popular ""single cause"" advocacy books of huge fame and profit for book publishers.Hofstadter states, rightly, that single cause writing (which the ""JFK"" 1991 screenplay definitely is) is successful due to ""the fierce logic of the one-idea mind, the firm conviction that complex social issues can be unraveled to the last point, that social problems can really be solved, and solved by simple means."" The back up materials which can feed a movie screenplay of the ""JFK"" (1991) type are copious and available almost in tidal wave proportions.So much has been written (much of it well written in clear, skilled, logical, easy to understand, plausible, logical prose) to support the various single issue causes scattered over history (from the lost continent of Atlantis to the Yellow Peril scare of the 19th and 20th centuries!), creating an Oliver Stone/ Zachary Sklar/ Jim Garrison type screenplay, and getting the same good results (and good movie) the ""JFK"" (1991) screenplay got would be easy.What is Hollywood waiting for? It's time for more ""single issue causes"" movies with many long, long monologues delivered by good actors......The movie makers will get rich, and the lucky audiences will be endlessly

This film is a veritable ""Melting Pot of Plots"".A logical question to ask would be: How could so many different people, agencies, and organizations possibly ALL be involved in such a massive assassination plot and never have anybody from any of these agencies leak any information? Such widespread theorizing is utter nonsense, IMO. I guess Mr. Stone just wanted to touch every possible base, and throw in the kitchen sink, to boot. :-)There's a point in the film which has Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) and his staff, while eating dinner in a restaurant, coming up with conspiracy theories seemingly out of thin air and off the tops of their heads. Mr. Garrison seems to be taking assassin Lee Harvey Oswald at his word when Oswald shouted ""I'm just a patsy!"" to the waiting press in the Dallas Police Department hallways. Of course, just exactly WHY this known liar (Oswald) -- who told one falsehood after another to both the police and the anxious press at the police station -- would suddenly be looked upon as a TRUTHFUL person by the conspiracy theorists, who believe he was telling the truth when he uttered his famous ""Patsy"" declaration after his arrest, is a mystery to me. Most curious indeed.""JFK"", which premiered in U.S. movie theaters on December 20th, 1991, might very well make some people think twice about what really happened in Dallas on November 22, 1963. But when weighed against all the evidence in the case, you soon begin to realize that the film is designed ONLY to make you think like Oliver Stone WANTS you to think.And I would also ask those conspiracy theorists who take this movie to heart to consider the rationale and logic that would have been exhibited by any ""plotters"" who were attempting to ""frame"" their lone ""Patsy"" PRIOR to the assassination. Because placing your faith in the boobs who supposedly cooked up the kind of PRE-assassination ""Let's-Frame-Oswald"" plot that is proposed by Mr. Stone in this film is akin to drawing to an 'Inside Straight'! I'd sooner believe the sun will rise in the west tomorrow.In other words -- In order to accept the idea that Lee Harvey Oswald was the ""Patsy"" he said he was, and in order to buy into Oliver Stone's 3-Gunmen, 6-Shot ""Triangulation of Crossfire"" conspiracy theory that is the central ""shooting plot"" as depicted in this motion picture, anyone who accepts this film's proposed shooting scenario as ""fact"" MUST, therefore, also be of the opinion that these ""conspirators""/""plotters"" had no hesitation whatsoever to green-light and proceed full-tilt with a ""Patsy"" plan that would involve the POTENTIAL final results of having the one and only target (John F. Kennedy) being hit with UP TO SIX SEPARATE BULLETS fired from the guns of THREE different snipers (one of which was firing from the front, the exact OPPOSITE direction from where the ONE ""Patsy"" was supposedly firing in the Texas School Book Depository Building, which was located to the REAR of the President's car).Even in a 'perfect conspiracy world', how in the heck could these covert ""plotters"" possibly have thought (on November 21st, the day before such a nutty plan would be taking place) that it was a GOOD idea to utilize three different assassins, who would ALL be drilling JFK's body (potentially) with many bullets in just a short 6-to-8-second time period -- with several of these missiles coming from OBVIOUS non-Oswald (non-""Patsy"") locations?Were these conspirators of the opinion (somehow) that JFK would be pronounced ""dead"" right there in the limousine, right there in Dealey Plaza, and would then be driven IMMEDIATELY to some ""Conspiracy Morgue"" someplace where all the wounds that have just been inflicted upon the President would be ""controlled"" by the same evil henchmen who conceived of this plot?Did the people who dreamed up this impossible-to-pull-off ""Frame-The-Lone-Patsy"" plot really NOT consider the possibility of ALL six shots striking President Kennedy (or all six shots hitting SOMEBODY in Dealey Plaza)?Did these plotters just automatically assume that all of the ""frontal-shot"" evidence (that would have invariably blown the Patsy Plot to bits just minutes after the gunfire had ceased in Dealey Plaza) wouldn't be noticed by ANY Parkland personnel -- and that ZERO of these many bullets that would be potentially entering the body of John F. Kennedy (or any other victims who might be accidentally hit) would ALL simply ""get lost"" on their own or wouldn't be seen by ANY non-plotters?Or was it the conspirators' belief that all of these bullets would immediately be collected by some additional conspirators within the hospital? Or -- did the plotters just feel it wouldn't make any difference how many bullets had pelted JFK's body, and that any 'Non-Oswald' bullet wounds would simply be ""taken care of"" by other ""after-the-shooting"" conspirators who were in charge of the ""Cover-Up"" operation? Kind of a reckless plan and a very large risk to take -- don't you think?Plus: Did these clandestine assassins really NOT consider the potential eyewitness accounts of the literally hundreds of witnesses who were scattered throughout Dealey Plaza to watch the President pass by? (Many of them with cameras, who would be photographing the dastardly deed, potentially acquiring the filmed proof of conspiracy within their still photos and motion pictures!)Did the plotters just GET LUCKY when not one single witness saw ANY assassin other than the killer located in the ""Oswald window"" in the Depository? And did they just get lucky that the vast majority of earwitnesses heard only three shots (the EXACT number that Oswald could have fired in the allotted assassination timeframe)?And: Did the conspirators also just ""luck out"" when very, very few witnesses (less than 5% total) said that they heard shots coming FROM MORE THAN ONE DIRECTION? (And the vast majority of these witnesses heard shots from BEHIND the President's car, from the direction of the School Book Depository.)Didn't ANY of these things go through the heads of these assassination-planning operatives? If these potential ""problems"" with their screwball plan didn't enter their brains, these guys weren't earning their covert dollars, that's for sure.Shouldn't just a small bit of common sense and practicality have crept into the minds of these people (whoever they were supposed to be)? And shouldn't at least one of these plotters have spoken up and said on 11-21-63: ""Gee, fellas, this plan seems a little bit loony to me. We're asking three different killers to all fire rifle bullets at JFK at virtually an identical point in time and yet also expect ALL of the trace evidence to, somehow, some way, immediately lead back to Oswald's window and only Oswald's rifle. Hmmm....maybe we ought to re-think the probability of this plan succeeding. Ya think?""But -- Per CTers, I guess nobody on the ""JFK Assassination Plot"" payroll made any such logical statement, and, therefore, the almost-certain-to-collapse plot was allowed to proceed, as planned.The ""Common Sense"" truth re. this mess that Oliver Stone purports in his movie is this --- From a PRE-assassination standpoint, a conspiracy plan as depicted in this film would have been just plain suicide for any team of conspirators, and is a plot that only a crazy person would think of going forward with. Which is the main reason why no such plan of this nature would have been implemented on 11-22-63; nor would such a foolish plot have even been considered in the first place, given the many obvious hazards and complications that such a ""Patsy"" operation would have presented.It's hilariously absurd from every given angle! Hard to believe any reasonable-thinking person can actually believe such ""Oswald Was Merely A Patsy"" nonsense.A portion of the ""hilarity"" in it stems from the idea that these behind-the-scenes plotters (who were supposedly manipulating Oswald like a puppet on a string) couldn't have cared less about the precise whereabouts of their one-and-only ""Patsy"" at the time JFK was being murdered.Because, per this movie, Lee Harvey is left free to roam the lower floors of the Depository building at his leisure (while supposedly waiting for a telephone call that never came), leaving him free to inadvertently establish himself a perfect alibi for his location and movements at exactly 12:30 PM on November 22 (should anyone happen to see him on the lower floors at 12:30).A great job by those ""Real Killers"" at keeping Oswald WHERE THEY NEEDED HIM, on the 6th Floor, huh? I guess it was just another instance (among gobs) where the ""real killers"" simply lucked out that afternoon, by not having one single person inside the Book Depository get even a brief glimpse of Lee Oswald on the lower TSBD floors at the time JFK is being killed outside the building. Will the grand luck of these conspirators ever run out? Per most CTers....apparently it never has.I think it's kind of interesting that Director Stone decided not to accept Robert Groden's complete version of the assassination. In his book (""The Killing Of A President""), Groden, who served as a technical adviser on the film ""JFK"", tells his readers of his conspiracy theory which involves a MINIMUM of 8 shots (and possibly even more). And, incredibly, Mr. Groden claims that NONE of these eight bullets likely came from the Oswald window in the TSBD! ~LOL break~ .... Please note that even Mr. Stone didn't ""buy"" that silliness.But, as far as Oliver Stone's ""JFK"" filmmaking is concerned, I think it's quite good. Very authentic-looking 1963-era ""re-creations"" were filmed of Dealey Plaza and the motorcade (with an appropriate amount of old-time ""graininess"" added to the new imagery), which have been intercut throughout the movie with actual news clips and amateur film footage. At times, it is difficult to discern between the re-creations and actual archival footage (although JFK assassination experts will have no trouble spying the differences). The editing of this picture is on a level way above anything else you're likely to see anywhere. And the John Williams music score is also superb.I have the 2-Disc Widescreen DVD edition of ""JFK: Special Edition Director's Cut"" (in the ""Snapper"" type case) that was released by Warner Home Video on February 6, 2001, which does not include the 90-minute ""Beyond JFK: The Question Of Conspiracy"" documentary that is available on the newer (2003) 2-Disc SE.This 2001 edition, though, does sport a beautiful Anamorphic (16x9-enhanced) DVD transfer (in the wide ""scope"" aspect ratio of 2.35:1). That fabulous music of John Williams shines brightly, too, via the disc's rich-sounding Dolby Digital 5.1 audio track. This DVD might own the record for most ""Chapter Breaks"", too (88 of 'em)!The bonus features on this (2001) 2-Disc DVD set aren't really that much to write home about, IMO. There's an Audio Commentary Track by Oliver Stone and some ""Deleted/Extended Scenes"" (which I did enjoy seeing). But the totality of the extras on this older DVD edition seem to be a tad on the weak side -- especially the feature on Disc 2 called ""Multimedia Essays"", which is pretty much dry as dust, IMHO. (Of course, I say this as a staunch ""LNer"" who believes in Lee Oswald's lone guilt in the JFK and J.D. Tippit murders; so {possibly} that's part of the reason I fail to see a whole bunch of redeeming qualities in these conspiracy-slanted ""Essays"" that are presented here.)----------------Some Closing ""JFK"" Thoughts & Recommendations.........I enjoy watching Mr. Stone's ""JFK"" -- but from the standpoint of ""fictional drama"" only; and certainly not from any kind of ""historically accurate"" POV at all. The ""CT-created drama"", along with the music score and the outstanding editing together of re-constructed scenes with real 11-22-63 film footage are all things that are noteworthy in the movie.But I'll stick with my own (and Vincent Bugliosi's) version of assassination events (i.e., Oswald was guilty as sin and had no helpers), rather than take a huge leap off the conspiracy diving board, where every theory being discussed is as cloudy and murky as the ""Badge Man"" image in Mary Moorman's famous Polaroid photograph.The next time you watch this movie, take notes and count the number of times where the evidence is presented in anything close to an ""unbiased"" manner. At the end of the 3-hour motion picture, you'll still be left with a blank piece of notepaper.At the very least, the movie should have a disclaimer crawling along at the bottom of the screen every ten minutes while watching it. Something akin to .... ""What you are watching is a fictional account of a true-life event. Handle with care; and with lots of salt.""I'd advise anyone interested in the JFK assassination to seek out (at any cost) the amazingly-good 1964 documentary ""Four Days In November"" (MGM/UA Home Video). It's a 123-minute journey back to November 1963 that is supported by the FACTS and EVIDENCE in the JFK case. It gives a detailed and thorough chronology of all four days surrounding President Kennedy's assassination, including Ruby killing Oswald and also a look at the hard facts supporting Lee Oswald's blatantly-obvious guilt in the murder of police officer J.D. Tippit.""Four Days In November"" is the antithesis of Oliver Stone's fantasy film. I'd strongly recommend to everyone that they watch ""Four Days"" immediately after watching Stone's film. It's a night-and-day difference, of course. But at least ""Four Days"" is based on a little something that Mr. Stone's ""JFK"" doesn't get within a country mile of -- i.e.: The documented and verified facts of the events of November 22, 1963.So, I'd say -- Watch Oliver Stone's slickly-presented piece of motion-picture entertainment by all means. But don't forget the salt shaker. Because it shall be needed.",2,"Great Movie-Making ....

Jack Ruby didn't place the bullet on the Texas Governor's strecher.  In the movie, he wasn't wearing gloves (check me if I'm wrong).  There would be fingerprints.  No fingerprints were found on the bullet.3.  If there was a &quot;Magic Bullet&quot; it didn't go right, left right, left, etc.  The Texas governor was sitting 3 inches below Kennedy, closer to the door than Kennedy, he was a little wider than Kennedy.  There are a few other differences.  This evens out the bullet.  The bullet has a straight path through both bodies.4.  The last speech by Jim Garrison (the long one right before the jury voted) he never said.5.  There were not 6-8 shots fired.  A police officer accidentally left his recorder running on his motercycle.  It recorded exactly 3 shots, not 6-8 shots.There are a few more flaws in the movie.

93221,A35RLO0D7DWL50,0790729733,"""demonofthefall55""","[2, 3]","This film is capable of far more than simply entertaining it's viewers for a few hours. For me, this film evoked one of the strongest emotional reactions I've ever had to a movie. This film will leave you in a cognitive, and perhaps even betrayed, state of mind.First, I would like to point out that I am fully aware that this film is not entirely factual. I understand that some liberties were taken with the way that the historical events actually unfolded, but that doesn't mean that it's completely false. While this movie is a work of fiction, there is a great deal of true information that accompanies the aforementioned fiction. From what I understand, Stone did not intend this film to be taken as entirely factual, but instead for the viewer to get the overall message that it's important not to believe everything the government tells you just because it's what the government tells you. As the character Jim Garrison says in the movie (I'm paraphrasing here), all it takes is a few corrupt individuals with power to perpetuate a massive lie. I think that this is something that all would do well to remember for the next time the government, or any one else for that matter, proposes a questionable story, such as the non sense one shooter/magic bullet theory.Now that the history vs. fiction aspect is out of the way, onto the movie itself. I can honestly say that this is one of the most solid movies I've ever seen. From direction, to acting, to writing, to editing, this movie is absolutely remarkable. I personally believe it to be Oliver Stone's finest cinematic offering to date, with Natural Born Killers coming in at an extremely close second.The film features an ensemble cast who all turn in fantastic performances, especially Gary Oldman and Kevin Costner. Costner's portrayal of Jim Garrison is entertaining and wholly believable. Gary Oldman also gives a fantastic performance as Lee Harvey Oswald, he truly manages to capture the character. The rest of the cast is also very good. Micheal Rooker, John Candy, Sissy Spacek, Joe Pesci, and Donald Sutherland all provide great supporting performances. Donald Sutherland is terrific as Garrison's CIA insider source. His speech he gives while walking in the park is one of the finest points in the movies. I also liked John Candy's performance as Jim's friend from law school who had been asked to be Oswald's attorney. He was one character I don't think we saw enough of.Stone's direction here is also incredible. He does a marvelous job at depicting society's reaction to the assassination of JFK. Many are saddened by the loss while others are thrilled by the idea of removing a ""Castro sympathizer"" from the highest office in the country. Stone is also very adept at 'taking the viewer along for the ride', for lack of a better phrase. The deeper into the conspiracy Garrison goes, the deeper you go and I at least felt as though I were there every step of the way, until the final courtroom seen where the viewer is put more in the position of the jury than in the position Garrison.The editing in this film is remarkable as well. Splicing of black and white footage into the film as well as the use of 35 mm footage is genious. I can't imagine the amount of time and work that must've gone into the editing process of this movie. I think that's it's probably the best I've ever seen.The writing is also phenomenal. The script is very well researched and the dialog is very absorbing. The conversations are informational, but not to the point that they become boring. I think the writers managed to strike a nice balance in that respect.But even with all that aside, even without the great editing, directing, and writing, the film still works on a personal level. The JFK era may be well before my time, but I can still identify with Garrison's quest for justice and truth. I think that Garrison's desire for honesty is the real universal message hear, and I think that it's something all viewers will be able to identify with. The need for truth is something that humanity will always have, and I think that through that need this film will live on for a very long time.",5,Essential Oliver Stone,1056326400,"06 23, 2003",2003,4149,"['film', 'capable', 'far', 'more', 'simply', 'entertaining', 'viewers', 'few', 'hours', 'film', 'evoked', 'one', 'strongest', 'emotional', 'reactions', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'had', 'movie', 'film', 'will', 'leave', 'cognitive', 'perhaps', 'even', 'betrayed', 'state', 'mind.First', 'would', 'like', 'point', 'out', 'am', 'fully', 'aware', 'film', 'not', 'entirely', 'factual', 'understand', 'liberties', 'were', 'taken', 'way', 'historical', 'events', 'actually', 'unfolded', ""n't"", 'mean', 'completely', 'false', 'movie', 'work', 'fiction', 'great', 'deal', 'true', 'information', 'aforementioned', 'fiction', 'what', 'understand', 'Stone', 'did', 'not', 'intend', 'film', 'be', 'taken', 'entirely', 'factual', 'instead', 'viewer', 'get', 'overall', 'message', 'important', 'not', 'believe', 'everything', 'government', 'just', 'what', 'government', 'character', 'Jim', 'Garrison', 'movie', ""'m"", 'paraphrasing', 'here', 'few', 'corrupt', 'individuals', 'power', 'perpetuate', 'massive', 'lie', 'think', 'something', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'remember', 'next', 'time', 'government', 'one', 'else', 'matter', 'questionable', 'story', 'such', 'non', 'sense', 'one', 'shooter/magic', 'bullet', 'theory.Now', 'history', 'vs.', 'fiction', 'aspect', 'way', 'movie', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'one', 'most', 'solid', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'direction', 'acting', 'writing', 'editing', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'remarkable', 'personally', 'believe', 'be', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'finest', 'cinematic', 'offering', 'date', 'Natural', 'Born', 'Killers', 'coming', 'extremely', 'close', 'second.The', 'film', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'who', 'turn', 'fantastic', 'performances', 'especially', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'Costner', 'portrayal', 'Jim', 'Garrison', 'entertaining', 'wholly', 'believable', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'also', 'fantastic', 'performance', 'Lee', 'Harvey', 'Oswald', 'truly', 'capture', 'character', 'rest', 'cast', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'Micheal', 'Rooker', 'John', 'Candy', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'Joe', 'Pesci', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'provide', 'great', 'supporting', 'performances', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'terrific', 'Garrison', 'CIA', 'insider', 'source', 'speech', 'walking', 'park', 'one', 'finest', 'points', 'movies', 'also', 'liked', 'John', 'Candy', 'performance', 'Jim', 'friend', 'law', 'school', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'asked', 'be', 'Oswald', 'attorney', 'was', 'one', 'character', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'saw', 'enough', 'of.Stone', 'direction', 'here', 'also', 'incredible', 'marvelous', 'job', 'depicting', 'society', 'reaction', 'assassination', 'JFK', 'Many', 'are', 'saddened', 'loss', 'others', 'are', 'thrilled', 'idea', 'removing', 'Castro', 'sympathizer', 'highest', 'office', 'country', 'Stone', 'also', 'very', 'adept', ""'taking"", 'viewer', 'ride', 'lack', 'better', 'phrase', 'deeper', 'conspiracy', 'Garrison', 'deeper', 'go', 'least', 'felt', 'were', 'there', 'step', 'way', 'final', 'courtroom', 'seen', 'where', 'viewer', 'put', 'more', 'position', 'jury', 'position', 'Garrison.The', 'editing', 'film', 'remarkable', 'as', 'well', 'Splicing', 'black', 'white', 'footage', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'use', '35', 'mm', 'footage', 'genious', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'amount', 'time', 'work', 'must', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'editing', 'process', 'movie', 'think', 'probably', 'best', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen.The', 'writing', 'also', 'phenomenal', 'script', 'very', 'well', 'researched', 'dialog', 'very', 'absorbing', 'conversations', 'are', 'informational', 'not', 'point', 'become', 'boring', 'think', 'writers', 'managed', 'strike', 'nice', 'balance', 'respect.But', 'even', 'aside', 'even', 'great', 'editing', 'directing', 'writing', 'film', 'still', 'personal', 'level', 'JFK', 'era', 'may', 'be', 'well', 'time', 'can', 'still', 'identify', 'Garrison', 'quest', 'justice', 'truth', 'think', 'Garrison', 'desire', 'honesty', 'real', 'universal', 'message', 'hear', 'think', 'something', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'identify', 'need', 'truth', 'something', 'humanity', 'will', 'always', 'have', 'think', 'need', 'film', 'will', 'live', 'very', 'long', 'time']",JFK Director's Cut

It has contributed to the nonsense that there was a conspiracy - it is convincing when it presents the 'facts' but this film is full of errors. Also, as an artistic film, the strength of the story / emotional drama etc... is carried by the gravity of the evidence / material but one you realize this is all a fake and a Hollywood bastardization of the truth it falls apart factually and artistically.This film has more holes than a wicker canoe. True, some of the evidence was 'gospel' when the film was made but many errors and half truths made it into the film as absolute fact. Some examples:-Oswald was a lousy shot: in truth he was an expert shot and a sharpshooter - they even have his shooting tests from the military-3 shots in 6 seconds - it wasn't. It was 8.3 seconds, and it's easy (time-wise)-the head back and to the left - the wound evidence that Cyril Wecht has made a career out of criticizing is conclusive that he was shot from the rear. Conservation of momentum shows that if a huge heavy chunk of head moves away at high speed that the body will move in the opposite direction - in fact ANY direction is possible depending on the entry and where the fragments blow out-the magic spinning bullet - anyone with 2 eyes who has really looked at the Zapruder film can see that when that shot was fired that Connelly was sitting lower than JFK, towards the middle of the car, and sharply turned - not sitting square and facing forward as shown in the film - when you connect the lines it make a perfect straight line-the pristine bullet - it was not pristine, the groove pattern matched the rifle, PROVING it was fired by the rifle found in the book depository and there are missing fragments that were found in Connolly.-I don't remember if it was in the film, but the microphone evidence has all been disprovedAlso, Garrison's testimony in the real case relied ona  witness who admitted he never saw Clay Shaw, Ferry and Oswald together - when asked under a polygraph yes or no, he said 'well if you ask me yes or no, it would have to be a no'Garrison suborned perjury in this case - that seems clearer and clearer over time. We don't want to accept that this dysfunctional insignificant human being who even the soviets got bored of (and realized he was useless as a piece of propaganda and sent him back) could possibly have cut down such a great historical figure. We don't WANT to believe that, but it is true. Garrison makes him out to be a hero double agent! For God's sake, this guy was a personality disorder whose only double agent work was trying to act tough and be a commie wanna-be who would annoy anti-Castro Cubans then later appear on TV to advocate Marxism. He was an attention hound ! The 60s weren;t today - not everybody got on TV looking for 15 minutes of fame like today - you had to try hard... He would constantly mix himself up with these people to stir the pot like all dysfunctional personality disorders who live off the reaction they create in others. That's why everyone think he's tied up in some conspiracy - because of the company he kept, his changing positions etc...but in reality he was playing people for reactions. It's pathetic, really.So save your money and watch any of the excellent documentaries that tear this apart entirely. And don't (like me) waste any money on 'The Men WHo Killed Kennedy' documentary from the UK either - more pseudo-science with a deep british narrator's voice which is also full of errors and omissions and even wilder theories than in 'JFK'People like pathologist Wecht have done a huge disservice further stirring this pot. Sure the gov't has screwed up aspects of the investigation and autopsy etc.. Show me anything they get right!It's time to stop this nonsense once and for all - don't waste your money on the upteenth reissue of this dog of a film and make Stone ever richer than he already is. Look for a book or documentary that tells you the real story.So, yawn, this is all phony Hollywood melodrama. Shame on you Oliver Stone - I used to believe this because the film was convincing, but now that we know it's all fake you should issue an apology to the nation.

However, I recommend this two-disc DVD for the additional documentary material it brings to the table.  - Doug Peschka]Since before ""JFK"" was first released in 1991, the national media have been jumpingall over Oliver Stone's case for not making a historically accurate documentary.HELLO!  Oliver Stone said himself that never was his intention to begin with !!!Folks, this movie is not about the actual facts of who really killed John Kennedy and why.It's all about the value of every conscientious American thinking for themselves and questioning authority.And that's what ""JFK"" does - it makes you think for yourself and ask your own questions,and do your own thinking.  On that merit alone, it would make John Kennedy - and Robert Kennedy - both very proud.That is what our schools' history books should do.  Not just feed us the official line that ""A lone nut named Oswald did it alone"".  But a present us with all of the known facts, and an encouragement to all students - and to all the American People - to search for the truth themselves.In a book called Proverbs, we are reminded that ""Where there is no vision, the people perish.""Nothing is more important than facing the world with our eyes and minds open.That is the central meaning of ""JFK"".  When I sat in the theater in early 1992 and watched""JFK"" I thought of the important words of Jackson Browne's 1987 hit ""Lives In The Balance"":""You might ask what it takes to rememberwhen you know that you've seen it before,where a government lies to a peopleand a country is drifting to war.They sell us the President the same waythey sell us our clothes and our cars.They sell us everything from Youth to Religionthe same time they sell us our wars.I want to know who the men in the shadows areI want to hear somebody asking them whythey can be counted on to tell us who our enemies arebut they're never the ones to fight or to die.""No, not all of ""JFK"" is fact.

93230,A1E6JS6C205VZD,0790729733,Dr. Laurence Raw,"[0, 0]","JFK is one of those films whose impact never diminishes, even after two decades since its initial release. In the wake of the fiftieth anniversary of the assassination, Oliver Stone's claim that the whole event was deliberately engineered by an unholy alliance of the government, the CIA, FBI and other institutions, cannot be readily dismissed. In terms of filmmaking, JFK is cleverly structured as a quest-narrative, with Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) gradually discovering more and more details about the assassination, and the various cover-ups that followed, while being continually frustrated in his task by obstructive institutions and/or individuals. It is a testament to his tenacity that he does not give up. In the final sequence he offers a tour de force in court as he presents his evidence at the trial of Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones), whom he suspects of being a CIA agent. We already know the outcome of the trial, but Garrison's case is convincing nonetheless. Director Oliver Stone skillfully blends archive footage, black-and-white re-enactments of important events and color film to create a narrative which, although over two and a half hours in length, never fails to hold our attention. He is helped out by a clutch of excellent performances, notably from Costner (easily his finest hour in the cinema), Jones, Joe Pesci, Sissy Spacek and - in cameo roles - Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau. Definitely a film to look at again and again.",4,Highly Influential Retelling of the Kennedy Assassination that Still Packs a Punch Two Decades After its Initial Release,1387065600,"12 15, 2013",2013,1456,"['JFK', 'one', 'films', 'impact', 'never', 'even', 'two', 'decades', 'initial', 'release', 'wake', 'fiftieth', 'anniversary', 'assassination', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'claim', 'whole', 'event', 'was', 'deliberately', 'engineered', 'unholy', 'alliance', 'government', 'CIA', 'FBI', 'other', 'institutions', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'readily', 'dismissed', 'terms', 'filmmaking', 'JFK', 'cleverly', 'structured', 'quest-narrative', 'Jim', 'Garrison', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'gradually', 'discovering', 'more', 'more', 'details', 'assassination', 'various', 'cover-ups', 'followed', 'being', 'continually', 'frustrated', 'task', 'obstructive', 'institutions', 'and/or', 'individuals', 'testament', 'tenacity', 'not', 'give', 'up', 'final', 'sequence', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'court', 'evidence', 'trial', 'Clay', 'Shaw', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'whom', 'being', 'CIA', 'agent', 'already', 'know', 'outcome', 'trial', 'Garrison', 'case', 'convincing', 'nonetheless', 'Director', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'skillfully', 'archive', 'footage', 'black-and-white', 're-enactments', 'important', 'events', 'color', 'film', 'create', 'narrative', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'length', 'never', 'hold', 'attention', 'helped', 'out', 'clutch', 'excellent', 'performances', 'notably', 'Costner', 'easily', 'finest', 'hour', 'cinema', 'Jones', 'Joe', 'Pesci', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'cameo', 'roles', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'Walter', 'Matthau', 'Definitely', 'film', 'look', 'again', 'again']",JFK Director's Cut

93232,A2TWIZ33KJCQ54,0790729733,"Dr. Luther Wolfgang Polaris ""LWP""","[1, 2]","MY IMPRESSION - - INCREDIBLY WELL DONE DRAMATIZATION: BUT WHERE EXACTLY IS THE TRUTH?To evaluate this film fairly is like evaluating the book ""State of Fear"". If one agrees with the Author/Director's conclusions, the film or book is great. If not, it is garbage or worse, in one's opinion. I have chosen to treat both of these as prime examples of fictionalization. In that light, this film is terrific entertainment and does indeed get people thinking and politicians worrying.A FICTIONALIZED INTERPRETATION OF THE FACTS - -Of course, it is a shame that everything in the book is not pure fact. Watching this film, one becomes certain that Clay Shaw, played by Tommy Lee Jones in an Oscar-winning role, was certainly guilty as sin. After all, we all but saw him commit the crime. Jim Garrison played deftly by Kevin Costner proves every point including Clay Shaw's perjury as we see the answers to the questions Garrison is asking in flashback form which is followed by Shaw telling yet another lie. The same style is used with John Candy's character Dean Andrews answering the question, ""Did you ever met Clay Shaw?"", with, ""I never met the dude"", while he asks for more cashews from Shaw in a simultaneous flashback. Oliver Stone uses this flashback device as a sort of lie detector for the viewers' benefit and entertainment throughout the film to reinforce his point. The benefit is the immediate comprehension of the point that Stone wants to make, but the entertainment value is the more lasting one. In essence, watching these scenes over and over is just as comedic each time but as one gets familiar with the facts [as they are being presented], one can both see the flaws in the argument and be drawn to collecting the facts oneself from more objective sources. If only Stone had been a little more objective with his arguments/facts, this film would have been a great gift to humankind instead of just great entertainment for film fans/JFK conspiracy theorists.ABOUT THE 2 DISK DVD SPECIAL EDITION:There are scenes in this DVD that are not on the VHS or theatrical releases. These additions make much of the rapid-fire quasi-facts presented during the Garrison explanations at trial make more sense. Widescreen helps too, as this ensemble cast does not quite fit in full frame in some sequences.FEATURES: THIS DIRECTOR'S CUT 2-DISK SET IS WORTH THE DIFFERENCE!Deleted scenes are usually best left deleted. This film is no exception as they really slow things down, but they do add understanding to the heart of the film's premise. There is also a thought-provoking feature which details what the Congress has done regarding looking into this matter (JFK's assassination) after this film's release.-- * ABRIDGED LIST OF THE CAST -- *Kevin Costner - Jim GarrisonSissy Spacek - Liz GarrisonJoe Pesci - David FerrieTommy Lee Jones - Clay ShawGary Oldman - Lee Harvey OswaldMichael Rooker - Bill BroussardJay O.

Why, then, does a film that presents an opinion get dragged through the mud?Before seeing the film I'd read many books regarding the assassination. Going in, I had my own opinion that Oswald could not have killed Kennedy. There was definitely the possibility that he'd been involved, but he couldn't have done the shooting.This film presents the idea that the CIA had been invloved - something I agree with - but primarily it follows the case of Clay Shaw. Personally, I don't believe he had been involved. And if he was, it was unknowingly. Like Oswald, I think he was used. Like many people it would seem.The films most positive trait is its willingness to leave room for you to come to your own conclusions. It presents many well known, and some not so well known, facts. As an assistant to Jim Garrison [our main character] says, when referring to Oswald supposedly doing the shooting from the Book Depository, &quot;that's the whole essence of the case to me. The guy couldn't do the shooting&quot;. Coupled with all the reports of witnesses to a man behind the fence on the knoll, and the clear evidence that more than three shots were fired, we know that many of the reports are a fabrication.The most important question it asks is not who killed Kennedy, but why he was killed. The idea of it having to do with Vietnam is a little far fetched, but worth considering. Garrison's meeting with Mr. X is especially revealing, when you discover how much basic Secret Service protocall was ignored that day.The special features are excellent. Oliver Stone's commentary is insightful, and the 50 minutes of cut scenes worth watching twice [with and without commentary].

Melillo ""gloriana""","[3, 3]","The brilliance in this film's production is that, by the artful interweaving of historical footage with the dramatic scenes, the finished product seems like an insightful, revisionist documentary. This is the film's strength and weakness, because it is primarily historical fiction in that Jim Garrison's point of view is presented as incontrovertible fact. I would caution those viewing the film, who may have no familiarity with the Kennedy assasination, that its plot not only presents Jim Garrison (of whom I'd never heard before seeing ""JFK"") in quite a different light than any Google search would reveal, but even distorts actual individuals with whom the real Garrison had dealings.If one can detach oneself from the slanted version of the facts, it is a totally rivetting film. Kevin Costner heads a sterling cast - the acting is superb, and so believable that, despite the many familiar faces of fine actors whom one has seen in many roles, one nearly has the impression of having an inside look at 'real people' revealing secret dimensions to the evidence. For example, Ed Asner shows a shocking side to the attitudes towards the assasination which some in Dallas may have held (seeing the murderer as hero, where I'd always thought of Kennedy as an esteemed, well loved president), with a rough but convincing demeanour which is both deep and chilling. Joe Pesci gives a multi dimensional picture, both moving and puzzling, of the bizarre David Ferry.I've rarely seen a lengthy film (and one in which I recognised significant innacuracy in relation to history) which so totally held my interest.",5,"Engrossing drama, superb performances - and brilliant cinematography",1204416000,"03 2, 2008",2008,1607,"['brilliance', 'film', 'production', 'artful', 'interweaving', 'historical', 'footage', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'finished', 'product', 'insightful', 'revisionist', 'documentary', 'film', 'strength', 'weakness', 'primarily', 'historical', 'fiction', 'Jim', 'Garrison', 'point', 'view', 'presented', 'incontrovertible', 'fact', 'would', 'caution', 'viewing', 'film', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'familiarity', 'Kennedy', 'assasination', 'plot', 'not', 'only', 'Jim', 'Garrison', 'whom', ""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'seeing', 'JFK', 'quite', 'different', 'light', 'Google', 'search', 'would', 'reveal', 'even', 'distorts', 'actual', 'individuals', 'whom', 'real', 'Garrison', 'had', 'dealings.If', 'one', 'can', 'detach', 'slanted', 'version', 'facts', 'totally', 'rivetting', 'film', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'sterling', 'cast', 'acting', 'superb', 'so', 'believable', 'many', 'familiar', 'fine', 'actors', 'whom', 'one', 'seen', 'many', 'roles', 'one', 'nearly', 'impression', 'having', 'inside', 'look', ""'real"", 'people', 'revealing', 'secret', 'dimensions', 'evidence', 'example', 'Ed', 'Asner', 'shocking', 'side', 'attitudes', 'assasination', 'Dallas', 'may', 'have', 'held', 'seeing', 'murderer', 'hero', 'where', ""'d"", 'always', 'thought', 'Kennedy', 'esteemed', 'well', 'loved', 'president', 'rough', 'convincing', 'demeanour', 'deep', 'chilling', 'Joe', 'Pesci', 'multi', 'dimensional', 'picture', 'moving', 'puzzling', 'bizarre', 'David', 'Ferry.I', ""'ve"", 'rarely', 'seen', 'lengthy', 'film', 'one', 'recognised', 'significant', 'innacuracy', 'relation', 'history', 'so', 'totally', 'held', 'interest']",JFK Director's Cut

93242,A1OJB1AQVIKFG1,0790729733,Eric Krupin,"[2, 4]","Oliver Stone described this movie as a ""counter-myth"" to the Warren Commission Report. That was an artful way of admitting that his film is a work of fiction.For example, he portrays Garrison's version of the point in the Clay Shaw trial where New Orleans Police officer Aloysius Habighorst is to be called as a witness who will testify that Shaw, while being booked, admitted to using the alias Clay Bertrand: ""But before Habighorst could take the stand, Judge Haggerty suddenly ordered the jury removed from the court."" Like everything else in the movie, the dramatic effectiveness is terrific.However, it's simply not true. It was Garrison's own second chair, Assistant DA James Alcock, who asked for the jury to be removed: ""Your Honor, before calling the State's next witness, I might announce to the Court that the matter we are now going into, by law is required to be gone into outside the presence of the Jury, so at this time I would ask the Court to excuse the Jury so that we might enter this area in accordance with the law."" There's no controversy about this. The trial transcript is public record and available online.Dramatic license, you might say. Like the composite characters. Or the fact that Garrison did not meet Fletcher Prouty - the ""X"" so brilliantly portrayed by Donald Sutherland - until long after the Shaw trial.But the film's insinuations come in such a rapid-fire onslaught that they overwhelm one's critical faculties. X says, ""We had a third of a combat division returning from Germany in the air above the United States at the time of the shooting, and at 12:34 PM, the entire telephone system went dead in Washington for a solid hour, and on the plane back to Washington, word was radioed from the White House Situation Room to Lyndon Johnson that one individual performed the assassination.""In fact, the phone outages were uneven and occurred in several major cities - as one would expect in the wake of such a cataclysmic news story. [Search for ""sinister phone outage"" for details.] I'm sure many of you tried and failed to telephone people in New York City on 9/11. And I don't believe even 9/11 truthers attribute that to a government conspiracy. However, the ""JFK"" viewer has no time to process any of this.Now I am not condemning the movie for this. On the contrary, it's what makes it such a riveting viewing experience. [The few dull scenes - most of which are the boilerplate domestic stuff with Sissy Spacek - come almost as a relief from the surrounding three hours of tension and paranoia.] But the result is as propagandistic as anything put forward by Warren Commission defenders like Gerald Posner or Vincent Bugliosi.I don't believe Kennedy was the peacenik Stone hero-worships him as. So I don't believe his central theory that Kennedy was killed as a threat to the military-industrial establishment. I also don't believe that a commission comprised of the ilk of Gerald Ford and Arlen Specter deserves the least benefit of the doubt. So the questions remain - and probably always will.

93243,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,0790729733,Erik North,"[1, 1]","Even now, ten years after it was first unleashed, Oliver Stone's 1991 epic JFK continues to provoke controversy and debate, like many great films have been known to do.  Perhaps he can be faulted to a point by raising so many conspiracy theories and for making a hero out of New Orleans D.A. Jim Garrison, who was the only one to prosecute a JFK-related case.  What Stone can't be faulted for, however, is taking on this whole thing in the first place, and with good reason.The assassination of President John Fitzgerald Kennedy in Dallas on November 22, 1963 remains one of the darkest events in our nation's history.  This is made even more so because the official version of the murder propogated by the Warren Commission and apologists like Gerald Psoner stopped being believable to a lot of Americans a long time ago, well before Stone's film was ever conceived.  Stone offers what he calls a ""counter-myth"" to the Warren report, one that involves a cabal of individuals from the Mafia, the CIA, organized crime, and the military/industrial complex coordinating to do in a man who might very well have ended the Cold War during his term in office and might very well have stopped the disaster that befell our nation in Vietnam.His theories on the ""Who"" are open to question, but the ""Why"" is far more believable and far more troubling.  As played by Kevin Costner (perhaps his greatest performance), Garrison dwells into a New Orleans connection to the Dallas tragedy and indicts local businessman Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones) on conspiracy charges.  Lack of tangible evidence caused a jury to acquit Shaw of the charges, but this didn't mean that Garrison was wrong for bringing the case to trial.  And if U.S. history since November 22, 1963 has shown us anything, it is that he certainly wasn't wrong for suggesting that JFK's murder was not only a turning point, but an elaborate coup d'etat.Stone crams in a great deal of material that has to be absorbed during its 205-minute running time, but he is aided by a cast that is to die for: Sissy Spacek, Joe Pesci, Ed Asner, Jack Lemmon, Kevin Bacon, Walter Matthau, Laurie Metcalfe, Donald Sutherland, Michael Rooker, Gary Oldman (as ""alleged"" assassin Lee Harvey Oswald), and many others.  With the Oscar-winning help of editors Joe Hutsching and Pietro Scala and cinematographer Ralph Richardson, Stone also masters the ""montage"" complex, editing together in great rapidity footage shot in 16-millimeter, 35-millimeter, color, and black and white.  Nobody had used the montage method with this kind of power since Sam Peckinpah did it in his 1969 classic THE WILD BUNCH.  John Williams contributes another one of his masterful music scores.Even if it seems to be too ambitious and zealous for its own good at times, JFK is essential viewing for people who want to come to grips with everything that has happened to America since that dark day in Dallas.  It is gripping from end to end, a true American epic.",5,"What really happened on November 22, 1963?",994636800,"07 9, 2001",2001,2967,"['Even', 'now', 'ten', 'years', 'was', 'first', 'unleashed', 'Oliver', 'Stone', '1991', 'epic', 'JFK', 'provoke', 'controversy', 'debate', 'many', 'great', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'known', 'do', 'Perhaps', 'can', 'be', 'faulted', 'point', 'raising', 'so', 'many', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'making', 'hero', 'New', 'Orleans', 'D.A', 'Jim', 'Garrison', 'who', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'prosecute', 'JFK-related', 'case', 'What', 'Stone', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'faulted', 'however', 'taking', 'whole', 'thing', 'first', 'place', 'good', 'reason.The', 'assassination', 'President', 'John', 'Fitzgerald', 'Kennedy', 'Dallas', 'November', '22', '1963', 'one', 'darkest', 'events', 'nation', 'history', 'made', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'official', 'version', 'murder', 'propogated', 'Warren', 'Commission', 'apologists', 'Gerald', 'Psoner', 'stopped', 'being', 'believable', 'lot', 'Americans', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'well', 'Stone', 'film', 'was', 'ever', 'conceived', 'Stone', 'what', 'counter-myth', 'Warren', 'report', 'one', 'cabal', 'individuals', 'Mafia', 'CIA', 'organized', 'crime', 'military/industrial', 'complex', 'coordinating', 'do', 'man', 'who', 'might', 'very', 'well', 'have', 'ended', 'Cold', 'War', 'term', 'office', 'might', 'very', 'well', 'have', 'stopped', 'disaster', 'nation', 'Vietnam.His', 'theories', 'Who', 'are', 'open', 'question', 'Why', 'far', 'more', 'believable', 'far', 'more', 'troubling', 'played', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'perhaps', 'greatest', 'performance', 'Garrison', 'New', 'Orleans', 'connection', 'Dallas', 'tragedy', 'local', 'businessman', 'Clay', 'Shaw', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'conspiracy', 'charges', 'Lack', 'tangible', 'evidence', 'caused', 'jury', 'acquit', 'Shaw', 'charges', 'did', ""n't"", 'mean', 'Garrison', 'was', 'wrong', 'bringing', 'case', 'trial', 'U.S.', 'history', 'November', '22', '1963', 'shown', 'anything', 'certainly', 'was', ""n't"", 'wrong', 'suggesting', 'JFK', 'murder', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'turning', 'point', 'elaborate', 'coup', ""d'etat.Stone"", 'crams', 'great', 'deal', 'material', 'be', 'absorbed', '205-minute', 'running', 'time', 'aided', 'cast', 'die', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'Joe', 'Pesci', 'Ed', 'Asner', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'Walter', 'Matthau', 'Laurie', 'Metcalfe', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'Michael', 'Rooker', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'alleged', 'assassin', 'Lee', 'Harvey', 'Oswald', 'many', 'others', 'Oscar-winning', 'help', 'editors', 'Joe', 'Hutsching', 'Pietro', 'Scala', 'cinematographer', 'Ralph', 'Richardson', 'Stone', 'also', 'montage', 'complex', 'editing', 'together', 'great', 'rapidity', 'footage', 'shot', '16-millimeter', '35-millimeter', 'color', 'black', 'white', 'Nobody', 'had', 'used', 'montage', 'method', 'kind', 'power', 'Sam', 'Peckinpah', 'did', '1969', 'classic', 'THE', 'WILD', 'BUNCH', 'John', 'Williams', 'one', 'masterful', 'music', 'scores.Even', 'be', 'too', 'ambitious', 'zealous', 'own', 'good', 'times', 'JFK', 'essential', 'viewing', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'come', 'grips', 'everything', 'happened', 'America', 'dark', 'day', 'Dallas', 'gripping', 'end', 'end', 'true', 'American', 'epic']",JFK Director's Cut

Stone seemingly makes a big deal of this film, and the film captures a grandiose nature intended for such a big moment in American history. Like it or hate it, and there are many reviewers on both sides of this fence, this film is engrossing, fascinating, and captivating in terms of its production. The director doesn't seemingly leave any rock unturned without some type of explanation into what happened before, during and after the assassination of JFK. While many may disagree with the theories depicted in the film, the larger question that the film seemingly asks about not only JFK, but America is ""What if?"" What if things that were presented after the assassination weren't as crystal clear as we had thought they were? JFK certainly brings to the forefront an important day in American history, and questions the nature of what is real and what is illusion, and, for these reasons, I feel as though this is a film that everyone should see.Kevin Costner's portrayal of Jim Garrison is outstanding, and he illustrates the very essence of a man who questions why Kennedy died that day in Dallas. While his investigation is momentous in its own right, it also is not a popular one in the public eye. After the assassination, he takes apart piece by piece not only those who might have been present or implicated in some way to that event, but reconstructs the entire time frame beforehand leading up to the assassination. He only manages to make some head way when he begins to ""ruffle some feathers"", such as an investigation into the CIA, FBI and even those in Congress. He also is able to reconstruct a time table for the whereabouts of Lee Harvey Oswald (Gary Oldman). Garrison works tirelessly and laboriously to the point where it not only affects the support of those around him, but also his family life. As the man obsessed with discovering the truth, Garrison puts it best when talking with reporters, ""Let justice be done, though the heavens fall.""Garrison is able to get to question some key figures in this case, such as Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones), David Ferry (Kevin Bacon), and a man who goes by the name ""X"" (Donald Sutherland). Garrison asserts that things aren't as clear as they should be, and that his staff needs to think on a different level if they want evidence to build this case. Motives for why others would have wanted to kill JFK are questioned, and eventually he is able to get a case against Clay Shaw as being an accessory to the president's murder.The film seemingly questions many different theories about what could have actually happened that day. For instance, Garrison questions over how 3 shots could have been fired in 6 seconds. He also excavates the shoddy job of investigation immediately after the president was killed. Oswald's role in the crime is debated, whether he could have been a decoy or fall guy for someone else, and Garrison questions some of the testimonies of the witnesses immediately following the shooting, namely Oswald's wife.The film also depicts the violent and tumultuous times that were the 1960s, and equates them with JFK's assassination. Not only was JFK targeted, but other leaders such as Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King were killed during this era. The chaos and disorder and ultimate disbelief that were experienced by Americans during this time period are a statement as to how our outlooks can change in a relatively brief time when facing difficulties and painful moments.Oliver Stone's film, as daring and controversial as it is, is quite an engrossing and powerful epic. The larger than life quality of the film is only minimized by the significant event it is investigating, and losing our president on that day was certainly a shocking tragedy to Americans. JFK is one of those rare movies that should be seen by everyone, whether you agree with its theories or not.",5,Powerful and engrossing epic about the JFK conspiracy,1167696000,"01 2, 2007",2007,4157,"['Director', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'perhaps', 'most', 'ambitious', 'controversial', 'work', 'laden', 'all-star', 'cast', 'including', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'John', 'Candy', 'Jack', 'Lemon', 'Ed', 'Asner', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'Michael', 'Rooker', 'Joe', 'Pesci', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'Walter', 'Matthau', 'others', 'Stone', 'seemingly', 'big', 'deal', 'film', 'film', 'grandiose', 'nature', 'intended', 'big', 'moment', 'American', 'history', 'hate', 'are', 'many', 'reviewers', 'sides', 'fence', 'film', 'engrossing', 'fascinating', 'captivating', 'terms', 'production', 'director', ""n't"", 'seemingly', 'leave', 'rock', 'unturned', 'type', 'explanation', 'what', 'happened', 'before', 'assassination', 'JFK', 'many', 'may', 'disagree', 'theories', 'depicted', 'film', 'larger', 'question', 'film', 'seemingly', 'not', 'only', 'JFK', 'America', 'What', 'What', 'things', 'were', 'presented', 'assassination', 'were', ""n't"", 'crystal', 'clear', 'had', 'thought', 'were', 'JFK', 'certainly', 'forefront', 'important', 'day', 'American', 'history', 'questions', 'nature', 'what', 'real', 'what', 'illusion', 'reasons', 'feel', 'film', 'everyone', 'should', 'see.Kevin', 'Costner', 'portrayal', 'Jim', 'Garrison', 'outstanding', 'very', 'essence', 'man', 'who', 'questions', 'why', 'Kennedy', 'died', 'day', 'Dallas', 'investigation', 'momentous', 'own', 'right', 'also', 'not', 'popular', 'one', 'public', 'eye', 'assassination', 'apart', 'piece', 'piece', 'not', 'only', 'who', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'present', 'implicated', 'way', 'event', 'entire', 'time', 'frame', 'beforehand', 'leading', 'up', 'assassination', 'only', 'make', 'head', 'way', 'when', 'ruffle', 'feathers', 'such', 'investigation', 'CIA', 'FBI', 'even', 'Congress', 'also', 'able', 'reconstruct', 'time', 'table', 'whereabouts', 'Lee', 'Harvey', 'Oswald', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'Garrison', 'tirelessly', 'laboriously', 'point', 'where', 'not', 'only', 'support', 'also', 'family', 'life', 'man', 'obsessed', 'discovering', 'truth', 'Garrison', 'best', 'when', 'talking', 'reporters', 'Let', 'justice', 'be', 'done', 'heavens', 'fall', 'Garrison', 'able', 'get', 'question', 'key', 'figures', 'case', 'such', 'Clay', 'Shaw', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'David', 'Ferry', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'man', 'who', 'name', 'X', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'Garrison', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'clear', 'should', 'be', 'staff', 'think', 'different', 'level', 'want', 'evidence', 'build', 'case', 'Motives', 'why', 'others', 'would', 'have', 'wanted', 'kill', 'JFK', 'are', 'questioned', 'eventually', 'able', 'get', 'case', 'Clay', 'Shaw', 'being', 'accessory', 'president', 'murder.The', 'film', 'seemingly', 'questions', 'many', 'different', 'theories', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'actually', 'happened', 'day', 'instance', 'Garrison', 'questions', 'how', '3', 'shots', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'fired', '6', 'seconds', 'also', 'shoddy', 'job', 'investigation', 'immediately', 'president', 'was', 'killed', 'Oswald', 'role', 'crime', 'debated', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'decoy', 'fall', 'guy', 'someone', 'else', 'Garrison', 'questions', 'testimonies', 'witnesses', 'immediately', 'following', 'shooting', 'namely', 'Oswald', 'wife.The', 'film', 'also', 'violent', 'tumultuous', 'times', 'were', '1960s', 'JFK', 'assassination', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'JFK', 'targeted', 'other', 'leaders', 'such', 'Robert', 'Kennedy', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'King', 'were', 'killed', 'era', 'chaos', 'disorder', 'ultimate', 'disbelief', 'were', 'experienced', 'Americans', 'time', 'period', 'are', 'statement', 'how', 'outlooks', 'can', 'change', 'relatively', 'brief', 'time', 'when', 'facing', 'difficulties', 'painful', 'moments.Oliver', 'Stone', 'film', 'daring', 'controversial', 'quite', 'engrossing', 'powerful', 'epic', 'larger', 'life', 'quality', 'film', 'only', 'minimized', 'significant', 'event', 'investigating', 'losing', 'president', 'day', 'was', 'certainly', 'shocking', 'tragedy', 'Americans', 'JFK', 'one', 'rare', 'movies', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'everyone', 'agree', 'theories', 'not']",JFK Director's Cut

93249,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,0790729733,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[4, 5]","In 1969, New Orleans D.A. Jim Garrison brought noted New Orleans businessman Clay Shaw to trial for conspiracy to murder President John F. Kennedy. To date, this is the only trial of any individual in reference to the Kennedy assasination.  This controversial 1991 film follows Garrison's investigation into the Kennedy assasination from the day of Kennedy's death to the conclusion of the trial--and it has prompted almost as much controversy as the assasination itself.How much of this film are we to take as fact and how much of it are we take as fiction?  Critics have noted that as a historian, Stone is a great filmmaker, and with JFK Stone creates a vision so extreme that even some conspiracy theorists have denounced it as completely impossible.  But that may actually be part of the film's point: that we live in a society that typically subverts the truth, a world in which facts are hard to come by and in which speculation runs wild.However you wish to take the film, there's no denying that it is exceptionally well done.  Much of its power rests on visuals.  JFK is presented on different film stocks with various grains and color qualities, and these scenes--some of them lasting only seconds--are combined like pieces of an jigsaw puzzle to create a slowly emerging picture of American politics at its worst. The script, largely based on Garrison's book ON THE TRAIL OF THE ASSASINS, works in much the same fashion, shifting rapidly from scene to scene and back and forth in time. In combination, cinematography and script have a cumulative power that is most impressive, and Williams' haunting score adds greatly to the effect.The ensemble cast is easily one of the best I've ever seen. Kevin Costner is not, perhaps, ideally cast as Jim Garrison--but he plays in an extremely low-key manner completely devoid of any ""star"" trappings, and thus throws focus on the myriad of characters who swirl through the story. Gary Oldman is uncanny as Lee Harvey Oswald. His performance is such that you're often unsure if you watching Oldman or news footage of Oswald, and Brian Doyle-Murray achieves a similar effect with the smaller role of Jack Ruby.But perhaps the most memorable are the host of actors who appear in unlikely roles and who aquit themselves exceptionally well. Joe Pesci gives a typically aggressive performance in the strange role of a right-wing paramilitary homosexual, Kevin Bacon is completely unexpected and flawless as a hard-bitten gay prostitute, and Tommy Lee Jones is impressive as the influential Clay Shaw. Other memorable performers include Ed Asner, Jack Lemmon, Sissy Spacek, Laurie Metcalf, Sally Kirkland, and Donald Sutherland--and in a wicked twist of irony Jim Garrison himself appears as Justice Earl Warren.The package includes a number of extras, including an often interesting director's commentary, an interview with famous conspiracy theorist Prouty, and a documentary on certain intriguing records recently declassified by Congress as a direct result of this film's impact. Then there is the film itself, which includes several previously cut scenes and which is extremely well transferred to DVD.Historians and theorists will probably wrangle over the JFK assasination for decades, perhaps centuries to come. But whether you buy into Oliver Stone's scenario in whole, in part, or not at all, film is both extremely well-done and provocative to the max. If you want to stir conversation, this will do it.

93250,AU10YGO10MUCA,0790729733,Gary Lee,"[2, 3]","Oliver Stone's Guide to All Things Conspiritorial grabs the viewer by the throat from the very first image and shakes you like a pit bull to very end.  It's a fast-moving, compelling plunge through the darkest underbelly of American life and shadow politics.Not a word of it makes much sense.But it's a great introduction to what has had conspiracy theorists in a mad huff for the past half century.  It touches in an almost encyclopedic way on the unresolved issues regarding the death of John F. Kennedy (which is, pretty much, everything--even where it occurred.  Dallas is, in effect, trying to pretend ""It didn't happen here"" in the official ceremonies the city is unhappily planning for the 50th anniversary this November).Don't take Stone's word for it--go dig into the facts for yourself, which is definitely what this polemic will stimulate thoughtful viewers to do.As filmmaking, I hope editors Hutshing and Scalia, who won an Oscar, were paid overtime.  Friends tell me the swirling camera movements in BEASTS OF THE SOUTHERN WILD made them nauseous.  But the strobe-like, relentless cutting in JFK could induce an epileptic fit.  To keep this dry, expository, and dated subject fresh and alive, Stone edits the picture like a man on speed.  Some images move so fast that they are virtually subliminal.Does the razzle-dazzle serve a purpose?  Or is it just sleight-of-hand to keep the viewer off-base and unlikely to detect some of the inconsistencies in the barrage of information the screenplay hurls at the audience?  The viewer will have to decide.  There is little time for sober reflection while experiencing this movie.  Just hang on for the roller coaster ride, and try to figure it all out later.  Mr. Stone has assigned the viewer some major homework:  not only figure out the assassination mess, but figure out this movie.As drama, perhaps what works least well are the scenes depicting New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison's personal life.  The story casts Garrison as Everyman, encouraging the viewer to share his growing realization that the official version of JFK's death as the work of a lone assassin is bogus.  For us to identify with him, Stone wants us to see Garrison as a regular guy with a loving wife and family (whom he proceeds to ignore as he is drawn deeper into the case). But Garrison, the only person who has ever prosecuted anyone for the murder of the 35th President of the United States, was anything but ordinary.  He was eccentric and obessesed, and in the end, spectacularly unsuccessful in his quest to convict New Orleans businessman Clay Shaw of heading a conspiracy to kill Kennedy.  History has largely dismissed Garrison and his quixotic quest as lunatic.  Stone's attempt to sanitize Garrison into a bland family man and turn him into a national hero simply lacks interest in contrast to the headlong rush of vital importance given to the detective aspects of the story.  The domestic stuff gives the viewer some breathing room, but seems lifeless and dramatically imbalanced by comparison.JFK is nearly unavoidable for anyone who is interested in the assassination, regardless of whoever the viewer thinks did it.  Thus, Stone is probably due kudos--albeit reluctantly--for reframing and revitalizing the debate with his film made 28 years after that tragic day in Dallas.",5,Enthralling--But Don't Stop Here,1374192000,"07 19, 2013",2013,3335,"['Oliver', 'Stone', 'Guide', 'All', 'Things', 'Conspiritorial', 'grabs', 'viewer', 'throat', 'very', 'first', 'image', 'shakes', 'pit', 'bull', 'very', 'end', 'fast-moving', 'compelling', 'plunge', 'darkest', 'underbelly', 'American', 'life', 'shadow', 'politics.Not', 'word', 'much', 'sense.But', 'great', 'introduction', 'what', 'had', 'conspiracy', 'theorists', 'mad', 'huff', 'past', 'half', 'century', 'almost', 'encyclopedic', 'way', 'unresolved', 'issues', 'regarding', 'death', 'John', 'F.', 'Kennedy', 'pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'even', 'where', 'occurred', 'Dallas', 'effect', 'trying', 'pretend', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'here', 'official', 'ceremonies', 'city', 'unhappily', 'planning', '50th', 'anniversary', 'November', '.Do', ""n't"", 'take', 'Stone', 'word', 'go', 'dig', 'facts', 'definitely', 'what', 'polemic', 'will', 'stimulate', 'thoughtful', 'viewers', 'do.As', 'filmmaking', 'hope', 'editors', 'Hutshing', 'Scalia', 'who', 'won', 'Oscar', 'were', 'paid', 'overtime', 'Friends', 'tell', 'swirling', 'camera', 'movements', 'BEASTS', 'THE', 'SOUTHERN', 'WILD', 'made', 'nauseous', 'strobe-like', 'relentless', 'cutting', 'JFK', 'could', 'induce', 'epileptic', 'fit', 'keep', 'dry', 'expository', 'dated', 'subject', 'fresh', 'alive', 'Stone', 'picture', 'man', 'speed', 'images', 'move', 'so', 'fast', 'are', 'virtually', 'razzle-dazzle', 'serve', 'purpose', 'just', 'sleight-of-hand', 'keep', 'viewer', 'off-base', 'unlikely', 'detect', 'inconsistencies', 'barrage', 'information', 'screenplay', 'hurls', 'audience', 'viewer', 'will', 'have', 'decide', 'little', 'time', 'sober', 'reflection', 'experiencing', 'movie', 'Just', 'hang', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'later', 'Mr.', 'Stone', 'assigned', 'viewer', 'major', 'homework', 'not', 'only', 'figure', 'out', 'assassination', 'mess', 'figure', 'out', 'movie.As', 'drama', 'perhaps', 'what', 'least', 'well', 'are', 'scenes', 'depicting', 'New', 'Orleans', 'District', 'Attorney', 'Jim', 'Garrison', 'personal', 'life', 'story', 'Garrison', 'Everyman', 'encouraging', 'viewer', 'share', 'growing', 'realization', 'official', 'version', 'JFK', 'death', 'work', 'lone', 'assassin', 'bogus', 'identify', 'Stone', 'see', 'Garrison', 'regular', 'guy', 'loving', 'wife', 'family', 'whom', 'ignore', 'drawn', 'case', 'Garrison', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'ever', 'prosecuted', 'anyone', 'murder', '35th', 'President', 'United', 'States', 'was', 'anything', 'ordinary', 'was', 'eccentric', 'obessesed', 'end', 'spectacularly', 'unsuccessful', 'quest', 'convict', 'New', 'Orleans', 'businessman', 'Clay', 'Shaw', 'heading', 'conspiracy', 'kill', 'Kennedy', 'History', 'largely', 'dismissed', 'Garrison', 'quixotic', 'quest', 'lunatic', 'Stone', 'attempt', 'sanitize', 'Garrison', 'bland', 'family', 'man', 'turn', 'national', 'hero', 'simply', 'interest', 'contrast', 'headlong', 'rush', 'vital', 'importance', 'given', 'detective', 'aspects', 'story', 'domestic', 'stuff', 'viewer', 'breathing', 'room', 'lifeless', 'dramatically', 'imbalanced', 'comparison.JFK', 'nearly', 'unavoidable', 'anyone', 'who', 'interested', 'assassination', 'regardless', 'whoever', 'viewer', 'did', 'Thus', 'Stone', 'probably', 'due', 'kudos', 'albeit', 'reluctantly', 'reframing', 'revitalizing', 'debate', 'film', 'made', '28', 'years', 'tragic', 'day', 'Dallas']",JFK Director's Cut

Some people think that even if you don't believe the conspiracy theories about the JFK assassination, it is worth seeing this film because ""it makes you think"".  The tragedy of this view is that it destroys people's belief that there is something like ""the Truth"" and encourages mental laziness by not pushing people to look at the evidence, and the evidence clearly shows that the Warren Commissions conclusions about the roles of Oswald and Ruby are correct.  Many former ""conspiracy buffs"" like Norman Mailer and Gus Russo did this and admitted they had been wrong.Oliver Stone's disregard of the truth is appalling.  First off, JFK and RFK were no ""liberal saints"" that were out to overturn a ""corrupt establishment"".  JFK was the best friend the ""military/industrial complex"" ever had.  He poured huge amounts of money into it by carrying out the biggest peacetime military build-up in history and by giving the go-ahead for the Apollo program to put a man on the Moon by 1970.  JFK moved very cautiously on civil rights and appointed segregations judges to the Federal Courts.  After the Bay of Pigs, he felt the CIA should be more tightly controlled and so he put in brother, Attorney General Robert Kennedy as unofficial overseer of the organization, taking a VERY active role in Operation Mongoose which was to remove Castro from power in Cuba, by assassination if necessary.  Kennedy was making contradictory statements about Vietnam, but there was no real indication he had a concrete plan to pull out, and it must be remembered that President Eisenhower also decided in 1954 not to get involved in helping the French there, thus allowing a Communist takeover of North Vietnam and yet the CIA and the Establishment didn't decide to rub him out. We see that JFK and RFK were no threat to the ""establishment"" and even if he was, they could have easily gotten rid of them by leaking information about JFKs poor health or  his scandalous womanizing involving women who had Mafia or East German connections, all of which FBI Director J Edgar Hoover and many others including journalists knew about but handled discreetely, so there was no need to come up with the ridiculous assassination scheme Stone invents in this film.In the ridiculous trial of Clay Shaw (who was acquitted by the jury after only a few minutes deliberation-showing how effective a prosecutor that charlatan Jim Garrison was) Garrison quickly points out that there were ""several teams of shooters"" in Dealey Plaza.  Where is there any shred of evidence of this?  Yet, this is presented as fact.  This is symptomatic of everything that is wrong with this genre of film.  It is unfortunate that this anti-intellectualism and cynicism is spreading throughout modern society leading to things like Holocaust denial, racism, support for international terrorism and the like.  I hope everyone takes note of this and steers clear of this film and its ilk.",1,Entertaining Drivel,1100649600,"11 17, 2004",2004,3015,"['Okay', 'film', 'very', 'entertaining', ""'ve"", 'said', 'Now', 'serious', 'stuff', 'people', 'think', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'JFK', 'assassination', 'worth', 'seeing', 'film', 'think', 'tragedy', 'view', 'people', 'belief', 'something', 'Truth', 'mental', 'laziness', 'not', 'pushing', 'people', 'look', 'evidence', 'evidence', 'clearly', 'Warren', 'Commissions', 'conclusions', 'roles', 'Oswald', 'Ruby', 'are', 'correct', 'Many', 'former', 'conspiracy', 'buffs', 'Norman', 'Mailer', 'Gus', 'Russo', 'did', 'admitted', 'had', 'been', 'wrong.Oliver', 'Stone', 'disregard', 'truth', 'appalling', 'First', 'JFK', 'RFK', 'were', 'liberal', 'saints', 'were', 'out', 'overturn', 'corrupt', 'establishment', 'JFK', 'was', 'best', 'friend', 'military/industrial', 'complex', 'ever', 'had', 'poured', 'huge', 'amounts', 'money', 'carrying', 'out', 'biggest', 'peacetime', 'military', 'build-up', 'history', 'giving', 'go-ahead', 'Apollo', 'program', 'put', 'man', 'Moon', '1970', 'JFK', 'moved', 'very', 'cautiously', 'civil', 'rights', 'appointed', 'segregations', 'judges', 'Federal', 'Courts', 'Bay', 'Pigs', 'felt', 'CIA', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'tightly', 'controlled', 'so', 'put', 'brother', 'Attorney', 'General', 'Robert', 'Kennedy', 'unofficial', 'overseer', 'organization', 'taking', 'VERY', 'active', 'role', 'Operation', 'Mongoose', 'was', 'remove', 'Castro', 'power', 'Cuba', 'assassination', 'necessary', 'Kennedy', 'was', 'making', 'contradictory', 'statements', 'Vietnam', 'was', 'real', 'indication', 'had', 'concrete', 'plan', 'pull', 'out', 'must', 'be', 'remembered', 'President', 'Eisenhower', 'also', 'decided', '1954', 'not', 'get', 'involved', 'helping', 'French', 'there', 'thus', 'allowing', 'Communist', 'takeover', 'North', 'Vietnam', 'yet', 'CIA', 'Establishment', 'did', ""n't"", 'decide', 'rub', 'out', 'see', 'JFK', 'RFK', 'were', 'threat', 'establishment', 'even', 'was', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'gotten', 'rid', 'leaking', 'information', 'JFKs', 'poor', 'health', 'scandalous', 'womanizing', 'involving', 'women', 'who', 'had', 'Mafia', 'East', 'German', 'connections', 'FBI', 'Director', 'J', 'Edgar', 'Hoover', 'many', 'others', 'including', 'journalists', 'knew', 'handled', 'discreetely', 'was', 'need', 'come', 'up', 'ridiculous', 'assassination', 'scheme', 'Stone', 'film.In', 'ridiculous', 'trial', 'Clay', 'Shaw', 'who', 'was', 'acquitted', 'jury', 'only', 'few', 'minutes', 'deliberation-showing', 'how', 'effective', 'prosecutor', 'Jim', 'Garrison', 'was', 'Garrison', 'quickly', 'out', 'were', 'several', 'teams', 'shooters', 'Dealey', 'Plaza', 'Where', 'there', 'shred', 'evidence', 'Yet', 'presented', 'fact', 'symptomatic', 'everything', 'wrong', 'genre', 'film', 'unfortunate', 'anti-intellectualism', 'cynicism', 'spreading', 'modern', 'society', 'leading', 'things', 'Holocaust', 'denial', 'racism', 'support', 'international', 'terrorism', 'like', 'hope', 'everyone', 'note', 'steers', 'clear', 'film', 'ilk']",JFK Director's Cut

93256,A2UYAFQ40U2PHS,0790729733,"Grigory's Girl ""GR""","[2, 2]","If you jettison the politics of this movie (and Stone's reputation as a muckracker), and simply look at JFK as a film, it's arguably Oliver Stone's best film and it is absolutely rivetting.  It's a masterpiece of cinemtography, editing, writing, and performances.  I've only seen the initial 189 minute theatrical version, and that film is my favorite Oliver Stone film.  Stone's scope of this project is incredible.  He not only makes an epic about the JFK assassination, but he makes it so fascinating and enthralling that you marvel as his talents as a filmmaker.  The cinematography here is astounding.  Robert Richardson shoots in 35mm, 8mm, and 16mm, color, black and white, tinted color, tinted black and white, and it all blends seamlessly.  The editing on this monster is also a marvel (it deservedly won an Oscar for editing).  The film has a ton of cuts (something in films I don't like), but Stone and his editors do wonders with it.  The performances deserve special mention as well.  Costner is very effective as Jim Garrison, the New Orleans prosecutor who believed in the conspiracy of JFK's assassination.  Costner does a New Orleans accent very well, much better than his rather pathetic ""English"" one for Robin Hood:  Prince of Thieves.  There are numerous cameos in the film, but they don't feel like cameos.  Stone manages to make each actor/character unique and interesting.  It never feels like star spotting.  Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Kevin Bacon, Donald Sutherland, Joe Pesci, and Ed Asner (as a right wing demogagoue, which is funny considering Asner is a very left wing liberal) are standouts in a magnificent cast.When you watch this film, think of it as ""Stone's interpretation of the JFK assassination"".  There are numerous discrepancies here (such as Garrison meeting with Mr. X, played by Sutherland.  That never happened), but if you look at this film strictly as a film, it's remarkable and worthy of the accolades it has received over the years.  It's one of Oliver Stone's most memorable films, and a reminder of what a great director he can be when he's on.",5,"In terms of pure filmmaking, this film is a masterpiece....",1217289600,"07 29, 2008",2008,2098,"['jettison', 'politics', 'movie', 'Stone', 'reputation', 'muckracker', 'simply', 'look', 'JFK', 'film', 'arguably', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'best', 'film', 'absolutely', 'rivetting', 'masterpiece', 'cinemtography', 'editing', 'writing', 'performances', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', 'initial', '189', 'minute', 'theatrical', 'version', 'film', 'favorite', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'film', 'Stone', 'scope', 'project', 'incredible', 'not', 'only', 'epic', 'JFK', 'assassination', 'fascinating', 'enthralling', 'marvel', 'talents', 'filmmaker', 'cinematography', 'here', 'astounding', 'Robert', 'Richardson', 'shoots', '35mm', '8mm', '16mm', 'color', 'black', 'white', 'tinted', 'color', 'tinted', 'black', 'white', 'seamlessly', 'editing', 'monster', 'also', 'marvel', 'deservedly', 'won', 'Oscar', 'editing', 'film', 'ton', 'cuts', 'something', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Stone', 'editors', 'do', 'wonders', 'performances', 'deserve', 'special', 'mention', 'as', 'well', 'Costner', 'very', 'effective', 'Jim', 'Garrison', 'New', 'Orleans', 'prosecutor', 'who', 'believed', 'conspiracy', 'JFK', 'assassination', 'Costner', 'New', 'Orleans', 'accent', 'very', 'well', 'much', 'better', 'rather', 'pathetic', 'English', 'one', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'Prince', 'Thieves', 'are', 'numerous', 'cameos', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'cameos', 'Stone', 'make', 'actor/character', 'unique', 'interesting', 'never', 'star', 'spotting', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'Walter', 'Matthau', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'Joe', 'Pesci', 'Ed', 'Asner', 'right', 'wing', 'demogagoue', 'funny', 'considering', 'Asner', 'very', 'left', 'wing', 'liberal', 'are', 'standouts', 'magnificent', 'cast.When', 'watch', 'film', 'think', 'Stone', 'interpretation', 'JFK', 'assassination', 'are', 'numerous', 'discrepancies', 'here', 'such', 'Garrison', 'meeting', 'Mr.', 'X', 'played', 'Sutherland', 'never', 'happened', 'look', 'film', 'strictly', 'film', 'remarkable', 'worthy', 'accolades', 'received', 'years', 'one', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'most', 'memorable', 'films', 'reminder', 'what', 'great', 'director', 'can', 'be', 'when']",JFK Director's Cut

93259,A1VDA6GS3N714H,0790729733,"Guy Denutte ""A concerned citizen""","[8, 9]","If you ever thought about Eisenhower's wise words in his farewell speech : ""beware of the military-industrial complex"", and kept wondering what he really meant, well, look at this film.  President Kennedy wanted a Pax Americana for the world.  (By the way, when was the last time you ever heard those words ?)  President Kennedy wanted to make peace with the Soviet Union, and he wanted to retreat all troops from Vietnam by 1965.  The day after he was killed, Johnson took over and immediately sent more troops to Vietnam.  The US would stay there till 1975.  The war was lost in human and political terms, but the ""military-industrial"" complex got richer and more powerful.  Bell sold their helicopters, General Dynamics their fighters, etc.  War is the biggest industry in the US, but the public doesn't know how it works.  We aren't allowed to know, because of ""national security"".  So there's a lot of money to be made, since furthermore, there's no sharp line to be drawn between the military ordering equipment and the industry offering it.This film is very important.  It shows the exact point in history when the US lost the very significance of its democracy.  Since then, the US are an evil empire, where foreign politics doesn't depend on the personal ideas of the elected president, but on what the military-industrial complex wants.  Obama already said he would increase the defense budget.  He also said he wanted to retreat troops from Iraq, but immediately added that the situation in Afghanistan merits more attention.  Obama promised change, but he didn't even remove the secretary of Defense of Bush !  What kind of change is this ?  In his place, I would be scared to death also.  Remember Kennedy fired Dulles from the CIA, and who ""helped"" trying finding out who killed president Kennedy in the Warren commission ?  Yeah, precisely : his good old buddy Dulles...  What kind of ""democracy"" is this ?This film shows in quite some detail how the conspiracy was forged.  To begin with, all standard security procedures were violated.  The major of Dallas changed the route of the presidential car, so that it included a slow turn.  A lonely shooter was blamed, and killed before the public could hear him say he really worked for the military intelligence - where he was taught Russian and was sent to Russia as a double agent.  He just managed to say to the cameras he was ""a patsy"".  Then Ruby, Oswald's killer, was injected with cancer cells, so he couldn't tell who was ordering him.  Immediately after the killing of Kennedy, CBS reported that ""president Kennedy was hit by three shots"" !  How did they know that ?  Who said that anyway ?  It was false, to begin with.  The Zapruderfilm showed there were at least six shots !  And to prevent the truth to emerge, the autopsy of Kennedy was interrupted by some admirals, taking the corpse away to Washington, where the brain of Kennedy ""was lost"" and the photos of his dead body manipulated.  More intriguing is that in New Zealand the newspapers had the full story of Oswald and his fake biography four hours before he was actually charged with the murder of the president, following Colonel Fletcher Prouty, X in the film, and author of the book ""JFK - The CIA, Vietnam and the plot to assassinate John F. Kennedy"".Hitler said in ""Mein Kampf"" : The bigger the lie, the more credibility it gets, ""since it would never come into the heads of the people to fabricate colossal untruths, and they would not believe that others could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously. Even though the facts which prove this to be so may be brought clearly to their minds, they will still doubt and waver and will continue to think that there may be some other explanation.""Ambassador Joseph Wilson said : ""... a majority of Americans, wanting to trust in the president and his words, actually came to believe that Saddam had nuclear weapons and was somehow responsible for the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.""Now, in the fake democracy the US is nowadays, it seems very likely that even 9/11 was orchestrated by the military-industrial complex.  I know you'll probably have problems believing this.  I had trouble to believe it myself, I'll tell you.  Hear me out, and above all : compare with what happened to Kennedy.  To begin with, the murderer was immediately identified.  No need to go through a thorough investigation.  Osama bin Laden was blamed immediately by Bush.  How did they know that ?  This is very weird, taking into consideration that the intelligence was apparently a total mess, since those attacks happened in the first place.  Now, as happened in the case of Oswald, Osama bin Laden was CIA, and the saying goes : once CIA, always CIA.  Now, if you have a suspect, like Osama bin Laden, then it's even stranger that you let all his family members fly away on 9/12, when not a single other plane in the US was allowed to fly.  Probably, like with Oswald, the military-industrial complex was not interested that the public became aware of the connections Osama bin Laden still had with the CIA, or maybe they didn't want to reveal the relationship of the Bush and the bin Laden families, shown by Michael Moore in his film Fahrenheit 9/11.  What's for sure is that the White House wasn't interested in a investigation.  George W. Bush also interfered with Congress investigating the attacks, saying - on the record, see Fahrenheit 9/11 : ""It's important for us not to reveal how we collect information.  That's what the enemy wants.""We also have a clear problem with some ""evidence"" that was shown to all of us on 9/11.  They told us the Pentagon was hit by a plane.  Have you ever taken a close look to the small hole that was made in the building ?  This is far too small for a large 767.  There weren't any remains of a fuselage, the motors, the wings, no, nothing at all, let alone some bodies...  Compare with any other plane crash you have seen photos of...To make the similarities with the Kennedy assassination complete, it is also very intriguing that the BBC announced the collapse of the Solomon Brothers Building (WTC7), a huge skyscraper, 23 minutes before it actually happened !  Even worse, when they announced it, you could still see the building erect on the live images behind the speaker.  Don't believe me.  I don't ask you that.  I prefer you check it out for yourself : do a web search with the words ""Solomon brothers collapse BBC"".Now, the collapse of the Solomon Brothers building is at the same time the ""magic bullet mystery"" of 9/11.  I do not know of any law or force in nature that when two skyscrapers collapse, it will always take a third skyscraper down.  In this way, the Solomon Brothers represents the ""magic collapse mystery"" of 9/11.As with the Kennedy killing, we have to look beyond the facts, and ask WHY this happened, and take a look on the consequences of this ""attack"".  The list is as follows : (1) the war in Afghanistan, (2) the invasion of Iraq, (3) the Patriot Act, limiting our democratic, civil rights and (4) the Guant&aacute;namo prison, where people were jailed without legal defense and even tortured.When presidents of the US draw a line between Good and Evil, I always feel uncomfortable.  We first had to be aware of the Soviet Union, the ""Evil Empire"".  Now, Iraq, Iran and North Korea are considered the ""Axis of Evil"".

The acting is truly superb and despite the length of the movie it is never boring.  The characters are very compelling and it is a true ensemble cast with a lot of great cameo performances.So why the 3 star rating?  Shortly before I left for Thailand I saw a documentary on either the Discovery channel, A&E;, or the History channel sorry I can't remember which.  This documentary was basically done in a myth busters fashion going point for point over all of the conspiracy theories regarding JFK's assassination.  They use all of the material Stone and the cosnpiracy theorists used and nothing new.  They expose where facts were misrepresented and also where they were fabricated.It was truly outstanding.  They recreated the shooting.  Showing LHO would have had a couple extra seconds to fire and most likely fired the first shot before the tree rather than after it.  A couple of shooters were also brought in and shot within the original time frame and the new time frame.  Only one person fell slightly outside the original time frame and that is because his rifle jammed.  He recovered and fired quickly.They show the actual balistics of the firing and use real experts to do this.  There was no magic bullet of any sort.  No extra shooters from the grassy knoll.  One shooter could have easily and most likely have done all of the firing.The escape down the stairway was not only accomplished it was accomplished rather easily.  In fact one could have done it twice in the allotted time.  The people doing this were only in fair shape and were not winded at all.The escape from the boarding house was also discredited.  If you look at the witness statements none clearly saw LHO walk the established route.  Stone uses testimony from a very old and near sighted lady as his concrete evidence.  If you take the more plausible routes that LHO would have taken then he would have made it with plenty of time.Why was Jack Ruby there to shoot LHO?  Jack Ruby was well known to always carry a pistol.  He was at the same place paying off a fine of some sort and decided to take his place in history.  He was there for a reason and not to kill LHO.The documentary was awesome and changed my mind completely on the events surrounding JFK's assassination.  I highly recommend watching it.  I just wish I could remember its name.  The movie is still fun to watch to get a feel for all the speculation that went into the assasination.

93271,A1FGG93X6HT374,0790729733,James O'Blivion,"[7, 8]","First off, I will state that this is a fabulous piece of film-making.  The direction is strong, the period recreation is amazing, the editing is mind-blowing, and the cast is phenomenal...particularly Gary Oldman as Lee Harvey Oswald.  His performance is right on key and he looks incredibly similar to Oswald...just as he looked like Sid Vicious in &quot;Sid and Nancy&quot; and Ludwig Van Beethoven in &quot;Immortal Beloved.&quot;  Oldman is a chameleon who can seemingly look like anyone.  He becomes the characters that he plays, and his turn as Oswald is no exception.  Now...on to the substance of the film.  This film is not 100% accurate, nor does it purport to be anything other than an educated guess as to what MAY have happened in Dallas on November 22, 1963.  It is, however, leaps and bounds ahead of the Warren Commission Report, which isn't even believable in the slightest.  I may not be convinced that this film's vision of the truth (based on books by Jim Garrison and Jim Marrs) is the whole truth and nothing but the truth, but I've done my own research and I find it to be far closer to a believable theory than that proposed by the Warren Commission, whose report was...let's face facts, America...pure fiction.  Anyone who believes that lone nut Lee Harvey Oswald killed JFK needs to take his or her blinders off and start living in the real world.  Still, one cannot say that Oswald (one of the most fascinating characters in American history) was not capable of amazing feats...like simultaneously being active in the Soviet Union and the United States...though that's easily explained when one takes the time to find a copy of the memo sent from J. Edgar Hoover himself to the Department of State on June 3, 1960, which reads in part &quot;Since there is the possibility that an imposter is using Oswald's birth certificate, any current information the Department of State may have concerning the subject will be appreciated.&quot;  There you have it...as far back as 1960, there were at least two Lee Harvey Oswalds running around.  Not to mention that the LHO who was treated for tonsillitis twice during his stint with the Marines was obviously not the LHO who had his tonsils removed at the age of six.  Nor was the LHO who had a 3-inch mastoidectomy scar behind his ear and a gunshot scar on his elbow the same LHO who was autopsied after being gunned down by Jack Ruby.  There were AT LEAST two Oswalds active at the time of JFK's assassination...and many eyewitnesses have stated that they saw the police escorting Lee Harvey Oswald out of the rear exit of the Texas Theatre at the very same time that the Lee Harvey Oswald who was charged with JFK's murder was being led out the front.  It is, therefore, possible that while Oswald's double (who is said to have resembled the real Oswald a great deal) may have been involved in the assassination and killed officer J.D. Tippitt, the real Oswald was taken into custody, while his double was led out the back of the very same theatre and set free.  At any rate, there is a wealth of information out there, waiting to be discovered.  My advice is to watch this brilliant film, but not to take it at face value.  While you're at it, read up on the assassination.  Start with &quot;Crossfire&quot; by Jim Marrs, and once you've made it through that lengthy volume, move onto other independent research.

The distance that Oswald had to shoot from was considered 'Expert range'.  Oswald was not a prize marksman.  And he was using a mediocre weapon.  They had experts shoot the same distance with the same type of gun and they could barely make the shot on 90% of the attempts.  Oliver Stone's depiction is riveting, no doubt, but I'm sure he takes plenty of liberties.  He is liberal as hell and loves to create controversy.  The movie is still full of real facts, including the reaction of Kennedy's body when he was shot and the muzzle flash from the knoll.  THERE WAS DEFINITELY ANOTHER PERSON SHOOTING AT KENNEDY'S CAR.  There are other facts that raise a lot of questions as well.  The route of the motorcade, Oswalds motive, Ruby's death.  If you want to create an opinion, get information from more than one source.  This debate has been going on for a long time and we know there have been cover ups and undisclosed information.  Posner's book is most likely a jaded and one sided opinion.  The movie is fantastic, it makes you ask a lot of questions.  Good performances, one of Costner's best, with a very good accent.  John Candy makes a suprising and impressive dramatic turn.  All others; Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Bacon, Joe Pesci, Sissy Spacek, Donald Sutherland and Gary Oldman all contribute greatly and make this a facinating movie based on historical fact.

It is a pastiche - a collage - but I can tell you as a longtime Kennedy researcher and everything in the movie is real and accurate and factual and happened - EXCEPT for the meeting with Donald Sutherland in Washington - that never happened. Jim Garrison did not have a 'Deep Throat' to help him or guide his way, and his self-aggrandizing manner is not even touched on in the movie - the main reason he was so discredited and dismissed as a crank just trying to get publicity for himself - it was the way he went about it - and if you read some of his quotes, they do this movie no service. But Oliver Stone does not know who killed JFK - he just knows how it DIDNT happen, that our own government lied to us and covered it up, and that we are ALL owed as Americans to know who killed our president and why. When the National Archives are finally opened up and we can see all of the thousands (seriously, literally, guys, if you don't know look it up) of documents that are STILL deemed 'too sensitive' for us to see and interpret ourselves - lest we get the wrong impression of our way of life, our government, our country, our legacy, and our meaning to the rest of the world - it's that big.

93283,AM5WLF25DW3XU,0790729733,Joe Comer,"[5, 6]","There is much to be said about this film.  For one thing, it is, in this reviewer's opinion, the best film of the 1990's.  Nearly every frame is loaded with huge amounts of information.  And regardless of what you have heard, with the exception of a few minor changes, it IS accurate  information.  As  director Oliver Stone had said in reponse to the critics  of JFK, a filmmaker must be allowed a certain amount of creative license.  After all, were the best biographical films before and since acclaimed for  their factual truth actually perfect models of accuracy?  Not likely.  So  why the urge to single this one out?  I believe it was because of the  controversial nature of the subject and all of the negativity the Warren  Report has received.  It was, in short, an attempt to discredit all  involved (much like the Warren Commission attempted to do with many of it's  witnesses) including the instigator of the only trial in the assasination  of the 35th president of the United States.  For all the mistakes made  during said trial, Jim Garrison alone stood up to the people and  organizations that tried to keep the truth about that fateful day in 1963  from surfacing.  He and he alone is the most responsible for bringing the  other theories out in the open.  Yes, there had been many books written  that criticized the slipshod way the Warren Commission  &quot;investigated&quot;, but it was the trial of Clay Shaw in the late  60's that brought many of the speculative theories to the main stream  public for the first time.  Despite Garrison's sometimes questionable  methods, no one can deny the man his motive: to bring forth the truth in  what might very well be the crime of the century.Stone is relentless in  HIS quest for the truth, and it's this marriage of director and story that  make the film so remarkable.  In scene after scene  he reinstates  Garrison's vulnerability with the public.But this did not stop Garrison. Nor over twenty years later in  1991 did it even put a dent in the opinions of Oliver Stone.  The director  uses his connection and knowledge of the 60's that was so apparent in many  of his other films-PLATOON, BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY and THE DOORS,  particularly-to attempt to tell the absolutely mesmerizing story of the  D.A. of New Orleans' search for the facts.  He holds the viewer with a  series of superbly edited but very quick sequences that really give a DVD  player a workout.  Thank goodness for slow motion.The script wisely and  fittingly tells this story through the eyes of Garrison himself.  You  really feel the persecution he feels as he becomes more and more obsessed  with his search.  When his wife (well played by Sissy Spacek) finally  confronts Garrison with his obsession, your heart is in your throat.  It's  obvious that even with the people he had working for him, the D.A. is  basically a man alone.  In the final monologue, based on Garrison's final  address to the jury, you certainly hope he succeeds. Fortunately, Stone balances the emotions of a family torn  apart, with some stunning scenes based upon the beliefs and findings of  authors such as Garrison himself, Mark Lane, Jim Marrs and David Lifton.  For the first time we have a big budget, well exposed film that combines  all the theories together.The director's cut only further proves Garrison and Stone's  opinions.  The scene in the washroom could make even the most secure person  paranoid.  And the light banter of the talk show host (played by John  Larroquette) while interviewing the District Attorney is more evidence of  how the public and the press treated the trial.The cast is perfect.  Jack Lemmon, Ed Asner, Walter Matthau, Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Bacon and  Donald Sutherland are all familiar faces here effectively placed in roles  that range from mere guest appearances to full fledged important supporting  roles.  The lesser known actors and actresses also excel, especially Jay O  Sanders, Laurie Metcalf and Michael Rooker as Garrison's assistants.  Gary  Oldman as the doomed Lee Harvey Oswald once again proves his chameleon  abilities as an actor and disappears completely in the role.  Hard to  believe that this is the same actor who was just as convincing as the Count  in BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA and as Sid Vicious in SID AND NANCY, among  others.But it is Kevin Costner's performance as Jim Garrison that always  pulls the film together.  He is very convincing.  It's true that he doesn't  look a thing like the real Jim Garrison.  Fortunately, Costner wisely opted  to use subtle characteristics of Garrison in creating his interpretation of  the man.  The aforementioned final remarks to the jury are not only  believable for what is being said but also for Costner's convincing and  heartfelt delivery.Technically, the film couldn't be better.  The  recreation of the assasination itself, is absolutely perfect, right down to  the little girl that waved as she ran along the side of the President's  limousine just before the shots were fired.  The cinematography works well  with the Oscar winning editing, to hold the audience in the palm of it's  hand.  The atmosphere of New Orleans is beautifully felt.  John Williams  music score is another example of how the composer captures the very mood  of every film he scores.  The beautiful trumpet fanfare he composed for JFK  easily matches  anything from JAWS, STAR WARS, SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE,  E.T.-THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, SCHINDLER'S  LIST or the Indiana Jones movies.After many viewings of this film,  I can honestly say that if I would choose to sit and watch it again today,  I would still catch something I hadn't caught before.  What better reason  for owning a copy of JFK (The Director's Cut)?  It must be viewed in it's  widescreen edition.  Watching in a flat or &quot;full-screen&quot; format  doesn't do justice to the abundance of information it revels.  And the  dedication to the youth and their search for truth assures that it should  be handed down from generation to generation so that perhaps one day we  will know the whole truth.",5,Will hold you

93292,A34D06JL7LC6MU,0790729733,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[4, 5]","I hate Oliver Stone and sometimes it's for odd reasons. Like this movie. This is a great movie, I loved it. But it makes me hate Stone nonetheless. A few months ago there was a special on the History Channel about the assassination of John F. Kennedy. In it, they used a computer to determine just who killed Kennedy. After watching that program I believe that Lee Harvey Oswald was the sole assassin, the guy had actually spoke with people about how he wanted to feel important and the only way to do that was to kill a National Leader. This guy was an attention seeker. Reading a little bit into Jim Garrison, I found people who have stated that Garrison was a cruel man who bribed, drugged, and threatened people in order to get them to admit there was a conspiracy to kill JFK. This movie makes Garrison into a good guy and presents a lot of interesting theories about Kennedy's death. Theories that I haven't heard in anything else as being untrue, so I'm left to completely reverse my thinking on who killed Kennedy. But, anyway, I'll start talking about the movie. Kevin Costner, in an Oscar worthy performance, plays Jim Garrison. Garrison is a D.A. in New Orleans, who like all Americans, was shocked the day JFK was assassinated. Garrison watches the story unfold on television. Lee Harvey Oswald (Gary Oldman, who's performance is massively underrated. He should've got an Oscar nomination)is captured and then killed by a man named Jack Ruby, who was rumored to have connections with the mob. While the rest of America accepts this as what has happened, Garrison sees something wrong and launches an investigation into the death of JFK. Throughout his search, he meets people like David Ferrie (Joe Pesci), Willie O'Keefe (Kevin Bacon), and X (Donald Sutherland) who all agree that there was a conspiracy and that a man named Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones) was in on it. I don't want to give away the ending, but you probably know what happened with the Shaw case. Anyway,most of the people Garrison and his team interview wind up dead or backing out of what they said...Which ends up making this film all the more interesting. I do want to warn anyone who watches this movie to not accept all of this as fact. I don't know how much of this is true, although everything is pretty damn elaborate; but Oliver Stone has always had a reputation for ""creative licenseing"". Look at movies like Nixon, The Doors, & Alexander to see that. Nixon suggested that Richard Nixon knew something about the assassination of JFK. The Doors suggested that Jim Morrison was a blabbering idiot with an indian frequently coming in and out of his body. Oh, and then Alexader suggests that Alexander the Great was a homosexual who did not die in battle but at a later date. Stuff like that makes it hard for me to accept anything in this film. But the entertainment value here is enough to suggest watching it.

Easily the best film of the 1990's, it is also one of the most influential. Directed by Oliver Stone (NATURAL BORN KILLERS, U-TURN, ALEXANDER) and starring Kevin Costner (WATERWORLD, THE POSTMAN, OPEN RANGE) as Jim Garrison, the ONLY public offical to conduct his own investigation into the assassination of the 35th president of the United States, John Fitzgerald Kennedy. The film opens with a great scene full of stock footage narrarated by Martin Sheen (WALL STREET) setting up a feel for the 1960's, Kennedy's administration, his dealings with the Soviets, the Cuban missile crisis, the Bay Of Pigs invasion, and the C.I.A.. And then goes in to November 22, 1963 the day of Kennedy's assassination. We see the events taking place as we would have seen them on television that day. New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison watches too. Three years later the subject comes up again to Garrison and he discovers that accused assassin Lee Harvey Oswald, brilliantly played by Gary Oldman (BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA, SID & NANCY, THE DARK KNIGHT) spent the summer before the assassination right in Garrison's own backyard in New Orleans. Jim's investigation begins and takes him through a dark winding forest and right to the doorstep of the Central Intelligence Agency & the Military Industrial Complex. He then arrests a respected New Orleans buisness man and founder of the New Orlean's Trade Mart, Clay Shaw, played by Tommy Lee Jones (THE CLIENT, BATMAN FOREVER, NATURAL BORN KILLERS)for which he recieved an Academy Award nomination for ""Best Supporting Actor"". Garrison brings the only conspirator ever accused to trial for conspiring to murder JFK. The film is brilliant, engaging, thought provoking, stylish, expertly directed, wonderfully written, with top notch acting by an ensemble ALL STAR cast that also includes, Kevin Bacon(STIR OF ECHOES), Joe Pesci(CASINO), Sissy Spacek(CARRIE), Ed Asner(THE MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW), Jack Lemon(MY FELLOW AMERICANS), Walter Matthau(GRUMPY OLD MEN), John Candy(THE GREAT OUTDOORS), and Donald Sutherland(A TIME TO KILL). You have never seen a film like JFKand you aren't likely to ever see another. One of the best films I've ever seen and is a film that every American should see as well.It will entertain and disturb you.It's a film of epic proportions, of great intensity, and unbridled passion. An instant classic that ranks right up there with CITIZEN KANE, GONE WITH THE WIND, SCHILNDLER'S LIST and all the rest of them.

I have no love for Oliver Stone, and I feel he has a track reccord of playing fast and loose with  details to suit a political agenda. I sort of see him as the Howard Zinn of film making; that is not a compliment.However, with that as a caveat, I think it is also fair to assume that JFK was never intended to be 100 percent factually based. Rather, it was an effort ( and a darn successful one in my view ) to point out how many holes there are in the ""official"" narrative of what supposedly took place that horrible day in Dallas.Some people say that Walter Cronkite panned this film. So what? I could give a rats you-know-what about his opinion. In fact, if Cronkite didn't like it that tells me we may just be on to something here.So many questions left unanswered, but here is one issue that truly puzzles me: It is the height of the cold war, JFK is in hostile territory politically speaking (Texas) , and he is riding in an open top limo down streets lined with highrise buildings. Are you kidding me? What, did they WANT him to be shot? Some would say the answer is yes.I don't know what really happened that day any more than you do. I do, however, recall my dad saying right after the assasination,"" Why the hell did he (JFK) have the top (of the limo) down?"" My dad was a WWII vet with an eighth grade education. If HE was asking that question, you really have to wonder how JFK's security team could have screwed things up that badly by putting the president in such an obviously vulnerable position. Kennedy was a sitting duck, and it is very hard to believe  all the professional secret service and law enforcement people assigned to protect him didn't know that all too well.

This guy is a fantastic director (and writer) - imaginative, original, courageous and much more.  This movie will absolutely keep you riveted to your seat. In many ways, like Stone's ""The Doors"" (a five star effort), it will blow your mind.  Stone's creativity, compared to the crap spewing out of Hollywood these days, is truly remarkable.So, why two stars?  The allegations this movie makes (and don't be fooled by Stone's baloney that the movie gives multiple points of view - Stone's point of view, not subtly delivered, is that the U.S. government whacked Kennedy) are so absurd, when compared to the actual facts, as to be comical.  The completely unfunny part is that many in our illiterate society - particularly the young - will take this crap as real history.  The threads of coincidences, etc. which Stone, through nut-case Garrison's character (well played, as usual, by Costner), tries to morph into facts are so blatantly ridiculous (if you have taken any time at all to read about or study the Kennedy assassination) that your mind may be blown in this respect, also.To hear Stone tell it at the time of the movie's promotion, Kennedy was killed and the Warren commission illegally and under-handedly threw out the lone gunman as fact and no one in positions of responsibility ever challenged that conclusion (an assertion Dan Rather did a great job of exposing as false in an interview with Stone).  It would be easy, but probably boring, to point out all of the absurdities in this film - for they are legion.  So, my advice would be to 1) enjoy the flick, but give it no more credence as history than you would The Wizard of Oz; 2) if you are interested in the Kennedy Assassination, refer to the plethora of great books, documentaries, etc., which are available from all points of view; last, as with all things Oliver Stone, consider the source.

93304,ABLOQZIL42W7I,0790729733,"kone ""kone""","[22, 40]","Oliver Stone has created a film ""monster"" that forsakes the facts of the Kennedy assassination, and focuses on a pure imaginary conspiracy that is the ""brainchild"" of New Orlean's District Attorney Jim Garrison.  Wow, does Stone ever take liberty with the facts to present Garrison's deeply flawed and unproven theory!  Yet, because he is a good dramatic filmmaker, Stone makes this film very interesting and intriguing, and leaves the (uninformed and casual) viewer with the sense that a great travesty was inflicted on the American public with the death of JKF.  In essense, Garrison's theory was that Clay Shaw, a prominant businessman in New Orleans, arranged for the assassination of JFK and recruited a bunch of shady underworld characters to do the job for him, one of which was Lee H. Oswald.  Garrison's complex theory has Lyndon Johnson as the eventual source of the asassination, as Lyndon's motivation was to obtain the power of the presidency.  Of course, there is actually NO proof of anything in Garrison's theory, and in a court trial (which is the film's climax), the case against Clay Shaw is dropped for lack of evidence and he is declared innocent.Garrison got a lot of press out of his theory and antics, and he was a media darling appearing on late night talk shows giving the audience nothing but innuendos and half-truths.  Yet, the public was intrigued by a man such as Garrison who so confidently proclaimed he knew the REAL truth about the Kennedy assassination and would shortly break the news and case wide open.  Of course he never did.  What he did do was ruin Clay Shaw's business and life, and all because Garrision sought personal fame and the spotlight.  Garrison used Clay Shaw to elevate himself, destroying Shaw in the process.Kevin Costner is excellent as Jim Garrison, and because of Stone's script and Costner's performance, the viewer wants to believe that Garrison was a man who was after the truth and acted with honor and within the law.  Unfortunately for reality, the cold hard facts say otherwise.Stone sets back the Kennedy assassination light years with his untruthful account and his impact on viewers who have had little exposure to the real facts about the assassination.  This is why his book is a ""monster"", as Stone has set off his eager viewers down a path that leads nowhere.  If Stone wanted to do service to the Kennedy assassination, he could have least selected a conspiracy theory that had some basis in fact; in this case, Garrison's theory has been shown by several authors to be completely without truth or merit - a complete fabrication of Garrison's immagination.While the acting and story are worth a 5-star rating, the real truth about the assassination takes a beating and I cannot give this film a positive rating.  If you want to view the film as a pure effort in fiction, then it could perhaps be rated a 4-star movie, however, it's message is that Lyndon Johnson had Kennedy killed, and this is a charge that must be taken seriously and not lightly.  Therefore, I say avoid this film.  It will fill your mind with half-truths and conspiracies and will not point you to the truth.Jim ""Konedog"" Koenig",2,"""JFK"" is Oliver Stone's Distorted View of the Assassination",1124064000,"08 15, 2005",2005,3174,"['Oliver', 'Stone', 'created', 'film', 'monster', 'facts', 'Kennedy', 'assassination', 'pure', 'imaginary', 'conspiracy', 'brainchild', 'New', 'Orlean', 'District', 'Attorney', 'Jim', 'Garrison', 'Wow', 'Stone', 'ever', 'take', 'liberty', 'facts', 'present', 'Garrison', 'deeply', 'flawed', 'unproven', 'theory', 'Yet', 'good', 'dramatic', 'filmmaker', 'Stone', 'film', 'very', 'interesting', 'intriguing', 'uninformed', 'casual', 'viewer', 'sense', 'great', 'travesty', 'was', 'inflicted', 'American', 'public', 'death', 'JKF', 'essense', 'Garrison', 'theory', 'was', 'Clay', 'Shaw', 'prominant', 'businessman', 'New', 'Orleans', 'arranged', 'assassination', 'JFK', 'recruited', 'bunch', 'shady', 'underworld', 'characters', 'do', 'job', 'one', 'was', 'Lee', 'H.', 'Oswald', 'Garrison', 'complex', 'theory', 'Lyndon', 'Johnson', 'eventual', 'source', 'asassination', 'Lyndon', 'motivation', 'was', 'obtain', 'power', 'presidency', 'course', 'actually', 'NO', 'proof', 'anything', 'Garrison', 'theory', 'court', 'trial', 'film', 'climax', 'case', 'Clay', 'Shaw', 'dropped', 'lack', 'evidence', 'declared', 'innocent.Garrison', 'got', 'lot', 'press', 'theory', 'antics', 'was', 'media', 'darling', 'appearing', 'late', 'night', 'talk', 'giving', 'audience', 'nothing', 'innuendos', 'half-truths', 'public', 'was', 'intrigued', 'man', 'such', 'Garrison', 'who', 'so', 'confidently', 'proclaimed', 'knew', 'REAL', 'truth', 'Kennedy', 'assassination', 'would', 'shortly', 'break', 'news', 'case', 'wide', 'open', 'course', 'never', 'did', 'What', 'did', 'do', 'was', 'ruin', 'Clay', 'Shaw', 'business', 'life', 'Garrision', 'sought', 'personal', 'fame', 'spotlight', 'Garrison', 'used', 'Clay', 'Shaw', 'elevate', 'destroying', 'Shaw', 'process.Kevin', 'Costner', 'excellent', 'Jim', 'Garrison', 'Stone', 'script', 'Costner', 'performance', 'viewer', 'believe', 'Garrison', 'was', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'truth', 'acted', 'honor', 'law', 'Unfortunately', 'reality', 'cold', 'hard', 'facts', 'say', 'otherwise.Stone', 'sets', 'back', 'Kennedy', 'assassination', 'light', 'years', 'untruthful', 'account', 'impact', 'viewers', 'who', 'have', 'had', 'little', 'exposure', 'real', 'facts', 'assassination', 'why', 'book', 'monster', 'Stone', 'set', 'off', 'eager', 'viewers', 'down', 'path', 'nowhere', 'Stone', 'wanted', 'do', 'service', 'Kennedy', 'assassination', 'could', 'have', 'least', 'selected', 'conspiracy', 'theory', 'had', 'basis', 'fact', 'case', 'Garrison', 'theory', 'been', 'shown', 'several', 'authors', 'be', 'completely', 'truth', 'merit', 'complete', 'fabrication', 'Garrison', 'immagination.While', 'acting', 'story', 'are', '5-star', 'rating', 'real', 'truth', 'assassination', 'beating', 'can', 'not', 'give', 'film', 'positive', 'rating', 'want', 'view', 'film', 'pure', 'effort', 'fiction', 'then', 'could', 'perhaps', 'be', 'rated', '4-star', 'movie', 'however', 'message', 'Lyndon', 'Johnson', 'had', 'Kennedy', 'killed', 'charge', 'must', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'not', 'lightly', 'Therefore', 'say', 'film', 'will', 'fill', 'mind', 'half-truths', 'conspiracies', 'will', 'not', 'point', 'truth.Jim', 'Konedog', 'Koenig']",JFK Director's Cut

93315,A79U01AE98EV8,0790729733,MACLEAR,"[0, 5]","At one point Costner as Garrison argues that they are looking ""through the looking-glass.""  Indeed they are.  One half expects Garrison to point the dreaded finger at Twiddle Dee and Tweedle Dum.  or Srone, through a close reading as only he could perform it, claiming that ""The Walrus and The Carpenter"" is a veiled allusion to the CIA and Cubans (whether pro or anti Castro is hardly material) killing Kennedy (disguised here as oysters).The film's title alone is misleading as the film is emphatically not about Kennedy much less any achievements he may have had while president.  A more appropriate title would be ""Notes Towards A Supreme Fiction"" (with apologies to Wallace Stevens).  Oh yes, the film is highly stylized and expertly directed - it boasts an energy that is almost overwhelming.  That, alas, is the problem.  Some will be taken in by the style and not give a second thought to the ridiculousness of the plot (or lack of one).  Garrison was a brutal, ambitious blowhard who set about trying to make a name for himself by indicting those who he felt were corrupt citizens of New Orleans.  Even those who believe in a conspiracy find it difficult to take Mr. G's theories seriously.Even as fiction the plot is as unbelievable as ""The Hobbit"" is unbelievable - yet the latter at least makes no pretentions to being true.  Too, Tolkein's masterpiece touches us because the hobbits and their playmates have a nature not unlike our own.  Not so in Stone's polemic.  Has there ever been anyone as sanctimonious, as self-righteous as Costner's Garrison?  He fairly drips with the moral certitude usually found in psychotics.  Anyone who questions him is labeled ""naive"" or ""dangerous"".The picture the film paints of JFK as a lovable ""Mr. Smith"" who goes to Washington with nothing but the highest of ideals is not borne out by the facts.  Yes, but what do any facts have to do with the matter?  As the White Knight tells Alice, ""It is my own invention"".  Yes, and this is Stone's.  JFK was a cold warrior, not a pacifist who sent the military into Vietnam with every intention to bring them home a few days later.Does it even occur to Stone that fifty years after the terrible day in Dallas not ONE person has come forward claiming to have any information comcerning a conspiracy, that not one person has died leaving behind a will with any such information, that not one scrap of evidence has been unearthed that points to anyone being the shooter other than Oswald?, who, in this version of events, is a hapless idiot who would not hurt a fly, not because of any virtue inside of him, but simply because he'd need someone to show him how.  The gist is that the only one in Dallas or New Orleans (and perhaps a five hundred mile radius around them) that did not have anything to do with the assassination was Lee Harvey Oswald.This is serious ladies and gentlemen.  There are many whose perception of the events will be based solely on this film, people who cannot be bothered reading books on the subject, people easily swayed by the sleight of hand Stone is so expert at, people who believe that Shakespeare's plays were written by Ernest Hemingway, and that soy is a commie conspiracy. Oh wait, it isn't, is it?In his film ""Nixon"" Stone has a scene in which some oil bigshots try to convince Nixon to run for president in 64.  When he refuses by saying that Kennedy will no doubt win, the camera shifts to two airheaded prostitutes playing pool, one of whom raises her finger to her mouth as if to say ""Don't let's let Nixon know what we know"" which is presumably that Kennedy will not win as he will be shot.  Yes, even prostitutes were in on the game.

93316,A2ULSA0IRUE09E,0790729733,Marc Cabir Davis,"[68, 76]","Oliver Stone's &quot;JFK&quot; is a remarkable film that is too often overshadowed by the very real events upon which it is based and by the perceived political agenda of its director. But, as Stone himself has stated on numerous occasions, the movie is not meant to stand as a definitive historical document but rather as an alternative look at what might have happened on that fateful day in Dallas given the conflicting and incomplete information that came out of the official final word on President Kennedy's assassination, The Warren Commission Report. Much of &quot;JFK&quot; is based on known fact but Stone has taken it one step further and extrapolated out a variety of possible realities based on the many unanswered questions and perplexing coincidences that surround the case.The central character in the film is Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner), the district attorney from New Orleans who actually brought the case of the Kennedy assassination to court -- some three years after the fact. Although his attempt to convict Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones) of conspiracy in the assassination of the president was doomed to failure, the facts that he uncovered, and continued to pursue through his later writings on the subject, gave a certain legitimacy to the claims by conspiracy theorists that all was not right with the official investigation. Through countless scenes, the government's assertion that Lee Harvey Oswald (Gary Oldman) was in fact a lone gunman who acted of his own volition and with no outside help is continuously under siege. By the end of the film, every preconceived notion that the viewer may have had regarding the assassination has been called into question.In addition to the actors mentioned above, &quot;JFK&quot; is a virtual who's-who of Hollywood talent. Rounding out the cast are Kevin Bacon, Walter Matthau, Jack Lemmon, Donald Sutherland, Sissy Spacek, Joe Pesci, and even John Candy. In all instances, the performers bring a certain degree of mystery to their roles that really reinforces the overall disconcerting feel of the film.Enough about the film already, what about the DVD? Well, as many of you know, Warner first released &quot;JFK&quot; as a movie-only edition back in 1997. While this DVD featured Oliver Stone's preferred director's cut of the movie with some 17 additional minutes of footage reinserted, the video was non-anamorphic and the audio was a merely serviceable DD 2.0 mix. In addition, the lack of any extras was a shame and the disc itself was a dreaded &quot;flipper&quot;. With this new release, Warner has addressed all of these issues and &quot;JFK&quot; is at long last available in a fine special edition DVD.&quot;JFK&quot; is presented in anamorphic widescreen, preserving the 2.35:1 aspect ratio of the original theatrical release. Sharpness is usually quite solid although the extensive use of filters lends a somewhat soft appearance to the image in a number of scenes. Black levels and contrast are good with only the darkest of scenes losing fine shadow detail. Colors are accurate and exhibit no signs of bleeding but the palette is, for the most part, somewhat muted. I could spot no instances of compression artifacts and the edge enhancement that plagued the original release is mercifully gone. The video is a marked improvement over the old release and, while it isn't a perfect transfer, I could find no glaring issues with the work Warner has done preparing this release.Just as the video has been upgraded for the new special edition, so too has the audio. Replacing the fairly good Dolby Digital 2.0 mix on the previous release is a brand-new 5.1 channel Dolby Digital soundtrack available in both English and French. The increase in dynamic range afforded by this new mix really makes John Williams's moving score come alive and adds some overall depth to the soundtrack as a whole. Surround use is frequent and well-integrated and dialogue is always clear and firmly anchored to the center. While this new 5.1 mix certainly won't give the best soundtracks a run for their money, it is a fair improvement over the previous release and is very well done.Now we come to that facet of DVD that truly defines a special edition -- the extras. Seeing as how the film itself is quite long, Warner has taken the step of making &quot;JFK&quot; into a two-disc release in order to accommodate the plentiful bonus features.Disc One features the movie itself and provides a very engaging commentary track by Oliver Stone. I've listened to a number of his commentaries and they are always informative, entertaining, and full of great personal and professional recollections. &quot;JFK&quot; is no exception as the director delves into every facet of this remarkable film. His tone is always conversational which makes the three plus hours spent listening to him more enjoyable than one might expect. Rounding out the extras on Disc One are cast and crew bios and filmographies as well as a list of the awards that &quot;JFK&quot; has garnered.Disc Two is where the real strength of this special edition resides. First up is a 15 minute interview entitled &quot;Meet Mr. X: The Personality and Thoughts of Fletcher Prouty&quot; in which the real-life Mr. X discusses his particular take on the assassination. Played by Donald Sutherland in the movie, Mr. X was to Jim Garrison as Deep Throat was to Bob Woodward -- a shadowy source who provides the hints needed to further the investigation. Next up is &quot;Assassination Update: The New Documents,&quot; a 30 minute multimedia essay hosted by noted conspiracy theorist James DiEugenio. Combining text, photographs, and video clips, Mr. DiEugenio delivers a very riveting, if not a bit overwhelming and scattershot, look at the facts of the case that have come to light in recent years.Are we done yet? Not even close. Also included on Disc Two is 50 minutes of additional footage that can be viewed individually or as a complete set and with or without Oliver Stone's accompanying commentary. Combine this with the 17 minutes previously added back into the film and you have well over an hour of footage that wasn't in the original theatrical release. As is the case with some of the scenes that were added to the director's cut, much of this bonus material is redundant. Nevertheless, there are some real gems here and it's great that this abundance of cutting room casualties are included on the DVD.Rounding out the extras on Disc Two is the DVD-ROM content that features links to a number of websites, a series of theatrical trailers for this and other Oliver Stone films, print reviews of &quot;JFK,&quot; and a link for a future online chat with Oliver Stone. Whew!Now we turn to an aspect of this DVD that I rarely mention in a review -- the packaging. &quot;JFK&quot; is presented in Warner's preferred snapper case, which should come as no surprise. But, in order to accommodate the two discs, a pocket has been added to the cover flap and Disc Two resides there in a flimsy little envelope. It really is a screwy method that may be a bit rough on that second disc over the long haul so it's best that the buyer be forewarned. But, on the plus side, Warner has taken the negative comments about this packaging to heart and have promised to come up with a better alternative for any future two disc sets.&quot;JFK&quot; is a thought-provoking film that remains almost as big a conundrum as the subject upon which it is based. Many viewers and critics see it as nothing more than another political rant by that crazy Ollie Stone. Others have had their eyes opened wide upon seeing it and no longer view the world in quite the same rosy light as they once did. Skillfully filmed, well-acted, and at its very core quite unsettling, &quot;JFK&quot; stands as one of Oliver Stone's finest films.And what better way to treat a great film than with a brand new two disc special edition DVD? Featuring vastly improved video and audio, the new release presents &quot;JFK&quot; in fine fashion. The wealth of bonus features that examine the film itself, and the real-life events it revolves around, add some much needed depth to the understanding of this pivotal moment in American history. Throw in the fact that Warner is offering this two disc special edition for much less than some studios sell their bare-bones DVDs for and you have a sure-fire winner. The film and the DVD both come very highly recommended.",5,"A Remarkable Film, a remarkable DVD",1009324800,"12 26, 2001",2001,8439,"['Oliver', 'Stone', 'quot', 'JFK', 'quot', 'remarkable', 'film',

93317,A35PSVGX49GMA4,0790729733,margot,"[1, 1]","After 20+ years, this Oliver Stone tour-de-force holds up remarkably well. One reason is that we haven't been subjected to Kevin Costner overload in recent years, so he's halfway believable as Jim Garrison. Another reason is that the film was already retro-styled two decades in the past when it was being made, so we don't get 1990 continually punching us in the forehead (""Look at those cellphones! Look at those shoulder pads!""). Gary Oldman as Oswald is as stunning as ever. Joe Pesci is miscast as David Ferrie, but he fills the role with gusto. Tommy Lee Jones is hilarious as Clay Shaw.Oliver Stone took a lot of abuse from the Single Bullet cult when this film came out, but time has killed off the more notable culprits (eg Arlen Specter), and mellowed public opinion on the subject of the Grassy Knoll.

And public tolerance of the more 'verboten' shadings has broadened.

I mean where's the evidence?  None.  Stone made several good film before this, culminating in Born on the 4th of July, but years of paranoia due to drug abuse produce this ADD film.

Whether you want to believe it or not, 90% or more of the findings in the Warren Commission's report are irrefutable. Yes, there are many unanswered questions, and JFK the movie sheds little or almost no light on these. But, that does not take away from the stunning artistic value of this great motion picture.Stone treats the entire story, start to finish almost as a Hitchcock thriller. Sure we know where the story is heading and of course there is no surprise ending. So how does he keep us intrigued for two solid hours? How do we remain transfixed on the characters; Osewald, Ruby, Clay Shaw, Jim Garrison and others? Simplely put this project was flawlessly cast, expertly edited, well written and masterfully directed.Oliver Stone has made some great movies, The Doors, Wall Street, Platoon and Natural Born Killers to name a few.

First of all, I'd like to say that I know basically nothing about the actual details of the assination, so I can't say for sure how much of this movie is acurate to the historical fact.  However, I can say that it features a stunning preformance by Kevin Costner as investigator Jim Garrison and the movie pays much on the drama of the further investigation of the death of the president.  Overall, I thought that the movie opened America's eyes to the possibility of conspiracys surrounding the government.  The depiction of Oswald as being a &quot;patsy&quot; is one of the focal points of the film and it weaves a web of conspiracies involving Cuban guerrilla influences, Communism, and even questions about the American government's role in Kennedy's death.  The movie cultivates with the trial of Shaw.  The trial scene is where the intensity of the movie reaches its climax and although its depiction really does show how little of an actual case Garrison had on Shaw, it passionately attempts to unravel some of the mysteries involving the death of the president.  &quot;The magic bullet&quot; evidence really makes you believe that there has to have been at least some cover up of the details involving that famous day in Texas.  If anything, this movie brings the case into the spotlight, even if it will remain to be shadowed by some doubt.There are, however, some problems with the movie.  Other reviewers have stated that many facts have been juggled in order to create a believable story, and I'm sure that this is true.  It is unlikely that a number of the cut scences actually took place in their entiretity.  Also, some of the &quot;star studed actors&quot; that were featured in the film seemed to be playing roles that were not suited well for them.  Joe Pesci seemed miscast and John Candy's character was almost laughable in such a serious movie.  Finally, the movie is about three hours long and seems to drag in some places.  I haven't seem the un-cut version, but I can't really see why the extra material in the directors cut is really needed.  So many conspiracies are tossed around that after awhile, some of them to disprove each other.Overall, JFK may not be most perfect movie and probably did bend the facts a little, but it is worth seeing at least once.

93326,AN7JDZOXH1WC4,0790729733,"Matthew Easterbrook ""silverscreenjunkie""","[2, 3]","JFK is an amazing piece of cinematic propaganda second only to TRIUMPH DES WILLENS, Leni Riefenstahl's glorification of Nazi Germany, in its powers of persuasiveness.  In detailing New Orleans DA Jim Garrison's (Kevin Costner) case insinuating the involvement of prominent businessman Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones) in the murder of JFK, Stone paints several detailed scenarios of a conspiracy to murder the President.  These are so persuasive that even though he often goes a bit overboard on his ssumptions, you find yourself almost believing what he says.  I do believe there was a plot to murder Kennedy, although I wouldn't go so far as to implicate everyone in the world with the exception of Jackie O, as Stone does.At first Costner seems totally wrong for the part, but he grows on you, and turns in a decent performance.  The rest of the actors vanish beneath the facade of their characters, including Joe Pesci, John Candy, Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Donald Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, Sissy Spacek, and Gary Oldman as Lee Harvey Oswald.  Sutherland's scene in particular is brilliantly directed and edited, as Stone has you hanging on every single word.  Forget Judi Dench in SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE -- his is the best extended cameo appearance in the history of cinema.The technical staff did just as good a job.  Editors Pietro Scalia and Joe Hutshing blend actual documentary footage with film shot by cinematographer Robert Richardson, and do such a fine job that you can never tell which is which.  The music score by John Williams is great, as almost all Williams scores are.JFK is a film not to be missed.  Film buffs and students will admire it for its technical achievements, and the average moviegoer, regardless of whether they believe the magic bullet theory or not, will see this as top-notch entertainment.  Definitely one of the best movies of the 1990s.EXTRAS:  The commentary by Oliver Stone is informative, focusing on historical details more than the production itself.  He definitely comes off as an authority on the era, and acquits himself nicely.  The 1992 hour-and-a-half documentary on disc two, BEYOND JFK: THE QUESTION OF CONSPIRACY, is relatively informative, but don't watch it after watching the movie, unless you want to experience conspiracy theory overload (as well, much of it is repetitive, like it's defending the movie -- and considering it was made by the film's producers, it seems almost a tie-in).  There's almost an hour of deleted scenes, with optional commentary by Stone.  All of these are very interesting, and add much to the experience of Stone's vision (especially the scene in which Oswald speaks from the grave).

JFK became one of those films.I didn't see it until probably almost 15 years after it came out. I was scouring an auction site for old, cheap laser discs to add to my collection and came across it. It wasn't much, so I ordered it. It probably sat on my shelf for another year before I remembered that I owned it and finally popped it in. I hadn't been purposely hesitating, it's just that, you know, I had heard some not-good things about it and it wasn't a priority. I was pretty blown away by it and started recommending it to anyone who hadn't seen it. Yeah, it's not exactly rooted in reality, but as a crime procedural-thriller, it's a good flic! It's got solid performances from the entire cast, Stone was doing interesting things with lighting, cinematography, etc. and it's visually interesting. And, yeah, while Costner is completely tolerable his accent is both unnecessary and pretty bad. Garrison was originally from Iowa and didn't talk like that. Heck, the real Garrison is in the film (as Justice Warren) and he sounds like hes' from the middle of the country, not the south (you can also find videos of him on Youtube). Costner plays it like Garrison is from the Bayou-- but a cartoon Bayou. Other than that, though, he's good.I picked it up on Blu-Ray so that I wouldn't have to change discs to watch the last half (and the Mr. X monologue is one of my favorite parts). Yes, it's long spanning several years, but it's intriguing unless you can't switch off the part of your mind that just can't let this exist as entertainment instead of a documentary. It prompted me to spend a bit of time on line reading about some of the historical players in the film and reading some of the criticism of the film from a historical perspective. The film is fun for what it gets both right and wrong, what it represents and misrepresents, and as a supposition of what could happen and why. Also, the BD transfer is fantastic looking. Great color, the intentionally over-exposed bits are very bright, the shadows are dark, the warmly shot scenes are very nice looking. And the cast-- wow! There are enough stars and great actors in this film whose collective careers span the better part of the 20th century. And, hey, this film will give you plenty of ammo for your next Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon! You could probably get to Charlie Chaplin in just a couple jumps from here :)I say just enjoy it for what it is: a political crime procedural with some thriller elements.

The one fact that remains  is that when all is said and done, this is one heck of an ambitious and  (above all) endlessly intriguing masterpiece that has effectively  dramatized one of the most enduring passions of Americans for the past  forty years, and it stands as a towering triumph and call to arms for the  simple advocacy of something that our government (including the present,  past, and probably future administrations) consistently chooses to keep  from the citizens of this nation: T-R-U-T-H.

93329,A3JZ5L52FM318H,0790729733,"Matthew T. Weflen ""Matthew Weflen""","[3, 3]","The film:Plenty of ink has been spilled with regard to Oliver Stone's ""JFK."" I won't add much to a critical debate of it. I think it is enormously entertaining as a movie, is a valuable exercise in stirring up doubts and passions about a critical period in our history, and is a superb exercise in style - no other film better captures the ""through the looking glass"" feel that anyone who has researched this topic must feel. I watch this film every other year or so, and I never tire of revisiting the dense, compelling world Stone has created. This or that aspect of the film's thesis may be outdated or inaccurate, but that's not the point. The point is to stir up doubts, and plenty of the material Stone has presented in this drama still succeeds at that.The Blu-Ray:The video transfer is a faithful and restrained HD version of this film. It preserves quite well all of the wildly different film stocks that Stone employs. Black and white material is quite detailed and has a lovely grain structure. Color footage varies in lighting and filters depending on the year portrayed and the mood. So some material is quite hazy, while other material is relatively sharp. All of it is a good upgrade over previous DVD editions. The audio is a good Dolby TrueHD 5.1ch mix that presents dialogue and John Williams' wonderful score very well.Extras are where I have some problems with this disc. Several features from previous DVD editions (and there have been MANY) did not make it into this one, and the ones we have are of a generally low quality. The best of the bunch is 1 hour of cut and extended scenes. They are presented in 480p SD, with the option of a Stone commentary. Many are just extensions of existing scenes, however. A 90-minute film called ""Beyond JFK The Question of Conspiracy"" is a making-of with critical review and interviews of experts. It admirably tries to present all sides, but the production values are terrible. A new 30-minute doc about declassified documents post 1992 is kind of meandering and tough to follow. Unfortunately it ends up sounding like a conspiracy nut (it is narrated by the editor of a conspiracy magazine) happily confirming his own previously held opinions. Finally, we have an 11-minute shot on video interview with Fletcher ""Mr. X"" Prouty. A/V quality is terrible and for the most part nothing terribly interesting is said. In the end, as far as extras go, there have been much better productions by various outlets (BBC, History Channel, CBS, PBS) that you would do much better to watch than these extras. The best extra on this disc is Stone's commentary.The packaging is a ""digibook,"" a nice idea that doean't really deliver. We get some pap about the movie's critical reception, and some biography pages of the director and actors. Which is to say, nothing that isn't better done than it is on the Internet. We also do NOT get a list of materials on the Blu-Ray. Kind of irritating, if you ask me.***********This is a must-own for Oliver Stone fans. It's one of his best films, easily. It is taut (quite a thing to say about a 3.5 hour film), moving, thrilling, and provocative. It caused a huge stir upon its release and had a real effect on the government, inspiring Congress to act to release documents. It's definitely one of the most important films of the 1990s, and any cinema fan should own it.It's not a perfect edition. The Video is good but not great, owing to the stylistic choices of Stone himself. It's way better than the DVD, though, and may be the best it can look on Blu-Ray. What is not better than some previous DVDs are the extras in this edition. So buy this edition for the film itself, not for the supplements.One final note: there are two anniversaries coming up - 2011 marks the 20th anniversary of the film itself. 2013 marks the 50th anniversary of the assassination. Take it for what you will, but I'd bet dollars to doughnuts that there will be a new edition of this movie on Blu-Ray during one of those years. This edition will probably have an entire extra disc of extras filmed in HD and produced at a much higher level. The film itself may also look better, given inevitable advances in film transfer technology and the learning curve of a new format (think of how DVD looks now vs. in 1997...). So ""caveat emptor"" for the inevitable double dip (or is it sextuple dip at this point?).",4,"A great film, an interesting if flawed theory, a so-so Blu-Ray",1244419200,"06 8, 2009",2009,4372,"['film', 'Plenty', 'ink', 'been', 'spilled', 'regard', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'JFK', 'wo', ""n't"", 'add', 'much', 'critical', 'debate', 'think', 'enormously', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'valuable', 'exercise', 'stirring', 'up', 'doubts', 'passions', 'critical', 'period', 'history', 'superb', 'exercise', 'style', 'other', 'film', 'better', 'looking', 'glass', 'feel', 'anyone', 'who', 'researched', 'topic', 'must', 'feel', 'watch', 'film', 'other', 'year', 'so', 'never', 'tire', 'revisiting', 'dense', 'compelling', 'world', 'Stone', 'created', 'aspect', 'film', 'thesis', 'may', 'be', 'outdated', 'inaccurate', 'not', 'point', 'point', 'stir', 'up', 'doubts', 'plenty', 'material', 'Stone', 'presented', 'drama', 'still', 'that.The', 'Blu-Ray', 'video', 'transfer', 'faithful', 'restrained', 'HD', 'version', 'film', 'quite', 'well', 'wildly', 'different', 'film', 'stocks', 'Stone', 'Black', 'white', 'material', 'quite', 'detailed', 'lovely', 'grain', 'structure', 'Color', 'footage', 'varies', 'lighting', 'filters', 'depending', 'year', 'portrayed', 'mood', 'material', 'quite', 'hazy', 'other', 'material', 'relatively', 'sharp', 'good', 'upgrade', 'previous', 'DVD', 'editions', 'audio', 'good', 'Dolby', 'TrueHD', '5.1ch', 'mix', 'dialogue', 'John', 'Williams', 'wonderful', 'score', 'very', 'well.Extras', 'are', 'where', 'have', 'problems', 'disc', 'Several', 'features', 'previous', 'DVD', 'editions', 'there', 'have', 'been', 'MANY', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'one', 'ones', 'have', 'are', 'generally', 'low', 'quality', 'best', 'bunch', '1', 'hour', 'cut', 'extended', 'scenes', 'are', 'presented', '480p', 'SD', 'option', 'Stone', 'commentary', 'Many', 'are', 'just', 'extensions', 'existing', 'scenes', 'however', '90-minute', 'film', 'called', 'Beyond', 'JFK', 'Question', 'Conspiracy', 'making-of', 'critical', 'review', 'interviews', 'experts', 'admirably', 'present', 'sides', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'terrible', 'new', '30-minute', 'doc', 'declassified', 'documents', 'post', '1992', 'kind', 'meandering', 'tough', 'follow', 'Unfortunately', 'up', 'sounding', 'conspiracy', 'nut', 'narrated', 'editor', 'conspiracy', 'magazine', 'happily', 'confirming', 'own', 'previously', 'held', 'opinions', 'Finally', 'have', '11-minute', 'shot', 'video', 'interview', 'Fletcher', 'Mr.', 'X', 'Prouty', 'A/V', 'quality', 'terrible', 'most', 'part', 'nothing', 'terribly', 'interesting', 'said', 'end', 'as', 'far', 'extras', 'go', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'productions', 'various', 'outlets', 'BBC', 'History', 'Channel', 'CBS', 'PBS', 'would', 'do', 'much', 'better', 'watch', 'extras', 'best', 'extra', 'disc', 'Stone', 'commentary.The', 'packaging', 'digibook', 'nice', 'idea', 'doea', ""n't"", 'really', 'deliver', 'get', 'pap', 'movie', 'critical', 'reception', 'biography', 'pages', 'director', 'actors', 'Which', 'say', 'nothing', ""n't"", 'better', 'done', 'Internet', 'also', 'do', 'NOT', 'get', 'list', 'materials', 'Blu-Ray', 'Kind', 'irritating', 'ask', '***********This', 'must-own', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'fans', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'easily', 'taut', 'quite', 'thing', 'say', '3.5', 'hour', 'film', 'moving', 'thrilling', 'provocative', 'caused', 'huge', 'stir', 'release', 'had', 'real', 'effect', 'government', 'inspiring', 'Congress', 'act', 'release', 'documents', 'definitely', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'films', '1990s', 'cinema', 'fan', 'should', 'own', 'it.It', 'not', 'perfect', 'edition', 'Video', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'owing', 'stylistic', 'choices', 'Stone', 'way', 'better', 'DVD', 'though', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'can', 'look', 'Blu-Ray', 'What', 'not', 'better', 'previous', 'DVDs', 'are', 'extras', 'edition', 'So', 'buy', 'edition', 'film', 'not', 'supplements.One', 'final', 'note', 'are', 'two', 'anniversaries', 'coming', 'up', '2011', '20th', 'anniversary', 'film', '2013', '50th', 'anniversary', 'assassination', 'Take', 'what', 'will', ""'d"", 'bet', 'dollars', 'doughnuts', 'will', 'be', 'new', 'edition', 'movie', 'Blu-Ray', 'one', 'years', 'edition', 'will', 'probably', 'have', 'entire', 'extra', 'disc', 'extras', 'filmed', 'HD', 'produced', 'much', 'higher', 'level', 'film', 'may', 'also', 'look', 'better', 'given', 'inevitable', 'advances', 'film', 'transfer', 'technology', 'learning', 'curve', 'new', 'format', 'think', 'how', 'DVD', 'now', 'vs.', '1997', 'caveat', 'emptor', 'inevitable', 'double', 'dip', 'sextuple', 'dip', 'point']",JFK Director's Cut

93332,AC9VA2KAQLSX4,0790729733,Metaldiva,"[3, 5]","This is a modern masterpiece in film.  Not for the special effects or anything of the sort, but for the brilliant blend of who-dun-it, fact, the combination of old and new footage and the well moving script.  The honest dialog and the excellent performances of all the actors makes this thought provoking film one you will want to watch over and over again. (each time you will notice something new)The main story surrounds the efforts of New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison,to bring the perpetrators and collaborators of the assassination of JFK to justice.  It covers the little publicized ""New Orleans"" connections to that fateful day and gives insight into the cold war, anti-communist fervor of the day.  Oliver Stone has never publicly declared that this plot was ""the"" theory but rather bits and pieces of of a puzzle that does make sense when you place them side by side.  This is an enigma that will probably never be completely solved, due in part to the fact that witnesses are dying off and there is a welcomed want in the American psyche to just let painful things be.The storyline is a combination of several books written about different theories (not solely Garrison's) which covers a great deal of fascinating possibilities and it is a powerful, emotional script. The stellar cast brings great credibility to the project as a whole. Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Ed Asner, Joe Pesci, John Candy, Donald Sutherland, Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Bacon, Gary Oldman and Sissy Spacek, to name a few, grace the film with striking, sensitive and realistic performances. Pesci, who plays David Ferrie, is at his spastic best. Gary Oldman is quirky and unsettling as Lee Harvey Oswald. But besides Kevin Costner, who plays Garrison himself, the most noticeable roles are Sutherland as ""X"" and Jones as Clay Shaw.  Sutherlands fast moving, fact filled recollection of the days leading up to, day of and days after Dallas is rivetingly filled with one little known fact after another. Jones' portrayal of the slickly, southern gentlemanly, secretly homosexual Shaw is eerie and thought provoking.  Garrison's final summation, delivered by Costner, is emotionally gripping and its single shot editing, makes it more dramatic-almost mesmerizing.Like Pearl Harbor, and most recently World Trade Center, my parents and their friends all remember where they were when they heard about the tragedy in Dallas.

93333,A1TJPMB7N776WS,0790729733,MICHAEL ACUNA,"[1, 3]","The beauty of Oliver Stone's ""JFK"" is that it has and will for a long time still, engender a mass of hate, love, incomprehension and good old America debate.Just this last week, being the 40th Anniversary of the assassination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy, there were two documentaries televised: one supported the claim of the lone gunman theory and the findings of the Warren Commission while the other supported the two+ gunman conspiracy theory with all the attendant evidence in support. Is there any wonder that we as a Nation have no idea what/who/why happened on November 22, 1963 in Dallas? Stone's ""JFK"" seems heavily dependent on the second 7 hour BBC produced documentary (ridiculous in that it is better researched that the Warren Commission!) for many of it's facts, though the BBC program looked at Jim Garrison's contribution to the investigation as a sidelight not the main event.Be all of that as it may, this film is a lollapalooza: a fascinating, dramatic, though obviously slanted look at what was the most important and riveting event in American history until 9/11. And Stone does a tremendously effective job of marshalling all of the facts, fiction and theories into a dramatic whole. This is not a documentary, this is a film based on fact.  And since the only fact we all can all agree on is that someone shot JFK in Dallas on 11/22/63, it seems to me that everything else is open to speculation and interpretation.Kevin Costner gives a bravura performance as Jim Garrison: a man so conflicted and so troubled by the assassination that he feels compelled to bring someone to trial for it. His summation scene, which goes on for nearly 45 minutes towards the end of ""JFK"" is so moving, so strongly felt, so incisively acted, so emotionally aware that we actually see Costner underneath the performance as Garrison: the third wall is removed and it is Costner not only speaking to us, he is speaking for us.We will never know exactly what happened in Dallas on that Friday afternoon 40 years ago, but we do have this film and Costner's performance as a reminder of what can happen when someone of intelligence and foresight tackles a problem and proposes a hypothesis: right or wrong is not the issue, making the effort is.",5,It's Stone's Throw,1069632000,"11 24, 2003",2003,2245,"['beauty', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'JFK', 'will', 'long', 'time', 'still', 'engender', 'mass', 'hate', 'love', 'incomprehension', 'good', 'old', 'America', 'debate.Just', 'last', 'week', 'being', '40th', 'Anniversary', 'assassination', 'John', 'Fitzgerald', 'Kennedy', 'were', 'two', 'documentaries', 'televised', 'one', 'supported', 'claim', 'lone', 'gunman', 'theory', 'findings', 'Warren', 'Commission', 'other', 'supported', 'two+', 'gunman', 'conspiracy', 'theory', 'attendant', 'evidence', 'support', 'there', 'wonder', 'Nation', 'have', 'idea', 'what/who/why', 'happened', 'November', '22', '1963', 'Dallas', 'Stone', 'JFK', 'heavily', 'dependent', 'second', '7', 'hour', 'BBC', 'produced', 'documentary', 'ridiculous', 'better', 'researched', 'Warren', 'Commission', 'many', 'facts', 'BBC', 'program', 'looked', 'Jim', 'Garrison', 'contribution', 'investigation', 'sidelight', 'not', 'main', 'event.Be', 'may', 'film', 'lollapalooza', 'fascinating', 'dramatic', 'though', 'obviously', 'slanted', 'look', 'what', 'was', 'most', 'important', 'riveting', 'event', 'American', 'history', '9/11', 'Stone', 'tremendously', 'effective', 'job', 'marshalling', 'facts', 'fiction', 'theories', 'dramatic', 'whole', 'not', 'documentary', 'film', 'based', 'fact', 'only', 'fact', 'can', 'agree', 'someone', 'shot', 'JFK', 'Dallas', '11/22/63', 'everything', 'else', 'open', 'speculation', 'interpretation.Kevin', 'Costner', 'bravura', 'performance', 'Jim', 'Garrison', 'man', 'so', 'conflicted', 'so', 'troubled', 'assassination', 'compelled', 'bring', 'someone', 'trial', 'summation', 'scene', 'nearly', '45', 'minutes', 'end', 'JFK', 'so', 'moving', 'so', 'strongly', 'felt', 'incisively', 'acted', 'so', 'emotionally', 'aware', 'actually', 'see', 'Costner', 'performance', 'Garrison', 'third', 'wall', 'removed', 'Costner', 'not', 'only', 'speaking', 'speaking', 'us.We', 'will', 'never', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'happened', 'Dallas', 'Friday', 'afternoon', '40', 'years', 'ago', 'do', 'have', 'film', 'Costner', 'performance', 'reminder', 'what', 'can', 'happen', 'when', 'someone', 'intelligence', 'foresight', 'tackles', 'problem', 'hypothesis', 'right', 'wrong', 'not', 'issue', 'making', 'effort']",JFK Director's Cut

93335,A2ZLROGIL2V7GV,0790729733,Michael Crane,"[216, 238]","Oliver Stone's ""JFK"" is a monstrous epic that revolves around the whole mystery around President Kennedy's assassination.  While it is a dramatic picture and Stone most likely twisted a few things to make this a more relevant and better movie, it is still an undeniable powerhouse that has you go through a whole set of emotions, ranging from fear, anger, paranoia and sadness.  There's no question that the majority of the country believes that there is more to the assassination than we were lead to believe.  I don't think it's exactly how it is in the movie, but that's not important.  What is important is that the film works for many reasons.President Kennedy has been assassinated.  Lee Harvey Oswald is the suspect and gets shot shortly after.  There is a secretive and brief hearing on the whole assassination, and it is in stone that Oswald was a lone gunman and nobody else was involved.  Seems like an open-and-shut-case, but District Attorney Jim Garrison isn't willing to buy it.  With his staff, they decide to work on the case, until they are shut down by the government.  Three years later, Garrison isn't willing to stand by in silence anymore and decides to go ahead with the case.  The further he digs, the more horrible truths he uncovers.  Not only that, but people high up in the ranks are willing to do anything to make sure that the American Public will never find out about them.As I said, this isn't meant to be an entirely accurate portrayal of how everything happened.  It suggests to you that it could've been this way, and it even does a good job of presenting its case to you.  What I think Stone was trying to achieve was to create his own commentary on how people feel about the handling of the whole assassination and how sloppily the case was handled.  The film wasn't made to merely exploit the death of Kennedy, but what it does exploit is the fact that we're willing to believe anything they tell us in the media.  It's a hard concept to grasp, because it's not too far from the truth.  The movie is brilliantly directed and well-acted.  Kevin Costner gives one of the best performances of his career.  The film has a whole list of famous actors in it, like Gary Oldman, Kevin Bacon, Tommy Lee Jones, Joe Pesci, Sissy Spacek and a whole bunch more.  They are all fantastic in their roles.A word of warning; this is a VERY LONG movie.  It is about 3 and a half hours long in running time.  If you want to watch this, then you have to really commit to it.  If you're not in the mood for a very lengthy movie, then you will not be able to enjoy this.  The new 2-Disc Special Edition offers a remastered director's cut that looks and sounds great.  Another interesting feature is the documentary, ""Beyond JFK: The Question of Conspiracy.""  Extras included are deleted/extended scenes, commentary from the director, theatrical trailer, essays and DVD-ROM features.  A very nice package that does the film justice.JFK"" is an amazing picture that did not bore me for a single second.  Not only does it work as a powerful drama, but it also works as an intense thriller.  Did everything happen the way the movie proposes?  Maybe, maybe not.  What the film does is make you think about everything that happened around the assassination.  Any film that can get the brain thinking is more than okay in my book.

93337,AL4MKKO24563R,0790729733,Michael K. Beusch,"[25, 26]","Oliver Stone, to say the least, is one of the most controversial directors in film history. Many see him as a dangerous loose cannon who rewrites history to fit his own agenda. I see him as a filmmaker who has the guts to speak his mind on controversial subjects -- even when his point of view flies in the face of ""conventional"" wisdom.Nowhere is this more true than in JFK. Despite the fact that a large majority of Americans believe that President Kennedy was assassinated as the result of a conspiracy, the media lambasted Stone for his interpretation of the events of November 22, 1963. Various journalists and columnists called Stone everything from a revisionist historian to a crackpot when the film was released. To be sure, New Oreleans Disctrict Attorney Jim Garrison wasn't the knight on a white horse of Stone's film -- his investigative tactics were very shady. Garrison mysteriously did not investigate possible mob connections to the assassination. And Stone does implicate almost everyone, including Presidents Johnson and Nixon, J. Edgar Hoover and almost the entire Dallas Police Department.However, Garrison is merely a catalyst for Stone's thesis as the only person who ever indicted a suspect (Clay Shaw) in the murder of John F. Kennedy. And even with its myriad of conspriacy theories, the sad fact remains that Stone's interpretation is much closer to the truth than the Warren Commission Report. We can, for example, see on the Zapruder film that JFK is suddenly and violently slammed backwards and to the left by the shot to his head, indicating a firing position from the front and not from the Texas School Book Depository where Lee Harvey Oswald was. Most Americans don't believe that Oswald, who, at the height of the Cold War, defected to Russia with the intention of passing on U.S. Government secrets, married a Colonel's daughter, then somehow regained his U.S. citizenship and returned to the U.S., was just the ""lone nut"" the Warren Commission claimed he was. And most Americans don't believe that Jack Ruby killed Oswald merely to ""spare Jackie Kennedy the trauma of having to return to Dallas for Oswald's trial."" In spite of this, however, the media jumped all over Stone's film, lambasting him as loose with the facts and irresponsible.Stone does in JFK what the Constitution gives Americans the right to do -- namely question authority when the answers it gives us do not satisfy and enlighten. I don't think that the media was part of the plot. But the media does act as a unwitting aid to the conspirators when they whitewash the work of an Oliver Stone as the work of a crackpot. Perhaps the media collectively does not have the courage to risk its reputation or maybe they are frustrated and angry that they didn't dig deeper at the time of the assassination. Whatever the reason, they do no service to either the people of the United States or the truth when they issue their blanket dismissals of JFK and other films like it. I agree that Stone should be held accountable for any inaccuracies in his films. However, the press should be held just as accountable when they back the utterly useless Warren Commission version of the Kennedy assassination. Gerald Posner can shout ""CASE CLOSED"" all he wants from the highest mountain top, but the questions and the doubts remain.Last June I visited Dallas, Dealey Plaza and the Texas School Book Depository. To say it was an eerie experience was an understatement. Most of the museum on the sixth floor (where Oswald allegedly fired from) was dedicated exclusively to the assassination. However a large portion of the museum was dedicated to President Kennedy's life and administration. Almost as heartbreaking as the memories of his assassination and funeral were the reminders of all the hope and potential that was snuffed out on November 22, 1963. JFK brings back the pain and anguish of not only the assassination, but America in the years after John F. Kennedy's assassination.

93341,A2JCYG8N1L8ZN2,0790729733,Mickey,"[2, 14]","I realize this movie was made in 1991, before a lot of research had pretty solidly confirmed the Warren Commission's findings, but that doesn't excuse the dishonesty presented in this fictionalized 'documentary'. When the president and the governor are placed in their 'properly assigned seats' (Kennedy seated to the right a few inches of the governor and leaning out the window, the governor sitting on a 'jump seat' a few inches higher than Kennedy) the need for a magic bullet disappears. There have been at least 2 moving car recreations (with real live dummies pretty closely resembling not only the size, but also the inside bodies of Kennedy and the governor.) In one of these recreations, the bullet wounds on the dummies match exactly the wounds on the actual bodies, minus the wound to the governor's thigh. (The bullet hit an extra 'rib' inside the dummy, and therefore didn't have enough momentum to injure the dummy's leg.Some other less than honest claims...that Oswald was a poor shot. Not true. That Oswald couldn't get 3 shots off in 9 seconds. (A few marksmen were able to get off 3 shots, hitting the intended targets, in just under 9 seconds.) That he couldn't make it down 4 flights of stairs in 90 seconds without being winded. (A man of similar size and fitness was able to do it in 48 seconds without being winded.) That he couldn't make it to the point where he had the confrontation with the cop in under 15 minutes. (In another test, the same man was able to get to the destination in about 11 minutes.)There have been a handful of documentaries shown on the Discovery Channel, History Channel, etc. Each of the above points, as well as many others, are demonstrated fairly clearly...Unsolved History: JFK Beyond the Magic Bullet; Kennedy Assassination: Beyond Conspiracy; JFK: Case Not Closed; and Investigating History: JFK Assassination each dispel the mistruths demonstrated in the JFK movie. (all available on Amazon)Bottom line, it's ok to have doubts about Oswald being the lone gunman, but the only hard evidence in this case all points to Oswald.As far as the movie itself goes, I guess it was ok. The one scene that always stuck in my mind was the one with Joe Pesci getting choked by someone. In one frame, he has his hairpiece looking ok. As the choking continues, it flashes back between the hairpiece being halfway down his face, and then being back on right again. It looks something from a bad spoof movie. Or are we to believe that the guy choking him is also moving his hairpiece back and forth?",2,Really bad history,1265328000,"02 5, 2010",2010,2541,"['realize', 'movie', 'was', 'made', '1991', 'lot', 'research', 'had', 'pretty', 'solidly', 'confirmed', 'Warren', 'Commission', 'findings', ""n't"", 'excuse', 'dishonesty', 'presented', 'fictionalized', ""'documentary"", 'When', 'president', 'governor', 'are', 'placed', ""'properly"", 'assigned', 'seats', 'Kennedy', 'seated', 'right', 'few', 'inches', 'governor', 'leaning', 'out', 'window', 'governor', 'sitting', ""'jump"", 'seat', 'few', 'inches', 'higher', 'Kennedy', 'need', 'magic', 'bullet', 'disappears', 'have', 'been', 'least', '2', 'moving', 'car', 'recreations', 'real', 'live', 'dummies', 'pretty', 'closely', 'resembling', 'not', 'only', 'size', 'also', 'inside', 'bodies', 'Kennedy', 'governor', 'one', 'recreations', 'bullet', 'dummies', 'match', 'exactly', 'wounds', 'actual', 'bodies', 'wound', 'governor', 'thigh', 'bullet', 'hit', 'extra', ""'rib"", 'dummy', 'therefore', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'momentum', 'injure', 'dummy', 'leg.Some', 'other', 'less', 'honest', 'claims', 'Oswald', 'was', 'poor', 'shot', 'Not', 'true', 'Oswald', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', '3', 'shots', '9', 'seconds', 'few', 'marksmen', 'were', 'able', 'get', 'off', '3', 'shots', 'hitting', 'intended', 'targets', 'just', '9', 'seconds', 'could', ""n't"", 'make', 'down', '4', 'flights', 'stairs', '90', 'seconds', 'being', 'winded', 'man', 'similar', 'size', 'fitness', 'was', 'able', 'do', '48', 'seconds', 'being', 'winded', 'could', ""n't"", 'make', 'point', 'where', 'had', 'confrontation', 'cop', '15', 'minutes', 'test', 'same', 'man', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'destination', '11', 'minutes', 'have', 'been', 'handful', 'documentaries', 'shown', 'Discovery', 'Channel', 'History', 'Channel', 'etc', 'above', 'points', 'as', 'well', 'many', 'others', 'are', 'demonstrated', 'fairly', 'clearly', 'Unsolved', 'History', 'JFK', 'Beyond', 'Magic', 'Bullet', 'Kennedy', 'Assassination', 'Beyond', 'Conspiracy', 'JFK', 'Case', 'Not', 'Closed', 'Investigating', 'History', 'JFK', 'Assassination', 'dispel', 'mistruths', 'demonstrated', 'JFK', 'movie', 'available', 'Amazon', 'Bottom', 'line', 'ok', 'have', 'doubts', 'Oswald', 'being', 'lone', 'gunman', 'only', 'hard', 'evidence', 'case', 'points', 'Oswald.As', 'far', 'movie', 'guess', 'was', 'ok', 'one', 'scene', 'always', 'stuck', 'mind', 'was', 'one', 'Joe', 'Pesci', 'getting', 'choked', 'someone', 'one', 'frame', 'hairpiece', 'looking', 'choking', 'back', 'hairpiece', 'being', 'down', 'face', 'then', 'being', 'back', 'right', 'again', 'something', 'bad', 'spoof', 'movie', 'are', 'believe', 'guy', 'choking', 'also', 'moving', 'hairpiece', 'back', 'forth']",JFK Director's Cut

93343,A1D1MIFRSG50Y3,0790729733,Mike S.,"[1, 1]","This is a film that sparked a lot of controversy, even before it was released. The topic of the film has been (and will likely continue to be) one of the most controversial topics in American history. Unfortunately, the lines of who will like and dislike this movie will fall squarely within whether that person believes there was a conspiracy to kill Kennedy or not. I honestly think regardless of where you stand on that subject, this movie is entertaining and worth watching.Stone definitely believes there was a conspiracy, even while acknowledging in the notes included in the book portion of the director's cut of the film that it is possible there was none. Where he opened himself up to criticism is that he did not pick a theory and go with that. While the movie is centered around the alleged involvement of Clay Shaw, Stone basically threw out all the various possibilities that have been put forth over the years from Cuba to the mob, to the CIA orchestrating the hit. He couches the various theories using words like possibly, maybe etc. He also does a great job weaving in old news and archived footage with scenes that he filmed.  So much so that it was hard to tell at times where the footage ended and the movie started. Stone's stated intention however was to provide all of the theories, and let the viewers make up their own minds. To that end, regardless of whether you believe that was the responsible way to approach the film, it succeeds. Where he did leave himself open to the most valid criticism was where he was just plain inaccurate. The big one that comes to mind is the trial scene recreating the magic bullet when he placed Kennedy and Connely directly in line with each other on the same level. In reality Connely's seat sat lower and off center, which when taken into account omits all the turns that the bullet would have to do in the whole ""left, then right"" sequence of the film.The lynchpin of the film's quality, regardless of whether you agree with the substance, was the acting. Many A or B list actors who were alive at the time had a role in the film. Some little more than cameos, but it really was a who's who when it came to the cast. I think Costner did a great job making Jim Garrison much more of a heroic figure than he really was. His overall reputation outside the JFK case was pretty checkered. The film boasts a cast of Donald Sutherland, Sissy Spacek, Walter Mathau, John Candy, Tommy Lee Jones, Gary Oldman and Kevin Bacon, among many others. There was not one bad performance in the bunch.I am not sure how long the theatrical version of the movie is. If memory serves, it was just under three hours. This clocks in at just under three and a half hours, with a lot of additional and extended scenes. Including a 5 minute or so narrative at the beginning of the movie that describes Kennedy's presidency up to that point. There are also a few features included as extras along with even more deleted scenes. Chances are anyone reading this by now already has a strong opinion of the movie. For those who do not, as I said regardless of your position on whether there was a conspiracy or not, you can still enjoy the acting and the non fictionalized or theorized historical aspects of the movie. If nothing else this will always be a movie that is a conversation starter.",5,"A great, and controversial movie",1372982400,"07 5, 2013",2013,3326,"['film', 'sparked', 'lot', 'controversy', 'even', 'was', 'released', 'topic', 'film', 'been', 'will', 'likely', 'continue', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'controversial', 'topics', 'American', 'history', 'Unfortunately', 'lines', 'who', 'will', 'like', 'dislike', 'movie', 'will', 'fall', 'squarely', 'person', 'was', 'conspiracy', 'kill', 'Kennedy', 'not', 'honestly', 'think', 'regardless', 'where', 'stand', 'subject', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'worth', 'watching.Stone', 'definitely', 'was', 'conspiracy', 'even', 'acknowledging', 'notes', 'included', 'book', 'portion', 'director', 'cut', 'film', 'possible', 'was', 'none', 'Where', 'opened', 'criticism', 'did', 'not', 'pick', 'theory', 'go', 'movie', 'centered', 'alleged', 'involvement', 'Clay', 'Shaw', 'Stone', 'basically', 'threw', 'out', 'various', 'possibilities', 'have', 'been', 'put', 'forth', 'years', 'Cuba', 'mob', 'CIA', 'orchestrating', 'hit', 'various', 'theories', 'using', 'words', 'possibly', 'maybe', 'etc', 'also', 'great', 'job', 'weaving', 'old', 'news', 'archived', 'footage', 'scenes', 'filmed', 'So', 'much', 'was', 'hard', 'tell', 'times', 'where', 'footage', 'ended', 'movie', 'started', 'Stone', 'stated', 'intention', 'however', 'was', 'provide', 'theories', 'let', 'viewers', 'make', 'up', 'own', 'minds', 'end', 'regardless', 'believe', 'was', 'responsible', 'way', 'approach', 'film', 'Where', 'did', 'leave', 'open', 'most', 'valid', 'criticism', 'was', 'where', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'inaccurate', 'big', 'one', 'mind', 'trial', 'scene', 'recreating', 'magic', 'bullet', 'when', 'placed', 'Kennedy', 'Connely', 'directly', 'line', 'other', 'same', 'level', 'reality', 'Connely', 'seat', 'sat', 'lower', 'center', 'when', 'taken', 'account', 'turns', 'bullet', 'would', 'have', 'do', 'whole', 'left', 'then', 'right', 'sequence', 'film.The', 'lynchpin', 'film', 'quality', 'regardless', 'agree', 'substance', 'was', 'acting', 'B', 'list', 'actors', 'who', 'were', 'alive', 'time', 'had', 'role', 'film', 'little', 'more', 'cameos', 'really', 'was', 'who', 'who', 'when', 'came', 'cast', 'think', 'Costner', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'making', 'Jim', 'Garrison', 'much', 'more', 'heroic', 'figure', 'really', 'was', 'overall', 'reputation', 'JFK', 'case', 'was', 'pretty', 'checkered', 'film', 'cast', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'Walter', 'Mathau', 'John', 'Candy', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'many', 'others', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'bad', 'performance', 'bunch.I', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'long', 'theatrical', 'version', 'movie', 'memory', 'serves', 'was', 'just', 'three', 'hours', 'just', 'three', 'half', 'hours', 'lot', 'additional', 'extended', 'scenes', 'Including', '5', 'minute', 'so', 'narrative', 'beginning', 'movie', 'Kennedy', 'presidency', 'up', 'point', 'are', 'also', 'few', 'features', 'included', 'extras', 'even', 'more', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Chances', 'are', 'anyone', 'reading', 'now', 'already', 'strong', 'opinion', 'movie', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'said', 'regardless', 'position', 'was', 'conspiracy', 'not', 'can', 'still', 'enjoy', 'acting', 'non', 'fictionalized', 'theorized', 'historical', 'aspects', 'movie', 'nothing', 'else', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'movie', 'conversation', 'starter']",JFK Director's Cut

Jim Garrison raised about the Kennedy Assassination in his book &quot;On The Trail of the Assassins.&quot;  This film is a tour-de-force by Oliver Stone, and was very controversial for mixing new footage with real archived film clips in a way that many felt would only mislead the uninformed.  They have a point - some details of the arguments here don't hold up to careful scrutiny (truly interested persons should check out other sources, such as Gerald Posner's &quot;Case Closed&quot;) but the amazing thing about this film is that in just a few hours, it gives an amazingly rich &quot;crash course&quot; in the controversies surrounding the assassination investigation.  It successfully conveys Garrison's point of view as a well-intentioned professional who descends from a normal sense of early-60s civic pride into a multi-year journey of doubt about U.S. democracy, and anxiety regarding social changes.  The Cold War, Cuban Missile Crisis and Vietnam, political unrest and assassinations of the 60s...  This is a truly impressive film at relating one man's loss of civic faith, even if you disagree completely with the premises it explores.  It is loaded with stars and cameo appearances.  It can be enjoyed (or studied) again and again.  Particularly notable on the DVD is an interview with Fletcher Prouty, the real version of the film's &quot;Mr. X&quot; that encouraged and guided Garrison's suspicions.  Gary Oldman gives a completely knockout performance as Lee Harvey Oswald, and in my opinion this film also contains the best performance I've seen from Kevin Costner!  Surely only its controversy kept this from Best Picture Oscar possibilities.  What an amazing piece of filmmaking!  And the entire film is contained on one disc, too!",5,Wow!!!

Eisenhower warning against the accumalation of power my  the military industrial complex. His theory is that the army and the  overall war machine need a war inorder to justify their existance and  maintain their power. He names names, like Bell Helicopter and General  Dynamics, companies that had Billions to lose in the event of world  piece.The imagery, theories, drama and ideas contained in 30 seconds  of sceen time of this film exceed what other films contain in their entire  running time. As the film starts  we are told by voice-over that there is a  secret war being waged by the CIA and angry Cuban exhiles against Castro,  Kennedy inherits this war which leads to the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion  which ofcourse was a complete disaster. Kennedy wants to make piece with  the Russians, wants to pull out of Vietnam and thus is labeled a communist  and an &quot;Irish bleeding heart&quot;. What follows is a vast conspiracy  between all branches of the government, the mob and the Cuban exhiles to  assasinate him. One of Jim Garrison's assitants logically asks him  &quot;How on earth can you keep a conspiracy like that running between all  these people when you know for a fact that you can't keep a secret between  12 people in this room?&quot; That is a logical question, and Stone  concedes that his film is partly a theory, but what he does is much more  important that prove WHO killed JFK, because &quot;WHO&quot; as the  mysterious Mr.X (Donald Sutherland) puts it is just scenery for the public,  what Stone does show is &quot;WHY&quot; he was killed.The root of  all the conspiracies in JFK is the office of an ex-FBI man, now working as  a PI in New Orleans. His name is Guy Banister(Ed Asner), and he doesn't  seem to do any PI work at all, through his office every character in the  conspiracy will pass, from Lee Harvey Oswald(Gary Oldman), Clay Shaw(Tommy  Lee Jones) and Dave Ferry (Joe Pesci). They are all rabid anti-communists,  scheming how to get rid of the beard(Castro), organising militias in the  anti Castro movement. All this in the same street in New Orleans as the  offices of the FBI, CIA, Secret Service and ONI. Bizarrely Oswald who as  the Warren Comission would have people believe was a &quot;communist&quot;  chose to spend most of his time there. It is obvious that he was being set  up from the biginning, perhaps even setting himself up as the  &quot;sacrificial lamb&quot;.All this may make this film look like an  incomprehensible flood of political jargon, but what make Stone's  achievement a near miracle is that all this is wrapped is a package that is  riveting, fixating, gripping and brilliant from start to finish. I could  use all the positive adjectives in the world and not come close to  describing the impact of this film. Stone mixes documentary footage with  black and white and colour photography to create a hypnotic whole that  feels dangerous. He manages to give the audience a feeling that they're  seeing classified information they are not supposed to see. There are  numerous cameos by big stars in small roles like John Candy, Walter Mathou,  Jack Lemmon and Kevin Bacon just to name a few, but these are not  distractions, they give a film a measure of importance. Throw in John  Williams superb score and Robert Richardson's beautiful photography and  turning away from the screen is simply not an option.There isn't space  to praise all the performances in the film, but three particularly stand  out. Tommy Lee Jones as Clay Shaw, Joe Pesci as the manic Dave Ferry and  surpirisingly Kevin Costner in the lead role as Jim Garrison.

93353,A1W1ONKNMIHP99,0790729733,MrSherlockHolmes,"[1, 1]","Oliver Stone does an excellent job of arguing the case for a conspiracy in the assassination of JFK. The facts, and some of the unexplained mysteries, all documented, are presented to the viewer in a most compelling way. You come away from the film wondering if there really was a conspiracy.This movie does not have the feeling of paranoia that most other movies about conspiracy have, and here I am thinking of &quot;The Enemy of the State&quot; for example. The calm and rational development of the argument, with more information gradually added distinguishes this work from other more frivolous films. A line in the film which I think is quite telling is that if the assassination had happened in Russia, and the facts were as they are, would the idea of a conspiracy be that hard to swallow. It may be the willingness of the public to disbelieve the possibility of a Government that works against it's people, rather than the lack of facts, which makes conspiracy so difficult to believe for many people.Even though Stone was true to the facts as he found them (or as others furnished them), he did take artistic license in some areas. This does not make the point that the movie is trying to make any less valid. Any movie about historical events, usually has some sort of creativity in it regarding minor events such as the flawlessness of the speeches, flashbacks, additional dialogues etc...If you aren't one who buys into Conspiracy but who enjoys a good film, Costner's performance is stunning in this one and wont disappoint. The movie, in it's own right is excellent, and I would highly recommend it for it's own sake.

Doyle ""film buff""","[2, 3]","Conspiracy theories get a workout in Oliver Stone's JFK--he has hit upon every conceivable theory, every point and counterpoint to be made and has produced an absorbing, involving, and ultimately entertaining film that makes you think about which theory you believe is the likeliest. And he has a cast that brings every important character to life, even though the physical resemblances are not always there.KEVIN COSTNER, for example, is excellent as the doggedly determined D.A. Jim Garrison (but looks nothing like the real Jim Garrison) who will leave no stone unturned in his effort to find the truth behind the killing of JFK--even if it means ignoring his wife and family while he pursues justice. Costner uses his Honest Abe image to give the sort of heartfelt, man-of-integrity intensity that James Stewart and Henry Fonda might have given in their day. He is made to seem like a towering figure of integrity in the script Stone has written from Jim Garrison's point of view--almost like Atticus Finch resurrected, especially in his closing courtroom speech. Was the real Jim Garrison really this noble?As a note of irony, Stone has the real Jim Garrison playing Earl Warren and defending the Warren Commission Report with a straight face.Other roles are played with equal validity by Tommy Lee Jones (as Clay Shaw), Kevin Bacon, Sissy Spacek, Ed Asner (infuriating as Guy Bannister), and Joe Pesci as David Ferrie. Pesci is a bit over the top as David Ferrie (and gets on the nerves) but that's the way the role was written and directed.But the most remarkable moments in the film are provided by the exchange of information between Kevin Costner and Donald Sutherland as the extent of the conspiracy is revealed to come from higher places in the government. Sutherland gives an imposing performance, quietly restrained but chilling as he delivers his insider information.Special mention must go to Gary Oldman as Lee Harvey Oswald. His face, voice and gestures are strikingly similar and blend well with actual footage of Oswald intermittently seen.Altogether a very competent piece of filmmaking which fulfills its purpose by making the viewer think about what might actually have happened on that awful day in Dallas when the age of innocence officially ended in American politics. Whether it's the Mafia, Castro's Cubans, the FBI, the CIA or LBJ and the Pentagon (with the help of the Warren Commission), it's all there for you to sort out and ponder--perhaps until 2029 when some new suppressed evidence will eventually be released.",4,Speculative but riveting...mind-provoking conspiracy theories...,1186272000,"08 5, 2007",2007,2547,"['Conspiracy', 'theories', 'get', 'workout', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'JFK', 'hit', 'conceivable', 'theory', 'point', 'counterpoint', 'be', 'made', 'produced', 'absorbing', 'involving', 'ultimately', 'entertaining', 'film', 'think', 'theory', 'believe', 'likeliest', 'cast', 'important', 'character', 'life', 'even', 'physical', 'resemblances', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'there.KEVIN', 'COSTNER', 'example', 'excellent', 'doggedly', 'determined', 'D.A', 'Jim', 'Garrison', 'nothing', 'real', 'Jim', 'Garrison', 'who', 'will', 'leave', 'stone', 'unturned', 'effort', 'find', 'truth', 'killing', 'JFK', 'even', 'ignoring', 'wife', 'family', 'justice', 'Costner', 'Honest', 'Abe', 'image', 'give', 'sort', 'heartfelt', 'man-of-integrity', 'intensity', 'James', 'Stewart', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'might', 'have', 'given', 'day', 'made', 'seem', 'towering', 'figure', 'integrity', 'script', 'Stone', 'written', 'Jim', 'Garrison', 'point', 'view', 'almost', 'Atticus', 'Finch', 'resurrected', 'especially', 'closing', 'courtroom', 'speech', 'Was', 'real', 'Jim', 'Garrison', 'really', 'noble', 'note', 'irony', 'Stone', 'real', 'Jim', 'Garrison', 'playing', 'Earl', 'Warren', 'defending', 'Warren', 'Commission', 'Report', 'straight', 'face.Other', 'roles', 'are', 'played', 'equal', 'validity', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'Clay', 'Shaw', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'Ed', 'Asner', 'infuriating', 'Guy', 'Bannister', 'Joe', 'Pesci', 'David', 'Ferrie', 'Pesci', 'bit', 'top', 'David', 'Ferrie', 'nerves', 'way', 'role', 'was', 'written', 'directed.But', 'most', 'remarkable', 'moments', 'film', 'are', 'provided', 'exchange', 'information', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'extent', 'conspiracy', 'revealed', 'come', 'higher', 'places', 'government', 'Sutherland', 'imposing', 'performance', 'quietly', 'restrained', 'chilling', 'insider', 'information.Special', 'mention', 'must', 'go', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'Lee', 'Harvey', 'Oswald', 'face', 'voice', 'gestures', 'are', 'strikingly', 'similar', 'blend', 'well', 'actual', 'footage', 'Oswald', 'intermittently', 'very', 'competent', 'piece', 'filmmaking', 'purpose', 'making', 'viewer', 'think', 'what', 'might', 'actually', 'have', 'happened', 'awful', 'day', 'Dallas', 'when', 'age', 'innocence', 'officially', 'ended', 'American', 'politics', 'Mafia', 'Castro', 'Cubans', 'FBI', 'CIA', 'LBJ', 'Pentagon', 'help', 'Warren', 'Commission', 'there', 'sort', 'out', 'ponder', 'perhaps', '2029', 'when', 'new', 'suppressed', 'evidence', 'will', 'eventually', 'be', 'released']",JFK Director's Cut

It is to my knowledge the best comprehensive study of the circumstances in and around Dealy Plaza on Nov. 22, as well as giving many researchers a chance to speak about their findings over a 30+ year period of investigation. One of the things that makes the series so interesting is the research done into all the possible shooters that were retained for the job.The only failing of the series is that there is no mention of the shot that came from the storm sewer to the right of the motorcade (which probably blew his head off ), or the dozens of people who died of mysterious heart attacks and accidents in the weeks following the assassination. As far as I know though, nobody has made mention of this to date except a few of the more eccentric researchers into the assassination.The best research into the reasons that Kennedy was murdered for me, came from Prevailing Winds Research Magazine based in Santa Barbara Ca.. It was explained to me in an understandable way that Kennedy was trying to stop the involvement of the United States in the Vietnam War, and was setting up parallel intelligence agencies that were in direct conflict with the established CIA that was born out of WWII and the mass recruitment of NAZI's. These were just a few of the many things that Kennedy did to bury himself.

93367,AD0J5KK4WQXNS,0790729733,OverTheMoon,"[1, 5]","The Warren Report is the basic starting point for anybody who is even remotely interested in researching the JFK assassination. The book is massive - nearly 2 inches thick, 9 inches in length and 6 inches in width and clocks in at 888 pages. There are many illustrations and photographs to help break the monotony and they are helpful in understanding the text.Be forewarned. This report is not to be taken at face value. It promotes itself while at the same time laying blame on everybody from Oswald to the Secret Service and the Dallas County Police. The movie JFK is critical of this book's findings, because of its omissions. This is what the movie JFK hopes to explore.The warren commission report starts with its summary and conclusions - that Oswald acted alone in killing President Kennedy and that there was no conspiracy. It then gives a brief synopsis of the assassination and the circumstances surrounding the events on November 22nd 1963. We see these in the movie. The report continues by developing the scenario in the Texas School Book Depository including the evidence gained from witnesses at the scene and the recovery of the riffle, spent shells and prints. Connections are established between Oswald and the riffle and the School Book Depository building before moving on to the motive and Oswald's background, Oswald's detention, the media, Oswald's murder and his assassin - Jack Ruby. The film is mostly about dealing with investigating a possible conspiracy, challenging the Warren report in-depth with expert witness testimony, with the big court room showdown that in the end leaves you feeling that Oswald did not do it.Great movie, through and through. Hard not to love it. Why only 4 stars?Oswald was involved in the slaying of Officer J.D Tippit and this is a clincher. The murder of patrolman Tippit is a key event which shows that Oswald was capable of murder and was also on a killing frenzy at the time of the assassination. The movie really does bend the reality of this problem by saying that it was a number of agents pretending to be Oswald.He also tried to shoot officers when he was apprehended in the film theatre. Did Oswald shoot President Kennedy? Probably Yes. Could the Magic bullet theory work? It is possible. Did Jack Ruby kill Oswald on the spur of the moment? The facts surrounding this are vague. Did Oswald act alone? It is possible but unlikely. Does the Warren report do justice for the American people and the people of the world? Absolutely not. Does the Warren report deliberately neglect important and relevant information? Absolutely. Would an impartial jury convict Oswald on the assassination of President Kennedy based on the evidence? Probably not because there is too much doubt at large to deal with. Would an impartial jury convict Oswald of the murder J.D Tippit? Yes. Is there a cover-up and if so why?The truth is that there is probably a cover-up involved and the Warren report as it stands today is absolute proof that the US government at the time was knee-deep in a conspiracy of some kind simply based on its omissions and neglect to deal with highly important and relevant evidence. Was there a government conspiracy to assassinate the President? Probably not, but there was a cover-up of a conspiracy of some kind and this is what is at the heart of the whole assassination and the follow up events including this report. A blind eye has probably been turned to the truth surrounding the assassination because President Kennedy was considered an obstacle to many important people. In fact the Warren Commission report has all the hallmarks of a new administration that just wants to sweep everything under the carpet.But in closing I will say this. Go try the real world simulation run of  JFKreloaded and you will see that it might be possible to actually reproduce the magic bullet. You can actually hit the President 3 times no problem, including the fatal headshot. Oswald could have done it. The simulation clearly shows that you can do it also.",4,Was there a conspiracy?

The film is based on the investigation that was started by New Orleans D.A. Jim Garrison.  The film is a visual marvel, with flashbacks, quick cuts, some scenes in color, some in black and white, all perfectly weaved together for a tight cohesive film.  The view of the film is that President Kennedy was killed by Cuban sympathizers and Lee Harvey Oswald was a part of the conspiracy, but was set up as the fall guy.  Whether you believe this theory to be true or if you think Mr. Stone is full of hot air, one can't deny the power of the film.  Kevin Costner stars as Jim Garrison and leads an all star cast that includes Sissy Spacek (as his wife), Ed Asner, Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Tommy Lee Jones, Joe Pesci, John Candy, Kevin Bacon, Donald Sutherland and Gary Oldham who is perfectly creepy as Oswald.  JFK followed Platoon, Born On The Fourth Of July &amp; The Doors and completed Mr. Stone's look at the 60's.

The cast is superb.  Not only is it all-star, but Stone has somehow managed to cast against type and get wonderful performances.  He casts Ed Asner, a liberal in real life, as a stone-age murderous rightwing fruitcake.  He casts rockjawed Tommy Lee Jones as the swishy effeminate Clay Shaw.  He casts usually tough-as-nails self-sufficient Sissy Spacek as timid hausfrau Mrs. Garrison.  He casts Kevin Costner, real-life rightwinger, as partisan of JFK and nemesis of the Military Industrial Complex.  He even casts Jim Garrison himself as Earl Warren, the Supreme Court Justice who denounces Jim Garrison!And they all deliver wonderful performances.  So does almost everybody in the movie.I believe that Oswald was not solely guilty, that there must have been some kind of wider gallery of shooters.  But unlike Stone, I don't think the killing of one president, however charismatic, really did change or really could change US history much.  The US is an oligarchy, of by and for the wealthy, and that isn't likely to change.But the movie is wonderfully inspiring, and almost Capraesque in its faith in democracy.

I knew more about the assassination than the later trial in New Orleans.  Frankly, that whole episode seemed like a political side show.  However, I'm glad to have found out more about Garrison's investigation.  My own personal opinion of the assassination was that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone.  The surge of conspiracy books and theories was overwhelming in the years after 1963.  I recall an earlier film that I believe was titled ""Executive Action"" which starred, among others, Robert Ryan and Burt Lancaster.  An impressive part of that film was the closing list of all the people directly or indirectly involved in the investigation who had died under unusual circumstances.  Frankly, it was the enormity of those who believed in a conspiracy that gave me the greatest assurance that there was none.  After all, how would you keep such an elaborate scheme such a secret over so many decades?  People eventually talk and the theory that those who knew were eliminated ignored the presumed fact that this would merely end up involving more and more people.As a practical person, I found myself caught in between my self-assurance and the suspenseful creation of the conspiracy in ""JFK"".  I decided, for the sake of art appreciation, to just let myself enjoy the movie...and I did.  My one objection to the movie was the depiction of Garrison's family life.  It slowed down the movie, distracted us from the suspense, and unnecessarily made a bigger hero out of Jim Garrison than the movie required.  If it were all true then what did his homelife matter?""JFK"" excels because even non-believers can set reality aside and enjoy an excellent suspenseful drama.  The acting, directing, writing etc is all very well done.As a side light to ""JFK"", the next movie I watched was ""The Paralax View"".  I had no idea that I was watching essentially the same political assassination theme.  This one went out of its' way to be out on the fringe.  It's concept of assassination for assasination's sake made me realize that Oliver Stone knew that the greater the dose of reality, the more engrossing the suspense.

But on the whole, it gets enough of it correct and still manages to be surprisingly fair for such an admittedly subjective film.In spite of even John Marrs' (???) alleged influence, the movie JFK does a phenomenal job portraying the story from Jim Garrison's own perspective -- paranoia, stubbornness, fixation on Clay Shaw, and all.  It even presents, in the heat of the moment, the automatic assumptions attributing the MLK and RFK assassinations to the same conspiracy.  I mean, who wouldn't?  It was insanity.  You had the CIA purposely sabotaging his investigation (Helms and Marchetti both admitted this later), death threats, witnesses changing stories or dying, evidence the FBI, Secret Service, Dallas PD, and Warren Commission had subverted the original investigation (which we now know is also a fact, regardless of the motives).  The whole world seemed to be closing in around him.  His wife even brings up his apparent persecution of Shaw's alleged homosexuality, something others would rely on later to try and discredit Garrison, including the next DA Harry Connick Sr (yes, the dad), who gained notoriety for trying to withhold the Garrison files from the ARRB by throwing a former cop and reporter in jail.True, Garrison wasn't even in the courtroom for much the trial; he didn't need to be.  That wouldn't have been very interesting or entertaining for a film, though, which works best with a central protagonist up front and center doing the most visible work.  Garrison also wasn't present to see David Ferrie's rant about ""a mystery wrapped up in an enigma""... or words to that effect, but it works better than him hearing it from the colleague second hand.  Garrison did roughly make a similar, rousing closing speech at the trial, however.  And years later the judge even said he regretted that Shaw got off.  We know now that Shaw and Bertrand were the same person, he did work for the agency, and was involved in overseas plots.  We also know that Walter Sheridan at NBC was trained by the CIA and then sheep-dipped into NSA.  So they had been literally 'out to get' Garrison.  I would complain there's a lack of the religious and extremist component that Garrison stumbled upon.  It gets even weirder.  I suppose for the early 1990s, bringing that up may have prevented the film from even being made.Whether he took full advantage of it, or not, Stone does have an exceptional knowledge of the subject.  In a forum coinciding with the film's release, he was clearly the strongest debater.  Others, like Edward Epstein, were forced to concede numerous facts to him.  Though on the right general track, I do not think Garrison was necessarily correct on all accounts.  That does not change the issue that justice was obstructed.  The excuse may have been that Shaw was innocent and national security was at stake.  Perhaps so, but there's a reason the process was not allowed to produce that conclusion itself.  Certainly you can't blame Garrison for pointing in the direction of the dirty laundry when he smelled something rotten.  Nor is it appropriate to disparage those who think there might be more to the case.",4,"As a film, it sure is spectacular.",1128124800,"10 1, 2005",2005,3909,"['Sure', 'sorts', 'liberties', 'Even', 'subtract', 'understandable', 'dramatic', 'license', 'combined', 'characters', 'name', 'changes', 'other', 'switch-a-roos', 'can', 'expect', 'movie', 'based', 'real', 'events', 'where', 'mysterious', 'amounts', 'money', 'lawyers', 'seeming', 'be', 'protecting', 'certain', 'individuals', 'needed', 'scrutiny', 'are', 'still', 'inaccuracies', 'film', 'Stone', 'admitted', 'said', 'JFK', 'meant', 'get', 'people', 'ask', 'questions', 'not', 'final', 'authoritative', 'word', 'one', 'undeniably', 'plausible', 'possibility', ""'ll"", 'pardon', 'reversal', 'phrase', 'also', 'have', 'take', 'account', 'Newman', 'Prouty', 'had', 'much', 'influence', 'shaping', 'final', 'conclusions', 'film', 'assassination', 'Garrison', 'whole', 'enough', 'correct', 'still', 'be', 'surprisingly', 'fair', 'such', 'admittedly', 'subjective', 'film.In', 'spite', 'even', 'John', 'Marrs', 'alleged', 'influence', 'movie', 'JFK', 'phenomenal', 'job', 'portraying', 'story', 'Jim', 'Garrison', 'own', 'perspective', 'paranoia', 'stubbornness', 'fixation', 'Clay', 'Shaw', 'even', 'heat', 'moment', 'automatic', 'assumptions', 'attributing', 'MLK', 'RFK', 'assassinations', 'same', 'conspiracy', 'mean', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'was', 'insanity', 'had', 'CIA', 'purposely', 'sabotaging', 'investigation', 'Helms', 'Marchetti', 'admitted', 'later', 'death', 'threats', 'witnesses', 'changing', 'stories', 'dying', 'evidence', 'FBI', 'Secret', 'Service', 'Dallas', 'PD', 'Warren', 'Commission', 'had', 'subverted', 'original', 'investigation', 'now', 'know', 'also', 'fact', 'regardless', 'motives', 'whole', 'world', 'seemed', 'be', 'closing', 'wife', 'even', 'up', 'apparent', 'persecution', 'Shaw', 'alleged', 'homosexuality', 'something', 'others', 'would', 'rely', 'later', 'try', 'discredit', 'Garrison', 'including', 'next', 'DA', 'Harry', 'Connick', 'Sr', 'yes', 'dad', 'who', 'gained', 'notoriety', 'trying', 'withhold', 'Garrison', 'files', 'ARRB', 'throwing', 'former', 'cop', 'reporter', 'jail.True', 'Garrison', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'courtroom', 'much', 'trial', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'very', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'film', 'best', 'central', 'protagonist', 'front', 'center', 'doing', 'most', 'visible', 'work', 'Garrison', 'also', 'was', ""n't"", 'present', 'see', 'David', 'Ferrie', 'rant', 'mystery', 'wrapped', 'up', 'enigma', 'words', 'effect', 'better', 'hearing', 'colleague', 'second', 'hand', 'Garrison', 'did', 'roughly', 'make', 'similar', 'rousing', 'closing', 'speech', 'trial', 'however', 'years', 'later', 'judge', 'even', 'said', 'regretted', 'Shaw', 'got', 'off', 'know', 'now', 'Shaw', 'Bertrand', 'were', 'same', 'person', 'did', 'work', 'agency', 'was', 'involved', 'overseas', 'plots', 'also', 'know', 'Walter', 'Sheridan', 'NBC', 'was', 'trained', 'CIA', 'then', 'sheep-dipped', 'NSA', 'had', 'been', 'literally', ""'out"", 'get', 'Garrison', 'would', 'complain', 'lack', 'religious', 'extremist', 'component', 'Garrison', 'stumbled', 'upon', 'even', 'weirder', 'suppose', 'early', '1990s', 'bringing', 'up', 'may', 'have', 'prevented', 'film', 'even', 'being', 'took', 'full', 'advantage', 'not', 'Stone', 'have', 'exceptional', 'knowledge', 'subject', 'forum', 'coinciding', 'film', 'release', 'was', 'clearly', 'strongest', 'debater', 'Others', 'Edward', 'Epstein', 'were', 'forced', 'concede', 'numerous', 'facts', 'right', 'general', 'track', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'Garrison', 'was', 'necessarily', 'correct', 'accounts', 'not', 'change', 'issue', 'justice', 'was', 'obstructed', 'excuse', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'Shaw', 'was', 'innocent', 'national', 'security', 'was', 'stake', 'Perhaps', 'so', 'reason', 'process', 'was', 'not', 'allowed', 'produce', 'conclusion', 'Certainly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'blame', 'Garrison', 'pointing', 'direction', 'dirty', 'laundry', 'when', 'smelled', 'something', 'rotten', 'appropriate', 'disparage', 'who', 'think', 'might', 'be', 'more', 'case']",JFK Director's Cut

The masterpiece of the lot is his controversial take on the 1963 assassination of President Kennedy. This terrific two-disc set includes a riveting and highly detailed audio track by writer/director Stone as well as 17 added minutes to the now 223 minute feature. In Disc B, there's a collection of deleted and extended scenes with optional commentary by Stone and multimedia essays that update the assassination.I was in Dallas on the eve of that fateful day. I remember an eerie, blood-red moon hanging over the flower-strewn grassy knoll at midnight. Later, I spoke to a baffled policeman who was running beside the President's car.  I heard many bizarre stories regarding the immediate aftermath of the events of that day including a witness, a local weatherman on WFAA, who claimed he saw Ruby and Oswald together at Dealy Plaza 24 hours before the death of JFK. Like Stone observes, ""Once you enter the rabbit hole, there's no coming back."" This gripping mystery-thriller stands on its own as a great piece of technical filmmaking whether fact or fiction (or both). Stone's incredible commentary raises the drama to a new level -- and is a valuable historical document.

93393,A2WSI8HOWHFDOT,0790729733,Rocco Dormarunno,"[10, 13]","No matter which side of the fence you're on regarding the JFK assassination, Oliver Stone's JFK is a provocative and frightening film which, as critic David Denby said, ""would scare God."" Critics have said that the film ought to be dismissed because it manipulates facts and history. Well, okay, but the same could be said about TORA! TORA! TORA!, THE LONGEST DAY, and PATTON, but the critics were strangely silent about the liberties those filmmakers took with history. And although there is no mistaking what Stone thinks happened on 11/22/63, Kevin Costner, as Jim Garrison, repeats countless times, ""Let us speculate..."", ""We can assume..."", ""What if..."". This is a movie about speculating, and about the frightful implications of the possible results.As others have mentioned, most of the casting and the performances are perfect. For my money, though, nothing beats British-born Gary Oldman's convincing portrayal of Lee Harvey Oswald. I was stunned by his brilliance. Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Bacon, Cissy Spacek, and the dozens of other cameos were equally beyond amazing (although, at times, Joe Pesci sounded more like he was from New Jersey than New Orleans). In this edition of the film are scenes that were edited out from the version released in theatres, and you'll easily understand why. They aren't bad scenes at all (the scene of John LaRoquette and Mort Sahl as thinly disguised Johnny Carson and Ed McMahon is very good) but they don't add much to the story. The accompanying documentary ""Beyond JFK"" is interesting but flat when compared with Stone's film. Still it's worth a view.The real stars of this show, however, are Oliver Stone's meticulous direction, Robert Richardson's eerie and engaging cinematography (for which he won an Oscar), and the frenetic editing job by Joe Hutshing and Pietro Scalia (also Oscar winners). This team flawlessly paces this three-hour film: rushing it up at the dramatic moments, cooling it down when the audience needs to digest the data. Like Scorsese's RAGING BULL, the filmmakers employ several types of cameras and films, moving from dolly shots to hand-held, color to black-and-white, grainy to clean. The effect is a dazzling and haunting recreation of what may have happened in Dealey Plaza on November 22, 1963 and what that day did to those, like Jim Garrison, who attempted to find the truth.",5,The Art of Fear,1071014400,"12 10, 2003",2003,2358,"['matter', 'side', 'fence', ""'re"", 'regarding', 'JFK', 'assassination', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'JFK', 'provocative', 'frightening', 'film', 'critic', 'David', 'Denby', 'said', 'would', 'scare', 'God', 'Critics', 'have', 'said', 'film', 'ought', 'be', 'dismissed', 'facts', 'history', 'Well', 'okay', 'same', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'TORA', 'TORA', 'TORA', 'LONGEST', 'DAY', 'PATTON', 'critics', 'were', 'strangely', 'silent', 'liberties', 'filmmakers', 'took', 'history', 'mistaking', 'what', 'Stone', 'happened', '11/22/63', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'Jim', 'Garrison', 'countless', 'times', 'Let', 'speculate', 'can', 'assume', 'What', 'movie', 'speculating', 'frightful', 'implications', 'possible', 'results.As', 'others', 'have', 'mentioned', 'most', 'casting', 'performances', 'are', 'perfect', 'money', 'though', 'nothing', 'beats', 'British-born', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'convincing', 'portrayal', 'Lee', 'Harvey', 'Oswald', 'was', 'stunned', 'brilliance', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'Cissy', 'Spacek', 'dozens', 'other', 'cameos', 'were', 'equally', 'amazing', 'times', 'Joe', 'Pesci', 'sounded', 'more', 'was', 'New', 'Jersey', 'New', 'Orleans', 'edition', 'film', 'are', 'scenes', 'were', 'edited', 'out', 'version', 'released', 'theatres', ""'ll"", 'easily', 'understand', 'why', 'are', ""n't"", 'bad', 'scenes', 'scene', 'John', 'LaRoquette', 'Mort', 'Sahl', 'thinly', 'disguised', 'Johnny', 'Carson', 'Ed', 'McMahon', 'very', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'add', 'much', 'story', 'accompanying', 'documentary', 'Beyond', 'JFK', 'interesting', 'flat', 'when', 'compared', 'Stone', 'film', 'Still', 'view.The', 'real', 'stars', 'show', 'however', 'are', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'meticulous', 'direction', 'Robert', 'Richardson', 'eerie', 'engaging', 'cinematography', 'won', 'Oscar', 'frenetic', 'editing', 'job', 'Joe', 'Hutshing', 'Pietro', 'Scalia', 'also', 'Oscar', 'winners', 'team', 'flawlessly', 'three-hour', 'film', 'rushing', 'up', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'cooling', 'down', 'when', 'audience', 'digest', 'data', 'Scorsese', 'RAGING', 'BULL', 'filmmakers', 'employ', 'several', 'types', 'cameras', 'films', 'moving', 'dolly', 'shots', 'hand-held', 'color', 'black-and-white', 'grainy', 'clean', 'effect', 'dazzling', 'haunting', 'recreation', 'what', 'may', 'have', 'happened', 'Dealey', 'Plaza', 'November', '22', '1963', 'what', 'day', 'did', 'Jim', 'Garrison', 'who', 'attempted', 'find', 'truth']",JFK Director's Cut

In my first watching of this film, I detected at least one major, and I think deliberate, factual error.  One of the characters is handing a Carcano rifle as another character says words to the effect, ""The three shots took 7.8 seconds to fire.  Let's time it.""  He then picks up a stopwatch and clicks, ""Go.""  The other character, works the action [once], he works the action again [twice], he works the action a third time [three].  ""9.2 seconds,"" the one man emotes.  ""Impossible.""Well, from reading over reports of the shooting I knew that this scenario was an untruth.  The timing was from the moment of the sound of the first shot--a couple of seconds after the first levering.Fascinated by such an obvious error and, considering the fact that I am a pathologist and a shooter, I decided to redo the entire shooting scenario--personally--using the same type Carcano-Mannlicher rifle and the same type ammunition that the FBI claimed Oswald used.  I performed accuracy, rate of fire, bullet penetration, bullet deformation, head deflection and other studies.  By the time I was finished, I probably did as much ballistic work with the Kennedy shooting as anyone in the world, not excluding the FBI and CIA.If you're interested in the results of my ballistic studies, try my website at [...][...]Ron Braithwaite, MD, author of novels--""Skull Rack"" and ""Hummingbird God""--on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico",3,Sixth Floor Window,1219881600,"08 28, 2008",2008,1526,"[""'ve"", 'rated', 'Stone', ""'JFK"", '3', 'stars', 'not', 'quality', 'accuracy', 'movie', 'had', 'major', 'impact', 'first', 'watching', 'film', 'detected', 'least', 'one', 'major', 'think', 'deliberate', 'factual', 'error', 'One', 'characters', 'handing', 'Carcano', 'rifle', 'character', 'words', 'effect', 'three', 'shots', 'took', '7.8', 'seconds', 'fire', 'Let', 'time', 'then', 'up', 'stopwatch', 'clicks', 'Go', 'other', 'character', 'action', 'once', ']', 'action', 'again', '[', 'twice', ']', 'action', 'third', 'time', '[', 'three', ']', '9.2', 'seconds', 'one', 'man', 'Impossible', 'Well', 'reading', 'over', 'reports', 'shooting', 'knew', 'scenario', 'was', 'untruth', 'timing', 'was', 'moment', 'sound', 'first', 'shot', 'couple', 'seconds', 'first', 'levering.Fascinated', 'such', 'obvious', 'error', 'considering', 'fact', 'am', 'pathologist', 'shooter', 'decided', 'redo', 'entire', 'shooting', 'scenario', 'personally', 'using', 'same', 'type', 'Carcano-Mannlicher', 'rifle', 'same', 'type', 'ammunition', 'FBI', 'claimed', 'Oswald', 'used', 'performed', 'accuracy', 'rate', 'fire', 'bullet', 'penetration', 'bullet', 'deformation', 'head', 'deflection', 'other', 'studies', 'time', 'was', 'finished', 'probably', 'did', 'as', 'much', 'ballistic', 'work', 'Kennedy', 'shooting', 'anyone', 'world', 'not', 'excluding', 'FBI', 'CIA.If', ""'re"", 'interested', 'results', 'ballistic', 'studies', 'try', 'website', '[', ']', '[', ']', 'Ron', 'Braithwaite', 'MD', 'author', 'novels', 'Skull', 'Rack', 'Hummingbird', 'God', 'Spanish', 'Conquest', 'Mexico']",JFK Director's Cut

After WWII, we realized we could not ever be  caught unprepared for war in a nuclear age, so we continued on in a state  of ""cold"" war. JFK wanted to change this in the middle of the  ""Cold War""; bad timing for sure. All of those that quibble (look  the word up) about Stone's details or pronounce the ""LHO did it""  have never fired a weapon in U.S. military service, least of all a cruddy  Mannlicher-Carcano. Get one and just try manipulating the bolt fast enough  for 3 shots. Then try aiming and proper breathing/trigger control. Next,  watch the head of JFK react backwards from a frontal shot in Stone's  showing of the Zapruder film, proving a frontal shot from a second gunman.  Next ponder on the FACT that the next U.S. Government assasination  investigation concluded it WAS a conspiracy requiring 2 or more gunmen. The  official U.S. Government position is that there WAS A CONSPIRACY. The  Warren Commission misconclusion has been superseded. Now what are YOU going  to do about it?The point is the people of America have become cowards,  the secret government knows that it has to do all our dirty work because we  certainly will not do it. This is why they knew they could remove the  elected President by coup d'etat and get away with it, as they then  proceeded to kill RFK, MLK, Malcolm-X and George Wallace, don't forget they  shot Reagen, too---anyone who offered a shimmer of hope of ""being his  own man"" while in public office/position of visibility that could  awaken the lazy Gen-Me/X/Y generations.What died that day in Dallas was  the belief that a charismatic leader could inspire the populace of America  to get involved in our government. Since that time its been all ""down  hill"".  And who is to blame?We are.When we become more  intelligent as Stone's films can make us realize the nature of things, then  we can take a more active role in government without the secret caretakers  of this Republic getting alarmed and feel like they have to assassinate us.  It took a tremendous amount of courage for Oliver Stone to make this film,  and I salute everyone in the cast, too. The point of this film is to be a  charismatic THINKING leader in your own right and not let the ""bad  people scare you"" as Garrison tells his children.Stone shows why  the men who killed JFK were angry at him, and they have good reasons for  their wrong doing. Still makes it wrong, but ""good people"" can do  bad things. Look at Nazi Germany--we are not immune from mob or  group-think. You don't offer to disarm in the face of world communism. See  Stone's Nixon and this will be clear, too. However, the conspirators that  killed our charismatic leaders are wrong because America needs people of  charisma holding things together at every level, they alone can't do it  all. If they wanted JFK out of office, see to it that he was voted, not  SHOT out of office. What we have here today is a slow death of America at  many levels by a pervading lack of trust in the people in our government,  partially because we cannot seem to elect good people into office or if we  did, not have them shot out.The movie clearly poses the question of  whether we are going to continue as a nation based on just a war footing  run by others or are we going to stop being selfish consumerists content to  let others handle the pressing matters of the nation? Or will we like  Garrison/JFK seek and find the truth, dare to be different and spend our  lives doing things far more interesting like space colonization and make  that our nation's reason for existance? We need a competent  military-industrial complex or we will not survive as a nation, but we will  not survive long if we don't get an enlightened citizenry that is able to  understand the complexities of the world (not quibble in order to sit on  one's rear) and assume the responsibility of our nation without disarming  in the face of the external enemy. The internal enemies are tougher. I  think we know who they are. We have met the enemy and he is us.",5,"Best Governmental Corruption Movie, Ever. Period.

93403,AYAMBDEDF4N1C,0790729733,sandalista,"[14, 43]","JFK, the worst of Oliver Stone, begins with General Eisenhower's 1961 warning to America about the complex miscegnation of the military & industry.  Eisenhower's warning, which has totemic or iconic status on the Left because it seemed to presage a half-vast right-wing conspiracy, was apparently abbreviated for public consumption.  According to the leftist New York Review of Books, the old general intended to denounce an unholy alliance of militarism, industry, and Congressional Democrats who berated Ike for Cold War bomber gaps and missile gaps that he knew didn't exist.  One of the Democrats demanding more billions of dollars for useless armaments against the USSR was Senator John Kennedy, who almost certainly knew the gaps, if they existed, were in our favor, not theirs.Oliver Stone and his JFK fantasy are oblivous to truth and nuance;  they are deadly to history.  Even as dystopian fantasy, letting a thousand rotten fleurs du mal of fever-swamp conspiracy wilt & die in the light of day, Stone's JFK doesn't work.  That's mostly because Costner doesn't work as Garrison, Garrison doesn't work as Warren, & Warren probably got it right the first time:  the best evidence & our best guess is that the filthy little communist (Jackie's words) did it with the Mannlicher-Carcano in the Depository.Stone emptied the asylum on this one.  He built his bogus bs on Jim Marrs (sane, but a mercenary for the unhinged), Prouty, & the jolly green giant who easily ran over the Big Easy until a sober jury took about one hour to laugh him out of court.  Jim Garrison was an American monster.  He got headline news in the most fevered swamps (Ramparts Magazine) of the Left at a time when the Left's fevers were almost terminal.  He destroyed a good man, Clay Shaw, in a judicial conspiracy of emotional blackmail & emotional extortion.  Emotional rescue for New Orleans came only when Garrison took his bad case to court where the case collapsed, like Shaw, for whom rescue came too late.Stone should be ashamed of himself, but he's shameless, smirking all the way to his large-cap portfolio.  If he was going to make an Ed-Wood horror show, he should at least have hired a better man to play the lead, but hey, people bought their tickets & bought his septic-cesspool posturing anyway.

93411,AKP40TIE5SVSQ,0790729733,Some Gravity,"[4, 6]","Throughout its run of time,history,as we all know,has served both its very high points and its very low points. And,out of all of the very low points of history,one of those very low points continues to prove itself to be,by far,the assasination of John F. Kennedy. An assasination that left America in shame and grief with a lot of unanswered questions,people continue to ask unanswered questions about the JFK assasination--something that is resolved well throughout this film.This film is focused around not only around the assasination of John F. Kennedy and the controversy that aroused from the assasination and tore America apart,but also the investigation that New Orleans,LA lawyer/judge Jim Garrison (portrayed brilliantly by Kevin Costner in this film)launched for the assasination. In this film,not only does director Oliver Stone do a brilliant job at showing the obcession that Jim Garrison had with the assasination and solving the assasination,as well as how Garrison's investigation of the assasination kept Garrison apart from his family and the effect that it had on Garrison's marriage to his wife,Liz Garrison (Sissy Spacek). This film portrays both sides of the investigation--the lawyers and politicians who helped Jim Garrison investigate the assasination and how they helped Garrison through his investigation of the assasination,as well as their theories/opinions on the investigation,and the criminals who were happy that the assasination had happened and showed their hatred of President Kennedy,while they were willing to do and say anything to make sure that the investigation was not solved and remained a cover-up. These scenes are as fascinating as they are(mostly)informative,with good information and good chemistry between the actors. For example,in scenes that feauture the character of Jim Garrison with a character like David Ferrie (Joe Pesci)or a character like Willie O'Keefe (Kevin Bacon),good information on the assasination is brought into the conversations in the scene,while ideas about what could have caused the assasination are presented,as well. These scenes make this film as interesting as it is as a good film,with great chemistry in these scenes and great performances. These scenes are good additions in this movie alongside the other theories/facts from the assasination (what lead to Lee Harvey Oswald commiting the assasination,the problems that Jack Ruby's assasination of Oswald caused for the case and the things that happened to Ruby's life out of it,among others)which are fit into this film quite well and do a good job at carrying this film on until its very end,when you are given a depiction of the trial that Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones)faced and not only what got Shaw on trial,but also how Jim Garrison was able to answer some of the unanswered questions about the JFK assasination,and,of course,who murdered Kennedy and why Kennedy was murdered (with all of this being said,it is worth noting that President Lyndon B. Johnson's Warren Commision stated that Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone gunman and that the assasination was not part of a conspiracy,but that several people question the accuracy and honesty of that statement to this very day).Overall,an interesting and good film that does a great job at answering the unanswered questions of the John F. Kennedy assasination,and provides a possible theory with the issues and questions of who was involved with the assasination and why the assasination was committed. This film is VERY long (three hours--just a word of warning to those of you who do NOT like sitting through long movies),but is well lead and followed by Oliver Stone to make itself worth its running time. Kevin Costner is brilliant as Jim Garrison and allows viewers to take a walk through the mind of Mr. Garrison himself with Costner's portayal as Garrison,which shows who Garrison was as a person and how his personality was a large part of the assasination,with a good cast of supporting actors (Gary Oldman,John Candy,Brian-Doyle Murray,among several others) who bring richly executed performances to the screen and help the film come to life,with a good understanding of their character brought into their performance,at the same time.

Reality must always take precedence over ""Official Reports"" or Celebrity Endorsed Statements, and that's what I learned from JFK.  I think it is an ASTOUNDING achievement of cinematography, script, editing, and direction.  The people of superior intelligence and talent who brought all the crucial elements of this true story and film making together at the level witnessed in ""JFK"" have my highest admiration and regards.  This film is an absolute Must-See for an intelligent, enquiring mind.Now, for some of my own personal ""paranoia"".  There are good persons and there are bad people.  The good persons mind their own business, the bad people try to sell the undecided people the idea that the reason they are doing something bad in a bad way with bad results is for good reasons and a sublime outcome.  Bad people like crucifixions.  They'll stage them.  And they'll stage crucifixions to create a panic, a riot, a fear, an emotional response from a controllable MOB, a mass of people to aim and fire at whatever target they need to benefit their rise to power.The Warren Commission told the American People it was a madman who committed the Kennedy atrocity, and there was no hyper-hysteria aimed at the people of America that could be Communists, the Mafia, or alleged bigots.  The American People had been defused.  That was the only purpose of the Warren Report.  Now, the defusers are not necessarily the culprits.  The culprits are the ones who wanted chaos in America and race riots and protests (and even suspicion).  The Communists came to power in Russia out of the chaos, political turmoil, and starvation of World War 1.  I also believe they intended to come to power here out of the chaos of assassinations, Vietnam, race-relations and unionism.  The liberalism we experience today is the American Way of avoiding all that.If we can have crooked Intelligence Officers even as we speak,  in all powerful nations of the globe claiming there are WMDs in Iraq when there weren't any, making Iraq and Saddam out as more powerful than they actually were, hoping to give them more bargaining power when dealing with the U.S., don't you think this same evil element could have existed during the height of the Cold War, that we can have crooked intelligence officers in the 60's with ties to the MOB, the Mafia, the clergy, putting together not one but several assassinations of politically popular figures to go along with an unpopular war, left-educated, doped up college goons and their Marxist ideologies and their Manson-like families of stoned-out flower children.That the good persons of this nation over came this attack is amazing and speaks of a silent and great group of men who have served us and are not getting the congratulations and adulations they deserve for vanquishing the bad people...repeatedly.  We can't even begin to understand all this until we understand that there are two sides to the equation for all political issues:  Reason vs Faith, Capitalism vs Socialism, and Individualism vs Collectivism.  Reason, Capitalism and Individualism is the good side.(Please read Ayn Rand).If we were all programmed by our religions and social beliefs to react with a politically correct emotional response anytime the right piano keys were played at the right time, what would happen if the right keys were tinkled the wrong way at the wrong time, is it possible that the bad people who knew our programming could take control away from our elected leaders out of the chaos created by our unrestrained emotions (like Nixon)?  Due to the emotional health and obvious intelligence of the current ""good-persons"" of America, the answer is ""NOT"".The good persons of America are showing themselves resistant to programming.

However, to think Oswald was the lone gunman in the Kennedy assassination is being very nave. Not even the best marksman with far superior weapons could get off the number of shots Oswald supposedly did in that amount of time using a bolt action rifle, let alone score two head shots ( one in the throat and the other in the head). But I do not want to concentrate on that point but the movie. The acting was superb from all the actors which included: John Candy, Tommy Lee Jones, Joe Pesci, Kevin Bacon, and of  course Kevin Costner. This is a must see movie that will appeal to a broad audience. Even though it runs for approximately 3   hours it keeps you fixated to the screen. The video transfer to DVD was superb and the 5.1 Dolby was quite good., I would have liked to see the rear channels utilized a bit more but the subwoofer, main speakers, and center channel were will utilized. Dialog is focused on the center channel and is easy to hear even at low volume settings.

Kennedy was assassinated marking one of the most overwhelmingly saddening and pivotal events in American history. A man by the name of Lee Harvey Oswald was caught the very same day and charged with the murder of the president. The next day, Oswald was assassinated by former FBI agent Jack Ruby as he was leaving the facility he was being held in. The investigation has since frozen, and it was Oswald's name that has been linked to that of the president as the lone gunman who killed him.Less than 30 years later, controversial American filmmaker Oliver Stone reopened the JFK assassination files with this excellent movie that studies the assassination, and comes up with theories revolving around Oswald, and a plot to kill Kennedy that involved the CIA, FBI, Cuban exiles, Lyndon B. Johnson and many others. Now remember, it's all a matter of theory. But the theories presented in JFK are eye opening. How could Oswald shoot no less than 5 bullets in a mtter of 8 seconds and get the president from at least 3 different angles? (The magic bullet theory). What about the people who said that they heard shots coming from the picket fence right in front of the motorcade as it was passing by?JFK is an interesting movie with a star studded cast including Kevin Costner as District Attorney Jim Garrison, who takes us along on an inspiring investigation spree of who did what, and for what reasons, Sissy Spacek as his impatient wife, Tommy Lee Jones as Clay Shaw Bertrand, the man Garrison is trying to pin, Gary Oldman who does a brilliant job as Oswald, and many others including Kevin Bacon, Joe Pesci, John Candy, Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Brian Doyle-Murray, Donald Sutherland, and Michael Rooker.One of the best movies ever made!RecommendedA+",5,"""Don't forget...your dying king""",1135814400,"12 29, 2005",2005,1809,"['was', 'November', '22', '1963', 'day', 'US', 'president', 'John', 'F.', 'Kennedy', 'was', 'assassinated', 'marking', 'one', 'most', 'overwhelmingly', 'saddening', 'pivotal', 'events', 'American', 'history', 'man', 'name', 'Lee', 'Harvey', 'Oswald', 'was', 'caught', 'very', 'same', 'day', 'charged', 'murder', 'president', 'next', 'day', 'Oswald', 'was', 'assassinated', 'former', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Jack', 'Ruby', 'was', 'leaving', 'facility', 'was', 'being', 'held', 'investigation', 'frozen', 'was', 'Oswald', 'name', 'been', 'linked', 'president', 'lone', 'gunman', 'who', 'killed', 'him.Less', '30', 'years', 'later', 'controversial', 'American', 'filmmaker', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'reopened', 'JFK', 'assassination', 'files', 'excellent', 'movie', 'studies', 'assassination', 'up', 'theories', 'revolving', 'around', 'Oswald', 'plot', 'kill', 'Kennedy', 'involved', 'CIA', 'FBI', 'Cuban', 'Lyndon', 'B.', 'Johnson', 'many', 'others', 'Now', 'remember', 'matter', 'theory', 'theories', 'presented', 'JFK', 'are', 'eye', 'opening', 'How', 'could', 'Oswald', 'shoot', 'less', '5', 'bullets', 'mtter', '8', 'seconds', 'get', 'president', 'least', '3', 'different', 'angles', 'magic', 'bullet', 'theory', 'What', 'people', 'who', 'said', 'heard', 'shots', 'coming', 'picket', 'fence', 'right', 'front', 'motorcade', 'was', 'passing', 'JFK', 'interesting', 'movie', 'star', 'studded', 'cast', 'including', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'District', 'Attorney', 'Jim', 'Garrison', 'who', 'along', 'inspiring', 'investigation', 'spree', 'who', 'did', 'what', 'what', 'reasons', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'impatient', 'wife', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'Clay', 'Shaw', 'Bertrand', 'man', 'Garrison', 'trying', 'pin', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'who', 'brilliant', 'job', 'Oswald', 'many', 'others', 'including', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'Joe', 'Pesci', 'John', 'Candy', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'Walter', 'Matthau', 'Brian', 'Doyle-Murray', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'Michael', 'Rooker.One', 'best', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'RecommendedA+']",JFK Director's Cut

Perhaps, but more importantly he has used his artistic liscence to put a  twist (Oliver's Twist) on what really happened that tragic day in Dallas.

After the shameful whitewash attempt by author Gerald Posner, 'Case Closed' (gotta love his arrogance) JFK is like a breath of fresh air.Personally, I didn't like or trust Kennedy, so I don't have a political axe to grind by aligning myself with the Pro-Conspiracy side. It's just that there is enough questionable data to make any reasonable person doubt the official explanations.Gerald Posner's utterly laughable 'explanation' of the second shot as being a reflex action, in which JFK's head suddenly jerked backwards, is all you need to hear to know that the level of intelligence of the anti-Conspiracy side is enough to give Homer Simpson a superiority complex.Olly Stone has got so much right here that the actual fine detail is almost irrelevant.

It is a powerful film that is filled with intriguing characters played by an exceptional cast. The storyline fills the plot out rather nicely, and the courtroom scenes are intense and emotionally-charged.Now to the theories the film presents. The Zapruder film makes it plainly obvious that the shot that killed Kennedy did NOT come from the Book Depository, but from the Grassy Knoll. The questions surrounding the assassination, and the questions about a possible cover-up, are presented quite well in this film. The film also presents a theory that is scary to contemplate, but still feasible: the only successful coup d'etat on American soil. The evidence for the conspiracy theories are presented accurately and faithfully.The only segments I disagree with are the theories about Oswald. I still believe he fired shots from the Depository, and two of the bullets he fired hit Kennedy, but I do believe that he became the scapegoat for the conspiracy plot. Other than this little blunder, the rest of the case is presented real well in the film.The bonus DVD features an exceptional documentary that goes beyond the film to discuss the many theories surrounding their deaths, as well as an interview with Fletcher Prouty. The deleted scenes present little good, and are a weak part of the second disc.

93421,A3ODVVP9XO42L,0790729733,Steven R. Travers,"[2, 9]","What really has set the Left back is not just the failure of this film medium to accomplish their goals, but also the lack of faith accorded college professors, school textbooks, and mainstream news. So who is left to tell the real story?Weeeeeell, my friends, we are out there. We have been waiting in the wings all these years, gathering the facts in silence, not showing our hand, waiting for judgment day. The day of reckoning is upon us. Let freedom reign.As for ""JFK"", it is a complicated piece of fiction that would require some real research to effectively discredit all of its lies. What it did in the theatre was have one asking, ""Jeez, did that really happen?"" or ""My God, is this true?"" or ""Holy cow, I can't believe this could be."" It is major sensory overload. Innocent civilians who knew things are killed. Deception and murder are used to cover up the sordid deeds. The film requires several viewings, and frankly time, probably years, to unravel it. What happens is that various reviews, reports from historical figures and historians are read and pieced together. After a while the discovery is made that a particular ""witness"" never existed, a certain ""police officer"" is a figment of Stone's imagination, smoke in the trees, conversations, special ops guys with the inside scoop (particular ""Major X"" played by Canadian Donald Sutherland) are invented out of whole cloth. A proposition is one thing, but ""JFK"" is ""Alice in Wonderland"", a ""riddle wrapped inside an enigma, tied by a puzzle"" or whatever it is Joe Pesci says. It is exhausting.So who killed JFK? Oh, maaaaan! Stone's answer, as best I can tell, was Lyndon Johnson, in league with the joint chiefs, because Kennedy wanted out of Vietnam and they wanted in (because American industry needed the war?), working with right wing Birchers, who were part of rogue elements of the CIA (?), who were a ""track,"" whatever that is, that could not be stopped because it was an inexorable connection starting in Guatemala (""good""), Iran (""good""), and Bay of Pigs (""not so good""), that had become dominated by Cuban exile ""Republicans,"" working in league with the Soviets (KGB?), who recruited Lee Harvey Oswald, who learned to shoot in the Marines, who lived and married in Russia then came back, who promoted Marxism but was funded by Birchers (?), who was a patsy for the Dallas Mafia, who had Oswald-lookalikes say incriminating things, who worked with JFK, who worked with La Casa Nostra (who turned on him?), who were tied to Naval Intelligence (?), who operated out of a corner in New Orleans in which the Feds, the NIS and somebody else all had offices, who were tied to right wing homosexual businessmen, defrocked priests, gay prostitutes and guys with tempers like Ed Asner, whose activities were known by corrupt New Orleans lawyers and politicians, who were in league with the New Orleans International Trade Mart or something like that, protected by Dallas strip club owners, who hatched a plan that involved Cubans training in the Florida swamps or Latin America by gay militia commandos, who bought a bad Italian rifle with a bolt action release via mail instead of purchasing a better weapon through the black market or a store, who gave it to Oswald, who may or may not have fired at JFK but could not possibly have hit his mark from the Texas Book Depository, who with Secret Service agents working to kill the President had assassins disguised as police officers and bums in the bushes, a car wreck lot and a grassy knoll, and created a triangulated cross-fire that killed the President then got away.Now, friends and neighbors, after all of that, at no time does Mr. Stone suggest that the assassination was the work of a fellow he later visited and said was a great man, named Fidel Castro, who is the most likely suspect.Res ipsa loquiter.Castro and the mob? Maybe. The confusion of Stone's plot twists is highly, precisely and to quintessential effect that with which the real killers want. Stone's film vastly hurts the attempt to learn the truth. He raises plenty of legitimate questions, mainly regarding the so-called ""magic bullet,"" and he operates on at least one fairly solid foundation, which is that the Zapruder film seems to show more than one shooter. Saying Oswald was not a lone gunman is a premise I can give credence to, but beyond that God knows.One thing is puzzling, and that is that in all the years since nobody has ""stepped forward."" Every so often somebody shows up on Larry King Live and says his father, usually a ""Dallas cop,"" was the shooter, but these stories always have the crackpot feel to them. I want a deathbed confession from a Cuban, one of Sam Giancana's guys, something solid. When all the smoke clears, you still have a Communist sympathizer, Oswald, killing a President who just humiliated Kruschev over the Bay of Pigs, is a threat to Castro and is building up troops to fight Commies in Vietnam. It is plausible he had help and they were on the Grassy Knoll, they got away and Jack Ruby killed Oswald to shut him up. Maybe a little too convenient. The Warren Commission report came out only one year later, not enough time to sort out everything. The Church hearings were too open to get the real stuff beyond salacious sex. Secret CIA/FBI investigations might have been the only real answer, and who knows, maybe they were conducted, and maybe the gullible public cannot handle the truth. Who knows?

93423,A3U56M0Y8LYO6J,0790729733,"Steven Y. ""Pop Culture Addict""","[2, 2]","Oliver's Stone's ""JFK"" is one of those lightning-rod films.  Immediate controversy was stirred up by its questionable accuracy and its seemingly outrageous claims.  However, one must remember that this is a feature film from a Hollywood studio and not a documentary objectively examining its subject.  ""Historical"" films are notorious for ""fudging"" the truth in order to maximize its dramatic impact and ""JFK"" is no different.  The film does stack the deck by leading its viewers to draw only one possible conclusion - that the official inquiry into JFK's assassination was part of a conspiracy - but should the film be penalized for its one-sidedness?  The answer is no.  ""JFK"" is meant to be art and makes no claims to be 100% accurate or objective.  It is a fictional interpretation of a traumatic historical event with elements of the real-life event included in its narrative.  It is a story about the possible circumstances surrounding JFK's assassination and not a story of what actually happened.  On that level, the film is a masterpiece.""JFK"" stars Kevin Costner as Jim Garrison, a man obsessed with getting to the bottom of the Kennedy assassination.  Through his investigation, he becomes convinced that Lee Harvey Oswald (Gary Oldman) did not act alone in killing Kennedy? The physical evidence cited in the Warren Commission report just does not support the claim of a lone gunman.  Something is amiss but what exactly?  Does businessman Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones) have the key to unlocking the entire investigation?  So many questions but unfortunately so little answers.  In the end, the holes in the story are never filled and the mystery of what really happened in Dallas on November 22, 1963 survives to haunt the nation for another day.Stone never does try to solve the ""JFK"" mystery once and for all.  He merely puts forth his own personal interpretation of events and the technique he employs in dispensing his evidence is a technical triumph of editing.  Documentary and newly-shot footage are weaved together with flashback sequences to create a mesmerizing chronicle of what Stone thinks happened.  Costner is dazzling in his portrayal of Garrison.  Those filmgoers jaded by Costner's lack of recent quality performance should revisit ""JFK"" to remind themselves of just how much talent Costner does possess.  The supporting cast is made up of an honor roll of screen legends past and present.

Stone comes from  the 'throw-it-all-at-them' school of conspiracy theories, where he's completely unconcerned whether all of his facts are correct, fit together, or even contradict each other; he just wants you to accept something, anything.He had been a hero to me before this film, with 'Salvador', 'Platoon', and 'Wall Street', but he lost me completely and forever with this cynical pack of lies. He surely knew that much of what he was putting out here was false but did it anyway. An absolute disgrace.To go through all the evidence here is, naturally, impossible, but perhaps one typical example wouldn't go amiss: Stone calls Oswald a good American, just trying to live a good life. Here's the truth, well-established and documented. Oswald bought the rifle and was even photographed with it, photos verified by top experts.  He used the rifle to try and kill General Edwin Walker 6 months before, a fact verified by forensics and by the testimony of Marina, to whom he admitted it. On the night before the assassination he stayed with Marina (they were separated), breaking what had been his habit (he generally only stayed on weekends), because he had to pick up the rifle which was kept in the garage. He took it with him, in the guise of 'curtain rods' wrapped in paper (what a phenomenal coincidence, to have taken something the same shape and length as a rifle to work the day of the assassination!!), to work the next day. That morning he left his wedding ring and almost all of his money with Marina (what a coincidence, to have done this on the day of the assassination!). Then, after the assassination, he abruptly left without speaking to anyone, rushed home to grab a pistol, left immediately, entered a cinema without paying (I'm skipping the murder of the policeman, assuming him a ""good citizen"")then fought a policeman who approached him, even pulling the trigger, which didn't fire. All of this is fact and well-documented by unimpeachable sources. Does this sound like the actions of an innocent man to you, as Stone would have it? What a joke!!!If you must see this thing then enjoy it as drama, taking the rest with a grain of salt.

The lighting, the quality of footage, the costumes, down to the very innocent yet nave nature of the American public.Gradually as Garrison unravels the case, the situation gets ugly and then uglier, unveiling the true intention behind the death of JFK.  Garrison is confided in by many, telling him the facts of what they saw that day, evidence that was not only ignored but altered by the Warren Commission.  People begin to turn on him, including his wife.  This part of the story in particular demonstrates how difficult it was for Garrison, that even though his facts all lined up and the people knew about them, no one wanted to confront the horror of what this meant about our countries' leaders.Stone illuminates details about the war industry, and the policies that JFK wanted to enforce.

The cast is good and, to be such a long film, it holds together.But in the years since then, a lot more has come out about the Kennedy assassination--and Stone's film.I just watched a show on the History Channel last night that completely destroys this movie's entire conspiracy theory.  It WAS possible for Oswald to get off three shots from 88 yards (and an 89-year-old man did it nearly a dozen times to demonstrate it); the fatal head shot DID come from behind the president (as shown in the autopsy); the ""magic bullet"" DID create the wounds in Kennedy and Governor Connally without turning or ""hanging in the air"" (a computer recreation showed how everyone was sitting for that to happen).Can these things still be argued?  I believe that anyone looking at all the data available now would have a hard time doing so.  But I know they will.  There's a paranoid guy at work who's passing out cheaply-made ""documentaries"" of what REALLY happened on 9-11, so crazy theories about everything will always be around.It was also disappointing to find out that Jim Garrison, the crusading attorney played Kevin Costner, was revised by Stone for his movie--and that Stone completely embellished his final speech in the film.

I'd love to tell you I was the second gunman on the grassy knoll, AND give you ALL irrefutable proof that it's the God's honest truth, but who would believe me?  Anyone who cares has already made up their mind.  What would it take (REALLY!) to get you to change your mind?  Have any of you ever thought about that???

How can you believe anyone at this point?  There's enough information out there to build a case for (practically) any theory you want.  I want the fu@#ing truth!!!  I can't believe that after this much time has passed that we still aren't any closer than we were in 1964.  The Warren Commission's investigation was a joke.

LBJ gets the limo cleaned and the interior replaced (BEFORE it can be inspected and photographed--HE DESTROYED EVIDENCE!!!), and nothing is done!!!

ALL the Dallas doctors said that the wounds clearly showed the shots came FROM THE FRONT,  but we're supposed to believe that they ALL MADE A MISTAKE and the monopoly on autopsy wisdom resides with the doctors at Bethesda???  A pathologist is 'chosen' to lead the autopsy who had NO (AUTOPSY) EXPERIENCE WITH VICTIMS OF GUNSHOT WOUNDS, and NO ONE DOES OR SAYS ANYTHING!!!  How the hell does something as important as the BRAIN get ""lost""???  All this and more makes it obvious (to me) that there is no simple explanation for what happened.  Military/Industrial complex?  Cuba/Castro?  The Mob?  The CIA?  How 'bout the Secret Service?  Russia/KGB?  Oswald plus others?  How the hell are we supposed to know???

This, of course, is the same mainstream media that attacked Stone's film with a blind fury and savagery not directed at any other motion picture to my knowledge.JFK is extremely well-made: the directing, editing and cinematography are perfect.

93439,A2ZR5EUYPX69CB,0790729733,T. Mark,"[4, 4]","The movie JFK is in effect a who-done-it without telling you who-done-it. Oliver Stone gives us the story of New Orleans DA Jim Garrison in his quest to convict businessman Clay Shaw of conspriacy to assassinate President  John F. Kennedy in Dallas. However, Garrison's case against Shaw was never  strong. Truth be told, I myself am not a believer that Mr. Shaw had  anything to do with President Kennedy's death on November 22, 1963. With  that said, there are other factors in this motion picture which do offer  more than a few redeemable gems. Lee Oswald's very dubious movements in  Russia, New Orleans, and Mexico for one. The hostility of the CIA toward  the Kennedy White House, and the Agency's involement with the Mafia to  assassinate Cuba's Castro. The highly implausible saga of the Single Bullet  Theory. And the strange behavior of the Dr. Humes for burning the original  autopsy draft. Factors such as this, to name a few, have put a great strain  on the Warren Report's conclusion that Oswald did it- and did it alone.  Criticisms towards the Report have been around for years prior to the movie  JFK. Yet it was this movie that brought these critical factors to the  national stage and a new generation. History NEED NOT say JFK be the  definative word for the  killing of John Kennedy.  But the Warren Report  CAN'T make that claim either. The Government went into the investigation of  President Kennedy's death with a preconceived notion that Oswald was to be  blamed, and the presentation of evidence was to show that end-and that end  alone. The Comission was bullied by the Johnson White House to finish the  investigation before the 64 election. The &quot;autopsy&quot; the Comission  used to prove it's case was a shambles. The CIA's deception to the  Comission on assassination plots with the Mafia on Fidel Castro only adds  to the Warren Report's investigative impotence. True, Oliver Stone's movie  is a mixture of fact and fiction, that is clear. However, it does  illustrate key facts to the case which the Warren Comission failed-or  refused-to cover. That by itself makes this movie worthy of the four stars  I give it. But proceed with caution, dear reader: Be aware that this film,  like so many people's take on the death of John Kennedy, is a blend of  history and opinion.

Stone succeeded wildly in technically innovating his way to a new kind of cinema verite. The problem is, of course, JFK's just a movie, but the people it depicted (mostly) existed.  That immediately opens up Stone's directorial tour-de-force to criticism on grounds of accuracy.  There, it languishes in ambiguity and doubt.Though Garrison only barely lived to see the film released, his colleagues at the time have since given interviews in which they described the characterizations of Ferry, Shaw and other principles as unfamiliar.  As another reviewer has pointed out, no mention is really made of Shaw's meritorious military service in World War II, nor is Garrison's characterization of Shaw as a ""CIA operative"" really challenged (he was never on the CIA payroll).  Likewise, the film fails to directly explore what happened to Garrison in later life, and how his theories about the assassination kept getting broader and less fact-based.  There's no discussion of the allegations of bought witnesses, flimsy evidence, or corruption which swirled around Garrison at later stages of his investigation, and which ultimately helped to lose him a re-election bid.  Garrison is merely portrayed as a quixotic hero tilting at government windmills.And indeed maybe he was.  Maybe the loss of David Ferrie (his star witness) was so devastating to his case that he tried to put it back together again, using flimsier evidence.  Maybe he really had a case and it just evaporated.  Or maybe, like some members of the Lousiana press were reporting at the time, he had nothing.JFK does little to settle the debate surrounding Jim Garrison.  If anything- and maybe this was Stone's point all along--it's just deepened it.  That escalating debate is mirrored in the emotions evoked by the film itself.At its worst, JFK is seen to be dangerous, fact-starved propoganda.  Some have found it easy to compare Stone to the acclaimed German director, Leni Riefenstahl, whose stunning art glorified Hitler's regime at the expense of literal truth.At its best, Stone's vision is a dramatization of a few branches of the assassination story unknown to most Americans.  Prior to this film, many were unaware that there had been any sort of court case at all connected with the assassination, and that it might have led to a conviction, had Garrison been able to provide better witnesses.  It can be claimed that the many inaccuracies in the film are no more egregious than what generally happens in many historical dramas.Whatever faults there are in the facts on display, though, there is actual history in Oliver Stone's film.  It's just not the history of the assassination, or even an entirely accurate record of Garrison's investigation.  Rather, JFK's strength is in dramatizing some of the main conspiracy theories.  And if viewed as more allegory than fact--if Costner's Garrison is seen as a theatrical lens through which to view the various strands of conspiracy theory that have long floated around the assassination--then it works less problematically than if you try to see it as a definitive history of anything that happened in Lousiana or Texas in the 1960s.Fifty years from now, JFK will likely be seen as an accurate history of the way the assassination made people feel.  The assassination was the start of anger and rebellion against the government in America.  And, whatever its other faults, JFK shows why.  Even if many of the events in JFK aren't literally true, and real people take an unjustified beating in Stone's harsh light, Stone isn't exactly making it up.  He's putting on the screen the questions that so many Americans had then, and certainly continue to ask.  He doesn't arrive at his conclusions through meticulous academic research; Stone assumes, perhaps to his detriment, that Garrison and Marrs have already done his homework for him.  No, JFK Is history by reflection.  Stone has put a giant mirror in front of the American people and asked whether we like what we see.[DVD Notes: Don't even bother with any other version but the new Director's cut.  Neither DVD version has any significant additional featres, but at least the Director's cut has 17 more minutes of footage.  It's very frustrating that the DVDs are so devoid of extra features, because there's so much that could have been included.  The only reason I'm taking a star away from this product is because of the inexplicably missing bonus material.]",4,Don't watch this movie uncritically,974764800,"11 21, 2000",2000,4623,"['JFK', 'brilliant', 'filmmaking', 'Innovative', 'use', 'period', 'stock', 'timeline', 'distortion', 'flashbacks', 'great', 'acting', 'combine', 'immerse', 'viewer', 'world', 'decidedly', 'real', 'Stone', 'succeeded', 'wildly', 'technically', 'innovating', 'way', 'new', 'kind', 'cinema', 'verite', 'problem', 'course', 'JFK', 'just', 'movie', 'people', 'depicted', 'mostly', 'existed', 'immediately', 'up', 'Stone', 'directorial', 'tour-de-force', 'criticism', 'grounds', 'accuracy', 'ambiguity', 'doubt.Though', 'Garrison', 'only', 'barely', 'lived', 'see', 'film', 'released', 'colleagues', 'time', 'have', 'given', 'interviews', 'described', 'characterizations', 'Ferry', 'Shaw', 'other', 'principles', 'unfamiliar', 'reviewer', 'pointed', 'out', 'mention', 'really', 'made', 'Shaw', 'meritorious', 'military', 'service', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Garrison', 'characterization', 'Shaw', 'CIA', 'operative', 'really', 'challenged', 'was', 'never', 'CIA', 'payroll', 'Likewise', 'film', 'directly', 'explore', 'what', 'happened', 'Garrison', 'later', 'life', 'how', 'theories', 'assassination', 'kept', 'getting', 'broader', 'less', 'fact-based', 'discussion', 'allegations', 'bought', 'witnesses', 'flimsy', 'evidence', 'corruption', 'swirled', 'Garrison', 'later', 'stages', 'investigation', 'ultimately', 'helped', 'lose', 're-election', 'bid', 'Garrison', 'merely', 'portrayed', 'quixotic', 'hero', 'tilting', 'government', 'windmills.And', 'indeed', 'maybe', 'was', 'Maybe', 'loss', 'David', 'Ferrie', 'star', 'witness', 'was', 'so', 'devastating', 'case', 'tried', 'put', 'back', 'together', 'again', 'using', 'flimsier', 'evidence', 'Maybe', 'really', 'had', 'case', 'just', 'evaporated', 'maybe', 'members', 'Lousiana', 'press', 'were', 'reporting', 'time', 'had', 'nothing.JFK', 'little', 'settle', 'debate', 'surrounding', 'Jim', 'Garrison', 'anything-', 'maybe', 'was', 'Stone', 'point', 'all', 'along', 'just', 'deepened', 'escalating', 'debate', 'mirrored', 'emotions', 'evoked', 'film', 'itself.At', 'worst', 'JFK', 'seen', 'be', 'dangerous', 'fact-starved', 'propoganda', 'have', 'found', 'easy', 'compare', 'Stone', 'acclaimed', 'German', 'director', 'Leni', 'Riefenstahl', 'stunning', 'art', 'glorified', 'Hitler', 'regime', 'expense', 'literal', 'truth.At', 'best', 'Stone', 'vision', 'dramatization', 'few', 'branches', 'assassination', 'story', 'unknown', 'most', 'Americans', 'Prior', 'film', 'many', 'were', 'unaware', 'had', 'been', 'sort', 'court', 'case', 'connected', 'assassination', 'might', 'have', 'led', 'conviction', 'had', 'Garrison', 'been', 'able', 'provide', 'better', 'witnesses', 'can', 'be', 'claimed', 'many', 'inaccuracies', 'film', 'are', 'more', 'egregious', 'what', 'generally', 'many', 'historical', 'dramas.Whatever', 'faults', 'are', 'facts', 'display', 'though', 'actual', 'history', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'film', 'just', 'not', 'history', 'assassination', 'even', 'entirely', 'accurate', 'record', 'Garrison', 'investigation', 'Rather', 'JFK', 'strength', 'dramatizing', 'main', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'viewed', 'more', 'allegory', 'fact', 'Costner', 'Garrison', 'seen', 'theatrical', 'lens', 'view', 'various', 'strands', 'conspiracy', 'theory', 'have', 'long', 'floated', 'assassination', 'then', 'less', 'problematically', 'try', 'see', 'definitive', 'history', 'anything', 'happened', 'Lousiana', 'Texas', '1960s.Fifty', 'years', 'now', 'JFK', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'seen', 'accurate', 'history', 'way', 'assassination', 'made', 'people', 'feel', 'assassination', 'was', 'start', 'anger', 'rebellion', 'government', 'America', 'other', 'faults', 'JFK', 'why', 'Even', 'many', 'events', 'JFK', 'are', ""n't"", 'literally', 'true', 'real', 'people', 'take', 'unjustified', 'beating', 'Stone', 'harsh', 'light', 'Stone', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'making', 'up', 'putting', 'screen', 'questions', 'so', 'many', 'Americans', 'had', 'then', 'certainly', 'continue', 'ask', ""n't"", 'arrive', 'conclusions', 'meticulous', 'academic', 'research', 'Stone', 'perhaps', 'detriment', 'Garrison', 'Marrs', 'have', 'already', 'done', 'homework', 'No', 'JFK', 'Is', 'history', 'reflection', 'Stone', 'put', 'giant', 'mirror', 'front', 'American', 'people', 'asked', 'like', 'what', 'see', '[', 'DVD', 'Notes', 'Do', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'other', 'version', 'new', 'Director', 'cut', 'DVD', 'version', 'significant', 'additional', 'featres', 'least', 'Director', 'cut', '17', 'more', 'minutes', 'footage', 'very', 'frustrating', 'DVDs', 'are', 'so', 'devoid', 'extra', 'features', 'so', 'much', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'included', 'only', 'reason', ""'m"", 'taking', 'star', 'away', 'product', 'inexplicably', 'missing', 'bonus', 'material', ']']",JFK Director's Cut

I have read many books about the case including excerpts from the Warren Commission report. I am not convinced by anything I have read or seen that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, nor am I convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that a conspiracy existed that resulted in a coup d'etat.While JFK spins a good story, there is nothing of substance to prove that a conspiracy existed. It is based on the story of a politician who, in my opinion, may have been seeking public acclaim to perpetuate his own career. The movie addresses many very questionable events that took place the day of the assassination and in the months and years following. But Oliver Stone fall short of making a conclusive argument. As the movie clearly shows, there are many facts that point to some kind of cover-up.

93452,A3ILFAT3HHYOXE,0790729733,widowedwalker,"[3, 6]","When Oliver Stone sat down to write and direct this picture, given that 95% of the data contained within was available in numerous books since the '60s and '70s, he must have expected the typically dismissive reaction those paperback treatises had largely received.Instead, all Hell broke loose.Not since the jaw-droppingly racist epic THE BIRTH OF A NATION seventy-six years earlier had a movie received such a startlingly prickly response or would become such a controversy.Based rather loosely on New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison's prosecution of local businessman Clay Shaw regarding Shaw's alleged complicity in setting up Lee Harvey Oswald in the 1963 JFK assassination (""loosely"" because the investigation and trial is used as a format for presenting data uncovered in some cases by other investigators and at a later date) the picture is a mesmerizingly rich montage of fact and educated theory, Stone's quick-cuts editing style then highly unusual (though now used incessantly in movies about absolutely nothing) and evocative. He does an impressive job of communicating a massive amount of information to the audience in only about three hours. But it's exactly Stone's cinematic skill which caused ""JFK"" to explode into reviled critical consciousness in a manner all those assassination books never would, could or did.Any honest student of the assassination won't be stunned by the content. But the media and governmental overreactive upsurge against the movie was almost more damning that the movie itself.Even today, nearly two decades after the film was released, it's astounding how infamous it remains. Also astounding is how the LoneNut/Oswald-did-it mindset continues to hold on. If one checks out the numerous assassination Internet websites, for example, they are nearly all stalwart defenders of the Warren Commission, some surfacely affecting objectivity, some rabidly direct --- they are essentially the cyber version of Gerald Posner's 1993 ""Case Closed"", once called ""the most dishonest book ever written"" and a literary response to Stone's movie. ""Case Closed"" (and those websites) clearly know the data: they go into great, intricate detail in an effort to meticulously deconstruct all of the pro-conspiracy material.... only they deconstruct falsely. As anyone who knows the material will quickly realize. But, to the uninitiated, such sites' endless, 24/7 ""debunking"" (a favorite phrase by the fervent and on-message-beyond-belief LoneNut bloggers who haunt the Internet) of the conspiracy can appear quite convincing, just as these more casual audiences are so easily fooled by the authoritative yet selectively sloppy Untruths of Peter Jennings' 40th Anniversary Special for ABC in 2003 or (that other Stone's) ""Oswald's Ghost.""The eternal rationalizations, the endless manipulations from the pro-Warren Commission crowd. The unending assertions of, ""Oh, I use to be a conspiracy believer, too, until I learned that.... ,"" and the ubiquitous world-weary faux tones of, ""Let's just finally get this behind us, people. If you would read the superb and painstaking investigation by ...... then, you would know that this was all concretely disproved years ago when.....""On and on and on.Apparently, the only massive conspiracy this seething, vitriolic army of LoneNutters finds credible is that countless otherwise unconnected witnesses --- even those first-hand witnesses from Dealey Plaza! --- all somehow colluded in their shameless efforts to clear Oswald, frame the CIA, or just to frame faceless gunman in the trees behind the picket fence. All for money or attention or to achieve some other unspecified spineless agendum.At this late date, however, with nearly all of the conspirators presumably long gone (and ~75% of the American public still convinced of the conspiracy, as they have been since the '60s) why is maintaining The Lie so important in some corners? As clearly it is. It has, after all, been nearly half a century since Kennedy died on the streets of Dallas.Perhaps because the dynamic behind the assassination of the 35th president (or the dynamic behind misrepresenting it) is still essentially in place. 'The Secret State' is an awfully mysterious phrase, but it simply reflects large corporate business interests and those interests' determined defense of their rights to circumvent our democratic processes at every possible turn... Up until the recent near-Depressional economic downturn, the national news media (generally in bed with the same corporations) wouldn't even fleetingly address arguably the most pressing issue of our time: corporate corruption and Big Business's stranglehold on all levels of our government. And even now, such coverage is superficial and grudging at best.So when famed Watergate burglar E Howard Hunt's 2004 handwritten and audio-taped confession of personal and CIA/LBJ involvement in JFK's murder can't even receive coverage in the national media decades after the event, where are we still?It seems there is no pro-conspiracy revelation, no matter how dramatic and credible, which can receive coverage. And no anti-conspiracy evidence, no matter how flimsy and contrived, which can't.Many detractors have sneered that it's dreadful that millions of youngsters perceive the JFK assassination thru the ""distorted lens"" of Oliver Stone.

This modern classic is not in any terms a normal historical drama, nor is it a drama in any normal sense. Oliver Stone has certainly created a piece of art here, something so grand that no matter how many viewings of this great picture, you will most certainly discover an unseen treasure that you missed the last time you watched it. The incredible oscar winning editing and wonderful cinematography of this relic will keep you intrenched into this incredible film the whole way through. The deeper one gets into this film, the stronger and more potent it becomes. Every actor in this film is incredible, reflecting a past reality so well, that at many times one forgets that this is actually a movie. For example, the scenes of the Kennedy autopsy are so dark and disturbing, but at the same time so intriguing that one cannot help but keep such images inside ones memory. Like a great movie JFK is a film that will remain with you always, and a film that keeps you wanting to see it again and keep asking questions about the greatest unsolved murder in our history.",5,JFK......what a masterpiece!,1317859200,"10 6, 2011",2011,1130,"['How', 'one', 'put', 'particular', 'film', 'certain', 'genre', 'modern', 'classic', 'not', 'terms', 'normal', 'historical', 'drama', 'drama', 'normal', 'sense', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'certainly', 'created', 'piece', 'art', 'here', 'something', 'so', 'grand', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'viewings', 'great', 'picture', 'will', 'most', 'certainly', 'discover', 'unseen', 'treasure', 'missed', 'last', 'time', 'watched', 'incredible', 'oscar', 'winning', 'editing', 'wonderful', 'cinematography', 'relic', 'will', 'keep', 'intrenched', 'incredible', 'film', 'whole', 'way', 'deeper', 'one', 'film', 'stronger', 'more', 'potent', 'actor', 'film', 'incredible', 'reflecting', 'past', 'reality', 'so', 'well', 'many', 'times', 'one', 'actually', 'movie', 'example', 'scenes', 'Kennedy', 'autopsy', 'are', 'so', 'dark', 'disturbing', 'same', 'time', 'intriguing', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'keep', 'such', 'images', 'ones', 'memory', 'great', 'movie', 'JFK', 'film', 'will', 'remain', 'always', 'film', 'wanting', 'see', 'again', 'keep', 'asking', 'questions', 'greatest', 'unsolved', 'murder', 'history']",JFK Director's Cut
93454,A35PRTXTXU9EZF,0790729733,William T. Parnell,"[3, 4]","This new DVD Special Edition of Oliver Stone's JFK adds several new features to the classic political thriller.First is commentary by Stone himself, which runs the gamut from fascinating behind the scenes glimpses to self-serving and intentionally misleading propaganda. Stone, to his credit, does correct a few inaccuracies including the ""three tramps"" contention which he now admits is bogus. He is occasionally defensive and refers frequently to critics of the film sometimes in a derogatory fashion.A second addition to the disc is the deleted and extended scenes. Three of these stand out-a meeting between Garrison and ""Mr. Miller"" (a personification of the military-industrial complex or secret government, which ever you prefer), a scene where the ghost of Oswald speaks, and an alternate ending again featuring ""Mr. X"". Most of the other scenes are mere extensions or scenes rightfully deleted.Rounding out the special features are two ""multimedia essays"". The first is a segment on documents released by the ARRB presented by Jim DiEugenio. The other is an interview with Fletcher Prouty, the inspiration for the film's ""Mr. X"". The essays will probably not enlighten those familiar with either gentleman, but newcomers may find them useful.If you have yet to purchase JFK on DVD now is the time to do so.

93458,AY8WZDYR79GFV,0790729733,Yasha Banana,"[6, 37]","Dear Oliver Stone,JFK got shot?  You're kidding!  Is he all right?(Geez, you miss the news one lousy day and you're out of touch.)Seriously though, I, Yasha J. Banana -- at 96 years-old, the oldest living Amazon movie reviewer (if you call this living) -- personally, I didn't care for the flicker.Not enough sex.Okay, so it was about the murder of JFK.  I realize that, Oliver.  But what about all those groovy cheerleaders who were in ""On Any Given Sunday""?  A couple of them couldn't have played the doctors who did the autopsy?  Or maybe one of them could have played the hooker JFK had sex with the night before.Not many people know this but I, Yasha J. Banana -- nonagenarian, hat blocker and one-time delicatessen manager in Mooseballs, Texas -- I almost got a part in ""JFK.""Oh yeah!Your assistant director wanted me to audition for one of the bullets.  But I said, ""Listen, boychick, let's face it, I'm not as fast as I used to be.  Besides, I'm a Democrat.""Meanwhile, where was Jackie Kennedy in this movie?  You know, the wife.  After all, she saw the whole thing, didn't she?  And yet there wasn't a part for her in the  entire movie?  How come?  What, there weren't any shiksa actresses available at the time?Nothing personal, Oliver, and don't take this the wrong way but if it was up to me, I'd go against type and cast Joan Rivers as Jackie Kennedy.Joan Rivers, Jackie Kennedy -- could those gals shop!  But Joan has Jackie beat by a mile.  Reminds me of my fourth wife.  One time she lost her credit card.  But I didn't report it -- why should I -- the person who stole it bought less than she did.  (~Ba-da bing-bing!~)And Kevin Costner as Jim Garrison.  A nice Gentile fellow; but, honestly, not my cup of tea; I would have preferred Henny Youngman in the role.  (""Take my case, please!"")Here's Jim Garrison, a beleagured district attorney with a nearly impossible case to prove, and what do you do, Oliver, you get Kevin Costner, a goyische cup, to play the part.  Putz!If Henny Youngman wasn't available you could have hired *my* lawyer to play the part.  Belongs to a big law firm, ""Ganef, Ganef, Ganef and Aquinas.""  Owns his own ambulance.  (Ba-da bing-bang-bing!)Meanwhile, what about Jack Ruby, there's another brainstorm of yours.  You get Brian-Doyle Murray, an Irishman, to play the part!  *Jan* Murray would have been more like it.Oliver, my boy, what were you thinking -- Jack Ruby was Jewish, not Irish.  What was the casting of this movie, restricted?The only intriguing part of the movie for me was the scene where John Candy is eating in a restaurant.  I'm thinking to myself: did the guy who owned this restaurant take in a partner? -- the place was packed! it looked like it was a gold mine!Oy, the money I could have made in Mooseballs, Texas with my ""GENTILES WELCOME"" concept delicatessan.If only my ""Sheep Dip Surprise"" had caught on.  But who knew?Anyway, call me sentimental but I felt sorry for that skinny little guy, what's his name, Leo Harvey Oswinkle.  The poor schnook.Hunted, arrested, taken into custody and questioned, and what? not one policeman gave him a cup coffee, a piece pie?  Okay, so they could have gotten it from the store, but he had to eat, didn't he?Where's the realism, Oliver Stone?  Where's the versimilitude?  All those newsmen questioning Leon Harvey Oswinkle and not one of them gave him a cookie or an orange to nosh on?  I doubt it.Okay, Jack Ruby shot Lee Harvey Oswald and Jack Ruby was Jewish.  This we know.  He changed his name from Rubenstein to Ruby.  This is an historic fact; and far be it from me, Yasha J. Banana, to suggest that your movie be intentionally inaccurate (ahem!) but what?, you couldn't have changed Jack Ruby's name to Art Linkletter?  Or, better yet, Jack Armstrong.  You know, blame it on the goyim for a change.Either that or else make Jack Ruby a nebbish, a Woody Allen type.  So that instead of shooting the gun, he drops it.  Big deal, so you change the story around a little bit.  You changed so much, you couldn't have done that?Historic license!  That's it, that's the ticket, my boy!You've already got everybody and their brother-in-law in on the plot to kill JFK, so you take a little more license, what's it gonna hurt?  What's JFK gonna do, rise from the dead and sue you, serve you a paper?Ahhh! but why cry over spilt milk, kosher or otherwise.  You made your movie, you made your millions, so what are you going to do now: from a a 96-year-old man on a fixed income you're going to take advice?  I don't think so.For when you listen to me, my breath I'm not holding.But let me just say one more thing so that I can finish this bombastic review and give myself an enema before I go to bed. ... I'm sorry about President Kennedy.  He was a fine man, a regular prince of a fellow.  For weeks I couldn't digest properly, I was so upset.  As far as a normal bowel movement was concerned, forget about it.A couple hours before he got shot, I ate a pastrami sandwich.  Heard the news, couldn't pass that goddamn pastrami sandwich for three weeks.  A lump the size of Rhode Island in my kishkas.What a tragedy; the nation suffered, I suffered.  Eventually we found relief.You know, I have my own conspiracy theory.  Personally I think the pastrami sandwich I ate was a plot.  A plot by the Italians who live down the hall.  From the day I told them Alan Alda was half Jewish, they hated my guts.Anyway, like I said, it was a shame President Kennedy got shot.  I feel worse about him than about that skinny Jew Abraham Lincoln, when he got shot in the temple.If only, if only. ... If only JFK had ducked.  Would have been a different story altogether.  Less messy.  If nothing else, he could have gotten an allowance on the upholstery in the car.But, that aside, let's face it, let's tell the truth, Ollie baby, you know as well as I do that JFK would have been much better off married to Joan Rivers.  Because if JFK was married to Joan Rivers, when the plane landed in Dallas, forget about Dealey Plaza, she would have dragged him to Nieman-Marcus and they would have shopped all day.  End of story.Your pal,YashP.S.  Before I go, so that this stupendous review should end with a bang, here's a peppy-perky little ditty I wrote in honor of JFK.Maestro, if you please ...~ My name is Yasha Banana, a fan of JFK. ~~ If he had ducked instead of stood he'd be 93-years-old today. ~~ He'd be my pal I'd take him to a dance so he could shtup a shiksa. ~~ There's still a lot of young gals I know and that's no b.s., mistah.
