""Charlie""","[26, 30]","I thought the documentary was very insightful and allowed you to see a lot of what the public doesn't see when she is on stage in her zone.  It was beautifully filmed, executed, and edited.  It was pure and honest.  If you're not a believer of this woman's dedication and soul, then I pity you if this didn't change your mind!I think the concert was an added bonus, but I was a little disappointed with the editing being as I saw this live and it was amazing (and quite frankly better than it's parred down reincarnation, The Mrs. Carter Show).  For one, it's a very scaled down version of the show, which clocked in at nearly if not slightly over two hours.  Several songs from the second half of the show are omitted like ""I Miss You,"" ""Resentment,"" the Goo Goo Dolls ""Iris"" cover, ""If I Was a Boy,"" the Lauryn Hill ""Ex-Factor"" cover, ""Countdown,"" ""Irreplaceable,"" ""Jumpin' Jumpin',"" and ""Why Don't You Love Me.""  Two, I preferred the show without the editing.  ""Love On Top,"" came after ""End of Time"" but is played at the end during the credits.  ""Countdown"" was a stand-out performance from the show and only the intro was shown here.  ""Run the World (Girls)"" was also edited with the solo dancer intro shown first though it was performed at the end.Besides that, a great 2-for-1 bundle for any fan of Beyonce!",4,"Good, But Concert DVD is Not Full Show :-(",1385337600,"11 25, 2013",2013,1314,"['thought', 'documentary', 'was', 'very', 'insightful', 'allowed', 'see', 'lot', 'what', 'public', ""n't"", 'see', 'when', 'stage', 'zone', 'was', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'executed', 'edited', 'was', 'pure', 'honest', ""'re"", 'not', 'believer', 'woman', 'dedication', 'soul', 'then', 'pity', 'did', ""n't"", 'change', 'mind', 'think', 'concert', 'was', 'added', 'bonus', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'editing', 'being', 'saw', 'live', 'was', 'amazing', 'quite', 'frankly', 'better', 'parred', 'down', 'reincarnation', 'Mrs.', 'Carter', 'Show', 'one', 'very', 'scaled', 'down', 'version', 'show', 'clocked', 'nearly', 'not', 'slightly', 'two', 'hours', 'Several', 'songs', 'second', 'half', 'show', 'are', 'omitted', 'Miss', 'Resentment', 'Goo', 'Goo', 'Dolls', 'Iris', 'cover', 'Was', 'Boy', 'Lauryn', 'Hill', 'Ex-Factor', 'cover', 'Countdown', 'Irreplaceable', 'Jumpin', 'Jumpin', 'Why', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Love', 'Me', 'Two', 'preferred', 'show', 'editing', 'Love', 'Top', 'came', 'End', 'Time', 'played', 'end', 'credits', 'Countdown', 'was', 'stand-out', 'performance', 'show', 'only', 'intro', 'was', 'shown', 'here', 'Run', 'World', 'Girls', 'was', 'also', 'edited', 'solo', 'dancer', 'intro', 'shown', 'first', 'was', 'performed', 'end.Besides', 'great', '2-for-1', 'bundle', 'fan', 'Beyonce']",Life Is But A Dream

Beyonce really lets us into her life and shows us what life is really like in the spotlight.I applaud Beyonce, she really opened up and got personal; something she rarely ever does.The always-private Beyonce shows us the struggles of being an established artist, the difficulties of being a woman in a male-dominated world, and most of: that she is HUMAN!She shows us that she isn't perfect, that she has her off days, too.To all Beyonce fans (& Stans; I see you BeyHive!) This is a MUST!If you aren't a fan, I would still recommend it, since it is a great documentary that is moving & inspiring!Not only is the Documentary Great, but this DVD also includes a bonus disc that includes her concert at Revel, which she peformed 5 months after giving birth to her daughter, Blue Ivy!The DVD & Case came on time & in great condition.",5,Life is But a Sweet Dream (Or A Beautiful Nightmare),1399766400,"05 11, 2014",2014,858,"['Documentary', 'AMAZING', 'Beyonce', 'really', 'life', 'what', 'life', 'really', 'like', 'spotlight.I', 'applaud', 'Beyonce', 'really', 'opened', 'up', 'got', 'personal', 'something', 'rarely', 'ever', 'does.The', 'always-private', 'Beyonce', 'shows', 'struggles', 'being', 'established', 'artist', 'difficulties', 'being', 'woman', 'male-dominated', 'world', 'most', 'HUMAN', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'off', 'days', 'too.To', 'Beyonce', 'fans', 'Stans', 'see', 'BeyHive', 'MUST', 'are', ""n't"", 'fan', 'would', 'still', 'recommend', 'great', 'documentary', 'moving', 'inspiring', 'Not', 'only', 'Documentary', 'Great', 'DVD', 'also', 'bonus', 'disc', 'concert', 'Revel', 'peformed', '5', 'months', 'giving', 'birth', 'daughter', 'Blue', 'Ivy', 'DVD', 'Case', 'came', 'time', 'great', 'condition']",Life Is But A Dream
