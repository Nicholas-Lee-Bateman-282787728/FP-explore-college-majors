I immediately snapped it up as I outright love Film Movement.""Agata and the Storm (2004 release from Italy; 118 min.) brings a multi-character ensemble movie about Agata, a bookshop owner in her mid-to-late 40s, who somehow attracts the attention and eventually the love interest of a younger man, ""13 years younger"" (comments Agata), to be exact. Meanwhile Agata's brother Gustavo learns that he was adopted at a young age, and hence he's not Agata's ""real"" brother. There are plenty of other subplots too many to describe here. Will Agata find true love with her younger man? Does Gustavo come to terms with his new family situation? To tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience and you'll just have to see for youself how these questions, and other subplots, will play out.I love foreign movies as much as much about anyone you'll ever find, but I could not really get into this movie for whatever reason. The characters didn't resonate with me, and hence I had no emotional involvement or investment in this movie, despite all the talking and talking and talking. I kept thinking, hope against hope, that it would eventually get better but in the end it just didn't. This is only the second time in seeing dozens and dozens of Film Movement releases that I was disappointed. Maybe it was just me, I don't know.",3,"Multiple characters crowd Italian ""talkie""",1360800000,"02 14, 2013",2013,1496,"['recently', 'was', 'browsing', 'foreign', 'movie', 'section', 'local', 'library', 'fell', 'early', 'release', 'Film', 'Movement', 'catalog', 'foreign', 'indie', 'movies', 'immediately', 'snapped', 'up', 'outright', 'love', 'Film', 'Movement', 'Agata', 'Storm', '2004', 'release', 'Italy', '118', 'min', 'multi-character', 'ensemble', 'movie', 'Agata', 'bookshop', 'owner', 'mid-to-late', '40s', 'who', 'somehow', 'attention', 'eventually', 'love', 'interest', 'younger', 'man', '13', 'years', 'younger', 'comments', 'Agata', 'be', 'exact', 'Meanwhile', 'Agata', 'brother', 'Gustavo', 'was', 'adopted', 'young', 'age', 'hence', 'not', 'Agata', 'real', 'brother', 'are', 'plenty', 'other', 'subplots', 'too', 'many', 'describe', 'here', 'Will', 'Agata', 'find', 'true', 'love', 'younger', 'man', 'Gustavo', 'come', 'terms', 'new', 'family', 'situation', 'tell', 'more', 'plot', 'would', 'ruin', 'viewing', 'experience', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'see', 'how', 'questions', 'other', 'subplots', 'will', 'play', 'out.I', 'foreign', 'movies', 'as', 'much', 'much', 'anyone', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'find', 'could', 'not', 'really', 'get', 'movie', 'reason', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'resonate', 'hence', 'had', 'emotional', 'involvement', 'investment', 'movie', 'talking', 'talking', 'talking', 'kept', 'thinking', 'hope', 'hope', 'would', 'eventually', 'get', 'better', 'end', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'only', 'second', 'time', 'seeing', 'dozens', 'dozens', 'Film', 'Movement', 'was', 'disappointed', 'Maybe', 'was', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'know']",N/A
