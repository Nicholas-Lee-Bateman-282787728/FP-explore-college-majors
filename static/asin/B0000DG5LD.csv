A few pictures flashed of him, but it was 2 men who worked with him just talking about him. They said nice things, but I was lead to believe that the interviews were MJ. So...I was very dissappointed with the product. It did come very fast and I have no quams about the sender. They were good at getting it here quickly. People, you must be careful what you buy. There are alot of unauthorized and bad quality DVD's out there about MJ. I just did it again! Purchased a DVD and then was told it sucked too. ugh!

Some people cry during it and the documentary can be emotional.
