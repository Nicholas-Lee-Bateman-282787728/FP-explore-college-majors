922813,A3KMMXLJFQENDZ,B000A6T1YA,Alex A. Fintonis,"[7, 10]","I was really looking forward to seeing this movie.  I have always enjoyed Frankenstein's monster.  He probably is my favorite classic horror icon.  I have seen a lot of different Frankenstein films; some of them are cheesy, but fun.  I also have watched different versions of Mary Shelly's book and I enjoy them all, some more than others.  This film's plot takes a kind of continuation of Shelly's novel with some name changes.First of all it is extremely drawn out.  The plot just drags on with very little action or real character development.  The monster is very basic looking.  He has very little scaring, and is not very big or intimidating.  He is just a basic 6-foot man with semi long hair wearing a hood.  Doctor Victor Helios is an interesting character; basically he has been keeping himself alive for the couple of centuries trying to replace humanity with a superior race.  The monster is his first prototype from the eighteenth century who is trying to stop Helios. The whole idea of this film is pretty original, but it just was portrayed in a very slow and boring way.I just had a very hard time making through the movie.  Finally the film just ends and the viewer is left with too many unanswered questions.  What was keeping me from giving this film 1 star rating is other reviewers of the movie stated it was a pilot for a television show that was going to air on USA network but never did and fell through. Finding that piece of information helps me understand why the film just ends without any real closure.  Also the cinematography is done well for a made-for-TV-movie.  But this film just does not stand well on it's own.  The idea was in the right place but it just did not work right at all.",2,"The heart was in the right place, but...................",1151971200,"07 4, 2006",2006,1719,"['was', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'movie', 'have', 'always', 'enjoyed', 'Frankenstein', 'monster', 'probably', 'favorite', 'classic', 'horror', 'icon', 'have', 'seen', 'lot', 'different', 'Frankenstein', 'films', 'are', 'cheesy', 'fun', 'also', 'have', 'watched', 'different', 'versions', 'Mary', 'Shelly', 'book', 'enjoy', 'more', 'others', 'film', 'plot', 'kind', 'continuation', 'Shelly', 'novel', 'name', 'changes.First', 'extremely', 'drawn', 'out', 'plot', 'just', 'drags', 'very', 'little', 'action', 'real', 'character', 'development', 'monster', 'very', 'basic', 'looking', 'very', 'little', 'scaring', 'not', 'very', 'big', 'intimidating', 'just', 'basic', '6-foot', 'man', 'semi', 'long', 'hair', 'wearing', 'hood', 'Doctor', 'Victor', 'Helios', 'interesting', 'character', 'basically', 'been', 'keeping', 'alive', 'couple', 'centuries', 'trying', 'replace', 'humanity', 'superior', 'race', 'monster', 'first', 'prototype', 'eighteenth', 'century', 'who', 'trying', 'stop', 'Helios', 'whole', 'idea', 'film', 'pretty', 'original', 'just', 'was', 'portrayed', 'very', 'slow', 'boring', 'way.I', 'just', 'had', 'very', 'hard', 'time', 'making', 'movie', 'Finally', 'film', 'just', 'viewer', 'left', 'too', 'many', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'What', 'was', 'keeping', 'giving', 'film', '1', 'star', 'rating', 'other', 'reviewers', 'movie', 'stated', 'was', 'pilot', 'television', 'show', 'was', 'going', 'air', 'USA', 'network', 'never', 'did', 'fell', 'Finding', 'piece', 'information', 'understand', 'why', 'film', 'just', 'real', 'closure', 'Also', 'cinematography', 'done', 'well', 'made-for-TV-movie', 'film', 'just', 'not', 'stand', 'well', 'own', 'idea', 'was', 'right', 'place', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'work', 'right']",Frankenstein 2004 lgf

The writing is pretty good, but the cast is what really makes this one: Vincent Perez as the original monster, Thomas Krestchmann as the deranged scientist, Ivana Milicevic as his resurrected wife; and a crew of law enforcement including Parker Posey, Adam Goldberg, and Michael Madsen.Think the old TV show ""Beauty and the Beast"" more than ""Van Helsing."" This was directed by the guy who did The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and produced by Martin Scorsese, so you know it's got style for miles. But when I learned that this was loosely based on a book by Dean Koontz, Frankenstein lost a little of its charm -- which isn't fair, I know. I loved ol' Dean when I was a teenager, but I haven't been able to take his books for years. Maybe I owe him another visit, I don't know.For all its flaws (pacing, mostly -- and a tendency to fixate on the wrong details), I really enjoyed this aborted TV show and regretted the fact that it never found a home.

922815,A17RYD415IF0OA,B000A6T1YA,Christopher Horne,"[0, 0]","This movie was a horrible representation of the book by Dean Koontz.  I would have to say that Mr. Koontz did a great thing by taking his name off of the movie.  With that being said if you read the book you will understand what goes on in the movie more than a person would if they didn't read the book.  There was so much left out of this movie (I call it a movie because the series didn't go past the pilot) that a reader would be disappointed in the direction that the movie headed.If I was to rate this as a pilot (because that is what it was supposed to be) I would be giving it a much higher rating, 5 stars would definitely be fitting if it was a pilot.  Since this isn't a pilot anymore I am dropping the rating significantly because of everything that was left out.The scar on Deucalion face was horribly underplayed.  It looks like a skin discoloration with a couple of scars that one would get from a bike accident.  If a scar like he has makes him a freak well you could of used me without any added effects and I could of passed for Deucalion.  The tattoo was missing which would of added more mystery to Deucalion and probably made him look more scary (which he is supposed to be being the first creation).If this would be a TV series like it was supposed to be I would definitely be looking forward to watching the rest but sense it isn't a TV series I would not watch a sequel.

922817,AD9MPLYLMHKCC,B000A6T1YA,Ghoulie Guru,"[2, 3]","WARNING: possible spoilers ahead...Marcus Nispel clearly shows himself to be a talented filmmaker with this film. His Frankenstein has all the style of his Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake. Without a doubt, the man knows how to shoot a movie. However, despite the striking visuals, this movie winds up feeling a little vacuous. In a way, the movie itself mimics the creature of its title, being the somewhat half-formed, brainless and empty creation of a brilliant but misguided mind. In this case, Marcus Frankenstein started with good intentions and constructed a beautifully shot film, but neglected to put the brain into his creation. This version of Frankenstein suffers because it teeters on the brink of being unique and distinctive, but never really commits. Perhaps it's because it was made for television, and it's clearly been made with a strong PG aesthetic in mind.This story is not as much of a straightforward adaptation as a revisionist's version of Mary Shelley's novel. Frankenstein himself is much more like the Terell character in Blade Runner. He's an egotistical, megalomaniacal genius named Helios. Even with its departure from the standard Frankenstein story, this version feels much more in line with the tone and intention of Shelley's novel than most of the past cinematic versions of Frankenstein. Even keeping the tone intact, the story operates on a completely different engine, acting like a version of Seven, with Parker Posey playing the detective who is hunting down one of Frankenstein's psychotic creations.While I'm on the subject, I need to vent momentarily. Parker Posey really is one of the worst actresses around. I used to like her when she was the quirky girl in movies like Best in Show. But her ridiculous vampire queen in Blade: Trinity and her laughable portrayal of a shotgun-toting detective in this movie have made me lose all respect for her. But not even Parker's silly acting can completely ruin this movie. Although it does feel a little thin at points, this is still an interesting and somewhat new approach to an old myth, beautifully shot and edited by Marcus Nispel... who may be a modern day Frankenstein.",3,A Half-Formed Creation,1137369600,"01 16, 2006",2006,2162,"['WARNING', 'possible', 'spoilers', 'ahead', 'Marcus', 'Nispel', 'clearly', 'be', 'talented', 'filmmaker', 'film', 'Frankenstein', 'style', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'remake', 'doubt', 'man', 'how', 'shoot', 'movie', 'However', 'striking', 'visuals', 'movie', 'up', 'feeling', 'little', 'vacuous', 'way', 'movie', 'creature', 'title', 'being', 'somewhat', 'half-formed', 'brainless', 'empty', 'creation', 'brilliant', 'misguided', 'mind', 'case', 'Marcus', 'Frankenstein', 'started', 'good', 'intentions', 'constructed', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'film', 'neglected', 'put', 'brain', 'creation', 'version', 'Frankenstein', 'suffers', 'brink', 'being', 'unique', 'distinctive', 'never', 'really', 'commits', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'made', 'television', 'clearly', 'been', 'made', 'strong', 'PG', 'aesthetic', 'mind.This', 'story', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'straightforward', 'adaptation', 'revisionist', 'version', 'Mary', 'Shelley', 'novel', 'Frankenstein', 'much', 'more', 'Terell', 'character', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'egotistical', 'megalomaniacal', 'genius', 'named', 'Helios', 'Even', 'departure', 'standard', 'Frankenstein', 'story', 'version', 'much', 'more', 'line', 'tone', 'intention', 'Shelley', 'novel', 'most', 'past', 'cinematic', 'versions', 'Frankenstein', 'Even', 'keeping', 'tone', 'intact', 'story', 'completely', 'different', 'engine', 'acting', 'version', 'Seven', 'Parker', 'Posey', 'playing', 'detective', 'who', 'hunting', 'down', 'one', 'Frankenstein', 'psychotic', 'creations.While', ""'m"", 'subject', 'need', 'vent', 'momentarily', 'Parker', 'Posey', 'really', 'one', 'worst', 'actresses', 'used', 'like', 'when', 'was', 'quirky', 'girl', 'movies', 'Best', 'Show', 'ridiculous', 'vampire', 'queen', 'Blade', 'Trinity', 'laughable', 'portrayal', 'shotgun-toting', 'detective', 'movie', 'have', 'made', 'lose', 'respect', 'not', 'even', 'Parker', 'silly', 'acting', 'can', 'completely', 'ruin', 'movie', 'feel', 'little', 'thin', 'points', 'still', 'interesting', 'somewhat', 'new', 'approach', 'old', 'myth', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'edited', 'Marcus', 'Nispel', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'modern', 'day', 'Frankenstein']",Frankenstein 2004 lgf

922824,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000A6T1YA,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[24, 27]","The first thing you need to know about this particular ""Frankenstein"" is that it the pilot for an aborted USA Network series based on concepts and characters by Dean Koontz.  However, Koontz and USA apparently came to a parting of the waysd with two significant results: Koontz's name disappeared from the USA project and the author wrote a series of novels with Kevin J. Anderson, the first of which, ""Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Book One: Prodigal Son,"" appears to cover a lot of the same ground (but I have not read it and therefore can not speak to specific differences).  This may well be enough information to forestall Koontz's fans from watching this pilot movie and proceeding directly to the novels.  But I like pilots and tend to watch as many as I can because I find them intrinsically interesting.The premise of this ""Frankenstein"" is basically that Mary Shelley got most of the story right and changed some names.  In the novel Frankenstein brings his creation to life and then abandons him, with the latter being his greater sin for which he and his family must pay.  In this pilot the doctor is now named Victor Helios (Thomas Krestchmann), the filthy rich owner of a biotech company in New Orleans.  Helios has found ways of keeping himself alive for several centuries and has been continuing his experiments with an eye towards replacing flawed humanity with his master race spawned in his company's vats.  Helios even gets to program his creations as he desires and has just come up with a new version of his wife, Erika (Ivana Milicevic).  A good question here is whether ""Frankenstein"" still applied to the doctor, as in the novel, or to his creation, as in pop culture, but it does not matter because both are here.The first creation is now called Deucalion (Vincent Perez), and while the name comes from classical mythology it is not, as you might suspect, one associated with Prometheus.  As you will recall, Prometheus created the first humans in Greek mythology and the subtitle of Shelley's novel was ""The Modern Prometheus.""  Decaulion, on the other hand, is the Greek counterpart to Noah, who survives the great flood with his wife Pyrrha and repopulates the world.  However, to the extent that he is the first human to have a name in mythology, Decaulion has that in common with Adam as well.  Since Helios (the name of the god of the sun, son of Hyperion) is the villain, that allows Decaulion to be the heroic figure.  This is necessary because there are a whole bunch of Helios creations running around and one of them appears to be a serial killer.Working on the case are Detective Carson O'Conner (Parker Posey) and her partner Detective Michael Sloane (Adam Goldberg), and once Carson and Decaulion start running into each other on a regular basis you are going to have to make a point of reminding yourself this is ""Frankenstein"" and not ""Beauty and the Beast"" (the Vincent and Catharine one on television and not the Disney musical one that was nominated for a Best Picture Oscar).  This is key because that gives you a better sense of the dynamic of this would-be series than having watched all of the Universal films regarding Frankenstein.  Also involved in the case and its developments is Detective Harker, and since he is played by Michael Madsen you know this is not a good sign.  There is more to the serial killer than meets the eyes, and we find out some interesting things about these creations that would have implications for the series that this pilot never got off the ground.As much as I like Posey as an actress with strong Independent credibility and Goldberg as comic relief in just about everything he does, they really seem too young to be detectives.  I also have some questions as to how Helios can create enough of his creatures to keep up with the birth rate in New Orleans let along the state of Louisiana, the former states of the Confederacy, the United States, North American, the Western Hemisphere and eventually the entire world, because I tried doing the math and I do not see it working out that way.  The script by John Shiban, who worked as both a writer and a producer on ""The X-Files,"" certainly sets up sufficient premises for an on-going series, but I do not know if it is a good thing when I find myself more interested in the relationship between Helios and Erika than the one between Decaulion and Catherine, er, I mean Carson.The reason I ended up rounding up on this one in the end is because I liked the look of the film, not just in terms of Leslie Keel's art direction, but also the efforts of director Marcus Nispel.  His updated version of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" creeped me out, which is a pretty good accomplishment given more of the jetsam and flotsam out there in the world of contemporary horror films.  Take into account that he is doing this for television (albeit cable) and not a theatrical film and the results are pretty impressive.  There is a great look to the film and Nispel is again working with cinematographer Daniel Pearl to come up with some interesting shots, so if you do not think that style over substance is an inherently bad thing that would be another reason to give this ""Frankenstein"" a try (and if you really want the substance the Koontz-Anderson novels are out there waiting for you).",4,A Dean Koontz

In general, it's very difficult to do justice to a novel within a 1 1/2 to 2 hour film. Unless you do a mini-series like Stephen King did, but you still can't pack all the details into it.  And yet, like Koontz's other Hollywood attempts, this one is worth watching (if for nothing else) just to get an idea what these characters might look and sound like.  Now I can go back and reread Koontz's Frankenstein series and picture Parker Posey as Carson.So if you're a big Koontz fan like I am, it's worth at least one viewing.  Compared to the horrible jobs they did with trying to bring The Watchers to the big screen, I'd say they did a slightly better job on this one.  But I think Phantoms was probably the best attempt.There are so many things that could have been done better in this movie, with minimal effort and expense, but I think that once Koontz dropped out of the project it kind of just got finished in limbo.  The extra effort to make this movie really good just wasn't there.  I was kind of hoping they would have made it into a series or even mini-series, and see if it might have improved as it went along.I agree with the other reviewers that you should definitely read the books first, and then watch this movie.

Parker Posey is good as Detective Carson O'Connor, but Adam Goldberg is miscast as her wisecracking sidekick.  Thomas Krestchmann (so good in a small but pivotal role in THE PIANIST) doesn't quite have the megalomaniac frenzy that's in the novels, but he does an admirable job.  Michael Madsen is more subdued than usual in his role as Detective Jonathan Harker (irony with a name taken from fellow gothic thriller DRACULA).
