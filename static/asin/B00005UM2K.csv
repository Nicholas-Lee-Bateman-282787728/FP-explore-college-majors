684403,A1ADGDZFUKW0TJ,B00005UM2K,Andrew P. Kluka,"[0, 0]","This is a DVD presentation of a portion of a British television programme documenting the turmoil of the 60's and some idea of Rock's importance in this spectacular decade. Part of the Doors' performance at the Roundhouse Theatre in London to kick off their 1968 British and Northern European tour is presented here.The Doors are shown performing between cuts to powerful anti-war videos of the time. The riots in London, the mayhem outside the Democratic  National Convention in Chicago, The National Guard advancing with bayonets leveled at the protesters in Grant Park, the bedlam at the corner of Michigan and Balbo in Downtown Chicago, Mayor Daley of Chicago complaining about the lack of respect shown to his police, etc. are depicted while the Doors music (i.e. The Unknown Soldier, etc) rocks on. Mayor Daley made two comments during this time that aroused worldwide anger...and laughter... One was his order to ""Shoot to kill!"" if the police felt threatened. Fortunately, the world was aghast at this and Daley quickly rescinded this ""order"". The other, laughable comment was his quip that ""The police are not there to create disorder, they're there to preserve disorder!"" (no misprint). The viewer of this TV progamme years ago may  still have had these recollections fresh in his mind. They add to the picture.The Doors ...and their spectacular ""one of"" frontman, Jim Morrison are at their very best.The performance of ""Backdoor Man"" depicted here is perhaps the finest live Blues Rock performance I've ever seen on DVD from ANY band, at ANY time.  It is raunchy, provocative, inspired and just plain POWERFUL. It alone is worth the price of the video. Jim's exit from the stage as the last song ended was masterful. He truly was a ROCK STAR.The Doors RULE!",5,See This To Understand Why People Still Love The Doors,1318118400,"10 9, 2011",2011,1768,"['DVD', 'presentation', 'portion', 'British', 'television', 'programme', 'documenting', 'turmoil', '60', 'idea', 'Rock', 'importance', 'spectacular', 'decade', 'Part', 'Doors', 'performance', 'Roundhouse', 'Theatre', 'London', 'kick', 'off', '1968', 'British', 'Northern', 'European', 'tour', 'presented', 'here.The', 'Doors', 'are', 'shown', 'performing', 'cuts', 'powerful', 'anti-war', 'videos', 'time', 'riots', 'London', 'mayhem', 'Democratic', 'National', 'Convention', 'Chicago', 'National', 'Guard', 'advancing', 'bayonets', 'leveled', 'protesters', 'Grant', 'Park', 'bedlam', 'corner', 'Michigan', 'Balbo', 'Downtown', 'Chicago', 'Mayor', 'Daley', 'Chicago', 'complaining', 'lack', 'respect', 'shown', 'police', 'etc', 'are', 'depicted', 'Doors', 'music', 'i.e', 'Unknown', 'Soldier', 'etc', 'Mayor', 'Daley', 'made', 'two', 'comments', 'time', 'aroused', 'worldwide', 'anger', 'laughter', 'One', 'was', 'order', 'Shoot', 'kill', 'police', 'felt', 'threatened', 'Fortunately', 'world', 'was', 'aghast', 'Daley', 'quickly', 'rescinded', 'order', 'other', 'laughable', 'comment', 'was', 'quip', 'police', 'are', 'not', 'there', 'create', 'disorder', ""'re"", 'preserve', 'disorder', 'misprint', 'viewer', 'TV', 'progamme', 'years', 'ago', 'may', 'still', 'have', 'had', 'recollections', 'fresh', 'mind', 'add', 'picture.The', 'Doors', 'spectacular', 'one', 'frontman', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'are', 'very', 'best.The', 'performance', 'Backdoor', 'Man', 'depicted', 'here', 'perhaps', 'finest', 'live', 'Blues', 'Rock', 'performance', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'DVD', 'ANY', 'band', 'ANY', 'time', 'raunchy', 'provocative', 'inspired', 'just', 'plain', 'POWERFUL', 'alone', 'price', 'video', 'Jim', 'exit', 'stage', 'last', 'song', 'ended', 'was', 'masterful', 'truly', 'was', 'ROCK', 'STAR.The', 'Doors', 'RULE']",N/A
684404,A1CQCS17LQCHIH,B00005UM2K,Jinkyu,"[1, 1]","Even though ""The Doors Are Open"" is a made-for-TV documentary of an indoor show, it shows The Doors performing in a raw and gritty manner in what is literally a ""heated"" atmosphere.  They sweat profusely during their performance, most conspicuously lead singer Jim Morrison in his white shirt.  When he howls out the lyrics to ""Backdoor Man,"" he is the apotheosis of raunchy intensity.  The fact that the filming is in black and white only serves to magnify the hard-core aura of the performance.The Doors dish out their hard-rock songs ""Five to One,"" ""The Unknown Soldier,"" and ""When the Music's Over"" as if to satisfy a craving conjured up by the film's introductory statement that the group shows ""what they are against rather than what they are for.""  Various rioting, revolutionary, and reactionary video footage is interspersed within the performances of songs, but particularly during those three.  Also, The Doors field some questions from interviewers in close-up filming.Guitarist Robby Krieger's songs ""Light My Fire"" and ""Spanish Caravan"" are also performed in a heavy-set manner.  ""Light My Fire"" sounds perhaps out of key and is often more harsh than pretty.  In the instrumental interlude, the camera follows Jim dancing and journeying all around the stage, and off, performing some acrobatics and offering ladies the mike.  In the ""Unknown Soldier"" Jim does his standard collapse after Robby Krieger's ""gunfire"" from his guitar.  The film shows Jim is really soaking by this time.The Doors played ""Break on Through"" in their Roundhouse shows, but unfortunately it is not included here.  However, the songs they did play really boiled over.  The Sun the group was Waiting For was certainly here in this performance.  With their next album, the group chose to Parade More Softly.",4,Hot in Black and White,1237420800,"03 19, 2009",2009,1793,"['Even', 'Doors', 'Are', 'Open', 'made-for-TV', 'documentary', 'indoor', 'show', 'Doors', 'performing', 'raw', 'gritty', 'manner', 'what', 'literally', 'heated', 'atmosphere', 'sweat', 'profusely', 'performance', 'most', 'conspicuously', 'lead', 'singer', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'white', 'shirt', 'When', 'out', 'lyrics', 'Backdoor', 'Man', 'apotheosis', 'raunchy', 'intensity', 'fact', 'filming', 'black', 'white', 'only', 'magnify', 'hard-core', 'aura', 'performance.The', 'Doors', 'out', 'hard-rock', 'songs', 'Five', 'One', 'Unknown', 'Soldier', 'When', 'Music', 'Over', 'satisfy', 'craving', 'conjured', 'up', 'film', 'introductory', 'statement', 'group', 'what', 'are', 'rather', 'what', 'are', 'Various', 'rioting', 'revolutionary', 'reactionary', 'video', 'footage', 'interspersed', 'performances', 'songs', 'particularly', 'three', 'Also', 'Doors', 'field', 'questions', 'interviewers', 'close-up', 'filming.Guitarist', 'Robby', 'Krieger', 'songs', 'Light', 'My', 'Fire', 'Spanish', 'Caravan', 'are', 'also', 'performed', 'heavy-set', 'manner', 'Light', 'My', 'Fire', 'perhaps', 'key', 'often', 'more', 'harsh', 'pretty', 'instrumental', 'interlude', 'camera', 'Jim', 'dancing', 'journeying', 'stage', 'performing', 'acrobatics', 'offering', 'ladies', 'mike', 'Unknown', 'Soldier', 'Jim', 'standard', 'collapse', 'Robby', 'Krieger', 'gunfire', 'guitar', 'film', 'shows', 'Jim', 'really', 'soaking', 'time.The', 'Doors', 'played', 'Break', 'Through', 'Roundhouse', 'shows', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'included', 'here', 'However', 'songs', 'did', 'play', 'really', 'boiled', 'over', 'Sun', 'group', 'was', 'Waiting', 'was', 'certainly', 'here', 'performance', 'next', 'album', 'group', 'chose', 'Parade', 'More', 'Softly']",N/A

I was wrong and it's a full yet short show. At first I thought man sound quality is horrible, but I got use to it. I thought to myself the quiality is exceptionale. The document footage of Presidents and riots are intresting, but the only flaw is that the footage cuts in and you miss parts of a song. If your'e a true Doors fan you could over look these flaws.

684406,A2X2X8S80WW29I,B00005UM2K,J. R. Cagle,"[0, 0]","I agree with the first two reviews. The performance is exceptional and represents the whole band at their absoulute best. Stand out tracks are a brilliant Spanish Caravan and outstanding When The Music's Over. Pity the sound quality which merits a star deduction but all the instruments are perfectly discernable and cranked up loud enough it sounds good to my ears. Its not DVD modern quality but look folks it was recorded using Granada TV's technology at that time which was 2 track mono. Not much can be done about that even if it was well recorded which I believe it was considering the equipment used. Jim Morrison shines in this performance which is his best of any of the taped performances I have seen. The concert is far better than the Hollywood Bowl show which has vastly better sound and color to it but is only an average performance. The Roundhouse show also is better than the PBS performance featured on the Soft Parade which is a good performance but features a rather worn out and shaggy Jim Morrison. This DVD feautures the Doors at their best folks and is only bettered by the 2CD set &quot;In Concert&quot; which was a compilation of a variety of performances but is a fantastic overall live set of the Doors produced by the late Paul Rothchild. Get this DVD the original 6 albums, the in concert 2 cd set and the Doors Collection DVD and you will have the ultimate Doors Collection.",4,Exceptional Performance by The Doors!,1076284800,"02 9, 2004",2004,1405,"['agree', 'first', 'two', 'reviews', 'performance', 'exceptional', 'whole', 'band', 'absoulute', 'best', 'Stand', 'out', 'tracks', 'are', 'brilliant', 'Spanish', 'Caravan', 'outstanding', 'When', 'Music', 'Over', 'Pity', 'sound', 'quality', 'star', 'deduction', 'instruments', 'are', 'perfectly', 'discernable', 'cranked', 'up', 'loud', 'good', 'ears', 'not', 'DVD', 'modern', 'quality', 'look', 'folks', 'was', 'recorded', 'using', 'Granada', 'TV', 'technology', 'time', 'was', '2', 'track', 'mono', 'Not', 'much', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'even', 'was', 'well', 'recorded', 'believe', 'was', 'considering', 'equipment', 'used', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'shines', 'performance', 'best', 'taped', 'performances', 'have', 'seen', 'concert', 'far', 'better', 'Hollywood', 'Bowl', 'show', 'vastly', 'better', 'sound', 'color', 'only', 'average', 'performance', 'Roundhouse', 'show', 'also', 'better', 'PBS', 'performance', 'featured', 'Soft', 'Parade', 'good', 'performance', 'rather', 'worn', 'out', 'shaggy', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'DVD', 'Doors', 'best', 'folks', 'only', 'bettered', '2CD', 'set', 'quot', 'Concert', 'quot', 'was', 'compilation', 'variety', 'performances', 'fantastic', 'overall', 'live', 'set', 'Doors', 'produced', 'late', 'Paul', 'Rothchild', 'Get', 'DVD', 'original', '6', 'albums', 'concert', '2', 'cd', 'set', 'Doors', 'Collection', 'DVD', 'will', 'have', 'ultimate', 'Doors', 'Collection']",N/A
684407,A3BRHTAUBZUGK8,B00005UM2K,"Jym Cherry ""Writing Under The Influence of Ro...","[2, 2]","The Doors Are Open may be Morrison's fictional documentary. Although, Morrison was talking about The Doors' career that ""it's making itself,"" he could also be talking about this documentary. The performances and music in this DVD are The Doors performances when they appeared in England, at the Roundhouse, the thesis of the documentary and the presentation aren't a vision of how The Doors saw themselves either then or now, but how the BBC/Granada TV saw them.The concert footage is intercut with footage of demonstrations, political figures such as Nixon, Reagan, George Wallace, Mayor Daley, with the discordant sound of When The Music's Over providing the soundtrack for the riot at the Democratic National Convention. All the concert footage of The Doors is excellent, it's up close on the stage. While it is in black and white none of it looks grainy or washed out as other period pieces look. The sound is live sound from the performances and this is The Doors at their best, Morrison at his most theatrical and the band backing him with pounding music, this is best listened to LOUD! There are only a of couple occasions when the sound is a bit lacking like Morrison's microphone goes out. You can see this during The Unknown Soldier when he's using two mic's and doesn't know which mic is live.Not only is The Doors performances on this, but also footage of The Doors in England and during interviews that has now become classic Doors footage. Things such as the band going through customs and identifying themselves and their profession, John Densomore on percussion, Ray Manzarek's very stiff and formal recitation of his name and birthdate, and finally Morrison identifying himself and profession only as Jim, a scene which was recreated in Oliver Stone's The Doors. Some of Morrison's most famous quotes are also from the English interviews such as him saying ""to be a superstar in this day and age one has to be an assassin or a politician.""Granada TV was trying to present The Doors as a band with a political context they miss the point and some of the footage of the strife in the streets misses the point of The Doors. The Doors were truly a revolutionary group, while other bands of the time were making fairly pedestrian songs about peace, love and flowers, The Doors were there to confront and this comes out in the concert footage. You can really see that when The Doors go into Celebration of the Lizard and terrifying the audience with the discordant sounds and lyrics, and then suddenly segue into Light My Fire. The Doors wanted to confront their audience, make a statement of the times, confront the prevailing days wisdom, and the music and the lyrics do exactly that.",5,Morrison's Fictional Documentary,1247875200,"07 18, 2009",2009,2697,"['Doors', 'Are', 'Open', 'may', 'be', 'Morrison', 'fictional', 'documentary', 'Morrison', 'was', 'talking', 'Doors', 'career', 'making', 'could', 'also', 'be', 'talking', 'documentary', 'performances', 'music', 'DVD', 'are', 'Doors', 'performances', 'when', 'appeared', 'England', 'Roundhouse', 'thesis', 'documentary', 'presentation', 'are', ""n't"", 'vision', 'how', 'Doors', 'saw', 'then', 'now', 'how', 'BBC/Granada', 'TV', 'saw', 'them.The', 'concert', 'footage', 'intercut', 'footage', 'demonstrations', 'political', 'figures', 'such', 'Nixon', 'Reagan', 'George', 'Wallace', 'Mayor', 'Daley', 'discordant', 'sound', 'When', 'Music', 'Over', 'providing', 'soundtrack', 'riot', 'Democratic', 'National', 'Convention', 'concert', 'footage', 'Doors', 'excellent', 'up', 'close', 'stage', 'black', 'white', 'none', 'grainy', 'washed', 'out', 'other', 'period', 'pieces', 'look', 'sound', 'live', 'sound', 'performances', 'Doors', 'best', 'Morrison', 'most', 'theatrical', 'band', 'backing', 'pounding', 'music', 'best', 'listened', 'LOUD', 'are', 'only', 'couple', 'occasions', 'when', 'sound', 'bit', 'lacking', 'Morrison', 'microphone', 'out', 'can', 'see', 'Unknown', 'Soldier', 'when', 'using', 'two', 'mic', ""n't"", 'know', 'mic', 'live.Not', 'only', 'Doors', 'performances', 'also', 'footage', 'Doors', 'England', 'interviews', 'now', 'become', 'classic', 'Doors', 'footage', 'Things', 'such', 'band', 'going', 'customs', 'identifying', 'profession', 'John', 'Densomore', 'percussion', 'Ray', 'Manzarek', 'very', 'stiff', 'formal', 'recitation', 'name', 'birthdate', 'finally', 'Morrison', 'identifying', 'profession', 'only', 'Jim', 'scene', 'was', 'recreated', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'Doors', 'Morrison', 'most', 'famous', 'quotes', 'are', 'also', 'English', 'interviews', 'such', 'saying', 'be', 'superstar', 'day', 'age', 'one', 'be', 'assassin', 'politician', 'Granada', 'TV', 'was', 'trying', 'present', 'Doors', 'band', 'political', 'context', 'miss', 'point', 'footage', 'strife', 'streets', 'point', 'Doors', 'Doors', 'were', 'truly', 'revolutionary', 'group', 'other', 'bands', 'time', 'were', 'making', 'fairly', 'pedestrian', 'songs', 'peace', 'love', 'flowers', 'Doors', 'were', 'there', 'confront', 'out', 'concert', 'footage', 'can', 'really', 'see', 'when', 'Doors', 'go', 'Celebration', 'Lizard', 'terrifying', 'audience', 'discordant', 'sounds', 'lyrics', 'then', 'suddenly', 'segue', 'Light', 'My', 'Fire', 'Doors', 'wanted', 'confront', 'audience', 'make', 'statement', 'times', 'confront', 'prevailing', 'days', 'wisdom', 'music', 'lyrics', 'do', 'exactly']",N/A
