1115498,A3EBHHCZO6V2A4,B000XUUQRE,"Amaranth ""music fan""","[8, 9]","Susan Cooper's ""The Dark is Rising"" has been considered a teenage fantasy lit classic since it was released in 1973 and received a Newberry Award. It powerfully blended Arthurian myth, Celtic legends, Welsh customs and language along with the-then present day (post-WWII England) Unfortunately, in its translation to the big screen, it lost most of its spirit, along with the plot. Catholic author Michael O'Brien, in his book ""Landscape with Dragons"",lambasted the series for being insufficiently Christian;one wonders if he'd be happy to see how the plot has gotten an extreme makeover.Evangelical director Michael Cunningham (""Path to 9/11"") purged the story of its pagan elements. For example, the hero Will Stanton has his birthday on Dec. 23 instead of Midwinter's day. The theological argument between Will and the Rector in the church is replaced with a cheesy battle with hundreds of snakes. He finds one of the signs in a stained glass window depicting Eve giving the Forbidden Fruit to Adam.The Book of Gramarye is replaced with ""The Book of the Signs"" with a Celtic cross. There is an added plot element of Will having a lost twin brother who is a ""prodigal son"" figure. In the book, the large Stanton family exemplifies ""family values"" evangelicals would enjoy;however, in the movie,they're dysfunctional,like an Afterschool Special. Evangelicals are fascinated with dysfunctional families. I've been to Christmas musicals that tackled subjects like divorce and abortion. Will's older brothers beat up on him; his father has become negligent in his obsession with physics; Will's brother Max is a college dropout.In the books,Will is 11;he learns he is an Old One and immortal-there isn't a romantic element. In the movie,Will is pubescent and dealing with his attraction to girls.On the positive side, Alexander Ludwig gives a convincing performance as Will. He captures the adolescent angst perfectly,the strangeness of puberty. Gregory Smith, looking a great deal handsomer with facial hair, is pitch-perfect as Max tempted to the Dark. Former Dr. Who Christopher Eccleston is more menacing as the evil country doctor rather than as the feathered Rider. Ian McShane,who I'll always associate with his role as Judas Iscariot in Franco Zeferelli's ""Jesus of Nazareth"", is excellent as the sagely Merriman Lyon. He has the gravitas.The special effects are also spectacular.Unfortunately, there are cheesy elements as well. The conflicts between Will and the Rider can be summed up as-Rider:Give me the Signs!Will:No!Maybe the Rider wanted to see the M.Night Shmayalan movie with Joaquin Phoenix&Mel; Gibson. There's a magical snow globe (""Rosebud""),evil mall police,and Will googling ""light and dark."" It's overly modernized with cellphones and iPods. The opening sequence recalls High School Musical;one expects the British kids to break out singing,""We're all in this together!"" Worse, Light and Dark aren't explained. In Cooper's sequence,Will's role is to bring balance to Light and Dark. This has been expunged. The Walker has been cut out. The cinematography is dizzying and induces motion sickness. It's a tilt-a-whirl in the movies!""The Seeker"" comes across as a half-baked Harry Potter clone (in fact,the actor who starred as Cedric in Goblet of Fire now stars as one of Will's brothers) It lacks a sense of humor...and depth. Scriptwriter John Hodge was dismissive of the Arthurian elements and deemed them confusing (despite the fact that Merriman is supposed to be Merlin himself). The moviemakers should've gone all Celtic&stayed; true to the spirit of the books. It's telling that the movie's title is ""The Seeker"",a term favored by both evangelical and progressive churches. Seekers denote those looking for spirituality in their lives. Sadly,this movie lacks spirituality. Instead of being a mystical adventure, it's a generic sword-and-sorcery flick.",2,I saw the sign,1192406400,"10 15, 2007",2007,3880,"['Susan', 'Cooper', 'Dark', 'Rising', 'been', 'considered', 'teenage', 'fantasy', 'lit', 'classic', 'was', 'released', '1973', 'received', 'Newberry', 'Award', 'powerfully', 'blended', 'Arthurian', 'myth', 'Celtic', 'Welsh', 'customs', 'language', 'along', 'the-then', 'present', 'day', 'post-WWII', 'England', 'Unfortunately', 'translation', 'big', 'screen', 'lost', 'most', 'spirit', 'plot', 'Catholic', 'author', 'Michael', ""O'Brien"", 'book', 'Landscape', 'Dragons', 'lambasted', 'series', 'being', 'insufficiently', 'Christian', 'one', ""'d"", 'be', 'happy', 'see', 'how', 'plot', 'gotten', 'extreme', 'makeover.Evangelical', 'director', 'Michael', 'Cunningham', 'Path', '9/11', 'purged', 'story', 'pagan', 'elements', 'example', 'hero', 'Will', 'Stanton', 'birthday', 'Dec.', '23', 'instead', 'Midwinter', 'day', 'theological', 'argument', 'Will', 'Rector', 'church', 'replaced', 'cheesy', 'battle', 'hundreds', 'snakes', 'one', 'signs', 'stained', 'glass', 'window', 'depicting', 'Eve', 'giving', 'Forbidden', 'Fruit', 'Adam.The', 'Book', 'Gramarye', 'replaced', 'Book', 'Signs', 'Celtic', 'cross', 'added', 'plot', 'element', 'Will', 'having', 'lost', 'twin', 'brother', 'who', 'prodigal', 'son', 'figure', 'book', 'large', 'Stanton', 'family', 'family', 'values', 'evangelicals', 'would', 'enjoy', 'however', 'movie', ""'re"", 'dysfunctional', 'Afterschool', 'Special', 'Evangelicals', 'are', 'fascinated', 'dysfunctional', 'families', ""'ve"", 'been', 'Christmas', 'musicals', 'tackled', 'subjects', 'divorce', 'abortion', 'Will', 'older', 'brothers', 'beat', 'up', 'father', 'become', 'negligent', 'obsession', 'physics', 'Will', 'brother', 'Max', 'college', 'books', 'Will', '11', 'Old', 'One', 'immortal-there', ""n't"", 'romantic', 'element', 'movie', 'Will', 'pubescent', 'dealing', 'attraction', 'girls.On', 'positive', 'side', 'Alexander', 'Ludwig', 'convincing', 'performance', 'Will', 'adolescent', 'angst', 'perfectly', 'strangeness', 'puberty', 'Gregory', 'Smith', 'looking', 'great', 'deal', 'handsomer', 'facial', 'hair', 'pitch-perfect', 'Max', 'tempted', 'Dark', 'Former', 'Dr.', 'Who', 'Christopher', 'Eccleston', 'more', 'menacing', 'evil', 'country', 'doctor', 'rather', 'feathered', 'Rider', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'who', ""'ll"", 'always', 'associate', 'role', 'Judas', 'Iscariot', 'Franco', 'Zeferelli', 'Jesus', 'Nazareth', 'excellent', 'sagely', 'Merriman', 'Lyon', 'gravitas.The', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'also', 'spectacular.Unfortunately', 'are', 'cheesy', 'elements', 'well', 'conflicts', 'Will', 'Rider', 'can', 'be', 'summed', 'up', 'as-Rider', 'Give', 'Signs', 'Will', 'Maybe', 'Rider', 'wanted', 'see', 'M.Night', 'Shmayalan', 'movie', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'magical', 'snow', 'globe', 'Rosebud', 'evil', 'mall', 'police', 'Will', 'googling', 'light', 'dark', 'overly', 'modernized', 'cellphones', 'iPods', 'opening', 'sequence', 'High', 'School', 'Musical', 'one', 'British', 'kids', 'break', 'out', 'singing', ""'re"", 'together', 'Worse', 'Light', 'Dark', 'are', ""n't"", 'explained', 'Cooper', 'sequence', 'Will', 'role', 'bring', 'balance', 'Light', 'Dark', 'been', 'expunged', 'Walker', 'been', 'cut', 'out', 'cinematography', 'dizzying', 'induces', 'motion', 'sickness', 'tilt-a-whirl', 'movies', 'Seeker', 'across', 'half-baked', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'clone', 'fact', 'actor', 'who', 'starred', 'Cedric', 'Goblet', 'Fire', 'now', 'one', 'Will', 'brothers', 'sense', 'humor', 'depth', 'Scriptwriter', 'John', 'Hodge', 'was', 'dismissive', 'Arthurian', 'elements', 'deemed', 'confusing', 'fact', 'Merriman', 'supposed', 'be', 'Merlin', 'moviemakers', 'should', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'Celtic', 'stayed', 'true', 'spirit', 'books', 'telling', 'movie', 'title', 'Seeker', 'term', 'favored', 'evangelical', 'progressive', 'churches', 'Seekers', 'denote', 'looking', 'spirituality', 'lives', 'Sadly', 'movie', 'spirituality', 'Instead', 'being', 'mystical', 'adventure', 'generic', 'sword-and-sorcery', 'flick']",The Seeker

1115500,AK0CENM3LUM28,B000XUUQRE,Amazon Customer,"[2, 3]","Seeker / B000XUUQRE*Spoilers*There's a lot of reviews online already from fans of the book series this movie is allegedly based upon, and the overall consensus seems to be that ""Seeker"" is a terrible film adaptation of a wonderful book series and that if you're only coming to this movie because you're a fan of the book, you should give it a miss, and I definitely respect that. I haven't read the book series yet (although it's definitely on my To-Do list), so this review will be of the movie itself, as it stands alone, without consideration for whether the adaptation was well done.If you haven't read the books and are just looking for something mindless and wholesome to pass an evening with the kids, ""Seeker"" will fit the bill, but there's nothing here that you haven't seen before ad nauseum. My first viewing of ""Seeker"" was a resounding ""Eh"", but I had just recently had my socks completely blown off byThe Spiderwick Chronicles, and I thought perhaps my unenthusiasm for ""Seeker"" might have been at least in part because it paled in comparison. Having watched it again recently, however, with the same result, I just have to say that ""Seeker"" is tired, worn, and overdone at this point.There seems to be some kind of children's' adventure movie boilerplate in Hollywood that gets stamped onto every book series out of the gate, now that ""Harry Potter"" has proved wildly successful, and the result is that far too many original and interesting books are turned into sore-fest MacGuffin quests. We saw it withThe Golden CompassandCity of Ember, for example, and really with countless others that deserve a better fate. ""Seeker"" fits the bill - a destined child comes into his powers, hunts for the hidden MacGuffin items within the given time limit, and the bad guys and good guys have it out frequently in major battle scenes that seem to be written to fit the inevitable video game spin-off. Like I said, you've seen it all before.Not that there's nothing worthwhile here. It's nice to see a strong and intelligent female guardian, somewhat modeled here after McGonagall from the ""Harry Potter"" movies, unless I miss my guess, and she's actually given a decent amount of screen time, pleasantly enough. It would be nice, for once, for movie parents to not be completely worthless piles of idiocy and brisk abrasiveness, but I'm a hopeless dreamer. If you just want something cheap and mindless to plop into your kids' laps, ""Seeker"" will fill the void after you've exhausted all the other children's' magical adventure movies, and I suppose the movie is better than the horrendously awful5 Children & It, but that's probably the faintest praise I've ever given in a review.~ Ana Mardoll",3,Seen it all before...,1250812800,"08 21, 2009",2009,2699,"['Seeker', '/', 'B000XUUQRE*Spoilers*There', 'lot', 'reviews', 'online', 'already', 'fans', 'book', 'series', 'movie', 'allegedly', 'based', 'upon', 'overall', 'consensus', 'be', 'Seeker', 'terrible', 'film', 'adaptation', 'wonderful', 'book', 'series', ""'re"", 'only', 'coming', 'movie', ""'re"", 'fan', 'book', 'should', 'give', 'miss', 'definitely', 'respect', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'series', 'yet', 'definitely', 'To-Do', 'list', 'so', 'review', 'will', 'be', 'movie', 'alone', 'consideration', 'adaptation', 'was', 'well', 'done.If', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'books', 'are', 'just', 'looking', 'something', 'mindless', 'wholesome', 'pass', 'evening', 'kids', 'Seeker', 'will', 'fit', 'bill', 'nothing', 'here', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before', 'ad', 'nauseum', 'first', 'viewing', 'Seeker', 'was', 'resounding', 'Eh', 'had', 'just', 'recently', 'had', 'socks', 'completely', 'blown', 'off', 'byThe', 'Spiderwick', 'Chronicles', 'thought', 'perhaps', 'unenthusiasm', 'Seeker', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'least', 'part', 'paled', 'comparison', 'Having', 'watched', 'again', 'recently', 'however', 'same', 'result', 'just', 'have', 'say', 'Seeker', 'tired', 'worn', 'overdone', 'point.There', 'be', 'kind', 'children', 'adventure', 'movie', 'boilerplate', 'Hollywood', 'stamped', 'book', 'series', 'gate', 'now', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'proved', 'wildly', 'successful', 'result', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'original', 'interesting', 'books', 'are', 'turned', 'sore-fest', 'MacGuffin', 'quests', 'saw', 'Golden', 'CompassandCity', 'Ember', 'example', 'really', 'countless', 'others', 'deserve', 'better', 'fate', 'Seeker', 'bill', 'destined', 'child', 'powers', 'hunts', 'hidden', 'MacGuffin', 'items', 'given', 'time', 'limit', 'bad', 'guys', 'good', 'guys', 'have', 'out', 'frequently', 'major', 'battle', 'scenes', 'seem', 'be', 'written', 'fit', 'inevitable', 'video', 'game', 'spin-off', 'said', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'before.Not', 'nothing', 'worthwhile', 'here', 'nice', 'see', 'strong', 'intelligent', 'female', 'guardian', 'somewhat', 'modeled', 'here', 'McGonagall', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'movies', 'miss', 'guess', 'actually', 'given', 'decent', 'amount', 'screen', 'time', 'pleasantly', 'enough', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'once', 'movie', 'parents', 'not', 'be', 'completely', 'worthless', 'piles', 'idiocy', 'brisk', 'abrasiveness', ""'m"", 'hopeless', 'dreamer', 'just', 'want', 'something', 'cheap', 'mindless', 'plop', 'kids', 'laps', 'Seeker', 'will', 'fill', 'void', ""'ve"", 'exhausted', 'other', 'children', 'magical', 'adventure', 'movies', 'suppose', 'movie', 'better', 'horrendously', 'awful5', 'Children', 'probably', 'faintest', 'praise', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'given', 'review.~', 'Ana', 'Mardoll']",The Seeker

The battles to and fro are not surprising and have little if any impact on the viewer.

1115509,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000XUUQRE,Chris Pandolfi,"[4, 6]","There have been more metaphors for light and dark than most would care to count, but ""The Seeker: The Dark is Rising"" is one of the few fantasy films to give them significance. Light and dark are treated as physical manifestations, and as you might expect, the former is helpful to humanity whereas the latter is harmful. But as interesting and original as this idea is, it requires an understandable and well-developed back-story in order to be effective. Herein lies the biggest problem: ""The Seeker"" does a wonderful job explaining itself, but absolutely nothing is established before the explanations are given. This is one of the most confusing fantasy films I've ever seen, telling a story that tries to be imaginative but fails to be understandable. To extend the metaphor, this film shoves us into a brightly lit room without letting our eyes adjust.It would be untrue to say that I disliked this film; more accurately, I didn't get it. I say this because, while I can certainly describe the plot, I cannot for the life of me explain its context. If the story simply happens without a set-up, if I don't have any way to understand why things are happening, then how am I supposed to invest in the characters or their circumstances? How can I engage the material and stay with it? The film opens promisingly enough, introducing the audience to Will Stanton (Alexander Ludwig), a teenager about to turn fourteen. He and his family have recently moved from America to England (which had something to do with his father's job, I think). One day, a mysterious rich man named Merriman Lyon (Ian McShane) gives him and his siblings an invitation to a Christmas party. It's a moment that's equally thoughtful and ominous, telling us that he has ulterior motives.And that's pretty much when the film starts piling on a series of magical occurrences. First, Will buys his sister, Gwen (Emma Lockhart), a necklace that emits strange visual signals; when two mall cops detain him under suspicion of shoplifting, they reveal themselves as being supernatural creatures. Will, fortunately, is able to escape. Shortly thereafter, an evil, menacing figure on horseback known only as The Rider (Christopher Eccleston) corners Will and orders him to give up The Sign. Naturally, Will has no idea what The Sign is. Fortunately, Lyon is on hand to explain everything; he and his companion, Miss Greythorne (Frances Conroy) are Old Ones--a.k.a., the defenders of The Light. Many centuries ago, a battle with The Dark split the power of The Light into six Signs of various elements (water, bronze, wood, etc.). In order to protect humanity, all six Signs must be gathered. However, the only one who can do that is The Seeker.This is where Will comes in. Unbeknownst to him until now, he is The Seeker, the seventh son of a seventh son. His destiny is to save us all from The Dark, which, as the film's title suggests, is rising. How exactly can he find The Signs? As it turns out, he has already found one--Gwen's necklace. But what about the other five Signs? Apparently, being a Seeker gives him special powers, most importantly the ability to move back and forth through time. This power is only brought on whenever he senses the presence of a Sign, all of which are conveniently located within the same town. It's said that the sixth Sign cannot be found because it isn't hidden, which makes sense, I guess. I won't reveal what this Sign is made of or where it's hidden, but I will say that it should come as no surprise, especially since this is a Hero's Journey.As if all this weren't confusing enough, an important yet undeveloped subplot involving Will's father, John (John Benjamin Hickey), is thrown into the mix. Many years ago, John's knowledge of physics drove him to find the secrets behind light and dark; he theorized that darkness was actually a physical thing, and that it was capable of being harmful. Unfortunately, a family tragedy (which I won't give away) prevented him from finishing his research. Will's attempts to engage his father are intertwined with another subplot, this one involving his older brother, Max (Gregory Smith). Max is a college student visiting his family for the Christmas holiday. Strange that he brought everything he owns back with him. Stranger still that The Rider approaches him for help.Yet another subplot finds its way into this story: a teenage girl named Maggie (Amelia Warner), who's introduced early in the film. Because her scarf is red, and because nearly every one of her shots was filmed in slow motion, we immediately guess that there's more to her than meets the eye. And we'd be right; when she reveals herself, she says that she was sent to protect Will and to ensure the safety to the Signs. This is exactly what Will wants to hear, considering the love struck way he stares at her. But if he wants to save the world, he has to ignore her and focus all his attention on The Signs. After all, he only has a finite number of days before The Rider's dark powers will reach their peak.It should be noted that this is based on Susan Cooper's ""The Dark is Rising,"" a novel that I haven't read, I'm sorry to admit. Maybe I should. If there were anything that could explain the events of this film, the source material would be it. ""The Seeker: The Dark is Rising"" is a film that gives answers when no questions are asked, which is both baffling and annoying. I do give it credit for being an incredibly good-looking film; David Lee's production design and Joel Ransom's cinematography are beautiful, giving the film a rich, colorful atmosphere. But the story gives us too much to absorb without any initial development. I guess you can say that all Signs point to disappointment.",3,The Signs Are All Around Us,1191974400,"10 10, 2007",2007,5725,"['have', 'been', 'more', 'metaphors', 'light', 'dark', 'most', 'would',

Will Stanton is from the generation before Harry Potter.  In the books, we can really feel the world and the matter of Wales, of ancient Britain, of the layers of history.

1115525,A3F3B6HY9RJI04,B000XUUQRE,James Duckett,"[8, 15]","This is the movie based on the fantasy series ""The Dark Is Rising"" by Susan Cooper, written over 30 years but modernized on the big screen (cell phones and iPods are prevalent from the beginning of the movie).The plot is pretty simple, it is the battle between good (the Light) and evil (the Dark) however the light and the dark appear to be physical weapons used to fight one another.  In the center of this battle is Will Stanton, a 14-year-old boy who is given the task of ""The Seeker"", one who is able to interpret visions in search of ""The Signs"", weapons the Light can use to battle the Dark.  The Dark is rising and he only has a few days to find the six signs in preparation of fighting The Dark.  In the meantime, he must also come to terms with many of the battles that every 14-year-old must go through (bigger brothers, puberty, emotions, the feeling that nobody cares of understands what you are going through, girls and more).When I saw the preview I thought this would be a movie that my son would love.  In fact, halfway through the movie my son did something I've never seen him do before... he tugged on my shirt and asked, ""Do you like this movie?""  I gave it my approval and he said, ""I love it!""  He was on the edge of his seat from beginning to end.  I would assume all boys aged 10 to about 16 will love this movie as it is simple to follow (despite what another reviewer said) and hits some of the issues of growing up that these kids are going through.Like I said earlier, this is based on a book series that I haven't picked up yet.  However, I think I might pick it up after enjoying this movie.  It may be a book series that my son and I can enjoy together.There were a few weaknesses of both the storyline and the cinematography of the film, but the strengths far outweighed the drawbacks and made for an enjoyable afternoon.

1115527,A1JJM6COMQOO4Y,B000XUUQRE,Jeff N,"[1, 2]","Dull mess with no magic that totally dishonors the book it came from and the author who wrote it!I didn't read the book, but my roommate did, and he said the same thing about The Seeker that people are saying on this and other sites...The director, writer, and producers of this movie didn't really follow the book at all, and definitely did Not improve on it.  In fact, they totally RUINED it!Since I didn't read the book, I will just comment on what I noticed is wrong with the film itself...The story is supposedly a battle between ""the Light"" and the dark. ""The Light"" itself is something that is hardly ever talked about in movies or TV shows, so I thought it would be very cool, but in this movie it is portrayed 100% wrong.  The one time the kid actually uses ""the Light"" all we see is a regular fire on the floor.  ""The Light"" is Not flames.  It is actually Light (yes, in another dimension, but actually Light), and they missed an opportunity to show how powerful it can be, and how people can use it to protect themselves and be guided by it, etc... but that's probably the point, isn't it?  The backers of Hollywood films allow the makers of the films to go so far with metaphysics, but to show people how to actually use the most powerful force in the Universe would be detrimental to their plans to control all of us.  The closest thing I have ever seen to actual ""Light"" (of the Holy Spirit) being used to protect anyone in a film, was the Patronus Charm in the Harry Potter movies. Not the spirit animals, but the great shield of ""Light.""  They don't call it The Light, but that is basically what it is, and I was totally amazed and in awe the first time Harry was able to do it.  That was real magic, because the ""Light"" is very real, and does guide and protect, etc...The boy in this movie has telekinetic abilities, but I have never seen that aspect of metaphysics handled WORSE than it was in this movie.  They missed a great opportunity to show his first discovery that he could move things with his mind, and then start to develop those abilities.  The movie Chronicle, for example, did an outstanding job of this.  It was really fascinating, and a truly great film.  In this dismal pointless mess, however, the very first time we see telekinesis happening, the boy is walking down some stairs, and a table knife starts moving around, they show the girl, and they show him, back and forth to the knife, the girl, the boy... And with completely wrong looks on both their faces, it is impossible to tell who is actually moving the knife.  He is such a BAD actor, that he doesn't even know how to look like he's focussing on moving a knife with his mind. And the director is so horribly awful that he obviously didn't give any guidance whatsoever to the kid.My roommate said that there are several Seeker books, but the way they left this movie, it's not even possible to do a sequel.I usually don't care for remakes and reboots, but THE SEEKER BOOKS NEED A HOLLYWOOD MOVIE REBOOT, WITH GOOD ACTORS AND A GREAT DIRECTOR.",1,"Great Potential, totally wasted on inexpensive effects, bad acting, terrible script, and horrible, awful directing!!",1370649600,"06 8, 2013",2013,3038,"['Dull', 'mess', 'magic', 'totally', 'book', 'came', 'author', 'who', 'wrote', 'did', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'roommate', 'did', 'said', 'same', 'thing', 'Seeker', 'people', 'are', 'saying', 'other', 'sites', 'director', 'writer', 'producers', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'follow', 'book', 'definitely', 'did', 'Not', 'improve', 'fact', 'totally', 'RUINED', 'did', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'will', 'just', 'comment', 'what', 'noticed', 'wrong', 'film', 'story', 'supposedly', 'battle', 'Light', 'dark', 'Light', 'something', 'hardly', 'ever', 'talked', 'movies', 'TV', 'shows', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'cool', 'movie', 'portrayed', '100', '%', 'wrong', 'one', 'time', 'kid', 'actually', 'Light', 'see', 'regular', 'fire', 'floor', 'Light', 'Not', 'flames', 'actually', 'Light', 'yes', 'dimension', 'actually', 'Light', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'show', 'how', 'powerful', 'can', 'be', 'how', 'people', 'can', 'use', 'protect', 'be', 'guided', 'etc', 'probably', 'point', ""n't"", 'backers', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'allow', 'makers', 'films', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'metaphysics', 'show', 'people', 'how', 'actually', 'use', 'most', 'powerful', 'force', 'Universe', 'would', 'be', 'detrimental', 'plans', 'control', 'closest', 'thing', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'actual', 'Light', 'Holy', 'Spirit', 'being', 'used', 'protect', 'anyone', 'film', 'was', 'Patronus', 'Charm', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'movies', 'Not', 'spirit', 'animals', 'great', 'shield', 'Light', 'do', ""n't"", 'call', 'Light', 'basically', 'what', 'was', 'totally', 'amazed', 'awe', 'first', 'time', 'Harry', 'was', 'able', 'do', 'was', 'real', 'magic', 'Light', 'very', 'real', 'guide', 'protect', 'etc', 'boy', 'movie', 'telekinetic', 'abilities', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'aspect', 'metaphysics', 'handled', 'WORSE', 'was', 'movie', 'missed', 'great', 'opportunity', 'show', 'first', 'discovery', 'could', 'move', 'things', 'mind', 'then', 'start', 'develop', 'abilities', 'movie', 'Chronicle', 'example', 'did', 'outstanding', 'job', 'was', 'really', 'fascinating', 'truly', 'great', 'film', 'dismal', 'pointless', 'mess', 'however', 'very', 'first', 'time', 'see', 'telekinesis', 'happening', 'boy', 'walking', 'down', 'stairs', 'table', 'knife', 'moving', 'around', 'show', 'girl', 'show', 'back', 'forth', 'knife', 'girl', 'boy', 'completely', 'wrong', 'looks', 'impossible', 'tell', 'who', 'actually', 'moving', 'knife', 'such', 'BAD', 'actor', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'how', 'look', 'focussing', 'moving', 'knife', 'mind', 'director', 'so', 'horribly', 'awful', 'obviously', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'guidance', 'whatsoever', 'kid.My', 'roommate', 'said', 'are', 'several', 'Seeker', 'books', 'way', 'left', 'movie', 'not', 'even', 'possible', 'do', 'sequel.I', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'remakes', 'reboots', 'THE', 'SEEKER', 'BOOKS', 'NEED', 'A', 'HOLLYWOOD', 'MOVIE', 'REBOOT', 'WITH', 'GOOD', 'ACTORS', 'A', 'GREAT', 'DIRECTOR']",The Seeker

So my perspective will be quite different from those whose opinions are based on a comparison to the book.  As a film, the visual elements are excellent with the floods, the signs and the spreading darkness over the world.  Alexander Ludwig does a nice job as Will Stanton, a modern boy completely unprepared for the age-old struggle thrust upon him.  Christopher Eccleston who was inThe Others (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)&Gone in 60 Secondshas a long range from the bookish real-world character to the mythical Rider, a stretch that wasn't altogether successful for me.  Frances Conroy who won a Golden Globe for TV's ""Six Feet Under"" plays Miss Greythorne as a bookish matron.  Ian McShane who was nominated for an Emmy for TV's ""Deadwood"" in 2005 is perhaps the hardest to figure out as Merriman Lyon.  His character seemed like it ought to have been more important, but somehow never quite got what it needed to make the point.  Wendy Crewson, who I loved as Evelyn Danvers inThe Covenant, plays Mary Stanton with a nice but brief touch.  Amelia Warner who was in ""Aeon Flux"" makes an impression as the witch Maggie Barnes.  The film breezes by and looks handsome.  It comes across as a rushed Harry Potter.  Overall, it's entertaining.

1115538,A3SYT3JC9VH5UZ,B000XUUQRE,Marina Michaels,"[9, 10]","I have read and re-read Susan Cooper's ""The Dark is Rising"" many times since I first discovered it in the late 1970s. It is a wonderful book, one of my top ten all-time favorites, and so is the series. This movie is only very loosely based on the book, and is, in and of itself, a bad movie whether you have read the book or not.If you have read the book, you will be horrified at how many needless changes were made to the plot and characters.If you have not read the book, you will be confused because you won't know what is really going on.I never expect a movie version fo a book to follow the book exactly, but it should at least keep the important aspects of a story. This movie does not. It tears away many of the very best things of the book, and alters what little is left so badly that it darkens the story where there should have been light (such as in the relationships among the Stanton children).It doesn't help that, despite some excellent actors, everyone was miscast, and some of the most important characters (Will and Merriman especially) are made into such horrible characters that one might weep at the wreckage.The worst thing is that, after seeing this movie, people who have never read the book might avoid it, thinking it is as chaotic, confusing, and unsatisfactory as the movie. The book, and the other books in the series, are well worth reading no matter what your age.Plot summary: The basic story is that of Will, a boy who comes into his spiritual inheritance as being the last-born of the ""Old Ones,"" mysterious guardians who have been shepherding and aiding humanity in its fight against the Dark (the powers of evil) for millenia. When an Old One is born, he or she does not remember being an Old One. Old Ones must be reminded of their true natures by reading a magical book on or shortly after their 11th birthday (the age is changed to 14 in the movie). That is one of the tasks Will must accomplish in this story.Another task is for Will to retrieve six signs of power that can be used to help fight against the Dark. He needs to move through time to accomplish his tasks. In the book, the six signs are actual physical objects; in the movie, one of the horrible changes made is that the sixth sign is Will himself (I am not spoiling anything here--you know that this is so as soon as they say, ""the sixth sign isn't hidden"").Of course, the agents of the Dark do all within their power to stop Will from remembering who he truly is and from recovering all six signs.That's the gist of both the book and the movie. This summary does not convey how evocative and magical Ms. Coooper's book is, and how very much the opposite the movie is. Will especially is made into such an unlikable character--pouty, bratty, sullen, and, when he gets his powers, ready to flaunt them and throw his weight around with them instead of handling them wisely as even a young Old One would do--that I wonder how anyone can like him or care much for what happens to him.If you have not watched this movie, don't. Instead, buy Ms. Cooper's books and give yourself some highly enjoyable hours of reading.The Dark Is Rising (Boxed Set): The Dark Is Rising, Greenwitch, Over Sea, Under Stone, Silver on the Tree, The Grey King",2,Tragic mangling of a great book,1207094400,"04 2, 2008",2008,3239,"['have', 'read', 're-read', 'Susan', 'Cooper', 'Dark', 'Rising', 'many', 'times', 'first', 'discovered', 'late', '1970s', 'wonderful', 'book', 'one', 'top', 'ten', 'all-time', 'favorites', 'so', 'series', 'movie', 'only', 'very', 'loosely', 'based', 'book', 'bad', 'movie', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'not.If', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'will', 'be', 'horrified', 'how', 'many', 'needless', 'changes', 'were', 'made', 'plot', 'characters.If', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'will', 'be', 'confused', 'wo', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'never', 'expect', 'movie', 'version', 'fo', 'book', 'follow', 'book', 'exactly', 'should', 'least', 'keep', 'important', 'aspects', 'story', 'movie', 'not', 'away', 'many', 'very', 'best', 'things', 'book', 'alters', 'what', 'little', 'left', 'so', 'badly', 'story', 'where', 'there', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'light', 'such', 'relationships', 'Stanton', 'children', '.It', ""n't"", 'help', 'excellent', 'actors', 'everyone', 'was', 'miscast', 'most', 'important', 'characters', 'Will', 'Merriman', 'especially', 'are', 'made', 'such', 'horrible', 'characters', 'one', 'might', 'weep', 'wreckage.The', 'worst', 'thing', 'seeing', 'movie', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'read', 'book', 'might', 'avoid', 'thinking', 'chaotic', 'confusing', 'unsatisfactory', 'movie', 'book', 'other', 'books', 'series', 'are', 'well', 'reading', 'matter', 'what', 'age.Plot', 'summary', 'basic', 'story', 'Will', 'boy', 'who', 'spiritual', 'inheritance', 'being', 'last-born', 'Old', 'Ones', 'mysterious', 'guardians', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'shepherding', 'aiding', 'humanity', 'fight', 'Dark', 'powers', 'evil', 'millenia', 'When', 'Old', 'One', 'born', 'not', 'remember', 'being', 'Old', 'One', 'Ones', 'must', 'be', 'reminded', 'true', 'natures', 'reading', 'magical', 'book', 'shortly', '11th', 'birthday', 'age', 'changed', '14', 'movie', 'one', 'tasks', 'Will', 'must', 'accomplish', 'story.Another', 'task', 'Will', 'retrieve', 'six', 'signs', 'power', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'help', 'fight', 'Dark', 'move', 'time', 'accomplish', 'tasks', 'book', 'six', 'signs', 'are', 'actual', 'physical', 'objects', 'movie', 'one', 'horrible', 'changes', 'made', 'sixth', 'sign', 'Will', 'am', 'not', 'spoiling', 'anything', 'here', 'know', 'so', 'as', 'soon', 'say', 'sixth', 'sign', ""n't"", 'hidden', '.Of', 'course', 'agents', 'Dark', 'do', 'power', 'stop', 'Will', 'remembering', 'who', 'truly', 'recovering', 'six', 'gist', 'book', 'movie', 'summary', 'not', 'convey', 'how', 'evocative', 'magical', 'Ms.', 'Coooper', 'book', 'how', 'very', 'much', 'opposite', 'movie', 'Will', 'especially', 'made', 'such', 'unlikable', 'character', 'pouty', 'bratty', 'sullen', 'when', 'powers', 'ready', 'flaunt', 'throw', 'weight', 'instead', 'handling', 'wisely', 'even', 'young', 'Old', 'One', 'would', 'do', 'wonder', 'how', 'anyone', 'can', 'like', 'care', 'much', 'what', 'him.If', 'have', 'not', 'watched', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'Instead', 'buy', 'Ms.', 'Cooper', 'books', 'give', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'hours', 'reading.The', 'Dark', 'Rising', 'Boxed', 'Set', 'Dark', 'Is', 'Rising', 'Greenwitch', 'Over', 'Sea', 'Stone', 'Silver', 'Tree', 'Grey', 'King']",The Seeker

1115552,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B000XUUQRE,Robert Badgley,"[0, 1]","The Seeker(released Oct/07)is a nice adaption of one of the books from the Dark is Rising series by Susan Cooper.The film stars a young Canadian actor in the lead role of Will Stanton,Alexander Ludwig,who acquits himself quite well in his role.Accompanying him,among many others,is his dark nemesis Chris Eccleston,more famous for his Dr Who role and the always affable and multi talented Ian McShane,actor/director extraordinaire,as Merriman Lyon,one of Will's protectors.The plot finds Will coming into his 14th year in England.He is the 7th son of a 7th son,and his father,mother,five brothers and one sister have moved to England,where they live in a large house in a small English town.However as his birthday comes and passes strange things start to happen:swarms of crows pester him at a bus stop,he gets picked up by security guards at a mall for shop lifting and he ends up fleeing from them as they ""turn"",two men in the village seem to know Will quite well,which isn't possible,or is it?,and other just as strange incidents.Will and his family attend,by invitation,a Christmas get together hosted by a local dowager at her English manor.While at the party a slightly older girl,but one whom he been smitten with,also arrives there.There she gives him the eyes,but it is one of his older brothers that walks away with her.Will goes outside,frustrated,then is chased down by two dark dogs and a man on a horse.The horseman tells him he wants the sign,and that if he doesn't give it to him a great darkness will descend upon the Earth in just five days.Suddenly the dowager,her man servant Merriman and the two men who knew him but whom he did not,appear and frighten the man off.They take him for a walk through time and explain as of his recent birthday,he has come of age.He is a seeker who must seek out all six signs in order to save the Earth from destruction.The film from this point escalates little by little as time runs ever shorter and Will's quest to find each succeeding sign is fraught with extreme dangers.Of course the horseman dogs his every step trying to thwart his attempts at finding the signs,and even employes helpers to distract and aid him in getting the signs.But find them he does,or almost.The final confrontation comes in an old church where the horseman seems to have the upper hand,as the final sign is not seemingly within Will's grasp.All his protectors cannot save him as the darkness takes them away. As it inevitably takes Will away also,Will finally realizes the final sign is within him.He fights back and returns to the church to finally put the horseman to ""bed"".The film ends as Will and the twin brother he never knew(taken by the darkness years before),return home together.The story is certainly a compelling one,the acting is right on,the script and pace are well done and the cinematography is top notch.The editing/plotline also keeps you guessing constantly throughout as to who might be working with the horseman,who is working with or against whom,who really knows more than they're telling,etc,etc.For all its nice special effects it is,above all,a well done mystery movie that will keep you absorbed from beginning to end.Technically speaking this film is clear and crisp and is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1,along with it' full frame cousin on the flip side,i.e a dreaded double sided disc.Be careful not to scuff or scratch.There are no extras at all.All in all a nice film about innocence come of age,who is thrust into circumstances beyond his control and is forced to push the envelope farther than he ever expected he would ever have to,to overcome overwhelming odds.Above all,and take note,there is not one WORD of swearing or off coloured humour in this film.This is a FAMILY FILM from top to bottom,and as such,gets an extra notch up in my books.They are so rare these days,that when one comes along like this of such good quality,it deserves all the backing one can give it.Recommended.",4,"Keep the Faith,baby!",1345939200,"08 26,

But soon it's drowning in testosterone-driven action; the pugilistic teenage male characters and their 'toughness' quickly dominate the story, overpowering the mystery and wonderment of otherwise good fantasy. This is not by any stretch anywhere near Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter!Action and special effects in The Seeker appeared just thrown-together -- spoiler alert -- giving the film's middle and end sections a wildly chaotic look.

1115559,A3PL67IRKI2NW9,B000XUUQRE,Shi-doh!,"[4, 6]","There was definitely some talent involved in the making of this film.  A lot of the camera work is very creative, unusual angles are effectively used in many scenes (including brief cuts with it being upside down that are subtle enough not to be easily noticed!).However, the creativity seemed to run short in a lot of ways.  A lot of the shots of the 'rider' were slightly reminiscent of the Nazgul in the Lord of the Rings, particularly the times when he is mounted.  Additionally, while the style used to establish the mood around the 'rider' was effective in the beginning, it did not vary much over the course of the movie, and thus began to feel stale by the end.  The director also could not seem to resist the urge to slow down action shots in 'Matrix' style.As for the acting, Alexander Ludwig does a good job as Will Stanton.  Christopher Eccleston is a very talented actor, and seems to be holding back in this movie, somehow, or not quite on his game, which is rather disappointing (maybe he dislikes Romania).Now, the biggie: the story.  All in all, I have to rate this by far as one of the weakest book adaptations that I have seen (ok, the Scifi Channel adaptation of 'A Wizard of Earthsea' was FAR worse).  That does not mean it is a terrible movie though.  The book is of a high enough quality that even this watered down, very loose adaptation of it still has some merit.What is difficult for me to understand though is that the novel was saturated with the myths and traditions of the british isles, and that whole feeling is entirely removed from the movie.  Some have suggested that this was because the director felt these were in opposition to his Christian beliefs (which seems odd as King Arthur is universally portrayed as a Christian).  The signs were originally all in the shape of celtic crosses, for instance, and the last great battle which the movie places as '1000 years ago' was, in the book, the battle of baden hill with King Arthur (and Merriman Lyon actually being Merlin), etc. This is all removed, and the movie could just as easily have taken place in Romania, where they filmed it.The biggest problem that I had though is that instead of him being part of something bigger than himself in the battle against the dark, this telling of it has the other 'Old Ones' have to resort to cross bows and swords, because they seem to have virtually no power of their own.  Not only does this lack literary sense, it also has the effect of making much of the movie feel like a superhero-worship film, instead of an epic, large scale battle which is much more.  Will becomes this embodiment of light, placed opposite the 'rider', who was the embodiment of the dark.  This one-on-one situation might appeal to modern movie audiences, but just serves to be reductionist and effectively VASTLY limits both what the light and the dark are.The sub-plot about his father being a physicist who had studied the actual nature of light and dark struck me as a total non-sequitur, which did little to nothing to enhance the story and just sucked up time which should have been used in more meaningful character development.Another sore thumb is that members of his family get carried on his time journeys with him, and he doesn't just wipe their memory (a power old ones have in the book) afterwards.  Aside from being weirded out at the moment, the subject never comes up again as it would in reality.The ending was particuarly painful. What was, in the past, an epic battle between light and dark which the light barely won, was a quick and trite utter dominion of the dark by will (without the aid of any of the other old ones, annoyingly enough).

Living in London with his American family, 14-year-old Will Stanton (Ludwig) is living the normal life of a teenager: likes a girl but can't get up the courage to talk to her, annoying older brothers, distant father - the usual. However, Will is anything but normal as Merriman Lyon (McShane) hastens to tell him: he is in fact The Seeker, one of the last immortal Warriors of Light (and there was me thinking it was Pete Townshend). The Seeker must find six 'signs' that are scattered throughout time, and defeat the forces of Dark, led by The Rider (Eccleston). If it sounds like a Buffy-meets-Harry Potter rip-off, you'd be right - but as rip-offs go, it's not half bad. Adapted from Susan Cooper's novel, The Dark Is Rising is another kiddie movie that refuses to talk down to its audience (remember The Last Mimzy and Bridge To Terabithia?) and has a style not usually seen in fantasies geared towards youngsters. Cunningham delivers some nice touches throughout and isn't afraid to creep out the kids with some dark scenes (the one involving snakes can be a bit much).

1115565,A1MU6C107VLAQN,B000XUUQRE,"Tarot ""-Tarot""","[2, 17]","Do Not Read this unless you've seen the film AND read the book ...Massive spoilers!!!!I've seen this movie 9 times thus far and I plan to buy the DVD.  How many times I'll see it in all, I'm not certain, but I've really enjoyed it.  The film went by quickly without being rushed, but there is still a lot to cover, so I shall, as usual for my reviews, touch upon what got my attention.Will Stanton- very believable an for any who complain ""it's not realistic"" all I have to say is, ""How would you react if you were a 14 year old who suddenly discovered magic powers and massive responsibility?""  Any who were able to empathize with Harry Potter will easily be able to empathize with Will.  Alexander Ludwig does a fine job as the film's hero.The Rider- Christopher Eccleston is amazing! (as always)  Evil should not look that good.  Chris is as gorgeous and captivating as ever while still very very dark.  He works very well with Rusty and, despite that I know what Chris said in interviews, between what skill he's acquired and Rusty, Chris looks very much like a very experienced rider!(And no, Chris, you don't look like Popeye in your close ups!)I like the fact that when the Rider is in disguise as the ""doctor"" he tries to make Will an offer in addition to just scaring and threatening him.""I don't forget those who stand with me, nor those who stand against ... """"These old fools would have you do work that they can't, but they haven't told you that you'll fail.""I'm sure these thoughts crossed Will's mind, especially given that he still thought he was only the 6th son of a 7th son at this point.Yes, I know the Rider is evil, but he's still captivating.(First pigeons now ravens, I have to wonder what's next in this sequence)Maggie Barnes- interesting how it's not Max she winds up with but James, and how all the Stanton boys seem to admire her.  And she is still an agent of the Dark.Max- he strikes me as subbing in for the Walker a bit.  He gets used as a pawn by the Dark.  It was clear something was up when he returned home from college unexpectedly.Changes from book to film:Tom- now Will's lost twin rather than a much older brother and he's not dead! That was a nice twist.Gwen- Will only has one sister and she's younger.  They had a clear bond onscreen.  I think maybe this change was made to clear up any 7th son of a 7th son confusion.  I'm not certain how this works but what I have read about, it's always been an unbroken line of boys, with no girl births in between.  It may not matter in actuality or in the original legends.The Lady seems to be combined with Ms. Greythorne.The Walker is missing but with the Signs being hidden differently as well as a different set up for the Book, he was not needed.The Stantons are now an American family with English ancestry, and I'm not certain why this change was made.  Will's dad is now John Stanton a Physics professor rather than Roger Stanton the jeweler.  The name change puzzles me but the physics tie in was an interesting addition.Instead of Mr. Mitothin, the diamond dealer, we get a local doctor for the Rider to disguise himself as.  I love how Will recognizes him anyway and is still scared of him.  I also like the fact that he acts so benign around Will's mom.  Chris looked like he was having a blast with this part of the role.The attic is now a place of semi-exile rather than a prized sanctuary.  It's almost a metaphor for what Will is going through.  He's part of a family, yet so different from them.  He's an Old One but the youngest one.The signs are no longer simple quartered circles and I wonder if the art department was having fun.  I'm not certain what to make of the final sign being Will's own soul and I wonder how exactly that works.The Rider's horse is now white rather than black.  Rusty is awesome!  I also think this may be a reference to the myth/legend that ""Death rides a pale horse.""Herne the Hunter and the Wild Hunt is not there nor is either mentioned.  Without Herne, there was no need for the mask or the White Mare.  Granted I know who Herne is, but I didn't learn much about him until College (University), and I'm still learning.  Without the Hunt to chase him away, Will trapped the Rider in a sphere, much as Tom had been.(I so gotta find that sphere!)The Seeker: The Dark is Rising",5,Seeking the Dark...,1201046400,"01 23, 2008",2008,4308,"['Do', 'Not', 'Read', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'read', 'book', 'Massive', 'spoilers', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', '9', 'times', 'thus', 'far', 'plan', 'buy', 'DVD', 'How', 'many', 'times', ""'ll"", 'see', ""'m"", 'not', 'certain', ""'ve"", 'really', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'went', 'quickly', 'being', 'rushed', 'still', 'lot', 'cover', 'shall', 'usual', 'reviews', 'touch', 'what', 'got', 'attention.Will', 'Stanton-', 'very', 'believable', 'who', 'complain', 'not', 'realistic', 'have', 'say', 'How', 'would', 'react', 'were', '14', 'year', 'old', 'who', 'suddenly', 'discovered', 'magic', 'powers', 'massive', 'responsibility', 'Any', 'who', 'were', 'able', 'empathize', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'will', 'easily', 'be', 'able', 'empathize', 'Will', 'Alexander', 'Ludwig', 'fine', 'job', 'film', 'hero.The', 'Rider-', 'Christopher', 'Eccleston', 'amazing', 'always', 'Evil', 'should', 'not', 'look', 'good', 'Chris', 'as', 'gorgeous', 'captivating', 'ever', 'still', 'very', 'very', 'dark', 'very', 'well', 'Rusty', 'know', 'what', 'Chris', 'said', 'interviews', 'what', 'skill', 'acquired', 'Rusty', 'Chris', 'very', 'much', 'very', 'experienced', 'rider', 'Chris', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'Popeye', 'close', 'ups', 'like', 'fact', 'when', 'Rider', 'disguise', 'doctor', 'make', 'Will', 'offer', 'addition', 'just', 'scaring', 'threatening', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'who', 'stand', 'who', 'stand', 'old', 'fools', 'would', 'have', 'do', 'work', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', ""n't"", 'told', ""'ll"", 'fail', ""'m"", 'sure', 'thoughts', 'crossed', 'Will', 'mind', 'especially', 'given', 'still', 'thought', 'was', 'only', '6th', 'son', '7th', 'son', 'point.Yes', 'know', 'Rider', 'evil', 'still', 'captivating', 'First', 'pigeons', 'now', 'have', 'wonder', 'what', 'next', 'sequence', 'Maggie', 'Barnes-', 'interesting', 'how', 'not', 'Max', 'up', 'James', 'how', 'Stanton', 'seem', 'admire', 'still', 'agent', 'Dark.Max-', 'subbing', 'Walker', 'bit', 'used', 'pawn', 'Dark', 'was', 'clear', 'something', 'was', 'up', 'when', 'returned', 'home', 'college', 'unexpectedly.Changes', 'book', 'film', 'Tom-', 'now', 'Will', 'lost', 'twin', 'rather', 'much', 'older', 'brother', 'not', 'dead', 'was', 'nice', 'twist.Gwen-', 'Will', 'only', 'one', 'sister', 'younger', 'had', 'clear', 'bond', 'onscreen', 'think', 'maybe', 'change', 'was', 'made', 'clear', 'up', '7th', 'son', '7th', 'son', 'confusion', ""'m"", 'not', 'certain', 'how', 'what', 'have', 'read', 'always', 'been', 'unbroken', 'line', 'boys', 'girl', 'births', 'may', 'not', 'matter', 'actuality', 'original', 'legends.The', 'Lady', 'be', 'combined', 'Ms.', 'Greythorne.The', 'Walker', 'missing', 'Signs', 'being', 'hidden', 'differently', 'as', 'well', 'different', 'set', 'up', 'Book', 'was', 'not', 'needed.The', 'Stantons', 'are', 'now', 'American', 'family', 'English', 'ancestry', ""'m"", 'not', 'certain', 'why', 'change', 'was', 'made', 'Will', 'dad', 'now', 'John', 'Stanton', 'Physics', 'professor', 'rather', 'Roger', 'Stanton', 'jeweler', 'name', 'change', 'puzzles', 'physics', 'tie', 'was', 'interesting', 'addition.Instead', 'Mr.', 'Mitothin', 'diamond', 'dealer', 'get', 'local', 'doctor', 'Rider', 'disguise', 'love', 'how', 'Will', 'anyway', 'still', 'scared', 'also', 'fact', 'so', 'benign', 'around', 'Will', 'mom', 'Chris', 'looked', 'was', 'having', 'blast', 'part', 'role.The', 'attic', 'now', 'place', 'semi-exile', 'rather', 'prized', 'sanctuary', 'almost', 'metaphor', 'what', 'Will', 'going', 'part', 'family', 'yet', 'so', 'different', 'Old', 'One', 'youngest', 'one.The', 'signs', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'simple', 'quartered', 'circles', 'wonder', 'art', 'department', 'was', 'having', 'fun', ""'m"", 'not', 'certain', 'what', 'make', 'final', 'sign', 'being', 'Will', 'own', 'soul', 'wonder', 'how', 'exactly', 'works.The', 'Rider', 'horse', 'now', 'white', 'rather', 'black', 'Rusty', 'awesome', 'also', 'think', 'may', 'be', 'reference', 'myth/legend', 'Death', 'pale', 'horse', 'Herne', 'Hunter', 'Wild', 'Hunt', 'not', 'mentioned', 'Herne', 'was', 'need', 'mask', 'White', 'Mare', 'Granted', 'know', 'who', 'Herne', 'did', ""n't"", 'learn', 'much', 'College', 'University', ""'m"", 'still', 'learning', 'Hunt', 'chase', 'away', 'Will', 'trapped', 'Rider', 'sphere', 'much', 'Tom', 'had', 'been', 'so', 'got', 'ta', 'find', 'sphere', 'Seeker', 'Dark', 'Rising']",The Seeker

1115569,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000XUUQRE,Tsuyoshi,"[5, 6]","First I must confess that I haven't read Susan Cooper's original book. After watching the film which I find disappointing, I thought I might have missed something, so I surfed the net and found the reviews by avid fans complaining about the changes done to the source material. But even if you don't know these changes, you will realize that though the film includes the right elements that would make a great fantasy world, there is something missing in the film version of ""The Seeker: The Dark is Rising."" In short, it lacks thrills and imagination.A 14-year-old American boy Will Stanton (Alexander Ludwig), now living in England with his family, learns that he is a ""chosen"" one, ""The Seeker."" Will is told by ""The Old Ones"" that only he can obtain the ""Signs"" that would save the world from the force of ""The Dark"" (personified by Christopher Eccleston riding a horse). It takes a bit too long for the film to reach where we are informed about this (and we are not quite sure why an American boy, not British), but so far, the film is not bad.Things start to get worse from there, however. We are told that Will is ""The Seeker,"" but actually he doesn't seek the Signs. As one reviewer on IMDb rightly said, he ""stumbles on"" them. Then Will is automatically sent to another time and collects the Signs one after another, but watching the process is not very exciting because he has little to do during that and the back story about each time and place is missing.Probably we need much more time to develop the storyline to make it fully engaging. Will has to find six artifacts in mere 94 minutes and the film also attempts to include the subplots about Will's possible love interest (beautiful Amelia Warner), Will's brother, Will's father and his research. There is virtually no room to breathe, for either characters or audiences, and each action has to be done quickly. This kind of problem is not what you can solve by changing the camera angle or using special effects (effects are excellent, I admit).I can point out other defects in the script, but the greatest letdown is that the film's script refuses to give Will chances to overcome the obstacles by himself. In fantasy world boys (and girls) must learn something; Harry, Frodo, or four kids Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy, they all learn something. Will doesn't, or it looks like that, and this is not definitely what the original book is written for.",2,Fantasy World and Adventure Story That Should Be More Thrilling,1200096000,"01 12, 2008",2008,2419,"['First', 'must', 'confess', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'Susan', 'Cooper', 'original', 'book', 'watching', 'film', 'find', 'disappointing', 'thought', 'might', 'have', 'missed', 'something', 'surfed', 'net', 'found', 'reviews', 'avid', 'fans', 'complaining', 'changes', 'done', 'source', 'material', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'changes', 'will', 'realize', 'film', 'right', 'elements', 'would', 'make', 'great', 'fantasy', 'world', 'something', 'missing', 'film', 'version', 'Seeker', 'Dark', 'Rising', 'short', 'thrills', 'imagination.A', '14-year-old', 'American', 'boy', 'Will', 'Stanton', 'Alexander', 'Ludwig', 'now', 'living', 'England', 'family', 'chosen', 'one', 'Seeker', 'Will', 'told', 'Old', 'Ones', 'only', 'can', 'obtain', 'Signs', 'would', 'save', 'world', 'force', 'Dark', 'personified', 'Christopher', 'Eccleston', 'riding', 'horse', 'bit', 'too', 'long', 'film', 'reach', 'where', 'are', 'informed', 'are', 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'why', 'American', 'boy', 'not', 'British', 'so', 'far', 'film', 'not', 'bad.Things', 'start', 'get', 'worse', 'there', 'however', 'are', 'told', 'Will', 'Seeker', 'actually', ""n't"", 'seek', 'Signs', 'one', 'reviewer', 'IMDb', 'rightly', 'said', 'stumbles', 'Then', 'Will', 'automatically', 'sent', 'time', 'Signs', 'one', 'watching', 'process', 'not', 'very', 'exciting', 'little', 'do', 'back', 'story', 'time', 'place', 'missing.Probably', 'need', 'much', 'more', 'time', 'develop', 'storyline', 'make', 'fully', 'engaging', 'Will', 'find', 'six', 'artifacts', 'mere', '94', 'minutes', 'film', 'also', 'include', 'subplots', 'Will', 'possible', 'love', 'interest', 'beautiful', 'Amelia', 'Warner', 'Will', 'brother', 'Will', 'father', 'research', 'virtually', 'room', 'breathe', 'characters', 'audiences', 'action', 'be', 'done', 'quickly', 'kind', 'problem', 'not', 'what', 'can', 'solve', 'changing', 'camera', 'angle', 'using', 'special', 'effects', 'effects', 'are', 'excellent', 'admit', '.I', 'can', 'point', 'out', 'other', 'defects', 'script', 'greatest', 'letdown', 'film', 'script', 'give', 'Will', 'chances', 'overcome', 'obstacles', 'fantasy', 'world', 'boys', 'girls', 'must', 'learn', 'something', 'Harry', 'Frodo', 'four', 'kids', 'Peter', 'Susan', 'Edmund', 'Lucy', 'learn', 'something', 'Will', ""n't"", 'not', 'definitely', 'what', 'original', 'book', 'written']",The Seeker
1115570,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B000XUUQRE,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[8, 10]","THE SEEKER revolves around an American boy named Will Stanton (Alexander Ludwig).  Will and his family are transplants currently living in England.  On his birthday Will discovers that he is the last of a group of immortal warriors of Light, the ""Old Ones"".  The Old Ones have supernatural abilities, including the power to travel through time and space, and are engaged in a long-time struggle against the forces of Dark.  Will is a special Old One, not only because he is the last Old One, but because he is also the Seeker--the person chosen to seek and find six Signs of Power (in the shape of a circle with a cross).  When united the signs form a great weapon to fight the Dark.  Will, however, only has a few days to find and united the Signs before the Dark Rider (Christopher Eccleston) and his minions reach the height of their power and will be able to overcome and withstand even the power of the united Signs.THE SEEKER is based upon Susan Cooper's beloved novel, THE DARK IS RISING.  However, other than a few names, locations, and sparse plot outline, THE SEEKER has no semblance to THE DARK IS RISING.  For example, Will is turned from a British boy into an American, the character of the Walker is erased, and there is no hunt.  I'm a huge fan of Susan Cooper's stories and when I learned about THE SEEKER, I was quite excited about it, but I was extremely disappointed by the movie adaptation.  That's not to say the movie is terrible, because it's not.  It is a decent escapist fantasy flick that, as a movie, isn't too bad.  It is, however, a very, very,  poor adaptation of the story it is based upon.  All of the Celtic mythology, sense of magic, and powerful spiritualism that are such an integral part of Cooper's novel have been eliminated.  The result is a decent fantasy movie that's entertaining to watch, but that fails to spark the imagination or encourage the heart and doesn't have much spirit.",3,Average Fantasy Yarn But a Very  Poor Adaptation,1201478400,"01 28, 2008",2008,1925,"['SEEKER', 'around', 'American', 'boy', 'named', 'Will', 'Stanton', 'Alexander', 'Ludwig', 'Will', 'family', 'are', 'transplants', 'currently', 'living', 'England', 'birthday', 'Will', 'last', 'group', 'immortal', 'warriors', 'Light', 'Old', 'Ones', 'Old', 'Ones', 'have', 'supernatural', 'abilities', 'including', 'power', 'travel', 'time', 'space', 'are', 'engaged', 'long-time', 'struggle', 'forces', 'Dark', 'Will', 'special', 'Old', 'One', 'not', 'only', 'last', 'Old', 'One', 'also', 'Seeker', 'person', 'chosen', 'seek', 'find', 'six', 'Signs', 'Power', 'shape', 'circle', 'cross', 'When', 'united', 'signs', 'form', 'great', 'weapon', 'fight', 'Dark', 'Will', 'however', 'only', 'few', 'days', 'find', 'united', 'Signs', 'Dark', 'Rider', 'Christopher', 'Eccleston', 'minions', 'reach', 'height', 'power', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'overcome', 'withstand', 'even', 'power', 'united', 'Signs.THE', 'SEEKER', 'based', 'Susan', 'Cooper', 'beloved', 'novel', 'THE', 'DARK', 'IS', 'RISING', 'However', 'other', 'few', 'names', 'locations', 'sparse', 'plot', 'outline', 'THE', 'SEEKER', 'semblance', 'THE', 'DARK', 'IS', 'RISING', 'example', 'Will', 'turned', 'British', 'boy', 'American', 'character', 'Walker', 'erased', 'hunt', ""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'Susan', 'Cooper', 'stories', 'when', 'learned', 'THE', 'SEEKER', 'was', 'quite', 'excited', 'was', 'extremely', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'not', 'say', 'movie', 'terrible', 'not', 'decent', 'escapist', 'fantasy', 'flick', 'movie', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'however', 'very', 'very', 'poor', 'adaptation', 'story', 'based', 'Celtic', 'mythology', 'sense', 'magic', 'powerful', 'spiritualism', 'are', 'integral', 'part', 'Cooper', 'novel', 'have', 'been', 'eliminated', 'result', 'decent', 'fantasy', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'spark', 'imagination', 'encourage', 'heart', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'spirit']",The Seeker

He is to be the one to save earth from an ancient darkness, come to new life. None of this fits his idea of his fourteen-year old self. He has only five older brothers and, as he says, ""I don't even know how to talk to a girl.""It turns out that there was another brother, his older twin, who mysteriously vanished years ago. Will's distraught parents couldn't bring themselves to say the lost boy's name, preferring the numbness of forgetting. It also turns out that talking to girls, in his case, might not be a great idea - at least, not yet.So, the quest is on for the Mystic Thingies (which he finds in the nick of time) and the world is saved. ""Seeker"" is a pleasant bit of fluff. The child and teen actors are suitably cute, especially Will's little sister. The mystical guardians are suitably sinister, and the good guys win.
