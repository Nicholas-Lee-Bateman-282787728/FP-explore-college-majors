The performances are moving and beautiful, and at the same time haunting.  Alexie directed this like a composer would a beautiful, tragic suite.  I found myself laughing and crying, and also thinking about the universal concept of identity while watching this film.  It doesn't matter if you are from the Rez, or from NYC.  Returning to your home after breaking away is hard for all of us--especially if rejection is inevitable.I think this is definitely a groundbreaking film.  I don't say this simply because Alexie is a Native writer, filmmaker, producer and director.  I say this because the film is a brilliant examination of the human condition, done in an unaffected, realistic and straightforward way.  What are we left with when we stand at the crossroads between two identities and cultures?

752023,AQSQLWD3NLMAS,B0000950WI,Glenn A. Buttkus,"[3, 5]","Northwest author, director, poet, producer, activist, and humorist Sherman Alexie gathered a group of his friends together and they ""made a movie"" or they almost did. Falling a little short of the mark of a polished and finished film, nevertheless this movie gives us a series of tableaus that are both striking and emotionally charged, challenging us to ""understand"" our Indian brothers. This lovely and sad picture tackles many of Alexie's favorite themes, like life on the Rez, substance abuse, racism, native heritage and coveting of the ""old ways"", a child's eye view of parental alcoholism, struggle for meaning in an ignorant and non-caring world, and the driving need some Indians have to return to the Rez, to ""make a difference"", juxtaposed to the pulsating need others have to stay away, to build new lives amongst the white eyes; and something new -sexuality.Evan Adams, long identified as Thomas Builds-the-Fire from that excellent Alexie adaptation, SMOKE SIGNALS (1998), stretched his creative impulses to portray Seymour Polatkin -who was a very successful gay poet,  and who happened to live with a paleface ""life partner"". ""In the before time,"" Seymour tells his book store audience, ""Homosexuals were completely accepted by other Indians, treated as special, like the crazy ones, or the disabled; cherished and protected. Homophobia was something Indians had to learn from the white men."" That, I suppose, and firewater. Evans, as an actor, is right up front about his own homosexuality, so the character of Seymour is an interesting mix if Alexie and himself; heartfelt and accurate, like a sound thump between the eyes.Alexie has been criticized for ""revealing"" too much angst, pain, and sorrow relative to his kin's alcoholism, and his own -illuminating the substance abuse that runs rabid and rampant through all of the Indian nations. His character in FANCYDANCING, Mouse, dies of an overdose. He contends that he is simply writing from his actual experience, from his life -that he ""speaks the whole truth"" regardless of the literary and symbolic consequences. I support and would defend his artistic license for introspection. Reading his poetry, novels, essays, and narratives is like taking a crash course in ""Indianism""--and that is spoken like a honest-to-God Indian Wannabe, I remind myself painfully.Evan Adams is extremely effective as Polatkin the conflicted gay poet, the butt warrior estranged from the Spokane Rez, who is pulled back for his cousin's funeral. Alexie enjoyed himself with the casting, spraying the mix with diverse ethnicity. Adams, who is a full-blooded Indian, looks very Asian in the role. Michelle St. John, wonderful as Agnes, the school teacher who returned to the reservation is half Jewish. Gene Tagaban, playing the volatile Aristotle Joseph, looked every inch the stoic archetypical Indian, great sweeping long black locks, fairly tall, muscular, looked great in buckskin, with that great Injun ""profile"", actually is half Pilipino. Swil Kanim, who played the fiddler Mouse, looked more Cajun than Spokane, and grew facial hair like an Arab. .For some odd reason this interesting Independent film after it worked the Festival Circuit, winning a few awards, just dropped out of sight and was never widely distributed. I have a friend who was in it, and he brought it to my attention. Thank God there is a DVD of it. For Sherman Alexie fans, it is a must see, and for the rest of folks -give yourselves a tasty treat and sit down for this 103 minutes of film, and it will ""move"" you.",4,Aboriginal Sanctuary,1195516800,"11 20, 2007",2007,3544,"['Northwest', 'author', 'director', 'poet', 'producer', 'activist', 'humorist', 'Sherman', 'Alexie', 'gathered', 'group', 'friends', 'together', 'made', 'movie', 'almost', 'did', 'Falling', 'little', 'short', 'mark', 'polished', 'finished', 'film', 'nevertheless', 'movie', 'series', 'tableaus', 'are', 'striking', 'emotionally', 'charged', 'challenging', 'understand', 'Indian', 'brothers', 'lovely', 'sad', 'picture', 'many', 'Alexie', 'favorite', 'themes', 'life', 'Rez', 'substance', 'abuse', 'racism', 'native', 'heritage', 'coveting', 'old', 'ways', 'child', 'eye', 'view', 'parental', 'alcoholism', 'struggle', 'meaning', 'ignorant', 'non-caring', 'world', 'driving', 'need', 'Indians', 'have', 'return', 'Rez', 'make', 'difference', 'juxtaposed', 'pulsating', 'need', 'others', 'have', 'stay', 'away', 'build', 'new', 'lives', 'amongst', 'white', 'eyes', 'something', 'new', '-sexuality.Evan', 'Adams', 'long', 'identified', 'Thomas', 'Builds-the-Fire', 'excellent', 'Alexie', 'adaptation', 'SMOKE', 'SIGNALS', '1998', 'stretched', 'creative', 'impulses', 'portray', 'Seymour', 'Polatkin', '-who', 'was', 'very', 'successful', 'gay', 'poet', 'who', 'happened', 'live', 'paleface', 'life', 'partner', 'before', 'time', 'Seymour', 'book', 'store', 'audience', 'Homosexuals', 'were', 'completely', 'accepted', 'other', 'Indians', 'treated', 'special', 'crazy', 'ones', 'disabled', 'cherished', 'protected', 'Homophobia', 'was', 'something', 'Indians', 'had', 'learn', 'white', 'men', 'suppose', 'firewater', 'Evans', 'actor', 'right', 'up', 'front', 'own', 'homosexuality', 'character', 'Seymour', 'interesting', 'mix', 'Alexie', 'heartfelt', 'accurate', 'sound', 'thump', 'eyes.Alexie', 'been', 'criticized', 'revealing', 'too', 'much', 'angst', 'pain', 'sorrow', 'relative', 'kin', 'alcoholism', 'own', '-illuminating', 'substance', 'abuse', 'rabid', 'rampant', 'Indian', 'nations', 'character', 'FANCYDANCING', 'Mouse', 'overdose', 'simply', 'writing', 'actual', 'experience', 'life', 'whole', 'truth', 'regardless', 'literary', 'symbolic', 'consequences', 'support', 'would', 'defend', 'artistic', 'license', 'introspection', 'Reading', 'poetry', 'novels', 'essays', 'narratives', 'taking', 'crash', 'course', 'Indianism', 'spoken', 'honest-to-God', 'Indian', 'Wannabe', 'remind', 'painfully.Evan', 'Adams', 'extremely', 'effective', 'Polatkin', 'conflicted', 'gay', 'poet', 'butt', 'warrior', 'estranged', 'Spokane', 'Rez', 'who', 'pulled', 'back', 'cousin', 'funeral', 'Alexie', 'enjoyed', 'casting', 'spraying', 'mix', 'diverse', 'ethnicity', 'Adams', 'who', 'full-blooded', 'Indian', 'very', 'Asian', 'role', 'Michelle', 'St.', 'John', 'wonderful', 'Agnes', 'school', 'teacher', 'who', 'returned', 'reservation', 'Jewish', 'Gene', 'Tagaban', 'playing', 'volatile', 'Aristotle', 'Joseph', 'looked', 'inch', 'stoic', 'archetypical', 'Indian', 'great', 'sweeping', 'long', 'black', 'locks', 'fairly', 'tall', 'muscular', 'looked', 'great', 'buckskin', 'great', 'Injun', 'profile', 'actually', 'half', 'Pilipino', 'Swil', 'Kanim', 'who', 'played', 'fiddler', 'Mouse', 'looked', 'more', 'Cajun', 'Spokane', 'grew', 'facial', 'hair', 'Arab', '.For', 'odd', 'reason', 'interesting', 'Independent', 'film', 'worked', 'Festival', 'Circuit', 'winning', 'few', 'awards', 'just', 'dropped', 'sight', 'was', 'never', 'widely', 'distributed', 'have', 'friend', 'who', 'was', 'brought', 'attention', 'Thank', 'God', 'DVD', 'Sherman', 'Alexie', 'fans', 'must', 'see', 'rest', 'folks', '-give', 'yourselves', 'tasty', 'treat', 'sit', 'down', '103', 'minutes', 'film', 'will', 'move']",N/A
752024,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0000950WI,Grady Harp,"[5, 6]","While we as a country are discovering/acknowledging the struggles of the different sects within the Middle East, tribal differences that are longstanding and divisive and painful, along comes another sensitive story about Native Americans in this country and how the scars of past and ongoing abuses of our 'reservation resolution' have affected the original peoples of this land.  Sherman Alexie, a fine poet and novelist, has transformed his written works into a film that showers the viewer with insights into a problem about which few are cognizant - intratribal differences that provide schisms within the only  root that binds.Seymour Poltakin (the very talented Evan Adams) is a famous poet who happens to be both Native American and gay.  He is called back to his Reservation in Spokane, Washington for the funeral of his childhood friend Mouse (Swil Kanim) only to confront all of the reasons he has left the Reservation for the 'white man's world' where he has found both financial and emotional success.  Seymour's best friend Aristotle (Gene Tagaban) had originally left the Reservation to go to college with Seymour, but quickly soured to the prejudiced outside world and returned to his Reservation and to an unfortunate life of alcoholism and drug abuse.  The bulk of the storyline revolves around how these two once devoted friends parted ways, the philosophies of each are explored, and though Seymour finds moments of love in his home space, he is still content to return to his white man lover and his life he has chosen.There are many very tender and moving moments in this film: when Seymour is in conversation with Agnes (Michelle St. John) and when Agnes intones the Indian chants and songs at the funeral; Seymour's dialogues with his lover; scenes of quiet while Aristotle abuses himself with drugs; the weaving in and out of the beautiful dancing that flows through the film.  The problem with the movie is the disparity of approaches in telling the story: an interview situation between Rebecca Carroll and Evan Adams is well written but breaks the mood of the poetic form of the story.  The film is obviously low budget and in this case, for this viewer, the rough hand-held camera technique adds a quality of reality to what we are watching.The overall effect at the end of the film is a pang of pain in the heart having witnessed the generations of 'isolation' and the segregation of the Native Americans into spaces both geographical and sociological that have undermined a tremendously valuable asset to our history.  That role of shame is one that will never leave us, and it is a gift that artists like Sherman Alexie can bring this to the public's attention.  Recommended.

Although I am gay, I am not an American Indian, and this movie depends heavily on an appreciation of their culture, their history and (if this movie is at all authentic) their overwhelming love of melodrama.Not a single word in the very stilted and contrived screenplay sounded to me like an actual human being talking, but like a person reading a proclamation about something very profound. The many poetry readings, funeral speeches, etc&mdash;even ordinary conversations between lovers and friends&mdash;sound so forced and pretentious that they're nearly unbearable. That's probably because the movie was written by a poet about himself. When the same poet also directs the movie, the combination practically guarantees a mediocre result.Very, very few successful movies are written and directed by people whose subject is their own lives and whose primary interest is in poetry rather than in movie-making. In fact, I can't think of a single one.If Sherman Alexie had allowed someone else to write and direct his story, it might have worked very well, because it's not an uninteresting story&mdash;but this movie doesn't work at all, not for me. It's too unnatural, and Native Americans ought to be MORE natural than the rest of us, not less.If you have a soft spot for overblown melodrama, stilted dialog, declamatory acting and/or Native Americans, then The Business of Fancydancing may be just right for you.

This is the kind of movie that has to be watched from start to finish.  There are so many messages in this movie and the Native American messenger carries messages for almost everyone who lives, breathes, and is human.  Life on today's reservations, be it the Spokane  or Pine Ridge in South Dakota is one of the America's dirty little secrets.  Reservation residents don't live very long, do battle with alcoholism and die from depression, hopelessness and sorrow every day. Harsh truths that few people know about.  In this movie we see the struggles of those who manage to leave the reservations, those that stay and those that try to return.  Leaving the reservation is only part of the battle, living in the outside world is still tough and Seymour, the lead in this movie, is gay on top of all else.  This is a powerful, powerful movie and some people won't want to hear what it has to say.Michelle St. John gives a wonderful performance as a young woman of both white and native heritage.

How do I know how true they are to The Rez?  Besides, how do Native Americans feel about his portrayal of them?After all, that's a very difficult matter to contend with.  Some of the few Native Americans filmmakers that deal with this issue are often forced to purposefully make their movies self-conscious (including cameras in them, etc.) just to show that they recognize that their portrayal is still through a popular, Anglo ethnocentric medium.  Besides that, Native Americans aren't just one group, one ethnicity... each tribe is a nation, and they all have separate constructions of their identity.  One Indian nation may be represented well in a film, and it confuses the white viewer as to how Indians ""really are"" because other nations ""aren't like that.""Thus, this film.  Sherman Alexie has bound to have suffered criticism for making Indians portrayable to white folk, and this movie shows a Native American writer who has forsaken his tribe in order to write all about it, keeping in mind that the pop culture needs a tragic Indian, one that's half-white in order to relate to the white community, one that's attracted to white people as well.  The entire film is a series of mirrors reflecting it's own problem of identity, which most of the time becomes really tedious but this time is actually really well done.One of the ways he succeeds is in admitting the simple truth: writers are frauds.  Their writing stems from real pain, but in the end they are all just pathological liars.  They make up stories either to make themselves seem more interesting, or to pretend their pain is okay.And the pop culture eats it up while the ones that feel that pain are ignored.--PolarisDiB",5,The Business of Writing,1128297600,"10 3, 2005",2005,1814,"['Sherman', 'Alexie', 'simply', 'amazing', 'writer', 'poems', 'are', 'amazing', 'movies', 'are', 'amazing', 'yet', ""'m"", 'white', 'guy', 'How', 'do', 'know', 'how', 'true', 'are', 'Rez', 'Besides', 'how', 'do', 'Native', 'Americans', 'feel', 'portrayal', 'very', 'difficult', 'matter', 'contend', 'few', 'Native', 'Americans', 'filmmakers', 'deal', 'issue', 'are', 'often', 'forced', 'purposefully', 'make', 'movies', 'self-conscious', 'including', 'cameras', 'etc', 'just', 'show', 'recognize', 'portrayal', 'still', 'popular', 'Anglo', 'ethnocentric', 'medium', 'Native', 'Americans', 'are', ""n't"", 'just', 'one', 'group', 'one', 'ethnicity', 'tribe', 'nation', 'have', 'separate', 'constructions', 'identity', 'One', 'Indian', 'nation', 'may', 'be', 'represented', 'well', 'film', 'white', 'viewer', 'how', 'Indians', 'really', 'are', 'other', 'nations', 'are', ""n't"", 'Thus', 'film', 'Sherman', 'Alexie', 'bound', 'have', 'suffered', 'criticism', 'making', 'Indians', 'portrayable', 'white', 'folk', 'movie', 'Native', 'American', 'writer', 'who', 'forsaken', 'tribe', 'order', 'write', 'keeping', 'mind', 'pop', 'culture', 'tragic', 'Indian', 'one', 'half-white', 'order', 'relate', 'white', 'community', 'one', 'attracted', 'white', 'people', 'as', 'well', 'entire', 'film', 'series', 'mirrors', 'reflecting', 'own', 'problem', 'identity', 'most', 'time', 'really', 'tedious', 'time', 'actually', 'really', 'well', 'done.One', 'ways', 'admitting', 'simple', 'truth', 'writers', 'are', 'frauds', 'writing', 'stems', 'real', 'pain', 'end', 'are', 'just', 'pathological', 'liars', 'make', 'up', 'stories', 'make', 'seem', 'more', 'interesting', 'pretend', 'pain', 'pop', 'culture', 'up', 'ones', 'feel', 'pain', 'are', 'ignored.', 'PolarisDiB']",N/A
752029,ANYWPIGSTKRO1,B0000950WI,swimming rabbit,"[2, 4]","So very Sherman Alexie. So brilliantly creative. So indie filmmaking at its best. I'll warn you that this will not everyone's cuppa bitter root tea--about as far from Hollyweird as you can get...so if you don't like non-Hollyweird films, don't expect the usual and you may still enjoy this. (Caveat: I rather like Hollyweird...just not all the time.) I would call it the best film about poetry and living in two worlds I've ever seen, but I like poetry and live in two worlds. Still, you might like it even if you don't like poetry or live in two worlds. (Although you have to have gone to a poetry reading or author lecture in a white university or artsy fartsy literary venue to fully appreciate the hilarious intercut scenes of Seymour doing his schtick.) I don't quite know how to say it, but this film totally captured (at least for me) the fear of any artist/writer/etc who leaves where they came from and writes/makes art about their people and is celebrated as an outsider but is never accepted for what they want to be accepted for at home... of being found out as an impostor or being not-accepted by their people in that role. I used to call this my My Name is Asher Lev fear (although I admit never finishing that book), and now I think I have to call it my Seymour Polatkin Fear. (Maybe that makes no sense. eh.)Anyway. If you dig Evan Adams, he's prit-ty awesome as a Gay Urban Indian Poet...yep. One thing I would want to point out, though, is that even though this film is often categorized as a Gay/Lesbian film and even won some related award, I would not label it like that at all. Yes, the main character is gay, and even as inherently navel-gazing as poetry is (and Evan's Seymour character is), this isn't about gay identity angst (in my opinion). And I don't know who put the tag in here, but I'm sorry, this isn't about 'interracial homoerotica.' I wouldn't want to label it with any other Blockbuster label, but if I had to, I'd say it's a really, really Good Indian Movie about people.I don't know what took me so long to see this...when it came out and run through the festival circuit I remember trying to get the university theater to run it, and it never worked out. But I bought the soundtrack then, worth it if only for Michelle St. John and Jennifer Kriesberg (the high-voiced chica from Ulali) singing one of the most beautiful songs ever to end a movie with)...but the 49's and Swil Kanam's stuff with Gene Tabagan is awesome, too. It was great to finally see the context of the songs.",5,"2 worlds (or maybe 3, or 4 or...)",1224633600,"10 22, 2008",2008,2520,"['So', 'very', 'Sherman', 'Alexie', 'So', 'brilliantly', 'creative', 'So', 'indie', 'filmmaking', 'best', ""'ll"", 'warn', 'will', 'not', 'everyone', 'cuppa', 'bitter', 'root', 'tea', 'far', 'Hollyweird', 'can', 'get', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'non-Hollyweird', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'usual', 'may', 'still', 'enjoy', 'Caveat', 'rather', 'Hollyweird', 'just', 'not', 'time', 'would', 'call', 'best', 'film', 'poetry', 'living', 'two', 'worlds', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'like', 'poetry', 'live', 'two', 'worlds', 'Still', 'might', 'like', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'poetry', 'live', 'two', 'worlds', 'have', 'have', 'gone', 'poetry', 'reading', 'author', 'lecture', 'white', 'university', 'artsy', 'fartsy', 'literary', 'venue', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'hilarious', 'intercut', 'scenes', 'Seymour', 'doing', 'schtick', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'know', 'how', 'say', 'film', 'totally', 'captured', 'least', 'fear', 'artist/writer/etc', 'who', 'where', 'came', 'writes/makes', 'art', 'people', 'celebrated', 'outsider', 'never', 'accepted', 'what', 'want', 'be', 'accepted', 'home', 'being', 'found', 'out', 'impostor', 'being', 'not-accepted', 'people', 'role', 'used', 'call', 'Name', 'Asher', 'Lev', 'fear', 'admit', 'never', 'finishing', 'book', 'now', 'think', 'have', 'call', 'Seymour', 'Polatkin', 'Fear', 'Maybe', 'sense', 'eh.', 'Anyway', 'dig', 'Evan', 'Adams', 'prit-ty', 'awesome', 'Gay', 'Urban', 'Indian', 'Poet', 'yep', 'One', 'thing', 'would', 'want', 'point', 'out', 'though', 'even', 'film', 'often', 'categorized', 'Gay/Lesbian', 'film', 'even', 'won', 'related', 'award', 'would', 'not', 'label', 'Yes', 'main', 'character', 'gay', 'even', 'inherently', 'navel-gazing', 'poetry', 'Evan', 'Seymour', 'character', ""n't"", 'about', 'gay', 'identity', 'angst', 'opinion', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'put', 'tag', 'here', ""'m"", 'sorry', ""n't"", 'about', ""'interracial"", 'homoerotica', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'label', 'other', 'Blockbuster', 'label', 'had', ""'d"", 'say', 'really', 'really', 'Good', 'Indian', 'Movie', 'people.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'took', 'so', 'long', 'see', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'run', 'festival', 'circuit', 'remember', 'trying', 'get', 'university', 'theater', 'run', 'never', 'worked', 'out', 'bought', 'soundtrack', 'then', 'only', 'Michelle', 'St.', 'John', 'Jennifer', 'Kriesberg', 'high-voiced', 'chica', 'Ulali', 'singing', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'songs', 'ever', 'end', 'movie', '49', 'Swil', 'Kanam', 'stuff', 'Gene', 'Tabagan', 'awesome', 'too', 'was', 'great', 'finally', 'see', 'context', 'songs']",N/A
