809151,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B0001KNDTE,Kevin Killian,"[11, 14]","A friend of mine bought this DVD thinking it was finally the famous George Cukor version of DAVID COPPERFIELD, and when he found out it was not (it's not even on DVD yet) he was, well, disappointed is a good word for it.  But when I heard of his mistake, the only thing I could think of was, don't sent it back to Amazon, let me have it!  For David Copperfield fans, we have long ago forgiven him for using such a stupid pseudonym, we don't even think any more about how he got his name.  No one asks Siegfried and Roy if their real names are Siegfried and Roy, and yet David Copperfield gets flack about this constantly, not to mention dissed in the press for his relationship with Claudia Schiffer.Some say that their engagement was just for show, and when Tom Cruise proposed to Katie Holmes recently, some commentators cast back to the famous Schiffer-Copperfield liaison which was widely thought of to be a contract.  On this DVD you can see that the love that they shared was no ""ILLUSION.""  There's a lot of Claudia here and I hope that her fans all have a copy of this magic disk, which truly has the best of both worlds, eye-popping stunts, and eye-popping high fashion beauty.  They both dress in stylish outfits that the late Gianni Versace made especially for them!  Copperfield has special cutaway clothes that allow him to make the dangerous escapes a la Houdini.  DC fans know that if anyone in the world had access to any of the magician's secrets, it was Versace, but he was often called in for the planning and the surprises.  Since his tragic death, Donatella has sometimes worked with DC, but not often, the two just don't care for each other.You will find so much commentary on this disk you wonder how he can keep his secrets to himself.  But he does!  Watch him walk right through the ""forbidden passage"" of the Great Wall.  Watch him make the Statue of Liberty disappear from its perch in New York harbor.  You'll be rubbing your eyes wondering how in the world he did it.  Magic at its best, or my name ain't Houdini.",5,Only The Best From Our Boy,1121299200,"07 14, 2005",2005,2042,"['friend', 'mine', 'bought', 'DVD', 'thinking', 'was', 'finally', 'famous', 'George', 'Cukor', 'version', 'DAVID', 'COPPERFIELD', 'when', 'found', 'was', 'not', 'not', 'even', 'DVD', 'yet', 'was', 'well', 'disappointed', 'good', 'word', 'when', 'heard', 'mistake', 'only', 'thing', 'could', 'think', 'was', 'do', ""n't"", 'sent', 'back', 'Amazon', 'let', 'have', 'David', 'Copperfield', 'fans', 'have', 'long', 'ago', 'forgiven', 'using', 'stupid', 'pseudonym', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'think', 'more', 'how', 'got', 'name', 'one', 'Siegfried', 'Roy', 'real', 'names', 'are', 'Siegfried', 'Roy', 'yet', 'David', 'Copperfield', 'flack', 'constantly', 'not', 'mention', 'dissed', 'press', 'relationship', 'Claudia', 'Schiffer.Some', 'say', 'engagement', 'was', 'just', 'show', 'when', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'proposed', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'recently', 'commentators', 'cast', 'back', 'famous', 'Schiffer-Copperfield', 'liaison', 'was', 'widely', 'thought', 'be', 'contract', 'DVD', 'can', 'see', 'love', 'shared', 'was', 'ILLUSION', 'lot', 'Claudia', 'here', 'hope', 'fans', 'have', 'copy', 'magic', 'disk', 'truly', 'best', 'worlds', 'eye-popping', 'stunts', 'eye-popping', 'high', 'fashion', 'beauty', 'dress', 'stylish', 'outfits', 'late', 'Gianni', 'Versace', 'made', 'especially', 'Copperfield', 'special', 'cutaway', 'clothes', 'allow', 'make', 'dangerous', 'la', 'Houdini', 'DC', 'fans', 'know', 'anyone', 'world', 'had', 'access', 'magician', 'secrets', 'was', 'Versace', 'was', 'often', 'called', 'planning', 'surprises', 'tragic', 'death', 'Donatella', 'sometimes', 'worked', 'DC', 'not', 'often', 'two', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'other.You', 'will', 'find', 'so', 'much', 'commentary', 'disk', 'wonder', 'how', 'can', 'keep', 'secrets', 'Watch', 'walk', 'right', 'forbidden', 'passage', 'Great', 'Wall', 'Watch', 'make', 'Statue', 'Liberty', 'disappear', 'perch', 'New', 'York', 'harbor', ""'ll"", 'be', 'rubbing', 'eyes', 'wondering', 'how', 'world', 'did', 'Magic', 'best', 'name', 'ai', ""n't"", 'Houdini']",David Copperfield - Illusion

The majority of this DVD presents 15 years of David's stunning grand illusion - disappearing Statue of Libery, vanishing a train, vanishing an airplane, walking through a Great Wall in China, levitating, flying, and much more ... even the viewers disappear and reappear.  There is also some sleight-of-hand magic and a lot of extras - including a brief visit to David's Museum of Magic.Among his many brilliant ideas and hard work, I was delighted that he has also initiated a ""Project Magic"" - intended to teach simple magic tricks and help develop dexterity in people who are disabled as adjunct to their treatments not only to help with their therapy, but also to help enhance their self-esteem.",5,Totally Awesome,1102118400,"12 4, 2004",2004,799,"['art', 'magic', 'illusion', 'very', 'best', 'unparalleled', 'creative', 'daring', 'heartwarming', 'majority', 'DVD', '15', 'years', 'David', 'stunning', 'grand', 'illusion', 'disappearing', 'Statue', 'Libery', 'vanishing', 'train', 'vanishing', 'airplane', 'walking', 'Great', 'Wall', 'China', 'levitating', 'flying', 'much', 'more', 'even', 'viewers', 'disappear', 'reappear', 'also', 'sleight-of-hand', 'magic', 'lot', 'extras', 'including', 'brief', 'visit', 'David', 'Museum', 'Magic.Among', 'many', 'brilliant', 'ideas', 'hard', 'work', 'was', 'delighted', 'also', 'initiated', 'Project', 'Magic', 'intended', 'teach', 'simple', 'magic', 'tricks', 'help', 'develop', 'dexterity', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'disabled', 'adjunct', 'treatments', 'not', 'only', 'help', 'therapy', 'also', 'help', 'enhance', 'self-esteem']",David Copperfield - Illusion
809153,ACVFTS9X2MKJ8,B0001KNDTE,"Rykre ""The Rogue Scholar""","[3, 3]","This DVD is always entertaining to watch.  David Copperfield is more than just a good looking magician.  He knows how to tease and entice his audience.  He picks the right music for stimulation, the right costumes for dramatic flare, and of course, very good looking girls to work with while he performs his tricks on stage.His stage shows are very colorful and artistic.  Mystifying as well as dark and sensual. And is always entertaining to watch even through we know what's going to happen because we've already watched these performances several times by now.  But, even though, this was just a collection of his past performances put together for a ""made for TV"" special, I really do believe that it is worthy of a high Definition re-mastering and made available as a Blu-Ray release.  Who knows when we'll ever see a more entertaining magician in our lifetime.  These episodes of dramatic, as well as sensual performances of magic should go down as a documented means of history as David Copperfield is probably the most celebrated magician since Houdini.If you agree, let's hear your two cents worth.",4,I wish this could be re-released in High Definition Blu-Ray,1280620800,"08 1, 2010",2010,1107,"['DVD', 'always', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'David', 'Copperfield', 'more', 'just', 'good', 'looking', 'magician', 'how', 'tease', 'entice', 'audience', 'right', 'music', 'stimulation', 'right', 'costumes', 'dramatic', 'flare', 'course', 'very', 'good', 'looking', 'girls', 'work', 'tricks', 'stage.His', 'stage', 'shows', 'are', 'very', 'colorful', 'artistic', 'Mystifying', 'as', 'well', 'dark', 'sensual', 'always', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'even', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'happen', ""'ve"", 'already', 'watched', 'performances', 'several', 'times', 'now', 'even', 'was', 'just', 'collection', 'past', 'performances', 'put', 'together', 'made', 'TV', 'special', 'really', 'do', 'believe', 'worthy', 'high', 'Definition', 're-mastering', 'made', 'available', 'Blu-Ray', 'release', 'Who', 'when', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', 'more', 'entertaining', 'magician', 'lifetime', 'episodes', 'dramatic', 'as', 'well', 'sensual', 'performances', 'magic', 'should', 'go', 'down', 'as', 'documented', 'means', 'history', 'David', 'Copperfield', 'probably', 'most', 'celebrated', 'magician', 'Houdini.If', 'agree', 'let', 'hear', 'two', 'cents', 'worth']",David Copperfield - Illusion
