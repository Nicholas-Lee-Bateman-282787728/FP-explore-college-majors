565544,AGA6B9FHJ6HY0,B000053VAC,D. McNevin,"[2, 2]","What an excellent DVD. Not a concert..... a live session with an audience. These are the best shows to have on DVD in my opinion. Small venues lend to a more controlled atmosphere for the performer. The result is better sound quality, video quality and a more personable performance. Keb Mo is a very good musician and entertainer and he is ably if not excellently backed by his band. Highlights are ""Every Morning"" and ""Love Yourself"". Nice addition to the DVD collection.",5,Intimate,1174694400,"03 24, 2007",2007,473,"['What', 'excellent', 'DVD', 'Not', 'concert', 'live', 'session', 'audience', 'are', 'best', 'shows', 'have', 'DVD', 'opinion', 'Small', 'venues', 'lend', 'more', 'controlled', 'atmosphere', 'performer', 'result', 'better', 'sound', 'quality', 'video', 'quality', 'more', 'personable', 'performance', 'Keb', 'Mo', 'very', 'good', 'musician', 'entertainer', 'ably', 'not', 'excellently', 'backed', 'band', 'Highlights', 'are', 'Morning', 'Love', 'Nice', 'addition', 'DVD', 'collection']",N/A

A great selection of tunes from his first couple discs, but defnitely not carbon copies of the originals.  If you get a chance to see him, do it, especially if it's just him and his guitar.  Maybe not for blues purists, or those expecting screaming electric blues guitar, just great music.",5,Great Show!,1086912000,"06 11, 2004",2004,339,"['like', 'Keb', 'Mo', ""'ll"", 'love', 'DVD', 'A', 'great', 'selection', 'tunes', 'first', 'couple', 'discs', 'defnitely', 'not', 'carbon', 'copies', 'originals', 'get', 'chance', 'see', 'do', 'especially', 'just', 'guitar', 'Maybe', 'not', 'blues', 'purists', 'expecting', 'screaming', 'electric', 'blues', 'guitar', 'just', 'great', 'music']",N/A

Seriously - this DVD shows us Keb's doing what he does best, exuding pure blues. He is a wonderful musician and he has a magical presence. This DVD, ( while a little shabby on the production side) is well worth the money Try it!",4,This man is a genuis,998611200,"08 24, 2001",2001,341,"['hear', 'far', 'too', 'little', 'Keb', 'Mo', 'sometimes', 'think', 'conspiracy', 'hide', 'man', 'undeniable', 'talents', 'Seriously', 'DVD', 'Keb', 'doing', 'what', 'best', 'exuding', 'pure', 'blues', 'wonderful', 'musician', 'magical', 'presence', 'DVD', 'little', 'shabby', 'production', 'side', 'well', 'money', 'Try']",N/A

Keb's music reminds me of a time gone by in this country, a good time. His music and his words have meaning and that's important. His songs are like stories, like reading a good book. Keb puts his heart in in them and it shows. Simply and great performance, please buy one, your heart and mind will thank you. Side note: during the concert Keb mentions that he wrote the song ""City Boy"" while living in Los Angeles at Olympic Blvd and La Brea Avenue. It's a small world because I bought my Keb' Mo' DVD one block away from this location.",5,Keb' Mo': Keb' GO,1249171200,"08 2, 2009",2009,591,"['Great', 'performance', 'steller', 'songwriter', 'singer', 'Keb', 'music', 'time', 'gone', 'country', 'good', 'time', 'music', 'words', 'have', 'meaning', 'important', 'songs', 'are', 'stories', 'reading', 'good', 'book', 'Keb', 'heart', 'Simply', 'great', 'performance', 'please', 'buy', 'one', 'heart', 'mind', 'will', 'thank', 'Side', 'note', 'concert', 'Keb', 'mentions', 'wrote', 'song', 'City', 'Boy', 'living', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Olympic', 'Blvd', 'La', 'Brea', 'Avenue', 'small', 'world', 'bought', 'Keb', 'Mo', 'DVD', 'one', 'block', 'away', 'location']",N/A
565549,A38VX5UVD6XIRL,B000053VAC,William Jang,"[0, 0]",Great DVD. No problems with turning lyrics off. Excellent supplementary materials: sample track from each of his 5 CDs; short documentary (10 minutes); and biography (with text that is actually legible on the screen -unlike every other DVD!). I'm sure those interested in this DVD are already fans anyway. In that case there should be no hesitation in buying this DVD. The picture quality is excellent (full-screen) and great sound too.,5,Awesome,986169600,"04 2, 2001",2001,436,"['Great', 'DVD', 'problems', 'turning', 'lyrics', 'Excellent', 'supplementary', 'materials', 'sample', 'track', '5', 'CDs', 'short', 'documentary', '10', 'minutes', 'biography', 'text', 'actually', 'legible', 'screen', '-unlike', 'other', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'sure', 'interested', 'DVD', 'are', 'already', 'fans', 'anyway', 'case', 'should', 'be', 'hesitation', 'buying', 'DVD', 'picture', 'quality', 'excellent', 'full-screen', 'great', 'sound', 'too']",N/A
