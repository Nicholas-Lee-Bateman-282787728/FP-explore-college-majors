I've seen all three seasons now and I think season three is the best. This show was finally kicking into high gear when it was cancelled and it's a shame it couldn't have gone on longer. At least most of the surviving orginal cast were allowed some closure in the last episode. I would have like to seen where they were going with Lee Major's charecter ""Poppy"".

There was lots of complaining from some viewers about introducing the women into the show--I for one liked that aspect.  It made the characters more interesting.  There's only so many t.v. episodes you can do just on soldiers patrolling through the jungle.  I thought Tour of Duty had a nice balance of real-life action and emotional drama (unlike China Beach which was just about nurses crying every five minutes).  Loved every bit of this show--however, I didn't like the ending.  It left everyone hanging.

906053,A3U7SU2YTOGNKF,B0009I8QGS,Dan Mx,"[39, 44]","I'm so glad they are going to release this as my tapes of the third season are mostly worn out. We also get more episodes (20) as compared to just 16 in season 2. The boys in Tour Of Duty also steer away from most of the soap opera style episodes and the focus is now more on combat and the soldiers realizations of the futility of the Vietnam war. Some of my favorite episodes of the series were in this season especially when Carl Weathers-from the Rocky movies joins the cast and as a special forces Col. His character and acting are superb and add so much to the series. Lee Majors also joins for a few episodes as an old soldier in his third war.Whether Tour Of Duty has real music from the 60's or the same old tired tracks we have heard throughout the series is irrelevant.  Sure it WOULD be nice to hear those songs, but it seriously doesn't ruin the whole experience. If I want to hear 60's music I can always pop a cd in my stereo and listen. I bought the other two DVD sets to experience the best war series ever, not music.To me the content of these episodes makes this the second best season. Each soldier's tour comes full circle and for better or worse they all have to deal with the problems of overstress from war, recovery the horrors they have seen, and come to grips with their part in it all whether good or bad. The series could not be complete without the closure that is given to topics that have been nagging the soldiers throughout their tours.I doubt after watching all 20 of these episodes anyone who has complained about the music will still be complaining because of the gripping content of each episode.",5,Forget the sound..
