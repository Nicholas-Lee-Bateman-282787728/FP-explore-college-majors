970176,A1273ZFVS59B8I,B000E8DONS,J. A. Engh,"[0, 0]",This video teaches signs for outdoor animals and things seen in nature. My 5 year daughter loves this volume and volume 9 since they have lots and lots of animal signs. The video has Rachel (host) say and sign the word and then the children will demonstrate the sign. To help practice the signs there are more great songs to sign and sing to. Definietly worth the money to own all the videos.,5,"So many animals, so many signs, more great fun.",1183420800,"07 3, 2007",2007,392,"['video', 'signs', 'outdoor', 'animals', 'things', 'seen', 'nature', '5', 'year', 'daughter', 'volume', 'volume', '9', 'have', 'lots', 'lots', 'animal', 'signs', 'video', 'Rachel', 'host', 'say', 'sign', 'word', 'then', 'children', 'will', 'demonstrate', 'sign', 'help', 'practice', 'signs', 'are', 'more', 'great', 'songs', 'sign', 'sing', 'Definietly', 'money', 'own', 'videos']",N/A

Our family loves it as well as the rest of the dvds in the Signing Time! series. My youngest child knows all the signs in this, and an added bonus is that he has learned to read the words associated with the signs.

Taylor ""animal lover""","[0, 0]","We got this for our grandson for his first birthday because his mom (who signs ASL fluently) had checked out others from the series from our local library. She put them on while she showered and dressed (that precious alone time!)  and he loves them.  They move quickly, they're colorful, they repeat the signs enough to learn them, the music is catchy, and the signs are accurate.The proof is in the pudding. He's now 18 months and signs lots of stuff. He is hearing, but he communicated first using sign and, really, I think it's true that kids are less frustrated when they can communicate what they want or need - and speech seems to come later than the ability to sign.  So, for whatever reason, if you want your kids to learn ASL (and even you - I love it too), these DVDs are really good.",5,It works!,1272844800,"05 3, 2010",2010,795,"['got', 'grandson', 'first', 'birthday', 'mom', 'who', 'signs', 'ASL', 'fluently', 'had', 'checked', 'out', 'others', 'series', 'local', 'library', 'put', 'showered', 'dressed', 'precious', 'alone', 'time', 'move', 'quickly', ""'re"", 'colorful', 'repeat', 'signs', 'enough', 'learn', 'music', 'catchy', 'signs', 'are', 'accurate.The', 'proof', 'pudding', 'now', '18', 'months', 'signs', 'lots', 'stuff', 'hearing', 'communicated', 'first', 'using', 'sign', 'really', 'think', 'true', 'kids', 'are', 'less', 'frustrated', 'when', 'can', 'communicate', 'what', 'want', 'need', 'speech', 'come', 'later', 'ability', 'sign', 'So', 'reason', 'want', 'kids', 'learn', 'ASL', 'even', 'love', 'too', 'DVDs', 'are', 'really', 'good']",N/A

970180,ANH9IATJDAFGE,B000E8DONS,"Paul Jones Johnson ""archaeoj""","[0, 0]","This is one of a series of ""Signing Times"" DVDs that teach sign language to kids in an uncomplicated, playful manner that is as much entertainment as educative.  Our daughter is 3 years old and will often choose a Signing Time DVD to watch simply for the fun of it.  We have five different disks from the series and you can't help but pick up some basic signs.  Our daughter uses many of the signs every day to enhance her communication. She knows more of the signs than I do since she will watch them over and over and over.  We started showing her these at age 2 years but I know of parents who have used them much earlier before their children had well developed verbal skills and found their kids able to make use of the basic signs.  Its a great introduction to American Sign Language. This particular volume concentrates on the ""Outdoors"" and offers signs for animals and activities that kids will find appealing and may well encounter on camping trips.  I recently saw one of these same DVDs broadcast on a public television station in North Carolina so it seems their appeal and quality is being recognized for programming purposes.",5,For kids and parents,1152403200,"07 9, 2006",2006,1140,"['one', 'series', 'Signing', 'Times', 'DVDs', 'teach', 'sign', 'language', 'kids', 'uncomplicated', 'playful', 'manner', 'as', 'much', 'entertainment', 'educative', 'daughter', '3', 'years', 'old', 'will', 'often', 'choose', 'Signing', 'Time', 'DVD', 'watch', 'simply', 'fun', 'have', 'five', 'different', 'disks', 'series', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'pick', 'up', 'basic', 'signs', 'daughter', 'many', 'signs', 'day', 'enhance', 'communication', 'more', 'signs', 'do', 'will', 'watch', 'over', 'over', 'over', 'started', 'showing', 'age', '2', 'years', 'know', 'parents', 'who', 'have', 'used', 'much', 'earlier', 'children', 'had', 'well', 'developed', 'verbal', 'skills', 'found', 'kids', 'able', 'make', 'use', 'basic', 'signs', 'great', 'introduction', 'American', 'Sign', 'Language', 'particular', 'volume', 'concentrates', 'Outdoors', 'signs', 'animals', 'activities', 'kids', 'will', 'find', 'appealing', 'may', 'well', 'encounter', 'camping', 'trips', 'recently', 'saw', 'one', 'same', 'DVDs', 'broadcast', 'public', 'television', 'station', 'North', 'Carolina', 'appeal', 'quality', 'being', 'recognized', 'programming', 'purposes']",N/A
