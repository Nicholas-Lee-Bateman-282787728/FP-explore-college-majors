The costumes, lovely props, and supurb acting (specifically from Mr. Quilp and background characters) adds to it all.Not my favorite Dicken's story...it runs basically like a parable on money.The movie is okay.",3,More Interesting Although Loosely Based in Literature,1349654400,"10 8, 2012",2012,548,"['liked', 'movie.The', 'pacing', 'fast', 'compared', 'book', 'yes', 'parts', 'are', 'left', 'out', ""'m"", 'okay', 'it.You', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'learn', 'much', 'Nell', 'character', 'movie', 'sort', 'shallow', 'character', 'begin', '-description', 'wise', 'hard', 'follow', 'when', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'main', 'idea', 'story', 'clear', 'costumes', 'lovely', 'supurb', 'acting', 'specifically', 'Mr.', 'Quilp', 'characters', 'all.Not', 'favorite', 'Dicken', 'story', 'basically', 'parable', 'money.The', 'movie', 'okay']",The Old Curiosity Shop Voyage of the Unicorn

1125708,A1ZL6O24VXF0I1,B0010OIP4S,Diatonic,"[2, 3]","I have not read the Dickens original but I suspect that this is not a very satisfactory dramatization. Parts seem to go very slowly and other parts seem rushed. The story also is rather humdrum Dickens: incredibly angelic people and utterly despicable ones. The baddies come to a bad end, and usually the sweet and innocent ones find happiness at the end. In this case, Little Nell, who is sweetness itself, dies, so there is an unexpected twist there. The actress who plays her suffers from the ""BBC affliction"": she doesn't speak words much of the time but makes little mousy noises to show how sweet and demure she is. As a result you need to subtitles to know what she is saying. Happily, there are subtitles without which much of the DVD would not be intelligible. I like Dickens, but I got bored watching this one third of the way through and hurried through the subsequent scenes to get to the end. I may go back when I muster the patience to do so and watch it all the way through.",2,not very good,1276214400,"06 11, 2010",2010,989,"['have', 'not', 'read', 'Dickens', 'original', 'suspect', 'not', 'very', 'satisfactory', 'dramatization', 'Parts', 'seem', 'go', 'very', 'slowly', 'other', 'parts', 'seem', 'rushed', 'story', 'also', 'rather', 'humdrum', 'Dickens', 'incredibly', 'angelic', 'people', 'utterly', 'despicable', 'ones', 'baddies', 'come', 'bad', 'end', 'usually', 'sweet', 'innocent', 'ones', 'find', 'happiness', 'end', 'case', 'Little', 'Nell', 'who', 'sweetness', 'unexpected', 'twist', 'there', 'actress', 'who', 'suffers', 'BBC', 'affliction', ""n't"", 'speak', 'words', 'much', 'time', 'little', 'mousy', 'noises', 'show', 'how', 'sweet', 'demure', 'result', 'need', 'subtitles', 'know', 'what', 'saying', 'Happily', 'are', 'subtitles', 'much', 'DVD', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'intelligible', 'Dickens', 'got', 'bored', 'watching', 'one', 'third', 'way', 'hurried', 'subsequent', 'scenes', 'get', 'end', 'may', 'go', 'back', 'when', 'muster', 'patience', 'do', 'so', 'watch', 'way']",The Old Curiosity Shop Voyage of the Unicorn

Although I haven't read The Old Curiosity Shop, this DVD version was enough to convince me to skip the book.  Even compared to other Dickens' works, the story here is overly dark, morbid and depressing.  As for the production, the cinematography was fine as well as the casting.  Unfortunately, there was not enough character development to make me care or sympathize with the main characters as they experienced tragedy after tragedy at the hands of a very creepy villain.  The end came as a relief.

The villain in the 1994-version steals the show. You hate the villain, he annoys you, he reminds you of someone you know, and he is hot on the trail of Nell and her grandfather. You do not like the villain in this version either, but you are not yelling at the TV, and you do not feel his pursuit.Each version has something the other versions are missing. This version does a better job with Mr. Swiveller and the little maid.I am comparing this 2007-version to the 1994-version. Compared to TV today, this version is 3 or 4 stars. If you have not seen the 1994-version; you will probably like this OK.I would take the characters and plot and re-write a moral to the story in any version and the book, re-write Nell and her grandfather just a little for a feel-good story. ""Oliver Twist"", ""David Copperfield"", and ""A Christmas Carol"" are perfect. This story has colorful-characters and promising-plot that needs to be changed just a little. You cannot re-write the Bible, but, as great as Dickens was; you can re-write Dickens. This story needed a little something. I go into more detail in my 4-star review of the other, 1994-version, under the comment-button there.This version is better than the 1979-version.

1125713,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0010OIP4S,Tsuyoshi,"[6, 6]","ITV's new adaptation of ""The Old Curiosity Shop"" centers on the heroine Nell Trent living with her grandfather. They are forced to flee his Old Curiosity Shop, however, when the gambling grandfather (who thinks he is doing that for her loving granddaughter) is heavily in debt to Daniel Quilp, who, it is suggested, wants not just the shop, but something else. While Quilp chases them, a mysterious lodger at the attorney Samson Brass's is also looking for the missing daughter.Considering the meandering nature of the storytelling in Victorian novels, ""The Old Curiosity Shop"" (2007) is surprisingly faithful to the original book of Charles Dickens (published in book form in 1841). That is a good thing, to be sure, but there is something missing in the new adaptation, something like sense of humor.Sophie Vavasseur (""Becoming Jane"") plays the heroine Nell Trent (or ""Little Nell"") though she seems much older than she should be. Almost adult, I would say, which makes her suffering less poignant. Toby Jones (""Infamous"") as Daniel Quilp is not very convincing, either, compared with Tom Courtenay in the 1995 adaptation. He makes the role too serious, and his turn as the ""villain"" lacks the Dickensian humor, which is essential to some of the comic scenes of the novel, including the famous line about his ""Aquiline"" nose.Supporting actors fare much better. Adam Godley as Sampson Brass, Zo Wanamaker as Mrs. Jarley and Charlene McKenna as ""The Marchioness"" are all very good, giving subtle nuances to roles that could easily become caricatures. The production designs and the photography are all respectable.This is not a bad adaptation, but I am not still sure why they had to make another film based on this book.(According to IMDb, the film's running time is 120 minutes, but my DVD copy from BBC America says its feature length is ""approximately 93 minutes."")",3,"Not So Bad, Not So Great Dickens Adaptation",1296086400,"01 27, 2011",2011,1869,"['ITV', 'new', 'adaptation', 'Old', 'Curiosity', 'Shop', 'centers', 'heroine', 'Nell', 'Trent', 'living', 'grandfather', 'are', 'forced', 'flee', 'Old', 'Curiosity', 'Shop', 'however', 'when', 'gambling', 'grandfather', 'who', 'doing', 'loving', 'granddaughter', 'heavily', 'debt', 'Daniel', 'Quilp', 'who', 'suggested', 'not', 'just', 'shop', 'something', 'else', 'Quilp', 'mysterious', 'lodger', 'attorney', 'Samson', 'Brass', 'also', 'looking', 'missing', 'daughter.Considering', 'meandering', 'nature', 'storytelling', 'Victorian', 'novels', 'Old', 'Curiosity', 'Shop', '2007', 'surprisingly', 'faithful', 'original', 'book', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'published', 'book', 'form', '1841', 'good', 'thing', 'be', 'sure', 'something', 'missing', 'new', 'adaptation', 'something', 'sense', 'humor.Sophie', 'Vavasseur', 'Becoming', 'Jane', 'heroine', 'Nell', 'Trent', 'Little', 'Nell', 'much', 'older', 'should', 'be', 'Almost', 'adult', 'would', 'say', 'suffering', 'less', 'poignant', 'Toby', 'Jones', 'Infamous', 'Daniel', 'Quilp', 'not', 'very', 'convincing', 'either', 'compared', 'Tom', 'Courtenay', '1995', 'adaptation', 'role', 'too', 'serious', 'turn', 'villain', 'Dickensian', 'humor', 'essential', 'comic', 'scenes', 'novel', 'including', 'famous', 'line', 'Aquiline', 'nose.Supporting', 'actors', 'fare', 'much', 'better', 'Adam', 'Godley', 'Sampson', 'Brass', 'Zo', 'Wanamaker', 'Mrs.', 'Jarley', 'Charlene', 'McKenna', 'Marchioness', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'giving', 'subtle', 'nuances', 'roles', 'could', 'easily', 'become', 'caricatures', 'production', 'designs', 'photography', 'are', 'respectable.This', 'not', 'bad', 'adaptation', 'am', 'not', 'still', 'sure', 'why', 'had', 'make', 'film', 'based', 'book', 'According', 'IMDb', 'film', 'running', 'time', '120', 'minutes', 'DVD', 'copy', 'BBC', 'America', 'feature', 'length', 'approximately', '93', 'minutes']",The Old Curiosity Shop Voyage of the Unicorn
