I am probably more sceptical of recent Disney releases than most of my cohorts, so this movie had to earn 4 stars from me. It is entertaining, a film parents can trust to allow children of all ages watch, and is  equally entertaining for adults. I would by no means put it on par with some of the Disney classics. However, that being said this is by far one of the best films Disney has done in the past 20 years. This film has the feel of one of the classic Disney films prior to the 1980's. A thoroughly enjoyable movie for all ages (I can't say that for all of Disney's recent releases).My version of this movie comes with two short films.

Straight from Pixar/Disney entertainment, we get a fun, freewheeling adventure that is always witty, fresh, and funny.Our hero is Remy (Patton Oswalt) a rat with a lot on his plate.  Survival is his family's primary purpose in life, but Remy doesn't want just to survive, he wants to live.  Having a particularly astute olfactory sense, he disdains the garbage dump for a tastier venue.  When he and his community are evicted from their peasant woman's place, it's a narrow escape at best. Remy is separated from the rest, so he ventures off to see the sights of Paris.  There he happens upon Gusteau's 5-star restaurant, a place where the owner inspires everyone, ""That anyone can cook"".  Gusteau dies of heartache after his place is demoted to 4-star status by critic nemesis Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole) known as ""The Grim Eater"".  Once inside he keeps a low-profile until he comes upon newly hired hand Linguini (Lou Romano) who hands his letter of recommendation from Gusteau's widow to Skinner, the manager.  Skinner is a low-down greedy type who lends the Gusteau name to less haute frozen food cuisine.  In his repertoire are recipes for sabotage and a detective to find Linguini's true heritage to prevent him becoming the restaurant's heir.  Reme' elevates Linguini's cuisine skills with distinctive communication they keep under his hat.  Besides a hostile critic and manager, Linguini faces Collette, a beautiful fellow cook who must bear all the talent but none of the stature of men.'Ratatouille' is thoroughly delightful.  The plot is seasoned with imaginative ingredients that never falter for entertainment.  The peril is creative, and the story is marinated to perfection.  With such a clever and witty script (written by five writers, no less) the pace and execution is suitable for every palate.  It is hard to imagine a better family entertainment for 2007.

The fast-paced animated story of Remy, a little country rat who yearns for bigger things, then gets slammed by a rainstorm (along with his kin) into the sewers of Paris, is a sure winner IMHO.Not to give too much away, but the plot is the basic fish- (or in this case, rat-) out-of-water who goes to the city to make good but almost gets done in in the process. The characterizations and portraiture are vivid, the accents suitably Gallic (voiced mostly by Americans like Janeann Garofolo who took ""Franch"" accent lessons), the CGI is state-of-the-art and vividly and imaginatively used. Slapstick, witty dialogue and pacing make this nearly two-hour flick a joy all the way; even the littlest kids didn't get whiny during this one.An especial ""encore"" goes to Brad Garrett, whose deep bass tones rang out remarkably well as the spirit of a recently-deceased master chef who inspires our hero, Obi-Wan like. ""Ratatouille"" is a fine film -- at the risk of sounding like a shill, why not grab it at this bargain price [May 6, 2008]?  In fact I put ""Ratatouille"" in the same family-classic category as the (original) ""Toy Story"" and the (again original) ""Shrek."" Is a franchise born? Don't wait to find out.The DVD contains not only the movie-length cartoon but director's comments, the same animated short that began theatrical presentations, and (especially fun) a history of the world from the rats' point of view.

From Disney, the company famous for its mouse,comes a loveable rat Remy who wants to cook up a feast. It's an inspiring fairy tale about family, love, and the power of faith. From Michael Giacchino's bistro-worthy soundtrack to the tasty intrigues of the story, ""Ratatouille"" is a cinematic meal.In ""Ratatouille"",Remy the rat (expertly voiced by comedian Patton Oswalt) befriends the garbage boy Linguini. As in Cyrano de Bergerac, Linguini gets the credit for Remy's amazing meals. Linguini might also be the love child of Gousteau,the chef who inspires Remy in visions. Linguini himself is smitten with the no-nonsense chef Colette (a bittersweet Jeanne Garofalo) The devious Skinner (former Bilbo Ian Holm) plans to turn Gousteau's magical recipes into instant frozen meals (like ""Tooth Pickin' Chicken"" and ""Haggis Wraps"") There's also a health inspector who bears an uncanny resemblance to Walt Disney himself. Finally,the evil cadaverous critic Anton Ego (voiced by the equally cadaverous Peter O'Toole) comes to Gousteau's with a bone to pick.""Ratatouille"" is a delicious mix of comedy,in-jokes,and visual wonders. It's an ode to the joys of cooking and the beauty of Paris,the City of Light. It has a moral without being ponderously moralistic.

1100167,A20VXYT5DL0ZC6,B000VBJEEG,"Amazon Customer ""Creator, Entrepreneur, Free ...","[25, 291]","Ever since the preview came out, I looked forward to seeing ""Ratatouille"" with a glowing and anticipatory glee. I even made a point of reserving a seat at the most luxurious, opulent moviehouse in Manhattan, the Ziegfeld showplace theater on 54th Street. As I walked onto the luxuriant plush red embroidered carpeting of the Ziegfeld, I was sure that I could spend the next two hours of my life in pleasant laughter, relaxation and artistic bliss.No such luck!Ratatouille turned out to be another over-the-top, soulless, conceited Hollywood animation gimmick to lure a big box office with over-the-top high-definition animated graphics, over-the-top, gratuitous action scenes (bordering on violent and scary), and lazy, contrived attempts at humor and storytelling which were nothing more than a rehash of tired old stereotypes, slapstick vaudeville routine, and use of any ethinic, social or psychobabble urban mythology which might possibly provoke an audience to force themselves to laugh.In fact, I can't even write a complete review of ""Ratatouille"" here, because I was so irritated and assaulted by this film that I felt compelled to walk out of the auditorium and leave after only thirty minutes. Not only that, but I actually felt compelled to wait in the lobby for ten minutes while the manager gave me a refund, that's how indignant, offended and violated I felt.Specifically: The movie's first 30 minutes featured the following irritating, offensive aspects: 1. The sound levels of the movie (not the theater, because there were quiet segments which disproved that it was the theater's sound system) were ear-splittingly, dangerously loud during many of its ""action"" sequences, most of which in my view would be scary, upsetting and maybe cause nightmares or upset in children. I would certainly not take my young children to see such a movie. OK, the movie is about a rat, which would be ok since he is drawn adequately cute and cuddly, but the producers felt it was also necessary to show marauding packs of thousands of filthy rats hoarding and swarming the entire screen as if they were trying to parody the rat horror flicks of the 1970's. Was it effective? Yes, it effectively made me nauseous and even disturbed, and I'm not 5, I'm 39 years old. 2., In the first 20 minutes, there are several scenes of extreme violence, all of which I thought were totally unnecessary, excessive and again, disturbing. Animated films are supposed to show *restraint* and *discretion* in the choice of their visuals and dialogue, not to immitate a Rambo action movie. Yet no such restraint and discretion was observed here, instead, the directors seemed to think they were free to shoot this movie as if it was ""Die Hard III"". In addition, 3., the film felt continuously as if the producers had a definite, pre-conceived ""agenda""; that is, not to make a natural, free-flowing story of real characters, compelling storyline and natural comedy, music and jokes, but rather to make a movie where they had to insert an endless amount of P.C. (politically-correct) story elements and opinion-points to get across a pre-conceived ""message"" to the audience, checking off political points from a list as they went along. So, in the first twenty minutes, our senses are bombarded when an otherwise quiet senior citizen-retiree grandma character quietly enjoying TV suddenly gains the strength of a 20-year-old young man and literally goes ""berserk"" when she sees Remy and his brother rat, pulling out a 12-guage shotgun, firing about twenty-five 150-decible rounds into the walls (this is where I think my ears were damaged--in fact, my ears still hurt me now even 4 1/2 hours later), trying to blow Remy and brother to pulp, before the producers have her reach on her shelf for more buckshot to reload.Obviously (unless I'm just imagining things), the producers of this film (isn't Pixar and Dreamworks owned by the anti-Gun Rights zealot Steven Shpielberg?) are against people owning guns, because as they emphasize so aggressively and violently, all granmdas in farm country who own shotguns apparently always keep their guns leaning next to them on their recliners when they are watching TV, and they are all so senile and dementiated that they have pop-open umbrellas shoved into the barrels, which pop open in their face when they try to fire at any assailant; and, these otherwise placid grandmas will grab the shotgun at the drop of a hat, and proceed to shoot up their entire cottage, causing thousands of dollars of damage, on the mere sight of any rodent or any other possible threat, whether it's a stray ant, butterfly, or a scary unknown shadow. It's obvious that Steven Shpielberg and his team at Pixar have never lived with gun owners nor in farm country, otherwise they would know that gun owners in country cottages don't shoot up and destroy their homes when they find rodents, they lay traps and poison or they dispatch their cats. But then, if Pixar left out the crazed shotgun-wielding grandma scene, they wouldn't be addressing their producers' pet-peeve gun-control agenda item. (Of course, maybe Steven Shpielberg HAS lived in the country, but he probably lived on an estate with private armed security guards, which is why he doesn't understand that most of the rest of us can't afford private security and we need to own our own guns if we want self-defense.)Then ten minutes later in Paris, Remy spies on a typically-explosive, zealously jealous French couple, who are arguing so intensely that they point a semi-automatic pistol at each other, before quickly flinging it away and leaping into a passionate embrace. Again, according to the producers, anyone who owns a gun is a crazy, unstable basket case, and no one, especially French lovers, or those inclined to love as passionately as French lovers do, should ever be allowed to own a gun, which apparently is why France is wise and intelligent to have so much stricter gun control than we have here in the U.S., or so we're meant to believe. Thank God gun owners and people in general are almost always more responsible than how they're portrayed in this hairbrained movie and the rest of Hollywood. Now granted, the threat of gun violence has been portrayed even in classic animated movies I've loved greatly, such as ""Pocahontas"", but it was done subtly, and it was done in appropriate moments, and it was not over-the-top or even contrived, it was done because it was right and it made sense--here it was obviously and overtly a political or social message: gun owners are all crazy, guns should be banned for civilians, who are just too incompetent and stupid to have them, and inanimate guns are dangerous in and of themselves, blah, blah, blah. Maybe America's #1 Victim-Disarmer, Michael Bloomberg, was one of ""Ratatouille's"" principal investors, who knows. It certainly does display all of Bloomberg's famous manipulativeness and conniving dishonesty.Even in the fancy kitchen environment of Chef Gusteau's 5-Star restaurant where Remy winds up, we're made to sit through fancy, multi-trillion dollar special effects when our poor dopey rat falls into simmering stews, soapy kitchen sinks and buckets of detergent, and we can see every boring pixel of these various liquids and sauces as Remy tumbles into them and thrashes to the surface, yet nowhere is all of this fancy technical animation wizardry even the least bit pleasing or redeeming. And, the creators bungled Gusteau's character, instead of being humorous they only succeed in giving him the biggest jowls and stomach in all of France, but they forgot to make him look genuinely pleasing and enjoyable. The movie's portrayal of French people in general was merely a cross between the usual cynical, surly, nasty French grease ball-type or the pompous, self-absorbed effeminate fools which Americans are constantly urged to think all French people are by our media pundits, people like Bill O'Reilly, Sean Hannity, and similar low-lifes (all of whom themselves usually enjoy vacationing in France, which they know is one of the most beautiful and sophisticated cultures and nations in the entire world. Maybe they just don't want to let the rest of us in on their little secret, but is there really anyone anywhere, even here in Freedom Fry America, who ISN'T aware that France, with its charming, classy, educated men, knockout-gorgeous style-savvy women, classic architecture, art, exquisite geography and culture, is an utterly beautiful and heavenly place to eat, live, talk, and love??).The dialogue and storyline, for the first 30 minutes I was there, was more irritating, incoherent and scattered than it was illuminating or inspiring. In fact, the story played on all the usual gimmicks and cliches, with a sourpuss cynical rat father, the bright, go-for-anything younger brother character who turns out having the exact opposite of dad's personality, the Chef-deity spirit of Chef Gusteau, who the film prematurely reveals is only ""a figment"" of Remy's over-active culinary imagination; and of course, the hopeless underdog loser Linguini, who doubtless succeeds beyond everyone's wildest expectations at the end, right?How sad it all is. As I truly had been eagerly looking forward to enjoying a fine animated work of art, or at the very least a skillful and tastefully done film production. I had very high expectations for this movie, and I was grossly let down. Alas, when we crash into Reality, we realize again that it is usually not to be, not when rich investors need only pluck down a few hundred million, and their Hollywood animation houses can think up an appealing story idea (a French country rat who becomes a world-class chef--yes, that really is a GREAT idea with true potential, yet miserably wasted in this film), crank out a high-tech, easily-marketable animation extravaganza along with a slick movie trailer to pull in yearning audiences, and count on a horde of reliable industry-insider movie critics who will guarantee them a five-star, glowing review, all turned on a dime. And No, I don't care how happily or rosily this movie turned out in the end; like all Hollywood films, I'm sure everything turned our perfectly for our heroes and they all lived happily ever after, yet all that matters to me was that the first thirty minutes were TERRIBLE, therefore the movie was terrible for me, Period. A really great movie is great from start to finish, not just great for the last half or two-third's.When I go to animated movies, I'm prepared to suspend my disbelief and actually accept that Paris' most celebrated Chef has returned from food heaven to guide our heroes to immortality; but magic just won't be allowed, for this movie is made by the same kind of therapeutic-state businessmen as the ones who invest in a pharmaceutical industry that wants to force-feed our children Ritalin and anti-depressants; and a bad animated film like this is certainly enough to make any young child viewer eventually need to be put on a regime of Ritalin or anti-depressants--it's probably movies like this that are partly one reason so many of our kids ARE on Ritalin and Zyprexa.In summary, this film was so disappointing, assaultative on my senses and sensibilities, and disrespectful of my aesthetic tastes and intelligence that I was forced to quickly leave before enduring any more of it.I'm the kind of kid at heart who yearns for things of beauty that I can believe in and admire with all my soul. I love films like ""Mulan"", ""Pocahontas"", ""Fantasia"", movies of pure beauty, innocence, elegance and simplicity, and of course also Japanese anime and European comic novels where artists and writers at least treat their audiences with intellectual respect and sensitivity, if some young children happen to get a hold of those; but I don't care at all for an aggressive, loud, intellectually-lazy film like ""Ratatouille"" where the producers are calculatingly intent on shoving an aggressive and crude political and social agenda down my throat.I feel very upset having had my evening ruined going to this. How is a young child going to feel seeing Ratatouille? Either they're going to be upset by it, or they're going to be bored (hopefully) and leave, or worse, they're going to be further damaged and desensitized from another of the gratuitous, psychologically-heavy ""entertainment"" offerings we're constantly bombarded with in this country, films like Shrek Parts 1-100 and the rest of them, where every kids' film has to be a mind-blowing electrocution of subtle messages, hyperactive pranks, social commentary, elaborate visuals, clever entendras, nerve-shattering action scenes and cruel inside jokes. I'm sorry, but it all gives me a headache. Can't we make simple, enjoyable, warm movies anymore, movies that don't try to be too much, movies that even might have some quiet, tranquil moments??Yeah, Ratatouille has stunning, near-divine high definition animation. Unfortunately, it's the product of a bunch of shallow, politically-motivated Hollywood business people who don't know the first thing about what is important in High Art--and that's the kind of art I think animated movies should live up to, when they are following in the footsteps of the classic Disney-type films, and animation was first created with that aspiring ideal and commitment to pure beauty. I'll give them a hint: Any great movie starts with the writing and scripting, not with budgeting $100 billion for the f/x department. And animation art is supposed to flow and blossom naturally, not be jerked and prodded along like prisoners on the Bataan Death March.""Ratatouille"" was a complete failure before the film even ended, when I was nowhere to be seen by the other people who had stayed to watch it. Apparently, they have far more endurance and tolerance for mediocrity than I do. Instead, I found a beautiful new art deco bar nearby where they had about a million times the sense of style, taste, beauty and restraint, just in their pinky fingers, as ""Ratatouille's"" producers had displayed in a mere thirty minutes of screen time and $50 million dollars of production costs. There was no loud music, no garrish visuals, no cheap jokes and no earthshaking thrillrides--finally I had regained some quiet and peace in which to attempt to decompress and calm down after this movie's body-slamming, full-frontal assault.",1,"""Ratatouille"": A Pretentious, Unfunny, Ear-Splitting Mishmash of Social Agendas, Bad Ambiance and Visual Excesses",1183161600,"06 30,

1100169,AC7J2CCGFQXY9,B000VBJEEG,"Amazon Customer ""fairytales&dreams""","[3, 3]","This is my favorite Pixar animated movie and I give it 4.5 stars.  I have watched this movie countless times, and I never get tired of it!  Maybe it's because the main attraction is *food* and I love food. =)Remy is a rat, but he's not your ordinary rat.  He has dreams bigger than slumming it in the gutters with his family, making do with scraps from the garbage bin.  His dreams encompass becoming a chef, and creating dishes that tantalize the taste buds.  He occupies his time watching a cooking show by famous Parisian chef Gusteau and learning the trade in the kitchen of an old cottage.  Unfortunately, being a rat, he is run off the property by the owner in a very funny scene (an old lady in hair curlers wielding a shotgun.LOL).  This sets in motion his journey to realize his dream of becoming a chef.Okay, you're probably wondering what is so great about a story in which the main character is a rat?!  I thought the same thing, and never did go see this movie when it was out in theatres.  Finally, on a whim I bought the DVD to watch and was pleasantly surprised by the humor and touching warmth of the story about, yes a rat!There were so many moments of humorous scenes, I think my favorite is Remy getting caught in the act of fixing a soup Linguini messed up, with Linguini standing there in astonishment as he watches a rat cooking.At its heart, it is about reaching for your dreams despite the odds and obstacles set in your path.  Despite the nay-sayers who say, ""You can't do this!"", which Remy encountered a few times from his family especially his father.

1100176,AXOZ5BWOEDL76,B000VBJEEG,Andrew C. Miller,"[0, 0]","Ratatouille [Blu-ray] [Limited Edition SteelBook] [German Import] Animated adventure from the creators of 'Cars' and 'The Incredibles'. Remy (voiced by Patton Oswalt) is a rat who dreams of becoming a great French chef despite the obvious problem of being a rat in a decidedly rodent-phobic profession. When fate places Remy in the sewers of Paris, he finds himself ideally situated beneath a restaurant made famous by his culinary hero, Auguste Gusteau [Brad Garrett]. Despite the apparent dangers of being an unlikely - and certainly unwanted - visitor in the kitchen of a fine French restaurant, Remy's passion for cooking soon sets into motion a hilarious and exciting rat race that turns the culinary world of Paris upside down. Remy finds himself torn between his calling and passion in life or returning forever to his previous existence as a rat. As good a film as Pixar has ever put out, Ratatouille is a frantic, innovative movie, boasting some of the finest quality animation ever put on the screen.Voice Cast: Patton Oswalt, Lou Romano, Janeane Garofalo, Ian Holm, Brian Dennehy, Peter O'Toole, Brad Garrett, Peter Sohn, Will Arnett and Brad BirdDirector: Brad BirdProducer: Brad LewisScreenwriter: Brad BirdComposer: Michael GiacchinoCinematography: Robert Anderson and Sharon CalahanResolution: 1080pAspect Ratio: 2.39:1Audio: English: 5.1 DTS-HD Uncompressed [Movie Only], English: 5.1 Dolby Digital, Italian: 5.1 DTS [Movie Only], Italian: 5.1 Dolby Digital [Movie Only], German: 5.1 DTS [Movie Only] and German: 5.1 Dolby DigitalSubtitles: English, English SDH, Italian and GermanRunning Time: 111 minutesRegion: Region B/2Number of discs: 1Studio: PIXAR Animation Studios/Walt Disney PicturesAndrew&#8217;s Blu-ray Review &#8211; When PIXAR first announced 'Ratatouille' as its next project, I was sceptical, especially an animated movie about rats cooking in a French restaurant? It sounded completely unappetizing and, to be blunt, like commercial suicide. How do you sell such a potentially sophisticated and just plain foreign concept to the American masses? As big a fan as I'd been of the company's stellar past work, I just couldn't see this one as being a hit.But, oh ye of little faith! 'Ratatouille' proved to be the little rodent that could, not only surmounting its marketing challenges with ease (it's grossed nearly $600 million at the worldwide box office, and still counting), but proving to be 2007's most delightful surprise. It's an absolutely enchanting concoction and a movie so imaginative and delightful that yes, I would rank it right up there with the absolute best that PIXAR has yet produced.'Ratatouille' is deceptively sublime, a movie that appears as light as a souffl&eacute; but is really quite the sophisticated dish. Although the concept of a talking critter film is hardly anything new. PIXAR has never been interested in churning out the kind of frantic, cluttered, pop-culture-referencing stew that usually passes for an animated movie these days. Instead, under the mindful direction of Brad Bird ['The Incredibles' and 'The Iron Giant'], we get a story that's downright literary, and a cinematic style that borrows from such a disparate bag of classical traditions that frankly it's unlike anything I've ever seen in a mainstream animated feature. Who else but PIXAR could combine the slapstick farce of Charlie Chaplin, elegant visuals right out of a Seurat painting, and a Cyrano de Bergerac-inspired tale about a bunch of chefs and rats cooking together, and somehow make it universally resonant?In 'Ratatouille,' Brad Bird returns to two key themes he also explored in 'The Incredibles' and the importance of pursuing excellence over mediocrity, and the always-unbreakable bonds of family. 'Ratatouille' frames its story in the most unlikely of places, however, and with the most unlikely of heroes. Remy (voiced astonishingly well by comedian Patton Oswalt) is a blue rat blessed with one very cultured palate. He's smart, fastidious, talented and filled with grand dreams of being the world's greatest chef, much to the consternation of his slacker but still good-natured brother Emile [Peter Sohn] and his grizzled father Django [Brian Dennehy], who both find his determination to create culinary masterpieces a sure sign of madness.Following an unexpected series of events that see Remy and his family evicted from their rural haven, the plot kicks into high gear, with Remy forced to escape through the sewers (in the first of one of many beautifully staged action sequences), and winding up in Paris. Following his nose as much as his ambition, he discovers a small restaurant once owned by the legendary chef Aususte Gusteau, whose famous motto (&#34;Anyone can cook!&#34;) had an immediate influence on Remy. Sneaking in late one night to add a little spice to a soup, the next day the dish is suddenly a sensation.This leads to the film's odd-couple pairing, as the restaurant's completely untalented garbage boy, Linguini [Lou Romano], is pegged as the chef of the soup. Desperate to keep his new star job, Linguini employs Remy's services as a &#34;ghost chef,&#34; which leads to a classic series of complications. Can Remy and Linguini find a way to work together and avoid discovery? Things get even more complicated after Linguini falls for the kitchen's beautiful Colette [Janeane Garofalo], and a particularly nasty restaurant critic [a brilliant and terrific Peter O'Toole] begins asking one too many questions about the nature of the dish.'Ratatouille' works on every level. It's funny and intelligent, wonderfully written and performed, and has an incredible visual zest and buoyancy. An exceptional attention to detail has always been a hallmark of the best Pixar films, and 'Ratatouille' is superlative even by their high standards. Bird, and his team of writers, animators and actors have fully conceived and executed a unique universe that feels alive and real. It's also a structural feat of engineering, with Bird effortlessly alternating between rodent and human perspectives. This is masterful storytelling, not just great animation or cute characters, and by the time 'Ratatouille's 111 minutes have flown by, we feel like we've only scratched the surface of this magical, fantastic new world.Ultimately, what impresses the most about 'Ratatouille' is that it dares to be original. Once again, PIXAR has proven that it is not only by far the best producer of animated movies on the planet, but that it's a company that has no intention of resting on its creative laurels. I can only hope PIXAR continues to nurture these instincts, because for me, they've never stepped wrong. 'Ratatouille' stands tall among ever-growing canon of PIXAR classics, and I can't wait to see what's next on their menu.Blu-ray Video Quality &#8211; PIXAR and Disney present the film in an awesome 1080p video image at its original theatrical aspect ratio of 2.39:1, and every single pixel is, well, perfect. This is simply the best high-definition presentation I've ever seen of an animated feature. A direct digital-to-digital conversion, the transfer is as delicious as the greatest French feast you've ever had. The film's colour palette is just gorgeous, with delicate shades of pinks, blues and greens contrasting wonderfully with deeper crimsons and purples. The finely-tuned shadings and gradients are so smoothly rendered that the image leaps off the screen. This is gloriously three-dimensional animation, and the sense of depth and texture to the image is exactly what high-def is all about. All other elements of the presentation are superb as well -- blacks, contrast and sharpness are spot-on. Simply put the picture quality of this Blu-ray edition of 'Ratatouille' absolutely flawless.Blu-ray Audio Quality &#8211; Like the video, the 5.1 DTS-HD Uncompressed audio tracks on this Blu-ray disc is also terrific. 'Ratatouille' is more warm and subtle, but no less engrossing. This is a perfect example of how fantastic great sound design can be even when it's not ramming you over the head with bombast. This soundtrack is not unlike a great fine wine. From every word of dialogue to the wonderful score by Michael Giacchino, it all just seems to slide out of the speakers. Completely constructed in the studio, it's just so clean and smooth. The use of surrounds is just as elegant. Atmosphere is king here, with transparent pans between channels and excellent spatiality, which delivers a constant sense of envelopment yet is never overpowering. And lest one thinks dynamics might be wimpy, low bass is certainly deep enough when needed (wait for the lightning bolt -- you'll feel it), and the robust highs are equally wonderful. Dialogue is perfectly rendered, and I never even thought of touching the volume button on my remote.Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:Fine Food and Film [Feature Documentary] &#8220;Fine Food and Film&#8221; takes a look inside the kitchen of world-renowned chef Thomas Keller and the studio of Academy Award winning director Brad Bird.

It's adventurous, witty, visually captivating and utterly charming. This Blu-ray release is also fantastic, boasting absolutely perfect video and audio, plus a great package of extras. I've reviewed over 500 next-gen discs over the last year and a half, and not one has received a perfect five star rating overall, but there's a first time for everything and I'm happy to report that 'Ratatouille' is it. This is a must-own disc that no Blu-ray collection should be without. Despite the high praise of this Limited Edition SteelBook, but soon I will be upgrading to the forthcoming release of 'Ratatouille' being released here in the UK in stunning 3D and if it is the same awesome 3D images you get from the PIXAR 3D Animation of UP, then I know the 3D 'Ratatouille' will blow me away and so honoured to have another stunning PIXAR animation added to my ever increasing PIXAR Animation Studios Blu-ray Collection.

1100177,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000VBJEEG,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","I had mixed feelings going into this movie.  On the one hand I had `The Incredibles' in memory, one of the finest cartoons ever made.  On the other I had `Cars' still in recent memory, one of the most overrated, over hyped pieces of cartoon garbage I had the horror of having to sit through.  Thankfully `Ratatouille' leans towards `The Incredibles', delivering one of the most refreshing and entertaining cartoon experiences in recent memory.  Cartoon's as of late have been on the dull side, none really jumping out and saying ""I am the next classic, I am the movie your children and your children's children will love forever"", until now.  Now, this isn't to say that `Ratatouille' is perfect, because in my opinion `The Incredibles' is a better all around film, but `Ratatouille' is the finest film to be released in cartoon form since it's glorious predecessor (I know, I really need to see `Persepolis', and I will eventually).`Ratatouille' revolves around Remy, a young rat who, unlike the rest of his pack, really cherishes food.  Sure, his fellow rats love to eat, but they'll eat anything.  Remy only wants the best food he can attain.  He's picky.  Living in France Remy has become fascinated with the famed chef Auguste Gusteau and is brokenhearted to hear that he has died suddenly upon receiving a scathing review by food critic Anton Ego.  Auguste firmly believed that anyone could cook and even wrote a book to that effect, a book that Remy would sneak out to read.  When an unfortunate event separates Remy from his family he finds himself in Paris with the most desirable of opportunities at his paws.Remy finds the late Gusteau's restaurant, now run by his sous-chef Skinner, a man who is as intolerable as he is feisty.  He is soon propositioned by a young garbage boy, Linguini, who, thanks to Remy, has been mistaken for a chef with talent and been promoted to the important position.  With Remy's talent and Linguini's human looks they pass off as the best chef Paris has ever seen, but a secret that Skinner is privy to leads him to work his hardest to thwart Linguini's progress.`Ratatouille' does a brilliant job of not only delivering state of the art animation (the movie is BEAUTIFUL to look at) but delivering a warm and touching story that gives real heart to these characters.  Remy's love for food, his passion and his determination to be himself despite the disapproval of those closest to him (namely his father) is admirable and teaches us the importance of fighting for what we believe in, for what we know is our destiny.  It also reigns forward with lessons on loyalty and humility, of honesty and compassion.  It teaches children and adults alike that these are admirable and commendable traits we all should strive to achieve.The voice talents enlisted here are superb, Patton Oswald delivering magnificently as Remy and Peter O'Toole truly stealing the show as the feared critic Anton Ego.With it's keen eye to detail, both in imagery and in story, `Ratatouille' proves itself deserving of all the praise that has been heaped upon it's sturdy shoulders and manages to be one of the only cartoons in recent years to be worthy of the Animated Feature Oscar.  Let's just say that if `Ratatouille' loses this year it'll be a crying shame, to know that the mediocre at best `Happy Feet' has an Oscar and this magical adventure does not.  Well, I have a feeling that this little rat will run full force to the podium this year to accept his very well deserved prize.",5,I smell something delectable...,1199750400,"01 8, 2008",2008,3502,"['had', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'going', 'movie', 'one', 'hand', 'had', 'Incredibles', 'memory', 'one', 'finest', 'cartoons', 'ever', 'made', 'other', 'had', 'Cars', 'still', 'recent', 'memory', 'one', 'most', 'overrated', 'hyped', 'pieces', 'cartoon', 'garbage', 'had', 'horror', 'having', 'sit', 'Thankfully', 'Ratatouille', 'towards', 'Incredibles', 'delivering', 'one', 'most', 'refreshing', 'entertaining', 'cartoon', 'experiences', 'recent', 'memory', 'Cartoon', 'late', 'have', 'been', 'dull', 'side', 'none', 'really', 'jumping', 'out', 'saying', 'am', 'next', 'classic', 'am', 'movie', 'children', 'children', 'children', 'will', 'love', 'forever', 'now', 'Now', ""n't"", 'say', 'Ratatouille', 'perfect', 'opinion', 'Incredibles', 'better', 'film', 'Ratatouille', 'finest', 'film', 'be', 'released', 'cartoon', 'form', 'glorious', 'predecessor', 'know', 'really', 'need', 'see', 'Persepolis', 'will', 'eventually', 'Ratatouille', 'Remy', 'young', 'rat', 'who', 'rest', 'pack', 'really', 'food', 'Sure', 'fellow', 'rats', 'love', 'eat', ""'ll"", 'eat', 'anything', 'Remy', 'only', 'best', 'food', 'can', 'attain', 'picky', 'Living', 'France', 'Remy', 'become', 'fascinated', 'famed', 'chef', 'Auguste', 'Gusteau', 'brokenhearted', 'hear', 'died', 'suddenly', 'receiving', 'scathing', 'review', 'food', 'critic', 'Anton', 'Ego', 'Auguste', 'firmly', 'believed', 'anyone', 'could', 'cook', 'even', 'wrote', 'book', 'effect', 'book', 'Remy', 'would', 'sneak', 'out', 'read', 'When', 'unfortunate', 'event', 'separates', 'Remy', 'family', 'Paris', 'most', 'desirable', 'opportunities', 'paws.Remy', 'late', 'Gusteau', 'restaurant', 'now', 'run', 'sous-chef', 'Skinner', 'man', 'who', 'as', 'intolerable', 'feisty', 'soon', 'propositioned', 'young', 'garbage', 'boy', 'Linguini', 'who', 'thanks', 'Remy', 'been', 'mistaken', 'chef', 'talent', 'been', 'promoted', 'important', 'position', 'Remy', 'talent', 'Linguini', 'human', 'pass', 'off', 'best', 'chef', 'Paris', 'ever', 'seen', 'secret', 'Skinner', 'privy', 'leads', 'work', 'hardest', 'thwart', 'Linguini', 'progress.', 'Ratatouille', 'brilliant', 'job', 'not', 'only', 'delivering', 'state', 'art', 'animation', 'movie', 'BEAUTIFUL', 'look', 'delivering', 'warm', 'touching', 'story', 'real', 'heart', 'characters', 'Remy', 'love', 'food', 'passion', 'determination', 'be', 'disapproval', 'closest', 'namely', 'father', 'admirable', 'importance', 'fighting', 'what', 'believe', 'what', 'know', 'destiny', 'also', 'forward', 'lessons', 'loyalty', 'humility', 'honesty', 'compassion', 'children', 'adults', 'alike', 'are', 'admirable', 'commendable', 'traits', 'should', 'strive', 'achieve.The', 'voice', 'talents', 'enlisted', 'here', 'are', 'superb', 'Patton', 'Oswald', 'delivering', 'magnificently', 'Remy', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'truly', 'stealing', 'show', 'feared', 'critic', 'Anton', 'Ego.With', 'keen', 'eye', 'detail', 'imagery', 'story', 'Ratatouille', 'deserving', 'praise', 'been', 'heaped', 'sturdy', 'shoulders', 'manages', 'be', 'one', 'only', 'cartoons', 'recent', 'years', 'be', 'worthy', 'Animated', 'Feature', 'Oscar', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'Ratatouille', 'year', ""'ll"", 'be', 'crying', 'shame', 'know', 'mediocre', 'best', 'Happy', 'Feet', 'Oscar', 'magical', 'adventure', 'not', 'Well', 'have', 'feeling', 'little', 'rat', 'will', 'run', 'full', 'force', 'podium', 'year', 'accept', 'very', 'well', 'deserved', 'prize']",N/A

1100179,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B000VBJEEG,Andy Orrock,"[0, 0]","'Ratatouille' ranks, in my mind, as the best Pixar film sinceThe Incredibles (Two-Disc Collector's Edition).  It's no surprise that writer-director Brad Bird, possessor of long-standing Disney roots, shaped and directed both of these masterpieces.  It's also thrilling to know that 'Ratatouille' earned not only the respect, but also the glowing admiration of both the French public and its gastronomic elite.  This is a movie that took the time to get the details right and present the French in their rightful role of world leaders in culinary achievements.  If you doubt that, watch the DVD extra with Thomas Keller (a consultant to the film) and note how all his career- and idea-forming experiences were all based in France or of French origin.'Ratatouille' is a movie that can be enjoyed by both kids and adults.  In fact, it seems - by a long stretch - to be the most adult-targeted of all Pixar's works to date.  For example, critic Anton Ego's pronouncements (fleshed out with an amazing voice characterization by Peter O'Toole) are something that would fly 100% over the head of your average eight-year-old.  The single best scene in the movie is when Ego tastes Remy's Ratatouille and is immediately transported into a warm reverie of his mother's similar dish.  That scene gave me goose bumps.

1100181,A4IQXCCXDEAKW,B000VBJEEG,Anne P. Mitchell,"[12, 27]","This movie has it all - it's scary, it's violent, it has making out, alcohol abuse, illegitimate children, and weapons are drawn and used - repeatedly.And it's a G movie!The first inkling of just what kind of movie it will be is during the first scene, when the star of the movie, Remy the Rat (voiced by Patton Oswalt) and his brother Emile (voiced by Peter Sohn) get caught in a farmhouse kitchen, and the previously sweet old lady who is always asleep in her armchair jumps into action and proceeds to unload dozens of rounds from a shotgun at the pair of rats - the shoot `em up scene lasts a good solid 10 minutes, all told, and at several points it looks as if she has blasted the pair into little rat puffs (although in the end she hasn't).All this leads to the entire rat colony having to move out of the farmhouse, and so the next scene is the rat evacuation through the famed sewers of Paris, during which Remy, afloat on a book, ends up going over a scary waterfall, and being tumbled about underwater.Once back on dry land, he scurries along the beams of several buildings - indoors so that we can see down into the various rooms - and passes by a couple who are arguing - the woman aims a pistol at the man, he jeers ""Go ahead, you don't have the guts"", we hear a gunshot, then we see them and it's clear she missed, and they fall into each other's arms and make up.Then ensue many minutes (in two different scenes) of Remy trying to stay alive in a restaurant kitchen. Much hurling and heaving of knives and cleavers. When Remy is finally cornered and caught in a glass jar, his captor is instructed to ""kill him.""This is directed to the newest addition to the kitchen crew, Linguini (voiced by Lou Romano), who turns out to be the illegitimate son of the original owner of the restaurant - now deceased and appearing to Remy as a either a fantastic communication or a figment of Remy's imagination - we're never quite sure which.The female lead, Collete (voiced by Janeane Garofalo), charged with taking Linguini under her wing, advises him ""welcome to hell,"", and then introduces him to the rest of the kitchen crew. One person slept with someone's daughter, another changes his life story every week - each story worse than the other - including that he killed someone. And to get the best produce, we are told, the restaurant ""bribes the grower.""Shall I go on?In order to find out his secret (and secure a hair sample for a DNA test), the head chef gets Linguini drunk, plying him with wine.A drunk Linguini wonders who would ever name a food dish ""ratatouille"", because it sounds so much like ""rat patooty"".Linguini then has a nightmare featuring an evil restaurant critic, who, when asked what he'd like to eat, menacingly says ""I'd like your heart, roasted on a spit.""Of course, Linguini and Colette have a romantic tension going, and there is some fairly in-your-face making out with closeups of kissing and, finally, Linguini pushing Colette up against the seat of her motor scooter, with him nearly laying on top of her. Yeah, it's animated - but yeah, it's pretty overt making out.Meanwhile, to convince Remy that humans are not to be trusted, Remy's father takes Remy to a shop and shows him a window filled with dead rat carcasses hanging from what look like little meathooks. A pretty horrifying visual given that by this time, 3/4s of the way through the movie, all of the children in the audience have bonded with the adorable rats.Frankly, we were shocked that this movie was rated G.Even the children we know who have seen this movie were surprised that it was not rated at least PG, if not PG-13.

We know this theme because it is repeated ad nauseum to stretch out a movie that has nothing else to offer. That is not the only idea that is repeated over and over again. Cooking scenes, the rat being hunted and chased by the head chef, the love/hate dynamics between the two ""human"" leads, all make you wonder when we'll see anything new before the movie ends.

We've seen these themes over and over and over again, and it's becoming a bit tiresome.Instead of a superhero family or a misunderstood ogre, this time we've got an English speaking French rat (don't ask) who's taste for expensive foods -- and not garbage -- gets him into trouble. Living the life of the dull and mundane with the rest of his extended family, Remy (Patton Oswalt,RENO 911!: MIAMI) soon has buckshot whizzing by all of his furry brethren. Removed from his familial upbringing, Remy turns quickly toward his love for rich foods. His astutely attuned nose leads him to Paris (as does a ghostly visitation from a world famous chef known as Gusteau voiced by Brad Garrett,MUSIC AND LYRICS), where he finds a now corrupted and dying restaurant named after its formerly famous cook (the aforementioned Gusteau). He also runs into the newly hired garbage boy named (not funnily) Linguini (Lou Romano,CARS). After being captured in the kitchen, Remy is caged and taken to the river by Linguini where he's told to dispose of the rodent in the nearby river. But Remy and Linguini soon realize they can understand one another, and Linguini can't bring himself to the kill the little fella. What does happen, though, is that a bizarre relationship builds and Linguini quickly becomes the soup chef thanks to Remy's ability to identify delectable food. Hidden under Linguini's hat (literally), rat and human become the master-blaster (ROAD WARRIORreference) of Gusteau's restaurant.Swirling around this story is also a love interest between another chef named Collette (Janeane Garofalo) and Linguini, the battle between thievery and survival that Remy must address when his extended rat family pops in, and, of course, the battle that Linguini must do with a very Tim Burtonesque looking food critic named Anton Ego (the estimable Peter O'Toole,CASANOVA).Not surprisingly, everything works out in the end thanks to human ingenuity and rodent accompaniment.But, again, this isn't something we haven't seen before. It's old terrain covered many times, which is why I'm only giving it 3 stars. Had it not been for the awesome voice of Mr. O'Toole as the food critic, it may not have gotten even that.Kids will enjoy the action. Parents will like the familiar territory. And let's hope that the two can talk about the necessity for rats to NOT be in restaurants.",3,"Same Theme, Same Story",1189123200,"09 7, 2007",2007,2933,"['Maintaining', 'status', 'quo', 'can', 'be', 'damaging', 'films', 'especially', 'thanks', 'highly', 'popular', 'animations', 'have', 'graced', 'silver', 'screen', 'SHREK', 'THE', 'INCREDIBLES', 'HOODWINKED', 'Audiences', 'get', 'bored', 'show', 'same', 'ol', 'same', 'ol', 'where', 'RATATOUILLE', 'trouble.Written', 'directed', 'Brad', 'Bird', 'who', 'also', 'did', 'Incredibles', 'andTHE', 'IRON', 'GIANT', 'Mr.', 'Bird', 'fallen', 'small', 'rut', 'one', 'hope', ""n't"", 'remain', 'Yes', 'animation', 'was', 'great', 'Yes', 'voices', 'were', 'wonderful', 'Yes', 'story', 'was', 'cute', 'funny', 'was', 'nothing', 'new', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'themes', 'over', 'again', 'becoming', 'bit', 'tiresome.Instead', 'superhero', 'family', 'misunderstood', 'ogre', 'time', ""'ve"", 'got', 'English', 'speaking', 'French', 'rat', 'do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'who', 'taste', 'expensive', 'foods', 'not', 'garbage', 'trouble', 'Living', 'life', 'dull', 'mundane', 'rest', 'extended', 'family', 'Remy', 'Patton', 'Oswalt', 'RENO', '911', 'MIAMI', 'soon', 'buckshot', 'whizzing', 'furry', 'brethren', 'Removed', 'familial', 'upbringing', 'Remy', 'quickly', 'love', 'rich', 'foods', 'astutely', 'attuned', 'nose', 'Paris', 'ghostly', 'visitation', 'world', 'famous', 'chef', 'known', 'Gusteau', 'voiced', 'Brad', 'Garrett', 'MUSIC', 'AND', 'LYRICS', 'where', 'now', 'corrupted', 'dying', 'restaurant', 'named', 'formerly', 'famous', 'cook', 'aforementioned', 'Gusteau', 'also', 'newly', 'hired', 'garbage', 'boy', 'named', 'not', 'funnily', 'Linguini', 'Lou', 'Romano', 'CARS', 'being', 'captured', 'kitchen', 'Remy', 'caged', 'taken', 'river', 'Linguini', 'where', 'told', 'dispose', 'rodent', 'nearby', 'river', 'Remy', 'Linguini', 'soon', 'realize', 'can', 'understand', 'one', 'Linguini', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bring', 'kill', 'little', 'fella', 'What', 'happen', 'bizarre', 'relationship', 'builds', 'Linguini', 'quickly', 'soup', 'chef', 'thanks', 'Remy', 'ability', 'identify', 'delectable', 'food', 'Hidden', 'Linguini', 'hat', 'literally', 'rat', 'human', 'become', 'master-blaster', 'ROAD', 'WARRIORreference', 'Gusteau', 'restaurant.Swirling', 'story', 'also', 'love', 'interest', 'chef', 'named', 'Collette', 'Janeane', 'Garofalo', 'Linguini', 'battle', 'thievery', 'survival', 'Remy', 'must', 'address', 'when', 'extended', 'rat', 'family', 'pops', 'course', 'battle', 'Linguini', 'must', 'do', 'very', 'Tim', 'Burtonesque', 'looking', 'food', 'critic', 'named', 'Anton', 'Ego', 'estimable', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'CASANOVA', '.Not', 'surprisingly', 'everything', 'out', 'end', 'thanks', 'human', 'ingenuity', 'rodent', 'accompaniment.But', 'again', ""n't"", 'something', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before', 'old', 'terrain', 'covered', 'many', 'times', 'why', ""'m"", 'only', 'giving', '3', 'stars', 'Had', 'not', 'been', 'awesome', 'voice', 'Mr.', ""O'Toole"", 'food', 'critic', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'gotten', 'even', 'that.Kids', 'will', 'enjoy', 'action', 'Parents', 'will', 'like', 'familiar', 'territory', 'let', 'hope', 'two', 'can', 'talk', 'necessity', 'rats', 'NOT', 'be', 'restaurants']",N/A

This one did not disappoint.  While I do think that it's more of an adult movie, the bright and sometimes eerily realistic animation is also a lot of fun for kids.  My daughter enjoyed it but not nearly as much as my husband and I did!On the surface, this movie is an unlikely story about a rat who dreams of being a chef but the theme is so much more.  It's a story about being true to yourself, about overcoming adversity and following your passion.  Remy isn't perfect but he does have a good heart and he overcomes some very great odds in order to follow his dreams.  This is a wonderful message, no matter how old one may be.The movie also appealed a great deal to the culinary side of myself and my husband.  We love to cook and own many cookbooks and more gadgets than we can count so we really enjoyed listening to Remy talk about the melding of different flavors.  When the movie was over, I wanted to rush right out and enjoy a fine meal and a good glass of wine.  Who knows how many young chefs this movie may inspire.Pixar is simply the best in the business.

Maybe movie-goers are more disgusted by rats than Pixar had anticipated.Anyway, our hero Remy is a rat who lives with his colony in the walls of a cranky old French lady's cottage.  Unlike his many, many relatives, Remy has a refined palate and dreams of being a famous French chef.  In fact, whenever he and his amusingly-gormand brother sneak into the old lady's kitchen, Remy will try to catch his favorite chef's cooking show on television.One fateful day, the colony is disbanded (I'll leave you to discover how).  Alone and disheartened, Remy floats into the waterways of Paris on the back of a cookbook written by his very own hero, the famous chef (who appears to him in encouraging visions).One amusing event leads to another, and soon Remy finds himself living in his hero's very own restaurant!  Soon he embroils himself in a secret partnership with a hapless human busboy who wants to impress a cute pastry chef (who has the most extreme French accent you've ever heard).  Remy will sit under the guy's hat and pull his hair as one might direct a plow horse to guide him according to Remy's advanced cooking knowledge as the young guy attempts to create culinary masterpieces.Several things impressed me about Ratatouille above and beyond its fun, fast-paced plot.  First, I liked how Remy and his human friend never really talk to each other.  The human guy speaks with other humans, Remy speaks with other rats, and the human guy rambles on with Remy the way we all talk to our pets.  But the only direct communication between them is when they first meet and the human guy asks incredulously, ""You can understand me?"" and Remy hesitates, and then gives a quick, nervous nod.Second, the animation is just unbelievably gorgeous.  Look especially at how Pixar does water images.  You will marvel.  Third, I love how the animators perfectly captured the body language and movements of rats.  I've had pet rats, and I'm here to tell you that they move with exactly that sort of plump waddle.

On top of that, the characters are well-drawn (pun intended) and interesting, and the story is engaging - hallmarks of Disney animation.  And, of course, this is a funny movie.  This film is billed as a comedy, and it does not disappoint on that front.However, ""Ratatouille"" has pacing problems, and one villain too many.  The first segment of the movie lasts way too long for the amount of exposition it provides, and could have been left out altogether.  Indeed, it's interesting to watch the deleted scenes and see how Brad Bird initially planned to start the movie in Paris - a choice that probably would have benefitted the movie.  And with two villains, there comes a point 20+ minutes from the end when you abruptly think the movie must be over - but it just keeps coming because there's one more villain to deal with.Nevertheless, ""Ratatouille"" will entertain both adults and children, as Disney films always do, and is at least worth a rent.",4,"Fun, entertaining, but too long",1204416000,"03 2, 2008",2008,1027,"['Ratatouille', 'technical', 'tour', 'force', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'Pixar', 'top', 'characters', 'are', 'well-drawn', 'pun', 'intended', 'interesting', 'story', 'engaging', 'hallmarks', 'Disney', 'animation', 'course', 'funny', 'movie', 'film', 'billed', 'comedy', 'not', 'disappoint', 'front.However', 'Ratatouille', 'pacing', 'problems', 'one', 'villain', 'too', 'many', 'first', 'segment', 'movie', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'amount', 'exposition', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'out', 'altogether', 'Indeed', 'interesting', 'watch', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'see', 'how', 'Brad', 'Bird', 'initially', 'planned', 'start', 'movie', 'Paris', 'choice', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'benefitted', 'movie', 'two', 'villains', 'point', '20+', 'minutes', 'end', 'when', 'abruptly', 'think', 'movie', 'must', 'be', 'just', 'coming', 'one', 'more', 'villain', 'deal', 'with.Nevertheless', 'Ratatouille', 'will', 'entertain', 'adults', 'children', 'Disney', 'films', 'always', 'do', 'least', 'rent']",N/A

Such is the romance of eating. It is the combining of the known to create something previously unknown. Salt, tomatoes, sugar, butter are not unusual, but, in the hands of a master chef, they are ingredients for art.Such is the movie Ratatouille. Its history is the simple, oft-told childhood tale of the elves and the shoemaker. A shoemaker is down on his luck, with one piece of leather left, and, to his great delight, a fine pair of shoes are miraculously made with that leather when he awakes. Can he make those shoes again? Who was the mysterious maker of these fantastic shoes?Ratatouille takes us to a similar difficulty: Linguini, a hapless mid-20s guy who has failed at every job. At the great Gusteau's Restaurant, he becomes a garbage boy. He causes an accident with a pot of soup, and, in trying to fix the problem, makes the soup offensive to even the most plebeian of taste buds. Remy, a rat with culinary sensitivities, secretly adds the ingredients necessary to save the soup.Instead of being fired, Linguini is promoted to cook. Without Remy's help, he cannot cook. With Remy's help, he shows, as the late Chef Gusteau claimed, anyone can cook. Even the garbage boy.Remy's story, though, is the tension between his passion for cooking, and his large family. They are satisfied eating garbage, living on the run, and avoiding kitchens, as that's where the greatest dangers prevails. Reminiscent of Richard Bach's fable ""Jonathan Livingston Seagull,"" Remy wants more than to be what rats have always been. He wants to taste, to smell, to combine two flavors into a new ecstatic sensation. Torn between these two loves, he tries to balance their expectations with his dreams.As Remy's influence through Linguini in the kitchen grows, so does the renewal of Gusteau's Restaurant. It had fallen into the hands of Skinner, the ambitious and evil sous chef, when Gusteau passed away, and he was making it into a tourist locale, and branding frozen burritos with Gusteau's imprimatur. Now, Linguini as the new Gusteau, its reputation was flourishing.Anton Ego, a food critic who despises Gusteau's, is forced to reconsider the restaurant after he thought he had written its death knell years back. With fearful awe, his declaration to return to Gusteau's causes trembling among the cooks and staff.Can Ego's pretentious palate be satiated?Will the conflict with Linguini and Colette, his lover and cook, force bad decisions in the kitchen?Can a restaurant survive if people learn a rat has been running the show?In all, Ratatouille's a remarkable movie that relies on storytelling, not on celebrity voicings, special effects, pop-culture references or cheap humor. It tells an old story a new way, bringing a fresh flavor into a familiar meal, and is soon to be a staple in family DVD collections.

The visuals, the nonstop action, and the hunger-inducing food theme all made this a treat to watch. I even got the urge to cook my very first omelette after the movie was over. (It was somewhat edible.) Even the extras were rather charming.The one thing that keeps me from rating this as a 5 is the characterization. It gave the movie a depressing overtone, as most of the characters' personalities are overdone and don't have very many redeeming qualities. Linguini is a massive dope, Colette is an ice queen with a penchant for stabbing knives through shirt sleeves when she wants to be intimidating (who defrosts only partially by the end of the movie), the head chef is a raving lunatic who acts about ready to brandish a couple of extra large, extra sharp knives of his own, and the rest of the characters are just... grim.

So many films try to entertain their audiences by gratuitous sex, violence and profanity in a race to show the gutter of human existence. Curiously, this film is about the animals of the gutter (rats) and how even the lowest in the class hierarchy can have and pursue grand aspirations.Although this is an animated film, the richness of physical emotional expression of the characters is far superior to that of most films with live actors these days. Perhaps the separation of acting and speaking necessary for an animated film encourages the animators to express themselves visually while the voices are challenged to rise to the quality of the animation in a healthy, mutually fulfilling competition. It harkens back to the early days of talking cinema when the actors still knew how to express themselves visually from the silent film days. It is possible to watch this film without sound and still enjoy it.In short, this film is so rich, that I can hardly wait to add it to my collection. It is a film for all ages and I plan on using it in my foreign language classes with dubbing to help them visually connect feelings, and vocabulary directly to the vicissitudes of life without translating.

This is certainly a good film that has its entertaining moments and is quite memorable; however, it's nothing groundbreaking and certainly not a film that's worthy of 5 star status.Remy is a sewer rat who's told by his family and friends that he must live off scraps of any food he can find. His family and friends can live this way without a problem, but Remy has a problem, he has an excelled sense of smell which means he can't bare to try the scraps that he's taught he must eat to survive. Remy, against the wishes of his Father, Remy endeavours to find new flavours by smelling and mixing different foods, but to do this he must enter the humans territory. He constantly enters the home of an elderly woman to borrow some flavourings, On his numerous trips there he reads a recipe book by a nationally famous French Chef, Gusteau. Gusteau inspires Remy to keep trying new mixtures of flavourings and ingredients. During one of his regular trips to the humans home, Remy brings his brother along and the woman wakes up to spot the rats rummaging through her cupboards. She brings out a gun and starts shooting at them both, which leads to her ceiling collapsing revealing hundred of rats who have been living in her attic. While all the rats are running, Remy is left behind and goes the wrong way down a sewer which leads him to Paris, right outside Gusteau's restaurant.Gusteau's restaurant is in trouble as due to a recent negative review from a really tough critic the restaurant is bumped from 5 stars down to 3 which leads to the death of Gusteau. Remy finds himself in the kitchen of Gusteau's fixing a soup that was accidentally ruined by the Garbage Boy Linguini who's the nephew of Gusteau. The soup becomes a success and Linguini takes the credit as the minute Remy was spotted he was taken away by Linguini to prevent him being killed. They form an unlikely bond that leads them down a slippery slope filled with comedy, love and revenge.Now, like I said this film is a pretty good movie but it's nowhere nears the greatness that it's been described as by many critics. To be honest it's the typical Disney plot line sugar coated in a new story and new characters; to some this may be fine and you may still enjoy the whole ""facing tragedy we all come together and make it work"" story, but quite frankly I'm finding it dull. Unlike others I didn't buy this right away as I knew what to expect, I knew I would only get a new storyline, but before I'd even bought it I had worked out the ending. I love the Disney/Pixar films and I'm a big fan of The Incredibles, Cars and Monsters Inc. But this film, I just didn't see the magic that I felt from the three aforementioned movies.My little niece watched this film with me, and naturally she loved it, but I felt robbed. I know it's a kids movie, but I still expected to like this film as much as I did the other 3 Disney/Pixar movies especially considering how good some of the reviews were.If you're thinking of buying this for a young relative then I would highly recommend it, but if you're looking for an innocent film that's going to recapture the magic of any previous Disney/Pixar collaborations than this is something that you should stay away from",4,Good But Not Groundbreaking,1206662400,"03 28, 2008",2008,3346,"['film', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'had', 'nothing', 'rave', 'reviews', 'most', 'professional', 'critics', 'Amazon', 'critics', 'alike', 'certainly', 'good', 'film', 'entertaining', 'moments', 'quite', 'memorable', 'however', 'nothing', 'groundbreaking', 'certainly', 'not', 'film', 'worthy', '5', 'star', 'status.Remy', 'sewer', 'rat', 'who', 'told', 'family', 'friends', 'must', 'live', 'off', 'scraps', 'food', 'can', 'find', 'family', 'friends', 'can', 'live', 'way', 'problem', 'Remy', 'problem', 'excelled', 'sense', 'smell', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bare', 'try', 'scraps', 'taught', 'must', 'eat', 'survive', 'Remy', 'wishes', 'Father', 'Remy', 'find', 'new', 'flavours', 'smelling', 'mixing', 'different', 'foods', 'do', 'must', 'enter', 'humans', 'territory', 'constantly', 'home', 'elderly', 'woman', 'borrow', 'flavourings', 'numerous', 'trips', 'there', 'recipe', 'book', 'nationally', 'famous', 'French', 'Chef', 'Gusteau', 'Gusteau', 'Remy', 'keep', 'trying', 'new', 'mixtures', 'flavourings', 'ingredients', 'one', 'regular', 'trips', 'humans', 'home', 'Remy', 'brother', 'woman', 'up', 'spot', 'rats', 'rummaging', 'cupboards', 'out', 'gun', 'shooting', 'ceiling', 'collapsing', 'revealing', 'hundred', 'rats', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'living', 'attic', 'rats', 'are', 'running', 'Remy', 'left', 'wrong', 'way', 'down', 'sewer', 'Paris', 'right', 'Gusteau', 'restaurant.Gusteau', 'restaurant', 'trouble', 'due', 'recent', 'negative', 'review', 'really', 'tough', 'critic', 'restaurant', 'bumped', '5', 'stars', 'down', '3', 'death', 'Gusteau', 'Remy', 'kitchen', 'Gusteau', 'fixing', 'soup', 'was', 'accidentally', 'ruined', 'Garbage', 'Boy', 'Linguini', 'who', 'nephew', 'Gusteau', 'soup', 'success', 'Linguini', 'credit', 'minute', 'Remy', 'was', 'spotted', 'was', 'taken', 'away', 'Linguini', 'prevent', 'being', 'killed', 'form', 'unlikely', 'bond', 'down', 'slippery', 'slope', 'filled', 'comedy', 'love', 'revenge.Now', 'said', 'film', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'nowhere', 'greatness', 'been', 'described', 'many', 'critics', 'be', 'honest', 'typical', 'Disney', 'plot', 'line', 'sugar', 'coated', 'new', 'story', 'new', 'characters', 'may', 'be', 'fine', 'may', 'still', 'enjoy', 'whole', 'facing', 'tragedy', 'come', 'together', 'make', 'work', 'story', 'quite', 'frankly', ""'m"", 'finding', 'dull', 'others', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'right', 'away', 'knew', 'what', 'expect', 'knew', 'would', 'only', 'get', 'new', 'storyline', ""'d"", 'even', 'bought', 'had', 'worked', 'out', 'ending', 'love', 'Disney/Pixar', 'films', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'Incredibles', 'Cars', 'Monsters', 'Inc', 'film', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'magic', 'felt', 'three', 'aforementioned', 'movies.My', 'little', 'niece', 'watched', 'film', 'naturally', 'loved', 'felt', 'robbed', 'know', 'kids', 'movie', 'still', 'expected', 'like', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'other', '3', 'Disney/Pixar', 'movies', 'especially', 'considering', 'how', 'good', 'reviews', 'were.If', ""'re"", 'thinking', 'buying', 'young', 'relative', 'then', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', ""'re"", 'looking', 'innocent', 'film', 'going', 'recapture', 'magic', 'previous', 'Disney/Pixar', 'collaborations', 'something', 'should', 'stay', 'away']",N/A

What makes this film unique, like all Pixar movies, is that technical detail is used to accentuate a great comic script with heart. I would say other computer animated movies do the reverse, but then I would be saying that they have great scripts with heart, which they generally don't. Like all Pixar films there is something here for the whole family, the kids can enjoy it for the shear comic spectacle, such as when Remy the rat discovers he can control the boy Linguini like a marionette by pulling hairs under his hat and thus cook meals via remote control, and the adults can enjoy the comedy plus the irony of a rat who dreams of preparing fine food and how sometimes your own personal dreams can clash with family loyalty and society's expectations.

Mom""","[1, 1]","How pathetic is the mindset and state of our movie-making industry these days that the cleverest, most creative movie storytelling comes from the creators of animated features like this one?  It's almost as if they are the only ones who remember how to do a completely original concept, create engaging characters and witty dialogue, and a gorgeously realized world for it all to happen. So what if the Paris of ""Ratatouille"" is more the Paris of dreams - it's a movie, a place to spend time in, imagining that it all really does look like that, a sparkling city spread out below the rooftop of a walk-up flat with the view of the Seine. That's what movies are for, to delight, engage and entertain.It does help to be a bit of a foodie: as my daughter observed, upon noting  the quick throwaway bit of Chef Gusteau on the covers of certain magazines - ""Mom, do you realize we have every one of those magazines in the house?"" If ever there was a movie that would give you the serious munchies, this is it. Ratatouille may not the first big foodie movie, but it is definitely the first animated foodie movie, and luscious on every level. Visually, it's a feast; The Paris skyline cannot possibly look as beautiful in real life as it does here, in this tale of a young rat with dreams beyond his station in life.Remy (voiced by Patton Oswalt) has a discriminating palate, and an unstoppable urge to be a chef, inspired by a cookbook ""Anyone Can Cook"" written by late five-star chef Auguste Gusteau and watching too many hours of the French version of the Food Network. When Remy and his whole rat-clan must depart their country home at speed, Remy is separated from the other rats. By chance, he finds his way through the sewers of Paris, and winds up in the holy of holies: Chef Gusteau's restaurant kitchen, now run by his none-too-ethical senior, Chef Skinner (voiced by Ian Holm).He teams up with the very junior Linguini (voice of Lou Romano), the garbage-boy, pot-washer and general help, desperately inept and just as desperate to keep his job. While Remy can understand Linguini and human speech in general, Linguini cannot understand him. But with practice, they work a means; Remy sits on his head and pulls at his hair; he is the chef, Linguini his means.This is one of those animated movies with an absolutely painterly aesthetic, as complicated and gorgeous as one of those 19th century academic visions. The restaurant kitchen where much of the action takes place is a real, tactile place, and the action is non-stop. I am left to wonder if Anthony Bourdain's Kitchen Confidential had some influence, especially with the characters of the other kitchen staff. It would have been nice to for them to have had a little more of the action, but never mind. I am sure I missed most of the sight gags, on the first time through. This is another one of those rare and lovely movie treasures like Chicken Run,  which adults and children can enjoy together... although they probably will be laughing at different things.Bonus features included in the DVD release unfortunately do not include either of the two trailers. One incorporated the priceless line ""It's not too bad once you muscle past the gag reflex""; the endearing lament of a foodie longing after better things! Features do include the hilarious short ""Lifted"", a short feature hosted by Remy and his brother Emile ""Your Friend the Rat"",  cheerfully outlining the history of human-rat relationships, and another called ""Fine Food and Film"". That feature is a behind-the-scenes look at the similarities between creating fine food and fine animation; among them tireless attention to small detail and creative passion being but two of them. The deleted scenes are not really deleted, fully animated scenes, but rather animated black and white preliminary sketches of scenes that were considered, but not considered essential. All in all, well worth waiting for, and watching over and over.",5,Everything But the Recipe,1243123200,"05 24, 2009",2009,3951,"['How', 'pathetic', 'mindset', 'state', 'movie-making', 'industry', 'days', 'cleverest', 'most', 'creative', 'movie', 'storytelling', 'creators', 'animated', 'features', 'one', 'almost', 'are', 'only', 'ones', 'who', 'remember', 'how', 'do', 'completely', 'original', 'concept', 'create', 'engaging', 'characters', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'gorgeously', 'realized', 'world', 'happen', 'So', 'what', 'Paris', 'Ratatouille', 'more', 'Paris', 'dreams', 'movie', 'place', 'spend', 'time', 'imagining', 'really', 'look', 'sparkling', 'city', 'spread', 'rooftop', 'walk-up', 'flat', 'view', 'Seine', 'what', 'movies', 'are', 'delight', 'engage', 'entertain.It', 'help', 'be', 'bit', 'foodie', 'daughter', 'observed', 'noting', 'quick', 'throwaway', 'bit', 'Chef', 'Gusteau', 'covers', 'certain', 'magazines', 'Mom', 'do', 'realize', 'have', 'one', 'magazines', 'house', 'ever', 'was', 'movie', 'would', 'give', 'serious', 'munchies', 'Ratatouille', 'may', 'not', 'first', 'big', 'foodie', 'movie', 'definitely', 'first', 'animated', 'foodie', 'movie', 'luscious', 'level', 'Visually', 'feast', 'Paris', 'skyline', 'can', 'not', 'possibly', 'look', 'beautiful', 'real', 'life', 'here', 'tale', 'young', 'rat', 'dreams', 'station', 'life.Remy', 'voiced', 'Patton', 'Oswalt', 'discriminating', 'palate', 'unstoppable', 'urge', 'be', 'chef', 'inspired', 'cookbook', 'Anyone', 'Can', 'Cook', 'written', 'late', 'five-star', 'chef', 'Auguste', 'Gusteau', 'watching', 'too', 'many', 'hours', 'French', 'version', 'Food', 'Network', 'When', 'Remy', 'whole', 'rat-clan', 'must', 'depart', 'country', 'home', 'speed', 'Remy', 'separated', 'other', 'rats', 'chance', 'way', 'sewers', 'Paris', 'up', 'holy', 'holies', 'Chef', 'Gusteau', 'restaurant', 'kitchen', 'now', 'run', 'none-too-ethical', 'senior', 'Chef', 'Skinner', 'voiced', 'Ian', 'Holm', '.He', 'teams', 'up', 'very', 'junior', 'Linguini', 'voice', 'Lou', 'Romano', 'garbage-boy', 'pot-washer', 'general', 'help', 'desperately', 'inept', 'just', 'as', 'desperate', 'keep', 'job', 'Remy', 'can', 'understand', 'Linguini', 'human', 'speech', 'general', 'Linguini', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'practice', 'work', 'means', 'Remy', 'head', 'pulls', 'hair', 'chef', 'Linguini', 'means.This', 'one', 'animated', 'movies', 'absolutely', 'painterly', 'aesthetic', 'complicated', 'gorgeous', 'one', '19th', 'century', 'academic', 'visions', 'restaurant', 'kitchen', 'where', 'much', 'action', 'place', 'real', 'tactile', 'place', 'action', 'non-stop', 'am', 'left', 'wonder', 'Anthony', 'Bourdain', 'Kitchen', 'Confidential', 'had', 'influence', 'especially', 'characters', 'other', 'kitchen', 'staff', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'have', 'had', 'little', 'more', 'action', 'never', 'mind', 'am', 'sure', 'missed', 'most', 'sight', 'gags', 'first', 'time', 'one', 'rare', 'lovely', 'movie', 'treasures', 'Chicken', 'Run', 'adults', 'children', 'can', 'enjoy', 'together', 'probably', 'will', 'be', 'laughing', 'different', 'things.Bonus', 'features', 'included', 'DVD', 'release', 'unfortunately', 'do', 'not', 'include', 'two', 'trailers', 'One', 'incorporated', 'priceless', 'line', 'not', 'too', 'bad', 'once', 'muscle', 'gag', 'reflex', 'endearing', 'lament', 'foodie', 'longing', 'better', 'things', 'Features', 'do', 'include', 'hilarious', 'short', 'Lifted', 'short', 'feature', 'hosted', 'Remy', 'brother', 'Emile', 'Friend', 'Rat', 'cheerfully', 'outlining', 'history', 'human-rat', 'relationships', 'called', 'Fine', 'Food', 'Film', 'feature', 'behind-the-scenes', 'look', 'similarities', 'creating', 'fine', 'food', 'fine', 'animation', 'tireless', 'attention', 'small', 'detail', 'creative', 'passion', 'being', 'two', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'deleted', 'fully', 'animated', 'scenes', 'rather', 'animated', 'black', 'white', 'preliminary', 'sketches', 'scenes', 'were', 'considered', 'not', 'considered', 'essential', 'well', 'worth', 'waiting', 'watching']",N/A

1100232,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000VBJEEG,Chris Pandolfi,"[7, 11]","Rats have always been associated with filth: they live in sewers; they eat out of the garbage; they've probably been exposed to a disease. Is it any wonder that we cringe at the thought of a rat touching the food we eat? One of the things that makes Disney/Pixar's ""Ratatouille"" so interesting is that this idea is intentionally turned on its head: it's about a rat with a passion for food and a talent for cooking. This story is told with charm, style, and a generous dose of humor, made even better through wonderful animation and decent voice work. I won't go so far as to say that this is the greatest Disney/Pixar film ever made, but I will say that--like all that have come before it--it's a well made film that's a lot of fun to watch.This film cleverly breaks a clear distinction between humans and non-humans, the kind that was first demonstrated in ""Toy Story."" In that film, the toys' cardinal rule was to never let a human see them walk and talk. Humans have come to believe that toys are inanimate objects; they will never be able to accept anything different. ""Ratatouille"" opens with the same basic principle: a rat can never interact with a human. Humans think that rats are dirty, vile creatures; they will never think otherwise. Or would they? The story centers on the unlikely relationship between a rat--Remy (Patton Oswalt)--and a human--Linguini (Lou Romano)--a relationship that clearly violates the rules of species interaction. Both characters are motivated by the desire to prove something.Most of the film takes place in the kitchen of a troubled Parisian restaurant that was once worthy of five stars. This is where Remy winds up after being separated from his clan (the end result of a trigger-happy old woman ridding her house of vermin). This is dream come true for the little rat; Remy has always appreciated food, from the smells to the flavors to the various combinations of ingredients. He was born to be a chef. While trying to escape from the kitchen, he gets distracted by a pot of soup in desperate need of assistance. As he adds the final ingredient, he's caught by Linguini, a stumbling, bumbling wreck recently hired as a garbage collector. While he's able to prevent Remy from being seen, he's too late to prevent the soup from being served. But to everyone's surprise, the soup is a big hit with the customers.Later that night, when alone, Remy and Linguini discover that they can communicate with each other. This is good news for Linguini; the restaurant staff believed that he cooked the wonderful soup, and the head chef--the tiny, high-strung, power-hungry Skinner (Ian Holm)--wants him to cook it again the next day. This is when Linguini and Remy form a secret partnership: Remy will be the brains behind the recipes, and Linguini will physically cook the meals.This sets into motion the more comedic portions of the film, portions highlighted by Remy's literal puppetry of Linguini. While hiding underneath a toque, Remy is able to manipulate Linguini's arms by pulling locks of his hair. I don't think I fully appreciated the slapstick nature of these scenes; hidden beneath the talking animals and formulaic plot is a story that's more mature. I greatly appreciated the themes of friendship and cooperation, and I certainly enjoyed the developing relationship between Linguini and the aggressive yet vulnerable Colette (Janeane Garofalo). But when it comes to the comical results of Remy's puppetry, something was lacking. Maybe it was the fact that Linguini had already been established as a funny character. Nothing further was needed.But that's my only real criticism of ""Ratatouille."" The rest of the film is pleasing and light, as is expected of all family-oriented animated films. Some of the best moments involve Remy's conversations with the imaginary spirit of Gusteau (Brad Garrett), a world-class chef and founder of the restaurant. He appears whenever Remy needs a pep talk, specifically when it comes to the assertion that anyone can be a cook if he or she is in the right mindset. This character acts as a counterpoint to Remy's father, Django (Brian Dennehy), who's always unsupportive and unsatisfied. He would prefer to see his son eat garbage and avoid human contact like every other rat. But Remy is independent, and he's determined to show his father that (a) not all humans are bad, and (b) that he can make something of himself.Unfortunately, doing so will mean having to work with Linguini, who's now letting the restaurant's success go to his head. Making matters even worse is Skinner; not only does he suspect Remy's involvement, he also panics at the prospect of Linguini taking ownership of the restaurant (for reasons I won't reveal). The biggest obstacle for all the characters is food critic Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole), a sinister and somehow ghoulish old man. Many years ago, he wrote a scathing review of the restaurant, forcing it to drop one of its stars (another was dropped when Gusteau died). The restaurant's recent rise in popularity has come to his attention, as has the publicity surrounding Linguini. Using every mannerism of a horror movie villain, Ego personally challenges Linguini to prepare a dish worthy of a good review.Thus, the groundwork is laid for the film's ending, which is just as amusing as it is far fetched. But plausibility doesn't even come into play here; this is a fun-filled animated film, perfect for children and generally well suited for adults. No one will care that a language barrier between French and English was completely ignored. No one will mind that only certain characters speak with a French accent. ""Ratatouille"" was appropriately crafted so that Remy, Linguini, and their fateful partnership will be all anyone cares about.",4,"If Rat Can Cook, You Can, Too",1181952000,"06 16,

1100239,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000VBJEEG,"Cloud ""...""","[1, 2]","Despite the fact that they have 5 films under their belt, I always felt the Pixar films directed by Brad Bird were some of the best that came out of the studio. Not that he does anything completely left of center but they somehow feel different in spirit than the studio's regular output with the ""Incredibles"" being my favorite film they've done. Now comes ""Ratatouille"", Bird's follow-up to that superhero movie and Pixar's followup to the uncharacteristically-average ""Cars"". Since that film wasn't that well received, Ratatouille didn't look promising either until it became, deservingly, one of the best-reviewed films of the year.Remy is a rat living in the French countryside with his family living off of garbage. But with a gift for smell and taste, Remy has more higher standards for the kind of food he eats. But when he's seperated from his family and finds himself under Paris' restaurant, Gusteau's, home of Remy's idol and with the motto ""anyone can cook!"", Remy feels right at home. That is of course if people can accept a rat in the kitchen, much less cooking their food. But with the help of socially inept and cooking-challenged Linguini, Remy and Linguini become friends and kitchen stars which attracts the attention of ambitious chef Skinner and harsh food critic Anton Ego.Whereas the Incredibles was more action-packed than any other Pixar outing, Ratatouille almost has a more romantic comedy/buddy movie feel and it feels more unique than A Bug's Life or Finding Nemo. There isn't that one obvious comic relief character and the film doesn't end in a glorious action sequence so while the kids might find it too character-driven, adults might find it more delightful that the film speaks to the audience and not down at them with bad puns and pop culture references. From colorful characters and a lighthearted but not saccharine tone, the film seems quite at home with anyone.It's kind of a cliche now to point out Pixar has become the best in computer animation. Whereas Dreamworks and the folks behind Robots and Ice Age do have impressive animation, at times there's things such as texture or subtleties that make them far behind. And it's fair to say Ratatouille is probably their most accomplished and it's all to do with character animation and nuances. Sure there's things like the slightly translucent flesh tone that the rat's ear has to the differences between wet fur, dry fur and whatnot but the characters feel more realistic. One of my favorite parts is when a character is about to slap another but stops and it's just as good an acting job as live-action. Then of course there's the food. Don't watch on an empty stomach.If there's one knock, it's the special features. While they have double-dipped in the past, Monsters Inc. to the Incredibles were always filled with featurettes and documentaries about the making-of. But since Cars, the films seem light on anything. Sure we get the funny short ""Lifted"", a new short and whatnot but it's not as packed as I would like it to be. There's not even a commentary and as anyone who's heard Bird talk, he's a very...animated fellow (no pun intended) and to hear him talk about the film would've been welcome.It might not have the wide-reaching appeal Toy Story has but for anyone looking for a great animated film, can't go wrong with this one.",5,One of my favorite films of 2007,1194307200,"11 6, 2007",2007,3335,"['fact', 'have', '5', 'films', 'belt', 'always', 'felt', 'Pixar', 'films', 'directed', 'Brad', 'Bird', 'were', 'best', 'came', 'studio', 'Not', 'anything', 'completely', 'left', 'center', 'somehow', 'feel', 'different', 'spirit', 'studio', 'regular', 'output', 'Incredibles', 'being', 'favorite', 'film', ""'ve"", 'done', 'Now', 'Ratatouille', 'Bird', 'follow-up', 'superhero', 'movie', 'Pixar', 'followup', 'uncharacteristically-average', 'Cars', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'that', 'well', 'received', 'Ratatouille', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'promising', 'either', 'became', 'deservingly', 'one', 'best-reviewed', 'films', 'year.Remy', 'rat', 'living', 'French', 'countryside', 'family', 'living', 'garbage', 'gift', 'smell', 'taste', 'Remy', 'more', 'higher', 'standards', 'kind', 'food', 'when', 'seperated', 'family', 'Paris', 'restaurant', 'Gusteau', 'home', 'Remy', 'idol', 'motto', 'anyone', 'can', 'cook', 'Remy', 'feels', 'right', 'home', 'course', 'people', 'can', 'accept', 'rat', 'kitchen', 'much', 'less', 'cooking', 'food', 'help', 'socially', 'inept', 'cooking-challenged', 'Linguini', 'Remy', 'Linguini', 'become', 'friends', 'kitchen', 'stars', 'attention', 'ambitious', 'chef', 'Skinner', 'harsh', 'food', 'critic', 'Anton', 'Ego.Whereas', 'Incredibles', 'was', 'more', 'action-packed', 'other', 'Pixar', 'outing', 'Ratatouille', 'almost', 'more', 'romantic', 'comedy/buddy', 'movie', 'feel', 'more', 'unique', 'Bug', 'Life', 'Finding', 'Nemo', ""n't"", 'one', 'obvious', 'comic', 'relief', 'character', 'film', ""n't"", 'end', 'glorious', 'action', 'sequence', 'so', 'kids', 'might', 'find', 'too', 'character-driven', 'adults', 'might', 'find', 'more', 'delightful', 'film', 'audience', 'not', 'down', 'bad', 'puns', 'pop', 'culture', 'references', 'colorful', 'characters', 'lighthearted', 'not', 'saccharine', 'tone', 'film', 'quite', 'home', 'anyone.It', 'kind', 'cliche', 'now', 'point', 'out', 'Pixar', 'become', 'best', 'computer', 'animation', 'Whereas', 'Dreamworks', 'folks', 'Robots', 'Ice', 'Age', 'do', 'have', 'impressive', 'animation', 'times', 'things', 'such', 'texture', 'subtleties', 'make', 'far', 'fair', 'say', 'Ratatouille', 'probably', 'most', 'accomplished', 'do', 'character', 'animation', 'nuances', 'Sure', 'things', 'slightly', 'translucent', 'flesh', 'tone', 'rat', 'ear', 'differences', 'wet', 'fur', 'dry', 'fur', 'whatnot', 'characters', 'feel', 'more', 'realistic', 'One', 'favorite', 'parts', 'when', 'character', 'slap', 'stops', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'acting', 'job', 'live-action', 'Then', 'course', 'food', 'Do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'empty', 'stomach.If', 'one', 'knock', 'special', 'features', 'have', 'double-dipped', 'past', 'Monsters', 'Inc.', 'Incredibles', 'were', 'always', 'filled', 'featurettes', 'documentaries', 'making-of', 'Cars', 'films', 'seem', 'light', 'anything', 'Sure', 'get', 'funny', 'short', 'Lifted', 'new', 'short', 'whatnot', 'not', 'as', 'packed', 'would', 'like', 'be', 'not', 'even', 'commentary', 'anyone', 'who', 'heard', 'Bird', 'talk', 'very', 'animated', 'fellow', 'pun', 'intended', 'hear', 'talk', 'film', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'welcome.It', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'wide-reaching', 'appeal', 'Toy', 'Story', 'anyone', 'looking', 'great', 'animated', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'one']",N/A

He is a gourmand - sneaking into a human's kitchen to read her cookbooks, trying various mushrooms to try and find the best match to his cheese, etc.  When he ends up in Paris, he finds Gusteau's restaurant in a declining state - savaged by the critic Ego, with a head chef more interested in developing microwave burritoes than in cooking fine food.The biggest hurdle to enjoying this film, as mentioned in the Amazon description, is the fact that this movie is about rats.  Hundreds of them in some scenes.  Ironically, it's the success of the advances in computer animation that makes it difficult - these are not the rodents of ""The Rescuers"".  They are much more realistic and even I, who have no particular aversion to rats, was a little creeped out by the hyper-realism of Remy's rippling fur.Ultimately the story comes down to the conflict between Remy (and his human avatar Linguini) and the critic Ego.  The resolution of this conflict is so surprisingly satisfying and effective that it redeems the entire film, which is otherwise not particularly original.I can also report that this film works well for children.  Although too dialogue-heavy for really young children, my son inserted the film into his regular rotation starting about age 4.  It's not requested as much as Cars (obviously!) but it's certainly watched more often than Bug's Life, Monsters Inc., or Aladdin.This DVD has a couple of really good extras - the short ""Lifted"" (which, again, my 4-year-old loves) and the promo short ""Your Friend the Rat"".  But these two short films - grand total of maybe 15 minutes - is the sum total of all the extras.  There are no making-of featurettes, no director's commentary, etc.  For children, I'm sure they don't care.

I mean a story about a rat who cooks?  Rats around human food are most everyone's nightmare, but Remy (Patton Oswalt) is a rat whose food you would want to taste.  He is a rat you would like to get to know.  Remy is a rat we want to see in at least one sequel!Remy's father, Django (Brian Dennehy), is the leader of their huge rat clan.  They scavenge where they can and stay out of sight of humans as much as they can.  Emile (Peter Sohn) is Remy's not too bright brother who is happy to eat anything almost constantly.  Remy has become a fan of a once great French Chef named Gusteau (Brad Garrett) who died of a broken heart shortly after his masterpiece ""Anyone Can Cook"" was published and panned by the feared food critic Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole).By the time fate gets Remy to Gusteau's restaurant, it is an institution for the tourists, although the cooks there care in their own way.  Chef Skinner managed to take the place over and is gearing up to market Gusteau's image on a variety of frozen foods.This is as far as I want to take you in setting up the story.  Well, one more thing.  A young man named Linguini shows up looking for any job.  His mother has died and she was a friend of Gusteau's, so he gets a job cleaning up.  Remy and Linguini form as close a friendship as a rat and a young man can have, given the language barriers and all.  However, it does help that Remy can understand humans and can even read.This is a movie I have watched several times already and is still very enjoyable.  Superbly done in every way.

1100250,A8S11VP9Z36D6,B000VBJEEG,"Dave ""Davelandweb""","[1, 1]","""Ratatouille"" was way above my expectations when I saw it the first time. The previews didn't do much for me, however, the initial buzz was favorable so I shelled out the bucks to watch it in the theater. Now with the DVD, I can enjoy it at home--the surround sound just jumps out - a very good dynamic mix with the excellent score by Michael Giacchino). There aren't too many extras, but what is there is enjoyable. The Pixar short ""Lifted"" about an alien in training attempting an abduction is cute; it amazes me how Pixar is able to capture the emotion and human movements of their 3D animated characters; something that the other studios don't quite have down yet. ""Lifted"" was the short shown with ""Ratatouille"" in the theaters. There is also a another short called ""Your Friend the Rat,"" which is the story of rats through history, showing them not to be the despicable creatures that humans make them out to be. The style of this short is traditional animation (other than the intro/ending by Remy & Emile) and very well done. I really like the sketch-like style that is used here. The DVD also has a 13:53 minute featurette that cuts between Pixar's Brad Bird and French Laundry's Thomas Keller. It is truly interesting to hear the two discuss their respective fields, and seeing just how similar the creative process and philosophies are. There are also 3 deleted scenes; all of them in rough b&w; sketch form. 2 (""Meet Gusteau"" and ""First Day"") deserved to be deleted. The scene titled ""Chez Gusteau"" harkens back to Hitchcock, as the camera takes you to Gusteau's restaurant, through the front door and into the kitchen, all in one continuous ""take."" Even in the rough form, it was great fun to watch. Yet, I understand Bird's explanation that although a good scene, it didn't fit with the perspective he wanted ""Ratatouille"" to have. And that my friends is it for the extras. Not fantastic, but again, what is there is solid.Onto the movie--I found myself enjoying the characters. Amazon.com didn't seem to like the critic character, Anton Ego (voiced by Peter O'Toole). Personally, I found him to be one of my favorites. He helped add a little dark ""spice"" to the movie that otherwise could have been too bland. Briefly, ""Ratatouille"" is about a rat who loves food, and idolizes the late Chef Gusteau. When he ends up in Paris, he teams up with a klutz, Linguini (voiced by Lou Romano) and helps him become a great chef in Gusteau's restaurant.

Was there more violence, compared to previous Pixar adventures?  Yes.  Was it a rat in the kitchen, supporting a possibly disease laden food supply?  Yes.  Was it more adult than other Pixar movies?  A RESOUNDING yes.I think Pixar is realizing that not all movies have to be aimed at children, but ""young-at-heart"" is going to be a cash cow.  I loved this movie.  I read many complaints about this one, from ""violent"" to ""too loud"".  All I can say to those people is ""get over it...""  It was neither.  Violent?  Please...  Disney's (Pixar's PARENT, people...) ""Little Mermaid"" had as much violence in the kitchen when Chef Louis was going after Sebastian.  Horror?  How about when Ursula was stabbed by the boat's bow in the tempest?  These people need to get lives.  They watch as much violence on TV, and they let their kids watch the Japanese Yu-Gi-Oh, Transformers, Pikachu, Harry Potter, (not to mention the totally anti-Christian belief in ""super-powers"" and witchcraft, but I'm not going THERE!) the list goes on....

1100256,A15IQNTQX7QYQA,B000VBJEEG,"David W. Shelton ""David W. Shelton is a write...","[3, 5]","I never thought I'd be cheering on a rat. But when a rat is concocted by a Bird, all the rules change. Ratatouille, the new film from the on-again marriage of Pixar and Disney, has proven once again that an original story can be delicious.After his astonishing success with The Iron Giant and the smash hit of The Incredibles, Brad Bird clearly had a tough act to follow. With Giant, he proved he could tell a story. With The Incredibles, he showed that he wasn't a one-hit wonder. With Ratatouille, he's firmly established himself as a master chef of animation brilliance.All right, I'll stop gushing for a minute. This new tale of a rat who just wants to cook begins humbly enough as Remy (voiced by comedian Patton Oswalt), the film's blue-furred star, jumps out the window of a French country house. He's not particularly cute, but his enhanced sense of taste and smell has given him a special place among his colony. To their delight, they discovered early on that he can smell rat poison.It's a demeaning and dreary beginning for Remy's newfound skills. He wants something more, and we hope for the same. As a rat, he has to take every risk imaginable to get closer to the finer foods. These are the same risks that Bird takes since a story about a rat is about as appealing as a story about a talking spider and pig, at least when first pitched.The brilliance of Ratatouille isn't in the animation, the characters, or even the food. Its genius is in its mere concept. Truly, it's a concept that we can all pursue our passion; a lesson I've taught on many occasions. Remy's passion is to cook. And he'd find any way he can to do exactly that.As he stumbles upon a particularly bad batch of soup, Remy did the unthinkable; he fixed it. In the process, he's discovered by Linguini (Lou Romano), a lanky red-haired boy who's just been begrudgingly hired by a popular restaurant as a garbage boy. The two unlikely heroes begin an even-more-unlikely friendship which elevates the story from a tasty hor'dourve into the stratosphere as the film version of a culinary masterpiece.Bird clearly knows that any food can be made to look pretty, but it's the taste and texture that really matters. With Ratatouille, he's given us a dish that is as rich as it is gorgeous, as tasty as it is meaty. This isn't a cream puff, it's a film that's worthy of repeat viewings by people of all walks of life, and of all ages.What's particularly interesting is that Disney chose to allow Bird to use a voice cast that's heavy on talent, but light on blockbuster star value. The biggest names attached to Ratatouille are Lord of the Ring's Ian Holm who voices the diminutive Skinner and Lawrence of Arabia's Peter O'Toole who provides the dialogue for the ultra-picky food critic, Anton Ego.By the end of the film, we're not only rooting for a rat, but we're actually celebrating being different. So many of us can relate to this silly rodent, and who could resist such a message of hope? Without being preachy, Bird delivers Ratatouille as a message of thinking outside the box, and even daring to live outside of any box, with the finesse and deliberate touch of a master chef.

Brad Bird succeeds once again with Ratatouille after the great-beyond-measure The Incredibles.Despite an unconvincing main character which is a low-down rat and a talentless son of a cook, the animated film manages to fill each and every scene with action and fun, something that is bound to keep kids riveted. On a higher level, the storyline will appeal to adults in its subtle complexity. It speaks of nature vs nurture (are rats are forever condemned to being thieves), believing in oneself's aspirations (Anyone can cook even a street rat), imagine and create (Gusteau: I'm a figment of your imagination...If you're focused on what you've left behind, you will not be able to see what lies ahed. Now go up, and look around!). The dialogues are witty and of course, the animation is superb.At the end of Ratatouille, you would have experienced failure and then emerge hopeful.

As with every Pixar production, the animation is superb, the characters are compelling and the story resound with everyone. Also, the humor is great.Remy is a rat that dreams to become a chef and his opportunity comes when he meets Linguini, a garbage boy who wants to keep his job. Together, they become the finest chef in France but problems arise in the restaurant and with Remy's family that can jeopardize the whole scheme. I have to say that the best character is Linguini, it's obvious that the animators had a blast animating him because it's so funny and all his mannerisms are executed spectacularly. Themes like family, friendship, passion and more are the core of the film and everything is enveloped in a beautiful score by the great Michael Giacchino. The animation is a sight to behold. Paris looks so beautifully breathtaking and the food looks so deliciously real that you will get real hungry while watching the film. Ratatouille is Pixar's 8th triumph and one they should be very proud about. A wonderful film.Video & Audio:Ratatouille comes to BD looking absolutely fantastic. This is hardly a surprise being a Pixar film but still the transfer mesmerize. Colors jump off the screen, detail and contrast are terrific and no compression artifacts whatsoever. Simply amazing.The 5.1 uncompressed audio is also amazing with fidelity and clarity beyond your expectations. Spectacular.Bonus Material:Ratatouille comes with a nice assortment of bonus features although is not as loaded as other Pixar films. First you have a documentary ""Fine food and Film"" which is a conversation with director Brad Bird and top chef Thomas Keller. It's a fantastic piece where you learn how they chose their careers and how passionate they are about it. You have two great shorts ""Lifted"" and ""Your Friend the Rat"". You also have making of featurettes that deals with all the aspects of the production of the film including story, characters, music, design and more.

1100280,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000VBJEEG,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 2]","The craftsmanship in a Pixar film is so startling that it's easy to take the genuine artistry behind it for granted given the studio's consistent run of hits sinceToy Storyover a dozen years ago. LikeThe IncrediblesandCars, this 2007 confection runs nearly two hours, comparatively long for an animated film, with a story that demands more attention than most. Unlike the animated films under Disney's banner, this one doesn't offer any musical numbers as story breaks. Director/co-screenwriter Brad Bird, who was also behind theThe Incredibles, returns with a charmer that is as much a sumptuous treat for the Food Network generation as it is a parable about self-fulfillment and tolerance. Except for a few set pieces, especially toward the end, the movie is not quite as exhilarating as previous efforts, but there is no getting around its sheer entertainment value.The dense plot focuses primarily on Remy, an intellectually curious rat with a heightened sense of smell. He lives in a rodent colony in the French countryside headed by his wizened father Django, who uses Remy to smell everyone's food for possible poison. However, Remy has bigger dreams of becoming a chef like Gusteau, the recently deceased guiding light behind Paris' finest restaurant. While escaping from an old crone whose kitchen he has been using, Remy fittingly ends up at Gusteau's where he meets a bumbling garbage boy named Linguini. By hiding under Linguini's chef hat and pulling on his scalp like a puppeteer, Remy is now able to fulfill his dream of becoming a world-class chef. Thanks to Remy's culinary wizardry, Linguini becomes the talk of the town. Naturally, Linguini has to take credit for Remy's dishes and attracts the attention of fellow sous-chef Colette who has dreams of becoming a chef herself. No fanciful story like this would be complete without a villain, and this time, it is Skinner, the small, self-centered sous-chef who took over the restaurant after Gusteau's death only to cheapen the master chef's name by developing a line of microwavable food products to mass market.The rest of the story plays itself out in inevitable fashion but with plenty of clever twists and turns thanks to the perceptive screenplay by Bird, Jan Pinkava and Jim Capobianco, which focuses on the human qualities in the rodents. Needless to say, the CGI work is impressive, especially when the rats literally take over the kitchen. However, the visual realism of seeing the rats swarm in multiple battalions is a bit daunting to watch no matter how human Bird tries to make them. Despite the appearance of marquee names, the vocal casting is for the most part, merely serviceable. Comedian Patton Oswalt brings the right level of enthusiastic optimism to Remy's voice, while Brad Garrett (Gusteau's spirit), Ian Holm (Skinner), Janeane Garofalo (Colette) and Will Arnett (fellow sous-chef Horst) lose much of their individual personalities to their thick French accents. Lou Romano lends a fumbling callowness to Linguini, while Brian Dennehy is certainly recognizable as Django. The true standout, however, is Peter O'Toole who voices intimidating food critic Anton Ego with his usual theatrical flair.I'm surprised the extras on the 2007 DVD are relatively sparse for a major Pixar release. There is no commentary track from Bird, but instead, a 14-minute featurette with him and master chef Thomas Keller, who opened his kitchen at the legendary French Laundry restaurant to the animation team. This isn't Keller's first foray into cinema since he helped prepare Adam Sandler for his role as a celebrity chef in the execrableSpanglish. The two best extras are the animation shorts.

1100284,AOTMP0OKJOUWI,B000VBJEEG,"Emily J. Morris ""Backroads""","[2, 2]","I remember the first time I ever saw a teaser for this movie. I thought it looked silly and I had to wonder just what Pixar and Disney were thinking. A rat wanting to get fancy Frency food. Please.But time went by, and cuter trailers appeared, and I found myself wanting to see the movie about the cute rat in the restaurant. So it came out and I had a free weekend.This is one of those movies where you spend the whole time thinking ""This is so good!"" while at the same time barely having enough time to think so as you are so caught up in the story and the stellar animation. It's subtle, heartfelt, and downright hilarious with a character-driven plot and so many themes I can't possibly count them all.Remy is a rat not altogether satisfied with his garbage-eating existence in the French countryside. He was born with an extreme sense of smell, which makes him useful to his colony when it comes to sniffing out rat poison--one of the many reasons his fellow rats despise humans. But Remy is fascinated by humans and their ability to create things, and eventually his interest leads him into the world of cooking when his nose becomes handy in blending flavors. A tragedy leads him to Paris, more specifically Gusteau's, the fallen-from-grace restaurant that had once belonged to the deceased chef Remy admired. Here he meets Linguini, an awkward young man who can't cook, and they figure they can help each other out.Do not be misled--this is far from being the only part of this incredible story. Rather there is a series of incidents created by a colorful cast of characters that leads us not only from movie's beginning to end but through some amazing character development and more plot events; it's infinitely better than contrived and forced plots that are so often shoved down our throats. This has many stories: the aforementioned, Remy's division between the worlds of rats and humans, an adorable love story between Linguini and a driven cook by the name of Collette, and that of Skinner, the new head chef determined to keep the restaurant under his own power. While we all love an intense character, ""Ratatouille"" keeps its players surprisingly realistic and subtle rather than making them into a circus of stereotypes. Admittedly, disbelief must be suspended in certain parts, but the story is so endearing and good that you are certainly willing to do so.The complexity of so many things is what make this film stand out. As Remy is torn between the worlds of humans and rats he is faced with the contradiction of what he is: a rat wanting to cook, but stealing food at the same time. Also there is the problem of Remy wanting credit, but neither wanting to lose his place in the world of gourmet. You must also notice the range between the fanciful talking rats and the realistic problems of wills and DNA testing. It works.I know I said I could not name the many themes circulating through this movie, but I must go at one. The title ""Ratatouille"" is not only a pun referring to the rodent characters, but is also a peasant dish never to be served at a fancy French restaurant. It's low, it's common, but as the movie shows can be more than any other food. This is a story about finding greatness in the ordinary.I feel this is one of Pixar's finest. It is a film that will stay with you long after it has finished.",5,Delicious DVD,1210464000,"05 11, 2008",2008,3337,"['remember', 'first', 'time', 'ever', 'saw', 'teaser', 'movie', 'thought', 'looked', 'silly', 'had', 'wonder', 'just', 'what', 'Pixar', 'Disney', 'were', 'thinking', 'rat', 'wanting', 'get', 'fancy', 'Frency', 'food', 'Please.But', 'time', 'went', 'cuter', 'trailers', 'appeared', 'found', 'wanting', 'see', 'movie', 'cute', 'rat', 'restaurant', 'came', 'out', 'had', 'free', 'weekend.This', 'one', 'movies', 'where', 'spend', 'whole', 'time', 'thinking', 'so', 'good', 'same', 'time', 'barely', 'having', 'enough', 'time', 'think', 'so', 'are', 'so', 'caught', 'up', 'story', 'stellar', 'animation', 'subtle', 'heartfelt', 'downright', 'hilarious', 'character-driven', 'plot', 'so', 'many', 'themes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'count', 'all.Remy', 'rat', 'not', 'altogether', 'satisfied', 'garbage-eating', 'existence', 'French', 'countryside', 'was', 'born', 'extreme', 'sense', 'smell', 'useful', 'colony', 'when', 'sniffing', 'out', 'rat', 'poison', 'one', 'many', 'reasons', 'fellow', 'rats', 'despise', 'humans', 'Remy', 'fascinated', 'humans', 'ability', 'create', 'things', 'eventually', 'interest', 'world', 'cooking', 'when', 'nose', 'handy', 'blending', 'flavors', 'tragedy', 'Paris', 'more', 'specifically', 'Gusteau', 'fallen-from-grace', 'restaurant', 'had', 'once', 'belonged', 'deceased', 'chef', 'Remy', 'admired', 'Here', 'Linguini', 'awkward', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'cook', 'figure', 'can', 'help', 'other', 'out.Do', 'not', 'be', 'misled', 'far', 'being', 'only', 'part', 'incredible', 'story', 'series', 'incidents', 'created', 'colorful', 'cast', 'characters', 'not', 'only', 'movie', 'beginning', 'end', 'amazing', 'character', 'development', 'more', 'plot', 'events', 'infinitely', 'better', 'contrived', 'forced', 'plots', 'are', 'so', 'often', 'shoved', 'down', 'throats', 'many', 'stories', 'aforementioned', 'Remy', 'division', 'worlds', 'rats', 'humans', 'adorable', 'love', 'story', 'Linguini', 'driven', 'cook', 'name', 'Collette', 'Skinner', 'new', 'head', 'chef', 'determined', 'keep', 'restaurant', 'own', 'power', 'love', 'intense', 'character', 'Ratatouille', 'players', 'surprisingly', 'realistic', 'rather', 'making', 'circus', 'stereotypes', 'Admittedly', 'disbelief', 'must', 'be', 'suspended', 'certain', 'parts', 'story', 'so', 'endearing', 'good', 'are', 'certainly', 'willing', 'do', 'so.The', 'complexity', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'what', 'make', 'film', 'stand', 'out', 'Remy', 'torn', 'worlds', 'humans', 'rats', 'faced', 'contradiction', 'what', 'rat', 'wanting', 'cook', 'stealing', 'food', 'same', 'time', 'Also', 'problem', 'Remy', 'wanting', 'credit', 'neither', 'wanting', 'lose', 'place', 'world', 'gourmet', 'must', 'also', 'notice', 'range', 'fanciful', 'talking', 'rats', 'realistic', 'problems', 'wills', 'DNA', 'testing', 'works.I', 'know', 'said', 'could', 'not', 'name', 'many', 'themes', 'circulating', 'movie', 'must', 'go', 'one', 'title', 'Ratatouille', 'not', 'only', 'pun', 'referring', 'rodent', 'characters', 'also', 'peasant', 'dish', 'never', 'be', 'served', 'fancy', 'French', 'restaurant', 'low', 'common', 'movie', 'shows', 'can', 'be', 'more', 'other', 'food', 'story', 'finding', 'greatness', 'ordinary.I', 'feel', 'one', 'Pixar', 'finest', 'film', 'will', 'stay', 'long', 'finished']",N/A
1100285,A5BOJX3CM4XV4,B000VBJEEG,"Emmit W. Stewart ""movie fan""","[1, 1]","A total fantasy, of course. Rats don't cook, and given a preference, they would eat all their food raw. But putting that aside, this movie does make a good point about prejudice.Much of what we think we know about rats is based upon stereotypes.  Rats are seen as dirty, vicious, disease carrying monsters.Actually, wild rats are only dirty because we(and our beloved cats) force them to hide in filthy places.Real rats are not vicious. they are timid and will avoid contact with us at every chance.  Only when they are trapped and in immediate danger of being killed will they defend themselves with the only weapon they have, their teeth. In any fight between a human and a rat that I have ever known there have only been two possible outcomes. first, and most often, the rat is killed, second, the rat evades the human and runs away at the first opportunity.In the case of disease, the fact is that the diseases that rats carry are just as lethal to the rats as they are to us.  In fact, squirrels carry the same diseases and we feed those little beggars thousands of dollars worth of  corn and peanuts every month and try to persuade them to come up and take the treats out of our bare hands.I have had friends who breed rats, and those that I have had a chance to handle were clean, friendly, and kind of cute. I do not keep them myself because of the work required to keep their cages cleaned. This is, I might mention, is the same amount required to keep a hamster or parrot cage clean.But, disregarding the dull world of facts, This movie is a delightful, rambling romp through an imaginary world where men can be  manipulated like puppets by pulling on their hair, people can be subdued or even killed using only one thumb, where pictures in books can come out and give deeply moving advice, rats can cook better than experienced chefs, and rats can be served in special dining rooms on the terrace of Parisian restaurants.This movie has something for everyone who can suspend their disbelief for a few hours.  Its Disney at its best and Pixar at its most ingenious.  Sit yourself down for a couple hours of fantastic, wonderful, and not so serious, fun.(By the way, I looked up the recipe for Ratatouille. Its a stew or casserole made from sliced eggplant, sliced zucchini,and sliced green peppers topped with parmesan cheese. The word itself means shake-and-stir, Ratata is french for shake and tatouille means stir.  Google the recipe and serve it to your family after the movie.)",5,Paris will never be the same,1196121600,"11 27, 2007",2007,2492,"['total', 'fantasy', 'course', 'Rats', 'do', ""n't"", 'cook', 'given', 'preference', 'would', 'eat', 'food', 'raw', 'putting', 'aside', 'movie', 'make', 'good', 'point', 'prejudice.Much', 'what', 'think', 'know', 'rats', 'based', 'stereotypes', 'Rats', 'are', 'seen', 'dirty', 'vicious', 'disease', 'carrying', 'monsters.Actually', 'wild', 'rats', 'are', 'only', 'dirty', 'beloved', 'cats', 'force', 'hide', 'filthy', 'places.Real', 'rats', 'are', 'not', 'vicious', 'are', 'timid', 'will', 'avoid', 'contact', 'chance', 'Only', 'when', 'are', 'trapped', 'immediate', 'danger', 'being', 'killed', 'will', 'defend', 'only', 'weapon', 'have', 'teeth', 'fight', 'human', 'rat', 'have', 'ever', 'known', 'there', 'have', 'only', 'been', 'two', 'possible', 'outcomes', 'first', 'most', 'often', 'rat', 'killed', 'second', 'rat', 'human', 'away', 'first', 'case', 'disease', 'fact', 'diseases', 'rats', 'carry', 'are', 'just', 'lethal', 'rats', 'are', 'fact', 'squirrels', 'carry', 'same', 'diseases', 'feed', 'little', 'beggars', 'thousands', 'dollars', 'corn', 'peanuts', 'month', 'try', 'persuade', 'come', 'up', 'take', 'treats', 'bare', 'hands.I', 'have', 'had', 'friends', 'who', 'breed', 'rats', 'have', 'had', 'chance', 'handle', 'were', 'clean', 'friendly', 'kind', 'cute', 'do', 'not', 'keep', 'work', 'required', 'keep', 'cages', 'cleaned', 'might', 'mention', 'same', 'amount', 'required', 'keep', 'hamster', 'parrot', 'cage', 'clean.But', 'disregarding', 'dull', 'world', 'facts', 'movie', 'delightful', 'rambling', 'romp', 'imaginary', 'world', 'where', 'men', 'can', 'be', 'manipulated', 'puppets', 'pulling', 'hair', 'people', 'can', 'be', 'subdued', 'even', 'killed', 'using', 'only', 'one', 'thumb', 'where', 'pictures', 'books', 'can', 'come', 'out', 'give', 'deeply', 'moving', 'advice', 'rats', 'can', 'cook', 'better', 'experienced', 'chefs', 'rats', 'can', 'be', 'served', 'special', 'dining', 'rooms', 'terrace', 'Parisian', 'restaurants.This', 'movie', 'something', 'everyone', 'who', 'can', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'few', 'hours', 'Disney', 'best', 'Pixar', 'most', 'ingenious', 'Sit', 'down', 'couple', 'hours', 'fantastic', 'wonderful', 'not', 'so', 'serious', 'fun', 'way', 'looked', 'up', 'recipe', 'Ratatouille', 'stew', 'casserole', 'made', 'sliced', 'eggplant', 'sliced', 'zucchini', 'sliced', 'green', 'peppers', 'topped', 'parmesan', 'cheese', 'word', 'shake-and-stir', 'Ratata', 'french', 'shake', 'tatouille', 'means', 'stir', 'Google', 'recipe', 'serve', 'family', 'movie']",N/A

Villasor ""tedi31""","[4, 6]","Pixar has certainly outdone themselves with the animated feature Ratatouille; the story of a young rat named Remy who pairs up with the imbecile (but well meaning) Linguini to form one of the greatest culinary talents Paris has ever seen.Much has been said of the ""if you put your mind to it"" angle as well as the staple stereotypes (e.g., ""don't go near humans,"" etc.). But what really struck me was what the critique, Anton Ego (voiced by legendary actor Peter O'Toole) said as he was pondering what to write in his food column.""In many ways, the work of a critic is easy. We risk very little yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment. We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read. But the bitter truth we critics must face is that, in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk is more meaningful than our criticism designating it so. But there are times when a critic truly risks something, and that is in the discovery and defense of the new. Last night, I experienced something new, an extraordinary meal from a singularly unexpected source. To say that both the meal and its maker have challenged my preconceptions is a gross understatement. They have rocked me to my core. In the past, I have made no secret of my disdain for Chef Gusteau's famous motto: Anyone can cook. But I realize that only now do I truly understand what he meant. Not everyone can become a great artist, but a great artist can come from anywhere. It is difficult to imagine more humble origins than those of the genius now cooking at Gusteau's, who is, in this critic's opinion, nothing less than the finest chef in France. I will be returning to Gusteau's soon, hungry for more.""Critics in most circles usually have the necessary machinery to get their message across and as Anton Ego pointed out, they -""thrive on negative criticism"" - as this is what causes controversy; a demand; and in most cases, even a need. But Ego also makes his readers (or in the case of the movie, listeners) realize is that despite what any one critic or person says, the most important opinion is that of your own.Well, that's what I got out of it.

The idea seemed too original and brave for my taste. As film had been shown all over the world, I kept reading and hearing only great reviews for it. Then, my brother who usually does not get exited about any movie, told me that ""Ratatouille"" was absolutely charming, captivating, funny and moving at the same time, and the most charming about it was Remy, a rat, ""little chef"" with huge talent in the fine art of cooking. I saw the movie last weekend and I am happy to agree with my brother completely. ""Ratatouille"" has everything for every viewer to enjoy - technical excellence, amazing colors, highly original images, and the voices that matched the characters perfectly. The film is a clever satire and the moving story that will be interesting for the adults and children alike. Where the movie succeeds admirably - in showing on the screen the process of cooking which can be as inspiring and creative as painting, writing, or composing the music: ""How can I describe it? Good food is like music you can taste, color you can smell. There is excellence all around you. You need only to be aware to stop and savor it."" Speaking of how the movies sometimes affect our life - after we saw ""Ratatouille"" together with my husband, he demanded that I cooked him a Ratatouille that would take him back to his happy childhood days and rock him to his core just like the one that Remy prepared for a ""grim eater"", the universally feared food critic Anton Ego.Not every year, an animated film is nominated for five Academy awards, and I wish ""Ratatouille"" victories in every category.

I hate that shiny, garish look that the lesser films -- and even some of the major films -- have had. And while I love photo-realism when it's used for live-action effects, it seems pointless in animation. I spend my life in reality. When I watch a cartoon I want to be transported to a different environment, one I''ve never seen in real life like Snow White's forest or the Beast's castle. For a long while, all CGI animated movies looked alike. I missed the wonderful painterly backgrounds (Okay. I'm an artist myself, so I'm biased.) While I've certainly enjoyed all of Pixar's films, they didn't really inspire me. But now the technology has expanded enough so that filmmakers can do almost anything. ""Ratatouille"" is a marvel! Visually, it looks like art. While the lighting is photo-realistic, everything else is wonderfully stylized and painterly. Of course, this would be simply a nice technological breakthrough if it weren't paired with such a warm, witty script and superb animation and direction. ""Ratatouille"" succeeds on every level. Even the music is wonderful. On the one hand it's as sophisticated as a Billy Wilder comedy; yet, I saw it with an audience of toddlers and they seemed transfixed.

Everyone loves Ratatouille...even though he is a rat in the kitchen.Indeed, the idea of rats in an upscale restaurant would normally have us run for cover. Nevertheless, the movie successfully blends the themes of the Ugly Duckling with Cyrano de Bergerac to come up with a fantastic story.  Remy is a simple rat with an extraordinary nose.  His idol is a great French chef who lectures on the Food Channel. ""Anyone Can Cook"" is his mantra.  So when Remy and his rat family have to leave their homes, Remy accidentally ends up in the very kitchen of this great Chef.  Alas, the great chef has passed away, and the food standards are falling, as well as the Michelin stars.  To reverse this trend, Remy - the rat - teams up with a clueless scullery boy in the kitchen to whip up some wonderful recipes. Indeed, the rat's food creations are a hit with the customers. The problem, as in all Cyrano stories, is that no one knows who is really behind those wonderful recipes. And most important, will  the most difficult restaurant critic in Paris condemn or praise the food that Remy prepares?Everything about this film is wonderful...the streets of Paris are recreated in rich colors and exquisite detail.  I haven't seen a European city look this good in an animated film since Disney's ""Pinocchio."" Yes, it is definitely worth experiencing this delight on Blu-Ray. Oh my, even the French copper pots look authentic.The most wonderful moment of the film is the food review given by Anton Ego - one of the ""big"" restaurant critics of France - of the menu prepared by the rat chefs.  And what is so memorable is how ""poetic"" his review is. This is a testament to the excellent care to the script writing by the Pixar team.On another point, I laughed hysterically throughout the film...particularly the times when the rat conceals himself in a chef hat and rides the garbage boy like a cowboy on a bronco.

Could this be Pixar's allusion to the proliferation of Disney animated sequels that John Lassiter curtailed?And was the diminutive Skinner character inspired at all by a certain former Disney executive nicknamed ""Sparky?"" (After all, the king in the first Shrek film was rumored to be a caricature of a certain Bazooka Joe-touting executive).Anyway, the film is a feast, even if the extras do not include a commentary track. Included are the shorts ""Lifted"" (which accompanied the feature in theaters) and the wondrously inventive new ""Your Friend the Rat,"" sporting that great Mary Blair/Ward Kimball look that designer Nate Wragg brought to many a Pixar title sequence and story book tie-in.Also of note is another fine musical score from Mark Giacchino, somewhat of a departure from his Bond-like score for The Incredibles, and yet seemingly a nod to Henry Mancini, who mixed action and whimsy, often including little themes for specific sequences (most notably in the scene in which Remy and Linguine practice their ""head control"").There's just no question that this is one to watch over and over (like revisiting a favorite recipe), which is one of the reasons it's great to have on DVD.",4,"A satisfying meal, though there's no commentary for dessert",1195689600,"11 22, 2007",2007,1571,"['not', 'much', 'more', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'can', 'add', 'almost', 'unanimous', 'praise', 'heaped', 'Disney*Pixar', 'Ratatouille', 'so', 'reviewing', 'DVD', 'perhaps', 'can', 'find', 'few', 'things', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'mentioned', 'often.I', 'am', 'not', 'only', 'person', ""'m"", 'sure', 'who', 'villain', 'attempts', 'cheapen', 'great', 'chef', 'Gusteau', 'name', 'mass-produced', 'convenience', 'foods', 'Could', 'be', 'Pixar', 'allusion', 'proliferation', 'Disney', 'animated', 'sequels', 'John', 'Lassiter', 'curtailed', 'was', 'diminutive', 'Skinner', 'character', 'inspired', 'certain', 'former', 'Disney', 'executive', 'nicknamed', 'Sparky', 'king', 'first', 'Shrek', 'film', 'was', 'rumored', 'be', 'caricature', 'certain', 'Bazooka', 'Joe-touting', 'executive', '.Anyway', 'film', 'feast', 'even', 'extras', 'do', 'not', 'include', 'commentary', 'track', 'Included', 'are', 'shorts', 'Lifted', 'accompanied', 'feature', 'theaters', 'wondrously', 'inventive', 'new', 'Friend', 'Rat', 'sporting', 'great', 'Mary', 'Blair/Ward', 'Kimball', 'look', 'designer', 'Nate', 'Wragg', 'brought', 'many', 'Pixar', 'title', 'sequence', 'story', 'book', 'tie-in.Also', 'note', 'fine', 'musical', 'score', 'Mark', 'Giacchino', 'somewhat', 'departure', 'Bond-like', 'score', 'Incredibles', 'yet', 'seemingly', 'nod', 'Henry', 'Mancini', 'who', 'mixed', 'action', 'whimsy', 'often', 'including', 'little', 'themes', 'specific', 'sequences', 'most', 'notably', 'scene', 'Remy', 'Linguine', 'practice', 'head', 'control', 'just', 'question', 'one', 'watch', 'revisiting', 'favorite', 'recipe', 'one', 'reasons', 'great', 'have', 'DVD']",N/A

1100314,A2UYAFQ40U2PHS,B000VBJEEG,"Grigory's Girl ""GR""","[3, 3]","I think this film is a tad overrated, but it's negatives are with the story and dialogue primarily.  I still enjoyed the film very much.  I've always liked most of what Pixar has done (which may surprise some of my friends here), and this film is a good addition to their catalogue.  There were a few problems, though.  I felt there was too much expository information, especially at the beginning.  Much of the dialogue (and situations) were very predictable, including the usual ""the French are rude"" stuff.  I didn't buy the romance between Colette and Linguini.  It felt forced, and didn't seem like it would really happen, in movie life or in real life.  The repartee between the rats seemed forced, too.On the good side, the film is visually immaculate.  Brad Bird does a tremendous job here, and he has a great sense of composition.  I wish I had seen it in a theater.  The animation is positively gorgeous.  The voices are very well done for the most part, and my favorite characters are Peter O'Toole's Anton Ego (great name) the critic, and Gusteau, voiced by Brad Garrett.  Many made hay of Janeane Garofalo's French accent for Colette, but I feel Garrett's is much, much better.  Garofalo's accent, while good, had a few dropouts here and there where her real voice came through.  This is not entirely her fault, as they changed her character to one with a French accent late in the production, and she did the best she could on such short notice.  Many were surprised that Garofalo managed to do an accent pretty well.  I'm not.  I've always believed in her talent.  Patton Oswalt (best known for his recurring role in The King of Queens, and one of the funnier standup comedians today) is fine as Remy, the rat who can cook.  The film has a real nice wrap up too, incorporating Gusteau's phrase that ""anyone can cook"", and Peter O'Toole's final speech in the film is surprisingly moving and stirring.

I had to help myself get past the absurdity of a dirty rat that can control the movements of a person by yanking on his hair in order to cook meals to enjoy this film. Once I did, I truly opened the door to a marvelous masterpiece. The film has it's moments of comedy, but the story is really touching. Combining these elements with a wonderful score and marvelous performances makes this my favorite movie of the year.I really hate writing reviews, because I don't want to give too much about the film away. I really knew very little about this movie before I saw it, and I think that helped make it so enjoyable for me when I finally got to see it. One of my most favorite parts of the film is when ""The Grim Eater"" writes his review of Gusteau's restaurant near the end of the film. The words are so well organized and seem to just flow in wonderfully succinct passion that I find myself aspiring to elevate my own linguistic skills.I give this DVD 4 stars because of the actual DVD itself. There is no 2-disc version of this film available on DVD that I have been able to find. Whether such a version will be available in the future is unknown. There are only a couple of bonus features. One is the short film ""Lifted"" and another is a little presenation on the history of rats. This is really a shame, because I find it rare to desire such a release of most films.

A real legend these fleas of Paris Hotels. Ask Ms Paris Hilton: she will tell you everything about it and she can compare with the fleas of American prisons. But Walt Disney has decided to go a lot further in its debunking of Paris, to teach those damned urban frogs a good lesson since they don't seem to have understood that they had to make themselves very, very small after their being rejected for the 2012 Olympic Games. And the lesson is as hot as hell. All best restaurants in Paris have hired, as chefs in their kitchens, the ugliest and least hygienic people they could find, I mean the gutter and sewage rats, and there again Paris has a record: not so much as for the quality of their rats but as for the number of them. It is even murmured that unemployment has gone suddenly down in Paris because of this hiring policy of Paris hotels since all unemployed people in Paris, particularly in the ethnic northern and eastern suburbs, are nothing but rats basking in the moonshine. That will show how low these Frenchies of Paris have gone: their haute cuisine is done and produced by rats. You can be rest assured that in the next Walt Disney film they will show that French haute couture is in the hand of a bunch of pigs and French perfumes in the hands, or shouldn't I say in the sweaty shoes, of bedbugs, or who knows what other stinking beetle or skunk. The kids though love it and there is some humor here and there, and I must say the Parisians deserve it quite a lot because they are always obnoxious with foreigners, strangers and tourists. All serious study proves it with hard data. So they just get the change their fake forged bank notes deserve. But there are some myths that like going around in the world. Ratatouille has nothing to do with Paris since it is a dish prepared in Marseilles, originally, at least as far I know, though some dictionaries tell me it is from Nice. Same mistake. At least they do not bring up the most popular and famous dish of France in France today, i.e. couscous, that is prepared, it is well known in France, by some special species of rats, but this would have been racist. At least one thing will be sure: French fries will no longer be what they used to be. I bet they can be called fried rat's nests and enter the legend that in Haute Cuisine they don't have cockroaches, but they have coq au vin, and no one knows what's the connection between the two, nor which one is better than the other. At least in Paris you can't make the difference.

The first was the director, Brad Bird, who wrote, directed, voiced, and probably did make-up for ""The Incredibles""... what I believe is one of the greatest animations of all time.  What clenched it for me was a review by somebody who's opinion I trust.First, we were treated by the usual Pixar short animation before the movie.  Oh, how I love these.  They are cute, short, hilarious, and often unpredictable.  The one preceding this movie was no exception.We were then treated to the movie.You first get to know Remy (the rat that everybody sees in the advertising) and his family.  He isn't happy with his life because he does not get to do the one thing that he wants to do the most... cook.  But when his rat colony needs to move suddenly he loses contact with his loved ones but finds himself in Paris and meets Linguini, an employee at a restaurant who couldn't properly make a batch of ice if requested.  The problem with being a rat is that you aren't openly welcomed in anybody's kitchen.  However, after a series of interesting events, Remy and Linguini team up to become the cooking sensation of Paris.Hilarity ensues.The story is good and it works.  I like the message, which is basically to not judge a book by its cover.  The characters grow and we end up really interested on how everybody turns out.  Like other Pixar movies, it had everything you could wish for in a movie.  If you like other Pixar movies, there is little reason to not pick this movie up.So why only four stars?  Three reasons.The first is my OCD rearing its head.... there was a freaking RAT in the KITCHEN touching all the FOOD!!!  Sorry, I just could not get over that.  I'd probably be more accepting of a cat, dog, or otter... but a rat?  One of the most diseased animals ever?  Did the writers ever hear of a little event knows as the GREAT PLAGUE??!?!  But, that is just me.  I know, I know... he washes his hands, but still.The second is the mechanism that Remy and Linguini come up with so they could cook together.  This was more unbelievable than talking and cooking mice.  I guess it would have been more difficult to come up with something else but with Brad Bird's genius I think he just came up with something easy instead of clever.Lastly, this was in Paris.

1100332,A331WJPUGHRWIH,B000VBJEEG,James Mace,"[3, 3]","Proving that good things come to those who wait, Ratatouille serves up a rich, funny, enjoyable, and most importantly, ORIGINAL story. The strength of Pixar lies not in its animation (which is revolutionary and sets the standard by which others are judged), but rather in its writers. The best animation is hollow without a strong story to place it in, and this is where Pixar excels.Instead of regurgitating stuff we've already already heard, they give us original, and sometimes off-the-wall, stories. I mean seriously, who would have dreamed up a story about a rat who aspires to be a Parisian chef?? This is supplemented by Pixar's ever superior graphics and animation. Like all of their films, the animators did a lot of in depth studying to see exactly what Parisian cuisine was supposed to look like.Like their previous films, Ratatouille appeals to both families with young children, as well as single adults. This balance is one of the film's biggest strong points. If I have any complaints, it would be the lack of lines by John Ratzenberger, who has been in every Pixar film to date and whose voice always stands out (this is even a running joke at the end of ""Cars""). Ratzenberger is in Ratatouille as Mustafa the waiter; however he speaks in a faux-French accent and has hardly any lines at all.

But the humor and the funny talking rats pull my kids right in, and my husband and I really like this movie as well. The story follows a rat named Remy with the unlikely dream of being a chef. Rats in the kitchen is pretty much always a bad thing, so Remy has some work to do to make his dream a reality.

The action in the film is fast-paced and the animation is fabulous, so it's a treat for the eyes.

Don't we all have a dream? I have no problem with rats as heros or determined heroic icons, having loved a mouse (Stuart Little, of course!) all my life, and numerous other animal stars. Obviously, viewers of this film must understand and accept what they are getting into when they watch ""Ratatouille"". Remy the rat is as adorable and as dedicated to his love of gourmet cooking as he can be. Linguini beomes his partner. This inept, Cinderella-like garbage boy of the kitchen in the fine French restaurant which keeps losing its stars and lustre is a great character, very human, bumbling, and loaded with appeal. Not as sweet, but totally charming is Colette, the attractive chef who is ""stuck"" with Linguini after he cooks up a soup all the diners discover and rave over. It has actually been cooked up by the incredibly talented rat-chef Remy, who had laboriously and secretively climbed up ladles, using them as springboards to drop bits of flavorings into the pot until his creation was perfection! Truly, all he has ever wanted to do all his life is cook! Remy believes with all his soul in a cookook author, now dead, who has written a book Remy read called Anyone Can Cook. That very same author is now a little bitty portly angel floating around on Remy's shoulder, talking to him and giving him supportive advice. Interestingly, Remy himself is on Linguini's actual HEAD, beneath Linguini's chef's hat, or ""toque"",  guiding him and giving HIM advice. He does this by directing him -- pulling his hair to the right, or the left, making him go toward one food item or another.Of course we're going to have some bad guys...we have a head chef who is a dirty rotten scoundrel, and we have a food critic (voice played by Peter O'Toole) who just generally hates the whole world, we know not why. We have a health department inspector who certainly doesn't love rats, and so on.How the food critic (most importantly) is won over by our motley little crew, at the end of the movie, is quite touching, and I had a tear in my eye.For the most part, however, instead I was laughing steadily throughout this enjoyable movie, which I recommend for family viewing. I don't really think your youngest chidren will go for it, but give them a chance.

""A New Yorker""","[3, 5]","If you love quality films and think Pixar is leading the industry in innovation and storytelling, you owe it to yourself to see ""Ratatouille."" Pixar will only maintain creative control over its product so long as they are earning money for Disney. Unlike its predecessors Cars, The Incredibles, Finding Nemo, and Monsters, Inc., Ratatouille failed to earn even $50 million in its opening weekend. A lot of money, yes, but not a good sign for the investors.Money aside, Pixar has proved once again that they can do what no one else can: create fully realized CG worlds that are only secondary to the story being told. The CG here is simply marvelous. Paris comes to life, the food is so realistic you want to reach out and eat it, and the rats move with a delicate grace that is at the same time cartoonish and believable. But what truly sets Pixar apart from every other animation studio is that they can walk that line between animated reality and cartoon absurdity. The key, here, is the people that inhabit the worlds they've created. They don't look remotely realistic. They look, in fact, much like the humans in The Incredibles. Overlarge heads, exaggerated limbs, and a fluidity of movement that can only be recreated in a movie. Unlike Shrek, or Ice Age, or any other CG movie, Ratatouille allows it's humans be to be cartoons, but they surround them with the most realistic world imaginable. This effect isn't disconcerting, it frees the viewer to sit back and simply absorb everything.Like their previous efforts, the story is everything. Remy is a rat who loves to cook and he befriends a young man who can't cook, but works in the kitchen of a famous restaurant. The story is both hilarious and exciting. It never falls into melodramatic traps, and the characters act in believable ways - they don't simply do what the writers think they should do to advance the plot to a happy conclusion.In short, this is not a formulaic film. It balances ingenuity, wit, and skill, and produces one of the finest films in it's category. I don't know if this is the best Pixar film yet, but it's at least the equal of Finding Nemo, Monsters, Inc, Toy Story, and The Incredibles. In fifty years, we'll all be looking back on Pixar as the finest example of a creative force in Hollywood. Let's hope Disney allows them to continue making films their way.At the end of the day, the family and I have no problem with ""Ratatouille"".

It makes the ridiculously popular Shrek look, well, green.Bonus features are entertaining, particularly the well-concieved short on the history of Rats.

The short LIFTED also appears on this disc as well as the just released PIXAR SHORTS DVD/Blu-ray.While it lacks the high adventure and fan-boy characters of some of Pixar's earlier works, Rataouille will be regarded with more and more acclaim as time goes by.  Critic's rightfully praised the film in it's theatrical release but American audiences didn't take to it as eagerly as past films.

I didn't think it could get more charming and fun than that but Ratatouille proved me wrong. It's about a rat who has a scent for what's good food and what's bad food. His father just wants him to use that gift to make sure the clang aren't eating poisoned food. When the clang has to relocate he loses them but he can live with that since he find's his favorite late chef's restuarant. The restuarant isn't the same without the chef but the rat's taste for what makes good food could be enough to turn it back into a 5 Star Restuarant. Only an untalented new chef knows that it's actually the rat who's the talented new chef.The result is a charming appretising film that has the style of an old fashioned Disney movie. It has as good of a story as the traditional animated Disney films that they don't make anymore. Plus it has of a good of a lesson as the older films do as well. Although I also like the ""keep moving forward"" lesson that we get from Meet the Robinsons. This movie is about following your dreams without letting anything get in the way.

Despite my understanding the magic of animation and being that I did indeed have an unwelcome rat in my kitchen a couple years ago, the notion of rats running through the food, let alone cooking, nauseates me beyond any level of comfort and I found myself cringing throughout ""Ratatouille.""

Goode ""JBG""","[0, 0]","The thing about Pixar movies isn't that they are good animated movies, but that they're very well written and directed movies as well. I look at them as great movies, which happen to be computer animated.I won't summarize the story here as that has already been done by other reviewers, so let me get to the grist of the matter.What is great about this movie?  Like all great movies, in the end it's about the characters. You might like a great story without so-so characters, but you'll love a so-so story with great characters.The servant-who-is-really-the-heir is not a new plot device, so nothing extraordinary there, but that's not to say the script didn't have it's great moments. The cracking ceiling, the lovers' quarrel, the health inspector, the Remy action sequence in the kitchen were all great little pieces but the characters really made it shine. And in the list of stand out characters I have to include the old lady, Colette, Skinner, the lawyer, the health inspector and most of all Anton Ego. I didn't find Alfredo particularly likeable, even though his human foibles are after all human, and I didn't find Remy to be particularly stand out either. Rather, I found the bit parts to be more memorable.It's Colette who is the strong one and the likeable one here, and even Anton, once you know he's going to be ""turned"". And so, it's not the two main protagonists that evoke the most emotions which is...... something new and different and we all know what people feel about new and different, LOL.The great artistic sequence was of course the taste of the ratatouille which bought Anton back to his childhood and back, and the pen dropping out of his fingers. Outstanding, just truly one of the best scenes I've seen in years. And the ""Let's cook!"" exhortation by Colette, that just summed her up to a T, brillant!So in ending, what made this a great movie? The animation, the script's memorable sequences, the characters, and really most of all, what really counts, it brought out the emotions in me. It made me laugh, it made me cry, and it gave me a good feeling in the pit of my stomach. $20 is a mere pittance for that.",5,Excellent!,1195344000,"11 18, 2007",2007,2142,"['thing', 'Pixar', 'movies', ""n't"", 'are', 'good', 'animated', 'movies', ""'re"", 'very', 'well', 'written', 'directed', 'movies', 'well', 'look', 'great', 'movies', 'happen', 'be', 'computer', 'animated.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'summarize', 'story', 'here', 'already', 'been', 'done', 'other', 'reviewers', 'so', 'let', 'get', 'grist', 'matter.What', 'great', 'movie', 'great', 'movies', 'end', 'characters', 'might', 'like', 'great', 'story', 'so-so', 'characters', ""'ll"", 'love', 'so-so', 'story', 'great', 'characters.The', 'servant-who-is-really-the-heir', 'not', 'new', 'plot', 'device', 'nothing', 'extraordinary', 'there', 'not', 'say', 'script', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'great', 'moments', 'cracking', 'ceiling', 'lovers', 'quarrel', 'health', 'inspector', 'Remy', 'action', 'sequence', 'kitchen', 'were', 'great', 'little', 'pieces', 'characters', 'really', 'made', 'shine', 'list', 'stand', 'characters', 'have', 'include', 'old', 'lady', 'Colette', 'Skinner', 'lawyer', 'health', 'inspector', 'most', 'Anton', 'Ego', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'Alfredo', 'particularly', 'likeable', 'even', 'human', 'foibles', 'are', 'human', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'Remy', 'be', 'particularly', 'stand', 'out', 'Rather', 'found', 'bit', 'parts', 'be', 'more', 'memorable.It', 'Colette', 'who', 'strong', 'one', 'likeable', 'one', 'here', 'even', 'Anton', 'once', 'know', 'going', 'be', 'turned', 'so', 'not', 'two', 'main', 'protagonists', 'evoke', 'most', 'emotions', 'something', 'new', 'different', 'know', 'what', 'people', 'feel', 'new', 'different', 'LOL.The', 'great', 'artistic', 'sequence', 'was', 'course', 'taste', 'ratatouille', 'bought', 'Anton', 'back', 'childhood', 'back', 'pen', 'dropping', 'fingers', 'Outstanding', 'just', 'truly', 'one', 'best', 'scenes', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'years', 'Let', 'cook', 'exhortation', 'Colette', 'just', 'summed', 'up', 'T', 'brillant', 'So', 'ending', 'what', 'made', 'great', 'movie', 'animation', 'script', 'memorable', 'sequences', 'characters', 'really', 'most', 'what', 'really', 'brought', 'out', 'emotions', 'made', 'made', 'cry', 'gave', 'good', 'feeling', 'pit', 'stomach', '20', 'mere', 'pittance']",N/A

It is a hilarous, heart-warming comedy about life, love and friendship which will leave both a warm glow in your heart and stomach long after you leave the movie theater. Pixar Studios has wrought in vivid animation, a wonderful valentine to Paris and to the art of fine cuisine, using state-of-the-art techniques that provide this exquisite animated film a grand sense of realism which I've found lacking in many of the recent cinematic summer blockbusters of 2007; if there is one film from this season that will be remembered as an enduring cinematic classic, then I strongly suspect that film will be ""Ratatouille"".""Ratatouille"" is more than an intriguing Gallic twist on the time-worn tale of the country bumpkin who arrives in the big city, and unexpectedly, becomes someone recognized for his superb artistic craft. It's a hilarious look at friendship and personal relationships seen largely through the eyes of the French rat Remy (well-voiced by Patton Oswalt in a truly significant performance) who transforms both his excellent sense of smell and devotion to the culinary art of the late great French chef Gusteau (who also becomes quite literally, Remy's personal muse in brief appearances which resemble either Obi-Wan Kenobi's or Michael Behe's ""Intelligent Designer""; I'm more inclined to think of Gusteau as a culinary version of Kenobi.), becoming the ""Little Chef"" of the befuddled young garbage boy Linguini (Lou Romano), the newest employee of Gusteau's once posh Parisian restaurant, now under the strict thumb of the meglomanic head chef Skinner (Ian Holm). A dazzling set of spectacular adventures await both Linguini and his rodent friend Remy, culminating in a final culinary showdown with Skinner and Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole), Paris' legendary restaurant critic, set largely in some of the most authentic-looking depictions of a restaurant's kitchen that I have seen either in animation or live action.

What's impressive is that considering it's basically about a rat romping around a French gourmet restaurant's kitchen, it in no way skips acknowledging that rats are scavengers on humanity but in some way it makes that a plus for the movie (it doesn't hurt that the head of the rat colony has the voice of authority in Brian Dennehy).  How the hell Pixar manages to make a rat appealing is beyond me, but they do it here (and Patton Oswalt's voice performance certainly helps as well).  Definitely worth watching, especially for a subplot involving a top food critic that actually brought a tear to my eye in it's moment of truth.",5,Even In The Dirtiest Of Species,1218326400,"08 10, 2008",2008,936,"['kind', 'hard', 'describe', 'why', 'loved', 'movie', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'find', 'appreciated', 'Pixar', 'Brad', 'Bird', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'considering', 'one', 'more', 'disgusting', 'vile', 'creatures', 'planet', 'was', 'surprised', 'just', 'how', 'enjoyable', 'touching', 'movie', 'What', 'impressive', 'considering', 'basically', 'rat', 'romping', 'French', 'gourmet', 'restaurant', 'kitchen', 'way', 'acknowledging', 'rats', 'are', 'scavengers', 'humanity', 'way', 'plus', 'movie', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'head', 'rat', 'colony', 'voice', 'authority', 'Brian', 'Dennehy', 'How', 'hell', 'Pixar', 'make', 'rat', 'appealing', 'do', 'here', 'Patton', 'Oswalt', 'voice', 'performance', 'certainly', 'as', 'well', 'Definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'especially', 'subplot', 'involving', 'top', 'food', 'critic', 'actually', 'brought', 'tear', 'eye', 'moment', 'truth']",N/A

This film is somewhere in the middle of Pixar's output.  It is not the best but not the worst.Our rat is unusual.  He does not like the standard rat diet of garbage.  He has a refined palette which his family exploits to check for poison.  But he is unhappy.  A violent episode lands him in Paris where he finds the restaurant of his chef hero.  Here he has adventures with avoiding the staff and trying to cook.  Add two villains (yes, two), the restaurant's current owner and a food critic and our rat's life gets very complicated.This is a long film with much of it taken up by chase scenes.  The cooking scenes are fun and clever.  But in the middle we have the lone rat who does not fit in with other rats or with people as he keeps trying to be what he is not in order to please others.  It is only in the end when he finds a way to be true to himself that things begin to go well.  Great message but a little out there for the kids.

Silly, sophisticated, full of surprises and a joy to watch, ""Ratatouille"" is not only the best animated movie of 2007, it's also the year's best family film.The character animation is Pixar's best ever. The lead character, a rat named Remy, has the most expressive hand gestures, shrugs and other body language I've seen in a cartoon creature. The compositions, like the ground-level shots of Remy scurrying on a kitchen floor, or the overhead shot of a food critic's office, are simply inspired. And the film's details, especially in the kitchen scenes, make it great to watch on a large-screen TV.As for the story, after watching a celebrity chef on television, Remy the rat, a rodent blessed with an exquisite sense of smell and taste, dreams of becoming one himself. And soon he does, after he is accidentally swept into a storm drain, washes up near the most famous restaurant in France, and comes up with a delicious soup recipe. Teaming up with Linguini, a lowly dish boy, Remy fulfills his dream, in a funny, moving tale about fulfilling your potential against all odds.The best scene? When Linguini has to reproduce Remy's soup himself, the rat helps him out by hiding in the boy's chef hat, steering Linguini around a kitchen by yanking on his hair like a puppeteer. It's physical comedy at its best.Bonus features on this disc include:* The Pixar short that appeared with the film in theaters, ""Lifted,"" in which a novice alien pilot tries to abduct a sleeping human.* Some deleted scenes, with introductions by screenwriter and director Brad Bird.* A second animated short, ""Your Friend the Rat,"" starring Remy and his brother, Emile.* ""Fine Food and Film: A Conversation with Brad Bird and Thomas Keller,"" a featurette with the California celebrity chef who served as a consultant to the film.",5,One of the best family DVDs of the year,1188691200,"09 2, 2007",2007,1915,"[""'re"", 'looking', 'new', 'DVD', 'kids', 'can', 'enjoy', 'equally', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'better', 'one', 'Silly', 'sophisticated', 'full', 'surprises', 'joy', 'watch', 'Ratatouille', 'not', 'only', 'best', 'animated', 'movie', '2007', 'also', 'year', 'best', 'family', 'film.The', 'character', 'animation', 'Pixar', 'best', 'ever', 'lead', 'character', 'rat', 'named', 'Remy', 'most', 'expressive', 'hand', 'gestures', 'shrugs', 'other', 'body', 'language', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'cartoon', 'creature', 'compositions', 'ground-level', 'shots', 'Remy', 'scurrying', 'kitchen', 'floor', 'overhead', 'shot', 'food', 'critic', 'office', 'are', 'simply', 'inspired', 'film', 'details', 'especially', 'kitchen', 'scenes', 'make', 'great', 'watch', 'large-screen', 'TV.As', 'story', 'watching', 'celebrity', 'chef', 'television', 'Remy', 'rat', 'rodent', 'blessed', 'exquisite', 'sense', 'smell', 'taste', 'dreams', 'becoming', 'one', 'soon', 'accidentally', 'swept', 'storm', 'drain', 'up', 'most', 'famous', 'restaurant', 'France', 'up', 'delicious', 'soup', 'recipe', 'Teaming', 'up', 'Linguini', 'lowly', 'dish', 'boy', 'Remy', 'dream', 'funny', 'moving', 'tale', 'fulfilling', 'potential', 'odds.The', 'best', 'scene', 'When', 'Linguini', 'reproduce', 'Remy', 'soup', 'rat', 'out', 'hiding', 'boy', 'chef', 'hat', 'steering', 'Linguini', 'kitchen', 'yanking', 'hair', 'puppeteer', 'physical', 'comedy', 'best.Bonus', 'features', 'disc', 'include', '*', 'Pixar', 'short', 'appeared', 'film', 'theaters', 'Lifted', 'novice', 'alien', 'pilot', 'tries', 'abduct', 'sleeping', 'human', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'introductions', 'screenwriter', 'director', 'Brad', 'Bird', '*', 'second', 'animated', 'short', 'Friend', 'Rat', 'starring', 'Remy', 'brother', 'Emile', '*', 'Fine', 'Food', 'Film', 'Conversation', 'Brad', 'Bird', 'Thomas', 'Keller', 'featurette', 'California', 'celebrity', 'chef', 'who', 'served', 'consultant', 'film']",N/A

I like Brad Bird and have certainly enjoyed Pixar's offerings before. I checked the rating to make sure I could watch it with my 5 year old niece and was pleased to see it was G. We popped it in the player and sat down to watch. Well, when you're watching a movie with a 5 year old, you tend to see things from that 5 year old's perspective. And I have to say this movie should have been rated PG. Not that there was anything horribly traumitizing about it, my niece didn't have nightmares or anything. However, it required a great deal of explanation and guidance. Hence, it should have been rated PG- Parental Guidance. I expect a G rated movie to be something that doesn't require blow by blow explanations of everything that's going on. My niece had a hard time following the complicated story and I had a hard time caring about it. The animation was nice, but nothing special. Also, I found the gun-toting, gas-masked granny to be way over the top and somewhat frightening for young children. My niece did not like that part at all. I had meant to watch this again without my niece to see if I would have a clearer perspective, but I couldn't work up the enthusiasm for a second viewing.

1100398,A27CHILBK6HIL2,B000VBJEEG,Kaya Savas,"[4, 6]","Before I saw The Incredibles all I knew about Brad Bird was that he was a character designer and animator for The Simpsons and he made the very underrated The Iron Giant. After I saw what he could do with CGI animation I became a Brad Bird believer. You can guess that I was excited to see Ratatouille. Bird is a writer/director that doesn't dumb down animation. For some reason it's believed that animation is for kids only. Television has proved that there is an audience in the key 18-49 demographic for animation. Brad Bird makes movies that can be viewed by anyone, and Ratatouille is no exception.Ratatouille is the story of a rat named Remy who lives with his father and brother and their colony. Remy enjoys good food while his family enjoys eating trash. He wishes one day that he could leave the gutters and go out in the world to cook and create different flavors. After a near-death incident he is separated from his family. While he is alone he conjures up in his imagination the spirit of Chef Gusteau, his idol. Gusteau basically acts as Remy's conscience for the duration of the movie. When Remy discovers he actually lives in Paris he accidentally gets trapped in Gusteau's former restaurant. Linguini is our human protagonist and was just hired as a trash boy for the kitchen. When Remy creates a brilliant soup it is Linguini who gets credit for it and now the two team up to become the best thing to hit Paris. The film is full of colorful characters that are not empty or dull. Every character is developed and completes some journey in this film, which you don't usually see. Usually only your hero goes through the journey, but we come to terms with every fantastic character in the film.The great thing about Ratatouille is that Brad Bird does not dumb the story down just because it's animation. He plays everything for real even though his main character is a talking rat. You see other movies like Meet The Robinsons which have clich&eacute;d characters and humor dumbed down for kids because it's much easier that way. What Brad Bird does is he crafts a story that is simple enough for children to follow and enjoy but he delevopes it in a mature way that an older audience can watch and relate to. During my screening I heard countless of kids asking their parents ""what is going on""? So, there are things here that may fly over a child's head. Things like flashbacks to the childhood of an evil food critic that awakens the life inside of him, blossoming love between two co-workers, or Gusteau's replacement hiding from Linguini that he is the biological heir to the restaurant. The way I saw it is that Remy's story was for the kids. He is a rat who wants to cook and has to overcome society's view of him in order to make it. Linguini's story is for the older audiences as it deals with more real life things kids can't relate to yet. Overall this is a brilliant animated film that makes me love Brad Bird as a filmmaker even more.Another aspect that has to be admired is that the animators have done a wonderful job creating a believable environment. Character design is one thing in animation, but it's the stuff that you don't notice that is the most important. The design of the interiors, the walls, the doors, the floor tiles, the clothing on the characters, the streets, the way the light falls and everything else. I was just amazed at how much detail went into this film. I tried to imagine this as a small budget romantic comedy and felt like the sets were real. The majority of the film takes place in the one restaurant, but the restaurant feels like a world in itself. The film was just simply amazing to watch.One thing that I still remember about The Incredibles is Michael Giacchino's incredible (no pun intended) score. Giacchino has come a long way from scoring video games and thanks to his work on the show Lost he is finally getting some recognition. The role Giacchino's score plays in this movie is indescribable, and it should be since its music and music needs to be heard. It completes the atmosphere that Brad Bird has created. It gives it that French flare that makes you believe you are in France. The score is quiet at times but will kick it up in a jazzy way from time to time. Giacchino composed a song with singer Camille that plays halfway through the film and during the end. It is a perfect incorporation of the themes and gives the film that perfect flavor. I don't speak French so I don't know the vocals, but it's a beautiful piece.We also get some great voice acting. Patton Oswalt was a delight as Remy. Ian Holm played the evil cook, Skinner and you would never know it was him hiding his British accent with a French one. Brad Garret plays the spirit of Chef Gusteau while Janeane Garofalo plays the voice of Linguini's love interest. Linguini himself is played by voice actor Lou Romano. Rounding out the great cast is Peter O' Toole as Anton Ego the evil food critic.The film was a delight. It was beautiful and heartwarming featuring a brilliant story about finding one's self, but most importantly it was original. It wasn't like the rehashed crud you usually find in theaters, and I'm speaking on behalf of both animation and live-action. Brad Bird is a grand talent in the world of animation.",5,And The Oscar For Best Animated Film Goes To . . . Ratatouille.

1100400,A2DCS39GFBJV24,B000VBJEEG,Kenya Starflight,"[0, 0]","Despite loving almost all of Pixar's output over the years, I must admit that I was skeptical when I first heard of ""Ratatouille.""  A cooking rat?  Sounded too cutesy to me.  But given that I had loved all of Pixar's output so far (yes, even ""Cars"") and the director of the film, Brad Bird, has a track record of impressive films that don't stick rigidly to kids-movie formulas (""The Iron Giant,"" ""The Incredibles""), I decided to give it a chance.  If nothing else, I could soak in the glorious animation that Pixar is known for, and enjoy a beautifully animated jaunt in Paris.""Ratatouille"" exceeded my expectations -- it's not a cutesy film, but takes a surprisingly mature look at the restaurant industry, the perilous life of a ""pest"" animal, and finding one's place in the world.The lead character, Remy, is a rat with an extraordinarily heightened sense of smell, which his father, the leader of the colony, puts to use by making him the family poison-checker.  But with heightened smell comes a heightened sense of taste, and disgusted with the garbage his family subsides on, Remy decides to venture into human territory, teaching himself to read, cook, and understand human language.  His fascination with humans gets him separated from his colony, landing him in Paris, and he ends up befriending Linguini, an American young man far from home who's just gotten a job at an upscale Parisian restaurant.  Remy and Linguini form an unlikely partnership that catapults Linguini to culinary stardom... but the duo face opposition from Skinner, the restaurant's scheming owner; Anton Ego, a food critic who takes sadistic delight in ruining the reputation of restaurants he reviews; and Remy's own father, who is certain a partnership between humans and rats can never last.As always with Pixar, the animation is superb.  Paris is gorgeously captured, both its beauty and its dingier side, and the film provides a warm, slightly exotic but still welcoming atmosphere in its setting.  The rats are, well, ratlike, and despite some of their more human mannerisms it's obvious the animators took the time to study how rodents really move in order to portray them accurately.  The human characters manage to hit the right balance between realism and stylistic, a major feat for an animated movie -- it's easy to go too far one way or the other, to make the humans so realistic they look creepy or to make them so stylized they look alien, but ""Ratatouille"" finds the right balance.The story has a few of the usual Disney clich&eacute;s, such as the requisite romance (between Linguini and fellow chef Colette) and the animals with human traits, but at the same time it manages to subvert the usual tropes as well.  While the rats can talk to each other and Remy has no problem understanding Linguini, the ""talking animal"" trope is subverted in that Linguini can't understand Remy, which means the rat must use body language and actions to communicate.  And unusually for a Disney film, it has no problems talking about death and other mature subjects, some of which might go right over kids' heads.  Plus the subplot about the ownership of the restaurant and its various legal and critical problems are plots that rarely come up in a kids' movie, and are likely to make this film appeal to an older demographic.  It's nice to see an animated film that knows that ""parental bonus"" does NOT automatically mean ""sex and toilet humor,"" but ""elements that will interest adults as well as kids.""Another home run from Pixar, one with an unconventional plot and that can appeal to both children and adults.  Probably best for ages 8 and up for scary scenes and some minor adult themes.",5,Unconventional animated film that appeals to both kids and adults,1404950400,"07 10, 2014",2014,3677,"['loving', 'almost', 'Pixar', 'output', 'years', 'must', 'admit', 'was', 'skeptical', 'when', 'first', 'heard', 'Ratatouille', 'cooking', 'rat', 'Sounded', 'too', 'cutesy', 'given', 'had', 'loved', 'Pixar', 'output', 'so', 'far', 'yes', 'even', 'Cars', 'director', 'film', 'Brad', 'Bird', 'track', 'record', 'impressive', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'stick', 'rigidly', 'kids-movie', 'formulas', 'Iron', 'Giant', 'Incredibles', 'decided', 'give', 'chance', 'nothing', 'else', 'could', 'soak', 'glorious', 'animation', 'Pixar', 'known', 'enjoy', 'beautifully', 'animated', 'jaunt', 'Paris', 'Ratatouille', 'exceeded', 'expectations', 'not', 'cutesy', 'film', 'surprisingly', 'mature', 'look', 'restaurant', 'industry', 'perilous', 'life', 'pest', 'animal', 'finding', 'one', 'place', 'world.The', 'lead', 'character', 'Remy', 'rat', 'extraordinarily', 'heightened', 'sense', 'smell', 'father', 'leader', 'colony', 'use', 'making', 'family', 'poison-checker', 'heightened', 'smell', 'heightened', 'sense', 'taste', 'disgusted', 'garbage', 'family', 'subsides', 'Remy', 'venture', 'human', 'territory', 'teaching', 'read', 'cook', 'understand', 'human', 'language', 'fascination', 'humans', 'separated', 'colony', 'landing', 'Paris', 'up', 'befriending', 'Linguini', 'American', 'young', 'man', 'far', 'home', 'who', 'just', 'gotten', 'job', 'upscale', 'Parisian', 'restaurant', 'Remy', 'Linguini', 'form', 'unlikely', 'partnership', 'Linguini', 'culinary', 'stardom', 'duo', 'face', 'opposition', 'Skinner', 'restaurant', 'scheming', 'owner', 'Anton', 'Ego', 'food', 'critic', 'who', 'sadistic', 'delight', 'ruining', 'reputation', 'restaurants', 'Remy', 'own', 'father', 'who', 'certain', 'partnership', 'humans', 'rats', 'can', 'never', 'last.As', 'always', 'Pixar', 'animation', 'superb', 'Paris', 'gorgeously', 'captured', 'beauty', 'dingier', 'side', 'film', 'warm', 'slightly', 'exotic', 'still', 'welcoming', 'atmosphere', 'setting', 'rats', 'are', 'well', 'ratlike', 'more', 'human', 'mannerisms', 'obvious', 'animators', 'took', 'time', 'study', 'how', 'rodents', 'really', 'move', 'order', 'portray', 'accurately', 'human', 'characters', 'manage', 'hit', 'right', 'balance', 'realism', 'stylistic', 'major', 'feat', 'animated', 'movie', 'easy', 'go', 'too', 'far', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'make', 'humans', 'so', 'realistic', 'look', 'creepy', 'make', 'so', 'stylized', 'look', 'alien', 'Ratatouille', 'right', 'balance.The', 'story', 'few', 'usual', 'Disney', 'clich', 'eacute', 'such', 'requisite', 'romance', 'Linguini', 'fellow', 'chef', 'Colette', 'animals', 'human', 'traits', 'same', 'time', 'subvert', 'usual', 'tropes', 'well', 'rats', 'can', 'talk', 'other', 'Remy', 'problem', 'understanding', 'Linguini', 'talking', 'animal', 'trope', 'subverted', 'Linguini', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'Remy', 'rat', 'must', 'use', 'body', 'language', 'actions', 'communicate', 'unusually', 'Disney', 'film', 'problems', 'talking', 'death', 'other', 'mature', 'subjects', 'might', 'go', 'right', 'kids', 'heads', 'subplot', 'ownership', 'restaurant', 'various', 'legal', 'critical', 'problems', 'are', 'plots', 'rarely', 'come', 'up', 'kids', 'movie', 'are', 'likely', 'make', 'film', 'appeal', 'older', 'demographic', 'nice', 'see', 'animated', 'film', 'parental', 'bonus', 'NOT', 'automatically', 'mean', 'sex', 'toilet', 'humor', 'elements', 'will', 'interest', 'adults', 'as', 'well', 'kids', 'home', 'run', 'Pixar', 'one', 'unconventional', 'plot', 'can', 'appeal', 'children', 'adults', 'Probably', 'best', 'ages', '8', 'up', 'scary', 'scenes', 'minor', 'adult', 'themes']",N/A

1100405,A1W661TC1P6VQI,B000VBJEEG,"Kevin T. Rodriguez ""The Movie Wizard.com Revi...","[6, 8]","Movies, like food, are a form of expression and masterwork.  You have all different sorts of movies, and like foods they all have their own individual flavors.  ""A Mighty Heart"" tasted like a tough, juicy meat that may have been difficult to stomach, but leaves a lingering taste in your mouth that you are not soon to forget.  ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"" tasted like a cake that delivered a sugar rush and then left me feeling empty.  ""Live Free and Die Hard"" tasted like a fast food meal, which was tasty and yummy, but easily disposable.  If Pixar's latest film ""Ratatouille"" is to be compared to food (and it would be an insult not to bring in a food metaphor), then I would say it was like a home cooked meal by a family member.  The texture is fleeting but rich.  The taste simple yet powerful.  The meal short but filling.In other words, we have a strong contender for one of the best films of the year.  Like the great chefs they are, the genius's at Pixar have perfected another great movie.  This one is about a rat named Remy, who is going through a bit of an emotional crisis.  He has a wonderful gift of smell that can tell the difference between different spices, textures, and smells of food, the kind of scent many aspiring chefs wish they could have.  Remy has this gift, and then finds himself reduced to using his gift to sniff garbage his rat pact brings him to make sure there's no poison in their loot (come to think of it, I'd be in a bad mood too if I was stuck with that job).  Remy feels an urge to do something more with his life, and gets that chance when he ends up helping a hopeless Italian boy named Alfredo Linguini cook food for a three star restaurant.The restaurant, known as ""Gusteau's,"" used to be a five star restaurant, but lost a couple of stars from a nasty food critic, and is now on the verge of selling out to cheap TV dinners and frozen tacos as a way to make money.  Remy saves the reputation of the restaurant by cooking some winning meals through Linguini, who starts complicating matters by falling in love with his (only) female co-worker, a tough but kind French woman named Colette.  And here is where you'll find the difference between a great movie and a bad movie.  A dish that is filling and wonderful to savor, while other dishes are simply cotton candy.  This movie is alive.  It understands characters, it understands emotions, it knows what is worth telling.The visual style is a key ingredient in this movie, as there are many scenes where Remy envisions what his meals are going to taste like, and it's done with a simple but powerful visual element where we can see his taste buds in colorful style.  Think of the number trick in ""A Beautiful Mind"" and replace the computer graphics with hippy colors.  The characters come off as hopeless but realistic.  Contrary to what the previews show, Linguini and Collete do harbor feelings for each other, and it's fun to watch how their love for each other developed.  The movie takes it's time to let the two fall in love, and as an added side dish, we get to see them in an actual relationship for a good portion of the film.  The previews thankfully didn't give away a majority of the story twists in the movie, and so much of the story came as a surprise to me.I felt like a customer who ordered something from a menu, saw the ingredients, but wasn't prepared for how good it was going to taste.  A small role for the legendary Academy Award winning star Peter O'Toole is not a gimmicky ""look, we got Peter O'Toole"" moment, but rather fully fleshed out supporting role.  At the end of the movie O'Toole's character give a great speech about how critics have fairly easy jobs.  They have little to risk, the power of their opinion doesn't always have an effect on the population, but people put their works in front of critics with the hope that they will write positive things about their work.  This scene brought a tear to my eye, I must admit.""Ratatouille"" is the best animated film I've seen this year.  It's one of the best films of the year.  It's Pixar's best film since ""Finding Nemo,"" and it's my third favorite Pixar movie behind the aforementioned ""Finding Nemo"" and ""Toy Story 2.""  That stupid French song by Camille is so darn catchy I'm listening to it on my iPod while I type this review right now.  It's a shame that critics don't have much power with their recommendations anymore. $50 million dollar advertising campaigns have made critics warnings of bad movies something that isn't taken seriously anymore, while reviews of good movies don't help a film much anymore.  If this movie fails to make at least $200 million dollars I'm going to be really, really ticked off.  It's bad enough that ""Spider-Man 3"" and ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"" sucked up cash it didn't deserve, but now there are predictions that ""Ratatouille"" may be a bomb at the box office.I really pray that this isn't the case.  I pray people read good reviews, that they see this wonderful film, and that they see it again if there is nothing else worth seeing (and that's a very strong probability at this point in time).  But I get this nagging feels that the critics voice will not be heard, and that people are going to skip a truly wonderful film because there's not as much marketing money thrown behind it.  Oh well, people choosing things that cater to the lowest common denominator over quality products is nothing new, and is certainly expected these days.  After all, when you have Wendy's, Burger King, Jack In The Box, In-N-Out Burger, and Carl's Jr. out there, it's amazing to find that people still choose to go to McDonald's.

I was charmed by the positive picture painted of rats in general by this movie and I hope as a result that people will become more tolerant of these delightful creatures.While rated G and made with plenty of slap-stick type humor for the kiddies, it also had plenty of more subtle undertones allowing adults to enjoy it as well.Remy, a young rat, lives with his mischief (the proper term for a group of rats) in the French countryside. Unlike the rest of his family, he has a very sensitive nose and discerning taste buds and enjoys the taste of fine foods. One day, when by the scent of it he discovers that some of the food his father was about to eat is poisoned, he is subsequently given the job of checking to make sure the food they are gathering is safe to eat - by sniffing each piece. He is discontent in this and seeks more - he is fascinated by humans and especially with the notion of food and cooking.He becomes interested in Chef Gusteau, who has a television program Remy has seen while raiding the kitchen of the house near his mischief, and whose motto is ""Anyone can cook."" Unfortunately one day he overstays his welcome and the elderly lady who lives there catches him and his brother, eventually uncovering the entire mischief, forcing them to evacuate.Ending up in Paris, separated from his family because he went back into the house to get Chef Gusteau's cookbook, Remy stumbles upon Gusteau's restaurant. He eventually befriends an awkward young man who has just been hired on as a garbage boy. Through the sorts of coincidences only found in this sort of movie, Linguine is made a chef - with Remy pulling his strings (literally).Much of this movie is about with following your dreams, and becoming who you need to be, doing what you are meant to do, no matter what sorts of pressure others put on you, no matter what hardships come your way. It is about friendship and loyalty and trust. I loved it.

1100427,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,B000VBJEEG,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[5, 8]","My experience with rats in movies is generally not positive.  There were the killer rats in ""Ben"" and ""Willard,"" the over-sized rats in ""Food of the Gods,"" and the mega-rats in ""Graveyard Shift.""  Even though ""Ratatouille"" had a lot of positive press well before I purchased this movie, I must confess to being apprehensive.  My apprehension was (mostly) unfounded.Remy is an unusual mouse in that he likes to watch the cooking shows of the famous chef, Gusteau.  Remy also has an excellent nose, which his family puts to use to detect poisonous food.  Of course, Remy just wants to cook.  A farmer's wife discovers Remy during one of his sojourns into a farmhouse kitchen.  Remy's discovery soon leads to the discovery of his family and a hasty departure from the farm.After a harrowing journey, Remy ends up in Paris.  Remy soon finds his way to Gusteau's restaurant where he joins forces with Linguini, who is inept in just about everything he does, except for being Remy's hands.  Soon Linguini impresses everyone with his cooking ability, except for Chef Skinner, who planned on capitalizing on Gusteau's name by franchising it.  Linguini's apparent abilities make the restaurant famous again, until the local health inspector discovers rats in the kitchen.I enjoyed this movie.  I thought it was very creative.  I would never have thought of putting a rat into a restaurant as a chef.  I also thought having a rat control the actions of a human was an interesting twist on the usual role of rats in movies.  I laughed out loud in several places while watching this movie.  Some of the jokes were hilarious.  Other jokes were a little flat.  I also think there were some insider jokes, which were lost on me.  I liked the characters of Remy, Collette (wonderfully voiced by Jeneane Garofalo), Chef Skinner and most especially Anton Ego (extremely well voiced by Peter O'Toole).With all that I liked about this movie, I had a couple of issues, one structural and one personal.The structural issue is that the movie, which is pushing two hours in length, has some slow spots.  I found myself looking at the display on the DVD player to see how long the movie had been on.  I only do that when a movie fails to hold my interest.The personal problem I had was the scene with the rats in the restaurant.  It was bad enough when Remy was sitting on Linguini's hand, and then Linguini was handling food (ewwww), but to see all those rats in the restaurant all over the food preparation surfaces got to me.  Sorry, but that scene was yucky.This release has a nice share of extras.  The two best extras are the shorts, ""Lifted,"" which is very funny, and ""Your Friend the Rat,"" which is pretty good but not quite as funny as ""Lifted.""  There are deleted scenes that fans of the movie will enjoy, though they are still close to the storyboard stage.  There is another feature called ""Fine Food and Film,"" which suggests some of the inspiration for the movie.  This movie also has a bunch of Easter eggs in it, but other web sites have already covered those well, so I will not repeat them here.If you like animation, especially Pixar's, then you will probably like ""Ratatouille.""  The characters are sympathetic and fun, and the humor is as well.  The only troubling scene is one involving food preparation in a restaurant and hundreds of mice.  Children will doubtless have little problem with the thought of rodents scampering over the scallions, or rats romping in the risotto.  That scene still makes me queasy.Enjoy!",4,"Cute, Clever & Funny, but Rats in the Kitchen?",1195776000,"11 23, 2007",2007,3515,"['experience', 'rats', 'movies', 'generally', 'not', 'positive', 'were', 'killer', 'rats', 'Ben', 'Willard', 'over-sized', 'rats', 'Food', 'Gods', 'mega-rats', 'Graveyard', 'Shift', 'Even', 'Ratatouille', 'had', 'lot', 'positive', 'press', 'well', 'purchased', 'movie', 'must', 'confess', 'being', 'apprehensive', 'apprehension', 'was', 'mostly', 'unfounded.Remy', 'unusual', 'mouse', 'watch', 'cooking', 'shows', 'famous', 'chef', 'Gusteau', 'Remy', 'also', 'excellent', 'nose', 'family', 'use', 'detect', 'poisonous', 'food', 'course', 'Remy', 'just', 'cook', 'farmer', 'wife', 'discovers', 'Remy', 'one', 'sojourns', 'farmhouse', 'kitchen', 'Remy', 'discovery', 'soon', 'discovery', 'family', 'hasty', 'departure', 'farm.After', 'harrowing', 'journey', 'Remy', 'up', 'Paris', 'Remy', 'soon', 'way', 'Gusteau', 'restaurant', 'where', 'forces', 'Linguini', 'who', 'inept', 'just', 'everything', 'except', 'being', 'Remy', 'hands', 'Soon', 'Linguini', 'everyone', 'cooking', 'ability', 'Chef', 'Skinner', 'who', 'planned', 'capitalizing', 'Gusteau', 'name', 'franchising', 'Linguini', 'apparent', 'abilities', 'make', 'restaurant', 'famous', 'again', 'local', 'health', 'inspector', 'discovers', 'rats', 'kitchen.I', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'creative', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'thought', 'putting', 'rat', 'restaurant', 'chef', 'also', 'thought', 'having', 'rat', 'control', 'actions', 'human', 'was', 'interesting', 'twist', 'usual', 'role', 'rats', 'movies', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'several', 'places', 'watching', 'movie', 'jokes', 'were', 'hilarious', 'Other', 'jokes', 'were', 'little', 'flat', 'also', 'think', 'were', 'insider', 'jokes', 'were', 'lost', 'liked', 'characters', 'Remy', 'Collette', 'wonderfully', 'voiced', 'Jeneane', 'Garofalo', 'Chef', 'Skinner', 'most', 'especially', 'Anton', 'Ego', 'extremely', 'well', 'voiced', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", '.With', 'liked', 'movie', 'had', 'couple', 'issues', 'one', 'structural', 'one', 'personal.The', 'structural', 'issue', 'movie', 'pushing', 'two', 'hours', 'length', 'slow', 'spots', 'found', 'looking', 'display', 'DVD', 'player', 'see', 'how', 'long', 'movie', 'had', 'been', 'only', 'do', 'when', 'movie', 'hold', 'interest.The', 'personal', 'problem', 'had', 'was', 'scene', 'rats', 'restaurant', 'was', 'bad', 'enough', 'when', 'Remy', 'was', 'sitting', 'Linguini', 'hand', 'then', 'Linguini', 'was', 'handling', 'food', 'ewwww', 'see', 'rats', 'restaurant', 'food', 'preparation', 'surfaces', 'got', 'Sorry', 'scene', 'was', 'yucky.This', 'release', 'nice', 'share', 'extras', 'two', 'best', 'extras', 'are', 'shorts', 'Lifted', 'very', 'funny', 'Friend', 'Rat', 'pretty', 'good', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'funny', 'Lifted', 'are', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'fans', 'movie', 'will', 'enjoy', 'are', 'still', 'close', 'storyboard', 'stage', 'feature', 'called', 'Fine', 'Food', 'Film', 'inspiration', 'movie', 'movie', 'also', 'bunch', 'Easter', 'eggs', 'other', 'web', 'sites', 'have', 'already', 'covered', 'well', 'will', 'not', 'repeat', 'here.If', 'animation', 'especially', 'Pixar', 'then', 'will', 'probably', 'Ratatouille', 'characters', 'are', 'sympathetic', 'fun', 'humor', 'as', 'well', 'only', 'troubling', 'scene', 'one', 'involving', 'food', 'preparation', 'restaurant', 'hundreds', 'mice', 'Children', 'will', 'doubtless', 'have', 'little', 'problem', 'thought', 'rodents', 'scampering', 'scallions', 'rats', 'romping', 'risotto', 'scene', 'still', 'queasy.Enjoy']",N/A

You might think that this would be an insurmountable handicap in the chef-business, but I can assure you that true ratliness would be a step up for a few in the profession. Anyway, the ratchef, Remy survives a series of threats to his life and comes to pursue the career for which he has such aptitude.The animation is wonderful, someone obviously paid a lot of attention to how things happen in kitchens. The dialog sparkles and the message of triumph over prejudice doesn't get in the way of a taut little story. What struck me particularly was that this was a completely new image of fine food and the people who create it.For years, the chef and the gourmet have been portrayed as snobs, boors, egotists and phonies. This is the first cartoon and one of the first films of any kind to take food and eating seriously and to respect both the talent and the labor that go into making them happen.Pixar is also to be congratulated for showing the enjoyment of wine as part of the enjoyment of life and food. It's very rare that kids get to see images of wine being enjoyed-and delighted in-by responsible adults. It's no wonder that so many young people grow up with the idea that abstinence and drunkenness are the only ways to deal with wine and beer in their lives.It's also a pleasure to see an awkward adolescent (Linguini) coming slowly into his own.

It is so sensitive that he can even detect when the food contains rat poison. His sense of smell leads him to a world of flavors and a love of great food. Though his family looks at any scraps as just energy to fuel the body, Remy has other ideas. So ignoring his father's advice he sets out to fulfill his dream of experiencing great food. Once he finds out he is actually living below Paris, he decides he must become a chef and fulfill his greater desire of creating great food. And it just so happens that he is living beneath the restaurant of his culinary hero, Augusted Gusteau. Remy quickly forms a bond with the garbage boy, Linguini.

His hero is the late, great chef Gusteau (Brad Garrett), and thanks to his TV show and cookbook, Remy has the knowledge to be one of the best chefs in the world.  The only problem?  Remy's a rat.When Remy's family is forced to evacuate their home, Remy gets separated from them.  He winds up in Paris just outside of Gusteau's restaurant.  Since he can't resist seeing where his idol once worked, Remy sneaks inside.And that's how Remy meets Linguini (Lou Romano).  Linguini is the new garbage boy at the restaurant, and he's something of a klutz.  When Linguini accidentally ruins a soup, Remy can't help but fix it.  The new recipe is a huge success, but only Linguini knows that a rat made it.And so beings their partnership.  Remy provides the cooking knowledge and Linguini provides the human form.  Together, they begin to turn the reputation of the restaurant around.  But can they keep their secret hidden?I have been a Pixar fan since Toy Story was released, but this was the first one I didn't love.  Maybe it's director Brad Bird since I didn't like his The Iron Giant, and I had to watch The Incredibles a couple times before I truly enjoyed it.Maybe I'll enjoy this one more after I see it a few more times because there are lots of things to recommend it.  There are some truly funny parts, especially the scenes where Remy is trying to control Linguini.  And their first scene working together is a riot as well.  The animation is wonderful with a few breath taking shots of Paris.  And I liked the fact that Remy could only talk to other rats.  The fact that the humans and animals couldn't talk is a nice twist on the standard animated film.  And the animators do a great job of using body language to convey their characters every thought and feeling.  And the voice cast of well knowns and unknowns does an excellent job.So where exactly did the movie fall apart?  It was just too busy.  Remy has a storyline with a couple plots.  Linguini has his own issues.  And neither one is really given time to develop fully.  We focus on one issue for a while, then move on to something else.  Item three gets resolved, then we get item four before going back to two, then five, then....  You get the idea.  If they had taken out one of the sub-plots, anyone of them, it would have allowed more time to better develop the plots that remained and even develop the characters better.Then there's the fact that the movie really isn't aimed at kids.  I'm not arguing with the G rating.  There just isn't that much action to hold their interest.  Elementary age and above should be able to track the story, so they will enjoy it more.This is an entertaining movie that is worth seeing.

1100442,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B000VBJEEG,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[20, 20]","Ratatouille tells the most unlikely story of Remy, a rat who disdains garbage and wants nothing more than to cook and eat gourmet food. Ratatouille progresses at a good pace and it held my attention all the way! The animation is excellent and the voiceovers are very nicely done.When the action begins, we meet Remy (voiced by Patton Oswalt), a rat who must run for safety along with the other rats when they are discovered by the old woman whose attic they inhabit; and this is after poor Remy has already been ""relegated"" to food inspector to make sure that no food is poisoned. Remy's father only complains that his son Remy is way too picky about food; and Remy's brother Emile (voiced by Peter Sohn) ""tolerates"" Remy even though he doesn't understand Remy's desire for gourmet food.After a harrowing, close escape from the woman whose house they inhabited, Remy finds himself alone in the sewers of Paris. He has lost his way and he doesn't know where his fellow rats and his family are. However, he soon discovers that he is underneath the kitchen of his idol chef, Chef Gusteau (voiced by Brad Garrett) who has written a book entitled ""Anyone Can Cook."" Eventually Remy wanders into the kitchen and risks his life to see what goes on there, although he is saddened when he earlier discovers that Chef Gusteau is now deceased.Things become even wilder! Remy saves the day for a young, newly hired garbage boy named Linguini (voiced by Lou Romano); Linguini cooks a terrible soup and Remy secretly adds a few things to make the soup even more then perfect. Pretty soon Remy and Linguini actually form a partnership with Remy hiding under Linguini's chef cap and tugging on Linguini's hair (either left or right with his rat paws) to tell Linguini what to put in the soup to make it wonderful. Linguini's subsequent success is extremely disturbing to the crude, bullying chef in charge Chef Skinner (voiced by Ian Holm). Chef Skinner tries to get Linguini to admit that a rat is behind his success; but Linguini never admits anything even when Skinner gets him drunk.Of course, from here the plot can go anywhere. Will Skinner be able to hide the secret that the restaurant belongs to Chef Gusteau's son--Linguini? What if Linguini and Colette (voiced by Janeane Garofalo), another cook in the kitchen, begin a romance--will this complicate things or help things along? What becomes of Remy--will he stay in the kitchen working with Linguini? Will Remy ever find his family? And what happens when the nasty restaurant critic Anton Ego (voiced by Peter O'Toole) wants to destroy Chef Gusteau's restaurant's reputation? No plot spoilers here, folks--just watch the movie and find out!The DVD has a plethora of extras. You get an interview with the writer and producer; and there are three deleted scenes. There's also a short animated film entitled Lifted.Ratatouille is a strong film from Disney and Pixar, although I do agree with other reviewers that the film could have been tightened up a bit to run a few minutes shorter. This is an excellent family movie but there is, of course, the possibility that some won't be enchanted by the images of rats running en masse through restaurant kitchens. However, all of this didn't bother me too much, so I heartily recommend this movie.",5,another great movie courtesy of Pixar and Disney,1211068800,"05 18, 2008",2008,3285,"['Ratatouille', 'most', 'unlikely', 'story', 'Remy', 'rat', 'who', 'garbage', 'nothing', 'more', 'cook', 'eat', 'gourmet', 'food', 'Ratatouille', 'good', 'pace', 'held', 'attention', 'way', 'animation', 'excellent', 'voiceovers', 'are', 'very', 'nicely', 'done.When', 'action', 'meet', 'Remy', 'voiced', 'Patton', 'Oswalt', 'rat', 'who', 'must', 'run', 'safety', 'other', 'rats', 'when', 'are', 'discovered', 'old', 'woman', 'attic', 'inhabit', 'poor', 'Remy', 'already', 'been', 'relegated', 'food', 'inspector', 'make', 'sure', 'food', 'poisoned', 'Remy', 'father', 'only', 'son', 'Remy', 'way', 'too', 'picky', 'food', 'Remy', 'brother', 'Emile', 'voiced', 'Peter', 'Sohn', 'tolerates', 'Remy', 'even', ""n't"", 'understand', 'Remy', 'desire', 'gourmet', 'food.After', 'harrowing', 'close', 'escape', 'woman', 'house', 'inhabited', 'Remy', 'alone', 'sewers', 'Paris', 'lost', 'way', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'fellow', 'rats', 'family', 'are', 'However', 'soon', 'kitchen', 'idol', 'chef', 'Chef', 'Gusteau', 'voiced', 'Brad', 'Garrett', 'who', 'written', 'book', 'entitled', 'Anyone', 'Can', 'Cook', 'Eventually', 'Remy', 'wanders', 'kitchen', 'risks', 'life', 'see', 'what', 'there', 'saddened', 'when', 'earlier', 'discovers', 'Chef', 'Gusteau', 'now', 'become', 'even', 'wilder', 'Remy', 'day', 'young', 'newly', 'hired', 'garbage', 'boy', 'named', 'Linguini', 'voiced', 'Lou', 'Romano', 'Linguini', 'terrible', 'soup', 'Remy', 'secretly', 'few', 'things', 'make', 'soup', 'even', 'more', 'then', 'perfect', 'Pretty', 'soon', 'Remy', 'Linguini', 'actually', 'partnership', 'Remy', 'hiding', 'Linguini', 'chef', 'cap', 'tugging', 'Linguini', 'hair', 'left', 'right', 'rat', 'paws', 'tell', 'Linguini', 'what', 'put', 'soup', 'make', 'wonderful', 'Linguini', 'subsequent', 'success', 'extremely', 'disturbing', 'crude', 'bullying', 'chef', 'charge', 'Chef', 'Skinner', 'voiced', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'Chef', 'Skinner', 'get', 'Linguini', 'admit', 'rat', 'success', 'Linguini', 'never', 'anything', 'even', 'when', 'Skinner', 'drunk.Of', 'course', 'here', 'plot', 'can', 'go', 'anywhere', 'Will', 'Skinner', 'be', 'able', 'hide', 'secret', 'restaurant', 'Chef', 'Gusteau', 'son', 'Linguini', 'What', 'Linguini', 'Colette', 'voiced', 'Janeane', 'Garofalo', 'cook', 'kitchen', 'begin', 'romance', 'will', 'complicate', 'things', 'help', 'things', 'along', 'What', 'Remy', 'will', 'stay', 'kitchen', 'working', 'Linguini', 'Will', 'Remy', 'ever', 'find', 'family', 'what', 'when', 'nasty', 'restaurant', 'critic', 'Anton', 'Ego', 'voiced', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'destroy', 'Chef', 'Gusteau', 'restaurant', 'reputation', 'plot', 'spoilers', 'here', 'folks', 'just', 'watch', 'movie', 'find', 'out', 'DVD', 'plethora', 'extras', 'get', 'interview', 'writer', 'producer', 'are', 'three', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'also', 'short', 'animated', 'film', 'entitled', 'Lifted.Ratatouille', 'strong', 'film', 'Disney', 'Pixar', 'do', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'tightened', 'up', 'bit', 'run', 'few', 'minutes', 'shorter', 'excellent', 'family', 'movie', 'course', 'possibility', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'enchanted', 'images', 'rats', 'running', 'en', 'masse', 'restaurant', 'kitchens', 'However', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'too', 'much', 'heartily', 'recommend', 'movie']",N/A

I treated myself to Robin Hood and Sword In The Stone. Those were the two I could find. The rest I had no interest in even picking up. Disney movies never appealed to me after Pocahontas came out, and I've rarely watched one since. The big movies recently have been the Incredibles, Finding Nemo, Cars etc, some with Pixar at the helm. But I never jumped at the chance to get any of them. They just didn't have the same appeal as the old Disney classics.Instead of sitting at home after a long day at work, I decided to go see this with my boyfriend, which meant lots of rushing about trying to make myself look presentable, but surprisingly worth it. Many of the people I work with know of my distaste for animation, and instantly said I wouldn't enjoy this.There were a handful of kids at the cinema. The rest were adults. I'm still not keen on being in the cinema with kids - there was a child a few rows in front of us, who got taken to the toilet a couple of times, but who was always away for at least 20 minutes! Why bother? And then there was the child who had a seriously high pitched laugh, and who I'm yet to figure out whether it was a boy or girl.Ratatouille surprised me, it really did. From the pre-credit sequence (something that doesn't seem to really match up to the rest of the movie) which was hilarious, to Remy, the rat with a taste for good cuisine, the movie was good. Slightly too long for my taste, I was starting to get restless, but it was funny, and well done. The pre-credit sequence with the aliens, was so funny, and I've been walking around the day after seeing it, and laughing to myself.What I enjoyed most about this was the lack of real celebrity voices. There were three I could pick out, maximum. Peter O'Toole was the voice of Anton Ego, Janeane Garofalo was the voice of Collette, and Jamie Oliver (famous British chef) is the voice of the health inspector. Normally these days every character is voiced by a celebrity.The plot is quite funny, although will make you hungry, but I won't give any of it away here. There is a story behind this, which is basically don't let anyone tell you that you can't do something. You can and you will. I thought it was quite subtle. It is quite simplistic at the same time, from the animation style, to the story. Whether it will become a classic I don't know, but I've added the DVD to my wishlist, as I really want to watch that pre-credit sequence again. I can't persuade anyone to go see this film, I wouldn't have managed to persuade ME to go see this film, but I like it when I get surprised by a movie I wouldn't have thought I would have liked.",3,Has restored my faith in Disney movies,1192233600,"10 13, 2007",2007,2709,"['been', 'buy', 'one', 'get', 'one', 'free', 'deal', 'Disney', 'movies', 'UK', 'recently', 'treated', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'Sword', 'Stone', 'were', 'two', 'could', 'find', 'rest', 'had', 'interest', 'even', 'picking', 'up', 'Disney', 'movies', 'never', 'appealed', 'Pocahontas', 'came', 'out', ""'ve"", 'rarely', 'watched', 'one', 'big', 'movies', 'recently', 'have', 'been', 'Incredibles', 'Finding', 'Nemo', 'Cars', 'etc', 'Pixar', 'helm', 'never', 'jumped', 'chance', 'get', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'same', 'appeal', 'old', 'Disney', 'classics.Instead', 'sitting', 'home', 'long', 'day', 'work', 'decided', 'go', 'see', 'boyfriend', 'meant', 'lots', 'rushing', 'trying', 'make', 'look', 'presentable', 'surprisingly', 'worth', 'Many', 'people', 'work', 'know', 'distaste', 'animation', 'instantly', 'said', 'would', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'were', 'handful', 'kids', 'cinema', 'rest', 'were', 'adults', ""'m"", 'still', 'not', 'keen', 'being', 'cinema', 'kids', 'was', 'child', 'few', 'rows', 'front', 'who', 'got', 'taken', 'toilet', 'couple', 'times', 'who', 'was', 'always', 'away', 'least', '20', 'minutes', 'Why', 'bother', 'then', 'was', 'child', 'who', 'had', 'seriously', 'high', 'pitched', 'laugh', 'who', ""'m"", 'yet', 'figure', 'out', 'was', 'boy', 'girl.Ratatouille', 'surprised', 'really', 'did', 'pre-credit', 'sequence', 'something', ""n't"", 'seem', 'really', 'match', 'up', 'rest', 'movie', 'was', 'hilarious', 'Remy', 'rat', 'taste', 'good', 'cuisine', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'Slightly', 'too', 'long', 'taste', 'was', 'starting', 'get', 'restless', 'was', 'funny', 'well', 'done', 'pre-credit', 'sequence', 'aliens', 'was', 'so', 'funny', ""'ve"", 'been', 'walking', 'day', 'seeing', 'laughing', 'myself.What', 'enjoyed', 'most', 'was', 'lack', 'real', 'celebrity', 'voices', 'were', 'three', 'could', 'pick', 'out', 'maximum', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'was', 'voice', 'Anton', 'Ego', 'Janeane', 'Garofalo', 'was', 'voice', 'Collette', 'Jamie', 'Oliver', 'famous', 'British', 'chef', 'voice', 'health', 'inspector', 'Normally', 'days', 'character', 'voiced', 'celebrity.The', 'plot', 'quite', 'funny', 'will', 'make', 'hungry', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'here', 'story', 'basically', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'anyone', 'tell', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'something', 'can', 'will', 'thought', 'was', 'quite', 'subtle', 'quite', 'simplistic', 'same', 'time', 'animation', 'style', 'story', 'will', 'become', 'classic', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'ve"", 'added', 'DVD', 'wishlist', 'really', 'want', 'watch', 'pre-credit', 'sequence', 'again', 'ca', ""n't"", 'persuade', 'anyone', 'go', 'see', 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'managed', 'persuade', 'ME', 'go', 'see', 'film', 'like', 'when', 'get', 'surprised', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'thought', 'would', 'have', 'liked']",N/A

Remy, a very likeable rat, has a gourmet nose and amazing culinary skills. Sadly, his dreams of becoming a chef seem pretty farfetched due to the limitations of his species. However, Remy eventually teams up with Linguini, a gangly young man who lands a job as a garbage boy in one of the most famous restaurants in Paris. Linguini is quite possibly the worst cook ever, but he and Remy devise a method of working together in the kitchen: Remy hides under Linguini's white chef's hat and tugs on the boy's hair to give him commands. As a result, Linguini quickly becomes one of the most sought-after cooks in all of Paris, with a lot of help from his ""little chef.""Even though this is a Pixar/Disney film, there's something about it that reminds me of the classic animated cartoons from many, many years ago (you know, when Disney cartoons were actually good). ""Ratatouille"" is visually stunning and a joy to watch. The characters appear to be three-dimensional, and the beautiful Parisian scenery is a great background throughout the film. There are so many amazing characters in this movie, too: scruffy and adorable Remy, bumbling Linguini, sassy Colette, and Skinner (my personal favorite), an angry little man who reminds me of a non-monkey version of Mojo Jojo from ""The Powerpuff Girls.""I loved, loved, LOVED this movie!

1100453,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B000VBJEEG,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[4, 5]","I love just about everything Pixar puts out.  What's so refreshing about their approach is the male-centric perspective the movies bring, be it a single father searching for his son (Finding Nemo), a single male learning the responsibility of raising a child (Monsters, Inc.), or male bonding between friends (Toy Story).  And then there's Ratatouille.Our rat hero, Remy (Patton Oswalt), is a rat who wants to be a chef.  Our human hero, Linguini (Lou Romano), is a garbage boy for the fine French restaurant Gusteau's with a mysterious past who just wants to get the girl (Colette, voiced by Jeanine Garofalo). These two eventually cross paths and struggle with the boundaries that separate man from rodent, the untalented from the prodigy.  Remy strikes out on his own and gets a job (of sorts), distancing himself from his family and friends. Linguini struggles to impress Colette in the kitchen under the devious watch of Skinner (Ian Holm). Throughout we hear the mantra: ""Anyone can cook!"" as espoused by the ghostly ""figment of Remy's imagination,"" August Gusteau (Brad Garrett).Unlike the other Pixar movies that are tightly focused on a single core message and convey it beautifully, Ratatouille is all over the place.  Will Remy convince his family that striking out on his own was a good idea?  Will he make it as a rat turned chef?  Can he keep up his faade as a puppet master of Linguini's cooking talent?  Speaking of Linguini, what is his mysterious background all about?  Will Linguini convince Colette of his love? Will Skinner figure out Linguini has no talent for cooking?  And what IS Linguini's talent anyway? Will Skinner get away with his plans to sully the reputation of Gusteau's restaurant through blatant commercialization?But that's not what Ratatouille is all about.  It's actually about the crypt-like critic known as Anton Ego (voiced by Peter O'Toole with creaky menace). He is a bitter, unlikable skeleton of a man, thin where Gusteau was fat.  Ego doesn't like food; he claims that he loves it, and if he doesn't love it, ""I don't SWALLOW."" Somewhere in the course of Ego's career as a food critic, he lost track of what makes life enjoyable.  It's up to our dynamic duo to convince him otherwise.So the message isn't actually about whether or not anyone can cook.  It's about remembering what matters about food: not the taste so much as the feelings and memories associated with it.  Unfortunately, that message is muddled by all the other questions laid out in the film.As a result of all the other plotlines, some of the characters become one-dimensional.  The rats are more fleshed out than the humans.  In fact, Linguini seems like such a doofus with no actual skill that it's hard to care about his plight or what Colette sees in him.  It's implied that his true calling is as a roller-skating waiter, but that talent appears in the last few minutes of the film.Ratatouille wraps up with Ego's epiphany, another human who isn't fleshed out nearly as much as his counterparts.  The fairytale ending is a bit hard to swallow, but that probably depends on your opinion of rats in a kitchen.  Overall, Ratatouille has a lot of heart but not a lot of art, and the film's lack of focus prevents it from becoming a true Pixar classic.",4,A Bit Hard to Swallow,1202169600,"02 5, 2008",2008,3268,"['love', 'just', 'everything', 'Pixar', 'out', 'What', 'so', 'refreshing', 'approach', 'male-centric', 'perspective', 'movies', 'bring', 'be', 'single', 'father', 'searching', 'son', 'Finding', 'Nemo', 'single', 'male', 'learning', 'responsibility', 'raising', 'child', 'Monsters', 'Inc.', 'male', 'bonding', 'friends', 'Toy', 'Story', 'then', 'Ratatouille.Our', 'rat', 'hero', 'Remy', 'Patton', 'Oswalt', 'rat', 'who', 'be', 'chef', 'human', 'hero', 'Linguini', 'Lou', 'Romano', 'garbage', 'boy', 'fine', 'French', 'restaurant', 'Gusteau', 'mysterious', 'past', 'who', 'just', 'get', 'girl', 'Colette', 'voiced', 'Jeanine', 'Garofalo', 'two', 'eventually', 'cross', 'paths', 'struggle', 'boundaries', 'separate', 'man', 'rodent', 'untalented', 'prodigy', 'Remy', 'out', 'own', 'job', 'sorts', 'distancing', 'family', 'friends', 'Linguini', 'impress', 'Colette', 'kitchen', 'devious', 'watch', 'Skinner', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'hear', 'mantra', 'Anyone', 'can', 'cook', 'espoused', 'ghostly', 'figment', 'Remy', 'imagination', 'August', 'Gusteau', 'Brad', 'Garrett', 'other', 'Pixar', 'movies', 'are', 'tightly', 'focused', 'single', 'core', 'message', 'convey', 'beautifully', 'Ratatouille', 'place', 'Will', 'Remy', 'convince', 'family', 'striking', 'out', 'own', 'was', 'good', 'idea', 'Will', 'make', 'rat', 'turned', 'chef', 'Can', 'keep', 'up', 'faade', 'puppet', 'master', 'Linguini', 'cooking', 'talent', 'Speaking', 'Linguini', 'what', 'mysterious', 'Will', 'Linguini', 'convince', 'Colette', 'love', 'Will', 'Skinner', 'figure', 'out', 'Linguini', 'talent', 'cooking', 'what', 'IS', 'Linguini', 'talent', 'anyway', 'Will', 'Skinner', 'get', 'away', 'plans', 'sully', 'reputation', 'Gusteau', 'restaurant', 'blatant', 'commercialization', 'not', 'what', 'Ratatouille', 'actually', 'crypt-like', 'critic', 'known', 'Anton', 'Ego', 'voiced', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'creaky', 'menace', 'bitter', 'unlikable', 'skeleton', 'man', 'thin', 'where', 'Gusteau', 'was', 'fat', 'Ego', ""n't"", 'like', 'food', ""n't"", 'love', 'do', ""n't"", 'SWALLOW', 'Somewhere', 'course', 'Ego', 'career', 'food', 'critic', 'lost', 'track', 'what', 'life', 'enjoyable', 'up', 'dynamic', 'duo', 'convince', 'otherwise.So', 'message', ""n't"", 'actually', 'not', 'anyone', 'can', 'cook', 'remembering', 'what', 'food', 'not', 'taste', 'so', 'much', 'feelings', 'memories', 'associated', 'Unfortunately', 'message', 'muddled', 'other', 'questions', 'laid', 'out', 'film.As', 'result', 'other', 'plotlines', 'characters', 'become', 'one-dimensional', 'rats', 'are', 'more', 'fleshed', 'humans', 'fact', 'Linguini', 'doofus', 'actual', 'skill', 'hard', 'care', 'plight', 'what', 'Colette', 'implied', 'true', 'calling', 'roller-skating', 'waiter', 'talent', 'last', 'few', 'minutes', 'film.Ratatouille', 'up', 'Ego', 'epiphany', 'human', 'who', ""n't"", 'fleshed', 'out', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'counterparts', 'fairytale', 'ending', 'bit', 'hard', 'swallow', 'probably', 'opinion', 'rats', 'kitchen', 'Overall', 'Ratatouille', 'lot', 'heart', 'not', 'lot', 'art', 'film', 'lack', 'focus', 'prevents', 'becoming', 'true', 'Pixar', 'classic']",N/A

The story line is original, too: Remy is a French country boy with the makings of a great chef, but there's one big problem. He's a rat. Having found himself in Paris at the restaurant of his late hero, Chef Gusteau, Remy meets up with Linguini, the restaurant's new scullery lad, who has zero cooking talent. But by combining the rat's genius in the kitchen with the young man's human-ness (and his ability to be puppet-controlled by having his hair judiciously yanked beneath his toque), they set Paris on its ear and attract the attention of the city's greatest food critic, Anton Ego (the voice of Peter O'Toole).

After a tango with an old lady, Remy is seperated from his family. All hope is lost until the spirit of former master chef Augustus Gusteau (Brad Garrett) helps Remy find his way into a former five-star restaurant, owned by Gusteau no less. There, after getting caught during an attempt to fix a nearly spoiled dinner, he forms a partnership with janitor Linguini (Lou Romano). Remy is able to control the janitor like a marionette, giving the young rat a chance to begin his journey to making himself known about his talents. Just as long as he can avoid being caught by arrogant chef Skinner (Ian Holm), specter-like food critic Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole), and a host of other quirky employees.Once again, Pixar is out to show the other companies who rules the school. Returning from his stint with the surprise 2004 hit ""The Incredibles"", director Brad Bird assumes position for this throwback to classic slapstick cartoons from the Disney vault. It's a little bit of a sketchy mess that overstays its welcome, kind of like ""Cars"", but its breezy pace and a great cast (comprised of comedians and character actors) make it a charming diversion.""Ratatouille"" marks Bird's first foray into animal territory, switching from the humans in Incredibles with rats. There are humans populated in the film that share screen time with the rats. Like I said above, Bird is going for a more madcap tone that calls to mind classic Walt Disney cartoon shorts from the '30s and beyond, and with hilariously caricatured designs of the humans (Gusteau and Skinner score major points thanks to vocal work from Brad Garrett and Ian Holm individually), the director has done his job. Of course, there are life lessons to be heard, but after the disappointing and mawkish ""Meet the Robinsons"", I warmed up a tad more to Ratatouille.Much like ""Incredibles"", ""Ratatouille"" benefits from tight camera work. Even though it isn't set in the real world - as if we didn't know that - the editing makes every dolly and pan feel pretty darn real. Take for example the chase between Remy and Skinner, which somewhat recalls the work of earlier Bond films (a certain secret weapon Bird used in his recent Pixar film). Being it a Pixar film, that's absolutely no surprise.Not all is perfect in France, however. As charming as it is, ""Ratatouille"" gets too big for its britches, adding in some needless subplots, including a tacked-on romance between Linguini and Colette that somehow could've been cut (even if the girl character is sort of an important plot point, and well played by a reliable Janeane Garafolo), and a message from the food critic that becomes another trick from the Heartwarming 101 book. Of course, the film doesn't abandon its wacky tone, rather than get preachy and overtly inspirational.Bird has assembled a good cast here, a talented bunch of comic actors and character actors. Underrated comic Patton Oswalt is a delightful presence who matches the personality of Remy, as well as gaining some milage when sharing the screen with Brian Dennehy's father rat character. Lou Romano is a good charming presence as Linguini, while Ian Holm is a campy delight who makes the scheming Skinner all the more colorful and vivacious. Impressive support also comes from Will Arnett, Peter Sohn, Peter O'Toole, and a bunch others. Too bad John Ratzenberger isn't used to his full potential (same thing happened in ""Cars"").""Ratatouille"" is a delightful film. Though I'm jonesing for the irreverent attitude of ""Surf's Up"" earlier this month, Brad Bird offers a pleasurable enough throwback to screwball cartoons of the past that has enough culinary charm and eye-popping visuals that do a good solid job.

1100459,AUSATFDSU2INS,B000VBJEEG,"milss ""Yellow hair warrior""","[89, 100]","Considering the Disney empire was founded on a mouse, it would be harsh to dismiss Ratatouille simply because it's about a rat as even the most rodent-phobic will be melting for this charming dish.This is Pixar's second collaboration with Disney since it's fusion. And while Ratatouille may lack the pioneering invention and sardonic wit of some of Pixar's previous films, there is plenty to enjoy.Ratatouille has a culinary flavour as it tells the story of Remy, a rat with a passion for cooking. Much of the film is set in the kitchen of Gusteau's, a restaurant so realistically rendered it's possible to almost smell the mouthwatering aromas lingering around.Remy is possessed with a more sophisticated taste than his brother Emile and the rest of his rat colony. He is visited by the ghost of his cooking hero, Gusteau, whose motto is 'Anyone can cook' and encourages Remy to use his catering skills to rescue his restaurant whose reputation has floundered since his passing.Once there, Remy befriends Linguini, the garbage boy. Hiding under Linguini's chef's hat, Remy indicates the talentless boy how to create fabulous dishes, quickly raising both Linguini's and the restaurant's reputation. Ratatouille cleverly explores the restaurant world with its envious rivalries and turbulent kitchen politics. Through stories of jealousy, intrigue, friendship and love, Ratatouille tells us what it takes to overcome a lack of self esteem and to become the person (or rat) you were meant to be.Ratatouille is also filled with other life's lessons. How do you deal with family members who don't see the potential in you? How do you handle people who are emotionally close to you who want you to bend the law for their benefit? Do you become something bigger than you are, or can you achieve the same results by just being honest?Like any good story, this one operates at many levels. Children will love the simplicity of the message, the funny chases, while adults will love the complexity and reality of the relationships. Ratatouille is the name of a simple peasant food that if prepared with care, will rival anything you can serve in the best restaurants of the world. It is also symbolic of our own lives. It may be simple, but if we lead it with care, love and kindness, it will be as good and valuable as the life of the most notorius man in the world.",4,Bon appetit!,1190592000,"09 24, 2007",2007,2357,"['Considering', 'Disney', 'empire', 'was', 'founded', 'mouse', 'would', 'be', 'harsh', 'dismiss', 'Ratatouille', 'simply', 'rat', 'even', 'most', 'rodent-phobic', 'will', 'be', 'melting', 'charming', 'dish.This', 'Pixar', 'second', 'collaboration', 'Disney', 'fusion', 'Ratatouille', 'may', 'lack', 'pioneering', 'invention', 'sardonic', 'wit', 'Pixar', 'previous', 'films', 'plenty', 'enjoy.Ratatouille', 'culinary', 'flavour', 'story', 'Remy', 'rat', 'passion', 'cooking', 'Much', 'film', 'set', 'kitchen', 'Gusteau', 'restaurant', 'so', 'realistically', 'rendered', 'possible', 'almost', 'smell', 'mouthwatering', 'aromas', 'lingering', 'around.Remy', 'possessed', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'taste', 'brother', 'Emile', 'rest', 'rat', 'colony', 'visited', 'ghost', 'cooking', 'hero', 'Gusteau', 'motto', ""'Anyone"", 'can', 'cook', 'encourages', 'Remy', 'use', 'catering', 'skills', 'rescue', 'restaurant', 'reputation', 'floundered', 'passing.Once', 'there', 'Remy', 'Linguini', 'garbage', 'boy', 'Hiding', 'Linguini', 'chef', 'hat', 'Remy', 'talentless', 'boy', 'how', 'create', 'fabulous', 'dishes', 'quickly', 'raising', 'Linguini', 'restaurant', 'reputation', 'Ratatouille', 'cleverly', 'restaurant', 'world', 'envious', 'rivalries', 'turbulent', 'kitchen', 'politics', 'stories', 'jealousy', 'intrigue', 'friendship', 'love', 'Ratatouille', 'what', 'overcome', 'lack', 'self', 'esteem', 'become', 'person', 'rat', 'were', 'meant', 'be.Ratatouille', 'also', 'filled', 'other', 'life', 'lessons', 'How', 'do', 'deal', 'family', 'members', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'potential', 'How', 'do', 'handle', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'emotionally', 'close', 'who', 'want', 'bend', 'law', 'benefit', 'Do', 'become', 'something', 'bigger', 'are', 'can', 'achieve', 'same', 'results', 'just', 'being', 'honest', 'good', 'story', 'one', 'many', 'levels', 'Children', 'will', 'love', 'simplicity', 'message', 'funny', 'chases', 'adults', 'will', 'love', 'complexity', 'reality', 'relationships', 'Ratatouille', 'name', 'simple', 'peasant', 'food', 'prepared', 'care', 'will', 'rival', 'anything', 'can', 'serve', 'best', 'restaurants', 'world', 'also', 'symbolic', 'own', 'lives', 'may', 'be', 'simple', 'lead', 'care', 'love', 'kindness', 'will', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'valuable', 'life', 'most', 'notorius', 'man', 'world']",N/A
1100460,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B000VBJEEG,mirasreviews,"[1, 1]","Writer and director Brad Bird offers a hilarious, generous take on food snobbery in ""Ratatouille"". Remy (Patton Oswalt) is a rat whose discerning palette has earned him the derision of his fellow rodents and the wrath of humans horrified to find a rat plundering their pantries. Fleeing one of his kitchen adventures, Remy lands in Paris, food snob capital of the world and home to Gusteau's, the restaurant of Remy's culinary hero. The restaurant's reputation has dimmed since the great chef's death, and a garbage boy named Linguine (Lou Romano) tampering with the soup doesn't bode well. When Remy intervenes to save the soup, he enables an unprecedented human-rat collaboration that may restore Gusteau's to its former glory -if the Head Chef (Ian Holm) doesn't sabotage his success.The folks at Pixar have rediscovered how to make an animated film to please all ages. ""Ratatouille"" is Pixar's best animated feature since 2001's ""Monsters, Inc."". Adults will find plenty to laugh at, and ""Ratatouille"" doesn't run out of steam in 1 hour and 50 minutes. The filmmakers consulted with chef Thomas Keller and hung out in Parisian restaurants to learn the ways of the professional kitchen. They must have gotten it right, since ""Ratatouille"" has received high praise from French chefs. The film venerates devotion to good food while poking fun at inflexibility. Remy's gastronomic passions delight and entertain. His ambition to be something more than a thieving rat inspires sympathy. And it made me hungry!The DVD (Disney 2007): Bonus features are 3 deleted scenes (15 min), one featurette, and 2 short films. ""Fine Food and Film: A Conversation with Brad Bird and Thomas Keller"" (14 min) interviews the director and the chef about where they get their ideas, spontaneity, their beginnings, how they inspire and collaborate with their staffs, and their goals. ""Lifted"" (5 min) is a short animated film about an apprentice alien whose attempt to abduct a sleeping human meets with some obstacles. ""Your Friend the Rat"" (11 min) is another animated short, hosted by rats Remy and brother Emile. Remy presents the history of the contentious relationship between rats and humans. Emile introduces some rat trivia. Subtitles for the feature are available in English.",5,Vivent les gourmands! Meme les rats. (Long live gourmets!

First off, the detail and clarity of the image is beyond wonderful.  The details are incredibly fine.  The colors are rich and everything is fully stunning.  Add to this, the story is extremely well done.Now, to the features.  People who support HD-DVD will often rag Blu-ray for its lack of Picture-in-Picture (only at the present time, as it is coming).  However, that being said, I haven't seen an HD-DVD release with PiP that matched the complexity of interactivity on this disc.  The option for Cine-Explore allows you to choose the special features you want, but if you pick the automatic feature you are in for a wild ride.  The movie then has the director and prodcer's's commentary track throughout, while flashing photos, drawings, and paintings, and also branch off to special videos (90% I would say are in 1080i or 1080p) about the making of the film, then come back to the exact spot the film left off.  This is no tiny spot in the corner, but rather full-screen videos.  Altogether, these extra videos make the film run about three hours or more.  Magnificently put together, all work seamlessly.  But it is definitely something to watch AFTER you see the film for the first time in regular play.In addition, there are separate featurettes on the making of the film, two Pixar shorts, and the game, which really keeps you busy.  Plus an Easter egg that leads into five short pieces.I highly recommend this as something that could even turn an HD-DVDer into a Blu-ray supporter.

1100471,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,B000VBJEEG,Monty Moonlight,"[8, 8]","Remy is an ordinary rat with extraordinarily acute senses. This leads him to a love of the finer flavors food has to offer, much to the puzzlement of his garbage eating brethren. His father has made him the clan's rat-poison detector, but Remy secretly yearns to become a great chef, and he risks life and limb to learn how by getting dangerously close to the human world. One night, however, things go horribly wrong and the whole group is forced to scatter from the cottage they have been furtively inhabiting. Remy soon finds himself separated from the others, being swept away through the sewer system and coming up under a fine restaurant in the heart of Paris. It's a dream come true for Remy, but when he can't control his urge to tamper with the dishes, he soon finds himself in a deceptive partnership with the hapless new garbage-boy, Alfredo Linguini. With Remy literally under his hat, Linguini quickly becomes the hot new chef in the city of light! But his boss, head chef Skinner, smells a rat, and the famed food critic Anton Ego poses no less a danger; not to mention the health inspector!To the Disney animation fan, ""Ratatouille"" may evoke memories of a cartoon short called ""Ben and Me,"" or even the classic story of Cyrano de Bergerac. But, don't sell this film short based on that. It's full of originality, heart, fun, excitement, and charm! Heavy on the Euro-atmosphere, and appropriately so, ""Ratatouille"" dives deep into the world of the culinary arts, making it a perfect film for an age when Emeril Lagasse and Rachael Ray are household names and shows like ""Iron Chef"" are hot stuff! Patton Oswalt is the star of the show as the perfect voice for the endearing Remy the rat, whose desire to be a great chef fuels his hope for a world where humans and rats can live together with mutual respect. The entire film is a feast for the senses in itself, as one always expects from PIXAR, and I definitely would call it several steps up from their last offering, ""Cars,"" which I found to be enjoyable, but not quite up to expectations (storywise). ""Ratatouille,"" on the other hand, is fairly unpredictable, smart, and thoroughly enjoyable, and, in my opinion, among PIXAR's best stuff. Director Brad Bird's animation track record remains excellent!Also worth mentioning is the deeper level to the film's story that may click with animation fans if they dare to take a closer look. ""Ratatouille"" could almost be called PIXAR's autobiography, telling the story of how a little studio that was bringing something new to the table had to stand on the shoulders of a giant and struggle to earn respect and a following amidst doubting peers, patrons, and critics. Deceased master chef Gusteau is clearly a take on the great Walt Disney himself, with his restaurant representing the Disney Studios trying to keep the magic going without him (and sticking to his proven recipes). Of course, looking at the film in that light puts an entirely different spin on it and opens the gates to all sorts of fascinating ideas as to just what PIXAR is saying about whom.This thankfully widescreen DVD edition, unfortunately, is less than worthy of the masterpiece it holds. Probably in an effort to encourage upgrading to Blu-Ray, but perhaps for other reasons, PIXAR has really gone downhill in the extras department. There are some sweet ones, but so few in comparison to previous releases, particularly those two-discers that came out prior to the ""Cars"" DVD. All this edition offers are 3 deleted scenes (though nicely put together), 2 Easter Eggs, a featurette where director Brad Bird and chef Thomas Keller talk about their passions for their work, and the highlights, two original animated shorts. The first short is ""Lifted,"" the theatrical short that was shown with ""Ratatouille."" This is a cute, physical comedy short about an alien abductor in training who is having trouble beaming up his sleeping victim. The second one I found HIGHLY enjoyable. It's called, ""Your Friend the Rat,"" and is a hilarious lesson in rat-history hosted by Remy and his brother, Emile. What makes this particularly enjoyable is how its random art styles hark back to the days of Ludwig Von Drake and shorts like, ""It's Tough to be a Bird."" A wonderful treat for the fan of classic Disney animation, and a fine compliment to another outstanding PIXAR feature achievement.",5,A Delicious Viewing Experience!,1194307200,"11 6, 2007",2007,4363,"['Remy', 'ordinary', 'rat', 'extraordinarily', 'acute', 'senses', 'love', 'finer', 'flavors', 'food', 'offer', 'much', 'puzzlement', 'garbage', 'eating', 'brethren', 'father', 'made', 'clan', 'rat-poison', 'detector', 'Remy', 'secretly', 'become', 'great', 'chef', 'life', 'limb', 'learn', 'how', 'getting', 'dangerously', 'close', 'human', 'world', 'One', 'night', 'however', 'things', 'go', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'whole', 'group', 'forced', 'scatter', 'cottage', 'have', 'been', 'furtively', 'inhabiting', 'Remy', 'soon', 'separated', 'others', 'being', 'swept', 'away', 'sewer', 'system', 'coming', 'up', 'fine', 'restaurant', 'heart', 'Paris', 'dream', 'come', 'true', 'Remy', 'when', 'ca', ""n't"", 'control', 'urge', 'tamper', 'dishes', 'soon', 'deceptive', 'partnership', 'hapless', 'new', 'garbage-boy', 'Alfredo', 'Linguini', 'Remy', 'literally', 'hat', 'Linguini', 'quickly', 'hot', 'new', 'chef', 'city', 'light', 'boss', 'head', 'chef', 'Skinner', 'rat', 'famed', 'food', 'critic', 'Anton', 'Ego', 'less', 'danger', 'not', 'mention', 'health', 'inspector', 'Disney', 'animation', 'fan', 'Ratatouille', 'may', 'evoke', 'memories', 'cartoon', 'short', 'called', 'Ben', 'Me', 'even', 'classic', 'story', 'Cyrano', 'de', 'Bergerac', 'do', ""n't"", 'sell', 'film', 'short', 'based', 'full', 'originality', 'heart', 'fun', 'excitement', 'charm', 'Heavy', 'Euro-atmosphere', 'appropriately', 'so', 'Ratatouille', 'deep', 'world', 'culinary', 'arts', 'making', 'perfect', 'film', 'age', 'when', 'Emeril', 'Lagasse', 'Rachael', 'Ray', 'are', 'household', 'names', 'shows', 'Iron', 'Chef', 'are', 'hot', 'stuff', 'Patton', 'Oswalt', 'star', 'show', 'perfect', 'voice', 'endearing', 'Remy', 'rat', 'desire', 'be', 'great', 'chef', 'fuels', 'hope', 'world', 'where', 'humans', 'rats', 'can', 'live', 'together', 'mutual', 'respect', 'entire', 'film', 'feast', 'senses', 'one', 'always', 'PIXAR', 'definitely', 'would', 'call', 'several', 'steps', 'up', 'last', 'offering', 'Cars', 'found', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'not', 'quite', 'expectations', 'storywise', 'Ratatouille', 'other', 'hand', 'fairly', 'unpredictable', 'smart', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'opinion', 'PIXAR', 'best', 'stuff', 'Director', 'Brad', 'Bird', 'animation', 'track', 'record', 'excellent', 'Also', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'deeper', 'level', 'film', 'story', 'may', 'click', 'animation', 'fans', 'dare', 'take', 'closer', 'look', 'Ratatouille', 'could', 'almost', 'be', 'called', 'PIXAR', 'autobiography', 'telling', 'story', 'how', 'little', 'studio', 'was', 'bringing', 'something', 'new', 'table', 'had', 'stand', 'shoulders', 'giant', 'struggle', 'earn', 'respect', 'following', 'amidst', 'doubting', 'peers', 'patrons', 'critics', 'Deceased', 'master', 'chef', 'Gusteau', 'clearly', 'take', 'great', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'restaurant', 'representing', 'Disney', 'Studios', 'trying', 'keep', 'magic', 'going', 'sticking', 'proven', 'recipes', 'course', 'looking', 'film', 'light', 'entirely', 'different', 'spin', 'gates', 'sorts', 'fascinating', 'ideas', 'just', 'what', 'PIXAR', 'saying', 'whom.This', 'thankfully', 'widescreen', 'DVD', 'edition', 'unfortunately', 'less', 'worthy', 'masterpiece', 'Probably', 'effort', 'encourage', 'upgrading', 'Blu-Ray', 'perhaps', 'other', 'reasons', 'PIXAR', 'really', 'gone', 'downhill', 'extras', 'department', 'are', 'sweet', 'ones', 'so', 'few', 'comparison', 'previous', 'releases', 'particularly', 'two-discers', 'came', 'out', 'prior', 'Cars', 'DVD', 'edition', 'offers', 'are', '3', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'nicely', 'put', 'together', '2', 'Easter', 'Eggs', 'featurette', 'where', 'director', 'Brad', 'Bird', 'chef', 'Thomas', 'Keller', 'talk', 'passions', 'work', 'highlights', 'two', 'original', 'animated', 'shorts', 'first', 'short', 'Lifted', 'theatrical', 'short', 'was', 'shown', 'Ratatouille', 'cute', 'physical', 'comedy', 'short', 'alien', 'abductor', 'training', 'who', 'having', 'trouble', 'beaming', 'up', 'sleeping', 'victim', 'second', 'one', 'found', 'HIGHLY', 'enjoyable', 'called', 'Friend', 'Rat', 'hilarious', 'lesson', 'rat-history', 'hosted', 'Remy', 'brother', 'Emile', 'What', 'particularly', 'enjoyable', 'how', 'random', 'art', 'styles', 'hark', 'back', 'days', 'Ludwig', 'Von', 'Drake', 'shorts', 'Tough', 'be', 'Bird', 'wonderful', 'treat', 'fan', 'classic', 'Disney', 'animation', 'fine', 'compliment', 'outstanding', 'PIXAR', 'feature', 'achievement']",N/A
1100472,A20OMCGB73X5LV,B000VBJEEG,Moon Donkey,"[5, 56]","I found this film terribly lame.  I think my kids got a mild degree of enjoyment out of it... but they have never asked to watch it again.This movie is about a rat that cooks.  His fellow rats don't appreciate him, so he goes off to practice his art on his own.  Along the way he meets a boy and helps the boy cook.  The climax comes when the rat cooks a dish for a food critic and the critic enjoys it.Are you asleep yet?  The arch enemy is what?  A food critic.  Uhhhh...I suppose that the redeeming message of this film is supposed to be something like  - ""follow your dreams"".  Maybe the message is ""follow your heart"" or ""do what you love.""  You know, the basic idea is that you should believe in yourself and you will succeed in the end.Yeah right - and maybe you should go to college and get an undergrad degree in art, philosophy, psychology, history, or one of the many other worthless degree programs.  You can also follow your heart to the kitchen, where you will be doing dishes and taking out the garbage.Why are there so many worthless degrees you ask?  (yes, I can hear you thinking - I'm psychic).  Because the government subsidizes it with federal loans.  Before all the government student lending, a college degree actually meant something.  Some unwise politicians decided that hey, wouldn't it be great to give that opportunity to everyone?  Except the problem is that once everyone has the opportunity, it is no longer an opportunity - it is an expectation.  A college degree went from being something extra to something required.  Yes, the government helps fund the education, but now you NEED the education - and the debt to go along with it.  What else happens when the government funds it?  The price of tuition goes up.  Of course it does... the government is paying for it.  Then the colleges, with all this extra money, expand into offering worthless degree programs and paying teachers to do ""research"" while TA's teach the classes.So what does this get you my friend?  More debt for more school for a degree that is as valuable as toilet paper.What the heck does this have to do with Ratatouille you ask?  (I told you I was psychic).  Ratatouille is a crime against our youth.  It says - hey kid, you might be rat, but guess what?  You just go on being a rat and stick to your dreams because some day you will go off to the big kitchen college in the city and cook your masterpiece.  You will get the girl and your friends will all realize they are wrong and see what a smart rat you were.In reality, the kid is going to follow his dreams to college to get a political science degree and then realize that you can't actually get a job doing that.  His friends will continue to think he is a loser.  So will his wife or girlfriend, who will probably dump him for a dude with more money - or at least a nice car.  The guy will live out his days selling sunglasses at a kiosk in the shopping mall.

I did not want to buy it before seeing it, so I rented it from Netflix and loved it. The fact it is a Pixar movie made that easy to understand as I had already enjoyed Finding Nemo which made the talking fish seem believable with very expressive faces. Ratatouille followed suit with mobile faces and very expressive eyes, and a story of a young rat named Remy who didn't want to grow up eating garbage. His way out was a restaurant in Paris that had once been rated five stars but lost two due to a bad review, and the death of its head chef. Enter Remy and an ambitious garbage boy named Alfredo Linguini who can't cook, but wants to. With Remy controlling Linguini, they make magic in the kitchen and win over the customers. Now they have to win over the very critic who had cost the restaurant one of its five stars with his bad review.

I feel that that previous story lines have been weak. Even though Pixar's movies have always been somewhat entertaining, they've never reached the the level of classic Disney animation and storytelling. However, with Ratatouille, I saw a story that begins to rival classic Disney movies such as Dumbo and Pinocchio.Ratatouille is directed by, Academy Award(tm)-winning director Brad Bird (The IncrediblesGet 5 DVDs for 49 cents each with membership!) it is the ultimate tale of finding discovering and being true to yourself.Despite his family's objections Remy, the rat, sets out of fulfill his dream of becoming a chef and enjoying the finer things in life. His dreams seem to be within reach when he ends up living beneath the restaurant of his culinary hero, Augusted Gusteau. Remy quickly forms a bond with Linguini, the garbage boy. Without revealing too much Remy and Linguini's adventures turn the Paris food scene upside down.In true Disney/Pixar storytelling Remy learns about friendship, family and to be true to oneself.The computer animation from Pixar is once again simply amazing. It seems that with every film Pixar takes computer animation to a new level (including a new cg effect called squashy and stretchy). I wouldn't be surprise if this cg effect was used in more Pixar films. Pixar has always paid attention to detail, and this time they really did their homework. The city of Paris has never looked so beautiful on the silver screen and the 3D food makes your mouth water and your stomach growl.Ratatouille is definitely a movie for all ages, and is as touching and moving as any Pixar picture movie has ever been (this reviewer even got a little choked up and teary eyed by the film ending sceneHidden Mickey AlertBe sure not to keep an eye out for the hidden Mickey.

Whether it be Mouse Hunt, Stuart Little, or the various Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny cartoons, they range from average to good, with an occasional cult classic like Mouse Hunt.  Then Pixar came along with this full-length feature, Ratatouille.  Packing romance, comedy and a little suspense into the streets of Paris with a prologue in the French countryside, this is my favorite movie by Pixar so far.  Several strands of the movie pick up from previous Pixar releases, the key one being the dual male leads, Remy and Linguini, which is found in Monsters Inc, Cars, Toy Story, and Up.  Another feature shared with previous Pixar films is the seamless and flawless interactions between the human characters and the non-human ones.  In this case, the relationship between the rats and people as shown in this movie look so real and logical, with perfect animation of facial expressions and movements.Now to the package.  Like other Disney releases, we get a Blu-ray and DVD containing identical features; the film, deleted scenes, the Pixar short, and the extra film that comes only with the package.  In this case, the latter is a ""documentary"" narrated by Remy about the relationship between rats and people over the years.  This extra film is actually funnier than the Pixar short and the feature film itself.  The deleted scenes are all partially animated, and nothing noteworthy to speak of.

1100493,AHF97M45JFCB,B000VBJEEG,ONENEO,"[1, 1]","I might as well come right out with it:  Any attempts to discount Pixar's absolute mastery of the craft of computer animated features are absolutely futile from this critic from this moment forward.  Until now I've been pretty consistent in giving their ballyhooed works 4-star ratings due to the sheer cleverness of their plots and the attention to detail of their visual prowess (sometimes even tainted in protest by Disney's habit of over-promoting) but 2007's Ratatouille has managed to so thoroughly touch upon every single element of what makes a classic film that it nearly single-handedly atones for every set of Toy Story bed sheets or Finding Nemo lunchboxes bartered the world over.Well I suppose as is customary, I should begin this review with a short synopsis of the story with one caveat: Ratatouille really doesn't lend itself to summation.  I knew this going in when all of the pre-purchase research I did led to the same shaky conclusion: Really, a tale about a cooking rat in France?  Never mind all that! This is to French rat chefs what Wall-E is to your trash compactor or what Monsters Inc is to applying for a job at the electric company.  In other words, Pixar takes a fairly mundane concept and packs it so chock full of charm and personality that we would be captivated just looking at an animated lamp.  Oh wait, they've proven that already but I digress.Ratatouille centers on the tale of Remy, a gray rat gifted with a sense of smell. With aspirations of using his talents to concoct gourmet dishes, he is instead given the most un-romantic task of sniffing out rat poison for his rodent colony.When his family is forced to abandon their home in the walls of a cottage in the French countryside, Remy is separated from his brood and ends up in the sewers of Paris. In hunger and desperation, Remy has a hallucination of his lifelong idol, the recently deceased chef Auguste Gusteau. Following Gusteau's advice, Remy finds himself at the skylight overlooking the kitchen of Gusteau's world famous restaurant.  By fate, destiny or just good fortune, the wheels are in motion to put Remy in a position to showcase his repressed talents.Well if after having read all this, the plot sounds awesome to you, congratulations.  You are already ahead of where I was going in.  I really couldn't imagine a full-length animated feature film (and one at 111-minutes at that) about said topic being terribly intriguing and yet I was pleasantly surprised almost immediately.Like most Pixar pieces the exact source of the charm isn't even easily identified.  There is abundant attention to visual and textural detail on a near frame per frame basis, the voice acting is spot on and the character animations are, well, pure Pixar and yet even still I can't help but profess a certain degree of subtle wit and faultless timing that never allows the viewer to forget this is a high class Disney venture through and through.Pacing is downright spectacular with just enough character building and story-setting to establish the tone of what's to come.  The action wastes little time revealing itself and is remarkably satisfying throughout the multiple incarnations contained within.The scoring is Michael Giacchino, which, suffice to say, is downright spectacular with beautiful soaring compositions and personal mood-setters scattered throughout.In all it's difficult to adequately isolate just what it is that makes Ratatouille so wondrous.  I like to think that, like all of Brad Bird's works, there isn't a single factor that outshines the others so much as it's the culmination of years of lessons learned both in 2D and 3D animation mediums.The script contains the type of polish and fineness that comes only with years of tweaking and rewriting.  Scenes flow with deliberate prose, sequences form with near-poetic resolve, and the grand story arc is seamless in its delivery.About the only thing I can say that even resembles a complaint about this work is the simple reality that of all the Pixar pieces, a strong argument could be made that this one is the most adult-oriented of the lot.  Not that kids won't marvel at the bright colors, cute characters, and general onscreen action, it seems much of the subtleties, humor, pacing and gourmet food integration will certainly be better appreciated by the older set.In all I'm quite proud to finally slap a perfect 5-star rating on a Disney/ Pixar property.  This one finally delivers, for me anyway; the potential hinted upon in every Pixar film prior and since and does so with style, grace and humor.  Director Brad Bird concludes his interview on the disc by saying that he loves the medium of computer animation and that fact's apparent here from beginning to end.",5,Perhaps Pixar's Finest Work To Date,1296864000,"02 5, 2011",2011,4737,"['might', 'as', 'well', 'come', 'right', 'out', 'attempts', 'discount', 'Pixar', 'absolute', 'mastery', 'craft', 'computer', 'animated', 'features', 'are', 'absolutely', 'futile', 'critic', 'moment', 'forward', 'now', ""'ve"", 'been', 'pretty', 'consistent', 'giving', 'ballyhooed', '4-star', 'ratings', 'due', 'sheer', 'cleverness', 'plots', 'attention', 'detail', 'visual', 'prowess', 'sometimes', 'even', 'tainted', 'protest', 'Disney', 'habit', 'over-promoting', '2007', 'Ratatouille', 'managed', 'so', 'thoroughly', 'touch', 'single', 'element', 'what', 'classic', 'film', 'nearly', 'single-handedly', 'atones', 'set', 'Toy', 'Story', 'bed', 'sheets', 'Finding', 'Nemo', 'lunchboxes', 'bartered', 'world', 'over.Well', 'suppose', 'customary', 'should', 'begin', 'review', 'short', 'synopsis', 'story', 'one', 'caveat', 'Ratatouille', 'really', ""n't"", 'lend', 'summation', 'knew', 'going', 'when', 'pre-purchase', 'research', 'did', 'led', 'same', 'shaky', 'conclusion', 'Really', 'tale', 'cooking', 'rat', 'France', 'Never', 'mind', 'French', 'rat', 'chefs', 'what', 'Wall-E', 'trash', 'compactor', 'what', 'Monsters', 'Inc', 'applying', 'job', 'electric', 'company', 'other', 'words', 'Pixar', 'fairly', 'mundane', 'concept', 'packs', 'so', 'chock', 'full', 'charm', 'personality', 'would', 'be', 'captivated', 'just', 'looking', 'animated', 'lamp', 'Oh', 'wait', ""'ve"", 'proven', 'already', 'digress.Ratatouille', 'centers', 'tale', 'Remy', 'gray', 'rat', 'gifted', 'sense', 'smell', 'aspirations', 'using', 'talents', 'concoct', 'gourmet', 'dishes', 'instead', 'given', 'most', 'un-romantic', 'task', 'sniffing', 'out', 'rat', 'poison', 'rodent', 'colony.When', 'family', 'forced', 'abandon', 'home', 'walls', 'cottage', 'French', 'countryside', 'Remy', 'separated', 'brood', 'up', 'sewers', 'Paris', 'hunger', 'desperation', 'Remy', 'hallucination', 'lifelong', 'idol', 'recently', 'deceased', 'chef', 'Auguste', 'Gusteau', 'Following', 'Gusteau', 'advice', 'Remy', 'skylight', 'overlooking', 'kitchen', 'Gusteau', 'world', 'famous', 'restaurant', 'fate', 'destiny', 'just', 'good', 'fortune', 'wheels', 'are', 'motion', 'put', 'Remy', 'position', 'showcase', 'repressed', 'talents.Well', 'having', 'read', 'plot', 'awesome', 'congratulations', 'are', 'already', 'ahead', 'where', 'was', 'going', 'really', 'could', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'full-length', 'animated', 'feature', 'film', 'one', '111-minutes', 'said', 'topic', 'being', 'terribly', 'intriguing', 'yet', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'almost', 'most', 'Pixar', 'exact', 'source', 'charm', ""n't"", 'even', 'easily', 'identified', 'abundant', 'attention', 'visual', 'textural', 'detail', 'near', 'frame', 'frame', 'basis', 'voice', 'acting', 'spot', 'character', 'animations', 'are', 'well', 'pure', 'Pixar', 'yet', 'even', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'profess', 'certain', 'degree', 'subtle', 'wit', 'faultless', 'timing', 'never', 'viewer', 'forget', 'high', 'class', 'Disney', 'venture', 'through.Pacing', 'downright', 'spectacular', 'just', 'enough', 'character', 'building', 'story-setting', 'establish', 'tone', 'what', 'come', 'action', 'little', 'time', 'revealing', 'remarkably', 'satisfying', 'multiple', 'incarnations', 'contained', 'within.The', 'scoring', 'Michael', 'Giacchino', 'suffice', 'say', 'downright', 'spectacular', 'beautiful', 'soaring', 'compositions', 'personal', 'mood-setters', 'scattered', 'difficult', 'adequately', 'isolate', 'just', 'what', 'Ratatouille', 'so', 'wondrous', 'like', 'think', 'Brad', 'Bird', 'works', ""n't"", 'single', 'factor', 'others', 'so', 'much', 'culmination', 'years', 'lessons', 'learned', '2D', '3D', 'animation', 'mediums.The', 'script', 'type', 'polish', 'fineness', 'only', 'years', 'tweaking', 'rewriting', 'Scenes', 'flow', 'deliberate', 'prose', 'sequences', 'form', 'near-poetic', 'resolve', 'grand', 'story', 'arc', 'seamless', 'delivery.About', 'only', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'even', 'complaint', 'work', 'simple', 'reality', 'Pixar', 'pieces', 'strong', 'argument', 'could', 'be', 'made', 'one', 'most', 'adult-oriented', 'lot', 'Not', 'kids', 'wo', ""n't"", 'marvel', 'bright', 'colors', 'cute', 'characters', 'general', 'onscreen', 'action', 'much', 'subtleties', 'humor', 'pacing', 'gourmet', 'food', 'integration', 'will', 'certainly', 'be', 'better', 'appreciated', 'older', 'set.In', ""'m"", 'quite', 'proud', 'finally', 'slap', 'perfect', '5-star', 'rating', 'Disney/', 'Pixar', 'property', 'one', 'finally', 'delivers', 'anyway', 'potential', 'hinted', 'Pixar', 'film', 'prior', 'so', 'style', 'grace', 'humor', 'Director', 'Brad', 'Bird', 'interview', 'disc', 'saying', 'medium', 'computer', 'animation', 'fact', 'apparent', 'here', 'beginning', 'end']",N/A

1100505,A2E3IB2ZHJ7QXJ,B000VBJEEG,Private Quentin Tarantino Fan,"[1, 1]","Ratatouille, the second Pixar movie to be directed by Brad Bird, is some serious gourmet ______.  Allow me to go into reviewing this fine movie without having to resort to a cheesy intro filled with terrible puns related to food (nice cliched intro, eh?).Ratatouille's message is pretty simple, but like other Pixar works, they never turn into a preach-fest (which is something all movies should never do), serving up a mix of humor, some action, and people actually doing interesting things instead of just sitting around and talking.  Few things are more entertaining in the Pixar canon than watching a rat (which is somehow cute, but that's because animals are naturally cuter than humans because they are the ______) cook gourmet soup.  However,Pixar is not often known for elaborate witty humor, as some of the slapstick in this movie is not my type of humor (yeah, my humor includes movies like Pulp Fiction and Dead Alive).  Thankfully, there is not a lot of childish slapstick, and even some of the slapstick scenes are kind of funny. And there is some sharp dialogue thrown in there (""Now shut up and eat your garbage"".  ""Don't be so modest your a rat for pete's sake"" etc)I do however, think the Collete and Linguini relationship was just thrown in there to make the movie seem more intimate, but that is pretty much kept to a minimum.Of course, Pixar also is able to create a cast of characters that makes the entertaining parts actually entertaining, and characters you actually give a damn about.  The rat colony and family, the short, leering antagonist, and a colorful set of kitchen cooks (with one that has done time, no less)  And of course, an animated rat is proved to be likeable.  My favorite character is Anton Ego, the powerful food critic (actually pretty dead on description of critics) whom everyone fears, a leering intimidating man, but ultimately a bit good natured and actually humane (and no, he is NOT evil.  Watch the flashback you idiots).As usual, the animation is top notch.  Thanks to the flawless animation and an imagination, Pixar was able to recreate a fantasty version of Paris, somewhat romanticized, but brilliant nonetheless.  Remy's overhead look of Paris is dazzling, as well as the lush, homey country at the beggining of the movie.  Furthermore, it's got enough variety into the imagined version of Paris that's it's extremely believable and not just some choked up romantic version of Paris that exists in everyone dreams (which is somewhat true, but Paris obviously has plenty of bad areas with an abscence of lights).  There's plenty of grit and grime of a real city, which is pleasing to know so, and feels very Paris in the grit and grime way.  Also worth noting is the challenged they overcame by making the actual computer generated food look somewhat delicious, and it kind of does.  Everything else is wonderfully detailed as usual, from the water, rain, to the fantastically designed interiors (!).Voice casting?  Ratatouille doesn't have as many big names as Cars did (the number of special people on that movie were insane!), but I'm not quite sure if Peter O' Toole's voice isn't smaller than any of them.  Come on, this was the guy that was in Lawrence of Arabia and Caligula (Yeah, why the ________ am I namedropping a pornographic movie in a review for a family film) But O' Toole or not, the other cast memembers are no slouches either.  Other big names in the adult movie world include Ian Holm, who was in Alien and Brazil, as well as Lord of the Rings.Is Ratatouille the best Pixar movie?  No, but it's definitely up there.  And to think that a movie studio that made such a milestone like Toy Story is still releasing movies that are still pushing the envelope in what they are doing with computer animation and storytelling (maybe not storytelling since not every plot they do is that interesting to me, such as WALL-E).Oh, and one other thing.

The ability the folks at Pixar have to simulate water, hair, fur, mushrooms, flame, raspberry syrup, and mayhem continue to astound me. They can also tell a good story with some surprisingly honest turns.Be warned, this is not a film for small children. My seven year old son found a scene displaying several trapped, dead rats to be very disturbing. As a matter of fact, I found the scene disturbing too. A bit too much. Too much like coming around the bend in the fog at the concentration camp in the film ""Life is Beautiful"" on that pile of emaciated. . . okay. We won't go there.But the film was amazing. It felt like a real movie. Sometimes I forgot I was watching a cartoon. Some of the ideas were hard for me to choke down, like the rat's method for directing the garbage boy's cooking. But overall the film had a very classy feel, perhaps due to all those gorgeous panoramas of Paris at night.I think the exposition needed a little more thought.  It was too long, and it felt contrived.  But just hang in there because once the film gets going, all is forgiven.This is the best ""misunderstood artist"" film I have ever seen.  There is a nay-saying father character who wants his son to keep away from humans and stop trying to be a chef.  But then, when dad realizes how much this dream means to his boy, he rallies the whole family to help him achieve it!  In too many of these ""misunderstood artist"" stories, the family authority figure is seen as nothing more than an obstacle.  In this story the theme is: let your family in on your dreams and they will help you achieve them!My favorite part of the film was the critique of critics delivered by the intimidating Anton Ego near the end. Critics, so he writes, thrive on negativism. Their writings are less valuable than the garbage that they so label as garbage. He claims, however, that critics can do some good if they discover something great and lead the public to partake of it.I would say critics have another valuable role. They can make suggestions on the subject of what to do better next time. They can advise the artist as to what did and what didn't work.

Woody and Buzz, even the little game-machine alien, were just as evocative as any big-name actor--and a lot more fun.What I especially like about Pixar is they really do push the envelope. Think about it, they've made us come to care for bugs--and now a rat.  That's no mean feat.  I suspect Pixar's amazing talent could make a dungbeetle's antics hilarious and oddly appealing.The story in brief, Remy (Patton Oswalt's voice) is a rat with taste. He's watched a lot of cooking shows featuring his favorite, Chef Gusteau and he's even learned to read Gusteau's book, ""Anyone Can Cook."" He's hiding this information from his father, who has a different opinion.Remy gets tragically separated from his family colony and begins to see the ghost of Chef Gusteau (Brad Garrett's voice) and the Chef gives him some very good advice:""If you're focused on what you've left behind, you will not be able to see what lies ahead. Now go up and look around!""Remy discovers he's in Paris, home of the best food in the world--at least, according to Parisians. And he's very close to Gusteau's restaurant.Surreptitiously, he enters the restaurant to find there's a new garbage boy, Linguini (Lou Romano's voice) spoiling the soup.  Remy cannot help but 'fix' the problem.  The soup's a hit and Linguini's got a promotion, the problem is Linguini really can't cook.So, Linguini and Remy team up.  Their communication and antics are hilarious.  Only the way, we encounter a hardbitten critic's critic, Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole's voice) who ruined Gusteau's restaurant in the first place and indirectly caused his demise, Skinner (Ian Holm's voice) who now presides over the kitchen of Gusteau's and hopes to inherit the empire.The story's fun, and for the most part, predictable.

1100526,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000VBJEEG,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 4]","Ratatouille (Brad Bird, 2007)In 1994, Pixar shot to the top of the American heap of animators with Toy Story. At the same time, the similarly placed giant of the Japanese animation industry, Studio Ghibli, started gaining American converts; a few years later, critics saw Princess Mononoke and realized that there might be something to this guy Hayao Miyazaki's directorial skills after all. Then came 2001, and each studio released its (to date) magnum opus; Pixar treated us to Monsters, Inc., while Ghibli unleashed Spirited Away, both of which are widely considered to be among the thousand or so finest movies ever made. There, their paths diverged. Ghibli, never known for being a factory, has released only a single movie since (Howl's Moving Castle), with its second in the period since slated for release in 2008. Pixar, on the other hand, who had previously followed a somewhat similar release schedule, started plowing them out like gangbusters. Pixar have released, on average, one full-length movie per year since 2003. Some studios can do that and not sacrifice the quality inherent in their previous stock. Pixar, as it turns out, was not one of them. Whereas Toy Story (and its sequel) and Monsters, Inc. are fantastic movies for all ages of viewer, the post-2001 material has become increasingly kid-centric. Not that this is necessarily a bad thing if your target audience is kids. But, as the makers of any number of kids'-movie flops in recent years (with 2006 a nadir) will lament, what does it matter if your target audience (a) can't drive and (b) has parents who cower in terror at the thought of seeing whatever it kids the kids are so all-fired excited about? The lowest point, for Pixar, came with last year's Cars; the only person I know who actually likes the movie was three years old when it came out.I don't know whether someone at Pixar realized that Ghibli was pulling away with amazing speed in the animation wars, or whether cooler heads finally prevailed, but Ratatouille is a long-awaited return to form--a Pixar movie that will enchant both kids and adults alike. Well, except for those who don't like rats. The story focuses on Remy (The King of Queens' Patton Oswalt), a highly intelligent rat who's obsessed with cooking. Through a series of misadventures, Remy hooks up with Linguini (Pixar regular Lou Romano), a janitor at the restaurant of the chef Remy idolizes, and Remy finds his opportunity to become a world-class chef with Linguini acting as his hands. A simple plot, as in the best Pixar movies, rapidly spirals out of control into something Corinthian in its complexity, while the visuals provide a feast of amusing details that show there's a brilliant mind at work behind the controls. Bird, responsible for the decent-but-nothing-special The Incredibles a few years ago, finally lives up to the promise he showed with The Iron Giant. This is the kind of stuff Pixar is capable of putting out when it brings it's a game, and it's wonderful to see Pixar bringing it's a game again. ****",4,"Welcome back, Pixar!",1183593600,"07 5, 2007",2007,3041,"['Ratatouille', 'Brad', 'Bird', '2007', '1994', 'Pixar', 'shot', 'top', 'American', 'heap', 'animators', 'Toy', 'Story', 'same', 'time', 'similarly', 'placed', 'giant', 'Japanese', 'animation', 'industry', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'started', 'gaining', 'American', 'converts', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'critics', 'saw', 'Princess', 'Mononoke', 'realized', 'might', 'be', 'something', 'guy', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'directorial', 'skills', 'Then', 'came', '2001', 'studio', 'released', 'date', 'magnum', 'opus', 'Pixar', 'treated', 'Monsters', 'Inc.', 'Ghibli', 'unleashed', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'are', 'widely', 'considered', 'be', 'thousand', 'so', 'finest', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'paths', 'diverged', 'Ghibli', 'never', 'known', 'being', 'factory', 'released', 'only', 'single', 'movie', 'Howl', 'Moving', 'Castle', 'second', 'period', 'slated', 'release', '2008', 'Pixar', 'other', 'hand', 'who', 'had', 'previously', 'followed', 'somewhat', 'similar', 'release', 'schedule', 'started', 'plowing', 'gangbusters', 'Pixar', 'have', 'released', 'average', 'one', 'full-length', 'movie', 'year', '2003', 'studios', 'can', 'do', 'not', 'sacrifice', 'quality', 'inherent', 'previous', 'stock', 'Pixar', 'out', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'Whereas', 'Toy', 'Story', 'sequel', 'Monsters', 'Inc.', 'are', 'fantastic', 'movies', 'ages', 'viewer', 'post-2001', 'material', 'become', 'increasingly', 'kid-centric', 'Not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'target', 'audience', 'kids', 'makers', 'number', ""kids'-movie"", 'flops', 'recent', 'years', '2006', 'nadir', 'will', 'lament', 'what', 'matter', 'target', 'audience', 'ca', ""n't"", 'drive', 'b', 'parents', 'who', 'cower', 'terror', 'thought', 'seeing', 'kids', 'are', 'so', 'all-fired', 'excited', 'lowest', 'point', 'Pixar', 'came', 'last', 'year', 'Cars', 'only', 'person', 'know', 'who', 'actually', 'movie', 'was', 'three', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'came', 'out.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'someone', 'Pixar', 'realized', 'Ghibli', 'was', 'pulling', 'away', 'amazing', 'speed', 'animation', 'wars', 'cooler', 'heads', 'finally', 'prevailed', 'Ratatouille', 'long-awaited', 'return', 'form', 'Pixar', 'movie', 'will', 'enchant', 'kids', 'adults', 'alike', 'Well', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'rats', 'story', 'Remy', 'King', 'Queens', 'Patton', 'Oswalt', 'highly', 'intelligent', 'rat', 'who', 'obsessed', 'cooking', 'series', 'misadventures', 'Remy', 'up', 'Linguini', 'Pixar', 'regular', 'Lou', 'Romano', 'janitor', 'restaurant', 'chef', 'Remy', 'Remy', 'opportunity', 'become', 'world-class', 'chef', 'Linguini', 'acting', 'hands', 'simple', 'plot', 'best', 'Pixar', 'movies', 'rapidly', 'control', 'something', 'Corinthian', 'complexity', 'visuals', 'provide', 'feast', 'amusing', 'details', 'show', 'brilliant', 'mind', 'work', 'controls', 'Bird', 'responsible', 'decent-but-nothing-special', 'Incredibles', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'finally', 'up', 'promise', 'showed', 'Iron', 'Giant', 'kind', 'stuff', 'Pixar', 'capable', 'putting', 'out', 'when', 'game', 'wonderful', 'see', 'Pixar', 'bringing', 'game', 'again', '****']",N/A
1100527,A277MYG7MQTKYW,B000VBJEEG,Robert Blenheim,"[3, 3]","Possibly the 2007 film that is closest to perfection is Pixar's ""Ratatouille"", an animated comedy that seems to focus on the story of a rat named Remy who has a sense of smell and a great talent for the culinary arts, and who becomes a secret chef at a French restaurant, managing to be a hit to the gourmets who don't know their chef is a rodent.But something magical happens about half way through: The focus switches more to the story of the scullery kitchen lad and his fellow kitchen superiors (including the dominating Colette, voiced by Janeane Garofalo) and we realize that the human animal was really the film's main subject all along. Its visual look is like great French paintings and its animation state-of-the-art, thanks to directors Brad Bird and Jan Pinkava, all set off by a wonderful music score that breathes life, love and Paris in every bar. Amazingly, the film's poetic setting contrasting the Parisian slums (the world of the rats) with the high-class restaurant for connoisseurs reminds one of the best of Ernst Lubitsch (like the romantic setting of the garbage scow in his 1932 ""Trouble in Paradise""), but it is Lubitsch as if some Preston Sturges slapstick had wandered into it.This is a marvelous, life-affirming masterpiece, and one of the two films of 2007 that uses food to express a deep and profound love of life.",5,ANIMATION AT THE LEVEL OF A WORK OF ART,1221004800,"09 10, 2008",2008,1346,"['Possibly', '2007', 'film', 'closest', 'perfection', 'Pixar', 'Ratatouille', 'animated', 'comedy', 'focus', 'story', 'rat', 'named', 'Remy', 'who', 'sense', 'smell', 'great', 'talent', 'culinary', 'arts', 'who', 'secret', 'chef', 'French', 'restaurant', 'managing', 'be', 'hit', 'gourmets', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'chef', 'rodent.But', 'something', 'magical', 'way', 'focus', 'more', 'story', 'scullery', 'kitchen', 'lad', 'fellow', 'kitchen', 'superiors', 'including', 'dominating', 'Colette', 'voiced', 'Janeane', 'Garofalo', 'realize', 'human', 'animal', 'was', 'really', 'film', 'main', 'subject', 'along', 'visual', 'look', 'great', 'French', 'paintings', 'animation', 'state-of-the-art', 'thanks', 'directors', 'Brad', 'Bird', 'Jan', 'Pinkava', 'set', 'off', 'wonderful', 'music', 'score', 'life', 'love', 'Paris', 'bar', 'Amazingly', 'film', 'poetic', 'setting', 'contrasting', 'Parisian', 'slums', 'world', 'rats', 'high-class', 'restaurant', 'connoisseurs', 'one', 'best', 'Ernst', 'Lubitsch', 'romantic', 'setting', 'garbage', 'scow', '1932', 'Trouble', 'Paradise', 'Lubitsch', 'Preston', 'Sturges', 'slapstick', 'had', 'wandered', 'it.This', 'marvelous', 'life-affirming', 'masterpiece', 'one', 'two', 'films', '2007', 'food', 'express', 'deep', 'profound', 'love', 'life']",N/A

Once the boy understands the rat's talent, it makes for some pretty funny role playing to keep the secret.

I'll merely state that this is my favorite animated film of the year.  I'll also confess that when I first heard about it and saw the previews, I was not impressed.  To me a movie about a rat who was also a cooking genius seemed both farfetched and ludicrous.  I was convinced that they had more or less run out of ideas.  I was wrong.  The film is bristling with great ideas and wonderful touches of humor.  The software that allows them to produce this level of CGI is nothing short of astonishing.  It only makes you wonder what software thirty years from now is going to make possible.One interesting decision is the way that in their CGI and character design they've decided to go incredibly realistic in all inanimate objects, but somewhat ""cartoonish"" in all animated characters.  The software has clearly come to the point where it would be possible to make humans look extremely realistic.  Instead, they decided to make them look like extreme caricatures.  I personally applaud this decision.  It makes for far more expressive characters.  Also, if they were trying for extreme realism it would call too much attention to that fact.After this film and THE INCREDIBLES, I might be willing to say that Brad Bird is my favorite animated director currently working in the United States.  I can't be too confident in saying that simple because his total body of work is too small.

And, indeed, there are times when the pacing does tend to drag a bit even for more seasoned moviegoers like myself.  Still, the action scenes are palpitating in their energy and excitement, and even those jaded by the unimaginable strides made in CGI technology over the years will be properly bowled over by what the filmmakers have managed to pull off here.  The sheer fluidity of movement alone in this film is draw-dropping in its impressiveness.  The story is rather less compelling overall, but one has to admire Bird's willingness to keep the drama at least somewhat intimate and life-sized.  The price of that subtlety, however, is that the movie is also a trifle dull in spots.The film is highly blessed with energetic voice work by the likes of Patton Oswalt, Ian Holm, Lou Romano, Brad Garrett, Peter O'Toole, and, above all, Janeane Garofalo as a high-strung, up-and-coming chef who doesn't take too kindly to fresh-out-of-the-oven competitors encroaching on her territory.But it is the exquisitely designed backdrops that finally make ""Ratatouille"" a thing of joy and beauty.

Or cinema snob that I am, perhaps I should say ""a Brad Bird movie."" Either way, ""Ratatouille"" is Pixar's out-and-out art film -- that is, a movie about the joys and risks of becoming an artist, about reconciling art with the demands of survival, about the support networks without which no artist flourishes. My god, the movie even has something wise to say about why critics are so damn critical, in both senses.I don't want to give the impression that ""Ratatouille"" is some sort of brow-wrinkler; it's a fast and funny comedy that held even the youngest viewers' attention at the screening I attended. But it's also the most sophisticated comedy that Pixar has ever produced, one whose rat-artist hero's very existence makes the eloquent point that ""most artists wind up back in the sewer instead of making it to the kitchen,"" as my friend Flatrat put it in a line I couldn't let go unquoted.Everything works in the movie, but I'd like to make a special and rather selfish mention of Michael Giacchino's musical score, a blend of light jazz and French pop song -- a rare treat for those of us who grew up listening to both.This is a superficial note on a film that deserves a lengthier recommendation than I what I've just written.

Remy is a young rat who discovers that he has a heightened sense of taste and smell, and becomes inspired by the late television chef Auguste Gusteau (Brad Garrett), whose motto ""anyone can cook"" now extends to rats, too. Remy begins to experiment with combining classic combinations of flavor and texture, herbs, and other ingredients, until his clan is forced to flee their country safehouse.During the traumatic escape, Remy is separated from his family. The ghost of Chef Gusteau appears to Remy when he is discouraged, inspiring him to cook at Gusteau's formerly-five star restaurant. The acid restaurant critic Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole) made it his personal mission to write a scathing review of Gusteau's that stripped it of one of its Michelin stars, consigning it to the tourist trade. Now, the restaurant is under the iron fist of the shady, domineering Head Chef Skinner (Ian Holm). Remy befriends the bumbling, couldn't-boil-water-if-his-life-depended-on-it Alfredo Linguini, whom Skinner grudgingly adopted as the new garbage boy, and Remy and Linguini team up to create culinary delights that astound the normally staid French restaurant critics. Remy controls Linguini by hiding under his chef's toque and tugging on two strands of hair (the scenes of Remy perfecting his technique with a blindfolded Linguini wielding dangerous tools and messy ingredients are priceless). Toss in a handful of intrigue, kitchen highjinks, father-son bonding, a dash of romance with the formidable chef Colette, and plenty of culinary delights, and you have Ratatouille.The 3D animation is photorealistic, and 360 shots of nighttime Paris entrance. Small touches really capture the Bohemian feel of the Montmartre district, and the soundtrack features (brief) snippets of La Marseillaise, light and airy French themes, and French-language vocals by Camille (the standalone soundtrackRatatouilleis available for purchase). As with The Incredibles, there's lots to keep kids engaged (although the scene with the window full of dead rats might be traumatic for very young kids), and a whole other layer of adult humor bubbling under the surface, so mom and dad will be able to enjoy Ratatouille with gusto.",5,A gustatory journey through Paris,1205366400,"03 13, 2008",2008,2469,"['Ratatouille', 'Pixar', 'Brad', 'Bird', 'Incredibles', 'Two-Disc', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'Iron', 'Giant', 'Special', 'Edition', ""rat's-eye"", 'view', 'gastronomic', 'delights', 'fine', 'cuisine', 'name', 'pun', 'classic', 'French', 'roast', 'vegetable', 'dish', 'ratatouille', 'Remy', 'young', 'rat', 'who', 'heightened', 'sense', 'taste', 'smell', 'becomes', 'inspired', 'late', 'television', 'chef', 'Auguste', 'Gusteau', 'Brad', 'Garrett', 'motto', 'anyone', 'can', 'cook', 'now', 'rats', 'too', 'Remy', 'experiment', 'combining', 'classic', 'combinations', 'flavor', 'texture', 'herbs', 'other', 'ingredients', 'clan', 'forced', 'flee', 'country', 'safehouse.During', 'traumatic', 'escape', 'Remy', 'separated', 'family', 'ghost', 'Chef', 'Gusteau', 'Remy', 'when', 'discouraged', 'inspiring', 'cook', 'Gusteau', 'formerly-five', 'star', 'restaurant', 'acid', 'restaurant', 'critic', 'Anton', 'Ego', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'made', 'personal', 'mission', 'write', 'scathing', 'review', 'Gusteau', 'stripped', 'one', 'Michelin', 'stars', 'consigning', 'tourist', 'trade', 'Now', 'restaurant', 'iron', 'fist', 'shady', 'domineering', 'Head', 'Chef', 'Skinner', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'Remy', 'bumbling', ""couldn't-boil-water-if-his-life-depended-on-it"", 'Alfredo', 'Linguini', 'whom', 'Skinner', 'grudgingly', 'adopted', 'new', 'garbage', 'boy', 'Remy', 'Linguini', 'team', 'up', 'create', 'culinary', 'delights', 'astound', 'normally', 'staid', 'French', 'restaurant', 'critics', 'Remy', 'Linguini', 'hiding', 'chef', 'toque', 'tugging', 'two', 'strands', 'hair', 'scenes', 'Remy', 'perfecting', 'technique', 'blindfolded', 'Linguini', 'wielding', 'dangerous', 'tools', 'messy', 'ingredients', 'are', 'priceless', 'Toss', 'handful', 'intrigue', 'kitchen', 'highjinks', 'father-son', 'bonding', 'dash', 'romance', 'formidable', 'chef', 'Colette', 'plenty', 'culinary', 'delights', 'have', 'Ratatouille.The', '3D', 'animation', 'photorealistic', '360', 'shots', 'nighttime', 'Paris', 'entrance', 'Small', 'touches', 'really', 'capture', 'Bohemian', 'feel', 'Montmartre', 'district', 'soundtrack', 'features', 'brief', 'snippets', 'La', 'Marseillaise', 'light', 'airy', 'French', 'themes', 'French-language', 'vocals', 'Camille', 'standalone', 'soundtrackRatatouilleis', 'available', 'purchase', 'Incredibles', 'lots', 'keep', 'kids', 'engaged', 'scene', 'window', 'full', 'dead', 'rats', 'might', 'be', 'traumatic', 'very', 'young', 'kids', 'whole', 'other', 'layer', 'adult', 'humor', 'bubbling', 'surface', 'mom', 'dad', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'enjoy', 'Ratatouille', 'gusto']",N/A

Suffice it to say that Pixar's animation has never been better, and both the kitchen of Gusteau's restaurant and the streets of Paris shine.  But the highlight of this film is its wonderful story, capped by a speech by food critic Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole) about the flaws of being a professional critic and the struggle to create.  O'Toole's speech should have every half-baked film critic second-guessing every review ever written, but gives hope to every struggling artist - including chefs.The movie's theme inspires me to try to pair it with another, like pairing a fine wine with the right food.

1100567,A6UGTB17P5BX8,B000VBJEEG,Simon Gifford,"[1, 2]","R&eacute;my (Patton Oswalt) is a rat, constantly risking life in an expensive French restaurant because of his love of good food, as well as a desire to become a chef. Yet, obviously, this is a rather tough dream for a rat. But opportunity knocks when a young boy named Linguini (Lou Romano), who desperately needs to keep his job at the restaurant, despite his lack of cooking abilities, discovers and partners the young R&eacute;my. Its up to the two of them to avoid the insane head chef, bring the rest of R&eacute;my's family up to his standards, win his partner a girl, and, of course, produce the finest ratatouille in all of France.The short feature preceding this, Lifted, involving an alien spaceship, is brilliant, now that WAS funny! Not wanting to put a dampner on things, but I didn't actually find Ratatouille as funny as previous Pixar films such as Monsters, Inc., Toy Story or The Incredibles.OK, there were some funny scenes/gags in it and great slapstick when Linguini is ""controlled"" by R&eacute;my tugging on his hair underneath his chef's hat, but it isn't a laff-riot in my opinion and quite a lot goes by without many obvious jokes.However, strangely, that may work in the film's favour as where it is strongest is in its story - the well-rounded characters that show more subtlety than most real human actors, the human characters like loveable loser Linguini and female chef Colette (Janeane Garofalo), as well as our rat hero R&eacute;my, and some scenes which are surprisingly emotional and touching. Pixar has always been very good at that sort of thing and the complexity and beleivability of the relationships in the film - for example, some moments of shy arkwardness between Linguini and Colette will strike a chord with any nervous guy who has fallen in love, or the scenes involving R&eacute;my and his family are perhaps even more appealing to adults than to children.Peter O'Toole steals the show as slimy food critic Anton Ego, himself a swipe at critics.Overall, despite the lack of belly laughs, it's a very enjoyable, fine animated film.",4,Pixar's strength of character,1192924800,"10 21, 2007",2007,2079,"['R', 'eacute', 'Patton', 'Oswalt', 'rat', 'constantly', 'risking', 'life', 'expensive', 'French', 'restaurant', 'love', 'good', 'food', 'as', 'well', 'desire', 'become', 'chef', 'obviously', 'rather', 'tough', 'dream', 'rat', 'opportunity', 'knocks', 'when', 'young', 'boy', 'named', 'Linguini', 'Lou', 'Romano', 'who', 'desperately', 'keep', 'job', 'restaurant', 'lack', 'cooking', 'abilities', 'discovers', 'partners', 'young', 'R', 'eacute', 'two', 'avoid', 'insane', 'head', 'chef', 'bring', 'rest', 'R', 'eacute', 'family', 'up', 'standards', 'win', 'partner', 'girl', 'course', 'produce', 'finest', 'ratatouille', 'France.The', 'short', 'feature', 'preceding', 'Lifted', 'involving', 'alien', 'spaceship', 'brilliant', 'now', 'WAS', 'funny', 'Not', 'wanting', 'put', 'dampner', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'actually', 'find', 'Ratatouille', 'as', 'funny', 'previous', 'Pixar', 'films', 'such', 'Monsters', 'Inc.', 'Toy', 'Story', 'Incredibles.OK', 'were', 'funny', 'scenes/gags', 'great', 'slapstick', 'when', 'Linguini', 'controlled', 'R', 'eacute', 'tugging', 'hair', 'chef', 'hat', ""n't"", 'laff-riot', 'opinion', 'quite', 'lot', 'many', 'obvious', 'jokes.However', 'strangely', 'may', 'work', 'film', 'favour', 'where', 'strongest', 'story', 'well-rounded', 'characters', 'show', 'more', 'subtlety', 'most', 'real', 'human', 'actors', 'human', 'characters', 'loveable', 'loser', 'Linguini', 'female', 'chef', 'Colette', 'Janeane', 'Garofalo', 'as', 'well', 'rat', 'hero', 'R', 'eacute', 'scenes', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'emotional', 'touching', 'Pixar', 'always', 'been', 'very', 'good', 'sort', 'thing', 'complexity', 'beleivability', 'relationships', 'film', 'example', 'moments', 'shy', 'arkwardness', 'Linguini', 'Colette', 'will', 'strike', 'chord', 'nervous', 'guy', 'who', 'fallen', 'love', 'scenes', 'involving', 'R', 'eacute', 'family', 'are', 'perhaps', 'even', 'more', 'appealing', 'adults', 'children.Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'show', 'slimy', 'food', 'critic', 'Anton', 'Ego', 'swipe', 'critics.Overall', 'lack', 'belly', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'fine', 'animated', 'film']",N/A

1100571,A1ZWKF4TAYZS8Z,B000VBJEEG,SpaceHippieGeek,"[0, 2]","Ratatouille was cute and funny. Remy, the lead character is a rat who struggles with the choice between being his true self in a world of humans, and being with all his family and loved ones. With humans, Remy can cook and produce food, but has few real relationships. He and the human Linguini share a common love of food, but their cross-species friendship is often strained by misunderstanding. With his fellow rats, Remy has a community and the respect of his peers, but is forbidden from his passion. Eventually, Remy is able to reconcile his two worlds with a charming message of friendhip, loyalty, and love.The writers deserve props for Collette - a female character that is tough as nails while maintaining her humanity. She is likeable and relatable, without being at all weak. Instead, she is sympathetic because her compassion comes from a place of strength.Another great aspect to this movie is the atmosphere. The Parisian scenery brings to life a city of passion and love. The animators did a great job. This is a new style of CG. The artwork has such heart to it, that I almost forgot it wasn't water colour animated.Despite all these good things, the film still falls short. It is difficult to suspend disbelief about talking animals when they interact with talking humans. The mix of rat and human storylines also limits the character development opportunities. In the human world, we enjoy following Linguini's career and romantic aspirations and, in the rat world, we grow to care about Remy's journy, but there isn't enough screen time to get any depth in either storyline.The other big flaw, which will only annoy pedantic animal lovers like myself, is in the very premise of the movie. Rats actually have an excellent sense of smell. And while, in urban settings, they get dirty out of necessity, they are very picky about what they eat. This is the big flaw which keeps the movie from being a keeper. As much as I kept telling myself it was fantasy, I kept getting distracted by the lack of realism.",3,"good story, great scenery, not perfect",1238544000,"04 1, 2009",2009,2023,"['Ratatouille', 'was', 'cute', 'funny', 'Remy', 'lead', 'character', 'rat', 'who', 'choice', 'being', 'true', 'self', 'world', 'humans', 'being', 'family', 'loved', 'ones', 'humans', 'Remy', 'can', 'cook', 'produce', 'food', 'few', 'real', 'relationships', 'human', 'Linguini', 'share', 'common', 'love', 'food', 'cross-species', 'friendship', 'often', 'strained', 'misunderstanding', 'fellow', 'rats', 'Remy', 'community', 'respect', 'peers', 'forbidden', 'passion', 'Eventually', 'Remy', 'able', 'reconcile', 'two', 'worlds', 'charming', 'message', 'friendhip', 'loyalty', 'love.The', 'writers', 'deserve', 'props', 'Collette', 'female', 'character', 'tough', 'nails', 'maintaining', 'humanity', 'likeable', 'relatable', 'being', 'weak', 'Instead', 'sympathetic', 'compassion', 'place', 'strength.Another', 'great', 'aspect', 'movie', 'atmosphere', 'Parisian', 'scenery', 'life', 'city', 'passion', 'love', 'animators', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'new', 'style', 'CG', 'artwork', 'such', 'heart', 'almost', 'forgot', 'was', ""n't"", 'water', 'colour', 'good', 'things', 'film', 'still', 'short', 'difficult', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'talking', 'animals', 'when', 'interact', 'talking', 'humans', 'mix', 'rat', 'human', 'storylines', 'also', 'character', 'development', 'opportunities', 'human', 'world', 'enjoy', 'following', 'Linguini', 'career', 'romantic', 'aspirations', 'rat', 'world', 'grow', 'care', 'Remy', 'journy', ""n't"", 'enough', 'screen', 'time', 'get', 'depth', 'storyline.The', 'other', 'big', 'flaw', 'will', 'only', 'annoy', 'pedantic', 'animal', 'lovers', 'very', 'premise', 'movie', 'Rats', 'actually', 'have', 'excellent', 'sense', 'smell', 'urban', 'settings', 'get', 'dirty', 'necessity', 'are', 'very', 'picky', 'what', 'eat', 'big', 'flaw', 'movie', 'being', 'keeper', 'As', 'much', 'kept', 'telling', 'was', 'fantasy', 'kept', 'getting', 'distracted', 'lack', 'realism']",N/A
1100572,A3FEQXNCFC68KC,B000VBJEEG,"SRFireside ""ZOOM!""","[5, 7]","Pixar and director Brad Bird hits another one out of the park with an entertaining, funny and even informative take on haute cuisine. Ratatouille combines themes such as a rags to riches story, father and son dynamics, living a double life, and of course rats and food. Pixar has always been good with smart family entertainment and this movie is no different. My four year old son loves it. My 20 year old daughter loves it. I love it. This is one of those films that will undoubtedly endure the test of time.The basic story is a rat with a keen sense of smell and a love for making food gets separated from his family and ends up at the restaurant of his favorite chef. In a strange turn of events Remy (the rat voiced by Patton Oswalt) creates a soup that everybody loves, but credit was given to the garbage boy. Remy and said garbage boy Linguini (Lou Romano) come up with a plan to keep Remy cooking with Linguini as the cover. From there you get plenty of hijinks, cartoon thrills, a little romance, some character development, and all around fun times.It doesn't matter how good the animation is on a movie. If the script doesn't deliver the movie won't either (just look at Final Fantasy). Ratatouille's is sharp. It hits all the marks in story development and gives a really nice pacing on events. My only gripe is there was an action scene or two that felt forced just to add some excitement while not really lending to the story very well. Other than that the plot was pitch perfect.While a great story is the backbone to a good movie good animation doesn't hurt. I can't really say much that most people who watch Pixar movies already know. The animation excels. The fine details from the hairs on the rats and humans to the look of the food to the stylistic backgrounds. It all shows quality. I can't help think a bit of The Incredibles theory is in the design, which would make sense considering Brad Bird directed that one too.Another thing that can make or break the immersion level of an animated movie is the sound and voice acting. Pixar always finds a way to get the best out of their actors and make them sound like professional voice talents. It's all great, but I would like to make note of my personal standouts. Lou Romano as Linguini gives a ton of character for somebody who doesn't have much of a voice acting background (he's a design artist). I didn't recognize comedian Janeane Garofalo as Colette she was so convincing. More so for Ian Holm as the main villain Skinner. He knocked it out of the park for me with that outlandish character. Then you have Peter O'Toole as food critic Anton Ego. This man steals the show with his voice and the subtle intonation in his performance resonates.This Blu-Ray is a re-release of the 2007 Blu-Ray with an additional DVD version added. The special features are identical to the previous release. Here's what you get(* denotes feature on the DVD as well):Pixar Shorts*:Lifted - One of my favorite shorts about an alien abduction... final exam. The human character looks a lot like our human hero Linguini from the movie.Your Friend the Rat - This is actually a very educational and informative short on the history of rats and their relationship to human society. It's told by Remy and his brother and is very entertaining.Fine Food & Film* - Interesting featurette with Brad Bird and top chef Thomas Keller on the food designed for the movie.Cine-Explore - Tons of mini documentaries and interviews can be picked up while watching the movie. Just about everything you wanted to know. I believe you can get this stuff on the main menu as well without using Cine-Explore.Gusteau's Gourmet Game - Never played it. Supposed to be Linguini making food during an increasingly busy meal rush.Deleted Scenes* - Three of them, and they are not finished beyond rough animation. Interesting stuff, but nothing you would have missed.Deleted Scenes R.I.P. - More deleted scenes. I haven't seen them, but I heard they are better than the previous deleted scenes.I am assuming the Easter Eggs are also still in here. Wait for the rat to appear on the main menu and then hit the left directional key.

However, not anyone can make a good movie, especially a good movie that happens to be 100% animated. Fortunately, we have Brad Bird (The Incredibles) mixing ingredients that have made for a most appetizing family film.I know, I know -- if you're a childless adult like me, you probably started to zone out when I said ""family film."" But Ratatouille really is a movie for all ages that neither talks down to the kids, nor panders to the adults with snarky double-entendres. It's simply the story of following your dreams, making them real, and what can happen along the way. And if you just happen to be a blue rat, you can relate all the more!Remy (Patton Oswalt) is rodent with a super-sensitive sense of smell ranging from the redolent to the ravishing -- once discovered, the rat pack uses Remy's precious proboscis to sniff out rot and poison, thereby saving many of their lives and allowing them to become bolder... and steps closer the danger-fraught human-habitat, The City of Lights. Remy, a furry would-be gourmet, wants nothing more than to infiltrate the great kitchens of Paris' finest dining establishments to see how the experts ply their considerable talents in creating culinary combinations.The story is split more or less evenly between Remy's story and that of the humans whose lives his little paws touch. His counterpart in the kitchen is young, nerve-wracked cooking-newbie Linguini (Lou Romano), who just happens to (unwittingly) be the long-lost son of Chef Gusteau. Gusteau is recently deceased, but his leaving of the mortal plane doesn't stop him from becoming Remy's mentor, and -- through Remy -- a father to his son.Ratatouille features the voices of some pretty heavy-hitting actors and those with highly recognizable voices (Peter O'Toole, Ian Holm, Janeane Garofalo, Brian Dennehy), but showmanship doesn't drown the main course. Nor are there silly songs, stupid jokes, or pop-culture references. It was obviously made to be a timeless story, and on that level it succeeds.Ratatouille also succeeds on a visual level, using CG animation to tastefully and artfully display everything from fur to fabric to facades. Paris is stunningly recreated via computer, and the rats, while certainly not realistic-looking in the least, do display naturalistic scurries and tail-taps.In short, this rat calls for a toast.",5,Catch this rat,1182816000,"06 26, 2007",2007,2419,"['According', 'master', 'Parisian', 'chef', 'Gusteau', 'Brad', 'Garrett', 'Anyone', 'can', 'cook', 'However', 'not', 'anyone', 'can', 'make', 'good', 'movie', 'especially', 'good', 'movie', 'be', '100', '%', 'animated', 'Fortunately', 'have', 'Brad', 'Bird', 'Incredibles', 'mixing', 'ingredients', 'have', 'made', 'most', 'appetizing', 'family', 'film.I', 'know', 'know', ""'re"", 'childless', 'adult', 'probably', 'started', 'zone', 'out', 'when', 'said', 'family', 'film', 'Ratatouille', 'really', 'movie', 'ages', 'talks', 'down', 'kids', 'panders', 'adults', 'snarky', 'double-entendres', 'simply', 'story', 'following', 'dreams', 'making', 'real', 'what', 'can', 'happen', 'way', 'just', 'happen', 'be', 'blue', 'rat', 'can', 'relate', 'more', 'Remy', 'Patton', 'Oswalt', 'rodent', 'super-sensitive', 'sense', 'smell', 'ranging', 'redolent', 'ravishing', 'once', 'discovered', 'rat', 'pack', 'Remy', 'precious', 'proboscis', 'sniff', 'out', 'rot', 'poison', 'thereby', 'saving', 'many', 'lives', 'allowing', 'become', 'bolder', 'steps', 'closer', 'danger-fraught', 'human-habitat', 'City', 'Lights', 'Remy', 'furry', 'would-be', 'gourmet', 'nothing', 'more', 'infiltrate', 'great', 'kitchens', 'Paris', 'finest', 'dining', 'establishments', 'see', 'how', 'experts', 'ply', 'considerable', 'talents', 'creating', 'culinary', 'combinations.The', 'story', 'split', 'more', 'less', 'evenly', 'Remy', 'story', 'humans', 'little', 'paws', 'touch', 'counterpart', 'kitchen', 'young', 'nerve-wracked', 'cooking-newbie', 'Linguini', 'Lou', 'Romano', 'who', 'just', 'unwittingly', 'be', 'long-lost', 'son', 'Chef', 'Gusteau', 'Gusteau', 'recently', 'deceased', 'leaving', 'mortal', 'plane', ""n't"", 'stop', 'becoming', 'Remy', 'mentor', 'Remy', 'father', 'son.Ratatouille', 'voices', 'pretty', 'heavy-hitting', 'actors', 'highly', 'recognizable', 'voices', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'Ian', 'Holm', 'Janeane', 'Garofalo', 'Brian', 'Dennehy', 'showmanship', ""n't"", 'drown', 'main', 'course', 'are', 'silly', 'songs', 'stupid', 'jokes', 'pop-culture', 'references', 'was', 'obviously', 'made', 'be', 'timeless', 'story', 'level', 'also', 'visual', 'level', 'using', 'CG', 'animation', 'tastefully', 'artfully', 'display', 'everything', 'fur', 'fabric', 'facades', 'Paris', 'stunningly', 'recreated', 'computer', 'rats', 'certainly', 'not', 'realistic-looking', 'least', 'do', 'display', 'naturalistic', 'scurries', 'tail-taps.In', 'short', 'rat', 'toast']",N/A
1100578,ASR6EDD3ES7JW,B000VBJEEG,SteakSalad101,"[4, 6]","I entered the theater for ""Ratatouille"" hungry. Yeah, my stomach sort of was craving that buttery, salty, hydrogenated fatty taste of popcorn. But aside that--I was hungry for a fantastic animated film that has been absolutely raved upon by distinguished critics and average moviegoers alike. Hungry just like a food critic is about fine French cuisine.Mmm, and did I leave the theater full of what I wanted (not only the popcorn!) Quite bluntly, ""Ratatouille"" is one of the most original films I've seen in recent memory, and also one of the best movies so far of 2007.The film deals with a rat named Remey living in the French suburbs. Remey isn't any ordinary rat...unlike the tastes of garbage which his family and friends crave, Remey wants REAL food...human food, as he initially calls it. When he and his family are kicked out of this quaint town, Remey finds himself in Paris, with a new friend called Linguini, a human, who is the pimply-faced teenaged janitor for a highly regarded classy 5-star French restaurant.The problem is, Linguini wants to be a chef. And since Remey knows how to cook (and damn well) he teams with Linguini by hiding under his chef hat, controlling his actions (by pulling on his hair) to create the best food in Paris.Hilarity ensues. Truly, I expected nothing less from master filmmaker Brad Bird, who brought us The Incredibles, and some of the early days of The Simpsons. The directing is very well-done, the screenplay is superior, and the voice talent is absolutely BRILLIANT. Peter O'Toole plays the hungry, evil, most cynical food critic around and executes the role seamlessly (and painfully funny too, if you're familiar with his other work as I am!) Sometimes absolutely hysterical, sometimes the ""awwwh"" moment of feeling sorry for someone, sometimes downright absurd--like fine food, it's got something for everyone. I saw it with my little brother, who happens to be six years old, and the movie was silly enough to keep him entertained and sophisticated enough to keep me and my dad laughing throughout.Ratatouille is indeed worth all the hype it's collected in the month it's been released.

When he saves his dad from eating food laced with poison, he's given a job as food tester for the whole colony. Remy quickly becomes bored with the job and dreams of better things. After seeing a TV cooking show, he decides that he would like to be a chef. Unfortunately, he's almost killed by the TVs owner and the entire colony is discovered and forced to leave her house.Remy is separated from his family and talks to an illustration of Gusteau, the TV chef, because he's alone and there's nobody else to talk to. When he discovers Gusteau's restaurant, he finds that he knows the function of every member of the staff. Remy gets into trouble when entering the kitchen, but he adds ingredients to the soup and the customers love it. He's discovered when trying to leave and Linguini (Romano), the kitchen boy, is told to kill him. But the worried look on Remy's face stops Linguini in his tracks and he realizes that Remy fixed the soup. The two decide to work together.Although Remy can be understood by other rats, that's not the case with humans. Instead, he uses gestures to communicate and is very expressive. His tiny shrugs and nods are easy to understand. Quite by accident, Remy discovers that he can control Linguini by pulling at strands of his hair. The two practice at home and come up with a plan to do the same at the restaurant. He hides under Linguini's hat and continues to prepare food by controlling him.The story is well thought out and quite complex in places for an animated film. The 111-minute running time is necessary to show everything in detail. The streets of Paris look real and it's clear that the Pixar team researched the setting thoroughly.Linguini is trained by Colette (Garofalo) and starts to develop feelings for her, but it's Remy's skill that wins the approval of the restaurant's customers. Linguini is deeply resented by the Head Chef (Holm), who knows that Linguini is Gusteau's son and the restaurant's rightful owner. The problem is, Linguini doesn't know that.The film is full of peril, chase scenes and humor, and has a little action. The characters are well developed and Remy is easy to like. It's challenging to make a rat appear friendly and lovable, but Pixar somehow pulls it off. Remy is always happy and smiling and chooses to walk upright on two feet. I think that was done to make him appear more like a human and less like a rat. He's also very particular about cleanliness and washes his paws before preparing any food.The restaurant eventually captures the attention of food critics and is visited by Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole), who is the most famous critic of them all. He's hard to impress and had written off Gusteau's as insignificant years ago, but decides to see why it's become relevant again. One of my favorite scenes happens in the restaurant when Ego takes his first bite of food, but I'll let you discover what happens for yourself.The film has a lot of important messages. It shows us that it's wrong to steal and that family is important. But most of all, it's about following your dreams. Remy is a rat. How can he possibly become a chef? Even if he did, how could he succeed? I imagine that children watching the film could be inspired by Remy's achievements. Maybe a few will grow up wanting to be chefs, and they are rarely out of work.I can't watch the film without thinking about Hans Landa's speech in Inglourious Basterds where he asks Perrier LaPadite what his reaction would be if a rat entered his home. How would that differ if a squirrel were to enter? It's true that humans often have a problem with rats, and many of us actually fear them. It's quite an achievement to invent a rat that we like and root for as he attempts to live out his dream.All of Pixar's movies are worth owning, but Ratatouille just edges out Up as my favorite. If they ever decide to do another sequel, I hope that we get another story about Remy. It's aimed at older audiences more than the likes of Cars and A Bug's Life, but children will still be able to enjoy it.Well done, Pixar.Video Quality 5/5Ratatouille looks fantastic on Blu-ray. You can see the individual hairs in Remy's fur and the way it beads when he gets wet. The colors are striking and the sheer amount of detail in background scenes tells you all you need to know. This is a reference quality presentation that's ideal for showing off your home theater.Audio Quality 5/5The lossless LPCM 5.1 track is full of subtle detail and delivers well during all of the louder scenes. Although there's very little traditional action, your system will receive a full workout during chase scenes and when Remy is trying to avoid being captured. The sound has good depth and you'll hear the surrounds highlight quieter effects such as vegetables being chopped or background conversation in the restaurant. Dialogue is crisp and clear throughout and there's really nothing that falls short of perfection.Special Features 3.5/5Lifted (5:02, HD) - One of my favorite short films from Pixar.Your Friend the Rat (11:16, HD) - Remy and Emil talk about the history of rats in an amusing way.Gusteau's Gourmet Game - Control Linguini and help him meet incoming orders.Fine Food and Film (13:54, HD) - Director Brad Bird and chef Thomas Keller talk about some of their ideas for the film.Animation BriefingsDocumentary ShortsDeleted Scenes (15:06) - Three scenes that were removed before they were finished.Deleted Shots R.I.P.

It doesn't have the constant action of some titles, but the story is gripping throughout. Adults will be pleasantly surprised at the depth of the story, although very small children may lose interest. That would be a shame, because I rank it as Pixar's best, and that's saying a lot.",5,The friendliest rat you'll ever meet,1308873600,"06 24, 2011",2011,6894,"['Ratatouille', 'animation', 'comedy',

1100583,AZCDCO6KK2T81,B000VBJEEG,"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan""","[15, 23]","The ""but"" in my headline is the main reason for me giving this movie 3 stars and not 4 or 5 as many have.  I think this latest Pixar film has some serious flaws.  For starters, this film isn't sure who its audience is.  Is it very young kids or older ones?  It isn't geared for teens or adults even though it is very intelligently written and has more of a storyline than others like it.  Disney had this same problem with ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" which kept wildly going back and forth between being a cutsey kids' film and one directed at more ""mature"" children; however, I did enjoy that film, but it performed less than expected by Disney's standards.My other serious issue with this film is the lack of good, consistent humor.  I, to be frank, found this film to be rather unfunny.  There are long stretches in this movie without any jokes or humor at all.  My youngest child (10) was getting very restless with the film and when the silly stuff came on then my older child (15) yawned and didn't even find the humor humorous (nor did I).  Again, there seems to be a serious lack of direction on this film.  Perhaps they attmepted to appease a too broad of an audience.  A noble but flawed intention with animated films.Another flaw is the lack of a quality soundtrack or score with this film.  It doesn't necessarily need some pop-stars with silly hip lyrics, but the music overall in this film was completely forgettable.  I serious drawback, in my view, for a kid's film.  Heck, I love the soundtrack toA Goofy Movieand that was totally directed at young children.On the up side of things the animation is truly outstanding (you can almost count the hairs on the rats for crying out loud).  The script is intelligent, offers a mild, digestible message, and is, overall, rather mature in tone and topic (which shoots over the heads of many little ones).  Finally, the voices are top-notch by all involved.  A special Oscar should go to Peter O'Toole's performance as the self-serving food critic.  In fact, I think it's time we had an additional category for voiceovers in animated features at the Academy Awards.Well, I know I will get ripped for this review as it's hard to criticize a family film without offending someone, but this is my position on this over-rated film, but still somewhat enjoyable summer flick.",3,"Great animation, intelligent story, well-acted, but . . .",1185062400,"07 22, 2007",2007,2330,"['headline', 'main', 'reason', 'giving', 'movie', '3', 'stars', 'not', '4', '5', 'many', 'have', 'think', 'latest', 'Pixar', 'film', 'serious', 'flaws', 'starters', 'film', ""n't"", 'sure', 'who', 'audience', 'very', 'young', 'kids', 'older', 'ones', ""n't"", 'geared', 'teens', 'adults', 'even', 'very', 'intelligently', 'written', 'more', 'storyline', 'others', 'Disney', 'had', 'same', 'problem', 'Hunchback', 'Notre', 'Dame', 'kept', 'wildly', 'going', 'back', 'forth', 'being', 'cutsey', 'kids', 'film', 'one', 'directed', 'more', 'mature', 'children', 'however', 'did', 'enjoy', 'film', 'performed', 'less', 'expected', 'Disney', 'standards.My', 'other', 'serious', 'issue', 'film', 'lack', 'good', 'consistent', 'humor', 'be', 'frank', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'rather', 'unfunny', 'are', 'long', 'stretches', 'movie', 'jokes', 'humor', 'youngest', 'child', '10', 'was', 'getting', 'very', 'restless', 'film', 'when', 'silly', 'stuff', 'came', 'then', 'older', 'child', '15', 'yawned', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'find', 'humor', 'humorous', 'did', 'Again', 'be', 'serious', 'lack', 'direction', 'film', 'Perhaps', 'attmepted', 'appease', 'too', 'broad', 'audience', 'noble', 'flawed', 'intention', 'animated', 'films.Another', 'flaw', 'lack', 'quality', 'soundtrack', 'score', 'film', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'need', 'pop-stars', 'silly', 'hip', 'lyrics', 'music', 'overall', 'film', 'was', 'completely', 'forgettable', 'serious', 'drawback', 'view', 'kid', 'film', 'Heck', 'love', 'soundtrack', 'toA', 'Goofy', 'Movieand', 'was', 'totally', 'directed', 'young', 'children.On', 'up', 'side', 'things', 'animation', 'truly', 'outstanding', 'can', 'almost', 'count', 'hairs', 'rats', 'crying', 'out', 'loud', 'script', 'intelligent', 'mild', 'digestible', 'message', 'overall', 'rather', 'mature', 'tone', 'topic', 'heads', 'many', 'little', 'ones', 'Finally', 'voices', 'are', 'top-notch', 'involved', 'special', 'Oscar', 'should', 'go', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'performance', 'self-serving', 'food', 'critic', 'fact', 'think', 'time', 'had', 'additional', 'category', 'voiceovers', 'animated', 'features', 'Academy', 'Awards.Well', 'know', 'will', 'get', 'ripped', 'review', 'hard', 'criticize', 'family', 'film', 'offending', 'someone', 'position', 'over-rated', 'film', 'still', 'somewhat', 'enjoyable', 'summer', 'flick']",N/A
1100584,A31M2QHES2IMB,B000VBJEEG,"Steven Scott ""LeChuck""","[0, 0]","Pixar can do no wrong with me.  They always have great stories, great casting, and a timeless quality that rival studio Dreamworks has never been able to duplicate.  Ratatouille is fantastic.  Who would have thought that a story about a rat that wants to become a great chef could be so action packed?  I have to wonder about anyone who claims they were bored by this movie.  There's a good mix of action, comedy and drama here and the relationship between Remy the rat and Linguini is perfectly executed.The added touch of Remy having his idol Chef Gusteau pop up and talk to him as a figment of his imagination was also an stellar idea.  The villains in here are great as well, with Ian Holme and Peter O'Toole filling in as an overbearing head chef and a hard to please food critic.  The rest of the voice talent is also well cast with no weak links or annoying celebrities doing their own voices.My only complaint is not directed at the movie itself but at the DVD set for having virtually no features.  There are two shorts, Lifted, which played before Ratatouille in theaters, and another starring Remy and his brother Emile about the history of Rats.  There's one feature that takes a look at a chef who was an inspiration to them as well as Brad Bird recapping how he got started in animation, but other than that, there's only one disc and that doesn't leave a lot of room for some in depth behind the scenes, plus no commentary track!  Why has Pixar all of a sudden stopped giving us the 2 disc treatment?  Other than that, a fantastic movie all around and another success for Pixar.(Reviewer's Edit: I did a little research and as it turns out, When Bluray bought the rights to distribute Disney movies exclusively, part of the deal was to put the features only on Bluray discs, so in order to get features that we've previously enjoyed on DVD, they are forcing you to make the switch to Bluray in order to get them.  Very unfortunate, but I guess that's how they got people to switch over to DVD from VHS 10 years ago.)",4,A 5 star movie but where are the features?,1194825600,"11 12, 2007",2007,2031,"['Pixar', 'can', 'do', 'wrong', 'always', 'have', 'great', 'stories', 'great', 'casting', 'timeless', 'quality', 'rival', 'studio', 'Dreamworks', 'never', 'been', 'able', 'duplicate', 'Ratatouille', 'fantastic', 'Who', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'story', 'rat', 'become', 'great', 'chef', 'could', 'be', 'so', 'action', 'packed', 'have', 'wonder', 'anyone', 'who', 'were', 'bored', 'movie', 'good', 'mix', 'action', 'comedy', 'drama', 'here', 'relationship', 'Remy', 'rat', 'Linguini', 'perfectly', 'executed.The', 'added', 'touch', 'Remy', 'having', 'idol', 'Chef', 'Gusteau', 'pop', 'up', 'talk', 'figment', 'imagination', 'was', 'also', 'stellar', 'idea', 'villains', 'here', 'are', 'great', 'well', 'Ian', 'Holme', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'filling', 'overbearing', 'head', 'chef', 'hard', 'please', 'food', 'critic', 'rest', 'voice', 'talent', 'also', 'well', 'cast', 'weak', 'links', 'annoying', 'celebrities', 'doing', 'own', 'voices.My', 'only', 'complaint', 'not', 'directed', 'movie', 'DVD', 'set', 'having', 'virtually', 'features', 'are', 'two', 'shorts', 'Lifted', 'played', 'Ratatouille', 'theaters', 'starring', 'Remy', 'brother', 'Emile', 'history', 'Rats', 'one', 'feature', 'look', 'chef', 'who', 'was', 'inspiration', 'as', 'well', 'Brad', 'Bird', 'recapping', 'how', 'got', 'started', 'animation', 'other', 'only', 'one', 'disc', ""n't"", 'leave', 'lot', 'room', 'depth', 'scenes', 'commentary', 'track', 'Why', 'Pixar', 'sudden', 'stopped', 'giving', '2', 'disc', 'treatment', 'Other', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'around', 'success', 'Pixar', 'Reviewer', 'Edit', 'did', 'little', 'research', 'out', 'When', 'Bluray', 'bought', 'rights', 'distribute', 'Disney', 'movies', 'exclusively', 'part', 'deal', 'was', 'put', 'features', 'only', 'Bluray', 'discs', 'so', 'order', 'get', 'features', ""'ve"", 'previously', 'enjoyed', 'DVD', 'are', 'forcing', 'make', 'switch', 'Bluray', 'order', 'get', 'Very', 'unfortunate', 'guess', 'how', 'got', 'people', 'switch', 'DVD', 'VHS', '10', 'years', 'ago']",N/A

1100589,A1K3NQAO49LXL2,B000VBJEEG,"Surferofromantica ""S.O.R.""","[0, 0]","I wondered why Pixar picked this as a title for their new movie, considering that it's a French dish and you need to educate people how to pronounce it on the movie poster itself; but by the time you've seen the movie to the end it becomes apparent why it could not be called anything else. Pixar seems to have been making kids movies that adults can enjoy, but this seems to me to be the first time they've made an adult movie that kids can enjoy.I was a bit sceptical about this film at first, since the trailers didn't make it look very interesting - sort of ho-hum like Flushed Away or something - but the reviews were all so glowing (the Rotten Tomatoes critics poll gave it a 96 percent approval) that I had to see it. And it really lived up to those reviews. The film is about a rat that wants to cook, and while the UB40 song ""Rat in the Kitchen"" is never used, the idea of rats being icky creatures to be banished from the kitchen is a sqeamish thought that's... never really addressed here.  It kind of makes me think of an essay I read in Esquire in the mid-80s about the 50 most influential people of the 20th century (so far).  One of them was Walt Disney, and the hypothesis of the essay is that Disney could take a story like Franz Kafka's the Metamorphosis and turn it into a song and dance with a cute cockroach and melt everyone's hearts (which they tried to do with ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame""). Well, Disney put clothes on a rat and called him Mickey, but Pixar pushed the envelope a bit by putting a real, raw rat in the kitchen and asked us to be happy that he's handling the foodstuffs without a proper de-lousing.  And we fell for it.  Does this mean that Pixar is clever, or does this mean that we're idiots?  Well, Disney was never as bold, and now Pixar has taken the step that that Esquire article warned us about.  Hilarious.As good as Pixar is, it has gotten a bit derivative recently - the Incredibles, as good as the film was, ripped off both the Watchmen (plot) and the Fantastic Four (powers, villain).  Cars was a rehash of ""Doc Hollywood,"" but with automobiles.  But Ratatouille is something different.  There are bizarre non-sequitars: where are the female rats in all this, why not show more of Remy's childhood to understand how he became so interested in cooking rather than introduce him as if he were a character in ""Trainspotting""; and Linguini's abrupt romance is a bit difficult to understand.But never mind, the story of the little restaurant that could... then couldn't... then could again is quite a lot of fun.  Sure there's that icky part where the friends' conflicting emotions cause them to momentarily betray each other (every movie needs its movie cliche), but the way the ending is wrapped up is quite impressive.

After watching a television infomercial about how easy it might be to complete a certain task thanks to a miracle invention, many of us perhaps call the toll free number, hand over our credit card information and are then on are way to dicing and slicing with the newest and sharpest steak knives out there. There is just something about those mysterious salesmen on television that we simply cannot get enough of and as a society we become lemmings to the messages for the products they sell.When Remy overheard one such advertisement for a book named Anyone Can Cook written by famed French chef Gusteau (voice by Brad Garrett), Remy decided that it was time for him to make a life for himself and follow the footsteps of his television mentor, Gusteau. Remy already had a flawless appreciation of both the tastes and smells of good food and it would be a natural progression for such a food critic and aficionado to move into the kitchen. There was just one thing holding Remy back: he is a rat.In Ratatouille , a story of an amazing rat that seeks not the human scraps and waste that so many other rats crave but instead wants to find the sharpest of cheese and the finest of fruits. Remy (voice by Patton Oswalt) is not your typical, everyday rat that wants to hang out in the sewers, rather, he wants to hang out in the kitchen of a fine French restaurant.Remy befriends a young and awkward man by the name of Linguini (voice by Lou Romano). When Gusteau's restaurant is being run by Skinner (voice by Ian Holme) after the passing away of restaurant great Gusteau, Linguini who is merely a dishwasher and floor sweeper at the restaurant out of pre-death wish of Gusteau, magically concocts a soup dish that the entire dining room simply goes crazy for. Of course, Linguini can thank much of his success to a ""little chef"" that helps him out along the way.The success that Linguini has stumbled upon thanks to the help of the ""little chef"" then sets off a battle between he and Skinner and in fact due to some legal issues, as well, the battle becomes further complicated. Though Skinner perhaps has visions of grandeur for the Gusteau brand and wishes to enter the microwave burrito market (amongst other things) it is in fact Linguini that restores the fame that the Gusteau name carried for so long.Written by Brad Bird and Jan Pinkman, Ratatouille is an amazingly well done animated film and there are certainly times that as an adult you almost forget that you are watching a children's movie. The story line of the film is creative and fun and there was never a time throughout the film that the viewer could become bored with what is going on.Ratatouille was nominated and ended up winning the 2008 Oscar for Best Animated Feature of the Year and it is no surprise as to why this is the case. The movie is an amazingly well done animated work that is both fun to watch and impressive to view in terms of the effort paid to detail that is evidenced by this film.This film would be the ideal family movie night film as it certainly would appeal to all members of the family, young and old. As with most Disney-Pixar films, the film seemed to be flawless in terms of production and the animation itself was nothing but top notch.Even if you are scared of rats, Ratatouille provides the viewer with a great film that shows perhaps a more likable and lovable side of rats that we perhaps have never experienced before. And from now on if I ever see an actual rat having a piece of gruyere matched nicely with a cabernet sauvignon , it will be hard not to think about the amazing things that this creature might be able to concoct in the kitchen if he is only given the chance.",5,There's a rat in the kitchen...but he can stay!,1207612800,"04 8, 2008",2008,3723,"['have', 'likely', 'done', 'same', 'thing', 'watching', 'television', 'infomercial', 'how', 'easy', 'might', 'be', 'complete', 'certain', 'task', 'thanks', 'miracle', 'invention', 'many', 'perhaps', 'call', 'toll', 'free', 'number', 'hand', 'credit', 'card', 'information', 'are', 'then', 'are', 'way', 'dicing', 'slicing', 'newest', 'sharpest', 'steak', 'out', 'there', 'just', 'something', 'mysterious', 'salesmen', 'television', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'enough', 'society', 'become', 'lemmings', 'messages', 'products', 'sell.When', 'Remy', 'overheard', 'one', 'such', 'advertisement', 'book', 'named', 'Anyone', 'Can', 'Cook', 'written', 'famed', 'French', 'chef', 'Gusteau', 'voice', 'Brad', 'Garrett', 'Remy', 'decided', 'was', 'time', 'make', 'life', 'follow', 'footsteps', 'television', 'mentor', 'Gusteau', 'Remy', 'already', 'had', 'flawless', 'appreciation', 'tastes', 'smells', 'good', 'food', 'would', 'be', 'natural', 'progression', 'food', 'critic', 'aficionado', 'move', 'kitchen', 'was', 'just', 'one', 'thing', 'holding', 'Remy', 'back', 'rat.In', 'Ratatouille', 'story', 'amazing', 'rat', 'not', 'human', 'scraps', 'waste', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'rats', 'crave', 'instead', 'find', 'sharpest', 'cheese', 'finest', 'fruits', 'Remy', 'voice', 'Patton', 'Oswalt', 'not', 'typical', 'everyday', 'rat', 'hang', 'out', 'sewers', 'rather', 'hang', 'out', 'kitchen', 'fine', 'French', 'restaurant.Remy', 'young', 'awkward', 'man', 'name', 'Linguini', 'voice', 'Lou', 'Romano', 'When', 'Gusteau', 'restaurant', 'being', 'run', 'Skinner', 'voice', 'Ian', 'Holme', 'passing', 'away', 'restaurant', 'great', 'Gusteau', 'Linguini', 'who', 'merely', 'dishwasher', 'floor', 'sweeper', 'restaurant', 'pre-death', 'wish', 'Gusteau', 'magically', 'soup', 'dish', 'entire', 'dining', 'room', 'simply', 'crazy', 'course', 'Linguini', 'can', 'thank', 'much', 'success', 'little', 'chef', 'out', 'way.The', 'success', 'Linguini', 'stumbled', 'thanks', 'help', 'little', 'chef', 'then', 'off', 'battle', 'Skinner', 'fact', 'due', 'legal', 'issues', 'as', 'well', 'battle', 'further', 'complicated', 'Skinner', 'perhaps', 'visions', 'grandeur', 'Gusteau', 'brand', 'wishes', 'enter', 'microwave', 'burrito', 'market', 'other', 'things', 'fact', 'Linguini', 'fame', 'Gusteau', 'name', 'carried', 'so', 'long.Written', 'Brad', 'Bird', 'Jan', 'Pinkman', 'Ratatouille', 'amazingly', 'well', 'done', 'animated', 'film', 'are', 'certainly', 'times', 'adult', 'almost', 'forget', 'are', 'watching', 'children', 'movie', 'story', 'line', 'film', 'creative', 'fun', 'was', 'never', 'time', 'film', 'viewer', 'could', 'become', 'bored', 'what', 'going', 'on.Ratatouille', 'was', 'nominated', 'ended', 'up', 'winning', '2008', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Animated', 'Feature', 'Year', 'surprise', 'why', 'case', 'movie', 'amazingly', 'well', 'done', 'animated', 'work', 'fun', 'watch', 'impressive', 'view', 'terms', 'effort', 'paid', 'detail', 'evidenced', 'film.This', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'ideal', 'family', 'movie', 'night', 'film', 'certainly', 'would', 'appeal', 'members', 'family', 'young', 'old', 'most', 'Disney-Pixar', 'films', 'film', 'seemed', 'be', 'flawless', 'terms', 'production', 'animation', 'was', 'nothing', 'top', 'notch.Even', 'are', 'scared', 'rats', 'Ratatouille', 'viewer', 'great', 'film', 'perhaps', 'more', 'likable', 'lovable', 'side', 'rats', 'perhaps', 'have', 'never', 'experienced', 'now', 'ever', 'see', 'actual', 'rat', 'having', 'piece', 'gruyere', 'matched', 'nicely', 'cabernet', 'sauvignon', 'will', 'be', 'hard', 'not', 'think', 'amazing', 'things', 'creature', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'concoct', 'kitchen', 'only', 'given', 'chance']",N/A
1100600,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B000VBJEEG,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[1, 1]","An astonishingly unconventional plot brings audiences to the streets of Paris where an anthropomorphic rat aids a floundering chef in cooking superlative cuisines in Pixar's Ratatouille. Thanks to director Brad Bird and his masterful direction, we're sucked into this exquisite story. With breathtaking animation as only Pixar can provide, nonstop comedy, James Bond-esque chase sequences, and wildly caricatured characters, Ratatouille is easily one of the best films of the summer.Remy the rat (Patton Oswalt) has an unusually refined sense of smell and taste and quickly aspires to eat only the finest foods as opposed to rifling through garbage and stealing food like his family regularly does. His father warns him of the dangers of humans (they are dangerous to rats as well as merfolk) but during a rapid escape from their compromised home, Remy is separated and lost down the unforgiving tunnels of a sewer. When he finally clamors to the top, guided by his role model's ghostlike guiding spirit (the late, great Chef Gusteau) he realizes he's in Paris and right next to Gusteau's five-star restaurant. Determined to live his dreams of becoming a chef, he saves a recently hired, bumbling garbage boy named Linguini (Lou Romano) from disaster and embarrassment, and forms an unlikely partnership. Remy puppeteers Linguini (while hiding under his toque) making him appear to be a talented chef. Linguini's suspicious and conniving boss Skinner (Ian Holm) and the specter-like food critic Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole) are the only two who stand in their way of living their dreams and proving to themselves and their families how the most unusual circumstances can lead to success - and that anyone can cook.A classic example of Pixar's signature ability to select the most inspiringly unique stories as well as to throw conventionality out the window, Ratatouille makes use of extreme contrasts in its principal ideas. A rat, typically despised - especially in the kitchen - unites with a human to live out his dreams as a chef. The plausibility of this contrary scheme is low, but with the amazing character development we're sucked into the fictitious world that is so vividly painted onscreen. On an unrelated note, Pixar once again tacks on an animated short film to the beginning of the feature, this time a science fiction piece entitled ""Lifted"", which beautifully sets up the mood for Ratatouille's stellar story.Several noteworthy contrasts and singular ideas surface consistently throughout Ratatouille. Similar to Toy Story, in which the toys don't allow humans to notice their anthropomorphic qualities, the rats in Ratatouille keep their actions out of sight. They squeak when they talk (from human perspective), yet they ride boats during an escape, and Remy can read books. Are they unable to achieve human characteristics when humans aren't present? Technical contrasts exist in the editing and cinematography, including humorous transitions from Colette's face to that of Ego's malicious grimace, and rapid night-to-day cuts. Often overlooked and yet perhaps the most stunning aspect of the film is the way the camera moves: dollies, pans, and chases that carefully follow movements perfectly mimic the way a camera is used in live action, yet there are no real cameras at all. This perfect mimicry of actual cameras allows the viewer to follow the events of the CG characters exactly as if they were real, which of course adds to the precision and naturalism.All of the visual aspects of the film are absolutely praiseworthy. The photorealism of textures and environments continue to be near perfection and, in typical Disney fashion, the lead characters are crafted as caricatures and have exaggerated cartoon qualities. Gusteau, Linguini, Colette and the rest of the kitchen staff are all creatively skewed from standard human dimensions and proportions, while the inanimate object all remain realistically fashioned. But this familiar contrast in animated films helps emphasize the nonstop comedy and cheerful tone that permeates every scene. And most often the comical scenes involve a frantic, fast-paced chase through sea, land and air, much like James Bond's notorious opening sequence stunts. Director Brad Bird's tight direction keeps the action as intense and unpredictable as the jokes are funny.Full of wonderfully inventive ideas, from placing a rat in the kitchen, using Gusteau's spirit as a guide (who regularly admits to being a mere figment of Remy's imagination), to the wonderfully caricatured cast, Pixar has itself another winner. Despite the unexplained language barriers and farfetched plot, this delightfully delicious film doesn't ever become too preachy or too immature and always maintains a high level of pure entertainment.- Mike Massie",4,Ratatouille Movie Review,1183334400,"07 2, 2007",2007,4788,"['astonishingly', 'unconventional', 'plot', 'brings', 'audiences', 'streets', 'Paris', 'where',

1100602,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000VBJEEG,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[5, 7]","Anytime Pixar releases a new film, the question is: Have they done it again? They have raised the bar so high with their string of inventive, imaginative, beautifully animated films they are now in competition with themselves. So when ""Cars"" came out, it was a fun film, but it was no ""Toy Story"". When I told a co-worker that I had seen the sneak preview of Pixar's newest ""Ratatouile"", they immediately said, ""Don't tell me they did it again?""Yes, they have done it again. ""Ratatouile"" is a great animated film. It isn't their funniest film, but it is one of their best. It seems like director Brad Bird is trying to create a more film like animated feature. His film just happens to be animated and have talking rats.""Ratatouile"" is fantastic. And for many reasons.First and foremost is director Brad Bird. Bird worked for a while on ""The Simpsons"" and then went on to direct an animated film called ""The Iron Giant"". ""Giant"" tells the story of a young boy who finds a robot who looks like he was transported from a 50s Sci-Fi film. Because of this, the film has a decidedly retro look and appears very traditionally animated. As a result, Warner Bros. buried the film and it never achieved the audience it deserved. Then Bird moved on to Pixar and directed ""The Incredibles"". In one word: Incredible. This was the animated version of a James Bond film and a super hero film all rolled into one. Great characters. Great animation. Great story. ""The Incredibles"" is one of my favorite films of all time.Now Bird returns with this very different film that shares one similarity. In both cases, Bird seems to be making films that just happen to be animated. He crafts the story and the characters with such remarkable ability, making them appear as though they are human actors. And I think this will help his films transcend and become classics remembered by future generations.The beauty of ""Ratatouile"" is that it takes our misconceptions, our prejudices and some of the reality of life in Paris, and a gourmet restaurant, and combines them into a very amusing mix. It continues the Pixar tradition of building real worlds, real environments for these characters, making the films a little more genuine in the long run. As with all Pixar films, the animation is stunning, but in ""Ratatouile"", they have gone even one step further. The backgrounds, the textures, the appliances, Remy's fur, are almost photo realistic. Even the facial expressions and mannerisms of the characters seem real and if they didn't look like cartoon characters, you might think they were human.Remy (comedian Patton Oswalt, who has a lot of television work to his credit) is a rat who lives with his father and the rest of their large clan, in the French countryside. While his father, his brother, Emile (Peter Sohn) and the rest of the clan are happy to eat garbage, Remy aspires to something greater. He sneaks into the cottage of an old woman and learns of a famous chef, Gusteau (Brad Garrett, TV's ""Everybody Loves Raymond""). The chef is on the old woman's television set and his bestselling cookbook, ""Everyone Can Cook"" is on her shelf. Remy steals the cookbook and one thing leads to another and he ends up in Paris. When he arrives at Gusteau's, the famous chef has passed away from heartbreak; one of his famed five stars was recently taken away by the evil food critic, Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole). But the famous chef appears as Remy's alter ego when the rat gets trapped in the kitchen. Linguini (Lou Romano) is hired to be the new garbage boy despite the misgivings of the new head chef Skinner (Ian Holm) who regards the boy suspiciously. After Linguini ruins a pot of soup, Remy can't resist sneaking up to the pot and creating a masterpiece. But Linguini is given credit for the soup and the garbage boy soon realizes the rat made the soup and they work out a deal. But Skinner becomes suspicious and is convinced there is a rat. Linguini meets the one female chef in the kitchen, Collette (Janeane Garofolo) and she resents that she has to teach the new boy about the kitchen. When word of the new soup meets Ego's ears, he decides to review the restaurant again, causing everyone to panic.Incredibly, there is a lot more to the story that I haven't even touched.I wouldn't recognize Patton Oswalt if he was standing directly in front of me, but he does a great job providing the voice for Remy. He has a lot of television work to his credit and has been around a while. Oswalt brings a quiet angst to the role; Remy wants to be so much more than he is and all of the people around him aren't willing to support this, so he becomes frustrated. He knows there is more to the world and it is inconceivable that his family isn't interested in finding out more.Throughout the film, he talks to Gusteau, who becomes his alter ego. Their conversations are funny and help to create one of the most unusual animated duos to appear on screen in some time. Gusteau actually wants to help Remy become a chef and this rings very true. For a famous chef, who wrote a cookbook called ""Anyone Can Cook"", it would be natural for him to want to help anyone or anything that even expressed a desire.Brad Garrett is great as Gusteau. It takes a lot of work to even identify the voice as Garrett, and really the tell is the deep timbre of Gusteau's voice. Garrett doesn't play the role like a French Caricature, which helps to balance the film a little. He is merely very enthusiastic and the enthusiasm shows throughout.Part of the brilliance of ""Ratatouille"" is how the film plays with both the stereotypes and misconceptions of the French and some of the more realistic aspects of life in Paris. The film begins with a prologue setting up the status of Gusteau. A news story talks about his life, his bestselling cookbook and his famed restaurant. It also introduces the food critic, Anton Ego, when the story reveals how Gusteau's restaurant received five stars, then had one taken away. I have seen many articles about famous French chefs who have become suicidal when one of their Michelin stars was taken away. This is the type of detail the little kids in the audience would never get, but some of the adults might, and it helps to make the experience more interesting for them.Because Gusteau is so natural and seems so realistic, this provides a nice counterpoint to Skinner, the sous chef who takes over when Gusteau dies. Skinner, played by Ian Holm, is the complete opposite of Gusteau. Nervous his new empire might be taken away, scheming to make more money, and going a little crazy because he believes Linguini has a rat in his toque, Holm plays the character very broad but it works very well. He has the energy level and instincts of Wile E. Coyote. It is a fun performance and the character is great.Janeane Garofolo plays Collette, the one female chef in the kitchen. Because of this, she is very tough and protective of her position. So, naturally, she resents having to baby-sit the new chef. But she also becomes Linguini's friend and ally, until she feels she has been betrayed. It is a nice performance, one that could easily be found in a non-animated film. Because it is fairly realistic, it helps ""Ratatouile"" seem more believable, more natural.The big surprise for me was Peter O'Toole. I didn't realize the actor was even involved and it took me a while to place him as the food critic Anton Ego. O'Toole brings every nuance of his voice to the evil, stern character. Tall, with a hawk like nose, Ego walks into a room and expects to be noticed, but he doesn't acknowledge anyone who does notice him, which makes him all the more menacing. O'Toole does a great job of giving the character a lot of depth and menace. There is a brilliant scene late in the film which helps to make the character all the more believable.There are so many levels at work in ""Ratatouile"" I have only managed to scratch the surface. Brian Dennehy plays one of the characters and John Ratzenberger also provides a voice. It wouldn't be a Pixar film without him, would it?""Ratatouile"" is a great animated film.As is the tradition with Pixar films, they are showing an animated short before the main feature. ""Lifted"", directed by Gary Rydstrom (an Oscar Winning sound engineer many times over for many feature films) tells the story of an alien cadet who is trying to pass one of his tests. The test? To extract a sleeping farmer from his bed in his farmhouse and bring him up to the spaceship. His instructor looks on with great displeasure. This is a hilarious delight and a great way to set the mood for the rest of the film.",5,"""Ratatouille"" Continues The Pixar Tradition: Another Masterpiece",1182816000,"06 26,

1100603,A3KJ6JAZPH382D,B000VBJEEG,"Tim Brough ""author and music buff""","[0, 0]","Rats! That is what the folks at Pixar threw at us for the delightful ""Ratatouille,"" the anti-Willard of kids movies. Filmed in a sweeping style (the visions of Paris after dark are almost dreamlike in their beauty), the story of Remy, the Rat who would be Chef, is the kind of Disney ""can-do"" movie that they've been making for years. But this is easily the best they've done since the originalToy Story.Remy has to overcome his upbringing and his species after he gets separated from his clan. A series of events leads him to Linguini, kitchen help at a famous but downtrodden French Restaurant. From there, Remy and Linguini form an alliance and taste success. But they still have a big obstacle to overcome, food critic Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole, ""Ratatouille's"" only celebrity voice-casting). How they manage to warm his heart and save the day is fun and funny, only leaning into mean-spiritedness once or twice. (Unnecessary French bashing, Remy's Dad seems too simple a character).The animation is way beyond average. Remy is fluid and lifelike...conveying more with a shrug or shimmy than most live critters (including two legged ones). His ride down the stream is breathtaking, as are the visions of Paris. (For Purists: there's a disclaimer at the end of the movie that 100% Animation - not motion capture, etc - was used to create ""Ratatouille."") The story of being who you are despite what others expect is positive, even coming from a hoard of Rats. What they have in ""Ratatouille"" that gets a bit different is that there isn't any stunt casting, the cast doesn't suddenly break into song, and the language doesn't revert into cliche of the day.

1100604,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B000VBJEEG,Tim Janson,"[1, 1]","I found there to be quite a difference between Ratatouille and the last Disney DVD I reviewed, ""Meet the Robinsons."" While they were both very good, ""Meet the Robinsons"" was a bit more cerebral and I thought its concepts of time travel may have been a bit much for younger kids to grasp. On the other hand, Ratatouille is a true screwball comedy, almost more in the spirit of old Warner Brothers Daffy Duck and Bugs Bunny cartoons. It's a pure slapstick farce, and kids will have no problem laughing their heads off here.Comedian Patton Oswalt shines in the lead role as Remy, a rat with an acute sense of smell and a taste for fine food. When Remy and his clan are ran out of their previous home, Remy ends up in downtown Paris at the restaurant of recently deceased chef Auguste Gusteau (Brad Garrett). Gusteau's will calls for his restaurant to go to a family heir and if none are found, it passes to the head chef, Skinner. Of course, he does have an unknown heir working right in the restaurant. Linguini (Lou Romano) is a shy young man without the slightest bit of skills in the kitchen. That all changes when he meets Remy who hides under Linguini's hat and controls his movements to create dishes that thrill the customers at Gusteau's and rankle Skinner who is determined to find out his secrets. Gusteau's spirit visits Remy, providing sage advice along the way.While Linguini is learning skills from chef Colette (Janeane Garofalo), Remy runs into conflict with his father Django (Brian Dennehy) who shows in rather graphic fashion, what happens when rats get too close to humans. He wants Remy to return to the clan but Remy is determined to help Linguini win the restaurant from the evil Skinner. Peter O' Toole almost steals the film near the end playing a food critic named Anton Ego who is the scourge of fine dining. His column can make or break a restaurant. And now Linguini has to cook for him without a staff and without Remy.No offense to Patton Oswalt, but he was born to voice a rat. His light, enthusiastic voice was the perfect match for Remy. I laughed out loud several times when Remy was under Linguini's hat and pulling his hair to drive him like a horse. There's also a great scene when the Health Inspector walks into the kitchen to see hundreds of rats scurrying about, preparing dinner. Peter Sohn as Remy's brother Emile provided further comic relief as a fattened rat who never saw a piece of trash he wouldn't eat. All of the voice talent...even the usually annoying Garofalo...turned in strong performances. The only curious scene involved Skinner trying to get Linguini to talk by getting him drunk on wine. That's an odd scene for a Disney who normally likes to avoid the remotest chance of controversy.There are two weaknesses to the film and DVD. First, at 1 hour and 51 minutes, it's probably too long by about 15 minutes I think. It's hard to keep the interest of young kids for close to two hours. Secondly, the special features on the DVD were light. There is a 13 minute interview with the writer and producer, three deleted scenes, an instruction with Remy on rats as your friend, and a short animated film called ""Lifted"". A bit skimpy for a Disney DVD.",4,Not great but fun!,1208131200,"04 14, 2008",2008,3202,"['found', 'there', 'be', 'quite', 'difference', 'Ratatouille', 'last', 'Disney', 'DVD', 'reviewed', 'Meet', 'Robinsons', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'Meet', 'Robinsons', 'was', 'bit', 'more', 'cerebral', 'thought', 'concepts', 'time', 'travel', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'much', 'younger', 'kids', 'grasp', 'other', 'hand', 'Ratatouille', 'true', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'almost', 'more', 'spirit', 'old', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'Daffy', 'Duck', 'Bugs', 'Bunny', 'cartoons', 'pure', 'slapstick', 'farce', 'kids', 'will', 'have', 'problem', 'laughing', 'heads', 'here.Comedian', 'Patton', 'Oswalt', 'shines', 'lead', 'role', 'Remy', 'rat', 'acute', 'sense', 'smell', 'taste', 'fine', 'food', 'When', 'Remy', 'clan', 'are', 'ran', 'previous', 'home', 'Remy', 'up', 'downtown', 'Paris', 'restaurant', 'recently', 'deceased', 'chef', 'Auguste', 'Gusteau', 'Brad', 'Garrett', 'Gusteau', 'will', 'calls', 'restaurant', 'go', 'family', 'heir', 'none', 'are', 'found', 'head', 'chef', 'Skinner', 'course', 'have', 'unknown', 'heir', 'working', 'right', 'restaurant', 'Linguini', 'Lou', 'Romano', 'shy', 'young', 'man', 'slightest', 'bit', 'skills', 'kitchen', 'changes', 'when', 'Remy', 'who', 'Linguini', 'hat', 'movements', 'create', 'dishes', 'thrill', 'customers', 'Gusteau', 'rankle', 'Skinner', 'who', 'determined', 'find', 'out', 'secrets', 'Gusteau', 'spirit', 'visits', 'Remy', 'providing', 'sage', 'advice', 'way.While', 'Linguini', 'learning', 'skills', 'chef', 'Colette', 'Janeane', 'Garofalo', 'Remy', 'conflict', 'father', 'Django', 'Brian', 'Dennehy', 'who', 'rather', 'graphic', 'fashion', 'what', 'when', 'rats', 'get', 'too', 'close', 'humans', 'Remy', 'return', 'clan', 'Remy', 'determined', 'help', 'Linguini', 'win', 'restaurant', 'evil', 'Skinner', 'Peter', 'O', 'Toole', 'almost', 'film', 'end', 'playing', 'food', 'critic', 'named', 'Anton', 'Ego', 'who', 'scourge', 'fine', 'dining', 'column', 'can', 'make', 'break', 'restaurant', 'now', 'Linguini', 'cook', 'staff', 'Remy.No', 'offense', 'Patton', 'Oswalt', 'was', 'born', 'voice', 'rat', 'light', 'enthusiastic', 'voice', 'was', 'perfect', 'match', 'Remy', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'several', 'times', 'when', 'Remy', 'was', 'Linguini', 'hat', 'pulling', 'hair', 'drive', 'horse', 'also', 'great', 'scene', 'when', 'Health', 'Inspector', 'walks', 'kitchen', 'see', 'hundreds', 'rats', 'scurrying', 'preparing', 'dinner', 'Peter', 'Sohn', 'Remy', 'brother', 'Emile', 'provided', 'further', 'comic', 'relief', 'fattened', 'rat', 'who', 'never', 'saw', 'piece', 'trash', 'would', ""n't"", 'eat', 'voice', 'talent', 'even', 'usually', 'annoying', 'Garofalo', 'turned', 'strong', 'performances', 'only', 'curious', 'scene', 'involved', 'Skinner', 'trying', 'get', 'Linguini', 'talk', 'getting', 'drunk', 'wine', 'odd', 'scene', 'Disney', 'who', 'normally', 'avoid', 'remotest', 'chance', 'controversy.There', 'are', 'two', 'weaknesses', 'film', 'DVD', 'First', '1', 'hour', '51', 'minutes', 'probably', 'too', 'long', '15', 'minutes', 'think', 'hard', 'keep', 'interest', 'young', 'kids', 'close', 'two', 'hours', 'Secondly', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'were', 'light', '13', 'minute', 'interview', 'writer', 'producer', 'three', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'instruction', 'Remy', 'rats', 'friend', 'short', 'animated', 'film', 'called', 'Lifted', 'bit', 'skimpy', 'Disney', 'DVD']",N/A
1100605,A2UNMXBJSVIXFB,B000VBJEEG,Tony Khamvongsouk,"[2, 2]","Movie - 5.0Prior to viewing this movie, I hadn't seen any Disney/Pixar films since Toy Story. I know, I'm out of the loop, but thank goodness I found this gem in Ratatouille. Never had I been so brought back to the joys of childhood where I could watch a movie and have it bring about so many forms of sheer joy and innocent emotion and feel like I actually was a kid again. But at the same time, I found a very subtle maturity to the story and characters of this movie as well. The amazement of cooking and food, the exotic backdrop of Paris, the silly, yet serious interactions of a rat and his handler, then the denouement of a hard-nosed food critic who rediscovered himself and reasserted the happiness of which only food can do to a person; all of these elements make for a very light-hearted comedy about what it means to find something in life that you can dedicate yourself to, pursue, and enjoy to your heart's content. In particular, I was every impressed with the script and screenplay. Remy's conscience being played by an imaginary version of Gusteau was brilliant in studying his overall character as the audience gets a clear, basic understanding of what Remy is thinking to himself. Linguini is a ""lovable loser"" archetype that tries so hard, but always manages to bumble things. There's a sort of coyness that makes him fun to root for and his ""ambitions"" are commendable, kind of like an ""everyman,"" so I really enjoyed watching him as well. Then, there are all of the other supporting characters in Chef Skinner, Anton Ego, Collette, Remy's family, etc. that ultimately make the film one very enjoyable experience. Top that off with a great soundtrack by Michael Giacchino who captures much of the same exoticism that makes Paris so intriguing, and you've got this lovely Oscar-wining feature.Video - 5.0Being a direct digital transfer of CG to BD, the result is flawless. Colors are vibrant with lots of yellows and golds accentuating the color palette of the kitchen at Gusteau's. Black levels and contrast are perfect in revealing all the fine detailed lines from the hugeness of Linguini's nose down to the tiny hairs and whiskers of Remy and his clan. Images are always sharp, and the image itself provides for some great example of depth and dimensionality. There are no signs of aliasing, color banding, or any other hiccups making for some beautiful shots of photography amongst the backdrop of Paris, and even some of the inner housing of Linguini's apartment, the kitchen, and the sewers. There also appear to be no signs of artificial enhancement or manipulation, making this a transfer as perfect as you can get and ready to be showcased for all.Audio - 5.0Using an uncompressed PCM 5.1 track, Ratatouille is equally as stunning as it's video counterpart. Dialogue is clear, and directionality is particularly precise during kitchen scenes with the clanging of pots and pans, whooshing of flames, and dribbles of liquid all over the place. Music accompanies the sound effects perfectly and immerses the viewer with some wonderful and adventurous melodies that really compliment the story telling, never overdoing itself or intruding over the dialogue. LFEs are most prominent during musical numbers and when things are being chopped up. There really are no flaws with the general sound design and placement and should be enjoyable by the ears of any.Extras - 4.5Personally, I found the extras to be very fun and informative. But the only gripe I have is that they didn't put the ""making of"" featurettes on as separate 25GB disc by itself. Instead of SD specials, they could've well been HD. Other than that, though, they're all very enjoyable. The Pixar animated shorts are always a nice addition, while the ""rat history"" as narrated by Remy and Emile served as a cute parody of how rats could be thought of under a different light (not that it'll ever happen since rats aren't as smart as this, but the effort is appreciated). Then of course there's the production segments, which continue to amaze me in how hard it really is to produce films of this caliber. I highly respect and give thanks to all the people involved in these types of projects.Overall - 5.0The only thing that would've made this release any better is an extra disc specifically reserved for the special features. But other than that, it's an extreme delight to have watched this film for its cheery and lovable narrative about personal passion and the following of one's dreams. With immaculate A/V quality and an excellent set of extras and special features, I can't recommend this title enough for both kids and adults.",5,Ratatouille (Blu-ray),1233273600,"01 30, 2009",2009,4625,"['Movie', '5.0Prior', 'viewing', 'movie', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Disney/Pixar', 'films', 'Toy', 'Story', 'know', ""'m"", 'loop', 'thank', 'goodness', 'found', 'gem', 'Ratatouille', 'Never', 'had', 'been', 'so', 'brought', 'back', 'joys', 'childhood', 'where', 'could', 'watch', 'movie', 'have', 'bring', 'about', 'so', 'many', 'forms', 'sheer', 'joy', 'innocent', 'emotion', 'feel', 'actually', 'was', 'kid', 'again', 'same', 'time', 'found', 'very', 'subtle', 'maturity', 'story', 'characters', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'amazement', 'cooking', 'food', 'exotic', 'backdrop', 'Paris', 'silly', 'yet', 'serious', 'interactions', 'rat', 'handler', 'then', 'denouement', 'hard-nosed', 'food', 'critic', 'who', 'rediscovered', 'reasserted', 'happiness', 'only', 'food', 'can', 'do', 'person', 'elements', 'make', 'very', 'light-hearted', 'comedy', 'what', 'find', 'something', 'life', 'can', 'dedicate', 'pursue', 'enjoy', 'heart', 'content', 'particular', 'was', 'impressed', 'script', 'screenplay', 'Remy', 'conscience', 'being', 'played', 'imaginary', 'version', 'Gusteau', 'was', 'brilliant', 'studying', 'overall', 'character', 'audience', 'clear', 'basic', 'understanding', 'what', 'Remy', 'thinking', 'Linguini', 'lovable', 'loser', 'archetype', 'so', 'hard', 'always', 'bumble', 'things', 'sort', 'coyness', 'fun', 'root', 'ambitions', 'are', 'commendable', 'kind', 'everyman', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'as', 'well', 'Then', 'are', 'other', 'supporting', 'characters', 'Chef', 'Skinner', 'Anton', 'Ego', 'Collette', 'Remy', 'family', 'etc', 'ultimately', 'make', 'film', 'one', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'experience', 'Top', 'off', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'Michael', 'Giacchino', 'who', 'much', 'same', 'exoticism', 'Paris', 'intriguing', ""'ve"", 'got', 'lovely', 'Oscar-wining', 'feature.Video', '5.0Being', 'direct', 'digital', 'transfer', 'CG', 'BD', 'result', 'flawless', 'Colors', 'are', 'vibrant', 'lots', 'yellows', 'golds', 'accentuating', 'color', 'palette', 'kitchen', 'Gusteau', 'Black', 'levels', 'contrast', 'are', 'perfect', 'revealing', 'fine', 'detailed', 'lines', 'hugeness', 'Linguini', 'nose', 'tiny', 'hairs', 'whiskers', 'Remy', 'clan', 'Images', 'are', 'always', 'sharp', 'image', 'great', 'example', 'depth', 'dimensionality', 'are', 'signs', 'aliasing', 'color', 'banding', 'other', 'hiccups', 'making', 'beautiful', 'shots', 'photography', 'backdrop', 'Paris', 'even', 'inner', 'housing', 'Linguini', 'apartment', 'kitchen', 'sewers', 'also', 'appear', 'be', 'signs', 'artificial', 'enhancement', 'manipulation', 'making', 'transfer', 'as', 'perfect', 'can', 'get', 'ready', 'be', 'showcased', 'all.Audio', '5.0Using', 'uncompressed', 'PCM', '5.1', 'track', 'Ratatouille', 'equally', 'as', 'stunning', 'video', 'counterpart', 'Dialogue', 'clear', 'directionality', 'particularly', 'precise', 'kitchen', 'scenes', 'clanging', 'pots', 'pans', 'whooshing', 'flames', 'dribbles', 'liquid', 'place', 'Music', 'sound', 'effects', 'perfectly', 'viewer', 'wonderful', 'adventurous', 'melodies', 'really', 'compliment', 'story', 'telling', 'never', 'overdoing', 'intruding', 'dialogue', 'LFEs', 'are', 'most', 'prominent', 'musical', 'numbers', 'when', 'things', 'are', 'being', 'chopped', 'up', 'really', 'are', 'flaws', 'general', 'sound', 'design', 'placement', 'should', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'ears', 'any.Extras', '4.5Personally', 'found', 'extras', 'be', 'very', 'fun', 'informative', 'only', 'gripe', 'have', 'did', ""n't"", 'put', 'making', 'featurettes', 'separate', '25GB', 'disc', 'Instead', 'SD', 'specials', 'could', ""'ve"", 'well', 'been', 'HD', 'Other', 'though', ""'re"", 'very', 'enjoyable', 'Pixar', 'animated', 'shorts', 'are', 'always', 'nice', 'addition', 'rat', 'history', 'narrated', 'Remy', 'Emile', 'served', 'cute', 'parody', 'how', 'rats', 'could', 'be', 'thought', 'different', 'light', 'not', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'happen', 'rats', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'smart', 'effort', 'appreciated', 'Then', 'course', 'production', 'segments', 'continue', 'amaze', 'how', 'hard', 'really', 'produce', 'films', 'caliber', 'highly', 'respect', 'give', 'thanks', 'people', 'involved', 'types', 'projects.Overall', '5.0The', 'only', 'thing', 'would', ""'ve"", 'made', 'release', 'better', 'extra', 'disc', 'specifically', 'reserved', 'special', 'features', 'other', 'extreme', 'delight', 'have', 'watched', 'film', 'cheery', 'lovable', 'narrative', 'personal', 'passion', 'following', 'one', 'dreams', 'immaculate', 'A/V', 'quality', 'excellent', 'set', 'extras', 'special', 'features', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'title', 'enough', 'kids', 'adults']",N/A

That is, you don't need a big name or catchy music to make a great animation. All you need is believable characters you can relate to and an interesting story driven by them even though one of the characters is actually a most incredible creation -- a French gourmet rat named Remy, who goes to Paris and establishes friendship with a shy boy working in the kitchen of a (formerly) five-star restaurant.Brad Bird, who scored a one-two punch by giving us two fantastic animations, anmely ""The Iron Giant"" and ""The Incredibles,"" has created one of the most charming characters in the movie history in Remy, a rat who loves cooking more than anything. The lovable rat's colorful facial and bodily expressions of emotions are always amusing to see, with dynamic movements that only gifted animators can create.

1100615,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B000VBJEEG,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[6, 6]","RATATOUILLE is a Pixar picture.  That's all that one needs to know.  However, if you want some details about the film and some other (though highly unnecessary) reasons to watch the movie, keep reading.RATATOUILLE is a story about a French country bumpkin, named Remy (Patton Oswalt) who discovers that he not only has a nose and taste for fine food, but that he can cook great meals as well.  The only problem is that Remy is a rat.  Most people don't even like rats and since they carry and spread more diseases than almost any other animal in the world, it's not usually healthy to have one near a kitchen.  Remy finds himself literally swept away from the country to the streets of Paris.  He sneaks into the restaurant that is named and was once owned by a famous cook who Remy used to watch on tv and who believed that ""anyone can cook"".  Of course, no one actually believes that and after being caught, the kitchen's new scullery boy, Linguini (Lou Romano), is sent to drown Remy in the river.  Of course, Linguini can't bring himself to do it and when realizing that Remy can understand him and that he can cook, too, he brings Remy home.  A partnership is formed and the duo soon become the talk of Paris.  But the current chef and owner of the restaurant hates Linguini and smells a rat.  He tries to find out if there's someway he can keep the shining star from rising any higher, but his plans are nothing compared to the trouble that a deepening relationship between a rat and a man and the kindness that a rat shows towards his family.The film was written and co-directed by Brad Bird, a former animator of THE SIMPSONS and the guy who wrote and directed THE INCREDIBLES.You really shouldn't need any more reasons to see this movie, but I'll give you some more.  The film is mostly set in Paris and RATATOUILLE presents some of the most authentic animation of Paris ever seen on film.  If you've never been to Paris, you'll actually come away with a feel for the city after seeing the movie.  I know because I've never been to Paris and after the film some friends I know who have been there said, ""Now you have an idea of what Paris is like.""  Besides Patton Oswalt and Lou Romano, the movie also features the vocal talents of Ian Holm, Brian Dennehy, Peter O'Toole, Brad Garrett, Janeane Garofalo, Will Arnett, and John Ratzenberger.Lastly, the other reason you should see RATATOUILLE is for the water animation sequence.  Remy is separated from his family and taken to Paris by the waterways in the streams and sewers that run from the countryside into the city.  I knew I was watching a cartoon during this sequence.  I kept telling myself that over and over and over. ""This is animation.""  The reason I did that is because the water looks so real.  It looked so real that there were times that it literally looks as if it is splashing off the screen.  Even if this wasn't a Pixar picture or had any of the other fine things going for it, RATATOUILLE would be worth seeing for that one sequence alone.Toddlers and younger kids will probably be enthralled with the colors.  Older children will probably love the physical comedy.  Adults will enjoy the story and the few allusions laid out for them throughout the picture.  RATATOUILLE truly is a picture for the whole family to enjoy and one of the best, if not the best animated film of 2007.",5,This Rat Smells Like Fine Food.,1189209600,"09 8, 2007",2007,3360,"['RATATOUILLE', 'Pixar', 'picture', 'one', 'know', 'However', 'want', 'details', 'film', 'other', 'highly', 'unnecessary', 'reasons', 'watch', 'movie', 'keep', 'reading.RATATOUILLE', 'story', 'French', 'country', 'bumpkin', 'named', 'Remy', 'Patton', 'Oswalt', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'nose', 'taste', 'fine', 'food', 'can', 'cook', 'great', 'meals', 'as', 'well', 'only', 'problem', 'Remy', 'rat', 'Most', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'rats', 'carry', 'spread', 'more', 'diseases', 'almost', 'other', 'animal', 'world', 'not', 'usually', 'healthy', 'have', 'one', 'kitchen', 'Remy', 'literally', 'swept', 'away', 'country', 'streets', 'Paris', 'restaurant', 'named', 'was', 'once', 'owned', 'famous', 'cook', 'who', 'Remy', 'used', 'watch', 'tv', 'who', 'believed', 'anyone', 'can', 'cook', 'course', 'one', 'actually', 'being', 'caught', 'kitchen', 'new', 'scullery', 'boy', 'Linguini', 'Lou', 'Romano', 'sent', 'drown', 'Remy', 'river', 'course', 'Linguini', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bring', 'do', 'when', 'realizing', 'Remy', 'can', 'understand', 'can', 'cook', 'too', 'Remy', 'home', 'partnership', 'formed', 'duo', 'soon', 'become', 'talk', 'Paris', 'current', 'chef', 'owner', 'restaurant', 'Linguini', 'rat', 'find', 'out', 'someway', 'can', 'keep', 'shining', 'star', 'rising', 'higher', 'plans', 'are', 'nothing', 'compared', 'trouble', 'deepening', 'relationship', 'rat', 'man', 'kindness', 'rat', 'family.The', 'film', 'was', 'written', 'co-directed', 'Brad', 'Bird', 'former', 'animator', 'THE', 'SIMPSONS', 'guy', 'who', 'wrote', 'directed', 'THE', 'INCREDIBLES.You', 'really', 'should', ""n't"", 'need', 'more', 'reasons', 'see', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'give', 'more', 'film', 'mostly', 'set', 'Paris', 'RATATOUILLE', 'most', 'authentic', 'animation', 'Paris', 'ever', 'seen', 'film', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'Paris', ""'ll"", 'actually', 'come', 'away', 'feel', 'city', 'seeing', 'movie', 'know', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'Paris', 'film', 'friends', 'know', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'said', 'Now', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'Paris', 'Patton', 'Oswalt', 'Lou', 'Romano', 'movie', 'also', 'vocal', 'talents', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'Brian', 'Dennehy', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'Brad', 'Garrett', 'Janeane', 'Garofalo', 'Will', 'Arnett', 'John', 'Ratzenberger.Lastly', 'other', 'reason', 'should', 'see', 'RATATOUILLE', 'water', 'animation', 'sequence', 'Remy', 'separated', 'family', 'taken', 'Paris', 'waterways', 'streams', 'sewers', 'run', 'countryside', 'city', 'knew', 'was', 'watching', 'cartoon', 'sequence', 'kept', 'telling', 'over', 'animation', 'reason', 'did', 'water', 'so', 'real', 'looked', 'so', 'real', 'were', 'times', 'literally', 'splashing', 'off', 'screen', 'Even', 'was', ""n't"", 'Pixar', 'picture', 'had', 'other', 'fine', 'things', 'going', 'RATATOUILLE', 'would', 'be', 'worth', 'seeing', 'one', 'sequence', 'alone.Toddlers', 'younger', 'kids', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'enthralled', 'colors', 'Older', 'children', 'will', 'probably', 'love', 'physical', 'comedy', 'Adults', 'will', 'enjoy', 'story', 'few', 'allusions', 'laid', 'out', 'picture', 'RATATOUILLE', 'truly', 'picture', 'whole', 'family', 'enjoy', 'one', 'best', 'not', 'best', 'animated', 'film', '2007']",N/A

Is it the best film of the year?  No, but it's the one with the greatest appeal, as nearly everyone will consider viewing it to be a positive experience.Ratatouille follows Remy, a curious rat who aspires to be more than a garbage thief.  Remy's acute sense of smell and appreciation for food attract him to the culinary arts.  By stealing what he can from a elderly homeowners appreciation for cooking shows and books, Remy becomes a devotee of one of France's most famous chefs, Auguste Gusteau'.  After Remy learns that Gusteau died years and he had been watching reruns of his television program, the little rat begins to be guided Ben Kenobi-like by the spirit of the dead chef.Following the spirit eventually leads him to Gusteau's former restaurant, which has been taken over by a artless capitalist who uses Gusteau's image to sell frozen burritos and corndogs.  By using a young kitchen worker as a medium, Remy tries to rebuild the reputation of Gusteau and return his restaurant to its glory.The resulting action is an often charming tale of a rat as much devoted to finding himself as achieving his goal.  Lots of laughs are found when his family shows up looking for handouts, and the chief antagonists (the owner and a food critic) create real dramatic moments of peril.  Remy is truly a film ""hero"", someone devoted to a cause that he believes will make the world a better place.  Although lacking the heart of the Toy Story films or the comic brilliance of the first Shrek, Ratatouille continues the trend of the animation renaissance that has provided some of the best films of the last decade.",5,Best Reviewed Film of 2007,1200355200,"01 15, 2008",2008,1796,"['Websites', 'track', 'positive', 'negative', 'reviews', 'major', 'critics', 'register', 'positive', 'score', 'least', '95', '%', 'Ratatouille', 'clearly', 'putting', 'top', 'films', '2007', 'best', 'film', 'year', 'No', 'one', 'greatest', 'appeal', 'nearly', 'everyone', 'will', 'consider', 'viewing', 'be', 'positive', 'experience.Ratatouille', 'Remy', 'curious', 'rat', 'who', 'be', 'more', 'garbage', 'thief', 'Remy', 'acute', 'sense', 'smell', 'appreciation', 'food', 'attract', 'culinary', 'arts', 'stealing', 'what', 'can', 'elderly', 'homeowners', 'appreciation', 'cooking', 'shows', 'books', 'Remy', 'devotee', 'one', 'France', 'most', 'famous', 'chefs', 'Auguste', 'Gusteau', 'Remy', 'Gusteau', 'died', 'years', 'had', 'been', 'watching', 'reruns', 'television', 'program', 'little', 'rat', 'be', 'guided', 'Ben', 'Kenobi-like', 'spirit', 'dead', 'chef.Following', 'spirit', 'eventually', 'Gusteau', 'former', 'restaurant', 'been', 'taken', 'over', 'artless', 'capitalist', 'who', 'Gusteau', 'image', 'sell', 'frozen', 'burritos', 'corndogs', 'using', 'young', 'kitchen', 'worker', 'medium', 'Remy', 'rebuild', 'reputation', 'Gusteau', 'return', 'restaurant', 'glory.The', 'resulting', 'action', 'often', 'charming', 'tale', 'rat', 'much', 'devoted', 'finding', 'achieving', 'goal', 'Lots', 'laughs', 'are', 'found', 'when', 'family', 'up', 'looking', 'handouts', 'chief', 'antagonists', 'owner', 'food', 'critic', 'create', 'real', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'peril', 'Remy', 'truly', 'film', 'hero', 'someone', 'devoted', 'cause', 'will', 'make', 'world', 'better', 'place', 'lacking', 'heart', 'Toy', 'Story', 'films', 'comic', 'brilliance', 'first', 'Shrek', 'Ratatouille', 'trend', 'animation', 'renaissance', 'provided', 'best', 'films', 'last', 'decade']",N/A

For some reason, this movie was one of the more overlooked Pixar releases yet.  If you haven't seen this movie, you're missing out on a beautiful, lush visual experience and a heartwarming and funny story.  Just all around movie magic.Disney's building a reputation of being the leader in quality Blu-ray releases.  They're of the first studios to embrace the more advanced Java-based features of Blu-ray.  Ratatouille is no exception.  Given a relatively barebones treatment on DVD, the Blu-ray disc has all the extensive goodies you'd expect from a special edition DVD.  At first glace, it seems like the feature list is the same, save for a game and something called Cine-explore.  Cine-explore is where all the goodies are hidden.  A fun little feature that allows you to seamlessly branch out to small featurettes and deleted scenes that become available during the course of the movie.  If you want to cut to the chase, you can access every featurette directly from the special features menu.  And there's a LOT of material there.From a technical perspective, the disc is brilliant.  A perfect video transfer lets you enjoy the beautiful art of Pixar in full HD resolution.  Absolutely no artifacting, compression issues, noise, or anything of the sort.

Our oldest is 14, we then have a 12, 9 and 4 year old, the baby can't enjoy a great movie yet, but in time I predict this will be a favorite.There were some very sophisticated jokes in this film, but there was enough slapstick to keep our younger boys entertained.  The story moved along with enough momentum to keep us all interested, but not so slow that the younger boys lose interest.  My older boys got a kick out of the premise, but the idea that we can be whatever we desire was not lost on them either, and isn't that a fine lesson for anyone to learn/and or remember?This was a great family movie, and I certainly think it lives up to Pixar's reputation, we are waiting with bated breath for Wall*E.Check this movie out...you won't be disappointed.",5,Love this movie!,1213056000,"06 10, 2008",2008,847,"['have', 'five', 'boys', 'are', 'always', 'looking', 'movies', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'enjoy', 'oldest', '14', 'then', 'have', '12', '9', '4', 'year', 'old', 'baby', 'ca', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'great', 'movie', 'yet', 'time', 'predict', 'will', 'be', 'favorite.There', 'were', 'very', 'sophisticated', 'jokes', 'film', 'was', 'enough', 'slapstick', 'keep', 'younger', 'boys', 'entertained', 'story', 'moved', 'along', 'enough', 'momentum', 'keep', 'interested', 'not', 'so', 'slow', 'younger', 'boys', 'lose', 'interest', 'older', 'boys', 'got', 'kick', 'premise', 'idea', 'can', 'be', 'desire', 'was', 'not', 'lost', ""n't"", 'fine', 'lesson', 'anyone', 'learn/and', 'remember', 'was', 'great', 'family', 'movie', 'certainly', 'think', 'up', 'Pixar', 'reputation', 'are', 'waiting', 'bated', 'breath', 'Wall*E.Check', 'movie', 'out', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed']",N/A
