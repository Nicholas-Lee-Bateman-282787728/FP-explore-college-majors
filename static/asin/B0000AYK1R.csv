We actually like &quot;The Lost Tribe&quot; better than &quot;Hooves&quot;; it is wackier and has more action - and Vikings! Blitzen's evil is delightful; his comparison of power and toast just cracked me up! There's more than a hint of Monty Python about &quot;Lost Tribe&quot; (the Viking flashback sequences are a key example).We found the US voice versions really flat and always listen to the UK versions; I think that the US version was done so that American audiences would have voices that they recognized, but Jane Horrocks' voice beats Britney Spears' voice hands down!One note - neither of the stories is actually about Christmas, but they ARE about reindeer and the North Pole. Our two year old loves the films, and we like them quite well, but what you think of them will depend on what you were expecting.",4,"&quot;Power, one of the few things nicer than toast&quot;",1071187200,"12 12, 2003",2003,910,"['Okay', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'great', 'Wallace', 'Gromit', 'films', 'are', 'pretty', 'funny', 'actually', 'quot', 'Lost', 'Tribe', 'quot', 'better', 'quot', 'Hooves', 'quot', 'wackier', 'more', 'action', 'Vikings', 'Blitzen', 'evil', 'delightful', 'comparison', 'power', 'toast', 'just', 'cracked', 'more', 'hint', 'Monty', 'Python', 'quot', 'Lost', 'Tribe', 'quot', 'Viking', 'flashback', 'sequences', 'are', 'key', 'example', 'found', 'US', 'voice', 'versions', 'really', 'flat', 'always', 'listen', 'UK', 'versions', 'think', 'US', 'version', 'was', 'done', 'so', 'American', 'audiences', 'would', 'have', 'voices', 'recognized', 'Jane', 'Horrocks', 'voice', 'beats', 'Britney', 'Spears', 'voice', 'hands', 'down', 'One', 'note', 'neither', 'stories', 'actually', 'Christmas', 'ARE', 'reindeer', 'North', 'Pole', 'two', 'year', 'old', 'films', 'like', 'quite', 'well', 'what', 'think', 'will', 'depend', 'were', 'expecting']",N/A

Both sets had a great, famous ensemble cast.Both stories are enduring stories that point to expectations, failure, and redemption.  While the stories involve North Pole themes and Christmas creatures from popular culture, these are not Christmas stories per se, i.e., if you want your kids to understand what Christmas is all about, you need to crack open that family heirloom and read Luke chapter 2 - it is still a riveting read nearly 2,000 years later.  ;-)In service,Rich",5,"Really cute!
