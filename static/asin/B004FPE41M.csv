If you are handicapped, cannot use your legs or have knee problems, you will be disappointed with this set of DVDs. Disc #2 is full of STANDING exercises, a lot of leg lifting, kicking and foot work. Disc #1 has only 3 segments with standing activities but a lot of lifting and kicking of the legs.I am also surprised by the introduction of props. First, there was hand weights (substitution of household items was suggested by somewhat impractical). Then came the long towel, obviously one of her own promotional products. I substituted a kitchen towel. On disc #2, you will suddenly be asked to...""Take out your large ball and small ball.""""What large ball and small ball?!!!"", was my first thought. Now, you are introduced to Mary Ann's 6 inch ball and 2 inch ball for about 1/4 of the disc. If you are going to require props, they should come with the disc...or a disclosure statement should be clearly stated with the DVDs...maybe on the cover of the DVD box.Fortunately, I did have hand weights and a towel of about the right size; so, I can use disc #1...at least 80% of it. As for disc #2, it is almost worthless for me, because I have limited use of my legs; and that disc is mostly standing and lower body activities...none of which I could do without extreme pain and great risk to myself.I didn't rate this set any lower than 3 stars, because most folks are not handicapped like myself. Mary Ann has a comfortable style of speaking and her instructions are easy to follow. The exercises are effective, IF you can do them. Unfortunately, I will be limited to using disc #1 from now on.",3,"Not always sitting, and you will need props.",1357948800,"01 12, 2013",2013,1641,"['Let', 'first', 'state', 'am', 'wheelchair', 'are', 'handicapped', 'can', 'not', 'use', 'legs', 'have', 'knee', 'problems', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'set', 'DVDs', 'Disc', '2', 'full', 'STANDING', 'exercises', 'lot', 'leg', 'lifting', 'kicking', 'foot', 'work', 'Disc', '1', 'only', '3', 'segments', 'standing', 'activities', 'lot', 'lifting', 'kicking', 'legs.I', 'am', 'also', 'surprised', 'introduction', 'props', 'First', 'was', 'hand', 'weights', 'substitution', 'household', 'items', 'was', 'suggested', 'somewhat', 'impractical', 'Then', 'came', 'long', 'towel', 'obviously', 'one', 'own', 'promotional', 'products', 'substituted', 'kitchen', 'towel', 'disc', '2', 'will', 'suddenly', 'be', 'asked', 'Take', 'out', 'large', 'ball', 'small', 'ball', 'What', 'large', 'ball', 'small', 'ball', 'was', 'first', 'thought', 'Now', 'are', 'introduced', 'Mary', 'Ann', '6', 'inch', 'ball', '2', 'inch', 'ball', '1/4', 'disc', 'are', 'going', 'require', 'props', 'should', 'come', 'disc', 'disclosure', 'statement', 'should', 'be', 'clearly', 'stated', 'DVDs', 'maybe', 'cover', 'DVD', 'box.Fortunately', 'did', 'have', 'hand', 'weights', 'towel', 'right', 'size', 'can', 'use', 'disc', '1', 'least', '80', '%', 'disc', '2', 'almost', 'worthless', 'have', 'limited', 'use', 'legs', 'disc', 'mostly', 'standing', 'lower', 'body', 'activities', 'none', 'could', 'do', 'extreme', 'pain', 'great', 'risk', 'myself.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'rate', 'set', 'lower', '3', 'stars', 'most', 'folks', 'are', 'not', 'handicapped', 'Mary', 'Ann', 'comfortable', 'style', 'speaking', 'instructions', 'are', 'easy', 'follow', 'exercises', 'are', 'effective', 'IF', 'can', 'do', 'Unfortunately', 'will', 'be', 'limited', 'using', 'disc', '1', 'now']",N/A
