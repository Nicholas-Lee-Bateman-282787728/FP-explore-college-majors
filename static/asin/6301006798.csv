I was less than impressed with this ""drug"" film, Robert Downey Jr., is over the top and Jami Gertz well who said she could act? The only performance worth a damn is Andrew McCarthy, he actually cares about his snobby, heartless friends, I always thought McCarthy was highly under-rated. This film goes absolutely nowhere, it's mudane, tries to be glamourous, and it's boring to look at. If you want a real and profound film about the ugly and dangerous world of drugs, I would check out Requiem for a Dream.

Although I was disappointed that it did not adhere to the novel (an updated version of ""Catcher in the Rye?""), I thought it was a helluva movie in its own right....  What sets this movie apart from other 80s teen flicks is this: it doens't end with some diabetes-inducing sweet Hollywood happy ending (and I think that is what really disturbs people).  True, the movie's main point seems to be ""Just Say No"".  But underneath lies other messages.  True friends are rare, there are way too many plastic people running around, it's way to easy to get stuck in a rut and sometimes life just really sucks.McCarthy does a fine job as the guy who tried to leave his go nowhere high school life behind and move on only to get sucked in again.  Gertz, never one of my favorites, abley portrays the spectator to her friend Julian's self-destruction and tries to ignore it even though she is heading in the same direction.  And Downey, Jr.?  Geez, he nails his part as Julian the well meaning dreamer who's on a bullet train to Dante's Inferno with really scary accuracy.On a lighter note: the classic Corvette McCarthy drives is sweet.  And watch for the scene in the basement dance club where the boom mic guy can be seen clear as day.A great flick with lots of substance.  If nothing else, get it for your kids.

242254,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6301006798,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","If I had never read Bret Easton Ellis' masterful novel from which this movie was spawned I may have actually enjoyed it for what it was, not what it was attempting to be.  The fact that `Less than Zero' happens to be one of my all time favorite novels made me so excited to dig up this film and give it a watch.  What I experienced though was pure shock, not in how good it was but in how unfaithful it was to the novel that inspired it.  The film is cleaned up and reformatted to such a degree that you lose the entire feeling and meaning behind the novel.  They didn't just alter an ending or add a subplot but they drastically changed the characters, their actions, their problems, their motives, their home life, their relationships.  Nothing is the same; except the names.So, I'll say that apart from the novel `Less than Zero' is a decent film with a promising prose.  On holiday from college, Clay Easton returns to LA to visit his family and friends; including his ex-girlfriend Blair.  Upon returning home, Clay uncovers that his former best friend Julian has a dangerous substance abuse problem and is in far too deep with local dealer Rip.  Clay and Blair decide to help their friend overcome this problem before it is too late.Like I said; the prose is promising...but it is not comparable to the novel.If you consider these spoilers I apologize, but I feel that if I don't at least point out the differences between this film and the novel than I am doing the reader a disservice.  Within the novel `everyone' has a substance abuse problem.  Julian is Clay's old dealer and while Julian does have more problems than he can bear up under, Clay could care less.  In fact, Clay just wants money and drugs for himself.  The point of Ellis' novel was to show the deterioration of teenage society in the 80's.  Kanievska's film adaptation sugarcoats everything to such a degree that you lose the purpose of the story.  I guess you can't really blame Kanievska as much as Harley Peyton who penned the screenplay.I know that when this film was made there was a different standard as far as what was acceptable to contain within a film, and so that was most likely the reason that some of the most memorable (albeit disturbing) moments of the novel were not included in the film; which is a shame because it was in those moments that the novel came to life in all its apathetic glory.  I can only imagine how masterfully this novel could be adapted, say in the hands of Darren Aronofsky.One thing that this film did though was give Robert Downey Jr. a canvas to paint his talent upon.  As the conflicted Julian Wells, Downey soars above the rest of the cast.  His performance is mature and natural (maybe his own substance abuse problems - which rumor has it sprung up around this time - may have had something to do with his spot-on portrayal).  James Spader also comes through with a magnetic and commanding performance as the ruthless Rip.  Anthony McCarthy is boring to me; not what Clay should have been.  Jami Gertz does a decent job as Blair, but she is not the greatest of actresses and is not very memorable.  Downey Jr. and Spader easily wipe the floor with everyone else attached to this film.In the end I can't recommend this film because it goes against my better judgment.  I know that a lot of people enjoyed this film; but I can only ascertain that they have not read the novel.  If they had then they would equally be disappointed at the missed opportunity for greatness.  `Less than Zero' is a decent film, but it is not the film it was supposed to be.  It is so far from what Ellis' original vision was that it does not deserve to carry the title.  If they had called this movie something else; anything else; then I could have added another star.

242255,A2WX1UESDOLXRE,6301006798,"Ashley Quinn ""Ash""","[3, 3]","I don't know what possessed me to watch this-- I rarely watch a movie that's on TV, I'm a big time buyer and a major renter. Since this movie was on a movie channel (no commercials, nothing cut out), I decided to watch it because I saw Robert Downey, Jr's. name in the credits. Watching this movie was worth it just for his performance alone. I can't think of a movie that he disappointed me in. He plays a very convincing drug addict in this one... I wonder why?? (Though I've heard he's cleaned himself up and has several movies in the works, and I'm very, truly, proud of him.)Robert Downey Jr, Andrew McCarthy, and Jami Gertz play three people who've been friends since high school. McCarthy's character, Clay, went away to college. Julian (Downey) and Blair (Gertz) stayed in L.A.; Julian becoming a serious junky and Blair becoming a coke-snorting model. When Julian begins to get into serious trouble (he owes the weasely James Spader 50,000 bucks), it's on Clay and Blair's backs to help out their good friend.Their whole world is foreign to me. Lavish parties with every kind of drug available for your smoking or snorting pleasure. The script is good, making this 80s haze very clear to me. Oddly, that's what I really detest about this movie... half of the time the scenes are somewhat hazy looking. I also dislike how several scenes had a funky red tint-- what's supposed to be stylistic is just plain annoying.

It lacks the atmosphere that Bret Easton Ellis had created in his book. Lousy performances are given by everybody save for James Spader, but he wasn't in the same top form like he was in Pretty in Pink. There are a few good scenes, but that is it for me. There isn't any redeeming value about Less Than Zero. Another problem about Less Than Zero is that I couldn't care less about the characters. Who cares if Julian is dead? What's so damned important about him? All in all, it is a good thing that James Spader kept me interested to the end in Less Than Zero.8/12: I've just finished the roman &agrave; clef novella recently and went to the film to see how totally different it was from the book. All that is retained are the title and the name of the characters. Everything else is gone. The performances by everybody are good, but I think James Spader steals the show throughout. In fact, he should have been Clay. I can see Jami Gertz as Blair. I wish that the environment is similar to the book's. Well, it's not interesting to watch a drug addict to be this pathetic and finally dies in the end. Even worse is the constant need to know where Julian is. If the film is going to be like that, what's the point of caring? Just let him to fend for himself. If he dies, oh well...it's nobody's fault but his.

The mansions looked like something straight out of Architectural Digest. Everyone was good looking, had their hair done just right and always wore the latest fashions. They drove expensive cars. They either went to glamorous dinner parties or to clubs that looked like something straight out of an MTV video.

Downey's descent into hell and his attempts to get clean are some of the most harrowing scenes of drug addiction ever committed to screen. Downey is stuck in this troubling predicament, but yet he can't quite manage to escape this fast track LA lifestyle that is making it all the worse.No other film, of its time, has been so self aware of these drug induced, superficial lifestyles of LA's rich and bored and has so vividly captured that on screen.",4,Harrowing portrait of drug addiction,1385164800,"11 23, 2013",2013,1570,"['Make', 'sure', 'check', 'out', 'film', 'review', 'blog', 'criticbrandoncsites.blogspot.comLess', 'Zero', '1987', '***1/2', '4D', 'Marek', 'KanievskaC', 'Andrew', 'McCarthy', 'Jami', 'Gertz', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'James', 'Spader', 'Nicholas', 'Pryor', 'Tony', 'Bill', 'Brad', 'PittP', 'Ivy', 'league', 'college', 'student', 'McCarthy', 'home', 'Christmas', 'only', 'find', 'friends', 'lives', 'have', 'spiraled', 'control', 'are', 'addicted', 'cocaine.Imagine', 'living', 'LA', '80', 'mansions', 'looked', 'something', 'straight', 'Architectural', 'Digest', 'Everyone', 'was', 'good', 'looking', 'had', 'hair', 'done', 'just', 'right', 'always', 'wore', 'latest', 'fashions', 'drove', 'expensive', 'cars', 'went', 'glamorous', 'dinner', 'parties', 'clubs', 'looked', 'something', 'straight', 'MTV', 'video', 'directed', 'Marek', 'Kanievska', 'photographed', 'Ed', 'Lachman', 'fast', 'track', 'LA', 'teenagers', 'lived', 'were', 'completely', 'utterly', 'superficial.In', 'order', 'cover', 'up', 'superficiality', 'lives', 'resorted', 'cocaine', 'use', 'Enter', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'character', 'recent', 'high', 'school', 'grad', 'who', 'manged', 'hit', 'rock', 'bottom', 'less', 'year', 'Downey', 'descent', 'hell', 'attempts', 'get', 'clean', 'are', 'most', 'harrowing', 'scenes', 'drug', 'addiction', 'ever', 'committed', 'screen', 'Downey', 'stuck', 'troubling', 'predicament', 'yet', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'manage', 'escape', 'fast', 'track', 'LA', 'lifestyle', 'making', 'worse.No', 'other', 'film', 'time', 'been', 'so', 'self', 'aware', 'drug', 'induced', 'superficial', 'lifestyles', 'LA', 'rich', 'bored', 'so', 'vividly', 'captured', 'screen']",Less Than Zero VHS

What makes the movie worthwhile are two elements: James Spader and Robert Downey Jr. In my opinion Robert Downey Jr. is the best actor of his generation and the reason I give this film five stars is for, what I believe, is the best work of his career. Gertz and McCarthy are lame but necessary in this formula. That being said, McCarthy's look is perfect for the role.

(The adults in the film are as cipheresque as the kids, so there is no real dramatic interest there -- we have only the kids, and their interactions with drugs, the party scene, and each other.)Seeing it again 25 years later, well ...Downey's performance still holds up, but the rest of the movie is less than zero (sorry).  The director is so absorbed with staging endless party scenes (unintentionally hilarious in their excesses) that he forgets to give the main characters anything interesting to do, and they never develop into anyone we care about.  The final scene, with McCarthy and Gertz sitting forlornly in a cemetery, has no emotional payoff whatever-- McCarthy says come with me to the East Coast, Gertz responds yes, I'll go with you, and the viewer says, ""Thank God, that means the movie's over.""Finally, James Spader doesn't play a real character either, but as other reviewers have noted, he is interestingly slimy as the chief bad guy.

Chow,"[3, 3]","`Less Than Zero' is better know as a Brat Pack classic than as an adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis' best selling novel of the same title.The plot: New Hampshire Ivy League student Clay (Andrew McCarthy) returns home to Beverly Hills for Christmas vacation. Clay was pretty mad about his girlfriend Blair (Jamie Gertz) leaving him for his best friend Julian (Robert Downey Jr.). But upon his return the three are old friends and they drift from nightclub to nightclub partying and doing drugs.Blair ends up returning to Clay as Julian's drug problem is out of control resulting in his poverty and illness. Julian is also in dept to villain Rip (James Spader) whom prostitutes Julian out to other men.Things are pretty clear cut between good and evil as Clay and Blair attempt to save Julian's life.This is a great departure from the book in which Clay is hardly the hero. He is too high on every drug there is to even remember the names of his own siblings, let alone take care of others. The book involves even less plot as Clay and many other friends not in the movie see how much sex, drugs, and rock and roll they can fit into their orgy they call, ""Fxxx Christmas"".I can't imagine a true adaptation of the book would make a very good movie, as every character would be too high to do or say much of anything. The book was mainly popular for Ellis' pulp writing style and social commentary on the opulence of Beverly Hills.So if `Less Than Zero' is a plot lite unfaithful adaptation of an only basely entertaining book why should you see it?Because it embodied everything about the 80s. Truly the production designer should have received top billing. I would put `Less Than Zero' right up there with, ""Earth Girls Are Easy', and `Manhunter' best portraying the colors, styles, and music of the 80s. The Beverly Hills nightclubs and mansions are very richly decorated.The production design itself really is that good as making this movie worth seeing.Robert Downey Jr.'s performance is also noteworthy as I've never seen him play a character so true to himself. He is always sick from drugs, fighting with his friends, a failure at work, and isolated from his family.Bret Easton Ellis also wrote `American Psycho' which is considered an 80s retro classic.

Upon graduation, each has a different plan for his or her life.  Clay heads straight to college, Blair blows off post-secondary education to pursue a modeling career, and Julian attempts to become a nightclub entrepreneur.When Clay comes for the Christmas holidays, his first holiday from college, he finds that the friendship has changed in six months, and not for the better.

Julian's addiction and loan delinquincy drag Clay and Blair with him on a downward spiral as they attempt to get him clean and run interference with Rip.

Don't get me wrong, this is not a terrible movie...I still gave it 3 stars, but if they had called it something else instead of passing it off as an adaptation I would have given it 4 or 5.  The problem is that they don't just take libertys, they change the story completly. Here are a few (just a few) of the reasons I feel the film was destroyed.SPOILER ALERT FOR BOTH THE NOVEL AND THE FILM!!!First off, Clay (McCarthy) does drugs in the novel, and lots of them.  He has no moral code, no ""Let's help Julian""...No, Julian is his dealer and thats all.Second...there was no affair between Julian (Downey Jr.) and Blair (Gertz), and even if there was, Clay wouldn't have cared because he was always strung out on coke and sleeping with somebody else.  They didn't care about boyfriend, girlfriend crap.  Clay would have probably joined in had he found Julian in bed with Blair.Third, the fact that they changed arounf who pimped who in order to spare less extras is fine, but by changing Rips (Spaders) charactor so much they never explore what made him tick as far as the novel is concerned.  One of the most memerable scenes in the novel involves Rip and his friends raping a young girl, and although that may have been to graphic a scene for 80's film it was a defining moment in realizing who Rip was.Fourth, and a BIG fourth...Julian never died in the novel.  There was no tragic ending, no morale issue to contend with.  That scene was added to place a moral code, to place a reason to remember the film.  It was a banner saying ""DON'T DO DRUGS"" but what the producer and director failed to realize is that ""Less than Zero"" is not an anti-drug novel.  It does not have a point, it's just there...and that's what makes it so freaking brilliant.  If they had left it alone, and made the movie that should have been made then they would have had a masterpiece on their hands.Like I said...this is not terrible.  If they had named this film somthing else, anything else...I don't care if it was ""Don't do Drugs"" or hell, even ""Less than Nothing"" just not ""Less than Zero""...It was just a marketing attempt for some guy with a script about the dangers of drug abuse to get his film made, tagging it onto the coat-tails of a popular book at the time.Bad move!",3,"Ok, heres the deal",1140134400,"02 17, 2006",2006,2387,"['am', 'huge', 'Bret', 'Easton', 'Ellis', 'fan', 'so', 'rightfully', 'was', 'appauled', 'way', 'film', 'destroyed', 'novella', 'same', 'name', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'not', 'terrible', 'movie', 'still', 'gave', '3', 'stars', 'had', 'called', 'something', 'else', 'instead', 'passing', 'off', 'adaptation', 'would', 'have', 'given', '4', '5', 'problem', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'take', 'libertys', 'change', 'story', 'completly', 'Here', 'are', 'few', 'just', 'few', 'reasons', 'feel', 'film', 'was', 'destroyed.SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'FOR', 'BOTH', 'THE', 'NOVEL', 'AND', 'THE', 'FILM', 'First', 'off', 'Clay', 'McCarthy', 'drugs', 'novel', 'lots', 'moral', 'code', 'Let', 'help', 'Julian', 'No', 'Julian', 'dealer', 'thats', 'all.Second', 'was', 'affair', 'Julian', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'Blair', 'Gertz', 'even', 'was', 'Clay', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'cared', 'was', 'always', 'strung', 'out', 'coke', 'sleeping', 'somebody', 'else', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'boyfriend', 'girlfriend', 'crap', 'Clay', 'would', 'have', 'probably', 'joined', 'had', 'found', 'Julian', 'bed', 'Blair.Third', 'fact', 'changed', 'arounf', 'who', 'pimped', 'who', 'order', 'spare', 'less', 'extras', 'fine', 'changing', 'Rips', 'Spaders', 'charactor', 'so', 'much', 'never', 'explore', 'what', 'made', 'tick', 'as', 'far', 'novel', 'concerned', 'One', 'most', 'memerable', 'scenes', 'novel', 'involves', 'Rip', 'friends', 'raping', 'young', 'girl', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'graphic', 'scene', '80', 'film', 'was', 'defining', 'moment', 'realizing', 'who', 'Rip', 'was.Fourth', 'BIG', 'fourth', 'Julian', 'never', 'died', 'novel', 'was', 'tragic', 'ending', 'morale', 'issue', 'contend', 'scene', 'was', 'added', 'place', 'moral', 'code', 'place', 'reason', 'remember', 'film', 'was', 'banner', 'saying', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'DO', 'DRUGS', 'what', 'producer', 'director', 'failed', 'realize', 'Less', 'Zero', 'not', 'anti-drug', 'novel', 'not', 'have', 'point', 'just', 'what', 'so', 'freaking', 'brilliant', 'had', 'left', 'alone', 'made', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'then', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'masterpiece', 'hands.Like', 'said', 'not', 'terrible', 'had', 'named', 'film', 'somthing', 'else', 'anything', 'else', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'was', 'Do', ""n't"", 'do', 'Drugs', 'hell', 'even', 'Less', 'Nothing', 'just', 'not', 'Less', 'Zero', 'was', 'just', 'marketing', 'attempt', 'guy', 'script', 'dangers', 'drug', 'abuse', 'get', 'film', 'made', 'tagging', 'coat-tails', 'popular', 'book', 'time.Bad', 'move']",Less Than Zero VHS

But the film itself is a great LA coming of age story.  Andrew Mc Carthy, Jamie Gertz, and Robert Downey Jr. give some really great performances as friends whose lives take unexpected turns after college.  A bulk of the film focuses on Julians drug problem and the failed relationship between Jamie Gertz's character Blair and Andrew Mc Carthy's character Clay.  She was supposed to go away with him to college but stayed behind and sorta got involved with their mutal buddy Julian. I really enjoyed this film.

If not for Robert Downey Jr. and James Spaders' performances, however, the other actors could not have carried the message with such brutal force.  Julian is a wreck of an addict, distraught over family issues, wild eyed with crazy drug induced moods, not really making it in school, and his circle of friends, male and female, are his only salvation.  At the same time, they are his downfall, for Julian slides effortlessly into the glamorous world of sex, clubs and drugs with his friends right by his side.  This picture came out in the eighties, when JUST SAY NO was on everyone's lips, and the dangers of ""recreational"" drug use were not exposed as vividly.  Watching Julian's descent into hell feels like a punch in your chest, and the ending, though some may have seen it coming, shook me up considerably, having known a person with a similar fate back in my '80's high school days.  Of course this film is not classic filmmaking or even original storytelling, but I think showing it to impressionable teens at an early age might not be a bad idea.  And how accurately did art mirror life when, in the 1990's, Downey Jr. nearly killed himself getting high on everything under the sun.

Hollywood was eager to buy the rights to this best-selling novel, but Hollywood was also too chicken to actually film it... so they ran the novel through a wringer, and what came out on the other side is a formula story of two friends (Andrew McCarthy and Jami Gertz) who try to stop a third friend (Robert Downey Jr.) from taking a drug-fueled elevator straight to [the bottom]. And director Marek Kanievska even manages to foul that up, too.The really frustrating thing about this film is how good the cast is--or rather, how could it COULD have been if absolutely anything about this sorry waste of time and money had been worth a damn. This is a really, truly shabby bit of hyped-up commercialism without any substance to it at all, badly written, directed, and filmed, and the only other title to which I can compare it is the abominable Didi Conn film YOU LIGHT UP MY LIFE.

Sure, it did fair box office, because it had some of the ""hip"" actors of the day appearing in it AND because it was based on THE hip book (I was right there living it too!).The unfortunate aspect of the film is that neither the script, the actors, nor the directer ever really provide us with a ""baseline"" from which we can launch any sympathy for Julian (Downey Jr.). We see he, Clay (McCarthy) and Blair (Gertz) all graduate high school, but we don't know what they were like IN high school. Therefore, as we are thrust into Julian's ever downward spiraling drug habit, we don't know if this is normal or not.Clay and Blair dated through high school. Julian was their best friend. All three come from obscenely wealthy and priviledged West coast families with little in the way of family values to show them their way in life. Everything has been handed to them and that was it - no real parenting apparently ever took place.After Clay leaves LA to go East to an ivy league school, Julian and Blair start bedding each other. Even though Blair is contemptible for her actions, it appears that she and Clay are the only two in this film who have any real sense of responsibility and Blair realizes hers late in the film.Julian's daddy gave him tons of money to start a business and Julian lost it all on drugs and partying. He's been ""homeless"" ever since, sleeping in parks and at friends houses when he can. In the process, his drug habit has gone from coke to crack and possibly a little heroin along the way. Where does he get it all? Why their high school friend, Rip (Spader) of course. He's not only a major drug dealer, but apparently does some pimping of women and men on the side. Julian is in for $50K to Rip and the only way he can work it off is to turn tricks with guys....Aint this all uplifting and exciting? Well, it has its exciting moments. And when you consider all the action in this film takes place over Clay's college Christmas break, it's all the more distressing.The film effectively captures the ambiance of privileged college kids gone wild in the 80's. The clothing and the excess is all very very real. It's a shame that the film just never lets us feel too sorry for Julian. I wanted to shake him or kick his rear end. What a tool! And Clay and Blair...? If I'd been them, I'd have kicked ol' Julian to the curb long before - what a bore taking care of a drug addict (forgive me my seeming lack of concern, but I have ACTUALLY taken care of a drug addicted friend - it gets old really quickly...the lies, etc.).Anyway, if you allow the script's lack of a true emotional center, then I have to complain about one further thing: Andrew McCarthy. I have never understood why he was a working actor of such popularity. Downey Jr. (amazing in this film, because it was at one of his greatest times of drug abuse - which makes it a true case of art imitating life and vice versa) and Gertz are fine in the film. But McCarthy...I've never thought him capable of acting his way out of a wet paper sack. There's nothing going on there. No emotion. No sense of urgency other than when he moves quickly. His face is blank, completely vacuous...Anyway, buy this for its value as a real time capsule into some of the excesses of the 80's but don't get it because it's a great film or for any DVD extras, because what's there is slim to none - mostly various versions of the film's trailer.",2,"Great 80's time capsule, but a fairly lousy movie",1145577600,"04 21, 2006",2006,3507,"['Less', 'Than', 'Zero', 'was', 'hailed', 'place', 'when', 'was', 'released', '.hailed', 'critics', 'Sure', 'did', 'fair', 'box', 'office', 'had', 'hip', 'actors', 'day', 'appearing', 'AND', 'was', 'based', 'THE', 'hip', 'book', 'was', 'right', 'there', 'living', 'too', '.The', 'unfortunate', 'aspect', 'film', 'script', 'actors', 'directer', 'ever', 'really', 'provide', 'baseline', 'can', 'launch', 'sympathy', 'Julian', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'see', 'Clay', 'McCarthy', 'Blair', 'Gertz', 'graduate', 'high', 'school', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'were', 'IN', 'high', 'school', 'Therefore', 'are', 'thrust', 'Julian', 'ever', 'downward', 'spiraling', 'drug', 'habit', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'normal', 'not.Clay', 'Blair', 'dated', 'high', 'school', 'Julian', 'was', 'best', 'friend', 'three', 'come', 'obscenely', 'wealthy', 'priviledged', 'West', 'coast', 'families', 'little', 'way', 'family', 'values', 'show', 'way', 'life', 'Everything', 'been', 'handed', 'was', 'real', 'parenting', 'apparently', 'ever', 'took', 'place.After', 'Clay', 'LA', 'go', 'East', 'ivy', 'league', 'school', 'Julian', 'Blair', 'start', 'bedding', 'other', 'Even', 'Blair', 'contemptible', 'actions', 'Clay', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'film', 'who', 'have', 'real', 'sense', 'responsibility', 'Blair', 'hers', 'late', 'film.Julian', 'daddy', 'gave', 'tons', 'money', 'start', 'business', 'Julian', 'lost', 'drugs', 'partying', 'been', 'homeless', 'ever', 'sleeping', 'parks', 'friends', 'houses', 'when', 'can', 'process', 'drug', 'habit', 'gone', 'coke', 'crack', 'possibly', 'little', 'heroin', 'way', 'Where', 'get', 'Why', 'high', 'school', 'friend', 'Rip', 'Spader', 'course', 'not', 'only', 'major', 'drug', 'dealer', 'apparently', 'pimping', 'women', 'men', 'side', 'Julian', '50K', 'Rip', 'only', 'way', 'can', 'work', 'off', 'turn', 'tricks', 'guys', '.Aint', 'uplifting', 'exciting', 'Well', 'exciting', 'moments', 'when', 'consider', 'action', 'film', 'place', 'Clay', 'college', 'Christmas', 'break', 'more', 'distressing.The', 'film', 'effectively', 'ambiance', 'privileged', 'college', 'kids', 'gone', 'wild', '80', 'clothing', 'excess', 'very', 'very', 'real', 'shame', 'film', 'just', 'never', 'feel', 'too', 'sorry', 'Julian', 'wanted', 'shake', 'kick', 'rear', 'end', 'What', 'tool', 'Clay', 'Blair', ""'d"", 'been', ""'d"", 'have', 'kicked', 'ol', 'Julian', 'curb', 'long', 'before', 'what', 'bore', 'taking', 'care', 'drug', 'addict', 'forgive', 'seeming', 'lack', 'concern', 'have', 'ACTUALLY', 'taken', 'care', 'drug', 'addicted', 'friend', 'old', 'really', 'quickly', 'lies', 'etc', '.Anyway', 'allow', 'script', 'lack', 'true', 'emotional', 'center', 'then', 'have', 'complain', 'one', 'further', 'thing', 'Andrew', 'McCarthy', 'have', 'never', 'understood', 'why', 'was', 'working', 'actor', 'such', 'popularity', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'amazing', 'film', 'was', 'one', 'greatest', 'times', 'drug', 'abuse', 'true', 'case', 'art', 'imitating', 'life', 'vice', 'versa', 'Gertz', 'are', 'fine', 'film', 'McCarthy', ""'ve"", 'never', 'thought', 'capable', 'acting', 'way', 'wet', 'paper', 'sack', 'nothing', 'going', 'emotion', 'sense', 'urgency', 'other', 'when', 'quickly', 'face', 'blank', 'completely', 'vacuous', 'Anyway', 'buy', 'value', 'real', 'time', 'capsule', 'excesses', '80', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'great', 'film', 'DVD', 'extras', 'what', 'slim', 'none', 'mostly', 'various', 'versions', 'film', 'trailer']",Less Than Zero VHS

There are also two fine performances from two great actors.Robert Downey Jr. gives a highly realistic performance as Julian, a hopeless junkie spiraling rapidly into oblivion before the eyes of his best friend Clay, played by Andrew McCarthy, and his on again, off again borderline coke-head gal-pal model, Blair(Jami Gertz). After Clay returns home from school, he's found that Julian has bedded his girl, and that being away has changed where he fits into this new drug addled scene. Despite this glaring breach of friendships, Clay plays the good egg who tries to keep both parties from self destruction.The perpetually bug-eyed McCarthy seems strangely detached and unemotional in his role, while Jami Gertz, whom I usually find interesting, seems one dimensional and stiff.  The award here goes to the talented Robert Downey Jr. as Julian.  In this film he puts out a sincerely gut-wrenching performance. I once read that he said he WASN't acting, and that WAS how he is in real life.  Is the fact or the fiction stranger?  You must watch this and find out.My favorite actor in general, as well as in this movie, is the great James Spader. I've seen just about everything he's ever been in, and he is no disappointment here. He turns in a fabulous performance as Trent, a ruthless drug dealer who has Julian under his thumb. When Julian gets in over his head and can't pay for his increasing habit, Trent is appropriately loathesome and cruel as he pimps Julian to earn his keep. The degradation he is put through escalates as Blair and Clay try to save him. James Spader and Robert Downey Jr. also worked beautifully together in the wonderful teen love story ""Tuff Turf"" in 1985. (See my review for more).The other important reason to view this film, is that it's truly beautiful in the visual aspect. We see California wealth illustrated in moving pictures of bright technicolor.  Vividly  sparkling blue swimming pools,  elegant mansions with colorful manicured gardens and sprawling lawns too. Everyone looks like a fashion model who just stepped out of a glossy magazine. The parties are replete with debauched debutantes in crystal mirrored bathrooms holding their coke-bloody noses.  Watching this film is a guilty pleasure we must all experience vicariously.Although it can be somewhat depressing at times, especially toward the end, I STILL enjoy it. The film also features a killer soundtrack that captures the era perfectly. These elements serve to elevate a minimally flawed script, and make this a visually arresting piece of gorgeous celluloid eye candy that needs to seen and sampled, even if you don't always like the taste of the rest.",5,A Visually Compelling Tale Of Self Destruction.,1013990400,"02 18, 2002",2002,2839,"['most', 'striking', 'element', 'will', 'hook', 'watching', 'Bret', 'Easton', 'Ellis', 'novel', 'adaption', 'same', 'name', 'captivating', 'visual', 'beauty', 'sets', 'cinematography', 'are', 'also', 'two', 'fine', 'performances', 'two', 'great', 'actors.Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'highly', 'realistic', 'performance', 'Julian', 'hopeless', 'junkie', 'spiraling', 'rapidly', 'oblivion', 'eyes', 'best', 'friend', 'Clay', 'played', 'Andrew', 'McCarthy', 'again', 'off', 'again', 'borderline', 'coke-head', 'gal-pal', 'model', 'Blair', 'Jami', 'Gertz', 'Clay', 'home', 'school', 'found', 'Julian', 'bedded', 'girl', 'being', 'away', 'changed', 'where', 'new', 'drug', 'addled', 'scene', 'glaring', 'breach', 'friendships', 'Clay', 'good', 'egg', 'who', 'keep', 'parties', 'self', 'destruction.The', 'perpetually', 'bug-eyed', 'McCarthy', 'strangely', 'detached', 'unemotional', 'role', 'Jami', 'Gertz', 'whom', 'usually', 'find', 'interesting', 'one', 'dimensional', 'stiff', 'award', 'here', 'talented', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'Julian', 'film', 'out', 'sincerely', 'gut-wrenching', 'performance', 'once', 'read', 'said', ""WASN't"", 'acting', 'WAS', 'how', 'real', 'life', 'fact', 'fiction', 'stranger', 'must', 'watch', 'find', 'out.My', 'favorite', 'actor', 'general', 'as', 'well', 'movie', 'great', 'James', 'Spader', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'just', 'everything', 'ever', 'been', 'disappointment', 'here', 'fabulous', 'performance', 'Trent', 'ruthless', 'drug', 'dealer', 'who', 'Julian', 'thumb', 'When', 'Julian', 'head', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pay', 'increasing', 'habit', 'Trent', 'appropriately', 'loathesome', 'cruel', 'Julian', 'earn', 'keep', 'degradation', 'put', 'through', 'escalates', 'Blair', 'Clay', 'try', 'save', 'James', 'Spader', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'also', 'worked', 'beautifully', 'together', 'wonderful', 'teen', 'love', 'story', 'Tuff', 'Turf', '1985', 'See', 'review', 'more', '.The', 'other', 'important', 'reason', 'view', 'film', 'truly', 'beautiful', 'visual', 'aspect', 'see', 'California', 'wealth', 'illustrated', 'moving', 'pictures', 'bright', 'technicolor', 'Vividly', 'sparkling', 'blue', 'swimming', 'pools', 'elegant', 'mansions', 'colorful', 'manicured', 'gardens', 'sprawling', 'lawns', 'too', 'Everyone', 'fashion', 'model', 'who', 'just', 'stepped', 'glossy', 'magazine', 'parties', 'are', 'replete', 'debauched', 'debutantes', 'crystal', 'mirrored', 'bathrooms', 'holding', 'coke-bloody', 'noses', 'Watching', 'film', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'must', 'experience', 'can', 'be', 'somewhat', 'depressing', 'times', 'especially', 'end', 'STILL', 'enjoy', 'film', 'also', 'killer', 'soundtrack', 'era', 'perfectly', 'elements', 'serve', 'elevate', 'minimally', 'flawed', 'script', 'make', 'visually', 'arresting', 'piece', 'gorgeous', 'celluloid', 'eye', 'candy', 'seen', 'sampled', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'taste', 'rest']",Less Than Zero VHS

Lybarger,"[0, 0]","Let's get one thing out in the open right off the bat: A good majority of people put this film down and contribute it to a typical &#34;1980's film.&#34; To me, that's just total nonsense! This film, with stunning performances by Robert Downey, Jr., Jami Gertz, Andrew McCarthy and James Spader make this an absolute classic! Whilst the three main characters (Julian, Blair and Clay) may be &#34;spoiled rich kids&#34;) their lives are anything but perfect. Watch as Blair wishes her father a Merry Christmas through a closed bedroom door - while he's banging his latest girl - or as Julian's father threatens to call the cops on him for entering his own home.Some might say that this film wasn't a stretch for Downey, Jr., because he was a severe drug addict at the time, but his performance in this film is startling! It is realistic and very depressing! This is not a &#34;happy&#34; movie; it is quite the opposite and not easy to watch. But if you can get past the dour nature of the subject matter, this is a must see film!Not only is the film great, but you also get some great music, namely, Jimi Hendrix, David Lee Roth and The Doors. Plus, The Bangles turn in a great rendition of &#34;A Hazy Shade Of Winter&#34; and... you get the late, great Roy Orbison with his incredible version of &#34;Life Fades Away&#34; at the end of the movie. As far as music in a film, I don't believe that anyone could ask for anything more!This movie is a dire look into the world of drugs and the price that one pays when entering that world. It is sad, depressing and quite sobering. But... it is also a GREAT film! I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a great movie with great music and a story that has something very tangible to tell.Less Than Zero is a classic movie... with great performances by the four main characters (as mentioned above). If you're in doubt as to whether or not you should purchase this, my suggestion is to get it!

Those young people, and their parents as well, didn't seem to care about anything but their next party or their next affair.  But the film adaptation goes overboard in the opposite direction, trying to make Clay and his sometime girlfriend, Blair, look like paragons of caring in a non-caring world.  As if the film directors realized that Clay in the book was too empty a personality to hold a movie together, they switched the focus to Julian, a peripheral player in the book; we're supposed to feel angst at watching him self-destruct through his addiction to drugs.  Clay and Blair come across as even less interesting in the movie than they do in the book.  Except for two excellent performances by Robert Downey as Julian and James Spader as a drug dealer who keeps Julian hooked, the actors are uninspired and the film script can only be described as banal.

Blair (main vice: cocaine), Julian (crack), and Clay (college) are over-privileged children of divorce in 1980s L.A., a generation that supposedly was forced to mature too fast, its innocence lost very early. But the film never makes the audience feel a damn thing for them, because the script never allows them to articulate anything.

As a Beverly Hills kid at the time, I felt it had none of the satirical bite of Ellis's book, and turned Beverly Hills into a Vogue-magazine version of the city.

I'm surprised I didn't start laughing out loud, a la ""MST3K"", such lame protagonism. It's like, ""Okay, but you and what army? I've got your buddy and your erstwhile girlfriend in my pocket, and you're just Ivy League Ken! Ha! Ha!"".

I do feel badly seeing Julian go down the slipperly slope of addiction, and rather than want to smack some sense into him, I'd would much rather save that for his a**hole dad. What idiot in his right mind gives his kid that much money to start a recording studio straight out of high school if the kid has no music business experience to begin with? I'm thinking if you have the frogskins to p*ss away on this venture, you have enough money to give your kid the highest quality drug rehab there is to offer. My parents would have done this for me. No, just tough-love ""daddy's little family disgrace"" to the point where he is sleeping on park benches in expensive clothing and selling himself through a ruthless ex-high school classmate to pay off his 50,000K coke debt.

The  book does have a plot, and is more focused on the character of Clay than  that of Julian.  If anything, Julian is a sideshow in the book, yet he is  in nearly every scene of the movie.  The friendship between Blair, Clay,  and Julian is highly embellished in this movie, wasn't such a focal point  in the book.

Things go from bad to schmaltzy as the characters engage in cryptic conversations. Their dialogue shows them to be cool and they are always impeccably dressed, but apparently engaging in actual dialogue would be uncool, so mostly they engage in faux-witty banter.We don't quite understand what is at the core of the angst Gertz and McCarthy evidence. Maybe they felt it was the thing to do, but it makes for boring filmmaking.Downey turns in a much better performance, although many unanswered questions remain about his character as well. Was part of his seduction with Gertz really a thwarted wish to have a sexual relationship with McCarthy? Or to get even with him somehow for moving ahead with his life and leaving the two of them behind?Whatever the reason, his guilt and pain send him on a cocaine binge that has Downey exiled by his family and agreeing to prostitute himself for cocaine. Here, James Spader turns in a chilling small turn as the dealer who seems to enjoy witnessing Downey's degradation.While we can sympathize with Downey - particularly in light of the sad true-live addiction that has stunted his career and repeatedly put him in trouble with the law - sympathy is not to be had forGertz or McCarthy.They come across soley as cold, self-centered and the sort of kids you basically just wanted bad things to happen to.For instance, during one scene, when a girl's nose starts bleeding because her habitually cocaine habit has actually eroded the carilage in her nose, she only giggles and says ""rusty pipes"" as she dabs at the blood. Gertz just looke on, saying nothing.It's no surprise to the audience that there is no happy ending here. At the end, we are left to hope that the startling finality of death, witnessed close up, will lead some of the characters to a new start.That, in any case, rang sadly true.Lady Fushia",2,Couldn't care less,1015804800,"03 11, 2002",2002,3000,"['idea', 'entertainment', 'see', 'how', 'rich', 'young', 'beautiful', 'can', 'be', 'brought', 'low', 'then', 'movie', 'Beautiful', 'then-dewey', 'Jami', 'Gertz', 'Andrew', 'McCarthy', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'portray', '18-year-olds', 'ties', 'society', 'other', 'own', 'futures', 'are', 'compromised', 'one', 'way', 'heavy', 'drug', 'use', 'two', 'them.Thus', 'are', 'witness', 'betrayal', 'degradation', 'despair', 'longing', 'ultimately', 'tragedy', 'three', 'attempt', 'come', 'terms', 'neglect', 'carelessness', 'brought', 'friendships', 'lives', 'brink.It', 'may', 'be', 'hard', 'however', 'mainstream', 'audience', 'members', 'feel', 'much', 'pity', 'three', 'spoiled-rotten', 'rich', 'kids', 'so', 'much', 'what', 'wrong', 'lives', 'own', 'fault.True', 'parents', 'are', 'not', 'perfect', 'few', 'are.The', 'three', 'close', 'friends', 'apparently', 'spent', 'youths', 'united', 'cruel', 'torments', 'rich', 'indifferent', 'parents.Gertz', 'McCarthey', 'characters', 'are', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'love', 'college', 'out', 'only', 'oh', 'weeks', 'before', 'bedded', 'buddy', 'Downey.We', 'see', 'guilt', 'betrayal', 'thwarted', 'love', 'Things', 'go', 'bad', 'schmaltzy', 'characters', 'engage', 'cryptic', 'conversations', 'dialogue', 'be', 'cool', 'are', 'always', 'impeccably', 'dressed', 'apparently', 'engaging', 'actual', 'dialogue', 'would', 'be', 'uncool', 'so', 'mostly', 'engage', 'faux-witty', 'banter.We', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'understand', 'what', 'core', 'angst', 'Gertz', 'McCarthy', 'evidence', 'Maybe', 'felt', 'was', 'thing', 'do', 'boring', 'filmmaking.Downey', 'turns', 'much', 'better', 'performance', 'many', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'remain', 'character', 'as', 'well', 'Was', 'part', 'seduction', 'Gertz', 'really', 'thwarted', 'wish', 'have', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'McCarthy', 'get', 'even', 'somehow', 'moving', 'ahead', 'life', 'leaving', 'two', 'reason', 'guilt', 'pain', 'send', 'cocaine', 'binge', 'Downey', 'exiled', 'family', 'agreeing', 'prostitute', 'cocaine', 'Here', 'James', 'Spader', 'chilling', 'small', 'turn', 'dealer', 'who', 'enjoy', 'witnessing', 'Downey', 'degradation.While', 'can', 'sympathize', 'Downey', 'particularly', 'light', 'sad', 'true-live', 'addiction', 'stunted', 'career', 'repeatedly', 'put', 'trouble', 'law', 'sympathy', 'not', 'be', 'had', 'forGertz', 'McCarthy.They', 'come', 'across', 'soley', 'cold', 'self-centered', 'sort', 'kids', 'basically', 'just', 'wanted', 'bad', 'things', 'happen', 'to.For', 'instance', 'one', 'scene', 'when', 'girl', 'nose', 'starts', 'bleeding', 'habitually', 'cocaine', 'habit', 'actually', 'eroded', 'carilage', 'nose', 'only', 'giggles', 'rusty', 'pipes', 'blood', 'Gertz', 'just', 'looke', 'saying', 'nothing.It', 'surprise', 'audience', 'happy', 'ending', 'here', 'end', 'are', 'left', 'hope', 'startling', 'finality', 'death', 'witnessed', 'close', 'up', 'will', 'lead', 'characters', 'new', 'start.That', 'case', 'rang', 'sadly', 'true.Lady', 'Fushia']",Less Than Zero VHS

With that being said, I think they also wanted to somewhat bring some resolution to the movie that wasn't in the book. I guess I'm torn in this review for the simple fact that even though I know this movie is not like the book, I still didn't altogether hate it (I didn't love it either). Don't get me wrong, they seriously twisted the details as far as the way the book actually goes, but in the book nothing is solved. The same way you start at page 1 is the same way you'll end up at page 200. This movie is sad and depressing, and that's exactly what the book is, but the movie would've been better if they wouldn't have deliberately changed so much. In the book, Clay wasn't the hero, he was an addict too. Secondly, this movie focuses only on Julien's addiction, but Julien isn't even in the book until the end. Thirdly, the real slap in the face to the fans is that Julien..DOESN'T DIE! Don't get me wrong, I guess with the movie they wanted to bring forth a resolution while emphasizing not to do drugs because this is ultimately what your life could be. It just didn't manage to impress any fans of the novel though. I must admit the one good thing this movie did have going for it was James Spader. James Spader was definitely in his comfort zone though seeing as how he played the bully/bad guy in all of the movies he did in the 80's. It doesn't matter he still rocked it though. Ultimately, I see the statement they were making with the movie, but I guess I could've appreciated it more if they stuck to the story. I guess the best advice I can give is to judge this movie on it's own terms. If you avoid the book you'll like the movie. If you've already read the book, then you should avoid the movie because it will only make you angry.",3,O.K!,1176336000,"04 12, 2007",2007,1882,"['think', 'what', 'mostly', 'lot', 'people', 'frustrated', 'movie', 'included', 'exactly', 'opposite', 'book', 'being', 'said', 'think', 'also', 'wanted', 'somewhat', 'bring', 'resolution', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'book', 'guess', ""'m"", 'torn', 'review', 'simple', 'fact', 'even', 'know', 'movie', 'not', 'book', 'still', 'did', ""n't"", 'altogether', 'hate', 'did', ""n't"", 'love', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'seriously', 'twisted', 'details', 'as', 'far', 'way', 'book', 'actually', 'book', 'nothing', 'solved', 'same', 'way', 'start', 'page', '1', 'same', 'way', ""'ll"", 'end', 'up', 'page', '200', 'movie', 'sad', 'depressing', 'exactly', 'what', 'book', 'movie', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'deliberately', 'changed', 'so', 'much', 'book', 'Clay', 'was', ""n't"", 'hero', 'was', 'addict', 'too', 'Secondly', 'movie', 'only', 'Julien', 'addiction', 'Julien', ""n't"", 'even', 'book', 'end', 'Thirdly', 'real', 'slap', 'face', 'fans', 'Julien..DOES', ""N'T"", 'DIE', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'guess', 'movie', 'wanted', 'bring', 'forth', 'resolution', 'emphasizing', 'not', 'do', 'drugs', 'ultimately', 'what', 'life', 'could', 'be', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'manage', 'impress', 'fans', 'novel', 'must', 'admit', 'one', 'good', 'thing', 'movie', 'did', 'have', 'going', 'was', 'James', 'Spader', 'James', 'Spader', 'was', 'definitely', 'comfort', 'zone', 'though', 'seeing', 'how', 'played', 'bully/bad', 'guy', 'movies', 'did', '80', ""n't"", 'matter', 'still', 'rocked', 'Ultimately', 'see', 'statement', 'were', 'making', 'movie', 'guess', 'could', ""'ve"", 'appreciated', 'more', 'stuck', 'story', 'guess', 'best', 'advice', 'can', 'give', 'judge', 'movie', 'own', 'terms', 'avoid', 'book', ""'ll"", 'like', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'already', 'read', 'book', 'then', 'should', 'avoid', 'movie', 'will', 'only', 'make', 'angry']",Less Than Zero VHS

Clay (Andrew McCarthy) returns home for Christmas to see his friends Blair and Julian (Jami Gertz &amp; Downey, Jr.) and finds them immersed in the ruins of drugged-out living.  The movie is basically his attempts to tag after and save Julian from himself before he--duh--gets in too deep.The recent troubles in Robert Downey Jr.'s personal life make his portrayal of the drugged-out Julian all the more resonant and convincing.  &quot;Less Than Zero&quot; is really his movie, and he shines in spite of the grunge his character is pulled through.  Andrew McCarthy is well-cast as the heroic, boyishly handsome Clay.  Jami Gertz does well, but her appeal as a sex symbol must have lived and died in the 1980s: she shows capable acting ability, but it's hard to watch her monstrous facial expressions.  In a supporting role, James Spader is typically excellent as a sleazy drug dealer.Some have said the film is hollow and lacks the spirit of Ellis' novel, but I'm not in a position to say.  Judging &quot;Less Than Zero&quot; only by the movie alone, I would have to reply with nothing but enthusiasm.  It's a drama that doesn't manipulatively pull at the viewer's heartstrings with cliche, but instead is honest about its subject and as a result, more genuine.",4,a great showcase for Robert Downey Jr.'s talents,972864000,"10 30, 2000",2000,1890,"['have', ""n't"", 'yet', 'read', 'novel', 'have', 'heard', 'lashings', 'critics', 'Bret', 'Easton', 'Ellis', 'alike', 'have', 'thrown', 'film', 'version', 'quot', 'Less', 'Than', 'Zero.', 'quot', 'nothing', 'new', 'when', 'Hollywood', 'liberties', 'good', 'book', 'Kubrick', 'hack-job', 'quot', 'Shining', 'quot', 'ideal', 'example', 'very', 'rarely', 'do', 'adaptations', 'hit', 'screen', 'flawlessly.Well', 'being', 'said', 'must', 'say', 'quot', 'Less', 'Than', 'Zero', 'quot', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'moment', 'not', 'commitment', 'source', 'material', 'affecting', 'tale', 'addiction', 'jaded', 'ruined', 'L.A.', 'club', 'scene', 'circa', '1987', 'Clay', 'Andrew', 'McCarthy', 'home', 'Christmas', 'see', 'friends', 'Blair', 'Julian', 'Jami', 'Gertz', 'amp', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'immersed', 'ruins', 'drugged-out', 'living', 'movie', 'basically', 'attempts', 'tag', 'save', 'Julian', 'duh', 'too', 'deep.The', 'recent', 'troubles', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'personal', 'life', 'make', 'portrayal', 'drugged-out', 'Julian', 'more', 'resonant', 'convincing', 'quot', 'Less', 'Than', 'Zero', 'quot', 'really', 'movie', 'spite', 'grunge', 'character', 'pulled', 'Andrew', 'McCarthy', 'well-cast', 'heroic', 'boyishly', 'handsome', 'Clay', 'Jami', 'Gertz', 'well', 'appeal', 'sex', 'symbol', 'must', 'have', 'lived', 'died', '1980s', 'capable', 'acting', 'ability', 'hard', 'watch', 'monstrous', 'facial', 'expressions', 'supporting', 'role', 'James', 'Spader', 'typically', 'excellent', 'sleazy', 'drug', 'dealer.Some', 'have', 'said', 'film', 'hollow', 'spirit', 'Ellis', 'novel', ""'m"", 'not', 'position', 'say', 'Judging', 'quot', 'Less', 'Than', 'Zero', 'quot', 'only', 'movie', 'alone', 'would', 'have', 'reply', 'nothing', 'enthusiasm', 'drama', ""n't"", 'manipulatively', 'pull', 'viewer', 'heartstrings', 'cliche', 'instead', 'honest', 'subject', 'result', 'more', 'genuine']",Less Than Zero VHS

In this 1987 film, Clay (Andrew McCarthy) returns to his native Los Angeles for Christmas break his freshman year of college. He hopes to rekindle his relationship with girlfriend Blaire (Jami Gertz), who had taken up with his best friend Julian (Robert Downey, Jr.) in Clay's absence. He's disappointed to find Blaire strung out on cocaine and annoyed by her insistence that Julian is in some kind of trouble and needs his help. Julian's business failures have left him deep in debt to a drug dealer (James Spader) and wasted all the time.There probably isn't much point in comparing ""Less Than Zero"", the movie, with the book. They have little more than the characters' names in common, but Ellis' novel does strike me as a strange source for an anti-drug movie. The tone of the movie is wired for the MTV generation, in contrast to the book's droning, indifferent narration and aimless characters. Nosebleed Clay has been replaced with a goody-two-shoes, in love with Blaire, concerned about doing the right thing, who won't touch cocaine! This is a conventional drama about friends trying to save one another from the abyss of drug dependency and its concomitant evils. The film is a humorless converse of the book in most respects.Judging the movie on its own merits, I like the cast, although Andrew McCarthy is conspicuously too old to play 18. I also like the theme song, The Bangles' remake of Simon & Garfunkel's ""Hazy Shade of Winter"", which plays in its entirety over the sequence of Clay's return to L.A. That song captures the 1980s better than the rest of the movie. The trouble is that this film is a very straightforward, one-note, anti-drug message, and that's all it is. Drugs will ruin your relationships, plunge you into the depths of despair, and probably kill you. It's surprisingly talky, and the dialogue clanks. Clay tries to save a couple of friends from their vices between semesters. Not horrible, but not noteworthy either.The DVD (20th Century Fox 2001): There are 3 theatrical trailers, an English trailer (1min 30 sec), a Spanish version of the same trailer, and a ""Hard Version"" trailer in English (2 min).

A movie like this captures so much as a period in history as it does an attitude and a message.  Here we see an insipid cast of 80s trust fund babies in southern California wasting their lives keeping a nose the the mirror while their parents in their tennis whites are either too busy, too frivolous, or too unattentive to care.  Most of their sober moments are spent in paranoia and vomiting while they flounder from one place or party to another.What's the point, some of you are asking?  Well the underline point is ""Just Say No"", of course.  But the minor points, as I would learn, lead down just such a destructive path.  Robert Downey Jr. and the others who are all screwed up on drugs choose this for themselves.  They are given every opportunity, every challenge, and ever material thing only to throw it away.  I was just a kid when I saw this movie and didn't understand anything about it, except that they were people with problems.  As an adult I would meet people who might not have been the wealthiest or most privilaged, but they were just as self centered and unwilling to do anything but drugs.  They always claimed poverty, but always had enough money to buy drugs or take trips to places.  They wanted freedom and indepence from their parents or other ""establishment"" things, but didn't do anything about it but more drugs.

However I'd be lying to say it was anything like the book. For instance in the book Clay is an emotionless empty void who more than occasionally takes drugs and never really finds fulfillment or contentness  by the end one can't really feel sympathy for him in the novel. The film gave him more of a soul with some direction in life which one can sympathize with. The book has more characters that weave in and out of the story. The movie seemed to focus more on Julian (Downey Jr) & his decent into addiction.  I'm one of those people who actually liked the movie a little more than the novel. What I liked about this film for one the cinematography was outstanding really went with the mood of the film. It made you want to see what the scene was like in LA in the 80's besides the drugs there was a lot of energy. Overall I thought the acting was good. James Spader's portrayal of money hungry drug dealer Rip was flawless. Downey Jr really caught the essence of a drug addict I thought.In short synopsis Clay (Andrew McCarthy) comes back to Hollywood -LA after attending school back east in New England College. He comes back to his coke addicted girlfriend Blair ( Gertz) & messed up best friend Julian (R Downey Jr) who has a drug addiction the size of Utah after his dreams of owning a record label collapse. Clay notices nothing has really changed around here but Julian is going down the tubes faster everyday. He owes the local drug dealer Rip major amount of money. Clay tries desperately to help them out and bring them back to school with him. One of best films in 80's cinema. A lot of people bagged on this film because they say it didn't accurately represent the book. I think it wasn't meant to be just like the book. But it's one of those movies that brings you right there as if your living it for the hour & a half that your watching it good dark drama film.

242312,A363QRXP83K8ZE,6301006798,"N. P. Stathoulopoulos ""nick9155""","[0, 0]","Less Than Zero still looks like the MTV School of Movies product it was back in 1987 when that channel beat everyone over the head with the Bengals' remake of Hazy Shade of Winter.  Matter of fact, that song plays almost in its entirety over the opening credits for no other reason than, well, marketing a soundtrack.I'm kind of split over this film.  It has little to do with the actual plot of Bret Easton Ellis' source novel, but then again, given that Ellis is rarely concerned with ""plot"" that doesn't seem to matter much.  I don't think there's a single scene in this film that is taken from the book, and to some degree, the film downplays some of the seedier elements of the source material.  In the end, it's a somewhat depressing film about addiction and what happens when you lose all control.Clay (Andrew McCarthy) returns to LA for Christmas, having just finished his first semester at a New England college.  Of course, in true Hollywood style, these people do not look like teenagers, nor do they act like most teenagers.  A few months translates to massive, earth-shattering events in their lives.  You know, the kinds of events that only happen to the stupidly rich and decadent on TV and in movies.  (You may start wondering why your life was never this explosive at 18).  Clay's childhood buddy Julian (Robert Downey, Jr.), an underachieving rich kid with a wild side, is in some kind of trouble.  The spaced out Blair (Jamie Gertz), begs Clay to talk to him.  But Clay would rather get back together with Blair even though he found her in bed with Julian during Thanksgiving break.Long story short, Julian is broke, the record label his father set him up in after high school went pear shaped, his drug problem is out of control, and his father wants nothing to do with him.  Julian has taken about six months from graduation to spiral downward into debt, free base, booze, and general LA-malaise.  Clay seems like the only hope, even if he's pretty much a space cadet himself.The film meanders; its only real dedication is in playing song after song in true music video style in an attempt at telling a story.  Wasn't Ellis condemning this type of world in the novel?  I guess the movie is more concerned with good business than condemnation.I'm torn between thinking the performances by the two main leads are awful and thinking that they are actually perfect for the film.  Ellis' characters in the book were not deep.  They were a bunch of severely disaffected youth with too much time, money,and freedom on their hands and absolutely nothing to show for it but a bloody nose from bad coke.  It was close to impossible to feel anything for any of them, and that comes across clearly in the film.  The film is not coherent enough to be doing any real moralizing.  The characters seem to have grown up too fast and are, frankly, losers.However, this is really Robert Downey, Jr.'s life story: a guy who just can't stop, who keeps falling off the wagon, gets back on, promises to clean up, and then screws up again.  He is an excellent actor with more talent than the rest of the cast combined.  You're convinced he's not acting half the time.  His only rival for performance is the tremendous James Spader as a somewhat sympathetic drug dealer, the type of sleazy guy who seems to grow on trees in Beverly Hills.  He stalks the hot clubs of LA like a shark, looking menacing in the music video light as he hunts down the ever-sinking Julian.While Julian was a minor character in the book, the absolute lack of depth in both leads makes the decision to tell Julian's story a wise one, even if it is numbing.  It's doubtful that anyone watching Less Than Zero will feel an iota of sympathy, but Downey Jr. works hard (or does he?) to play someone so completely out of control.  He is the main draw here, providing a spectacle for the morbidly curious.  Less Than Zero is a good title since it describes how much value you can attach to anyone here.Oddly enough, the ending also foreshadows that later Andrew McCarthy classic, Weekend at Bernie's.The DVD looks pretty good.  The film is heavy on style, and the lighting in some shots is expressive and makes for nice eye candy.  I liked the scene of the motorcycle gang roaring by the stopped Corvette.Tidbit: One of the trailers features some of Giorgio Moroder's music from Cat People.

Although this movie isnt the best adaption from Bret Easton Ellis' smash novel, it still hits at home hard.I read the back of the DVD before buying it, and said to my friend that I had a feeling i was going to be disappointed (because it just read like it was a crappy adaption) but i couldnt have been more wrong.I can't express myself more when I say that humans versus drugs is a losing battle for us.  And this movie backs me up greatly.Just by watching Julian (Downey Jr.) slowly fall into one of his binges is enough to make tears come to your eyes.  To watch his friends try and help, and to see they are in a lost cause hurts just as much.The acting in this movie is awesome.  The cast is some of the best teen actors from the middle 80's, and the director hit his mark perfectly.  I would think that Ellis' (Less than Zero author) is very proud.Rather than focusing in on the worthless lives of the young and rich in L.A.  as Ellis did in the novel, this flick really just pics three characters from the book and focuses more into their lives over Christmas vacation and what they are doing to themselves.This movie is incredible.

242316,A1GN8UJIZLCA59,6301006798,P Magnum,"[6, 7]","Less Than Zero is an adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis' postmodern classic.  While the film does dilute some the book's stronger  elements, it does make one huge and superb change, elevating Julian from a minor character in the book into the centerpiece of the film.  Robert Downey, Jr. is mesmerizing as Julian in what would become his break out role.  The movie revolves around three rich kids from L.A. during Christmas break after their high school graduation.  Clay (Andrew McCarthy) has gone east to college while his girlfriend Blair (Jamie Gertz) and Julian stay home.  Right before leaving Clay discovers Julian and Blair in bed together.  Although their is some tension, the trio remain friends.  The problems come from Julian's hardcore drug habit.  It has resulted in him being banished from his house and being heavily indebted to his drug dealer Rip (James Spader).  Rip pimps Julian out as a homosexual prostitute and Julian cannot do anything about it.  Clay and Blair try their best to help their friend, but Blair herself has a small cocaine problem.  The film has some strong performances in addition to Mr. Downey's, especially by Mr. Spade, who is effectively icy as Rip.  The film is shot in a music video style with a stellar soundtrack that includes Public Enemy, The Bangles, Aerosmith and the legendary Roy Orbison.  The most intriguing aspect of the film is how it mirrors the real life of Mr. Downey.  It is down right eerie on how closely his own bouts of drug addiction and several attempts at redemption mirror his character Julian.",4,More Or Less,1017014400,"03 25, 2002",2002,1561,"['Less', 'Than', 'Zero', 'adaptation', 'Bret', 'Easton', 'Ellis', 'postmodern', 'classic', 'film', 'dilute', 'book', 'stronger', 'elements', 'make', 'one', 'huge', 'superb', 'change', 'elevating', 'Julian', 'minor', 'character', 'book', 'centerpiece', 'film', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'mesmerizing', 'Julian', 'what', 'would', 'become', 'break', 'out', 'role', 'movie', 'three', 'rich', 'kids', 'L.A.', 'Christmas', 'break', 'high', 'school', 'graduation', 'Clay', 'Andrew', 'McCarthy', 'gone', 'east', 'college', 'girlfriend', 'Blair', 'Jamie', 'Gertz', 'Julian', 'stay', 'home', 'Right', 'leaving', 'Clay', 'discovers', 'Julian', 'Blair', 'bed', 'together', 'tension', 'trio', 'remain', 'friends', 'problems', 'come', 'Julian', 'hardcore', 'drug', 'habit', 'resulted', 'being', 'banished', 'house', 'being', 'heavily', 'indebted', 'drug', 'dealer', 'Rip', 'James', 'Spader', 'Rip', 'pimps', 'Julian', 'out', 'homosexual', 'prostitute', 'Julian', 'can', 'not', 'do', 'anything', 'Clay', 'Blair', 'try', 'best', 'help', 'friend', 'Blair', 'small', 'cocaine', 'problem', 'film', 'strong', 'performances', 'addition', 'Mr.', 'Downey', 'especially', 'Mr.', 'Spade', 'who', 'effectively', 'icy', 'Rip', 'film', 'shot', 'music', 'video', 'style', 'stellar', 'soundtrack', 'Public', 'Enemy', 'Bangles', 'Aerosmith', 'legendary', 'Roy', 'Orbison', 'most', 'intriguing', 'aspect', 'film', 'how', 'real', 'life', 'Mr.', 'Downey', 'down', 'right', 'eerie', 'how', 'closely', 'own', 'bouts', 'drug', 'addiction', 'several', 'attempts', 'redemption', 'mirror', 'character', 'Julian']",Less Than Zero VHS

They went to school together, grew up together and remained attached to each other during those years.  Regardless of the fact that they all have rich parents and live in posh California homes; all three of them are lonely, unhappy and emotionally damaged in some way.  Their mutual love for each other seems to heal some of those emotional wounds.I do not want to retell the plot of the film, but it is wonderful and touching.  It is a story of the ethernal and true freindship that are so rare they happen only once in a lifetime.

To see these star's early work was the most redeeming factor, then look at where they all are now.  The tragic story of drugs ruining lives, friendships, families, perhaps was a newer concept back then?  Having lived in the 80's (or lived through) one could possibly relate to the moral of the story that drugs bring bad fashion to the level of beyond Popular & less of a statement of expression. The life of the lead Robert Downey Jr. in the film became real.  ""Art immitating life & Life becoming less than artful."" A foreshadowing of his future sans film.  Although I happen to think Downey can truly act on some level worth watching. James Spader was his typical self (see Boston Public this season).  Still Standing (CBS) was a winner tho with showing that mother's younger days of bad hair & Coke. All in all it was a romp through the blast from the past era.  The best part is when Downey barfs after Supposedly being FORCED to give oral sex to other men to pay off his debt.  Can we say TYPE CASTING?  Altho, I do believe he's never been forced to give oral sex to any man rather eagerly engages in it til he gets it right. The soundtrack was however memorable & for these things is worth keeping in one's collection, if nothing more than to remind us of Hollywoods use of POOR RICH KIDS GONE WRONG.

Let's get the rubbish out of the way.  The plot is twiddled with until it barely resembles the book.  A lot of Ellis' humour gets lost in translation.  Blair is a brunette unlike her published blonde doppelganger. Hmmm.That said, Less Than Zero is probably the one film that epitomises the 80s like no other for me.  The opening shots, with the Bangles brilliant cover of 'Hazy Shade...' clanging in the background, still invites chills.Others have written the plot succintly, so I will say that if you want a cold, clinical, no exit look at being a rich, bored teen in LA, search no further.  Blair (Jamie Gertz)is deliciously confused, drugged and flakey, and Clay, the solid rock in the middle of his friends' breakdowns is perfectly cast in a youthful Andrew McCarthy.  Top honours go to Robert Downey Jnr, spookily playing out his own future as the drug addled Julian with frenetic highs and lows, insincere to himself and broken to his mates, and  James Spader as the vile pimp and dealer Rip.Wonderfully photographed by Edward Lachman, it's simultaneously lush and sparse.  If the end scenes don't get you sobbing into a pillow, then take that stone out of your chest and get a heart.  Less Than Zero has been unfairly mauled by many, but it stands up today as a film with much more going for it than you may think.  For starters, it may be one of the only teen flicks that doesn't make you howl/cringe because of ropey dialogue and cheeseball disco moments.  Its 'drugs message' is played out minus politics and simply invites you take a journey with the characters. Death, it seems to say, is inevitable for everyone, some just go a little faster.Less Than Zero is sexy, frank and troubled.  There could not have been a better antithesis to the whizz bang makeover! of other 80s teen films (John Hughes take note!).

242329,A3IP0R4JOD4R5G,6301006798,the masked reviewer,"[6, 7]","It is not quite the compliment it may sound to say that Robert Downey Jr. steals every scene in LESS THAN ZERO (even the ones he's not in). His co-stars in this botched film version of the infamous Bret Easton Ellis novel are Andrew McCarthy and Jami Gertz, both of whom so completely embody their characters' blankness that they leave two voids at the center of the story. Downey could mistakenly be judged to have walked off with the acting honors by default, the easiest victory since Theresa Russell (in a very similar role) wrested THE RAZOR'S EDGE away from Bill Murray and Catherine Hicks. This, however, would be to severely underrate Downey's careful recreation of a life out of control. An accident waiting to happen, Downey's Julian roars with the painful last gasp of a party boy for whom time is running out. Lying upside down in McCarthy's red convertible, singing screwed-up Christmas carols as they cruise L.A. after dark, Downey portrays the side of drug use that the ""Just Say No"" folks most dread: It's fun to be high (that is, until it's not). Despite the screenplay's watered-down insistence that Downey and McCarthy are competing for the favors of Gertz's character, Downey instead slyly plays his part like it's torn from the scorched pages of the novel, where the two boys are lovers, not just friends. It's a bold choice that brings his character to vivid life: In addition to all the other emotional ravages he evokes, he shows us with his panicky, sad eyes that he knows he's losing McCarthy to Gertz. Not that all of this aspect of his character is in the subtext; to pay his debts off to his dealer Rip (James Spader), Julian acts as a prostitute for Rip's other male clients.In his absurdly cheerful holiday shirt, the incorrigible Julian offers us the flip side of those too-neat TV movie plots about parents practicing ""tough love"" on their addict children; seen here from the helplessly self-destructive kid's point of view, the familiar tale is unbearably painful to watch. But Downey's energetic charisma keeps us from looking away, even when he takes us into the horror show of what it looks like when Julian overdoses. Downey makes us care how Julian, cut off by his family and hunted by his creditors, lives before he dies.In the film's most resonant image, the sweating, shell-shocked Julian is feeling so like a cornered animal that even the reflections off a swimming pool take on the appearance of bars that entrap him. He won't, can't, go inside to a Christmas party: ""I feel like Tiny f---in' Tim,"" he says, so despondent that it's clear he knows no help will come, although he never stops lying outwardly. ""It's not going to happen again, this; it's over,"" he'll tell anyone who'll listen, and Downey gives just the right hollow cadence to this automatic lie that fools no one. ""I'm gonna probably go back into rehab."" Downey conveys the physical hysteria of the hopeless addict with equal finesse. Long after the movie is over, one is haunted by the scene of Downey alone (his pals are doing Christmas dinner with their dysfunctional families), doing a lonely little soft-shoe routine. Simple, understated, unforgettable. It is a sublime moment.It has been said that Downey's take on Julian was probably a case of life imitaing art. Perhaps. . . But that only makes the performance much more astonishing. Plenty of Hollywood's elite have tried their hands at the same type of role and come up wanting, even though they too were ""living the role in real life.""

242334,A1DVIXEVBAH2XS,6301006798,"Utah Jack Squint ""utah_jack_squint""","[1, 9]","I happened to catch *Less Than Zero,* a film based on Bret Easton Ellis's novella of the same name, on Bravo one afternoon. It wasn't the first time I'd seen it, but I hadn't seen it in so long that it was as if I was watching it for the first time.I recall that the film--featuring such eighties bratpackers as the eternally pubescent Andrew McCarthy, a particularly unctious and reptilian James Spader, and, in an eerily prescient casting choice, the soon-to-be recidivist substance abuser Robert Downey, Jr. as the troubled, substance abusing Julian--struck me at the time of its release as being an important, unblinking exploration of the plight of the spectacularly wealthy, whose main problem seems to be their spectacular wealth. Watching it now, in 2004, I cannot help but think that the film's singular attraction rests in a certain lurid relish in seeing the beautiful folk of Beverly Hills plummet from high atop the ramparts of the house that Reaganomics built, and endure a series of picturesque humilations as they descend. In other words, we seek in the film the frisson of fabulous devastation.Which brings me to my point: as cinematic tragedy, *Less Than Zero* fails utterly, because it constucts a world in which morality is almost entirely absent. The film eschews this ponderous convention altogether and opts instead for the pseudo-effects of spectacle. This choice on the filmaker's part, however, becomes deleterious to the film, reducing it to a series of gestures, poses, and set pieces of such calculated slickness that the net effect upon the viewer is one of estrangement. She sees constructed before her a demimonde of such moral vacuity as to be nearly unrecognizable. Ignoring for a moment the film's commercial enticements--the now laughably garish late-eighties couture and the various other items of conspicuous consumption--one is left with an intensely derivative film full of clich&eacute; dialogue, stock poor-little-rich-girl-and-guy types, and contrived situations. Thus, instead of eliciting our sympathy, Julian's fall from his plush aerie high above L.A. to the decidedly unglamorous back rooms in which he fellates strangers takes on all the dumb inevitability of a hurricane. We feel as if we are watching something monstruous and misbegotten that must surely collapse and suffocate on its own bulk--which, if we are totally honest with ourselves, is often our attitude when witnessing the extravagances of the filthy rich.Hence the strategem of *Less Than Zero*: it begs the audience to supply it with the moral context it cannot itself provide. To borrow the language of of neo-Aristotelian literary critic Wayne Booth, *Less Than Zero* constructs an ideal viewer who is such a well-conditioned creature of popular culture that she will reflexively endow the film with the gravitas it itself foresakes in its pursuit of spectacle. All she must do is respond to cues: a suggestive glance, insouciant mugging, the figure of a dishevelled Julian pensively smoking on the beach. However, should this ideal viewer never materialize, or, if present, prove refractory, then the film falls on the sword of its own irrelevance. *Less Than Zero* value, then, ultimately remains historical. It remains a curious relic of a strange and sinister decade--a decade that managed to be both puritanical and decadent, consisting of strange juxtapositions (The PMRC and DIY video porn, ""Morning in America"" and McMartin Preschool). A decade that, despite its being characterized by gross economic injustice and insane foreign policy (""Mutually Assured Destruction""), has become quite an object of nostalgia for the under-thirty set. It will perhaps be these individuals who restore *Less Than Zero* to its glossily vacuous glory.",1,Would That Amazon Allowed Ratings of Less Than Zero Stars,1136592000,"01 7, 2006",2006,3758,"['happened', 'catch', '*Less', 'Than', 'Zero', 'film', 'based', 'Bret', 'Easton', 'Ellis', 'novella', 'same', 'name', 'Bravo', 'one', 'afternoon', 'was', ""n't"", 'first', 'time', ""'d"", 'seen', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'so', 'long', 'was', 'was', 'watching', 'first', 'time.I', 'recall', 'film', 'featuring', 'such', 'eighties', 'bratpackers', 'eternally', 'pubescent', 'Andrew', 'McCarthy', 'particularly', 'unctious', 'reptilian', 'James', 'Spader', 'eerily', 'prescient', 'casting', 'choice', 'soon-to-be', 'recidivist', 'substance', 'abuser', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'troubled', 'substance', 'abusing', 'Julian', 'struck', 'time', 'release', 'being', 'important', 'unblinking', 'exploration', 'plight', 'spectacularly', 'wealthy', 'main', 'problem', 'be', 'spectacular', 'wealth', 'Watching', 'now', '2004', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'think', 'film', 'singular', 'attraction', 'rests', 'certain', 'lurid', 'relish', 'seeing', 'beautiful', 'folk', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'plummet', 'high', 'ramparts', 'house', 'Reaganomics', 'built', 'endure', 'series', 'picturesque', 'humilations', 'descend', 'other', 'words', 'seek', 'film', 'frisson', 'fabulous', 'devastation.Which', 'point', 'cinematic', 'tragedy', '*Less', 'Than', 'Zero*', 'utterly', 'world', 'morality', 'almost', 'entirely', 'absent', 'film', 'ponderous', 'convention', 'altogether', 'opts', 'instead', 'pseudo-effects', 'spectacle', 'choice', 'filmaker', 'part', 'however', 'deleterious', 'film', 'reducing', 'series', 'gestures', 'poses', 'set', 'pieces', 'such', 'calculated', 'slickness', 'net', 'effect', 'viewer', 'one', 'estrangement', 'constructed', 'demimonde', 'such', 'moral', 'vacuity', 'be', 'nearly', 'unrecognizable', 'Ignoring', 'moment', 'film', 'commercial', 'enticements', 'now', 'laughably', 'garish', 'late-eighties', 'couture', 'various', 'other', 'items', 'conspicuous', 'consumption', 'one', 'left', 'intensely', 'derivative', 'film', 'full', 'clich', 'eacute', 'dialogue', 'stock', 'poor-little-rich-girl-and-guy', 'types', 'contrived', 'situations', 'Thus', 'instead', 'eliciting', 'sympathy', 'Julian', 'fall', 'plush', 'aerie', 'high', 'L.A.', 'decidedly', 'unglamorous', 'back', 'rooms', 'strangers', 'dumb', 'inevitability', 'hurricane', 'feel', 'are', 'watching', 'something', 'monstruous', 'misbegotten', 'must', 'surely', 'collapse', 'suffocate', 'own', 'bulk', 'are', 'totally', 'honest', 'ourselves', 'often', 'attitude', 'when', 'witnessing', 'extravagances', 'filthy', 'rich.Hence', 'strategem', '*Less', 'Than', 'audience', 'supply', 'moral', 'context', 'can', 'not', 'provide', 'borrow', 'language', 'neo-Aristotelian', 'literary', 'critic', 'Wayne', 'Booth', '*Less', 'Than', 'Zero*', 'ideal', 'viewer', 'who', 'such', 'well-conditioned', 'creature', 'popular', 'culture', 'will', 'reflexively', 'endow', 'film', 'gravitas', 'pursuit', 'spectacle', 'must', 'do', 'respond', 'cues', 'suggestive', 'glance', 'insouciant', 'mugging', 'figure', 'dishevelled', 'Julian', 'pensively', 'smoking', 'beach', 'However', 'should', 'ideal', 'viewer', 'never', 'materialize', 'present', 'prove', 'refractory', 'then', 'film', 'sword', 'own', 'irrelevance', '*Less', 'Than', 'Zero*', 'value', 'then', 'ultimately', 'historical', 'curious', 'relic', 'strange', 'sinister', 'decade', 'decade', 'managed', 'be', 'puritanical', 'decadent', 'consisting', 'strange', 'juxtapositions', 'PMRC', 'DIY', 'video', 'porn', 'Morning', 'America', 'McMartin', 'Preschool', 'decade', 'being', 'characterized', 'gross', 'economic', 'injustice', 'insane', 'foreign', 'policy', 'Mutually', 'Assured', 'Destruction', 'become', 'quite', 'object', 'nostalgia', 'under-thirty', 'set', 'will', 'perhaps', 'be', 'individuals', 'who', 'restore', '*Less', 'Than', 'Zero*', 'glossily', 'vacuous', 'glory']",Less Than Zero VHS
