801071,A1K8UEUPSP7L33,B0001DHSKG,Beginner pretzel,"[5, 5]","If you are just getting started with yoga, or are interested in getting started with yoga, then START HERE!!!  This is the absolute best dvd to introduce yourself to yoga.  Unlike just about every other instructor on a yoga dvd Ms. Corn does her instruction just a little bit different.  Instead of just doing the routine and then narrating, Ms. Corn is actually talking you through the whole thing while she does it.  This is especially good because she strongly emphasizes proper alignment whether it is the placement and angle of the feet or how your body is supposed to feel or how it is supposed to be turned while doing an asana (pose).  Although I have since passed this dvd on to my father I still like to use the second dvd in the series every now and then to remind myself of how I am supposed to be aligned when doing certain poses.  Also, instead of going for a lot of fluff with the background Ms. Corn takes a minimalist approach to her dvds.  There is no expensive set in the background, just Ms. Corn in a black outfit and a black background.  Her dvds are wonderfully instructional and I can't wait for her to come out with the next dvd in this series.  Hopefully she will stick with the same style of doing things in the next dvd.  On a different note, if you are starting yoga, and you do find this dvd to be too difficult for you to do, then I would suggest the ""Yoga for Dummies"" dvds.  These dvds would be a good predecessor to this one only if you need it.",5,A great place to start,1148083200,"05 20, 2006",2006,1479,"['are', 'just', 'getting', 'started', 'yoga', 'are', 'interested', 'getting', 'started', 'yoga', 'then', 'START', 'HERE', 'absolute', 'best', 'dvd', 'introduce', 'yoga', 'Unlike', 'just', 'about', 'other', 'instructor', 'yoga', 'dvd', 'Ms.', 'Corn', 'instruction', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'different', 'Instead', 'just', 'doing', 'routine', 'then', 'narrating', 'Ms.', 'Corn', 'actually', 'talking', 'whole', 'thing', 'especially', 'good', 'strongly', 'proper', 'alignment', 'placement', 'angle', 'feet', 'how', 'body', 'supposed', 'feel', 'how', 'supposed', 'be', 'turned', 'doing', 'asana', 'pose', 'have', 'passed', 'dvd', 'father', 'still', 'use', 'second', 'dvd', 'series', 'now', 'then', 'remind', 'how', 'am', 'supposed', 'be', 'aligned', 'when', 'doing', 'certain', 'poses', 'Also', 'instead', 'going', 'lot', 'fluff', 'background', 'Ms.', 'Corn', 'minimalist', 'approach', 'dvds', 'expensive', 'set', 'background', 'just', 'Ms.', 'Corn', 'black', 'outfit', 'black', 'background', 'dvds', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'instructional', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'come', 'out', 'next', 'dvd', 'series', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'stick', 'same', 'style', 'doing', 'things', 'next', 'dvd', 'different', 'note', 'are', 'starting', 'yoga', 'do', 'find', 'dvd', 'be', 'too', 'difficult', 'do', 'then', 'would', 'suggest', 'Yoga', 'Dummies', 'dvds', 'dvds', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'predecessor', 'one', 'only', 'need']",N/A

The speed of her delivery relates more to enthusiasm than to any urgency.Vinyasa Yoga is an ideal form of Yoga for those who are most interested in muscular flexibility, refinement of breathing, and inner peace.  For those with knee problems (and provided they advantag take of towels, pads and other knee-protective tools) Vinyasa Yoga is easier on the joints than most, strengthening the lower back, quadruceps, back muscles and spirit all at once.While Ms. Corn is clearly beautiful, her beauty is valuable only to the extent that it commands more precise attention, and especially from male viewers. Her words are far more magnetic, and her teaching skills are extraordinary.For me, this first lesson could occupy a year. Ms. Corn, emphasizes the importance of learning in stride and committing the positions to memory along the way, The regimen she provides, however, makes this fairly easy.It matters not whether you believe in a particular god or form of religion. Ms. Corn's approach is to honor life with exercise and breath and to extend our gratitude for health to our fellows. That is more than acceptable.Gaiam's production is uncommonly good, and postures are all captured beautifully in backlit profile. The musical acompaniment is logical and congenial.Best of all, the package comntains two discs, one for instruction and training and the second for untutored practice.This is a wonderful way to initiate people of al ages to Yoga without peril, however some users should consult a physician with any doubts or concerns befofe proceeding with this training.A lovely, healing and high-value DVD taught by an instructor who cares.",5,Superb Lesson from a Master at a Bargain Price,1157155200,"09 2, 2006",2006,1775,"['Seane', 'Corn', 'simply', 'not', 'typical', 'Yofga', 'teacher', 'very', 'very', 'quickly', 'somehow', 'mesage', 'precisely', 'speed', 'delivery', 'more', 'enthusiasm', 'urgency.Vinyasa', 'Yoga', 'ideal', 'form', 'Yoga', 'who', 'are', 'most', 'interested', 'muscular', 'flexibility', 'refinement', 'breathing', 'inner', 'peace', 'knee', 'problems', 'provided', 'advantag', 'take', 'towels', 'pads', 'other', 'knee-protective', 'tools', 'Vinyasa', 'Yoga', 'easier', 'joints', 'most', 'strengthening', 'lower', 'back', 'quadruceps', 'back', 'muscles', 'spirit', 'once.While', 'Ms.', 'Corn', 'clearly', 'beautiful', 'beauty', 'valuable', 'only', 'extent', 'more', 'precise', 'attention', 'especially', 'male', 'viewers', 'words', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'magnetic', 'teaching', 'skills', 'are', 'extraordinary.For', 'first', 'lesson', 'could', 'occupy', 'year', 'Ms.', 'Corn', 'importance', 'learning', 'stride', 'committing', 'positions', 'memory', 'way', 'regimen', 'however', 'fairly', 'easy.It', 'matters', 'not', 'believe', 'particular', 'god', 'form', 'religion', 'Ms.', 'Corn', 'approach', 'honor', 'life', 'exercise', 'breath', 'extend', 'gratitude', 'health', 'fellows', 'more', 'acceptable.Gaiam', 'production', 'uncommonly', 'good', 'postures', 'are', 'captured', 'beautifully', 'backlit', 'profile', 'musical', 'acompaniment', 'logical', 'congenial.Best', 'package', 'two', 'discs', 'one', 'instruction', 'training', 'second', 'untutored', 'practice.This', 'wonderful', 'way', 'initiate', 'people', 'al', 'ages', 'Yoga', 'peril', 'however', 'users', 'should', 'consult', 'physician', 'doubts', 'concerns', 'proceeding', 'training.A', 'lovely', 'healing', 'high-value', 'DVD', 'taught', 'instructor', 'who']",N/A

The first DVD goes into great detail about the form of  Seane Corn's routine. It was boring to me since I'm not a beginner, but might be useful to someone just starting out.The second DVD is Seane performing her routine to music. There's no speaking, so if you want to follow along you have to constantly look up at the screen. There are no queues when she changes poses, not even an option in the DVD menus to turn on queues.Unless you want to just sit and watch Seane's performance it doesn't lend it's self to following along. I like yoga practices that help you through the practice and focus on looking within. The person who made the comment about going to the gym is missing the boat. I am not looking for a sweat and burn yoga workout, I would just hope there would be some kind of queueing.I would recommend Yoga for Urban Living as the best yoga DVD for your money.

It's not practical to keep your eyes on the screen while doing poses, it almost seems anti-yoga. Why would anyone do this?

801082,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B0001DHSKG,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[127, 136]","If you are serious about Yoga, a Seane Corn workout will probably find you. They do say that when you are ready to learn, a teacher will appear. Seane Corn takes Yoga to a deeper level as she focuses more deeply on the entire yoga experience. She emphasizes the link between the breath and body. In the past few months, I've been finding that breathing is essential for deeper stretching.Seane Corn is one of the most sought after yoga instructors. If you are interested in a one-on-one lesson, Vinyasa Flow Yoga is a highly-guided workout with calming music. Seane's instruction style is slightly more intense and much more serious than I am used to, but by the end of the DVD I felt amazingly calm, stronger and at peace.Seane Corn's seriousness may come from her view that yoga is a divine ritual. You can really create a little heaven on earth through breath and movement. She takes yoga to a deeper level through integrating the breath with movement. The posesare not complicated and I recognized most of the classicroutines:Sun SalutationsStanding PosesTwistsMeditationRelaxationVinyasa Breathing techniquesThis Deluxe DVD Edition also has an interview with Seane.After doing this workout I could not decide if this was for beginners, intermediate or advanced. In fact, it might just be for all three. While beginners are just learning the poses, Seane moves slowly enough to allow for this aspect. Intermediate yogis will enjoy the relaxing pace and detailed instruction. Anyone who is at the advanced level will more than likely enjoy the additional spiritual aspects (brief prayer and affirmations) and length (72 minutes) of the practice. The unscripted format is also quite refreshing. You feel like you are in a yoga class.If you enjoy an ancient, flowing style of yoga, this might be for you. While this starts off fairly slowly, the continued practice and movements from the floor to standing will give you a spiritually healing experience. You will feel increased blood flow and as you work with your breath, your entire body will thank you for the experience.I could also see Seane Corn making a breathtakingly beautiful outdoor DVD. I hope she will move into the light (outdoors) because this DVD can at times be a bit shadowy in places.

Some have complained she talks too much, but it's all about the pose, getting in/out, what to watch out for, how to place all body parts (I learned new info even after 4 years & 30 yoga dvds.) Her speaking wasn't hurried or stressed in my opinion at all. She just sounds earnest in wanting to help others do it correctly to avoid injury & also so they don't give up due to not understanding. I think with all her info it helped me to be more present & not let my mind wander to daily worries becasue I breathed the most deep I'd ever done during a yoga workout & even the most deep even when I am trying to breathe deeply. I do like when the yoga teacher speaks since it reminds me to be aware of where my body is & what I am doing.I just wished there was more then just teaching sun salutations of plank, lunges, upward dog, cobra, downward dog; triangle, side angle, warrior 1 & 2, child's pose, twisted triangle, butterfly, bridge, seated leg stretching, etc.Disk 2 has her doing a routine w/the poses you learned, but you can only hear her breath. It's great for keeping rhythm, but it's hard w/o a good voice-over of her telling you what pose to do & maybe quick telling you when to get in/out of it.You can see a preview at gaiam comYoutube under ""Vinyasa Flow Yoga DVD Preview with Seane Corne""",4,Great detailed instruction that answers almost all questions,1154476800,"08 2, 2006",2006,1385,"['disk', 'one', 'Seane', 'Corn', 'teaches', 'simple', 'stage', 'alone', 'beautiful', 'muted', 'music', 'have', 'complained', 'too', 'much', 'pose', 'getting', 'in/out', 'what', 'watch', 'out', 'how', 'place', 'body', 'parts', 'learned', 'new', 'info', 'even', '4', 'years', '30', 'yoga', 'dvds', 'speaking', 'was', ""n't"", 'hurried', 'stressed', 'opinion', 'just', 'earnest', 'wanting', 'help', 'others', 'do', 'correctly', 'avoid', 'injury', 'also', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'due', 'not', 'understanding', 'think', 'info', 'helped', 'be', 'more', 'present', 'not', 'let', 'mind', 'wander', 'daily', 'worries', 'becasue', 'breathed', 'most', 'deep', ""'d"", 'ever', 'done', 'yoga', 'workout', 'even', 'most', 'deep', 'even', 'when', 'am', 'trying', 'breathe', 'deeply', 'do', 'when', 'yoga', 'teacher', 'be', 'aware', 'where', 'body', 'what', 'am', 'doing.I', 'just', 'wished', 'was', 'more', 'then', 'just', 'teaching', 'sun', 'salutations', 'plank', 'lunges', 'upward', 'dog', 'cobra', 'downward', 'dog', 'triangle', 'side', 'angle', 'warrior', '1', '2', 'child', 'pose', 'twisted', 'triangle', 'butterfly', 'bridge', 'seated', 'leg', 'stretching', 'etc.Disk', '2', 'doing', 'routine', 'w/the', 'poses', 'learned', 'can', 'only', 'hear', 'breath', 'great', 'keeping', 'rhythm', 'hard', 'good', 'voice-over', 'telling', 'what', 'pose', 'do', 'maybe', 'quick', 'telling', 'when', 'get', 'in/out', 'it.You', 'can', 'see', 'preview', 'gaiam', 'comYoutube', 'Vinyasa', 'Flow', 'Yoga', 'DVD', 'Preview', 'Seane', 'Corne']",N/A

(This is a 2 DVD set)  I think it's a fantastic place for beginners to start.  Seane Corn gives you plenty of time to learn and feel the pose and lots of verbal cues .  Some people don't, but I also appreciate the spiritual side which is left out in many DVD's focusing only on the ""excerise"" side of Yoga...Okay for the 2nd Vinyasa flow DVD...only 1 star. With absolutely no verbal cueing, those of us who have a TV above 12"" on the ground must constantly look up to see what the instructor is doing.  (Ironically, the very first pose is done with your eye's closed)I bought this DVD because I have number of instructional DVD's and wanted a pure flow DVD to follow....this one isn't it.
