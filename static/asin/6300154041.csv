That's saying something, as I have seen tons of his cartoons in my short 20 year life-span ranging from the Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Movie to his awesome animated version of The Phantom Tollbooth. All of his cartoons are highly recommended, blending excellent storytelling, sweet background animation, hilarious humor, and the overall greatness with makes him a legend among cartoon makers. But this cartoon is my favorite work of his. I first saw it as a young child and it has improved with age. The voices are perfect, the pacing is perfect, the music is great, the animation is Chuck Jones' best. But what makes this movie for me is the way a house in India is made into an entire world for the hero of the story, a brave Mongoose called Rikki-Tikki-Tavi. He a cute furry creature, yet by fighting snakes who would harm his human masters he is (to me at least) like a knight protecting his kingdom from monsters. Everything in the movie is seen from his eyes, and he possesses an extreme sense of loyalty which makes him a very admirable character.

Rikki is an adroable character (Who is a mongoose, for that reviewer who didn't know), who is full of charm, but at the same time doesn't overdo the cute thing one bit, and show's off a darker, more vicious side when defending his new found family. Although I'm by no means, a supporter of sheltering children at all, I must say that the few scene's where Rikki gets deperate to save his master, the young boy, as well as the Snake's vicious ways may really scare some children.  I'm not saying to keep it away, as it never scared me, and being realistic, probably won't scare children out of their wits at all as Rikki whops butt pretty much.  But all the same, keep in mind this movie has its darker moments.  But in short, its a simple plot, and a rather coy charm with a simple objective, and it gets the job done great.
