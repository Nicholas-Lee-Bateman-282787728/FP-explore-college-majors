It is interesting, at least for me, to compare the different good versions.The singing an acting of this cast was outstanding. Rosina played by Kathleen Battle was fanny and convincing in her role .she is a very good coloratura singer which this character requires and her acting was very charming. The amusing roles of Figaro and Bartolo were very well done, her singing and acting brought out the comical aspects of the opera. The conde character was also good.Scenery and costumes were excellent, the different scenes as well as the lights were very effective.The orquestra, since the opening of the opera ,the overture, was outstanding",5,A very charming performance.,1362268800,"03 3, 2013",2013,738,"['decided', 'buy', 'DVD', 'reviewers', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'even', 'had', 'version', 'interesting', 'least', 'compare', 'different', 'good', 'versions.The', 'singing', 'acting', 'cast', 'was', 'outstanding', 'Rosina', 'played', 'Kathleen', 'Battle', 'was', 'fanny', 'convincing', 'role', '.she', 'very', 'good', 'coloratura', 'singer', 'character', 'acting', 'was', 'very', 'charming', 'amusing', 'roles', 'Figaro', 'Bartolo', 'were', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'singing', 'acting', 'brought', 'out', 'comical', 'aspects', 'opera', 'conde', 'character', 'was', 'also', 'good.Scenery', 'costumes', 'were', 'excellent', 'different', 'scenes', 'as', 'well', 'lights', 'were', 'very', 'effective.The', 'orquestra', 'opening', 'opera', 'overture', 'was', 'outstanding']",N/A

Held,"[2, 2]","I ordered this, delighted to finally find this particular production on DVD...because it features the incomparable Kathleen Battle before she was fired from the Met for being a too-demanding diva.  Battle has one of the most appealing and gorgeous soprano voices I have ever heard.  I have all of her albums.  She is simply charming in this production, and the production itself is terrific.  I especially like the revolving set design (as a retired scenic designer myself), and how it is used to neat effect as the actors move with the set to change locales.

His singing and performance in this opera is better than in his other performances, really perfect and beautiful and made the whole opera so enjoyable. Kathleen Battle, sung so brilliantly in her clear coloratura voice and in appearance quite matched the character of the mischievous young and beautiful Rosina. While Rockwell Blake as the young and romantic Lindoro/Count Almaviva in his appearance quite match the character of the romantic young count who is pursuing Rosina. His singing is not quite mature yet, however match the clear coloratura voice of Kathleen Battle, so that all their duetts sound so beautifully together. We also adore Enzo Dara's performance which represent the real comedy in the foolish old ward of Rosina, who yearned to marry the young and beautiful girl. Last but not the least is Ferruccio Furlanetto's brilliant performance  with his deep Bass baritone voice reflecting the sloppy and sinister music master.The costumes and background set were also as beautiful and prepared with great care which supported the performance itself.In overall, the performance is totally enchanting and marvellous that we will not become tired of playing it over and over again, while relishing to the romantic comedy and beautiful music.",5,Rossini's masterpiece in marvellous performance,1004227200,"10 28, 2001",2001,1657,"['masterpiece', 'Rossini', 'performed', 'so', 'much', 'care', 'excellence', 'enjoyment', 'beginning', 'end.It', 'sung', 'performed', 'so', 'perfectly', 'not', 'so', 'wellknown', 'singers', 'however', 'were', 'successful', 'reflect', 'comedy', 'side', 'opera', 'buffa.Leo', 'Nucci', 'maybe', 'only', 'one', 'already', 'quite', 'known', 'perform', 'so', 'marvellously', 'displaying', 'prankish', 'character', 'barber', 'Figaro', 'singing', 'performance', 'opera', 'better', 'other', 'performances', 'really', 'perfect', 'beautiful', 'made', 'whole', 'opera', 'so', 'enjoyable', 'Kathleen', 'Battle', 'sung', 'so', 'brilliantly', 'clear', 'coloratura', 'voice', 'appearance', 'quite', 'matched', 'character', 'mischievous', 'young', 'beautiful', 'Rosina', 'Rockwell', 'Blake', 'young', 'romantic', 'Lindoro/Count', 'Almaviva', 'appearance', 'quite', 'match', 'character', 'romantic', 'young', 'count', 'who', 'pursuing', 'Rosina', 'singing', 'not', 'quite', 'mature', 'yet', 'however', 'match', 'clear', 'coloratura', 'voice', 'Kathleen', 'Battle', 'duetts', 'sound', 'so', 'beautifully', 'together', 'also', 'adore', 'Enzo', 'Dara', 'performance', 'represent', 'real', 'comedy', 'foolish', 'old', 'ward', 'Rosina', 'who', 'yearned', 'marry', 'young', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'Last', 'not', 'least', 'Ferruccio', 'Furlanetto', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'deep', 'Bass', 'baritone', 'voice', 'reflecting', 'sloppy', 'sinister', 'music', 'master.The', 'costumes', 'background', 'set', 'were', 'also', 'as', 'beautiful', 'prepared', 'great', 'care', 'supported', 'performance', 'itself.In', 'overall', 'performance', 'totally', 'enchanting', 'marvellous', 'will', 'not', 'become', 'tired', 'playing', 'over', 'again', 'relishing', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'beautiful', 'music']",N/A

I don't know what the other reviewers were comparing this to, but based on my viewing experience, this rates near the bottom of the heap.Rockwell Blake as the Conte has a strained, forced voice and acting style which I found totally lacking in charm.  Leo Nucci as Figaro, suffers in close-up, showing his age.  I think if I had been 40 rows back at a live performance I would have enjoyed him more.  But in close-up he does not exhibit the youthful exhuberance I expect from this role. Ferruccio Furlanetto is way too heavy for the comic, lightness and absurdity expected for Basillio, rendering his ""slander"" song too ponderous and dense.On the good side, the stagecraft is complex and sumptuous in the best tradition of a Met production.  Kathleen Battle has a lightness and spontanaity that I found delightful in much contrast to the other principals.

He does his own, tired ""schtick"" which I guess HE feels is funny, but I find unfunny and annoying and draws attention to itself and is not based on the drama or the situation! He can't really sing the role either. He chops up ""A un dottor"" by not singing the sustained notes above the staff. The patter is fast but so what? I have seen him in other Rossini roles and heard him on CD, and I am always left unsatisfied. Thank God the Met gave the latest Barber production to John del Carlo. A buffo who sings with voice and acts withour becoming a characature.Blake sings beautifully with clean coloratura and inexhaustible breath, Nucci is a delight and handles the recit with great understanding, and Battle, before she became so mannered, sings and acts with great charm and security.
