The story is about the head of a center where mentally and emotionally challenged individuals produce and ship products. The focus of the story is on his relationship with one young man (James)who wants others to respect him.The developing relationship challenges both men and brings them to a place of healing and resolution between James and his father and the head of the center and his own estranged son. The acting is riveting and very satisfying. It is not a children's movie, but involves a deep theme about the value of a father, no matter who he is or how much water has gone under the bridge.",5,Powerful,1229904000,"12 22, 2008",2008,652,"['found', 'movie', 'very', 'uplifting', 'inspiring', 'story', 'head', 'center', 'where', 'mentally', 'emotionally', 'challenged', 'individuals', 'produce', 'ship', 'products', 'focus', 'story', 'relationship', 'one', 'young', 'man', 'James', 'who', 'others', 'respect', 'him.The', 'developing', 'relationship', 'men', 'place', 'healing', 'resolution', 'James', 'father', 'head', 'center', 'own', 'estranged', 'son', 'acting', 'riveting', 'very', 'satisfying', 'not', 'children', 'movie', 'deep', 'theme', 'value', 'father', 'matter', 'who', 'how', 'much', 'water', 'gone', 'bridge']",Behind the Mask
1025647,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B000JBWWSI,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[1, 1]","Dr. Robert Shushan (Donald Sutherland) is a workaholic leader of a clinic helping and giving useful work to mentally handicapped and developmentally disabled adults. His overwork leads to a heart attack. Shushan's reaction to a heart condition and work is typical--I know--I lived through it myself. Sutherland does a masterful work in displaying the emotion and drive, as well as a new look at life and what is important for a heart attack survivor. He must have had a real heart attack, or he talked to some men that did. Of course he was likely coached by one of the writers, the real Dr. Shushan.His new lease on life awakens him to a need to get closer to his son Brian (Bradley Whitford) who, after years of a civil relationship, questions the need or desire for more of the emotional and loving kinship.Unfortunately, during the heart episode's recovery time, the board of the clinic developed by Dr. Shushan has decided he needs to step down. Shushan takes one desperate stab at making a difference before he must leave. A mentally handicapped client and maintenance worker, James (Matthew Fox) becomes Shushan's focus. James had initially saved Shushan by being at the scene of the heart attack and responding appropriately.  Shushan's enhanced effort to help this young man, lead to an attempt to find his father.  James one great need/wish is to find his father, and that this father be proud of him. What an amazing portral of this young man who begins to see the doctor as his father.Of course, the father is found.  That is no surprise. It really happened. It is the reaction to the situation by all four, 2 sons and 2 fathers, that makes the ending. Powerful drama, and knowing it was real, makes the emotional adventure of this DVD all the better.  Father and son bonds are powerful to watch.Perhaps this is one for all fathers and sons to watch. Perhaps finding more important and realistic goals for life might be approached without the need to have the life-altering heart attack by many viewers.I'm a little slow in coming across this DVD--but so pleased I finally did.It's a love story of sorts, of real men, and real lives, and how men can desire and find a father/son relationship that works.",4,HONEST MALE EMOTIONS--FATHER/SON CONNECTION--POWERFUL ACTING--TRUE LIFE STORY,1250208000,"08 14, 2009",2009,2215,"['Dr.', 'Robert', 'Shushan', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'workaholic', 'leader', 'clinic', 'helping', 'giving', 'useful', 'work', 'mentally', 'handicapped', 'developmentally', 'disabled', 'adults', 'overwork', 'heart', 'attack', 'Shushan', 'reaction', 'heart', 'condition', 'work', 'typical', 'know', 'lived', 'Sutherland', 'masterful', 'work', 'displaying', 'emotion', 'drive', 'as', 'well', 'new', 'look', 'life', 'what', 'important', 'heart', 'attack', 'survivor', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'real', 'heart', 'attack', 'talked', 'men', 'did', 'course', 'was', 'likely', 'coached', 'one', 'writers', 'real', 'Dr.', 'Shushan.His', 'new', 'lease', 'life', 'awakens', 'need', 'get', 'closer', 'son', 'Brian', 'Bradley', 'Whitford', 'who', 'years', 'civil', 'relationship', 'questions', 'need', 'desire', 'more', 'emotional', 'loving', 'kinship.Unfortunately', 'heart', 'episode', 'recovery', 'time', 'board', 'clinic', 'developed', 'Dr.', 'Shushan', 'decided', 'step', 'down', 'Shushan', 'one', 'desperate', 'stab', 'making', 'difference', 'must', 'leave', 'mentally', 'handicapped', 'client', 'maintenance', 'worker', 'James', 'Matthew', 'Fox', 'Shushan', 'focus', 'James', 'had', 'initially', 'saved', 'Shushan', 'being', 'scene', 'heart', 'attack', 'responding', 'appropriately', 'Shushan', 'enhanced', 'effort', 'help', 'young', 'man', 'lead', 'attempt', 'find', 'father', 'James', 'one', 'great', 'need/wish', 'find', 'father', 'father', 'be', 'proud', 'What', 'amazing', 'portral', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'see', 'doctor', 'father.Of', 'course', 'father', 'found', 'surprise', 'really', 'happened', 'reaction', 'situation', 'four', '2', 'sons', '2', 'fathers', 'ending', 'Powerful', 'drama', 'knowing', 'was', 'real', 'emotional', 'adventure', 'DVD', 'better', 'Father', 'son', 'bonds', 'are', 'powerful', 'watch.Perhaps', 'one', 'fathers', 'sons', 'watch', 'Perhaps', 'finding', 'more', 'important', 'realistic', 'goals', 'life', 'might', 'be', 'approached', 'need', 'have', 'life-altering', 'heart', 'attack', 'many', 'viewers.I', ""'m"", 'little', 'slow', 'coming', 'DVD', 'so', 'pleased', 'finally', 'did.It', 'love', 'story', 'sorts', 'real', 'men', 'real', 'lives', 'how', 'men', 'can', 'desire', 'find', 'father/son', 'relationship']",Behind the Mask

I WAS DELIGHTED NOT ONLY THAT THE FILM WAS TRUE, BUT IT DEMONSTRATES GODS WORD IN THAT HE USES THE UNCOMMON THINGS OF THIS WORLD TO CONFOUND THE WISE THINGS. THAT IS PARTICULARLY TRUE IN THIS FILM. YOU CAN SEE THE HAND OF GOD IN THIS FILM AS HE TAKES THIS YOUNG DESPISED AND MISUNDERSTOOD GENTLEMAN FROM WORKING ALONE, TO FINDING HIS FATHER AND LIVING WITH HIM IN SOUTH  CAROLINA. THE ATTITUDE OF THIS YOUNG MAN IS EVIDENTLY REVEALED  IN A PAIN  DIRECTED TOWARD THE WORLD IN AN ATTEMP TO CLEAR SOME INNER FRUSTRATION ABOUT NOT KNOWING HIS DAD. YOU CAN SEE THAT HES NOT JUST A MEAN AND TROUBLED MAN FOR NO REASON, BUT THAT HE WAS JUST HURT AND DIDNT KNOW WHO TO TALK TO OR HOW TO FIX THE PROBLEM. THE CHURCH HE WAS IN LISTENED TO HIM AND FOUND THAT HE WAS LOOKING FOR LOVE. AS HIS BOSS PROMISED TO FIND HIS DAD, THE LESSON OF LOVE WAS EVIDENT IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE BOSS AND HIS OWN SON. THE LOVE THAT THE YOUNG MAN HAD FOR A FATHER HE NEVER MET, ENCOURAGED HIS BOSS TO HAVE A GREATER RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS OWN. FINALLY, THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE YOUNG MAN IN ANTICIPATION FOR HIS FATHER, BROUGHT A BOSS CLOSER TO HIS SON. THE STORY ENDS WITH A BETTER FAMILY STRUCTURE WITH FORGIVENESS IN BOTH HOMES!
