572311,A34WDD1FA7HAVA,B000059H6U,"Amazon Customer ""grrreg""","[20, 22]","A follow-up from BBC's wonderful 'Walking with Dinosaurs' series, this two part video looks at the life of Big Al, a fossil allosaurus from the Jurassic era.  Here in Australia, this was called 'The Ballad of Big Al'.The first episode looks at the life of Big Al over his life of seven years - from birth to death.  Al leads a full life, but it certainly isn't an easy one.  You get to see all aspects of Al's life, both as predator and prey, eating, sleeping and trying to have sex.  It was a little frustrating in that it doesn't run as long as I would have liked.The second episode details the science upon which Al's life was based.  The fossil is described, and what it tells us about events in Al's life are pointed out.  In addition from the specific evidence of Al's fossillised skeleton, some general assumptions about allosauruses and their lives are shown, with reference to the modern day descendants of dinosaurs.  This episode explains why the previous didn't go as long as I would have liked - because they only showed what could be justified.  If they'd made things up, there could have been more - but everything in the first episode is justified in this.The recreation of dinosaurs is better in this show is better than its predecessor - certainly in regard to their interaction.  In the original series, we either had groups of dinosaurs carrying out similar activities or small number interacting.  In this one, for example, the scene of several allosuruses attacking a herd of diplodicuses is wonderful, and I think better than could have been achieved in the original.If you like 'Walking with Dinosaurs', this may suit you - always provided, of course, that you are happy to deal with a smaller focus.",4,A big bite from the Jurassic,986601600,"04 7, 2001",2001,1724,"['follow-up', 'BBC', 'wonderful', ""'Walking"", 'Dinosaurs', 'series', 'two', 'part', 'video', 'life', 'Big', 'Al', 'fossil', 'allosaurus', 'Jurassic', 'era', 'Here', 'Australia', 'was', 'called', ""'The"", 'Ballad', 'Big', ""Al'.The"", 'first', 'episode', 'life', 'Big', 'Al', 'life', 'seven', 'years', 'birth', 'death', 'Al', 'full', 'life', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'easy', 'one', 'get', 'see', 'aspects', 'Al', 'life', 'predator', 'prey', 'eating', 'sleeping', 'trying', 'have', 'sex', 'was', 'little', 'frustrating', ""n't"", 'run', 'as', 'long', 'would', 'have', 'liked.The', 'second', 'episode', 'details', 'science', 'Al', 'life', 'was', 'based', 'fossil', 'described', 'what', 'events', 'Al', 'life', 'are', 'pointed', 'out', 'addition', 'specific', 'evidence', 'Al', 'fossillised', 'skeleton', 'general', 'assumptions', 'allosauruses', 'lives', 'are', 'shown', 'reference', 'modern', 'day', 'descendants', 'dinosaurs', 'episode', 'why', 'previous', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'as', 'long', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'only', 'showed', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'justified', ""'d"", 'made', 'things', 'up', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'everything', 'first', 'episode', 'justified', 'this.The', 'recreation', 'dinosaurs', 'better', 'show', 'better', 'predecessor', 'certainly', 'regard', 'interaction', 'original', 'series', 'either', 'had', 'groups', 'dinosaurs', 'carrying', 'out', 'similar', 'activities', 'small', 'number', 'interacting', 'one', 'example', 'scene', 'several', 'allosuruses', 'attacking', 'herd', 'diplodicuses', 'wonderful', 'think', 'better', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'achieved', 'original.If', ""'Walking"", 'Dinosaurs', 'may', 'suit', 'always', 'provided', 'course', 'are', 'happy', 'deal', 'smaller', 'focus']",Allosaurus: Walking with Dinosaurs Special
572312,A2Y0N656MWUCXU,B000059H6U,Archanubis80,"[13, 15]","The &quot;seventh&quot; episode of the spectacularly successful &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; series, &quot;Allosaurus&quot; - better known as &quot;The Ballad of Big Al&quot; outside the US - is a extraordinary follow-up to that series.  It also served to whet many fans' appetite for the later &quot;Prehistoric Beasts&quot; series.In &quot;Allosaurus&quot;, we followed the life of &quot;Big Al&quot; literally from birth to the grave.  Life wasn't all &quot;blood in tooth and claw&quot; for the top predator in Jurassic America, as we're shown.  As a baby, Al had to watch for predators, especially his own kind!  He had to literally teach himself to hunt, and some prey was just too big to take on without help.  And mating was no pinic either; Al needs more than flowers to win a female's heart.As a sequel of sorts to &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot;, &quot;Allosaurus&quot; does quite well.  We're treated to the same CGI and animatronic effects seen in the previous series, and while the puppetry still needs a little work, IMHO, the CGI is top notch.  All of the dinosaurs featured in the episode &quot;Time of the Titans&quot; - Diplodocus, Brachiosaurus, and Stegosaurus - return here.  Three more dinosaurs are added to the cast; Dryosaurus, Othnelia, and the famous Apatosaurus.  As with &quot;Dinosaurs&quot;, there is a &quot;Making of...&quot; episode, included on the VHS, giving us insight into the research of what is one of the most recognizable predatory dinosaurs, second only to Tyrannosaurus and Velociraptor.While &quot;Allosaurus&quot; is a wonderful series, I do have one little complaint.  Surely the Framestore and BBC teams could have added a few more dinosaurs to the episode.  They didn't need to have added more sauropods; three is enough.  But what about Ceratosaurus, or Camptosaurus, both contemparies of Allosaurus?  Surely both these dinosaurs could have been included, especially since its likely Ceratosaurus could have competed with Allosaurus for the same food source.Despite this &quot;flaw&quot;, &quot;Allosaurus&quot; is a fine follow-up to &quot;Dinosaurs&quot;.  Part of the continuing &quot;Walking with...&quot; series, which now includes &quot;Prehistoric Beasts&quot;, &quot;Chased by Dinosaurs&quot;, and now &quot;Walking with Cavemen&quot;, &quot;Allosaurus&quot; definately belongs in anyone's collection.

This time,they have a real storyline,although it`s just a documentary film. And the dinosaurs seems a lot more full of life,although their look isn`t different. It`s a pity these series were not included in the book.I this 30-minute special,we follow the allosaurus named Al from beeing an egg to his death. In fact,this could truly have been the life of an allosaur. But there are still a few things which I don`t understand (and it has happend TOO many times in &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot;): why does he always start arguing with a female of his own kind?Why didn`t they let him fight another male to get the female instead?That would have been a little more realistic (and a more usual thing to happen in the dinosaur world as well).Well,I know the filmmakers weren`t made out of cash,but I think this documentary could have been a little longer - 30 minutes was too short. It should have been about an hour. Then we would probably have had more time too learn about Al`s dangerous and wondrous world,and the fantastic creatures living there.Still,I think this was a very nice addition to BBC`s most expensive project so far,and it is recommended watching both for dino-loving kids as well as for adults and anyone interested in dinosaurs &amp; computer animations.",4,Better than the usual BBC,1011398400,"01 19, 2002",2002,1389,"['Well', 'have', 'say', 'have', 'seen', 'one', 'was', 'better', 'usual', 'quot', 'Walking', 'Dinosaurs', 'quot', 'time', 'have', 'real', 'storyline', 's', 'just', 'documentary', 'film', 'dinosaurs', 'lot', 'more', 'full', 'life', 'look', 'isn', 't', 'different', 's', 'pity', 'series', 'were', 'not', 'included', 'book.I', '30-minute', 'special', 'follow', 'allosaurus', 'named', 'Al', 'beeing', 'egg', 'death', 'fact', 'could', 'truly', 'have', 'been', 'life', 'allosaur', 'are', 'still', 'few', 'things', 'don', 't', 'understand', 'happend', 'TOO', 'many', 'times', 'quot', 'Walking', 'Dinosaurs', 'quot', 'why', 'always', 'start', 'arguing', 'female', 'own', 'kind', 'Why', 'didn', 'let', 'fight', 'male', 'get', 'female', 'instead', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'more', 'realistic', 'more', 'usual', 'thing', 'happen', 'dinosaur', 'world', 'well', '.Well', 'know', 'filmmakers', 'weren', 't', 'made', 'cash', 'think', 'documentary', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'longer', '30', 'minutes', 'was', 'too', 'short', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'hour', 'Then', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'time', 'too', 'learn', 'Al', 's', 'dangerous', 'wondrous', 'world', 'fantastic', 'creatures', 'living', 'there.Still', 'think', 'was', 'very', 'nice', 'addition', 'BBC', 's', 'most', 'expensive', 'project', 'so', 'far', 'recommended', 'watching', 'dino-loving', 'kids', 'as', 'well', 'adults', 'anyone', 'interested', 'dinosaurs', 'amp', 'computer', 'animations']",Allosaurus: Walking with Dinosaurs Special

572319,A356HRZZFCEGL1,B000059H6U,"John Panagopoulos ""John Andrew Panagopoulos""","[0, 0]","***This review may contain spoilers**As another reviewer has already mentioned, ""Allosaurus: A Walking with Dinosaurs Special"" (hereafter ""Allo"") is essentially the seventh episode of that magnificent pseudo-documentary series, and maintains that series lofty production and narrative standards (including retaining Kenneth Branaugh as solemn narrator).  I think ""Allo"" was created in response to some ineffable clamor for carnivore balance.  In other words, T-rex had his own episode on ""Walking with Dinosaurs""; now it's Allosaurus's turn to shine.The first 30 minutes of ""Allo"" chronicles the relatively short but painfully eventful life of an Allosaurus, christened ""Big Al"".  We follow his life from a tiny hatchling to a nearly full-grown subadult. He encounters stegosaurs.  He participates in a rousing diploducus hunt with others of his kind.  He attempts to woo a much larger, more mature, and definitely more ferocious female allosaur.  Throughout his life, Big Al was basically the carnivorous theropod's answer to Evel Knievel.  He suffered bites, scratches, lacerations, and bone dislocations, especially to his feet and legs.  The litany of injuries finally takes its toll on Big Al, eventually losing his hunting ability and succumbing to starvation and thirst.As I was watching ""Allo"", I was astonished by many things.  For example, how did a hatchling the size of a pigeon grow to be a 3-4 ton apex predator?  Also, where did Big Al's mother get her maternal instinct, enabling her to protect her brood like a mother crocodile from predators, including, unsuccessfully, against a cannibalistic male allosaur?  How many of Big Al's nest mates survived along with him (probably not too many; allosaur chicks, like croc babies, probably had a very high mortality rate)?  Did Allosaurs really cooperate to take down gigantic prey like Diplodocus?  Did sexual dimorphism really exist among allosaurs, meaning size differences among the sexes, in this case females larger than males? Some of these questions are addressed in the second 30-minute half of ""Allo"", where fossil analysis speculates upon Big Al's life and provided inspiration for the first half.One thing stood out prominently in ""Allo"": Big Al and his ilk may have been at the top of the food chain during the Jurassic, but their lives were far from easy.  Despite their size, allosaurs must have had a tough time against the larger herbivores.  As I recall, Big Al meets two stegosaurs but decides not to attack them, probably because of their sharp spiked tails and aggressive posture.  During the thrilling diplodocus hunt on the salt flats, it takes three(!) allosaurs, including Big Al several hours to bring down even a sick, overheated member of the herd.  Even after they start to consume the multi-ton carcass, a bigger female allosaurus arrives and threatens to claim the kill as her own.  Speaking of females, Big Al's clumsy attempt to woo a female allosaurus literally ends in crushing failure.  Most importantly, an allosaurus's feet and legs were its fortune; any serious damage to either could spell doom.  Big Al breaks one of his middle toes while chasing one of the bipedal, relatively small Dryosaurs - a fatal wound for any hunter, but especially a two-legged one.Both halves of the ""Allo"" disk provide intriguing scientific, paleontological, and zoological information about Big Al and his world.  Of course, some of this information is speculative, which may put off some viewers, just as it may have done with the ""Walking..."" series.

The story is about his life, which was only 15 years long.  60 minutes, half of which is the story and half of which is about how they figured out what they did from the bones.I kind of feel sorry for Big Al.

I used to imagine what it would have been like when those skeletons I saw on exhibit lived, and how someone needed to play tour guide to that realm and how I should twist the handle. Sadly, no matter how I tried that doorway, it always remained closed, my time machine not quite working the way I would have intended, and dinosaurs were left either in bone formation or in the movies as monsters.There was never an in-between.With the creation of the Walking With Dinosaurs series, however, everything began to change and I, still that boy with an interest in that hobby, found myself addicted. The key that separated this series and made it ""unique"" - a word I try to use sparingly - is in the way the dinosaurs, our main actors and actresses, are portrayed. Instead of turning then into a depiction of a colossal, toothy menace or dryly discussing their lifespan in the way one discusses ancient relics, the series showcases dinosaurs by allowing one to walk with them through their terrain. From the flora and the fauna, the insect life and dinosaurs themselves, a depiction of CGI effects, prosthetics, and of ""dinosaur knowing"" comes to life. Here, you see the landscape the way it would have been, the animals roaming free and observed naturalistically, and the experience is incredible because it looks so vibrantly realistic.In Allosaurus: A Walking With Dinosaurs Special, the Allosaurus ""Big Al"" is showcased as he struggles from the cradle while trying to grow into something fearsome. In sixty minutes, the fifteen years from the egg to the eventual demise it faces are depicted, showing a person that going to the head of the class wasn't easy in that age.  Here, other dinosaurs walk as well, and the efforts of one of the top predators of its age seem a tad on the hard side - making me rethink the allure of being the biggest kid on the block. Survival while growing, it is dramatic and enlightening experience, and its pretty interesting how harrowing an introduction can be and how brutal it can be.For anyone that has yet to watch this series, I'd recommend tuning in as soon as possible and catching up on all those moments you missed out on. I would recommend starting with Walking With Dinosaurs, however, and moving on from there. Still, that is far from being a bad thing. Besides this video that focuses on Big Al and a few of species, other DVDs house other forms of life that are entrancing. Wonderfully fast predators, Megladons swimming the high tides and eating enough to be interesting, and other strange species await you.

Kids become motivated to learn -- and they do learn -- when they are challenged to understand what's going on around them.
