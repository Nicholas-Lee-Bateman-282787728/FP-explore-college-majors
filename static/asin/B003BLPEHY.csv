I ordered it for downloadand, after charging me, Amazon informed me that it was not compatible with my Mac. (What century are you guys living in, half the population owns Macs.)  Now they are saying a DVD-R release is coming. No regular release? Why? I'll tell you why. Because whoever is in charge of these decisions is probably 25 - 30 years old and has no idea that this Sokko is popular and personally thinks its terrible. The fact that BCI's Ultraman DVD's didn't do as well as hoped may also be a factor. Ofcourse the the fact that the Ultraman DVD's were of bootleg quality,and that BCI fed the buyers all sorts of lies explaining why they were so bad, is probably not known to MGM/Fox.I know that they have good prints of Johnny Sokko. I have seen a couple.They are not exactly the same as the original broadcast versions, but they were definitely taken from the same prints or inter-negativesthat the originals were.I really, I really want this. Johnny Sokko, and Ultraman are my favorite show's of all time, and I know a lot of other people who feel the same way.Why do the keep cheating us?I'm praying that we don't get cheated by Fox, the way that we got cheated by BCI.",5,Great!!

You are reviewing a product that doesn't exist just based on the generalities surrounding the source material.  This should not be a review of show itself but of this DVD release of the show.  There are several different listings for Johnny Sokko DVDs and these reviews would be applicable to any of them if you are just reviewing the series.  These reviews should be about the specific products listed so people can deceide if they want to buy them or not.

Your bubble is about to go..............POP!!!!.Go to AV Maniacs DVD forum and you will see that MGM has ended their MOD for a second time!!! Please notice, that Amazon is no longer taking orders for this. More bad news. MGM has started leasing some of their catalog titles to the worse budget label ever-----TGG Direct  AKA Tiger Direct. Check out Amazons listing for The Dr. Goldfoot Double Feature DVD, the company releasing info lists MGM/TGG. These are already in some Walmarts and K-marts.Now the good news.  MGM has licensed ""some"" of their catalog to the great DVD label Shout Factory. ""Terrorvision"" is one of the titles. AV Maniacs and a few other DVD forums have a more complete list.My suggestion is to send a email to Shout Factory and asked them to release this great fun show. I would also suggest that if they can get the rights from MGM, to include ""Voyage Into Space"" which is a movie version of Johnny Sokko made up from the first few episodes. ""Voyage Into Space"" is how some of us got into Johnny Sokko since where I lived in the 70's we didn't get the show.  MGM has truly frustrated many fan , like me, with the constant ""we're going to release this, OH! no we're not"". I wish studios that use the MOD method of releasing their older films on DVD would wake up and realize that charging $19.99-$24.99 for DVD-r's is too much. $9.99-11.99 is about right for a MOD DVD-r barebones release.",1,Bubble bursting time!!!!,1347667200,"09 15, 2012",2012,1436,"['Grab', 'hold', 'something', 'bubble', 'go', '..POP', '.Go', 'AV', 'Maniacs', 'DVD', 'forum', 'will', 'see', 'MGM', 'ended', 'MOD', 'second', 'time', 'Please', 'notice', 'Amazon', 'no', 'longer', 'taking', 'orders', 'More', 'bad', 'news', 'MGM', 'started', 'leasing', 'catalog', 'titles', 'worse', 'budget', 'label', 'ever', '-TGG', 'Direct', 'AKA', 'Tiger', 'Direct', 'Check', 'out', 'Amazons', 'listing', 'Dr.', 'Goldfoot', 'Double', 'Feature', 'DVD', 'company', 'releasing', 'info', 'lists', 'MGM/TGG', 'are', 'already', 'Walmarts', 'K-marts.Now', 'good', 'news', 'MGM', 'licensed', 'catalog', 'great', 'DVD', 'label', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'Terrorvision', 'one', 'titles', 'AV', 'Maniacs', 'few', 'other', 'DVD', 'forums', 'have', 'more', 'complete', 'list.My', 'suggestion', 'send', 'email', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'asked', 'release', 'great', 'fun', 'show', 'would', 'also', 'suggest', 'can', 'get', 'rights', 'MGM', 'include', 'Voyage', 'Into', 'Space', 'movie', 'version', 'Johnny', 'Sokko', 'made', 'up', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'Voyage', 'Into', 'Space', 'how', 'got', 'Johnny', 'Sokko', 'where', 'lived', '70', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'show', 'MGM', 'truly', 'frustrated', 'many', 'fan', 'constant', ""'re"", 'going', 'release', 'OH', ""'re"", 'not', 'wish', 'studios', 'use', 'MOD', 'method', 'releasing', 'older', 'films', 'DVD', 'would', 'wake', 'up', 'realize', 'charging', '19.99-', '24.99', 'DVD-r', 'too', 'much', '9.99-11.99', 'about', 'right', 'MOD', 'DVD-r', 'barebones', 'release']",Johnny Sokko and His Flying Robot MGM Collection

MGM/Fox have really dropped the ball here. This could have been a deluxe box set, maybe a Bandai type mini figure could have been included, bonus features - Photos, commentaries..NO! The packaging looks like ""I don't care, it's only a Japanese TV show"". Heaven knows what the picture quality is going to look like? Take a look at what other studios are putting out Fox. Sony have been doing superb work with their titles. While some of the indie studios are doing superb work, too, Severin and Synapse comes to mind here!
