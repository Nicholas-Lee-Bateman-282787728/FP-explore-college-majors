Nicholas Cage delivers an outstanding performance as Jack, a hollow capitalist. Tea Leoni is his former girlfriend who he married in the ""glimpse"". At first he fights the whole thing, then he becomes used to his other life and wants to stay there. Cage has lots of funny lines, but the idea is tired. The contrived ending also spoils it a bit, but overall it is an enjoyable movie. I think it could have been more original and provocative if it had been the other way around: if Cage had been the husband and father given a glimpse of what he could have been if he had gone for the career and all the trappings. Now that would have been good, but it would have destroyed that sentimental, holiday theme.

582944,AVAHA06K08ZKK,B00005JCCC,Alwyn Lau,"[4, 5]","""Don't screw up the best thing in your life just because you're a little unsure about who you are.""I don't know how many married guys can recall it, but I know the exact time I decided to finally take the plunge with my then-girlfriend (now my wife). It was about an hour after I watched Nicolas Cage's Family Man, a full-wonder story about a wealthy Wall Street guy, Jack, given a glimpse of the non-wealthy life he could have lived had he not gotten on a plane and be separated from his then-girlfriend almost 2 decades ago.The transitional moments, from big-time dealer to small-time salesman, are hilarious. Used to waking up alone or with girls he just met, Jack wakes up with a wife and two kids and a dog jumping all over him. He rushes away to his sky-scraper to see his name - next to President - replaced by his junior. He tries to get into premium condo but the doorman doesn't recognize him and blocks his entrance. He struggles to change his baby son's, Josh, diapers. He has to ask his daugher, Annie, what the after-school S.O.Ps' are. He curses when his junior appears on TV shaking hands with a two corporate presidents whose merger his (ex-)company has arranged.But then Jack learns - or discovers - the joy of loving and living in spite of financial want, in spite of the no-cushion savings, in spite of not having that suit which makes him ""feel like a man"" (but which requires taking out his kids' education fund). He misses his trappings of status but grows to love Kate, Annie and Josh more than anything in the world. The quote at the start, by Arnie his friend, captures Jack's seizing and holding on to a family he knows he loves without having to figure out entirely this new world he's been thrown into.Sorrow beckons, though, when he realises he has to 'leave' this dream-like alternate reality which he started out hating but ended up cherishing. When the moment comes, it's full of dread, because he's back to his old super-wealthy but no-family life. He drives to the house belong to ""him and Kate"" but there's just a guy there who doesn't know any Kate. The real Kate is now a hot-shot lawyer, who's just packing up and about to transfer to Paris.Final drama arrives when Jack rushes to the airport looking for Kate, and trying to stop her before she flies off. Remember we are already in the ""real world"" and Jack has stopped 'dreaming'.He creates some commotion because Kate is already at the departure gate and about to board, and she keeps saying, ""Jack, do you need closure?"" which is probably what any woman would say if her boyfriend from 15 years ago, started pestering her about what ""could have been"". Kate then turns towards the gate and walks away. Jack is about to give up when he suddenly turns to Kate and desperately cries out to describe the alternate reality he's lived through with an alternate her:""We have a house in Jersey. We have two kids, Annie and Josh. Annie's not much of a violin player, but she tries real hard. She's a little precocious, but that's only because she says what's on her mind. And when she smiles...""And Josh, he has your eyes. He doesn't say much, but we know he's smart. He's always got his eyes open, he's always watching us. Sometimes you can look at him and you just know he's learning something new. It's like witnessing a miracle.""The house is a mess but it's ours. After 122 more payments, it's going to be ours. And you, you're a non-profit lawyer. That's right, you're completely non-profit, but that doesn't seem to bother you.""And we're in love. After 13 years of marriage we're still unbelievably in love. You won't even let me touch you until I've said it. I sing to you. Not all the time, but definitely on special occasions. We've dealt with our share of surprises and made a lot of sacrifices but we've stayed together.""You see, you're a better person than I am. And it made me a better person to be around you. I don't know, maybe it was just all a dream. Maybe I went to bed one lonely night in December and I imagined it all. But I swear, nothing has ever felt more real.""And if you get on that plane right now, it'll disappear forever. I know we could both go on with our lives and we'd both be fine, but I've seen what we could be like together. And I choose us.""Little did Cage & Co. know that six years later, there would be another movie with another husband, another wife and another two kids (plus another dog which looked like the dog in Family Man). This movie is also about family and getting a glimpse into a major What-If. Whilst Cage started out in a scenario he did enjoy and ended back in the same situation he later detested, the main character of this movie starts out being ""tired with his life"", but ends back in the same situation an entirely changed man, thoroughly grateful for the life he has (as opposed to the life he thought he had lost).I'm talking about Adam Sandler's Click. But I won't ruin two movies at one go (smile), so I'll end with the theme which unites these two masterpieces: Family is first, the job is completely secondary. Never take for granted the ones who love you, no matter what riches beckon and no matter how attractive alternatives may appear to be.",5,Family First - Always,1174262400,"03 19,

I have found myself smitten by a few (most surprisingly was that Zac Efron vehicle, `17 Again') and yet with every charming and refreshing take there is most certainly a slew of films that just come up short.  For me, `The Family Man' kind of gets it, and still it kind of doesn't.  Nicolas Cage does a respectable job, given his knack for stagnant emotional consistency.  I was shocked that he handled the character with balance, considering my usually disappointment with his lack of emotional development (why so serious all the time?).  The film though, cannot come into its own.  The premise is too candy coated and too predictably manipulated to really be anything more than a desperate attempt at box-office sympathies.  The cast is commendable, especially Tea Leoni (who deserves a better career), but in the end nothing can really rescue this forgettable film.

This is a movie for anyone who has ever wondered, &quot;What if I made different choices in life.&quot;Why this movie wasn't nominated for an Oscar is beyond me, but it is indeed a great film which the whole family will surely enjoy.",5,ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL,989452800,"05 10, 2001",2001,861,"['saw', 'movie', 'theatre', 'just', 'Christmas', 'have', 'say', 'one', 'best', 'romantic', 'drama/fantasy', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'once', 'again', 'acting', 'skills', 'are', 'second', 'none', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Tea', 'Leoni', 'better', 'role.Cage', 'character', 'rich', 'hard-working', 'businessman', 'time', 'real', 'relationship', 'ex-finacee', 'phone', 'number', 'chose', 'leave', 'order', 'accept', 'job', 'offer', 'years', 'before.A', ""'guardian"", 'angel', 'sorts', 'chance', 'take', 'glimpse', 'how', 'life', 'would', 'be', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'plane', 'result', 'phenomenal', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'wondered', 'quot', 'What', 'made', 'different', 'choices', 'life.', 'quot', 'Why', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'indeed', 'great', 'film', 'whole', 'family', 'will', 'surely', 'enjoy']",N/A

After defusing a potentially violent situation at a convenience store, Cage is given a ""glimpse"" of what his life could've been had he not flown off to London thirteen years earlier. The gun-toting mini-mart customer (Don Cheadle as an angel?) who was unable to cash a winning lottery ticket tells Cage that the transformation is coming, but it will only be temporary. When he awakens the next morning, Cage finds he's now married to the girl left behind all those years earlier (Tea Leoni); she's now a pro-bono attorney. In this alternate universe, he's a salesman at her father's tire and parts store.Leoni and Cage have two adorable kids and a big fluffy dog. They pay mortgage on a snug home in a blue collar New Jersey neighborhood. Cage's new routine is well-defined for him: selling tires with the help of a bottle hidden in a desk drawer, bowling with the guys once a week, walking the dog late at night, mall-browsing on Saturdays, taking care of the kids on alternate work days, lifting a few with an admiring best friend (Jeremy Piven), making love with his wife if time or opportunity permit, etc.At first the shock of going from single to married, from Ferrari to mini-van, from super-rich to lower middle class overwhelms him, but after a while Cage comes to love his new family and full life. That's why when Cheadle suddenly reappears to send him back to wealth, Wall Street and lonely singledom, he doesn't want to go.A real heart-tugger, especially after Cage is returned to his first existence. It's a personal fave that's highly recommended!.Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.(6.6) The Family Man (2000) - Nicolas Cage/Tea Leoni/Don Cheadle/Jeremy Piven/Saul Rubinek/Josef Sommer/Makenzie Vega/Harve Presnell/Mary Beth Hurt",5,"Kate: ""How can you do that?"" --- Jack: ""What?"" --- Kate: ""Look at me like you haven't seen me every day for the last 13 years.""",1339804800,"06 16, 2012",2012,2168,"['Directed', 'Brett', 'Ratner', 'THE', 'FAMILY', 'MAN', 'Christmas', 'time', 'fantasy', 'new', 'twist', 'Frank', ""Capra'sIT"", 'A', 'WONDERFUL', 'LIFE', '1946', 'doing', 'so', 'messiness', 'modern', 'filmmaking', 'CGI', 'shakicam', 'explosions', 'mayhem', 'bodily', 'harm', 'here..In', 'gentle', 'comedy', 'Nick', 'Cage', 'high', 'power', 'Wall', 'Street', 'exec', 'who', 'verge', 'closing', 'multi-billion', 'dollar', 'deal', 'defusing', 'potentially', 'violent', 'situation', 'convenience', 'store', 'Cage', 'given', 'glimpse', 'what', 'life', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'had', 'not', 'flown', 'off', 'London', 'thirteen', 'years', 'earlier', 'gun-toting', 'mini-mart', 'customer', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'angel', 'who', 'was', 'unable', 'cash', 'winning', 'lottery', 'ticket', 'tells', 'Cage', 'transformation', 'coming', 'will', 'only', 'be', 'temporary', 'When', 'next', 'morning', 'Cage', 'now', 'married', 'girl', 'left', 'years', 'earlier', 'Tea', 'Leoni', 'now', 'pro-bono', 'attorney', 'alternate', 'universe', 'salesman', 'father', 'tire', 'parts', 'store.Leoni', 'Cage', 'have', 'two', 'adorable', 'kids', 'big', 'fluffy', 'dog', 'pay', 'mortgage', 'snug', 'home', 'blue', 'collar', 'New', 'Jersey', 'neighborhood', 'Cage', 'new', 'routine', 'well-defined', 'selling', 'tires', 'help', 'bottle', 'hidden', 'desk', 'drawer', 'bowling', 'guys', 'once', 'week', 'walking', 'dog', 'late', 'night', 'mall-browsing', 'Saturdays', 'taking', 'care', 'kids', 'alternate', 'work', 'days', 'lifting', 'few', 'admiring', 'best', 'friend', 'Jeremy', 'Piven', 'making', 'love', 'wife', 'time', 'opportunity', 'permit', 'first', 'shock', 'going', 'single', 'married', 'Ferrari', 'mini-van', 'super-rich', 'lower', 'middle', 'class', 'overwhelms', 'while', 'Cage', 'love', 'new', 'family', 'full', 'life', 'why', 'when', 'Cheadle', 'suddenly', 'send', 'back', 'wealth', 'Wall', 'Street', 'lonely', 'singledom', ""n't"", 'want', 'go.A', 'real', 'heart-tugger', 'especially', 'Cage', 'returned', 'first', 'existence', 'personal', 'fave', 'highly', 'recommended', '.Parenthetical', 'number', 'preceding', 'title', '1', '10', 'IMDb', 'viewer', 'poll', 'rating', '6.6', 'Family', 'Man', '2000', 'Nicolas', 'Cage/Tea', 'Leoni/Don', 'Cheadle/Jeremy', 'Piven/Saul', 'Rubinek/Josef', 'Sommer/Makenzie', 'Vega/Harve', 'Presnell/Mary', 'Beth', 'Hurt']",N/A

He is introduced as a robber with a foul mouth, while Charley was a nice drunk, but they both have their bells.  Anyway, in the end, Charley earned his angel wings, but Don?

There's no stereotypical situation.  Even the stock suburban Jersey characters are handled with normalcy.  Every situation is portrayed with realism and honesty.  The story line is solely based on Mr. Cage's character's view point.  It feels real because he's not immediately embracing his family lifestyle.  Through out the better part of the movie, he wanted to go back to his high-flying life as a single Wall Street player.  The change of heart is so subtle and skillfully handled by the screenwriters that you are totally convinced by the time he realized what he missed from his 'glimpsed' life with Miss Leoni and the kids.Miss Leoni is very believable in wardrobe and demeanor as an Ivy-league educated attorney turned into a Jersey wife.  She's not perfectly made-up, not a stick, and has a real glow and happiness as a wife and a mother (could it be the happy marriage with Mr. Duchovney and having two kids in real life?).  And the chemistry between Mr. Cage and Miss Leoni is palpable to say the least.Watching the movie and listening to Mr. Ratner and his producer's commentary really enforced my belief in making movies with passion.  The passion expressed by Mr. Ratner and the producer was so heart-felt, it gives me hope for greater things to come from them.To me the realness of this movie is in its ending.  Mr. Cage, after his blissful 'glimpse' of what could have been, tried to track down Miss Leoni in real life, who is a successful attorney also on a fast track, to give the love they once shared one more try (did I spoil the movie by revealing this?).  Like what the filmmakers said in the making-of documentary, Mr. Cage only asked Miss Leoni for a cup of coffee and they left the audience there imagining the possible outcomes.  They, as filmmakers, did not try to turn this story into a fairy tale.  Today's movie goers are sophisticated enough to know when a story is manipulative or not.  :)It may be too late for Mr. Cage and Miss Leoni's characters to develop a life together like in Mr. Cage's glimpse.  But it's never too late for us viewers to take stock of our life and determine what really matters.",5,This movie surprised me!!,1018915200,"04 16, 2002",2002,2279,"['Who', 'could', 'imagine', 'movie', 'directed', 'Mr.', 'Brett', 'Ratner', 'Rush', 'Hour', 'directors', 'world', 'can', 'be', 'subtle', 'moving', 'experience', 'stereotypical', 'situation', 'Even', 'stock', 'suburban', 'Jersey', 'characters', 'are', 'handled', 'normalcy', 'situation', 'portrayed', 'realism', 'honesty', 'story', 'line', 'solely', 'based', 'Mr.', 'Cage', 'character', 'view', 'point', 'real', 'not', 'immediately', 'embracing', 'family', 'lifestyle', 'better', 'part', 'movie', 'wanted', 'go', 'back', 'high-flying', 'life', 'single', 'Wall', 'Street', 'player', 'change', 'heart', 'so', 'subtle', 'skillfully', 'handled', 'screenwriters', 'are', 'totally', 'convinced', 'time', 'realized', 'what', 'missed', ""'glimpsed"", 'life', 'Miss', 'Leoni', 'kids.Miss', 'Leoni', 'very', 'believable', 'wardrobe', 'demeanor', 'Ivy-league', 'educated', 'attorney', 'turned', 'Jersey', 'wife', 'not', 'perfectly', 'made-up', 'not', 'stick', 'real', 'glow', 'happiness', 'wife', 'mother', 'could', 'be', 'happy', 'marriage', 'Mr.', 'Duchovney', 'having', 'two', 'kids', 'real', 'life', 'chemistry', 'Mr.', 'Cage', 'Miss', 'Leoni', 'palpable', 'say', 'least.Watching', 'movie', 'listening', 'Mr.', 'Ratner', 'producer', 'commentary', 'really', 'enforced', 'belief', 'making', 'movies', 'passion', 'passion', 'expressed', 'Mr.', 'Ratner', 'producer', 'was', 'so', 'heart-felt', 'hope', 'greater', 'things', 'come', 'realness', 'movie', 'ending', 'Mr.', 'Cage', 'blissful', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'tried', 'track', 'down', 'Miss', 'Leoni', 'real', 'life', 'who', 'successful', 'attorney', 'also', 'fast', 'track', 'give', 'love', 'once', 'shared', 'one', 'more', 'try', 'did', 'spoil', 'movie', 'revealing', 'what', 'filmmakers', 'said', 'making-of', 'documentary', 'Mr.', 'Cage', 'only', 'asked', 'Miss', 'Leoni', 'cup', 'coffee', 'left', 'audience', 'there', 'imagining', 'possible', 'outcomes', 'filmmakers', 'did', 'not', 'try', 'turn', 'story', 'fairy', 'tale', 'Today', 'movie', 'goers', 'are', 'sophisticated', 'enough', 'know', 'when', 'story', 'manipulative', 'not', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'late', 'Mr.', 'Cage', 'Miss', 'Leoni', 'characters', 'develop', 'life', 'together', 'Mr.', 'Cage', 'glimpse', 'never', 'too', 'late', 'viewers', 'take', 'stock', 'life', 'determine', 'what', 'really', 'matters']",N/A

Everyone is afraid of (1) not having enough TIME with their kids and (2) not having ENOUGH money.  This message that I derived from this movie has stuck with me since seeing the film many years ago. It's a fun movie that is good to watch with older kids during Christmas time but for me, it is better than fun.  It's really made me think about how many nice people are considered working middle class who don't have a lot to show for it but they're not stupider than people who financially better off.  So what's missing from our country's culture that there are so many working families when America is still known as the Land of Opportunity and the top pick for immigration?  I think we should be specifically supporting everyone who is working poor or officially middle class to get their kids into the medical profession not the high finance and legal professions.  Medical studies should be part of the core curriculum.  It doesn't matter if kids take a shorter program in nursing if they don't feel confident about doing a long stint in medical school.  If your son loves GI JOE, let him know that he can win more battles if he can perform triage on the battlefield.  Nurses can make a low 6 figure salary.  Doctors can make a middle to high 6 figure salary just as a private practitioner seeing 18.5 patients per day.  I look around and I think Americans are too smart to not be earning more on average.  We need more/most kids to become medical professions.  It's the course of study that will enrich your personal life not just your professional one.  Another thing that this movie made me think about is the good that China's One Child Policy brought about because when citizens simply don't enjoy the quality of life of the American Dream, people really shouldn't be thinking about making big families until the would-be parents are in a secure place in their own lives.

It's not as universally well-regarded as it is here, but I'm considered pretty fussy when it comes to giving good ratings, and I'm torn between a 4 or a 5. Perhaps it's got a little to do with my low expectations; I passed on it after its lukewarm reviews and watched it only because of my sister's glowing report.Mostly, though, it's because it's an excellent, affecting film. It could have been played strictly as the contrivance it was, written by the numbers, but the writers did their job. They did what Josh Whedon and David E. Kelly do so well, which is find and mine the real human emotions that would occur in an otherwise outlandish situation. Brett Ratner, for his part, managed to elicit just the right notes out of Cage and Leoni (who's never looked more ravishing; my god), two actors who do well on their own, but their best with the right director. This is definitely Leoni's best performance, and one of Cage's.

We had certificates for Jim Carrey's ""How The Grinch Stole Christmas"", but we weren't in the mood for that, so we snuck into the theater that was playing this. I have no regrets as this movie made me hold my fiance a little bit tighter that night. Life is about choices, and Jack Campbell has to make that decision when his girlfriend tries to talk him out of going to Oxford University to pursue a financial scholarship, and begin life with her then and now. Kate is a beautiful girl, and Jack is caught between a rock and a hard place, and ends up leaving her at the airport, and goes onto success on Wall Street, but his life is lonely, and he has no one to love him in that special way. He's made aware of this when one night on the way home he is acosted by a gun toting criminal, and more or less Jack is made to review his life, and Jack just blows him off, and goes home to bed, and then he wakes up married to Kate, and is a father of 2. They live in a house in Jersey, and Jack works for Kate's uncle at a tire store. Jack is not sure of how to deal with this, and at first he doesn't believe this is happening, but as time goes on he begins to love Kate, and his children. However, the dream ends and Jack wakes up alone. He got a note from Kate to see him again, and now he wonders what's up. It turns out that Kate has done well for herself, and she just wants Jack to pick up his stuff before she moves to her new home.....Jack can't believe how beautiful Kate looks, and now feels like he has to make a move somehow, however, this time he makes the right decision, and stays with Kate. I am not much into romantic movies, but this is one of my 5 favorite romantic movies, and as I said I held my fiance a little bit tighter that night.

Litton,"[1, 2]","&quot;The Family Man&quot; is a holiday film about a man who gets a glimpse at what his life would be like had he not taken &quot;the road less traveled.&quot; While the film is nowhere near the magnificence and grandeur of such Christmas classics as &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot; or &quot;It's a Wonderful Life,&quot; from which it borrows certain plot elements, it retains a great deal of charm that quickly grows on you, and by the time the credits rolled, I was completely hooked.As the film opens, Jack Campbell (Nicolas Cage) and his girlfriend, Kate (Tea Leoni), are embracing at the airport as he prepares to depart for London to take part in the first big business venture of his financial career. She pleads with him not to go, but he promises undying love to her and proceeds, where the film then advances thirteen years later to the present day, and we see that they have drifted apart. Jack is now a wealthy and arrogant businessman, with no visible sign of settling down anytime soon.By not-so-sheer fate, he encounters a would-be thief in a convenience store, who transforms his life into a window of what it may have been had he not boarded the plane to London all those years ago. Jack wakes up on Christmas morning to find himself a husband and father, both of which he is unable to grasp or accept. As time goes on, he gleans what information he can about his &quot;life&quot; with Kate and their children, and the more he learns, the more he becomes attached to his would-be life.To bill the film as a rip-off of &quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot; is unjustifiable. The movie obviously borrows the most popular element of the previous film's story, but while &quot;Life&quot; showed the future in an almost terrifying light, &quot;The Family Man&quot; chooses to cast a much more appealing ray on how things may have been. The result, I assure you, is more interesting than you may think, and while you won't be glued to your seat, you're sure to be satisfied at the very least.To it's credit, it has a lot going for it, mainly from the stellar leads. Nicolas Cage is one of those very unique actors who segues from genre to genre without the slightest sign of complication. Just as we believe in him as an action guru, he is also a warm, sensitive character in his more emotional roles, and this one is no exception. Tea Leoni is beginning to make her mark on Hollywood, and this role provides her a chance to give it all she's got. Here, she shows great emotion and integrity, and she fits the character perfectly.The story is also filled with elements that will appeal mostly to die-hard romantics and even some common followers of the genre. It allows Jack and Kate to build an understanding of one another, and just as he is trying to discover this life he never led, the both of them are coming to a crossroads with one another, at which point their relationship reaches its full bloom. What will happen once Jack is yanked back into a now-harsh reality is a satisfying payoff to the story, one that plays by the rules and succeeds by not being too saccharine or melodramatic.There are some lighthearted moments of comedic jubilance at play, but &quot;The Family Man&quot; is more interesting as a holiday romance than anything else. The performances from Cage and Leoni bring home a wonderfully executed plot about second chances, one that is effective despite its slight lack of originality. The film gave me a warm feeling inside, and that alone is worth recommending it.",4,Full of holiday charm and warm characters.,1003968000,"10 25, 2001",2001,3504,"['quot', 'Family', 'Man', 'quot', 'holiday', 'film', 'man', 'who', 'glimpse', 'what', 'life', 'would', 'be', 'had', 'not', 'taken', 'quot', 'road', 'less', 'traveled.', 'quot', 'film', 'nowhere', 'magnificence', 'grandeur', 'such', 'Christmas', 'classics', 'quot', 'Miracle', '34th', 'Street', 'quot', 'quot', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'quot', 'certain', 'plot', 'elements', 'great', 'deal', 'charm', 'quickly', 'time', 'credits', 'rolled', 'was', 'completely', 'hooked.As', 'film', 'Jack', 'Campbell', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'girlfriend', 'Kate', 'Tea', 'Leoni', 'are', 'embracing', 'airport', 'depart', 'London', 'take', 'part', 'first', 'big', 'business', 'venture', 'financial', 'career', 'not', 'go', 'undying', 'love', 'proceeds', 'where', 'film', 'then', 'thirteen', 'years', 'later', 'present', 'day', 'see', 'have', 'drifted', 'apart', 'Jack', 'now', 'wealthy', 'arrogant', 'businessman', 'visible', 'sign', 'settling', 'down', 'anytime', 'soon.By', 'not-so-sheer', 'fate', 'would-be', 'thief', 'convenience', 'store', 'who', 'life', 'window', 'what', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'not', 'boarded', 'plane', 'London', 'years', 'ago', 'Jack', 'up', 'Christmas', 'morning', 'find', 'husband', 'father', 'unable', 'grasp', 'accept', 'time', 'what', 'information', 'can', 'quot', 'life', 'quot', 'Kate', 'children', 'more', 'more', 'attached', 'would-be', 'life.To', 'bill', 'film', 'rip-off', 'quot', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'quot', 'unjustifiable', 'movie', 'obviously', 'most', 'popular', 'element', 'previous', 'film', 'story', 'quot', 'Life', 'quot', 'showed', 'future', 'almost', 'terrifying', 'light', 'quot', 'Family', 'Man', 'quot', 'cast', 'much', 'more', 'appealing', 'ray', 'how', 'things', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'result', 'assure', 'more', 'interesting', 'may', 'think', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'glued', 'seat', ""'re"", 'sure', 'be', 'satisfied', 'very', 'credit', 'lot', 'going', 'mainly', 'stellar', 'leads', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'one', 'very', 'unique', 'actors', 'who', 'segues', 'genre', 'genre', 'slightest', 'sign', 'complication', 'Just', 'believe', 'action', 'guru', 'also', 'warm', 'sensitive', 'character', 'more', 'emotional', 'roles', 'one', 'exception', 'Tea', 'Leoni', 'beginning', 'make', 'mark', 'Hollywood', 'role', 'chance', 'give', 'got', 'Here', 'great', 'emotion', 'integrity', 'character', 'perfectly.The', 'story', 'also', 'filled', 'elements', 'will', 'appeal', 'mostly', 'die-hard', 'romantics', 'even', 'common', 'followers', 'genre', 'Jack', 'Kate', 'build', 'understanding', 'one', 'just', 'trying', 'discover', 'life', 'never', 'led', 'are', 'coming', 'crossroads', 'one', 'point', 'relationship', 'full', 'bloom', 'What', 'will', 'happen', 'once', 'Jack', 'yanked', 'back', 'now-harsh', 'reality', 'satisfying', 'payoff', 'story', 'one', 'rules', 'not', 'being', 'too', 'saccharine', 'are', 'lighthearted', 'moments', 'comedic', 'jubilance', 'play', 'quot', 'Family', 'Man', 'quot', 'more', 'interesting', 'holiday', 'romance', 'anything', 'else', 'performances', 'Cage', 'Leoni', 'bring', 'home', 'wonderfully', 'executed', 'plot', 'second', 'chances', 'one', 'effective', 'slight', 'lack', 'originality', 'film', 'gave', 'warm', 'feeling', 'inside', 'alone', 'worth', 'recommending']",N/A

This movie is for all of us who have it all but have forgotten or don't know it and are wondering... what if? This is a story of what really matters: sharing life with those you love and measuring success by the quality of one's relationships.The intelligent dialog is scripted in a dramatically direct but believable way, asking the question, ""What if...?"" Jack Campbell (Nicholas Cage), a powerful CEO, is a man who says, ""I have everything I need"" In fact he has more and is content with his life, but oblivious to what he might really own: those things which money can't buy. Inadvertantly, he crosses paths with an angel whose mission it is to test peoples character in their dealing with one another. Touched by a courageous act of Jack's, the angel decides to open Jack's eye's to the wealth he could never earn on Wall Street.Jack Campbell is given a ""glimpse"" of what his life would have been had he married his college sweetheart and had a family. His is forced to live a middle class life. He ignorantly makes the life of his might-have-been family a bit chaotic as he pieces together the events which causes his middle class lifestyle instead of becoming a powerful CEO. He must continue to live this life until he, the man who has ""everything"" he needs, learns what it is that he is missing.What really makes this story special is the reversed mid-life crisis roll of Jack Campbell. Since Jack has everthing he ever wanted it removes the typical mid-life crisis scenario of wanting more which in turn allows the story to more sincerely explore the depths of our human needs.Although, Nicholas Cage's portrail of a powerful executive is slightly off, he is fabulous as the stund middle class father of a family he never had. Especially touching is the how his character learns to overcome his blinding ambition to become the ""envy"" of his peers for the sake of his personal pride. Nonetheless, this movie could not have been as enchanting without Tea Leoni's strong, intelligently and lovingly scripted role. Her character is the woman of our dreams... (And, then there's Tea herself!) If you are a man in your 30's who has never been married for fear of losing yourself and everything you own, you will be inspired to fearlessly entertain the hopes and joys that might be yours.What might we have become if...? Unique is this movies positive outlook to this question. This story submits an alternate answer to those who pridefully insist they will be happy as soon as they accomplish 'something'. It suggests that joy is sharing with one's family life-as-it-is along with their hopes and dreams of what they are still becoming.I left this movie asking myself, ""What have I become"", ""where am I going"" and ""what's really important?""",4,Love Like You Dreamed it: Reversed Mid-Life Crisis,1112313600,"04 1, 2005",2005,2852,"['movie', 'other', 'side', 'passion', ""'It"", 'A', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'age', 'just', 'touching', 'movie', 'who', 'have', 'have', 'forgotten', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'are', 'wondering', 'what', 'story', 'what', 'really', 'matters', 'sharing', 'life', 'love', 'measuring', 'success', 'quality', 'one', 'relationships.The', 'intelligent', 'dialog', 'scripted', 'dramatically', 'direct', 'believable', 'way', 'asking', 'question', 'What', 'Jack', 'Campbell', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'powerful', 'CEO', 'man', 'who', 'have', 'everything', 'need', 'fact', 'more', 'content', 'life', 'oblivious', 'what', 'might', 'really', 'own', 'things', 'money', 'ca', ""n't"", 'buy', 'Inadvertantly', 'paths', 'angel', 'mission', 'test', 'peoples', 'character', 'dealing', 'one', 'Touched', 'courageous', 'act', 'Jack', 'angel', 'open', 'Jack', 'eye', 'wealth', 'could', 'never', 'earn', 'Wall', 'Street.Jack', 'Campbell', 'given', 'glimpse', 'what', 'life', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'married', 'college', 'sweetheart', 'had', 'family', 'forced', 'live', 'middle', 'class', 'life', 'ignorantly', 'life', 'might-have-been', 'family', 'bit', 'chaotic', 'together', 'events', 'middle', 'class', 'lifestyle', 'instead', 'becoming', 'powerful', 'CEO', 'must', 'continue', 'live', 'life', 'man', 'who', 'everything', 'what', 'missing.What', 'really', 'story', 'special', 'reversed', 'mid-life', 'crisis', 'roll', 'Jack', 'Campbell', 'Jack', 'everthing', 'ever', 'wanted', 'typical', 'mid-life', 'crisis', 'scenario', 'wanting', 'more', 'turn', 'story', 'more', 'sincerely', 'depths', 'human', 'needs.Although', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'portrail', 'powerful', 'executive', 'slightly', 'off', 'fabulous', 'stund', 'middle', 'class', 'father', 'family', 'never', 'had', 'Especially', 'touching', 'how', 'character', 'overcome', 'blinding', 'ambition', 'become', 'envy', 'peers', 'sake', 'personal', 'pride', 'Nonetheless', 'movie', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'enchanting', 'Tea', 'Leoni', 'strong', 'intelligently', 'lovingly', 'scripted', 'role', 'character', 'woman', 'dreams', 'then', 'Tea', 'are', 'man', '30', 'who', 'never', 'been', 'married', 'fear', 'losing', 'everything', 'own', 'will', 'be', 'inspired', 'fearlessly', 'entertain', 'hopes', 'joys', 'might', 'be', 'yours.What', 'might', 'have', 'become', 'Unique', 'movies', 'positive', 'outlook', 'question', 'story', 'alternate', 'answer', 'who', 'pridefully', 'insist', 'will', 'be', 'happy', 'as', 'soon', 'accomplish', ""'something"", 'joy', 'sharing', 'one', 'family', 'life-as-it-is', 'hopes', 'dreams', 'what', 'are', 'still', 'becoming.I', 'left', 'movie', 'asking', 'What', 'have', 'become', 'where', 'am', 'going', 'what', 'really', 'important']",N/A

Well, in this story he does exist unlike George, but it was also Christmas time in this movie and it faintly reminded me of the story.Scrooged - Like Bill Murray's character in Scrooged, Jack Campbell(Cage in Family Man) is well off and somewhat bitter toward the opposite sex.  We see in both films as the story progresses or goes back in time what made them both turn so sour.  They both change for the better and realize a few things about the way they really want their lives to be.Mr. Destiny - In this movie, Jim Belushi, meets up with some one and gets an opportunity to see how his life could've turned out had he done something differently.  The plot of Family man is very similar.  Jack meets up with Don Cheadle(the black man who tries to rob the convenice store Jack goes into) and well, let's just say no one knows for sure who this criminal/angel type is, but he knows Jack and knows it is time to do something differently with his life.I liked all these movies, and I now add ""The Family Man"" to the list.  It was charming, very funny, and bittersweet.  Tea Leoni plays the wife that Jack wakes up to the next morning after meeting the criminal/angel. Jack has gone back in time to live his life had he stayed with his ex, who was Leoni.It was funny because my doctor had this song on in the background the day before I watched this on cable and she told me about the movie(I hadn't seen it yet), and it's the song that Cage sings to his wife at her birthday party. I'm not sure who sings it or the name but there is a line where he goes..""Sha la la la la la I love you.""  He actually had a decent voice and seemed so sincerely in love with her.

The &#65533;alternate life&#65533; plotline, which probably originated with Dickens&#65533; &#65533;A Christmas Carol&#65533; and saw its film zenith with Frank Capra&#65533;s &#65533;It&#65533;s a Wonderful Life&#65533; has seen a lot of action lately.  Films that come to mind are &#65533;Mr. Destiny&#65533;, &#65533;Sliding Doors&#65533;, and &#65533;Me, Myself, I&#65533;.  &#65533;The Family Man&#65533; is by far the most shamelessly schmaltzy and borrows something from all its predecessors.  It brazenly ... elements from &#65533;It&#65533;s a Wonderful Life&#65533; with a Christmas Eve opening where our despondent hero Jack (Nicolas Cage) tries to do a good turn for a scruffy stranger named Cash (Don Cheadle) who, as it turns out, has magical powers.  Next thing Jack knows he is in a new life where none of his former friends know who he is and his ex-girlfriend is his wife with two adorable kids.  The writers even have Cash give Jack a bell, reminiscent of ringing a bell so angels can get their wings in IAWL.  Then Jack metamorphoses from Mr. Potter to George Bailey right before our eyes.I could fill the page with derivative elements, but you get the idea.  While the story is cute at times, it defies logic that any sane person would act the way some of the characters behave in the situations given.  The story obviously panders to the masses, ennobling the middle class and vilifying the ambitious and successful.  The clear message is that if you work hard and achieve success you will live an empty life and have no appreciation of the joys that come from abandoning your aspirations and cheerfully accepting life&#65533;s indignities.  Okay, that&#65533;s a bit cynical, and lionizing the average Joe to sell tickets is nothing new, but this is a bit much.  And the ending borders on goofy.Nicholas Cage is an excellent actor but he is just too deadpan in this role.  Director Brett Ratner can&#65533;t seem to cajole any dynamism out of Cage except in the boardroom scene early in the film.  Tea Leoni gives a vivacious and lovable performance and single-handedly holds the film together from the fringes.  Don Cheadle once again steals the show with a dynamite rendering of Cash.I rated this film a 6/10.  It is a feel good film that that is easy to like, but that takes shortcuts to make a buck.

What would happen if you had changed one thing in your life?Hollywood has long been the king of formula pictures. This is no exception. The problem is this subject has been done so much better on previous occasions.Nicholas Cage plays a mega-rich Wall Street shark. He intervenes in a &quot;robbery&quot; and is catapulted into a different image of his life had he not decided to stay in England when he was younger. From this point on, the movie rides back and forth in a nonsensical journey that ends with a totally unbelievable climax.Wanting to get caught up, I tried to suspend belief. However, the changes in the main character are so contrived it makes it hard to see this as a realistic story. ONe moment he's his jerk self, then a good person, then a jerk, etc., ad nauseum. Just before the end of the movie, he finally changes for real.The dialog is horrible in spots. NO real person would ever say things in this manner. The situations are largely contrived, and the requisite Hollywood setup to make them unbelievable is, astonishingly, missing.The ending is a heart tugger, but is absolutely unrealistic. Back in the &quot;real world&quot; he pulls off a coop that has to be seen to be believed.Nicolas Cage is more wooden in this film than normal. Don Cheadle is absolutely wonderful, but unbelievable. And, Teo Leoni is the shining moment, but only in the &quot;glimpse&quot; (you'll understand if you see it).One more thing. Some of the cinematographic devices in this film are absolutely annoying. When you can pick up on color being used to change emotions, it is intruding into the film.Okay, I lied, one more: The transfer to DVD is horrbile in spots.

The dramatic tension postures Jack Campbell with a girlfriend thirteen year eariler whom in his dream marries.  Every day life in suburan America requires Campbell to change diapers, transport school age children, bowl with the company league, and work at a tire dealership.  Simple pleasures in life make the movie harm warming, such as, Jack's anniversery amensia, his new green suite, and snow fight with his children.  Dreams can only remain a dream with Jack.

Jack manages hitch up with his form boss, pitch him, and return back into big money and the luxories associated with money, such as, expensive dinners at well known restraunts, gorgeously decorated penthouse with fine furnature and art, elborate apparel and clothing, and respect drawn by fear.  Life is too perfect and Jack must return to reality which he doesn't want, after discovering the love of a family.  The magic is over.  This version of Scrouge was so much more than the critics conceded to and deserves more recognition as a great family film.

Nicolas Cage, Francis Ford Coppola's nephew, is a great actor; and I like the fact that I didn't even know he was a Coppola until years after I'd seen him for the first time in &#34;Raising Arizona&#34;. I've been a Cage fan ever since. He is a typical &#34;white bread&#34; actor with fantastic skills who goes from the highest to the lowest in his roles with that kind of flexibility, and I've only seen him in a couple of roles I didn't like. Besides that, Don Cheadle and Tea Leoni were perfect assistants to his lead role and Cage carried the story well. I got it, but I cringe with the racial stereotypes in it -- from Cheadle to the night security guard who was so subservient and molly-coddling instead of getting his &#34;$4000 and a $400 bottle of Irish Scotch,&#34; or whatever.

Lamanna,"[2, 2]","There are two kinds of people in the world:  those who love dogs and those who don't.That's the only way to make sense out of why there exists folks who do not absolutely love this movie.  I have a Masters in Communications - Cinema (shameless plug, sorry), and this is said only for perspective on my forthcoming comments.You see, you don't need another review describing the storyline or the incredible performances turned in my Mr. Cage and the other perfectly cast players (Tea Leoni is stunning; Jeremy Piven is a hoot).What is needed is a statement of why there exists in the world people who may not like this film.  And it's for the same reasons they would not like ""It's A Wonderful Life"" and ""A Christmas Story"" and any other film that requires being vulnerable and honestly admit that deep down you are broken, hurting, and are truly not in control of your universe and you're (maybe) made at God about it.The honest folks (i.e., the ""dog lovers"") simply get it.  The other ones (""non-dog lovers"") have to survive by never getting in touch with deep emotion and pain inside and will, tragically, never experience what is truly important and purposeful and genuine in life.This is not an indictment of these folks.  Just an observation.Artistically and technically, this is one of the most flawlessly executed films I know of.  It rates with director Martin Brest's 1988 ""Midnight Run"" in terms of obtaining the delicate balance of laughter and tears, outlandish scenario made believable, characters so lovable because of their vulnerability in admitting they are messed up and need help, etc ...  (the casting of De Niro opposite Grodin in 'Run' is a masterstroke, and, with the talented hand of director Brest, both completely understand their characters ""makeup"" and interaction).The same can be said of Cage in 'The Family Man.'  It's difficult to think of anyone else being able to capture so peculiarly a dispositioned dude who is caught in a dichotomy of realities.  (And few others besides Cage have the sensibilities to capture the peculiar character traits needed to star next to Shirley MacLaine in 'Guarding Tess.')  Director Brett Ratner exhibits the same understanding of story and character in his handling of this delicate setup.  In fact, Ratner's complete understanding of this material is evidenced by his statement (in accompanying interview) that he would accept no one other than Cage to play this role.He was right.'The Family Man,' like all of the aforementioned films, is timeless, classic, masterful work because it is honest enough to deal (cushioned with humor) with the pain that is so deep within all of us, and do so with finely-honed technique.Dog lovers--UNITE!",5,"""It's A Wonderful Life!""

Well written, well directed, and very well acted, it takes a potentially schmaltzy premise and makes a very enjoyable film out of it.  Although the DVD box has the reviewer quote ""Hilarious"" on the front, for the most part this is an amusing and sentimental film, rather than a knee-slapper.  Once you accept the fantasy premise, most of the film rings true.  Sure, if the road not taken involves being married to Tea Leoni, the deck is stacked a bit.  But I really bought into the emotional truth at the core of this film.  My only quibble [SPOILER ALERT] concerns the ending.  Once Jack has come to love his suburban Jersey life and then is jerked back into his investment banker life, his actions don't really seem convincing.  After he tracks Kate down to her townhouse as she packs to leave for Paris, would he really turn away and leave without a greater effort to connect with her?  And having gone to the airport to make one last attempt to convince her to stay, would he once again nearly turn away after making only another feeble effort?  Seems inconsistent with his hard-driving nature and with the epiphany he had experienced in his Jersey life.  The brief scene that immediately precedes these scenes in which he tells his investment banker colleagues that he buys into his NYC life isn't enough to justify the feebleness of his subsequent efforts to win back Kate.  Clearly, these final scenes were meant to increase the drama of the eventual reconnection, but alone in the film they don't ring true to me.Finally, there is a little bit of a glitch in the film.  [Continued spoiler alert]  At one point, Jack finds out that he and Kate moved from Greenwich Village to Jersey only after Kate became pregnant.  Their oldest child is at most five (more likely four), and 13 years have past between 1987, when Jack left for London, and 2000, when the movie is set. So that means they lived in Greenwich Village pursuing their Manhattan careers for at least seven years before settling in Jersey - unless, implausibly, Jack began working at Big Ed's early on and was commuting back and forth every day from Manhattan to Jersey.  A long enough time, you would think, for Jack to have made progress in the world of Manhattan finance, even without benefit of the London internship, and for Kate to have continued on her actual (non-pro bono lawyer) career path.  Presumably, the filmmakers needed a significant span of time to make Jack's rise to the top of the investment banking world plausible and to match Nicholas Cage's age (although Tea Leoni could easily have passed for being in her late 20s), and making their kids older would have made them less cute.  Unfortunately, though, the chronology doesn't quite add up.

Nicholas Cage (Jack), a man with a career and no other life is taken on a ride to the other side to get 'just a glimpse' of what life he could have had with Tea Leoni (Kate).Jack and Kate Campbell are the envy of everyone they know.  Jack has to learn to like his environment, he left this girl standing at the airport 13 years before, well, things are different when he wakes up in a house (not his penthouse) on Christmas morning.From the children he has to their friends, Jack really has a life, less challenging in someways in much more rewarding than the multi-million dollar man that he is in NYC.He goes from being the selfish man that he is to a renewed man who cares for others.  Apparently that is what he was all along, he just needed to see it.Throughout the movie he continually is pulled between the life he left behind and the life that is just a glimpse.  You are wondering throughout whether he will choose this family life or choose to go back to his former self.Cage does a wonderful job, is very believable and so is the whole cast.  He really has some great friends and is loved by everyone in his family role.  You are lead to wonder what the producer is trying to tell you.  There are lessons throughout this great film, quite a few laughs and more frustrations.The irony is intense.

583037,A189COFU9UUX2L,B00005JCCC,Joseph M. Patane,"[0, 0]","This is the kind of story I want to see not just at Christmas time, but anytime throught the year when I need to be reminded in my own life of what is and is not important. Though you, my reader, probably have seen this on TV and are wondering whether or not to buy this for your own library, I say to you - do so. It is well worth it and you will not regret owning this movie.Nicholas Cage (Jack Cambell) is a complete success story. He has everything he needs or wants, so he thinks. He meets what I will call a 'dark angel' who is about to change Jack's life forever. Jack steps up and prevents an incident that appears to be headed to having someone being injured or killed. He uses his own money to buy off the threat, though the sum would not even be pocket change for someone like Jack. Then he makes the mistake of trying to encourage the 'dark angel' to seek out help. This causes the 'dark angel' to pause and ask Jack if he has all he needs. Jack of course is certain he does. Not so to the 'dark angel' who sets him on a path he had at one time walked away from 13 years earlier.The story gets good from here on. Jack wakes up in bed with Kate, his wife, the woman he left 13 years ago at the airport. (He kisses her goodbye as he leaves for London. They are engaged, but for a short duration, so he tells her, he wants to expand his career potential with stocks and marketing economics. She says goodbye with tears, for she understood what might happen all too well.) Now he finds he is married to her and they have 2 children. Furthermore, to make matters worse in his eyes, he is the top salesman at a tire distriubtor company. There are hilarious moments from this moment on.He has to change Josh. Which he views as if the baby is a nuclear waste site. His daughter asks him if he is an alien and is her real father on the mother ship. He agrees with this statement, saying he is probably fine. They begin to form a bond that grows into some powerful moments from then on.The new Jack is now a family man, with inlaws, with friends he most likely would never had made otherwise, with a situation abhorent to his whole view of life. Though it is a struggle, he grows into this new life, trying at one point to get back his &#34;real life&#34; when he meets the boss he had been working for when the switch occurred by the 'dark angel'. Kate is not happy about them moving to New York because she is happy with the home she has, the simple life she has. Nothing glamerous - she is a pro-bono lawyer, which means she makes minimal salary because she helps simple people with their simple problems.Kate tells him that though she is unhappy with his plans to work for the New York firm, she will take the family and move for him. She tells him if that makes him happy, then she will make do because it is important to her that he finds what he needs in his professional life too. She states - &#34;I will do this for you, because I believe in us&#34;.This is the central theme of this movie. People mold their lives, even to do things they do not want to do, because they believe in and feel the need to make their spouse happy, fulfilled, complete. &#34;I believe in you&#34;. It is not easy to do this, it is what often divides people, separates them forever, because they cannot, will not compromise or adapt to situations that make the other person happy. The key is both have to give in to the other, both have to step back and settle for partial desires for the good of the other person, or it just does not work well, never does.Jack has adapted to his new life very well. To the point he becomes a father, a true father. Then he meets the 'dark angel' once again. He understands what this means and this tears him apart inside. He tells the 'dark angel' is it not fair to go back and forth like this, into one life, out the other. The angel reminds him it is a &#34;glimpse&#34; that he gave him, nothing more.When he goes home to say goodbye to his children it is one of the saddist moments of any movie I have ever seen and tears always fall quietly at this point. He goes into their bedrooms and touches them, kisses them goodbye. I cannot watch this without feeling the intense sorrow he must feel, for I am a father too. It is a heart rendering scene. He then says goodbye to Kate, asking her not to forget him. He asks her to say this twice. She does though she does not understand why. I know why. He wants to plant the idea in her mind of them getting back together, if there is a chance of this occurring.He returns to his time line. He is not the same Jack Cambell, the person who has it all. He is someone else now. He contacts Kate, who is a successful lawyer in her own right. She is in the process of moving to Paris, France. He goes to the airport and he tries to convince her to just sit with him and have a cup of coffee. She does not want this now. He then tells her of the possible life they had/could have. He tells her of their two children, of the simpler, happier lives they live/lived. He says to her: &#34;I have seen us together and I believe in us, Kate&#34;. Then she finally agrees to have that cup of coffee. It is a touching scene once again. They sit and talk and it starts to snow, just as it did when Jack was saying goodbye to his family, just as it did when this new life of his began - the glimpse given to him by the 'dark angel'.One gets the feeling it is a matter of time now and the &#34;father&#34; and &#34;mother&#34; begin a new, happier, fulfilled life for them both.",5,An excellent movie to have in one's library,1400457600,"05 19, 2014",2014,5532,"['kind', 'story', 'want', 'see', 'not', 'just', 'Christmas', 'time', 'anytime', 'throught', 'year', 'when', 'need', 'be', 'reminded', 'own', 'life', 'what', 'not', 'important', 'reader', 'probably', 'have', 'seen', 'TV', 'are', 'wondering', 'not', 'buy', 'own', 'library', 'say', 'do', 'so', 'well', 'worth', 'will', 'not', 'regret', 'owning', 'movie.Nicholas', 'Cage', 'Jack', 'Cambell', 'complete', 'success', 'story', 'everything', 'what', 'will', 'call', ""'dark"", 'angel', 'who', 'change', 'Jack', 'life', 'forever', 'Jack', 'up', 'prevents', 'incident', 'be', 'headed', 'having', 'someone', 'being', 'injured', 'killed', 'own', 'money', 'buy', 'off', 'threat', 'sum', 'would', 'not', 'even', 'be', 'pocket', 'change', 'someone', 'Jack', 'Then', 'mistake', 'trying', 'encourage', ""'dark"", 'angel', 'seek', 'out', 'help', ""'dark"", 'angel', 'pause', 'ask', 'Jack', 'all', 'Jack', 'course', 'certain', 'Not', 'so', ""'dark"", 'angel', 'who', 'path', 'had', 'one', 'time', 'walked', 'away', '13', 'years', 'earlier.The', 'story', 'good', 'here', 'Jack', 'up', 'bed', 'Kate', 'wife', 'woman', 'left', '13', 'years', 'ago', 'airport', 'goodbye', 'London', 'are', 'engaged', 'short', 'duration', 'expand', 'career', 'potential', 'stocks', 'marketing', 'economics', 'goodbye', 'tears', 'understood', 'what', 'might', 'happen', 'too', 'well', 'Now', 'married', 'have', '2', 'children', 'Furthermore', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'eyes', 'top', 'salesman', 'tire', 'distriubtor', 'company', 'are', 'hilarious', 'moments', 'moment', 'on.He', 'change', 'Josh', 'Which', 'baby', 'nuclear', 'waste', 'site', 'daughter', 'alien', 'real', 'father', 'mother', 'ship', 'statement', 'saying', 'probably', 'fine', 'begin', 'form', 'bond', 'powerful', 'moments', 'then', 'on.The', 'new', 'Jack', 'now', 'family', 'man', 'inlaws', 'friends', 'most', 'likely', 'would', 'never', 'had', 'made', 'otherwise', 'situation', 'abhorent', 'whole', 'view', 'life', 'struggle', 'new', 'life', 'trying', 'one', 'point', 'get', 'back', '34', 'real', 'life', '34', 'when', 'boss', 'had', 'been', 'working', 'when', 'switch', 'occurred', ""'dark"", 'angel', 'Kate', 'not', 'happy', 'moving', 'New', 'York', 'happy', 'home', 'simple', 'life', 'Nothing', 'glamerous', 'pro-bono', 'lawyer', 'minimal', 'salary', 'simple', 'people', 'simple', 'problems.Kate', 'tells', 'unhappy', 'plans', 'work', 'New', 'York', 'firm', 'will', 'take', 'family', 'move', 'happy', 'then', 'will', 'make', 'do', 'important', 'what', 'professional', 'life', 'too', '34', 'will', 'do', 'believe', '34', '.This', 'central', 'theme', 'movie', 'People', 'mold', 'lives', 'even', 'do', 'things', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'do', 'believe', 'feel', 'need', 'make', 'spouse', 'happy', 'fulfilled', 'complete', '34', 'believe', '34', 'not', 'easy', 'do', 'what', 'often', 'people', 'forever', 'can', 'not', 'will', 'not', 'compromise', 'adapt', 'situations', 'make', 'other', 'person', 'happy', 'key', 'have', 'give', 'other', 'have', 'step', 'back', 'settle', 'partial', 'desires', 'good', 'other', 'person', 'just', 'not', 'work', 'well', 'never', 'does.Jack', 'adapted', 'new', 'life', 'very', 'well', 'point', 'father', 'true', 'father', 'Then', ""'dark"", 'angel', 'once', 'again', 'what', 'apart', 'inside', ""'dark"", 'angel', 'not', 'fair', 'go', 'back', 'forth', 'one', 'life', 'other', 'angel', '34', 'glimpse', '34', 'gave', 'nothing', 'more.When', 'home', 'say', 'goodbye', 'children', 'one', 'saddist', 'moments', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'tears', 'always', 'fall', 'quietly', 'point', 'bedrooms', 'touches', 'goodbye', 'can', 'not', 'watch', 'feeling', 'intense', 'sorrow', 'must', 'feel', 'am', 'father', 'too', 'heart', 'rendering', 'scene', 'then', 'goodbye', 'Kate', 'asking', 'not', 'forget', 'say', 'twice', 'not', 'understand', 'why', 'know', 'why', 'plant', 'idea', 'mind', 'getting', 'back', 'together', 'chance', 'occurring.He', 'returns', 'time', 'line', 'not', 'same', 'Jack', 'Cambell', 'person', 'who', 'someone', 'else', 'now', 'Kate', 'who', 'successful', 'lawyer', 'own', 'right', 'process', 'moving', 'Paris', 'France', 'airport', 'convince', 'just', 'sit', 'have', 'cup', 'coffee', 'not', 'want', 'now', 'then', 'possible', 'life', 'had/could', 'have', 'two', 'children', 'simpler', 'happier', 'live/lived', '34', 'have', 'seen', 'together', 'believe', 'Kate', '34', 'Then', 'finally', 'have', 'cup', 'coffee', 'touching', 'scene', 'once', 'again', 'sit', 'talk', 'snow', 'just', 'did', 'when', 'Jack', 'was', 'saying', 'goodbye', 'family', 'just', 'did', 'when', 'new', 'life', 'began', 'glimpse', 'given', ""'dark"", ""angel'.One"", 'feeling', 'matter', 'time', 'now', '34', 'father', '34', '34', '34', 'begin', 'new', 'happier', 'fulfilled', 'life']",N/A

Nicholas Cage has the courage to take on roles that don't seem suited to him and then make them work for him. This time around, he's an ambitious executive, so committed that he works straight through Christmas (and expects his employees to do the same). Then, in a sudden twist of fate, he gets a chance to see what his life would be like if he'd married his college sweetheart. I didn't expect to like this one, not particularly impressed by either the promos or word of mouth.  But I found this one suprisingly believable with plenty of action and a nice chemistry between Cage and Tea Leoni. There's plenty of humor, too and even the child actors do a great job in their roles. Cage is great as the exec who has a hard time accepting a lower class life than the one he'd had, not to mention the additional responsibilities of being a husband and father, not exactly something you can learn overnight.

With this story, there is absolutely no middle ground. By going to the extremes, the director makes this almost a castration of the powerful cut throat corporate tycoon and knocks him down a few pegs. Yes, Jack is a self serving, spiritually empty jerk that is having so much fun doing so, he forgets about what its like to have a moral center where the lure of love isnt just a pick up line to get a woman into bed. With that being said, Jack is VERY talented at pursuading people and is a born salesmen who is meant for a better life than working at the inlaws car dealership. But, his entire parallel life revolves around his wife and the kids with NOTHING in it for him, except just coexisting with his college sweetheart in the burbs. Yeah, his real life outside of the office is a bit empty, but he loves every minute of it... until he is shown a Grass is Greener/ diverging roads life where Jack actually had chosen his sweetheart over the promising career. And while living his parallel life, he has an unexpected run in with his former boss and like any man, Jack ascertains that he could possibly have the best of both worlds, family AND career, RIGHT?  WRONG! The wife basically lets him now that he needs to give up any dreams of success and just be satisfied with his current mundane existence with her & the kids.  Who cares if he hates being a tire salesman for the inlaws dealership, knowing (because he lived it) that he was meant for great things... just so long as we're TOGETHER.  That's ALL that REALLY matters.  While that may work in some rose colored, silver screened, fantasy world, it's not realistic.  Now, almost ANY normal man that has an ounce of testosterone in his body and some self respect, given a choice would choose the former high power life of money, fast cars and being with drop dead gorgeous women. And if given a choice, do we really belive that women would choose to be with Mr. Mom over Indiana Jones?  If I didnt know better, I would have sworn this movie was written by an anti capitalist man hating woman. Nope, just Brett Ratner.

583053,A2HB1S7PRHW4JL,B00005JCCC,Kyle Slater,"[3, 3]","Another surprising movie that I found easier to watch than expected.  It seems every year around Christmastime a writer will borrow the same storyline for It's A Wonderful Life, and make a movie that is a horrific copy.  While borrowing the premise, the film definately breathes a life of its own.  The end result is a warm Christmas movie, more for adults than for the kids.Nick Cage sheds the Ferraris early and is thrust into middle-class hell, surounded by a wife, kids, and a dog.  How would you feel if you models used to fawn over you and you'd put together billion-dollar business mergers, suddenly to find that your one hobby was bowling (not to knock the bowlers out there).Tea Leoni actually proves that she can act.  This is a far cry from her short-lived TV series.  She and Cage together do make quite a pair.My only complaint about this film is the driving force behind the theory that every person will be happier and have a more fulfilling life if they are married with a family.  What is wrong with being older, successful, and happy with still being a bachelor?  Do you have to have a band of gold (or platinum, if that's your choice!) around your finger to achieve a good night's sleep?Oh yeah, one of the brightest spots in the film was Don Cheadle (one of my favorite actors).

583054,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JCCC,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[8, 9]","The idea of lesson of the road not taken has been done to death in Hollywood and never as well as when Frank Capra but Jimmy Stewart's George Bailey through the wringer of seeing what the world would have been like if he had never been born in ""It's a Wonderful Life.""  So when somebody like Jack Campbell (Nicholas Cage) wakes up on Christmas morning and discovers that instead of being a Wall Street playboy he wakes up in a bedroom in a New Jersey home with a wife and two kids he might think that he has descended into Hell, but of course it is no where as bad as Bedford Falls turned into Pottersville.  Still, there is something potent about the idea of intervention, divine or otherwise, that intervenes in some mystical way to make sure we are on the right path.""The Family Man"" is totally predictable in terms of having the requisite scenes for this type of tale.  We begin with the ""wrong choice,"" which happened thirteen years earlier at the airport when Jack got on a plane to start his career on the way to being a major domo of mergers and acquisitions and left behind his college sweetheart, Kate Reynold (T&eacute;a Leoni), despite the fact that she pleads with him not to go.  Now play is playing Scrooge on Christmas Eve to clinch a big deal and two things happen to derail his plans and give him a glimpse of an alternative life.  First, he gets a message to call Kate.  Second, he acts to save his life during what appears to be a robbery.  The next thing he knows a strange man (Don Cheadle) is making the point that Jack has no one to blame for himself for what is about to happen.  The next morning Jack wakes up in bed with Kate and two kids come bursting through the door all excited about it being Christmas.  Jack proceeds to freak.Again, we know what is going to happen.  There will be scenes where Jack has to function in his ""new"" life while everybody wonders why he is acting so strangely.  There will be the effort to get his old life back, the moment where he accepts his new reality, and the moment when it is taken away.  Despite this predictability the film is still worth seeing and an above average example of the well worn genre.  The reasons would be as follows:First, there is T&eacute;a Leoni, who is as comfortable in her role of Kate as Kate is in her life.  There is a scene where Jack finally realizes what we have known from the start, that Kate is a beautiful woman, and she says in wonder, ""How can you...Look at me like you haven't seen me every day for the last 13 years?""  Nicholas Cage is certainly good in this film and his performance keeps this one from becoming sappy, but his best moments are playing off of Leoni.Second, I liked the fact that Jack's daughter, young Annie (Makenzie Vega), figures out pretty quickly that the guy struggling to change baby Josh's diapers is not her father.  She has her own hypothesis as to what is going on that involves aliens and a mothership, but this allows Jack to receive some help on where to go and what to do to at least pretend that he knows what he is doing.  Besides, the relationship between Jack and Annie sets up one of the nicest moments in the film.Third, I like the way the script by David Diamond & David Weissman proves that Jack is good at his Wall Street job (there is a nice deleted scene where he takes those skills to his new job as the best tire salesman in the Garden State).  A lot of times in movies like this we are told about a character's abilities rather than being shown.  This film took the time to show Jack's strengths.Fourth, I like the way the movie played out the scene where Jack realizes that he is going to lose the life of being a family man that he has finally embraced.  The question at that point, when you have accepted that it is all going to slip away, is ""What do you do?""  I like the answer the script comes up with and the way Cage plays it.Finally, I actually liked the way this one played out its end game, not in terms of the bookend effect but specifically in terms of where Jack is in the final scene.  Maybe I have seen this type of resolution before (it is hard to believe with how many of these there have been that this road has not been trod before as well), but it struck me as being different and certainly made me rethink the particular lesson on the film.  This might be one of the more pragmatic endings I have seen in this genre.Certainly you have to be in the requisite mood to watch a film of this type, especially if you are concerned about saccharin levels in your cinematic intake.  I obviously put this one off for several years.  But the bottom line is that unless you are morally offended by the basic plot line of this 2000 film and its movie brethren, you should find it enjoyable.",4,Lucky Nicholas Cage wakes up married to T&eacute;a Leoni,1098403200,"10 22, 2004",2004,4752,"['idea', 'lesson', 'road', 'not', 'taken', 'been', 'done', 'death', 'Hollywood', 'never', 'as', 'well', 'when', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'George', 'Bailey', 'wringer', 'seeing', 'what', 'world', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'born', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'when', 'somebody', 'Jack', 'Campbell', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'up', 'Christmas', 'morning', 'discovers', 'instead', 'being', 'Wall', 'Street', 'up', 'bedroom', 'New', 'Jersey', 'home', 'wife', 'two', 'kids', 'might', 'think', 'descended', 'Hell', 'course', 'where', 'as', 'bad', 'Bedford', 'Falls', 'turned', 'Pottersville', 'Still', 'something', 'potent', 'idea', 'intervention', 'divine', 'otherwise', 'intervenes', 'mystical', 'way', 'make', 'sure', 'are', 'right', 'path', 'Family', 'Man', 'totally', 'predictable', 'terms', 'having', 'requisite', 'scenes', 'type', 'tale', 'begin', 'wrong', 'choice', 'happened', 'thirteen', 'years', 'earlier', 'airport', 'when', 'Jack', 'got', 'plane', 'start', 'career', 'way', 'being', 'major', 'domo', 'mergers', 'acquisitions', 'left', 'college', 'sweetheart', 'Kate', 'Reynold', 'T', 'eacute', 'Leoni', 'fact', 'not', 'go', 'Now', 'play', 'playing', 'Scrooge', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'clinch', 'big', 'deal', 'two', 'things', 'happen', 'derail', 'plans', 'give', 'glimpse', 'alternative', 'life', 'First', 'message', 'call', 'Kate', 'Second', 'save', 'life', 'what', 'be', 'robbery', 'next', 'thing', 'strange', 'man', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'making', 'point', 'Jack', 'one', 'blame', 'what', 'about', 'happen', 'next', 'morning', 'Jack', 'up', 'bed', 'Kate', 'two', 'kids', 'come', 'bursting', 'door', 'excited', 'being', 'Christmas', 'Jack', 'freak.Again', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'will', 'be', 'scenes', 'where', 'Jack', 'function', 'new', 'life', 'everybody', 'wonders', 'why', 'acting', 'so', 'strangely', 'will', 'be', 'effort', 'get', 'old', 'life', 'back', 'moment', 'where', 'new', 'reality', 'moment', 'when', 'taken', 'away', 'predictability', 'film', 'still', 'worth', 'seeing', 'above', 'average', 'example', 'well', 'worn', 'genre', 'reasons', 'would', 'be', 'First', 'T', 'eacute', 'Leoni', 'who', 'comfortable', 'role', 'Kate', 'Kate', 'life', 'scene', 'where', 'Jack', 'finally', 'what', 'have', 'known', 'start', 'Kate', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'wonder', 'How', 'can', 'Look', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'day', 'last', '13', 'years', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'certainly', 'good', 'film', 'performance', 'one', 'becoming', 'sappy', 'best', 'moments', 'are', 'playing', 'Leoni.Second', 'liked', 'fact', 'Jack', 'daughter', 'young', 'Annie', 'Makenzie', 'Vega', 'out', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'guy', 'struggling', 'change', 'baby', 'Josh', 'diapers', 'not', 'father', 'own', 'hypothesis', 'what', 'going', 'aliens', 'mothership', 'Jack', 'receive', 'help', 'where', 'go', 'what', 'do', 'least', 'pretend', 'what', 'doing', 'Besides', 'relationship', 'Jack', 'Annie', 'up', 'one', 'nicest', 'moments', 'film.Third', 'like', 'way', 'script', 'David', 'Diamond', 'David', 'Weissman', 'Jack', 'good', 'Wall', 'Street', 'job', 'nice', 'deleted', 'scene', 'where', 'skills', 'new', 'job', 'best', 'tire', 'salesman', 'Garden', 'State', 'lot', 'times', 'movies', 'are', 'told', 'character', 'abilities', 'rather', 'being', 'shown', 'film', 'took', 'time', 'show', 'Jack', 'strengths.Fourth', 'like', 'way', 'movie', 'played', 'out', 'scene', 'where', 'Jack', 'going', 'lose', 'life', 'being', 'family', 'man', 'finally', 'embraced', 'question', 'point', 'when', 'have', 'accepted', 'going', 'slip', 'away', 'What', 'do', 'do', 'like', 'answer', 'script', 'up', 'way', 'Cage', 'it.Finally', 'actually', 'liked', 'way', 'one', 'played', 'out', 'end', 'game', 'not', 'terms', 'bookend', 'effect', 'specifically', 'terms', 'where', 'Jack', 'final', 'scene', 'Maybe', 'have', 'seen', 'type', 'resolution', 'hard', 'believe', 'how', 'many', 'have', 'been', 'road', 'not', 'been', 'trod', 'before', 'as', 'well', 'struck', 'being', 'different', 'certainly', 'made', 'rethink', 'particular', 'lesson', 'film', 'might', 'be', 'one', 'more', 'pragmatic', 'endings', 'have', 'seen', 'genre.Certainly', 'have', 'be', 'requisite', 'mood', 'watch', 'film', 'type', 'especially', 'are', 'concerned', 'saccharin', 'levels', 'cinematic', 'intake', 'obviously', 'put', 'one', 'off', 'several', 'years', 'bottom', 'line', 'are', 'morally', 'offended', 'basic', 'plot', 'line', '2000', 'film', 'movie', 'brethren', 'should', 'find', 'enjoyable']",N/A

Obviously contrived plot, ludicrous dialog, over the top direction, and just a bad movie. It's like so many other lame chick flicks that you've seen, that give chick flicks a bad reputation and ruin the box office for good chick flicks (like ""You've Got Mail"" or ""The Time Traveler's Wife"").I probably can't add much over the wrath already poured out by the other reviewers, but I can add this odd insight. Somehow the title of this movie and the banal DVD spine (plain white with the title in blue and Cage's picture) seem to attract chicks. I have an entire book shelf of DVDs and when chicks look them over, they always pick this one out. It's so odd. I have other chick flicks on the shelf, and I have other Nicolas Cage movies, but they consistently pick this one out. I also get many chicks that pick the movie out and then tell me how much they love it (just like the many reviewers here that rate this movie highly, even rating it a 10!!!). I have watched the movie twice (first by choice, then by force), and I refuse to watch it ever again. So, I just punched up my DVD database and changed the DVD number for this one (I have all my DVDs numbered) so that the DVD will sit on the back of my bookshelf out of plain site.

One night (Christmas Eve) he's in a convenience store when he meets the man that will change his life.

Thirteen years earlier Kate (Leoni) begged Jack (Cage) to get off the plane bound for London. Jack took ""the road less traveled"" and ended up a Wall Street trader living out Playboy fantasies in his Manhattan penthouse. On Christmas Eve a street smart angel gives Jack a glimpse of what might have been had he gotten off the plane and married Kate. Jack freaks out at his suburban life of domestication complete with bowling buddies, working at his father-in-laws tire store, and Kate employed as a non-profit lawyer with two young children and a dog to boot. New York lights attract Jack until he gives the glimpse a chance and falls in love with life as a family man. One thing becomes clear to him ... that Kate was the love of his life and how he let her go by not choosing ""us"" left him rich in luxury and poor in love. When Jack runs into the angel he almost demands to stay where he is... but a glimpse is a glimpse and he wakes up in his Wall Street life. Jack's only salvation is to find Kate, now a big-time corporate attorney, before she moves to Paris and demands she get off the plane to have coffee with him.A sweet endearing promise of our loves lost and found and lost and found.

We love it now. In fact, this film has been added to our collection of Christmas films that we watch every year, along with ""Love Actually,"" ""Die Hard,"" ""The Holiday,"" ""Trading Places,"" ""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation,"" ""A Christmas Carol,"" ""Home Alone,"" ""The Stepmom,"" and ""Little Women."" (The list is growing).Of course ""It's a Wonderful Life"" was a touchstone for this film. And, like its predecessor, this film is sure to grow in popularity over the years. Nearly every frame in this film is a gift. Nicholas Cage and T&eacute;o Leoni are at their best. The child actors are adorable. Yes, it is a feel-good movie. So what? Isn't that why we watch movies like this, especially around the holidays? Part of the joy of watching a film is the suspension of belief. The giving over of ourselves to enjoying a certain experience.Those of us who are married and are parents can relate to many of the themes in this movie. I could be wrong, but I think a lot of the naysayers here are folks who don't have families, are not married, and regularly eschew the family lifestyle, especially if it involves the suburbs. Oddly enough, many critics of the suburbs are themselves the products of the suburbs, and seem to have knee-jerk reactions to anything that even slightly appears to show a positive side to life away from the city. They seem to be projecting a lot of their own insecurities and unhappiness onto this film. In fact, I think bashing the suburbs has become an American clich&eacute;, too. It's a sign of unoriginality to dismiss the lives of millions of Americans who are raising their families in diverse places that have nothing to do with city centers.

So one morning he finds himself as a family man and.. well.. he begins to like it. Off course he is torn out of that illusion and realisez it would be great to see Kate again and live this life for real.CAST: Nicolas Cage is perfect. He manages to carry the movie and keep the ballance between comedy and tragedy. We all know he's got the sadest eyes in Hollywood but he can also be extremely funny. Tea Leoni plays a likeable Kate Reynolds. She is the perfect wife for Nicolas Cage. There's a lot of chemistry between the two of them and you don't wanna be Jack Campbell if Katie is getting angry. Don Cheadle, who was brilliant in Traffic is reduced to a chliched African American who goves Jack the glimps of the what if world.WRITING/DIRECTING: This could have been such a sappy romantic movie but it actualy touched me on several levels and warmed my heart. The combination of comedy (which sometimes is a bit too over the top) and Drama works pretty well and you begin to ask those famous questions to yourself. What if, what if.. Brett Rattner.. well, I couldn't believe that after two mediocre buddy movies (Rush Hour and Money talks) he'd be able to direct a serious movie. He did a great job. My favourite shot is when Cage walks his dog. Also the images have a warm feeling to them which adds to the story.THE DVD:Making of, Deleted scenes, hillarious outtakes, director/producer/writer commentaries. All you could ask for. But what makes this DVD an absolute winner is the isolated music score with commentary by Danny Elfman, who I would hire if I would ever do a Christmas movie...ALL IN ALL: I guess this movie is a little bit corny but that kind of corny that touches you and feels real. Great performances and an interesting story. The only problem are some bad jokes.. but that's all.

Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[0, 0]","""The Family Man"" is, at its core, a Romantic Comedy, but it is also a fantasy in the ""how your life might have been"" genre that includes everything from ""Sliding Doors"" to ""It's A Wonderful Life.""Nicolas Cage plays Jack Campbell, an ambitious young man who leaves fianc&eacute;e Kate Reynolds, played by Tea Leoni, in 1987 to pursue an internship in London.  Kate gives him a tearful, prescient speech at the airport about how certain she is that this means the end for them and begging him not to take the flight.The prologue gives way to thirteen years later where Jack is now President of his own firm on Wall Street and Scrooge-ish Jack gives his employees management-speak encouragement for why they are there working late Christmas Eve - and must return to work Christmas as well.  (How many blockbuster mergers and acquisitions are accomplished on Christmas?  I'm just askin'.)Jack is not only a slave-driver boss, he also makes only the most shallow attachments to any women in his life.His secretary tells him that he has a message from Kate - who he hasn't heard from since you-know-when.That night Jack interrupts a hold-up at the local convenience store, trying to cool off the stick-up man and save those threatened with a gun.  The stick-up guy is played by the always good Don Cheadle and... hey, he's not just a stick-up guy!  His exact nature is never exactly explained, but there are several obvious similarities with Clarence the Angel Third Class from ""Wonderful Life"".  For one, he gives Jack, against his wishes, a ""glimpse"" of the alternate reality life. (For another - he gives Jack a bell to summon him, reminiscent of the part of Wonderful Life where bell-ringing accompanies Angels receiving their wings.The next morning Jack wakes up - in bed beside Kate, his wife of these many years, along with their two children in their suburban home in North Jersey, where they moved from New York, because that was no place to raise a family.Since this is a fantasy, no one can say what is the correct way to respond to such a situation, but I'll go ahead and say I found Jimmy Stewart's interpretation better than Mr. Cage's.Jack is not only no longer a wealthy Wall-Street Investment guy, he now works at his father's retail tire shop.  He no longer entertains a string of beautiful women in his bedroom.  Instead he bowls with his friend Arnie (a good turn by Jeremy Piven).We know, because of the formula, that Jack is going to go through a period of disorientation, and we know that we're going to arrive at the place where Jack will regret leaving Kate back at the airport thirteen years ago.I've said before that my least favorite romantic comedy clich&eacute;s is the scene where one character goes tearing off to the airport because they made The Big Mistake and to prevent losing The Love Of Their Life, but I'll also go ahead and say that Cage and Leoni do good work in this scene with good words and good direction.",4,A More than Passable Romantic Comedic Fantasy,1240185600,"04 20, 2009",2009,2945,"['Family', 'Man', 'core', 'Romantic', 'Comedy', 'also', 'fantasy', 'how', 'life', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'genre', 'everything', 'Sliding', 'Doors', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'Jack', 'Campbell', 'ambitious', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Kate', 'Reynolds', 'played', 'Tea', 'Leoni', '1987', 'pursue', 'internship', 'London', 'Kate', 'tearful', 'prescient', 'speech', 'airport', 'how', 'certain', 'end', 'begging', 'not', 'take', 'flight.The', 'prologue', 'way', 'thirteen', 'years', 'later', 'where', 'Jack', 'now', 'President', 'own', 'firm', 'Wall', 'Street', 'Scrooge-ish', 'Jack', 'employees', 'management-speak', 'encouragement', 'why', 'are', 'there', 'working', 'late', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'must', 'return', 'work', 'Christmas', 'as', 'well', 'How', 'many', 'blockbuster', 'mergers', 'acquisitions', 'are', 'accomplished', 'Christmas', ""'m"", 'just', 'askin', 'Jack', 'not', 'only', 'slave-driver', 'boss', 'also', 'only', 'most', 'shallow', 'attachments', 'women', 'life.His', 'secretary', 'message', 'Kate', 'who', ""n't"", 'heard', 'you-know-when.That', 'night', 'Jack', 'hold-up', 'local', 'convenience', 'store', 'trying', 'cool', 'off', 'stick-up', 'man', 'save', 'threatened', 'gun', 'stick-up', 'guy', 'played', 'always', 'good', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'hey', 'not', 'just', 'stick-up', 'guy', 'exact', 'nature', 'never', 'exactly', 'explained', 'are', 'several', 'obvious', 'similarities', 'Clarence', 'Angel', 'Third', 'Class', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'one', 'Jack', 'wishes', 'glimpse', 'alternate', 'reality', 'life', 'Jack', 'bell', 'summon', 'reminiscent', 'part', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'where', 'bell-ringing', 'accompanies', 'Angels', 'receiving', 'wings.The', 'morning', 'Jack', 'up', 'bed', 'beside', 'Kate', 'wife', 'many', 'years', 'two', 'children', 'suburban', 'home', 'North', 'Jersey', 'where', 'moved', 'New', 'York', 'was', 'place', 'raise', 'family.Since', 'fantasy', 'one', 'can', 'say', 'what', 'correct', 'way', 'respond', 'situation', ""'ll"", 'go', 'ahead', 'say', 'found', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'interpretation', 'better', 'Mr.', ""Cage's.Jack"", 'not', 'only', 'no', 'longer', 'wealthy', 'Wall-Street', 'Investment', 'guy', 'now', 'father', 'retail', 'tire', 'shop', 'no', 'longer', 'string', 'beautiful', 'women', 'bedroom', 'Instead', 'friend', 'Arnie', 'good', 'turn', 'Jeremy', 'Piven', '.We', 'know', 'formula', 'Jack', 'going', 'go', 'period', 'disorientation', 'know', ""'re"", 'going', 'arrive', 'place', 'where', 'Jack', 'will', 'regret', 'leaving', 'Kate', 'back', 'airport', 'thirteen', 'years', 'ago.I', ""'ve"", 'said', 'least', 'favorite', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'clich', 'eacute', 'scene', 'where', 'one', 'character', 'tearing', 'off', 'airport', 'made', 'Big', 'Mistake', 'prevent', 'losing', 'Love', 'Their', 'Life', ""'ll"", 'also', 'go', 'ahead', 'say', 'Cage', 'Leoni', 'do', 'good', 'work', 'scene', 'good', 'words', 'good', 'direction']",N/A
583070,A51FZD3M0N4AH,B00005JCCC,"Mark Twain ""Sam""","[1, 2]","They almost had me fooled. In the beginning, and rightfully so, I thought that it was one of those feel-good flicks, where some rich and powerful man (or a woman) realizes that money is not everything in life, and as a result ends up with new family, friends, religion, wisdom, and ... EVEN MORE MONEY! And things seemed to be going exactly that way. The protagonist lost his privileges, became a family man, a regular guy, secured personal happiness, and was getting back to the old Wall Street outfit (after talking gibberish to his former boss - a stalwart of high finance, who suddenly turned up stranded in the middle of New Jersey with a flat tire in his Rolls Royce). But when that storyline fell apart, I started to believe that was dealing with something deeper and more original than a mere slice of bourgeoisie propaganda. I must admit that remained under such impression until the very end of the film, and only when the movie ended, said to myself: ""Wait a minute! The man's still got everything he had before, plus a woman of his dream, but this time she is making much more money and will not insist on him giving up a good job. Of course, they do not have those children and lost 13 years of living together, but they are still young and with any luck will have enough resources to produce offsprings and add the lost years to the end of their lives. Possibly, they could decide to move to New Jersey and live in a regular suburban house, but what would they do with all that extra cash? So, what was the lesson? Those rich guys always win!""This film is well made, by the people who know their trade, and can be wholeheartedly recommended to anyone who has nothing better to do than to watch it. I took away one star for the trivial and insincere morale, and another one for the ending. Why did they show our couple sitting together, drinking coffee? The woman already said ""OK"", and that should have been the end of it! Cage delivers his usual generic performance, and Leoni overdoes luminosity of her character, but Don Cheadle is perfect, and I wish there was more of him in the script (if I ever wanted to watch this movie again).",3,Not for every family ...,1195862400,"11 24, 2007",2007,2150,"['almost', 'had', 'fooled', 'beginning', 'rightfully', 'so', 'thought', 'was', 'one', 'feel-good', 'flicks', 'where', 'rich', 'powerful', 'man', 'woman', 'money', 'not', 'everything', 'life', 'result', 'up', 'new', 'family', 'friends', 'religion', 'wisdom', 'EVEN', 'MORE', 'MONEY', 'things', 'seemed', 'be', 'going', 'exactly', 'way', 'protagonist', 'lost', 'privileges', 'became', 'family', 'man', 'regular', 'guy', 'secured', 'personal', 'happiness', 'was', 'getting', 'back', 'old', 'Wall', 'Street', 'outfit', 'talking', 'gibberish', 'former', 'boss', 'stalwart', 'high', 'finance', 'who', 'suddenly', 'turned', 'up', 'stranded', 'middle', 'New', 'Jersey', 'flat', 'tire', 'Rolls', 'Royce', 'when', 'storyline', 'fell', 'apart', 'started', 'believe', 'was', 'dealing', 'something', 'deeper', 'more', 'original', 'mere', 'slice', 'bourgeoisie', 'propaganda', 'must', 'admit', 'remained', 'such', 'impression', 'very', 'end', 'film', 'only', 'when', 'movie', 'ended', 'said', 'myself', 'Wait', 'minute', 'man', 'still', 'got', 'everything', 'had', 'woman', 'dream', 'time', 'making', 'much', 'more', 'money', 'will', 'not', 'insist', 'giving', 'up', 'good', 'job', 'course', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'children', 'lost', '13', 'years', 'living', 'together', 'are', 'still', 'young', 'luck', 'will', 'have', 'enough', 'resources', 'produce', 'offsprings', 'add', 'lost', 'years', 'end', 'lives', 'Possibly', 'could', 'decide', 'move', 'New', 'Jersey', 'live', 'regular', 'suburban', 'house', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'extra', 'cash', 'So', 'what', 'was', 'lesson', 'rich', 'guys', 'always', 'win', 'film', 'well', 'made', 'people', 'who', 'know', 'trade', 'can', 'be', 'wholeheartedly', 'recommended', 'anyone', 'who', 'nothing', 'better', 'do', 'watch', 'took', 'away', 'one', 'star', 'trivial', 'insincere', 'morale', 'one', 'ending', 'Why', 'did', 'show', 'couple', 'sitting', 'together', 'drinking', 'coffee', 'woman', 'already', 'said', 'OK', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'end', 'Cage', 'usual', 'generic', 'performance', 'Leoni', 'overdoes', 'luminosity', 'character', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'perfect', 'wish', 'was', 'more', 'script', 'ever', 'wanted', 'watch', 'movie', 'again']",N/A
583071,A2NGF128HTRD39,B00005JCCC,Matt,"[1, 1]","Brett Ratner's comedy, The Family Man, focuses on Jack Campbell, played by Nicolas Cage.  Jack is now a wealthy Wall Street businessman who seems to have everything he ever wanted out of life.  However, we learn that thirteen years before present day, he made a huge decision that completely changed his future.  Jack was going off to London for a year, leaving behind his fiancee girlfriend.  His girlfriend, Kate (Tea Leoni) asked him to stay with her, but he left her there at the airport, and never saw or talked to her ever again.  Well, his &quot;Roadless Travel&quot; as he calls it, gets a wake-up call at a gas station when there is a hold-up having to do with a lottery ticket.  Jack makes a purposal with the man (Don Cheadle), and they agree to trade the winning ticket for two hundred dollars.  Unknowingly, the man holding up the store is an angel, and gives Jack a glimpse of what his life could've been like, had he stayed and married Kate.  The next morning, Jack wakes up with dog slobber on his face, and his wife on top of him, and his eye opening experience begins.Yes, yes- you've all heard that this film is this generation's &quot;It's A Wonderful Life&quot;, but what I like even more about this film rather than &quot;Life&quot; is its humor, the advantage this man has to this other life, and the romance formed between Cage and Leoni, rather than a horrifying alternate-reality where he learns how his life could have changed the world had he not been in existence.This film is absolutely perfect.  It has everything I want out of this genre.  It doesn't go overboard, and it doesn't take itself way too seriously, or out of line.  It creates humor, romance, suspense, and packs wonderful performances.  It captures the momentum and power of &quot;Life&quot;, and it makes this alternate life a good thing.  I loved how Cage interacted with this new world.  It was also fun to see him react to his job, his kids, his friends, and his low balanced checking account.  What also rang the bells for me was when the film decided to give Jack the chance to get the best of both worlds.  He was fit for the Wall Street job, and he could stay with his family at the same time.  Just when you think that is just perfect and what should happen, Jack and the audience still realize they aren't getting the point which I coped with as well.  Tea Leoni was magnificent!  My favorite part of the film with her and Cage together centered around the chocolate cake scene.  The shopping mall scene was fascinatingly humorous, and the way Jack turned his life around and learned how much more enjoyable his life would've been was truly a spectacle.At one point with the filmmaking process, I learned that Nicolas Cage turned this film down two or three times, just because he thought the story was very corny.  Director, Brett Ratner kept on pursuing Cage because he felt he would be perfect for the role.  According to some of the special feature interviews on the DVD, Ratner convinced Nick to do a film that doesn't come knocking on his door too often.  Cage finally OK'd it, and signed on, hoping that this film might give him a better image, as well as his hopes for this film to be successful in itself.  It sure payed off.This is Ratner's best film yet.  It is absolutely fun.  Every actor has an equal share and makes this movie excellent.  The plot is ingenious and smart.  The humor and romance excell beyond expectations.  Nicolas Cage almost seems better as a family man rather than a hard-core action hero.  There is absolutely nothing I would change with this film.  It is fall down stupendous.QUOTE: &quot;Everything works for this film.  I absolutely loved the whole thing from beginning to end!  Tea Leoni and Nicolas Cage are the perfect duo.  Brett Ratner makes his golden film right here, a film that could never be made any better.  The humor soars, the romance shines, and the fun and dramatic aspect of the entire thing never lets go.

583072,A2B6VI9MQI0WKI,B00005JCCC,Matthew Gladney,"[1, 2]","'The Family Man' tackles the tough question of what should be of top priority to a person's existence. The movie is done well, with solid directing, acting, and a wonderful score by Danny Elfman. It gets its message across by telling the story, *not* by being preachy, and manages to provide a convincing &quot;change-of-character&quot; for Jack Campbell (played by Nicholas Cage).The movie starts about ten years in the past, with Campbell saying goodbye to his girlfriend Kate (played wonderfully, and with much depth, by Tea Leoni). He is going to London to further his education/career. She does not want him to go, opting for them to simply &quot;be together&quot;. He ends up going.  Flash forward to the present, where Jack Campbell is now the second-in-command of a highly successful corporation. He and Kate are long since history, and his &quot;companionship&quot; basically exists with the &quot;woman of the hour&quot;, so to speak. He even insists that his employees work on Christmas Day. He is all about the dollar. Through a somewhat muddled plot development, he is taken from this life, and placed into another one - one where he has been married to Kate for ten years, and they live in a Jersey suburb with kids, and *not* a ton of money.I must admit to completely agreeing with the point which 'Family Man' is trying to make - that people, especially loved ones and family, are the most important things in life - not how much money you make, or what kind of car you drive, or that you live in a posh penthouse. During the months that Campbell lives this &quot;alternative life&quot;, he learns to embrace it for its warmth and love, and many of the scenes between Cage and Leoni are touching and sweet. When it is time, inevitably, for the Campbell character to return to his &quot;normal life&quot;, he of course doesn't want to go. I won't reveal how it ends, but I *will* say that it is one of the more skeptical points of the film.'The Family Man' is a very well put-together movie, and I love its underlying themes, but I can not give it five stars, due to a few plot points. The weak areas concern the scenario in which Campbell is granted his glimpse of the &quot;alternative life&quot;, the method in which he attempts to get-in at the corporation while in this &quot;alternative life&quot;, and the ending. The other problem is this: though the movie (and I) believe that in order to be truly happy you have to focus on family and friends, to love and to be loved, I know that there are *many* people out there who are *very* happy without a family, finding their passions filled with their work (career or otherwise). What's good for some isn't always good for others.So, taking everything into consideration, I can not give the film a *total* green light.

583073,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00005JCCC,Matthew Horner,"[4, 13]","The Family Man can best be described as a 'feel good' movie. It is designed to give an audience the warm fuzzies. I suppose there is nothing wrong with being made to feel fuzzy, but, in order to be put into such a state, a person needs to be sentimental. Since I very rarely feel sentimental, the movie did not work for me at all; however, I can see how it could work for a lot of people.Jack [Nicholas Cage] is a hugely successful New York stock broker. His apartment is grand, his suits are quite expensive, he drives a Ferrari, and he has his pick of women. When he was in college, he was madly in love with Kate [Tea Leoni]. When the movie opens, we see the couple at an airport. Jack is flying to London to study for a year. Kate tearfully begs him to stay, fearing his leaving will end their relationship. Naturally, it does, and we next see Jack twelve years later, still single and so driven that he is working late on Christmas Eve in order to cement a giant corporate merger. That night he comes to the aid of the seemingly homeless Cash [Don Cheadle], who turns out to be some sort of spirit guide. The next morning, Jack wakes up to find he has been transported to some sort of alternate universe. Now he is, in fact, married to Kate. They live in New Jersey and have several of those adorable, almost maintenance-free kids you see only in the movies. He's not a stock broker in this life. He sells tires for his father-in-law. Kate hasn't become the high-powered attorney she intended to be, but rather one who defends the poor. Jack spends the rest of the movie frantically trying to get his old life back. Eventually, he learns that happiness requires a loving family. Apparently, it also requires one to live in New Jersey and to sell tires.Only in Hollywood, where the people who make these movies are themselves often rich and single or divorced, could such a tale be conceived. It is aimed at ordinary people, who Hollywood assumes think ordinary is where it's at. The oddest thing about The Family Man is that Jack, other than being stuck with working on Christmas Eve, doesn't seem at all deprived. He not only thrives on his hectic life, he appears to love it. It's true that the life he discovers in that alternate universe is charming and fulfilling in an entirely different way, but we all make choices in life that prevent us from knowing what our lives might have been. Jack finds out that he's unknowingly been unhappy all these years, but only because the script says so. It's as though the people who made the movie couldn't bring themselves to scoff too much at their own lifestyles, which more closely resemble wealthy, successful Jack's.Cage, Leoni and Cheadle get through their roles effortlessly. Each is used to acting in headier stuff, and this movie is a piece of cake for them. It's also a piece of cake for us, one which will seem much too artificially sweet to some viewers.",2,Gag me with a 'feel good' spoon!,1016150400,"03 15, 2002",2002,2915,"['Family', 'Man', 'can', 'best', 'be', 'described', ""'feel"", 'good', 'movie', 'designed', 'give', 'audience', 'warm', 'fuzzies', 'suppose', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'being', 'made', 'feel', 'fuzzy', 'order', 'be', 'put', 'state', 'person', 'be', 'sentimental', 'very', 'rarely', 'feel', 'sentimental', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'work', 'however', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'could', 'work', 'lot', 'people.Jack', '[', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', ']', 'hugely', 'successful', 'New', 'York', 'stock', 'broker', 'apartment', 'grand', 'suits', 'are', 'quite', 'expensive', 'Ferrari', 'pick', 'women', 'When', 'was', 'college', 'was', 'madly', 'love', 'Kate', '[', 'Tea', 'Leoni', ']', 'When', 'movie', 'see', 'couple', 'airport', 'Jack', 'flying', 'London', 'study', 'year', 'Kate', 'tearfully', 'stay', 'fearing', 'leaving', 'will', 'end', 'relationship', 'Naturally', 'next', 'see', 'Jack', 'twelve', 'years', 'later', 'still', 'single', 'so', 'driven', 'working', 'late', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'order', 'cement', 'giant', 'corporate', 'merger', 'night', 'aid', 'seemingly', 'homeless', 'Cash', '[', 'Don', 'Cheadle', ']', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'sort', 'spirit', 'guide', 'next', 'morning', 'Jack', 'up', 'find', 'been', 'transported', 'sort', 'alternate', 'universe', 'Now', 'fact', 'married', 'Kate', 'live', 'New', 'Jersey', 'have', 'several', 'adorable', 'almost', 'maintenance-free', 'kids', 'see', 'only', 'movies', 'not', 'stock', 'broker', 'life', 'tires', 'father-in-law', 'Kate', ""n't"", 'become', 'high-powered', 'attorney', 'intended', 'be', 'rather', 'one', 'who', 'poor', 'Jack', 'rest', 'movie', 'frantically', 'trying', 'get', 'old', 'life', 'back', 'Eventually', 'happiness', 'loving', 'family', 'Apparently', 'also', 'one', 'live', 'New', 'Jersey', 'sell', 'tires.Only', 'Hollywood', 'where', 'people', 'who', 'make', 'movies', 'are', 'often', 'rich', 'single', 'divorced', 'could', 'such', 'tale', 'be', 'conceived', 'aimed', 'ordinary', 'people', 'who', 'Hollywood', 'think', 'ordinary', 'where', 'oddest', 'thing', 'Family', 'Man', 'Jack', 'other', 'being', 'stuck', 'working', 'Christmas', 'Eve', ""n't"", 'seem', 'deprived', 'not', 'only', 'hectic', 'life', 'love', 'true', 'life', 'alternate', 'universe', 'charming', 'fulfilling', 'entirely', 'different', 'way', 'make', 'choices', 'life', 'prevent', 'knowing', 'what', 'lives', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'Jack', 'out', 'unknowingly', 'been', 'unhappy', 'years', 'only', 'script', 'so', 'people', 'who', 'made', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'bring', 'scoff', 'too', 'much', 'own', 'lifestyles', 'more', 'closely', 'resemble', 'wealthy', 'successful', ""Jack's.Cage"", 'Leoni', 'Cheadle', 'get', 'roles', 'effortlessly', 'used', 'acting', 'headier', 'stuff', 'movie', 'piece', 'cake', 'also', 'piece', 'cake', 'one', 'will', 'seem', 'much', 'too', 'artificially', 'sweet', 'viewers']",N/A

583077,A1CDNTB7377YH2,B00005JCCC,Michael A. Newman,"[14, 14]","This movie borrows from It's a Wonderful Life and the book Replay, where a man can go back and see how his life would be if he made a different choice.In this movie, Nicholas Cage says goodbye to his girlfriend (Kate) at the airport.  He is going to London for a job.  We next see him years later as a successful head of a large corporation, unmarried and basically involved in one-night stands.  We are later to find out that when Cage went to London, he forgot about Kate and she went her own way, never to be heard from again.Cage is on the way home from the office during a snow-storm and thwarts a robbery.  The audience expects the robber to shoot cage but instead Cage seems to convince the robber that he would be a better man if he didn't shoot Cage.  It turns out that the robber is not really a robber but a type of Angel (similar to Clarence in It's a Wonderful Life) who will give Cage a glimpse of what life would be like if he hadn't stayed in London but instead came back and married Kate.Cage goes to sleep in his luxury apartment and wakes up the next morning in a bed with an older Kate.  Cage slowly learns that he is really a married man with a family and instead of a big time corporate president, he is a tire salesman in his father-in-law's store.There are several hilarious scenes and some very touching ones.  His &quot;new&quot; life looks like a nightmare at first turns out to be the life he will eventually prefer (Some of this is reminiscent of Goldie Hawn in Overboard).  Only until he realizes this, he will not be returned to his prior life by the Angel.The director does a great job in giving us an ending that is different than what you seem to expect.  I won't say what but I think it was well done.One thing that is not explored is that when Cage's glimpsed life finishes, he will lose his two children from that glimpsed life.  The director never touches on Cage's feelings about that, unlike the novel Replay where the main character is torn apart because a child he had in an alternate life no longer exists when he is in a different reality.The movie is well cast and Don Cheadle is excellent as the &quot;angel.&quot;",4,A Really Engrossing Film,1088467200,"06 29, 2004",2004,2160,"['movie', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'book', 'Replay', 'where', 'man', 'can', 'go', 'back', 'see', 'how', 'life', 'would', 'be', 'made', 'different', 'choice.In', 'movie', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'goodbye', 'girlfriend', 'Kate', 'airport', 'going', 'London', 'job', 'next', 'see', 'years', 'later', 'successful', 'head', 'large', 'corporation', 'unmarried', 'basically', 'involved', 'one-night', 'stands', 'are', 'later', 'find', 'out', 'when', 'Cage', 'went', 'London', 'forgot', 'Kate', 'went', 'own', 'way', 'never', 'be', 'heard', 'again.Cage', 'way', 'home', 'office', 'snow-storm', 'robbery', 'audience', 'robber', 'shoot', 'cage', 'instead', 'Cage', 'convince', 'robber', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'man', 'did', ""n't"", 'shoot', 'Cage', 'out', 'robber', 'not', 'really', 'robber', 'type', 'Angel', 'similar', 'Clarence', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'who', 'will', 'give', 'Cage', 'glimpse', 'what', 'life', 'would', 'be', 'had', ""n't"", 'stayed', 'London', 'instead', 'came', 'back', 'married', 'Kate.Cage', 'sleep', 'luxury', 'apartment', 'up', 'next', 'morning', 'bed', 'older', 'Kate', 'Cage', 'slowly', 'really', 'married', 'man', 'family', 'instead', 'big', 'time', 'corporate', 'president', 'tire', 'salesman', 'father-in-law', 'are', 'several', 'hilarious', 'scenes', 'very', 'touching', 'ones', 'quot', 'new', 'quot', 'life', 'nightmare', 'first', 'out', 'be', 'life', 'will', 'eventually', 'prefer', 'reminiscent', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'Overboard', 'Only', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'returned', 'prior', 'life', 'Angel.The', 'director', 'great', 'job', 'giving', 'ending', 'different', 'what', 'seem', 'expect', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'what', 'think', 'was', 'well', 'done.One', 'thing', 'not', 'explored', 'when', 'Cage', 'glimpsed', 'life', 'finishes', 'will', 'lose', 'two', 'children', 'glimpsed', 'life', 'director', 'never', 'Cage', 'feelings', 'novel', 'Replay', 'where', 'main', 'character', 'torn', 'apart', 'child', 'had', 'alternate', 'life', 'no', 'longer', 'when', 'different', 'reality.The', 'movie', 'well', 'cast', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'excellent', 'quot', 'quot']",N/A

Cage plays Jack Campbell, a successful businessman with an eye for how to make big bucks.  On his way home from work on Christmas Eve, he interacts with Don Cheadle, who is trying to cash in a lottery ticket at a convenience store that turns into an attempted robbery.  After he successfully convinces Cheadle to accept money from him in lieu of robbery, things start to happen.  Cage wakes up on Christmas morning with a whole new life, a life he could have had with a girl he left thirteen years earlier.  Tea Leone gives a smart, evocative performance as his wife.  Cage finds himself at first completely disgusted with his new middle class life with two children, a slobbering dog and a job as a tire salesman at his father-in-law's tire store.

We meet him 13 years younger, when he's about to separate from girlfriend Kate to make an internship in London. She begs him not to go, because she's convinced his leaving will mark the end of his relationship.13 years later, we realize Kate was right. Campbell is a business mogul, single and with a lifestyle that doesn't include a wife and kids.But in Christmas' eve, Jack wakes up by divine intervention in a sort of parallel universe, where he's married to Kate, has 2 children and lives in a New Jersey suburb, and even is the local bowling team leader.Desperate and mortified, Jack makes the impossible to return to his old life, while discovering the value that brings having friend, a living wife and a beautiful family.It's in this part where Family Man gets its hook; exploiting the feelings and emotional bonds that comes with an almost perfect family.

It is a movie with heart and a movie that makes you stop to think about what's important and the choices we make.  Not to mention that Tea Leoni originally from Abilene, Texas is about the most beautiful presence to grace the widescreen since the days of Audrey Hepburn.  It makes you wonder why she hasn't appeared in more movies so we can admire her grace and style and poignant beauty.  Nicolas Cage is in his element here as well...put in an unusual circumstance the director allows him to rant and rave and scream at all things awry.  It's a good match.I had misgivings going into this from seeing the trailer, but I arrived on the other side all the more satisfied for having seen it.

Well, this film sort of gave us that.  Cage plays Jack Campbell, a wealthy Wall Street executive who is picked out by an angel, played by Don Cheadle and named Cash.  The angel sends Jack to an alternate reality where he married his sweetheart from long ago, played by T&eacute;a Leoni, had two kids, and works as a tire salesman.  Cash tells Jack that there's a lesson to be learned in all this, but that lesson is specifically tailored for Jack and unknown to Cash.  Okay, so I didn't like this film very much and I attribute that largely to who the lead was.  I like Nicolas Cage.  I've enjoyed his movies over the years...for the most part.  Here, he just seemed out of place, and I don't mean just in the alternate reality.  When he was describing the experience at the end of the film, it sounded more like he was trying to recall all the scenes that had already been filled.  I think Nicolas Cage was simply wrong for the role.  He's made much better movies than this (i.e. the National Treasure series.)  The rest of the cast was good, but without a proper leading man, there's only so much they could do.  Don Cheadle was definitely the most lively among them, but not by that much.

583111,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00005JCCC,Reviewer,"[92, 96]","In the tradition of the best films that Hollywood ever had to offer comes this refreshingly honest movie that isn't afraid to say that you don't have to be rich, hip and cynical to be successful and happy with your life.  ""The Family Man,"" directed by Brett Ratner, stars Nicolas Cage as Jack Campbell, a man who took the ""road less traveled,"" and turned his back on love for a career on Wall Street, and thirteen years later still doesn't realize how empty and shallow his life has become.  Then something happens; on Christmas Eve, Jack does a good turn to the right person at the right time.  His name is Cash (Don Cheadle), and he just happens to be a guy with, well, connections.  And the next thing Jack knows, he's getting a ""glimpse"" of what his life would have been had he made a different choice all those many years ago.  When he wakes up on Christmas morning, he's not in his bed in his penthouse apartment, but in a house in the suburbs, sleeping next to Kate Reynolds (Tea Leoni), the woman he once loved, but abandoned.  Wall Street is history; he's now a crackerjack tire salesman at ""Big Ed's,"" and he and Kate have two kids, Annie (Makenzie Vega) and Josh (Jake and Ryan Milkovich).Needless to say, Jack is confused; and the enigmatic Cash isn't about to let him in on what's going on-- that's for Jack to figure out on his own.  So Jack has no choice but to go on living his life-- even if it's not really ""his"" life.  And it becomes a journey of discovery; not only for Jack, but for the audience, as well.  And what follows may be fantasy, but it's fantasy with a message, from some filmmakers who aren't afraid to tell it like it is, and they do it well.What director Roth presents you with is an examination of what life is really all about, and what-- in the final analysis-- is really important.  And make no mistake, this isn't a film that aims for the head, it aims for the heart, scores a bullseye and doesn't apologize for it.  Is it pure, true, realistic, riveting drama?  Of course not, and it never pretends to be.  What it is, is a film that stays true to what it's all about and says some things that need to be said in this fast-food, cybersaturated world of the here and now.  It's a poignant, well made and well acted film that appeals to the universal sensibilities that in one way or another reside within even the most jaded, modernized and ""New Aged"" individuals.  Because it's an entreaty to the most basic of human needs and concerns.Cage was the perfect choice to play Jack; he's got a natural, sympathetic look that makes him easy to like, and combined with the emotional aspect he brings to the character it makes Jack someone to whom it is so easy to relate.  it's a performance that allows you to feel something; and that's really what this movie is all about, capturing that sense of humanity that is so often lacking in people's lives today.  Cage makes it work, and he makes it work beautifully, because he lets you share Jack's frustration, his loss, his fears and, most importantly, the hope and the love he ultimately realizes has been missing in his life.  It's a challenging role that Cage not only met, but surpassed with just the kind of exacting performance that was needed to put this story across.Tea Leoni gives an excellent performance, as well, as Kate.  It's a sensitive, sympathetic portrayal that serves the character and the story with great effectiveness.  Leoni makes something special out of a character that could've been just the ""female lead,"" with the purpose of being nothing more than the means of moving the story of Jack's self-discovery along.  Instead, she makes it her story as much as his by making Kate an endearing, truly integral part of the film, and she fairly sparkles on the screen.The supporting cast includes Jeremy Piven (Arnie), Saul Rubinek (Alan), Josef Sommer (Peter), Lisa Thornhill (Evelyn), Harve Presnell (Big Ed), Mary Beth Hurt (Adelle) and Francine York (Lorraine).  There's no doubt that personal experience and frame of reference is going to play a big part in the way ""The Family Man"" is received by the audience.  But Ratner, Cage, Leoni and everyone else connected with this project are to be commended for making an honest, heart-felt film with an important message about life in today's world.  It's a film that says success isn't just being the guy at the top of the heap, that it's okay to just ""be"" whomever or whatever you are, as long as it's what makes you happy and content.

But what makes &quot;The Family Man&quot; rise above? Three things: Brett Ratner's nimble direction, the performances from the principal cast, and an overwhelming sense of reality, life-switching aside. The movie always stays grounded, and presents an equal argument for the validity of Jack Campbell's choices. As a Wall Street exec, he's not a stereotypical heartless schmuck, but a guy who happens to like money, power, and luxury. Unlike other films with similar plots, Wall Street Jack cares about the world around him, as he proves when he intercedes a potential robbery. When he receives his glimpse, family life isn't better than his Wall Street life, just different. During the glimpse, Jack never forgets the fact that he shouldn't be there, and that's also a novelty in films of this sort. Family Jack fills his emotional needs with a family, but as a well-rounded character, his need for success is not completely forgotten. None of the characters in either life are one-dimensional. None of the choices in &quot;The Family Man&quot; are easy or obvious, and that's what makes it so refreshing. Even the ending is grounded in reality, because it is uncertain.

The man laughs in disbelief and tells Jack to remember that he brought this on himself as he walks away. The next morning, Jack wakes up in a house in New Jersey married to the girl he let get away 13 years before. He struggles with the changes and fights to get his old life as President of a huge Wallstreet firm back but no one from that life remembers him. Along the way, he learns a little something about life, love, and himself.My Opinion:  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Having a family myself, a lot of the points hit home. I was able to identify with Jack as he went over the sacrifices he had made for his family and the doubts and &quot;what if&quot; thoughts he had. The comparison of the two different lives that Jack could have was very interesting. I found myself being disappointed along with Jack when he found out he was a tire salesman. I wanted him to find a better job as well. I can see how people without families might have a harder time getting into this movie. It's hard to know what he is going through without feeling it yourself. That's why Jack had to actually go through it before he could figure it out for himself. We can only watch and imagine. Nicolas Cage and T&eacute;a Leoni are both excellent and give very good performances. I didn't doubt for a minute that they were married. I enjoyed the interaction between them. The daughter who knew something was wrong with her dad was a very nice touch.DVD Quality:  Widescreen Anamorphic 2.35:1, DD5.1 Sound and picture were excellent. Tons of extras including deleted scenes, outtakes, trailer, production notes, and more. This is a very robust DVD release of a good movie.What You Should Do:  See it. This DVD is a very good release and the movie is great, so it would also make a great purchase.

Not since Casablanca have I enjoyed a love story as much, and though they both end at the airport, the similarity ends there. This one is about marriage, family, and the connections and sacrifices that make marriage, parenthood and yes, love, worthwhile.Nicolas Cage plays a harried but driven Wall Street executive playboy who wakes one day to find himself trapped in a life he never wanted, married to the woman he abandoned years ago. It's a living nightmare at first, but the harder he tries to escape it, the more he begins to see that there are values and rewards that he somehow missed in his previous executive penthouse lifestyle. By the end of the movie, he's learned a lesson he will never forget.An unexplainable fantasy in the tradition of &quot;Groundhog Day&quot;, you soon find yourself accepting the unexplainable, even as the protagonist himself realizes there is no easy escape from his new reality, and learns to work within it's framework. After all, life throws all of us some unexpected &quot;curves&quot;, and like the protagonist in this modern day Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Suburban Bowling League, we can become better people by accepting and embracing the crazy things life puts us through in the name of love. Chalk one up for old-fashioned family values in a feel-good movie with a message, served up without the sappy cliches.Put the kids to bed early (The Family Man deals with some adult issues, and much as I enjoyed it, it would need a little editing before I would consider it a family film!), and just the two of you watch this one together with a bowl of popcorn and a glass of wine - you'll be glad you did!",5,Hollywood gets it right for a change!,997488000,"08 11, 2001",2001,1814,"['find', 'most', 'Hollywood', 'quot', 'quot', 'stories', 'warm', 'romantic', 'cold', 'sleepless', 'night', 'Seattle', 'then', ""'re"", 'surprise', 'Not', 'Casablanca', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'love', 'story', 'much', 'end', 'airport', 'similarity', 'there', 'one', 'marriage', 'family', 'connections', 'sacrifices', 'make', 'marriage', 'parenthood', 'yes', 'love', 'worthwhile.Nicolas', 'Cage', 'harried', 'driven', 'Wall', 'Street', 'executive', 'playboy', 'who', 'one', 'day', 'find', 'trapped', 'life', 'never', 'wanted', 'married', 'woman', 'abandoned', 'years', 'ago', 'living', 'nightmare', 'first', 'harder', 'escape', 'more', 'see', 'are', 'values', 'rewards', 'somehow', 'missed', 'previous', 'executive', 'penthouse', 'lifestyle', 'end', 'movie', 'learned', 'lesson', 'will', 'never', 'forget.An', 'unexplainable', 'fantasy', 'tradition', 'quot', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'quot', 'soon', 'find', 'accepting', 'unexplainable', 'even', 'protagonist', 'easy', 'escape', 'new', 'reality', 'work', 'framework', 'life', 'unexpected', 'quot', 'quot', 'protagonist', 'modern', 'day', 'Connecticut', 'Yankee', 'King', 'Arthur', 'Suburban', 'Bowling', 'League', 'can', 'become', 'better', 'people', 'accepting', 'embracing', 'crazy', 'things', 'life', 'name', 'love', 'Chalk', 'one', 'up', 'old-fashioned', 'family', 'values', 'feel-good', 'movie', 'message', 'served', 'up', 'sappy', 'cliches.Put', 'kids', 'bed', 'early', 'Family', 'Man', 'adult', 'issues', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'would', 'need', 'little', 'editing', 'would', 'consider', 'family', 'film', 'just', 'two', 'watch', 'one', 'together', 'bowl', 'popcorn', 'glass', 'wine', ""'ll"", 'be', 'glad', 'did']",N/A

I didn't have a proper account at the time, and I love this movie so, so much... so I just had to revise it!  Cheers, everyone.  ;)I haven't cried so much from watching a movie than I did when I watched The Family Man. It is a truly, touching, magical film about second chances. Nicolas Cage is perfect for the part of Jack Campbell, the cocky, ambitious, and selfish wall street millionaire who believed he had it all until he is approached by an Angel on Christmas Eve who knows all too well of the truth that is deep inside of Jack.That night before Christmas, Jack performs a very good deed on his way home as he stops inside a convenient store to purchase some eggnog.  He throws his own life on the line to save all who are stuck inside the store.  Therefore, this Angel grants Jack ""a glimpse.""  A glimpse of the beautiful life he could have led if he had only made different choices as a younger man. This movie is not only touching, it is a laugh riot! Watching Jack's reactions as he wakes up Christmas morning to a wife and two kids he never had.... I was crying and laughing at the same time.This movie portrays a very important message. Life is about LOVE. You could be the richest man in the world, but without the warmth of love what is there to live for?  Why all this wealth and money with nobody you love to share it with? Jack realizes after ""the glimpse"" that deep down inside of himself, he is alone... truly, and utterly alone. He really would've had it all if he had just chosen LOVE.A lot of people don't like the ending to this movie, but I believe that the producers were trying to make the audience think for themselves. Jack had to make the right decision HIMSELF, it could not be granted to him. Miracles do happen in real life, and in The Family Man, Jack experiences a miracle. He realizes that LOVE is true happiness. His life is with Kate, and he must get her back before his future closes right in front of his eyes. The ending is a very realistic ending. Jack and Kate couldn't just fall into eachother's arms and say, ""Okay! Let's begin our lives now!"" They needed to start all over again from scratch. What's meant to be will always find a way....God works his magic in mysterious ways.Over a decade later, I still bawl my eyes out each and every time I watch this extraordinary film--which has been countless times.  Guess I'm just a dumb sap like that, lol.  This will forever remain one of my favorite ""modern-day holiday classics.""  It taught me that yes, there is definitely a little thing called ""Destiny"" ... but it is ultimately up to YOU to make those decisions that you feel are absolutely right--without a doubt in your heart that will get you to what is truly yours.  Destiny will only take you so far, because everyone has a BIG thing in their lives called ""Free Will.""  It is something that God and The Angels can NEVER take away from you.  They can only 'nudge' you in the right direction.  :)  From one of my favorite song lines, ""Life's a prison when you're in love alone... I don't wanna' be alone...""  :'(  (Sorry, MAJOR SAP MOMENT THERE :P)Dear Lord, could we make things even more complicated in life or what, lol??  I know I'll keep asking for God's divine guidance and intervention because I want what is TRULY mine by divine right--nothing else!!

583136,A3M7RECGYLXOPA,B00005JCCC,The Wickerman,"[2, 3]","Here, we have yet another stellar performance from the very talented Nicolas Cage.  I was blown away by his acting in &quot;Con Air&quot; and &quot;Face Off&quot; (even though those were action movies, they still had their share of drama), and he doesn't fail to blow me away again here.  Nicolas Cage has got to be the most talented actor of our time, with the exception of Robin Williams (that guy's like superhuman when it comes to acting).  This is a story similar to that of &quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot;, where a man gets to see what his life would be like had he made different choices, except he's not dead, he's married to the girl he left in college, and they have children, and he became a family man, rather than a millionaire.  It's very interesting to watch him make the transition (he seems to be good at those kinds of parts), and try to deal with what's going on around him.  You really get caught up in the storyline.  The concept may seem a little cliche in this day in age, but it's a very interesting story (you can't wait to find out what's going to happen next), and there are a lot of good dramatic scenes.  I never cry at movies (I never saw what was so dramatic about &quot;Titanic&quot;, I mean come on, that Leo guy can't act to save his life!), but I think I came closer to doing it here than in any movie I've ever seen (well, this and &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;).  Tea Leoni is just amazing (I can't believe she's the same person who was in that awful sitcom), and Don Cheadle is really talented, too (although he was barely in the movie).

583137,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00005JCCC,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[1, 3]","Jack Campbell (Nicholas Cage) is the President of a large brokerage firm in New York. He has a fantastic office, a great apartment, an expensive car and a closet full of expensive suits. His life is the job. He is leading his company through the final stages of a huge merger when a co-worker laments about working late. It is Christmas Eve after all. Jack explains that they can all celebrate Christmas on the 26th, after the deal closes and they are looking at '10 zeroes'. On his way home, he stops in a store and prevents a hold up. Cash (Don Cheadle), the potential thief,  is actually an angel sent to Earth to give Jack a glimpse of what his life could've been. Before you know it, Jack wakes up in bed with his wife, Kate (Tea Leoni), in Teaneck, New Jersey. Kate was his college sweetheart, but they broke up soon after Jack took an internship in London. The two kids and slobbering dog bound in and wake them up. It's Christmas, daddy! Jack freaks out and drives to New York and finds out that he no longer exists. He returns to the burbs and tries to acclimate to his new life.""The Family Man"", directed by Brett Rattner (""Rush Hour"") is a film that I did not rush out to see. Last summer, I watched a terrific Australian film called ""Me Myself I"" starring Rachel Griffiths. It explores exactly the same territory. If I didn't know better, I would say that ""The Family Man"" is a remake, but the Australian film was not credited as a source.""The Family Man"" is also very similar to the classic ""It's A Wonderful Life"". Both films explore the lives of men that are interested in change and both men get to see what their lives would be like if they were changed. There is a key difference and this difference is why ""The Family Man"" ultimately does not work. In ""It's A Wonderful Life"", James Stewart's character does not fulfill his dreams, but he actually likes his life. When things get very bad, all of the sacrifices he has made throughout his life come crashing down and make him resentful. He gets to see what his life would be like if he had never been born. In ""The Family Man"", Jack Campbell is very successful and seems to enjoy his life immensely. His old girlfriend calls, which prompts about a moment of misgiving. Then he is back to business. The glimpse of his alternate life is forced upon him. He soon comes to accept it, but he never really wanted it and it takes him a long time to realize that he was missing anything. ""It's A Wonderful Life"" is about a man's glimpse of a life that he doesn't really want. He is given the glimpse because he has helped a lot of people and his misgivings are misplaced. ""The Family Man"" is about a selfish man that really isn't interested in changing. His alternate life is forced upon him, beating him over the head until he accepts it. This is supposed to make us feel warm and fuzzy, but it only made me annoyed.The best thing about ""The Family Man"" is actually the family woman. Tea' Leoni plays Kate, Jack's girlfriend/ wife. She is simply great. I believed she was married, made a few sacrifices and now really enjoys her life, with this man, with her two children. She is a wife I would like to have. Funny, sexy, loving, sarcastic, demanding. This is also the first major role for Tea'. Yes, I know she was the star of ""Deep Impact"", but she acted against a rock. In ""The Family Man', well, she acts against a rock.No, that isn't fair. Nicholas Cage actually does a pretty good job. But to make this film successful, and the perennial Christmas classic it wants so bad to be, Jack needed to have a little more doubt. As I said, he loves his life. Why is it necessary to show him an alternate? He isn't thinking about suicide, he isn't unhappy, he isn't destitute. The journey becomes meaningless because the main character does not want the journey.""The Family Man"" is the perfect film to catch on video or on cable because it has some pleasant moments that might make you smile.
