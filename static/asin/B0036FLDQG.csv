It occurred to me that the film should have been divided into two - the banal first part, which runs nearly 2 hours, and then the metaphysical second part, which could be a sequel running 70 minutes or so, and containing some extraordinary geological features and special effects, easily the most interesting components of this curious film.",3,A Rocky Road to hoe ...,1284249600,"09 12, 2010",2010,716,"['started', 'viewing', 'film', 'particular', 'preconceptions', 'got', 'restive', 'first', 'hour', 'then', 'hour', 'went', 'then', 'thought', 'film', 'had', 'finished', 'then', 'got', 'second', 'wind', 'became', 'suspiciously', 'metaphysical', 'finally', 'ended', '3', 'hours', '12', 'minutes', 'was', 'exhausted', 'torpor', 'was', 'point', 'Castaneda', 'inspired', 'nonsense', 'occurred', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'divided', 'two', 'banal', 'first', 'part', 'nearly', '2', 'hours', 'then', 'metaphysical', 'second', 'part', 'could', 'be', 'sequel', 'running', '70', 'minutes', 'so', 'containing', 'extraordinary', 'geological', 'features', 'special', 'effects', 'easily', 'most', 'interesting', 'components', 'curious', 'film']",N/A

Leaving aside the gay aspect, which will keep many people away (their loss), there is the length. Three hours.  It will not accommodate your desire for linear exposition.  It is neither cute nor campy.  There are no bangs.  You must either submit yourself to its time frame or just watch something else.  You must also watch more with your right brain than your left.  You will not get a quick fix.  You must hold every scene in your consciousness without expecting it to make sense immediately, but rather let succeeding scenes - like pixels - build up the overall image.  Along the way you will be treated to some beautiful imagery, much of it chiaroscuro.  If you can manage all this, you might at least appreciate what the director attempts.  Whether you will think he succeeds is another matter.  Some artistic efforts are worth experiencing even if, in the long run, you don't particularly like or agree with the result.  Being broadened has some value.  However, since this is not what would normally be termed ""entertainment"", you might be advised to rent before you buy.Personally this was good experience for me.  And a moving one.  But it does demand some work on the viewer's part.

Schneider ""old movie buff""","[5, 11]","I have to say, aside from some nudity, this is the most boring, artsy-fartsy piece of crap I've suffered through in many a year. It reeks of pretension, in camera work, lighting, the lack of any through story line, you name it. According to the liner notes, there's a love affair between two guys and one is abducted and the other has to find him, calling on the help of a mysterious ""fairy godmother"" or something. After an hour of film, I couldn't even figure out who the protagonists were! There was a woman in the beginning who, after 15 minutes or so of wandering around at night, meets a guy and they laugh and then it rains and they go to his apartment and make love and then she gets up and looks out the window and a voiceover runs on about fate and choices and she vanishes, fading away. But then the scene shifts all over the place with what looks to be two people meeting and you think: A-ha! These are our two lovers!...only one drifts away and the other finds somebody else...who wanders off. After about 10 people, you don't know (or care) who our heroes are eventually going to be. If the two guys that I think are the heroes are indeed the heroes, then they finally meet a one hour and 47 minutes into the film! If they're having a reunion, then I must have dozed off during their first encounter.

There is more full male nudity than in any other non-porn movie I have ever seen, and the casual way it is handled is marvelously refreshing; but despite abundant nudity and the theme of gay love interrupted and reclaimed, this is the LEAST erotic and the LEAST romantic movie I have seen in ages.Every second of its over three hours is so tightly choreographed, every slightest movement so obsessively under the director's control, that it might as well be claymation. It is bloodless and cold, so cerebral that the flesh on abundant display might just as well be clay in an animator's studio.As long as I had no idea who anybody was, how they were related to one another, and what the point of the movie was, I was fascinated just watching the people move like dancers through the fantastic sets and landscapes. But when its point began to come clear, that point was so trite that I wished it had stayed cold and confusing but fascinating to watch.Overall, though, I'm glad I watched it, because it changed ME in a way I never would have expected. I discovered for the first time that I've spent all my life thinking of Mexico as a barbaric country full of poverty, drug lords, brutality, violence, filth, ugliness and absolutely nothing worthwhile.
