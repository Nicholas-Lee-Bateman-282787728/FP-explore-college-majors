830350,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B0002COTDA,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[5, 6]","How can you not love Columbo, the disarming detective with the absent-minded demeanor who unnerves heinous murderers from their ivory towers?  The first season probably deserves five stars for its innovation and development.  The pilot movie delighted audiences with its surprises and characterization.  There are skillful performances throughout and interesting cases to boot.  One could find minor qualms almost from the series' success and continuing improvement.  There are a few episodes that bring a cliff-hanger and depend on Columbo's assumptions of human nature to unravel their crimes.  They aren't always coincidences, but chance plays into Columbo's hand a little too neatly sometimes.Despite this picky complaint, the crimes presented seem flawless by those living the lifestyles of the rich and arrogant, and it Columbo's finesse as a man with everyman's savy that has delighted audiences for decades.  He's still the TV detective to beat.  (Leslie Nielsen [playing it straight--no less!] Jack Cassidy, Lee Grant, and Ross Martin are just a few of the guest cast who make the adventures authentic.  Roddy McDowell, subjectively, is the smoothest murderer of the bunch.)  The debut season is a good start to a great television series.",4,Good Start for a Great Detective,1156032000,"08 20, 2006",2006,1247,"['How', 'can', 'not', 'love', 'Columbo', 'disarming', 'detective', 'absent-minded', 'demeanor', 'who', 'heinous', 'murderers', 'ivory', 'towers', 'first', 'season', 'probably', 'five', 'stars', 'innovation', 'development', 'pilot', 'movie', 'delighted', 'audiences', 'surprises', 'characterization', 'are', 'skillful', 'performances', 'interesting', 'cases', 'boot', 'One', 'could', 'find', 'minor', 'qualms', 'almost', 'series', 'success', 'continuing', 'improvement', 'are', 'few', 'episodes', 'bring', 'cliff-hanger', 'depend', 'Columbo', 'assumptions', 'human', 'nature', 'unravel', 'crimes', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'coincidences', 'chance', 'plays', 'Columbo', 'hand', 'little', 'too', 'neatly', 'sometimes.Despite', 'picky', 'complaint', 'crimes', 'presented', 'seem', 'flawless', 'living', 'lifestyles', 'rich', 'arrogant', 'Columbo', 'finesse', 'man', 'everyman', 'savy', 'delighted', 'audiences', 'decades', 'still', 'TV', 'detective', 'beat', 'Leslie', 'Nielsen', '[', 'playing', 'straight', 'less', ']', 'Jack', 'Cassidy', 'Lee', 'Grant', 'Ross', 'Martin', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'guest', 'cast', 'who', 'make', 'adventures', 'authentic', 'Roddy', 'McDowell', 'subjectively', 'smoothest', 'murderer', 'bunch', 'debut', 'season', 'good', 'start', 'great', 'television', 'series']",Columbo: The Complete First Season

830352,A3JXOXKWOIETIY,B0002COTDA,"Adam Bernstein ""sixtiesuniverse""","[9, 10]","This first season DVD set of Columbo towers over anything currently running on TV.  Peter Falk stands alone as the only TV cops who is cool, smart, funny, and has a heart.  I've been watching Columbo since the '70s, but never saw most of these episodes, apparently taken out of the rerun list.  This world of Columbo is kind of an alternate reality, where the good guy IS good and the bad guys ARE bad, rich, and overconfident.  Our world unfortunately is more ambiguous.The first is Prescription: Murder, the 1968 original movie based on the play, and the only episode officially from the 1960s. Gene Barry plays a psychiatrist who murders his wife and his weak link is his actress girlfriend. There is one scene where the Lieutenant gets rough with her in the sound stage, something not ever done in later episodes. And look for a guy's shadow in the background in the same scene (where they are supposedly alone). Another detail of interest is the guy who makes the false confession is the same actor who played the killer in the contemporaneous ""In the Heat of the Night"". And Falk here has short hair, not so the later ones.In Ransom For A Dead Man, the 1971 pilot film we get Lee Grant as a lawyer who kills her husband and makes it look like a kidnaping. Patricia Mattick plays the step-daughter who sets her up (she died of cancer in 2003). Here we see Falk having fully fleshed out the character as the seemingly absent-minded cop who is really sharp as a whip. The ending of this one is both well written and well acted as Columbo finds the key: conscience or lack thereof. Also the scenes are done with some cinematic flare, for instance when Lee Grant first appears her eyes intersperse with the car headlights. One inconsistency here is why would she tell Columbo about the autophone device, kind of self-incriminating herself.In Murder By The Book directed by Steven Spielberg and starring Jack Cassidy (David Cassidy's father) as the killer, we get some humor in the flaky character played by Barbara Colby who tries to extort money from Cassady, but gets killed by him instead. Colby ironically was killed in real life a few years after this episode, but that was never solved. So why would Cassady withdraw the 15 grand hush money if he was going to kill her anyway? Wouldn't it look suspicious. The killers always make at least one dumb mistake.Death Lends A Hand--This one with Robert Culp is a bit more convoluted as he portrays a contemptable PI. The big mistake here is the victim herself: why would she go to Culp's pad to begin with?Dead Weight has Eddie Albert as a war hero killer (not neccessarily an irony) and Suzanne Pleshette as the witness. I like how the series portrays psychiatrists, lawyers, war heros, etc. as killers. Makes a statement of the times: these professions don't neccessarily contain such noble people, a thinly vieled counter-cultural thread running through.Suitable For Framing stars Ross Martin as a pretentious annoying art critic killer. I love the ending with the gloves.Lady In Waiting is well done and stars Leslie Nielsen as the killer's boyfriend.Short Fuse stars Roddy McDowell as a mod PHD killer, and this one is the most convoluted episode of all. Pretty hard to follow really, but has a memorable ending.Blueprint For Murder stars Patrick O'Neal as an architect killer and the plot here doesn't really make sense. Why would he induce Columbo to dig up the pile while the body sits somewhere else, and then try to put the body in afterwards? The logic here fails bigtime. And of course the dumb mistakes he makes like turning the radio of the victim to a classical station when everyone knows he only listens to country.But all these episodes are worth watching for one main reason. Peter Falk and our delight at watching him insinuate himself into the life of the killer 'til they get annoyed and then get NAILED.I also recommend the great film Wings of Desire, the Falk plays himself, but everyone stills calls him ""Lieutenant"".",5,"Columbo first Season: Cop with heart and mind, very rare",1112313600,"04 1, 2005",2005,3993,"['first', 'season', 'DVD', 'set', 'Columbo', 'towers', 'anything', 'currently', 'running', 'TV', 'Peter', 'Falk', 'alone', 'only', 'TV', 'cops', 'who', 'cool', 'smart', 'funny', 'heart', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'Columbo', ""'70s"", 'never', 'saw', 'most', 'episodes', 'apparently', 'taken', 'out', 'rerun', 'list', 'world', 'Columbo', 'kind', 'alternate', 'reality', 'where', 'good', 'guy', 'IS', 'good', 'bad', 'guys', 'ARE', 'bad', 'rich', 'overconfident', 'world', 'unfortunately', 'more', 'ambiguous.The', 'first', 'Prescription', 'Murder', '1968', 'original', 'movie', 'based', 'play', 'only', 'episode', 'officially', '1960s', 'Gene', 'Barry', 'psychiatrist', 'who', 'wife', 'weak', 'link', 'actress', 'girlfriend', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'Lieutenant', 'rough', 'sound', 'stage', 'something', 'not', 'ever', 'done', 'later', 'episodes', 'look', 'guy', 'shadow', 'background', 'same', 'scene', 'where', 'are', 'supposedly', 'alone', 'detail', 'interest', 'guy', 'who', 'false', 'confession', 'same', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'killer', 'contemporaneous', 'Heat', 'Night', 'Falk', 'here', 'short', 'hair', 'not', 'so', 'later', 'ones.In', 'Ransom', 'A', 'Dead', 'Man', '1971', 'pilot', 'film', 'get', 'Lee', 'Grant', 'lawyer', 'who', 'husband', 'look', 'kidnaping', 'Patricia', 'Mattick', 'step-daughter', 'who', 'up', 'died', 'cancer', '2003', 'Here', 'see', 'Falk', 'having', 'fully', 'fleshed', 'out', 'character', 'seemingly', 'absent-minded', 'cop', 'who', 'really', 'sharp', 'whip', 'ending', 'one', 'well', 'written', 'well', 'acted', 'Columbo', 'key', 'conscience', 'lack', 'thereof', 'Also', 'scenes', 'are', 'done', 'cinematic', 'flare', 'instance', 'when', 'Lee', 'Grant', 'first', 'eyes', 'intersperse', 'car', 'headlights', 'One', 'inconsistency', 'here', 'why', 'would', 'tell', 'Columbo', 'autophone', 'device', 'kind', 'self-incriminating', 'herself.In', 'Murder', 'Book', 'directed', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'starring', 'Jack', 'Cassidy', 'David', 'Cassidy', 'father', 'killer', 'get', 'humor', 'flaky', 'character', 'played', 'Barbara', 'Colby', 'who', 'extort', 'money', 'Cassady', 'killed', 'instead', 'Colby', 'ironically', 'was', 'killed', 'real', 'life', 'few', 'years', 'episode', 'was', 'never', 'solved', 'why', 'would', 'Cassady', 'withdraw', '15', 'grand', 'hush', 'money', 'was', 'going', 'kill', 'anyway', 'Would', ""n't"", 'look', 'suspicious', 'killers', 'always', 'make', 'least', 'one', 'dumb', 'mistake.Death', 'Hand', 'one', 'Robert', 'Culp', 'bit', 'more', 'convoluted', 'contemptable', 'PI', 'big', 'mistake', 'here', 'victim', 'herself', 'why', 'would', 'go', 'Culp', 'pad', 'begin', 'Dead', 'Weight', 'Eddie', 'Albert', 'war', 'hero', 'killer', 'not', 'neccessarily', 'irony', 'Suzanne', 'Pleshette', 'witness', 'how', 'series', 'psychiatrists', 'lawyers', 'war', 'heros', 'etc', 'killers', 'Makes', 'statement', 'times', 'professions', 'do', ""n't"", 'neccessarily', 'contain', 'such', 'noble', 'people', 'thinly', 'vieled', 'counter-cultural', 'thread', 'running', 'through.Suitable', 'Framing', 'stars', 'Ross', 'Martin', 'pretentious', 'annoying', 'art', 'critic', 'killer', 'love', 'ending', 'gloves.Lady', 'Waiting', 'well', 'done', 'stars', 'Leslie', 'Nielsen', 'killer', 'boyfriend.Short', 'Fuse', 'Roddy', 'McDowell', 'mod', 'PHD', 'killer', 'one', 'most', 'convoluted', 'episode', 'Pretty', 'hard', 'follow', 'really', 'memorable', 'ending.Blueprint', 'Murder', 'stars', 'Patrick', ""O'Neal"", 'architect', 'killer', 'plot', 'here', ""n't"", 'really', 'make', 'sense', 'Why', 'would', 'induce', 'Columbo', 'dig', 'up', 'pile', 'body', 'somewhere', 'else', 'then', 'try', 'put', 'body', 'afterwards', 'logic', 'here', 'bigtime', 'course', 'dumb', 'mistakes', 'turning', 'radio', 'victim', 'classical', 'station', 'when', 'everyone', 'only', 'country.But', 'episodes', 'are', 'worth', 'watching', 'one', 'main', 'reason', 'Peter', 'Falk', 'delight', 'watching', 'insinuate', 'life', 'killer', 'get', 'annoyed', 'then', 'get', 'NAILED.I', 'also', 'recommend', 'great', 'film', 'Wings', 'Desire', 'Falk', 'everyone', 'stills', 'Lieutenant']",Columbo: The Complete First Season
830353,ABGAL4ZQ7ZG0Z,B0002COTDA,Adelaidian,"[4, 5]","We know who did it from the beginning but it's still interesting to see Detective Columbo of the LAPD track down the murderer. Columbo often works on hunches and by the end of each episode he has enough evidence for an arrest. It's not as flashy as any of today's criminal investigation shows but the characters and story lines are still great. What really adds to the entertainment value though is that this shabby (and sometimes dopey) looking detective's suspect is often someone who drives a fancy car and comes from the high end of society.In front of the camera, there are guest stars such as Leslie Nielsen and Robert Culp (who also appears in season 2), while behind the camera are legendary names such as Steven Spielberg and Steven Bochco. All of this adds up to a great first season with few weak moments. Must also add that the quality of the picture transfer to DVD is great. The early 70s colours are just fantastic.There are no special features included with this set but as I bought the region 4 edition of season one, I do get to see and hear the original Universal MCA-TV title at the end of the closing credits for each episode. I'm not sure why but this title is missing from most region 1 Universal TV releases (including my copy of Columbo season two).",5,Substance over style for this detective.,1171065600,"02 10, 2007",2007,1274,"['know', 'who', 'did', 'beginning', 'still', 'interesting', 'see', 'Detective', 'Columbo', 'LAPD', 'track', 'down', 'murderer', 'Columbo', 'often', 'hunches', 'end', 'episode', 'enough', 'evidence', 'arrest', 'not', 'as', 'flashy', 'today', 'criminal', 'investigation', 'shows', 'characters', 'story', 'lines', 'are', 'still', 'great', 'What', 'really', 'entertainment', 'value', 'though', 'shabby', 'sometimes', 'dopey', 'looking', 'detective', 'suspect', 'often', 'someone', 'who', 'fancy', 'car', 'high', 'end', 'society.In', 'front', 'camera', 'are', 'guest', 'stars', 'such', 'Leslie', 'Nielsen', 'Robert', 'Culp', 'who', 'also', 'season', '2', 'camera', 'are', 'legendary', 'names', 'such', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'Steven', 'Bochco', 'up', 'great', 'first', 'season', 'few', 'weak', 'moments', 'Must', 'also', 'add', 'quality', 'picture', 'transfer', 'DVD', 'great', 'early', '70s', 'colours', 'are', 'just', 'fantastic.There', 'are', 'special', 'features', 'included', 'set', 'bought', 'region', '4', 'edition', 'season', 'one', 'do', 'get', 'see', 'hear', 'original', 'Universal', 'MCA-TV', 'title', 'end', 'closing', 'credits', 'episode', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'title', 'missing', 'most', 'region', '1', 'Universal', 'TV', 'releases', 'including', 'copy', 'Columbo', 'season', 'two']",Columbo: The Complete First Season

830362,A2SWW3OWEGLN2O,B0002COTDA,Andrew Kear,"[2, 2]","Columbo is one of television most enduring characters. With his scruffy hair, raincoat, and cigar he is an unforgettable character. Columbo uses these traits successfully against the criminals he encounters. Initially, his somewhat unkempt appearances along with his ridiculously shabby car give his opponents the impression that he is not much of a threat.  However, as the classic adage goes, don't judge a book by its cover. Unlike many other detective series Columbo reveals the perpetrator of the crime at the beginning of the show. The fun is watching Columbo pick apart the clues and gradually break down his opponents. Columbo usually starts out complimentary towards his rivals, especially if they are a famous celebrity. To put the criminal off guard Columbo usually will say something like, ""my wife is a big fan of yours"". This usually makes the criminal less threatened by Columbo. However, as the show progresses Columbo can become increasingly more aggressive and points out clues to the perpetrator, never really telling them if they are guilty. This makes the guilty increasingly annoyed and alas complacent.  Columbo really is the master of psychological warfare.  By the end of the show Columbo has one final clue, that the viewer usually misses, and which ultimately seals the case.With other detective shows so reliant on car chases and gun play Columbo was and is a refreshing escape. What is surprising is that there really has never been a rival to Columbo since it first aired in the late sixties. Maybe Monk was another eccentric detective that rivals Columbo, but the plots to that show tended to be more outlandish. What made Columbo special was it was more grounded in reality, and the plots never seemed implausible.

830376,A2CZPM110DW516,B0002COTDA,"Brian W. Fairbanks ""Brian W. Fairbanks""","[4, 5]","Peter Falk first played Lt. Columbo in the 1968 made for television movie ""Prescription: Murder"" in which he squared-off against Gene Barry's wife murdering psychiatrist. According to Katharine Sharp in her book, ""Mr. and Mrs. Hollywood,"" the movie was the highest rated program of the week when it aired on NBC. The network wanted a series, but Falk balked, not wishing to commit himself to a weekly hour show especially since the Columbo format relied on how the detective trapped his prey and its entertainment value was dependent on the interchange between the detective and the culprit. It might have been too clever to remain fresh and exciting when 22 to 24 episodes were produced each year.Three years later, however, Falk changed his mind when Universal and NBC proposed the Mystery Movie format. Instead of airing weekly, ""Columbo"" would rotate with two other series, ""McCloud"" and ""McMillan and Wife,"" in one 90 minute time slot. A second movie, ""Ransom for a Dead Man,"" aired to strong ratings in early 1971, and the series kicked off in September of that year, becoming an immediate hit.The two pilot films are included, along with all seven of the first season's episodes, in Universal's five DVD set, Columbo: The Complete First Season. The original film remains as strong as I remembered it upon first viewing way back in `68, as well as when it was repeated in the `90s on ABC which had revived ""Columbo"" for a highly rated but far less memorable run. Falk is more hard-edged in the first film, not yet having given Columbo the warm puppy-dog quality that endeared the character to millions. He loses his temper when interrogating Katherine Justice, the lovely young psychiatric patient who is an accessory to Barry's crime. In most of the episodes to follow, Falk rarely lost his cool, disarming the killers with his friendly, often outwardly befuddled demeanor.""Death Lends a Hand,"" the first episode produced for the series but the second to air (network brass thought ""Murder by the Book,"" a Steven Spielberg directed show, was stronger, but I disagree), finds Columbo fully formed. He amuses Robert Culp's private investigator who is unaware that the detective wants to read his palm only to see if he's wearing the kind of sharp ring that left a mark on the victim. Culp's amusement doesn't last long, though, as Columbo calmly and carefully sets the trap that will reveal his guilt. The contrast between Falk and Culp makes this one of the strongest episodes, and it's no surprise that the former star of ""I Spy"" would be invited back twice in the following seasons to match wits with the detective. Falk is calm, friendly, amusing, and disheveled. Culp is cool, even cold, condescending, and well-tailored.""Dead Weight,"" the first season's third episode, is less memorable, but goes down well due to the casting of Eddie Albert as a highly decorated general patterned on George Patton, the subject of a popular and Oscar winning movie the previous year. Albert cuts an impressive figure and is such a good actor that he easily shakes off memories of Oliver Douglas, the hapless hero of the long running sitcom ""Green Acres."" There's a glint in his eye that conveys as much menace as charm. Suzanne Pleshette is delightful as the uncertain witness to his crime. Even Timothy Carey, a frequent villain on the big screen, shows up as the proprietor of the diner where Columbo eats the first of many bowls of chili he would enjoy in the series.Other highlights include ""Short Fuse"" with Roddy McDowall, and ""Suitable for Framing"" with Ross Martin (Artemis Gordon from ""The Wild, Wild West""), but each of the seven episodes (nine if you count the two pilots) are worthwhile and enjoyable. The only drawback to this set is the lack of any extras. A show as long-lived, as well as both critically and popularly acclaimed, deserves a documentary or two that provides background on the character and his development. For instance, is it true that the role of Columbo was first offered to Bing Crosby?Brian W.

830389,A26BWRBPP4V2WF,B0002COTDA,Craig MACKINNON,"[10, 13]","Columbo is probably my favourite television sleuth.  The combination of smart writing and great performances (mostly) highlight this package of early Columbo episodes, including a very young-looking Peter Falk in the first Columbo movie included in this set (produced 3 years before the rest of the shows on the disc).  As you might expect, there is some variation in Peter Falk's characterisation of Columbo, as the writers and actors had not settled on his final personality until the middle of this first season.For those that don't know Columbo, every episode follows the same basic path.  The viewers know how the villian committed the murder - the mystery is not how the murder was committed, but what little slipup the murderer made that Columbo will discover.  Early episodes seem to ""cheat"" a little bit - a new piece of evidence is introduced near the end seemingly out of nowhere.  That's not to say that we always know exactly what's going on - for example, we don't know what happened to the body in ""Blueprint for Murder"" until Columbo discovers it.  Likewise we don't know what happened to the murder weapon (a gun) in ""Dead Weight.""  The fun is not so much trying to figure out how the murder was committed (which is what happens in most murder mystery shows) but rather how Columbo figures out the crime.So why only 3 stars?  Well, basically because the early episodes (even the Steven Spielberg-helmed ""Murder by the Book"") are not as good as later episodes would be.  The performances aren't always the greatest - ""Dead Weight"" is the low point in that respect.  Alternatively, there are some great performances (some by notables such as Robert Culp and Leslie Neilson - in his pre-""Airplane"" days).  Unfortunately, there are no extras of any kind - I guess we should be happy that shows this old are available at all on DVD.  The shows themselves are eminently watchable, and have aged well.  The visuals are crisp and the sound is pretty good.  So pick up a copy of this DVD, because many of the shows (especially the later ones) are among the greatest detective stories ever penned for television.",3,"As with many first seasons, sometimes uneven - and no extras",1113696000,"04 17, 2005",2005,2119,"['Columbo', 'probably', 'favourite', 'television', 'sleuth', 'combination', 'smart', 'writing', 'great', 'performances', 'mostly', 'highlight', 'package', 'early', 'Columbo', 'episodes', 'including', 'very', 'young-looking', 'Peter', 'Falk', 'first', 'Columbo', 'movie', 'included', 'set', 'produced', '3', 'years', 'rest', 'shows', 'disc', 'might', 'expect', 'variation', 'Peter', 'Falk', 'characterisation', 'Columbo', 'writers', 'actors', 'had', 'not', 'settled', 'final', 'personality', 'middle', 'first', 'season.For', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Columbo', 'episode', 'same', 'basic', 'path', 'viewers', 'know', 'how', 'villian', 'committed', 'murder', 'mystery', 'not', 'how', 'murder', 'was', 'committed', 'what', 'little', 'slipup', 'murderer', 'made', 'Columbo', 'will', 'discover', 'Early', 'episodes', 'seem', 'cheat', 'little', 'bit', 'new', 'piece', 'evidence', 'introduced', 'end', 'seemingly', 'nowhere', 'not', 'say', 'always', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'going', 'example', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'body', 'Blueprint', 'Murder', 'Columbo', 'discovers', 'Likewise', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'murder', 'weapon', 'gun', 'Dead', 'Weight', 'fun', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'murder', 'was', 'committed', 'what', 'most', 'murder', 'mystery', 'shows', 'rather', 'how', 'Columbo', 'out', 'crime.So', 'why', 'only', '3', 'stars', 'Well', 'basically', 'early', 'episodes', 'even', 'Steven', 'Spielberg-helmed', 'Murder', 'Book', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'later', 'episodes', 'would', 'be', 'performances', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'greatest', 'Dead', 'Weight', 'low', 'point', 'respect', 'Alternatively', 'are', 'great', 'performances', 'notables', 'such', 'Robert', 'Culp', 'Leslie', 'Neilson', 'pre-', 'Airplane', 'days', 'Unfortunately', 'are', 'extras', 'kind', 'guess', 'should', 'be', 'happy', 'old', 'are', 'available', 'DVD', 'shows', 'are', 'eminently', 'watchable', 'have', 'aged', 'well', 'visuals', 'are', 'crisp', 'sound', 'pretty', 'good', 'So', 'pick', 'up', 'copy', 'DVD', 'many', 'shows', 'especially', 'later', 'ones', 'are', 'greatest', 'detective', 'stories', 'ever', 'penned', 'television']",Columbo: The Complete First Season

Sure, I had seen him on some of his numerous movies made later on, and was familiar with his dry sense of humor.  When I rented this series, however, I was not expecting it to be so good.The budget on these shows must have been high, and I would really consider them movies, especially the first couple of episodes.  Prescription for Murder was a very classy show as was Ransom for a Dead Man.  As the series progressed, you could see a visual change, a reduction in budget, some repainted scenes, but overall, the shows were excellent, and all very classy, especially considering the time period.I really find it amazing to watch a detective show, where the opening scene is seeing someone committ a murder, and then trying to see how the detective solves it.  I mean, the concept seems weak, it seems like it would be easy to solve it, but there are always some very interesting twists in the investigation that makes it more interesting.  Sometimes, it seems a bit unrealistic that Columbo bites on the perpetrator right away, and sometimes the deductive logic has gaps.  Still, there are times when crime scene investigation techniques seem lacking, even for the time period (like not checking for fingerprints).  Yet these indiscrepancies are rare, and take some careful viewing to find.  Overall, the stories feel intellegent, and while the detective work is based largely on evidence, keen observations and the occasional hunch seems to give Columbo an edge.Overall, the series has its faults, but it is a real gem just waiting to be rediscovered.

What I was looking for at the time however, was really Columbo. I can remember back in the '70s, when we all watched TV together as a family, Sunday nights were a big TV night because of The Wonderful World of Disney, and the ABC Mystery Movie. Columbo was always my personal fave, though the others were good too. I come here once in a while and search for stuff that I'd like to get on AIV, and was delighted to see that Season One (at least) was available. While I don't remember seeing many of these particular episodes back then, I remember the feel of them. I remember the rumpled, seemingly-bumbling detective, the beautiful ladies, the handsome men. I mean, come on! Just in this first season you have Lee Grant, Jack Cassidy, Anne Francis, Roddy McDowall, Suzanne Pleshette, Martin Milner (who, according to IMDB, played Officer Pete Malloy in three different TV series in ADDITION to ADAM-12), and a very dashing Leslie Nielsen. You'll also see many excellent character actors and others who later went on to star in regular series TV. These are not generally Emmy-winning performances, just fine 90-minute mysteries with a bit of morality tale, driven by the ever-persistent undauntable Lieutenant Columbo.

830410,A3MQ3IIFGLQ2PO,B0002COTDA,E. Hornaday,"[118, 123]","Peter Falk's Columbo ranks as one of the greatest TV detective characters ever created. His ability to capture the kirky Los Angeles Lieutenant has captivated decades of viewers and is sure to also capture younger fans with this long-awaited DVD release.Created by Richard Levinson and William Link, the series debuted in 1971 with ""Murder by the Book,"" which was actually the third appearance of Falk's Columbo (there had been two previous two-hour NBC World Premiere Movies prior to the series launch.) Interestingly, ""Murder by the Book"" was directed by a then unknown talent: Steven Spielberg.Columbo was unique in so many ways, the first was that the viewer learned the killer's identity in the first few minutes of every episode. Up until then, detective shows and mysteries had tried to keep the audience guessing ""Who Done It?"" until the very final scene. Levinson and Link turned that formula upside down, letting viewers in on the intracacies of the crime from the killer's viewpoint, their motivation, and what they did to cover their tracks to avoid discovery.Often, Columbo was not even introduced until 20 minutes or more into the episodes (which ran a network 90 minutes with commercials instead of the usual 60 minutes for dramas.)However, as soon as the audience caught a glimpse of the short, rumpled, cigar-smoking detective with the tan rain coat, they knew that they were watching something really special. Columbo feigned a scatter-brained approach, but it was soon obvious to viewers and the episode's killer that beneath his step-and-fetch-it manner lay the cooly brilliant mind of a master detective. And, it was the cat-and-mouse interplay and dialog between Columbo and the criminal that was at the heart of this brilliant series.Smartly written and tightly crafted, the dramatic tension was created as Columbo slowly chipped away the layers of subterfuge left by the killer to reveal the mechanics of the crime and the killer.Throughout the series, which spanned three decades after several relaunches as specials, Falk's black hair turned gray, but he wore the exact same rain coat while pursuing some of the best actors and actresses on TV or in the movies who portrayed various extremes of melevolent killers. A virtual ""who's who"" of the acting profession did a turn on Columbo.To say that Columbo affected the TV mystery genre is to give it far too little credit: it changed it forever and produced a detective from which his alter ego, the vastly talented Falk, will also never be able to escape.Let's hope the studio takes a clue from Colombo and quickly releases the rest of these outstanding episodes!",5,There IS Just One More Thing...,1088467200,"06 29, 2004",2004,2638,"['Peter', 'Falk', 'Columbo', 'one', 'greatest', 'TV', 'detective', 'characters', 'ever', 'created', 'ability', 'capture', 'kirky', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Lieutenant', 'captivated', 'decades', 'viewers', 'sure', 'also', 'capture', 'younger', 'fans', 'long-awaited', 'DVD', 'release.Created', 'Richard', 'Levinson', 'William', 'Link', 'series', 'debuted', '1971', 'Murder', 'Book', 'was', 'actually', 'third', 'appearance', 'Falk', 'Columbo', 'had', 'been', 'two', 'previous', 'two-hour', 'NBC', 'World', 'Premiere', 'Movies', 'prior', 'series', 'launch', 'Interestingly', 'Murder', 'Book', 'was', 'directed', 'then', 'unknown', 'talent', 'Steven', 'Spielberg.Columbo', 'was', 'unique', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'first', 'was', 'viewer', 'learned', 'killer', 'identity', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'episode', 'then', 'detective', 'shows', 'mysteries', 'had', 'tried', 'keep', 'audience', 'guessing', 'Who', 'Done', 'very', 'final', 'scene', 'Levinson', 'Link', 'turned', 'formula', 'upside', 'down', 'letting', 'viewers', 'intracacies', 'crime', 'killer', 'viewpoint', 'motivation', 'what', 'did', 'cover', 'tracks', 'avoid', 'discovery.Often', 'Columbo', 'was', 'not', 'even', 'introduced', '20', 'minutes', 'more', 'episodes', 'ran', 'network', '90', 'minutes', 'commercials', 'instead', 'usual', '60', 'minutes', 'dramas', 'However', 'as', 'soon', 'audience', 'caught', 'glimpse', 'short', 'rumpled', 'cigar-smoking', 'detective', 'tan', 'rain', 'coat', 'knew', 'were', 'watching', 'something', 'really', 'special', 'Columbo', 'feigned', 'scatter-brained', 'approach', 'was', 'soon', 'obvious', 'viewers', 'episode', 'killer', 'step-and-fetch-it', 'manner', 'lay', 'cooly', 'brilliant', 'mind', 'master', 'detective', 'was', 'cat-and-mouse', 'interplay', 'dialog', 'Columbo', 'criminal', 'was', 'heart', 'brilliant', 'series.Smartly', 'written', 'tightly', 'crafted', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'was', 'created', 'Columbo', 'slowly', 'chipped', 'away', 'layers', 'subterfuge', 'left', 'killer', 'reveal', 'mechanics', 'crime', 'killer.Throughout', 'series', 'spanned', 'three', 'decades', 'several', 'relaunches', 'specials', 'Falk', 'black', 'hair', 'turned', 'gray', 'wore', 'exact', 'same', 'rain', 'coat', 'pursuing', 'best', 'actors', 'actresses', 'TV', 'movies', 'who', 'portrayed', 'various', 'extremes', 'melevolent', 'killers', 'virtual', 'who', 'who', 'acting', 'profession', 'did', 'turn', 'Columbo.To', 'say', 'Columbo', 'affected', 'TV', 'mystery', 'genre', 'give', 'far', 'too', 'little', 'credit', 'changed', 'forever', 'produced', 'detective', 'alter', 'ego', 'vastly', 'talented', 'Falk', 'will', 'also', 'never', 'be', 'able', 'escape.Let', 'hope', 'studio', 'clue', 'Colombo', 'quickly', 'rest', 'outstanding', 'episodes']",Columbo: The Complete First Season

An earlier reviewer states that ""Prescription: Murder"" is unusual because Columbo gets angry in it, but it should be pointed out that he gets angry in later episodes as well, such as ""Stich in Crime"" and ""Exercise in Fatality"". The actual pilot ""Ransom for a Dead Man"" is one the most outstanding episodes of them all, and here we see the first story in which ""high-technology"" or some other speciality comes into the story, in this case, aviation and automatic telephones.  Lee Grant is outstanding as the seductive, yet poisonous murderer of her well-meaning husband.  Jack Cassidy makes his debut in the first regular season episode(""Murder by the Book"") as a writer.  He was one of the best of the murderers and ended up appearing in three episodes. The young Steven Spielberg directed this episode in a very unique way (note the unusual camera angles and lighting). These are the best of the first season.  A couple of the episodes (""Dead Weight"" with Eddie Albert and ""Lady in Waiting"" with Susan Clark) are not as good as the others, but on the whole, it is worth seeing all of them.Actually, unlike most multi-year series which tend to run out of steam, some of the best episodes are in the later seasons so I hope all the seaons will eventually appear on DVD.",5,"Columbo-Great from the ""get-go""!",1115769600,"05 11, 2005",2005,1793,"['Many', 'successful', 'television', 'series', 'start', 'slowly', 'then', 'reach', 'peak', 'several', 'episodes', 'second', 'season.This', 'not', 'case', 'Columbo', 'can', 'see', 'already', 'original', 'movie', 'Prescription', 'Murder', 'was', 'NOT', 'pilot', 'Ransom', 'Dead', 'Man', 'was', 'Peter', 'Falk', 'writers', 'already', 'had', 'character', 'down', 'pat', 'references', 'wife', 'need', 'look', 'pencil', 'rumpled', 'look', 'modest', 'demeanor', 'etc', 'actually', 'old', 'Peugeot', '403', 'convertible', ""n't"", 'yet', 'made', 'appearance', 'earlier', 'reviewer', 'states', 'Prescription', 'Murder', 'unusual', 'Columbo', 'angry', 'should', 'be', 'pointed', 'out', 'angry', 'later', 'episodes', 'well', 'such', 'Stich', 'Crime', 'Exercise', 'Fatality', 'actual', 'pilot', 'Ransom', 'Dead', 'Man', 'one', 'most', 'outstanding', 'episodes', 'here', 'see', 'first', 'story', 'high-technology', 'other', 'speciality', 'story', 'case', 'aviation', 'automatic', 'telephones', 'Lee', 'Grant', 'outstanding', 'seductive', 'yet', 'poisonous', 'murderer', 'well-meaning', 'husband', 'Jack', 'Cassidy', 'debut', 'first', 'regular', 'season', 'episode', 'Murder', 'Book', 'writer', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'murderers', 'ended', 'up', 'appearing', 'three', 'episodes', 'young', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'directed', 'episode', 'very', 'unique', 'way', 'note', 'unusual', 'camera', 'angles', 'lighting', 'are', 'best', 'first', 'season', 'couple', 'episodes', 'Dead', 'Weight', 'Eddie', 'Albert', 'Lady', 'Waiting', 'Susan', 'Clark', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'others', 'whole', 'worth', 'seeing', 'them.Actually', 'most', 'multi-year', 'series', 'tend', 'run', 'out', 'steam', 'best', 'episodes', 'are', 'later', 'seasons', 'hope', 'seaons', 'will', 'eventually', 'appear', 'DVD']",Columbo: The Complete First Season

The 69 episodes are all movie-length, between 73 and 100 minutes long. The series was once broadcast on over 80 networks, spanning 44 countries. In 1997, &#34;Murder by the Book&#34; was ranked No. 16 on TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time. And in 1999, the magazine ranked Lt. Columbo No. 7 on its 50 Greatest TV Characters of All Time list. In 2012, the program was chosen as the third best cop or legal show on Best in TV: The Greatest TV Shows of Our Time. In 2013 TV Guide included it in its list of The 60 Greatest Dramas of All Time. In 2013, Writers Guild of America ranked it No. 57 in the list of 101 Best Written TV Series. My wife and I have watched each single episode dozens of times and we never get tired of watching the same ones over and over again. There are very few TV shows that I can say that about. And although we already own all episodes that were ever released on DVD, we still in fact enjoy watching them again when they are on broadcast TV. I just wish I could give this DVD series more than FIVE stars. Without a doubt, it is still my favorite TV series of all time. The famous guest stars also added to the show. Some of them appeared more than once. It would be truly hard to pick just one episode as my favorite Columbo episode.

I've seen complaints from purists who have read the book(s) these stories are based upon and complain of Falk's interpretation. My entire experience with Columbo is watching the movies, shows and specials, and I love them. Falk is completely believable as the crumpled, clever detective. He plays him as a man of simple pleasures... he enjoys good food when he can get it, the company of his dog (later seasons) and often references his never-seen wife whom is frequently out of town taking care of a family member, etc. A man of little pretense, he often shows up at the crime scenes needing coffee with a hastily grabbed breakfast of a boiled egg in his pocket.For those who have never watched, these mysteries are generally played in reverse. As the audience member you witness the criminal committing the crime first hand and are entertained as Columbo puts together the clues to find out what you already know. You get to sit back and enjoy the performance of the guests and main star as they play cat and mouse.Amazon includes the first Columbo movie, Prescription for Murder, which is not often included as part of the first season with other streaming services.

The mystery is, how is Columbo going to solve these perfectly crafted murders?If you are the murderer, you are probably arrogant and are ready to dismiss Columbo as just a bumbling policeman; nothing to worry about.  But after your first encounter with this short and somewhat comical detective, you suddenly realize that Columbo has just spotted something: a minor, insignificant flaw in your perfect plan.Before you know it, Columbo begins finding more and more little things that just don't add up.  And those loose ends that Columbo needs to tie-up, turn out to be your shoelaces.  Desperately, you try to out-maneuver this pest of a detective, but he just won't leave you alone.  Columbo spirals in tighter and tighter like a noose around your neck.Just when you think you can't stand the pressure anymore, it appears his evidence is just not solid enough; you got away with it!

830480,A29HVOSR9VLFKP,B0002COTDA,Mike  Silverman,"[1, 2]","It's kind of difficult to write a review of the Columbo series. Pretty much everyone is familiar with it already. If you don't know who Columbo is , or you never heard of him, you're probably living in Madagascar. ( the country... not the movie...).  But , as Columbo might say... ""if I could have just a minute of your time sir..."".  I'll give it a try.  Lieutenant Columbo, homicide detective of the Los Angeles Police force, would never be mistaken for that.  He dresses like a construction site manager who just stepped out of the local bar after a business lunch with his boss. One of the always-funny running jokes in the Columbo series is how many people mistake him for a vagrant or a passer-by who happened to wander into the scene of a police investigation. He's always having to pull his badge out to convince people that he belongs there. Plain-clothes indeed. There was one particularly humorous episode where his ( forever unseen...) wife got him a present of a new deep blue ( or possibly black ) trench coat to replace that rumpled old saggy bleak-beige one he typically wears.  He kept carrying the new one around, sometimes putting it on... but mostly carrying it because he just couldn't stand the feel of it, but he didn't want to disappoint his wife, so kept trying to ""accidentally"" leave it somewhere where it might get stolen.  No luck.  By the end of the episode he's forsaken the new one and is back to the tired old saggy trench coat that he loves.  There are little things like that which keep a continuity between each movie or episode ( whatever you prefer to call them...) that make Columbo feel like a quirky family relation who you enjoy seeing.  Columbo doesn't carry a gun. He made that clear, quietly, to a friend of his on the force who he paid 5 dollars to, to take his target training practice for him. ( Columbo claimed that he couldn't hit the target anyway) He was being pestered by Internal Affairs to complete his required target practice.  Again here we see that he is not a typical detective. Columbo does not grill his suspects like you might see on other police dramas or investigations.  He doesn't take them to the station and sit them in an interrogation room and give them the third degree.  In fact he is so polite, makes such a small presence of himself, is so ingratiating..., that he throws his suspects off guard. This is his well developed approach. By presenting himself as an amiable naive klutzy gumshoe detective who seems to want to be everyone's best friend, he completely disarms his suspects of any worry that he might be gradually sneaking up on them , putting clues together, and figuring out what they thought was the perfect crime. This is really the primary enjoyment of the series.  Watching Columbo in his very average looking getup, slowly, but very very persistently piece together who committed the homicide and how they did it. For Columbo, his deliberate deceptively clunky and awkward manner masks his very sharp mind and very astute eyes that don't overlook anything that might be important. And at the end of each movie or episode, we are treated to the stunned look on the murderer's face as he or she suddenly realizes that Columbo pulled one over on them and was a lot smarter than they gave him credit for.  Peter Falk has the character of Columbo nailed down to perfection. He has created an icon for all ages.  Rarely does an actor develop a character to such a fine degree that the character becomes part of our cultural background, but Columbo will be with us for as long as we have media on which to watch these great crime dramas. Columbo is unique in the cannon of detective characters, a man who even the criminals can't help but find endearing as he saunters around like your next door neighbor , a neighbor who also happens to suspect you of committing murder.  The disks are in excellent condition and perform very well for both audio and visuals.  You should buy this series. It doesn't matter if you like police drama or not, it doesn't matter if you like murder mysteries or not.  You will love this. Columbo is one series you just don't want to miss.- Mike S.",5,WHAT CAN I SAY ?,1251936000,"09 3, 2009",2009,4159,"['kind', 'difficult', 'write', 'review', 'Columbo', 'series', 'Pretty', 'much', 'everyone', 'familiar', 'already', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'Columbo', 'never', 'heard', ""'re"", 'probably', 'living', 'Madagascar', 'country', 'not', 'movie', 'Columbo', 'might', 'say', 'could', 'have', 'just', 'minute', 'time', 'sir', ""'ll"", 'give', 'try', 'Lieutenant', 'Columbo', 'homicide', 'detective', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Police', 'force', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'mistaken', 'construction', 'site', 'manager', 'who', 'just', 'stepped', 'local', 'bar', 'business', 'lunch', 'boss', 'One', 'always-funny', 'running', 'jokes', 'Columbo', 'series', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'mistake', 'vagrant', 'passer-by', 'who', 'happened', 'wander', 'scene', 'police', 'investigation', 'always', 'having', 'pull', 'badge', 'convince', 'people', 'there', 'Plain-clothes', 'indeed', 'was', 'one', 'particularly', 'humorous', 'episode', 'where', 'forever', 'unseen', 'wife', 'got', 'present', 'new', 'deep', 'blue', 'possibly', 'black', 'trench', 'coat', 'replace', 'rumpled', 'old', 'saggy', 'bleak-beige', 'one', 'typically', 'kept', 'carrying', 'new', 'one', 'around', 'sometimes', 'putting', 'mostly', 'carrying', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'stand', 'feel', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'disappoint', 'wife', 'so', 'kept', 'trying', 'accidentally', 'leave', 'somewhere', 'where', 'might', 'get', 'stolen', 'luck', 'end', 'episode', 'forsaken', 'new', 'one', 'back', 'tired', 'old', 'saggy', 'trench', 'coat', 'are', 'little', 'things', 'keep', 'continuity', 'movie', 'episode', 'prefer', 'call', 'make', 'Columbo', 'feel', 'quirky', 'family', 'relation', 'who', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'Columbo', ""n't"", 'carry', 'gun', 'made', 'clear', 'quietly', 'friend', 'force', 'who', 'paid', '5', 'dollars', 'take', 'target', 'training', 'practice', 'Columbo', 'claimed', 'could', ""n't"", 'hit', 'target', 'anyway', 'was', 'being', 'pestered', 'Internal', 'Affairs', 'complete', 'required', 'target', 'practice', 'Again', 'here', 'see', 'not', 'typical', 'detective', 'Columbo', 'not', 'grill', 'suspects', 'might', 'see', 'other', 'police', 'dramas', 'investigations', ""n't"", 'take', 'station', 'sit', 'interrogation', 'room', 'give', 'third', 'degree', 'fact', 'so', 'polite', 'small', 'presence', 'so', 'ingratiating', 'suspects', 'off', 'guard', 'well', 'developed', 'approach', 'presenting', 'amiable', 'naive', 'klutzy', 'gumshoe', 'detective', 'who', 'want', 'be', 'everyone', 'best', 'friend', 'completely', 'suspects', 'worry', 'might', 'be', 'gradually', 'sneaking', 'up', 'putting', 'clues', 'together', 'figuring', 'out', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'perfect', 'crime', 'really', 'primary', 'enjoyment', 'series', 'Watching', 'Columbo', 'very', 'average', 'looking', 'getup', 'slowly', 'very', 'very', 'persistently', 'piece', 'together', 'who', 'committed', 'homicide', 'how', 'did', 'Columbo', 'deliberate', 'deceptively', 'clunky', 'awkward', 'manner', 'masks', 'very', 'sharp', 'mind', 'very', 'astute', 'eyes', 'do', ""n't"", 'overlook', 'anything', 'might', 'be', 'important', 'end', 'movie', 'episode', 'are', 'treated', 'stunned', 'look', 'murderer', 'face', 'suddenly', 'Columbo', 'pulled', 'one', 'was', 'lot', 'smarter', 'gave', 'credit', 'Peter', 'Falk', 'character', 'Columbo', 'nailed', 'down', 'perfection', 'created', 'icon', 'ages', 'Rarely', 'actor', 'develop', 'character', 'fine', 'degree', 'character', 'part', 'cultural', 'background', 'Columbo', 'will', 'be', 'as', 'long', 'have', 'media', 'watch', 'great', 'crime', 'dramas', 'Columbo', 'unique', 'cannon', 'detective', 'characters', 'man', 'who', 'even', 'criminals', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'find', 'endearing', 'next', 'door', 'neighbor', 'neighbor', 'who', 'also', 'suspect', 'committing', 'murder', 'disks', 'are', 'excellent', 'condition', 'perform', 'very', 'well', 'audio', 'visuals', 'should', 'buy', 'series', ""n't"", 'matter', 'like', 'police', 'drama', 'not', ""n't"", 'matter', 'like', 'murder', 'mysteries', 'not', 'will', 'love', 'Columbo', 'one', 'series', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'miss.-', 'Mike', 'S']",Columbo: The Complete First Season

PRESCRIPTION: MURDER *****Doctor Ray Fleming has a problem: he is having an affair with a young woman-Joan Hudson. His wife(played by Nina Foch)suspects that he is doing more than just ""treating a patient"" when he gets a call from her and walks out in the middle of thier anisversery party. 6 months ago she gave him a choice: End this affair or face divorce. This presents the doctor with a problem-he stands to lose a lot of money if she divorces him. Solution? Murder her! A murder six months in the making, with the help of his mistress-they carry out the plot. The doctor has yet another problem: Lt. Columbo is on the case-he knows the doctor is guilty and to prove it-he sets up a very clever trap for the doctor-with the help of....you guessed it-Ms. Hudson. The best of the two pilot movies.2. RANSOM FOR A DEAD MAN ***1/2Lee Grant plays a lawyer who murders her husband and then manufactures a kidnapping. This woman is very smart! She pays the ransom of $300.000 from money from various stocks and trust accounts. She eventualy gets the money herself and hides it. There is only one problem: Part of the ransom was paid from her stepdaughter's trust account! With her help, Columbo sets up a trap to prove her guilt.3. MURDER BY THE BOOK ***This episode is noted for one of Steven Spieldberg's early directoral efforts. And overall, he did a good job. However, the director can only do much with a so-so script. This is the weakest of the first season-but Jack Cassidy and Martin Milner carry things along nicely. James Ferris and Ken Franklin(Milner and Cassidy)are part of a writing team of the Mrs Melville mystery novels. They both become rich-but Ferris wants to write on his own. What the american public doesn't know is that Ferris does all the writing and Franklin does the publicly. The break up would expose the truth and Franklin stands to lose alot. He plots the ""Perfect murder"" However, He is blackmailed by a witness and Lt. Columbo uncovers a clue that spoils his ""Perfect Murder"" It just seems that this clue was written in at the last minute-which weakens it. Still entertaining however.4. DEATH LENDS A HAND****Ray Miland plays Arthur Kenicut-a Hearst like publisher who hires a Private detective Brimmer(Robert Culp) to determine whether or not his wife is having an affair. She has been-but Brimmer falistfies the report. Her lover is none other than Brimmer himself. Now, he tries to blackmail her into being a pipeline of information-her husband has a lot of politcal connections. But She refuses to be blackmailed and threatens to tell her husband the truth about thier affair. In a fit of rage, he knocks her down and kills her. Out of fear, he covers up the accident. Lt. Columbo is on the case however and he sets up a trap for brimmer using of all things-a pair of Contact lenses!!! This episode is noted for being one of the few episodes where the murder was an accident-not premedicated.5. DEAD WEIGHT *****Eddie Albert plays General Hollister-a retired marine. Col. Dutton pays the general a visit. He tells him that the marine corps is opening a full scale investagation into arms contracts. The general's contruction company overcharged the government. The Col tells Hollister that he is leaving. Instead of risking exposure, Hollister Picks up a gun and kills Col Dutton. Unfourtanitly, Mrs. Stewart(Suzzane Pleshette)is in a sail boat with her mother and she wittnesses a shooting in the house across the marina. Her report is considered a crackpot report until Col. Dutton's body is found. Lt. Columbo is on the case. THe general's tremendous beleif in himself will give him away.6. Suitable for framing *****Dale Kingston(Ross Martin)is obsessed with his uncle's paint collection. So much so, he kills him in cold blood. With the help of his accomplce, they frame his Aunt for the crime. But Lt. Columbo is on the case and he is not taken in by his flamboyant personalty. To prove his guilt, Lt. Columbo sets up a trap using fingerprints. I just love the look on Mr. Kingston's face when he realizes that he is trapped! As a side note: Ross Martin was the one time acting teacher of Peter Falk.7. LADY IN WAITING ****1/2Susan Clark plays Beth Chadwick who is in love with the family's company's lawyer Peter Hamiltion(Leslie Nielsen)But her Brother Bryce objects to the relationship. Now beth feels that she's been controlled all her life-first by her father, now by her brother. Bryce informs Beth that he has written a letter to Peter-quit seeing beth or face being fired as the company's lawyer. Beth has had enough! She plots the murder of her brother. She kills him and make it look like an accident. In fact The jury of the inquest rules it an accident. But with Lt Columbo on the case-he's not buying it-He believes it was premedicated. Her irractional behaviouer and the answer to a crucial question that only Peter knows the answer to-proves her guilt.8. SHORT FUSE ****1/2Roddy McDowall plays Roger Stanford-a sceientst who works for Stanford chemicals-a family owned company. He is very upset with his uncle's decision to sell the company. Now he is called into his office for a meeting. He tries to blackmail Roger into leaving the company or else he will release damaging information about roger to the public. Rather than submit to blackmail, Roger kills his uncle by planting cigars that is rigged with a bomb. However, Lt. Columbo is on the case and he knows Roger is Guilty and to prove it-he takes Roger for a ride in a place where he can't run away-it is there that Columbo comfronts Roger.9. Blueprint for muder *****Beau Williamson(Forrest Tucker)is very upset. He is seen driving through town real fast. He goes to Elliot Markham's office to confront him. Without His knowlage or approval, Mr. Markham is building ""Williamson City"" A community that includes schools and hospitals and so on. But Beau objects and confronts Markham at the contruction site. When Beau gets into his car, Markham is hiding. He is forced at gunpoint to go into a nearby stable-a shot is heard. Lt. Columbo is on the case and he suspects Markham is guilty-but has a hard time proving it. It proves to be Columbo's toughest case of the first season. However, when Markham is caught trying to hide the body-in a place that has been already searched-his guilt is finally proven.So there you have it-the first season. Peter falk was born to play Columbo. Loaded with Geust stars of the finest of Hollywood-this is what makes Columbo a special show-now we await the second season!",5,"The best detective show, bar none!",1095120000,"09 14,

Since the viewers get to watch the crime happen and Columbo is almost always zeroed in on the killer right away, there's no ""whodunnit"" suspense.  Nor is there intended to be.So why is it such a great series?  That's hard to define.  Of course, there's Peter Falk as Columbo.  He's a likable actor playing a likable character, a detective who isn't nearly as bumbling as he pretends, but still isn't the least bit hard-boiled.  In any of these episodes, Columbo isn't so much the star as one of a strong ensemble cast.  And those casts are another remarkable feat.  The acting in any episode of this show is always first rate.The other strong point is the writing.  While these aren't mysteries, they do somehow keep you interested.  The dialogue is sharp, and you're never quite sure what Columbo is up to.  In a way, these are reverse mysteries.  Instead of wondering who did it, we find ourselves wondering how he'll solve it.  Rarely, are we disappointed.Columbo doesn't have car chases or gun fights or even harsh language.  And even the murders are usually implied violence.  It just has people standing around talking, engaging characters, relaxed (rarely dull) pacing.

Fans of Peter Falk's one-of-a-kind supersleuth should be pleased with this release of the landmark first episodes of this thirty-year television institution.One can delight in ""Prescription for Murder,"" the NBC TV-movie from the late 60's that introduced the world to the Italian-American gumshoe. Columbo was a bit abrasive in this first time out and he wasn't wearing his trademark, disheveled raincoat, but he still showed the deductive savvy that would endure throughout the series. The episode succeeds with great acting from Falk, Gene Barry, Justice, and acting luminary Nina Foch.Also, a jazzy Dave Grusin score helps move things along quite nicely.By the time of the second TV-movie, ""Ransom for a Dead Man,"" the character was dressed appropriately and was spouting that annoying, ""One more thing..."" that would become a show staple of the detective. It is appropriate that Lee Grant, one of the industry's trailblazers for women in film, would be cast as a crafty lawyer that kills her husband but must contend with the wily Columbo.It wasn't until the Steven Spielberg-directed first episode (""Murder by the Book"") of the series that viewers would find the Columbo that would be around for the next, and counting, three decades.""Death Lends a Hand"" features Robert Culp who would appear in three more Columbo's. It also has a unique camera trick involving Culp's character's glasses.""Lady in Waiting"" has Susan Clark and Richard Anderson as dysfunctional siblings with the former deciding that it's better to be an only child! The episode also stars Leslie Nielsen during his dramatic, second-tier leading man-days.There are numerous pleasures in the remaining episodes, many of them featuring the brilliant scoring of Billy Goldenberg, a Universal Studios landmark.Though extras would be nice, the wonders of Falk and company are enough to satisfy fans of a good who-dunit!",5,The evolution of a television legend,1095465600,"09 18, 2004",2004,1917,"['So', 'what', ""'re"", 'extras', 'Fans', 'Peter', 'Falk', 'one-of-a-kind', 'supersleuth', 'should', 'be', 'pleased', 'release', 'landmark', 'first', 'thirty-year', 'television', 'institution.One', 'can', 'delight', 'Prescription', 'Murder', 'NBC', 'TV-movie', 'late', '60', 'introduced', 'world', 'Italian-American', 'gumshoe', 'Columbo', 'was', 'bit', 'abrasive', 'first', 'time', 'out', 'was', ""n't"", 'wearing', 'trademark', 'disheveled', 'raincoat', 'still', 'showed', 'deductive', 'savvy', 'would', 'endure', 'series', 'episode', 'great', 'acting', 'Falk', 'Gene', 'Barry', 'Justice', 'acting', 'luminary', 'Nina', 'Foch.Also', 'jazzy', 'Dave', 'Grusin', 'score', 'move', 'things', 'quite', 'time', 'second', 'TV-movie', 'Ransom', 'Dead', 'Man', 'character', 'was', 'dressed', 'appropriately', 'was', 'spouting', 'annoying', 'One', 'more', 'thing', 'would', 'become', 'show', 'staple', 'detective', 'appropriate', 'Lee', 'Grant', 'one', 'industry', 'trailblazers', 'women', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'cast', 'crafty', 'lawyer', 'husband', 'must', 'contend', 'wily', 'Columbo.It', 'was', ""n't"", 'Steven', 'Spielberg-directed', 'first', 'episode', 'Murder', 'Book', 'series', 'viewers', 'would', 'find', 'Columbo', 'would', 'be', 'next', 'counting', 'three', 'decades', 'Death', 'Hand', 'Robert', 'Culp', 'who', 'would', 'appear', 'three', 'more', 'Columbo', 'also', 'unique', 'camera', 'trick', 'involving', 'Culp', 'character', 'glasses', 'Lady', 'Waiting', 'Susan', 'Clark', 'Richard', 'Anderson', 'dysfunctional', 'siblings', 'former', 'deciding', 'better', 'be', 'only', 'child', 'episode', 'also', 'Leslie', 'Nielsen', 'dramatic', 'second-tier', 'leading', 'man-days.There', 'are', 'numerous', 'pleasures', 'remaining', 'episodes', 'many', 'featuring', 'brilliant', 'scoring', 'Billy', 'Goldenberg', 'Universal', 'Studios', 'extras', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'wonders', 'Falk', 'company', 'are', 'enough', 'satisfy', 'fans', 'good', 'who-dunit']",Columbo: The Complete First Season

Then the whole show goes following Columbo with his questioning techniques and goofy behavior trying to prove who did it. I love other detectives, but Columbo has a special appeal for me maybe because for starters he does not look like a detective at all: his car, his clothes, his never seen wife--in the show per se...in the third season they included a pilot for Mrs. Columbo...but she was never seen in his show--and of course his adorable dog.

This is still the most intelligent detective show ever made, and Peter Falk is perfect for the role. This set includes 11 episodes, all of which are good, but some of which are the best of the series, with great guest stars like Robert Culp, Ray Milland, Eddie Albert, Suzanne Pleshette, Leslie Neilsen, and Roddy McDowall. One episode (""Murder by the Book"") is even directed by a very young Steven Spielberg.Of the bunch, I particularly enjoyed ""Short Fuse,"" ""Lady in Waiting,"" ""Ransom for a Dead Man,"" and Suitable for Framing."" Some actors who make guest appearances don't get the credit they deserve (like the excellent supporting performance in ""Short Fuse"" by William Windom, best known for his portrayal of a deranged starship Captain in ""The Doomsday Machine"" from the original ""Star Trek"" series.) Others, like Don Ameche in ""Suitable for Framing"" gets a guest starring nod despite the fact that he is killed by Ross Martin in the first thirty seconds of the episode.Of course the genius behind the series is the concept that most in the industry thought would not work: show the murder in the beginning and then watch how Columbo solves the case, instead of the tried and true television plot device of showing the result of the crime and making the audience wonder who did it until the end of the show. This sounds like it would be boring, but it is more cerebral because the viewers already know exactly how the crime was committed. This alone makes ""Columbo"" a masterstroke for intelligent television.Many reviewers have noted the lack of extras in this set. While that is correct, there are none, it makes no real difference to me: I would have enjoyed outtakes, commentary, etc., but the show stands on its own without any other requirements. This is a great set and I can't wait for the second season.",5,"Oh, Just One More Thing...",1100995200,"11 21, 2004",2004,1948,"['long', 'time', 'Columbophile', 'was', 'delighted', 'when', 'first', 'season', 'two', 'preproduction', 'shows', 'was', 'finally', 'released', 'DVD', 'still', 'most', 'intelligent', 'detective', 'show', 'ever', 'made', 'Peter', 'Falk', 'perfect', 'role', 'set', '11', 'episodes', 'are', 'good', 'are', 'best', 'series', 'great', 'guest', 'stars', 'Robert', 'Culp', 'Ray', 'Milland', 'Eddie', 'Albert', 'Suzanne', 'Pleshette', 'Leslie', 'Neilsen', 'Roddy', 'McDowall', 'One', 'episode', 'Murder', 'Book', 'even', 'directed', 'very', 'young', 'Steven', 'Spielberg.Of', 'bunch', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'Short', 'Fuse', 'Lady', 'Waiting', 'Ransom', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Suitable', 'Framing', 'actors', 'who', 'make', 'guest', 'appearances', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'credit', 'deserve', 'excellent', 'supporting', 'performance', 'Short', 'Fuse', 'William', 'Windom', 'best', 'known', 'portrayal', 'deranged', 'starship', 'Captain', 'Doomsday', 'Machine', 'original', 'Star', 'Trek', 'series', 'Others', 'Don', 'Ameche', 'Suitable', 'Framing', 'guest', 'starring', 'fact', 'killed', 'Ross', 'Martin', 'first', 'thirty', 'seconds', 'episode.Of', 'course', 'genius', 'series', 'concept', 'most', 'industry', 'thought', 'would', 'not', 'work', 'show', 'murder', 'beginning', 'then', 'watch', 'how', 'Columbo', 'case', 'instead', 'tried', 'true', 'television', 'plot', 'device', 'showing', 'result', 'crime', 'making', 'audience', 'wonder', 'who', 'did', 'end', 'show', 'would', 'be', 'boring', 'more', 'cerebral', 'viewers', 'already', 'know', 'exactly', 'how', 'crime', 'was', 'committed', 'alone', 'Columbo', 'masterstroke', 'intelligent', 'television.Many', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'lack', 'extras', 'set', 'correct', 'are', 'none', 'real', 'difference', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'outtakes', 'commentary', 'etc.', 'show', 'own', 'other', 'requirements', 'great', 'set', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'second', 'season']",Columbo: The Complete First Season

830524,AK7IDQJN31163,B0002COTDA,Ryan,"[6, 7]","There is little doubt that Columbo was something of a revolution in the world of detective fiction.  Nowhere will you find the clich&eacute; car chases, fistfights and gun battles that characterized so many other offerings in the genre.  Nowhere in Columbo's rumpled appearance, shy demeanor and apologetic manner will you find any trace of the hard-boiled, womanizing gumshoes that filled page and screen.  Nor would you find the classic whodunit that would leave the identity of the killer a mystery until the last second.  It's a wonder that the American public got so caught up in Columbo as they did, but the real gimmick that pulls the viewer is the subtle contest of cat-and-mouse between killer and cop that slowly builds throughout each episode.  What's more, some of Columbo's suspects get on to his game and he still manages to beat them in the end.  A perfect example of this is the pilot movie, ""Prescription: Death,"" in which a brilliant psychiatrist kills his wife and manipulates his mistress into helping him cover up the deed.  Columbo, of course, is on the case and his trademark, ""oh, just one more thing,"" tactics for disarming the doctor don't fool him for a second.  Yet, Columbo still manages to capture the killer through his own arrogance in the end.Other noteworthy episodes from the first season include the premier episode, ""Murder by the Book,"" in which one half of a mystery writing team kills the other using the perfect murder gimmick.  Also, ""Death Lends a Hand,"" in which a private eye kills his client's wife and is then hired by the client to help Columbo find the killer.  Also, ""Blueprint for Murder,"" in which an architect deliberately lets the police suspect him of killing his financial backer so he can hide the body right under Columbo's nose.Since this was a classic show from the '70's, the visual quality isn't always the greatest.  There are no glossy, computer generated graphics to help the show along.  Nor are there any powerful moral messages meant to expand the consciousness of the viewer.  Yet, none of that is needed when you have the solid performance of Peter Falk in the starring role, along with intelligent plotting and powerful music to aid in the storytelling.  This is as close to character-driven mystery as you're likely to get and it qualifies as good clean escapist fun.  The fact that there are no extras doesn't matter.

Columbo.  I particularly enjoyed the scene where he visits the paramour of Gene Barry's character and starts ranting that she's the weak link in the case and he will break her, even if he has to follow her every single day.  I wish there had been more of that behavior by Lt. Columbo because as time went on, he became way too nice and overly polite with the ""Yes, sirs.""  In fact, by the end of the series, he became a caricature of himself.  How many times did other police officers not know who Lt. Columbo was, only to mistake him for either a homeless man or a derelict trying to drive his car near the crime scene?  Don't get me wrong:  I love the Columbo series and from time to time re-watch it from Season One to the last boxed set.  And towards the end of the series, Peter Falk's wife (Shera Danese) appeared in too many episodes.  The woman can't act her way out of a paper bag, but as wife of the star and one of the executive producers, I'm sure it was a case of ""happy wife equals happy life"" and Peter Falk relented just to keep peace.The other episodes of Season One are stellar.

For those familiar with the cigar-smoking detective in the rumpled raincoat only through the specials produced in the 90s, the originial 1970s episodes show Columbo in his prime.Most people are familiar with the Columbo formula:  guest star plots murder; guest star kills victim (a series trademark - we know all along who the killer is); Columbo appears on scene; Columbo investigates - ""Ahh, just one more thing, maam/sir""; just as it looks like guest star will get away with it, Columbo discovers piece of evidence that seals the case; Columbo nails guest star with evidence; guest star is led away to jail.  A formula, yes, but a formula that worked incredibly well for over 40 episodes in its original run.The first season contains two of my favorites: ""Death Lends a Hand"" - Robert Culp plays a private investigator who kills a client's wife, then is hired by the unknowing client to help Columbo with the investigation; and ""Suitable for Framing"" - an art critic murders his uncle in order to obtain two priceless paintings...this episode has one of the best endings in the series.

830568,A3Q4XAQXKKV6V,B0002COTDA,William Smith,"[24, 25]","I love it when he says that, because it is always followed up by some miscalculation by the 'killer'. Well, I got into this show 'a bit late', like about 6 months ago...? I'm in my mid thirty's which is young enough to watch current programming but old enough to know current programming is, in general, unwatchable. So, what do we do? We reach back. This show happens to be on a current 'public-esque' TV channel and since I don't have cable, I take what I can get. Understand, I don't live by the mantra &#34;what's old is good&#34;, because there are plenty of shows I actually used to watch that just didn't age well; Land of the Lost (**.5) and the A-Team (**.5) come to mind.Enter Columbo.The Price*****: I'll admit it... I was standing in the store saying to myself, roughly forty dollars is a lot to spend on 7 episodes, and 2 mini movies/pilots. The minutes weren't really an issue but '7' seems a bit low when compared to other shows that have generally 24 eps. Well, having just viewed ONLY the Pilot: Prescription Murder, I feel as though I picked Universals pocket. This one ep. to me is worth what I paid for the set, heck it's better than most movies I own. Peter Falk hits the ground running, and even though the ep. does lag in places it is a truly remarkable piece of TV history.Format*****: The format of the show is intriguing. Each episode is 1.5 hours as opposed to 1 hour. The first 1/2 hour is generally dedicated to the `set-up` (guest stars), but this is crucial b/c not only is it quite a long time without Peter Faulk/Columbo, but it shows each show can stand up alone without the VERY worthy Peter Falk propping it up. Sure there are some clunkers, but not many I've seen. Anyway, once the murder is committed you really feel attached to the story because you've lived with these characters outside of the murder for awhile (well, 20-30 minutes)... anyway, Columbo gets there and starts making observations that doesn't exactly jibe with what was said, and slowly the screw turns... &#34;See..., that's what I don't understand...&#34; An `awe-shucks' Columbo says scratching his head, &#34;I thought you said...&#34; and from there the screws turn... tighter.Sound**: Why don't they take the time to go 5.1DD? I'm not going to rebuy this whole season in a few years like Star Trek. Thoughtful dialogue and characters do not NEED 5.1DD to be enjoyable so there is no reason to rebuy it, but why not just raise the price of the set somewhat to give us it right out of the gate?  The actual soundtrack is often brillant, however.Transfer***.5: Seems clear and clean. No complaints on a technical level, though I have only viewed the pilot.Packaging*****: The boxart is perfect. The strip of trench coat at the top is genius! Plus, when you open it, you are greeted with a great sense of Columbo; his dialogue. I do wish all the photos taken would have been Season One exclusively but I guess they went with variety. Some Mr. Falk is easily 10-15 years older. But the quality of the art is fantastic, maybe a disc or two could have had pics of the car to break up the concept of needing multiple aging pics?Conclusion*****: While I sit on the fence and wonder whether Baretta or SWAT are worth my time (VERY vague memories of these also), I can rest assured that they just might be worth it. It is possible for shows 'you weren't quite old enough' to watch to be treasures. Funny, if Columbo wasn't currently on TV I may have sat on the fence and 'wondered' about this release too. Columbo simply captures everything I view television for; great writing, great characters (starring and guest starring &#60;--which is rare), and geniune feeling. Somehow in my brain I know the show is 'scripted' and yet Columbo has such a great aire about him, you'd swear even if there wasn't a script, these very words would still roll out of his mouth. TV shows like Columbo are almost a mixed bag in a sense for DVD release because while they stand the test of time they at the same time make current televison a living, screaming, nightmare by comparison.Oh yea, I almost forgot...

830570,AP3B615GM191G,B0002COTDA,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[1, 2]","When most people remember this television show, I would bet that the first image that comes to mind is of a disheveled, seemingly lost detective who tricks villains into taking him lightly, then nabs them in the end in fantastic fashion.  For the most part, that is exactly how the episodes of ""Columbo"" transpired, but not entirely during the first season.During the pilot episode (""Prescription: Murder"") of the show, Columbo can be seen yelling (which would be completely out of character in later seasons) and furious with rage.  Though that part of the character was toned down in later episodes this first season, Season One still features a much more intense Columbo than any other.  Instead of seemingly tripping over his own feet for most of the episode, Columbo is more hard-charging, making it obvious that the villains were in deep trouble (whereas often in later seasons it would look like the villain would get away scot-free until the final scene).However, the only bad thing about a more intense Columbo is that it doesn't provide as much drama as his later appearances, as it is a little hard to believe that the villains can't see exactly what Columbo is trying to do to them.  That being said, though, the plots of the mysteries are still excellent in this first season, and the ways in which Columbo actually solves the crimes are some of the best of the entire show!Overall, if you buy this season expecting to see the bumbling, funny Columbo you remember, you may be surprised, as Columbo is much more intense than in any later episodes.  However, the quality of the episodes is not diminished by much, and many viewers feel that the quality of the murder schemes this season were some of the best of the entire show!",5,Still Finding The Right Formula,1220140800,"08 31, 2008",2008,1739,"['When', 'most', 'people', 'remember', 'television', 'show', 'would', 'bet', 'first', 'image', 'mind', 'disheveled', 'seemingly', 'lost', 'detective', 'who', 'villains', 'taking', 'lightly', 'then', 'end', 'fantastic', 'fashion', 'most', 'part', 'exactly', 'how', 'episodes', 'Columbo', 'transpired', 'not', 'entirely', 'first', 'season.During', 'pilot', 'episode', 'Prescription', 'Murder', 'show', 'Columbo', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'yelling', 'would', 'be', 'completely', 'character', 'later', 'seasons', 'furious', 'rage', 'part', 'character', 'was', 'toned', 'down', 'later', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'Season', 'One', 'still', 'much', 'more', 'intense', 'Columbo', 'other', 'Instead', 'seemingly', 'tripping', 'own', 'feet', 'most', 'episode', 'Columbo', 'more', 'hard-charging', 'making', 'obvious', 'villains', 'were', 'deep', 'trouble', 'whereas', 'often', 'later', 'seasons', 'would', 'look', 'villain', 'would', 'get', 'away', 'scot-free', 'final', 'scene', '.However', 'only', 'bad', 'thing', 'more', 'intense', 'Columbo', ""n't"", 'provide', 'much', 'drama', 'later', 'appearances', 'little', 'hard', 'believe', 'villains', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'exactly', 'what', 'Columbo', 'trying', 'do', 'being', 'said', 'plots', 'mysteries', 'are', 'still', 'excellent', 'first', 'season', 'ways', 'Columbo', 'actually', 'crimes', 'are', 'best', 'entire', 'show', 'Overall', 'buy', 'season', 'expecting', 'see', 'bumbling', 'funny', 'Columbo', 'remember', 'may', 'be', 'surprised', 'Columbo', 'much', 'more', 'intense', 'later', 'episodes', 'However', 'quality', 'episodes', 'not', 'diminished', 'much', 'many', 'viewers', 'feel', 'quality', 'murder', 'season', 'were', 'best', 'entire', 'show']",Columbo: The Complete First Season
