I have a universal DVD player so I can play Region 1 or 2 or whatever else may be out there. The story is a compelling tale about postulant raised in a Roman Catholic convent as an orphan who is on the cusp of taking her final vows. Shortly before her marriage to Christ, the Mother Superior calls her into her office for a conference to inform her that she has been contacted by the girl's heretofore unknown aunt and Mother Superior strongly suggests that she visit the aunt before taking her final vows. The postulant discovers that her Aunt was born into a family of the Jewish faith and her deceased parents were murdered by a farmer shortly before the arrival of the Nazis who were destined to murder them. He took over their farm and claims it as his own. In exchange for the girl (Ida) and her aunt's promise to not dispute the ownership of the farm he promises to show them where he buried the family's bodies.The acting and filming are simply magnificent and the experience of watching it as the aunt & Ida arrive at their destinations are haunting.

Other than the classical music from the screen...it seemed like everyone was either in shock or in prayer.  That was a phenomenon quite unexpected.Ostensibly, the film is about Ida (pronounced  Ee-da), a novitiate who is on the cusp of taking her Catholic vows in an isolated Polish monastery. Her Church name is Anna.  Her mother superior tells her (for the first time) that she has a relative, an aunt, and Ida must see her before she decides to commit her life to the Church.  Ida protests...why has this aunt not contacted her before, perhaps the notices did not reach her.  But she obeys and visits the older woman who was a sister to her unknown mother.The aunt is a communist prosecutor and magistrate who has seen it all.  Red Wanda she has been called - perhaps because she sent some persons to their death?  Why?  As enemies of the state.  We learn nothing else about the men or women whom she convicted. Initially, the aunt is reluctant to visit with her niece...and baits her with the statement - so you are a Jewish nun?  This revelation stuns the young girl.  Obviously, she has begun her journey to her aunt with no knowledge of the world and probably little knowledge of Jewishness.The two never warm to each other, except perhaps in one scene where the younger girl comforts the older woman.  They decide to set out on a quest to discover what happend to Ida's Jewish family and find their graves.  Whether Catholic or Jew, such a journey is of deep personal and spiritual significance.As the two go on their relentless journey, they learn Ida's parents and even Wanda's son were murdered during the Holocaust  The murderer confesses. They confront him - not with invictive..but with quiet disgust.  One of the most powerful scenes follows as the murderer climbs into the victim's graves that he had dug long ago.This film reminded me of a Dostoyevsky novel, where the entire film is is really about the interior lives of the two personalities in contact with long repressed emotions.  What does it mean to be Jewish to the individuals involved who have not lived Jewish lives.  What does it mean to be Jewish in a Polish society which has destroyed most of the people of that faith and feels no guilt.What struck me most about the film...more than the gorgeous black and white cinematography... is that this is a movie about silences.  And what those silences may mean.  There are no answers in the film...just the silences and the meaning each viewer gives to them.  Perhaps that explains the behavior of the audience that I remarked upon at the beginning of this review.The performances are subtle and sparse...but totally believable..  That's a quality I miss in films today...Polish director Pawel Pawliikowsky has renewed my faith in the future of moviemaking.",5,Two repressed souls - bursting in different directions.,1402185600,"06 8, 2014",2014,2900,"['movie', 'theater', 'when', 'film', 'ended', 'credits', 'rolled', 'forth', 'one', 'moved', 'seat', 'one', 'Other', 'classical', 'music', 'screen', 'seemed', 'everyone', 'was', 'either', 'shock', 'prayer', 'was', 'phenomenon', 'quite', 'unexpected.Ostensibly', 'film', 'Ida', 'pronounced', 'Ee-da', 'novitiate', 'who', 'cusp', 'taking', 'Catholic', 'vows', 'isolated', 'Polish', 'monastery', 'Church', 'name', 'Anna', 'mother', 'superior', 'first', 'time', 'relative', 'aunt', 'Ida', 'must', 'see', 'commit', 'life', 'Church', 'Ida', 'protests', 'why', 'aunt', 'not', 'contacted', 'perhaps', 'notices', 'did', 'not', 'reach', 'obeys', 'older', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'sister', 'unknown', 'mother.The', 'aunt', 'communist', 'prosecutor', 'magistrate', 'who', 'seen', 'Red', 'Wanda', 'been', 'called', 'perhaps', 'sent', 'persons', 'death', 'Why', 'enemies', 'state', 'learn', 'nothing', 'else', 'men', 'women', 'whom', 'convicted', 'Initially', 'aunt', 'reluctant', 'visit', 'niece', 'statement', 'are', 'Jewish', 'nun', 'revelation', 'young', 'girl', 'Obviously', 'begun', 'journey', 'aunt', 'knowledge', 'world', 'probably', 'little', 'knowledge', 'Jewishness.The', 'two', 'never', 'warm', 'other', 'perhaps', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'younger', 'girl', 'older', 'woman', 'decide', 'set', 'out', 'quest', 'discover', 'what', 'happend', 'Ida', 'Jewish', 'family', 'find', 'graves', 'Whether', 'Catholic', 'Jew', 'such', 'journey', 'deep', 'personal', 'spiritual', 'significance.As', 'two', 'go', 'relentless', 'journey', 'learn', 'Ida', 'parents', 'even', 'Wanda', 'son', 'were', 'murdered', 'Holocaust', 'murderer', 'confesses', 'confront', 'not', 'invictive..but', 'quiet', 'disgust', 'One', 'most', 'powerful', 'scenes', 'murderer', 'victim', 'graves', 'had', 'dug', 'long', 'ago.This', 'film', 'reminded', 'Dostoyevsky', 'novel', 'where', 'entire', 'film', 'really', 'interior', 'lives', 'two', 'personalities', 'contact', 'long', 'repressed', 'emotions', 'What', 'mean', 'be', 'Jewish', 'individuals', 'involved', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'lived', 'Jewish', 'lives', 'What', 'mean', 'be', 'Jewish', 'Polish', 'society', 'destroyed', 'most', 'people', 'faith', 'guilt.What', 'struck', 'most', 'film', 'more', 'gorgeous', 'black', 'white', 'cinematography', 'movie', 'silences', 'what', 'silences', 'may', 'mean', 'are', 'answers', 'film', 'just', 'silences', 'meaning', 'viewer', 'Perhaps', 'behavior', 'audience', 'remarked', 'upon', 'beginning', 'review.The', 'performances', 'are', 'subtle', 'sparse', 'totally', 'quality', 'miss', 'films', 'today', 'Polish', 'director', 'Pawel', 'Pawliikowsky', 'renewed', 'faith', 'future', 'moviemaking']",Ida (DVD)
489253,A10H47FMW8NHII,8379891716,"Jay B. Lane ""professional audience member""","[3, 4]","Poland submitted this award-winning drama (16 wins) to the 2014 Seattle International Film Festival about a young nun who, in 1960s Poland, suddenly suspends her decision to take her vows, because she has just uncovered a long-hidden family secret that dates back to WWII. The Mother Superior wisely advises her to visit her aunt in a nearby village before she takes her final vows.We watch:* Agata Trzebuchowska is Anna, the uninitiated young woman raised in a Catholic orphanage who has never been to the beach, never kissed a boy, and can't count her vows as a sacrifice if she doesn't know what she'll be missing.* Agata Kulesza is Wanda, our novitiate's Communist aunt, who breaks the news to her that she wasn't born a Catholic. Red Wanda is blunt and assertive in everything she does; she asks Anna, ""What if you find out there is no God?""* Dawid Ogrodnik plays Lis, a saxophone-playing hitchhiker who adores John Coltrane's ""Naima."" His family also suffered during the Holocaust because some of them were Gypsies. He's trying to avoid Army duty, so he observes that both of them are afraid to take vows. BTW do NOT miss him in ""Life Feels Good"" also from Poland!We explore Poland's collective guilt over the fate of three million Polish Jews who disappeared during the holocaust (their property was quietly confiscated by local families), while we watch a devout young woman question (and then answer) her concerns about becoming a Catholic nun.This effective PG-13 film is in black and white, so the expert use of light and shadow is obvious from the first frame. This is particularly effective in the nunnery.

489254,A14GK0E64J0WAS,8379891716,Paul Allaer,"[9, 9]","""Ida"" (2013 from Poland; 80 min.) brings the story of a young woman, Anna, who grew up as an orphan in a Polish convent. It's now the very early 60s and before she takes her final vows to become a nun, Mother Superior sends Anna out to meet her aunt Wanda, the only family member she has (but has never met). When Anna and Wanda meet up, Wanda tells her the truth: Anna was born Ida, a Jewish girl whose parents perished in WWII and she ended up as a very young girl at the convent. Wanda and Ida decide to go back to the Polish village where the family perished. Will they get the true story behind the death of Ida's family? Will Ida turn her back on the convent and Catholicism now that she's told she is Jewish? What will become of Wanda? To tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first, this is the latest movie from Polish writer-director Pawel Pawlikowski , who brought us the excellent ""My Summer of Love"" some 10 years ago. Here he brings yet another deeply moving story of a young woman, now Anna/Ida. Second, the movie is not only shot in black and white, but on top of that this is not a wide-screen movie (the aspect ratio is close to but not quite 1:1, very unusual). Third, there are several serious undertones, be they emotional, religious or otherwise, in this movie, The tension between Wanda, an alcoholic, non-practicing Jewish woman, and Ida, the shy yet curious Catholic-raised nun-to-be, is explored brilliantly in the movie. Then there is the issue of Jewish survivors of WWII, and the non-Jewish local population's tormented feelings about whether they did enough to help Jews in WWII. Fourth, the B&W; photography paints the Polish landscape as utterly bleak and yet beautiful at the same time. Last but not least, the lead performances are simply outstanding, mostly so of  Agata Trzebuchowska  in her big screen debut as Anna/Ida, but veteran actress Agata Kulesza as Wanda is equally superb.If it sounds like I am gushing about ""Ida"", it's because I simply love this movie, and sure to make my ""best of 2014"" list later this year. ""Ida"" premiered at last Fall's Toronto International Film Festival, to great critical acclaim. The movie finally opened at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati this weekend, and I went to see it right away. The late matinee screening I saw this at was PACKED, much to my surprise but delight. Yes! there is a demand out there for a challenging but deeply satisfying, top quality foreign movie like ""Ida"".

489255,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,8379891716,Turfseer,"[5, 9]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***'Ida' is Polish director Pawil Palikowski's latest contribution to the canon of Holocaust and post-Holocaust 'dramaturgy'. Lasting a brief 80 minutes, 'Ida' is shot in bleak black and white and has been likened to the style of the French New Wave and their iconic 'progenitor', Robert Bresson. The film has garnered one accolade after another and one has to search far and wide before digging up any significant critical commentary. Nonetheless, I will join those few who refuse to jump on the proverbial bandwagon, and praise this film as if it's the second coming of 'Grand Illusion'.Set in Soviet-controlled Poland in 1962, 'Ida' is the tale of Anna, a young woman who has lived in a convent all her life and on the verge of taking her vows as a nun. Before allowing her to prepare for the ordination, the mother superior informs Anna that she has a long-lost aunt and insists that she meet her. As a girl who's been sheltered all her life, it feels a bit odd that she would insist on Anna seeking out the aunt, in light of the fact that such a meeting could be traumatizing.Nonetheless, given the extraordinary nature of Anna's parentage, the mother superior perhaps believes that meeting the aunt would be the proper thing to do, vis-&agrave;-vis the Church. It turns out that Anna's birth name was Ida Lebenstein and she was the lone survivor of a Jewish family murdered during the Holocaust. This information is confided to her by her Aunt Wanda, who never revealed her identity to her niece, in all the years she was at the convent.The Ida plot concerns Ida's quest to learn the fate of her parents and their final resting place. The contrast between the idealistic Ida and cynical, jaded Wanda, couldn't have been put more succinctly put, when a sarcastic Wanda describes the difference between the two, to Anna: ""I'm the slut and you're the saint!""On the surface, Wanda appears to be a character we haven't seen before: a former state prosecutor, now working as a Judge in a post-Stalinist Poland, who also happens to be Jewish. But despite her semi-prominent position in the Communist party, nothing can help her feel better about herself. In addition to occasionally having indiscriminate dalliances with men, she also has a bad drinking problem. In one telling scene, she's arrested for drunk driving and pulls rank on the local police official who has been processing the arrest, threatening severe repercussions, which could lead to his dismissal (or perhaps something far worse).Wanda's self-destructive attitude is similar to the character Sol Nazerman, played by Rod Steiger in the 1965 Post-Holocaust drama, 'The Pawnbroker'. Both are 'damaged goods' as a result of their experiences during the Holocaust. Nazerman becomes a total misanthrope but Wanda expresses her contempt through her sarcasm. One reviewer (Dennis Schwartz) aptly describes 'The Pawnbroker' as ""an unpleasant, solemn and overwrought melodrama about an embittered Jewish Holocaust survivor."" This description can also be applied to Wanda. The problem with Palikowski's strategy here is that he wants credit for merely pointing out the OBVIOUS: the Holocaust was a terrible thing and in some cases, had immense, deleterious effects on the survivors. And Palikowski goes further by attempting to manipulate our emotions by having his one-note character (SUPER SPOILERS AHEAD), jump out the window (in effect, Palikowski can't resist 'hitting us over the head', by again stating the obvious: 'you see how bad it was for Holocaust survivors! She even jumped out the window!).Just as plenty of Jewish people will find this dour portrait of survivor guilt to be obvious (and perhaps heavy-handed), those of Polish heritage may feel equally short-changed. With any good melodrama, you cannot have a tragic victim without a sinister villain. The skimpy way, however, in which Palikowski references the Holocaust may play into a simplistic notion of collective responsibility for Polish anti-semitism during and after World War II. But there were indeed isolated acts of Polish people attempting to help Jews during the Nazi Occupation as well as many Polish victims themselves, at the hands of the Nazis.After searching for the father, Anna and Wanda discover that it was the son who murdered Anna's family. All we know that he's a villain who killed the family to take over the deed to the house. The narrative suffers from the development of a complex antagonist as we never really get to know much about the son or the rest of the family. Instead, the incident is used to simply explain Wanda's guilt (the revelation of how Wanda's son--who she gave to her sister--is murdered, is perhaps the last straw, that leads her to do herself in!) as well as raising another issue: Anna's decision to forgive her family's murderer (she agrees not to contest the claim to the property in exchange to finding out where her family is buried!).As for how Palikowski resolves Anna's issues can be interpreted in differing ways. I found it difficult to believe that Anna would suddenly give into her carnal desires given her sheltered upbringing. It makes for a good movie to have a love scene, but the odds that such an idealistic woman would suddenly 'come of age' (albeit so briefly), remains questionable. Does Anna's decision to return to her faith represent a triumph for her--a sticking to one's guns, so to speak? In my view, Palikowski wants us to view her return to the church as a second tragedy. Note how she so flippantly dismisses her lover's idyllic picture of the future. For Anna, marriage and family life can only lead to a mundane existence; so a return to cloistered life, now appears mandatory.'Ida' is replete with powerful visual images and raises important questions about faith, guilt and forgiveness. This is all at the expense of important character development as well as a tendency toward melodramatic excess. In short, I wanted more.",2,Few new revelations in Polish post-Holocaust melodrama as 'The Song of Bernadette' meets 'The Pawnbroker',1401926400,"06 5, 2014",2014,5971,"['***', 'review', 'may',
