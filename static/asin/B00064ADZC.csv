It still looks like crap. The picture looks terrible. The special effects are the worst I ever seen, if you want to call them special effects. Everything looks so fake. There isn't any reason to buy this movie. Save your money and your time. I got this for $4.99 at F.Y.E. on sale, and now I can see why. After I watched it, I immediately gave the movie to a friend who just got a blu-ray player, and is trying to start up his collection. He thanked me for the movie, but that was before he viewed it. No matter how cheap you see this movie for, don't buy it. It definitely wasn't worth the $4.99 I paid for it.

858768,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00064ADZC,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","Near Death (Joe Castro, 2004)The funniest scene in Near Death occurs slightly less than an hour into it. One of the characters has found a xeroxed photograph on the beach. It turns out to have been an autographed picture from 1947. Now, putting aside the fact the photocopiers didn't exist in 1947, it somehow didn't disintegrate after being in the sand for almost sixty years. This sort of attention to detail permeates the movie.Near Death is one of the most godawfully stupid movies I have ever seen. The acting is atrocious, the lighting is nonexistent, the gore effects are entirely unconvincing (blood in this movie looks like water dyed with red food coloring; no viscosity whatsoever), the direction is nonexistent. These are eighty-four minutes you will never get back. It gets half a star because it's not patently offensive, but trust me, this is not a movie you ever want to subject yourself to.

GOREHOUNDS, don't let the haters fool you, NEAR DEATH is what you're looking for."" Please! I am a gorehound, and with that being said: If you like good cheesy-gory horror movies, then stick with Dead Alive, Evil Dead 2, return of the living dead 2, Bad taste, and all movies that would fall into that category. This movie is a joke. Here is the breakdown: Bad acting. Very bad quality (meaning it looks like home video footage, you all know what I mean, porno quality if you will). Bad sound FX, Really bad special FX (we are talking cheap Halloween store gags and props) And let me cover the `gore' the other reviewer is referring to: Your talking about ghouls with black teeth (from food coloring) standing around in a circle, pretending to cannibalize a body. When they dip into the body for food, what your seeing is blood colored Jello in their hands. All they are doing is eating jello (no joke) Some of the actors in one scene can be caught spitting it back out, so they don't even digest any of it. Next gore: the jello affect is used a lot in the movie, and the first kill victim last a good portion of the movie, so their isn't a lot of gore here or victims. Other FX used are cheap blood and some `meal worms' (that you can buy at a pet shop) used to look like maggots.Summary: ITS BAD, and anyone that would give this 5 stars should be cannibalized themselves.

858771,A2CO0TBEGUZCZP,B00064ADZC,"Tom Goryssimo ""xploitation poet""","[4, 8]","In my opinion, if most viewers talk trash about NEAR DEATH, it's because they `re not GOREHOUNDS and B MOVIES lovers in the first place.I mean, if you know a little about that culture, you know what JOE CASTRO is up to and that's GREAT CHEESE. I've been following that guy's career since TERROR TOONS and so far, he has never disappointed me.First of all, when it comes to eye-popping GORE FX, he's simply one of the best. Everything he's related to delivers the goodies. From gutting to crushing, you got it all.  Flicks like BLEED, ZOMBIE CHRONICLES and even BLOOD FEAST II would not be the same without his contribution. Yeah... He uses mostly mannequins and real meat for his FX. So what ? It's effective at best and funny at worse, so it's alright to me.I also think he's brilliant as a director. From Comedy ( TERROR TOONS )to Drama ( JACKHAMMER MASSACRE ), he can add anything to his gory formula. He's always creative and daring. He also knows how to use his money : give him the last blockbuster's cappuccino's budget and he shoots a CULT flick in 2 days or less. I'm not kidding, the guy is that good. He got his own touch, naive and wicked at the same time and it's everything but boring. Maybe the production values are not always there but then again : if you can't stand Low budget HORROR flicks, maybe you should stick to Hollywood's major releases. But if you like your stuff bloody, dirty and sleazy, like I do, then JOE CASTRO is a dude you can trust.Now... About NEAR DEATH itself : it's a story of ghouls and ghosts. To be more precise, the plot is about three students of the paranormal who chase the spirit of a dead director into a big old house where strange and hostile people live. Enough said . You got cannibalism, dead, naked babes and of course : blood and guts. That's not it, since it Deals with ghosts of the 1940's, NEAR DEATH is more classical than previous JOE 's efforts in terms of setting and dressing. The house they use is great, spooky and weird and it adds a lot to the general atmosphere. The cast is almost the same than in BUTCHERED and MANIACAL, other great stuff that JOE CASTRO shot around the same time, and it's cool too.What more can I say ? GOREHOUNDS, don't let the haters fool you, NEAR DEATH is what you're looking for.And now a litle message to that sinister fool who pretends to be the master of HORROR... By comparing NEAR DEATH, a quikie shot in two days with no money, to ultimate classics like EVIL DEAD or BAD TASTE, who took years in the making and costed WAY more  money than this flick, you only prove one thing : you don't know what you're talking about.

858772,A2W82ICVTTYAOY,B00064ADZC,Zombob,"[0, 0]","Umm...ACTING: To say that the acting was atrocious would be a good thing. I think of the entire cast, one person could act and the rest were just horrible. Don't quite your day jobs, people.PRODUCTION: The lighting is bad, the special effects are bad, the direction and pacing of the film is bad, I just don't see how this movie was made. Maybe in the hands of a capable director with a strong acting cast, this movie could have over its budgetary limitations. I have seen movies made on a shoestring budget, that were 100 times better than this.ZOMBIES: Not your typical zombies that shamble, grunt and groan, these are able to function as people, but can not go out into the daylight. (Holy vampires, Batman!) Up until the end, I thought that they might possibly be cannibals, but the spectacular special effects finale (insert sarcasm) cleared that up. I guess they would be classified as functioning zombies.THE CAUSE: A movie director who lived in the home committed suicide after his maid spurned his advances and needs to be exorcised(?) from the house.NUDITY: Some breasts pop up here and there.FINAL: There is so very little that I can say I liked about this movie. Once the descent into badness began, I thought that possible it could be one of those ""so bad it's good"" movies. But, that surpassed that level quickly. It ended up being just a bad movie. While there were a few gore moments that fell into that ""so bad it's good"" column, (and I actually laughed out loud) there was nothing here to save this movie.
