I'd have to watch it twice to really figure out was going on because the story is so all over the place you just really have no idea whats going on.  Only thing is, it's so boring I couldn't even bother to watch it again.  Honestly, I was quite angry by the time the movie ended.

However, The characters and the set were the only good parts of this film.  As for the storyline, it is totally all over the place.  Whoever wrote this movie seemingly had a bunch of ideas and just threw them into one movie with no order or smooth transition from one scene to the next.  The movie jumps around too much and you have no idea why this scene is following that scene.  Totally unorganized and poorly written and directed.

While looking over the reviews, I wanted to add my two cents.CONSTELLATION is a great movie about family, loves and forgiveness.  Carmel Boxer, played by Gabrielle Union, narrates her life story.  She begins by telling you about a love she shared with a white soldier, Bear, during the time when it was clear that blacks and whites shouldn't mix.  As the film goes on you realize that the family is gathering to mourn the loss of Carmel and it's apparent that times have changed as her younger brother, Helms, played by Billy Dee Williams, was married to a white woman and their daughter married a white man.  While times have apparently changed, Helms and his daughter are both dealing with so much hurt from the past.  Will this family ever recover?CONSTELLATION has a wonderful cast and it's a movie that you can watch with the entire family.

It took me a while to know how and why the people were connected. It was a moving story of the family of Caramel Boxer. Her life, love, and hurt were presented in a sad, but tasteful fashion. I want to give this movie 3 and 1/2 stars because it was emotional, driven, and beautifully written, but the scenes were jumbled and not inspiring. I will have to watch it again, because I see that the director wanted the movie to be like a constellation. You may only see one star (person), but they are apart of the whole constellation (family). The quotes from this movie were amazing. I am going to add them to my facebook page.

1065279,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000OT6V0A,Roland E. Zwick,"[25, 25]","""Constellation,"" which begins in 1940's Alabama, tells the tale of a secret, forbidden love between a black woman named Carmel and a white soldier named Bear, whose romance is cut short when he is shipped overseas to fight in the war.  Flash forward fifty years to the funeral of Carmel - who never married after breaking up with Bear - which serves as the pretext for all the principal people in her life to gather together to air out their grievances and to thrash out the personal relationship problems that have haunted them all their lives.  The participants include her emotionally distant brother and his two ex-wives; her two adult nieces and their respective men folk; and Bear himself, who, despite the fact that the two of them were kept apart all their lives by the restrictions of a racist society, has decided to pay not only for the services, but to put all these people up in one of the swankier hotels in Huntsville, Alabama.Though there are a goodly number of insightful, touching moments in ""Constellation,"" the movie probably would have been more effective had the screenplay (by director Jordan Walker-Pearlman) not tried to cram so many different characters into such a relatively short space of time (the movie runs barely over an hour and a half).  Yes, I understand that the theme of the movie is all about how we form ""constellations"" with the people who are most important to us in life, but speaking strictly in narrative terms, much too often, the genuinely compelling travails of one character are shunted aside to make room for the far less interesting problems of another.  Moreover, the romantic relationship between Carmel and Bear, which is supposed to function as the emotional cornerstone of the movie, is never made all that convincing.  We are TOLD that these two people are in love with each other, but we aren't made to FEEL it.  In addition, Aunt Carmel is portrayed as such a wise and ethereal earth-mother presence even after death that she is essentially robbed of her own individuality and humanity as a character.Still, there is much that is good in the movie, starting with the performances of Billy Dee Williams, as a man incapable of making emotional connections with the people in his life, and Rae Dawn Chong, as the daughter who has the most trouble dealing with this reality.  They are ably abetted by Lesley Ann Warren, Zoe Saldana, Melissa De Souza, and Hill Harper.  The movie also boasts a flavorful soundtrack, filled with an eclectic mixture of musical styles, ranging from classical to hip hop to spiritual.  The Huntsville setting  also provides a refreshing change for audiences weary of seeing New York, Los Angeles and Chicago constantly being recycled in film after film, as if they were the only urban centers moviemakers had to choose from.The movie does lay its message on a bit thickly towards the end, employing heavy-handed speech-making and rather obvious symbolism to get its points across.  It really doesn't need to go to all that effort, since the viewers could probably figure the themes out on their own given half a chance.Yet, although ""Constellation"" is a decidedly mixed bag as far as family and social dramas go, it has enough elements of quality to make it worth checking out.",3,uneven but moving at times,1184457600,"07 15, 2007",2007,3261,"['Constellation', '1940', 'Alabama', 'tale', 'secret', 'forbidden', 'love', 'black', 'woman', 'named', 'Carmel', 'white', 'soldier', 'named', 'Bear', 'romance', 'cut', 'short', 'when', 'shipped', 'overseas', 'fight', 'war', 'Flash', 'forward', 'years', 'funeral', 'Carmel', 'who', 'never', 'married', 'breaking', 'up', 'Bear', 'pretext', 'principal', 'people', 'life', 'gather', 'together', 'air', 'out', 'grievances', 'thrash', 'out', 'personal', 'relationship', 'problems', 'have', 'haunted', 'lives', 'participants', 'include', 'emotionally', 'distant', 'brother', 'two', 'ex-wives', 'two', 'adult', 'nieces', 'respective', 'men', 'folk', 'Bear', 'who', 'fact', 'two', 'were', 'kept', 'apart', 'lives', 'restrictions', 'racist', 'society', 'decided', 'pay', 'not', 'only', 'services', 'put', 'people', 'up', 'one', 'swankier', 'hotels', 'Huntsville', 'Alabama.Though', 'are', 'goodly', 'number', 'insightful', 'touching', 'moments', 'Constellation', 'movie', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'effective', 'had', 'screenplay', 'director', 'Jordan', 'Walker-Pearlman', 'not', 'tried', 'cram', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'characters', 'relatively', 'short', 'space', 'time', 'movie', 'barely', 'hour', 'half', 'Yes', 'understand', 'theme', 'movie', 'how', 'form', 'constellations', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'most', 'important', 'life', 'speaking', 'strictly', 'narrative', 'terms', 'much', 'too', 'often', 'genuinely', 'compelling', 'travails', 'one', 'character', 'are', 'shunted', 'aside', 'make', 'room', 'far', 'less', 'interesting', 'problems', 'Moreover', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'Carmel', 'Bear', 'supposed', 'function', 'emotional', 'cornerstone', 'movie', 'never', 'made', 'convincing', 'are', 'TOLD', 'two', 'people', 'are', 'love', 'other', 'are', ""n't"", 'made', 'FEEL', 'addition', 'Aunt', 'Carmel', 'portrayed', 'such', 'wise', 'ethereal', 'earth-mother', 'presence', 'even', 'death', 'essentially', 'robbed', 'own', 'individuality', 'humanity', 'character.Still', 'much', 'good', 'movie', 'starting', 'performances', 'Billy', 'Dee', 'Williams', 'man', 'incapable', 'making', 'emotional', 'connections', 'people', 'life', 'Rae', 'Dawn', 'Chong', 'daughter', 'who', 'most', 'trouble', 'dealing', 'reality', 'are', 'ably', 'abetted', 'Lesley', 'Ann', 'Warren', 'Zoe', 'Saldana', 'Melissa', 'De', 'Souza', 'Hill', 'Harper', 'movie', 'also', 'flavorful', 'soundtrack', 'filled', 'eclectic', 'mixture', 'musical', 'styles', 'ranging', 'classical', 'hip', 'hop', 'spiritual', 'Huntsville', 'setting', 'also', 'refreshing', 'change', 'audiences', 'weary', 'seeing', 'New', 'York', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Chicago', 'constantly', 'being', 'recycled', 'film', 'film', 'were', 'only', 'urban', 'centers', 'moviemakers', 'had', 'choose', 'from.The', 'movie', 'lay', 'message', 'bit', 'thickly', 'end', 'employing', 'heavy-handed', 'speech-making', 'rather', 'obvious', 'symbolism', 'get', 'points', 'really', ""n't"", 'need', 'go', 'effort', 'viewers', 'could', 'probably', 'figure', 'themes', 'out', 'own', 'given', 'chance.Yet', 'Constellation', 'decidedly', 'mixed', 'bag', 'as', 'far', 'family', 'social', 'dramas', 'go', 'enough', 'elements', 'quality', 'make', 'worth', 'checking', 'out']",Constellation

It shows this place for what it is...a gorgeous, culturally diverse, upscale city.  The exterior shots show off my hometown wonderfully (and it all really looks like that, except we don't have a restaurant on the roof of the Times building).The setting and the eclectic soundtrack are the best things in it.There are some wonderful actors trying their best with almost no script that matters (although Billy Dee seems half-asleep a lot of the time).Every reaction shot is at least twice as long as it needs to be, and most scenes are, too. It's one very slow hour and a half.My favorite scene is when a stunned, disoriented Billy Dee wanders into Melvins BBQ Place. After one of the locals tries cheerily to figure out what he wants or where is trying to go,  and is met with stares and gibberish--the local man switches to deep concern: ""Can I give you a ride someplace, man?""  Its just so honest and deeply Southern.It's still a popular film on BET and women's drama networks, and I can see why.
