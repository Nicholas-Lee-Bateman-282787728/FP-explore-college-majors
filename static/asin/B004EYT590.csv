I liked the idea of exploring life after college, still carrying romantic baggage and considering marriage, but this is one seriously flawed movie, despite its strong cast.Katie Holmes arrives as the maid of honor for her friend's wedding. The problem is that Katie's character dated the groom for nearly five years, and those feelings between the two are still there. As the groom gets cold feet, quite literally by throwing himself in the nighttime ocean for a swim, the rest of the wedding party sets out to find him, but they are all such self-indulgent characters that they can do nothing but drink, do drugs, flirt adulterously, and--in Katie's case--actually betray her friend by sleeping with the groom. In a laughably bad line, she later tells the bride-to-be: ""He cheated on you,"" taking no responsibility for her own part in the betrayal.I wanted to care. I sat through the whole depressing, cliched, dysfunctional mess, and in the final minutes I couldn't think of one outcome that would be satisfying. None of them deserved each other, and in that way, they all deserved each other. When lightning shows up to disrupt the nuptials, I dreamed for a moment that everyone would be struck by it to end the movie. The actual ending wasn't much better.This is, without a doubt, a well-intentioned but horribly derailed wreck of a film. The attempt to explore romanticism has been much better done in other movies, such as ""The Mirror has Two Faces.""

I enjoy stream of conscious storytelling and ""The Romantics"" is very much that type of film. The cinematography adds to the story by being almost dreamlike in style. Not only are the characters intoxicated for a portion of the film, for Laura (Holmes), this night is almost like a dream- but in the worst sense. Her drama with Tom (Duhamel) is emotional and well wrought. I believed these characters' past and it's easy to understand their flaws and longings. I really did think that ""The Romantics"" is a neat little gem. In fact, I enjoyed the book as well, but in all actuality this story works better as a film. There is more of a punch to see the characters working things out visually rather than in your mind. I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys movies that take place in one day, movies that have unlikable but complex characters that you get to figure out, and to anyone who understands how messy life and love can be, and in the end, those two things are never, ever, what you expect them to be.",5,A challenging exercise in character study.,1297382400,"02 11, 2011",2011,1666,"['found', 'there', 'be', 'lot', 'like', 'Romantics', 'First', 'really', 'loved', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'film', 'stars', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'Josh', 'Duhamel', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'Adam', 'Brody', 'Malin', 'Akerman', 'Jeremy', 'Strong', 'Rebecca', 'Lawernce', 'Diana', 'Agron', 'Candice', 'Bergen', 'actors', 'were', 'working', 'top', 'form', 'exploring', 'generally', 'unlikable', 'characters', 'fullest', 'writing', 'tart', 'incisive', 'actors', 'plenty', 'work', 'interesting', 'observe', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'such', 'history', 'one', 'night', 'lives', 'storytelling', 'narrative', 'may', 'seen', 'rushed', 'incomplete', 'are', 'things', 'loved', 'enjoy', 'stream', 'conscious', 'storytelling', 'Romantics', 'very', 'much', 'type', 'film', 'cinematography', 'story', 'being', 'almost', 'dreamlike', 'style', 'Not', 'only', 'are', 'characters', 'intoxicated', 'portion', 'film', 'Laura', 'Holmes', 'night', 'almost', 'dream-', 'worst', 'sense', 'drama', 'Tom', 'Duhamel', 'emotional', 'well', 'wrought', 'believed', 'characters', 'past', 'easy', 'understand', 'flaws', 'longings', 'really', 'did', 'think', 'Romantics', 'neat', 'little', 'gem', 'fact', 'enjoyed', 'book', 'as', 'well', 'actuality', 'story', 'better', 'film', 'more', 'punch', 'see', 'characters', 'working', 'things', 'out', 'visually', 'rather', 'mind', 'would', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'movies', 'take', 'place', 'one', 'day', 'movies', 'have', 'unlikable', 'complex', 'characters', 'get', 'figure', 'out', 'anyone', 'who', 'how', 'messy', 'life', 'love', 'can', 'be', 'end', 'two', 'things', 'are', 'never', 'ever', 'what', 'expect', 'be']",The Romantics

Old college buddies reunite for a wedding in a beautiful old house and rehash their glory days gone by.  What could go wrong, right?  Pretty much everything.  From the beginning this movie is forced and tired.  The writing and directing is stiff and unoriginal.  Every trite movie technique is trotted out to pull at the viewer's emotional strings -  - drunken high jinx, skinny dipping, alchohol soaked tirades about ""selling"" out and becoming mediocre - (tired themes from the 60s that should stay in the 60s)!!The actors try to do their best with the script but even the venerable Anna Paquin falls short and just seems too brittle and narcissistic to believe.  I laughed out loud when Katie Holmes started quoting romantic poetry to her former lover -  via text no less -  in an attempt to seduce him and then when he finds her  - he finishes the poem - seriously??  For me, the only redeeming quality of this movie is actually Katie Holmes -  who for the most part does a nice job with the goofy lines and extremely poor blocking of the movie (I nearly got motion sickness watching her character argue with another while wandering around on the lawn outside in awkward patterns). The most interesting scene takes place near the very end when Katie's character confronts the bride (Anna Paquin)and a heated exchange takes place between the two - wish the movies had explored more of their story as it had some sparks!

My husband and  settled down to watch this last night and were very disappointed. The entire movie lacks credibility, the writing is awful and derivative, and cliches abound throughout. Even the so-called big names in the cast - Anna Paquin, Katie Holmes, and Josh Duhamel could not save this mess of a movie.The premise is nothing original - a group of college friends come together to attend the wedding of friends Lila (Paquin) and Tom (Duhamel). Trouble is the maid of honor, Laura (Holmes) used to date Tom back in college and still appears to have strong feelings for him. Predictably, trouble arises, and the movie plods along to its expected conclusion.The flaws in this movie are many so I'll just focus on some glaring aspects - there is no credibility in the supposedly close bonds between these 'friends'. From the beginning, viewers do not get a sense of the camaraderie between close pals who've spent their college years together. The interactions appear fake and stilted and very unnatural. There is no emotional connection between the characters whatsoever. Tom and Lila are supposed to be deeply in love, but there is a palpable lack of chemistry between these two. This may have been deliberate to show the underlying trouble in the relationship but it makes the whole idea of the wedding farcical.Then there's the performance of the three leads - Duhamel is ineffectual in his role as the conflicted Tom who can't seem to decide what or who he wants in his life and the quotes he spews from classic English poetry is so wooden it made me want to gag; Paquin is equally bad in her performance as the lovelorn Lila who seems oblivious to what is going on, she is so bent on marrying Tom that she appears to tolerate any transgressions which just does not make sense, her acting appears fake and lacks emotion; finally, Holmes as the tormented maid-of-honor Laura is perhaps the best of all three in terms of her performance, there are some good emotional scenes, but ultimately, the poor writing lets her down too. Oh, and Candice Bergen is totally wasted in the role of the bride's mom! She is given these awful cliched lines and is supposed to be the feared matriarch but her role too is forgettable.This was an utter waste of time - instead I would recommend watchingThe Big Chill (15th Anniversary Collector's Edition), or evenThe Great Gatsby!",2,"Bad writing, cliched, and lacks originality",1300579200,"03 20, 2011",2011,2483,"['picked', 'movie', 'rental', 'Anna', 'Paquin', ""'m"", 'fan', 'performance', 'True', 'Blood', 'HBO', 'series', 'husband', 'settled', 'down', 'watch', 'last', 'night', 'were', 'very', 'disappointed', 'entire', 'movie', 'credibility', 'writing', 'awful', 'derivative', 'cliches', 'abound', 'Even', 'so-called', 'big', 'names', 'cast', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'Josh', 'Duhamel', 'could', 'not', 'save', 'mess', 'movie.The', 'premise', 'nothing', 'original', 'group', 'college', 'friends', 'come', 'together', 'attend', 'wedding', 'friends', 'Lila', 'Paquin', 'Tom', 'Duhamel', 'Trouble', 'maid', 'honor', 'Laura', 'Holmes', 'used', 'date', 'Tom', 'back', 'college', 'still', 'have', 'strong', 'feelings', 'Predictably', 'trouble', 'arises', 'movie', 'plods', 'expected', 'conclusion.The', 'flaws', 'movie', 'are', 'many', 'so', ""'ll"", 'just', 'focus', 'glaring', 'aspects', 'credibility', 'supposedly', 'close', 'bonds', ""'friends"", 'beginning', 'viewers', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'sense', 'camaraderie', 'close', 'pals', 'who', ""'ve"", 'spent', 'college', 'years', 'together', 'interactions', 'appear', 'fake', 'stilted', 'very', 'unnatural', 'emotional', 'connection', 'characters', 'Tom', 'Lila', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'deeply', 'love', 'palpable', 'lack', 'chemistry', 'two', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'deliberate', 'show', 'underlying', 'trouble', 'relationship', 'whole', 'idea', 'wedding', 'farcical.Then', 'performance', 'three', 'Duhamel', 'ineffectual', 'role', 'conflicted', 'Tom', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'decide', 'what', 'who', 'life', 'quotes', 'classic', 'English', 'poetry', 'so', 'wooden', 'made', 'want', 'gag', 'Paquin', 'equally', 'bad', 'performance', 'lovelorn', 'Lila', 'who', 'oblivious', 'what', 'going', 'so', 'bent', 'marrying', 'Tom', 'tolerate', 'transgressions', 'just', 'not', 'make', 'sense', 'acting', 'fake', 'emotion', 'finally', 'Holmes', 'tormented', 'maid-of-honor', 'Laura', 'perhaps', 'best', 'three', 'terms', 'performance', 'are', 'good', 'emotional', 'scenes', 'ultimately', 'poor', 'writing', 'down', 'too', 'Oh', 'Candice', 'Bergen', 'totally', 'wasted', 'role', 'bride', 'mom', 'given', 'awful', 'cliched', 'lines', 'supposed', 'be', 'feared', 'matriarch', 'role', 'too', 'forgettable.This', 'was', 'utter', 'waste', 'time', 'instead', 'would', 'recommend', 'watchingThe', 'Big', 'Chill', '15th', 'Anniversary', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'evenThe', 'Great', 'Gatsby']",The Romantics
