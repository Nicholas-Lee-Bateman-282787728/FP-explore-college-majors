However, when I first saw promos for this series, I was a little skeptical.  The animation made it look like it would be a goofy kids series.  Boy, was I wrong.  This series has plenty of action which reminds me of the original 1980s Tranformers series.  Thank you for sending this out to me.",5,Transformers Animated Season 2,1237248000,"03 17, 2009",2009,340,"['have', 'been', 'Transformers', 'fan', 'many', 'years', 'However', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'promos', 'series', 'was', 'little', 'skeptical', 'animation', 'made', 'would', 'be', 'goofy', 'kids', 'series', 'Boy', 'was', 'wrong', 'series', 'plenty', 'action', 'original', '1980s', 'Tranformers', 'series', 'Thank', 'sending', 'out']",N/A

1198205,A3MAEE3YOIXWG7,B001GMH8XS,"K. deAntonio ""K. deAntonio""","[12, 15]","I really like Transformers, a lot! I was there at the dawn of the G1 Series, and have seen almost every other (Japanese) Transformer series that followed, including the very bad attempts at adapting a few of these series for the U.S. Though none of these series were on par with even the slowest/silliest G1 Episodes! Beast Wars, & Transformers: Armada were fun, for the most part and had some of the ""spirit"" of the G1 series, but weren't quite there. Now we have the newest series: Transformers Animated. I saw some of the early designs for the ""new"" versions of the classic characters at the San Diego ComicCon a few years ago, and thought that they might be a little too cartoony, but they still looked kind of cool. Although, I still cannot stand Optimus Prime with a mouth!!! Anyway, I started watching this series with my nephews, and found myself really enjoying the stories (simple as they are), and the animation as well. The first season is good, and the second season is a bit better. So, if you haven't watched any of this series, please give it a try. You might enjoy it more than you think you would!",5,Just give it a CHANCE!!!,1246060800,"06 27, 2009",2009,1115,"['really', 'Transformers', 'lot', 'was', 'there', 'dawn', 'G1', 'Series', 'have', 'seen', 'almost', 'other', 'Japanese', 'Transformer', 'series', 'followed', 'including', 'very', 'bad', 'attempts', 'adapting', 'few', 'series', 'U.S', 'none', 'series', 'were', 'par', 'even', 'slowest/silliest', 'G1', 'Episodes', 'Beast', 'Wars', 'Transformers', 'Armada', 'were', 'fun', 'most', 'part', 'had', 'spirit', 'G1', 'series', 'were', ""n't"", 'quite', 'there', 'Now', 'have', 'newest', 'series', 'Transformers', 'Animated', 'saw', 'early', 'designs', 'new', 'versions', 'classic', 'characters', 'San', 'Diego', 'ComicCon', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'thought', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'too', 'cartoony', 'still', 'looked', 'kind', 'cool', 'still', 'can', 'not', 'stand', 'Optimus', 'Prime', 'mouth', 'Anyway', 'started', 'watching', 'series', 'nephews', 'found', 'really', 'enjoying', 'stories', 'simple', 'are', 'animation', 'as', 'well', 'first', 'season', 'good', 'second', 'season', 'bit', 'better', 'So', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'series', 'please', 'give', 'try', 'might', 'enjoy', 'more', 'think', 'would']",N/A
