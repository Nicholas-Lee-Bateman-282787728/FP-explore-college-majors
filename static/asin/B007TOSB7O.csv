1537955,A3TJJYF5Y5593Z,B007TOSB7O,dancinhomer,"[0, 0]","First and foremost, be cautioned that although this movie is about the struggles of a person with Down's Syndrome, this is NOT a feel-good Hallmark movie... not by a long shot.  This movie is a stark, gripping tale of a mentally challenged person trying to navigate his way in his rural community.What I found so refreshing about this film is that it is utterly devoid of cliches.  Everyone tries to cut the protagonist some slack, but some have a lot less patience than others.  These characters aren't stellar people.  They are heavily flawed.  They just recognize that the protagonist is who he is.  None of them want to be seen as the person who was cruel to the guy with Down's.  They may do terrible things, including not-so-nice things to the protagonist, but nearly everyone puts  forth the effort not to be upsetting to the guy (with varying degrees of success) and that's dang refreshing (and much more realistic in this day and age).The performances are jaw-dropping.  I didn't see a single player who wasn't thoroughly convincing in his/her role, particularly Shannon Woodward, who shows a range I never suspected she had (although I do enjoy her in the *Raising Hope* sitcom), Jackson Rathbone (who, in any other movie, would easily steal every scene he was in) and Evan Sneider, who puts forth an amazing performance.In short, this movie is engrossing.  It's not a &#34;triumphant tale of the human spirit,&#34; but that's what makes it one of the best movies about Down's Syndrome ever. There is profanity and a lot of sexual situations, but anyone who doesn't automatically decline a movie based on that should see this film.

1537957,AYG1U47VFZ165,B007TOSB7O,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[7, 11]","It's very difficult to discuss my full impressions on GIRLFRIEND without a few spoilers, but I'll give it my critical best.  At least, I'll try to contain any spoilers to points that either (A) I think are relevant for discussion or (B) I think are entirely predictable given the obvious narrative of the story.  In Evan's world - Evan being the lead character - he's only given one sympathetic supporter: his mother Celeste (played by the usually reliable Amanda Plummer is, sadly, killed off with absolutely no background or protracted explanation - the saddest of plot contrivances in the entire flick).  She's there one minute, and, fifteen minutes later, she's dead.  Also, if you've seen the preview (I strongly encourage you to avoid it if you haven't), then you've practically seen the film - certainly, you've seen most critical thematic elements - another tremendous disservice to a motion picture thanks to idiotic studio marketers.Our story: Evan (played by newcomer Evan Sneider, a sufferer of Downs Syndrome) finds himself parentless and virtually abandoned by the rest of his family.  Desperate for companionship, he acts on his long-suppressed attraction to local skank, Candy (convincingly played by Shannon Woodward), only to find himself in the middle of a dangerous triangle with her and her destructive somewhat-ex-boyfriend, Russ (Jackson Rathbone).  Used by all parties for their various selfish motivations, Evan winds up being little more than a victim of constant deception, abuse, and exploitation ... one could argue even at the hands of a young writer/director.There are many things I found frustrating about GIRLFRIEND but the most egregious was the way writer/director Justin Lerner constructed this world (Evan's understandably given almost `angelic' status for the purposes of this story).  Everyone - and I mean EVERYONE - is entirely bankrupt morally.  Evan's few moments of goodness and mercy are those few provided by his mother.  Alas, fifteen minutes in, she's dead and gone.  Those around him - including family - won't take his telephone calls, and they instead feel they can just give the young man money (buying his `independence') and allow him to fend for himself.  The other townfolk apparently have no positive regard for Evan, as they're only shown making fun or belittling him or getting him drunk.  Even his perceived ""girlfriend"" essentially uses Evan for the personal and financial assistance he gives her; in her final character beat, she basically ""prostitutes"" herself in some act of `redemption' (???), despite the fact that she has no measureable feelings or attachments to him.  Candy is a one-note creation - all she can do is make one bad decision after another - and, like so much of the film, she doesn't seem entirely legitimate.  Did she really believe what she was doing with Evan was the `humane' thing to do?  The `proper' thing to do?  Or was all of that just the machinations of an ambitious writer/director trying to force some bizarre definition of poignancy onto all of this?  Unfortunatley, it's never entirely clear - GIRLFRIEND is not about answers - though I'll admit Candy's last poor decision is marginally handled with some care to those involved.That may be the single greatest point of contention between my take on Lerner's story and the other reviewers you may seek out; there's hardly a shred of human decency in any of this.  However, in the advertising materials associated with the DVD release, even Lerner states: ""In writing the actual script, my most important goal was to create a destitute, morally bankrupt world, full of characters that were deceitful, violent, dishonest, and selfish and, in turn, drop into this world a character, Evan, who was the human personification of unconditional love and forgiveness.""  On that point, I think Lerner has succeeded BUT the problem I have with that is that, by definition, Lerner's tale implies that only special persons - those burdened by Downs Syndrome - are capable of delivering unconditional love AND forgiveness, and that's something I found horrifically flawed.  It's a canard, much like much of what accounts for this story and characterizations.Now, for the record, Evan Sneider is a tremendously talented actor.  So is Shannon Woodward.  And, as I've said, Amanda Plummer is utterly wasted as a plot device.  In particular, Sneider embodies Evan with equal parts strength and frailty.  I certainly wish he had been given a far more realistic world to exist in than the exploitative one depicted by the next Hollywood `wunderkind.'  This story - or relevant aspects of it - have been done elsewhere and with much greater pragmatism.  In his novice hands, GIRLFRIEND becomes an intellectual pursuit where reality rings hollow.GIRLFRIEND is produced by Wayne / Lauren Film Company and Patchmo Entertainment.  DVD distribution is being handled through Strand Releasing.  The cinematography is particularly impressive - excellent shooting locations lit and photographed with great care - and the audio is exceptional for a basic human drama.  The disc comes packed with a nice assortment of special features including a behind-the-scenes feature on the making of the film as well as the scoring of it, and there's also a BBC interview with the writer/director Justin Lerner.RECOMMENDED mostly on the grounds that it's technically a very well accomplished film, and it should spur some deep conversation over the way special persons are treated privately and socially.  Otherwise, I found much of GIRLFRIEND to be a curious disappointment; rarely have I seen so many self-absorbed people in a small town chucked into the same film.  (Hollywood often tends to misrepresent the masses at large, and, in that regard, GIRLFRIEND pulls no punches.)  However, for a far more compassionate approach to the same subject and perhaps to even balance out the debate, I'm encourage pairing GIRLFRIEND as a double bill with OCEAN HEAVEN; it stars Jet Li (yes, THAT Jet Li, but it's a family drama, not chopsockey!) and explores similar themes in an entirely different way.  GIRLFRIEND is definitely worth the time, even if it frustrates you as much as it did me.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the good folks at Strand Releasing provided me with a DVD screener copy of GIRLFRIEND by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",3,"Evan Could've Used A Better Friend, Especially One In Writer/Director Lerner",1343692800,"07 31,

1537959,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B007TOSB7O,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[10, 10]","I approached the indie ""Girlfriend"" with some trepidation.  As the central protagonist is a young man with Down Syndrome, I was worried that the movie might be overly sentimental or would strain for uplift as sometimes these well meaning endeavors attempt.  I was pleasantly surprised, therefore, that this was NOT a movie about Down Syndrome.  Instead, it happens to be a film in which the lead character is living with Down.  And even more refreshing, he's flawed and frustrating and embodies a three dimensional character with foibles, poor judgement, and the expected complexities of a young man struggling toward adulthood.  In his first full length feature, writer/director Justin Lerner has established a movie that feels simultaneously real and offbeat.  And while I wasn't entirely convinced throughout the plot, the characters felt so grounded that I was swept up in this unusual tale.""Girlfriend"" introduces us to Evan (Evan Sneider, who is Down in real life) who shares a comfortable rural existence with his mother (the great Amanda Plummer.  Where has she gone?  Why don't we see her more often?).  Evan is a sociable enough individual who yearns for normalcy.  He works in the restaurant industry with this mom, he tries to keep up with high school friends, he crushes on a girl (Raising Hope's Shannon Woodward) and gets caught up in the drama, intrigue, and romance of his favorite TV programs.  More than anything, though, he just wants to have a girl by his side and his sights are set on Woodward.  Things take a turn when Evan is left on his own, and he attempts to get closer to his dream girl by rescuing her from dire financial straits.  This squarely gets him caught up in a complicated domestic situation that also involves her former flame (Jackson Rathbone) and her young son.  The screenplay isn't, at time, afraid to make Evan unlikable which is much to its credit.  Just who, if anyone, is taking advantage of whom?  Some might describe this as a gentle love story (and in its way, it is) but I was far more intrigued by the weightier moral decisions its characters faced.Sneider does well in a challenging role.  Woodward is solid enough, and Rathbone is charmingly unhinged.  I really thought this movie was exceedingly well acted and involving.  Sometimes, however, the situations strained credibility.  I won't reveal any spoilers, I'll just say that I never fully bought Evan's financial independence (which was established rather haphazardly with a convenient wad of cash).  The movie, after being so good, doesn't seem to know how to end as well.  A sudden and inexplicable accident feels both rushed and tacked on.  Seriously, I was so engrossed that I thought I was going to give the movie my highest recommendation.  But these stumbles, especially at the end, disappointed me more than I'd like to admit.  Still, though, I wholeheartedly recommend ""Girlfriend.""  It's not a movie I feel like I've seen a dozen times before and this originality goes a long way with me.  I look forward to Lerner's next project.
