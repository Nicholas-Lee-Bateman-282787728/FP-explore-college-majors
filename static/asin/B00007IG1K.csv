729238,A23NJ9AMXSVC6D,B00007IG1K,BerraH,"[2, 3]","I would not recommend this 4-Film Collection.We love the Andy Griffith Show and all of the characters from Mayberry! It is a &#34;good&#34; wholesome family show that we can watch without the worry of improper innuendos and suggestive comments that you get with so many other shows! So when we saw that there were other movies that Andy Griffith played in, we were very excited and ordered several of them. I guess we just had the perception that Andy Griffith would have the same values and similar characteristics in all of his movies as he did in his role as Andy Taylor. However, we were disappointed when we found out that he plays roles of people with quite different characteristics in other movies. The roles that he plays in other movies includes characteristics of self-centeredness, pride, arrogance, loud-mouthed, vagrant and a rebel. All of these are basically quite the opposite characteristics of the image that we had developed of Andy Griffith.With that in mind, here is my review of the 4 films included in this DVD:1.) &#34;A Song For The Season&#34; - The only reason I even gave this 4-Film Collection 3 stars is because off this movie! If it wasn't for this movie, it would have been a total waste of our money!This movie is a VERY good family Christmas movie! We loved it and it was worth getting just for this one movie!! Definitely would recommend this movie to anyone that enjoys watching a good &#34;family&#34; oriented Christmas movie. Andy Griffith is much older in this movie and he doesn't have the leading role. But it is still good an excellent movie and would highly recommend it.2.) &#34;Daddy & Them&#34; - TERRIBLE!!!!! I guess I really cant say that it was terrible because I have no idea what it was even about because I only watched about the first 2 minutes of it and then had to shut it off. I just could not believe my ears! In that short time there was a guy (not Andy Griffith) and gal that was talking about sex and had used the &#34;F&#34; word several times along with other inappropriate things. I just shut it off. What a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT! I have no idea what role Andy played in this movie since I shut it off but I just cant hardly believe that Andy Griffith would even play in a movie like this one!3.) &#34;Pray For The Wildcats&#34; - Another disappointment but at least I did watch this one. Andy plays the role of a rich man that is very conceited and wants everyone to do things &#34;his&#34; way! He tries to pick up a girl and ends up getting into a brawl with her boyfriend but is stopped by a friend of his (William Shatner). Then later they come across the girl and her boyfriend swimming in the ocean in the nude. Later Andy decides that he is going to get revenge so he goes back to where they were along with one of his friends. Andy refers to them as Hippies and tries to &#34;buy off&#34; the guy with money so that he will leave and let Andy have the girl. But the boyfriend declines Andy's proposal. Then Andy sabotages their van so the couple will be left stranded in the desert. They both end up dieing and Andy expects his friend to keep quite about what happened. I guess this movie was OK but wouldn't really recommend it.4.) &#34;Street Killing&#34; - If you like Matlock you will probably like this movie. But instead of him being a high priced lawyer, he works for the DA and is trying to get a conviction against a well known crime &#34;king&#34;. It was OK and I kind of liked it and I guess I would probably recommend this one for someone that enjoys this type of movieAs you can see, the only movie on this 4-Film Collection that we really enjoyed was &#34;A Song For The Season&#34;. So if I had it to do over, my recommendation would be to not buy this 4 Film Collection and just look for the individual movies and only buy &#34;A Song For The Season&#34;.",3,Not what expected!,1387756800,"12 23, 2013",2013,3844,"['would', 'not', 'recommend', '4-Film', 'Collection.We', 'love', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'Show', 'characters', 'Mayberry', '34', 'good', '34', 'wholesome', 'family', 'show', 'can', 'watch', 'worry', 'improper', 'innuendos', 'suggestive', 'comments', 'get', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'shows', 'So', 'when', 'saw', 'were', 'other', 'movies', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'played', 'were', 'very', 'excited', 'ordered', 'several', 'guess', 'just', 'had', 'perception', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'would', 'have', 'same', 'values', 'similar', 'characteristics', 'movies', 'did', 'role', 'Andy', 'Taylor', 'However', 'were', 'disappointed', 'when', 'found', 'out', 'roles', 'people', 'quite', 'different', 'characteristics', 'other', 'movies', 'roles', 'other', 'movies', 'characteristics', 'self-centeredness', 'pride', 'arrogance', 'loud-mouthed', 'vagrant', 'rebel', 'are', 'basically', 'quite', 'opposite', 'characteristics', 'image', 'had', 'developed', 'Andy', 'Griffith.With', 'mind', 'here', 'review', '4', 'films', 'included', 'DVD:1', '34', 'A', 'Song', 'Season', '34', 'only', 'reason', 'even', 'gave', '4-Film', 'Collection', '3', 'stars', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'total', 'waste', 'money', 'movie', 'VERY', 'good', 'family', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'loved', 'was', 'worth', 'getting', 'just', 'one', 'movie', 'Definitely', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'watching', 'good', '34', 'family', '34', 'oriented', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'much', 'older', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'leading', 'role', 'still', 'good', 'excellent', 'movie', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'it.2', '34', 'Daddy', 'Them', '34', 'TERRIBLE', 'guess', 'really', 'cant', 'say', 'was', 'terrible', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'even', 'only', 'watched', 'first', '2', 'minutes', 'then', 'had', 'shut', 'off', 'just', 'could', 'not', 'believe', 'ears', 'short', 'time', 'was', 'guy', 'not', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'was', 'talking', 'sex', 'had', 'used', '34', 'F', '34', 'word', 'several', 'times', 'other', 'inappropriate', 'things', 'just', 'shut', 'off', 'What', 'HUGE', 'DISAPPOINTMENT', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'role', 'Andy', 'played', 'movie', 'shut', 'off', 'just', 'cant', 'hardly', 'believe', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'would', 'even', 'play', 'movie', 'one', '3', '34', 'Pray', 'Wildcats', '34', 'disappointment', 'least', 'did', 'watch', 'one', 'Andy', 'role', 'rich', 'man', 'very', 'conceited', 'everyone', 'do', 'things', '34', '34', 'way', 'pick', 'up', 'girl', 'up', 'getting', 'brawl', 'boyfriend', 'stopped', 'friend', 'William', 'Shatner', 'Then', 'later', 'come', 'girl', 'boyfriend', 'swimming', 'ocean', 'nude', 'Later', 'Andy', 'going', 'get', 'revenge', 'so', 'back', 'where', 'were', 'along', 'one', 'friends', 'Andy', 'refers', 'Hippies', 'tries', '34', 'buy', 'off', '34', 'guy', 'money', 'so', 'will', 'leave', 'let', 'Andy', 'have', 'girl', 'boyfriend', 'Andy', 'proposal', 'Then', 'Andy', 'van', 'couple', 'will', 'be', 'left', 'stranded', 'desert', 'end', 'up', 'dieing', 'Andy', 'friend', 'keep', 'quite', 'what', 'happened', 'guess', 'movie', 'was', 'OK', 'would', ""n't"", 'really', 'recommend', 'it.4', '34', 'Street', 'Killing', '34', 'like', 'Matlock', 'will', 'probably', 'movie', 'instead', 'being', 'high', 'priced', 'lawyer', 'DA', 'trying', 'get', 'conviction', 'well', 'known', 'crime', '34', 'king', '34', 'was', 'OK', 'kind', 'liked', 'guess', 'would', 'probably', 'recommend', 'one', 'someone', 'type', 'movieAs', 'can', 'see', 'only', 'movie', '4-Film', 'Collection', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'was', '34', 'A', 'Song', 'Season', '34', 'had', 'do', 'over', 'recommendation', 'would', 'be', 'not', 'buy', '4', 'Film', 'Collection', 'just', 'look', 'individual', 'movies', 'only', 'buy', '34', 'A', 'Song', 'Season', '34']",N/A

729244,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B00007IG1K,Wuchak,"[0, 0]","&#34;Pray for the Wildcats&#34; is a TV &#34;movie of the week&#34; from 1974 about four businessmen (Andy Griffith, William Shatner, Robert Reed and Marjoe Gortner) who take a trip through the desert wilderness of Baja California on dirt bikes. Griffith plays Sam Farragut, an arrogant mogul who thinks money is power and anyone can be bought if the price is right; and, if they can't, well, they'll just have to be discarded one way or another. Needless to say, the trip doesn't go as pleasantly as planned.If you didn't think it was possible for Griffith to play a robust villain you need to see this film. Andy just eats up the role of the dastardly Farragut. Not only is his performance a pleasure to behold, it rings true! All the other actors are perfectly cast, as are the wives and girlfriend of the three subordinate bikers, Lorraine Gary, Angie Dickinson and Janet Margolin respectively.&#34;Pray for the Wildcats&#34; is a morality tale in the manner of &#34;Deliverance,&#34; except that the crime is inverted and the trip takes place in the SW desert/coast rather than a wild river in Georgia. Although a TV movie, &#34;Pray for the Wildcats&#34; is every bit as good as &#34;Deliverance&#34; and perhaps even better. And, thankfully, it doesn't contain anything as hard to watch as that infamous &#34;squeal like a pig&#34; scene.Judging from the reviews, many will ridicule such statements. In fact, for reasons that elude me &#34;Pray for the Wildcats&#34; is often mocked as &#34;campy&#34; and &#34;unintentionally funny.&#34; Really? I don't see this at all; and anyone who thinks it's campy obviously doesn't know what camp is. This is clearly a serious drama/adventure/thriller with the requisite soap operatics, but nothing overkill and definitely within the realm of believability. Another overdone criticism is Shatner's hairpiece, which is odd since it definitely LOOKS like his natural hair (not that it is).The real reason reviewers make fun of &#34;Pray for the Wildcats&#34; is because (1.) it's a TV movie and (2.) three of the stars had well-known TV shows -- The Andy Griffith Show, Star Trek and The Brady Bunch -- and, gee, I guess there's no way they could really act and break away from their typecast roles. But they can and do superbly in &#34;Pray for the Wildcats.&#34;Another thing I love about this film is the powerful message: ***SPOILER ALERT*** One man sins greatly, but has zero remorse and tries to cover it up through his power and money; another man also sins, but realizes his mistake and ultimately proves his character; the other two show that they believe money and position are more important than justice and therefore prove their lack of character. ***END SPOILER***The film was shot in Arizona and Baja California and runs 100 minutes.GRADE: A+For reviews of the other three films see the other reviews.",5,"Worth it just for ""Pray for the Wildcats""",1404777600,"07 8, 2014",2014,2862,"['34', 'Pray', 'Wildcats', '34', 'TV', '34', 'movie', 'week', '34', '1974', 'four', 'businessmen', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'William', 'Shatner', 'Robert', 'Reed', 'Marjoe', 'Gortner', 'who', 'take', 'trip', 'desert', 'wilderness', 'Baja', 'California', 'dirt', 'bikes', 'Griffith', 'Sam', 'Farragut', 'arrogant', 'mogul', 'who', 'money', 'power', 'anyone', 'can', 'be', 'bought', 'price', 'right', 'ca', ""n't"", 'well', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'be', 'discarded', 'one', 'way', 'Needless', 'say', 'trip', ""n't"", 'go', 'as', 'pleasantly', 'planned.If', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'possible', 'Griffith', 'play', 'robust', 'villain', 'need', 'see', 'film', 'Andy', 'just', 'up', 'role', 'dastardly', 'Farragut', 'Not', 'only', 'performance', 'pleasure', 'behold', 'true', 'other', 'actors', 'are', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'are', 'wives', 'girlfriend', 'three', 'subordinate', 'bikers', 'Lorraine', 'Gary', 'Angie', 'Dickinson', 'Janet', 'Margolin', 'respectively.', '34', 'Pray', 'Wildcats', '34', 'morality', 'tale', 'manner', '34', 'Deliverance', '34', 'crime', 'inverted', 'trip', 'place', 'SW', 'desert/coast', 'rather', 'wild', 'river', 'Georgia', 'TV', 'movie', '34', 'Pray', 'Wildcats', '34', 'bit', 'as', 'good', '34', 'Deliverance', '34', 'perhaps', 'even', 'better', 'thankfully', ""n't"", 'contain', 'anything', 'as', 'hard', 'watch', 'infamous', '34', 'squeal', 'pig', '34', 'scene.Judging', 'reviews', 'many', 'will', 'ridicule', 'such', 'statements', 'fact', 'reasons', 'elude', '34', 'Pray', 'Wildcats', '34', 'often', 'mocked', '34', 'campy', '34', '34', 'unintentionally', 'funny.', '34', 'Really', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'anyone', 'who', 'campy', 'obviously', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'camp', 'clearly', 'serious', 'drama/adventure/thriller', 'requisite', 'soap', 'operatics', 'nothing', 'overkill', 'definitely', 'realm', 'believability', 'overdone', 'criticism', 'Shatner', 'hairpiece', 'odd', 'definitely', 'natural', 'hair', 'not', '.The', 'real', 'reason', 'reviewers', 'make', 'fun', '34', 'Pray', 'Wildcats', '34', '1', 'TV', 'movie', '2', 'three', 'stars', 'had', 'well-known', 'TV', 'shows', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'Show', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'gee', 'guess', 'way', 'could', 'really', 'act', 'break', 'away', 'typecast', 'roles', 'can', 'do', 'superbly', '34', 'Pray', 'Wildcats.', '34', 'thing', 'love', 'film', 'powerful', 'message', '***SPOILER', 'ALERT***', 'One', 'man', 'greatly', 'zero', 'remorse', 'tries', 'cover', 'up', 'power', 'money', 'man', 'also', 'mistake', 'ultimately', 'character', 'other', 'two', 'show', 'believe', 'money', 'position', 'are', 'more', 'important', 'justice', 'therefore', 'prove', 'lack', 'character', '***END', 'SPOILER***The', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'Arizona', 'Baja', 'California', '100', 'minutes.GRADE', 'A+For', 'reviews', 'other', 'three', 'films', 'see', 'other', 'reviews']",N/A
