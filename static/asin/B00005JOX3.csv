But it is being called both. (For an example of smart satire, see ""Thank You for Smoking"".) Laughs here are mostly dutiful or nervous. This reminded me of something between amateurish college skits, all dressed up with Hollywood production values and way-overdone make-up, and ""Saturday Night Live"" with too much time on its hands, cobbled together with an uneasy terrorist plot twist. Written and directed by Paul Weitz, director of ""American Pie"" and ""About a Boy"", this movie's reach exceeds its grasp: aiming for the ""About a Boy"" audience, it hits ""American Pie"" humor, if it hits, instead.It's simply too easy to lampoon George W. Bush (overplayed by Dennis Quaid as a ventriloquist's dummy) for too many things, and it's been done. Marcia Gaye Hardin plays a very respectable Laura Bush clone. A sly casting touch is having Willem Dafoe eerily made up as a cross between Dick Chaney and Donald Rumsfield, being the puppeteer and the ventriloquist behind the President. Hugh Grant is far too charming to be able to carry off this version of the loutish and soulless ""Simon Cowell""-style host of ""American Dreamz"".Since the show gets more votes than are cast in Presidential elections, this Administration decides to bolster sagging poll numbers by having the President appear as a guest judge on ""American Dreamz"".  Mandy Moore is quite good as the ambitious ""babe"" contestant, and Shohreh Aghdashloo, an Oscar contender for her supporting role in ""House of Sand and Fog"", is a gem who sparkles whenever she is on screen, however small the role. I was baffled as to why Chris Klein seemed to be either trying to channel or satirize Keanu Reeves, but it was difficult to tell which, and not a particularly worthwhile exercise.  (I would personally rather have seen Keanu Reeves.) Sam Golzari, playing the accidental Arab contestant who happens to be a member of a terrorist sleeper cell, slowly grows on you as he ""Omer-izes"" his Dreamz audience, but it is Omer's American family which has by far the best scenes.The movie is overly ambitious as farce, and yet mostly tries to go for easy laughs. At its most uncomfortable, it appeared to be trying misguidedly and ham-handedly to satirize ""Paradise Now"" or ""The War Within"", both serious, excellent movies, nominated for major awards.  ""American Dreamz"" may qualify for Razzie nominations in costume and make-up.It might be as important a movie as it wants to be when in a distant century, the DVD is discovered under rubble or taken out of a time capsule for a too-facile historical comparison of our pop culture obsession with the ""bread and circuses"" mentality near the end of the Roman Empire.

Walker ""geminiwalker""","[0, 0]","This is a good date movie for fans of American Idol who are capable of laughing and thinking at the same time...good characteristics to seek in any potential partner. I would call it silly social commentary for those who are capable of laughing at themselves - and the sad state of affairs the American Democracy has become at the moment. The most poingnant question this movie asks, almost as an aside, is this: how responsible ARE the American people for America as it exists today? The sad answer is; nobody knows. The Government is out of control, and the people are looking the other way.You're right; the state of our democracy is not funny, but as some of our wisest entertainers know, it is much easier to make a point with humor than with pathos. Maybe if we can laugh about it we can talk about it without killing each other. I certainly hope so.I'm a big fan of Hugh Grant. He has yet to let me down. I would call him sentimentally funny. I like that in a man.Picture this: the final contestants are an Arab, a Jew, and an American princess - and the President of the United States is one of the final judges. Neither the President nor his Aid (who remarkably resembles Dick Cheney) portray the EVIL of the current administration - they don't dare. They have to be funny to be palatable to a movie going audience (unless the director is Michael Moore). So, these guys are funny.

What has this got to do with an AMERICAN IDOL spoof?Many have criticized that there is nothing funny about Al-Queda, but I disagree. This is the ONE THING that American Dreamz does right. When Omer Obeidi (Sam Golzari) is sent to America because he's caught dancing and singing to show tunes in his tent, he's mostly being cast away as a sleeper cell terrorist, never to be actually used. So, when he's mistakenly spotted by the casting directors of AMERICAN DREAMZ and put on a show that will be guest-judged by the President of the United States, his terrorist brothers come calling.Ultimately, it's not a bad move to poke fun at Al-Queda. AMERICAN DREAMZ points out what Al-Queda terrorists are missing out on... singing, dancing, the thrill of friendly competition and most importantly, the celebration of LIFE. So, when the Al-Queda leader is watching the show in Afghanistan and comments, ""Oh, he killed that!"" It's effectively funny and makes you kind of wish that they would celebrate life a little bit, instead of celebrating the afterlife.In fact, there are a lot of good things about AMERICAN DREAMZ. The terrorist who come to visit Omer and sit in the swimming pool, or gathering around eating pizza while they watch AMERICAN DREAMZ intently. Not to mention, MANDY MOORE is excellent as the ruthless, win or else Sally Kendoo. Oh, and Omer's cousin Iqbal Riza (Tony Yalda) is tremendously funny.Where AMERICAN DREAMZ falls short for me is with the show itself. The movie is ment to be a spoof of AMERICAN IDOL, yet, the show is not explored fully. Where is the behind the scenes cat fights? The competition? The preparation? The attitudes? They skip from the opening episode of AMERICAN DREAMZ into a montage and we're in the final 3 before you know it.Ultimately, the AMERICAN DREAMZ show is very very cheesy and CHEAP. Martin Tweed (Hugh Grant) sits in a chair making silly comments to the contestants. The performances are cheesy. The songs are cheesy. And not cheesy in a funny way. I mean, couldn't the tremendously wealthy and hugely successful UNIVERSAL STUDIOS shell out some money and get some REAL songs to spoof?I'm surprised that Mandy Moore sang some of these goofy songs...

My version goes something like this: The complacency of an American public that has been seduced by a game show has allowed our leader to lead us into a disastrous war. The problem with ""American Dreamz"" is that the dots are not connected as well as they should have been. The opposite of nimble, this film rambles all over the political and cultural fabric of America mowing down anything in its path. The president of this universe President Staton (Dennis Quaid) has just been re-elected for a second term. But his sudden discovery of the magic of the written word has caused him to bunker himself down and go on an all out learning binge. This is bad for his chief of staff (Willem Dafoe) who has to field questions from a feisty press (wouldn't it be nice) and who is concerned that the president might start thinking for himself. So he books him as a guest judge on ""American Dreamz,"" an ""American Idol"" stand in. This is good news for the terrorists who see the opportunity to get one of their own into the final round and use a suicide bomb to blow Staton away. The script, unfortunately, needs a minor makeover as the film is OK, but also bloated and weak.Most of director Chris Weitz' venom is aimed at ""American Idol."" He portrays it as an overwhelmingly fake spectacle where the manufactured image of a poor country girl (Mandy Moore in a performance she can finally be proud of) who makes out with a puppeted war vet (Chris Klein, perfectly cast) is enough to win the hearts of America. And it is all hauntingly true. A culture of insta-celebrity has infected out country where the ""Most Popular"" award is now given out before the contestants even do anything, and is only given to the one with the best agent. The film itself is high gloss. But it is also an attack on everything that people who like high gloss entertainment hold dear. Hugh Grant riffing on Ryan Seacrest is mildly amusing, but ultimately only so so.Giving this film a thumbs down brings me no pleasure. It is brave and wants to change the way people think. The climax scores in a big way. It wants us to know, as ""Little Miss Sunshine"" also did, that the whole world is just one big beauty pageant. Still, the script was all over the map. Too many storylines in this particular kitchen. The middle section seems to go on forever. I would also say that they reached a point of overkill in the department of drawing parallels between Staton and Bush. I get it, they are the same thing, but parallels aren't comedy all by themselves. Finally, I just didn't find it to be in good taste to let the ""America Idol"" audience off the hook in the end. Yes, I agree, as silly as it is, the outrageous singing and dancing show does have the ability to bring the world closer together. Fame and fortune are pretty much universal. But the people that watch it are the same ones who truly are terrified (and manipulated) by the clips of terrorists on the monkey bars. And they are the ones who have allowed the Iraq War to continue on, unchecked, because the singing and dancing show constituted a higher priority for them.

Last night my wife and I sat down to enjoy what I thought would be endless laughs but instead were left wanting, really wanting.  No, this film is not by any means terrible, but it lacks the pure comedic timing that was promised by the previews.  Yes, the reviews for the film were somewhat all over the place, but I never listen to critics anyways.High Grant was probably the best part of the film, as he always shines as the morally ambiguous pr*ck.  Mandy Moore was also delightful, as she is always, but I did feel that her performance was far from her best.  This film really takes more of a crack at the current President then American Idol.  This is the film Bush DOES NOT WANT YOU TO SEE.  As a matter of fact, Dennis Quaid is pretty good here, especially towards the end when on the show and he says ""turn that freaking thing off"" and then looks at Hugh as if he didn't do anything wrong...priceless.So the plot is so much different then I expected it to be.  There are terrorist that plan to kill the president during the finale of American Dreamz and they use show tune loving Omer to do it.  The cast for the most part does a fine job; Dafoe (who I normally can't stand) takes on the Cheney role quite nicely, but as always, the main comedic timing fell on the part of the token gay guy played by Tony Yalda.  As Omer's cousin Iqbal, Tony plays the horrible dancer/singer who dreams of stardom and who everyone mocks in ridicule.  Hilarious.Anyways, here I've gone a praised it but I must add that although there are funny moments, they are for the most part sprinkled in amidst generic teen comedy fluff and it never really becomes it's own film.

643560,A1Q1PP3Z4QDUQM,B00005JOX3,Farffleblex Plaffington,"[2, 3]","Not much about American Dreamz worked for me as it should have, unless the point was an unfocused, mostly unfunny and non-entertaining film that tries to demonstrate the clich&eacute; that truth is stranger than fiction.  It doesn't work as a spoof, it doesn't work as a slightly humorous critical commentary on anything, and it doesn't work as a purely fantastical story.The aim seems to have been a spoof of the television show ""American Idol"", of George W. Bush, of militant Islamism, and very slightly of American culture in general.  That's the first problem.  American Dreamz tries to do too many things.  There are too many disparate threads that not only are never quite woven together, but many are left by the wayside.  For much of its length, it feels like we're bouncing back and forth among a number of different films, and because of this, nothing has a chance to develop very well.  Many good actors are more or less wasted.  Because of the too varied structure, even some stars who get a relatively significant amount of screen time are wasted.  For example, while the Bush spoof usually doesn't work very well as a spoof, Dennis Quaid's portrayal of the dim-witted and odd President Staton is often interesting and occasionally funny, but he's just not in the film enough; if the story had been focused almost exclusively on President Staton, it might have been successful.The American Idol spoof material fails for three reasons:One, Hugh Grant can't carry the role.  He has to function as the three American Idol judges (with a strong emphasis on Simon Cowell) and host Ryan Seacrest all rolled into one.  It requires a maybe impossibly complex and conflicted character, with Grant barely scratching the surface.  Of course, it doesn't help that like everyone else, he has to fight for screen time with too many different stories.Two (and this shows another reason why too many threads was a bad idea), for one aspect of the American Idol spoof material, writer/director Paul Weitz errs on the side of making his focus too narrow.  There aren't enough contestants to follow, and the funneling down of the judges and host into one person fails in theory, too.  Part of what makes American Idol work is that we get to know a number of different personalities by way of seeing the same contestants over many weeks, and of course by getting to know and watch the interesting combination of judge and host personalities.  In American Dreamz, it's as if there are really only two contestants (with a later addition of one cardboard cutout contestant who is good for a couple jokes), and again because of the poor structure, we hardly get to know them.  Having only two contestants and one host/judge doesn't seem like a good idea any way you slice it.Three, and this may be the most important one, American Dreamz is never as funny, ridiculous, bizarre, sad, poignant or inspiring as American Idol can be throughout the course of a season.The militant Islamism and general American culture stuff suffers primarily from being severely underdeveloped.  Enough of the material set in and concerning the militant camp overseas is kinda funny, but there's just not much of it in the film.  And the general American culture spoof is so wispy that it's difficult to say if it was even an intention.Of course, as a spoof, the point is not to approximate qualities and facts of the real-world material being spoofed.  And too many threads wouldn't have to be a bad thing.  I love the Scary Movie films.  They definitely get a lot ""wrong"" about what they're spoofing, and the ridiculous alternation of many different stories is part of what makes them work.  But when the material that you're spoofing is far funnier and more weird/bizarre than your spoof, it's difficult to even consider your work to be in that genre.  Furthermore, if your work is intended as a (cultural) critique, that can't function correctly when the stuff you're critiquing is transparently far more complex and nuanced than your critique.  And for just straight-ahead entertainment, which seems like maybe it was the point on some of the American Idol spoof material, such as a couple of the songs, neither the songs nor the performances were anywhere near as good or enjoyable as the worst night on American Idol, and that can get pretty bland.I'm not one to usually agree with the following, but this case is an exception: it seems like Weitz didn't have a clear idea of what he wanted to accomplish with this film.  He needed to pick one basic idea--a spoof of President Bush, a critique of the office of the Presidency, an absurdist look at militant Islamism, a cynical film about American Idol . . . whatever, and commit to it.  As American Dreamz stands, there is only a collection of half-baked and half-realized ideas mucking about in a chaotic jumble with maybe accidental moments (although maybe not accidental as they tend to be when Weitz pushes absurdist comic material) that reach their potential.  Hardly recommendable.Think for a moment about hit pop records.  They can be spoofed/parodied/satirized effectively--just listen to some Weird Al Yankovich.  But American Dreamz, rather than taking that road, seems to me like those old K-Tel versions of pop songs (the ones with ""Not the original artists"" in tiny writing on the bottom near the copyright data).  It's just a pale imitation of the real thing, with not much to say about the original that we didn't already know, and certainly not more entertaining than the original, but rather more vacuous, where the producers seem to have not quite understood what made the originals work, and neither do they try to do anything different with the material.",2,Mostly a mess,1163635200,"11 16,

643561,ATZ1LTONGHOP6,B00005JOX3,Genevieve Hayes,"[3, 4]","""American Dreamz"" is a black-comedy/satire about an unwilling Middle Eastern terrorist who is called on to murder the U.S. President when he becomes a contestant on ""American Dreamz"", and ""American Idol""-esque talent show.When ""American Dreamz"" was on at the cinema, I thought it was just another stupid comedy making fun of reality-television, much like Ben Elton's ""Chart Throb"" (which I found to be disappointing, might I add). It was only when I found a cheap DVD copy of this film that I decided to give it a chance, and man, was I surprised. ""American Dreamz"" is smart, funny and highly underrated.The idea of blending a comedy about reality television with a topical issue such as terrorism is just brilliant, and the script and the acting are great too. Hugh Grant is perfect as the self-absorbed Martin Tweed, host of ""American Dreamz"", a character so egocentric that he makes comments like ""sometimes I envy myself"", and Dennis Quaid does an equally good job as a President who bears more than a passing resemblance to George W. Book.  Normally, I can't stand Hugh Grant, but for the first time in his career, I actually liked him. In fact, in the final scenes, he and Quaid had me rolling around my lounge room laughing. I think the thing that I liked most about this film, though, was the fact that all of the characters are written in a sympathetic manner. Writer/director Paul Weitz could easily have chosen to make fun of his cast of characters, but instead he seems to genuinely care for them and as a result he presents characters whom the audience can genuinely like and cheer for. Weitz did a similar thing in his directorial debut, ""American Pie"", and it was for this reason, I believe, that ""American Pie"" stands out as being one of the best teen movies of recent years.This film came and went at the cinemas far too quickly and I think that is mainly due to the fact that most people didn't realize what this film was actually about.

At the end of the movie we see Dafoe's ""Cheney"" left behind by the president --and here's where we see some serious lack of teeth--and then the president blossoms from moron to an independent, intelligent, kind and resourceful president as if to say without real life Cheney, real life Bush would be awesome.Everything about the show is very obvious, with the obnoxiousness of American Idol represented by American Dreamz, Cowell represented by Grant, etc. The marine of the movie is probably going to get the most undeserved praise/hate because he is a bumbling moron, but the movie clearly lacks the balls to say anything of the sort about the troops as a whole in such a way, so to examine the character (or anything else in this movie, for that matter) is an empty exercise. Moore does a great job of convincing us that she is an actress and not a singer, then throws it all away in an excruciating 3 minute song ""Dreamz with a Z"" (or something like that).The movie is very obvious and brainless but fun at the same time.

It's a tricky job to determine the tone of a comedy, and just as important as the success of the jokes themselves.  Such is the case with ""American Dreamz"", the latest Paul Weitz comedy.  It seems to be reaching for the satirical sharpness of ""Network"" or ""To Die For"", but the overall tone is so gentle it throws the dark subject matter into bold, awkward relief.""Dreamz"" contains four sub-plots.  The first involves President Staton (Dennis Quaid), a Bush-like statesman who is having a crisis after his latest election victory.  He realizes he knows nothing about the nation, and is scrambling to to view things beyond his staff's carfeully filtered briefings.  His approval ratings have plummeted, and rumors abound of a nervous breakdown.  The solution?  Have the president guest judge the highest-rated television show ever - the ""Idol""-like ""American Dreamz"".We're then introduced to Martin Tweed (Hugh Grant), the Simon-Cowell-style host of the program.  He's being dumped by his current paramour, and is feeling bored, a prisoner of the show's success.  To keep himself interested, he makes increasingly bizarre contestant choices.This involves Omer (Sam Golzari), an inept Iraqi terrorist whose secret passion is show tunes, driving his fellow extremists to distraction.  He's soon 're-assigned' to stay with his relatives in California as a sleeper cell, awaiting orders that will (presumably) never come.  Omer meets his gay cousin Iqbal (Tony Yalda), who has applied to become a ""Dreamz"" contestant.  Things get complicated, though, when Omer's good-naturedness gets him chosen over Iqbal.""Dreamz's"" talent search also discovers Sally Kendoo (Mandy Moore), a calculating manipulator determined to win the show at any cost.  She too has just dumped her steadfast boyfriend William Williams (Chris Klein) - she is repelled by his kind heart - and he responds by enlisting in the army.  Tweed finds a kindred spirit in Sally, or at least a worthy adversary -  he's never met anyone more self-centered than he is.  Naturally, she's a shoe-in for the show.  When William returns from Iraq wounded, her agent encourages her to fake renewing the romance to boost her vote count.Since the president is now to be a guest judge, and Omer a contestant, the terrorist leaders order Omer to spearhead an assassination attempt.  Iqbal begins managing him, and Omer's popularity is a direct threat to Sally's victory.  Naturally, everything races together on a collision course.Most of this isn't very believable, even on comedic terms.  It's never convincing that Quaid's president would allow himself to get into this situation.  It's also tough to buy that Omer would be chosen over Iqbal, as Iqbal is more entertaning simply standing around talking than Omer is singing (Yalda's performance is one of the most consistently entertaining in the film).  Additionally, Omer is too conflicted from the beginning to be very vivid as a performer or a terrorist.  Sally is pushed to new heights of ambition by her agent, but this role hardly seems necessary considering her new love interest (and her own nature seems too knowing).It's also odd that we begin the film with the president in a position of strength (having won the election).  It would seem like there'd be a lot more opportunity for suspense (and satire) by setting the story in the beginning of the re-election campaign *and* the latest season of ""Dreamz"", and have the film take place over that year. The plot would then culminate in the election and the finalists' showdown.  The film as it stands has little tension - we know only a couple of the contestants can have a chance to win, or there's no story.This premise intrinsically involves the corruptive powers of fame, coupled with a terrorist assination of the President on national television.  This is pretty dark stuff, but the film never seems to want to move beyond the tone of a light cartoonish farce.  As a result, most of the jokes fall uncomfortably flat.  Quaid is miscast - he seems far too handsome, intelligent and confident to portray a buffoonish proxy growing dissatisfied with his own powerlessness.  Dafoe's Cheney never seems that nasty, either - he's simply doing what needs to be done to put this guy across to the public.  The Kendoo/Tweed romance isn't a bad set-up, but their mutual wickedness doesn't focus into something darkly compelling.  Instead, it simply curdles into two despicable people who probably deserve each other.Considering how crowd-pleasing the film wants to be, it takes a big risk by making *the entire cast* caught up in the struggle for fame and power.  It's fine to make all of your main characters corruptible, but the script doesn't have the courage of its convictions, and there's no innocent secondary characters for contrast.  Even William gets sucked into the fame/power whirlpool, but it's never clear why, or even appropriate.  The film could use William better as a moral center, unwittingly duped by Sally, who'd been sleeping with Tweed all along.  This would make for a stronger betrayal in the last third, and better justify his desperate actions as a result.  Iqbal, had he been the contestant, could have simply been blinded by ambition, manipulated by the terrorists until the last minute.The film seems to want to portray this greed for fame and power as destructive, but only two characters truly reap the whirlwind.

Loria,"[5, 7]","Writer/director Paul Weitz (AMERICAN PIE , ABOUT a BOY) hits us with his new film American Dreamz satirizes the White House incompetence, the flaws in the ""war on terror"" and the idiocy of TV's ""American Idol."" Weitz uses these easy targets for send-ups, while (again) attempting to make us like stupid and unlikable characters. While this worked in ABOUT a BOY and his AMERICAN PIE series of films, it is awkward at best, and he has greatest success with his show tune loving-would-be-terrorist, OMER. Let me explain......the story begins when President Staton (Dennis Quaid) wakes up one morning and decides, for the first time, to read the newspaper. He awakens to the possibilities of an outside world. Meanwhile, the self-absorbed host of TV's talent contest ""American Dreamz,"" Martin Tweed (Hugh Grant), about to start another season, he demands to have an Arab represented on the show. His call is answered by, Omer (Sam Golzari), a less than enthusiastic terrorist ""sleeper"" dumped for incompetence and sent to the U.S. to live with family waiting for his orders. The future ""American Dreamz"" winner, Sally Kendoo (Mandy Moore), callously prepares for her future in showbiz by keeping her dim ex-boyfriend (Chris Klein) only to win votes. Willem Dafoe as a Cheney-looking Vice President,  works to get the President, & the States, back under control, give Staton ""happy pills"" and making him wear an earpiece when speaking in public. As part of a PR blitz the President will make a guest appearance on ""American Dreamz"" in a painfully contrived connecting of characters.  Weitz spends much of the movie attempting to humanizing these quirky stereotypes, the President starts to look like a nice, but spaced-out guy, along with the First-lady (Marcia Gay Harden), while even the shallow Sally and cynical Martin are revealed to be lonely behind their Hollywood facades.In the end the movie falls short, after all the character tinkering Weitz fails to make a cohesive story. He supplies lots of interesting performances and interesting characters like: Tony Yalda as Iqbal, the flamboyantly gay cousin who helps with Omer's TV image; Jennifer Coolidge as Sally Mom, Chris Klein as Sally's boyfriend, Dafoe's VP has some great scene with the Staton as does Sam Golzari as the ""Omerizing"" contestant who may or may not win or blow-up the Prez.  The movie's strength lies in the bashing of iconic sterotypes, from TV and from the general public, more concerned with reality TV voting than voting in a presidential election, in fact it is the movie's tagline. Another strength of the film is the energy used pointing out items made off limits for questioning or discussion, no matter how obvious, like the President blurting out that the War was a bad idea. But I expected more from this one, given the talent behind the project.",2,"""BAD is such a nebulous word""",1146441600,"05 1, 2006",2006,2832,"['Writer/director', 'Paul', 'Weitz', 'AMERICAN', 'PIE', 'ABOUT', 'BOY', 'new', 'film', 'American', 'Dreamz', 'White', 'House', 'incompetence', 'flaws', 'war', 'terror', 'idiocy', 'TV', 'American', 'Idol', 'Weitz', 'easy', 'targets', 'send-ups', 'again', 'attempting', 'make', 'stupid', 'unlikable', 'characters', 'worked', 'ABOUT', 'BOY', 'AMERICAN', 'PIE', 'series', 'films', 'awkward', 'best', 'greatest', 'success', 'show', 'loving-would-be-terrorist', 'OMER', 'Let', 'explain', 'story', 'when', 'President', 'Staton', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'up', 'one', 'morning', 'decides', 'first', 'time', 'read', 'newspaper', 'possibilities', 'outside', 'world', 'Meanwhile', 'self-absorbed', 'host', 'TV', 'talent', 'contest', 'American', 'Dreamz', 'Martin', 'Tweed', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'about', 'start', 'season', 'have', 'Arab', 'represented', 'show', 'call', 'answered', 'Omer', 'Sam', 'Golzari', 'less', 'enthusiastic', 'terrorist', 'sleeper', 'dumped', 'incompetence', 'sent', 'U.S.', 'live', 'family', 'waiting', 'orders', 'future', 'American', 'Dreamz', 'winner', 'Sally', 'Kendoo', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'callously', 'future', 'showbiz', 'keeping', 'dim', 'ex-boyfriend', 'Chris', 'Klein', 'only', 'win', 'votes', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'Cheney-looking', 'Vice', 'President', 'get', 'President', 'States', 'back', 'control', 'give', 'Staton', 'happy', 'pills', 'making', 'wear', 'earpiece', 'when', 'speaking', 'public', 'part', 'PR', 'President', 'will', 'make', 'guest', 'appearance', 'American', 'Dreamz', 'painfully', 'contrived', 'connecting', 'characters', 'Weitz', 'much', 'movie', 'attempting', 'humanizing', 'quirky', 'stereotypes', 'President', 'look', 'nice', 'spaced-out', 'guy', 'First-lady', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'even', 'shallow', 'Sally', 'cynical', 'Martin', 'are', 'revealed', 'be', 'lonely', 'Hollywood', 'facades.In', 'end', 'movie', 'short', 'character', 'tinkering', 'Weitz', 'make', 'cohesive', 'story', 'lots', 'interesting', 'performances', 'interesting', 'characters', 'Tony', 'Yalda', 'Iqbal', 'flamboyantly', 'gay', 'cousin', 'who', 'Omer', 'TV', 'image', 'Jennifer', 'Coolidge', 'Sally', 'Mom', 'Chris', 'Klein', 'Sally', 'boyfriend', 'Dafoe', 'VP', 'great', 'scene', 'Staton', 'Sam', 'Golzari', 'Omerizing', 'contestant', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'win', 'blow-up', 'Prez', 'movie', 'strength', 'bashing', 'iconic', 'sterotypes', 'TV', 'general', 'public', 'more', 'concerned', 'reality', 'TV', 'voting', 'voting', 'presidential', 'election', 'fact', 'movie', 'tagline', 'strength', 'film', 'energy', 'used', 'pointing', 'out', 'items', 'made', 'off', 'limits', 'questioning', 'discussion', 'matter', 'how', 'obvious', 'President', 'blurting', 'out', 'War', 'was', 'bad', 'idea', 'expected', 'more', 'one', 'given', 'talent', 'project']",N/A
643573,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B00005JOX3,Kevin Killian,"[1, 2]","You know what, maybe it isn't a five start movie after all, but you know how it is when you go into a show having heard it's the worst comedy ever made and little by little it dawns on you, hey, this show ain't so bad after all?  So maybe you tend to overpraise it.  Nevertheless to me it seems miles better than ABOUT A BOY or AMERICAN PIE and makes me look forward now to seeing THE GOLDEN COMPASS this winter.  OK, maybe the targets are tired (the Bush administration and AMERICAN IDOL) but throwing them together with terrorism was a good trifecta, and all in all I liked what they did with Mandy Moore, who plays Sally Kendoo in a strangely and appealingly old-fashioned way, as a character part, a character Jeanne Crain might have played for Jospeh Mankiewicz in the early 1950s, or maybe Ellen Burstyn in a 1970s Bob Rafelson film.  Sally's not a good person not really a bad person, she's just there, on the screen, sitting somewhere outside the normal range of parts for women in contemporary Hollywood film.We see that she's greedy and fake, and worse of all she uses her boyfriend's love for you and takes it and betrays him with Hugh Grant of all people.  And yet we see she's been pushed into showbiz, Jonbenet style, by a mother who was fulfilling her own ""American Dreamz"" by using her daughter as a baby doll.  Weitz provides a devastating, brief sequence in which Jennifer Coolidge narrates a promotional segment and claims, ""Sally never had to pushed into singing, she was always on,"" but what we see is the little girl, shy, afraid, being prodded beyond endurance by adults anxious to take advantage of her cuteness.  It's the one honestly shocking moment in the movie, but it's real.Moore looks like she gained weight, went up and down, as the script demanded?  Or was it that the script was touched up to account for the way Moore looks from reel to reel?  Whatever, this slight uncertainty gives the movie a 70s badge of ""reality,"" the authenticity of anxiety.  She doesn't look good in every scene; Sally is maybe not a natural beauty, but she can turn it on, like Jessica Simpson or Britney Spears, and thus the film, which seems to be jeering at mediocrity at every term, thus betrays a little core of sympathy with those of us who just aren't ""on"" at every second of the day.  This generosity extends all the way up to the Presidency, at which point I drew back.  Does anyone, even Weitz, believe that Bush wouldn't be Bush if he read a newspaper or a book once in his lifetime, or if he wasn't the puppet of Cheney, Rove and Rumsfeld?  Unfortunately, even if Bush took the rubber earpiece out and threw it into the night sky over Baghdad, and even if he read two books, I think he would still be the same mean old clown, but that's just me, and as you can tell, I live in San Francisco.",5,American Prophecy,1185580800,"07 28, 2007",2007,2814,"['know', 'what', 'maybe', ""n't"", 'five', 'start', 'movie', 'know', 'how', 'when', 'go', 'show', 'having', 'heard', 'worst', 'comedy', 'ever', 'made', 'little', 'little', 'hey', 'show', 'ai', ""n't"", 'so', 'bad', 'So', 'maybe', 'tend', 'overpraise', 'Nevertheless', 'miles', 'better', 'A', 'BOY', 'AMERICAN', 'PIE', 'look', 'forward', 'now', 'seeing', 'THE', 'GOLDEN', 'COMPASS', 'winter', 'OK', 'maybe', 'targets', 'are', 'tired', 'Bush', 'administration', 'AMERICAN', 'IDOL', 'throwing', 'together', 'terrorism', 'was', 'good', 'trifecta', 'liked', 'what', 'did', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'who', 'Sally', 'Kendoo', 'strangely', 'appealingly', 'old-fashioned', 'way', 'character', 'part', 'character', 'Jeanne', 'Crain', 'might', 'have', 'played', 'Jospeh', 'Mankiewicz', 'early', '1950s', 'maybe', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', '1970s', 'Bob', 'Rafelson', 'film', 'Sally', 'not', 'good', 'person', 'not', 'really', 'bad', 'person', 'just', 'there', 'screen', 'sitting', 'somewhere', 'normal', 'range', 'parts', 'women', 'contemporary', 'Hollywood', 'film.We', 'see', 'greedy', 'fake', 'worse', 'boyfriend', 'love', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'people', 'yet', 'see', 'been', 'pushed', 'showbiz', 'Jonbenet', 'style', 'mother', 'who', 'was', 'fulfilling', 'own', 'American', 'Dreamz', 'using', 'daughter', 'baby', 'doll', 'Weitz', 'devastating', 'brief', 'sequence', 'Jennifer', 'Coolidge', 'promotional', 'segment', 'claims', 'Sally', 'never', 'had', 'pushed', 'singing', 'was', 'always', 'what', 'see', 'little', 'girl', 'shy', 'afraid', 'being', 'prodded', 'endurance', 'adults', 'anxious', 'take', 'advantage', 'cuteness', 'one', 'honestly', 'shocking', 'moment', 'movie', 'real.Moore', 'looks', 'gained', 'weight', 'went', 'up', 'down', 'script', 'demanded', 'was', 'script', 'was', 'touched', 'up', 'account', 'way', 'Moore', 'reel', 'reel', 'Whatever', 'slight', 'uncertainty', 'movie', '70s', 'badge', 'reality', 'authenticity', 'anxiety', ""n't"", 'look', 'good', 'scene', 'Sally', 'maybe', 'not', 'natural', 'beauty', 'can', 'turn', 'Jessica', 'Simpson', 'Britney', 'Spears', 'thus', 'film', 'be', 'jeering', 'mediocrity', 'term', 'thus', 'little', 'core', 'sympathy', 'who', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'second', 'day', 'generosity', 'way', 'Presidency', 'point', 'drew', 'back', 'Does', 'anyone', 'even', 'Weitz', 'believe', 'Bush', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'Bush', 'read', 'newspaper', 'book', 'once', 'lifetime', 'was', ""n't"", 'puppet', 'Cheney', 'Rove', 'Rumsfeld', 'Unfortunately', 'even', 'Bush', 'took', 'rubber', 'out', 'threw', 'night', 'sky', 'Baghdad', 'even', 'read', 'two', 'books', 'think', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'same', 'mean', 'old', 'clown', 'just', 'can', 'tell', 'live', 'San', 'Francisco']",N/A

However, as soon as he won, he goes into seclusion and perhaps depression from his presidential duties.  His wife and chief-of-staff do everything possible to get him back in the spotlight.  With everything failing, his COS manages to get him as a guest judge on American Dreamz.Upon hearing this, the Middle East terrorists enlist one of their own to join the singing competition.Meanwhile, there's one competitor who really wants to achieve the American Dream of being a singer, Sally Kendoo (Moore).

American Dreamz (based on American Idol) is hosted by callous, driven, and cold Martin Tweed (Hugh Grant), a British snob all the rage in Southern California. Ohio aspirant Sally Kendoo (Mandy Moore) is the best karaoke singer in her county. Once she is selected as a dreamer for a new season of American Dreamz her fire in the belly of ambition becomes a volcano. Sally will sell her soul to win the contest. Meanwhile, Omar, a secret mole from the Middle East is accidentally selected instead of his flaming queen of a cousin Iqbar in Beverley Hills. Omar's entry into American Dreamz fuels a plot to assassinate President Stanton who is the guest judge on the final sing-off. In between is Sally's oily talent agent, her stage mother, and love struck boyfriend William Williams (Chris Klein) who is a war vet. Sally and her agent are more than happy to capitalize on William's service record to have her win. The President Stanton character (Dennis Quaid) is a laugh in his own right. A puppet of his Chief of Staff (Willam Defoe) whose sudden interest in reading the papers and complex political analysis has his aides worried about his mental health.American Dreamz is a hilarious social commentary on the American culture of cult celebrity worship. Everyone wants to be on TV. Reality shows have taken over prime time. Back in the late 70's and early 80's many futuristic shows depicted this eventual reality and it is disturbing. Sally Kendoo is so determined to be a star that she will stop short of nothing - even accept a live proposal from her boyfriend after having a backstage fling with Martin Tweed. American Dreamz is funny because it is much closer to the truth than fiction. Overnight stardom is so much a possibility that the craziness is more intense. Selling one's soul is a given. American Dreamz is one laugh at the nightmare of ""fame for fame's sake"". No wonder Julia Cameron (once married to Martin Scorcese called fame a spiritual drug).

I laughed a few times, but it was because of good actors who took the little they had to work with and made some of the film work in small spots.If you detest shows like American Idol or the horrible latest offering of Grease:  You're the One that I Want (which one viewing was 90 minutes of my life I will never get back), that premise alone will make you laugh.  Mandy Moore's Sally Kendoo is just so much of the overhyped Carrie Underwood type of character that is supposed to be everybody's darling, but you actually hate because of the undeserved hype not given to genuine talents who have been struggling for years.  As much as I tend to like Moore in spurts, this is one time I can't stand her, or perhaps it's that annoying character.  The extra with her is as painfully lacking in humor as her performance, and it's a shame because she is a real talent.  It's time she utilize it more proficiently than in movies like this or her last couple of bombs.What's funny is Hugh Grant as the Simon of the show, because he is so very good at playing bitter, cocky English guys.  Dennis Quaid and Marcia Gay Harden are funny as thinly disguised versions of the Bush's, but this semi-conservative thought it got to being overly caricaturized.  Willem Dafoe was NOT funny, and if this show was supposed to be an American Idol spoof, how did a dopey Broadway loving terrorist get to be in the semi-finals?  Of course, that's what is in itself funny.  Why they didn't give his name a mention on the box since a great deal of the plot revolves around his character is a mystery, so I have to maintain that the only true reason for sitting through this entire mess is Tony Yalba who plays cousin Iqbal.  He is very funny in his attitude and demeanor, and I hope to see more of him in better films, because he's proven himself to be a strong supporting character actor.I can recommend far better movies than this one that spoof some form of entertainment genre like Spinal Tap, but if you despise alleged ""talent"" shows, try American Dreamz to see just how much better an amateur script writer can do than Paul Weitz and his tribe.  A few good jokes and some good actors only merits this movie 2.5 stars in my book, but Ammy doesn't let us do 1/2 pointers.

643580,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B00005JOX3,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[0, 1]","American Dreamz involves a collision between an uneducated and ineffectual president (played by Dennis Quaid who is made up to resemble current president Bush) and the Hollywood entertainment industry with a show run by the fabulously wealthy, shallow and hateful Martin Tweed (Hugh Grant). The movie lampoons the current Bush presidency as the president's coach and chief of staff, played by Willem Dafoe, appears remarkably like vice president Cheney. In fact, the president's wife is named Linda (almost Laura) and they sport their southern (Texas?) accents all the way through the picture. At the same time, the Hollywood entertainment industry is skewered by Hugh Grant's Martin Tweed, who resembles Simon on American Idol as he goes to extremes to get whatever he wants so that American Dreamz remains number one in the ratings.The movie starts with the beginning of a new season of American Dreamz; and Martin Tweed calls upon his team to come up with ""some freaks"" for his American Dreamz's new season. The team picks a wide variety of some of the most unlikely game show participants; besides the types of singers that we normally see on American Idol the team also chooses a Hassidic Jew and an Arab with terrorist ties who will force him to sabotage the show in a violent way. There is also the rather superficial, bratty yet beautiful blonde bombshell Sally Kendoo, played by Mandy Moore.We soon see a parallel in this movie: just as the president and his chief of staff want him to look good and be popular; the contestants and Martin Tweed equally crave the same things. Everyone's paths will cross when the president is booked to be a guest judge for an episode of American Dreamz when they will determine which one singer is the best of all the contestants.The action takes place as the contestants warm up for the show and experience the elimination process. It gets whittled down and as this happens we begin to wonder more and more what will happen: Will the Arab, Omer, become so comfortable in his American home that he no longer wishes to sabotage the show--or will he be true to his sleeper cell and cause incredible harm and chaos? What about Omer's cousin, a superstar wannabe?  When his thunder is stolen because the show picks his cousin Omer (Sam Golzari) to be a contestant, will he want revenge? AND, what about the president who is booked to be a guest judge on the same show where there could be violence? No spoilers here, folks; you'll have to watch the movie to find out.Unfortunately, what could have been an excellent comedy just doesn't do the trick. Some jokes and themes will amuse you, as in the beginning when Omer's cousin is kicked out of a terrorist training camp because he is not aggressive and listens to American show tunes at night in his tent. Other themes and jokes remain only half-baked, including the idea that the president must wear a hearing device so that his chief of staff can whisper the ""correct"" answers into it for him to say.As one reviewer notes, the film takes sharp aim at American Idol as Martin Tweed of American Dreamz makes up fake sob stories for his show's contestants like Mandy Moore's Sally Kendoo. They use her boyfriend, William Williams (played by Chris Klein), as a puppet for her to appear to be a very appealing contestant to vote for to be the sole survivor of American Dreamz. It's great to see Martin Tweed's results for his sleazy style and ruthlessness; but you may feel differently about the way things work out for William Williams.The casting was well done but the script lacks punch.Overall, American Dreamz does the job up to a point as you will see in the first half or so of the movie; but the ending just doesn't measure up to be what it could have been. Other reviewers seem to agree with me; although some may say that it was the middle part that dragged or they may write that something else didn't work right. The bottom line is that American Dreamz is an average comedy that's good for some laughs and a little diversion for an hour and a half. American Dreamz does not take itself too seriosuly and it wasn't trying to be comedy of the year, either. While it will relieve you from the stresses of everyday life for about an hour and one-half, I doubt that you'll want to go back and watch this one over and over again.",5,I have been Omerized--NOT !!!,1175385600,"04 1, 2007",2007,4321,"['American', 'Dreamz', 'collision', 'uneducated', 'ineffectual', 'president', 'played', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'who', 'made', 'up', 'resemble', 'current', 'president', 'Bush', 'Hollywood', 'entertainment', 'industry', 'show', 'run', 'fabulously', 'wealthy', 'shallow', 'hateful', 'Martin', 'Tweed', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'movie', 'current', 'Bush', 'presidency', 'president', 'coach', 'chief', 'staff', 'played', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'remarkably', 'like', 'vice', 'president', 'Cheney', 'fact', 'president', 'wife', 'named', 'Linda', 'almost', 'Laura', 'sport', 'southern', 'Texas', 'way', 'picture', 'same', 'time', 'Hollywood', 'entertainment', 'industry', 'skewered', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'Martin', 'Tweed', 'who', 'Simon', 'American', 'Idol', 'extremes', 'get', 'so', 'American', 'Dreamz', 'number', 'one', 'ratings.The', 'movie', 'beginning', 'new', 'season', 'American', 'Dreamz', 'Martin', 'Tweed', 'team', 'come', 'up', 'freaks', 'American', 'Dreamz', 'new', 'season', 'team', 'wide', 'variety', 'most', 'unlikely', 'game', 'show', 'participants', 'types', 'singers', 'normally', 'see', 'American', 'Idol', 'team', 'also', 'Hassidic', 'Jew', 'Arab', 'terrorist', 'ties', 'who', 'will', 'force', 'sabotage', 'show', 'violent', 'way', 'also', 'rather', 'superficial', 'bratty', 'yet', 'beautiful', 'blonde', 'bombshell', 'Sally', 'Kendoo', 'played', 'Mandy', 'Moore.We', 'soon', 'see', 'parallel', 'movie', 'just', 'president', 'chief', 'staff', 'want', 'look', 'good', 'be', 'popular', 'contestants', 'Martin', 'Tweed', 'equally', 'crave', 'same', 'things', 'Everyone', 'paths', 'will', 'cross', 'when', 'president', 'booked', 'be', 'guest', 'judge', 'episode', 'American', 'Dreamz', 'when', 'will', 'determine', 'one', 'singer', 'best', 'contestants.The', 'action', 'place', 'contestants', 'warm', 'up', 'show', 'experience', 'elimination', 'process', 'whittled', 'down', 'begin', 'wonder', 'more', 'more', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'Will', 'Arab', 'Omer', 'become', 'so', 'comfortable', 'American', 'home', 'no', 'longer', 'wishes', 'sabotage', 'show', 'will', 'be', 'true', 'sleeper', 'cell', 'cause', 'incredible', 'harm', 'chaos', 'What', 'Omer', 'cousin', 'superstar', 'wannabe', 'When', 'thunder', 'stolen', 'show', 'cousin', 'Omer', 'Sam', 'Golzari', 'be', 'contestant', 'will', 'want', 'revenge', 'what', 'president', 'who', 'booked', 'be', 'guest', 'judge', 'same', 'show', 'where', 'could', 'be', 'violence', 'spoilers', 'here', 'folks', ""'ll"", 'have', 'watch', 'movie', 'find', 'out.Unfortunately', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'excellent', 'comedy', 'just', ""n't"", 'do', 'trick', 'jokes', 'themes', 'will', 'amuse', 'beginning', 'when', 'Omer', 'cousin', 'kicked', 'terrorist', 'training', 'camp', 'not', 'aggressive', 'American', 'show', 'tunes', 'night', 'tent', 'Other', 'themes', 'jokes', 'remain', 'only', 'half-baked', 'including', 'idea', 'president', 'must', 'wear', 'hearing', 'device', 'chief', 'staff', 'can', 'whisper', 'correct', 'answers', 'say.As', 'one', 'reviewer', 'notes', 'film', 'sharp', 'aim', 'American', 'Idol', 'Martin', 'Tweed', 'American', 'Dreamz', 'up', 'fake', 'sob', 'stories', 'show', 'contestants', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'Sally', 'Kendoo', 'use', 'boyfriend', 'William', 'Williams', 'played', 'Chris', 'Klein', 'puppet', 'appear', 'be', 'very', 'appealing', 'contestant', 'vote', 'be', 'sole', 'survivor', 'American', 'Dreamz', 'great', 'see', 'Martin', 'Tweed', 'results', 'sleazy', 'style', 'ruthlessness', 'may', 'feel', 'differently', 'way', 'things', 'work', 'out', 'William', 'Williams.The', 'casting', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'script', 'punch.Overall', 'American', 'Dreamz', 'job', 'up', 'point', 'will', 'see', 'first', 'half', 'so', 'movie', 'ending', 'just', ""n't"", 'measure', 'up', 'be', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'seem', 'agree', 'may', 'say', 'was', 'middle', 'part', 'dragged', 'may', 'write', 'something', 'else', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'right', 'bottom', 'line', 'American', 'Dreamz', 'average', 'comedy', 'good', 'laughs', 'little', 'diversion', 'hour', 'half', 'American', 'Dreamz', 'not', 'take', 'too', 'seriosuly', 'was', ""n't"", 'trying', 'be', 'comedy', 'year', 'will', 'relieve', 'stresses', 'everyday', 'life', 'hour', 'one-half', 'doubt', ""'ll"", 'want', 'go', 'back', 'watch', 'one', 'over', 'over', 'again']",N/A
643581,A2R4XG0L7Z01V8,B00005JOX3,"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ...","[0, 1]","The 21st century has become known for its addiction to reality TV shows. They're everywhere! Here in the UK, we have more than our fair share, and we can even get to see American Idol, cos they show that over here now as well. And no sooner does one end, then it's all over the press that there's another one coming. When one ends, you wonder what to do with your spare time now; when a new one starts, you wonder how you're gonna fit it around your busy social life.I can quite happily talk about this, cos I am a reality TV show addict. But I managed to impress even myself this summer, when during the seventh series of Big Brother, I went on holiday and never bothered about it. When I got home, I didn't really bother with it, apart from the eviction shows. I still love the X-Factor & American Idol, although I'm not that much of an addict that I'll vote for who I want to win. I've done it once during the entire Big Brother run.Sooner or later, there was going to be a film based on a reality TV show. And one comes out based on American Idol, with Hugh Grant playing the one & only judge (Simon Cowell!) They're playing on the premise that more people voted in American Idol than actually voted in the last American election. And those people who DID vote in the last American election, voted for the wrong guy.There's some strange actors appearing in this, who you wouldn't initally expect to appear. Hugh Grant appears as himself (again); Dennis Quaid as the going-off-the-rails unpredictable president, and Willem Dafoe as his amazing Chief of Staff. That is the role that most astounded me. He is virtually unrecognisable, and has been aged by about 20-30 years. (What a surreal experience that must be!) He really should have more screen time.Most of the film is very boring. It basically rehashes the same old from the TV show, but makes it LONGER. And then just when you think you can't take it anymore, they do a musical segment, and crush too much into too little time, backed by a cliched song.I don't think American Dreamz is a ballsy or brave movie, as some other reviewers have mentioned. It is trying to get laughs out of suicide bombers, or the situation that was in Iraq. It's not funny. Why is there a film out that is making light of this? Innocent people have died because of suicide bombers, and the director of this thought it would be fun.Mandy Moore is alright in this I guess, she's perfect for the role, as she's previously been there, done that, battled Britney.

The President, delightfully played as a moron by Dennis Quaid, is not unlike George W., his wife (Marcia Gay Harden) is reminiscent of First Lady Laura and chief advisor Willem Dafoe is a Karl Rowe clone.The comedy, written and directed by Paul Weitz, also looks into the personal lives of the TV show's producer-host (Hugh Grant), a rather self-centered fellow, as well as two of the contestants, Mandy Moore from Ohio, who is sort of a female version of Grant, and Sam Golzari, a totally incompetent Arab terrorist with a yen for Broadway show tunes.All of the performances are first-rate and the picture offers many amusing moments.  The problem with the movie is that it also tries to find humor with the war in Iraq, where many people are being killed every day, and, worse yet, it has a major subplot that involves a plan by Arab terrorists to kill the President.Unfortunately, this is a bit too close to the painful truth to evoke many laughs.Even today, more than a half century after the event, one does not find humor in the Holocaust.  You can make fun of Hitler, but not the Holocaust.With this movie, you can poke fun at former President George Bush, but the threat of a terrorist plot to kill him is not funny.Do we laugh at 9/11?

Upon reading this, Staton locks himself in his bedroom boning up on information, which causes concern for his chief of staff (Willem Dafoe) and first lady/wife (Marcia Gay Harden). Eventually, Staton finds himself booked on his favorite show, ""American Dreams"", hosted by the cynical Martin Tweed (Hugh Grant). The event is in favor of two contestants, Sally Kendoo (Many Moore) and Omer (Sam Golzari). But one of them has a dark secret that will ensure a season finale no one will soon forget.With ""American Dreams,"" Paul Weitz is finding himself in a new direction. Known for movies about getting past first base (""American Pie""), childish adults who want kids (""About a Boy""), and wounded egos in the workplace (""In Good Company""), the director is now moving into satirical comedy. Sure, we've been down this road before (on ""SNL"" and ""MadTV""), but with a potent comedy agenda and good talent involved, ""American Dreamz"" manages to entertain.Recently, critics are after this movie because of some poor satirical targets, such as ""American Idol"" and the fact that our president is a boob. Agreed, because we had ""MadTV,"" ""South Park,"" ""Saturday Night Live,"" and a dozen other shows that have tackled these subjects. Of course, it doesn't help matters if you have overexposed ""SNL"" celeb Seth Meyers in your cast (though he does bring up a funny Britney Spears reference). And the movie takes a downfall when it reaches dramatic portions, such as terrorists forcing Omer to blow himself and the president up.Weitz does get help from his cast. Like with all his recent movies, ""Dreamz"" benefits from a strong ensemble cast. The highlight of this movie is former(?) teen pop starlet Mandy Moore. She fills her character with naivet&#65533; charms (think Piper Perabo of ""Coyote Ugly"" without all the lame clich&#65533;d drama), and some doses of humor. It's very good stuff.Rounding out the cast is some familiar Weitz cast members - Dennis Quaid puts a southern drawl for Staton, Hugh Grant is wonderfully cynical as Martin Tweed, and Chris Klein is always up for a laugh as Sally's b/f. It's a shame the same can't be said for John Cho, Jennifer Coolidge, Judy Greer, Marcia Gay Harden, and others, as none of them have a lot to do in this movie.""Dreamz"" kind of runs in the similar category as any ""SNL"" Weekend Update you've seen: sophomoric play-it-safe potshots at the president, making you wonder if Tina Fey was uncredited with writing the screenplay. Still, if your cast has some likable talent like Grant, Moore, and Quaid, maybe it doesn't matter that much.

Robed terrorists are going through their paces as another man films their activities. However, in each scene, there is ONE terrorist who is messing up the shot - falling over the wall instead of jumping over it, dropping awkwardly from the climbing pole, misfiring his weapon. We discover that this person is Olmer (Sam Golzari), who is only at the camp because he is related to its director. In the privacy of his tent at night, Olmer listens to old 45s of showtunes and dreams of being a song and dance man. The camp director, wishing to get Olmer off his hands for good, packs him off to live with another relative in California, telling him that his sleeper cell will contact him when the time is right (but fully intending to abandon him).Meanwhile, Martin Tweed (Hugh Grant), the British host of a very American-Idol-like reality TV show, is trying to keep his program at the top of the ratings. They are looking for a crop of contestants for the new season, and they discover Sally Kendoo (Mandy Moore), a singer from a rural area of Ohio. When he learns that Sally has a lovestruck Iraq War veteran (Chris Klein) for a boyfriend, something sparks Tweed's mind. He charges his team to also find an Arab and a Jew as contestants, leading to what he hopes will be hefty human interest drama during the show.In the meantime, America's President (Dennis Quaid) is looking for some high profile appearances to boost approval ratings. It is decided that he'll be a guest judge on the final episode of the show, moving all the major players towards an inevitable and thoroughly entertaining conclusion.I nearly busted a gut during this movie. It is such an accurate, sly parody of American society and the U.S. marketing machine. Performances are wonderful and light. Quaid is chuckle-worthy as the befuddled president, and Moore is a force as the driven, scheming Sally Kendoo. Golzari's Omer personifies the world's fascination with America. The script is fresh, funny, and smart. Rounding out the cast are Marcia Gay Harden as the first lady, Jennifer Coolidge as Sally's pushy stage mom, and Willem Dafoe as the President's chief of staff.

643591,A24JMUNUOVABHP,B00005JOX3,NovelReader,"[1, 2]","This movie was promoted as a satire on American Idol and President Bush, but I don't really think it really is a satire.  Its portrayal of the President is both comic and sympathetic, as is its portrayal of the American Idol contestants.  So because it's not consistently cutting, if you start viewing the movie thinking that that's what you want, you'll be disappointed.But if you go into watching this movie thinking it's about what the title says it's about--American Dream(z)--you'll really enjoy it.  You have Hugh Grant playing the Simon Cowell character, who already has his dream--the big ratings and the big show and yet he hates himself at the same time.  You have Mandy Moore's character, Sally Kendoo, who basically wants the big time and will stop at nothing to get it, just like the Hugh Grant character (which is why Hugh's character becomes obsessed with her relentlessness).  Then there's the loveable contestant Omar, who joined a terror cell because his mother was killed by an American bomb, but who really wants to sing show tunes because that's the music she used to share with him.  Plus the soldier-boyfriend of Sally Kendoo, who has as his dream marriage to a nice, beautiful girl-next-door Sally that doesn't really exist.  And then there's the President, in the middle of a nervous breakdown, whose dream is to be able to say what he thinks (if he can figure out what he thinks) and not what his adviser is telling him to say.  This is thematically how it seems to hang together to me, and I think if you think of it that way and don't come into it with irrational expectations of satire, you'll see how great it works and enjoy it.The performances are all spot-on, across the board, and I enjoyed it even as a politically conservative non-American-Idol watcher.  Unusually for a comedy it does not have a categorically ""happy go lucky"" ending.  For that reason I give it five stars for originality (though it's probably more fair to assign four stars on substance).",5,"it's not satire, but I like it",1172620800,"02 28, 2007",2007,1993,"['movie', 'was', 'promoted', 'satire', 'American', 'Idol', 'President', 'Bush', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'think', 'really', 'satire', 'portrayal', 'President', 'comic', 'sympathetic', 'portrayal', 'American', 'Idol', 'contestants', 'So', 'not', 'consistently', 'cutting', 'start', 'viewing', 'movie', 'thinking', 'what', 'want', ""'ll"", 'be', 'disappointed.But', 'go', 'watching', 'movie', 'thinking', 'what', 'title', 'about', 'American', 'Dream', 'z', ""'ll"", 'really', 'enjoy', 'have', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'playing', 'Simon', 'Cowell', 'character', 'who', 'already', 'dream', 'big', 'ratings', 'big', 'show', 'yet', 'same', 'time', 'have', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'character', 'Sally', 'Kendoo', 'who', 'basically', 'big', 'time', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'get', 'just', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'character', 'why', 'Hugh', 'character', 'obsessed', 'relentlessness', 'Then', 'loveable', 'contestant', 'Omar', 'who', 'joined', 'terror', 'cell', 'mother', 'was', 'killed', 'American', 'bomb', 'who', 'really', 'sing', 'show', 'tunes', 'music', 'used', 'share', 'soldier-boyfriend', 'Sally', 'Kendoo', 'who', 'dream', 'marriage', 'nice', 'beautiful', 'girl-next-door', 'Sally', ""n't"", 'really', 'exist', 'then', 'President', 'middle', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'dream', 'be', 'able', 'say', 'what', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'not', 'what', 'adviser', 'telling', 'say', 'thematically', 'how', 'hang', 'together', 'think', 'think', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'irrational', 'expectations', 'satire', ""'ll"", 'see', 'how', 'great', 'enjoy', 'it.The', 'performances', 'are', 'spot-on', 'board', 'enjoyed', 'even', 'politically', 'conservative', 'non-American-Idol', 'watcher', 'Unusually', 'comedy', 'not', 'have', 'categorically', 'happy', 'go', 'lucky', 'ending', 'reason', 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'originality', 'probably', 'more', 'fair', 'assign', 'four', 'stars', 'substance']",N/A

643594,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JOX3,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 0]","Paul Weitz' ""American Dreamz"" is so completely ""out there"" in both concept and execution that one can't help but give it the benefit of the doubt even when it's not always succeeding in what it's trying to do. I mean, how many comedies have the chutzpah to feature an al Qaeda terrorist cell plotting to assassinate the President of the United States on a live TV variety show modeled on ""American Idol""? And where else will you find the suave Hugh Grant playing against type as a smarmy, ego-driven Simon Cowell wannabe, Sam Golzari as an Arab suicide bomber with a passion for Broadway musicals, or Dennis Quaid as a dim bulb chief executive (based on guess who) who becomes a guest host on a television talent show in an attempt to resurrect his image with a celebrity-obsessed American public? For sheer ingenuity and audacity alone, ""American Dreamz"" far exceeds what normally passes for comedy in the multiplexes these days.Plowing much of the same territory familiar to us from last year's ""Little Miss Sunshine"" - namely, Middle America's fixation with performing and celebrity - ""American Dreamz"" is so good-natured in its attitude and tone that it's hard to be offended by its frivolous treatment of a serious subject or its occasional lapses into the overdrawn or the obvious. The sly, clever screenplay makes fun of its characters while, at the same time, treating them with affection and respect. The George Bush parody becomes a trifle obvious and heavy-handed at times, but, for the most part, the movie doesn't push too hard to get its laughs. It may bite off a bit more than it can chew, but at least it's willing to take a few risks and not always play it safe as most movies do. And for once, thanks to the breeziness of the writing, directing and acting, and its refusal to take itself too seriously, we have a ""feel-good"" movie that actually makes us feel good.Beyond Grant, Golzari and Quaid, the movie is filled with truly inspired comic performances by Mandy Moore as a not-quite-as-shallow-as-she-appears-to-be, aspiring singer; Jennifer Coolidge as her show business mother maniacally spurring her daughter on to dreams of fame and fortune; Seth Meyers as her sleazy agent quick to exploit any opportunity for publicity purposes; Chris Klein as her nave, sweet-natured boyfriend whose romantic declarations have the opposite effect of driving his true love further and further away from him; Tony Yalda as a flamboyant performer with dreams of making it big in the entertainment world; Willem Dafoe as a Machiavellian Karl Rove-type presidential adviser who literally plants a bug in the President's ear as a way of controlling his every move; Marcia Gay Harden as the President's wife who has her own methods for getting her man to do what she thinks ought to be done; and Shohreh Aghdashloo (so brilliant in ""The House of Sand and Fog"") as the perpetually optimistic aunt of the high-stepping, albeit reluctant suicide bomber commandeered by his fellow terrorists to take out the President (as well as himself). Without exception, all these actors more than know what their characters are about, so that we don't have to worry that the comedy is going to veer over the edge or lose sight of its mission or goal (as evidenced by its surprisingly uncompromised and uncompromising ending).Underrated and neglected at the time of its release, ""American Dreamz"" is a gentle little satire that will tickle your funny bone while showing you a thing or two about life in this great, big, glorious, and crazy place we call America.",4,gutsy little satire,1177027200,"04 20, 2007",2007,3550,"['Paul', 'Weitz', 'American', 'Dreamz', 'so', 'completely', 'there', 'concept', 'execution', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'give', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'even', 'when', 'not', 'always', 'succeeding', 'what', 'trying', 'do', 'mean', 'how', 'many', 'comedies', 'have', 'chutzpah', 'feature', 'al', 'Qaeda', 'terrorist', 'cell', 'plotting', 'assassinate', 'President', 'United', 'States', 'live', 'TV', 'variety', 'show', 'modeled', 'American', 'Idol', 'where', 'else', 'will', 'find', 'suave', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'playing', 'type', 'smarmy', 'ego-driven', 'Simon', 'Cowell', 'wannabe', 'Sam', 'Golzari', 'Arab', 'suicide', 'bomber', 'passion', 'Broadway', 'musicals', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'dim', 'bulb', 'chief', 'executive', 'based', 'guess', 'who', 'who', 'guest', 'host', 'television', 'talent', 'show', 'attempt', 'resurrect', 'image', 'celebrity-obsessed', 'American', 'public', 'sheer', 'ingenuity', 'audacity', 'alone', 'American', 'Dreamz', 'far', 'what', 'normally', 'comedy', 'multiplexes', 'days.Plowing', 'much', 'same', 'territory', 'familiar', 'last', 'year', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'namely', 'Middle', 'America', 'fixation', 'performing', 'celebrity', 'American', 'Dreamz', 'so', 'good-natured', 'attitude', 'tone', 'hard', 'be', 'offended', 'frivolous', 'treatment', 'serious', 'subject', 'occasional', 'lapses', 'overdrawn', 'obvious', 'sly', 'clever', 'screenplay', 'fun', 'characters', 'same', 'time', 'treating', 'affection', 'respect', 'George', 'Bush', 'parody', 'trifle', 'obvious', 'heavy-handed', 'times', 'most', 'part', 'movie', ""n't"", 'push', 'too', 'hard', 'get', 'laughs', 'may', 'bite', 'off', 'bit', 'more', 'can', 'chew', 'least', 'willing', 'take', 'few', 'risks', 'not', 'always', 'play', 'safe', 'most', 'movies', 'do', 'once', 'thanks', 'breeziness', 'writing', 'directing', 'acting', 'refusal', 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'have', 'feel-good', 'movie', 'actually', 'feel', 'good.Beyond', 'Grant', 'Golzari', 'Quaid', 'movie', 'filled', 'truly', 'inspired', 'comic', 'performances', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'not-quite-as-shallow-as-she-appears-to-be', 'aspiring', 'singer', 'Jennifer', 'Coolidge', 'show', 'business', 'mother', 'maniacally', 'spurring', 'daughter', 'dreams', 'fame', 'fortune', 'Seth', 'Meyers', 'sleazy', 'agent', 'quick', 'exploit', 'opportunity', 'publicity', 'purposes', 'Chris', 'Klein', 'nave', 'sweet-natured', 'boyfriend', 'romantic', 'declarations', 'have', 'opposite', 'effect', 'driving', 'true', 'love', 'further', 'further', 'away', 'Tony', 'Yalda', 'flamboyant', 'performer', 'dreams', 'making', 'big', 'entertainment', 'world', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'Machiavellian', 'Karl', 'Rove-type', 'presidential', 'adviser', 'who', 'literally', 'plants', 'bug', 'President', 'ear', 'way', 'controlling', 'move', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'President', 'wife', 'who', 'own', 'methods', 'getting', 'man', 'do', 'what', 'ought', 'be', 'done', 'Shohreh', 'Aghdashloo', 'so', 'brilliant', 'House', 'Sand', 'Fog', 'perpetually', 'optimistic', 'aunt', 'high-stepping', 'reluctant', 'suicide', 'bomber', 'commandeered', 'fellow', 'terrorists', 'take', 'out', 'President', 'as', 'well', 'exception', 'actors', 'more', 'know', 'what', 'characters', 'are', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'worry', 'comedy', 'going', 'veer', 'edge', 'lose', 'sight', 'mission', 'goal', 'evidenced', 'surprisingly', 'uncompromised', 'uncompromising', 'ending', '.Underrated', 'neglected', 'time', 'release', 'American', 'Dreamz', 'gentle', 'little', 'satire', 'will', 'tickle', 'funny', 'bone', 'showing', 'thing', 'two', 'life', 'great', 'big', 'glorious', 'crazy', 'place', 'call', 'America']",N/A

In other words, the woman is unfaithful, but was portrayed in a good light and the man is ridiculed for being upset over his partner's infidelity! How ridiculous is this?3) The portrayal of the Arab guy and his colleagues was the most reprehensible part of the film. First of all the Arab guy who is more western friendly is portrayed as lighter coloured, more camp (yes, they use 'campness' to signify western culture v. Arab culture) than the others. His colleagues who want him to carry out the suicide bombings are portrayed as more obviously Arab with beards, stronger accents, less western clothes and a backward mentality. The battle is basically portrayed as a western culture v Arab culture battle for the mind of Omar (the camp Arab guy). The Arab 'culture' is represented by suicide bombers. Of course, the western culture wins.The film is dumb pathetic film and a (very small) part of the propaganda war that allows western governments to get away with the murder of so many Sunnis, Shias because they 'are all suicide bombers' who 'hate the west' and want to 'stop all of our liberties'.

643597,A1MZNOE1OABAQK,B00005JOX3,thecableguy,"[1, 3]","""American Dreamz"" isn't acidic enough to serve as satire, and lacks the extra details needed to provide any more dimension than what you see on ""American Idol,"" so why bother watching?Maybe writer/producer/director Paul Weitz (""About a Boy"" ""In Good Company"" Mike White's love interest in ""Chuck and Buck"") was wrestling with the same question, and decided to add Dennis Quaid as a George W-esque President named Joseph Staton (phonetically one letter away from the Russian dictator -- hardy har) and Willem Dafoe as the Cheney lookalike puppet master, who books Staton as a judge on ""American Dreamz,"" the most popular show in the country, to help boost approval ratings.Unfortunately, Omer (Sam Golzari), one of the contestants who winds up on the show (via ridiculous happenstance) belongs to a terrorist sleeper cell, and is given orders to blow up Staton with a bomb made from bubblegum. Fortunately, Omer is having second thoughts, since he really loves American show tunes -- while training in Afghanistan, he secretly repeatedly listened to his mother's LP of ""A Chorus Line"" until his commanding officer caught him and broke it.Meanwhile, Omer's chief competition, Sally Kendoo (Mandy Moore) is getting close to the show's host Martin Tweed (Hugh Grant, who did George W. much better service propaganda-wise in 2002's ""Two Weeks Notice"") They're the film's hollowest, least interesting characters, and their burgeoning romance is given the most screen time.Sally and Martin's relationship is also bad for William Williams, Sally's Army boyfriend (played by Chris Klein).  William is planning to propose to her on the show.  Sally only kept William around because he was wounded in Iraq, and was told it would improve her chances of winning. Trouble lies ahead.Then there's the other plotline involving the President, which was probably intended as the film's crux, but comes off like a lazy afterthought to tidy up this whole mess.Weitz seems like he's too scared to completely lampoon the administration (or even ""American Idol"" for that matter.)  Perhaps he was hired to do the opposite, and didn't have the conviction to pull it off.  So ""American Dreamz"" winds up in the middle of the road -- just when Quaid goes over-the-top satirizing the President's intelligence, (Clinton gets ""Primary Colors,"" Bush gets ""Primary School,"" I thought), Weitz reins him in, wimps out, and tries to convince the audience the President is just a misunderstood teddy bear. It's an insult to anyone, Democrat or Republican, Country or Westerner.So instead of ""Amercian Dreamz"" for media satire, rent ""Network"" or ""Wag the Dog"" or anything for that matter.  Heck, even ""Drop Dead Gorgeous"" was better than this.  Come to think of it, ""Dreamz"" would've been a whole lot better if Mandy Moore's head would've turned into a giant cobra head during the finals, after which she could've been Omer-ized.",1,The Sum of All Jeers,1169942400,"01 28, 2007",2007,2891,"['American', 'Dreamz', ""n't"", 'acidic', 'enough', 'serve', 'satire', 'extra', 'details', 'needed', 'provide', 'more', 'dimension', 'what', 'see', 'American', 'Idol', 'so', 'why', 'bother', 'watching', 'Maybe', 'writer/producer/director', 'Paul', 'Weitz', 'Boy', 'Good', 'Company', 'Mike', 'White', 'love', 'interest', 'Chuck', 'Buck', 'was', 'wrestling', 'same', 'question', 'decided', 'add', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'George', 'W-esque', 'President', 'named', 'Joseph', 'Staton', 'phonetically', 'one', 'letter', 'away', 'Russian', 'dictator', 'hardy', 'har', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'Cheney', 'lookalike', 'puppet', 'master', 'who', 'books', 'Staton', 'judge', 'American', 'Dreamz', 'most', 'popular', 'show', 'country', 'help', 'boost', 'approval', 'ratings.Unfortunately', 'Omer', 'Sam', 'Golzari', 'one', 'contestants', 'who', 'up', 'show', 'ridiculous', 'happenstance', 'terrorist', 'sleeper', 'cell', 'given', 'orders', 'blow', 'up', 'Staton', 'bomb', 'made', 'bubblegum', 'Fortunately', 'Omer', 'having', 'second', 'thoughts', 'really', 'American', 'show', 'tunes', 'training', 'Afghanistan', 'secretly', 'repeatedly', 'listened', 'mother', 'LP', 'A', 'Chorus', 'Line', 'commanding', 'officer', 'caught', 'broke', 'it.Meanwhile', 'Omer', 'chief', 'competition', 'Sally', 'Kendoo', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'getting', 'close', 'show', 'host', 'Martin', 'Tweed', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'who', 'did', 'George', 'W.', 'much', 'better', 'service', 'propaganda-wise', '2002', 'Two', 'Weeks', 'Notice', ""'re"", 'film', 'hollowest', 'least', 'interesting', 'characters', 'burgeoning', 'romance', 'given', 'most', 'screen', 'time.Sally', 'Martin', 'relationship', 'also', 'bad', 'William', 'Williams', 'Sally', 'Army', 'boyfriend', 'played', 'Chris', 'Klein', 'William', 'planning', 'propose', 'show', 'Sally', 'only', 'kept', 'William', 'was', 'wounded', 'Iraq', 'was', 'told', 'would', 'improve', 'chances', 'winning', 'Trouble', 'ahead.Then', 'other', 'plotline', 'involving', 'President', 'was', 'probably', 'intended', 'film', 'crux', 'off', 'lazy', 'afterthought', 'tidy', 'up', 'whole', 'mess.Weitz', 'too', 'scared', 'completely', 'lampoon', 'administration', 'even', 'American', 'Idol', 'matter', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'hired', 'do', 'opposite', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'conviction', 'pull', 'off', 'So', 'American', 'Dreamz', 'up', 'middle', 'road', 'just', 'when', 'Quaid', 'over-the-top', 'satirizing', 'President', 'intelligence', 'Clinton', 'Primary', 'Colors', 'Bush', 'Primary', 'School', 'thought', 'Weitz', 'wimps', 'out', 'tries', 'convince', 'audience', 'President', 'just', 'misunderstood', 'teddy', 'bear', 'insult', 'anyone', 'Democrat', 'Republican', 'Country', 'Westerner.So', 'instead', 'Amercian', 'Dreamz', 'media', 'satire', 'rent', 'Network', 'Dog', 'anything', 'matter', 'Heck', 'even', 'Drop', 'Dead', 'Gorgeous', 'was', 'better', 'Come', 'think', 'Dreamz', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'whole', 'lot', 'better', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'head', 'would', ""'ve"", 'turned', 'giant', 'cobra', 'head', 'finals', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'Omer-ized']",N/A
643598,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00005JOX3,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[13, 20]","""American Dreamz"", the new film from writer-director Paul Weitz (director of ""American Pie"", ""About a Boy"") showed promise as an interesting, funny, unusual satire on American pop culture. It isn't. It may be one of the most disappointing films released this year.Martin Tweed (Hugh Grant), a conceited, rich and hugely popular producer and host of the most popular show in America, ""American Dreamz"", a weekly show showcasing amateur singers who want to become the next musical superstar, is at a crossroads in his life. After each performance, Tweed either gives them praise or eviscerates them with harsh criticism. Then the public votes and the people with the most votes move on to the next week. Tweed demands that his producers find a more diverse talent pool, including a Jewish and an Arab contestant, to help liven up this season. President Staton (Dennis Quaid), having just won re-election, decides to read a newspaper. He is shocked to read of all of the problems in the world. His Chief of Staff (Willem Dafoe) panics and tries to get the President to continue to receive his briefings, but the President holes himself up, staying out of the public eye, for three weeks reading anything and everything he can. The public begins to wonder if the President has gone insane prompting the Chief of Staff to arrange a series of public appearances, everything from a `meet and greet' with Carmen Electra to becoming a guest judge on the season finale of ""American Dreamz"". Sally Kendoo (Mandy Moore) is a middle class girl from Ohio who is picked to appear on the show. She is so sure that she will become a star she dumps her long time boyfriend William Williams (Chris Klein) who promptly enlists in the army, arrives in Iraq, is shot and returns home, all in the space of two weeks. Omer (Sam Golzari), an inept terrorist, is banished from the terrorist training camp and sent to Orange County to live with an aunt and uncle. Omer is to live like a normal person and wait for the call to action. His gay cousin, Iqbal (Tony Yalda) has erected a huge stage in the basement of their home and applied to be on ""American Dreamz"". One day, Omer is performing ""Luck Be a Lady"" on the stage when producers from ""American Dreamz"" arrive, looking for Iqbal, and ask him to participate.Normally, such a convoluted synopsis would almost guarantee that I would at least like the film. And this synopsis only scratches the surface. A film with so many stories, with so much going on, is at least going to keep you interested. Right? Wrong. Only one of the characters is likable or interesting and this creates a sort of vacuum, draining everything of life. As we watch all of these characters moving through the stories, we become bored. Yes, they are doing things. But we don't really care because we have no feelings for any of the characters. Even bad characters can be interesting, causing us to have some feelings about what they are doing.On more than one occasion, characters exchange dialogue and then stop, pausing, before continuing. This is the equivalent of two actors on stage who are engaged in witty banter and then laughter and applause from the audience cause them to stop, so no one will miss a word. In a film you can't do this. The best, funniest films are the films we laugh through 50% of the jokes. When we do this, we might go to see the film again, or rent it on DVD, catching the remainder of the laughs. When you do this in film, it becomes the equivalent of watching a bad comedian doing stand up. Every time he tells a joke, he waits for the laughter. If there are laughs, he stops and waits before continuing. In ""Dreamz"", there aren't that many laughs.A satire shouldn't be easy and it should take us to places we never expected. In ""Dreamz"", all of the subject matter is far too easy. It is like watching an extended ""Saturday Night Live"" skit. Hugh Grant playing a Simon Cowell rip off. Okay, that's amusing. But when his character doesn't do anything new or unusual, it becomes boring. From his television persona, we might expect Simon Cowell-like Martin Tweed to be self-obsessed, full of his stardom and dating young girls. But what could Grant and director Weitz have done with the character that we wouldn't expect? A lot, but it isn't on the screen. Quaid plays a Bush-like President. His father was President, he is from the South, he speaks with platitudes. Not a far stretch. And certainly a subject ripe for parody. But ""Saturday Night Live"" does a better job of lampooning the President on a weekly basis. The President doesn't know that there are three different types of Iraqis. Ha-ha-ha. Again, so much could've been done that isn't even attempted. Did the writer-director get lazy?Mandy Moore plays a stardom obsessed young teenage girl. Clearly, she is supposed to be a cross of Kelly Clarkson and Britney Spears. There are some funny ideas and jokes here, about Spears, how fame changes you, etc. But her character changes her mind every few seconds and it becomes inconsistent and ultimately boring as well. We get it. She is so obsessed with fame, willing to do anything. Yes, we get it.The one standout in the cast is Sam Golzari. From the moment we first meet him at the Terrorist Training Camp (and we see they are shooting a recruitment video, a nice touch) and he starts singing along to a record of show tunes, we realize this character is something unusual and strange. As soon as he arrives in Orange County and starts interacting with his aunt and uncle and two cousins, we begin to get a glimpse of what this film could've been. The two cousins are clearly changed by live in an affluent community in Orange County. They take Omer to the mall. His aunt says ""Maybe we should get Omer his own credit card?"" His uncle replies ""Sure, why not."" The two cousins are clearly spoiled and their parents eat it up. This is the American Dream, to come to this country and provide a better lifestyle for your children. Many may not see their lifestyle as better, but it is for these people.After Omer becomes a hit on ""American Dreamz"" and the terrorists approach him with their plan, he begins to have second thoughts. He is living his dream, performing songs on a television show (which is watched at the Terrorist Camp, thanks to satellite and TIVO) and isn't sure he has the heart to go through with the plan.""American Dreamz"" held a lot of promise. But the promise isn't fulfilled. Because many of the jokes fall flat and the parody isn't at the level we would hope, the film seems a lot longer than it actually is. Not good when we are watching a comedy.",2,"Not Our ""American Dreamz""",1145750400,"04 23, 2006",2006,6610,"['American', 'Dreamz', 'new', 'film', 'writer-director', 'Paul', 'Weitz', 'director',

Surprisingly, that doesn't stop them from being funny.Here's the basic plot: The morning after winning reelection Dennis Quaid's version of George W. Bush decides that he's going to start reading the newspapers. When he realizes how much he doesn't know and how much his ""intelligence reports"" leave out he goes into seclusion, telling Willem Dafoe's Karl Rove/Dick Cheney hybrid: ""Iran and North Korea are NOT like Magneto and Dr. Octopus!""Meanwhile, a new season of the extremely popular reality show American Dreamz has begun, and the host (Hugh Grant's acerbic version of Simon Cowell), wants it to be more interesting, so he searches for an Arab and a Jew to put into the competition. Mandy Moore's combination of Carrie Underwood and every other marginally talented singer who's been on a reality show, is also part of the competition.The President needs to get his approval ratings back up so he signs on to be a guest host of the show.There you go. There are some pretty solid laughs throughout, and the movie never tries to take itself too seriously which helps to keep it rolling. In the end, there may be too many characters and too many plot points for the story to really be cohesive, but it's not the kind of movie audiences are expecting to really learn something from anyway.In the opening scene, Hugh Grant tells his girlfriend. ""You make me want to be a better man. But I'm not a better man. I'm me."" This movie has the same unapologetic attitude. ""You make me want to be a better movie. But I'm not a better movie. I'm American Dreamz."" And that's okay.",3,American Dreamz...
