1683406,A2J85OEP6FPG69,B00H1RMPH6,"Ricardo Salas ""sales67""","[0, 0]","First, the acting was subpar & unrealistic. I hated the Canicas (the best buddy) character who was the Mexican Steppin Fetchin. The main lady in the film was skeleton skinny, had minimal charisma & NO sex appeal. The main guy (Mariachi), couldn't even fake being able to play the guitar though the music was OK & the voice was nice. His daughter looked horrible (couldn't they have found a semi-attractive kid?). The only redeeming quality was the music but you could go out & buy a CD of Mexican music rather than waste your time with these characters.So if you enjoy watching inferior acting, stereotypical side-kicks, and weakling henchmen who couldn't win a fight with a fly, then be my guest and watch this waste of someone's time.",1,Worse than a B Movie,1397174400,"04 11, 2014",2014,736,"['First', 'acting', 'was', 'subpar', 'unrealistic', 'hated', 'Canicas', 'best', 'buddy', 'character', 'who', 'was', 'Mexican', 'Steppin', 'Fetchin', 'main', 'lady', 'film', 'was', 'skeleton', 'skinny', 'had', 'minimal', 'charisma', 'NO', 'sex', 'appeal', 'main', 'guy', 'Mariachi', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'fake', 'being', 'able', 'play', 'guitar', 'music', 'was', 'OK', 'voice', 'was', 'nice', 'daughter', 'looked', 'horrible', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'found', 'semi-attractive', 'kid', 'only', 'redeeming', 'quality', 'was', 'music', 'could', 'go', 'out', 'buy', 'CD', 'Mexican', 'music', 'rather', 'waste', 'time', 'characters.So', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'inferior', 'acting', 'stereotypical', 'side-kicks', 'weakling', 'henchmen', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'win', 'fight', 'fly', 'then', 'be', 'guest', 'watch', 'waste', 'someone', 'time']",Pulling Strings Digital
1683407,A2IQAEMUP0YP49,B00H1RMPH6,Ron,"[2, 2]","Like me, there are many people who buy DVDs completely blind not knowing a thing about the movie. Just one more to add to their collection of movies. I LOVE MOVIES. I find them entertaining, therapeutic, educational etc.If you search for the trailer on youtube, youre going to find so many negative and racist comments down on the comment section. Please, and I REALLY add emphasis on that &#34;please&#34;, dont let it cloud your judgement. This movie deserves to be watched and have your personal review and opinion on it.This movie falls under the romantic comedy but there is more to it than another love story. It adds depth by adding culture, music, adventure, a journey that not only makes the characters find each other, but find themselves. I personally have a selective few of &#34;go to&#34; that i never get tired of that i usually pop in after a long stressful day and this is definitely being added to my favorites. I never knew Jaime Camil knew english and watching him speak fluently was brilliant. Laura Ramsey is more than just eye candy for the male viewers, she really represents a smart, strong, independent individual who is stunning in every scene. Even in the scenes where shes hungover lol. The supporting characters are also colorful like Canicas. I didnt find him annoying or felt like he was overdoing the comedic act. Like he said in the featurette, every person has a canicas in their life. Hes a loyal, funny guy who you just cant get enough of.This movie is in bilingual meaning spanish and english are used but the subtitles are very accurate. There is nothing racist about this movie, its a colorful flick that isnt made for oscars or any awards whatsoever, It is a great addition to Cine Mexicano and made to just have a good time.Give it a try, I love it, hopefully you do too.",5,For an accuracy read my review!,1400803200,"05 23, 2014",2014,1813,"['are', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'buy', 'DVDs', 'completely', 'not', 'knowing', 'thing', 'movie', 'Just', 'one', 'more', 'add', 'collection', 'movies', 'LOVE', 'MOVIES', 'find', 'entertaining', 'therapeutic', 'educational', 'etc.If', 'search', 'trailer', 'youtube', 'youre', 'going', 'find', 'so', 'many', 'negative', 'racist', 'comments', 'down', 'comment', 'section', 'Please', 'REALLY', 'add', 'emphasis', '34', 'please', '34', 'let', 'cloud', 'judgement', 'movie', 'be', 'watched', 'have', 'personal', 'review', 'opinion', 'it.This', 'movie', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'more', 'love', 'story', 'depth', 'adding', 'culture', 'music', 'adventure', 'journey', 'not', 'only', 'characters', 'find', 'other', 'find', 'personally', 'have', 'selective', 'few', '34', 'go', '34', 'never', 'get', 'tired', 'i', 'usually', 'pop', 'long', 'stressful', 'day', 'definitely', 'being', 'added', 'favorites', 'never', 'knew', 'Jaime', 'Camil', 'knew', 'english', 'watching', 'speak', 'fluently', 'was', 'brilliant', 'Laura', 'Ramsey', 'more', 'just', 'eye', 'candy', 'male', 'viewers', 'really', 'smart', 'strong', 'independent', 'individual', 'who', 'stunning', 'scene', 'Even', 'scenes', 'where', 'shes', 'hungover', 'lol', 'supporting', 'characters', 'are', 'also', 'colorful', 'Canicas', 'didnt', 'find', 'annoying', 'felt', 'was', 'overdoing', 'comedic', 'act', 'said', 'featurette', 'person', 'canicas', 'life', 'Hes', 'loyal', 'funny', 'guy', 'who', 'just', 'cant', 'get', 'enough', 'of.This', 'movie', 'bilingual', 'meaning', 'spanish', 'english', 'are', 'used', 'subtitles', 'are', 'very', 'accurate', 'nothing', 'racist', 'movie', 'colorful', 'flick', 'made', 'oscars', 'awards', 'whatsoever', 'great', 'addition', 'Cine', 'Mexicano', 'made', 'just', 'have', 'good', 'time.Give', 'try', 'love', 'hopefully', 'do', 'too']",Pulling Strings Digital
