Mary's character grows from being a naive housewife to a successful career woman. My thought was that it was sort of watching Laurie Petrie (Mary's character on the Dick Van Dyke show) evolve into Mary Richards. Christine's character made me think somewhat of Rhoda Morgenstern in terms of being a bit jaded about life and about finding a relationship. This is not a movie that would change anybody's life.

The clothes are hilarious but not as much as the big hairstyles.  Hilarious.  But move beyond the opening drawn out areobics class and a very entertaining weepy drama will draw you in.Mary Tyler Moore, a housewife meets Christine Lahti, a newsreporter in an aerobics class and they form an instant bond both not having many female friends.  Ms. Moore is happily married and lo and behold it ends up Ms. Lahti is having an affair with a married man who is Ms. Moore's husband.How this drama plays out and how the plot develops is very well done and certainly character driven.  The acting is superb all around but for me watching the movie 22 years after it was made I am most impressed with Mary Tyler Moore.  If this situation happened today the people involved would most certainly be in different places and deal with things a little differently.Mary Tyler Moore makes her somewhat timid housewife who yearns for more very believable and the journey of self discovery she embarks on is very well told.  It also provides Ms. Moore wirth some excellent scenes.  She truly becomes this character and her emotions are believably raw.  She makes the otherwise datedness of this movie not an issue.  Her character is timeless and you believe she could be from this generation and going through the same processes.Give yourself a treat and enjoy this quality emotional drama.",4,Mary Tyler Moore is Superb,1221350400,"09 14, 2008",2008,1460,"['Boy', 'movie', 'place', '80', 'first', 'must', 'get', 'how', 'dated', 'clothes', 'are', 'hilarious', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'big', 'hairstyles', 'Hilarious', 'move', 'opening', 'drawn', 'areobics', 'class', 'very', 'entertaining', 'weepy', 'drama', 'will', 'draw', 'in.Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'housewife', 'meets', 'Christine', 'Lahti', 'newsreporter', 'aerobics', 'class', 'form', 'instant', 'bond', 'not', 'having', 'many', 'female', 'friends', 'Ms.', 'Moore', 'happily', 'married', 'lo', 'behold', 'up', 'Ms.', 'Lahti', 'having', 'affair', 'married', 'man', 'who', 'Ms.', 'Moore', 'husband.How', 'drama', 'out', 'how', 'plot', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'certainly', 'character', 'driven', 'acting', 'superb', 'around', 'watching', 'movie', '22', 'years', 'was', 'made', 'am', 'most', 'impressed', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'situation', 'happened', 'today', 'people', 'involved', 'would', 'most', 'certainly', 'be', 'different', 'places', 'deal', 'things', 'little', 'differently.Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'somewhat', 'timid', 'housewife', 'who', 'more', 'very', 'believable', 'journey', 'self', 'discovery', 'very', 'well', 'told', 'also', 'Ms.', 'Moore', 'wirth', 'excellent', 'scenes', 'truly', 'character', 'emotions', 'are', 'believably', 'raw', 'otherwise', 'datedness', 'movie', 'not', 'issue', 'character', 'timeless', 'believe', 'could', 'be', 'generation', 'going', 'same', 'processes.Give', 'treat', 'enjoy', 'quality', 'emotional', 'drama']",N/A
