This is a story about a young lion king whose father is the King of the Pride Land. His father teaches him that all of the past kings are alway watching over them from the heavens as Gods that guide them in the right direction. Simba learns about the circle of life and how when we die we become apart of the earth and us dying lets others live generation after generation. It's Simba's uncle Scar who when tryin to take over the Kingdom tricks Simba into believing that he killer his own father and that their herd or tribe will hate him and want to kill him so Scar tells Simba to run away and never to return.

Simba's father dies in Lion King.  Bambi's mother dies in Bambi.  Bambi returns to take his father's place as ruler.  Simba does the same thing.  But on second glance, there is much more here than Bambi.  Bambi only has the motivation to return because of his girlfriend, Faline.  Simba, however, has Nala - and the revenge he eventually takes on Scar for killing his father.  Simba thus has a deeper, more well developed character than Bambi.  The music is very good and compliments the movie well.  Simba starts as wanting to be king, then is forced out of the role by Scar, then is placed back into it by Nala and Rafiki.  This gives him a much more complex character than Bambi.

Who would have known that it will become the highest grossing tradional animated film of all time? Who would have known it would win two oscars and three golden globes? Even more important, who would have known than this supposedly secondary project will become one of Disney's most treasured films and the epitome of the Disney Renaissance? Well that's because The Lion King is not your usual regular animated film. It's one of the best animated films ever made with a complex and great story, unforgettable characters, a superb score and great music that elevates it and proudly stands with the best films ever made.I got to know the movie in my chiildhood when I was 4 years old and since then, The Lion King has been one of my favorite films. From its glourious beginning (which by the way I think is the best opening ever) to its final battle and resolution, the movie provides top-notch entertainment to everyone. The characters are great and stays with you and the film showcases one of the best villains that had graced the screen. Hans Zimmer score aided by Lebo M., is amazing, it just envelops you in the film's atmosphere and never let you go until the magnificent finale.Finally, this classic has made its long awaited Blu-ray debut in Disney's premium Diamond Line and the results are spectacular!!Video & AudioWOW!! The Lion King looks absolutely breathtaking on HD. The transfer is immaculate with vivid colors, strong detail and amazing contrast. You will be amazed by how clear is the image and you'll discover new things that you have never seen.The 7.1 DTS-HD MA is as strong and superb as its video counterpart. The sound is bombastic and really strong. Dialogue is clear and wait 'till you see the opening scene and you will be completely in awe. An amazing audio presentation.Bonus FeaturesWhile this set is not as loaded as previous Diamond films like Beauty or Sniw White, there are still plenty of interesting stuff to watch.""Disney Second Screen"" allows you to sync the film with your ipad or laptop in order to see galleries, games, storyboards and more. While this is nice is does not work as good as it sounds.You also have an audiocommentary with producer Don Hahn and directors Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff which is interesting to watch.""Pride of The Lion King"", which is the best bonus in this set, is a retrospective documentary about the production of the film. Many of the people involved share their thoughts of what the film meant to them and also how thd Broadway musical came to be. A must see!!""The Lion King: A memoir- Don Hahn"" Is a retrospective look by the producer whonlooks back at him in 1994 and how The Lion King came to be. Another must-see!!""Deleted and alternate scenes"" feature five deleted scenes introduced by the directors.""The Morning Report"" is a fully animated scene that was inserted in the film in the Platinum DVD but it now appears on its own. I think that is good because I did not like it at all.""Bloopers & Outtakes"" is a newly-created setof bloopers featuring the characters evocating the Pixar films. While this are funny, they are not as funny as the Pixar ones.""Interactive Art Gallery"" is a great compilation of character design images, storyboards, development, etc.""Sing along mode"" is the usual karaoke-like feature where you can sing the film songs.""Disney's Virtual Vault"" is the highly impractical online feature that houses all the material from the Platinum DVD. At least they included the material.This set is the two disc BD/DVD combo which I think is the ideal release without paying for a gimmicky format and a pointless conversion.A DVD copy is also included.Closing ThoughtsThe Lion King is a masterpiece and one of the best animated films ever made. Dealing with themes like death, loss, guilt, responsibility, love, family and more, this film stands tall as one of Disney's best films.

Taylor ""GFT""","[3, 6]","Disney Studios tends to use the word &quot;classic&quot; to describe every film it releases--but in the case of THE LION KING, the word is very apt.  And this double disk DVD &quot;Special Platinum Edition&quot; shows the film at its best.Unlike the recent DVD release of SLEEPING BEAUTY, THE LION KING did not require significant restoration, and if you have a VHS copy of a previous release you will not find the picture significantly different beyond the inclusion of a new musical number.  What you will find quite different, however, is the sound. The DVD offers you the option of the original soundtrack as it was first created for theatrical release or a home theatre mix--and if you have a surround sound system, the latter will add a great deal to your viewing experience.As usual in Disney's &quot;special&quot; releases, THE LION KING also comes with a great many bonuses.  I found them a mixed bag; at times they were little more than shamless self-promotion on the part of Disney, and they also tended to be repetitive.  But the bonuses do include a very nice audio commentary track and a number of fascinating interviews and short documentaries that will interest Disney fans, and there are several games (which can be played from the DVD remote control) that the kids will enjoy quite a bit.But the real power of this DVD release is, of course, the film itself.  Loosely suggested by everything from Biblical parables to African folktales to Shakespeare's HAMLET, THE LION KING presents us with a moral lesson about responsibility, courage and the need to confront past mistakes--precisely the sort of thing that you WANT your kids to watch but they always object to sitting through.  But they won't object to it this time: the film looks beautiful, it sounds great, and with its pagent of heroes and bad guys, comic characters, low comedy, and high drama it should hold them (and adults as well) glued to the screen.If you're not greatly interested in bonus materials or in the surround sound features and you already have a good quality copy of THE LION KING in your collection--you may want to give this new edition a miss.  But if you're a first time buyer or you're replacing a worn-out-from-viewing copy, this release is the way to go.--GFT (Amazon.com Reviewer)--",5,"A True Classic in a New, Double DVD Edition",1063670400,"09 16, 2003",2003,2285,"['Disney', 'Studios', 'use', 'word', 'quot', 'classic', 'quot', 'describe', 'film', 'case', 'THE', 'LION', 'KING', 'word', 'very', 'apt', 'double', 'disk', 'DVD', 'quot', 'Special', 'Platinum', 'Edition', 'quot', 'film', 'best.Unlike', 'recent', 'DVD', 'release', 'SLEEPING', 'BEAUTY', 'THE', 'LION', 'KING', 'did', 'not', 'require', 'significant', 'restoration', 'have', 'VHS', 'copy', 'previous', 'release', 'will', 'not', 'find', 'picture', 'significantly', 'different', 'inclusion', 'new', 'musical', 'number', 'What', 'will', 'find', 'quite', 'different', 'however', 'sound', 'DVD', 'option', 'original', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'first', 'created', 'theatrical', 'release', 'home', 'theatre', 'mix', 'have', 'surround', 'sound', 'system', 'latter', 'will', 'add', 'great', 'deal', 'viewing', 'experience.As', 'usual', 'Disney', 'quot', 'special', 'quot', 'releases', 'LION', 'KING', 'also', 'great', 'many', 'bonuses', 'found', 'mixed', 'bag', 'times', 'were', 'little', 'more', 'shamless', 'self-promotion', 'part', 'Disney', 'also', 'tended', 'be', 'repetitive', 'bonuses', 'do', 'include', 'very', 'nice', 'audio', 'commentary', 'track', 'number', 'fascinating', 'interviews', 'short', 'documentaries', 'will', 'interest', 'Disney', 'fans', 'are', 'several', 'games', 'can', 'be', 'played', 'DVD', 'remote', 'control', 'kids', 'will', 'enjoy', 'quite', 'bit.But', 'real', 'power', 'DVD', 'release', 'course', 'film', 'Loosely', 'suggested', 'everything', 'Biblical', 'parables', 'African', 'folktales', 'Shakespeare', 'HAMLET', 'THE', 'LION', 'KING', 'presents', 'moral', 'lesson', 'responsibility', 'courage', 'need', 'confront', 'past', 'mistakes', 'precisely', 'sort', 'thing', 'WANT', 'kids', 'watch', 'always', 'object', 'sitting', 'wo', ""n't"", 'object', 'time', 'film', 'beautiful', 'great', 'pagent', 'heroes', 'bad', 'guys', 'comic', 'characters', 'low', 'comedy', 'high', 'drama', 'should', 'hold', 'adults', 'as', 'well', 'glued', 'screen.If', ""'re"", 'not', 'greatly', 'interested', 'bonus', 'materials', 'surround', 'sound', 'features', 'already', 'have', 'good', 'quality', 'copy', 'THE', 'LION', 'KING', 'collection', 'may', 'want', 'give', 'new', 'edition', 'miss', ""'re"", 'first', 'time', 'buyer', ""'re"", 'replacing', 'worn-out-from-viewing', 'copy', 'release', 'way', 'go.', 'GFT', 'Amazon.com', 'Reviewer']",N/A

As you can see, this was a long time ago. Between then and now, we have moved twice and between the first change of house, the VHS was lost. My father and I were devistated. Luckily, DVD's were bearly being released and so, my father bought me a dvd for my room along with a copy of this movie. When he would come home from his first job, we would sit in the couch and watch the Lion King and laugh/ imitate the hyenas all night long. Fate once more frowned upon my family and once more we had to move. During this move, the DVD was broken in half and scratched by a lovely car. It passed unnoticed. I had also grown into those teenage years where rebellion was &#34;in&#34; and so, I didn't care weather we had this movie anymore or not. My father began working double shifts to support our family and well, our relationship grew thin. Ya know, the whole &#34;I only saw him for 30 minutes every other day&#34; kinda thing. And that went on for a long time. I graduated Highschool and started college and still, our relationship remained the same. That is, untill one thanksgiving eivning we sat down in the same couch, in the same position, and turned on the tv to see (yeah you guessed it) The Lion King.Lets just say, I took a second to notice what was happening around me. My pops started snoring cause he was tired. The once Dark brown fluffy hair  was now a wisp of grey and brown poofyness on top of his head. I no longer fit snuggly between his arm, and he no longer was able to walk me on top of his feet. I got a little sentimental and looked away but that old man got me... He just said &#34;MUFASA&#34; in the loudest possible way and I once more knew that my father, my Mufasa, had returned. &#34;OH IT TINGLES&#34; was all that i replied and for that night, I was 5 years old again.You don't really need me to Review this movie, you have seen it before. We all know how a great movie it is. If you are buying it, You possibly have a story like this to tell. I'm thankful for you reaching this far, but this story has dragged on long enough.

765307,A2UBSGFCP2QFNV,B0000AOWLW,"Greg Ehrbar ""'MouseTracksOnline'""","[1, 2]","I know some might not like to hear me admit this, but the character of Simba kind of gets me annoyed in The Lion King. Yes, I know he's young and foolish at the start, but when he brags and taunts Scar, he spurs the villainous lion into his treachery. When he sings ""I Just Can't Wait to Be King,"" he's not realizing what has to happen for him to be king. When Mufasa is killed, only a moron would believe what Scar is able to convince him of. And yes, I know, that's part of the story arc -- that Simba must mature and get a clue before he is worthy of his kingdom.But the film has never fully convinced me that Simba truly reaches that point. It actually seems that Simba's ascent is more due to the efforts of Timon, Pumbaa, Rafiki, Sarabi, Nala and the ghost of Mufasa. Yet he gets to be king anyway. Maybe my perspective is tainted by some real-life business politics, but I've never been able to shake this feeling, at least until The Lion King 1 1/2, when Simba actually acknowledges and thanks Timon and Pumbaa. (The Broadway show also was able to allow Simba's character more introspection that isn't possible in the format of an animated film.)Don't get me wrong. The Lion King is a masterwork and a landmark Disney animated film, a perfect storm of talent and artistry that continues to command awe from the public, even recently in its 3-D release.What makes The Lion King even more amazing is how close it came to never happening, or at least faltering along the way. A candid, revelatory bonus feature, which is included on both the Blu-ray and the DVD (unlike the commentary and many other features which are exclusive to the Blu-ray), Producer Don Hahn narrates the story of the film from his perspective. During most of its production, The Lion King was considered ""the lesser project"" next to Pocahontas, it went through several personnel changes and backstage angst, and the filmmakers were concerned that the public would reject the movie--right up to the first release date.That's why such bonus material is so valuable and important. This knowledge serves to make me appreciate The Lion King even more, even if Simba gets my goat a little. (Of course, if really he got my goat, it would little more than a snack, wouldn't it?)",5,"Great movie, great edition, but I'm still a little ticked at Simba",1318896000,"10 18, 2011",2011,2248,"['know', 'might', 'not', 'like', 'hear', 'admit', 'character', 'Simba', 'kind', 'annoyed', 'Lion', 'King', 'Yes', 'know', 'young', 'foolish', 'start', 'when', 'taunts', 'Scar', 'villainous', 'lion', 'treachery', 'When', 'Just', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Wait', 'Be', 'King', 'not', 'realizing', 'what', 'happen', 'be', 'king', 'When', 'Mufasa', 'killed', 'only', 'moron', 'would', 'believe', 'what', 'Scar', 'able', 'convince', 'yes', 'know', 'part', 'story', 'arc', 'Simba', 'must', 'mature', 'get', 'clue', 'worthy', 'kingdom.But', 'film', 'never', 'fully', 'convinced', 'Simba', 'truly', 'point', 'actually', 'Simba', 'ascent', 'more', 'due', 'efforts', 'Timon', 'Pumbaa', 'Rafiki', 'Sarabi', 'Nala', 'ghost', 'Mufasa', 'be', 'king', 'anyway', 'Maybe', 'perspective', 'tainted', 'real-life', 'business', 'politics', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'able', 'shake', 'feeling', 'least', 'Lion', 'King', '1', '1/2', 'when', 'Simba', 'actually', 'thanks', 'Timon', 'Pumbaa', 'Broadway', 'show', 'also', 'was', 'able', 'allow', 'Simba', 'character', 'more', 'introspection', ""n't"", 'possible', 'format', 'animated', 'film', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'Lion', 'King', 'masterwork', 'landmark', 'Disney', 'animated', 'film', 'perfect', 'storm', 'talent', 'artistry', 'command', 'awe', 'public', 'even', 'recently', '3-D', 'release.What', 'Lion', 'King', 'even', 'more', 'amazing', 'how', 'close', 'came', 'never', 'happening', 'least', 'faltering', 'way', 'candid', 'revelatory', 'bonus', 'feature', 'included', 'Blu-ray', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'many', 'other', 'features', 'are', 'exclusive', 'Blu-ray', 'Producer', 'Don', 'Hahn', 'story', 'film', 'perspective', 'most', 'production', 'Lion', 'King', 'was', 'considered', 'lesser', 'project', 'next', 'Pocahontas', 'went', 'several', 'personnel', 'changes', 'backstage', 'angst', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'concerned', 'public', 'would', 'reject', 'movie', 'right', 'up', 'first', 'release', 'date.That', 'why', 'such', 'bonus', 'material', 'so', 'valuable', 'important', 'knowledge', 'make', 'appreciate', 'Lion', 'King', 'even', 'more', 'even', 'Simba', 'goat', 'little', 'course', 'really', 'got', 'goat', 'would', 'little', 'more', 'snack', 'would', ""n't""]",N/A

The marriage of music and imagery is very moving, as the wise primate Rafiki offers up the infant Simba to the acclaim and reverence of the animals as ""Circle of Life"" plays.  Rafiki is offering Simba to his life and future as king of the beasts.  But, first, Simba must be a cub learning at the feet of his loving father Mufasa, indelibly voiced by James Earl Jones.  The extent of his malice blissfully unknown to both of them, Mufasa's brother and Simba's uncle Scar plots a monumental killing that will drive Simba away from his pride.Also featuring the voices of Whoopi Goldberg, Cheech Marin, and Johnathan Taylor Thomas, as well a very good bestselling soundtrack, Walt Disney's ""The Lion King"" remains a powerful animated film.",5,"""The Lion King"" is one of the best Disney animated productions of the 1990's.",1328227200,"02 3, 2012",2012,1162,"['SPOILERS', 'FOLLOW', 'Lion', 'King', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Company', '1994', 'animated', 'release', 'crescendo', 'Disney', 'creative', 'burst', 'open', 'decade', 'undoubtedly', 'classic', 'film', 'genre', 'all-star', 'voiceover', 'cast', 'including', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'Jeremy', 'Irons.The', 'movie', 'still', 'striking', 'rich', 'animation', 'immediately', 'evident', 'opening', 'frames', 'sunrise', 'African', 'landscape', 'marriage', 'music', 'imagery', 'very', 'moving', 'wise', 'primate', 'Rafiki', 'up', 'infant', 'Simba', 'acclaim', 'reverence', 'animals', 'Circle', 'Life', 'plays', 'Rafiki', 'offering', 'Simba', 'life', 'future', 'king', 'beasts', 'first', 'Simba', 'must', 'be', 'cub', 'learning', 'feet', 'loving', 'father', 'Mufasa', 'indelibly', 'voiced', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'extent', 'malice', 'blissfully', 'unknown', 'Mufasa', 'brother', 'Simba', 'uncle', 'Scar', 'monumental', 'killing', 'will', 'drive', 'Simba', 'away', 'pride.Also', 'featuring', 'voices', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'Cheech', 'Marin', 'Johnathan', 'Taylor', 'Thomas', 'as', 'well', 'very', 'good', 'bestselling', 'soundtrack', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Lion', 'King', 'powerful', 'animated', 'film']",N/A

More precisely, Disney has excelled in portraying themes, truths, and morals traditionally espoused in Aesop's (predominately) animal fables but in feature-length movies.  Aesop succeeded in conveying his morals because he was usually able to grace his animal characters with human traits and yet let them retain believable animal natures.  Disney's animal movie fables (such as ""Bambi"", ""Dumbo"", ""The Jungle Book"", ""Tarzan"", ""A Bug's Life"") do the same, most of the time.  However, and I don't mean to be the literal skunk at the figurative tea party, ""The Lion King"" almost stumbles in selling its anthropomorphic tale of a prince facing mortality and responsibility.Ironically, this occurs in the opening spectacular ""Circle of Life"" sequence, where all the inhabitants of the African savanna congregate to witness and swear fealty to lord king Mufasa's (James Earl Jones's) new prince cub Simba.  If the characters were human, of course we would enthusiastically accept this stirring scene.  However, and many viewers have noticed this, many of the savannah subjects are herbivores and part of a lion's diet.  It doesn't make much sense to swear loyalty to someone who wants to eat you.  Also, we see giraffes and elephants genuflecting before Simba.  This wouldn't happen in real nature, that's for sure!  Elephants and other megaherbivores are the true lords of the savannah.  ""The Lion King"" (hereafter TLK) tries to account for this gruesome reality by having Mufasa state that, yes, lions eat antelopes but lions die and bring forth the grass that antelopes eat.  Therefore, antelopes, in a sense, eat the lions in turn.  Ehh, not convincing.The second, uneasy anthropomorphic fit occurs after Simba flees into self-imposed exile after mistakenly believing he caused his father's death in the wildebeest stampede, leaving the true culprit, his treacherous uncle Scar (Jeremy Irons) to seize power.  After finally convinced by the shaman baboon Rafiki (Robert Guillomme - sp?) and his childhood friend Nala to return to the ""kingdom"" and wrest it from Scar's paws, Simba finds that under Scar's rule the verdant savannah has become a desolate wasteland (a real ""fixer upper"" according to wisecracking meerkat Timon (Nathan Lane)).  Of course, no animal has control over the climate or other animals' welfare.  The savannah endures cycles of moisture and drought regardless of who controls the pride. Again, this scene would work with human actors who would have SOME control over the welfare, if not climate, and so we pretend again that the animals are acting a human drama.Granted, there are only two instances in TLK that the anthropomorphic conceit doesn't really work, but they are the anchors of the Shakespeareanesque tale of kingship rejected, lost and won and so could potentially make TLK a little wobbly.  However, this problem will bother natural purists.  So please don't get me wrong; I really enjoyed this magnificent movie, because like most everyone else I could overlook these flaws and basically pretend that the characters were just humans in animals' clothing, just like in Aesop's fables.",4,"If You Can Keep in Mind That It Is an Anthropomorphic Fable, ""The Lion King"" is Regal Entertainment",1327968000,"01 31, 2012",2012,3269,"['***This', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers***Most', 'are', 'well', 'acquainted', 'Disney', 'two', 'obsessions', 'animation', 'royalty', 'anthropomorphic', 'animals', 'More', 'precisely', 'Disney', 'excelled', 'portraying', 'themes', 'truths', 'morals', 'traditionally', 'espoused', 'Aesop', 'predominately', 'animal', 'fables', 'feature-length', 'movies', 'Aesop', 'succeeded', 'conveying', 'morals', 'was', 'usually', 'able', 'grace', 'animal', 'characters', 'human', 'traits', 'yet', 'let', 'retain', 'believable', 'animal', 'natures', 'Disney', 'animal', 'movie', 'fables', 'such', 'Bambi', 'Dumbo', 'Jungle', 'Book', 'Tarzan', 'Bug', 'Life', 'do', 'same', 'most', 'time', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'be', 'literal', 'skunk', 'figurative', 'tea', 'party', 'Lion', 'King', 'almost', 'stumbles', 'selling', 'anthropomorphic', 'tale', 'prince', 'facing', 'mortality', 'responsibility.Ironically', 'opening', 'spectacular', 'Circle', 'Life', 'sequence', 'where', 'inhabitants', 'African', 'savanna', 'congregate', 'witness', 'swear', 'fealty', 'lord', 'king', 'Mufasa', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'new', 'prince', 'cub', 'Simba', 'characters', 'were', 'human', 'course', 'would', 'enthusiastically', 'accept', 'stirring', 'scene', 'However', 'many', 'viewers', 'have', 'noticed', 'many', 'savannah', 'subjects', 'are', 'herbivores', 'part', 'lion', 'diet', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'swear', 'loyalty', 'someone', 'who', 'eat', 'Also', 'see', 'giraffes', 'elephants', 'genuflecting', 'Simba', 'would', ""n't"", 'happen', 'real', 'nature', 'sure', 'Elephants', 'other', 'megaherbivores', 'are', 'true', 'lords', 'savannah', 'Lion', 'King', 'hereafter', 'TLK', 'account', 'gruesome', 'reality', 'having', 'Mufasa', 'state', 'yes', 'lions', 'eat', 'antelopes', 'lions', 'die', 'bring', 'forth', 'grass', 'eat', 'Therefore', 'antelopes', 'sense', 'eat', 'lions', 'turn', 'Ehh', 'not', 'convincing.The', 'second', 'uneasy', 'anthropomorphic', 'fit', 'occurs', 'Simba', 'self-imposed', 'exile', 'mistakenly', 'believing', 'caused', 'father', 'death', 'wildebeest', 'stampede', 'leaving', 'true', 'culprit', 'treacherous', 'uncle', 'Scar', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'seize', 'power', 'finally', 'convinced', 'shaman', 'baboon', 'Rafiki', 'Robert', 'Guillomme', 'sp', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Nala', 'return', 'kingdom', 'wrest', 'Scar', 'paws', 'Simba', 'Scar', 'rule', 'verdant', 'savannah', 'become', 'desolate', 'wasteland', 'real', 'fixer', 'upper', 'according', 'wisecracking', 'meerkat', 'Timon', 'Nathan', 'Lane', 'course', 'animal', 'control', 'climate', 'other', 'animals', 'welfare', 'savannah', 'cycles', 'moisture', 'drought', 'regardless', 'who', 'pride', 'Again', 'scene', 'would', 'work', 'human', 'actors', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'SOME', 'control', 'welfare', 'not', 'climate', 'so', 'pretend', 'again', 'animals', 'are', 'acting', 'human', 'drama.Granted', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'instances', 'TLK', 'anthropomorphic', 'conceit', ""n't"", 'really', 'work', 'are', 'anchors', 'Shakespeareanesque', 'tale', 'kingship', 'rejected', 'lost', 'won', 'so', 'could', 'potentially', 'make', 'TLK', 'little', 'wobbly', 'However', 'problem', 'will', 'bother', 'natural', 'purists', 'So', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'magnificent', 'movie', 'most', 'everyone', 'else', 'could', 'overlook', 'flaws', 'basically', 'pretend', 'characters', 'were', 'just', 'humans', 'animals', 'clothing', 'just', 'Aesop', 'fables']",N/A

765331,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,B0000AOWLW,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[0, 0]","I first saw this movie in the theater, where the film benefited well from the wide screen and huge sound of a large theater. Naturally I had to have the movie when it came out on video; my children would never have forgiven me otherwise. The question was whether we should also get the DVD. Well, we now have the DVD and the answer in retrospect seems to be obvious: ABSOLUTELY!Our version of the VHS tape included an Elton John video as an extra, which was nice, but the extras in the DVD version are excellent and far more numerous. As Disney has re-released ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit,"" ""Sleeping Beauty,"" and now ""The Lion King,"" they seem to be getting better and better at value-added extras; more on the extras later. The principal value is in the movie itself, of course, which benefits from a phenomenal cleanup in both the video and the audio. As you compare the condition of the film in some of the extra features with the digital version you can readily see the improvement in video quality. The DVD sound benefits from the greater quantity of information available on the DVD versus tape, and the elimination of hiss and pop is noticeable. Movies such as these are the main reason that everyone should have a DVD player.The movie itself likely skirts the borderline of its G rating. There are several very intense and scary scenes, some involving blood. The murder of Simba's father is particularly intense, and may be frightening to very young members of the audience. However, I believe that with appropriate parental guidance the movie can be an excellent teaching tool as well as good entertainment.The story broke new ground for Disney, which has typically relied on western European and North American mythology and legend for the majority of their full-length animated features. This movie incorporates a central theme embodied by the Elton John and Tim Rice song ""The Circle of Life,"" which has significant ecological meaning as well as explaining life and death. A scary thought for the very young, but the movie introduces the concept that those who have lived before live on, and as long as you remember them, they can never truly be gone, a beautiful and wonderful thought, and but a fraction of the wonderful philosophy lived by the animals in the movie.The story itself is a story of maturing and realizing responsibilities, and telling the truth. Simba is the future king of the pride, and it will be his responsibility to lead the pride and to guard the pride lands, keeping the balance of all things. Simba's father Mufasa (James Earl Jones) is the wise king trying to teach Simba to always do the right thing. Mufasa's brother Scar (Jeremy Irons) has always felt that he should be king, and uses Simba to put Mufasa in a position to be killed. Mufasa then tells Simba that it's all his fault. Simba runs away in guilt and shame.The next portion of the story shows Simba as he meets new friends and grows up, but has yet to take responsibility for anything. A female cub Simba knew before he ran away, Nala (Moira Kelly), comes seeking help for the pride, as the pride lands have become desolate. She finds Simba (as an adult voiced by Matthew Broderick). At first she is unable to convince Simba that he needs to do anything, but after talking to his father (an excellent scene), Simba realizes that it is his responsibility as Mufasa's son to help the pride.The next portion of the movie involves the confrontation between Scar, his henchmen, the hyenas, and the lionesses and Simba. The ending has another somewhat frightening moment for the younger members of the audience, but of course we know what the outcome must be.The extras deserve description, because several are among the best I've yet seen on a Disney DVD. Both Elton John's videos are included for ""The Circle of Life"" and ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight."" Elton's performance in both videos is nothing less than phenomenal. There is one place in the extras where Elton is shown with a full-grown lion. That image alone was worth viewing the voluminous extras. There is another section on the African influence to the movie, particularly the contribution of Lebo M.Another section of the extras talk about the animals themselves, and their actual behavior versus their behavior in the movie. We also see scenes of actual animals to compare to the animated animals.There are a couple of video games, one of which was interesting; the other would perhaps appeal to children. One was a personality test, to see which of the characters you are most like; enjoyable. The other was to match sounds with the animal that made them; fair.Another excellent extra was Timon and Pumbaa's virtual safari. There are two different safaris you can take; one in a jeep, the other in a boat. Both were funny and good. In conjunction with the safaris is a trailer for an upcoming Lion King movie called ""The Lion King 1 1/2.""""The Lion King"" movie is filled with so much for a family: the role and importance of a father; doing right; taking responsibility; considering the effect one's actions has on other living things; and so many other things that I am unable to list them all. The story is well told and animated, and the score is magic. There are so many reasons to show this movie to the whole family. In addition is a collection of some of the best extras ever on a Disney DVD. One of the few movies where I'd like to give the DVD six stars. A movie that should be in every family collection and for anyone who considers themselves an expert on animated movies.",5,Contemporary Classic (Region 2 DVD),1156896000,"08 30,

It's a movie in which all people can relate to and enjoy rather than just children, with tons of elements that are sure to bring the adults back. The movie takes a lot of risks that most animated films at the time refused to take, and executes them so well that it becomes an inspiration. Besides that, the movie exceeds on every single level of production. From the very enjoyable characters to the colorful and lively musical numbers, this film makes it look very simple to make a movie this amazing. There hasn't been a movie this well-made, and there will never be a film that is this well-made again.

765375,A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F,B0000AOWLW,"Terrance Richard ""Terry Richard""","[0, 0]","Probably the greatest animated movie ever made, ""The Lion King"" became the highest money maker at the boxoffice in 1994 and went on to win two Academy Awards for its music written by Sir Elton John and Tim Rice. The story focuses on a young lion cub who is recued by his father after nearly being tramled to death by wild animals. The father, a King over his land, dies, and the cub Simba, runs away thinking he is to blame for his dad's death. In actuality it is Simba's evil uncle Scar who is responsible for this untimely death as he himself wants to be the heir over the land. A tearjerker in every sense, ""The Lion King"" was the first animated film to ever tackle the issue of death with children, and it is highly regarded for its sensitive approach in dramatizing this rare subject matter, especially to preschoolers. I love ""The Lion King"" and it is one of those rare films you can watch in numerous showings. The actors doing the voices of the characters are a who's who in Hollywood featuring James Earl Jones, Madge Sinclair, Jeremy Irons, Whoppi Goldberg, and Matthew Broderick. The DVD itself is long out-of-print as Disney shoved the film back into its archives several years ago, the same way it did with many of its titles, but there are many here on Amazon to buy from individual sellers. Talk is the Blue-Ray version of ""The Lion King"" may have a 2010 release so there is every reason to speculate that another DVD edition is in the works.
