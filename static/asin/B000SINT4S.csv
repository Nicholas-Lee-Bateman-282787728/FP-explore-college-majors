1086297,A2BW9U1CSLIHJX,B000SINT4S,Big Erik,"[0, 0]","The Office, at it's best, is a complex, well-written, and subtle ensemble comedy with a bit of drama thrown in. Season 3, while not quite as consistent as Season 2, still manages to create some of the best individual episodes yet. My main qualm is the meddling by the powers that be with two of the best episodes in series history: ""Traveling Salesmen"" and ""The Return."" These episodes occur one after another, continue various plot threads seamlessly, and are incredibly well-written and clever. iTunes even released an extended, 28-minute cut of ""The Return,"" which was better than the original. I naturally expected it to appear on this set. However, instead of showcasing the two best episodes of the season, the corporate decision-makers condensed and merged them together, creating a single episode (called ""Traveling Salemen/The Return) which not only doesn't have the extended cut material, but also has scenes removed from the original cut, including the hilarious cold open from ""Traveling Salesmen."" To me, this is a mind-boggling decision: instead of giving two great episodes some breathing room, they've had them shortened and squished together. My question is this: why use a DVD to give Office fans less instead of more? The butchering of ""Traveling Salesmen"" and ""The Return"" alone has led me to side with iTunes and make a move for a video ipod--it's the only way I can watch the best episodes from this season! Other these annoying issues, the overall quality of this season is excellent. I just wished they'd created this disc with the fans (and common sense) in mind.",4,Great--but best episodes hurt by decision-making,1229040000,"12 12, 2008",2008,1588,"['Office', 'best', 'complex', 'well-written', 'subtle', 'ensemble', 'comedy', 'bit', 'drama', 'thrown', 'Season', '3', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'consistent', 'Season', '2', 'still', 'create', 'best', 'individual', 'episodes', 'yet', 'main', 'qualm', 'meddling', 'powers', 'be', 'two', 'best', 'episodes', 'series', 'history', 'Traveling', 'Salesmen', 'Return', 'episodes', 'occur', 'one', 'continue', 'various', 'plot', 'threads', 'seamlessly', 'are', 'incredibly', 'well-written', 'clever', 'iTunes', 'even', 'released', 'extended', '28-minute', 'cut', 'Return', 'was', 'better', 'original', 'naturally', 'expected', 'appear', 'set', 'However', 'instead', 'showcasing', 'two', 'best', 'episodes', 'season', 'corporate', 'decision-makers', 'condensed', 'merged', 'together', 'creating', 'single', 'episode', 'called', 'Traveling', 'Salemen/The', 'Return', 'not', 'only', ""n't"", 'have', 'extended', 'cut', 'material', 'also', 'scenes', 'removed', 'original', 'cut', 'including', 'hilarious', 'cold', 'open', 'Traveling', 'Salesmen', 'mind-boggling', 'decision', 'instead', 'giving', 'two', 'great', 'episodes', 'breathing', 'room', ""'ve"", 'had', 'shortened', 'squished', 'together', 'question', 'why', 'use', 'DVD', 'give', 'Office', 'fans', 'less', 'instead', 'more', 'butchering', 'Traveling', 'Salesmen', 'Return', 'alone', 'led', 'side', 'iTunes', 'make', 'move', 'video', 'ipod', 'only', 'way', 'can', 'watch', 'best', 'episodes', 'season', 'Other', 'annoying', 'issues', 'overall', 'quality', 'season', 'excellent', 'just', 'wished', ""'d"", 'created', 'disc', 'fans', 'common', 'sense', 'mind']",The Office: Season Three

1086299,A1HBC0NBQJHT7X,B000SINT4S,Bookphile,"[17, 18]","This is by far one of the most clever and creative shows on television.  It delights in taking a politically incorrect stance about just about everything and, in so doing, shows how susceptible we all are to stereotypes and prejudice.  To say that this show is a sendup of corporate culture is really only discussing one aspect of the show.  It is a complex and colorful story whose characters continue to grow and to shock and amaze the viewer.  It also happens to be one of the funniest shows I have ever had the pleasure of viewing.This season is a standout because of the continuing evolution of the characters.  Like real people, they sometimes act in ways that seem out of character but are the perfect example of the contrast between the face we put on in public and what really makes us who we are on the inside.One of the best examples of the evolution of the character of Michael Scott can be seen in ""The Job"".  As always, Michael assumes too much and thinks too little.  He makes a terrible decision about a romantic relationship on the basis of some very sexist interests in a woman's appearance.  However, in the end, he proves that he is actually a stand-up guy who is loyal to those who are not always deserving of this loyalty.  His character has the mentality of an overgrown child in that he can be unforgivably cruel and petty one moment and then truly lovable the next.One of my personal favorites was ""Beach Games"" because it exemplifies the development of Pam's character.  Pam has long been my favorite but she is almost pathological in allowing others to walk all over her and take advantage of her good nature.  Her outburst in this episode was great to watch because it shows how determined she is to finally take charge of her life.  Throughout the season, she remains the nice woman she has always been but she begins to grow a backbone and to learn that being nice doesn't mean pleasing everyone at all times at the expense of her own happiness.""The Negotiation"" is also an excellent episode because it shows the petty side of Jim and the heroic side of Dwight.  Jim's pettiness becomes more and more evident throughout the season and his seeming determination to hold Pam responible for Roy's actions and his cutting comments to her in the aftermath underscore just how mean he can be at times.  As for Dwight, the season has served to show what a surprisingly great guy he can be and this episode exemplifies this as he refuses to allow Jim to thank him for something he considers to have been his duty.Aside from the powerhouse main characters, the tertiary characters of this show continue to astonish.  There is the often silly Kelly with the cheer I simply can't get out of my head (""This day is bananas.  B-A-N-A-N-A-S"").  There is the creepy Creed whose encounter with a fish in ""Beach Games"" made my husband and I roar with laughter.  There's the rather pathetic Toby, who is constantly dumped on by Mike and who takes his lovelorn status to new levels in ""Cocktails"" where his act of kindness is brushed off by an oblivious Pam.  I could go on and on for hours but, really, the best thing to do is to witness the series for yourself.  You'll doubtless become every bit as hooked as my husband and I are.",5,Utterly fantastic,1202169600,"02 5, 2008",2008,3243,"['far', 'one', 'most', 'clever', 'creative', 'shows', 'television', 'taking', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'stance', 'just', 'everything', 'so', 'doing', 'how', 'susceptible', 'are', 'stereotypes', 'prejudice', 'say', 'show', 'sendup', 'corporate', 'culture', 'really', 'only', 'discussing', 'one', 'aspect', 'show', 'complex', 'colorful', 'story', 'characters', 'continue', 'grow', 'shock', 'amaze', 'viewer', 'also', 'be', 'one', 'funniest', 'shows', 'have', 'ever', 'had', 'pleasure', 'viewing.This', 'season', 'standout', 'continuing', 'evolution', 'characters', 'real', 'people', 'sometimes', 'act', 'ways', 'seem', 'character', 'are', 'perfect', 'example', 'contrast', 'face', 'put', 'public', 'what', 'really', 'who', 'are', 'inside.One', 'best', 'examples', 'evolution', 'character', 'Michael', 'Scott', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'Job', 'always', 'Michael', 'too', 'much', 'too', 'little', 'terrible', 'decision', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'basis', 'very', 'sexist', 'interests', 'woman', 'appearance', 'However', 'end', 'actually', 'stand-up', 'guy', 'who', 'loyal', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'deserving', 'loyalty', 'character', 'mentality', 'overgrown', 'child', 'can', 'be', 'unforgivably', 'cruel', 'petty', 'one', 'moment', 'then', 'truly', 'lovable', 'next.One', 'personal', 'favorites', 'was', 'Beach', 'Games', 'development', 'Pam', 'character', 'Pam', 'long', 'been', 'favorite', 'almost', 'pathological', 'allowing', 'others', 'walk', 'take', 'advantage', 'good', 'nature', 'outburst', 'episode', 'was', 'great', 'watch', 'how', 'determined', 'finally', 'take', 'charge', 'life', 'season', 'nice', 'woman', 'always', 'been', 'grow', 'backbone', 'learn', 'being', 'nice', ""n't"", 'mean', 'pleasing', 'everyone', 'times', 'expense', 'own', 'happiness', 'Negotiation', 'also', 'excellent', 'episode', 'petty', 'side', 'Jim', 'heroic', 'side', 'Dwight', 'Jim', 'pettiness', 'more', 'more', 'evident', 'season', 'seeming', 'determination', 'hold', 'Pam', 'responible', 'Roy', 'actions', 'cutting', 'comments', 'aftermath', 'underscore', 'just', 'how', 'mean', 'can', 'be', 'times', 'Dwight', 'season', 'served', 'show', 'what', 'surprisingly', 'great', 'guy', 'can', 'be', 'episode', 'allow', 'Jim', 'thank', 'something', 'have', 'been', 'duty.Aside', 'powerhouse', 'main', 'characters', 'tertiary', 'characters', 'show', 'continue', 'astonish', 'often', 'silly', 'Kelly', 'cheer', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'head', 'day', 'bananas', 'B-A-N-A-N-A-S', 'creepy', 'Creed', 'encounter', 'fish', 'Beach', 'Games', 'made', 'husband', 'roar', 'laughter', 'rather', 'pathetic', 'Toby', 'who', 'constantly', 'dumped', 'Mike', 'who', 'lovelorn', 'status', 'new', 'levels', 'Cocktails', 'where', 'act', 'kindness', 'brushed', 'off', 'oblivious', 'Pam', 'could', 'go', 'hours', 'really', 'best', 'thing', 'do', 'witness', 'series', ""'ll"", 'doubtless', 'become', 'bit', 'as', 'hooked', 'husband', 'are']",The Office: Season Three

Until, of course, it got canned.I went through all 5 stages of grief.  Denial: another network will pick it up!  Anger: why this show?  WHY?  It is so funny!  Bargaining: Cancel my other favorite shows, I don't care, just don't take this one!  Depression: A show this funny will never come again!  NEVER! *Cries*It wasn't until I saw The Office, specifically season 3, that I finally reached stage 5 with acceptance.  This show is not only as hilarious and shocking as Arrested Development, it actually has a sweet sprinkle of heart that Arrested Development never really had.The Pam/Jim struggle has always been compelling, and season 2 left off with a frustrating cliff hanger.  But this time, the romance is switched from Jim chasing Pam to Pam chasing Jim.  It's truly compelling TV, watching Pam try to win Jim back, while trying to break into the art scene, all while keeping the whole Office family together.While Michael and Dwight may provide the most laughs, Pam is who made me watch all of season 3 in just one weekend.  I just had to see what she was going to do; whether she would give up and be back with Roy again, or if she would have the courage to stand up and fight for what she really wants.Season 1 was good, Season 2, despite the frustrating cliff hanger, was great.  Season 3?  Fantastic.  And this particular cliff hanger has to be the sweetest in television history.  You'll see what I mean.There's also several other surprises in store.

The plots are engaging, the characters amusingly horrifying, the laughs frequent. Mike and Dwight can still make me shudder, even though I know in advance that they will do or say something horribly inappropriate. This is usually followed by a pause, while everyone looks at the camera.  It is a strange mix between sitcom and documentary, but it works.The turning point for me was the Dwight Shrute music video. It is tucked away in the extra material, and you simply should not miss it. Words cannot describe this....thing.As each character stumbles through life, they go to ridiculous extremes. Eventually all of their flaws are exposed, their pain revealed. This is a comedy, but sometimes it is so sad that you feel guilty for laughing. The characters are so self absorbed that they cannot even console each other. Their suffering is done in solitude, even if it is public solitude. Still, I couldn't stop myself from laughing out loud.

The Office has always taken delight in the kind of jokes and irony that will make you squirm, but this season is relentless in this kind of offbeat laugh.As the season opens, Jim, rejected by Pam, transfers to the Stamford Branch and encounters a wacky group of co-workers there, including the sycophantic Andy and the ambitious Karen, with whom he strikes up a romanticv relationship. Back at Scranton, the usual Shenanigans are ongoing, until the Stamford branch closes and Scranton absorbs its workers, including Jim. What follows is a cold war between Pan (nominally back with Roy) and Karen for Jim's affections, Michael's continued on-again/off-again relationship with Jan, and more craziness than you can shake a stick at.This season boasts a number of triumphs: ""Diwali,"" in which the office crew attends a Hindu festival and Michael makes a big mistake with his current ladyfriend; ""The Convict,"" in which the Scranton office is thrown into panic (especially Dwight) when it is discovered one of the Stamford employees once did time; ""Ben Franklin,"" in which simultaneous bachelor and bachelorette parties go horribly wrong; ""Business School,"" in which Michael is asked to lecture at a business school class and a bat is on the loose in the Scranton office; ""Beach Games,"" in which the Scranton crew goes to the beach for a day of fun - but Michael uses it as a chance to pick out his successor; and the season finale, ""The Job,"" in which Michael and Jan's relationship undergoes some extensive changes, Jim considers his future, and Dwight gives a sneak peek of how he would run the Scranton branch.What I didn't like about this season is the near-absence of belly-laughs. The second season, with Jim's endless antagonism of Dwight, Jim and Pam's romantic flirtation, and the general insaniy of the Scranton crew, was a delight and will surely end up on the list of one of the greatest television seasons of all time. This season gets off to a slow start - Jims absense from Scranton is deeply felt and the season doesn't get going until about eight episodes in (although the season opener is pretty brilliant). Also, while Pam comes into her own as a character, her chemistry with Jim is missing due to his relationship with Karen, and the show thus loses one of its most valuable assets. This show functions best when everyone works as an ensemble - Steve Carell, for all his brilliance, cannot carry this show.Additionally, as I mention above, the humor in this season tends towards the dark and creepy - characters show new sides that weren't there before, and it becomes rather unsettling (this becomes abundantly clear in the deleted scenes).

The show also revolves around a love triangle well written characters, Pam, Jim & Karen.  Jim of course still is in denial of Pam and how he feels while he dates Karen.  Believable, great characters makes for a great tv show.  Of course there is the tale of Dwight & Angela...bizarre relationship.

1086307,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000SINT4S,"Cloud ""...""","[5, 5]","Despite the fact it received tons of comparisons to the UK version, I always found the US version to be way better done. The show has finally felt like its own show and not just a simple offshoot like the other versions I've seen out there. While it does follow similar plot ideas, it kind of takes them and makes them feel fresh and not just simply ""well the Brits did it so we have to do it too"".The start of the show centers on the fallout after Jim's big confession to Pam at the end of season 2. Having rejected him, twice, he has to make a change and moves to the Stamford branch. Of course, that branch closes and brings with it most of the personnel, leaving new office employees Andy and Karen. Meanwhile, Michael's still in the love/hate relationship between himself and his superior Jan while Roy is trying to get Pam back.I tried to be intentionally small in describing the big events of this season because that's the fun out of it, in seeing how it develops and thankfully it's not handled in that unrealistic way I've seen in other shows (Grey's Anatomy fans, sorry). For example the Jim/Pam storyline has little moments to suggest their care they have still yet not fully say it such as a funny joke that no one else will get. The only one I'm not completely sold on is Andy since, while given many funny scenes or lines, he seems to be more noticeable from the other employees like he was put on the show specifically to be that wacky co-worker.As for the comedy, there's definately elements of situation comedy where people can relate, there's just outright funny moments or lines and then of course there's that uncomfortable awkwardness that the UK did but at times I felt the British version relied on it too much, as well as their boss, David Brent. Brent was kind of an intentionally annoying and often mean-spirited guy whereas Michael Scott is just so oblivious to it.I find it to be one of the more funnier shows on TV but also one with an actual sense of heart and characters that were endearing (unlike Tim, Dawn and Brent and a bunch of no-name people from the UK), I find it to be one of the more better-written comedies.",5,One of the best shows on right now,1188950400,"09 5, 2007",2007,2151,"['fact', 'received', 'tons', 'comparisons', 'UK', 'version', 'always', 'found', 'US', 'version', 'be', 'way', 'done', 'show', 'finally', 'felt', 'own', 'show', 'not', 'just', 'simple', 'offshoot', 'other', 'versions', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'there', 'follow', 'similar', 'plot', 'ideas', 'kind', 'feel', 'fresh', 'not', 'just', 'simply', 'well', 'Brits', 'did', 'have', 'do', 'too', '.The', 'start', 'show', 'centers', 'fallout', 'Jim', 'big', 'confession', 'Pam', 'end', 'season', '2', 'Having', 'rejected', 'twice', 'make', 'change', 'moves', 'Stamford', 'branch', 'course', 'branch', 'closes', 'most', 'personnel', 'leaving', 'new', 'office', 'employees', 'Andy', 'Karen', 'Meanwhile', 'Michael', 'still', 'love/hate', 'relationship', 'superior', 'Jan', 'Roy', 'trying', 'get', 'Pam', 'back.I', 'tried', 'be', 'intentionally', 'small', 'describing', 'big', 'events', 'season', 'fun', 'seeing', 'how', 'thankfully', 'not', 'handled', 'unrealistic', 'way', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'shows', 'Grey', 'Anatomy', 'fans', 'sorry', 'example', 'Jim/Pam', 'storyline', 'little', 'moments', 'suggest', 'care', 'have', 'still', 'yet', 'not', 'fully', 'say', 'such', 'funny', 'joke', 'one', 'else', 'will', 'get', 'only', 'one', ""'m"", 'not', 'completely', 'sold', 'Andy', 'given', 'many', 'funny', 'scenes', 'lines', 'be', 'more', 'noticeable', 'other', 'employees', 'was', 'put', 'show', 'specifically', 'be', 'wacky', 'co-worker.As', 'comedy', 'definately', 'elements', 'situation', 'comedy', 'where', 'people', 'can', 'relate', 'just', 'outright', 'funny', 'moments', 'lines', 'then', 'course', 'uncomfortable', 'awkwardness', 'UK', 'did', 'times', 'felt', 'British', 'version', 'relied', 'too', 'much', 'as', 'well', 'boss', 'David', 'Brent', 'Brent', 'was', 'kind', 'intentionally', 'annoying', 'often', 'mean-spirited', 'guy', 'Michael', 'Scott', 'just', 'so', 'oblivious', 'it.I', 'find', 'be', 'one', 'more', 'funnier', 'shows', 'TV', 'also', 'one', 'actual', 'sense', 'heart', 'characters', 'were', 'endearing', 'Tim', 'Dawn', 'Brent', 'bunch', 'no-name', 'people', 'UK', 'find', 'be', 'one', 'more', 'better-written', 'comedies']",The Office: Season Three

I watched the second season on TV, but I had to have the second season on DVD too, and when that came in, I sat down and watched the whole thing in one sitting.  Every season gets better and better.  This third season was great, I sat down every Thursday to watch and was never let down.Other reviews cover in great depth the many story lines and characters, so I'll keep it short with a review of the features on the DVD.  Cast and crew commentaries and deleted scenes are fantastic as they were in the previous DVD sets.  There seem to be more of the cast participating in the commentaries than there was in Season 2, including John Krasinski who I remember being absent from the Season 2 commentaries.Overall, a must have!

Season Three ran on NBC from September 2006 to May 2007, and this DVD set contains that season in its entirety.The mockumentary looks at life at the Dunder Mifflin paper company in Scranton--Steve Carell plays Michael Scott, the hilariously clueless regional manager of the company's Scranton branch, and Rainn Wilson stars as Dwight Schrute, his zany assistant.  The American version of ""The Office"" also works in more good, funny characters thanits British counterpartmanages to do.Amidst all of the awkward moments, jockeying for position, pranks, and romances in these episodes, one of the biggest happenings of the third season was the closure of the Stamford branch of the company, resulting in two more regular characters in the Scranton branch.

It's very rare where a show can keep me laughing days after I seen the episode. Unlike many sitcoms where jokes are written for the quick laugh and can be funny regardless of who said it. The Office builds the laughs around its characters and settings, and certain jokes only become funny when they are put into the context of what went on. Something I haven't seen since ""Arrested Development"" aired. Steve Carell is a genius by creating a character so stupid, rude, ignorant, yet fondly to the audience. The Pam and Jim relationship is so intensely cute that I can't help but smile idiotically at every glance the characters give to each other.

The show does not stand up to all the analysis and projection by the viewers.  The show is very good only if you compare it to all the garbage that is on television.

1086323,AQU2FAI5VKE91,B000SINT4S,Jonathan Kim,"[5, 5]","Season 3 of ""The Office"" not only hilariously distinguishes itself from other generic comedies, but further extends the identity of the US version of ""The Office"" beyond the UK version.  In fact, i dare say that future reviewers shouldn't even bother with any comparisons.When it comes to balance, ""The Office"" shows undeniable poise.  The format of the show with its pseudo-documentary camera work with the talking heads sections gives the show an aire of seriousness countered by the witty onscreen action and dialogue.  Also, while Michael (Steve Carell) and Dwight (Rainn Wilson) and their interaction with other characters provide the bulk of the awkward humor (i.e. Michael's obvious discomfort with topics like Oscar's out'ed homosexuality and being dominated in his relationship with Jan), the sweetness and sentimentality of Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam (Jenna Fischer) anchor the action with a love story caught in the lines of inevitability.Sometimes characters seem to be one dimensional, but solid writing breaks them into instantly relatable people.  The forever strangeness of Dwight, but a sense of humanity in his relationship with Angela.  The everyman quality in Jim and his back and forth with the girl of his dreams.  The clueless boss in Michael that really just wants attention just like everyone else.Overall, the third season of ""The Office"" comes highly recommended even without the additional special features and deleted scenes.  The humor may seem a bit slow for newcomers, but after a couple episodes its personality and humor is infectious.

Menta, Jr.","[0, 0]","Another great season of ""The Office"", though initially I experienced some trepidation when discovering, upon watching the first episode in this set, that the perfect little snowglobe/microcosm of comic perfection that was season two of ""The Office"" had apparently been scattered to the winds. You see, there was just something so, well... perfect about that small group of characters permanantly on display in that small office set, playing off one another.  Here- horrors!- we start off with Jim up in Connecticut interacting with a bunch of strangers, with the comic dynamic back in Scranton not having the same familiar flavor due to that change.  Ah, but it soon becomes clear that there is a method to the creators' and writers' madness.  Amid the funny stories (happily, just as weird and entertaining as usual), we slowly get to know and enjoy Jim's new colleagues, watch with interest as Jim's office slowly merges with the Scranton office, and watch with even more interest as the Jim/Pam dynamic slowly picks up again.  In other words, by stirring the pot a little and throwing some new seasonings into the mix, we still get the show we know and love but with a new freshness and a complete lack of repetitiveness.Also enjoyable is that the character of Michael is allowed to further grow, with new complexities being added to the first glimmers of complexity seen in season two.  Happily, Michael is still given his moments of cluelessness (usually when he's talking about women), but it's fun to see him get one up on Dwight and new office buffoon Andy on occasion.  And it's also nice to see Pam and the other women in the office side with Michael when they feel he's being mistreated by Jan.  Good stuff, and- again- a nice combination of familiar and fresh.The special features on these discs remain quite agreeable, too, especially the deleted scenes attached to most of the episodes.  Each deleted scenes segment runs from a few minutes to almost the length of an entire regular show, with each segment feeling like a polished, parallel, (as just as funny) version of the episode you just watched, letting you see the many hilarious scenes that happened in between the scenes of the ""official"" episode.  Don't miss 'em!And now for the long wait for season four of ""The Office"" on DVD.  Sigh, I really should just start to watch these things on regular TV, commercials or not.

1086339,A3SF7QOSUOXTWZ,B000SINT4S,"N. Davies ""Scalpel Reviews""","[1, 1]","The US series continues in full force, perhaps even increasing in comedic brilliance, as it develops both lead and supporting characters to the point where we, the die-hard audience, know them like our kin.Hilarious new character Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), a passive-aggressive sociopath transferred from the Stanford branch, makes many memorable appearances, several of these being personality clashes with Dwight (Rainn Wilson). As with Dwight, audience heroes Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam (Jenna Fischer) subject Andy to a variety of outlandish pranks.Dwight himself ups the comedic ante almost tenfold; indeed, it is this series that made Rainn Wilson a superstar. A particular highlight is episode three, where Dwight and boss Michael (the mesmerizing cast lead Steve Carell) have an unforgettable run-in over Michael's job.The budding romance between Michael and his boss Jan (the gorgeous Melora Hardin) begins in earnest, helped by the fact that Jan is sinking further into a nervous breakdown. Other office romances either run their course or are given a fresh perspective by the series' end.While it's the first half of the series, up to the episode featuring Phyllis's wedding, where the comedy is truly cerebral and almost dazzling in its hilarity, the remainder is still very funny. At any price below US$40.00, this DVD is a bargain, especially since there are so many deleted scenes on each of the four discs. You can play these scenes back-to-back and create new pseudo-episodes that run for almost an hour per disc. And these aren't your average deleted scenes - for those who appreciate the blackest of black comedy, they are even better than the scenes that made the final cut.

The moment I finished watching the last episode of Season 2, I ran out and bought the third season. And I had to drive to another town to get it, and I was almost entirely broke. But I had to see it, and of course, it was all worth it.The same things I admired so much about Season 2 I admire here. The Office is just about the only sitcom I can think of that has created such a meaningful and coherent storyline over several seasons. The Pam and Jim story is what drives this show, and the writers, producers, actors, and everyone else have outdone themselves in developing that story logically and meaningfully. The intrusion of Karen into that story has flipped things in a way that have allowed Pam and Jim to grow and learn to see their hearts. Really, this is a show that has more heart to it than any other currently on television.The final two episodes of the season, especially, are wonderful. I can't tell you how many times I've watched Pam's speech at the end of ""Beach Games."" What a scene!Of course, everything else is wonderful, too. Dwight has been brought along nicely, and the Michael and Jan relationship provides tons of laughs. I think that the writers made a smart move creating Andy. Dwight's become a little too likeable to be quite the goofy antagonist he was in the first couple of seasons. Andy handles some of that load well. The funniest moment of the whole series, in my opinion, is at the end of ""Cocktails"" when Andy reappears. I called about three people (who'd already seen the show) to talk about it afterward.So, this is another wonderful season for The Office.

One would think that being confined to an office setting, the storylines would get stagnant, but that is not the case. As the series progresses, the characters become more and more developed.I'm amazed how the writers are able to weave all of these dynamic characters into a cohesive narrative, but they do it so successfully. The actors have great intuition and they play-off of each other very well.In the third season, Jim has transferred to D-M's Stamford branch in Connecticut. They cleverly bounce back and forth between Scranton and Stamford establishing parallel narratives which intersect from time to time.It's just a real treat to see the series progress.

1086351,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000SINT4S,Robert Moore,"[74, 137]","Warning!  There are spoilers in the following review.Briefly, the history of my response to the NBC version of THE OFFICE is as follows:  before it started horror that they were remaking a the BBC masterpiece, then surprise in Season One (at least after the first horrid episode, which I think all of us OFFICE fans would like to forget) that it was not only not horrid but actually pretty good, and then delight in Season Two as it got better and better.  Starting Season Three I was fearful, afraid that it was not going to be able to keep the show on the level of genius that it had maintained through the previous season.  But once again my expectations and fears were confounded.  It easily stayed as fresh and as brilliant as it had been in Season Three.In terms of format I find THE OFFICE to be one of the most interesting shows on TV.  For the past twenty years most shows--well, at least almost all good ones--have struggled with a balance between standalone episodes (or the episodic format strictly speaking) and serial arcs.  THE X-FILES, one of the most important shows in the development of the modern story arc, alternated between rigidly standalone episodes and what they termed their ""mythology"" episodes.  But most shows have more and more come to adopt a hybrid format in which they will have episode elements while at the same time gradually moving forward their arcs.  THE OFFICE in most ways is an episode series, in that for most of the characters everything restarts each week and they are not really part of an evolving story.  For the most part THE OFFICE has maintained arcs built around office romances, most importantly Pam and Jim but also Michael and Jan, with Dwight and Angela as well as Ryan and Kelly in the background.  But they managed to work in a couple of other arcs in Season Three as well, most notably Andy's attempt to rebuild the structures of power in the office.  But nonetheless, the overwhelming ongoing story in THE OFFICE is that of Pam and Jim.Season Two ended with Pam and Jim kissing during casino night.  In Season Three we learn that Jim transferred to the Stamford office of Dunder-Mifflin in order to distance himself from Pam, who ultimately rejected his overtures.  Ironically, shortly after Jim left she broke off her engagement to Roy.  Most of Season Three deals with Pam and Jim's ongoing and largely unresolved feelings about each other.  Things are complicated when in Stamford Jim begins dating the lovely and eventually likable Karen (played by the lovely Rashida Jones), which means he is unavailable to see Pam when he returns to Scranton when the Stamford office is closed.  Of course we all want Jim and Pam together, but we like Karen also.  The resulting situation is therefore somewhat the reverse of Season Two, when Jim spent the season pining over Pam.  This year Pam pines over Jim, but with one major difference.  While in Season Two Jim and Pam were best friends despite how Jim felt about Pam, in Season Three things are strained between them.  Pam, in fact, is quite alone most of the season.One definitely senses that Jim and Pam are finally on the verge of getting together in Season Four.  Looking ahead for just a second, one wonders if the writers will truly allow this to happen.  One truism in contemporary TV writing is that you can never let the main romantic couple on a show get together for long.  This is known as the David and Maddie Problem, named for the lead couple in MOONLIGHTING.  As soon as Bruce Willis's David and Cybil Shepherd's Maddie made love, interest in the show disintegrated (though personally I think the irregular appearance of new episodes was as much to blame) and it gradually came to an end.  (This is also sometimes called the Lois and Clark Problem, since THE ADVENTURES OF LOIS AND CLARK saw a sharp decline in ratings as soon as the two of them became involved.)  Since then writers and producers have been terrified of getting couples together.  Generally when two people get together you can guess that something catastrophic is about to happen.  So, will Pam and Jim try to make a go of it in Season Four?  Will the writers attempt to overcome the jinx of David and Maddie?  Just one of the mysteries to be solved in Season Three.I cannot express how much I love this cast.  I must confess that I side with a number of leading TV critics (like TV Guide's Matt Roush) in confessing that I'm not a huge fan of either Steve Carrell's Michael Scott or Rainn Wilson's Dwight Schrute.  I know they are hugely popular with many fans, but I find both of them a tad too hard to believe in.  I prefer the rest of the cast, which has expanded in importance over the course of the past two seasons.  I love the way we have been able to get to know all the regulars in the office, not merely Pam and Jim, but Ryan, Kelly, Phyllis, Kevin, Meredith, Toby, Angela, Oscar, Stanley, and Darryl.  And for the record, I don't always find Michael unentertaining.  It is merely that at times he does things that make me so uncomfortable that I squirm.  And Dwight is sometimes funny, though far too often he becomes so extreme that he passes over being funny to something else.  I find Dwight to be at his best when he is trying to help others instead of reacting to his own all embracing set of fears.I will confess gratitude to Dwight's frequent and sometimes wonderful shout outs to my favorite show on TV, BATTLESTAR GALACTICA.  One interesting aspect to television in the 2006-2007 season was the sheer number of references in various series to BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, which some observers has speculated may be the most avidly viewed series by TV and movie industry outsiders than any other (THE OFFICE might well be second; BSG creative genius Ron Moore confesses to be a huge fan).  THE GILMORE GIRLS, HEROES, VERONICA MARS, SOUTH PARK, THE O.C., and several other series all made nods towards BSG, but no show more frequently than THE OFFICE.  And Dwight may have had the best BSG line in any of the aforementioned shows in an episode when he confronted a somewhat older and very conservative looking gentleman at a Dunder-Mifflin part and asked him, ""Do you watch BATTLESTAR GALACTICA?""  ""No.""  ""You sir, are an idiot.""Like the previous season, Season Three provided us with a host of unforgettable moments.  So many of them are hard to summarize because they are caught in a glance or a look, especially by Pam or Jim.  Some highlights include Michael's insistence at giving Oscar a kiss after learning he was gay.  Or Dwight's sly smile when Michael, speculating on the sexual preference of some of the office employees, asks Dwight, ""What about Angela?  I can imagine her with a woman.  Can't you?""  Or Kelly sprinting into Victoria's Secret after Michael offers to buy all of the women into the office a single item from their stock.  Or Michael being the only person from the office to show up at an art showing by Pam and his buying one of her paintings for the office.  Or Michael contemplating jumping off the top of the building onto a balloon that would certainly not keep him from dying.  Or Pam running across hot coals and then confronting Jim over ceasing to be her friend.  I'm sure that every fan has his or her own set of memories.This was also the season when the show had a number of celebrity directors.  Harold Ramis directed several episodes.  J. J. Abrams directed one.  And Joss Whedon, the creator of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, directed ""Business School,"" in which Jim pretends to have been bitten by a bat that caught trapped inside the office.  Jim proceeds to distress Dwight into thinking that he might have been turned into a vampire, first rubbing a tooth as if it might be on the verge of growing into a fang and later complaining of how bright the light is.  Hopefully Season Four will bring additional well-known guest directors.THE OFFICE proved so popular in Season Three that NBC briefly suggested that the show expand to an hour each week.  Every fan I talked to reacted to horror at this.  If we could be assured that the show would be a brilliant and as funny for an hour each week, then I'm sure everyone would be delighted with the prospect, but the fear is that the show would become diluted and there would be a watering down of ideas and humor.  Luckily NBC backed off the request, though it was agreed that there will be four hour-long episodes in Season Four.Lastly, hopefully Jenna Fischer will be recovered from a terrible accident that she had this summer in New York during the Upfront Presentation.  According to what I have read, she slipped on a marble staircase and hit her back hard against the steps.  Luckily, although she broke several bones in her back she did not sustain any nerve damage.  Her recovery will evidently overlap with the beginning of shooting for the new season.  I'm hopeful that she will be feeling well enough to not miss any episodes or more importantly to be in any ongoing pain.",5,Without question my favorite comedy on TV,1183680000,"07 6,

Expectations were high, and I must say, now, after having watched all of it, it didn't totally do it for me.The third season is almost like one continuous story; almost every episode is linked so that you have to watch them in order, or it won't make sense. I missed the randomness of season 2 (which will probably be the show's magnum opus); instead, the show became extremely personal and deep as the character's relationships are fleshed out. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it was almost too much. Too much over-the-top awkwardness, too much sexual innuendo, too much heartbreak. One thing the show is excellent at is making you a part of it so that you feel like you're part of the group of peope at Dunder-Mifflin. So when heartbreaking things happen (and believe me, they happen a lot in this season), you can totally relate. There's hardly a light moment, and when they come, they're welcomed. I felt the episode ""Traveling Salesman"" was the only one that felt true to the spirit of the show. But I found that after watching the whole season, I had a deeper caring for the people (notably Jim and Pam), which was very rewarding.I will say I enjoyed the addition of Andy Bernard and Karen Filippelli. Andy is very well-played by Ed Helms, using Andy's annoying personality to create hilarious moments of outburst. Rashida Jones as Karen is probably the most beautiful woman I've ever seen, and I was shocked at times at how her relationship with Jim was often joyless. This is where the heartbreak comes in. Jim is dating Karen, Karen feels awkward with Pam, Jim has to balance out his friendship. Decisions, decisions.MAJOR SPOILER AHEAD: There was a very touching moment at the last episode where we think Jim will get the job at corporate and continue his relationship with Karen.

I understand that Angela is a bit judgemental of those who do not share her faith.  I know that rubs a lot of people the wrong way.  But they do not have to make her out to be a total shrew.Do I laugh at times while watching this often sleazy show?  Of course, there are many clever and laugh-out-loud moments.  I like laughing at male idiots as much as my neo-femme sisters out there (unite!).  Michael Scott is a pathetic waste of life and Dwight Schrute is an even nerdier piece of garbage.  But unfortunately the females aren't really much better, suggesting an overall distain for humanity that isn't very becoming of the show's creative ""talents.""Take Kelly for instance - pathetically dependant upon the affection of Ryan (who doesn't even like her, that rat!).  She's an airhead.What about Jan Levinson?  You must truly be kidding me if you think she represents a headstrong feminist presence.  Her and Michael's troubled romance is a joke, if you ask me.  In this one rare instance, I actually do have some sympathy for the male - though Michael shouldn't allow himself to be so used and taken advantage of.I guess most women, especially the young and inexperienced among you, relate the most to Jenna Fischer's Pam Beasley.  Heaven help me, that woman is the worst of the bunch.  Her artwork is beyond hopeless (and yes, I do know what I'm talking about thank you).  And her idea of a career appears to be sitting behind a front desk and answering phones.  How every fulfilling.  Look, I may not have kids either (not yet anyway), but I have dealt with them for years.  Parenting takes discipline, but it is one of the truest ""labors of love"" I know.  Pam has neither the maturity nor the intelligence to even consider becoming a mother.  Come to think of it, I believe only Stanley is a parent of all the people on the show.  What a shame.Watch it for what it does best: portraying the utter cluelessness of the men who run our society.

What gives it this appeal is how unordinary a show The Office is.  It just has the perfect blend of awkward situations that make you winch and keep you in stitches, in addition to a very compelling love story that adds to the addictiveness.Where as the last season focused mainly on Jim and Pam's budding relationship, there are several other office relationships this time around to keep it interesting.  This season also sees the addition of Karen and Andy to the cast as new employees from another branch of the company that got shut down.  By this point Karen and Jim have started seeing each other, which gives a shot of new life into the Pam/Jim storyline.  It's a pretty much the opposite of last season where Pam was engaged and Jim was secretly in love with her.  In the meantime Andy becomes Dwight's competition for the office suck up.This season without a doubt piles on the drama, but that's not to say that it forgets to be funny.  A lot of the best comedic moment stem from the dramatic stuff and there are plenty of laugh out loud moments.  The writing is just as sharp as it ever was and the tone of the show never falters.  If you liked this show previously, there's no doubt that you'll continue to love it.  And those who haven't seen it... start at the beggining because all the storylines carry over from season to season.

1086362,A1UELNBJF9CQ36,B000SINT4S,TEK,"[2, 12]","** Disclaimer:  Especially in the world of popular culture, it is often difficult for Christians to receive information from their own perspective.  Their sensibilities simply aren't taken into account.  I think it is important for there to be some representation of this perspective, and so I will be reviewing this item from the vantage point of a Christian.  In so doing, I mean in no way to offend non-Christians or to suggest that they have no right to their own views on this item and it's characteristics.  Nor do I mean to suggest that mine is the correct or only Christian view.  To each their own, with respect.Honestly, I really enjoy watching ""The Office"".  The show overall is one of my favorites, and season two in particular if funny, a definite improvement over season one.  I give this season four stars, however, because I know that sometimes I enjoy the show when perhaps I shouldn't.  This show is certainly not a model of cleanliness that marked the bygone era when entertainment writers were concerned with offending moral sensibilities.To be sure, compared to much of the entertainment found on TV these days, this show is fairly clean.  There is basically no nudity (in terms of nudity, season two is cleaner than season three) and virtually no violence.  The objectionable material, then, is basically the written content... the humor.  And it is in this area that there are basically two areas of concern.  First, the language.  It is more than a rare occasion that questionable language is used, though clearly explicit language is practically never used.  Second, the humor and innuendo, the subject matter of the humor, is often inappropriate.  The entire show is basically crass.  While I don't think that all crass humor is inappropriate, and neither do I think that all the crass humor in this show is inappropriate, sometimes the humor crosses the that unidentifiable line into the offensive.  Nevertheless, this show has some redeeming qualities.  Aside from the crass humor, the humor of the characters themselves is incredibly funny.  In fact, I think the best part about this show is the strength of the characters and the extent to which they complement each other.Perhaps the most serious challenge this show poses to the Christian faith are the more subtle critiques.  For example, there is not one serious Christian character.  The one character that is purported to be a Christian is really portrayed as a hypocrite and a mockery.  And the few truly endearing characters are clearly not Christian as they live non-Christian lifestyles (namely sleeping with and living with their boyfriends/girlfriends).  Needless to say, there isn't anything in this show that supports Christian morals or displays Christianity in a favorable light.I would hesitate to give this item to anyone younger than 18 (a hesitation I'm sure most of the people reading this will find to be absurd).  What is needed is a viewer who can understand the subtle difference between making light and fun of social indiscretions and endorsing them.  Nevertheless, I think you can generally watch this show as a Christian without compromising your faith.  Overall I think season three pushes the envelope more than seasons one and two.  In season three there is more overtly sexual content and there seems to be more examples of foul language.",4,A Christian Perspective,1201478400,"01 28, 2008",2008,3351,"['**', 'Disclaimer', 'Especially', 'world', 'popular', 'culture', 'often', 'difficult', 'Christians', 'receive', 'information', 'own', 'perspective', 'sensibilities', 'simply', 'are', ""n't"", 'taken', 'account', 'think', 'important', 'be', 'representation', 'perspective', 'so', 'will', 'be', 'reviewing', 'item', 'vantage', 'point', 'Christian', 'so', 'doing', 'mean', 'way', 'offend', 'non-Christians', 'suggest', 'have', 'right', 'own', 'views', 'item', 'characteristics', 'do', 'mean', 'suggest', 'mine', 'correct', 'only', 'Christian', 'view', 'own', 'respect.Honestly', 'really', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'Office', 'show', 'overall', 'one', 'favorites', 'season', 'two', 'particular', 'funny', 'definite', 'improvement', 'season', 'one', 'give', 'season', 'four', 'stars', 'however', 'know', 'sometimes', 'enjoy', 'show', 'when', 'perhaps', 'should', ""n't"", 'show', 'certainly', 'not', 'model', 'cleanliness', 'marked', 'bygone', 'era', 'when', 'entertainment', 'writers', 'were', 'concerned', 'offending', 'moral', 'sensibilities.To', 'be', 'sure', 'compared', 'much', 'entertainment', 'found', 'TV', 'days', 'show', 'fairly', 'clean', 'basically', 'nudity', 'terms', 'nudity', 'season', 'two', 'cleaner', 'season', 'three', 'virtually', 'violence', 'objectionable', 'material', 'then', 'basically', 'written', 'content', 'humor', 'area', 'are', 'basically', 'two', 'areas', 'concern', 'First', 'language', 'more', 'rare', 'occasion', 'questionable', 'language', 'used', 'clearly', 'explicit', 'language', 'practically', 'never', 'used', 'Second', 'humor', 'innuendo', 'subject', 'matter', 'humor', 'often', 'inappropriate', 'entire', 'show', 'basically', 'crass', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'crass', 'humor', 'inappropriate', 'neither', 'do', 'think', 'crass', 'humor', 'show', 'inappropriate', 'sometimes', 'humor', 'unidentifiable', 'line', 'offensive', 'Nevertheless', 'show', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'Aside', 'crass', 'humor', 'humor', 'characters', 'incredibly', 'funny', 'fact', 'think', 'best', 'part', 'show', 'strength', 'characters', 'extent', 'complement', 'other.Perhaps', 'most', 'serious', 'challenge', 'show', 'Christian', 'faith', 'are', 'more', 'subtle', 'critiques', 'example', 'not', 'one', 'serious', 'Christian', 'character', 'one', 'character', 'purported', 'be', 'Christian', 'really', 'portrayed', 'hypocrite', 'mockery', 'few', 'truly', 'endearing', 'characters', 'are', 'clearly', 'not', 'Christian', 'live', 'non-Christian', 'lifestyles', 'namely', 'sleeping', 'living', 'boyfriends/girlfriends', 'Needless', 'say', ""n't"", 'anything', 'show', 'Christian', 'morals', 'displays', 'Christianity', 'favorable', 'light.I', 'would', 'hesitate', 'give', 'item', 'anyone', 'younger', '18', 'hesitation', ""'m"", 'sure', 'most', 'people', 'reading', 'will', 'find', 'be', 'absurd', 'What', 'needed', 'viewer', 'who', 'can', 'understand', 'subtle', 'difference', 'making', 'light', 'fun', 'social', 'indiscretions', 'endorsing', 'Nevertheless', 'think', 'can', 'generally', 'watch', 'show', 'Christian', 'compromising', 'faith', 'Overall', 'think', 'season', 'three', 'envelope', 'more', 'seasons', 'one', 'two', 'season', 'three', 'more', 'overtly', 'sexual', 'content', 'there', 'be', 'more', 'examples', 'foul', 'language']",The Office: Season Three

Last season wasn't so hot and I'm not sure if that was due to a diminishing story line to work with or the departure of Steve Carell. Either way, the more recent programs from The Office shouldn't detract from the enjoyment of the past seasons.I consider season 3 to be the tip top! It was really hitting its peak and opened up new avenues and characters for the writers to explore. This season set up seasons 4 & 5 and that three season span was executed in remarkable fashion. Overall, the extras, the quality of the DVD's and the program itself leaves me no other decision than to give it 5 stars! You will watch these episodes over and over again.

The webisodes are funny and the deleted scenes are as good as the final cut. Which brings me to the only complaint I have. The deleted scenes should have been incorporated with the shows. I think they add to the plot as well as contributes to character development. That complaint does not justify my deducting a star but it's just a personal gripe. The best comedy on TV since Everybody Loves Raymond. I thought comedy died on TV.

1086372,AP3B615GM191G,B000SINT4S,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 0]","To be brutally honest, the second season of this show (the one preceding this one) will most likely be viewed as the funniest of the bunch, as the show was still incredibly fresh and the writers still had a large bank of ideas from which to draw on.  Season Three, while still incredibly funny, didn't have quite the extra ""oomph"" that the second season had (what with the incredible Jim & Pam romance).  That being said, after finishing this third installment of the show, I actually have gained even more respect for the writers and actors, as they didn't fall into the ""same old, same old"" trap of many comedies and instead kept right on developing the characters we have come to know and love.The biggest change, of course, is the separation of Jim and Pam.  As the third season opens, Jim has taken a position at the Stanford branch of Dunder-Mifflin (away from ""beloved"" Scranton) to try and escape the awkwardness of the Pam/Roy relationship (which begins to experience trouble of its own).  This move, while losing the playfulness of the interactions of those two characters (which I consider to be the backbone of the entire show), actually serves to give the show more credibility, as you will be pulling even more for the couple to be re-united (whether or not that actually happens is for you to find out!).Another curveball from the previous season is the development of characters from the Stanford branch.  While season two essentially takes place almost exclusively inside the Scranton office, this season spends a considerable amount of time following Jim as he meets and interacts with his new co-workers.  Again, this may not be what you want to see in the short-term, but it eventually serves to give the show an even stronger base of characters in Andy Bernard and Karen Fillipelli (a potential love-interest for Jim).However, besides the ""loss"" of Jim and Pam for the time being, the rest of the show still rolls along with laugh after laugh.  Michael Scott shines brighter than ever, Dwight is still hilarious, and the supporting cast does a remarkable job of keeping themselves relevant to the ongoing storylines.Thus, although this season is a bit weaker than the two previous ones due to the factors described above, I have to give the writers/creators credit for not falling into the trap of repetition and allowing the show to grow stale.  Instead, they stretch things in a whole new capacity and, by the end of the season, end up a better show for it going forward.",5,Gains My Respect For Developing Characters Instead Of Relying On Repetition,1260835200,"12 15, 2009",2009,2494,"['be', 'brutally', 'honest', 'second', 'season', 'show', 'one', 'preceding', 'one', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'be', 'viewed', 'funniest', 'bunch', 'show', 'was', 'still', 'incredibly', 'fresh', 'writers', 'still', 'had', 'large', 'bank', 'ideas', 'draw', 'Season', 'Three', 'still', 'incredibly', 'funny', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'quite', 'extra', 'oomph', 'second', 'season', 'had', 'what', 'incredible', 'Jim', 'Pam', 'romance', 'being', 'said', 'finishing', 'third', 'installment', 'show', 'actually', 'have', 'gained', 'even', 'more', 'respect', 'writers', 'actors', 'did', ""n't"", 'fall', 'same', 'old', 'same', 'old', 'trap', 'many', 'comedies', 'instead', 'kept', 'right', 'developing', 'characters', 'have', 'come', 'know', 'love.The', 'biggest', 'change', 'course', 'separation', 'Jim', 'Pam', 'third', 'season', 'opens', 'Jim', 'taken', 'position', 'Stanford', 'branch', 'Dunder-Mifflin', 'away', 'beloved', 'Scranton', 'try', 'escape', 'awkwardness', 'Pam/Roy', 'relationship', 'experience', 'trouble', 'own', 'move', 'losing', 'playfulness', 'interactions', 'two', 'characters', 'consider', 'be', 'backbone', 'entire', 'show', 'actually', 'give', 'show', 'more', 'credibility', 'will', 'be', 'pulling', 'even', 'more', 'couple', 'be', 're-united', 'not', 'actually', 'find', 'out', 'curveball', 'previous', 'season', 'development', 'characters', 'Stanford', 'branch', 'season', 'two', 'essentially', 'place', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'Scranton', 'office', 'season', 'considerable', 'amount', 'time', 'following', 'Jim', 'new', 'co-workers', 'Again', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'what', 'want', 'see', 'short-term', 'eventually', 'give', 'show', 'even', 'stronger', 'base', 'characters', 'Andy', 'Bernard', 'Karen', 'Fillipelli', 'potential', 'love-interest', 'Jim', '.However', 'loss', 'Jim', 'Pam', 'time', 'being', 'rest', 'show', 'still', 'laugh', 'laugh', 'Michael', 'Scott', 'shines', 'brighter', 'ever', 'Dwight', 'still', 'hilarious', 'supporting', 'cast', 'remarkable', 'job', 'keeping', 'relevant', 'ongoing', 'storylines.Thus', 'season', 'bit', 'weaker', 'two', 'previous', 'ones', 'due', 'factors', 'described', 'have', 'give', 'writers/creators', 'credit', 'not', 'falling', 'trap', 'repetition', 'allowing', 'show', 'grow', 'stale', 'Instead', 'stretch', 'things', 'whole', 'new', 'capacity', 'end', 'season', 'end', 'up', 'better', 'show', 'going', 'forward']",The Office: Season Three
