I knew a lot about the Tower, but this DVD exposed much more in-depth than I could have imagined!  It goes into stories that most people would never know, nor will have the opportunity to know.  It shows ceremonies which have NEVER before been seen by the public.  It enters places that are ""off limits"" to the public.  Truly an excellent exploration of the Tower!  I cannot recommend it higher!",5,Very comprehensive!,1199836800,"01 9, 2008",2008,497,"['lived', 'London', 'six', 'years', 'minute', 'was', 'wonderful', 'visited', 'Tower', 'numerous', 'times', 'knew', 'lot', 'Tower', 'DVD', 'exposed', 'much', 'more', 'in-depth', 'could', 'have', 'imagined', 'stories', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'never', 'know', 'will', 'have', 'opportunity', 'know', 'ceremonies', 'have', 'NEVER', 'been', 'seen', 'public', 'places', 'are', 'limits', 'public', 'Truly', 'excellent', 'exploration', 'Tower', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'higher']",The Tower

1056307,A2BSZPRBKYAB2K,B000NDFHX4,"Joe Owen ""Joe""","[0, 0]","This is an excellent historical history of the Tower of London and goes into interesting, if not well known facts and history of the famous Tower Of London.  Good historical analysis by subject experts, good if not dated computer graphics about the Tower, and interesting tidbits of everyday rituals of the Tower such as the role of the Beef Eaters in the Key Ceremony which has occured nightly for over 400 years.  The series is divided into historical segments and funtions of the Tower such as the role of the Tower in history, the Crown Jewels, the Towers role throughout history as a fortress, prison, and safe guarding the Crown Jewels.  The only distraction of the series is the editing of the sound, and the interviews with a few experts during public tours of the tour and the sound behind the interviews.  My criticism is that I am sure that the interviews could of been made after hours where a constant flow of people in the scenes was very distracting.  Some of the sound in the DVD's is quite loud and distracts at times.  Overall though, this is a good series for anyone interested in the famous Tower of London, its history, and the function of the Tower today.

I didn't buy a Historical Documentary about the tower of Londonto watch Americans go to the south! I am an American-I see them all the time.The only reason why I bought this was to get a comprehensive overview of the towerThey mention that William the conquer built it (is that right? I learned Nothing!) and that is something I would liketo know-how long was it someone's house? How long did it take to build-why was it built where it was built, those kind of things.Another episode they talk about the famous Jewels that was pretty interesting, but than they go on and onabout Colonel Blood, and the next thing you know once again they are no longer in the Tower of London, but herethere everywhere. Lots of bad reenactments- its choppy there is nothing snuggly about it.No feeling of sinking into stone cold knowledge...just B.S boring afternoon filler type narrationit really sucks",3,not great,1382572800,"10 24, 2013",2013,1198,"['was', 'disappointed', 'Saturday', 'afternoon', 'nothing', 'else', 'T.V', 'feeling', 'lame', 'documentary.There', 'was', ""n't"", 'lot', 'substance', 'one', 'episode', 'are', 'America', 'chasing', 'down', 'letterin', 'city', 'Charleston..', 'who', 'why', 'letter', 'American', 'ancestor', 'again', 'why', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'Historical', 'Documentary', 'tower', 'Londonto', 'watch', 'Americans', 'go', 'south', 'am', 'American-I', 'see', 'time.The', 'only', 'reason', 'why', 'bought', 'was', 'get', 'comprehensive', 'overview', 'towerThey', 'mention', 'William', 'conquer', 'built', 'right', 'learned', 'Nothing', 'something', 'would', 'liketo', 'know-how', 'long', 'was', 'someone', 'house', 'How', 'long', 'did', 'take', 'build-why', 'was', 'where', 'was', 'built', 'kind', 'things.Another', 'episode', 'talk', 'famous', 'Jewels', 'was', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'go', 'Colonel', 'Blood', 'next', 'thing', 'know', 'once', 'again', 'are', 'longer', 'Tower', 'London', 'herethere', 'everywhere', 'Lots', 'bad', 'reenactments-', 'choppy', 'nothing', 'snuggly', 'it.No', 'feeling', 'sinking', 'stone', 'cold', 'knowledge', 'just', 'B.S', 'boring', 'afternoon', 'filler', 'type', 'narrationit', 'really', 'sucks']",The Tower
