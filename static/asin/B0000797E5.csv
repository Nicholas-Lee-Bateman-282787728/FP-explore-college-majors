(And, if you are, please do not miss this show)I was immediately amazed at the bluntness and raunchiness of this show. Nothing is alluded to or glazed over. The sex jokes are sex jokes; the sex situations are sex situations, and get this, all the adults act like adults. It was funny to me that someone ewould compare this to Friends.I think that the show does everything that Friends didn't: make single adult life in the city soemthing people can relate to. I cant say enough hjow un watered down this show really is.The only gripe I have is the acting. At times i's a little blotchy, and a little campy. But, with the comedic situations (like the ""giggaloop"", or the ""lesbian spanking inferno"") you forgive the actors for their shortcomings!The series, which I have only watched the First Season, is a delight.

725469,AR37967IAR6ZT,B0000797E5,Benjamin,"[4, 4]","The British &quot;Coupling,&quot; the version that is worth watching, features some absolutely terrific acting, wonderful comedy and true moments of innovation. Jack Davenport, who starred in &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot; and &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean,&quot; appears in this BBC series as Steve, who in the series' first episode breaks up with the daffy Jane and goes on a date with Susan, who is clever and sexy. Susan, of course, has just broken up with Patrick the human tripod, who is now interested in Sally, Susan's best friend and a beautician obsessed with preserving herself. Rounding out the characters is Jeff, an altogether weird one who is Steve's best friend and Susan's co-worker. If you've seen the American version, then you get the basic idea of how they all meet and mix together.But to see a cast of true inspiration and genuine hilarity, you need to catch these DVDs of the British series. The acting is better, the episodes are deeper, the writing is more clever and twisted. There's no canned laughter on this version - nor is there reason for it. (The episode &quot;Inferno,&quot; featuring a dinner party and a porn video, is the one of the most hilarious half-hours I've ever seen of TV.)If you want to know what the big deal about &quot;Coupling&quot; is, this is where you need to look.",5,Do NOT watch the US version.

725478,A1T17LMQABMBN5,B0000797E5,CoffeeGurl,"[4, 6]","I got into the show Coupling a couple of years ago when I visited my boyfriend in his native land (Britain) and was hooked immediately. From thereon in I didn't miss an episode of the show on BBC America. The only problem was that I hadn't been able to catch the first season reruns. Coupling -- The Complete First Season is a clear indication as to why I became a big fan of this hilarious and clever Brit-com. The show is about six thirty-something single Londoners and their relationship plights. Well, there's a lot more to it than that. The clever one-liners, the hilarious situations and the smart and witty quips among the six friends make this show a comic marble. The three girls -- Susan (the sexy one), Sally (the anal retentive one) and Jane (the eccentric, manipulative one) -- are great and sort of remind me of Rachel, Monica and Phoebe (sorry, but I am sure that most of you saw that one coming). And the guys -- Steve (the more romantic one), Patrick (the commitmentphobic one) and Jeff (the hilarious, somewhat perverted one) -- take it one step further in comedy and bonding than the guys on Friends. Jeff is my favorite character. I love his quirky lines and immature behavior. My favorite episodes are ""Flushed,"" ""Size Matters,"" ""Sex, Death and Nudity,"" and ""The Girl with Two Breasts."" (The latter episode is the funniest one.) I got to see how Steve broke up with Jane and how he met Susan. And in that breakup and get-together, all six of them meet each other and become friends. I was not disappointed. The execution was great, especially during the first scenes of the episode ""Flushed."" In the hopes of saving both time and word space, I won't give a complete episode guide. I see that some reviewers have already done it. I just wanted to share my enthusiasm and utter satisfaction with the show's first season. Also, the DVD is quite good. It is far user-friendlier than the Sex and the City DVD in that each episode has a menu with scene choices -- something that SATC DVDs don't have for some reason.

With the many good reviews on Amazon, I will discuss the casual viewer who wants to try something new or have a curiousity of purchasing the ""Coupling"" series 1 DVD.  Friends who have enjoyed American shows like ""Friends"" and ""Sex and the City"" have asked if they should buy this DVD.  Let's just say that for each party that I go to, I bring this DVD along and show people who have never been exposed to a BBC show and guess...these people go out and buy the DVD.  That's right...it's that good!  The American version will be coming out soon (and I have screened the pilot alrady) but the BBC is way more funnier and sexier.  Are you and your friends always discussing sex, oh...this show is going to be a blast for you.  Where people can have something in common with the American show ""Friends"", I think many people and friends can find a lot in common with the characters of ""Coupling"". The stories are well written, trust me...once you pop this DVD in, I don't think you will able to stop it.  There are six episodes in series one and there are behind the scene interviews and a photo shoot and the DVD is just simply worth owning.  The only thing is that people not familiar with British culture may not understand certain words and there is no English subtitles available.  But fortunately, for this series, you can understand what they are saying and there are not many words thrown out that make you scratch your head and say ""huh?"".

725486,A2HBRINA3F9YHV,B0000797E5,Doctor Trance,"[5, 5]","Just some of the incredibly outrageous topics covered by arguably the funniest comedy in TV history (UK or US). Late one night back around 2002, I found this on a PBS station and couldn't recall laughing out loud like that in years. The side splitting antics of these 6 friends should be seen by anyone with a taste for humor, and an acceptance of risque subjects. Sex is definitely a major topic, as it is certainly a major part of the lives of twentysomethings living in London.We start the series with Steve breaking it off with Jane, only to hook up with Susan, which becomes a mainstay through the series. Patrick, Sally, and Jeff make up the rest of the sextet, with Richard Coyle as Jeff, being one of the all time great scene stealers in a comedic television show. His replacement in Series 4, while not a bad character or actor, simply cannot replace the talent that Coyle brought to the show. Enjoy him while you can, as he's only in it 'til season 3.Many of the plots involve misunderstandings, revelations, futile attempts at dating (mostly by Jeff), and hilarious conversations that take place when it's just the guys, or just the 3 girls together. It's an ingenious show, expertly created and written by the talented Steven Moffat, who is also responsible for some of the new Dr. Who stories on the BBC, and was a writer for the popular 80's British series Press Gang.You can compare it all you want to Friends, Seinfeld, and the like, but as it's own show, the storylines, dialogue, and interactions, among these 6 friends are truly unique, and incomparable to anything else on television.British humor (or any humor) at it's finest.  I've guaranteed all my friends and anyone else who will listen, that if they buy it and don't find it to be one of the funniest shows they've ever seen, that I would buy it back from them.

While several reviewers have mentioned the obvious parallels between Coupling and the American show Friends, Coupling is in my opinion much better.First of all, Coupling does not (largely) try to be as soapopera-ish (I really can't thing of another term) as Friends. At least in the first two seasons the jokes are the focus and consist primarily of one or two liners. The plots, such as they are, are kept simple and minimalist - basically serving as a platform for the humor, not the other way around.And the shows, while not for the prudish, are very funny. The episode, Inferno in particular is great fun. While the series revolves around Susan and Steve's relationship and as such they get the lion's share of attention, the funniest character is clearly Jeff.

Jack is trying to break up with his girlfriend Jane when he meets Susan.  As the first episode ends, Susan sums it all up by saying that the six of them are a couple, their two best friends and their two ex's.  These relationships are maintained pretty well throughout the current seasons.The storytelling is often very cleverly done by using flashbacks and multiple viewpoints.

By the end of the thirty minutes I was completely hooked on the racey conversations and situations that occurred in the lives of the wacky characters Steve, Patrick, Jeff, Susan, Sally, and of course, Jane.Many folks have comparatively called this show the British equivalent of ""Friends"".While there might superficially be some similarities, I think ""Coupling"" goes much further into farcial comedy territory. Many American network TV shows deal in euphemisms and double entendres when it comes to carnal situations.But the BBC's ""Coupling"" makes no bones about the fact it's primarily about SEX and the crazy situations we get ourselves into because of it.The characters on the show are often vain, shallow and often crazy. But they are also gut-wrenchingly funny as they spin away their endless, wacky theories & ideals about the opposite sex and how to navigate them into bed.These discourses on dealing with modern sexual politics usually leaves one or more of the characters naked and humiliated by the episode's end!My personal favorite characters are Jeff(an imbecile with his stories about having one leg and ear collections!) and the totally non-sensical, spacey, Jane (this generation's Gracie Allen).The show is witty, well written (often using ""Pulp Fiction"" like time shifts in story structure) and just plain out and out funny!

Patrick and Sally have a secret yen for one another but neither wants to be the first to say anything.  Jeff is a pervert.  And they all hang out at the same coffee shop.This popular British sex comedy is probably one of the most refreshing things to come off the television in a long time.  It addresses sex without being crass.  It's funny while being subtle and incisive.  Even the slapstick is controlled and precise.  No wonder American television, perennially strapped for creative ideas, is replicating it this fall.There are only six episodes in this complete first season, so it really is as brief as it feels.

725517,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0000797E5,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 3]","Yeah, ""Coupling"" is ""Friends"" set in England, but then ""St. Elsewhere"" was ""Hill Street Blues"" in a hospital and that worked out okay.  Besides, with all the attempts to duplicate the success of ""Friends"" on this side of the Pond it is nice to see that somebody pulled it off.  So just take it for granted that you will watch the first couple of episodes from the first series (what we in the Colonies would call a season) you will be figuring out which character on ""Coupling"" matches up with which character on ""Friends.""  But that is pretty obvious:Steve Taylor (Jack Davenport) is Ross, without the Ph.D. in paleontology, who has just started dating Susan Walker (Sarah Alexander), who certainly is more confident about living in the real world than Rachel.  Jane Christie (Gina Bellman) is decidedly quirky like Phoebe, but without the loveable cuteness, and Sally Harper (Kate Isitt) is psychotic about her appearance the way Monica is about cleanliness.  Jeff Murdock (Richard Coyle) thinks about sex as much as Joey without any of the success with women, which makes it odd that Patrick Maitland (Ben Miles) ends up being the Chandler figure since he is apparently a sex god (or sex ""donkey"").  When you get to the point knowing that Patrick is Susan's ""ex"" and it becomes impossible to translate that into Chandler being Rachel's ""ex,"" then you are capable of watching this situation comedy on its own terms.Now, the biggest difference between ""Coupling"" and ""Friends"" is the preoccupation with sex.  ""Coupling"" only had six episodes in its first series and I was wondering if you took the first season of ""Friends"" and selectively cut it down to only six episodes would it be as much about sex?  I have to say that the answer is probably not, even if you culled the choice moments from the first two or three season of 'Friends.""  Even when a subplot is about a job interview or a funeral, it still ends up about being sex.  To be honest, ""Sex in the City"" is not as much about sex as ""Coupling,"" which, you have to admit, has a more specific title in that regard.The six episodes from the first series are as follows: ""Flushed"" has Steve trying to break up with Jane, once again, and having problems because not only does Jane refuse to hear what he is saying, she reveals another side of herself that catches Steve's attention.  Then there is one of the most unusual circumstances for arranging for a date you have ever seen as Steve and Susan hook up.  ""Size Matters"" has Sally seeing Patrick in a new way, or, to be more accurate, hoping to see Patrick in a new way.  ""Sex, Death and Nudity"" has the gang showing up en masse at the funeral of Jane's aunt, although exactly who is with whom and what their relationship is for public consumption is not clear.  Bonus: The boys do their ""Reservoir Dogs"" bit.  ""Inferno"" is about the elephant in the living room at Steve and Susan's dinner party, namely the porn tape that Susan discovered in Steve's magazine.  Fortunately, Jane has brought her ex-therapist, although everybody assumes the newcomer is gay.  That is okay because she thinks Patrick is gay (because of his new hair style).  ""The Girl with Two Breasts"" has Jeff successfully having a conversation with a beautiful woman who still likes him.  That is probably because she is from Israel and only speaks Hebrew.  The comic highlight of the season is when Jeff has a second conversation with her; we hear it first from his perspective and then again from her perspective.  The first series comes to an end with ""The Cupboard of Patrick's Love,"" where it seems one of his collection of videotapes of his bedroom activities has the name ""Susan"" on it.  You do not need to be told this is not a good thing as far as Steve or Susan are concerned (although Jeff and Sally like the idea of it).Actually, the first series almost ended on a rather sweet note, but then they went for the gag, which is the whole object of ""Coupling.""  The show only tosses in one tag scene at the end of the credits, for ""Inferno,"" but it is a perfect capper to the episode and the issue of ""converting"" someone.  I am not surprised that the American version of ""Coupling"" failed because when the British talk about sex it tends to be funny, while when Americans talk about sex it tends to come across as smutty.  Talk about two people separated by a common language.  Anyhow, if you can get past the strong similarity with ""Friends"" and stop thinking of the show as a rip-off, you should be able to enjoy this raunchy and ribald little show.",5,Hey!

The six episode arc culminates in &quot;the Cupboard of Patrick's Love,&quot; an outrageous story about home-made erotic videotapes that brings the whole ensemble together in a very satisfying and typically hysterical fashion.  The DVD contains some good bonus features, most notably a series of behind-the-scenes interviews with all six cast members, writer Steven Moffat, and producer Sue Vertue.The strong sexual content of &quot;Coupling&quot; never seems gratuitous or tasteless--the topics seem to flow naturally from the characters and their life situations.

Creator Steven Moffat has not enough credit on doing this as he basically took original episodes from the British show and `cloned' them with the American cast (i.e. `Dressed' from season 2)The first season of `Coupling' is definitely one of the best seasons of this show.  People dared to compare this show with `Friends', well, the only thing in common is the fact that we have 6 people that know each other. This is a show as you have never seen one. The characters, their motifs and the situation are unbelievable funny. The way in which the stories are told is quite creative and well done; take for instance my personal favorite episode `The girl with two breasts' in which we get to see the same situation from both different perspectives with a twist so intelligently made that you won't believe it.Besides being the introduction for all the characters, the first season sets the events that will lead to the major changes to be seen on the next seasons. The show basically analyzes relationships and their ups and downs, situations that you may be familiar with (the nervousism on the first date, an ex-girlfriend asking you to go somewhere with her and asking you not to tell you are apart) and of course, sex. `Size matters' is about a guy feeling insecure about his size as he is competing with a `gifted' ex-boyfriend, `Sex, death and nudity' has the best gig of the season with the `giggle loop' (it made me cry of laughing) and the homage to reservoir dogs, `Inferno' has a serious discussion about porn films being works of art and `The cupboard of Patrick's love' introduces you to Casanova Patrick's video perversions.Witty, smart and with intelligent twists, this show will make you laugh over the six episodes of the first season. Scary Jeff became my favorite character with all the extravagant ideas about sex, his perversions and his obsession with his mom, Richard Coyle is just unbelievable as Jeff. This show takes the intelligent British humor to a whole new level. Highly recommendable, and season 2, gets better!The DVD extras are a few, some behind the scenes are included and images from the photo shot for the cover of the DVD are present as well.

725551,A1DUIWDZCNJIHA,B0000797E5,"Slade Simon ""slade37""","[0, 0]","This is one of the best British TV series I have ever watched. Comments on the BBC America ads make references to Friends and Sex in the City. I don't watch either one. The series focuses on how obsessive we are about things when dealing with relationships. In fact, it's based (loosely I'd imagine) on a real relationship. (Hint: look at the production credits - including the opening titles. The answer is in the extras on the DVD.)The series focuses on 6 friends - Steve, Susan, Jane, Sally, Jeff, and Patrick. However, the primary focus of the series is the development of the relationship between Steve and Susan. The first episode begins with their old relationships ending. Jane and Patrick are the exs, and they stick around as friends.Steve and Susan are the more ""normal"" ones of the group. Steve has a habit of getting into awkward situations. Susan is very open with sexual topics. (more so in later seasons)The others are a bit different. Each set of male and female friends have similar personality types. Although I've paired them up for comparison purposes, they are not in relationships with each other.Sally and Patrick are somewhat self-obsessed. Sally is totally focused on her appearance and even counts Susan's wrinkles. She seems to talk the most about her neck although bottoms and noses do get mentioned in later episodes. (Nose in second season.) Patrick is more self-centered. He is the stereotypical male who likes cars (assumes everyone else does too) and thinks every woman is a potential date. He feels he can convert lesbians. Also, as Susan puts it, Patrick is ""a very big boy indeed."" You'll find out what I mean in the second episode.Jane and Jeff are the odd ones with their own unusual views on life. Jane is probably also like a female version of Patrick, but Patrick doesn't seem insane. Jane views reality as centered on herself. Plus, she has her own unique views of reality. She is definitely not politically correct. She believes homosexual males still date women from time to time and heterosexual males may cuddle at times when convenient. However, this view may come from the fact she is bisexual, and, of course, reality must agree with her. Season 1 focuses on her getting over Steve's break-up with her. She is over it in season 2.Jeff is the one with extremely unusual theories and insights. When Steve talks about a long pause in a phone conversation, Jeff compares the pause to The Blob. He introduces us to The Giggle Loop (a type of feedback loop for laughter) The Sock Gap, and Nudity Buffer. He also has a few theories about celebrity marriages. Since he tends to always say the wrong thing (*really* wrong thing!), his best potential date is someone who doesn't speak English.This series was actually shot in 16x9. I had never really thought about the framing of the scenes. This is the first TV comedy I'd ever seen shot in a widescreen format. If you simply watch the BBC America broadcasts, I'm guessing about 1/4 of the image is missing (as with many full screen edition of movies on TV and video).The extras include the photo shoot (for the DVD packaging), the usual bio info on cast and crew, and interviews with cast members plus Steven Moffat and Sue Vertue.Trivia:Steven Moffat also worked on Comic Relief's Dr. Who: The Curse of the Fatal Death.",5,One of the Best of British Comedy - in Widescreen,1043452800,"01 25, 2003",2003,3312,"['one', 'best', 'British', 'TV', 'series', 'have', 'ever', 'watched', 'Comments', 'BBC', 'America', 'ads', 'make', 'references', 'Friends', 'Sex', 'City', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'one', 'series', 'how', 'obsessive', 'are', 'things', 'when', 'dealing', 'relationships', 'fact', 'based', 'loosely', ""'d"", 'imagine', 'real', 'relationship', 'Hint', 'look', 'production', 'credits', 'including', 'opening', 'titles', 'answer', 'extras', 'DVD', 'series', '6', 'friends', 'Steve', 'Susan', 'Jane', 'Sally', 'Jeff', 'Patrick', 'However', 'primary', 'focus', 'series', 'development', 'relationship', 'Steve', 'Susan', 'first', 'episode', 'old', 'relationships', 'ending', 'Jane', 'Patrick', 'are', 'exs', 'stick', 'around', 'friends.Steve', 'Susan', 'are', 'more', 'normal', 'ones', 'group', 'Steve', 'habit', 'getting', 'awkward', 'situations', 'Susan', 'very', 'open', 'sexual', 'topics', 'more', 'so', 'later', 'seasons', 'others', 'are', 'bit', 'different', 'set', 'male', 'female', 'friends', 'have', 'similar', 'personality', 'types', ""'ve"", 'paired', 'up', 'comparison', 'purposes', 'are', 'not', 'relationships', 'other.Sally', 'Patrick', 'are', 'somewhat', 'self-obsessed', 'Sally', 'totally', 'focused', 'appearance', 'even', 'Susan', 'wrinkles', 'talk', 'most', 'neck', 'bottoms', 'noses', 'do', 'get', 'mentioned', 'later', 'episodes', 'Nose', 'second', 'season', 'Patrick', 'more', 'self-centered', 'stereotypical', 'male', 'who', 'cars', 'everyone', 'else', 'too', 'woman', 'potential', 'date', 'can', 'convert', 'lesbians', 'Also', 'Susan', 'Patrick', 'very', 'big', 'boy', 'indeed', ""'ll"", 'find', 'out', 'what', 'mean', 'second', 'episode.Jane', 'Jeff', 'are', 'odd', 'ones', 'own', 'unusual', 'views', 'life', 'Jane', 'probably', 'also', 'female', 'version', 'Patrick', 'Patrick', ""n't"", 'seem', 'insane', 'Jane', 'views', 'reality', 'centered', 'own', 'unique', 'views', 'reality', 'definitely', 'not', 'politically', 'correct', 'homosexual', 'males', 'still', 'date', 'women', 'time', 'time', 'heterosexual', 'males', 'may', 'cuddle', 'times', 'when', 'convenient', 'However', 'view', 'may', 'come', 'fact', 'bisexual', 'course', 'reality', 'must', 'agree', 'Season', '1', 'focuses', 'getting', 'Steve', 'break-up', 'season', '2.Jeff', 'one', 'extremely', 'unusual', 'theories', 'insights', 'When', 'Steve', 'long', 'pause', 'phone', 'conversation', 'Jeff', 'pause', 'Blob', 'Giggle', 'Loop', 'type', 'feedback', 'loop', 'laughter', 'Sock', 'Gap', 'Nudity', 'Buffer', 'also', 'few', 'theories', 'celebrity', 'marriages', 'always', 'say', 'wrong', 'thing', '*really*', 'wrong', 'thing', 'best', 'potential', 'date', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'speak', 'English.This', 'series', 'was', 'actually', 'shot', '16x9', 'had', 'never', 'really', 'thought', 'framing', 'scenes', 'first', 'TV', 'comedy', ""'d"", 'ever', 'seen', 'shot', 'widescreen', 'format', 'simply', 'watch', 'BBC', 'America', ""'m"", 'guessing', '1/4', 'image', 'missing', 'many', 'full', 'screen', 'edition', 'movies', 'TV', 'video', 'extras', 'include', 'photo', 'shoot', 'DVD', 'packaging', 'usual', 'bio', 'info', 'cast', 'crew', 'interviews', 'cast', 'members', 'Steven', 'Moffat', 'Sue', 'Vertue.Trivia', 'Steven', 'Moffat', 'also', 'worked', 'Comic', 'Relief', 'Dr.', 'Who', 'Curse', 'Fatal', 'Death']",Coupling - The Complete First Season

Rivaling and actually exceeding the cleverness of other hits in comedy such as Friends.Coupling, too, is about a group of 6 close friends, and deals with their every day problems and relationships.In the first series, we are introduced to Steve, who is determined to break up with his girlfriend Jane and discusses this with his best friend Jeff. In their regular pub Steve runs into Susan (a colleague of Jeff), and sets a date with her. All this happens while he is having sex with Jane in the ladies' room.Susan breaks up with her boyfriend Patrick, and her best friend Sally decides Patrick is fair game. More so after hearing Patrick is well endowed in the nether region section.After the introduction episode, we get to see how Susan and Steve hook up together, and the crazy adventures the friends roll into. There's Jane's aunt dying, a discussion about Lesbian porn (the spanking kind), Jeff running into a stunner of a woman who doesn't immediately mace him, and Patrick's personal porn pile (starring Patrick).While each of the actors is equally brilliant, the genius and probably the reason Coupling is such a success is Jeff (Richard Coyle). His absurd experiences in life have caused him to come up with names for situations. You'll laugh your ass off while he explains the ""The Zone"", ""Unflushables"", ""The Sock Gap"" and most brilliantly, ""The Giggle Loop"".But you're not ready for that ;)A definite recommendation.
