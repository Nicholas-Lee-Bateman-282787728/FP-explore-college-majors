That's what it feels like. This could've been a great opportunity pick his mind about his work and show all the footage of his progression to today's success. But the blair-witch type of spoof that I saw, undermines my intelligence and leaves me disappointed to the point of being unable to stomach more than 20 minutes. I wanted a serious showcasing of a man and his talent, not bad acting and a weak premise of a spooky curse. I can understand the temptation to film in this quirky style, but ultimately, it wasn't done very well.

Everything you've ever seen (in the way of drama) on TV or in the movies is fake!! I don't quite understand why in this instance the fact that it is fake suddenly becomes a flaw. Unless of course you were tricked into thinking it was real, scared and then became angry when you found out you'd been hoodwinked! Similar to all of McKnight's movies he treats something that is generally believed to be fake (ghosts, aliens, and comic book heroes) and gives it an altogether serious treatment as if it were real. In this case the supposed mystery surrounding McKnight's life takes center stage. For those of you who want to know more about McKnight's thinking process in movie making you might try commentary tracks on some of his movies. But if you are looking for a 'Blair Witch' style mocumentary BY M.Knight you will love this. It also presents a chance for fans to see a little more of Knight's acting ability then his movie cameos allowed.

860320,A1HXP4PZYZE52M,B00064LJW8,MMAfan,"[10, 17]","This is probably scarier then any other movie or show I've ever seen in my life. M. Night Shymalan is a great writer/director and all his movies are great from beginning to end but this tells you about his life and how each movie is related to something he has seen or done in his life. First off they tell you about how he fell through ice at a lake and drowned when he was a young boy and that he died for a little and was brought back to life. He said he saw a dead boy (forget his name) that drowned in the same lake how long before while he was being brought back to life. They found pictures of a boy that M. Night drew while he was in school and he looked as if he was beaten or sick and that was said to be the boy he saw. They show M. Night walking around by himself talking to someone but there's no one there. When they tried to get M. Night to talk about it he got kind of mad and then all of a sudden an audio malfunction occurs.Well he has 4 movies out now linked to his life. As he said he saw a dead boy when he was being brought back to life and that occurred in the Sixth Sense in which the kid saw dead people. M. Night drowned in the lake because he swallowed the water to quickly where in Unbreakable the main characters weakness is water and he swallows it too quickly too and chokes on it. Also in the movie Signs the aliens weakness was water. They researched a little on the internet for his age period of when he drowned and it was completely gone. There was no record of his age period (I believe it was age 10-12) of when he drowned. And they eventually get the info from some guy on the internet and they visit the place where he lived when he drowned and it came out to be the same house that was in the movie Signs. No one lived in it and they walk in and hear something in one of the rooms. They open it up and a crow flies out. I kind of missed the reason for the crows. There would always seem to be a crow flying around M. Night like it was guarding him or watching him. They take the film that they had while in the house and slow mo it to see the crow and they see a ghost faded face in the background on a mirror and it looked exactly like the boy that M. Night drew.They also get into the movie The Village more because this was made right before it was released and lots of people didn't like it but it was much better if you saw this first.  They tell you about why M. Night is in all of his movies just for one small part.Well there's a lot more to this then what I told you but this is mostly what they base everything on. They have more interviews with a lot of people including Johnny Depp because he was M. Night's choice for the main character in Signs which Mel Gibson plays. They ask him why he didn't take the part and he has a good reason why but I'm not going to tell you. In this they see that he made all his movies in a certain area at a certain amount apart from each other. Like Sixth Sense and Unbreakable were made in Philadelphia, PA and The Village was made in West Chester, PA and Signs was also made near Philadelphia but I forget the exact spot.ALL ABOVE tells you why he doesn't have any commentaries on his DVD's if you are wondering.OVERALL this is a very interesting scary documentary about M. Night and his life and his movies and it kind of all comes together by the end and it will keep you up for days wondering if its real.",5,KIND OF LIKE A MOVIE,1098489600,"10 23, 2004",2004,3396,"['probably', 'scarier', 'then', 'other', 'movie', 'show', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'life', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shymalan', 'great', 'writer/director', 'movies', 'are', 'great', 'beginning', 'end', 'life', 'how', 'movie', 'related', 'something', 'seen', 'done', 'life', 'First', 'tell', 'how', 'fell', 'ice', 'lake', 'drowned', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'boy', 'died', 'little', 'was', 'brought', 'back', 'life', 'said', 'saw', 'dead', 'boy', 'forget', 'name', 'drowned', 'same', 'lake', 'how', 'long', 'before', 'was', 'being', 'brought', 'back', 'life', 'found', 'pictures', 'boy', 'M.', 'Night', 'drew', 'was', 'school', 'looked', 'was', 'beaten', 'sick', 'was', 'said', 'be', 'boy', 'saw', 'show', 'M.', 'Night', 'walking', 'around', 'talking', 'someone', 'one', 'there', 'When', 'tried', 'get', 'M.', 'Night', 'talk', 'got', 'kind', 'mad', 'then', 'sudden', 'audio', 'malfunction', 'occurs.Well', '4', 'movies', 'out', 'now', 'linked', 'life', 'said', 'saw', 'dead', 'boy', 'when', 'was', 'being', 'brought', 'back', 'life', 'occurred', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'kid', 'saw', 'dead', 'people', 'M.', 'Night', 'drowned', 'lake', 'swallowed', 'water', 'quickly', 'where', 'Unbreakable', 'main', 'characters', 'weakness', 'water', 'too', 'quickly', 'too', 'chokes', 'Also', 'movie', 'Signs', 'aliens', 'weakness', 'was', 'water', 'researched', 'little', 'internet', 'age', 'period', 'when', 'drowned', 'was', 'completely', 'gone', 'was', 'record', 'age', 'period', 'believe', 'was', 'age', '10-12', 'when', 'drowned', 'eventually', 'get', 'info', 'guy', 'internet', 'visit', 'place', 'where', 'lived', 'when', 'drowned', 'came', 'out', 'be', 'same', 'house', 'was', 'movie', 'Signs', 'one', 'lived', 'walk', 'hear', 'something', 'one', 'rooms', 'open', 'up', 'crow', 'out', 'kind', 'missed', 'reason', 'crows', 'would', 'always', 'seem', 'be', 'crow', 'flying', 'around', 'M.', 'Night', 'was', 'guarding', 'watching', 'take', 'film', 'had', 'house', 'slow', 'mo', 'see', 'crow', 'see', 'ghost', 'faded', 'face', 'background', 'mirror', 'looked', 'exactly', 'boy', 'M.', 'Night', 'drew.They', 'also', 'get', 'movie', 'Village', 'more', 'was', 'made', 'right', 'was', 'released', 'lots', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'saw', 'first', 'tell', 'why', 'M.', 'Night', 'movies', 'just', 'one', 'small', 'part.Well', 'lot', 'more', 'then', 'what', 'told', 'mostly', 'what', 'base', 'everything', 'have', 'more', 'interviews', 'lot', 'people', 'including', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'was', 'M.', 'Night', 'choice', 'main', 'character', 'Signs', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'plays', 'ask', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'part', 'good', 'reason', 'why', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'tell', 'see', 'made', 'movies', 'certain', 'area', 'certain', 'amount', 'apart', 'other', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Unbreakable', 'were', 'made', 'Philadelphia', 'PA', 'Village', 'was', 'made', 'West', 'Chester', 'PA', 'Signs', 'was', 'also', 'made', 'Philadelphia', 'forget', 'exact', 'spot.ALL', 'ABOVE', 'why', ""n't"", 'have', 'commentaries', 'DVD', 'are', 'wondering.OVERALL', 'very', 'interesting', 'scary', 'documentary', 'M.', 'Night', 'life', 'movies', 'kind', 'together', 'end', 'will', 'keep', 'up', 'days', 'wondering', 'real']",N/A
