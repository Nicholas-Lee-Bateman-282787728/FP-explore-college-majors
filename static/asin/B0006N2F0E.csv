That day never came THANK F'IN GOD! I can't tell you enough how bad this show is. Sure, everyone and their momma's hot in it (besides the goofy-goof ball, Kimmy. She's a witch!) and John Stamos (as usual) just oozes all that sexiness. I would...Anyway, back the review.If you don't remind me I'll always trail off into a world of bittersweet dreams filled with awesomely-charming Men such as John Stamos! b^_^;;I actually like DJ (Deej) and I saw a decent episode just today; her and her painfully-attractive boyfriend were having relationship troubles (although I think it was ALL in her pretty little mind): He was going off to college to leave her fending on her own with only a few calls and visits every couple of months. Trust me when I say I totally appreciate and bought her pain; I would feel the same if I had a life partner (or a boyfriend) who decided he wanted to go out-of-state (or wherever it was he wanted to go to attend schooling) and leave me lonely. I'd be a flipping mess!I don't think thing did work out in the end. He goes off and she just has to bite her lip and deal. The twins were cute but terrible, terrible actors.

Not sure what prompted the decision, but so far (I'm in season two) I'm glad I did. That being said, I feel like I have been a bit disillusioned. Little is the way I remember it:-Danny was not always a neat freak (in season two he vacuums the regular vacuum with a smaller one, but before then he does nothing like it)-Stephanie did not say How Rude! until halfway through season one-Jesse doesn't say have mercy until even later than that-Even the lyrics to the theme song aren't as I remember (it turns out they changed slightly over time)I was surprised to find the first few episodes super emotional. If anything, the premise of this comedy is shockingly depressing-Danny's wife dies, leaving him to care for his three daughters alone-but the show manages to strike a balance with this sadness by bringing in rocker musician Jesse (Danny's brother-in-law) and stand up comedian Joey (Danny's best friend).Watching Michelle (the Olsen Twins) grow up is also fascinating. We literally see them go from silent babies to walking and talking toddlers and beyond. It is strange to see someone actually play their own age on television, which is such a rarity these days. Though they never look unhappy on the show, Mary Kate apparently regrets her childhood years on set.I find myself appreciating DJ much more than before-she is the one who pulls in the tears most because she is the only one old enough to understand the bigger picture of what is going on. She is old enough to truly understand that her mother is gone and express those feelings.

So this is not going to be one of many ""OMG teh olsan twinz is teh suxx0rs!!!!111eleven!!"" reviews that I'm sure are bound to flood this item's review list. But I will be brutally honest.Like everyone else, I watched this show during its heyday. However, I have watched many reruns of this show much more recently, and I found out much to my surprise that it's COMPLETELY NOT FUNNY. The funniest sitcoms of all time are all about extremely dysfunctional people making idiots of themselves and each other; it's sad, but true. Full House is about the everyday adventures of a bunch of normal, loving, and thoroughly boring people. I think most people hear funnier dialogue in their own real lives each day than they do in a typical FH episode. And things got very old very quickly; you can only hear so many jokes about Danny's cleanliness or Joey's immaturity before they lose what little comedic value they originally had.When FH wasn't even trying to be funny, it was even worse. I could swear that the audience was cued to say ""Awwwww"" at specific points during each episode, and too many episodes end with one character or another learning a Very Valuable Lesson(TM) and/or hugging each other. Would you like some saccharine with your sugar?To add insult to injury, back when FH was being made, the Olsens' acting abilities had not yet... uh... existed.

871440,AYEXFNKGFRL4W,B0006N2F0E,J. McAndrew,"[1, 5]","Full House isn't my favorite television show of all time. In fact it's not even in the top 100, but in retrospect it really wasn't all that bad.  The show premiered in the late 1980s about a recently widowed father with three young daughters. To help him take care of his girls, his brother in law (Jesse) and his friend (Joey) move into the house. The first season of the show employed all of the lame typical jokes about men trying to take care of children that you might expect. The same jokes that have been overused in movies like Mr. Mom, Three Men and a Baby, Daddy Daycare, and most recently The Pacifier. A man being ignorant about how to change a child's diaper may have been funny 30 years ago, but in todays society that stereotype is getting old. The fashions in the show are extremley dated (even for the late 1980s) and main charactes sport mullets. It is true that the cast of the show is not as picturesque as many TV shows today and the girl's cuteness comes off as just annoying at many times but the show still has some redeeming qualities as well.  This is a family comedy with the underlying theme about the loss of a wife and parent. It isn't easy to keep a show light and funny while still discussing life and death but Full House pulls it off rather nicely. The show would have benifited from removal of the constant laugh tracks and the ""awwws"" that chime in every time there is a serious moment.  The show may be too sugery sweet and sentimental for some viewers but the love that the characters show for eachother looks authentic.

871441,A19XE6G6NDZFPS,B0006N2F0E,Joanna Mechlinski,"[0, 1]","In Season 1 of this long-running sitcom, talk show host Danny Tanner and his three daughters, 13-year-old DJ, 5-year-old Stephanie and baby Michelle are still adjusting to the death of their wife and mother in a car crash several months earlier. To help raise the girls, Danny has asked his brother-in-law Jesse and best friend Joey to move in with them.Much of the comedy comes from Jesse and Joey - confirmed bachelors without much experience with children - attempting to take care of the girls. Especially with baby Michelle, this results in many ""Three Men and a Baby""-type gags.Meanwhile, DJ is experiencing many of the typical problems of adolescent girls, while Stephanie is just beginning to learn about the larger world beyond her family, in kindergarten and beyond. Like any other sisters, they squabble and fuss, but support one another whenever there's a need.Many - including myself - may be somewhat irritated by the laugh track. If Stephanie says something funny, we should be smart enough to figure it out ourselves, and if the baby does something cute, do they need to hammer it home by having an ""AWWWW!"" in the background? Also, no matter the crisis of the week, it's always resolved within a half hour timeframe...including commercials.Nonetheless, this show does have its merits. It's clean comedy, suitable for families to watch together, and there's always some moral tied into whatever's going on in the Tanner household.",4,The show we '80s kids grew up watching...,1166572800,"12 20, 2006",2006,1446,"['Season', '1', 'long-running', 'sitcom', 'talk', 'show', 'host', 'Danny', 'Tanner', 'three', 'daughters', '13-year-old', 'DJ', '5-year-old', 'Stephanie', 'baby', 'Michelle', 'are', 'still', 'adjusting', 'death', 'wife', 'mother', 'car', 'crash', 'several', 'months', 'earlier', 'help', 'raise', 'girls', 'Danny', 'asked', 'brother-in-law', 'Jesse', 'best', 'friend', 'Joey', 'move', 'them.Much', 'comedy', 'Jesse', 'Joey', 'confirmed', 'bachelors', 'much', 'experience', 'children', 'attempting', 'take', 'care', 'girls', 'Especially', 'baby', 'Michelle', 'results', 'many', 'Three', 'Men', 'Baby', '-type', 'gags.Meanwhile', 'DJ', 'experiencing', 'many', 'typical', 'problems', 'adolescent', 'girls', 'Stephanie', 'just', 'beginning', 'learn', 'larger', 'world', 'family', 'kindergarten', 'other', 'sisters', 'squabble', 'fuss', 'support', 'one', 'whenever', 'need.Many', 'including', 'may', 'be', 'somewhat', 'irritated', 'laugh', 'track', 'Stephanie', 'something', 'funny', 'should', 'be', 'smart', 'enough', 'figure', 'out', 'baby', 'something', 'cute', 'do', 'need', 'hammer', 'home', 'having', 'AWWWW', 'background', 'Also', 'matter', 'crisis', 'week', 'always', 'resolved', 'half', 'hour', 'timeframe', 'including', 'commercials.Nonetheless', 'show', 'have', 'merits', 'clean', 'comedy', 'suitable', 'families', 'watch', 'together', 'always', 'moral', 'tied', 'going', 'Tanner', 'household']",N/A

Watching the first season of Full House made me miss the days when television was actually worth watching.The first season introduces us to the Tanner family- recently widowed Danny invites his friend Joey and brother-in-law Jesse to move in to watch his three daughters... the strange group of misfit dads looks upon the task as enormously difficult causing for some hillarous moments from the first day of school, to changing a baby's diaper, and basic upkeeping of the house and upbringing of the girls. The Tanner girls D.J. (Candance Cameron), Stephanie (Jodie Sweten), and Michelle (Mary Kate & Ashley Olsen) are simple adorable... especially young Michelle who attaches quickly to Jesse & Joey.In a sense the show is an idealistic look on what family life is like and is sweet given the circumstances in which the family is brought together- the girls seem happy, healthy and well taken care of despite the lack of their mom.  There is a lot of 80s cheese- but nice cheese in which life's problems are solved with  a hug, a smile, and a kind word. In truth we ALL wish our family's life could be as simple as the show.

871454,A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,B0006N2F0E,Mark Baker,"[15, 17]","Life has dealt Danny Tanner (Bob Saget) a hard blow.  A drunk driver has killed his wife and he's left to raise his three daughters on his own.  Knowing he needs help, he asks his best friend Joey (Dave Coulier) and brother-in-law Jesse (John Stamos) to move into his house and help him raise his three daughters, 10 year old DJ (Candace Cameron), 5 year old Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin) and nine month old Michelle (Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen in their first role).  Of course, they know nothing about raising kids, but they agree.The result is this crazy mix of fun.  While all three of the guys try to figure out what they are doing, the girls deal with the changes in their lives.  DJ and Stephanie have to share a room.  Joey is living in an alcove in the living room.  And no one knows how to cook or clean, much less change Michelle's diaper.  Combine that with chicken pox, school, and some different personalities, and you have the first season of this fun sit-com.I've just recently started watching the show via reruns, and I've gotten so addicted I had to get this set.  Even being relatively new, I recognized some things that were different this first season.  Ok, yes, besides the 80's hair on Joey and Jesse.  Compulsive cleaner Danny doesn't know how to clean here.  Jesse's last name is Cochran.  Joey is sleeping in the living room (something that changes in the wonderful ""Joey's Place."")  The only catch phrase we really hear is ""Have mercy!""  DJ's best friend Kimmy (Andrea Barber) is around, but only in a hand full of episodes.However, the heart of the show is still there.  Not only does every problem get solved in 23 minutes, but usually with a heart to heart talk.  And let me tell you, this show can tug at your heartstrings while making you laugh.  Not to say the show isn't cheesy and corny at times.  It's still highly entertaining.Of course, all the actors help the show.  The adults do great in their roles.  But it's the kids that blow me away.  Both Candace Cameron and Jodie Sweetin really nail the parts.  They are born actresses.  Mary-Kate and Ashley are adorable as Michelle, thanks in part to the editing of the scenes and the patience of the rest of the cast.Not only does this set contain the 22 episodes from season one, but we also get some cool extras.  The original unaired pilot is included.  The difference is John Posey is playing the role of Danny.  That's pretty much it.  Even the guest stars are the same.  While it feels funny watching someone else in the role, it's nice to have.  There are also two interesting commentary tracks from series creator Jeff Franklin.  While he spends minimal time talking about those specific episodes, he shares lots of memories of creating, casting, and filming the first season.  Finally, there's a marginally interesting pop-up trivia track on ""The Miracle of Thanksgiving.""Like so much else that I recommend, this show was never going to be an award winner.  But it is fun and entertaining, and that's all it takes to please me.  If you are as easy to please as I am, you'll love this show.",5,"Three Men, Two Little Ladies, and a Baby",1156896000,"08 30, 2006",2006,3079,"['Life', 'dealt', 'Danny', 'Tanner', 'Bob', 'Saget', 'hard', 'blow', 'drunk', 'driver', 'killed', 'wife', 'left', 'raise', 'three', 'daughters', 'own', 'Knowing', 'help', 'best', 'friend', 'Joey', 'Dave', 'Coulier', 'brother-in-law', 'Jesse', 'John', 'Stamos', 'move', 'house', 'help', 'raise', 'three', 'daughters', '10', 'year', 'old', 'DJ', 'Candace', 'Cameron', '5', 'year', 'old', 'Stephanie', 'Jodie', 'Sweetin', 'nine', 'month', 'old', 'Michelle', 'Mary-Kate', 'Ashley', 'Olsen', 'first', 'role', 'course', 'know', 'nothing', 'raising', 'kids', 'agree.The', 'result', 'crazy', 'mix', 'fun', 'three', 'guys', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'girls', 'deal', 'changes', 'lives', 'DJ', 'Stephanie', 'have', 'share', 'room', 'Joey', 'living', 'alcove', 'living', 'room', 'one', 'how', 'cook', 'clean', 'much', 'less', 'change', 'Michelle', 'diaper', 'Combine', 'chicken', 'pox', 'school', 'different', 'personalities', 'have', 'first', 'season', 'fun', 'sit-com.I', ""'ve"", 'just', 'recently', 'started', 'watching', 'show', 'reruns', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'so', 'addicted', 'had', 'get', 'set', 'Even', 'being', 'relatively', 'new', 'recognized', 'things', 'were', 'different', 'first', 'season', 'Ok', 'yes', '80', 'hair', 'Joey', 'Jesse', 'Compulsive', 'cleaner', 'Danny', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'clean', 'here', 'Jesse', 'last', 'name', 'Cochran', 'Joey', 'sleeping', 'living', 'room', 'something', 'wonderful', 'Joey', 'Place', 'only', 'catch', 'phrase', 'really', 'hear', 'Have', 'mercy', 'DJ', 'best', 'friend', 'Kimmy', 'Andrea', 'Barber', 'around', 'only', 'hand', 'full', 'episodes.However', 'heart', 'show', 'still', 'there', 'Not', 'only', 'problem', 'get', 'solved', '23', 'minutes', 'usually', 'heart', 'heart', 'talk', 'let', 'tell', 'show', 'can', 'tug', 'heartstrings', 'making', 'laugh', 'Not', 'say', 'show', ""n't"", 'cheesy', 'corny', 'times', 'still', 'highly', 'entertaining.Of', 'course', 'actors', 'help', 'show', 'adults', 'do', 'great', 'roles', 'kids', 'blow', 'away', 'Candace', 'Cameron', 'Jodie', 'Sweetin', 'really', 'parts', 'are', 'born', 'actresses', 'Mary-Kate', 'Ashley', 'are', 'adorable', 'Michelle', 'thanks', 'part', 'editing', 'scenes', 'patience', 'rest', 'cast.Not', 'only', 'set', 'contain', '22', 'episodes', 'season', 'one', 'also', 'get', 'cool', 'extras', 'original', 'unaired', 'pilot', 'included', 'difference', 'John', 'Posey', 'playing', 'role', 'Danny', 'pretty', 'much', 'Even', 'guest', 'stars', 'are', 'same', 'funny', 'watching', 'someone', 'else', 'role', 'nice', 'have', 'are', 'also', 'two', 'interesting', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'series', 'creator', 'Jeff', 'Franklin', 'minimal', 'time', 'talking', 'specific', 'episodes', 'shares', 'lots', 'memories', 'creating', 'casting', 'filming', 'first', 'season', 'Finally', 'marginally', 'interesting', 'pop-up', 'trivia', 'track', 'Miracle', 'Thanksgiving', 'so', 'much', 'recommend', 'show', 'was', 'never', 'going', 'be', 'award', 'winner', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'please', 'are', 'easy', 'please', 'am', ""'ll"", 'love', 'show']",N/A

871460,A2BNNU4ELFKK4N,B0006N2F0E,MollyRK,"[3, 5]","Those of us who were kids when this show first aired may not remember how much danger ""Full House"" was in after wrapping up its first season. With horrible reviews and even Jarnette Olsen's reluctance to let her baby daughters Mary-Kate and Ashley continue playing ""Michelle,"" the prospects of having a successful long-running series did not look good.Fortunately, the show was renewed for a second season and, as we all know now, remained on air for 8 solid years. The critics continued to tear it to shreds but the fans adored it, which easily explains why these DVD sales have produced such positive results.Back to Season 1...it was a year for the plot to be established and the characters to find their necessary footing. The actresses playing the Tanner kids--ages 1, 5 and 9 at the time--were very young and weren't quite able to contribute as much to the storylines as they did in later seasons. Bob Saget, Dave Coulier and John Stamos were originally given the most screen time and made for some very funny scenes, but in the end it was clearly important to bring the kids into the scene as much as possible. The ""family show"" formula couldn't be carried out if it was primarily the 3 guys cracking jokes. This was one noticeable change that was made for Season 2, and that helped make the series more successful.I think once baby Michelle began talking and spouting out those classic lines (e.g. ""You got it dude!"") the show was able to really take off. (You may love or hate the Olsen twins, but few can deny that her adorable face and cute dialogue was a necessary staple in the show's success.) In short, Season 1 was a shaky one and definitely not my favorite, but of course I own the DVD and enjoy watching the episodes to see how far the characters have come since then.The special features on this set are actually very good--certainly the best out of the 3 seasons that have been released on DVD so far. There are commentaries for 2 episodes, as well as a completely different filmed pilot. The plot was the same, but there was a different Danny Tanner: John Posey. Some people may be surprised to know that when it appeared that Saget was not going to be able to play the role, they chose Posey and even shot the pilot episode with him. It's really a very sad story: the pilot was made and Posey all ready to start filming for Season 1, and Bob Saget's schedule opened up. Suddenly, Saget was in and Posey was out.It was incredibly interesting to watch this original pilot and see the kind of actor they initially chose to portray Danny Tanner. Posey was a lot more laid-back and carefree in personality, and his version of Danny didn't seem as overprotective of his daughters as Saget's rendition. Posey actually reminded me a lot of Joey. It's interesting to think about how different ""Full House"" would have been if he had stayed in there--not necessarily good or bad, but just really different.With the first 3 seasons of ""Full House"" already released on DVD and Season 4 unofficially scheduled for late summer, long-time fans of this positive feel-good family sitcom can look forward to continuing their collections!",3,a rough inaugural season but still great for fans,1146268800,"04 29, 2006",2006,3140,"['who', 'were', 'kids', 'when', 'show', 'first', 'aired', 'may', 'not', 'remember', 'how', 'much', 'danger', 'Full', 'House', 'was', 'wrapping', 'up', 'first', 'season', 'horrible', 'reviews', 'even', 'Jarnette', 'Olsen', 'reluctance', 'let', 'baby', 'daughters', 'Mary-Kate', 'Ashley', 'continue', 'playing', 'Michelle', 'prospects', 'having', 'successful', 'long-running', 'series', 'did', 'not', 'look', 'good.Fortunately', 'show', 'was', 'renewed', 'second', 'season', 'know', 'now', 'remained', 'air', '8', 'solid', 'years', 'critics', 'continued', 'tear', 'shreds', 'fans', 'adored', 'easily', 'why', 'DVD', 'sales', 'have', 'produced', 'such', 'positive', 'results.Back', 'Season', '1', 'was', 'year', 'plot', 'be', 'established', 'characters', 'find', 'necessary', 'footing', 'actresses', 'playing', 'Tanner', 'kids', '1', '5', '9', 'time', 'were', 'very', 'young', 'were', ""n't"", 'quite', 'able', 'contribute', 'as', 'much', 'storylines', 'did', 'later', 'seasons', 'Bob', 'Saget', 'Dave', 'Coulier', 'John', 'Stamos', 'were', 'originally', 'given', 'most', 'screen', 'time', 'made', 'very', 'funny', 'scenes', 'end', 'was', 'clearly', 'important', 'bring', 'kids', 'scene', 'as', 'much', 'possible', 'family', 'show', 'formula', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'carried', 'was', 'primarily', '3', 'guys', 'cracking', 'jokes', 'was', 'one', 'noticeable', 'change', 'was', 'made', 'Season', '2', 'helped', 'make', 'series', 'more', 'successful.I', 'think', 'once', 'baby', 'Michelle', 'began', 'talking', 'spouting', 'out', 'classic', 'lines', 'e.g', 'got', 'dude', 'show', 'was', 'able', 'really', 'take', 'off', 'may', 'love', 'hate', 'Olsen', 'twins', 'few', 'can', 'deny', 'adorable', 'face', 'cute', 'dialogue', 'was', 'necessary', 'staple', 'show', 'success', 'short', 'Season', '1', 'was', 'shaky', 'one', 'definitely', 'not', 'favorite', 'course', 'own', 'DVD', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'episodes', 'see', 'how', 'far', 'characters', 'have', 'come', 'then.The', 'special', 'features', 'set', 'are', 'actually', 'very', 'good', 'certainly', 'best', '3', 'seasons', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'so', 'far', 'are', 'commentaries', '2', 'episodes', 'as', 'well', 'completely', 'different', 'filmed', 'pilot', 'plot', 'was', 'same', 'there', 'was', 'different', 'Danny', 'Tanner', 'John', 'Posey', 'people', 'may', 'be', 'surprised', 'know', 'when', 'appeared', 'Saget', 'was', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'able', 'play', 'role', 'chose', 'Posey', 'even', 'shot', 'pilot', 'episode', 'really', 'very', 'sad', 'story', 'pilot', 'was', 'made', 'Posey', 'ready', 'start', 'filming', 'Season', '1', 'Bob', 'Saget', 'schedule', 'opened', 'up', 'Suddenly', 'Saget', 'was', 'Posey', 'was', 'out.It', 'was', 'incredibly', 'interesting', 'watch', 'original', 'pilot', 'see', 'kind', 'actor', 'initially', 'chose', 'portray', 'Danny', 'Tanner', 'Posey', 'was', 'lot', 'more', 'laid-back', 'carefree', 'personality', 'version', 'Danny', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'overprotective', 'daughters', 'Saget', 'rendition', 'Posey', 'actually', 'reminded', 'lot', 'Joey', 'interesting', 'think', 'how', 'different', 'Full', 'House', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'stayed', 'there', 'not', 'necessarily', 'good', 'bad', 'just', 'really', 'different.With', 'first', '3', 'seasons', 'Full', 'House', 'already', 'released', 'DVD', 'Season', '4', 'unofficially', 'scheduled', 'late', 'summer', 'long-time', 'fans', 'positive', 'feel-good', 'family', 'sitcom', 'can', 'look', 'forward', 'continuing', 'collections']",N/A

Murrow, the late CBS news reporter and spiritual father of broadcast journalism, remarked after seeing an early, experimental television broadcast that ""this medium will either become the most important, infulential, and provactive tool mankind has yet developed or; alternatively, may become simply a lot of lights and wires in a box.""Folks, let me make something perfectly clear. Before the now-legendary evening of September 29, 1987, when the first half-hour episode of ""Full House"" premeired on the American Broadcast Network (ABC), televsion was well on its way to degenerating into just the sort of mechanical, vapid, hackneyed amusement device that Murrow feared it might someday become. Televison had for years been churning out a callous, shopworn parade of programs that utterly failed to utilize the medium's true capacity to enlighten, both intellectually and spiritually, the viewing public. Then, like the first glimpse of land after decades at sea, we saw ""Full House"" glow like a shining beacon on the horizon, a sitcom lighthouse come to brighten our way to shore. As the theme song so majestically refrained, ""When you're lost out there, and you're all alone, A light is waiting, to carry you ho-ooo-oome Everywhere you look! Da-duh-du-due-da-da-da!""Not since the death of Lenny Bruce has the American public been treated to a comedic genuis of the caliber of Bob Saget. Saget brought the boxcutter-sharp wit of his stand-up routine to the small screen, and now, with the long-overdue release of ""Full House"" on DVD, a new generation can reverently embrace the madcap antics of Danny Tanner, his pal Joey, brother-in-law Jesse, and daughters DJ, Steph, and Michelle. Much as comics of the 90s listened to Lenny Bruce albums to hone their routines, so will the stand-uppers of tomorrow watch ""Full House"" to see a virtuoso in action, a comedic trailblazer light-years ahead of his time. The comedic earthquake ""Full House"" unleashed reverberated throughout the TV world. Dare I say that, without ""Full House,"" there could never have been a ""Blossom.""  My sincere hope is that the scripts of this program are someday transcribed and preserved at the Smithsonian Institute's History of Televsion display, replacing the relics of lower-quality fare like ""All in the Family"" and ""The Honeymooners.""For although Carrol O'Connor and Jackie Gleason were talented actors, both of them put together could never match the comic brillance of Dave Coulier doing his spot-on Popeye and Bullwinkle impersonation, or the precocious talent of Mary-Kate Olsen slicing off John Stamos's mullet right before his killer gig singing Kokomo with the one living Beach Boy. Like many of you, I will treasure the digital copy of this television masterpiece for the rest of my born days. And to those of you who think ""Full House"" deserves a ""Straight Flush,"" I say to you this: ""How rude!""",5,The greatest sitcom in telvision history!,1110240000,"03 8, 2005",2005,2892,"['Edward', 'R.', 'Murrow', 'late', 'CBS', 'news', 'reporter', 'spiritual', 'father', 'broadcast', 'journalism', 'remarked', 'seeing', 'early', 'experimental', 'television', 'broadcast', 'medium', 'will', 'become', 'most', 'important', 'infulential', 'provactive', 'tool', 'mankind', 'yet', 'developed', 'alternatively', 'may', 'become', 'simply', 'lot', 'lights', 'wires', 'box', 'Folks', 'let', 'make', 'something', 'perfectly', 'clear', 'now-legendary', 'evening', 'September', '29', '1987', 'when', 'first', 'half-hour', 'episode', 'Full', 'House', 'premeired', 'American', 'Broadcast', 'Network', 'ABC', 'televsion', 'was', 'well', 'way', 'degenerating', 'just', 'sort', 'mechanical', 'vapid', 'hackneyed', 'amusement', 'device', 'Murrow', 'feared', 'might', 'someday', 'become', 'Televison', 'had', 'years', 'been', 'churning', 'out', 'callous', 'shopworn', 'parade', 'programs', 'utterly', 'failed', 'utilize', 'medium', 'true', 'capacity', 'enlighten', 'intellectually', 'spiritually', 'viewing', 'public', 'Then', 'first', 'glimpse', 'land', 'decades', 'sea', 'saw', 'Full', 'House', 'glow', 'shining', 'beacon', 'horizon', 'sitcom', 'lighthouse', 'come', 'brighten', 'way', 'shore', 'theme', 'song', 'so', 'majestically', 'refrained', 'When', ""'re"", 'lost', 'there', ""'re"", 'alone', 'light', 'waiting', 'carry', 'ho-ooo-oome', 'Everywhere', 'look', 'Da-duh-du-due-da-da-da', 'Not', 'death', 'Lenny', 'Bruce', 'American', 'public', 'been', 'treated', 'comedic', 'genuis', 'caliber', 'Bob', 'Saget', 'Saget', 'brought', 'boxcutter-sharp', 'wit', 'stand-up', 'routine', 'small', 'screen', 'now', 'long-overdue', 'release', 'Full', 'House', 'DVD', 'new', 'generation', 'can', 'reverently', 'embrace', 'madcap', 'antics', 'Danny', 'Tanner', 'pal', 'Joey', 'brother-in-law', 'Jesse', 'daughters', 'DJ', 'Steph', 'Michelle', 'Much', 'comics', '90s', 'listened', 'Lenny', 'Bruce', 'albums', 'hone', 'routines', 'so', 'will', 'stand-uppers', 'tomorrow', 'watch', 'Full', 'House', 'see', 'virtuoso', 'action', 'comedic', 'trailblazer', 'light-years', 'ahead', 'time', 'comedic', 'earthquake', 'Full', 'House', 'unleashed', 'reverberated', 'TV', 'world', 'Dare', 'say', 'Full', 'House', 'could', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'Blossom', 'sincere', 'hope', 'scripts', 'program', 'are', 'someday', 'transcribed', 'preserved', 'Smithsonian', 'Institute', 'History', 'Televsion', 'display', 'replacing', 'relics', 'lower-quality', 'fare', 'Family', 'Honeymooners', 'Carrol', ""O'Connor"", 'Jackie', 'Gleason', 'were', 'talented', 'actors', 'put', 'together', 'could', 'never', 'match', 'comic', 'brillance', 'Dave', 'Coulier', 'doing', 'spot-on', 'Popeye', 'Bullwinkle', 'impersonation', 'precocious', 'talent', 'Mary-Kate', 'Olsen', 'slicing', 'off', 'John', 'Stamos', 'mullet', 'right', 'killer', 'gig', 'singing', 'Kokomo', 'one', 'living', 'Beach', 'Boy', 'many', 'will', 'treasure', 'digital', 'copy', 'television', 'masterpiece', 'rest', 'born', 'days', 'who', 'think', 'Full', 'House', 'Straight', 'Flush', 'say', 'How', 'rude']",N/A

This is a great story about a family coming together in a time of need.  Not only is this series good, but it also gives examples of real life issues for kids to try to connect with.  We have all that time where we need glasses and never wanted them, body size issues, times of not feeling good enough about ourselves, etc.  This show presents so many situations for people to relate to.  This show is sweet to the core.  Danny is in trouble when his wife is killed and he is left to raise his three daughters.  He has to make a lot of life adjustments for these girls, but he is more than willing to.  As the girls start to grow up, they have Joey and Jesse in their lives to also help them throughout their lives.  The girls struggle at times facing that they do not have a mother.  The girls seem to get along fine in their lives with Danny, Joey, Jesse, and later Becky.  This is a show that I would recommend to anyone.

871465,A2LNEZD3YBO12O,B0006N2F0E,Preston,"[6, 10]","To which I say--Long overdue for Full House to come on DVD!  I thought the first show showed promise.  I saw about half of that first season when it came in 1987-1988. But no one seemed to notice when it kept finishing 56th, 57th, 61st and other numbers in the ratings most weeks. It finally took the third and fourth seasons for the show to move into the top 10 and 20. I still feel that John Stamos and Candace Cameron were the best actors in that show. I thought this was a huge jump for John after two seasons of the underrated NBC comedy You Again in 1986-1987. The Olsen twins were adorable. Even though they're now in college, to most of us, it's this show that their likeness started.  Wasn't too crazy about Bob Saget--perhaps the blandest actor to play a dad's role. But the family themes and messages are deep, no matter how charming, no matter how cloying or sappy, no matter how many Awwwwwwwwwwwws the studio audience was shouting on the show. I thought Dave Coulier's funny imitations of cartoon characters, especially Popeye were quite good.  Miller/Boyett Productions had a period of such dynamic family shows in House, Family Matters and Step By Step, three of them in ABC's popular TGIF lineup in the '90s.  I remember that they did Happy Days from seeing their closing credits of that show. Full House succeeded with the Tanner family all together, even as the father was looking out for the kids.  Lori Loughlin's character was like the mother for the kids, even if she didn't live with the Tanners.  But the setting in San Francisco was nice--saw the Golden Gate bridge and the steep hills countless times in the openings.

To me, this is just good, healthy entertainment.  I've never found another sitcom that can give the inspiration lessons and good family entertainment like Full House has -- and that's why I feel that Full House is irreplaceable.Overall I was pleased with the The Complete First Season of Full House (although I do like the newer episodes more -- probably because I remember them better... go figure).The First Season pack does offer some special features.  On the first disc, there is the Original Unaired Pilot with John Posey playing the role of Danny Tanner as opposed to Bob Saget (after watching I was very pleased that Bob Saget was able to do the part because I don't think the sitcom wouldn't have lasted as long as it did without Bob).  The episode is pretty much the same as the one that is aired with a few line changes.  And also the the first CD there is the optional commentary from Jeff Franklin on 'Our Very First Show', which I thought gave some interesting information on casting and creating the show.  On the second disc, there is the House of Trivia Fast-Fact Version of the Miracle of Thanksgiving, where there is just fun facts popping up at the bottom of the screen during the episode.  Then on disc four, there is another optional commentary from Jeff Franklin during the episode Mad Money.Each of the episodes begin with the extended version of the opening credits, which probably only aired during the first episode of the season.  Typically ABC would broadcast the shortened version.  Personally, I liked having the extended version, because I really don't recall ever seeing it before from this season, and if I did I probably wouldn't remember it.  However, I did think they should've had the shortened version on all but the first episode just because that was, afterall, what was always broadcasted.  I would just like to see what I used to see every time I would click on the channel to watch Full House.As for the DVD's themselves -- they are on four discs, which is nice, however, the case that they are in is not the best.  The case is set up so the discs overlap each other and they don't seem to stay in place because of it.Overall, I think it's a great DVD set for any Full House fan.  If you're not a fan of Full House, don't get it -- it's as simple as that.As for me, I love it, and I can't wait for the second season!",5,Good Entertainment,1117497600,"05 31, 2005",2005,2472,"[""'m"", 'currently', '18', 'years', 'old', 'same', 'age', 'Olsen', 'Twins', 'have', 'grown', 'up', 'show', 'just', 'good', 'healthy', 'entertainment', ""'ve"", 'never', 'found', 'sitcom', 'can', 'give', 'inspiration', 'lessons', 'good', 'family', 'entertainment', 'Full', 'House', 'why', 'feel', 'Full', 'House', 'irreplaceable.Overall', 'was', 'pleased', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season', 'Full', 'House', 'do', 'newer', 'more', 'probably', 'remember', 'better', 'go', 'figure', '.The', 'First', 'Season', 'pack', 'offer', 'special', 'features', 'first', 'disc', 'Original', 'Unaired', 'Pilot', 'John', 'Posey', 'playing', 'role', 'Danny', 'Tanner', 'opposed', 'Bob', 'Saget', 'watching', 'was', 'very', 'pleased', 'Bob', 'Saget', 'was', 'able', 'do', 'part', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'sitcom', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'lasted', 'as', 'long', 'did', 'Bob', 'episode', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'one', 'aired', 'few', 'line', 'changes', 'also', 'first', 'CD', 'optional', 'commentary', 'Jeff', 'Franklin', ""'Our"", 'Very', 'First', 'Show', 'thought', 'gave', 'interesting', 'information', 'casting', 'creating', 'show', 'second', 'disc', 'House', 'Trivia', 'Fast-Fact', 'Version', 'Miracle', 'Thanksgiving', 'where', 'just', 'fun', 'facts', 'popping', 'up', 'bottom', 'screen', 'episode', 'Then', 'disc', 'four', 'optional', 'commentary', 'Jeff', 'Franklin', 'episode', 'Mad', 'Money.Each', 'episodes', 'begin', 'extended', 'version', 'opening', 'credits', 'probably', 'only', 'aired', 'first', 'episode', 'season', 'Typically', 'ABC', 'would', 'broadcast', 'shortened', 'version', 'Personally', 'liked', 'having', 'extended', 'version', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'ever', 'seeing', 'season', 'did', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'remember', 'However', 'did', 'think', 'should', ""'ve"", 'had', 'shortened', 'version', 'first', 'episode', 'just', 'was', 'afterall', 'what', 'was', 'always', 'broadcasted', 'would', 'just', 'like', 'see', 'what', 'used', 'see', 'time', 'would', 'click', 'channel', 'watch', 'Full', 'House.As', 'DVD', 'are', 'four', 'discs', 'nice', 'however', 'case', 'are', 'not', 'best', 'case', 'set', 'up', 'discs', 'overlap', 'other', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'stay', 'place', 'it.Overall', 'think', 'great', 'DVD', 'set', 'Full', 'House', 'fan', ""'re"", 'not', 'fan', 'Full', 'House', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'as', 'simple', 'that.As', 'love', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'second', 'season']",N/A

As the sports anchor for a local network (at least in this season), Tanner would not possibly be able to raise his those daughters alone. He has reasoned that three parents will be better than one.Because they are three men taking care of three girls in an ornate San Francisco Victorian, the sexual innuendo is supposed to hook family members of all ages into watching what would have been a quickly canceled youth show. The critical plot twist is that these men are all heterosexual.Eldest child DJ (Candace Cameron) is named Donna Jo after her late mother, although nobody calls her Donna Jo during the series run. She contends with a perpetually nosy younger sister named Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin) who cannot seem to stop reading her diary and listening in on telephone conversations. There is also a baby sister named Michelle (Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen) who thankfully does not have many lines this season.DJ has an Eddie Haskell-like best friend named Kimmie Gibbler (Andrea Barber) whom she loves despite atrociously smelling feet which inevitably become the punch line to many jokes in both this and subsequent seasons. In retrospect, Kimmie has the coolest clothes out of the young female cast, she is dressed sort of punkish/new wave as if to co notate that she is both excitement and trouble rolled into one package. DJ and Stephanie (who share a room at this point) are supposed to look like the girls next door by contrast.Considering their mom died, DJ and Stephanie (who are both old enough to understand the grieving process) handle themselves very well during this season. We don't see them acting up/out during this season (presumably when they would need to be working through their lingering issues with mom). They have instead accepted the fact that their mom is gone-and will not be coming back. Even Michelle exhibits herself eerily perfect for being a little kid. Yes, we watched this series when we were little, but revisiting it now allows us to see that it was not the masterpiece we had presumed.Cameron, the sister of ""Growing Pains"" heartthrob Kirk Cameron was clearly supposed to be the breakout `youth star' of this series because a lot of first season episodes focus on DJ Tanner. John Stamos (who had a previous background in soaps such as General Hospital) was obviously supposed to be the `grown up' breakout star for `Full House' as Jessie Katsopolis, the brother of the deceased. There are many episodes in the first season which revolve around one or both of these two people.Since Pam Tanner (nee Cochran) was supposed to have been Greek, I am however curious why the Tanner girls all looked like California sun-kissed blondes. A basic genetics lesson says that they should have at least looked a little Mediterranean, especially since Bob Saget is also obviously not a blonde, and his daughters somehow are. Ironically the only blonde adult, Joey Gladstone (Dave Coulier) is not even a blood relative, he is just a friend who moved in.Notable episodes this season include ""Our first show"" which explains how the guys come to live together (and lists Jesse's last name as Cochran instead of Katsopolis); To make room for Uncles Jessie and Joey,  DJ must share a room with her younger sister Stephanie---but protests by temporarily moving into the garage. In ""Our very first night"" Jessie learns the hard way that rehearsal with his band, the Rippers, and babysitting the girls ultimately does not work. In ""The First day of school"" we meet Kimmy Gibbler for the very first time. Finally, Candace Cameron's older brother Kirk guest stars as cousin Steve in ""One of the Guys"" while ironically his future wife Chelsea Noble guest stared in the immediately following episode ""The seven month itch"" as Jesse's girlfriend.There is nothing particularly objectionable in the series itself, the Olsen twins most abhorrent work comes from their various side projects. However if this series hadn't helped launch ABC's hugely successful Friday night ""TGIF"" lineup during the 1980's, then the world  might have now been able to live Olsen free.

Regardless if you love it or hate it, you know Full House is a classic. I absolutely love Full House because as the years go on the sitcoms get worse. Full House was around when the good wholesome family sitcoms of Home Improvement, Boy Meets World, and Step By Step were on, truly an era of great sitcoms. I will admit that most of the instances on these shows are ""cliche"" but hey, why do we have to live in a world where everything doesn't work out?Full House is great for those who did not grow up with it being on TGIF every Friday night. It gives so many kids a more positive outlook on life which society really needs. Although you can find Full House on Nick at Nite and ABC Family you cannot get each episode in order to view whenever you'd like without this DVD set.The set includes a never before seen pilot which is amazing to see how different the show would have turned out if Bob Saget hadn't be Danny Tanner.

871479,A1QRSNEOOZTFGR,B0006N2F0E,"sethn172 ""DVD Fan""","[5, 8]","Here we go. This review is over one of the greatest, long-running family shows ever made, ""Full House."" It ran from September 1987 to May 1995 (it ended a decade ago last month!). From my point of view, it started when I was a baby in Florida, ran through my childhood life in Washington, and ended when I moved to Texas! Seriously, that's a LOOOOOOOOOONG series!My family loves the many sitcoms of Miller and Boyett from the late 80s all through the 90s. When Warner Bros. started releasing the Lorimar shows last year (a couple being ""The Waltons"" and ""Dallas""), I would have known that at least one of the Miller-Boyett shows would have been next. And I was right! I first found out the news of this DVD set on TVShowsOnDVD.com back in November of last year. I was excited, as at the time, we started watching the reruns of this show again on Nick-at-Nite and ABC Family. (Heh, two networks rerunning the series at the same time!) But this DVD is different...Included on this 4-disc set (it was going to be two DVD-18s [2-sided DVDs with dual layers on each side], but was changed to four DVD-9s [one-sided DVDs with dual layers]; too bad, I thought the 2-sided DVDs were awesome) are 23 episodes; one of them being the lost pilot (which is basically the same as the real pilot, but with John Posey taking Bob Saget's place of Danny Tanner, and a few things added as well), and the rest being all 22 episodes from year one, as seen on ABC from September 1987 to May 1988. The theme song is longer, and scenes that were removed on syndie versions are intact on these episodes. Guess which versions I will watch from this point forward?The sypnosis: Set in San Francisco, sportscaster Danny Tanner, whose wife had died from a drunk driver, runs a family consisting of D.J., Stephanie, and baby Michelle. He calls for help from Jesse Cochran (later changed to Katsopolis to reflect his Greek culture) and Joey Gladstone, who move in to his house. Don't forget, this show launched billionaire twins Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen's successful acting careers.In addition to these 22 episodes, bonus features include the lost pilot, as mentioned, plus audio commentaries by Jeff Franklin on episodes 1 and 21, and a fast-fact subtitle sequence on ""The Miracle of Thanksgiving"" (I wonder why that episode was chosen for these facts; I was hoping there would be like goofs from that episode or something. But the facts of all the actors/actresses were good; for example, I didn't know the actress who played D.J. was married to a Dallas Stars hockey player!). The audio is Dolby Digital English Mono, and the subtitles are in English, French, and Spanish (WB's usual American/Canadian foreign language selection on TV DVD fare). The picture quality is good; the title at the beginning of each episode stood out perfectly, and the sound is good as well unlike the last poster - no tape hiss like on TV, and we don't have a home theater system yet - it's the TV speakers or my headphones.Lastly, I want to mention that, like Paramount retaining the ""Closet Killer"" logo on ""The Brady Bunch"" Season 1 DVDs, WB retained the scary ""Lorimar-Telepictures"" comets and fireworks logo on all episodes! No voiceovers like on syndie prints! (The variant on episode 11, ""The Big Three-O"" is the scariest, as the last half of it is muted out over the space background, the logos shining, and that scary font...EEK!)I had given this out as a gift on Mother's Day, and she liked it! Now the whole family can watch these episodes in their original form anytime we want! Come on, WB, release Season 2 this fall! (And other branches of WB around the world, release this in other regions as well, just like ""Fresh Prince of Bel Air!"")",5,Miller-Boyett's shows are now on DVD!,1118361600,"06 10, 2005",2005,3705,"['Here', 'go', 'review', 'one', 'greatest', 'long-running', 'family', 'shows', 'ever', 'made', 'Full', 'House', 'ran', 'September', '1987', 'May', '1995', 'ended', 'decade', 'ago', 'last', 'month', 'point', 'view', 'started', 'when', 'was', 'baby', 'Florida', 'ran', 'childhood', 'life', 'Washington', 'ended', 'when', 'moved', 'Texas', 'Seriously', 'LOOOOOOOOOONG', 'series', 'My', 'family', 'many', 'sitcoms', 'Miller', 'Boyett', 'late', '80s', '90s', 'When', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'started', 'releasing', 'Lorimar', 'shows', 'last', 'year', 'couple', 'being', 'Waltons', 'Dallas', 'would', 'have', 'known', 'least', 'one', 'Miller-Boyett', 'shows', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'next', 'was', 'right', 'first', 'found', 'news', 'DVD', 'set', 'TVShowsOnDVD.com', 'back', 'November', 'last', 'year', 'was', 'excited', 'time', 'started', 'watching', 'reruns', 'show', 'again', 'Nick-at-Nite', 'ABC', 'Family', 'Heh', 'two', 'networks', 'rerunning', 'series', 'same', 'time', 'DVD', 'different', 'Included', '4-disc', 'set', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'two', 'DVD-18s', '[', '2-sided', 'DVDs', 'dual', 'layers', 'side', ']', 'was', 'changed', 'four', 'DVD-9s', '[', 'one-sided', 'DVDs', 'dual', 'layers', ']', 'too', 'bad', 'thought', '2-sided', 'DVDs', 'were', 'awesome', 'are', '23', 'episodes', 'one', 'being', 'lost', 'pilot', 'basically', 'same', 'real', 'pilot', 'John', 'Posey', 'taking', 'Bob', 'Saget', 'place', 'Danny', 'Tanner', 'few', 'things', 'added', 'as', 'well', 'rest', 'being', '22', 'episodes', 'year', 'one', 'seen', 'ABC', 'September', '1987', 'May', '1988', 'theme', 'song', 'longer', 'scenes', 'were', 'removed', 'syndie', 'versions', 'are', 'intact', 'episodes', 'Guess', 'versions', 'will', 'watch', 'point', 'forward', 'sypnosis', 'Set', 'San', 'Francisco', 'sportscaster', 'Danny', 'Tanner', 'wife', 'had', 'died', 'drunk', 'driver', 'family', 'consisting', 'D.J.', 'Stephanie', 'baby', 'Michelle', 'help', 'Jesse', 'Cochran', 'later', 'changed', 'Katsopolis', 'reflect', 'Greek', 'culture', 'Joey', 'Gladstone', 'who', 'move', 'house', 'Do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'show', 'launched', 'billionaire', 'twins', 'Mary', 'Kate', 'Ashley', 'Olsen', 'successful', 'acting', 'careers.In', 'addition', '22', 'episodes', 'bonus', 'features', 'include', 'lost', 'pilot', 'mentioned', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'Jeff', 'Franklin', 'episodes', '1', '21', 'fast-fact', 'subtitle', 'sequence', 'Miracle', 'Thanksgiving', 'wonder', 'why', 'episode', 'was', 'chosen', 'facts', 'was', 'hoping', 'there', 'would', 'be', 'goofs', 'episode', 'something', 'facts', 'actors/actresses', 'were', 'good', 'example', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'actress', 'who', 'played', 'D.J', 'was', 'married', 'Dallas', 'Stars', 'hockey', 'player', 'audio', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'English', 'Mono', 'subtitles', 'are', 'English', 'French', 'Spanish', 'WB', 'usual', 'American/Canadian', 'foreign', 'language', 'selection', 'TV', 'DVD', 'fare', 'picture', 'quality', 'good', 'title', 'beginning', 'episode', 'stood', 'out', 'perfectly', 'sound', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'last', 'poster', 'tape', 'TV', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'home', 'theater', 'system', 'yet', 'TV', 'speakers', 'headphones.Lastly', 'want', 'mention', 'Paramount', 'retaining', 'Closet', 'Killer', 'logo', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'Season', '1', 'DVDs', 'WB', 'retained', 'scary', 'Lorimar-Telepictures', 'comets', 'fireworks', 'logo', 'episodes', 'voiceovers', 'syndie', 'prints', 'variant', 'episode', '11', 'Big', 'Three-O', 'scariest', 'last', 'half', 'muted', 'out', 'space', 'background', 'logos', 'shining', 'scary', 'font', 'EEK', 'had', 'given', 'out', 'gift', 'Mother', 'Day', 'liked', 'Now', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'watch', 'episodes', 'original', 'form', 'anytime', 'want', 'Come', 'WB', 'release', 'Season', '2', 'fall', 'other', 'branches', 'WB', 'world', 'release', 'other', 'regions', 'well', 'just', 'Fresh', 'Prince', 'Bel', 'Air']",N/A

All I can say is Wow; how different from watching them in syndication on T.V.! I have seen all of the episodes many times on the multiple channels that it is shown on.  I knew there were parts cut out, because I remembered some of the episodes from when they were ""first-run"" on ABC, but I really didn't realize how MANY lines of dialogue got cut until I watched the DVDS. It seems almost like watching a different show; some of the scenes certainly make more sense and flow more easily, anyway!  If you have read any of my reviews on seasons 3-6 on the ""Little House"" DVDS, you will know my feelings about cut-up, choppy shows being put on DVD now!

I know some people poke fun at the show as being lame, but I do NOT agree at all.  I do not watch full house for drama, action or crime solving entertainment.  I watch full house because for 23 minutes I am entertained in a fun and wholesome atmosphere where I can be a child again at heart !! Are the jokes silly and childlike at times - of course - 3 of the main actors are children !!This show is a family show, one that can be watched with children, something we see VERY little on prime time anymore.  It's great to see Full House on DVD, it's a great alternative to night time viewing for younger ones.That said, I am 28 years old and grew up watching full house, I think the shows remain endearing and heartwarming thru time. They hold up through the years. Parents you can enjoy watching along with your kids!EXTRAS in this BOX SET --Commentary TracksCreator/executive producer/writer Jeff Franklin provides commentary on two episodes, ""Our Very First Show"" and ""Mad Money."" These are both interesting tracks, though he repeats himself in the ""Mad Money"" commentary.Original Unaired Pilot (26:55)Wow, another version of Danny Tanner!

But then, we aren't the kind of people who find happiness and enjoyment in watching people create conflict, call names, find ways to cause pain and behave in other unhealthy and unproductive behaviors. This show is about ordinary people living normal lives in an unusual circumstance. There is something for the adults, the teen, the elementary aged child. There isn't great literature involved, there's nothing extraordinarily ground breaking, it's just nice, safe entertainment that can, at times, be used to help a family member deal with something that is going on in our nice, boring, normal lives.If you don't enjoy Full House, don't buy it. Simple as that. But if you do like it, it's a fun dvd set.
