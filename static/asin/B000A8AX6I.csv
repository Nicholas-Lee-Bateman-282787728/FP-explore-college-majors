923821,A2GF53PVZRJJR,B000A8AX6I,"I. Alde ""BerkingKid""","[113, 114]","This box is marked ""Collector's Edition,""  and the description the box says ""fully restored and enhanced digital masters.""  What a crock!This version is an insult both to Cary Grant and his fans.  The only thing worth keeping is the picture of Cary Grant on the front of the box.  The quality of the movies is atrocious.  Not only do they look worse than anything I have ever seen on something taped from television on an inferior VHS recorder, but the picture is cropped on the sides.  It is a real thrill to see the cast listings starting with ""ary Grant,"" followed by ""ss ???'s wardrobe . . .""If anyone at Amazon reads this, I would suggest that they stop offering this item.  It can only hurt their reputation.",1,Cary would turn over in his Grave,1348531200,"09 25, 2012",2012,714,"['box', 'marked', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'description', 'box', 'fully', 'restored', 'enhanced', 'digital', 'masters', 'What', 'crock', 'version', 'insult', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'fans', 'only', 'thing', 'worth', 'keeping', 'picture', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'front', 'box', 'quality', 'movies', 'atrocious', 'Not', 'only', 'do', 'look', 'worse', 'anything', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'something', 'taped', 'television', 'inferior', 'VHS', 'recorder', 'picture', 'cropped', 'sides', 'real', 'thrill', 'see', 'cast', 'listings', 'starting', 'ary', 'Grant', 'followed', 'ss', 'wardrobe', 'anyone', 'Amazon', 'would', 'suggest', 'stop', 'offering', 'item', 'can', 'only', 'hurt', 'reputation']",Cary Grant
923822,A14MVK7WHY64GB,B000A8AX6I,Judy Williams,"[0, 0]",Great collection of movies. I remember watching these with my parents when they came out on TV.  It's been long awhile since I've seen Penny Serenade and the Great Amazing Adventure and forgot how good they were. Charade was just as suspenseful and thrilling as if seeing it for the first time and His Girl Friday just as fun and laugh filled from beginning to end. Thumbs up to Cary Grant and these four movies.,5,"Cary Grant's Collection: Penny Serenade, Charade, His Girl Friday and Great Amazing Adventure",1382140800,"10 19, 2013",2013,412,"['Great', 'collection', 'movies', 'remember', 'watching', 'parents', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'TV', 'been', 'long', 'awhile', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Penny', 'Serenade', 'Great', 'Amazing', 'Adventure', 'forgot', 'how', 'good', 'were', 'Charade', 'was', 'just', 'suspenseful', 'thrilling', 'seeing', 'first', 'time', 'Girl', 'Friday', 'just', 'fun', 'laugh', 'filled', 'beginning', 'end', 'Thumbs', 'up', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'four', 'movies']",Cary Grant
