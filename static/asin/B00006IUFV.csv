716911,ASH7A7HJQ4DTU,B00006IUFV,Andre,"[3, 5]","If you're expecting a direct-to-video horror romp you will not be disappointed.  This is possibly the best instalment since the original ""Wishmaster"".The movie's premise is as simple as it comes, with the beautiful Lisa getting a gift from personal-injuries lawyer Verdel who is defending her disabled husband Sam against a large corporation.  The gift, of course, contains the Djinn's red ruby; the lead Djinn guy (Novak) manages to steal Verdel's face and begin a tirade of wish-manipulating terror on the denizens of Lisa's town.The personal problems of the characters seem forced, and Sam's behaviour against Lisa never seems to register as something any man would do.  And once Lisa's wish regarding Sam's condition is granted neither the husband nor the wife seem particularly amazed.The gore is good, while amateurish.  The big boss's self-mangling while signing the document is wonderful but very poorly executed visually, and several other wishes and deaths seem rushed and pointless.  And most baffling is the introduction of The Guardian whose presence seems so unbelievably pointless it is cringe-worthy.(Nudity/sex hounds will not be disappointed, as the beautiful Tara Spencer-Nairn [the character of Lisa] disrobes on two separate occasions.)What are the positives?  The movie keeps a quick pace, and while the deaths are fake they aren't without their certain charm.  The credit goes mostly to Spencer-Nairn who injects a certain whimsy and easy into her performance that makes watching her silly Djinn problems worthwhile.  The actors take their roles seriously enough that the whole thing seems believable.While wholly silly (and that has been obvious from the whole series), ""Wishmaster 4"" is a very enjoyable and fluffy piece of entertainment.  Rent only if you're a ""Wishmaster"" fan, not if you are looking for hardcore and riveting viewing.",3,Silly Installment is More of What You'll Expect,1040601600,"12 23, 2002",2002,1862,"[""'re"", 'expecting', 'direct-to-video', 'horror', 'romp', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'possibly', 'best', 'instalment', 'original', 'Wishmaster', '.The', 'movie', 'premise', 'as', 'simple', 'beautiful', 'Lisa', 'getting', 'gift', 'personal-injuries', 'lawyer', 'Verdel', 'who', 'defending', 'disabled', 'husband', 'Sam', 'large', 'corporation', 'gift', 'course', 'Djinn', 'red', 'ruby', 'lead', 'Djinn', 'guy', 'Novak', 'steal', 'Verdel', 'face', 'begin', 'tirade', 'wish-manipulating', 'terror', 'denizens', 'Lisa', 'town.The', 'personal', 'problems', 'characters', 'seem', 'forced', 'Sam', 'behaviour', 'Lisa', 'never', 'register', 'something', 'man', 'would', 'do', 'once', 'Lisa', 'wish', 'regarding', 'Sam', 'condition', 'granted', 'husband', 'wife', 'seem', 'particularly', 'amazed.The', 'gore', 'good', 'amateurish', 'big', 'boss', 'self-mangling', 'signing', 'document', 'wonderful', 'very', 'poorly', 'executed', 'visually', 'several', 'other', 'wishes', 'deaths', 'seem', 'rushed', 'pointless', 'most', 'baffling', 'introduction', 'Guardian', 'presence', 'so', 'unbelievably', 'pointless', 'cringe-worthy', 'Nudity/sex', 'hounds', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'beautiful', 'Tara', 'Spencer-Nairn', '[', 'character', 'Lisa', ']', 'two', 'separate', 'occasions', 'What', 'are', 'positives', 'movie', 'quick', 'pace', 'deaths', 'are', 'fake', 'are', ""n't"", 'certain', 'charm', 'credit', 'mostly', 'Spencer-Nairn', 'who', 'certain', 'whimsy', 'easy', 'performance', 'watching', 'silly', 'Djinn', 'problems', 'worthwhile', 'actors', 'take', 'roles', 'seriously', 'enough', 'whole', 'thing', 'believable.While', 'wholly', 'silly', 'been', 'obvious', 'whole', 'series', 'Wishmaster', '4', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'fluffy', 'piece', 'entertainment', 'Rent', 'only', ""'re"", 'Wishmaster', 'fan', 'not', 'are', 'looking', 'hardcore', 'riveting', 'viewing']",N/A

I got this movie before the third, so I watched it right away. The speical effects are good, gore is decent but still good, but the story sucks. It kind of reminded me of Highlander with the sword fighting and then giving the Djinn humour wasnt a good idea. Still enjoyable to watch. The speical features are pretty cool on the dvd. The even have a Q and A with the Djinn about dating. Yea, I dont know what to say about it. I highly enjoy the Wishmaster series. I wonder why it never caught on with an audience.

716917,A8O6ESDD4EC0O,B00006IUFV,"Jacob Cherian ""movie lover""","[0, 0]","Wishmaster 4: The prophecy fulfilled is a wonderfull and very entertaining horror film that captures your interest and imagination from beginning to end. Wishmaster 4 is better than the original wishmaster(1997) ,wishmmaster 2 ;evil never dies(1999) and wishmaster 3 :beyond the gates of hell(2001). Wishmaster 4 is a very fun movie with a good storyline, special effects and music and combines horror with romance ,otherworldly beings and fantasy. The djinn kills a lawyer named steven verdel(Michael trucco)and assumes his identity to grant 3 wishes to a woman named lisa(tara spencer nairn) who awakened him from his prison in a magical red gem. The first wish is to win a $10 million dollar motor cycle accident settlement for her boy friend sam(Jason Thompson) who was injured in a motorcycle accident and is paralyzed and is in a wheel chair. The second wish is to supernaturally or divinely or demonically heal sam and make him walk again. The third wish is if lisa could love the wishmaster for who he really is the evil hideous djinn.  On the granting of the 3rd wish the portal or dimension to the gates of hell are opened and His demonic brethren are released to cause Armageddon and Hell on earth. The scene when the statue of the giant warrior angel with wings comes to life and He is a giant angel with a very big sharp sword named the Hunter(victor Webster) who fights the demonic wishmaster(john novak) is exciting.

716918,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,B00006IUFV,Jeffrey Leach,"[1, 2]","We have had, by turns, hockey masked killers, Halloween masked killers, a demon from the underworld with nails in his head, a guy in a tacky sweater with razor blade claws on his hands, and a malevolent Leprechaun gracing the big and little screens. Well, someone in Hollywood thought, why don't we make a bunch of movies about an evil genie? We'll get some guy to wear a whole body latex suit, complete with horns, and throw him in front of a camera. Then we'll get a bunch of stars who will work for nothing to serve as cannon fodder, throw a script together, and watch the money roll in. The idea that eventually led to the &quot;Wishmaster&quot; films probably came about in a way similar to this description. And that's acceptable. There are plenty of us who will shell out bucks to rent or buy a movie about an evil genie trying to trick people into asking for three wishes so he can take over the world. I'd like to start out by reviewing the first &quot;Wishmaster&quot; and then move through the list to the fourth installment, but I haven't watched the first two. Sorry about that. I'll get around to those movies eventually. Actually, coming into the series half way through can be a good thing; I don't have any prior expectations to compare the last two films against.&quot;Wishmaster 4&quot; is inferior to its immediate predecessor even though Chris Angel directed both parts three and four. On this outing the evil djinn (genie), once again played by John Novak, continues his mission to bring about the end of the world. A young woman named Lisa (Tara Spencer-Nairn) and her main man Sam (John Thompson) seem to live the perfect life. They just bought a house, got married, and look forward to days of tranquil bliss. Regrettably, a motorcycle accident leaves Sam in a wheelchair, and as the story picks up a few years after the tragedy it is obvious serious tensions are undermining the relationship. Sam, frustrated that he can't take care of his wife, vents his anger on her whenever he isn't sitting listlessly in front of his computer. Lisa, for her part, works with attorney Stephen Verdel (Michael Trucco) to win a lucrative settlement from the crash. Sam's wife is an attractive woman, however, and Verdel falls in love with her. The attorney is a professional, so he tries to keep his feelings in check while grinding on with his lawsuit. In an attempt to covertly convey his feelings to Lisa, he buys her a little trinket as a token of his affections.The box in question contains the crystal housing the evil genie, which Lisa inadvertently liberates. Just as in the third installment, the waker of the genie (Lisa) is not the first to feel the wrath of the creature. That burden falls squarely on the shoulders of the hapless Verdel. Again, as in the third installment, the genie assumes a human form-in this case, Stephen-and then goes on a quest to find Lisa. He needs her to make three wishes so he can free his compatriots from Hell, thus ushering in anarchy, chaos, and higher gas prices. And what do you know? The djinn actually gets Lisa to make three wishes. Of course, the last wish turns out to be one not easily fulfilled, so the djinn stalls for time to make it a reality. While three of his pals pop up from time to time demanding he fulfill the request so the djinn race can finally rampage on earth, our genie in the interim does have a bit of fun with other humans who make wishes. Check out the pimple wish and Lisa's business partner's wish to see the horrific effects of dealing with the genie. Oh, I almost forgot-there's also some chap called the Hunter (Victor Webster) running around trying to dispose of the genie and Lisa.&quot;Wishmaster 4&quot; could have been a better movie. The low budget shows in the make up and gore effects, neither of which are as good as the stuff we saw in the third episode. As for the acting, well, you don't want to go down that road. With the exception of lead Tara Spencer-Nairn, the cast mostly falls flat on its face. Especially the guy who plays the Hunter; he's on par with the cheesy Archangel Michael from the third film. Director Chris Angel seems to sense the cast is a weakness, so he punches up the film with a few racy scenes in an effort to draw attention away from the pedestrian acting. The effort fails. The pacing of this film fails, too, as it doesn't move nearly as fast as &quot;Wishmaster 3.&quot; Another problem hampering the success here is the lack of interesting wishes. No broken hearts or rapid weight loss emerges to ramp up the gore. There's a fistfight between the genie and a bouncer at a bar that is moderately interesting, but certain other elements achieve such a high level of hokeyness that it ruins the overall impact.  The showdowns between the Hunter and the djinn aren't exciting, either. Yep, &quot;Wishmaster 4&quot; could have succeeded if only a few things worked better.Extras on the disc include a couple of commentary tracks with Chris Angel, John Novak, Michael Trucco, and John Thompson. A few trailers grace the DVD, along with storyboards, a cheesy extra about the Djinn's guide to dating, and an even cheesier &quot;Wishmasterpiece Theater.&quot; It doesn't look like further installments in the &quot;Wishmaster&quot; franchise are in the works, so perhaps we've seen the end of these films. Horror fans will probably want to give this one a rent if for no other reason than to complete the series. As for me, I need to go back and watch the first and second episodes.",2,Wishmaster 4: The Promise Unfulfilled,1086566400,"06 7, 2004",2004,5507,"['have', 'had', 'turns', 'hockey', 'masked',

716920,ABQUJ3Z6EP5GN,B00006IUFV,John's Horror Corner,"[0, 0]","Director Chris Angel (Wishmaster 3: Beyond the Gates of Hell) returns to bring us the dreaded fourth installment in this series.  Some may be shocked that he'd be asked back after seeing part 3.  But, much like the Matrix sequels, parts 3 and 4 were filmed back to back with hardly a weekend's break in between.  So don't be surprised that the make-up for the Djinn looks exactly the same since, well&#8230;it is.Lisa (Tara Spencer-Nairn) is in the middle of a pretty rough patch with her boyfriend, who suffered a crippling motorcycle accident.  As with the previous installments she somehow randomly encounters the Djinn's ruby prison, rubs it (really just touches it) and releases the Djinn (unbeknownst to her).  Magically disguised as Lisa's lawyer, our genie tricks Lisa into making her first two wishes, which include a healthy legal settlement and her husband's ability to walk again.If Lisa makes her third wish then all Djinn--oh, yeah, Hell is just brimming with their kind--will be freed and they'll create Hell on Earth.  At this point it should be easy for the Djinn to fool her into making some whimsical wish.  No clue why he doesn't&#8230;she still has no idea that he's actually an evil genie.  But wait, there's a weird twist.  When Lisa wishes something the Djinn can't grant himself, he most dote on her emotions to make her love him&#8230;in order to open the gates of Hell&#8230;romantic, huh?  That's right!  Djinn's can't just make someone fall in love with someone else.  Evidently the Disney Aladdin genie followed the same rules.The execution of the gore is iffy at times.  But there are some satisfyingly gross moments like the &#34;face peel&#34; scene typical of the franchise and some genie-wish-induced self-mutilation.  We also get to see other Djinn, which was neat I guess.Overall&#8230;meh.  I wouldn't recommend this.Don't get mad at me for saying this, but isn't the Wishmaster franchise about due for a serious remake/reboot?

This is one of the few times I actually felt as though I would be justified in taking it back to the store and requesting a refund.I didn't expect much. All I ask for a Wishmaster movie is there be at least one cool scene, slightly inventive, of a character foolishly making a wish and the Djinn taking some little loophole in their wish and exploiting it in a gruesome fashion. That's all. All hell breaking loose during the finale (as with the first one) would be nice too. No. This movie did have a few gore scenes--trust me they are NOT worth it. They're stuck in with no suspense or buildup, so they aren't even remotely scary, just sort of boring andinappropriate. Not disturbing, just slightly gross.This movie is like Wishmaster-The Red Shoe Diaries. I do not mean this in a positive way. I felt embarrassed for the actors. OK, I could MAYBE see the Djinn wanting to get laid, but falling in love???? Why? And what would happen if he did get together with the woman? Hell would be unleashed? No, not really. He doesn't even want her for reproduction, I guess he just got bored, lonely, or lost his mind.The first half hour was tolerable, the second downhill, and the third painful and embarrassing. I actually winced I was so embarrassed to be watching it. The plot is terrible; we don't even know who we should be rooting for, and I don't think this was intentional. Worst --well, actually the worst part is a toss-up of several elements, I take it back-- is the introduction of some halfassed attempt at Djinn mythology, with some ""Hunter"" appearing with a mission to kill the woman the Djinn wants, something like a rejected Angel plot arc, and that's being insulting to Joss Whedon. If I want to see demon sword fights I'll watch Buffy, thanks.There was not even one mildly scary moment or even a hint of one in the movie. I kept watching out of a sort of horrified amazement at how much worse and bizarre the movie got as it went along. But it wasn't entertaining.

Thus 'Wishmaster 1' was novel and interesting, then the producers added some sex and more special effects and created 'Wishmaster 2,'etc., etc.  Of course, each step of the way, the plot becomes a bit more repetitious and diluted.  I picked up 'Wishmaster 4 - The Prophecy Fulfilled' more out of curiosity than from any hope of seeing a blockbuster horror film.  And for the first 30 minutes I got exactly what I expected, same old, same old....Lisa (Tara Spencer-Nairn) is the attractive operator of a lingerie shop whose marriage is about to self-destruct.  Her husband Sam (Jason Thompson) is deeply embittered by a motorcycle accident that took away his ability to walk or take an active role in the marriage.  Worse, the couple has been completely frustrated in their attempts to achieve a financial settlement.  Their lawyer, Verdel (Michael Trucco), has been working at no charge, or they would have had to give up long ago.  Verdel, however, has a strong yen for Lisa.  When a broken present reveals the jewel of the Djinn, the formula is complete.In no time at all the Djinn (John Nowak) permanently borrows Verdel's face, and sets about granting Lisa's wishes.  For those of you who are newcomers, fulfilling the third wish will free all the Djinn from their imprisonment and let them take over the earth.  Much to my surprise, only a third of the film was gone when the old standard plot was exhausted and the I suddenly realized that I was on the verge of finding out what happens when the lady actually makes the wish number three.Not satisfied with just one new plot twist, Director Chris Angel pulls a few more out of his hat to rescue a film that initially seemed utterly unremarkable.  Not that this would ever set any box office records, but it has its moments.  And excitement junkies will be glad to know that it earns its R rating.  After four times at bat, actor John Novak has his part down pat, and the others are competent if uninspired.

Hello all, it's your B loving friend Sid here to ram you with yet another review. Don't want another review? Well we're not used to that but that's fine, you're getting one anyway. Being huge fans of the B horror the 90's had to offer we obviously were impressed with the 1997 release of Wishmaster. It was right on par with the low budget goodness we've come to love and require as a weekly occurrence. Like most movies they just don't know when to quit, hence the fourth installment. However in the films defense it was not nearly as bad as some think. If you look at the movie as it's own entity you will not be disappointed. Sure it's nowhere near as good as the original...but get over it. It's B plain and simple. You have to go into it looking for laughs to find the real beauty behind the movie.In our fourth and final installment the wishmaster is unleashed by a big shot lawyer and one of his clients named Lisa. Lisa's boyfriend Sam has been handicapped due to an accident and they're going for the big bucks in a lawsuit. See Sam and Lisa used to be real sex maniacs and have been adversely affected from the accident. Since Sam has lost the use of his mandelbaum he has no will to live. Even when the wishmaster scores them 10 mil, he still acts like a little Mary. Sure we can sympathize with the man, Sid wouldn't know what to do if his mojo was out of commission. But this guys just too much. All he does is obsess over the thought his old lady is going downtown with the lawyer. So naturally the wishmaster kills the lawyer, takes over his body, and winds up tormenting the couple by seducing Lisa and mind whiching Sam left and right. A lot of other stuff happens but it'd take way too long to explain.Wishmaster IV had all the key elements to a solid B horror performance. It was a noce touch that they attempted to sprinkle in a little Wishmaster romance throughout the film. They do this by making the Wishmaster fall in love with Lisa while ""can I borrow a feeling"" plays in the background. It doesn't work on any level, but was certainly entertaining. In all honestly you really pull for Wishmaster throughout the movie since that Sam guy is such a toolbox. You actually want him to score with Lisa so you can say ""shut up dumba** you didn't score, I scored with both of them."" Not to mention numerous rack shots by Lisa which were top notch. That always slaps a couple extra cans to the scoreboard. Look at the scoreboard, it's chaos! So for the enjoyers of B out in the world we could easily recommend Wishmaster 4. It's not mind blowing but is absolutely worth the watch.",4,"Master of the house, keeper of the inn",1306972800,"06 2, 2011",2011,2675,"[""'re"", 'not', 'walking', 'down', 'street', 'daughter', 'looking', 'Hello', 'B', 'loving', 'friend', 'Sid', 'here', 'ram', 'yet', 'review', 'Do', ""n't"", 'want', 'review', 'Well', ""'re"", 'not', 'used', 'fine', ""'re"", 'getting', 'one', 'anyway', 'Being', 'huge', 'fans', 'B', 'horror', '90', 'had', 'offer', 'obviously', 'were', 'impressed', '1997', 'release', 'Wishmaster', 'was', 'right', 'par', 'low', 'budget', 'goodness', ""'ve"", 'come', 'love', 'require', 'weekly', 'occurrence', 'most', 'movies', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'when', 'quit', 'hence', 'fourth', 'installment', 'However', 'films', 'defense', 'was', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'bad', 'think', 'look', 'movie', 'own', 'entity', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Sure', 'nowhere', 'near', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'get', 'B', 'plain', 'simple', 'have', 'go', 'looking', 'laughs', 'find', 'real', 'beauty', 'movie.In', 'fourth', 'final', 'installment', 'wishmaster', 'unleashed', 'big', 'shot', 'lawyer', 'one', 'clients', 'named', 'Lisa', 'Lisa', 'boyfriend', 'Sam', 'been', 'handicapped', 'due', 'accident', ""'re"", 'going', 'big', 'bucks', 'lawsuit', 'See', 'Sam', 'Lisa', 'used', 'be', 'real', 'sex', 'maniacs', 'have', 'been', 'adversely', 'affected', 'accident', 'Sam', 'lost', 'use', 'mandelbaum', 'will', 'live', 'Even', 'when', 'wishmaster', '10', 'mil', 'still', 'little', 'Mary', 'Sure', 'can', 'sympathize', 'man', 'Sid', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'mojo', 'was', 'commission', 'guys', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'obsess', 'thought', 'old', 'lady', 'going', 'downtown', 'lawyer', 'naturally', 'wishmaster', 'lawyer', 'body', 'up', 'tormenting', 'couple', 'seducing', 'Lisa', 'mind', 'whiching', 'Sam', 'left', 'right', 'lot', 'other', 'stuff', 'happens', ""'d"", 'take', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'explain.Wishmaster', 'IV', 'had', 'key', 'elements', 'solid', 'B', 'horror', 'performance', 'was', 'noce', 'touch', 'attempted', 'sprinkle', 'little', 'Wishmaster', 'romance', 'film', 'do', 'making', 'Wishmaster', 'fall', 'love', 'Lisa', 'can', 'borrow', 'feeling', 'plays', 'background', ""n't"", 'work', 'level', 'was', 'certainly', 'entertaining', 'honestly', 'really', 'pull', 'Wishmaster', 'movie', 'Sam', 'guy', 'such', 'toolbox', 'actually', 'want', 'score', 'Lisa', 'can', 'say', 'shut', 'up', 'dumba**', 'did', ""n't"", 'score', 'scored', 'Not', 'mention', 'numerous', 'rack', 'shots', 'Lisa', 'were', 'top', 'notch', 'always', 'couple', 'extra', 'cans', 'scoreboard', 'Look', 'scoreboard', 'chaos', 'So', 'enjoyers', 'B', 'world', 'could', 'easily', 'recommend', 'Wishmaster', '4', 'not', 'mind', 'blowing', 'absolutely', 'worth', 'watch']",N/A

716935,A2SR8CWDTIKXAT,B00006IUFV,Tell It Like It Is,"[1, 2]","This installment was a vast improvement over the third. John Novak is much better in this movie than in the last and I think he was given a better chance to shine here. He is witty and scary, which is what I say about the first Djinn, Andrew Divoff. The plot of this film is much better than the third and I also enjoyed both audio commentaries. Novak is fun and really enjoys this character.The prophecy ends up unfulfilled and if you listen to the director's commentaries, you will understand why.Now I hope that somebody someday will set to making a Wishmaster 5! Either Divoff or Novak would be fine, but the series still has lots of potential.Also, as a side note, for those who are interested, this movie is smoke free, which is a sharp contrast to the first two films. The original Wishmaster is almost excessive in that regard but the writer and director justify it in the commentary by saying ""who cares..... we're not glorifying it. Look who's smoking - a bum, a demon, and a neurotic"". Still, while the one scene of the Djinn picking up a butt (that a filthy bum just had in his mouth) is humorous and makes a point, the rest of the film would have been just fine without it. In any case, it was refreshing to see an R movie like Wishmaster 4 devoid of smoking.",4,Much better than 3 - now can we have a 5th?,1169683200,"01 25, 2007",2007,1272,"['installment', 'was', 'vast', 'improvement', 'third', 'John', 'Novak', 'much', 'better', 'movie', 'last', 'think', 'was', 'given', 'better', 'chance', 'shine', 'here', 'witty', 'scary', 'what', 'say', 'first', 'Djinn', 'Andrew', 'Divoff', 'plot', 'film', 'much', 'better', 'third', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'Novak', 'fun', 'really', 'character.The', 'prophecy', 'up', 'unfulfilled', 'listen', 'director', 'commentaries', 'will', 'understand', 'why.Now', 'hope', 'somebody', 'someday', 'will', 'set', 'making', '5', 'Divoff', 'Novak', 'would', 'be', 'fine', 'series', 'still', 'lots', 'potential.Also', 'side', 'note', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'movie', 'smoke', 'free', 'sharp', 'contrast', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'original', 'Wishmaster', 'almost', 'excessive', 'regard', 'writer', 'director', 'justify', 'commentary', 'saying', 'who', '..', ""'re"", 'not', 'glorifying', 'Look', 'who', 'smoking', 'bum', 'demon', 'neurotic', 'Still', 'one', 'scene', 'Djinn', 'picking', 'up', 'butt', 'filthy', 'bum', 'just', 'had', 'mouth', 'humorous', 'point', 'rest', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'fine', 'case', 'was', 'refreshing', 'see', 'R', 'movie', 'Wishmaster', '4', 'devoid', 'smoking']",N/A
716936,ADWD6Y3YJY47J,B00006IUFV,"Terrance Aldon Shaw ""Writer/Composer""","[1, 2]","This installment of the series introduces an interesting twist into the ""Wishmaster"" mythology. What happens when the Waker finally makes that third hell-unleashing wish, only to phrase it in such a way that the djin can't grant it himself? If he thought he and his kind were in limbo before, he's got another thing coming. In this case, he's not in love with the Waker, but he needs her to love him for what he truly is in order for the third wish to come true. Given his actual appearance, this is something of a problem. In classic literature and film, genies (Anglicazation of djin) are notorious tricksters, more malevolent than altruistic, always looking for the loopholes in their unwitting masters' hastily-worded wishes. (See, for example, Rex Ingram's giant bully of a genie in ""The Thief of Bagdad"" (1940) if for no other reason than to find out where Disney stole and ultimately watered down most of the material for ""Aladin."") I've always liked the ""Wishmaster"" series because it explores this dark side of the mythos; the bleak subtext of daydreams and fantasies suddenly rendered real, the truly terrifying consequences of getting what you thought you wanted (almost always at someone else's expense), ultimately finding yourself stuck in a living nightmare of your own making. (Believe it or not, there are moral lessons to be learned here.) And, of course, a big part of the fun of the franchise is seeing how the djin will himself be outsmarted in the end. I think ""Prophecy Fulfilled"" delivers quite well in this regard, and stands out among the later entries in the series. Taken for what it is, and in context of the other films, this rates a solid 3 stars.",3,Prophecy Fulfilled with a Fascinating Twist,1342742400,"07 20, 2012",2012,1678,"['installment', 'series', 'interesting', 'twist', 'Wishmaster', 'mythology', 'What', 'when', 'Waker', 'finally', 'third', 'hell-unleashing', 'wish', 'only', 'phrase', 'way', 'djin', 'ca', ""n't"", 'grant', 'thought', 'kind', 'were', 'limbo', 'got', 'thing', 'coming', 'case', 'not', 'love', 'Waker', 'love', 'what', 'truly', 'order', 'third', 'wish', 'come', 'true', 'Given', 'actual', 'appearance', 'something', 'problem', 'classic', 'literature', 'film', 'genies', 'Anglicazation', 'djin', 'are', 'notorious', 'tricksters', 'more', 'malevolent', 'altruistic', 'always', 'looking', 'loopholes', 'unwitting', 'masters', 'hastily-worded', 'wishes', 'See', 'example', 'Rex', 'Ingram', 'giant', 'bully', 'genie', 'Thief', 'Bagdad', '1940', 'other', 'reason', 'find', 'out', 'where', 'Disney', 'stole', 'ultimately', 'watered', 'down', 'most', 'material', 'Aladin', ""'ve"", 'always', 'liked', 'Wishmaster', 'series', 'dark', 'side', 'mythos', 'bleak', 'subtext', 'daydreams', 'fantasies', 'suddenly', 'rendered', 'real', 'truly', 'terrifying', 'consequences', 'getting', 'what', 'thought', 'wanted', 'almost', 'always', 'someone', 'else', 'expense', 'ultimately', 'finding', 'stuck', 'living', 'nightmare', 'own', 'making', 'Believe', 'not', 'are', 'moral', 'lessons', 'be', 'learned', 'here', 'course', 'big', 'part', 'fun', 'franchise', 'seeing', 'how', 'djin', 'will', 'be', 'outsmarted', 'end', 'think', 'Prophecy', 'Fulfilled', 'quite', 'well', 'regard', 'out', 'later', 'entries', 'series', 'Taken', 'what', 'context', 'other', 'films', 'rates', 'solid', '3', 'stars']",N/A
