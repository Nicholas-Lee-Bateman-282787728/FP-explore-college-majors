576411,A3VAAX926BOJC6,B00005AAA9,"Aisling D'Art ""artist and author""","[1, 1]","This movie is the chick flick equivalent of junk food. I've watched it at least five times, for so many reasons. Michael Caine's role may be at the top of the list, but seeing William Shatner turn his character into a whimsical parody... pure gold.Sandra Bullock does what she does best: Plays a convincing role as a who-cares-how-I-look FBI agent transformed into a beauty queen, with hilarious (and sometimes touching) moments when her real personality slips out.Heather Burns' role was a little flat as well, but Burns brought a lot to it and made the character charming and believable, in a sweet, ditzy way.I was less convinced by Benjamin Bratt's performance, but if you're looking for a &#34;Pride and Prejudice&#34; level romance... this isn't it. In this film, he's no Colin Firth, but that may have been a directorial choice so the focus stays on the thriller-ish aspects of the movie, and the plot developments among the beauty queens.Candice Bergen was her usual, steely-eyed, determined force to be reckoned with. The writing for her character was a little weak, but her performance was -- as usual -- meticulous and fine-tuned within an inch of perfection. She did the most she could with her fairly two-dimensional, cliche'd role.In most respects, it's a predictable movie.  Once things shift into high gear, you'll have a good idea how it's going to end.However, that's why I watch movies like this. They're like comfort food, but on the TV screen. They make me laugh, and I savor the nuances of seasoned actors like Caine and Shatner.The plot is also a gem for anyone studying story structure. Basically, if you're an aspiring author who wants to understand what a First Plot Point is -- the moment that's the first, big &#34;game changer&#34; in the plot -- it's right there on the screen. Literally. Ditto most of the other key elements in &#34;hero's journey&#34; plotting and the structure Larry Brooks describes.This isn't a great thriller or romance or... well, anything except a fun, predictable, &#34;chick flick&#34; kind of movie you can watch with confidence in the &#34;happily ever after&#34; ending and justice against the villains, plus enough weak scenes that you can sit around the TV with friends, chatting and eating popcorn, and not miss any truly critical scenes.For what this movie is, and how well it delivers, it's earned five stars from me... and a permanent spot in my viewing queue.",5,"Love it, and I've watched it at least five times",1395878400,"03 27, 2014",2014,2426,"['movie', 'chick', 'flick', 'equivalent', 'junk', 'food', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'least', 'five', 'times', 'so', 'many', 'reasons', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'role', 'may', 'be', 'top', 'list', 'seeing', 'William', 'Shatner', 'turn', 'character', 'whimsical', 'parody', 'pure', 'gold.Sandra', 'Bullock', 'what', 'best', 'Plays', 'convincing', 'role', 'who-cares-how-I-look', 'FBI', 'agent', 'transformed', 'beauty', 'queen', 'hilarious', 'sometimes', 'touching', 'moments', 'when', 'real', 'personality', 'out.Heather', 'Burns', 'role', 'was', 'little', 'flat', 'well', 'Burns', 'brought', 'lot', 'made', 'character', 'charming', 'believable', 'sweet', 'ditzy', 'way.I', 'was', 'less', 'convinced', 'Benjamin', 'Bratt', 'performance', ""'re"", 'looking', '34', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', '34', 'level', 'romance', ""n't"", 'film', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'directorial', 'choice', 'focus', 'thriller-ish', 'aspects', 'movie', 'plot', 'developments', 'beauty', 'queens.Candice', 'Bergen', 'was', 'usual', 'steely-eyed', 'determined', 'force', 'be', 'reckoned', 'writing', 'character', 'was', 'little', 'weak', 'performance', 'was', 'usual', 'meticulous', 'fine-tuned', 'inch', 'perfection', 'did', 'most', 'could', 'fairly', 'two-dimensional', 'cliche', ""'d"", 'role.In', 'most', 'respects', 'predictable', 'movie', 'Once', 'things', 'shift', 'high', 'gear', ""'ll"", 'have', 'good', 'idea', 'how', 'going', 'end.However', 'why', 'watch', 'movies', ""'re"", 'comfort', 'food', 'TV', 'screen', 'make', 'savor', 'nuances', 'seasoned', 'actors', 'Caine', 'Shatner.The', 'plot', 'also', 'gem', 'anyone', 'studying', 'story', 'structure', 'Basically', ""'re"", 'aspiring', 'author', 'who', 'understand', 'what', 'First', 'Plot', 'Point', 'moment', 'first', 'big', '34', 'game', 'changer', '34', 'plot', 'right', 'there', 'screen', 'Literally', 'Ditto', 'most', 'other', 'key', 'elements', '34', 'hero', 'journey', '34', 'plotting', 'structure', 'Larry', 'Brooks', 'describes.This', ""n't"", 'great', 'thriller', 'romance', 'well', 'anything', 'fun', 'predictable', '34', 'chick', 'flick', '34', 'kind', 'movie', 'can', 'watch', 'confidence', '34', 'happily', 'ever', '34', 'ending', 'justice', 'villains', 'enough', 'weak', 'scenes', 'can', 'sit', 'TV', 'friends', 'chatting', 'eating', 'popcorn', 'not', 'miss', 'truly', 'critical', 'scenes.For', 'what', 'movie', 'how', 'well', 'earned', 'five', 'stars', 'permanent', 'spot', 'viewing', 'queue']",N/A

576416,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005AAA9,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 1]","`Miss Congeniality' is just another film in the long line of films that help further impress my utter adoration for Sandra Bullock.  In fact, she is probably my all time favorite comedic actress, and lord knows no one does a romantic comedy quite like Sandra.  `Miss Congeniality' is less a romantic comedy and more, well, a comedy.  Sure, there is that repressed sexual tension between Bullock and Bratt, and yes they do inevitably get together, but like the sequel (surprisingly hysterical as well) these are comedic films with the romanticizing a mere undertone.  The film focuses on Bullock in all her comedic glory without letting a meddlesome romantic subplot ruin a good thing.  Bullock owns this movie and it's thanks to her that the film is so enjoyable.The film follows Gracie Hart, a middle aged homely looking FBI agent, as she tries to stop a terrorist attack from happening during the Miss USA pageant.  She is beautified and entered into the contest with guarantied top ten placement.  To help her seem legit she's given an assistant, or trainer, Victor Melling, who is nothing less than displeased with her.  The heart of the film of course is about loving oneself and really learning to be the person you desire to be.  Gracie learns this full swing as she enters the pageant believing that pageants in general are pointless and that everyone involved are nothing but bimbos and leaves realizing that these girls are really good people and that there is nothing wrong with loving yourself.  In fact the pageant was the best thing that every happened to Gracie.The acting aside from Bullock is great.  Michael Caine is hysterical as Victor and quite the scene stealer.  Together Bullock and Caine are dynamic.  In fact my one main quarrel with the sequel was the fact that Caine was not in the film.  Candice Bergman is also great as the pageant spokeswoman who has outspoken distain for what Gracie's inclusion is doing to the pageant, and surprisingly William Shatner is perfectly cast.  I just abhor his `Priceline' commercials but here he is hysterical.  The pageant girls are also well cast, especially Heather Burns who plays Cheryl, the perky baton twirler from Rhode Island.  In fact the only member of the cast I was less that impressed with was Benjamin Bratt, but he's not in a whole lot of the film to his lack of magnetism is forgivable.In the end `Miss Congeniality' is a great time at the movies (or in the living room, whatever) and will surely be enjoyable for multiple viewings.  Sure, it's far from realistic, and far from perfect, but Bullock is spot on and the rest of the cast make this a worthwhile endeavor.",4,Bullock and Caine make for one heckofa comedic team...,1191196800,"10 1, 2007",2007,2647,"['Miss', 'Congeniality', 'just', 'film', 'long', 'line', 'films', 'help', 'further', 'impress', 'utter', 'adoration', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'fact', 'probably', 'time', 'favorite', 'comedic', 'actress', 'lord', 'one', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'quite', 'Sandra', 'Miss', 'Congeniality', 'less', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'more', 'well', 'comedy', 'Sure', 'repressed', 'sexual', 'tension', 'Bullock', 'Bratt', 'yes', 'do', 'inevitably', 'get', 'together', 'sequel', 'surprisingly', 'hysterical', 'well', 'are', 'comedic', 'films', 'romanticizing', 'mere', 'undertone', 'film', 'Bullock', 'comedic', 'glory', 'letting', 'meddlesome', 'romantic', 'subplot', 'ruin', 'good', 'thing', 'Bullock', 'movie', 'thanks', 'film', 'so', 'enjoyable.The', 'film', 'Gracie', 'Hart', 'middle', 'aged', 'homely', 'looking', 'FBI', 'agent', 'stop', 'terrorist', 'attack', 'happening', 'Miss', 'USA', 'pageant', 'beautified', 'entered', 'contest', 'guarantied', 'top', 'ten', 'placement', 'help', 'seem', 'given', 'assistant', 'trainer', 'Victor', 'Melling', 'who', 'nothing', 'less', 'displeased', 'heart', 'film', 'course', 'loving', 'really', 'learning', 'be', 'person', 'desire', 'be', 'Gracie', 'full', 'swing', 'pageant', 'believing', 'general', 'are', 'pointless', 'everyone', 'involved', 'are', 'nothing', 'bimbos', 'realizing', 'girls', 'are', 'really', 'good', 'people', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'loving', 'fact', 'pageant', 'was', 'best', 'thing', 'happened', 'Gracie.The', 'acting', 'aside', 'Bullock', 'great', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'hysterical', 'Victor', 'quite', 'scene', 'stealer', 'Bullock', 'Caine', 'are', 'dynamic', 'fact', 'one', 'main', 'quarrel', 'sequel', 'was', 'fact', 'Caine', 'was', 'not', 'film', 'Candice', 'Bergman', 'also', 'great', 'pageant', 'spokeswoman', 'who', 'outspoken', 'distain', 'what', 'Gracie', 'inclusion', 'doing', 'pageant', 'surprisingly', 'William', 'Shatner', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'just', 'abhor', 'Priceline', 'commercials', 'here', 'hysterical', 'pageant', 'girls', 'are', 'also', 'well', 'cast', 'especially', 'Heather', 'Burns', 'who', 'Cheryl', 'perky', 'baton', 'twirler', 'Rhode', 'Island', 'fact', 'only', 'member', 'cast', 'was', 'less', 'impressed', 'was', 'Benjamin', 'Bratt', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'film', 'lack', 'magnetism', 'end', 'Miss', 'Congeniality', 'great', 'time', 'movies', 'living', 'room', 'will', 'surely', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'Sure', 'far', 'realistic', 'far', 'perfect', 'Bullock', 'spot', 'rest', 'cast', 'make', 'worthwhile', 'endeavor']",N/A
576417,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B00005AAA9,Andy Orrock,"[1, 2]","Let's give Sandra Bullock credit where credit is due:- She's a savvy businesswoman.  Not only is she the star of 'Miss Congeniality' (and the subsequently released 'Two Weeks Notice'), she produced it as well.  Sure beats audtioning for the part.  This is a smart actress who has leveraged her box office power.  And more power to her.- She's the finest physical comedienne working in film today.  An example: her head-long dive off the stage while dressed as something resembling a milk maid (and playing a tune on water glasses, no less) is a thing of beauty.- She knows what she's good at and works the formula.  Bullock teamed for the first time with writer Marc Lawrence in 'Congeniality.'  They clicked.  The movie resonated with audiences.  Knowing a good thing when they saw it, they developed the equally funny 'Two Weeks Notice.'  Now, look for the as-yet-untitled 'Miss Congeniality' sequel in 2005.As far as the movie itself, I know from asking around that this is one of those films that was a real pleasant surprise.  It really exceeds expectations, both in terms of the quality of the comedy and the sweetness of the story.  A lot of that can be attributed to Sandy Bullock's very high likability quotient.

576420,A47OISX4AV8I,B00005AAA9,AngelosOne,"[2, 3]","Ok, first of, I can see that any female who considers herself a feminist will most likely not like this movie.  Mainly because it actually seems to make fun of the feminist ideals IMO.As a guy, I think the movie is alright.  I'm a fan of Miss Bullock, so I initially bought this dvd because it was at a discount and she was in it.  It's a chick flick, that ironically enough, might piss off some women, i.e., misguided feminists.We have a female FBI agent who's basically a tomboy, who acts like one of the guys, eats like one of the guys, swears like one of the guys, but in a surprising twist !! has no love in her life.Then comes the main plot, which is that someone is targeting the Miss America pageant, so the FBI decides to send in a ""undercover"" agent to protect the contestants.  Low and behold, the Bureau is surprised to find that Bullock is not so bad looking and doesn't have a terrible body at all.Anyway, not to spoil the entire story, we see Bullock's character transform from beast to beauty, in a rather painful process, as they show you.  I guess bikini waxes are that painful?  I also found it silly, that they started to make Agent Hart go on a diet.  I mean, she has a killer body as it is, and supposedly, from previous scenes we were led to believe she pretty much ate like a pig.  So, I don't see why all of the sudden she has to start eating celery to keep that slim body.  It's best not to ponder on illogical things.Needless to say, she does end up saving the day, and gets transformed into this beautiful agent, and wins the Miss Congeniality title, given by her peers (not the agents, but the beauty queens).Should you buy it? Sure, it's a popcorn movie that keeps you entertained.  If anything, it's fun to see Bullock in a weird german-like outfit, making music out of wine glasses. She probably can't do it in real life, but I still have always found it fascinating that it is possible to make music like that.",4,A god movie...if you aren't looking for profoundness...,1111536000,"03 23, 2005",2005,1943,"['Ok', 'first', 'can', 'see', 'female', 'who', 'feminist', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'not', 'movie', 'Mainly', 'actually', 'make', 'fun', 'feminist', 'ideals', 'IMO.As', 'guy', 'think', 'movie', 'alright', ""'m"", 'fan', 'Miss', 'Bullock', 'initially', 'bought', 'dvd', 'was', 'discount', 'was', 'chick', 'flick', 'ironically', 'enough', 'might', 'piss', 'off', 'women', 'i.e.', 'misguided', 'feminists.We', 'have', 'female', 'FBI', 'agent', 'who', 'basically', 'tomboy', 'who', 'one', 'guys', 'eats', 'one', 'guys', 'swears', 'one', 'guys', 'surprising', 'twist', 'love', 'life.Then', 'main', 'plot', 'someone', 'targeting', 'Miss', 'America', 'pageant', 'FBI', 'send', 'undercover', 'agent', 'protect', 'contestants', 'Low', 'behold', 'Bureau', 'surprised', 'find', 'Bullock', 'not', 'so', 'bad', 'looking', ""n't"", 'have', 'terrible', 'body', 'all.Anyway', 'not', 'spoil', 'entire', 'story', 'see', 'Bullock', 'character', 'transform', 'beast', 'beauty', 'rather', 'painful', 'process', 'show', 'guess', 'bikini', 'waxes', 'are', 'painful', 'also', 'found', 'silly', 'started', 'make', 'Agent', 'Hart', 'go', 'diet', 'mean', 'killer', 'body', 'supposedly', 'previous', 'scenes', 'were', 'led', 'believe', 'pretty', 'much', 'ate', 'pig', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'why', 'sudden', 'start', 'eating', 'celery', 'keep', 'slim', 'body', 'best', 'not', 'ponder', 'illogical', 'things.Needless', 'say', 'end', 'up', 'saving', 'day', 'transformed', 'beautiful', 'agent', 'Miss', 'Congeniality', 'title', 'given', 'peers', 'not', 'agents', 'beauty', 'queens', '.Should', 'buy', 'Sure', 'popcorn', 'movie', 'entertained', 'anything', 'fun', 'see', 'Bullock', 'weird', 'german-like', 'outfit', 'making', 'music', 'wine', 'glasses', 'probably', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'real', 'life', 'still', 'have', 'always', 'found', 'fascinating', 'possible', 'make', 'music']",N/A

576422,AE8RQHFMSLN0D,B00005AAA9,"Anthony Damato ""Law professor""","[1, 3]","""Miss Congeniality"" and ""Drop Dead Gorgeous,"" two of the funnier comedies of the past few seasons, are the current incarnations of an old Hollywood tradition: the show about a show.  Ever since ""Forty Second Street""--the backstage musical--Hollywood has loved to use the indirect approach to selling singing and dancing.  Instead of putting on the song and dance as part of the story, you put it on as part of the show that the characters in the story are aiming to put on.  In the 1940s this procedure was taken to an extreme in the Mickey Rooney-Judy Garland musicals, giving rise to one of Hollywood's all-time great cliches--""hey, we can raise the money by putting on our own show.  My dad's got a barn....""  And in that barn was presented some of the greatest shows you've never seen in any barn.  The whole thing got a bit silly, and only a superb exception could prove the rule that the genre was moribund (I refer to that grand exception, that greatest ever show-about-a-show, ""The Band Wagon."")The only thing left for the genre to do was to do a flip-flop.  And so we have ""Miss Congeniality,"" ""Drop Dead Gorgeous,"" and the most definitive one in the group ""Waiting for Guffman,"" as shows about shows that you wouldn't otherwise want to see at all!  Hollywood is now making fun about these shows that amateurs put on--they're so bad they're almost good.  At least they're funny.""Miss Congeniality"" and ""Drop Dead Gorgeous"" are about small-town beauty queen contests.  If you've seen one of these movies and liked it, I am absolutely certain you'll like the other one.  They're sufficiently similar and sufficiently different to make each one enjoyable on its own merits.  ""Miss Congeniality"" is much better plotted--in fact, the plot, a semi-mystery, is darn good.  However, ""Drop Dead Gorgeous"" is more darkly humorous--it's mordant humor at its near-best.  If only the author had figured out better ways of killing off the  rival contestants--having one of them burn to death just isn't funny at all, even though the author wanted it to be funny. The director made it worse by dwelling on the charred remains (not of her body--at least we were spared that one).  This kind of bad directing makes an audience wince and spoils the effect of the movie.  To go along with the poorer plot of ""Drop Dead Gorgeous"" is the director's inability to sort out the characters; to do comedy well, you need to know where a character is coming from, which in turns means that the character has to be consistent throughout the course of the movie.  The beauty contestant we're rooting for (or supposed to be rooting for) in ""Drop Dead Gorgeous"" is inconsistent, and that's a real problem.  This film could well have lost about ten minutes of running time, whereas ""Miss Congeniality,"" a much-better paced film, was only a couple of minutes too long in a scene or two, in my opinion.  What's next?  Someone will probably want to do a sequel to ""Miss Congeniality.""  But together with ""Guffman"" and ""Gorgeous,"" and some minor recent flicks about hair-styling contests and cheerleader contests, I think this genre is running out.  After you've seen ""Guffman,"" for example, not only will you avoid seeing any movie about amateur town productions, but you'll also probably stay away from the amateur production in your own town as well....",4,"See it with ""Drop Dead Gorgeous""",994291200,"07 5, 2001",2001,3328,"['Miss', 'Congeniality', 'Drop', 'Dead', 'Gorgeous', 'two', 'funnier', 'comedies', 'past', 'few', 'seasons', 'are', 'current', 'incarnations', 'old', 'Hollywood', 'tradition', 'show', 'show', 'Ever', 'Forty', 'Second', 'Street', 'backstage', 'musical', 'Hollywood', 'loved', 'use', 'indirect', 'approach', 'selling', 'singing', 'dancing', 'Instead', 'putting', 'song', 'dance', 'part', 'story', 'put', 'part', 'show', 'characters', 'story', 'are', 'aiming', 'put', '1940s', 'procedure', 'was', 'taken', 'extreme', 'Mickey', 'Rooney-Judy', 'Garland', 'musicals', 'giving', 'rise', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'all-time', 'great', 'cliches', 'hey', 'can', 'raise', 'money', 'putting', 'own', 'show', 'dad', 'got', 'barn', 'barn', 'was', 'presented', 'greatest', 'shows', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'barn', 'whole', 'thing', 'got', 'bit', 'silly', 'only', 'superb', 'exception', 'could', 'prove', 'rule', 'genre', 'was', 'moribund', 'refer', 'grand', 'exception', 'greatest', 'ever', 'show-about-a-show', 'Band', 'Wagon', 'only', 'thing', 'left', 'genre', 'do', 'was', 'do', 'flip-flop', 'so', 'have', 'Miss', 'Congeniality', 'Drop', 'Dead', 'Gorgeous', 'most', 'definitive', 'one', 'group', 'Waiting', 'Guffman', 'shows', 'shows', 'would', ""n't"", 'otherwise', 'want', 'see', 'Hollywood', 'now', 'making', 'fun', 'shows', 'amateurs', 'put', ""'re"", 'so', 'bad', ""'re"", 'almost', 'good', 'least', ""'re"", 'funny', 'Miss', 'Congeniality', 'Drop', 'Dead', 'Gorgeous', 'are', 'small-town', 'beauty', 'queen', 'contests', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'one', 'movies', 'liked', 'am', 'absolutely', 'certain', ""'ll"", 'like', 'other', 'one', ""'re"", 'sufficiently', 'similar', 'sufficiently', 'different', 'make', 'one', 'enjoyable', 'own', 'merits', 'Miss', 'Congeniality', 'much', 'better', 'plotted', 'fact', 'plot', 'semi-mystery', 'darn', 'good', 'However', 'Drop', 'Dead', 'Gorgeous', 'more', 'darkly', 'humorous', 'mordant', 'humor', 'near-best', 'only', 'author', 'had', 'figured', 'out', 'better', 'ways', 'killing', 'off', 'rival', 'contestants', 'having', 'one', 'burn', 'death', 'just', ""n't"", 'funny', 'even', 'author', 'wanted', 'be', 'funny', 'director', 'made', 'worse', 'dwelling', 'charred', 'remains', 'not', 'body', 'least', 'were', 'spared', 'one', 'kind', 'bad', 'directing', 'audience', 'wince', 'effect', 'movie', 'go', 'along', 'poorer', 'plot', 'Drop', 'Dead', 'Gorgeous', 'director', 'inability', 'sort', 'out', 'characters', 'do', 'comedy', 'well', 'need', 'know', 'where', 'character', 'coming', 'turns', 'means', 'character', 'be', 'consistent', 'course', 'movie', 'beauty', 'contestant', ""'re"", 'rooting', 'supposed', 'be', 'rooting', 'Drop', 'Dead', 'Gorgeous', 'inconsistent', 'real', 'problem', 'film', 'could', 'well', 'have', 'lost', 'ten', 'minutes', 'running', 'time', 'Miss', 'Congeniality', 'much-better', 'paced', 'film', 'was', 'only', 'couple', 'minutes', 'too', 'long', 'scene', 'two', 'opinion', 'What', 'next', 'Someone', 'will', 'probably', 'want', 'do', 'sequel', 'Miss', 'Congeniality', 'together', 'Guffman', 'Gorgeous', 'minor', 'recent', 'flicks', 'hair-styling', 'contests', 'cheerleader', 'contests', 'think', 'genre', 'running', 'out', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Guffman', 'example', 'not', 'only', 'will', 'avoid', 'seeing', 'movie', 'amateur', 'town', 'productions', ""'ll"", 'also', 'probably', 'stay', 'away', 'amateur', 'production', 'own', 'town', 'as', 'well']",N/A

This film wouldn't of been as good if someone else had played Sandra's part. She plays a cop who goes undercover as a beauty pageant contestant to try to find out who's going to bomb the pageant show. The film is incredibly predictable, but very fun. You can pretty much tell what's going to happen through the entire movie. Sandra is at her most adorable in this movie. She has an incredible knack for this type of comedy. She is the master at this. Benjamin Bratt, as her co-worker, is completely wasted. His role is a very cliched part. You can smell them getting together before the movie's opening credits are over. The really best parts of this movie are Michael Caine and Candace Bergen. First of all, it's a real delight to see the former Murphy Brown on the big screen. Hope it happens often. Michael Caine is the pageant expert. He tries to turn Sandra into a believeable contestant. This is by far Sir Michael's finest comedic performance. He is, and always will be, one of cinema's finest.

After the opening scene on the playground, this thing took a nosedive and never gained altitude. Bullock's character causes a fellow cop to get shot. She shows her concern, not by going to the hospital to check on his condition, but by breaking things at home and pounding on a punching bag. I am stunned at all the 5-star reviews. Some paid critics even gave it good reviews. Makes me concerned about the state of our country. I finally turned it off when she got to the beauty contest site. Oh, and I'm someone who enjoyed Speed and While You Were Sleeping, so it's nothing to do with Bullock or lightweight entertainment. Very seldom do I abandon a movie. I'm always hoping it will get better, but this thing had an endless onslaught of completely throw-away lines.

Her character provides a undeniable proof that a silk purse can defintely be made from a sow's ear. For while Gracie Lou clumsily swimsuits, shimmies, and stilettoes her way toward the glittering grand finale, she and we learn several salient lessons about the stupidity of judging a book by its cover.The unremarkable supporting cast is given an indelible boost by the comedic presence of William Shatner and Michael Caine, who play a network pageant co-host and a dried up pageant consultant. Shatner is totally hilarious amid the chaos of the pageant's grand finale scenes, and Caine's rapier sharp sarcastic wit and humour is a welcome ingredient in the movie's recipe. However, the lovely, effervescent Sandra Bullock proves yet again to her fans that she is one of those rare actresses whose work can be enjoyed by a greater cross-section of the community. Not only that, but she has &quot;it&quot;- that indefinable something that evey performer should possess, but is sadly lacking in Hollywood nowadays. However, even if she wasn't in showbusiness, Ms Bullock would still be somebody that other people would notice and remember.Can &quot;Miss Congeniality&quot; be described as fluff?

We enjoyed ourselves, had some good laughs but seeing it once was more than enough.  This is based on an FBI agent's (Bullock's) having to go undercover in a Miss America-like pageant as a contestant to prevent a terrorist event.  It pokes gentle fun at beauty pageants in general and promotes a romance between star FBI agents Sandra Bullock and Benjamin Bratt.  There are some over the top performances by Candace Bergen, William Shatner and Michael Caine, all involved with the pageant from business stand points.  I can't say any of those three distinguished him/herself here but they were ok.  There seems to a recent deluge of these beauty pageant movies. ""Beautiful"" with Minnie Driver is another and she portrays the self absorbed aspect of such a contestant pretty well.  However, the movie gets very sidetracked with the issue of whether she is the real mother of her niece or not.  Another is ""Drop Dead Gorgeous"" which takes the broadest satiric swipe at beauty pageants, involving a talent demonstration that is probably worse even than actually ever seen in a pageant (which is saying a lot). My favorite beauty pageant movie is""Smile"" from the 1970s with Bruce Dern in the lead as a mover and shaker in the pageant world.  It contains all the cynicism and realism missing from these other versions.  ""Miss Congeniality"" probably is the best romance vehicle of all of them and if you are looking for a pleasant romantic comedy with an attractive leading man (Bratt), this will do nicely.  However, I would really love to see an entirely different movie than has yet been made about beauty pageants.  I would love to see a first rate writer-director, such as Oliver Stone, take on beauty pageants and show us the true underside of them as he did with football in ""Any Given Sunday.""  Until then, the above movies are what we've got instead. Naive fool that I was, I never imagined that beauty pageants would still be with us in the year 2001, much less that the USA would have seen a real-world child beauty pageant murder, the Ramsey one.",4,Women Will Enjoy This Romance Vehicle Once,989712000,"05 13, 2001",2001,2181,"['amusing', 'trifle', 'friend', 'Joyce', 'took', 'Cinemark', 'theater', 'matinee', 'right', 'went', 'video/DVD', 'enjoyed', 'had', 'good', 'laughs', 'seeing', 'once', 'was', 'more', 'enough', 'based', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Bullock', 'having', 'go', 'undercover', 'Miss', 'America-like', 'pageant', 'contestant', 'prevent', 'terrorist', 'event', 'gentle', 'fun', 'beauty', 'pageants', 'general', 'romance', 'star', 'FBI', 'agents', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'Benjamin', 'Bratt', 'are', 'top', 'performances', 'Candace', 'Bergen', 'William', 'Shatner', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'involved', 'pageant', 'business', 'stand', 'points', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'three', 'distinguished', 'here', 'were', 'ok', 'recent', 'deluge', 'beauty', 'pageant', 'movies', 'Beautiful', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'self', 'absorbed', 'aspect', 'contestant', 'pretty', 'well', 'However', 'movie', 'very', 'sidetracked', 'issue', 'real', 'mother', 'niece', 'not', 'Drop', 'Dead', 'Gorgeous', 'broadest', 'satiric', 'swipe', 'beauty', 'pageants', 'involving', 'talent', 'demonstration', 'probably', 'worse', 'even', 'actually', 'ever', 'seen', 'pageant', 'saying', 'lot', 'favorite', 'beauty', 'pageant', 'movie', 'Smile', '1970s', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'lead', 'mover', 'shaker', 'pageant', 'world', 'cynicism', 'realism', 'missing', 'other', 'versions', 'Miss', 'Congeniality', 'probably', 'best', 'romance', 'vehicle', 'are', 'looking', 'pleasant', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'attractive', 'leading', 'man', 'Bratt', 'will', 'do', 'nicely', 'However', 'would', 'really', 'love', 'see', 'entirely', 'different', 'movie', 'yet', 'been', 'made', 'beauty', 'pageants', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'first', 'rate', 'writer-director', 'such', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'take', 'beauty', 'pageants', 'show', 'true', 'underside', 'did', 'football', 'Any', 'Given', 'Sunday', 'then', 'above', 'movies', 'are', 'what', ""'ve"", 'got', 'instead', 'Naive', 'fool', 'was', 'never', 'imagined', 'beauty', 'pageants', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'year', '2001', 'much', 'less', 'USA', 'would', 'have', 'seen', 'real-world', 'child', 'beauty', 'pageant', 'murder', 'Ramsey', 'one']",N/A

It's not something I am proud of, but it was a busy night at the old video store, and I took what I could get. Maybe it's just me, but what was this movie supposed to be?The premise isn't bad. Actually I like the idea of the FBI trying to put a frumpy agent undercover as one of the world most beautiful women. Unfortunately you really need a little bit of believability to try to pull this off. The big problem is that the FBI is made up to be some sort of bumbling group of morons that can't go five minutes without making some crude comment about a woman's physique. So anyway, the FBI decides to send it's (seemingly) worst group of agents to apprehend a serial killer who is supposedly stalking a beauty pageant. Soon lots and lots of jokes and bit's are paraded around at the expense of the contestants, and along the way our heroine manages to fall in love, while learning that you can't judge a book by it's cover. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah! Okay here's my biggest problem. Bullock is supposed to this smart top notch FBI agent who hates all of the &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; stereotypes. Then why does she fall in love with a man that wouldn't even give her the time of day until she got all &quot;gussied up&quot;? Is she really more shallow than we thought? I know I'm amking too much of this, but let's at least try to pick a statement a stick to it.This movie has two and half saving graces: 1.Sandra Bullock, 2. Michael Caine and 1/2 is William Shatner and Candice Bergen. (I only give them 1/2 because they just aren't in it long enough) Bullock manages to bring a great deal of charm and wit to a script that did it's best to keep her down. And Caine effortlessly steals nearly every scene in which he appears as the flamboyant pageant coach. Shatner and Bergen are perfect as the aging pageant veterans (see Burt Parks). On the downside Ben Bratt proves the theory that good hair and nice smile can only take you so far. I really liked him on Law &amp; Order, and maybe I shouldn't blame him for the awful material he was given to read. But then again, I have to assume he saw the script before filming began.&quot;Miss Congeniality&quot; does have some very funny moments, but just not enough to overcome the rest of this very dull movie.

So, the film would have a sisters-are-doing-it-for-themselves feel (even the arch-villain is female, rather than Dennis Hopper doing is rent-a-cackle) were it not for the fact that it's a beauty pageant and it's the year 2001.And the film never quite gets round that one. Sandra gets an important speech at the film's conclusions, in which she essentially validates the whole pageant industry, but it's hardly a knockdown argument, relying in our investment in her character (or indeed, the actor) rather than any conclusive logic for its conviction. I mean, it seems to me that Miss America its still about women in swimsuits, at the end of the day, and until someone who looks merely slightly-above-average in a swimsuit actually wins the damn thing it always will be.There are other flaws, too. Michael Caine as camp and bitter is discordant rather than funny, Benjamin Bratt is somewhat plastic here, and the other contestants are rather 1 dimensional. (See, the main dramatic supporting roles are male. Even at Miss America ...)On the other hand, I found it a hard movie to actually dislike. Sandra Bullock would be watchable reading the phone book, and sure enough she's watchable here. A lot of her characterisation is done courtesy of an 'unfeminine' laugh, which I found infectious but to which I imagine large swathes of the population (the male swathe, perhaps) might have a higher immunity. And she gets almost all the best lines, but as she appears to have the best delivery of anyone in the cast, this does not seem inappropriate. The plot itself is essentially irrelevant, beyond the highest-of-high concepts that the trailer explains.I suppose one could play the what-if game - what if the writers had taken their bravery pills and played down the supporting men, shifting the focus more to the contestants and away from the notably all male FBI. What if Benjamin Bratt hadn't had his mind elsewhere? What if the writing had been 50% sharper?But on the other hand, what if it hadn't been Sandra Bullock? Direct to cable, I suspect.So, if you like Sandra Bullock then watch this gentle comedy with medium hopes and you'll be happy.",3,Near-miss America,986774400,"04 9, 2001",2001,2729,"['So', 'Sandra', 'B', 'vehicle', 'had', 'puzzling', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'Hope', 'Floats', 'was', 'quiet', 'okay', 'Practical', 'Magic', 'was', 'not', 'terribly', 'magical', 'okay', 'then', 'gave', 'up', 'trailer', 'Miss', 'Congeniality', 'dragged', 'back', 'cinema', 'set-up', 'unfeminine', 'FBI', 'agent', 'undercover', 'Miss', 'America', 'seemed', 'promised', 'something', 'tiny', 'bit', 'left-of-centre', 'film', 'Yes', 'tiny', 'bit', 'left-of-centre', 'Sandra', 'fellow', 'contestants', 'are', 'not', 'thankfully', 'surprisingly', 'least', 'bit', 'air-headed', 'men', 'centres', 'universe', 'are', 'notably', 'absent', 'So', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'sisters-are-doing-it-for-themselves', 'feel', 'even', 'arch-villain', 'female', 'rather', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'doing', 'rent-a-cackle', 'were', 'not', 'fact', 'beauty', 'pageant', 'year', '2001.And', 'film', 'never', 'quite', 'round', 'one', 'Sandra', 'important', 'speech', 'film', 'conclusions', 'essentially', 'whole', 'pageant', 'industry', 'hardly', 'knockdown', 'argument', 'relying', 'investment', 'character', 'indeed', 'actor', 'rather', 'conclusive', 'logic', 'conviction', 'mean', 'Miss', 'America', 'still', 'women', 'swimsuits', 'end', 'day', 'someone', 'who', 'merely', 'slightly-above-average', 'swimsuit', 'actually', 'damn', 'thing', 'always', 'will', 'be.There', 'are', 'other', 'flaws', 'too', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'camp', 'bitter', 'discordant', 'rather', 'funny', 'Benjamin', 'Bratt', 'somewhat', 'plastic', 'here', 'other', 'contestants', 'are', 'rather', '1', 'dimensional', 'See', 'main', 'dramatic', 'supporting', 'roles', 'are', 'male', 'Even', 'Miss', 'America', 'other', 'hand', 'found', 'hard', 'movie', 'actually', 'dislike', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'would', 'be', 'watchable', 'reading', 'phone', 'book', 'sure', 'enough', 'watchable', 'here', 'lot', 'characterisation', 'done', 'courtesy', ""'unfeminine"", 'laugh', 'found', 'infectious', 'imagine', 'large', 'swathes', 'population', 'male', 'swathe', 'perhaps', 'might', 'have', 'higher', 'immunity', 'almost', 'best', 'lines', 'have', 'best', 'delivery', 'anyone', 'cast', 'not', 'seem', 'inappropriate', 'plot', 'essentially', 'irrelevant', 'highest-of-high', 'concepts', 'trailer', 'explains.I', 'suppose', 'one', 'could', 'play', 'what-if', 'game', 'what', 'writers', 'had', 'taken', 'bravery', 'pills', 'played', 'down', 'supporting', 'men', 'shifting', 'focus', 'more', 'contestants', 'away', 'notably', 'male', 'FBI', 'What', 'Benjamin', 'Bratt', 'had', ""n't"", 'had', 'mind', 'elsewhere', 'What', 'writing', 'had', 'been', '50', '%', 'sharper', 'other', 'hand', 'what', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'Direct', 'cable', 'suspect.So', 'like', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'then', 'watch', 'gentle', 'comedy', 'medium', 'hopes', ""'ll"", 'be', 'happy']",N/A

576472,A2VD3CYOEMJ6SR,B00005AAA9,David E. Levine,"[4, 5]","Sandra Bullock is fabulous in the role of a tomboyish, gritty, somewhat klutzy FBI agent Gracie Hart. The story is almost a ""Pygmalion"" or ""My Fair Lady"" as an urbane Englishman (played by Michael Caine) seeks to transform Gracie into a lady. The reason is that there has been a coded warning that the Miss United States Beauty pageant is going to be victimized by a terrorist attack. Gracie, is needed for the purpose of going undercover, thus she is transformed into ""Miss New Jersey.""In addition to the My Fair Lady similarity, there is also an element of ""Rooster Cogburn."" In that movie, John Wayne is a Marshall who has his badge taken away due to screw ups but, alas, he is recruited back when he is needed to solve a crime. So too, Gracie has just been assigned to desk duty after she has screwed up an operation but, after an exhaustive search for someone to go underecover, she is reactivated when she emerges as the only possible agent for the job. She is reluctant to take on this role but, predictably enough, is cajoled into it. Also, predictably enough, she views her fellow pageant competitors as bubble heads and has a rather disdainful attitude towards them but,as she gets to know them and form relationships, her estimation of them rises as she enters into genuine friendships.Candace Bergen is well cast as a former pageant winner who is now the director of it. She is sweet and proper on the outside but, has a dark and calculating underside. Given both this portrayal and her physical resemblence, she would be perfect if they ever have to cast someone to play Martha Stewart!!This movie, despite its predictability, is genuinely entertaining. Now that there is a sequel, the question is whether this has been played out to the point where none is merited. Perhaps, I will ultimately see ""Miss Congeiality 2"" and give my opinion in a later review.

It succeeds admirably with its goal. &quot;Miss Congeniality&quot; is funny and well-paced, slapstick in parts, but all Sandra Bullock.Gracie Hart (Bullock) is a rough and tumble FBI agent who is both clumsy and skilled in self-defense, a woman who pounds her punching bag after a frustrating day at work. She is the unlikely candidate to go undercover at a beauty pageant, but she's the only one in the bureau office who looks good in a computerized bathing suit. Michael Caine is hilarious as the man in charge of making her over in two days, and Benjamin Bratt is convincingly clueless and charming as her friend and sudden supervisor. Candice Bergen and William Shatner, as the pageant's directors, are brilliant casting choices.While Sandra Bullock goes overboard at times making her character uncouth and uncoordinated, she completely carries this movie with her on-screen presence. Her makeover is convincing because Bullock never allows us to forget what lies underneath the sheen.The best part of the DVD is not the movie itself. It's the running commentary of Bullock and co-writer Marc Lawrence found in the special features menu. I almost watched this movie twice in one sitting as I listened to them joke and tell the background of the filming and writing from the beginning to the end of the movie.

on the playground(Mary Ashleigh Green).We are introduced to the adult Gracie as she botches an undercover operation at a Russian restaurant, much to the dismay of her partner, Eric Matthews (Benjamin Bratt), and facing a subsequent reprimand from her boss, FBI Assistant Director, Harry McDonald (Ernie Hudson).Despite Hart's cock-up, Agent Matthews is selected to put together his own team to work on a case that takes them to the Miss United States Pageant in San Antonio, Texas, where they must quell a situation of  potential domestic terrorism.They meet with Pageant Director, Kathy Morningside (a cooly refined yet comically sinister Candace Bergen) and her co-host Stan Fields(William Shatner), who turn Gracie, who will go undercover as Miss New Jersey, over to pageant consultant Victor Melling(a sophisticated and sarcastic Michael Caine), who reluctantly grooms the unrefined Hart for her new role within the few days he has to complete the task.Under Victor's guidance, Gracie comes out looking like a contestant, but she still stumbles periodically.Arriving for the orientation luncheon, she is quickly befriended by Miss Rhode Island, Cheryl Frasier(Heather Burns), as well as Miss Texas Mary Jo Wright (Deirdre Quinn), Miss New York, Karen Krantz (Melissa De Sousa), Miss California, Leslie Davis( Wendy Raquel Robinson), and Miss Hawaii, Alana Krewson(Asia De Marcos), while struggling to keep her cover.We follow the agents through the welcoming banquets, rehearsals, Gracie's antagonistic coaching sessions with Victor, friendly encounters with Cheryl and the aforementioned contestants as Gracie helps boost Cheryl's occasionally waning self esteem, aggravation from Kathy's assistant Frank Tobin(Steve Monroe), mysterious threats from Kathy, nights out on the town with the girls, the improvisation of Gracie's talent performance(much to Eric's physical detriment), and misleading evidence before all is resolved, and despite nearly blowing her cover,we see Hart's gut instincts vindicated.But in just that brief time, we see Gracie Hart grow as a person, gaining a few grateful friends along the way.Viewers are in for a light and lively good time when

I've managed to avoid most of them, but I've seen sections of it enough that my gut level reaction is to make a Frisbee out of the DVD. Having good impulse control, however, I don't.Now on to the movie itself--Basic plot: A beauty contest has been threatened and the FBI plants a female agent inside the contest. The agent, in spite of being female, has none of the ""graces"" expected of women. While she's great at unarmed combat and she groups her shots tightly on target, her ability to navigate in high heels and act ""feminine"" is lacking. This is supposed to be funny and exciting at the same time. I found it nearly amusing the first time around.Three major themes emerge in the movie: 1) self-esteem, 2) cultural expectations of women, and 3) a ""terrorist"" plot. The manifest story line (the ""terrorist plot"") does not shine brightly. Candace Bergen and Will Shatner should chide their agents for getting them involved in this one. If you want a good thriller that will keep you sitting on the edge of your chair, look elsewhere. This barely rates a single star.The second theme gives the movie a beautiful haze of irony. In a beauty pageant, cultural feminine expectations are most exaggerated. In this flick, we see this in sharp relief to Sandra Bullock's kick-[posterior]-tom-boy-macho approach to life. Although the pressure is on for Sandra to conform, she negotiates her own solution, finds her own way of being, confronting and subverting the expectations placed upon her. In the end, her nonconformity saves the day. I'm glad my daughter has chosen this movie to watch repeatedly. I want her to have the message that cultural (or boy friend) expectations can be challenged and subverted. I want her to have the courage to think for and be herself.Which brings us to the final theme--self-esteem. Bullock's character is the most transformed during this story. She goes from feeling inferior about her femininity to owning it in her own way. What a great gender message! Unfortunately, the vehicle is corny, trite, and mostly annoying after the first viewing...One and a half stars for content.

Besides Sandra's dominance of the film as FBI Agent Gracie (Graceful) Snow (Pure)--get the name?, support comes from nearly everyone. Michael Caine is hired by FBI Agent Benjamin Bratt (the hunk from Law &amp; Order) to help the rather unfeminine Sandra compete as a contestant for Miss America.As always, Caine plays the character flawlessly and, in addition, also happens to be gay adding a flamboyance to the role. Despite his comedic importance, Captain Kirk (William Shatner), a little feminine himself, is the pageant emcee. Kirk? He pulls it off well even without the Klingons. Candace Bergen is the head of the pageant and a former Miss America and isn't her Murphy Brown self but she's not supposed to be--watch to find out why.Sandra is thrust into the role to thwart an assassination of pageant winner. Even though most would like Sandra to win, she can't and somehow finds the killer, delivers some punch with Caine, makes her boss (Bratt) get the hots for her, and ends up being just one of the girls.The film is a delicious take-off of the &quot;beauty syndrome&quot; with Sandra bringing in pizza and beer to the objections of some contestants that it'll make them fat. Sandra says, &quot;Well, she's just going to throw it up anyway.&quot;Despite a unnoticed thin plot--comedies don't need elaborate plots as the bozo that reviewed this article for Amazon.com says, Sandra and her ensemble of dimwitted FBI agents, a flaming Beauty Consultant Caine, and Captain Kirk makes this film a must see. It is certainly Sandra's redemption for 28 Days. 28 days was funny in parts but Miss Congeniality was funny from beginning to end.

""Miss Congeniality"" is by far the biggest production and the best of the lot.  Sandra Bullock (who also co-produced) plays Gracie Hart, a homely FBI agent who goes undercover at the Miss United States beauty pageant to catch a terrorist who has threatened to blow up the pageant.The story is funny and Bullock shows her range, proving to be an excellent comedian in addition to her proven talents as a dramatic actor.  The writers poke the typical fun at pageants and contestants throughout the film, but they develop a conscience at the end when Gracie gets teary-eyed admitting what a great experience it was.  There is plenty of silly slapstick humor.  Bullock does her runway thing with aplomb, and her tongue firmly in cheek.  Michael Caine is wonderfully droll as the beauty consultant who is given the impossible task of turning the ugly duckling into a swan.Interestingly, this is not the first film where Sandra Bullock makes the beast to beauty transition.  In one of her early films in 1991 (""Love Potion Number 9""), she plays a geek who discovers a love potion and turns into a knockout.  That film was an early indication of her comedic talents, but she eschewed zany comedy for dramatic and romantic roles for many years after that.  It is good to see her return to it.This is a very light and entertaining film that is easy to watch and easy to forget.  At over $100 million gross it had plenty of mass appeal.

576508,A20FK68BUB1IVA,B00005AAA9,Happy Reader,"[0, 0]","""Miss Congeniality"" is a very funny movie. Maybe it's a little predictable, but it is full of heart and humor and fantastic acting.Grace Hart (the incredible Sandra Bullock), an FBI agent who goofs up a little too often, goes undercover at the Miss United States pageant on Operation Thong. A serial killer, who calls himself just ""Citizen"", has left clues that the pageant is his next target. Grace is truly a diamond in the rough, and the FBI hires Victor Melling, pageant pro (played by the amazing Michael Caine), to bring her up to beauty queen standards in only two days.Great supporting characters include Candice Bergen as Kathy Morningside, the uptight pageant director, and William Shatner, in a hilarious send-up, as the oblivious pageant host, Stan Fields.""Wear the crown. Be the crown. You ARE the crown!""DVD Special Features:1. Commentary Track #1. Commentators are Sandra Bullock, who everyone else calls Sandy, and Marc Lawrence, the executive producer and screenwriter. It's fun listening to Sandy and Marc, because they're good friends, and there was a lot of ad-libbing in the movie. Marc is careful to mention, though, that Sandy ""did all her own eating in this movie"". And when you watch the movie you'll see why that's funny. There are several lines that are homage to other movies, and I'm sorry to say that I didn't notice any of them until Marc pointed them out in this commentary.2. Commentary Track #2, by Donald Petrie, director. Don says that the biggest challenge in the entire movie was making Sandy look homely and shapeless. Carefully selected clothes, make-up, hair and even lighting were needed to make a stab at this. Grace's graceless snorting was a little idea that turned into a whole lot of fun. And Petrie has nothing but praise for Bergen and Shatner's comic touch. ""Stan needed to be larger than life to fill Bert Parks' shoes and Bill Shatner was wonderful. He totally embraced the roll, and, as life imitates art, he has just been set to host the real USA pageant this year."" (The movie was issued in 2000, this Deluxe Edition in 2005.)It's not just the actors Petrie praises. At one point he says, ""People don't often notice the soundwork that goes into a movie. They are really the unsung heroes of the movie business."" [Of course, this made me think of TV shows I've seen where a car careening on a gravel road is accompanied by tire screeches on asphalt.]3. ""Preparing for the Pageant"" (8 minutes) Commentators include Donald Petrie, Sandra Bullock, Susie DeSanto (costume designer), Benjamin Bratt (plays FBI agent Eric Matthews), Michael Caine, Jack Gill (stunt coordinator), William Shatner. This short is fun to watch, including clips, outtakes, rehearsals and deleted scenes.4. ""The Pageant"" (10 minutes) This is a continuation of extra #3, and also fun. Some of the commentators are the same, with the addition of Candice Bergen and Peter Larkin (production designer). Caine says, ""My wife is a beauty queen, she came third in Miss World.... She taught me masses of little tricks."" Perhaps the trick of using hemorroid cream to get rid of the bags under your eyes?5. Missing Scenes. There are 3 scenes which were cut from the final movie:-- A. The Dancing Scene. This was Sandra's goofy dance demonstration during the practice for the 50 contestants big number.-- B. The Wedding Scene. Near the beginning of the movie, Grace's father is married. Cutting this scene led to the biggest continuity gaff, where Grace is wearing a big corsage on her suit lapel in the FBI office.-- C. The De-Throning of Miss New Jersey Scene. Grace and Eric visit the original Miss New Jersey to convince her to drop out so Grace can take her place in the pageant.6. ""Sneek Peek at ""Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous"" (9 minutes) This is more than a trailer, but is a little short with several commentators: John Pasquin (director), Sandra Bullock (reprises her role as Grace), Marc Lawrence (once again writer and producer), William Shatner (plays Stan again), Diedrich Bader (plays Joel Myers), Heather Burns (reprises her role as Cheryl Frasier, who won the Miss USA pageant in the 1st movie), Regina King (plays Same Fuller, Grace's new female partner), Treat Williams (plays Walter Collins, L.A. FBI).7. ""Do You Have What It Takes to Be a Beauty Queen?"" This is a great little 19-question quiz along the lines of a personality test. William Shatner gives you the multiple choice questions. At the end, he tells you how likely you are to win a beauty pageant. There is humor in the choices given you and even more humor at the end, when Shatner gives you your reading based on your answers. I took the quiz twice, selecting different answers the second time, and it was fun. One time I was likely to be 1st runner up because I wouldn't like and manipulate, the other time I was going to win because I had claws and wasn't afraid to use them.8.

Bullock was starting to be a good actress in good films, but now she has turned to being a good actress in some good films. She really needs to pick it up to a great actress in brilliant movies, or her career will turn to cow poo.When a serial killer indicates that his next target is the Miss United States beauty pageant, the FBI decides that they must get an undercover agent as a participant in the contest. A search uncovers no suitable candidate other than a bumbling female agent Gracie Hart (Sandra Bullock). Reluctantly her captain McDonald (Ernie Hudson) agrees to let her join the team working the case. The team is led by a womanising agent Eric Matthews (Benjamin Bratt) who has an apparent reluctant attraction to Gracie. She enters as Miss New Jersey replacing a contestant who was discovered to have acted in a porno film. The pageant managers Kathy Morningside and Stan Fields (Candice Bergen, William Shatner) are immediately aghast about the agent appearing in the pageant, but arrange a top handler Victor Melling (Michael Caine) to come give her a quick makeover with the expected outstanding results. Unfortunately she still is bumbling. When the killer is suddenly caught, everything seems to be over, except the female agent tries to convince her boss that something is still not right. She has discovered that the pageant managers are being dismissed after 21 years for younger people and Kathy may not be as solid as she seems on the surface.Bullock is extremely watchable as a detective who makes fun of beauty pageants, but when she starts taking them seriously, her performance drops to a much less engaging standard. Michael Caine sleep-walk's through the entire movie, his performance is nothing to shout about, and the script, although sometimes mysterious, leads itself to an unrealistic and dumb finale. There are a couple of high-points, like when Gracie answers the question ""What is most important for the world?"" she and the writer come up with a terrific answer. But, Miss Congeniality still keeps tripping (just like Bullock's character) and missing its target. We don't care who wins the pageant, we don't care who falls in love and mainly, and we don't care about the conclusion of the problem.

I found Bullock to be believable as klutzy FBI agent Gracie Hart, forced to go undercover as a beauty pageant contestant. I really enjoyed the moments in this film when Gracie Hart didn't quite get on top of the whole beauty pageant mentality, when she slipped out of character and lets the real person, flaws and all, show. Michael Caine is superb as the man behind the woman, playing a gay beauty consultant who is nearly overwhelmed by the challenge of transforming Bullock/Gracie Hart into a credible pageant contestant.  As if this weren't enough, the DVD has all the extras that provide a close-up look at the making of this film. There are some funny out takes, two documentaries, two feature-length audio commentaries (one with Bullock and co-screenwriter Mark Lawrence, the other with director Donald Petrie)...and much more.

Sandra may not be a great actress, but she has real screen appeal, in the vein of Julia Roberts (who has more acting skill), because we feel she is real, and her personality shines through her characters.  She deserved the Golden Globe, and should have a long romantic comedy career.  Comedic timing and physical comedy?  She can and does do it in this film.Ensemble?  The casting director was incredibly fortunate to get Michael Caine to recreate his &quot;cunning twit&quot; role that he last shared with us as a scoundrel with Steve Martin.  He has some great lines, and it feels as though he has fun with his role. Candice Bergen, William Shatner &amp; Benjamin Bratt are all fun to watch, although none of them manages to go &quot;over the top&quot; and shine in this comedy.  Bullock should stick to the kind of leading men she had in &quot;While You Were Sleeping&quot; and &quot;28 Days&quot;.  (Sort of everyday heroes instead of face candy like Bratt and Ben Affleck, her leading man in &quot;Forces of Nature&quot;.)So...the target audience is really preteens, and I know they will love it and will wear out your DVD.

Gracie is nothing of a beauty pageant contestant and would rather spend time with her boys at the FBI like her boss in this mission Eric.(Bratt) She has to look the part of the contestant so she hires Victor(Caine) to help her. He being the expert that he is in this field has three days to turn the ultimate slob tomboy into a beauty queen. Despite all of that Gracie must figure out who is the inside man and save the pageant.The movie works pretty well one of the main reasons is the great cast.Sandra Bullock is terrific in the film. It's amazing what makeup can do to a woman. She is so believable and unattractive as the tomboy. When she comes out though decked out and they have Tom Jones ""She's A Lady"" playing you really have a big draw dropper. She put a lot of energy into the part and she also produced it. She believed in the project and it was a big success because of her.Michael Caine was awesome in the film. His character in the movie is a homosexual and Caine takes the part and runs with it. He is believable as the pageant expert. Caine is such a great actor because he can play with emotions. He goes from serious to flamboyant all the time in this movie and its fun. It's a fun character for him and he's fantastic in the film.Guys you will want to watch the movie for the girls. There are a ton of beautiful woman in it. Almost all of the actresses who play the contestants are gorgeous woman. Bullock looks great in the film and there are plenty of things that you will find funny.Guys go get your girl and watch this film. Heck, everybody go get this film because it's an awesome movie. I was quite impressed with it and im not ashamed to say I own it.

576587,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00005AAA9,Matthew Horner,"[1, 2]","Miss Congeniality is an affable comedy which is pleasant enough to watch. The problems it has are due to the fact that it doesn't aspire to anything more. It was produced by its star, Sandra Bullock, and she seems to have been afraid of offending anyone. The trouble with this sometimes noble goal is that, by playing to the middle, you risk the perils of mediocrity. The film doesn't work as satire or as a screwball comedy.What Miss Congeniality does succeed at is slapstick, and some of this is very funny. Ms. Bullock is not afraid to take a fall or wear bad clothes or put a look on her face that is laughable. I can't help but like someone who will do all that, if she thinks she can entertain an audience. Bullock can indeed do that, and it is unfortunate that over the years her choices of material have been so hit or miss.Bullock plays Gracie Hart, an FBI agent who is such a slob that any femininity she may possess remains totally out of sight. She also have a problem with anger management, and this sets up one of the movie's funniest scenes. After nearly getting another agent killed, Hart storms into her apartment and promptly trips over her bed, which she then tries to kick to pieces. She moves on to the kitchen where she have a nasty encounter with a microwave over. Going back into the bedroom, she again trips over the bed. This time she takes her fury out on a punching bag that apparently is a permanent fixture in her living room. This scene shows us that this is the way Hart's life has gone so far.When the FBI learns that a mad bomber may be about to target a beauty pageant, Hart is dying to be on the case, but no one, not even her partner Eric [Benjamin Bratt], wants her help. Then someone has the idea of putting an agent in the pageant as a contestant. After much searching, it turns out that Hart is the only one available. A beauty pageant 'expert' [Michael Caine] has forty-eight hours to transform Hart from an ugly duckling to a swan. Meanwhile, the hope is that, by being on the inside, Hart can learn the identity of the bomber before it's too late.This is broad comedy. It is neither original nor very bright, but it has a great deal of energy and several amusing scenes. It is greatly helped by the presence of Mr. Caine, as well as by Candice Bergen as the pageant's director. Their scenes with Ms. Bullock are great, and one can only wish that Miss Congeniality's writing talent had been on par with its acting talent.",3,Affable comedy could have been edgier,1016236800,"03 16, 2002",2002,2464,"['Miss', 'Congeniality', 'affable', 'comedy', 'pleasant', 'enough', 'watch', 'problems', 'are', 'due', 'fact', ""n't"", 'aspire', 'anything', 'more', 'was', 'produced', 'star', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'have', 'been', 'afraid', 'offending', 'anyone', 'trouble', 'noble', 'goal', 'playing', 'middle', 'risk', 'perils', 'mediocrity', 'film', ""n't"", 'work', 'as', 'satire', 'screwball', 'comedy.What', 'Miss', 'Congeniality', 'succeed', 'slapstick', 'very', 'funny', 'Ms.', 'Bullock', 'not', 'afraid', 'take', 'fall', 'wear', 'bad', 'clothes', 'put', 'look', 'face', 'laughable', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'someone', 'who', 'will', 'do', 'can', 'entertain', 'audience', 'Bullock', 'can', 'indeed', 'do', 'unfortunate', 'years', 'choices', 'material', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'hit', 'miss.Bullock', 'plays', 'Gracie', 'Hart', 'FBI', 'agent', 'who', 'slob', 'femininity', 'may', 'possess', 'remains', 'totally', 'sight', 'also', 'have', 'problem', 'anger', 'management', 'up', 'one', 'movie', 'funniest', 'scenes', 'nearly', 'getting', 'agent', 'killed', 'Hart', 'apartment', 'promptly', 'trips', 'bed', 'then', 'kick', 'pieces', 'kitchen', 'where', 'have', 'nasty', 'encounter', 'microwave', 'over', 'Going', 'back', 'bedroom', 'again', 'trips', 'bed', 'time', 'fury', 'out', 'punching', 'bag', 'apparently', 'permanent', 'fixture', 'living', 'room', 'scene', 'way', 'Hart', 'life', 'gone', 'so', 'far.When', 'FBI', 'mad', 'bomber', 'may', 'be', 'target', 'beauty', 'pageant', 'Hart', 'dying', 'be', 'case', 'one', 'not', 'even', 'partner', 'Eric', '[', 'Benjamin', 'Bratt', ']', 'help', 'Then', 'someone', 'idea', 'putting', 'agent', 'pageant', 'contestant', 'much', 'searching', 'out', 'Hart', 'only', 'one', 'available', 'beauty', 'pageant', '[', 'Michael', 'Caine', ']', 'forty-eight', 'hours', 'transform', 'Hart', 'ugly', 'duckling', 'swan', 'Meanwhile', 'hope', 'being', 'inside', 'Hart', 'can', 'learn', 'identity', 'bomber', 'too', 'late.This', 'broad', 'comedy', 'original', 'very', 'bright', 'great', 'deal', 'energy', 'several', 'amusing', 'scenes', 'greatly', 'helped', 'presence', 'Mr.', 'Caine', 'as', 'well', 'Candice', 'Bergen', 'pageant', 'director', 'scenes', 'Ms.', 'Bullock', 'are', 'great', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'wish', 'Miss', 'Congeniality', 'writing', 'talent', 'had', 'been', 'par', 'acting', 'talent']",N/A

There are no big laughs as the film is never allowed to parody it's subject to then hilt. The filmmakers were too busy  making sure we realised beauty queens were people too, this weakens what could have been a great satire.  The script is quite limp and to their credit the cast do well with what there is. A word of warning though, the best joke was in the advert.

Ditzy, clumsy, funny - the list goes on. Wouldn't it be nice to see Sandy in a horror movie? Nice little something to add to her CV.She exec-produced this, and along with Marc Lawrence, had an instant hit. Then she did Two Weeks Notice. I'm sorry, but the magic was lost. And teamed with Hugh Grant? Bad move. Personally, I'm looking forward to the sequel, not due out until next year mind you. Not quite sure what the sequel could be about. The ending of this doesn't exactly scream out ""Make a sequel to me!"" now does it?I'll always love this movie. Hell, I'll love anything, even if it's bad, that's about an ugly duckling turning into a swan (Never Been Kissed, She's All That, and a few more). The transformation from unkempt Gracie, to HOT Gracie leaves you wanting that team working on you! (Although, her eyebrows were a bit OTT and very much fake) And also, teaming Sandy up with the lovely Benjamin Bratt was fabulous!THe extras on this DVD are pretty much average. You've got your obligatory (hehe) trailer, and behind the scenes features, which also show one or two deleted scenes! (I hate it when they do that) But of the one commentary I've watched of a movie, this one is the best. Sandy & Marc just seem to laugh right the way through it. (Unlike some commentaries, that just brag about how brilliant the cast/scenery/extras/location/ducks/blade of grass are) And when you re-watch the film, you'll remember certain parts of the commentary (I always remember Sandy saying about Frank Tobain's little dance, when they all walk out on stage for the first part of the beauty pageant)The soundtrack is also terrific (I own it). There's some terrific songs, including the most memorable scene, whilst ""Mustang Sally"" plays. Directly after the make-over scene, when Gracie first emerges as Hot Gracie, and everyone gets to see her for the first time, she wears a dress. Made entirely of rubber bands., Gracie emerges while ""Mustang Sally"" plays loudly. Wearing a dress that is made entirely out of rubber bands. When she held the ""gown"", it could fit in the palm of her hand. It also looks like she's pretty much poured into it! (The lucky thing)This movie is terrific. It does normally upset me. The girl changes her whole image and gets the guy, so it could be seen in a very sexist way, that the guy (in this case, Benjamin Bratt) changes her.

I enjoyed watching the film, but didn't laugh as much as I would have expected.  Sandra Bullock is a competent actress, smart enough to know what she does well and what her fan base wants from her.  Going from the rather unfeminine workaholic nerd to the potentially sophisticated beauty, Bullock works her part heartily and seems to be having a good time.  The fellow pageant hopefuls are fun at times, but Cheryl's stupidity (When William Shatner asks her about her ideal ""perfect date,"" she comes up with something like ""April 21."") is sometimes too broad.

She dresses like a slob, has a punching bag hanging in her apartment, doesn't wear makeup, clearly hasn't run a comb through her hair in years and, despite her name, lacks any discernable element of grace. She's the epitome of a tomboy. But Gracie is the best candidate the FBI can scrape up when they need an agent to go undercover in the Miss USA Pageant, which they fear may be the next target of a terrorist they are trying to track down. But there is one problem: They only have three days to transform this estrogen-deprived enigma into beauty pageant material. And of course, once they've done that, they still have to save the pageant and catch the bad guy.This is definitely one of the better comedies produced in the last few years, and provides non-stop laughs. Sandra Bullock, who also produced the film, is at her comedic best. She really pours herself into the role and lets herself go, providing both verbal and physical comedy. And, despite the humor, Gracie Hart still feels like a real person that we can empathize with. The supporting cast is also great, including Benjamin Bratt as Gracie's fellow FBI agent Eric Matthews, Michael Caine as pageant consultant Victor Melling, Candice Bergen as pageant director Kathy Morningside, William Shatner as announcer Stan Fields, and Heather Burns as fellow contestant Miss Rhode Island.Though ""chick flick"" is certainly the category this movie would fall under, ""Miss Congeniality"" has the potential to appeal to a wider audience. I saw this film twice in theaters, first with my father and then with a group of friends that included a guy. Both enjoyed it just as much as I did, and judging by the number of positive reviews here from male viewers, they are not alone. And heck, even if the plotline and comedy element aren't enough to keep the guys interested, there are always 50 gorgeous women to hold their attention! This is the Miss USA Pageant, after all.The DVD as a whole is slightly less impressive. Bonus Features include cast and crew filmographies, one feature-length commentary with Sandra Bullock and co-screenwriter Marc Lawrence, and another with director Donald Petrie, two behind-the-scenes featurettes entitled ""Preparing for the Pageant"" and ""The Pageant,"" both including some deleted scenes (all of which were much better left out of the film itself), and the theatrical trailer. Nothing terribly noteworthy, though the featurettes are somewhat interesting, albeit short. I was also a little disappointed to find that the DVD is packaged in the cardboard ""snap case"" style, rather than the more sturdy and durable plastic cases. But, packaging issues aside, ""Miss Congeniality"" is a great movie that I'd recommend to anyone.",5,"""She's beauty and she's grace..."" or is she?",1105142400,"01 8, 2005",2005,2790,"['FBI', 'agent', 'Gracie', 'Hart', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', ""n't"", 'have', 'feminine', 'bone', 'body', 'slob', 'punching', 'bag', 'hanging', 'apartment', ""n't"", 'wear', 'makeup', 'clearly', ""n't"", 'run', 'comb', 'hair', 'years', 'name', 'discernable', 'element', 'grace', 'epitome', 'tomboy', 'Gracie', 'best', 'candidate', 'FBI', 'can', 'scrape', 'up', 'when', 'need', 'agent', 'go', 'undercover', 'Miss', 'USA', 'Pageant', 'fear', 'may', 'be', 'next', 'target', 'terrorist', 'are', 'trying', 'track', 'down', 'one', 'problem', 'only', 'have', 'three', 'days', 'transform', 'estrogen-deprived', 'enigma', 'beauty', 'pageant', 'material', 'course', 'once', ""'ve"", 'done', 'still', 'have', 'save', 'pageant', 'catch', 'bad', 'guy.This', 'definitely', 'one', 'better', 'comedies', 'produced', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'non-stop', 'laughs', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'who', 'also', 'produced', 'film', 'comedic', 'best', 'really', 'pours', 'role', 'go', 'providing', 'verbal', 'physical', 'comedy', 'humor', 'Gracie', 'Hart', 'still', 'real', 'person', 'can', 'empathize', 'supporting', 'cast', 'also', 'great', 'including', 'Benjamin', 'Bratt', 'Gracie', 'fellow', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Eric', 'Matthews', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'pageant', 'consultant', 'Victor', 'Melling', 'Candice', 'Bergen', 'pageant', 'director', 'Kathy', 'Morningside', 'William', 'Shatner', 'announcer', 'Stan', 'Fields', 'Heather', 'Burns', 'fellow', 'contestant', 'Miss', 'Rhode', 'Island.Though', 'chick', 'flick', 'certainly', 'category', 'movie', 'would', 'fall', 'Miss', 'Congeniality', 'potential', 'appeal', 'wider', 'audience', 'saw', 'film', 'twice', 'theaters', 'first', 'father', 'then', 'group', 'friends', 'included', 'guy', 'enjoyed', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'judging', 'number', 'positive', 'reviews', 'here', 'male', 'viewers', 'are', 'not', 'alone', 'heck', 'even', 'plotline', 'comedy', 'element', 'are', ""n't"", 'enough', 'keep', 'guys', 'interested', 'are', 'always', '50', 'gorgeous', 'women', 'hold', 'attention', 'Miss', 'USA', 'Pageant', 'all.The', 'DVD', 'whole', 'slightly', 'less', 'impressive', 'Bonus', 'Features', 'include', 'cast', 'crew', 'filmographies', 'one', 'feature-length', 'commentary', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'co-screenwriter', 'Marc', 'Lawrence', 'director', 'Donald', 'Petrie', 'two', 'behind-the-scenes', 'featurettes', 'entitled', 'Preparing', 'Pageant', 'Pageant', 'including', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'were', 'much', 'better', 'left', 'film', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'Nothing', 'terribly', 'noteworthy', 'featurettes', 'are', 'somewhat', 'interesting', 'albeit', 'short', 'was', 'also', 'little', 'disappointed', 'find', 'DVD', 'packaged', 'cardboard', 'snap', 'case', 'style', 'rather', 'more', 'sturdy', 'durable', 'plastic', 'cases', 'packaging', 'issues', 'aside', 'Miss', 'Congeniality', 'great', 'movie', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'anyone']",N/A

If it sounds silly that's because it is and the subplot with the bad guys is merely perfunctory.  It's the hilarious skit on beauty pageants that really gives this movie its sparkle.It's fair to say that such things are easy to take off, but in parts this film is genuinely funny without having to resort to toilet or gross-out humour.  Of course Gracie finds out that these beauty pageant contestants are real people, not such airheads.  Yet there are some great supporting roles from the other girls (Michael Caine and Benjamin Bratt are just passable) that give the film that warm fuzzy and light feeling that appealed it to the watchers.More importantly, this gives Sandra Bullock another chance to break Hollywood again.

576627,A1TUDEC66M9FO3,B00005AAA9,Preston C. Enright,"[2, 15]","I agree with the reviewer, Steven Jones, and his comments about the grotesque violence of this film and how it's supposed to be cute.  It seems many citizens of the American empire have been  desensitized to violence by our depraved, corporate media.  So, a film with beatings and other violence here and there is considered part of a film that's ""fun for the whole family"" and a ""great escape.""  Escape from what. . . peace?  It makes one think of those scenes at Abu Ghraib, and how much fun Lindy England was  having while she beat on other human beings.Then there is the issue of beauty pagents.  People may want to read a book like ""Reviving Ophelia"" that analyzes the issue of ""lookism"" and the obsession with physical appearances.I wouldn't be surprised if this film received some funding from the gun industry.  They've been seeking to increase sales to the female market, and having Bullock parade around with a gun strapped to her thigh provides effective moments of ""guerrilla"" marketing.  The most effective advertising is advertising that isn't recognized as such.  Even if people didn't see this awful film, they saw the promos for it.  We often will find in the movie section of our newspapers some beautiful person posing with a gun.  As if Bullock's gun modelling wasn't enough, she has to have a line about how, ""This is Texas, everyone has guns,"" a classic sales line.  So, go get your guns everybody, you don't want to feel left out; and if you're lucky, maybe your gun will help to make you a beauty queen like Sandra.Maybe she's pretty on the outside, but this film is ugly throughout.For alternative views, or for an ""escape"" from this sort of mainpulative trash, I'd recommend Ms. Magazine over Ms. Congeniality.  And for another source on how to boost female self-esteem in more profound ways than dressing them up like a sex fantasy of a Smith and Wesson executive, I'd recommend ""Teen Voices"" and ""New Moon: A Magazine for Girls and Their Dreams.""One last comment, this film also provides good public relations for the FBI.  We should keep in mind that organization's history of anti-democractic behavior.  See, for instance, the book ""COINTELPRO"" by Ward Churchill.  There are all sorts of manipulative info operations going on in this country.

576628,A3MCQSIBV7QW8Q,B00005AAA9,Priscilla Stafford,"[3, 6]","Finally had a chance to rent &quot;Miss Congeniality&quot;. I found it extremely funny and entertaining, though as some people have pointed out the plot is nothing spectacular.When FBI Agent Gracie Hart (Sandra Bullock) bungles an assignment leading to the injury of another agent, she feels herself incapable of doing anything. But soon afterwards she is assigned by friend and fellow agent, Eric Matthews (Benjamin Bratt) as an undercover agent. To go as Miss New Jersey in the Miss United States Pageant in San Antonio, Texas! Unfortunately for them, though Gracie is the only one able to go, she absolutely hates to wear make-up, wear a dress, and meet all the requirements of becoming a contestant in a beauty pageant. Even with the help of the famous Victor Melling (Michael Caine), will they be able pull off changing Gracie into a lady? Also starring; Candice Bergen as Kathy Morningside, William Shatner as Stan Fields, and Heather Burns as Miss Rhode Island/Cheryl Frasier.Sandra Bullock is exceptionally good, playing the part of Gracie Hart, FBI agent. She is incredibly good, her humor is given off to perfection. From the way she walks, talks, and snort/laughs, I just died laughing! Benjamin Bratt is great as another FBI agent and the chemistry between him and Sandra Bullock was well-acted. Their bantering is so fun to watch. Michael Caine should also be mentioned since he is wonderful as Gracie's 'trainer'. One small disappointment in the acting was of William Shatner. I have always loved him as the commander on the USS Enterprise of the Star Trek series but seeing him as a sort of stupid announcer was a bit sad to watch. Though he was acting well, it's just that I wished they should have at least given him a better part.As I said, &quot;Miss Congeniality&quot; is incredibly funny, filled with one-liners and favorite scenes you would love. A few of my favorite lines and parts are: 1) When the agents use a 'Dress up Sally' program to dress up agents on the computer. 2) The gym scene where Gracie Hart and Eric Matthew go head-to-head. 3) Gracie Hart being 'transformed'. 4) When Gracie takes off all her concealed weapons. 5) When Gracie says about Eric, &quot;I knew he had an incurable disease, I just hadn't realized till now it was stupidity.&quot; 6) I love it when Sandra Bullock says to Eric, &quot;You think I'm gorgeous... You want to kiss me... You want to hug me... You want to love me... You want to smooch me... You want to hug me.&quot; I thought that that was very cute and the way she says it is so funny!And lots, lots more!&quot;Miss Congeniality&quot; is rated PG-13 for some language and also for innuendos. In actuality, I would give this movie 3 and 1/2 stars for these reasons because at some points I felt they could have skipped some parts. But a very enjoyable movie to watch though as I said the plot is nothing spectacular.

""Miss Congeniality""  is a little whispy and predictable, and while generally enjoyable enough never reaches the heights of zaniness it might have aspired to.  Without Sandy, it would be a dull and cheerless thing indeed, despite workmanlike performances by Candace Bergen, Michael Caine, and the old hamasaurus himself, William Shatner.  Fortunately, the irrepressible  Miss Bullock's considerable comedic talents raise the script beyond itself.  But the true gem in the DVD version is the alternate audio track with running commentary from Bullock and one of the screenwriters -- this is very entertaining and revealing and is frequently much funnier than the movie itself.  Add an extra half-star to the DVD version for this feature alone.Sidebar Note: my wife and I worked for two miserable days as ""background actors"" (extras) on this movie, which was largely shot in Austin in the spring of 2000.

This is one of those movies that the more you think about it, the less you will enjoy it.  But if you cut it a lot of slack and don't worry about the gaps, it will be fun.I mean, how seriously can you take a film where you take an FBI agent and insert her into a beauty pageant, especially one where they replace Miss New Jersey with someone who never participated in the Miss New Jersey pageant?  Wouldn't the first runner up complain?  Not to mention second runner up, and third runner up, and so forth.  Start asking question like this and the film starts falling apart.The miracle of this film is that it is a lot of fun despite a lot of bad things you can say about it.  For instance, Sandra Bullock somehow manages to be adorable despite many horrible moments of acting.  Much, much too much of her performance consists of acting that is way, way too broad and borderline slapstick.  Anyone doubting me should rewatch the film.  Note the snorting when she laughs.  Or the way she overacts in watching tapes of previous beauty pageants when on the private plane that is carrying her to her makeover.  Some actors and actresses have personalities that manage to shine even when doing a poor job, and that is true of Sandra in this one.  Subjectively, she is adorable and loveable, but objectively, she does a really bad job in this one.  And what a waste of talent having Michael Caine as a beauty pageant consultant!  He is incapable of doing a bad job, but it is hard to believe that this was the best script that was laid before him at this particular moment in his career.  Anyone who has seen his recent and stunning Oscar-nominated performance in THE QUIET AMERICAN will doubt that he remains one of the most gifted and professional actors in the world.  But what is he doing in this film?Anyone wanting to dislike this film will.  Anyone willing to cut it a few miles of slack will enjoy it.  That may sound paradoxical, but it is also true.

The introductory scenes are populated with the cop movie usual suspects: the screw up with the angry superior to pull her off the beat and the donut jokes.  The pagent officials roll their eyes and toss barbed,unveiled insults at Bullock at the idea of her crashing the Pagent. The &quot;idiot plot&quot; device is that officials would not only let her in, but agree to make her a finalist so that she could have access to all areas of the pageant during the show. Of course no one considers the less complicated suggestion that giving an undercover officer blanket access would have the same effect. But then you don't get to have Sandy on stage and that would spoil the whole party. Once acclimatized to the silly setup, the remaining hour plays out in an unoffensive amusing fashion with nothing much to praise or condemn.  The big surprise for me is the hilarious commentary between Bullock and co-screenwriter Marc Lawrence on the bonus portion of the DVD. My intent is not to insult the movie when I say that the commentary is much funnier and more charming than anything the move had to offer.  It simply is. Its obvious Mark and Sandra have great chemistry together as they power through the entire film, making fun of each other's writing and acting ability and moments in the film itself in good old fashioned Mystery Science Theater style.  They are spontaneous, witty, and truly charming.  All the qualities you hope to find in a Sandra Bullock film.  I can't really recommend the film unless you have nothing else to watch. But I can recommend the DVD because of this fun and unique style of commentary.  If you rent it, be sure to turn it on. And if you only have time to watch the film once. Watch it this way instead.

To say that what passes for dialogue between these two characters - essentially a barrage of crude, uninspired insults - falls far short of Shavian wit would indeed be a massive understatement.  One of the biggest problems with the film is that Bullock, in an attempt to appear unpleasant and abrasive, manages to obscure the one quality that has sustained her in most of her previous films - her innate sweetness and charm.  Unfortunately, we neither believe nor like her in this role - and without that crucial element of audience identification, the entire comedy falls to pieces.  We simply don't accept her for a second as the uncouth slob she is attempting to portray.  We know she is just ""playing"" at being dowdy and crude so that she can be transformed, Cinderella-like, into a lady in time for the ball.  Her prince, a fellow FBI agent played by Benjamin Bratt, starts off as a bland foil only to turn into an even blander romantic love interest.  Only Candice Bergen as the pageant's director and William Shatner as the show's emcee seem to have the slightest clue that they are even in a comedy at all.  Considering the fact that there is really only one laugh-out-loud moment in the whole movie (Bullock's attempt to tackle a supposed suspect), they might be mistaken after all.If you want to see a GOOD modern version of ""Pygmalion,"" (also starring Michael Caine in the Higgins role), check out 1983's delightful ""Educating Rita"" and skip ""Miss Congeniality.""",2,wan comedy,1000598400,"09 16, 2001",2001,2383,"['George', 'Bernard', 'Shaw', 'classic', 'play', 'Pygmalion', 'probably', 'inspired', 'more', 'movie', 'plots', 'theatrical', 'work', 'can', 'think', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'one', 'be', 'caliber', 'My', 'Fair', 'Lady', 'still', 'how', 'such', 'profoundly', 'clever', 'witty', 'source', 'work', 'can', 'result', 'so', 'many', 'lowbrow', 'humorless', 'imitations.The', 'latest', 'such', 'fiasco', 'Miss', 'Congeniality', 'alleged', 'comedy', 'starring', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'tomboyish', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'FBI', 'agent', 'who', 'sent', 'undercover', 'contestant', 'help', 'nab', 'killer', 'threatening', 'target', 'Miss', 'United', 'States', 'Beauty', 'Pageant', 'Ms.', 'Bullock', 'Eliza', 'Doolittle', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Professor', 'Henry', 'Higgins', 'case', 'snooty', 'effete', 'groomer', 'prospective', 'contestants', 'job', 'pass', 'less-than-ladylike', 'Ms.', 'Bullock', 'off', 'viable', 'candidate', 'Shaw', 'was', 'nothing', 'else', 'was', 'brilliant', 'writer', 'scintillating', 'dialogue', 'say', 'what', 'dialogue', 'two', 'characters', 'essentially', 'barrage', 'crude', 'uninspired', 'insults', 'far', 'short', 'Shavian', 'wit', 'would', 'indeed', 'be', 'massive', 'understatement', 'One', 'biggest', 'problems', 'film', 'Bullock', 'attempt', 'appear', 'unpleasant', 'abrasive', 'obscure', 'one', 'quality', 'sustained', 'most', 'previous', 'films', 'innate', 'sweetness', 'charm', 'Unfortunately', 'believe', 'role', 'crucial', 'element', 'audience', 'identification', 'entire', 'comedy', 'pieces', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'accept', 'second', 'uncouth', 'slob', 'attempting', 'portray', 'know', 'just', 'playing', 'being', 'dowdy', 'crude', 'so', 'can', 'be', 'transformed', 'Cinderella-like', 'lady', 'time', 'ball', 'prince', 'fellow', 'FBI', 'agent', 'played', 'Benjamin', 'Bratt', 'off', 'bland', 'foil', 'only', 'turn', 'even', 'blander', 'romantic', 'love', 'interest', 'Only', 'Candice', 'Bergen', 'pageant', 'director', 'William', 'Shatner', 'show', 'emcee', 'seem', 'have', 'slightest', 'clue', 'are', 'even', 'comedy', 'Considering', 'fact', 'really', 'only', 'one', 'laugh-out-loud', 'moment', 'whole', 'movie', 'Bullock', 'attempt', 'tackle', 'supposed', 'suspect', 'might', 'be', 'mistaken', 'all.If', 'want', 'see', 'GOOD', 'modern', 'version', 'Pygmalion', 'also', 'starring', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Higgins', 'role', 'check', '1983', 'delightful', 'Educating', 'Rita', 'skip', 'Miss', 'Congeniality']",N/A

576650,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B00005AAA9,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[1, 1]","I had to watch this flick again.  Though it has one of those simple plots that must take about ten seconds to pitch, winning performances from just about everybody elevate this flick.  Sandra Bullock plays a frumpy and unloved Fed.  The script is actually paradoxical on this point - she's strong willed and can hold her self against any man, she's weak when it comes to being a woman.  Wearing unisex clothing, loping about like something out of ""Jurassic Park"" (Michael Caine's line), and accompanying her laugh with a distinctive snort, Grace Hart isn't anybody's idea of the perfect woman.  Brainy, Hart decodes the latest message from a mysterious domestic terrorist patterned on the ""Uni-Bomber"", and decides that the next target will be the Miss USA pageant, only days away.  Unable to come up with an idea other than substitute a contestant with an agent, and lacking any suitable agents (who aren't on maternity leave) Hart is chosen to step in as Ms. NJ.  (The real NJ contestant consented to step down when the Feds discovered her role in a movie called ""Arm-a-Get-it-On"").  With the help of a disgraced pageant coach (Michael Caine) and a crew of top-notch technicians working out of some remote airfield (Hangar 18?), Grace Hart is transformed into the glam Gracie Lou Freebush.  The joke is that beauty is only skin deep and it's always Grace Hart on the inside, the same Gracie that dismisses the pageant and its contestants as airheads who can't think of anything more to say than that they wish for world peace.  The script doesn't spend that much time elevating the contestants themselves who are either backstabbers or just dim, but Michael Caine excels as the demented Victor Melling who teaches women how to look desirable even as he has no desire for them.  Also look for Bill Shatner as the pageant's over-the-hill MC, the man who can smile through anything, and Ben Bratt as Bullock's chauvanist partner.  This was an idea done to death decades ago on countless network shows (Bionic Woman, Wonder Woman, Charlie's Angels) but it works here.",4,More fun than it has the right to be,1021334400,"05 14, 2002",2002,2065,"['had', 'watch', 'flick', 'again', 'one', 'simple', 'plots', 'must', 'take', 'ten', 'seconds', 'pitch', 'winning', 'performances', 'just', 'everybody', 'elevate', 'flick', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'frumpy', 'unloved', 'Fed', 'script', 'actually', 'paradoxical', 'point', 'strong', 'willed', 'can', 'hold', 'self', 'man', 'weak', 'when', 'being', 'woman', 'Wearing', 'unisex', 'clothing', 'loping', 'something', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'line', 'accompanying', 'laugh', 'distinctive', 'snort', 'Grace', 'Hart', ""n't"", 'anybody', 'idea', 'perfect', 'woman', 'Brainy', 'Hart', 'latest', 'message', 'mysterious', 'domestic', 'terrorist', 'patterned', 'Uni-Bomber', 'next', 'target', 'will', 'be', 'Miss', 'USA', 'pageant', 'only', 'days', 'away', 'Unable', 'come', 'up', 'idea', 'other', 'substitute', 'contestant', 'agent', 'lacking', 'suitable', 'agents', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'maternity', 'leave', 'Hart', 'chosen', 'step', 'Ms.', 'NJ', 'real', 'NJ', 'contestant', 'consented', 'step', 'down', 'when', 'Feds', 'discovered', 'role', 'movie', 'called', 'Arm-a-Get-it-On', 'help', 'disgraced', 'pageant', 'coach', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'crew', 'top-notch', 'technicians', 'working', 'remote', 'airfield', 'Hangar', '18', 'Grace', 'Hart', 'transformed', 'glam', 'Gracie', 'Lou', 'Freebush', 'joke', 'beauty', 'only', 'skin', 'deep', 'always', 'Grace', 'Hart', 'inside', 'same', 'Gracie', 'pageant', 'contestants', 'airheads', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'anything', 'more', 'say', 'wish', 'world', 'peace', 'script', ""n't"", 'spend', 'much', 'time', 'elevating', 'contestants', 'who', 'are', 'backstabbers', 'just', 'dim', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'excels', 'demented', 'Victor', 'Melling', 'who', 'women', 'how', 'look', 'desirable', 'even', 'desire', 'Also', 'look', 'Bill', 'Shatner', 'pageant', 'over-the-hill', 'MC', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'smile', 'anything', 'Ben', 'Bratt', 'Bullock', 'chauvanist', 'partner', 'was', 'idea', 'done', 'death', 'decades', 'ago', 'countless', 'network', 'shows', 'Bionic', 'Woman', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'Charlie', 'Angels', 'here']",N/A

In her own words, ""I don't own a dress, I don't even own a brush"".  Yet when a letter comes from a serial criminal calling himself The Citizen, threatening the Miss United States pageant, FBI Agent Eric Matthews (Benjamin Bratt) must find an undercover female field agent under thirty-five who looks good in a bikini and isn't on Maternity Leave.  His only choice boils down to Hart, who's violently reluctant to take the assignment.  She becomes Miss New Jersey, the FBI finding out and ready to expose the original winner because of her appearance in an ""adult film"".They notify the pageant director Kathy Morningside (Candice Bergan) and pageant Master Of Ceremonies Stan Fields (William Shatner) to assist them in fixing the pageant so that undercover Gracie makes it into the top 5.  But Gracie needs a lot of polish before taking on the assignment.  Kathy Morningside puts Matthews and Hart in touch with Victor Melling (the amazing Michael Caine) who is a long time, respected pageant consultant.  Victor has only 24 hours to make tomboy Gracie into a beauty queen.  Miraculously, Victor accomplishes his task, muttering to himself, ""My God, I'm good!"".Once undercover, Gracie discovers that both Stan Fields and Kathy Morningside have been fired, the pageant wanting to cater to a younger audience and use younger public figures.  When the DNA evidence suggests a woman licked the Citizen's envelope, Gracie suspects Kathy Morningside.  But the Citizen is caught halfway through the pageant, and FBI director MacDonald (Ernie Hudson) wants to pull all the agents off the case.  Grace refuses, knowing deep down that something is wrong and the girls are in danger.  She continues alone, without her badge and gun, to capture whoever it is threatening the girls; who've gotten underneath her tough exterior and become her friends.The cast of 'Miss Congeniality' is what makes the movie such a success.  Bullock and Caine work well together, each delivering superb performances.  The humor is light and frequent, so the show keeps you laughing all the way through.  This is one of my favorite comedies, being a hardcore Sandra Bullock fan.  It's very difficult to make Sandra Bullock ""ugly"", and the decision to go with ""tomboy"" instead worked very well.  ""Where am I going to put my gun?"" Gracie asks, after finally accepting the assignment, and being told she HAS to wear the bathing suit.  ""Nowhere I want to know about,"" answers Matthews.A little piece of trivia from the IMDB database:  the dress that Sandra Bullock wore when she's coming out of the hanger was made out of rubber bands; when it was off, the whole dress fit in the palm of her hand.  Sexy!  This is a hilariously funny movie with a sweet touch of innocence, yet it manages not to become saccharine.  It's a great pick-me-up if you're feeling blue.  Even though I'm a horror movie buff, you have to cater to your lighter side every so often.  I highly recommend this movie; it's definitely worth a purchase.

It's silly from start to finish. Just a little bit less of the silliness would have made for a better movie.

Gracie, a tomboy, having botched her most recent case for the FBI, is forced to go undercover at a beauty pageant contestant or risk losing her job.Gracie, a shaggy haired, (sorry, I seriously doubt the FBI would allow you to wear your hair down and unbrushed, umm, hello? Dress Code?) is a men's-clothing wearing nerd, and is also the most clumsy woman in the FBI . She  seems destined for fail her new assignment until she falls into the hands of Victor Melling(Michael Caine),  Beauty pageant contestant consultant. With Melling's help, Gracie manages to beautify herself and learn to compete, thus proving to herself and others, she 'has what it takes' to be Miss America.I found Miss Congeniality to be a entertaining, funny light drama, despite its obvious message: &quot;You must be beautiful to be someone.&quot; I disliked the fact that her male co-worker was only interested in her AFTER she had her makeover. (How shallow is that, and what kind of message does that send?) Despite this obvious misogynistic overtones, I really did  liked this flick.

This is my favorite movie starring Sandra Bullock.  FBI agent Gracie Hart is going undercover as a contestant in the Miss United States contest.  She has to actually do girlie things.  I mean Gracie wearing make up, and acting demure?  Not this tomboy!!!  She becomes Gracie Lu Freebush to find a bomber who threatens the pageant.  The scene where Eric (the handsome Benjamin Bratt) has to convince Gracie she is perfect for the assignment, and they fight is hilarious!!!  Especially when she has her legs around his head, and he is trying to speak.  Gracie was not the first choice, but the other agents are either to homely looking or on maternity leave.  Convincing the pageant's Director that Gracie has to not only compete in the pageant, but place fifth is no easy task.  After much reluctance, Gracie is allowed in, but it's obvious Gracie needs some serious fine tuning.  Victor Melling is a pageant consultant, but one look at Gracie and he thinks he can't do anything to help her.  He can't stand the way she eats, the way she speaks and her tomboyish manner.  He changes his mind and gives it a go.  He brings in a team that would make Extreme Make over look like play time.  Gracie is transformed from an ugly duckling to a beautiful swan. One of my favorite scenes is when she has all the foil on her head and she says ""With all this tin foil on my head, I can probably get HBO."" Sanda Bullock is so beautiful, but she plays frumpy quite well.  Another really funny moment was how she ate the steak.  I laughed, but cringed at the same time.  So unlady like, but she did not care.  She would eat and talk.What I liked about the film is Gracie is forced to look within herself.  When she is down, she eats a pint of Ben and Jerry's ice cream.  Her defense mechanism against her own fears is to be sarcastic.  She is clumsy, but she shows a human side that you can't help but connect with her character.  You can relate to her to a degree.  When Gracie is surrounded by her fellow contestants that's when the fun really starts.The reason this movie is so funny is it has a slapstick appeal.  I've enjoyed slap stick comedy since John Ritter (RIP) on Three's Company.  Sandra did it well.The other female contestants in the movie were also funny.  Gracie's jumping off stage to tackle a guy with a gun is hilarious.  The romance between Gracie and Eric was really cute. ""You want to kiss me, you want to kiss me, and love me.""  Their chemistry was great.  This is a must watch movie for sure.

George ""anne-with-an-e""","[1, 2]","As I fell on some ice this morning, just as my bruises were healing from falling over a curb last week, I thought it was time to review my favorite clumsy heroine...Gracy Hart, aka Miss Congeniality.In this film, Gracie Hart (Sandra Bullock) is an FBI agent who has to go undercover as a contestant in the Miss United States pageant.  The only problem was that she is the biggest tomboy there ever was - clumsy, uncouth, unsociable with a corny sense of humor.  Would they ever be able to clean her up in time to make her a believable top 10 contestant?  Kathy Morningside (Candice Bergen), the pageant manager and former beauty queen, certainly doesn't think so.But, of course, the reality is that they can.  No one is surprised that Sandra Bullock turns out to be a bombshell (even if you didn't see the previews).  Thus, the ""magic make-over"" theme in the movie is as old and predictable as Cinderella herself.However, in my mind, the noted shortcomings of the movie were overshadowed by one thing: the fact that this movie took on the beauty pageants!  Whether you love 'em or hate 'em, beauty pageants are an American cultural phenomena - like Nascar, WWF, Gladiators, and American Idol.  It has a following, some people take it very seriously, and some people mock it.And what better way to take on our infamous beauty pageants than to have an intelligent and uncouth tomboy be forced to enter into one?  The genius of the film is in the absolutely hilarious timing and ironic circumstances.  The chemistry with Bullock and Michael Caine (as her gay coach, Victor Melling) was perfection throughout the film.  Gracie's jumping off stage like a flying squirrel to tackle a guy with a gun is precious.  The riotous finale had me in tears, it was so funny.Additionally, the casting was excellent.  The one neutral player to me was Benjamin Bratt playing Eric Matthews.  He wasn't bad, but I don't know that he added anywhere near as much as Bergen, Caine and William Shatner.  And for those of you who participate in or are fans of beauty pageants, don't worry.  Ultimately, the movie redeems rather than trash them.4 stars for anyone looking for a light flick with good comedic timing.",4,"Love 'Em or Hate 'Em, It's About the Beauty Pageants",1077148800,"02 19, 2004",2004,2189,"['fell', 'ice', 'morning', 'just', 'bruises', 'were', 'healing', 'falling', 'over', 'curb', 'last', 'week', 'thought', 'was', 'time', 'review', 'favorite', 'clumsy', 'heroine', 'Gracy', 'Hart', 'Miss', 'Congeniality.In', 'film', 'Gracie', 'Hart', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'FBI', 'agent', 'who', 'go', 'undercover', 'contestant', 'Miss', 'United', 'States', 'pageant', 'only', 'problem', 'was', 'biggest', 'tomboy', 'there', 'ever', 'was', 'clumsy', 'uncouth', 'unsociable', 'corny', 'sense', 'humor', 'Would', 'ever', 'be', 'able', 'clean', 'up', 'time', 'make', 'believable', 'top', '10', 'contestant', 'Kathy', 'Morningside', 'Candice', 'Bergen', 'pageant', 'manager', 'former', 'beauty', 'queen', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'think', 'so.But', 'course', 'reality', 'can', 'one', 'surprised', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'out', 'be', 'bombshell', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'previews', 'Thus', 'magic', 'make-over', 'theme', 'movie', 'old', 'predictable', 'Cinderella', 'herself.However', 'mind', 'noted', 'shortcomings', 'movie', 'were', 'overshadowed', 'one', 'thing', 'fact', 'movie', 'took', 'beauty', 'pageants', 'Whether', 'love', 'hate', 'beauty', 'pageants', 'are', 'American', 'cultural', 'phenomena', 'Nascar', 'WWF', 'Gladiators', 'American', 'Idol', 'following', 'people', 'take', 'very', 'seriously', 'people', 'mock', 'it.And', 'what', 'better', 'way', 'take', 'infamous', 'beauty', 'pageants', 'have', 'intelligent', 'uncouth', 'tomboy', 'be', 'forced', 'enter', 'one', 'genius', 'film', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'timing', 'ironic', 'circumstances', 'chemistry', 'Bullock', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'gay', 'coach', 'Victor', 'Melling', 'was', 'perfection', 'film', 'Gracie', 'jumping', 'off', 'stage', 'flying', 'squirrel', 'tackle', 'guy', 'gun', 'precious', 'riotous', 'finale', 'had', 'tears', 'was', 'so', 'funny.Additionally', 'casting', 'was', 'excellent', 'one', 'neutral', 'player', 'was', 'Benjamin', 'Bratt', 'playing', 'Eric', 'Matthews', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'added', 'anywhere', 'as', 'much', 'Bergen', 'Caine', 'William', 'Shatner', 'who', 'participate', 'are', 'fans', 'beauty', 'pageants', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'Ultimately', 'movie', 'rather', 'trash', 'them.4', 'stars', 'anyone', 'looking', 'light', 'flick', 'good', 'comedic', 'timing']",N/A

As we were thinking that she might be living a gloomy acting life, she surprised us and rocked us with this hilarious and witty Miss Congeniality!The story was a very basic and sometimes headless one, but it managed to incorporate stuff that were important to make the storyline move on tightly and in an interesting manner. Gags were manipulated very cautiously and they could really ring the bell when needed. The cast was very good, this not only applied to Sandra, Michael and Benjamin, but also to all the girls in the pageant or &quot;the scholarship program&quot; as it was put in the movie.Sandra Bullock led the whole show basically, but without all the sparks with Michael Caine, the movie would be much less funny. Sandra Bullock tried hard to destroy her image of &quot;the girl next door&quot; and it was very successful. Her ruthless speeches and her crappy manner all came so naturally that you could see a brand new Sandra before you. Before that, we would not be able to imagine that Sandra Bullock could be so sloppy and &quot;masculine&quot;. Nontheless, we could still see the dashling Sandra for she was the undercover in the Miss USA pageant! But watching a well imaged and dressed up Sandra behaving like a man was even funnier. In all, you wouldn't be disappointed no matter you are a fan of Sandra Bullock or not.Michael Caine was as usual good. He was the next most important character in the movie and you can see that he really played his role with the exact amount of precision.

She's got that very special something which makes you instantly like her. She relies heavily on that during &quot;Miss Congeniality&quot;.Co-Produced by Sandra Bullock, this film certainly has its moments. It just doesn't have enough of them.We are presented with an FBI agent ( Bullock ) who is to go undercover at a Beauty Pagent. That's pretty much the extent of the jokes, made slightly more humorous due to the fact that they've taken pains to downplay the fact that Sandra Bullock is such an attractive woman. It's her &quot;transformation&quot; that's amusing and, unfortunately, not explored to a deeper extent.Along for the ride are a very funny Michael Caine as a &quot;pagent consultant&quot; and a perfectly wonderful Candice Bergen. They both are talented comedic actors.This film is a little too cute for me. It's got some genuine laughs, but they just don't come frequent enough for this to be a real laugh-out-loud comedy.I do however, recommend this DVD !And here is why .... simply listen to the commentary by Sandra Bullock ( always refered to as &quot;Sandy&quot; ) and screen writer Marc Lawrence. This commentary is funnier than the entire movie. It truly shows off the sense of humor that Sandra Bullock has. She's self-effacing, she points out plot problems and has a particular obsession with her own eyebrows ! It's very funny stuff.Just a quick note - Sandra Bullock refers to the &quot;deleted scenes&quot; in the commentary and you won't find them on the Special Features Menu of the DVD - they're actually at the end of the two documentaries featured. There are different scenes at the end of each of the two documentaries ( a neat little feature known as a &quot;DVD Easter Egg&quot; - basically hidden features in DVD's ).Best Regards, turtlex",4,Worth The Purchase Price for the Commentary by Bullock,994723200,"07 10, 2001",2001,1892,"['FYI', 'Contains', 'DVD', 'Easter', 'Egg', 'Info', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'very', 'charming', 'charismatic', 'engaging', 'actress', 'got', 'very', 'special', 'something', 'instantly', 'heavily', 'quot', 'Miss', 'Congeniality', 'quot', '.Co-Produced', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'film', 'certainly', 'moments', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'them.We', 'are', 'presented', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Bullock', 'who', 'go', 'undercover', 'Beauty', 'Pagent', 'pretty', 'much', 'extent', 'jokes', 'made', 'slightly', 'more', 'humorous', 'due', 'fact', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'pains', 'downplay', 'fact', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'such', 'attractive', 'woman', 'quot', 'transformation', 'quot', 'amusing', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'explored', 'deeper', 'extent.Along', 'ride', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'quot', 'pagent', 'consultant', 'quot', 'perfectly', 'wonderful', 'Candice', 'Bergen', 'are', 'talented', 'comedic', 'actors.This', 'film', 'little', 'too', 'cute', 'got', 'genuine', 'laughs', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'frequent', 'enough', 'be', 'real', 'laugh-out-loud', 'comedy.I', 'do', 'however', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'here', 'why', 'simply', 'listen', 'commentary', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'always', 'refered', 'quot', 'Sandy', 'quot', 'screen', 'writer', 'Marc', 'Lawrence', 'commentary', 'funnier', 'entire', 'movie', 'truly', 'sense', 'humor', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'self-effacing', 'out', 'plot', 'problems', 'particular', 'obsession', 'own', 'eyebrows', 'very', 'funny', 'stuff.Just', 'quick', 'note', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'refers', 'quot', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'quot', 'commentary', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'Special', 'Features', 'Menu', 'DVD', ""'re"", 'actually', 'end', 'two', 'documentaries', 'featured', 'are', 'different', 'scenes', 'end', 'two', 'documentaries', 'neat', 'little', 'feature', 'known', 'quot', 'DVD', 'Easter', 'Egg', 'quot', 'basically', 'hidden', 'features', 'DVD', '.Best', 'Regards', 'turtlex']",N/A

I have found her characters likeable and watchable, and I haven't felt intellectually insulted by her movies (though I haven't seen Speed).I'll say right out that the cop-scenes in this movie were awful. For this movie to be a gem the actors needed to be more convincing as FBI agents. Go into this movie deciding to turn off your brain any time there are more than 3 agents on the screen. Again the opening FBI standoff was simply bad film-making.The composition of this movie is basically half Charlie's Angels (every episode: &quot;I have an idea, let's go undercover&quot;) and half Sister Act (&quot;I'll show these prudes how to party&quot;).It was a good decision to make the Pageant contestents privately smart and with their own sense of honor. That kept the film afloat. When Ms Rhode Island laments &quot;I went Rain Man&quot; it gave all the contestants a human depth.William Shatner delivered a great camp-performance, which is a compliment because that's what he was tasked to do.So this film is clearly camp and that is the two edge sword, since it's clearly not camp-enough. It's a bad decision to start out with real-world weapons and stake-out tactics, and then descend into camp.However, I found the film to be an enjoyable ha-ha diversion, so long as you're not looking for a terribly smart movie.
