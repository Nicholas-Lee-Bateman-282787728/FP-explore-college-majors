1669576,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00EVU3RGE,Andrew Ellington,"[5, 7]","Racism, terrorism, controversial societal conditions; these are all hot-button subjects and ones that get a lot of attention whether it be in the news, in social forums or in the movies.  Since 9/11, these have become even more common, and while not every film that revolves around terrorism stakes its home in the 9/11 tragedy, it&#8217;s safe to say that they owe the attention they receive to the social consciousness every living person took home from that event.A film like &#8216;The Attack&#8217; had a great opportunity to answer some questions that many unrelated to the issues at hand may have about the social environment in the Middle East.  With a strong core story that follows one man&#8217;s quest to uncover the truth about his wife&#8217;s involvement with a terrorist act, &#8216;The Attack&#8217; sets us up for what promises to be a very informative and engaging thrill ride.Sadly, the ball was dropped here.For me, &#8216;The Attack&#8217; suffers from too many unanswered questions and not enough clear character development.  When we get to the big reveal, everything feels so anticlimactic that we are left just as inquisitive and confused as we were in the beginning, even if our main protagonist acts as if all questions are answered.  It also fails at depicting a logical series of events, for the actions of the protagonist are never met with a reasonable end.  In other words, there is no way that he would have survived his abrasive inquiry of such a quiet and secretive faction and yet, he walks away with his answers, unscathed.  It makes very little sense, the way that this was mapped out, and it saddens me that the approach was more along the lines of a non-plausible Hollywood thriller as opposed to a direct and gritty look at real life scenarios.  What makes this approach all the more disappointing is that the pacing and dynamics of the film are of a more relaxed drama, and so the film winds up being slow AND unrealistic and so it just kind of becomes boring.I hate to sound all Debby Downer here, but the more I think of the this the more I&#8217;m baffled at how much potential was squandered here.On a positive note, Ali Suliman is VERY good here.  Despite having some pretty ridiculous character development, he handles the reality of his character&#8217;s grappling with his situation really well, and he sells it in its entirety.Like I said, the core story is a really rich one.  A successful man who is happily married finds himself questioning everything when his wife is not only killed in a terrorist bombing, but is being accused of being the terrorist herself.  It had so much opportunity to really flesh out the inner madness that the husband was experiencing (which is does, to an extent) and then show the counterbalance of what that truth really represented, but it feels so underwhelming that all context is lost and the impact is pretty much nonexistent.",3,Underwhelming look at terrorism in the Middle East&#8230;,1386201600,"12 5, 2013",2013,2916,"['Racism', 'terrorism', 'controversial', 'societal', 'conditions', 'are', 'hot-button', 'subjects', 'ones', 'get', 'lot', 'attention', 'be', 'news', 'social', 'forums', 'movies', '9/11', 'have', 'become', 'even', 'more', 'common', 'not', 'film', 'terrorism', 'home', '9/11', 'tragedy', '8217', 'safe', 'say', 'owe', 'attention', 'receive', 'social', 'consciousness', 'living', 'person', 'took', 'home', 'event.A', 'film', '8216', 'Attack', '8217', 'had', 'great', 'opportunity', 'answer', 'questions', 'many', 'unrelated', 'issues', 'hand', 'may', 'have', 'social', 'environment', 'Middle', 'East', 'strong', 'core', 'story', 'one', 'man', '8217', 'quest', 'uncover', 'truth', 'wife', '8217', 'involvement', 'terrorist', 'act', '8216', 'Attack', '8217', 'sets', 'up', 'what', 'be', 'very', 'informative', 'engaging', 'thrill', 'ride.Sadly', 'ball', 'was', 'dropped', '8216', 'Attack', '8217', 'suffers', 'too', 'many', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'not', 'enough', 'clear', 'character', 'development', 'When', 'get', 'big', 'reveal', 'everything', 'feels', 'so', 'anticlimactic', 'are', 'left', 'just', 'inquisitive', 'confused', 'were', 'beginning', 'even', 'main', 'protagonist', 'acts', 'questions', 'are', 'answered', 'also', 'depicting', 'logical', 'series', 'events', 'actions', 'protagonist', 'are', 'never', 'met', 'reasonable', 'end', 'other', 'words', 'way', 'would', 'have', 'survived', 'abrasive', 'inquiry', 'such', 'quiet', 'secretive', 'faction', 'yet', 'away', 'answers', 'unscathed', 'very', 'little', 'sense', 'way', 'was', 'mapped', 'out', 'approach', 'was', 'more', 'lines', 'non-plausible', 'Hollywood', 'thriller', 'opposed', 'direct', 'gritty', 'look', 'real', 'life', 'scenarios', 'What', 'approach', 'more', 'disappointing', 'pacing', 'dynamics', 'film', 'are', 'more', 'relaxed', 'drama', 'so', 'film', 'up', 'being', 'slow', 'AND', 'unrealistic', 'so', 'just', 'kind', 'becomes', 'boring.I', 'hate', 'sound', 'Debby', 'Downer', 'here', 'more', 'think', 'more', '8217', 'baffled', 'how', 'much', 'potential', 'was', 'squandered', 'positive', 'note', 'Ali', 'Suliman', 'VERY', 'good', 'here', 'having', 'pretty', 'ridiculous', 'character', 'development', 'reality', 'character', '8217', 'grappling', 'situation', 'really', 'well', 'entirety.Like', 'said', 'core', 'story', 'really', 'rich', 'one', 'successful', 'man', 'who', 'happily', 'married', 'questioning', 'everything', 'when', 'wife', 'not', 'only', 'killed', 'terrorist', 'bombing', 'being', 'accused', 'being', 'terrorist', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'opportunity', 'really', 'flesh', 'out', 'inner', 'madness', 'husband', 'was', 'experiencing', 'extent', 'then', 'show', 'counterbalance', 'what', 'truth', 'really', 'represented', 'so', 'underwhelming', 'context', 'lost', 'impact', 'pretty', 'much', 'nonexistent']",N/A

In the Torah, in Zephaniah 3:9 it states that God will turn to the people of the world a ""Pure Language"" in the latter days. This was said 610 years by God before He became Yeshuah ha Messiah in Bethlehem. He (God ) chose the name Jesus because ( that name had to be spoke in the English language which at that time didn't exist either ),  evil cannot tolerate the name of Jesus.Every time His most Holy Name is spoken if evil is around it (Evil) cannot hold itself still, because of the Power of that name Jesus..Then in that same verse God say's He wants us to all praise His Name, (Jesus) in that ""Pure Language"", all in accord and of like mindedness, so in order to do that, God inspired William Tyndale to translate all the collected scriptures from the original languages of Hebrew, Greek and Latin into his English version of scriptures which then in turn became the Alpha Bet, Dictionary and Lexicographical Syntax of the English Language, which in turn eventually became known as the King James Version Bible or England's Great Bible, then thus the English Language became known to the small island nation of England, better known as the British Islands. . As if this wasn't a great enough feat for God, He then inspired William Shakespeare to write his famous Prose literature , Poems, Sonnets and Plays for the template of this ""Pure Language"", and if that don't connote ""Perfection"" in a way that cannot be replicated, I don't know what would myself.All this killing in the name of an all knowing and Loving, Forgiving and compassionate God has to stop now... it's Satanic... and it must not be aided any longer by those of us who love God with all our hearts... pray to God so He will hear us out of all this craziness...

1669582,AYG1U47VFZ165,B00EVU3RGE,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[5, 5]","I tend to avoid watching most political dramas.  This isn&#8217;t to say that I don&#8217;t enjoy them; rather, because I&#8217;m already kinda/sorta set in my convictions and those convictions don&#8217;t tend to match up with an awful lot of Hollywood and/or mainstream releases that are political in nature, I honestly figure, &#8220;Why bother?&#8221;  I resent the typical Tinseltown indoctrination films &#8211; you know, the ones telling me how to think, to live, to pray (should I choose to).  I prefer living my life freely with my own code of morality, but I&#8217;ll occasionally get wrapped up in that rare film that appears to only use a politically-charged situation as a backdrop with which to explore human conflict.THE ATTACK &#8211; it&#8217;s apparently based on some relatively controversial international bestseller &#8211; is one such film.  Sure, it&#8217;s easy to see how some might be either offended or insulted by some of the themes wrapped up in here; but I was able to look past much of that into the eyes of a man (largely because of a gripping, stirring performance) tortured not only by what he had seen but also more so by what he hadn&#8217;t.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters.  If you&#8217;re the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I&#8217;d encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you&#8217;re accepting of a few modest hints at &#8216;things to come,&#8217; then read on &#8230;)Amin Jaafari (played with simmering intensity by Ali Suliman) is a physician in Israel.  Although he&#8217;s of Palestinian descent, he&#8217;s clearly embraced what life has to offer him and his wife Siham (a radiant Reymond Amsellem).  On the cusp of greatness, he&#8217;s being served an award for an exceptional career in medicine.  All of this world suddenly comes crashing down around him when a suicide bombing leaves nineteen dead, and the Israeli authorities suspect Siham as the guilty culprit.  Against the advice of his friends, Amin embarks on a journey to uncover her innocence, but what he finds waiting for him in an even greater secret that threatens his livelihood even more.It&#8217;s no wonder that the film has garnered so much praise.  It won Special Jury Mention at the 2012 San Sebastian International Film Festival, as well as playing to great acclaim at the 2012 Toronto, Mill Valley, and Telluride Film Festivals.  Also, it won Best Picture at the 2012 Marrakech Film Festival.  In 2013, it was nominated for the prestigious &#8220;New Blood&#8221; Award at the Cognac Festival du Film Policier.  THE ATTACK is one of those rare films which critics embrace and regular Joes &#8211; if they give it a chance &#8211; can appreciate.The adaptation penned by Joelle Touma and director Ziad Douieri deftly moves within the world struggling with both Israel and Palestinian influences.  As I&#8217;m not familiar with the original novel, I couldn&#8217;t say how well the motion picture compares to the book, but I can tell you that despite the subject matter&#8217;s obvious controversy I found ATTACK to remain fairly impartial to both sides politically.  This story didn&#8217;t seem all that obsessed with proving one right and another wrong.  It was a drama about a noble man with tragic and sometimes dire circumstances forced on him secretly.  Granted, someone with greater involvement or personal attachment to the situation in the Middle East may feel differently; instead, I found myself drawn closer and closer to Amin&#8217;s struggles, his quest to either prove his wife&#8217;s blamelessness or see his world torn apart by what he finds.In that respect, Suliman is a master of his craft.  We watch him move from the film&#8217;s opening &#8211; a humble physician trying to honor his profession as well as the wishes of those around him, even those who despise him for his heritage &#8211; into vastly deeper territory.  He endures the stages of grief, then denial, then a kind of blind acceptance of Siham&#8217;s possible culpability; and he uses all of these emotions to ultimately push him onto a path of privately investigating the bombing and his wife&#8217;s death from it.  At some point, he realizes that he isn&#8217;t seeking redemption for her any longer; tortured by each new revelation, he understands that, at this point, all that truly matters to him are answers &#8230; and answers is just what he gets.Come the conclusion, he&#8217;s no longer certain about anything, as is aptly demonstrated by the closing scenes.  One might say his journey is existentially &#8220;riches to rags&#8221; when the reality of his ignorance close in around him.THE ATTACK (2012) is produced by 3B Productions, Scope Pictures, Douri Films, Canal+, Cine+, and Random House Films.  DVD distribution is being handled by the Cohen Media Group.  For those needing it spelled out perfectly, this is an Arabic and Hebrew spoken language film with English subtitles (there is no English dubbing available).  As for the technical specifications, this is an impressively staged production with the highest quality sight and sound.  Lastly, if it&#8217;s special features you want, then you&#8217;re going to be left wanting as the disc only boasts a brief interview with director Ziad Doueiri, a photo gallery, and the theatrical trailer &#8211; not unusual, but it&#8217;s a shame these foreign releases don&#8217;t have more frills, especially when they&#8217;re this good.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  Sometimes the only alternative you have against a bad choice is an awful one, and that is a theme at work consistently throughout THE ATTACK.  A single suicide bombing kills far more than those destroyed in the blast; it undoes lives in more ways any person sees imaginable.  The film is highlighted by excellent performances by all of the players.In the interests of fairness, I&#8217;m pleased to disclose that the fine folks a Cohen Media Group provided me with a DVD copy of THE ATTACK by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",4,THE ATTACK Remains A Human Drama That Transcends Its Obvious Politics,1389139200,"01 8, 2014",2014,6160,"['tend',

Corbin ""Foster Corbin""","[2, 5]","""The Attack,"" directed by Ziad Doueiri and based on the novel of the same name by the brilliant writer Yasmina Khadra, is quite simply one of the  best movies I have seen  in several years. It is refreshing to know that writers and directors are still doing work that should not  be missed  by thoughtful movie-goers. It is one of those films that you simply have to take the recommendation of whoever reviews it pretty much on faith as too much information will spoil it for you.  The film is about a suicide  bombing in Tel Aviv  with a heartbreaking twist to  the plot that asks  exceedingly difficult questions  about the ongoing Israeli  and Palestinian conflict.  (I read that the film has been banned or refused release in every Arab country for the crime of having been filmed in Israel. That should tell you something about  just how controversial this movie is.)Ali Suliman as the Arab physician Amin Jaafari and Reymonde Amsellem who plays his wife Siham Jaafari turn in excellent performances; but the supporting actors are just as good as there is no lackluster acting  by anyone here.

1669587,A1NGNQHOKPBFP3,B00EVU3RGE,Jon Stevens,"[8, 13]","Incredibly, financed by Jews, helmed by an excellent Lebanese Christian director, one wonders instead of making a film about the Palestinian slaughter of tens upon tens of thousands of Maronite Christians in Lebanon between 1970 & 1990 nearly exterminating the entire Christian community if it were not for the IDF's intervention, why he'd make this cunning and insidious pro-Palestinian propaganda that seeks to justify their murder and maiming of Israeli civilians including children? Why cunning?Here's the emotional story of a successful Palestinian (Israeli-Arab) doctor working at a Tel Aviv, Israel hospital who discovers that his Christian-Palestinian wife carried out a suicide bombing in a restaurant that murdered 17 civilians, 11 of whom are children, leaving 8 maimed for life. Arrested & interrogated, the Israeli cops release him once they supposedly cleared him of suspicion that he knew his wife was a terrorist (one of the big holes in the script). Convinced she's not the bomber, he gets his wake up call when he receives a letter from his wife sent from Nablus, a West Bank city which makes him realize that his wife indeed was the suicide bomber. Upset, he decides to investigate how, who, and why she'd do such a dastardly act of murder & maiming of the people he has grown to live among, and especially being married to him - a prosperous loving husband and doctor who had been able to successfully assimilate into Israeli society, even winning its medical world ""Oscar"" award for his excellent work, bestowing on her the perks of his job, nice house, American Jeep Cherokee, etc.Seeking answers, he goes to Nablus determined to meet those who convinced her to strap on the suicide explosives belt, making her into a martyr for the cause of liberating and recovering every inch of territory of Palestine as Jews have no claim to it and do not belong there, and neither does anyone else (Christians, hint, hint). Facing danger as he is perceived as a ""collaborator"" perhaps working for Israeli intelligence and therefore persona non-grata, staying at his family's villa with its great view of the city, layer by layer he discovers some of his relatives may be involved, and when he finally meets the Shiek who he believes sent his wife to her martyrdom, he turns out to be a priest who tells him that his people aren't fanatic crazy goons but people fighting for their freedom & dignity, and that his wife was a heroic martyr who acted in revenge for Israeli atrocities vs the Palestinians, in particular a mythical ""massacre"" in Jenin. Doc goes there and finds rubble next to a beautiful high rise apartment building where supposedly the ""massacre"" had occurred, therefore justifying her actions in murdering and maiming Israeli children. He goes back to Tel Aviv chastened and wiser about his heroic wife.This of course happens near the end, and to anyone not educated with the history of the conflict between the Arabs and Israel, it will create sympathy for the wonderful, peace loving, victimized Palestinians. Matter of fact, there is even a scene of Israeli soldiers abusing such Palestinians at a road block (if anyone had behaved that way trying to obstruct the work of soldiers, for example US troops in Iraq or Afghanistan, or acted the way the Palestinians did in Syria or any other Arab country, they would have been killed immediately). However, as articulated in The Attack, Israelis are obviously held by a different standard. They can be abused, but are not allowed to react because if they did, they would be judged as oppressors. And then there is the ""separation wall' with barbed wire on top making it look ominous, like the Palestinians are imprisoned, yet, Nablus seems prosperous, for certain ain't nobody starving there. Homes are beautiful, streets alive and crowded with shoppers, beautiful city without a sign of an ""occupation"". It's never mentioned that the wall was put up to stop Palestinian murder squads or suicide bombers from entering Israel which is why this star-crossed doctor's wife went to the lengths she did marrying a man who could give her access to blow herself up in a restaurant crowded with mothers & children, a fact that is hinted at but not elaborated, namely: this doctor was merely a tool, a facilitator. Of course it's never mentioned that King Hussein of Jordan's Bedouin army during one weekend in September 1970 killed an estimated 10,000 Palestinians who tried to overthrow his kingdom, a number that Israeli self-defense actions have never, ever reached, including the mythical ""Jenin massacre"". Nor is it mentioned that the IDF invasion of Jenin happened after hundreds of Israeli civilians were murdered and maimed by Arafat's goon squads.One of the biggest holes in the story...when the doctor drives off from his expensive suburban home in his American Jeep Cherokee, the camera is viewing this from a car behind him, which starts following him. There is no payoff to this as we're never told who is following him, is it the Israeli cop, his nephew? To think that the tough Israeli cop will not tail this doctor is absurd, yet this is left hanging without resolution. Neither is there a payoff to this doctor considered a much despised ""collaborator"" allowed to go about free. He's hated even if his wife gave her life for Palestine. Yet, we've all seen on TV the brutality perpetrated by Palestinian vs suspected collaborators and additionally aside from their genocide against the Maronite Christians in Lebanon, we've seen Palestinians brutally killing each other when HAMAS and PLO fought over Gaza, murdering fathers in front of their wives and children, killing collaborators and dragging their bodies tied behind motorcycles throughout the city (see You Tube). So for this doctor, in all likelihood leading the Israeli cops to the killers, to go free is ridiculous as we're dealing with a mighty smart, brutal bunch of ruthlessly violent people, not the nice ""occupied"" victims we're led to believe they are who in 1929 before they were occupied, slaughtered the entire unarmed Jewish population of Hebron and since 1948 have murdered and maimed thousands of Israeli men, women, teens, children, and even babies whose throats they slit last year (in addition to 100 doctors and nurses they murdered and mutilated when they ambushed an unarmed Jewish medical convoy on its way to Mount Scorpius in Jerusalem in 1948).What's baffling is while the US makes movies like Lone Survivor about Americans as heroes, most Israeli films are blatantly anti-Israeli and pro-Arab...it's as if the Israeli people in their quest to seem morally superior to the Arabs so busy slaughtering each other in Syria and elsewhere, are intent to help their merciless enemy achieve what they have not been able to achieve by war and terrorism: demonizing Israel with outrageous films, and these short-sighted Jews are digging their own graves, which is why I found this simplistic, utterly cunning Palestinian film so deeply disturbing.As a film, it's well directed, well acted by a strong cast, beautifully photographed and edited, music is moody and appropriate (why I gave it two stars instead of one) definitely another major victory for the exceedingly effective Palestinian PR machine, this time contributed by an excellent self-righteous Lebanese Christian filmmaker backed by Jewish & French money, supported by Israeli crews and actors who ignore the damage they're inflicting upon the already terrible image of their country.Israelis may be great warriors fighting with valor on the battlefield, but they are losers with PR, decimated by the biased anti-Israeli US & International media, UN, and films as this one, etc. The Palestinians who have grasped the power of film as a PR tool must be laughing at their smug, self-destructive enemy exploiting their weakness aspiring to live up to their self-proclaimed image as a civilized democratic society. Well, Israel, the Palestinians don't play by your rules, but rather, they use them for furtherance of their one singular powerful objective: your destruction, well articulated when the doctor travels by cab in Nablus listening to a fiery message of a Palestinian leader pronouncing a death sentence for Israel.I personally believe, (and frankly I care not who agrees or disagrees) The Attack film will appeal to the wealthy, liberal much misplaced so called ""intellectual"" leftist cowardly American, European and Israeli Jewish Palestinian apologists who forgot history; it should appeal greatly to Palestinians, Arabs (even as it was banned in Lebanon guilty of being too liberal in its portrayal of the Israelis & fact that the director dared filming in Israel...), Nazis, other Zionist hating racists both gentile and Ultra-Orthodox Jewish-American Brooklyn based Neturei Karta Israel hating fanatics, and the uneducated in Middle Eastern history gullible general American, anti-Semitic European public looking for - and with this film, successfully justifying Palestinian atrocities against Israeli civilians, children included of course.In conclusion, The Attack could have been a breakthrough film had its director focused on its true cinematic theme: ""The obsessed with a cause will do anything to achieve their agenda regardless of the pain they inflict not only on their enemy, but their own"". A lost opportunity I'd say, difference between good filmmaking and great.",2,Justifying terrorism vs civilians,1390176000,"01 20, 2014",2014,9405,"['Incredibly', 'financed', 'Jews', 'helmed',

1669590,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00EVU3RGE,M. Oleson,"[0, 0]","Amin Jaafari (Ali Suliman) is in an unusual place.  He is a rare Arab who has found a place for himself and his wife, Siham (Reymond Amsalem) in Tel Aviv.  Amin is a renowned surgeon in one of Israel's most prestigious hospitals.  On the day he receives one of medicine's highest honors, a Palestinian suicide-bomber kills 17 people in a restaurant, most of which are kids at a birthday party.  Hours later, Amin is called back to the hospital to identify a body, believed to be his wife.  It is and she is suspected of being the bomber, not another victim.Early on, Amin is treated poorly by the police, suspected of being aware, if not involved, in the terrorism.  Eventually cleared, he is released but is scorned by his neighbors and others.  A few friends remain loyal, but Amin cannot believe that after 15 years of marriage, he was unaware of his wife's intentions.  This confusion and uncertainty leads him on a detective-like mission to find out how this could have happened.  It leads him back to a small town in the Palestinian Territory where he gets closer and closer to the answers he seeks but perhaps doesn't want to hear.The film directed and co-written by Lebanese native Ziad Doueiri is often hard to watch and even hard to imagine but we all know, events like this are real.  Doueiri manages to keep a somewhat balanced perspective, but the killing of children is hard to balance in my mind.  From Doueir's perspective, while he never condones the particular act, he never goes back to the victims either.  In any case the film certainly doesn't give us hope that there will ever be a solution to this Middle East conflict given the festering hatred between the sides.The Blu ray transfer comes in 1080p and a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  Detail is excellent.  The colors are honest but don't stand out as filming is often done in low light.  The exteriors are in dusty browns and grey, perhaps consistent with the geography.  Skin tones are very good.  Excellent video presentation.  The audio comes with a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 option.  The film is surprisingly a very quiet affair outside a few scenes at the hospital.  Even as Amion travels to the Palestinian territory, events are rather subdued.  No yelling and screaming here.  Perhaps Doueiri does have a bias.  In any case the dialog heavy film is clear and well-focused.  Not much goes on in the surrounds, not even Eric Neveux's fine score.  Extras are minimal.  A 4  minute interview with Doueiri, a trailer and some photos.  Subtitles come in English only.",4,(BLU RAY REVIEW) I was married to a suicide-bomber (and never knew),1396310400,"04 1, 2014",2014,2534,"['Amin', 'Jaafari', 'Ali', 'Suliman', 'unusual', 'place', 'rare', 'Arab', 'who', 'found', 'place', 'wife', 'Siham', 'Reymond', 'Amsalem', 'Tel', 'Aviv', 'Amin', 'renowned', 'surgeon', 'one', 'Israel', 'most', 'prestigious', 'hospitals', 'day', 'one', 'medicine', 'highest', 'honors', 'Palestinian', 'suicide-bomber', 'kills', '17', 'people', 'restaurant', 'most', 'are', 'kids', 'birthday', 'party', 'Hours', 'later', 'Amin', 'called', 'back', 'hospital', 'identify', 'body', 'believed', 'be', 'wife', 'suspected', 'being', 'bomber', 'not', 'victim.Early', 'Amin', 'treated', 'poorly', 'police', 'suspected', 'being', 'aware', 'not', 'involved', 'terrorism', 'Eventually', 'cleared', 'released', 'scorned', 'neighbors', 'others', 'few', 'friends', 'remain', 'loyal', 'Amin', 'can', 'not', 'believe', '15', 'years', 'marriage', 'was', 'unaware', 'wife', 'intentions', 'confusion', 'uncertainty', 'detective-like', 'mission', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'could', 'have', 'happened', 'back', 'small', 'town', 'Palestinian', 'Territory', 'where', 'closer', 'closer', 'answers', 'perhaps', ""n't"", 'want', 'hear.The', 'film', 'directed', 'co-written', 'Lebanese', 'native', 'Ziad', 'Doueiri', 'often', 'hard', 'watch', 'even', 'hard', 'imagine', 'know', 'events', 'are', 'real', 'Doueiri', 'keep', 'somewhat', 'balanced', 'perspective', 'killing', 'children', 'hard', 'balance', 'mind', 'Doueir', 'perspective', 'never', 'particular', 'act', 'never', 'back', 'victims', 'case', 'film', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'give', 'hope', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'solution', 'Middle', 'East', 'conflict', 'given', 'festering', 'hatred', 'sides.The', 'Blu', 'ray', 'transfer', '1080p', '2.40:1', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'Detail', 'excellent', 'colors', 'are', 'honest', 'do', ""n't"", 'stand', 'out', 'filming', 'often', 'done', 'low', 'light', 'exteriors', 'are', 'dusty', 'browns', 'grey', 'perhaps', 'consistent', 'geography', 'Skin', 'tones', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'Excellent', 'video', 'presentation', 'audio', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', '5.1', 'option', 'film', 'surprisingly', 'very', 'quiet', 'affair', 'few', 'scenes', 'hospital', 'Even', 'Amion', 'Palestinian', 'territory', 'events', 'are', 'rather', 'subdued', 'yelling', 'screaming', 'here', 'Perhaps', 'Doueiri', 'have', 'bias', 'case', 'dialog', 'heavy', 'film', 'clear', 'well-focused', 'Not', 'much', 'surrounds', 'not', 'even', 'Eric', 'Neveux', 'fine', 'score', 'Extras', 'are', 'minimal', '4', 'minute', 'interview', 'Doueiri', 'trailer', 'photos', 'Subtitles', 'come', 'English', 'only']",N/A
1669591,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00EVU3RGE,Paul Allaer,"[11, 14]","""The Attack"" (2013 release from Lebanon; 102 min.) brings the story of Amin (play by Ali Suliman), a successful Arab-Israeli surgeon who is about to receive the highest honor any doctor can receive in Israel for his professional accomplishments. His wife Siham (played by Reymond Amsalem), also Arab, is not with him, though. The next day a suicide bomber in Tel Aviv kills 17 people, including 11 children, and severely wounds scores more, when setting off explosives in a restaurant. Many of them end up in Amin's hospital and he tries all he can to save lives. Later that night, he is called back to the hospital. It turns out Siham was killed in the attack and all signs point to her being the suicide bomber. Amin simply refuses to believe it when pressed by the Israeli police. At this point we're only 25-30 min. into the movie. Was Siham a terrorist? Is Amin being set up by the Israeli police? Could Amin possibly have completely misread his wife? To tell you more would surely ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: first, the movie is based on the 2007 book of the same name by Algerian author Yasmina Khadra. I haven't read the book so I cannot comment on how this compares to the book. Second, many people are unaware that Arab-Israelis make up about 20 percent of Israel's population, and are often very torn in their feelings for their country (Israel) and their spiritual brothers and at times roots in Palestine and other Arab areas. Third, the movie does an excellent job exposing those tormented feelings of Amin as he is on a path to find out what really happened leading up to the attack. As one point Amin is upset with everyone and everything and one of his Jewish friends offers ""Don't let grief your spoil your perspective"" but that's of course easier said than done. This movie flew by in no time and had my attention from start to finish. Beware, the hospital scenes where the wounded are treated make for difficult viewing (I closed my eyes a few times). Bottom line: ""The Attack"" is a great addition to the collection of movies looking at the Israeli-Palestine conflict (another recent movie I'd readily recommend on this topic is ""A Bottle In the Gaza Sea""). As such, ""The Attack"" deserves and needs to be seen by both sides. But to give you an idea how absurd things have become, the movie has been banned by all Arab countries, for the ""crime"" of filming part of the movie in Israel. My oh my.I saw this movie in early July at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati, and I'm happy to say that the screening where I saw this at, was very nicely attended, giving me hope that there is a strong demand for this movie, be it in the theatre or on DVD/Blu-ray. If you are in the mood for compelling movie that adds to the debate on the Israeli-Palestine conflict, you cannot go wrong with this. ""The Attack"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",4,Great addition to movies looking at the Israeli-Palestine conflict,1378339200,"09 5, 2013",2013,2930,"['Attack', '2013', 'release', 'Lebanon', '102', 'min', 'story', 'Amin', 'play', 'Ali', 'Suliman', 'successful', 'Arab-Israeli', 'surgeon', 'who', 'receive', 'highest', 'honor', 'doctor', 'can', 'receive', 'Israel', 'professional', 'accomplishments', 'wife', 'Siham', 'played', 'Reymond', 'Amsalem', 'also', 'Arab', 'not', 'though', 'next', 'day', 'suicide', 'bomber', 'Tel', 'Aviv', '17', 'people', 'including', '11', 'children', 'severely', 'scores', 'more', 'when', 'setting', 'off', 'explosives', 'restaurant', 'Many', 'end', 'up', 'Amin', 'hospital', 'all', 'can', 'save', 'lives', 'Later', 'night', 'called', 'back', 'hospital', 'out', 'Siham', 'was', 'killed', 'attack', 'signs', 'point', 'being', 'suicide', 'bomber', 'Amin', 'simply', 'believe', 'when', 'pressed', 'Israeli', 'police', 'point', ""'re"", 'only', '25-30', 'min', 'movie', 'Was', 'Siham', 'terrorist', 'Amin', 'being', 'set', 'up', 'Israeli', 'police', 'Could', 'Amin', 'possibly', 'have', 'completely', 'misread', 'wife', 'tell', 'more', 'would', 'surely', 'ruin', 'viewing', 'experience', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'see', 'how', 'out.Several', 'comments', 'first', 'movie', 'based', '2007', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'Algerian', 'author', 'Yasmina', 'Khadra', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'can', 'not', 'comment', 'how', 'book', 'Second', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'unaware', 'Arab-Israelis', 'make', 'up', 'about', '20', 'percent', 'Israel', 'population', 'are', 'often', 'very', 'torn', 'feelings', 'country', 'Israel', 'spiritual', 'brothers', 'times', 'roots', 'Palestine', 'other', 'Arab', 'areas', 'Third', 'movie', 'excellent', 'job', 'exposing', 'tormented', 'feelings', 'Amin', 'path', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'leading', 'up', 'attack', 'one', 'point', 'Amin', 'upset', 'everyone', 'everything', 'one', 'Jewish', 'friends', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'grief', 'spoil', 'perspective', 'course', 'easier', 'said', 'done', 'movie', 'flew', 'time', 'had', 'attention', 'start', 'finish', 'Beware', 'hospital', 'scenes', 'where', 'wounded', 'are', 'treated', 'make', 'difficult', 'viewing', 'closed', 'eyes', 'few', 'times', 'Bottom', 'line', 'Attack', 'great', 'addition', 'collection', 'movies', 'looking', 'Israeli-Palestine', 'conflict', 'recent', 'movie', ""'d"", 'readily', 'recommend', 'topic', 'A', 'Bottle', 'Gaza', 'Sea', 'such', 'Attack', 'deserves', 'needs', 'be', 'seen', 'sides', 'give', 'idea', 'how', 'absurd', 'things', 'have', 'become', 'movie', 'been', 'banned', 'Arab', 'countries', 'crime', 'filming', 'part', 'movie', 'Israel', 'oh', 'my.I', 'saw', 'movie', 'early', 'July', 'local', 'art-house', 'theatre', 'here', 'Cincinnati', ""'m"", 'happy', 'say', 'screening', 'where', 'saw', 'was', 'very', 'nicely', 'attended', 'giving', 'hope', 'strong', 'demand', 'movie', 'be', 'theatre', 'DVD/Blu-ray', 'are', 'mood', 'compelling', 'movie', 'debate', 'Israeli-Palestine', 'conflict', 'can', 'not', 'go', 'wrong', 'Attack', 'HIGHLY', 'RECOMMENDED']",N/A
