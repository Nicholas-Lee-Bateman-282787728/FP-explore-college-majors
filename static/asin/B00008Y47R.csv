If you read his actual biography, you find out that he became a mythical folk hero to the Jews of Europe... he wasn't just an unintentional symbol, but called himself the Jewish Samson and lectured avidely on behalf of the then budding Zionist movement.  In contrast, his charactor in the film doesn't seem to be the shapest knife in the drawer.  - - In the film, though a hero to the Jews of Germany, when he returns to the Schtetles (where the real Zisha was a true folk hero) he's made into a virtual laughing stock with his predictions as to the rise of Nazism.  (*And is it just me, or do some of those beards look rather fake...?) - - Not to spoil the end of the film if you haven't seen it, I'll only say that the real Zeisha died in 1925 from blood poisining as a result of an injury from a stage stunt.All in all... great story... Werner Herzog, despite being a great film director might have done better to hire professionals... because virtually every element of the film BUT the acting reflects his greatness... unfortunately wouldn't one expect a director of Herzog's callibre to realize that acting... ummmm... does count...",3,"Great story and Script, but the acting ?????",1086566400,"06 7, 2004",2004,2568,"['was', 'bit', 'confused', 'start', 'film', 'when', 'thought', 'detected', 'what', 'sounded', 'bit', 'Swedish', 'accent', 'Jew', 'living', 'Polish', 'schtetle', 'who', 'was', 'being', 'idealistically', 'lectured', 'suspiciously', 'non', 'grizzly', 'looking', 'blond', 'hair', 'little', 'boy', 'bit', 'Brittish', 'accent', 'story', 'great', 'film', 'apparent', 'Herzog', 'may', 'have', 'gotten', 'bit', 'carried', 'away', 'genius', 'director', 'almost', 'say', ""'m"", 'such', 'great', 'director', 'could', 'take', 'anybody', 'make', 'look', 'great', 'actors', 'uhhhhhh', 'not', 'so', 'Likewise', 'maybe', 'thought', 'having', 'real', 'people', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'more', 'realistic', 'feel', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'OUTSTANDING', 'performance', 'evil', 'charactor', 'gushes', 'few', 'other', 'actors', 'well', 'one', 'wonder', 'film', 'What', 'going', 'here', 'Keep', 'mind', 'saw', 'film', 'realizing', 'was', 'Herzog', 'film', 'was', 'wondering', 'maybe', 'was', 'good', 'film', 'director', 'who', 'well', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'there', 'yet', 'still', 'had', 'good', 'story', 'tell', 'Still', 'scenes', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'climatic', 'Jewish', 'Samson', 'announcing', 'room', 'Nazis', 'was', 'indeed', 'Jew', 'others', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'drab', 'whereas', 'others', 'virtually', 'scene', 'Roth', 'appeared', 'were', 'full', 'passion', 'energy', 'comparison', 'end', 'result', 'felt', 'true', 'significance', 'Zeisha', 'charactor', 'was', 'lost', 'read', 'actual', 'biography', 'find', 'out', 'became', 'mythical', 'folk', 'hero', 'Jews', 'Europe', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'unintentional', 'symbol', 'called', 'Jewish', 'Samson', 'lectured', 'avidely', 'behalf', 'then', 'budding', 'Zionist', 'movement', 'contrast', 'charactor', 'film', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'shapest', 'knife', 'drawer', 'film', 'hero', 'Jews', 'Germany', 'when', 'Schtetles', 'where', 'real', 'Zisha', 'was', 'true', 'folk', 'hero', 'made', 'virtual', 'laughing', 'stock', 'predictions', 'rise', 'Nazism', 'just', 'do', 'beards', 'look', 'rather', 'fake', 'Not', 'spoil', 'end', 'film', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', ""'ll"", 'only', 'say', 'real', 'Zeisha', 'died', '1925', 'blood', 'poisining', 'result', 'injury', 'stage', 'stunt.All', 'great', 'story', 'Werner', 'Herzog', 'being', 'great', 'film', 'director', 'might', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'hire', 'professionals', 'because', 'virtually', 'element', 'film', 'BUT', 'acting', 'greatness', 'unfortunately', 'would', ""n't"", 'one', 'expect', 'director', 'Herzog', 'callibre', 'realize', 'acting', 'ummmm', 'count']",Invincible

(I think it was seeing something else with Tim Roth that made me decide to get it.) The cover shows a picture of Tim Roth doing a mystical magician type pose and some dice in the background. Never having heard of this movie elsewhere, I assumed that this was some sort of circus/Vegas movie. Hmmm, I guess the joke was on me!Not only does this movie have nothing to do with Vegas or circuses, but Tim Roth isn't even the star of the show even though he is the only name listed on the front of the DVD! Much to my surprise, this is a story that deals with pre-Holocaust Germany and Jewish persecution in the 30's. It is a story about a Polish Jew who finds his way to Berlin as a strong man working as a sideshow for the ""Palace of the Occult."" He stands up to the extreme prejudice he is faced with and ultimately becomes an almost cult hero of the European Jews.The theme of the story really did surprise me, and I must say it was a pleasant surprise. Tim Roth was somewhat misadvertised as the star of the show, but he is terrific as a sleazy scumbag.

A talent agent in the audience proposes that the young man travel to Berlin where there are greater and more profitable audiences for a man of his talents. Once in Berlin, Zishe is employed by Haussen (Tim Roth), an occultist who owns a popular theater specializing in spectacle. Mr. Haussen understands his audience well and strives to show them what they want to see, which at that time was a salve for German egos bruised by World War I and fodder for German egos looking forward to renewed greatness under the rising Nazi tide. Haussen is pleased to add Zishe to his show, but insists that he ""Aryanize"" himself in order to please and not offend the customers. So Zishe puts on a blond wig and takes on the stage persona of ""Siegfried The Iron King"", and the audience adores him.""Invincible"" is a true story, written and directed for the screen by Werner Herzog. The story is so odd and obscure that I am not tempted to question its veracity; no one would make it up. It is also an odd enough tale to overcome the film's length and deliberately slow pace. There are long periods of time where nothing happens in this movie. Unless you are fascinated by occultist dinner theater in prewar Germany -which is somewhat cheesy by today's standards- the long stretches where the story just plateaus are likely to wear on your nerves. On the other hand, it is interesting to observe the particulars of these shows and of their audience. They provide some insight  into the collective self-image in Germany between wars and how political extremists were able to exploit that to advance their own agendas. The performances in ""Invincible"" are all impressive. Tim Roth probably doesn't have the screen presence to be a movie star, but he is one of the best character actors in cinema today, and he does some fine work here. I don't know if Jouko Ahola is known at all in Europe, but he embodies this simple but self-possessed Zishe well. Young Jacob Wein also does as nice job as Zishe's younger brother.

His employer (Tim Roth) Hanussen wants to establish an all-powerful Ministry of the Occult in Hitler's government and the strongman Zishe as the Aryan hero Siegfried, amidst his success, makes a moral decision based on prophecies he is receiving from God to become the New Sampson and fearlessly exposes his Jewishness to the demented Nazi crowd. The rest is history romanticized by Herzog. A beautiful, lyrical, poetic film, an epic tale of the signs which some believe God sends, and which the skeptics miss or mock. Roth as always is excellent, as the mysterious and sinsiter Hanussen, who though tinged with avarice and evil, shows a thin streak of goodness. The film should have won awards for cinematography and Original screen play, although there was a book from which Herzog worked.

It is 1930s and Nazis are getting politically stronger.  Hitler is on his way to assume power.  In remote Polish village a young Jewish blacksmith gets a chance to go to Berlin and become a stage performer.  His amazing physical strength is desirable in the entertainment industry and by changing his name from Zisha to Zigfried he become Nazi image of Arian superiority.  As Zisha decides to confront his audience and his employer by disclosing in public that he is in fact Jewish, things start to unfold in a manner that no one expects. His seemingly brutal, egotistic and cynical employer is himsef a Jew who perhaps hoped that thru his occult powers and hypnotic tricks could influence Hitler and members of high ranking Nazi establishment. As he gets murdered, Zisha comes to realize that he will have to use his newly found personal power to define his purpose in his own life and the life of the Jewish people.  Uneducated and simple, he senses that bad times are coming and hopes to spread prophecy to his people to unite, become strong and resist to the evils of the upcoming German nationalism.  But God has a different plan for him and as it happens he dies in the hospital 2 days before Hitler comes to power and German starts to become threat to the rest of the world.  The most powerful part of the film forme was Zisha's talk with the Berlin rabbi who speaks of 36 ""justs"" that are born in every generation.  Some of them know that they have a purpose on earth and some die not being aware of what their purpose is.  So when they die, the go frozen to Heaven and it takes God 1,000 years to warm them up to life again.  Some may even take longer and every time it happens, God turns a clock of final resurrection a few minutes ahead.  Zisha's heart and mind are pure in spite of his simplicity.  We know that God loves him so much that it is not surprising to see him die as a martyr to his ideas and desires to save his people.  This is a Herzog movie with characters one is used to seeing in his production.  But the weakness of the film is a string of non-professional or simply poor actors. Tim Roth is mesmerizing in his role and in spite of his menacing character, he gets to be loved and accepted at the end.

749123,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B00008Y47R,Trevor Willsmer,"[11, 13]","I saw Werner Herzog's would-be comeback movie in it's English-language version, although it actually appears to have been shot in English as per most of the bigger budget European films. The film found little favor either with critics or at the box-office, but it still has much to commend it.Although a significant supporting character rather than the titular lead, it's a far more accurate portrait of famed German psychic-showman-conman Erik Jan Hanussen, the 'prophet' of the Nazi Party, than Istvan Szabo's Hanussen which, like Colonel Redl, took ample liberties with the facts to make dramatic capitol albeit with less success. Herzog's film has it's historical failings to - in truth Hanussen's downfall was linked to his prediction of the Reichstag Fire and the large number of IOUs senior he collected from senior Nazi Party members, including Goebbels and Himmler. But by linking his fate to that of the Jewish strongman he promotes as the Aryan Siegfried (in real life the two men were professional rivals), Herzog does offer a convincing portrait of the dilemma facing Jews in the early days of Nazi Germany: do you hide and assimilate to earn their approval or do you assert your identity all the stronger?For Hanussen, the answer is to latch onto the rising star of the Nazi Party in the hope that money and power can insulate him (and in truth he was Hitler's personal clairvoyant and, shortly before exposed as a Jew by the communist press, in line to head the Nazi Ministry of the Occult: Hanussen privately wrote that he thought Nazi anti-Semitism was mere electioneering and that Hitler could be swayed by 'good Jews'). Ultimately he fails because underestimates the savagery and severity of the baser instincts he taps into. For the innocent strongman Zishe Breitbart, things are not so simple. As he awakens to the danger and rebels, he finds himself unable to rouse his people and is ultimately brought down by little more than a scratch. Both find themselves unable to control events, merely to predict the inevitable outcome of the terrible movement of history that will allow neither assimilation nor resistance.It's great raw material, but it's never quite there. As a film it's intriguing and Hanussen's stage act is compellingly recreated through Tim Roth's unsympathetic playing (unlike Brandauer and Szabo's version, this Hanussen is ultimately a cruel victim of his own hubris and self-deception), but Jouko Ahola is not a strong enough pair of acting shoulders as Zishe - he may be able to carry an elephant, but he can't carry the movie. His performance isn't especially bad and it's probably an accurate reflection of the real man, but there's a lack of star quality that enables Roth to walk away with the film and for his absence in the last quarter to add not just an air of futility but of 'Where do we go from here?' padding to it.Some of the early Shtetl scenes are a little awkwardly paced, the fledgling romance doesn't really work and the script is over-reliant on the audience bringing pre-existing knowledge about the characters to the film (for example, it is never explained that Udo Kier's Count Helldorf was the infamously corrupt and perverted head of the Berlin SA who ultimately murdered Hanussen) so a non-German or less-informed audience will definitely get less out of the film. There's also a lack of context - we see very little of what is happening on the streets with much of the action confined to Hanussen's lavishly recreated Palace of the Occult. But despite it's shortfalls, it's still an intriguing film that, while it never engages the emotions, has more than enough compensations to make it well worth catching.",3,Questions of identity and assimilation in Herzog's near-miss,1100476800,"11 15, 2004",2004,3678,"['saw', 'Werner', 'Herzog', 'would-be', 'comeback', 'movie', 'English-language', 'version', 'actually', 'have', 'been', 'shot', 'English', 'most', 'bigger', 'budget', 'European', 'films', 'film', 'found', 'little', 'favor', 'critics', 'box-office', 'still', 'much', 'commend', 'significant', 'supporting', 'character', 'rather', 'titular', 'lead', 'far', 'more', 'accurate', 'portrait', 'famed', 'German', 'psychic-showman-conman', 'Erik', 'Jan', 'Hanussen', ""'prophet"", 'Nazi', 'Party', 'Istvan', 'Szabo', 'Hanussen', 'Colonel', 'Redl', 'took', 'ample', 'liberties', 'facts', 'make', 'dramatic', 'capitol', 'less', 'success', 'Herzog', 'film', 'historical', 'failings', 'truth', 'Hanussen', 'downfall', 'was', 'linked', 'prediction', 'Reichstag', 'Fire', 'large', 'number', 'IOUs', 'senior', 'collected', 'senior', 'Nazi', 'Party', 'members', 'including', 'Goebbels', 'Himmler', 'linking', 'fate', 'Jewish', 'strongman', 'Aryan', 'Siegfried', 'real', 'life', 'two', 'men', 'were', 'professional', 'rivals', 'Herzog', 'offer', 'convincing', 'portrait', 'dilemma', 'facing', 'Jews', 'early', 'days', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'do', 'hide', 'assimilate', 'earn', 'approval', 'do', 'assert', 'identity', 'stronger', 'Hanussen', 'answer', 'latch', 'rising', 'star', 'Nazi', 'Party', 'hope', 'money', 'power', 'can', 'insulate', 'truth', 'was', 'Hitler', 'personal', 'clairvoyant', 'shortly', 'before', 'exposed', 'Jew', 'communist', 'press', 'line', 'head', 'Nazi', 'Ministry', 'Occult', 'Hanussen', 'privately', 'wrote', 'thought', 'Nazi', 'anti-Semitism', 'was', 'mere', 'electioneering', 'Hitler', 'could', 'be', 'swayed', ""'good"", 'Jews', 'Ultimately', 'savagery', 'severity', 'baser', 'innocent', 'strongman', 'Zishe', 'Breitbart', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'simple', 'danger', 'rebels', 'unable', 'rouse', 'people', 'ultimately', 'brought', 'down', 'little', 'more', 'scratch', 'find', 'unable', 'control', 'events', 'merely', 'predict', 'inevitable', 'outcome', 'terrible', 'movement', 'history', 'will', 'allow', 'assimilation', 'resistance.It', 'great', 'raw', 'material', 'never', 'quite', 'there', 'film', 'intriguing', 'Hanussen', 'stage', 'act', 'compellingly', 'recreated', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'unsympathetic', 'playing', 'Brandauer', 'Szabo', 'version', 'Hanussen', 'ultimately', 'cruel', 'victim', 'own', 'hubris', 'self-deception', 'Jouko', 'Ahola', 'not', 'strong', 'enough', 'pair', 'acting', 'shoulders', 'Zishe', 'may', 'be', 'able', 'carry', 'elephant', 'ca', ""n't"", 'carry', 'movie', 'performance', ""n't"", 'especially', 'bad', 'probably', 'accurate', 'reflection', 'real', 'man', 'lack', 'star', 'quality', 'Roth', 'walk', 'away', 'film', 'absence', 'last', 'quarter', 'add', 'not', 'just', 'air', 'futility', ""'Where"", 'do', 'go', 'here', 'padding', 'it.Some', 'early', 'Shtetl', 'scenes', 'are', 'little', 'awkwardly', 'paced', 'fledgling', 'romance', ""n't"", 'really', 'work', 'script', 'over-reliant', 'audience', 'bringing', 'pre-existing', 'knowledge', 'characters', 'film', 'example', 'never', 'explained', 'Udo', 'Kier', 'Count', 'Helldorf', 'was', 'infamously', 'corrupt', 'perverted', 'head', 'Berlin', 'SA', 'who', 'ultimately', 'murdered', 'Hanussen', 'non-German', 'less-informed', 'audience', 'will', 'definitely', 'get', 'less', 'film', 'also', 'lack', 'context', 'see', 'very', 'little', 'what', 'happening', 'streets', 'much', 'action', 'confined', 'Hanussen', 'lavishly', 'recreated', 'Palace', 'Occult', 'shortfalls', 'still', 'intriguing', 'film', 'never', 'emotions', 'more', 'enough', 'compensations', 'make', 'well', 'catching']",Invincible
749124,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00008Y47R,Tsuyoshi,"[4, 4]","""Invincible"" is directed by German director Werner Herzog, who is known for his very unique films like ""Aguirre"" and ""Fitzcarrald"" all visually stunning, but not for everybody's taste (some say too slow-moving).  Here he comes back with a strongly allegorical tale loosely based on truth about Hanussen and Zishe Breitbart in the time before the Nazi and WW2.In 1932, Poland.  During this unstable time, there was a gentle-hearted Jewish blacksmith named Zishe, who is living with his smart young brother and family.  Having a big body and incredible strength, he is invited by a travelling agent to come to Berlin to work there.  He agrees, and leaves the family to meet Hanussen. self-appointed master of clairvoyance and prophet of the time.  Hanussen likes Zishe's physical appearance, so hiding his identy, Hanussen dresses him up as hero Siegfried, showing him on stage before the Nazi troopers.  During this unhappy period, he meets a pianist girl named Marta ""employed"" by Hanussen, and finds his only comfort in her.The story, if written down like this, might sound trite and banal, but the reality is different.  Herzog presents the story like a Greek myth, underlining its allegorical meanings found in the life of Zishe, whom you might find one biblical figure.  As he undergoes joy and agory, he realizes what he has to do for his people back in Poland, but the tragic events are, as we know, soon to come.  Though the film refuses to show the plights of Jewish people inflicted by Hitler, we sense it is coming there, and Herzog's sometimes bizarre but striking images -- see red crabs, lots of them -- are very effective in reminding us that.As to Hanussen, played by Tim Roth, he also successfully shows the fragile and tragic aspects of humans under the mask of greedy entrepreneur.  The relation beteen him and Zishe is strangely attractive, both having nothing in common except one (that will be revealed at the end).  But keep this in mind; he plays rather a suporting role, not the protagonist.Not everything is perfect, I must say.  It is obvious that Jouko Ahola as Zishe and Anna Gourari as Marta are both amateurs as far as acting is concerned.  Ahola is really the ""strongest man"" and won the contest, and Gourari is also really a concert pianist.  For the director like Herzog, it is only natural that he cast the real strong man and real pianist into the roles of the strong man and the pianist.  But before the professional like Tim Roth, the contrast is too much to ignore.  You cannot say this, but you might really miss Klaus Kinski here.But I was curiously involved in the story, which is not told in a sophisticated fahion, but still always remains strong.  And there is an impressive cameo of character actor Udo Kier as Count Helldorf, which is too deghtful to watch.About Hanussen and Zishe, this film is, I think, Herzog's own version, so you might try to find some books on these interesting people  (I actually know another version of story, which tells that they are not partners, but rivals.)  And acclaimed Hungarian director Istvan Szabo once made a film about Hanussen (the title, ""Hanussen"").

749125,AFVC03JNPWNPP,B00008Y47R,"""youngvelvet""","[2, 3]",'Invincible' is an unbelievably powerful film. After an eleven year absence from feature films 'Invincible' proves that Werner Herzog is the greatest living film-maker. Although far from being his best film ('The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser' and 'Aguirre the Wrath of God' are his greatest films) this film has an amazing power and is reminiscent of 'The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser'. Jouko Ahola's performance as Zische Breitbart is the most innocent portrayal I've ever seen given by an actor. The final scene in this film had me crying uncontrollably. This is the second best film of 2002 behind Polanski's 'The Pianist'.,5,Werner Herzog's Ecstatic Truth,1049241600,"04 2, 2003",2003,616,"[""'Invincible"", 'unbelievably', 'powerful', 'film', 'eleven', 'year', 'absence', 'feature', 'films', ""'Invincible"", 'proves', 'Werner', 'Herzog', 'greatest', 'living', 'film-maker', 'far', 'being', 'best', 'film', ""'The"", 'Enigma', 'Kaspar', 'Hauser', 'Wrath', 'God', 'are', 'greatest', 'films', 'film', 'amazing', 'power', 'reminiscent', ""'The"", 'Enigma', 'Kaspar', 'Hauser', 'Jouko', 'Ahola', 'performance', 'Zische', 'Breitbart', 'most', 'innocent', 'portrayal', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'given', 'actor', 'final', 'scene', 'film', 'had', 'crying', 'uncontrollably', 'second', 'best', 'film', '2002', 'Polanski', ""'The"", 'Pianist']",Invincible
