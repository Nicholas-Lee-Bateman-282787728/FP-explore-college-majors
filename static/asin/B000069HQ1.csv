707120,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B000069HQ1,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[2, 3]","I remember my first time I changed schools when I was young.  It was hard, it was emotional, and by George, I never quite think I ever turned back into the boy I once was.  Changing schools is hard when you are young - or at any age - but was the film ""The New Guy"", clich&eacute; ridden from the beginning throughout the end, needed to help those under-privileged tweens prepare themselves for a choice they probably had no decision in?  Why I am rambling instead of immediately jumping in why so many others denounced this film?  To be honest, and this will probably shock you, I felt a soft spot for this film.  It could have been the multitude of cameos.  Maybe it was the shockingly impassioned DJ Qualls, or maybe it was the fact that this reminded me of a different time in cinema where movies were made to just be funny.  ""The New Guy"" felt like one part ""Can't Hardly Wait"", one part ""Empire Records"", with one part actually feeling like a dud Pauley Shore movie.  You probably hate me already, but these elements clicked with me.  Now, this wasn't Oscar-caliber in any way shape or form, but it did hold my attention, made me chuckle, and made me appreciate classic 90s (early 00s) tween comedy.The plot surrounding this film could be found anywhere.  Qualls plays Dizzy Harrison, a nobody determined to be someone this year in school.  A debacle - of which will not be mentioned - sends him screaming to the nurses office and eventually into jail.  It is during his moments of detention that he meets with Luther (the low-point of the film Eddie Griffin), who teaches him to act like he is a different person.  It sticks, Dizzy goes to another school under the pseudonym of Gil Harris - wins the hearts of the students, a hot cheerleader named Danielle (Eliza Dushku), and nearly looses all of his friends.  Will he be able to live the high life he has created, or will his past catch up to him?  If you cannot answer this question, it is obvious you need to start watching more movies.  Like I said when I started this, the plot isn't something you want to spend your Sunday writing to Grandma about - it is the passion of the characters, the enthusiasm of the creators, and the easy-going spirit of the film that actually hooked me more than I anticipated.  I liked the jokes.  I liked laughing at Lyle Lovett getting hit in the eye with a flaming marshmallow, I liked the fact that Vanilla Ice was playing a FYE-esque employee with a mean streak, and I loved whenever those O'Connell boys were on the screen.  Something about these moments took me back when comedies prided themselves on weak plots and cameos galore.  One could almost say this was a precursor to the ""Scary Movie"" franchise, except better executed.The plot is feeble.  That has been established already.  The plot wasn't bad, it was just clich&eacute; ridden to the point where you could care less what was going to happen (because it was predictable prior to it happening), but wanted to see our characters - Qualls, Dushku, Deschanel, Lovett, O'Connell, and more (Gene Simmons as a Reverend?) - were headed.  I can't say that I loved the characters, but they kept my attention on screen more than I thought.  I think what impressed me about this film was that it didn't rely on crass body humor to progress the plot, the jokes (while weak) did have some moments of creativity to them.  Someone tried to give this film a cult standing, but failed - but not without going out fighting.  I applaud this attempt.  The characters worked well together.  Whether you were waiting for another priceless cameo or just watching Qualls bumble around Dushku, I was following it.  This combination was perfect with a cool beverage, a warm evening, and a desire to laugh.  There wasn't any high level of expectation - and I think that is where ""The New Guy"" succeeded.  It knew where it wanted to be, and it didn't strive to go further.  I have been hesitant to see ""Borat"" because of the hype that everyone applauds to it, so in this instance the bar has been set too high.  For ""The New Guy"", I knew very little about it outside of the previews that I had seen in other films for this one.  I didn't want to see this movie, but when it arrived, I wasn't scared to put it in my DVD player.  I was happy.  This was a chuckle filled film.Another element that I really enjoyed was the parody connection.  ""The New Guy"" parodied other films of that year (or older/younger) and you just don't see that anymore.  Outside of the obvious parody films that have been released lately (shall we never speak of ""Epic Movie"" again), Hollywood tends to avoid this in modern cinema, but for this critic is has always made me laugh.  Why do you think I own ""The Critic"" series?  I thought this really enforced this film's standard - again - without going over the preset bar, it brought a new level of comedy to the surface and writer David Kendall coupled with the direction of Ed Decter did a great job of keeping performances low, cameos high, and intelligence mediocre.  There was a level of understanding that this was a decent film, but it didn't want the general public to know it.Overall, I could complain about the bad parts of this film all day, I could also speak highly of other parts that I just seemed to cobble up like leftover cake, but I am not.  I will suggest this film to friends and family, let them be grumpy with me for a bit, but I liked this movie.  It is not one that will be added to my collection, but for the time and place that I am currently at ""The New Guy"" hit the spot.  Qualls isn't the greatest comedian, but his comic timing is genuine.  His matching with Dushku was preposterous and we all knew, but we went along anyway because it was a comfortable clich&eacute;.  I like the comfortable clich&eacute;s.Don't skip it, but don't knock it till you see it.  Surprise yourself.Grade: *** out of *****",3,Don't laugh ... we all remember your first day as the new guy!,1187395200,"08 18, 2007",2007,5890,"['remember', 'first', 'time', 'changed', 'schools',

He plays funk music with a band of fellow outcasts calling themselves blips, as in radar blips.  When he is humiliated at school the first day of his senior year, he flips at a mall, and is put in jail for the night.  Where he meets his anti-hero mentor, the hillarious Eddie Griffith.  There he has an epiphanie, high school is a lot like prison.  So if he treats it like prison, he will survive.  So he gets kicked out of High School, and creates a bad boy persona.  Not only does he survive, but he thrives, becoming the most popular kid in high school.The story isn't anything new, a nerd learns he is strong and becomes popular, but it doesn't follow lame pc and sensitive story ideas.

However a  guardian angel of sorts appears in the guise of a prisoner named Luther (Eddie Griffin). With Luther's expert guidance Dizzy gets himself expelled from school (For the mortal sin of purposely snapping a mop in half. Oh my, how anti-social); and with an image makeover Dizzy begins afresh at a new school as &quot;Gil Harris&quot;- the Baddest Mofo on campus- complete with a new 'do that's described by Luther as 'Brad Pitt in &quot;Fight Club&quot; crossed with Anne Heche in &quot;If These Walls Could Talk&quot;'.

707130,AWUWTU5SAUOQO,B000069HQ1,Charles E. Williams III,"[2, 2]","I went into ""The New Guy"" on May 10 (opening day) not really expecting a lot. To be honest, I was afraid it would end up as another ""Meet The Parents"" or ""Dude, Where's My Car ?"", movies that looked really funny in their respective trailers, yet they turned out to have had all their really excellently funny moments spoiled by those same trailers. I feared the same fate for ""The New Guy."" Still, it stars Eliza Dushku, and that reason alone gave me the courage to give it a fair chance. And, I gotta tell ya, it was really a pleasant surprise ! It stars DJ Qualls as Dizzy, a member of a rock/funk band and the kid everyone picks on at his high school. One thing leads to another, and he ends up in jail with Eddie Griffin (""Armageddon,"" ""Undercover Brother""), who shows him how to really get people to notice him, this time for the better. He shows up at a rival high school and quickly becomes recognized as the coolest guy there. Eventually, he catches the eye of the head cheerleader (Eliza Dushku), and the two hit it off really well. Of course, when you're new and have everyone's attention, those who used to rule the school are bound to get jealous and look for any kind of dirt they can find on you. Again, this movie was a big surprise for me, especially the skimpy outfits Eliza Dushku wears, and I will be so bold as to label it one of the most fun movie experiences of the year. Perhaps most surprising of all is the ending, which will catch first-time viewers off guard and likely send them falling from their chairs with laughter, and is perfect for the kind of movie that ""The New Guy"" is. Rated PG-13, it does not have as much foul language as other teen comedies like ""American Pie,"" but it does contain scenes of serious injuries to a man's most personal area.

There are worthy performances here from DJ Qualls, Eddie Griffin (as a crazy-eyed inmate), and a young Zoey Deschanel. The jokes and premise have grown a bit stale, and I could see how heavily influenced this movie was by the heavy hitters of its time (like the ""American Pie"" series, for instance). Nonetheless, there is actually a very heartwarming story buried in this (presumably) low budget teen comedy, about being true to oneself and loving that person, as opposed to being consumed with gaining the approval of others. And this movie was actually a bit before its time, because it aggressively addresses the issue of high school bullying, rightly condemning it.However, this just isn't a laugh-out-loud movie, when compared to the best of its peers during the early 2000s (with top honors going to ""Not Another Teen Movie"", which has oddly proven to be rather timeless). I certainly got some enjoyment out of it, and I think others who were in high school/college during the filming of ""The New Guy"" will also be able to glean some nostalgic value from it (wow, that wonky soundtrack takes me back).Final notes: There are some downright bizarre cameos which I enjoyed, including Vanilla Ice, who has been driven to violence, and Tony Hawk, who is desperate to show off his skateboarding skills. If nothing else, it can certainly be said that this is most likely the only film in which will we ever see Lyle Lovitt take a flaming marshmallow to the eye (yes, that actually happens)!",4,"A retro review from 2013: 11 years later, I reflect upon DJ Qualls' finest hour",1364774400,"04 1, 2013",2013,1620,"['movie', 'not', 'aged', 'quite', 'as', 'gracefully', 'peers', 'same', 'genre', 'time', 'period', 'still', 'merits', 'are', 'worthy', 'performances', 'here', 'DJ', 'Qualls', 'Eddie', 'Griffin', 'crazy-eyed', 'inmate', 'young', 'Zoey', 'Deschanel', 'jokes', 'premise', 'have', 'grown', 'bit', 'stale', 'could', 'see', 'how', 'heavily', 'influenced', 'movie', 'was', 'heavy', 'hitters', 'time', 'American', 'Pie', 'series', 'instance', 'Nonetheless', 'actually', 'very', 'heartwarming', 'story', 'buried', 'presumably', 'low', 'budget', 'teen', 'comedy', 'being', 'true', 'oneself', 'loving', 'person', 'opposed', 'being', 'consumed', 'gaining', 'approval', 'others', 'movie', 'was', 'actually', 'bit', 'time', 'aggressively', 'issue', 'high', 'school', 'bullying', 'rightly', 'condemning', 'it.However', 'just', ""n't"", 'laugh-out-loud', 'movie', 'when', 'compared', 'best', 'peers', 'early', '2000s', 'top', 'honors', 'going', 'Not', 'Teen', 'Movie', 'oddly', 'proven', 'be', 'rather', 'timeless', 'certainly', 'got', 'enjoyment', 'think', 'others', 'who', 'were', 'high', 'school/college', 'filming', 'New', 'Guy', 'will', 'also', 'be', 'able', 'glean', 'nostalgic', 'value', 'wow', 'wonky', 'soundtrack', 'back', '.Final', 'notes', 'are', 'downright', 'bizarre', 'cameos', 'enjoyed', 'including', 'Vanilla', 'Ice', 'who', 'been', 'driven', 'violence', 'Tony', 'Hawk', 'who', 'desperate', 'show', 'off', 'skateboarding', 'skills', 'nothing', 'else', 'can', 'certainly', 'be', 'said', 'most', 'likely', 'only', 'film', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'Lyle', 'Lovitt', 'take', 'flaming', 'marshmallow', 'eye', 'yes', 'actually']",The New Guy VHS

But now they're just sporadicly released, and I guess that's making them a little better. For The New Guy, although not flashy or star-filled, was an entertaining flick.The story is a twist on the ""fish out of water"" plot with the main character, Dizzy, transcending from ""a blip on the radar screen"" to one of the most mysterious yet undeniably hip students at a high school. His transformation is done by a prison mate who - and I found this weird - could be visited frequently. There were actually a lot of weird plot hole instances in this movie, but they're easily overlooked for the film has a sense of stupidity about it. Which could annoy some, but make it entertaining enough for others.DJ Squalls was perfect for this role, and although not an A-list actor, he handles himself well and has a bit of comic timing. Eddie Griffin is - as always - annoyingly funny, yet his act is toned down here and his humour is felt a bit more than normal. Eliza Dushku carries us through with the lead female, and she's luscious as always.

Most of the jokes fall flat and the situations are clich&eacute;d. In fact, the first half of this film is abysmal. I had already given up on the film being even salvageable until the second half brought in some redemption.Yes, it becomes a little cheesy, but it puts a few twists on the usual storyline. It avoids the usual &quot;rags to riches&quot; template in which the unpopular nerd has something happen and becomes popular and disses his old friends, then everyone finds out his secret and he becomes the same old nerd but now values his old nerdy friends. The New Guy follows the first half of the formula, but then takes a nice departure. Sure it's still on the predictable side, yet it is sweet and uplifting.In fact, it is the charming cast of characters that save this film in the end from a one star fate. DJ Qualls is very likable as the nerd, his friends seem like people you'd want to hang out with in high school, and several cameos are amusing. Also, Lyle Lovett as the nerd's father is quite entertaining.If the jokes were actually funny and the filmmakers toned down the cheese factor at the end, this film would make a good teen film.

707165,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B000069HQ1,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[1, 3]","This was an amiable movie that tries to be as cool as gross-out teen comedies while embracing the ""meaning"" of shows like ""Dawson's Creek"".  DJ Qualls is ""The New Guy"" - Dizzy.  But before he becomes the New Guy of West-Highland High, he's just one of many brutalized nerds at another school (a sure sign that the guys who write these sophomoric rants aren't exactly bowled by the tragedy at Columbine anymore).  After a catastrophic episode of bullying involving Dizzy's genitals and his school's 80 year old librarian, Dizzy manages to get sent to prison, where his love of funk music earns him the odd friendship of Luther (Eddie Griffin).  Released from prison, Dizzy is remade into Gil, with a different hair and clothing style, but still essentially the same guy.  Utterly unknown at his new school, and with the help of the geeky friends that sing funk with him, Dizzy sets out to become the ultimate delinquent, get the girl and conquer the jocks at his new school.  Relying on pluck, but mostly dumb luck, Dizzy/Gil suceeds, or is meant to long enough for his past to come back to haunt him.  In the meantime, his maverick ways energize the school - which hasn't won a football game in 5 years (since the President's father....was president) - to become a focal point of goodness (instead of lions lying down with the lamb, geek and jock coexist without serious injury - to the geek side anyway; and friends who haven't exchanged a word since the gap of coolness became a chasm between them, reunite).Beside from the obligatory sexual suggestions, and forgetting how ""American Pie"" conquered our fear of Columbine, ""New Guy"" is actually a pretty harmless movie.  The story stretches credibility, not with the stunts Dizzy/Gil endures, but by having his new schoolmates prove so utterly gullible to his unimaginative schemes (including one scene where he motivates the team to victory riffing on George C. Scott's ""Patton"" monolog; R. Lee Emerey's DI from ""Full Metal Jacket"" would have been a more daring choice).  The cool groups of Dizzy's new school are so ready to allow Gil into their restricted class, it's not even a class at all.  Despite it's thin story, ""New Guy"" manages to pull of a lot of fun.  Watch for Henry Rollins and Kool Mo Dee as Luther's prison escort, and - for a brief second - Vanilla Ice as a record store employee who thinks he's still working as a bouncer.",3,light fun,1047254400,"03 10, 2003",2003,2393,"['was', 'amiable', 'movie', 'be', 'as', 'cool', 'gross-out', 'teen', 'comedies', 'embracing', 'meaning', 'shows', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'DJ', 'Qualls', 'New', 'Guy', 'Dizzy', 'New', 'Guy', 'West-Highland', 'High', 'just', 'one', 'many', 'brutalized', 'nerds', 'school', 'sure', 'sign', 'guys', 'who', 'write', 'sophomoric', 'rants', 'are', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'bowled', 'tragedy', 'Columbine', 'anymore', 'catastrophic', 'episode', 'bullying', 'involving', 'Dizzy', 'genitals', 'school', '80', 'year', 'old', 'librarian', 'Dizzy', 'get', 'sent', 'prison', 'where', 'love', 'funk', 'music', 'odd', 'friendship', 'Luther', 'Eddie', 'Griffin', 'Released', 'prison', 'Dizzy', 'remade', 'Gil', 'different', 'hair', 'clothing', 'style', 'still', 'essentially', 'same', 'guy', 'Utterly', 'unknown', 'new', 'school', 'help', 'geeky', 'sing', 'funk', 'Dizzy', 'out', 'become', 'ultimate', 'delinquent', 'get', 'girl', 'conquer', 'jocks', 'new', 'school', 'Relying', 'pluck', 'mostly', 'dumb', 'luck', 'Dizzy/Gil', 'meant', 'long', 'enough', 'past', 'come', 'back', 'haunt', 'meantime', 'maverick', 'ways', 'energize', 'school', ""n't"", 'won', 'football', 'game', '5', 'years', 'President', 'father', '.was', 'president', 'become', 'focal', 'point', 'goodness', 'instead', 'lions', 'lying', 'down', 'lamb', 'geek', 'jock', 'coexist', 'serious', 'injury', 'geek', 'side', 'anyway', 'friends', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'exchanged', 'word', 'gap', 'coolness', 'became', 'chasm', 'reunite', '.Beside', 'obligatory', 'sexual', 'suggestions', 'forgetting', 'how', 'American', 'Pie', 'conquered', 'fear', 'Columbine', 'New', 'Guy', 'actually', 'pretty', 'harmless', 'movie', 'story', 'stretches', 'credibility', 'not', 'stunts', 'Dizzy/Gil', 'endures', 'having', 'new', 'schoolmates', 'prove', 'so', 'utterly', 'gullible', 'unimaginative', 'schemes', 'including', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'team', 'victory', 'riffing', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'Patton', 'monolog', 'R.', 'Lee', 'Emerey', 'DI', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Jacket', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'daring', 'choice', 'cool', 'groups', 'Dizzy', 'new', 'school', 'are', 'so', 'ready', 'allow', 'Gil', 'restricted', 'class', 'not', 'even', 'class', 'thin', 'story', 'New', 'Guy', 'pull', 'lot', 'fun', 'Watch', 'Henry', 'Rollins', 'Kool', 'Mo', 'Dee', 'Luther', 'prison', 'escort', 'brief', 'second', 'Vanilla', 'Ice', 'record', 'store', 'employee', 'who', 'still', 'working', 'bouncer']",The New Guy VHS

This movie isn't for you.  You'll probably hate it.Now that those weirdos are gone, let me tell you why I love The New Guy.  This movie isn't very good, and that is its strongest point.  It exists to make fun of teen melodramas with a great assembly of random guest stars, completely mediocre cinematography, some movie mocking moments, and general randomness.  This movie doesn't take itself seriously for a second, and neither should you.

If you can relax, have no expectations, and just let it flow I garentee you'll spend the film doubled over.  It features over the top geeks like a midget tuba player, a couple ugly-pretty girls, a fat black kid, and a greasy haired Asian guy.  The soundtrack adds to every humorous moment by sounding like an Oscar winner meeting a NOW thats what I call music CD.  Most of the guest stars are not big names, but that one guy from that one 80's band or that one tv show.  And they pop up in the most random places, like Lyle Loveitt with a marshmellow burning in his face and Jermiane Dupri's excellent delivery of ""whose the [...] now?"".

707169,A2QQHIY23PL7H3,B000069HQ1,Simon,"[1, 4]","If you enjoy movies in the ""teen melodrama"" genre, The New Guy is actually pretty decent. The story, about a teen who rebuilds his image with the help of a prison inmate, has a constant feel-good vibe to it. The script is occasionally funny with deliberate nods to the cliches of the genre, and is sometimes plain bizzare. DJ Qualls is a likeable lead, without the arrogance of most actors who take these roles. And of course, there's Eliza Dushku, the main reason I saw this movie in the first place. She's beautiful, talented, and her swimsuit montage is definitely the movie's highlight! Hopefully though, she'll find more ambitious projects in the future.So I liked The New Guy, but I still can't recommend it. For the movies few original moments, the rest of the stuff still feels pretty cliched and predictable. Worse than that, the movie is badly filmed, without the lively colors or brightness of She's All That, Bring it On, or American Pie. It has an amateurish look, and this is what really hurts the film. There are many plot holes, like how Qualls and Eddie Griffin can move around so freely in prison. While this might have been a deliberate gag, it feels more like sloppy writing. The gags are simply okay; they're funny to the point where you might find yourself smiling a lot, but few go the extra distance and make you truly laugh out loud.Worse still, the DVD looks like a bare-bones effort. If the DVD had included some good bonus features (com'on, there HAS to be outtakes of Eliza Dushku from the swimsuit scene!), I would have gladly added another star. If more bonus features are revealed later, then consider another star added and my full recommendation to buy, but as it stands the movie by itself is not worth the cost on DVD. If you're an Eliza Dushku fan, like I am, then the movie *is* worth the cost, but ONLY after rigorous price-comparison shopping.This DVD should only be purchased by Eliza Dushku fans, though since the film is moderately fun in a non-sensical way, everyone else should at least give it a rental.",2,I REALLY wish I could recommend this,1026518400,"07 13, 2002",2002,2049,"['enjoy', 'movies', 'teen', 'melodrama', 'genre', 'New', 'Guy', 'actually', 'pretty', 'decent', 'story', 'teen', 'who', 'image', 'help', 'prison', 'inmate', 'constant', 'feel-good', 'vibe', 'script', 'occasionally', 'funny', 'deliberate', 'nods', 'cliches', 'genre', 'sometimes', 'plain', 'bizzare', 'DJ', 'Qualls', 'likeable', 'lead', 'arrogance', 'most', 'actors', 'who', 'take', 'roles', 'course', 'Eliza', 'Dushku', 'main', 'reason', 'saw', 'movie', 'first', 'place', 'beautiful', 'talented', 'swimsuit', 'montage', 'definitely', 'movie', 'highlight', 'Hopefully', ""'ll"", 'find', 'more', 'ambitious', 'projects', 'future.So', 'liked', 'New', 'Guy', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'movies', 'few', 'original', 'moments', 'rest', 'stuff', 'still', 'pretty', 'cliched', 'predictable', 'Worse', 'movie', 'badly', 'filmed', 'lively', 'colors', 'brightness', 'Bring', 'American', 'Pie', 'amateurish', 'look', 'what', 'really', 'film', 'are', 'many', 'plot', 'holes', 'how', 'Qualls', 'Eddie', 'Griffin', 'can', 'move', 'around', 'so', 'freely', 'prison', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'deliberate', 'gag', 'more', 'sloppy', 'writing', 'gags', 'are', 'simply', 'okay', ""'re"", 'funny', 'point', 'where', 'might', 'find', 'smiling', 'lot', 'few', 'go', 'extra', 'distance', 'make', 'truly', 'out', 'loud.Worse', 'still', 'DVD', 'bare-bones', 'effort', 'DVD', 'had', 'included', 'good', 'bonus', 'features', ""com'on"", 'be', 'outtakes', 'Eliza', 'Dushku', 'swimsuit', 'scene', 'would', 'have', 'gladly', 'added', 'star', 'more', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'revealed', 'later', 'then', 'consider', 'star', 'added', 'full', 'recommendation', 'buy', 'movie', 'not', 'worth', 'cost', 'DVD', ""'re"", 'Eliza', 'Dushku', 'fan', 'am', 'then', 'movie', '*is*', 'cost', 'ONLY', 'rigorous', 'price-comparison', 'shopping.This', 'DVD', 'should', 'only', 'be', 'purchased', 'Eliza', 'Dushku', 'fans', 'film', 'moderately', 'fun', 'non-sensical', 'way', 'everyone', 'else', 'should', 'least', 'give', 'rental']",The New Guy VHS

I even liked her in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. So, I rented The New Guy, expecting Eliza Dushku to pretty much be the only good thing about this movie.Boy was I wrong.DJ Qualls is excellent as the teen that starts off as the nerd who seems helpless to stop being victimized and humiliated by his peers in high school and transforms himself into a strong, confident, masterful teenager who can look after himself. Eddie Griffin is great in his role as the scary (but helpful) prison convict who teaches DJ everything he needs to know to survive, succeed, thrive and strike fear into the hearts of his enemies in high school. It's not realistic. It's far too outrageous for that.Quite a few of the techniques that DJ learns wouldn't work in the real world, (like making entire crowds of people flinch when you give them a crazy look) but that's not really what this movie is about! This is one of the ultimate feel good movies! This is a movie about a guy who started off at the bottom of the food chain and made his way to the top!

But beyond that this tale of Rags to Riches fails to impress beyonf that.  The antics of Dizzy Harrison proves to be monotonouse.  I mean the stereo typical bully who girl friend ditches him, the best friends who break apart and than get together in the end.  The fact that he is revealed for what he is in the end and ends up with the girl anyways this is a been there done that re hash of so many things in the past.  Further proof that an origional idea can go so wrong with so many things to steal from out there.If you want an origional comedy that truely satisfyes than go for Super Troopers, but beyond that don't waste your time with this.",2,"Been there done that, got the T-SHirt",1028678400,"08 7, 2002",2002,742,"['THis', 'movie', 'had', 'such', 'potential', 'first', 'half', 'hour', 'ior', 'so', 'actually', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'tale', 'Rags', 'Riches', 'impress', 'beyonf', 'antics', 'Dizzy', 'Harrison', 'be', 'monotonouse', 'mean', 'stereo', 'typical', 'bully', 'who', 'girl', 'friend', 'ditches', 'best', 'friends', 'who', 'break', 'apart', 'get', 'together', 'end', 'fact', 'revealed', 'what', 'end', 'up', 'girl', 'been', 'there', 'done', 're', 'hash', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'past', 'Further', 'proof', 'origional', 'idea', 'can', 'go', 'so', 'wrong', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'steal', 'out', 'there.If', 'want', 'origional', 'comedy', 'truely', 'satisfyes', 'go', 'Super', 'Troopers', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time']",The New Guy VHS

Just the way he looks makes me laugh seriously. This guy is a nerd at the beggining of the movie, then ends up being the cool guy at the end lol. Its funny, all kinds of things happen during the movie to get him where he wants. Definately check this movie out.

If this was an attempt to make a really funny Teen Comedy, heck it failed. The acting is okay, but the theme is really poor which eventually leads to the downside of the entire movie. I mean check this out. A high school kid, is a no-body in his prior school and suddenly becomes a somebody in his new one, by doing really stupid stuff, like poking kids in the eyes,and doing something weird with his own. I really Admire Tony Hawk but his intervention in this movie really has no meaning!
