What would normally have been a  nothing-out-of-the-ordinary funny movie is elevated to unusual height by  the excellent teamplay of the two leads, Martin and Hawn and Cless as the  crossdressing hotel manager. Without ever trying to steal each others show  they each contribute to what must rate as one of the most hiarious movies  ever made.  The story itself, elderly but still youthfull couple has  finally time for each other and they don't really know what to do now is  even preserved throughout the movie and doesn't get lost like it usually  does in comedies.

It's not really funny, with a couple chuckles and smiles here and there, and the actors play characters that you can't help but hate.  Steve Martin is, okay, but  I've seen him in funnier roles.  Goldie Hawn's character was showered with  so much stupidity and idiocy that she became annoying and at times,  unbearable.  John Cleese dancing in drag did nothing for me, and it wasn't  funny.  &quot;The Out of Towners&quot; is not a terrible movie, I just  didn't really care enough about it to make a real judgement.  My friend  liked it and bought it, so I laughed sometimes for his benefit.  I thought  about how much money he spent on it too, $30 to be exact, and thought that  this movie didn't deserve to have that much money shelled out on it.

Steve Martin's version of George Kellerman is lazy and nearly humorless.  It loses sight of the original's comic storyline:  New York kicking this simple Ohio couple's butt at every turn and the couple deciding to go back home.

That's exactly what this movie turns out to be.This is the story of Henry and Nancy Clark (Martin and Hawn, respectively), an Ohio couple who have a son that they've just sent off to study abroad for a year, and a daughter who quit medical school to become an actress in New York.  Henry has just gotten fired from his job at an advertising firm and now he must go to New York City to interview for a job at the only company that's interested in hiring him.  Nancy tags along on the trip, and before you know it, the adventure begins.  They begin by having their plane re-routed to Boston and the airline losing their luggage.  They can't get a bus to New York City, they miss the Amtrak by just a few seconds, and then they get stuck with a rental car with a heater that won't shut off.  They damage their rental car, get mugged by an Andrew Lloyd Webber impersonator, and get kicked out of their hotel.All of that happens in just the first 20 minutes of the movie.  These problems and inconveniences keep mounting, and during the whole time they're looking for food to quell their hunger, a place to rest, and a way to kick-start their stagnant marriage.  Like I already mentioned, this movie is mildly funny, but still not on par with other movies these two actors have made.  Steve Martin is a veteran of these types of comedies, but he's not as good here as he was in movies like ""Father of the Bride"".  He's always been great at playing the well-intentioned goof, but he just doesn't sell it as well here.  Goldie Hawn is an Academy Award winner, but it's clear that her best work is behind her.  She's also been in better movies of this genre.In the grand scheme of things, this movie will probably rank as one of the lesser works on these two actors' resumes.

The answer is... Yes.Steve and Goldie play a Married Couple having an ""Empty Nest"" episode. Their Only Son has Left the House, and they are alone. Goldie takes it harder than Steve does, as Steve has the Loss of his Job on his mind. With a Job Interview in New York, the pair head for the Big Apple, and the film follows their Misadventures through the city that Never Sleeps.""The Out of Towner's"" may not go down in the History books as the Funniest film Ever Made, but it Will Entertain an Undemanding Audience simply looking for a few Laughs. Goldie and Steve make a Great on-screen couple, it's a Real Shame that every time they are Partnered up, they are also partnered with Average Material. The Screenplay is the problem as it quite simply isn't very funny. The jokes have been Recycled from the Original ""Out of Towner's"", nearly Every Other Neil Simon film or play and from a Countless number of latter-day Jack Lemmon / Walter Matthau road movies. Some of the jokes even date back to the Bob Hope / Bing Crosby road movie days. When that starts happening, the screen writer should realise that it's time for a Rewrite or two.Still, It's Goldie and Steve to the rescue, as they Save the film from itself and make it Enjoyable nonetheless. John Cleese chips in here and there as a Snooty Upper-class Hotel Manager with a Penchant for Woman's Clothing. Some will Undoubtable find this role Annoying, Demeaning or just plain Stupid, but others will find it Funny, as I did. The Whole Three of them are called upon to act pretty Silly now and then, but they pull it off.Directing and Technical Credits are Average, nothing special...

Litton,"[0, 0]","Marc Lawrence's script for the remake of &quot;The Out-of-Towners&quot; is not without its flaws, but that doesn't stop it from being a watchable comedy that rides on the performances of its two leads. Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn are two of the most well-enjoyed comedic talents Hollywood has to offer, and they pretty much make the movie surprisingly enjoyable despite some unfunny scenes and a formulaic plot.Henry and Nancy Clark live out their routine lives in Ohio, so it comes as no little surprise that when there only son goes off to college abroad, their lives seem listless and uneventful. Henry has lost his job, but keeps it from Nancy when he is offered a position in an advertising firm in New York. Nancy sees it as the perfect way to spark some romance back into their marriage, and off they go, only to be laid over in Boston, where they must rent an expensive car, finally reaching the big city only to run into more problems.The obstacles, like the primary setup, are pretty basic: they are mugged in the middle of the street, their hotel will not accept their credit card, which is low on funds, which leaves them on the streets trying to think of ways to come up with money for the room. Some of these prove to be quite funny and entertaining, while other scenarios, one of which involves Martin on an overdose of hallucenogenics, seem forced and a bit agonizing for the actors. The laughs seem to die out a bit in the end, but the first two thirds of the film make up for it.Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn are the perfect comedy team for the movie, bringing the laughs on even in places where you least expect it. Martin plays Henry to be very nervous in times of tension, giving his character a goofy and awkward trait that makes him easier to laugh at. Hawn is definitely the smarter of the two, but still retains that little girl quality that makes her performances so superb.

The plane is out-routed, nearly out-sourced, their deluxe rental car has no air conditioning.

At the hotel they are kicked out because their credit card has been overdrawn by their own daughter. And that's only part of the beginning.

Henry Clark (Steve Martin) has an idea that now is the time to leave Iowa and get a higher-paying job in New York.  Actually, he got fired from his weak advertising job and doesn't have the heart to tell his wife, Nancy (Goldie Hawn).So Henry is on his way by airplane to New York.  Could have been an ordinary trip, but Nancy suddenly runs on the airplane to surprise her husband.  She announces that she has brought her husband's rash cream.  That's not all, they can't land in New York City because it is fogged in.  So the plane lands in God-forgotten Boston.And so with that, getting to New York in time for the important job interview is going to be an adventure of its own.  Everything goes wrong.Also in the cast: John Cleese, Mark McKinney, Carlease Burke, Ernie Sabella, James Arone, Chris McKinney, then-Mayor Rudy Giuliani.This movie was filmed and released before the reality TV series, ""Amazing Race"" premiered on Sept. 5, 2001.

468103,A152C8GYY25HAH,6305526052,Matthew Horner,"[13, 15]","Thirty years ago, Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis starred in the original version of The Out of Towners. It was moderately successful with the public and the media. As society changed over time, so did much of what we find humorous. Back then, it was funny when the Beaver disobeyed his parents. Today, much laughter is evoked when an audience sees a kid who does obey. The Beaver would be an outcast, a nerd. We have become enormously more worldly.As was the original, the remake of The Out of Towners is a comedy about a series of mishaps that befall a naive Ohio couple when they venture to New York City. Their plane is rerouted to Boston. They fail to catch a train from there to the Big Apple. Then they rent a car, which they wreck minutes after arriving in Manhattan. Things go downhill from there.This unfortunate pair is Harry and Nancy Clark, played by Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn. Both stars give it their all, but they are no match for the way Lemmon and Dennis portrayed the couple. Hawn and Martin are comedians whose success depends on the material they are given to work with. [This is why Martin excels in movies he writes and/or directs.] Dennis and Lemmon were serious actors who can cross over into comedy. What was so funny in the original was the way the two took the mishaps so seriously. They looked and acted like an innocent Midwestern pair. Martin and Hawn come off as too glib and sophisticated to ever have such events happen to them.The movie has its moments, especially when Martin is seemingly allowed to ad-lib. His scene in Central Park, where he winds up after accidentally taking a hallucinogenic drug, is priceless. The incredible Englishman, John Cleese, has his moments as an ultra-snobbish hotel manager.Perhaps the major problem with The Out of Towners is that the story is dated in ways no rewrite could fix. New York has changed dramatically. I find much of it to be safer and friendlier than many other big cities. Times Square, once the haunt of panhandlers and prostitutes, now seems about as dangerous as Disneyland. Harry Clark is successful in the advertising business, and Nancy was once his partner, Jetting from place to place is the norm for such professionals these days, and it no longer makes sense that he hasn't been to New York before.

Almost thirty years later, here is a remake, with Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn playing the title characters. This remake from '99 was not bad (I rented it from Netflix), and Martin and Hawn were funny (I thought they were wonderful, and they are excellent actors), and this version was funny in general, but I felt that it wouldn't hold a candle to the 1970 movie. Martin and Hawn's characters go through similar mishaps like the characters from the original, but there are a few twists to the remake: the hotel manager is secretly seen wearing a woman's sable fur coat and a freaky looking cap while dancing and lip-syncing to the Donna Summer hit, Bad Girls, a vicious dog that lives in an apartment goes charging after the couple, to where the couple mistakenly walk into a group therapy meeting overhearing a man talk about masturbation, etc. Sure, this '99 version is funny to a degree, but I think the Lemmon and Dennis version from '70 is funnier. I feel that when a certain movie is remade years later after an original, the remake probably won't be as popular and maybe not well-received as the original was.

However, typical liberal Hollywood has to interject its craziness into the plot. For example, two middle aged married Ohioans are not going to show up in NYC and have sex in a garden to get caught by people dedicating a statue in the garden and chased by the police. They are also not going to blackmail a transvestite to get a free room. They are not going to steal a meal from a guy looking to pick up a ""date"" at a hotel bar. Too much of a ""coincidence"" that they try and crash a sexaholics meeting for the free food, only to spend their first stolen dollars on a cab ride the next. It isn't that ""middle Americans"" as everyone outside of LA and NYC and SF are derogatorily referred to, and in this movie depicted as ""Ohioans"", don't have survival instincts or that all ""other"" Americans are Apple pie church going folk . . . it is that most know that is wrong and live a true right and wrong life like most outside of SF, LA, and NYC. That just wouldn't make for a ""fun"" movie. So Hollywood has to interject this as it is blinded by its moral corruption and a dry well of imagination. It clearly isn't for comedy. Anyway there are some redeeming qualities to this film (the husband and wife strangely get closer by actually sharing their lives again . . . being partners again . . . only after . . . oh wanting to call their marriage quits about 3 different times) but over all it is just a seen that heard that film that seems to be made only to give two aging Hollywood stars another film to ""star"" in.
