243699,AJNFCL2IC72JU,6301031350,ADK,"[26, 27]","I First learned of this film as an accidental find at the local video rental shop in the foriegn film section. Now it's a top ten favorite film of mine for several reasons.Stealthily made for Georgian/Russian television under Soviet era rule, it was ""shelved"" until 1986 when glasnost allowed it's release, just a couple of years prior to the breakup of the Soviet Union. Anyway, here it's shown in Fullscreen presentation as it was made, hence there is no such thing as a Widescreen version.Running time is complete (unedited) at about 154 minutes.Repentance is a story within a story(three generations) which is also book-ended by a main charachter's brief musings leaving the viewer to wonder was this a momentary daydream or did all this actually happen? This does not give away the story or any suspense whatsoever.Because of the multi-layered story, multiple charachters and involved plot most viewers including Georgian/Russian literates will be a bit lost on first viewing. So far I've watched it perhaps 9 or 10 times over the last decade and I'm still unraveling much of the story, charachters and dialogue. Now that I have it on DVD it will be viewed and disected over and over.It's a complicated blend of social commentary, political nightmare, spiritual awareness, family disintegration, artistic/human freedom, surrealism, and even brief moments of (black)comedy.The film's overall flow is like a dark drama and part Euro artfilm perhaps due to the surreal scenes and the unrushed filming/editing. This is not Hollywood product!There's realy little or no ""action"" per se, and despite there being no blatant visual violence (or sex) I always leave this film as though I've lived through a mass of brutality and executions. Repentance carries some obvious political messages but it really asks the viewer to draw thier own conclusions and to think for thyself!The RUSCICO DVD version is an excellent package. The colors and quality are as good as the origial film will allow. There are several excellent and revelant extras as well as subtitles for nearly any language known to man.Unfortunatly it was never released in it's original Georgian soundtrack. All three languages here are dubbed. The Georgian soundtrack is actualy the original Russian dub with a Georgian translator reading over that.I watch it with english subtitles while listening to the original release Russian dub.For a dollar more than the domestic release I bought the ""Pokaianie"" version which is region-free and has the Russian printed cover. I suspect other that these two things it is identical to the ""Repentance"" region 1 version.For the real diehard enthusists there is a companion book in the ""Film Companion "" series which is a study guide/scene disection but it's not really a revealing or behind the scenes reader.A fantastic, dark and thoughtful film that is as relevant and timeless as the viewer allows or chooses it to be.",5,"Haunting, harrowing, intellectual, visual masterwork.",1097107200,"10 7, 2004",2004,2920,"['First', 'learned', 'film', 'accidental', 'find', 'local', 'video', 'rental', 'shop', 'foriegn', 'film', 'section', 'Now', 'top', 'ten', 'favorite', 'film', 'mine', 'several', 'reasons.Stealthily', 'made', 'Georgian/Russian', 'television', 'Soviet', 'era', 'rule', 'was', 'shelved', '1986', 'when', 'glasnost', 'allowed', 'release', 'just', 'couple', 'years', 'prior', 'breakup', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'Anyway', 'here', 'shown', 'Fullscreen', 'presentation', 'was', 'made', 'hence', 'such', 'thing', 'Widescreen', 'version.Running', 'time', 'complete', 'unedited', 'about', '154', 'minutes.Repentance', 'story', 'story', 'three', 'generations', 'also', 'book-ended', 'main', 'charachter', 'brief', 'musings', 'leaving', 'viewer', 'wonder', 'was', 'momentary', 'daydream', 'did', 'actually', 'happen', 'not', 'give', 'away', 'story', 'suspense', 'whatsoever.Because', 'multi-layered', 'story', 'multiple', 'charachters', 'involved', 'plot', 'most', 'viewers', 'including', 'Georgian/Russian', 'literates', 'will', 'be', 'bit', 'lost', 'first', 'viewing', 'far', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'perhaps', '9', '10', 'times', 'last', 'decade', ""'m"", 'still', 'unraveling', 'much', 'story', 'charachters', 'dialogue', 'Now', 'have', 'DVD', 'will', 'be', 'viewed', 'disected', 'complicated', 'blend', 'social', 'commentary', 'political', 'nightmare', 'spiritual', 'awareness', 'family', 'disintegration', 'artistic/human', 'freedom', 'surrealism', 'even', 'brief', 'moments', 'black', 'comedy.The', 'film', 'overall', 'flow', 'dark', 'drama', 'part', 'Euro', 'artfilm', 'perhaps', 'due', 'surreal', 'scenes', 'unrushed', 'filming/editing', 'not', 'Hollywood', 'product', 'realy', 'little', 'action', 'se', 'being', 'blatant', 'visual', 'violence', 'sex', 'always', 'leave', 'film', ""'ve"", 'lived', 'mass', 'brutality', 'executions', 'Repentance', 'obvious', 'political', 'messages', 'really', 'viewer', 'draw', 'thier', 'own', 'conclusions', 'think', 'thyself', 'RUSCICO', 'DVD', 'version', 'excellent', 'package', 'colors', 'quality', 'are', 'as', 'good', 'origial', 'film', 'will', 'allow', 'are', 'several', 'excellent', 'revelant', 'extras', 'as', 'well', 'subtitles', 'nearly', 'language', 'known', 'man.Unfortunatly', 'was', 'never', 'released', 'original', 'Georgian', 'soundtrack', 'three', 'languages', 'here', 'are', 'dubbed', 'Georgian', 'soundtrack', 'original', 'Russian', 'dub', 'Georgian', 'translator', 'reading', 'that.I', 'watch', 'english', 'subtitles', 'listening', 'original', 'release', 'Russian', 'dollar', 'more', 'domestic', 'release', 'bought', 'Pokaianie', 'version', 'region-free', 'Russian', 'printed', 'cover', 'suspect', 'other', 'two', 'things', 'identical', 'Repentance', 'region', '1', 'real', 'diehard', 'enthusists', 'companion', 'book', 'Film', 'Companion', 'series', 'study', 'guide/scene', 'disection', 'not', 'really', 'revealing', 'scenes', 'reader.A', 'fantastic', 'dark', 'thoughtful', 'film', 'relevant', 'timeless', 'viewer', 'be']",Repentance VHS

It's a bizarre story of 2 generations of small town despots, and the revenge of a woman who's parents were tortured and executed...guilt is a central theme, and I love what Abel says to himself when his shame finally overcomes him, &quot;...may your blood turn to water, and your bread to dust&quot;.The twist ending might give your brain a spin...was it all in her imagination ? was it an alternate reality ? it's up to you to decide...I've seen this film countless times, and never tire of it.

243701,A2SLA0SXRQV8M0,6301031350,Andres C. Salama,"[0, 0]","When in Soviet Georgia a woman named Keto is arrested for digging up the remains of Valam, the long time mayor of a small town, she defends herself recalling the terror created by the mayor when she was a child. Valam (played by Avtandil Makharadze) has a Hitler moustache but is clearly based on Lavrenti Beria, who before being head of the Soviet security services, was the top leader in Georgia, and under whose rule the worst part of the great purges happened (Beria was known for its particular cruelty).  Keto&#8217;s father was the painter Sandro Barateli (played by Edisher Giorgiobani, a redhead who looks like Vincent Van Gogh) who was arrested by Valam after he tried to protest the destruction of an ancient church (regarding the name, it might be worth noting that one notable victim of Beria was the theater director Sandro Akhmeteli).This might be the most anti-communist film ever made in the Soviet Union, though its aesthetics are very much in the Soviet tradition of the Brezhnev era. I might be wrong, but I think this was the first time a Soviet film touched on the issue of the Stalinist &#8220;repressions&#8221;. In a touching moment, Keto declares on the stand that such actions cannot be forgiven (this was filmed during a period in history where the repressions were hardly mentioned at the official press). It&#8217;s amazing this film was even made. It was released in 1987 to wide acclaim after being shelved for several years. The movie goes beyond criticizing the &#8220;excesses&#8221; of Stalinism, but goes on to attack the heart of the Soviet system. On the minus side, the movie is sometimes overwrought and has a lot of surreal, bizarre touches, that are not always successful. And at around two hours and a half, the film is also too long, with parts that are a bit of a struggle.",3,Landmark film is not without flaws,1397606400,"04 16, 2014",2014,1819,"['When', 'Soviet', 'Georgia', 'woman', 'named', 'Keto', 'arrested', 'digging', 'up', 'remains', 'Valam', 'long', 'time', 'mayor', 'small', 'town', 'recalling', 'terror', 'created', 'mayor', 'when', 'was', 'child', 'Valam', 'played', 'Avtandil', 'Makharadze', 'Hitler', 'moustache', 'clearly', 'based', 'Lavrenti', 'Beria', 'who', 'being', 'head', 'Soviet', 'security', 'services', 'was', 'top', 'leader', 'Georgia', 'rule', 'worst', 'part', 'great', 'purges', 'happened', 'Beria', 'was', 'known', 'particular', 'cruelty', 'Keto', '8217', 'father', 'was', 'painter', 'Sandro', 'Barateli', 'played', 'Edisher', 'Giorgiobani', 'redhead', 'who', 'Vincent', 'Van', 'Gogh', 'who', 'was', 'arrested', 'Valam', 'tried', 'protest', 'destruction', 'ancient', 'church', 'regarding', 'name', 'might', 'be', 'worth', 'noting', 'one', 'notable', 'victim', 'Beria', 'was', 'theater', 'director', 'Sandro', 'Akhmeteli', '.This', 'might', 'be', 'most', 'anti-communist', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'aesthetics', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'Soviet', 'tradition', 'Brezhnev', 'era', 'might', 'be', 'wrong', 'think', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'Soviet', 'film', 'touched', 'issue', 'Stalinist', '8220', 'repressions', '8221', 'touching', 'moment', 'Keto', 'stand', 'such', 'actions', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'forgiven', 'was', 'filmed', 'period', 'history', 'where', 'repressions', 'were', 'hardly', 'mentioned', 'official', 'press', '8217', 'amazing', 'film', 'was', 'even', 'made', 'was', 'released', '1987', 'wide', 'acclaim', 'being', 'shelved', 'several', 'years', 'movie', 'criticizing', '8220', '8221', 'Stalinism', 'attack', 'heart', 'Soviet', 'system', 'minus', 'side', 'movie', 'sometimes', 'overwrought', 'lot', 'surreal', 'bizarre', 'touches', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'successful', 'two', 'hours', 'half', 'film', 'also', 'too', 'long', 'parts', 'are', 'bit', 'struggle']",Repentance VHS

243703,AEJ51LB0XGGY,6301031350,"Jaroslav Melgr ""jaroski""","[2, 2]","This is a fabulous movie made in Soviet-controlled Georgia. It was made in 1984, which given the subject is in itself an Orwellian overtone. The film shows the impact of atheism on a society, portrays how various people dealt with it and examines the conscience of unconscionable tyrants and their benefactors.No matter how ruthless and senseless the tyrant, in the end none of them could escape their own conscience, let alone death. While in their paranoia they were able to get rid of class and personal enemies. But in the end, no matter how rich and powerful they could not get rid of the burden of their own guilt.  It also delves into the conscience of the children and grandchildren of tyrants brought up in a sheltered and protected environment  -- some of them eventually forced to confront the reality of their special status. This is some heavy stuff.  Some of the allusions made in the movie may be difficult to understand for people who did not grow up behind the iron curtain. But the film's story line, artistic portrayal and visual effects have much to offer to anyone.I first saw this movie in the late 80's in Czechoslovakia and was completely taken back by it. First of all, it was simply incredible that such a film was even allowed to be made in USSR. Second, it is such a profound condemnation of communism that it's hardly believable that it was being shown. This is a credit to Gorbachev and his Glasnost; being willing to let critical voices be heard. And this film is critical in no uncertain terms.The film starts in post-Stalinist era, in a relatively ""moderate"" times in Georgia - which was then part of USSR. The occasion is a funeral of a town's mayor, a great man whose loss is greatly lamented. The late mayor's son is predictably a man of importance himself, a position gained through his father's influence. The son's family wakes up the day after the funeral and to their horror they find that someone has dug up the deceased mayor and placed the corpse in the family's garden. He is re-buried, but the whole scenario repeats for several nights until the perpetrator is caught and put on trial. To everyone's surprise, it's not a thug, but a lady who grew up with the mayor's son but whose childhood, life and family were destroyed by the mayor in the name of ""protecting the people.""From that point, the movie goes back in time as the accused woman tells her life story in court in her defense. Not to be a plot spoiler I will stop right here and let you see the rest for yourself. It is truly one of the most remarkable films, most certainly worth seeing if you're interested in this topic.",5,There is no escape from one's conscience,1309824000,"07 5, 2011",2011,2629,"['fabulous', 'movie', 'made', 'Soviet-controlled', 'Georgia', 'was', 'made', '1984', 'given', 'subject', 'Orwellian', 'overtone', 'film', 'impact', 'atheism', 'society', 'how', 'various', 'people', 'dealt', 'conscience', 'unconscionable', 'tyrants', 'benefactors.No', 'matter', 'how', 'ruthless', 'senseless', 'tyrant', 'end', 'none', 'could', 'escape', 'own', 'conscience', 'let', 'alone', 'death', 'paranoia', 'were', 'able', 'get', 'rid', 'class', 'personal', 'enemies', 'end', 'matter', 'how', 'rich', 'powerful', 'could', 'not', 'get', 'rid', 'burden', 'own', 'guilt', 'also', 'conscience', 'children', 'grandchildren', 'tyrants', 'brought', 'up', 'sheltered', 'protected', 'environment', 'eventually', 'forced', 'confront', 'reality', 'special', 'status', 'heavy', 'stuff', 'allusions', 'made', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'difficult', 'understand', 'people', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'grow', 'up', 'iron', 'curtain', 'film', 'story', 'line', 'artistic', 'portrayal', 'visual', 'effects', 'have', 'much', 'offer', 'anyone.I', 'first', 'saw', 'movie', 'late', '80', 'Czechoslovakia', 'was', 'completely', 'taken', 'back', 'First', 'all', 'was', 'simply', 'incredible', 'film', 'was', 'even', 'allowed', 'be', 'made', 'USSR', 'Second', 'such', 'profound', 'condemnation', 'communism', 'hardly', 'believable', 'was', 'being', 'shown', 'credit', 'Gorbachev', 'Glasnost', 'being', 'willing', 'let', 'critical', 'voices', 'be', 'heard', 'film', 'critical', 'uncertain', 'terms.The', 'film', 'post-Stalinist', 'era', 'relatively', 'moderate', 'times', 'Georgia', 'was', 'then', 'part', 'USSR', 'occasion', 'funeral', 'town', 'mayor', 'great', 'man', 'loss', 'greatly', 'lamented', 'late', 'mayor', 'son', 'predictably', 'man', 'importance', 'position', 'gained', 'father', 'influence', 'son', 'family', 'up', 'day', 'funeral', 'horror', 'find', 'someone', 'dug', 'up', 'deceased', 'mayor', 'placed', 'corpse', 'family', 'garden', 're-buried', 'whole', 'scenario', 'repeats', 'several', 'nights', 'perpetrator', 'caught', 'put', 'trial', 'everyone', 'surprise', 'not', 'thug', 'lady', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'mayor', 'son', 'childhood', 'life', 'family', 'were', 'destroyed', 'mayor', 'name', 'protecting', 'people', 'point', 'movie', 'back', 'time', 'accused', 'woman', 'life', 'story', 'court', 'defense', 'Not', 'be', 'plot', 'spoiler', 'will', 'stop', 'right', 'here', 'let', 'see', 'rest', 'truly', 'one', 'most', 'remarkable', 'films', 'most', 'certainly', 'worth', 'seeing', ""'re"", 'interested', 'topic']",Repentance VHS

Gordon,"[0, 0]","A striking (and politically astonishing for it's day) act of self-examination, self-criticism and ultimately self-laceration of a film made in the Soviet Union.This is a darkly funny, playfully surrealistic, scathing satire of the Stalinist era's turning the entire population of an empire into suspects to be jailed, exiled and eliminated at whim. Full of striking images and strong performances.Told in flashback, it starts from the death of a seemingly beloved small town mayor who we come to learn played the role of a local Stalin. Likable and even playful on the surface, the more we see his ever growing darkness the more disturbing the film becomes, as he ever more readily destroys those who might be enemies, or are simply inconvenient.This flashback tale is framed by watching his family, after his death, trying to deal with their own feelings of and denials of guilt, as a local woman, her life ruined by the mayor, stands trial for repeatedly digging up his corpse again and again.Far from a perfect film, some of the surrealistic imagery works better than others, and some twists seem a bit like 'easy' explanations of complex behavior, but this is still a fascinating, challenging and unique film about one of the great horrors of the last century.
