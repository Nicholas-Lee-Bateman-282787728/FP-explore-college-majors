Charles Bickford was very good as ""Pop Warner,"" Thorpe's dedicated coach and a famous sports figure in his own right. Phyllis Thaxter was wholesomely attractive as Jim's wife.None of the leading actors who were Native Americans, as Thorpe was, are played by actual Indians but that's classic-era Hollywood.

308278,A2K4QGL066S2T4,6302344883,Hg Wells,"[2, 2]","Whether to rate this 4 or 5 stars is a little difficult. The story is easily 5 stars. There may have been some room for improvement in the production by today's standards. But, the movie tells the story and tells it well nonetheless. It is an important movie more than simply a good movie since it keeps the story of a truly great athlete alive. There may be a tendency for some to rate this lower simply because of the sadness of the story. And I feel comments on casting white actors to play native Americans are unfair since it judges the past by the changed politically correct standards of today. In spite of all that, without this movie, many people today would have no understanding of this remarkable athlete. The injustice of the movie is also a reminder of how seemingly small decisions we all make can affect lives forever. Jim Thorpe alone did not suffer from such injustice. Many others, Native American or not, have also suffered. And today, as we watch, we also suffer from what was a bad decision by a handful of people.I show this movie to young people whenever I can to keep the dream and the story of who should be the greatest athlete of the century alive. I believe everyone should have this movie around to loan out for just such a purpose. Although Burt Lancaster does not look like Jim Thorpe, I still feel his performance was good. And I think more people watched this because he was in it. Charles Bickford was also very good. Because of such casting, which resulted in more seeing it especially in its earlier years, I feel more have been exposed to this story.I recommend this movie, but especially the story that it tells.

But with that said, do yourself a favor and see it.Jim Thorpe - All American is a fascinating look at a period of American history (the early 20th century) that doesn't get enough coverage.  Thorpe was born just before the death of the Old West (1887 or 88), was an All American college football player at the Carlisle Indian School, won gold medals in the 1912 Stockholm Olympics, played Major League Baseball before WWI, was a founding presence as an all-star halfback in the early National Football League (and its first commissioner), and went on to a long career as a bit player in such Hollywood films as King Kong and White Heat.  On the darker side, over half of his brothers and sisters died in childhood, he was an orphan before 18, his first son (Jim Junior) died at age 2 from pneumonia, he had poor financial habits, wasn't much of a team player, moved around incessantly, had problems with alcohol and tobacco, two wives left him, and he died in poverty.Director Michael (Casablanca) Curtiz does a wonderful job of keeping the campy 50s to a minimum while moving Thorpe's whirlwind life forward on screen.  The real strengths of the film (beyond the historical subject matter) are the wonderful nascent images of early sporting events: the college lettermen's sweaters, old track shoes, baseball uniforms, leather football helmets, etc.  Lancaster was quite fit and looks the part of a young athlete very well.  He is perhaps best when portraying Thorpe's dark decline; these scenes foreshadow De Niro in Scorsese's Raging Bull.  And finally, the scenes from the opening ceremonies of the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles look so real I am sure that Curtiz must have cut actual footage into the film, including an aerial flyover and a speech by then vice-president Charles Curtis (these would have been the first Olympics after the widespread proliferation of sound video recording, in the vibrant young city which created it).All in all Jim Thorpe - All American is a fine cinematic achievement; this is what movie-making is all about.",5,4 1/4 stars for a great slice of american history,1085270400,"05 23, 2004",2004,2235,"['film', 'certainly', 'limits', 'none', 'performances', 'are', 'overwhelmingly', 'good', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'white', 'people', 'playing', 'natives', 'story', 'sometimes', 'borders', 'formulaic', 'said', 'do', 'favor', 'see', 'it.Jim', 'Thorpe', 'American', 'fascinating', 'look', 'period', 'American', 'history', 'early', '20th', 'century', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'coverage', 'Thorpe', 'was', 'born', 'just', 'death', 'Old', 'West', '1887', '88', 'was', 'All', 'American', 'college', 'football', 'player', 'Carlisle', 'Indian', 'School', 'won', 'gold', 'medals', '1912', 'Stockholm', 'Olympics', 'played', 'Major', 'League', 'Baseball', 'WWI', 'was', 'founding', 'presence', 'all-star', 'halfback', 'early', 'National', 'Football', 'League', 'first', 'commissioner', 'went', 'long', 'career', 'bit', 'player', 'such', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'King', 'Kong', 'White', 'Heat', 'darker', 'side', 'half', 'brothers', 'sisters', 'died', 'childhood', 'was', 'orphan', 'before', '18', 'first', 'son', 'Jim', 'Junior', 'died', 'age', '2', 'pneumonia', 'had', 'poor', 'financial', 'habits', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'team', 'player', 'moved', 'around', 'incessantly', 'had', 'problems', 'alcohol', 'tobacco', 'two', 'wives', 'left', 'died', 'poverty.Director', 'Michael', 'Casablanca', 'Curtiz', 'wonderful', 'job', 'keeping', 'campy', '50s', 'minimum', 'moving', 'Thorpe', 'whirlwind', 'life', 'forward', 'screen', 'real', 'strengths', 'film', 'historical', 'subject', 'matter', 'are', 'wonderful', 'nascent', 'images', 'early', 'sporting', 'events', 'college', 'lettermen', 'sweaters', 'old', 'track', 'shoes', 'baseball', 'uniforms', 'leather', 'football', 'helmets', 'etc', 'Lancaster', 'was', 'quite', 'fit', 'part', 'young', 'athlete', 'very', 'well', 'perhaps', 'best', 'when', 'portraying', 'Thorpe', 'dark', 'decline', 'scenes', 'foreshadow', 'De', 'Niro', 'Scorsese', 'Raging', 'Bull', 'finally', 'scenes', 'opening', 'ceremonies', '1932', 'Summer', 'Olympics', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'look', 'so', 'real', 'am', 'sure', 'Curtiz', 'must', 'have', 'cut', 'actual', 'footage', 'film', 'including', 'aerial', 'flyover', 'speech', 'then', 'vice-president', 'Charles', 'Curtis', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'first', 'Olympics', 'widespread', 'proliferation', 'sound', 'video', 'recording', 'vibrant', 'young', 'city', 'created', 'Jim', 'Thorpe', 'American', 'fine', 'cinematic', 'achievement', 'what', 'movie-making']",N/A

The king gave him a special memento and said ""Sir, you are the greatest athlete in the world"" To which the humble Jim Thorpe replied ""Thanks, King"".Now I want to say that there are some unforgettable scenes and performances in this film. The film is simply great entertainment, but 'Casablanca"" director Michael Curtiz along with Max Steiner's musical score take a decidedly ""dark side"" to  the telling of this semi=biographical drama.The overall impression that your receive of this story is the rise of a great sports god who is handled in a tough way by the world and in an attempt to prove his worth is stymied by unfortunate incidents. We are left with the impression that Jim is abandoned by his wife and the overwhelming effect on his marriage and life due to the death of his young son in the ensuing years wherein he sinks to drink and bitterness. In a way it tends to enforce the stereotypes of the dangers of Alcohol and other elements common in those days meant to be derogatory in nature.Actually Jim was married to three different women over the course of his life and had plenty of children. We are also given the impression that he did not get any real coaching jobs but continued to play football until he became too old to compete. In reality, he did coach and his play, although extended, was mostly very productive.  His young son in the first marriage died due to the Influenza epidemic that was killing millions back then and was not really much of an exception that the film tends to portray.The positive elements are ""Pop"" Warner, the utilization of the ""flashback"" technique and a wonderful period of the education of Thorpe at the Carlisle PA Indian School. His introduction to the game of  football is funny and Jim quickly learns that football is the way to get girls. The scenes of football victories are brilliant and the Olympic moments are perhaps the highlight of the movie. Overall Burt Lancaster gives a credible performance and I would recommend this picture as a good one to see with your boys if they are patient watching Black and White films which I understand is a problem of today's world in getting our kids to see and appreciate them. Boy what they are missing!If you are in the area above Allentown, Pennsylvania, be sure to stop and do honor to the resting place of the world's finest athlete.

308283,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,6302344883,Martin Asiner,"[20, 22]","JIM THORPE, ALL AMERICAN is based on the autobiography of the same name, and in the hands of director Michael Curtiz, Thorpe, as played by the athletic Burt Lancaster, comes across as a man beset by a multitude of demons. The film begins with Thorpe as a boy living on an Indian reservation. He runs constantly, almost as if he were trying to outrun the bitter dregs of an anti-Indian racism that he saw as dogging his heels for his entire life. He grows to maturity and attends the Carlisle Indian School on a track scholarship. Much of the film focuses on Thorpe's obvious athletic skills and as long as it does so, Lancaster manages to imbue his character with the pathos of a tragedy that would not disappear. One of the most memorable scenes in a film filled with them (not all of them pleasant) is the one in which he has just arrived as a freshman at Carlisle. He is dressed in his best clothes and shoes, and then suddenly,he is filled with the need to run. He does run, right over and through Carlisle's track team. The track coach looks at his assistant and tells him, ""Find out who that is and bring him here."" His first years at Carlisle show a relaxed Thorpe. He meets his future wife played by Phyllis Thaxter and excells at every sport of the school. Paradoxically,however, the more success that Thorpe achieves, the more is in unable to handle it. His reaction to fame is colored by his previous reaction to racism. He grows bitter and anti-social. He fails to understand that amateur athletics does not involve money nor does he see that his wife loves him and would continue to do so until his increasing world hate drowns out all else. Thorpe's anger at having his Olympic medals taken away simply justifies his own self-destruction. As the film moves toward the end, it becomes painful to watch a proud and skilled student-athlete inch closer to a self-imposed ostracism from those who truly want to understand and to help.

308286,A3GLF9XK4AUAHS,6302344883,Robert E. Nylund,"[6, 6]","The title ""All-American"" was rarely applied to one who truly was an American and was one of the greatest athletes of all time.  Jim Thorpe was a Native American, often called an Indian because of Columbus' original mistake that the natives he encountered in the New World were residents of India, not an entirely new and unknown land.  This remarkable 1951 film was one of the rare looks at a Native American who not only earned the title ""All-American"" but built a reputation as an outstanding athlete.  The film makes it clear, too, that he was successful in every sport he tried, often amazing those who thought they knew him.Early in the film we see a young Jim running away from school because he doesn't want to go the white man's school.  The fact that he runs many miles to go back home, after his father had taken him to school in a horse-drawn wagon.  His father then explains why school is important, particularly if Jim is ever to rise above a very lowly and disadvantaged life on the reservation in Oklahoma.  Jim's father hopes that Jim will do more than he accomplished.  Not only does Jim return to school, he eventually goes on to the famed Carlisle Indian School, a virtual college which achieved a very fine reputation both in academics and athletics.  The famed ""Pop"" Warner, portrayed in the film by Charles Bickford, is shown producing some very fine teams and challenging the more reputable, established colleges and universities of his time.""Pop"" Warner becomes Jim's lifelong mentor.  The film actually begins with the coach's tribute to Jim at a latter day banquet in honor of the amazing athlete.  Director Michael Curtiz intercuts actual footage of the banquet, much as he later uses footage of the real Jim Thorpe (seen from a distance) at the 1912 Olympics and in various games.  Eventually we see footage of the opening of the 1932 Olympics in Los Angeles, including the speech by the Vice President of the United States, whom Coach Warner acknowledges is, like Jim, a Native American, except he uses the word ""Indian.""  Curtiz combines the hisoric footage with shots of Burt Lancaster and Charles Bickford sitting in the Coliseum, which was later used in the 1984 Olympics.The film is a virtual ""rise and fall.""  Jim achieved so much in sports, eventually winning both the Pentathlon and the Decathlon at the 1912 Olympics.  Then it was discovered he had played on a professional team one summer to earn a little money.  For many years professional athletes were banned from competing in the Olympics; the International Olympic Committee was as vigilant in barring professional athletes as it has become in detecting performance-enhancing drugs, such as steroids.  Jim had natural ability, of course, and he had great endurance.  Yet he was stripped of his medals and it was many, many years before his medals were finally returned to his family, long after Jim's death, prompting Burt Lancaster's bitter complaints (cited above).  Jim struggled for years, as we see in the film, and, although he apparently never was financially successful, he at least lived long enough to receive some recognition for his athletic achievemtns.The film was shot in black and white at a time when more and more films were being filmed in color; presumably, the use of monochrome film was because of the inclusion of the vintage, historic footage.  Yet it remains an engrossing story and is enhanced by Michael Curtiz's expertise (as he neared the end of his long tenure at Warner Brothers) and a very fine musical score by another veteran, Austrian-born composer Max Steiner (best known for the music for ""King Kong,"" ""Gone With The Wind,"" and ""Casablanca"").Hopefully, Warner Brothers will soon release the film to DVD.  It has already been shown on Turner Classic Movies and is clearly yet another top-notch production from the Burbank studio.",4,A True American,1156377600,"08 24, 2006",2006,3860,"['title', 'All-American', 'was', 'rarely', 'applied', 'one', 'who', 'truly', 'was', 'American', 'was', 'one', 'greatest', 'athletes', 'time', 'Jim', 'Thorpe', 'was', 'Native', 'American', 'often', 'called', 'Indian', 'Columbus', 'original', 'mistake', 'natives', 'encountered', 'New', 'World', 'were', 'residents', 'India', 'not', 'entirely', 'new', 'unknown', 'land', 'remarkable', '1951', 'film', 'was', 'one', 'rare', 'Native', 'American', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'earned', 'title', 'All-American', 'built', 'reputation', 'outstanding', 'athlete', 'film', 'clear', 'too', 'was', 'successful', 'sport', 'tried', 'often', 'amazing', 'who', 'thought', 'knew', 'him.Early', 'film', 'see', 'young', 'Jim', 'running', 'away', 'school', ""n't"", 'want', 'go', 'white', 'man', 'school', 'fact', 'many', 'miles', 'go', 'back', 'home', 'father', 'had', 'taken', 'school', 'horse-drawn', 'wagon', 'father', 'then', 'why', 'school', 'important', 'particularly', 'Jim', 'ever', 'rise', 'very', 'lowly', 'disadvantaged', 'life', 'reservation', 'Oklahoma', 'Jim', 'father', 'Jim', 'will', 'do', 'more', 'accomplished', 'Not', 'only', 'Jim', 'return', 'school', 'eventually', 'famed', 'Carlisle', 'Indian', 'School', 'virtual', 'college', 'achieved', 'very', 'fine', 'reputation', 'academics', 'athletics', 'famed', 'Pop', 'Warner', 'portrayed', 'film', 'Charles', 'Bickford', 'shown', 'producing', 'very', 'fine', 'teams', 'challenging', 'more', 'reputable', 'established', 'colleges', 'universities', 'time', 'Pop', 'Warner', 'Jim', 'lifelong', 'mentor', 'film', 'actually', 'coach', 'tribute', 'Jim', 'latter', 'day', 'banquet', 'honor', 'amazing', 'athlete', 'Director', 'Michael', 'Curtiz', 'actual', 'footage', 'banquet', 'much', 'later', 'footage', 'real', 'Jim', 'Thorpe', 'seen', 'distance', '1912', 'Olympics', 'various', 'games', 'Eventually', 'see', 'footage', 'opening', '1932', 'Olympics', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'including', 'speech', 'Vice', 'President', 'United', 'States', 'whom', 'Coach', 'Warner', 'Jim', 'Native', 'American', 'word', 'Indian', 'Curtiz', 'hisoric', 'footage', 'shots', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'Charles', 'Bickford', 'sitting', 'Coliseum', 'was', 'later', 'used', '1984', 'Olympics.The', 'film', 'virtual', 'rise', 'fall', 'Jim', 'achieved', 'so', 'much', 'sports', 'eventually', 'winning', 'Pentathlon', 'Decathlon', '1912', 'Olympics', 'Then', 'was', 'discovered', 'had', 'played', 'professional', 'team', 'one', 'summer', 'earn', 'little', 'money', 'many', 'years', 'professional', 'athletes', 'were', 'banned', 'competing', 'Olympics', 'International', 'Olympic', 'Committee', 'was', 'vigilant', 'barring', 'professional', 'athletes', 'become', 'detecting', 'performance-enhancing', 'drugs', 'such', 'steroids', 'Jim', 'had', 'natural', 'ability', 'course', 'had', 'great', 'endurance', 'was', 'stripped', 'medals', 'was', 'many', 'many', 'years', 'medals', 'were', 'finally', 'returned', 'family', 'long', 'Jim', 'death', 'prompting', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'bitter', 'complaints', 'cited', 'Jim', 'struggled', 'years', 'see', 'film', 'apparently', 'never', 'was', 'financially', 'successful', 'least', 'lived', 'long', 'enough', 'receive', 'recognition', 'athletic', 'achievemtns.The', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'black', 'white', 'time', 'when', 'more', 'more', 'films', 'were', 'being', 'filmed', 'color', 'presumably', 'use', 'monochrome', 'film', 'was', 'inclusion', 'vintage', 'historic', 'footage', 'engrossing', 'story', 'enhanced', 'Michael', 'Curtiz', 'expertise', 'neared', 'end', 'long', 'tenure', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'very', 'fine', 'musical', 'score', 'veteran', 'Austrian-born', 'composer', 'Max', 'Steiner', 'best', 'known', 'music', 'King', 'Kong', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'Casablanca', '.Hopefully', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'will', 'soon', 'release', 'film', 'DVD', 'already', 'been', 'shown', 'Turner', 'Classic', 'Movies', 'clearly', 'yet', 'top-notch', 'production', 'Burbank', 'studio']",N/A

For instance, if you do not buy into the romanticized version of the depiction of the Indian school in the film, do a little research and you will find statements like &#34;Pratt&#8217;s mission at Carlisle was based on the &#8220;annihilation of the Indian and his salvation as an American citizen,&#8221; the former being a prerequisite of the latter. His [the founder's] often-quoted solution, &#8220;Kill the Indian in him, and save the man,&#8221; provided the philosophical foundation of his program.&#34; Interesting then to see how light-hearted and unworried the 'other Indians' (with exception of the Jim Thorpe character) embraced the school and their starched shirts in the film.
