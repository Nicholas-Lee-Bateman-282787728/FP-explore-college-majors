The show was elegantly staged at the Ballroom of the biggest cruise ship, Queen Mary 2. Carly Simon is, without a doubt, a total performer. Backed by a 15-piece orchestra conducted by Richard Perry, she showed her great stage presence and her cool and confident performances in this show.She gives the timeless gem and my all-time absolute favorite ""Moonlight Serenade"" a contemporary approach without losing its traditional and nostalgic flair as the couples - ladies in their best evening gowns and gentlemen in their black ties, dance cheek-to-cheek to their hearts' delight. She performs evergreen favorites ""I've Got You Under My Skin,"" ""Where Or When,"" ""How Long Has This Been Going On,"" ""All The Things You Are,"" ""Moonglow,"" ""I Only Have Eyes For You,"" ""Alone Together"" and ""The More I See You"" in the most beautiful and sophisticated settings.Also included in the repertoire are songs that leave the truest message of her life such as her original and meaningfully-written compositions ""You're So Vain,"" ""You Belong To Me,"" ""Love of My Life"" and ""Anticipation,"" and not to mention one of her hits but not her original song, ""Nobody Does It Better.""Also shown are behind-the-scene footages with her daughter Sally Taylor performing duets in ""No Secrets"" and ""Devoted To You."" She is also shown on film clips touring the most famous cruise line, meeting and interviewing the Captain of the ship, and taking a tour at the kitchen and sampling its foods - custards, escargot and pico de gallos. There's also a bonus video of a soft and mellow rendition of ""Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow"" showing couples dancing cheek-to-cheek, plus Ms. Simon's photo gallery.This is an enjoyable DVD and one of the best from my collection.

What we have here is a live performance, essentially of the 2005 ""Moonlight Serenade"" album, but with the very happy addition of some old favorites.

Sad, and all the more reason to be grateful for this....Carly is in absolutely prime, perfect voice throughout.
