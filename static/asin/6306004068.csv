LeBlanc ""I love music!""","[18, 20]","Short & Sweet:1) According to the back of the box set, there are no bonus features (on any disc).2) Prophecy II (2/Sequel), is NOT included in this ""Collection"", despite them all being made & distributed through Miramax (so there's no excuse of, ""Don't have the rights"", etc.)Summary:If all they can give Prophecy fans, is somewhat better picture & audio (and even that is debatable, via Standard DVD w/ 'upscaling')... and none of the extras that were contained on the original DVDs (features, commentaries, etc.)... Not to mention, the 2nd Movie, which is after all, the springboard for the 3rd; & anyone unfamiliar w/ the series will have a huge gaping whole in the story-line as a result... Then why waste your money?Keep your DVDs... and if you're really itching for an HD Experience - pop the DVDs in your PS3 or Blu-Ray player for the 'upscaling'... I'm sure it's just as good as what this is, considering they clearly didn't spend any time or effort on improving anything.PS: If you are unfamiliar with the series, and don't own it on DVD already - Just buy the DVDs... they're (much) cheaper, include bonus features (on most), and you can get all 5 Movies (which is the most important thing).  Plus, again, the quality won't be all that different anyway, if you have a DVD Upscaler, or if you play them in your Blu-Ray player._______________________Update:  Read comments & my reply for more info.",1,"Bare Bones Assortment...

486424,AYUFQY3XG4ZBR,6306004068,"Johnny Sideburns ""21st Century Renaissance Man""","[19, 19]","This series of movies details a war in Heaven between opposing factions of angels, those loyal to the Word of God and those loyal to the Archangel Gabriel (played superbly by Christopher Walken), who is jealously unwilling to be placed on a lower shelf than human beings in receiving God's love, being that we humans (or &quot;talking monkeys&quot;, as sneeringly referred to by Gabriel and later Zophael throughout the series) were gifted by The Creator with a soul, which the angels lack.I won't detail each movie in the trilogy in terms of plot specifics (each movie is reviewed separately under its respective title), but I will go so far as to say that this represents a most original Biblical crisis, foretold in an innovative style.  Each movie has its own merits as well as detractions, but the main reason for owning the full set is of course Christopher Walken.  He's obviously enjoying himself throughout the entire series, and as a result he gives an inspired performance as an omnipotent being who is surprisingly weak in areas that one wouldn't normally expect.The key element to remember when watching the series is the lack of Biblical verse set in modern times.  This creates a sense of displacement for the angels on Earth as portrayed in the series; Gabriel's fascination for 20th century technology belies his contempt for those who created it, and his inability to drive a car requires him to intercept humans on their way to their Eternal Reward in order for him to move from place to place.  This is a problem that couldn't've occurred even in the New Testament and one that I feel is dealt with by the series'  producers in a realistic fashion.If you're a fan of Christopher Walken, each of the movies is worth owning, as his development of the Character of Gabriel is well-worth watching.  At the very least I can recommend the first movie in the series to everyone, as it presents a fresh take on a genre of films that lacks many recognized classics, outside of perhaps the &quot;Exorcist&quot; and &quot;Omen&quot; franchises.",5,Christopher Walken as The Angel Of Death...PERFECT casting.,998265600,"08 20, 2001",2001,2053,"['series', 'movies', 'details', 'war', 'Heaven', 'opposing', 'factions', 'angels', 'loyal', 'Word', 'God', 'loyal', 'Archangel', 'Gabriel', 'played', 'superbly', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'who', 'jealously', 'unwilling', 'be', 'placed', 'lower', 'shelf', 'human', 'beings', 'receiving', 'God', 'love', 'being', 'humans', 'quot', 'talking', 'monkeys', 'quot', 'sneeringly', 'referred', 'Gabriel', 'later', 'Zophael', 'series', 'were', 'gifted', 'Creator', 'soul', 'angels', 'lack.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'detail', 'movie', 'trilogy', 'terms', 'plot', 'specifics', 'movie', 'reviewed', 'separately', 'respective', 'title', 'will', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'say', 'most', 'original', 'Biblical', 'crisis', 'foretold', 'innovative', 'style', 'movie', 'own', 'merits', 'as', 'well', 'detractions', 'main', 'reason', 'owning', 'full', 'set', 'course', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'obviously', 'enjoying', 'entire', 'series', 'result', 'inspired', 'performance', 'omnipotent', 'being', 'who', 'surprisingly', 'weak', 'areas', 'one', 'would', ""n't"", 'normally', 'expect.The', 'key', 'element', 'remember', 'when', 'watching', 'series', 'lack', 'Biblical', 'verse', 'set', 'modern', 'times', 'sense', 'displacement', 'angels', 'Earth', 'portrayed', 'series', 'Gabriel', 'fascination', '20th', 'century', 'technology', 'contempt', 'who', 'created', 'inability', 'drive', 'car', 'intercept', 'humans', 'way', 'Eternal', 'Reward', 'order', 'move', 'place', 'place', 'problem', ""'ve"", 'occurred', 'even', 'New', 'Testament', 'one', 'feel', 'dealt', 'series', 'producers', 'realistic', 'fashion.If', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'movies', 'worth', 'owning', 'development', 'Character', 'Gabriel', 'well-worth', 'watching', 'very', 'least', 'can', 'recommend', 'first', 'movie', 'series', 'everyone', 'fresh', 'take', 'genre', 'films', 'many', 'recognized', 'classics', 'perhaps', 'quot', 'Exorcist', 'quot', 'quot', 'Omen', 'quot', 'franchises']",Prophecy Collection: (Prophecy / Prophecy II: Ashtown / Prophecy 3: The Ascent)
