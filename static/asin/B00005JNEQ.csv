630328,ABSX5TGEGRH76,B00005JNEQ,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[9, 10]","I really wish that I had gotten into this show years ago.  I didn't even see an episode until I bought this set, which came out just after the end of the fourth season.  Yes, I try not to do ""blind buys"", but this set came very highly reccomended, and I really enjoy the other material by Zach Braff and Bill Lawrence.The show centers around Dr. John ""J.D."" Dorian (Braff), a medical intern at Sacred Heart Hospital, which is probably one of the craziest hospitals on Earth.  Along with his best friend Chris Turk (Donald Faison), a surgical intern, and Elliot Reid (Sarah Chalke), another medical intern, J.D. tries to make it through the days while having to deal with bizarre patients, nasty superiors, and an insane janitor (Neil Flynn) who can't seem to leave J.D. alone.Other cast-members include Nurse Carla Espinosa (Judy Reyes), who begins a relationship with Turk, Todd Quinlan (Robert Maschio), another surgical intern who becomes a friend of Turk's, and Ted the Lawyer (Sam Lloyd), a pathetic man who is constantly afraid of malpractice suits.  Then there are the doctors.  Dr. Perry Cox (John C. McGinley) is a self-hating cynic who, while appearing to be mean to J.D. and the other interns, really only wants them to succeed, and all of his criticism is (fairly) constructive.  On the other hand is the evil Dr. Bob Kelso (Ken Jenkins).  Kelso is a man who cares more about the money than the patients (as opposed to Cox, who hates the fact that medicine is now a ""business""), and he looks for things that the interns do to criticize.This show has a very wacky kind of humor; utilizing sound effects, cutaways, and metaphors for jokes, almost anything is fair game.  It may take a few minutes to get used to, but this is definitely one of the funniest shows that I've ever seen.  The show makes good use of metaphors; sometimes when a character is speaking metaphorically, we see a cutaway scene showing the metaphor literally (like when J.D. compared the hospital to high school- medical interns are the geeks, surgical interns are the jocks, and nurses are the cheerleaders).  Other times, when a character is speaking literally, we see a metaphorical cut scene.When I first heard about this show, I was unsure as to how the writers could successfully pull off a comedic medical show.  I mean, there is a lot to make fun of, but things can easily be carried too far, especially when dealing with death.  Fortunately, the writers and actors know when to switch from being comedic to being dramatic, and it gives the show a sense of dignity that many other shows do not have.In the extras department, we get some pretty good stuff.  Deleted scenes that are actually funny (I like the one involving two patients who are mentally insane, and believe themselves to be Jesus and Satan), good outtakes, alternate line readings, and audio commentaries.In conclusion, this is a great boxed set.  It is a definite must-own for Scrubs fans, and is worth checking out for someone who's never seen the show.",5,Arrested Development In A Hospital,1116979200,"05 25, 2005",2005,3010,"['really', 'wish', 'had', 'gotten', 'show', 'years', 'ago', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'see', 'episode', 'bought', 'set', 'came', 'out', 'just', 'end', 'fourth', 'season', 'Yes', 'try', 'not', 'do', 'blind', 'buys', 'set', 'came', 'very', 'highly', 'reccomended', 'really', 'enjoy', 'other', 'material', 'Zach', 'Braff', 'Bill', 'Lawrence.The', 'show', 'centers', 'Dr.', 'John', 'J.D', 'Dorian', 'Braff', 'medical', 'intern', 'Sacred', 'Heart', 'Hospital', 'probably', 'one', 'craziest', 'hospitals', 'Earth', 'best', 'friend', 'Chris', 'Turk', 'Donald', 'Faison', 'surgical', 'intern', 'Elliot', 'Reid', 'Sarah', 'Chalke', 'medical', 'intern', 'J.D', 'tries', 'make', 'days', 'having', 'deal', 'bizarre', 'patients', 'nasty', 'superiors', 'insane', 'janitor', 'Neil', 'Flynn', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'leave', 'J.D', 'cast-members', 'include', 'Nurse', 'Carla', 'Espinosa', 'Judy', 'Reyes', 'who', 'relationship', 'Turk', 'Todd', 'Quinlan', 'Robert', 'Maschio', 'surgical', 'intern', 'who', 'friend', 'Turk', 'Ted', 'Lawyer', 'Sam', 'Lloyd', 'pathetic', 'man', 'who', 'constantly', 'afraid', 'malpractice', 'suits', 'Then', 'are', 'doctors', 'Dr.', 'Perry', 'Cox', 'John', 'C.', 'McGinley', 'self-hating', 'cynic', 'who', 'appearing', 'be', 'mean', 'J.D', 'other', 'interns', 'really', 'only', 'succeed', 'criticism', 'fairly', 'constructive', 'other', 'hand', 'evil', 'Dr.', 'Bob', 'Kelso', 'Ken', 'Jenkins', 'Kelso', 'man', 'who', 'more', 'money', 'patients', 'opposed', 'Cox', 'who', 'fact', 'medicine', 'now', 'business', 'things', 'interns', 'do', 'criticize.This', 'show', 'very', 'wacky', 'kind', 'humor', 'utilizing', 'sound', 'effects', 'cutaways', 'metaphors', 'jokes', 'almost', 'anything', 'fair', 'game', 'may', 'take', 'few', 'minutes', 'get', 'used', 'definitely', 'one', 'funniest', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'show', 'good', 'use', 'metaphors', 'sometimes', 'when', 'character', 'speaking', 'metaphorically', 'see', 'cutaway', 'scene', 'showing', 'metaphor', 'literally', 'when', 'J.D', 'compared', 'hospital', 'high', 'school-', 'medical', 'interns', 'are', 'geeks', 'surgical', 'interns', 'are', 'jocks', 'nurses', 'are', 'cheerleaders', 'Other', 'times', 'when', 'character', 'speaking', 'literally', 'see', 'metaphorical', 'cut', 'scene.When', 'first', 'heard', 'show', 'was', 'unsure', 'how', 'writers', 'could', 'successfully', 'pull', 'off', 'comedic', 'medical', 'show', 'mean', 'lot', 'make', 'fun', 'things', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'carried', 'too', 'far', 'especially', 'when', 'dealing', 'death', 'Fortunately', 'writers', 'actors', 'know', 'when', 'switch', 'being', 'comedic', 'being', 'dramatic', 'show', 'sense', 'dignity', 'many', 'other', 'shows', 'do', 'not', 'have.In', 'extras', 'department', 'get', 'pretty', 'good', 'stuff', 'Deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'actually', 'funny', 'like', 'one', 'involving', 'two', 'patients', 'who', 'are', 'mentally', 'insane', 'believe', 'be', 'Jesus', 'Satan', 'good', 'outtakes', 'alternate', 'line', 'readings', 'audio', 'commentaries.In', 'conclusion', 'great', 'boxed', 'set', 'definite', 'must-own', 'Scrubs', 'fans', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'someone', 'who', 'never', 'seen', 'show']",Scrubs - The Complete First Season

Not only is it extremely funny but the diagnoses, the medical red tape, and the personalities of the professions could not be more on the mark. There is the nerdy medical residents, the jock surgical residents, the senior resident who kisses up to the chief of staff, and the nurses who seem to be doing most of the hands on work. I really like that it shows the resident for who he is.. a new graduate with not much experience with patients. I could not stop laughing at the second guessing and the confusion that came with their growing up in this first season. It seems like even the great minds can be bumbling fools.Whoever wrote this show must have had some background at the hospital because its just so ironic how often a scene where I work has come up during one of the episodes- the patients you get attached to, the box of items pulled out of people rectums, the frequent fliers, and of course the heated disagreements between nurses and doctors.This is such a great series that other nurses I work with make it a point to recount lines or scenes.

630331,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B00005JNEQ,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[3, 3]","If you've had a bad day at work and need a little de-stressing, then kick off your shoes and turn on SCRUBS for a heaping medicine cup full of laughs.A bit real world and surreal world, the staff at Sacred Heart Hospital will have you holding your stomach in agony as the belly-laughs rip forth.It's difficult to explain and encapsulate all that this TV series is but we'll give `er a go here. It's about medicine, yes, but it's mainly about the people who administer it and how they view their lives in the medical world. The two main characters are doctors J.D. Dorian (Zach Braff) and Chris Turk (Donald Faison). They've been friends for years and now both work at Sacred Heart. Pecking at their friendship are all the staff and all the business that comes along with hospital life. This includes patients, administrators, a wily janitor, nurses and their own fantasy-filled minds. It is this last item that gives the series its greatest boost ...as well as some over-the-topness that occasionally seems all too frequent. For instance, at one point, J.D. (Braff) discovers that he's losing out on the time he and Turk (Faison) used to spend together because Turk has suddenly gotten involved with a pretty nurse named Carla (Judy Reyes). J.D. invents all kinds of fantasies to get rid of her (including feeding her to sharks, telling Turk she's got some fatal form of a sexually transmitted disease, and many others). All of these fantasies are played out on-screen via J.D.'s twisted mind.But J.D. isn't the only one with delusions of ...whatever. We get inside the minds of almost all the characters, including Dr. Cox's (John C. McGinley) the hospital's whiz-man who oversees all of the interns. It is his insights that are most revealing and funny (he constantly calls J.D. ""Carol"" just to demoralize him). Dr. Cox also enjoys watching soap operas on his breaks and anyone who gets in his way or disturbs this time shall benefit from his wickedly sharp tongue.Then there's the hospital administrator, Dr. Kelso (Ken Jenkins) who strolls the hallways with a phony smile and not a care for the patients. His main goal is to make sure the facility is financially stable, no matter what the cost (?)!Mention of the cast wouldn't be complete without telling you about The Janitor (Neil Flynn). A vital part of the ensemble care within Sacred Heart, The Janitor (who has no-name, by the way) lies his way through life and continually harasses those people above him (mostly J.D. whom he captures and stuffs in hiding places so that he gets in trouble for not being where he's supposed to be). The Janitor's mind works quite a bit differently than all the others on the show, giving us a bizarre insight into the lives of those we rarely see (The Janitor also isn't above fantasizing, including operating on patients, and remembrances of winning championship sports that obviously never occurred.)The overtly silly premises within each characters internal dialogue gives this series almost all of its comedic punch. But it also often drops the comedy down to the lowest common denominator (utilizing bathroom antics, etc.)It's one of those shows that says, ""Hey! Turn off your brain for a while and let it coast on neutral.""",4,Turn Off The Brain And Enjoy,1180051200,"05 25, 2007",2007,3224,"[""'ve"", 'had', 'bad', 'day', 'work', 'need', 'little', 'de-stressing', 'then', 'kick', 'off', 'shoes', 'turn', 'SCRUBS', 'heaping', 'medicine', 'cup', 'full', 'laughs.A', 'bit', 'real', 'world', 'surreal', 'world', 'staff', 'Sacred', 'Heart', 'Hospital', 'will', 'have', 'holding', 'stomach', 'agony', 'belly-laughs', 'rip', 'forth.It', 'difficult', 'explain', 'encapsulate', 'TV', 'series', ""'ll"", 'give', 'er', 'go', 'here', 'medicine', 'yes', 'mainly', 'people', 'who', 'administer', 'how', 'view', 'lives', 'medical', 'world', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'doctors', 'J.D', 'Dorian', 'Zach', 'Braff', 'Chris', 'Turk', 'Donald', 'Faison', ""'ve"", 'been', 'friends', 'years', 'now', 'work', 'Sacred', 'Heart', 'Pecking', 'friendship', 'are', 'staff', 'business', 'along', 'hospital', 'life', 'patients', 'administrators', 'wily', 'janitor', 'nurses', 'own', 'fantasy-filled', 'minds', 'last', 'item', 'series', 'greatest', 'boost', 'as', 'well', 'over-the-topness', 'occasionally', 'too', 'frequent', 'instance', 'one', 'point', 'J.D', 'Braff', 'losing', 'out', 'time', 'Turk', 'Faison', 'used', 'spend', 'together', 'Turk', 'suddenly', 'gotten', 'involved', 'pretty', 'nurse', 'named', 'Carla', 'Judy', 'Reyes', 'J.D', 'invents', 'kinds', 'fantasies', 'get', 'rid', 'including', 'feeding', 'sharks', 'telling', 'Turk', 'got', 'fatal', 'form', 'sexually', 'transmitted', 'disease', 'many', 'others', 'fantasies', 'are', 'played', 'out', 'on-screen', 'J.D', 'twisted', 'mind.But', 'J.D', ""n't"", 'only', 'one', 'delusions', 'get', 'minds', 'almost', 'characters', 'including', 'Dr.', 'Cox', 'John', 'C.', 'McGinley', 'hospital', 'whiz-man', 'who', 'interns', 'insights', 'are', 'most', 'revealing', 'funny', 'constantly', 'J.D', 'Carol', 'just', 'demoralize', 'Dr.', 'Cox', 'also', 'watching', 'soap', 'operas', 'breaks', 'anyone', 'who', 'way', 'disturbs', 'time', 'shall', 'benefit', 'wickedly', 'sharp', 'tongue.Then', 'hospital', 'administrator', 'Dr.', 'Kelso', 'Ken', 'Jenkins', 'who', 'hallways', 'phony', 'smile', 'not', 'care', 'patients', 'main', 'goal', 'make', 'sure', 'facility', 'financially', 'stable', 'matter', 'what', 'cost', 'Mention', 'cast', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'complete', 'telling', 'Janitor', 'Neil', 'Flynn', 'vital', 'part', 'ensemble', 'care', 'Sacred', 'Heart', 'Janitor', 'who', 'no-name', 'way', 'way', 'life', 'continually', 'harasses', 'people', 'mostly', 'J.D', 'whom', 'stuffs', 'hiding', 'places', 'so', 'trouble', 'not', 'being', 'where', 'supposed', 'be', 'Janitor', 'mind', 'quite', 'bit', 'differently', 'others', 'show', 'giving', 'bizarre', 'insight', 'lives', 'rarely', 'see', 'Janitor', 'also', ""n't"", 'fantasizing', 'including', 'operating', 'patients', 'remembrances', 'winning', 'championship', 'sports', 'obviously', 'never', 'occurred', 'overtly', 'silly', 'premises', 'characters', 'internal', 'dialogue', 'series', 'almost', 'comedic', 'punch', 'also', 'often', 'comedy', 'down', 'lowest', 'common', 'denominator', 'utilizing', 'bathroom', 'antics', 'etc', 'one', 'shows', 'Hey', 'Turn', 'off', 'brain', 'while', 'let', 'coast', 'neutral']",Scrubs - The Complete First Season

I found the wonderful mix of comedy and drama unforgettable, and was locked on every week, more and more excited for each new episode. I lost track of when Scrubs came on after this season, but when I found out Season 1 was coming out on DVD I was right there ready to buy. Every episode was just as good, if not better, than I remembered them to be, and having them uncut was a much desired plus.As you probably know, Scrubs can go from tear-jerking to hilarious in mere seconds, I like this quality in a show. If a show focuses only on comedy, it gets stale over time, if it focuses only on drama all the time, it gets boring. In Scrubs' case, they have actors that are hilarious when they want to be and as serious as can be when they need to be. There is no better way to see this skill than in the episode entitled My Old Lady. Side-splitting one minute, and 'pretend you got something in your eye so they won't know you're about to cry' the next minute. Each situation JD and his friends are put in seems like it could happen to anyone who works in a hospital. A bully, a bossy mentor, and of course, friends.

I learned a lot about the show that I'd never known before. The extra stuff on here gave me an even greater appreciation for the actors, writers, producers, etc. They're an incredibly talented group of people.Also worth noting is how great Neil Flynn is in the extra stuff on here. I've always liked his Janitor character on the show a lot, but seeing him in the extras is especially great. I never knew before how much of his character's material was actually ad-libs from Flynn. The man is hilarious.If you're a fan of Scrubs, or just a fan of great television, then do yourself a favor and get this great dvd compilation.You'll be glad you did.",5,One of the best television shows ever,1125187200,"08 28, 2005",2005,1156,"['dvd', 'compilation', 'fantastic', 'Scrubs', 'doubt', 'one', 'best', 'television', 'ever', 'hilarious', 'also', 'very', 'dramatic', 'times', 'Few', 'shows', 'history', 'television', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'mix', 'comedy', 'drama', 'together', 'as', 'well', 'Scrubs', 'has.And', 'what', 'truly', 'amazing', 'Scrubs', 'did', 'so', 'well', 'so', 'early', 'run', 'first', 'season', 'fantastic', 'are', 'LOT', 'classic', 'episodes', 'here', 'What', 'especially', 'great', 'dvd', 'compilation', 'extra', 'stuff', 'included', 'learned', 'lot', 'show', ""'d"", 'never', 'known', 'before', 'extra', 'stuff', 'here', 'gave', 'even', 'greater', 'appreciation', 'actors', 'writers', 'producers', 'etc', ""'re"", 'incredibly', 'talented', 'group', 'people.Also', 'worth', 'noting', 'how', 'great', 'Neil', 'Flynn', 'extra', 'stuff', 'here', ""'ve"", 'always', 'liked', 'Janitor', 'character', 'show', 'lot', 'seeing', 'extras', 'especially', 'great', 'never', 'knew', 'how', 'much', 'character', 'material', 'was', 'actually', 'ad-libs', 'Flynn', 'man', 'hilarious.If', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Scrubs', 'just', 'fan', 'great', 'television', 'then', 'do', 'favor', 'get', 'great', 'dvd', 'compilation.You', ""'ll"", 'be', 'glad', 'did']",Scrubs - The Complete First Season

630336,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B00005JNEQ,calvinnme,"[10, 11]","""Scrubs"" and ""Homicide: Life on the Streets"" have a lot in common - they are/were high quality shows of their genre that were never given the respect or attention they deserved and were both moved around and ultimately stuck in time slots that would cause them to remain undiscovered by the average viewer. I myself did not discover this series until it showed up in syndication several months ago. ""Scrubs"" came into existence after Bill Lawrence visited some old college friends who were now doctors. Listening to stories about the crazy things that went on during their internships, Lawrence was inspired to create a comedy about young interns learning the ropes of their profession in a hospital environment. Since Lawrence used to work on ""Spin City"", most of that show's cast members have guested on Scrubs over the years.J.D. - John Dorian - is an insecure, geeky, constantly self-analyzing medical intern and the central character of the show. Everything is narrated by and seen through him. This includes a series of fantasy scenes that occur in almost every episode that amount to the musings and daydreams of J.D.'s overactive imagination.Dr. Cox is the sometime mentor and sometime tormentor of J.D. Cox is a brilliant doctor and really likes hearing it from anyone who'll tell him. Dr. Cox routinely rants at and/or belittles J.D., though his apparently rough treatment of J.D. is intended as conditioning for the rigors and horrors of hospital life, as well as an outlet for Cox's frustration in his personal life. Much credit has to go to the writers, of course, who consistently give John McGinley (Cox) the best rants you'll find outside of Dennis Miller Live, but they wouldn't be half as funny if not delivered with the perfect intonation and scathing sarcasm by a man who seems like the word ""snark"" was literally invented to describe him. These days, the phrase ""he was born to play that part"" gets tossed around a lot, so much so that it's lost a lot of its meaning, but believe me when I say, truthfully, that John McGinley was born to play Dr. Perry Cox.Dr. Cox does occasionally offer up words of wisdom to J.D., though. For example, Cox tells J.D. that the ICU is full of old people that would be more than glad to leave this planet, but will likely go on living for years and years. However, he points out, J.D.'s current ICU patient is just young enough to die, since it is Dr. Cox's observation that ""God hates doctors"".Remarkably, the relationship between Elliot, an attractive and well-off fellow intern, and J.D. takes off and then crashes all in one mid-season episode during the first year, but manages to not turn into the ""Sam & Diane Show"" like Cheers did where eventually the see-sawing relationship took over the show and got so old that there was nothing else to do with it. Also, Carla and Turk are almost instantaneously a couple, but that plays out well too. Their relationship becomes a badly needed bulwark of stability in what is a parade of dysfunctional relationships, even the dysfunctional ones that seem to work. For example, Dr. Cox divorces his wife, and from that point forward their relationship seems to work as well as any relationship involving those two. Dr. Kelso, the evil chief of medicine, has been married for years, but he and his wife live completely separate lives. Instead, the love of Dr. Kelso's life is his dog Baxter.The janitor, as J.D.'s foil throughout the series, is a great touch of originality - who would think of making a janitor a regular on a comedy that revolves around a hospital? The janitor has an air of mystery about him though. You get the feeling he is a Renaissance man who has decided to retire from the world and hide behind his mop. Especially since he speaks Spanish, Korean and Italian as well as English, being also able to pull off, convincingly, at least 3 different accents and types of English speech.Through all this there is the friendship of Turk and J.D. that has lasted since college. They are roommates while they are completing their internships and residencies, and share each other's goofy sense of humor. Turk and J.D. own a stuffed Golden Retriever named Rowdy which they treat like a live dog, giving him baths, and speaking to him as if he can answer back. However, Turk is in a surgical residency, while J.D. is a medical resident. This is often shown as a humorous rivalry in which the two groups are made to look like rival gangs in West Side Story or like rival cliques in high school in which the surgery interns are the cool kids and the medical interns are the geeks.My personal vote for best episode of the first season is ""My Old Lady"" (MOL). There were other close contenders, but this one really stands out. MOL has that spot-on balance of comedy and drama that I love about the show -- early on, J.D.'s voiceover informs us that one out of every three patients admitted to the hospital will die there, then we follow he, Elliot, and Turk as each strives not to be the one to lose theirs. The format allows for equal focus on all three, gives us a great understanding of their individual issues, and ultimately shows just how well the actors were grasping their characters so early on. Very funny in places, intensely emotional in others, and making excellent use of background music, MOL illustrates the Scrubs formula perfectly.",5,"An undiscovered jewel, Scrubs is the Rodney

The mix of outrageous cutaways, great acting, and heartwarming or sad storylines lift this above so many other sitcoms.The casting of the main characters is excellent.  Zach Braff may have been unproven at the time, but he has proven to be a great choice, and I doubt any Scrubs fans were surprised by his recent film success in Garden State.  Donald Faison and Sarah Chalke both give their characters great texture, and Neil Flynn has a number of scene-stealing moments playing the Janitor.  However, the person who stands out most in this first season is the horribly underrated John McGinley, who plays Dr. Cox with a manic energy that has somehow gone unnoticed for 5 years.  While there are times you might despise him, he's also easy to sympathize with, and his character is responsible for many of the show's great moments.There are several standout episodes, with very few weak ones.  The episodes, ""My Mentor"" and ""My Super Ego"" stand out, since they inject some seriousness into the usual comedy.

The cast talk about their roles with input from Lawrence.There is an audio commentary on ""My First Day"" by Bill Lawrence. Like Arrested Development, Scrubs is a sitcom that only uses one camera which made the network nervous. He touches upon the evolution of the characters and offers some good observations.Lawrence returns on the commentary for ""My Old Lady"" with Zach Braff along for the ride. They joke around in this light and engaging track.Lawrence and actor Neil Flynn provide commentary on ""My Fifteen Minutes."" Flynn dispels the myth that he adlibs all of his lines and they talk about the colourful extras and reoccurring supporting cast that appear in this episode.The second DVD features a music video for the show's jaunty theme song, ""Superman"" by Lazlo Bane in its entirety with behind-the-scenes clips of the show mixed with footage of the band performing.""The Doctor is In"" is a brief featurette with Braff talking about he got on the show despite an awful audition. Braff talks about meeting the rest of the cast and his impressions of them in this entertaining extra.""Alternate Lines: A Second Opinion"" is a nine minute reel of different takes from various scenes by Flynn, Braff and the very funny John C. McGinley.Also included is an audio commentary on ""My Blind Date"" by Lawrence and Braff once again. They comment on the performances of the supporting cast and talk about the network's insistence that J.D.'s girlfriend in the episode had to be beautiful.The third disc features ""Not Just Another Medical Show,"" a featurette that examines how Lawrence wanted to avoid shooting in a studio in favour of on location in a converted, run-down hospital. The show's technical advisors talk about how they try to keep the show's medical jargon and situations authentic.""Favorite Moments"" sees the cast and crew recounting their cherished bits from the show. They talk about how it also deals with real issues in between comedic set pieces and the guest stars that graced the first season.There is also a four minute ""Outtakes Reel,"" a montage of blown lines and goofy takes that give a little insight into how much fun the cast and crew must have working on the show.Also included is ten minutes worth of deleted scenes. Sadly, they aren't put in any context so it's hard to figure out what episode they're from. However, there are some really funny bits and it's a shame that they were cut.There is an audio commentary on ""My Sacrificial Clam"" by Lawrence and actors Sam Lloyd and Robert Maschio. Not surprisingly, the actors talk about their characters and laugh along with the episode. Maschio provides a lot of the humour on this amusing track.Finally, there is a commentary for ""My Hero"" by Lawrence and John C. McGinley. This episode shows Dr. Cox's vulnerable side and fleshes out his character. Contrary to his on-screen persona, McGinley is pretty low-key on this solid track.",4,Calling Dr. Bambi...,1116374400,"05 18, 2005",2005,4325,"['Scrubs', 'medical', 'comedy', 'group', 'new', 'interns', 'who', 'are', 'adjusting', 'demands', 'working', 'front', 'lines', 'busy', 'hospital', 'J.D', 'Braff', 'idealistic', 'one', 'who', 'also', 'show', 'Turk', 'Faison', 'cocky', 'surgical', 'intern', 'Elliot', 'Chalke', 'goofy', 'ditz', 'whom', 'J.D', 'attracted', 'Turk', 'drawn', 'Carla', 'Reyes', 'sarcastic', 'nurse', 'day-to-day', 'routine', 'J.D', 'deal', 'tough', 'demanding', 'Dr.', 'Cox', 'McGinley', 'gleefully', 'pompous', 'Dr.', 'Kelso', 'Jenkins', 'mean', 'janitor', 'Flynn', 'who', 'delights', 'tormenting', 'young', 'intern.The', 'show', 'engaging', 'zany', 'sense', 'humour', 'reminiscent', 'early', 'Zucker', 'Abrams', 'Zucker', 'movies', 'Airplane', 'Top', 'Secret', 'complete', 'snappy', 'dialogue', 'visualizing', 'what', 'J.D', 'imagines', 'given', 'situation', 'example', 'moment', 'complete', 'exasperation', 'frustration', 'J.D', 'head', 'quite', 'literally', 'illustrate', 'competitive', 'nature', 'Elliot', 'see', 'two', 'race', 'hallway', 'something', 'track', 'field', 'meet', 'complete', 'Cheap', 'Trick', 'blasting', 'away', 'soundtrack.The', 'first', 'starts', 'Newbies', 'featurette', 'where', 'show', 'creator', 'Bill', 'Lawrence', 'talks', 'briefly', 'how', 'created', 'Scrubs', 'incorporated', 'real', 'stories', 'friends', 'who', 'were', 'doctors', 'writers', 'talk', 'how', 'season', 'episode', 'are', 'constructed', 'writers', 'work', 'closely', 'actors', 'play', 'strengths', 'cast', 'talk', 'roles', 'input', 'Lawrence.There', 'audio', 'commentary', 'First', 'Day', 'Bill', 'Lawrence', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'Scrubs', 'sitcom', 'only', 'one', 'camera', 'made', 'network', 'nervous', 'evolution', 'characters', 'good', 'observations.Lawrence', 'returns', 'commentary', 'Old', 'Lady', 'Zach', 'Braff', 'ride', 'joke', 'around', 'light', 'engaging', 'track.Lawrence', 'actor', 'Neil', 'Flynn', 'provide', 'commentary', 'Fifteen', 'Minutes', 'Flynn', 'myth', 'lines', 'talk', 'colourful', 'extras', 'reoccurring', 'supporting', 'cast', 'appear', 'episode.The', 'second', 'DVD', 'music', 'video', 'show', 'jaunty', 'theme', 'song', 'Superman', 'Lazlo', 'Bane', 'entirety', 'behind-the-scenes', 'clips', 'show', 'mixed', 'footage', 'band', 'performing', 'Doctor', 'brief', 'featurette', 'Braff', 'talking', 'got', 'show', 'awful', 'audition', 'Braff', 'talks', 'meeting', 'rest', 'cast', 'impressions', 'entertaining', 'extra', 'Alternate', 'Lines', 'Second', 'Opinion', 'nine', 'minute', 'reel', 'different', 'various', 'scenes', 'Flynn', 'Braff', 'very', 'funny', 'John', 'C.', 'McGinley.Also', 'included', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Blind', 'Date', 'Lawrence', 'Braff', 'once', 'again', 'comment', 'performances', 'supporting', 'cast', 'talk', 'network', 'insistence', 'J.D', 'girlfriend', 'episode', 'had', 'be', 'beautiful.The', 'third', 'disc', 'features', 'Not', 'Just', 'Medical', 'Show', 'featurette', 'how', 'Lawrence', 'wanted', 'avoid', 'shooting', 'studio', 'favour', 'location', 'converted', 'run-down', 'hospital', 'show', 'technical', 'advisors', 'talk', 'how', 'try', 'keep', 'show', 'medical', 'jargon', 'situations', 'authentic', 'Favorite', 'Moments', 'cast', 'crew', 'recounting', 'cherished', 'bits', 'show', 'talk', 'how', 'also', 'real', 'issues', 'comedic', 'set', 'pieces', 'guest', 'graced', 'first', 'season.There', 'also', 'four', 'minute', 'Outtakes', 'Reel', 'montage', 'blown', 'lines', 'goofy', 'give', 'little', 'insight', 'how', 'much', 'fun', 'cast', 'crew', 'must', 'have', 'working', 'show.Also', 'included', 'ten', 'minutes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Sadly', 'are', ""n't"", 'put', 'context', 'hard', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'episode', ""'re"", 'However', 'are', 'really', 'funny', 'bits', 'shame', 'were', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Sacrificial', 'Clam', 'Lawrence', 'actors', 'Sam', 'Lloyd', 'Robert', 'Maschio', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'actors', 'talk', 'characters', 'laugh', 'episode', 'Maschio', 'lot', 'humour', 'amusing', 'track.Finally', 'commentary', 'Hero', 'Lawrence', 'John', 'C.', 'McGinley', 'episode', 'Dr.', 'Cox', 'vulnerable', 'side', 'out', 'character', 'Contrary', 'on-screen', 'persona', 'McGinley', 'pretty', 'low-key', 'solid', 'track']",Scrubs - The Complete First Season

She likes a regular routine.For a great number of years I had to watch I LOVE LUCY episodes over and over and over, if I wanted to spend time with her in front of the TV. One day I was laughing at an episode of the `70's show, and she sat down and watched it and finally realized that the ""Hi~Jinx"" on the show were largely a recreation of our past, and she was hooked.So... We watched (and still do) the episodes over and over and over.Then one day, I saw an episode of Malcolm in the Middle, and I was hooked, and eventually my sweetheart saw that that show was our family (give or take) and we watched the show over and over, I think she wanted to cry when the series concluded.The one thing that really stood out for us was the fact that the writing was so good, that the producers had faith that the audience would get the jokes without a laugh track. Ever since then, we have been put off by any show with a laugh track.Subsequently, I got hooked on ""Dead Like Me"" after it also was cancelled, but my sweetheart, did not like that show at all, as it was too dark. Finally, last year (It's remarkable how much new TV you can miss by watching old shows in syndication) I sat through my first complete episode of Scrubs, and then only after glowing reviews from Orson Scott Card, on his website. With some work, and stressing the no laugh track angle, I got my wife to watch a couple shows. Soon she also was hooked. So now, even though the show is in its final season, there are plenty of seasons on DVD that we have yet to see.So here we have started with season one, and it is very, very funny.

630355,A1VH43DIOLL4DW,B00005JNEQ,Humberto,"[6, 7]","A while back, I'd introduced my girlfriend to Scrubs.  She didn't like it much.  She thought it was okay, but wasn't overwhelmed by its comedy.  As I made her watch a few more episodes, she started to like it more and more.  Then the season one DVDs arrived.  She now loves the show.  What she didn't realize at first is that Scrubs is more than just a comedy.  The characters all play so well off each other.  There's incredibly touching moments in the show, where the characters are forced to grow (like JD's patient telling him she's ready to die, or Elliott choosing her career over Scott Foley).  I don't know a single show that has ever blended comedy in with so many touching moments half as well as Scrubs has, while casting actors who are all brilliant for their parts (including Clueless Guy, and Clueless Guy's friend...  Watch the extras for the reference).  Season one had to be the best season Scrubs has done, and my girlfriend is now as devoted a fan as I am after watching the full season with me.Here's the deal, and the reality of it all.  As great a show as Scrubs is, it will never be a hit.  Ever!  Why, you ask?  Because it's different.  Most people in this world don't want a different show, they want the same thing.  They want Friends, Friends spinoffs, Cheers, Cheers spinoffs, CSI, CSI spinoffs, Survivor, and all the reality shows it's delivered, and television shows that are overhyped.  When they go to the movies, they want sequels and old television show remakes.  Don't get me wrong, I've seen and loved Batman Begins, and I'll be going to see Star Wars again soon.  Many people don't like unexpected or original.  But fans of quality television look at shows like Seinfeld and movies like Napoleon Dynamite, and think that Scrubs or Arrested Development might follow in the footsteps of their success - as quality shows or movies that nobody watches at first, but soon catch fire with a much bigger following.  But they won't.  The reason is those shows are completely quotable.  Think about how many times over the years you've heard people refer to things as Seinfeldian, or how many people still quote Seinfeld, referring to someone as a close-talker, or having man-hands, yadda yadda yadda, or imitating Elaine's dance.  Now try to think of quotable lines from Srubs.  All I can come up with is if someone tells me to kiss their rear, to ask if they'll hold me after, or calling my coworker Newbie.  Scrubs was never overhyped, isn't familiar territory, and ultimately isn't completely quotable.  But it's quality television with no apologies.If you're already a fan of the series, you need to re-live the first season with this DVD collection.  If you're not, try not to let how different it is scare you away.  And if you already like your comedy to NOT involve someone saying, ""How YOU doin',"" this show may just be for you.",5,TV at its finest,1121040000,"07 11, 2005",2005,2866,"['while', 'back', ""'d"", 'introduced', 'girlfriend', 'Scrubs', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'much', 'thought', 'was', 'okay', 'was', ""n't"", 'overwhelmed', 'comedy', 'made', 'watch', 'few', 'more', 'episodes', 'started', 'like', 'more', 'more', 'Then', 'season', 'one', 'DVDs', 'arrived', 'now', 'show', 'What', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'first', 'Scrubs', 'more', 'just', 'comedy', 'characters', 'play', 'so', 'well', 'other', 'incredibly', 'touching', 'moments', 'show', 'where', 'characters', 'are', 'forced', 'grow', 'JD', 'patient', 'telling', 'ready', 'die', 'Elliott', 'choosing', 'career', 'Scott', 'Foley', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'single', 'show', 'ever', 'blended', 'comedy', 'so', 'many', 'touching', 'moments', 'half', 'as', 'well', 'Scrubs', 'casting', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'brilliant', 'parts', 'including', 'Clueless', 'Guy', 'Clueless', 'Guy', 'friend', 'Watch', 'extras', 'reference', 'Season', 'one', 'had', 'be', 'best', 'season', 'Scrubs', 'done', 'girlfriend', 'now', 'as', 'devoted', 'fan', 'am', 'watching', 'full', 'season', 'me.Here', 'deal', 'reality', 'great', 'show', 'Scrubs', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'hit', 'Ever', 'Why', 'ask', 'different', 'Most', 'people', 'world', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'different', 'show', 'want', 'same', 'thing', 'want', 'Friends', 'Friends', 'spinoffs', 'Cheers', 'Cheers', 'spinoffs', 'CSI', 'CSI', 'spinoffs', 'Survivor', 'reality', 'delivered', 'television', 'shows', 'are', 'overhyped', 'When', 'go', 'movies', 'want', 'sequels', 'old', 'television', 'show', 'remakes', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'loved', 'Batman', 'Begins', ""'ll"", 'be', 'going', 'see', 'Star', 'Wars', 'again', 'soon', 'Many', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'unexpected', 'original', 'fans', 'quality', 'television', 'look', 'shows', 'Seinfeld', 'movies', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'think', 'Scrubs', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'might', 'follow', 'footsteps', 'success', 'quality', 'shows', 'movies', 'nobody', 'watches', 'first', 'soon', 'catch', 'fire', 'much', 'bigger', 'following', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reason', 'shows', 'are', 'completely', 'quotable', 'Think', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'years', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'people', 'refer', 'things', 'Seinfeldian', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'still', 'quote', 'Seinfeld', 'referring', 'someone', 'close-talker', 'having', 'man-hands', 'yadda', 'yadda', 'yadda', 'imitating', 'Elaine', 'dance', 'Now', 'try', 'think', 'quotable', 'lines', 'Srubs', 'can', 'come', 'up', 'someone', 'kiss', 'rear', 'ask', ""'ll"", 'hold', 'calling', 'coworker', 'Newbie', 'Scrubs', 'was', 'never', 'overhyped', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'territory', 'ultimately', ""n't"", 'completely', 'quotable', 'quality', 'television', 'apologies.If', ""'re"", 'already', 'fan', 'series', 'need', 're-live', 'first', 'season', 'DVD', 'collection', ""'re"", 'not', 'try', 'not', 'let', 'how', 'different', 'scare', 'away', 'already', 'comedy', 'NOT', 'involve', 'someone', 'saying', 'How', 'YOU', 'doin', 'show', 'may', 'just', 'be']",Scrubs - The Complete First Season

Scrubs however is sensational value for money and leads the way with high quality features and lots of them setting the bench mark at where the others TV shows need to aim. A lot of television show pilot episodes and first seasons also are no where near the quality of later seasons but again not so with Scrubs.  Scrubs hit the ground running with their masterpiece pilot that not only set the scene for the series but in my opinion is up there with the funniest episodes ever.  I don't know any other TV show that you can say that about.As well as all 24 original first season episodes we also get the show's theme song, Superman Music Video which I had never seen before.  There's also deleted scenes, outtakes and cast interviews.  The cast interviews are brilliant you really get to see what the actors are like outside of their characters.  Complementing this feature is the Favourite Moments sections where the stars and key crew members don't just relive parts of episodes which are their favourites but tell you why they enjoy them so much.  The features are also very informative, you'll know so much more about the show after watching them.  For example the lines after ""Did you Stick a Penny in There"" were all adlib by the janitor gaining him a regular spot and allowed the tension between the janitor and JD to be a part of every episode.  Newbies, where we learn about the actors before Scrubs is also entertaining and interesting.Scrubs is one of the few shows where it doesn't matter that you've seen the episode before you just keep watching them over and over again with the fun part being just waiting for the lines.  The advantage scrubs have over other high quality comedy shows such as Seinfeld who have the line factor is that Scrubs also has the surreal sight gags which means you're eagerly awaiting not just funny lines but the funny sight gags as well.Scrubs the Complete First Season is exceptional value for money. 24 episodes, plus a few on twice with voiceovers versions as well as heaps of high quality bonus features mean you just have to own this sensational show on DVD!",5,"Scrubs has Made it All on Their Own, I Know, Yes I Know This is a Super D, DVD, DVD!

630364,ATAO781X1B6SY,B00005JNEQ,John J. Martinez,"[10, 12]","Reviewer Michael Mueller is under the impression that this comedy should be something more than it could be - well, my friend, I'd like you to see it for what is.&lt;&lt;echoing>> It's a COMEDY! Based on FICTICIOUS charecters! Not real life!I, for one, am glad the writers made it the way it is - hip, full of pop references and sometimes improvisations, and it's about a hospital that I would never go to. The medical system has been ripped apart and skewered before by a little Paddy Chayefsky film called ""Hospital"" in the early 1970s with George C. Scott. To hold this little sitcom up against such other shows as ""M*A*S*H"" etc. is just silly pretense.Also, to say that this show is a ""lame sitcom"" and full of ""racial and gender stereotypes"" is ludicrous. Everyone here is made fun of - black, white, women, men, little and tall people, clowns, overeaters, drug addicts, cancer patients, the elderly and the children, and almost everyone else you can think of.So WHAT if there is no actual medicine in the show being performed most of the time - it's about the personalities of these same performers, letting us know that maybe our these people might just be human and have failing points, too. After the disaster of ""Doogie Howser,"" who could ever watch shows like that without wondering about how screwed up they were?Granted, I will admit that Zack Braff and Co. can get a little too dopey for me to believe they actually know the proceedures they quote, but I understand that that is the point of it. They are the clowns, making us laugh for half an hour. What does REAL medicine have to do with that?Someone has definately taken an overdose of serious pills.On a personal note, I only started watching the show just a few months back in early 2007 - not the new ones, but the reruns on Comedy Channel. However, I am glad - GLAD - to have discovered this little treat, and I am buying all of the seasons on DVD. Honestly, watching Hawkeye and ""the Beej"" grow crowsfeet, hunched backs and greying hair over what is only supposed to be in real-time two years while watching him operate and quote outdated proceedures is now kinda sad in retrospect.I think ""Scrubs"" has succeded in making me laugh, and the writers were smart enough to understand that they are actually keeping it fresh by using the same hateful, misogynistic, latently homosexual, angry, manic dialogue that many of us hear in REAL LIFE at their jobs at one form or another, and (pun alert) it is just what the doctor ordered.Now for me, I don't know which is worse: that someone could go out of their way to pan this show and it's shortcomings online, or someone like me defending their First Amendment rights to be as witty and as funny as some of the oldest comedies have done in the past, to be morons who reference Huggy Bear and the Love Connection, so that someone like me can understand it because it's not too obscure!It is FAR AND AWAY funnier than the pathetic and predictible ""Seinfeld"" and can kick ""Raymond's"" crying simpish butt anyday. I hope that whoever DID green-light this show should be HAPPY they did the right thing and saw the potential for the one saving grace of ""sitcoms"" everywhere.I am amazed that someone can also level charges of racism. RACISM? The names ""Chocolate Bear"" ""Mocha Bear"" are funny in that it's the most obvious way the latent homosexuality can hover between JD and Turk like a rainbow-flavored blanket without looking like a white-hooded robe!I also think that by using terms of sarcasm such as ""...such sophistication and realism..."" about poo jokes online only goes to show the limited abilities of the person questioning the humor in a poo joke.These are the same kinds of people who hate Howard Stern, and would have signed a petition 40 years ago to have Lenny Bruce tossed out of New York.I will grant Michael one observational point, however - there is no character development.To be honest, why should there be?John Dorian (not ""Dorien"") IS a ""whiney twit"" - he is also clueless, a total nerd, a scatterbrained dreamer and a lousy dancer and kisser, but in the end he is always willing to give his all for a patient and for a friend. What's wrong with that? For any of them to change their personalities would completely change the makeup of the show. They have a proven track record (and the Emmys to prove it), so why mess with emotional retardation that we can all enjoy?I am also going to have to admit one other point to Michael: the main theme of the show being ""GenX losers having to take up some slack and join the workforce (in this case as Doctors)"". Yup, I have to admit his point: many twenty-somethings (and even to a lesser extent early thirty-somethings) are pretty much lost to dealing with real responsibility. But, at least the good staff at Sacred Heart have their hearts in the right place.Lastly, I have to ask: have you ever seen a little film called ""Platoon?"" John C. McGinley was in that, and in that HE played the JD suck-up role to the mentor/father figure of the bunch. It's now 20 years later, and now it's time for him to be the sadist. He was a smart actor by taking on the role of the bitter burned-out mentor because he knew he could be in control. His talents are not wasted.As with Michael, I've seen worse shows over the years as well: the miserable Seinfeld, Raymond, King of Queens, World According to Jim, etc. they are ALL not funny. But me? I sit back almost every night and get a laugh after a hard day by watching people who are supposed to be professionals rip each other to shreds, just like they do at almost any other place, but it's exaggerated, pulled tight, and I laugh - a lot.The show is chock full of people who are negative, passionate, schizophrenic, blindingly optimistic, manic depressive, jealous and every other large word that I can think of offhand.It's funny. I laugh. Mission accomplished. No fighter planes on the deck needed here.I'm hopeful that I will NEVER get tired of this kind of humor. To do so would to prove to me that I'm finally ready to tackle ""Seinfeld.""",4,"""M.A.S.H. it isn't?"" he says.

630365,A30NEB69DC1RSP,B00005JNEQ,"Joseph Devon ""Author of Probability Angels""","[0, 0]","I'm always amazed that more people I know don't watch this show.  It's irreverent and slap sticky while at the same time thoughtful and touching. Its roots are obvious as it takes a page from every screwball comedy since the days of Chaplin, constantly (and borderline zealously) cutting away mid-scene to show snippets and asides that perfectly complete whatever joke is just about to be spoken.  The effect is extremely cartoonish and I'm pretty sure the writers were Simpson's junkies.But the comedy mixes well with hospital drama to create a final product that's unlike any medical show out there.  Season one starts with J.D. (Zach Braff) on his first day as a hospital intern.  Only instead of the heavy handed drama and over the top emoting that you get with most hospital shows, this one focuses on making you laugh while managing to sneak in real emotion and wonderfully original characters, making it come across as a more realistic show over-all despite it's zany comedy backbone.

630366,AVR3F6VQYIMZW,B00005JNEQ,Joseph Tidline,"[3, 4]","Scrubs is one of those unique comedies that requires you to decide what is funny and what is not because there is no laugh track. So I tend to find myself laughing all the time. Scrubs has one of the best casts I have seen in awhile. All of the actors seem like they have known each other for years. And John C. McGinley's performance as Dr. Cox is one of the best characters in television history. The character is so mean, evil and sarcastic yet you can't help but love him. McGinley deserves an Emmy nomination, at the least, for this great role.Scrubs is a very well written show that just has not gotten the respect that it deserves. It is constantly shuffled around on NBC's schedule and the biggest injustice of all is that NBC left the show of it's fall schedule. One of the funniest shows on television has now been turned into a midseason replacement and that is just a tragedy. That is why I am glad to see that Scrubs has now been released on DVD. Now I can watch this show whenever I choose and it can get the proper attention and respect it deserves. Maybe if this series sells well on DVD NBC will realize what a gem they have and return it to the schedule. Also I am glad that they are not hesistating to release future episodes in a timely fashion. I look forward to getting season 2 when it is released.If you are looking for a good laugh and love to repeat lines from television shows over and over then this is the show for you. If given a chance you will not regret buying this set. I dare you not to laugh at this show.",5,One of the funniest shows on television that no one is watching,1126396800,"09 11, 2005",2005,1541,"['Scrubs', 'one', 'unique', 'comedies', 'decide', 'what', 'funny', 'what', 'not', 'laugh', 'track', 'tend', 'find', 'laughing', 'time', 'Scrubs', 'one', 'best', 'casts', 'have', 'seen', 'awhile', 'actors', 'seem', 'have', 'known', 'other', 'years', 'John', 'C.', 'McGinley', 'performance', 'Dr.', 'Cox', 'one', 'best', 'characters', 'television', 'history', 'character', 'so', 'mean', 'evil', 'sarcastic', 'yet', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'love', 'McGinley', 'Emmy', 'nomination', 'least', 'great', 'role.Scrubs', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'show', 'just', 'not', 'gotten', 'respect', 'constantly', 'shuffled', 'around', 'NBC', 'schedule', 'biggest', 'injustice', 'NBC', 'left', 'show', 'fall', 'schedule', 'One', 'funniest', 'shows', 'television', 'now', 'been', 'turned', 'midseason', 'replacement', 'just', 'tragedy', 'why', 'am', 'glad', 'see', 'Scrubs', 'now', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'Now', 'can', 'watch', 'show', 'whenever', 'choose', 'can', 'get', 'proper', 'attention', 'respect', 'Maybe', 'series', 'well', 'DVD', 'NBC', 'will', 'realize', 'what', 'gem', 'have', 'return', 'schedule', 'Also', 'am', 'glad', 'are', 'not', 'hesistating', 'release', 'future', 'episodes', 'timely', 'fashion', 'look', 'forward', 'getting', 'season', '2', 'when', 'released.If', 'are', 'looking', 'good', 'laugh', 'love', 'repeat', 'lines', 'television', 'shows', 'then', 'show', 'given', 'chance', 'will', 'not', 'regret', 'buying', 'set', 'dare', 'not', 'laugh', 'show']",Scrubs - The Complete First Season
630367,A2XAGLR8VDOU6T,B00005JNEQ,"Joshua Spaulding ""Television God""","[2, 3]","Scrubs is one of those shows that doesn't get the ratings that it truly deserves, and because of that, often doesn't get the attention when it comes to recognition and award shows.That did change a little this year when the show received some nominations, and a look back at the first season shows where this smart and very funny show got its roots and how everything got started.The show follows the life of a trio of interns as they enter their first jobs at Sacred Heart hospital. Zach Braff is the series' main star, as he plays John J.D. Dorian, who provides the voice overs for much the show and additionally, the show is written mainly from his perspective, which is obvious by the titles of every episode: ""My Hero,"" ""My Last Day,"" etc. Braff is a great actor and this character really fits him well. In the first season, as a doctor probably is at that point in his life, J.D. is pretty nervous and unsure of himself. Braff projects that innocence, and as the season moves along, the growing confidence, very well.Donald Faison plays J.D.'s best friend Chris Turk, a surgical intern. The two roomates have been friends for years and their relationship serves as a great catalyst for both humerous moments and serious issues. Turk begins his relationship with nurse Carla Espinoza (Judy Reyes) in this very first season. Their chemistry is very good, and like the relationship with J.D. and Turk, serves as a great story line.Sarah Chalke is the third intern of the group, nervous Elliot Reed. She has serious issues in many walks of her life, including guys and her family. She is very unsure of herself, and of the three characters, remains the most unsure of herself as the season goes on. Her character is great and works well off of the rest of the cast. She and J.D.'s ever-changing relationship is just one more story that flows throughout the season, and as the years go on, through other seasons.John C. McGinley is great as Dr. Perry Cox, a senior doctor on the staff, who enjoys giving all the interns a hard time, but he finds J.D. particularly amusing, constantly referring to him as any number of girls' names. He does have a respect for the young doctor and that is shown at a number of points in the season, but his great comic chops are what make him one of the funniest guys on television. His back and forth with chief of staff Bob Kelso (Ken Jenkins) is also a lot of fun.While he wasn't a credited star in the first season, one of the best characters on the show is the janitor, played by Neil Flynn. There really is no way to describe his sense of humor, you just have to see it for yourself.Recurring stars Sam Lloyd (Ted the lawyer), Robert Machio (The Todd) and Christa Miller-Lawrence (Jordan Sullivan, Cox's ex-wife) add some great moments to the show and guest stars Brendan Fraser and John Ritter are fantastic in their limited roles on the show.This set also includes a great stock of extras, including commentaries by creator Bill Lawrence and a number of different cast members. There is also a feature looking at the cast before they were ""Scrubs,"" plus many interviews with crew and cast members. These extras really make this DVD set shine.For a great comedy, one that doesn't get the attention that it often deserves, pick up this set. It is well worth the price.",5,You gotta love the janitor. . .,1124755200,"08 23, 2005",2005,3307,"['Scrubs', 'one', 'shows', ""n't"", 'get', 'ratings', 'deserves', 'often', ""n't"", 'get', 'attention', 'when', 'recognition', 'award', 'shows.That', 'did', 'change', 'little', 'year', 'when', 'show', 'received', 'nominations', 'look', 'back', 'first', 'season', 'where', 'smart', 'very', 'funny', 'show', 'got', 'roots', 'how', 'everything', 'got', 'started.The', 'show', 'life', 'trio', 'interns', 'enter', 'first', 'jobs', 'Sacred', 'Heart', 'hospital', 'Zach', 'Braff', 'series', 'main', 'star', 'John', 'J.D', 'Dorian', 'who', 'voice', 'overs', 'much', 'show', 'additionally', 'show', 'written', 'mainly', 'perspective', 'obvious', 'titles', 'episode', 'Hero', 'Last', 'Day', 'etc', 'Braff', 'great', 'actor', 'character', 'really', 'well', 'first', 'season', 'doctor', 'probably', 'point', 'life', 'J.D', 'pretty', 'nervous', 'unsure', 'Braff', 'projects', 'innocence', 'season', 'moves', 'along', 'growing', 'confidence', 'very', 'well.Donald', 'Faison', 'J.D', 'best', 'friend', 'Chris', 'Turk', 'surgical', 'intern', 'two', 'roomates', 'have', 'been', 'friends', 'years', 'relationship', 'great', 'catalyst', 'humerous', 'moments', 'serious', 'issues', 'Turk', 'relationship', 'nurse', 'Carla', 'Espinoza', 'Judy', 'Reyes', 'very', 'first', 'season', 'chemistry', 'very', 'good', 'relationship', 'J.D', 'Turk', 'great', 'story', 'line.Sarah', 'Chalke', 'third', 'intern', 'group', 'nervous', 'Elliot', 'Reed', 'serious', 'issues', 'many', 'walks', 'life', 'including', 'guys', 'family', 'very', 'unsure', 'herself', 'three', 'characters', 'most', 'unsure', 'season', 'character', 'great', 'well', 'rest', 'cast', 'J.D', 'ever-changing', 'relationship', 'just', 'one', 'more', 'story', 'season', 'years', 'go', 'other', 'seasons.John', 'C.', 'McGinley', 'great', 'Dr.', 'Perry', 'Cox', 'senior', 'doctor', 'staff', 'who', 'giving', 'interns', 'hard', 'time', 'J.D', 'particularly', 'amusing', 'constantly', 'referring', 'number', 'girls', 'names', 'have', 'respect', 'young', 'doctor', 'shown', 'number', 'points', 'season', 'great', 'comic', 'chops', 'are', 'what', 'make', 'one', 'funniest', 'guys', 'television', 'back', 'forth', 'chief', 'staff', 'Bob', 'Kelso', 'Ken', 'Jenkins', 'also', 'lot', 'fun.While', 'was', ""n't"", 'credited', 'star', 'first', 'season', 'one', 'best', 'characters', 'show', 'janitor', 'played', 'Neil', 'Flynn', 'really', 'way', 'describe', 'sense', 'humor', 'just', 'have', 'see', 'yourself.Recurring', 'stars', 'Sam', 'Lloyd', 'Ted', 'lawyer', 'Robert', 'Machio', 'Todd', 'Christa', 'Miller-Lawrence', 'Jordan', 'Sullivan', 'Cox', 'ex-wife', 'add', 'great', 'moments', 'show', 'guest', 'stars', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'John', 'Ritter', 'are', 'fantastic', 'limited', 'roles', 'show.This', 'set', 'also', 'great', 'stock', 'extras', 'including', 'commentaries', 'creator', 'Bill', 'Lawrence', 'number', 'different', 'cast', 'members', 'also', 'feature', 'looking', 'cast', 'were', 'Scrubs', 'many', 'interviews', 'crew', 'cast', 'members', 'extras', 'really', 'make', 'DVD', 'set', 'shine.For', 'great', 'comedy', 'one', ""n't"", 'get', 'attention', 'often', 'pick', 'up', 'set', 'well', 'price']",Scrubs - The Complete First Season

The nightly doses tie the serialized elements of the show together much better and that opens up an entirely new level of jokes to the viewer. I've since torn through three seasons of DVD and it only gets better and better.I had watched only a handful of first-run eps over the years but had never really bought into the series. I had been mildly amused at the over-the-top antics but somewhat put off by the almost frat-boyish obsession with ""adult"" humor and with getting Sarah Chalke into her underwear. (It seemed she went shirtless at least every other episode. Although I really enjoy seeing a beautiful woman in her bra, I had a nagging concern that it needlessly exploited her character.)Apart from that, the writing, the acting, the commitment to colorful and deeply human characterization, and the often compelling portrayal of our collective foibles and nobility is arresting to say the least.

Kinda like the worst aspects ofFriendsandHappy Days- glib eye candy.But, oh boy, how wrong was I! It turns out that the comedy is far more understated and subtle, and that it is balanced by its natural dark twin; tragedy. The story lines do not back away from sometimes having a sad moral, with the season ending being a wonderful example of this.Oh, and, best of all, there is no canned laughter! Nope - not one single snigger - a joke is a joke, whether you notice it or not, and it is not your gullible duty to laugh at it...And there are also the characters. From the extremely witty Dr Cox, to the brainy bimbo Elliot, there is depth and insight into the charactors, and they are not all Zack Braff-esque, which makes the interplay surprising and interesting. There are also well-cast cameos in the form of the Janitor's dad as the drill sergeant fromFull Metal Jacket, among others.So, overall Scrubs is definitely worth a watch and, considering it has 24 episodes in the series, it is a bargain as well!Trouble is of course, if the Americans have learned the art of Irony, Drama and consistently good writing, what place is there now for British Sitcoms?

She said that it was unrealistic and ridiculous.  While I think that Scrubs is BY FAR the funniest comedy to ever bless the wasteland of entertainment we call TV, I'm not suprised that she hated it.  Scrubs is outrageous and quirky and, at times, ridiculous.  For a viewer who doesn't want to look past the initial presentation, the show would most likely be unbearable.For me, Scrubs is so much more.  There's a complexity to the show that is so easily missed.  So many viewers want simplicity...instant laughs and easily discernible jokes.  Scrubs provides an ample supply of those, but its greatest success lay in its amplification of human foibles and idiosyncracies.  Viewers likely will be treated with manifestations of a character's conciousness or multi-layered dialogues.

Each episode is a perfect little jewel of humor, music, and meaning.  You have to pay close attention, or you'll miss something happening in the background, or some chance comment, or hilarious leap of consciousness.  The soundtrack, a great mix for this millennium, is better than Garden State or Shrek, both of which were also great.  And for meaning - ""My Old Lady"" has more emotional content, delivered with just that little necessary vinegar, than any overly wrought ER episode.  I am a nurse, and Scrubs catches more of the reality of a hospital environment than any of the dramas, especially the nighttime soap Greys Anatomy.

The commentaries are also actually interesting unlike most other DVD sets. (I found it interesting that Neil Flynn who plays the Janitor ab libs almost all his lines).The reason that NBC always shovels it around and doesn't advertise it is because the show is owned by Disney.  Therefore it is Disney who ultimately profits from the show.  Thus NBC would much rather spend money to advertise one of its own shows, and they also knows that no matter how often they move Scrubs, us loyal fans will always seek it out.  I still think it was a low blow that theyre not including this in the intial line-up for fall (it'll come along later as a midseason replacement).

Things happening in a hospital surprisingly makes for a fun watch.The show centers on J.D., an intern in Sacred Heart. He is joined by his close buddy, Turk. He makes weird connections with his fellow intern, Elliot. They are joined by Turk's girlfriend, Carla. Secondary characters like Dr. Cox (J.D.'s idol), the janitor who apparently enjoys tailing J.D and teasing him as well as a balding lawyer who goes out of his way to educate doctors about avaoiding lawsuits are really a hoot to watch.I agree with most reviewers that this is a really entertaining show. Every episode, we are given crazy scenarios in the hospital and sometimes the personal lives of the interns, and in the heart of it, there will be a lesson to be learnt. However, many people hail it as different and creative, which unfortunately I have to disagree. The ""thinking from a third person"" approach has been done to death in shows like Ally McBeal. Certain characters also depicts characters from other TV shows, like there is a huge resemblance of Dr. Cox to Dr. Becker, from the show ""Becker"". However, this doesn't really matter because these elements incorporated from different shows come together very well for Scrubs, in fact better than the shows that introduced them. So, you end up having a really good time.Scrubs has obtained huge success, having been through 4 seasons and still looking strong. Personally, I wouldn't say this is the best comedy out there, I enjoy ""Friends"" and ""Arrested Development"" much more than Scrubs.

This year, so far, it's a no show and that's something my entire family is missing. The episodes, when they're finally aired, are only run once, no reruns due to the amount of television that's squeezed through the AFN network. Anyway, we LOVE this show. It's very clever, funny, sad, ironic and, well, suffice it to say it's sincerely a joy to watch. That and it re-introduced me to Colin Hay, hey! I could not be happier that this excellent series is finally making it to DVD.Did I mention that it's laugh out loud funny? But it's also a comedy with a lot of heart and wonderful observations about the human condition, that being that yeah we're screwed up but we are trying to do better. As the new docs interning at a large metropolitan hospital these guys have to deal with politics of the hospital the needs of the patients, the egos of the older doctors and staff as well as their own struggles as individuals in a cookie cutter society. Trying to achieve a workable compromise is no easy job and the mistakes can be both funny and tragic. The balance that's made with this series is that it is a serious subject with a manic core. It's a comedy about what's most feared and hoped.

630394,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00005JNEQ,Robert Moore,"[1, 1]","I only recently discovered SCRUBS after complaining to several people that if ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT didn't find a new home I wouldn't know what I would do for laughs on TV.  After a couple said that SCRUBS shared a number of ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT's qualities, I decided to give it a try.  Living in the age of the DVD picking up a show several seasons into its run is a piece of cake.  I can now agree with my friends that this, with ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT, the best comedy currently running on TV.Everyone has personal biases and mine regarding TV are shows dealing with cops, lawyers, and hospitals.  That unfortunately cuts a wide swathe in the genre and is one of the reasons I had never wanted to give the show a try.  Its hospital setting remains one thing I don't like about it.  But I love everything else.  The show is driven both by brilliant writing, a strong ensemble cast, and a great production team.  It also shares one quality with ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT that tragically only a few television comedies actually possess:  it is funny.  It doesn't elicit nearly as many belly laughs as ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT, but on the other hand it has many more serious moments that the other show never tries to achieve.  It strives for a slightly different alchemy.The first season is built around the adventures of three interns at Sacred Heart Hospital:  John ""JD"" Dorian (played winningly by Zach Braff, whom I previously knew from GARDEN STATE), Elliott Reid (Sarah Chalke), and Christopher Turk (Donald Faison).  They are under the tutelage of the tyrannical hospital head Dr. Bob Kelso (Ken Jenkins).  Dorian gains a mentor in Dr. Perry Cox, played by John C. McGinley, who manages to steal just about ever scene he is in.  The cast is rounded out by Judy Reyes, who plays Nurse Carla Espinosa, who becomes romantically involved with Turk and Neil Flynn, who plays the Janitor.  All in all, it is a superb cast and is supplemented both by a number of regular guest stars, such as Christa Miller, who plays Dr. Cox's ex-wife Jordan and hospital board member, and Robert Maschio, who plays the high-fiving surgery intern Todd.  There are also a number of excellent guest appearances by familiar actors, most notably WILL AND GRACE's Sean Hayes and Brendan Fraser, who plays Jordan's brother.The show loves to stretch the boundaries of what you can do with fantasy sequences and intentional absurdities.  What is remarkable is how often these efforts succeed.  In this regard the show is similar to shows like ALLY MCBEAL (the show that established the use of frequent fantasy in comedy).Now that we have DVDs there is absolutely no reason for anyone to avoid getting into this first-rate comedy.

When it first came out, I thought it would be another throw-away show that didn't last a half a season.  There were plenty of medical dramas and there had been some attempts at medical humor that had failed miserably among the few gems.Scrubs is different than most shows that are on TV.  It is a sitcom without a laugh track.  It is quirky but not to excess.  There are oddball characters that you can care about and laugh at.  It has its schmaltzy moments but they rarely go over the edge.  Just enough to hit the right emotional buttons at the right time.  The humor ranges from very intelligent to juvenile but it is a good mix for everyone and, ultimately, it all seems intelligent in the end because of that balance.Besides the writing, one of the best things about this show is the casting.  The regulars were mostly unknowns with some character actors that you might recognize from other roles (but maybe not because they are great at becoming the character, like Dr. Cox, also seen in Office Space as one of the Bobs).  And the guest star casting is inspired, if not genius, 99% of the time.As always, not everyone will like a show and Scrubs is no different.  The first season involves a little time for the series to get its legs but it does so quickly so early episodes are up-to-speed and not as klunky as in other series.  You'll notice this when you compare then to the later seasons.  Another thing you'll notice is that the ""riskier"" concept shows come in later but that isn't unusual.Overall, a great show and worth a shot if you haven't seen it before.  Give it a chance because you don't see stuff like this very often.  I hope the extras on the DVD help add to this show.

And this week I've just started rewatching it again.The series deffinately holds up over time. It doesn't feel dated and unworthy of my more refined, older, TV palet.I enjoy it just as much as the initial run.It's fun to see the characters that you know so well by now starting over from the beginning. The real magic of the show, that I didn't appreciate originally, was how the characters and their relationships were preplanned from the beginning. This show was not filled with characters who the writers let evolve and progress randomly. You can see from the beginning that every character was crafted into a polished final form before the first episode was aired. (Cox is an ass, but a great doctor who legitimately cares abotu his patients, Carla is a tough as nails nurse, Kelso is the devil, etc) Same goes for the relationships between the characters (Cox respects JD but doesn't want anyone to know it. The Janitor hates JD and wants everyone to know it. Turk is in love with Carla, so is Cox. etc)This makes the show seem more real. Often in a series that has a long run the characters become charicatures of themselves, with their most poular traits being exploited to the point where it's just goofy (see Sheldon on the Big Bang Theory, Cliff Claven on Cheers, and any Simpsons character). But the Scrubs characters all have their unique traits that stay pretty much the same over the 8 year run, just like real people. Sure their change a little, but not dramatically.This lets you restart the series and immediately recognize the characters in episode 1 just like you left them after episode 200. When characters change too much the show becomes a different series. You dont' recognize the same characters in season 1 when you go back. (For example if youv'e watched Community from the start, go back and watch season 1 episodes now.

630403,A36Y2UJIH0L3E2,B00005JNEQ,"S. Lee ""Art Not in Heaven""","[5, 6]","I bought Scrubs Season 1 DVD about a year ago. Before that, I never saw the show on TV. That Zach Braff is in it, as one of the main characters, was reassuring. And I read a review somewhere, which was mentioning the show's ""quirky sense of humor."" With this, I could sort of picture a medical drama with a Garden State-type of humor. A drama that has ""real"" people as its characters, that finds laughs in mundane details and combines it with a unique pathos, or at times, insights. If the show can meet half the expectation I have, I wouldn't be painfully disappointed, I figured and bought the DVD.Then I was amazed and really pleased. While basically being a show I expected, Scrubs went far beyond my expectation. I remember my gasping, on the first viewing, at moments that I did not really expect to see from a network TV show. These moments abound from the very first episode. For instance, when JD asks Turk if he can use the ""extremely volatile racial slur,"" that is the ""n""-word, when he sings a rap song. Or when he tells Eliot that she should ""tease"" Turk for his being black. Or Carla's retort when JD compliments Turk for his starting to have sex with her on a regular basis (""My man Turk is now getting it daily, nightly, and ever so rightly""): ""why do you automatically assume that he and I are having sex? Do latina women put out more?""These moments are refreshing and can even be taken as culturally significant because they may signal a certain degree of freedom from the kind of political correctness we are assumed to conform to as to the issue of someone's race. These moments are also endearing because they do *not* appeal to the racial stereotypes or prejudices we may have but invite us to rethink about them. In this regard, at least, I think Scrubs is far superior to Grey's Anatomy, another medical drama where racial issues are not really candidly or thoughtfully dealt with.If you choose to look at it that way, every show (or movie, or novel, for that matter) is about three things: race, gender, and class. Scrubs' way of dealing with these three issues is amazingly original and mature. While having hard laughs, you find yourself rethinking about the notions you previously held as to these, and beginning to think of what the show is really saying. Of course, Scrubs is not an ""issue"" show. Far from it.

She was a pleasant suprise despite me liking Lecy Goranson on Roseanne all those years and i usually dont like cast replacements.  Sara Chalk was different, even though i liked Lecy Goranson very much.  She is so adorable.  That smile of hers is truly contagious.When she flashes the little boy to make his heartbeat speed up and decided that they could save lives I was cracking up.The show isnt the best in the world.  Im a huge Big Bang Theory fan and I heard a comment on there about how everyone would like Scrubs and so i checked it out, as i do with many things they comment on, on the show.  I really liked Donald Faison in ""Clueless"" but in this he kinda bores me as Turk.Zack Braffs alrightas John but I think that Dax Shepard would have been better.  Dax is funnier, has the same goofy but cute look and would have looked way better with Sara Chalk.  I think he would have made the show go from okay to downright hilarious.Sara was the funniest part of this show.It's not a bad show.  I bought season 1 and Im not gonna buy the other ones but it takes alot of big laughs to keep me watching a comedy.  I enjoy it enough to keep watching but I just dont laugh like I'd like to in a comedy and on the other side I like my medical shows light hearted but not too slapsticky. So even if it was funnier I still probably wouldn't get into it that much.  Im a Greys Anatomy fan.  Serious but laced with humor and laughs in the most oportune moments.

After seeing just a few episodes, I became an addict and SCRUBS is one of the few television shows I watch on a constant basis. The series will always be known as the show that launched Zach Braff's career. However, as talented as he is, the show has so much more to offer than just Braff. Bill Lawrence makes it a point to keep continuity in the shows he creates and develops. Because of this continuity, SCRUBS has not only a great cast of feature players, but has a great ""B-Team"" (what Lawrence calls the supporting actors) that make the show even that much more lively and entertaining. Also, unlike many of the prime time tv shows, SCRUBS has some great writing. Medical mumbo-mumbo, witty one liners, and poignant monologues are all woven together seamlessly in one conversation without dropping a beat or slowing the show's pace. In order to get a true sense of reality, SCRUBS is actually filmed in an abandoned hospital. Some of my favorite episodes in SCRUBS Season One include:""My First Day""""My Old Lady""""My Hero""""My Last Day""The last episode of the season is particularly revealing: it is JD's last day as an intern but the cast and crew thought the show was going to be cancelled and thus, despite the cliffhanger depressing ending, filmed it as their last day, too.There are less than a handful of high quality shows on tv nowadays. SCRUBS is one of the few and a person can see how it all began with SCRUBS: The Complete First Season.Besides all the first 24 episodes, the DVD set also includes a set of retrospectives by the major actors; a one-on-one session with Zach Braff talking about his experiences during the first season; a making of featurette; ""Superman"" music video by Lazlo Bane; deleted scenes; outtakes; and a few other features.",5,Keeping Prime Time Alive,1125100800,"08 27, 2005",2005,1864,"['saw', 'first', 'episode', 'SCRUBS', 'two', 'months', 'first', 'season', 'DVD', 'set', 'was', 'release', 'DVD', 'seeing', 'just', 'few', 'episodes', 'became', 'addict', 'SCRUBS', 'one', 'few', 'television', 'shows', 'watch', 'constant', 'basis', 'series', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'known', 'show', 'launched', 'Zach', 'Braff', 'career', 'However', 'as', 'talented', 'show', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'offer', 'just', 'Braff', 'Bill', 'Lawrence', 'point', 'keep', 'continuity', 'shows', 'continuity', 'SCRUBS', 'not', 'only', 'great', 'cast', 'feature', 'players', 'great', 'B-Team', 'what', 'Lawrence', 'supporting', 'actors', 'make', 'show', 'even', 'that', 'much', 'more', 'lively', 'entertaining', 'Also', 'many', 'prime', 'time', 'tv', 'shows', 'SCRUBS', 'great', 'writing', 'Medical', 'mumbo-mumbo', 'witty', 'one', 'liners', 'poignant', 'monologues', 'are', 'woven', 'together', 'seamlessly', 'one', 'conversation', 'dropping', 'beat', 'slowing', 'show', 'pace', 'order', 'get', 'true', 'sense', 'reality', 'SCRUBS', 'actually', 'filmed', 'abandoned', 'hospital', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'SCRUBS', 'Season', 'One', 'include', 'First', 'Day', 'Old', 'Lady', 'Hero', 'Last', 'Day', 'last', 'episode', 'season', 'particularly', 'revealing', 'JD', 'last', 'day', 'intern', 'cast', 'crew', 'thought', 'show', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'cancelled', 'thus', 'cliffhanger', 'depressing', 'ending', 'filmed', 'last', 'day', 'are', 'less', 'handful', 'high', 'quality', 'shows', 'tv', 'nowadays', 'SCRUBS', 'one', 'few', 'person', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'began', 'SCRUBS', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season.Besides', 'first', '24', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'set', 'also', 'set', 'retrospectives', 'major', 'actors', 'one-on-one', 'session', 'Zach', 'Braff', 'talking', 'experiences', 'first', 'season', 'making', 'featurette', 'Superman', 'music', 'video', 'Lazlo', 'Bane', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'outtakes', 'few', 'other', 'features']",Scrubs - The Complete First Season

I have always been curious as to how JD, Elliot, and Turk got started at Sacred Heart, and whether Dr Cox and Dr Kelso have always been a couple of taskmasters from the beginning. The first season DVD answered a lot of those questions. There are scenes that are worth watching over. This set is the perfect thing to put into your DVD player on a rainy day.NBC recently announced that Scrubs will return for a fifth season, but beyond that is anyone's guess. It is well-known that despite that this show is well received by fans and critics alike, NBC is doing very little to promote the show.

630414,A3T8QNAEQ4SW7R,B00005JNEQ,Vain Saints,"[2, 8]","The advantages of the show are the jokes and the authenticity of the setting.  (Or at least, authentic enough to fool me.)  Every once in awhile, you get a truly brilliant moment, like when it's revealed that the janitor really is stalking JD. They get points for trying to issue a commentary on medicine, but they pull their punches so scrupulously that on the whole, it comes in as neutral.Now the weaknesses,1.  Excessive, maudlin, overt sentimentality:  Practically every episode ends with an extensive monologue where one of the female characters (Eliot, Carla, or John Dorian...you'll see what I mean) blathers on about her feelings and what they learned from the episode as the interpersonal conflict is resolved.  An overwhelming number of episodes result in such underwhelming climaxes of pedantry.  Worse, these climaxes are done over sad-sack emo music, just in case the characters pretty much narrating their melodramas doesn't quite drive the point home enough.2. This wouldn't be as much of a problem if the characters weren't so damn annoying.  I can barely stand any of these people.  I do not sympathize with their fake, contrived problems.  JD is a combination dork and whiny little pansy (who ridiculously pulls in leading ladies on a regular basis).  You can see the writers trying desperately to take any source of conflict, no matter how trivial or pedestrian, and concoct from it an epic personal drama, because otherwise, there would be no plot.  The simple words ""Get over yourself"" would force the entire series either to radically transform itself or to end.One of the virtues of setting a show in a hospital is that the doctors supposedly have little time to whine about their relationships and to learn trite life lessons.  Life Lessons don't work when you have to learn them on a weekly basis (daily in syndication).  The best sitcoms (Married With Children, Arrested Development, South Park) work precisely because their characters, for the most part, don't learn anything.  On the contrary, they keep upping the ante.  That's half the joke.Ultimately, this show's problem is that it's not really a comedy show.  It's General Hospital with a lot of (often very good) comic relief.  But there is a difference between a soap-opera that employs a lot of humor and a genuine comedy.  Here's one hint.  In a comedy, it's OK to laugh with your characters sometimes, but you better damn well make sure that we're mostly laughing AT them, and it's hard to have a show where you want us to root for the characters and where we laugh at them at the same time.  Who are we rooting for in Seinfeld?  This show is at its best when the characters are irredeemable.  The symbol of comedy in this show is the fat kid who eats Turk's ring.  A comedy can't afford for the audience to care if he dies from childhood diabetes.  If this is a comedy, and he gets diabetes, it'd better be some funny diabetes.Truly the best real comedy potential in this show as it stands is how seriously these people take themselves.  I could laugh at that all day.  Unfortunately, that potential is not utilized.",3,"Very Funny, but Serious Flaws",1310256000,"07 10, 2011",2011,3106,"['advantages', 'show', 'are', 'jokes', 'authenticity', 'setting', 'least', 'authentic', 'enough', 'fool', 'once', 'awhile', 'get', 'truly', 'brilliant', 'moment', 'when', 'revealed', 'janitor', 'really', 'stalking', 'JD', 'get', 'points', 'trying', 'issue', 'commentary', 'medicine', 'pull', 'punches', 'so', 'scrupulously', 'whole', 'as', 'weaknesses,1', 'Excessive', 'maudlin', 'overt', 'sentimentality', 'Practically', 'episode', 'extensive', 'monologue', 'where', 'one', 'female', 'characters', 'Eliot', 'Carla', 'John', 'Dorian', ""'ll"", 'see', 'what', 'mean', 'blathers', 'feelings', 'what', 'learned', 'episode', 'interpersonal', 'conflict', 'resolved', 'overwhelming', 'number', 'episodes', 'result', 'such', 'underwhelming', 'climaxes', 'pedantry', 'Worse', 'climaxes', 'are', 'done', 'sad-sack', 'emo', 'music', 'just', 'case', 'characters', 'pretty', 'much', 'narrating', 'melodramas', ""n't"", 'quite', 'drive', 'point', 'home', 'enough.2', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'as', 'much', 'problem', 'characters', 'were', ""n't"", 'so', 'damn', 'annoying', 'can', 'barely', 'stand', 'people', 'do', 'not', 'sympathize', 'fake', 'contrived', 'problems', 'JD', 'combination', 'dork', 'whiny', 'little', 'pansy', 'who', 'ridiculously', 'leading', 'ladies', 'regular', 'basis', 'can', 'see', 'writers', 'trying', 'desperately', 'take', 'source', 'conflict', 'matter', 'how', 'trivial', 'pedestrian', 'concoct', 'epic', 'personal', 'drama', 'otherwise', 'would', 'be', 'plot', 'simple', 'words', 'Get', 'would', 'force', 'entire', 'series', 'either', 'radically', 'transform', 'end.One', 'virtues', 'setting', 'show', 'hospital', 'doctors', 'supposedly', 'have', 'little', 'time', 'whine', 'relationships', 'learn', 'trite', 'life', 'lessons', 'Life', 'Lessons', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'when', 'have', 'learn', 'weekly', 'basis', 'daily', 'syndication', 'best', 'sitcoms', 'Married', 'Children', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'South', 'Park', 'work', 'precisely', 'characters', 'most', 'part', 'do', ""n't"", 'learn', 'anything', 'contrary', 'keep', 'upping', 'ante', 'joke.Ultimately', 'show', 'problem', 'not', 'really', 'comedy', 'show', 'General', 'Hospital', 'lot', 'often', 'very', 'good', 'comic', 'relief', 'difference', 'soap-opera', 'lot', 'humor', 'genuine', 'comedy', 'Here', 'one', 'hint', 'comedy', 'OK', 'laugh', 'characters', 'sometimes', 'better', 'damn', 'well', 'make', 'sure', ""'re"", 'mostly', 'laughing', 'AT', 'hard', 'have', 'show', 'where', 'want', 'root', 'characters', 'where', 'laugh', 'same', 'time', 'Who', 'are', 'rooting', 'Seinfeld', 'show', 'best', 'when', 'characters', 'are', 'irredeemable', 'symbol', 'comedy', 'show', 'fat', 'kid', 'who', 'Turk', 'ring', 'comedy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'audience', 'care', 'childhood', 'diabetes', 'comedy', ""'d"", 'better', 'be', 'funny', 'best', 'real', 'comedy', 'potential', 'show', 'how', 'seriously', 'people', 'take', 'could', 'laugh', 'day', 'Unfortunately', 'potential', 'not', 'utilized']",Scrubs - The Complete First Season

Maybe it is an ""in joke"" thing at times, I'm a registered nurse in an emergency department, and I can totally relate to most of it.  In fact, I find Scrubs far more realistic than any other medical TV series.  Friends don't believe me when I say that, but it's true.  Believe me, I now doctors just like JD, Elliot, Kelso, Perry and Turk and I know many nurses just like Carla.  Sometimes I watch Scrubs thinking ""oh my God, I've done that"".  I especially like it when it shows the characters thinking one thing, then cuts back to see them smile sweetly and say something completely different - yes, nurses do that all the time.

630417,AP3B615GM191G,B00005JNEQ,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[2, 6]","Ever on the lookout for a new television show (my favorite entertainment genre), I decided to give Scrubs a try after catching up on ""The Office"" DVDs.  Though not thoroughly disappointed or anything like that, after completing this entire first season I am very ambivalent about continuing on with the series.Basically, the show revolves around four hospital interns (narrated from the perspective of Zach Braff's ""J.D."" character) and their crazy experiences.  Auxiliary characters include the crotchety old Chief of Medicine, the tortured, tough-guy image Doctor, and the mysterious janitor who thrives on making life as miserable as possible for J.D.  While the show is obviously a comedy at heart, it also contains a strong human-interest aspect that sees its characters grow throughout the season, not just remain static from episode to episode.However, the ""problem"" with this show (though not by any internal error) is that it doesn't measure up to its contemporaries in its two key departments: cut-away gags and the character-driven angle.  In terms of the types of jokes (cut-away mock-ups, primarily) most often used, the show pales in comparison to Family Guy's hilarious randomness.  Plus, that human-interest angle just isn't as compelling as the cast of The Office.Thus, although the first season of Scrubs is decent enough when evaluated on its own, it just doesn't live up to others currently on the air.  Those who are easily offended by the material of Family Guy will appreciate the tamer atmosphere of this show (while continuing with the cut-away gags), but otherwise you might find it a bit boring and stagnant.Perhaps sometime in the future I will return to the series to see if the writing/characters are amped up a notch, but right now I am content to leave off after Season One and stick with my other fare.",3,Doesn't Live Up To Comedy Contemporaries,1268870400,"03 18, 2010",2010,1835,"['Ever', 'lookout', 'new', 'television', 'show', 'favorite', 'entertainment', 'genre', 'decided', 'give', 'Scrubs', 'try', 'catching', 'up', 'Office', 'DVDs', 'not', 'thoroughly', 'disappointed', 'anything', 'completing', 'entire', 'first', 'season', 'am', 'very', 'ambivalent', 'continuing', 'series.Basically', 'show', 'around', 'four', 'hospital', 'interns', 'narrated', 'perspective', 'Zach', 'Braff', 'J.D', 'character', 'crazy', 'experiences', 'Auxiliary', 'characters', 'include', 'crotchety', 'old', 'Chief', 'Medicine', 'tortured', 'tough-guy', 'image', 'Doctor', 'mysterious', 'janitor', 'who', 'making', 'life', 'as', 'miserable', 'possible', 'J.D', 'show', 'obviously', 'comedy', 'heart', 'also', 'strong', 'human-interest', 'aspect', 'characters', 'grow', 'season', 'not', 'just', 'remain', 'static', 'episode', 'episode.However', 'problem', 'show', 'not', 'internal', 'error', ""n't"", 'measure', 'up', 'contemporaries', 'two', 'key', 'departments', 'cut-away', 'gags', 'character-driven', 'angle', 'terms', 'types', 'jokes', 'cut-away', 'mock-ups', 'primarily', 'most', 'often', 'used', 'show', 'comparison', 'Family', 'Guy', 'hilarious', 'randomness', 'human-interest', 'angle', 'just', ""n't"", 'as', 'compelling', 'cast', 'Office.Thus', 'first', 'season', 'Scrubs', 'decent', 'enough', 'when', 'evaluated', 'own', 'just', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'others', 'currently', 'air', 'who', 'are', 'easily', 'offended', 'material', 'Family', 'Guy', 'will', 'appreciate', 'tamer', 'atmosphere', 'show', 'continuing', 'cut-away', 'gags', 'otherwise', 'might', 'find', 'bit', 'boring', 'stagnant.Perhaps', 'sometime', 'future', 'will', 'return', 'series', 'see', 'writing/characters', 'are', 'amped', 'up', 'notch', 'right', 'now', 'am', 'content', 'leave', 'off', 'Season', 'One', 'stick', 'other', 'fare']",Scrubs - The Complete First Season
