While it suffers from the fact that the narration does at time distract from the music it is superb and one wishes that there would have been some more music. Lane had an incredible career and some very famous friends. Here we get to see the beginnings of the Smal, Faces on which too little time is spent and then the time with Rod Stewart in the Faces is dealt with rather shortly as well. This is probably normal since the film is more interested in his time with Slim Chance which is grat. Indeed there are other DVDs dealing with the more successful periods of his life. Slim Chance was the band he formed in order to perform a very different kind of music away from the mainstream then. It was folky gypsy-like music. Personally I came into contact with Lane through the album Rough Mix with Townshend which is simply splendid and which is referred to here. I discovered the Slim Chance LPs at the store Back to Mono and they were fantastic records, quite unique and they had this unique blend of folk and traditional music such as country that made them really great. This decision, while artistically great, was commercially a folly and he went bankrupt of course. All this is recounted in great detail by his friends such as Clapton, Townshend and Glyn Johns among others. we get to follow the great man s career as well as his battle against multiple sclerosis. This is a great documentary in the vein of what British television does best and serves as agreat tribute to a unique artist.",5,splendid,1282262400,"08 20, 2010",2010,1620,"['Ronnie', 'Lane', 'was', 'one', 'kind', 'excellent', 'musical', 'biography', 'DVD', 'fact', 'one', 'best', 'have', 'seen', 'while', 'fact', 'narration', 'time', 'distract', 'music', 'superb', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'music', 'Lane', 'had', 'incredible', 'career', 'very', 'famous', 'friends', 'Here', 'get', 'see', 'beginnings', 'Smal', 'Faces', 'too', 'little', 'time', 'spent', 'then', 'time', 'Rod', 'Stewart', 'Faces', 'dealt', 'rather', 'shortly', 'as', 'well', 'probably', 'normal', 'film', 'more', 'interested', 'time', 'Slim', 'Chance', 'grat', 'Indeed', 'are', 'other', 'DVDs', 'dealing', 'more', 'successful', 'periods', 'life', 'Slim', 'Chance', 'was', 'band', 'formed', 'order', 'perform', 'very', 'different', 'kind', 'music', 'away', 'mainstream', 'then', 'was', 'folky', 'gypsy-like', 'music', 'Personally', 'came', 'contact', 'Lane', 'album', 'Rough', 'Mix', 'Townshend', 'simply', 'splendid', 'referred', 'here', 'discovered', 'Slim', 'Chance', 'LPs', 'store', 'Back', 'Mono', 'were', 'fantastic', 'records', 'quite', 'unique', 'had', 'unique', 'blend', 'folk', 'traditional', 'music', 'such', 'country', 'made', 'really', 'great', 'decision', 'artistically', 'great', 'was', 'commercially', 'folly', 'went', 'bankrupt', 'course', 'recounted', 'great', 'detail', 'friends', 'such', 'Clapton', 'Townshend', 'Glyn', 'Johns', 'others', 'get', 'follow', 'great', 'man', 'career', 'as', 'well', 'battle', 'multiple', 'sclerosis', 'great', 'documentary', 'vein', 'what', 'British', 'television', 'best', 'agreat', 'tribute', 'unique', 'artist']",The Passing Show - The Life & Music of Ronnie Lane

1022178,AVT3O4GVXV5L9,B000ION7CG,Ms. Felicia Davis-burden,"[2, 4]","Ronnie Lane was a complicated mix, for such a little guy! So much talent and so many contradictions; stubbornness tempered by philosophical humour; natural musicianship displayed with winning warmth; dazzling success followed by crushing hardship, feckless lunacy followed by hard-fought hereditory illness (Ronnie's mother had also battled Multiple Sclerosis). Ronnie braved everything life threw at him.This engaging and often funny film traces Ronnie's amazing life, with insights from relatives and musician friends such as Pete Townshend (who shared RL's devotion to the mystic Meher Baba), Eric Clapton and Ian Maclagan. Interviewed in 1987, Ronnie provides much of the narration himself; laughing and finally quoting Meher Baba, 'Life is just a passing show'.This is fascinating programme, peppered with many beautiful musical excerpts from Ronnie's time in Small Faces, The Faces and a solo career that should have been more successful.

1022180,A1IP7XHSXLGKZB,B000ION7CG,Statman,"[0, 0]","The Passing Show is a superb introduction to the singular musical vision of Ronnie Lane. Ronnie believed in life, music, friends, and having a good time, despite tremendous obstacles and hardships. You'll definitely want some Ronnie Lane music to accompany this. I would recommend starting with Just for a Moment, You Can Never Tell, or Kuschty Rye depending mainly on which is more easily available. Rocket 69 is a fine live performance, while his four original albums are also all good. Of course, his Small Faces (esp. Ogden's Nut Gone Flake), Faces (esp. A Nod is as Good as a Wink), and collaborations (esp. Rough Mix), are also good to excellent, although his solo recordings probably offer more insight into his musical personality vision. But, even if you are not familiar with, or perhaps don't care that much for, Ronnie Lane's music, the Passing Show is still a highly entertaining movie.",5,Superb Rock Biography,1265241600,"02 4, 2010",2010,899,"['Passing', 'Show', 'superb', 'introduction', 'singular', 'musical', 'vision', 'Ronnie', 'Lane', 'Ronnie', 'believed', 'life', 'music', 'friends', 'having', 'good', 'time', 'tremendous', 'obstacles', 'hardships', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'want', 'Ronnie', 'Lane', 'music', 'accompany', 'would', 'recommend', 'starting', 'Just', 'Moment', 'Can', 'Never', 'Tell', 'Kuschty', 'Rye', 'depending', 'mainly', 'more', 'easily', 'available', 'Rocket', '69', 'fine', 'live', 'performance', 'four', 'original', 'albums', 'are', 'also', 'good', 'course', 'Small', 'Faces', 'esp', 'Ogden', 'Nut', 'Gone', 'Flake', 'Faces', 'esp', 'Nod', 'as', 'Good', 'Wink', 'collaborations', 'esp', 'Rough', 'Mix', 'are', 'also', 'good', 'excellent', 'solo', 'recordings', 'probably', 'offer', 'more', 'insight', 'musical', 'personality', 'vision', 'even', 'are', 'not', 'familiar', 'perhaps', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'that', 'much', 'Ronnie', 'Lane', 'music', 'Passing', 'Show', 'still', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'movie']",The Passing Show - The Life & Music of Ronnie Lane
1022181,A199T3IWULDX68,B000ION7CG,"Thirty-Ought Six ""music fiend""","[1, 1]","This tribute disc offers an insightful overview of the life and music of Ronnie Lane, former Small Faces/Faces bassist, vocalist and songwriter. Oddly, there are no interview excerpts featuring Rod Stewart or Ron Wood, but there are inputs from Ronnie's other Faces bandmates Ian Maclagan and Kenny Jones, as well as important notes and comments from Pete Townshend, Eric Clapton, Ronnie's brother Stan, and also the man himself. This visual biography traces the roots of Ronnie's upbringing, his passion for music which eventually led to the formation of the Small Faces with Steve Marriott, onto the Faces with Rod and Ronnie and into his solo career with Slim Chance. The focus on his infliction with Multiple Sclerosis paints a picture of sorrow, frustration, determination and optimism all rolled into a fascinating portrait of a man whose sometimes stubborness, worked for and against himself in the process. There are snippets of tv and bootleg video archival footage of Lane with the Small Faces, Faces and Slim Chance as well as the Rough Mix, ARMS and solo projects he continued to pursue until the end of his life; my only major gripe is that there isn't any bonus bits from the 70's when he was still strong enough to play without the MS afflicting his abilities. I was half expecting to see some solo perfomances isolated as there is footage available on YouTube with Slim Chance and the Faces, but perhaps that will be unearthed later on down the road. The bonus features do have performances by people who knew and played with him in the past and their interpretations of his songs are heartfelt and bittersweet, so at least the producers were able to offer up these in tandem as a tribute to the man himself. For Fans of the Faces/Small Faces, this disc is highly recommended, and for fans of late 60's/early 70's British Rock whom haven't associated with Ronnie Lane or the Faces, this disc could very well convert you into being a loyal fan. 4 solid stars",4,Nice and Insightful DVD,1369094400,"05 21, 2013",2013,1973,"['tribute', 'disc', 'insightful', 'overview', 'life', 'music', 'Ronnie', 'Lane', 'former', 'Small', 'Faces/Faces', 'bassist', 'vocalist', 'songwriter', 'Oddly', 'are', 'interview', 'featuring', 'Rod', 'Stewart', 'Ron', 'Wood', 'are', 'inputs', 'Ronnie', 'other', 'Faces', 'Ian', 'Maclagan', 'Kenny', 'Jones', 'as', 'well', 'important', 'notes', 'comments', 'Pete', 'Townshend', 'Eric', 'Clapton', 'Ronnie', 'brother', 'Stan', 'also', 'man', 'visual', 'biography', 'roots', 'Ronnie', 'upbringing', 'passion', 'music', 'eventually', 'led', 'formation', 'Small', 'Faces', 'Steve', 'Marriott', 'Faces', 'Rod', 'Ronnie', 'solo', 'career', 'Slim', 'Chance', 'focus', 'infliction', 'Multiple', 'Sclerosis', 'picture', 'sorrow', 'frustration', 'determination', 'optimism', 'rolled', 'fascinating', 'portrait', 'man', 'sometimes', 'stubborness', 'worked', 'process', 'are', 'snippets', 'tv', 'bootleg', 'video', 'archival', 'footage', 'Lane', 'Small', 'Faces', 'Faces', 'Slim', 'Chance', 'as', 'well', 'Rough', 'Mix', 'ARMS', 'solo', 'projects', 'continued', 'pursue', 'end', 'life', 'only', 'major', 'gripe', ""n't"", 'bonus', 'bits', '70', 'when', 'was', 'still', 'strong', 'enough', 'play', 'MS', 'afflicting', 'abilities', 'was', 'half', 'expecting', 'see', 'solo', 'perfomances', 'isolated', 'footage', 'available', 'YouTube', 'Slim', 'Chance', 'Faces', 'perhaps', 'will', 'be', 'unearthed', 'later', 'road', 'bonus', 'features', 'do', 'have', 'performances', 'people', 'who', 'knew', 'played', 'past', 'interpretations', 'songs', 'are', 'heartfelt', 'bittersweet', 'so', 'least', 'producers', 'were', 'able', 'offer', 'up', 'tandem', 'tribute', 'man', 'Fans', 'Faces/Small', 'Faces', 'disc', 'highly', 'recommended', 'fans', 'late', ""60's/early"", '70', 'British', 'Rock', 'whom', 'have', ""n't"", 'associated', 'Ronnie', 'Lane', 'Faces', 'disc', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'convert', 'being', 'loyal', 'fan', '4', 'solid', 'stars']",The Passing Show - The Life & Music of Ronnie Lane

In his heyday you had to dig a little to find his records, and now his heyday is about thirty years passed. He died in 1997 of MS. There was never much flash about the guy, but his music was excellent and unique. The niche he occupied was a very particular one and, sadly, no one before or since has come close to filling it. His personal misfortune notwithstanding, Ronnie Lane wrote largely acoustic, glad-to-be-alive songs in which accordians, tin whistles and the like featured. This DVD tells his story pretty well and serves to give the viewer a sense of the music he made, though, as one reviewer noted, there isn't the first complete performance to be had.
