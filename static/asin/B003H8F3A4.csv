1345721,A3IWM78R2BK9RU,B003H8F3A4,jj8429,"[2, 2]","I'm fussy about what I like in yoga.  In reading reviews, I realize everyone has their own style that they gravitate to.  I've tried countless yoga DVD's and pretty much kept going back to Bryan Kest Power Series and Janet Stone.  I've even tried a few of Rodney Yee's other videos but for whatever reason, didn't like them.  Well, NOT anymore!Yoga/stretching had been put on the back burner for us because we already work out daily for 30-90 minutes and adding a 50+ minute yoga routine to that was almost impossible.  Enter Rodney Yee's Ultimate Power Yoga..... As I said before, I've tried some of his other DVD's but didn't like the flow or whatever.  I decided to give this a try because of all the positive reviews, and much thanks to all reviewers!  (One of the reasons I shop Amazon and give my 2 cents when I can)!This dvd gets a solid five star rating from me.  The five routines are short (15-20 minutes each) which allows us to stretch almost every day, yet they can also be combined for a longer workout.  The holds are fairly long, and what I find exceptional is Rodney's cuing.  Even though it was my first time trying each routine, I didn't have to look at the TV to see what he was doing!!!!  That's huge for us.  We like to do yoga with no television picture, just ambient light for relaxation.BOTTOM LINE: This dvd is not a substitute for a full yoga practice. But it's absolutely perfect for the following:1) You don't have time for a full yoga practice, but want to maintain your flexibility. (Our situation at the present time).2) You're a beginner and want to work at flexibility and yoga moves.  Or you just want to work on your flexibility. Period.3) You already do a yoga practice and want to work on certain areas.  For instance, the ""Broadening Back Bends"" practice in the dvd is excellent if you have trouble with backbends.  I'm absolutely amazed how it loosens up my back in just 20 minutes!This is a wonderful dvd with relaxing, soothing music! The only CON for me is that I didn't discover it sooner!",5,Wish I Had Discovered This DVD Sooner,1331337600,"03 10, 2012",2012,2033,"[""'m"", 'fussy', 'what', 'like', 'yoga', 'reading', 'reviews', 'realize', 'everyone', 'own', 'style', 'gravitate', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'countless', 'yoga', 'DVD', 'pretty', 'much', 'kept', 'going', 'back', 'Bryan', 'Kest', 'Power', 'Series', 'Janet', 'Stone', ""'ve"", 'even', 'tried', 'few', 'Rodney', 'Yee', 'other', 'videos', 'reason', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'Well', 'NOT', 'anymore', 'Yoga/stretching', 'had', 'been', 'put', 'back', 'burner', 'already', 'work', 'out', 'daily', '30-90', 'minutes', 'adding', '50+', 'minute', 'yoga', 'routine', 'was', 'almost', 'impossible', 'Enter', 'Rodney', 'Yee', 'Ultimate', 'Power', 'Yoga', '..', 'said', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'other', 'DVD', 'did', ""n't"", 'flow', 'decided', 'give', 'try', 'positive', 'reviews', 'much', 'thanks', 'reviewers', 'One', 'reasons', 'shop', 'Amazon', 'give', '2', 'cents', 'when', 'can', 'dvd', 'solid', 'five', 'star', 'rating', 'five', 'routines', 'are', 'short', '15-20', 'minutes', 'stretch', 'almost', 'day', 'yet', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'combined', 'longer', 'workout', 'are', 'fairly', 'long', 'what', 'find', 'exceptional', 'Rodney', 'cuing', 'Even', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'trying', 'routine', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'look', 'TV', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'huge', 'like', 'do', 'yoga', 'television', 'picture', 'just', 'ambient', 'light', 'relaxation.BOTTOM', 'LINE', 'dvd', 'not', 'substitute', 'full', 'yoga', 'practice', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'following:1', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'full', 'yoga', 'practice', 'want', 'maintain', 'flexibility', 'situation', 'present', 'time', '.2', ""'re"", 'beginner', 'want', 'work', 'flexibility', 'yoga', 'moves', 'just', 'want', 'work', 'flexibility', 'Period.3', 'already', 'do', 'yoga', 'practice', 'want', 'work', 'certain', 'areas', 'instance', 'Broadening', 'Back', 'Bends', 'practice', 'dvd', 'excellent', 'have', 'trouble', 'backbends', ""'m"", 'absolutely', 'amazed', 'how', 'up', 'back', 'just', '20', 'minutes', 'wonderful', 'dvd', 'relaxing', 'soothing', 'music', 'only', 'CON', 'did', ""n't"", 'discover', 'sooner']",Ultimate Power Yoga

1345723,A26F5B12T242LL,B003H8F3A4,"Margaret P. ""mhp2027""","[5, 5]","""Ultimate Power Yoga"" has five 20-minute workouts. The difficulty is perfect for someone who findsA.M. Yoga for Your Weeka bit too easy. The target audience is people who have done Yoga long enough that they only need a brief warm-up, know the basic Hatha Yoga positions (e.g., downward facing dog) and don't need the instructor to talk them through 5-minutes of guided Corpse Pose at the end of a workout. This workout is not intended for beginners (i.e., people who have done little or no yoga before).The workouts on this DVD are each about 20-minutes long -- perfect for me to do at home in the morning, before going to work. The moves are not usually that difficult, but the pace, durration and combinations make these challenging workouts.  To increase the intensity, simply combine two or three into a 40 or 60 minute workout.  The workouts combine easily and gracefully into longer workouts. Now that I am used to them, the short warmups feel VERY appropriate to me, as do the short cool-downs.The body emphasis has changed from A.M. Yoga. Here, there are a lot more backbends and abdominal strengthening work. This is very welcome to me, as I believe A.M. Yoga (which I did about 5 times a week for 6 months) was a bit weak in those areas. The workout emphases are:- hip opening and abdominal strength (has the feeling of a warmup or easy workout for lazy days)- sun salutations (builds from easy to hard, learn how to do them right, backbend emphasis)- standing Yoga- backbends (front of thighs, hips, spine)- forward bends (surprisingly exhausting; then the second half has the feeling of a cooldown)The overall ""mood"" of this tape is that Rodney Yee took a 100 minute workout and divided it into 20 minute segments that could be done in isolation.  The 100 minute workout (all 5 sessions) is probably better theoretically, but I don't have that much time all at once or, let's face it, the strength or endurance.Highly recommended!",5,Excellent 20-min Yoga workouts,1294704000,"01 11, 2011",2011,1943,"['Ultimate', 'Power', 'Yoga', 'five', '20-minute', 'workouts', 'difficulty', 'perfect', 'someone', 'who', 'findsA.M', 'Yoga', 'Weeka', 'bit', 'too', 'easy', 'target', 'audience', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'done', 'Yoga', 'long', 'enough', 'only', 'need', 'brief', 'warm-up', 'know', 'basic', 'Hatha', 'Yoga', 'positions', 'e.g.', 'downward', 'facing', 'dog', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'instructor', 'talk', '5-minutes', 'guided', 'Corpse', 'Pose', 'end', 'workout', 'workout', 'not', 'intended', 'beginners', 'i.e.', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'done', 'little', 'yoga', 'before', '.The', 'workouts', 'DVD', 'are', '20-minutes', 'long', 'perfect', 'do', 'home', 'morning', 'going', 'work', 'moves', 'are', 'not', 'usually', 'difficult', 'pace', 'durration', 'combinations', 'make', 'challenging', 'workouts', 'increase', 'intensity', 'simply', 'combine', 'two', 'three', '40', '60', 'minute', 'workout', 'workouts', 'combine', 'easily', 'gracefully', 'longer', 'workouts', 'Now', 'am', 'used', 'short', 'warmups', 'feel', 'VERY', 'appropriate', 'do', 'short', 'cool-downs.The', 'body', 'emphasis', 'changed', 'A.M.', 'Yoga', 'Here', 'are', 'lot', 'more', 'backbends', 'abdominal', 'strengthening', 'work', 'very', 'welcome', 'believe', 'A.M.', 'Yoga', 'did', 'about', '5', 'times', 'week', '6', 'months', 'was', 'bit', 'weak', 'areas', 'workout', 'emphases', 'are', 'hip', 'opening', 'abdominal', 'strength', 'feeling', 'warmup', 'easy', 'workout', 'lazy', 'days', 'sun', 'salutations', 'builds', 'easy', 'hard', 'learn', 'how', 'do', 'right', 'backbend', 'emphasis', 'standing', 'Yoga-', 'backbends', 'front', 'thighs', 'hips', 'spine', 'forward', 'bends', 'surprisingly', 'exhausting', 'then', 'second', 'half', 'feeling', 'cooldown', 'overall', 'mood', 'tape', 'Rodney', 'Yee', 'took', '100', 'minute', 'workout', 'divided', '20', 'minute', 'segments', 'could', 'be', 'done', 'isolation', '100', 'minute', 'workout', '5', 'sessions', 'probably', 'better', 'theoretically', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'time', 'once', 'let', 'face', 'strength', 'endurance.Highly', 'recommended']",Ultimate Power Yoga

Some of the sessions will be difficult to do without a block.+ EXCELLENT SCRIPT: Yee's form is precise and instructions are explanatory enough to follow when you are unable to look at the screen, including form, positions and breath.+ ADJUSTABLE INSTRUCTION: Menus allow the user to select from five sessions in any combination. There is an option to adjust the audio (voice-over) to deliver abbreviated or detailed instructions.+ QUALITY PRODUCTION: The scenery, music and quality production complement the instruction.THE SO-SO (+/-)+/- NARRATED: Yee voices over the video, rather than giving instructions live.+/- WARM UP? Only one session, Power Foundation, comes close to being a warm-up.  It accelerates in pace to become a cardio workout.+/- LENGTH: A minimum of 35 minutes is required to complete a session when combined with a 20 minute warm-up.THE BAD (-)- TEMPO: Mostly, it's right but sometimes it seemed too quick. This is intended to deliver a cardio workout, but can be difficult to follow, manage or sustain, especially without a warm-up.- SPOTTY CHOREOGRAPHY: While the sessions progress in difficulty and then regress to a natural close in relaxation, they do not consistently flow in a way that gradually eases the muscles into the more challenging exercises. At times, it seems as though a few steps are missing that would better prepare the muscles.The choreography, at times, assumes all students are at the same level of ability as the instructor. The most advanced yoga positions sometimes lack alternative instructions, such as the use of props to aid in balance, strength and/or flexibility.- SAFETY CONCERNS: Several aspects of this practice are potentially unsafe, including the lack of an introduction suggesting a warm-up and the choreography that improperly prepares muscles for the challenges presented. This could lead to injury.- ANNOYING ADS: Gaiam ads are inconveniently placed in the beginning. Pressing the ""Menu"" button on your remote control will bring you immediately to a screen with an outline of all the sessions so you can select your preference without viewing or fast forwarding over any other content.THE BOTTOM LINEThis well produced yoga DVD could benefit from an introduction suggesting how to approach the practice for maximum benefit and safety.

I am a life coach, my job can drain me out fast but this workout really puts spring back in my step and relieves my job stress!:}",5,Rodney Yee's Vid is BUSTING MY A***,1316649600,"09 22, 2011",2011,507,"['BUY', 'AND', 'USE', 'THIS', 'DVD', 'did', 'yoga', '30', 'yrs', 'fell', 'away', 'normally', 'detest', 'work', 'out', 'vids', 'work', 'home', 'job', 'needed', 'SOMETHING', 'fill', 'what', 'treadmill', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'WOW', 'WOW', 'WOW', 'been', '2', 'weeks', 'vid', 'got', 'sore', 'muscles', 'never', 'knew', 'had', 'OH', 'MY', 'GODS', 'WAY', 'tougher', 'weights', 'loosening', 'back', 'energizing', 'am', 'life', 'coach', 'job', 'can', 'drain', 'fast', 'workout', 'really', 'spring', 'back', 'step', 'relieves', 'job', 'stress']",Ultimate Power Yoga

1345733,A26G8F446W714X,B003H8F3A4,Walrus,"[55, 59]","First off, let me say I am a fan of Rodney Yee, and have done his ""Power Yoga, Total Body"" workout everyday for almost three years. I was excited to hear of this release, but am a little disappointed. Many critics of PYTB stated the flow was too fast and the poses too difficult for beginners.  Apparently Yee listened to this feedback and developed ""Ultimate Power Yoga"" as a result.I was a beginner three years ago and yes, PYTB was a very challenging work out. I started out by modifying poses, using blocks and straps, and little by little perfected each pose.  I lost 50 pounds using that work out, had more energy, and never had to change my diet.  No I'm not trying to review PYTB, my point is coming.  ""Ultimate Power Yoga"" draws most of the poses of its predecessor, but spread over 5 workouts.  He slows things down tremendously, almost to the point that his verbal instructions are ahead of the next pose.So what am I basing my 4 star rating on?  My expectations were high on this release.  I wanted, like PYTB, a workout that was concise, a rigorous flow that worked the entire body, and a continuous flow that did not lag or stagnate.  When I read the description, it sounded like you could combine workouts without delay or having to use your remote, that you could program the workouts ahead of time.  This is not the case.Beginners, and people who have a lot of time to do yoga, will like this release, but to get the ""total body"" effect, plan on doing 95 minutes.  To me, it has too many warm up poses at the beginning of each of the 5 workouts and this makes me cool down when combining them.  To its credit, I have incorporated many new poses into the PYTB workout and have developed a customized workout using both.  I am also going to add an evening workout using the first workout entitled ""Power Foundations"", a twenty minute set of floor poses that give you a good stretch.This DVD consists of 5 workouts which include:1. Power Foundation (20 minutes) This routine will awaken your spirit and increase core stability for improved balance and stamina.2. Strengthening Sun Salutations (20 minutes) Flowing sequence of Sun Salutations will help build strength and flexibility. (Alternate Audio Tracks)3. Sculpting Standing Poses (15 minutes) Standing leg focused yoga poses will build power and alignment, (Alternate Audio Tracks)4. Broadening Back Bends (20 minutes) Strengthen and restore the spine to its natural alignment as you improve range of motion and stamina. (Alternate Audio Tracks)5. Ultimate Power Restoration (20 minutes) Relax and release built-up tension with a series of forward bends and slow, elongated stretches.Am I being too tough on this release?  Possibly.  I struggled with whether to give it 4 or 5 stars.  Newcomers to Yoga will probably really like this.  Yee obviously listened to his critics by slowing things down and making poses easier to perfect.  For me, the challenge is not as great as PYTB, stopping to get to the next workout disrupts the flow, and the flow seems choppy in general during each of the workouts. PYTB now seems like the Readers Digest version of this release.  As mentioned before I did get new ideas on how to modify and mix things up a bit to customize my present workout.  Had I not discovered PYTB, I would be content with this release and probably be very happy.  If you are like me, and have time constraints in the morning and want a concise, rigorous flow with poses that work the entire body, go with ""Power Yoga, Total Body"", and use poses from this DVD to get more variety.I do not want to discourage anyone from getting this DVD.  Yee's DVDs are the best workouts out there, imho.  The important thing is to do yoga.  I'm 52 years old and the benefits of yoga, for me, are too numerous to list. Yoga was my answer to my mid life crisis. Definitely cheaper than buying a red Porsche.This DVD does deserve a place on your exercise/fitness shelf.",4,"Highly recommended, but with a caveat...",1296864000,"02 5, 2011",2011,3931,"['First', 'off', 'let', 'say', 'am', 'fan', 'Rodney', 'Yee', 'have', 'done', 'Power', 'Yoga', 'Total', 'Body', 'workout', 'everyday', 'almost', 'three', 'years', 'was', 'excited', 'hear', 'release', 'am', 'little', 'disappointed', 'Many', 'critics', 'PYTB', 'stated', 'flow', 'was', 'too', 'fast', 'poses', 'too', 'difficult', 'beginners', 'Apparently', 'Yee', 'listened', 'feedback', 'developed', 'Ultimate', 'Power', 'Yoga', 'result.I', 'was', 'beginner', 'three', 'years', 'ago', 'yes', 'PYTB', 'was', 'very', 'challenging', 'work', 'started', 'out', 'modifying', 'poses', 'using', 'blocks', 'straps', 'little', 'little', 'perfected', 'pose', 'lost', '50', 'pounds', 'using', 'work', 'out', 'had', 'more', 'energy', 'never', 'had', 'change', 'diet', 'No', ""'m"", 'not', 'trying', 'review', 'PYTB', 'point', 'coming', 'Ultimate', 'Power', 'Yoga', 'most', 'poses', 'predecessor', 'spread', '5', 'workouts', 'things', 'down', 'tremendously', 'almost', 'point', 'verbal', 'instructions', 'are', 'ahead', 'next', 'pose.So', 'what', 'am', 'basing', '4', 'star', 'rating', 'expectations', 'were', 'high', 'release', 'wanted', 'PYTB', 'workout', 'was', 'concise', 'rigorous', 'flow', 'worked', 'entire', 'body', 'continuous', 'flow', 'did', 'not', 'lag', 'stagnate', 'When', 'read', 'description', 'sounded', 'could', 'combine', 'workouts', 'delay', 'having', 'use', 'remote', 'could', 'program', 'workouts', 'ahead', 'time', 'not', 'case.Beginners', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'lot', 'time', 'do', 'yoga', 'will', 'like', 'release', 'get', 'total', 'body', 'effect', 'plan', 'doing', '95', 'minutes', 'too', 'many', 'warm', 'up', 'poses', 'beginning', '5', 'workouts', 'cool', 'down', 'when', 'combining', 'credit', 'have', 'incorporated', 'many', 'new', 'poses', 'PYTB', 'workout', 'have', 'developed', 'customized', 'workout', 'using', 'am', 'also', 'going', 'add', 'evening', 'workout', 'using', 'first', 'workout', 'entitled', 'Power', 'Foundations', 'twenty', 'minute', 'set', 'floor', 'poses', 'give', 'good', 'stretch.This', 'DVD', '5', 'workouts', 'include:1', 'Power', 'Foundation', '20', 'minutes', 'routine', 'will', 'awaken', 'spirit', 'increase', 'core', 'stability', 'improved', 'balance', 'stamina.2', 'Strengthening', 'Sun', 'Salutations', '20', 'minutes', 'Flowing', 'sequence', 'Sun', 'Salutations', 'will', 'help', 'build', 'strength', 'flexibility', 'Alternate', 'Audio', 'Tracks', '3', 'Sculpting', 'Standing', 'Poses', '15', 'minutes', 'Standing', 'leg', 'focused', 'yoga', 'poses', 'will', 'build', 'power', 'alignment', 'Alternate', 'Audio', 'Tracks', '4', 'Broadening', 'Back', 'Bends', '20', 'minutes', 'Strengthen', 'restore', 'spine', 'natural', 'alignment', 'improve', 'range', 'motion', 'stamina', 'Alternate', 'Audio', 'Tracks', '5', 'Ultimate', 'Power', 'Restoration', '20', 'minutes', 'Relax', 'release', 'built-up', 'tension', 'series', 'forward', 'bends', 'slow', 'elongated', 'stretches.Am', 'being', 'too', 'tough', 'release', 'Possibly', 'struggled', 'give', '4', '5', 'stars', 'Newcomers', 'Yoga', 'will', 'probably', 'really', 'Yee', 'obviously', 'listened', 'critics', 'slowing', 'things', 'down', 'making', 'poses', 'easier', 'perfect', 'challenge', 'not', 'as', 'great', 'PYTB', 'stopping', 'get', 'next', 'workout', 'flow', 'flow', 'choppy', 'general', 'workouts', 'PYTB', 'now', 'Readers', 'Digest', 'version', 'release', 'mentioned', 'did', 'get', 'new', 'ideas', 'how', 'modify', 'mix', 'things', 'up', 'bit', 'customize', 'present', 'workout', 'Had', 'not', 'discovered', 'PYTB', 'would', 'be', 'content', 'release', 'probably', 'be', 'very', 'happy', 'are', 'have', 'time', 'constraints', 'morning', 'want', 'concise', 'rigorous', 'flow', 'poses', 'work', 'entire', 'body', 'go', 'Power', 'Yoga', 'Total', 'Body', 'use', 'poses', 'DVD', 'get', 'more', 'variety.I', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'discourage', 'anyone', 'getting', 'DVD', 'Yee', 'DVDs', 'are', 'best', 'workouts', 'out', 'there', 'imho', 'important', 'thing', 'do', 'yoga', ""'m"", '52', 'years', 'old', 'benefits', 'yoga', 'are', 'too', 'numerous', 'list', 'Yoga', 'was', 'answer', 'mid', 'life', 'crisis', 'Definitely', 'cheaper', 'buying', 'red', 'Porsche.This', 'DVD', 'deserve', 'place', 'exercise/fitness', 'shelf']",Ultimate Power Yoga
1345734,A2L6EV0V3SOATU,B003H8F3A4,Yoni,"[7, 7]","I really liked A.M yoga for your week so I wanted to get this one since it also have 5 practices each focusing on a different type of poses. According the advertisement I thought there would be a matrix so you can play each segment in each order you want but there is no such option, you have to pick a workout you want from the menu. The first segment focuses on some core strength and some stretches but I found it to be good for a gentle warmup or even better - a cooldown, it's not much of a workout. another weird thing, there's credits after that first segment which made me think it was meant to be a closing sequence originally but maybe it's just poor editing. The 20 minute sun salutation is the only segment you could call power yoga since it is more fast paced than the others and does make you sweat. The rest of the practices are nice and slow paced and good when I actually don't feel like a power or vinyasa type yoga. In the standing poses segment there's warrior 3 and half moon, a nice addition to the very basic standing segment on the A.M dvd. I also liked the backbends segment which is probably the most advanced, some nice preparations and I liked that he added side bow which you don't often see in DVD's as well as camel, bow and 2 rounds of wheel.The last restoration segment is made of long forward bends, first standing and then sitting. The disappointments - no matrix, no twisting postures, no inversions and no shavasana in all of the segments!!! but I still like it as a slower practice.",4,"nice but definitely not ""Power Yoga"", no option to customize",1288310400,"10 29, 2010",2010,1520,"['really', 'liked', 'A.M', 'yoga', 'week', 'so', 'wanted', 'get', 'one', 'also', 'have', '5', 'practices', 'focusing', 'different', 'type', 'poses', 'According', 'advertisement', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'matrix', 'can', 'play', 'segment', 'order', 'want', 'such', 'option', 'have', 'pick', 'workout', 'want', 'menu', 'first', 'segment', 'core', 'strength', 'stretches', 'found', 'be', 'good', 'gentle', 'warmup', 'even', 'better', 'cooldown', 'not', 'much', 'workout', 'weird', 'thing', 'credits', 'first', 'segment', 'made', 'think', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'closing', 'sequence', 'originally', 'just', 'poor', 'editing', '20', 'minute', 'sun', 'salutation', 'only', 'segment', 'could', 'call', 'power', 'yoga', 'more', 'fast', 'paced', 'others', 'make', 'sweat', 'rest', 'practices', 'are', 'nice', 'slow', 'paced', 'good', 'when', 'actually', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'power', 'vinyasa', 'type', 'yoga', 'standing', 'segment', 'warrior', '3', 'half', 'moon', 'nice', 'addition', 'very', 'basic', 'standing', 'segment', 'A.M', 'dvd', 'also', 'liked', 'backbends', 'segment', 'probably', 'most', 'advanced', 'nice', 'preparations', 'liked', 'added', 'side', 'bow', 'do', ""n't"", 'often', 'see', 'DVD', 'as', 'well', 'camel', 'bow', '2', 'rounds', 'wheel.The', 'last', 'restoration', 'segment', 'made', 'long', 'forward', 'bends', 'first', 'standing', 'then', 'sitting', 'disappointments', 'matrix', 'twisting', 'postures', 'inversions', 'shavasana', 'segments', 'still', 'like', 'slower', 'practice']",Ultimate Power Yoga
