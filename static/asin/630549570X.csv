466864,A179GX8E3M4G52,630549570X,"Mr D. ""Artist/Designer/Kibitzer""","[28, 31]","Teach me Tonight is a murder mystery. Well, it's supposed to be, but you know how erotic mysteries go. It's more like who's going to get naked next, and to whom are they going to do it.So does Teach me Tonight follow that familiar, successful format. Pretty much - lots of skin and lots of simulated (I think it's simulated) coitus, moderately well done, but there really is a mystery involved in this movie - who the hell is Judy Thompson? Other than being the remarkably gorgeous, fleshy star of this movie, she is an enigma. She appeared in no movies, either before or after, and a search for the inscrutable shapely brunette, on the internet, provides no answers. I have some thoughts on that, which I'll discuss later, but in the meantime, we have a movie to review.Teach me Tonight is, as you have probably guessed, an erotic softcore movie. The plot is a average one, but we don't watch these movies for the plot, do we?The lovely and mysterious Judy Thompson plays Janie, a graduate biochemistry student, who couples in an opening sex scene with her live in lover, teaching assistant, Michael (Rob Moser) in a back room at the university. Later at their apartment, thinking Michael has been unfaithful they have a argument and Janie leaves. Meanwhile while Janie spends the night at her wacky friend Frankie's (Kim Yates) pad, returning the next day to her bloodstained apartment. It seems Michael has managed to get himself whacked.Police Det.O'Rourke suspects Janie killed him, while she thinks, Frankie (Kim Yates) did it, so in order to clear herself Janie begins a parallel investigation.As you might suspect, her investigation is sometimes undertaken, unburdened by garments and often finds her investigating, the physical attributes of various suspects, including her college professor, Sterling Manville, and his wife Ariana. The professor and his wife, acting concerned and feigning friendship, drug Jamie with a strong aphrodisiac and proceed to have a threesome. Afterward, in a drugged condition, Janie stumbles upon alarming indications that she may be in the home of the murderers.ConclusionAs softcore movies go, I considered this one slightly above average. The story was a little better than average. If you haven't guessed I liked Judy Thompson and enjoyed the quirky Frankie. The acting was decent as were the several sex scenes. The erotic highlight of the film was when Janie watching a hardcore movie, masturbated. It was intense.When judging a softcore movie, I grade on a curve. I rate these movies against other movies within the adult movie field. These films tend to have low budgets, less experienced actors, if actors at all and the screenplays tend to be unbelievable or hokey. The obvious intention of these movies, and I don't believe anyone would watch them for any other reason, is to provoke sexual stimulation. (The definition of pornography) With those things in mind, I found the Teach me Tonight to be slightly above average, so I rated it, 3 ? stars.Report CardStory - C+Acting - C+Directing - CCinematography - BCast - B (Judy Thompson - A)Eroticism factor - B-Entertainment factor - C+I'm still at a loss as to why Judy Thompson of the bodacious body, never appeared in anything before or after this flick. Maybe Judy Thompson was a pseudonym used by Jennifer Love Hewitt when she was just getting started. Alternatively, maybe she was a college girl working at the nearby Starbucks, who caught the director's eye, making one movie before returning to her studies. On the other hand, just maybe, the originally scheduled actress had a scheduling conflict, leaving the producer high and dry, forcing him to use his trophy wife as Janie. In any event, in my opinion, Judy Thompson was a visual treat worth checking out..",4,Kudos for the Mystery Gal,1145404800,"04 19, 2006",2006,3768,"['Teach', 'Tonight', 'murder', 'mystery', 'Well', 'supposed', 'be', 'know', 'how', 'erotic', 'mysteries', 'go', 'more', 'who', 'going', 'get', 'naked', 'next', 'whom', 'are', 'going', 'do', 'it.So', 'Teach', 'Tonight', 'follow', 'familiar', 'successful', 'format', 'Pretty', 'much', 'lots', 'skin', 'lots', 'simulated', 'think', 'simulated', 'coitus', 'moderately', 'well', 'done', 'there', 'really', 'mystery', 'involved', 'movie', 'who', 'hell', 'Judy', 'Thompson', 'Other', 'being', 'remarkably', 'gorgeous', 'fleshy', 'star', 'movie', 'enigma', 'appeared', 'movies', 'search', 'inscrutable', 'shapely', 'brunette', 'internet', 'answers', 'have', 'thoughts', ""'ll"", 'discuss', 'later', 'meantime', 'have', 'movie', 'review.Teach', 'Tonight', 'have', 'probably', 'guessed', 'erotic', 'softcore', 'movie', 'plot', 'average', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'movies', 'plot', 'do', 'lovely', 'mysterious', 'Judy', 'Thompson', 'Janie', 'graduate', 'biochemistry', 'student', 'who', 'opening', 'sex', 'scene', 'live', 'lover', 'teaching', 'assistant', 'Michael', 'Rob', 'Moser', 'back', 'room', 'university', 'Later', 'apartment', 'thinking', 'Michael', 'been', 'unfaithful', 'have', 'argument', 'Janie', 'Meanwhile', 'Janie', 'night', 'wacky', 'friend', 'Frankie', 'Kim', 'Yates', 'pad', 'returning', 'next', 'day', 'bloodstained', 'apartment', 'Michael', 'managed', 'get', 'whacked.Police', ""Det.O'Rourke"", 'Janie', 'killed', 'Frankie', 'Kim', 'Yates', 'did', 'so', 'order', 'clear', 'Janie', 'parallel', 'investigation.As', 'might', 'suspect', 'investigation', 'sometimes', 'undertaken', 'unburdened', 'garments', 'often', 'investigating', 'physical', 'attributes', 'various', 'suspects', 'including', 'college', 'professor', 'Sterling', 'Manville', 'wife', 'Ariana', 'professor', 'wife', 'acting', 'concerned', 'feigning', 'friendship', 'drug', 'Jamie', 'strong', 'aphrodisiac', 'proceed', 'have', 'threesome', 'Afterward', 'drugged', 'condition', 'Janie', 'alarming', 'indications', 'may', 'be', 'home', 'murderers.ConclusionAs', 'softcore', 'movies', 'go', 'considered', 'one', 'slightly', 'average', 'story', 'was', 'little', 'better', 'average', 'have', ""n't"", 'guessed', 'liked', 'Judy', 'Thompson', 'enjoyed', 'quirky', 'Frankie', 'acting', 'was', 'decent', 'were', 'several', 'sex', 'scenes', 'erotic', 'highlight', 'film', 'was', 'when', 'Janie', 'watching', 'hardcore', 'movie', 'masturbated', 'was', 'intense.When', 'judging', 'softcore', 'movie', 'grade', 'curve', 'rate', 'movies', 'other', 'movies', 'adult', 'movie', 'field', 'films', 'tend', 'have', 'low', 'budgets', 'less', 'experienced', 'actors', 'actors', 'screenplays', 'tend', 'be', 'unbelievable', 'hokey', 'obvious', 'intention', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'anyone', 'would', 'watch', 'other', 'reason', 'provoke', 'sexual', 'stimulation', 'definition', 'pornography', 'things', 'mind', 'found', 'Teach', 'Tonight', 'be', 'slightly', 'above', 'average', 'rated', '3', 'stars.Report', 'CardStory', 'C+Acting', 'C+Directing', 'CCinematography', 'BCast', 'B', 'Judy', 'Thompson', 'Eroticism', 'factor', 'B-Entertainment', 'factor', 'C+I', ""'m"", 'still', 'loss', 'why', 'Judy', 'Thompson', 'bodacious', 'body', 'never', 'appeared', 'anything', 'flick', 'Maybe', 'Judy', 'Thompson', 'was', 'pseudonym', 'used', 'Jennifer', 'Love', 'Hewitt', 'when', 'was', 'just', 'getting', 'started', 'Alternatively', 'maybe', 'was', 'college', 'girl', 'working', 'nearby', 'Starbucks', 'who', 'caught', 'director', 'eye', 'making', 'one', 'movie', 'returning', 'studies', 'other', 'hand', 'just', 'maybe', 'originally', 'scheduled', 'actress', 'had', 'scheduling', 'conflict', 'leaving', 'producer', 'high', 'dry', 'forcing', 'use', 'trophy', 'wife', 'Janie', 'event', 'opinion', 'Judy', 'Thompson', 'was', 'visual', 'treat', 'checking', 'out..']",Teach Me Tonight
