The Kevin Spacey character is a retread of his character from ""Swimming with Sharks"", a far better dark comedy with a similar plot-line, and comes closest to being successful. The Colin Ferrel character is relatable, but they really missed the potential for some great, crass humor, going instead for a few fat jokes and the like. The Jennifer Anniston character is an absolute cop-out, though. There is great potential in exploring the tough female boss, who overcompensates for her perceived shortcomings or for inherent sexism by being TOO aggressive (I've worked for a PRIME example), but instead they go for the fantasy character of the sexy nympho boss.

It's boorish and absolutely hilarious. Everyone seems to have having a good time, especially the horrible bosses played by Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Aniston and Colin Farrell. Colin Farrell seems to be channeling Tom Cruise's performance from Tropic Thunder. He's completely unrecognizable as the kung fu obsessed tool of a boss, Bobby Pellit. Of course, no one does smarm better than Kevin Spacey. He's played this type of role before but never with so much glee. As for Jennifer Aniston, she is fabulous as the nymphomaniac dentist who lusts after her hygienist.The premise is very simple. Three under paid, under appreciated and over worked employees played by Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikis and Charlie Day decide that if they want their lives to improve, they need to murder their bosses. Thus begins the clever and very rude homage to Alfred Hitchcock's Strangers on a Train as well as Throw Mama From the Train.It's an intelligent, witty and extremely well written movie.

As the New Yorker said (roughly), it's sounds good when described, but it does not work well, a lot of funny ideas wasted. Kevin Spacey steals every scene he is in, but he's just being the same mean guy he often is. I've now come to realize why Jason Bateman did not make it after Teen Wolf 2: he only has one character in him and he does it in every movie. Poor guy has not made a great movie yet. He works as the central character in Arrested Development because of the enormous talent surrounding him and the great writing. The guy from IASIP is just annoying. Anniston's character does not exist in real life, she is purely wish fulfillment. The three central men are portrayed as smart guys and then we are supposed to believe that all three of them will mess up their caper at every chance. They do nothing right, very predictably. Colin Farrell is fun, but only because it's him, like Tom Cruise in Tropic Thunder. Steve Buscemi would have been better in both roles, but we would have just believed him and not thought it funny to have a Hollywood heart-throb play a douchebag. Is it funny to see a ""stud"" play a prick with a comb-over? Maybe for the first five seconds. The best moments are played by Jamie Foxx, as well as the way too short appearance by the guy from the Fantastic Four.

Second, I had scanned the reviews for this one before renting it and decided that since there seemed to be a 'half n' half' on it - some loved it and some were disappointed - it was probably worth a look.  I'm so glad I did, as it was one of the funniest 93 minutes I've enjoyed in a long time!The 3 main characters really aren't the bosses, but their employees.  Each with their own set of quirks, these three friends have growing up together and remaining friends, and hating their bosses in common.  What struck me about a third of the way in was how much it reminded me of the movie '9 to 5' - the theme of wanting to kill the boss and the comradare between the main characters.All the characters were played perfectly.  All of them are really one-dimensional, but they don't need to be more.  It all works and you get some surprising big name stars you've not seen in awhile popping into the movie too.Situational comedy is at the core of this film.  It's not slap-stick, but the dialogue between the characters is sharp and on-point.  If you are laughing too hard, the beauty of a rental is you can rewind to catch what you just missed!  I did it several times while watching this movie.You get a happy ending with lots of laughs from start to finish. The characters are fun, you empathize with the employees, feel the 'ugh' from the bosses, and laugh at the ineptness of regular guys who could be you, or your friends.Horrible Bosses is for anyone who enjoys comedic bi-play without a concern for the movie 'should' or 'could' be.

Though I found The Good Girl depressing and wouldn't watch it a second time, her acting was good. But why is it that lately anything labeled as a romantic comedy is just crude and trashy?

The storyline is simple- 3 employees who strongly dislike their ignorant and compassionless bosses come up with a plan to eventually murder them in the middle of the night.  It turns out this is one of the craziest nights you can imagine, haha.The film features plenty of top notch actors and actresses, the most surprising one has to be Jennifer Aniston playing the role of an exceptionally sexually active dentist who loves to say the worst things you can imagine while hitting on her assistant (a young man who refuses to go along with her obnoxious and flirtatious requests).  Now THIS is interesting- the woman is the one who's sexually harassing the man!  The tables have turned in this instance, so obviously I strongly recommend all children completely avoid this movie as a result of Jennifer Aniston's character.Another high point is Jason Bateman who, as always, plays the role of a guy trying to do the right thing and finding himself involved in the most unusual and regrettable of circumstances.  He needs to stop hanging out with losers and misfits!  Colin Farrell is sort of hilarious as well (believe it or not).  He plays a wimp that never says the right thing, like ever.  He inadvertently starts trouble as a result.This is a trashy comedy, plain and simple.  It does however benefit from maintaining a somewhat coherent plot, and the jokes are numerous and hardly let up. When the actual murder attempts get underway, there are a few occasions when the storytelling is sacrified for an excessive use of pointless gibberish between the main characters, which is why my rating can't possibly be a 5 out of 5.Overall, it's crude, it's trashy, it's todays comedy that sells really.",4,I unfortunately liked it...,1342915200,"07 22, 2012",2012,1805,"['Horrible', 'Bosses', 'one', 'so', 'crude', 'pointless', 'drivel', 'like', 'type', 'comedies', 'storyline', 'simple-', '3', 'employees', 'who', 'strongly', 'dislike', 'ignorant', 'compassionless', 'bosses', 'come', 'up', 'plan', 'eventually', 'murder', 'middle', 'night', 'out', 'one', 'craziest', 'nights', 'can', 'imagine', 'haha.The', 'film', 'features', 'plenty', 'top', 'notch', 'actors', 'actresses', 'most', 'surprising', 'one', 'be', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'playing', 'role', 'exceptionally', 'sexually', 'active', 'dentist', 'who', 'say', 'worst', 'things', 'can', 'imagine', 'hitting', 'assistant', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'go', 'along', 'obnoxious', 'flirtatious', 'requests', 'Now', 'THIS', 'interesting-', 'woman', 'one', 'who', 'sexually', 'harassing', 'man', 'tables', 'have', 'turned', 'instance', 'so', 'obviously', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'children', 'completely', 'avoid', 'movie', 'result', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'character.Another', 'high', 'point', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'who', 'always', 'role', 'guy', 'trying', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'finding', 'involved', 'most', 'unusual', 'regrettable', 'circumstances', 'stop', 'hanging', 'out', 'losers', 'misfits', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'sort', 'hilarious', 'well', 'believe', 'not', 'wimp', 'never', 'right', 'thing', 'ever', 'inadvertently', 'trouble', 'result.This', 'trashy', 'comedy', 'plain', 'simple', 'however', 'benefit', 'maintaining', 'somewhat', 'coherent', 'plot', 'jokes', 'are', 'numerous', 'hardly', 'let', 'up', 'When', 'actual', 'murder', 'attempts', 'get', 'underway', 'are', 'few', 'occasions', 'when', 'storytelling', 'sacrified', 'excessive', 'use', 'pointless', 'gibberish', 'main', 'characters', 'why', 'rating', 'ca', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'be', '5', '5.Overall', 'crude', 'trashy', 'todays', 'comedy', 'really']",N/A

Most suggestions to me compared it to &#34;Hangover,' which is why I put if off so long. But that's not a fair comparison at all. &#34;HB&#34; is a well made movie, Excellently directed, with great actors delivering quick, clever, witty and insightful dialogue that crackles from the start. There's nothing gratuitous about anything in this movie. The characters and scenes are all well written, and all vital to the story. There's nothing ad hoc added for gratuitous chuckles. Everything's there with a purpose, and wouldn't be the same without it. Every character is perfectly cast, with great lines across the board from each of them, often after the fact comments in a conversation, as done so excellently by Charlie Day. I couldn't name one of the lead actors including Jason Bateman and and Jason Sudeikis before this, but they were all perfectly cast, as were supporting actors Donald Sutherland, Jamie Foxx, Colin Farrell, Kevin Spacey and Jennifer Aniston. All playing off each other well. Every scene is well set, all the situations crackling with good writing and great characters. Constantly toying with you about the possibilities, and teasing you to the very end. No gratuitous fluff or vulgarity that's not fitting in the premise, and that separates it from comparisons to movies like Hangover or Bridesmaids (I think Melissa McCarthy's character was a force fed female Chris Farley type character that does nothing for the movie aside from trying to match the Hangover in character breadth. As if that's something to shoot for.) What's there in this movie is vital, and done with brilliant comedic delivery. This movie holds up to any comedy I've seen in a dozen years.

1403788,A3QNQQKJTL76H0,B004EPZ084,buru buru piggu,"[4, 5]","This movie falls into the genre of over-the-top R-rated drunk/stoner/slacker buddy movies likeHarold & Kumar,The Hangover, andHot Tub Time Machine. If you enjoy this kind of humor, you'll enjoy Horrible Bosses. The premise that these three seemingly-ordinary guys are fed up enough with their bosses to hatch a plan to murder them is ridiculous, but if you'll suspend your disbelief for the film, you'll have a good time. Mild-mannered, straight-laced social climber Nick (Jason Bateman) works for a world-class corporate a-hole (Kevin Spacey), getting to work at 6am each morning only to be berated for being 2 minutes late. Meanwhile recently-engaged and convicted sex-offender Dale is constantly sexually harassed by his nymphomaniac dentist boss and Kurt endures the crazed ravings of a cocaine-addicted sleazebag (Colin Farrell) who inherited the company reins. Why don't they just quit? It's the terrible job market, don't-cha know? The movie uses the rationale of a bad economy, so they can't just quit. They'd have to kill their bosses.The humor is decidedly raunchy and low-brow, so don't expect the Mrs. to join you on the couch. There's a lot of explicit sexual humor in here and references to sexual acts, though oddly, the movie is completely devoid of any nudity. We see Jennifer Aniston in lingerie under a lab coat and then later pleasuring herself in a hot tub, but that's about it. Early in the movie, she sprays Dale's crotch with water and says some funny and nasty things. It's fun to see her in such a different role, saying and doing so many dirty things. This alone might be worth the price of admission for many guys.If it weren't for Kevin Spacey and Jason Bateman, I probably would not have enjoyed this movie as much. They really make this work. Jamie Foxx also has a smaller, but funny role. I also got a kick out of seeing cameos by Donald Sutherland and Ioan Gruffudd (in a humorous exchange as the ""wet works man"").

The first 15-20 minutes of the movie is best, introducing the bosses, after that, it's just a wild goose chase of non sense.

1403796,AN9J46667D80O,B004EPZ084,"Chris Swanson ""I'm just this guy, you know?""","[20, 25]","I recall reading something a year or two ago about employee dissatisfaction. It commented that it tended to increase during times of economic trouble because employees who felt unhappy in the workplace didn't have the ability to escape. They were stuck with their current jobs, since leaving might mean they couldn't find another one. They also seldom got sympathy from other people who said, ""Hey, at least you have a job!"" This reached its culmination for me when the place where I worked put up a motivational poster that said, I kid you not, ""I should be grateful I have a job."" Indeed.In this time of economic troubles, it's perhaps surprising that a movie like this, where three friends get together to kill each other's horrible bosses, hasn't come along already. Well, it sort of did in 1980 with 9 to 5, but that was a bit different. I don't think I recall Franklin Hart, Jr, shooting anyone.The movie's title bosses are a corporate president (Kevin Spacey), a cokehead who inherited his father's chemical company (Colin Farrell), and, in one of the funnier performances, a dentist who doubles as a sexual predator (Jennifer Aniston). Their oppressed employees are, respectively, a man who is working hard for a position the corporate president takes for himself (Jason Bateman), a hard-working employee who loved the cokehead's father (Jason Sudekis), and a dental hygienist/sex offender who is recently engaged (It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia's Charlie Day). One night while mutually commiserating with each other in a bar a plan begins to take shape. What if they killed their bosses? Soon they have a ""murder consultant"" in the form of one MF Jones (Jamie Foxx), and, with vague memories that confuse Strangers on a Train with Throw Mama from the Train, the make ready to make murder.I had no great expectations going into this film, but I was surprised at how enjoyable it was and how much I liked it (also surprising? The ten-year-old boy sitting next me. Some parents...). The film is as raunchy as you'd expect any adult-oriented comedy to be, but it uses its raunch to great effect. There's the expected jokes centering around sex and bodily functions, but nothing too extreme.I was also surprised at how intelligent the movie is. At the start I was coming up with objections to the notion that the characters needed to kill their bosses instead of just get new ones, only to find the screenplay explaining why they couldn't just up and quit. I was also greatly amused when the friends ran into a former pal of theirs who'd lost his last job with Lehman Brothers and since had been forced to resort to offering a ""hearty handshake"", as it were, to men in bars.The performances were excellent all around. Spacey in particular seemed to be having a great time playing a deliciously evil man, while Aniston was clearly happy to ditch her good girl image. Day, who is a relative newcomer to film, plays a character not dissimilar to that of Charlie Kelly, proves that he can certainly hold his own on the screen with the big boys (and girl).The movie is ably directed by Seth Gordon, who keeps the action moving at a decent, but not frenetic, pace. He also knows when to throw in a good Tarantino homage. It's produced by the somewhat infamous Brett Ratner who proves that as a director, he makes for an acceptable producer.This isn't the best comedy ever, but it was a good time at the movies, and after a summer that's included films like the rather dull Green Lantern and the aggressively boring Transformers: Bark at the Moon, I'll take what I can get.",4,"Ah, the working world.",1310169600,"07 9, 2011",2011,3573,"['recall', 'reading', 'something', 'year', 'two', 'employee', 'dissatisfaction', 'commented', 'tended', 'increase', 'times', 'economic', 'trouble', 'employees', 'who', 'felt', 'unhappy', 'workplace', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'ability', 'escape', 'were', 'stuck', 'current', 'jobs', 'leaving', 'might', 'mean', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'one', 'also', 'seldom', 'got', 'sympathy', 'other', 'people', 'who', 'said', 'Hey', 'least', 'have', 'job', 'reached', 'culmination', 'when', 'place', 'where', 'worked', 'put', 'up', 'motivational', 'poster', 'said', 'kid', 'not', 'should', 'be', 'grateful', 'have', 'job', 'time', 'economic', 'troubles', 'perhaps', 'surprising', 'movie', 'where', 'three', 'friends', 'get', 'together', 'kill', 'other', 'horrible', 'bosses', ""n't"", 'come', 'already', 'Well', 'sort', 'did', '1980', '9', '5', 'was', 'bit', 'different', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'recall', 'Franklin', 'Hart', 'Jr', 'shooting', 'anyone.The', 'movie', 'title', 'bosses', 'are', 'corporate', 'president', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'cokehead', 'who', 'inherited', 'father', 'chemical', 'company', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'one', 'funnier', 'performances', 'dentist', 'who', 'sexual', 'predator', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'oppressed', 'employees', 'are', 'respectively', 'man', 'who', 'working', 'hard', 'position', 'corporate', 'president', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'hard-working', 'employee', 'who', 'loved', 'cokehead', 'father', 'Jason', 'Sudekis', 'dental', 'hygienist/sex', 'offender', 'who', 'recently', 'engaged', 'Always', 'Sunny', 'Philadelphia', 'Charlie', 'Day', 'One', 'night', 'mutually', 'commiserating', 'other', 'bar', 'plan', 'take', 'shape', 'What', 'killed', 'bosses', 'Soon', 'have', 'murder', 'consultant', 'form', 'one', 'MF', 'Jones', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'vague', 'memories', 'confuse', 'Strangers', 'Train', 'Throw', 'Mama', 'Train', 'make', 'ready', 'make', 'murder.I', 'had', 'great', 'expectations', 'going', 'film', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'enjoyable', 'was', 'how', 'much', 'liked', 'also', 'surprising', 'ten-year-old', 'boy', 'sitting', 'next', 'parents', 'film', 'as', 'raunchy', ""'d"", 'expect', 'adult-oriented', 'comedy', 'be', 'raunch', 'great', 'effect', 'expected', 'jokes', 'centering', 'sex', 'bodily', 'functions', 'nothing', 'too', 'extreme.I', 'was', 'also', 'surprised', 'how', 'intelligent', 'movie', 'start', 'was', 'coming', 'up', 'objections', 'notion', 'characters', 'needed', 'kill', 'bosses', 'instead', 'just', 'get', 'new', 'ones', 'only', 'find', 'screenplay', 'explaining', 'why', 'could', ""n't"", 'just', 'up', 'quit', 'was', 'also', 'greatly', 'amused', 'when', 'friends', 'ran', 'former', 'pal', 'theirs', 'who', ""'d"", 'lost', 'last', 'job', 'Lehman', 'Brothers', 'had', 'been', 'forced', 'resort', 'offering', 'hearty', 'handshake', 'were', 'men', 'bars.The', 'performances', 'were', 'excellent', 'around', 'Spacey', 'particular', 'seemed', 'be', 'having', 'great', 'time', 'playing', 'deliciously', 'evil', 'man', 'Aniston', 'was', 'clearly', 'happy', 'ditch', 'good', 'girl', 'image', 'Day', 'who', 'relative', 'newcomer', 'film', 'character', 'not', 'dissimilar', 'Charlie', 'Kelly', 'can', 'certainly', 'hold', 'own', 'screen', 'big', 'boys', 'girl', '.The', 'movie', 'ably', 'directed', 'Seth', 'Gordon', 'who', 'action', 'moving', 'decent', 'not', 'frenetic', 'pace', 'also', 'when', 'throw', 'good', 'Tarantino', 'homage', 'produced', 'somewhat', 'infamous', 'Brett', 'Ratner', 'who', 'director', 'acceptable', 'producer.This', ""n't"", 'best', 'comedy', 'ever', 'was', 'good', 'time', 'movies', 'summer', 'included', 'films', 'rather', 'dull', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'aggressively', 'boring', 'Transformers', 'Bark', 'Moon', ""'ll"", 'take', 'what', 'can', 'get']",N/A

1403809,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B004EPZ084,C. Sawin,"[69, 81]","There have been quite a few R-rated comedies this year, but they've all left something to be desired. Your Highness collapsed under being nothing but improvised toilet humor, The Hangover Part II was a complete rehash of the original, Hall Pass was just a disappointing attempt by the Farrelly brothers, and Bad Teacher was too tame to really be called ""bad"" at all. Paul and Bridesmaids were both pretty decent, but Paul wasn't nearly as good as the movies Simon Pegg and Nick Frost collaborated with Edgar Wright on and Bridesmaids pretty much played out like every other Judd Apatow movie out there. It was beginning to feel like every R-rated comedy from here on out would be so similar to everything before it that the laughs it tried to provide wouldn't be very funny at all. Thankfully, Horrible Bosses came along to prove that theory wrong.What's interesting is that Horrible Bosses kind of follows the same formula as The Hangover; three guys getting themselves into a really terrible situation but roofies are replaced with a crazy scheme to kill their bosses. The funniest aspect of the movie lies within three guys, Nick (Jason Bateman), Dale (Charlie Day), and Kurt (Jason Sudeikis), obviously having no idea what they're getting themselves into and dealing with the situation in the worst way imaginable. Things get really crazy really fast and only get more hectic as the movie jogs along. That's essentially the movie's charm. While the formulas to the two movies are similar, Horrible Bosses does seem to offer quite a bit more than The Hangover.The cast may be the strongest factor of the movie though as nearly everybody involved makes the most of their screen time and manages to get a laugh or two in no matter if they're a recognized name or a new face. Kevin Spacey, Colin Farrell, and Jennifer Aniston play the three bosses and they're all fantastic in their roles. Spacey just goes out of his way to be the most despicable person anyone could really come across while Farrell, despite being selfish and greedy, still manages to toss in a few pretty hysterical one-liners. Aniston will probably be the one that sticks out the most since she makes the biggest impact by being rather forward with her sexual desires for Dale. It's just such a different role from what Aniston has played in the past. The chemistry between Bateman, Day, and Sudeikis is really spot-on, as well. Their conversations, fighting amongst each other and interactions just make you really believe that these three have known each other for years. Even though his role is a little small, Jamie Foxx deserves a mention as well. Dean Jones turns out to just be a really entertaining character overall.It's difficult to point out any sort of problems this comedy really has, if there are any at all. The film is extremely vulgar, but doesn't really feel entirely too crude or include any gross out gags like many R-rated comedies seem to fall victim to. None of the cast drags the movie down as they all do their part to drive the movie forward. I feel like it won't be as successful as some would think though and will be overshadowed by other comedies that aren't nearly as solid or as funny as Horrible Bosses is. That's really the only complaint anyone could possibly have.Horrible Bosses is easily the most hilarious R-rated comedy of the summer. The strong cast, amusing dialogue, and entertaining banter between Nick, Dale, and Kurt is more than enough to sky rocket Horrible Bosses to the top of the list of comedies released this year. Charlie Day will have you laughing right from the start. Luckily, Horrible Bosses came along to inject some much needed hilarity into mainstream comedy this season.",4,A breath of fresh air to the R-rated comedy genre,1310169600,"07 9, 2011",2011,3702,"['have', 'been', 'quite', 'few', 'R-rated', 'comedies', 'year', ""'ve"", 'left', 'something', 'be', 'desired', 'Highness', 'collapsed', 'being', 'nothing', 'improvised', 'toilet', 'humor', 'Hangover', 'Part', 'II', 'was', 'complete', 'rehash', 'original', 'Hall', 'Pass', 'was', 'just', 'disappointing', 'attempt', 'Farrelly', 'brothers', 'Bad', 'Teacher', 'was', 'too', 'tame', 'really', 'be', 'called', 'bad', 'Paul', 'Bridesmaids', 'were', 'pretty', 'decent', 'Paul', 'was', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'movies', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'Nick', 'Frost', 'collaborated', 'Edgar', 'Wright', 'Bridesmaids', 'pretty', 'much', 'played', 'out', 'other', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'movie', 'there', 'was', 'beginning', 'feel', 'R-rated', 'comedy', 'here', 'out', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'similar', 'everything', 'laughs', 'tried', 'provide', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'very', 'funny', 'Thankfully', 'Horrible', 'Bosses', 'came', 'along', 'prove', 'theory', 'wrong.What', 'interesting', 'Horrible', 'Bosses', 'kind', 'same', 'formula', 'Hangover', 'three', 'guys', 'getting', 'really', 'terrible', 'situation', 'roofies', 'are', 'replaced', 'crazy', 'scheme', 'kill', 'bosses', 'funniest', 'aspect', 'movie', 'three', 'guys', 'Nick', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'Dale', 'Charlie', 'Day', 'Kurt', 'Jason', 'Sudeikis', 'obviously', 'having', 'idea', 'what', ""'re"", 'getting', 'dealing', 'situation', 'worst', 'way', 'imaginable', 'Things', 'get', 'really', 'crazy', 'really', 'fast', 'only', 'get', 'more', 'hectic', 'movie', 'jogs', 'along', 'essentially', 'movie', 'charm', 'formulas', 'two', 'movies', 'are', 'similar', 'Horrible', 'Bosses', 'seem', 'offer', 'quite', 'bit', 'more', 'Hangover.The', 'cast', 'may', 'be', 'strongest', 'factor', 'movie', 'nearly', 'everybody', 'involved', 'most', 'screen', 'time', 'manages', 'get', 'laugh', 'two', 'matter', ""'re"", 'recognized', 'name', 'new', 'face', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'play', 'three', 'bosses', ""'re"", 'fantastic', 'roles', 'Spacey', 'just', 'way', 'be', 'most', 'despicable', 'person', 'anyone', 'could', 'really', 'come', 'Farrell', 'being', 'selfish', 'greedy', 'still', 'toss', 'few', 'pretty', 'hysterical', 'one-liners', 'Aniston', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'one', 'out', 'most', 'biggest', 'impact', 'being', 'rather', 'forward', 'sexual', 'desires', 'Dale', 'just', 'such', 'different', 'role', 'what', 'Aniston', 'played', 'past', 'chemistry', 'Bateman', 'Day', 'Sudeikis', 'really', 'spot-on', 'as', 'well', 'conversations', 'fighting', 'amongst', 'other', 'interactions', 'just', 'make', 'really', 'believe', 'three', 'have', 'known', 'other', 'years', 'Even', 'role', 'little', 'small', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'mention', 'as', 'well', 'Dean', 'Jones', 'out', 'just', 'be', 'really', 'entertaining', 'character', 'overall.It', 'difficult', 'point', 'out', 'sort', 'problems', 'comedy', 'really', 'are', 'film', 'extremely', 'vulgar', ""n't"", 'really', 'feel', 'entirely', 'too', 'crude', 'include', 'gross', 'out', 'gags', 'many', 'R-rated', 'comedies', 'seem', 'fall', 'victim', 'None', 'cast', 'movie', 'down', 'do', 'part', 'drive', 'movie', 'forward', 'feel', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'as', 'successful', 'would', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'overshadowed', 'other', 'comedies', 'are', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'solid', 'as', 'funny', 'Horrible', 'Bosses', 'really', 'only', 'complaint', 'anyone', 'could', 'possibly', 'have.Horrible', 'Bosses', 'easily', 'most', 'hilarious', 'R-rated', 'comedy', 'summer', 'strong', 'cast', 'amusing', 'dialogue', 'entertaining', 'banter', 'Nick', 'Dale', 'Kurt', 'more', 'enough', 'sky', 'rocket', 'Horrible', 'Bosses', 'top', 'list', 'comedies', 'released', 'year', 'Charlie', 'Day', 'will', 'have', 'laughing', 'right', 'start', 'Luckily', 'Horrible', 'Bosses', 'came', 'along', 'inject', 'much', 'needed', 'hilarity', 'mainstream', 'comedy', 'season']",N/A

Spacey plays an immoral megalomaniac, Anniston a maneating predator, and Farrell a lowlife cokehead; all three are unabashedly over the top, and it pays comedic dividends in spades.  So when Nick (Jason Bateman), Kurt (Jason Sudeikis), and Dale (Charlie Day is hysterical) are collectively overwhelmed to the point of plotting to kill their bosses, they enlist the aid of a hoodlum (Jamie Foxx, yet another grand enhancement to the cast); and of course, everything goes to Hades in a handcart, making this madcap gem one whale of a fun ride.  Sure, there is locker room humor, and it's rude and crude, but it's done so masterfully it dares you not to belly laugh.Look for cameos by Ron White and Bob Newhart that deliver some grins, and the entire cast deserves kudos for comedic timing, pacing, chemistry, and delivery.

Luckily, I'm not capable of that level of sophisticated analysis, nor do I expect much out of a comedy released in July, so I found the movie very funny.Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikis and Charlie Day play three put-upon employees with evil bosses who regularly get together to commiserate.  At one point, someone suggests murder would be a good solution to their problems, and another suggests that if they murder each other's bosses, no one will be able to trace it.  Their bosses include a sexually predatory dentist  (Jennifer Aniston channeling Demi Moore in ""Disclosure""); a twerpy amoral cokehead (Colin Farrell with a bad comb-over) and a company president who plays head games (Kevin Spacey, much better in ""Swimming With Sharks"").  Because they don't have much experience with this sort of thing, they wind up hiring Jamie Foxx.  Because Foxx's character (whose name I can't give here) doesn't either, things start to go awry.Those who've seen the eighties' movie ""9 to 5"", starring Dolly Parton, Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin, will recognize the storyline.

It wasn't as funny as &#34;We're The Millers&#34; (One of the most surprisingly funny movies I've seen in years - didn't expect much), but it certainly had a lot of funny lines and scenes.First the Bosses: We've seen Kevin Spacey already as a horrible boss (Swimming With Sharks), so that character wasn't new, but still entertaining.  Colin Farrell was absolutely hysterical as a coked out, nasty, balding, POS with absolutely NO redeeming qualities.  Jennifer Aniston is starting to play outside her cookie cutter comedy roles (as she did in &#34;We're The Millers&#34;) and becoming a bit more convincing.  She still has a ways to go before she is able to completely shed the &#34;girl next door&#34; persona that you get the moment you look at her.  In this she plays a nymphomaniac dentist.The Employees:  Charlie Day's character (Dale Arbus) is a slightly annoying character and the most unrealistic character of them all (not like there weren't some others).  So, a red-blooded, heterosexual male is going to be &#34;annoyed&#34; and ward off the advances (with NO INDICATION of temptation mind you) of a sexed up Jennifer Aniston???  Jennifer Aniston never did it for me personally, and I'm a happily married guy who takes his vows seriously, but I would be hard pressed to resist this one.  Even if I could, it would be quite the internal moral battle!  Jason Bateman is always... well... Jason Bateman.  I never found him funny (and still don't in this movie) and that's probably because after playing the weak, emasculated, insecure, push-over again and again and again, you just want to see some, how should one say.... balls!  It seems he always plays this character.Then there's Jason Sudeikis.  This is the second movie I have ever seen him in (The first being &#34;We're The Millers&#34;), and I'm not sure if he just gets all the good lines, or he just turns all of his lines into comedy gold.  My guess would probably be a little of both.  He is the comedy gem in this movie and once again some of the lines that come out of his mouth (often quick asides) are just hysterical!I usually don't like talking about plots in reviews because you can get a storyline on any movie in 1000 different places.

The story is ludicrous - maybe playing out the fantasies most people control about disliking their 'bosses' is OK but actually showing it is another item altogether. Potty mouth dialogue, sociopathic behavior supposedly masked by three guys who 'really aren't all that bad', and placing the roles of Bosses who are over the top obnoxious and maladaptive in the hands of actors of the caliber of Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Anniston, and Colin Farrell is a gross waste of talent. Then padding the 'story' with appearances (albeit brief) by Donald Sutherland, Bob Newhart, Jamie Foxx and especially Ioan Gruffudd - there must be some favors owed somewhere.It is a committee written script (Michael Markowitz, John Francis Daley, Jonathan Goldstein) and it shows: this is more a disconnected series of standup comedian jokes than a story. Seth Gordon directs with a heavy hand on exasperatingly gross language and sexual innuendoes, insulting just about everybody possible. The only saving grace about this 'film' is the comedic timing by Jason Bateman and his cohorts in crime - Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis. There are some funny lines but the sorry mess you have to wade through to get to them is hardly worth the effort.

It didn't fit the recent run of similar movies where the crass humor is funny and silly in a harmless way.

Along the way, they come in contact a ""killer"" played by Jamie Foxx. His character's name is so wildly vulgar and in bad taste that the name cannot even be mentioned in the review. The name becomes an ongoing joke. Kevin Spacey is the boss from hell..much like his character in SWIMMING WITH SHARKS. Jason Bateman, Colin Farrell and Donald Sutherland are also great actors whose talents are wasted in the film. Farrell plays completely against his sexy image and is almost unrecognizeable as another horrible boss.Charlie Day is the dental assistant being sexually harassed by the overly sexual dentist played by Jennifer Aniston. I had never seen Charlie Day before and I enjoyed his character at first until he started sounding more and more like Bobcat Goldthwait in his mutterings. Another actor wasted in this film.In the beginning as we are introduced to characters, there is a freeze-frame and words describing the character appear on screen.

1403869,AIO247KHD2O40,B004EPZ084,James N Simpson,"[0, 0]","This is quite a fun movie to watch.  Three friends all with bosses who had made their lives miserable, and a belief they can't leave or they'll be unemployable, decide to do something about it.  Although two of them are at the top of their profession in the corporate word, in the real one all three lack street smarts, have avoided parts of their city due to fear so are culturally socially ignorant, all of which is what makes the trio work so well on the screen, as well as gives the plot a slight bit of plausibility. The movie certainly has a bit of The Hangover feel to it, although this one's plot is more predictable. The trio sort of give off a Lethal Weapon 2 comradely vibe as well when about a third of the way into the film the dental assistant character transforms from a more sensible guy (and believable for his stance on the situation with a sex addict boss) into a klutzy third wheel Leo (Joe Pesci) type character who like with the Weapon franchise also gets locked out the car at one stage by the other two as a punishment think about your actions lesson.  Not sure why the producers changed the dental assistant mid way through, his latter character fits more into the scenes for the rest of the movie but it is a noticeable change.The bosses who have less screen time are also well played by Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Anniston and Colin Farrell.  The two male actors instantly make you dislike their characters which is what is needed for the film to work.  Anniston does a great job at playing a predatory sex addict but it's more of a comical role than a believable character.  Also the situation is a bit unbelievable, the Joe Pesci version of Dale I didn't buy would have turned her down if nothing else simply as he is too wussy to stand up to her.  Other than for the fun of making him uncomfortable it would seem unlikely his character would be attractive to a confident successful woman.  They should have added something to make her unappealing even repulsive to Dale like a giant hairy mole or perhaps cast a less attractive actress all together.But none of these minor things, although lessening the plausibility, lessen the overall entertainment factor which for me makes Horrible Bosses a very enjoyable movie to watch.",5,"Entertains You for the Whole 90 Minutes, What More Could You Want",1399939200,"05 13, 2014",2014,2251,"['quite', 'fun', 'movie', 'watch', 'Three', 'friends', 'bosses', 'who', 'had', 'made', 'lives', 'miserable', 'belief', 'ca', ""n't"", 'leave', ""'ll"", 'be', 'unemployable', 'decide', 'do', 'something', 'two', 'are', 'top', 'profession', 'corporate', 'word', 'real', 'one', 'three', 'lack', 'street', 'smarts', 'have', 'avoided', 'parts', 'city', 'due', 'fear', 'so', 'are', 'culturally', 'socially', 'ignorant', 'what', 'trio', 'work', 'so', 'well', 'screen', 'as', 'well', 'plot', 'slight', 'bit', 'plausibility', 'movie', 'certainly', 'bit', 'Hangover', 'feel', 'one', 'plot', 'more', 'predictable', 'trio', 'sort', 'give', 'Lethal', 'Weapon', '2', 'comradely', 'vibe', 'as', 'well', 'when', 'third', 'way', 'film', 'dental', 'assistant', 'character', 'transforms', 'more', 'sensible', 'guy', 'believable', 'stance', 'situation', 'sex', 'addict', 'boss', 'klutzy', 'third', 'wheel', 'Leo', 'Joe', 'Pesci', 'type', 'character', 'who', 'Weapon', 'franchise', 'also', 'locked', 'out', 'car', 'one', 'stage', 'other', 'two', 'punishment', 'think', 'actions', 'lesson', 'Not', 'sure', 'why', 'producers', 'changed', 'dental', 'assistant', 'mid', 'way', 'latter', 'character', 'more', 'scenes', 'rest', 'movie', 'noticeable', 'change.The', 'bosses', 'who', 'have', 'less', 'screen', 'time', 'are', 'also', 'well', 'played', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Jennifer', 'Anniston', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'two', 'male', 'actors', 'instantly', 'make', 'dislike', 'characters', 'what', 'needed', 'film', 'work', 'Anniston', 'great', 'job', 'playing', 'predatory', 'sex', 'addict', 'more', 'comical', 'role', 'believable', 'character', 'Also', 'situation', 'bit', 'unbelievable', 'Joe', 'Pesci', 'version', 'Dale', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'would', 'have', 'turned', 'down', 'nothing', 'else', 'simply', 'too', 'wussy', 'stand', 'up', 'Other', 'fun', 'making', 'uncomfortable', 'would', 'seem', 'unlikely', 'character', 'would', 'be', 'attractive', 'confident', 'successful', 'woman', 'should', 'have', 'added', 'something', 'make', 'unappealing', 'even', 'repulsive', 'Dale', 'giant', 'hairy', 'mole', 'perhaps', 'cast', 'less', 'attractive', 'actress', 'together.But', 'none', 'minor', 'things', 'lessening', 'plausibility', 'overall', 'entertainment', 'factor', 'Horrible', 'Bosses', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'watch']",N/A

1403889,A3OP9CU8GUWI03,B004EPZ084,"J. Ridgway ""Ridge""","[4, 9]","My feeling after seeing this movie was that it is silly, adolescent, vulger & crude, but that it is pushed (just barely) up into the level of 3 stars by its all-star cast (Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Aniston, Colin Ferrell and Jason Bateman).  Of course, many people can relate to having bad bosses, and fleeting thoughts of knocking them off sometime.  So our modern three stooges (three 30-something middle-class guys) each have a bad boss: Spacey is the arrogant bastard boss, Ferrell is the selfish druggie boss, and Aniston is the overly sexual female boss.  Each is over-the-top unrealistic.  Actually the whole movie feels over-the-top (I guess that Hollywood thinks they have to do everything that way -- like hitting you in the face with a mallet.)  But Spacey does play a very effective flaming jerk, ultra-arrogant, rich guy, and Ferrell a flaming jerk, coke-head, and Aniston a flaming jerk nympho dentist.The guys decide to knock off each other's boss and things get out of control.  Really, the plot is just a vehicle to run a number of gags & jokes.  Like breaking into the druggy's house & spilling his cocaine all over the place & sweeping it up with a dust-buster.  Like hiring a ""hit man"" from ""men seeking men"" in the local paper and learning that he's got other things on his mind.  Like going to a black bar in a seedy part of town and hiring a scary-looking ex-con named ""M********r Jones"", and our silly, wimpy stooges calling him by his name all the time.  Like getting an Indian guy on the GPS help line in the car, named ""Gregory"" because his real name is unpronounceable (Gregory plays a big role at the end though).Everything is exceedingly stupid, but it hits the funnybone about half the time.  The three stooges have pretty good comedic chemistry.  Aniston does add a lot of stimulation by showing off her (pretty darn sexy)  body in different stages of undress in a psycho-nympho role .... that old adolescent Hollywood trick works all the time I guess.  Then there's the old ""who would get raped worse in jail?"" supposedly humorous discussion ... there's nothing better for yucking things up than prison rape jokes!  Then there's the old ""we are three white goofy buffoons talking to a cool black guy who calls us morons and rips us off"" situation.  i.e. self-abasement by the immature and non-streetwise white men is supposed to be hilarious (or maybe it's just a Hollywood requirement if there are blacks & whites together in a movie.)  But the abasement goes both ways, due to the first name of the black ex-con, which has to be the most despicable word in the English language.So there's a lot of low-class humor in this movie.  Actually, I get pretty tired of the F-word interjected into half of the lines in the movie by its end.  Don't the writers, who are supposedly the best in the country and very well paid, have any more literary talent than to say ""F-this, F-that, F-ing F"" all the time in order to get laughs?  Well, OK, that's what to expect from a modern R-rated comedy.",3,"Silly, crude comedy but it succeeds (barely) because of all-star cast",1310601600,"07 14, 2011",2011,3015,"['feeling', 'seeing', 'movie', 'was', 'silly', 'adolescent', 'vulger', 'crude', 'pushed', 'just', 'barely', 'up', 'level', '3', 'stars', 'all-star', 'cast', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'Colin', 'Ferrell', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'course', 'many', 'people', 'can', 'relate', 'having', 'bad', 'bosses', 'fleeting', 'thoughts', 'knocking', 'off', 'sometime', 'So', 'modern', 'three', 'stooges', 'three', '30-something', 'middle-class', 'guys', 'have', 'bad', 'boss', 'Spacey', 'arrogant', 'bastard', 'boss', 'Ferrell', 'selfish', 'druggie', 'boss', 'Aniston', 'overly', 'sexual', 'female', 'boss', 'over-the-top', 'unrealistic', 'Actually', 'whole', 'movie', 'feels', 'over-the-top', 'guess', 'Hollywood', 'have', 'do', 'everything', 'way', 'hitting', 'face', 'mallet', 'Spacey', 'play', 'very', 'effective', 'flaming', 'jerk', 'ultra-arrogant', 'rich', 'guy', 'Ferrell', 'flaming', 'jerk', 'coke-head', 'Aniston', 'flaming', 'jerk', 'dentist.The', 'guys', 'decide', 'knock', 'off', 'other', 'boss', 'things', 'get', 'control', 'Really', 'plot', 'just', 'vehicle', 'run', 'number', 'gags', 'jokes', 'breaking', 'druggy', 'house', 'spilling', 'cocaine', 'place', 'sweeping', 'up', 'dust-buster', 'hiring', 'hit', 'man', 'men', 'seeking', 'men', 'local', 'paper', 'learning', 'got', 'other', 'things', 'mind', 'going', 'black', 'bar', 'seedy', 'part', 'town', 'hiring', 'scary-looking', 'ex-con', 'named', 'M********r', 'Jones', 'silly', 'wimpy', 'stooges', 'calling', 'name', 'time', 'getting', 'Indian', 'guy', 'GPS', 'help', 'line', 'car', 'named', 'Gregory', 'real', 'name', 'unpronounceable', 'Gregory', 'big', 'role', 'end', '.Everything', 'exceedingly', 'stupid', 'funnybone', 'time', 'three', 'stooges', 'have', 'pretty', 'good', 'comedic', 'chemistry', 'Aniston', 'add', 'lot', 'stimulation', 'showing', 'off', 'pretty', 'darn', 'sexy', 'body', 'different', 'stages', 'undress', 'psycho-nympho', 'role', 'old', 'adolescent', 'Hollywood', 'trick', 'time', 'guess', 'Then', 'old', 'who', 'would', 'get', 'raped', 'worse', 'jail', 'supposedly', 'humorous', 'discussion', 'nothing', 'better', 'yucking', 'things', 'up', 'prison', 'rape', 'jokes', 'Then', 'old', 'are', 'three', 'white', 'goofy', 'buffoons', 'talking', 'cool', 'black', 'guy', 'who', 'morons', 'rips', 'off', 'situation', 'i.e', 'self-abasement', 'immature', 'non-streetwise', 'white', 'men', 'supposed', 'be', 'hilarious', 'maybe', 'just', 'Hollywood', 'requirement', 'are', 'blacks', 'whites', 'together', 'movie', 'abasement', 'ways', 'due', 'first', 'name', 'black', 'ex-con', 'be', 'most', 'despicable', 'word', 'English', 'language.So', 'lot', 'low-class', 'humor', 'movie', 'Actually', 'get', 'pretty', 'tired', 'F-word', 'interjected', 'half', 'lines', 'movie', 'end', 'Do', ""n't"", 'writers', 'who', 'are', 'supposedly', 'best', 'country', 'very', 'well', 'paid', 'have', 'more', 'literary', 'talent', 'say', 'F-this', 'F-that', 'F-ing', 'F', 'time', 'order', 'get', 'laughs', 'Well', 'OK', 'what', 'expect', 'modern', 'R-rated', 'comedy']",N/A

Power ""nlp trainer""","[3, 4]","If you're like most people at some point you have probably worked for a horrible boss, and so you can derive a vicarious thrill from this movie.If you have seen Hitchcock's classic Strangers on a Train, or Throw Momma from the Train starring Danny De Vito the premise will be familiar.  Subtract a train, substitute 3 authority figures for a parental figure, add a healthy dose of  Murphy's law, and a hitman consultant, MF Jones, played by Jamie Foxx, and a few absurd twists, and you have Horrible Bosses.Three horrible bosses.  Three disgruntled employess.  You kill my boss.  I kill yours.  No one will suspect any of us.  Makes perfect sense.  Nothing could possibly go wrong.  Right?  Right..Horrible Bosses has a wealth of talent, including two Academy Award winners.  It's amusing, gripping, absurd, and has some surprising twists and turns.It has some outstanding scenes, particularly Jennifer Aniston's hot portrayal of the oversexed over the top maneating dentist, who does unthinkable things with her sleeping patients, and tries the patience of her unfortunate just got engaged assistant.  Not just a sexual overtone.  More like a sexual symphony.Last year she was in a clever movieThe Switch (2010), also starring Jason Bateman, and a scene stealing kid, and it's apparent that comedy more than drama is her strength and passion, and improvisation her forte as she showed in the recentJust Go With It, which I totally loved.  For her the clock appears to run backwards rather than forwards, and her talent and presence continues to grow.Combed over Colin Farrell is almost unrecognisable as the idiotic heir to a chemical company with chemical dependency issues, while Kevin Spacey reprises the familiar psychotic role.If you like this movie, check out director Seth Gordon'sThe King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters, given two thumbs up by Ebert and Roeper.  Think of it as the Spinal Tap meets Donkey Kong. Truly outstanding.If you're like me, it doesn't matter if you watch it in the theater or on dvd, I think you will love it.  And, if you do have a horrible boss, send him or her a copy of this movie.  They might get the hint.  They might not get the hint.I hope you found this review helpful.",4,Jennifer Aniston.

Even Dale; a dental assistant who's being sexually harrassed by his hot chick boss; is justified because he wants to remain monogamous to his fianc&eacute;e. Those constant advances are supposed to be funny, and sometimes they are, but the sexist double standard they take advantage of isn't lost on me.Still, as far as malice goes, the dentist is by far the least horrible of the three bosses. She is at-least attracted to Dale in a positive way. His two best friends; Nick and Kurt; have to put-up with bosses who seem to hate them right back. So, sitting in a bar one day, the three goofballs come-up with the idea to kill their bosses. And once that plot point is set, you're hooked in; waiting to see how everything is going to turn-out in the end.It's too bad the story doesn't go for real suspense. It's built upon a simple yet potentially brilliant concept that could've worked wonders in a more serious movie. As a comedy; one that's consistently almost funny but never really funny; everything from how horrible the bosses are to how the workers go about planning to kill them is caricatured to unrealistic proportions.

The plot is pretty simple, three guys hate their bosses and go from talking about killing them, to actually planning to kill them when things go wrong.  I think all of the actors did a great job.  Bateman was very much like his character from Arrested Development with looser morals.  Aniston really stole the show in a role that was totally different than anything she had ever played before.  You can tell she was just trying to play it as over the top as possible.  The other one who just really got into the role was Spacy.  He played his character without any redeeming qualities and really did make you hate him.Like I said if you like the brand of humor then you will like this movie.  There is a lot of sexual humor (mostly involving Aniston's character), and some bathroom humor.  It is mainly about the stupid plan put together and badly executed by the main characters.  From trying to find a hitman, to the reconnaissance gone wrong everything just sort of spirals out of control.  The special features include deleted scenes and a couple behind the scenes things.  Nothing too extensive though, so if you are only inclined to get the actual discs when there are a lot of good bonus material you may just want to rent it.

1403929,A3D732EQ36IHO8,B004EPZ084,"Mo ""Grim Reaper""","[1, 4]","The premise of this film (based on the trailers put out by the studio) is straightforward and entertaining. Three employees tired of their employers decide to kill each others' boss. Throughout the first third of the film, I thought, ""this is as gratifying as Hangover was."" But the more of the film I watched, the more apparent it became that that (consecutive ""thats"" not a typo) was not the case. The film is not bad, in fact, like my title conveys, the movie is actually good. Jason Bateman, Charlie Day, and Jason Sudeikis mesh well together and their friendship is believable. Also, the supporting characters, Kevin Spacey, Colin Farrell, and Jennifer Aniston, only make the picture stronger. Of all the actors in this movie, Kevin Spacey is clearly the better and more authentic artisan of them all. Everybody's seen a boss/coworker/friend/rival like this guy. Another positive is that this movie is not short on comedic material. There is a lot in every scene. This is good for people who either love to laugh or laugh easily. And a final positive of this movie is that this is a really good Friday night movie. It made me enjoy my Friday night.Now for a few negatives. I have two major ones. The first detrimental quality of the film is that it didn't reach the potential that I felt it could've had and that was largely due to the writing. The writing for this movie is not witty or insanely funny. The film is not unfunny, it's just moderately funny. I genuinely laughed like two or three times total throughout the 106/107 minutes the film ran, three or four times total depending on whether you want to count the cut scenes that were playing during the closing credits (which is kind of strange because Colin Farrell was as funny if not funnier in the closing scenes that were edited out than he was in the actual movie). The second disagreement that I had with the film is that I had an internal feeling from start to finish as I was watching this movie that the film had been rushed so that it would be shown in theaters on short notice to capitalize on the anti-establishment/populous sentiment that was really high in this country with regards to the countless bailouts and unethical practices by Wall Street that eventually bought the entire world economy to a collapse. That feeling that I got of them of putting out an expedited product felt a little disingenuous to me. It's very apparent to me that I don't think they would've had the idea or motivation to make a film like this when the economy was better and people weren't out in the streets protesting.If I could, I'd give this movie three and a half stars out of five, but since I can't, I decided to give it four stars instead of three partly because Aniston was crazy hot in this film. I'm not obsessed with her as I see many guys who know about her are. Personally, I'm into women who have a different body type than she does, and I don't generally find her light skin tone attractive either, but she was really hot here. The film also received four stars instead of three because as I mentioned above, it was a good way to spend a Friday night.",4,"Good Movie, But Neither ""Great"" Nor On Hangover's Level (Not a Spoiler)",1324080000,"12 17, 2011",2011,3125,"['premise', 'film', 'based', 'trailers', 'put', 'out', 'studio', 'straightforward', 'entertaining', 'Three', 'employees', 'tired', 'employers', 'decide', 'kill', 'others', 'boss', 'first', 'third', 'film', 'thought', 'as', 'gratifying', 'Hangover', 'was', 'more', 'film', 'watched', 'more', 'apparent', 'became', 'consecutive', 'thats', 'not', 'typo', 'was', 'not', 'case', 'film', 'not', 'bad', 'fact', 'title', 'conveys', 'movie', 'actually', 'good', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'Charlie', 'Day', 'Jason', 'Sudeikis', 'mesh', 'well', 'together', 'friendship', 'believable', 'Also', 'supporting', 'characters', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'only', 'make', 'picture', 'stronger', 'actors', 'movie', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'clearly', 'better', 'more', 'authentic', 'artisan', 'Everybody', 'seen', 'boss/coworker/friend/rival', 'guy', 'positive', 'movie', 'not', 'short', 'comedic', 'material', 'lot', 'scene', 'good', 'people', 'who', 'love', 'laugh', 'laugh', 'easily', 'final', 'positive', 'movie', 'really', 'good', 'Friday', 'night', 'movie', 'made', 'enjoy', 'Friday', 'night.Now', 'few', 'negatives', 'have', 'two', 'major', 'ones', 'first', 'detrimental', 'quality', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'reach', 'potential', 'felt', 'could', ""'ve"", 'had', 'was', 'largely', 'due', 'writing', 'writing', 'movie', 'not', 'witty', 'insanely', 'funny', 'film', 'not', 'unfunny', 'just', 'moderately', 'funny', 'genuinely', 'laughed', 'two', 'three', 'times', 'total', '106/107', 'minutes', 'film', 'ran', 'three', 'four', 'times', 'total', 'depending', 'want', 'count', 'cut', 'scenes', 'were', 'playing', 'closing', 'credits', 'kind', 'strange', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'was', 'funny', 'not', 'funnier', 'closing', 'scenes', 'were', 'edited', 'out', 'was', 'actual', 'movie', 'second', 'disagreement', 'had', 'film', 'had', 'internal', 'feeling', 'start', 'finish', 'was', 'watching', 'movie', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'rushed', 'so', 'would', 'be', 'shown', 'theaters', 'short', 'notice', 'capitalize', 'anti-establishment/populous', 'sentiment', 'was', 'really', 'high', 'country', 'regards', 'countless', 'bailouts', 'unethical', 'practices', 'Wall', 'Street', 'eventually', 'bought', 'entire', 'world', 'economy', 'collapse', 'feeling', 'got', 'putting', 'out', 'expedited', 'product', 'felt', 'little', 'disingenuous', 'very', 'apparent', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', ""'ve"", 'had', 'idea', 'motivation', 'make', 'film', 'when', 'economy', 'was', 'better', 'people', 'were', ""n't"", 'out', 'streets', 'protesting.If', 'could', ""'d"", 'give', 'movie', 'three', 'half', 'five', 'ca', ""n't"", 'decided', 'give', 'four', 'stars', 'instead', 'three', 'partly', 'Aniston', 'was', 'crazy', 'hot', 'film', ""'m"", 'not', 'obsessed', 'see', 'many', 'guys', 'who', 'know', 'are', 'Personally', ""'m"", 'women', 'who', 'have', 'different', 'body', 'type', 'do', ""n't"", 'generally', 'find', 'light', 'skin', 'tone', 'attractive', 'was', 'really', 'hot', 'here', 'film', 'also', 'received', 'four', 'stars', 'instead', 'three', 'mentioned', 'was', 'good', 'way', 'spend', 'Friday', 'night']",N/A

1403955,A1L7LE6ARE47DW,B004EPZ084,pleasedie1979,"[2, 5]","Bad. Real bad. Some might say ""Horrible"". I laughed, well maybe just cracked a smile, around twice. I couldn't tell you what those scenes were though as I am trying to block this film from memory. DO NOT believe ANYONE saying this is a five star movie. It is not. Some SPOILERS in this review. But you can't really spoil this film.So where to begin??? OK the 'star' studded cast perhaps. I will start with this. Just because someone is a 'Star' doesn't mean they will make a movie funny. So back to the cast. The main focus is on the characters of Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikis and Charlie Day. All three characters are selfish and shallow, but one is also greatly annoying. They decide because their bosses are so 'horrible' they are going to kill them. Seems logical. But of course they run into some hysterical hyjinxs. Oh wait, no they don't. They just wander around like a couple of fools, while spewing some softball, but completely unfunny racial jokes, that involve another 'star'. Yes, Jamie Foxx is in this film. Why you ask? I'm guessing they paid him well. As for his role in the film, he plays a phoney 'hitman' that the gang offers to pay to eliminate their bosses for them. He accepts. But here's the funny part, he takes the money and instead of killing them, he offers his comical advise on HOW to kill them. Now get ready to laugh. No wait, not yet. So these three scallywags, do some investigating on their bosses and get into some pretty sticky situations, such as shoving a toothbrush into ones rectum, getting high through some 2nd hand cocaine and having sex with Jennifer Aniston. I know, please refrain from laughing yet though, there are more characters to come!Another cast member who received a lovely paycheck was Jen Aniston. And yes, after watching this movie I get to call her Jen. She plays one of the 'horrible' bosses. Her character is a sex obsessed dentist who desperately wants to bed one of the annoying gentlemen I mentioned before. How horrible huh. There is nothing more vile I can think of than a fantastic looking woman with a great job wanting to sleep with me! But that's the funny part!!! Oh wait, no it isn't. Next is another big name, Kevin Spacey. He plays Bateman's boss. A mean, spiteful, arrogant man who apparently deserves to die. Well I'll tell you what, if someone didn't give me a promotion, I'd kill them. Oh wait, no I'm wrong again, I would never in a million years do that. And the last boss is a self obsessed coke addict with a rivetingly funny performance by Colin Farrell. I mean you really do have to see it to believe it. Hmmmmm, nope, wrong again, sorry.

However, it seems that the Hollywood creators are watching cheap porn all day long and then represent it in their pictures. What's worse; the vulgar parts are not even remotely funny.

Unfortunately, their roles are all small ones. Sadly, the viewer is subjected to another modern day Hollywood comedy that isn't funny. This one with 3 male leads who spend 95% of the movie on screen together with no chemistry of any kind. Sutherland dies in the first 5 minutes which he was no doubt happy about once he realized the poor quality of the script. We are left with the 3 lead actors who try as hard as they can to pretend there is some sort of comic chemistry between them but it comes off as forced and strained, at best. Jason Bateman is a fine actor, yes, but here he is hopelessly lost in a terrible movie.  Jason Sudeikis and Charlie Day, however,  appear destined to spend their careers being cast in National Lampoon movies or a similar franchise where the goal is to appeal to the bodily-function-as-humor crowd with a few dick jokes thrown in. Charlie Day is especially annoying. He has the worst voice I have ever heard in the history of film.  When he goes into his cringe-inducing, high pitched whine, even my dog leaves the room with a disgusted look on his face. The producers would have been better off making another movie using the talented supporting cast instead of these 3 fools. Aniston & Foxx were good. Spacey played a jerk boss exactly how you would expect him to, but he does such roles so well it works everytime.

1403994,A3F0HT2YG3X6CD,B004EPZ084,"Serkan Okar ""movie and music connoisseur""","[2, 2]","I think Horrible Bosses is a really funny movie; I rate it 5 star and hold it equal to some of the best comedies of the last 5 years (The Hangover, 40 year-old Virgin, Little Miss Sunshine). Considering the crude sexual jokes that seem to be prevalent in many recent comedies, I thought Horrible Bosses was very decent, except for a scene or two.I think Jennifer Aniston was awesome, she was hot, she was funny, and her acting was great. Actually, all of the actors did a terrific job. Colin Farrell, like Jennifer Aniston, was  in a very unusual role where he showcased his comedic skills which I didn't know he had. Kevin Spacey is great as usual; his portrayal of evil boss with gigantic ego was amazing (although his character gets too crazy in the end).Totally Inappropriate Blu-ray edition has some extra scenes that are not in the theatrical release but they are not that many. I've seen this at the theaters recently and if my memory serves me rights, the following scenes are extra:- When MotherFxxxx talks about the incident how he acquired the name MotherFxxxx, there is a flashback depicting the story- There is an extra scene which shows Bobby having sex with some prostitutesI really don't care for the Ultraviolet format as I watch my movies on big screen TV. I know many reviewers rated this 1 star due to their dislike for Ultraviolet format. I don't think it's fair to rate a Blu-ray product just 1 star due to dislike for only one of the formats offered with the product (but everybody is entitled to their opinion).If you like this movie, I recommend this version (I bought it for $15 from Amazon, which I think is a great price; Target and FYE have the same version for $20).",5,Horrible Bosses Blu-ray Totally Inappropriate Edition,1335744000,"04 30, 2012",2012,1696,"['think', 'Horrible', 'Bosses', 'really', 'funny', 'movie', 'rate', '5', 'star', 'hold', 'equal', 'best', 'comedies', 'last', '5', 'years', 'Hangover', '40', 'year-old', 'Virgin', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'Considering', 'crude', 'sexual', 'jokes', 'seem', 'be', 'prevalent', 'many', 'recent', 'comedies', 'thought', 'Horrible', 'Bosses', 'was', 'very', 'decent', 'scene', 'two.I', 'think', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'was', 'awesome', 'was', 'hot', 'was', 'funny', 'acting', 'was', 'great', 'Actually', 'actors', 'did', 'terrific', 'job', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'was', 'very', 'unusual', 'role', 'where', 'showcased', 'comedic', 'skills', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'had', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'great', 'usual', 'portrayal', 'evil', 'boss', 'gigantic', 'ego', 'was', 'amazing', 'character', 'too', 'crazy', 'end', '.Totally', 'Inappropriate', 'Blu-ray', 'edition', 'extra', 'scenes', 'are', 'not', 'theatrical', 'release', 'are', 'not', 'many', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'theaters', 'recently', 'memory', 'serves', 'rights', 'following', 'scenes', 'are', 'extra', 'When', 'MotherFxxxx', 'talks', 'incident', 'how', 'acquired', 'name', 'MotherFxxxx', 'flashback', 'depicting', 'story-', 'extra', 'scene', 'Bobby', 'having', 'sex', 'prostitutesI', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'Ultraviolet', 'format', 'watch', 'movies', 'big', 'screen', 'TV', 'know', 'many', 'reviewers', 'rated', '1', 'star', 'due', 'dislike', 'Ultraviolet', 'format', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'fair', 'rate', 'Blu-ray', 'product', 'just', '1', 'star', 'due', 'dislike', 'only', 'one', 'formats', 'offered', 'product', 'everybody', 'entitled', 'opinion', '.If', 'movie', 'recommend', 'version', 'bought', '15', 'Amazon', 'think', 'great', 'price', 'Target', 'FYE', 'have', 'same', 'version', '20']",N/A

The script looks like it was written by some junior high boys drinking their first beers, complete with gay and straight sexual experimentation.  Kevin Spacey was the only actor worth watching, and the only boss that seemed even slightly realistic.  Until his jealousy gets the better of him and his gun, anyway, then it's as ludicrous as all the rest.  The story starts and stops with Bateman's musings on bosses, and his is the only character of the three that almost displays some common sense.  Almost, and that's only at times.NO such bosses could get away with 1/10th of what these losers do, especially the reverse sex discrimination (how original---NOT), or rape as it really is, by the very hot Jennifer Anniston character (a dentist?  Riiight).  What would she even see in the little Jewish guy?  A babe like that would NOT be a dentist or hitting on wimpy guys like him.  No way.  Farrell's character was just hideously ugly and disgusting, and not even Martin Sheen could be as blind and stupid about his son's drug use as this characters father (Donald Sutherland) was.Perhaps worst of all, Sudeikis is clearly gay (why anyone would think to stick someone else's toothbrush and every other lavatory item up their butt for a slow deep rub is beyond me, unless they like it, which the character clearly does, since he smiles and sighs with every exertion.  Plus, he uses every item in the bathroom this way.  Nice).  The bathroom scene is bad enough, but then he starts obsessing over getting raped in prison because he's so hot, and how much more raped he'd be than Bateman's character.  Odd that that would be his only real concern, but again, this is juvenile behavior at it's lowest.A terrible movie, one of the worst ever.  I spent $1 to watch it, and I feel ripped off.  If you want to see juvenile frat boys that are funny, credible, and still raunchy and sex-starved, then go see Animal House again.

But it wouldn't be the complete movie that it is without the absolutely perfect cast who act their own parts out with perfection, but also exhibit a chemistry together that is unparalleled in any movie that I've recently seen.And hats off to the writer/producer/director team for putting together a familiar story line that is ultimately pulled off with originality, and most importantly, hilarity from start to finish. The humor is often rude, crude and probably a bit more than the average Jennifer Aniston movie fan bargained for. However I give Aniston a ton of credit for for adding to the success of this film by effortlessly making her character believable, funny and shocking. After all the goody two-shoes roles that I'm used to seeing Aniston in, watching her in a ""bad girl"" role only made the movie more refreshing and entertaining.Colin Farrell was another great cast as one of the Horrible Bosses. He's transformed into a pot-bellied, balding drug addict and almost unrecognizable a la Tom Cruise inTropic Thunder. Farrell is Jason Sudeikis' boss. Kevin Spacey is Jason Bateman's boss, and Spacey is a natural crass meanie. Then Anistion is a the boss of a comical Charlie Day. The individual bosses deal out their own styles of harassment on the job and it's all darkly hysterical. So the three guys are given the notion that they could take each other's bosses out to make their lives easier. The events following this brainstorm of an idea are equally dark and laugh out loud funny.If you're looking for laughs you'll find them o'plenty in Horrible Bosses.

The plot deals with three best friends who share one element in common: they all have the boss from hell. The trio decide they have had enough and attempt a plot to kill their nasty employers by hiring a hitman.What makes the movie work is the hilarious script and the wonderful acting of the leads and the excellent supporting cast. Jason Bateman is great to look at (as always), Kevin Spacey, Colin Farrell (I actually didn't recognize him), and Jamie Fox give memorable performances, but for me the gem in this movie is the beautiful Jennifer Aniston. She plays a dentist who is nothing short of a sex maniac and is determined to bed her male dental assistant. Jennifer's portrayal borders on a combination of Joan Crawford/Bette Davis/Annie Wilkes/ and Alexis Carrington all rolled into one. Picture the biggest bitch you have ever seen portrayed in movies or television, multiply it by ten and you have this character.

1404019,A27MOT4ZIUAKIW,B004EPZ084,The Jaundiced Eye,"[3, 4]","I am a huge fan of bawdy, gross-out comedies by directors such as Judd Apatow and the Farrelly Brothers. I watched the bathroom scene in Hall Pass about 10 times, laughing until I wept. In fact, I would have sworn that no amount of coarseness, vulgarity, bad taste, or political incorrectness could interfere with my enjoyment of movie.....until I watched Horrible Bosses.What a colossal disappointment! Each of the cast members has been outstanding in at least one previous comedy; but, with the exception of old pro Kevin Spacey, each was dismally inept in this one. Most of all, I cannot imagine what motivated Jennifer Anniston to accept the utterly thankless role of a revolting, foul-mouthed nymphomaniac. Is her career in such a decline that this was the best she could do? When a beautiful woman spouts filth, it has to be convincing; but in this case it was more a source of embarrassment (for her) than titillation. It was like watching a close friend get drunk and humiliate themselves in public, while you wince at their idiotic behavior and pray that you can eventually erase it from your memory. In this case, I don't think I can.When you get a group of proven, talented actors together and the result of their collaboration is pure trash, the responsibility must fall upon the script, the director, or both. Granted, there were a few glimmers of humor in the production, but they were smothered by long periods of boredom and slathered with gratuitous vulgarity that simply was not funny. If a character's role contains inadequate humor, like that of Jamie Foxx, then simply give him an outrageous name and repeat it over and over and over. The entire script reeked of Junior High School locker room humor and lacked any degree of finesse or underlying wit. Surely the majority of those involved in this production recognized its significant shortcomings, yet it was released, or should I say, inflicted, upon the public in its current form.The bottom line: any amount of crassness and vulgarity can be tolerated or even enjoyed if it is genuinely funny.

Nick works for Kevin Spacey who is a ridiculous driver and badgers Nick when he is 2 minutes late. Kurt works a chemical company. His new boss is a coke head who sees the business as an ATM machine and wants to run it into the ground. When he says he wants to ""trim the fat"" that means he wants to fire fat people. Dale, who is engaged, is a dental assistant to Jennifer Aniston, who wants to have sex with him. Even his close friends have trouble believing that is a problem.Kurt claims killing his boss, who wants to dump waste on the proverbial poor Bolivians would save lives and that they have a moral duty to kill their boss. Jennifer Aniston develops a comical potty mouth in this film, one that makes Madonna sound like Mother Teresa.After some very brief soul searching our trio decides life would be better without their bosses. However getting to that point is not easy. The movie takes some unexpected twists. The role of Dale (Charlie Day) was clearly written with Zach Galifianakis in mind.

What made this film stand out from other raunchy comedies, was that there wasn't just one super funny guy that the other played off of. Every character had their moment and was funny in their own way. The story was fairly original too. Three miserable guys decide all their problems would end if they kill each other's boss and they go on a hilarious mission to get the job done. While I love the idea and thought the movie was genuinely funny, what it lacks is character development. Other than the abuses they face at work, you don't really know too much about these guys and where they are coming from. I feel like that weakened the film, but what more than makes up for it is a ton of hilarious cameos. I love cameos and there are some great ones from Jennifer Aniston, Jamie Foxx, Donald Sutherland, Bob Newhart, and Collin  Farrell.

When the wheels start rolling it isn't long until they fall off and things don't go as planned. This is a movie I had high hoped for. I think that Jason Bateman is one of the funniest people and the plot seemed like it would be awesome. While I did like this movie it was a little disappointing. The funniest parts in this one they began to do over and over and by the fifth time they did the joke it wasn't that funny anymore. I do think that the hype behind this one, as well as watching the ""Change Up"" before this one had a lot to do with my opinion though. All the actors are perfectly cast and there are laughs, but it's not a constant laugh-out-loud movie like I expected.

It seemed to promise the same kind of that's-so-my-boss! exclamations that Office Space did, but none of the villains in Horrible Bosses seem real except maybe Farrell's greedy drug-addict character. Spacey and Aniston are basically cartoons in this movie, and although that makes for a few chuckles here and there, their characters just don't feel analogous to any horrible boss that anyone in the audience is likely to have worked for.

1404040,A15U46ZENEHGTH,B004EPZ084,Wicked_Smaht,"[8, 11]","Horrible Bosses takes a darkly comic premise and pretty much plays it safe at every possible turn, which eventually results in a movie that thinks its funnier than it really is. It's a shame because the actors in the film are well cast in their respective roles, but the movie quickly devolves into the sort of sophomoric humor that passes for funny nowadays. Easily the best part of the movie are the bosses themselves played by Kevin Spacey (who's great at playing severe a-holes), Jennifer Aniston (in a nice bit of stunt casting that's a refreshing difference from her usual Rachel-centric roles) and Colin Farrell (who excels at playing the King of the Douchebags). It's strange, given that their characters are so one-dimensional, but the energy and malevolence they put into their roles goes a long way towards working in the movie's favor. Unfortunately, they only have about 20 minutes of screentime total throughout the movie and then we're stuck watching the sometimes tedious shenanigans of Jason Bateman, Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis as the oft put-upon underlings who have to deal with an elitist jerk, a crazy nympho and a complete tool. Bateman, Day and Sudeikis do what they can with their roles, but they're really just not as engaging a character as their horrible bosses. As a result, the movie loses steam severely in its second half when it focuses more on these guys and their dumb attempts to off their employers.Part of the problem is that the Day/Aniston conflict just never rings true as a really horrible situation (a fact that several characters in the film even admit to not really being a problem), so the story has to go to implausible lengths to present the situation as undesirable, much to the detriment of the central plot of the film. Sure, it's easy to hate the other two bosses, but I think most people will just wonder why Aniston's oversexed antics warrant her being killed. The sad part is that the movie seems to realize this, so this particular conflict is the least addressed in the film. Instead of making Aniston's character older or more undesirable (read: less attractive), the movie might've gotten more mileage out of the situation. But then, you'd probably have people criticizing the movie because it infers that older or less gorgeous is not sexy and this movie can't afford to alienate anybody, so they play it safe instead.Our three leads also never actually kill any of their bosses (at least, not directly), so the movie wimps out on that sticky plot point as well. Instead you have three guys presented as seemingly smart and capable in their professions act like total f'ing morons for the last hour of the movie. It's boring, it's tired and you've seen this kind of comedic flailing around several times before. There's also the weird notion where the film tries to present Sudeikis as some kind of irresistible lothario who not only hooks up with Aniston, but Julie Bowen as well. This notion, like the movie, just seems like some sort of juvenile wish-fulfillment presented as a ""hilarious"" movie.Ultimately, if you have no awareness of comedies pre-2000, you'll love this film. If you've enjoyed the work of the Zucker brothers, Mel Brooks or even Chevy Chase, you probably won't like this. It starts off strong and sets up a great idea, but then just completely misses the mark by channeling a Hangover type of comedy that never really does the central plot any justice. This movie is the comedic equivalent to a horror film that cuts out all the gore and grue in order to get a PG rating. While this movie is rated R, it's only because of the f-bomb and some racy dialogue, which is a hallmark of lazy comedy. Think of it like Bob Saget - sure, it was funny for a moment after Full House got cancelled and he just said the foulest things he could think of because he was on a family friendly show for so long... but then the novelty wears off and you're left with a not particularly funny comedian. That's what this movie is: one big Bob Saget. It was funny for a minute, but then ultimately just became tedious.3 stars for a promising first half and 1 star for a disappointing second half. As a whole, Horrible Bosses gets 2 stars. Worth a look if you want to see Jennifer Aniston not be Rachel for awhile and to see Kevin Spacey return to the a-hole roles he does so well, but you probably won't watch it again.",2,"Horrible Bosses = Bob Saget: Funny for a moment, but ultimately, just tedious...",1321920000,"11 22, 2011",2011,4381,"['Horrible', 'Bosses', 'darkly', 'comic', 'premise', 'pretty', 'much', 'plays', 'safe', 'possible', 'turn', 'eventually', 'results', 'movie', 'funnier', 'really', 'shame', 'actors', 'film', 'are', 'well', 'cast', 'respective', 'roles', 'movie', 'quickly', 'sort', 'sophomoric', 'humor', 'funny', 'nowadays', 'Easily', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'are', 'bosses', 'played', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'who', 'great', 'playing', 'severe', 'a-holes', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'nice', 'bit', 'stunt', 'casting', 'refreshing', 'difference', 'usual', 'Rachel-centric', 'roles', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'who', 'excels', 'playing', 'King', 'Douchebags', 'strange', 'given', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'one-dimensional', 'energy', 'malevolence', 'put', 'roles', 'long', 'way', 'towards', 'working', 'movie', 'favor', 'Unfortunately', 'only', 'have', '20', 'minutes', 'screentime', 'total', 'movie', 'then', ""'re"", 'stuck', 'watching', 'sometimes', 'tedious', 'shenanigans', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'Charlie', 'Day', 'Jason', 'Sudeikis', 'oft', 'put-upon', 'underlings', 'who', 'have', 'deal', 'elitist', 'jerk', 'crazy', 'nympho', 'complete', 'tool', 'Bateman', 'Day', 'Sudeikis', 'do', 'what', 'can', 'roles', ""'re"", 'really', 'just', 'not', 'engaging', 'character', 'horrible', 'bosses', 'result', 'movie', 'steam', 'severely', 'second', 'half', 'when', 'more', 'guys', 'dumb', 'attempts', 'off', 'employers.Part', 'problem', 'Day/Aniston', 'conflict', 'just', 'never', 'true', 'really', 'horrible', 'situation', 'fact', 'several', 'characters', 'film', 'even', 'admit', 'not', 'really', 'being', 'problem', 'story', 'go', 'implausible', 'lengths', 'present', 'situation', 'undesirable', 'much', 'detriment', 'central', 'plot', 'film', 'Sure', 'easy', 'hate', 'other', 'two', 'bosses', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'just', 'wonder', 'why', 'Aniston', 'oversexed', 'antics', 'warrant', 'being', 'killed', 'sad', 'part', 'movie', 'realize', 'particular', 'conflict', 'least', 'addressed', 'film', 'Instead', 'making', 'Aniston', 'character', 'older', 'more', 'undesirable', 'read', 'less', 'attractive', 'movie', 'might', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'more', 'mileage', 'situation', 'then', ""'d"", 'probably', 'have', 'people', 'criticizing', 'movie', 'older', 'less', 'gorgeous', 'not', 'sexy', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'alienate', 'anybody', 'play', 'safe', 'instead.Our', 'three', 'leads', 'also', 'never', 'actually', 'kill', 'bosses', 'least', 'not', 'directly', 'movie', 'out', 'sticky', 'plot', 'point', 'as', 'well', 'Instead', 'have', 'three', 'guys', 'presented', 'seemingly', 'smart', 'capable', 'professions', 'act', 'total', ""f'ing"", 'morons', 'last', 'hour', 'movie', 'boring', 'tired', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'kind', 'comedic', 'flailing', 'around', 'several', 'times', 'before', 'also', 'weird', 'notion', 'where', 'film', 'tries', 'present', 'Sudeikis', 'kind', 'irresistible', 'lothario', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'up', 'Aniston', 'Julie', 'Bowen', 'as', 'well', 'notion', 'movie', 'just', 'sort', 'juvenile', 'wish-fulfillment', 'presented', 'hilarious', 'movie.Ultimately', 'have', 'awareness', 'comedies', 'pre-2000', ""'ll"", 'love', 'film', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'work', 'Zucker', 'brothers', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'even', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'strong', 'up', 'great', 'idea', 'then', 'just', 'completely', 'mark', 'channeling', 'Hangover', 'type', 'comedy', 'never', 'really', 'central', 'plot', 'justice', 'movie', 'comedic', 'equivalent', 'horror', 'film', 'out', 'gore', 'grue', 'order', 'get', 'PG', 'rating', 'movie', 'rated', 'R', 'only', 'f-bomb', 'racy', 'dialogue', 'hallmark', 'lazy', 'comedy', 'Think', 'Bob', 'Saget', 'sure', 'was', 'funny', 'moment', 'Full', 'House', 'got', 'cancelled', 'just', 'said', 'foulest', 'things', 'could', 'think', 'was', 'family', 'friendly', 'show', 'so', 'long', 'then', 'novelty', ""'re"", 'left', 'not', 'particularly', 'funny', 'comedian', 'what', 'movie', 'one', 'big', 'Bob', 'Saget', 'was', 'funny', 'minute', 'then', 'ultimately', 'just', 'became', 'tedious.3', 'stars', 'promising', 'first', 'half', '1', 'star', 'disappointing', 'second', 'half', 'whole', 'Horrible', 'Bosses', '2', 'stars', 'look', 'want', 'see', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'not', 'be', 'Rachel', 'awhile', 'see', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'return', 'a-hole', 'roles', 'so', 'well', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'watch', 'again']",N/A
