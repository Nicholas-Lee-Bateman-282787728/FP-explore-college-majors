822493,ALB3PT6GQ9SJ7,B00023BLXK,Adam Friant,"[5, 5]","Amazing Story based on real events that happened over fifty years  ago  during political chaos in Cuba has little connection to the Dirty Dancing masterpiece of the 1980s, except for the name and a certain extended cameo appearance by one of the original film's stars, that is.HAVANA NIGHTS tells a  compelling story of a young girl forced to relocate to Cuba when her father gets a job over there and ends up meeting a local boy who teaches her how to tap into her spiritual side by self expression in the form of dancing. Her parents of course are portrayed as old fuddie duddies at first but eventually come to realise their daughter is old enough to choose what she wants out of life, and inevitably she and the boy fall in love.Entering a dance competition,  the two  take to the floor and astound  just about everyone present.But before  the young dancers are able to  fully  embrace the passion required for the moves in the contest, some necessary help is gained  by a certain dance instructor who will no doubt be very familiar to just about every female on the planet, and movie lovers everywhere.  Patrick Swayze appears for several scenes and provides rather memorable moments that really add to the overall enjoyment of the story, making this an amazing cinematic experiece that will take your breath away! Also his dance partner in the first scene at the dance studio is in reality the woman whose life this film is based on. This only makes this movie rate even higher for all the cleverness that comes out of it.I got this DVD  this morning as a Christmas gift from my parents and just now finished it and sat down to write this review, so you know it is that good. Also of note is the song you hear at the end of the film when the young lovers have their last dance. It is called ""Hips Don't Lie"" and is by Shakira, and available on her most recent release.Order HAVANA NIGHTS today and have a very  Merry Christmas!!

822496,A2ERKE0L4DPUC4,B00023BLXK,Angel,"[0, 0]","I knew it wouldn't be as good as the original, but I don't think it is as bad as it has been made out to be, particularly the dancing. From what I could see of the actors, they looked really good. Unfortunately, the camera almost always shot them from the waist up so you couldn't really feel the dance or even know if they weren't messing up. The only thing you could make out was whether they were supposed to be dirty or ballroom dancing. In fact, the only dance I could see clearly, and thus the most riveting, was the recreation of the original dirty dance with the Patrick Swayze cameo. Even when the actors finally get to their big routine you don't get to see much of it due to camera angles and the plot twist. I only harp on the dancing aspects because I am sure many other people will be interested in this movie, as I was, for dancing. The dancing is good but you see so little of it is not very inspiring.In fact, it didn't really feel like a dancing movie. The dancing almost seemed to be a subplot to the Cuban revolution theme. The themes of the  different social classes and the revolution felt trite though. It didn't seem to fit in the movie too fluidly and it was not dealt with in depth.Other detractions of the movie were the simplictic language used, the youthful pubescent look of the leading man which made it hard to look at him dirty dance without feeling uncomfortable, and the inconsistent texture of the movie. What I mean by texture is nothing that really detracts from the plot, just little things which seem implausible. I found it hard to believe this rich, protective, socialite family would, upon discovering their young, high school daughter's romantic relationship with a lower class Cuban would allow her to spend entire nights away from the family in revolutionary Cuba.On a more positive note, the visual look of the movie made it a treat for the eyes. The colors and scenery were delectable. The music was a pleasure to hear. And although the dialogue is simple, it is pleasantly interspersed with Spanish language (which is refreshing after seeing many movies set in other countries where not only do the main characters not speak the language, but have no accent!).Overall, the movie is not hard to watch. It is rather pleasant. However it is not exactly a must-see and of course it does not compare to Dirty Dancing.",3,"Not as bad as I had heard, but not good...",1091059200,"07 29, 2004",2004,2361,"['knew', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'as', 'bad', 'been', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'particularly', 'dancing', 'what', 'could', 'see', 'actors', 'looked', 'really', 'good', 'Unfortunately', 'camera', 'almost', 'always', 'shot', 'waist', 'up', 'so', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'feel', 'dance', 'even', 'know', 'were', ""n't"", 'messing', 'up', 'only', 'thing', 'could', 'make', 'out', 'was', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'dirty', 'ballroom', 'dancing', 'fact', 'only', 'dance', 'could', 'see', 'clearly', 'thus', 'most', 'riveting', 'was', 'recreation', 'original', 'dirty', 'dance', 'Patrick', 'Swayze', 'cameo', 'Even', 'when', 'actors', 'finally', 'get', 'big', 'routine', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'much', 'due', 'camera', 'angles', 'plot', 'twist', 'only', 'harp', 'dancing', 'aspects', 'am', 'sure', 'many', 'other', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'interested', 'movie', 'was', 'dancing', 'dancing', 'good', 'see', 'so', 'little', 'not', 'very', 'inspiring.In', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'feel', 'dancing', 'movie', 'dancing', 'almost', 'seemed', 'be', 'subplot', 'Cuban', 'revolution', 'theme', 'themes', 'different', 'social', 'classes', 'revolution', 'felt', 'trite', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'fit', 'movie', 'too', 'fluidly', 'was', 'not', 'dealt', 'depth.Other', 'detractions', 'movie', 'were', 'simplictic', 'language', 'used', 'youthful', 'pubescent', 'look', 'leading', 'man', 'made', 'hard', 'look', 'dirty', 'dance', 'feeling', 'uncomfortable', 'inconsistent', 'texture', 'movie', 'What', 'mean', 'texture', 'nothing', 'really', 'plot', 'just', 'little', 'things', 'seem', 'implausible', 'found', 'hard', 'believe', 'rich', 'protective', 'socialite', 'family', 'would', 'discovering', 'young', 'high', 'school', 'daughter', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'lower', 'class', 'Cuban', 'would', 'allow', 'spend', 'entire', 'nights', 'away', 'family', 'revolutionary', 'Cuba.On', 'more', 'positive', 'note', 'visual', 'look', 'movie', 'made', 'treat', 'eyes', 'colors', 'scenery', 'were', 'delectable', 'music', 'was', 'pleasure', 'hear', 'dialogue', 'simple', 'pleasantly', 'interspersed', 'Spanish', 'language', 'refreshing', 'seeing', 'many', 'movies', 'set', 'other', 'countries', 'where', 'not', 'only', 'do', 'main', 'characters', 'not', 'speak', 'language', 'have', 'accent', '.Overall', 'movie', 'not', 'hard', 'watch', 'rather', 'pleasant', 'However', 'not', 'exactly', 'must-see', 'course', 'not', 'compare', 'Dirty', 'Dancing']",Dirty Dancing - Havana Nights

The original is a classic-- the perfect 80s movie, but the new one is so much more sensual and emotional. My only complaint is that it ended much too quickly, without much closure for the audience, but otherwise this film is a joy to watch.Katie (Romola Garai) has just moved to pre-revolution Cuba. She's a total bookworm, but when she meets hotel waiter Javier (the marvelous Diego Luna) she's completely swept away. The basic story follows that of the original-- she doesn't know how to &quot;feel&quot; the music, her parents dissaprove of the guy she likes, preferring her to date the guy she hates.The cinematography is impressive, and the colors are amazing-- lots of reds and oranges. It's so picturesque. The performances were great, the dancing was wonderful (although I don't think the dancing was necessarily dirty, it was much more beautiful and sensual than the dancing in the original). I really like that Patrick Swayze makes an appearance as a dance instructor. His limited screen time is awesome.Definitely check this one out.

It was a disappointment across the board, with just a couple of bright spots. The interaction between the girl and her father was touching. The acting by the two young stars was in character, but the script was not up to par and the rest of the actors were handicapped by the lines and situations they were required to deliver. It was shocking to see Patrick Swayze looking so old in this film. It didn't do him or the film justice. He would have been better off in a serious role rather than the bit player he was here.The scriptwriter tried to do too many things in this film and as a consequence, accomplished none of them. The acting, the dancing, and the overall production were disappointing, to say the least. None of it was credible. I cannot understand anyone getting excited by this film, but that's just me and my tastes.

That's because viewers step into the movie with a mindset of preconceived notions and expectations.  I must admit that I was one of those viewers, avoiding this film at all costs, until this past weekend.That's when I entered the world of ""Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights"" and fell in love with what I saw.  I honestly feel as if this movie has some of the sexiest dance scenes I've seen, and the art direction is simply fabulous.  The costumes and hairstyling are also very well done.  Although mainstream American  audiences will not recognize most of the cast members, Diego Luna puts on an amazing act as Javier Suarez, an intelligent, enticing waiter at a Cuban resort.  Jonathan Jackson's performance as a slick badboy is a little unconvincing, but then again, many of the film's characters go underdeveloped.Nonetheless, I'd still recommend ""DD:HN"" just for the sake of fun.  It's perfect for a night in with the girls or even for spending time with a significant other.

Absolutely NOT! So many times when film makers toy with older movies they never seem to come out right. For example Disney and the many sequels they torture us with. However, when I sat down and watched the movie I LOVED it! It got me really excited about dancing just as the first version had. I actually went to see the movie twice when it was in theaters. Something I had never really done before. The only reason I give it four stars is because I'm not that happy with the girl they chose to play Katie who was the Protagonist in the movie. Most of the time she was fine but sometimes I felt that she could have done a better job with some of her lines. Also there was the matter of the way Katie and her dance partner Javier express their feelings to each other. There really isn't a reckoning point. There are several points in the movie where I thought, ""Ok this is it. They're going to kiss each other and realize each others affections."" But it never really came that way. The first time we see them kiss is on the dance floor as the result of Javier's spontaneity. Then suddenly the next night they sleep with each other. It happens in a lot the same way in the first movie. If they were attempting to be more true to reality they missed the mark because I don't know if that is really something that would happen.

822521,A3CF7B2U0IB8PS,B00023BLXK,Katie,"[5, 6]","I understand that Dirty Dancing movies aren't going to be exactly like Citizen Kain.  But when you think about the premise, the culture and classist clash of American vs. Cuban dancing, sexuality, and budding romance set during the backdrop of the Revolution, the movie sounds quite promising.  I mean, when I heard the premise I thought ""This movie was MADE for me,"" because it has Cuban history and politics, awesome dancing (or so I assumed it would, due to its predecessor,) and, come on, the main character has the same name as me.  But I should have realized then that a good premise does not necessarily lead to a good, or even adequate, execution.I won't summarize the movie as so many others do; if you want a synopsis, look to their reviews.  I WILL point out what exactly I found so lacking about it, and why I do not feel it was that good of a movie, even when one considers that it's ultimately just a dance movie.  But again one must remember that it was their decision to involve politics in the movie, and in doing so they made themselves fair game--I do not believe in just using a deep political situation just to make a story line seem a little deeper; if it is not handled properly, it is insulting.First off, the romance.  Diego Luna and Romola Garai had definite chemistry, and it is so disappointing when you realize that the movie did not capitalize upon this, and all you're going to see in addition to some very sexually charged dancing is a few hurried onscreen kisses and an implied sex scene.  Given their chemistry and the buildup of their relationship, their first kiss could have been so much better, instead of just snuck in during a dance routine--it was so quick I spent many minutes wondering if I had really seen it or not.  However, to me chemistry is not the only thing required in an on-screen relationship, and I have no idea to this minute why Javier and Katey fell in love with each other.  Katey's personality was developed in the movie sense (she likes classic literature, is a bookworm and rather progressive for her time) and Javier was clearly the ""will do anything for his family and feels that Cuba is in need of a change"" but I don't really know how those two fit together.  Aside from the sexual attraction component, I have no idea what exactly they saw in each other to make their relationship anything more than ""He was hot, she was pretty, and she felt sorry for him.""  Some might argue that Katey was merely attracted to the intensity and freedom of the Cuban lifestyle embodied by Javier, but I ask you: the movie was founded upon the idea of a romance, and what the heck kind of relationship is that?I would also like to add that the Spanish conversations WITHOUT subtitles were incredibly rude to the audience.  I do speak Spanish, but I could not make much sense of the slurred words and to this day I am wondering what exactly Javier and his brother said to each other after the Revolution broke out.  Maybe they figured that the audience would not care (pfft, what are politics compared to SALSA DANCING,) but I cared.And now, the historical components.  I will not get into the anachronisms--such as Katey's parents' attitude towards her staying nights with a boy they don't know, and that even Cuba in the 50's could not have been that unrestrained--as there are many who could do that better justice than I (apparently the style of dancing in the movie was unlike what was popular in Cuba at the time.)  After all, it is only a dance movie.  I can ignore that stuff.  But when the movie brings the history to ME I cannot ignore it, and I further dislike it when movie directors assume that their audience is completely ignorant of certain aspects of history and will just assume that ""Man, that Batista guy was a jerk; he didn't allow dancing.  Hopefully life will be better under this new regime!  Who'd they say it was, some guy by the name of Fidel Something-or-Another?"" (I am exaggerating; at least I hope that no one is that ignorant.)And here we get to the backdrop of the story, Revolutionary Cuba.  First off, Batista's regime wasn't really shown to be that bad; aside from the story involving Javier's father, it might as well have been that town in Footloose (perhaps a little more violent.)  It was like Dictatorship Lite.  After Havana falls to Castro and co., the Cubans act happy (which is understandable) but things are otherwise pretty calm, which one cannot imagine is really likely in such a situation.And then we get to the ending.  Katey asks Javier to come to America with her.  In a move which my sister has deemed the ""stupidest decision in a movie ever,"" Javier refuses, saying that he has to stay because of the Revolution, which he believes (or wants to believe, anyway) will improve life for him and his people, Batista killed his free-thinking father, viva la Revoluci&oacute;n, yadda yadda yadda.  I understand that movies don't always have happy endings, but I think that there is a middle ground between ""boy and girl live happily ever after"" to ""girl lives happily ever after and boy gets sent to the gulag after he finds out that Castro isn't exactly the nice guy he claims to be and wow, Batista was a cakewalk compared to this, and has to spend his years in a drawer cell where he would kick himself for his earlier decision if, you know, he could actually kick himself, but drawer cells don't allow that.""  I truly think that the filmmakers did not anticipate their audience to think this much, which is understandable, but come on--everyone knows that communist Cuba is no picnic, and when Katey says something along the lines of ""I know that we'll meet again,"" I couldn't help but thinking that the only way THAT would happen would be if Javier braves the Gulf and takes up Florida's wet feet dry feet policy.  In fact, when I told my friend about the ending he said, ""that boy is going to have to stop dancing and learn to convert his '57 Chevy into a boat.""I understand that people at first thought that Castro was fantastic and he didn't reveal his true intentions until later, but the fact remains that Cuba was politically instable and to choose to stay there instead of going to America was still pretty questionable.

That said, there was also alot that attracted me to the film. The cast was great and the setting was beautiful. While the story was boring, it had charm. After the movie, I viewed the deleted scenes and realized that had they not been taken out, most of my complaints wouldn't exist. I hate when a movie is ruined because of test audience opinions. The deleted scenes in this case should have stayed because they added to the story rather than subtracted from it. Had that been the case, we would have had a much better movie.

822531,A2R4XG0L7Z01V8,B00023BLXK,"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ...","[1, 1]","I bought this film purely out of curiosity, and because I didn't see how they could make a sequel to Dirty Dancing, with a cast of unknowns. In reality, it's a ""based on true events"" (the plot is loosely based on the life story of producer JoAnn Jansen, who moved to Cuba with her family in 1958), and a stand alone film, which can be watched by those young kids who still haven't seen the original. Plus it's got a PG certificate, whereas the original had a PG-13 certificate. I know, big difference, but this one was really tame at times. Some scenes were only implied (their original first kiss was completely cut out of it, and they never slept together on-screen unlike the original.) Plus it was supposed to be set 5 years before the original was - the original was 1963, the sequel 1958, for anyone who can't add. Strange that, because with a 17 year difference between the original & the sequel, Patrick Swayze still looks the same.Patrick Swayze has little more than an extended cameo in this, playing a dancing instructor, and teaching much of the same moves that he taught Baby in the original. The lead guy definitely doesn't have as much charm or charisma as Patrick has in his little finger. Patrick shows he can still do the same moves he perfected 17 years ago, albeit sweatily.The music rocks in this movie. Instead of the same old dances & moves done in the original, it's more sexier and dirtier Cuban-inspired dancing. Most of the soundtrack I actually found was a turn-on (must be one of those days), especially the ""hoo-ha"" song! And if you listen closely, I heard it once near the end, there's a Cuban-inspired instrumental version of ""I've Had The Time Of My Life"".I wasn't keen on the male lead in this, as I've already mentioned, but Romola Garai who played Katey was fantastic, and very familiar-looking, although I haven't seen any of her other movies. Her little sister, was played by Mika Boorem, who was in the start of Riding In Cars With Boys. There was a little chemistry between the two lead actors, but not as much as Jennifer & Patrick. Romola played Katey a lot different to Baby, although the awkwardness comes through in the dancing scenes. I would love to dance like that, it's totally sexy, and great foreplay too.The film starts off very slow, and the first time I watched it, I actually switched it off 18 minutes into it, and put on something else instead. You have to persevere with this movie, cos believe me it does get better.I doubt I'll be getting my guy to sign up to be my Patrick Swayze anytime soon, but the dancing and Romola is definitely the best parts of this movies. You'll be dancing around the house after watching this, and I'm going off to dance in the shower now!

Thus, I was surprised to hear about ""Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights"" in 2004. Why did they wait so long? And is it a sequel, a prequel, a re-interpretation, or a whole movie on its own? Honestly, I think it did itself a disservice by having ""Dirty Dancing"" in the title. They were obviously trying to capitalize on the classic film, but the time to do that was closer to 1987, not 17 years later!This movie takes place in 1958, on the eve of Cuba's revolution, and opens similarly to ""Dirty Dancing"". The protagonist is a girl on the cusp of adulthood, riding in the back of the car and musing on her interests in life. In the original, Baby was an idealistic daddy's girl who dreamed of joining the Peace Corps in Kennedy's optimistic age of 1963. The years are significant, because Patrick Swayze has an extended cameo sequence as a dance instructor. Is he Johnny or not from the original movie? Hard to say, as the credits at the end of the film don't name him as that character, and in this film he looks a lot older (obviously), yet he's supposed to be five years younger than when he was in the original. Confusing?Well, taken as a completely separate film, it is entertaining with GREAT music. But purist for the Cuban music of the 1950s won't like it either, as it is definitely music blended from the traditions of Cuban style with the modern hip-hop rhythms that satisfy our feet. I love the music enough to buy the soundtrack, but as for watching the film over and over...I just didn't felt drawn in like the way ""Dirty Dancing"" did all those summers ago. That film had heart and was a surprise, under the radar discovery. This one, though based on the choreographer's life, seems to be attempting to cash in on the other's success, but it fails. Its proof that the magic some films have aren't easily transferrable to another. All the magical ingredients/elements have to be right, and this one simply fails to live up to the other. The smartest thing the producers could have done to promote the film was not use ""Dirty Dancing"" in the title. It might have done better in theaters. But then again, a film with a backdrop of the Cuban Revolution is a tough sell to American audiences anyway.So, skip the film and buy the soundtrack.

822540,A2L6QS8SVHT9RG,B00023BLXK,"randomartco ""period film aficionado""","[7, 8]","When Katey Miller (Romala Garai)'s parents announce that they are moving the family to Havana, Cuba for her father's job, she is a little less than thrilled.  In fact, she refuses to even speak to her family for a few days, giving them the famous silent treatment.  What 18 year-old would be thrilled at having to leave behind their school, friends, and familiar surroundings to move to a country that is on the brink of a revolution?!Bookish and shy A-student Katey arrives in Havana where her innate curiosity comes alive, as she becomes entranced by all the new sights and things around her.  She resolutely decides to try and make the best of her new home, and soon is pulled into life in Havana.  Although she is a bit quiet and standoffish to the other students at first (children of the ""smart set"": from the other well-to-do families staying at the Oceana Hotel), she soon catches the eye of one of the boys: her father's boss's son, James Phelps (Jonathan Jackson).  He becomes interested in her beauty and brains (as she ""shows up"" the other students in class), and begins to pursue her, while their mothers stand by encouraging.  One night as they are out on the town, Katey is completely put off by his snobbish manner and the way he looks down on the native Cubans and treats them like lowly servants.It is a local Cuban boy who works at the hotel, Javier Suarez (Diego Luna), who sparks her interest when by chance she happens to see him dancing in the streets of Havana. She is wide-eyed at the Latin steps, moving with a fluid rhythm and sensual grace like she has never seen anyone dance before.Katey soon tries to emulate the Latin influenced dance that she sees at the local nightclub, but without much success.  When it comes to the foxtrot, waltz, or other popular dances of the 1950's, Katey knows every step, but she knows nothing about Latin dance.  Patrick Swayze makes a cameo appearance in the film as a dance instructor at the Oceana Hotel: choice moments that the viewing audience went crazy over!  Katey's parents are retired Ballroom Dance Champions and are completely unaware of their daughter's growing rebellion, believing she is spending her days and nights out with the ""parent-approved"" James.  Instead, Katey is spending every moment she can with Javier: but he is about to show her that she knows nothing about moving her body to the beat of the music.  And as the revolution in Cuba swells on and their passion begins to grow...Content: For those of you worried about taking your kids: There is some language: a few uses of the Lord's name and a few swear words, not too much.  There is some violence when the Cuban police break up a party and a few times where people brandish a gun and threaten others.  Scenes at a Havana nightclub: the dancing often shows the guy putting his hands all over his partner as they are dancing: very sensual and sexual.  There is some passionate kissing, and a scene that shows a ""morning after"" type scene, but there is nothing too graphic.  There is dance practice on the beach and in the water, a woman slapping another in the face, a guy giving his unwanted attentions to a girl (mostly kissing, it stops in time).  Be aware though, that the entire tone of the film is very sexual, and is all about moving your body to the Latin rhythm with your dance partner.From the great Latin music to the beautiful dancing, this film is worth the watch (although I would definitely not take any little ones along).

Zwick,"[11, 14]","Patrick Swayze makes little more than a guest appearance in ""Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights,"" the misbegotten ""sequel"" to the 1987 box office smash that turned the actor into a bona fide movie star.This time around the focus is on Katey Miller (Romola Garai), a high school senior who moves with her family to Cuba in 1958, right on the eve of the Castro revolution.  While there, she goes from being a white-bread, college-bound bookworm to a hot-blooded Latin dancer under the tutelage of a young Cuban (""Y Tu Mama Tambien""'s Diego Luna) who works poolside at the hotel where she and many other Americans live. Naturally, her cavorting around with a dark-skinned native raises a whole host of hackles among the snooty foreigners who live only to feed off the sweat and hard work of the indigenous population.Naturally, it is the dancing that is the key element in a film of this type, but even the choreography, which isn`t really all that impressive to begin with, can't overcome the film's humdrum storyline, shallow characterizations and infantile view of international politics.  The complexities of the Cuban revolution are glossed over in favor of soap opera mechanics and corny melodramatics.  As ""Doctor Zhivago"" proved long ago (only better), there's nothing like a governmental overthrow to put a little sizzle into your love life.As noted earlier, Swayze stops by briefly to reprise his role as Johnny Castle, providing Katie with a few words of wisdom and encouragement and showing her a few nifty dance moves before sending her on her way.  I hope Swayze was paid well for his efforts, but it seems a bit demeaning for a star of Swayze's caliber to be treated in so ungrateful and cavalier a fashion.  The irony is that the film would have been far more interesting had it focused on Castle instead of Katie, but it's obvious that the studio executives who green lighted this project weren't about to bankroll a dance film with a middle-aged actor in the lead role.  That ""Shall We Dance?"" will wind up doing far better at the box office than ""Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights"" may provide some sweet vindication not only for Swayze but for all the fans of the original film for which this sequel was allegedly made.",2,sequel in name only,1098576000,"10 24, 2004",2004,2225,"['Patrick', 'Swayze', 'little', 'more', 'guest', 'appearance', 'Dirty', 'Dancing', 'Havana', 'Nights', 'misbegotten', 'sequel', '1987', 'box', 'office', 'smash', 'turned', 'actor', 'bona', 'fide', 'movie', 'star.This', 'time', 'focus', 'Katey', 'Miller', 'Romola', 'Garai', 'high', 'school', 'senior', 'who', 'family', 'Cuba', '1958', 'right', 'eve', 'Castro', 'revolution', 'there', 'being', 'white-bread', 'college-bound', 'bookworm', 'hot-blooded', 'Latin', 'dancer', 'tutelage', 'young', 'Cuban', 'Y', 'Tu', 'Mama', 'Tambien', 'Diego', 'Luna', 'who', 'poolside', 'hotel', 'where', 'many', 'other', 'Americans', 'live', 'Naturally', 'cavorting', 'dark-skinned', 'native', 'whole', 'host', 'hackles', 'snooty', 'foreigners', 'who', 'live', 'only', 'feed', 'off', 'sweat', 'hard', 'work', 'indigenous', 'population.Naturally', 'dancing', 'key', 'element', 'film', 'type', 'even', 'choreography', 'isn', 't', 'really', 'impressive', 'begin', 'ca', ""n't"", 'overcome', 'film', 'humdrum', 'storyline', 'shallow', 'characterizations', 'infantile', 'view', 'international', 'politics', 'complexities', 'Cuban', 'revolution', 'are', 'glossed', 'favor', 'soap', 'opera', 'mechanics', 'corny', 'melodramatics', 'Doctor', 'Zhivago', 'proved', 'long', 'ago', 'only', 'better', 'nothing', 'governmental', 'overthrow', 'put', 'little', 'sizzle', 'love', 'life.As', 'noted', 'earlier', 'Swayze', 'briefly', 'reprise', 'role', 'Johnny', 'Castle', 'providing', 'Katie', 'few', 'words', 'wisdom', 'encouragement', 'showing', 'few', 'nifty', 'dance', 'moves', 'sending', 'way', 'hope', 'Swayze', 'was', 'paid', 'well', 'efforts', 'bit', 'demeaning', 'star', 'Swayze', 'caliber', 'be', 'treated', 'so', 'ungrateful', 'cavalier', 'fashion', 'irony', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'had', 'focused', 'Castle', 'instead', 'Katie', 'obvious', 'studio', 'executives', 'who', 'green', 'lighted', 'project', 'were', ""n't"", 'about', 'bankroll', 'dance', 'film', 'middle-aged', 'actor', 'lead', 'role', 'Shall', 'Dance', 'will', 'wind', 'up', 'doing', 'far', 'better', 'box', 'office', 'Dirty', 'Dancing', 'Havana', 'Nights', 'may', 'provide', 'sweet', 'vindication', 'not', 'only', 'Swayze', 'fans', 'original', 'film', 'sequel', 'was', 'allegedly', 'made']",Dirty Dancing - Havana Nights
822545,AQM2ADBR0TYSO,B00023BLXK,Sarah Schenkkan,"[6, 7]","Set in the late 1950s against a lush Cuban backdrop, ""Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights"" follows the story of Katey, a young and socially awkward American who moves to Havana, which teeters on the edge of Castro's revolution. Amidst country clubs, pool-side cattiness from socialites, and adjusting to her new life, she meets Javier Suarez, a waiter with a passion for dancing and the sole responsibilty of providing for his large family. Immediately drawn to Javier and the world he represents, Katey persuades him to be her partner in the prestigious dance contest at the Palace Hotel. Soon, Katey visits the local club ""La Rosa Negra"" with him and experiences a side of life and herself that she has never seen before; stealing away day and night to explore both the city and the relationship that they begin to form. As their attraction builds and the contest nears, they both must overcome their fears to dance in the perfect sensual harmony, unknowing that a volcano of revolutionary violence on Havana's streets is about to erupt.As the fresh-faced Katey, Romola Garai (previously seen in the British hit ""I Capture The Castle"") brings innocense to the screen, as well as a hindered sensuality that she must discover. As young Javier, Diego Luna (most memorable in ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"") is a new, smoldering presence in film, with the perfect mix of sex appeal and a frivolous, almost childlike appearance. Although their characters suffer through some awkwardness due to corny bits in the script, Garai and Luna have remarkable chemistry on film.The backbone to this movie however, is the soundtrack and the dancing, both of which are truly spectacular. It is remarkable to note that neither Luna nor Garai had any dancing training before shooting, as their natural ease makes the choreography irresistable, sensual, and delicious to watch. The soundtrack, with sexy Cuban beats mixed with hip-hop from Wyclef Jean and Mya among others provide a toe-tapping setting, which enhances the experience for the audience.Although some moments are cliched, corny lines are delivered, and the plot can be predictable, ""Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights"" offers so much, that those things can easily be overlooked. From the chemistry onscreen, to the amazing dancing and soundtrack, and the costumes and sets, it creates an entire world of sensuality and personality, that it will delight every moveigoer.",5,"Steamy ""Dancing"" Heats Up Havana",1077926400,"02 28, 2004",2004,2392,"['Set', 'late', '1950s', 'lush', 'Cuban', 'backdrop', 'Dirty', 'Dancing', 'Havana', 'Nights', 'story', 'Katey', 'young', 'socially', 'awkward', 'American', 'who', 'Havana', 'edge', 'Castro', 'revolution', 'Amidst', 'country', 'clubs', 'pool-side', 'cattiness', 'socialites', 'adjusting', 'new', 'life', 'Javier', 'Suarez', 'waiter', 'passion', 'dancing', 'sole', 'responsibilty', 'providing', 'large', 'family', 'Immediately', 'drawn', 'Javier', 'world', 'Katey', 'be', 'partner', 'prestigious', 'dance', 'contest', 'Palace', 'Hotel', 'Soon', 'Katey', 'local', 'club', 'La', 'Rosa', 'Negra', 'side', 'life', 'never', 'seen', 'stealing', 'away', 'day', 'night', 'explore', 'city', 'relationship', 'begin', 'form', 'attraction', 'builds', 'contest', 'nears', 'must', 'overcome', 'fears', 'dance', 'perfect', 'sensual', 'harmony', 'unknowing', 'volcano', 'revolutionary', 'violence', 'Havana', 'streets', 'erupt.As', 'fresh-faced', 'Katey', 'Romola', 'Garai', 'previously', 'seen', 'British', 'hit', 'Capture', 'Castle', 'innocense', 'screen', 'as', 'well', 'hindered', 'sensuality', 'must', 'discover', 'young', 'Javier', 'Diego', 'Luna', 'most', 'memorable', 'Y', 'Tu', 'Mama', 'Tambien', 'new', 'smoldering', 'presence', 'film', 'perfect', 'mix', 'sex', 'appeal', 'frivolous', 'almost', 'childlike', 'appearance', 'characters', 'suffer', 'awkwardness', 'due', 'corny', 'bits', 'script', 'Garai', 'Luna', 'have', 'remarkable', 'chemistry', 'film.The', 'backbone', 'movie', 'however', 'soundtrack', 'dancing', 'are', 'truly', 'spectacular', 'remarkable', 'note', 'Luna', 'Garai', 'had', 'dancing', 'training', 'shooting', 'natural', 'ease', 'choreography', 'irresistable', 'sensual', 'delicious', 'watch', 'soundtrack', 'sexy', 'Cuban', 'beats', 'mixed', 'hip-hop', 'Wyclef', 'Jean', 'Mya', 'others', 'provide', 'toe-tapping', 'setting', 'experience', 'audience.Although', 'moments', 'are', 'cliched', 'corny', 'lines', 'are', 'delivered', 'plot', 'can', 'be', 'predictable', 'Dirty', 'Dancing', 'Havana', 'Nights', 'so', 'much', 'things', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'overlooked', 'chemistry', 'onscreen', 'amazing', 'dancing', 'soundtrack', 'costumes', 'sets', 'entire', 'world', 'sensuality', 'personality', 'will', 'delight', 'moveigoer']",Dirty Dancing - Havana Nights

I wasn't disappointed. I bought the movie right away afterwards and have watched it over and over. The music was great and Diego was absolutely delightful, what a sexy little bugger, who wouldn't want someone like that dancing you across the floor and anywhere else he wanted to take you. In the special features he talks about how excited he got when he finally learned the dance steps and you can see that joy all over his face in the one special scene.  For the most part the whole movie is great.  The ending is a little weak and that was the only disappointment.

822553,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00023BLXK,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 2]","I have nothing against the film's premise itself.  Really.  Romola Galai and Diego Luna make a charming couple in 'Dirty Dancing - Havana Nights' and they are fun to watch.  The corny dialogues and forgettable supports from Sela Ward, Mika Boorem, Jonathan Jackson, John Slattery and January Jones can be forgiven.  Even unnecessary cameo of the star of the original is OK to me.  But, no, what is this?  86 minutes?Again I say, I like the beautiful look of the film, but really hates the content which is too thin to make a feature film.  In other words, we need more romance and dancing.  However, the filmmakers foolishly -- yes, a strong word, but I insist --  foolishly inserted ""politics"" into the film which should be simple, unalloyed fun.Yes, politics, for the film is set in 1958.  Havana is going to see a revolution and Castro, but Americans are enjoying themselves in hotels, for whom the local Cubans are working hard.  As if to stress the historical fact and social background, rich father of our uptight American girl Katey (Galai who in fact is an English) is working for one of the biggest motor companies, and her friend January Jones literally despises a Cuban youth Javier (Luna who is in fact a Mexican).Someone please tell the producers that this kind of film doesn't need this complicated, politically conscious story.  All you need is an American girl who meets a boy in Cuba.  Period.  All you have to add is good music.  (Thankfully, the Cuban music here is irresitible, and it is always so.)But for all good soundtrack, the dancing scenes are less than satisfactory.  The dance sequences themselves are pretty good (though obviously the leads need more lesson), they are too short, and the final chapter that should be the rousing finale is interrupted by ... yes, politics, or the revolution.  Even the fans of Diego Luna, who must have given this film positive reviews, would agree with me.  Why should we be reminded of Castro reperatedly when we need more dancing?There are lots of films about dancing, and my favorite is Buz Luhrmann's 'Strictly Ballroom.'
