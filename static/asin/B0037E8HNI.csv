1329562,A2FPDWTD9AENVK,B0037E8HNI,Carl Manes,"[7, 10]","Despite Neil Marshall's departure from the director's chair, THE DESCENT editor Jon Harris manages to step in and provide all of the same great aesthetic, claustrophobia, and sheer terror that the 2005 surprise hit delivered four years earlier. PART 2 (as opposed to 2) becomes a powerful statement going in to the sequel, as this genuinely feels like the second half to THE DESCENT's whole.The action picks up immediately where the original left off, as Sarah returns to the remote caverns with a rescue team that has been assigned to locate the missing climbers after they failed to report back from their trip. Their mission brings them face to face with more subterranean terrors, as they must survive through cave-ins and the monsters hiding in the dark.Outside of Sarah's convenient memory loss and the obvious negligence in forcing an amnesiac into a search and rescue operation, the plot serves as an excellent approach in continuing the story. The filmmakers have set out to create a reversal of many of the essential themes driving the first film (loss of humanity, destruction of friendships, and others), which they have succeeded in in every way possible. PART 2 also earns a high level of legitimacy in the return of the entire original crew, as well as its two female leads in Shauna Macdonald and Natalie Mendoza. This is taken a step further in the reprisal of the original score and Neil Marshall's attachment as Executive Producer. Building on the continued theme of female empowerment, we also find that the men of THE DESCENT: PART 2 are weak, helpless, and impulsive, where the women remain strong, intuitive, and resourceful.While Harris does attempt to recreate many of the successful scares from Marshall's film, he has created a fresh palette of unique and perfectly crafted thrills that give his work a life of its own. Skeptical fans of THE DESCENT will be pleasantly surprised and shocked at many of the terrifying jumps the same way that they will enjoy the nauseating tension and suspense generated as the rescue workers squeeze through the impossibly tight passageways. The cave crawlers are just as fierce and menacing as they were before, but they still only pose half of the threat compared to the many cave-ins, dead ends, and suffocating quarters. Sarah's character arc is just as integral to the story of this second film as it had been previously, and Macdonald continues to shine in the role as she rebuilds much that was lost in her last cave dive. In addition, PART 2 packs on the gore in all the right places, without ever relying on it to mask any deficiencies in the plot.THE DESCENT: PART 2 may be one of the strongest series sequels to come out of the last decade, taking each of the successful elements of the original film and expanding them even further. It is that much more surprising that the film was not given a theatrical release, but it can expect to see a growing rise in interest on DVD.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",5,The Descent: Part 2,1277856000,"06 30, 2010",2010,2977,"['Neil', 'Marshall', 'departure', 'director', 'chair', 'THE', 'DESCENT', 'editor', 'Jon', 'Harris', 'step', 'provide', 'same', 'great', 'aesthetic', 'claustrophobia', 'sheer', 'terror', '2005', 'surprise', 'hit', 'delivered', 'four', 'years', 'earlier', 'PART', '2', 'opposed', '2', 'powerful', 'statement', 'going', 'sequel', 'genuinely', 'feels', 'second', 'half', 'DESCENT', 'whole.The', 'action', 'up', 'immediately', 'where', 'original', 'left', 'off', 'Sarah', 'remote', 'caverns', 'rescue', 'team', 'been', 'assigned', 'locate', 'missing', 'climbers', 'failed', 'report', 'back', 'trip', 'mission', 'face', 'face', 'more', 'subterranean', 'terrors', 'must', 'survive', 'cave-ins', 'monsters', 'hiding', 'dark.Outside', 'Sarah', 'convenient', 'memory', 'loss', 'obvious', 'negligence', 'forcing', 'amnesiac', 'search', 'rescue', 'operation', 'plot', 'excellent', 'approach', 'continuing', 'story', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'set', 'out', 'create', 'reversal', 'many', 'essential', 'themes', 'driving', 'first', 'film', 'loss', 'humanity', 'destruction', 'friendships', 'others', 'have', 'succeeded', 'way', 'possible', 'PART', '2', 'also', 'high', 'level', 'legitimacy', 'return', 'entire', 'original', 'crew', 'as', 'well', 'two', 'female', 'leads', 'Shauna', 'Macdonald', 'Natalie', 'Mendoza', 'taken', 'step', 'further', 'reprisal', 'original', 'score', 'Neil', 'Marshall', 'attachment', 'Executive', 'Producer', 'Building', 'continued', 'theme', 'female', 'empowerment', 'also', 'find', 'men', 'DESCENT', 'PART', '2', 'are', 'weak', 'helpless', 'impulsive', 'where', 'women', 'remain', 'strong', 'intuitive', 'resourceful.While', 'Harris', 'attempt', 'recreate', 'many', 'successful', 'scares', 'Marshall', 'film', 'created', 'fresh', 'palette', 'unique', 'perfectly', 'crafted', 'thrills', 'give', 'work', 'life', 'own', 'Skeptical', 'fans', 'THE', 'DESCENT', 'will', 'be', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'shocked', 'many', 'terrifying', 'same', 'way', 'will', 'enjoy', 'nauseating', 'tension', 'suspense', 'generated', 'rescue', 'workers', 'squeeze', 'impossibly', 'tight', 'passageways', 'cave', 'crawlers', 'are', 'just', 'fierce', 'menacing', 'were', 'before', 'still', 'only', 'pose', 'half', 'threat', 'compared', 'many', 'cave-ins', 'dead', 'ends', 'suffocating', 'quarters', 'Sarah', 'character', 'arc', 'just', 'as', 'integral', 'story', 'second', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'previously', 'Macdonald', 'shine', 'role', 'much', 'was', 'lost', 'last', 'cave', 'dive', 'addition', 'PART', '2', 'packs', 'gore', 'right', 'places', 'ever', 'relying', 'mask', 'deficiencies', 'plot.THE', 'DESCENT', '2', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'strongest', 'series', 'sequels', 'come', 'last', 'decade', 'taking', 'successful', 'elements', 'original', 'film', 'expanding', 'even', 'further', 'much', 'more', 'surprising', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'given', 'theatrical', 'release', 'can', 'expect', 'see', 'growing', 'rise', 'interest', 'DVD.-Carl', 'ManesI', 'Horror', 'Movies']",N/A

Yes, hes is old school horror and he can get a bit predictable, but overall his films are original in their own way. This one...is not. It didnt need to be made, but coming off the HUGE buzz and money the first one created, one can expect hollywood to plop a sequel in our laps and expect us to eat it as a dessert after the amazing first course. Warning, it will give you indigestion and not in a ""wow that was gorey scary!"" kind of way, more like the ""I am sad someone had to get up in the morning and film this"" kind of way.This begins basically at the end of the first film, and now our girl sarah who just survived a hellish creature filled massacre of her friends is in the hospital and the local sheriff and his band of cave explorers are looking for the rest of her party. Somehow they get her to go back in there with them, they tried to make it seem as if she didnt friggin remember what happened and so yeah...she goes with them willingly. I had a hard time buying that hole in the plot. I understand Post traumatic stress induced memory loss, but to use that as a carrier to get her back in? just sad, and boring, and sad again.We all know what is down there, what is gonna happen, we know at this point that the creatures who are blind but can hear awesomely will hone in on this group and clickity clack and climb the walls and then pounce and tear open throats.

1329567,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B0037E8HNI,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[1, 2]","I put off watching this movie for a long time.  The Descent was so freaking awesome, I wanted to remember the story and the experience as it truly was - claustrophobic, harrowing, emotional, and thoroughly complete in and of itself.  A sequel, I feared, could only take something away from all that; there was certainly no way it could possibly live up to the original - if for no other reason that we already know what lives down there in those caves.  I was right all along, of course, and I must say I truly wish this sequel had never been made.  It fails to recapture the agonizing atmosphere and suspense of the original, offers little in the way of characterization and emotional intensity (something the original did exceedingly well), and changes the story in ways I dislike and find a hard time accepting.  On its own merits, it's a pretty darn good movie, much better than most of the dreck coming out of Hollywood, but in the bigger picture, The Descent Part 2 is more about cashing in than improving the story, and I choose to remember The Descent without its unwelcome addition.  I realize I may be more passionate about the original than most fans, so I'm certainly not recommending you skip this movie altogether or suggesting that you will hate it.  Just don't expect it to live up to the original - and, for heaven's sake, don't watch it without seeing the original first.Nullifying the rather ambiguous ending of the original US version (and completely contradicting the end of the British version), The Descent Part 2 opens with Sarah Carter (Shauna Macdonald) having emerged from the cave system and being rescued.  She's not badly hurt, but she has no memory of what happened to her and her friends.  Well, that's just not good enough for Sheriff Vaines (Gavan O'Herlihy), who has Sarah dragged out of her hospital bed to accompany a small team of rescue workers right back where she just came from.  Naturally, this includes a rather stereotypical couple of young people who are apparently attracted to one another, along with the sheriff and deputy Ellen Rios (Krysten Cummings).  Why a fat and annoying sheriff and his female deputy, neither of whom have the least bit of spelunking experience, should be part of the rescue team is beyond me.  Well, they all get down there and guess what happens?  Crawlers.  It's just like the first movie, except you don't really know or care that much about most of the characters, they all have next to none of the fighting and survival instincts of the girls they're searching for, and the whole experience is never that uncomfortable to watch.  The original movie had scenes that had my claustrophobia kicking in at nearly maximum levels, but this sequel never even got me squirming.  Naturally, the crawlers held no suspense because I already knew they were there and what they were all about.I will say this for The Descent Part 2 - it does deliver a couple of surprises (the merits of which are open for debate), one of which I never saw coming.  Apart from this, though, there isn't a whole lot of story here.  It's really just a matter of director Jon Harris and the writers trying to deliver more blood and gore than the first movie.  Unfortunately, it was not the blood and gore that made the original so special - it was Neil Marshall's inspired character-based writing and direction.

1329568,A1FJ4WAOIDPEF4,B0037E8HNI,David J. Brown,"[1, 3]","Okay, right off the top, I have to clear up two things really quick:1).This film itself is only about two stars, maybe two and half. BUT there are some great things in it that brings it up to a solid three with reservations. Plus, the DVD has some neat and informative special features.2). There's been much confusion on this site and elsewhere on whether this sequel picks up after the ending of the director's original and the only version in Europe ending, or the truncated American release ending. Well, it's a sequel to the Unrated/director's cut/European version of the original film. Firstly, the director of this sequel states that even didn't even know there was an alternate version on the American release. He's then told what the version was and laughs, because, to him, it would seem obvious as the sequel's narrative unfolds that they just find Sarah Carter shambling along the highway after climbing her way out of the cave. If it was a sequel to the American version then why would she be wondering on the highway? The way the American version ends she has a vehicle and has escaped.....SO, lets end that debate right there.Anyway, either way the fact that Sarah managed to find her way out, which this sequel conveniently never dramatizes or really explains, makes what damages this sequel the most, its first act, even more hard to swallow. We last saw Sarah, at the end of The Descent, fantasizing about escape and then coming back to reality, accepting her fate and spending some R&R; time with an imagined image of her dead daughter. It was a stark and unforgiving ending to a horror tale. In this film she is picked up on the side of the road manic and muddy. She's brough to the hospital and interviewed by the very curious police. Where's her friends? Why doesn't she remember anything? Did she kill them and leave them in the caves? Could these creatures she described really be down there? Yeah, as I mentioned Sarah has also lost her memory....RIGHT! I hate when movies, sequel or otherwise, use this cheesy plot device to push their narrative along. It's so false, and so obviously in there to give the character an excuse to willingly go back to the place she spent the whole last film trying to escape. Oh, and then of course the lead detective wants Sarah to accompany him and a new cave team to go inspect the cave, see if there's any survivors, and jog Sarah's memory. Yeah. Right. This plot device barely held together in James Cameron's Aliens, and it's WAY less effective and believable here. The whole first act of this film is a slog, testing the viewers' patience and ability to suspend disbelief.Fortunately, once our new crew of doomed cave divers gets into said cave the film gets good, really good. It's so well done, frightening and frenetic one wishes the set up had been more clever or at least more believable. The director, Jon Harris, who also was the editor of the first film gets great moments of suspense and carnage once in the cave. It's at least as well done as Neil Marshall's stuff in the original film. The creatures are just as ferocious and hungry. The story even throws in two more kinks and surprises, although I'm sure most reviews here have ruined them, I will not mention them. The photography and pace are well done. The shocks come one on top of the other until the gut wrenching finale. Unfortunately, the film basically ends where the first one did, but there's a twist in the prologue. A twist that doesn't really make much sense. I'm sure a viewer could deduct their own reasoning behind what and why just happened before the end credits, and that's fine, but totally unnecessary. It's either really lame sequel bait or a very uncreative way to end your film on a twist. YOu decide. The writing in this last sequence seems to revert to the crappiness it was in the first act. It's like someone else wrote the good stuff that makes up the middle and the top parts of the third act.First, the Blu Ray. It's a region free disc, but your firmware has to have the most recent updates for it to play. It has no special features, which is weird because this was a British film, and is being released by Icon Home Entertainment(Mel Gibson's company) through it's horror and cult film subdivision Insomnia. The picture and sound is pristine. Really worth it for this film. Having the DVD also, I was impressed how great this grimy little horror film looks on Blu Ray, just like the first film.The DVD. The DVD, doesn't have the great sound and picture of the Blu ray, but it's not bad. The sound is almost as good, and the picture is just fine when upcomverted on a hi def player. It's the special features on this thing that really make it worth a try. The commentary track with director Jon Harris, and actors Shauna MaDonald(love her, wish she was a bigger star), Krysten Cummings and Anna Skllern is a total joy. This shoot sounds like it was a ton of fun. There's lots of info regarding how things were done and what was left out. You also get the what version is this a sequel put to bed in a funny way on this track. There's several deleted scenes that are mostly forgettable and deal with the horrendous first act. A little bit more creature violence but really only snippets. Finally, we get a making of featurette: Deeper and Darker, that is informative, but really repeats a lot of the info seen from the first film's making of materials. It's entertaining and interesting but this sequel and the original seem to have been made the same way.The middle section of this film really had me on the edge of my seat, and I smiled as I was being jolted. It's so effective that I gave this film an undeserved third star. The director is so good at pacing, shot progression, the actor's so convincing, and the creatures so cool, that it's a damn shame that better screenwriters couldn't have been employed to surround the cave action with a convincing and less cliche'd narrative. The opening set up scenes are so bad and lame that you'll have to punch yourself in the face to prevent your eyes from rolling. The director, effect men, and actors make this film bareable. They should all do another film, even a sequel to this, with new writers and I would be down.PS: There's a scene that reference the blood pool sequence from the first film, but this time our heroine finds herself in a pool of feces and creature waste. It's really gross, and ends with a button that is truly goofy, but not out of character with the events considering the reality of the premise. I'll be damned but I squirmed and then laughed. I know most seem to hate this scene, but I really liked it.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------",3,Review of DVD and European Blu Ray.,1304294400,"05 2,

1329583,AXSCVTO7K9XZL,B0037E8HNI,I Like Cheese,"[9, 13]","I had quite high hopes for The Descent - Part 2 asThe Descent (Original Unrated Cut) [Widescreen Edition] was one of the most claustrophobic and terrifying films that I can remember from recent years. It continues just minutes after the first film and a rescue crew are ready to find any possible survivors from the caving expedition that went horrifically wrong. The sole survivor, Sarah, is discovered but is suffering from severe psychological trauma and is therefore unable to speak or remember what happened..She accompanies the rescue team back to the cave she has just emerged from, but the creatures that live down there are hungry once again.After a very slow and unexciting start, the last half an hour or so is very tense and again, very claustrophobic, so it did satisfy me with regards to sticking fairly close to the original's winning formula. Unfortunately where this film failed though was that we'd been there before and seen what is down there, so the whole unknown territory and unexpected horrors that made the first film so shocking was taken away somewhat as there was no real surprises or twists that I didn't see coming. Another thing that made me knock a few stars off (like with many horror sequels) is that the characters from the previous film now appear to be experts on the monsters, even though they had only been in their presence for a few minutes previously and only a day has supposed to have passed. Juno's characters was particularly bad to the point where I actually laughed out loud as she is become some Lara Croft-like action hero overnight, removing a lot of the realism the original had. The monsters are seen a lot more too and are the main focus of the storyline, rather than it being more about surviving in the caves. The ending annoyed me a lot too as it was how it ended was completely unnecessary didn't really make much sense.I know this sounds like more of a rant than a review, but I think I'm just disappointed at how this is has turned into a fairly generic horror film, which is a shame as the first film felt so original and set a new standard, whereas this is nothing different from any other monster movie really.

1329584,A1HMBIRR0RJ1NI,B0037E8HNI,JAMES MCCORMICK,"[1, 1]","""The Descent: Part 2"" is aptly named. It is a descent from the original in terms of over all quality, & non-alignment of the story from the first movie.Sarah in the original film (American version), escaped through a hole in the ground from a mountain side. In the sequel, they more or less threw that out, & pointed towards her escaping from a mining shaft. There were actions in the cave that Sarah said she did in the first movie that were not a part of the first film. Though to be fair, the camera was not on Sarah all the time in the first film. There were other tidbits here & there that did not jive with the first film too, minor, but never the less, not in tune with the first film. The cave dwellers also looked different from the first movie, while still convincing, they were a notch down from the original. I more or less credit this to lack of budget.There is a lot of action in this sequel, many fight scenes, but they are no where as well choreographed & seemed in general much quicker, less intense in nature, though the gore level is higher, it adds nothing to the film. The acting, script, plot, & editing is no where close to the original either. Many of the characters just seemed to be cast in this movie for cave mutant bait, no real character development. Sherriff Vaines character was the typical stereotype of a dumb redneck cop. His character brought nothing to this film, other than stupidity.I really wish I could say there were redeeming factors in this film that pushed it close to the level of the first film. The only scene I can think of is the last ten minutes in the cave when three characters are near the surface & trying to escape. This is the only scene that is on level with the original. There also is a good plot twist two thirds into the film, but I won't say what that is. The ending was surprising, but on second viewing, it was more or less a cheat.For all it's short comings, ""the Descent: Part 2"" is still worth seeing, it does have it's moments, but be forewarned, if you've seen the original, keep your expectations in descent.3 Stars = Good",3,A True Descent From the Original,1318550400,"10 14, 2011",2011,2093,"['Descent', 'Part', '2', 'aptly', 'named', 'descent', 'original', 'terms', 'quality', 'non-alignment', 'story', 'first', 'movie.Sarah', 'original', 'film', 'American', 'version', 'escaped', 'hole', 'ground', 'mountain', 'side', 'sequel', 'more', 'less', 'out', 'pointed', 'escaping', 'mining', 'shaft', 'were', 'actions', 'cave', 'Sarah', 'said', 'did', 'first', 'movie', 'were', 'not', 'part', 'first', 'film', 'be', 'fair', 'camera', 'was', 'not', 'Sarah', 'time', 'first', 'film', 'were', 'other', 'tidbits', 'here', 'there', 'did', 'not', 'jive', 'first', 'film', 'too', 'minor', 'never', 'less', 'not', 'tune', 'first', 'film', 'cave', 'dwellers', 'also', 'looked', 'different', 'first', 'movie', 'still', 'convincing', 'were', 'notch', 'down', 'original', 'more', 'less', 'credit', 'lack', 'budget.There', 'lot', 'action', 'sequel', 'many', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'where', 'as', 'well', 'choreographed', 'seemed', 'general', 'much', 'quicker', 'less', 'intense', 'nature', 'gore', 'level', 'higher', 'nothing', 'film', 'acting', 'script', 'plot', 'editing', 'where', 'close', 'original', 'Many', 'characters', 'just', 'seemed', 'be', 'cast', 'movie', 'cave', 'mutant', 'bait', 'real', 'character', 'development', 'Sherriff', 'Vaines', 'character', 'was', 'typical', 'stereotype', 'dumb', 'redneck', 'cop', 'character', 'brought', 'nothing', 'film', 'other', 'stupidity.I', 'really', 'wish', 'could', 'say', 'were', 'redeeming', 'factors', 'film', 'pushed', 'close', 'level', 'first', 'film', 'only', 'scene', 'can', 'think', 'last', 'ten', 'minutes', 'cave', 'when', 'three', 'characters', 'are', 'surface', 'trying', 'escape', 'only', 'scene', 'level', 'original', 'also', 'good', 'plot', 'twist', 'two', 'thirds', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'what', 'ending', 'was', 'surprising', 'second', 'viewing', 'was', 'more', 'less', 'cheat.For', 'short', 'comings', 'Descent', 'Part', '2', 'still', 'worth', 'seeing', 'have', 'moments', 'be', 'forewarned', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'original', 'keep', 'expectations', 'descent.3', 'Stars', '=', 'Good']",N/A

When I heard they were doing a sequel I was all about it! I know people bash sequels but I like it when they tie up loose ends and I, unlike many horror fans, am more forgiving of sequels. I take them as they are and just go by what I enjoy and dont tear it down before they see it or get to overly critical. Just me. In saying all that, this movie was great but it wasnt bad. It didnt have the same terror the first one had but I think that would be hard to do since we kinda know what the crawlers look like and all. It was nice that they picked up right where the first one left off and you got to see what happened to Juno and in the end, it kinda wraps some things up. Does kinda leave the end as if another movie was possible but it was still done fairly well. The crawlers are a bit different but that didnt bother. The only thing that bothered me and this was just cause I am scared of water and all. There's a part in the second one where they come across the body of Sam, the girl who was killed while suspended in mid air. Now someone falls down the chasm and it seems like they just fall and die but in the first one, there is a large body of water under it (Juno fell in it in the first one) but it seems like they missed that.

Instead of echoing the first film's moral of betrayal, it's a story of redemption. The two key figures from the first film meet again and must forgive and save each other, and work together to save an innocent. If you're guessing that this used car runs on what gas and residual fumes are left in the tank, you're right.Five women missing and only one found, covered in blood -- that's the starting point. Well, the police improbably decide to drag that woman, nearly catatonic with shock, out of her hospital bed and back below ground. Down into the caves they go. One by one the search party is devoured, and there are some good sequences -- a girl gets across a crevasse by jumping onto the swinging corpse of her friend. Blood spills over her face as she hangs and swings, slippery and scared. Two girls wind up in a pool of poo, the critters' communal toilet. One girl, our original survivor, is handcuffed to an overweight sheriff, and you can guess how that could easily be her...well, downfall. But there's not enough here to overlook the glaring deficiency of character development. Who are the people in this new party? We don't learn much, so it's hard to care what happens to them. This would have been easy to fix, with a few establishing scenes to open the film. But all we learn, really, is that our latest heroine is a young Latina deputy who just wants to make it home to her family. Will she? At the time this sequel was made, there were plans for another film, and she was to be in both. Low box office likely nixed that plan.The original Descent is an edge-of-your-seat gorefest thriller, with a moral component which gives it resonance. This sequel is unremarkable. Less atmospheric than the original, with far less character development, but still better than so many sequels. A mostly respectable effort, not fully successful but interesting.

The fear factor of The Descent stemmed from hearing sounds, but not seeing what sort of creature was making it. In this film, it takes maybe thirty minutes to see the first creature on screen. This is actually addressed in the commentary and the studio pressed the director to get to the caves within a short period of time. The studio was right in not wanting to postpone off the inevitable since the audience knows what is going to happen. Rescuers are going to head into the caves and get chopped up by monsters. Since all of the mystery has been stripped away, we're left with a straight ahead monster movie. I relate this film to Jaws 2, a sequel that in no way could have lived up to its predecessor, but was leagues better than anyone was expecting.

Many times I find I like it, perhaps partly because I went in with low expectations.  The reverse is often true.  I hear great things; see it and I'm disappointed expecting more.  An example of this is `There Will Be Blood'.  It was critically acclaimed yet I did not like it at all.  `The Descent 2' is a case where I heard mixed comments on the film went in with low expectations and was rewarded with a lousy movie.  I admit it did have its occasional moments of genuine chills and there was a while there where I thought it was a worthy sequel.  That was till about the half way mark.  Unfortunately much of the second half of the story was a dragged out gory excuse to knock everyone off one by one.  Once again stupid people in a horror film doing really dumb things.  It was finally to the point where I was starting to root for the monsters.  Then I was angered that they went through the trouble of bringing back two characters, Sarah and Juno from `The Descent' that I liked.  I especially liked Juno.  She was a tough Ripley like character.  These two by all logic should have been dead in the first story considering what happened to them.  Juno's surprise appearance late in the film was nice...for a while.  What a woman!  She managed to stay alive down there all that time and even seemed to be healing. In the first film it was revealed that Juno had an affair with Sarah's husband.  Sarah left Juno to die in those caves, sort of.  In this film the two women eventually come to terms with that all somehow. They throw in the new character of a policewoman who, along with a team, sets out to rescue the women from the first film.  Sarah had escaped yet cannot remember what happened to the others, so the rescue team drags her back down into the cavern with them to find out.  The authorities dragging a wounded mentally unstable woman back underground is wrong in so many ways, I wouldn't know where to begin.  Later the policewoman wants to get back to her little girl. She even leaves a heart breaking video on her cell phone when she doesn't think she will escape.  She's told by Sarah, who was thoughtfully listening, that they are not dead yet and to save those words to say to the girl in person.  Sarah had lost her own daughter a year or so earlier and seemed determined to get this woman back to her daughter.  At least this gave some direction to drive the story.  In the last minutes right as escape and blessed sunlight are a few yards way Sarah and Juno, are stupidly killed off fighting the creatures.  At first we think to ourselves their sacrifice was for a greater good, to die so that the policewoman can return to her little girl. And that gave their deaths some meaning.  But noooooo, instead the jerks who made this thing had other plans.  They made it look like the mother was escaped, then instead had some redneck nut, obviously in cahoots with the underground dwellers, whack her in the head with a shovel.  He then drags her back to the mouth of the opening she had just escaped from to be eaten by the creatures.  So in the end everyone is dead, and the sacrifices made from the women carried over from the first story, Sarah and Juno, were wasted and so was my time.

The 2005 horror opus from Neil Marshall (who serves as an executive producer here instead of writer/director) remains one of the absolute best and most terrifying horror films to be released in the past decade, which is one reason why a sequel not helmed by Marshall rang all sorts of alarms in me upon first hearing about it.  However, The Descent: Part 2 winds up not being terrible in the least, and in its own right is a frequently scary and compelling film, but it just can't live up to the surprisingly lofty heights that the first film grasped.  Shauna Macdonald returns as Sarah, as the film picks up right where the first one left off.  Upon her discovery, she is forced to accompany a group of rescuers into the caves that she escaped, with some grisly and bloody results.  While there is a good amount of gore, shocks, and solid scares, what The Descent: Part 2 lacks is the kind of character and overall story development that helped make the first film so compelling.  Not to mention the fact that there is a good degree of events that happen here that betray what happened in the first film, and an ending that manages to be both shocking and a bit confusing.

1329622,A329U9CDUPKXAC,B0037E8HNI,Patrick,"[0, 0]","The first Descent movie was fantastic. I think the reason why so many people enjoyed it was because it had a sense of realism to it. Take a group of friends, send them into a dark cave, bad things happen. In that movie, it was so dark that you sort of felt trapped in the cave with them. And because of that sense of realism, you didn't really want to see any of the characters die. Now we have Descent 2 and there are 3 new characters that you really don't care if they die and one character that you want to die because he's so annoying. By having expendable characters like this, it cheapens the movie. Also, for a cave that is deep below ground, there sure is a lot of sunlight coming in. The characters act like they need flashlights but even with the lights turns off you can see everything plain as day. This hurts the movie TREMENDOUSLY!!! I can forgive the weak storyline to a certain degree but they pretty much killed what made the first movie so great by having the cave lit up the way they did. There is also a really strange ending that made no sense. Probably a set up for a Descent 3. I hope it doesn't  happen. It would only be worse than this one. There are some things I liked.

1329628,A39W3263A9HCMN,B0037E8HNI,"Renfield ""Up the Irons""","[7, 14]","I saw this movie recently after I stumbled upon a torrent of it. The fact that it's not getting a theatrical release is bad enough, to make matters worse I'd have had to wait until it gets released on Blu-Ray. So after the torrent took two days of downloading, I finally got around to watching it. Now before I begin, let me make a comparison here.In my review of the first movie, I titled the movie ""amazing"". Now when I heard there would be a second one, I got incredibly excited for it and couldn't wait. So I waited and waited, and when it came out in the UK, I had heard from an Irish buddy that it was a terrible movie. I thought, ""Geez he can't be serious."" Well, having seen it, it turns out that he was being generous.I had also read reviews before the movie got released, positive ones, and all of them said something to the effect of ""Be kind on the director who made it; it was his first movie, obviously he isn't that experienced in the directing world"", and those comments seemed suspicious. Well I had every reason to be suspicious of those comments after reading them- they're simply over-apologetic. Just because a movie is a director's first doesn't mean I will excuse it- it depends on the quality. Plus also judging a person's first film by saying ""be kind because it's his first"" is total BS. There have been several amazing directorial debuts. Eraserhead, Sin Nombre, Whip It, I can name a few.Almost nothing works in this movie. To say the plot is almost fanfiction level is an understatement; to say it is ridiculous is more like it. Basically Sarah has escaped the cave after seeming to be trapped down there forever at the end of the first movie, and is treated at the hospital. She apparently doesn't remember what happened and because of it, has to return to the cave with a search party to locate the bodies of her team when, well, the first movie happens again.Trust me guys, while the plot might not read like a bad fanfiction from my description, it does in the movie. Another thing the movie is guilty of is pretending the first movie didn't happen. Well, it did. We were there when it did. We saw it. Almost the exactly same things happen. The characters in this movie are embarassingly cliche and nowhere near as charming as the ones in the first movie. What's the biggest disappointment is the return of Juno. WHAT a wasted opportunity! I was excited because she was the best in the first movie. But no, she was almost a female John McClane on steroids in this movie, and it was just embarrassing. And the sexy  Natalie Mendoza's performance was horrible too.The scary scenes/crawlie bits sucked too. It seemed that Jon went to some idiot: ""OK, so yeah. Just move the camera in very close, shake it out of oblivion, have people randomly scream, splash water randomly, throw fake blood everywhere and just have the actors jump around randomly!"" ""Cool!!!! I can not understand what's going on! It MUST be great!!!!!"" Ugh. The gore looked like Clamato juice and nowhere near as impressive as in the first movie, it looked very watery as well. It almost reminded me of A Clockwork Orange how the blood all over Alex in the interrogation room looked overly orange. Worst of all, the crawlies looked hilariously nothing like the first movie, and like something in Peter Jackson's Dead-Alive. This trilogy is going to be like the Robocop trilogy- How the first movie is great and sets the standards, the second movie messes everything up and brings in dumb and unnecessary things, and the third tries to make everything all big and epic and yet just flushes itself down the toilet and process.In short, I was really looking forward to this movie, and wound up being disappointed.

The Descent 2 just tries to milk the concept for another movie.  Well if you have seen the first movie then you know there were two different endings, a dark ending with the main character not escaping and the U.S. version which had the girl escape.  This movie uses the U.S. ending and picks right up with the girl escaping and being rescued.  But the local law enforcement wants to know what happened to the other girls and our heroin from the first movie is in shock and not talking.  So of course they would drag an injured half catatonic girl back down to the caves with only a handful of people and have no one waiting at the surface in constant communication.  The movie has such flawed logic that it really kills the picture.  Another big problem is the creatures.  You constantly see the creatures now, so the mystery and the scares from the first are gone.

The movie is one of my favorite horror films of recent times. When I heard a second installment was being made, I felt bittersweet about it. I went into the film both excited and apprehensive because in most cases, sequels rarely come close to being as effective as the original. THIS however is not the case for The Descent: Part 2!One of the most common questions about this film is ""Why would the lead character, Sarah, go back down into the cave after barely making it out alive in the first place?"" and that question is answered very well and makes perfect sense when you watch the film. The story line and atmosphere, while very similar to the first, are still VERY effective.

Indeed it was.The Descent was masterfully done: If you're like me, you didn't read what The Descent was about before going into it; you only knew that it was some kind of Horror movie. It starts out as a seemingly innocent bunch of girls off on a spelunking trip. Marshall expertly leads you into the caves with the group of girls with an impending sense of doom. And when doom arrives it's wickedly creepy. Who will ever forget when that gal looked down the narrow corridor of that cave to see a ghostly humanoid creature staring back at her?The Descent 2 picks up where The Descent leaves off, but where The Descent excelled in building up to a scary well executed Horror film, The Descent 2 fails. The Descent 2 is basically a complete redo--a bad remake--of The Descent. The Descent 2 is as predictable as they come.In The Descent 2 the search is on for the group of gals from The Descent 1, complete with a bumbling local sheriff. And when I say bumbling, I mean the acting was so bad that it made most clich&eacute; bumbling movie sheriffs look smart. Our bumbling sheriff learns that one of the original gals has emerged from the caves, so instead of alerting the search and rescue specialists that he is currently searching with, he suggests to his local deputies that they keep it quiet. The gal that emerges is Shauna MacDonald from the first movie, who has lost all memory of the terrifying events of what happened in her debut ""Descent"". Convenient.So even though the bumbling sheriff suspects Shauna of some violent foul play against her former spelunkers, he decides that the best course of action is to bring Shauna back into the caves to further search for the rest of her party from the first movie... without any professional climbers, spelunkers or other believable actions.  What results is a hokey movie of jump out of the dark scares and gross outs. The Descent 2 often mimics scenes and situations first seen in the original, but never comes even close to the suspenseful, well-told story that Marshall crafted in the original.So my advice is to see the original movie if you have not already; it's really good.

Randall ""WildHorseWoman""","[0, 1]","I had seen the first Descent before and actually watched it again just prior to seeing part 2; so I was set up and ready for the follow-through.  I was really okay with it, I knew that it would be a slow slaughter one at a time (usually) of those who didn't know what they were getting into.  Sarah is forced back underground by a Sheriff who thinks she could have harmed the group single-handedly, (she's covered in blood) she is also suffering from amnesia; a point he ignores.  They are looking for Juno, now a Senators niece which is to justify the news media and pressure on the Sheriff to DO SOMETHING NOW.So the blood fest begins shortly after they go down into a mine shaft that leads (conveniently) to the cave system the girls are thought to be lost in.  One old, former miner tells them about when they found the caves; his grandfather went to investigate and never came back. People never listen.Now we have a 3 member, experienced cave SAR team, the Sheriff(stereotyped Southerner shame on them) and his black female deputy, smart, capable and totally sympathetic to Sarah.  The Sheriff is a jackass who won't leave his gun topside; but they needed that ruse to set up the cave-in that traps them in with the creepers.  So we're basically back to the Descent 1...less hormones more testosterone(which is NEVER a good thing.As I said, now the slaughter begins, and it's more splatter, more gross in-your-face gore than the first movie and that IMHO isn't really necessary.  But, if that's your thing you won't be disappointed.  I did appreciate that it fully showed we girls can kick some serious tail when push comes to shove.  No simpering whining females here.  The action is fast paced, with a few surprises and the same gut-wrenching, claustrophobic buried alive moments that tightens the sphincters on normal folks. (No spelunker here!)  Then we're down to three and I won't tell you who and it's full on human v creepers war at the escape hole and only one is getting out.Now, my biggest problem with this movie is the ending.  I won't spoil it, but I hated it.  I know some would deride me for wanting a 'happy ending', well how could it be happy when all these people died?  I don't know, but like some movies it's just better to stop it before that final scene, and for that final scene I took off a star and a half.",2,No reason for the final scene.,1358035200,"01 13, 2013",2013,2338,"['had', 'seen', 'first', 'Descent', 'actually', 'watched', 'again', 'just', 'prior', 'seeing', 'part', '2', 'so', 'was', 'set', 'up', 'ready', 'follow-through', 'was', 'really', 'okay', 'knew', 'would', 'be', 'slow', 'slaughter', 'one', 'time', 'usually', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'were', 'getting', 'Sarah', 'forced', 'back', 'underground', 'Sheriff', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'harmed', 'group', 'single-handedly', 'covered', 'blood', 'also', 'suffering', 'amnesia', 'point', 'are', 'looking', 'Juno', 'now', 'Senators', 'niece', 'justify', 'news', 'media', 'pressure', 'Sheriff', 'DO', 'SOMETHING', 'NOW.So', 'blood', 'fest', 'shortly', 'go', 'down', 'mine', 'shaft', 'conveniently', 'cave', 'system', 'girls', 'are', 'thought', 'be', 'lost', 'One', 'old', 'former', 'miner', 'when', 'found', 'caves', 'grandfather', 'went', 'investigate', 'never', 'came', 'back', 'People', 'never', 'listen.Now', 'have', '3', 'member', 'experienced', 'cave', 'SAR', 'team', 'Sheriff', 'stereotyped', 'Southerner', 'shame', 'black', 'female', 'deputy', 'smart', 'capable', 'totally', 'sympathetic', 'Sarah', 'Sheriff', 'jackass', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'leave', 'gun', 'topside', 'needed', 'ruse', 'set', 'up', 'cave-in', 'creepers', ""'re"", 'basically', 'back', 'Descent', '1', 'less', 'hormones', 'more', 'testosterone', 'NEVER', 'good', 'thing.As', 'said', 'now', 'slaughter', 'more', 'splatter', 'more', 'gross', 'in-your-face', 'gore', 'first', 'movie', 'IMHO', ""n't"", 'really', 'necessary', 'thing', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'did', 'appreciate', 'fully', 'showed', 'girls', 'can', 'kick', 'serious', 'tail', 'when', 'push', 'shove', 'simpering', 'whining', 'females', 'here', 'action', 'fast', 'paced', 'few', 'surprises', 'same', 'gut-wrenching', 'claustrophobic', 'buried', 'alive', 'moments', 'sphincters', 'normal', 'folks', 'spelunker', 'here', 'Then', ""'re"", 'down', 'three', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'who', 'full', 'human', 'v', 'creepers', 'war', 'escape', 'hole', 'only', 'one', 'getting', 'out.Now', 'biggest', 'problem', 'movie', 'ending', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'hated', 'know', 'would', 'deride', 'wanting', ""'happy"", 'ending', 'well', 'how', 'could', 'be', 'happy', 'when', 'people', 'died', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'movies', 'just', 'better', 'stop', 'final', 'scene', 'final', 'scene', 'took', 'off', 'star', 'half']",N/A
1329640,A3DV7AKNM4N8TN,B0037E8HNI,Stuart Conover,"[0, 0]","The Descent Part 2 is the direct to DVD sequel of The Descent, one of my favorite horror films of all time. Going direct to DVD usually means I have to be nothing but worried but in fact, much like Cabin Fever 2, ended up being fun. It is the directorial debut of Jon Harris (who was involved in editing the original The Descent) with the screen play written by not 1, not 2, but 3 authors - J Blakeson, James McCarthy, and James Watkins. While all three of these writers don't have an overly extensive history what they were able to put together here should change that in the near future.The sequel begins exactly how a sequel should - directly after the first film ended. I was rather worried how casting would be (I had done 0 research ahead of time) and we are treated to having the return of Shauna Macdonald as Sarah, the woman brutally traumatized in the first film. She has no memory of what happened to her or her friends but with the media having a field day trying to find them the local sheriff has decided that she is the only hope on finding them so brings her out with him when he attempts to explore a cave that they believe may lead them to the other women. He also is suspect of her as she was covered in blood that was not her own. While I was a bit annoyed with the temporary amnesia she experiences at the beginning of the film it both doesn't last long and was realistically the only way they could explain away how she is willing to go back in to look for her friends.When her memory does come back she has no motivation aside from escaping the mines but at this moment we are conveniently the Sheriff (who we are clearly setup to hate from the offset) accidentally cause a cave in trapping them all below. While their safe way out has been removed they can only move in further to hopefully leave from another exit and are quick to stumble across the mutants from the first film that are more vicious than they were previously. (If you were on a rescue team wouldn't you have other people know exactly where you were?) As we know what they are now to an extent there is less of a reason to build up suspense and just push the violence, which is one of my few complaints in the film as the suspense is what kept the first one running strong. While I do complain about the amount of suspense there is still plenty to go around with some amazing returns to scenes from the original film as well as surprises that you really won't see coming.As a sequel to a horror film that is top notch this one is able to give you part of the feeling of the original in an enjoyable way. We are given surprises, some suspense, and an amazing ending. Without giving you spoilers there is a twist at the end that would allow for another entry into the franchise that would not only give us a return to the caves but another aspect as well that could prove interesting. I salute Harris for giving us a great sequel to an amazing movie and will easily suggest this to anyone who enjoyed the first The Decent.",4,Not as good as the original but very worth watching!,1301788800,"04 3, 2011",2011,3012,"['Descent', 'Part', '2', 'direct', 'DVD', 'sequel', 'Descent', 'one', 'favorite', 'horror', 'films', 'time', 'Going', 'direct', 'DVD', 'usually', 'have', 'be', 'nothing', 'worried', 'fact', 'much', 'Cabin', 'Fever', '2', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'fun', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Jon', 'Harris', 'who', 'was', 'involved', 'editing', 'original', 'Descent', 'screen', 'play', 'written', 'not', '1', 'not', '2', '3', 'authors', 'J', 'Blakeson', 'James', 'McCarthy', 'James', 'Watkins', 'three', 'writers', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'overly', 'extensive', 'history', 'what', 'were', 'able', 'put', 'together', 'here', 'should', 'change', 'near', 'future.The', 'sequel', 'exactly', 'how', 'sequel', 'should', 'directly', 'first', 'film', 'ended', 'was', 'rather', 'worried', 'how', 'casting', 'would', 'be', 'had', 'done', '0', 'research', 'ahead', 'time', 'are', 'treated', 'having', 'return', 'Shauna', 'Macdonald', 'Sarah', 'woman', 'brutally', 'traumatized', 'first', 'film', 'memory', 'what', 'happened', 'friends', 'media', 'having', 'field', 'day', 'trying', 'find', 'local', 'sheriff', 'decided', 'only', 'hope', 'finding', 'so', 'out', 'when', 'explore', 'cave', 'believe', 'may', 'lead', 'other', 'women', 'also', 'suspect', 'was', 'covered', 'blood', 'was', 'not', 'own', 'was', 'bit', 'annoyed', 'temporary', 'amnesia', 'beginning', 'film', ""n't"", 'last', 'long', 'was', 'realistically', 'only', 'way', 'could', 'explain', 'away', 'how', 'willing', 'go', 'back', 'look', 'friends.When', 'memory', 'come', 'back', 'motivation', 'aside', 'escaping', 'mines', 'moment', 'are', 'conveniently', 'Sheriff', 'who', 'are', 'clearly', 'setup', 'hate', 'offset', 'accidentally', 'cause', 'cave', 'trapping', 'safe', 'way', 'out', 'been', 'removed', 'can', 'only', 'move', 'further', 'hopefully', 'leave', 'exit', 'are', 'quick', 'stumble', 'mutants', 'first', 'film', 'are', 'more', 'vicious', 'were', 'previously', 'were', 'rescue', 'team', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'other', 'people', 'know', 'exactly', 'where', 'were', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'now', 'extent', 'less', 'reason', 'build', 'up', 'suspense', 'just', 'push', 'violence', 'one', 'few', 'complaints', 'film', 'suspense', 'what', 'kept', 'first', 'one', 'running', 'strong', 'do', 'complain', 'amount', 'suspense', 'still', 'plenty', 'go', 'around', 'amazing', 'returns', 'scenes', 'original', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'surprises', 'really', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming.As', 'sequel', 'horror', 'film', 'top', 'notch', 'one', 'able', 'give', 'part', 'feeling', 'original', 'enjoyable', 'way', 'are', 'given', 'surprises', 'suspense', 'amazing', 'ending', 'giving', 'spoilers', 'twist', 'end', 'would', 'allow', 'entry', 'franchise', 'would', 'not', 'only', 'give', 'return', 'caves', 'aspect', 'as', 'well', 'could', 'prove', 'interesting', 'salute', 'Harris', 'giving', 'great', 'sequel', 'amazing', 'movie', 'will', 'easily', 'suggest', 'anyone', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'Decent']",N/A

1329642,A268EEWUXYCA8Q,B0037E8HNI,Terry Mesnard,"[53, 64]","The Descent didn't need a sequel.  It was a pitch-perfect horror film, one of the best I've seen in the last decade or longer, that incorporated high amounts of tension, a desperate struggle, some amazing jump-out-of-your-skin scares, great characters that you actually cared about and just the right amount of gore.  I loved that film.  Its original UK ending was also such a great, sad and interesting way to close it out.  But apparently, The Descent: Part 2 decides to forgo that horror classic ending and instead uses the American/""happy"" ending.  It's interesting to note that the sequel is ""Part 2"" as opposed to simply The Descent 2.  It indicates that it is an extension of the first film, as opposed to a sequel.  As such, to discuss Part 2, I'll have to talk about the first one.  You've been warned.The American ending of The Descent finds Sarah crazed and amnesiac with fear of her plight from the previous film, running to a rescue truck.  During the time she and her team have been lost, the local sheriff has started a search party for Juno, who not only was left for dead by Sarah for her infidelity and a misunderstanding, but is also a senator's daughter.  Sarah is taken to a hospital where said sheriff, Sheriff Vaines, decides that not only is Sarah a suspect in the missing spelunkers (for her shirt was covered in blood) but that she must go back underground to help locate them.  Never mind the fact that this probably wouldn't happen in real life because 1) she's obviously hurt 2) mentally unstable and 3) uh...she has no memory, remember?  Also forgetting the fact that it seems awfully coincidental that she happens to not remember that the cave system is swarming with cannibalistic creatures, we now have a reason for more bloodshed.That's pretty much the movie in a nutshell.  Part of the reason the first film was so powerful and shocking was because director Neil Marshall used two different types of terror and helped add some twists to his film.  The first part had a claustrophobic, fearful feeling that maybe you were going to be watching Alive...Underground.  But once that type of horror was getting a little stale, he does a complete 180 and now they are fending for their lives against some unknown group of carnivorous cave dwellers.  It was expertly filmed and paced to perfection.  Part 2 tries to ape that same style.  It has the same opening credit sequence, has a similar overall motif and even the same music.  In a lot of ways feels like a retread...except nowhere near as good.  Again you have a group of people who have no clue they are being hunted by monsters.  Again you have a small cave-in that causes the group to be splintered, etc. etc.  The only problem is that you, the viewer, is in on the twists this time and it really just gives the entire film a ""been there, done that"" feel.  To counter-balance this, Part 2 almost turns into a gross-out ""comedy,"" where Jon Harris (the director) finds more and more ways to drench his protagonists with blood and finds various ways to make sure that blood pours into someone's mouth.  I think this happened at least two or three times.  It was almost comedic.The final nail in the coffin is that the characters this time aren't anywhere near as interesting or developed as in the first film.  They quickly turned into crawler fodder and their only reason for being there was to be offed in various ways.  Only problem is that, in the first film, I cared.  In this one, I didn't.

1329643,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B0037E8HNI,trebe,"[3, 3]","An adventure following six women in a cave system in North Carolina, The Descent (2005), director Neil Marshall's follow up to Dog Soldiers, became kind of a big hit, and elevated Marshall's status in the horror genre.  Dark, claustrophobic, atmospheric, and terrifying, The Descent (D1) tapped into humanity's primal fears, as the spelunkers encounter vicious carnivorous cave ""crawlers"".The popularity and box office success of the Saturn award winner, provided the impetus to continue the saga, with Jon Harris who edited the first film, making his directorial debut.  Neil Marshall who wrote the original screenplay is onboard as executive producer, but passed the writing responsibilities on to a team of three writers.  What follows assumes some familiarity with D1, and will include some major spoilers, so proceed at your own peril.The Descent Part 2 (2009) (D2) picks up shortly after where the first film concluded, with a bloody Sarah (Shauna McDonald) being found by a park ranger, and taken to a hospital with no memory of what has happened.  Sheriff Vaines (Gavan O'Herlihy) suspects that Sarah may have killed her friends, and in a completely ridiculous move, forces her to join a group searching for survivors.  Setting aside the moral and legal ramifications, a shell-shocked Sarah is present when Vaines, his deputy Elen Rios (Krysten Cummings), and three ""expert"" cave explorers, Dan (Douglas Hodge), Cath (Anna Skellern), and Greg (Joshua Dallas), take an elevator ride down an old mine shaft, and begin to search.D2 does not try very hard to recapture the mood and atmosphere of the underground environment from the original film.  In the sequel, the settings are generally well lighted, with the intense choking darkness and tight quarters seen in The Descent, almost non-existent.  While in D1, six slim well fit women struggled to navigate through some tight spots, this time with a couple of chunky males along, the amount of crawling in tight quarters is limited to one short scene.  Physical fitness is definitely a factor, as few in this second group appear to be capable of heavy climbing, or hanging by their fingertips.  Allowances were probably made for Gavan O'Herlihy, as the oldest and largest in the group.  While there are some physically challenging stunts and fight scenes, the heavy duty action in D2 is performed by a select few in the team, and the stuntmen in the crawler suits.Instead of close friends familiar with spelunking, we have three pretty clueless ""experts"", two cops unqualified to be underground, and Sarah, who should still be in a hospital bed.  A few of the relationships work, in a clich&eacute;d sort of way, but most of the team is there primarily as crawler food, and thanks to the writers, the group displays few signs of rational behavior.As her memory gradually returns, Sarah gets spooked, and she bolts away from the group and disappears.  In a brainless move, an enraged Vaines heads off to try and find her.  Further compounding the madness, Vaines' single gunshot creates a cave in that traps one, and separates the rest of the group, just before the crawlers strike.While Greg makes an early exit in a pretty routine death, the writers do create an interesting situation where Cath is trapped in a void below a rockslide, with a hungry crawler trying to get to her.  After making an unlikely escape that features a crushing kill, she reunites with Dan.  The pair discovers the body of Sam, hanging from the roof of the cave, where she died in the first film.  This situation is more physically manageable for these actors, but in a trend that will repeat later, death occurs from a fall into a chasm, featuring less than impressive CG effects.  The level and quality of gore is well below the original, as the aim seems to be grossing out the audience, with blood dripping into mouths, and wading in crawler poop.The film's big twist involves the return of Juno Kaplan (Natalie Mendoza), who was presumed dead after Sarah stuck an axe into her leg.  Juno shouldn't even be able to walk, but faking a limp, her presence provides some much needed energy and kickass crawler killing ability, when the story is beginning to flounder.  It's obvious that Mendoza is older and heavier, but it's sure great to see her, particularly as she is teamed with the chubby Vaines, for whom even walking seems to be a challenge.This may be controversial, but Juno kind of got a bum rap in The Descent.  Yes, she had an affair with Sarah's husband, but does that mean Sarah had the right to sentence her to die?  Juno did stick a pick into Beth's neck, but it was an adrenaline fueled accident, as Beth snuck up on her in the heat of battle.  While it was cowardly for Juno to leave Beth to die, she also fought ferociously to prevent a crawler from taking Holly's dead body.  In the end, the most significant occurrence in the sequel is the reconnection between Sarah and Juno.  Battling side by side, anything that was left hanging is resolved.In another idiot move, Vaines handcuffs himself to Sarah.  When he winds up hanging over a cliff, the ladies are quick to cut him loose, resulting in more spotty CG special effects.  With a little more patience, everyone could have escaped, but we do get one last battle and a tearful reconciliation, before the writers deal out one final blow to the head.Compared to the average creature feature, The Descent 2 isn't a bad film, however its many shortcomings become very pronounced, when it is compared to the original.  The writers make many questionable decisions, but bringing Juno back is one thing they do get right.  Without her, D2 would have less of a connection to D1, and would be a much weaker film.  Another nice touch is that when Holly's video camera is found, it provides the means for the four characters killed in D1 to appear in D2, in newly created video footage that is played back.The much esteemed original sets the bar pretty high, and while Part 2 falls well short, it's still a fun watch.  With the element of surprise gone, and more brightly lighted sets, the crawlers may not be as scary, but it still requires a solid effort to terminate them.  Part 2 may not completely satisfy fans of the original, but without Neil Marshall in control, and a first time director in charge, the results could easily have been much worse.

1329644,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0037E8HNI,Tsuyoshi,"[13, 21]","[The following review contains spoilers for those who have not seen the original ""The Descent.""]There are so many sequels made in Hollywood. Here is one from the UK film industry. It is only natural that producers consider turning successful films into a franchise with sequels and spin-offs. Though I am not against the idea itself, ""The Descend: Part 2"" is a sequel that they shouldn't have made. No, not this way.Back in 2005 Neil Marshall surprised us with his sophomore outing ""The Descent,"" a riveting horror about five explorers trapped deep in a mountain cave. Those who remember the devastating ending will be relieved (or shocked) to learn that Sarah (Shauna Macdonald) is really alive.Unfortunately, terribly shocked Sarah remembers nothing about the horrifying events described in the original. The even more unfortunate thing is that the rescue party, of which members are obviously amateurs and totally unprepared for the task, decides on taking Sarah herself (still hospitalized) into the Appalachian cave again as a guide. One of the characters claims she might remember something deep down there.This incredible setup is followed by a story that is redundant and thrill-free. Most of us have seen the original, so what is the point of watching the ""rescue party""? We know what happened to the other four characters. Perhaps more importantly, we know what will happen to the new characters, too. Yes, crawlers. There is one nice twist as to the fate of one character of the original, but it is not just enough.But the biggest problem is that ""The Descend: Part 2"" is badly paced, edited and acted. Nothing is done to build up the suspense. The claustrophobic atmosphere that impressed in the original is gone, and the film's misguided ""toilet humor"" is just embarrassing. I'm sorry to say this, but editor-turned-director Jon Harris (his debut as director) is not ready for the job.

She's hospitalized and the local sheriff Redmond Vaines (Gavin O'Herlihy)has plenty of questions particularly because Juno from the ""lost"" expedition was the daughter of a politician.Vaines insists that she take his team back into the caves hoping to find any survivors or at the very least the remains of Sarah's five friends. As Sarah and the team go deeper into the Appalachian caves they discover the bodies, camera and the remains left behind by the creepers that attacked Sarah and her friends before.Capably edited and directed by Jon Harris (who edited the original ""The Descent"", ""Kick A$$"" and ""Layer Cake""), ""The Descent 2"" fails to match the original because it lacks the compelling characters, strong writing and acting of the first film. Many will also feel a bit frustrated by the ending of the film which clearly sets up some sort of third sequel.That isn't to say the film isn't entertaining--it is but ""The Descent 2"" can't beat the original film for the sense of claustrophobia, tension and well written/defined characters. For those that didn't like the ending original ending of the first film (the theatrical cut of the first film was different from the version on DVD which had the British ending), I suspect you won't like the ending here either.The image quality is pretty good and we get some nice extras including a commentary track from Jon Harris and Actors Shauna MacDonald, Krysten Cummings & Anna Skellern. We also get deleted scenes, a featurette on the making of the sequel as well as a story board gallery.Although ""The Descent 2"" isn't necessarily a bad film it fails to capture the quality of the original film.",3,A descent in quality but still entertaining,1272499200,"04 29, 2010",2010,2062,"['sequel', 'formula', 'just', 'replicating', 'first', 'film', 'scene', 'scene', 'Descent', 'Part', '2', 'entertaining', 'absurd', 'sort', 'way', ""n't"", 'have', 'shock', 'value', 'first', 'film', 'have', 'quite', 'emotional', 'wallop/power', 'original.Sarah', 'Carter', 'Shauna', 'MacDonald', 'side', 'road', 'bloody', 'mess', 'memory', 'what', 'happened', 'comrads', 'seen', 'Descent', 'hospitalized', 'local', 'sheriff', 'Redmond', 'Vaines', 'Gavin', ""O'Herlihy"", 'plenty', 'questions', 'particularly', 'Juno', 'lost', 'expedition', 'was', 'daughter', 'politician.Vaines', 'insists', 'take', 'team', 'back', 'caves', 'hoping', 'find', 'survivors', 'very', 'least', 'remains', 'Sarah', 'five', 'friends', 'Sarah', 'team', 'go', 'deeper', 'Appalachian', 'caves', 'discover', 'bodies', 'camera', 'remains', 'left', 'behind', 'creepers', 'attacked', 'Sarah', 'friends', 'before.Capably', 'edited', 'directed', 'Jon', 'Harris', 'who', 'edited', 'original', 'Descent', 'Kick', 'A', 'Layer', 'Cake', 'Descent', '2', 'fails', 'match', 'original', 'compelling', 'characters', 'strong', 'writing', 'acting', 'first', 'film', 'Many', 'will', 'also', 'feel', 'bit', 'frustrated', 'ending', 'film', 'clearly', 'up', 'sort', 'third', 'sequel.That', ""n't"", 'say', 'film', ""n't"", 'entertaining', 'Descent', '2', 'ca', ""n't"", 'beat', 'original', 'film', 'sense', 'claustrophobia', 'tension', 'well', 'written/defined', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'ending', 'original', 'ending', 'first', 'film', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'different', 'version', 'DVD', 'had', 'British', 'ending', 'suspect', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'ending', 'here', 'either.The', 'image', 'quality', 'pretty', 'good', 'get', 'nice', 'extras', 'including', 'commentary', 'track', 'Jon', 'Harris', 'Actors', 'Shauna', 'MacDonald', 'Krysten', 'Cummings', 'Anna', 'Skellern', 'also', 'get', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'featurette', 'making', 'sequel', 'as', 'well', 'story', 'board', 'Descent', '2', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'bad', 'film', 'capture', 'quality', 'original', 'film']",N/A
1329653,A2A0FBLKJN4ZY5,B0037E8HNI,W. freeman,"[3, 7]","I had mixed feelings going into this one since Neil Marshall didn't actually DIRECT this one, but then i saw he was the Executive Producer so i said i'll give it a shot. Most films like that where the Director gives the franchise over to someone else(via Steven Spielberg and Jurassic Park) it usually ends up just ok or a complete train wreck, thats not the case here. The atomosphere is great, the acting is about the same as the last one, better in some spots, the creatures are seen much much more, and the graphic violence is even more intense. Not to spoil it to those who haven't seen it or even the first, but Sarah who escapes near death from the first film survives only to be brought back to see what happened to the other girls in the caves. Then chaos pretty much insues from this point on, the tension is very good, although the POP-UP scary factor really isn't here like it was in the first time, but there are some truly tense tense moments. The only few things that i disliked or thought were corny was that in one part after one of the cops has seen people grimly killed by the creatures, even after all this she panics in a crawl space when she sees a rat crawl by her and nearly gets two people killed, this is laughable. Also there is a part in the movie that probably should have made it get an unrrated mark, which is surprising that it didnt anyways. They fall into a hole of nasty brown liquid with chunks floating in it, any clues yet? Yes they see thats what it is when one of the creatures is on a cliff above them and takes a dump down into the giant brown pool, it does show it dropping not coming out though, still this is not for the squemesh(i guess it had no smell or there nostrils were just closed up). So it is a worthy sequel with a few good added extra scares and some more violence, the ending however leaves you wondering, will there be a Descent Part 3, hmm time will tell, but i hope not because this pretty much covered everything that needed to be. No lose ends here. So if you enjoy the first you'll love this one as well, same good filming, same beasts and the same overall atmosphere takes you on another gross Descent, part 2 that is. :)",4,Very Good,1270252800,"04 3, 2010",2010,2186,"['had', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'going', 'one', 'Neil', 'Marshall', 'did', ""n't"", 'actually', 'DIRECT', 'one', 'then', 'i', 'saw', 'was', 'Executive', 'Producer', 'i', 'said', 'i', ""'ll"", 'give', 'shot', 'Most', 'films', 'where', 'Director', 'franchise', 'someone', 'else', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'usually', 'up', 'just', 'ok', 'complete', 'train', 'wreck', 'not', 'case', 'here', 'atomosphere', 'great', 'acting', 'same', 'last', 'one', 'better', 'spots', 'creatures', 'are', 'seen', 'much', 'much', 'more', 'graphic', 'violence', 'even', 'more', 'intense', 'Not', 'spoil', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'even', 'first', 'Sarah', 'who', 'escapes', 'death', 'first', 'film', 'only', 'be', 'brought', 'back', 'see', 'what', 'happened', 'other', 'girls', 'caves', 'Then', 'chaos', 'pretty', 'much', 'insues', 'point', 'tension', 'very', 'good', 'POP-UP', 'scary', 'factor', 'really', ""n't"", 'here', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'are', 'truly', 'tense', 'tense', 'moments', 'only', 'few', 'things', 'i', 'disliked', 'thought', 'were', 'corny', 'was', 'one', 'part', 'one', 'cops', 'seen', 'people', 'grimly', 'killed', 'creatures', 'even', 'crawl', 'space', 'when', 'rat', 'crawl', 'nearly', 'two', 'people', 'killed', 'laughable', 'Also', 'part', 'movie', 'probably', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'get', 'unrrated', 'mark', 'surprising', 'anyways', 'fall', 'hole', 'nasty', 'brown', 'liquid', 'chunks', 'floating', 'clues', 'yet', 'Yes', 'see', 'thats', 'what', 'when', 'one', 'creatures', 'cliff', 'dump', 'down', 'giant', 'brown', 'pool', 'show', 'dropping', 'not', 'coming', 'out', 'still', 'not', 'squemesh', 'i', 'guess', 'had', 'smell', 'nostrils', 'were', 'just', 'closed', 'up', 'worthy', 'sequel', 'few', 'good', 'added', 'extra', 'scares', 'more', 'violence', 'ending', 'however', 'wondering', 'will', 'there', 'be', 'Descent', 'Part', '3', 'hmm', 'time', 'will', 'tell', 'i', 'hope', 'not', 'pretty', 'much', 'covered', 'everything', 'needed', 'be', 'lose', 'ends', 'here', 'So', 'enjoy', 'first', ""'ll"", 'love', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'same', 'good', 'filming', 'same', 'beasts', 'same', 'overall', 'atmosphere', 'gross', 'Descent', 'part', '2']",N/A
