But Missy(Beethoven's girlfriend) is owned by a evil women who hates dogs. She just wants Missy for money because she is a pure blood. Beethoven is split from his love throughout the whole movie. I felt sorry for beethoven. But the puppies are okay with Beethoven's owners for a while. Charles Grodin was funny than ever. I enjoyed every minute of this movie. It is funny and heartwarming like the original.

Of course they need to capitalize on that success and try their hands at a sequel.  Thankfully, despite some regurgitation of gags and themes, `Beethoven's 2nd' works.  It isn't an all-around hit like the first, but it manages to remain engaging and doesn't fall into the many pitfalls of many sequel films.  This one adds some more dogs to the mix (surefire way to ensnare the kids in the family) including a litter of puppies and adds a dognapper in order to make `Beethoven's 2nd' exciting.

E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Beethoven's 2nd is probably just as good as the first, though since this one focuses more on Beethoven's girlfriend and *especially* the family of INCREDIBLY adorable puppies, it may even be better.  Hard to believe Saint Bernard puppies start out so small only to end up as gigantic overprotective beasts!  Though some tell me they're actually friendly dogs.  I wouldn't know!While I have the original Beethoven movie nearly memorized due to watching it excessively as a child, I can appreciate Beethoven's 2nd for being relatively fresh.  Essentially it's the same storyline, overdone heroic orchestration (that wears thin, don't you think?), dog running adventures, and everything else you've come to love about the original Beethoven.Now however, there's a really mean lady (who I've seen on Law & Order among other shows- a quick google search reveals her name to be Debi Mazar) with angry piercing green eyes and a New York accent, and her boneheaded idiotic husband (or boyfriend) that try to capture their female Saint Bernard (Beethoven's girlfriend) along with the puppies when they realize they can make a nice profit off of them.  These mean people don't really give a rats behind about the puppies which is really sad, cruel and unfortunate.I really think Beethoven perfectly executes a spectacular family movie that holds up really well with very little in the way of offensive things for children.  This is a major bonus.  This movie also stars Danny Masterson, the sunglass-wearing kid (Hyde) from That 70's Show.  I believe this was his first appearance in movies or any kind of television but don't quote me on that, heh.Some of the segments you will see in Beethoven's 2nd are a little strange and you have to realize it's a family movie and not worth taking seriously from a storyline point of view, but the one scene where the older daughter wraps Beethoven's cord around a post on the bottom of a deck, then walks into the house where her partying boyfriend is up to no good and waiting for her in the upstairs bedroom only for Beethoven to get angry at all the beer being spilled on top of him resulting in the angry dog eventually ripping the post out (and subsequently, all the partying kids falling into the water) only for the daughter to thank Beethoven afterwards was hard to believe.  How did she know the dog was responsible for the decks collapse?The sped up hamburger eating competition was a little unnecessary serving only to waste a few minutes with a silly irrelevant scene.  Oh but I LOVE when the two ""bad guys"" (the woman and man I mention above) are washed down the river, and the family is standing over the hilltop watching this happen and the mother quite hilariously looks at her kids and says ""Well... who's hungry!""

Beethoven is a very large, slobbery dog who often comes into conflict with his owner (Charles Grodin), and this movie follows the dog as he falls in love with another large dog.  A stork brings by puppies, and Beethoven becomes a father.  Unfortunately, Beethoven's wife (girlfriend?  fiance?  mate?) is in the middle of a custody battle between an owner and his evil ex-wife.  Even by Beethoven's standards, the plot here is thin.Beethoven is a good movie -- it's funny, and it's just campy enough to make even the most serious moviegoers crack a smile.  Unfortunately, Beethoven's 2nd just isn't as good as the first.  Where the first movie has plenty of funny dog-centric humor (a muddy Beethoven shaking on his owner's bed, for example), this installment seems a bit more interested in the interactions in the family and between the adults.  Unfortunately, the family dynamics never really congeal like they do in the first, and all it does is serve to frustrate those looking for the same laughs the first movie carried.  If you really loved Beethoven, I'd recommend skipping on this one (maybe going to the third movie) or just watching the first over again.Maybe it's the change of director (Rod Daniel, director here, did not direct the first), but this movie is uneven.  There are some really bizarre moments as well:  One of the family's daughters is almost sexually abused, but luckily Beethoven is able to pull down an entire water-side cabin to save her.This review is based on the Amazon streaming video option.
