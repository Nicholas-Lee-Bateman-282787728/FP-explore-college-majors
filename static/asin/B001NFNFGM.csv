If you like pretty postcard views of cities and sunsets, this is your thing.  If you like to see Samantha Brown in a bikini (several times), you'll enjoy this.  And if you like to see her doing wacky and scary stunts, you're in luck.But this set can scarcely be considered in depth or even representative of the cities and places she visits.  She likes all the food and drinks--or pretends to for the sake of being polite.  She takes you to mostly pleasant scenes--except on Cape Cod and Austin.  And she does look very nice in a bikini.Lastly, this is not for diabetics, however.  It's cloying sweet.  It's cute.  Ms. Brown is cute.  Cute women laugh mirthlessly at nothing.

As a travel agent I keep an arsenal of videos of different places to show clients.  These videos are great but the average traveler should just use them to look an area.  Sam gets special priviledges that the regular traveler doesn't get so if you are looking at these to do things in the area, just keep in mind you don't have a camera following you and most of her adventures are set up with that in mind.",4,Great Places,1391040000,"01 30, 2014",2014,483,"['really', 'watch', 'Sam', 'Brown', 'get', 'idea', 'places', 'travel', 'agent', 'keep', 'arsenal', 'videos', 'different', 'places', 'show', 'clients', 'videos', 'are', 'great', 'average', 'traveler', 'should', 'just', 'use', 'look', 'area', 'Sam', 'special', 'priviledges', 'regular', 'traveler', ""n't"", 'get', 'so', 'are', 'looking', 'do', 'things', 'area', 'just', 'keep', 'mind', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'camera', 'following', 'most', 'adventures', 'are', 'set', 'up', 'mind']",Samantha Brown's Passport to Great Weekends: Collection 1

I am glad to see this on DVD.  I did look for that when I purchased the DVD.  this show some interesting perspectives on some interesting places.  Sam usualy has a good show and is a good narator.  I like a lot of Travel channel videos, but some are availible only in a format that is limited in its usability.  again I am glad to see the DVD format here.  video on demand does not lend itself to good compatibility on different players  sometimes I fail to understand what the recording industry is thinking in this country.  why not allow recording to DVD and put the royalty tax on the Recording Discs.  that is another can of worms.  this video is very good and provides entertaining video viewing.  again I am glad it is on DVD.",5,I like this,1284163200,"09 11, 2010",2010,843,"['good', 'video', 'formats', 'used', 'travel', 'channel', 'videos', 'limited', 'usability', 'am', 'glad', 'see', 'DVD', 'did', 'look', 'when', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'show', 'interesting', 'perspectives', 'interesting', 'places', 'Sam', 'usualy', 'good', 'show', 'good', 'narator', 'like', 'lot', 'Travel', 'channel', 'videos', 'are', 'availible', 'only', 'format', 'limited', 'usability', 'again', 'am', 'glad', 'see', 'DVD', 'format', 'here', 'video', 'demand', 'not', 'lend', 'good', 'compatibility', 'different', 'players', 'sometimes', 'fail', 'understand', 'what', 'recording', 'industry', 'thinking', 'country', 'why', 'not', 'allow', 'recording', 'DVD', 'put', 'royalty', 'tax', 'Recording', 'Discs', 'can', 'worms', 'video', 'very', 'good', 'entertaining', 'video', 'viewing', 'again', 'am', 'glad', 'DVD']",Samantha Brown's Passport to Great Weekends: Collection 1
