1460846,ATSFS4004URM7,B005GYXO30,"Jim Phillips ""Experience is what you get when...","[0, 0]","I am probably a little jaded on this.  This series ran for one season and is really made for kids.  I remember playing and loving the game so when I saw this I was very hopeful.  This series is supposed to be set before the game.  At the game you are a fully qualified pilot on your first assignment.  In this series you are an academy student who knows how to fly but just don't have the experience to be a full pilot.  A lot of the characters from the game are here.  Which I find just frustrating.On the other hand, the characters that are here from the game are the same people.  It seems Universal hired the same actors to voice the characters.  Kind of a cool decision.Back to the bad.  As I mentioned this is really made for kids so the messages and themes of the stories are very apparent.Back to the good. They do have a good message and if I had kids I would want them to watch this series.It just doesn't do much for an old guy.Production values are good.  There are 13 episodes on two disc's.  No skips and the animation is quite good.There are no special features.If you are nostalgic about the game its not a bad purchase.  Not really what you would hope for but not bad.  If you have kids this becomes a much better buy.",3,Not bad but not great,1401580800,"06 1, 2014",2014,1235,"['am', 'probably', 'little', 'jaded', 'series', 'ran', 'one', 'season', 'really', 'made', 'kids', 'remember', 'playing', 'loving', 'game', 'so', 'when', 'saw', 'was', 'very', 'hopeful', 'series', 'supposed', 'be', 'set', 'game', 'game', 'are', 'fully', 'qualified', 'pilot', 'first', 'assignment', 'series', 'are', 'academy', 'student', 'who', 'how', 'fly', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'experience', 'be', 'full', 'pilot', 'lot', 'characters', 'game', 'are', 'here', 'Which', 'find', 'just', 'frustrating.On', 'other', 'hand', 'characters', 'are', 'here', 'game', 'are', 'same', 'people', 'Universal', 'hired', 'same', 'actors', 'voice', 'characters', 'Kind', 'cool', 'decision.Back', 'bad', 'mentioned', 'really', 'made', 'kids', 'so', 'messages', 'themes', 'stories', 'are', 'very', 'apparent.Back', 'good', 'do', 'have', 'good', 'message', 'had', 'kids', 'would', 'want', 'watch', 'series.It', 'just', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'old', 'guy.Production', 'values', 'are', 'good', 'are', '13', 'episodes', 'two', 'disc', 'skips', 'animation', 'quite', 'are', 'special', 'features.If', 'are', 'nostalgic', 'game', 'not', 'bad', 'purchase', 'Not', 'really', 'what', 'would', 'hope', 'not', 'bad', 'have', 'kids', 'much', 'better', 'buy']",Wing Commander Academy
1460847,A2QW2HL4QI4TUT,B005GYXO30,Madeline Z.,"[3, 4]","Wing Commander, Xenosaga, Paragon Lost and Halo Legends are all based on computer games.  Wing Commander is not a copy of the other three.  It&#8217;s unique in its execution.  It is also animated American science fiction, not Japanese Anime science fiction.Its plot is familiar: aliens are pestering the humans.  The aliens are always pestering the humans.  This time the aliens look like bipedal lions.  Having the aliens look like something familiar to us worked very well because that made it possible for the aliens to have distinct personalities.Each episode of Wing Commander is a self-contained  ministory.  The plot of each ministory is different enough so that I never felt that I was watching the same story over and over again.  That was very good.  The downside is that Wing Commander doesn&#8217;t have a firm conclusion.  If you don&#8217;t like a story that doesn&#8217;t have a firm conclusion, that&#8217;s going to be a problem for you.The characters aren&#8217;t deep.  That is normal for this type of story.  There is a low grade conflict between practical Commodore Tolwyn and more idealistic Cadet Maverick.  Some of the aliens were more interesting characters than the humans were.  There were two female human pilots, but they were more passive characters than the male pilots.  Near the end of Wing Commander, a female alien appeared.  She was a person of authority and gave the orders and the other aliens obeyed.  I thought that it was unusual for the story to have a strong female alien character, but not a strong female human character.None of the scenes are enhanced by using CGI.  That makes the animation look somewhat dated, but the animation is still very satisfactory.  You won&#8217;t be overawed by the animation, but you won&#8217;t be disappointed by it.Of the four DVD&#8217;s that I listed at the beginning of my review, I would rate Wing Commander second.  I would rate Xenosaga first because of Shion and Kirsch.  Those two characters made the story.  I would put Halo Legends last because it was a mishmash, leaving Paragon Lost in third place by default.I purchased my copy of Wing Commander from Amazon.  Amazon&#8217;s description of the DVD states that it has subtitles, but my copy didn&#8217;t.  Although the audio is unusually clear, if you have a hearing impairment, you might not be able to follow the dialogue.  Using the Product Update button, I tried twice to get Amazon to change their description to &#34;no subtitles&#34;, but it was never changed.",4,I gave it second place,1364083200,"03 24, 2013",2013,2509,"['Wing', 'Commander', 'Xenosaga', 'Paragon', 'Lost', 'Halo', 'Legends', 'are', 'based', 'computer', 'games', 'Wing', 'Commander', 'not', 'copy', 'other', 'three', '8217', 's', 'unique', 'execution', 'also', 'animated', 'American', 'science', 'fiction', 'not', 'Japanese', 'Anime', 'science', 'fiction.Its', 'plot', 'familiar', 'aliens', 'are', 'pestering', 'humans', 'aliens', 'are', 'always', 'pestering', 'humans', 'time', 'aliens', 'look', 'bipedal', 'lions', 'Having', 'aliens', 'look', 'something', 'familiar', 'worked', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'possible', 'aliens', 'have', 'distinct', 'personalities.Each', 'episode', 'Wing', 'Commander', 'self-contained', 'ministory', 'plot', 'ministory', 'different', 'enough', 'never', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'same', 'story', 'over', 'again', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'downside', 'Wing', 'Commander', 'doesn', '8217', 't', 'have', 'firm', 'conclusion', 'don', '8217', 't', 'story', 'doesn', '8217', 't', 'have', 'firm', 'conclusion', '8217', 'going', 'be', 'problem', 'you.The', 'characters', 'aren', '8217', 't', 'deep', 'normal', 'type', 'story', 'low', 'grade', 'conflict', 'practical', 'Commodore', 'Tolwyn', 'more', 'idealistic', 'Cadet', 'Maverick', 'aliens', 'were', 'more', 'interesting', 'characters', 'humans', 'were', 'were', 'two', 'female', 'human', 'pilots', 'were', 'more', 'passive', 'characters', 'male', 'pilots', 'end', 'Wing', 'Commander', 'female', 'alien', 'appeared', 'was', 'person', 'authority', 'gave', 'orders', 'other', 'aliens', 'obeyed', 'thought', 'was', 'unusual', 'story', 'have', 'strong', 'female', 'alien', 'character', 'not', 'strong', 'female', 'human', 'character.None', 'scenes', 'are', 'enhanced', 'using', 'CGI', 'animation', 'look', 'somewhat', 'dated', 'animation', 'still', 'very', 'satisfactory', 'won', '8217', 'be', 'overawed', 'animation', 'won', '8217', 'be', 'disappointed', 'it.Of', 'four', 'DVD', '8217', 'listed', 'beginning', 'review', 'would', 'rate', 'Wing', 'Commander', 'second', 'would', 'rate', 'Xenosaga', 'first', 'Shion', 'Kirsch', 'two', 'characters', 'made', 'story', 'would', 'put', 'Halo', 'Legends', 'last', 'was', 'mishmash', 'leaving', 'Paragon', 'Lost', 'third', 'place', 'default.I', 'purchased', 'copy', 'Wing', 'Commander', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', '8217', 's', 'description', 'DVD', 'subtitles', 'copy', 'didn', '8217', 'audio', 'unusually', 'clear', 'have', 'hearing', 'impairment', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'follow', 'dialogue', 'Using', 'Product', 'Update', 'button', 'tried', 'twice', 'get', 'Amazon', 'change', 'description', '34', 'subtitles', '34', 'was', 'never', 'changed']",Wing Commander Academy
1460848,A2G6W7HPS2E9P1,B005GYXO30,"Richard H. Burk ""Old Confederate""","[3, 9]","As animation goes this wasn't too bad. I was a huge fan of the old computer video game of this, in which Mark Hamil, John Rhys Davies, and Malcom McDowel actually stared. It was one of the early games that actually used real actors for the characters and didn't have them CGI. In this animation they did use Mark & Malcom for the voice overs. I had never seen this series on TV but looks to be at least 2 to 3 seasons long. For those of you who are fans of this game, you might also want to take a look at ""WING COMMANDER"" with Freddie Prinze Jr. It was also very well done and true to the game.Wing Commander",3,NOT BAD FOR ANIMATION VERSION,1349568000,"10 7, 2012",2012,609,"['animation', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'was', 'huge', 'fan', 'old', 'computer', 'video', 'game', 'Mark', 'Hamil', 'John', 'Rhys', 'Davies', 'Malcom', 'McDowel', 'actually', 'stared', 'was', 'one', 'early', 'games', 'actually', 'used', 'real', 'actors', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'CGI', 'animation', 'did', 'use', 'Mark', 'Malcom', 'voice', 'overs', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'series', 'TV', 'be', 'least', '2', '3', 'seasons', 'long', 'who', 'are', 'fans', 'game', 'might', 'also', 'want', 'take', 'look', 'WING', 'COMMANDER', 'Freddie', 'Prinze', 'Jr', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'true', 'game.Wing', 'Commander']",Wing Commander Academy
