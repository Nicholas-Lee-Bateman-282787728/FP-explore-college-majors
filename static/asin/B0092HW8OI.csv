1584092,A2582KMXLK2P06,B0092HW8OI,B. E Jackson,"[0, 3]","Truthfully, Touchback is better than most high school or college football movies.  At least this one has a storyline that's sometimes compelling, whereas most of them are boring because they copy every overdone cliche in the book (such as partying, drinking, women, typical immature silliness, etc).Touchback succeeds in that it focuses strictly on the quarterback living with his mother, and they can be categorized as a broke family out in the farmlands.  In fact, they're basically living in the middle of nowhere.  The mother is working constantly, and she's probably the best actor (actress) in the movie because she -much like her son- is extremely determined to bring home enough money to support a family.  Gotta respect a mother or father who works hard.  The way she constantly keeps her son on the right track with strict advice whenever he seems to lose focus is not only really good acting, but an important life lesson.  Equally, the son treats her with tremendous respect.If should be said however, that Touchback is a slooooow-moving drama and is probably only occasionally funny.  In fact the humor is strictly based around subtle moments and nothing ever really outrageous or anything happens.  A good example- the quarterback and a nerd from school go to an ice cream shop only to eventually end up skinny dipping late at night with a couple girls.  Nice humor but nothing incredible or anything.Smalltown folks would probably appreciate a movie like this more than those who expect lots of excitement around every corner, and you know, I basically fit that smalltown category what with growing up in a town with less than 3,000-4,000 but... eh, I really wanted more in the way of substance and this movie fails to deliver.  It has worthwhile moments and unfortunately boring moments as well.  At least there's a good -though predictable- football game at the end.  You can probably already guess how the game unfolds and even figure out who wins, but what a game!  If you've ever seen the movie Extraordinary Measures with Harrison Ford, the atmosphere and pacing from that film and Touchback are strikingly identical.With all this said, I do actually recommend Touchback since it's a nice family movie to sit down with the kids and watch.",3,football out in the country,1362182400,"03 2, 2013",2013,2259,"['Truthfully', 'Touchback', 'better', 'most', 'high', 'school', 'college', 'football', 'movies', 'least', 'one', 'storyline', 'sometimes', 'compelling', 'whereas', 'most', 'are', 'boring', 'copy', 'overdone', 'cliche', 'book', 'such', 'partying', 'drinking', 'women', 'typical', 'immature', 'silliness', 'etc', '.Touchback', 'strictly', 'quarterback', 'living', 'mother', 'can', 'be', 'categorized', 'broke', 'family', 'farmlands', 'fact', ""'re"", 'basically', 'living', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'mother', 'working', 'constantly', 'probably', 'best', 'actor', 'actress', 'movie', '-much', 'son-', 'extremely', 'determined', 'bring', 'home', 'enough', 'money', 'support', 'family', 'Got', 'ta', 'respect', 'mother', 'father', 'who', 'hard', 'way', 'constantly', 'son', 'right', 'track', 'strict', 'advice', 'whenever', 'lose', 'focus', 'not', 'only', 'really', 'good', 'acting', 'important', 'life', 'lesson', 'Equally', 'son', 'tremendous', 'respect.If', 'should', 'be', 'said', 'however', 'Touchback', 'slooooow-moving', 'drama', 'probably', 'only', 'occasionally', 'funny', 'fact', 'humor', 'strictly', 'based', 'around', 'subtle', 'moments', 'nothing', 'ever', 'really', 'outrageous', 'anything', 'happens', 'good', 'example-', 'quarterback', 'nerd', 'school', 'go', 'ice', 'cream', 'shop', 'only', 'eventually', 'end', 'up', 'skinny', 'dipping', 'late', 'night', 'couple', 'girls', 'Nice', 'humor', 'nothing', 'incredible', 'anything.Smalltown', 'folks', 'would', 'probably', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'more', 'who', 'expect', 'lots', 'excitement', 'corner', 'know', 'basically', 'fit', 'smalltown', 'category', 'what', 'growing', 'up', 'town', 'less', '3,000-4,000', 'eh', 'really', 'wanted', 'more', 'way', 'substance', 'movie', 'deliver', 'worthwhile', 'moments', 'unfortunately', 'boring', 'moments', 'well', 'least', 'good', '-though', 'predictable-', 'football', 'game', 'end', 'can', 'probably', 'already', 'guess', 'how', 'game', 'unfolds', 'even', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'what', 'game', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'Extraordinary', 'Measures', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'atmosphere', 'pacing', 'film', 'Touchback', 'are', 'strikingly', 'identical.With', 'said', 'do', 'actually', 'recommend', 'Touchback', 'nice', 'family', 'movie', 'sit', 'down', 'kids', 'watch']",Touchback

It played in very few theatres and clearly had little marketing behind it.  It always amazes me when I come across a gem of a film like ""Touchback"" that I had never heard of until recently when there are countless crappy movies being released every weekend it seems with millions of marketing dollars being poured into them.  Right now you can catch this on-demand if you have Starz in your cable line up if you want to give it a quick watch before buying it.  This movie has what so many films are lacking IMHO.  It has solid writing with excellent character development.  Anyone who has lived awhile will find a character in this film they can identify with.  The PQ is excellent as is the AQ.  I have watched the film 3 times now including a listen through of the commentary track that I thoroughly enjoyed.  The film holds up extremely well on repeat viewings.  Being that this film was partially shot not too far from where I grew up made it that much more special to me.  I think this film will find a very large audience in the coming years.  I don't care for most sports films made anymore.  This one was definitely an exception.  The life lessons portrayed in this story are invaluable.

I love feel good movies. I think there are enough problems in this world that we all have to face that now and then we need something to jolt us out of the doldrums and brighten our day. It's why I always cite IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE as one of my favorite movies.The movie opens in 1991 and high school senior and quarterback Scott Murphy (Brian Presley) has it all. He's been voted Mr. Football for the state of Ohio, has been recruited by Ohio State University and is about to play his last high school game. But fate has a different destiny for Murphy.With seconds on the clock and the possible win of the game, Murphy changes the call of Coach Hand (Kurt Russell) and runs the ball for a touchdown. But as he leaps to the win, two players from the other team catch him in the air and severely break his leg. It's a career ending wound.Flash forward to Murphy's life 15 years later. Still living in the small Ohio town of Coldwater, Murphy wears a brace on his leg, deals with the pain and is feeling the bite from the recession. Murphy works with his old coach on the volunteer fire brigade. He refuses to take part in helping with the high school team and always bypasses the school reunions. His best high school friend, now a well paid professional player and married to Murphy's high school flame, wants to get together but Murphy refuses.With a somewhat small field of soybeans to keep his family going, Murphy meets with the bank concerning a loan that they feel should never have been made. Within days all he owns will be on the block. All he needs is two weeks till the crop comes in, but they won't budge.Murphy returns home to his wife Macy (Melanie Lynskey) and two children. This family is close but the turns in his life are taking their toll on Murphy. A frost the next morning threatens the crop but he's able to get the last combine in the county. Bad luck continues as he hits a stump and breaks it down. With no hope, Murphy decides to end it all, parking his battered old truck overlooking the high school football field and plugging his exhaust so he can die leaving behind his insurance policy to take care of his family.And that's when things begin to happen. Murphy wakes to find himself taken back to the past, 15 years earlier. None of the misfortune that happened to him has taken place, yet he retains in his mind all that's happened. He's back with his girlfriend, the team still has a chance to make things happen and if he doesn't make the same play he did those years ago he can become the professional ball player he dreamed of, leaving behind this small town and taking care of his mother (Christine Lahti).But as I said, he has all those memories intact. He sees Macy as he never saw her when he was in high school. They met while he was in the hospital where she volunteered. Now he sees her as she was then. Those affections are still there. He wants to change his life, but will he do so at the cost of losing Macy and his unborn children? Or will he try to convince here to come with him on this new journey? Does Macy even want to go along? Or does she love the life she has in this small community?While not given a deep, dark look in this film it does pose more serious questions than most time travel films have in the past. Given the opportunity would you change the mistakes in your past or would you see that somehow they might not have been mistakes? Perhaps they were destined to happen all along. And if you realize that then maybe those mistakes brought you more happiness than you realized.The movie also takes a nice look at what it means to live in a small community. Towns that aren't mega-cities have their own speed and way of doing things. People know almost everyone else or at least a majority of people who live there. Sure, you might know everyone else's business, but you can also count on the people around you when you need to.The ending to this movie (don't worry not a true spoiler) can be seen in some ways far beyond when it finally unreels. But the different options of where it could go are all thought out. The eventual outcome is not what you might expect but it is quite satisfying.Russell is the name star here but he's not the featured player. He adds great support to this cast which has stand outs in both Presley and Lynskey. They do a tremendous job here, making a believable couple who have something stronger than the character of Murphy realizes.If you need a feel good movie then look no further.

He goes on with life but does so by going through the motions of it while his mind is emotionally caught in time. He replays video tapes of the event that blocked him in order to understand what or how and why he might have created it. Was he cursed by having an absent father and an overworked mother?A decade and a half passes and the separation between his body and mind reaches a serious point when he passes out and enters into an altered coma-like state. In it he relives his life and courageously and honourably corrects his mistakes. So far so good, until he reaches the moment of truth where he has to decide whether he wants to continue in the lucid dream-like world or return to daily life and real people. The mentor at this point has gone as far as he can and it's now up to our protagonist.He realizes that the needed creation of fantasies has its limits and dangers. He opts for life by choosing the realistic and wholesome love that was there all along. With this, he wakes up from the coma and connects to the joys of his family and community and becomes a mentor himself. The ""curse"" is broken and he is healed.As a metaphor, I think the beautiful woman who plays the wind instrument represents his feelings/muse and when he chooses her over the grandiosity of his egoic self, he saves himself.The movie plays Boston's More Than A Feeling which alone is a clue that you're in for a thoughtful and inspirational tale.

1584120,AB1CKA6B849SP,B0092HW8OI,zeus,"[25, 25]","Wow, what a great family movie!!!This movie is definitely worth your money.The story is simple. Scott Murphy (Brian Presley) is a great quarterback for a small town high school football team that plays the Cinderella role in a state final championship game against a big time high school football team in Ohio. They end up winning the state championship on a great play by Scott, however, Scott gets severely injured, resulting in being crippled for life. We follow Scott for a while, 20 years later on the eve of a big celebration of the state championship, where all players are coming back to town for the 20th anniversary of their win. That is the first part of the movie (about 30 minutes). Scott gets somehow the opportunity to try to live these moments all over again while knowing what will happen. And we are in for 90 minutes of a very intense emotional performance by Kurt Russell, Brian Presley, Melaney Lynskey, and Christine Lahti. The script, the dialogues, the direction are all FANTASTIC. In addition, the football plays are really intense and mostly played by the actors themselves. So you also see great football too.The movie shows what it takes to become a great person and why you need to make choices in life, you need to stick with them and never show regret. The discussion that Scott has with his mom before the game is for the books. The movie also shows the corruption at the level of recruiting. The Ohio State coach tells Scott not to play (or to ...pay attention tonight because they are sold on him, and most of the players from the other team will be on his team next year) on the eve of the championship game at a dinner, in front of his mother, in order to stay healthy and come to play for Ohio State. This level of arrogance demonstrates that the higher you go in the football hierarchy the more corrupt the system is.Will Scott use this phenomenal chance to change the outcome of the game? Will he play or not? Will he change the plays or not in order for him to stay healthy and go to Ohio State? Will they still win? We keep guessing all the time. And suddenly while we keep guessing he wakes up, and everything becomes clear.Please watch this movie with your kids and they will learn what it takes to become a real person. They will learn that there are things in life more important than a big car, a big house, and a beautiful cheer leader as a girlfriend/wife. There are things in life that have no price. You just have to find it and do it, regardless of the emotional and physical price you have to pay. And you (only) always know that you did the right thing!Make sure you get your Kleenex box available on the coffee table because the end of the movie is totally unpredictable and not one person around you will have dry eyes.Five stars all the way. Everything in this movie is great! You can watch it over and over again with your kids and then with your grand kids. Never gets old. In addition, great football too as a bonus. All football scenes were directed and coordinated by Sports Studio's Mark Ellis, who has worked on several other films that needed football plays (like We Are Marshall). No tatoos, no profanity, no nudity, just hard hitting football. Mark Ellis also plays the coach of the other team, the Red Raiders.",5,This little town is really special,1347667200,"09 15, 2012",2012,3277,"['Wow', 'what', 'great', 'family', 'movie', 'movie', 'definitely', 'worth', 'money.The', 'story', 'simple', 'Scott', 'Murphy', 'Brian', 'Presley', 'great', 'quarterback', 'small', 'town', 'high', 'school', 'football', 'team', 'Cinderella', 'role', 'state', 'final', 'championship', 'game', 'big', 'time', 'high', 'school', 'football', 'team', 'Ohio', 'end', 'up', 'winning', 'state', 'championship', 'great', 'play', 'Scott', 'however', 'Scott', 'severely', 'injured', 'resulting', 'being', 'crippled', 'life', 'follow', 'Scott', 'while', '20', 'years', 'later', 'eve', 'big', 'celebration', 'state', 'championship', 'where', 'players', 'are', 'coming', 'back', 'town', '20th', 'anniversary', 'win', 'first', 'part', 'movie', '30', 'minutes', 'Scott', 'somehow', 'opportunity', 'try', 'live', 'moments', 'over', 'again', 'knowing', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'are', '90', 'minutes', 'very', 'intense', 'emotional', 'performance', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'Brian', 'Presley', 'Melaney', 'Lynskey', 'Christine', 'Lahti', 'script', 'dialogues', 'direction', 'are', 'FANTASTIC', 'addition', 'football', 'plays', 'are', 'really', 'intense', 'mostly', 'played', 'actors', 'also', 'see', 'great', 'football', 'too.The', 'movie', 'what', 'become', 'great', 'person', 'why', 'need', 'make', 'choices', 'life', 'need', 'stick', 'never', 'show', 'regret', 'discussion', 'Scott', 'mom', 'game', 'books', 'movie', 'also', 'corruption', 'level', 'recruiting', 'Ohio', 'State', 'coach', 'tells', 'Scott', 'not', 'play', 'pay', 'attention', 'tonight', 'are', 'sold', 'most', 'players', 'other', 'team', 'will', 'be', 'team', 'year', 'eve', 'championship', 'game', 'dinner', 'front', 'mother', 'order', 'stay', 'healthy', 'come', 'play', 'Ohio', 'State', 'level', 'arrogance', 'higher', 'go', 'football', 'more', 'corrupt', 'system', 'is.Will', 'Scott', 'use', 'phenomenal', 'chance', 'change', 'outcome', 'game', 'Will', 'play', 'not', 'Will', 'change', 'plays', 'not', 'order', 'stay', 'healthy', 'go', 'Ohio', 'State', 'Will', 'still', 'win', 'keep', 'guessing', 'time', 'suddenly', 'keep', 'guessing', 'up', 'everything', 'becomes', 'clear.Please', 'watch', 'movie', 'kids', 'will', 'learn', 'what', 'become', 'real', 'person', 'will', 'learn', 'are', 'things', 'life', 'more', 'important', 'big', 'car', 'big', 'house', 'beautiful', 'cheer', 'leader', 'girlfriend/wife', 'are', 'things', 'life', 'have', 'price', 'just', 'have', 'find', 'do', 'regardless', 'emotional', 'physical', 'price', 'have', 'pay', 'only', 'always', 'know', 'did', 'right', 'thing', 'Make', 'sure', 'get', 'Kleenex', 'box', 'available', 'coffee', 'table', 'end', 'movie', 'totally', 'unpredictable', 'not', 'one', 'person', 'will', 'have', 'dry', 'eyes.Five', 'stars', 'way', 'Everything', 'movie', 'great', 'can', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'kids', 'then', 'grand', 'kids', 'Never', 'old', 'addition', 'great', 'football', 'too', 'bonus', 'football', 'scenes', 'were', 'directed', 'coordinated', 'Sports', 'Studio', 'Mark', 'Ellis', 'who', 'worked', 'several', 'other', 'films', 'needed', 'football', 'plays', 'Are', 'tatoos', 'profanity', 'nudity', 'just', 'hard', 'hitting', 'football', 'Mark', 'Ellis', 'also', 'coach', 'other', 'team', 'Red', 'Raiders']",Touchback
