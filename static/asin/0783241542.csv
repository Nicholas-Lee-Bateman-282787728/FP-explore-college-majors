However, the aspect that makes it different from the rest of the films of this sort  is the underlying message...(which due to the sake of not spoiling the  ending I can't give away).  The storyline follows four young men who decide  to lose their virginity before graduation.  What follows is an all out  laugh riot!  The unrated version isn't much different from the  R-rated;just a little extra nudity; but as a result is far superior.

This borderline-porno, excessively obscene and ridiculous junk is a real bad influence on kids. Eugene Levy lost the respect I had for him in his 'Armed and Dangerous' days (1986) and the late night comedy series putting him along side John Candy. Please, leave the sex, nudity, graphic and pervasive language and obscene sexually suggestive behaviour and topics to adults. I cant believe producers and directors are letting these kids between the ages of 7 and 20 get up in front of a camera and behave like this. This is the kind of garbage that influences kids to emmulate these characters and in the end winds up on the 'O'Reily Factor'. Parents, dont let your kids get their hands on this. Trends USED to be OK to follow but this is pushing way over the limit, Ive never reviewed a movie here that I didnt like, but this has no place in any home.

Well, one day I had nothing to do, so I decided to watch it. I was very surprised by &quot;American Pie&quot; because the movie is actually funny.&quot;American Pie&quot; does have some elements that could have contributed to make another silly movie, like the gross-out humor, the usual share of T&A;, the fouled language, in few words, the typical ingredients of a cheap teen movie.But &quot;American Pie&quot; has key elements that set the movie apart from its predecessors: the cast is kinda charismatic, some of these actors and actresses will be lost in oblivion and others will be famous, but it's hard to deny that these cast is funny and sure they had fun while they were filming &quot;American Pie&quot;. Special mention to Eugene Levy, he brings the wisdom of a veteran, and mixes very well with the young newcomers, of course, he steals every scene that he appears on.The girls in this kind of movies usually are attractive, and thankfully (for the guys, at least) &quot;American Pie&quot; has pretty girls like Tara Reid, Alyson Hannigan, Shannon Elizabeth and Mena Suvari, not all these girls have real acting talent, but at least in &quot;American Pie&quot; they got the work done.On the other hand, this original &quot;American Pie&quot; movie is the only one truly worthy in the series.

This is one of the factors that sets American Pie above the others; it is a (somewhat) original idea about 4 friends who vow to lose their virginity by grauduation, but they have a problem: they don't know how to treat girls. The each have their own path that eventually leads them to the Prom, with or without a date. This a VERY funny movie. Many of the jokes are gross-out gags, but the beauty of it is that many of them are brand new (beer anyone?), and the ways the quartet go about wooing their prospects are great. Also, the girls are given substancial, if not equal, screentime as their male counterparts, so we can get to know them as well as our heroes. Finally, I would like to share some trivia that I just became aware of.  When Alyson Hannigan was first called in to do this movie, the filmmakers wanted her to play Heather, but she preferred the character Michelle.  If she had played Heather, there would have been parallels to her character Willow on the show Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  1. She would date a guy named Oz.  2. She would sing a song called ""Do You Believe In Magic?"" (Willow was a witch.)  3. Oz finishes a song saying ""Scooby bop"".  Buffy's gang of friends is often referred to as the ""Scooby Gang"".

At the heart of this hormone induced madness is Jim Levenstein (Jason Biggs), a curious young man who has a thing or two to learn about the birds and the bees. His easygoing and overbearing father (Eugene Levy, who steals the show) doesn't do much to help, nor do his friends Oz (Chris Klein), Finch (Thomas Ian Nicholas) and Kevin (Eddie Kaye Thomas) or big jerk Stifler (Sean William Scott).Eventually, Jim learns a thing or two and ends up with band geek Michelle (Alyson Hannigan).Buoyed by a witty script courtesy of Adam Herz and a strong supporting cast that includes Tara Ried, Mena Suvar and Natasha Lyonne, ""American Pie"" may well be remembered for spawning some of the funniest moments in comedy history. From the tongue tornado to Finch's bathroom break to the Nadia internet scene to the pale ale to the classic pie sex, it will be difficult to pick the best part since there are so many.My advice is that if you really want to enjoy a good laugh, you must go and pick up ""American Pie"" (and its sequels, but a little later on).

""Porky's"" made sure of that. That is the film that AP will probably be most referenced too. What a shame. This movie, while still raunchy and loaded with hormone crazed teens, is what a good teen sex comedy should be. It is very easy for the cynics to blast it and see it as nothing but a lame, unintelligible pile of trash that is just about horny kids wanting to have sex. How unfortunate for them. More on that a bit later. The plot for the film is pretty basic and has been served as a plot line for many a film over the years. We have a batch of kids, our nerdy hero Jim(Jason Biggs), cool jock Oz(Chris Klein), wild man Stifler(Sean William Scott), Intellectual dork Finch(Eddie Kaye Thomas), and nice guy Kevin(Thomas Ian Nicholas), who make a pact with each other. They all plan to lose their virginity on prom night. They, among many other teens in real life, don't want to leave high school as virgins. And what better night to do it than on prom night?. It happens in real life, why not in the movie?. Each one has a potential female in their lives. Oz has Heather(Mena Suvari), Kevin has Vicky(Tara Reid), Finch has Mrs. Stifler(Jennifer Coolidge), and Jim, well, he has band geek Michelle(the perfect Alyson Hannigan). Eugene Levy is also on hand as Jim's dad. One of the best parts of the film. While some people, mostly parents, probably won't like the message that maybe it's better to leave high school not being a virgin anymore, it is something that is a real issue with high school teens. I think they are a lot smarter than to follow what a movie says. They can make decision on their own. The film is nicely written. It has, unlike most other teen comedies, an intelligent script with good dialogue and well developed characters. But, as usual, there are many reviews who say otherwise. Over their heads. It just depends on if you actually look to see it. What makes the film most appealing, is that these characters can be you and your friends. Or, at the very least, people you know in high school. The friendships between the guys is nicely developed. You really get a sense that these guys are real friends. You can thank the actors for that. They really make their characters come alive and make them real and believeable. It doesn't need to be Shakespearean acting, because this is supposed to be about life. This is what these actors do with their roles, and they succeed. Lost on a lot of people. One of my favorite things about this film, an aspect that so many people didn't pick up on, is that this film really has a lot of heart. You really didn't expect a film like this to have a sweetness to it, but it does. Jim's speech about being sick of the whole sex thing at the prom was nice. The scenes with him and his dad were touching as well. This is what really made the film. The movie is really different because of it. Who would expect a movie filled with sexual innuendo and some crude humor, to be that way?. Unfortunatley, this part didn't get thru to a lot of bashers of this film. You may not like the aspects of this film, or the character's intentions, but that's life. I, for one, really enjoyed spending time in this zany, youthful world. AP is no cinematic treasure, but then again, it was never meant to be. Nor would it ever want to be.

Previous reviewers have been right to say  it's like a version of 'Porkies' for the nineties - it's a modern updating  of the 80's frat-house comedy genre in more ways than one.  By contrast  with its earlier (inferior) cousin, 'American Pie' is intelligent,  unexploitative and has decent roles for its female characters.It's  also tempting to compare 'Pie' to 'There's Something About Mary' because  both films share a high gross-out factor - Jim's exploits with the pie, his  sock (!) and a collection of adult magazines form a running joke through  the course of the whole film, and there probably isn't a sexual taboo that  isn't confronted.  And of course there's the funny-tasting beer and the  laxative gags (both of which the film would have been better without,  really).But to compare 'American Pie' with either of these other films  is to miss what makes is truly unique - its outlook is unashamedly romantic  and optimistic, with a complex set of messages that you'd never expect from  a film nominally about four guys out to get laid.  Our heroes'  relationships evolve in entirely different, unexpected ways, largely  avoiding clich&eacute;s and cheap gags too... resulting in much of the film being  totally hilarious: the live-sex Internet broadcast is awesomely funny.

In the tradition of Animal House, Fast Times At Ridgemont High, and other such comedies, the film makes its mark as one of the better written screenplays in the genre. The clever one-liners and memorable scenes are so abundant that few seconds of the film lack one or the other. If you can't laugh at American Pie, then you've got serious problems. Along with Office Space and There's Something About Mary, it's one of the best comedies of its time...Jason Biggs plays the role of Jim Levenstein a normal high school student in American suburbia. Together with his friends Chris 'Oz' Ostreicher (Chris Klein), Kevin Myers (Thomas Ian Nicholas), and Paul Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas), he makes a pact to lose his virginity by prom night. Seeing that it's senior year, the task calls for immediate attention, and the four friends find that it's not as easy as they had originally planned.Kevin's task seems to be the easiest as he is involved with long-time girlfriend Vicky Lathum (Tara Reid). Meanwhile, Chris joins the chorus (discovering he has an unknown talent off the lacrosse field) where he falls for Heather (Mena Suvari) who initially wants nothing to do with him. Finch relies on self-perpetuated rumors to make his personal stock rise, while Jim comes close to doing the deed with the beautiful foreign exchange student Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth). When Nadia is sent home, Jim's hopes rest on band camp survivor Michelle Flaherty (Alyson Hannigan). As prom night closes in, each must determine his own fate, while wondering what the final outcome was for his friend...In American Pie, Eugene Levy steals the show as Jim's father. His monotone, straight-forward attempts to be hip and to befriend his son are gut-busting in nature. His feeble attempts to explain sex and his encounter with Jim and the pie in the kitchen are some of the funniest scenes in the movie. That's saying a lot, because American Pie is a hilarious movie with lots of buzz words like ""M.I.L.F."" and quirky characters like Steve Stifler (Seann William Scott). That said, only a certain age demographic will find American Pie to be among their film favorites.Scenes such as the Internet cam with Jim and Nadia will be forever famous, and the movie lacks any sort of a slowdown. From beginning to end, the laughs are truly non-stop. Following its release, American Pie became an instant cult classic, influencing its target generation and pioneering the depths of the young adult vocabulary. Because of its utterly hilarious scenes and prominent role in the teenage comedy genre, American Pie ranks as a definite must-see movie...The DVD Report",5,One of the top comedies of its decade!,1113782400,"04 18, 2005",2005,2746,"['Nominated', 'zero', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'American', 'Pie', 'lewd', 'crude', 'teenage', 'comedy', 'probably', 'funniest', 'movie', '1999', 'tradition', 'Animal', 'House', 'Fast', 'Times', 'Ridgemont', 'High', 'other', 'such', 'comedies', 'film', 'mark', 'one', 'better', 'written', 'screenplays', 'genre', 'clever', 'one-liners', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'are', 'so', 'abundant', 'few', 'seconds', 'film', 'lack', 'one', 'other', 'ca', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'American', 'Pie', 'then', ""'ve"", 'got', 'serious', 'problems', 'Office', 'Space', 'Something', 'Mary', 'one', 'best', 'comedies', 'time', 'Jason', 'Biggs', 'role', 'Jim', 'Levenstein', 'normal', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'American', 'suburbia', 'Together', 'friends', 'Chris', ""'Oz"", 'Ostreicher', 'Chris', 'Klein', 'Kevin', 'Myers', 'Thomas', 'Ian', 'Nicholas', 'Paul', 'Finch', 'Eddie', 'Kaye', 'Thomas', 'pact', 'lose', 'virginity', 'prom', 'night', 'Seeing', 'senior', 'year', 'task', 'immediate', 'attention', 'four', 'friends', 'find', 'not', 'as', 'easy', 'had', 'originally', 'planned.Kevin', 'task', 'be', 'easiest', 'involved', 'long-time', 'girlfriend', 'Vicky', 'Lathum', 'Tara', 'Reid', 'Meanwhile', 'Chris', 'chorus', 'discovering', 'unknown', 'talent', 'lacrosse', 'field', 'where', 'Heather', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'who', 'initially', 'nothing', 'do', 'Finch', 'relies', 'self-perpetuated', 'rumors', 'make', 'personal', 'stock', 'rise', 'Jim', 'close', 'doing', 'deed', 'beautiful', 'foreign', 'exchange', 'student', 'Nadia', 'Shannon', 'Elizabeth', 'When', 'Nadia', 'sent', 'home', 'Jim', 'hopes', 'rest', 'band', 'camp', 'survivor', 'Michelle', 'Flaherty', 'Alyson', 'Hannigan', 'prom', 'night', 'closes', 'must', 'determine', 'own', 'fate', 'wondering', 'what', 'final', 'outcome', 'was', 'friend', 'American', 'Pie', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'show', 'Jim', 'father', 'monotone', 'straight-forward', 'attempts', 'be', 'hip', 'befriend', 'son', 'are', 'gut-busting', 'nature', 'feeble', 'attempts', 'explain', 'sex', 'encounter', 'Jim', 'pie', 'kitchen', 'are', 'funniest', 'scenes', 'movie', 'saying', 'lot', 'American', 'Pie', 'hilarious', 'movie', 'lots', 'buzz', 'words', 'M.I.L.F', 'quirky', 'characters', 'Steve', 'Stifler', 'Seann', 'William', 'Scott', 'said', 'only', 'certain', 'age', 'demographic', 'will', 'find', 'American', 'Pie', 'be', 'film', 'favorites.Scenes', 'such', 'Internet', 'cam', 'Jim', 'Nadia', 'will', 'be', 'forever', 'famous', 'movie', 'sort', 'slowdown', 'beginning', 'end', 'laughs', 'are', 'truly', 'non-stop', 'Following', 'release', 'American', 'Pie', 'became', 'instant', 'cult', 'classic', 'influencing', 'target', 'generation', 'pioneering', 'depths', 'young', 'adult', 'vocabulary', 'utterly', 'hilarious', 'scenes', 'prominent', 'role', 'teenage', 'comedy', 'genre', 'American', 'Pie', 'definite', 'must-see', 'movie', 'DVD', 'Report']",N/A

70358,AE42JLYPXUI45,0783241542,"Chad DeFeo ""(ChandlerBingFan)""","[1, 2]","In 1999, directior Chris Weitz brought us a film that is considered to be the funniest film in the history of movies. AMERICAN PIE is a favorite amongst millions of people around the world because of its perverted and sexual humor. The characters in this film are nothing short of hilarious, with the exception Jim's annoying, pain-in-the-a**, father.Jim Levenstein (played by Jason Biggs), Chris 'Oz' Ostrycker (played by Chris Klein), Kevin Myers (played by Thomas Ian Nicholas), & Paul 'Sh*tbreak' Finch (played by Eddie Kay Thomas) are four friends, nearing the end of their Senior year at East High School in Michigan. Neither of them has yet lost their virginity. Kevin is dating his high school sweetheart, Vickie Lathum (played by Tara Reid). Vicky is confused in knowing if she is ready or not to lose her virginity with Kevin, although, Vicky's best friend, Jessica (played by Natasha Lyone) tries to help her realize that she is. Oz has learned that in order to become closer with a girl in terms of dating one is to be sensitive. In doing so, he has joined East High's A cappella Jazz choir, where he meets Heather (played by Mena Suvari). They begin a heated relationship. Jim has been going stag since he can remember. He almost had a chance with Nadia (played by Shannon Elizabeth), the beautiful foreign exchanged student, but he blew his chance...twice. Finch, whom everyone calls, ""Sh*tbreak"", for he never takes a dump at school, has never seen himself with a girlfriend. The four friends vow to lose their virginity by prom night. With the help of their sex-hungry nemisis, Steve Stifler (played by Seann William Scott), the four friends find themselves realizing that prom night will, indeed, be the night they get lucky.Kevin will be attending the prom with Vickie. Jim will be attending the prom with Michelle Flarehity (played by Allison Hannigan), a flute-toting-band-camp-nympho-maniac geek, who only has stories about her dorky adventures from band camp. Oz will be attending the prom with Heather. Finch will be attending the prom with himself. The prom goes well, as the gang head off to Stifler's cottege out on Lake Michigan. Kevin is the first to get lucky with Vickie. Oz is the second, with Heather. Jim is the third, with Michelle. Finch is doubting his virginity-loss, until he meets...Stifler's mom (played by Jennifer Coolidge). Just when he continues to think he will not be lucky guy #4, he finds himself on the pool table with Stifler's mom.The film is jam packed with more comedy than I could discribe, and it is all featured here on this DVD, featuring hilarious outtakes, and other special features. Another feature that makes this particular DVD special is that it is the unrated version. As you all may know, Jim tries getting lucky with a homemade apple pie. If you watch the rated version, you'll see that Jim gets lucky with the pie, while standing up. If you watch the unrated version, you'll see Jim getting lucky with the pie, while spread out over the counter. Whether you watch the unrated version or the rated version, you will have to have surgery to repair your sides after they have been split from your laughing so hard. This is a great film and it should have been seen already by all of you. If not, then buy a copy for yourselves and get ready to laugh, as our version Porky's comes your way.",5,American Pie (1999),1098921600,"10 28, 2004",2004,3354,"['1999', 'directior', 'Chris', 'Weitz', 'brought', 'film', 'considered', 'be', 'funniest', 'film', 'history', 'movies', 'AMERICAN', 'PIE', 'favorite', 'amongst', 'millions', 'people', 'world', 'perverted', 'sexual', 'humor', 'characters', 'film', 'are', 'nothing', 'short', 'hilarious', 'exception', 'Jim', 'annoying', 'pain-in-the-a**', 'father.Jim', 'Levenstein', 'played', 'Jason', 'Biggs', 'Chris', ""'Oz"", 'Ostrycker', 'played', 'Chris', 'Klein', 'Kevin', 'Myers', 'played', 'Thomas', 'Ian', 'Nicholas', 'Paul', ""'Sh*tbreak"", 'Finch', 'played', 'Eddie', 'Kay', 'Thomas', 'are', 'four', 'friends', 'nearing', 'end', 'Senior', 'year', 'East', 'High', 'School', 'Michigan', 'Neither', 'yet', 'lost', 'virginity', 'Kevin', 'dating', 'high', 'school', 'sweetheart', 'Vickie', 'Lathum', 'played', 'Tara', 'Reid', 'Vicky', 'confused', 'knowing', 'ready', 'not', 'lose', 'virginity', 'Kevin', 'Vicky', 'best', 'friend', 'Jessica', 'played', 'Natasha', 'Lyone', 'help', 'realize', 'Oz', 'learned', 'order', 'become', 'closer', 'girl', 'terms', 'dating', 'one', 'be', 'sensitive', 'doing', 'so', 'joined', 'East', 'High', 'A', 'cappella', 'Jazz', 'choir', 'where', 'Heather', 'played', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'begin', 'heated', 'relationship', 'Jim', 'been', 'going', 'stag', 'can', 'remember', 'almost', 'had', 'chance', 'Nadia', 'played', 'Shannon', 'Elizabeth', 'beautiful', 'foreign', 'exchanged', 'student', 'blew', 'chance', 'twice', 'Finch', 'whom', 'everyone', 'Sh*tbreak', 'never', 'dump', 'school', 'never', 'seen', 'girlfriend', 'four', 'friends', 'vow', 'lose', 'virginity', 'prom', 'night', 'help', 'sex-hungry', 'nemisis', 'Steve', 'Stifler', 'played', 'Seann', 'William', 'Scott', 'four', 'friends', 'find', 'realizing', 'prom', 'night', 'will', 'indeed', 'be', 'night', 'get', 'lucky.Kevin', 'will', 'be', 'attending', 'prom', 'Vickie', 'Jim', 'will', 'be', 'attending', 'prom', 'Michelle', 'Flarehity', 'played', 'Allison', 'Hannigan', 'flute-toting-band-camp-nympho-maniac', 'geek', 'who', 'only', 'stories', 'dorky', 'adventures', 'band', 'camp', 'Oz', 'will', 'be', 'attending', 'prom', 'Heather', 'Finch', 'will', 'be', 'attending', 'prom', 'prom', 'well', 'gang', 'head', 'Stifler', 'cottege', 'Lake', 'Michigan', 'Kevin', 'first', 'get', 'lucky', 'Vickie', 'Oz', 'second', 'Heather', 'Jim', 'third', 'Michelle', 'Finch', 'doubting', 'virginity-loss', 'Stifler', 'mom', 'played', 'Jennifer', 'Coolidge', 'Just', 'when', 'think', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'lucky', 'guy', '4', 'pool', 'table', 'Stifler', 'mom.The', 'film', 'jam', 'packed', 'more', 'comedy', 'could', 'discribe', 'featured', 'here', 'DVD', 'featuring', 'hilarious', 'outtakes', 'other', 'special', 'features', 'feature', 'particular', 'DVD', 'special', 'unrated', 'version', 'may', 'know', 'Jim', 'getting', 'lucky', 'homemade', 'apple', 'pie', 'watch', 'rated', 'version', ""'ll"", 'see', 'Jim', 'lucky', 'pie', 'standing', 'up', 'watch', 'unrated', 'version', ""'ll"", 'see', 'Jim', 'getting', 'lucky', 'pie', 'spread', 'out', 'counter', 'watch', 'unrated', 'version', 'rated', 'version', 'will', 'have', 'have', 'surgery', 'repair', 'sides', 'have', 'been', 'split', 'laughing', 'so', 'hard', 'great', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'seen', 'already', 'not', 'then', 'buy', 'copy', 'yourselves', 'get', 'ready', 'laugh', 'version', 'Porky', 'way']",N/A

Its risque sexual material combines with the incredible sense of humor that nobody will forget.A group of four high school boys vow to lose their virginities before graduation.  All four think of a scheme to manuever their ladies to have sex with them.  There are losers, there are fools, there are sensatives, but there are no ordinaries.  Everyone has their funny outtakes dealing with their sex struggles.  Their actions change their lives forever.  Jason Biggs, Eddie Kay Thomas, Thomas Ian Nicholas, and Chris Klein participate in the wonderful quartet of friends.  Seann William Scott plays their party animal half-sidekick.  Every actor expresses their character comicly.  Even those with two-minute screen time are unforgettable.Those who are looking to kick back and have a good time should watch this comedy movie.

70384,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,0783241542,Dennis Littrell,"[2, 3]","This is a cute, even sweet, coming of ager with an attractive cast.  But be warned, if sex offends you, you will be offended.  It is also more than a little on the juvenile side, especially the first half or so.  I can't even discuss the subject matter on Amazon.com, which is just as well.  And you DON'T EVEN want to know why it is called &quot;American Pie.&quot;  Suffice it to say that if you're past your early twenties much of this will seem lame and adolescent.  If you're younger, you may just crack up over all the crude, but sometimes sharply observed humor.Thus the question: why did I watch it?  Easy: Mena Suvari.  The beauty of American Beauty is here a drama dweeb--or is that a drama geek?  Actually she sings in a jazz class, which I suppose is close to the same thing.  At any rate, she is not a cheer leader nor the queen of the hop, just a pretty girl with values.  She is excellent.  Also good in a supporting role is Alyson Hannigan (from TV's Buffy) as a nerd girl who surprises with what she learned at band camp.  Eddie Kaye Thomas as the boy (Paul Finch) who learns that women only get better with age is just perfect.  However, I think Jason Biggs was a little lamer than was absolutely necessary.  Sean William Scott was true to his part as your classic neanderthal jock.Funniest line, from Biggs, after finding Michelle gone in the morning: &quot;I was used--Cool!&quot;Another reason for watching this film is that one does get some, no doubt twisted, idea of what passes for adolescent sexual preoccupation these days and can compare such notions to an earlier era.  Call it suburban anthropology.As I was watching Mena Suvari I got to thinking about the appeal of her very captivating face.  Like fashion models and other stars with child-like faces, we adore her.  Why?  Call it neoteny. This led to a further thought.  In the future, as we continue to look more and more like our children, some day we and our children will look the same.  (Perhaps this could be a good idea for a science fiction story.)  Some say the appeal of imagined aliens is that they have child-like features (think of the big round heads and the big eyes).  But really they are unconscious caricatures of ourselves and the values that we most esteem, brains and photogenic eyes.Anyway, American Pie is kind of sweet if you are not offended by vivid depictions of adolescent sexuality or crude bathroom humor.  And there is more sophistication to the relationships than might be supposed at first blush.  It ends at the prom, as all good American coming of age flicks should.  The boys grow up and begin to learn the difference between love and sex, and the girls find they no longer have to teach the boys how to kiss.

Even over-hyped &quot;gross-out&quot;  scenes are presented totally within the context of the character's  situation; they don't come off as gratuitous at all. Winning performances  all around, it was especially gratifying to see the highly underrated  &quot;SCTV&quot; alumnus Eugene Levy being so well-utilized.

70388,A2198FZZMTJ38H,0783241542,D. Litton,"[21, 22]","It's lose it or loser in &quot;American Pie,&quot; the 1999 Universal  release about four high school senior boys determined to &quot;score&quot;  with the right girl before prom night. Jim (Jason Biggs) is a teenager with  an overload of hormones, trying everything from watching scrambled porn to  making it to home base with an apple pie in his own kitchen. His friends,  Kevin, Oz and Finch, all make a pact that they will lose their virginity by  the time prom arrives, and the rest of the movie is a roller-coaster of  hilarity as the four boys try each trick after another in hopes of scoring  with the girls set in their sights. Supplied with a superb cast that  includes &quot;American Beauty's&quot; Mena Suvari and Eddie Kaye Thomas  from &quot;The Rage: Carrie 2,&quot; the performances in this film are a  sure-fire hit all by themselves. Screenwriter Adam Herz struck gold with  the script for &quot;American Pie,&quot; employing outrageous and sometimes  subtle comedy while giving the audience something that they can relate to,  whether it be through reminiscence or present experience. First-time  directors Paul and Chris Weitz looked through the lens and captured one of  the most enlightening and hilarious comedies of 1999, not to mention the  decade. While some may think that the content of this movie is perverse and  ruins the effect the movie will have on its viewers, let me take this  moment to say that it only makes the film funnier, as we are able to laugh  at the things that actually happen to high school adolescents all over the  world. A movie that ranks up among such high-pitched comedies as  &quot;Happy Gilmore&quot; and &quot;Mrs. Doubtfire,&quot; &quot;American  Pie&quot; will have you rolling in your seat with laughter from beginning  to end.",4,"Raunchy, spicy, and sleazy good fun!",969235200,"09 18, 2000",2000,1788,"['lose', 'loser', 'quot', 'American', 'Pie', 'quot', '1999', 'Universal', 'release', 'four', 'high', 'school', 'senior', 'boys', 'determined', 'quot', 'score', 'quot', 'right', 'girl', 'prom', 'night', 'Jim', 'Jason', 'Biggs', 'teenager', 'overload', 'hormones', 'trying', 'everything', 'watching', 'scrambled', 'porn', 'making', 'home', 'base', 'apple', 'pie', 'own', 'kitchen', 'friends', 'Kevin', 'Oz', 'Finch', 'make', 'pact', 'will', 'lose', 'virginity', 'time', 'prom', 'arrives', 'rest', 'movie', 'roller-coaster', 'hilarity', 'four', 'boys', 'try', 'trick', 'hopes', 'scoring', 'girls', 'set', 'sights', 'Supplied', 'superb', 'cast', 'quot', 'American', 'Beauty', 'quot', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'Eddie', 'Kaye', 'Thomas', 'quot', 'Rage', 'Carrie', '2', 'quot', 'performances', 'film', 'are', 'sure-fire', 'hit', 'Screenwriter', 'Adam', 'Herz', 'struck', 'gold', 'script', 'quot', 'American', 'Pie', 'quot', 'employing', 'outrageous', 'sometimes', 'subtle', 'comedy', 'giving', 'audience', 'something', 'can', 'relate', 'be', 'reminiscence', 'present', 'experience', 'First-time', 'directors', 'Paul', 'Chris', 'Weitz', 'looked', 'lens', 'captured', 'one', 'most', 'enlightening', 'hilarious', 'comedies', '1999', 'not', 'mention', 'decade', 'may', 'think', 'content', 'movie', 'perverse', 'effect', 'movie', 'will', 'have', 'viewers', 'let', 'take', 'moment', 'say', 'only', 'film', 'funnier', 'are', 'able', 'laugh', 'things', 'actually', 'happen', 'high', 'school', 'adolescents', 'world', 'movie', 'up', 'such', 'high-pitched', 'comedies', 'quot', 'Happy', 'Gilmore', 'quot', 'quot', 'Mrs.', 'Doubtfire', 'quot', 'quot', 'American', 'Pie', 'quot', 'will', 'have', 'rolling', 'seat', 'laughter', 'beginning', 'end']",N/A
70389,A1XX5797TIZT5Q,0783241542,D. Mok,"[18, 19]","A sex comedy with a heart?  Say goodbye to pure harmless raunch -- American Pie, despite its gleefully gross sense of humour and obsession with all that is libidinous, actually also hides a real sensitivity behind  all the naughty jokes and embarrassing situations.Much like Fast Times  at Ridgemont High but to an even greater extent, American Pie makes you  laugh by daring to put its characters in the most ear-reddening of  situations.  Jason Biggs deserves a hand for diving into those situations  with pizazz while also keeping the character likeable, somebody you can  relate to.  Porky's certainly didn't have that.  An instantly appealing  cast (Chris Klein, Tara Reid, Mena Suvari, Eugene Levy) with a couple of  great comic gems in their midst (the pitch-perfect Natasha Lyonne, Eddie  Kaye Thomas, Shannon Elizabeth, Alyson Hanigan) keep things interesting  throughout, and the script -- despite its three-week-old-apple-pie premise  -- manages to achieve a freshness and wacky sense of humour.Some  characters are underdeveloped -- especially choirgirl Heather (Suvari),  Stifler (Seann William Scott) and Nadia (Elizabeth) -- but with so much  going on all the time, and such an appealing cast of characters across the  board, that can be forgiven.American Pie manages to evoke pathos along  with laughter, and therein lies its greatest strength.  When Vicky (Reid)  says, &quot;I realized nothing's perfect&quot;, the filmmakers sympathize  with her.

I dont know what you adults would think though,it does have some pretty silly and disturbing scenes....But otherwise,to me,this was a hilarious crude comedy,basically about 4 dudes that really wanna score,before graduation. It starts of with a funny scene,and the acting is very acceptable,but was blatant at times by some of the cast. The love relationships were fairly unrealistic,and biased.  Now,its not as easy as it sounds,this has more crude that sex scenes....now,you either find it hilarious,laughable or totally stupid thats up to you to decide.  The script was pretty well developed,and had some scenes,which left you crying for more.  To me,the bad point was how the film developed towards the end,it slowly begins to go downhill from there,but luckily it ends before they actually ruin anything.  Well....For the sex scenes themselves,were highly un-erotic,but not stupid,and the 4 dudes really do remind you of your friends!  Is it worth the rent??Certainly?? But I recommend that if your,what?Over 25 NOT to watch it unless your really hip and cool cause you WILL understand it,but find it disgusting,and laugh is disgust basically...

Let me just say up front: if you're thinking of getting this DVD for the &quot;outrageous!&quot; material, don't bother. Maybe, after growing up in a tabloid world, it's pretty hard to create something with shock value for us young people today. Or maybe this &quot;too hot for the big screen!&quot; stuff was just weak. [I should, to be fair, point out that the little quotes are from the ads and cover in Australia. I don't know if the region 1 version promotes it this way.]Anyway, I'm assuming that if you've looked this up you've already seen and appreciated the movie. So here's what you can expect from the disc:Commentary by director Paul Weitz, producer Chris Weitz, writer Adam Herz and cast members Eddie Kaye Thomas, Jason Biggs and Seann William Scott - Actually a well done track, with humor and notes on the production of the film. Basically, it's like listening to a group of guys you might know with some insight on technique.* Production notes - Usual stuff. If you're after some real detail, you know where to look.* Theatrical trailer(s) - So you can be reminded of how hilarious it is. Chances are you were subjected to endless trailers while it was being promoted, but in case you'd forgotten here's the evidence.* Outtakes - I was a little annoyed that they were shown in production format [poor sound, picture quality, ect]. None of it is really funny at all, the highlight being Jason Biggs practicing the pie scene.* Spotlight On Location - Not bad. Worth watching, but you won't feel the need to give it more that a couple of views. It's mostly the actors talking about their experience while making the movie, and comparing it to their own high school years. Example quote from Alyson Hannigan: &quot;I was a walking hormone.&quot;* Universal Records Soundtrack Presentation &amp; Music Highlights - Sample bits from the soundtrack. Pure promotional stuff.* Classic Quotes - They're in the movie. Why bother?Overall, I'd say that if you were 50/50 on if you liked this movie or not, you shouldn't get the DVD.

Shannon  Elizabeth will most definately have a future in front of the camera as she  played the droolworthy foreign exchange student.Unfortunetly word of a  sequel is out there. Leave it alone. Unless they start over with a new  group, or pull a great story out of their butts, any sequel will be an  injustice to the first. If they start over with a new group, it's more or  less a remake of the original, and if they continue with the original cast,  why bother?

Before I even saw this my favorite movie was Life isBeautiful but Im afraid American Pie beats LIB in being my favorite movie of all time. I had heard it was good and I had heard it was bad so I really wasn't sure what to expect. So I put it in and loved it so much that once it was over I watched again and then again. The next day I watched it three more times and so on. The story is simple: Four friends make a pact that by graduation they will lose their virginity. Jim (played by Jason Biggs whos great) is an unlucky guy who has a taste for apple pie. His friends Kevin (Thomas Ian Nichols) is a guy whose girlfriend is iffy on the fact of having sex but wants to, Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) is a regular guy who all the girls go crazy over because of some rumors and Oz (Chris Klien) is a jock who has a soft side. The four have some very different adventures from Jim getting caught by his parents in various acts, to Kevin using some techinques of his own, to Finch having a bathroom incident and Oz getting Mina Survari (lucky). What surprised me the most was the fact that American Pie was not as raunchy and shocking as I thought it would be but was very funny. I realized half-way through that this was a true to life movie that the audience could compare themselves to the characters. American Pie stands as a classic to me and is my all time favorite movie. Of course that will change in the near future but until then American Pie is the best.The DVD is loaded as is most other Universal Collector's Edition. First off we get a 10 minute behind the scenes look at the film which goes pretty in-depth on the making with interviews. Then we have a showcase of the soundtrack and music video &quot;You Wanted More&quot; by Tonic. Universal Showcase which contains two trailers one for &quot;Man on the Moon&quot; and the other for &quot;Snow Falling on Cedars&quot;. The outtakes which are very funny and contains the alternate pie scene. A commentary track which is very informative and entertaining not to mention hilarious is also on the disc. As is reccommendations with three trailers one for Blues Brothers, American Grafitti, and Animal House. There is tons of stuff packed on and the picture which is in widescreen 1:85:1 aspect of ratio which is well preserved. The Dolby Digitial 5.1 soundtrack which uses great surround sound in some scenes is very clear and overall great. So American Pie stands to me as an American Classic that I just cant get enough of.

But, and come close so you can get this the first time, IT WAS FUNNY!!  From the beginning with the ""sock incident"" to the ""pale ale"" scene to the end with Allyson Hannagins character Michelle. My sides hurt from all the laughter.  So here's the plot, Jim (Jason Biggs), Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas), Oz (Chris Klein) and Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) make a pact one day at a party to lose their virginity before graduation.  Kevins plan is to work on his girlfriend (Tara Reid) till she gives in, Oz (the jock) tries his charm on a choir girl (Mena Suvari), Finch (a 40 year old in an 18 year olds body) pays a girl (Natasha Lyonne) to tell her friends a few flattering lies about him, and Jim is basicly all around hopeless.  His chances of getting any drop down to negative 10 when he's caught creaming his jeans from one touch of the lovely Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth).  Now everyones plans goes according to... plan until they all basicly sabotage them selves one by one, some get help and some don't need it.  But in the end everyone gets what they want.  The movie is funny even though the premise of ""getting some"" has been around the movie industry since the invention of the camera.  It's also been done better like in all the Porky's movies or National Lampoons Animal House.  Now in my review I left out a few people but the two I missed that we all know about are Stifler (Seann William Scott) and Jim's dad (Eugene Levy) and they basicly steal the movie.  Stiflers ""pale ale"" scene is hall of fame type stuff and Jim's dad giving Jim a little chat on sex is embarassingly funny.  Stifler getting revenge on Finch is real gross and you can't stop laughing about but the way Finch got back at Stifler in the end was probably one of the worse things you could do to a guy.  I can't really say much else about the movie because most of it you have to see for yourself and my review does the movie no justice.  So if you like to laugh take an hour and a half out of your day and check this out.  And for those of you who didn't like the film, deal with it.  The movie has already been made and is in millions of homes around the world and there's nothing you can do about it.  Your not getting your money back if you saw it in theaters, you can't return it if you bought the dvd, and you have to accept the fact that Hollywood will be making more of these movies down the line.  They make them, we pay to watch them, we laugh, we go home, they get our money.  You see the movie on tv do what I do when I see something I don't like (Ex: those phony religous shows or networks or Jerry Farwell), change the channel.",4,American pie- Get a piece.  3 and a half to 4 stars,1063929600,"09 19, 2003",2003,2713,"['Ok', 'was', 'gross', 'childish', 'immature', 'been', 'done', 'many', 'times', 'better', 'movies', 'come', 'close', 'can', 'get', 'first', 'time', 'IT', 'WAS', 'FUNNY', 'beginning', 'sock', 'incident', 'pale', 'ale', 'scene', 'end', 'Allyson', 'Hannagins', 'character', 'Michelle', 'My', 'sides', 'hurt', 'laughter', 'here', 'plot', 'Jim', 'Jason', 'Biggs', 'Finch', 'Eddie', 'Kaye', 'Thomas', 'Oz', 'Chris', 'Klein', 'Kevin', 'Thomas', 'Ian', 'Nicholas', 'make', 'pact', 'one', 'day', 'party', 'lose', 'virginity', 'graduation', 'Kevins', 'plan', 'work', 'girlfriend', 'Tara', 'Reid', 'Oz', 'jock', 'charm', 'choir', 'girl', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'Finch', '40', 'year', 'old', '18', 'year', 'olds', 'body', 'girl', 'Natasha', 'Lyonne', 'tell', 'friends', 'few', 'flattering', 'lies', 'Jim', 'basicly', 'hopeless', 'chances', 'getting', 'drop', 'down', 'negative', '10', 'when', 'caught', 'creaming', 'jeans', 'one', 'touch', 'lovely', 'Nadia', 'Shannon', 'Elizabeth', 'Now', 'plans', 'according', 'plan', 'basicly', 'sabotage', 'one', 'one', 'get', 'help', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'end', 'everyone', 'what', 'want', 'movie', 'funny', 'even', 'premise', 'getting', 'been', 'movie', 'industry', 'invention', 'camera', 'also', 'been', 'done', 'better', 'Porky', 'movies', 'National', 'Lampoons', 'Animal', 'House', 'Now', 'review', 'left', 'out', 'few', 'people', 'two', 'missed', 'know', 'are', 'Stifler', 'Seann', 'William', 'Scott', 'Jim', 'dad', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'basicly', 'steal', 'movie', 'Stiflers', 'pale', 'ale', 'scene', 'fame', 'type', 'stuff', 'Jim', 'dad', 'giving', 'Jim', 'little', 'chat', 'sex', 'embarassingly', 'funny', 'Stifler', 'getting', 'revenge', 'Finch', 'real', 'gross', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'laughing', 'way', 'Finch', 'got', 'back', 'Stifler', 'end', 'was', 'probably', 'one', 'worse', 'things', 'could', 'do', 'guy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'say', 'much', 'else', 'movie', 'most', 'have', 'see', 'review', 'movie', 'justice', 'So', 'like', 'laugh', 'take', 'hour', 'half', 'day', 'check', 'out', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'film', 'deal', 'movie', 'already', 'been', 'made', 'millions', 'homes', 'world', 'nothing', 'can', 'do', 'not', 'getting', 'money', 'back', 'saw', 'theaters', 'ca', ""n't"", 'return', 'bought', 'dvd', 'have', 'accept', 'fact', 'Hollywood', 'will', 'be', 'making', 'more', 'movies', 'down', 'line', 'make', 'pay', 'watch', 'laugh', 'go', 'home', 'get', 'money', 'see', 'movie', 'tv', 'do', 'what', 'do', 'when', 'see', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Ex', 'phony', 'religous', 'shows', 'networks', 'Jerry', 'Farwell', 'change', 'channel']",N/A

His mother says ""sweet dreams"" and ""good night"" wanting a kiss on the cheek. She didn't notice what he was doing. Then she notices the television. He tells her it is just a nature program.

They could have spared us a lot of agony by just having people pay to come and see that scene and then leave, because the plot line was remanufactured, overused and only funny if you are one of those people who believes that Elvis is still alive.

It isn't as hilarious as &quot;Porky's&quot; or as disgusting as your average John Waters flick.  It  is instead a pretty run-of-the-mill look at the eternal quest of high  schoolers to get laid on prom night.Taken in this context, the movie  is a pretty solid effort.  Jason Biggs is decent as an indecently-stupid  senior doomed to get caught in the most embarassing situations known to  man, whether by his parents, friends, or the entire town via Internet.  Chris Klein is his sensitive dumb jock friend who needs to play down the  sensitivity a bit if he wants to appear less effeminate on celluloid (a  good thing for a heterosexual lead role, Kevin Spacey call your office).  Mena Suvari is the virginal object of his affection, while Allison Hannigan  is simply worthless as a repugnant band chick.There are a number of  funny situations along the way, but &quot;American Pie&quot; simply does  not sustain the laughter throughout the film and the climax (as could be  expected the first time) is a letdown.  The pie scene of the title isn't  any funnier nor more disturbing in the uncut version, which of course leads  you to wonder why the censors even bothered in the first place.An  inconsequential movie good for a few sophomoric laughs.  3 stars mainly for  the lovely Mena Suvari.",3,Overrated but worthy homage to &quot;Porky's&quot; series,958953600,"05 22, 2000",2000,1402,"['OK', 'people', 'take', 'breath', 'quot', 'American', 'Pie', 'quot', 'hysterically', 'funny', 'hideously', 'raunchy', ""n't"", 'as', 'hilarious', 'quot', 'Porky', 'quot', 'as', 'disgusting', 'average', 'John', 'Waters', 'flick', 'instead', 'pretty', 'run-of-the-mill', 'look', 'eternal', 'quest', 'high', 'schoolers', 'get', 'laid', 'prom', 'night.Taken', 'context', 'movie', 'pretty', 'solid', 'effort', 'Jason', 'Biggs', 'decent', 'indecently-stupid', 'senior', 'doomed', 'get', 'caught', 'most', 'embarassing', 'situations', 'known', 'man', 'parents', 'friends', 'entire', 'town', 'Internet', 'Chris', 'Klein', 'sensitive', 'dumb', 'jock', 'friend', 'who', 'play', 'down', 'sensitivity', 'bit', 'appear', 'less', 'effeminate', 'celluloid', 'good', 'thing', 'heterosexual', 'lead', 'role', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'call', 'office', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'virginal', 'object', 'affection', 'Allison', 'Hannigan', 'simply', 'worthless', 'repugnant', 'band', 'are', 'number', 'funny', 'situations', 'way', 'quot', 'American', 'Pie', 'quot', 'simply', 'not', 'sustain', 'laughter', 'film', 'climax', 'could', 'be', 'expected', 'first', 'time', 'letdown', 'pie', 'scene', 'title', ""n't"", 'funnier', 'more', 'disturbing', 'uncut', 'version', 'course', 'wonder', 'why', 'censors', 'even', 'bothered', 'first', 'place.An', 'inconsequential', 'movie', 'good', 'few', 'sophomoric', 'laughs', '3', 'stars', 'mainly', 'lovely', 'Mena', 'Suvari']",N/A

And after watching it you also must be warned: you will never, ever, ever under any circumstances eat apple pie again, so make sure you have a slice before you watch this laugh-a-minute teen comedy.At a high-school party, four friends Jim (Jason Biggs), Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas), Finch (Eddie Kay Thomas), and Oz (Chris Klein) find that losing their collective virginity isn't as easy as they had thought. But they still believe that they need to do so before college. To motivate themselves, they enter a pact to try to be the first to &quot;score.&quot; And of course, the senior prom is their last best chance. As the fateful date draws near, the boys wonder who among them will get lucky. More importantly, do they really want to do it at all?To get the flaws over and done with; Natasha Lyonne is underused, and it is a shame because she is by far the most interesting character in the movie, she has some great quotable parts in the script (""It's not space shuttle launch, it's sex""; ""I like to keep my options open"") and hopefully, in the up-coming sequel, she'll get more time on-screen. There is also a largely unfunny toilet `gag' with the character of Finch, the scene totally steals from Dumb &amp; Dumber, and crapping scenes have been done much funnier and much better. Okay, back to the good stuff, the cast is fantastic, Biggs is a great find (unfortunately he kind of ruined his career with some dumb comedies after he invested the part of Jim), Klein is sensitive and believably hip, while the chick-a-dee's like Mena Suvari, Tara Reid and ultimately Buffy's Alyson Hannigan, who manages to steal the entire film with only one line.

The 'EWWWWWW!' moments were subtle and far between enough that they didn't completely overwhelm the movie, and screamingly funny just from the situations the characters had got themselves into.The basic premise is beautifully simple: after being taunted by a supposedly more experienced classmate, our four young heroes set out to lose their virginity by prom night. Each of them is a distinct character, and they go about their mission in interestingly different ways. My favourite, I think, was the lacrosse-playing jock who joined the choir, discovered a talent he never knew he had, and managed to fall in love along the way. In fact, I think there might actually, Powers That Be forbid it, be some lessons to be learned from this movie!Such considerations aside, the movie is just generally hilarious. My nomination for funniest character was the computer nerd's father, whose bumbling attempts to talk to his son about sex will strike a chord with many. Show the scenes with him to your parents as a shining example of what NOT to do. The girl who acts in a sort of advisory capacity to the boys is enjoyable to watch too, as the sane, wise one amid a sea of reckless abandon.Another thing I enjoyed was to see two of the actresses in roles rather different to the ones they are identified with. Mena Suvari (the alluring Lolita-type from American Beauty) plays a nice normal choirgirl, while Alyson Hannigan's (Willow from Buffy: The Vampire Slayer) character's antics 'one time, at band camp' would have Giles coughing his tea all over the place in shock.A great laugh, and sure to amuse anyone who remembers what it's like to be a teenager.",4,"Sex, Pies and Webcams!",980294400,"01 24, 2001",2001,1719,"[""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'gross-out', 'humour', 'yet', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'film', ""'EWWWWWW"", 'moments', 'were', 'subtle', 'far', 'enough', 'did', ""n't"", 'completely', 'overwhelm', 'movie', 'screamingly', 'funny', 'just', 'situations', 'characters', 'had', 'got', 'into.The', 'basic', 'premise', 'beautifully', 'simple', 'being', 'taunted', 'supposedly', 'more', 'experienced', 'classmate', 'four', 'young', 'heroes', 'set', 'out', 'lose', 'virginity', 'prom', 'night', 'distinct', 'character', 'go', 'mission', 'interestingly', 'different', 'ways', 'My', 'favourite', 'think', 'was', 'lacrosse-playing', 'jock', 'who', 'joined', 'choir', 'discovered', 'talent', 'never', 'knew', 'had', 'managed', 'fall', 'love', 'way', 'fact', 'think', 'might', 'actually', 'Powers', 'Be', 'forbid', 'be', 'lessons', 'be', 'learned', 'movie', 'Such', 'considerations', 'aside', 'movie', 'just', 'generally', 'hilarious', 'nomination', 'funniest', 'character', 'was', 'computer', 'nerd', 'father', 'bumbling', 'attempts', 'talk', 'son', 'sex', 'will', 'strike', 'chord', 'many', 'Show', 'scenes', 'parents', 'shining', 'example', 'what', 'NOT', 'do', 'girl', 'who', 'sort', 'advisory', 'capacity', 'boys', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'too', 'sane', 'wise', 'one', 'sea', 'reckless', 'thing', 'enjoyed', 'was', 'see', 'two', 'actresses', 'roles', 'rather', 'different', 'ones', 'are', 'identified', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'alluring', 'Lolita-type', 'American', 'Beauty', 'nice', 'normal', 'choirgirl', 'Alyson', 'Hannigan', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'character', 'antics', ""'one"", 'time', 'band', 'camp', 'would', 'have', 'Giles', 'coughing', 'tea', 'place', 'shock.A', 'great', 'laugh', 'sure', 'amuse', 'anyone', 'who', 'what', 'be', 'teenager']",N/A

Now, I know that goes on in high school, but for  some reason, it just didn't sit right with me in this particular movie.  None of the characters were very developed, but maybe they weren't supposed  to be.  I'm tired of the bodily fluid jokes that we've seen a hundred times  before.

70456,A2MS6UV7ZGTMLR,0783241542,"K. M. Talha ""Weird Gurl""","[0, 0]","I'm not entirely sure why I decided that I had to see this film for myself, and the usual explanation of insanity doesn't quite work in this case. To be honest with you, when this film was finished, I wound up hating it a lot less than I honestly thought I would, although the content of this film still doesn't quite sit in my stomach too well. I had been told that American Pie was the best comedy of 1999 by various people, but the advertising campaign had led me to believe that it was just another film created by the sorts of minds that believe all human beings between the ages of 15 and 21 have identical motivations and personalities. While the film didn't quite go far enough to counteract this impression, it is entertaining enough to make the average viewer forget about the shallow characterization and enjoy the story as it unfolds. The story, such as it is, revolves around a foursome of male adolescents who are about to graduate from high school and step out into the big bad world of college and so on and so forth. Essentially, after being led to believe that the class nerd has just succeeded in talking a female into going to bed with him, these four teens make a pact to do the same before prom night, come hell or high water. The main characters are introduced to the viewer at a breakneck pace, and it takes some getting used to before the film settles comfortably in one's mind. In the end, most of the characters are relegated to props, with only Jim, his friends, and the young women they pursue gaining any real significance in the picture. Still, this is a better arrangement than some films I could mention, such as The Crow: City Of Angels.However, this is probably the biggest problem with the film, as the vast majority of the characters are never quite fleshed out enough for the viewer to feel any particular sympathy for them as they go through their inevitable humiliations and struggles. I also found it difficult to relate to these characters, as there was no real detail to their portraitures, which makes the changes and developments in each character that are meant to advance the story seem more like a change in hair colour than any genuine change in character. However, Jim (Jason Biggs), the character that much of the story is told from the perspective of, does manage to carry the story because of the way we see him change as a human being from the beginning of the film to its end. His father (Eugene Levy) also manages to inject a dose of welcome humour into the proceedings. Other characters, such as Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth), Michelle (Alyson Hannigan), Oz (Chris Klein) and Jessica (Natasha Lyonne) help to flesh out the story of the film enough to sustain interest. As entertaining as the film was, however, American Pie seems little more than an updated clone of such direct-to-video B-grade releases from the 1980s as Porky's or Hot Chili. Sometimes things from the past are better off remaining there, if you know what I mean.In any case, if you're after a quick, brainless laugh, then American Pie is a film designed with you in mind. It is crude, it is ugly, and it is shallow, but the comedic factor of the film makes it a reasonable way to spend ninety minutes. It is worthy of a rental, at least.",3,Want some laughs?,1105488000,"01 12, 2005",2005,3260,"[""'m"", 'not', 'entirely', 'sure', 'why', 'decided', 'had', 'see', 'film', 'myself', 'usual', 'explanation', 'insanity', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work', 'case', 'be', 'honest', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'finished', 'wound', 'up', 'hating', 'lot', 'less', 'honestly', 'thought', 'would', 'content', 'film', 'still', ""n't"", 'quite', 'sit', 'stomach', 'too', 'well', 'had', 'been', 'told', 'American', 'Pie', 'was', 'best', 'comedy', '1999', 'various', 'people', 'advertising', 'campaign', 'had', 'led', 'believe', 'was', 'just', 'film', 'created', 'sorts', 'minds', 'believe', 'human', 'beings', 'ages', '15', '21', 'have', 'identical', 'motivations', 'personalities', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'go', 'far', 'enough', 'counteract', 'impression', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'make', 'average', 'viewer', 'forget', 'shallow', 'characterization', 'enjoy', 'story', 'story', 'such', 'foursome', 'male', 'adolescents', 'who', 'are', 'graduate', 'high', 'school', 'step', 'out', 'big', 'bad', 'world', 'college', 'so', 'so', 'forth', 'Essentially', 'being', 'led', 'believe', 'class', 'nerd', 'just', 'succeeded', 'talking', 'female', 'going', 'bed', 'four', 'teens', 'make', 'pact', 'do', 'same', 'prom', 'night', 'come', 'hell', 'high', 'water', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'introduced', 'viewer', 'breakneck', 'pace', 'getting', 'used', 'film', 'comfortably', 'one', 'mind', 'end', 'most', 'characters', 'are', 'relegated', 'props', 'only', 'Jim', 'friends', 'young', 'women', 'pursue', 'gaining', 'real', 'significance', 'picture', 'Still', 'better', 'arrangement', 'films', 'could', 'mention', 'such', 'Crow', 'City', 'Angels.However', 'probably', 'biggest', 'problem', 'film', 'vast', 'majority', 'characters', 'are', 'never', 'quite', 'fleshed', 'out', 'enough', 'viewer', 'feel', 'particular', 'sympathy', 'go', 'inevitable', 'humiliations', 'struggles', 'also', 'found', 'difficult', 'relate', 'characters', 'was', 'real', 'detail', 'portraitures', 'changes', 'developments', 'character', 'are', 'meant', 'advance', 'story', 'seem', 'more', 'change', 'hair', 'colour', 'genuine', 'change', 'character', 'However', 'Jim', 'Jason', 'Biggs', 'character', 'much', 'story', 'told', 'perspective', 'manage', 'carry', 'story', 'way', 'see', 'change', 'human', 'being', 'beginning', 'film', 'end', 'father', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'also', 'inject', 'dose', 'welcome', 'humour', 'proceedings', 'Other', 'characters', 'such', 'Nadia', 'Shannon', 'Elizabeth', 'Michelle', 'Alyson', 'Hannigan', 'Oz', 'Chris', 'Klein', 'Jessica', 'Natasha', 'Lyonne', 'help', 'flesh', 'out', 'story', 'film', 'enough', 'sustain', 'interest', 'As', 'entertaining', 'film', 'was', 'however', 'American', 'Pie', 'little', 'more', 'updated', 'clone', 'such', 'direct-to-video', 'B-grade', 'releases', '1980s', 'Porky', 'Hot', 'Chili', 'Sometimes', 'things', 'past', 'are', 'better', 'off', 'remaining', 'there', 'know', 'what', 'mean.In', 'case', ""'re"", 'quick', 'brainless', 'laugh', 'then', 'American', 'Pie', 'film', 'designed', 'mind', 'crude', 'ugly', 'shallow', 'comedic', 'factor', 'film', 'reasonable', 'way', 'spend', 'ninety', 'minutes', 'worthy', 'rental', 'least']",N/A

70467,A152C8GYY25HAH,0783241542,Matthew Horner,"[1, 3]","To me, American Pie is no There's Something About Mary. Both are gross-out comedies, both had summer releases, and both made a lot of money. To think they are otherwise similar would be like claiming Danny DeVito looks a lot like Brad Pitt, only shorter.American Pie is a straight out teen sex comedy. Outside of showing a new use for Mom's apple pie, it covers the same ground most such movies cover. It is by no means the worst movie ever made on the subject. What makes a picture a hit with kids is anybody's guess, but maybe this one struck a nerve because, despite all our open talk and explicit images, sex remains a fact of life many Americans are uncomfortable with. The characters here certainly don't know what to make of it.The story revolves around a group of high school senior boys who vow that each will lose his virginity on prom night, if not before. There follows much stereotypical male and female behavior. Most of the jokes are based on the old idea that, at that age, one's hormones make the decisions, not one's brain. There is some truth in the idea, and the results can be humorous. American Pie's creators simply don't break new ground. They do use some situations modern teen's relate to. At the urging of his cohorts, for example, one boy sets up a computer WebCam in his bedroom to record his proposed conquest. Unfortunately for him, he accidentally links it to the computers of every student in the school, much to his embarrassment.There are some truly talented young actors in the film. Paul Metzler was the unlucky guy who opposed Reese Witherspoon in the wickedly funny Election. Tara Reid nearly stole the show as the dimwitted rich girl in Cruel Intentions. Here, their talents are largely wasted, and they are not much more than part of the scenery.While I was watching American Pie, I started to get a creepy feeling about these kids. It seemed like they lacked something. I decided that what was missing was passion. The boys pursue the girls - and vice versa - in an almost clinical way. Even the couple who forms the bond most likely to last seems lackluster. When one girl decides its time to give up her virginity, it doesn't seem to come from the heart. It's more of a calculated decision. Everyone acts like this rite of passage is just another in a long list of assignments that life hands us. These characters make the whole process seem about as thrilling as a science project.",2,"To me, this pie's not that hot",1016668800,"03 21, 2002",2002,2426,"['American', 'Pie', 'Something', 'Mary', 'are', 'gross-out', 'comedies', 'had', 'summer', 'releases', 'made', 'lot', 'money', 'think', 'are', 'otherwise', 'similar', 'would', 'be', 'claiming', 'Danny', 'DeVito', 'lot', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'only', 'shorter.American', 'Pie', 'straight', 'out', 'teen', 'sex', 'comedy', 'showing', 'new', 'use', 'Mom', 'apple', 'pie', 'same', 'ground', 'most', 'such', 'movies', 'cover', 'worst', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'subject', 'What', 'picture', 'hit', 'kids', 'anybody', 'guess', 'maybe', 'one', 'struck', 'nerve', 'open', 'talk', 'explicit', 'images', 'sex', 'fact', 'life', 'many', 'Americans', 'are', 'uncomfortable', 'characters', 'here', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'make', 'it.The', 'story', 'revolves', 'group', 'high', 'school', 'senior', 'boys', 'who', 'vow', 'will', 'lose', 'virginity', 'prom', 'night', 'not', 'before', 'much', 'stereotypical', 'male', 'female', 'behavior', 'Most', 'jokes', 'are', 'based', 'old', 'idea', 'age', 'one', 'hormones', 'make', 'decisions', 'not', 'one', 'brain', 'truth', 'idea', 'results', 'can', 'be', 'humorous', 'American', 'Pie', 'creators', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'break', 'new', 'ground', 'do', 'use', 'situations', 'modern', 'teen', 'relate', 'urging', 'cohorts', 'example', 'one', 'boy', 'up', 'computer', 'WebCam', 'bedroom', 'record', 'proposed', 'conquest', 'Unfortunately', 'accidentally', 'computers', 'student', 'school', 'much', 'are', 'truly', 'talented', 'young', 'actors', 'film', 'Paul', 'Metzler', 'was', 'unlucky', 'guy', 'who', 'opposed', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'wickedly', 'funny', 'Election', 'Tara', 'Reid', 'nearly', 'stole', 'show', 'dimwitted', 'rich', 'girl', 'Cruel', 'Intentions', 'Here', 'talents', 'are', 'largely', 'wasted', 'are', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'part', 'scenery.While', 'was', 'watching', 'American', 'Pie', 'started', 'get', 'creepy', 'feeling', 'kids', 'seemed', 'lacked', 'something', 'decided', 'what', 'was', 'missing', 'was', 'passion', 'boys', 'pursue', 'girls', 'vice', 'versa', 'almost', 'clinical', 'way', 'Even', 'couple', 'who', 'bond', 'most', 'likely', 'last', 'lackluster', 'When', 'one', 'girl', 'time', 'give', 'up', 'virginity', ""n't"", 'seem', 'come', 'heart', 'more', 'calculated', 'decision', 'Everyone', 'rite', 'passage', 'just', 'long', 'list', 'assignments', 'life', 'characters', 'make', 'whole', 'process', 'seem', 'as', 'thrilling', 'science', 'project']",N/A

Oz (Chris Klein) tries to hard with cheesy lines, and we he is himself, Stifler (Sean William Scott) and his rude ways screws it up for him even then. And then there is Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas), who is a little too sophisticated for his high school peers and has to lie about himself to hopefully get laid. As everything is going wrong for them, and time is nearing an end, they begin to realize that sex isn't everything.Man I remember when this movie came out and how much I laughed at the theaters... hard. 10 years later American Pie still holds up, but honestly it feels a lot tamer now than it did. A lot of movies now have pushed the limit even farther than American Pie did such as how American Pie pushed it farther than say Porky's or Animal House. The movie is still very funny though so don't think I'm saying it's not. The scenes between Jim and his father are still uncomfortably embarrassing laughable just like the first time. Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) is still smokingly hot also...hehe. And Stifler is still crazy and is still one of my favorite characters in the movie. I just love how non-caring he is.In the end I would definitely own this movie.

Forget what everyone says - the pie scene, the sex scenes, everything. The best moments of this film are the ones you have to really look for. And those are the scenes when you start identifying with the characters. Obviously I didn't identify with any of the guys (although I went to school with a few of them!), but I definitely identified with the girls. Not sure which one though, but some the scenarios I definitely related to.One of the best scenes in this entire film is surprisingly NOT the pie scene (I cannot stand to watch that), but the scenes with Chris Klein (Oz) & Mena Suvari (Heather). There is a real connection between their characters, especially during their sex scenes at the end.Stifler is the best character in this film, and he's so funny. (Except with the pale ale - cringe!) Seann William Scott really did well from this film, and hasn't been sterotyped too much - unlike Jason Biggs.This is not your typical teen movie.

70475,AZI0O32W4ZYGH,0783241542,"Michael Gordon ""Michael Gordon""","[1, 3]","When American Pie came out, many saw it due to its explicit focus on sex.  It was a coming of age movie, but its focus certainly was on a recent new phenomena that has grown: many young boys have been willing to focus on having sex and accomplish it in any possible way.  The tale of four boys who make a ""deal"" to get laid sounds a bit strange considering that 1) there is no way to authenticate that such an event has transpired; 2) typically, sex is a private matter, and why would you want anyone else to know what you've been doing?Of course men and women have spoken about sex to their peers since human civilization began.  What changes this is that instead of talking about what is occuring presently, this film focuses on future sexual behavior.  There's a deal to make it happen, which is a bit odd.  I think the problem with the film is that by focusing on sex to the exclusion of anything else, it showcases how superficial our generation has become.Although I did like the film, and thought many parts of it were funny, I couldn't help but feel a bit creepy about the idea of telling a friends that I would be making this deal to make sure that I would have sex before the end of the summer.  Sex is an emotional connection with someone else, and to rush it simply to keep a deal going is a bit bizarre.Perhaps the most interesting character in the film is Jim's dad, who just happens to enter into each scene at the worst possible moment.  He enters the scene usually when sex is about to happen, thus complicating Jim's life.

I thought something that had quickly become the Porky's for the 90s/00s was nothing but trash, but I was pleasently surprised.  Underneith all the smut and bathroom humor had a few messages and some cleverness about it.Four high school friends, Jim, Finch, Kevin and Oz, make a pact that they will loose their virginity by the end of their high school careers and start their college years as worldly, sophisticated men.  They plot and scheme to attempt to get any girl in the sack by prom night, making for some hilarious antics and situations.  Oz is perhaps the most ernest of the group, who seems like a genuinely nice guy albeit a little dim.  Finch, the suave sophisticate, is the most intellectual and likely to win a woman over with his charms, who is a bit of a wild card as he seems the least likely to have the challenge beore him.  Kevin is the only one in a relationship, but he is the weaker, beta male who is hoping for the day his girlfriend (party girl Tara Reid) feels ready to take the plunge.  And of course Jim, the main character, the happy bumbling fool everyman who just wants to be cool enough and be liked.  In addition to the four is Stiffler, the devilish, super smutty, super arrogant imp who leads all of them down a road of bing drinking and foul language.Besides their hilarious mishaps and physical comedy, this movie has an odd message about peer pressure.  Because the main characters were boys, once the boys achieve their goal they are to be pat on the back and told that they are heros.  Had they been girls, it would have been another story.  We do not see the guilt, the unsure feelings, or the fears.  Although I was one of those oddballs who made it through high school with my virginity intact, through them we see the social pressures that kids are subjected to become sexually active.  I felt that pressure, to be sure, but I was too unsure of myself and afraid to do anything about it.  And once it happens, it's not such a big deal.  And it becomes fun, but like everything else it doesn't become fun without practice.It's a little ironic that the star of the show was not any of them but the band camp geek who takes advantage of Jim.  The gal who on the surface seems so innocent but is the most cunning and worldly of them all.

I had started a new job at the time and was unable to watch it because I had to go to bed in order to get up by 7:30 am. It was a week night and my roommate had some friends over. They laughed so much and so loud that I was unable to sleep. I had a hatred toward the movie because of this. As I laid in my bed with a pillow over my head, I thought how funny could that damn movie possibly be!! I know it's a silly reason for me to not have watched the movie till now, but I was so bias due to a nights sleep lost right before starting that new job. So now nearly 5 years later, and after seeing the 2 sequels, I brought myself to buy the unrated version. I now know why they were laughing so loud. It's not only funny but well written with great characters.  So even tho I got to know the characters in AP2 and American Wedding, it was nice to rewind and see where it all started. And yes once again it was dumb of me to blame such a cool flick, but I still think my roommate was rude. He knew I had to get up early.

American Pie has some of the most Hilarous moments I have ever seen on film. You actually find yourself feeling embarssed when you watch the mishaps that happen to the lead character Jim and his buddies. This movie is about four friends who are in their senior year of high school... Jim ( biggs) is thoroughly obsessed with sex, a fact of which his parents discover when they catch him jacking off with a gym sock while watching scrambled pay-per-view porn. Jim's buddies Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas), Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas), and Oz (Chris Klein) are also aching to be devirginized, so they all make a pledge a pact if you will they will have sex with a woman in the three weeks before senior prom or die trying. Kevin appears to be to have the luck, since he already has a girlfriend, Vicky (Tara Reid),But do they want the same thing kevin wants to get it on vicky wants i love you yous. Oz is a good-looking jock who is a nice guy he has his heart set on a nice girl, Heather (Mena Suvari), who does not seem the type to rush into the things which may put a break on Oz's plan. Finch has no immediate prospects, he is the nerd of the group but soon a rumor is being told about finch and suddenly every girl wants to know if those rumors about him are true. But Jim is a truly hopeless case he falls for a beautiful exchange student Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) he tries to seduce Nadia but ends up making a complete fool out of himself. So he ends up going to the prom with Michelle (Alyson Hannigan), an annoyingly chatty band geek who doesn't stop talking about band camp. But she rocks Jims world with a story of her flute and shows him you can't judge by a book by it's cover. This movie is a must for any comedy fan.It also has the most funny line by Alyson Hannigan.

They decide to make a pact to lose  their virginity with the deadline being prom night.  At first the boys seem  to have everything covered.One boy joins the jazz choir in order  to get a date for the prom, and it actually works.  Another boy has the  girl of his dreams in his house changing.  A third boy has a reputation  spreading very rapidly about him, and it seems as if he will have to chose  between many women for the prom.  The couple seem to get closer as the days  go by.  From the looks of things, their vow would be accomplished.At that moment, their plan backfires on them in hilarious ways.  For  example, one boy has noisy dirrhea in the girls' bathroom.  His reputation  is destroyed from that point.  Another boy has himself and a girl  brodcasted over the internet, but a hilarious moment makes him the laugh of  the school.When prom finally arrives, the four boys will finally  lose their virginity.  This movie may have had some humor that some may  call &quot;offensive&quot; and &quot;crude&quot;, but that is what makes  the movie hilarious.  The script is well-written and the cast gives a  wonderful performance.  If you hate movies with lowbrow humor, I do not  recommend this film.  If you are looking for something the opposite, I  recommend it.However, there is one flaw with this movie, which was  the disappointing unrated version.  The tagline was misleading.  They could  have shown that movie in theaters.  It only included one minute of extra  footage.  If you rent this movie, don't waste your time on the unrated  version.  I guarantee that you will be disappointed.Overall, this  movie was excellent.  I would give this five stars.",5,This movie was hilarious!,964483200,"07 25, 2000",2000,1923,"['movie', 'was', 'most', 'hilarious', 'scenes', 'cinematic', 'history', 'laughed', 'whole', 'thing.The', 'story', 'concerns', 'four', 'teenager', 'boys', 'who', 'are', 'desperate', 'have', 'sex', 'Only', 'one', 'four', 'girlfriends', ""n't"", 'sure', 'ready', 'decide', 'make', 'pact', 'lose', 'virginity', 'deadline', 'being', 'prom', 'night', 'first', 'boys', 'seem', 'have', 'everything', 'covered.One', 'boy', 'jazz', 'choir', 'order', 'get', 'date', 'prom', 'actually', 'boy', 'girl', 'dreams', 'house', 'changing', 'third', 'boy', 'reputation', 'spreading', 'very', 'rapidly', 'will', 'have', 'chose', 'many', 'women', 'prom', 'couple', 'seem', 'get', 'closer', 'days', 'go', 'looks', 'things', 'vow', 'would', 'be', 'accomplished.At', 'moment', 'plan', 'hilarious', 'ways', 'example', 'one', 'boy', 'noisy', 'dirrhea', 'girls', 'bathroom', 'reputation', 'destroyed', 'point', 'boy', 'girl', 'brodcasted', 'internet', 'hilarious', 'moment', 'laugh', 'school.When', 'prom', 'finally', 'four', 'boys', 'will', 'finally', 'lose', 'virginity', 'movie', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'humor', 'may', 'call', 'quot', 'offensive', 'quot', 'quot', 'crude', 'quot', 'movie', 'hilarious', 'script', 'well-written', 'cast', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'hate', 'movies', 'lowbrow', 'humor', 'do', 'not', 'recommend', 'film', 'are', 'looking', 'something', 'opposite', 'recommend', 'it.However', 'one', 'flaw', 'movie', 'was', 'disappointing', 'unrated', 'version', 'tagline', 'was', 'misleading', 'could', 'have', 'shown', 'movie', 'theaters', 'only', 'included', 'one', 'minute', 'extra', 'footage', 'rent', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'unrated', 'version', 'guarantee', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed.Overall', 'movie', 'was', 'excellent', 'would', 'give', 'five', 'stars']",N/A

Schneider,"[14, 17]","I have seen it 3 times now, and it never fails to make me laugh from beginning to end, especially at certain scenes (like the infamous Internet scene).  I can't believe that Roger Ebert thought &quot;There's Something About Mary&quot; was funny and this movie not.  I finally saw &quot;Mary&quot; and thought it was more gross than funny.  I agree much more with Leonard Maltin, who says &quot;its values are old-fashioned, even if its sense of humor is not.&quot;  This is so true, and I couldn't have said it better myself.What makes this movie so much better than its raunchy predecessors is the following:1) It is extremely well-cast, from the hapless character played by Jason Biggs to the choirgirl played by Mena Suvari (who holds the distinction of starring in BOTH great &quot;American&quot; movies in 1999, &quot;American Beauty&quot; being the other one of course). Eugene Levy was THE PERFECT choice to play the father, and was a brilliant casting move.2) The story, while raunchy, is interesting, believable (very important), very well-paced, and of course, VERY well-written.  I still can't count the number of great lines that pop up at the most unexpected times in this movie.3) The film really DOES have its values in the right place.  Watch it, pay close attention, and you will see exactly what I mean.In short:  great movie, really funny, must see, must own on DVD.

Zwick,"[1, 1]","If you are a person easily offended by a film dedicated primarily to the glory of teen sex, you may well view &quot;American Pie&quot; as yet another in a long line of cinematic harbingers of the collapse of western civilization. If, however, you remember adolescence as essentially a period of unending coitus interruptus, you may well find yourself engrossed by this amusing, though admittedly crude, series of sexual and scatalogical gags woven around a plot involving the desperate attempts of a quartet of last semester seniors to lose their virginity on the fast approaching sexual armageddon known as &quot;prom night.&quot;&quot;American Pie&quot; gleans most of its comic energy from its outrageous examination of the crazy and innovative extremes desperately horny teens will go to in order to experience the thrill of sex in lieu of the real thing. An attractive, game cast helps to mitigate the crudity of many of their actions and the filmmakers' lighthearted tone encompasses the characters in such a cloak of affection that the audience identifies with, rather than condemns, their antics.As meager compensation for the moralists among us, the film does heavily promote the use of condoms and comes up with even more creative prophylactics for those times when a partner is not available.&quot;American Pie&quot; is certainly not for every taste and there are those who would argue that it serves a less than salutary purpose as a guide for already sex-obsessed teenagers. Be that as it may, the film provides a fair number of hearty chuckles for those of us who can find humor in a group of backward youngsters experiencing the frustration and desperation we have all, at one time, experienced.I do have one troubling question though: why do none of these characters, whenever they are involved in a potentially compromising position, ever lock a door? The answer, I suppose, is obvious for, if they did, at least half the film's biggest laughs would become impossible to achieve.

In &#65533;Pie&#65533;, a bunch of high-school seniors lament their virginity and, with only three weeks to the senior prom, decide to pursue a crash course that will land them a sexual conquest. Spurred by the improbable carnal triumph of resident dweeb Chuck &#65533;the Shermanator&#65533; Sherman, our heroic group resort to drastic measures not to be left behind by graduation. Our heroes come from all walks of HS life &#65533; with Jason Biggs as the brilliant if sexually clue-less senior, Chris Scott and Seann William Scott as the jocks (with Scott&#65533;s jock being the one with an undiscovered sensitive side), as well as a dark brainy type (wh may not even be interested in sex) and another kid (who looks suspiciously like Adrian Zmed) who isn&#65533;t sure if what he wants is sex or love. Given their diverse backgrounds (can you say &#65533;Breakfast Club&#65533;) it&#65533;s not clear why these guys have anything to do with each other &#65533; all these guys have in common is sexual frustration and some unexplained need to perpetually drive each other into ever deeper bits of mass humiliation. The humiliating moments themselves aren&#65533;t all that shocking &#65533; &#65533;There&#65533;s something About Mary&#65533; had more surprises than this &#65533; and by the time we&#65533;ve gotten past one particular second of embarrassment, we&#65533;re already on our way for another. Even the famous scene involving sex and baked goods comes and goes before you know it.  There are few surprises here, and the end shows a surprisingly touching resolution (admittedly one that shows teenagers having sex, something I thought was illegal). Before then, the flick is still a lot of fun, with Biggs being the lightning rod for most of what goes wrong, and long-time SCTV favorite Eugene Levy getting in some good bits as Biggs&#65533; befuddled father.

Vicki, who just wants to know that Kevin really loves her before they sleep together, gets in a brief fight with him that is immediatly stopped.The relationship between Vicki and Kevin is the major &quot;boy girl&quot; relationship of the movie, but the &quot;father son&quot; relationship between Jim and his father shines even more than that.

Replete with absolutely spot-on observations of the  sexuality of many American teens, the ultimate conclusions of the film are  pleasantly love- (and not sex-) centric.  What comes across in the end is a  work so hilarious that the responsible morals of the film aren't a bitter  pill.  Parents worried about the apparent PORKY'S-esque nature of the  previews would best be admonished to remember one of the central points of  the movie itself: you can't judge a book by its cover.Nor can you  particularly trust the DVD by the case.  `Unrated' doesn't really mean the  inclusion of so much new, sexy material-but `Special Edition' it certainly  is.  There are a lot of excellent additional features here, the best of  which is a particularly enthusiastic running commentary.  Including not  just the director, the commentary becomes a sort of reunion for many  members of the cast and top crew.  The consequent discussion is anecdotal  and animated.  One gets the feeling that it should've lasted for many more  hours than the film itself.",5,The best coming-of-age movie in a decade,960595200,"06 10, 2000",2000,1134,"['kind', 'modern', 'day', 'CANTERBURY', 'TALES', 'film', 'moral', 'places', 'ribald', 'means', 'Replete', 'absolutely', 'spot-on', 'observations', 'sexuality', 'many', 'American', 'teens', 'ultimate', 'conclusions', 'film', 'are', 'pleasantly', 'love-', 'not', 'sex-', 'centric', 'What', 'across', 'end', 'work', 'so', 'hilarious', 'responsible', 'morals', 'film', 'are', ""n't"", 'bitter', 'pill', 'Parents', 'worried', 'apparent', ""PORKY'S-esque"", 'nature', 'previews', 'would', 'best', 'be', 'admonished', 'remember', 'one', 'central', 'points', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'judge', 'book', 'cover.Nor', 'can', 'particularly', 'trust', 'DVD', 'case', 'Unrated', ""n't"", 'really', 'mean', 'inclusion', 'so', 'much', 'new', 'sexy', 'material-but', 'Special', 'Edition', 'certainly', 'are', 'lot', 'excellent', 'additional', 'features', 'here', 'best', 'particularly', 'enthusiastic', 'running', 'commentary', 'Including', 'not', 'just', 'director', 'commentary', 'sort', 'reunion', 'many', 'members', 'cast', 'top', 'crew', 'consequent', 'discussion', 'anecdotal', 'animated', 'One', 'feeling', 'should', ""'ve"", 'lasted', 'many', 'more', 'hours', 'film']",N/A

Even today, I still crack up at various scenes and soundbites. Of all the films that attempt to portray teenage sexuality, this one comes closest.Jim, Kevin, Oz, and Finch are four high school seniors who vow to lose their virginity by prom night or face eternal embarrassment for entering college without ever getting laid. Each takes a distinct approach to attaining this ultimate goal: Jim sets his sights on a sexy exchange student, Kevin tries to up the ante with his girlfriend, Oz works on his softer side, and Finch relies on the rumor mill. Stiffler, an obnoxious party animal, provides motivation is a rather annoying way, while Jim's dad is ripe with coming-of-age advice.The acting in American Pie is very well done, but what makes this film truly great is its comedy. There are several downright hilarious scenes (the most memorable of which involves an apple pie), and the different personalities of the male and female characters flow together nicely in the film. There are also many funny quotes in the movie that are not suitable to be posted here...many of which are provided by Stiffler (who has quite a talent using the F-word).American Pie is a very accurate depiction of high school life, but be warned...this is NOT a film for kids! The movie is extremely funny, but its humor is strictly of an adult nature.The DVD has some nice bonus features, including a documentary on the behind-the-scenes production of the film.
