Peschka ""Doug Peschka""","[3, 4]","I write this based only upon my recollection of the original airing of this movie in the 1980s, which I recorded back then on my VCR.I grew up on Fords, and remember my dad buying them almost religiously.  I was familiar with the product long before I knew anything about the man or his contribution to America's great love affair with the automobile.Over the years, I learned about Henry Ford's implemantation of the Moving Assembly Line in the manufacture of his Model T's, and his desire to manufacture every part of every car he made.It was this TV-Movie, originally titled ""Ford:  The Man and The Machine"", based upon Robert Lacey's book ""Ford: The MEN and machine"", that revealed a Henry Ford whom I never knew.Blended right along with his genius as a pioneering car maker, we are given Henry Ford's long-lasting open affair with a secretary 20 years his junior, his ruthless battles with his son Edsel over company policies, his antisemitism, and his early violent battles with unions.  The same car maker who made the work week much more humane by limiting workers to eight hours a day, and running his plant round the clock in eight hour shifts, allowing workers to have a life outside of their jobs, also battled the unionization of his plant to the point of blood being spilled in labor disputes.This film blends Ford's successes and failures, and juxtaposes them side by side, giving us a portrait of a man so conflicted and dysfunctional, we are left to wonder how it was that a man so troubled ever became so successful.My only disappointment with this movie is that it gave little or no mention of Ford's friendships and business relationships with Thomas Alva Edison and Henry Firestone.  These, too, were a vital part of Ford's life and work.Perhaps it is the very conflicted nature of Henry Ford in this movie that makes this film so riveting.  It should also be noted that this is one of the late Cliff Robertson's forgotten performances, which seldom gets any mention in most articles about Robertson or his filmography.  But Cliff delivered a convincing performance here of a gifted and talented and also conflicted man.  This performance is the stuff of Emmy Awards.If you are at all interested in Henry Ford, buy this movie.  And buckle up - the leaps from Ford's successes and virtues to his weaknesses and vices and back again will make for a wild ride through this incredible man's life.",5,The Henry Ford most people never knew,1315699200,"09 11, 2011",2011,2413,"['write', 'based', 'only', 'recollection', 'original', 'airing', 'movie', '1980s', 'recorded', 'back', 'then', 'VCR.I', 'grew', 'up', 'Fords', 'remember', 'dad', 'buying', 'almost', 'religiously', 'was', 'familiar', 'product', 'long', 'before', 'knew', 'anything', 'man', 'contribution', 'America', 'great', 'love', 'affair', 'automobile.Over', 'years', 'learned', 'Henry', 'Ford', 'implemantation', 'Moving', 'Assembly', 'Line', 'manufacture', 'Model', 'T', 'desire', 'manufacture', 'part', 'car', 'made.It', 'was', 'TV-Movie', 'originally', 'titled', 'Ford', 'Man', 'Machine', 'based', 'Robert', 'Lacey', 'book', 'Ford', 'MEN', 'machine', 'revealed', 'Henry', 'Ford', 'whom', 'never', 'knew.Blended', 'right', 'genius', 'pioneering', 'car', 'maker', 'are', 'given', 'Henry', 'Ford', 'long-lasting', 'open', 'affair', 'secretary', '20', 'years', 'junior', 'ruthless', 'battles', 'son', 'Edsel', 'company', 'policies', 'antisemitism', 'early', 'violent', 'battles', 'unions', 'same', 'car', 'maker', 'who', 'made', 'work', 'week', 'much', 'more', 'humane', 'limiting', 'workers', 'eight', 'hours', 'day', 'running', 'plant', 'round', 'clock', 'eight', 'hour', 'shifts', 'allowing', 'workers', 'have', 'life', 'jobs', 'also', 'battled', 'unionization', 'plant', 'point', 'blood', 'being', 'spilled', 'labor', 'disputes.This', 'film', 'Ford', 'successes', 'failures', 'side', 'side', 'giving', 'portrait', 'man', 'so', 'conflicted', 'dysfunctional', 'are', 'left', 'wonder', 'how', 'was', 'man', 'so', 'troubled', 'ever', 'became', 'so', 'successful.My', 'only', 'disappointment', 'movie', 'gave', 'little', 'mention', 'Ford', 'friendships', 'business', 'relationships', 'Thomas', 'Alva', 'Edison', 'Henry', 'Firestone', 'too', 'were', 'vital', 'part', 'Ford', 'life', 'work.Perhaps', 'very', 'conflicted', 'nature', 'Henry', 'Ford', 'movie', 'film', 'so', 'riveting', 'should', 'also', 'be', 'noted', 'one', 'late', 'Cliff', 'Robertson', 'forgotten', 'performances', 'seldom', 'mention', 'most', 'articles', 'Robertson', 'filmography', 'Cliff', 'delivered', 'convincing', 'performance', 'here', 'gifted', 'talented', 'also', 'conflicted', 'man', 'performance', 'stuff', 'Emmy', 'Awards.If', 'are', 'interested', 'Henry', 'Ford', 'buy', 'movie', 'buckle', 'up', 'leaps', 'Ford', 'successes', 'virtues', 'weaknesses', 'vices', 'back', 'again', 'will', 'make', 'wild', 'ride', 'incredible', 'man', 'life']",Ford

And I am intensely interested in the subject matter.Hard to believe this thing was made as recently as 1987.  To me, it has the feel of a B-movie from the 1940s or even the 30s.  Bad writing and bad acting.  I admit that I lack that nostalgia thing when it comes to film -- I want my movies all to approach the modern standard of being convincing and realistic.  I just have no taste for the hoaky and the contrived.  And I expect actors to be nuanced in their performances, not like amateurs in a skit. It just looks very, very old and second rate even for something old.  In my opinion, it is nowhere near as convincing or as appealing as, for example, ""The Waltons,"" which was a period drama depicting the same era.

Or read the newer Stephen Watts biography, on which the excellent 2013 American Experience:  Henry Ford is based.This sprawling 3 hour TV movie seems about right as an introduction to the quirky man that was Henry Ford, if you don't mind seeing scenes of a car assembly operation in which the primary work seems to be that of polishing the front fenders.Best acting award here has to go to Michael Ironside, who, as Chief of Security Harry Bennett,  was convincingly evil throughout.",4,Good introduction for a mass audience,1368230400,"05 11, 2013",2013,909,"['ca', ""n't"", 'add', 'much', 'excellent', 'reviews', 'written', 'eric', 'sorenson', 'left', 'bank', 'Douglas', 'W.', 'Peschka.Some', 'reviewers', 'here', 'wanted', 'documentary', 'business', 'Ford', 'Motor', 'Co.', 'not', 'that.Others', 'wanted', 'see', 'minor', 'important', 'relationships', 'Ford', 'had', 'other', 'giants', 'industry', 'what', 'are', 'seeking', 'read', 'Robert', 'Lacey', 'biography', 'Ford', '1987', 'made-for-TV', 'miniseries', 'based', 'read', 'newer', 'Stephen', 'Watts', 'biography', 'excellent', '2013', 'American', 'Experience', 'Henry', 'Ford', 'based.This', 'sprawling', '3', 'hour', 'TV', 'movie', 'about', 'right', 'introduction', 'quirky', 'man', 'was', 'Henry', 'Ford', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'seeing', 'scenes', 'car', 'assembly', 'operation', 'primary', 'work', 'be', 'polishing', 'front', 'fenders.Best', 'acting', 'award', 'here', 'go', 'Michael', 'Ironside', 'who', 'Chief', 'Security', 'Harry', 'Bennett', 'was', 'convincingly', 'evil']",Ford
