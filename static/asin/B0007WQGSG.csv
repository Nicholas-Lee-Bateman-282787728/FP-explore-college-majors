The problems with the show is that it tries that formula of mixing quirky family humor for the grown ups with cheap gags for the kiddies but it becomes just one big mess. Also, the children are pretty horrible characters, there's nothing to empathize with especially since they look SO modelled over market research. (Perhaps a comment of the shallow nature of the current video game industry? Unlikely.) They're just smug and self-absorbed but always painted as better people than the parents in the show. UPN's way of trying to be hip I guess. Patrick Warburton is the saving grace of the series and I guess there's a few game references in the first couple of episodes to validate your taste. In the end, nothing really memorable about this series.",2,Meh.

Many of them are familiar (Patrick Warburton, Lucy Liu, etc.), and the production quality is generally excellent.

This set of eight shorts, each the length of a TV slot, follows them home.If ""The Incredibles"" hadn't already done something similar, only more clever, this would have looked a bit stronger. Still, it stands on its own well enough, and the child characters (teenage Alice and tweenage Billy) are are given better roles. Alice's attitude, in particular, has a lot going for it.It has its clever moments, though. The CGI polygons are visible fairly often, reminding the viewer of the limits of 2004-era gaming hardware for PCs. The super-powered anime exchange student is good, too, as Billy's first crush. He's overawed when she flies him around, leaving a multi-colored trail behind her.  When she has to go back to Japan (the country), he's heart-broken.Dad:  You'll meet other girls.Billy, inconsolable: Will they shoot rainbows out of their butts?It's funny, entertaining, and thoroughly forgettable. So, if you have an evening you don't plan to remember, give it a shot.//wiredweird",3,At home with the video game characters,1174176000,"03 18, 2007",2007,1078,"['end', 'long', 'day', 'video', 'gaming', 'characters', 'have', 'go', 'somewhere', 'right', 'set', 'eight', 'shorts', 'length', 'TV', 'slot', 'home.If', 'Incredibles', 'had', ""n't"", 'already', 'done', 'something', 'similar', 'only', 'more', 'clever', 'would', 'have', 'looked', 'bit', 'stronger', 'Still', 'own', 'well', 'enough', 'child', 'characters', 'teenage', 'Alice', 'tweenage', 'Billy', 'are', 'are', 'given', 'better', 'roles', 'Alice', 'attitude', 'particular', 'lot', 'going', 'it.It', 'clever', 'moments', 'though', 'CGI', 'polygons', 'are', 'visible', 'fairly', 'often', 'reminding', 'viewer', 'limits', '2004-era', 'gaming', 'hardware', 'PCs', 'super-powered', 'anime', 'exchange', 'student', 'good', 'too', 'Billy', 'first', 'crush', 'overawed', 'when', 'around', 'leaving', 'multi-colored', 'trail', 'When', 'go', 'back', 'Japan', 'country', 'heart-broken.Dad', ""'ll"", 'meet', 'other', 'girls.Billy', 'inconsolable', 'Will', 'shoot', 'butts', 'funny', 'entertaining', 'thoroughly', 'forgettable', 'So', 'have', 'evening', 'do', ""n't"", 'plan', 'remember', 'give', 'shot.//wiredweird']",Game Over - The Complete Collection
