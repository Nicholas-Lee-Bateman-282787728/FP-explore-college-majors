Later, I saw it again because of the same reason plus I usually find Glenn Ford's films entertaining.  Also, Ben Hogan was a fascinating man and incredible golfer. The things he accomplished after nearly dying in a horrific car crash and are amazing and inspiring.The only probleml I had with the film was showing what a nice guy he usually was, and someone cared lot about what the public thought.  That's not true; he could care less. Anyone who knew Hogan, or competed against him, will tell you that. This is like the hokey William Bendix movie on Babe Ruth.I don't need all of Ben's faults pointed out, but went overboard in the other direction.  Even the great Hogan would tell you that.

It reflects the dramatic standards of 1951, however, and you just have to know that Ben and wife Valerie CRINGED when they saw some of the onscreen exchanges between Glen Ford and Anne Baxter.Hogan himself hit the golf shots for this film, and you can easily see how masterful he was.

Glenn Ford plays pro golfer, Ben Hogan and as usual with most of his films he fits the part perfectly. A reliable actor like Ford can make even a simple little film very entertaining. Anne Baxter as his wife, is too very good in her part. They have a very nice chemistry, and they are very believable as a married couple. One might notice that the prize amounts paid to the winners is very different from the millions paid today.
