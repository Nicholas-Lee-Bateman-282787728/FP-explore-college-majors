715524,A3C89D54IDGKV3,B00006G8K2,"Dev ""Dev""","[0, 0]",One reason why I rated it a four is because taking the sticky tape and its hard to take it off the package this one anyhow and it rips the Cardboard of the picture on the case & when taking the tape of something you purchased and it takes like 10 15 times to keep trying then when you do get it it comes off in sections that are inch a piece trying not to rip the image on the box so i can make it still look new Yeah should be lower rating. I like the movie I owned it on VHS when I was younger trying to get all my movies on DVD now or Blu-ray. What I disliked is getting the tape of the package is a little ridiculous and pathetic not like I'm buying it from a store buying it online so I cant steel it its uncalled for when takes you 10 min to open a DVD case. I would recommend this product to anyone who likes Christmas stories. But thanks for the product Amazon I know this isn't your fault its the manufactory / distributers.,4,Like the movie could be Packaged Better!!!,1360972800,"02 16, 2013",2013,933,"['One', 'reason', 'why', 'rated', 'four', 'taking', 'sticky', 'tape', 'hard', 'take', 'off', 'package', 'one', 'anyhow', 'Cardboard', 'picture', 'case', 'when', 'taking', 'tape', 'something', 'purchased', '10', '15', 'times', 'keep', 'trying', 'then', 'when', 'do', 'get', 'off', 'sections', 'are', 'inch', 'piece', 'trying', 'not', 'rip', 'image', 'box', 'i', 'can', 'make', 'still', 'look', 'new', 'Yeah', 'should', 'be', 'lower', 'rating', 'movie', 'owned', 'VHS', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'trying', 'get', 'movies', 'DVD', 'now', 'Blu-ray', 'What', 'disliked', 'getting', 'tape', 'package', 'little', 'ridiculous', 'pathetic', 'not', ""'m"", 'buying', 'store', 'buying', 'so', 'cant', 'steel', 'uncalled', 'when', '10', 'min', 'open', 'DVD', 'case', 'would', 'recommend', 'product', 'anyone', 'who', 'Christmas', 'stories', 'thanks', 'product', 'Amazon', 'know', ""n't"", 'fault', 'manufactory', '/', 'distributers']",N/A
