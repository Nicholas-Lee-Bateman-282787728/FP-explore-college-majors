1044020,A2MZIR63OO82RV,B000M7XRGK,"Dr. L. P. Zako ""Lebo Zako""","[1, 3]","Jamie Foxx does a great job of putting together some solid performers. He also does well not to try telling any jokes himself. I would have given this a 31/2 star rating if I could. It was all done professionally. We are introduced to some impressive up-and-coming comedians. Cedric makes a good host. He has his finger firmly on the pulse of urban observational comedy. He knows how to draw a laugh out of the crowd. In the next instalment, I hope Jamie gets Michael Colyar to host the show (""Yes, bring out the next M***F**"")The opening act is very good (I just forget his name). There are plenty of laughs all the way through. What is nice is that all the acts have the proverbial 3rd eye of comedy (a la Steve Harvey) and are able to introduce interesting and original perspectives. There is something in it for all. Be warned that there is plenty of cussing if that sort of thing scares you.Well done Jamie.

1044021,A3P1EB052N9Y90,B000M7XRGK,Jimmy R,"[0, 0]","Jamie Foxx should be ashamed for associating himself with this mess. Funny is funny, but this was just remedial, like an episode of BET's Comic View - You always saw the people laughing uncontrollably, but never understood what it was that they were laughing at, 'cause the jokes were never that funny.. It's like that here - corny and the same old racist and anti gay stuff, with a touch of god material to make it seem okay to the target audience.... I also find it funny that most black people scream the loudest about anything being remotely racist, but have absolutely no problem being racist or homophobic themselves (overtly or blatantly)..and just brushing it off with ""that's just how we do."".... Hypocrisy isn't entertaining, it's just frustrating, ignorant and sad.. Btw, the funniest person in this whole group is Bill Burr, and surprise, he's not mentioned on the packaging because he's white, and the powers that be in charge of the packaging at Code Black won't put anyone white on their cover - he's not even mentioned in the synopsis..",1,"Bland, boring, bigoted and beneath me",1400198400,"05 16, 2014",2014,1052,"['Jamie', 'Foxx', 'should', 'be', 'ashamed', 'associating', 'mess', 'Funny', 'funny', 'was', 'just', 'remedial', 'episode', 'BET', 'Comic', 'View', 'always', 'saw', 'people', 'laughing', 'uncontrollably', 'never', 'understood', 'what', 'was', 'were', 'laughing', 'jokes', 'were', 'never', 'funny..', 'here', 'corny', 'same', 'old', 'racist', 'anti', 'gay', 'stuff', 'touch', 'god', 'material', 'make', 'seem', 'okay', 'target', 'audience', 'also', 'find', 'most', 'black', 'people', 'scream', 'loudest', 'anything', 'being', 'remotely', 'racist', 'have', 'absolutely', 'problem', 'being', 'racist', 'homophobic', 'overtly', 'blatantly', '..and', 'just', 'brushing', 'off', 'just', 'how', 'do.', 'Hypocrisy', ""n't"", 'entertaining', 'just', 'frustrating', 'ignorant', 'sad..', 'Btw', 'funniest', 'person', 'whole', 'group', 'Bill', 'Burr', 'surprise', 'not', 'mentioned', 'packaging', 'white', 'powers', 'be', 'charge', 'packaging', 'Code', 'Black', 'wo', ""n't"", 'put', 'anyone', 'white', 'cover', 'not', 'even', 'mentioned', 'synopsis..']",Jamie Foxx presents: America's Funniest Comics

I thought Foxx was going to be in here somewhere. No such luck.  Cedric only cracked a couple jokes as the host.  However, they introduced some comics I knew nothing about and some I wasn't as familiar with, so it was cool to see fresh comedy.Donnell Rawlings: He was cool, but I'm getting a little tired of him constantly talking about Chapelle. He went to Africa. Please let it go.David Arnold: I love when comedians can make jokes about everyday events that most people wouldn't even think of.  I cracked up about his issue with the six-week rule after pregnancy, dropping babies, and vacuuming. He's attractive too, which makes him nice to look at while I laugh at him. His comments about work is how I feel every SINGLE weekday!Esau McGraw: I lived in Missouri for two years. All that hollering was not necessary, and it seemed so phony to me. I turned the volume down to the lowest level, so he wouldn't be screaming his jokes at me, but after awhile, I got so distracted that I stopped listening altogether.Louie Katz: White men talking about their Black girlfriends--the cultural differences that these dudes learn always entertains me. He walked a tightrope when he said the line about hair smelling like chicken though. The crowd stopped laughing at that one, but I know he meant no harm.  He was a pretty funny dude.Spanky Hayes: I always thought Spanky was funny on ""Wild n' Out,"" but I barely laughed at him here. It was a little disappointing. His jokes about dating White girls and bragging to the Black girls were funny though. He'll pick some controversial topics and meet them dead on. Good stuff.Tony Scofield: I loooooooooooved his ""One Man Riot"" jacket. I would be so happy to find one that said ""One Woman Riot"" for myself. I am a grinch when it comes to technology, so I nodded my head through his tech savvy rant. He's telling the truth. The hot oil joke was funny.  Put it on ""popcorn."" *cracking up*Willy Barcena: I laughed SUPER hard at every single thing he said. That was a funny cat. He joked about everything from male/female arguments, talk shows and a 800 lb. woman, to wrestling. Barcena is the best kind of comedy. It looks natural to me, like he's just sitting in his living room and talking off the top of his dome instead of onstage in front of hundreds of people.
