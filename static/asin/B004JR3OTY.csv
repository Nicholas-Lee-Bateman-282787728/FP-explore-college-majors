However, you cannot judge a horror movie but it's cover. 9 out of 10 times the movie will suck. Mask Maker is about a couple who buy a home in the middle of nowhere. A long time ago the woman who lived there was accused of being a witch and was killed by the towns people and so was her baby. Her husband whoses face was horribly burned saw the entire event, I might have missed something. Anyways, the man unearths a stick in the graveyard behind there house and the man is resurrected. If you're a person who needs to see someone killed every ten minutes, then this movie is not for you. It's slow placed but the kills are well done. The killer looks like the new Leatherface without muscles. The ending was a typical slasher ending and I guess there will be another part made.

Cheap costume store style face masks and usual cheap knife/hatchet effects stabbings.(2.) Not creative (you've seen this storyline so many times), time worn college students in a remote farm. The usual Native burial (never explained why) and the usual some sort of illicit child grows up to cause some bodily harm to some really dumb acting students. The usual towns folk have a secret about the previous occupant of the farm house which was, thinking she was a witch, they killed her with a Native spear (never explained why). One person survives, as usual, and we think the bad grown up child person is dead - but not really. Time for a cheap money making sequel.(3.)

First, he shows up in a Griff Furst movie. Then, the next year, he lands a part in Kill Katie Malone (q.v.). That he still has a career at all is down to his role in the TV series One Tree Hill. And to be fair, Mask Maker, while silly and derivative, is not as bad a movie as Kill Katie Malone; Griff Furst tends to be a director who gets attached to scripts without a single original idea in their collective head, but he does competent work with what he gets (and he's improved tremendously since the last feature of his I saw, the ridiculous Asylum mockbusterI Am Omega).Plot: mirroring at least a dozen other stupid slasher movies you've seen over the course of your life (or maybe a dozen you've seen in the last month), Mask Maker gives us the tale of a couple of college students, Evan (Colletti) and Jennifer (Love and Other Drugs' Nikki Deloach). Both are adrift, but have found each other; their relationship is long-standing, we are to gather from the opening scenes, but has never been stable. Evan, in an attempt to stabilize things, buys them a house--a mansion, really, an old plantation house he got an incredible deal on (in the way of college students, he never stopped to think about the ridiculous property taxes he will be responsible for come next April). A bunch of their friends appear in order to party, and unfortunately they all discover that the house was so cheap because it houses an undead, and seemingly unkillable, serial killer with horrible facial deformities who gets his moniker from his penchant for skinning the skulls of his victims and using their faces as masks.On the other hand, the fact that it is a dead-generic supernatural slasher film that is relatively predictable means that if you're in the mood for this kind of thing and you've exhausted your personal library, you could do worse (a lot worse, actually) than Mask Maker. Don't go in expecting anything but a generic slasher film and you'll have a good enough time with it. The problem is, most people will go in at least expecting some sort of original content. So let this review serve as a kind of gateway: this is a turn-your-brain-off-and-enjoy-the-ride movie.

So I was ready to overlook the townsfolk with secret knowledge of the house's dangerous past - the gathering of frolicsome young people at the house, ready to be picked off by the killer while they were in the act - and all the other formulaic plot elements that the ""Scream"" series does such a good job satirizing.But then things got really dreary. Leatherface, Michael Myers, and all the other killers in that tradition might have seemed almost superhuman in their ability to rebound. But the key word with them was ""almost.""

A viewer could justify the time spent watching these films with the ""based on a true story"" rationale. After all, Ed Gein was a real person who really did drape himself in human skin.But the killer in this film seems to rise from the dead. He emerges from a mishmash of supernatural shenanigans. So there's no way I could feel I might learn anything about the heart of true evil by watching this film. And so it lost me.""Mask Maker"" is well-photographed and has a few scary moments.

After Jennifer's (Deloach) boyfriend Evan (Colletti) surprises her with a new house for her birthday strange things begin to happen.  This is a hard movie to review.  It is not that bad, but it drags, a lot.  It's another haunted house because of something buried in the land movie that is not that bad, but it would have been a good ""Fangoria Series"" movie at an hour long, trying to stretch it out for an hour and a half really hurt the movie.  If you are looking for a decent horror movie that is a cross between suspense and a slasher, this is a good choice.  If you are looking for a very scary movie then I would go for something else.  Not terrible, not great.  I did like the ending though.  I give it a C.Would I watch again? - I doubt it.",3,"Combination of a suspense and slasher movie that drags on too long.
