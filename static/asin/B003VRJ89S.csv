1367747,A2A0E33DY456OX,B003VRJ89S,David Miller,"[1, 2]","The original Smokey and the Bandit is one of the greatest action/comedies ever made, but the franchise quickly goes downhill from there.  Part 2 gets kind of silly with Dom DeLuise and an elephant, and Reynolds' Bandit isn't very likeable in this one, but it's still Smokey and the Bandit.  Part 3 is a silly, convoluted mess.  Jackie Gleason is brilliant, as usual.  Big Enis and Little Enis, funny as hell in their small parts in the previous two films, are way overexposed here.....too much of a good thing.  Jerry Reed comes across as childish and ridiculous in his hero worship and subsequent Bandit impersonation...""I get to be the Bandit!  I get to be the Bandit!""  You almost expect him to throw an ""Oh golly gee willikers"" in there for good measure.  The best thing about the actress playing Reed's tagalong is the shot of her backside as she changes clothes in the car.  Other than that, she's horrible.  No chemistry with Reed whatsoever and she has no personality.  Now...for the four made-for-TV Bandit movies included.  I had never seen or even heard of these movies before.  Once I got past my initial ""What the hell is this crap?"" reaction, they weren't really bad movies.  Unfortunately, they weren't really good, either.  Brian Bloom is just too much of a pretty boy to be taken seriously and he just comes across as someone who would look much more at home playing some guy named Blayde in a daytime soap opera.  Basically, the new movies are just standard made-for-TV fare.  Better than watching paint dry, but not by much.",2,"All downhill from the original,",1332115200,"03 19, 2012",2012,1543,"['original', 'Smokey', 'Bandit', 'one', 'greatest', 'action/comedies', 'ever', 'made', 'franchise', 'quickly', 'downhill', 'there', 'Part', '2', 'kind', 'silly', 'Dom', 'DeLuise', 'elephant', 'Reynolds', 'Bandit', ""n't"", 'very', 'likeable', 'one', 'still', 'Smokey', 'Bandit', 'Part', '3', 'silly', 'convoluted', 'mess', 'Jackie', 'Gleason', 'brilliant', 'usual', 'Big', 'Enis', 'Little', 'Enis', 'funny', 'hell', 'small', 'parts', 'previous', 'two', 'films', 'are', 'way', 'overexposed', 'here', '..too', 'much', 'good', 'thing', 'Jerry', 'Reed', 'childish', 'ridiculous', 'hero', 'worship', 'subsequent', 'Bandit', 'impersonation', 'get', 'be', 'Bandit', 'get', 'be', 'Bandit', 'almost', 'expect', 'throw', 'Oh', 'golly', 'willikers', 'good', 'measure', 'best', 'thing', 'actress', 'playing', 'Reed', 'tagalong', 'shot', 'backside', 'clothes', 'car', 'Other', 'horrible', 'chemistry', 'Reed', 'whatsoever', 'personality', 'Now', 'four', 'made-for-TV', 'Bandit', 'movies', 'included', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'even', 'heard', 'movies', 'Once', 'got', 'past', 'initial', 'What', 'hell', 'crap', 'reaction', 'were', ""n't"", 'really', 'bad', 'movies', 'Unfortunately', 'were', ""n't"", 'really', 'good', 'either', 'Brian', 'Bloom', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'pretty', 'boy', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'just', 'across', 'someone', 'who', 'would', 'look', 'much', 'more', 'home', 'playing', 'guy', 'named', 'Blayde', 'daytime', 'soap', 'opera', 'Basically', 'new', 'movies', 'are', 'just', 'standard', 'made-for-TV', 'fare', 'Better', 'watching', 'paint', 'dry', 'not', 'much']",N/A

1367760,ANAYSRE3LX8GZ,B003VRJ89S,Micheal Hunt,"[14, 15]","Smokey and the Bandit has been in just about every mans collection of movie greats since it was made back int he late 70's. Bandit, Carrie and Snowman come together to attempt to bootleg beer across state lines due to a bet from a couple of rich guys. Everyone already knows the plot to the first movie, so I won't bother reviewing it more then what I have said already.The second movie seems to go 50/50 between fans of S&TB;, some like it, some absolutely hate it. Again, I've reviewed that one before, so I won't review it again, then of coarse comes the 3rd movie that was originally to star Jackie Gleason as both the Bandit and Smokey, but something went astray there and Jerry Reed was brought back in to play the Bandit, leaving fans wondering why Burt Reynolds didn't play Bandit, especially since he was there in there in the end for a cameo... but again, I've already reviewed the first 3 movies, and by now, if you don't know the first 3 are already available on DVD together, then you are not who I am aiming this review at. If you do own the Pursuit Pack, and are not one of the ""Smokey 1 was the only decent movie"", and are interested to know what the next 4 mini series versions are like, then put your ears on son.Bandit Goes Country - At first I was put off by the fact that this main actor is named Bandit, but looks much younger then Burt Reynolds... I was wondering if maybe these where prequels? Then I heard the names being used, and it confirmed this is not a prequel, it is set in 1994. It never was explained if this younger guy was supposed to be the same character Burt originally portrayed, but then I found out these where made for TV as pilots for a season of TV shows, but it never got past the pilot season, so what they are to me now, looking at them current day, I thought maybe it would be believable if I thought of this as Bandit (Burt Reynolds) and Frogs (Sally Field) son... even tho the maths doesn't work out with the age of this new Bandit, it is only a movie. Another thing that put me off was the choice of car, at first I really hated it, then I discovered it actually IS a trans-am, it was just the latest model... I would have preferred one between the years of 1977 and 85 somewhere, but I guess Hal Needham stuck to what he did last time and used the latest models.Anyway, the first movie see's Bandit and his best friend (Whoever that guy who played Leo in Charmed is) rescue a plane that is about to crash in a pretty unbelievable way, and then the members of the small flight tag along for the rest of the movie, expecting Bandit to take them to the airport, but instead Bandit heads home to his home town to do some really dumb things he is asked to do, and then try and patch up with an ex girlfriend. The first movie here I thought was pretty bad, but yet, it was watchable from start to finish. It wasn't exactly destroying the previous S&TB; universe, and it was nice to see two familiar faces from previous Hal Needham films, both being in previous Cannonball Run movies, and one in Smokey II (The Stuttering guy and Don-Don (I think he was famous once, but before my time) - I guess Hal Needham was a big fan of ""Blue Lagoon"" and ""Return to Blue Lagoon"" because he cast both male leads of those movies in this one. Overall, I'd only give the first one 2.5 stars.Bandit Bandit - at first I got goose bumps seeing John Schneider's name come up in the opening credits... John played Bo Duke, and the ""Dukes of Hazzard"" was based on the original Smokey and The Bandit movie, so it was nice to see them coming together... but then John started his terrible acting of trying to portray a hard-butt cop, and I rolled my eyes at how pathetic it sounded. The plot to this one is Bandit has an impostor who steals a pickup of a car of the future (yeah it sounds lame enough already) that is supposed to be unveiled by the governor, so Bandit and his friend have to go out looking for the stolen car that is in their stolen truck. Overall, there was some pretty bad acting and scenes in this one, still, I got to the end of it un-bored, so again, 2.5 stars.Beauty and the Bandit - Being a fan of National Lampoons Loaded Weapon, I liked seeing the lead chick from that in this one, but to everyone else, you probably think ""who cares?"" but this one here I don't think was based on me perving her out, this one actually wasn't too bad a movie. Bandit is supposed to be Grand Marshall at Daytona for a Nascar race, but doesn't make it due to his car being hijacked by the chick I mentioned. When he catches up with her, he ends up helping her out as she is involved in something that Bandit wants to help her out with. There is some decent humor in this one, and a bit of a touching ending. Overall - This one wasn't bad, I give it 3.5 stars.Silver Angel - Bandit's uncle dies and leaves him a carnival... however someone is harassing the carnival and trying to put it out of business for a takeover. Of coarse Bandit finds Angel (Traci Lords) a potential Bond girl, so he does what he can to help out the carnival and put a stop to who is behind the sabotage and crookedness going on. Overall - wasn't a great episode either, 2.5 stars.Overallsm Overall of the 1994 Bandit series... as I said, go into them thinking this new guy is the real Bandits son, and they aren't all that bad. They're not must see shows, but there is worse things out there. If you are interested in them, it's only a couple of bucks more then the pursuit pack, and you're pretty much only paying for the first 3 movies, and getting 4 extras for free, so it's not a bad deal. If you only liked the first one or two, then buy those on their own or the pursuit pack or whatever, but if you didn't like 2 and 3, you definitely are not going to enjoy the 1994 series.DVD contents. There are no bonus features, the first movie is NOT the special edition, part 1 is on a single disc. Parts 2 and 3 are on the same disc (not flip sided) and the four 1994 series are two movies to two separate discs and are not flip sided either.... oh, and no subtitles.",4,Concrete
