829341,A3MNJL4ROH6LRW,B0002B15IS,Don R. Holloway,"[2, 2]","This movie features Lorenzo Lamas as a Motocross coach who teaches kids how to ride. The film has a somewhat implausible script (a chimpanzee as a motocross star), but it does provide some good motocross action scenes which older kids will probably like. It also features great performances by child actors Josh Hutcherson and Bobby Preston. The major point of the plot centers on a race pitting the kids at the motocross training track against the kids of a nasty motorcycle gang. At stake is ownership of the land where these kids train. These kids want to win, but the gang's kids will do anything to stop them. If you are an adult, this movie probably won't appeal to you, but don't be surprised if your kids want to watch it over and over. It's just that kind of film.",3,Fun For The Kids,1316822400,"09 24, 2011",2011,773,"['movie', 'Lorenzo', 'Lamas', 'Motocross', 'coach', 'who', 'kids', 'how', 'ride', 'film', 'somewhat', 'implausible', 'script', 'chimpanzee', 'motocross', 'star', 'provide', 'good', 'motocross', 'action', 'scenes', 'older', 'kids', 'will', 'probably', 'also', 'great', 'performances', 'child', 'actors', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'Bobby', 'Preston', 'major', 'point', 'plot', 'centers', 'race', 'pitting', 'kids', 'motocross', 'training', 'track', 'kids', 'nasty', 'motorcycle', 'gang', 'stake', 'ownership', 'land', 'where', 'kids', 'train', 'kids', 'want', 'win', 'gang', 'kids', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'stop', 'are', 'adult', 'movie', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'appeal', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'kids', 'want', 'watch', 'just', 'kind', 'film']",Moto X Kids

It's just a good little movie about some kids racing to save the family farm and motocross track.  Lorenzo Lamas is servicable, as is Grizzly Adams.  The kids are cute.  The monkey angle is funny and I bet your kids will laugh.  The younger they are the better.This will make them want to either go outside and ride their bmx bikes or their dirt bikes or atvs.  And get a pet monkey.",3,Great for kids 10 and under,1154908800,"08 7, 2006",2006,493,"['reminded', 'kind', 'ABC', 'School', 'Special', 'expected', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed', 'just', 'good', 'little', 'movie', 'kids', 'racing', 'save', 'family', 'farm', 'motocross', 'track', 'Lorenzo', 'Lamas', 'servicable', 'Grizzly', 'Adams', 'kids', 'are', 'cute', 'monkey', 'angle', 'funny', 'bet', 'kids', 'will', 'laugh', 'younger', 'are', 'better.This', 'will', 'make', 'want', 'go', 'outside', 'ride', 'bmx', 'bikes', 'dirt', 'bikes', 'atvs', 'get', 'pet', 'monkey']",Moto X Kids
