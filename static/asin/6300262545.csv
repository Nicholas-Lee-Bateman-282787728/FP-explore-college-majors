230648,A1EZMV5DSWU8TU,6300262545,Draconis Blackthorne,"[1, 3]","Ayoung inheritor named Jonathan comes into possession of a stately mansion which contains many secrets, inclusive of those kept by his mysterious father, who said to be involved with The Occult, who ran his cult from within the recesses of his house.The movie begins with a scene of ritual taking place, complete with a huge Pentagram behind The Altar, and a Goetic sigil of Belial on the mantle, in which an infant sacrifice is to take place, which is actually that of The Sorcerer's son, because he fears that one day he will turn to the light and grow to overtake him. He commands one of the robed cultists to come forth with the infant, but she dares disobey, considering the horror of murdering a child; The Sorcerer enraged, telekinetically tears the heart from her chest. He then orders another member to leave his midst after an energy field surrounding the boy resists the death-strike. And so the kindly, though somewhat 'touched' old man sets to raise him as his own unto manhood. Upon maturity, he sets to explore the mansion, and begins finding elements of his father's legacy - in the library, books on Black Magic, ritual tools, personal artifacts such as several medallions, a conjuring staff, and a robe. Bit by bit his natural interests beckon him to experiment with The Dark Arts, with a cover desire to ""know what his father was all about"", whenever his newlywed wife bids him to be more reticent in uncovering the nefarious rites. But his curiosity drives him on - and then he discovers The Ritual Chambre, and begins making the necessary preparations which yields him almost immediate Power, most noticeable by his glowing green eyes, which in this case, denotes his oneness with The Forces of Darkness. His wife becomes increasingly frightened by his evilution until finally, she decides to leave when he devotes his life to the persuit of The Occult rites. But he invokes his two imps from a Magic Circle to do his bidding, and she is consequently under his complete control.Next, he invites a few of his friends to attend a feast and revery. Two fool-hearty stoners, a pretentious and 'cocky' guy named Dick {but you can call him ""Dick""}, and two vapid girls.But there was a purpose for them all being there that night beyond the mere dinner and party. They are all to take the place of those cultists for the Necromantic summoning of The Master Warlock. They are all placed under a spell, various imps {""ghoulies""} are called forth, and with everyone's united call, The Sorcerer is brought up from the grave located on the property, which displays a really nice gravestone with a Pentagram crowning it. Afterwards, the spell is temporarily lifted, and they are prepared by going down to the basement as sort of a party ruse, likened playing with a Ouija board for kicks, and Jonathan decides to open a book to conduct a rite from therein, but what they do not know, is this is yet another preparatory procedure to place them in the proper frame of mind of what is to come. A triangle is drawn upon the floor, and the ubiquitous ceremonial magician blindlight garbage of calling forth the name of jehovah in hebrew inunciated 'J H V H' {""joh-heh-vau-heh""} turning clockwise, but of course, the group do not take it seriously, and mock with such things as 'the hokey-pokey', and one of the moronic girls even screams in jest. Quite a pathetic lot. After waiting a little while, it is determined that nothing will occur, so they all decide to return to the kitchen for more beer and marijuana. Unbeknownst to them, the ghoulies appear in the conjuring trigram and are released to roam the grounds.Bit by bit, the 'ghoulies', which are essentially elementals, manifest one by one to cause havoc and spill the sacrificial blood until all of the guests are transformed into spechtrous participants in a hellish ceremony. The Master Warlock then sets out to reclaim his position as Prime Magician. First by entering the house with a mighty yell to stir the ethers, and one final sacrifice to bring him fully into the flesh, for at this point he resembles a decaying zombie - but with the application of a little transmogrification, a willing victim comes along - ""Dick"" - the strutting, boorish macho-man fooled by the Sorcerer's illusion of that of a beautiful seductress, followed by a deep kiss - the next thing which occurs, is he finds himself with a tentacle-tongue wrapped around his neck - and the next sacrifice is taken. So he is restored to full vitality, and heads straight to The Altar, where he reclaims his rightful place as Lord of The Manor.So father and son eventually come face to face - a memorable line spoken by The Sorcerer comes to the fore - ""I must admit you show promise, but at your age, I was much...better."" A line I know too well. The battle is on, and the son is defeated, as he slowly sinks into The Abyss, but is rescued surprisingly by The Old Man in full ritual garb, who takes over the battle, so he and The Warlock battle Magically until someone is victorious. I will leave it up to the viewer to discern who, for it is actually unclear.Considered a ""B-Movie"" by the masses, Ghoulies is highly entertaining, replete with occult themes, and quite comical at times, which makes it a favorite. Blackie Lawless of W.A.S.P. conducted a portion of the soundtrack for the sequal, which, in this reviewer's opinion, is not as amusing as this first film gem.5 out of 5 Goat Skulls.",5,Ghoulish

230649,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,6300262545,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 0]","Remember how in the 1980s, the success of ""Gremlins"" caused a bunch of filmmakers to spew out movies with similar weird-little-creatures-causing-havoc plots? Things like ""Munchies,"" ""Critters,"" ""Troll,"" ""Hobgoblins"" and so on?Well, I personally do not remember that period, because I was a very small child at the time. I have enough psychological scars from the stuff I DID see in the 1980s and 1990s.Sadly ""Ghoulies"" is actually one of the better movies featuring little mayhem-producing monstrosities... mainly because it was never featured on MST3K, and it has a very early role by Mariska Hargitay. The best way to enjoy this movie is by getting a bunch of your friends together, drinking heavily, and mocking everything about it.Twenty years ago, Malcolm Graves (Michael des Barres) attempted to sacrifice his baby son Jonathan in a gloriously over-the-top satanic ritual. But the baby was rescued, and a weird old caretaker (Jack Nance) decides to raise him.Now in the present, Malcolm has died. College student Jonathan (Peter Liapis) and his girlfriend Rebecca (Lisa Pelikan) move into the giant run-down mansion he's inherited, and start making themselves at home. But Jonathan finds his dad's magical paraphernalia in the basement, and he immediately starts practicing the black arts. Wow, he's suggestible. Imagine if he'd found a set of golf clubs down there.He summons two little people (not kidding) to be his minions, as well as a bunch of slime-encrusted hand-puppets (which are presumably the Ghoulies of the title). To gain ultimate power, he must do a special ritual during the full moon, and invites a bunch of his unlikable friends to help out at the ceremony... and die horribly. Of course, it turns out this is all part of Malcolm's evil plan.""Ghoulies"" fails miserably as a horror movie -- the titular Ghoulies don't even really do anything except make silly faces. Despite all the hokey black magic, pentagrams and zombies, it's not even slightly scary. Also, it has plot holes you could drive a truck through. If there a particular reason why the caretaker was apparently working for the Evil Baby-Killing Michael des Barres?No, this movie is best appreciated as a campy comedy, especially since Jonathan spends long periods of the movie summoning slimy handpuppets. The last third of the movie is an absolute cornucopia of over-the-top delight, especially when zombie Michael des Barres shows up -- suddenly we've got some bloody deaths and gloriously awful dialogue crammed with homoerotic incestuous dialogue (""Kiss me, my son!"").Oh, and the ending is a ridiculous cop-out that makes absolutely NO sense -- a Chekhov's gun pops up to save the day, and all the people who died bloody deaths are suddenly fine. No explanation! Don't ask!As for the acting, it ranges from hilarious to teeth-grindingly annoying (the guy who talks like Gollum). Liapis looks kind of like Kyle McLachlan, but pretty clearly doesn't have a shred of the talent -- he just does the wide-eyed ""I'm evil"" faces for the whole movie. Mariska Hargitay has a small supporting role as the only non-annoying friend, and she seems to be the only person who is actually TRYING.But zombie Michael des Barres... wow, his acting MAKES this movie. He is so campy that his head is about to explode -- and it is SO much fun. His jazz-hands alone make this movie watchable.""Ghoulies"" is a wildly awful movie in every way, but Michael des Barres' performance makes it funny enough to be worthy of riffing.

I have been a fan of Ghoulies since I first saw the original film and have been hooked ever since. Sure it is pure 80's B horror movie greatness which means what you expect it to mean. The thing is I love those types of films and always have, I can't help it. As most people would turn these flicks off I watch them on the regular. This of course being one of my all time favorite series of B horror films starting with this first film.The film follows a young man who inherits a mansion that was once owned by his satanic father. They invite friends over to break the place in and all the fun begins. But as time goes by Jonathan Graves (Peter Liapis) starts to feel the need to practice black magic after finding a few objects. In doing so he conjures up the little demons known as the Ghoulies and even his dead father. Now with all the power he could ever want and his father looking to take it all back what will happen.This is a low budget movie produced by Charles Band and the whole production is just awesome. It has all the bad acting one could ever hope for and even has Mariska Hargitay in a very pre ""Law & Order: SVU"" role. I have to say that I like the bad acting here because it fits. The low budget also gives us the low tech puppet Ghoulies that look excellent in my opinion. Directed by Luca Bercovici who co wrote with Jefery Levy this is one of those it is bad but it is good flicks. In fact it is just plain fun when you turn the brain off.Te Ghoulies themselves are excellent but I must say that they and the film itself gets better with the second film. I have to say that to be honest but this is still 80's golden horror on that wonderful B level. You have the classic 80's party with the very 80's music leading to all the horror no nos. This is one of those you either love it or hate it things, me personally I love it. I can understand if this isn't your thing, which is cool.

I love this random, stupid movie.Unlike most 80s horror, this movie wastes no time before revealing its slimy, latex monsters to us.  What's more is that this horror is somewhat kid-friendly (PG-13).We open with a devil-worshipping cult holding their quarterly white-hooded meet and greet.  Like cute, slimy little mascots, the ghoulies look on as the sorcerous cult leader's plans to sacrifice an infant are foiled.Decades later that infant grows up into a man and inherits a creepy Hollywood mansion, complete with a pentacled grave site, black magic compendia and a weird groundskeeper (Jack Nance; Dune, The Blob).  Jonathan Graves (Peter Liapis; Ghoulies IV, Wishmaster) and his girlfriend Rebecca (Lisa Pelikan; Lionheart) throw a housewarming party and Jonathan decides it would be a cool idea to perform a ritual and summon a spirit.  When this apparently fails, he becomes obsessive of the dark arts and persists until he successfully summons the ghoulies in his back yard.This movie is weird, neat, goofy, and doesn't seem to have a clear direction.  Later, Jonathan summons some two-foot tall dwarves.  Then he somehow compels his friends to help him with another ritual after an awkward dinner party.  This time he summons Malcolm (Michael de Barres; Waxwork II), the guy who tried to sacrifice him as an infant!  Random.  Oh, and Malcolm is his father.  More random.Sticking with the random theme, Malcolm strangles a guy to death with his super long tongue.  Malcolm also reclaims control of his ghoulies and intends to steal the life energy from Jonathan.  With this we got some black magic battles which are truly awful.  The terribleness of this black magic bouts is punctuated by blue and red laser special effects.The effects are weak, but quite entertaining.  The ghoulies remind me of Boglins--those rubber puppet toys from the 90s that were an odd mix of cute and ugly.  They're slimy, ratty, ugly and hairy, and they each have their own unique appearance.If you're looking for a good rainy Sunday afternoon horror that will bring some smiles, then toss Ghoulies in your DVD player and enjoy.",4,"Terrible special effects, but I just don't care.

What is Gremlins about? Mischievous creatures that multiply in numbers and wreak havoc in town. What is Critters about. Evil and ravenous furballs that wreak havoc in a small town. What is Ghoulies about? Some punk a** wizard(played by Peter Liapis) who wants to ressurect his dead father. My point exactly. Why have a movie called Ghoulies and the creatures it is named after are an afterthought(they appear in the movie 54 MINUTES LATER!!). It makes no sense. And they do appear they are limited to brief moments of screen time to cause mayhem. Before they appear the movie is pretty dull. Look, I know what to expect from a movie of this nature. All I ask is for a movie that's faithful to its title. If a movie is called Attack of The Killer Locusts then that is what I want to see. I dont want to see some backward wizard who is so much of a creep that he even attempted a ritual while spending quality time with his girl in the sack(what a jerk!).Ghoulies 2 and 3 turned out to be better than this snoozer so stick with those and avoid this slop.",1,Flush this movie down the toilet,1215993600,"07 14, 2008",2008,1180,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'hated', 'movie', 'make', 'point', 'clear', 'why', 'hate', 'movie', 'let', 'give', 'example', 'what', 'wrong', 'What', 'Gremlins', 'Mischievous', 'creatures', 'multiply', 'numbers', 'wreak', 'havoc', 'town', 'What', 'Critters', 'Evil', 'ravenous', 'furballs', 'wreak', 'havoc', 'small', 'town', 'What', 'Ghoulies', 'punk', 'a**', 'wizard', 'played', 'Peter', 'Liapis', 'who', 'ressurect', 'dead', 'father', 'point', 'exactly', 'Why', 'have', 'movie', 'called', 'Ghoulies', 'creatures', 'named', 'are', 'afterthought', 'appear', 'movie', '54', 'MINUTES', 'LATER', 'sense', 'do', 'are', 'limited', 'brief', 'moments', 'screen', 'time', 'cause', 'mayhem', 'appear', 'movie', 'pretty', 'dull', 'Look', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'movie', 'nature', 'ask', 'movie', 'faithful', 'title', 'movie', 'called', 'Attack', 'Killer', 'Locusts', 'then', 'what', 'want', 'see', 'dont', 'want', 'see', 'backward', 'wizard', 'who', 'so', 'much', 'creep', 'even', 'attempted', 'ritual', 'spending', 'quality', 'time', 'girl', 'sack', 'what', 'jerk', '2', '3', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'better', 'snoozer', 'so', 'stick', 'avoid', 'slop']",Ghoulies VHS
