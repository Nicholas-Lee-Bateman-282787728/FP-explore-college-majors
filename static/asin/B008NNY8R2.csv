I was disturbed by how the women were victimized.  But I knew that women would be victimized going in.  It happens in life...serial killers target women.  So I was enjoying the movie and then came the ending.  UGH.  Two hours I won't get back.  What a let down.  A lot of reviewers gave the movie good ratings.  You may like the whole thing.  Yes, there's a twist at the end but IMO it's not satisfying.  Ever since the surprise ending in The Sixth Sense, I feel like writers want to achieve that kind of &#34;GOTCHA!&#34; moment.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.  I didn't think it did in this movie.*****SPOILER ALERT****I don't usually put any spoilers in my reviews because if people are like me, I read reviews only *before* seeing the movie.  But I had to go back after watching this to see how other people felt because I was so let down.  First of all, it's one of my pet peeves when they list an actor/actress in the opening credits and they die within the first 10 minutes of the movie.  It's like false advertising!  While browsing through the movies and looking for a movie to watch, I had never heard of this one.  Julia Ormand gave the movie credibility for me along with Vincent D'Onofrio.  And then Julia's character is killed in the first few minutes.  I felt cheated!  Secondly, the end...since I saw it a while ago...was D'Onofrio supposed to kill the boy too?  Why would the guy off his wife and son only to get married and have kids again?  I know it happens...but was he having an affair with his second wife while he was married to his first?  They threw all of this at us in the last five minutes but instead of it being &#34;OMG&#34; it was &#34;WHAT?&#34;  &#34;HUH?&#34;  And then the police are supposed to just believe a robber came in and killed the father?

Good because everything about this film was well done, acting,script, etc. It was sad because you just feel so horrible for that poor boy . Don't be fooled by the cover of the DVD it really isn't that scary. As a horror movie i would rate this 3 stars because it isn't scary. As a thriller i would give it a shaky four. It didn't necessarily keep me at the edge of my seat the entire time only a few parts. The reason why i like this film so much is because it's twisted and sad and very realistic. The movie makes you have a lot of emotions and it's weird.

1571803,ADWQPR0LJD4J,B008NNY8R2,"ERSInk . com ""Eric""","[10, 11]","Jennifer Lynch's ""Chained"" is one of those films I walked away from completely disturbed but also captivated by. I find it hard to even call it a horror film because it doesn't fit in to the definition of the genre. A horror film to me is one that you walk away from with a sense of fun from being scared. There's nothing fun about ""Chained."" All I kept thinking the entire time I watched it is, ""This really could and does happen."" It's a gripping psychological thriller that throws in a few twists here and there to keep the viewer on their toes. Basically, it's exactly what you would expect from the daughter of director David Lynch.Bob (Vincent D'Onofrio) is a cab driving serial killer who picks his victims up and takes them to his rural house. One afternoon, Bob picks up a little boy named Tim (Evan Bird) and his mother (Julia Ormond) from the movies. He takes the boy and his mother to his home. After killing Tim's mother, he chains the boy up and tells him he'll be his servant for the rest of his life and his name is now Rabbit. As Rabbit (Eamon Farren) grows into a teenager, he realizes the only way Bob will allow him to survive is by following in the killer's footsteps. He must find a way to escape from the psycho before it's too late.The high-definition transfer of this film does nothing to keep it from feeling grimy and filthy. All the clarity of the picture does is give us a better view of the abhorrent and despondent world Rabbit lives in. This is the sort of movie you might wish still had film grain and muddy spots to hide some of the despicable things Bob does.A 7.1 surround sound mix brings all the horrific sounds you'd never want to hear to life. One moment you'll be immersed in dreaded silence. The very next screaming will make you wish you could return to the quiet place you were in before.Although it appears there isn't much here when it comes to bonus material, audio commentary from Director Jennifer Lynch and Actor Vincent D'Onofrio give insight into the making of the film and other captivating subjects. An alternate version of a girl named Mary's death is included as well. A trailer for the movie is also featured. It would be interesting to see a ""Making of"" featurette with footage of them shooting the movie in the house or on set.If you're looking for a fun horror movie for Halloween, steer clear of ""Chained."" There's nothing enjoyable about it. That's not to say it isn't a great piece of cinema. I've never seen Vincent D'Onofrio play someone so disturbing. I don't know whether I should applaud him for his performance or be scared he was so good at playing the part. It's a serious film you'll cringe at in several parts because of the horrific things unfolding in front of you.",4,"Blu-ray Review: ""Chained""",1349913600,"10 11, 2012",2012,2740,"['Jennifer', 'Lynch', 'Chained', 'one', 'films', 'walked', 'away', 'completely', 'disturbed', 'also', 'captivated', 'find', 'hard', 'even', 'call', 'horror', 'film', ""n't"", 'fit', 'definition', 'genre', 'horror', 'film', 'one', 'walk', 'away', 'sense', 'fun', 'being', 'scared', 'nothing', 'fun', 'Chained', 'kept', 'thinking', 'entire', 'time', 'watched', 'really', 'could', 'happen', 'gripping', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'few', 'twists', 'here', 'there', 'keep', 'viewer', 'toes', 'Basically', 'exactly', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'daughter', 'director', 'David', 'Lynch.Bob', 'Vincent', ""D'Onofrio"", 'cab', 'driving', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'victims', 'up', 'rural', 'house', 'One', 'afternoon', 'Bob', 'up', 'little', 'boy', 'named', 'Tim', 'Evan', 'Bird', 'mother', 'Julia', 'Ormond', 'movies', 'boy', 'mother', 'home', 'killing', 'Tim', 'mother', 'boy', 'up', ""'ll"", 'be', 'servant', 'rest', 'life', 'name', 'now', 'Rabbit', 'Rabbit', 'Eamon', 'Farren', 'teenager', 'only', 'way', 'Bob', 'will', 'allow', 'survive', 'following', 'killer', 'footsteps', 'must', 'find', 'way', 'escape', 'psycho', 'too', 'late.The', 'high-definition', 'transfer', 'film', 'nothing', 'keep', 'feeling', 'grimy', 'filthy', 'clarity', 'picture', 'give', 'better', 'view', 'abhorrent', 'despondent', 'world', 'Rabbit', 'sort', 'movie', 'might', 'wish', 'still', 'had', 'film', 'grain', 'muddy', 'spots', 'hide', 'despicable', 'things', 'Bob', 'does.A', '7.1', 'surround', 'sound', 'mix', 'horrific', ""'d"", 'never', 'want', 'hear', 'life', 'One', 'moment', ""'ll"", 'be', 'immersed', 'dreaded', 'silence', 'very', 'next', 'screaming', 'will', 'make', 'wish', 'could', 'return', 'quiet', 'place', 'were', ""n't"", 'much', 'here', 'when', 'bonus', 'material', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Director', 'Jennifer', 'Lynch', 'Actor', 'Vincent', ""D'Onofrio"", 'give', 'insight', 'making', 'film', 'other', 'captivating', 'subjects', 'alternate', 'version', 'girl', 'named', 'Mary', 'death', 'included', 'as', 'well', 'trailer', 'movie', 'also', 'featured', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'Making', 'featurette', 'footage', 'shooting', 'movie', 'house', 'set.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'fun', 'horror', 'movie', 'Halloween', 'steer', 'clear', 'Chained', 'nothing', 'enjoyable', 'not', 'say', ""n't"", 'great', 'piece', 'cinema', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Vincent', ""D'Onofrio"", 'play', 'someone', 'so', 'disturbing', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'should', 'applaud', 'performance', 'be', 'scared', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'playing', 'part', 'serious', 'film', ""'ll"", 'cringe', 'several', 'parts', 'horrific', 'things', 'unfolding', 'front']",N/A

It didn't kill the movie for me, but I would have really felt more empathetic for the boy and therefore been more emotionally connected to him for the beginning.But, other than that the visuals and directing were very well done. The director was working hard to avoid turning this into just another slasher. That's fine by me, I always think dumping an oil drum of fake blood is just a short cut. I kind of wish I had known what happened to the love interest near the end. It was one of those ""reveal"" surprises, but just too loose for me. It's a fine line deciding how much to ""reveal"" before a twist but this one just was a bit unexplained.But kudos to all of the cast, crew and filmmakers!

1571805,ANUJC77UL5SPP,B008NNY8R2,Francis,"[2, 3]","The big problem with this perfectly acted and directed movie is that the writing is so poor. As you watch each scene the same question will keep coming up: Why? Why doesn't the boy stab him to death while he sleeps or poison his food? Why didn't the mother grab one of numerous gardening tools off the wall in the garage and attack the serial killer? And so on.SPOILER ALERTThe big one though, which is never answered, is why does the father/husband pay his brother to kill his wife and son in the first place? One other problem is that the killer is supposed to be so strong that he can simply overpower any of his victims but he does no exercise, eats nothing but junk everyday, drinks beer and watches TV every night and slobs around driving a cab all day. In the final scene Tim kills his father but his fathers second wife calls the police claiming it was the result of a break-in. The problem is there are no other prints to be identified in the loungeroom but the family and Tim's which means that he would be found anyway. This then raises the question as to why didn't the police check out Robert's place when they were searching for Tim and his mother?We are expected to believe that the police wouldn't have questioned ALL the relatives of a missing boy and his mother. Not once during the time that Tim is captive does anyone come to the house so what this means is the serial killer and his hostage live in some kind of 'Superhouse' where nothing ever breaks down or Bob is Mr. DIY to the power of 1000. Another big detail that is overlooked is if the serial killer does NOT work for a cab company, surely someone would have noticed that a guy driving around in one of their cabs who doesn't actually work for the company.This could have easily been a 5 star movie if Lynch had of written her characters with much more of a sense of fight instead of simply resigning themselves to their fate. Either that or the serial killer could have used some kind of drug to dull their motor skills. Tim actually does fight back in an early scene but then instead of grabbing a knife or fork from the kitchen draw and stabbing the crap out of the antagonist, he just sits there waiting for him to recover.On the plus side, you will be absolutely floored by the performances of all of the cast as very few of the crimes are committed on camera but you do still believe that they really happened and at least Lynch didn't end this one like Boxing Helena with the dreaded, ""It was all a dream.""",3,Acting and direction = 5 stars but major plot holes lose 2,1356048000,"12 21, 2012",2012,2492,"['big', 'problem', 'perfectly', 'acted', 'directed', 'movie', 'writing', 'so', 'poor', 'watch', 'scene', 'same', 'question', 'will', 'keep', 'coming', 'up', 'Why', 'Why', ""n't"", 'boy', 'stab', 'death', 'poison', 'food', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'mother', 'grab', 'one', 'numerous', 'gardening', 'tools', 'wall', 'garage', 'attack', 'serial', 'killer', 'so', 'on.SPOILER', 'ALERTThe', 'big', 'one', 'though', 'never', 'answered', 'why', 'father/husband', 'pay', 'brother', 'kill', 'wife', 'son', 'first', 'place', 'One', 'other', 'problem', 'killer', 'supposed', 'be', 'so', 'strong', 'can', 'simply', 'overpower', 'victims', 'exercise', 'nothing', 'junk', 'everyday', 'drinks', 'beer', 'watches', 'TV', 'night', 'slobs', 'driving', 'cab', 'day', 'final', 'scene', 'Tim', 'father', 'fathers', 'second', 'wife', 'police', 'claiming', 'was', 'result', 'break-in', 'problem', 'are', 'other', 'prints', 'be', 'identified', 'loungeroom', 'family', 'Tim', 'would', 'be', 'found', 'anyway', 'then', 'question', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'police', 'check', 'out', 'Robert', 'place', 'when', 'were', 'searching', 'Tim', 'mother', 'are', 'expected', 'believe', 'police', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'questioned', 'relatives', 'missing', 'boy', 'mother', 'Not', 'once', 'time', 'Tim', 'captive', 'anyone', 'come', 'house', 'so', 'what', 'serial', 'killer', 'hostage', 'live', 'kind', ""'Superhouse"", 'where', 'nothing', 'ever', 'down', 'Bob', 'Mr.', 'DIY', 'power', '1000', 'big', 'detail', 'overlooked', 'serial', 'killer', 'NOT', 'work', 'cab', 'company', 'surely', 'someone', 'would', 'have', 'noticed', 'guy', 'driving', 'around', 'one', 'cabs', 'who', ""n't"", 'actually', 'work', 'company.This', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', '5', 'star', 'movie', 'Lynch', 'had', 'written', 'characters', 'much', 'more', 'sense', 'fight', 'instead', 'simply', 'resigning', 'fate', 'serial', 'killer', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'kind', 'drug', 'dull', 'motor', 'skills', 'Tim', 'actually', 'fight', 'back', 'early', 'scene', 'then', 'instead', 'grabbing', 'knife', 'fork', 'kitchen', 'draw', 'stabbing', 'crap', 'antagonist', 'just', 'there', 'waiting', 'recover.On', 'plus', 'side', 'will', 'be', 'absolutely', 'floored', 'performances', 'cast', 'very', 'few', 'crimes', 'are', 'committed', 'camera', 'do', 'still', 'believe', 'really', 'happened', 'least', 'Lynch', 'did', ""n't"", 'end', 'one', 'Boxing', 'Helena', 'dreaded', 'was', 'dream']",N/A

However, Frailty excels in story telling and also in another main way---not being predictable. Vincent D'Onofrio is very good at being a maniac and he does that perfectly here. That is in his blood I guess and yay for us movie watchers.This movie is about a mother and son who end up on the clutches of D'Onofrio, who did not expect a kid to fall in the way of his murder spree. Instead of killing him he makes him his slave and accomplice and that is even worse. The actor playing Young Tim was very good and so was Teen Tim as well. I think they were very good at showing the depths of emotions and slowly being broken but never completely falling under his spell. This is disturbing, sad  and bleak. And while it is a good dark thriller, it suffers from things you see coming a mile ahead. No, I won't spoil it, but as things happen you pretty much know what they are going to do--until the end. And what happens in the very end is not something I think would have actually happened.Nevertheless, it is a good movie. At it's heart it's a serial killer movie, bloody and violent. You only feel for the young boy. D'Onofrio may do small things to make you have sympathy, but no. I refuse to. He is lumped right in with all other serial killers--they are all the same. Horrible childhoods that help churn out adult males ready to take their revenge on the helpless, because they were once helpless never want to feel that way again. it's why they are so fascinating--and deadly.This will stay with you a little while after its over, mostly because it's so depressing. But it has good acting, and I even enjoyed the set direction, mood, lighting and pacing. Everything works to create a very desolate and hopeless situation for this kidnapped victim.

It doesn't take long to realize the nut hasn't fallen far from the tree. As the film starts, a mom and her 9 year old son are convinced by her husband to take a taxi...unfortunately for them, the cabbie is Bob, played by Vincent D'onofrio, the always intense actor who sinks his teeth into the role of a hack-driving serial killer. He takes them back to his house in the middle of nowhere, kills mom, and turns the boy into his personal butler/maid/slave. For years, as Bob brings home women to murder, the boy turns into a teen and is forced to clean up his &#34;boss's&#34; messes and bury his corpses.There's no denying the eerie, almost visceral feeling Lynch dredges up. Taking it's cue from European style suspense films, it joins such decadent classics as 'Henry:Portrait of a serial killer' and 'Bad Lieutenant' (1992) as movies so depraved, they make you want to take a shower immediately after watching. However, Lynch's film can't come close to those two when it comes to groundbreaking originality. 'Chained' feels more like an homage to such films, rather than the jolting masterpiece it aims to be.

This movie goes deep into the soul of a serial killer, played by Vincent D'Onofrio (Law & Order Criminal Intent's Goren). One of my favorite actors, he really steps it up in this role playing the misunderstood villain. Yes, I say misunderstood, for this movie centers around his life and victims, particularly one little boy he keeps.From the age of nine, Rabbit is raised by the man he knows murdered his mother, his existence allowed only because this man allows it. His reason for living becomes solely to clean the house, prepare food for the man, and speak only when spoken to. His life exists at the end of a chain. Still, as happens with stockholms syndrome, a bond is born.We see through a series of flashbacks what happened to the man that made him the way he is, and it is hard not to sympathize on many levels. There are many generational curses passed down that disturb his sleep, and now Rabbit's, nightly.As I said, this movie is not for everyone.

1571837,A2JEDX851ET4Y8,B008NNY8R2,"Pumpkin Toss ""Dearest""","[0, 0]","First of all I do SPOIL/ GIVE away information about the movie, so please be aware of this. If you are looking for a movie like Saw, Friday the 13th, and other gory horror movies, then this one is NOT for you.  It was an intense film, often disturbing, and at times scary. However, in this movie there was little blood and gore shown. What was mostly presented to the audience was an understanding of what the killer was doing, not only to his victims, but also the Rabbit character. On average, (SPOILER ALERT) the killer brought a girl into the house, and she would be crying/ screaming. He would then take her into the bedroom, and more screams, as the camera remained on Rabbit. Only later, as Rabbit cleaned up the mess, would you see bits and pieces of the mutilated bodies.However, do not assume that there were no graphic scenes, because there certainly were! One such scene included the killer as a teenager, and being forced to have relations with his own mother...gross!The one part about this film that I LOVED the most, was that the audience stayed within the killer's world, and rarely escaping it. Unfortunately, many horror movies spend little time within the killer's world, and the majority is consumed with a love story, a cop trying to solve the murders, and so on. In this film the audience knew little about what was really going on in the outside world. Were the police looking for Rabbit? What time of year was it? The audience, at times, could become just as disoriented as the Rabbit character himself.However, this movie was not perfect, and did have it's flaws. (1) I know that the scene about incest was necessary for the audience to understand how the killer became mentally unhinged. However, no way was/is any man/ teenager (I don't care how threatened they feel) going to get an er----tion and have relations with their own mother! No way! It was a powerful and disturbing scene (made me sick to my stomach), but very un-realistic. (2) What happened to the Angie character? Did she escape? If so, why did she not go to the police, and report the crime/ help Rabbit? Or was Angie chained to the bed/ taking on Rabbit's old role as servant? Rabbit kept her? This scenario would certainly explain why she ends up clean and sleeping on Rabbit's bed. (3) I loved the ending, and the role the father played in the film. The father's actions explained why the killer wanted Rabbit to follow in his footsteps/ did not kill Rabbit at the beginning. However, I did not like how Rabbit returned to the killer's house at the end of the film? He did not get help? What? I understand that Rabbit was suppose to be so far gone (mentally) that there was no way he could live a normal life, and he stayed in the house. However, this didn't fully work for me, due to the fact of how much help there is for these types of victims(now a days). Perhaps if the film was a period piece from a hundred years ago it would have made more sense? I don't know, the ending works for some, but it did not work for me.However, despite these flaws it was an excellent movie. The acting was believable, and the story kept me entertained. I would like to see more movies made like this one.",5,What you should know and more,1400716800,"05 22, 2014",2014,3189,"['First', 'do', 'SPOIL/', 'GIVE', 'away', 'information', 'movie', 'please', 'be', 'aware', 'are', 'looking', 'movie', 'Saw', 'Friday', '13th', 'other', 'gory', 'horror', 'movies', 'then', 'one', 'NOT', 'was', 'intense', 'film', 'often', 'disturbing', 'times', 'scary', 'However', 'movie', 'was', 'little', 'blood', 'gore', 'shown', 'What', 'was', 'mostly', 'presented', 'audience', 'was', 'understanding', 'what', 'killer', 'was', 'doing', 'not', 'only', 'victims', 'also', 'Rabbit', 'character', 'average', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'killer', 'brought', 'girl', 'house', 'would', 'be', 'crying/', 'screaming', 'would', 'then', 'take', 'bedroom', 'more', 'screams', 'camera', 'remained', 'Rabbit', 'Only', 'later', 'Rabbit', 'cleaned', 'up', 'mess', 'would', 'see', 'bits', 'pieces', 'mutilated', 'bodies.However', 'do', 'not', 'assume', 'were', 'graphic', 'scenes', 'certainly', 'were', 'One', 'such', 'scene', 'included', 'killer', 'teenager', 'being', 'forced', 'have', 'relations', 'own', 'mother', 'gross', 'one', 'part', 'film', 'LOVED', 'most', 'was', 'audience', 'stayed', 'killer', 'world', 'rarely', 'escaping', 'Unfortunately', 'many', 'horror', 'movies', 'spend', 'little', 'time', 'killer', 'world', 'majority', 'consumed', 'love', 'story', 'cop', 'trying', 'solve', 'murders', 'so', 'film', 'audience', 'knew', 'little', 'what', 'was', 'really', 'going', 'outside', 'world', 'Were', 'police', 'looking', 'Rabbit', 'What', 'time', 'year', 'was', 'audience', 'times', 'could', 'become', 'just', 'as', 'disoriented', 'Rabbit', 'character', 'himself.However', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'perfect', 'did', 'have', 'flaws', '1', 'know', 'scene', 'incest', 'was', 'necessary', 'audience', 'understand', 'how', 'killer', 'became', 'mentally', 'unhinged', 'However', 'way', 'man/', 'teenager', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'how', 'threatened', 'feel', 'going', 'get', 'er', 'tion', 'have', 'relations', 'own', 'mother', 'way', 'was', 'powerful', 'disturbing', 'scene', 'made', 'sick', 'stomach', 'very', 'un-realistic', '2', 'What', 'happened', 'Angie', 'character', 'Did', 'escape', 'so', 'why', 'did', 'not', 'go', 'police', 'report', 'crime/', 'help', 'Rabbit', 'was', 'Angie', 'chained', 'bed/', 'taking', 'Rabbit', 'old', 'role', 'servant', 'Rabbit', 'kept', 'scenario', 'would', 'certainly', 'explain', 'why', 'up', 'clean', 'sleeping', 'Rabbit', 'bed', '3', 'loved', 'ending', 'role', 'father', 'played', 'film', 'father', 'actions', 'explained', 'why', 'killer', 'wanted', 'Rabbit', 'follow', 'footsteps/', 'did', 'not', 'kill', 'Rabbit', 'beginning', 'However', 'did', 'not', 'how', 'Rabbit', 'returned', 'killer', 'house', 'end', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'help', 'What', 'understand', 'Rabbit', 'was', 'suppose', 'be', 'so', 'far', 'gone', 'mentally', 'was', 'way', 'could', 'live', 'normal', 'life', 'stayed', 'house', 'However', 'did', ""n't"", 'fully', 'work', 'due', 'fact', 'how', 'much', 'help', 'types', 'victims', 'now', 'days', 'Perhaps', 'film', 'was', 'period', 'piece', 'hundred', 'years', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'sense', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'ending', 'works', 'did', 'not', 'work', 'me.However', 'flaws', 'was', 'excellent', 'movie', 'acting', 'was', 'believable', 'story', 'kept', 'entertained', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'more', 'movies', 'made', 'one']",N/A
