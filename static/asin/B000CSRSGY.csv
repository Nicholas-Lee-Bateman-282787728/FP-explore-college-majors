This treasure chest of comic fun has 6 episodes including the Pilot episode.  If you didn't know how much humor could be found in Cleveland Ohio, you do now!Since there are a paucity of shows on this dvd, let's just say the market has been tested and we want the full series!  The Drag Queen episode makes me laugh until I'm wiping tears from my eyes and that episode about Drew's promotion had me laughing so hard that I thought I'd crack a rib.  This is what comedy fans have been praying for.  Please, please, PLEASE release the full season so we can enjoy even more laughs.  Drew Carey is here to stay!",5,Please Release The Full Season!

Drew's big promotion was the funniest though. I'll add a few more episodes to my library later. They are great to watch after a long day. After all no one has it as tough as Drew.,5,What a Gas,1308700800,"06 22, 2011",2011,292,"['Drew', 'Carey', 'rest', 'cast', 'series', 'sit', 'coms', 'were', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'episode', 'saw', 'Drew', 'big', 'promotion', 'was', 'funniest', ""'ll"", 'add', 'few', 'more', 'episodes', 'library', 'later', 'are', 'great', 'watch', 'long', 'day', 'one', 'as', 'tough', 'Drew']",The Drew Carey Show: TV Favorites Compilation

These episodes are pretty good ones, but definetly not the best.  Just wait for the actual season's to start coming out on DVD, then you'll see what I mean.  But this is ultimately a great purchase for any fan of the show, or Drew Carey for that matter.

The DVD contains 6 episodes, The Pilot, Playing The Unified Field, We'll Remember Always - Evaluation Day, Drew Blows His Promotion, My Best Friends Wedding, DrugCo. Great episodes but I would rather have a complete season. There are no extras on this DVD. I guess this DVD is testing the Market before they release the full seasons.

He was hilarious as Mr. Wick, but he's like, the worst talk show host ever (especially up against Conan O'Brien, who is awesome).  Sorry, but if you ask me, it's just not what he's good at.

Zuncic ""Scotty Z""","[1, 1]","Last Monday, September 15, 2008, The Home Theater Forum had Warner Brothers home video (T.V. and Animation Divisions only) on their chat line.  Questions about a release for the 2nd season of Drew Carey Show were asked and Warner Brothers flatly said ""no plans"".  I think this is a disgrace!!!  Drew Carey is one of the best Comedy shows of the 90's!!  We need to write to Warner Brothers and bombard them with emails and letters to get this show on DVD!!!  Fans of the series Knots Landing did just that, and now Knots Landing (according to last mondays chat) Warner Brothers is giving that show another chance on DVD! We need to do the same for this show if you want more seasons of this show released on DVD!!!  GET YOUR VOICES HEARD!!!  The good news is Warner Brothers is planning to release another DVD set of Drew's other show: Whose Line Is It Anyway? Season 2.

The show is very entertaining and I especially love Drew fighting with Mimi all the time. The other characters were also great matters really sorry to see Lisa go in the first season; I always thought she was hot.What you get with this disc is a handful of episodes which seem to be mainly picked out because they had some sort of uniqueness. For example you have the first episode, you also have the wonderful music video that they did, one that had an animated Daffy duck, and the one where they go to drug Co. to rescue Drew's dog. It's a nice little sampler plate for the whole series.If you can't get the individual seasons separately, this is about the best you can do.",4,The Drew Cary Show Was One Of My Favorites,1347753600,"09 16, 2012",2012,767,"['first', 'season', 'two', 'Drew', 'Carey', 'show', 'absolute', 'favorite', 'series', 'time', 'show', 'very', 'entertaining', 'especially', 'love', 'Drew', 'fighting', 'Mimi', 'time', 'other', 'characters', 'were', 'also', 'great', 'matters', 'really', 'sorry', 'see', 'Lisa', 'go', 'first', 'season', 'always', 'thought', 'was', 'hot.What', 'get', 'disc', 'handful', 'episodes', 'seem', 'be', 'mainly', 'picked', 'out', 'had', 'sort', 'uniqueness', 'example', 'have', 'first', 'episode', 'also', 'have', 'wonderful', 'music', 'video', 'did', 'one', 'had', 'animated', 'Daffy', 'duck', 'one', 'where', 'go', 'drug', 'Co.', 'rescue', 'Drew', 'dog', 'nice', 'little', 'sampler', 'plate', 'whole', 'series.If', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'individual', 'seasons', 'separately', 'best', 'can', 'do']",The Drew Carey Show: TV Favorites Compilation
