What it didn't show was the full picture. For me Freddie was a great showman, probably one of THE greatest frontmen, and in my mind, no band ever performed better to big stadium audiences.I personally could care less about his personal life, the hedonism of the 70's and 80's may seem shocking to people watching now in 2013, but I was always more interested in his music.Brian May said of Freddie that he was "" A Lover of Life, a Singer of Songs"" and these words are carved on his statue on the shore of Lake Geneva.Whatever you take away from this documentary, take it with a pinch of salt, and remember you have only seen about 20% of the full picture.",4,Mixed feelings,1357776000,"01 10, 2013",2013,2509,"['read', 'reviews', 'production', 'have', 'remember', 'most', 'not', 'writing', 'never', 'actually', 'knew', 'man', 'have', 'begin', 'review', 'saying', 'do', 'know', 'have', 'learned', 'watched', 'read', 'tells', 'very', 'unbalanced', 'program.Having', 'listened', 'music', 'very', 'beginning', 'been', 'fortunate', 'enough', 'see', 'concert', '1980', 'fan', 'seen', 'heard', 'read', 'too', 'many', 'articles', 'list', 'here', 'think', 'documentary', 'very', 'poor', 'representation', 'little', 'knowledge', 'man', 'band', 'may', 'come', 'away', 'thinking', 'was', 'absorbed', 'spoiled', 'arrogant', 'bit', 'jerk', 'real', 'shame.I', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'can', 'breeze', 'Queen', 'early', 'library', '5', 'minute', 'montage', 'then', 'spend', '15', 'minutes', 'talking', 'Freddies', 'sexual', 'proclivities', 'gay', 'scenes', 'New', 'York', 'World.The', 'program', 'focuses', 'most', 'part', 'Freddie', 'solo', 'career', 'attempts', 'disastrous', 'terms', 'sales', 'Bad', 'Guy', 'album', 'later', 'Great', 'Pretender', 'lastly', 'collaboration', 'Montserrat', 'Caballe', 'Barcelona', 'album.I', ""'ll"", 'make', 'personal', 'observation', 'here', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'spent', 'Barcelona', 'project', 'have', 'already', 'said', 'perhaps', 'coincide', 're-release', 'album', 'documentary', 'almost', 'advert', 'are', 'great', 'camera', 'interviews', 'lot', 'previously', 'unseen', 'footage', 'piece', 'Freddie', 'performing', 'Royal', 'Ballet', 'even', 'unreleased', 'collaboration', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'discussed', 'imagine', 'how', 'much', 'would', 'sell', 'today', 'was', 'dug', 'up', 'released', 'What', 'documentary', 'showed', 'was', 'what', 'complex', 'man', 'Freddie', 'was', 'almost', 'tortured', 'artist', 'opera', 'singer', 'ballet', 'dancer', 'writer', 'poet', 'lover', 'rolled', 'rock', 'star', 'who', 'times', 'fell', 'victim', 'own', 'success', 'What', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'was', 'full', 'picture', 'Freddie', 'was', 'great', 'showman', 'probably', 'one', 'THE', 'greatest', 'frontmen', 'mind', 'band', 'ever', 'performed', 'better', 'big', 'stadium', 'audiences.I', 'personally', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'personal', 'life', 'hedonism', '70', '80', 'may', 'seem', 'shocking', 'people', 'watching', 'now', '2013', 'was', 'always', 'more', 'interested', 'music.Brian', 'May', 'said', 'Freddie', 'was', 'Lover', 'Life', 'Singer', 'Songs', 'words', 'are', 'carved', 'statue', 'shore', 'Lake', 'Geneva.Whatever', 'take', 'away', 'documentary', 'take', 'pinch', 'salt', 'remember', 'have', 'only', 'seen', '20', '%', 'full', 'picture']",N/A
1570895,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B008N5UX74,Andy Orrock,"[0, 0]","This documentary sheds light on the life of Freddie Mercury, the late, great lead singer and composer of Queen.  While the legend of Mercury has always burned brightly in the UK (and, to a lesser extent in continental Europe), he remains a relative enigma in the US.  This fact was brought home to me recently when my wife and I went to see the Queen-themed ""Rock of Ages"" with a few of her co-workers, all of whom were stunned to find out that ""all these songs"" (that they obviously adored) were Queen hits.The surviving members of the band have been quite emphatic about the reason Mercury and the band isn't as fondly regarded here as across the Atlantic. They feel it's due to this market's reaction as Mercury's on-stage persona got more overt.  In short, the US market loved long-haired, proto-rock 'Bohemian Rhapsody' Freddie, but rejected the short-haired, mustachioed, tank top-wearing successor. Had this been 2014, things would probably be different. Lady Gaga has absolutely nothing on Freddie Mercury. In the early 80s, however, mainstream acceptance was an entirely different matter.It's that lack of familiarity with the latter stage Freddie that makes the 'The Great Pretender' such interesting viewing.  The short story known here is: he was the lead singer of Queen; he contracted AIDS; he died. That's far from the full story. First, the creative arc of the band extended far beyond the U.S. audience's span of interest. We missed out on many fine years. [In those days, if you were shut out of radio as new Queen works were at that point, you were effectively unseen and unheard.]Second, Mercury's creative juices and wide range of curiosity led him into many interesting side projects. Most notable: his interest in opera and resulting collaborations with Spanish star, Montserrat Caballe. Her heartfelt memories of their work together is among this documentary's high points.Also, there was a solo album, ""The Great Pretender."" The choice to cover that song says a  lot about what Mercury thought about his life. It's notable that director Rhys Thomas felt it an equally apropos title for this film.If Queen meant anything to you growing up like it did to me (we were a legion of millions here at one point), you owe it to yourself to see 'The Great Pretender.'",4,Reveals the pieces of Freddie Mercury's life that US audiences had mostly missed,1401148800,"05 27, 2014",2014,2283,"['documentary', 'sheds', 'light', 'life', 'Freddie', 'Mercury', 'late', 'great', 'lead', 'singer', 'composer', 'Queen', 'legend', 'Mercury', 'always', 'burned', 'brightly', 'UK', 'lesser', 'extent', 'continental', 'Europe', 'relative', 'enigma', 'US', 'fact', 'was', 'brought', 'home', 'recently', 'when', 'wife', 'went', 'see', 'Queen-themed', 'Rock', 'Ages', 'few', 'co-workers', 'whom', 'were', 'stunned', 'find', 'out', 'songs', 'obviously', 'adored', 'were', 'Queen', 'hits.The', 'surviving', 'members', 'band', 'have', 'been', 'quite', 'emphatic', 'reason', 'Mercury', 'band', ""n't"", 'as', 'fondly', 'regarded', 'here', 'Atlantic', 'feel', 'due', 'market', 'reaction', 'Mercury', 'on-stage', 'persona', 'got', 'more', 'overt', 'short', 'US', 'market', 'loved', 'long-haired', 'proto-rock', ""'Bohemian"", 'Rhapsody', 'Freddie', 'rejected', 'short-haired', 'mustachioed', 'tank', 'top-wearing', 'successor', 'Had', 'been', '2014', 'things', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'different', 'Lady', 'Gaga', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'Freddie', 'Mercury', 'early', '80s', 'however', 'mainstream', 'acceptance', 'was', 'entirely', 'different', 'matter.It', 'lack', 'familiarity', 'latter', 'stage', 'Freddie', ""'The"", 'Great', 'Pretender', 'such', 'interesting', 'viewing', 'short', 'story', 'known', 'here', 'was', 'lead', 'singer', 'Queen', 'contracted', 'AIDS', 'died', 'far', 'full', 'story', 'First', 'creative', 'arc', 'band', 'extended', 'far', 'U.S.', 'audience', 'span', 'interest', 'missed', 'out', 'many', 'fine', 'years', '[', 'days', 'were', 'shut', 'radio', 'new', 'Queen', 'works', 'were', 'point', 'were', 'effectively', 'unseen', 'unheard', ']', 'Second', 'Mercury', 'creative', 'juices', 'wide', 'range', 'curiosity', 'led', 'many', 'interesting', 'side', 'projects', 'Most', 'notable', 'interest', 'opera', 'resulting', 'collaborations', 'Spanish', 'star', 'Montserrat', 'Caballe', 'heartfelt', 'memories', 'work', 'together', 'documentary', 'high', 'points.Also', 'was', 'solo', 'album', 'Great', 'Pretender', 'choice', 'cover', 'song', 'lot', 'what', 'Mercury', 'thought', 'life', 'notable', 'director', 'Rhys', 'Thomas', 'felt', 'equally', 'apropos', 'title', 'film.If', 'Queen', 'meant', 'anything', 'growing', 'up', 'did', 'were', 'legion', 'millions', 'here', 'one', 'point', 'owe', 'yourself', 'see', ""'The"", 'Great', 'Pretender']",N/A

The 20+ years since he died of AIDS has seen numerous books, tell-alls, videos, etc.  Nevertheless, this is a good film for someone who is already big Freddie fan.  For someone not a big fan, it wouldn't be very appealing.The big Freddie fan would appreciate the interviews with those who knew him professionally and personally, and get a kick out of the little stories that reveal more about the man.  The film, while it does appreciate Freddie, doesn't paint him as a saint.  Most notable for me was the revelation from his producer/engineer Mack, who worked with Mercury on his solo album &#34;Mr. Bad Guy&#34;, that the Queen superstar approached the project with a bit less ambition than expected.  Mercury, it seems, wanted to have the success of Michael Jackson's &#34;Thriller&#34; without putting in the requisite work required.One comes away from this film realizing a bit more of Mercury's foibles--this isn't hagiography.

A generous, caring, thoughtful man with a self-deprecating sense of humor and a genuine passion for music. Freddie Mercury touched the lives of millions through his career both with Queen and as a solo performer.  The great folks at Eagle Rock Entertainment has released a new documentary about Freddie, The Great Pretender, and it is sure to delight and inform his legions of fans as never before.Created by the same team behind the widely acclaimed Queen: Days of Our Lives BBC documentary, The Great Pretender, in a similar vein, presents a compelling insight into its subject matter, unearthing previously undiscovered or rarely seen footage and is presented for the first time in High Definition.Produced and directed by Rhys Thomas, life-long Queen fan and expert (to the extent that Rhys famously broke the Mastermind all time record points score with a specialist subject of Queen), Rhys has this time turned his attention to the Freddie archive, going back as early as 1976 in search of vintage gems which reveal more than ever before the inside story of Freddie's life and career and the solo projects he worked on outside of Queen.The extensive archive footage is drawn from rare interviews with Freddie, concerts, video shoots and personal material, much of it being seen for the first time, along with newly filmed contributions from fellow Queen members Brian May and Roger Taylor, Queen manager Jim Beach, soprano Montserrat Caball&eacute;, composers David Arnold and Mike Moran, lyricist Tim Rice, comedian and lifelong fan Matt Lucas and many more.From it emerges a portrait of a man who was very different to his flamboyant onstage public persona. Sometimes raw in language and content but always insightful and informative, Queen fans will love this DVD.Among the treasures fans can look forward to viewing, The Great Pretender includes for the first time ever Freddie and Rod Stewart singing their demo for Take Another Piece of My Heart, an unreleased song from 1984, a snippet of the unreleased Michael Jackson / Freddie Mercury collaboration There Must Be More To Life Than This, and Freddie with the Royal Ballet 1979 - never seen in full before.Rhys, whose extensive scouting for lost material turned up a copy of the band's first TV appearance among the belongings of late comedian Dick Emery, brings to the light Freddie's earliest filmed interview from 1976 unearthed in Australia and another unseen interview from 1976 filmed by NBC in the USA.There's another unseen interview from 1985 filmed on set of I Was Born To Love You. Very funny, Freddie tells us how Queen was in a lift when they found out they were no.1 with Bohemian Rhapsody, jumped for joy and the lift stopped. `We thought we'd all suffocate in the damned lift.'""Rhys also found 10 cans of Freddie's 39th Black and White birthday party in Mrs. Henderson's nightclub in Munich in 1985. Originally filmed for the video for Living On My Own, and promptly banned by Freddie's record company because of its cross-dressing theme, there's much to be enjoyed in watching Freddie and his friends go full out in their efforts to help Freddie celebrate his last birthday before turning 40.On top of this, The Great Pretender has a feast of outtakes from the video shoots for I Want To Break Free, One Vision, Days of Our Lives, I Want It All, A Kind Of Magic, Princes of the Universe, Living on My Own, Born To Love You, Great Pretender, Made In Heaven, and Who Wants to Live Forever.Bonus features [that will not make up part of the version to be broadcast by the BBC] include Freddie Mercury Goes Solo and an extended interview with Montserrat Caball&eacute;.The Great Pretender is a required addition of Queen or Freddie Mercury fan's video library and is a great gift idea for the upcoming Christmas holidays.Boomerocity.com",5,Remembering the Great Freddie Mercury,1351036800,"10

1570898,A1KB2VS9JTCTHQ,B008N5UX74,Bug DeLug,"[71, 71]","Let me start by stating that I am biased. I believe Freddie Mercury to be the greatest showman of the late 20th century. People talk about him being a one off, but that really is understating it. Michael Jackson was a one off too, but his style has been copied ad infinitum, whereas anybody foolish enough to try to copy what Freddie could do onstage would surely be laughed at. With seemingly sparse footage of him away from the stage and the band though, I wondered if this would be just the usual boring retread of the same well-worn anecdotes. When I saw the likes of Paul Gambaccini and Peter 'Phoebe' Freestone I became even more concerned. I shouldn't have been. Hearing them gleefully talking about Freddie in his heyday was fantastic.So did the film live up to my expectations? No, in fact- it far succeeded them. I'd go as far as to say that this is actually superior to the Queen documentary, as a lot of this is unseen footage, and the story concentrates on certain aspects of Freddie's life that hasn't really been covered before. The Queen story is a fascinating one, but has been exhausted over the years, offering very little in the way of something new. This, on the other hand is full of fascinating material, and goes a long way towards humanising a great man. What it ultimately does though, is to make him seem more complicated, more complex and mysterious than ever before.With lots of footage of Freddie offstage, and off-guard the film basically covers the solo years of the mid to late eighties, beginning with him discovering and falling in love with dance music in the gay clubs of New York and Munich. Based around an interview that Freddie gave to David Wiggs in which he talks about his love life, his career and his views on the future of the band at that point.I could go on forever, but will wrap this up by saying that the pieces about his relationship with the risible Paul Prenter, his duets with Mosterrat Caballe and Michael Jackson, and his stint with the Royal Ballet are just some of the highlights here. The black and white footage of him on the set of the 'Days Of Our Lives' music video is what really seals it for me though. Close to the end of his life, but ever the showman- these few clips look wonderful and show a softer, more reflective side of his huge personality.  Sterling stuff indeed.The blu-ray looks and sounds fantastic. The HD footage of outtakes from the video for 'I Want To Break Free' was thrilling, and I'm looking forward to the blu-ray re-releases of all the old Queen videos that must be surely forthcoming. Now that Rhys Thomas (who has done a fantastic job piecing all of this together) has said that there will be no more documentaries I should imagine that a lot of that cut footage from those old video shoots will surface on some Greatest Flix package in the future. Here's hoping.So, with stories of llamas in studios, band in-fighting and lavish excess all-around I must say that this has been a thrilling addition to the Mercury canon, and though it seems that all areas have been exhausted I am hopeful that other aspects of his career (the mid-to-late 70's period for a start) will be covered in the future.

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[40, 40]","As I write this review, there are already two previous reviews, obviously by huge Freddie Mercury fans.  I may be the first one posting a review who only really knows Mercury as part of the band Queen, and who can't honestly say that I prefer Queen to many other rock bands. Still, I'm giving this DVD five stars as an informative and entertaining music documentary.I came to this DVD after watching - and reviewing here on Amazon - the music doc ""Queen - Days of Our Lives"" back in February 2012. It was produced and directed by the same team as this one and I found the earlier documentary well worth watching. This one is the same.Fellow reviewer Bug DeLug - obviously a passionate Mercury fan - has gone into a lot of detail about this DVD, so there is no reason to repeat much of the info. I will try to expand on it.The core program on this single DVD (I got the DVD, not the Bluray) is the 85-minute documentary. There are plenty of rare interviews with Mercury included and lots of archival footage. (The list of sources in the closing credits show how deep the producers dug.). There are contemporary interviews with critics, managers and two other members of Queen as well as Spanish soprano Montserrat Caballe, who duetted with Mercury on their album ""Barcelona"". There's another 2 minutes of bonuses too:Freddie Goes Solo is a 7-minute TV interview with Mercury from 1985 which was excerpted in the documentaryExtended interview with Caballe - also 7-minutesThe Making of ""Barcelona 2012"" - (5 minutes) in which the orchestrator who added a full symphonic score to the original album for release in 2012 and Caballe are interviewed.Even if you are not a Mercury or Queen die-hard you'll find this DVD worth watching if you follow the pop music industry at all.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",5,Great follow-up to the Queen music documentary released earlier this year.,1348790400,"09 28, 2012",2012,1863,"['write', 'review', 'are', 'already', 'two', 'previous', 'reviews', 'obviously', 'huge', 'Freddie', 'Mercury', 'fans', 'may', 'be', 'first', 'one', 'posting', 'review', 'who', 'only', 'really', 'Mercury', 'part', 'band', 'Queen', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'honestly', 'say', 'prefer', 'Queen', 'many', 'other', 'rock', 'bands', 'Still', ""'m"", 'giving', 'DVD', 'five', 'stars', 'informative', 'entertaining', 'music', 'documentary.I', 'came', 'DVD', 'watching', 'reviewing', 'here', 'Amazon', 'music', 'Queen', 'Days', 'Lives', 'back', 'February', '2012', 'was', 'produced', 'directed', 'same', 'team', 'one', 'found', 'earlier', 'documentary', 'well', 'watching', 'one', 'same.Fellow', 'reviewer', 'Bug', 'DeLug', 'obviously', 'passionate', 'Mercury', 'fan', 'gone', 'lot', 'detail', 'DVD', 'reason', 'repeat', 'much', 'info', 'will', 'try', 'expand', 'it.The', 'core', 'program', 'single', 'DVD', 'got', 'DVD', 'not', 'Bluray', '85-minute', 'documentary', 'are', 'plenty', 'rare', 'interviews', 'Mercury', 'included', 'lots', 'archival', 'footage', 'list', 'sources', 'closing', 'credits', 'show', 'how', 'deep', 'producers', 'dug.', 'are', 'contemporary', 'interviews', 'critics', 'managers', 'two', 'other', 'members', 'Queen', 'as', 'well', 'Spanish', 'soprano', 'Montserrat', 'Caballe', 'who', 'duetted', 'Mercury', 'album', 'Barcelona', '2', 'minutes', 'bonuses', 'too', 'Freddie', 'Goes', 'Solo', '7-minute', 'TV', 'interview', 'Mercury', '1985', 'was', 'excerpted', 'documentaryExtended', 'interview', 'Caballe', 'also', '7-minutesThe', 'Making', 'Barcelona', '2012', '5', 'minutes', 'orchestrator', 'who', 'added', 'full', 'symphonic', 'score', 'original', 'album', 'release', '2012', 'Caballe', 'are', 'interviewed.Even', 'are', 'not', 'Mercury', 'Queen', 'die-hard', ""'ll"", 'find', 'DVD', 'worth', 'watching', 'follow', 'pop', 'music', 'industry', 'all.I', 'hope', 'found', 'review', 'informative', 'helpful.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",N/A
