1113348,A3E8BTA2SXPV3P,B000X5KSXQ,cinemagirl,"[0, 0]","As a big Nelly Furtado fan, I really looked forward to this concert DVD. But I'd save my money -- Nelly can do better than this. Her albums, be it the more folksy ""Whoa! Nelly"" and ""Folkore"" or the more mainstream ""Loose"" -- are musical powerhouses, full of dynamism, passion, and verve. There's simply no one quite like Nelly, who has been influenced by artists around the world. She can sing Indian-tinged dance songs just as easily as she can belt out a soulful guitar piece reminiscent of Lilith Fair. It is therefore puzzling that her concert DVD falls so flat. Her ""Come As You Are"" and ""Folklore"" tours were thrilling, with Nelly running and jumping around the stage, connecting with her audience intimately, and setting the roof on fire. Her previous concerts had the air of someone who, on a caffeine high, just happened to stumble into a concert hall to join and lead the raucous crowd. On this DVD, she is stiff, calculated, and seemingly aware that this is her biggest tour yet -- so it better be commercially successful. Instead of her old school sneakers of yesteryear, she dons precarious high heels that prevent her from moving much. She waves her arms as she's glued to the mike stand. When she does move, it's with half of the energy she's usually known for, curious since this seems to be her biggest audience yet. Though it is understandable that she cannot reach into the crowd as she did with her smaller, more intimate concerts, this does not mean she can't forge a connection, which seems more vital for a show of this size, where there are fans who pay for nosebleed seats to see you perform for them. Her costumes are awkward and ill-fitting, more for the purpose of capitalizing on her new sexy image than for ease of maneuvering. It was difficult to watch the DVD to the end; it was, quite simply, boring, a descriptor I never thought I'd apply to Nelly Furtado. Though it is wonderful that she is experimenting, evolving, and embracing a new and mature image, it is at the expense of showmanship. It seemed that she thought she was performing for an audience made up of cardboard cut-outs. She flashed her beautiful smile, waved to the crowd, and thanked everyone for supporting her, but even these motions seemed rehearsed and choreographed. The live variations of her songs, previously so exciting in that she often brilliantly improvised them, are now awkward and vapid reworkings, akin to the throwaway remixes by obscure DJs you had to endure back in the day when people still bought physical CD singles. ""Loose,"" a great pop album, falls flat in its translation to concert form. Previous album songs are mostly similarly mangled and made irrelevant, with the exception of the gorgeous ""Try."" I hope Nelly can find a way to recapture the magic of her old performances while continuing to grow as an artist. It seems that she threw out the baby with the bathwater.",2,A disappointing and dull concert from the talented Nelly Furtado.,1250035200,"08 12, 2009",2009,2897,"['big', 'Nelly', 'Furtado', 'fan', 'really', 'looked', 'forward', 'concert', 'DVD', ""'d"", 'save', 'money', 'Nelly', 'can', 'do', 'better', 'albums', 'be', 'more', 'folksy', 'Whoa', 'Nelly', 'Folkore', 'more', 'mainstream', 'Loose', 'are', 'musical', 'powerhouses', 'full', 'dynamism', 'passion', 'verve', 'simply', 'one', 'quite', 'Nelly', 'who', 'been', 'influenced', 'artists', 'world', 'can', 'sing', 'Indian-tinged', 'dance', 'songs', 'just', 'as', 'easily', 'can', 'belt', 'out', 'soulful', 'guitar', 'piece', 'reminiscent', 'Lilith', 'Fair', 'therefore', 'puzzling', 'concert', 'DVD', 'so', 'flat', 'Come', 'Are', 'Folklore', 'tours', 'were', 'thrilling', 'Nelly', 'running', 'jumping', 'stage', 'connecting', 'audience', 'intimately', 'setting', 'roof', 'fire', 'previous', 'concerts', 'had', 'air', 'someone', 'who', 'caffeine', 'high', 'just', 'happened', 'stumble', 'concert', 'hall', 'join', 'lead', 'raucous', 'crowd', 'DVD', 'stiff', 'calculated', 'seemingly', 'aware', 'biggest', 'tour', 'yet', 'better', 'be', 'commercially', 'successful', 'Instead', 'old', 'school', 'sneakers', 'yesteryear', 'precarious', 'high', 'heels', 'prevent', 'moving', 'much', 'arms', 'glued', 'mike', 'stand', 'When', 'move', 'half', 'energy', 'usually', 'known', 'curious', 'be', 'biggest', 'audience', 'yet', 'understandable', 'can', 'not', 'reach', 'crowd', 'did', 'smaller', 'more', 'intimate', 'concerts', 'not', 'mean', 'ca', ""n't"", 'forge', 'connection', 'more', 'vital', 'show', 'size', 'where', 'are', 'fans', 'who', 'pay', 'nosebleed', 'seats', 'see', 'perform', 'costumes', 'are', 'awkward', 'ill-fitting', 'more', 'purpose', 'capitalizing', 'new', 'sexy', 'image', 'ease', 'maneuvering', 'was', 'difficult', 'watch', 'DVD', 'end', 'was', 'quite', 'simply', 'boring', 'descriptor', 'never', 'thought', ""'d"", 'apply', 'Nelly', 'Furtado', 'wonderful', 'experimenting', 'evolving', 'embracing', 'new', 'mature', 'image', 'expense', 'showmanship', 'seemed', 'thought', 'was', 'performing', 'audience', 'made', 'cardboard', 'cut-outs', 'flashed', 'beautiful', 'smile', 'waved', 'crowd', 'thanked', 'everyone', 'supporting', 'even', 'motions', 'seemed', 'rehearsed', 'choreographed', 'live', 'variations', 'songs', 'previously', 'so', 'exciting', 'often', 'brilliantly', 'improvised', 'are', 'now', 'awkward', 'vapid', 'reworkings', 'akin', 'throwaway', 'remixes', 'obscure', 'DJs', 'had', 'endure', 'back', 'day', 'when', 'people', 'still', 'bought', 'physical', 'CD', 'singles', 'Loose', 'great', 'pop', 'album', 'flat', 'translation', 'concert', 'form', 'Previous', 'album', 'songs', 'are', 'mostly', 'similarly', 'mangled', 'made', 'irrelevant', 'exception', 'gorgeous', 'Try', 'hope', 'Nelly', 'can', 'find', 'way', 'recapture', 'magic', 'old', 'performances', 'continuing', 'grow', 'artist', 'threw', 'out', 'baby', 'bathwater']",N/A

This concert came out recently, showcasing a number of hits from her Loose album and some older ones. I brought this concert because of the simple fact that I love the Loose album and wanted to see it come to life in front of my eyes. I was disappointed!!!! Nelly's performance was so boring, I almost had to force myself to keep watching. With songs like ""Wait for You"", ""Afraid"", ""Say It Right"", and ""Give it to Me"" being performed, I expected nothing short of an amazing concert. She absolutly murderered her own songs making me hate the live version of them. At times, even the crowd was silent and appeared stunned at what they were looking at. Stick to the CD and do not purchase this DVD, you'll regret it! I've brought some pretty crappy things in my life, but this is by far one of the top of that list.",2,Could Have Been Way Better!,1198972800,"12 30, 2007",2007,900,"['Nelly', 'Furtado', 'had', 'one', 'greatest', 'years', 'career', 'early', '2006', 'late', '2007', 'concert', 'came', 'out', 'recently', 'showcasing', 'number', 'hits', 'Loose', 'album', 'older', 'ones', 'brought', 'concert', 'simple', 'fact', 'love', 'Loose', 'album', 'wanted', 'see', 'come', 'life', 'front', 'eyes', 'was', 'disappointed', 'Nelly', 'performance', 'was', 'so', 'boring', 'almost', 'had', 'force', 'keep', 'watching', 'songs', 'Wait', 'Afraid', 'Say', 'Right', 'Give', 'Me', 'being', 'performed', 'expected', 'nothing', 'short', 'amazing', 'concert', 'absolutly', 'murderered', 'own', 'songs', 'making', 'hate', 'live', 'version', 'times', 'even', 'crowd', 'was', 'silent', 'appeared', 'stunned', 'what', 'were', 'looking', 'Stick', 'CD', 'do', 'not', 'purchase', 'DVD', ""'ll"", 'regret', ""'ve"", 'brought', 'pretty', 'crappy', 'things', 'life', 'far', 'one', 'top', 'list']",N/A

I love her music, love her voice, she is a talented writer, and she has unique beauty (her face looks like it was perfectly chiseled). Her videos from ""Loose"" were great ""Say it Right"" was my song of 2007, ""Permiscuous Girl"" an amazing track, ""All good things (come to an end)"" lovely track and video and ""God's hand"" another beautiful ballad that is only Nelly Furtado.So I have it clear that I love her, but I did not enjoy this concert at all, okay they where moments, when she sang the ballads I paid attention. But the production level seemed mediocre, I mean 'Loose' was the biggest female solo album that year, an incredible success. The concert does not show this, and to make matter worse I by mistake bought two copies of this DVD. Its just not a concert I want to watch over and over again.
