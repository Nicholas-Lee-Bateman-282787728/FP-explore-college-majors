How is this collection NOT already in your library!Tango & Cash - your textbook, almost superhero, prime of life, Anglo males taking on corrupt baddies who, apparently, can only function if these TWO cops are taken off the scene. And by taken off the scene I mean (spoiler alert) sent to jail and then snuffed out. Jack Palance plays a villain which is his bread and butter. I can't even imagine him not being a bad guy on film. Perfect film from that era.The Specialist - Incredibly generic film, but minus the fun, or the (over) acting that makes Tango pop. Not bad, but not that great either.Over The Top - Single father, looking to stay connected with his son. Robert Loggia as the jerk father in law. And, EVERYONE'S first glimpse into the very much a real thing world of professional arm wrestling. An utterly perfect film.Demolition Man - I understand why this movie didn't blow people away. Looking back on it, though, it should've. Snipes absolutely slays as the film's antagonist. Doesn't have a wasted line in the entire film, and is scarily accurate in his execution. Stallone is Stallone, no more no less. Bullock plays a loveable......plays a likeable character as a new age police officer with a thirst for (old school) action.BUY THIS.

1093296,A2BQBLCKJHP65G,B000U1ZV62,"Eric Ericson ""RedSabbath""","[21, 21]","Okay let's be brief:If you want to kick-start a Stallone collection, this set is a good way to do it. You get one simple keepcase with a leaf inside that holds two double-sided discs. Each movie is exactly as they were released back in the late 90's/early 2000's on DVD, there's nothing new here. But this time they pressed each's anamorphic widescreen side ignoring the fullframe that was originally offered separately. All the movies in this set are single-layer, so don't expect a high bit rate, even though each film looks pretty darn good for standard DVD definition. It's well worth the $10 I paid for it.Personally, I bought it to finally have a copy of Demolition Man, probably the best film here. But the others, especially if you're a Stallone fan to begin with, aren't too bad either. Warner Bros did a good job thinking up a new 4 Film Favorites line, and here's to hoping they do a ""Stallone Collection II"" in the future!NOTE:I've heard that ""Tango & Cash"" isn't anamorphic like the box stated, but the others are (remember what I said, each of these are EXACTLY as they were originally released, and T&C; was first released non-anamorphic).

1093302,AUQUTT47CU3P7,B000U1ZV62,L. Young,"[7, 9]","My two absolute favorites in this set are on the flip-side of each other: Demolition Man and Tango & Cash. They're action-packed and have touches of humor.One being Kurt Russell dressed as a woman and wearing spike heels in Tango & Cash. The combination of Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell was right on the money. They play well off of each other. Their characters are direct opposites but both are good and effective cops. In fact, too effective because they're both set up by the same criminal whose business they keep busting up. They both get jail sentences and are supposed to go to a minimum security facility but the crime boss works it so they go to a grungy maximum security prison where he owns the guards and where there are a lot of guys that Tango and Cash have put away. They escape and do their own investigating and clear their names while getting ""the gov'nor"" who set them up.Stallone as the good ""mad man"" going after the bad ""mad man"" Wesley Snipes in Demolition Man was a good hate-hate relationship and led to many great action fights and pursuits. It takes place in the future where society is devoid of violence and people have ""joy-joy"" feelings above ground where anything deemed not good for you is outlawed - like salt on food. But, the people who choose to live with all the unhealthy things are living underground and have to forage for their food. Jesse Ventura has a small part as one of Snipes' thawed-out criminals.The Specialist has a lot of explosive action with a bit of romance between the assassin Stallone and the calculating, vengeful Sharon Stone. The two share a very hot shower scene.Over The Top is not as action-packed but it's a good story about a disconnected father and son who are put together after the wealthy mother dies and it's her last wish that the trucker/arm wrestler father get to know his son, so they go on the road together. It took some time for them to get along because the son was a spoiled rich kid whose grandfather did not like his father and greatly objected to the father (Stallone) having anything to do with his own son. The son's knowledge of his father was greatly influenced by his grandfather's viewpoint. But, in the end, the father/son become a duo as the grandfather pushes a little too hard against Stallone, in addition to under-estimating the bond that occurred by the two being together.",4,Four Times The Action,1223510400,"10 9, 2008",2008,2375,"['two', 'absolute', 'favorites', 'set', 'are', 'flip-side', 'other', 'Demolition', 'Man', 'Tango', 'Cash', ""'re"", 'action-packed', 'have', 'touches', 'humor.One', 'being', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'dressed', 'woman', 'wearing', 'spike', 'heels', 'Tango', 'Cash', 'combination', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'was', 'right', 'money', 'play', 'well', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'direct', 'opposites', 'are', 'good', 'effective', 'cops', 'fact', 'too', 'effective', ""'re"", 'set', 'up', 'same', 'criminal', 'business', 'keep', 'busting', 'up', 'get', 'jail', 'sentences', 'are', 'supposed', 'go', 'minimum', 'security', 'facility', 'crime', 'boss', 'go', 'grungy', 'maximum', 'security', 'prison', 'where', 'guards', 'where', 'are', 'lot', 'guys', 'Tango', 'Cash', 'have', 'put', 'away', 'escape', 'do', 'own', 'investigating', 'clear', 'names', 'getting', ""gov'nor"", 'who', 'set', 'up.Stallone', 'good', 'mad', 'man', 'going', 'bad', 'mad', 'man', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'Demolition', 'Man', 'was', 'good', 'hate-hate', 'relationship', 'led', 'many', 'great', 'action', 'fights', 'pursuits', 'place', 'future', 'where', 'society', 'devoid', 'violence', 'people', 'have', 'joy-joy', 'feelings', 'ground', 'where', 'anything', 'deemed', 'not', 'good', 'outlawed', 'salt', 'food', 'people', 'who', 'choose', 'live', 'unhealthy', 'things', 'are', 'living', 'underground', 'have', 'forage', 'food', 'Jesse', 'Ventura', 'small', 'part', 'one', 'Snipes', 'thawed-out', 'criminals.The', 'Specialist', 'lot', 'explosive', 'action', 'bit', 'romance', 'assassin', 'Stallone', 'calculating', 'vengeful', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'two', 'share', 'very', 'hot', 'shower', 'scene.Over', 'Top', 'not', 'action-packed', 'good', 'story', 'disconnected', 'father', 'son', 'who', 'are', 'put', 'together', 'wealthy', 'mother', 'dies', 'last', 'wish', 'trucker/arm', 'wrestler', 'father', 'get', 'know', 'son', 'go', 'road', 'together', 'took', 'time', 'get', 'along', 'son', 'was', 'spoiled', 'rich', 'kid', 'grandfather', 'did', 'not', 'father', 'greatly', 'objected', 'father', 'Stallone', 'having', 'anything', 'do', 'own', 'son', 'son', 'knowledge', 'father', 'was', 'greatly', 'influenced', 'grandfather', 'viewpoint', 'end', 'father/son', 'become', 'duo', 'grandfather', 'little', 'too', 'hard', 'Stallone', 'addition', 'under-estimating', 'bond', 'occurred', 'two', 'being', 'together']","4 Film Favorites: Sylvester Stallone (Demolition Man, Over The Top, The Specialist, Tango & Cash)"
