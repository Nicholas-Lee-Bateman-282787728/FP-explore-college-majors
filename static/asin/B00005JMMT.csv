It was the best written drama and an ORIGINAL take on the ""police show"" formula, God knows we need one more Law and Order franchise.

It was complex enough to hold your interest, but it never got confusing.The actors they got for the roles were perfectly cast. From Neal McDonough and his excellent vocal prowes to Donnie Wahlberg's compassionate but Joel Stevens and his tandem Mykelti Williamson with the perfect nickname ""Fearless"" every actor brought their own edge to the roles.Thank you for putting the show on DVD for myself and others to enjoy and hopefully show other people why it was such a travesty that this show was cut!",5,Why the hell did they cancel this series?,1089763200,"07 14, 2004",2004,859,"[""'m"", 'still', 'saddened', 'fact', 'series', 'air', 'was', 'best', 'written', 'drama', 'ORIGINAL', 'take', 'police', 'show', 'formula', 'God', 'need', 'one', 'more', 'Law', 'Order', 'franchise', 'showing', 'different', 'angles', 'different', 'points', 'view', 'get', 'further', 'story', 'further', 'truth', 'guess', 'why', 'was', 'cancelled', 'was', 'complex', 'enough', 'hold', 'interest', 'never', 'got', 'confusing.The', 'actors', 'got', 'roles', 'were', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Neal', 'McDonough', 'excellent', 'vocal', 'prowes', 'Donnie', 'Wahlberg', 'compassionate', 'Joel', 'Stevens', 'tandem', 'Mykelti', 'Williamson', 'perfect', 'nickname', 'Fearless', 'actor', 'brought', 'own', 'edge', 'roles.Thank', 'putting', 'show', 'DVD', 'others', 'enjoy', 'hopefully', 'show', 'other', 'people', 'why', 'was', 'such', 'travesty', 'show', 'was', 'cut']",Boomtown - Season One

620449,AORW1FRF4D4KS,B00005JMMT,azindn,"[9, 9]","One of the most innovative, best directed, and conceived dramatic series which lasted only a brief two seasons, ""Boomtown"" is now defunct and it is our loss. Each weekly episode featured the seven different perspectives of the principle characters, beat cops Tom and Ray, detectives Fearless Smith and Joel Stevens, self-loathing alcoholic deputy D.A. McNorris, his rich-girl mistress and investigative reporter Andrea, and heart of gold EMT, Teresa. Using the L.A. streets and iconic landscapes to situate the weekly stories of crime and punishment, the cast gives mini-one act plays that feature the storyline from their unique pov. It is a subtle method of storytelling and obviously one that was much too subtle for NBC which dropped the production after it won several awards. However, the series is preserved on DVD which makes this exceptional work available. With Neal McDonaugh, Donny Wahlberg, and Jason Gedrick, directed by Graham Yost, the individual performances marked the epitome of ensemble casts. The only drawback to the series is the tinkering which NBC initiated in the second season that changed the format of the individual perspectives to feature a single actor, however that did not lessen the superior scripts and exceptional cinematography as well as performances that were showcased each week.The DVD features some commentary by producers and cast, although the two brief exposition shorts at the end of disc 5 is far from  comprehensive.  Good for bits on each of the actors however, which lends to the appreciation of the overall series performances and directorial challenge.

620450,AR37967IAR6ZT,B00005JMMT,Benjamin,"[31, 31]","""Boomtown,"" cancelled early in its second season by NBC, featured an intriguing, complicated premise and had the ambition to stage a different, twisted mystery to its audience every single week. Watching the first season DVDs, the scope of how ambitious and great ""Boomtown"" was - and perhaps why it didn't catch on quickly with viewers - becomes abundantly clear.""Boomtown"" promised the story of a crime told from EVERY point of view. The uniformed officers on the scene, the detectives investigating the crime, the assistant DA handling it, the reporter covering it and the paramedic working it all were main characters. The episodes themselves were divided into segments, showcasing a different perspective. Because of this, occasionally the audience would find out larger details or hidden, personal motives that the characters wouldn't themselves discover. Also, because of this ""Rashomon""-inspired twist, a different member of the cast could end up at the center of every episode.The cast, led by Donnie Wahlberg, Mykelti Williamson and the great Neal McDonough, was incredibly talented - particularly the supporting actor Gary Basaraba, who really ought to work more.Though the episodes focused on a crime, the gimmick of ""Boomtown"" allowed the audience to glance into the twisted, complicated lives of its main characters, as well. So, in addition to showing an episode about a weird hit-and-run accident, the audience would get to see ADA David McNorris' alcoholic descent. While dealing with an episode on a drive-by shooting, the audience gets to experience wrenching moments from the character Fearless' scarred childhood. And while the other characters think Det. Joel Stevens leads a charmed life, the audience gets to see just how bad things are getting for him at home.The premise worked more often than it didn't, and some episodes of ""Boomtown"" are better than others. My personal favorites were ""Coyote,"" which featured an odd crime scene; ""Reeling through the Years,"" featuring an investigation into a 1976 shooting; ""The David McNorris Show,"" featuring the ADA's spin-doctor work on a crime; and ""Fearless,"" the drive-by shooting episode that left me in tears by its end.I'm not usually a fan of cop shows, but ""Boomtown"" is far from the usual cop show.",5,"Crimes, as seen from every point of view.",1094256000,"09 4, 2004",2004,2274,"['Boomtown', 'cancelled', 'early', 'second', 'season', 'NBC', 'featured', 'intriguing', 'complicated', 'premise', 'had', 'ambition', 'stage', 'different', 'twisted', 'mystery', 'audience', 'single', 'week', 'Watching', 'first', 'season', 'DVDs', 'scope', 'how', 'ambitious', 'great', 'Boomtown', 'was', 'perhaps', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'catch', 'quickly', 'viewers', 'abundantly', 'clear', 'Boomtown', 'promised', 'story', 'crime', 'told', 'EVERY', 'point', 'view', 'uniformed', 'officers', 'scene', 'detectives', 'investigating', 'crime', 'assistant', 'DA', 'handling', 'reporter', 'covering', 'paramedic', 'working', 'were', 'main', 'characters', 'episodes', 'were', 'divided', 'segments', 'showcasing', 'different', 'perspective', 'occasionally', 'audience', 'would', 'find', 'out', 'larger', 'details', 'hidden', 'personal', 'motives', 'characters', 'would', ""n't"", 'discover', 'Also', 'Rashomon', '-inspired', 'twist', 'different', 'member', 'cast', 'could', 'end', 'up', 'center', 'episode.The', 'cast', 'led', 'Donnie', 'Wahlberg', 'Mykelti', 'Williamson', 'great', 'Neal', 'McDonough', 'was', 'incredibly', 'talented', 'particularly', 'supporting', 'actor', 'Gary', 'Basaraba', 'who', 'really', 'ought', 'work', 'episodes', 'focused', 'crime', 'gimmick', 'Boomtown', 'allowed', 'audience', 'glance', 'twisted', 'complicated', 'lives', 'main', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'So', 'addition', 'showing', 'episode', 'weird', 'hit-and-run', 'accident', 'audience', 'would', 'get', 'see', 'ADA', 'David', 'McNorris', 'alcoholic', 'descent', 'dealing', 'episode', 'drive-by', 'shooting', 'audience', 'experience', 'wrenching', 'moments', 'character', 'Fearless', 'scarred', 'childhood', 'other', 'characters', 'think', 'Det', 'Joel', 'Stevens', 'charmed', 'life', 'audience', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'bad', 'things', 'are', 'getting', 'home.The', 'premise', 'worked', 'more', 'often', 'did', ""n't"", 'episodes', 'Boomtown', 'are', 'better', 'others', 'personal', 'favorites', 'were', 'Coyote', 'featured', 'odd', 'crime', 'scene', 'Reeling', 'Years', 'featuring', 'investigation', '1976', 'shooting', 'David', 'McNorris', 'Show', 'featuring', 'ADA', 'spin-doctor', 'work', 'crime', 'Fearless', 'drive-by', 'shooting', 'episode', 'left', 'tears', 'end.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'usually', 'fan', 'cop', 'shows', 'Boomtown', 'far', 'usual', 'cop', 'show']",Boomtown - Season One

Mykelti Williamson's ""Fearless"" is quirky and complex (he is probably best known for his role as Bubba in Forrest Gump).  Neal McDonough is superb as the uptight, upright, yet slightly out-of-control ADA David McNorris.  Jason Gedrick, Lana Parrilla, Nina Garbiras, Donnie Wahlberg, and Gary Basaraba round out an ensemble cast, painting rich portraits of people with stressful jobs and personal lives.The photography and ""graphic look"" of the show are innovative, and the ""multiple perspective"" aspect of the plot exposition is clever and eye-opening.  There are surprising plot twists at every turn.There are some interesting guest appearances, as well.  Patricia Wettig from Thirty-Something does a great job as a Patty Hearst-like former terrorist.It is a sad commentary on our American culture that shows like this do not succeed while tons of pathetic, identical sewage pour from the screen daily.If you have a multi-standard DVD player, go to amazon.co.uk and order this today.

Suffice it to say that the day they canceled this show after only two airings in the TV-graveyard of Friday nights, I promised to never watch any new NBC drama again. This was one of the most well written dramas i have ever seen, with characters that really carried the series. It wasn't just a situation drama, the protagonists were flawed and human yet still larger than life. I am happy to see that it's coming out on DVD and I'm more than willing to pay up for it (and I don't usually buy TV shows on DVD). Hopefully DVD can do for ""Boomtown"" what it has done for ""Family Guy""; resurrect it back for a new season in the future.If you want to see good quality TV, watch this show.

I was willing to give it a chance and see where it would go from there, they never got a chance to focus an episode on her and it's only because NBC put her on at the same time that they forced the writers to be more ""procedural"" that we may think she brought the show down.Me, i'm just smiling at NBC's predicament now, what with Lost and Desparate Housewives bringing intelligent and gripping TV back to us and them wallowing in last place with not one critical or ratings hit in site. Ah, Karma is a female dog...As of April 4 2006, the only new NBC show I have watched is My Name Is Earl, and NBC still refuses to do the intelligent thing by teaming it up with Scrubs. I follow the West Wing out of respect in the downtime between the Simpsons and The Sopranos, but never again will I view an NBC drama series.",5,NBC dropped the ball BIG TIME,1084147200,"05 10, 2004",2004,1865,"[""'d"", 'say', 'lot', 'more', 'NBC', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'sued', 'slander', 'Suffice', 'say', 'day', 'canceled', 'show', 'only', 'two', 'airings', 'TV-graveyard', 'Friday', 'nights', 'promised', 'never', 'watch', 'new', 'NBC', 'drama', 'again', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'well', 'written', 'dramas', 'i', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'characters', 'really', 'carried', 'series', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'situation', 'drama', 'protagonists', 'were', 'flawed', 'human', 'yet', 'still', 'larger', 'life', 'am', 'happy', 'see', 'coming', 'out', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'more', 'willing', 'pay', 'up', 'do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'buy', 'TV', 'shows', 'DVD', 'Hopefully', 'DVD', 'can', 'do', 'Boomtown', 'what', 'done', 'Family', 'Guy', 'resurrect', 'back', 'new', 'season', 'future.If', 'want', 'see', 'good', 'quality', 'TV', 'watch', 'show', 'one', 'will', 'ever', 'remember', 'Lyon', 'Den', 'killed', 'Kingpin', 'NBC', 'tried', 'replace', 'show', 'NBC', 'shoddy', 'treatment', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'as', 'long', 'television', 'exists.Amended', 'Nov', '3', '2004I', 'just', 'wanted', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Vanessa', 'Williams', 'ruined', 'show', 'was', 'willing', 'give', 'chance', 'see', 'where', 'would', 'go', 'there', 'never', 'got', 'chance', 'focus', 'episode', 'only', 'NBC', 'put', 'same', 'time', 'forced', 'writers', 'be', 'more', 'procedural', 'may', 'think', 'brought', 'show', 'down.Me', 'i', ""'m"", 'just', 'smiling', 'NBC', 'predicament', 'now', 'what', 'Lost', 'Desparate', 'Housewives', 'bringing', 'intelligent', 'gripping', 'TV', 'back', 'wallowing', 'last', 'place', 'not', 'one', 'critical', 'ratings', 'hit', 'site', 'Ah', 'Karma', 'female', 'dog', 'April', '4', '2006', 'only', 'new', 'NBC', 'show', 'have', 'watched', 'Name', 'Earl', 'NBC', 'still', 'do', 'intelligent', 'thing', 'teaming', 'up', 'Scrubs', 'follow', 'West', 'Wing', 'respect', 'downtime', 'Simpsons', 'Sopranos', 'never', 'again', 'will', 'view', 'NBC', 'drama', 'series']",Boomtown - Season One

Boomtown is one such show. Working at an NBC affiliate, this show was one of less than a handfull of shows that I actually looked forward to putting on the air. I never expected to see it released and for a bargain price of around $17 you can't go wrong.I guarantee you've never seen a show like it. The ""seen from every side"" storytelling approach was a fresh and very effective concept. This show is certainly not your normal cop show. The characters were human- with flaws and weaknesses - not superhuman bullet spraying heros like a lot of shows. Though the episode where Fearless has the gunfight at the motel is a little too exaggerated, the rest of the show is pretty darn good and some of it is truly excellent.

Williams - d'oh, and ""simpler"" storylines.  The first season of this show -- the only REAL season for fans of the show -- is a tour de force.Donnie Wahlberg finally put that boys' band completely behind him, as you watched his Detective Joel Steven put back together his life and career.  Neal McDonough here is playing one of the most richly-drawn a**holes in the history of the electronic media.  And Mykelti Williamson's Fearless is why Noir is not dead.

I was gratified that NBC and the producers of Boomtown realized that the audience for the show was large enough to warrant a DVD box set release; as a bonus, the price is very reasonable.In general, I still love watching the show and most of the episodes stand up to repeated watching.  I also have two quibbles with this set:1.  The most glaring deficit is not including the six episodes of the very truncated season 2 in the set.  Although the cast and format changed slightly, the season 2 episodes are just as good , if not better in some respects, than season 1.  Season 2's inclusion would have greatly increased the appeal of this set and I believe the production costs would not have increased significantly.2.  I greatly enjoyed most of the episode commentary included in this set.  I would have appreciated much more commentary, perhaps even for every episode, as well as quality deleted scenes.

There's been a recent change in my philosphy.  The first TV package I bought was the first season of THE SOPRANOS.  The second was the first two seasons of HOMICIDE: LIFE ON THE STREET.  I bought both of those used.  The third one I bought (and the first I was willing to pay the new price for) was Season One of BOOMTOWN.I first caught BOOMTOWN while it was still airing on NBC and I instantly fell in love with it.  It was smartly written, had a stellar cast and used arguably the most innovative storytelling design ever thought up.  When I heard that the plug had been pulled, I literally felt like going to NBC headquarters and demanding that answers be given to my face.For whatever reason, it was evident that NBC did not want this show.  I don't know if one of the actors made a remark about the mother of one of the network executives or if just wasn't pulling in the demographic that NBC wanted, but the writing on the wall came with season two's delayed start.  The horrible truth became apparent once BOOMTOWN was moved from Sundays to Fridays (if you want a drama to lose any possible chance of viewership, just move it to Friday nights).  For their part, the producers tried.  They brought in Vanessa Williams in hopes that her name would save the sinking ship, but I'm sure the suits at NBC had already made up their minds.

The current realities of network television don't seem to allow for such such partisanship. Schematic cop shows (i.e., the ""Law & Order"" and ""CSI"" franchises) are easy to sell; something different, deeper -- better -- not so easy. Viewers prefer the realtive comfort of shows which, hoewever disturbing their content, resolve themselves neatly within the 60-minute time frame. And so NBC knocked off not only its best show since ""Homicide"" (which I argue was the finest drama in the history of the medium) but anyone's best show. The creative team behind ""Boomtown"" were determined to exploit the medium in refreshing ways. I hate that phrase ""It was too good to last"" but in this case, it seems to have been true.

620475,A30X7VQZILMFZT,B00005JMMT,Sertorius,"[5, 5]","I had heard a great deal about Boomtown while it was on the air, but I have to admit that I never got around to watching it.  Finding it on DVD was a bit bitter-sweet, because in this case the buzz and reviews were absolutely correct - this was one of the best shows of the past decade brought to premature demise by a short-sighted network.  NBC's decline this season seems just punishment.  Boomtown was everything that its network was not - bold, experimental, emotionally evocative and very smart.  It wasn't perfect; if you look carefully there are continuity mistakes to be found and some suspension of disbelief required to buy some of the scenarios, but it was always powerful and compelling drama.  One of the reasons that Boomtown's non-linear, somewhat schizophrenic format worked so well is that it actually brought the viewer deeply into each characters perspective.  Rather than dealing with a generic police procedural we got careful character development and arcs that extended through the entire season.  Each episode usually involved one main case seen from multiple points of view (made clear by chapter titles with the character's name) from main characters as well as criminals and victims.  Frequently these points of view intersect, showing the same scene through different eyes, displaying different elements (using filtered colors for the intersections).  By looking through their eyes we came to know these characters and by seeing them unfold and develop over tbe course of the season we came to care about them.  My persona favorites were the conflicted DDA David McNorris and the surprizingly wise Detective Bobby ""Fearless"" Smith.  David's decline throughout the season was particularly compelling, as self-loathing and alcoholism, caused this enourmously capable and idealistic man to spin out of control.  Fearless had most of the best action in the series (in more ways than one), but never let it be gratuitous or stupid.  So in short I can strongly recommend Boomtown to anyone who loves quality television.  My only regret is that if it lasted it might have climbed to even greater heights.",5,A Bitter-Sweet Discovery,1104364800,"12 30, 2004",2004,2126,"['had', 'heard', 'great', 'deal', 'Boomtown', 'was', 'air', 'have', 'admit', 'never', 'got', 'watching', 'Finding', 'DVD', 'was', 'bit', 'bitter-sweet', 'case', 'buzz', 'reviews', 'were', 'absolutely', 'correct', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'past', 'decade', 'brought', 'premature', 'demise', 'short-sighted', 'network', 'NBC', 'decline', 'season', 'just', 'punishment', 'Boomtown', 'was', 'everything', 'network', 'was', 'not', 'bold', 'experimental', 'emotionally', 'evocative', 'very', 'smart', 'was', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'look', 'carefully', 'are', 'continuity', 'mistakes', 'be', 'found', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'required', 'buy', 'scenarios', 'was', 'always', 'powerful', 'compelling', 'drama', 'One', 'reasons', 'Boomtown', 'non-linear', 'somewhat', 'schizophrenic', 'format', 'worked', 'so', 'well', 'actually', 'brought', 'viewer', 'deeply', 'characters', 'perspective', 'Rather', 'dealing', 'generic', 'police', 'procedural', 'got', 'careful', 'character', 'development', 'arcs', 'extended', 'entire', 'season', 'episode', 'usually', 'involved', 'one', 'main', 'case', 'seen', 'multiple', 'points', 'view', 'made', 'clear', 'chapter', 'titles', 'character', 'name', 'main', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'criminals', 'victims', 'Frequently', 'points', 'view', 'intersect', 'showing', 'same', 'scene', 'different', 'eyes', 'displaying', 'different', 'elements', 'using', 'filtered', 'colors', 'intersections', 'looking', 'eyes', 'came', 'know', 'characters', 'seeing', 'unfold', 'develop', 'tbe', 'course', 'season', 'came', 'care', 'persona', 'favorites', 'were', 'conflicted', 'DDA', 'David', 'McNorris', 'surprizingly', 'wise', 'Detective', 'Bobby', 'Fearless', 'Smith', 'David', 'decline', 'season', 'was', 'particularly', 'compelling', 'self-loathing', 'alcoholism', 'caused', 'enourmously', 'capable', 'idealistic', 'man', 'spin', 'control', 'Fearless', 'had', 'most', 'best', 'action', 'series', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'never', 'let', 'be', 'gratuitous', 'stupid', 'So', 'short', 'can', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'Boomtown', 'anyone', 'who', 'quality', 'television', 'only', 'regret', 'lasted', 'might', 'have', 'climbed', 'even', 'greater', 'heights']",Boomtown - Season One

I was fairly certain it was a good show, but I was hesitant because I remembered some of NBC's marketing when it briefly aired.  They made it sound like a murder mystery show. It's not.Boomtown shows the viewer not just multiple angles of a crime, but also multiple stories through the eyes of various characters that enhance the overall story.  A traditional show, especially a crime drama, will show you different parts of the story in chronological order.  There might be flashbacks, but they're generally exactly at the right time in order to fill in a necessary plot point.Boomtown wasn't created that way.  The angle shifts according to character.  They don't flash the text ""4 hours later"" on the screen like more traditional shows like Without A Trace.  Instead, they'll have a character's name like ""Joel"" and then they'll show you his story and point of view.  Sometimes you see what he saw at the crime scene, other times you'll see something in his personal life that relates to why he's reacting a certain way to the crime. I can't think of a single show on the air or in recent memory that has ever taken this approach.  It does require paying more attention a little more brain power, but that's what makes it great TV.Boomtown is a well blended mosaic that just seems to fit perfectly.  Because the scenes aren't chronological it allows the show more leeway to present multiple sub-stories and just better character development.  It's likely the producers of Lost watched an episode or two of Boomtown before they came up with their idea.  Boomtown's stories aren't as complex as Lost's, but it's still groundbreaking in its presentation.  Too bad it rests in obscurity while other horrible programs remain on the air.Boomtown stars Neal McDonough and Donnie Wahlberg and was created by Grahm Yost - all three were involved in Band of Brothers, one of the highest rated programs of all time.  Boomtown isn't at the level of HBO, but the quality of work from these three men is apparent here.I've watched many many canceled shows and found that many didn't deserve their fate.  Meanwhile, bad shows - King of Queens was on for 9 seasons(!)- remain on the air.  Boomtown is on the same list with Firefly, Wonderfalls, and many others.  It's curse was that it came out right around the time reality TV started to hit it big. It was then trounced by the dreck that curses us even now.If you like good TV, check out Boomtown.",5,"From some of the same people who gave us ""Band of Brothers.""
