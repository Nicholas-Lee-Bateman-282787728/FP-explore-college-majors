Morse is highly intellectual and very pragmatic with a softer side peering through his hard exterior.  While Lewis provides intelligence, humor, and vulnerability that Morse finds irritating all too often.  Their episodic challenges are so complex and detailed.  American television is just now catching onto the hows ands whys of British television being so successful.  And British mysteries are so engrossing, just like Morse and Lewis.  I am going to miss these two when the final season is over.  There is the continuation with Lewis in the lead - which is great too.

737051,A3CSDBDV77Z0VI,B00008AORL,lily t.,"[1, 1]","In Dead on Time, Morse is confronted with The Woman, who left him when he was a student at Oxford. He fell apart afterward and lost his place in the world, but she married a Don and lived happily for many years until her husband became immobile due to a degenerative disease. In this episode, the Don seemingly commits suicide  prior to becoming completely incapacitated- or did he do it? Morse tries to solve the case, but his love for The Woman blinds him to the truth.  Morse and Lewis are at their most heartfelt. Superb and mature.In Cherubim and Seraphim, Morse's sixteen year old niece commits suicide and Morse is plunged into the youth culture of the 1990's which includes raves and ecstasy. Very good.Death of the Self gives us Michael Kitchen as a reformed conman who conducts seminars into self knowledge for the unhappy rich in Italy . But after a murder on the course, suspicions are raised. Morse isn't buying into his conversion and has the help of a beautiful and gifted opera singer as he and Lewis go on location to Italy to solve the case. Gorgeous settings abound.A triple murder occurs in Happy Families, a story of a most  unhappy family and their blighted inheritance. Excellent performance from Anna Massey as the mother and the young Rupert Graves as an odious reporter who gives Morse a great deal of grief over the case.",5,A must for Morse and Endeavour fans,1382572800,"10 24, 2013",2013,1348,"['Dead', 'Time', 'Morse', 'confronted', 'Woman', 'who', 'left', 'when', 'was', 'student', 'Oxford', 'fell', 'apart', 'afterward', 'lost', 'place', 'world', 'married', 'Don', 'lived', 'happily', 'many', 'years', 'husband', 'became', 'immobile', 'due', 'degenerative', 'disease', 'episode', 'Don', 'seemingly', 'suicide', 'prior', 'becoming', 'completely', 'incapacitated-', 'did', 'do', 'Morse', 'solve', 'case', 'love', 'Woman', 'truth', 'Morse', 'Lewis', 'are', 'most', 'heartfelt', 'Superb', 'mature.In', 'Cherubim', 'Seraphim', 'Morse', 'sixteen', 'year', 'old', 'niece', 'commits', 'suicide', 'Morse', 'plunged', 'youth', 'culture', '1990', 'raves', 'ecstasy', 'Very', 'good.Death', 'Self', 'Michael', 'Kitchen', 'reformed', 'conman', 'who', 'seminars', 'self', 'knowledge', 'unhappy', 'rich', 'Italy', 'murder', 'course', 'suspicions', 'are', 'raised', 'Morse', ""n't"", 'buying', 'conversion', 'help', 'beautiful', 'gifted', 'opera', 'singer', 'Lewis', 'go', 'location', 'Italy', 'solve', 'case', 'Gorgeous', 'settings', 'abound.A', 'triple', 'murder', 'Happy', 'Families', 'story', 'most', 'unhappy', 'family', 'blighted', 'inheritance', 'Excellent', 'performance', 'Anna', 'Massey', 'mother', 'young', 'Rupert', 'Graves', 'odious', 'reporter', 'who', 'Morse', 'great', 'deal', 'grief', 'case']",Inspector Morse - Happy Families

Absence of virtue could easily describe this mystery, as most of the principals in this story have significantly flawed characters and/or dark secrets.  Morse's tendency not to suffer fools gladly is prominently displayed, as illustrated by his relationship with journalists who focus unusual attention upon him while covering multiple murders in the same wealthly family.  Morse is also confronted with dealing with a temporary Chief Superintendant while his own boss is on vacation. The frustration level of Morse is palpable as he is faced with a vexing case, intrusive journalists, and a less than empathetic supervisor.  In the end, however, the cerebral approach of Inspector Morse is vindicated.
