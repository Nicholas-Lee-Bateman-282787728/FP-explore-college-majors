838356,ADPH1IF1SOGRU,B0002JUW16,Christopher Glenn,"[7, 11]","This DVD is pretty boring and is an obvious attempt to cash in once more on die-hard KISS fans.  Even when he tries to be funny, he just simply isn't.  Also, I disagree with most of the things said.  I'm not bashing the DVD for that, though, because his opinions are HIS opinions.  I'm only giving it 2 stars because it just simply is not very entertaining, and he dosen't say much that I haven't already heard him say before.  I immediately listed my copy for sale on Half dot com after viewing it.  Stick with the music Gene.",2,Not entertaining at all...,1106524800,"01 24, 2005",2005,527,"['DVD', 'pretty', 'boring', 'obvious', 'attempt', 'cash', 'once', 'more', 'die-hard', 'KISS', 'fans', 'Even', 'when', 'be', 'funny', 'just', 'simply', ""n't"", 'Also', 'disagree', 'most', 'things', 'said', ""'m"", 'not', 'bashing', 'DVD', 'though', 'opinions', 'are', 'HIS', 'opinions', ""'m"", 'only', 'giving', '2', 'stars', 'just', 'simply', 'not', 'very', 'entertaining', 'dose', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'heard', 'say', 'immediately', 'listed', 'copy', 'sale', 'Half', 'dot', 'com', 'viewing', 'Stick', 'music', 'Gene']",Speaking In Tongues

But on ""Tongues"" Simmons is much more interested in promoting a more startling, or brash, persona than he does on 'Jewels,' and for me it's less interesting for that.This DVD is much more obviously self-aggrandizing, if less can be said of anything Simmons produces -- for instance, his jokes before the live audiences are smile-worthy, but obviously not worth the BIG laughs he seemingly gets out of them; one suspects the laughter is heavily dubbed or edited-in.There are genuinely interesting/thought-provoking tidbits here and there, but you get this better and more sincerely in 'Jewels,' which by the way I think is just great.  I even have 75-year-old friends that I've gotten hooked on it, because it's so genuinely clever and lovable.The video for 'Firestarter' is pretty fun, but overall this DVD is a step down from the high standard set by 'Family Jewels' IMO.",3,Not as entertaining or sincere as 'Family Jewels',1192752000,"10 19, 2007",2007,953,"['DVD', 'Simmons', 'Family', 'Jewels', 'sort', 'prototype', 'Tongues', 'Simmons', 'much', 'more', 'interested', 'promoting', 'more', 'startling', 'brash', 'persona', ""'Jewels"", 'less', 'interesting', 'that.This', 'DVD', 'much', 'more', 'obviously', 'self-aggrandizing', 'less', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'anything', 'Simmons', 'instance', 'jokes', 'live', 'audiences', 'are', 'smile-worthy', 'obviously', 'not', 'BIG', 'seemingly', 'one', 'laughter', 'heavily', 'dubbed', 'edited-in.There', 'are', 'genuinely', 'interesting/thought-provoking', 'tidbits', 'here', 'there', 'get', 'better', 'more', 'sincerely', ""'Jewels"", 'way', 'think', 'just', 'great', 'even', 'have', '75-year-old', 'friends', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'hooked', 'so', 'genuinely', 'clever', 'lovable.The', 'video', ""'Firestarter"", 'pretty', 'fun', 'DVD', 'step', 'down', 'high', 'standard', 'set', ""'Family"", 'Jewels', 'IMO']",Speaking In Tongues

838360,AKP40TIE5SVSQ,B0002JUW16,Some Gravity,"[7, 7]","For about thirty years, Gene Simmons has been one of the most famous AND one of the most infamous men in America.He has gained a little bit of a good and a bad reputation, and has also been credited as one of most succesful and one of the best businnesmen of all time. Ever wonder what goes on in both the life and the mind of Gene Simmons? Then this DVD will do great for you;in a way,it is kind of an updated autobiography ever since Simmons released both of his autobiographies, ""KISS and Make-Up"" and ""Sex,Money, KISS"". Read on for my review of this:This DVD shows Gene Simmons speaking in Australia for his lecture tour, which he usually does about every year. When Gene Simmons makes these speeches, he does not act like The Demon in KISS, nor does he act like John Kerry or Al Gore. He shows and talks about the side of him that gave him reasons for giving him somewhat of a good reputation. You get to see/hear Simmons talk about his life(childhood,pre and post KISS, as well as some of the things he has done during his spare time from KISS)and he discusses money, success,fame,KISS, as well as girls(supposedly his favorite topic of all time)and he shares what lead to him becoming a musician, some of the hard times in his childhood and how it got him to where he is today, and he even gives advice on dating-Gene,please don't become or try to become Dr. Phil,and some of the advice is obvious(smart people know not to cheat on their boyfriends/girlfriends or their husbands/wifes!)but the advice isn't bad, although I would make my dating decisions based on what I thoght would be the smart thing to do instead of what someone else thought I should do.The rest of this DVD is pretty cool. You get a tour of Simmons' mansion in Beverly Hills, California, you will meet Shannon Tweed(his girlfriend), their two children(Nicholas and Sophie)and see how much Simmons has accomplished-he has a VERY cool house.As for the other things here,it also shows a behind the scenes look into the making of the ""Firestarter"" music video and the actual video itself,you get to see what the promo party supporting Gene's most recent solo album(...)was like, and there are came appearances by  several different people, some of which include Poison guitaritst C.C. Deville, current KISS drummer Eric Singer and guitarist Tommy Thayer,John 5(Marilyn Manson's bass player, who attended Gene's promo party last year in L.A.)as well as (believe it or not)Ron Jeremy. Not really a surprise and maybe not even a stretch.Overall, this is a very cool DVD, and if you are the die hard Gene Simmons fanatic that I am(I have been lucky enough to get his autograph PERSONALIZED more than once)then this DVD is for you. Some people are probably and have already been rolling their eyes at this DVD, but this is a really informative look at the life of Gene Simmons, and love him or hate him, you have to respect the facts that he has never touched drugs and that he is somewhat active in politics. Like I already said, this is kind of Gene's two autobiographies updated and revisited on DVD with a bunch of bonus material,which makes this an excellent package. Also, look for Gene's ""Gene Simmons 100 box set"" that will have 100 Simmons songs that have never been released,and some of those songs were included as background music for this DVD!A treat for all KISS/Gene Simmons fans.",5,An interesting look at an Icon,1117152000,"05 27, 2005",2005,3364,"['thirty', 'years', 'Gene', 'Simmons', 'been', 'one', 'most', 'famous', 'one', 'most', 'infamous', 'men', 'America.He', 'gained', 'little', 'bit', 'good', 'bad', 'reputation', 'also', 'been', 'credited', 'one', 'most', 'succesful', 'one', 'best', 'businnesmen', 'time', 'Ever', 'wonder', 'what', 'life', 'mind', 'Gene', 'Simmons', 'Then', 'DVD', 'will', 'do', 'great', 'way', 'kind', 'updated', 'autobiography', 'ever', 'Simmons', 'released', 'autobiographies', 'KISS', 'Make-Up', 'Sex', 'Money', 'KISS', 'Read', 'review', 'DVD', 'Gene', 'Simmons', 'speaking', 'Australia', 'lecture', 'tour', 'usually', 'year', 'When', 'Gene', 'Simmons', 'speeches', 'not', 'act', 'Demon', 'KISS', 'act', 'John', 'Kerry', 'Al', 'Gore', 'talks', 'side', 'gave', 'reasons', 'giving', 'somewhat', 'good', 'reputation', 'get', 'see/hear', 'Simmons', 'talk', 'life', 'childhood', 'pre', 'post', 'KISS', 'as', 'well', 'things', 'done', 'spare', 'time', 'KISS', 'money', 'success', 'fame', 'KISS', 'as', 'well', 'girls', 'supposedly', 'favorite', 'topic', 'time', 'shares', 'what', 'lead', 'becoming', 'musician', 'hard', 'times', 'childhood', 'how', 'got', 'where', 'today', 'even', 'advice', 'dating-Gene', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'become', 'try', 'become', 'Dr.', 'Phil', 'advice', 'obvious', 'smart', 'people', 'know', 'not', 'cheat', 'boyfriends/girlfriends', 'husbands/wifes', 'advice', ""n't"", 'bad', 'would', 'make', 'dating', 'decisions', 'based', 'what', 'thoght', 'would', 'be', 'smart', 'thing', 'do', 'instead', 'what', 'someone', 'else', 'thought', 'should', 'do.The', 'rest', 'DVD', 'pretty', 'cool', 'get', 'tour', 'Simmons', 'mansion', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'California', 'will', 'meet', 'Shannon', 'Tweed', 'girlfriend', 'two', 'children', 'Nicholas', 'Sophie', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'Simmons', 'accomplished-he', 'VERY', 'cool', 'house.As', 'other', 'things', 'here', 'also', 'scenes', 'look', 'making', 'Firestarter', 'music', 'video', 'actual', 'video', 'get', 'see', 'what', 'promo', 'party', 'supporting', 'Gene', 'most', 'recent', 'solo', 'album', 'was', 'are', 'came', 'appearances', 'several', 'different', 'people', 'include', 'Poison', 'guitaritst', 'C.C', 'Deville', 'current', 'KISS', 'drummer', 'Eric', 'Singer', 'guitarist', 'Tommy', 'Thayer', 'John', '5', 'Marilyn', 'Manson', 'bass', 'player', 'who', 'attended', 'Gene', 'promo', 'party', 'last', 'year', 'L.A.', 'as', 'well', 'believe', 'not', 'Ron', 'Jeremy', 'Not', 'really', 'surprise', 'maybe', 'not', 'even', 'stretch.Overall', 'very', 'cool', 'DVD', 'are', 'die', 'hard', 'Gene', 'Simmons', 'fanatic', 'am', 'have', 'been', 'lucky', 'enough', 'get', 'autograph', 'PERSONALIZED', 'more', 'once', 'then', 'DVD', 'people', 'are', 'probably', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'rolling', 'eyes', 'DVD', 'really', 'informative', 'look', 'life', 'Gene', 'Simmons', 'love', 'hate', 'have', 'respect', 'facts', 'never', 'touched', 'drugs', 'somewhat', 'active', 'politics', 'already', 'said', 'kind', 'Gene', 'two', 'autobiographies', 'updated', 'revisited', 'DVD', 'bunch', 'bonus', 'material', 'excellent', 'package', 'Also', 'look', 'Gene', 'Gene', 'Simmons', '100', 'box', 'set', 'will', 'have', '100', 'Simmons', 'songs', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'released', 'songs', 'were', 'included', 'background', 'music', 'DVD', 'treat', 'KISS/Gene', 'Simmons', 'fans']",Speaking In Tongues
