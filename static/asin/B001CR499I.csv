1177430,A3UYVLBDDVZFP0,B001CR499I,Daniel A Goldman,"[0, 2]","This review is for ""The War of the World"" DVD. It has three segments, about 60 minutes each.I was disappointed by this DVD. Other reviews saying ""must see"" and ""should be required viewing in every high school"" are nonsense, IMO. This DVD is a gross oversimplification and misrepresentation of 20th century history, and poorly produced. I think students would be poorly served by watching this DVD.A main thesis is that the 20th century was a ""single, unrelenting war of the world"", that there was a ""global hundred years war"". That's nonsense. How can the Japanese Russian War, WWI, WWII, Vietnam, Cambodian genocide, Bosnian war and various other conflicts shown all be part of the same war? They are not. Obviously, there is some relation between the wars, and some of the countries are the same, but the reality is much more complex.The DVD takes a well-established truth, that WWI and WWII were closely related, and tries to turn it into an over-arching notion of the 20th century as a ""global 100 years war"" that falls flat on it's face.As indicated by the title and spelled out repeatedly, the DVD asserts that 20th century wars played out the scenario of HG Wells' ""War of the Worlds"", except that the ""Martians"" were humans. This is an incredible stretch. The heat beam is quite different from the flame thrower. HG Wells did NOT predict tanks, as the DVD visuals imply. The Martians invaded because their world was dying, not because of racial differences. I could go on, but the comparison of the 20th Century history with the HG Wells book is just silly, a kind of marketing ploy. And the author misses the only real comparison that I note, the gas attacks of WWI, which for some reason are never mentioned.The author suggests that maybe the ""good guys"" did not win in WWII, that maybe Hitler and Stalin were not so bad. Later, at the end, he pretty much contradicts himself on this and admits how terrible their actions were.The production is often irritating. There are modern sequences of 1) Russian navel cadets marching along, 2) Japanese soldiers saluting, and 3) the engineer of the Trans-Siberian Railway, and 4) rapidly shifting photos of different ""races"" (but none black) that are repeatedly shown, with jarring music, as if to signify something. But it doesn't signify anything, it's just filler, along with long sequences of Ferguson riding around on subways, walking through a night market to the bemusement of bystanders, or walking around other various sites. There is a relative shortage of historical footage.The DVD makes a big deal of Leon Trotsky's Jewish background being a primary reason the 1905 Russian Revolution failed, that people lost faith in the revolution because Trotsky was Jewish. That is very questionable, the real history is much more complex.The DVD plays fast and loose with the words ""East"" and ""West"", as part of it's thesis that the 20th Century was not the triumph of the west, but instead the resurgence of the east. In one part, the east is Japan, I'm OK with that. But in another part, the ""fault line"" between east and west supposedly lies in the Balkans. Then again Russia is the west and Siberia the east. But Russia is east of the Balkans. And are we to consider Germany part of the ""East"", as it was on the ""wrong side"" of both world wars? And is the USSR part of the east or west? It's all mixed up. Meanwhile, the images of various ""races"" flash by on the screen as a kind of enigmatic filler.Supposedly, in WWII the reason the Japanese soldiers rarely if ever surrendered was that they knew American soldiers did not take prisoners, that the fight to the death was a reaction to widespread American atrocities. Certainly American soldiers committed atrocities, but I think almost all historians agree (and the facts indicate) it was the other way around, that fighting to the death was a requirement of Japanese soldiers in their training, that the Japanese committed many more atrocities, Japanese soldiers did not respect American soldiers that surrendered, and that the American soldiers figured out that Japanese soldiers did not surrender. The DVD is just flat wrong.Many basic facts are necessarily omitted from a three hour DVD (eg, American entry into WWI, trench warfare, military collapse on eastern front in WWI, D-day, countless others) that unrealistically purports to be a ""History of the 20th Century"". On the other hand, some events such as the battle of Kursk and the assassination of Franz Ferdinand get a lot of time, though with not really that much insight derived. For example, it is suggested that Kursk, not Stalingrad, was the turning point of WWII, but that is debatable.There is a paucity of maps. And one of the few maps used, that of Japanese expansion, is shown at the wrong time in the DVD, shows Japan invading the Phillipines in the 1930s. The exact same map is shown later, when Japan actually did invade.The DVD says that the main cause of the wars in the 20th Century was not class differences, but race and ethnic differences. The reality about the origin of wars is more complex. I don't know the exact answers, but it's certainly not the gross oversimplifications presented in this DVD. The DVD even contradicts itself when it notes that Germany and Britain shared so many racial and class characteristics. This doesn't fit the thesis, but just gets glossed over.The DVD asks the question why the German people fell in love with Hitler, while the US recovered from the Great Depression, did not descend into tyranny. It comes to the conclusion that it was because ""Germany produced Hitler and the US system produced FDR"". That doesn't explain anything, is just a silly one-liner.The DVD says there was a ""third world war"", basically proxy wars between the west and communist countries. Certainly, there were proxy wars, but there was no WW III - this is just a misleading literary device used by the DVD. Again, the reality is more complex. There was not a single ""World War III"".The DVD says of WWII that ""appeasement did not lead to war, but war led to appeasement"". That is ridiculous. This is just a provocative one-liner, and goes against the known facts.At the end, the DVD very briefly shows an ambiguous image, perhaps of a Muslim, with the suggestion about a possible start of ""World War 4"". It's so brief and vague as to be meaningless. No matter what happens, the DVD can say ""we told you so"".Obviously, there are some good things in this three hour DVD. Certainly the message that war is horrible and that the 20th century was very violent is worth pointing out. Certainly race is an important cause of conflict, and the enemy is demonized in war. Certainly millions died that we hardly hear about. Certainly every country has had it's share of atrocities, and a ""civilized"" country like Germany can commit some of the worst. But none of this is novel, and I think it gets lost in the inaccuracies and over-simplification.My guess is the DVD is intentionally provocative. This is perhaps a way for Niall Ferguson to get popularity. But I think it should be shunned as factually incorrect. There are many other more factual DVD histories of 20th century wars, with better production values, and with less of the musings of one individual.",1,"Gross oversimplification, multiple factual

Which was fought by the competing Super Powers of the ""Cold"" War era in the 3rd world in a series of ""Bush Wars"".

1177432,A330XFRJKS3APU,B001CR499I,Igor Biryukov,"[10, 16]","The tidal wave of war, barbarism and anti-western sentiment is again rising in the East, accrding to Ferguson's popular-genre film ""The War of the World"". What's worse, it is apparently already here -- in the heart of Vienna, Paris, and London! The final moments of the film, which depicted a group of young ""oriental-looking"" women clad in Islamic scarves with a backdrop of London's double-decker buses were particularly poignant. A picture is worth a thousand words.In the old days, Dr. Ferguson reminds us, the ""Fault Lines"" separating the West from the rest were in the God-forsaken semi-oriental places like Sarajevo. But today, he claims, these ""fault lines"" run through every Western city. Chose your side, he implies. Are you, viewer, on the side of the Western Civilization?Dr. Ferguson spent quite a bit of time in my native Russia making this film, digging for an interesting (and chilling) footage and stories, even taking the Trans-Siberian railroad voyage. The footage is good at times. But his point is that the barbaric and ""Asiatic"" Russians are culpable of starting wars, looks to me very much like demonizing. We all need to stem the tide coming from the East, he implies, to save the Western Civilization from the assault of the ""Non-West"".The Serbians didn't fare much better - apparently, they started World War One by assassinating Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo on 28 June 1914 in an act ""state-sponsored terrorism"", as he calls it. (The real culprit, the Austro-Hungarian Empire who decided to teach Slavs a lesson even though they didn't possess proof that the Serbian State was involved in the plot, has been exonerated by Ferguson)I didn't expect a well-known figure like Dr. Ferguson to become such an implausible cineaste of the pathetic ""Clash of Civilizations"". What a strange thing. Did he forget that the West's ""civilizational"" mission was mixed at best and often dismal?  Did he forget that the Nazism was an illegitimate child, but a child of the ""Western Civilization"" nevertheless? What about Communism? With straight face he tells his viewers that the ""large forces"" like the decaying empires, economic dislocation and ethnic hatred cause wars. That's a very implausible theory. I argue that these forces don't cause wars; they only increase the international anarchy, which in turn make wars more possible.An important link in his logic seems to be missing. I cannot agree with him that the ""large"" impersonal forces start wars. The Great Powers start great wars, specifically -- the Great Britain, Russia, Germany, the US, Japan. They do it, because they rationally choose War. They think that wars advance their political goals, power and prestige. The Great Powers ""think"" like Clausewitz -- ""war is continuation of politics by other means"". Incidentally, no Great Power started wars more frequently than the British Empire. Dr. Ferguson was discreet on this topic, no doubt because the Britons were frequently ""goodies"", at least according to the prevailing version of historical discourse. But it's worth remembering that the Great Britain, rightly or wrongly, chose to declare war on Germany on August 4, 1914 and again on September 3, 1939. It CHOSE to declare war on Russia in 1854 (and invaded Crimea together with France, after some naval bombardment of the Russian cities). These few examples give you the taste, but they are really countless. Perhaps the first war of the 20th century - about which Ferguson was curiously silent -- was the British decision to wrestle control of the South Africa from the Boers.The British war against the Boers was brutal and modern; complete with trenches, population reprisal and concentrations camps. It was an non-illustrious start, which set the tone for the rest of the terrible XX century. Today, the Great Britain CHOSE to go to war in both Iraq and Afghanistan as an America's junior partner. I would not recommend the film - it is an illustration to implausible theories.",1,"Demonizing ""Non-West""",1318032000,"10 8, 2011",2011,3975,"['tidal', 'wave', 'war', 'barbarism', 'anti-western', 'sentiment', 'again', 'rising', 'East', 'accrding', 'Ferguson', 'popular-genre', 'film', 'War', 'World', 'What', 'worse', 'apparently', 'already', 'here', 'heart', 'Vienna', 'Paris', 'London', 'final', 'moments', 'film', 'depicted', 'group', 'young', 'oriental-looking', 'women', 'clad', 'Islamic', 'scarves', 'backdrop', 'London', 'double-decker', 'buses', 'were', 'particularly', 'poignant', 'picture', 'thousand', 'old', 'days', 'Dr.', 'Ferguson', 'Fault', 'Lines', 'separating', 'West', 'rest', 'were', 'God-forsaken', 'semi-oriental', 'places', 'Sarajevo', 'today', 'fault', 'lines', 'run', 'Western', 'city', 'Chose', 'side', 'Are', 'viewer', 'side', 'Western', 'Civilization', 'Dr', 'Ferguson', 'spent', 'quite', 'bit', 'time', 'native', 'Russia', 'making', 'film', 'digging', 'interesting', 'chilling', 'footage', 'stories', 'even', 'taking', 'Trans-Siberian', 'railroad', 'voyage', 'footage', 'good', 'times', 'point', 'barbaric', 'Asiatic', 'Russians', 'are', 'culpable', 'starting', 'wars', 'very', 'much', 'demonizing', 'need', 'stem', 'tide', 'coming', 'East', 'save', 'Western', 'Civilization', 'assault', 'Non-West', '.The', 'Serbians', 'did', ""n't"", 'fare', 'much', 'better', 'apparently', 'started', 'World', 'War', 'One', 'assassinating', 'Archduke', 'Franz', 'Ferdinand', 'Sarajevo', '28', 'June', '1914', 'act', 'state-sponsored', 'terrorism', 'real', 'culprit', 'Austro-Hungarian', 'Empire', 'who', 'decided', 'teach', 'Slavs', 'lesson', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'possess', 'proof', 'Serbian', 'State', 'was', 'involved', 'plot', 'been', 'exonerated', 'Ferguson', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'well-known', 'figure', 'Dr.', 'Ferguson', 'become', 'such', 'implausible', 'cineaste', 'pathetic', 'Clash', 'Civilizations', 'What', 'strange', 'thing', 'Did', 'forget', 'West', 'civilizational', 'mission', 'was', 'mixed', 'best', 'often', 'dismal', 'Did', 'forget', 'Nazism', 'was', 'illegitimate', 'child', 'child', 'Western', 'Civilization', 'nevertheless', 'What', 'Communism', 'straight', 'face', 'viewers', 'large', 'forces', 'decaying', 'empires', 'economic', 'dislocation', 'ethnic', 'hatred', 'cause', 'wars', 'very', 'implausible', 'theory', 'argue', 'forces', 'do', ""n't"", 'cause', 'wars', 'only', 'increase', 'international', 'anarchy', 'turn', 'make', 'wars', 'more', 'possible.An', 'important', 'link', 'logic', 'be', 'missing', 'can', 'not', 'agree', 'large', 'impersonal', 'forces', 'start', 'wars', 'Great', 'Powers', 'start', 'great', 'wars', 'specifically', 'Great', 'Britain', 'Russia', 'Germany', 'US', 'Japan', 'do', 'rationally', 'choose', 'War', 'think', 'wars', 'advance', 'political', 'goals', 'power', 'prestige', 'Great', 'Powers', 'think', 'Clausewitz', 'war', 'continuation', 'politics', 'other', 'means', 'Incidentally', 'Great', 'Power', 'started', 'wars', 'more', 'frequently', 'British', 'Empire', 'Dr.', 'Ferguson', 'was', 'discreet', 'topic', 'doubt', 'Britons', 'were', 'frequently', 'goodies', 'least', 'according', 'prevailing', 'version', 'historical', 'discourse', 'worth', 'remembering', 'Great', 'Britain', 'rightly', 'wrongly', 'chose', 'declare', 'war', 'Germany', 'August', '4', '1914', 'again', 'September', '3', '1939', 'CHOSE', 'declare', 'war', 'Russia', '1854', 'invaded', 'Crimea', 'together', 'France', 'naval', 'bombardment', 'Russian', 'cities', 'few', 'examples', 'give', 'taste', 'are', 'really', 'countless', 'Perhaps', 'first', 'war', '20th', 'century', 'Ferguson', 'was', 'curiously', 'silent', 'was', 'British', 'decision', 'wrestle', 'control', 'South', 'Africa', 'Boers.The', 'British', 'war', 'Boers', 'was', 'brutal', 'modern', 'complete', 'trenches', 'population', 'reprisal', 'concentrations', 'camps', 'was', 'non-illustrious', 'start', 'set', 'tone', 'rest', 'terrible', 'XX', 'century', 'Today', 'Great', 'Britain', 'CHOSE', 'go', 'war', 'Iraq', 'Afghanistan', 'America', 'junior', 'partner', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'film', 'illustration', 'implausible', 'theories']",The War of the World: A New History of the 20th Century

It covers, in a nutshell, the main theme of the book, that race, tensions between nation states in decline and on the rise, and economic depression were the main causes of the main causes of the largest conflicts (i.e., WWI and WWII) of the century. He also drives home the point that no matter what a nation states ideology, when it comes to fighting war, race has been much more important than it has been ""politically corrrect"" to say of late. Even states with very different ideologies and belief structures (i.e., Nazi Germany, Imperial Japan, Britain and the U.S.) can engage in warfare, along racial lines, in the most barbaric manners possible. As Ferguson repeatedly points out using the analogy with HG Well's ""War of the Worlds"", humans can see those of other races and members of other nation states, as little more than ""aliens"" and dole out the same treatment the Martians did to the humans in the Wells book.If all one is interested in is a cliff-notes synopsis of the book, lasting 3 hours, this DVD fulfills that function. Naturally however, due to its short length, it does not provide the depth, nuances and tangents that the book does. For readers interested in these the book would be well worth the signficant investment in time required.",4,Excellent Cliff Notes Version of the Book,1273881600,"05 15, 2010",2010,1370,"['DVD', 'excellent', 'cliff-notes', 'style', 'synopsis', 'approximately', '900', 'page', 'book', 'based', 'nutshell', 'main', 'theme', 'book', 'race', 'tensions', 'nation', 'states', 'decline', 'rise', 'economic', 'depression', 'were', 'main', 'causes', 'main', 'causes', 'largest', 'conflicts', 'i.e.', 'WWI', 'WWII', 'century', 'also', 'home', 'point', 'matter', 'what', 'nation', 'ideology', 'when', 'fighting', 'war', 'race', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'important', 'been', 'politically', 'corrrect', 'say', 'late', 'Even', 'very', 'different', 'ideologies', 'belief', 'structures', 'i.e.', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'Imperial', 'Japan', 'Britain', 'U.S.', 'can', 'engage', 'warfare', 'racial', 'lines', 'most', 'barbaric', 'manners', 'possible', 'Ferguson', 'repeatedly', 'out', 'using', 'analogy', 'HG', 'Well', 'War', 'Worlds', 'humans', 'can', 'see', 'other', 'races', 'members', 'other', 'nation', 'states', 'little', 'more', 'aliens', 'dole', 'out', 'same', 'treatment', 'Martians', 'did', 'humans', 'Wells', 'one', 'interested', 'cliff-notes', 'synopsis', 'book', 'lasting', '3', 'hours', 'DVD', 'function', 'Naturally', 'however', 'due', 'short', 'length', 'not', 'provide', 'depth', 'nuances', 'tangents', 'book', 'readers', 'interested', 'book', 'would', 'be', 'well', 'signficant', 'investment', 'time', 'required']",The War of the World: A New History of the 20th Century
