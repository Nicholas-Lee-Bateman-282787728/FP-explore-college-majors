1135572,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,B00127RAH6,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[3, 5]","""Five Days""This joint production of the BBC and HBO is a taut, yet elegant murder mystery that will keep you guessing right up until the end. When a young mother of three vanishes by the side of a British highway, leaving her children stranded in their car, a family is thrown in upheaval, as is the local police department, which finds the high-profile disappearance to be a difficult case to crack.  Fans of BBC shows such as ""Prime Suspect"" will find themselves in familiar territory here, in a miniseries packed with strong performances by unfamiliar, immensely talented actors, aided by a strong, intelligent script and handsome cinematography.  This show's particular strength is in its fine-grained, thoughtful exploration of the forceful, torturous emotional reverberations that murders can have on loved ones.  The real psychological costs of homicide, which mainstream media often ignores or presents in trivialized or stick-figure form, are here presented at length, and revisited in episode after episode, much as they might revisit the victims of crime in real life.  There's a lot more emotional substance here than you might be used to seeing, and plenty of fine character work as well. You'll be drawn in and well rewarded for your time. It's a bit depressing, but definitely worth watching.

1135573,A29VKODW4R5U7W,B00127RAH6,dooby,"[27, 28]","Agree with all the previous reviews. This is an excellent and riveting miniseries from HBO/BBC. It centres around the mysterious disappearance of a young mother who stops to buy flowers at a roadside stand. Gripping performances all round from an ensemble cast.The search for the missing woman takes almost 3 months. The five days of the title refers to five separate days when crucial events occur in the investigation. It's very good on the police procedural aspect. Something you seldom find on TV is the show's spotlight on ancillary units like the police's public relations and liaison departments.Aside from the central mystery, what I found fascinating about it was how it manages to touch on other tangential topics - multi-racial marriages, problems in stepfamilies, multi-generational families and the sorry state of British institutions today. It's nice to see a show poke fun at the many sore points ailing modern Britain - the need for absolute political correctness, the over-abundance of CCTV cameras monitoring every aspect of people's daily lives, the sorry state of policing, the much derided ""Community Support Officers"", (""plastic police"" whose main job is to issue ASBOs - warning letters for criminals caught committing crimes), the presence of increasing numbers of foreigners, the outsourcing of government jobs (a key suspect escapes while in the custody of a private security contractor) and the dreaded NHS (National Health Service) where patients are left out in the corridors of overflowing hospitals like casualties in some Third World country.Spread over 5 hours and 5 episodes, it remains riveting until near the end. The final episode does tend to drag at points. I'm not all that keen on the ending - the resolution seems to be have been plucked out of thin air, without much preparatory basis. It lacked dramatic flair - there was no ""A-ha!"" moment. It seemed to be simply tacked on to give the investigation a conclusion. That's borne out by the writer Gwyneth Hughes, who admits that she wrote the script as the filming was going on and that she didn't know until the last, how the story would end and who she would choose to be the eventual baddie. Taken as a whole however, it was a fascinating miniseries which had me glued to the screen almost to the end.The DVD is in 1.78:1 widescreen (anamorphic) - not 1.66:1 as advertised by Amazon. Beautifully clear, sharp and accurate picture. Comes with optional English and Spanish subtitles in case the accents present a challenge. The only extra is a 13-minute interview with writer Gwyneth Hughes. May not be quite perfect but certainly well worth watching.",4,Riveting HBO/BBC Miniseries...

Consequently, the viewer is moved along at a very rapid pace and left to draw their own conclusions to a number of events and fill in gaps between episodes.  Given that audiences are usually much smarter than given credit for, this is not a bad thing if done creatively.  Not so here. This approach quickly loses focus and sustaining mood and ultimately leaves us feeling uninvolved and without sympathy or empathy for any of the victims.  They all come across as self-involved whiners - clearly not the intention and clearly not a reaction the viewer wants to have.  (In the extras, the writer defends her inability to weave a cohesive story by saying that choosing five days throughout the investigation and putting the burden on the viewer to play catch-up is more challenging for her.

1135576,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B00127RAH6,Kevin Killian,"[56, 62]","FIVE DAYS is a slow moving but ultimately rewarding British miniseries that tells the story of a drawn-out policy inquiry through a different sort of dramatic lens.  Each hourlong episode focuses on a different day of the case, the first two close together, the third a disconcertingly long time later, the fourth on a day when public interest in the case has nearly lapsed, and the fifth a year after the original police report.  Screenwriter Gwyneth Hughes sets her tale in a British suburb, apparently normal on the outside, but inwardly torn by seething disputes, broken families, and long-simmering racial tensions.  Beautiful Leanne Wellings seems to have it all, happiness with a handsome second husband, three beautiful children (two under eight years of age, and a teenaged girl), and a family heavily invested in community and heritage.  When she stops her car on sn impulse to buy some flowers for her ailing grandfather, and leaves her two youngest in the car while she hops across the road, the tension begins right there.  Somehow, you imagine, somebody is going to nab the kids right out of the car while Leanne is picking out flowers from the strange makeshift gypsy trailer parked in the ""Lay-by"" not fifty yards from a bustling expressway.  But what happens, while shocking, is not what you would suppose!Everything you thought about any of the characters in part one gets turned on its head by episodes two and three.  The seeming closeness of Leanne's family is just an illusion, and the fact that Leanne's second husband Matt  is black serves as a bombshell for revealing much about the prejudice lurking behind the white picket fences of modern day suburbia.  David Oyelowo, whom we last saw in Kenneth Branagh's AS YOU LIKE IT and in THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND, has a field day playing embittered, passionate Matt, despised by his slutty stepdaughter Tanya and desired both by a socialminded neighbor and a policewoman drawn to him against her common sense and warnings by her superiors.Leanne's mother and father are in their own private hell, too, as their gradual distrust of Matt builds up into a tremendous holocaust of hate and fear for the kids.  Patrick Malahide and Penelope Wilton build up thoroughly detailed portraits of these two, written by Hughes as if by Edward Albee on a really scathing day, and when you see Wilton break down at a televised press conference, able to utter only syllables and gasps, you will be thinking of Artaud or Nijinsky, while Malahide does his own transformation scene later on in the series.  But you know who steals the show, the unbelievably ribald and honest Janet McTeer as Detective Sergeant Amy Foster, a veteran cop who's been on the job far too long to have stayed 100 percent human.  She's counting down the days to the retirement and her farewell speech is among the most remarkable pieces of acting you will ever witness.FIVE DAYS is flawed--the directors seem to have forgotten really to keep the suspense going throughout the entire length of the show--and some characters wind up spinning their wheels in familiar kitchen sink postures of deep kitsch.  In addition, you might suppose that the race issue finally becomes too complex for them to deal with, and they scurry away from it into an absurd solution lifted from an old Jean Claude Van Damme direct to video ""movie,"" but don't let these minor flaws deter you from watching this sleeper all the way to the end.",5,Worst Nightmare,1201392000,"01 27, 2008",2008,3445,"['FIVE', 'DAYS', 'slow', 'moving', 'ultimately', 'rewarding', 'British', 'miniseries', 'story', 'drawn-out', 'policy', 'inquiry', 'different', 'sort', 'dramatic', 'lens', 'hourlong', 'episode', 'different', 'day', 'case', 'first', 'two', 'close', 'together', 'third', 'disconcertingly', 'long', 'time', 'later', 'fourth', 'day', 'when', 'public', 'interest', 'case', 'nearly', 'lapsed', 'fifth', 'year', 'original', 'police', 'report', 'Screenwriter', 'Gwyneth', 'Hughes', 'tale', 'British', 'suburb', 'apparently', 'normal', 'outside', 'inwardly', 'torn', 'seething', 'disputes', 'broken', 'families', 'long-simmering', 'racial', 'tensions', 'Beautiful', 'Leanne', 'Wellings', 'have', 'happiness', 'handsome', 'second', 'husband', 'three', 'beautiful', 'children', 'two', 'eight', 'years', 'age', 'teenaged', 'girl', 'family', 'heavily', 'invested', 'community', 'heritage', 'When', 'car', 'sn', 'impulse', 'buy', 'flowers', 'ailing', 'grandfather', 'two', 'youngest', 'car', 'road', 'tension', 'right', 'there', 'Somehow', 'imagine', 'somebody', 'going', 'nab', 'kids', 'right', 'car', 'Leanne', 'picking', 'out', 'flowers', 'strange', 'makeshift', 'gypsy', 'trailer', 'parked', 'Lay-by', 'not', 'fifty', 'yards', 'bustling', 'expressway', 'what', 'shocking', 'not', 'what', 'would', 'suppose', 'Everything', 'thought', 'characters', 'part', 'one', 'turned', 'head', 'episodes', 'two', 'three', 'seeming', 'closeness', 'Leanne', 'family', 'just', 'illusion', 'fact', 'Leanne', 'second', 'husband', 'Matt', 'black', 'serves', 'bombshell', 'revealing', 'much', 'prejudice', 'lurking', 'white', 'picket', 'fences', 'modern', 'day', 'suburbia', 'David', 'Oyelowo', 'whom', 'last', 'saw', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'AS', 'YOU', 'IT', 'THE', 'LAST', 'KING', 'OF', 'SCOTLAND', 'field', 'day', 'playing', 'embittered', 'passionate', 'Matt', 'despised', 'slutty', 'stepdaughter', 'Tanya', 'desired', 'socialminded', 'neighbor', 'policewoman', 'drawn', 'common', 'sense', 'warnings', 'superiors.Leanne', 'mother', 'father', 'are', 'own', 'private', 'hell', 'too', 'gradual', 'distrust', 'Matt', 'up', 'tremendous', 'holocaust', 'hate', 'fear', 'kids', 'Patrick', 'Malahide', 'Penelope', 'Wilton', 'build', 'up', 'thoroughly', 'detailed', 'portraits', 'two', 'written', 'Hughes', 'Edward', 'Albee', 'really', 'scathing', 'day', 'when', 'see', 'Wilton', 'break', 'down', 'televised', 'press', 'conference', 'able', 'utter', 'only', 'syllables', 'gasps', 'will', 'be', 'thinking', 'Artaud', 'Nijinsky', 'Malahide', 'own', 'transformation', 'scene', 'later', 'series', 'know', 'who', 'show', 'unbelievably', 'ribald', 'honest', 'Janet', 'McTeer', 'Detective', 'Sergeant', 'Amy', 'Foster', 'veteran', 'cop', 'who', 'been', 'job', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'have', 'stayed', '100', 'percent', 'human', 'counting', 'down', 'days', 'retirement', 'farewell', 'speech', 'most', 'remarkable', 'pieces', 'acting', 'will', 'ever', 'witness.FIVE', 'DAYS', 'flawed', 'directors', 'seem', 'have', 'forgotten', 'really', 'keep', 'suspense', 'going', 'entire', 'length', 'show', 'characters', 'wind', 'up', 'spinning', 'wheels', 'familiar', 'kitchen', 'sink', 'postures', 'deep', 'kitsch', 'addition', 'might', 'suppose', 'race', 'issue', 'finally', 'too', 'complex', 'deal', 'scurry', 'away', 'absurd', 'solution', 'lifted', 'old', 'Jean', 'Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'direct', 'video', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'minor', 'flaws', 'deter', 'watching', 'sleeper', 'way', 'end']",Five Days
