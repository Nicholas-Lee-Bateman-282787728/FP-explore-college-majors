1224790,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B001OQCVCE,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[1, 1]","""Raising the Bar: The Complete First Season"" is yet another TV legal drama in the mold of ""L.A. Law,"" ""Law & Order"" and ""Murder One.""  Created by Steven Bochco (""Hill Street Blues""), the show focuses on idealistic public defender Jerry Kellerman (Mark Paul Gosselaar), who learns to navigate the justice system and the personal politics of the courthouse as he struggles to get a fair hearing for his clients.  Jerry and associates Rosalind Whitman (Gloria Reuben), Richard Patrick Woolsley (Teddy Sears), and Bobbi Gilardi (Natalia Cigliuti) often find themselves squaring off against Michelle Ernhardt (Melissa Sagemiller), a prosecutor trying to balance her desire for real justice with her need to placate an assistant D.A. (Currie Graham), whose job is to win cases.  None of the characters is painted broadly here, and there are no bad guys among the principals -- just people working in the legal system who believe what they're doing is right.  Conflict, of course, comes from the cases themselves. The big buzz when this series first aired was the long hair on Gosselaar.  For the second season, his hair style is much more conservative.",4,TV Legal Drama From Steven Bochco,1247270400,"07 11, 2009",2009,1146,"['Raising', 'Bar', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season', 'yet', 'TV', 'legal', 'drama', 'mold', 'L.A.', 'Law', 'Law', 'Order', 'Murder', 'One', 'Created', 'Steven', 'Bochco', 'Hill', 'Street', 'Blues', 'show', 'idealistic', 'public', 'defender', 'Jerry', 'Kellerman', 'Mark', 'Paul', 'Gosselaar', 'who', 'navigate', 'justice', 'system', 'personal', 'politics', 'courthouse', 'get', 'fair', 'hearing', 'clients', 'Jerry', 'associates', 'Rosalind', 'Whitman', 'Gloria', 'Reuben', 'Richard', 'Patrick', 'Woolsley', 'Teddy', 'Sears', 'Bobbi', 'Gilardi', 'Natalia', 'Cigliuti', 'often', 'find', 'squaring', 'off', 'Michelle', 'Ernhardt', 'Melissa', 'Sagemiller', 'prosecutor', 'trying', 'balance', 'desire', 'real', 'justice', 'need', 'placate', 'assistant', 'D.A', 'Currie', 'Graham', 'job', 'win', 'cases', 'None', 'characters', 'painted', 'broadly', 'here', 'are', 'bad', 'guys', 'principals', 'just', 'people', 'working', 'legal', 'system', 'who', 'believe', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', 'right', 'Conflict', 'course', 'cases', 'big', 'buzz', 'when', 'series', 'first', 'aired', 'was', 'long', 'hair', 'Gosselaar', 'second', 'season', 'hair', 'style', 'much', 'more', 'conservative']",Raising the Bar: Season 1
