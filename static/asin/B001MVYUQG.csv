1217762,A14MOU9MF0NNVB,B001MVYUQG,"Angela ""Angel""","[6, 6]","This movie is actually the third installment in a series, and Flynn, the main character, is a librarian who goes on missions collecting rare and historic relics for the Metropolitan Library of New York. The library has a secret amazing basement filled with treasures from all over the world, and getting a glimpse of its wonders really adds to the fun of the show.Flynn's character works well because he knows so much and adds pieces to the story through his random factual interludes and references. The Librarian's vast knowledge and love of information really brings the whole story together. He kind of teaches you, and the action and suspense are almost like extras. I doubt that all of the things he says are true, but they sure captured my attention and made me want to know more.I liked the idea of the Judas Chalice having a vampiric history. Definitely a good twist in the plot. I am not usually into the vampire thing, but it was fun and suspenseful and not the boring, same-old stuff we're used to when it comes to those creatures of the night. I also liked the little love story between Flynn and Simone. It had its own little twist as well.Bob Newhart is loveable as kooky Judson, and Jane Curtin is also good in her nerdy role. Noah Wyle really surprised me, though. He's funny and nerdy-hot and an action hero all at once. It's Indiana Jones-esque. I think Wyle makes the perfect Librarian. I definitely want to see the rest of the series now. I hope they make many more.

Noah Wyle (as Flynn Carson) and company (Bob Newhart as Judson and Jane Curtin as Charlene) are on the track, this time, of, not the Holy Grail, but its opposite number, the Judas Chalice, which, as Flynn learns, was instrumental in the creation of the very first vampire, its original owner Judas Iscariot--and has the power to create more of them with no nonsense about biting necks.  But Flynn is approaching burnout after battling evil in some 35 forms and losing several girlfriends to his hectic and unpredictable lifestyle.  When he finally resigns himself to the job, he finds that he isn't the only one in search of the Chalice: a former KGB officer (Dikran Tulaine), assisted by a handicapped college professor (Bruce Davison) who turns out to be a lot more than he seems, wants it to help him restore Russia to her former glory by assembling an undead and unkillable army of vamps.  Deciphering a string of clues in post-Katrina New Orleans and teaming up with a seductive Creole chanteuse (Stana Katic) who also isn't telling everything she knows, Flynn finds himself once again up to his ears in danger and learning some things about himself and the Library (particularly Judson, who may well be just as immortal as any bloodsucker not alive) that he never suspected before.

Both effects seen in countless other fantasy movies the past 8 years.

1217790,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B001MVYUQG,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[77, 78]","- An outraged Flynn Carsen (on having his tuxedo shirt ripped during a sword duel): ""This is rented!""- His evil (yet urbane) opponent: ""Of course it is.""It's always a guilty pleasure catching up with the Librarian, whose job is to guard history's secret relics and treasures, some of these magical in nature and all stowed away in the hidden chambers of the Metropolitan Library of New York. Flynn Carsen is sort of like a modern-day Indiana Jones, except that he's awkward and plenty nerdy. But Flynn does keep his wits about him, and, after years of holding down the Librarian gig, he now boasts experience and smidgens of confidence. This current Librarian may fumble about some, but it's always fun seeing how he'll get out of whatever scrape.The more things change... The movie opens with Flynn at a posh event applying the finishing touches to his tuxedo. He then navigates down a stairway,  sips champagne, and then does a spit take with the champagne. Which goes to show that, even after all this time, Flynn Carsen is still refreshingly hapless. But, after this latest escapade, which climaxes in a sword fight, Flynn Carsen is officially burnt out (his girlfriend dumping him has something to do with it). Back at the library, by virtue of sheer grousing, he gets himself some time off and ends up flying to New Orleans, all gigged out in bow tie and panama hat. So, as they say in the Big Easy, laissez les bon temps roullez.Or not. The holiday rapidly turns into a desperate relic hunt, with Flynn taking on ex-KGB agents, voodoo magic, and the undead. Along the way, he partners up with a mysterious chanteuse to rescue a kidnapped scientist. The relic in question is the rumored Judas Chalice, of which origin dates back to Judas Iscariot and his 30 pieces of silver. The chalice reeks of malice but holds the brew that is true - that is, if you're a vampire in need of resurrecting. And, since those ex-KGB agents have unearthed the coffin of Vlad Dracul, you can see where this is going.What I like best about TNT's Librarian series is that it's not at all pretentious. It wallows in its unabashed cheesiness and farce, even as it hunkers down with a pretty good adventure story. THE LIBRARIAN: CURSE OF THE JUDAS CHALICE is the third in the series, and it doesn't disappoint its fans. Hokey fun, mythical artifacts, indecipherable manuscripts, supernatural villains, and a likable, nebbish, talky hero (even the bad guys complain of his always talking in paragraphs). By now, Noah Wyle's got his part down cold. The neat thing about his character is that he can do something heroic but, then, subsequently have the rug pulled out from under him. And, when this happens, he's so damn good-natured about it.Flynn has had a hard time keeping his lady loves. First Nicole (Sonya Walger), then Emily Davenport (Gabrielle Anwar). This time out, Wyle's romantic interest is exotic Stana Katic, who plays bluesy singer Simone Renoir with femme fatale nuances. Maybe she's a keeper. Or not. Meanwhile, Jane Curtin and Bob Newhart (at his stammering best) are again solidly on board as the museum directors.I never thought I'd ever say this, but I had a better time with THE LIBRARIAN: CURSE OF THE JUDAS CHALICE than with that last Indiana Jones flick. This movie, like its predecessors (The Librarian - Quest for the Spear&The Librarian  - Return to King Solomon's Mines) are tongue-in-cheek throwbacks to those high adventure pictures churned out back in the 1930s, '40s and '50s. I don't think I'm reaching that much when I say that even the score here is rousing enough that it actually reminded me of those Errol Flynn swashbucklers. But, of course, Flynn Carsen is no Errol Flynn. Errol doesn't know the Dewey Decimal System.",4,"Treasure hunts, exotic beauties, saving the world - it's good to be the Librarian",1229299200,"12 15, 2008",2008,3739,"['outraged', 'Flynn', 'Carsen', 'having', 'tuxedo', 'shirt', 'ripped', 'sword', 'duel', 'rented', 'evil', 'yet', 'urbane', 'opponent', 'course', 'always', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'catching', 'up', 'Librarian', 'job', 'guard', 'history', 'secret', 'relics', 'treasures', 'magical', 'nature', 'stowed', 'away', 'hidden', 'chambers', 'Metropolitan', 'Library', 'New', 'York', 'Flynn', 'Carsen', 'sort', 'modern-day', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'awkward', 'plenty', 'nerdy', 'Flynn', 'keep', 'wits', 'years', 'holding', 'down', 'Librarian', 'gig', 'now', 'experience', 'smidgens', 'confidence', 'current', 'Librarian', 'may', 'fumble', 'always', 'fun', 'seeing', 'how', ""'ll"", 'get', 'scrape.The', 'more', 'things', 'change', 'movie', 'Flynn', 'posh', 'event', 'applying', 'finishing', 'touches', 'tuxedo', 'then', 'down', 'stairway', 'sips', 'champagne', 'then', 'spit', 'take', 'champagne', 'show', 'even', 'time', 'Flynn', 'Carsen', 'still', 'refreshingly', 'hapless', 'latest', 'escapade', 'climaxes', 'sword', 'fight', 'Flynn', 'Carsen', 'officially', 'burnt', 'out', 'girlfriend', 'dumping', 'something', 'do', 'library', 'virtue', 'sheer', 'grousing', 'time', 'up', 'flying', 'New', 'Orleans', 'gigged', 'out', 'bow', 'tie', 'panama', 'hat', 'So', 'say', 'Big', 'Easy', 'laissez', 'les', 'bon', 'temps', 'not', 'holiday', 'rapidly', 'desperate', 'relic', 'hunt', 'Flynn', 'taking', 'ex-KGB', 'agents', 'voodoo', 'magic', 'undead', 'way', 'partners', 'up', 'mysterious', 'chanteuse', 'rescue', 'kidnapped', 'scientist', 'relic', 'question', 'rumored', 'Judas', 'Chalice', 'origin', 'dates', 'back', 'Judas', 'Iscariot', '30', 'pieces', 'silver', 'chalice', 'reeks', 'malice', 'brew', 'true', ""'re"", 'vampire', 'need', 'resurrecting', 'ex-KGB', 'agents', 'have', 'unearthed', 'coffin', 'Vlad', 'Dracul', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'going.What', 'like', 'best', 'TNT', 'Librarian', 'series', 'not', 'pretentious', 'unabashed', 'cheesiness', 'farce', 'even', 'down', 'pretty', 'good', 'adventure', 'story', 'LIBRARIAN', 'CURSE', 'THE', 'JUDAS', 'CHALICE', 'third', 'series', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'fans', 'Hokey', 'fun', 'mythical', 'artifacts', 'indecipherable', 'manuscripts', 'supernatural', 'villains', 'likable', 'nebbish', 'talky', 'hero', 'even', 'bad', 'guys', 'complain', 'always', 'talking', 'paragraphs', 'now', 'Noah', 'Wyle', 'got', 'part', 'down', 'cold', 'neat', 'thing', 'character', 'can', 'do', 'something', 'heroic', 'then', 'subsequently', 'have', 'rug', 'pulled', 'out', 'when', 'so', 'damn', 'good-natured', 'it.Flynn', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'keeping', 'lady', 'loves', 'First', 'Nicole', 'Sonya', 'Walger', 'then', 'Emily', 'Davenport', 'Gabrielle', 'Anwar', 'time', 'out', 'Wyle', 'romantic', 'interest', 'exotic', 'Stana', 'Katic', 'who', 'bluesy', 'singer', 'Simone', 'Renoir', 'femme', 'fatale', 'nuances', 'Maybe', 'keeper', 'not', 'Meanwhile', 'Jane', 'Curtin', 'Bob', 'Newhart', 'stammering', 'best', 'are', 'again', 'solidly', 'board', 'museum', 'directors.I', 'never', 'thought', ""'d"", 'ever', 'say', 'had', 'better', 'time', 'THE', 'LIBRARIAN', 'CURSE', 'THE', 'JUDAS', 'CHALICE', 'last', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'flick', 'movie', 'predecessors', 'Librarian', 'Quest', 'Spear', 'Librarian', 'Return', 'King', 'Solomon', 'Mines', 'are', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'throwbacks', 'high', 'adventure', 'pictures', 'churned', 'out', 'back', '1930s', ""'40s"", 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'m"", 'reaching', 'much', 'when', 'say', 'even', 'score', 'here', 'rousing', 'enough', 'actually', 'reminded', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'swashbucklers', 'course', 'Flynn', 'Carsen', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'Errol', ""n't"", 'know', 'Dewey', 'Decimal', 'System']",The Librarian: Curse of the Judas Chalice

1217797,A3H9PLV6L2S194,B001MVYUQG,Jim Davis,"[0, 1]","The third entry in the Librarian franchise in many ways lives up to the standards set by the first two. There is an interesting and exciting story with great action, great characterization, and wonderful touches of humor. The romantic element is also present. Stana Katic absolutely burns out the pixels on the widescreen. She was perfectly cast. Bob Newhart and Jane Curtin are great supporting characters.But in a number of respects this was a disappointment. First, the introduction of fantasy creatures (vampires) takes the series in an undesirable direction. I understand that vampires have been all the rage for the last few years but I think the move to horror elements is a mistake. I had similar misgivings about aliens being introduced into the Indiana Jones series - it just doesn't feel right. I think the ghosts seen in Return to King Solomon's Mines is about as far in the direction of fantasy creatures as this series should go.Second, this film doesn't involve the same amount of globetrotting as the first two. All the action is in New Orleans. There is an opening scene in London but it probably wasn't filmed there. Each succeeding film in this series seems to do less and less location shooting.

Newhart and Wiley are funny together in New Orleans, one of the better moments of the film in my opinion.A caution for parents of younger family members who may want to watch this because of Stana Katic.  It is about vampires with accompanying violence. Another cautionary note for parents; they always had Stana's chest partially exposed either with low cut or unbuttoned tops even in this made for TV movie. Her dress in this movie was so tight you could see her reach down and pull it up just to be able to run in the action scenes.  I couldn't help but wonder how many takes it took in those scenes to get one where her dress actually stayed up and covered her that they could show.I viewed this only to see Stana in an early venture that I was able to watch.  She definitely can sing which is another amazing GOD given talent she has been blessed with.  The character role allowed her to show some skills especially in the tender close up scenes.  I especially enjoyed her final scene, that is the Stana we all became enamored with in Castle.Stana is a beautiful young lady, I like her acting very much, her talent is abundant and is a real throw back to the actresses of the 40's and early 50's who projected the emotions and feelings with a pose of posture a facial expression or a line said in a particular manner.  She can do the same (like she did in the first season of Castle), but today's Hollywood wants the female leads to swear like porn stars, speak with regular vulgarity, and expose body parts to the world.  No young lady should be made to do that just to work.  Stana is way to talented to have to do that, but it doesn't seem to matter to those in charge that her younger fans especially the young girls who idolize her watch and listen to what she says, what she does, and what she wears.  They don't care about them.I pray that Stana or someone close to her will realize very soon how talented she really is and stop all this other nonsense and provide scripts and vehicles for her to really stretch and use the talent she has been blessed with.  Stana is so much better than what she has had to work in thus far in her film career.I look forward to the time when I can view a movie with Stana in the female lead and enjoy the film and her character where I won't feel like I need a shower after sitting through it because of all the filth the movie industry throws at the viewing public today.preacherman",3,Ok for a made for TV movie,1376956800,"08 20, 2013",2013,2567,"['movie', 'was', 'OK', 'sexy', 'good', 'vampire', 'bad', 'vampires', 'really', 'Even', 'fantasy', 'vehicle', 'bit', 'there', 'Newhart', 'Wiley', 'are', 'funny', 'together', 'New', 'Orleans', 'one', 'better', 'moments', 'film', 'opinion.A', 'caution', 'parents', 'younger', 'family', 'members', 'who', 'may', 'want', 'watch', 'Stana', 'Katic', 'vampires', 'accompanying', 'violence', 'cautionary', 'note', 'parents', 'always', 'had', 'Stana', 'chest', 'partially', 'exposed', 'either', 'low', 'cut', 'unbuttoned', 'tops', 'even', 'made', 'TV', 'movie', 'dress', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'tight', 'could', 'see', 'reach', 'down', 'pull', 'up', 'just', 'be', 'able', 'run', 'action', 'scenes', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'how', 'many', 'took', 'scenes', 'get', 'one', 'where', 'dress', 'actually', 'stayed', 'up', 'covered', 'could', 'show.I', 'viewed', 'only', 'see', 'Stana', 'early', 'venture', 'was', 'able', 'watch', 'definitely', 'can', 'sing', 'amazing', 'GOD', 'given', 'talent', 'been', 'blessed', 'character', 'role', 'allowed', 'show', 'skills', 'especially', 'tender', 'close', 'up', 'scenes', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'final', 'scene', 'Stana', 'became', 'enamored', 'Castle.Stana', 'beautiful', 'young', 'lady', 'like', 'acting', 'very', 'much', 'talent', 'abundant', 'real', 'throw', 'back', 'actresses', '40', 'early', '50', 'who', 'projected', 'emotions', 'feelings', 'pose', 'posture', 'facial', 'expression', 'line', 'said', 'particular', 'manner', 'can', 'do', 'same', 'did', 'first', 'season', 'Castle', 'today', 'Hollywood', 'female', 'leads', 'swear', 'porn', 'stars', 'speak', 'regular', 'vulgarity', 'expose', 'body', 'parts', 'world', 'young', 'lady', 'should', 'be', 'made', 'do', 'just', 'work', 'Stana', 'way', 'talented', 'have', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'matter', 'charge', 'younger', 'fans', 'especially', 'young', 'girls', 'who', 'idolize', 'watch', 'listen', 'what', 'what', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'them.I', 'pray', 'Stana', 'someone', 'close', 'will', 'realize', 'very', 'soon', 'how', 'talented', 'really', 'stop', 'other', 'nonsense', 'provide', 'scripts', 'vehicles', 'really', 'stretch', 'use', 'talent', 'been', 'blessed', 'Stana', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'what', 'had', 'work', 'thus', 'far', 'film', 'career.I', 'look', 'forward', 'time', 'when', 'can', 'view', 'movie', 'Stana', 'female', 'lead', 'enjoy', 'film', 'character', 'where', 'wo', ""n't"", 'feel', 'need', 'shower', 'sitting', 'filth', 'movie', 'industry', 'viewing', 'public', 'today.preacherman']",The Librarian: Curse of the Judas Chalice
