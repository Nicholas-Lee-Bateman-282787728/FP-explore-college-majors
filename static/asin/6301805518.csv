That doesn't make any sense for someone who loves Westerns, especially ones starring John Wayne. So why would I quit? Well -- it was too funny, too slap-stick for a Western of my tastes. Imagine my surprise, when a few months later, a friend suggested I watch it with her. I hestitated, but finally acquiesced to her request. I watched not only the first five minutes, but the whole thing. I was in for a big surprise! It was an excellent Western afterall! Sure, there are parts that are comedy, but there are also parts that are nothing short of classic John Wayne Western, and you will NOT be disappointed if you purchase this wonderful flick. It will keep you coming back again and again! Go for it, pull out the credit card like the fast-draw, and fire a shot at this Western! You'll be glad you did, and you can then walk straight and tall down main street, with your head held up high just as if you beat the odds in an old wild west shootout! Bang Bang!

This is one of them, especially if you can see the genre Western to include Alaska. It is, after all, west as well as north, and this story especially is a very frontier story, even though further north than we usually think of as the frontier.John Wayne plays gold prospector Sam McCord, who with his partner George Pratt (Stewart Granger), have done quite well for themselves on their claim in Alaska. George is eager to get his sweetheart Jennie up to their claim to marry her. She's a French woman living in Seattle. George has even built and furnished a honeymoon cottage for her on their property.So George asks Sam to go to Seattle to fetch her back, which Sam agrees to do. However, when he arrives at what he thinks is her mansion of a home carrying a lot of gifts he bought for her, he is directed to the kitchen. She is not a wealthy woman, she is a maid. She did not believe George would send for her, and she married the butler. Now that George is wealthy, she regrets her choice, but what can she do? More to the point, what can Sam do?Well, he's a resourceful chap, so he goes to a house of entertainment, called the ""Hen House,"" and there he meets Angel (played by French actress Capucine), who is willing to come along to be Jennie's replacement (or perhaps George's consolation prize?). But on the ship on the way there, she falls in love with Sam.One of the best comedy aspects of this story is Fabian in the role of George's teenage brother, who tries to be very adult and sophisticated and get Angel for his own. But Angel is gentle with him, and George is a good sport about the fact that she is not Jennie. When he discovers that she is in love with Sam, he plots with her to hook Sam who was certain he never wanted to be married.It really is a fun story, with a variety of clever sub-plots, including Ernie Kovacs as a hilarious con artist who keeps getting conned himself. The whole thing is played with so much good humor that you won't care that it's not a realistic story altogether. And it's great fun to watch John Wayne play gallant to a prostitute. He does it very well: always the gentleman. Well, sort of.

Of course, by the end of a movie like this, all mysteries must be solved, all wrongs must be righted, and the right guy has to get the right girl.Enjoy!",5,John Wayne in a fun Western with a very light heart,1174262400,"03 19, 2007",2007,1420,"['not', 'hard', 'enjoy', 'light', 'hearted', 'Western', 'John', 'Wayne', 'successful', 'Alaskan', 'gold', 'miner', 'Sam', 'McCord', 'partners', 'are', 'brothers', 'George', 'Billy', 'Pratt', 'played', 'respectively', 'Stewart', 'Granger', 'Fabian', 'George', 'just', 'lost', 'woman', 'was', 'planning', 'marry', 'Sam', 'gone', 'kind', 'civilization', 'place', 'called', 'Hen', 'House', 'women', 'are', 'more', 'Sam', 'type', 'favorite', 'saying', 'Sam', 'wife', 'woman', 'who', 'making', 'one', 'man', 'miserable', 'lot', 'men', 'happy', 'enjoying', 'company', 'several', 'lovelies', 'exotic', 'Michelle', 'played', 'beautiful', 'Capucine', 'French', 'woman', 'New', 'Orleans.Sam', 'would', 'be', 'perfect', 'replacement', 'love', 'George', 'come', 'Alaska', 'daylong', 'event', 'old', 'lumberjack', 'buddies', 'Michelle', 'whom', 'Sam', 'Angel', 'really', 'taken', 'Sam', 'signals', 'too', 'Sam', 'out', 'beer', 'going', 'around', 'two', 'tickets', 'passage', 'boat', 'Alaska.Well', 'whole', 'mess', 'more', 'misunderstandings', 'love', 'swindler', 'trying', 'take', 'gold', 'mine', 'partners', 'played', 'wonderful', 'slime', 'Ernie', 'Kovacs', 'course', 'end', 'movie', 'mysteries', 'must', 'be', 'solved', 'wrongs', 'must', 'be', 'righted', 'right', 'guy', 'get', 'right', 'girl.Enjoy']",N/A

Service, and his poems about life during the gold rush.  It's so easy to visualize the John Wayne we see in this movie as being part of Service's writings.Wayne, Stewart Granger, Fabian (???), Capucine and Ernie Kovacs all have major roles, and play them well.  But the supporting cast is equally effective... I don't know the names of the actors, but the characters Mr. and Mrs. Lars Nordquist are terrific.  And Mickey Shaughnessy is perfect as the inebriated miner who once worked the land near Sam McCord's (Wayne) claim.The film is a fun film, intermingled with some nice action.  Some of the scenes seem as if they were copied from photos of the late 1890's.  The scenery is terrific, but don't think that they really went to Alaska to film any of it... it's the best that California could come up with.  The city of Nome is nicely done, right down to the muddy streets.  As you can expect from any John Wayne movie, you'll have a couple of entertaining fights.For those who think of John Wayne as being anti-Indian... forget it.  That is just the opposite of his character in all his films; and is just propoganda uttered by his political foes in an effort to make his feelings less acceptable.  Forget it.  As usual, the only folks Wayne picks on here are the ones who cause the trouble.The whole movie is a romantic fantasy and a very enjoyable one at that.",5,"Great Duke Movie, but would be better on DVD",1045440000,"02 17, 2003",2003,1464,"['great', 'gold', 'rush', 'late', '1890', 'brings', 'out', 'thoughts', 'wonderful', 'writings', 'Robert', 'W.', 'Service', 'poems', 'life', 'gold', 'rush', 'so', 'easy', 'visualize', 'John', 'Wayne', 'see', 'movie', 'being', 'part', 'Service', 'writings.Wayne', 'Stewart', 'Granger', 'Fabian', 'Capucine', 'Ernie', 'Kovacs', 'have', 'major', 'roles', 'play', 'well', 'supporting', 'cast', 'equally', 'effective', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'names', 'actors', 'characters', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Lars', 'Nordquist', 'are', 'terrific', 'Mickey', 'Shaughnessy', 'perfect', 'inebriated', 'miner', 'who', 'once', 'worked', 'land', 'Sam', 'McCord', 'Wayne', 'claim.The', 'film', 'fun', 'film', 'intermingled', 'nice', 'action', 'scenes', 'seem', 'were', 'copied', 'photos', 'late', '1890', 'scenery', 'terrific', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'really', 'went', 'Alaska', 'film', 'best', 'California', 'could', 'come', 'up', 'city', 'Nome', 'nicely', 'done', 'right', 'down', 'muddy', 'streets', 'can', 'expect', 'John', 'Wayne', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'have', 'couple', 'entertaining', 'fights.For', 'who', 'think', 'John', 'Wayne', 'being', 'anti-Indian', 'forget', 'just', 'opposite', 'character', 'films', 'just', 'propoganda', 'uttered', 'political', 'foes', 'effort', 'make', 'feelings', 'less', 'acceptable', 'Forget', 'usual', 'only', 'folks', 'Wayne', 'picks', 'here', 'are', 'ones', 'who', 'cause', 'trouble.The', 'whole', 'movie', 'romantic', 'fantasy', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'one']",N/A

I have always been disappointed in the quality when watching it on broadcast tv and have long awaited its release on blu-ray and am not disappointed but happy to see it restored to the way it was meant to be seen. Just one caveat is the sound. Why was it released in only 4.0 Surround? Why not at least in 5.1 Chase Surround for better quality?  With today's technology where they can even turn a mono track into 5.1 (such as the original Star Trek series was done) would this have been to much trouble for a major studio to do on one of its best (and most proud) and most popular libraries? In any case the movie looks great on my 55 inch Visio screen and still enjoyable especially now that the picture is restored to its former glory.

Most of the movie looks like a western and was undoubtedly shot at a studio lot in Hollywood.  The beach scenes portraying the gold-rush town of Nome must be from Southern California.  The side trip to Seattle looks like it was filmed in the San Gabriel or San Bernardino mountains north of Los Angeles.  The purported Alaska mountain scenes were probably done in the Sierra Nevada mountain range in eastern California.This is a light romantic Wayne comedy supported by the beautiful French actress Capucine and the 1950s pop star Fabian, who looks ridiculous in his 1950s hairdo in a setting which is supposed to be Alaska around 1900.  The movie portrays the standard Wayne script of battling bad guys but looks out of date today because the definition of bad guys has completely changed.Back then the bad guys were con artists who tried to get ahead by cheating at the expense of society.

270050,A2Q13PHEXGR48Q,6301805518,T O'Brien,"[2, 3]","Always known for his tough guy leading man roles, John Wayne takes a stab at a more comedic role with North to Alaska. It's 1900 in Nome and prospectors Sam McCord and George Pratt have struck it big with a claim that's bursting with gold. So with hopes of getting all the gold, McCord goes to Seattle with two goals, buy the necessary equipment and bring back George's fiance of three years. But in Seattle, Sam finds the fiance has married so he finds a different girl, a prostitute named Angel, with hopes of helping his friend out.  But on the way back, Sam and Angel start to fall for each other, arriving back in Nome to find out claim jumpers are moving in.  This was a lot of fun to watch with a storyline that doesn't rush in getting anywhere, letting the characters have fun with the somewhat slim plot.  The scenery is gorgeous, the theme song by Johnny Horton is catchy and will be stuck in your head for awhile,  and the comedic fistfights are well-staged and funny.  If you're a fan of another John Wayne comedy epic, McLintock, give this one a try.In one of his best comedic parts, John Wayne plays Sam McCord, a hard-drinking, fun-loving prospector who strikes it rich. McCord has never had much use for women, but finds himself falling for a woman meant for his friend.  Wayne was an underrated comedian and really seems to be enjoying himself here. Stewart Granger plays George Pratt, McCord's partner who can't wait to see his fiance of so many years. Wayne and Granger's scenes together are some of the highlights in the movie, but much of the supporting cast behind them is disappointing.  International beauty Capucine stars as Angel, Michelle Bonnet, a prostitute in Nome who agrees to travel with McCord back to Nome, but all the while she's hiding something.  Singer Fabian is pretty awkward as Billy Pratt, George's younger brother looking to explore the world, specifically women. Rounding out the leads, Ernie Kovacs is the slimy Frankie Canon, a businessman trying to move in on the town. I guess the cast is okay, but nobody really jumps out here except Granger.The DVD is pretty well put together with a beautiful widescreen presentation that really shows off the filming locations.

The whole film is toung-in-cheek with the Duke finding a replacement for his partner to marry after they find a gold mine in Alaska.  There are excellant fight sceanes as well as the usual plot complications-John Wayne falls in love with his pick.  It is not a 'serious' film that explores life like The Searchers or She Wore A Yellow Ribbon, but it is a great John Wayne Film.",5,Wayne At His Best,1359331200,"01 28, 2013",2013,417,"['favorite', 'John', 'Wayne', 'comedy', 'whole', 'film', 'toung-in-cheek', 'Duke', 'finding', 'replacement', 'partner', 'marry', 'find', 'gold', 'mine', 'Alaska', 'are', 'excellant', 'fight', 'sceanes', 'as', 'well', 'usual', 'plot', 'complications-John', 'Wayne', 'love', 'pick', 'not', ""'serious"", 'film', 'life', 'Searchers', 'Wore', 'A', 'Yellow', 'Ribbon', 'great', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Film']",N/A

However, this 1961 film has numerous Situational Humor, Dialogue Humor, Great Coloring, and Drama as well.
