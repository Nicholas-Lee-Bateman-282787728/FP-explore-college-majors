I remember going to the library book fair every year at school & the only books I would buy were the Goosebumps books. I still have them & I still read them from time to time. I also used to love the old Goosebumps show & I have a few of them on dvd. When I came across ""The Haunting Hour"" I just had to buy it! I never watched the show before because I don't have cable/satellite, but I knew it would be a good show & it was/is! I really hope they continue making more of these episodes. I enjoy watching them, I have always loved scary/spooky shows like this.",5,The Haunting Hour,1381276800,"10 9, 2013",2013,630,"['have', 'been', 'huge', 'fan', 'R.L', 'Stine', 'work', 'was', 'little', 'kid', 'remember', 'going', 'library', 'book', 'fair', 'year', 'school', 'only', 'books', 'would', 'buy', 'were', 'Goosebumps', 'books', 'still', 'have', 'still', 'read', 'time', 'time', 'also', 'used', 'love', 'old', 'Goosebumps', 'show', 'have', 'few', 'dvd', 'When', 'came', 'Haunting', 'Hour', 'just', 'had', 'buy', 'never', 'watched', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'cable/satellite', 'knew', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'show', 'really', 'hope', 'continue', 'making', 'more', 'episodes', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'have', 'always', 'loved', 'scary/spooky', 'shows']",N/A

1548784,A1LBGXE29GG1IR,B0089BSLIK,"Coffee Addicted Writer's Reviews ""Billy""","[5, 6]","Shout! Factory is on a roll by releasing not one but two volumes of R.L. Stine's The Haunting Hour: The Series - Volume 2 to DVD this month. I grew up reading R.L. Stine's books and over the years I have collected almost every DVD of Goosebumps the series that aired during the mid to late 90s on Fox Kids. Goosebumps had a low-budget that resulted in bad acting, cut-down scripts based on the books, and cheap special effects. In other words the series was campy! Don't get me wrong I enjoyed the Goosebumps series for what it was - pure fun.The Haunting Hour seems to be avoiding the flaws in the Goosebumps series by having better actors and directors, higher quality special effects, and complete scripts. Each episode is not based on an entire book but on short stories that appeared in the two anthologies,The Haunting Hour: Chills in the Dead of NightandNightmare Hour: Time for Terror.Here in Volume 2 we get five episodes that aired in early 2011.In The Red Dress, Jamie doesn't have enough to by the dress that she wants to wear to the dance, so she steals the red dress from The Raven's Chest. The store's blind owner (played by Emmanuelle Vaugier) find the girl and the owner wants to be paid, but not in cash!In Ghostly Scares, Lauren likes to visit the cemetery to do grave rubbings and she brings along her brother, Mark, who happens to fall into an open grave and a ghost possesses his body. It is up to Lauren to try to get her brother back.Jeffery thinks his new house is strange in The Walls. He starts hearing strange noises from inside the walls and he sees freaky shadows. There is actually a klemit living in the walls that gives the owners good fortune, but this creature has a sweet tooth!You'll think twice about playing a video game in Game Over. A stranger called the Game Master gives Kelly and friend Gooch a video game called Zee Town, but this is not a normal game. They are both brought into the game where they team up with two other teenagers to fight off the zombies.Alien Candy involves two kids, Walt and Tim who are obsessed with aliens. Two new classmates, Greg and Bonnie, invite them to join their alien club, and of course Walt and Tim join. The twist is that Greg and Bonnie are really aliens and Walt and Tim are their next meal.The Haunting Hour airs on The Hub, which I don't get, so I eagerly awaited forR.L. Stine's The Haunting Hour: The Series, Vol.1andR.L. Stine's The Haunting Hour: The Series, Vol.2to be released to DVD. The show is made for kids, but I was instantly hooked into this Twilight Zone type episodes. Ghostly Stare and The Red Dress are my favorites from the volume as they both have really twisted endings. I enjoyed watching the other three as well. With Halloween coming up, this would be a great DVD to watch and get goosebumps!",5,"Ghosts, Creatures, Zombies, and Aliens!",1346889600,"09 6, 2012",2012,2800,"['Shout', 'Factory', 'roll', 'releasing', 'not', 'one', 'two', 'volumes', 'R.L', 'Stine', 'Haunting', 'Hour', 'Series', 'Volume', '2', 'DVD', 'month', 'grew', 'up', 'reading', 'R.L', 'Stine', 'books', 'years', 'have', 'collected', 'almost', 'DVD', 'Goosebumps', 'series', 'aired', 'mid', 'late', '90s', 'Fox', 'Kids', 'Goosebumps', 'had', 'low-budget', 'resulted', 'bad', 'acting', 'cut-down', 'scripts', 'based', 'books', 'cheap', 'special', 'effects', 'other', 'words', 'series', 'was', 'campy', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'enjoyed', 'Goosebumps', 'series', 'what', 'was', 'pure', 'fun.The', 'Haunting', 'Hour', 'be', 'avoiding', 'flaws', 'Goosebumps', 'series', 'having', 'better', 'actors', 'directors', 'higher', 'quality', 'special', 'effects', 'complete', 'scripts', 'episode', 'not', 'based', 'entire', 'book', 'short', 'stories', 'appeared', 'two', 'anthologies', 'Haunting', 'Hour', 'Chills', 'Dead', 'NightandNightmare', 'Hour', 'Time', 'Terror.Here', 'Volume', '2', 'get', 'five', 'episodes', 'aired', 'early', '2011.In', 'Red', 'Dress', 'Jamie', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'dress', 'wear', 'dance', 'red', 'dress', 'Raven', 'Chest', 'store', 'blind', 'owner', 'played', 'Emmanuelle', 'Vaugier', 'find', 'girl', 'owner', 'be', 'paid', 'not', 'cash', 'Ghostly', 'Scares', 'Lauren', 'visit', 'cemetery', 'do', 'grave', 'rubbings', 'brother', 'Mark', 'who', 'fall', 'open', 'grave', 'ghost', 'body', 'Lauren', 'try', 'get', 'brother', 'back.Jeffery', 'new', 'house', 'strange', 'Walls', 'hearing', 'strange', 'noises', 'walls', 'freaky', 'shadows', 'actually', 'klemit', 'living', 'walls', 'owners', 'good', 'fortune', 'creature', 'sweet', 'tooth', ""'ll"", 'think', 'twice', 'about', 'playing', 'video', 'game', 'Game', 'Over', 'A', 'stranger', 'called', 'Game', 'Master', 'Kelly', 'friend', 'Gooch', 'video', 'game', 'called', 'Zee', 'Town', 'not', 'normal', 'game', 'are', 'brought', 'game', 'where', 'team', 'up', 'two', 'other', 'teenagers', 'fight', 'off', 'zombies.Alien', 'Candy', 'two', 'kids', 'Walt', 'Tim', 'who', 'are', 'obsessed', 'aliens', 'Two', 'new', 'classmates', 'Greg', 'Bonnie', 'invite', 'join', 'alien', 'club', 'course', 'Walt', 'Tim', 'join', 'twist', 'Greg', 'Bonnie', 'are', 'really', 'aliens', 'Walt', 'Tim', 'are', 'next', 'meal.The', 'Haunting', 'Hour', 'airs', 'Hub', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'eagerly', 'awaited', 'forR.L', 'Stine', 'Haunting', 'Hour', 'Series', 'Vol.1andR.L', 'Stine', 'Haunting', 'Hour', 'Series', 'Vol.2to', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'show', 'made', 'kids', 'was', 'instantly', 'hooked', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'type', 'episodes', 'Ghostly', 'Stare', 'Red', 'Dress', 'are', 'favorites', 'volume', 'have', 'really', 'twisted', 'endings', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'other', 'three', 'well', 'Halloween', 'coming', 'up', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'DVD', 'watch', 'get', 'goosebumps']",N/A

1548790,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B0089BSLIK,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[0, 0]","Inspired by a couple of short story collections (THE HAUNTING HOUR and NIGHTMARE HOUR) by R.L.Stine, THE HAUNTING HOUR: THE SERIES is similar to Stine's mid-1990's series, GOOSEBUMPS. However, THE HAUNTING HOUR is much darker in tone and content and the production values are a couple notches above those of GOOSEBUMPS. Volume 2  contains five episodes from the series. Each episode is about 22 minutes in length, including the show intro and the credits. The episodes are:&#8220;The Red Dress&#8221; &#8211; Jamie (Linda Tomassone) is a summer snack worker at a posh country club. She has a crush on boy name Zack (Ryan McDonell) who is a member of the organization. One day she comes across a store that she has never seen before called &#8220;The Raven&#8217;s Chest.&#8221; The store is owned by a blind woman named Abigail Raven (Emmanuella Vaughier). While there,  Jamie sees a beautiful red dress that is way too expensive for her and Abigail promises her that &#8220;everyone must pay.&#8221; Later Jamie borrows the dress and soon discovers that the price is more than she could ever have imagined.&#8220;Ghostly Stare&#8221; &#8211; Lauren (Emma Grabinsky) and her brother Mark (Jason Spevack) sneak into a cemetery that is the process of being moved. The spirits in the graveyard are restless and want new bodies now that they&#8217;ve been awakened.&#8220;The Walls&#8221; &#8211; When Jeffrey&#8217;s (Bobby Coleman) dad gets a new job, they move to a new town and into a new house. Jeffrey misses his old home, but after a talk with his dad attempts to have a better attitude about everything. However, at night Jeffrey hears noises in the floor under his bed. He also hears noises in the walls, but his parents don&#8217;t believe him, but Jeffrey is sure there&#8217;s something else living in their house and he&#8217;s determined to find out what.&#8220;Game Over&#8221; &#8211; Kelly (Calum Worthy) s a major gamer and after beating a particularly difficult game receives a mysterious message that leads him to acquiring a very special video game. However, Kelly isn&#8217;t supposed to let anyone else play the game with him, but he lets his good friend Gooch (AJ Lutsky) play with him right after he gets the game.  The game turns out to be a type of &#8220;The Most Dangerous Game&#8221; and Kelly and Gooch are soon fighting for their lives in a real-life zombie infested video game.&#8220;Alien Candy&#8221; &#8211; Walt (Grayson Russell) and his best friend Tim (Bal Nagra) are really smart sixth graders who get picked on all of the time. They are also obsessed with extraterrestrial life. When two eighth graders approach Walt and inform him they want to recruit him for their special club, Walt feels like his life is changing for the better. However, things aren&#8217;t exactly what they seem to be and Walt ends up fighting not only for his life, but for Tim&#8217;s, too.It's quite easy to watch R.L. STINE'S THE HAUNTING HOUR: THE SERIES, VOL. 2. The acting is actually quite good for a half-hour tv show aimed at younger teenagers.  The production values are much better than GOOSEBUMPS; the cheap rubber masks that were often used in GOOSEBUMPS are gone and replaced by much more realistic and life-like make-up.  However, this is still a lower budget tv show, so the shows do tend to skimp a little on extras and fancy sets.I enjoyed each of the episodes of this collection, but I was disappointed by &#34;Ghostly Stare.&#8221; This story really does end in a horrifying matter but unlike the other episodes on the disc, there is no moral to be told and good doesn't conquer evil.The only extras on the DVD are some original promos and a &#8220;Behind the Screams&#8221; of a few of the episodes.",5,Things That Go Bump in the Night,1399248000,"05 5, 2014",2014,3732,"['Inspired', 'couple', 'short', 'story', 'collections', 'HAUNTING', 'HOUR', 'NIGHTMARE', 'HOUR', 'R.L.Stine', 'THE', 'HAUNTING', 'HOUR', 'SERIES', 'similar', 'Stine', 'mid-1990', 'series', 'GOOSEBUMPS', 'However', 'THE', 'HAUNTING', 'HOUR', 'much', 'darker', 'tone', 'content', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'couple', 'notches', 'GOOSEBUMPS', 'Volume', '2', 'contains', 'five', 'episodes', 'series', 'episode', '22', 'minutes', 'length', 'including', 'show', 'intro', 'credits', 'episodes', 'are', '8220', 'Red', 'Dress', '8221', '8211', 'Jamie', 'Linda', 'Tomassone', 'summer', 'snack', 'worker', 'posh', 'country', 'club', 'crush', 'boy', 'name', 'Zack', 'Ryan', 'McDonell', 'who', 'member', 'organization', 'One', 'day', 'store', 'never', 'seen', 'called', '8220', 'Raven', '8217', 'Chest.', '8221', 'store', 'owned', 'blind', 'woman', 'named', 'Abigail', 'Raven', 'Emmanuella', 'Vaughier', 'there', 'Jamie', 'beautiful', 'red', 'dress', 'way', 'too', 'expensive', 'Abigail', '8220', 'everyone', 'must', 'pay.', '8221', 'Later', 'Jamie', 'dress', 'soon', 'discovers', 'price', 'more', 'could', 'ever', 'have', 'imagined.', '8220', 'Ghostly', 'Stare', '8221', '8211', 'Lauren', 'Emma', 'Grabinsky', 'brother', 'Mark', 'Jason', 'Spevack', 'sneak', 'cemetery', 'process', 'being', 'moved', 'spirits', 'graveyard', 'are', 'restless', 'want', 'new', 'bodies', 'now', '8217', 'been', 'awakened.', '8220', 'Walls', '8221', '8211', 'When', 'Jeffrey', '8217', 's', 'Bobby', 'Coleman', 'new', 'job', 'move', 'new', 'town', 'new', 'house', 'Jeffrey', 'old', 'home', 'talk', 'dad', 'attempts', 'have', 'better', 'attitude', 'everything', 'However', 'night', 'Jeffrey', 'noises', 'floor', 'bed', 'also', 'noises', 'walls', 'parents', 'don', '8217', 'believe', 'Jeffrey', 'sure', '8217', 'something', 'else', 'living', 'house', '8217', 'determined', 'find', 'out', 'what.', '8220', 'Game', 'Over', '8221', '8211', 'Kelly', 'Calum', 'Worthy', 's', 'major', 'gamer', 'beating', 'particularly', 'difficult', 'game', 'mysterious', 'message', 'acquiring', 'very', 'special', 'video', 'game', 'However', 'Kelly', 'isn', '8217', 't', 'supposed', 'let', 'anyone', 'else', 'play', 'game', 'good', 'friend', 'Gooch', 'AJ', 'Lutsky', 'play', 'right', 'game', 'game', 'out', 'be', 'type', '8220', 'Most', 'Dangerous', 'Game', '8221', 'Kelly', 'Gooch', 'are', 'soon', 'fighting', 'lives', 'real-life', 'zombie', 'infested', 'video', 'game.', '8220', 'Alien', 'Candy', '8221', '8211', 'Walt', 'Grayson', 'Russell', 'best', 'friend', 'Tim', 'Bal', 'Nagra', 'are', 'really', 'smart', 'sixth', 'graders', 'who', 'get', 'picked', 'time', 'are', 'also', 'obsessed', 'extraterrestrial', 'life', 'When', 'two', 'eighth', 'graders', 'approach', 'Walt', 'inform', 'want', 'recruit', 'special', 'club', 'Walt', 'feels', 'life', 'changing', 'better', 'However', 'things', 'aren', '8217', 'exactly', 'what', 'seem', 'be', 'Walt', 'up', 'fighting', 'not', 'only', 'life', 'Tim', '8217', 'quite', 'easy', 'watch', 'R.L', 'STINE', 'THE', 'HAUNTING', 'HOUR', 'SERIES', 'VOL', '2', 'acting', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'half-hour', 'tv', 'show', 'aimed', 'younger', 'teenagers', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'GOOSEBUMPS', 'cheap', 'rubber', 'masks', 'were', 'often', 'used', 'GOOSEBUMPS', 'are', 'gone', 'replaced', 'much', 'more', 'realistic', 'life-like', 'make-up', 'However', 'still', 'lower', 'budget', 'tv', 'show', 'shows', 'do', 'tend', 'skimp', 'little', 'extras', 'fancy', 'sets.I', 'enjoyed', 'episodes', 'collection', 'was', 'disappointed', '34', 'Ghostly', 'Stare.', '8221', 'story', 'really', 'end', 'horrifying', 'matter', 'other', 'episodes', 'disc', 'moral', 'be', 'told', 'good', ""n't"", 'conquer', 'evil.The', 'only', 'extras', 'DVD', 'are', 'original', 'promos', '8220', 'Screams', '8221', 'few', 'episodes']",N/A
