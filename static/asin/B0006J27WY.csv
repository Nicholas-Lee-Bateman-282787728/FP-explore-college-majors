870101,A1THLMNCO7TFT6,B0006J27WY,"Alex Green ""alx779""","[22, 25]","I'll start by addressing the absence of the theme song, ""Love and Marriage"".First of all, brilliant job by Columbia Tristar in substituting it with music that closely resambles ""Love and Marriage"", yet not similar enough to cause a legal action. :)Second, if you really miss that song after hearing it 2234342344 times, I strongly suggest you record it separately on a CD, then pop it into the CD player and keep playing it in ""loop"" mode during the opening credits, which you just have to see for the 2234342344th time. Perhaps, because 2234342344 is your lucky number. Perhaps, so is every other number higher/lower than 2234342344.I think that even Columbia realizes now that ""Easter Eggs"" (or hidden clips of the re-union show) was a pretty dumb idea. But, I bet, we'll see more of this in the coming releases, simply because they have to finish what they started. I hope they will eventually do what they should've done in the first place - either release the re-union show separately or inlcude it as a bonus DVD, with the last season's DVD set. Regardless, they have to bring the other seasons out soon. The fans have been waiting long enough!!!On to the actual content. Clearly, the show improves during its 3rd season. The acting is better and the writing is better. I still think that the best episodes are yet to come... This season, however, features some great ones. The two episodes that I really like are ""Requiem For A Dead Barber"" (where Al's long-time barber passes on, and he resigns himself to a future of beauty salon haircuts) and ""The Dateless Amigo"" (where Bud can't find a date and resorts to the next best thing: a mannequin). The lost episode, ""I'll See You In Court"" (which I haven't seen before), is quite funny too. But then which one of them isn't funny?..The picture quality is good, no complaints here. The long-time fans will enjoy watching this season. 5 stars. Bring on season 4! and 5... and 6... and 10.",5,Excellent!

This would be the last full season for David Garrison who is Marcy's husband Steve Rhoades.

There are a few points I must clarify (or re-clarify, for those who IN-sist on ""who-cares""-ing up everything)...1) ""Who cares?"" is a horrible, horrible, HORRIBLE thing to say about anything, EVER! Of course, if you say something like that, you obviously are not that keen on the item (or any facet thereof). As I've said earlier, the old theme is as much an element of MWC as anything else. Those who say otherwise obviously do not give a F.I do, however, think that what they did to the theme was a shame... but given the fact that licensing fees for music are quite dollar-hyperintensive, it is somewhat understandable.Maybe they'll fix that problem prior to release of Season 4.2) The picture quality isn't that bad, considering that these first three seasons are from the 80's. They must've remastered them somewhat. Additionaly, it depends on the equipment (DVD player, computer) you are using.

870106,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,B0006J27WY,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[10, 10]","First premiering in April 1987, Married With Children became a staple of the growing Fox Network's original prime time programming, paving the way for further original creations such as The Simpsons. The total opposite of what a TV family should be, the original working title for the show was Not The Cosbys (a reference to the perfect family atmosphere of the popular 80's sitcom The Cosby Show). Paving the way for ABC's Roseanne, Married With Children more than lived up to its working title, chronicling the pathetic life of a Chicago shoe salesman and his equally dysfunctional family...Married With Children follows the exploits of the Bundy family, a dysfunctional trailer-park trash family living in American suburbia. The family is headed by Al Bundy (Ed O'Neill), a shoe salesman who's lewd, crude, sarcastic, and completely dissatisfied with his life as a loser. Al's wife Peg (Katey Sagal) spends her days watching Oprah and spending what little money Al brings home (she's also Al's greatest source of annoyance). Al and Peg's lives are complicated by their children, Kelly (Christina Applegate), a beautiful yet stupid teenager, and Bud (David Faustino), a sex-starved adolescent. With neighbors Steve (David Garrison), Marcy (Amanda Bearse), and Jefferson (Ted McGinley) dropping in on a regular basis, Al's dreams of a normal family life or a spare moment to relax are continually interrupted by the tortuous reality of his mediocre existence...The Married With Children (Season 3) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere ""He Thought He Could"" in which Al finds The Little Engine That Could, a library book he checked out in 1957. When he goes to return the overdue book, he encounters the same librarian from over thirty years ago... Other notable episodes from Season 3 include ""A Dump of My Own"" in which Al attempts to build an executive-style bathroom in the garage, and ""My Mom, the Mom"" in which Peg attends career day at Kelly's school, teaching the girls there the finer points of laziness and husbandly dependence...Below is a list of episodes included on the Married With Children (Season 3) DVD:Episode 36 (He Thought He Could)Episode 37 (I'm Going to Sweatland)Episode 38 (The Red Grange Story)Episode 39 (The Camping Show)Episode 40 (A Dump of My Own)Episode 41 (Her Cups Runneth Over)Episode 42 (The Bald and the Beautiful)Episode 43 (The Gypsy Cried)Episode 44 (Requiem for a Dead Barber)Episode 45 (I'll See You in Court)Episode 46 (Eatin' Out)Episode 47 (My Mom, the Mom)Episode 48 (Can't Dance, Don't Ask Me)Episode 49 (A Three Job, No Income Family)Episode 50 (The Harder They Fall)Episode 51 (The House That Peg Lost)Episode 52 (Married...

It rocks. Guess what? Not here. For some idiotic reason this set was released without the original score. Must be some copyright thing or something. Totally uncalled for. They should have waited until they got it right.The packaging is also sub-par. I have to pull it out of that flimsy holder to get to the case. At least take after the Simpsons here.After you get past that AWEFUL NEW INTRO JUNK the show rocks! Probably the best season out there.

The Camping Show (All the women of the episodes have their period at the same time during vacation)2. The Gypsy Cried (A gypsy fortuneteller predicts disaster for Marcy)3.

870119,A27RJ30RN5K9MX,B0006J27WY,Mitch Weaver,"[77, 83]","Married with Children is not only one of my all time favorite shows, but if I were to make a list of the top five sitcoms ever made, Married with Children would definately be on that list. The story behind the show never gets old. You have an aging and bitter shoe salesman named Al Bundy who was a big football star in high school that was forced to give everything up to marry his high school sweetheart Peggy. The premise of the show is to focus on the daily life of the Bundy family including an extremely attractive but unintelligent daughter Kelly, a sex crazed son named Bud that never gets the girl, and a lazy dog named Buck. The funniest thing about the Bundy family, is that despite the misery they put each other through, they always seem to band together when times are tough and others are going against them. Despite the fact that they live in a dumpy house and Al has one of the worst jobs imaginable, the Bundy's really do show at times that they are a family. The show combines top notch writing and great acting from Ed O Neil and company, as well as non-stop laughs.The third season of Married with Children is when the show really started to hit its stride. The first two seasons were very good, but you could tell in the third season that the show was heading for bigger and better things. The storylines in the third season are somehow funnier and more entertaining than the last two seasons. A few examples of this are - ""He Thought He Could"" in which Al finds an extremely overdue library book from 1957 and is forced to confront the elementary school librarian that made his life hell; ""The Camping Show"" in which The Bundy's and Steve and Marcy all go on a camping trip and unfortunately for the men, Peggy, Kelly, and Marcy all get their period; ""A Dump of My Own"" in which Al sets out to build his own bathroom in the garage; ""The Gypsy Cried"" in which a psychic tells Marcy that she is going to die in a plane crash, and Al, Peggy, and Steve are all forced to go along because she is covinced that they all have good luck; and ""Here's Lookin' at You, Kid"" in which every woman in the neighboorhood gets spied on by an annoymous peeping tom, except for Peggy and she begins to try and do anything to attract the peeper's attention. The third season DVD set also features the episode ""I'll See You In Court"" that was never allowed to air on TV as an added bonus.Overall, the third season of Married with Children is when the show really did hit its stride, and some of the series' best episodes are in the third season. Personally, I feel that if you are a fan of the show, it would be a shame not to buy the third season for a few reasons. One, if sales on the DVD sets suffer, then the rest of the seasons won't be released. Secondly, since the third season is so good, does it really matter that the original theme is not included? Most of the time, when watching a show on DVD, don't you usually just skip past the theme to watch the episode? The episodes themselves are going to be uncut and that is all that really matters in my opinion.A solid 5 stars...",5,No original theme..

Boy, was I disappointed!The video quality of the MWC DVD sets (any of them) was far below that of other DVD series collection such as Friends, Dick Van Dyke, Seinfeld, even Gilligan's Island!The video quality of the Married with Children DVD's looks terrible compared to them.  The video quality did not have any of the sharpness or clarity of other similar DVD boxed sets from other companies.If you have a regular TV, then the lack of quality may not be that noticable, but if you ever upgrade to a high def tv, you will definitely see the poor video quality.I loved this show, ranks up there with Friends as one of my favorites, but I am disappointed with the poor video quality of the MWC DVD sets.",3,Video quality poor when shown on a High Definition TV,1108857600,"02 20, 2005",2005,902,"['just', 'recently', 'bought', 'High', 'Definition', 'TV', 'collection', 'other', 'TV', 'show', 'series', 'DVD', 'great', 'so', 'when', 'popped', 'MWC', 'DVD', 'was', 'eagerly', 'expecting', 'similar', 'sharp', 'looking', 'video', 'picture', 'Boy', 'was', 'disappointed', 'video', 'quality', 'MWC', 'DVD', 'sets', 'was', 'far', 'other', 'DVD', 'series', 'collection', 'such', 'Friends', 'Dick', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'Seinfeld', 'even', 'Gilligan', 'Island', 'video', 'quality', 'Married', 'Children', 'DVD', 'terrible', 'compared', 'video', 'quality', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'sharpness', 'clarity', 'other', 'similar', 'DVD', 'boxed', 'sets', 'other', 'companies.If', 'have', 'regular', 'TV', 'then', 'lack', 'quality', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'noticable', 'ever', 'upgrade', 'high', 'def', 'tv', 'will', 'definitely', 'see', 'poor', 'video', 'quality.I', 'loved', 'show', 'Friends', 'one', 'favorites', 'am', 'disappointed', 'poor', 'video', 'quality', 'MWC', 'DVD', 'sets']",N/A

A landmark show, wow - I never use that word.There's something new happening with Married with Children.  There is a new theme song for the show!  The production companies couldn't hold the rights to the ""Love and Marriage"" theme song (sung by Frank Sinatra) any longer.  Some TV shows on DVD have had problems with obtaining rights to music for programs - like Quantum Leap and Roswell DVDs have a few songs missing in the middle and ends of episodes - but I would have never thought that this ""rights to music"" stuff would reach this far -- forcing a show on DVD to get a theme song!  I have no idea what the new song is, we're find out when and if we buy this DVD set.Here's some of the episodes that will be included in this set:""He Thought He Could"" - Al returns a library book that is 30 years overdue""The Camping Show"" - The Bundys and their neighbors go on a camping trip, but problems with bears and cycles ruin things""A Dump of My Own"" - Al attempts to build a bathroom in his garage - one of my favorites""Her Cups Runneth Over"" - Al and Steve take Peg to ""Francine's of Hollywood"", but Peggy forgets her bra""Requiem for a Dead Barber"" - When his barber dies, Al grows out his hair""I'll See You in Court"" - This is the lost episode, called too controversial for Fox to air.  It was aired in 2002 on FX, but no where else in the United States.  It was also part of the best of, volume one DVD of Married with Children.  In the episode, both the Bundys and the Rhoades (the neighbors) are taped having sex at a hotel.  Both couples sue for damages""Eatin' Out"" - The Bundys inherits $237, and complain on what to spend the money on.  A rock concert?  Make-up?  Food?  What will they do?""A Three Job, No Income Family"" - Al becomes ashamed when Peggy makes more money than he does at her new job.  Al takes another job""The House That Peg Lost"" - While the Rhoades are away, they ask the Bundys to watch their house.  When they return - there's nothing but a hole where the house was""Married...with Prom Queen (Two Parts)"" - Al and Peggy go to their high school reunion""Life's a Beach"" - the Bundys go to the beach where Al runs into an old girlfriend of his, while the kids look for dates themselvesEnjoy",5,The Bundys,1105228800,"01 9, 2005",2005,2238,"['Ah', 'Married', 'Children', 'landmark', 'show', 'wow', 'never', 'use', 'something', 'new', 'happening', 'Married', 'Children', 'new', 'theme', 'song', 'show', 'production', 'companies', 'could', ""n't"", 'hold', 'rights', 'Love', 'Marriage', 'theme', 'song', 'sung', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'longer', 'TV', 'shows', 'DVD', 'have', 'had', 'problems', 'obtaining', 'rights', 'music', 'programs', 'Quantum', 'Leap', 'Roswell', 'DVDs', 'have', 'few', 'songs', 'missing', 'middle', 'ends', 'episodes', 'would', 'have', 'never', 'thought', 'rights', 'music', 'stuff', 'would', 'reach', 'far', 'forcing', 'show', 'DVD', 'get', 'theme', 'song', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'new', 'song', ""'re"", 'find', 'out', 'when', 'buy', 'DVD', 'episodes', 'will', 'be', 'included', 'set', 'Thought', 'Could', 'Al', 'library', 'book', '30', 'years', 'overdue', 'Camping', 'Show', 'Bundys', 'neighbors', 'go', 'camping', 'trip', 'problems', 'bears', 'cycles', 'ruin', 'things', 'Dump', 'My', 'Own', 'Al', 'attempts', 'build', 'bathroom', 'garage', 'one', 'favorites', 'Cups', 'Runneth', 'Over', 'Al', 'Steve', 'take', 'Peg', 'Francine', 'Hollywood', 'Peggy', 'bra', 'Requiem', 'Dead', 'Barber', 'When', 'barber', 'dies', 'Al', 'out', 'hair', ""'ll"", 'See', 'Court', 'lost', 'episode', 'called', 'too', 'controversial', 'Fox', 'air', 'was', 'aired', '2002', 'FX', 'where', 'else', 'United', 'States', 'was', 'also', 'part', 'best', 'volume', 'one', 'DVD', 'Married', 'Children', 'episode', 'Bundys', 'Rhoades', 'neighbors', 'are', 'taped', 'having', 'sex', 'hotel', 'couples', 'sue', 'damages', 'Eatin', 'Out', 'Bundys', '237', 'complain', 'what', 'spend', 'money', 'rock', 'concert', 'Make-up', 'Food', 'What', 'will', 'do', 'Three', 'Job', 'No', 'Income', 'Family', 'Al', 'ashamed', 'when', 'Peggy', 'more', 'money', 'new', 'job', 'Al', 'job', 'House', 'Peg', 'Lost', 'Rhoades', 'are', 'away', 'ask', 'Bundys', 'watch', 'house', 'When', 'return', 'nothing', 'hole', 'where', 'house', 'was', 'Married', 'Prom', 'Queen', 'Two', 'Parts', 'Al', 'Peggy', 'go', 'high', 'school', 'reunion', 'Life', 'Beach', 'Bundys', 'go', 'beach', 'where', 'Al', 'old', 'girlfriend', 'kids', 'look', 'dates', 'themselvesEnjoy']",N/A

Third time's the charm as ""Married with Children - The Complete Third Season"" has even more twisted fun in boldly subverting TV's domestic nest, smashing taboos and stereotypes as this wildly popular, often controversial hit series breaks all the rules, dirtying up TV's prim and proper landscape on its way to earning a place in pop-culture infamy. Petty, backstabbing, and always at each other's throats - just the way we like 'em - The Bundys became true American icons during their original hit run, holding up a cracked mirror to our own lives, damaged goods and all.This 1988-89 Season of The Bundy's is awesome and was also the season when this show really started hitting its stride, since I didn't like the first 2 seasons of MARRIED WITH CHILDREN when Kelly(Christina Applegate) and Bud(Dave Faustino) were a lot smaller and a lot less better looking, plus this season even had an episode with Pauly Shore in it before he even became a superstar along with the fact that MARRIED WITH CHILDREN was the show that made a lot of people want to stay single and childless as well as the show that every other person tried to get cancelled, due to the fact that MARRIED WITH CHILDREN was quite raunchy and a bad influence as well as the first real sexual sitcom as well as the first real show to come to the FOX network.So you could say that the Bundy's 3rd Season was when this show finally started to walk and that the first 2 seasons are when MARRIED WITH CHILDREN was just starting to crawl along with the fact that this was the season when the sexy blonde bombshell Christina Applegate became a popular knock-out as both an actress and as her ditzy Kelly Bundy character on MARRIED WITH CHILDREN.It's too bad that Sony didn't provide the posting of the original air-dates like Warner Bros. does for a lot of their shows.For instance, the original air-dates to each of these 1988-1989 Season episodes are11/6/88: HE THOUGHT HE COULD11/20/88: I'M GOING TO SWEATLAND11/27/88: POKE HIGH(aka THE RED GRANGE STORY)12/11/88: THE CAMPING SHOW(aka A PERIOD PIECE)1/8/89: A DUMP OF MY OWN1/15/89: HER CUPS RUNNETH OVER1/29/89: THE BALD & THE BEAUTIFUL2/5/89: THE GYPSY CRIED2/12/89: REQUIEM FOR A DEAD BARBER2/19/89: EATIN' OUT2/26/89: MY MOM, THE MOM3/19/89: CAN'T DANCE, DON'T ASK ME(aka KELLY'S DANCE)3/26/89: THE HARDER THEY FALL4/9/89: THE HOUSE THAT PEGGY LOST4/23/89: MARRIED...WITH PROM QUEEN(Part 1)4/30/89: MARRIED...WITH PROM QUEEN(Part 2)5/7/89: THE DATELESS AMIGO5/14/89: THE COMPUTER SHOW5/21/89: LIFE'S A BEACH5/21/89: HERE'S LOOKIN' AT YOU, KIDThis season also takes me all the way back to memory lane to my teen years in the Imperial Valley since I was 16 years old and a Sophomore in high school at Central Union High in my hometown(El Centro, CA) at the time when the Bundy's Third Season was running on FOX.By the way, I just got word that the Bundy's 11th Season is now in the works to be released on DVD this Fall and is scheduled to be released on Tuesday October 13th and I can hardly wait till then either since the 1996-97 Season was the Bundy's last & final season throughout it's
