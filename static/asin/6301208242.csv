246383,A1PY9RTSAL38I1,6301208242,"Chris Bliss ""Sploosh""","[8, 12]","Why do people always complain that movies are a BAD TRANSFER onto DVD? I just recently picked up this DVD for 3.99 in a cheap bin, watched it and it looks fine to me. They talk about it being a bad transfer just because it's full screen, and it's not pan & scan or any of that crap. There's 2 things to remember here ok? it's a low budget 80's film! and was probably re-released by some low budget company. I thought the transfer was great. Sure the movie looked a bit old, but you can't expect them to remaster a low budget movie like this unless it had potential to get some good sales. And also, who in the right mind can afford a Widescreen tv, and if they did afford one, who would want this movie in widescreen format? Don't get me wrong, this is a pretty good movie, but it's not the greatest.anyway, on to my review. I rented this movie when I was a kid, probably a few months after seeing Dirty Dancing, and it bored me senseless. Probably because being around 10 years old, you wouldn't be interested, or understand the story. So recently I was walking through an A & P grocery store and came across it in a cheap bin for 3.99 and decided to pick it up. I read a review on here of someone saying it was a bad transfer and that the movie sucked. Well I strongly disagree. I find the picture nice and clear, and the sound quality is great for DVD, even though I think it's only 2 channels of sound, but it don't matter to me.I would normally give this movie a 4, but since I only paid 3.99 and I probably won't watch it as often I give it a 3. I only give movies a 4 or 5 rating if I can watch them over and over again without getting bored of them. so a 3 is a decent rating. If you like dramas with more realistic stories then this is the movie for you, and don't let anyone sway you by saying this movie sucks, because I liked it. I thought the fact that it was filmed in a small town was interesting and more REAL. So if you relate to small town life, this movie might interest you.",3,Not a bad movie!,1121040000,"07 11, 2005",2005,1994,"['Why', 'do', 'people', 'always', 'complain', 'movies', 'are', 'BAD', 'TRANSFER', 'DVD', 'just', 'recently', 'picked', 'up', 'DVD', '3.99', 'cheap', 'bin', 'watched', 'fine', 'talk', 'being', 'bad', 'transfer', 'just', 'full', 'screen', 'not', 'pan', 'scan', 'crap', '2', 'things', 'remember', 'here', 'ok', 'low', 'budget', '80', 'film', 'was', 'probably', 're-released', 'low', 'budget', 'company', 'thought', 'transfer', 'was', 'great', 'Sure', 'movie', 'looked', 'bit', 'old', 'ca', ""n't"", 'expect', 'remaster', 'low', 'budget', 'movie', 'had', 'potential', 'get', 'good', 'sales', 'also', 'who', 'right', 'mind', 'can', 'afford', 'Widescreen', 'tv', 'did', 'afford', 'one', 'who', 'would', 'want', 'movie', 'widescreen', 'format', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'not', 'greatest.anyway', 'review', 'rented', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'probably', 'few', 'months', 'seeing', 'Dirty', 'Dancing', 'bored', 'senseless', 'Probably', 'being', 'around', '10', 'years', 'old', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'interested', 'understand', 'story', 'So', 'recently', 'was', 'walking', 'A', 'P', 'grocery', 'store', 'came', 'cheap', 'bin', '3.99', 'decided', 'pick', 'up', 'read', 'review', 'here', 'someone', 'saying', 'was', 'bad', 'transfer', 'movie', 'sucked', 'Well', 'strongly', 'disagree', 'find', 'picture', 'nice', 'clear', 'sound', 'quality', 'great', 'DVD', 'even', 'think', 'only', '2', 'channels', 'sound', 'do', ""n't"", 'matter', 'me.I', 'would', 'normally', 'give', 'movie', '4', 'only', 'paid', '3.99', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'watch', 'often', 'give', '3', 'only', 'give', 'movies', '4', '5', 'rating', 'can', 'watch', 'over', 'over', 'again', 'getting', 'bored', 'so', '3', 'decent', 'rating', 'like', 'dramas', 'more', 'realistic', 'stories', 'then', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'anyone', 'sway', 'saying', 'movie', 'liked', 'thought', 'fact', 'was', 'filmed', 'small', 'town', 'was', 'interesting', 'more', 'REAL', 'So', 'relate', 'small', 'town', 'life', 'movie', 'might', 'interest']",N/A
246384,A2N8AFQV49WYJI,6301208242,"Don't tread on me ""Defending the Conservative...","[2, 3]","Why did Patrick Swayze agree to do this train wreck of a movie?  It was horrible!  The story doesn't make a lot of sense.  It is never made quite clear why his character had to leave town.  The story had me thinking that he raped his own sister.  Again, I may be confused from the fact that I was trying to stay awake.Swayze's character is also pathetic in the fact that he leaves and comes back like 3 or 4 times in this movie (or so it seems).  Before I knew it, he was sitting in a church with his family and big stupid smile on his face.  I remember thinking - what just happened?Not to trample on Swayze's memory (I loved Road House and Dirty Dancing), but the man should have never agreed to do this movie.

246387,A1N7TI8FDNROIM,6301208242,"mst3k4evr ""J.W.""","[13, 19]","I am from the area that this movie was filmed in(I was 7-8 years old at the time, in 1987) and I have wanted to see this movie for the longest time. I was finally able to, when I found out about half an hour before the movie started that it was going to be on ...Now before you think that I'm biased about this movie because of it's location and the fact that I'm from there, I have to admit that I first thought that this was going to be a pretty [bad] movie. The first few minutes seemed to go real slow and make no sense whatsoever. There was one scene where the main character's friend suddenly gets mad and knocks a glass of water down for no reason whatsoever. But after a while, I got into the movie, which is about a man that comes back to town 15 years after shooting his father and vandalizing their house. Because he doesn't want to face his parents and sister, he meets up with an old girlfriend(I assume), who is a single mother with two kids. When he does see the family, the reaction is either joy(his mother) or anger(his sister).Without giving too much away, he leaves town after deciding that he doesn't fit in anymore and he goes back to St. Louis, where his son lives. He makes amends with his father and they live happilly ever after.Knowing that the movie was filmed entirely in my area made it fun to watch. There were some places I recognized(like a high school building and the airport) and some I didn't(the grocery store where Tiger worked). There were also places that SEEMED familiar, but I wasn't sure of the exact location. Someday when I have the time, I might take the ""Tiger Warsaw"" tour and look at all the places where it was filmed.Lastly, an interesting note: two of my cousins and my grandmother where in the scene at the basketball game, but their ""part"" was cut out. Also, the two schools that were playing in the basketball game were recently in the news when fans from both teams got in a post-game scuffle over a ref call and will not be playing in any games in the next school year.And that was a review from the point of view of a local girl.",3,Finally got the chance to see this.,1016236800,"03 16, 2002",2002,2088,"['am', 'area', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'was', '7-8', 'years', 'old', 'time', '1987', 'have', 'wanted', 'see', 'movie', 'longest', 'time', 'was', 'finally', 'able', 'when', 'found', 'out', 'hour', 'movie', 'started', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'Now', 'think', ""'m"", 'biased', 'movie', 'location', 'fact', ""'m"", 'there', 'have', 'admit', 'first', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'pretty', '[', 'bad', ']', 'movie', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'seemed', 'go', 'real', 'slow', 'make', 'sense', 'whatsoever', 'was', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'main', 'character', 'friend', 'suddenly', 'mad', 'glass', 'water', 'down', 'reason', 'whatsoever', 'while', 'got', 'movie', 'man', 'back', 'town', '15', 'years', 'shooting', 'father', 'vandalizing', 'house', ""n't"", 'want', 'face', 'parents', 'sister', 'up', 'old', 'girlfriend', 'assume', 'who', 'single', 'mother', 'two', 'kids', 'When', 'see', 'family', 'reaction', 'joy', 'mother', 'anger', 'sister', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'town', 'deciding', ""n't"", 'fit', 'anymore', 'back', 'St.', 'Louis', 'where', 'son', 'amends', 'father', 'live', 'happilly', 'ever', 'after.Knowing', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'entirely', 'area', 'made', 'watch', 'were', 'places', 'recognized', 'high', 'school', 'building', 'airport', 'did', ""n't"", 'grocery', 'store', 'where', 'Tiger', 'worked', 'were', 'also', 'places', 'SEEMED', 'familiar', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'exact', 'location', 'Someday', 'when', 'have', 'time', 'might', 'take', 'Tiger', 'Warsaw', 'tour', 'look', 'places', 'where', 'was', 'filmed.Lastly', 'interesting', 'note', 'two', 'cousins', 'grandmother', 'where', 'scene', 'basketball', 'game', 'part', 'was', 'cut', 'out', 'Also', 'two', 'schools', 'were', 'playing', 'basketball', 'game', 'were', 'recently', 'news', 'when', 'fans', 'teams', 'got', 'post-game', 'scuffle', 'ref', 'call', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'playing', 'games', 'next', 'school', 'year.And', 'was', 'review', 'point', 'view', 'local', 'girl']",N/A
