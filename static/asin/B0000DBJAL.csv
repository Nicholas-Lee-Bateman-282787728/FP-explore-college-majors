As noted, it's actually a composite concert...they've patched together the best performances from a few different shows.  I saw this tour and Brian was in good voice and seemed to feel well and have a good time.  This is a very nice document of that tour but it's particularly enjoyable for Brian Wilson fans who have sometimes had to see and hear Brian struggle to sing well or to even appear on stage.  It's not the best technical video on the planet but it's serviceable.

Have read none of the other reviews as of writing this. What I see here is a guy in his sixties with a voice that can communicate lyrics but is not what one would call a good one. The band does a fine job with instrumental and vocal accompaniment. There is little talk and no electronic fireworks:  just a variety of songs in different moods and tempos. Taking it for what it is and not what it might have been forty years before, I rate it as quite enjoyable, a good evening's entertainment...particularly because Wilson let me hear the lyrics. I doubt if anyone will think of this as a thrilling experience; definitely it is easy listening.",5,For those who don't know there was once a 23 year old Wilson,1260835200,"12 15, 2009",2009,735,"['Heard', 'album', 'using', 'internet', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'guy', 'was', 'what', 'had', 'done', 'Have', 'read', 'none', 'other', 'reviews', 'writing', 'What', 'see', 'here', 'guy', 'sixties', 'voice', 'can', 'communicate', 'lyrics', 'not', 'what', 'one', 'would', 'call', 'good', 'one', 'band', 'fine', 'job', 'instrumental', 'vocal', 'accompaniment', 'little', 'talk', 'electronic', 'fireworks', 'just', 'variety', 'songs', 'different', 'moods', 'tempos', 'Taking', 'what', 'not', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'forty', 'years', 'rate', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'good', 'evening', 'entertainment', 'particularly', 'Wilson', 'let', 'hear', 'lyrics', 'doubt', 'anyone', 'will', 'think', 'thrilling', 'experience', 'definitely', 'easy', 'listening']",N/A

Tubbs,"[4, 6]","This DVD is not a documentry but a special Concert by Beach BoyGenius Brain Wilson - who hand picked some younger unknown Rockers to play the entire 1966 Beach Boys - Pet Sounds albumlive at the Royal Albert Hall, London last year.If you like the Pet Sounds album you will love this DVD becauseits the first time the whole album was ever preformed live! Sorryfolks no other Beach Boys are involved in this preformance!Mike Love and Brian have been fighting for years over the Dr. Landy episode and other hurtful Jelosey episodes etc..  Al Jardine's mad about not being aloud to use the Beach Boy's name after he was kick out of the band and Bruce Johnson went surfingBrain's brothers Carl and Denny are both in Rock n Roll heaven now.Brian Wison was only 23 years old in 1966 and Pet Sounds was his10th Beach Boys album (Amazing) and yes we all know he is a CrazyGenius but some how he just looks like a normal aging Rocker onstage now! I GUESS THATS WHY HE LAID IN BED FOR TEN YEARS so he could think up and plan this concert which is very well preformed by all ( Remember this is the album most respected by all the Royality of Rock: Paul McCartney - Linsey Buckingham etc..etc... )  so they had their hands full,I like it (I saw the Beach Boys Live 4 times) and this is the best performace seen so far by me of their material.I know that the other Beach Boys did not actually play the instruments on the backing track of the album (Spectors Wrecking Crew Did). Mike, Carl, Al, Bruce and Denny were on a heavy concert tour in 1966, but they put the ecellent vocals on top after they got back! Wouldn't it have been nice if the other boys were there too  oh well that's a common problem in Rock (ego) what a shame Mike, Bruce and Carl was not involved in thisMike Love still sings and sounds the same you know and Al's Guitar still works you know. It's like Robert Plant and Jimmy Page deal ( Not even asking John Paul Jones )to play Led Zepplin songs on a show what a waste ( I'm still crying about that )That's only thing wrong with this DVD lack of participationby the surviving members of the Beach Boys.

Purely on a whim, we rented it a year or so ago and ended up it watching several times & plus the lengthy but informative extras before returning it. Since then I have bought the Beach Boys Pet Sounds CD and now Brian Wilson's DVD concert version. Let me tell you, its a keeper! These guys, the Wondermints are spot on! Brian ain't too bad either...This is just an amazingly perfect and intimate concert of the Pet Sounds album - verbatum. I think these guys play it as good or better than the Beach Boys' studio guys did on the original record back in the day. Not only do they replicate their sound, their voice harmonies are incredible. Like I said Brian does a good job also and you tell how proud he is of these guys. Brian is only slightly ""distracting"" with some odd hand gestures and he also sort of hides behind a keyboard that he never appears to play that night...? Its all good. Its actually amazing that he's even on stage considering all of his previous issues. I'm glad he's back! Now, if they only looked like the Beach Boys...Do yourself a favor, buy this. You might need to be just a bit open-minded. We watched the extra features FIRST prior to ever watching the concert - what a story!!! Unlike most of you, I was not familiar with the Pet Sounds album and although I do own a few BB cds, thanks to those CD clubs of the 1990's, I wouldn't say I was much more than a casual fan at most. That has now changed. I coincedently bought a DVD called the T.A.M.I. show. Its a variety of acts performing on one night from an awards show in 1965. The Beach Boy's among others are on this.

An historical rock performance by musical genius Brian Wilson and his amazing well tuned band The Wondermints. Each song from ""Would'nt It Be Nice"" to ""Caroline No"" are performed brilliantly despite Brians older voice which holds up really well. His band the Wondermints perform with the love of Brians music in their hearts which translates to a beautiful vibrant concert performance. Watching this concert you really see and hear Pet Sounds disected live and get more of an appreciation for this historical landmark album. I read other reviews that this dvd should of had more songs, I like that this dvd mostly covers Pet Sounds, the last song performed is ""Good Vibrations"", you pay more attention to the Pet Sounds concert than you would if Brian and his band were preforming other songs in this London performance. The only negative; I wish the other Beach Boys (Carl, Al, Bruce, Dennis and Mike) were on the stage performing with Brian, but that did'nt take anything away from this amazing concert. Brian Wilsons collaberator for Pet Sounds Tony Asher is in the audience as well. I wish Phil Spectors Wall Of Sound (The Wrecking Crew) could have been performing on stage. DVD extras: The Brian Wilson documentary is very informative and a very facinating look into the Pet Sounds creation. The theatre sound DOLBY DTS is an incredible listen I swear you'll feel like your their. I was just glad to see Brian up there on that stage and god I'm happy he is back performing.

Boy was I wrong!!  This performance still blows me away every time I watch it.  I have listened to Pet Sounds for years and also have the Pet Sounds Sessions CD box set, but none of that comes close to matching the energy and love in this music as performed live at these London shows.  The backing band and vocals in this show are far superior and all involved perform with loving sophistication and care.  It is truly a blessing from God to have a live performance of these songs performed nearly 40 years after the albums release in digital video and sound seeing as Brian was probably set to have gone the way of Elvis, Jim Morrison and the other icons of rock history. The only thing that could possibly improve this performance would be the presence of the surreal vocal harmony of Brian, Carl, Al, Bruce, Dennis and Mike together.  I am glad see that Brian and the Boys are finally being recognized for the fantastic work on Pet Sounds and anyone who even thinks they love music should have this show in their collection.
