944849,A3IHJZ22RTXMLR,B000BMGEJI,A. Simeone,"[3, 5]","The number one thing that irks me about this DVD, is that the narrator for the story is the same guy who does the narration for the previews etc. Granted, he has a GREAT voice for what he does, but it just doesn't suit me for reading a story to toddlers.Secondly, the animation didn't exactly match up with how the book is illustrated, there was a bit too much of a deviation and it didn't really quite feel like the book was being read on DVD. But I guess that may also be because the Scholastic DVD stories do stay true to the artwork that is in the books they are animating, and I appreciate that. My daughter really likes a lot of the Scholastic DVD stories, ESPECIALLY if she knows the book already, but despite her love of Eric Carle books, she has zero interest in watching this DVD.Plus, it's annoying to have to skip through all the Disney previews that are at the beginning.",3,I'm sorry but I just don't like this DVD,1298246400,"02 21, 2011",2011,884,"['number', 'one', 'thing', 'DVD', 'narrator', 'story', 'same', 'guy', 'who', 'narration', 'previews', 'etc', 'Granted', 'GREAT', 'voice', 'what', 'just', ""n't"", 'suit', 'reading', 'story', 'toddlers.Secondly', 'animation', 'did', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'match', 'up', 'how', 'book', 'illustrated', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'deviation', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'quite', 'feel', 'book', 'was', 'being', 'read', 'DVD', 'guess', 'may', 'also', 'be', 'Scholastic', 'DVD', 'stories', 'do', 'stay', 'true', 'artwork', 'books', 'are', 'animating', 'appreciate', 'daughter', 'really', 'lot', 'Scholastic', 'DVD', 'stories', 'ESPECIALLY', 'book', 'already', 'love', 'Eric', 'Carle', 'books', 'zero', 'interest', 'watching', 'DVD.Plus', 'annoying', 'have', 'skip', 'Disney', 'previews', 'are', 'beginning']",N/A

I love to watch it with my 2 year old before bedtime. It is the perfect way to wind down for a good night's sleep. She is enthralled by watching her favorite stories that we read together come to life. This is beautifully done with music, animation, and you can even have the words show (you need to choose the option for the hard of hearing, and the words will come up on the screen).Absolutely well done, Disney!

944853,A1GOJL8ZS95UKO,B000BMGEJI,Mom Of Many Munchkins,"[31, 32]","This is similar to the Scholastic Video Collection series but it's not the same.  It's made by Disney.  I'm sure you already know what the stories are.  They are nice and slow.  The scenes are very true to what the drawings in the books are like.  The animation is nice.Most of the reviewers seem to have bought this for kids about 2 years old.  My daughter is 4 and enjoys it.  The back of the dvd says ages 5 and under.My daughters favorite part is the bonus feature.  It's a game called Eating Through the Week.  There's all 7 days of the week and you have to help the caterpillar choose the food he will eat for that day.  Each day has 3 choices and the child moves the arrows on the remote to move the caterpillar to the correct choice.  Then they press the enter button.  As an example, a pleasant voice says, ""Today is Monday and on Monday the very hungry caterpillar needs to eat one apple.  Can you help the very hungry caterpillar find one apple?  Just move the highlight over the picture of one apple and press enter on your remote control.  Great!  You helped the very hungry caterpillar eat through one apple on Monday!  But he's still hungry.  Now it's Tuesday and........."", etc.  It's actually a very cute game and the best part of the entire dvd, in my opinion.  It's too bad that there isn't at least one more game to choose from.  I wish there were games like that on the Scholastic videos, it would enhance them so much.  This is the first time my daughter has played a game on a dvd and thinks it's the best.So, just an fyi....if you are reading these reviews and decide you would like to purchase this, go with the dvd not the vhs.  You can find the vhs for cheaper....but I would assume you'll miss out on the game.  We got this dvd from the library.  I had planned on buying a vhs if we liked it.  Because my daughter enjoys the game so much, I'll have to make sure I spend a little more and buy a dvd.  I know she would be terribly disappointed to receive a vhs and not have the interactive game.I was going to give this 4 stars, simply because it is very good....but I don't personally think it's excellent.  But, I decided to go with the 5 stars because Disney was smart enough to add in the interactive game.",5,Very nice dvd....,1198800000,"12 28, 2007",2007,2236,"['similar', 'Scholastic', 'Video', 'Collection', 'series', 'not', 'same', 'made', 'Disney', ""'m"", 'sure', 'already', 'know', 'what', 'stories', 'are', 'are', 'nice', 'slow', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'true', 'what', 'drawings', 'books', 'are', 'animation', 'nice.Most', 'reviewers', 'seem', 'have', 'bought', 'kids', '2', 'years', 'old', 'daughter', '4', 'back', 'dvd', '5', 'under.My', 'daughters', 'favorite', 'part', 'bonus', 'feature', 'game', 'called', 'Eating', 'Week', '7', 'days', 'week', 'have', 'help', 'caterpillar', 'choose', 'food', 'will', 'eat', 'day', 'day', '3', 'choices', 'child', 'arrows', 'remote', 'move', 'caterpillar', 'correct', 'choice', 'Then', 'press', 'enter', 'button', 'example', 'pleasant', 'voice', 'Today', 'Monday', 'Monday', 'very', 'hungry', 'caterpillar', 'needs', 'eat', 'one', 'apple', 'Can', 'help', 'very', 'hungry', 'caterpillar', 'find', 'one', 'apple', 'Just', 'move', 'highlight', 'picture', 'one', 'apple', 'press', 'enter', 'remote', 'control', 'Great', 'helped', 'very', 'hungry', 'caterpillar', 'eat', 'one', 'apple', 'Monday', 'still', 'hungry', 'Now', 'Tuesday', 'etc', 'actually', 'very', 'cute', 'game', 'best', 'part', 'entire', 'dvd', 'opinion', 'too', 'bad', ""n't"", 'least', 'one', 'more', 'game', 'choose', 'wish', 'were', 'games', 'Scholastic', 'videos', 'would', 'enhance', 'so', 'much', 'first', 'time', 'daughter', 'played', 'game', 'dvd', 'best.So', 'just', 'fyi', '.if', 'are', 'reading', 'reviews', 'decide', 'would', 'like', 'purchase', 'go', 'dvd', 'not', 'vhs', 'can', 'find', 'vhs', 'cheaper', '.but', 'would', 'assume', ""'ll"", 'miss', 'out', 'game', 'got', 'dvd', 'library', 'had', 'planned', 'buying', 'vhs', 'liked', 'daughter', 'game', 'so', 'much', ""'ll"", 'have', 'make', 'sure', 'spend', 'little', 'more', 'buy', 'dvd', 'know', 'would', 'be', 'terribly', 'disappointed', 'receive', 'vhs', 'not', 'have', 'interactive', 'game.I', 'was', 'going', 'give', '4', 'stars', 'simply', 'very', 'good', '.but', 'do', ""n't"", 'personally', 'think', 'excellent', 'decided', 'go', '5', 'stars', 'Disney', 'was', 'smart', 'enough', 'add', 'interactive', 'game']",N/A
