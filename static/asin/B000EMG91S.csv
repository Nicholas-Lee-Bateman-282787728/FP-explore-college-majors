I caught one episode by accident on public television a couple of decades ago and was instantly charmed.  It combines a wonderful core cast of eccentric characters, a very subtle plot and a twist that would have been amazing to see developed to fruition.There was no frenetic physical schtick, no blatant sexual innuendo and no biting, sarcastic wit.  It explored the budding friendship between the title character (with a hidden agenda of his own) and the wonderfully irascible Miss Farnaby (played with deft excellence by Geraldine McEwan).  Unfortunately, and perhaps because of this, at the close of the second season the BBC decided to cancel it.  Would that they had the courage to continue it.  In any case it allows the fans to create in their own minds the way the storyline pans out!I cannot recommend it highly enough.  It is a great series to introduce new viewers to British comedies.

Mulberry, however, at the behest of his father, a mysterious and persistent stranger, has a darker agenda that he must reluctantly fulfil.Geraldine McEwan's poignantly nuanced portrayal of Miss Farnaby is complemented by Karl Howman's Mulberry, whose slightly daffy antics eventually win her heart, while, at the same time, they drive Bert and Alice----Miss Farnaby's benignly conniving servants----to distraction.

First, this is a 13 episode program spanning two sereis, not 9 episodes on 1 disc (unless the subtitle of ""the complete series"" is wrong on the DVD cover. This is backed up by two things:1 - 377 minutes divided by 29 minutes per episode equals 13, and...2 - I have 12 of the 13 from old PBS airings and know I'm missing the final one.Now for the ""he should really stop being so picky"" part. This is an absolutely wonderful program -- as discussed nicely by others. Like a number of other British comedies, this bears up well under repeat viewings. Karl Howman is wonderful as the son of Death on his first and very reluctant assignment. Geraldine McEwan is a joy mixing an almost pixie-like twinkle and sense of humor combined with putting up a front of being a very proper, older British woman.Having all episodes will show the only glitch in the two series, that being the departure of the original actress portraying ""Alice"" and her replacement. I was never really sure why Lill Roughley left after the first series. But a momentary suspension of ""why"" is all you need to get use to Alice #2. Otherwise, I can't fault it.While I wholeheartedly agree that this was an all-too-brief show, I wonder if it could have maintained it quality much beyond a third series.
