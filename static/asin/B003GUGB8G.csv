With that inoond I was open to seeing something new and thought that animating one of the greatest horror films of all time  might be an interesting adventure.  Unfortunately the treatment did not love up to the expectations of this reviewer.  The reason - too many art styles.  If they had stuck to one or two art styles this might have been pulled off.  However, they decided to go with way to many and the whole thing just became muddied.Even some of the art styles were dull and uninspired.This might be a good rent, but I would not recommend a purchase on this one.",2,Interesting idea - poor execution,1285977600,"10 2, 2010",2010,615,"['Romero', 'dead', 'films', 'are', 'favorite', 'horror', 'inoond', 'was', 'open', 'seeing', 'something', 'new', 'thought', 'animating', 'one', 'greatest', 'horror', 'films', 'time', 'might', 'be', 'interesting', 'adventure', 'Unfortunately', 'treatment', 'did', 'not', 'love', 'up', 'expectations', 'reviewer', 'reason', 'too', 'many', 'art', 'styles', 'had', 'stuck', 'one', 'two', 'art', 'styles', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'pulled', 'off', 'However', 'decided', 'go', 'way', 'many', 'whole', 'thing', 'just', 'became', 'muddied.Even', 'art', 'styles', 'were', 'dull', 'uninspired.This', 'might', 'be', 'good', 'rent', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'purchase', 'one']",Night of the Living Dead: Reanimated

Sanchez ""Horror film buff""","[0, 0]","When I came across this version of Romero's classic, I was at once intrigued and skeptical (and I attribute my skepicism to the anniversary edition which included the ""new footage"" including the fire-and-brimstone preacher (as described by one reviewer). But my aforementioned intrigue won, and I ordered this. I guess I was expecting something different, perhaps an ""anime-style"" version. The opening scene in which Barbara and Johnny are sitting in the vehicle talking initially made me say to myself, ""Oh, geez..."" but the pace picked up, somewhat. This isn't really my proverbial cup of tea, but I do give credit for the vision. The live-action sequences were interesting, but the still panels reminded me of the narrated animation version of ""The Watchmen,"" which I found very distracting.Word of advice (and kudos to the production company and the ""Count"" for this suggestion): If you have never seen the original ""Night of the Living Dead,"" do not let this ""reanimated"" version be your first experience. Watch the original first; otherwise, you may be distracted and decide to bypass this classic. May I recommend the Millenium edition? Once you've seen the original classic, your appreciation of ""Night of the Living Dead - Reanimated"" will most likely be much greater.",3,Definitely different...,1322092800,"11 24, 2011",2011,1277,"['When', 'came', 'version', 'Romero', 'classic', 'was', 'once', 'intrigued', 'skeptical', 'attribute', 'skepicism', 'anniversary', 'edition', 'included', 'new', 'footage', 'including', 'fire-and-brimstone', 'preacher', 'described', 'one', 'reviewer', 'aforementioned', 'intrigue', 'won', 'ordered', 'guess', 'was', 'expecting', 'something', 'different', 'perhaps', 'anime-style', 'version', 'opening', 'scene', 'Barbara', 'Johnny', 'are', 'sitting', 'vehicle', 'talking', 'initially', 'made', 'say', 'myself', 'Oh', 'geez', 'pace', 'picked', 'up', 'somewhat', ""n't"", 'really', 'proverbial', 'cup', 'tea', 'do', 'give', 'credit', 'vision', 'live-action', 'sequences', 'were', 'interesting', 'still', 'panels', 'reminded', 'narrated', 'animation', 'version', 'Watchmen', 'found', 'very', 'distracting.Word', 'advice', 'kudos', 'production', 'company', 'Count', 'suggestion', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'original', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', 'do', 'not', 'let', 'reanimated', 'version', 'be', 'first', 'experience', 'Watch', 'original', 'first', 'otherwise', 'may', 'be', 'distracted', 'decide', 'bypass', 'classic', 'May', 'recommend', 'Millenium', 'edition', 'Once', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'original', 'classic', 'appreciation', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', 'Reanimated', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'be', 'much', 'greater']",Night of the Living Dead: Reanimated

1345435,A2KFKSMK9KRKZ4,B003GUGB8G,R. Jurosik,"[4, 6]","With the exceptions of the Romero-approved Millennium and Dimension Films editions, NOTLD-Reanimated is certainly the best thing to happen to this classic on DVD (stay away from the colorized, 30th anniversary, 3D and Blu-ray editions).  It doesn't reimagine the film, but rather ""resurrects"" the film aesthetically.  With each new clip, we get to explore the film in another medium: comics, drawing, computer-generated imagery, puppets, video games and altered video.  The DVD provides just the right context to enjoy it all, complete with audio commentaries, featurettes and a perfectly schlocky (and I mean that as a compliment) introduction by a vampiric ""Count Gore de Vol,"" who prefaces NOTLD-Reanimated while parading around a makeshift goofy-spook soundstage circa 1970.  To me, it all strikes the right tone -- no pretense, just fun and appreciation of this landmark horror film.However, this exquisite corpse never quite equals the sum of its parts.  Many of the visual styles are too often repeated, yet none of the segments is really allowed to come to fruition.  As a result, frustration, and a pressing desire to switch to the original film, can set in pretty quickly on a casual viewer.  Hopefully, this just the start of a larger ""body"" of work, and the team at Wild Eye should know that this reviewer would eagerly look forward to another ""reanimated"" jam session.",4,"Recommended ... with Some ""Grave"" Concerns",1285977600,"10 2, 2010",2010,1381,"['exceptions', 'Romero-approved', 'Millennium', 'Dimension', 'Films', 'editions', 'NOTLD-Reanimated', 'certainly', 'best', 'thing', 'happen', 'classic', 'DVD', 'stay', 'away', 'colorized', '30th', 'anniversary', '3D', 'Blu-ray', 'editions', ""n't"", 'reimagine', 'film', 'rather', 'resurrects', 'film', 'aesthetically', 'new', 'clip', 'get', 'explore', 'film', 'medium', 'comics', 'drawing', 'computer-generated', 'imagery', 'puppets', 'video', 'games', 'altered', 'video', 'DVD', 'just', 'right', 'context', 'enjoy', 'complete', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'featurettes', 'perfectly', 'schlocky', 'mean', 'compliment', 'introduction', 'vampiric', 'Count', 'Gore', 'Vol', 'who', 'NOTLD-Reanimated', 'parading', 'makeshift', 'goofy-spook', 'soundstage', 'circa', '1970', 'right', 'tone', 'pretense', 'just', 'fun', 'appreciation', 'landmark', 'horror', 'film.However', 'exquisite', 'corpse', 'never', 'quite', 'sum', 'parts', 'Many', 'visual', 'styles', 'are', 'too', 'often', 'repeated', 'yet', 'none', 'segments', 'really', 'allowed', 'come', 'fruition', 'result', 'frustration', 'pressing', 'desire', 'switch', 'original', 'film', 'can', 'set', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'casual', 'viewer', 'Hopefully', 'just', 'start', 'larger', 'body', 'work', 'team', 'Wild', 'Eye', 'should', 'know', 'reviewer', 'would', 'eagerly', 'look', 'forward', 'reanimated', 'jam', 'session']",Night of the Living Dead: Reanimated
