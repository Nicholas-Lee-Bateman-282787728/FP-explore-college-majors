21703,A2M3NO8VMO7P0U,0767839145,A. Beck,"[2, 2]","'American Movie' is one of those films that I've seen sitting on my local video store shelf for the past decade but never once thought about renting it.  The simplistic VHS/DVD cover is one that always sparked my curiosity, but not enough for me to actually pick it up, flip it over and read the synopsis.  I always assumed this was some sort of fake documentary similar to 'This is Spinal Tap' and never really gave it a chance.  Bored and looking for something new to watch, I decided to finally give this one a go and I feel like kicking myself in the nuts for not doing so sooner.The documentary follows inspired indie filmmaker Mark Borchardt from Milwaukee, Wisconsin as he attempts to direct his first full length feature film titled 'Northwestern'.  Mark realizes early on that he doesn't have the funds needed to complete the project and is forced to put 'Northwestern' on hold.  In order to raise money for the project he decides to go back and shoot another movie first...a 40 minute horror thriller titled 'Coven' which he started filming several years earlier but never finished.  Mark's plan is to finish 'Coven' and sell 3,000 VHS copies at $14.95 each which would than give him enough money to make 'Northwestern'.  Along for the ride is Mark's simpleminded best pal, Mike Schank and his elderly pessimistic uncle, Bill Borchardt whom together help Mark live out his dreams of becoming a real filmmaker.I have to say that this is by far one of the best and most entertaining documentaries I've ever seen.  It's like capturing lightning in a bottle...something that could never be duplicated.  Even though the documentary essentially started out as a ""Making Of"" feature for Mark's would-be drama 'Northwestern', it eventually morphed into something much bigger and much more important than the movie itself.  'American Movie' is a captivating documentary dealing with friendships, aspirations, financial difficulties, substance abuse, life, death and everything in between.There's never a dull moment in this 107 minute film...Whether it's Mark directing a group of actors dressed head-to-toe in black sheets, telling them  that they need to ""look more menacing""...or his best bud Mike Schank telling the ridiculous story of how he and Mark became such good friends.  The entire movie is filled with strange, quirky characters which you can't help but to sympathize with and root for.  The true unsung heroes in this documentary though are certainly the editors Jun Diaz and Barry Poltermann who do a fantastic job at turning hundreds of hours of raw footage into such a fantastic film.I don't want to give too much away in terms of all the craziness that goes on in 'American Movie' but I strongly recommend everyone go out and buy this DVD.  It's truly one of the funniest and most inspirational films I've seen in many years.4.5 out of 5 StarsHIGHLY RECOMMENDED",5,One of the best documentaries I've ever seen!,1268006400,"03 8, 2010",2010,2880,"[""'American"", 'Movie', 'one', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'sitting', 'local', 'video', 'store', 'shelf', 'past', 'decade', 'never', 'once', 'thought', 'renting', 'simplistic', 'VHS/DVD', 'cover', 'one', 'always', 'sparked', 'curiosity', 'not', 'enough', 'actually', 'pick', 'up', 'flip', 'read', 'synopsis', 'always', 'assumed', 'was', 'sort', 'fake', 'documentary', 'similar', ""'This"", 'Spinal', 'Tap', 'never', 'really', 'gave', 'chance', 'Bored', 'looking', 'something', 'new', 'watch', 'decided', 'finally', 'give', 'one', 'go', 'feel', 'kicking', 'nuts', 'not', 'doing', 'so', 'sooner.The', 'documentary', 'inspired', 'indie', 'filmmaker', 'Mark', 'Borchardt', 'Milwaukee', 'Wisconsin', 'direct', 'first', 'full', 'length', 'feature', 'film', 'titled', ""'Northwestern"", 'Mark', 'early', ""n't"", 'have', 'funds', 'needed', 'complete', 'project', 'forced', 'put', ""'Northwestern"", 'hold', 'order', 'raise', 'money', 'project', 'go', 'back', 'shoot', 'movie', 'first', '40', 'minute', 'horror', 'thriller', 'titled', ""'Coven"", 'started', 'filming', 'several', 'years', 'earlier', 'never', 'finished', 'Mark', 'plan', 'finish', ""'Coven"", 'sell', '3,000', 'VHS', 'copies', '14.95', 'would', 'give', 'enough', 'money', 'make', ""'Northwestern"", 'ride', 'Mark', 'simpleminded', 'best', 'pal', 'Mike', 'Schank', 'elderly', 'pessimistic', 'uncle', 'Bill', 'Borchardt', 'whom', 'together', 'help', 'Mark', 'live', 'out', 'dreams', 'becoming', 'real', 'filmmaker.I', 'have', 'say', 'far', 'one', 'best', 'most', 'entertaining', 'documentaries', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'capturing', 'lightning', 'bottle', 'something', 'could', 'never', 'be', 'duplicated', 'Even', 'documentary', 'essentially', 'started', 'out', 'Making', 'feature', 'Mark', 'would-be', 'drama', ""'Northwestern"", 'eventually', 'morphed', 'something', 'much', 'bigger', 'much', 'more', 'important', 'movie', ""'American"", 'Movie', 'captivating', 'documentary', 'dealing', 'friendships', 'aspirations', 'financial', 'difficulties', 'substance', 'abuse', 'life', 'death', 'everything', 'between.There', 'never', 'dull', 'moment', '107', 'minute', 'film', 'Mark', 'directing', 'group', 'actors', 'dressed', 'head-to-toe', 'black', 'sheets', 'telling', 'need', 'look', 'more', 'menacing', 'best', 'bud', 'Mike', 'Schank', 'telling', 'ridiculous', 'story', 'how', 'Mark', 'became', 'such', 'good', 'friends', 'entire', 'movie', 'filled', 'strange', 'quirky', 'characters', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'sympathize', 'root', 'true', 'unsung', 'heroes', 'documentary', 'though', 'are', 'certainly', 'editors', 'Jun', 'Diaz', 'Barry', 'Poltermann', 'who', 'do', 'fantastic', 'job', 'turning', 'hundreds', 'hours', 'raw', 'footage', 'fantastic', 'film.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'terms', 'craziness', ""'American"", 'Movie', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'everyone', 'go', 'buy', 'DVD', 'truly', 'one', 'funniest', 'most', 'inspirational', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', 'years.4.5', '5', 'StarsHIGHLY', 'RECOMMENDED']",N/A

I wouldn't call the movie &quot;touching&quot; (as some reviewers have). &quot;Touching&quot; is when the hero saves the day and rides off into the sunset, not when the hero guzzles his Miller Lite as he prepares for the 30th take of trying to drive a fellow actor's head through a poorly scored cabinet door (one of the movie's funniest scenes, by the way).For what it's worth, this movie is extremely captivating. Part of you will laugh at his unintended buffoonery, and part of you will want desperately for him to succeed, no matter how absurd or far-fetched his dreams are. It's almost like watching a train wreck, actually. The result will leave you watching with full attention as Mark and his friends do their best at making movie magic.

21714,A2FPDWTD9AENVK,0767839145,Carl Manes,"[1, 1]","AMERICAN MOVIE is one of the most devastating, inspiring, and important films to hit the Documentary scene in decades. It is hilarious at times, depressing and hopeless at others, but regardless of the emotional response, it remains entertaining from start to finish. The filmmakers follow the life of Mark Borchardt as he attempts to complete his life's work in NORTHWESTERN, a Life and Times film based on his personal experiences struggling to make ends meet in lower-Middle Class Wisconsin. With past-due bills mounting up, time slipping by, and financing running short, Mark decides to complete his work on an earlier film COVEN in order to raise funds for his feature film. What starts as a behind the scenes documentary turns into an in depth exploration and character study of several heart-felt and sincere individuals struggling to achieve the American dream. While Mark, his ex-druggie pal Mike, fading Uncle Bill, and disillusioned parents may not be ideal role models, one thing is for certain: they are 100% real depictions of the human condition. Regardless of what new difficulties life brings in each waking moment, Mark adamantly maintains a positive attitude and progresses in a forward motion, somehow beating the odds in the face of endless adversity. One can't help but sympathize with he and each of the other characters, even though it is Mark's own personal vices like unemployment, lack of motivation, and alcoholism that set him back from his ultimate goal. In the end, when COVEN is completed and his life's dream is within grasp, the audience shares in his accomplishment and overwhelming sense of self-satisfaction, an empathetic response that is lacking in so many other soulless cinematic features. Everyone should make an effort to see this film, and it is not an eclectic art house flick reserved for Documentary buffs by any means.

Burch,"[34, 35]","As I watched Mark Borchardt stumble through the filming of 'Coven', I kept thinking of the Austrian court composer Solieri's line in Milos Forman's Amadeus: ""All I ever wanted was to sing to God"", laments Solieri, ""He gave me that longing, and then made me mute"".What do you do with your life when you want to sing, but you are tone deaf? What if you spend far more time dreaming than making your dreams come true? That is the subject of this surprisingly touching and moving documentary.Mark Borchardt is not mute. His muse has whispered in his ear since he was 12 years old, telling him to make movies. Problems with drinking and a stint in the Army have kept him from his love. As the documentary opens, Mark is doing pre-production for a feature-length movie, 'Northwestern'. As you watch Mark meet with production staff and potential actors, you quickly realize that he is hopelessly over his head. Mark is given to long, rambling monologues, where you feel he is trying to throw a net of words over his problems.Eventually Mark sees the handwriting on the wall. He realizes that he cannot start this movie, and decides instead to complete a short film he started several years earlier, 'Coven'. (Mark pronounces it KO-ven, rather than KUH-ven).As the documentary progresses, you are brought into the well intentioned but dysfunctional world of Mark's friends and family. You find yourself wondering about the line between loyalty and co-dependency. What is the difference between supporting a dream and enabling a friend to live in a fantasy world?  You see the inhabitants of Mark's world struggle with these questions. Through it all, Mark may stumble, but he holds true to quest of completing Coven.If Mark is quixotic, then his good friend Mike Shank is definitely his Pancho. Mike has been sober for a couple of years, but you can tell he was dinged up a bit in the drug wars. He is so totally without guile, and so completely loyal to Mark, as to be utterly disarming.It is tempting to smirk at these people at the beginning of the film, much less easy to do so by the end.  Whatever you think of Mark as a filmmaker, you are moved by his struggle to see his vision completed.Chris Smith could have created a patronizing look at an Auteur with less talent than himself, but he has accomplished much more than that. This story makes you wonder about the dreams of people who are not famous, or glamorous, but still listen to their muse. The touching conclusion of this movie is that there is real nobility in their quixotic quest.",4,What if Don Quixote lived in Wisconsin and drank schnapps?,1015632000,"03 9, 2002",2002,2541,"['watched', 'Mark', 'Borchardt', 'stumble', 'filming', ""'Coven"", 'kept', 'thinking', 'Austrian', 'court', 'composer', 'Solieri', 'line', 'Milos', 'Forman', 'Amadeus', 'ever', 'wanted', 'was', 'sing', 'God', 'Solieri', 'gave', 'longing', 'then', 'made', 'mute', 'do', 'do', 'life', 'when', 'want', 'sing', 'are', 'tone', 'deaf', 'What', 'spend', 'far', 'more', 'time', 'dreaming', 'making', 'dreams', 'come', 'true', 'subject', 'surprisingly', 'touching', 'moving', 'documentary.Mark', 'Borchardt', 'not', 'mute', 'muse', 'whispered', 'ear', 'was', '12', 'years', 'old', 'telling', 'make', 'movies', 'Problems', 'drinking', 'stint', 'Army', 'have', 'kept', 'love', 'documentary', 'Mark', 'doing', 'pre-production', 'feature-length', 'movie', 'watch', 'Mark', 'meet', 'production', 'staff', 'potential', 'actors', 'quickly', 'realize', 'hopelessly', 'head', 'Mark', 'given', 'long', 'rambling', 'monologues', 'where', 'feel', 'trying', 'throw', 'net', 'words', 'problems.Eventually', 'Mark', 'handwriting', 'wall', 'can', 'not', 'start', 'movie', 'decides', 'instead', 'complete', 'short', 'film', 'started', 'several', 'years', 'earlier', 'Mark', 'KO-ven', 'rather', 'KUH-ven', 'documentary', 'progresses', 'are', 'brought', 'well', 'intentioned', 'dysfunctional', 'world', 'Mark', 'friends', 'family', 'find', 'wondering', 'line', 'loyalty', 'co-dependency', 'What', 'difference', 'supporting', 'dream', 'enabling', 'friend', 'live', 'fantasy', 'world', 'see', 'inhabitants', 'Mark', 'world', 'struggle', 'questions', 'Mark', 'may', 'stumble', 'true', 'quest', 'completing', 'Coven.If', 'Mark', 'quixotic', 'then', 'good', 'friend', 'Mike', 'Shank', 'definitely', 'Pancho', 'Mike', 'been', 'sober', 'couple', 'years', 'can', 'tell', 'was', 'dinged', 'up', 'bit', 'drug', 'wars', 'so', 'totally', 'guile', 'so', 'completely', 'loyal', 'Mark', 'be', 'utterly', 'disarming.It', 'tempting', 'smirk', 'people', 'beginning', 'film', 'much', 'less', 'easy', 'do', 'so', 'end', 'think', 'Mark', 'filmmaker', 'are', 'moved', 'struggle', 'see', 'vision', 'completed.Chris', 'Smith', 'could', 'have', 'created', 'patronizing', 'look', 'Auteur', 'less', 'talent', 'accomplished', 'much', 'more', 'story', 'wonder', 'dreams', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'famous', 'glamorous', 'still', 'listen', 'muse', 'touching', 'conclusion', 'movie', 'real', 'nobility', 'quixotic', 'quest']",N/A

Tiny Midwestern town, East European mother, making shoestring-budget zombie movies to finance bigger zombie movies, working with his best friend as an actor - all Sam Raimi.  &quot;Northwestern&quot; even seems to bear a thematic resemblance to Raimi's &quot;A Simple Plan&quot;.",4,"Sam Raimi's life, but funny",976665600,"12 13, 2000",2000,864,"['one', 'most', 'genuine', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'much', 'more', 'believable', 'many', 'straight', 'documentaries', 'fun', 'characters', 'so', 'lovingly', 'gently', 'while', 'exposing', 'more', 'stories', 'None', 'characters', 'even', 'throwaways', 'are', 'one-dimensional', 'movie', 'movie', 'film', 'lovers', 'only', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'lose', 'patience', 'movie', 'defy', 'categorization', 'being', 'real', 'lot', 'reviewers', 'was', ""n't"", '100', '%', 'sure', 'while', 'realised', 'how', 'similar', 'story', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'life', 'Tiny', 'Midwestern', 'town', 'East', 'European', 'mother', 'making', 'shoestring-budget', 'zombie', 'movies', 'finance', 'bigger', 'zombie', 'movies', 'working', 'best', 'friend', 'actor', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'quot', 'Northwestern', 'quot', 'even', 'bear', 'thematic', 'resemblance', 'Raimi', 'quot', 'A', 'Simple', 'Plan', 'quot']",N/A

I kept asking him, ""Is this real?  No, really...is it?""The gist of it is this: Mark Borchardt is an aspiring horror filmmaker that spends a little too much time drinking and dreaming.  He even admits it in one of the best lines of the movie, ""...to not just drink and dream, but to create and complete.""Mark is a dreamer, a big one, but that's what makes him so endearing.  He never gives up on his goals, even when he's flat broke and working crappy jobs.  He gets his friends to help him - people that are, for the most part, far from professional actors and filmmakers - and continues on.  He wants - no *needs* - to make it.One of the greatest things about this movie is its purity.  Mark wants to make it for all the right reasons (he truly *loves* horror movies).  He's honest, determined, and an all-around good guy.  There is little about him that is pretentious or shallow.  He's making art for the right reasons, even if it doesn't come out as good as it could.The movie is also hilarious!  There are a TON of great lines in it: Mike Shank saying he used to get ""really pissed off inside"" when he couldn't find someone to drink vodka with, Uncle Bill screaming, ""It's all right, its okay!  There's something to live for - Jesus told me soooo!"", Mark's kid saying, ""Don't bother me, you...you...you FOX!""...I've must have quoted this movie hundreds of times, and watched it just as much!  I mean it - I went through a period where I would watch this movie everyday!  My friends and I even left a message on Mike Shank's answering machine!Lastly, it is directed beautifully: the shots of Mark driving...the junkyard...Mark closing-up the cemetery...

The main character is a projectionist(If that is a word). He projects his dreams and ambitions on to other people.  Then he tries to motivate them by telling them their dreams will come true if they help him but they are his dreams not theirs.  He has motivation at points but a total lack of preparation so he always loses his cool.

The convenience store clerk, the guy emptying the trash cans at the mall, the cemetary grounds keeper... it takes one of these people we barely acknowledge and just sort of feel bad for, and shows us that they can be far more interesting and have grander dreams than any movie character or celebrity.Honest to God, I don't know if this is a real documentary or a fictional &quot;mockumentary&quot;, and looking at other reviews, I don't know if anyone else does. Ultimately it doesn't matter; this is a very touching, very funny, and occasionally very depressing film. What it reminds me of is Wes Anderson's &quot;Bottle Rocket&quot;, in that it's very dry and unassuming, yet still manages to say something very profound about the human condition. If there was any question that the wacky characters in &quot;Bottle Rocket&quot; were so striking because really they were incredibly real, then this movie (if it is indeed a documentary) removes all doubt.In a perfect world, someone as intelligent and creative and determined as our hero Mike would be destined for the success he so desperately wants and deserves, yet the movie draws it's sadness from the fact that we know that the real world just isn't a movie. The movie ends with Mike's premier of &quot;Coven&quot;, so it's hard to say whether or not he's going to make it, but you're certainly left hoping he does.&quot;American Movie&quot; is terribly unique and very hard to pin down. It's not for everyone - I'm not even sure it's for me - but it's such a multi-faceted film, I can't imagine anyone not getting SOMETHING out of it.

It takes hard work, supportive friends and family, borrowed money, headaches, lottery tickets, and a lot of beer.American Movie: The Making of Northwestern is an indie film about indie films.  Director Chris Smith's documentary follows aspiring Milwaukee filmmaker Mark Borchardt as he pursues his life's dream - to produce a feature film called Northwestern.  Unfortunately, this film isn't really about the making of Northwestern - because early in the film, Mark realizes that he doesn't have enough money to produce it.  Instead, he decides to finish his short film, Coven, so he can sell copies (at least 3,000, he calculates) and earn the money to produce his feature film.American Movie is a hilarious look at the life of an independent filmmaker - beginning with the first movies he made as a kid (The More the Scarier 1- 3).  Smith follows Borchardt as he tries to get funding from his reluctant Uncle Bill, talks his mom into doing camera work, bails his friend (and associate producer) out of jail, and drags his kids along (sleeping bags in hand) to the editing studio - always with his laid-back drinking buddy, Mike Schank, at his side.American Movie is surreal.  You'll never believe that it's a true story about real people making a real movie - but it really is.  I promise.If you've ever wondered what it would be like to make a movie, head to the nearest video store and pick up American Movie.

The filmmakers, along with director Chris Smith, produced a well done documentary about a regular guy, a ""man on the street"" who wants to achieve his dream of producing a really good movie and making an honest buck off of it. The cinematography was very well done; and the interviews with filmmaker Mark Borchardt, his mother, his father, his brothers, his girlfriend and buddies are very well done; they are sprinkled in with the rest of the documentary to produce an engaging film that won't leave you bored. The movie is funny, poignant and full of interesting twists to the story as we follow Mark Borchardt's quest to make his dreams come true.When the action starts, we are quickly introduced to Mark Borchardt, a struggling young filmmaker who desperately wants to produce a film called ""Northwestern;"" this is his life long dream. However, Mark soon realizes that he lacks the funds to make the movie; and he turns to finishing the end of a much shorter film he calls ""Coven"" (""Coven"" rhymes with ""woven"").  Mark must also talk others into acting in Coven, not to mention the uphill battle of recruiting disinterested people to be his film crew. It's a tough job; but Mark seems very determined when the film starts and that's a quality I admire very much.We meet a few of the important people in Mark's life along the way. There's Mike Schank, an old buddy of Mark's; and we meet childhood friends, too. There's Mark's mother (Monica Borchardt) who isn't terribly optimistic about Mark in the film industry; and Mark's father (Cliff Borchardt) doesn't seem terribly optimistic, either--but hopes that at least Mark's ""language"" will tone down. (Mark's father is referring to swearing.) We also meet Mark's two brothers. There are two actors of interest in Mark's film entitled ""Coven;"" we meet and get interesting interview footage with actor Robert Richard Jorge and Tom Schimmels. Schimmels laments that Mark's schedule almost always runs late; but he very kindly stays late as much as he can to help Mark finish ""Coven."" I also liked the interview footage with Joan Petrie, Mark's girlfriend.Of course, from here the story in this documentary can go just about anywhere--after all, this is real life! How does Mark handle the tension between him and his former girlfriend with whom he had three kids? Will Mark's brothers eventually help him by acting in ""Coven?"" What about Mark's elderly Uncle Bill Borchardt who rather generously forks over $3,000 to help Mark make ""Coven;"" will he realize a profit on his investment? Will other actors including Tom Schimmels and Miriam Frost have enough patience to remain in the film to its completion or will Mark have to replace them and redo several scenes? Watch and find out!The DVD comes with a number of extras. I liked the seven or eight deleted scenes that we get; and we even get the entire film ""Coven"" as a wonderful extra bonus. Great!Overall, American Movie has great significance as a documentary about an everyday man trying hard honestly to achieve his dreams. I admire him, the others we come to know, and the people who made this film a reality. I highly recommend this film for people who like documentaries; and people who are interested to see the everyday man who is not famous struggle to achieve his dreams would do well to get this DVD.",5,very good documentary with lots of laughs and so much more,1242432000,"05 16, 2009",2009,3420,"['American', 'Movie', 'may', 'sometimes', 'have', 'feel', 'staged', 'mockumentary', 'indeed', 'truly', 'documentary', 'filmmakers', 'director', 'Chris', 'Smith', 'produced', 'well', 'done', 'documentary', 'regular', 'guy', 'man', 'street', 'who', 'achieve', 'dream', 'producing', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'making', 'honest', 'buck', 'cinematography', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'interviews', 'filmmaker', 'Mark', 'Borchardt', 'mother', 'father', 'brothers', 'girlfriend', 'buddies', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'are', 'sprinkled', 'rest', 'documentary', 'produce', 'engaging', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'leave', 'bored', 'movie', 'funny', 'poignant', 'full', 'interesting', 'twists', 'story', 'follow', 'Mark', 'Borchardt', 'quest', 'make', 'dreams', 'come', 'action', 'are', 'quickly', 'introduced', 'Mark', 'Borchardt', 'struggling', 'young', 'filmmaker', 'who', 'desperately', 'produce', 'film', 'called', 'Northwestern', 'life', 'long', 'dream', 'However', 'Mark', 'soon', 'funds', 'make', 'movie', 'finishing', 'end', 'much', 'shorter', 'film', 'Coven', 'Coven', 'woven', 'Mark', 'must', 'also', 'talk', 'others', 'acting', 'Coven', 'not', 'mention', 'uphill', 'battle', 'recruiting', 'disinterested', 'people', 'be', 'film', 'crew', 'tough', 'job', 'Mark', 'very', 'determined', 'when', 'film', 'starts', 'quality', 'admire', 'very', 'much.We', 'meet', 'few', 'important', 'people', 'Mark', 'life', 'way', 'Mike', 'Schank', 'old', 'buddy', 'Mark', 'meet', 'childhood', 'friends', 'too', 'Mark', 'mother', 'Monica', 'Borchardt', 'who', ""n't"", 'terribly', 'optimistic', 'Mark', 'film', 'industry', 'Mark', 'father', 'Cliff', 'Borchardt', ""n't"", 'seem', 'terribly', 'optimistic', 'least', 'Mark', 'language', 'will', 'tone', 'down', 'Mark', 'father', 'referring', 'swearing', 'also', 'meet', 'Mark', 'two', 'brothers', 'are', 'two', 'actors', 'interest', 'Mark', 'film', 'entitled', 'Coven', 'meet', 'get', 'interesting', 'interview', 'footage', 'actor', 'Robert', 'Richard', 'Jorge', 'Tom', 'Schimmels', 'Schimmels', 'Mark', 'schedule', 'almost', 'always', 'runs', 'late', 'very', 'kindly', 'late', 'as', 'much', 'can', 'help', 'Mark', 'finish', 'Coven', 'also', 'liked', 'interview', 'footage', 'Joan', 'Petrie', 'Mark', 'girlfriend.Of', 'course', 'here', 'story', 'documentary', 'can', 'go', 'just', 'about', 'anywhere', 'real', 'life', 'How', 'Mark', 'handle', 'tension', 'former', 'girlfriend', 'whom', 'had', 'three', 'kids', 'Will', 'Mark', 'brothers', 'eventually', 'help', 'acting', 'Coven', 'What', 'Mark', 'elderly', 'Uncle', 'Bill', 'Borchardt', 'who', 'rather', 'generously', '3,000', 'help', 'Mark', 'make', 'Coven', 'will', 'realize', 'profit', 'investment', 'Will', 'other', 'actors', 'including', 'Tom', 'Schimmels', 'Miriam', 'Frost', 'have', 'enough', 'patience', 'remain', 'film', 'completion', 'will', 'Mark', 'have', 'replace', 'redo', 'several', 'scenes', 'Watch', 'find', 'out', 'DVD', 'number', 'extras', 'liked', 'seven', 'eight', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'get', 'even', 'get', 'entire', 'film', 'Coven', 'wonderful', 'extra', 'bonus', 'Great', 'Overall', 'American', 'Movie', 'great', 'significance', 'documentary', 'everyday', 'man', 'trying', 'hard', 'honestly', 'achieve', 'dreams', 'admire', 'others', 'come', 'know', 'people', 'who', 'made', 'film', 'reality', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'people', 'who', 'documentaries', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'see', 'everyday', 'man', 'who', 'not', 'famous', 'struggle', 'achieve', 'dreams', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'get', 'DVD']",N/A

The bad thing is, is that he doesn't really have any money because he works mainly part time lame jobs. While trying to make his new movie `Northwestern', he realizes he doesn't have the money for it, nor is anything really ready for it. So he goes back to making a 30+ minute movie, called `Coven',  he stopped filming awhile back to hopefully make some money off it to help pay for `Northwestern'. With the help of his best friend Mike Schank, they start to call local actors to get `Coven' done.I never even heard of this until an Amazon friend named D. Wilson reviewed this awhile back. I'm glad he did though because this documentary is, in my opinion, absolutely hilarious. Not everything, but so much. I was in awe when watching Mark in action. The man really does try his best. I mean when he's at his best, he's still almost laughable. And I don't mean that in a bad way, but sometimes he is. So many times I feel bad for him also, because the people around him are just, well, not good at all. And you can see the frustration in his face sometimes because of it. You can tell Mark just wants to scream, but yet, the people who are making him want to scream are his family and friend, so he just holds it in. And his best friend Mike, you just can't help but smile every time that guy talks. But man is he fried from his past use of drugs and alcohol.I really hope Mark got his dream, because I haven't even checked. I think he really deserves it though. He's pretty out there, but hell, everyone is different. At least he's a nice guy. It was pretty sad to see him sleeping in a sleeping bag with his 3 children.

21750,A27PSZX2SE0B51,0767839145,Mike Stone,"[8, 15]","Mark Borchardt is a terrible filmmaker.  He has no ear for dialogue, no idea how to tell a story, and can't frame a shot to save his life.  When he gets in front of the camera, his acting is over-the-top, unreal, and uncomfortable to watch (not to mention unnecessarily profanity-laden).  Besides a lack of talent, he's bereft of funds, equipment, and luck.  The people he knows who have volunteered to be in his films are blessed with even less talent than he is.  He'll never be a successful filmmaker, and should quit now while he's not-too-far behindBorchardt does have three things going for him, however.  One is an unending supply of passion, which, without reasonable talent to back up, is useless.  The second is an unstoppably low-key charismatic presence.  And the third is a motormouth to end all motormouths.  The first thing will only get him into the trouble, but the second and third make him entertaining to watch.  Hey!  Instead of making his own painfully bad movies, maybe a documentary team could follow him around for a year, and make that into a movie!Ah, but you've seen through my little ruse, haven't you?  For Chris Smith already had this last idea.  The result of which is an entertaining little gem called ""American Movie"".Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin is a town whose geographic landscape is composed of junkyards, forests, cemeteries, and it would appear not much else.  Those looking for a good time would be best served by picking up a case of beer and turning on the Packers game.  It is from this Midwest mecca for drunkenness and poverty that Mark Borchardt's American Dream grew.  Armed with a passion for filmmaking and a desire to tell the story of his community, he writes a script for a movie to be called ""Northwestern"".  But first, lacking funds, he decides to indulge his George Romero and Tobe Hooper fantasies by producing a cheapie direct-to-video splatterfest called ""Coven"".  ""Coven"" will be his ""Glen or Glenda"", while ""Northwestern"" is his ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"".You root for Mark's success, because he's basically a good guy, with some extreme dreams, trying his darndest to make good.  He buys into the American Dream with all his being, and that kind of passion can't be ignored.  His darker colours, and believe me he has enough to go around, are only peripherally alluded to.  A nasty break up with his first wife is portrayed in a long shot as the two of them bicker beside Mark's car.  His three kids, who get a series of deliriously ignorant interview segments (from their manic twitching and bustling energy you get a good picture of what Mark must have been like at their age), are made to sleep on the floor for several nights in an editing bay, while Mark works furiously to get his film done on time (to his credit, Mark talks to his kids as the intelligent human beings they are, never in a condescending manner).  And his family, consisting of a pragmatic father, a frustrating Swedish mother, and a couple of naysaying brothers, appear all but fed up with his antics, but still try their best to be supportive.  However Mark is probably his own worst enemy, his predilection for alcohol ruining whatever thrust and energy he may have left.One of the most curious planets orbiting in Borchardt's galaxy is Mike Schank.  Armed with an unruly mullet, ever-changing facial hair, and a little boy's voice weakened from years of drinking and drug abuse, Schank would seem an odd choice for the role of Mark's best friend.  But as the saying goes, opposites attract, and Schank fits in beautifully.  His beatific smile is enough to brighten Borchardt up after a depressing day, and his innocent recollections of partying days gone by will do the same for the audience.  After a particularly grueling film shoot, where Schank was called on to bash an old car to smithereens with a baseball bat, he has this conversation with Borchardt:""Was that cathartic for you?"" asks Mark.""Yeah.""""Do you know what cathartic means?""""No.""""It means... um... it means getting it out of your system.""""Yeah.  That was cathartic.  That was real cathartic.""These two modern day Abbot and Costellos are a delight to watch, not just for the unintentional comedy of their moments together, but for the friendship and caring that they obviously share.  And Schank, a man-child seemingly ill-suited for this world, also happens to be a gifted guitar player, ably crossing over genres as diverse as classical and metal.  He is credited with ""American Movie""s original music, a blend of melancholic melodies and power chord riffing, all played on his trusty acoustic guitar.Most depressing here are the scenes with Mark's Uncle Bill.  Bill, who at once time was a ""scholar... with all the answers"", now is a man far from a sound mind in a painfully gaunt old body, living in a junk-strewn trailer park while $280,000 rots unused in the bank.  It takes all of Mark's gusto and wile (and a promised Executive Producer credit) to secure a $3,000 investment from Uncle Bill.  The fact that he does, given Bill's apparent apathy and distrust in Mark's abilities as a filmmaker, is one of the film's grandest miracles.  And it is Bill's rambling, incoherent soliloquy on the American Dream that provides the film's most touching moment.Smith does a great job of slipping in and out of Borchardt's life, capturing the key moments on his road to cinematic infamy.  He conducts several one-on-one interviews with Mark, providing subtle prompting for the riotous answers he knows Mark will give, but never intruding on the reality that is his life.  How he found this guy, and his remarkable circle of friends, I'll never know.  But just for the opportunity to get to know Mark, and feel his infectious passion, I'll always be glad he did.",5,The Rise And Menomonee Falls Of Mark Borchardt,1029110400,"08 12,

21754,A18SDN3HYFVH2L,0767839145,Muzzlehatch,"[2, 2]","AMERICAN MOVIE starts off with a shot of its principle subject, Mark Borchardt, driving on I94, northbound I think. Right away it brings me home and in some respects I'll have a hard time treating this film objectively. Mark and his family and friends hail from southeastern Wisconsin, the Milwaukee suburbs, as does much of my family, and I grew up with and have known people like them all of my life. So excuse me if my review is a little more subjective and biased than usual.Mark B is a very tall, 30ish working-class guy from Menomenee Falls WI (I think; that's the suburb most referred-to) a town on the outer ring of Milwaukee suburbs. Mark has been trying for years to raise money - and talent - for a full-length low budget horror film production called ""Northwestern"" but as the film opens in 1995 he's having a hard time getting it together. Part of the problem is that nobody else seems to share Mark's passion - he has a habit of talking in technical film jargon to people who have no comprehension of it, or for that matter of a lot of simpler concepts. Not having money or any kind of film education, Mark is surrounded by amateurs who are mostly family and friends, notably total burnout Mike Schank (who provided the beautiful, low-key accoustic guitar music for the film) and his uncle Bill, who is physically weak, terminally depressed, and possibly senile. Much of Mark's time is spent trying to cadge money out of Uncle Bill, who doesn't understand or care about Mark's project. Early on he realizes that the feature project just isn't going to happen soon, so he decides to finish off a short film he has been sitting on, Coven, and to put his hopes on video sales of this work getting him enough money to get going on ""Northwestern.""Most of the rest of the film alternates between Mark filming, editing, and post-dubbing Coven, with many scenes being both funny and rather sad or pathetic - like his attempts to have his uncle Joe, the ""executive producer"" recite a very simple line - and his generally despondent personal life, including jobs as a paper deliveryman and a groundskeeper/janitor at a cemetery, the same cemetery (I think) that provides him with fond memories of childhood escapes from his ever-fighting parents. It's not a life of ""quiet desperation"", but rather one of loud, profane and sometimes almost spastic desperation.  And Mark is always full of the kind of great lines that could never be made up for a film; when talking about his beliefs for example he says at one point ""I'm half and half man, half with the Satanist idea and half with the Christian idea.""  It comes out so naturally and yet is...so hilarious.For me this was, as I said, familiar territory; I have a cousin very much like Mark in many respects and I've been around would-be low-budget horror filmmakers quite a bit. The feel of the hopeless rut that Mark feels he's in, both physically (suburban Milwaukee ain't exactly exciting) and mentally (he drinks way too much and has problems with his ex-girlfriend and seeing his 3 kids) are really conveyed well, and yet there's an overriding optimism that always seems to carry him through. A lot of people have commented on his obnoxious, overbearing attitude, and it certainly isn't something that appeals to me - I'd probably hate the guy if I knew him in real life, at least if he kept making condescending statements to me about life and dreams like he does to his family - but somehow it's endearing when you're not right there and you're just seeing how he - somehow - manages to get his project through to completion, over two more years. Much of it is really funny - I couldn't help but find his buddy Mike funny despite his completely wasted, burnt-out life, and Mike too is good-natured about things. It's in a lot of ways a very hopeful and invigorating film about taking chances, and as somebody much like Mark (only older, even) who has frittered away a lot of my life, I can only take heart.One odd element to the whole thing that I haven't seen anybody mention is the interplay between the filmmakers of AMERICAN MOVIE - themselves working on a very low budget and scrabbling around a bit - and Mark and his family and crew. It's an odd choice that there's never really any back-and-forth between them about the nature of the film-about-the-film, we don't know for example where Chris Smith and his crew are staying while they do this, how they're managing with their budget, etc. Not really a fault, but an interesting artistic choice to leave all of that out. What does Mark think about his life being filmed, for that matter? We don't get much of that either.Also on this nicely produced DVD is COVEN, the actual short film that is the subject of the doc; like AMERICAN MOVIE I had seen this years ago, probably in a different cut, when or just after the documentary premiered in Chicago in 1999. I'd almost completely forgotten it, not because it's terrible or anything, but because it's so mediocre. It's obviously heartfelt, and it's really not a horror film despite the marketing - or if it is, it's more of a psychological horror film, with only a little bit of real violence at the end. Mark plays...Mark, a drug addict and alcoholic who wants to turn his life around, and gets involved in a 12-step type group that is obviously Christian in some ways (crosses all over) but also seems to be a cult. Or is it? Is Mark hallucinating the strange things that happen to him at the group meetings, and the ""coven"" (rhymes with ""woven"" of course) that at one point drags him through the mud in the woods, at another surrounds his car and beats on it with pipes. There's some interesting material here about addiction and delusion, but it's generally poorly acted and the lighting in the indoor scenes is such that things are often very indistinct, dark and ugly. Some of the outdoor sequences, the landscapes in particular, are rather beautiful.

Touching, in the sense that viewers are treated to the human side of Mark as he's a father of three trying to make things work. His parents, friends, and family all give interviews about Mark as a person and as a filmmaker. Tragic in the sense that, some of the interviews ridicule Mark, particularly one of his brothers. It's depressing, it's bleak, and it's truthful as Mark is determined to finish his movie. It's a portrayal of American life with one guy doing what he does best: making films. The DVD is particularly delightful offering a bevy of deleted scenes, a commentary with the director, producer, Mark, and best friend Mike Schank.

First, Chris Smith and company have done another excellent job of capturing something uniquely American. The scenes document how Mark Borchardt and friends, although fraught with every obstacle imaginable, still manage to achieve their goal. The movie is well made and develops the character of Mark, Mike and the others at exactly the right pace to keep you interested.But the best thing about the movie is definitely the content.  You can't make up anything this funny. From a bothced violent scene where an actor's head is pummelled over and over to a drunken Thanksgiving party at Mark's uncle Bill's to picking up their friend and fellow movie producer, Ken, at the local jail - everything in this movie is just extraordinary. At some parts, I laughed so hard I almost when into cardiac arrest. At others, I was tremendously touched, especially by the amount of loyalty that these friends had despite their eccentricities and character flaws.Seeing this definitely inspired me to buy &quot;Coven&quot; and I'll probably buy anything else that Borchardt produces, just to see what his out-of-control creativity has come up with next.

Many of Mark's dragons are certainly self-imposed by virtue of poor decisions made in his past, but his enthusiasm for life and film making is inspiring.

21762,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,0767839145,Robert I. Hedges,"[2, 2]","""American Movie"" is a brilliant documentary by Chris Smith and Sarah Price following angst-ridden dreamer Mark Borchardt around Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin as he makes unique movies. The film starts as Mark tries to produce his masterwork, ""Northwestern."" As it becomes clear that ""Northwestern"" is underfunded, Mark decides to finish his horror short ""Coven"" instead. Despite his problems with alcohol and some monotonously inappropriate language use (his Dad even prods him to ""watch the language,"") it is impossible not to get caught up in Mark's life, sympathize with him, and want him to realize his dreams. I found it inspirational that someone in Borchardt's shoes was so chronically upbeat about the American dream and his ultimate success despite being hopelessly mired in debt, doing a paper route in the mornings, and working as a cleaner in a cemetery at night (""Years of vacuuming in a cemetery?...Unh-uh."") The film explores all the emotions that go into making an independent movie, and I was delighted when Mark and his friends finally got to have the premier of ""Coven"" in a local theater.While I liked Mark and sympathized with his longing for greatness, by far my favorite person in the film is Mike Schank. Mike and Mark were friends from a young age, and both used to drink together. Mark still drinks to his detriment in the documentary: the scene of him drunk in his parent's kitchen after the Packers won the Super Bowl was brilliantly captured but extremely uncomfortable. Mike, on the other hand, took to much stronger drugs which nearly killed him, and he now is completely sober and drug free. Mike turned to his music as solace, and the film makes it clear what a wise decision that was; he even wrote and performed the soundtrack for ""Coven."" I really admired Mike for standing up for himself and quietly refusing to return to his previously destructive ways. Everyone can learn from Mike.The film is very good at character contrasts, and no contrast is greater than that between Mike and Mark's Uncle Bill. Bill is a sickly old man (he died shortly after the film was made) who helps finance ""Coven."" Much of the film takes place in Bill's mobile home, and despite his obvious financial interest in his relationship with Bill, it's clear that Mark genuinely loves and cares about his welfare. While many of the scenes with Bill are funny (especially when Bill attempts to record the dialogue for the film's opening line,) most are melancholy, as it's clear that Bill increasingly doesn't find living worth the effort. One scene that was tastefully shot yet searingly poignant was when Mark bathed his drunken uncle and dealt with his overgrown toenails. Subtle inclusion of scenes like this really makes Mark a wonderful protagonist despite his faults, and Smith and Price handled these situations perfectly.I watched this documentary with rapt attention, and was handsomely rewarded for it. But when the movie's over, this DVD has extras you will actually want to see. The deleted scenes are uniformly excellent (especially the pieces with Mike Schank,) and there are relevant trailers as well, which are also worth watching. There is a thoughtful and interesting commentary track by Smith, Price, Borchardt, and Schank. It's clear that over the two year production of ""American Movie"" the documentary makers came to appreciate and become genuine friends with their subjects and vice versa. You might think that would introduce some awkward editorial bias into the film, but it doesn't. If anything their mutual respect and admiration makes for a stronger film, as not everything in the film is flattering toward Borchardt. I don't think a team he didn't like or trust as much would be capable of getting such an emotional spectrum into the final product.Finally, a copy of ""Coven,"" Mark's 35 minute horror short, is included. Regardless of whether or not you like the horror genre, seeing ""Coven"" will make you appreciate Mark's world more than would otherwise be possible. Certainly ""Coven"" isn't the best movie I've ever seen, but it's far from the worst either, and it's actually rather amazing considering what Borchardt had to work with. It's true that the acting is amateurish and there are peculiar plot elements that don't quite make sense, but it's also impossible not to appreciate things like Mark's beautifully framed and photographed establishing shots as well.Thanks Chris Smith and Sarah Price for sticking with this project: it is truly a work of documentary brilliance. Thanks also to Jim McKay and Michael Stipe who had the foresight to produce this exceptional film. But the biggest thanks of all goes to Mark Borchardt and Mike Schank: thanks for letting these filmmakers give us a glimpse of the toil and triumph of seeing your film brought to life. All of us who love independent cinema salute you and wish you great success in the future.",5,"""We're Going To Maintain An Echelon Of Professionality!""",1301097600,"03 26,

The uncle being rousted and hustled repeatedly to fund the productions and his nasal monotone W.S. Burroughs-like voice pleading just to be left alone is priceless. Ultimately, it is quite stunning how well the maker of this film captured his subject.

21772,AXR6S03DUXYCN,0767839145,"TK Malone ""tkmalone""","[8, 8]","American MovieReviewed by Bruce Cantwell (a-movie-to-see.com)Mark  Borchardt wants to be a filmmaker, to tell the story of what it means to  grow up a poor working (or unemployed) stiff on the Northwest side of  Milwaukee. He speaks passionately about hanging out with his friends who  drink too much, trying to deaden the nagging thoughts of a bleak future.  His film Northwestern will show this bleakness to reveal a glimpse of the  human goodness that shines through even the toughest circumstances.But  to make his masterpiece, he first needs to sell 3000 copies of a  direct-to-video black &amp; white horror movie short entitled Coven. And  before he can finish making Coven he has to pry $3000 out of his crotchety,  cynical, trailer-living Uncle Bill who's tighter than his Poli Grip  seal.Chris Smith's documentary about &quot;the making of&quot; a low  budget schlock horror movie is the kind of screwball comedy that Hollywood  wishes it could make. Steve Martin tried earlier this summer: Bowfinger  (which wasn't bad), just nowhere near as good.Mark Borchardt, a  cheesehead scarecrow with a look right out of the early seventies isn't  your typical leading man, but he's a hell of a lot more interesting than a  Brad Pitt or Keanu Reeves.Smith captures the dynamics of Mark's complex  relationship with Coven's 82-year old executive producer Uncle Bill.Coven's score composer, Mike Schank, Mark's former drinking buddy (now  sober) explains his involvement in this convoluted enterprise. He likes  Mark and because Mark makes movies, he ends up making movies too. Mike's  first love is the Wisconsin lottery.Other friends, family and cast  members find themselves putting up with Mark's insane, unfocused ambition  not because they have any thought of personal gain but because they know it  means the world to him.His brothers admit that he has a gift for gab if  nothing else. His actors add that he's persistent (Coven takes three years  to complete, Northwestern has been in pre-production since the '80s). No  one but Mark thinks that he'll be a success.Smith records the film  making mishaps with a sense of timing out of This is Spinal Tap but anyone  whose been involved with coordinating the logistics of even a class project  video will vouch for their veracity.Strictly speaking, American Movie is  a tragedy because its protagonist doesn't (and probably never will) make  the movie of his dreams. On the other hand, his film about the underlying  humanity of Northwest Milwaukee's set-upon residents has already been made.  This is it: all the friendship and love and support a man could ask for are  demonstrated in this film. On that score, Mark's a lucky man.If you like  this, try:The Big Picture Christopher Guest's (This is Spinal Tap)  hilarious take on the Independent film scene.Living in Oblivion Steve  Buscemi (Fargo) plays a Borchardt-esque director.20 Dates another  &quot;documentary&quot; about an ambitious film maker.",5,He Wants to Make Films in the Worst Way!,961286400,"06 18, 2000",2000,2961,"['American', 'MovieReviewed', 'Bruce', 'Cantwell', 'a-movie-to-see.com', 'Mark', 'Borchardt', 'be', 'filmmaker', 'tell', 'story', 'what', 'grow', 'up', 'poor', 'working', 'unemployed', 'stiff', 'Northwest', 'side', 'Milwaukee', 'passionately', 'hanging', 'out', 'friends', 'who', 'drink', 'too', 'much', 'trying', 'deaden', 'nagging', 'thoughts', 'bleak', 'future', 'film', 'Northwestern', 'will', 'show', 'bleakness', 'reveal', 'glimpse', 'human', 'goodness', 'even', 'toughest', 'circumstances.But', 'make', 'masterpiece', 'first', 'sell', '3000', 'copies', 'direct-to-video', 'black', 'amp', 'white', 'horror', 'movie', 'short', 'entitled', 'Coven', 'can', 'finish', 'making', 'Coven', 'pry', '3000', 'crotchety', 'cynical', 'trailer-living', 'Uncle', 'Bill', 'who', 'tighter', 'Poli', 'Grip', 'seal.Chris', 'Smith', 'documentary', 'quot', 'making', 'quot', 'low', 'budget', 'schlock', 'horror', 'movie', 'kind', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'Hollywood', 'wishes', 'could', 'make', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'tried', 'earlier', 'summer', 'Bowfinger', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'just', 'nowhere', 'near', 'good.Mark', 'Borchardt', 'cheesehead', 'scarecrow', 'look', 'right', 'early', 'seventies', ""n't"", 'typical', 'leading', 'man', 'hell', 'lot', 'more', 'interesting', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Keanu', 'Reeves.Smith', 'dynamics', 'Mark', 'complex', 'relationship', 'Coven', '82-year', 'old', 'executive', 'producer', 'Uncle', 'Bill.Coven', 'score', 'composer', 'Mike', 'Schank', 'Mark', 'former', 'drinking', 'buddy', 'now', 'sober', 'involvement', 'convoluted', 'enterprise', 'Mark', 'Mark', 'movies', 'up', 'making', 'movies', 'too', 'Mike', 'first', 'love', 'Wisconsin', 'lottery.Other', 'friends', 'family', 'cast', 'members', 'find', 'putting', 'up', 'Mark', 'insane', 'unfocused', 'ambition', 'not', 'have', 'thought', 'personal', 'gain', 'know', 'world', 'him.His', 'brothers', 'admit', 'gift', 'gab', 'nothing', 'else', 'actors', 'add', 'persistent', 'Coven', 'three', 'years', 'complete', 'Northwestern', 'been', 'pre-production', ""'80s"", 'No', 'one', 'Mark', ""'ll"", 'be', 'success.Smith', 'film', 'making', 'mishaps', 'sense', 'timing', 'Spinal', 'Tap', 'anyone', 'been', 'involved', 'coordinating', 'logistics', 'even', 'class', 'project', 'video', 'will', 'vouch', 'veracity.Strictly', 'speaking', 'American', 'Movie', 'tragedy', 'protagonist', ""n't"", 'probably', 'never', 'will', 'make', 'movie', 'dreams', 'other', 'hand', 'film', 'underlying', 'humanity', 'Northwest', 'Milwaukee', 'set-upon', 'residents', 'already', 'been', 'made', 'friendship', 'love', 'support', 'man', 'could', 'ask', 'are', 'demonstrated', 'film', 'score', 'Mark', 'lucky', 'man.If', 'try', 'Big', 'Picture', 'Christopher', 'Guest', 'Spinal', 'Tap', 'hilarious', 'take', 'Independent', 'film', 'scene.Living', 'Oblivion', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'Fargo', 'Borchardt-esque', 'director.20', 'Dates', 'quot', 'documentary', 'quot', 'ambitious', 'film', 'maker']",N/A

21774,A29TQOG3Y48T8L,0767839145,Trevor Jones,"[3, 4]","American Movie is an absolutely enjoyable and strangely fascinating documentary by the filmmaking team of director CHRIS SMITH and producer SARAH PRICE. It's a story about following your dream. The subject of the film is a young, fiercely dedicated, self-defined filmmaker Mark Borchardt. Borchardt, who was born and lives in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin and who has, since the age of 14, been trying to fulfill his dream of becoming a successful Hollywood feature film director . . . in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, is one of the most genuine and interesting documentary subjects you could imagine. &quot;But I've never heard of him,&quot; you say. I know. He's not yet famous but he's still fascinating. In this delightful and thoroughly honest film, you'll see how this young man, now 30-something, continues to pursue his &quot;impossible dream&quot; despite his parents' wishes that he get a job in a factory, his lack of any serious financial backing, and many years of dreaming and drinking when, as he says himself, he should've been working on his films.In this very intimate film you'll see some of his work and follow very closely as he pursues capital investment ($3,000) from his very tight-fisted and colorful uncle, enlists his mother to be an extra as she explains that she really needs to go shopping instead, and shoots and edits his film with the constant and loyal support of his long-time friend, Mike Schank. Mike has been his friend since childhood. He's a musician, a guitarist, and admitted drug abuser (though he's been clean for the last four years.) He's a kind of real-life &quot;Reverend Jim&quot; from TV's Taxi. He has definitely been affected by all the various drugs and alcohol he's drunk, sniffed, swallowed, and whatever over the years. But he's a kind and loyal friend--someone we can't help but like.The characters are very interesting and well worth watching. I found this non-fictional documentary more interesting to watch than many fictional films I've sat through. CHRIS SMITH has captured his subject with affection, respect, and honesty.

21775,AEBZVNKHJNJHU,0767839145,"T. SIMPSON ""amazon man""","[2, 3]","This is a splendid documentary.  Don't be put off by the fact that it's not a real movie.  It has the right elements itself to make great entertainment.It's about a guy named Mark in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, who has had the bug to make films since he was a teenager.  He had set out before to accomplish this goal, but never quite got anything substatial to completion.  So he enlists his friends and family in helping out with the production or by loans.  He gets volunteers from the neighborhood to help on on production and he tests and hires local actors to play the parts.The cast of characters here is what makes this so entertaining.  He goes out to his crotchety old uncle Bill's trailer home and badgers him into loaning him $3000, telling him he'll make him executive producer.  His best friend Mike is like his assistant director and soundtrack musician, but can hardly put cognitive sentences together because of prior alcohol and drug abuse.  Another assistant had to be picked up from jail.  One of the actors is a flamboyant, prissy older man, and one has to wonder what his life is like in Wisconsin.His family humors him and they act like this is just another hair-brained idea of his that he takes to the extreme.  His determination and passion for creating a movie are admirable.  You end up rooting for him, against all odds.  He's like the Packers.  They're out there on the gridiron in the ice and snow, fighting with all they've got.  Only he's doing it behind the camera and in the cutting room.There are many laugh-out-loud moments in this.  Most are unintentional and the result of everyone acting like they've got half a brain.  It could be scary, if one thought about it.  Imagine riding in the backseat of an old beater with your old bone-headed friends you've known since you were kids, all piled in, jostlying for more room, and you have a camera and your taping all of the lunacy.  Well that's the feeling you get while watching this; you're just one of the guys, hanging around, rooting for the Packers.This is an inspiring movie, has moments of melancholy and hilarity, and ends with a touching moment.  You can't help but be proud of their effort.

There were documentaries which spawned the popular mockumentaries, fictional movies filmed like a documentary. AMERICAN MOVIE is a strange hybrid of the two: it is a documentary that feels like a mockumentary. The film revolves around Mark Borchardt, a thirty-year-old man who has been making cheap 8 MM films since childhood. The film revolves around a 2-plus year journey to finish his horror masterpiece, COVEN (pronounced like woven). Connected through this story are several interesting people: such as Mark's best friend Mike Schank (a former drug addict), Mark's Uncle Bill (who has a fortune of around $250,000 and literally whithers away as the movie progresses), and Mark's Mom (a fiesty, yet supportive woman).  Mark wants to finish COVEN so that he can finish his true film opus, a semi-autobiographical movie called NORTHWESTERN. Along the way, there are tons of challenges from the mundane (trying to pay off his phone bill) to the unusual (slicing together a missing frame in his movie hours before its public premiere).The film is both funny and heartwarming. I found it funny because real life is often funny and many of the people in AMERICAN MOVIE reminded me of people in my own life I have known and met.  It's heartwarming because despite all that Mark goes through (huge amounts of debt, custody battles, etc.) he still keeps plodding away until his movie gets finished.
