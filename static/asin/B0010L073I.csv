1125672,AY12DBB0U420B,B0010L073I,Gary Peterson,"[0, 0]","I was shopping for movies on the bargain rack of a nearby Ross Store and found the ""Rush Hour 3 Pack."" I was reluctant to buy it at first because I'd never heard of the movies and I'd never watched a marshal arts film. Oh well, it would be something new. I really enjoyed the original ""Rush Hour."" It was a lot of fast action in Los Angeles and was rather funny in a strange and different way. I was chuckling off and on throughout the whole movie and I wondered how they ever managed to make such movies. The story didn't amount to much, I might add, but it was an enjoyable movie. I could say the same thing for ""Rush Hour 2,"" except the location was Hong Kong. Again, the story was ho-hum but it was a fun movie to watch. Not as fun as the original Rush Hour, I might add. ""Rush Hour 3"" took place in Paris and most of it was centered around the Eiffel Tower. I just didn't particularly care for it. By that time, I was burned out on the Rush Hour way of doing things. It became tiresome and I  was just eager for it to end. As a three pack, it's a good deal, if you like this type of movie. I'm going to rate it four stars, but be aware that I think Rush Hour 3 was only 2 stars. The three movies of very much the same thing just became a bit tiresome. I rated each of the individual movies separately under their own titles, if you're interested. I gave 4 stars to the first two.Gary Peterson",4,"Two Strong Movies, One Weak.",1336176000,"05 5, 2012",2012,1397,"['was', 'shopping', 'movies', 'bargain', 'rack', 'nearby', 'Ross', 'Store', 'found', 'Rush', 'Hour', '3', 'Pack', 'was', 'reluctant', 'buy', 'first', ""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'movies', ""'d"", 'never', 'watched', 'marshal', 'film', 'Oh', 'well', 'would', 'be', 'something', 'new', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'original', 'Rush', 'Hour', 'was', 'lot', 'fast', 'action', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'was', 'rather', 'funny', 'strange', 'different', 'way', 'was', 'chuckling', 'off', 'whole', 'movie', 'wondered', 'how', 'ever', 'managed', 'make', 'such', 'movies', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'amount', 'much', 'might', 'add', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'could', 'say', 'same', 'thing', 'Rush', 'Hour', '2', 'location', 'was', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'Again', 'story', 'was', 'ho-hum', 'was', 'fun', 'movie', 'watch', 'Not', 'as', 'fun', 'original', 'Rush', 'Hour', 'might', 'add', 'Rush', '3', 'took', 'place', 'Paris', 'most', 'was', 'centered', 'Eiffel', 'Tower', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'care', 'time', 'was', 'burned', 'out', 'Rush', 'Hour', 'way', 'doing', 'things', 'became', 'tiresome', 'was', 'just', 'eager', 'end', 'three', 'pack', 'good', 'deal', 'like', 'type', 'movie', ""'m"", 'going', 'rate', 'four', 'stars', 'be', 'aware', 'think', 'Rush', 'Hour', '3', 'was', 'only', '2', 'stars', 'three', 'movies', 'very', 'much', 'same', 'thing', 'just', 'became', 'bit', 'tiresome', 'rated', 'individual', 'movies', 'separately', 'own', 'titles', ""'re"", 'interested', 'gave', '4', 'stars', 'first', 'two.Gary', 'Peterson']",Rush Hour 1-3:SE Giftset (DVD)
