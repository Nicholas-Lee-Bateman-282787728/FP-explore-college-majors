512600,A3EBHHCZO6V2A4,B0000203Y5,"Amaranth ""music fan""","[2, 2]","Wim Wenders' ""Buena Vista Social Club"" is a masterpiece. American blues guitarist Ry Cooder goes to Cuba,in search of the legendary Buena Vista Social Club. He comes to an impoverished, aging country. The clubs are long gone, living only in memories. Miraculously, Cooder finds living remnants of Cuba's musical scene-Ibrahim Ferrer, Ruben Gonzales, Compay Segundo, and the singer Omara Portuoundo. Their music is bittersweet. They sing of joys long vanished, of a freer time. Ry Cooder doesn't glamorize Cuba's squalor,nor the repression that drove its musicians underground.""Buena Vista Social Club"" shows musicians who are young at heart. Quite a few have since passed away since this film's release nearly a decade ago. The opening,the haunting ""Chan Chan"",sends chills down the spine. ""Veinte Anos"" is an amazing ballad of unrequited love (when I saw this movie in college,I sang along-it's that powerful) The conclusion is powerful when the musicians come to the US and perform at Carnegie Hall. Ironically, and sadly,the ""Buena Vista Social Club"" was barred from entry to the US after 9/11 since they were branded as ""propagandists"" for the Castro regime. Anyone who has heard their music knows that they sing about love and loss, joy and sorrow... not politics. They are musicians whose golden years are truly golden.""Buena Vista Social Club"" is a soothing bittersweet symphony for the eyes and the soul. It's impossible to watch this documentary without being moved. It's music that speaks to the heart. The musicians are elderly,their song is timeless.",5,Bittersweet Symphony,1212278400,"06 1, 2008",2008,1562,"['Wim', 'Wenders', 'Buena', 'Vista', 'Social', 'Club', 'masterpiece', 'American', 'blues', 'guitarist', 'Ry', 'Cooder', 'Cuba', 'search', 'legendary', 'Buena', 'Vista', 'Social', 'Club', 'impoverished', 'aging', 'country', 'clubs', 'are', 'long', 'gone', 'living', 'only', 'memories', 'Miraculously', 'Cooder', 'living', 'remnants', 'Cuba', 'musical', 'scene-Ibrahim', 'Ferrer', 'Ruben', 'Gonzales', 'Compay', 'Segundo', 'singer', 'Omara', 'Portuoundo', 'music', 'bittersweet', 'sing', 'joys', 'long', 'vanished', 'freer', 'time', 'Ry', 'Cooder', ""n't"", 'glamorize', 'Cuba', 'squalor', 'repression', 'drove', 'musicians', 'underground', 'Buena', 'Vista', 'Social', 'Club', 'shows', 'musicians', 'who', 'are', 'young', 'heart', 'few', 'have', 'passed', 'away', 'film', 'release', 'nearly', 'decade', 'ago', 'opening', 'haunting', 'Chan', 'Chan', 'chills', 'down', 'spine', 'Veinte', 'Anos', 'amazing', 'ballad', 'unrequited', 'love', 'when', 'saw', 'movie', 'college', 'sang', 'along-it', 'powerful', 'conclusion', 'powerful', 'when', 'musicians', 'come', 'US', 'perform', 'Carnegie', 'Hall', 'Ironically', 'sadly', 'Buena', 'Vista', 'Social', 'Club', 'was', 'barred', 'entry', 'US', '9/11', 'were', 'branded', 'propagandists', 'Castro', 'regime', 'Anyone', 'who', 'heard', 'music', 'sing', 'love', 'loss', 'joy', 'sorrow', 'not', 'politics', 'are', 'musicians', 'golden', 'years', 'are', 'truly', 'golden', 'Buena', 'Vista', 'Social', 'Club', 'soothing', 'bittersweet', 'symphony', 'eyes', 'soul', 'impossible', 'watch', 'documentary', 'being', 'moved', 'music', 'heart', 'musicians', 'are', 'elderly', 'song', 'timeless']",Buena Vista Social Club VHS

A documentary on forgotten Cuban musicians? A travelogue of Havana locales?

Maybe it was meant as an introduction to the music, so that if you liked it, you could seek it out on your own. Either way, it's really unfortunate that there isn't a single complete song anywhere in the movie, and sequences like the one with Ry Cooder and his son riding through Havana on a motorcycle cannot serve any purpose.Another bone to pick--most DVDs these days come with hours upon hours of extras, usually useless crap scraped off the editing room floor. One would think, then, that the producers of this DVD would try to fill in the gaps and put in the complete concert and studio performances that were captured.

And please, take my word for granted, this movie deserves it. And more. Forget Martin Scorsese's THE LAST WALTZ and visit THE BUENA VISTA SOCIAL CLUB !In 1998, the well-known american guitarist Ry Cooder decides to go to Cuba and to record his new CD with cuban musicians. After a few days in the island, he discovers that a certain number of the musicians who made the Cuban sound of the 1930's and the 1940's are still alive. Hypnotized by these legends like Ibrahim Ferrer and Compay Segundo, he produces the record THE BUENA VISTA SOCIAL CLUB with these old guys and organizes two concerts with them, one in Amsterdam and the other at the Carnegie Hall, in New-York.These concerts, along with the studio sessions in La Havana, are the spine of the movie. Interviews with the members of this one-and-only record group in their homes, visits of the heart of La Havana are also going to capture your heart. I'm not a specialist of central america music but I was profoundly moved by these old timers who are certainly the fathers of a great part of what we are listening today.One can also feel the respect of Wim Wenders before these men and women who have preferred to stay, poor and forgotten, in their beloved island, rather than to seek fortune in the U.S.A.Oh yes !

So, along came the releases from Compay, Ibrahim, Omara, Cachaito, Rueben, Afro-Cuban All Stars, etc.  I purchased each and every one, as well as all the subsequent releases.  Compay for instance now has 3 out.  Reuben has 2.  Afro-Cuban have 2 as well.  And a blessing it is.  I pray they continue to pour out the releases.This DVD is the PERFECT visual companion to the cd.  It causes one to FEEL the music that much more.  To know that these are musicians who LIVE what they sing.  They KNOW it.  They are still living in it.  The documentary allows you to become that more a part of what you are hearing.  Then, once you watch this, when you listen to the cd's, you feel that much closer to it and it's much more a part of your soul.It's a dvd filled with concert footage and behind the scenes recording footage.  It's filled with images and interviews on the streets of old Cuba....perhaps that's a bit redundant.  At any rate, it looks like, amidst the crumbling buildings and streets, like Cuba is frozen in time.  Ever since the day of the embargo, things haven't changed.  This is incredibly wonderful and incredibly painful at the same time.Definitely get this dvd.  Definitely get all the cd's you can.  Be careful of BVSC imitators out there however.  As many others have tried to cash in on these artists.  However, be on the lookout for the many artists that actor Andy Garcia is working with and releasing on cd.  He is, remarkably, an incredible trumpet player and is taking painstaking efforts to preserve the same musical heritage as is here.  Also, anything in the &quot;Cubanismo&quot; series is without fault.  Definitely worth looking into.Now, definitely try to act out what I have set forth above.  Add to it a Guyaberra shirt (in your favorite color) and a dancing partner.  Then, roll back the rug on the terrazo floors, and enjoy life.",5,Absolutely incredible!,1008115200,"12 12, 2001",2001,2779,"['have', 'already', 'become', 'familiar', 'beauty', 'Buena', 'Vista', 'Social', 'Club', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'not', ""'ll"", 'hopefully', 'give', 'just', 'idea', 'how', 'incredible', 'truly', 'pretty', 'tough', 'thing', 'do', 'however', 'words', 'do', 'not', 'adequately', 'capture', 'feeling.Something', 'try', 'get', 'good', 'cigar', 'Try', 'nice', 'Ashton', 'Dunhill', 'Victor-Sinclair', 'H.', 'Upmann', 'Punch', 'have', 'good', 'sources', 'crafty', 'customs', 'techniques', 'always', 'incredible', 'Cohiba', 'Next', 'pour', 'very', 'good', 'glass', 'rum', 'rocks', 'adult', 'beverage', 'will', 'do', 'one', 'just', 'well', 'cigar', 'atmosphere', 'Then', 'open', 'windows', 'True', 'only', 'well', 'are', 'decent', 'latitude', 'Next', 'pop', 'dvd', 'Enjoy.This', 'pure', 'beauty', 'discovered', 'BVSC', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'first', 'having', 'purchased', 'BVSC', 'cd', 'was', 'COMPELLED', 'get', 'everything', 'could', 'get', 'hands', 'So', 'came', 'releases', 'Compay', 'Ibrahim', 'Omara', 'Cachaito', 'Rueben', 'Afro-Cuban', 'All', 'Stars', 'etc', 'purchased', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'subsequent', 'releases', 'Compay', 'instance', 'now', '3', 'out', 'Reuben', '2', 'Afro-Cuban', 'have', '2', 'as', 'well', 'blessing', 'pray', 'continue', 'pour', 'out', 'releases.This', 'DVD', 'PERFECT', 'visual', 'companion', 'cd', 'one', 'FEEL', 'music', 'much', 'more', 'know', 'are', 'musicians', 'who', 'LIVE', 'what', 'sing', 'KNOW', 'are', 'still', 'living', 'documentary', 'allows', 'become', 'more', 'part', 'what', 'are', 'hearing', 'Then', 'once', 'watch', 'when', 'listen', 'cd', 'feel', 'much', 'closer', 'much', 'more', 'part', 'soul.It', 'dvd', 'filled', 'concert', 'footage', 'scenes', 'recording', 'footage', 'filled', 'images', 'interviews', 'streets', 'old', 'Cuba', 'bit', 'redundant', 'rate', 'amidst', 'crumbling', 'buildings', 'streets', 'Cuba', 'frozen', 'time', 'Ever', 'day', 'embargo', 'things', 'have', ""n't"", 'changed', 'incredibly', 'wonderful', 'incredibly', 'painful', 'same', 'time.Definitely', 'get', 'dvd', 'Definitely', 'get', 'cd', 'can', 'Be', 'careful', 'BVSC', 'imitators', 'out', 'there', 'however', 'many', 'others', 'have', 'tried', 'cash', 'artists', 'However', 'be', 'lookout', 'many', 'artists', 'actor', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'working', 'releasing', 'cd', 'remarkably', 'incredible', 'trumpet', 'player', 'taking', 'painstaking', 'efforts', 'preserve', 'same', 'musical', 'heritage', 'here', 'Also', 'anything', 'quot', 'Cubanismo', 'quot', 'series', 'fault', 'Definitely', 'worth', 'looking', 'into.Now', 'definitely', 'try', 'act', 'out', 'what', 'have', 'set', 'forth', 'Add', 'Guyaberra', 'shirt', 'favorite', 'color', 'dancing', 'partner', 'Then', 'roll', 'back', 'rug', 'terrazo', 'floors', 'enjoy', 'life']",Buena Vista Social Club VHS

With instruments and forms of music virtually  unaffected by 40 years of pop culture, these superlative musicians will  warm you with their humility and their affection for each other and their  culture, and then thrill you will their rich music.  Cooder, however, did  the musicians a disservice by giving himself and his son such a big  role  in the project.  Cooder's electric guitar doesn't work when it is mixed  with thick, natural sound of the Cuban musicians.  Director Win Wenders  shot a brilliant sequence when legendary pianist Ruben Gonzalez is working  magic on his piano and Cooder interjects with his electric guitar.  Wenders  moves the camera amongst the Cuban musicians while Cooder is playing and  they all have perplexed looks on their faces.  It is a sound that they  obviously are not accustomed to and one that clashes with their natural  sounds.  It's also painful to watch Cooder's son head and shoulder  movements while he plays percussion -- it's something straight out of a  Wayans brother movie.I don't want to seem ungrateful.  Full credit goes  to Cooder for what he has done for these performers and the music world.  These performers obviously have deep affection for Cooder.

It had been the result of American guitarist Roy Cooder's determination to  bring the musical sounds of Cuban music to the public.  He then brought on the German movie director, Wim Wenders, to capture on film the music, the people and Cuba itself.The musicians are elderly, their musical skills developed from childhood and they are living memorials to the music they love.  Once renowned in Cuba in the 40's and 50's, these men have lived through upheaval and changes in their country, and yet approach life with joy and freshness.  The camera picks up the wrinkles, but it also picks up the twinkle in the eye of 91 year old guitarist/singer Compay Segundo who playfully talks about fathering another child to add to his family, or lead singer 70 year-old Ibraham Ferrer's affection for this wife, the 80-year old pianist Ruben Gonzolez who finds it hard to walk, but has no trouble making his fingers fly over the keyboard. Omera Portuando, the lone sultry female, adds an ageless feminine presence to the group.This is not just a movie about the music.  The movie IS the music.  And there are long musical sequences which will delight anyone with a serious musical interest.  The movie is also about the individual people, whose interviews against the backdrop of a crumbling, but lively Cuba are testaments to the human spirit.  Before they were rediscovered  for this film, one of the men was shining shoes;  another was working in a cigar factory.  Politics are never mentioned, but the 1940s and 50s American cars and the disintegrating buildings is evidence of politics gone haywire four decades ago.The movie culminates with a concert in Carnegie Hall and the musicians' first trip to New York.  Their sense of wonder in viewing the skyscrapers, looking at store windows and visiting the Empire State Building is a sharp contrast to the confines of their restricted world in Cuba, which is nevertheless rich with the spirits of this indomitable individuals.The video does lack dramatic tension, and drags in places, but I still don't hesitate to recommend it.

One of the great venues of a time that stretched from the 1930's to the 1950's was the Buena Vista Social Club.  He successfully recruited a group of aging musicians including a couple in their 90's.  The result was a Grammy winning album.Following up a couple years later was this documentary by German director Wim Wenders (""Paris Texas"") with Cooder serving as a guide.  Perhaps surprisingly, the Cuban musicians had aged gracefully and played nearly well as they did in their hey-day.  The heart of the film lies in the individual stories of each artist.  Some remembering even touring in the U. S.  Yet, they knew little of the outside world, living on the crumbling island.  The aging Social Club itself now houses young gymnasts and dancers.Each of the featured performers is vibrant and interesting to listen to.

Epstein ""asanisimasa""","[10, 16]","Can you imagine someone making a documentary about Beethoven and constantly interrupting his symphonies to have a talking head make numerous comments?  To interrupt such magic as heard and performed in this film is just as sacrilege.  There is a particular mood to Cuban music that lifts you up and puts you in another state.  You are lost in movement and colour.  You become a drum, a trumpet, a guitar.  You get out of your chair and dance and hug the air.  Then like some incessant commercial break you are jarred back into reality.  It's SO annoying!  Not to mention that it's hard to really listen to what they are saying when there are still traces of clouds in your brain (ever try to follow a conversation when you're drunk or high?).  Don't get me wrong, I love the interviews, and the scenery and the whole flavour of this film!  I just would have preferred it if Wenders had paid tribute to these performers by letting the music speak its language, then separately, at the beginning or the end, tacked on the interviews and other stuff.  Or at least let two or three songs play through at a time.  I know, there's always the CD one can listen to all the way, but the energy cast off by these performers as you watch them is integral to the music.  That's why people go to see live performances.I'm looking forward to seeing the DVD and hearing the commentary but my dream DVD would have the music and other stuff separate.

We see enough of the Havana streets with their pre-Castro corroding American cars and of the dilapidated grand old architecture to want to see more. Are these images--a kind of ""urban pastoral""--truly representative of the city, or have they been carefully selected for their ripe, romantic decadence? And we hear enough of the music to wish complete exposure if not immersion in its charms. How would it sound without interruptions--by either the intrusion of Wenders' hyperactive cinematic style or the musical presence of the Cooders (father and son)? But Wenders' perpetual-motion camera runs multiple gyres around each subject and edits at a equally frantic pace, obviously assuming the viewer would not sit still for a minute of music unenhanced by visual gymnastics (this must be the unsteadiest Sony ""steadycam"" ever to appear in a film). And if Cuba has indigenous guitarists and trap drummers, Cooder apparently was unable to locate them.I came to this film after being captivated by the similar ""Calle 54."" This too is a film that frequently calls attention to itself through busy editing and frequent camera movement. The difference, however, is that ""Calle 54"" approaches each performance with a primary regard for the music itself. Each musical number is complete, and there is never any doubt that a first priority is to capture the sound of the music with the fullest fidelity possible. As a consequence, the music itself takes up residence in the spectator's consciousness, complemented but not replaced by the accompanying images. ""Buena Vista Social Club"" is more about the covering of an event (the release of the Grammy-winning recording and its aftermath) than the event itself.

The style of narration is quite engrossing especially towards the end where the serendipitious ramblings of  the musicians thru NYC are juxtaposed with snippets of the Carnegie Hall  concert. Some shots drift away and you are not sure why or where - like the  shot where relics of Cuban communism are focused on as the singers sing  about their homeland. Why?Personal highlights of the movie are the duet  session between Omara and Ibrahim - the electricity and respectful tension  in the recording studio are very palpable, the domino playing session  between Pia and friend just before a recording session, the childlike  wonderment of Pia and Ruben as NYC tourists, Omara walking the streets of  Havana and harmonising with a passerby, and the decaying grandeur of Havana  as a backdrop. The profile sessions of the musicians are well documented  and mingles very well with musical performances either in rehersal,  recording or in concert.The only problem I have with this offering is  the Ry Cooder slide guitar flicks on certain songs.

But the idea of discovering a Cuban Nat King Cole is just incredible to me, and you can see and hear it right there. Amazing.  The scenes of the city are just great.  I want to go to Cuba some day. The intro with the photographer showing off some of his best pictures (Fidel Castro at the Lincoln Memorial, which was called ""David and Goliath"" is just great propaganda) is just fantastic documentary-making.",3,A bit dull...,1314316800,"08 26, 2011",2011,713,"['only', 'watched', 'part', 'seemed', 'be', 'mostly', 'recordings', 'piece', 'history', 'musicians', 'film', 'have', 'died', 'want', 'watch', 'again', 'when', 'am', 'more', 'mood', 'kind', 'music', 'have', 'head', 'days', 'Black', 'Sabbath', 'two', 'do', ""n't"", 'blend', 'idea', 'discovering', 'Cuban', 'Nat', 'King', 'Cole', 'just', 'incredible', 'can', 'see', 'hear', 'right', 'there', 'Amazing', 'scenes', 'city', 'are', 'just', 'great', 'want', 'go', 'Cuba', 'day', 'intro', 'photographer', 'showing', 'off', 'best', 'pictures', 'Fidel', 'Castro', 'Lincoln', 'Memorial', 'was', 'called', 'David', 'Goliath', 'just', 'great', 'propaganda', 'just', 'fantastic', 'documentary-making']",Buena Vista Social Club VHS

The  news gives us only part of the story, and most films look at either the  past or are purely political in nature.  Wim Wenders' &quot;The Buena Vista  Social Club&quot; provides a wonderful view of not only life in Cuba today,  but the glorious musical history of Cuba's past.  Forgotten musicians and  vocalists are shown at home, in the recording studio, and in concert  outside of Cuba, performing music that the people know, but apparently  don't (or can't) acknowledge publicly in their own country.  This is a  wonderful slice of life and culture that most Americans have no idea  exists.  Credit should go to Ry Cooder and his son, who comment on what the  music and experience means to them.  An enjoyable documentary.",5,Excellent Music and Real-Life Stories,968630400,"09 11, 2000",2000,797,"['amazing', 'how', 'little', 'most', 'know', 'Cuba', 'people', 'news', 'only', 'part', 'story', 'most', 'films', 'look', 'past', 'are', 'purely', 'political', 'nature', 'Wim', 'Wenders', 'quot', 'Buena', 'Vista', 'Social', 'Club', 'quot', 'wonderful', 'view', 'not', 'only', 'life', 'Cuba', 'today', 'glorious', 'musical', 'history', 'Cuba', 'past', 'Forgotten', 'musicians', 'vocalists', 'are', 'shown', 'home', 'recording', 'studio', 'concert', 'Cuba', 'performing', 'music', 'people', 'know', 'apparently', 'do', ""n't"", 'ca', ""n't"", 'acknowledge', 'publicly', 'own', 'country', 'wonderful', 'slice', 'life', 'culture', 'most', 'Americans', 'have', 'idea', 'Credit', 'should', 'go', 'Ry', 'Cooder', 'son', 'who', 'comment', 'what', 'music', 'experience', 'means', 'enjoyable', 'documentary']",Buena Vista Social Club VHS
