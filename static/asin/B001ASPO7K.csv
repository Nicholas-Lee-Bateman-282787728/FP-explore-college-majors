Tom Hardy did an awesome job in portraying the real life of Stuart Shorter. Mr. Hardy is an exceptional actor who has done remarkable portrayals in all of his movies. He is like a chameleon in that he seems to effortlessly morph or transform himself into the character that he is portraying and somehow make it absolutely 100% believable. In this movie Mr. Hardy did an an excellent job of showing the life, struggles, hardships, and thoughts of Stuart Shorter. It is rare that I like movies based on books (that I have read). However, I think that Hardy, Cumberbatch, and a script that was a great adaptation of the book is what made this such a great movie.My only disappointment has nothing to do with the movie.

I had bought the book, so I then read the book. The book is much much more interesting than the film, and tells much more about Stuart's life - in and out of prison - and quotes Stuart quite a bit about his own life. It also tells about homeless people in more detail than the film does. The author writes intelligently and with humor - the actor in the film seems 2 dimensional in comparison.

1168236,A1L1GM88JCXGLQ,B001ASPO7K,Jackjeanh,"[4, 5]","I have been a fan of Tom Hardy for awhile, and like most nerds, when I am a fan of someone I watch all of their movies. Well, I have seen almost all of Mr. Tom Hardy's movies and I have to say this is THE BEST! At first when I watched it, I wasn't quite sure how I felt about it. It does have a bit of a slow start, but by the time it starts to pick up, you're already hooked! It's different in a truly wonderful way. Mr. Tom Hardy portrays Stuart Shorter, a homeless addict with muscular dystrophy. Benedict Cumberbatch plays Alexander Masters, a young aspiring writer. The movie follows how these two unlikely people develop a very unique friendship when they are united through a campaign. After awhile, Alexander discovers he wants to write a book about his new friend's life. To make it more interesting, Stuart tells him to write it backwards. As you can tell through the first introduction of the movie, Stuart has had a hard life. I won't spoil anything for you, but I can honestly tell you what you dicover about Stuart is heartwrenching. So much so, that you are able to excuse some of his horrific actions and wonder how he is even alive. The way Tom Hardy plays Stuart is so warm, honest and moving, not only did I constantly have goosebumps, but it also moved me to tears. (I won't go into too much detail, but one specific scene comes to mind where he's huddled in his apartment, wielding a knife and shaking in absolute terror. It sounds like a horrible scene, and it is, but because of it you begin to understand Stuart and his inner demons.) Tom Hardy portrays that part with such brilliance that all I wanted to do was go looking for Stuart and just give him a big hug. Really wish this movie had been put on the mainstream, cause Mr. Hardy would have DEFINITELY won an award for this. The fact that he didn't is a true injustice. And Benedict Cumberbatch playing opposite him is truly a wonderful cast. The warmth between the two of them and true bonds of friendship is up on there on the screen for you to see. The quiet way Benedict can kind of digest what Stuart tells him, the way he can act truly horrified with just a look, but spare Stuart an added pain by saying anything, is wonderful. At first you think Alexander is writing this book to make a name for himself. After awhile you realize that he truly cares for this person and wants to be there for him as a friend. It's no longer about fame, money or notoriety, but about telling the story of his friend and sharing the kind person he was with the world. This movie is sad at times, but it's also funny, enlightening, and moving. A REALLY, REALLY GREAT MOVIE! The idea to write it and film the story backwards is utter brilliance. It keeps you hooked while slowly giving you small pieces of the story until the puzzle is finished. Can't say enough about this movie. Feel like I'm on a movie high.

Maybe, I have too much time on my hands, but, if an actor sparks my interest, I will start watching all of their movies. Usually, that amounts to a few movies before I get tired of seeing the same old expressions over and over again. With Tom Hardy, the more I see the more I want to see. He's very refreshing and seems so different in each role. (Okay, some of them have similarities, but the differences are enough to keep his acting interesting to me.)This role is probably my favorite of his so far, but I haven't made my way through everything yet. :) I did recommend the show to a friend, and she didn't like because she said it moved too slow.

This is a movie about the friendship between Alexander (Cumberbatch), who works at a homeless organization and is an aspiring writer and Stuart (Hardy) who is a very troubled homeless man. While it doesn't sound like much,(maybe it does to someone) it was so moving and powerful to watch. Hardy does such a wonderful job of bringing humanity to his character and you can't help but fall in love with this poor soul and wish that his life had been so very different.
