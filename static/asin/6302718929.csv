329143,A969VLBBX8LQ7,6302718929,George McAdams,"[3, 4]","In the late 1970's and early 1980's, Burt Reynolds was at the top of his game.  His movies, while sometimes lacking in depth, were box office smashes.  In between the two movies he starred-in that were directed by Hal Needham, ""Smokey and the Bandit"" and ""Hooper,"" he directed and starred in ""The End,"" a black comedy that was inspired by his own touch with an extended illness.This is a very funny movie in which Reynolds, as Sonny Lawson, a real estate broker who discovers he has a terminal blood disease, decides he cannot wait to die, and he tries, unsuccessfully, to commit suicide, often with the help of Dom DeLuise, a deranged mental patient he meets along the way.Burt has a natural gift for acting in comedy, as was shown in his movies ""Smokey and the Bandit,"" ""The Longest Yard,"" and his television series ""Evening Shade,"" but there are times during ""The End"" where you feel that any other director would have kept him from overacting in several scenes, noteably the fishtank scene in the doctor's office.  Had it not been for those types of scenes, I would have given ""The End"" five stars.One personal note about ""The End."" I remember seeing it at a ""sneak"" preview in Birmingham, Alabama, with Burt, Sally Fields and Hal Needham in the theatre.  Sally and Hal were two rows behind me, and Mr. Reynolds was in the projectionist's room (all of them travelled up to Birmingham from Tuscaloosa, where they were filming ""Hooper."")  The ""preview"" must of been agonizing to Mr. Reynolds because everyone in the theatre was trying to see him, and no one was paying attention to the movie.  After several scenes went by with absolutely no laughs and only after occasional screams from the women in the theatre when someone would say, ""There he is,"" did Mr. Reynolds give-up trying to look through the projectionist's window and resigned himself to sitting away from the projectionist's window until the movie was over.  That was a great evening for a movie goer in Alabama.",4,"""Fifty Percent.  Lord!

329148,A37FUJC2L7DSPT,6302718929,"J. L LaRegina ""Jim LaRegina""","[3, 3]","Few have known the finer things in life better than Burt Reynolds.  Yet in 1978, as his career was moving into the stardom that would make him top film draw several years in a row, he gave us the black comedy THE END, using humor to remind us as well as maybe himself how fleeting success, with all the money, women, and self-aggrandizement, can be.  As his popularity was zooming, Reynolds, directing THE END, seemed to already understand how fortune can quickly evaporate, especially the fortune of life itself, playing a successful realtor whose ""Me Decade"" riches come to mean so little in the face of the ""Why Me?"" diagnosis of a fatal illness.While he wears a full beard in THE END, view the movie's posters and ads displayed here and on other media web sites and you'll note they depict Burt Reynolds' appearance as we think of him, with a moustache but no beard.  But THE END gives us a different Burt Reynolds alright, that full beard just enough distraction to keep us from expecting a fight scene or car chase.  The fire and desire fueling the Burt Reynolds swagger we wish we had quickly dim at the thought of mortality.Other reviews here are right to note that at times the late, great Dom DeLuise steals the show in THE END but I'd like to know if writer Jerry Belson - yes, fans of television's ODD COUPLE, the same Jerry Belson who wrote and directed so many of that program's best episodes - even included the DeLuise character and the theme of funny suicide attempts when he envisioned the story.  It would not surprise me to learn Belson's first drafts of THE END were just about Reynolds' relationships with his ex-wife, daughter, parents, best friend, and girlfriend in light of his illness, with the DeLuise character and suicide gags added only because the producers determined it needed more laughs.  I'll bet an opening scene or two showing Reynolds living a pre-diagnosis high life did not make the final cut so there would be enough time for DeLuise.  After all, leave out Dom DeLuise and you will notice more how Burt Reynolds' character swings back and forth between funny and outright mean.  Give Reynolds credit for taking the risk of playing a guy with streaks of bigotry and misogyny but what people are going to talk about with their friends is the screwball antics with DeLuise.See THE END.",4,Keep your shirt on and leave the Trans Am in the garage,1313798400,"08 20, 2011",2011,2325,"['Few', 'have', 'known', 'finer', 'things', 'life', 'better', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', '1978', 'career', 'was', 'moving', 'stardom', 'would', 'make', 'top', 'film', 'draw', 'several', 'years', 'row', 'gave', 'black', 'comedy', 'THE', 'END', 'using', 'humor', 'remind', 'as', 'well', 'maybe', 'how', 'fleeting', 'success', 'money', 'women', 'self-aggrandizement', 'can', 'be', 'popularity', 'was', 'zooming', 'Reynolds', 'directing', 'THE', 'END', 'seemed', 'already', 'understand', 'how', 'fortune', 'can', 'quickly', 'evaporate', 'especially', 'fortune', 'life', 'playing', 'successful', 'realtor', 'Me', 'Decade', 'come', 'mean', 'so', 'little', 'face', 'Why', 'Me', 'diagnosis', 'fatal', 'illness.While', 'full', 'beard', 'THE', 'END', 'view', 'movie', 'posters', 'ads', 'displayed', 'here', 'other', 'media', 'web', 'sites', ""'ll"", 'note', 'depict', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'appearance', 'think', 'moustache', 'beard', 'THE', 'END', 'different', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'alright', 'full', 'beard', 'just', 'enough', 'distraction', 'keep', 'expecting', 'fight', 'scene', 'car', 'chase', 'fire', 'desire', 'fueling', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'swagger', 'wish', 'had', 'quickly', 'dim', 'thought', 'mortality.Other', 'reviews', 'here', 'are', 'right', 'note', 'times', 'late', 'great', 'Dom', 'DeLuise', 'show', 'THE', 'END', ""'d"", 'like', 'know', 'writer', 'Jerry', 'Belson', 'yes', 'fans', 'television', 'ODD', 'COUPLE', 'same', 'Jerry', 'Belson', 'who', 'wrote', 'directed', 'so', 'many', 'program', 'best', 'even', 'included', 'DeLuise', 'character', 'theme', 'funny', 'suicide', 'attempts', 'when', 'envisioned', 'story', 'would', 'not', 'surprise', 'learn', 'Belson', 'first', 'drafts', 'THE', 'END', 'were', 'just', 'Reynolds', 'relationships', 'ex-wife', 'daughter', 'parents', 'best', 'friend', 'girlfriend', 'light', 'illness', 'DeLuise', 'character', 'suicide', 'gags', 'added', 'only', 'producers', 'determined', 'needed', 'more', 'laughs', ""'ll"", 'bet', 'opening', 'scene', 'two', 'showing', 'Reynolds', 'living', 'pre-diagnosis', 'high', 'life', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'final', 'cut', 'so', 'there', 'would', 'be', 'enough', 'time', 'DeLuise', 'leave', 'out', 'Dom', 'DeLuise', 'will', 'notice', 'more', 'how', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'character', 'swings', 'back', 'forth', 'funny', 'outright', 'mean', 'Give', 'Reynolds', 'credit', 'taking', 'risk', 'playing', 'guy', 'streaks', 'bigotry', 'misogyny', 'what', 'people', 'are', 'going', 'talk', 'friends', 'screwball', 'antics', 'DeLuise.See', 'THE', 'END']",N/A
