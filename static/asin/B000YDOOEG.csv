Ludens ""Midnight Reader""","[0, 0]","The story here is a little flimsy, and at times the ""rat/people/zombies"" looked kinda silly, but overall I very much enjoyed this one. The cast was very ""average joe"", like you could run into any of these people on the street.  This lent a realism to the film that so many other movies lack.  I also enjoyed the cinematography quite a bit.  Instead of making everything too dark as so many horror films do, instead we get our heroes fleeing to a rooftop in a washed out shade of blue, while the government haz mat team is filmed in bright yellow and orange ascending the stairs. Doesn't sound like much but little touches like that made the film visually interesting to watch.  Another example is a very brief shot of what looks like two yellow lights on the street, then one turns to red and the viewer realizes the second yellow light is actually the moon.

She really enjoyed it.  The story and characters have been described before so I won't.  But what I had to talk about is that this movie doesn't descend into the depths of humanity. It goes for the goodness of people.  Sounds a little strange, what I'm trying to say is that it isn't like the 'Night of the Living Dead' with the man hiding his family in the cellar and fighting off the other people.  The people here are neighbors and they act like it.  They try to help each other, even if it cost them their lives.  The people are real, with faults and all, but there is no greedy or cowardly idiot like almost every horror film has.  It was one of the first After Dark Horrorfest movies and it's why I try to pick them up every year.

A small group of apartment building tenants must make their final stand against the marauding hordes of murderous mutants! MULBERRY ST. is a micro-budget movie that actually works. Costing far less than $100K, the acting, writing, and inventive camera work combine to make it loads more fun than most zillion-dollar hollywood epics.

MULBERRY STREET is easily one of the best independent Horror entries acquired by the After Dark Horrorfest series. It manages to create a huge look and feel on a tiny scale. What makes the film so effective is its emphasis on character, establishing flawed, raw, but genuine personas that carry the plot through its slow build. Jim Mickle also utilizes the crude look of the digital photography along with putrid color filters and dilapidated sets to give the impression of a devastating citywide epidemic much to the same extent that Danny Boyle had done in 28 DAYS LATER. The film also cleverly injects a biting injunction against urban renewal when it comes at the cost of ruining people's lives and destroying their homes.

1119018,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000YDOOEG,Chris Pandolfi,"[32, 33]","""Mulberry Street"" is not so much about rats who turn humans into flesh-eating monsters in New York City. It's much more basic than that: it's all about tension and about how much can be crammed into a single story. The rats are more of an afterthought, really--they may serve as the catalyst for a medical crisis, but when their job is done, they conveniently disappear. That's a good thing, because at a certain point, we don't pay attention to them anymore. What we do pay attention to is how the tension builds. And that's why this movie is so effective; it does nothing but build itself up, and it keeps building even during the end credits. I repeatedly asked myself what would happen next, and that's always the sign of a good horror film, especially one so taut, brooding, and fatalistic.The best thing is that it tells an understandable story without lingering on extensive character development. The first named billed in the opening credits is Nick Damici, but that doesn't mean he plays the main character. I don't think there is a main character in this film; it takes place in a rundown New York City apartment located on Mulberry Street, and the people who inhabit it live in a kind of community. Damici plays an aging boxer named Clutch, who eagerly awaits a visit from his daughter. Clutch's friend is Coco (Ron Brice), a gay man who probably has stronger feelings for Clutch than he would care to admit. But Clutch seems to show an interest in Kay (Bo Corre), a single mom who gets by as a bartender. Her son, Ross (Tim House), is a detached teenager, showing no interest in school or in life. The only thing he seems to be interested in is photography, and he takes plenty of pictures even within the confines of his room. The building's elderly men--Charlie (Larry Fleischman) and Frank (Larry Medich)--function on dependent levels; one wheels an oxygen tank around while the other seems to be getting confused about things.The one character who exists outside of the apartment complex is Clutch's daughter, Casey (Kim Blair), a military officer on her way home from serving in Iraq. Her face is covered with scars, and she tires to cover them up by letting her bangs down. She initially doesn't say or do much, but we still get the sense that's she's incredibly insecure about the way she looks, and is probably more insecure about her military status. There's a moment when a train platform custodian thanks her for her service to her country; she says a polite thank you, but doesn't express any pride or show any sense of accomplishment. In a later scene, in which she rides a train, a woman talking on a cell phone sits in front of her. This woman gives subtle yet significant signals, indicating that Casey's scars are making her uncomfortable. Casey picks up on this, and tries to compensate by letting her bangs down once again.It isn't until the rat crisis that she begins to apply herself. The same can be said for the characters in the apartment complex--a large rat, thought to be dead, bites the building's superintendent. Soon after, he begins to feel funny. Hair grows on top of his ears. His sense of smell becomes inhumanly strong. He develops a taste for raw meat. The tenants don't suspect anything until they start watching the news; apparently, a full-blown epidemic has taken hold of New York City, one so deadly that the American government has decided to quarantine Manhattan. Rats have bitten people all over the city, and it doesn't take long for these people to transform into mutant creatures with a taste for human meat. It quickly becomes a matter of survival, pitting a handful of Mulberry Street residents against an entire apartment full of flesh eaters.I'm probably making this film sound like a low-tread rehash, but that really isn't the case. This is a story that doesn't depend on a scary idea, but rather on how it shapes itself around a scary idea. Since many of the characters are engulfed in shadow, and since most of the terror is hidden in complete darkness, not much is seen when the creatures attack. A lot of what happens to the victims is left up to the imagination, and that's rarely done in horror movies these days; we have to think about their fates, and thinking is always scarier than actually seeing. There a point at which one creature is trapped in Clutch's closet; when Coco reopens the door he sees that the creature has chewed its way through the ceiling, meaning that it's now loose within the walls of the apartment complex. It doesn't matter where it went or if we even see it again--all that matters is that we no longer see it and that we don't know what will happen next.The concept of rat/human hybrids terrorizing New York is downright silly, yet the people behind ""Mulberry Street"" were able to make it seem real. And consider the fact that a hint of satire runs all throughout: a billboard for developer displays the slogan ""The Neighborhood is Changing,"" and a newscaster solemnly reports that help isn't arriving fast enough for the hundreds left alive in Manhattan. The President (whoever that is in this story) has declared a state of emergency, but information is being gathered too slowly to be of any real help. This only adds to the sense of isolation felt by the Mulberry Street tenants, increasing that overwhelming sense of What Now. This is a dark, unnerving story, one that refuses to let the audience relax.",4,"Oh, Rats!",1194739200,"11 11, 2007",2007,5410,"['Mulberry', 'Street', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'rats', 'who', 'turn',

I went into watching it with an open mind because some of the After Dark films turn out to be crap but with this one, you actually start hoping the characters will make it through, even though you are pretty sure that they won't.The characters are all living in a run downed apartment building in N.Y. and there was no surprise to me that it did have rats anyway. An epidemic breaks out because rats start biting people around the city and all hell breaks loose. Certain people in the building get bit and then it's an allout race as to who can defend themselves and who can't. Check it out and watch the WHOLE film.

The genius behind the film is the excellent writing that focuses on the depth of relationships between the characters.  As the film starts off, you get a glimpse of the various characters going through another day in their lives.  Meanwhile, you catch glimpses on the TVs in the background that something bad is beginning to happen in New York, but life goes on.  The spreading epidemic is nothing but background noise.Needless to say, the situation spirals out of control and hits home as the tenants of the building fight for lives as the city falls apart around them.  I almost cried twice, but the end had me bawling (and I was not the only man in the theater who was reduced to tears, but the intense emotional climax of the film).The writer/star of the film wrote a prior film about the unspoken love between men and that theme returns in this film as a gay tenant struggles with unrequited love.

This one has all the right story elements I crave and a gritty, realistic style that doesn't try to fake.The acting is solid for a bunch of unknowns, which is good as the director really cared enough about the story to give us the best of the best. The story is well-thought out and incredibly creepy. I once had a dream about rats and this is like that nightmare only ten fold.I love the suspenseful pacing as when the stuff hits the fan it goes into a frenzy! I love the music in the barroom when the rat people begin attacking, very wonderful and carefully timed moment in the film.The story revolves around the tenants of Mulberry St. aparment complex scheduled to be torn down because of a big shot developer in town. The big thing I noticed is that the developer is acknowledged, but not enough to be distracting like a random scene where he is acting villianously. This would've killed the momentum here, as the story is about the people of Mulberry St., not the developer. So future director's please note you don't have to over do the villian, just make him present.Mulberry Street makes you care for it's people as it's everyday Joe Lunchbox, your friends and neighbors, that dysfunctional family down the street. Average people suddenly thrust into this out-of-control situation slowly building in the background. What's great about the film is the tension is like a rubber band, when it breaks, it explodes in your face and all hell breaks loose.The film has a very unique look to it as well, ranging from the artsy cover-your-hind-end shots to build up the story, to the gritty-down-in-the-trenches-filming-a-war shots that accent the action. Mulberry Street has atmosphere! Oh boy does it have atmosphere and does it play it up well. It's creepy and gritty, then it's sunshine and blue skies, alternating to make the horror all the more creepy.One of my favorite scenes is the when the daughter is returning from Iraq and she's running on foot through the park. The playground is obviously in shambles, hinting at something terrible happening without a dead body in sight, making the panic more believable when you hear the distant screams.And while you rarely see the monsters, you know they're there, hiding in the walls and crawling through the roof (one instance a chimney).In all I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS FILM! Absolutely!

I can only imagine that the reviewers are not horror afficionados and so their ability to be startled and scared are somewhat lower than your usual horror fan.The first problem with ""Mulberry Street"" is that it takes much too long to start. Too much background information that could've been inserted during breaks in the action and very slow progression of incidents leading to the fun of Act 2. And as for the action and suspense, the director fails to provide any real thrills and chills with the shaky camera movment just becoming annoying after awhile. With films like ""30 Days of  Night,"" ""28 Weeks Later,"" and the Resident Evil series bringing the ""mankind vs. the maddening hoards"" premise to new and more interesting levels, ""Mulberry Street,"" fails to bring anything new or interesting to the genre. Besides this, the somewhat double ending was odd and unsatisfying leaving me and other viewers to wonder if the two male leads had a relationship.While not terribly awful, nor as bad as some of the Sci-Fi Channel fare, you'll wish you had spent your time otherwise instead of wasting it on ""Mulberry Street.""",2,Competent acting but weak execution,1209340800,"04 28, 2008",2008,1185,"['Based', 'reviews', 'here', 'imdb', 'was', 'expecting', 'lot', 'more', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'reviewers', 'are', 'not', 'horror', 'afficionados', 'so', 'ability', 'be', 'startled', 'scared', 'are', 'somewhat', 'lower', 'usual', 'horror', 'fan.The', 'first', 'problem', 'Mulberry', 'Street', 'much', 'too', 'long', 'start', 'Too', 'much', 'background', 'information', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'inserted', 'breaks', 'action', 'very', 'slow', 'progression', 'incidents', 'leading', 'fun', 'Act', '2', 'action', 'suspense', 'director', 'provide', 'real', 'thrills', 'chills', 'shaky', 'camera', 'movment', 'just', 'becoming', 'annoying', 'awhile', 'films', '30', 'Days', 'Night', '28', 'Weeks', 'Later', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'series', 'bringing', 'mankind', 'maddening', 'hoards', 'premise', 'new', 'more', 'interesting', 'levels', 'Mulberry', 'Street', 'bring', 'anything', 'new', 'interesting', 'genre', 'somewhat', 'double', 'ending', 'was', 'odd', 'unsatisfying', 'leaving', 'other', 'viewers', 'wonder', 'two', 'male', 'leads', 'had', 'relationship.While', 'not', 'terribly', 'awful', 'as', 'bad', 'Sci-Fi', 'Channel', 'fare', ""'ll"", 'wish', 'had', 'spent', 'time', 'otherwise', 'instead', 'wasting', 'Mulberry', 'Street']",N/A
1119034,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000YDOOEG,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[4, 5]","Both last year when I got to see the original After Dark Horrorfest in the theater and this year when I had to wait until they came out on DVD, I managed to watch almost all of this films without knowing anything about what they were.  The streak ended with ""Mulberry St,"" because in addition to having a suggestive tag-line for the film (""There's something below us worse than Hell""), the cover of this DVD has a quote from Bloodydisgusting.com that this is ""A 'Zombie' film that breaks the mold.""  Last year when there were a couple dozen of us who were seeing the 8 films 2 die 4 in the afternoon one of the guys sitting in front of me (we pretty much sat in the same places each day) missed the beginning of ""Wicked Little Things"" I quickly filled him in on the prologue and added that this was probably the zombie film.  For some reason we thought that the eight films would represent eight different genres: e.g., oneJapanese ghost movie, oneDark, one [[vampire flick]], etc.  Okay, so we were wrong for thinking there was a rhyme or reason to how Lionsgate picked these films out of their massive DTV bin.Consequently I was aware that ""Mulberry St"" was a zombie film when I put it in last night, although to be fair it is really a ""zombie"" movie, the punctuation indicating that technically all of the hungry people in this 2006 flick are neither dead nor living dead, ergo, not zombies.  The story is set in New York City where a deadly infection transmitted by rats turns the citizenry into flesh-eating non-zombies.  So you know this is a ""they're coming to get you, ha-haaa!"" film, and you can discover the rest for yourself.  The title of the film  (a nod toDr Seussperhaps?) is something of a misnomer, because this is not about all of the people on that particular street reacting to what is going on, but rather focuses instead on six recently evicted tenants who are trying to stay alive inside their crumbling apartment building.  But since the building does not appear to have a name (at least not one that I remember), the street name makes more sense.  The strength of this film, especially compared to other Horrorfest offerings, is that we have a real sense of the individual characters.  I also liked the way the apartment building and the things that people had in their apartments became critical parts of the fight to stave alive.  My main complaint with ""Mulberry St"" is that it takes a while to get to the good stuff, and while I acknowledge that the time is spent developing the aforementioned characters, I still thought things were dragging out a bit and was about to zone out on the film when things finally hit the fan.This movie is primarily Jim Mickle's baby.  In addition to directing the film and co-writing it with actor Nick Damici (who plays Clutch), Mickle gets screen credits for editing, sound, and visual effects.  So what you see is what he wanted, and the net results are pretty good.  This is a horror film where you can have a favorite character who may or may not be the ""hero/ine"" and know that they are going to have their moment.  I picked up a definite ""Night of the Living Dead"" vibe from the film, and that did indeed turn out to be the case, albeit it a bit more proactive (think ""Straw Dogs"" and finding things around the house to use as weapons).  My understanding is Mickle shot this movie on location and that it is Damici's apartment, redressed several times for the various occupants, where most of the action takes place.  Plus, Mickle gets a bit lyrical at the end, which is not inappropriate given the care with which he has crafted his little film.This concludes my run of one 2007 After Dark Horrorfest movies late at night and part of the reason I decided to round up on ""Mulberry St"" is that it is one of only three of the 8 films 2 die 4 that actually has bonus features on the DVD besides (all together now) the Miss Horrorfest Contest webepisodes.  In addition to deleted scenes there are also outtakes, storyboards, early director sketches, tests for makeup and visual effects, and a behind the scenes bit on the rats.  None of these were outstanding, but it was nice just to see evidence that these filmmakers had worked stuff out before they shot the film (maybe the rest lake these bonus features because they did not do this sort of prep work--it would explain a lot).

1119035,A17BUUBOU0598B,B000YDOOEG,"Mark ""Technology, Music and Movies""","[0, 0]","Mulberry Streetreally caught me off guard.  Given the limited budget, they made several good decisions with this movie.  They clearly avoided casting the biggest names they could, and instead cast actors who were good for their roles.  And they also developed the characters in the story before unleashing the horror element on them, an epidemic of diseased rats that overtake New York City.  So despite a story that is difficult to sell, this movie comes out looking better than most ADHF features have.A better title would have helped to make the movie more sellable.  In this case, they are selling the city. It's not clear why they chose Mulberry Street over Lafayette or any number of New York city streets.  Still it's a relatively minor point.The movie also does a good job of blending enjoyable horror in with the human interest stories and possibly deeper layers of meaning.  We care about the characters as we watch things unfold.  It's enough to allow us to ignore the other silly aspect to the movie, which is the effects of being bitten by the rats on the appearance of the infected.  Granted, there are a lot of ""zombie / infection"" movies, like28 Days Laterand28 Weeks Later.  Like most good zombie film, the infection is a part of the story and does not overtake character development or plot structure.The plot lines of the various characters do overlap and intersect somewhat.  Once again, this movie clearly operated on a tight budget.  But they deserve credit for at least producing a watchable feature.  That's more than many big budget horror movies can say for themselves.ConclusionDespite the cheeky story, this is an entertaining movie that is interesting and fun to watch. For me this is a 3, but I can definitely see an argument for a 4.  But whether it's a three star or a four star movie, it's worth renting at least once.

On the one hand we viewed it as the centerpiece of the world - everything new, trendy, and interesting appeared there first and made its way to the surrounding tri-state area.  On the other hand, it was dangerous, dingy, and frequently disgusting.  My grandfather lived in a ""railroad apartment"" with walls that had never been repainted and floors that were never cleaned.  And that's the setting for Mulberry Street.Anyone who has been in one of these apartments knows them on sight, and Mulberry Street is so authentic that you can practically smell the musty rooms. The camera's claustrophobic view of the interior apartments hides nothing - this isn't a movie filmed in Canada pretending to be in New York.  It's the unglamorous, gritty side of the city that is everyday life for so many New Yawkers.Unfortunately, Mulberry Street has several strikes against it.  Let's start with the title: Yes, it's a street in Manhattan, but it's also the name of a Dr. Seuss book.  The plot, which is essentially a zombie survival horror sans zombies, features an infection carried by (SQUEAKING SPOILER) rats.  Yes, rats. Wererats, to use a Dungeons & Dragons term.  Infected rats in the sewers begin biting people, which in turn transforms the civilian populace into flesh-eating rat-people.  In full light, they look about as ridiculous as it sounds.Director Jim Mickle wisely spends his $60,000 budget by using old military props, keeping the camera's focus tight, and the scenes dark.  The infection spreads throughout New York City and the film's plot, from rat to little girl to building super, told mostly through radio and television broadcasts. The cast of characters includes the washed-up boxer Clutch (Nick Damici), his Iraq-war veteran daughter Casey (Kim Blair) who is ashamed of her internal and external scars, Clutch's gay long-time friend Coco (Ron Brice), attractive but haggard mother Kay (Bo Corre), her truant son Otto (Javier Picayo), and the requisite cranky old men: oxygen-dependent Charlie (Larry Fleischman) and his addled friend Frank (Larry Medich).The film subtly demonstrates how the apartment complex is a complicated web of small interpersonal bonds that form a larger family.  Much of Mulberry Street's horror is watching it unravel: between roommates, between parent and child, and between perfect strangers.

I thought the idea of rats passing on the virus or whatever to humans who then became more and more rat-like and cannibalistic was really clever.  It's too bad that the movie took that idea and ran away from it instead of with it.The acting was decent.  You managed to have the opportunity to get to know the main characters well enough to care (or not care) about them as the film progressed.  I enjoyed the idea of the man who was loved by all but basically kept his thoughts and feelings to himself.  I liked the idea of the gay male who was so friendly to everyone.  I even liked the idea of the daughter coming home to hell after her tour of duty.  But, then, like a bolt of lightning, everything burned at the end.

In New York City, something is very, very wrong with the rat population.  The people that they bite are turning into mutant beasts with a taste for human flesh, and it isn't long before the denziens of a run down apartment building are fending them off to survive as the city soon comes under martial law.

I really wish this same thing would happen with character driven zombie films.Mulberry Street is one of those. An epidemic in New York turns everyone rabid and the close-knit residents of an apartment complex join together to hole up and fight it off. The characters were great, the father reuniting with his daughter finally coming home after being injured in the army, the old best friend who have lived in their apartment for 50 years, and all the peripherals were done wonderfully. The acting was definitely impressive. I have to admit I was convinced.Unfortunately, I've been convinced before. Lots of times. The locales, the characters, the subplots, the start of the epidemic all have changed, but the core has not. And frankly, I'm feeling the genre was already bursting at the seams of over-saturation a few years back. Granted, there have been a films have been the exception by squeaking in with a fantastic twist or hook or just absolutely stellar comedy, but this hasn't done it.And speaking of comedy, I couldn't help wondering why this wasn't one. New York gets invaded by RAT PEOPLE. At first contamination, the people still look somewhat human but by the end of the film all the RAT PEOPLE look like a bunch of rodent versions of Count Orloks from Nosferatu with their long noses and hungry eyes. I can't imagine why this movie was played straight. With the characters and subplots written convincingly enough, and the fact that they strayed from inserting typical virus-spawned zombies, I believe the writers could have delivered on some truly golden comedy.Instead, I'm left watching goofy, crazy rat people plod around, attacking people like zombies have always attacked people (albeit with a couple of instances of crawling through walls), filmed like zombies attacking people has always been filmed, paced like every film of zombies attacking people has ever been paced, and leaving me just plain bored.I see that Director/Co-Writer Jim Mickle has a new film coming out this year called Stake Land and Mulberry Street certainly gave me enough to have interest in catching this one, but it didn't give me enough interest in itself, sadly.I suppose if you've managed to never see a character driven zombie film, it's a pretty good one. But if you've already seen a few or, like me, well more than your fair share, it's a little bit too late in the game and its new addition of rat people would be better suited to a comedy.I was really feeling 2 1/2 stars on this one, but since it really wouldn't be a bad place to start getting into this kind of film I swayed towards 3. I'm just not going to recommend it to any of my fellow zombie movie gluttons--unless after all the zombie films you've seen you've always imagined a movie where Count Orlok splices his genes with a rat, clones himself, and invades New York...and that you've always imagined this movie being played dead straight without any camp value to be found.",3,Mulberry Street,1266796800,"02 22, 2010",2010,3096,"['know', 'how', 'Toho', 'Production', 'bunch', 'Godzilla', 'films', 'then', 'public', 'interest', 'peters', 'out', 'decide', 'go', 'hiatus', 'decade', 'more', 'really', 'wish', 'same', 'thing', 'would', 'happen', 'character', 'driven', 'zombie', 'films.Mulberry', 'Street', 'one', 'epidemic', 'New', 'York', 'everyone', 'rabid', 'close-knit', 'residents', 'apartment', 'complex', 'join', 'together', 'hole', 'up', 'fight', 'off', 'characters', 'were', 'great', 'father', 'reuniting', 'daughter', 'finally', 'coming', 'home', 'being', 'injured', 'army', 'old', 'best', 'friend', 'who', 'have', 'lived', 'apartment', '50', 'years', 'peripherals', 'were', 'done', 'wonderfully', 'acting', 'was', 'definitely', 'impressive', 'have', 'admit', 'was', 'convinced.Unfortunately', ""'ve"", 'been', 'convinced', 'Lots', 'times', 'locales', 'characters', 'subplots', 'start', 'epidemic', 'have', 'changed', 'core', 'not', 'frankly', ""'m"", 'feeling', 'genre', 'was', 'already', 'bursting', 'seams', 'over-saturation', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'Granted', 'have', 'been', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'exception', 'squeaking', 'fantastic', 'twist', 'hook', 'just', 'absolutely', 'stellar', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'done', 'it.And', 'speaking', 'comedy', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'wondering', 'why', 'was', ""n't"", 'one', 'New', 'York', 'invaded', 'RAT', 'PEOPLE', 'first', 'contamination', 'people', 'still', 'look', 'somewhat', 'human', 'end', 'film', 'RAT', 'PEOPLE', 'look', 'bunch', 'rodent', 'versions', 'Count', 'Orloks', 'Nosferatu', 'long', 'noses', 'hungry', 'eyes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'why', 'movie', 'was', 'played', 'straight', 'characters', 'subplots', 'written', 'convincingly', 'enough', 'fact', 'strayed', 'inserting', 'typical', 'virus-spawned', 'zombies', 'believe', 'writers', 'could', 'have', 'delivered', 'truly', 'golden', 'comedy.Instead', ""'m"", 'left', 'watching', 'goofy', 'crazy', 'rat', 'people', 'plod', 'around', 'attacking', 'people', 'zombies', 'have', 'always', 'attacked', 'people', 'couple', 'instances', 'crawling', 'walls', 'filmed', 'zombies', 'attacking', 'people', 'always', 'been', 'filmed', 'paced', 'film', 'zombies', 'attacking', 'people', 'ever', 'been', 'paced', 'leaving', 'just', 'plain', 'bored.I', 'see', 'Director/Co-Writer', 'Jim', 'Mickle', 'new', 'film', 'coming', 'out', 'year', 'called', 'Stake', 'Land', 'Mulberry', 'Street', 'certainly', 'gave', 'enough', 'have', 'interest', 'catching', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'enough', 'interest', 'sadly.I', 'suppose', ""'ve"", 'managed', 'never', 'see', 'character', 'driven', 'zombie', 'film', 'pretty', 'good', 'one', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'few', 'well', 'more', 'fair', 'share', 'little', 'bit', 'too', 'late', 'game', 'new', 'addition', 'rat', 'people', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'suited', 'comedy.I', 'was', 'really', 'feeling', '2', '1/2', 'stars', 'one', 'really', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'bad', 'place', 'start', 'getting', 'kind', 'film', 'swayed', 'towards', '3', ""'m"", 'just', 'not', 'going', 'recommend', 'fellow', 'zombie', 'movie', 'gluttons', 'zombie', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', ""'ve"", 'always', 'imagined', 'movie', 'where', 'Count', 'Orlok', 'genes', 'rat', 'clones', 'New', 'York', ""'ve"", 'always', 'imagined', 'movie', 'being', 'played', 'dead', 'straight', 'camp', 'value', 'be', 'found']",N/A

I really enjoyed this flick unlike some of the other uneven offerings we usually get with this series.This movie builds characterization, suspense, a sincere feeling of dread and is truly a ""horror"" film!  Hallelujah!  I think the best way to see this movie is on a big screen at home, watching this in the theater I would probably have been motion sick because I don't think the camera ever stops moving but that's not a bad thing.The story revolves around an epidemic that is breaking out around New York of random violent acts.  What is causing this?  Rats are biting people turning them into rat zombies.  Sure it may sound stupid but it is a really unique horror film and the pace is set very quickly early on.  The story is basically a rundown apartment complex is being overtaken by rats that turn people into zombies.  While this doesn't sound like much, it's the way the characters interact with each other that gets the most attention.  There are some eerie scenes and enough blood to please the gore fans but it's not just a blood and guts movie.  It really analyzes the relationships of the tenants and how they handle/help each other during the crisis.  It's really a story of how during adverse conditions people really pull together to help each other.This movie is definitely worth your time and you will also probably find it an enjoyable way to spend 84 minutes.The extras on the disc are minimal, I believe there were only 2 deleted scenes and just a few outtakes but while low on the special features this film really delivers a punch.",4,The Horror of the Rats,1231977600,"01 15, 2009",2009,1625,"['Well', 'was', 'nice', 'surprise', '2nd', 'group', 'Dark', 'movies', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'flick', 'other', 'uneven', 'offerings', 'usually', 'get', 'series.This', 'movie', 'builds', 'characterization', 'suspense', 'sincere', 'feeling', 'dread', 'truly', 'horror', 'film', 'Hallelujah', 'think', 'best', 'way', 'see', 'movie', 'big', 'screen', 'home', 'watching', 'theater', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'been', 'motion', 'sick', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'camera', 'ever', 'moving', 'not', 'bad', 'thing.The', 'story', 'epidemic', 'breaking', 'out', 'New', 'York', 'random', 'violent', 'acts', 'What', 'causing', 'Rats', 'are', 'biting', 'people', 'turning', 'rat', 'zombies', 'Sure', 'may', 'sound', 'stupid', 'really', 'unique', 'horror', 'film', 'pace', 'set', 'very', 'quickly', 'early', 'story', 'basically', 'rundown', 'apartment', 'complex', 'being', 'overtaken', 'rats', 'turn', 'people', 'zombies', ""n't"", 'sound', 'much', 'way', 'characters', 'interact', 'other', 'most', 'attention', 'are', 'eerie', 'scenes', 'enough', 'blood', 'please', 'gore', 'fans', 'not', 'just', 'blood', 'guts', 'movie', 'really', 'relationships', 'tenants', 'how', 'handle/help', 'other', 'crisis', 'really', 'story', 'how', 'adverse', 'conditions', 'people', 'really', 'pull', 'together', 'help', 'other.This', 'movie', 'definitely', 'worth', 'time', 'will', 'also', 'probably', 'find', 'enjoyable', 'way', 'spend', '84', 'minutes.The', 'extras', 'disc', 'are', 'minimal', 'believe', 'were', 'only', '2', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'just', 'few', 'outtakes', 'low', 'special', 'features', 'film', 'really', 'punch']",N/A
1119045,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000YDOOEG,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 2]","Mulberry Street (Jim Mickle, 2006)28 Days Later... ripoff that could have been so much better than it is, but actually isn't half bad. Co-written by Mickle and star Nick Damici (In the Cut), featuring cameos from Larry Fessenden and Debbie Rochon, and about a plague of mutant rats chowing down on New York City--what's not to like?Plot: the rats in New York turn deadly after mutating; their bites turn New Yorkers into bloodthirsty homicidal maniacs. The action revolves around a tenement building on Mulberry Street whose surviving tenants--including an ex-boxer (Damici), a drag queen (Basquiat's Ron Brice), a barmaid (Sad Spanish Song's Bo Corre) and her son (Maid in Manhattan's Javier Picayo), and a World War II vet (Larry Medich) and his son (Fast Horses' Larry Fleischman). Oh, and there's the boxer's daughter (Our Lady of Victory's Kim Blair), home from the Iraq War, trying to get back to the building, but having a hard time after the city shuts down the subway system because of the rat attacks.What's not to like? Well, I don't want to spoil the surprise for you, but let me just say that this would have been just as good a movie--no, a much better movie--without the credited ""creature effects"". All you have to do is turn people into bloodthirsty killers and you've got yourself a story. You don't need to turn them into monsters as well, unless you've got a portion of your budget specifically earmarked for special effects. I knew the flick was going to go downhill early on, when the building super (Tim House), who's been bitten by a rat, starts growing hair on his ears very quickly. Oh, no, I thought, you're not going to take this really fine little horror flick, which is actually working as a suspense film during the inevitably slow beginning, and try to turn it into a generic monster movie, are you? Oh, but they did. I almost wept.The other major problem the movie has is that there are so many places where the script starts to branch out into complex, interesting character development, so many stubs that tell us that given a little more time and another rewrite or so this movie would have given us a plethora of characters we could have come to care about. None of those stubs, however, ended up growing legs. There's an aborted romantic subplot, a lot of backstory with the boxer's daughter and what happened to her overseas (though I was impressed they scrapped the almost-inevitable teary comparison between the horrors of war and the horrors of rat-bitten homicidal maniacs), some bonding between the barmaid's son and the boxer that never goes anywhere, a bit of weirdness with the (stereotypical, but hey) creepy super, all of which could have been expanded, but never went anywhere. Depressing. But I chose to look at this as a movie made by a couple of guys who really have the potential to get good at this moviemaking thing, and with Larry Fessenden coming onboard (his production company is bankrolling Mickle's next film, also co-written by Damici), I have high hopes that some of that potential will be realized next time out. I'll be looking forward to seeing what they come up with. ** ",3,Could have been awesome.

1119046,A2D1F0HWHN4T1U,B000YDOOEG,Robert,"[4, 4]","My expectations have generally been low for horrorfest films, and most of the titles in this batch have done little to change my mind. However, Mulberry Street is a character driven film that actually indulges emotions deeper than simply fright and the desire for bloodlust. There has been mention of the similarities to 28 Days, but that was far more global. Where Mulberry differentiates itself is in the characters it develops both before any of the horrors occur, as well as during the chaos. We are introduced early to a small group of people with ties to, where else, a Mulberry Street tenement. Their reactions, relationships, challenges, and fears are followed throughout the film while the rest of the city collapses around them. The antagonist of the story, if you will, is a virus derived from rats causing residents to become enraged, flesh-starved beasts. While there are plenty of the graphic scenes that are typical in a movie like this, the focus remains on the plight of our small band of tenants. Because we know them and do care, their collective fates do concern us, and there is an emotional resonance to their suffering. Some are the moments are frightful, many heart-wrenching, but all heartfelt. There is a feeling that this is a drama placed in a horror setting, and it doesn't disappoint.",4,My favorite from last year's horrorfest,1206403200,"03 25, 2008",2008,1314,"['expectations', 'have', 'generally', 'been', 'low', 'horrorfest', 'films', 'most', 'titles', 'batch', 'have', 'done', 'little', 'change', 'mind', 'However', 'Mulberry', 'Street', 'character', 'driven', 'film', 'actually', 'emotions', 'deeper', 'simply', 'fright', 'desire', 'bloodlust', 'been', 'mention', 'similarities', '28', 'Days', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'global', 'Where', 'Mulberry', 'characters', 'horrors', 'occur', 'as', 'well', 'chaos', 'are', 'introduced', 'early', 'small', 'group', 'people', 'ties', 'where', 'else', 'Mulberry', 'Street', 'tenement', 'reactions', 'relationships', 'challenges', 'fears', 'are', 'followed', 'film', 'rest', 'city', 'antagonist', 'story', 'will', 'virus', 'derived', 'rats', 'causing', 'residents', 'become', 'enraged', 'flesh-starved', 'beasts', 'are', 'plenty', 'graphic', 'scenes', 'are', 'typical', 'movie', 'focus', 'plight', 'small', 'band', 'tenants', 'know', 'do', 'care', 'collective', 'fates', 'do', 'concern', 'emotional', 'resonance', 'suffering', 'are', 'moments', 'are', 'frightful', 'many', 'heart-wrenching', 'heartfelt', 'feeling', 'drama', 'placed', 'horror', 'setting', ""n't"", 'disappoint']",N/A
1119047,A3UA046AA3DXFD,B000YDOOEG,Sid the Elf,"[5, 5]","For the second year in a row we have been graced with the After Dark Horrofest. Well saying ""graced"" my be a bit overboard considering almost every film developed under this festival has been a disaster to sub par at best. We love the horror genre and encourage the whole indi film movement but there has to be some substence to what we're watching or why bother? Short on budget doesn't mean it has to suck. All it means is you have to rely less on killer effects and dish up a good story with some realistic chills. Mulbery Street actually succeeds in this way to an extent. Not so much scary but the concept definately has a chill factor. Who wouldn't get scared by being preyed upon by rat zombies in a tenament home?Our story takes place in a New York City tenament home where 6 seperate residents are dealing with the fact that their complex will be demolished due to an urban renewal. One great aspect of the film is the believability of these characters. It's not a bunch of young kids aimlessly running around getting picked off as in the typical horror flicks of today. It's actual real people living their everyday lives. The main character is a former boxer and his close friend who are awaiting the boxers daughters return from Iraq. Then there are a couple of guys who live on the upper floor, one being an elderly man who needs an oxygen tank to survive, and a single mother and her son. So you start to actually care for the characters instead of routing for them to vanish. As they all go about their day the super is trying to get the water to work in the boiler room. While working he's bitten on the arm by a rat. Within minutes he begins to have strange symptoms. He goes upstairs to rest and starts to see hair growing on his ears.The more time that goes by the worse he starts getting and it becomes obvious to everyone that something strange is going on. The news continues to report rat attacks throughout the city. Roughly every five minutes new breaking news appears stating the rat attacks are becoming so frequent they must suspend all subway service and want everyone to remain inside. What they don't know is that these rats are passing some strange virus around which are turning the infected into rat like zombie creatures. It's a lot like 28 Days Later but with a different storyline. From here on out you follow each tenant as they work together to save themselves from the rat zombies. It does become intense at times and overall is an enjoyable and creepy film. The use of atmosphere is key in this one. They really did a great job driving home the chills in that way. The camera lighting is very dim and you get a very claustrophobic feeling while inside the cramped apartments.Overall the film was good with some flaws. But why be so cridical on an independent film. Considering the small budget they did a great job. The focus on atmosphere was awesome and the acting was really good. A couple cool facts about Mulberry Street is how they had to shoot essential footage in the middle of the crowded streets of Manhattan without any official permission to film there, and how all the actors in this film are friends or in some way related to the director, so none of them received any payments. Not bad when you factor all that in. So if you're looking for a great film you won't find it in Mulberry Street. But if you go into it expecting an above average indi flick you will really like it. It's definately worth checking out.",3,"Rat zombies take control of NYC.

Not completely but just some of the features. This makes for a intresting take on the whole eating people thing. Instead of zombies you are rat-people.

The film does a nice job of developing the characters it introduces and luckily since the acting is above par compared to many of the other After Dark films, you actually somewhat care about the characters fate.The gore isn't anything to write home about, it's what you'd expect from a movie like this.  The majority of it are shots of the rat people feeding on dead corpses.  The movies saving grace is that it's pretty intense with some genuinely creepy scares and how oddly disturbing some of the creatures look.  I found their look to be more frightening than any zombie I've seen in a film (with the exception of the final scene of Rec).  Overall I'd have to recommend this movie to horror fans.

This film is more or less a horror movie, but it also explores other themes very effectively, which causes you to care for the characters much more than you normally would. Central themes include the idea of neighborhood and your place in it, as well as family and recovery from trauma.

1119052,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B000YDOOEG,Tim Janson,"[1, 5]","Last year's initial offerings of the After Dark Horrorfest films were surprisingly good.  There were no classics in the group but neither were there any real duds either (Although The Hamiton's came close).  The films were consistently well made considering the budget constraints they were under.  With that in mind, the anticipation for this year's films was quite high.  Unfortunately, things don't get off to a very strong start with Mulberry St., a ridiculous creature feature that is about fifty years too late.Most of the action takes place in a New York apartment building with a diverse group of tenants including former boxer Clutch, androgynous Coco, single mom Kay and her teenage son, and some assorted old coots.  For reasons which are never explained and barely even touched on, rats in the subway begin attacking and biting people.  We're never shown these attacks, we hear about them only through TV and radio news reports and thus, it's impossible to grasp just what kind of scale we are talking about.  Is it dozens of rats?  Hundreds?  Thousands?  This part of the city is locked down to try and contain the virus spread by the rats, a virus which turns the victim into, for lack of a better term, were-rats.Now if the virus had simply turned the people rabid and crazed with a taste for blood, it could have worked.  But no, the virus actually turns them into human rats with pointy ears and noses, long sharp teeth, and whiskers.  The make-up was so bad that the actors looked like rejects from the Broadway play of Cats.  It was unintentionally funny.  There is no logic to the plot.  What caused the rats to start attacking?  What caused people bitten to turn into rats?  And what was done to prevent further outbreaks?  All of these questions are left unanswered.The rat-people converge on the neighborhood including the apartment building, crawling between the walls and ceilings to attack the residents who think they are safe behind closed doors.  The performances weren't terrible and you have to laud the actors for at least going along with the awful plot and giving it their best.  Kim Blair manages to stand out as Clutch's daughter Casey, a solider returning home from the Middle East just as the outbreak begins.There's nothing terrifying in Mulberry St., and there's no suspense.  The rat-people were unconvincing as a threat, and the story is filled with crater-like divots.ExtrasMulberry St. does come with a number of extras should you really want to see them.""Behind the Scenes: The Rats"" featurette is a piece about the making of the film.There's also short bits on the film's make and FX, deleted scenes, and Outtakes.Tim Janson and Robert Trate will be bringing all 8 Films to Die For to Mania.

1119054,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B000YDOOEG,trebe,"[0, 0]","It may not be very polished, but Mulberry Street (2006) is an extremely effective little horror thriller, with true to life characters, and gritty mostly believable situations.  Shot with a limited budget, the production has a very intimate and cozy atmosphere, that adds to the believability.  Image quality suffers at times, and some of the shaky imagery is irritating, but the story is very effectively told, and barely gives you any reason to question the presentation.The story takes place in New York City, where something that turns people into flesh craving fiends, is being spread by rats.  The events unfold over the course of one day, and are centered on the activities of some of the residents of a condemned apartment building on Mulberry Street.  Nick Damici, who co-wrote the screenplay, plays Clutch, one of the residents.  He jogs in the neighborhood, works out on the roof of the building, and is expecting the arrival of his daughter Casey (Kim Blair) an ex-soldier injured while in the service.Bitten by a rat while doing repairs, Ross (Tim House) the building handyman, is one of the first of many victims.  Clutch's neighbor Kay (Bo Corre) follows the progress of the widespread outbreak, while tuned in to the TV news at the bar where she works.  The disease spreads fast, and the epidemic is soon out of control, with public transportation suspended, areas of the city quarantined, and people being attacked in the street.  The initial response from the government is slow, leaving the victims to fend for themselves.Clutch secures things at home, getting friends to lock themselves in their apartments, before heading out to check on Kay.  He manages to get Kay out of the bar, and while headed home, runs into his daughter who is driving a stolen truck.  Once Clutch gets back home, things focus on the attempts of the residents to keep the infected hordes at bay.  The diseased are dubbed ""rat bastards"", as over time the malady causes some to resemble rats.  They are relentless, and can move quite fast.Zombie tales seldom turn out well.  Miraculous solutions are quite rare, so the focus is usually more on the struggle to survive.  Mulberry Street may not feature actual zombies, but it follows a familiar pattern.  It's easy to buy most of what happens, as a core group bands together to survive.  The cast is very believable as working class folks, with authentic dialog that is only occasionally exaggerated.  The story unravels a little near the end, as the action ramps up to a frenzy, for a climactic finish.  There are some overdramatic elements, such as when old friends return to visit, but they are not stretched out gratuitously.Despite budgetary constraints, director Jim Mickle tells a gripping and frightening tale very well.  The special effects are limited, you don't even see a gun, but what is presented is quite effective.  The dark atmosphere and tight framing helps to draw you into the situation.  The writing is solid, and the cast does a great job with the material.  And there's no place with the mystique of New York City.  If you accept it for what it is, you may be pleasantly be surprised at how effective a thriller Mulberry Street is.",4,New Yorkers band together in another crisis...,1317427200,"10 1, 2011",2011,3196,"['may', 'not', 'be', 'very', 'polished', 'Mulberry', 'Street', '2006', 'extremely', 'effective', 'little', 'horror', 'thriller', 'true', 'life', 'characters', 'gritty', 'mostly', 'believable', 'situations', 'Shot', 'limited', 'budget', 'production', 'very', 'intimate', 'cozy', 'atmosphere', 'believability', 'Image', 'quality', 'suffers', 'times', 'shaky', 'imagery', 'irritating', 'story', 'very', 'effectively', 'told', 'barely', 'reason', 'question', 'presentation.The', 'story', 'place', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'where', 'something', 'people', 'flesh', 'craving', 'fiends', 'being', 'spread', 'rats', 'events', 'unfold', 'course', 'one', 'day', 'are', 'centered', 'activities', 'residents', 'condemned', 'apartment', 'building', 'Mulberry', 'Street', 'Nick', 'Damici', 'who', 'co-wrote', 'screenplay', 'Clutch', 'one', 'residents', 'neighborhood', 'out', 'roof', 'building', 'expecting', 'arrival', 'daughter', 'Casey', 'Kim', 'Blair', 'ex-soldier', 'injured', 'service.Bitten', 'rat', 'doing', 'repairs', 'Ross', 'Tim', 'House', 'building', 'handyman', 'one', 'first', 'many', 'victims', 'Clutch', 'neighbor', 'Kay', 'Bo', 'Corre', 'progress', 'widespread', 'outbreak', 'tuned', 'TV', 'news', 'bar', 'where', 'disease', 'fast', 'epidemic', 'soon', 'control', 'public', 'transportation', 'suspended', 'areas', 'city', 'quarantined', 'people', 'being', 'attacked', 'street', 'initial', 'response', 'government', 'slow', 'leaving', 'victims', 'fend', 'themselves.Clutch', 'secures', 'things', 'home', 'getting', 'friends', 'lock', 'apartments', 'heading', 'out', 'check', 'Kay', 'get', 'Kay', 'bar', 'headed', 'home', 'daughter', 'who', 'driving', 'stolen', 'truck', 'Once', 'Clutch', 'back', 'home', 'things', 'focus', 'attempts', 'residents', 'keep', 'infected', 'hordes', 'bay', 'diseased', 'are', 'dubbed', 'rat', 'bastards', 'time', 'malady', 'resemble', 'rats', 'are', 'relentless', 'can', 'move', 'quite', 'fast.Zombie', 'tales', 'seldom', 'turn', 'out', 'well', 'Miraculous', 'solutions', 'are', 'quite', 'rare', 'focus', 'usually', 'more', 'struggle', 'survive', 'Mulberry', 'Street', 'may', 'not', 'feature', 'actual', 'zombies', 'familiar', 'pattern', 'easy', 'buy', 'most', 'what', 'core', 'group', 'together', 'survive', 'cast', 'very', 'believable', 'working', 'class', 'folks', 'authentic', 'dialog', 'only', 'occasionally', 'exaggerated', 'story', 'little', 'end', 'action', 'up', 'frenzy', 'climactic', 'finish', 'are', 'overdramatic', 'elements', 'such', 'when', 'old', 'friends', 'return', 'visit', 'are', 'not', 'stretched', 'out', 'gratuitously.Despite', 'budgetary', 'constraints', 'director', 'Jim', 'Mickle', 'gripping', 'frightening', 'tale', 'very', 'well', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'limited', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'see', 'gun', 'what', 'presented', 'quite', 'effective', 'dark', 'atmosphere', 'tight', 'framing', 'draw', 'situation', 'writing', 'solid', 'cast', 'great', 'job', 'material', 'place', 'mystique', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'accept', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'pleasantly', 'be', 'surprised', 'how', 'effective', 'thriller', 'Mulberry', 'Street']",N/A

I just wanted to open up my review by saying that, mainly because it amuses me.Anyway, this DVD is part of 2007's '8 Films to Die For' series, and I've been quite excited about all of them, even though I was not fortunate enough to catch them in theatres this year. For those not in the know, they are eight indie horror flicks with a limited run pushed by After Dark Films. However, they also tend to be 'love it' or 'hate it' films. Myself, I fall into the former camp, and in general love horror movies. Even the bad ones are enjoyable to watch...This particular one was actually quite original. The long and the short of it... a plague of were-rats running amok in New York city. Like I said, its quite an original concept, which really got me excited. And it did a fun job capturing the atmosphere of urban New York. While it may not stand out as a masterpiece of cinema, it was a very enjoyable movie, which is all that really matters in my opinion. Its definately worth checking out for the horror buff, and it has enough gore to keep anyone happy. Plus rats... errr, rat-people at least. Also, scream queen Debbie Rochon makes a cameo as a reporter, for horror buffs like myself.As an added bonus, like the other 8 Films to Die For, comes with episodes of the 2007 'Search for Miss Horror Fest' contest. Not really relevant to the film in any meaningful way, but still fun to watch. Especially if you like reality TV meets half-naked Goth chick horror fans (and what red-blooded man wouldn't, I ask).So I definately recommend buying this DVD. I've been making my way through the other outings from 2007 pretty steadily, and have liked them all so far (and am eagerly awaiting Frontiers). But this one was especially enjoyable...
