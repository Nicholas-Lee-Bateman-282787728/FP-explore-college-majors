Jon Erik Hexum as he was starting to shoot the second season and Anthony Hamilton (his replacement) who died in 1986. They both acted well in this series alongside Jennifer O'Neill, but I really think Hexum was the superior actor.I think if Jon Erik Hexum had lived, the show would have lasted longer. I think in memory of him, this series should be released on DVD.

1162049,A1YQS7S1IE53SB,B001990LLO,Wendy C. Rigney,"[1, 1]","So the premise by today's TV standards - agents, one a former Special Forces agent; the other, a widow of a murdered agent and a photographer taking over his work posing as a model and the photographer to catch all sorts of nefarious bad guys - may seem a bit cheesy and hokey, and maybe it was. But it was also entertaining and a hell of a lot of fun. Not everything has to be dark and serious, and the '80s was the perfect decade for this show.Of course, there was the well-known tragedy of Jon-Erik Hexum losing his life after a joke with a prop gun on the set went horribly wrong, ending a career of potential much too soon, but his Mac Harper was both boyishly charming and was skillful enough to use his brawn and his brains when the going got rough. Mac's/JEH's replacement, Jack Striker, as played by Antony Hamilton, was also easy on the eyes and showed promise. Ironically, Mr. Hamilton would also die much too soon in 1995 at only 42.But if one simply concentrates on the eye candy and outlandish but interesting cases and the characters of Dani, Mac, and Jack, as well as Richard Anderson's Henry, their advisor, boss, and friend (no, not MacGuyver, that's Richard DEAN Anderson; the former is best known from ""Bionic Woman"" in the 1970s), it is easy to go back to when TV was about escapism and larger than life.I would love for this to get an official release if just to honor the work of the two late male leads (and Jennifer O'Neill and the aforementioned Richard Anderson, of course!). I realize the issue of music may be the reason it hasn't been released, but since both the title theme of ""Holding Out For A Hero"" was covered by E.G. Daly and not the original Bonnie Tyler recording - and the other '80s music was also covers with others singing - perhaps something could be worked out? I sincerely hope so. It would be a shame to just have this remain in a vault, collecting dust.A product of its time or not, this TV time capsule is still enjoyable, even if the events surrounding this series meant it would only last for one season. Please release this series to DVD.",5,"Not rocket science, but a lot of light '80s fun!",1364688000,"03 31, 2013",2013,2090,"['premise', 'today', 'TV', 'standards', 'agents', 'one', 'former', 'Special', 'Forces', 'agent', 'other', 'widow', 'murdered', 'agent', 'photographer', 'taking', 'work', 'posing', 'model', 'photographer', 'catch', 'sorts', 'nefarious', 'bad', 'guys', 'may', 'seem', 'bit', 'cheesy', 'hokey', 'maybe', 'was', 'was', 'also', 'entertaining', 'hell', 'lot', 'fun', 'Not', 'everything', 'be', 'dark', 'serious', ""'80s"", 'was', 'perfect', 'decade', 'show.Of', 'course', 'was', 'well-known', 'tragedy', 'Jon-Erik', 'Hexum', 'losing', 'life', 'joke', 'prop', 'gun', 'set', 'went', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'ending', 'career', 'potential', 'much', 'too', 'soon', 'Mac', 'Harper', 'was', 'boyishly', 'charming', 'was', 'skillful', 'enough', 'use', 'brawn', 'brains', 'when', 'going', 'got', 'rough', ""Mac's/JEH"", 'replacement', 'Jack', 'Striker', 'played', 'Antony', 'Hamilton', 'was', 'also', 'easy', 'eyes', 'showed', 'promise', 'Ironically', 'Mr.', 'Hamilton', 'would', 'also', 'die', 'much', 'too', 'soon', '1995', 'only', '42.But', 'one', 'simply', 'eye', 'candy', 'outlandish', 'interesting', 'cases', 'characters', 'Dani', 'Mac', 'Jack', 'as', 'well', 'Richard', 'Anderson', 'Henry', 'advisor', 'boss', 'friend', 'not', 'MacGuyver', 'Richard', 'DEAN', 'Anderson', 'former', 'best', 'known', 'Bionic', 'Woman', '1970s', 'easy', 'go', 'back', 'when', 'TV', 'was', 'escapism', 'larger', 'life.I', 'would', 'love', 'get', 'official', 'release', 'just', 'honor', 'work', 'two', 'late', 'male', 'leads', 'Jennifer', ""O'Neill"", 'aforementioned', 'Richard', 'Anderson', 'course', 'realize', 'issue', 'music', 'may', 'be', 'reason', ""n't"", 'been', 'released', 'title', 'theme', 'Holding', 'Out', 'Hero', 'was', 'covered', 'E.G', 'Daly', 'not', 'original', 'Bonnie', 'Tyler', 'recording', 'other', 'music', 'was', 'also', 'others', 'singing', 'perhaps', 'something', 'could', 'be', 'worked', 'out', 'sincerely', 'hope', 'so', 'would', 'be', 'shame', 'just', 'have', 'remain', 'vault', 'collecting', 'dust.A', 'product', 'time', 'not', 'TV', 'time', 'capsule', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'even', 'events', 'surrounding', 'series', 'meant', 'would', 'only', 'last', 'one', 'season', 'Please', 'release', 'series', 'DVD']",Cover Up 1984 TV Series
