326993,A2GOGRBACMDV3D,6302665175,"Adrian Sherlock ""Ade""","[14, 16]","The story is not as bizarre as fan reaction to it! We have everything from someone who assumes that Eric Saward, who wrote Colin Baker's best story, is to blame for this, to those who think it is total genius, and everything else in between! Sheesh!Amazing! How can I put this. This story is remarkable in that, which ever way you want to look at it, it is at least entertaining (then again, so was Plan Nine From Outer Space!)and Colin Baker, while pretty painful at times, is also very compelling and engaging a lot of the time. There is also a beautiful turn from the guest star Maurice Denham as Azmeal, a great, great actor who does wonders with the role.The script is fairly poor, but contains some outrageous and memorable dialog. The game plan, to make this Doctor seem evil and unlikeable and then redeem him gradually, seems ok in theory but the realisation, having him try to throttle Peri, is really off-putting and many think it hurt the show big time. Here I agree, I met teenagers who hated it and thought it sunk the whole series. The slug villain is pretty poor and the production has a tacky look, with a tasteless costume and garish titles at its heart, too detract further. But it is compelling viewing all the same. I cringe at the Doctor being so twisted in parts, but overall, this is contrived, tasteless but hypnotic viewing. Not a flawed classic, but a shonky pantomine with an utterly compelling black heart. It points to the series it was going to become before Michael Grade interefered, a black comedy of the darkest, most garish variety, realised brilliantly in later Bakers like Varos and Revelation. Initially, I loved the costume worn by Colin Baker, but grew tired of it later. But what an expression of individuality in the face of robotic sameness like Cybermen and Daleks. The last true Doctor is malajusted and over the fence, tasteless and annoying at times, but still has something edgey and interesting to offer. If nothing else, watching this will make you be thankful for the tasteful Peter Davison era!!! Overall, it's a bad story with redeeming qualities and is worth watching.

326994,A10XJR7CWHNKWU,6302665175,Alan Caylow,"[30, 33]","Poor Colin Baker, the Sixth Doctor. Over the years, it appears that Baker, a fine actor, and, as far as I'M concerned, a fine Doctor, has become the Rodney Dangerfield of Doctor Who's---he don't get no respect at all (or, at least, not very much). It seems that the Sixth Doctor is not looked back upon with too much fondness for several reasons: his aggressive behavior/bad temper, his very loud wardrobe, and the violent nature of some of his first-season episodes---""Vengeance On Varos"" taking place on a planet where people watch ""video nasties"" on television, ""Attack Of The Cybermen"" with a main character's hands being crushed by a Cyberman until they bleed (though NOT graphically, unless the sight of fake blood makes you faint), and ""Revelation Of The Daleks"" with it's various deaths. Throw in an 18-month hiatus dealt to the ""Doctor Who"" series during Baker's tenure, as well as continuously sagging ratings, and you've got yourself the only actor to ever actually have been *fired* from the role of everyone's favorite Timelord (shame on you Michael Grade, the BBC controller at the time). The BBC then had the audacity to try to get Baker to come back for a final regeneration story so they could ""properly"" bump off his Doctor---Baker responded by telling the BBC to shove it, and rightfully so. Who could blame him? And now I've just read in Doctor Who Magazine that a recent poll the magazine took has named Colin's debut story, ""The Twin Dilemma,"" the all-time worst Doctor Who story ever, ranking a bottom-of-the-barrel #200 out of 200 stories. With the imminent release of ""The Twin Dilemma"" on DVD, it's time for THIS Sixth Doctor fan to come to the defense. I'll try to be brief:I've always liked Colin Baker's Sixth Doctor. In fact, I rank him just behind Jon Pertwee as my all-time favorite Doctor (though Tom Baker, Patrick Troughton and David Tennant are also in my personal Top Five). After Peter Davison's quaint, passive Fifth Doctor (though he was good, especially in his classic finale, ""The Caves Of Androzani""), I greatly appreciated that the Sixth Doctor was a tough, take-no-prisoners Timelord. Despite his tetchyness, I still admire the Sixth Doctor for his intelligence, his bravery, and his wit. Had Baker been allowed to play the Doctor longer than a mere two seasons, I'm sure he would've grown in the part even more, and shown us sides to the Sixth Doctor that we hadn't seen yet. Alas, it was not to be, but you can't blame Colin for that. Yes, the Sixth Doctor had a temper---not too unlike William Hartnell's First Doctor, in fact---but he was still a GOOD guy, fighting on the side of GOOD. And don't tell me that the Sixth Doctor never showed Peri any kindness, because he most certainly did. Yes, his temper would briefly flare up every so often, but he would always calm down, and he showed time and time again that he cared about Peri. His friendship with her had certainly grown by the time the events of ""The Trial Of A Timelord"" happened, so he obviously liked her.  So there.His loud, colorful wardrobe....I liked it! The idea of producer John Nathan Turner was to give the Sixth Doctor a whirlpool costume to suit his whirlpool personality, and I think it worked quite well. I never liked the question marks on the Doctor's collar, but JNT started that with Tom Baker, so JNT has to take the blame for that.Finally, the violent nature of some of the Sixth Doctor's adventures....I LIKED that the ""Doctor Who"" series had gotten tougher with Colin Baker at the helm. It showed that the makers of ""Doctor Who"" were not afraid to take some risks with the series. However, I still maintain that Colin Baker's era was not, I repeat, NOT as graphic as many have been led to believe. I've seen far worse things on TV then a bloodied pair of hands, believe me.As for ""The Twin Dilemma"" itself, I don't believe for one single second that it's the turkey it's been made out to be. Okay, so it may not boast the greatest of scripts, and it may not be a terribly *exciting* story, but I still find the story very entertaining, the characters interesting, the look and feel of it quite handsome, and the performances of the cast excellent, with Colin Baker's fresh, colorful performance as the new Doctor at the center.Peter Davison, as good as he was, was at times a bit too soft. Davison also wasn't served well by his writers, who usually had his Fifth Doctor respond with ""I don't know"" virtually every time a companion asked him what they should do (and you know a Doctor is in serious trouble, writing-wise, when a companion seems to be more intelligent than he is---in Peter Davison's case, the snotty-nosed Nyssa). Colin Baker's Doctor was unashamedly aggressive, but so is James Bond, and you wouldn't want to mess with him, either. James Bond is still a good guy, fighting on our side. So is Colin Baker's Sixth Doctor. With ""The Twin Dilemma,"" Colin Baker showed that there was a totally new Doctor in town, and totally new in more ways than one. And I like him.",4,In Defense Of The Sixth Doctor,1256515200,"10 26, 2009",2009,5013,"['Poor', 'Colin', 'Baker', 'Sixth', 'Doctor', 'years', 'Baker', 'fine', 'actor', 'as', 'far', ""'M"", 'concerned',

Other Doctors have shouted at companions and have been angry with companions.  Companions are, after all, far younger than the Doctor's 700+ years, and they are under his protection.  It was a TERRIBLE idea to have the sixth Doctor attempt to kill a companion!  Regeneration is no excuse.  It was too much - it left a terrible impression of the 6th Doctor that never entirely went away.  I have no problem with making a change from the fifth Doctor - making the Doctor tetchy; fine.  But he has been a decent person, and, barring the earliest shows, he has been someone to admire.And then there is the clothes.  I can see a maladjusted mind selecting the hideous clothing.  But by the end of the show, or the beginning of the next, when he had (supposedly) settled down, he should have ditched the hideous clothing for something a bit more toned down.  Granted, the Doctor's clothes have been always been a little offbeat, but this was just too much.Colin Baker may be a wonderful actor, and perhaps there was a plan in place to get better over time, but it doesn't make up for the above.",2,Pu-lease!,1311897600,"07 29, 2011",2011,1393,"['introduction', 'sixth', 'Doctor', 'first', 'full', 'story', 'played', 'Colin', 'Baker.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'bad', 'wobbly', 'sets', 'poorly', 'made', 'up', 'monsters', 'such', 'would', 'hardly', 'be', 'unique', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'do', 'mind', 'terribly', 'havoc', 'wreaked', 'character', 'Doctor', 'Other', 'Doctors', 'have', 'shouted', 'companions', 'have', 'been', 'angry', 'companions', 'Companions', 'are', 'far', 'younger', 'Doctor', '700+', 'years', 'are', 'protection', 'was', 'TERRIBLE', 'idea', 'have', 'sixth', 'Doctor', 'attempt', 'kill', 'companion', 'Regeneration', 'excuse', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'left', 'terrible', 'impression', '6th', 'Doctor', 'never', 'entirely', 'went', 'away', 'have', 'problem', 'making', 'change', 'fifth', 'Doctor', 'making', 'Doctor', 'tetchy', 'fine', 'been', 'decent', 'person', 'barring', 'earliest', 'shows', 'been', 'someone', 'admire.And', 'then', 'clothes', 'can', 'see', 'maladjusted', 'mind', 'selecting', 'hideous', 'clothing', 'end', 'show', 'beginning', 'next', 'when', 'had', 'supposedly', 'settled', 'down', 'should', 'have', 'ditched', 'hideous', 'clothing', 'something', 'bit', 'more', 'toned', 'down', 'Granted', 'Doctor', 'clothes', 'have', 'been', 'always', 'been', 'little', 'offbeat', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'much.Colin', 'Baker', 'may', 'be', 'wonderful', 'actor', 'perhaps', 'was', 'plan', 'place', 'get', 'better', 'time', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'above']",Doctor Who: Twin Dilemma VHS
326996,A3AS6G2F9CDHV5,6302665175,Brian May,"[8, 11]","OK, I will come clean at the very beginning. In 1984 I was not enamored with Colin Baker as Doctor Who. But before all you sixth Doctor fans click that you find this review unhelpful, let me assure you all that in recent  years I have warmed to him and appreciate his portrayal much more. But that  does not alter the fact that his debut story is an absolute travesty.  &quot;The Twin Dilemma&quot; is a shockingly bad production, with  disgusting giant slugs, dreadful costumes (although the Doctor's character  justifies his atrocious get-up), irritating music and awful acting  (especially from the twins Romulus and Remus, who could go down as the most  annoying characters in the show's history). The character of the newly  regenerated Doctor is also questionable. True, Colin Baker's Doctor is  irascible and arrogant, geared to make him more of an anti-hero, but  attempting to strangle Peri goes beyond the bounds of what should be  acceptable in Doctor Who. Even William Hartnell's Doctor, who was the  ultimate anti-hero (placing his companions' lives in danger so he could  satisfy his curiosity), was never as violent. The strangling scene is an  indication of the downward spiral into bad taste and unpleasantness that  John Nathan-Turner saw fit to inflict upon the series. But I digress.  &quot;The Twin Dilemma&quot; has no redeeming features. It has all the  hallmarks of a story that should never have been made. It is hardly a tale  that should introduce a new Doctor.

326997,A9XKE4OE48BNK,6302665175,Byron,"[2, 4]","This was a real disappointment as the first story for a new Doctor (Sylvester McCoy got an equally bad regeneration story with Time and the Rani). It was even worse at the time since, instead of being the first story of a new season, it was the last story in what had been Peter Davison's final season and it directly followed the excellentDoctor Who: The Caves of Androzani (Story 136). It had some good ideas such as The Doctor's instability and the appearance of a fellow Timelord but it was all let down by horribly conceived and executed villains, the laughable new costume for Baker (which the producer, John Nathan-Turner, as he did with Davison, insisted be worn as an unchanging 'uniform') and the unbelievably whiny faux-American companion Peri. A mess from start to finish. This was a very bad start for the Colin Baker era from which the show never fully recovered. The contentious relationship between the Doctor and Peri got so mean-spirited on the Doctor's part that it was painful and grating to watch.However, Colin Baker's first full season still produced some entertaining shows, despite Peri and the costume.This, along with 'Timelash', ranks as the worst of the C. Baker tenure. If you are a first time Colin Baker viewer, avoid this one.

He also sinks down amid his wardrobe and wails of the &quot;grinding wheels of the universe and the crashing boredom of eternity&quot; before breaking down into mad laughter, and to top it all, he attacks Peri.  Seeing that in regenerating he has become &quot;unregenerate,&quot; he decides to become a hermit in order to cleanse himself and pilots the TARDIS to the moon of Titan III, where by chance his best teacher, Azmael, has kidnapped twins gifted with mathematical genius in order to procure them for his master Mestor.The Doctor and Peri also rescue Lieutenant Hugo Lang, space corps commander who was pursuing the twins along with his squad, of which he is the sole survivor.  After foiling an attempt to kill them by Noma, one of the two Jocondans assisting Azmael, they go to Joconda, once a beautiful forest world devastated by the attack of Gastropods, giant beings half human/half slug.The new Doctor seems keen on denouncing his previous self, saying that he had a &quot;feckless charm which wasn't me.&quot;  On an interesting note, when Peri calls him &quot;Doc,&quot; he brings up the memory of the First Doctor in &quot;The Five Doctors&quot;:  &quot;Kindly refrain from addressing me as Doc, Perpugilliam!&quot;  And his remark on becoming &quot;unregenerate&quot; forecasts the Valeyard in the Trial Of A Timelord season.The new Doctor's outfit fits his personality fine, and Peri's plaid blouse is not bad either--it's Hugo's shiny metallic shirt that fits the epithet &quot;yuck.&quot;  Heck, if I found an outfit like the Sixth Doctor's, I would &quot;go out like that.&quot;Colin Baker's verbal repartee is one of the reasons he was a successful Who actor, whether he is quoting from poets or rattling off words that silkily roll off his tongue:  &quot;I'm a knight errant, not an errant fool.&quot;  Or how about this alliterative verbal attack on his assistant:  &quot;Poor pusilanimous Peri!  What a pitiful performance!&quot;  Mentally wandering off is a &quot;mental stroll in the park of psychic tranquility.&quot;  It's easy to see why John Nathan-Turner picked Baker to succeed Peter Davison.His Doctor is very expressive, and unpleasantly arrogant, but beneath all that, beats two kind hearts, which is important in keeping in line with his personality.Mestor resembles a furry giant snail with a cross-eyed owl-like face.

You hardly rate at all.&quot;And Gavin and Andrew Conrad as the Sylvest twins give a good performance as being rational, cerebral, but vulnerable.  Remus tells his father:  &quot;Just because she gave birth to us, does that automatically grant her a place in our affections?&quot;  and that &quot;respect must be earned.&quot;  Those familiar with Roman mythology know the reference to Romulus and Remus.Not a bad debut story, although not as excellent as Spearhead From Space or Castrovalva.",4,Debut of the Multicoloured Action Man,1010102400,"01 4, 2002",2002,3207,"['Suffering', 'post-regenerative', 'trauma', 'worse', 'did', 'q.v', 'Castrovalva', 'new', 'outfit', 'patchwork', 'orange', 'overcoat', 'yellow', 'trousers', 'red', 'stripes', 'blue', 'cravat', 'white', 'polka', 'dots', 'also', 'down', 'wardrobe', 'wails', 'quot', 'grinding', 'wheels', 'universe', 'crashing', 'boredom', 'eternity', 'quot', 'breaking', 'down', 'mad', 'laughter', 'top', 'Peri', 'Seeing', 'regenerating', 'become', 'quot', 'unregenerate', 'quot', 'become', 'hermit', 'order', 'cleanse', 'pilots', 'TARDIS', 'moon', 'Titan', 'III', 'where', 'chance', 'best', 'teacher', 'Azmael', 'kidnapped', 'twins', 'gifted', 'mathematical', 'genius', 'order', 'procure', 'master', 'Mestor.The', 'Doctor', 'Peri', 'also', 'rescue', 'Lieutenant', 'Hugo', 'Lang', 'space', 'corps', 'commander', 'who', 'was', 'pursuing', 'twins', 'squad', 'sole', 'survivor', 'foiling', 'attempt', 'kill', 'Noma', 'one', 'two', 'Jocondans', 'assisting', 'Azmael', 'go', 'Joconda', 'once', 'beautiful', 'forest', 'world', 'devastated', 'attack', 'Gastropods', 'giant', 'beings', 'half', 'human/half', 'slug.The', 'new', 'Doctor', 'keen', 'denouncing', 'previous', 'self', 'saying', 'had', 'quot', 'charm', 'was', ""n't"", 'me.', 'quot', 'interesting', 'note', 'when', 'Peri', 'quot', 'Doc', 'quot', 'up', 'memory', 'First', 'Doctor', 'quot', 'Five', 'Doctors', 'quot', 'quot', 'Kindly', 'refrain', 'addressing', 'Doc', 'Perpugilliam', 'quot', 'remark', 'becoming', 'quot', 'unregenerate', 'quot', 'Valeyard', 'Trial', 'A', 'Timelord', 'new', 'Doctor', 'outfit', 'personality', 'fine', 'Peri', 'plaid', 'blouse', 'not', 'bad', 'Hugo', 'shiny', 'metallic', 'shirt', 'epithet', 'quot', 'quot', 'Heck', 'found', 'outfit', 'Sixth', 'Doctor', 'would', 'quot', 'go', 'out', 'that.', 'quot', 'Colin', 'Baker', 'verbal', 'repartee', 'one', 'reasons', 'was', 'successful', 'Who', 'actor', 'quoting', 'poets', 'rattling', 'off', 'words', 'silkily', 'roll', 'off', 'tongue', 'quot', ""'m"", 'knight', 'errant', 'not', 'errant', 'fool.', 'quot', 'how', 'alliterative', 'verbal', 'attack', 'assistant', 'quot', 'Poor', 'pusilanimous', 'Peri', 'What', 'pitiful', 'performance', 'quot', 'Mentally', 'wandering', 'off', 'quot', 'mental', 'stroll', 'park', 'psychic', 'tranquility.', 'quot', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'John', 'Nathan-Turner', 'picked', 'Baker', 'succeed', 'Peter', 'Davison.His', 'Doctor', 'very', 'expressive', 'unpleasantly', 'arrogant', 'two', 'kind', 'hearts', 'important', 'keeping', 'line', 'personality.Mestor', 'furry', 'giant', 'snail', 'cross-eyed', 'owl-like', 'face', 'tone', 'menacing', 'cross-eyes', 'make', 'laughable', 'Doctor', 'quot', 'time', ""'ve"", 'been', 'threatened', 'experts', 'hardly', 'rate', 'all.', 'quot', 'Gavin', 'Andrew', 'Conrad', 'Sylvest', 'give', 'good', 'performance', 'being', 'rational', 'cerebral', 'vulnerable', 'Remus', 'father', 'quot', 'Just', 'gave', 'birth', 'automatically', 'grant', 'place', 'affections', 'quot', 'quot', 'respect', 'must', 'be', 'earned.', 'quot', 'familiar', 'Roman', 'mythology', 'know', 'reference', 'Romulus', 'Remus.Not', 'bad', 'debut', 'story', 'not', 'as', 'excellent', 'Spearhead', 'Space', 'Castrovalva']",Doctor Who: Twin Dilemma VHS

Colin's portrayal is best, with Davison being #2.  It's refreshing  to note that the Doctor is not human.  But introducing a new lead character  at the very end of a season, especially with such a risky element, usually  brings trouble.That along with some horrible music, overblown comments  and actions by the Doctor, and all around bad writing, make this story  unpalatable.  Aside from Romulus and Remus (the twins, whose characters  were bad enough but then the acting...), the writing brings the show  down!However, by the time we near the end of part 2, things start to  shape up and the Doctor becomes himself again - crusader against evil.  Larger than life and boastful, yes, but that in itself isn't bad.Also  good was the relationship between the Doctor and Azmael - and that's  probably the only thing which keeps viewers intersted for it was those  scenes involving these two characters which felt natural and honest.

Sixth Doctors Haters; Here is your last chance to throw stones at the Colin Baker Era of the classic series and I am sure you have all been waiting to trash this episode in particular. As a fan of Colin Baker's performance (and there are far more of us than most Dr. Who fans will admit)I say to you from the bottom of my heart... YOU WILL NOT BE MISSED! Oh and by the way, Of the doctors with the fewest possible DVD releases (Troughton 8, C.Baker 8 and McCoy 12) who crossed the finish line first?The review: Breaking from the show's tradition The twin Dilemma did not open a new season but in fact closes 5th Doctor's Peter Davison's third season. It deals with the newly regenerated and remorseful doctor's wish to become a hermit following his post -regeneration tirade that finds the doctor trying to strangle his new companion Peri. Fortunatly she fights him off but this scene is disturbing to say the least. Of course the hermit thing does not work out as the Doctor's hide-a-way on the planet Titan 3 winds up to be the safe house for two genius, kidnapped, twin, earthing boys who are pawns in a plot by an alien slug named MESTOR. Mestor's plan is to use the twin's genius to cause the sun of the planet Jocanda to go super nova thus spreading millions of tiny Mestor eggs throughout the universe. Long story short The doctor ""scrambles' To ""poach"" the plot before it gets a chance to ""hatch"".The Twin Dilemma has some good moments. Colin Baker throws himself into the role with gusto setting his portrayal apart from the previous doctor from scene one. Their is an excellant supporting performance by aging actor Maurice Denham who plays fellow timelord and freind of the 4th doctor (or so we are told) Asmale Edgeworth. There is also a noteworhty and ""ARCHY"" performence by actor Seymour Green as the Chamberlain to Mestor. The episode itself is brightly light and full of color (costumes,sets,etc.). There is a quick pace to the story  as we jump from location to loacation as each episode ends: Earth-Tardis-Titan 3-Jocanda. Where the episode loses focus is in the performances of the remaining supporting cast. I would rather not metion names in case they goggle their own names but they know who they are. Then there is the main 'badie"" Mestor who is just plain awful from design to voice. In a season full of poorly designed monsters (season 21)Mestor is one of the worst...I would say second only to that silly four legged thing (Merker I think)from the season opener ""Warriors of the Deep. The Twin Dilemma story line itself lacks a certain plausibility even by Doctor Who standards. Last and certainly least are the bird-like Jocandians. All I can say here is, ""Oh Boy. Not good"".In summary I would say buy it if you are fans of the sixth Doctor or like regeneration episodes. Skip it if you do not like the sixth doctor (don't get me started again) or if you only buy the best of the classic series. As for me I have this episode on pre order and will have my carot juice chilled come 1-10-2010. Has anyone seen my orange spats?",3,Historically Significant? Yes. Significant?

Not only did the Doctor try to kill Peri in this one (although that was due to a regeneration crisis), but he's also cowardly, grumpy, and selfish in this one too. It's funny how John Nathan-Turner was so worried about fans not liking Peter Davison's Doctor when he actually should have been more concerned about Colin Baker's.

It was even more stupid to end a season with this story.Now this story does have some good elements in it.
