Heavyweight boxer Ken Norton, who won over Mohammed Ali (and broke his jaw) in 1973, made his impressive screen debut as Mede the Mandingo.This film is a mass of contradictions, which is probably what keeps one glued to the screen. It is manipulative yet unpredictable, gratuitous and raw but thought-provoking; some of it might be absurd, but many of the situations shown did happen.With all the brutality, nudity, incest, and most of all, the repellent language, this is not a film for the young, or anyone squeamish about violence.Total running time is 127 minutes.",4,hot Southern sleaze...but riveting,1088380800,"06 28, 2004",2004,1380,"['Part', 'Harold', 'Robbins', 'part', 'Euripedes', 'film', 'brutal', 'depictions', 'slavery', 'abhorrent', 'language', 'extraordinary', 'cinematography', 'Richard', 'Kline.The', 'imagery', 'Falconhurst', 'huge', 'decrepit', 'plantation', 'cruel', 'vicious', 'man', 'James', 'Mason', 'strange', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'fantastic', 'peeling', 'paint', 'filthy', 'mosquito', 'nets', 'winding', 'staircases', 'gleaming', 'wood', 'dark', 'steamy', 'rooms', 'lush', 'exteriors', 'drooping', 'wisteria.The', 'score', 'Maurice', 'Jarre', 'also', 'much', 'atmosphere', 'Muddy', 'Waters', 'singing', 'quot', 'Born', 'Time', 'quot', '.Perry', 'King', 'excellent', 'Mason', 'son', 'broken', 'body', 'weak', 'spirit', 'knowing', 'what', 'right', 'often', 'doing', 'what', 'wrong', 'wife', 'Susan', 'George', 'appropriately', 'annoying', 'trashy', 'quot', 'wench', 'quot', 'Brenda', 'Sykes', 'lovely', 'Heavyweight', 'boxer', 'Ken', 'Norton', 'who', 'won', 'over', 'Mohammed', 'Ali', 'broke', 'jaw', '1973', 'made', 'impressive', 'screen', 'debut', 'Mede', 'Mandingo.This', 'film', 'mass', 'contradictions', 'probably', 'what', 'one', 'glued', 'screen', 'manipulative', 'yet', 'unpredictable', 'gratuitous', 'raw', 'thought-provoking', 'might', 'be', 'absurd', 'many', 'situations', 'shown', 'did', 'happen.With', 'brutality', 'nudity', 'incest', 'most', 'repellent', 'language', 'not', 'film', 'young', 'anyone', 'squeamish', 'violence.Total', 'running', 'time', '127', 'minutes']",Mandingo VHS

222107,A72MWEBHCPMXZ,6300216632,"Ann Fenner ""catlady21""","[1, 1]","I think this film was made by a someone who really didn't have much idea of what plantation life was like in the real South. There is enough white trash southern acting and talking to satisfy the voyeuristic interests of those who are looking for that sort of thing. I just found it sad and lewd.Being from the South and also the direct descendant of plantation owners, I saw a lot that was wrong with this movie. I, of course, cannot say that such things did not happen. I will say that had they happened with frequency that such corruption and decadent behavior would have made the Civil War entirely unnecessary. The South would have crumbled under the weight of it's own evil and debauchery.My first complaint is the language of the film. I grew up among genteel southern folk who would never have spoken as the characters in this film were portrayed. If they were trying to portray southern white trash, then they certainly did. White trash did not occupy southern plantation houses at least not in the normal course of events.My second complaint is the way in which the character Hamilton disposed of his wife.  When he first learned that his wife was not a virgin, he would have taken her back to her family and the marriage annulled or left her in New Orleans to find her own way back.  On learning that she had been with a black man, he would have been within his rights to have shot her immediately, no questions asked.(in that time period.) Any well-bred Southern white man would know that, but obviously the author did not or he was aiming for a more prurient interest.I am not defending slavery, it was an abomination and it was evil. But what I DO know is that slaves were viewed as property no different than an expensive tractor. Most of the time very valuable property.  According to the film, Hamilton paid $7,000 for this slave. That would be comparable today to a $500,000 combine. No planter in his right mind is going to go out and take a tire iron to $500,000 combine because he's mad at his wife. It doesn't make economic sense. Planters were business men after all. They were out to make money and slaves were a part of that equation. Ok, so you say, Hamilton was really, really stupid. It could be, maybe, but very doubtful.The story had too many holes in it to be entertaining and the ending just too, too gross. Somebody needs to take that white trash author out behind the barn and take a hickory stick to his backside.",3,Mandingo,1380758400,"10 3, 2013",2013,2448,"['think', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'someone', 'who', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'idea', 'what', 'plantation', 'life', 'was', 'real', 'South', 'enough', 'white', 'trash', 'southern', 'acting', 'talking', 'satisfy', 'voyeuristic', 'interests', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'sort', 'thing', 'just', 'found', 'sad', 'lewd.Being', 'South', 'also', 'direct', 'descendant', 'plantation', 'owners', 'saw', 'lot', 'was', 'wrong', 'movie', 'course', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'such', 'things', 'did', 'not', 'happen', 'will', 'say', 'had', 'happened', 'frequency', 'such', 'corruption', 'decadent', 'behavior', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'Civil', 'War', 'entirely', 'unnecessary', 'South', 'would', 'have', 'crumbled', 'weight', 'own', 'evil', 'debauchery.My', 'first', 'complaint', 'language', 'film', 'grew', 'up', 'genteel', 'southern', 'folk', 'who', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'spoken', 'characters', 'film', 'were', 'portrayed', 'were', 'trying', 'portray', 'southern', 'white', 'trash', 'then', 'certainly', 'did', 'White', 'trash', 'did', 'not', 'occupy', 'southern', 'plantation', 'houses', 'least', 'not', 'normal', 'course', 'events.My', 'second', 'complaint', 'way', 'character', 'Hamilton', 'disposed', 'wife', 'When', 'first', 'learned', 'wife', 'was', 'not', 'virgin', 'would', 'have', 'taken', 'back', 'family', 'marriage', 'annulled', 'left', 'New', 'Orleans', 'find', 'own', 'way', 'back', 'learning', 'had', 'been', 'black', 'man', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'rights', 'have', 'shot', 'immediately', 'questions', 'asked', 'time', 'period', 'well-bred', 'Southern', 'white', 'man', 'would', 'know', 'obviously', 'author', 'did', 'not', 'was', 'aiming', 'more', 'prurient', 'interest.I', 'am', 'not', 'defending', 'slavery', 'was', 'abomination', 'was', 'evil', 'what', 'DO', 'know', 'slaves', 'were', 'viewed', 'property', 'different', 'expensive', 'tractor', 'Most', 'time', 'very', 'valuable', 'property', 'According', 'film', 'Hamilton', 'paid', '7,000', 'slave', 'would', 'be', 'comparable', 'today', '500,000', 'combine', 'planter', 'right', 'mind', 'going', 'go', 'out', 'take', 'tire', 'iron', '500,000', 'combine', 'mad', 'wife', ""n't"", 'make', 'economic', 'sense', 'Planters', 'were', 'business', 'men', 'were', 'out', 'make', 'money', 'slaves', 'were', 'part', 'equation', 'Ok', 'say', 'Hamilton', 'was', 'really', 'really', 'stupid', 'could', 'be', 'maybe', 'very', 'doubtful.The', 'story', 'had', 'too', 'many', 'holes', 'be', 'entertaining', 'ending', 'just', 'too', 'too', 'gross', 'Somebody', 'take', 'white', 'trash', 'author', 'barn', 'take', 'hickory', 'stick', 'backside']",Mandingo VHS

No foolish lies and southern romanticism like that piece of crap ""Gone With The Wind."" This movie shows how DEVILISH slave owners actually were and how they DEHUMANIZED African-Americans, while using them to spur their lavish lifestyles. It also delves into the MORAL DEPRAVITY of slavery (which is something that white Americans have long tried to distance themselves from). This movie pulls no punches as black slaves are used as SEX OBJECTS and must submit to their evil white master's (and mistress') debaucherous desires. This movie is EXTREMELY HISTORICALLY ACCURATE and deals with slavery in a very matter of fact manner. It is true that devilish, DEVIANT white slave owners (Thomas Jefferson for one) RAPED slaves and had INNUMERABLE offspring! We can't let this truth be forgotten! Furthermore, to get revenge on these white male SEXUAL PREDATORS, quite often their scorned white wives turned to the affections of WELL-ENDOWED black male slaves to even the score and to fulfill their carnal fantasies. Mandingo (hate it or love it) deals with these adult, and perhaps, taboo themes.

The bad news is that this movie is so far removed from present life for people of both colors that it's character and subject matter are not taught,learned or sought after today. This was an excellent period piece movie that could not even be made today because of political correctness. Instead of using the ""N-word"", can you imagine James Mason's character at the end calling the slave with the gun a stupid ""African American?"" This movie has character, depth, realism, while entertaining as much as any other major movie. I just saw this movie for the first time this year, 2009. All of the actors and actresses captured the fear, hatred, resentment, lust and ignorance as much as  slavery  could be captured on film. Ken Norton was excellent as Mede, not just another athlete ,with no acting skills(Hulk Hogan) thrown into a movie. He did a good job. Susan George evoked all kinds of emotions from every end of the spectrum, from the neglected wife, to slave abuser and baby killer to seducer of Mede to spoiled daughter, to victim of a racist husband , shamed by the fact that the first child of his wife is by a big, black, slave. Perry King did an excellent job and the son of rich plantation owner, played by James Mason's character. Just when the subject matter became secondary, and one might start to like King's character, since he is the most likable of the racist , violent slave owners in the movie, we are educated once again by the nature of slavery and the viciousness that defined the era.For all  who have an uneducated automatic reaction based solely on the word ""slavery"", I would recommend this movie. Or , if one just want to be entertained and educated by a movie unafraid to tell the truth,using graphic language, torture and sexual cohersion and violence of the day, this is the period piece movie for you.

There are some great actors and Boxer Ken Norton does a most plausible job in the title role. Hammond Maxwell(Perry King), at first,seems somewhat sympathetic to the plight of the slave, but then falls in line with all the other Slave Holders in using African American Women for their own sexual gratification. He gratifies his father's( James Mason) desire by obtaining a Mandingo(Ken Norton)at the slave market. Norton gets into a fight and is victorious over another slave. King immediately starts training Norton to fight. Norton fights a ""bloody"" match in which he is severly injured, but so what- he made a lot of money for King!James Mason, demanding an heir has encourged his son to marry a nearby Plantion Owners daughter. The daughter(Susan George) portends to be the proper virgin, but actually has been in an incestious relationship with her brother. To further complicate things, King has had a pleasureable sexual relationship with one of his future father in law's slaves. King purchases this slave to take home. King both takes the slave home and marries the daughter.Finding out about both the lack of virginity and the incestious relationship, King neglects his new wife and continues to see the slave lady. George, seeking revenge, turns her attentions to Norton. The plot thickens!Origionally slated to be presented in four parts, producer De Laurentis followed up with Drum.

222118,A35FC3DWA1M79H,6300216632,Christopher,"[6, 15]","I like 70's blaxploitation films (most of them)and I had not seen Mandingo.  I bought this on a blind buy from elsewhere at a can't miss price!First, this film is really soft porn.  Most people spend their time without clothes on and that includes little kids!  I noticed the woman (Vickie?) from All My Children in here and as I suspected, her body is looking right!  One woman who looks like Angela Bassett looked good, but was thin.  You see full frontal nudity in this film including a penis! Boy, who knew that you had to whore yourself out for acting roles?Anyway, this film is of course about slavery and the main white character loves having sex with black women and is not really attracted to white women.  In this film and maybe in that era in Louisiana, men seemed to only want to have sex with virgins.  I can't say that I have, so a virgin does not get me excited.  Obviously the blacks are slaves and the whites (even foreign ones of German and French persuasion) are slave owners.The one thing that I have noticed in this film which rings true for today is, that the blacks cannot make a move or think for themselves as the white must always suggest what they should think or do.  If a slave was told to clean the yard and he was heading toward a rake, the white man would tell him to get a rake to clean the yard.  I am sure that many blacks today know that feeling.  If you are in a university or on the job, before you can DO and you already know what to do, the white is suggesting to you what you should do as if you cannot think for yourself. When I saw these actions in Mandingo, I thought that the master/slave relationship still exists, at least in the minds of whites.  You see where ever you go, whites always love to tell blacks what to do or how to do it.  It is one of the reasons whites are made quarterbacks in the NFL and why blacks were mainly barred from that position for the longest time.  They need the white man to direct the black man and not for the black man to direct the white man.  It is a mental game.  This is why Michael Vick caught so much hell for the over some dogs, but Ben Rotheleissberger just got suspended.Another master/slave paradigm in Mandingo is the forcing the slaves to fight each other so that the white man collects the money, but the black man is the one damaged.  They taught the slaves to kill each other, but not their masters.  Sound familiar?  Yes, it is the same as boxing!  The only difference is, the boxers get paid NOW, but since many of them are dimwits, they end up broke and the white man took ALL of the money again.  This is why they say that education is the key to freedom.  This was realistic and relates to today's world.All in all, this film was pretty realistic even though I am sure that real slavery was worse.  Unlike other films about the black plight where whites - or some whites, end up looking like the savior, all whites showed that they were on the same team in the end!  The guy who liked the black slave women still treated them like slaves and made them work.  He even told them that they were slaves even when they started to get too close. This film successfully showed the slave who's education level was very low and the only thing that he knew was being a slave and to serve.  This is why they did not want slaves to read.  Once slaves got educated and could read, then they could where they came from, who they were and how they ended up in the predicament.  A good, obedient slaves was the dumb one raised to serve and not think about why only he and other blacks are doing all of the work!  It's kind of like blacks in customer service jobs, whether it is at a fast food place (illegals took over those jobs) or retail, blacks make up the bulk of the labor and whites make up the bulk of the management.  In other words, blacks get stuck making chump change while whites make the only decent money that can be made in retail - management money.  The only thing that has changed from slave times to now is that blacks are not called slaves and they think that they are free because they get a pay check instead of a whip!  When you look a minimum wage and how much companies make in a week, blacks are still slaves.Now, as for the Blu Ray quality, it is not in surround sound, but the sound was clear and appeared to be taken from an original source.  The picture quality during the opening credits were like ""Every Which Way but Loose,"" but then turned into a presentable BD.  For the most part it was sharp and somewhat clean, but I could not help but feeling as if they had not remastered it, but simply gave it a transfer.  The best part is, it is not bad, but I was left thinking that it could have been better.  There is low noise in the picture.  Colors are not vibrant but the credits were.  Overall, it is not a bad picture quality and if this is as good as it can get, then it is not bad.  The cover just sucks.I would recommend this picture to anyone wanted an idea of the torture, exploitation and frustrations of slavery was like.  This was no one-time holocaust from another people in another land, this was 400 plus 100+ years of slavery, segregation, discrimination, exploitation, abuse,domestic TERRORISM and humiliation in this land, by these people, AND - the very people who love to tell the world about a holocaust that was short without long-lasting effects, but they were some of the main ones involved in the black exploitation during slave times and of course until now.  Just look at the producers and or director of most blaxploitation films and get back to me!  My favorite line in the film is when the guy is about to get lynched and he says: ""After you lynch me, you can kiss my a**!""  Lol!  That sums it all up.",4,Pretty Interesting and a little more realistic than others.,1287014400,"10 14, 2010",2010,5748,"['like', '70', 'blaxploitation', 'films', 'most', 'had', 'not', 'seen',

That was a question asked in the movie ""Caligula"".  What would you do if you had the power of life and death? I believe the question to be relevant here as well.Basically, this movie is about black slaves getting caught up in the games that the white slave owners are playing amongst themselves.  More often than not, the slaves end up victims and their lot in life follow the fortunes (and misfortunes) of their masters.  The story takes place in the South, on a plantation owned by Warren Maxwell.The distinguished actor, James Mason, plays Warren Maxwell.  A young Perry King plays his son, Hammond.  British actress Susan George plays Blanche.  And boxer Ken Norton plays the role of Mede, the Mandingo.Getting on in years, Maxwell wants his only son (Hammond) to provide him a grandson so they can keep the family line going as well as to have someone in line to inherit the plantation.  The younger Maxwell goes to town and picks up a woman to be his wife.  The audience knows right away that the woman, Blanche, is just trouble waiting to happen.  Hammond and Blanche agree to marry.  On their first bedding, Hammond realizes that Blanche is not a virgin.  Blanche throws a tantrum and insists that she was until that night.  While in town, Hammond also purchases a couple of slaves.  A woman ""bed wench"" and a muscular male slave called Mede.  Eventually, he takes them all back to his father's plantation.Hammond and Mede develop a fondness for one another.  Meanwhile, Blanche has taken to the bottle and spends most of her days in a drunken stupor.  Hammond trains Mede for the fighting ring.  In return, Mede shows his loyalty by giving it all he has in the fighting ring for his master Hammond.  The elderly Hammond spends his days trying to transfer the pain of his gout and his arthritis to his house boy.  Meanwhile, Hammond avoids his wife and instead beds his black women, leaving Blanche unfulfilled.  Now, as you can see, this is a recipe for trouble.  And trouble does indeed come to the plantation.This is a good movie.  It was made during the middle of the 1970s, when blaxploitation was a very popular film genre.

Denial of cruelty could not stand up to this scathing portrayal of the institution of Slavery in Antebellum South as contained in this film!  Most reactions in the white world at the time the film was released and after for many years; focused on the sexuality vividly shown,  and completely missed the point.  This is a brilliant and incisive film and highlights many of the reasons that Slavery had to be abolished and even Lincoln's own party didn't support his abhorrence to it!  Lincoln learned, seeing it up close and personal, as a boy;  his repugnance to it  in Kentucky.  The movie &#34;Lincoln&#34; proves that opposition to the idea of slavery was not overwhelming and the 13th Amendment abolishing the legal position of it only passed by two votes in the House after languishing there for a whole year after it passed the Senate.  Further, eight or nine gutless wonders in the House abstained on the final vote.  One was from OHIO and that proves what I have learned about the State, since moving here 14 years ago!  OH is just a much in favor of treating Black Men and Women as chattel and is not the glorious keeper of the flames of freedom like they like to portray themselves.  Prejudice and Discrimination still exist in the North and are more pernicious and disguised than now exists in many Southern States.

(-:The subject of slavery itself is unbelievable enough, and that white people of meansin the antebellum south deemed/justified it as god's natural order for over 300 yrsis mind-boggling, but yes, it exsisted, and untold atrocities rivaling or perhaps eveneclipsing those of WW2 Nazi Germany abounded during this time! (It was just never chronicled!)This film was the first to address it from the sexual dynamics;The handsome, lustful and virile slavemaster's son, played wonderfullyby the absolutely gorgeous (when he was young!) Perry King, who is so spoiledon having his pleasure with the most desirable of the black female slaves thathe & his father owns, that he doesn't desire nor know how to even relate to a white woman,who the antebellum man placed on such a high & patronizing moral pedestal that the idea ofher being a sexual being was considered almost a sacrilage!So it was deemed as a rite of passage for white fathers and sons of that timeto explore all of their most depraved, animalistic, strident and hedonistic flightsof the white male sexual imagination with their black slave women on a regular basis!This was expected, accepted and not frowned upon by ""polite"" white society(male or female) of that time, so they indulged themselves freely while keeping up appearancesand having their white wives and children, cultivating wealth, and maintaining the warped socialorder of the pre-civil war south.Perry King's character, Hammond, has a special predilection for the virginslave women who had yet to feel the passion of another man's embrace,so that he could properly ""break them in"" to his liking!There is an almost ritualistic approach to this practice and he has a sense ofentitlement about it, while of course, the black slave women have no say in the matter.He is a very contridictory character...one who embodies the times he lives in perfectly.He has unusual compassion and tolerance for his slaves, yet exacts brutal reprimand on themwhen they fall outside of lines of the strict white supremist master/slave social order!He beds black women every night, yet refrains from kissing, caressing, showing real affectionfor them, only ""utilizing them"" for his pleasure...because to show affection with them in bedis to consider their humanity, and that would fly in the face of all of the warped doublestandard-laden idiotic backwards logic of his times! He makes ONE exception though, later in the film.There is so much contridiction, chicainery (an old word from that time, that meanttrickery, double-dealing, etc.), racial taboos, sexuality, brutality, etc., in thisvery unique film, that it amazes me that it got past the censors of that time!Even though it was the mid 70's & in the middle of the sexual revolution, this was rad stuff!Without going scene by scene and giving away the movie for people who have yet to see it,it just suffices to say that this is not the typical slavery era drama in the traditionof ROOTS, QUEEN, THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF MISS JANE PITTMAN, etc.!!--This goes much deeperand shows a much more realistic & seedier side of slavery and the antebellumsouthern social morays that many may find offensive to their modern PC sensibilities!But this film was very well done for it's time, had a great cast of credible actors,the production and direction of Dino De Laurentis and others, as well as being well written.There is much more going on here than a white slave owner who buys a prizedmandingo fighting stud (played by pro boxer Ken Norton) to breed with his bestfemale slaves like cattle, to produce a stable of super-stud fighting slaves whichhe plans to sell and exploit like fighting chickens...there are the dynamics of interraciallove & sex, the explosion of the myth of the prystine lilly white princess (played by Susan George)with no sense of her own sexuality, incest issues, and horrible racial folkloric beliefsthat have to be seen to believed!--The father of Perry King's character is played by veteran actor,the late James Mason, who is a downright despicable racist who does/ says some terrible thingsin this film, but like I said before, that's how it was then and what alot of whites believed!You can't look at it through 2009 sensibilities, you have to go back there to the 1830's.I first saw this movie for myself on cable late one night when I was in my teens,then I never saw or heard of it again until it was released to DVD in 2008.This is still an amazing piece of film history that packs a punch and pushesbuttons of racial/sexual/social dynamics which are still struggled with today!Everybody who I have shown this movie to has been moved in every kind of way,on every level you can imagine!-- Check it out for sure!",5,"Harsh Realities, Warped Logic, Sexual Subjugation &

Not since ""Planet of the Apes"" have I seen a movie where humans are treated worse than animals; they are brutalized, degraded, and murdered because their skin color is different.Since the beginning of time, humans have been enslaved by other humans.  This occurred often in war when the vanquished were forced into slavery by their conquerors.  However, America was not at war with Africa.  Slavery was committed for greed and lust.I've seen countless movies about vampire families, but none of these families were as perverted, cruel and twisted as the Maxwells of Falconhurst Plantation.  Slaves are bred like cattle - their babies are separated from them and sold like puppies; they are forced to fight like dogs and roosters and they are forced to have sex with their owners; and they are denied education.  Worst of all, they are not allowed to read the Bible; their owners fear that they might discover that they have souls and begin believing they are just as good as white people.In ""The Color Purple,"" Celie (Whoopie Goldberg)is a brutalized young black woman.  In ""Mandingo,"" we have Meade (heavy weight boxer Ken Norton) who is victimized by the society in which he is unfortunate to live.  His sexually depraved master, Hammond Maxwell (Perry King), can not be faithful to his wife and is constantly sleeping with his slaves.  Maxwell has always dreamed of owning a Mandingo; he buys Mede and trains him to be a fighter.  Mede must fight other slaves to the death or be killed himself.  He must mate with his sister, Big Pearl, or die.  He must make love to his master's alcoholic wife Blanche (Susan George) or die.  Poor Mede doesn't have much of a choice about anything.  I guess that is what it means to be enslaved.Mede is trapped in a bizarre world, more bizarre and dangerous than that of ""The Planet of the Apes,"" ""Logan's Run,"" or ""Soylent Green.""  A world in which Mede has no hope.  Tragedy will prevent him from seeing a future in which slavery has ended.""Mandingo"" is highly recommended for fans of action adventure and passionate drama.",4,"In ""Mandingo,"" Humans Are Treated Like Animals",1219363200,"08 22, 2008",2008,2184,"['am', 'huge', 'fan', 'science', 'fiction', 'horror', 'However', 'nothing', 'prepared', 'treachery', 'sorrow', 'Mandingo', 'Not', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'where', 'humans', 'are', 'treated', 'worse', 'animals', 'are', 'brutalized', 'degraded', 'murdered', 'skin', 'color', 'beginning', 'time', 'humans', 'have', 'been', 'enslaved', 'other', 'humans', 'occurred', 'often', 'war', 'when', 'vanquished', 'were', 'forced', 'slavery', 'conquerors', 'However', 'America', 'was', 'not', 'war', 'Africa', 'Slavery', 'was', 'committed', 'greed', 'lust.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'countless', 'movies', 'vampire', 'families', 'none', 'families', 'were', 'perverted', 'cruel', 'twisted', 'Maxwells', 'Falconhurst', 'Plantation', 'Slaves', 'are', 'bred', 'cattle', 'babies', 'are', 'separated', 'sold', 'puppies', 'are', 'forced', 'fight', 'dogs', 'roosters', 'are', 'forced', 'have', 'sex', 'owners', 'are', 'denied', 'education', 'Worst', 'are', 'not', 'allowed', 'read', 'Bible', 'owners', 'fear', 'might', 'discover', 'have', 'souls', 'begin', 'believing', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'white', 'people.In', 'Color', 'Purple', 'Celie', 'Whoopie', 'Goldberg', 'brutalized', 'young', 'black', 'woman', 'Mandingo', 'have', 'Meade', 'heavy', 'weight', 'boxer', 'Ken', 'Norton', 'who', 'victimized', 'society', 'unfortunate', 'live', 'sexually', 'depraved', 'master', 'Hammond', 'Maxwell', 'Perry', 'King', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'faithful', 'wife', 'constantly', 'sleeping', 'slaves', 'Maxwell', 'always', 'dreamed', 'owning', 'Mandingo', 'Mede', 'be', 'fighter', 'Mede', 'must', 'fight', 'other', 'slaves', 'death', 'be', 'killed', 'must', 'mate', 'sister', 'Big', 'Pearl', 'die', 'must', 'make', 'love', 'master', 'alcoholic', 'wife', 'Blanche', 'Susan', 'George', 'die', 'Poor', 'Mede', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'choice', 'anything', 'guess', 'what', 'be', 'enslaved.Mede', 'trapped', 'bizarre', 'world', 'more', 'bizarre', 'dangerous', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'Logan', 'Run', 'Soylent', 'Green', 'world', 'Mede', 'hope', 'Tragedy', 'will', 'prevent', 'seeing', 'future', 'slavery', 'ended', 'Mandingo', 'highly', 'recommended', 'fans', 'action', 'adventure', 'passionate', 'drama']",Mandingo VHS

Back in the day some white folks kept black folks as slaves in the south. All the white folks was bad and mean, sometimes even to other white folks. Most of that foolish white meanness was over women. You'd be mad too if you had to go around dressing like Colonel Sanders and the only air conditioning you had was the kind they have in this movie. Black kids fanning you with huge feathers while you're eating at the dinner table and speakin' like you ain't had nary a lot of schoolin'.Back in these slavery days it was really a taboo thing for white women to be having black men as boyfriends and having their babies. Just like in 1975 when the movie was first shown in the theaters.For some reason, this ain't a joke now, an old white man places his old wrinkled up white feets on nekkid black boy's tummy because that's supposed to make them feets feel better. Some southern doctor told him a black boy's tummy was as good as a Mexican's to make your feets feel better! I ain't lyin' now. Hush up and get a copy of this movie.Mandingo was the title of a book that they based this movie on. There is no sense in reading the book since it is now in video form. Mandingo is a high priced slave that the white women want. The Mandingo is played in the movie by Ken Norton. He's a real life boxer that beat Muhammad Ali and his son played in the NFL.Ken Norton is great in this movie. He has one of the best movie fight scenes I've ever seen with a former wrestler named Earl Maynard. So you've got two legit tough guys going at it and they are making it look legit with biting and blood! The deal was, slave owners are fighting their slaves and betting on them. Fight scenes are better when using real athletes as actors.Although he's doesn't say much and was actually made fun of in an early Mandingo SNL skit starring O.J. Simpson you should come away with a new found acting respect for Ken Norton. He's not an actor in the classic sense and he might not have even make the grade school play cut but this role was his.""Roots"" is a great T.V. mini-series to watch. This ain't Roots at all.Then end of this movie is very intense.

222145,A1NGWU5RWYVKUL,6300216632,J. Lewis,"[2, 2]","This movie, based on the pulp fiction ante-bellum novels of Lance Horner, is a unique variation on the blaxploitation flims of the 1970s. Its depiction of slavery, complete with whippings and sexual exploitation, are de rigeur plays to the ""black rage"" of that genre, with more than a little sexual titillation thrown into their depiction. The appearance of some reputable actors here, fairly good production values and Ken Norton's embodiment of a powerfully virile black manhood  makes this particular expression of that genre a cut above most blaxploitation films of the time. There is also a fair amount of nudity, including unsimulated scenes in which Norton and lead actor Perry King are visibly aroused while being fondled through their clothes by women. Or loin-cloth in the case of Norton.This movie expressed a unique moment in American film-making when mainstream movies in the 70s (this one is from Warner Brothers) were sexually and socially more daring. This was partly a legacy of the 1960s, but largely because of the growing influence of porn films. The impact of an exploding porn film industry made depiction of nudity and sexual themes, including fetishes like whippings,  much rawer and unmediated than anything before or now in mainstream cinema. This film version of ""Mandingo"" is a good documentation of that moment.Those interested in this film should be warned that there are some censored versions being sold, in keeping with our own times in which plenty of nudity, sex and violence is fine, so long as its scripted, air-brushed and simulated in just the right ways.

But while what most of what the characters get into personally is nonsense, the historical aspect of the film is, unfortunately, all too true. In fact, the film glosses over a lot of it. Buy and read the book by Kyle Onstott, who, before the genre became a moneymaker wrote the book based largely on historical readings, not his imagination.

(Much as the Nazis' ""Final Solution"" would do a century later, only with more systematic efficiency, and with global repercussions.)And this is to be regarded as a fitting subject for MIRTH? Well, perhaps if you lack a modicum of compassion, or even a rudimentary frame of reference with regard to black history. Admit it -- if this film had been about the Holocaust and had depicted the torture and gassing of Jews instead of the beating and lynching of slaves you would NOT have laughed, would you? At least I HOPE you wouldn't!Face it, this is a particular chapter of history that is simply too close to home and too uncomfortable for many white Americans (which I, also, with some degree of shame, admit to being) to fully acknowledge, much less stomach. Damn right this film is inflammatory, politically incorrect, offensive and salacious. It HAD to be if was to pretend to any level of accuracy with regard to even a semi-objective portrayal of slavery. And my particular star-rating has more to do with the films' refreshingly crude and repugnant portrayal of slavery rather than as an assessment of the film as a particular work of cinematic art.Yes, I found a number of things to quibble with in 'Mandingo', both in terms of certain stylistic and technical details, as well as some of the  writing and acting, though there is much to be admired there as well. But those aspects are really beside my point.Basically, 'Mandingo' is what it is, admire it or loathe it. 'Song Of The South' or 'Gone With The Wind' it definitely ain't. But you can seek out those films too, if you're craving a cozier cinematic version of the pre and Civil-War-Era South to soothe your sensitive consciences.Or, perhaps, in addition to 'Mandingo', you might consider seeing 'The Autobiography Of Miss Jane Pittman', 'Roots', 'Amistad', 'Beloved' or 'Manderlay'.

It certainly shows plenty of skin and the sex scenes are rather explicit, but based on my personal memory, it is a fairly faithful rendering of the novel by Kyle Onstott. And the nudity and sex are not as gratuitous as in most exploitation films of the 70s. That is because this film is intended to show black slavery in the Antebellum South in all its sordid depravity. It certainly does that quite well! As much as a third of the indigenous Mandinka people of West Africa (called Mandingo in the South) were enslaved through capture in war and shipped to the Americas. They were highly sought after by slave owners for their strength and stamina...and some were used in gaming as fighters as shown in this film. While the film was big-budget, the only A-list actor featured is James Mason and he was nearing the end of a long and distinguished career. Mason plays the patriarch of a slave-breeding plantation family in Louisiana...probably the worst sort of plantation where slaves were bred like cattle and the slave owners were active participants in the breeding.

If you don't take it  seriously, you can have loads of fun and laughs watching this one. Snortin'  Norton does a great job as Meade the Mandingo fighting buck. Ol' Jimbo  Mason is superb as the aging hard-line plantation owner who is very strict  and true to the old traditional ways. His son Perry King is a much kinder  and gentler soul without a cruel streak in him like the other characters.  Susan George is great as the sly conniving Southern Belle who is not as  innocent as she seems. Ol' Mr. Bentley from the Jeffersons - Paul Benedict  plays a fine sub-role as Mr. Brambley the slave trader. All in all, let the  liberals cry and whine.

222209,ACM90BRKX73OG,6300216632,Tom,"[0, 0]","Mandingo (1975) was directed by Richard Fleischer for Paramount Pictures.In 1840s Louisiana, spoiled squire, Hammond Maxwell (Perry King), is happy to just canoodle 24/7 with his father's young female slaves but widower Warren Maxwell (James Mason) wants his son to marry and start rebuilding Falconhurst, their dilapidated plantation. Hammond ventures to New Orleans to marry a cousin but along the way purchases a lovely female slave, Ellen (Brenda Sykes), and Mede (Ken Norton), a muscular Mandingo slave, with hopes of turning him into a prizefighter. On his wedding night, Hammond discovers his bride, Blanche (Susan George), is not a virgin and henceforth directs all of his affection towards Ellen. Mede becomes the toast of the plantation after he wins a vicious, no-holds bout. Jealous of Ellen and desperate for some canoodling herself, Blanche orders Mede to satisfy her sexual needs. Blanche becomes pregnant and when the mixed-race infant is born all hell breaks out at Falconhurst. Hammond had been (very) slightly sympathetic to the slaves' condition until he learns he has been cuckolded by Mede.This Southern-gothic look at American slavery condenses the very worst prejudices and behaviors of slaveholders into the film's two hours. Many have called Mandingo exploitative but no one should expect subtlety in a Dino De Laurentiis production. The scene where Hammond drops to his knees beside his bed to say his evening prayers over an awaiting young female slave, Dite (19-year-old Debbi Morgan in her second credited role), while the camera lingers salaciously over her nude body virtually defines exploitation. We get it, Fleischer. Slave owners were blazing hypocrites. But in scenes like this one and others the director seems to think he must rub the audience's face in it. The bottom line is any fictional reenactment of slavery can't come close to depicting the actual misery and terror inflicted on human beings. Outside of the sex and violence this film has an ""ABC Movie of the Week"" feel to it with a subpar script by eccentric screenwriter, Norman Wexler, and some especially unconvincing acting from famous boxer, Ken Norton, whose blank-faced, non-emotive portrayal is as stiff as a two-by-four. In addition, Mason's exaggerated Southern drawl is barely understandable. Lovely Susan George gives it her best shot as the frustrated, whiny, heavy-drinking Blanche.While this film suggests slaves from the West African Mandinka tribe were somewhat rare, they were actually well-represented in the slave population. Film director Quentin Tarantino admitted he drew quite a bit of inspiration for his Django In Chains from Mandingo, which he has cited as one of his favorite movies. However, historians state that the Mandinka death matches featured in both films are a myth.Mandingo was filmed mainly in Geismar, Lousiana where the historic Ashland-Belle Helene plantation served as the setting for Falconhurst.
