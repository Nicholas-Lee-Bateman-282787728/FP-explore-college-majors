I had seen the movie when it first came out in 1997 and had enjoyed it.  To tell the truth I was expecting it to be dated and was quite happy that it wasn't, (except for the size of the cell phone).Both Mel Gibson and Julia Roberts played their parts to a tee.  Mel as a compulsive man who has problems with his memory and sees conspiracies everywhere.  Julia as a prosecutor who just can't say no to the crazy man.  Both are haunted by the past and together they .....well that leads to spoilers.  And of course I must mention it is fun to see Patrick Stewart as the villain.As for the quality of the disk, it did drag in a couple of places, but not fatally and we didn't miss any portion of the movie.I think this stands up to time.For a spy thriller action movie, it hit the spot.I recommend this movie.",4,Thriller That Stands Up To Time,1376179200,"08 11, 2013",2013,870,"['decided', 'have', 'family', 'movie', 'night', 'was', 'pick', 'had', 'seen', 'movie', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', '1997', 'had', 'enjoyed', 'tell', 'truth', 'was', 'expecting', 'be', 'dated', 'was', 'quite', 'happy', 'was', ""n't"", 'size', 'cell', 'phone', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'played', 'parts', 'tee', 'Mel', 'compulsive', 'man', 'who', 'problems', 'memory', 'conspiracies', 'everywhere', 'Julia', 'prosecutor', 'who', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'no', 'crazy', 'man', 'are', 'haunted', 'past', 'together', '..well', 'spoilers', 'course', 'must', 'mention', 'fun', 'see', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'villain.As', 'quality', 'disk', 'did', 'drag', 'couple', 'places', 'not', 'fatally', 'did', ""n't"", 'miss', 'portion', 'movie.I', 'think', 'up', 'time.For', 'spy', 'thriller', 'action', 'movie', 'hit', 'spot.I', 'recommend', 'movie']",N/A

I was expecting much much more than what this film delivered. While it does have some entertainment value and the premise is a good one, the film failed to use the power of the two leads to generate a good movie. While I can't say it was a total waste of time, I'd still have to say it was a mediocre effort and can't really give it much of a recommendation.****Apparently some have disagreed with my review.  I recently watched this again as it was on cable and I happened to be sitting on the couch with nothing to do.  I couldn't remember what who or what the bad guys were or how the movie was going to turn out.  I couldn't remember much of the story.  This isn't a good thing.  With a great, or even good film, I can remember exactly what is going to happen, yet it is still extremely entertaining.  With an excellent written script, like ""The Matrix"", one can find new things and twists in the second, third or maybe even the fourth viewing, but the main story line is well remembered.  My point is simply that this movie was not very memorable and that isn't a good thing.

I figured that putting all these people together to make a movie would result in a great product.  Though Conspiracy Theory isn&#65533;t bad, it isn&#65533;t that great, either.Gibson plays Jerry Fletcher, a cab driver who obsesses over government conspiracies in his spare time.  He pours over the newspaper everyday to try and uncover secret plots that the government doesn&#65533;t want the public to know about.  He&#65533;s also infatuated with Alice Sutton (played by Julia Roberts), an attorney in the Justice Department.  Jerry gets this idea that NASA is trying to kill the President by deliberately causing an earthquake in Turkey while he&#65533;s there on a diplomatic visit.  Alice, of course, thinks he&#65533;s absolutely crazy.  However, it turns out that Jerry might not be as crazy as everyone thinks as one of his conspiracy theories suddenly begins to materialize.  Now Jerry must convince Alice that the government is out to get him, and together they must team up to uncover the conspiracy.This is a pretty demanding role for Mel Gibson, but he&#65533;s definitely equal to the task.  This is the kind of role that earns an actor an Oscar nomination, though he didn&#65533;t receive one.  Julia Roberts&#65533; role in the movie isn&#65533;t very demanding, and we never really get to see the full range of her acting ability, but she still does a solid job as the level-headed lawyer who is also trying to solve the mystery behind her own father&#65533;s murder.  Patrick Stewart is also in the movie, and he plays some sort of evil doctor in charge of running a government experiment that turns average people into raging assassins.This is an action movie, so by rule, the feasibility of the plot is of less significance than the gunshots, chase scenes, and burning buildings.  This is probably a good thing, considering that the plot is rather far-fetched.  Most people would probably agree that there are secret conspiracies that the government does not disclose, but this whole project about turning humans into assassins doesn&#65533;t seem very viable, neither do the attempts to capture Jerry Fletcher and extract information out of him.  It all seems pretty bogus.Regardless, I have to say that I was entertained.  Though I might not remember what the movie was about a month from now, it was definitely two hours well spent.

101081,AYP5ANZ0ICNKM,0790733234,"C. Entner ""The Great Etnebob""","[0, 1]","I am a pretty big fan of Mel Gibson. Not the biggest, it is not like he is my favorite movie star, or that I own many of his movies, I don't. But I do really appreciate his work because he is a very gifted actor. Now in most of his movies, like Lethal Weapon or Braveheart, he plays a strong guy, who you do not want to mess with. Never has he played a guy like the one he plays in this movie. In this movie you get to see him play a very funny and likable character who is very paranoid, and seems to have serious problems with women. It was a refreshing new role to see him in and I have to say that I was really impressed. But enough about him let's move on.Another actor in this movie who seemed to step out of his realm was the great Patrick Stewart, of Star Trek: The Next Generation, or more recently as Proffesor Xavier in the hit X-Men movies. Usually Stewart plays the admirable leader who always chooses the path that is good for everyone, never before this (at least not to my knowldge) has he played a role like this where he is the horrible super villian that is just fun to root against. I mean this guy is very evil, and I was happy to see that Stewart could pull it off, no problem.Then we move onto Julia Roberts, who I have been gaining more and more respect for her as I go back and look for her in her non chickflick movies, which up until a few years ago I thought those stupid chick flicks were the only kind've movies that she made. She is good in this movie and seems very believable. I had no problem believing her in this part and in the end that is what truly counts.Now this movie is very well written and very heavilly plotted so in oredr to truly understand it you have to be willing to pay attention throughout the movie. If you just keep your eyes and ears open you should deffinitly get it and enjoy it. If you are too lazy or stupid to try a complex movie then this movie is deffinitly not for you.This movie is about a cab driver who as you see from the very begginining is exstremly paranoid. He writes a little newsletter that he gives to his subscribers, about ten people more or less, and in this newletter he tells all about the conspiracys he thinks are going on at that time. Then there is Julia Roberts, who Mel Gibsons character seems to be stalking. He goes to her office all the time and tries to tell her of all the crazy junk that he believes is going on so that she would so somthing about it.Now as you watch this movie you get the feeling that this same routine has been going on for a long time. Eventully though somthing in his latest newsletter sets the government off and suddenly Gibson and Roberts are being chased by an unknown enemy headed by Patrick Stewart. If this intrigues you I suggest that you by the movie to find out the rest of the story, because what I told you is not even close to half of the story. Just be prepared to hear the song I Love You Baby, sung about a million times by the actors throughout the movie, and believe me none of them should be taking ant singing carrears anytime soon. That is about it and I believe it is time for me to say NUFF SAID.",5,Gibson Plays a Character Unlike Any He has Played Before,1091059200,"07 29, 2004",2004,3133,"['am', 'pretty', 'big', 'fan', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Not', 'biggest', 'not', 'favorite', 'movie', 'star', 'own', 'many', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'really', 'appreciate', 'work', 'very', 'gifted', 'actor', 'Now', 'most', 'movies', 'Lethal', 'Weapon', 'Braveheart', 'strong', 'guy', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'mess', 'Never', 'played', 'guy', 'one', 'movie', 'movie', 'get', 'see', 'play', 'very', 'funny', 'likable', 'character', 'who', 'very', 'paranoid', 'have', 'serious', 'problems', 'women', 'was', 'refreshing', 'new', 'role', 'see', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'really', 'impressed', 'enough', 'let', 'move', 'on.Another', 'actor', 'movie', 'who', 'seemed', 'step', 'out', 'realm', 'was', 'great', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Generation', 'more', 'recently', 'Proffesor', 'Xavier', 'hit', 'X-Men', 'movies', 'Usually', 'Stewart', 'admirable', 'leader', 'who', 'always', 'path', 'good', 'everyone', 'never', 'least', 'not', 'knowldge', 'played', 'role', 'where', 'horrible', 'super', 'villian', 'just', 'fun', 'root', 'mean', 'guy', 'very', 'evil', 'was', 'happy', 'see', 'Stewart', 'could', 'pull', 'off', 'problem.Then', 'move', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'gaining', 'more', 'more', 'respect', 'go', 'back', 'look', 'non', 'chickflick', 'movies', 'up', 'few', 'years', 'thought', 'stupid', 'chick', 'flicks', 'were', 'only', 'kind', ""'ve"", 'movies', 'made', 'good', 'movie', 'very', 'believable', 'had', 'problem', 'believing', 'part', 'end', 'what', 'truly', 'counts.Now', 'movie', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'very', 'heavilly', 'plotted', 'so', 'oredr', 'truly', 'understand', 'have', 'be', 'willing', 'pay', 'attention', 'movie', 'just', 'keep', 'eyes', 'ears', 'open', 'should', 'deffinitly', 'get', 'enjoy', 'are', 'too', 'lazy', 'stupid', 'try', 'complex', 'movie', 'then', 'movie', 'deffinitly', 'not', 'you.This', 'movie', 'cab', 'driver', 'who', 'see', 'very', 'begginining', 'exstremly', 'paranoid', 'little', 'newsletter', 'subscribers', 'about', 'ten', 'people', 'more', 'less', 'newletter', 'conspiracys', 'are', 'going', 'time', 'Then', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'who', 'Mel', 'Gibsons', 'character', 'be', 'stalking', 'office', 'time', 'tries', 'tell', 'crazy', 'junk', 'going', 'would', 'so', 'somthing', 'about', 'it.Now', 'watch', 'movie', 'get', 'feeling', 'same', 'routine', 'been', 'going', 'long', 'time', 'Eventully', 'somthing', 'latest', 'newsletter', 'government', 'suddenly', 'Gibson', 'Roberts', 'are', 'being', 'chased', 'unknown', 'enemy', 'headed', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'suggest', 'movie', 'find', 'out', 'rest', 'story', 'what', 'told', 'not', 'even', 'close', 'half', 'story', 'Just', 'be', 'prepared', 'hear', 'song', 'Love', 'Baby', 'sung', 'million', 'times', 'actors', 'movie', 'believe', 'none', 'should', 'be', 'taking', 'ant', 'singing', 'carrears', 'anytime', 'soon', 'believe', 'time', 'say', 'NUFF', 'SAID']",N/A

After a seizure leads to his taking a customer on a wild ride, he checks on Alice Sutton, a Justice Department worker, deftly played by a soft-looking but very animated Julia Roberts.This time, we aren't offered any blood-soaked,testosterone-filled ego trips as in &quot;Braveheart&quot;, nor any feminine thoughts filling Mel's straight, narrow, delicate-looking, paper clip-shaped ears as in &quot;What Women Want&quot;. But we are given a potential love story between two people of very different backgrounds who somehow click because of their willingness to look out for each other.Jerry Fletcher's love for Ms. Sutton is obvious. But after several unauthorized visits to her at work, he is captured and tortured by the sinister Dr. Jonas, who is determined to kill Jerry before he can reveal the truth about a crime Jonas comitted.Jerry escapes the clutches of his nemesis, who is played by a vulture-like Patrick Stewart. Consoled by the sympathetic Alice, Jerry is hospitalized. But the chase continues.About the only bit of sexuality in this film is Mel roaming about in his hospital gown, revealing that (a)he still has the glowing, beautiful complexion that artists love, and that (b)even when looking like a frightened little boy with dip smeared on his face, he still has those rippling biceps, which are revealed when his sleeve is raised as he struggles in the hospital's laundry chute.Sloe-eyed and smoky-complexioned Cylk Cozart is an intelligence agent who is influenced by Jonas at first, but helps the right people once he finds out the truth. He plays his role with a lot of dignity and reserve.Terry Alexander was amusing to watch as the newspaper vendor who listens to Jerry's theories.

101095,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,0790733234,Dennis Littrell,"[13, 19]","Forgive me, but I liked this movie.  I was seduced, I guess, because objectively speaking this is just your usual phony thriller, with chase  scenes beginning in the first reel and continuing throughout, with the  little guy as hero, and a convoluted plot worthy of a wanna-be thriller  writer retired from the CIA.Mel Gibson plays a New York City cabby  addicted to conspiracy theories, but (of course) it turns out that ""just  because you're paranoid doesn't mean they're not out to get you.""  And boy  are they ever!  I felt every second that this was a stretch for Gibson, yet  I think he almost made it.  I admire his ability and his supreme  confidence that he can play anybody.  (He didn't do a bad job as Hamlet.)  But here I think he is just too handsome and balanced and just too, too  normal looking to make us believe he is a paranoid stalker.  I mean, how  many women would be worried if Mel Gibson was stalking them?  Still the  plot, properly understood, allows for a normal man to end up in his  situation since he was brainwashed and drugged.Julia Roberts as a  justice department lawyer is beautiful beyond any telling of it, and she  does have a face for the silver screen like no other.  Hollywood, as Norma  Desmond told us, is about faces, and director Richard Donner had the very  good sense to put the camera tight, very tight, on Julia Roberts' face as  often as possible and keep it there.  She is especially good at projecting  a wide range of emotions, including love, without saying a word, and I  would say that is what has made her the great star that she is.  Her face  is so sexy that the five-second scene where she hops out of bed in her  loose-fitting pajamas was pure eroticism.There are a number of clever  bits in the movie, including our paranoid hero keeping his food locked in  canisters in a locked refrigerator.  I also liked the part where Roberts  gains entrance by telling the hospital orderly that she is with the  Treasury Department, and for ID hands him a hundred-dollar bill, allowing  him to quip, ""This IS from the Treasury Department.""  Good too was Gibson  caught by a network hook-up to a price scanner at the book store  compulsively buying a copy of Salinger's ""Catcher in the Rye.""  (Shades of  a future when, through the Web, our every purchase will be known to whoever  cares.)With Mel Gibson and Julia Roberts as the stars, the subplot has  got to be romantic, and it is.

As there are a number of very disturbed people who really are taking this for granted the movie could have served a great deal on giving us an insight on their lives.But no, of course, Gibson *is* watched, he *is* being kidnapped by some government agency and so on. At that point the movie turns to complete boredom. We all can sense what will happen and the ending in itself screams &quot;tested with 200 audiences&quot; at you. Even if we leave logic aside and say, ok, he is watched, the story stays low-level; all of the most secure and highly secret agencies can be identified by usually driving black cars with government license plates to make identification even more convenient.It is to say that Gibson did some good acting here; he probably saves the movie from complete catastrophe.

101111,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,0790733234,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[1, 3]","Quite a very good film. It is a thriller and the main character looks and sounds psychotic at least, if not schizophrenic. He definitely speaks of some kind of persecution and he lives right at the heart of a conspiracy and we discover very fast he is the one who is trying to undo it. The film becomes very complex little by little and we are confronted to various security agencies fighting one against the others to capture that man and the main names are CIA and FBI. What makes the film even more complex is that the man is in love, and we know that from the very first moment he is tom-peeping onto her, with the woman who works for the Justice Department, third official security force in the picture. The point is to understand why these people are after him and why he is after the Justice Department to which he wants to speak. What is the secret in that man's head and mind? The film is a perfect thriller because of the action but also because that action is not for itself, for the sake of itself, for its own sake. That action is treacherous because we do not know whether we have to support those official security services or the woman who is kind of an innocent witness trapped in the middle of a mud pile or the man who seems to be justified in a way to run away because of the violence the security services put on the table. The end will be tricky in many ways but the film will remain one more film on the danger of the industrial military complex and the divided loyalties of the security services in such situations. Some of them are after all maybe not so bad. Maybe we can sleep in full peace and in one piece, trusting the faithfulness of some security agents who will reprieve the bad reputation of their agencies.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID",5,Public emergency paranoia,1198454400,"12 24, 2007",2007,1875,"['very', 'good', 'film', 'thriller', 'main', 'character', 'looks', 'psychotic', 'least', 'not', 'schizophrenic', 'definitely', 'kind', 'persecution', 'right', 'heart', 'conspiracy', 'discover', 'very', 'fast', 'one', 'who', 'trying', 'undo', 'film', 'very', 'complex', 'little', 'little', 'are', 'confronted', 'various', 'security', 'agencies', 'fighting', 'one', 'others', 'capture', 'man', 'main', 'names', 'are', 'CIA', 'FBI', 'What', 'film', 'even', 'more', 'complex', 'man', 'love', 'know', 'very', 'first', 'moment', 'tom-peeping', 'woman', 'who', 'Justice', 'Department', 'third', 'official', 'security', 'force', 'picture', 'point', 'understand', 'why', 'people', 'are', 'why', 'Justice', 'Department', 'speak', 'What', 'secret', 'man', 'head', 'mind', 'film', 'perfect', 'thriller', 'action', 'also', 'action', 'not', 'sake', 'own', 'sake', 'action', 'treacherous', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'have', 'support', 'official', 'security', 'services', 'woman', 'who', 'kind', 'innocent', 'witness', 'trapped', 'middle', 'mud', 'pile', 'man', 'who', 'be', 'justified', 'way', 'run', 'away', 'violence', 'security', 'services', 'put', 'table', 'end', 'will', 'be', 'tricky', 'many', 'ways', 'film', 'will', 'remain', 'one', 'more', 'film', 'danger', 'industrial', 'military', 'complex', 'divided', 'loyalties', 'security', 'services', 'such', 'situations', 'are', 'maybe', 'not', 'so', 'bad', 'Maybe', 'can', 'sleep', 'full', 'peace', 'one', 'piece', 'trusting', 'faithfulness', 'security', 'agents', 'who', 'will', 'reprieve', 'bad', 'reputation', 'agencies.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Paris', '8', 'Saint', 'Denis', 'University', 'Paris', '12', 'Cr', 'eacute', 'CEGID']",N/A

It plays out nothing like you think it will, and the ending leaves you wanting more.

Not so with this one, to tell you the truth I think this is one of Robert's better movies, I really enjoy her character in this one. All of the acting is solid.The only reason there aren't five stars is because during a scene in a barnyard Gibson explains everything and then Julia Roberts buys it all right there, a little to typical of women's characters in movies.

Jerry Fletcher (Gibson) is to all appearances a clinically obsessive and paranoid  individual who thinks everything is a conspiracy. As a New York City cab  driver, he is the perfect individual for conversation. But there is  something to be said about this man who rants and raves every time he has a  fare. The truth of the matter is that he is not so far out of touch with  what is going on and will do anything to expose the government as well as  protect himself and Alice Sutton (Julia Roberts), a justice department  attorney who later finds reasons of her own to mistrust the government.  The story takes a turn for the worst when a certain government  psychiatrist/ agony authority named Dr. Jonas, (Patrick Stewart in a less  kindhearted but very convincing role) takes notice of Fletcher's snooping  around and decides to find out (more like squeeze out) what Yellow Cab's  most chatty crusader knows about Black Ops. The film does require the  audience to pay attention so as not to lose track of the plot, but aside  from that, I feel this is one of the best works director Richard Donner has  put forth in a long time. This is also a far better example of the  director's work than his previous 1995 box office flop, Assassins. As far  as manipulation films go, Conspiracy Theory is no JFK in that it is shorter  and less bleeding-heart, but it is also not Three Days of the Condor, for  it falls short of being as effective as a movie from the mid-1970's, which  was made during a time when government mistrust was at an all time high.",3,"Paranoia so thick, it's real.",959040000,"05 23, 2000",2000,1679,"['Mel', 'Gibson', 'cynicism', 'conventionality', 'when', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'be', 'government', 'conspiracy', 'Jerry', 'Fletcher', 'Gibson', 'appearances', 'clinically', 'obsessive', 'paranoid', 'individual', 'who', 'everything', 'conspiracy', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'cab', 'driver', 'perfect', 'individual', 'conversation', 'something', 'be', 'said', 'man', 'who', 'time', 'fare', 'truth', 'matter', 'not', 'so', 'far', 'touch', 'what', 'going', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'expose', 'government', 'as', 'well', 'protect', 'Alice', 'Sutton', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'justice', 'department', 'attorney', 'who', 'later', 'reasons', 'own', 'mistrust', 'government', 'story', 'turn', 'worst', 'when', 'certain', 'government', 'psychiatrist/', 'agony', 'authority', 'named', 'Dr.', 'Jonas', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'less', 'kindhearted', 'very', 'convincing', 'role', 'notice', 'Fletcher', 'snooping', 'around', 'find', 'out', 'more', 'squeeze', 'out', 'what', 'Yellow', 'Cab', 'most', 'chatty', 'crusader', 'Black', 'Ops', 'film', 'require', 'audience', 'pay', 'attention', 'so', 'not', 'lose', 'track', 'plot', 'aside', 'feel', 'one', 'best', 'works', 'director', 'Richard', 'Donner', 'put', 'forth', 'long', 'time', 'also', 'far', 'better', 'example', 'director', 'work', 'previous', '1995', 'box', 'office', 'flop', 'Assassins', 'As', 'far', 'manipulation', 'films', 'go', 'Conspiracy', 'Theory', 'JFK', 'shorter', 'less', 'bleeding-heart', 'also', 'not', 'Three', 'Days', 'Condor', 'short', 'being', 'as', 'effective', 'movie', 'mid-1970', 'was', 'made', 'time', 'when', 'government', 'mistrust', 'was', 'time', 'high']",N/A

101129,A16X61RLY1YJL7,0790733234,"K. Wyatt ""ssintrepid""","[21, 26]","I would definitely have to say that &quot;Conspiracy Theory&quot; is one of my favorite films of all times.  The overall premise, pacing and the performances given by the actors lends heavily to this opinion.  The one intriguing yet very strange thing about this movie is seeing Patrick Stewart playing the bad guy.  After years and years of parts in which he is generally one of the good guys and then of course, his role as Captain Jean Luc Picard on Star Trek The Next Generation solidified his status as the &quot;ultimate&quot; good guy, it's very difficult to see him on the wrong side of the script.  As usual though, his performance is as top notch as it is in any project he immerses himself.Mel Gibson's performance as Jerry Fletcher in this film is quite a show.  Just imagine his demeanor as Riggs from the &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; movies and &quot;crazy&quot; it up a few notches and you have Mel Gibson as Jerry Fletcher, an Oscar caliber performance unrewarded.  What can one say about Julia Roberts; she does her thing in this film and it works very well.  That's the one strange thing about Julia Roberts, in most of her films, you don't see a very drastic difference in her performances, she pretty much does the same thing film for &quot;most&quot; of her films and they keep on being box office hits.As testament to the quality of this film, one only needs to look at the name of the director which is Richard Donner.  For many years now, Richard Donner has directed some of the most successful television shows and films ever produced such as; &quot;Gilligan's Island,&quot; &quot;The Rifleman,&quot; &quot;Superman&quot; the movie in 1978 and all four of the &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; movies, hence Mel Gibson's casting in the lead role of &quot;Conspiracy Theory.&quot;  Needless to say, if you see his name as the director of a new film, it will definitely be worth your time to watch.The Premise:Jerry Fletcher (Mel Gibson) is an extremely neurotic cab driver in New York City.  Very early in the film, you'll see that he appears to be obsessed with a lawyer by the name of Alice Sutton (Julia Roberts).  As the title of the movie suggests, Jerry sees conspiracies every where and despite telling everybody about it to include Alice, nobody seems to believe him and he doesn't even appear to believe himself until Dr. Jonas and his crew steps in and abducts him...What follows from there is clearly one of Mel Gibson's best films that I've found to be quite enjoyable over several different viewings as this film is quite well worth multiple viewings.  I highly recommend this film to any and all who are interested in films from this genre of action/adventure and mystery.  {ssintrepid}Special Features:This is the only downside to this DVD version, a serious lack of special features.-Production Notes-Theatrical Trailer",5,Conspiracy Theory - An extremely well made film!,1076371200,"02 10, 2004",2004,2848,"['would', 'definitely', 'have', 'say', 'quot', 'Conspiracy', 'Theory', 'quot', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'times', 'overall', 'premise', 'pacing', 'performances', 'given', 'actors', 'heavily', 'opinion', 'one', 'intriguing', 'yet', 'very', 'strange', 'thing', 'movie', 'seeing', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'playing', 'bad', 'guy', 'years', 'years', 'parts', 'generally', 'one', 'good', 'guys', 'then', 'course', 'role', 'Captain', 'Jean', 'Luc', 'Picard', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Generation', 'solidified', 'status', 'quot', 'ultimate', 'quot', 'good', 'guy', 'very', 'difficult', 'see', 'wrong', 'side', 'script', 'usual', 'performance', 'top', 'notch', 'project', 'himself.Mel', 'Gibson', 'performance', 'Jerry', 'Fletcher', 'film', 'quite', 'show', 'Just', 'imagine', 'demeanor', 'Riggs', 'quot', 'Lethal', 'Weapon', 'quot', 'movies', 'quot', 'crazy', 'quot', 'up', 'few', 'notches', 'have', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Jerry', 'Fletcher', 'Oscar', 'caliber', 'performance', 'unrewarded', 'What', 'can', 'one', 'say', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'thing', 'film', 'very', 'well', 'one', 'strange', 'thing', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'most', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'very', 'drastic', 'difference', 'performances', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'thing', 'film', 'quot', 'most', 'quot', 'films', 'keep', 'being', 'box', 'office', 'hits.As', 'testament', 'quality', 'film', 'one', 'only', 'look', 'name', 'director', 'Richard', 'Donner', 'many', 'years', 'now', 'Richard', 'Donner', 'directed', 'most', 'successful', 'television', 'shows', 'films', 'ever', 'produced', 'such', 'quot', 'Gilligan', 'Island', 'quot', 'quot', 'Rifleman', 'quot', 'quot', 'Superman', 'quot', 'movie', '1978', 'four', 'quot', 'Lethal', 'Weapon', 'quot', 'movies', 'hence', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'casting', 'lead', 'role', 'quot', 'Conspiracy', 'Theory.', 'quot', 'Needless', 'say', 'see', 'name', 'director', 'new', 'film', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', 'time', 'watch.The', 'Premise', 'Jerry', 'Fletcher', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'extremely', 'neurotic', 'cab', 'driver', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Very', 'early', 'film', ""'ll"", 'see', 'be', 'obsessed', 'lawyer', 'name', 'Alice', 'Sutton', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'title', 'movie', 'Jerry', 'conspiracies', 'where', 'telling', 'everybody', 'include', 'Alice', 'nobody', 'believe', ""n't"", 'even', 'appear', 'believe', 'Dr.', 'Jonas', 'crew', 'steps', 'abducts', 'What', 'clearly', 'one', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'best', 'films', ""'ve"", 'found', 'be', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'several', 'different', 'viewings', 'film', 'quite', 'well', 'worth', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'films', 'genre', 'action/adventure', 'mystery', 'ssintrepid', 'Special', 'Features', 'only', 'downside', 'DVD', 'version', 'serious', 'lack', 'special', 'features.-Production', 'Notes-Theatrical', 'Trailer']",N/A

101137,ABE8YHLYSM15G,0790733234,Luke Killion,"[1, 2]","""Conspiracy Theory"" is a 1997 Mel Gibson fllm. This title struck me as being sraight ahead and even audacious in a way. To title a movie with such a large banner line type concept is quite a declaration of the film's weight. It is also common for generic Hollywood action flicks. Fortunately, this movie comes through as both a complex thriller and commercially viable product.There is definately the classic mix of what you'd expect in a spy movie: the title character Jerry Fletcher(Gibson) is on the run after one of his supposedly paranoid tabloid theories holds water. Fletcher is a New York City cab driver whose small following of readers is suddenly elminated (of course in clever fashion with a series of heartattacks, strokes and accidents) after an abortive to kidnap Jerry and make ""gravy"" out of his brain. The themes of CIA torture and experimental operations/research is central to the basis of the tale, which sends Jerry running for a place to hide, all the while being aided by the female lead, Alice Sutton.Julia Roberts gives her usual high calibre preformance as a Justice Department official who humours Jerry by listening to his theories after he saved her during a mugging. Her life and family secrets began to emerge and the near stalking which Alice allows Jerry to engage in divulges a deeper and more meaningful act that connects these two people's pasts. The tandem of Gibson and Roberts is a quirky one; I thought they worked well on screen, as she is able to function as the rational half to his maniacal flights of paranoia, some of which turn out to be not so crazy and shows the burden of taking on something like the CIA. While Jerry is their prime target, Alice is initially above the wrath of Dr. Janus' secret department.I thought this movie had alot of the same elements as the 1990's Fox TV show ""The X Files"", which dealt with abnormal psychologial cases. The chemistry that grows between Alice and Jerry is very much like the Fox Mulder/ Dana Sculley relationship in ""X Files"", as she is like the voice of reason while he seems at first to be a raving paranoid type, yet the often humourous habits Jerry has in safeguarding even his most mundane househould items with combination locks reveal an inner knowlegde of a system that is too large for anyone one man to take on. Alice greatly assists in this role as do other government agents who've become suspicious of Dr. Janus (played by Patrick Stewart). Janus is the classic evil spy master/ psychiatrist, who runs field operations as well as sessions of ""interoggation"", which lean toward Sci Fi.It is great entertainment and the usual cliche of the ""bad guy"" CIA agent is used here, but this version has a intricate plot which incorporates alot of Agency history into the main characters' back story. This makes what would usually be a typical Hollywood action flick into something a bit more stimulating in the writing department, rather than simply relying on big booms and fast chase scenes. There are plenty of both, but these are made that much better by coherent writing.",4,Good mix of spy movie chase and fully developed character preformances,1357689600,"01 9, 2013",2013,3072,"['Conspiracy', 'Theory', '1997', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'fllm', 'title', 'struck', 'being', 'sraight', 'ahead', 'even', 'audacious', 'way', 'title', 'movie', 'large', 'banner', 'line', 'type', 'concept', 'quite', 'declaration', 'film', 'weight', 'also', 'common', 'generic', 'Hollywood', 'action', 'flicks', 'Fortunately', 'movie', 'complex', 'thriller', 'commercially', 'viable', 'product.There', 'definately', 'classic', 'mix', 'what', ""'d"", 'expect', 'spy', 'movie', 'title', 'character', 'Jerry', 'Fletcher', 'Gibson', 'run', 'one', 'supposedly', 'paranoid', 'tabloid', 'theories', 'water', 'Fletcher', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'cab', 'driver', 'small', 'following', 'readers', 'suddenly', 'elminated', 'course', 'clever', 'fashion', 'series', 'heartattacks', 'strokes', 'accidents', 'abortive', 'kidnap', 'Jerry', 'make', 'gravy', 'brain', 'themes', 'CIA', 'torture', 'experimental', 'operations/research', 'central', 'basis', 'tale', 'Jerry', 'running', 'place', 'hide', 'while', 'being', 'aided', 'female', 'lead', 'Alice', 'Sutton.Julia', 'Roberts', 'usual', 'high', 'calibre', 'preformance', 'Justice', 'Department', 'official', 'who', 'Jerry', 'listening', 'theories', 'saved', 'mugging', 'life', 'family', 'secrets', 'began', 'emerge', 'near', 'stalking', 'Alice', 'Jerry', 'engage', 'divulges', 'deeper', 'more', 'meaningful', 'act', 'two', 'people', 'pasts', 'tandem', 'Gibson', 'Roberts', 'quirky', 'one', 'thought', 'worked', 'well', 'screen', 'able', 'function', 'rational', 'half', 'maniacal', 'flights', 'paranoia', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'not', 'so', 'crazy', 'burden', 'taking', 'something', 'CIA', 'Jerry', 'prime', 'target', 'Alice', 'initially', 'wrath', 'Dr.', 'Janus', 'secret', 'department.I', 'thought', 'movie', 'had', 'alot', 'same', 'elements', '1990', 'Fox', 'TV', 'show', 'X', 'Files', 'abnormal', 'psychologial', 'cases', 'chemistry', 'Alice', 'Jerry', 'very', 'much', 'Fox', 'Mulder/', 'Dana', 'Sculley', 'relationship', 'X', 'Files', 'voice', 'reason', 'first', 'be', 'raving', 'paranoid', 'type', 'often', 'humourous', 'habits', 'Jerry', 'safeguarding', 'even', 'most', 'mundane', 'househould', 'items', 'combination', 'locks', 'reveal', 'inner', 'knowlegde', 'system', 'too', 'large', 'anyone', 'one', 'man', 'take', 'Alice', 'greatly', 'role', 'do', 'other', 'government', 'agents', 'who', ""'ve"", 'become', 'suspicious', 'Dr.', 'Janus', 'played', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'Janus', 'classic', 'evil', 'spy', 'master/', 'psychiatrist', 'who', 'field', 'operations', 'as', 'well', 'sessions', 'interoggation', 'Sci', 'Fi.It', 'great', 'entertainment', 'usual', 'cliche', 'bad', 'guy', 'CIA', 'agent', 'used', 'here', 'version', 'intricate', 'plot', 'alot', 'Agency', 'history', 'main', 'characters', 'back', 'story', 'would', 'usually', 'be', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'action', 'flick', 'something', 'bit', 'more', 'stimulating', 'writing', 'department', 'rather', 'simply', 'relying', 'big', 'booms', 'fast', 'chase', 'scenes', 'are', 'plenty', 'are', 'made', 'much', 'better', 'coherent', 'writing']",N/A

Of course he is proved correct, but that makes his odd mannerisms, rantings, mumblings, bug-eyed expressions, etc. all the more puzzling.  Only a rational person could have put together all these puzzle pieces, but he doesn't seem rational at all.  If you met Jerry Fletcher on the street you'd think he was seriously mentally ill.  The writers or director fell into the trap of trying to play Fletcher off as a crazy person so as to give the story a twist when he is later vindicated.  This ""twist"" doesn't really  work.It's more than just Mel's character.  The whole movie lacks any sort of credibility.  Movies about shadowy government or quasi-government agencies and operatives either work well or fail miserably.  It's a hard formula to get right.  Unfortunately, CT doesn't get the formula right at all.Movies are about entertainment and sometimes to be entertained one has to suspend his knowledge about the way things really are to enjoy the fantasy world the story creates.  A good movie makes that easy for you: the fantasy appears at least somewhat plausible.  Conspiracy Theory isn't one of those ""good movies"".

The basic premise of the movie evolves around a taxi driver, Jerry (Gibson), who is extremely paranoid (for reasons the  movie reveals), and believes that everything is a conspiracy theory.  He  becomes obsessed with a woman, Julia Roberts, who works in the justice  department, and looks to her for support in his ideas.  When Gibson is  captured by the very people he fears, things start becoming complicated,  you start to realise that there is more foundation to his  &quot;lunacy&quot; and he is maybe not as crazy as you thought...or is he  worse?  The plot then twists and turns its way to the end, in true thriller  style.Roberts and Gibson are a fantastic combination, that really  gives the movie its edge.  Gibsons portrayal of Jerry is nothing short of  brilliant, and there is also a strong supporting cast who  give good  performances.  Although the movies plot is serious, the characters, Jerry  in particular, are amusing and give the movie an overall light-hearted  feel, in some scenes, when Gibson escapes from his captures in a wheelchair  for instance, the film verges on being a black comedy, renminiscent of  'Very Bad Things' style madness.  There is also a subtle love story thrown  in for good measure (what Hollywood movie is complete without one?),  however, its discreetness is its saviour and actually adds something to the  plot without becoming &quot;icky&quot;.

Julia, like Mel has a history of same-old, same-old movie making.  Prior to 'Conspiracy Theory' both Julia and Mel had made a  career of mediocre movies...with the possible exceptions of Mel's 'Mad Max'  flicks, except they got pretty formula after number one. Up till now, Mel's  forever stuck in the 'Lethal Weapon' mode and Julia had been stuck in the  'Best Friend's Wedding  and Notting Hill' mode.  The long-term effect of  all this mediocrity has been Julia's turning into a human stick  figure...which just accentuates her huge mouth and liver-like lips.  With  Mel, the effect has been to make his up till recently charming Aussie  accent to fade away.  He now sounds like a farmer from Iowa.  But this  movie vindicates them both.  Never have I seen Julia actually 'act' before  and Mel, my god I almost died when he didn't get the Academy Award for  'Actor showing most promise' in a starring role. I theorize maybe that  strategically putting Patrick Stewart in the movie as the corrupted  Government Bad Guy acutally cowed Julia and Mel into earning their pay.  Patrick was, after all, the only one with a B.A. in acting from an  accredited acting school in Britain...where it all began...so that paid  off.  Oh, the plot was okay, and the action was so-so.

The movie is that much better overall because of its two main stars, Mel Gibson and Julia Roberts.  New York cabbie, Jerry Fletcher, writes a conspiracy newsletter who is paranoid about what &quot;they&quot; are doing all over the world.  Jerry tries to explain the conspiracies to Alice, a Justice Department lawyer, who he saved from a robbery.  However, someone is watching Jerry because he might know to much.  This is an exciting movie with several twists and turns that will keep you interested throughout.  There is something here for everyone with some action, comedy, and romance between Gibson and Roberts.Mel Gibson gives a very good performance as New York cabbie, Jerry Fletcher.  He is fully believable as the slightly off-kilter man who believes there is a conspiracy behind everything.  Julia Roberts is equally as good as Alice, the woman trying to help Jerry if she can as he is chased down by government officials.  Gibson and Roberts are very good together.  Patrick Stewart is equally creepy as Jonas, the man leading the operation to capture Jerry.  The DVD offers widescreen and fullscreen presentations, production notes, and theatrical trailers.

A delightfully disturbed Mel Gibson is a cabbie who rambles incessantly about conspiracy theories to his passengers, himself, and occasionally, no one at all. At the end of the day, he sits in his car and spies on Julia Roberts as she works out on her treadmill. Mel apparently also has a habit of bursting in on Julia at work (Dept of Justice), doing more ranting, and being escorted out of the building. OK, an intriguing opening, what will happen next?Next we're thrust into a weird, trippy sequence of Mel being kidnapped, tortured, and interrogated by Patrick Stewart and his unidentified cronies. Mel escapes, runs back to Julia's office, rants some more. The rest of the movie is a bunch of convoluted chase/capture/escape scenes, with a little awkward romantic tension (and I mean AWKWARD, Mel and Julia have absolutely ZERO chemistry), a bit of dramatic emotion tossed in for good measure (who killed my father? OMG tell me who killed my father that the audience has never seen and cares nothing about!), and...That's it.We never find out exactly who or what the heck was happening through the entire movie. The whole movie is ""who are you, REALLY?"" and virtually no answers are given. A hasty bit of explanation here and there, but nothing that congeals the story together and makes it make the least bit of sense.The movie closes with Julia mourning at Mel's (supposed) grave, and her last words for him? ""I miss your face."" I'm not kidding. That's the most poignant line the writers could come up with, apparently. I was laughing out loud.Of course, then we see Mel lurking alongside Julia as she rides her horse, in a huge black obviously-government-issued SUV, and she has NO CLUE that he's there. Even though he's on the road right next to the field she's riding in, and no other cars are in sight. He's invisible! Right? *cough*A messy story with a way-too-hokey ending.
