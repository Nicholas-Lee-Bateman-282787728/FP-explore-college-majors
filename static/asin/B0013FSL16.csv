Manufacturers take advantage of this market three ways to sunday.  First we have Sony putting out the first season to dozens of shows and then not following up with the rest of the seasons. Thus leaving our libraries incomplete. Then we have writers striking for better wages and manufacturers use this as an excuse to sell mediocre packages of media at prime prices. Now we have half of a season selling at the price of what it would cost to purchase the complete season. All in all, there are laws to put us away for smoking too close to a building and spitting on the sidewalk but manufacturers can get away with manipulating sales by how they put out materials. Where is the law that protects the customer. The law that says, hey you promise quality goods and you get paid for it, so pony up boys, pony up and give quality where quality is due. Sony, Fox or michael jackson and anyone else that has cornered the market on media manipulation should be held accountable.

Our favorite bad guy, Christian Troy, as well as his sexually deviant side kick Kimber, is up to their old tricks. The Julia McNamara character is as socially helpless as ever and Sean is struggling with being the consummate doormat. The Matt character got a chance to spread his acting wings (although I'm glad he didn't go thru with the gay sex scene). I hate to see the Gina character released because I loved her sexually needy character. The Eden character was a nice addition to the storyline and John Schneider, turns in some convincing performances as porn king Ram Peters. For all those sour puss reviewers, the underlying theme of the show has always been superficiality (or the fulfillment of needs thru superficial means) that's why the show started off in Miami, and moved to Los Angeles. The show is about need, loneliness, inferiority issues, sexual abuse and damaged souls; shouldn't we expect a little craziness? Of course we should!

1141923,A1P6MKKYNSMCML,B0013FSL16,Fast Forward,"[1, 1]","After much thinking, I have finally figured out the system the writers of this show must have: 5 boxes on a table.  Box #1 contains character names on slips of paper. #2 contains couples on the slips. #3  has various acts of treachery on the paper slips.  Box #4 contains slips with various diversified sex acts on them.  And Box #5 contains slips with Plastic Surgery operations such as penile enlargement, breast reduction, etc.  Take a slip at random from #1 and match it to a slip from #5.  Take another slip from #1 and  match with a slip from #3.  Get 3 slips from  #2 and match them up (at random, of course) with 3 slips from Box #4. And there's your show.  The contrast is amazing--fabulous actors giving reality to a storyline that spins and careers out of control!This season features a wide selection of troublesome women. There's the Monroe-ish Kimber, who has a heart the size and temperature of a frozen pea,  and has an ego with the size and toxic atmosphere of Jupiter. There's Colleen, a ""stuffy"" old hag. Kate is the ultimate drag: she goes around with an unhappy look on her face, and Sean spends 99% of his time talking, trying to get her to smile. When she does, the smile disappears after 3 seconds. Definitely a high-maintenance relationship.  Julia also spends the season having a hysterical fit every 5 minutes. She upbraids Sean for his infidelities while she cheats on him. When she finally gets her comeuppance, I almost feel like cheering.  But the real dark-entity of this piece is Eden: an evil trollop par excellence. Eden's narcissistic ego rivals Kimber's, but unlike Kimber she has no heart. She gives psychopaths a bad name. She can't screw over enough people fast enough, and her mother Olivia is as stupid as she is rich.  The potty-mouthed Gina also puts in an appearance again, just to strike fear into Christian Troy's heart. Add to this about 100 lies, several murders, some gory operation scenes, and mix well, for a show that truly entices.In this season, Liz Cruz shines as never before. She is the stable anchor to the madness going on all around her and it's when Liz is on camera, that the audience knows that reason will somehow prevail.

There's some inventive twists that are abound, including the downward spiral that Matt (John Hensley) and Kimber (Kelly Carlson) are on, and Julia's (Joely Richardson) surprising new realationship.  There's pivotal guest star roles from Portia de Rossi, John Schneider, and sexy AnnaLynne McCord, and Nip/Tuck still manages to be entertaining five seasons in, even though this season just simply isn't as good as previous seasons of the series.

Things became so ridiculous that by the time Julia developed amnesia, I was laughing aloud and thinking I tuned into ""As the World Turns"" by accident.

1141936,A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F,B0013FSL16,"Terrance Richard ""Terry Richard""","[0, 0]","""Nip/Tuck"" returns for another wonderful season with a brand new locale. Creator and producer Ryan Murphy wisely decided to keep the series fresh by moving ""Nip/Tuck"" to Hollywood where Christian and Sean move their plastic surgery practice. Other series regulars like Matt, Liz, Kimber, and Julia are along for the ride and the series looks fresh and innovative. Most TV dramas become boring and sluggish in their fifth year, but by moving our beloved ""Nip/Tuck"" to the Southland gives the show real newness and originality in their plotlines and characters. Besides what better place to have a show set that deals with plastic surgery than Los Angeles? There are also a slew of great guest-stars that pop up this year including John Schneider, who plays a porn producer, and Rosie O'Donnel who reprises her role as Dawn Budge. However, it is Sharon Gless' virtuoso performance as a so-called agent that steals the spotlight this year. To say that Gless' performance is blood curdling is an understatement. She even received an Emmy nomination for her role.This boxset features the first 14 episodes that were filmed in season 5. There was originally suppose to be 22 shows filmed that year but due to a writer's strike only 14 were shot. The 8 remaining shows from season 5 are being released in October, 2009 in a separate set called ""Nip/Tuck-Season 5, Part 2"". I am sure that in time a complete Season 5 boxset will be released. However, if you can't wait to view these 14 shows, like me, buy this set: these  episodes are some of the best the series has made!On a final note ""Nip/Tuck"" went dark on June 19th, 2009, meaning the show finished filming permanently.
