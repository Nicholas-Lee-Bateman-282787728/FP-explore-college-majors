792587,A39AZT0WDM8AC9,B00013RC4I,KEVIN BRIAN,"[1, 1]","I'm surprised that so many of the people that reviewed this movie took it so darn seriously. Come on guys, it's a B-Movie in the fashion of those old car chase films of the seventies. You know, like 'Eat my Dust' 'Race with the Devil' 'Macon County', cheesy but fun films like that. Hell, 'Smokey and the Bandit' even kept running through my head as I watched the film in awe. And Sally Field was just as annoying as the girl passanger in this one. At times it even felt like her character was supposed to be...(!)...a spoof of Sandra Bullock's character in 'Speed'. But then, there were times when I kept thinking about how much the actress reminded me of Ally Sheedy.And Casper Van Dien was perfect in this film. He's one of the cutest B-Movie heros of this generation. (Well, hello there, Tarzan)And, so what, his hair was orange!? It was a little odd, I agree, but after awhile, it just seemed to add to all the cartoon-style action.And remember folks,that's the key word, cartoon! If you watch it with that in mind, it may work for you. I will admit,at times I did find myself becoming bored with the repeated scenes of car chases, however, my curiosity of how the movie would end, kept me firmly on board. And, as someone else pointed out in a past review, it IS a real bummer when the driver, or, drivers of the phantom truck are revealed. It does change the feel and tone of the movie dramatically. It almost takes away, immediately, the crazy cartoon feel of the film. I was hoping, which I knew it wasn't going to happen, that the driver would of been more grounded in a supernatural style subplot. Like the creepy cult horror movie from the 70's 'The Car'. Good stuff!SPOILER ALERT....SPOILER ALERT.....I kept thinking to myself while watching the film....'My God! This is sooo over the top and goofy that this picture could go anywhere it wanted too'  Wouldn't it have been wonderfully delirious if, instead of three jocks climbing out of the phantom truck halfway through the movie, but a ridiculous looking cyborg, instead...?!...that continues to chase our hunk and his girl through the woods? I know it sounds crazy, but it would of worked. Or, and I really like this one, at the end of the movie, after all the pursuing and car crashings, the mean jocks, along with our cute hero and heroine, climb out of their vehicles, which are smashed in a ravine, deep ditch,or something like that, gathers themselves together, wipes off their blood and begins to laugh hysterically while they 'high five' each other.""That was the best one yet!"" one can cheer, while the girl quizzes the boys about the bullets in the gun. Which, as the jock assures her, were fake. And, just as they all decide to 'play the game again', they hear the sound of coming cop cars which sends them off running and laughing like little hoodlums. Yeah. I know it's farfetched and even a little demented (Cronenberg did something similiar like this at the end of 'Crash') it still probably would of worked, (given a few changes throughout the film) This could of been the ultimate twist and prank on the viewer. I even betcha the reviews would of been different. Better, maybe not. Or, maybe so...?But nevertheless, the movie is fine the way it is. Empty, silly and fun. Just like those old drive-in films from yesterday, or better yet, the car chase scene in Tarantino's 'Death Proof'.

792589,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B00013RC4I,Michael Butts,"[4, 6]","The only thing this movie has going for it is its frenetically charged car chases, which make up about 90% of the movie.  Some beautiful Canadian scenery is also a plus.  But the movie which starts out fairly interesting in a ""Duel"" kind of fashion falls apart once we find out who the driver of the mysterious truck is.  The script is so implausible it's hard not to laugh at some of the outrageous things the writers expect us to swallow.  And Danielle Brett as the heroine Sonia is one of the most obnoxious characters to come along in some time.  If I were Casper van Dien (why the orange hair?), I would have thrown her out of the car long before; she does little but criticize, whine, flirt, whine, scream, whine.  There's one scene where he asks her to get him some duct tape; too bad he didn't put it over her mouth!  Poor Catherine Oxenberg (Mrs. van Dien) has as twenty second appearance as a doomed forest ranger.
