209809,A140RUM4ZTOBZD,630021396X,"J. Hensley ""collinwood resident""","[3, 3]","I saw this movie at the cinema when I was 12 years old with an older cousin who got me in to this R rated film.  I have been a movie fanatic since birth and remember that this movie was slammed by critics when it was first released.  Well I loved the movie then and recently I purchased this movie on vhs at a Goodwill store in the town where I live for 25 cents.  30 years later this film is still a delight.  McNichol as tough girl Angel ""Don't let the name fool ya"" Bright clearly gives the best performance over top billed O'Neal as rich girl Ferris Whitney.  And I think, all in all, the film offers a positive message about teen sex because the young girl who actually wins the bet about sleeping with a guy first lies and loses the bet because she is ashamed of what she has done.  Kristy breaks your heart during that scene and was such a pretty and talented young actress.  I loved her when I was 13.  Now for all you ""Sex and the City"" fans the actress who plays Sunshine, the hippy child, is none other than 12 year old Cynthia Nixon, and shes a hoot!!! Matt Dillon is Angel's love interest Randy.  Now this vhs copy I have says it was copyright in 1982 and I have to tell everyone on here that my copy ends with the song ""Let Your Love Flow"" by The Bellamy Brothers and includes the John Lennon song and to my knowledge has all the original music.  I swear!!!  I dont know if maybe the one I bought was its very first release on vhs and the ones all the other people have are later editions or what,  but the music is all the original songs.  Why isn't this on dvd?  Is it because of trouble getting the rights to the music?",3,Little Darlings is still darling!!!,1264204800,"01 23, 2010",2010,1636,"['saw', 'movie', 'cinema', 'when', 'was', '12', 'years', 'old', 'older', 'cousin', 'who', 'got', 'R', 'rated', 'film', 'have', 'been', 'movie', 'fanatic', 'birth', 'remember', 'movie', 'was', 'slammed', 'critics', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'Well', 'loved', 'movie', 'then', 'recently', 'purchased', 'movie', 'vhs', 'Goodwill', 'store', 'town', 'where', 'live', '25', 'cents', '30', 'years', 'later', 'film', 'still', 'delight', 'McNichol', 'tough', 'girl', 'Angel', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'name', 'fool', 'ya', 'Bright', 'clearly', 'best', 'performance', 'top', 'billed', ""O'Neal"", 'rich', 'girl', 'Ferris', 'Whitney', 'think', 'film', 'positive', 'message', 'teen', 'sex', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'actually', 'bet', 'sleeping', 'guy', 'first', 'bet', 'ashamed', 'what', 'done', 'Kristy', 'heart', 'scene', 'was', 'such', 'pretty', 'talented', 'young', 'actress', 'loved', 'when', 'was', '13', 'Now', 'Sex', 'City', 'actress', 'who', 'Sunshine', 'hippy', 'child', 'none', 'other', '12', 'year', 'old', 'Cynthia', 'Nixon', 'hoot', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'Angel', 'love', 'interest', 'Randy', 'Now', 'vhs', 'copy', 'have', 'was', 'copyright', '1982', 'have', 'tell', 'everyone', 'here', 'copy', 'song', 'Let', 'Your', 'Love', 'Flow', 'Bellamy', 'Brothers', 'John', 'Lennon', 'song', 'knowledge', 'original', 'music', 'swear', 'dont', 'know', 'maybe', 'one', 'bought', 'was', 'very', 'first', 'release', 'vhs', 'ones', 'other', 'people', 'have', 'are', 'later', 'editions', 'what', 'music', 'original', 'songs', 'Why', ""n't"", 'dvd', 'trouble', 'getting', 'rights', 'music']",N/A

But they share one similarity: they are both virgins, the only ones of their age in their cabin.Due to pressure from their cabin mates, most specifically the aggressive Cinder Carlson, the two enter into a bet on who will lose their virginity first and by the end of the summer.Ferris, who initially seems more interested in the pursuit of the opposite sex, quickly sets her sights on Gary Callahan, the much older coach at the camp. But Angel finds her own target, namely Randy Adams, an equally streetwise boy attending the camp across the lake.This comedy/drama flick takes me back to memory lane to when I was 7 years old in the 1st grade during its theatrical release in the Spring of 1980 and when it came out on HBO for the very first time in the Summer of 1981.",3,Sexy Darlings,1393977600,"03 5, 2014",2014,1193,"['Fifteen', 'year', 'olds', 'Ferris', 'Whitney', 'Tatum', ""O'Neal"", 'Angel', 'Bright', 'Kristy', 'McNichol', 'meet', 'when', 'attend', 'same', 'summer', 'camp', 'are', 'assigned', 'bunks', 'other', 'same', 'cabin.It', 'hate', 'first', 'sight', 'are', 'seemingly', 'polar', 'opposites', 'romantic', 'literate', 'Ferris', 'wealthy', 'thus', 'privileged', 'background', 'streetwise', 'chain-smoking', 'Angel', 'proverbial', 'wrong', 'side', 'tracks', 'share', 'one', 'similarity', 'are', 'virgins', 'only', 'ones', 'age', 'cabin.Due', 'pressure', 'cabin', 'mates', 'most', 'specifically', 'aggressive', 'Cinder', 'Carlson', 'two', 'enter', 'bet', 'who', 'will', 'lose', 'virginity', 'first', 'end', 'summer.Ferris', 'who', 'initially', 'more', 'interested', 'pursuit', 'opposite', 'sex', 'quickly', 'sights', 'Gary', 'Callahan', 'much', 'older', 'coach', 'camp', 'Angel', 'own', 'target', 'namely', 'Randy', 'Adams', 'equally', 'streetwise', 'boy', 'attending', 'camp', 'lake.This', 'comedy/drama', 'flick', 'back', 'memory', 'lane', 'when', 'was', '7', 'years', 'old', '1st', 'grade', 'theatrical', 'release', 'Spring', '1980', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'HBO', 'very', 'first', 'time', 'Summer', '1981']",N/A

So, if your lucky to come across a copy on VHS grab it as it has become a rare commodity.The storyline is pretty simple in that two teenage girls make a bet at summer camp as to who will lose their virginity. While starring on TV's ""Family"" Kristy McNichol became an Emmy winner and a household name so it was of no surprise that movie studios started sending her scripts. I believe this was the first films she made.
