It's not at all a pleasant picture, though it's highly charged sexually. Nin (played by Maria de Medeiros) comes across as a totally unlikable character, a sensual flake caught up in the erotic; June (Uma Thurman) is not much better, and she's tough and selfish. Miller (Fred Ward) keeps telling Nin that he needs her, but it's hard to tell how or why; it's impossible to tell what Nin wants, if anything at all. What June wants is plain and simple: recognition through Henry's writing, which she feels she never gets. Since Nin was such a sensual, almost ephemeral person in real life and her diary, the scenes with her in them seem to lack substance. For all the commotion the NC-17 rating created because of the explicit sex scenes, it all seems pretty tame today.

Now I go with the former. Henry and June is a real work of art.  And to be released in 1990, proved to be a groundbreaking work. Like Kaufman's Unbearable Lightness of Being, H and J is rich in detail, true to the story and takes you on a passionate and educational journey.People argued that the film was not totally true to what Nin and Miller wote in their diaries, but talking to others who saw the movie, disagreed. The dvd tranfer is excellent, doesn't diminish the cinemtography and the beauty of the film's characters. Having said that...onward to the performances.Uma Thurman's performance continues to be burned in my mind, ever since i saw the movie back in 1990. It was hard to figure how i could describe such a great performance. then, watching it a few times...i figured it out. Simply put, Thurman enbodies June, the way all those method actors from the 50's worked their craft. Memories of Brando (Streetcar), James Dean (Giant) and Montgomery Clift (A Place in the Sun) come to play, discussing Thurman. It should be noted, Thurman has a limited amount of screen time in the story, which makes her all the more fascinating.In other words, it is a work of great craftsmanship and magic. An oscar nomination would have been a  consideration, but of course, the nc 17 rating put an end to all of that. And, truth be told, lesbian sex in a movie, at this time, before the gay lifestyle became chic and accepted in 2011.  But, if anything, it is worth the rental of the film to see Thruman's entrance in the movie. This movie clearly made Thurman a movie star and a craft worker of great measure.The performances of all the other actors also is amazing (seeing that Thurman stands out, though).  Maria de Manois plays Nin with passion and full of the discovery of her quest for more and more. Fred Ward gives the performance of his lifetime, bringing Henry Miller to life, whith machismo and mojo. Richard E Grant and Kevin Spacey bring much humor and support in their roles, as well.A riveting movie, with a story that won't quit with it's genius intact..Henry and June is a must see for anyone who appreciates great theater and great performances.oh, by the way, did i mention Uma Thurman's performance...just kidding.",5,"Uma Thurman,in a performance like Brando and Dean...",1309219200,"06 28, 2011",2011,2380,"['Philip', 'Kaufman', 'brilliant', 'film', 'Henry', 'June', 'had', 'critcs', 'public', 'either', 'praising', 'hills', 'completely', 'confused', 'disappointed', 'Now', 'go', 'former', 'Henry', 'June', 'real', 'work', 'art', 'be', 'released', '1990', 'proved', 'be', 'groundbreaking', 'work', 'Kaufman', 'Unbearable', 'Lightness', 'Being', 'H', 'J', 'rich', 'detail', 'true', 'story', 'passionate', 'educational', 'journey.People', 'argued', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'totally', 'true', 'what', 'Nin', 'Miller', 'wote', 'diaries', 'talking', 'others', 'who', 'saw', 'movie', 'disagreed', 'dvd', 'tranfer', 'excellent', ""n't"", 'diminish', 'cinemtography', 'beauty', 'film', 'characters', 'Having', 'said', 'onward', 'performances.Uma', 'Thurman', 'performance', 'be', 'burned', 'mind', 'ever', 'i', 'saw', 'movie', 'back', '1990', 'was', 'hard', 'figure', 'how', 'i', 'could', 'describe', 'such', 'great', 'performance', 'then', 'watching', 'few', 'times', 'i', 'figured', 'out', 'Simply', 'put', 'Thurman', 'June', 'way', 'method', 'actors', '50', 'worked', 'craft', 'Memories', 'Brando', 'Streetcar', 'James', 'Dean', 'Giant', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'Place', 'Sun', 'come', 'play', 'discussing', 'Thurman', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'Thurman', 'limited', 'amount', 'screen', 'time', 'story', 'more', 'fascinating.In', 'other', 'words', 'work', 'great', 'craftsmanship', 'magic', 'oscar', 'nomination', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'consideration', 'course', 'nc', '17', 'rating', 'put', 'end', 'truth', 'be', 'told', 'lesbian', 'sex', 'movie', 'time', 'gay', 'lifestyle', 'became', 'chic', 'accepted', '2011', 'anything', 'rental', 'film', 'see', 'Thruman', 'entrance', 'movie', 'movie', 'clearly', 'made', 'Thurman', 'movie', 'star', 'craft', 'worker', 'great', 'measure.The', 'performances', 'other', 'actors', 'also', 'amazing', 'seeing', 'Thurman', 'out', 'though', 'Maria', 'Manois', 'Nin', 'passion', 'full', 'discovery', 'quest', 'more', 'more', 'Fred', 'Ward', 'performance', 'lifetime', 'bringing', 'Henry', 'Miller', 'life', 'whith', 'machismo', 'mojo', 'Richard', 'E', 'Grant', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'bring', 'much', 'humor', 'support', 'roles', 'well.A', 'riveting', 'movie', 'story', 'wo', ""n't"", 'quit', 'genius', 'intact..Henry', 'June', 'must', 'see', 'anyone', 'who', 'great', 'theater', 'great', 'performances.oh', 'way', 'did', 'i', 'mention', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'performance', 'just', 'kidding']",N/A

I didn't get through it the 2nd time, not even for laughs.  And I thought I had been at fault!Acting 101.  Scriptwriting 101.  This is a massive cliche in motion that shows an abysmally puerile portrayal of the 'bohemian life'.  Everything about it betrays a freshman college (change that to freshman high school) understanding of the subject matter.  It would be hilarious if it wasn't so depressing to see that work like this got a major release.  The embarrassment is too much.I should explain just how the pathetic acting and risible slogan-lines collide to create this beyond-belief garbage, but as with the previous reviewer, I was almost left speechless too.  Fred Ward's performance, in particular, is so rudimentary and desperate to persuade, that at times it feels like he's slipped into parody mode.(Ever wonder why he never got a lead role again?)I see this film has gotten rave reviews by many others, and I can only think that this may be due to youthful impressionability.  If you haven't seen/read much about liberation from sexual and conventional mores, you may be forgiven for believing this flick is IT.

I was a University graduate in Chemical Engineering, but he did not warn me about the content. I had never seen two women kissing. So, when the Lesbian scenes came on the screen, I hid my eyes until he told me it was over.Now as a mature woman, with more literature and experience under my belt, I highly recommend this movie, if you have a high libido. Initially I was unaware that Henry was Henry Miller, a writer.  That still did not ring a bell.  It was not until my Neurologist told me that Henry Miller was an ex-patriate in France circa 1917.  He lived on the streets, frequented the whore houses, and stayed with friends whenever possible.  His wife, June, was a social worker back in Brooklyn, New York. Eventually, Henry Miller's novels would be published in Europe (first in France); however, it would not until the sixties in America that a landmark case on obscenity released his novels for publication.About 1930, Anais Nin, a wealthy woman, whose husband Hugo, was a writer in her own right and was working on a project about D.H. Lawrence.  Her husband was a banker, and she found his crowd boring.  So he found Henry Miller and a friend of his and brought him to dinner.  This is how their friendship and affair began.Anais met June on the few times she visited France.  This was how she began her affair with June.  I think she was also having an incestuous relationship with a male cousin who was madly in love with her.Anais wrote the book Henry and June, and asked that it not be published until Hugo's death.I liked the cinematography and the acting.  I wondered why people did not make mention of Uma Thurman playing this role when she became famous - you cannot fake kissing another woman on screen. The movie was edgy and old looking.

63765,A27CFNHYZG6WS8,0783230559,darragh o'donoghue,"[25, 45]","For all its notoriously explicit subject matter - the story of an affair between two famous writers on sexuality, Anais Nin and Henry Miller, the film features many heterosexual and lesbian couplings, mini-orgies, screenings of period pornography, scenes in bordellos etc. - 'Henry And June' doesn't further the Hollywood biopic beyond the reductive absurdities of the 1930s and 40s.  Throughout, the film's grinding (DEFINITELY no pun intended) and endless 130 minutes, I was irresistably reminded of the mythically silly Curtis Bernhardt film about the Brontes, 'Devotion' (1946), which featured the classic exchange: 'Hello, Dickens'; 'Hello, Thackeray'.  Kaufman's film groans with moments like these, not just in the introduction of characters - 'This is my friend, the writer Henry Miller...he'll never be published' - but in the way locals greet the bohemian leads ('Bonjour, Mussyuur Meelur' 'Sah vah?'); the way intellectual discussion is reduced to crass platitudes; the telegraphed reminders of cultural or historical signposts (a screening of 'L'Age D'Or' with mild heckling; Hitler bleating on the radio); the dopey use of literal montage (Nin and Miller making love while a pot bubbles, or Hugo plucks the guitar).Anais Nin was arguably the first major writer to ask for writing, especially writing about sex, to be written for and by women, from a woman's point of view and experience, rather than having to make do with the usual hand-me-down male fantasies.The film tries to show this gap between male and female ways of looking, not only by setting up spectacles in which we concentrate on the voyeurs of each sex, and the different way they react to what they see; but in offering two paralell, gendered narratives.  The male story centres on Miller's attempt to write 'Tropic Of Cancer': it is a masculine, linear narrative, which starts with Henry as a hopeless, uncomprehending boor, and ends with the completed manuscript - in other words, a closed narrative leading to quantifiable achievement.  Nin's female narrative is more concerned with savouring and analysing every moment, mixing fantasy, dream and reality - although this narrative supposedly charts her development from curious, child-like bourgeois to sexually experienced woman, Nin teaches Miller more than he can ever give her.  This difference is shown in the film by the way her major writing is her Journal, open, unplanned, plotless, a work that can only end with her death.The major problem is that Kaufman doesn't dramatise this opposition.  He is only concerned with creating atmosphere, a bogus image of a non-existent France in which amiable peasants play musette, do magic tricks and loiter in the streets; in which orgiastic carnivals drum through the night, and brothels cater to every taste.  There is no sense of the deep divisions at the time in France between Right and Left that would lead to the trauma of the Occupation - the protest at the Bunuel film is easily laughed down, whereas in real life it was subjected to fascist vandalism; the policemen are so amiable as to allow themslves be swallowed by the bohemian fun.  There is no attempt to account, for example for what it might be truly like to be a prostitute in such a milieu, shorn of the fantasy - these girls have no life beyond their professional duties.  The vapid decor and soft-focus cinematography smothers everything in a smooth glow that makes a delapidated tenement as salubrious as a rich banker's mansion.  And isn't it a bit off that Nin, one of the leading feminist thinkers of the 20th century, is redcued to being a bad poet of the erotic, and a simperingly infantile one at that (there is little mention of how poor and monotonous a writer Miller truly was - June mockingly compares him to Dostoevsky, but Thurman's performance is so lamentable it doesn't count as a critique).  What really exposes this film as a sham is its unimaginative treatment of sexuality - in lingering over naked female flesh, and especially in the soft-porn sapphic grappling, the film ignores Nin's plea and addresses itself to male voyeurs the world over.",1,As interesting as reading Henry Miller.,1014595200,"02 25, 2002",2002,4117,"['notoriously', 'explicit', 'subject', 'matter', 'story', 'affair', 'two', 'famous', 'writers', 'sexuality', 'Anais', 'Nin', 'Henry', 'Miller', 'film', 'many', 'heterosexual', 'lesbian', 'couplings', 'mini-orgies', 'screenings', 'period', 'pornography', 'scenes', 'bordellos', 'etc', ""'Henry"", 'June', ""n't"", 'further', 'Hollywood', 'biopic', 'reductive', 'absurdities', '1930s', '40s', 'Throughout', 'film', 'grinding', 'DEFINITELY', 'pun', 'intended', '130', 'minutes', 'was', 'irresistably', 'reminded', 'mythically', 'silly', 'Curtis', 'Bernhardt', 'film', 'Brontes', ""'Devotion"", '1946', 'featured', 'classic', 'exchange', ""'Hello"", 'Dickens', ""'Hello"", 'Thackeray', 'Kaufman', 'film', 'groans', 'moments', 'not', 'just', 'introduction', 'characters', ""'This"", 'friend', 'writer', 'Henry', 'Miller', ""'ll"", 'never', 'be', 'published', 'way', 'greet', 'bohemian', 'leads', ""'Bonjour"", 'Mussyuur', 'Meelur', 'vah', 'way', 'intellectual', 'discussion', 'reduced', 'crass', 'platitudes', 'telegraphed', 'reminders', 'cultural', 'historical', 'signposts', 'screening', ""L'Age"", ""D'Or"", 'mild', 'heckling', 'Hitler', 'bleating', 'radio', 'dopey', 'use', 'literal', 'montage', 'Nin', 'Miller', 'making', 'love', 'pot', 'Hugo', 'guitar', '.Anais', 'Nin', 'was', 'arguably', 'first', 'major', 'writer', 'ask', 'writing', 'especially', 'writing', 'sex', 'be', 'written', 'women', 'woman', 'point', 'view', 'experience', 'rather', 'having', 'make', 'do', 'usual', 'hand-me-down', 'male', 'fantasies.The', 'film', 'tries', 'show', 'gap', 'male', 'female', 'ways', 'looking', 'not', 'only', 'setting', 'up', 'spectacles', 'concentrate', 'voyeurs', 'sex', 'different', 'way', 'react', 'what', 'see', 'offering', 'two', 'paralell', 'gendered', 'narratives', 'male', 'story', 'centres', 'Miller', 'attempt', 'write', ""'Tropic"", 'Cancer', 'masculine', 'linear', 'narrative', 'Henry', 'hopeless', 'uncomprehending', 'boor', 'completed', 'manuscript', 'other', 'words', 'closed', 'narrative', 'leading', 'quantifiable', 'achievement', 'Nin', 'female', 'narrative', 'more', 'concerned', 'savouring', 'analysing', 'moment', 'mixing', 'fantasy', 'dream', 'reality', 'narrative', 'supposedly', 'development', 'curious', 'child-like', 'bourgeois', 'sexually', 'experienced', 'woman', 'Nin', 'Miller', 'more', 'can', 'ever', 'give', 'difference', 'shown', 'film', 'way', 'major', 'writing', 'Journal', 'open', 'unplanned', 'plotless', 'work', 'can', 'only', 'end', 'death.The', 'major', 'problem', 'Kaufman', ""n't"", 'dramatise', 'opposition', 'only', 'concerned', 'creating', 'atmosphere', 'bogus', 'image', 'non-existent', 'France', 'amiable', 'peasants', 'play', 'musette', 'do', 'magic', 'tricks', 'loiter', 'streets', 'orgiastic', 'carnivals', 'drum', 'night', 'brothels', 'cater', 'taste', 'sense', 'deep', 'divisions', 'time', 'France', 'Right', 'Left', 'would', 'lead', 'trauma', 'Occupation', 'protest', 'Bunuel', 'film', 'easily', 'laughed', 'down', 'whereas', 'real', 'life', 'was', 'subjected', 'fascist', 'vandalism', 'policemen', 'are', 'so', 'amiable', 'allow', 'themslves', 'be', 'swallowed', 'bohemian', 'fun', 'attempt', 'account', 'example', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'truly', 'be', 'prostitute', 'such', 'milieu', 'shorn', 'fantasy', 'girls', 'have', 'life', 'professional', 'duties', 'vapid', 'decor', 'soft-focus', 'cinematography', 'smothers', 'everything', 'smooth', 'glow', 'delapidated', 'tenement', 'as', 'salubrious', 'rich', 'banker', 'mansion', ""n't"", 'bit', 'off', 'Nin', 'one', 'leading', 'feminist', 'thinkers', '20th', 'century', 'redcued', 'being', 'bad', 'poet', 'erotic', 'simperingly', 'infantile', 'one', 'little', 'mention', 'how', 'poor', 'monotonous', 'writer', 'Miller', 'truly', 'was', 'June', 'mockingly', 'Dostoevsky', 'Thurman', 'performance', 'so', 'lamentable', ""n't"", 'count', 'critique', 'What', 'really', 'film', 'sham', 'unimaginative', 'treatment', 'sexuality', 'lingering', 'over', 'naked', 'female', 'flesh', 'especially', 'soft-porn', 'sapphic', 'grappling', 'film', 'Nin', 'plea', 'male', 'world']",N/A

They were sophisticated women who led  lives decidedly different and more daring than my careful existence, and  writers who told the world about their affairs. Today, their writing may  seem tame, (Colette wrote &quot;Gigi&quot;) but it was shocking a few years  ago. Nin's diaries are still pretty steamy.The film, based on Nin's  diaries, recalls the period when Anais (Anna eess') and her husband lived  in Paris and became acquainted with Henry Miller and his wife June. Henry  Miller may seem retro today, but there was a time when his steamy  &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot; was 'Banned in Boston' (according to my mother  who had a copy hidden where my father wouldn't look). Miler was writing  &quot;The Tropic of Cancer&quot; when he knew Nin.I saw &quot;Henry  and June&quot; in the theater several years ago and bought the DVD. This is  a very well done film--and very beautiful--Paris in 1931. (I keep it  stashed with &quot;Sex, Lies, and Videotapes&quot; which is tame by  comparison.) I also wanted the film because Kevin Spacey is in it.Maria  de Mederios plays Nin to perfection. Richard Grant plays her husband who  seems willing to go along with anything that will improve her writing. Fred  Ward and Uma Thurman play Henry and June. Thurman's acting is better in  this movie than in &quot;Pulp Fiction.&quot; Spacey plays a writer who is  part of the writer's network, and has some funny scenes.The movie has a  lot of sex on screen. There is so much sex I found myself laughing after  awhile. The characters seem to live for the erotic. I say &quot;seem  to&quot; because it is never clear to me how much of their behavior is  driven by erotic desire and how much is driven by a desire to run back and  write it down in their diaries and books.  The story definitely contains a  'tongue-in-cheek' element.Nin revealed the story to the world after all  the characters were dead, so we'll never know how much was fact and how  much fiction.",5,A beautiful erotic film..,960768000,"06 12, 2000",2000,2064,"['When', 'was', 'mid-thirties', 'read', 'book', 'Anais', 'Nin', 'Collette', 'wrote', 'enjoyed', 'immensely', 'were', 'sophisticated', 'women', 'who', 'led', 'lives', 'decidedly', 'different', 'more', 'daring', 'careful', 'existence', 'writers', 'who', 'told', 'world', 'affairs', 'Today', 'writing', 'may', 'seem', 'tame', 'Colette', 'wrote', 'quot', 'Gigi', 'quot', 'was', 'shocking', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'Nin', 'diaries', 'are', 'still', 'pretty', 'steamy.The', 'film', 'based', 'Nin', 'diaries', 'period', 'when', 'Anais', 'Anna', 'eess', 'husband', 'lived', 'Paris', 'became', 'acquainted', 'Henry', 'Miller', 'wife', 'June', 'Henry', 'Miller', 'may', 'seem', 'retro', 'today', 'there', 'was', 'time', 'when', 'steamy', 'quot', 'Tropic', 'Cancer', 'quot', 'was', ""'Banned"", 'Boston', 'according', 'mother', 'who', 'had', 'copy', 'hidden', 'where', 'father', 'would', ""n't"", 'look', 'Miler', 'was', 'writing', 'quot', 'Tropic', 'Cancer', 'quot', 'when', 'knew', 'Nin.I', 'saw', 'quot', 'Henry', 'June', 'quot', 'theater', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'bought', 'DVD', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'film', 'very', 'beautiful', 'Paris', '1931', 'keep', 'stashed', 'quot', 'Sex', 'Lies', 'Videotapes', 'quot', 'tame', 'comparison', 'also', 'wanted', 'film', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'it.Maria', 'Mederios', 'Nin', 'perfection', 'Richard', 'Grant', 'husband', 'who', 'willing', 'go', 'along', 'anything', 'will', 'improve', 'writing', 'Fred', 'Ward', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'play', 'Henry', 'June', 'Thurman', 'acting', 'better', 'movie', 'quot', 'Pulp', 'Fiction.', 'quot', 'Spacey', 'writer', 'who', 'part', 'writer', 'network', 'funny', 'scenes.The', 'movie', 'lot', 'sex', 'screen', 'so', 'much', 'sex', 'found', 'laughing', 'awhile', 'characters', 'seem', 'live', 'erotic', 'say', 'quot', 'seem', 'quot', 'never', 'clear', 'how', 'much', 'behavior', 'driven', 'erotic', 'desire', 'how', 'much', 'driven', 'desire', 'run', 'back', 'write', 'down', 'diaries', 'books', 'story', 'definitely', ""'tongue-in-cheek"", 'element.Nin', 'revealed', 'story', 'world', 'characters', 'were', 'dead', ""'ll"", 'never', 'know', 'how', 'much', 'was', 'fact', 'how', 'much', 'fiction']",N/A

It tells  an interesting story that concerns  the famous and scandalous American writer Henry Miller during  the period of work on his first major work,  ""Tropic of Cancer"" in 1931 in Paris and two women without whom the book would not have happened. One of them is  his wife, June Miller, who is a constant presence  under the different names in all Miller's works. The other - Henry's  (and June's) close friend, lover,  and confidant, Anais Nin. The film is an adaptation or mediation over the  Anais Nin's journal which she wrote for 60 years and described in it the intimate details her inner world, including experiences with sexuality, and the meetings and relationships with prominent bohemian personalities  of literature and art, who came from around the world to  Paris, always known as the Mecca for creative individuals. Nin said about her life long writing in diary, ""This diary is my kief, hashish, and opium pipe. This is my drug and my vice."" Anais met in Paris provincial but talented non-conformist Miller and his exotic, sensual, and  irresistible wife June (Uma Thurman never looked so attractive, as in this movie) and began affairs  with both of them that would change their lives and influence enormously both Miller's and Nin's literary work.  Anais is also known and praised as one of the first and the finest female writers of erotica. One of the reasons for film's success was director/writer Philip Kaufman's ability  to delicately transfer to the screen the erotic  intense atmosphere of Nin's writing as well as the spirit of Bohemian Paris in the beginning of the 1930s.At the  of Anais' request,  her journal was published only after the death of all the participants in the events. Anais' relationship with Henry and June, which led to her own realization as writer,  served as the basis for the  Philip Kaufman's film.  Kaufman  wrote the script together with his wife Rose, and made a brilliant, disturbing, outrageous  film, which had made history by  having been the first USA  film to receive the NR-17 Rating, so called ""kiss of death"". Henry and June is an adult film in the literal meaning of this word, it is the movie made for adults which  explores in the insightful, exiting and artistic way the motivations, inspirations,  and desires of the famous figures of  Art. The acting is universally good with terrific  Maria de Medeiros  as Anais Nin. It is impossible to take one's eyes off her face - so charming, lovely, and desirable she is. She possesses  the power  of commanding the screen and she is the best thing in the movie which belongs to her Anais Nin.",4,"Anas Nin: ""Something is always born of excess...",1224374400,"10 19, 2008",2008,2907,"['great', 'art', 'was', 'born', 'great', 'terror', 'great', 'loneliness', 'great', 'inhibitions', 'instabilities', 'always', 'Henry', 'June', '1990', 'Philip', 'Kaufman', 'based', 'book', 'Anais', 'Nin', 'wonderful', 'film', 'rare', 'admirable', 'example', 'how', 'art-house', 'erotic', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'made', 'interesting', 'story', 'famous', 'scandalous', 'American', 'writer', 'Henry', 'Miller', 'period', 'work', 'first', 'major', 'work', 'Tropic', 'Cancer', '1931', 'Paris', 'two', 'women', 'whom', 'book', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'happened', 'One', 'wife', 'June', 'Miller', 'who', 'constant', 'presence', 'different', 'names', 'Miller', 'works', 'other', 'Henry', 'June', 'close', 'friend', 'lover', 'confidant', 'Anais', 'Nin', 'film', 'adaptation', 'mediation', 'Anais', 'Nin', 'journal', 'wrote', '60', 'years', 'described', 'intimate', 'details', 'inner', 'world', 'including', 'experiences', 'sexuality', 'meetings', 'relationships', 'prominent', 'bohemian', 'personalities', 'literature', 'art', 'who', 'came', 'world', 'Paris', 'always', 'known', 'Mecca', 'creative', 'individuals', 'Nin', 'said', 'life', 'long', 'writing', 'diary', 'diary', 'kief', 'hashish', 'opium', 'pipe', 'drug', 'vice', 'Anais', 'met', 'Paris', 'provincial', 'talented', 'non-conformist', 'Miller', 'exotic', 'sensual', 'irresistible', 'wife', 'June', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'never', 'looked', 'so', 'attractive', 'movie', 'began', 'affairs', 'would', 'change', 'lives', 'influence', 'enormously', 'Miller', 'Nin', 'literary', 'work', 'Anais', 'also', 'known', 'praised', 'one', 'first', 'finest', 'female', 'writers', 'erotica', 'One', 'reasons', 'film', 'success', 'was', 'director/writer', 'Philip', 'Kaufman', 'ability', 'delicately', 'transfer', 'screen', 'erotic', 'intense', 'atmosphere', 'Nin', 'writing', 'as', 'well', 'spirit', 'Bohemian', 'Paris', 'beginning', '1930s.At', 'Anais', 'request', 'journal', 'was', 'published', 'only', 'death', 'participants', 'events', 'Anais', 'relationship', 'Henry', 'June', 'led', 'own', 'realization', 'writer', 'served', 'basis', 'Philip', 'Kaufman', 'film', 'Kaufman', 'wrote', 'script', 'together', 'wife', 'Rose', 'made', 'brilliant', 'disturbing', 'outrageous', 'film', 'had', 'made', 'history', 'having', 'been', 'first', 'USA', 'film', 'receive', 'NR-17', 'Rating', 'so', 'called', 'kiss', 'death', 'Henry', 'June', 'adult', 'film', 'literal', 'meaning', 'word', 'movie', 'made', 'adults', 'insightful', 'exiting', 'artistic', 'way', 'motivations', 'inspirations', 'desires', 'famous', 'figures', 'Art', 'acting', 'universally', 'good', 'terrific', 'Maria', 'de', 'Medeiros', 'Anais', 'Nin', 'impossible', 'take', 'one', 'eyes', 'face', 'so', 'charming', 'lovely', 'desirable', 'power', 'commanding', 'screen', 'best', 'thing', 'movie', 'Anais', 'Nin']",N/A

I am a major admirer of Henry Miller and Anais Nin, and this film is very accurate in the depictions of them.  It's also one of the rare examples of an American director (in this case Philip Kaufman) making an erotic picture that's mature, intelligent, and serious about sex.  Most sex in American pictures is played for laughs.  It's almost as if Americans (and American filmmakers) are deathly afraid of it.  Sure, there's a lot of smutty talk in films and TV, but it's not erotic, not intelligent, and it's more on the level of a 6th grader.  Kaufman is the only one who has made some great erotic films (this one and The Unbearable Lightness of Being) that can stand up to the best Europe has given us.  This film is a great film, showing Miller's struggle in finding his voice in Paris, and Anais Nin's support of his writing and her affair with him.  The period flavour is wonderful, and the performances are first rate.  Fred Ward (whatever happened to him?) gives a great performance as Henry Miller, and Maria de Mederos gives a lovely performance as Anais Nin.  Uma Thurman is quite engaging as June Miller, Henry's estranged and very temptuous wife.  Kevin Spacey has a small but effective role as one of Henry's writing friends.  This was the first film to officially receive the ""evil"" NC-17 rating, and I wish that rating didn't have such a stigma over it.  Adults have a right to see films aimed at adults.

The much talked-about erotic elements and explicit sex scenes that caused the MPAA to create the now useless NC-17 rating are actually well integrated into the film and actually work to create better understandings of the 3 principle characters through their sexual behaviors and practices. The film isn't all sex like some people think, but when the erotic elements rear their head; the intensity and focus of these scenes throw people off kilter.Overall this is a fantastic film that drags just a little bit near the beginning and end, but is perfectly acted and stunningly filmed.

63776,A75MSQQ3LN86Z,0783230559,Josef Bush,"[1, 1]","I don't intend to burden either of us with my ideas about Anias Nin or Henry Miller's art and methods, or their lives together, or their careeers.  I went through my Sex-As-Personal-Liberation phase several decades ago, read their work, and my opinion of their efforts, in particular, both carnal and literary, are not enthusiastic.  However, this film is a good one in that it is very nearly a ""You Are There"" recreation of Paris Between the Two Wars, and that in itself is worthwhile.  Lots of time-specific nuggets of the real stuff, including snatches of ""J'ai deux amours"" in the earliest recorded version, with Jo Baker's unmistakable voice, street songs and carnival behavior, as well as little montage-like glimpses of Man Ray and his photographs.  The exteriors of buildings, streets and courtyards of The Quarter are shown (not much changed even now) as well as the cramped, medieval interiors; but not a glimpse of the terrifying interior plumbing.  For that you'll have to see Bill Murray's THE RAZOR'S EDGE, another great literary/historical recreation, though fictional.But as good an historical recreatin of an eara as this movie is, with an exceptionally interesting actress Maria di Madiernos playing Anias Nin, and even our Kevin Spacey somewhere in the mix, nothing is evenly remotely as interesting as Uma Thurman's incredible tour de force as June, Miller's ex-taxi-dance hall wife and emotional and financial support during the lean years of his early career.  As an actress on film, Thurman is always at least interesting to look at, for as Merle Streep said of her, ""She is six foot tall, extremely beautiful and supremely talented.""  She is so secure in her sexuality, she is comfortable in homosexual and heterosexual roles.  She is alternately graceful and powerful, as needed, whenever and however called for, and can summon up emotional power in whatever amount and whichever degree as may be required.  We can take that for granted whenever we pay to look at one of her films.  Here, in HENRY AND JUNE however, she demonstrates something I was completely unprepared for; her vocal abilities and in particular, her use of diction.  Understand; HENRY AND  JUNE is filmed in English, with only tiny snippets of French, as needed.  What struck or didn't strike me, at first, is that Uma plays her role speaking in the flat, uninflected Brooklynese of the original woman throughout, without the tiniest lapse.  (I mistook it for bad acting, or laziness.)  But watching and listening more carefully, it came to me that in order to catch the poignance of Clara Bow's performances, I had to imagine Clara's own Brooklyn, working-class voice.  Uma played June as sounding, and therefore being, or appearing, utterly COMMON.  Utterly American.  That is the key to her sexual appeal, and it is the key to Nin's fascination with her.  Nin's view of her, of Henry and their literary efforts, is an aristocrat's view, and her erotic interest in June, is tied to her condesention.  (Nin's Diary is all about slumming.)  June is the new, independent and unencumbered woman, with her own erotic and emotional destiny, and Nin wants to become that woman.The urgency of sex in the face of doom:  This tiny aspect of the story characterizes most of it (most of Henry and Anias' copulative drama) as well as most of the turmoil of the age, in Europe.  It is no secret that Orwell, working in the same Parisian neighborhood, was writing exactly contemporaneously and that Nin, Miller and Orwell were primarily self-obsessed diarists.  Proust was alive and working too, as well as Gide, yet another diarist.  Their Paris was exactly what you'd expect in a culture on the verge of suicide, in which more than half the male population of the leading European nations died on the battlefields of WW I.  Naturally the brothels were filled with poor, lonely young women with no possible way of making a living or of making family.  With European social presumptions about personal behavior in ruins, unsecure men and women fornicated in the streets, or wherever impulse found them.  And the ""American Girl"" of the Cinema, who turns up as a character in Satie's ballet PARADE, became a kind of an erotic archtype.  Mary Pickford, Clara Bow, Louise Brooks and others, typified a kind of ""cheap"" new and easily available sensuality that seemed to be inevitable; something akin to Chanel's #5, the first popular synthetic female essence, or her inimitable, all-purpose ""Little Black Dress"" which was her version of Henry Ford's Model T.  Somehow, Thurmon apparently managed to absorb everything the characters and their circumstances offered, and to embody it on screen, and miraculously she is able to transform and then display it as the original character might have done, with seeming effortlessness.This may not be the performance of her lifetime, but for students of film, this may be the performance of our lifetime.

63780,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,0783230559,Linda Linguvic,"[100, 104]","This 1990 film, directed by Philip Kaufman, is set in Paris in 1931.  This was  a time and place between the two world wars that attracted writers and artists to a bohemian lifestyle, a time of discarding old conventions and embracing experimentation.  Here, Henry Miller, an American expatriate wrote his wildly erotic books, which were banned in the United States.  And Anais Nin, known for her extensive diaries about her sensory experiences, began her literary career here.  It's no wonder that the two of them would meet and couple.  They were both married at the time and this film is about the complex relationships between Henry, Anais, and their respective mates, all searching of a kind of liberation which was endemic at the time.Fred Ward plays Henry as a crass American with a Brooklyn accent that makes native New Yorkers, such as myself, cringe.  He's all man though and it's easy to see why Anais Nin, played by the large-eyed petite Portuguese actress Maria de Medereiros, is attracted to him.  Her own husband, Richard E. Grant, is attractive as well, and it's clear that they have a good romantic life together, but he's willing to look the other way at his wife's desire for others.  When Miller's wife, June, played by Uma Thurman, a fiery androgynous mother-earth figure, comes on the scene, Anais Nin  finds herself attracted to her as well.  This sets the scene for some interesting complexities.The video is two hours and 16 minutes long and I expected to watch only half of it one evening and the rest of it the next night.  However, from the moment it started I was completely captured by the story and just had to watch it all the way through.  The cinematography is so good that it was even nominated for an academy award, not for just the excellent views of Paris, but for the way the intimate scenes are done which manage to convey the relationships and the sensualities of the moment while avoiding being explicit.  The focus is on the romance and the concepts rather than the physical acts. This kept the scenes erotic and it also moved the story forward.  I was totally intrigued and kept wondering what would happen next.The acting was uniformly good, but special note goes to Maria de Medeiros who played Anais Nin.  As she works primarily in French films, I had never seen her before.  She uses her huge dark eyes and facial expresses so well, that just a glance conveys layers of meaning.  She's the focal point of every scene, in spite of the larger and more voluptuous Uma Thurman.  And that's exactly what the director intended.Some might find this film slow as the drama and tension is just about the people, not about world events or outside influence. However, it manages to create a time and a place and people that influenced the literary world as well as the mores of future generations.",5,Captures the endemic seach for liberation  in 1930's Paris,1035590400,"10 26, 2002",2002,2834,"['1990', 'film', 'directed', 'Philip', 'Kaufman', 'set', 'Paris', '1931', 'was', 'time', 'place', 'two', 'world', 'wars', 'attracted', 'writers', 'artists', 'bohemian', 'lifestyle', 'time', 'discarding', 'old', 'conventions', 'embracing', 'experimentation', 'Here', 'Henry', 'Miller', 'American', 'expatriate', 'wrote', 'wildly', 'erotic', 'books', 'were', 'banned', 'United', 'States', 'Anais', 'Nin', 'known', 'extensive', 'diaries', 'sensory', 'experiences', 'began', 'literary', 'career', 'here', 'wonder', 'two', 'would', 'meet', 'couple', 'were', 'married', 'time', 'film', 'complex', 'relationships', 'Henry', 'Anais', 'respective', 'mates', 'searching', 'kind', 'liberation', 'was', 'endemic', 'time.Fred', 'Ward', 'Henry', 'crass', 'American', 'Brooklyn', 'accent', 'native', 'New', 'Yorkers', 'such', 'cringe', 'man', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'Anais', 'Nin', 'played', 'large-eyed', 'petite', 'Portuguese', 'actress', 'Maria', 'Medereiros', 'attracted', 'own', 'husband', 'Richard', 'E.', 'Grant', 'attractive', 'as', 'well', 'clear', 'have', 'good', 'romantic', 'life', 'together', 'willing', 'look', 'other', 'way', 'wife', 'desire', 'others', 'When', 'Miller', 'wife', 'June', 'played', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'fiery', 'androgynous', 'mother-earth', 'figure', 'scene', 'Anais', 'Nin', 'attracted', 'as', 'well', 'scene', 'interesting', 'complexities.The', 'video', 'two', 'hours', '16', 'minutes', 'long', 'expected', 'watch', 'only', 'half', 'one', 'evening', 'rest', 'next', 'night', 'However', 'moment', 'started', 'was', 'completely', 'captured', 'story', 'just', 'had', 'watch', 'way', 'cinematography', 'so', 'good', 'was', 'even', 'nominated', 'academy', 'award', 'not', 'just', 'excellent', 'views', 'Paris', 'way', 'intimate', 'scenes', 'are', 'done', 'manage', 'convey', 'relationships', 'sensualities', 'moment', 'avoiding', 'being', 'explicit', 'focus', 'romance', 'concepts', 'rather', 'physical', 'acts', 'kept', 'scenes', 'erotic', 'also', 'moved', 'story', 'forward', 'was', 'totally', 'intrigued', 'kept', 'wondering', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'next.The', 'acting', 'was', 'uniformly', 'good', 'special', 'note', 'Maria', 'de', 'Medeiros', 'who', 'played', 'Anais', 'Nin', 'primarily', 'French', 'films', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'before', 'huge', 'dark', 'eyes', 'facial', 'expresses', 'so', 'well', 'just', 'glance', 'conveys', 'layers', 'meaning', 'focal', 'point', 'scene', 'spite', 'larger', 'more', 'voluptuous', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'exactly', 'what', 'director', 'intended.Some', 'might', 'find', 'film', 'slow', 'drama', 'tension', 'just', 'people', 'not', 'world', 'events', 'outside', 'influence', 'However', 'create', 'time', 'place', 'people', 'influenced', 'literary', 'world', 'as', 'well', 'mores', 'future', 'generations']",N/A
63781,ABE8YHLYSM15G,0783230559,Luke Killion,"[0, 0]","""Henry and June"" is a solid take on the love triangle that developed between aspiring author Henry Miller, his wife June and French modernist Anais Nin. I am currently reading a biography of Miller and I found that this movie does alot for the imagination in terms of charcter development in the sordid underbelly of Bohemian Paris in the 1930's. One of Miller's strong points as an author, which is also considered very controversial, is his graphic take on intimate sexual relations.Miller became known as a decadent and some might say perverse pervayer of pornography, as his novels were banned in every English speaking country until 1961. The fact of Miller's complexities and vesatility as a human being is often overlooked made his mainstream success come late in life.  Needless to say there are scenes of graphic sexuality (which are also portrayed in this film) in his work, yet in most of his books it appears like it would in real life for any active man (with the exception of ""Tropic of Cancer""), but where a normal book or movie might hold back, Miller pulls a classic kiss and tell all.  Grant it, Miller was definately ahead of his time in terms of sexual theories and practice of varying forms of intimacy, but beneath his bohemian persona, existed a fairly typical man of the ""Lost Generation"" who hailed from a middle class German American family from Brooklyn.In this film directed by Philip Kaufman, Fred Ward plays a likeable yet gruff Miller character, who I thought at times seemed to emphasize the street smart New York hustler side of Henry rather than the sentimental spiritualist. In Miller's writing, metaphysical and philosophical tangents  align perfectly with his sex scenes and he transcends mere brutishness while retaining a thinking man's sense of virility. This is obviously not an easy aspect to get on film, but Ward does an admirable job and his general appearance and voice match that of the bald and gravelly voiced middle aged yet energetic Miller.The screenplay was done by Kaufman and his wife Rose, which I thought added a nice touch to show both gender perspectives and how this tricky experimental sexuality functioned on several levels, but primarily on the artisic one.  The dialogue is very consistent with the information pertaining to Miller's life and doesn't seemed to be altered to make a more commerical film. After all, to do that would be a rather shoddy appreciation of the classic starving artist who was pertetually short of money and used his New York charm to get what he needed from people while giving them a ""real life experience.""The character of Anais Nin, played by Maria de Medeiros is a spot on match physically and mentally; the entire production was researched incredibly well and obviously made this movie with equal desires to put Miller's words to the screen as to make a profit from his ""personal mythology."" This screenplay was based on Nin's ficticious memoir of the wild nights in Paris, so it is essentially her story. She begins the movie as a French aristocrat with an open minded yet sweetly naive American husband, who seems to understand and faciliate her sexual needs after meeting Henry and June Miller through Miller's roomate, Robert Osborn, played by Kevin Spacey in one of his earlier roles. Nin's character is somewhat of a sexual novice who after writing a book on D.H. Lawrence, is extremely curious about sexual exploration. Some of which she does discover is disturbing as it is pleasurable, mainly through the character of June played by Uma Thurman. Her take on June Miller was the highlight of the movie for me, as in the literature she is the somewhat enigmatic Mona, but the Thurman and Ward team show that beneath the artistic bohemian posturing, exists two street hustling hyper sexual New Yorkers.  I also noticed that Thurman and de Medeiros would go on to play the main female leads in Quentin Tarrantino's ""Pulp Fiction"", four years after this movie. Their screen chemistry is quite memorable and shows the wildness and decadence that was ""all the rage"" back in the 1920's and 30's, and in ""Henry and June"" there exists the prototype for free love ex-pat community in France, which became one of the driving forces in Western art during the 20th century.",3,Uncensored story of Henry Miller's expatriate days of hedonism,1341446400,"07 5, 2012",2012,4264,"['Henry', 'June', 'solid', 'take', 'love', 'triangle', 'developed', 'aspiring', 'author', 'Henry', 'Miller', 'wife', 'June', 'French', 'modernist', 'Anais', 'Nin', 'am', 'currently', 'reading', 'biography', 'Miller', 'found', 'movie', 'alot', 'imagination', 'terms', 'charcter', 'development', 'sordid', 'underbelly', 'Bohemian', 'Paris', '1930', 'One', 'Miller', 'strong', 'points', 'author', 'also', 'considered', 'very', 'controversial', 'graphic', 'take', 'intimate', 'sexual', 'relations.Miller', 'became', 'known', 'decadent', 'might', 'say', 'perverse', 'pervayer', 'pornography', 'novels', 'were', 'banned', 'English', 'speaking', 'country', '1961', 'fact', 'Miller', 'complexities', 'vesatility', 'human', 'being', 'often', 'overlooked', 'made', 'mainstream', 'success', 'come', 'late', 'life', 'Needless', 'say', 'are', 'scenes', 'graphic', 'sexuality', 'are', 'also', 'portrayed', 'film', 'work', 'yet', 'most', 'books', 'would', 'real', 'life', 'active', 'man', 'exception', 'Tropic', 'Cancer', 'where', 'normal', 'book', 'movie', 'might', 'hold', 'back', 'Miller', 'classic', 'kiss', 'tell', 'Grant', 'Miller', 'was', 'definately', 'ahead', 'time', 'terms', 'sexual', 'theories', 'practice', 'varying', 'forms', 'intimacy', 'bohemian', 'persona', 'existed', 'fairly', 'typical', 'man', 'Lost', 'Generation', 'who', 'hailed', 'middle', 'class', 'German', 'American', 'family', 'Brooklyn.In', 'film', 'directed', 'Philip', 'Kaufman', 'Fred', 'Ward', 'likeable', 'yet', 'gruff', 'Miller', 'character', 'who', 'thought', 'times', 'seemed', 'emphasize', 'street', 'smart', 'New', 'York', 'hustler', 'side', 'Henry', 'rather', 'sentimental', 'spiritualist', 'Miller', 'writing', 'metaphysical', 'philosophical', 'tangents', 'perfectly', 'sex', 'scenes', 'mere', 'brutishness', 'retaining', 'thinking', 'man', 'sense', 'virility', 'obviously', 'not', 'easy', 'aspect', 'get', 'film', 'Ward', 'admirable', 'job', 'general', 'appearance', 'voice', 'match', 'bald', 'gravelly', 'voiced', 'middle', 'aged', 'yet', 'energetic', 'Miller.The', 'screenplay', 'was', 'done', 'Kaufman', 'wife', 'Rose', 'thought', 'added', 'nice', 'touch', 'show', 'gender', 'perspectives', 'how', 'tricky', 'experimental', 'sexuality', 'functioned', 'several', 'levels', 'primarily', 'artisic', 'one', 'dialogue', 'very', 'consistent', 'information', 'pertaining', 'Miller', 'life', ""n't"", 'seemed', 'be', 'altered', 'make', 'more', 'commerical', 'film', 'do', 'would', 'be', 'rather', 'shoddy', 'appreciation', 'classic', 'starving', 'artist', 'who', 'was', 'pertetually', 'short', 'money', 'used', 'New', 'York', 'charm', 'get', 'what', 'needed', 'people', 'giving', 'real', 'life', 'experience', 'character', 'Anais', 'Nin', 'played', 'Maria', 'de', 'Medeiros', 'spot', 'match', 'physically', 'mentally', 'entire', 'production', 'was', 'researched', 'incredibly', 'well', 'obviously', 'made', 'movie', 'equal', 'desires', 'put', 'Miller', 'words', 'screen', 'make', 'profit', 'personal', 'mythology', 'screenplay', 'was', 'based', 'Nin', 'ficticious', 'memoir', 'wild', 'nights', 'Paris', 'essentially', 'story', 'movie', 'French', 'aristocrat', 'open', 'minded', 'yet', 'sweetly', 'naive', 'American', 'husband', 'who', 'understand', 'faciliate', 'sexual', 'needs', 'meeting', 'Henry', 'June', 'Miller', 'Miller', 'roomate', 'Robert', 'Osborn', 'played', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'one', 'earlier', 'roles', 'Nin', 'character', 'somewhat', 'sexual', 'novice', 'who', 'writing', 'book', 'D.H.', 'Lawrence', 'extremely', 'curious', 'sexual', 'exploration', 'discover', 'disturbing', 'pleasurable', 'mainly', 'character', 'June', 'played', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'take', 'June', 'Miller', 'was', 'highlight', 'movie', 'literature', 'somewhat', 'enigmatic', 'Mona', 'Thurman', 'Ward', 'team', 'show', 'artistic', 'bohemian', 'posturing', 'two', 'street', 'hustling', 'hyper', 'sexual', 'New', 'Yorkers', 'also', 'noticed', 'Thurman', 'de', 'Medeiros', 'would', 'go', 'play', 'main', 'female', 'Quentin', 'Tarrantino', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'four', 'years', 'movie', 'screen', 'chemistry', 'quite', 'memorable', 'wildness', 'decadence', 'was', 'rage', 'back', '1920', '30', 'Henry', 'June', 'prototype', 'free', 'love', 'ex-pat', 'community', 'France', 'became', 'one', 'driving', 'forces', 'Western', 'art', '20th', 'century']",N/A

63783,AA0Y6M1TKHNHN,0783230559,Michael Walter,"[7, 8]","The beauty in ""Henry and June"" is full-throttle. There's the bike race through a sunlit forest; there's a colorful bohemian festival with tribal dress and sexual opportunity; there's a series of postcards, accidentally discovered, that picture erotic delights. In the most sublime scene, Nin, in a red dress, dances to sensual, rhythmic music, and her face is given a fantastic close-up. All of the film's beauty, all of its detail and technical mastery, create a luscious idyll.The film balances between dreams and waking life. Its rhythms vary, and are a vital part of its narrative. There are many moments in it when time slows, focusing our attention on a mood or an object, inviting our reverie. The narrative depends as much on music, color, and editing as it does on dialogue. Each scene is thoughtfully made; each part of each scene has been considered.Watching it, we experience an intelligent world full of strong, interesting personae. Nin and Miller, fearless and imaginative, have high goals, and appetites possibly insatiable. Miller is emotional, articulate, and experimental. He appreciates the sensuousness of life. He begs and at least once steals; he struggles to write and to think for himself. Nin is his equal, tenacious and curious, sometimes cruel, trying to understand her desires and trying to bring them to fruition. Watching two dancers with her cousin, she says, ""Oh, look at them, Eduardo. They're so exquisite. If I were a man, I'd be swept away."" At one point, she writes in her diary, ""I feel restless... spirited... adventurous. To be absolutely truthful, I hope secretly to meet someone else. I have erotic imaginings. I want pleasure.""Beauty and strong characters give the film an essential lyricism and lightness. For instance, when June returns, the extended scenes are nightmarish, appropriately raw and claustrophobic. But these scenes conclude in the fog. The fog shifts the mood of the film from the sense of heat and the fire in the claustrophobic rooms to one of regenerative possibilities, a drowsy, dreamy, shadow-heavy world returned. Daylight follows, and the sense of renewal suggested by the fog is made explicit, and further elaborated, by ensuing character development.The beauty is constant and illuminating; the characters seek their satisfactions from life.

63784,A1Q0AQ2HVNSYYW,0783230559,Mr. Cairene,"[81, 98]","Most veiwers who seek out Philip Kuafman's Henry &amp; June will be curious about the sexual content of the film which made the MPAA invent the NC-17 rating, they will be disappointed. The sex in Henry &amp; June is not  groundbreakingly explicit, but there sure is a lot of it. For those viewers  I would reccomend Jean-Jacques Beineix's spectacularly bad (and Oscar  nominated) 1986 film Betty Blue.Henry &amp; June tells the story of  American writer Henry Miller(Fred Ward) and his wife June(Uma Thurman) as  seen through the eyes of Anais Nin(Maria de Medeiros), and here is the  film's biggest problem, it is told from the wrong prespective. Anais is a  spoilt emotianlly immature woman who seeks sexual exprementation for no  reason other then lust in the guise of artful reasoning like &quot;I need  to know people who are alive.&quot; The film would have much more involving  had it been told from Henry's point of view. As played by Fred Ward he is  brutish, easy going, funny and exhilerated by the sexual liberty in 1930s  Paris. He is a man who cries when watching his actress wife in an erotic  film. Unlike Anais he actually has feelings that the audience can identify  with. Perhaps this was unavoidable as the film is adapted from Anais Nin's  diaries.The most interesting character in the film is Henry's bisexual  wife June. Played by Uma Thurman with a deep throaty voice, we see her at  first as an opportunistic woman who uses sex to advance her interests, but  as the film progrsses we learn that a real pain and self loathing is hidden  under her sleak exterior. She is alaways emotionally blackmailing Henry and  Anais, to make her a more noble figure in their books. This is one of Uma  Thurman's best performances, she delivers her lines with a throaty  sexuality, &quot;I've made mistakes, but I've made them superbly&quot; she  says.Due to the overtly erotic nature of the film, it becomes  emotionally aloof. Romance and erotica are polar opposittes. In a love  scene, the less you know about the people involved the more erotic it is,  but less romantic. Most of the naked women in Henry &amp; June are extras,  and the lead character Anais is a mystery anyway. The result is visually  gripping but emtionally uninvolving. Philip Kaufman's 1988 masterpiece The  Unbearable Lightness of Being was also erotic, but that film was much more  effective because he made you care about the characters before they got  naked.The best thing about Henry &amp; June is the details. You could  watch this film with absolutely no dialogue and not lose anything. The  recreation of 1930s Paris is a feast for the eyes, and Philippe Rouselot's  cinamatagrphy is beautiful. I loved how the film re-created parts of that  era, the underground lesbian clubs, the semi-nude parades in the streets,  the old cinemas where the characters watch Luis Bunuel's then scandlous UN  CHEIN ANDALOU and a particularly amusing group of magicians who pick  pockets as a side job.Early on in the film Henry Miller criticises  D.H. Lawrence &quot;He makes too much out of sex, he makes a damn gospel  out of it, my way sex is natural like birth or death&quot;. I don't know if  this criticism is apt for Lawrence but it certainly would be for the  director of this film Philip Kaufman.",3,Erotica VS Romance,957571200,"05 6, 2000",2000,3283,"['Most', 'veiwers', 'who', 'seek', 'out', 'Philip', 'Kuafman', 'Henry', 'amp', 'June', 'will', 'be', 'curious', 'sexual', 'content', 'film', 'made', 'MPAA', 'invent', 'NC-17', 'rating', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'sex', 'Henry', 'amp', 'June', 'not', 'groundbreakingly', 'explicit', 'there', 'sure', 'lot', 'viewers', 'would', 'reccomend', 'Jean-Jacques', 'Beineix', 'spectacularly', 'bad', 'Oscar', 'nominated', '1986', 'film', 'Betty', 'Blue.Henry', 'amp', 'June', 'story', 'American', 'writer', 'Henry', 'Miller', 'Fred', 'Ward', 'wife', 'June', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'seen', 'eyes', 'Anais', 'Nin', 'Maria', 'de', 'Medeiros', 'here', 'film', 'biggest', 'problem', 'told', 'wrong', 'prespective', 'Anais', 'spoilt', 'emotianlly', 'immature', 'woman', 'who', 'sexual', 'exprementation', 'reason', 'other', 'then', 'guise', 'artful', 'reasoning', 'quot', 'need', 'know', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'alive.', 'quot', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'much', 'more', 'involving', 'had', 'been', 'told', 'Henry', 'point', 'view', 'played', 'Fred', 'Ward', 'brutish', 'easy', 'going', 'funny', 'exhilerated', 'sexual', 'liberty', '1930s', 'Paris', 'man', 'who', 'when', 'watching', 'actress', 'wife', 'erotic', 'film', 'Anais', 'actually', 'feelings', 'audience', 'can', 'identify', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'unavoidable', 'film', 'adapted', 'Anais', 'Nin', 'diaries.The', 'most', 'interesting', 'character', 'film', 'Henry', 'bisexual', 'wife', 'June', 'Played', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'deep', 'throaty', 'voice', 'see', 'first', 'opportunistic', 'woman', 'who', 'sex', 'advance', 'interests', 'film', 'learn', 'real', 'pain', 'self', 'loathing', 'hidden', 'sleak', 'exterior', 'alaways', 'emotionally', 'blackmailing', 'Henry', 'Anais', 'make', 'more', 'noble', 'figure', 'books', 'one', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'best', 'performances', 'lines', 'throaty', 'sexuality', 'quot', ""'ve"", 'made', 'mistakes', ""'ve"", 'made', 'superbly', 'quot', 'says.Due', 'overtly', 'erotic', 'nature', 'film', 'emotionally', 'aloof', 'Romance', 'erotica', 'are', 'polar', 'opposittes', 'love', 'scene', 'less', 'know', 'people', 'involved', 'more', 'erotic', 'less', 'romantic', 'Most', 'naked', 'women', 'Henry', 'amp', 'June', 'are', 'extras', 'lead', 'character', 'Anais', 'mystery', 'anyway', 'result', 'visually', 'gripping', 'emtionally', 'uninvolving', 'Philip', 'Kaufman', '1988', 'Unbearable', 'Lightness', 'Being', 'was', 'also', 'erotic', 'film', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'effective', 'made', 'care', 'characters', 'got', 'naked.The', 'best', 'thing', 'Henry', 'amp', 'June', 'details', 'could', 'watch', 'film', 'absolutely', 'dialogue', 'not', 'lose', 'anything', 'recreation', '1930s', 'Paris', 'feast', 'eyes', 'Philippe', 'Rouselot', 'cinamatagrphy', 'beautiful', 'loved', 'how', 'film', 're-created', 'parts', 'era', 'underground', 'lesbian', 'clubs', 'semi-nude', 'parades', 'streets', 'old', 'cinemas', 'where', 'characters', 'watch', 'Luis', 'Bunuel', 'then', 'scandlous', 'UN', 'CHEIN', 'ANDALOU', 'particularly', 'amusing', 'group', 'magicians', 'who', 'pick', 'pockets', 'side', 'job.Early', 'film', 'Henry', 'Miller', 'D.H.', 'Lawrence', 'quot', 'too', 'much', 'sex', 'damn', 'way', 'sex', 'natural', 'birth', 'death', 'quot', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'criticism', 'apt', 'Lawrence', 'certainly', 'would', 'be', 'director', 'film', 'Philip', 'Kaufman']",N/A

I had high expections, due to the reputations of Anais Nin and Henry Miller, but these were not met by this movie.  I love some of Kauffman's films, too.  Maybe he tried too hard here to make it sexy, shocking and erotic and it comes across as really silly, in my opinion.  As another reviewer wrote, for those of us who lived through the 60's this supposedly daring scene seems rather dated.  Like.....sex....what's the big deal?  I don't know the background of Ms. Nin, but apparently exploring and exploiting her sexuality was a big deal....so for those who are interested in that...here it is.I think the film would have been much better if it had been more about Henry and June and less about Nin.  Perhaps the casting was a problem for me, too, as I did not find Maria de Medeiros to be either beautiful or erotic. Nin was not very likable here either and failed to engage my sympathy. She seemed to be a spoiled, immature child-woman, who was living off of her husband's wealth while she indulged in her ""writing"" which was her diary.  Although her husband, Hugo, adored her and enabled her to live this fantastic life in Paris, while folks at home in the US were standing in bread lines, she finds him ""not lively"" enough for her...a banker...how boring.  She is, as another reviewer noted, a dead ringer for Betty Boop, which sort of spoiled the erotic effect for me.  She has a child's mind and a child's body and her dance in which Miller is supposed to see ""her true nature"" was ridiculous. She is supposedly a champion for feminism, but she clings to her comfy lifestyle with Hugo while ""expanding' her erotic repertoire with Henry and June.  Then, like a child, she goes back to Hugo and writes about it all in her diary while she lies in bed with him.  yukI did like Fred Ward, a charming and lusty Miller although he does the same squint-eyed thing in every scene.  (I'd love to see Rip Torn, whom another reviewer said, was great as Miller in Tropic of Cancer.)  The best of the major three was Uma Thurman who truly reeked of eros.  Too bad she left after twenty five minutes of the film.  To have had more of Ward and Thurman might have made for some real heat here.  The little doe-eyed Medeiros, even after Miller unfurls her hair, still projects sly-ness more than sex.  Another actress might have made this a much better film.To be honest, I admit that I didn't see the last half hour of the film.  I sat through more than I could bear, hoping that something significant would happen, but finally gave up.Another excellent reviewer makes the distinction between eroticism and romance.  This is eros, at least one man's attempt at it, and it fails to be interesting or exciting to me, maybe because there is so little development of the characters and hence very little romance.  In real life there must have been more real emotion and romance to their relationships.

Both published a number of books and created quite a stir in the times they lived.  Henry and Anais met in Paris in early thirties. Both were married to other people at that time. Anais' husband Hugo was working as a banker while she was writing her first books.  Henry on the other hand, came to Paris from US pennyless with his wife June who supported his ambition of becoming a writer.  What both Anais and Henry had in common is that June was their muse.  June was strikingly beautiful, uninhibited and somewhat psychologically unstable person.  She had personal charisma and people were drawn to her for her looks and her unconventional life.  June worked to support Henry while he wrote and was disappointed when she realized that his writing style is quite different from Dostoyevsky's.At the time Anais met Henry, she was naive, yet curious about the world around her.  She wanted to be surrounded with people who could entice her to write - she craved to be around ""live"" people.  Luckily for her, Hugo was supportive of her desires.  They seemed to have good marital relations.  But Henry was so different from anyone Anais met before that she allowed herself to have a passionate affair with him that eventually transformed into a life long friendship.  This relationship with Henry (and June) also relinquished her to write with passion she would not have known otherwise.This film is for open minded.  It is explicit, so prudes should not attempt to watch it.  Uma Thurman plays June with someone flawed and half hearted efforts.

63789,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,0783230559,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 3]","Henry and June (Phillip Kaufman, 1990)It seems I start every review of an NC-17 movie with great gusting sighs of frustration about how the NC-17 rating promises so much, and somehow fails to deliver every time. NC-17 should be a code for ""literate porn"", but in reality, it usually has more to do with a filmmaker refusing to cut three buttock thrusts (which David Lynch did to score an R for Wild at Heart) or one almost subliminal and entirely unerotic scene (which Darren Aronofsky refused to cut from Requiem for a Dream, preferring to release the film in all its NC-17 glory). Henry and June fits right in with the rest of them; it's exceptionally literate, but it's hardly porn. For the record, according to IMDB's trivia section, ""The 2 to 3 second shot of Anais looking at an explicit illustrated postcard involving a Japanese woman and a squid was the cause of the NC-17 rating."" Oh, the humanity. (Or the squidianity, I guess. It was nice to discover that tentacle porn did not originate with hentai!)Loosely adapted from the diaries of Anais Nin, Henry and June tells the story (from Nin's POV, obviously) of the love triangle of Nin (the almost painfully beautiful Maria de Medeiros, recently of The Saddest Music in the World), Henry Miller (Fred Ward, whose career has encompassed everything from the sublime [Escape from Alcatraz] to the ridiculous [the Tremors movies]), and Miller's lovely, deeply self-destructive wife June (Uma Thurman, who needs no introduction). There's a lot of casual, if secretive, sex, and a great deal of sighing and hand-wringing, and Henry Miller attempting to write Tropic of Cancer, which Anais and her husband Hugo (Richard E. Grant, recently of Filth and Wisdom) grow to love, while June grows to despise it-- though whether Miller is truly distorting her, or whether she hates seeing so much of her true self on the paper we never find out (and is, in many ways, the movie's most absorbing question).It's not a bad film by any means-- I don't think Kaufman, who has made surprisingly few films over the course of his long and distinguished career, is capable of making a bad film-- but it could certainly have been a better one. The movie's two-hour-plus running time could have been cut by at least half an hour without losing anything of substance (nor of titillation). There's a difference, when one is pacing, between ""leisurely"" and ""pedestrian""; Bela Tarr, for example, makes agonizingly slow movies, but they're great. Henry and June is just plain slow. But within that slowness are stunning performances by just about everyone involved, including small roles from Kevin Spacey, early in his career, Gary Oldman, and Jean-Louis Bunuel (the son of the great director). I watched it in close proximity to Zalman King's painful Delta of Venus, and it's impossible not to compare the two; there's no way Henry and June doesn't come out on top. (Even the pacing is better; Delta of Venus is even more pedestrian.) Still, I can't stop thinking it would've been better if it had been consciously trying to catch the viewer's interest with something other than sex; all these great characters, and we never really get to spend enough quality time with them to really click. ** ",3,"Promises the moon, delivers an eclipse.",1209427200,"04 29, 2008",2008,3227,"['Henry', 'June', 'Phillip', 'Kaufman', '1990', 'start', 'review', 'NC-17', 'movie', 'great', 'gusting', 'sighs', 'frustration', 'how', 'NC-17', 'rating', 'promises', 'so', 'much', 'somehow', 'deliver', 'time', 'NC-17', 'should', 'be', 'code', 'literate', 'porn', 'reality', 'usually', 'more', 'do', 'filmmaker', 'refusing', 'cut', 'three', 'buttock', 'thrusts', 'David', 'Lynch', 'did', 'score', 'R', 'Wild', 'Heart', 'one', 'almost', 'subliminal', 'entirely', 'unerotic', 'scene', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'refused', 'cut', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'preferring', 'release', 'film', 'NC-17', 'glory', 'Henry', 'June', 'fits', 'right', 'rest', 'exceptionally', 'literate', 'hardly', 'porn', 'record', 'according', 'IMDB', 'trivia', 'section', '2', '3', 'second', 'shot', 'Anais', 'looking', 'explicit', 'illustrated', 'postcard', 'involving', 'Japanese', 'woman', 'squid', 'was', 'cause', 'NC-17', 'rating', 'Oh', 'humanity', 'squidianity', 'guess', 'was', 'nice', 'discover', 'tentacle', 'porn', 'did', 'not', 'originate', 'hentai', 'Loosely', 'adapted', 'diaries', 'Anais', 'Nin', 'Henry', 'June', 'story', 'Nin', 'POV', 'obviously', 'love', 'triangle', 'Nin', 'almost', 'painfully', 'beautiful', 'Maria', 'de', 'Medeiros', 'recently', 'Saddest', 'Music', 'World', 'Henry', 'Miller', 'Fred', 'Ward', 'career', 'encompassed', 'everything', 'sublime', '[', 'Escape', 'Alcatraz', ']', 'ridiculous', 'Tremors', 'movies', ']', 'Miller', 'lovely', 'deeply', 'self-destructive', 'wife', 'June', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'who', 'introduction', 'lot', 'casual', 'secretive', 'sex', 'great', 'deal', 'sighing', 'hand-wringing', 'Henry', 'Miller', 'attempting', 'write', 'Tropic', 'Cancer', 'Anais', 'husband', 'Hugo', 'Richard', 'E.', 'Grant', 'recently', 'Filth', 'Wisdom', 'grow', 'love', 'June', 'despise', 'Miller', 'truly', 'distorting', 'seeing', 'so', 'much', 'true', 'self', 'paper', 'never', 'find', 'out', 'many', 'ways', 'movie', 'most', 'absorbing', 'question', '.It', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'means', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Kaufman', 'who', 'made', 'surprisingly', 'few', 'films', 'course', 'long', 'distinguished', 'career', 'capable', 'making', 'bad', 'film', 'could', 'certainly', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'one', 'movie', 'two-hour-plus', 'running', 'time', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'least', 'hour', 'losing', 'anything', 'substance', 'titillation', 'difference', 'when', 'one', 'pacing', 'leisurely', 'pedestrian', 'Bela', 'Tarr', 'example', 'agonizingly', 'slow', 'movies', ""'re"", 'great', 'Henry', 'June', 'just', 'plain', 'slow', 'slowness', 'are', 'stunning', 'performances', 'just', 'everyone', 'involved', 'including', 'small', 'roles', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'early', 'career', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'Jean-Louis', 'Bunuel', 'son', 'great', 'director', 'watched', 'close', 'proximity', 'Zalman', 'King', 'painful', 'Delta', 'Venus', 'impossible', 'not', 'compare', 'two', 'way', 'Henry', 'June', ""n't"", 'come', 'out', 'top', 'Even', 'pacing', 'better', 'Delta', 'Venus', 'even', 'more', 'pedestrian', 'Still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'thinking', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', 'had', 'been', 'consciously', 'trying', 'catch', 'viewer', 'interest', 'something', 'other', 'sex', 'great', 'characters', 'never', 'really', 'get', 'spend', 'enough', 'quality', 'time', 'really', 'click', '**']",N/A
63790,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,0783230559,Robert J. Crawford,"[13, 13]","This is a film, based on lots of written materials from both Anais Nin and Henry Miller, about an extraordinary period in Paris of the 1930s.  I love that city, and the film evokes it in all its unique beauty and ferment, with the fascist revolution of Germany in the background.  For over 30 years, I have studied the Paris of that time, and this film is one of the best on it.The theme of the film is Nin's erotic awakening, when as a meek though ambitious woman - kept by an unusually tolerant banker husband who is the only charicature in the film - she seeks lovers, both men and women.  She is portrayed exceptionally well by de Medeiros, as a kind of proto-feminist and budding writer.  The people she is drawn to are an unconventional couple, Miller and his bi-sexual wife, who are concerned with art and seeking the spark they once felt in eachother with others.  While this is a common dilemma, the fact that they are artists in an amazing time makes their journey unique and stunningly vivid.Things are more or less from the point of view of Nin, whose diaries are the principal source, with a dash of Miller thrown in.  We watch her emerge from private pain and frustration with her dull, though loyal husband, seeking to forge a way for herself to ecstacy and totality.  It is a grand experiment that, I must say, us mortals in conventional relationships will never understand, except perhaps in fantasy.  She has the audacity to really do it, to live it.  (Or so she syas.)Nin is one of the first ""moderns"" whose lives are their work of art, whose actions and choices surpass their artistic output as a way of entering our imaginations.  You can view them in many different ways:  pioneers, simple egoists, or superior beings.  What is great about them is how much they reflect of the history of our times, when so many certainties were breaking down as new (non-christian) ideologies were emerging.  That makes this an exceptional film.Uma Thurman is also brilliant as Miller's troubled wife.  She has this indefinable air about her, a femme fatale who is also pathetic and vulnerable.  While she hangs in the background, in many ways she is the character that controls the actions of the others, laughing at them while also suffering.  This may be her greatest performance.  She rules the climactic moment of the film.While I fall into the camp that views these people as marginal narcissists and mediocre artists, this film is a wonderful snapshot in time.  No matter who you are, you will react to it differently, in your own way and with your own vocabulary.  That makes this a true work of art.  It stimulates and provokes, but cannot be buttonholed.Warmly recommended.",5,art as pornography or vice versa?,1118448000,"06 11, 2005",2005,2689,"['film', 'based', 'lots', 'written', 'materials', 'Anais', 'Nin', 'Henry', 'Miller', 'extraordinary', 'period', 'Paris', '1930s', 'love', 'city', 'film', 'unique', 'beauty', 'ferment', 'fascist', 'revolution', 'Germany', 'background', '30', 'years', 'have', 'studied', 'Paris', 'time', 'film', 'one', 'best', 'it.The', 'theme', 'film', 'Nin', 'erotic', 'awakening', 'when', 'meek', 'ambitious', 'woman', 'kept', 'unusually', 'tolerant', 'banker', 'husband', 'who', 'only', 'charicature', 'film', 'lovers', 'men', 'women', 'portrayed', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'de', 'Medeiros', 'kind', 'proto-feminist', 'budding', 'writer', 'people', 'drawn', 'are', 'unconventional', 'couple', 'Miller', 'bi-sexual', 'wife', 'who', 'are', 'concerned', 'art', 'seeking', 'spark', 'once', 'felt', 'eachother', 'others', 'common', 'dilemma', 'fact', 'are', 'artists', 'amazing', 'time', 'journey', 'unique', 'stunningly', 'vivid.Things', 'are', 'more', 'less', 'point', 'view', 'Nin', 'diaries', 'are', 'principal', 'source', 'dash', 'Miller', 'thrown', 'watch', 'emerge', 'private', 'pain', 'frustration', 'dull', 'loyal', 'husband', 'seeking', 'forge', 'way', 'ecstacy', 'totality', 'grand', 'experiment', 'must', 'say', 'mortals', 'conventional', 'relationships', 'will', 'never', 'understand', 'perhaps', 'fantasy', 'audacity', 'really', 'do', 'live', 'so', 'syas', 'Nin', 'one', 'first', 'moderns', 'lives', 'are', 'work', 'art', 'actions', 'choices', 'surpass', 'artistic', 'output', 'way', 'entering', 'imaginations', 'can', 'view', 'many', 'different', 'ways', 'pioneers', 'simple', 'egoists', 'superior', 'beings', 'What', 'great', 'how', 'much', 'reflect', 'history', 'times', 'when', 'so', 'many', 'certainties', 'were', 'breaking', 'down', 'as', 'new', 'non-christian', 'ideologies', 'were', 'emerging', 'exceptional', 'film.Uma', 'Thurman', 'also', 'brilliant', 'Miller', 'troubled', 'wife', 'indefinable', 'air', 'femme', 'fatale', 'who', 'also', 'pathetic', 'vulnerable', 'background', 'many', 'ways', 'character', 'actions', 'others', 'laughing', 'also', 'suffering', 'may', 'be', 'greatest', 'performance', 'rules', 'climactic', 'moment', 'film.While', 'fall', 'camp', 'people', 'marginal', 'narcissists', 'mediocre', 'artists', 'film', 'wonderful', 'snapshot', 'time', 'No', 'matter', 'who', 'are', 'will', 'react', 'differently', 'own', 'way', 'own', 'vocabulary', 'true', 'work', 'art', 'provokes', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'buttonholed.Warmly', 'recommended']",N/A

There is a lot of sexuality talked and debated about, but the nudity is mostly left to the extras (No Uma, so calm down).  I also have to agree with the spotlight review that says the film is emotionally distant: no matter how much sex they have, their passion really belongs to their writing.I think the film would've been much smuttier if it had been told through Miller's eyes instead of Nin's.  (Rip Torn did an excellent job of portraying Miller's careless leering in a film version of TROPIC OF CANCER, if you can find it on video).The cast was really good.  I'd read that Fred Ward replaced Alec Baldwin, which worked for me: Ward does a great job of capturing Miller's rough earthiness and Brooklyn swagger.  The film also features an early Kevin Spacey as Miller's jealous roommate.If you really liked this film, the locations and the time period, you might also want to check out--believe it or not--THE RAZOR'S EDGE from 1984 with Bill Murray.

Anas Nin is also married, to a man who loves her passionately and romantically. Miller is a man of huge and lusty appetites, and Nin has decided to explore her own capacities for physical affection. This story describes encounters between them, encounters that that turned hotly passionate and seemed to fuel both writers' careers.This isn't always easy on the others around them. Nin manages to keep her husband sweetly oblivious to her affair with Miller. Miller lacks her natural discretion, though. An unstable triangle forms between Henry, June, and Anas. Elegantly filmed sequences show Anas' making love to each (though never together). Perhaps Nin sought out the full range of experience with men and women, or perhaps her involvement with Miller demanded an involvement with his wife, as well. Or maybe, as June said, Nin had a writer's uncontrollable appetite for material.I'm not wholly sure what to make of Nin, as portrayed here. The actress in her role is petite, round-faced, and big-eyed, and makes me think of Nin's contemporary Betty Boop. She's almost childlike in many ways, and more often in the led position than the leading one in her sexual encounters. Uma Thurman's brassy chick from the Bronx (June) is generally good, though the faux Bronx accent didn't always succeed. The sparks struck between Thurman and Nin (Maria de Medeiros) were good, though, both in passion and in anger.It's a generally enjoyable movie, with warm, sometimes torrid physicality.
