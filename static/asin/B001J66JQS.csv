1205318,A2IF6UKZCV0V0Y,B001J66JQS,"C. Clay ""drakkar91""","[1, 1]","I sometimes find it is as fascinating to read other reviews as it is to watch a documentary like this.  Let's start with the fact this was ORIGINALLY RELEASED in 2004 - and made available on DVD in 2009 (according to Amazon).  The film is therefore 10 years old.  That doesn't change the history of Dr. Max Gerson discovering a natural alternative healing approach to treat cancer patients back in the late 1920's.This documentary does exactly what it suggests -1. Introduce the viewer to Max Gerson, learn about his struggle to bring his story forward.2. Learn about the toxins we are subject to in every day life and the food we eat.3. Ultimately learn there may be an alternative form of healing vs. big pharmaceutical medicine as the only means of treatment.How anyone could review that they learned nothing means they were not listening, didn't watch the film, or were close minded to learning about a holistic approach.For every disease and every treatment, one can read stories of people who had 100% success and 100% failure.  I'm sure the same can be said of natural treatments as well.  Whether you believe in mind over body or not is not necessarily relevant to this film (though many would believe the mind is more powerful than we give it credit).I would tend to agree that if the Gerson Therapy was attempted in the United States there would be efforts by large drug companies and government to discredit or stop it. Don't take my word for it, seeFarmageddonand you'll see exactly how the government can intervene in the lives of 'free' citizens.  Like it or not, pharmaceutical companies are in business to make a profit.  Without a never ending need to supply drugs, their revenue dries up.The DVD is an opportunity to learn about Max Gerson, and his treatment - it's not intended to diagnose, treat or cure you. There are books and many other means to gather more information.  Just like any good documentary, this one is opens your eyes to something we typically don't see on the evening news.  While I agree the narrator may not be the most upbeat, that doesn't take away from the content, but you can certainly take a star off your rating if you feel that strongly.  I would have liked a touch more statistical information to show that maybe not everyone that attempted the therapy succeeded?  In general, for me the best documentaries are those that are not afraid to show there are often 2 sides to every story.  Primarily for this reason, I gave it 4 stars vs. 5.  In the end, each individual needs to decide the best action to follow for their own well-being.I will indeed be one of many having viewed this program to seek out more information.  There are many documentary films that will confirm some of the statements in this one - that the food we eat has the potential to heal us or make us very ill.  In 2008,The Beautiful Truth: The World's Simplest Cure for Cancerwas released that some viewers may find more 'lively' and speaks to some of the genetically modified foods.",4,Tremendous Introduction About the Option of Natural Healing,1389398400,"01 11, 2014",2014,3002,"['sometimes', 'find', 'fascinating', 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'watch', 'documentary', 'Let', 'start', 'fact', 'was', 'ORIGINALLY', 'RELEASED', '2004', 'made', 'available', 'DVD', '2009', 'according', 'Amazon', 'film', 'therefore', '10', 'years', 'old', ""n't"", 'change', 'history', 'Dr.', 'Max', 'Gerson', 'discovering', 'natural', 'alternative', 'healing', 'approach', 'treat', 'cancer', 'patients', 'back', 'late', ""1920's.This"", 'documentary', 'exactly', 'what', '-1', 'Introduce', 'viewer', 'Max', 'Gerson', 'learn', 'struggle', 'bring', 'story', 'forward.2', 'Learn', 'toxins', 'are', 'subject', 'day', 'life', 'food', 'eat.3', 'Ultimately', 'may', 'be', 'alternative', 'form', 'healing', 'vs.', 'big', 'pharmaceutical', 'medicine', 'only', 'treatment.How', 'anyone', 'could', 'review', 'learned', 'nothing', 'means', 'were', 'not', 'listening', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'film', 'were', 'close', 'minded', 'learning', 'holistic', 'approach.For', 'disease', 'treatment', 'one', 'can', 'read', 'stories', 'people', 'who', 'had', '100', '%', 'success', '100', '%', 'failure', ""'m"", 'sure', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'natural', 'treatments', 'well', 'Whether', 'believe', 'mind', 'body', 'not', 'not', 'necessarily', 'relevant', 'film', 'many', 'would', 'believe', 'mind', 'more', 'powerful', 'give', 'credit', 'would', 'tend', 'agree', 'Gerson', 'Therapy', 'was', 'attempted', 'United', 'States', 'would', 'be', 'efforts', 'large', 'drug', 'companies', 'government', 'discredit', 'stop', 'Do', ""n't"", 'take', 'word', ""'ll"", 'see', 'exactly', 'how', 'government', 'can', 'intervene', 'lives', ""'free"", 'citizens', 'not', 'pharmaceutical', 'companies', 'are', 'business', 'make', 'profit', 'never', 'ending', 'need', 'supply', 'drugs', 'revenue', 'up.The', 'DVD', 'opportunity', 'learn', 'Max', 'Gerson', 'treatment', 'not', 'intended', 'diagnose', 'treat', 'cure', 'are', 'books', 'many', 'other', 'means', 'gather', 'more', 'information', 'Just', 'good', 'documentary', 'one', 'eyes', 'something', 'typically', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'evening', 'news', 'agree', 'narrator', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'most', 'upbeat', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'content', 'can', 'certainly', 'take', 'star', 'rating', 'feel', 'strongly', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'touch', 'more', 'statistical', 'information', 'show', 'maybe', 'not', 'everyone', 'attempted', 'therapy', 'succeeded', 'general', 'best', 'documentaries', 'are', 'are', 'not', 'afraid', 'show', 'are', 'often', '2', 'sides', 'story', 'Primarily', 'reason', 'gave', '4', 'stars', 'vs.', '5', 'end', 'individual', 'decide', 'best', 'action', 'follow', 'own', 'well-being.I', 'will', 'indeed', 'be', 'one', 'many', 'having', 'viewed', 'program', 'seek', 'out', 'more', 'information', 'are', 'many', 'documentary', 'films', 'will', 'confirm', 'statements', 'one', 'food', 'eat', 'potential', 'heal', 'make', 'very', 'ill', '2008', 'Beautiful', 'Truth', 'World', 'Simplest', 'Cure', 'Cancerwas', 'released', 'viewers', 'may', 'find', 'more', ""'lively"", 'speaks', 'genetically', 'modified', 'foods']",N/A

1205330,A22FFXBR4U3S8X,B001J66JQS,Michael B. Green,"[1, 1]","The chief difficulty of this documentary on the lifework of Charlotte Gerson - applying the cancer cure her physician father Max reportedly discovered in 1938 - is not the shaky camera work, but the sad failure to present substantive evidence to support the Gerson diet despite the fact that she opened the Gerson Institute in 1977.  The Gerson position is simple: cancer and almost all other illnesses are caused by deficient nutrition and bodily toxicity; a strict idiosyncratic organic vegan diet combined with coffee enemas reactivates the bodily immune system which is sufficient to kill any cancers and cure any chronic diseases.If she has a cure, and I am not saying that she doesn't, Ms. Gerson has utterly failed to make any convincing show of it.  After decades of allegedly curing any and all kinds of cancer in presumably thousands of cases, the best Ms. Gerson could do was to present testimonials from half-a-dozen or so medically nave and uninformed people whose sincerity I do not doubt, claiming that she cured their cancer.  One young Hispanic mother believed she had breast cancer and believes she no longer does.  Gerson never bothers to say that the remission was confirmed by x-ray or biopsy, and we have no way to know that it was confirmed other than patient attitude or optimism.  There is no consideration of the relatively high rate of spontaneous remission for early-stage breast cancer.  A crotchety senior refused to let the doctors remove his ""prostrate [sic]"" following what he claims was a malignant biopsy and now reports a PSA of 0.06.  A self-reported victim of pancreatic cancers tells us that her (conventional) doctors were amazed at her recovery - and that she and her acquaintance actor Michael Landon were sure he would have lived had he stuck to the Gerson diet.There is never any showing of an x-ray before and then after treatment that shows the tumors remitted or disappeared; in fact there is not a single piece of objective medical evidence in support of her claims.  One wonders whether the woman witness who believed she had pancreatic cancer perhaps had a benign pancreatic endocrine tumor that resolved itself.  At one point Ms. Gerson claims that unlike conventional medicine that might arrest osteoporosis, her carrot juice remedy reverses the condition.  She offers not a shred of proof, and does not state the evidentiary basis for her claim.  There is not, for example, the claim that she put 10 people with measured bone density of average x on the diet, and after 6 months their average bone density was x+y with an average percentile improvement of thus-and-such.  She is not interested in evidence; she is an oracle, she has spoken, we must take her word for what she says.  (And yes, of course I agree with her that drinking milk decalcifies bone by leaching out calcium to reduce bodily acidity that milk protein produces.)Ms. Gerson emphasizes that not any juicer will do: it must be a Norwalk juicer, an ancient model of which is shown as though in a reliquary, which extracts juice in two separate actions.  We feel confident that she has never run any clinical comparisons with, say, a Jack LaLanne juicer, but that her attachment to the Norwalk devolves from her father's intuitions about how the carrot cells are supposedly shredded by the Norwalk.  To prove that this is right, Ms. Gerson offers a picture of its inventor -- an old lean healthy looking Mr. Norman Walker who claimed that juicing should permit one to live to 120 and then tells us ""he lived to 117,""  which is false per Wikipedia:[BEGIN QUOTE] As of 2006, most book reviews and promotional web sites wrongly claim that Walker reached the phenomenal age of, variously, 109, 113, 116, 118 or even 119 years. Several official sources[1][2][3] the U.S. Social Security Death Index[4] and a grave marker[5] all indicate that he actually lived to be 99 years of age.[6] [END QUOTE]When I read her father's book years ago ""A Cancer Therapy: Results of 50 Cases"" I was sympathetic and yet unconvinced.  I felt that Dr. Gerson might well be on the right path to curing a good number of cancers, but that his exposition and evidence were both wanting.  I hoped that a review of his evidence by medical professionals would extract the evidence (and then refine his treatments to their effective elements), but all the official reviews dismiss it and although I am sophisticated and generally against the medical establishment, I find myself agreeing with the general tone of criticism against the Gerson diet (even though some critiques are unfairly biased against him).  See the assessments linked to the Wikipedia entry for ""Max Gerson.""  The medical establishment's bias shows in demanding that Ms. Gerson follow protocols using large-scale well-funded placebo-treatment control groups and compare long-term survival rates, which is unnecessary.  But if Ms. Gerson wants to use a ""case study"" methodology, then she must start with a half-dozen cases of objectively well-documented conventionally incurable cancers that do not spontaneously remit, and then prove to us that she has cured them.  Unfortunately, she does not even attempt to do so.Ms. Gerson unequivocally implies that her father was poisoned twice, and killed by the second poisoning, to prevent his book from being published.  I share her view that this is a likely response from the medical establishment to any holistic cancer cure that is outside the for-profit allopathic medical model (though hers is not cheap - hospitalization at the clinics she licenses in Tijuana costs circa $5,500 weekly payable in advance).  But if Dr. Gerson was murdered because he had a partial cure, then she owes him a better statement of and justification for her treatment modality than given in this documentary.  It is somewhat sad to see her telling two Czech physicians about her method, and then proudly displaying a brochure of a Budapest castle that has been converted into a hospital for treating cancer patients with the Gerson Therapy.  Page after page of the brochure shows one exquisitely appointed room after another - obviously a ploy to play on the fears of the wealthy afflicted with cancer while separating them from a significant portion of their wealth rather than a patient-oriented treatment with a hope of saving large numbers of people from cancer.  Whereas she wants to help save the health of the world, Ms. Gerson's lack of medical or scientific training make her a poor exponent of her own method, and impair her judgment so that she cannot see for what it is a Czech cancer version of an upscale rip-off ""fat farm"" for Czech elites.  Instead, she believes that she is spreading the Word.",2,"Strong on Oracular Pronouncements, Weak on Evidence",1400889600,"05 24, 2014",2014,6694,"['chief', 'difficulty', 'documentary', 'lifework',

1205332,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B001J66JQS,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[2, 2]","After readingThe Gerson Therapy: The Proven Nutritional Program for Cancer and Other IllnessesI will say that this DVD is simply an overview and introduction - not a step-by-step video. If you are looking for recipes or the exact program details you'd be better off reading the book. And even then this is a difficult program to follow without a doctor's help.I will say that in this documentary Charlotte Gerson looks like the picture of health. She radiates beauty and seems very healthy and happy. There are also numerous people in this DVD that have recovered from cancer, including a young child who looked very happy to be riding her horse and living life to the fullest. I wish they had shown a picture of her when she was a skeleton and very sick. It would have provided a nice contrast and would have been even more convincing.I can't say if this therapy is the best for you or not. But the stories of people who were cured of illness are very interesting. This DVD also explains how we are living on a toxic planet. The explanation of the dangers you experience each day is eye opening. This program definitely promotes a vegetarian lifestyle with plenty of organic produce.What I did find interesting was the process of obtaining juice with a Norwalk juicer. I'd never seen one before.So again, if you are looking for specifics and more details get the book. If you want to expand your knowledge of The Gerson Therapy then this is intriguing.This review is for information purposes only. I take no responsibility for your health if you take the advice in this DVD.
