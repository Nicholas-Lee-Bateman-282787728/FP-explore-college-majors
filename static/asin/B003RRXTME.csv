1361231,AAED7MGKR5S80,B003RRXTME,Amber S.,"[2, 2]","It seems that a lot of people compare this show to our version of ""The L Word.""  In truth I've never seen ""The L Word""  before.  However, I saw the reviews it was getting on here and what it had gotten on Netflix, and I figured ""sure.  I'll give it a shot!""  After adjusting the slightly different way tv shows are written and directed to ours (a minor difference, but significant enough to me a movie buff) and having let the characters develop I COULD NOT TEAR my eyes away from this tv show!!  It was just AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  My favorite character in this show is hands down is Frankie.  She's so awesome and brings so much to this show!!!!! In truth, it was her character that made me wanna continue to watch this and I did.  She's smart, funny, a closet romantic, and just a wild woman expressing herself in one way that she knows very well.  Needless to say, she's just awesome!!  May not deal with things in the same way I do, but we're all human and we all make mistakes.  And the character Frankie has had that reputation in her past, as it haunts parts of her future.I cannot tell you how many people I've recommended to see this show, but I really hope that they continue to have a season three and that they bring Frankie back in it!!  She gives the show a liveliness, that although I like the other characters such as Tess and Ed, and Lexy, it just wasn't the same without Frankie.  It was still good, don't get me wrong.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND you see this if you've not already.  I'm shocked that there aren't more reviews for this show.  Word clearly hasn't spread out far enough yet to get peoples attention.  I'm hoping that at some point this will change and that they see what it is we're talking about.  You don't know until you watch, and I for one am glad that I did!!",5,A GREAT show!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1341446400,"07 5, 2012",2012,1804,"['lot', 'people', 'compare', 'show', 'version', 'L', 'Word', 'truth', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'L', 'Word', 'However', 'saw', 'reviews', 'was', 'getting', 'here', 'what', 'had', 'gotten', 'Netflix', 'figured', 'sure', ""'ll"", 'give', 'shot', 'adjusting', 'slightly', 'different', 'way', 'tv', 'shows', 'are', 'written', 'directed', 'ours', 'minor', 'difference', 'significant', 'enough', 'movie', 'buff', 'having', 'let', 'characters', 'develop', 'COULD', 'NOT', 'TEAR', 'eyes', 'away', 'tv', 'show', 'was', 'just', 'AMAZING', 'favorite', 'character', 'show', 'hands', 'down', 'Frankie', 'so', 'awesome', 'so', 'much', 'show', 'truth', 'was', 'character', 'made', 'wan', 'continue', 'watch', 'did', 'smart', 'funny', 'closet', 'romantic', 'just', 'wild', 'woman', 'expressing', 'one', 'way', 'very', 'well', 'Needless', 'say', 'just', 'awesome', 'May', 'not', 'deal', 'things', 'same', 'way', 'do', ""'re"", 'human', 'make', 'mistakes', 'character', 'Frankie', 'had', 'reputation', 'past', 'parts', 'future.I', 'can', 'not', 'tell', 'how', 'many', 'people', ""'ve"", 'recommended', 'see', 'show', 'really', 'hope', 'continue', 'have', 'season', 'three', 'bring', 'Frankie', 'back', 'show', 'liveliness', 'like', 'other', 'characters', 'such', 'Tess', 'Ed', 'Lexy', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'same', 'Frankie', 'was', 'still', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'HIGHLY', 'RECOMMEND', 'see', ""'ve"", 'not', 'already', ""'m"", 'shocked', 'are', ""n't"", 'more', 'reviews', 'show', 'Word', 'clearly', ""n't"", 'spread', 'out', 'far', 'enough', 'yet', 'get', 'peoples', 'attention', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'point', 'will', 'change', 'see', 'what', ""'re"", 'talking', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'watch', 'one', 'am', 'glad', 'did']",Lip Service Series 1

1361235,A3B26C1WRMBEAC,B003RRXTME,Zoe Marr,"[0, 1]","""Lip Service"" was fantastic. I checked it out on a whim and now that I've seen it, I am shocked more people don't talk about this show. It certainly achieves far more than ""The L Word"" could. Great actresses, fascinating characters, provocative scenes (that boldly go where The L Word somehow failed to tread), and really witty engaging dialogue. This show was great, I highly recommend Season 1. NOTE: Stay far far away from Season 2, it's awful, the total antithesis of everything that worked the first time around. Stick with the first season and enjoy it - fantastic television!",5,A great show...,1341273600,"07 3, 2012",2012,582,"['Lip', 'Service', 'was', 'fantastic', 'checked', 'out', 'whim', 'now', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'am', 'shocked', 'more', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'talk', 'show', 'certainly', 'far', 'more', 'L', 'Word', 'could', 'Great', 'fascinating', 'characters', 'provocative', 'scenes', 'boldly', 'go', 'where', 'L', 'Word', 'somehow', 'failed', 'tread', 'really', 'witty', 'engaging', 'dialogue', 'show', 'was', 'great', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Season', '1', 'NOTE', 'Stay', 'far', 'far', 'away', 'Season', '2', 'awful', 'total', 'antithesis', 'everything', 'worked', 'first', 'time', 'around', 'Stick', 'first', 'season', 'enjoy', 'fantastic', 'television']",Lip Service Series 1
