184130,A2F5PAC9I5SCG6,1565672712,Ernest Jagger,"[6, 6]","""Samurai Banners,"" is an epic samurai drama film clocking in at almost 3 hours long. The film, directed by Hiroshi Inagaki, is set in Japan between 1543 to 1562. It is a time of constant strife. Some of the viewers noted that their DVD does not have subtitles. There must have been a problem with their versions, as the one I own has perfect subtitles, which are in different colors to allow the viewer to see who is talking. And although the film is long, it is definitely well worth the purchase. The legendary Toshiro Mifune gives a fine performance as Kansuke Yamamoto: One of Japan's great Generals during the wars of medieval Japan.Kansuke Yamamoto (Toshiro Mifune) was a military strategist for the Takeda clan. And although the film is based on the life of Takeda Shinken, whose reputation is even greater today in Japan, than that of either Tokugawa or Toyotomi, the film gives a great look at his greatest warrior General: General Kansuke Yamamoto. The films climax is very good, where the battle of Kawanakajima [a historic battle in Japanese history] nearly cost the Takeda clan its power, due to a disastrous mistake by Kansuke Yamamoto. The costumes in the film are great, and compliment the great look of medieval Japan.The film will give you the viewer a very good look at what the cause of the wars during medieval Japan were like, and why they were fought. Among the DVD specials inside the disc, include a biography of the films characters and another dealing with the wars of medieval Japan. And why they fought. It is advisable to view this prior to viewing the film, as it will give you the viewer a better understanding of the nature of these wars: an overview which will really help you understand the historic events of these times. Many viewers compare this film to Kurosawa's classics, and this is not fair. The film stands on its own merits. This is a very good film in its own right. I have all of Kurosawa's films, but there are other good films out there too. I recommend it for your DVD collection, it is a worthwhile film to own.",4,A Very Good Epic Samurai Film!,1167609600,"01 1, 2007",2007,2062,"['Samurai', 'Banners', 'epic', 'samurai', 'drama', 'film', 'clocking', 'almost', '3', 'hours', 'long', 'film', 'directed', 'Hiroshi', 'Inagaki', 'set', 'Japan', '1543', '1562', 'time', 'constant', 'strife', 'viewers', 'noted', 'DVD', 'not', 'have', 'subtitles', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'problem', 'versions', 'one', 'own', 'perfect', 'subtitles', 'are', 'different', 'colors', 'allow', 'viewer', 'see', 'who', 'talking', 'film', 'long', 'definitely', 'well', 'purchase', 'legendary', 'Toshiro', 'Mifune', 'fine', 'performance', 'Kansuke', 'Yamamoto', 'One', 'Japan', 'great', 'Generals', 'wars', 'medieval', 'Japan.Kansuke', 'Yamamoto', 'Toshiro', 'Mifune', 'was', 'military', 'strategist', 'Takeda', 'clan', 'film', 'based', 'life', 'Takeda', 'Shinken', 'reputation', 'even', 'greater', 'today', 'Japan', 'Tokugawa', 'Toyotomi', 'film', 'great', 'look', 'greatest', 'warrior', 'General', 'General', 'Kansuke', 'Yamamoto', 'films', 'climax', 'very', 'good', 'where', 'battle', 'Kawanakajima', '[', 'historic', 'battle', 'Japanese', 'history', ']', 'nearly', 'cost', 'Takeda', 'clan', 'power', 'due', 'disastrous', 'mistake', 'Kansuke', 'Yamamoto', 'costumes', 'film', 'are', 'great', 'compliment', 'great', 'look', 'medieval', 'Japan.The', 'film', 'will', 'give', 'viewer', 'very', 'good', 'look', 'what', 'cause', 'wars', 'medieval', 'Japan', 'were', 'like', 'why', 'were', 'fought', 'DVD', 'specials', 'disc', 'include', 'biography', 'films', 'characters', 'dealing', 'wars', 'medieval', 'Japan', 'why', 'fought', 'advisable', 'view', 'prior', 'viewing', 'film', 'will', 'give', 'viewer', 'better', 'understanding', 'nature', 'wars', 'overview', 'will', 'really', 'help', 'understand', 'historic', 'events', 'times', 'Many', 'viewers', 'compare', 'film', 'Kurosawa', 'classics', 'not', 'fair', 'film', 'own', 'merits', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'own', 'right', 'have', 'Kurosawa', 'films', 'are', 'other', 'good', 'films', 'there', 'too', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'collection', 'worthwhile', 'film', 'own']",N/A

However, upon closer examination, he is also a man of sensuality, which shows in his love for Nature, as well as love for a woman, a princess.Kansuke is, as I mentioned a strategist, a very talented one. However, from the perspective of his immediate society - he is strange - very hard to understand (even for the other generals), almost always by himself, always blamed for speaking out too loudly or inappropriately. Coincidentely, the only person who seems to be insync with this guy, is his own master - Takeda Shingen.That in fact becomes a key of Kansuke's relationship to his other blood goal besides the military domination - his love for the Princess Yu. Although greatly desiring this girl, Kansuke must yield to the greater force represented by Takeda, which in fact just inflames him and makes the Princess a sort of Goddess in human form.On an equal foot, Kansuke's own death in battle symbolizes his unity with his loved ones - a woman and a complete release from suffering.This turn of events reveal yet another side of Kasnuke (played by admirable Toshiro Mifune) - his utter vulnarbility, and even innocence prior to his demise.

The AnimEigo edition of Samurai Banners proves to be well presented and its subtitles with its different colors to see who's talking proves to be one of the highlights. This movie got excellent subtitles!! Maybe that reviewer who didn't get the subtitles should check his DVD player. He may have turned something off.I enjoyed watching Samurai Banners despite of its 163 minutes or so length and the fact that its more of a samurai drama film with a war theme then anything else. Toshiro Mifune who have been considered as Japan's verison of John Wayne is well cast in this movie as it followed the destiny of the Takeda clan through many campaigns. For those who may care, Takeda clan also featured in the film, Kagamusha. Mifune's character, Yamamoto Kansuke (real historical figure), joined the clan, and it helped lead it to many victories, gaining the trust and confidence of his lord and along the way, fall in love with his lord's concubine. The movie is well acted, scripted and directed although fans of bloody battles may have to look else where.Although the movie seem to dragged here and there but overall, despite of the length, the film moves with great deal of interest. The audience will be caught up in the going on of the Takeda clan and its struggles as they faced stronger foes as the movie goes on. For any Mifune fan, this movie should be on the mandatory buy list. Although Mifune's fortune fell after he left his partnership with Kurosawa, this movie still showed him at his best.There are couple of interesting extras in this package. There is a one about character biographies which should be watch before the movie since it introduced the viewer to all the major characters of the movie. It probably be easier to followed the film. Second for more die-hard fan, there is Interactive Program Notes which gives you a super basic history lesson on period of warring warlords in Japan. It might be interesting to read this before watching the film. It may help understand the motivation behind some of the characters. Both features are pretty short in duration.Overall a pretty good film, not boring and although bit pricy, a definitely worth the money.(History minded viewer should read the book Kawanakajima 1553-64 by Stephen Turnbull for more in-depth historical look at the background of this movie.

184135,AL5BWQ7N6MLQK,1565672712,"Ronin Dave ""Far be it for Logic to Stand in t...","[1, 1]","Samurai Banners is one of those sweeping epics of a bygone era of Japanese cinema. It's grandiose in scale, costume, and character. Samurai Banners or rather Furin Kazan is based on the novel by Inoue Yusushi detailing the rise to power of a poor samurai known as Yamamoto Kansuke. Kansuke is one those beloved characters in Japan because he rose from nearly nothing to success. It is only fitting that he be played by one Japanese cinema's greatest actors, Mifune Toshiro.Mifune's Kansuke can be ruthless and scheming as shown by how he gets his introduction to the Takeda clan and how he deals with Lord Suwa but he is also principled and sees the potential of Takeda Shingen even when Shingen cannot see it himself. He is not cruel for cruelty's sake but for grim necessity. What softens his demeanor somewhat is the presence of Lord Suwa's daughter, the Lady Yu.The character of Lady Yu really helps round out the film as her presence even when not on screen casts its influence on the events and motives of Kansuke and Shingen. She lost her father and her clan to Kansuke's schemes and she has good reason to hate both him and his lord Takeda.Although Kansuke loves her, his station does not permit him to pursue such love especially when his lord decides to make her one of his concubines. Thus is formed the love triangle amongst these characters but one can easily sense that Kansuke truly loves Lady Yu for her character and not just her beauty. He resolves his conflict between love and duty into fierce loyalty towards Lady Yu and when she gives birth, her son is whom Kansuke wants to see become a great leader.Ironically the great Takeda Shingen of historical renown comes off as a two-dimensional secondary character next to these two. He is relatively happy and well off while the other two must continually deal with their conflicting emotions and underlying pain.Meanwhile history precedes relentlessly as while these three deal with their feelings, the Takeda clan grows and expands through battle and political strategy. The film ends with the great climatic battle of Kawanakajima in 1561. Here we see the classic confrontation of Shingen and Uesugi Kenshin as the former wards off the sword strokes of the latter with his war fan. And we see the ultimate fate of Yamamoto Kansuke.Overall, Samurai Banners is great film both for students of history and also for movie-goers who like a good story. The historical backdrop and battles don't drown the characters as can happen in these types of films. The cinematography in some of the scenes is simply beautiful. Now if you are looking for an action-packed slice-em and dice-em type samurai action flick short on plot and character then Samurai Banners is not for you.",5,Samurai War Epic Driven By Story and Character,1264723200,"01 29, 2010",2010,2736,"['Samurai', 'Banners', 'one', 'sweeping', 'epics', 'bygone', 'era', 'Japanese', 'cinema', 'grandiose', 'scale', 'costume', 'character', 'Samurai', 'Banners', 'rather', 'Furin', 'Kazan', 'based', 'novel', 'Inoue', 'Yusushi', 'detailing', 'rise', 'power', 'poor', 'samurai', 'known', 'Yamamoto', 'Kansuke', 'Kansuke', 'one', 'beloved', 'characters', 'Japan', 'rose', 'nearly', 'nothing', 'success', 'only', 'fitting', 'be', 'played', 'one', 'Japanese', 'cinema', 'greatest', 'actors', 'Mifune', 'Toshiro.Mifune', 'Kansuke', 'can', 'be', 'ruthless', 'scheming', 'shown', 'how', 'introduction', 'Takeda', 'clan', 'how', 'Lord', 'Suwa', 'also', 'principled', 'potential', 'Takeda', 'Shingen', 'even', 'when', 'Shingen', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'not', 'cruel', 'cruelty', 'sake', 'grim', 'necessity', 'What', 'demeanor', 'somewhat', 'presence', 'Lord', 'Suwa', 'daughter', 'Lady', 'Yu.The', 'character', 'Lady', 'Yu', 'really', 'round', 'film', 'presence', 'even', 'when', 'not', 'screen', 'casts', 'influence', 'events', 'motives', 'Kansuke', 'Shingen', 'lost', 'father', 'clan', 'Kansuke', 'schemes', 'good', 'reason', 'hate', 'lord', 'Takeda.Although', 'Kansuke', 'station', 'not', 'permit', 'pursue', 'such', 'love', 'especially', 'when', 'lord', 'make', 'one', 'concubines', 'Thus', 'formed', 'love', 'triangle', 'characters', 'one', 'can', 'easily', 'sense', 'Kansuke', 'truly', 'Lady', 'Yu', 'character', 'not', 'just', 'beauty', 'conflict', 'love', 'duty', 'fierce', 'loyalty', 'towards', 'Lady', 'Yu', 'when', 'birth', 'son', 'whom', 'Kansuke', 'see', 'become', 'great', 'leader.Ironically', 'great', 'Takeda', 'Shingen', 'historical', 'renown', 'off', 'two-dimensional', 'secondary', 'character', 'two', 'relatively', 'happy', 'well', 'other', 'two', 'must', 'continually', 'deal', 'conflicting', 'emotions', 'underlying', 'pain.Meanwhile', 'history', 'precedes', 'relentlessly', 'three', 'deal', 'feelings', 'Takeda', 'clan', 'grows', 'through', 'battle', 'political', 'strategy', 'film', 'great', 'climatic', 'battle', 'Kawanakajima', '1561', 'Here', 'see', 'classic', 'confrontation', 'Shingen', 'Uesugi', 'Kenshin', 'former', 'wards', 'sword', 'strokes', 'latter', 'war', 'fan', 'see', 'ultimate', 'fate', 'Yamamoto', 'Kansuke.Overall', 'Samurai', 'Banners', 'great', 'film', 'students', 'history', 'also', 'movie-goers', 'who', 'good', 'story', 'historical', 'backdrop', 'battles', 'do', ""n't"", 'drown', 'characters', 'can', 'happen', 'types', 'films', 'cinematography', 'scenes', 'simply', 'beautiful', 'Now', 'are', 'looking', 'action-packed', 'slice-em', 'dice-em', 'type', 'samurai', 'action', 'flick', 'short', 'plot', 'character', 'then', 'Samurai', 'Banners', 'not']",N/A

If you pay close attention, you will be able to follow the plot, at least in the first half.  I did really well, until Mifune and the lord (who both love the same woman) become monks complete with vows of chastity.  Either this significant event was not explained adequately or my mind wandered at a crucil time.  But, no matter.  I liked the movie enough that I just accepted them as monks and went on with the story.  Although I am not a student of Japanese history, I have learned some of the basics just by watching the films of Kurosawa, Mizoguchi, Ozu and particularly those films starring Toshiro Mifune, my favorite actor.  In this film, the color is brilliant, the music is outstanding, the costumes are magnificent and the acting, I think, is superb.  However, since the film occurs over an approximate 20 year span, there are a lot of battles and much intrigue that happens during that time frame, and it can get confusing at times.  Mifune's character is somewhat on the scheming underhanded side, but what does one expect in time of war?  I do not see him as ruthless or cruel, just simply focused on his goal -- perhaps so much so that it eventually betrays him.The AniMe version I own is great.  The subtitles appear in different colors so that one can distinguish which character is speaking.  Also, there are character summaries which I really recommend that you read before viewing the film.  It will help immensely in understanding the plot, the time period, the political climate, etc.  There is also a very interesting history about the time period that can be viewed, but I wasn't able to pause it as it was being presented.  I found this disappointing since I like to think about and digest what I am reading as I go along, especially if one important event after another is being presentted.  Even so, I am most happy with the DVD version I have.Viewed strictly as an adventure epic and not even considering the fact that this film is based on actual events (I believe), the movie is highly entertaining.  It is long, but the time flies by.  The photography is really grand in scope, seeming to use hundreds or thousands of extras, long panoramic shots and beautiful horsemanship by the troops opposing each other.If you are a Toshiro Mifune fan, you will undoubtedly enjoy seeing him in all his swaggering bravado -- although he does have a limp (which I'm not sure was explained or not).  I have only watched the film once and find that repeated viewings of (almost) any film really enhance your enjoyment of it, since there is no way one can absorb everything the first time around.",4,Stirring Epic Adventure!,1184284800,"07 13, 2007",2007,2687,"['First', 'let', 'say', 'long', 'movie', 'complete', 'actual', 'intermission', 'pay', 'close', 'attention', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'follow', 'plot', 'least', 'first', 'half', 'did', 'really', 'well', 'Mifune', 'lord', 'who', 'love', 'same', 'woman', 'become', 'monks', 'complete', 'vows', 'chastity', 'significant', 'event', 'was', 'not', 'explained', 'adequately', 'mind', 'wandered', 'crucil', 'time', 'matter', 'liked', 'movie', 'just', 'accepted', 'monks', 'went', 'story', 'am', 'not', 'student', 'Japanese', 'history', 'have', 'learned', 'basics', 'just', 'watching', 'films', 'Kurosawa', 'Mizoguchi', 'Ozu', 'particularly', 'films', 'starring', 'Toshiro', 'Mifune', 'favorite', 'actor', 'film', 'color', 'brilliant', 'music', 'outstanding', 'costumes', 'are', 'magnificent', 'acting', 'think', 'superb', 'However', 'film', 'approximate', '20', 'year', 'span', 'are', 'lot', 'battles', 'much', 'intrigue', 'time', 'frame', 'can', 'get', 'confusing', 'times', 'Mifune', 'character', 'somewhat', 'scheming', 'underhanded', 'side', 'what', 'one', 'expect', 'time', 'war', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'ruthless', 'cruel', 'just', 'simply', 'focused', 'goal', 'perhaps', 'so', 'much', 'eventually', 'him.The', 'AniMe', 'version', 'own', 'great', 'subtitles', 'appear', 'different', 'colors', 'one', 'can', 'distinguish', 'character', 'speaking', 'Also', 'are', 'character', 'summaries', 'really', 'recommend', 'read', 'viewing', 'film', 'will', 'help', 'immensely', 'understanding', 'plot', 'time', 'period', 'political', 'climate', 'etc', 'also', 'very', 'interesting', 'history', 'time', 'period', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'was', ""n't"", 'able', 'pause', 'was', 'being', 'presented', 'found', 'disappointing', 'like', 'think', 'digest', 'what', 'am', 'reading', 'go', 'along', 'especially', 'one', 'important', 'event', 'being', 'presentted', 'Even', 'so', 'am', 'most', 'happy', 'DVD', 'version', 'have.Viewed', 'strictly', 'adventure', 'epic', 'not', 'even', 'considering', 'fact', 'film', 'based', 'actual', 'events', 'believe', 'movie', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'long', 'time', 'flies', 'photography', 'really', 'grand', 'scope', 'seeming', 'use', 'hundreds', 'thousands', 'extras', 'long', 'panoramic', 'shots', 'beautiful', 'horsemanship', 'troops', 'opposing', 'other.If', 'are', 'Toshiro', 'Mifune', 'fan', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'swaggering', 'bravado', 'have', 'limp', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'explained', 'not', 'have', 'only', 'watched', 'film', 'once', 'find', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'almost', 'film', 'really', 'enhance', 'enjoyment', 'way', 'one', 'can', 'absorb', 'everything', 'first', 'time', 'around']",N/A

I think the true theme of the film is the relationship between the three main characters, so the film is forced to cover the entire time period, rather than just a couple of his military campaigns. However, covering the campaigns it does, drawing into it, Kansuke's influence and his feelings for Princess Yu.No criticism of the acting. I think Toshiro Mifune's peformance in this film is one of his best, and shows a well-roundedness of the character he plays.  Kinnosuke Nakamura is one of my favorite actors, so of course, I will say he gives a good performance as well. Hiroshi Inagaki does a good job of fleshing out the characters and their feelings about each other and what each believe will give meaning to his/her life.The problem, however, is in the details.  Not only do we have to try and keep track of Takeda's military campaigns, which there are a lot of, and the movie still didn't cover all, including the four Battles of Kawanakajima (movie covered the one battle where Kanosuke was killed), and on the side, follow the relationship between Kanosuke, Shingen and Yu.The end result is that it's like getting little snippets of the personal and professional life of a lord during the Sengoku era, rather than a detailed study of one aspect.",2,A Great Effort but Falls Short,1277510400,"06 26, 2010",2010,1739,"['Dare', 'say', 'where', 'television', 'trumps', 'films', 'story', 'divided', 'parts', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'story', 'Yamamoto', 'Kansuke', 'role', 'Chamberlain', 'Takeda', 'Clan', 'odd', 'love', 'triangle', 'Shingen', 'Princess', 'Yu', 'period', 'twenty', 'years', 'told', '166', 'minutes', 'quite', 'undertaking', 'Add', 'Takeda', 'Shingen', 'was', 'warlord', 'Sengoku', 'era', 'one', 'most', 'complicated', 'periods', 'Japanese', 'history', 'keep', 'straight', 'think', 'true', 'theme', 'film', 'relationship', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'film', 'forced', 'cover', 'entire', 'time', 'period', 'rather', 'just', 'couple', 'military', 'campaigns', 'However', 'covering', 'campaigns', 'drawing', 'Kansuke', 'influence', 'feelings', 'Princess', 'Yu.No', 'criticism', 'acting', 'think', 'Toshiro', 'Mifune', 'peformance', 'film', 'one', 'best', 'well-roundedness', 'character', 'Kinnosuke', 'Nakamura', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'course', 'will', 'say', 'good', 'performance', 'as', 'well', 'Hiroshi', 'Inagaki', 'good', 'job', 'fleshing', 'out', 'characters', 'feelings', 'other', 'what', 'believe', 'will', 'give', 'meaning', 'his/her', 'life.The', 'problem', 'however', 'details', 'Not', 'only', 'do', 'have', 'try', 'keep', 'track', 'Takeda', 'military', 'campaigns', 'are', 'lot', 'movie', 'still', 'did', ""n't"", 'cover', 'including', 'four', 'Battles', 'Kawanakajima', 'movie', 'covered', 'one', 'battle', 'where', 'Kanosuke', 'was', 'killed', 'side', 'follow', 'relationship', 'Kanosuke', 'Shingen', 'Yu.The', 'end', 'result', 'getting', 'little', 'snippets', 'personal', 'professional', 'life', 'lord', 'Sengoku', 'era', 'rather', 'detailed', 'study', 'one', 'aspect']",N/A
