1393257,AXSH6O4OP5L4M,B004AE3QUS,"Atheen M. Wilson ""Atheen""","[1, 1]","Midsomer Murders is one of my all time favorite BBC series, and this set ranks with the best of the collection. The entire format was based on the novels of Caroline Graham, whose first Inspector Barnaby novel, ""The Killings at Badger's Drift,"" was published in 1988 and named as one of The Top 100 Crime Novels of All Time.The tone of the series as a whole is one of dark humor and stark contrasts.  Murders are often spiteful and apropos of the victim's life ways, in short they often get their just deserts.  For all the insanity of the small village murders, their suspects and victims, Barnaby's private life is completely normal.  He argues with his wife over the details of their life together, forgets, remembers or inadvertently misses important events, and manages to make up for his mistakes in agreeable ways.  Joyce is a woman used to doing things alone.  Forced by her husband's career to endure his absence, she has become a strong central character with a life of her own; my favorite statement by Joyce about her policeman husband is that at their wedding, ""Instead of saying 'I do,' he said 'I've got it!'""In this set and as usual, the evil doers are a bit crazy, the victims numerous, and inspector Barnaby quite ingenious. My favorite of the set is ""Secrets and Spies"" which features 007 types in later life; one does tend to wonder what happens to the James Bond types when they hit their late 60s and early 70s).  Here an attempt is made to sideline Barnaby to prevent him from getting too close to the truths behind past deeds kept hidden for years. Frustrated by ""old school ties"" that prevent him from doing his job, he resigns, leaving those now in control to sort things out as more people die. Proving by inaction his value as a skilled policeman and as a brilliant solver of mysteries, he is quickly reinstated and given back control over the case, which is then speedily resolved.  Lovely story.The regular characters are a treat as always. Their interpersonal relationships are a pleasure because they are so normal amidst the insanity of events. Joyce's responses to Barnaby's resignation in ""Secrets and Spies"" is so typical of their life together.  Barnaby may be a genius at crime detection, but to Joyce he's her spouse and treated accordingly and endearingly.Loved it.",5,Midsomer Murders at its best,1315526400,"09 9, 2011",2011,2305,"['Midsomer', 'Murders', 'one', 'time', 'favorite', 'BBC', 'series', 'set', 'best', 'collection', 'entire', 'format', 'was', 'based', 'novels', 'Caroline', 'Graham', 'first', 'Inspector', 'Barnaby', 'novel', 'Killings', 'Badger', 'Drift', 'was', 'published', '1988', 'named', 'one', 'Top', '100', 'Crime', 'Novels', 'All', 'Time.The', 'tone', 'series', 'whole', 'one', 'dark', 'humor', 'stark', 'contrasts', 'Murders', 'are', 'often', 'spiteful', 'apropos', 'victim', 'life', 'ways', 'short', 'often', 'get', 'just', 'deserts', 'insanity', 'small', 'village', 'murders', 'suspects', 'victims', 'Barnaby', 'private', 'life', 'completely', 'normal', 'wife', 'details', 'life', 'together', 'forgets', 'remembers', 'inadvertently', 'important', 'events', 'make', 'up', 'mistakes', 'agreeable', 'ways', 'Joyce', 'woman', 'used', 'doing', 'things', 'alone', 'Forced', 'husband', 'career', 'endure', 'absence', 'become', 'strong', 'central', 'character', 'life', 'own', 'favorite', 'statement', 'Joyce', 'policeman', 'husband', 'wedding', 'Instead', 'saying', 'do', 'said', ""'ve"", 'got', 'set', 'usual', 'evil', 'doers', 'are', 'bit', 'crazy', 'victims', 'numerous', 'inspector', 'Barnaby', 'quite', 'ingenious', 'favorite', 'set', 'Secrets', 'Spies', '007', 'types', 'later', 'life', 'one', 'tend', 'wonder', 'what', 'James', 'Bond', 'types', 'when', 'hit', 'late', '60s', 'early', '70s', 'Here', 'attempt', 'made', 'sideline', 'Barnaby', 'prevent', 'getting', 'too', 'close', 'truths', 'past', 'deeds', 'kept', 'hidden', 'years', 'Frustrated', 'old', 'school', 'ties', 'prevent', 'doing', 'job', 'leaving', 'now', 'control', 'sort', 'things', 'out', 'more', 'people', 'die', 'Proving', 'inaction', 'value', 'skilled', 'policeman', 'brilliant', 'solver', 'mysteries', 'quickly', 'reinstated', 'given', 'back', 'control', 'case', 'then', 'speedily', 'resolved', 'Lovely', 'story.The', 'regular', 'characters', 'are', 'treat', 'always', 'interpersonal', 'relationships', 'are', 'pleasure', 'are', 'so', 'normal', 'insanity', 'events', 'Joyce', 'responses', 'Barnaby', 'resignation', 'Secrets', 'Spies', 'so', 'typical', 'life', 'together', 'Barnaby', 'may', 'be', 'genius', 'crime', 'detection', 'Joyce', 'spouse', 'treated', 'accordingly', 'endearingly.Loved']",Midsomer Murders: Set 17 (The Dogleg Murders / The Black Book / Secrets and Spies / The Glitch)

Again in Set seventeen (17) on four (4) discs running about 1 hour and 40 minutes each, one is not allowed to get too comfortable with the beauty and outward appearance of the locale because behind the doors and garden gates, there are loads of dastardly happenings to a lot of fascinating and sometimes very weird characters that are played by some of Britain's finest and well-known actors.  Be aware that the episode ""The  Black Book"" is really good.  It's all about folks being killed for Forged Art Works with a very surprising ending.In light of the above folks are meeting their demise in a lot of unthought-of, by me, ways.  Of course Barnaby (brilliantly played by John Nettles--he is so very good often very funny and always mild mannered with no barking of orders!) and his assistant (wonderfully  played very  humorously by Jason Hughes who is featured more in set 17) solve the ""who done it"" element brillantly with especially Barnaby's keen insights, intuition and very mellow manner.The viewing of and subsequent enjoyment of the ""Midsomer Murder"" series has been part of my life for many years.

1393284,A8ZY9LI1KBU2P,B004AE3QUS,Mary Kate,"[175, 181]","Based on a set of only seven novels by Caroline Graham (beginning withThe Killings at Badger's Drift), Midsomer Murders is a long-running and very popular series that debuted in the U.K. in 1997. The series features the likable Detective Chief Inspector Tom Barnaby (John Nettles) and is set in the fictional English county of Midsomer which consists of several villages each of which seems to rival Cabot Cove, Maine for their improbably high murder rates.Agatha Christie, the world's most successful mystery writer, considered plot to be of utmost importance when crafting her stories. Graham, on the other hand, has said that she prefers to start out with interesting characters and allow the plot to form around them. And it is certainly the characters that are the centerpiece of Midsomer Murders. Unusual, odd and memorable are all words that could be used to describe the show's colorful collection of villagers - including the murderers, the victims and the bystanders, very few of whom could be described as ""innocent"".Part police procedural, part quirky cozy, part traditional whodunit, Midsomer Murders should appeal to a variety of murder mystery fans. Even after seeing nearly 70 episodes, I find the show remains dependably entertaining with strong writing, intricate plots and uniformly first-rate acting. Episodes exist more or less independent of one another and need not be viewed in broadcast order. However, because of Barnaby's changing Detective Sergeants over the years, viewers might wish to do so.One of my favorite aspects of the series is the gorgeous glimpses it provides of the English countryside and the picturesque villages, vine covered cottages and grand estates in which the stories are set. For true devotees, the bookMidsomer Murders on Locationprovides information on where each episode was filmed. I'm also inordinately fond of the theme music which seems to suit the quirkiness of Midsomer Murders perfectly.The following episodes are included in Set 17:* The Dogleg Murders (Episode 67): After a player is murdered on the course at a prestigious golf club, Barnaby and Jones discover a bevy of crimes, and more murder, among the club's members.* The Black Book (Episode 68): The sale at auction of a newly discovered masterpiece by a Midsomer painter seems to be the catalyst for a series of murders.* Secrets and Spies (Episode 69): Barnaby's past as a secret agent comes into play when another former agent is murdered after a cricket match.* The Glitch (Episode 70): Barnaby suspects that the threat by a local university fellow to reveal a glitch in a new software program mistakenly caused the hit and run killing of a local school teacher.All four episodes have SDH subtitles.Because of the somewhat unorthodox behavior of a number of the characters, some rare flashes of nudity and the often gruesome nature of the crimes, I feel Midsomer Murders is best suited to older teens and adults.Highly recommended.",5,Consistently Entertaining,1288828800,"11 4, 2010",2010,2955,"['Based', 'set', 'only', 'seven', 'novels', 'Caroline', 'Graham', 'beginning', 'withThe', 'Killings', 'Badger', 'Drift', 'Midsomer', 'Murders', 'long-running', 'very', 'popular', 'series', 'debuted', 'U.K.', '1997', 'series', 'likable', 'Detective', 'Chief', 'Inspector', 'Tom', 'Barnaby', 'John', 'Nettles', 'set', 'fictional', 'English', 'county', 'Midsomer', 'several', 'villages', 'rival', 'Cabot', 'Cove', 'Maine', 'improbably', 'high', 'murder', 'rates.Agatha', 'Christie', 'world', 'most', 'successful', 'mystery', 'writer', 'considered', 'plot', 'be', 'utmost', 'importance', 'when', 'crafting', 'stories', 'Graham', 'other', 'hand', 'said', 'start', 'out', 'interesting', 'characters', 'allow', 'plot', 'form', 'around', 'certainly', 'characters', 'are', 'centerpiece', 'Midsomer', 'Murders', 'Unusual', 'odd', 'memorable', 'are', 'words', 'could', 'be', 'used', 'describe', 'show', 'colorful', 'collection', 'villagers', 'including', 'murderers', 'victims', 'bystanders', 'very', 'few', 'whom', 'could', 'be', 'described', 'innocent', '.Part', 'police', 'procedural', 'part', 'quirky', 'cozy', 'part', 'traditional', 'whodunit', 'Midsomer', 'Murders', 'should', 'appeal', 'variety', 'murder', 'mystery', 'fans', 'Even', 'seeing', 'nearly', '70', 'episodes', 'find', 'show', 'dependably', 'entertaining', 'strong', 'writing', 'intricate', 'plots', 'uniformly', 'first-rate', 'acting', 'Episodes', 'exist', 'more', 'less', 'independent', 'one', 'need', 'not', 'be', 'viewed', 'broadcast', 'order', 'However', 'Barnaby', 'changing', 'Detective', 'Sergeants', 'years', 'viewers', 'might', 'wish', 'do', 'so.One', 'favorite', 'aspects', 'series', 'gorgeous', 'glimpses', 'English', 'countryside', 'picturesque', 'villages', 'vine', 'covered', 'cottages', 'grand', 'estates', 'stories', 'are', 'set', 'true', 'devotees', 'bookMidsomer', 'Murders', 'Locationprovides', 'information', 'where', 'episode', 'was', 'filmed', ""'m"", 'also', 'inordinately', 'fond', 'theme', 'music', 'suit', 'quirkiness', 'Midsomer', 'Murders', 'perfectly.The', 'following', 'episodes', 'are', 'included', 'Set', '17', '*', 'Dogleg', 'Murders', 'Episode', '67', 'player', 'murdered', 'course', 'prestigious', 'golf', 'club', 'Barnaby', 'Jones', 'discover', 'bevy', 'crimes', 'more', 'murder', 'club', 'members', '*', 'Black', 'Book', 'Episode', '68', 'sale', 'auction', 'newly', 'discovered', 'masterpiece', 'Midsomer', 'painter', 'be', 'catalyst', 'series', 'murders', '*', 'Secrets', 'Spies', 'Episode', '69', 'Barnaby', 'past', 'secret', 'agent', 'play', 'when', 'former', 'agent', 'murdered', 'cricket', 'match', '*', 'Glitch', 'Episode', '70', 'Barnaby', 'threat', 'local', 'university', 'fellow', 'reveal', 'glitch', 'new', 'software', 'program', 'mistakenly', 'caused', 'hit', 'run', 'killing', 'local', 'school', 'four', 'episodes', 'have', 'SDH', 'subtitles.Because', 'somewhat', 'unorthodox', 'behavior', 'number', 'characters', 'rare', 'flashes', 'nudity', 'often', 'gruesome', 'nature', 'crimes', 'feel', 'Midsomer', 'Murders', 'best', 'suited', 'older', 'teens', 'adults.Highly', 'recommended']",Midsomer Murders: Set 17 (The Dogleg Murders / The Black Book / Secrets and Spies / The Glitch)

In the county of Midsomer, things aren't always what they seem, and there is murder lurking behind many of the well trimmed hedges.

Each episode stands on its own and offers its own unique and suspenseful storyline. This particular box set includes four exciting episodes including:The Dogleg Murders ---Members of the Swanky Golf Club keep turning up dead on the 13th hole.The Black Book--A string of savage murders take place at a local art auction.Secrets and Spies--A mysterious creature starts out killing sheep but soon moves onto larger prey...The Glitch---A local scientist tries to stop an American millionaire's latest business venture with fatal results.The series brings together an all star cast including John Nettles as the Detective Chief Inspector Tom Barnaby and Jason Hughes as his protege, Detective Sergeant Ben Jones.

1393289,A1BD1HWB495S0U,B004AE3QUS,PhoneConnoisseur,"[0, 0]","We are nearing the end of John Nettles' portrayal of the indefatigable DCI Tom Barnaby.  Yet, he has aged very little since the series started in 1997.  The four stories are just as we now expect them--quirky people living in Midsomer, horrific murders, and with the truly valuable aid of DI Ben Jones (Jason Hughes).  I actually believe that after having a new, not formally educated DS Troy who was truly a grunt (but a nice and good grunt), and DS Scott (John Hopkins) who was sent down from the Met for doing something we are never told, Barnaby is now a better DCI because of the intelligence of Ben Jones who is more a help than a hindrance to solving the crimes.The colleague/colleague relationship rather than the father/son relationship with the other two, has now mellowed into a fine wine, with a great body, a superior nose and a wonderful taste on the tongue.  Thankfully, there will be probably three more sets to come out before Tom retires and his relation (I think cousin), John Barnaby (Neil Dudgeon) replaces him.  After 13 years of watching Midsomer Murders and watching and re-watching the DVDs, we Americans, as usual fall in love with Buckinghamshire, where most of the stores are filmed.  We love to see homes and estates that are not usually a part of the typical American landscape and I think we lose ourselves in the background, even though over 200+ murders and suicides have been committed in must one county in Britain.If only Morse could have had more episodes to watch; but since only 33 were made and Nettles will have made 82 episodes when he leaves.  There is no telling how many Dudgeon will make, but if the stories can remain fresh as I think they will, I am hoping for another 82 to watch.So, now is on to Set 18, 19 and 20.  Many a tear will be shed when TB's final episode is watched just as it was when Troy left when he became a DI.  Thank, John, for 82 great episodes and to all the great writers and actors many of whom are making their second appearance.A great buy!",5,Another Great Set of One of Britain's Best Police Shows,1298764800,"02 27, 2011",2011,2013,"['are', 'nearing', 'end', 'John', 'Nettles', 'portrayal', 'indefatigable', 'DCI', 'Tom', 'Barnaby', 'aged', 'very', 'little', 'series', 'started', '1997', 'four', 'stories', 'are', 'just', 'now', 'expect', 'quirky', 'people', 'living', 'Midsomer', 'horrific', 'murders', 'truly', 'valuable', 'aid', 'DI', 'Ben', 'Jones', 'Jason', 'Hughes', 'actually', 'believe', 'having', 'new', 'not', 'formally', 'educated', 'DS', 'Troy', 'who', 'was', 'truly', 'grunt', 'nice', 'good', 'grunt', 'DS', 'Scott', 'John', 'Hopkins', 'who', 'was', 'sent', 'down', 'Met', 'doing', 'something', 'are', 'never', 'told', 'Barnaby', 'now', 'better', 'DCI', 'intelligence', 'Ben', 'Jones', 'who', 'more', 'help', 'hindrance', 'solving', 'crimes.The', 'colleague/colleague', 'relationship', 'rather', 'father/son', 'relationship', 'other', 'two', 'now', 'mellowed', 'fine', 'wine', 'great', 'body', 'superior', 'nose', 'wonderful', 'taste', 'tongue', 'Thankfully', 'will', 'be', 'probably', 'three', 'more', 'sets', 'come', 'out', 'Tom', 'retires', 'relation', 'think', 'cousin', 'John', 'Barnaby', 'Neil', 'Dudgeon', '13', 'years', 'watching', 'Midsomer', 'Murders', 'watching', 're-watching', 'DVDs', 'Americans', 'usual', 'fall', 'love', 'Buckinghamshire', 'where', 'most', 'stores', 'are', 'filmed', 'love', 'see', 'homes', 'estates', 'are', 'not', 'usually', 'part', 'typical', 'American', 'landscape', 'think', 'lose', 'background', 'even', '200+', 'murders', 'suicides', 'have', 'been', 'committed', 'must', 'one', 'county', 'Britain.If', 'only', 'Morse', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'episodes', 'watch', 'only', '33', 'were', 'made', 'Nettles', 'will', 'have', 'made', '82', 'episodes', 'when', 'telling', 'how', 'many', 'Dudgeon', 'will', 'make', 'stories', 'can', 'remain', 'fresh', 'think', 'will', 'am', 'hoping', '82', 'watch.So', 'now', 'Set', '18', '19', '20', 'tear', 'will', 'be', 'shed', 'when', 'TB', 'final', 'episode', 'watched', 'just', 'was', 'when', 'Troy', 'left', 'when', 'became', 'DI', 'Thank', 'John', '82', 'great', 'episodes', 'great', 'writers', 'actors', 'many', 'whom', 'are', 'making', 'second', 'appearance.A', 'great', 'buy']",Midsomer Murders: Set 17 (The Dogleg Murders / The Black Book / Secrets and Spies / The Glitch)
