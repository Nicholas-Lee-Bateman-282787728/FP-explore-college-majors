748903,A141HP4LYPWMSR,B00008WT3R,Brian E. Erland,"[18, 18]","The year is 1947, the place an Irish Catholic neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York. Michael (Peter Tambakis) finds himself caught in a freak snowstorm one August afternoon and steps into a nearby doorway to warm up. Once inside he encounters a bearded man named Judah (Stephen Rea), a lonely, disillusioned rabbi recently arrived from Czechoslovakia.They become friends and before long Judah is sharing his Jewish faith with the young boy along with wonderous tales of kabbalistic folklore and mysticism. However Michael soon discovers that some people in the neighborhood don't approve of his new acquaintance, or others of the Jewish faith for that matter. For the first time in his short life Michael is exposed to anti-semitic behavior by a group of local teenagers. When the rabbi is badly beaten by one of the bullies Michael looks for a way to stop the violence.He asks the rabbi if the stories he has been telling him are true, or at least one in particular. A medieval tale about a Golem, an artifical creation made of clay fashioned in human form. A creature of immense strength that according to legend could be brought to life through a prescribed set of Hebrew prayers and rituals. It would be a 'Warrior of God' that could stand against the neighborhood bullies. He asks Judah if it's possible. Responding with a hesitant maybe, Michael is off to attempt the unimaginable.""Snow in August"" was made on a small budget for television and it shows in the production values. However if you stay with it you'll discover that the story is really quite good and its message of tolerance and understanding is one we should never get tired of hearing.",3,When The Shofar Sounds The Faithful Will Gather  ~  A Golem In Brooklyn,1125014400,"08 26, 2005",2005,1653,"['year', '1947', 'place', 'Irish', 'Catholic', 'neighborhood', 'Brooklyn', 'New', 'York', 'Michael', 'Peter', 'Tambakis', 'caught', 'freak', 'snowstorm', 'one', 'August', 'afternoon', 'steps', 'nearby', 'doorway', 'warm', 'up', 'Once', 'bearded', 'man', 'named', 'Judah', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'lonely', 'disillusioned', 'rabbi', 'recently', 'arrived', 'Czechoslovakia.They', 'become', 'friends', 'long', 'Judah', 'sharing', 'Jewish', 'faith', 'young', 'boy', 'wonderous', 'tales', 'kabbalistic', 'folklore', 'mysticism', 'However', 'Michael', 'soon', 'people', 'neighborhood', 'do', ""n't"", 'approve', 'new', 'acquaintance', 'others', 'Jewish', 'faith', 'matter', 'first', 'time', 'short', 'life', 'Michael', 'exposed', 'anti-semitic', 'behavior', 'group', 'local', 'teenagers', 'When', 'rabbi', 'badly', 'beaten', 'one', 'bullies', 'Michael', 'way', 'stop', 'violence.He', 'rabbi', 'stories', 'been', 'telling', 'are', 'true', 'least', 'one', 'particular', 'medieval', 'tale', 'Golem', 'artifical', 'creation', 'made', 'clay', 'fashioned', 'human', 'form', 'creature', 'immense', 'strength', 'according', 'legend', 'could', 'be', 'brought', 'life', 'prescribed', 'set', 'Hebrew', 'prayers', 'rituals', 'would', 'be', ""'Warrior"", 'God', 'could', 'stand', 'neighborhood', 'bullies', 'Judah', 'possible', 'Responding', 'hesitant', 'maybe', 'Michael', 'attempt', 'unimaginable', 'Snow', 'August', 'was', 'made', 'small', 'budget', 'television', 'production', 'values', 'However', 'stay', ""'ll"", 'discover', 'story', 'really', 'quite', 'good', 'message', 'tolerance', 'understanding', 'one', 'should', 'never', 'get', 'tired', 'hearing']",Snow in August
748904,AW1AELBVKBFTD,B00008WT3R,"Judith A. Carlson ""avid reader""","[8, 8]","This movie teaches a lot about how hateful prejudice and stereotypes can be (in this case, antisemitism). It is a movie about how a little boy learns that what he thought was so was completely wrong. It shows how a friendship can blossom between two people of diverse cultures who are also very far apart in age...and how they can learn from each other to the mutual benefit of not only both of them, but for an entire neighborhood. Furthermore, it is as close to the original book as I have ever seen.

748906,A3AJIDYRTJL7RE,B00008WT3R,Stephen M. Keohane,"[1, 1]","It has a bit of about everything. Christianity meets our Cousin Judaism in this movie. A young Catholic kid befriends a sweet Jewish Rabbi, after he witnesses an Irish hoodlum/gang member beat an old Jewish storekeeper near to death. The kid makes the wrong decision and decides not to be a ""stooley"" and he and his Irish mother, and his dear friend, the Rabbi pay the price. If you don't know what a ""Golem"" is (or Kabbala is) then you will in this movie.  The Catholic kid creates a Golem after the Rabbi tell him how - by speaking the true name of God and using a magical spoon - over a earthen/clay, rather large figure. A Golem knows how to protect and stop attacks on Jews. It instinctively and/or is programed to know. Just as Michael the Archangel protects Israel.This movie shows how to make the wrong decision by protecting bullies. And worse - the error of continuing to protect them, when they know you can put them away for the crimes they commit. You are then in their eyes a serious threat. And your life - and the lives of your family are then in serious danger. A childlike FAITH is what makes it all happen. /s/ Steve @ BibleProbe.com",5,Great movie!
