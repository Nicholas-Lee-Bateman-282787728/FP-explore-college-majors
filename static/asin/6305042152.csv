444995,A1EBOEB2DXOMIK,6305042152,"Amazon Customer ""C. Dennis Moore""","[2, 3]","Some people just can't mind their own business.It's 1806 and Lt. Andre Duvalier (played by a 26-year-old Jack Nicholson), a soldier in the French army, has been separated from his regiment. He winds up on a beach somewhere where he meets a mysterious woman who says her name is Helene (Sandra Knight, Nicholson's then-wife). After the woman vanishes, Duvalier is attacked by a bird and passes out. When he wakes, he finds himself in the shack of Katrina, an old woman who insists there is no woman named Helene. Her son Gustav, however, indicates otherwise and prompts Duvalier to seek the truth in the castle of Baron von Leppe (Boris Karloff).Duvalier makes his way to the castle, but finds the Baron no more forthcoming than the old woman. And the Baron's valet Stefan is a big roadblock as well.Determined to get to the bottom of the mysterious woman--literally, as it seems the only thing Duvalier truly wants is some action--the lieutenant stops at nothing to uncover every secret of the Castle von Leppe, even if it means damnation for all involved.You know, you think you've got a good thing going. Your checkered past is where it belongs, in the past, and you're doing a good job of putting it all behind you. You're not hurting anyone. And then one day some stranger bursts in and, without so much as a by-your-leave, proceeds to tear down every wall you've built to keep those secrets hidden. Just to satisfy his libido.As it happens, Helene is really Ilsa, the Baronness von Leppe, whom the Baron himself killed twenty years earlier when he returned unannounced from the war and found her with her lover, Eric. However, as Duvalier later discovers, even that isn't the end of the story. Soon Katrina's motives, Helene's desire, and Stefan's secrets are all revealed as the crypt beneath the castle floods, leaving the Baron with his guilt and his tortured soul.THE TERROR? Only if you intend to make me sit through it again, because I will hurt you. It's so hard to imagine this movie was made with any serious intent. Then again, it's a Roger Corman movie, made on the heels of his movie THE RAVEN, using the same sets and actors, filmed in only a few days because, well, he had the sets and the actors for a few days more, why not shoot another movie?The result answers that question for itself. THE TERROR is all the proof you need that, just because you've got the resources at hand, doesn't mean you need to make a movie. What's worse, there are FIVE directors credited with this movie (only Corman appears in the credits, but apparently he had help from Monte Hellman--now that's a cool name, HELLMAN!--Jack Hill--one of the ""writers"" of this thing--as well as Jack Nicholson and friggin' Francis Ford Coppola). Five directors? That's gotta be some sort of typo, because I was hard pressed to find evidence of even one director. For large chunks of the movie, I got the feeling the cameraman hit record and sat back to have a sandwich and only happened to get a few shots of people running through a dry--and I mean DRY--read. This movie was obviously made before Nicholson had taken up acting, and apparently long after Karloff had given it up. Honestly, I half-expected the credits to be chock full of Alan Smithees. With FRANKENSTEIN and THE SHINING on their respective resumes, Karloff and Nicholson are horror legends. THE TERROR begs the question whether that's a genre-wide distinction or just a case of these actors having happened to make two very popular horror movies, because there is absolutely no spark of greatness from either in this movie.Nicholson's Duvalier is not only wooden, but also a very unlikable character. He's intrusive, arrogant, nosey. He spends the majority of the movie skulking around Castle von Leppe, going through rooms, searching every corner and cranny, even refusing to leave when he's ordered to--TWICE!And the dialogue these people spout. Sweet Christmas!Here's an excerpt I took from IMDB between Duvalier and Helene:Helene: The crypt! It must be destroyed, and with it the dead.Andre: Don't speak of the dead anymore. You're with me now.Helene: I am possessed of the dead.Andre: You're a warm living woman. Who has told you these things?Helene: The dead.Now read it again, only this time remove any indication of emotion or wakefulness and you'll get a clue as to the delivery the actors gave. Try taking a valium before you read it, that ought to help.I know better than to watch a Roger Corman movie with anything other than the least of expectations, but come on. At least CREATURE FROM THE HAUNTED SEA was funny, and it seemed intentional. THE TERROR's not even that. It's just 81 minutes of BOR-RING!!!A horror classic? That depends on what kind of influence it may have had on what came after it. Considering it's been said that even the crap is educational because it teaches you what not to do, then, sure I can see THE TERROR having some kind of influence; what filmmaker in their right mind would ever want to make something resembling this? However, if you're talking honest horror genre influence, as in people saw it and, not only wanted more just like it, but wanted to be responsible for making it, then no, I can't see that.",1,The

Even though it's called ""The Terror"", it doesn't seem like a terror movie, but it is still entertaining. Jack Nicholson starred in this one (he was young then, just like in the original ""Little Shop of Horrors"" he was in before this one), and he played a Napoleon soldier. His then-wife, Sandra Knight, played Helene who was a ""ghost"" in the movie, and Boris Karloff, a famous horror movie actor, played the Baron.This movie is a little phony, like the ""witch"" in the movie...and how she died. I never dreamed that lightning can burn a witch to a crisp like in this movie, just because she saw the hawk flying in the sky! Same thing at the ending when Nicholson kissed the beautiful Helene, who then melted on the ground, revealing her skeleton. Nice special effects in the 1960s...I give them (and Roger Corman) credit for that.This is a good movie, although not Oscar-winning, to watch on a rainy day for fun.",4,"Not Really a ""Terror"", But It's Still Good!",1053820800,"05 25, 2003",2003,980,"['have', 'watched', 'movie', 'twice', 'TV', 'past', 'enjoyed', 'Even', 'called', 'Terror', ""n't"", 'seem', 'terror', 'movie', 'still', 'entertaining', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'starred', 'one', 'was', 'young', 'then', 'just', 'original', 'Little', 'Shop', 'Horrors', 'was', 'one', 'played', 'Napoleon', 'soldier', 'then-wife', 'Sandra', 'Knight', 'played', 'Helene', 'who', 'was', 'ghost', 'movie', 'Boris', 'Karloff', 'famous', 'horror', 'movie', 'actor', 'played', 'Baron.This', 'movie', 'little', 'phony', 'witch', 'movie', 'how', 'died', 'never', 'dreamed', 'lightning', 'can', 'burn', 'witch', 'crisp', 'movie', 'just', 'saw', 'hawk', 'flying', 'sky', 'Same', 'thing', 'ending', 'when', 'Nicholson', 'kissed', 'beautiful', 'Helene', 'who', 'then', 'melted', 'ground', 'revealing', 'skeleton', 'Nice', 'special', 'effects', '1960s', 'give', 'Roger', 'Corman', 'credit', 'that.This', 'good', 'movie', 'not', 'Oscar-winning', 'watch', 'rainy', 'day', 'fun']",N/A

He's met a mysterious girl who just might be a ghost! Von Leppe is pretty mysterious too! He's been in the castle for 20 years after murdering his adulterous wife, Ilsa. Is Ilsa the same girl that Jack ran into? And what about the strange witch who lives near the castle? And the hawk that seems to possess human intelligence? THE TERROR is one of Roger Corman's better films, leaving his infamous rubber monsters behind, in order to get under our skin with creeping undercurrents of fear and dread. Nicholson is great, actually showing some of the snearing stuff that would one day make him a megastar. Karloff is himself, in one of his better latter-day performances.

444998,A1TONI9A0YFOD6,6305042152,Bruce Rux,"[5, 6]","The history of the movie is far more interesting than the movie, itself.  Corman had three extra days after his prematurely wrapped The Raven shoot, and tossed this thing together off the top of his (and everybody else's) head to end up making two features for the price of one.  Considering the circumstances, the thing is a masterpiece.Of course, the finished product neither knows nor cares about the circumstances, which is why this movie is doubly entertaining.  The mix of costuming and acting styles, the endless anachronisms throwing the audience out of suspension of disbelief that they are in Napoleonic era Germany (or is it supposed to be Spain? and if so, why so many German names? and if not, where does one get a seaside cliff in Germany?)  -  not to mention the genuinely really bad acting from pretty much everyone involved (including Karloff, who almost certainly didn't take it seriously), and the grossly mixed accents of the cast  -  make this one endlessly entertaining, in that drop-your-jaw, I-can't-believe-adult-human-beings-actually-got-together-and-made-this-thing kind of way.It actually has a plot, which if you're really attentive and diligent you can pick out in the last five minutes of the movie, and if you do, it's terribly clever and grossly improbable, which just makes it all that much more fun.But you won't care about that.  What you really want to see is Jack Nicholson performing flatter than a block of wood, his then-wife Sandra Knight with an accent and acting style flatter still (though she is quite beautiful), Dorothy Neumann as a cackling revenge-driven old witch, Bronx-accented Dick Miller as a supposedly very German manservant, and Karloff struggling to keep a straight face given all the preceding impediments.Nicholson happily confesses in interviews that they all had a ball making this wonderfully absurd movie, and it actually shows.  Interestingly enough, if you're in the right mood, you can even see the horror movie this almost was, if they'd had more time to make it really work.  There are some good gore effects  -  a man's eyes gouged out by a killer hawk, and an incredibly goopy melting woman, topping the list  -  and it's pretty handsomely produced, even with a decently eerie musical soundtrack throughout.Don't watch it because it's good  -  watch it because it's FUN.",3,"Yes, Adult Human Beings Really Got Together and Made This!",1031356800,"09 7, 2002",2002,2342,"['history', 'movie', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'movie', 'Corman', 'had', 'three', 'extra', 'days', 'prematurely', 'wrapped', 'Raven', 'shoot', 'tossed', 'thing', 'together', 'top', 'everybody', 'else', 'head', 'end', 'up', 'making', 'two', 'features', 'price', 'one', 'Considering', 'circumstances', 'thing', 'masterpiece.Of', 'course', 'finished', 'product', 'knows', 'cares', 'circumstances', 'why', 'movie', 'doubly', 'entertaining', 'mix', 'costuming', 'acting', 'styles', 'endless', 'anachronisms', 'throwing', 'audience', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'are', 'Napoleonic', 'era', 'Germany', 'supposed', 'be', 'Spain', 'so', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'German', 'names', 'not', 'where', 'one', 'get', 'seaside', 'cliff', 'Germany', 'not', 'mention', 'genuinely', 'really', 'bad', 'acting', 'pretty', 'much', 'everyone', 'involved', 'including', 'Karloff', 'who', 'almost', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'seriously', 'grossly', 'mixed', 'accents', 'cast', 'make', 'one', 'endlessly', 'entertaining', 'drop-your-jaw', ""I-can't-believe-adult-human-beings-actually-got-together-and-made-this-thing"", 'kind', 'way.It', 'actually', 'plot', ""'re"", 'really', 'attentive', 'diligent', 'can', 'pick', 'out', 'last', 'five', 'minutes', 'movie', 'do', 'terribly', 'clever', 'grossly', 'improbable', 'just', 'that', 'much', 'more', 'fun.But', 'wo', ""n't"", 'care', 'What', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'performing', 'flatter', 'block', 'wood', 'then-wife', 'Sandra', 'Knight', 'accent', 'acting', 'style', 'flatter', 'still', 'quite', 'beautiful', 'Dorothy', 'Neumann', 'cackling', 'revenge-driven', 'old', 'witch', 'Bronx-accented', 'Dick', 'Miller', 'supposedly', 'very', 'German', 'manservant', 'Karloff', 'struggling', 'keep', 'straight', 'face', 'given', 'preceding', 'impediments.Nicholson', 'happily', 'interviews', 'had', 'ball', 'making', 'wonderfully', 'absurd', 'movie', 'actually', 'Interestingly', 'enough', ""'re"", 'right', 'mood', 'can', 'even', 'see', 'horror', 'movie', 'almost', 'was', ""'d"", 'had', 'more', 'time', 'make', 'really', 'work', 'are', 'good', 'gore', 'effects', 'man', 'eyes', 'gouged', 'out', 'killer', 'hawk', 'incredibly', 'goopy', 'melting', 'woman', 'topping', 'list', 'pretty', 'handsomely', 'produced', 'even', 'decently', 'eerie', 'musical', 'soundtrack', 'throughout.Do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'good', 'watch', 'FUN']",N/A

Of course, I can't help but think he had a little bit of help by a young associate producer named Francis Coppola.  As for the film itself, it definitely deserves its cult horror film status.  It features Boris Karloff, it maintains a wonderfully gloomy atmosphere throughout, boasts some pretty decent special effects, and it actually features a good story with some surprising twists and turns at the end.  It also stars a young Jack Nicholson, which certainly helps its popularity - unfortunately, though, this is probably Nicholson's worst performance ever, as he sometimes rushes through his lines without immersing himself in the character.Nicholson plays Andre Duvalier, a French soldier who has become separated from his unit.  You can tell he's French because he wears a fancy uniform but doesn't seem inclined to actually engage in any sort of battle, is rather rude to those he meets, and basically expects everyone to do whatever he commands of them.  Andre meets a young lady named Helene as he is wandering along some coastline and apparently falls in love with her - despite the fact she keeps disappearing and just possibly tries to lead him to his death.  He ends up being cared for by a strange old woman, who tells him there is no girl in that area.  Still, he persists in finding Helene, eventually tracking her to a spooky old castle.  There, he meets Baron von Leppe (Karloff) and learns that the girl he saw is the spitting image of the Baron's wife, who has been dead for twenty years.  He eventually learns the story of the Baroness' violent death, but he just doesn't believe that the woman he met is actually a ghost.  The Baroness' death all those years ago does stand at the heart of the story, but the truth is more complicated than you might think.  The film sort of plods along for awhile, but the final twenty minutes play out wonderfully.  You may think you know what is really going on, but odds are that you will meet with a surprise or two before all is said and done - I know I did.  There is one plot point that is a little hard to swallow for reasons that will be obvious to the viewer, but overall I would declare this film an unqualified success.The story behind this movie has become something of a legend.  It seems that Corman wrapped up filming The Raven a few days early, and so he decided to make another film on the spot.  The rush job origins of the film explain some of the anachronisms that crop up, but it seems obvious to me that Corman did his best work when he didn't have time to really think about what he was doing.  Some critics have referred to The Terror as a movie without a plot.  Apparently, only a partial script was written on the spot - specifically, those scenes filmed on the set of The Raven.

Despite its unusual and rushed origins, though, I found The Terror to be an impressive, strongly plot-driven film.

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","It makes sense that THE TERROR is more Boris Karloff's vehicle than it is Jack Nicholson's, seeing as how it came out in 1963, a period in which Jack was still trying to make a name for himself. Jack Nicholson plays Andre Duvalier, a French lieutenant in Napoleon's army who, in 1806, was separated from his regiment. We first catch a glimpse of him as he slowly negotiates a beach on his horse, parched and low spirited. When he espies a mysterious girl (Sandra Knight), he eventually - after getting sidetracked in an old hag's hut - tracks her to the castle of the reclusive Baron Victor von Leppe. ""I'm a weary, disillusioned soldier, and you're the only pleasant sight that I've seen in seven months."" Pretty words coming out of his mouth, and the girl laughs at this, and you think there's a lucky fella. But once he reaches the castle and you identify Karloff as the Baron, you know in your bones that Nicholson, poor man, is in for a very bad time.It's produced and directed by Roger Corman, and so you understand the schlock factor and the limitations that go with that. THE TERROR is a pretty unnerving tale... if you were watching it in 1963. Today, the scares come off as fairly tame, the shocking moments don't quite tingle that old spine. It won't make you cower like Nicholson's later and more disturbing film did, THE SHINING, which is Jack's opus in terror. Still, credit this B-movie for mustering and sustaining a foreboding atmosphere. When young Andre falls in love with that girl he'd followed, and when he learns that she may be possessed by dark forces, there's nothing but for him to brave the ominous castle. It's immediately evident that the old Baron is a deeply private man, yet age-old proprieties dictate that he welcomes Andre as a guest. Andre promptly begins nosing around and is soon exposed to spooky happenings. My rule of thumb in such situations: When there's spooky stuff in the house, get out of the house. I don't know, sometimes, love just ain't worth it, man.I relished THE TERROR for the curio piece that it is. It certainly didn't make me jump. There isn't much of the Jack Nicholson we'll come to know and love. He was a young actor back then and probably minding his P's and Q's and still learning his craft. There's none of that sense of danger he normally exuded, the sense that, uh oh, this guy is gonna do something unpredictable any minute now. Jack in this movie plays the conventional male lead in a horror picture. He's square-jawed and brave and he perseveres. It's actually really interesting, given the contrast to the memorable anti-hero parts Jack'll pull in later in his career. Karloff plays it to the hilt as the weary, broken-hearted, old Baron who keenly pines away for his lost love. A lost love who's come back as a disquieting haunt. It's a strange love triangle. It could never end well. There is also a witch, possibly wicked, possibly nursing an agenda, hovering in the periphery. She may have cackled once or twice. There is also a fearsome attacking bird that Hitchcock, if he'd seen it, would've promptly sicced on Tippi Hedren.",3,"""Heeeeeere's Karloff!""",1360800000,"02 14, 2013",2013,3103,"['sense', 'THE', 'TERROR', 'more', 'Boris', 'Karloff', 'vehicle', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'seeing', 'how', 'came', 'out', '1963', 'period', 'Jack', 'was', 'still', 'trying', 'make', 'name', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Andre', 'Duvalier', 'French', 'lieutenant', 'Napoleon', 'army', 'who', '1806', 'was', 'separated', 'regiment', 'first', 'catch', 'glimpse', 'slowly', 'beach', 'horse', 'parched', 'low', 'spirited', 'When', 'mysterious', 'girl', 'Sandra', 'Knight', 'eventually', 'getting', 'sidetracked', 'old', 'hag', 'hut', 'castle', 'reclusive', 'Baron', 'Victor', 'von', 'Leppe', ""'m"", 'weary', 'disillusioned', 'soldier', ""'re"", 'only', 'pleasant', 'sight', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'seven', 'months', 'Pretty', 'words', 'coming', 'mouth', 'girl', 'think', 'lucky', 'fella', 'once', 'castle', 'identify', 'Karloff', 'Baron', 'know', 'bones', 'Nicholson', 'poor', 'man', 'very', 'bad', 'time.It', 'produced', 'directed', 'Roger', 'Corman', 'so', 'understand', 'schlock', 'factor', 'limitations', 'go', 'TERROR', 'pretty', 'unnerving', 'tale', 'were', 'watching', '1963', 'Today', 'scares', 'come', 'off', 'fairly', 'tame', 'shocking', 'moments', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'tingle', 'old', 'spine', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'cower', 'Nicholson', 'later', 'more', 'disturbing', 'film', 'did', 'THE', 'SHINING', 'Jack', 'opus', 'terror', 'Still', 'credit', 'B-movie', 'mustering', 'sustaining', 'foreboding', 'atmosphere', 'When', 'young', 'Andre', 'love', 'girl', ""'d"", 'followed', 'when', 'may', 'be', 'possessed', 'dark', 'forces', 'nothing', 'brave', 'ominous', 'castle', 'immediately', 'evident', 'old', 'Baron', 'deeply', 'private', 'man', 'yet', 'age-old', 'proprieties', 'dictate', 'Andre', 'guest', 'Andre', 'promptly', 'nosing', 'around', 'soon', 'exposed', 'spooky', 'happenings', 'rule', 'thumb', 'such', 'situations', 'When', 'spooky', 'stuff', 'house', 'get', 'house', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'sometimes', 'love', 'just', 'ai', ""n't"", 'worth', 'man.I', 'relished', 'THE', 'TERROR', 'curio', 'piece', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'jump', ""n't"", 'much', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', ""'ll"", 'come', 'know', 'love', 'was', 'young', 'actor', 'back', 'then', 'probably', 'minding', 'P', 'Q', 'still', 'learning', 'craft', 'none', 'sense', 'danger', 'normally', 'exuded', 'sense', 'uh', 'oh', 'guy', 'gon', 'do', 'something', 'unpredictable', 'minute', 'now', 'Jack', 'movie', 'conventional', 'male', 'lead', 'horror', 'picture', 'square-jawed', 'brave', 'actually', 'really', 'interesting', 'given', 'contrast', 'memorable', 'anti-hero', 'parts', 'Jack', ""'ll"", 'pull', 'later', 'career', 'Karloff', 'hilt', 'weary', 'broken-hearted', 'old', 'Baron', 'who', 'keenly', 'away', 'lost', 'love', 'lost', 'love', 'who', 'come', 'back', 'disquieting', 'haunt', 'strange', 'love', 'triangle', 'could', 'never', 'end', 'well', 'also', 'witch', 'possibly', 'wicked', 'possibly', 'nursing', 'agenda', 'hovering', 'periphery', 'may', 'have', 'cackled', 'once', 'twice', 'also', 'fearsome', 'attacking', 'bird', 'Hitchcock', ""'d"", 'seen', 'would', ""'ve"", 'promptly', 'sicced', 'Tippi', 'Hedren']",N/A

445010,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,6305042152,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[5, 6]","Roger Corman, the king of schlock, finished ""The Raven"" ahead of schedule and decided to make another film on the same set.  Corman and four other directors filmed ""The Terror"" in four days.  The result is mixed and horror movie fans are divided as to whether this film is a cult classic or another schlock horror film of the early 1960's.The story is relatively simple.  Lt. Andre Duvalier (Jack Nicholson) has become separated from his unit.  He encounters a beautiful and mysterious woman on the beach.  He eventually learns her name is Hellene (Sandra Knight).  After wandering about, Duvalier encounters an old lady who is mysterious in the way of old ladies in horror movies.  The old lady insists there is no beautiful and mysterious woman wandering about in this area, but Nicholson was in love so he went off to the nearby castle.  The castle is a suitably creepy place inhabited by Baron Victor Frederick Von Leppe and his assistant Stefan (Dick Miller, who appeared in movies such as ""The Howling"" and ""Small Soldiers,"" and continues to act as of the date of this review).Duvalier quickly realizes that the castle is a creepy place.  His mysterious woman appears and disappears.  There are secret rooms.  There is a dead body in the basement.  Baron Von Leppe and Stefan are always skulking about.  The unfortunate part of this portion of the movie is that it is all about atmosphere and very little about advancing the plot.The movie picks up in the last 15 minutes or so, and a lot of questions get answered.  Unfortunately, there are some new questions asked and some questions never get answered fully.  On the other hand, the action picks up a lot near the end of the movie and the movie has a surprise or two for its audience.On the plus side, Karloff is incredible in this film.  He is mysterious and moody and you sense there is something driving his character, Baron Victor Frederick Von Leppe.  The castle is also great, which is probably why Corman decided to film another movie in it after ""The Raven.""  Sandra Knight, then married to Jack Nicholson, was also great as Helene and the ghost of the Baroness.On the negative side, Jack Nicholson still had some things to learn about acting.  Nicholson often rushes his lines and his overacted character is almost a distraction.  I wonder what would have happened had Nicholson's character been written out of the movie.  The other partially negative aspect of this movie is the almost total lack of plot.  I say partially because the lack of plot makes this movie a moody atmospheric film.  I got the feeling that Baron Von Leppe's story had been going on for some time and Lt. Andre Duvalier (Nicholson) had arrived late in the final chapters.As I noted above, people see this movie one of two ways.  Some people see this movie as a dragging, plotless bore.  Other people see this movie as an artistic, moody period piece with masterful acting by Karloff.  You will have to watch this movie to decide how you interpret this movie.

Movies are generally fictional and what you see in them is usually not really what it's supposed to be. It's a quite good film, The Terror, as the sets are beautiful and very convincing of early 19th century Europe. Just what anach-ronisms the film possesses escape me. Karloff's bathrobe maybe?

445012,A157XTSMJH9XA4,6305042152,One of many,"[2, 2]","The Terror is a 1963 horror film (actually in color!) starring Boris Karloff and Jack Nicholson that hasn't really gained much recognition. And understandably so. Like Bela Lugosi, Karloff seemed to fall into numerous low budget B-movies after his initial fame of the Universal era reached its peak. This is one of those movies. For plot details, here's what the back of the DVD case reads:""The Terror features two screen legends in a most unlikely pairing, alby directed by horrormeister Roger Corman (with an assist by Francis For Cappola). Jack Nicholson plays Andre Duvalier, a lieutenant in the French Army, who falls in love with Helene (Sandra Knight), a mysterious woman who keeps appearing to him. He eventually follows her to an old creepy castle, where he meets the sinister Baron Von Leppe (Boris Karloff), and is held captive. As it turns out, Helene is the ghost of the Baron's late wife, or so we are led to believe. This atmospheric film is appropraitely moody and drenched with a feeling of dread. Numerous plot twists and surprises will keep you guessing right up to the film's end.""I think that synopsis exaggerates a bit. The story, while slightly clever and intriguing once completely revealed near the end, is a bit draggy and, not surprisingly, doesn't really hold the viewer's attention. Karloff's character isn't very interesting either. For such a star, it seems there should've been a little more substance and style that he could've fooled around with. Strangely enough, most scenes seemed to focus on the other star of the show, which is the only real reason I enjoyed The Terror. For Nicholson. I've long been a fan of Jack and his undeniable sense of charisma and screen presence. So, of course, I just had to see some of his older works. Here, he's in his mid-twenties, basically unknown in the film industry, and doesn't have too much to work with as far as his character goes. Regardless, he is given a lot of screen time, which makes up for what the script lacks. Sure, he's no RP McMurphy or Jack Torrance, but it's still fun to see. And about the whole ""French Army"" deal, don't worry, he doesn't use an accent. Despite a few changes of grammer and a corny suit, given the story is set in the seventeen/eighteen hundreds, he's still good 'ol Jack Nicholson.Now to the particular DVD edition I own -- the one from DigiView Productions. In addition to the already tattered age of the film, the transfer is pretty lousy. The color isn't very good at all, especially in the dark scenes. The sound could also use a little polishing, but overall it's still watchable. As far as everything else, well, there is a menu, but really no special features. Still, the price is unbeatable.All in all, The Terror is a decent film. Nothing beyond the ordinary for that era of horror flicks, but a young Nicholson makes it worth owning anyway. I'd just recommend, depending on your tolerance for transfer quality, that you consider what price you're willing to pay.",3,"Nice To See A Young Jack Nicholson, But That's About It",1141430400,"03 4, 2006",2006,2985,"['Terror', '1963', 'horror', 'film', 'actually', 'color', 'starring', 'Boris', 'Karloff', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', ""n't"", 'really', 'gained', 'much', 'recognition', 'understandably', 'so', 'Bela', 'Lugosi', 'Karloff', 'seemed', 'fall', 'numerous', 'low', 'budget', 'B-movies', 'initial', 'fame', 'Universal', 'era', 'reached', 'peak', 'one', 'movies', 'plot', 'details', 'here', 'what', 'back', 'DVD', 'case', 'Terror', 'two', 'screen', 'legends', 'most', 'unlikely', 'pairing', 'alby', 'directed', 'horrormeister', 'Roger', 'Corman', 'assist', 'Francis', 'Cappola', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Andre', 'Duvalier', 'lieutenant', 'French', 'Army', 'who', 'love', 'Helene', 'Sandra', 'Knight', 'mysterious', 'woman', 'who', 'appearing', 'eventually', 'old', 'creepy', 'castle', 'where', 'sinister', 'Baron', 'Von', 'Leppe', 'Boris', 'Karloff', 'held', 'captive', 'out', 'Helene', 'ghost', 'Baron', 'late', 'wife', 'are', 'led', 'believe', 'atmospheric', 'film', 'appropraitely', 'moody', 'drenched', 'feeling', 'dread', 'Numerous', 'plot', 'twists', 'surprises', 'will', 'keep', 'guessing', 'right', 'up', 'film', 'end', 'think', 'synopsis', 'bit', 'story', 'slightly', 'clever', 'intriguing', 'once', 'completely', 'revealed', 'end', 'bit', 'draggy', 'not', 'surprisingly', ""n't"", 'really', 'hold', 'viewer', 'attention', 'Karloff', 'character', ""n't"", 'very', 'interesting', 'either', 'such', 'star', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'little', 'more', 'substance', 'style', 'could', ""'ve"", 'fooled', 'Strangely', 'enough', 'most', 'scenes', 'seemed', 'focus', 'other', 'star', 'show', 'only', 'real', 'reason', 'enjoyed', 'Terror', 'Nicholson', ""'ve"", 'long', 'been', 'fan', 'Jack', 'undeniable', 'sense', 'charisma', 'screen', 'presence', 'So', 'course', 'just', 'had', 'see', 'older', 'works', 'Here', 'mid-twenties', 'basically', 'unknown', 'film', 'industry', ""n't"", 'have', 'too', 'much', 'work', 'as', 'far', 'character', 'Regardless', 'given', 'lot', 'screen', 'time', 'up', 'what', 'script', 'Sure', 'RP', 'McMurphy', 'Jack', 'Torrance', 'still', 'fun', 'see', 'whole', 'French', 'Army', 'deal', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', ""n't"", 'use', 'accent', 'few', 'changes', 'grammer', 'corny', 'suit', 'given', 'story', 'set', 'seventeen/eighteen', 'hundreds', 'still', 'good', ""'ol"", 'Jack', 'Nicholson.Now', 'particular', 'DVD', 'edition', 'own', 'one', 'DigiView', 'Productions', 'addition', 'already', 'tattered', 'age', 'film', 'transfer', 'pretty', 'lousy', 'color', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'especially', 'dark', 'scenes', 'sound', 'could', 'also', 'use', 'little', 'polishing', 'overall', 'still', 'watchable', 'As', 'far', 'everything', 'else', 'well', 'menu', 'really', 'special', 'features', 'Still', 'price', 'unbeatable.All', 'Terror', 'decent', 'film', 'Nothing', 'ordinary', 'era', 'horror', 'flicks', 'young', 'Nicholson', 'worth', 'owning', 'anyway', ""'d"", 'just', 'recommend', 'depending', 'tolerance', 'transfer', 'quality', 'consider', 'what', 'price', ""'re"", 'willing', 'pay']",N/A

Don't get me wrong, in many ways this movie is as terrible as anything Corman ever churned out, but at least it's jam-packed with atmosphere and scenery-chewing. Filmed just after Corman finished The Raven (he had five free days that had been budgeted for that one), Corman and his principal cast and crew knocked this one out, in Hollywood terms, overnight.The plot concerns one Andre Duvalier (Nicholson), separated from his regiment, who seeks shelter in a small house for the night after running into a lovely young woman who calls herself Helene (Knight) down by the sea. She drops hints that she can be found at the castle of Baron von Leppe (Karloff), and when Duvalier rides that way, he spies her in a window. Duvalier demands admittance, and the game is on: is Helene really a prisoner in the castle, or is she the ghost of Ilsa, von Leppe's wife, dead twenty years?While Nicholson and Karloff do the jobs expected of them, the real lynchpin of this movie is Stefan (Dick Miller), von Leppe's servant, who's never quite sure which side he's on in this battle of wills. He doesn't get as much screen time as the starts of the film, but what we see of him makes me wonder how much fun this could have been had he ended up as the main character. Still, he lends an intriguing presence to an otherwise dull film. The rest of it's pretty useless, with nary a scare to be found and very few thrills on top of that, but it's not an awful way to kill eighty minutes if you happen to be in the mood for Corman. **",2,Amusing Corman-factory output.,1223596800,"10 10, 2008",2008,1809,"['Terror', 'Roger', 'Corman', '1963', 'Corman', 'uncredited', 'team', 'co-directors', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'came', 'up', 'one', 'Corman', 'relatively', 'strongest', 'movies', 'here', 'pitting', 'Nicholson', 'Boris', 'Karloff', 'one', 'affections', 'Sandra', 'Knight', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'many', 'ways', 'movie', 'as', 'terrible', 'anything', 'Corman', 'ever', 'churned', 'out', 'least', 'jam-packed', 'atmosphere', 'scenery-chewing', 'Filmed', 'just', 'Corman', 'finished', 'Raven', 'had', 'five', 'free', 'days', 'had', 'been', 'budgeted', 'one', 'Corman', 'principal', 'cast', 'crew', 'knocked', 'one', 'out', 'Hollywood', 'terms', 'overnight.The', 'plot', 'concerns', 'one', 'Andre', 'Duvalier', 'Nicholson', 'separated', 'regiment', 'who', 'shelter', 'small', 'house', 'night', 'running', 'lovely', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'Helene', 'Knight', 'down', 'sea', 'hints', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'castle', 'Baron', 'von', 'Leppe', 'Karloff', 'when', 'Duvalier', 'way', 'window', 'Duvalier', 'admittance', 'game', 'Helene', 'really', 'prisoner', 'castle', 'ghost', 'Ilsa', 'von', 'Leppe', 'wife', 'dead', 'twenty', 'years', 'Nicholson', 'Karloff', 'do', 'jobs', 'expected', 'real', 'lynchpin', 'movie', 'Stefan', 'Dick', 'Miller', 'von', 'Leppe', 'servant', 'who', 'never', 'quite', 'sure', 'side', 'battle', 'wills', ""n't"", 'get', 'as', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'starts', 'film', 'what', 'see', 'wonder', 'how', 'much', 'fun', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'ended', 'up', 'main', 'character', 'Still', 'intriguing', 'presence', 'otherwise', 'dull', 'film', 'rest', 'pretty', 'useless', 'scare', 'be', 'found', 'very', 'few', 'thrills', 'top', 'not', 'awful', 'way', 'kill', 'eighty', 'minutes', 'happen', 'be', 'mood', 'Corman', '**']",N/A
