1271053,A3JWVMLYSYQOSJ,B002J6GHG4,"AlwaysLearning ""Happy2Be""","[2, 2]","I have purchased several chair-type exercise videos.  This one is unique in 3 ways:  up-to-date interval training, simultaneous exercise of upper and lower body, and modifications for beginners. I enjoyed the circulation boosting of the fast chair jogging and just when I started to get tired, the instructor changed to slower paced toning-type movement.  I like that the movements were easy and uncomplicated yes I got a nice workout.  I also appreciated the modifications demonstrated by the senior student.  You can tell she was a beginner and jogs a little slower and doesn't use weights during the movement.  Darryl, the instructor, is encouraging and explains the movements very well. I also liked that the music was not intrusive as many exercise videos have music that competes with the instructor.  I originally purchased this from the chair-a-cise website after viewing it on youtube.com.  I didn't know Amazon carried it at the time.",5,Sweating In a Chair?

1271054,A2L658RAOSOLDF,B002J6GHG4,Beverly,"[0, 0]","This workout is mostly done in a chair but it is a total body workout.  The instructor packs a lot into 30 minutes and you will definitely be sweating.  I like that the instructor uses light hand weights.  You can do the workout with the hand weights if its to intense.  I had to build up to using the weights throughout the program..  The instructor combines upper body work with lower body work making it a more efficient workout. Included in the workout is a good warm-up, cool-down, cardio, muscular conditioning and some core work.  I think the workout is 5 star.  I don't understand the misleading packaging, so I am lowering my rating to 4.",4,"Good Workout, Misleading Packaging",1368921600,"05 19, 2013",2013,647,"['workout', 'mostly', 'done', 'chair', 'total', 'body', 'workout', 'instructor', 'lot', '30', 'minutes', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', 'sweating', 'like', 'instructor', 'light', 'hand', 'weights', 'can', 'do', 'workout', 'hand', 'weights', 'intense', 'had', 'build', 'up', 'using', 'weights', 'program..', 'instructor', 'combines', 'body', 'work', 'lower', 'body', 'work', 'making', 'more', 'efficient', 'workout', 'Included', 'workout', 'good', 'warm-up', 'cool-down', 'cardio', 'muscular', 'conditioning', 'core', 'work', 'think', 'workout', '5', 'star', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'misleading', 'packaging', 'am', 'lowering', 'rating', '4']",N/A

I suffer from depression and like to exercise to help with it. I could only find my daughter's five pound weights to use and I could hardly keep up but I will get better with time God willing. You get to do cardio and ab work and weight lifting to build your muscles which we all know muscle burns fat. This is the best sit down workout I own. I have a bad knee due to all the weight I have and I was even able to do the squats I just modified them to half squats. I am also changing my diet to include more fruits and vegetables so I can lose twenty pounds by Christmas I am hoping. Buy this dvd if you are serious about losing weight and getting toned up. I really think this was a great investment.

1271056,A32S9N53PZQ9W6,B002J6GHG4,Nappy Reality,"[0, 0]",This dvd had the 3 characteristics that I need: 1)  You are able to workout to the DVD with the instructor.  2)  Motivating instructor.  3) Alternative variations for beginners.I own a few chair exercise dvds and this one is the best for a true overall aerobic and toning workout.  The movements are easy but you will SWEAT!  The instructor is motivating and I like that he counts the number of reps out loud.BTW the cover shown on Amazon is misleading.
